INTRODUCTION 

This book is designed for general use in classes 
to be taught under the supervision of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross Nursing Service. The aim of the 
course is to give in a simple way the underljdng 
principles of cookery. These are presented in 
fifteen lessons. There are also directions for four- 
teen lessons in practical cookery. For conven- 
ience a lesson in theory wiU usually be followed by 
one in practical cookery. For this reason one of 
each series of lessons is placed in each chapter of 
the book, in spite of the fact that this disturbs 
somewhat the logical arrangement of the subject- 
matter. 

The individual recipes are given for convenience 
in laboratory work. They may also be used if 
the teaching is done by the demonstration method 
unless it is desirable to prepare sufl&cient food to 
serve the class and then the home recipe may be 
used. Where meals are to be prepared, the home 
recipes are to be used and it will be convenient 
to have the pupils work in groups. Lack of time 
will often prevent the preparation of all the foods 
suggested in the practical lessons. 



VI INTRODUCTION 

The equipment needed will depend upon 
whether the demonstration method of instruction 
or individual laboratory practice is adopted. In- 
general, only cooking utensils are needed. 

The references given at the close of each lesson 
are confined to U. S. Government publications 
which can be obtained either free or at a nominal 
price. In cases where no price is given single 
copies may be obtained (as long as the supply 
lasts) by application to the Department from which 
they are published. If several copies of the same 
publication are desired for class use, the request 
should be made through a Member of Congress. 
When a price is mentioned, the publication may be 
purchased for that sum from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing OflSce, Washing- 
ton, D. C; remittances should be by coupons, 
postal money order, express order, or New York 
draft. 

To individual authors I may owe debts of which 
I am not aware, for my knowledge is an accumu- 
lation of material from various sources. The 
thoughts gleaned here and there have been inter- 
woven with my experience until a separation of 
that which belongs to others and that which is 
really my own seems impossible. I recognize 
clearly, though, that much of the best of my 



INTRODUCTION Vll 

material is the result of investigations made by the 
United States Government, particularly the 
Department of Agriculture. 

I wish to recognize here assistance which has 
been given me in preparing the work, by Anna G. 
Wetzel, teacher of dietetics, William Penn High 
School. Zeta B. Cundey, teacher of English, 
William Penn High School, has given me helpful 
criticism during the preparation of the manu- 
script. Dr. W. C. Rucker, Assistant Surgeon Gen- 
eral, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C, 
was kind enough to read and make useful sugges- 
tions for the last three lessons. To Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, Miss E. L. Hunt, and Miss H. W. 
Atwater, of the Office of Home Economics of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, I gratefully 
acknowledge my obligations for many suggestions 
and for very valuable constructive criticism.

LESSON I— SECTION A 

HYGIENE OF FOOD 

" Cleanliness is a most important consideration in cook- 
ing, for food materials may be the means of transmitting 
disease. True cleanliness must take into account free- 
dom not only from what we know as "dirt" but also the 
micro-organisms which commonly accompany filth and 
dirt." 

In the world about us are hundreds of forms of 
bacteria which are invisible to the naked eye. 
They thrive best where uncleanly conditions exist. 
Decasdng animal and vegetable matter is espe- 
cially conducive to their growth. Some of these 
forms are of great value to man but others are a 
menace to a healthy body. 

Flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are germ 
carriers and they should be carefully excluded 
from homes. Rats and even dogs and cats may 
spread disease. Danger also exists where dust 
collects for it may be laden with harmful forms of 
bacteria. Clean houses, clean clothing, clean 



2 HOME DIETETICS 

bodies, and clean food are then of the utmost 
importance. 

The person who prepares food should wear 
clean clothing, simple in style, which can be 
easily laundered. Woolen dresses or "cast off" 
finery are entirely out of place in the kitchen. 
The body should be kept clean by frequent baths, 
the hair should be neatly combed, and the nose 
and mouth should be kept in good condition. 
Special attention should be given to the hands. 
They should always be washed before handling 
food and especially after having been to the 
toilet. It is quite possible that harmful colon 
bacteria may be on the hands from just opening 
and shutting the door of the toilet. The finger 
nails should be free from dirt. Never dip any- 
thing but a clean spoon into food when tasting it. 

-The dishes in which food is placed or served 
should be clean. After use they should be care- 
fully scraped and piled in an orderly manner. 
Two pans of water are necessary for washing 
dishes; one with hot, soapy water, to remove the 
grease, and the other with boiling water for rinsing. 
Remember that high heat kills germs. It is far 
better to dry dishes by allowing the water to 
drain off from them than to wipe them on dirty 
towels. If they must be drained in a dusty place, 
they should be covered. Dish towels and dish 



HYGIENE OF FOOD 3 

cloths should be kept clean. Wash and rinse 
them each time after using. Frequent scalding 
is also necessary. It is better to wash the glass 
first, then the silver, and finally the china. 

Food should not be exposed to dust either in 
the home or in the market. Housekeepers should 
refuse to buy unwrapped bread, or other food 
that has been unnecessarily exposed. Wash fruit 
thoroughly before it is used. Loathsome dis- 
eases have been contracted from eatihg fruit 
handled carelessly or by diseased persons. Flour, 
sugar, and other foods that come in bags should be 
emptied into receptacles with tight covers. Re- 
move fresh meat from the wrapping paper, wipe 
with a clean, damp cloth, and set near the ice or 
in the safe in the cellar. Milk should be kept in 
a closed vessel and in a cool place. The outside 
of the milk bottle should be washed before the 
bottle is opened. Butter, if purchased in wooden 
trays, should be removed inmmediately to a 
covered vessel. Frequently scald and air re- 
ceptacles in which food is kept. Sunshine kills 
germs. 

A refrigerator or a screened safe in a cellar for 
storing food should receive careful attention. 
Bits of food spilled on the shelves invite bacterial 
growth. Clean often with scalding water and 
washing soda or some other good cleaning material. 



4 ' HOME DIETETICS 

Keep a strainer in the sink to prevent particles 
of food from obstructing the drainage. This 
should be emptied into the garbage can after the 
dishes are scraped. Wash and rinse the strainer 
andhang it above the sink. After the dish wash- 
ing is finished, wash every part of the sink with 
soap and hot water and use a strong solution of 
washing soda at least once a week. 

Thoroughly clean and scald the garbage pail 
after it is emptied. Unless a local law prevents, 
line the garbage can with old newspapers before 
it is used again. Always keep the can tightly 
covered when in use.

LESSON II.— SECTION A 
NUTRIENTS 

The problem of nutrition is one of growing im- 
portance, not only because of the increased cost 
of food but because more and more we are coming 
to realize that a healthy body is man's greatest 
asset. 

Food is technically defined as anything which, 
when taken into the body, is capable of building 
or repairing tissue or furnishing energy. The 
energy is used for performing internal muscular 
work, as the beating of the heart, and external 
muscular work, as chopping wood, walking, or 
plajdng ball. 

Our bodies are wonderful pieces of machinery, 
far more wonderful than anything man has made. 
A variety of foods is needed to keep their intricate 
parts in normal condition. Nature, through our 
instincts, has guided us to some extent in the choice 
of foods. Her dictates were the starting point of 
our understanding of the facts about food and 
nutrition. They laid the foundation of a science 
which is rapidly developing as the result of careful 
and painstaking laboratory studies. 

5 



6 HOME DIETETICS 

The scientist has classified the substances which 
make up our foods, or the nutrients, under five 
heads: water, mineral matters (ash), protein, car- 
bohydrates, and fats. 

Water ranks as food because it enters into the 
composition of every tissue, even bones and teeth. 
It regulates the body temperature and has a part 
to play in all nervous and muscular work. It has 
been estimated that two-thirds of the material in 
the human body is water, and since water is con- 
tinually passing off from the body there must be 
a constant supply of it. Our foods as they are 
prepared for the table are about one-half water. 
They supply part but not all of the water needed, 
and must therefore be supplemented by drinking 
water. Since water is known to be capable of 
carrying diseases the greatest care should be taken 
to keep the supply pure. 

Mineral substances play an important part in 
building the body and in its chemical reactions. 
There are many kinds used by the system. 
Among the most important are calcium (lime) 
salts, which are needed for bone formation. They 
are found abundantly in milk, eggs, cereals, and 
vegetables. Children need a considerable amount 
of calcium salts and for this reason special atten- 
tion should be given to them in the diet. Lack 
of calcium may show itself in the form of an ab- 



NUTRIENTS 7 

normal appetite for such substances as plaster, 
wood, or chalk, or in poor teeth. 

Iron is very important, for its presence in the 
hemoglobin of the blood makes oxygen-carrjdng 
possible. Iron salts are found in nearly all foods, 
but especially in beef, eggs, oatmeal and some of 
the green vegetables. 

Common salt (sodium chlorid) occurs in every 
tissue of the body except the enamel of the teeth, 
so it is important in our food. There are many 
other necessary mineral constituents, such as com- 
pounds of magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus, etc., 
and fortunately these are found in many of our 
staple foods. 

Protein suppUes nitrogen for tissue building. 
All people, old and young, need it to repair tissue 
waste. The growing child, however, needs it not 
only to repair waste but also for growth. There 
are several forms of protein, varying in composi- 
tion. It is probable that the different proteins 
supply nitrogen in forms suited to different bodily 
needs, but this subject is still a matter for discus- 
sion and investigation. Safety would therefore 
seem to he in the habitual use of a number of dif- 
ferent kinds of protein, which explains perhaps 
the general tendency of man toward a mixed diet. 
We may obtain it from the animal and also from 
the' vegetable kingdom, from milk, eggs, fish and 



8 HOME DIETETICS 

meat, and also from cereals, legumes and nuts. 
Protein not only supplies nitrogen for tissue build- 
ing but may also be used as a source of energy. 
It is drawn upon for this purpose more largely if 
fats, starches, and sugars are limited in the diet. 

The carbohydrates (starch, sugar, cellulose, 
etc.) can not supply nitrogen and so can not re- 
place the nitrogen of protein as a building material, 
but they can spare it as a source of energy. Car- 
bohydrates are obtained mainly from the vegetable 
kingdom. 

Starch is manufactured by growing plants and 
stored up in the form of tiny grains lying within 
the plant cells. We obtain the greater part of 
the starch of our diet from cereals and pota»toes. 

Sugars, except lactose or milk sugar, are ob- 
tained from the vegetable kingdom. By far the 
most abundant kind in our diet is sucrose, which 
is obtained chiefly from the sugar cane, the sor- 
ghum, and the beet. 

Fats, like carbohydrates, are incapable of re- 
placing protein as a source of nitrogen for body 
building and repair. They serve as a source of 
heat and energy and have an energy value, per 
pound, aj^ times that of protein or carbohydrates. 
We obtain them chiefly from meat, milk, eggs, and 
butter in the animal kingdom and from nuts, choc- 
olate, and olives in the vegetable kingdom. 



NUTRIENTS 9 

The body uses food as fuel, just as the engine 
uses coal. The unit^for measuring energy is the 
calorie and the fuel value of our various food mate- 
rials is therefore expressed in this term. It should 
be remembered, however, that the fuel value of 
a food is not its only value, for the body requires 
protein to supply nitrogen to build and repair tis-^ 
sue. It is important, therefore, to know of a given 
food not onjy its total fuel value but also what 
part of the fuel is in the form of protein.

LESSON III— SECTION A 

MEAT AND FISH 

Meat, and the term is used here to include 
poultry as wejl as beef, mutton, and so on, is an 
important and a very generally used source of 
protein. An ordinary serving of meat once a 
day (or a like amount divided between two or all 
three meals) is a reasonable quantity, but it does 
not follow that more is harmful. Too much meat 
in the diet, however, is not economical, since it is 
seldom a cheap source of energy, and many be- 
lieve that a large amount of meat protein imposes 
a needless tax on the digestive and excretory 
organs and may be an important contributing 
cause to intestinal putrefaction. A part of the 
supply of protein should be obtained from milk, 
eggs, legumes, etc. 

The lean portion of meat is composed of bundles 
of fibers held together by connective tissue. Al- 
bumin and gelatin are the principal proteins found 
in meat and they should always be considered 
when it is being prepared for food. Albumin is 
hardened by intense heat and gelatin is obtained 
from the connective tissue by long, slow applica- 
tion of heat, with moisture. 



MEAT AND FISH 1 3 

"Results of experiments show that there is no marked 
difference in ease of digestion of various kinds and cuts of 
meat. Over 9 S per cent, of the proteins and fat is digested ; 
which means that the nutrients of meat are largely used 
by the body with little waste. Therefore, those who wish 
to use the cheaper cuts of meat need not fear that in so 
doing their families will be less well nourished than by 
the use of more expensive cuts." C. F. Langworthy. 

As it occurs in our food the protein from meat 
is more readily digested and absorbed than the 
vegetable protein and there is reason to believe 
that it is more valuable to the body, since it is 
more like body protein in structure and so more 
readily used. 

When a muscle is exercised vigorously the con- 
nective tissue increases in amount and becomes 
hardened and the muscle is consequently hardened 
or toughened and the amount of extractives (sub- 
stances which give flavor) increased. Tough 
meats, as a rule, therefore, contain more flavor 
than the other meats. There are many good ways 
of making palatable dishes from them. The cuts 
of tough meat are usually less expensive and their 
use is economical, especially when the flavors are 
to be drawn out, as in soups and stews. The 
shank and chuck are examples of tough cuts. 

The muscles that are exercised slightly have 
softer and often more fat connective tissue and so 
are more tender. These meats make the fender

cuts, such as the tenderloin and sirloin of beef. 
They are the most expensive parts of meat and are 
commonly used for roasting and broiling, rather 
than for the long, slow cooking desirable for 
tougher cuts. 

Some muscles have a moderate amount of exer- 
cise and lie near the muscles which are exercised 
more vigorously. They have tender fibers and a 
fair proportion of juice, and may well be used for 
boiling and roasting. The top of the round and 
the rump are illustrations.

USES OF CUTS OF BEEF 

The chuck is excellent for stews. It makes a 
very good roast and is sometimes sold as steaks. 

The ribs are sold for roasts, being cut into one, 
two, and three-rib pieces. 

The loin includes the porterhouse, sirloin, and 
tenderloin steaks. They are the choicest and 
highest priced cuts in beef. 

The rump contains the end of the hip bone and 
the joint. The fleshy part makes very good steaks 
and roasts. 

The round consi&ts of a very juicy, lean muscle 
and contains but little bone. It is sold for roasts, 
steaks, beef tea, and beef juice. " 

The shanks are cut from the fore and the hind 
legs. They are tough and contain bones and ten- 
dons. They are used for soups and stews. 

The flank is boneless and coarse-grained but 
good in flavor. It makes a good rolled roast, or 
it may be used for stews. 

The navel and clod are used for soups and stews. 

The brisket makes a good pot roast; or it may 
be used for soups and stews. 

Fish. — Fish is an important , source of protein 
and may be used in the diet very much as meat 
is. It often contains less fat than meat and as 
has a lower fuel value, pound for pound. A so 



1 6 HOME DIETETICS 

source of fuel, therefore, lean fish, such as cod, 
might seem less economical even at a lower price 
than such cuts of beef as sirloin steak; but as a 
source of protein (the most expensive nutrient) it 
is much cheaper. The common practice of cook- 
ing fish with fat tends to compensate for its low 
fuel value. 

The different kinds of fresh fish are best at their 
peculiar seasons. Out of season they are inferior 
in flavor and have a disagreeable odor. In choos- 
ing fish, avoid those with dull eyes, pale red gills, 
and dry or easily-loosened scales. If the flesh is 
so soft when pressed with a finger, that the inden- 
tation remains, it is unfit for use. 

Fish is often preserved by salting, 'smoking, or 
pickling. In these forms it can frequently be ob- 
tained more cheaply than fresh. When dried dur- 
ing the preserving process the nutrients become 
more concentrated, so that even at the same price 
per pound a given sum would buy more nutrients 
than if spent for fresh fish. Although dried fish 
is perhaps not to be recommended for very young 
children, there is no reason to suppose that when 
properly prepared it is not perfectly wholesome 
for normal adults. Good canned fish also oflFers 
a convenient ^nd economical substitute for fresh 
fish or for meat. 



LESSON III— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF MEATS 

Fresh meat is firm to the touch and bright in 
color, red in the case of beef and mutton and red- 
dish pink in the case of pork and veal. The fat 
should be dry enough to crumble easily, and, in 
the case of beef, should be of a yellow color. The 
best beef is marbled with narrow lines of fat. 
When received from the market, meat should be 
taken from the paper and wiped thoroughly with a 
damp cloth. It should be covered and put in a 
a cool place. 

Tender meats should be cooked in their own 
juices to preserve the flavor. The juice may be 
kept in by hardening the albumin on the outside 
by means of high heat, as is the case when a broiled 
steak is put near the hot coals or a roast into a 
very hot oven. The temperature should then be 
lowered. There are three general ways of cooking 
tender meats: over hot coals, or broiling; pan 
broiling, or saut6ing; and roasting. Less com- 
monly tender meat (veal cutlet or chicken, for 
example,) is fried, either plain or crumbed, in deep 
fat. 

17 



1 8 HOME DIETETICS 

METHODS OF COOKING TENDER MEATS 

Broiling. — ^Place the meat on a greased broiler 
over hot coals or under the gas flame. Quickly 
sear over both sides to retain the juices; continue 
to turn often. Steak i inch thick will be cooked 
rare in 5 minutes, and well done in 6. minutes. 
There is a difference of opinion as to the best time 
to season broiled meat. If the seasonings are 
added before the broiling they penetrate the meat 
more thoroughly, but, on the other hand, the salt 
tends to draw out the juices. It is therefore better 
to add the seasonings at the end, to prevent waste 
of material. 

Pan Broiling. — Have the frjdng pan very hot 
and then grease it over with a small amount of 
fat. Bits of suet may be used for this purpose. 
Sear the meat over on both sides; then cook more 
slowly, turning the meat often. When sufl&dently 
cooked, remove to a hot platter and serve. 

A thick brown sauce or gravy may be made by 
stirring flour smoothly into the fat in the pan and 
then gradually adding hot water, stirring all the 
time. The method and proportions are the same, 
as used in making white sauce. (See p. 52.) 

Roasting. — Season the meat and dredge with 
flour. The starch grains of the flour under the 
influence of heat will form a pasty covering which 



COOKERY OF MEATS I9 

will aid in retaining the juices of the meat. Place 
uncovered on the grate in the oven of a coal range 
or in a hot gas range, and sear over, turning with 
a fork until the searing is complete. Then pour 
in at the side enough hot water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan and place the pan on the bottom 
of the oven, if a coal range is used. The meat 
should be frequently basted. A covered roasting 
pan is very desirable. The water is then poured 
into the lower pan after the meat is seared over 
and the cover put on. Basting is then unneces- 
sary, as the steam will keep the meat moist. 
Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat and, 
if the roast is more than 4 pounds, fifteen minutes 
more for the heat to penetrate. Brown sauce may 
be made in the pan after the roast is removed. 

METHODS OF COOKING TOUGH MEATS 

The principle followed in cooking tough meats 
is to cook slowly at not too high a temperature 
keeping the meat moist. Pot roasting, stewing 
and casserole cooking are examples. 

Pot Roast. — ^Tough cuts are used for pot roasts. 
The meat should be put into boiling water and 
boiled for ten minutes until the albumin is hard- 
ened on the outside, to retain the Juices. Season- 
ings should then be added and the meat cooked 



20 HOME DIETETICS 

slowly until it is tender. The latter process can 
be carried out very successfully in a fireless cooker. 
If desired, the roast may be browned in the kettle 
by letting the water simmer away. When the 
roast is removed a brown sauce may be made in 
the regular way. If the meat is removed before 
browning and a sauce made in which the roast is 
cooked, it is necessary to stir the flour until free 
from lumps in a small portion of water before 
adding it. 

Soup. — ^If soup is desired the meat should be 
placed in cold water and brought to the simmering 
point. Cook slowly until the fibers fall apart 
and seem tasteless. A good order for soup stock 
consists of four pounds of soup meat beef; one 
knuckle of veal, well broken; and one pound of 
marrow bone. In ordering any kind of meat ask 
that the trimmings and bones be sent, as they may 
be used to replenish the soup stock. 

Stewed Meats. — In stewing meats we have a 
two-fold purpose; that is, to keep part of the 
juices in to retain the flavor of the meat, and to 
extract part of the juices to flavor the gravy. 
This may be accomplished by putting the meat into 
cold water and quickly bringing it to the boiling 
point. It should then be cooked slowly until 
tender.

LESSON IV— SECTION A 

MILK AND EGGS 

Milk and eggs are extremely important foods, 
particularly in the diet of the young and of in- 
valids. Eggs contain only a trace of carbohy- 
drate. Milk contains milk sugar but no starch. 
In general, neither needs cooking except to make 
it more palatable, and in the case of milk, to lessen 
the danger from harmful bacteria. As eggs and 
milk, like meat, contain much protein as com- 
pared with other nutrients, cooking at a low tem- 
perature is desirable so that they may be soft and 
under, rather than over-cooked. 

Great care should be used in handling milk. 
We should demand that it be forwarded and 
delivered to us in a- sanitary condition. The 
milk bottle should be carefully washed before the 
cover is removed. The milk may be left in the 
bottle until used, or, if preferred, poured into a 
freshly scalded and covered vessel. It should be 
set in a cool, clean place, free from dirt, flies, etc. 
If left at a temperature of 50° F. or less, good milk 
should remain sweet for twenty-four hours or 
more. 

24 



MILK AND EGGS 25 

Much of the milk sold by dealers is pasteurized. 
This is to be distinguished from sterilized milk. 
Pasteurization is accompUshed by bringing milk 
to a temperature of 60° to 65° C. (140° to 149° F.) 
and holding it there for twenty minutes. Steril- 
izing milk means boiling it for a certain length of 
time or heating it nearly to the boiling point, allow- 
ing it to stand for some hours, and again heating 
it, repeating the operation several times. Boiled 
milk is very difficult for children to digest. Pas- 
teurized vnilk is preferable to boiled milk for this 
reason. It should not be necessary to depend on 
sterilizing or pasteurizing as a means of providing 
germ-free nulk. The milk should be produced 
under clean conditions, even if it is to be pas- 
seurized. Where there is any doubt as to the 
tanitary quaUty of the milk, it should be pasteur- 
ized. Pasteurized milk is much better for chil- 
dren than raw milk of questionable quality. It 
is the opinion of many authorities that babies fed 
on pasteurized milk thrive fully as well as those 
fed on raw milk. 

Eggs spoil because of the action of bacteria 
which are either included in them before they are 
laid, or, less often, enter later through the pores 
of the shell. Eggs should be kept in a cool, clean 
place. 

During the season when eggs are plentiful it is 



26 HOME DIETETICS 

economical to buy a supply and preserve them. 
The best method of preservation is by the use of 
water glass, which may be obtained at a drug 
store and diluted with water in the proportion of 
one part of water glass to five parts of pure water. 
Place the eggs in a clean stone jar and pour in the 
solution, leaving two inches of the liquid covering 
the top layer of eggs, and set in a cold place. 

Only clean, fresh eggs should be preserved. A 
good, fresh egg has a rough, dull shell and should 
not be smooth and shiny. If you are in doubt as 
to the freshness of eggs, candle them or see whether 
they sink when placed in a dish of fresh water. 
If an egg sinks it is reasonably fresh.

LESSON V— SECTION A 
CEREALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 

The cereals represent a fairly complete food, 
that is, one in which all the food principles are 
represented in good proportions. They are grown 
in all parts of the world except the arctic regions 
and therefore form staple foods of all countries. 
They are widely grown, easily stored in good con- 
dition, usable in many ways, may be readily 
prepared for the table, and are palatable and 
digestible. 

A study of the table shows that the cereals vary 
as to the proportion of nutrients but that carbo- 
hydrates predominate in all grains. The carbo- 
hydrates are mainly in the form of starch and this 
determines the general method of cereal cookery. 
The starch grains are stored up in cells whose 
walls are a tough cellulose. High temperature and 
long continued cooking are necessary to break down 
the ceU walls and to free the starch grains so that 
they may be acted upon by the digestive juices. 

The cereals are prepared for the table in a great 
variety of ways. Wheat, corn, and rye are the 

31 



32 CEREALS — GENERAL DISCUSSION 

grains which are most frequently ground into flour 
and used for breads. Buckwheat is used for 
griddle cakes. Served with gravy or butter and 
S37rup, buckwheat cakes are high in energy value. 
Rice is a valuable food and may well be used fre- 
quently as a vegetable or prepared as a dessert. 
Among the cereals used for breakfast fdods, oats 
are very valuable. Oatmeal is not only highly 
nutritious but it gives bulk which is necessary for 
digestion and excretion. 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixtures are divided into two chief 
classes — ^batters and doughs. Each class may be 
subdivided. A batter may be made of one part 
liquid to one part of flour, and is then termed a 
thin batter; or, it may be made in the proportion 
of one part of liquid to two parts of flour and then 
forms a thick batter. A dough made in the pro- 
portion of one part liquid to three of flour is called 
a soft dough; and if the proportion is one part 
liqtdd to more than three of flour, it is then a stiff 
dough. Griddle cakes, popovers, and ginger 
bread are types of thin batter. Cakes come under 
the head of thick batters, and the proportions 
should be kept in mind when a new recipe is being 
considered. The breads and pastry come under 



HOME DIETETICS 33 

the soft doughs, while cookies and crullers are 
stiff dough. 

Flour mixtures are raised or made light by means 
of leavens. The leavens most commonly used in 
bread making and for similar purposes are steam, 
air, and carbon di-oxide. The carbon di-oxide 
may be due to the growth of yeast or to the action 
of chemicals such as cooking soda and cream of 
tartar. The desired results are brought about 
by the action of definite physical laws, namely: 
that water converted into steam produces a force 
which tends to expand a mixture enclosing it, and 
that air or gas (carbon di-oxide), also expands 
when heated, producing a similar result. The 
flour is sifted and the egg is beaten to catch and 
hold the tiny quantities of air which may expand 
and make the mixture light, under the influence 
of heat during cooking. 

In using recipes for flour mixtures, remember 
that flour should always be sifted before measuring 
and that measurements should always be accurate, 
a knife being used to level off the flour at the top of 
the measuring cup or the baking powder in the tea 
spoon. If care is used there is no such thing as 
"luck" in baking; the results are always the same 
if the conditions are always the same.

LESSON V— SECTION B 
MAKING OF CAKE AND PASTRY 

CAKE MAKING 

All cakes may be classified under one of two 
headings; that is, they either contain fat and are 
then called butter cakes, or they do not contain 
fat, and are then called sponge cakes. The general 
method of handling each type is illustrated by the 
"plain cake" and the "hot water sponge cake." 
If a butter cake of very fine quality is desired, 
separate the egg, using only the beaten yolk at 
first, then fold in the beaten white just before the 
mixture is poured into the baking pan. 

GENERAL RULES FOR BAKING 

In baking, divide the time into quarters. First 
quarter, mixture should begin to rise. 

Second quarter, mixture continues rising and 
begins to brown. 

Third quarter, mixture continues browning. 

Fourth quarter, mixture finishes baking and 
shrinks from pan. 

3S 



36 HOME DIETETICS 

Cake should often be looked at during the bak- 
ing. If the oven door is opened and closed care- 
fully there is no danger of the cake falling. 

Cake should not be moved in the oven until it 
is fully risen. After this time it may be moved 
so that it will brown evenly. 

Cake, when done, shrinks from the pan and does 
not retain indentation if pressed with the finger. 
It is wise to test with a small toothpick. If the 
toothpick comes out clean the cake is thoroughly 
done. 

Cake will crack if too much flour has been used, 
or if the oven is too hot.

PASTRY 

The use of pastry and its ease of digestion is a 
subject concerning which there is much disagree- 
ment. In general, it may be said that a tender, 
rich pastry is just as fully digested as many more 
simple foods, but a tough or "soggy" pastry niay 
prove difficult of digestion. In the case of any 
digestive disorders, especially intestinal, it is wiser 
to omit pastry from the diet. 

Pastry consists of fat and starch which makes it 
a very concentrated food. It should therefore be 
considered as a substantial food rather than as a 
delicacy to be added to an already sufficient meal. 
More trouble comes from overeating, when pie is 
used as a dessert at a hearty meal, than from the 
indigestibihty of the pastry itself. 



38 HOME DIETETICS 

The air incorporated in the mixture and the 
steam generated from the water used, are the 
leavens which make pastry light. It is necessary- 
then to sift the flour, to cut in the fat, and to 
handle the dough lightly so that as much air as 
possible may become entapgled in the mixture. 
If properly handled, a lighf, flaky product should 

always result.

LESSON VI— SECTION A 
CEREALS— BREAD MAKING 

Wheat, corn and rye are the grains most com- 
monly used in bread making. The wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making as it contains the 
gluten (a protein) in the right proportions and of 
the right nature to form a spongy loaf. Except 
for a slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a per- 
fect food and we supply the need by the addition 
of butter. Rye ranks next to wheat in importance 
for bread making, but it is best used in combina- 
tion with wheat, because alone, it makes a heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn needs to be combined 
with wheat also, for if used alone the bread is 
crumbly, owing to the lack of gluten. 

In a cross-section of wheat three distinct parts 
are found; the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. 
The outside coat or bran is fibrous material, con- 
taining valuable mineral matter, protein, and 
a pigment which gives the wheat a brown color. 
The germ is the tiny plantlet or embryo. When 
growing, the little plant needs nourishment before 
it can get to the earth; so "Mother Nature" stores 

40 



CEREALS — REREAD MAKING 



41 



up a supply in the endosperm. The endosperm 
is made of irregular cells, separated by walls of 
delicate woody fiber or cellulose. Packed away 
in the cells are tiny grains of starch. The spaces 



GERM 




BRAN 



e/msKRM 



Fig. 3. — Cross-section op Wheat. 

between the grains are filled principally with 
gluten. 

There are several varieties of wheat flour, de- 
pending upon the part of the grain used. Graham 
flour is made from the whole grain. The food 



42 HOME DIETETICS 

value is high because of the presence of the germ 
which contains a larger portion of fat than the 
rest of the seed. For this very reason though the 
flour will not keep as the fat becomes rancid. 
There is a large proportion of minerals and also of 
protein, but the protein is stored up in the coarse, 
indigestible bran; so, graham flour often has a 
slightly smaller amount of digestible protein than 
fine white flour. In whole wheat flour the outer 

husks and the germ are removed; 

while in the higher grade white 

flours all the bran is removed; 

that is, only the endosperm is 

used. 
Pastry flour is made from 
Pr^ ^i vt-.c winter wheat, which contains 
Highly Magnified, less gluten than spring wheat, 

from which bread flour is made. 
The pastry flour is cheaper, being made from lower 
priced wheat. In using bread flour in place of 
pastry flour for cakes, etc., the general rule is to 
use two tablespoons less to a cupful. 

Fermented is the term sometimes applied to 
breads in which yeast is used as a leavening agent. 
The yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant which grows 
by the simple process known as budding. Yeast, 
like any other plant, needs light, heat, and mois- 
ture for its growth. The temperature most favor- 




CEREALS — REREAD MAKING 43 

able is from 70° to 75°F. If colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above 9o°F. 
the conditions are favorable for the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria and the bread "sours." Sugar 
feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is 
to some extent converted into sugar and thereby 
serves the same purpose. Salt retards the growth 
of the yeast somewhat, but we add it because it 
seems necessary to season the bread to our taste. 
The soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the 
yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxid. The carbon-dioxid gas becomes en- 
tangled in the gluten, and by expansion when 
heated, raises the bread. 

We begin the bread with either a sponge or 
"hard loaf," using liquid, dry, or compressed 
yeast. The compressed yeast proves very satis- 
factory, but should never be used unless light in 
color and without dark streaks. The bread should 
be kneaded thoroughly in order to incorporate the 
ingredients. It should be covered and set in a 
warm place until its bulk is doubled. The second 
kneading breaks up the bubbles of gas, thus pre- 
venting the formation of large holes in the bread; 
and spreads the fermentation through the mixture. 
During the second kneading add as little flour as 



44 HOME DIETETICS 

possible. Shape and put into greased^ pans and 
again let it rise to double its bulk. 

The bread is baked to kill the ferment; to render 
the starch more soluble, and therefore, more 
digestible; to drive off the alcohol; to expand the 
carbon-dioxid and thus raise the mixture and 
to improve the flavor. The oven must be hot 
enough to raise the loaf to a temperature of 2i2°F. 
The best temperature for the oven is from 400° 
to 500°. 

The bread shrinks from the pan when it is 
done, does not crack, and gives a hollow sound 
when tapped. Remove from the pan and cover 
lightly to cool.

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Breakfast cereals are speciaUy milled or other- 
wise prepared foods, some of which are partially, 
others thoroughly, cooked at the factory. The 
uncooked cereal breakfast foods require long and 
slow cooking in order to break down the cell walls 
and f jee the stored starch grains so that they may 
be readily acted upon by the digestive juices. If 
a coal range is constantly in use the problem is

LESSON VII— SECTION A 
MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Meats are common sources of protein and fat 
in the diet. These constituents can be and are ob- 
tained from other foods in greater or smaller pro- 
portion. Milk and eggs (see Lesson III) and 
cheese are common substitutes for meat, and so 
are the dry legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, 
etc.). Nuts are also used. 

Cheese. — Cheese is a concentrated form of food. 
It is rich in both protein and fat. In combination 
with starchy food it may frequently be used as a 
substitute for meat. Experiments have proved 
that cheese does not ordinarily cause indigestion 
and neither is it a frequent cause for constipation. 

Cheese should be kept wrapped in a slightly 
damp cloth or in paraffin paper and then in wrap- 
ping paper. It should be kept in a cool place. 
Never cover cheese in a dish from which the air 
has been wholly excluded, as it molds more readily 
under such conditions. 

Legumes. — Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
contain a larger percentage of protein than other 
vegetables, and a majority of these show a high 
percentage ^f carbohydrate. ,In addition the

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 5 1 

In view of the low cost and high nutritive value, 
dried legumes should be used frequently; not only 
as a meat substitute but to give a pleasing variety 
to the diet. 

Care in the preparation of legumes is very im- 
portant both as regards the digestibility and the 
flavor. The dried legumes should be soaked over 
night in water to which a little baking soda has 
been added. These vegetables require long cook- 
ing to soften the cellulose and also to develop the 
flavor. A little soda added to the water in which 
they are cooked also aids in softening the cellulose 
and neutralizes the vegetable acid found in some 
of the legumes. 

Although these foods are comparatively cheap 
the fuel required to cook them so long a time may 
increase their cost unless they are prepared on a 
day when the range is being used for other pur- 
poses, as, for laundry. The fireless cooker is sat- 
isfactory in cooking these dried foods. 

Nuts. — Nuts serve as an excellent source of 
energy and may replace, to a considerable extent, 
other proteins in the diet. They are a concen- 
trated food and therefore need, even more than 
meat, to be accompanied by fresh vegetables or 
fruits or other watery and bulky foods. When 
added to an already hearty meal, nuts may be the 
cause of digestive disturbances.

LESSON VIII— SECTION A 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Vegetables, except beans, peas and other 
legumes, are usually poor in protein and fat and 
owe their nutritive value largely to carbohy- 
drates. The latter consist mainly of starch, 
cellulose, and small amounts of sugar. They also 
contain relatively large proportions of important 
mineral nutrients. It should be remembered that 
vegetables often are more than haK water and 
that their fuel value is therefore lower than might 
be supposed from their bulk. This bulk, however, 
is often useful in the diet (see p. i lo) and does not 
lessen the value of vegetables in the ordinary diet. 

In cooking, starchy vegetables should be placed 
in boiling water or in a hot oven, as the case may be, 
as experience has shown that this gives the best 
results. Vegetables should not be salted until 
they have been cooking about ten minutes, be- 
cause the salt tends to draw out the juices. 

Vegetables having a sweet, mild-flavored juice, 
as string beans and green peas, should be cooked 
in a covered utensil in a small quantity of water, 

56 



VEGETABLES AND FETHTS 57 

which is served with the vegetable. Vegetables 
having a strong juice, as onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower, should be cooked in an uncovered 
utensil in a large quantity of water, which is not 
usually served with the vegetable but which may 
be used for soup making. In the first class, the 
purpose is to retain all the sweetness and flavor; 
in the second class, the purpose is to make the 
vegetables more palatable and less likely to cause 
digestive disturbance by modifying the flavor. 
With potatoes the matter of quantity of water is 
one of convenience chiefly. 

Great care should be taken not to overcook 
vegetables, as this injures the color and flavor and 
may make them hkely to cause digestive disturb- 
ances. Cook only long enough to make them 
tender. 

Fruits. — The nutritive value of fresh fruits, in 
proportion to their bulk, is low and is duelargely 
to the sugar and the mineral matters present. 
After drying, fruits are much richer than when 
fresh, dates, raisins, figs, and primes containing 50 
to 75 per cent, of grape and other sugars. Fruits 
are valuable in the dietary chiefly because of the 
salts and acids which they contain and because of 
the bulk of water and cellulose or woody fiber. 
These things tend to stimulate digestion and ex- 
cretion and the mineral salts are important for 



58 HOME DIETETICS 

body building and for other physiological purposes. 
Some dried fruits and fruit juices, like many of the 
fresh fruits, are useful for their laxative properties. 
As fruits ripen, starch and similar carbohydrates 
are changed into sugar, flavor develops, and tex- 
ture softens. As a whole, fruits are well digested. 
Stewed fruits, as a rule, are preferable to raw for 
young children because of the softening of cellulose 
during cooking and because bacteria which may be 
in the raw fruit are destroyed.

COOKERY OF VEGETABLES 

BOILED POTATO 

Wash in cold water and remove bruised or decayed places. 
If skins are removed, put the pared potatoes at once into cold 
water, so that they will not turn dark. "If they are cooked with 
the skins on, more of the mineral matter just under the skin is 
retained. If potatoes vary in size, cut the larger ones in two 
pieces. Put into boiling water and cook until tender. The 
water should boil all the time, but not too hard. Salt at the 
end of ten minutes. When tender, drain off the water, remove 
lid, shake the saucepan gently over the stove, cover with a cloth, 
and stand on the back of the stove. 

BAKED POTATO , 

Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to i hour, turning once or 
twice. When soft, break the skin, to allow the steam to escape, 
and serve at once. 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

To cream vegetables, use one cupful of cooked vegetables, cut 
into one-half inch cubes, to one cupful of medium-thick white 
sauce. (Seep. S2-) Heat in oven or on top of stove and serve 
at once. 

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream of vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable 
dish to serve at luncheon or supper. Great care should be used 
in combining acid vegetables, such as tomatoes, with milk, as 

61 



62 HOME DIETETICS 

the milk may curdle and spoil the texture of the dish. A very 
small quantity of soda added to the pur6e (strained vegetable 
pulp) will neutralize the acid and then it may be added to the 
milk. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Cook vegetables until soft. Strain the vegetables and keep 
the stock in which they are cooked. 

Make a thin white sauce, using i tb. butter, i tb. flour, J^ t. 
salt, and }i t. pepper, to i c. liquid (milk or stock, or part of 
each). 

Add the strained vegetable (purfie) to the white sauce, then 
reheat and serve at once. 

Onion or other seasoning vegetable may be cooked with the 
vegetables and discarded just before straining.

LESSON IX— SECTION A 
DIGESTION 

The process of digesfion includes the changes 
which the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
before it can be absorbed into the body tissue. 
The food is taken into the mouth where it is 
ground by the teeth and mixed with the saliva. 
Some of the starchy portion is changed to sugar 
by an enzym or ferment, known as "ptyalin," 
•which is present in the salivary secretion. It was 
formerly believed that this transformation of 
starch to sugar was largely accomplished in the 
mouth but it is now recognized that only a small 
portion of the starch is changed in the. mouth. 
However, this does not lessen the need of thor- 
oughly chewing the food, since it is more readily 
acted upon by the other digestive fluids in the 
stomach and intestine after being finely divided 
and softened by the saliva. 

On being swallowed the food goes beyond volun- 
tary control and is carried by the action of invol- 
untary muscles through the esophagus or tube 
leading from the mouth into the stomach. 

64 



DIGESTION 65 

In the stomach the food is acted upon by the 
ferments pepsin and rennin, which are present in 
the gastric juice, secreted by glands in the walls 
of the stomach. Mingled with the gastric juice 
is free hydrochloric acid, the presence of which is 
necessary to render the pepsin active. The pep- 
sin acts upon the protein components of the food 
and breaks them down into simpler soluble sub- 
stances (proteoses and peptones), which in turn 
undergo further changes in the intestine. The 
rennin causes the curdling or coagulation of the 
protein in milk and this seems to be necessary for 
the action of the pepsin. The explanation of the 
action of rennin is not definitely known, since the 
coagulated mass of milk protein must be dissolved 
again and rennin is present in the stomachs of 
animals not eating milk as a part of their normal 
diet. 'The ferments of the stomach have no effect 
upon the starchy portion of the food but the ac- 
tion of the ptyalin from the saliva continues for 
some time after the food reaches the stomach. 
Generally speaking, the fats in the food are not 
acted upon by the gastric ferments to any great 
extent but the cell walls which enclose the fat are 
dissolved and the fat is set free. The digestive 
changes which take place in the stomach, like the 
hydrolysis of starch in the mouth, are regarded 
as largely of a preliminary character. 



66 HOME DIETETICS 

From the stomach the food passes into the small 
intestine through which it is propelled by the peris- 
taltic movements and where the most important 
digestive changes take place. In the intestine 
are three secretions — the bUe, the pancreatic juice, 
and the secretions from the glands in the walls of 
the intestine itself. All of these secretions are 
alkaline and neutralize the acid brought in with 
the food from the stomach so that the digestive 
processes which take place in the intestine are 
carried out in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium. 

The pancreatic secretion contains an enzym 
known as "pancreatic amylase" or "amylopsin," 
which acts Hke the ptyalin of the saliva aild com- 
pletes the transformation of the starch into sugar. 
The pancreatic secretion also contains an enzym 
known as "steapsin" or "lipase," which hydrol- 
izes the fatty portions of the food, splitting them 
up into glycerin and fatty acids. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enzym, trypsin, which completes 
the process of breaking the protein components 
of the food down into peptones and breaks these 
peptones down still further into simpler com- 
pounds, called amino acids. 

The secretions of- the intestine contain the en- 
zyms maltase, lactase, and invertase, which split 
the more complex sugars into simpler forms. 

After the various components of the food have 



DIGESTION 67 

been broken down into simpler substances they 
are absorbed through the. walls of the digestive 
tract by the blood system and utilized by the 
body. Absorption begins in the stomach where 
mineral salts and some soluble peptones may be 
taken up by the blood, but most of it is done in 
the intestine.

68 



COOKERY or FRUITS AND MAKING OF SALADS 69 

Salads made of fresh green vegetables have little 
nutritive value except from the dressing served on 
them and' the mineral matters which they some- 
times provide. They are suitable to serve at 
dinner after a substantial course. The material 
used in them should be crisp and cold and the 
dressing should be added at the table or just be- 
fore the salad is served. 

Salads of substantial materials such as meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese, may well form the main 
course at luncheon or supper. It is quite common 
after cutting the materials in the proper shape and 
form, to mix a little oil and vinegar with them some 
time before serving, so that these may be absorbed. 
Such salads are often combined with crisp, fresh 
vegetables, which should be treated as described 
in the preceding paragraph. 

French dressings are more suitable for light 
salads of fruit and vegetables; and mayonnaise, 
cooked, or cream dressings for the heavier salads.

LESSON X— SECTION A 
FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 

"A dietary is that amount and combination of 
food which will keep a person in full health pro- 
vided he is normal to begin with." Ellen H. 
Richards. 

A dietary standard is a guide for home and 
institution management, rather than expressive of 
physiological requirement, as the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture points out. The standard 
for an individual depends upon many conditions. 
A man doing muscular work in the open air re- 
quires more food than a man leading a sedentary 
life. A man in the prime of life needs more food 
than either an older man or a boy. In general, a 
man needs more food than a woman because of his 
larger body and more vigorous life. Individuality 
plays an important part in choosing food for a 
particular person. A person may like this or 
that and refuse to touch what he does not Uke. 
This is largely the result of training. A child 
should be taught to eat a variety of foods, includ- 
ing fruits and vegetables. Climate and season 

72 



FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 73 

affect the appetite. In cold weather more heat- 
produdng foods are needed, provided a person 
spends much time out of doors. 

Scientists have estimated that as a general rule 
a man at active work needs about 3000 calories of 
food per day; that a woman needs about 2400 
calories per day; that a^ boy from ten to six- 
teen years of age needs 2400 to 2700 calories 
of food per day. If very active, as he is when 
playing football or other active games, or at 
work, the boy needs a diet with much higher 
energy value — ^3000 or 4500 calories, even. A 
girl from ten to sixteen years of age needs from 
1800 to 2400 calories per day. A younger child 
needs from 900 to 1500 calories per day. The pro- 
tein is less definitely determined than the energy, 
but 80 to ICO grams for 3000 calories of energy is a 
generally accepted figure. The dietary standard, 
to be consistent, should include figures for mineral 
matter, but these are difficult to give. It is gen- 
erally assumed, therefore, that a mixed diet 
including milk and vegetables and supplsdng 3000 
calories per day will provide the needed mineral 
matter. 

These figures express amounts of food, which 
seem rather difficult to understand, but when, in 
addition, the proportion of nutrients is' considered, 
the problem is difficult. It is not possible for the

average housewife to attempt to make accurate 
dietetic calculations. In fact, after the calcula- 
tions were made it would be necessary to see that 
each individual at the table had his particular 
portion if he were to have a so-called "balanced 
ration." 

The problem has been simplified by Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, and the preceding table with the 
suggestions for its use are based upon his work. 

"The division must be more or less arbitrary, 
for some foods could go almost equally well in two 
or more groups. Thus milk, which is a general 
food, is included with the protein foods because 
it is a valuable source of this nutrient." Potatoes 
contain a large percentage of starch but their 
value for minerals has been used to determine their 
grouping. 

To obtain a fair estimate of the amount of food 
required by an individual, the approxima,te ico 
calorie portions may be used. Suppose John is an 
adult at active work. -He needs about 3000 
calories of food. His meals may consist of the 
following menus, and thissingle illustration which , 
can not be said to represent an unusually generous 
diet and which yet furnishes 3000 calories of 
energy, shows that people probably err in eating 
too much rather than in eating too little.

There is much evidence for the conclusion that a

pounds, and engaged in moderately active, phys- 
ical work requires about loo grams of protein per 
day. Dr. Langworthy states that a mixed diet 
which includes the five food groups (see table p. 
74) and which supplies from 3000 to 3500 calories 
of energy per day almost inevitably supplies the 
needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. 
The diet is more likely to meet this requirement 
when milk is included in it. " To be more exact 
a dietary standard should also include figures 
expressing mineral requirements and require- 
ments for vitamines (regulating substances) of 
which minute amounts at least are essential. 
With present knowledge it is difl&cult to give such 
data. It is believed, however, that a general mixed 
diet will provide what is needed of both these."

LESSON XI— SECTION A 
BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 

In making out a bill-of-fare, a consideration of 
the various nutrients is important. Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy has simplified this part of the problem 
so that guided by the table on page 74, it is 
possible to plan meals furnishing the nutrients in 
fairly accurate proportions. In using the lists 
from the table to form menus, it is necessary that 
each group be represented, if not at every meal, at 
least once a day. "The use of an excessive num- 
ber of food materials from any one group would 
result not only in making less appetizing meals but 
an undesirable proportion of food principles." 

The natural appetite tends to protect people 
from eating too much of one kind of food. With 
a few exceptions like bread and butter, the same 
kind of food should not be served twice at the 
same meal. Bean soup followed by a main course 
including baked beans would pall the sense of 
taste. Avoid monotony. It may be convenient 
for the housewife always to serve corned beef on 
Monday, hash on Tuesday, and so on, but it 
is very undesirable as far as attractiveness is 

80 



BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 8 1 

concerned. A schedule for 14 days can be much 
more safely used than one for 7 days. A knowl- 
edge of what is to be served often causes the mind 
to rebel against the food and this results in a loss 
of appetite. On the other hand, a surprise due 
to an unexpected dish .stimulates the appetite. 

The market order must be carefully made out 
so that the supplies shall be at hand when the 
preparation for a meal begins. A thrifty house- 
keeper plans her meals so well that there are few 
remnants except those she definitely desires for one 
of the many palatable "left-over" dishes. It is 
cheaper to buy food in large quantities but this is 
possible only when there is a suitable place for 
storage. 

The cost of food must be considered in planning 
meals. It is necessary tg remember that the 
cheapest food is not always the most economical. 
If we buy a cheap cut of meat it is usually tough, 
and by the time it is <:ooked and the cost of the 
gas added to the first cost it may prove more 
expensive than a more tender piece. -However, 
if there is a fire in the coal range, anyway, or if a 
fireless cooker is used, there is economy in the 
cheaper cut. Vegetables and fruits used out of 
season are no more nourishing than when they 
are more abundant and cheaper and they are 
an extravagance for the average family. 



82 HOME DIETETICS 

Unnecessary waste should be avoided. Some 
vegetables and fruits have to be pared, cored, etc., 
but the waste may be reduced to the minimum. 
Potatoes may be carefully scrubbed and, then 
boiled, and the outside skin removed before they 
are served. The flavor is not only better but the 
valuable mineral matter is retained. Ask the 
butcher to send home the trimmings of meat. 
The bones and lean meat may be used for soup 
stock. The fat can be tried out and used for 
shortening. Chicken fat thus prepared is excel- 
lent for cake. 

Labor spent in the preparation of food should 
be considered. Is not the housewife's energy of 
some value? A mother might far better prepare 
simpler meals, even though they are somewhat 
more expensive, than to work so hard that she 
comes to the table too tired to enjoy the meal with 
her family.

LESSON XII— SECTION A 
SERVING FAMILY MEALS 

In most homes some of the members of the 
household are engaged in occupations which re- 
quire them to be away during the greater part 
of the day. As a result of this the meal time, 
especially at night, is the only opportunity for 
real enjoyment in the family circle. Careful 
thought should therefore be given to planning 
and furnishing the dining-room. 

It should be a room large enough to meet the 
needs of the family, with an allowance for the 
occasional guest. There should be plenty of 
windows to admit light, air, and sunshine. A 
pleasant outlook is also desirable. 

The woodwork may be painted white or stained 
and varnished to harmonize with the furniture. 
The walls should be covered with a simple, plain 
paper which harmonizes with the rug and the 
furniture. The ceiling should be lightest in 
tone, the walls medium, and the rug darkest. 
A dark, cold room needs a warm toned paper, 
say one of yeUow-brown, while a gray green or 
blue may be used on a warm, sunny room. A 

86 



SERVING FAMILY MEALS 87 

few pictures may be used, but a plate rail or any 
other "dust catcher" is undesirable. 

Direct artificial light which produces a glare 
is unpleasant in its effects. Either side lights or 
the modern indirect lighting is much better. The 
window curtains should be of a soft, simple 
material, such as muslin or scrim. The curtains 
are pleasing and they are also more sanitary if 
they are fastened to a small rod and then allowed 
to hang in straight folds which just clear the 
window siU. If more light is needed or if there 
is a beautiful outlook, slide the curtains from the 
center and fill the gap at the top with a piece of 
the curtain which is nine to twelve inches in length. 
. Have only such furniture in the room as is 
reajly necessary. A table, chairs, and a sideboard 
or serving table are sufficient. It should be simple 
but substantial. Furniture which is made along 
plain lines and without ornamentation is in good 
taste. Choose chairs which have the lines of the 
back following the curve of the human body, as 
they will be much more comfortable. 

The Hnen should be simple in design and should 
be of good quality. There is no economy in 
buying cheap linen. The china, glass, and silver 
are also in better taste if they are either perfectly 
plain or are decorated near the edge with a simple, 
conventional design. Avoid gilt on cheap dishes.

HOME DIETETICS 



A table cloth may be used with propriety at 
any meal, but doilies are permissible for break- 
fast and luncheon. When a cloth is used, a 
silence cloth of asbestos or canton flannel should 
be placed on the table first. This not only dulls

sounds but serves to protect the table. The 
table cloth should be placed on the table with the 
long fold lengthwise. A small, low growing plant 
or a few cut flowers give a touch of beauty to the 
table. A simple white doily may be used under 
the dish holding tTie plant. 



SERVING FAMILY MEALS 89 

Only the silver, glass, and china needed should 
be placed upon the table. They should be ar- 
ranged as indicated on the diagram. The silver 
is placed in order of use from the outside toward 
the plate; that is, a soup spoon should be placed 
still farther to the right if soup is to be the first 
course. 

With a simple home service it is important that 
all the food, dishes, etc., needed for a particular 
course, be on the table. Hot food should be 
served on hot dishes and cold food should be served 
on cold dishes. A wheel tray is convenient for 
such a service, and every woman doing her own 
work should not only own one, but should learn 
to use it. A very satisfactory wagon can be made 
by fastening a wooden tray upon the wheels of an 
old baby carriage.

LESSON XIII— SECTION A 

FOOD FOR infants AND YOUNG 
CHILDRENi 

Each year greater attention is given to the care 
and feeding of infants, so that they may be 
properly nourished and developed , into healthy 
citizens, prepared to meet the responsibilities of 
life. To bring about these results the care must 
start with the birth of the child and continue 
throughout the years of growth and development. 

Nature's food, mother's milk, is most desirable 
for infants because it contains all the necessary 
nutrients in the right proportions to properly 
nourish the child. No perfect substitute for 
mother's milk, has been obtained. It is necessary, 
however, to resort to artificial feeding when no 
milk is secreted, when the mother is delicate, or 
when the child does not thrive on mother's milk. 
Cow's milk is the usual substitute for mother's 
milk, but to be fed successfully to an infant it 
needs modifying to make it more nearly like 
mother's milk. Water may be added to it to 
reduce the protein and other nutrients; cream, to 

^ A practical demonstration of the care of bottles, nipples, etc., 
should- be given with this lesson. 

92 



rOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN 93 

increase the fat; milk-sugar, to increase the car- 
bohydrates; and sometimes lime water, to make 
the milk alkaline. If it becomes necessary to 
resort to artificial feeding, it is best to consult 
the family physician, who will either give a formula 
for modifying, or give directions how to obtain 
modified milk. 

In order that the infant may be healthy and 
thrive, whether breast-fed or ' bottle-fed, it is 
necessary not only to have the right food, but also 
to feed it regularly, to be sure that everything is 
kept in perfectly sanitary condition, to keep the 
child quiet after it is fed, and to allow it to sleep 
two or three hours after each feeding. 

After the first six or eight months, the physician 
may begin to prescribe simple gruels, etc., until 
the child can take whole milk. When the child is 
about fourteen months old, thicker cereals are some- 
times ordered. They should be thoroughly cooked 
for about three hours, and then strained. They 
may be fed from a spoon. 

By the end of the first year the normal child 
should be taking eight or nine ounces of food at 
a time, five times a day. During the second year 
the lime water and milk sugar may be gradually 
omitted and broth (mutton, veal, or chicken) and 
egg-white added. Orange Juice and beef juice 
may also be given. 



94 HOME DIETETICS 

During the third year the child is given a 
greater quantity of solids. Potatoes and other 
vegetables are introduced into the diet. 

Detailed directions for feeding infants may be 
obtained from some recognized authoritative 
book, such as Holt's "The Care and Feeding of 
Children." 

When a child is old enough to be given solid 
foods, it is very essential to his health that he be 
allowed plenty of time for his meals and that he 
learn to masticate his food thoroughly. Food 
should be given at regular intervals, but nothing 
between meals. The largest meal should be given 
at the middle of the day, and a light supper at 
least a half-hour before bed-time. Milk may be 
given once between meals. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, 
eggs, beefsteak, mutton chops, roast lamb, and 
chicken; baked, boiled, or steamed vegetables; 
sponge cakes and lady-fingers (if not fresh) ; fruits, 
custards. Junkets, rice pudding, tapioca, or gela- 
tine; milk, water, and cocoa. 

The following foods should not be given to 
children: Dried or salted meat or fish; raw vege- 
tables; fried foods; fresh or hot breads; rich cakes, 
pastry, and rich preserves; tea, coffee, or alcoholic 
drinks. 

It is not wise to wait until a child grows up before

teaching him good table manners. Children 
should not sit sidewise or on the edge of the chair. 
They should not put their elbows on the table. 
Warn them not to drink until they have swallowed 
the food that they may be eating. Do not let them 
lean their glasses over their nose while they are 
drinking. Teach them to eat solid food with a 
fork, taking only small portions at one time. 
Soup should be eaten quietly from the side of the 
spoon and it should be dipped away from rather 
than toward the person who is eating. Do not 
allow a child to tip dishes in order to get the last 
bit of food. When taking food from a dish in 
which it is served, the utensils supplied for that 
purpose should be used and not the child's knife, 
fork, or spoon. Children should not be allowed 
to reach across the table for food nor to reach in 
front of another person. When not in use, the 
knife and fork should be laid along the side of the 
plate and the spoon should be on the side of the 
saucer. Children should be cautioned against 
speaking when their mouths are full, keeping their 
mouths open when they are eating, or smacking 
their lips. They should not be allowed to monop- 
olize the conversation at the table but reasonable 
questions should be answered and they should 
be encouraged to contribute to the general conver- 
sation. There should be no such thing as "com-

pany manners." Careless or greedy habits should 
be checked as they appear. The problem is an 
easy one if parents are careful to observe the rules 
of good manners themselves, for children will 
become polite by imitation.

LESSON XIV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR SCHOOL 

The diet of a child is always important, as it 
determines to a large extent the physical condition 
in later Ufe. All though school life, a constant 
supervision of the food of a child is necessary. 
Digestion and assimilation are very active; all 
parts of the body are increasing in size; the muscles 
are trained to more coordinated activity; and 
the nervous system is constantly receiving and 
storing new impressions. The body requires suffi- 
cient food of the right kind to nourish it and to 
stimulate its activities. Investigations prove 
that many so-called backward children are dull 
because of the lack of proper nourishment. 

To keep up these body functions, to repair 
wastes of the body, and to aid in the development 
of new tissues, it is necessary to furnish liberal 
and well planned meals so arranged that they 
supply the needed mineral matters and growth- 
stimulating substances as well as protein and 
energy. Care must be taken to furnish variety 
in the food, for children in this period of unrest 
tire of a monotonous diet. Some foods may be 
chosen for flavor alone. 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL lOI 

Frequently children are interested in their play 
or other activities at meal time and their bodies 
are not in proper condition to take care of the 
food eaten. SuflGicient time should be required 
to prepare for meals. A child should be required 
to wash his hands and face and comb his hair 
before coming to the table. He should keep his 
mouth clean and his teeth in good condition. 
After meals children should not play or work hard 
until sufl&cient time has been taken for the diges- 
tion of the food. To hurry to school with no 
breakfast or an insuflScient amount and kind, 
causes hunger and fatigue during the morning and 
poor work in lessons. Children should be re- 
quired to take a full breakfast, consisting of fruit, 
fresh or stewed; well cooked cereal, served with 
milk or cream and a little sugar; some toast or 
day-old bread; and a drink of hot milk or cocoa. 
If the child will eat more, soft-cooked eggs may 
be added. 

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 

There is no time in the whole Uf e history of the 
individual during which there is more urgent need 
of the materials required to build up the red blood 
cells than between the ages of twelve and sixteen. 
During this period the foundation of physical 
efficiency is laid, and the normal healthy boy or 



I02 HOME DIETETICS 

girl will usually require almost as much food as 
an adult. 

At this age children develop abnormal appetites 
or notions about their food, and usually more 
attention must be given to flavors, attractiveness, 
and variety. As iron is a necessity for the de- 
velopment of the red blood cells, some of the foods 
containing high percentages of iron, such as beef, 
eggs, raisins, prunes, beans, peas, lentils, or green 
vegetables, especially spinach, asparagus, cabbage, 
lettuce, and celery, should be used in the diet 
daily. 

To further the physical development of the 
child, besides supplying an abundance of non- 
stimulating food, it is necessary to watch care- 
fully the hygienic condition. The child should 
be trained in regular habits of life, should have 
plenty of out-of-door exercise and an abundance 
of sleep — from nine to ten hours daily. 

The Lunch Box. — ^When the child begins school 
his daily life is radically changed, and the food 
requirements of the body are greatly increased to 
meet the many new demands on the body. There 
is great need of a lunch in the middle of the session. 
In many schools a recess is given and lunches may 
be eaten. In some schools lunches are furnished 
by the school for a small siun.^ Children should 
be encouraged to bring lunches from home or 



POOD FOR SCHOOL 103 

should be supplied with money to buy a lunch at 
school. 

Often the school is situated a long distance from 
home and the child is not able to go home for the 
mid-day meal. Such conditions require the child 
to carry enough lunch for the whole day, and the 
lunch box needs special attention. 

The box itself is of utmost importance, for the 
food must remain in it several hours. A metal 
box is most desirable as it can be easily sterilized. 
The collapsible type is most convenient to carry 
home when emptied. 

To have a lunch palatable after it has been 
packed several hours requires great care. Each 
article of food should be wrapped, separately in 
paraffine paper, which keeps the food from drying 
out. The smaU packages should then be packed 
closely but neatly. The appearance of the lunch 
box should be made as dainty and attractive as 
possible. Napkins, either paper or linen, should 
be included. 

Sandwiches usually form the main part of the 
lunch and can be prepared in attractive shapes 
from many different materials. The bread may 
be white, whole wheat, graham, oatmeal, or nut, 
and should be cut thin, about one-fourth inch thick. 
Choice may be made from a variety of fiUings such 
as meats, fish, and eggs with or without a salad 
dressing; cheese, jellies, and peanut butter. 



I04 HOME DIETETICS 

Something sweet should be included such as 
cakes, cookies, candies, dates, figs or raisins, and 
some relish such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery, 
or fresh fruit. If this can be supplemented with 
a cup of cocoa or a bowl of soup the child need 
not suffer as a result of carrying lunches to school. 

The lunch time at school should be as pleasant 
a meal time as any other, and good habits in 
eating as well as good manners should be developed.

LESSON XV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR THE SICK 

An invalid is a person disabled by infirmities 
or disease. As each case has a special cause or 
causes, each must be Considered separately and 
a special diet planned. In each case the person 
will benefit greatly by proper dietetic and hygienic 
treatment. 

In hospitals and among nurses and physicians 
diets ior invalids are usually classified as liquid, 
soft^oUd, and special. Liquid diets include railk, 
broths, beef juice, beef tea, cocoa, fruit beverages, 
barley and rice waters, gruel, and cream soups. 
In soft diets are found soft-cooked eggs, milk 
toast, custards, jellies, junkets, ice creams, and 
ices. The solid diet includes simple foods con- 
taining soUd parts, such as cereals, vegetables, 
meats, fruits, desserts (except pastry and rich 
cakes), and eggs in all forms except hard-boiled. 
Special diets are usually planned with particular 
reference to the peculiar condition of the patient 
and are especially prescribed by the physician. 

In preparing dietaries for invalids only a few 
general directions can be given, as each person 
needs certain foods, depending upon the disease, 
107 



Io8 HOME DIETETICS 

the constitution, surroundings, etc. The doctor 
should prescribe the diet the patient may have, 
and the nurse must follow his directions to the 
letter, giving the food in the proper quantities 
and at regular intervals. It is unwise to consult 
a patient about his food if he is on a diet. If a 
patient asks for some special food, always consult 
the doctor about it before giving it to the patient. 

Before serving an invalid bathe face and hands, 
adjust pillows, and fix him in as comfortable a 
position as possible. If a regular invalid table is 
not available, a pile of books or magazines on each 
side of the patient's knees will serve as supports 
for the tray, or a table may easily be prepared 
from a wooden soap box by removing the sides 
and top. The ends wiU form the table legs and 
the bottom the table top. 

Great care must be exercised in preparing the 
tray. It should be of a convenient size to ac- 
commodate the menu, and should be covered with 
a clean white cloth. 

The dishes should be the most attractive avail- 
able and should be arranged in an artistic but a 
simple form. A flower adds to the appearance of 
the tray and may please the invalid. Or, a little 
surprise in the nature of a gift or a letter or a note 
from a friend may distract his attention so that while 
enjoying these he unconsciously enjoys his meal 



FOOD FOR THE SICK lOQ 

or takes the nourishment without pajdng much 
attention to it. 

In serving a patient, it is wise not to serve too 
many things at one time and always to serve in 
small qu^tities, for the patient will try to eat 
all of a smaU serving, while a generous serving 
may take away what little appetite he has. 
Be sure of the seasonings and temperature of the 
food and always serve hot foods hot and cold 
foods cold. When the diet is limited vary it as 
much as possible in preparation and serving. 

After the meal, the tray and all traces of the 
meal should be removed. 

If the patient's appetite is poor it may some- 
-times be stimulated by giving fruit beverages, 
beef tea, and oysters. These in themselves have 
but little food value but tend to increase the 
flow of the digestive juices, and these in turn create 
a desire for food. 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked and 
toast should be crisp all through, not just browned 
on the outside. It may be softened with hot milk 
or water. 

MUk and eggs form the main articles in an in- 
valid's diet, and can be served in a variety of ways. 
Gelatines and ices furnish an attractive means of 
serving liquid foods in solid forms, and cream 
soups add variety to milk diet. 



no HOME DIETETICS 

Constipation, which is very common and which 
is frequently the source of many diseases, results 
from such causes as carelessness in attention to 
bodily functions at the proper time, lack of exer- 
cise, too little water, lack of bulk in food, lack of 
the natural laxative salts and acids of vegetables 
and fruits, improper habits in eating, or the use 
of indigestible foods. When constipation seems 
due to other than such causes a physician should 
always be consulted. 

Foods which in themselves are laxative are 
commonly of much benefit. The following are 
generally believed to aid greatly in relieving the 
trouble: oranges, lemons, grapefruit, apples, 
prunes, figs, asparagus and other green vegetables, 
molasses, honey, olive oil, butter, cream, oatmeal, 
whole-grain breads, bran biscuit, and buttermilk. 

Another common disease which needs dietetic 
and hygienic rather than medical treatment, is 
anemia. This disease results in an insufl&cient 
supply of red blood cells. It is often caused by 
improper diet, especially one lacking in foods 
containing iron; intestinal or other parasites; 
improper ventilation and clothing; lack of outdoor 
exercise; and an insufl&cient amount of sleep. 
In such cases a cure may be brought about by the 
use of plenty of well-cooked cereals, milk, eggs, 
simple foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. 



FOOD rOR THE SICK III 

and regtilar meals. It is better to take five light 
meals a day than three heavy meals. More seri- 
ous anemia is also known, so a physician's advice 
should be sought when anemia occurs.

INTRODUCTION 

This book is designed for general use in classes 
to be taught under the supervision of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross Nursing Service. The aim of the 
course is to give in a simple way the underlying 
principles of cookery. These are presented in 
fifteen lessons. There are also directions for four- 
teen lessons in practical cookery. For conven- 
ience a lesson in theory will usually be followed by 
one in practical cookery. For this reason one of 
each series of lessons is placed in each chapter of 
the book, in spite of the fact that this disturbs 
somewhat the logical arrangement of the subject- 
matter. 

The individual recipes are given for convenience 
in laboratory work. They may also be used if 
the teaching is done by the demonstration method 
unless it is desirable to prepare sufficient food to 
serve the class and then the home recipe may be 
used. Where meals are to be prepared, the home 
recipes are to be used and it will be convenient 
to have the pupils work in groups. Lack of time 
will often prevent the preparation of all the foods 
suggested in the practical lessons. 



VI INTRODUCTION 

The equipment needed will depend upon 
whether the demonstration method of instruction 
or individual laboratory practice is adopted. In 
general, only cooking utensils are needed. 

The references given at the close of each lesson 
are confined to U. S. Government publications 
which can be obtained either free or at a nominal 
price. In cases where no price is given single 
copies may be obtained (as long as the supply 
lasts) by application to the Department from which 
they are published. If several copies of the same 
publication are desired for class use, the request 
should be made through a Member, of Congress. 
When a price is mentioned, the publication may be 
purchased for that sum from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washing- 
ton, D. C; remittances should be by coupons, 
postal money order, express order, or New York 
draft. 

To individual authors I may owe debts of which 
I am not aware, for my knowledge is an accumu- 
lation of material from various sources. The 
thoughts gleaned here and there have been inter- 
woven with my experience until a separation of 
that which belongs to others and that which is 
really my own seems impossible. I recognize 
clearly, though, that much of the best of my 



INTRODUCTION Vll 

material is the result of investigations made by the 
United States Government, particularly the 
Department of Agriculture. 

I wish to recognize here assistance which has 
been given me in preparing the work, by Anna G. 
Wetzel, teacher of dietetics, William Penn High 
School. Zeta B. Cundey, teacher of English, 
William Penn High School, has given me helpful 
criticism during the preparation of the manu- 
script. Dr. W. C. Rucker, Assistant Surgeon Gen- 
eral, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C., 
was kind enough to read and make useful sugges- 
tions for the last three lessons. To Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, Miss E. L. Hunt, and Miss H. W. 
Atwater, of the Office of Home Economics of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, I gratefully 
acknowledge my obligations for many suggestions 
and for very valuable constructive criticism.

HOME DIETETICS 

LESSON I— SECTION A 
HYGIENE OF FOOD 

" Cleanliness is a most important consideration in cook- 
ing, for food materials may be the means of transmitting 
disease. True cleanliness must take into account free- 
dom not only from what we know as "dirt" but also the 
micro-organisms which commonly accompany filth and 
dirt." 

In the world about us are hundreds of forms of 
bacteria which are invisible to the naked eye. 
They thrive best where uncleanly conditions exist. 
Decaying animal and vegetable matter is espe- 
cially conducive to their growth. Some of these 
forms are of great value to man but others are a 
menace to a healthy body. 

Flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are germ 
carriers and they should be carefully excluded 
from homes. Rats and even dogs and cats may 
spread disease. Danger also exists where dust 
collects for it may be laden with harmful forms of 
bacteria. Clean houses, clean clothing, clean 



2 HOME DIETETICS 

bodies, and clean food are then of the utmost 
importance. 

The person who prepares food should wear 
clean clothing, simple in style, which can be 
easily laundered. Woolen dresses or "cast off" 
finery are entirely out o'f place in the kitchen. 
The body should be kept clean by frequent baths, 
the hair should be neatly combed, and the nose 
and mouth should be kept in good condition. 
Special attention should be given to the hands. 
They should always be washed before handling 
food • and especially after having been to the 
toilet. It is quite possible that harmful colon 
bacteria may be on the hands from just opening 
and shutting the door of the toilet. The finger 
nails should be free from dirt. Never dip any- 
thing but a clean spoon into food when tasting it. 

The dishes in which food is placed or served 
should be clean. After use they should be care- 
fully scraped and piled in an orderly manner. 
Two pans of water are necessary for washing 
dishes; one with hot, soapy water, to remove the 
grease, and the other with boiling water for rinsing. 
Remember that high heat kills germs. It is far 
better to dry dishes by allowing the water to 
drain off from them than to wipe them on dirty 
towels. If they must be drained in a dusty place, 
they should be covered. Dish towels and dish 



HYGIENE OF FOOD 3 

cloths should be kept clean. Wash and rinse 
them each time after using. Frequent scalding 
is also necessary. It is better to wash the glass 
first, then the silver, and finally the china. 

Food should not be exposed to dust either in 
the home or in the market. Housekeepers should 
refuse to buy unwrapped bread, or other food 
that has been unnecessarily exposed. Wash fruit 
thoroughly before it is used. Loathsome dis- 
eases have been contracted from eating fruit 
handled carelessly or by diseased persons. Flour, 
sugar, and other foods that come in bags should be 
emptied into receptacles with tight covers. Re- 
move fresh meat from the wrapping paper, wipe 
with a clean, damp cloth, and set near the ice or 
in the safe in the cellar. Milk should be kept in 
a closed vessel and in a cool place. The outside 
of the milk bottle should be washed before the 
bottle is opened. Butter, if purchased in wooden 
trays, should be removed inmmediately to a 
covered vessel. Frequently scald and air re- 
ceptacles in which food is kept. Sunshine kills 
germs. 

A refrigerator or a screened safe in a cellar for 
storing food should receive careful attention. 
Bits of food spilled on the shelves invite bacterial 
growth. Clean often with scalding water and 
washing soda or some other good cleaning material. 



4 HOME DIETETICS 

Keep a strainer in the sink to prevent particles 
of food from obstructing the drainage. This 
should be emptied into the garbage can after the 
dishes are scraped. Wash and rinse the strainer 
and hang it above the sink. After the dish wash- 
ing is finished, wash every part of the sink with 
soap and hot water and use a strong solution of 
washing soda at least once a week. 

Thoroughly clean and scald the garbage pail 
after it is emptied. Unless a local law prevents, 
line the garbage can with old newspapers before 
it is used again. Always keep the can tightly 
covered when in use.

LESSON II.— SECTION A 
NUTRIENTS 

The problem of nutrition is one of growing im- 
portance, not only because of the increased cost 
of food but because more and more we are coming 
to realize that a healthy body is man's greatest 
asset. 

Food is technically defined as anything which, 
when taken into the body, is capable of building 
or repairing tissue or furnishing energy. The 
energy is used for performing internal muscular 
work, as the beating of the heart, and external 
muscular work, as chopping wood, walking, or 
playing ball. 

Our bodies are wonderful pieces of machinery, 
far more wonderful than anything man has made. 
A variety of foods is needed to keep their intricate 
parts in normal condition. Nature, through our 
instincts, has guided us to some extent in the choice 
of foods. Her dictates were the starting point of 
our understanding of the facts about food and 
nutrition. They laid the foundation of a science 
which is rapidly developing as the result of careful 
and painstaking laboratory studies. 

5 



6 HOME DIETETICS 

The scientist has classified the substances which 
make up our foods, or the nutrients, under five 
heads: water, mineral matters (ash), protein, car- 
bohydrates, and fats. 

Water ranks as food because it enters into the 
composition of every tissue, even bones and teeth. 
It regulates the body temperature and has a part 
to play in all nervous and muscular work. It has 
been estimated that two-thirds of the material in 
the human body is water, and since water is con- 
tinually passing off from the body there must be 
a constant supply of it. Our foods as they are 
prepared for the table are about one-half water. 
They supply part but not all of the water needed, 
and must therefore be supplemented by drinking 
water. Since water is known to be capable of 
carrying diseases the greatest care should be taken 
to keep the supply pure. 

Mineral substances play an important part in 
building the body and in its chemical reactions. 
There are many kinds used by the system. 
Among the most important are calcium (lime) 
salts, which are needed for bone formation. They 
are found abundantly in milk, eggs, cereals, and 
vegetables. Children need a considerable amount 
of calcium salts and for this reason special atten- 
tion should be given to them in the diet. Lack 
of calcium may show itself in the form of an ab- 



NUTRIENTS 7 

normal appetite for such substances as plaster, 
wood, or chalk, or in poor teeth. 

Iron is very important, for its presence in the 
hemoglobin of the blood makes oxygen-carrying 
possible. Iron salts are found in nearly all foods, 
but especially in beef, eggs, oatmeal and some of 
the green vegetables. 

Common salt (sodium chlorid) occurs in every 
tissue of the body except the enamel of the teeth, 
so it is important in our food. There are many 
other necessary mineral constituents, such as com- 
pounds of magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus, etc., 
and fortunately these are found in many of our 
staple foods. 

Protein supplies nitrogen for tissue building. 
All people, old and young, need it to repair tissue 
waste. The growing child, however, needs it not 
only to repair waste but also for growth. There 
are several forms of protein, varying in composi- 
tion. It is probable that the different proteins 
supply nitrogen in forms suited to different bodily 
needs, but this subject is still a matter for discus- 
sion and investigation. Safety would therefore 
seem to lie in the habitual use of a number of dif- 
ferent kinds of protein, which explains perhaps 
the general tendency of man toward a mixed diet. 
We may obtain it from the animal and also from 
the vegetable kingdom, from milk, eggs, fish and 



5 HOME DIETETICS 

meat, and also from cereals, legumes and nuts. 
Protein not only supplies nitrogen for tissue build- 
ing but may also be used as a source of energy. 
It is drawn upon for this purpose more largely if 
fats, starches, and sugars are limited in the diet. 

The carbohydrates (starch, sugar, cellulose, 
etc.) can not supply nitrogen and so can not re- 
place the nitrogen of protein as a building material, 
but they can spare it as a source of energy. Car- 
bohydrates are obtained mainly from the vegetable 
kingdom. 

Starch is manufactured by growing plants and 
stored up in the form of tiny grains lying within 
the plant cells. We obtain the greater part of 
the starch of our diet from cereals and potatoes. 

Sugars, except lactose or milk sugar, are ob- 
tained from the vegetable kingdom. By far the 
most abundant kind in our diet is sucrose, which 
is obtained chiefly from the sugar cane, the sor- 
ghum, and the beet. 

Fats, like carbohydrates, are incapable of re- 
placing protein as a source of nitrogen for body 
building and repair. They serve as a source of 
heat and energy and have an energy value, per 
pound, 2)^ times that of protein or carbohydrates. 
We obtain them chiefly from meat, milk, eggs, and 
butter in the animal kingdom and from nuts, choc- 
olate, and olives in the vegetable kingdom. 



NUTRIENTS 9 

The body uses food as fuel, just as the engine 
uses coal. The unit for measuring energy is the 
calorie and the fuel value of our various food mate- 
rials is therefore expressed in this term. It should 
be remembered, however, that the fuel value of 
a food is not its only value, for the body requires 
protein to supply nitrogen to build and repair tis- 
sue. It is important, therefore, to know of a given 
food not only its total fuel value but also what 
part of the fuel is in the form of protein.

LESSON III— SECTION A 

MEAT AND FISH 

Meat, and the term is used here to include 
poultry as well as beef, mutton, and so on, is an 
important and a very generally used source of 
protein. An ordinary serving of meat once a 
day (or a like amount divided between two or all 
three meals) is a reasonable quantity, but it does 
not follow that more is harmful. Too much meat 
in the diet, however, is not economical, since it is 
seldom a cheap source of energy, and many be- 
lieve that a large amount of meat protein imposes 
a needless tax on the digestive and excretory 
organs and may be an important contributing 
cause to intestinal putrefaction. A part of the 
supply of protein should be obtained from milk, 
eggs, legumes, etc. 

The lean portion of meat is composed of bundles 
of fibers held together by connective tissue. Al- 
bumin and gelatin are the principal proteins found 
in meat and they should always be considered 
when it is being prepared for food. Albumin is 
hardened by intense heat and gelatin is obtained 
from the connective tissue by long, slow applica- 
tion of heat, with moisture. 



MEAT AND FISH 1 3 

"Results of experiments show that there is no marked 
difference in ease of digestion of various kinds and cuts of 
meat. Over 95 per cent, of the proteins and fat is digested ; 
which means that the nutrients of meat are largely used 
by the body with little waste. Therefore, those who wish 
to use the cheaper cuts of meat need not fear that in so 
doing their families will be less well nourished than by 
the use of more expensive cuts." C. F. Langworthy. 

As it occurs in our food the protein from meat 
is more readily digested and absorbed than the 
vegetable protein and there is reason to believe 
that it is more valuable to the body, since it is 
more like body protein in structure and so more 
readily used. 

When a muscle is exercised vigorously the con- 
nective tissue increases in amount and becomes 
hardened and the muscle is consequently hardened 
or toughened and the amount of extractives (sub- 
stances which give flavor) increased. Tough 
meats, as a rule, therefore, contain more flavor 
than the other meats. There are many good ways 
of making palatable dishes from them. The cuts 
of tough meat are usually less expensive and their 
use is economical, especially when the flavors are 
to be drawn out, as in soups and stews. The 
shank and chuck are examples of tough cuts. 

The muscles that are exercised slightly have 
softer and often more fat connective tissue and so 
are more tender. These meats make the tender 



14 



HOME DIETETICS 



cuts, such as the tenderloin and sirloin of beef. 
They are the most expensive parts of meat and are 
commonly used for roasting and broiling, rather 
than for the long, slow cooking desirable for 
tougher cuts. 

Some muscles have a moderate amount of exer- 
cise and lie near the muscles which are exercised 
more vigorously. They have tender fibers and a 
fair proportion of juice, and may well be used for 
boiling and roasting. The top of the round and 
the rump are illustrations.

USES OF CUTS OF BEEF 



The chuck is excellent for stews. It makes a 
very good roast and is sometimes sold as steaks. 

The ribs are sold for roasts, being cut into one, 
two, and three-rib pieces. 

The loin includes the porterhouse, sirloin, and 
tenderloin steaks. They are the choicest and 
highest priced cuts in beef. 

The rump contains the end of the hip bone and 
the joint. The fleshy part makes very good steaks 
and roasts. 

The round consists of a very juicy, lean muscle 
and contains but little bone. It is sold for roasts, 
steaks, beef tea, and beef juice. 

The shanks are cut from the fore and the hind 
legs. They are tough and contain bones and ten- 
dons. They are used for soups and stews. 

The flank is boneless and coarse-grained but 
good in flavor. It makes a good rolled roast, or 
it may be used for stews. 

The navel and clod are used for soups and stews. 

The brisket makes a good pot roast; or it may 
be used for soups and stews. 

Fish. — Fish is an important source of protein 
and may be used in the diet very much as meat 
is. It often contains less fat than meat and so 
has a lower fuel value, pound for pound. As a 



1 6 HOME DIETETICS 

source of fuel, therefore, lean fish, such as cod, 
might seem less economical even at a lower price 
than such cuts of beef as sirloin steak; but as a 
source of protein (the most expensive nutrient) it 
is much cheaper. The common practice of cook- 
ing fish with fat tends to compensate for its low 
fuel value. 

The different kinds of fresh fish are best at their 
peculiar seasons. Out of season they are inferior 
in flavor and have a disagreeable odor. In choos- 
ing fish, avoid those with dull eyes, pale red gills, 
and dry or easily-loosened scales. If the flesh is 
so soft when pressed with a finger, that the inden- 
tation remains, it is unfit for use. 

Fish is often preserved by salting, smoking, or 
pickling. In these forms it can frequently be ob- 
tained more cheaply than fresh. When dried dur- 
ing the preserving process the nutrients become 
more concentrated, so that even at the same price 
per pound a given sum would buy more nutrients 
than if spent for fresh fish. Although dried fish 
is perhaps not to be recommended for very young 
children, there is no reason to suppose that when 
properly prepared it is not perfectly wholesome 
for normal adults. Good canned fish also offers 
a convenient and economical substitute for fresh 
fish or for meat. 



LESSON III— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF MEATS 

Fresh meat is firm to the touch and bright in 
color, red in the case of beef and mutton and red- 
dish pink in the case of pork and veal. The fat 
should be dry enough to crumble easily, and, in 
the case of beef, should be of a yellow color. The 
best beef is marbled with narrow lines of fat. 
When received from the market, meat should be 
taken from the paper and wiped thoroughly with a 
damp cloth. It should be covered and put in a 
a cool place. 

Tender meats should be cooked in their own 
juices to preserve the flavor. The juice may be 
kept in by hardening the albumin on the outside 
by means of high heat, as is the case when a broiled 
steak is put near the hot coals or a roast into a 
very hot oven. The temperature should then be 
lowered. There are three general ways of cooking 
tender meats: over hot coals, or broiling; pan 
broiling, or sauteing; and roasting. Less com- 
monly tender meat (veal cutlet or chicken, for 
example,) is fried, either plain or crumbed, in deep 
fat. 

17 



1 8 HOME DIETETICS 

METHODS OF COOKING TENDER MEATS 

Broiling. — Place the meat on a greased broiler 
over hot coals or under the gas flame. Quickly 
sear over both sides to retain the juices; continue 
to turn often. Steak i inch thick will be cooked 
rare in 5 minutes, and well done in 6 minutes. 
There is a difference of opinion as to the best time 
to season broiled meat. If the seasonings are 
added before the broiling they penetrate the meat 
more thoroughly, but, on the other hand, the salt 
tends to draw out the juices. It is therefore better 
to add the seasonings at the end, to prevent waste 
of material. 

Pan Broiling. — Have the frying pan very hot 
and then grease it over with a small amount of 
fat. Bits of suet may be used for this purpose. 
Sear the meat over on both sides; then cook more 
slowly, turning the meat often. When sufficiently 
cooked, remove to a hot platter and serve. 

A thick brown sauce or gravy may be made by 
stirring flour smoothly into the fat in the pan and 
then gradually adding hot water, stirring all the 
time. The method and proportions are the same 
as used in making white sauce. (See p. 52.) 

Roasting. — Season the meat and dredge with 
flour. The starch grains of the flour under the 
influence of heat will form a pasty covering which 



COOKERY OF MEATS 19 

will aid in retaining the juices of the meat. Place 
uncovered on the grate in the oven of a coal range 
or in a hot gas range, and sear over, turning with 
a fork until the searing is complete. Then pour 
in at the side enough hot water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan and place the pan on the bottom 
of the oven, if a coal range is used. The meat 
should be frequently basted. A covered roasting 
pan is very desirable. The water is then poured 
into the lower pan after the meat is seared over 
and the cover put on. Basting is then unneces- 
sary, as the steam will keep the meat moist. 
Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat and, 
if the roast is more than 4 pounds, fifteen minutes 
more for the heat to penetrate. Brown sauce may 
be made in the pan after the roast is removed. 

METHODS OF COOKING TOUGH MEATS 

The principle followed in cooking tough meats 
is to cook slowly at not too high a temperature 
keeping the meat moist. Pot roasting, stewing 
and casserole cooking are examples. 

Pot Roast. — Tough cuts are used for pot roasts. 
The meat should be put into boiling water and 
boiled for ten minutes until the albumin is hard- 
ened on the outside, to retain the juices. Season- 
ings should then be added and the meat cooked 



20 HOME DIETETICS 

slowly until it is tender. The latter process can 
be carried out very successfully in a tireless cooker. 
If desired, the roast may be browned in the kettle 
by letting the water simmer away. When the 
roast is removed a brown sauce may be made in 
the regular way. If the meat is removed before 
browning and a sauce made in which the roast is 
cooked, it is necessary to stir the flour until free 
from lumps in a small portion of water before 
adding it. 

Soup. — If soup is desired the meat should be 
placed in cold water and brought to the simmering 
point. Cook slowly until the fibers fall apart 
and seem tasteless. A good order for soup stock 
consists of four pounds of soup meat beef; one 
knuckle of veal, well broken; and one pound of 
marrow bone. In ordering any kind of meat ask 
that the trimmings and bones be sent, as they may 
be used to replenish the soup stock. 

Stewed Meats. — In stewing meats we have a 
two-fold purpose; that is, to keep part of the 
juices in to retain the flavor of the meat, and to 
extract part of the juices to flavor the gravy. 
This may be accomplished by putting the meat into 
cold water and quickly bringing it to the boiling 
point. It should then be cooked slowly until 
tender.

LESSON IV— SECTION A 

MILK AND EGGS 

Milk and eggs are extremely important foods, 
particularly in the diet of the young and of in- 
valids. Eggs contain only a trace of carbohy- 
drate. Milk contains milk sugar but no starch. 
In general, neither needs cooking except to make 
it more palatable, and in the case of milk, to lessen 
the danger from harmful bacteria. As eggs and 
milk, like meat, contain much protein as com- 
pared with other nutrients, cooking at a low tem- 
perature is desirable so that they may be soft and 
under, rather than over-cooked. 

Great care should be used in handling milk. 
We should demand that it be forwarded and 
delivered to us in a sanitary condition. The 
milk bottle should be carefully washed before the 
cover is removed. The milk may be left in the 
bottle until used, or, if preferred, poured into a 
freshly scalded and covered vessel. It should be 
set in a cool, clean place, free from dirt, flies, etc. 
If left at a temperature of 50 F. or less, good milk 
should remain sweet for twenty-four hours or 
more. 

24 



MILK AND EGGS 25 

Much of the milk sold by dealers is pasteurized. 
This is to be distinguished from sterilized milk. 
Pasteurization is accomplished by bringing milk 
to a temperature of 6o° to 65 C. (140 to 149 F.) 
and holding it there for twenty minutes. Steril- 
izing milk means boiling it for a certain length of 
time or heating it nearly to the boiling point, allow- 
ing it to stand for some hours, and again heating 
it, repeating the operation several times. Boiled 
milk is very difficult for children to digest. Pas- 
teurized milk is preferable to boiled milk for this 
reason. It should not be necessary to depend on 
sterilizing or pasteurizing as a means of providing 
germ-free milk. The milk should be produced 
under clean conditions, even if it is to be pas- 
seurized. Where there is any doubt as to the 
tanitary quality of the milk, it should be pasteur- 
ized. Pasteurized milk is much better for chil- 
dren than raw milk of questionable quality. It 
is the opinion of many authorities that babies fed 
on pasteurized milk thrive fully as well as those 
fed on raw milk. 

Eggs spoil because of the action of bacteria 
which are either included in them before they are 
laid, or, less often, enter later through the pores 
of the shell. Eggs should be kept in a cool, clean 
placed 

During the season when eggs are plentiful it is 



26 HOME DIETETICS 

economical to buy a supply and preserve them. 
The best method of preservation is by the use of 
water glass, which may be obtained at a drug 
store and diluted with water in the proportion of 
one part of water glass to five parts of pure water. 
Place the eggs in a clean stone jar and pour in the 
solution, leaving two inches of the liquid covering 
the top layer of eggs, and set in a cold place. 

Only clean, fresh eggs should be preserved. A 
good, fresh egg has a rough, dull shell and should 
not be smooth and shiny. If you are in doubt as 
to the freshness of eggs, candle them or see whether 
they sink when placed in a dish of fresh water. 
If an egg sinks it is reasonably fresh.

LESSON V— SECTION A 
CEREALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 

The cereals represent a fairly complete food, 
that is, one in which all the food principles are 
represented in good proportions. They are grown 
in all parts of the world except the arctic regions 
and therefore form staple foods of all countries. 
They are widely grown, easily stored in good con- 
dition, usable in many ways, may be readily 
prepared for the table, and are palatable and 
digestible. 

A study of the table shows that the cereals vary 
as to the proportion of nutrients but that carbo- 
hydrates predominate in all grains. The carbo- 
hydrates are mainly in the form of starch and this 
determines the general method of cereal cookery. 
The starch grains are stored up in cells whose 
walls are a tough cellulose. High temperature and 
long continued cooking are necessary to break down 
the cell walls and to free the starch grains so that 
they may be acted upon by the digestive juices. 

The cereals are prepared for the table in a great 
variety of ways. Wheat, corn, and rye are the 

31 



32 CEREALS — GENERAL DISCUSSION 

grains which are most frequently ground into flour 
and used for breads. Buckwheat is used for 
griddle cakes. Served with gravy or butter and 
syrup, buckwheat cakes are high in energy value. 
Rice is a valuable food and may well be used fre- 
quently as a vegetable or prepared as a dessert. 
Among the cereals used for breakfast foods, oats 
are very valuable. Oatmeal is not only highly 
nutritious but it gives bulk which is necessary for 
digestion and excretion. 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixtures are divided into two chief 
classes — batters and doughs. Each class may be 
subdivided. A batter may be made of one part 
liquid to one part of flour, and is then termed a 
thin batter; or, it may be made in the proportion 
of one part of liquid to two parts of flour and then 
forms a thick batter. A dough made in the pro- 
portion of one part liquid to three of flour is called 
a soft dough; and if the proportion is one part 
liquid to more than three of flour, it is then a stiff 
dough. Griddle cakes, popovers, and ginger 
bread are types of thin batter. Cakes come under 
the head of thick batters, and the proportions 
should be kept in mind when a new recipe is being 
considered. The breads and pastry come under 



HOME DIETETICS 33 

the soft doughs, while cookies and crullers are 
stiff dough. 

Flour mixtures are raised or made light by means 
of leavens. The leavens most commonly used in 
bread making and for similar purposes are steam, 
air, and carbon di-oxide. The carbon di-oxide 
may be due to the growth of yeast or to the action 
of chemicals such as cooking soda and cream of 
tartar. The desired results are brought about 
by the action of definite physical laws, namely: 
that water converted into steam produces a force 
which tends to expand a mixture enclosing it, and 
that air or gas (carbon di-oxide), also expands 
when heated, producing a similar result. The 
flour is sifted and the egg is beaten to catch and 
hold the tiny quantities of air which may expand 
and make the mixture light, under the influence 
of heat during cooking. 

In using recipes for flour mixtures, remember 
that flour should always be sifted before measuring 
and that measurements should always be accurate, 
a knife being used to level off the flour at the top of 
the measuring cup or the baking powder in the tea 
spoon. If care is used there is no such thing as 
"luck" in baking; the results are always the same 
if the conditions are always the same.

LESSON V— SECTION B 
MAKING OF CAKE AND PASTRY 

CAKE MAKING 

All cakes may be classified under one of two 
headings; that is, they either contain fat and are 
then called butter cakes, or they do not contain 
fat, and are then called sponge cakes. The general 
method of handling each type is illustrated by the 
"plain cake" and the "hot water sponge cake." 
If a butter cake of very fine quality is desired, 
separate the egg, using only the beaten yolk at 
first, then fold in the beaten white just before the 
mixture is poured into the baking pan. 

GENERAL RULES FOR BAKING 

In baking, divide the time into quarters. First 
quarter, mixture should begin to rise. 

Second quarter, mixture continues rising and 
begins to brown. 

Third quarter, mixture continues browning. 

Fourth quarter, mixture finishes baking and 
shrinks from pan. 

35 



36 HOME DIETETICS 

Cake should often be looked at during the bak- 
ing. If the oven door is opened and closed care- 
fully there is no danger of the cake falling. 

Cake should not be moved in the oven until it 
is fully risen. After this time it may be moved 
so that it will brown evenly. 

Cake, when done, shrinks from the pan and does 
not retain indentation if pressed with the finger. 
It is wise to test with a small toothpick. If the 
toothpick comes out clean the cake is thoroughly 
done. 

Cake will crack if too much flour has been used, 
or if the oven is too hot.

PASTRY 

The use of pastry and its ease of digestion is a 
subject concerning which there is much disagree- 
ment. In general, it may be said that a tender, 
rich pastry is just as fully digested as many more 
simple foods, but a tough or "soggy" pastry may 
prove difficult of digestion. In the case of any 
digestive disorders, especially intestinal, it is wiser 
to omit pastry from the diet. 

Pastry consists of fat and starch which makes it 
a very concentrated food. It should therefore be 
considered as a substantial food rather than as a 
delicacy to be added to an already sufficient meal. 
More trouble comes from overeating, when pie is 
used as a dessert at a hearty meal, than from the 
indigestibility of the pastry itself. 



38 HOME DIETETICS 

The air incorporated in the mixture and the 
steam generated from the water used, are the 
leavens which make pastry light. It is necessary- 
then to sift the flour, to cut in the fat, and to 
handle the dough lightly so that as much air as 
possible may become entangled in the mixture. 
If properly handled, a light, flaky product should 
always result.

LESSON VI— SECTION A 
CEREALS— BREAD MAKING 

Wheat, corn and rye are the grains most com- 
monly used in bread making. The wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making as it contains the 
gluten (a protein) in the right proportions and of 
the right nature to form a spongy loaf. Except 
for a slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a per- 
fect food and we supply the need by the addition 
of butter. Rye ranks next to wheat in importance 
for bread making, but it is best used in combina- 
tion with wheat, because alone, it makes a heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn needs to be combined 
with wheat also, for if used alone the bread is 
crumbly, owing to the lack of gluten. 

In a cross-section of wheat three distinct parts 
are found; the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. 
The outside coat or bran is fibrous material, con- 
taining valuable mineral matter, protein, and 
a pigment which gives the wheat a brown color. 
The germ is the tiny plantlet or embryo. When 
growing, the little plant needs nourishment before 
it can get to the earth; so "Mother Nature" stores 

40 



CEREALS — BREAD MAKING

up a supply in the endosperm. The endosperm 
is made of irregular cells, separated by walls of 
delicate woody fiber or cellulose. Packed away 
in the cells are tiny grains of starch. The spaces

between the grains are filled principally with 
gluten. 

There are several varieties of wheat flour, de- 
pending upon the part of the grain used. Graham 
flour is made from the whole grain. The food 



42 HOME DIETETICS 

value is high because of the presence of the germ 
which contains a larger portion of fat than the 
rest of the seed. For this very reason though the 
flour will not keep as the fat becomes rancid. 
There is a large proportion of minerals and also of 
protein, but the protein is stored up in the coarse, 
indigestible bran; so, graham flour often has a 
slightly smaller amount of digestible protein than 
fine white flour. In whole wheat flour the outer 

husks and the germ a re removed ; 

while in the higher grade white 

flours all the bran is removed; 

that is, only the endosperm is 

used. 

Pastry flour is made from 

winter wheat, which contains 
Fig. 4. — Yeast ' 

Highly Magnified. les S gluten than spring wheat, 
from which bread flour is made. 
The pastry flour is cheaper, being made from lower 
priced wheat. In using bread flour in place of 
pastry flour for cakes, etc., the general rule is to 
use two tablespoons less to a cupful. 

Fermented is the term sometimes applied to 
breads in which yeast is used as a leavening agent. 
The yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant which grows 
by the simple process known as budding. Yeast, 
like any other plant, needs light, heat, and mois- 
ture for its growth. The temperature most favor- 




CEREALS — BREAD MAKING 43 

able is from 70 to 75°F. If colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above 90°F. 
the conditions are favorable for the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria and the bread "sours." Sugar 
feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is 
to some extent converted into sugar and thereby 
serves the same purpose. Salt retards the growth 
of the yeast somewhat, but we add it because it 
seems necessary to season the bread to our taste. 
The soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the 
yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxid. The carbon-dioxid gas becomes en- 
tangled in the gluten, and by expansion when 
heated, raises the bread. 

We begin the bread with either a sponge or 
"hard loaf," using liquid, dry, or compressed 
yeast. The compressed yeast proves very satis- 
factory, but should never be used unless light in 
color and without dark streaks. The bread should 
be kneaded thoroughly in order to incorporate the 
ingredients. It should be covered and set in a 
warm place until its bulk is doubled. The second 
kneading breaks up the bubbles of gas, thus pre- 
venting the formation of large holes in the bread ; 
and spreads the fermentation through the mixture. 
During the second kneading add as little flour as 



44 HOME DIETETICS 

possible. Shape and put into greased pans and 
again let it rise to double its bulk. 

The bread is baked to kill the ferment; to render 
the starch more soluble, and therefore, more 
digestible; to drive off the alcohol; to expand the 
carbon-dioxid and thus raise the mixture and 
to improve the flavor. The oven must be hot 
enough to raise the loaf to a temperature of 2i2°F. 
The best temperature for the oven is from 400 
to 500 . 

The bread shrinks from the pan when it is 
done, does not crack, and gives a hollow sound 
when tapped. Remove from the pan and cover 
lightly to cool.

doubles its bulk knead into shape, cover and let rise a second 
time. Bake in moderate oven 45 min. to 1 hr. 

A larger proportion of yeast is used in the class 
recipe in order to secure quicker results. One- 
half yeastcake is necessary for a two-hour lesson, 
provided the complete process is shown.

FANCY BREAD 

Proceed as above until the second kneading, then rolls of 
various sorts may be made. 

CLEFT ROLLS 

After kneading, make into small balls. Set the rolls to rise 
in a warm place. When they have reached double their size, 
cut the roll across the top about an inch deep. Brush the top 
with water and bake until a golden brown. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS 

Add 1 tb. sugar and 2 t. of butter to the dough. Knead 
thoroughly, then roll to one fourth inch in thickness, cut out 
with a biscuit cutter, brush lightly with butter, and fold. 
Place in a greased pan one inch apart. Let rise and bake in 
a hot oven for ten or fifteen minutes. 

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Breakfast cereals are specially milled or other- 
wise prepared foods, some of which are partially, 
others thoroughly, cooked at the factory. The 
uncooked cereal breakfast foods require long and 
slow cooking in order to break down the cell walls 
and free the stored starch grains so that they may 
be readily acted upon by the digestive juices. If 
a coal range is constantly in use the problem is 
easily met; otherwise, it is advisable to resort to a 
tireless cooker. Many forms of tireless cookers

are on the market, but it is easy to make one at 
home if one understands the principle. 1 

Look cereal over carefully, removing any bits 
of paper from the container or other foreign sub- 
stance, if found. Stir the required amount of 
cereal gradually into the required amount of boil- 
ing salted water. Boil, stirring constantly, un- 
til it begins to thicken. Complete the cooking by 
steaming.

LESSON VII— SECTION A 
MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Meats are common sources of protein and fat 
in the diet. These constituents can be and are ob- 
tained from other foods in greater or smaller pro- 
portion. Milk and eggs (see Lesson III) and 
cheese are common substitutes for meat, and so 
are the dry legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, 
etc.). Nuts are also used. 

Cheese. — Cheese is a concentrated form of food. 
It is rich in both protein and fat. In combination 
with starchy food it may frequently be used as a 
substitute for meat. Experiments have proved 
that cheese does not ordinarily cause indigestion 
and neither is it a frequent cause for constipation. 

Cheese should be kept wrapped in a slightly 
damp cloth or in paraffin paper and then in wrap- 
ping paper. It should be kept in a cool place. 
Never cover cheese in a dish from which the air 
has been wholly excluded, as it molds more readily 
under such conditions. 

Legumes. — Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
contain a larger percentage of protein than other 
vegetables, and a majority of these show a high 
percentage of carbohydrate. In addition the

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 5 1 

In view of the low cost and high nutritive value, 
dried legumes should be used frequently; not only 
as a meat substitute but to give a pleasing variety 
to the diet. 

Care in the preparation of legumes is very im- 
portant both as regards the digestibility and the 
flavor. The dried legumes should be soaked over 
night in water to which a little baking soda has 
been added. These vegetables require long cook- 
ing to soften the cellulose and also to develop the 
flavor. A little soda added to the water in which 
they are cooked also aids in softening the cellulose 
and neutralizes the vegetable acid found in some 
of the legumes. 

Although these foods are comparatively cheap 
the fuel required to cook them so long a time may 
increase their cost unless they are prepared on a 
day when the range is being used for other pur- 
poses, as, for laundry. The tireless cooker is sat- 
isfactory in cooking these dried foods. 

Nuts. — Nuts serve as an excellent source of 
energy and may replace, to a considerable extent, 
other proteins in the diet. They are a concen- 
trated food and therefore need, even more than 
meat, to be accompanied by fresh vegetables or 
fruits or other watery and bulky foods. When 
added to an already hearty meal, nuts may be the 
cause of digestive disturbances.

LESSON VIII— SECTION A 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Vegetables, except beans, peas and other 
legumes, are usually poor in protein and fat and 
owe their nutritive value largely to carbohy- 
drates. The latter consist mainly of starch, 
cellulose, and small amounts of sugar. They also 
contain relatively large proportions of important 
mineral nutrients. It should be remembered that 
vegetables often are more than half water and 
that their fuel value is therefore lower than might 
be supposed from their bulk. This bulk, however, 
is often useful in the diet (see p. no) and does not 
lessen the value of vegetables in the ordinary diet. 

In cooking, starchy vegetables should be placed 
in boiling water or in a hot oven, as the case may be, 
as experience has shown that this gives the best 
results. Vegetables should not be salted until 
they have been cooking about ten minutes, be- 
cause the salt tends to draw out the juices. 

Vegetables having a sweet, mild-flavored juice, 
as string beans and green peas, should be cooked 
in a covered utensil in a small quantity of water, 

56 



VEGETABLES AKD FRUITS 57 

which is served with the vegetable. Vegetables 
having a strong juice, as onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower, should be cooked in an uncovered 
utensil in a large quantity of water,, which is not 
usually served with the vegetable but which may 
be used for soup making. In the first class, the 
purpose is to retain all the sweetness and flavor; 
in the second class, the purpose is to make the 
vegetables more palatable and less likely to cause 
digestive disturbance by modifying the flavor. 
With potatoes the matter of quantity of water is 
one of convenience chiefly. 

Great care should be taken not to overcook 
vegetables, as this injures the color and flavor and 
may make them likely to cause digestive disturb- 
ances. Cook only long enough to make them 
tender. 

Fruits. — The nutritive value of fresh fruits, in 
proportion to their bulk, is low and is due largely 
to the sugar and the mineral matters present. 
After drying, fruits are much richer than when 
fresh, dates, raisins, figs, and prunes containing 50 
to 75 per cent, of grape and other sugars. Fruits 
are valuable in the dietary chiefly because of the 
salts and acids which they contain and because of 
the bulk of water and cellulose or woody fiber. 
These things tend to stimulate digestion and ex- 
cretion and the mineral salts are important for 



58 HOME DIETETICS 

body building and for other physiological purposes. 
Some dried fruits and fruit juices, like many of the 
fresh fruits, are useful for their laxative properties. 
As fruits rip.en, starch and similar carbohydrates 
are changed into sugar, flavor develops, and tex- 
ture softens. As a whole, fruits are well digested. 
Stewed fruits, as a rule, are preferable to raw for 
young children because of the softening of cellulose 
during cooking and because bacteria which may be 
in the raw fruit are destroyed.

LESSON VIII— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF VEGETABLES 

BOILED POTATO 

Wash in cold water and remove bruised or decayed places. 
If skins are removed, put the pared potatoes at once into cold 
water, so that they will not turn dark. If they are cooked with 
the skins on, more of the mineral matter just under the skin is 
retained. If potatoes vary in size, cut the larger ones in two 
pieces. Put into boiling water and cook until tender. The 
water should boil all the time, but not too hard. Salt at the 
end of ten minutes. When tender, drain off the water, remove 
lid, shake the saucepan gently over the stove, cover with a cloth, 
and stand on the back of the stove. 

BAKED POTATO 

Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to 1 hour, turning once or 
twice. When soft, break the skin, to allow the steam to escape, 
and serve at once. 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

To cream vegetables, use one cupful of cooked vegetables, cut 
into one-half inch cubes, to one cupful of medium-thick white 
sauce. (Seep. 52.) Heat in oven or on top of stove and serve 
at once. 

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream of vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable 
dish to serve at luncheon or supper. Great care should be used 
in combining acid vegetables, such as tomatoes, with milk, as 

61 



62 HOME DIETETICS 

the milk may curdle and spoil the texture of the dish. A very 
small quantity of soda added to the puree (strained vegetable 
pulp) will neutralize the acid and then it may be added to the 
milk. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Cook vegetables until soft. Strain the vegetables and keep 
the stock in which they are cooked. 

Make a thin white sauce, using i tb. butter, i tb. flour, % t. 
salt, and }i t. pepper, to i c. liquid (milk or stock, or part of 
each). 

Add the strained vegetable (puree) to the white sauce, then 
reheat and serve at once. 

Onion or other seasoning vegetable may be cooked with the 
vegetables and discarded just before straining. 

TOMATO BISQUE 
Equal quantities thin white sauce and tomato puree. 

(Individual Recipe)

Make a thin white sauce. Heat the strained tomato in a 
saucepan, add the soda. When effervescence has ceased, add 
slowly to the sauce, stirring constantly. Reheat but do not boil 
after materials are blended. Note: — If stronger flavor is liked, 
double the quantity of tomato.

LESSON IX— SECTION A 
DIGESTION 

The process of digestion includes the changes 
which the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
before it can be absorbed into the body tissue. 
The food is taken into the mouth where it is 
ground by the teeth and mixed with the saliva. 
Some of the starchy portion is changed to sugar 
by an enzym or ferment, known as "ptyalin," 
which is present in the salivary secretion. It was 
formerly believed that this transformation of 
starch to sugar was largely accomplished in the 
mouth but it is now recognized that only a small 
portion of the starch is changed in the mouth. 
However, this does not lessen the need of thor- 
oughly chewing the food, since it is more readily 
acted upon by the other digestive fluids in the 
stomach and intestine after being finely divided 
and softened by the saliva. 

On being swallowed the food goes beyond volun- 
tary control and is carried by the action of invol- 
untary muscles through the esophagus or tube 
leading from the mouth into the stomach. 

64 



DIGESTION 65 

In the stomach the food is acted upon by the 
ferments pepsin and rennin, which are present in 
the gastric juice, ted by glands in the walls 

<>f the stomach. Mingled with the gastrin juice 
h free bydrochlori< add, the presence of which is 
to render the pepsin active. The pep- 
sin ait- iipoo the protein components of the food 
and breaks them down into simpler soluble BUD- 
stances (profc ad pepi hit h in turn 

undergo Further changes in the intestine. The 
rennin causes the curdling 1 ilation 0! the 

protein in milk, and th|s be Qecessary for

dissolved and the fat is set free. The digestive

hydrolysis of starch in the mouth, are regarded 
as largely of a preliminary character. 



66 HOME DIETETICS 

From the stomach the food passes into the small 
intestine through which it is propelled by the peris- 
taltic movements and where the most important 
digestive changes take place. In the intestine 
are three secretions — the bile, the pancreatic juice, 
and the secretions from the glands in the walls of 
the intestine itself. All of these secretions are 
alkaline and neutralize the acid brought in with 
the food from the stomach so that the digestive 
processes which take place in the intestine are 
carried out in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium. 

The pancreatic secretion contains an enzym 
known as "pancreatic amylase" or "amylopsin," 
which acts like the ptyalin of the saliva and com- 
pletes the transformation of the starch into sugar. 
The pancreatic secretion also contains an enzym 
known as "steapsin" or "lipase," which hydrol- 
izes the fatty portions of the food, splitting them 
up into glycerin and fatty acids. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enzym, trypsin, which completes 
the process of breaking the protein components 
of the food down into peptones and breaks these 
peptones down still further into simpler com- 
pounds, called amino acids. 

The secretions of the intestine contain the en- 
zyms maltase, lactase, and invertase, which split 
the more complex sugars into simpler forms. 

After the various components of the food have 



DIGESTION (,- 

been broken down into simpler substances they 

are absorbed through the walls of the digestive 
tract by the blood system and utilized by the 
body. Absorption begins in the stomach where 
mineral salts and some soluble peptones may be 
taken up by the blood, but most of it is done in 
the intestine.

BAKED APPLES 

Select apples of uniform size. Wash, and remove core, leav- 
ing the blossom end. Fill the cavity with sugar and flavor with 
lemon juice or cinnamon, if desired. Place apples in baking 
dish, add enough hot water to cover the bottom of the dish and 
bake until tender (20 to 45 min.), basting every 10 minutes.

Wash and soak prunes overnight in water or sweet cider, 
enough to cover them. Add sugar and lemon to the water and 
cook 30 minutes. Omit the sugar and lemon if cider is used. 

SALADS 

Salads. — Salads give a pleasing variety to the 
diet and if well prepared are both wholesome and 
palatable. They are made in a great variety of 
ways and may be composed of meat, fish, vege- 
tables, and fruit, either alone or in combination. 

68 



COOKERY OF FRUITS AND MAKING OF SALADS 69 

Salads made of fresh green vegetables have little 
nutritive value except from the dressing served on 
them and the mineral matters which they some- 
times provide. They are suitable to serve at 
dinner after a substantial course. The material 
used in them should be crisp and cold and the 
dressing should be added at the table or just be- 
fore the salad is served. 

Salads of substantial materials such as meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese, may well form the main 
course at luncheon or supper. It i> quite common 
after cutting the materials in the proper shape and 
form, to mix a little oil and vinegar with them some 
time before serving, so that these may be absorbed. 
Such salads are often combined with crisp, fresh 
vegetables, which should be treated as described 
in the preceding paragraph. 

French dressings are more suitable for light 
salads of fruit and vegetables; and mayonnaise, 
cooked, or cream dressings for the heavier salads.

LESSON X— SECTION A 
FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 

"A dietary is that amount and combination of 
food which will keep a person in full health pro- 
vided he is normal to begin with." Ellen H. 
Richards. 

A dietary standard is a guide for home and 
institution management, rather than expressive of 
physiological requirement, as the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture points out. The standard 
for an individual depends upon many conditions. 
A man doing muscular work in the open air re- 
quires more food than a man leading a sedentary 
life. A man in the prime of life needs more food 
than either an older man or a boy. In general, a 
man needs more food than a woman because of his 
larger body and more vigorous life. Individuality 
plays an important part in choosing food for a 
particular person. A person may like this or 
that and refuse to touch what he does not like. 
This is largely the result of training. A child 
should be taught to eat a variety of foods, includ- 
ing fruits and vegetables. Climate and season 

72 



FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 73 

affect the appetite. In cold weather more heat- 
producing foods are needed, provided a person 
spends much time out of doors. 

Scientists have estimated that as a general rule 
a man at active work needs about 3000 calories of 
food per day; that a woman needs about 2400 
calories per day; that a boy from ten to six- 
teen years of age needs 2400 to 2700 calories 
of food per day. If very active, as he is when 
playing football or other active games, or at 
work, the boy needs a diet with much higher 
energy value — 3000 or 4500 calories, even. A 
girl from ten to sixteen years of age needs from 
1800 to 2400 calories per day. A younger child 
needs from 900 to 1500 calories per day. The pro- 
tein is less definitely determined than the energy, 
but 80 to 100 grams for 3000 calories of energy is a 
generally accepted figure. The dietary standard, 
to be consistent, should include figures for mineral 
matter, but these are difficult to give. It is gen- 
erally assumed, therefore, that a mixed diet 
including milk and vegetables and supplying 3000 
calories per day will provide the needed mineral 
matter. 

These figures express amounts of food, which 
seem rather difficult to understand, but when, in 
addition, the proportion of nutrients is considered, 
the problem is difficult. It is not possible for the

average housewife to attempt to make accurate 
dietetic calculations. In fact, after the calcula- 
tions were made it would be necessary to see that 
each individual at the table had his particular 
portion if he were to have a so-called "balanced 
ration." 

The problem has been simplified by Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, and the preceding table with the 
suggestions for its use are based upon his work. 

"The division must be more or less arbitrary, 
for some foods could go almost equally well in two 
or more groups. Thus milk, which is a general 
food, is included with the protein foods because 
it is a valuable source of this nutrient." Potatoes 
contain a large percentage of starch but their 
value for minerals has been used to determine their 
grouping. 

To obtain a fair estimate of the amount of food 
required by an individual, the approximate ioo 
calorie portions may be used. Suppose John is an 
adult at active work. He needs about 3000 
calories of food. His meals may consist of the 
following menus, and this single illustration which 
can not be said to represent an unusually generous 
diet and which yet furnishes 3000 calories of 
energy, shows that people probably err in eating 
too much rather than in eating too little.

There is much evidence for the conclusion that a 
man in the period of full vigor, weighing 150 



FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 77 

pounds, and engaged in moderately active, phys- 
ical work requires about ioo grams of protein per 
day. Dr. Langworthy states that a mixed diet 
which includes the five food groups (see table p. 
74) and which supplies from 3000 to 3500 calories 
of energy per day almost inevitably supplies the 
needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. 
The diet is more likely to meet this requirement 
when milk is included in it. "To be more exact 
a dietary standard should also include figures 
expressing mineral requirements and require- 
ments for vitamines (regulating substances) of 
which minute amounts at least are essential. 
With present knowledge it is difficult to give such 
data. It is believed, however, that a general mixed 
diet will provide what is needed of both these."

LESSON XI— SECTION A 
BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 

In making out a bill-of-fare, a consideration of 
the various nutrients is important. Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy has simplified this part of the problem 
so that guided by the table on page 74, it is 
possible to plan meals furnishing the nutrients in 
fairly accurate proportions. In using the lists 
from the table to form menus, it is necessary that 
each group be represented, if not at every meal, at 
least once a day. "The use of an excessive num- 
ber of food materials from any one group would 
result not only in making less appetizing meals but 
an undesirable proportion of food principles." 

The natural appetite tends to protect people 
from eating too much of one kind of food. With 
a few exceptions like bread and butter, the same 
kind of food should not be served twice at the 
same meal. Bean soup followed by a main course 
including baked beans would pall the sense of 
taste. Avoid monotony. It may be convenient 
for the housewife always to serve corned beef on 
Monday, hash on Tuesday, and so on, but it 
is very undesirable as far as attractiveness is 

80 



BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 8 1 

concerned. A schedule for 14 days can be much 
more safely used than one for 7 days. A knowl- 
edge of what is to be served often causes the mind 
to rebel against the food and this results in a loss 
of appetite. On the other hand, a surprise due 
to an unexpected dish stimulates the appetite. 

The market order must be carefully made out 
so that the supplies shall be at hand when the 
preparation for a meal begins. A thrifty house- 
keeper plans her meals so well that there are few 
remnants except those she definitely desires for one 
of the many palatable "left-over" dishes. It is 
cheaper to buy food in large quantities but this is 
possible only when there is a suitable place for 
storage. 

The cost of food must be considered in planning 
meals. It is necessary to remember that the 
cheapest food is not always the most economical. 
If we buy a cheap cut of meat it is usually tough, 
and by the time it is cooked and the cost of the 
gas added to the first cost it may prove more 
expensive than a more tender piece. However, 
if there is a fire in the coal range, anyway, or if a 
fireless cooker is used, there is economy in the 
cheaper cut. Vegetables and fruits used out of 
season are no more nourishing than when they 
are more abundant and cheaper and they are 
an extravagance for the average family. 



82 HOME DIETETICS 

Unnecessary waste should be avoided. Some 
vegetables and fruits have to be pared, cored, etc., 
but the waste may be reduced to the minimum. 
Potatoes may be carefully scrubbed and then 
boiled, and the outside skin removed before they 
are served. The flavor is not only better but the 
valuable mineral matter is retained. Ask the 
butcher to send home the trimmings of meat. 
The bones and lean meat may be used for soup 
stock. The fat can be tried out and used for 
shortening. Chicken fat thus prepared is excel- 
lent for cake. 

Labor spent in the preparation of food should 
be considered. Is not the housewife's energy of 
some value? A mother might far better prepare 
simpler meals, even though they are somewhat 
more expensive, than to work so hard that she 
comes to the table too tired to enjoy the meal with 
her family.

LESSON XII— SECTION A 
SERVING FAMILY MEALS 

In most homes some of the members of the 
household are engaged in occupations which re- 
quire them to be away during the greater part 
of the day. As a result of this the meal time, 
especially at night, is the only opportunity for 
real enjoyment in the family circle. Careful 
thought should therefore be given to planning 
and furnishing the dining-room. 

It should be a room large enough to meet the 
needs of the family, with an allowance for the 
occasional guest. There should be plenty of 
windows to admit light, air, and sunshine. A 
pleasant outlook is also desirable. 

The woodwork may be painted white or stained 
and varnished to harmonize with the furniture. 
The walls should be covered with a simple, plain 
paper which harmonizes with the rug and the 
furniture. The ceiling should be lightest in 
tone, the walls medium, and the rug darkest. 
A dark, cold room needs a warm toned paper, 
say one of yellow-brown, while a gray green or 
blue may be used on a warm, sunny room. A

SERVING FAMILY MEALS 87 

few pictures may be used, but a plate rail or any 
other "dust catcher" is undesirable. 

Direct artificial light which produces a glare 
is unpleasant in its effects. Either side lights or 
the modern indirect lighting is much better. The 
window curtains should be of a soft, simple 
material, such as muslin or scrim. The curtains 
are pleasing and they are also more sanitary if 
they are fastened to a small rod and then allowed 
to hang in straight folds which just clear the 
window sill. If more light is needed or if there 
is a beautiful outlook, slide the curtains from the 
center and fill the gap at the top with a piece of 
the curtain which is nine to twelve inches in length. 

Have only such furniture in the room as is 
really necessary. A table, chairs, and a sideboard 
or serving table are sufficient. It should be simple 
but substantial. Furniture which is made along 
plain lines and without ornamentation is in good 
taste. Choose chairs which have the lines of the 
back following the curve of the human body, as 
they will be much more comfortable. 

The linen should be simple in design and should 
be of good quality. There is no economy in 
buying cheap linen. The china, glass, and silver 
are also in better taste if they are either perfectly 
plain or are decorated near the edge with a simple, 
conventional design. Avoid gilt on cheap dishes.

the dish holding the plant. 



SERVING FAMILY MEALS 89 

Only the silver, glass, and china needed should 
be placed upon the table. They should be ar- 
ranged as indicated on the diagram. The silver 
is placed in order of use from the outside toward 
the plate; that is, a soup spoon should be placed 
still farther to the right if soup is to be the first 
course. 

With a simple home service it is important that 
all the food, dishes, etc., needed for a particular 
course, be on the table. Hot food should be 
served on hot dishes and cold food should be served 
on cold dishes. A wheel tray is convenient for 
such a service, and every woman doing her own 
work should not only own one, but should learn 
to use it. A very satisfactory wagon can be made 
by fastening a wooden tray upon the wheels of an 
old baby carriage.

LESSON XIII— SECTION A 

FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG 
CHILDREN 1 

Each year greater attention is given to the care 
and feeding of infants, so that they may be 
properly nourished and developed into healthy 
citizens, prepared to meet the responsibilities of 
life. To bring about these results the care must 
start with the birth of the child and continue 
throughout the years of growth and development. 

Nature's food, mother's milk, is most desirable 
for infants because it contains all the necessary 
nutrients in the right proportions to properly 
nourish the child. No perfect substitute for 
mother's milk has been obtained. It is necessary, 
however, to resort to artificial feeding when no 
milk is secreted, when the mother is delicate, or 
when the child does not thrive on mother's milk. 
Cow's milk is the usual substitute for mother's 
milk, but to be fed successfully to an infant it 
needs modifying to make it more nearly like 
mother's milk. Water may be added to it to 
reduce the protein and other nutrients; cream, to 

1 A practical demonstration of the care of bottles, nipples, etc., 
should be given with this lesson. 

92 



FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN 93 

increase the fat; milk-sugar, to increase the car- 
bohydrates; and sometimes lime water, to make 
the milk alkaline. If it becomes necessary to 
resort to artificial feeding, it is best to consult 
the family physician, who will either give a formula 
for modifying, or give directions how to obtain 
modified milk. 

In order that the infant may be healthy and 
thrive, whether breast-fed or bottle-fed, it is 
necessary not only to have the right food, but also 
to feed it regularly, to be sure that everything is 
kept in perfectly sanitary condition, to keep the 
child quiet after it is fed, and to allow it to sleep 
two or three hours after each feeding. 

After the first six or eight months, the physician 
may begin to prescribe simple gruels, etc., until 
the child can take whole milk. When the child is 
about fourteen months old, thicker cereals are some- 
times ordered. They should be thoroughly cooked 
for about three hours, and then strained. They 
may be fed from a spoon. 

By the end of the first year the normal child 
should be taking eight or nine ounces of food at 
a time, five times a day. During the second year 
the lime water and milk sugar may be gradually 
omitted and broth (mutton, veal, or chicken) and 
egg-white added. Orange juice and beef juice 
may also be given. 



94 HOME DIETETICS 

During the third year the child is given a 
greater quantity of solids. Potatoes and other 
vegetables are introduced into the diet. 

Detailed directions for feeding infants may be 
obtained from some recognized authoritative 
book, such as Holt's "The Care and Feeding of 
Children." 

When a child is old enough to be given solid 
foods, it is very essential to his health that he be 
allowed plenty of time for his meals and that he 
learn to masticate his food thoroughly. Food 
should be given at regular intervals, but nothing 
between meals. The largest meal should be given 
at the middle of the day, and a light supper at 
least a half-hour before bed-time. Milk may be 
given once between meals. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, 
eggs, beefsteak, mutton chops, roast lamb, and 
chicken; baked, boiled, or steamed vegetables; 
sponge cakes and lady-fingers (if not fresh) ; fruits, 
custards, junkets, rice pudding, tapioca, or gela- 
tine; milk, water, and cocoa. 

The following foods should not be given to 
children: Dried or salted meat or fish; raw vege- 
tables; fried foods; fresh or hot breads; rich cakes, 
pastry, and rich preserves; tea, coffee, or alcoholic 
drinks. 

It is not wise to wait until a child grows up before 



FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN 95 

teaching him good table manners. Children 
should not sit sidewise or on the edge of the chair. 
They should not put their elbows on the table. 
Warn them not to drink until they have swallowed 
the food that they may be eating. Do not let them 
lean their glasses over their nose while they are 
drinking. Teach them to eat solid food with a 
fork, taking only small portions at one time. 
Soup should be eaten quietly from the side of the 
spoon and it should be dipped away from rather 
than toward the person who is eating. Do not 
allow a child to tip dishes in order to get the last 
bit of food. When taking food from a dish in 
which it is served, the utensils supplied for that 
purpose should be used and not the child's knife, 
fork, or spoon. Children should not be allowed 
to reach across the table for food nor to reach in 
front of another person. When not in use, the 
knife and fork should be laid along the side of the 
plate and the spoon should be on the side of the 
saucer. Children should be cautioned against 
speaking when their mouths are full, keeping their 
mouths open when they are eating, or smacking 
their lips. They should not be allowed to monop- 
olize the conversation at the table but reasonable 
questions should be answered and they should 
be encouraged to contribute to the general conver- 
sation. There should be no such thing as "com-

pany manners." Careless or greedy habits should 
be checked as they appear. The problem is an 
easy one if parents are careful to observe the rules 
of good manners themselves, for children will 
become polite by imitation.

LESSON XIV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR SCHOOL 

The diet of a child is always important, as it 
determines to a large extent the physical condition 
in later life. All though school life, a constant 
supervision of the food of a child is necessary. 
Digestion and assimilation are very active; all 
parts of the body are increasing in size ; the muscles 
are trained to more coordinated activity; and 
the nervous system is constantly receiving and 
storing new impressions. The body requires suffi- 
cient food of the right kind to nourish it and to 
stimulate its activities. Investigations prove 
that many so-called backward children are dull 
because of the lack of proper nourishment. 

To keep up these body functions, to repair 
wastes of the body, and to aid in the development 
of new tissues, it is necessary to furnish liberal 
and well planned meals so arranged that they 
supply the needed mineral matters and growth- 
stimulating substances as well as protein and 
energy. Care must be taken to furnish variety 
in the food, for children in this period of unrest 
tire of a monotonous diet. Some foods may be 
chosen for flavor alone. 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL IOI 

Frequently children are interested in their play 
or other activities at meal time and their bodies 
are not in proper condition to take care of the 
food eaten. Sufficient time should be required 
to prepare for meals. A child should be required 
to wash his hands and face and comb his hair 
before coming to the table. He should keep his 
mouth clean and his teeth in good condition. 
After meals children should not play or work hard 
until sufficient time has been taken for the diges- 
tion of the food. To hurry to school with no 
breakfast or an insufficient amount and kind, 
causes hunger and fatigue during the morning and 
poor work in lessons. Children should be re- 
quired to take a full breakfast, consisting of fruit, 
fresh or stewed; well cooked cereal, served with 
milk or cream and a little sugar; some toast or 
day-old bread; and a drink of hot milk or cocoa. 
If the child will eat more, soft-cooked eggs may 
be added. 

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 

There is no time in the whole life history of the 
individual during which there is more urgent need 
of the materials required to build up the red blood 
cells than between the ages of twelve and sixteen. 
During this period the foundation of physical 
efficiency is laid, and the normal healthy boy or 



102 HOME DIETETICS 

girl will usually require almost as much food as 
an adult. 

At this age children develop abnormal appetites 
or notions about their food, and usually more 
attention must be given to flavors, attractiveness, 
and variety. As iron is a necessity for the de- 
velopment of the red blood cells, some of the foods 
containing high percentages of iron, such as beef, 
eggs, raisins, prunes, beans, peas,. lentils, or green 
vegetables, especially spinach, asparagus, cabbage, 
lettuce, and celery, should be used in the diet 
daily. 

To further the physical development of the 
child, besides supplying an abundance of non- 
stimulating food, it is necessary to watch care- 
fully the hygienic condition. The child should 
be trained in regular habits of life, should have 
plenty of out-of-door exercise and an abundance 
of sleep — from nine to ten hours daily. 

The Lunch Box. — When the child begins school 
his daily life is radically changed, and the food 
requirements of the body are greatly increased to 
meet the many new demands on the body. There 
is great need of a lunch in the middle of the session. 
In many schools a recess is given and lunches may 
be eaten. In some schools lunches are furnished 
by the school for a small sum. Children should 
be encouraged to bring lunches from home or 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL 103 

should be supplied with money to buy a lunch at 
school. 

Often the school is situated a long distance from 
home and the child is not able to go home for the 
mid-day meal. Such conditions require the child 
to carry enough lunch for the whole day, and the 
lunch box needs special attention. 

The box itself is of utmost importance, for the 
food must remain in it several hours. A metal 
box is most desirable as it can be easily sterilized. 
The collapsible type is most convenient to carry 
home when emptied. 

To have a lunch palatable after it has been 
packed several hours requires great care. Each 
article of food should be wrapped separately in 
paramne paper, which keeps the food from drying 
out. The small packages should then be packed 
closely but neatly. The appearance of the lunch 
box should be made as dainty and attractive as 
possible. Napkins, either paper or linen, should 
be included. 

Sandwiches usually form the main part of the 
lunch and can be prepared in attractive shapes 
from many different materials. The bread may 
be white, whole wheat, graham, oatmeal, or nut, 
and should be cut thin, about one-fourth inch thick. 
Choice may be made from a variety of fillings such 
as meats, fish, and eggs with or without a salad 
dressing; cheese, jellies, and peanut butter. 



104 HOME DIETETICS 

Something sweet should be included such as 
cakes, cookies, candies, dates, figs or raisins, and 
some relish such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery, 
or fresh fruit. If this can be supplemented with 
a cup of cocoa or a bowl of soup the child need 
not suffer as a result of carrying lunches to school. 

The lunch time at school should be as pleasant 
a meal time as any other, and good habits in 
eating as well as good manners should be developed.

LESSON XV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR THE SICK 

An invalid is a person disabled by infirmities 
or disease. As each case has a special cause or 
causes, each must be considered separately and 
a special diet planned. In each case the person 
will benefit greatly by proper dietetic and hygienic 
treatment. 

In hospitals and among nurses and physicians 
diets for invalids are usually classified as liquid, 
soft-solid, and special. Liquid diets include milk, 
broths, beef juice, beef tea, cocoa, fruit beverages, 
barley and rice waters, gruel, and cream soups. 
In soft diets are found soft-cooked eggs, milk 
toast, custards, jellies, junkets, ice creams, and 
ices. The solid diet includes simple foods con- 
taining solid parts, such as cereals, vegetables, 
meats, fruits, desserts (except pastry and rich 
cakes), and eggs in all forms except hard-boiled. 
Special diets are usually planned with particular 
reference to the peculiar condition of the patient 
and are especially prescribed by the physician. 

In preparing dietaries for invalids only a few 
general directions can be given, as each person 
needs certain foods, depending upon the disease, 
107 



108 HOME DIETETICS 

the constitution, surroundings, etc. The doctor 
should prescribe the diet the patient may have, 
and the nurse must follow his directions to the 
letter, giving the food in the proper quantities 
and at regular intervals. It is unwise to consult 
a patient about his food if he is on a diet. If a 
patient asks for some special food, always consult 
the doctor about it before giving it to the patient. 

Before serving an invalid bathe face and hands, 
adjust pillows, and fix him in as comfortable a 
position as possible. If a regular invalid table is 
not available, a pile of books or magazines on each 
side of the patient's knees will serve as supports 
for the tray, or a table may easily be prepared 
from a wooden soap box by removing the sides 
and top. The ends will form the table legs and 
the bottom the table top. 

Great care must be exercised in preparing the 
tray. It should be of a convenient size to ac- 
commodate the menu, and should be covered with 
a clean white cloth. 

The dishes should be the most attractive avail- 
able and should be arranged in an artistic but a 
simple form. A flower adds to the appearance of 
the tray and may please the invalid. Or, a little 
surprise in the nature of a gift or a letter or a note 
from a friend may distract his attention so that while 
enjoying these he unconsciously enjoys his meal 



FOOD FOR THE SICK IO9 

or takes the nourishment without paying much 
attention to it. 

In serving a patient, it is wise not to serve too 
many things at one time and always to serve in 
small quantities, for the patient will try to eat 
all of a small serving, while a generous serving 
may take away what little appetite he has. 
Be sure of the seasonings and temperature of the 
food and always serve hot foods hot and cold 
foods cold. When the diet is limited vary it as 
much as possible in preparation and serving. 

After the meal, the tray and all traces of the 
meal should be removed. 

If the patient's appetite is poor it may some- 
times be stimulated by giving fruit beverages, 
beef tea, and oysters. These in themselves have 
but little food value but tend to increase the 
flow of the digestive juices, and these in turn create 
a desire for food. 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked and 
toast should be crisp all through, not just browned 
on the outside. It may be softened with hot milk 
or water. 

Milk and eggs form the main articles in an in- 
valid's diet, and can be served in a variety of ways. 
Gelatines and ices furnish an attractive means of 
serving liquid foods in solid forms, and cream 
soups add variety to milk diet. 



IIO HOME DIETETICS 

Constipation, which is very common and which 
is frequently the source of many diseases, results 
from such causes as carelessness in attention to 
bodily functions at the proper time, lack of exer- 
cise, too little water, lack of bulk in food, lack of 
the natural laxative salts and acids of vegetables 
and fruits, improper habits in eating, or the use 
of indigestible foods. When constipation seems 
due to other than such causes a physician should 
always be consulted. 

Foods which in themselves are laxative are 
commonly of much benefit. The following are 
generally believed to aid greatly in relieving the 
trouble: oranges, lemons, grapefruit, apples, 
prunes, figs, asparagus and other green vegetables, 
molasses, honey, olive oil, butter, cream, oatmeal, 
whole-grain breads, bran biscuit, and buttermilk. 

Another common disease which needs dietetic 
and hygienic rather than medical treatment, is 
anemia. This disease results in an insufficient 
supply of red blood cells. It is often caused by 
improper diet, especially one lacking in foods 
containing iron; intestinal or other parasites; 
improper ventilation and clothing; lack of outdoor 
exercise; and an insufficient amount of sleep. 
In such cases a cure may be brought about by the 
use of plenty of well-cooked cereals, milk, eggs, 
simple foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, 



FOOD FOR THE SICK III 

and regular meals. It is better to take five light 
meals a day than three heavy meals. More seri- 
ous anemia is also known, so a physician's advice 
should be sought when anemia occurs.

INTRODUCTION 

This book is designed for general use in classes 
to be taught under the supervision of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross Nursing Service. The aim of the 
course is to give in a simple way the underlying 
principles of cookery. These are presented in 
fifteen lessons. There are also directions for four- 
teen lessons in practical cookery. For conven- 
ience a lesson in theory will usually be followed by 
one in practical cookery. For this reason one of 
each series of lessons is placed in each chapter of 
the book, in spite of the fact that this disturbs 
somewhat the logical arrangement of the subject- 
matter. 

The individual recipes are given for convenience 
in laboratory work. They may also be used if 
the teaching is done by the demonstration method 
unless it is desirable to prepare sufficient food to 
serve the class and then the home redpe may be 
used. Where meals are to be prepared, the home 
recipes are to be used and it will be convenient 
to have the pupils work in groups. Lack of time 
will often prevent the preparation of all the foods 
suggested in the practical lessons.

VI INTRODUCTION 

The equipment needed will depend upon 
whether the demonstration method of instruction 
or individual laboratory practice is adopted. In 
general, only cooking utensils are needed. 

The references given at the dose of each lesson 
are confined to U. S. Government publications 
which can be obtained either free or at a nominal 
price. In cases where no price is given single 
copies may be obtained (as long as the supply 
lasts) by application to the Department from which 
they are published. If several copies of the same 
publication are desired for class use, the request 
should be made through a Member of Congress. 
When a price is mentioned, the publication may be 
purchased for that sum from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washing- 
ton, D. C; remittances should be by coupons, 
postal money order, express order, or New York 
draft. 

To individual authors I may owe debts of which 
I am not aware, for my knowledge is an accumu- 
lation of material from various sources. The 
thoughts gleaned here and there have been inter- 
woven with my experience until a separation of 
that which belongs to others and that which is 
really my own seems impossible. I recognize 
clearly, though, that much of the best of my 



INTRODUCTION Vll 

material is the result of investigations made by the 
United States Government, particularly the 
Department of Agriculture. 

I wish to recognize here assistance which has 
been given me in preparing the work, by Anna G. 
Wetzel, teacher of dietetics, William Penn High 
School. Zeta B. Cxmdey, teacher of English, 
William Penn High School, has given me helpful 
criticism during the preparation of the manu- 
script. Dr. W. C. Rucker, Assistant Surgeon Gen- 
eral, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C, 
was kind enough to read and make useful sugges- 
tions for the last three lessons. To Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, Miss E. L. Hunt, and Miss H. W. 
Atwater, of the Office of Home Economics of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, I gratefully 
acknowledge my obligations for many suggestions 
and for very valuable constructive criticism.

LESSON I— SECTION A 

HYGIENE OF FOOD 

'' Cleanliness is a most important consideration in cook- 
ing, for food materials may be the means of transmitting 
disease. True cleanliness must take into account free- 
dom not only from what we know as "dirt" but also the 
micro-organisms which commonly accompany filth and 
dirt." 

In the world about us are hundreds of forms of 
bacteria which are invisible to the naked eye. 
They thrive best where uncleanly conditions exist 
Decaying animal and vegetable matter is espe- 
cially conducive to their growth. Some of these 
forms are of great value to man but others are a 
menace to a healthy body. 

Flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are germ 
carriers and they should be careftdly excluded 
from homes. Rats and even dogs and cats may 
spread disease. Danger also exists where dust 
collects for it may be laden with harmful forms of 
bacteria. Clean houses, clean clothing, clean 



2 • •* BlOUfE DEBTETICS 

bodies, and clean food are then of the utmost 
importance. 

The person who prepares food should wear 
clean clothing, simple in style, which can be 
easily laundered. Woolen dresses or "cast off" 
finery are entirely out of place in the kitchen. 
The body shoxild be kept clean by frequent baths, 
the hair shoxild be neatly combed, and the nose 
and mouth shoxild be kept in good condition. 
Special attention should be given to the hands. 
They should always be washed before handling 
food and especially after having been to the 
toilet. It is quite possible that harmful colon 
bacteria may be on the hands from just opening 
and shutting the door of the toilet. The finger 
nails should be free from dirt. Never dip any- 
thing but a clean spoon into food when tasting it. 

The dishes in which food is placed or served 
should be clean. After use they should be care- 
fxilly scraped and piled in an orderly manner. 
Two pans of water are necessary for washing 
dishes; one with hot, soapy water, to remove the 
grease, and the other with boilmg water for rinsing. 
Remember that high heat kills germs. It is far 
better to dry dishes by allowing the water to 
drain off from them than to wipe them on dirty 
towels. If they must be drained in a dusty place, 
they should be covered. Dish towels and dish 



HYGIENE OF FOOD 3 

cloths should be kept clean. Wash and rinse 
them each time after using. Frequent scalding 
is also necessary. It is better to wash the glass 
first, then the silver, and finally the china. 

Food shoxild not be exposed to dust either in 
the home or in the market. Housekeepers should 
refuse to buy imwrapped bread, or other food 
that has been imnecessarily exposed. Wash fruit 
thoroughly before it is used. Loathsome dis- 
eases have been contracted from eating fruit 
handled carelessly or by diseased persons. Flour, 
sugar, and other foods that come in bags shoidd be 
emptied into receptacles with tight covers. Re- 
move fresh meat from the wrapping paper, wipe 
with a clean, damp doth, and set near the ice or 
in the safe in the cellar. Milk should be kept in 
a closed vessel and in a cool place. The outside 
of the milk bottle shoidd be washed before the 
bottle is opened. Butter, if purchased in wooden 
trays, shoidd be removed inmmediately to a 
covered vessel. Frequently scald and air re- 
ceptacles in which food is kept. Sunshine kills 
germs. 

A refrigerator or a screened safe in a cellar for 
storing food should receive careful attention. 
Bits of food spilled on the shelves invite bacterial 
growth. Clean often with scalding water and 
washing soda or some other good cleaning material. 



4 HOME DIETETICS 

Keep a strainer in the sink to prevent particles 
of food from obstructing the drainage. This 
should be emptied into the garbage can after the 
dishes are scraped. Wash and rinse the strainer 
and hang it above the sink. After the dish wash- 
ing is finished, wash every part of the sink with 
soap and hot water and use a strong solution of 
washing soda at least once a week. 

Thoroughly clean and scald the garbage pail 
after it is emptied. Unless a local law prevents, 
line the garbage can with old newspapers before 
it is used again. Always keep the can tightly 
covered when in use.

LESSON II.— SECTION A 

NUTRIENTS 

The problem of nutrition is one of growing im- 
portance, not only because of the increased cost 
of food but because more and more we are coming 
to realize that a healthy body is man's greatest 
asset. 

Food is technically defined as anything which, 
when taken into the body, is capable of building 
or repauing tissue or furnishing energy. The 
energy is used for performing internal muscular 
work, as the beating of the heart, and external 
muscular work, as chopping wood, walking, or 
playing ball. 

Our bodies are wonderfxil pieces of machinery, 
far more wonderful than anything man has made. 
A variety of foods is needed to keep their intricate 
parts in normal condition. Nature, through our 
instincts, has gxiided us to some extent in the choice 
of foods. Her dictates were the starting point of 
our imderstanding of the facts about food and 
nutrition. They laid the foimdation of a science 
which is rapidly developing as the result of careful 
and painstaking laboratory studies. 

5 



6 HQME DIETETICS 

The scientist has classified the substances which 
make up our foods, or the nutrients, under five 
heads: water, mineral matters (ash), protein, car- 
bohydrates, and fats. 

Water ranks as food because it enters into the 
composition of every tissue, even bones and teeth. 
It regulates the body temperature and has a part 
to play in all nervous and muscular work. It has 
been estimated that two-thirds of the material in 
the human body is water, and smce water is con- 
tinually passing off from the body there must be 
a constant supply of it. Our foods as they are 
prepared for the table are about one-half water. 
They supply part but not all of the water needed, 
and must therefore be supplemented by drinking 
water. Since water is known to be capable of 
carrying diseases the greatest care shoidd be taken 
to keep the supply pure. 

Mineral substances play an important part in 
building the body and in its chemical reactions. 
There are many kinds used by the system. 
Among the most important are caldimi (lime) 
salts, which are needed for bone formation. They 
are found abundantly in milk, eggs, cereals, and 
vegetables. Children need a considerable amount 
of calcium salts and for this reason special atten- 
tion should be given to them in the diet. Lack 
of caldimi may show itself in the form of an ab- 



NT7TKIENTS 7 

normal appetite for such substances as plaster, 
wood, or chalk, or in poor teeth. 

Iron is very important, for its presence in the 
hemoglobin of the blood makes oxygen-carrjdng 
possible. Iron salts are found in nearly all foods, 
but especially in beef, eggs, oatmeal and some of 
the green vegetables. 

Common salt (sodiimi chlorid) occurs in every 
tissue of the body except the enamel of the teeth, 
so it is important in our food. There are many 
other necessary mineral constituents, such as com- 
pounds of magnesia, sulphur, phosphorus, etc., 
and fortunately these are foimd in many of our 
staple foods. 

Protein supplies nitrogen for tissue building. 
All people, old and young, need it to repair tissue 
waste. The growing child, however, needs it not 
only to repair waste but also for growth. There 
are several forms of protein, varying in composi- 
tion. It is probable that the different proteins 
supply nitrogen in forms suited to different bodily 
needs, but this subject is still a matter for discus- 
sion and investigation. Safety would therefore 
seem to lie in the habitual use of a number of dif- 
ferent kinds of protein, which explains perhaps 
the general tendency of man toward a mixed diet. 
We may obtain it from the animal and also from 
the vegetable kingdom, from milk, eggs, fish and 



^'^ 



8 HOME DIETETICS 

paeat, and also from cereals, legumes and nuts. 
Protein not only supplies nitrogen for tissue build- 
ing but may also be used as a source of energy. 
It is drawn upon for this purpose more largely if 
fats, starches, and sugars are limited in the diet. 

The carbohydrates (starch, sugar, cellulose, 
etc.) can not supply nitrogen and so can not re- 
place the nitrogen of protein as a building material, 
but they can spare it as a source of energy. Car- 
bohydrates are obtained mainly from the vegetable 
kingdom. 

Starch is manufactured by growing plants and 
stored up in the form of tiny grains lying within 
the plant cells. We obtain the greater part of 
the starch of our diet from cereals and potatoes. 

Sugars, except lactose or milk sugar, are ob- 
tained from the vegetable kingdom. By far the 
most abundant kind in our diet is sucrose, which 
is obtained chiefly from the sugar cane, the sor- 
ghum, and the beet. 

Fats, like carbohydrates, are incapable of re- 
placing protein as a source of nitrogen for body 
building and repair. They serve as a source of 
heat and energy and have an energy value, per 
pound, 23^ times that of protein or carbohydrates. 
We obtain them chiefly from meat, milk, eggs, and 
butter in the animal kingdom and from nuts, choc- 
olate, and olives in the vegetable kingdom. 



NUTRIENTS 9 

The body uses food as fuel, just as the engine 
uses coal. The xmit for measuring energy is the 
calorie and the fuel value of our various food mate- 
rials is therefore expressed in this term. It shoxild 
be remembered, however, that the fuel value of 
a food is not its only value, for the body requires 
protein to supply nitrogen to build and repair tis- 
sue. It is important, therefore, to know of a given 
food not only its total fuel value but also what 
part of the fuel is in the form of protein.

STANDARD MEASUREMENTS AND 

APPLICATION 

In this and all the lessons which follow the 
recipes are based upon level measurements. 
The standard cup, which holds one-half pint, 
is used. Flour should always be sifted before it 
is measured. 

The following abbreviations are used: c. for 
cup, tb. for tablespoon, t. for teaspoon, qt. for 
quart, pt. for pint, lb. for pound, and f.g. for 
few grains.

LESSON in— SECTION A 

MEAT AND FISH 

Meat, and the term is used here to include 
poultry as well as beef, mutton, and so on, is an 
important and a very generally used source of 
protein. An ordinary serving of meat once a 
day (or a like amount divided between two or all 
three meals) is a reasonable quantity, but it does 
not follow that more is harmful. Too much meat 
in the diet, however, is not economical, since it is 
seldom a cheap source of energy, and many be- 
lieve that a large amount of meat protein imposes 
a needless tax on the digestive and excretory 
organs and may be an important contributing 
cause to intestinal putrefaction. A part of the 
supply of protein should be obtained from milk, 
eggs, legumes, etc. 

The lean portion of meat is composed of bundles 
of fibers held together by connective tissue. Al- 
bimiin and gelatin are the principal proteins found 
in meat and they should always be ' considered 
when it is being prepared for food. Albumin is 
hardened by intense heat and gelatin is obtained 
from the connective tissue by long, slow applica- 
tion of heat, with moisture.

MEAT AND FISH 1 3 

'^Results of experiments show that there is no marked 
difference in ease of digestion of various kinds and cuts of 
meat. Over 9 5 per cent, of the proteins and fat is digested ; 
which means that the nutrients of meat are largely used 
by the body with little waste. Therefore, those who wish 
to use the cheaper cuts of meat need not fear that in so 
doing their families will be less well nourished than by 
the use of more expensive cuts." C. F. Langworthy. 

As it occurs in our food the protein from meat 
is more readily digested and absorbed than the 
vegetable protein and there is reason to believe 
that it is more valuable to the body, since it is 
more like body protein in structure and so more 
readily used. 

When a muscle is exercised vigorously the con- 
nective tissue increases in amount and becomes 
hardened and the muscle is consequently hardened 
or toughened and the amount of extractives (sub- 
stances which give flavor) increased. Tough 
meats, as a rule, therefore, contain more flavor 
than the other meats. There are many good ways 
of making palatable dishes from them. The cuts 
of tough meat are usually less expensive and their 
use is economical, especially when the flavors are 
to be drawn out, as in soups and stews. The 
shank and chuck are examples of tough cuts. 

The muscles that are exercised slightly have 
softer and often more fat connective tissue and so 
are more tender. These meats make the tender

cuts, such as the tenderloin and sirloin of beef. 
They are the most expensive parts of meat and are 
commonly used for roasting and broiling, rather 
than for the long, slow cooking desirable for 
tougher cuts. 

Some muscles have a moderate amount of exer- 
cise and lie near the muscles which are exercised 
more vigorously. They have tender fibers and a 
fair proportion of juice, and may well be used for 
boiling and roasting. The top of the round and 
the rump are illustrations.

USES OF CUTS OF BEEF 

The chuck is excellent for stews. It makes a 
very good roast and is sometimes sold as steaks. 

The ribs are sold for roasts, being cut into one, 
two, and three-rib pieces. 

The loin includes the porterhouse, sirloin, and 
tenderloin steaks. They are the choicest and 
highest priced cuts in beef. 

The rump contains the end of the hip bone and 
the joint. The fleshy part makes very good steaks 
and roasts. 

The round consists of ^ very juicy, lean muscle 
and contains but little bone. It is sold for roasts, 
steaks, beef tea, and beef juice. 

The shanks are cut from the fore and the hind 
legs. They are tough and contain bones and ten- 
dons. They are used for soups and stews. 

The flank is boneless and coarse-grained but 
good in flavor. It makes a good rolled roast, or 
it may be used for stews. 

The navel and clod are used for soups and stews. 

The brisket makes a good pot roast; or it may 
be used for soups and stews. 

Fish. — Fish is an important source of protein 
and may be used in the diet very much as meat 
is. It often contains less fat than meat and as 
has a lower fuel value, pound for pound. As a 



1 6 HOME DIETETICS 

source of fuel, therefore, lean fish, such as cod, 
might seem less economical even at a lower price 
than such cuts of beef as sirloin steak; but as a 
source of protein (the most expensive nutrient) it 
is much cheaper. The common practice of cook- 
ing fish with fat tends to compensate for its low 
fuel value. 

The different kinds of fresh fish are best at their 
peculiar seasons. Out of season they are inferior 
in flavor and have a disagreeable odor. In choos- 
ing fish, avoid those with dull eyes, pale red gills, 
and dry or easily-loosened scales. If the flesh is 
so soft when pressed with, a finger, that the inden- 
tation remains, it is unfit for use. 

Fish is often preserved by salting, smoking, or 
pickling. In these forms it can frequently be ob- 
tained more cheaply than fresh. When dried dur- 
ing the preserving process the nutrients become 
more concentrated, so that even at the same price 
per pound a given sum would buy more nutrients 
than if spent for fresh fish. Although dried fish 
is perhaps not to be recommended for very young 
children, there is no reason to suppose that when 
properly prepared it is not perfectly wholesome 
for normal adults. Grood canned fish also offers 
a convenient and economical substitute for fresh 
fish or for meat. 



LESSON in— SECTION B 

t 

COOKERY OF MEATS 

Fresh meat is firm to the touch and bright in 
color, red in the case of beef and mutton and red- 
dish pink in the case of pork and veal. The fat 
should be dry enough to crumble easily, and, in 
the case of beef, should be of a yellow color. The 
best beef is marbled with narrow lines of fat. 
When received from the market, meat should be 
taken from the paper and wiped thoroughly with a 
damp cloth. It should be covered and put in a 
a cool place. 

Tender meats should be cooked in their own 
juices to preserve the flavor. The juice may be 
kept in by hardening the albumin on the outside 
by means of high heat, as is the case when a broiled 
steak is put near the hot coals or a roast into a 
very hot oven. The temperature should then be 
lowered. There are three general ways of cooking 
tender meats: over hot coals, or broiling; pan 
broiling, or saut6ing; and roasting. Less com- 
monly tender meat (veal cutlet or chicken, for 
example,) is fried, either plain or crumbed, in deep 
fat 

17

METHODS OF COOKING TENDER MEJATS 

Broiling. — ^Place the meat on a greased broiler 
over hot coals or under the gas flame. Quickly 
sear over both sides to retain the juices; continue 
to turn often. Steak i inch thick will be cooked 
rare in 5 minutes, and well done in 6 minutes. 
There is a difference of opinion as to the best time 
to season broiled meat. If the seasonings are 
added before the broiling they penetrate the meat 
more thoroughly, but, on the other hand, the salt 
tends to draw out the juices. It is therefore better 
to add the seasonings at the end, to prevent waste 
of material. 

Pan Broiling. — ^Have the frying pan very hot 
and then grease it over with a small amount of 
fat. Bits of suet may be used for this purpose. 
Sear the meat over on both sides; then cook more 
slowly, turning the meat often. When sufficiently 
cooked, remove to a hot platter and serve. 

A thick brown sauce or gravy may be made by 
stirring flour smoothly into the fat in the pan and 
then gradually adding hot water, stirring all the 
time. The method and proportions are the same 
as used in making white sauce. (See p. 52.) 

Roasting. — Season the meat and dredge with 
flour. The starch grains of the flour under the 
influence of heat will form a pasty covering which 



COOKERY OF MEATS I9 

will aid in retaining the juices of the meat. Place 
uncovered on the grate in the oven of a coal range 
or in a hot gas range, and sear over, turning with 
a fork until the searing is complete. Then pour 
in at the side enough hot water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan and place the pan on the bottom 
of the oven, if a coal range is used. The meat 
should be frequently basted. A covered roasting 
pan is very deidrable. The water is then poured 
into the lower pan after the meat is seared over 
and the cover put on. Basting is then unneces- 
sary, as the steam will keep the meat moist. 
Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat and, 
if the roast is more than 4 pounds, fifteen minutes 
more for the heat to penetrate. Brown sauce may 
be made in the pan after the roast is removed. 

METHODS OF COOKING TOUGH MEATS 

The principle followed in cooking tough meats 
is to cook slowly at not too high a temperature 
keeping the meat moist. Pot roasting, stewing 
and casserole cooking are examples. 

Pot Roast. — ^Tough cuts are used for pot roasts. 
The meat should be put into boiling water and 
boiled for ten minutes until the albumin is hard- 
ened on the outside, to retain the juices. Season- 
ings should then be added and the meat cooked 



I 



20 HOME DIETETICS 

slowly until it is tender. The latter process can 
be carried out very successfully in a fireless cooker. 
If desired, the roast may be browned in the kettle 
by letting the water simmer away. When the 
roast is removed a brown sauce may be made in 
the regular way. If the meat is removed before 
browning and a sauce made in which the roast is 
cooked, it is necessary to stir the flour until free 
from lumps in a small portion of water before 
adding it. 

Soup. — ^If soup is desired the meat should be 
placed in cold water and brought to the simmering 
point. Cook slowly until the fibers fall apart 
and seem tasteless. A good order for soup stock 
consists of four pounds of soup meat beef; one 
knuckle of veal, well broken; and one pound of 
marrow bone. In ordering any kind of meat ask 
that the trimmings and bones be sent, as they may 
be used to replenish the soup stock. 

Stewed Meats. — ^In stewing meats we have a 
two-fold purpose; that is, to keep part of the 
juices in to retain the flavor of the meat, and to 
extract part of the juices to flavor the gravy. 
This may be accomplished by putting the meat into 
cold water and quickly bringing it to the boiling 
point. It should then be cooked slowly imtil 
tender.

LESSON IV— SECTION A 

MILK AND EGGS 

Milk and eggs are extremely important foods, 
particularly in the diet of the young and of in- 
valids. Eggs contain only a trace of carbohy- 
drate. Milk contains milk sugar but no starch. 
In general, neither needs cooking except to make 
it more palatable, and in the case of milk, to lessen 
the danger from harmful bacteria. As eggs and 
milk, like meat, contain much protein as com- 
pared with other nutrients, cooking at a low tem- 
\ perature is desirable so that they may be soft and 
under, rather than over-cooked. 

Great care should be used in handling milki 
We should demand that it be forwarded and 
delivered to us in a sanitary condition. The 
milk bottle should be carefully washed before the 
cover is removed. The milk may be left in the 
bottle until used, or, if preferred, poured into a 
freshly scalded and covered vessel. It should be 
set in a cool, clean place, free from dirt, flies, etc. 
If left at a temperature of 50° F. or less, good milk 
should remain sweet for twenty-four hours or 
more. 

24 



• 



MILK AND EGGS 2$ 

Much of the milk sold by dealers is pasteurized. 
This is to be distinguished from sterilized milk. 
Pasteurization is accomplished by bringing milk 
to a temperature of 60° to 65° C. (140° to 149° F.) 
and holding it there for twenty mmutes. Steril- 
izing milk means boiling it for a certain length of 
time or heating it nearly to the boiling point, allow- 
ing it to stand for some hours, and again heating 
it, repeating the operation several times. Boiled 
milk is very difficult for children to digest. Pas- 
teurized milk is preferable to boiled milk for this 
reason. It should not be necessary to depend on 
st^rilizmg or pasteurizing as a means of providing 
germ-free milk. The milk should be produced 
under clean conditions, even if it is to be pas- 
seurized. Where there is any doubt as to the 
tanitary quality of the milk, it should be pasteur- 
ized. Pasteurized milk is much better for chil- 
dren than raw milk of questionable quality. It 
is the opinion of many authorities that babies fed 
on pasteurized milk thrive fully as well as those 
fed on raw milk. 

Eggs spoil because of the action of bacteria 
which are either included in them before they are 
laid, or, less often, enter later through the pores 
of the shell. Eggs should be kept in a cool, clean 
place. 

During the season when eggs are plentiful it is 



26 HOME DIETETICS 

economical to buy a supply and preserve them. 
The best method of preservation is by the use of 
water glass, which may be obtained at a drug 
. store and diluted with water in the proportion of 
^ one part of water glass to five parts of pure water. 
Place the eggs in a clean stone jar and pour in the 
solution, leaving two inches of the liquid covering 
the top layer of eggs, and set in a cold place. 

Only clean, fresh eggs should be preserved. A 
good, fresh egg has a rough, dull shell and should 
not be smooth and shiny. K you are in doubt as 
to the freshness of eggs, candle them or see whether 
they sink when placed in a dish of fresh water. 
If an egg sinks it is reasonably fresh.

LESSON V— SECTION A 

CEREALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 

The cereals represent a fairly complete food, 
that is, one in which all the food principles are 
represented in. good proportions. They are grown 
in all parts of the world except the arctic regions 
and therefore form staple foods of all countries. 
They are widely grown, easily stored in good con- 
dition, usable in many ways, may be readily 
prepared for the table, and are palatable, and 
digestible. 

A study of the table shows that the cereals vary 
as to the proportion of nutrients but that carbo- 
hydrates predominate in aU grains. The carbo- 
hydrates are mainly in the form of starch and this 
determines the general method of cereal cookery. 
The starch grains are stored up in cells whose 
walls are a tough cellulose. High temperature and 
long continued cooking are necessary to break down 
the cell walls and to free the starch grains so that 
they may be acted upon by the digestive juices. 

The cereals are prepared for the table in a great 
variety of ways. Wheat, com, and rye are the 

31 



32 CEREALS — GENERAL DISCUSSION 

grains which are most frequently ground into flour 
and used for breads. Buckwheat is used for 
griddle cakes. Served with gravy or butter and 
S3niip, buckwheat cakes are high in energy value. 
Rice is a valuable food and may well be used fre- 
quently as a vegetable or prepared as a dessert. 
Among the cereals used for breakfast foods, oats 
are very valuable. Oatmeal is not only highljr 
nutritious but it gives bulk which is necessary for 
digestion and excretion. 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixtures are divided into two chief 
classes — batters and doughs. Each class may be 
subdivided. A batter may be made of one part 
liquid to one part of flour, and is then termed a 
thin batter; or, it may be made in the proportion 
of one part of liquid to two parts of flour and then 
forms a thick batter. A dough made in the pro- 
portion of one part liquid to three of flour is called 
a soft dough; and if the proportion is one part 
liquid to more than three of flour, it is then a stiff 
dough. Griddle cakes, popovers, and ginger 
bread are types of thin batter. Cakes come imder 
the head of thick batters, and the proportions 
should be kept in mind when a new redpe is being 
considered. The breads and pastry come under 



HOME DIETETICS 33 

the soft doughs, while cookies and crullers are 
stiff dough. 

Flour mixtures are raised or made light by means 
of leavens. The leavens most commonly used in 
bread making and for similar purposes are steam, 
air, and carbon di-oxide. The carbon di-oxide 
may be due to the growth of yeast or to the action 
of chemicals such as cooking soda and cream of 
tartar. The desired results are brought about 
by the action of definite physical laws, namely: 
that water converted into steam produces a force 
which tends to expand a mixture enclosing it, and 
that air or gas (carbon di-oxide), also expands 
when heated, producing a similar result. The 
flour is sifted and the egg is beaten to catch and 
hold the tiny quantities of air which may expand 
and make the mixture light, under the influence 
of heat during cooking. 

In using recipes for flour mixtures, remember 
that flour should always be sifted before measuring 
and that measurements should always be accurate, 
a knife being used to level off the flour at the top of 
the measuring cup or the baking powder in the tea 
spoon. If care is used there is no such thing as 
"luck" in baking; the results are always the same 
if the conditions are always the same.

LESSON V— SECTION B 
MAKING OF CAKE AND PASTRY 

CAKE MAKING 

All cakes may be classified under one of two 
headings; that is, they either contain fat and are 
then called butter cakes, or they do not contain 
fat, and are then called sponge cakes. The general 
method of handling each type is illustrated by the 
"plain cake" and the "hot water sponge cake." 
K a butter cake of very fine quality is desired, 
separate the egg, using only the beaten yolk at 
first, then fold in the beaten white just before the 
mixture is poured into the baking pan. 

GENERAL RULES FOR BAKING 

In baking, divide the time into quarters. First 
quarter, mixture should begin to rise. 

Second quarter, mixture continues rising and 
begins to brown. 

Third quarter, mixture continues browning. 

Fourth quarter, mixture finishes baking and 
shrinks from pan. 

35 



36 HOME DIETETICS 

Cake should often be looked at during the bak- 
ing. If the oven door is opened and closed care- 
fully there is no danger of the cake falling. 

Cake should not be moved in the oven until it 
is fully risen. After this time it may be moved 
so that it will brown evenly. 

Cake, when done, shrinks from the pan and does 
not retain indentation if pressed with the fingfer. 
It is wise to test with a small toothpick. If the 
toothpick comes out clean the cake is thoroughly 
done. 

Cake will crack if too much flour has been used, 
or if the oven is too hot.

PASTRY 

The use of pastry and its ease of digestion is a 
subject concerning which there is much disagree- 
ment. In general, it may be said that a tender, 
rich pastry is just as fully digested as many more 
simple foods, but a tough or "soggy" pastry may 
prove difficult of digestion. In the case of any 
digestive disorders, especially intestinal, it is wiser 
to omit pastry from the diet. 

Pastry consists of fat and starch which makes it 
a very concentrated food. It should therefore be 
considered as a substantial food rather than as a 
delicacy to be added to an already sufficient meal. 
More trouble comes from overeating, when pie is 
used as a dessert at a hearty meal, than from the 
indigestibility of the pastry itself. 



38 HOME DIETETICS 

The air incorporated in the mixture and the 
steam generated from the water used, are the 
leavens which make pastry light. It is necessary 
then to sift the flour, to cut in the fat, and to 
handle the dough lightly so that as much air as 
possible may become entangled in the mixture. 
If properly handled, a light, flaky product should 
always result.

LESSON VI— SECTION A 
CEREALS— BREAD MAKING 

Wheat, corn and rye are the grains most com- 
monly used in bread making. The wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making as it contains the 
gluten (a protein) in the right proportions and of 
the right nature to form a spongy loaf. Except 
for a slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a per- 
fect food and we supply the need by the addition 
of butter. Rye ranks next to wheat in importance 
for bread making, but it is best used in combma- 
tion with wheat, because alone, it makes a heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Com needs to be combined 
with wheat also, for if used alone the bread is 
crumbly, owing to the lack of gluten. 

In a cross-section of wheat three distinct parts 
are foimd; the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. 
The outside coat or bran is fibrous material, con- 
taining valuable mineral matter, protein, and 
a pigment which gives the wheat a brown color. 
The germ is the tiny plantlet or embryo. When 
growing, the little plant needs nourishment before 
it can get to the earth; so "Mother Nature" stores 

40 



CEREALS — ^BSEAD MAKING 41 

Up a supply in the endospenn. The endosperm 
is made of irregular cells, separated by walls of 
delicate woody fiber or cellulose. Packed away 
in the cells are tiny grains of starch. The spaces 



Fig. 3,— CEoss-SEcnoN o? Wheat. 

between the grains are filled principally with 
gluten. 

There are several varieties of wheat flour, de- 
pending flpon the part of the grain used. Graham 
flour is made from the whole grain. The food 



42 HOME DIETETICS 

value is high because of the presence of the germ 
which contains a larger portion of fat than the 
rest of the seed. For this very reason though the 
flour will not keep as the fat becomes rancid. 
There is a large proportion of minerals and also of 
protein, but the protein is stored up in the coarse, 
indigestible bran; so, graham flour often has a 
slightly smaller amoimt of digestible protein than 
fine white flour. In whole wheat flour the outer 

husks and the germ are removed ; 

while in the higher grade white 

flours all the bran is removed; 

that is, only the endosperm is 

used. 
Pastry flour is made from 
^ „ v^.„ winter wheat, which contains 

Fig. 4. — Yeast ' 

Highly Magnified, less gluten than spring wheat, 

from which bread flour is made. 
The pastry flour is cheaper, being made from lower 
priced wheat. In using bread flour in place of 
pastry flour for cakes, etc., the general rule is to 
use two tablespoons less to a cupful. 

Fermented is the term sometimes applied to 
breads in which yeast is used as a leavening agent. 
The yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant which grows 
by the simple process known as budding. Yeast, 
like any other plant, needs light, heat, and mois- 
ture for its growth. The temperature most favor- 




CEREALS — REREAD MAKING 43 

able is from 70® to 7S®F. K colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above po^F. 
the conditions are favorable for the growth of 
lactic add bacteria and the bread " sours." Sugar 
feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is 
to some extent converted into sugar and thereby 
serves the same purpose. Salt retards the growth 
of the yeast somewhat, but we add it because it 
seems necessary to season the bread to our taste. 
The soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the 
yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxid. The carbon-dioxid gas becomes en- 
tangled in the gluten, and by expansion when 
heated, raises the bread. 

We begin the bread with either a sponge or 
"hard loaf," using liquid, dry, or compressed 
yeast. The compressed yeast proves very satis- 
factory, but should never be used unless light in 
color and without dark streaks. The bread should 
be kneaded thoroughly in order to incorporate the 
ingredients. It should be covered and set in a 
warm place imtil its bulk is doubled. The second 
kneading breaks up the bubbles of gas, thus pre- 
venting the formation of large holes in the bread; 
and spreads the fermentation through the mixture. 
During the second kneading add as little flour as 



44 HOME DIETETICS 

possible. Shape and put into greased pans and 
again let it rise to double its bulk. 

The bread is baked to kill the ferment; to render 
the starch more soluble, and therefore, more 
digestible; to drive oflf the alcohol; to expand the 
carbon-dioxid and thus raise the mixture and 
to improve the flavor. The oven must be hot 
enough to raise the loaf to a temperature of 2i2°F. 
The best temperature for the oven is from 400° 
to 500°. 

The bread shrinks from the pan when it is 
done, does not crack, and gives a hollow sound 
when tapped. Remove from the pan and cover 
lightly to cool.

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Breakfast cereals are speciaUy milled or other' 
wise prepared foods, some of which are partially, 
others thoroughly, cooked at the factory. The 
uncooked cereal breakfast foods require long and 
slow cooking in order to break down the cell walls 
and free the stored starch grains so that they may 
be readily acted upon by the digestive juices. If 
a coal range is constantly in use the problem is 
easily met; otherwise, it is advisable to resort to a 
fireless cooker. Many forms of fireless cookers

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Meats are common sources of protein and fat 
in the diet. These constituents can be and are ob- 
tained from other foods in greater or smaller pro- 
portion. Milk and eggs (see Lesson III) and 
cheese are common substitutes for meat, and so 
are the dry legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, 
etc.). Nuts are also used. 

Cheese. — Cheese is a concentrated form of food. 
It is rich in both protein and fat. In combination 
with starchy food it may frequently be used as a 
substitute for meat. Experiments have proved 
that cheese does not ordinarily cause indigestion 
and neither is it a frequent cause for constipation. 

Cheese should be kept wrapped in a slightly 
damp cloth or in paraflin paper and then in wrap' 
ping paper. It should be kept in a cool place. 
Never cover cheese in a dish from which the air 
has been wholly excluded, as it molds more readily 
under such conditions. 

Legumes. — ^Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
contain a larger percentage of protein than other 
vegetables, and a majority of these show a high 
percentage of carbohydrate. In addition the

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 5 1 

In view of the low cost and high nutritive value, 
dried legumes should be used frequently; not only 
as a meat substitute but to give a pleasing variety 
to the diet. 

Care in the preparation of legumes is very im- 
portant both as regards the digestibility and the 
flavor. The dried legumes should be soaked over 
\^ night in water to which a little baking soda has 
been added. These vegetables require long cook- 
ing to soften the cellulose and also to develop the 
flavor. A little soda added to the water in which 
they are cooked also aids in softening the cellulose 
and neutralizes the vegetable acid found in some 
of the legumes. 

Although these foods are comparatively cheap 
the fuel required to cook them so long a time may 
increase their cost unless they are prepared on a 
day when the range is being used for other pur- 
poses, as, for laundry. The fireless cooker is sat- 
isfactory in cooking these dried foods. 

Nuts. — ^Nuts serve as an excellent source of 
energy and may replace, to a considerable extent, 
other proteins in the diet. They are i concen- 
trated food and therefore need, even more than 
meat, to be accompanied by fresh vegetables or 
fruits or other watery and bulky foods. When 
added to an already hearty meal, nuts may be the 
cause of digestive disturbances.

LESSON Vin— SECTION A 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Vegetables, except beans, peas and other 
legumes, are usually poor in protein and fat and 
owe their nutritive value largely to carbohy- 
drates. The latter consist mainly of starch, 
cellulose, and small amounts of sugar. They also 
contain relatively large proportions of important 
mineral nutrients. It should be remembered that 
vegetables often are more than half water and 
that their fuel value is therefore lower than might 
be supposed from their bulk. This bulk, however, 
is often useful in the diet (see p. i lo) and does not 
lessen the value of vegetables in the ordinary diet. 

In cooking, starchy vegetables should be placed 
in boiling water or in a hot oven, as the case may be, 
as experience has shown that this gives the best 
results. Vegetables should not be salted until 
they have been cooking about ten minutes, be- 
cause the salt tends to draw out the juices. 

Vegetables having a sweet, mild-flavored juice, 
as string beans and green peas, should be cooked 
in a covered utensil in a small quantity of water, 

56 



VEGETABLES AND FRTHTS 57 

which is served with the vegetable. Vegetables 
having a strong juice, as onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower, should be cooked in an uncovered 
utensil in a large quantity of water, which is not 
usually served with the vegetable but which may 
be used for soup making. In the first class, the 
purpose is to retain all the sweetness and flavor; 
in the second class, the purpose is to make the 
vegetables more palatable and less likely to cause 
digestive disturbance by modifying the flavor. 
With potatoes the matter of quantity of water is 
one of convenience chiefly. 

Great care should be taken not to overcook 

vegetables, as this injures the color and flavor and 

may make them likely to cause digestive disturb- 

\ ances. Cook only long enough to make them 

tender. 

Fruits. — ^The nutritive value of fresh fruits, in 
proportion to their bulk, is low and is due largely 
to the sugar and the mineral matters present. 
After drying, fruits are much richer than when 
fresh, dates, raisins, figs, and pnmes containing 50 
to 75 per cent, of grape and other sugars. Fruits 
are valuable in the dietary chiefly because of the 
salts and acids which they contain and because of 
the bulk of water and cellulose or woody fiber. 
These things tend to stimulate digestion and ex- 
cretion and the mineral salts are important for 



58 HOME DIETETICS 

body building and for other phjrsiological purposes. 
Some dried fruits and fruit juices, like many of the 
fresh fruits, are useful for their laxative properties. 
As fruits ripen, starch and similar carbohydrates 
are changed into sugar, flavor develops, and tex- 
ture softens. As a whole, fruits are well digested. 
Stewed fruits, as a rule, are preferable to raw for 
young children because of the softening of cellulose 
during cooking and because bacteria which may be 
in the raw fruit are destroyed.

LESSON VIII— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF VEGETABLES 

BOILED POTATO 

Wash in cold water and remove bruised or decayed places. 
If skins are removed, put the pared potatoes at once into cold 
water, so that they will not turn dark. If they are cooked with 
the skins on, more of the mineral matter just under the skin is 
retained. If potatoes vary in size, cut the larger ones in two 
pieces. Put into boiling water and cook until tender. The 
water should boil all the time, but not too hard. Salt at the 
end of ten minutes. When tender, drain off the water, remove 
lid, shake the saucepan gently over the stove, cover with a cloth, 
and stand on the back of the stove. 

BAKED POTATO 

Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to i hour, turning once or 
twice. When soft, break the skin, to allow the steam to escape, 
and serve at once. 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

To cream vegetables, use one cupful of cooked vegetables, cut 
into one-half inch cubes, to one cupful of medium-thick white 
sauce. (See p. 53.) Heat in oven or on top of stove and serve 
at once. 

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream of vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable 
dish to serve at luncheon or supper. Great care should be used 
in combining add vegetables, such as tomatoes, with milk, as

the milk may curdle and spoil the texture of the dish. A very 
small quantity of soda added to the pur6e (strained vegetable 
pulp) will neutralize the add and then it may be added to the 
milk. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Cook vegetables until soft. Strain the vegetables and keep 
the stock in which they are cooked. 

Make a thin white sauce, using i tb. butter, z tb. flour, }4 t. 
salt, and }i t. pepper, to i c. liquid (milk or stock, or part of 
each). 

Add the strained vegetable (pur^) to the white sauce, then 
reheat and serve at once. 

Onion or other seasoning vegetable may be cooked with the 
vegetables and discarded just before straining. 

TOMATO BISQUE 
Equal quantities thin white sauce and tomato pur6e. 

(Individual Recipe) 

z t. butter f . g. pepper 

z t. flour H c. milk 

}i t. salt }i c. strained tomato 

yi t. soda 

Make a thin white sauce. Heat the strained tomato in a 
saucepan, add the soda. When effervescence has ceased, add 
slowly to the sauce, stirring constantly. Reheat but do not boil 
after materials are blended. Note: — If stronger flavor is liked, 
double the quantity of tomato. 

BREAD STICKS 

To Serve With the Soup 

Cut bread }4 inch thick^ spread with butter, cut into length- 
wise strips, dust lightly with paprika, and brown in oven.

LESSON IX— SECTION A 

DIGESTION 

The process of digestion includes the changes 
which the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
before it can be absorbed into the body tissue. 
The food is taken into the mouth where it is 
ground by the teeth and mixed with the saliva. 
Some of the starchy portion is changed to sugar 
by an enzym or ferment, known as "ptyalin," 
which is present in the salivary secretion. It was 
formerly believed that this transformation of 
starch to sugar was largely accomplished in the 
mouth but it is now recognized that only a small 
portion of the starch is changed in the mouth. 
However, this does not lessen the need of thor- 
oughly chewing the food, since it is more readily 
acted upon by the other digestive fluids in the 
stomach and intestine after being finely divided 
and softened by the saliva. 

On being swallowed the food goes beyond volim- 
tary control and is carried by the action of invol- 
untary muscles through the esophagus or tube 
leading from the mouth into the stomach. 

64 



DIGESTION 6$ 

In the stomach the food is acted upon by the 
ferments pepsin and rennin, which are present in 
the gastric juice, secreted by glands in 'the walls 
of the stomach. Mingled with the gastric juice 
is free hydrochloric acid, the presence of which is 
necessary to render the pepsin active. The pep- 
sin acts upon the protein components of the food 
and breaks them down into simpler soluble sub- 
stances (proteoses and peptones), which in turn 
undergo further changes in the intestine. The 
rennin causes the curdling or coagulation of the 
protein in milk and this seems to be necessary for 
the action of the pepsin. The explanation of the 
action of rennin is not definitely known, since tiie 
coagulated mass of milk protein must be dissolved 
again and rennin is present in the stomachs of 
animals not eating milk as a part of their normal 
diet. The ferments of the stomach have no effect 
upon the starchy portion of the food but the ac- 
tion of the ptyalin from the saliva continues for 
some time after the food reaches the stomach. 
Generally speaking, the fats in the food are not 
acted upon by the gastric ferments to any great 
extent but the cell walls which enclose the fat are 
dissolved and the fat is set free. The digestive 
changes which take place in the stomach, like the 
hydrolysis of starch in the mouth, are regarded 
as largely of a preliminary character. 



66 HOME DIETETICS 

From the stomach the food passes into the small 
intestine through which it is propelled by the peris- 
taltic movements and where the most important 
digestive changes take place. In the intestine 
are three secretions — the bile, the pancreatic juice, 
and the secretions from the glands in the walls of 
the intestine itself. All of these secretions are 
alkaline and neutralize the acid brought in with 
the food from the stomach so that the digestive 
processes which take place in the intestine are 
carried out in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium. 

The pancreatic secretion contains an enzym 
known as "pancreatic amylase" or "amylopsin," 
which acts like the ptyalin of the saliva and com- 
pletes the transformation of the starch into sugar. 
The pancreatic secretion also contains an enzym 
known as "steapsin" or "lipase," which hydrol- 
izes the fatty portions of the food, splitting them 
up into glycerin and fatty acids. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enzjon, trj^sin, which completes 
the process of breaking the protein components 
of the food down into peptones and breaks these 
peptones down still further into simpler com- 
pounds, called amino acids. 

The secretions of the intestine contain the en- 
Z3mis maltase, lactase, and invertase, which split 
the more complex sugars into simpler forms. 

After the various components of the food have 



DIGESTION 67 

been broken down into simpler substances they 
are absorbed through the walk of the digestive 
tract by the blood system and utilized by the 
body. Absorption begins in the stomach where 
mineral salts and some soluble peptones may be 
taken up by the blood, but most of it is done in 
the intestine.

SALADS 

BAKED APPLES 

Select apples of uniform size. Wash, and remove core, leav- 
ing the blossom end. Fill the cavity with sugar and flavor with 
lemon juice or cinnamon, if desired. Place apples in baking 
dish, add enough hot water to cover the bottom of the dish and 
bake until tender (20 to 45 min.), basting every 10 minutes. 

STEWED PRUNES

cook 30 minutes. Omit the sugar and lemon if cider is used. 

SALADS 

Salads. — Salads give a pleasing variety to the 
diet and if well prepared are both wholesome and 
palatable. They are made in a great variety of 
ways and may be composed of meat, fish, vege- 
tables, and fruit, either alone or in combination.

COOKERY OF FRUITS AND UAKING OF SALADS 69 

Salads made of fresh green vegetables have little 
nutritive value except from the dressing served on 
them and the mineral matters which they some- 
times provide. They are suitable to serve at 
dinner after a substantial course. The material 
used in them should be crisp and cold and the 
dressing should be added at the table or just be- 
fore the salad is served. 

Salads of substantial materials such as meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese, may well form the main 
course at luncheon or supper. It is quite common 
after cutting the materials in the proper shape and 
form, to mix a little oil and vinegar with them some 
time before serving, so that these may be absorbed. 
Such salads are often combined with crisp, fresh 
vegetables, which should be treated as described 
in the preceding paragraph. 

French dressings are more suitable for light 
salads of fruit and vegetables; and mayonnaise, 
cooked, or cream dressings for the heavier salads. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING

LESSON X— SECTION A 

FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 

''A dietary is that amount and combination of 
food which will keep a person in full health pro- 
vided he is normal to begin with.'' Ellen H. 
Richards. 

A dietary standard is a guide for home and 
institution management, rather than expressive of 
physiological requirement, as the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture points out. The standard 
for an individual depends upon many conditions. 
A man doing muscular work in the open air re- 
quires more food than a man leading a sedentary 
life. A man in the prime of life needs more food 
than either an older man or a boy. In general, a 
man needs more food than a woman because of his 
larger body and more vigorous life. Individuality 
plays an important part in choosing food for a 
particular person. A person may like this or 
that and refuse to touch what he does not like. 
This is largely the result of training. A child 
should be taught to eat a variety of foods, includ- 
ing fruits and vegetables. Climate and season

FUEL VALUE AKD DIETARY STANDARDS 73 

affect the appetite. In cold weather more heat- 
producing foods are needed, provided a person 
spends much time out of doors. 

Scientists have estimated that as a general rule 
a man at active work needs about 3000 calories of 
food per day; that a woman needs about 2400 
calories per day; that a boy from ten to six- 
teen years of age needs 2400 to 2700 calories 
of food per day. If very active, as he is when 
playing football or other active games, or at 
work, the boy needs a diet with much higher 
energy value — ^3000 or 4500 calories, even. A 
girl from ten to sixteen years of age needs from 
1800 to 2400 calories per day. A younger child 
needs from 900 to 1500 calories per day. The pro- 
tein is less definitely determined than the energy, 
but 80 to 100 grams for 3000 calories of energy is a 
generally accepted figure. The dietary standard, 
to be consistent, should include figures for mineral 
matter, but these are difficult to give. It is gen- 
erally assumed, therefore, that a mixed diet 
including milk and vegetables and supplying 3000 
calories per day will provide the needed mineral 
matter. 

These figures express amounts of food, which 
seem rather difficult to understand, but when, in 
addition, the proportion of nutrients is considered, 
the problem is difficult. It is not possible for the

average housewife to, attempt to make accurate 
dietetic calculations. In fact, after the calcula- 
tions were made it would be necessary to see that 
each individual at the table had his particular 
portion if he were to have a so-called "balanced 
ration." 

The problem has been simplified by Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, and the preceding table with the 
suggestions for its use are based upon his work. 

"The division must be more or less arbitrary, 
for some foods could go almost equally well in two 
or more groups. Thus milk, which is a general 
food, is included with the protein foods because 
it is a valuable source of this nutrient." Potatoes 
contain a large percentage of starch but their 
value for minerals has been used to determine their 
grouping. 

To obtain a fair estimate of the amount of food 
required by an individual, the approximate loo 
calorie portions may be used. Suppose John is an 
adult at active work. He needs about 3000 
calories of food. His meals may consist of the 
following menus, and thissingle illustration which 
can not be said to represent an unusually generous 
diet and which yet furnishes 3000 calories of 
energy, shows that people probably err in eating 
too much rather than in eating too little.

pounds, and engaged in moderately active, phys- 
ical work requires about loo grams of protein per 
day. Dr. Langworthy states that a mixed diet 
which includes the five food^ groups (see table p. 
74) and which supplies from 3000 to 3500 calories 
of energy per day almost inevitably supplies the 
needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. 
The diet is more likely to meet this requirement 
when milk is included in it. "To be more exact 
a dietary standard should also include figures 
expressing mineral requirements and require- 
ments for vitamines (regulating substances) of 
which minute amoimts at least are essential. 
With present knowledge it is difficult to give such 
data. It is believed, however, that a general mixed 
diet will provide what is needed of both these."

LESSON XI— SECTION A 
BUL-OF-FARE MAKING 

In making out a bill-of-fare, a consideration of 
the various nutrients is important. Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy has simplified this part of the problem 
so that guided by the table on page 74, it is 
possible to plan meals furnishing the nutrients in 
fairly accurate proportions. In using the lists 
from the table to form menus, it is necessary that 
each group be represented, if not at every meal, at 
least once a day. "The use of an excessive num- 
ber of food materials from any one group would 
result not only in making less appetizing meals but 
an imdesirable proportion of food principles." 

The natural appetite tends to protect people 

from eating too much of one kind of food. With 

a few exceptions like bread and butter, the same 

kind of food should not be served twice at the 

same meal. Bean soup followed by a main coiirse 

including baked beans would pall the sense of 

taste. Avoid monotony. It may be convenient 

for the housewife always to serve corned beef on 

Monday, hash on Tuesday, and so on, but it 

is very imdesirable as far as attractiveness is 

80 



BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 8 1 

concernecj. A schedule for 14 days can be much 
more safely used than one for 7 days. A knowl- 
edge of what is to be served often causes the mind 
to rebel against the food and this results in a loss 
of appetite. On the other hand, a surprise due 
to an unexpected dish stimulates the appetite. 

The market order must be carefully made out 
so that the supplies shall be at hand when the 
preparation for a meal begins. A thrifty house- 
keeper plans her meals so well that there are few 
remnants except those she definitely desires for one 
of the many palatable "left-over" dishes. It is 
cheaper to buy food in large quantities but this is 
possible only when there is a suitable place for 
storage. 

The cost of food must be considered in-planning 
meals. It is necessary to remember that the 
cheapest food is not always the most economical. 
If we buy a cheap cut of meat it is usually tough, 
and by the time it is cooked and the cost of the 
gas added to the first cost it may prove more 
expensive than a more tender piece. However, 
if there is a fire in the coal range, anyway, or if a 
fireless cooker is used, there is economy in the 
cheaper cut. Vegetables and fruits used out of 
season are no more nourishing than when they 
are more abundant and cheaper and they are 
an extravagance for the average family. 



82 HOME DIETETICS 

Unnecessary waste should ht avoided. Some 
vegetables and fruits have to be pared, cored, etc., 
but the waste may be reduced to the minimum. 
Potatoes may be carefully scrubbed and then 
boiled, and the outside skin removed before they 
are served. The flavor is not only better but the 
valuable mineral matter is retained. Ask the 
butcher to send home the trimmings of meat. 
The bones and lean meat may be used for soup 
stock. The fat can be tried out and used for 
shortening. Chicken fat thus prepared is excel- 
lent for cake. 

Labor spent in the preparation of food should 
be considered. Is not the housewife's energy of 
some value? A mother might far better prepare 
simpler meals, even though they are somewhat 
more expensive, than to work so hard that she 
comes to the table too tired to enjoy the meal with 
her family.

LESSON Xn— SECTION A 

SERVING FAMILY MEALS 

In most homes some of the members of the 
household axe engaged in occupations which re- 
quire them to be away during the greater part 
of the day. As a result of this the meal time, 
especially at night, is the only opportunity for 
real enjoyment in the family circle. Careful 
thought should therefore be given to planning 
and furnishing the dining-room. 

It should be a room large enough to meet the 
needs of the family, with an allowance for the 
occasional guest. There should be plenty of 
windows to admit light, air, and sunshine. A 
pleasant outlook is also desirable. 

The woodwork may be painted white or stained 
and varnished to harmonize with the furniture. 
The walls should be covered with a simple, plain 
paper which harmonizes with the rug and the 
furniture. The ceiling should be lightest in 
tone, the walls medium, and the rug darkest. 
A dark, cold room needs a warm toned paper, 
say one of yellow-brown, while a gray green or 
blue may be used on a warm, sunny room. A

is unpleasant in its effects. Either side lights or 
the modern indirect lighting is much better. The 
window curtains should be of a soft, simple 
material, such as muslin or scrim. The curtains 
are pleasing and they are also more sanitary if 
they are fastened to a small rod and then allowed 
to hang in straight folds which just clear the 
window sill. K more light is needed or if there 
is a beautiful outlook, slide the curtains from the 
center and fill the gap at the top with a piece of 
the curtain which is nine to twelve inches in length. 

Have only such furniture in the room as is 
really necessary. A table, chairs, and a sideboard 
or serving table are suflGldent. It should be simple 
but substantial. Furniture which is made along 
plain lines and without ornamentation is in good 
taste. Choose chairs which have the lines of the 
back following the curve of the human body, as 
they will be much more comfortable. 

The linen should be simple in design and should 
be of good quality. There is no economy in 
buying cheap linen. The china, glass, and silver 
are also in better taste if they are either perfectly 
plain or are decorated near the edge with a simple, 
conventional design. Avoid gilt on cheap dishes.

A table cloth may be used with propriety at 
any meal, but doilies are permissible for break- 
fast and luncheon. When a cloth is used, a

or a few cut flowers give a touch of beauty to the 
table. A simple white doily may be used under 
the dish holding the plant

Only the silver, glass, and china needed should 
be placed upon the table. They should be ar- 
ranged as indicated on the diagram. The silver 
is placed in order of use from the outside toward 
the plate; that is, a soup spoon should be placed 
still farther to. the right if soup is to be the first 
course. 

With a simple home service it is important that 
all the food, dishes, etc., needed for a particular 
course, be on the table. Hot food should be 
served on hot dishes and cold food should be served 
on cold dishes. A wheel tray is convenient for 
such a service, and every woman doing her own 
work should not only own one, but should learn 
to use it. A very satisfactory wagon can be made 
by fastening a wooden tray upon the wheels of an 
old baby carriage.

LESSON Xni— SECTION A 

FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG 

CHILDREN^ 

Each year greater attention is given to the care 
and feeding of infants, so that they may be 
properly nourished and developed into healthy 
citizens, prepared to meet the responsibilities of 
life. To bring about these results the care must 
start with the birth of the child and continue 
throughout the years of growth and development. 

Nature's food, mother's milk, is most desirable 
for infants because it contains all the necessary 
nutrients in the right proportions to properly 
nourish the child. No perfect substitute for 
mother's milk has been obtained. It is necessary, 
however, to resort to artificial feeding when no 
milk is secreted, when the mother is delicate, or 
when the child does not thrive on mother's milk. 
Cow's milk is the usual substitute for mother's 
milk, but to be fed successfully to an infant it 
needs modifying to make it more nearly like 
mother's milk. Water may be added to it to 
reduce the protein and other nutrients; cream, to 

^ A practical demonstration of the care of bottles, nipples, etc., 
should be given with this lesson. 

92 



FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN 93 

increase the fat; 'milk-sugar, to increase the car- 
bohydrates; and sometimes lime water, to make 
the milk alkaline. If it becomes necessary to 
resort to artificial feeding, it is best to consult 
the family physician, who will either give a formula 
for modifying, or give directions how to obtain 
modified milk. 

In order that the infant may be healthy and 
thrive, whether breast-fed or bottle-fed, it is 
necessary not only to have the right food, but also 
to feed it regularly, to be sure that everything is 
kept in perfectly sanitary condition, to keep the 
child quiet after it is fed, and to allow it to sleep 
two or three hours after each feeding. 

After the first six or eight months, the physician 
may begin to prescribe simple gruels, etc., until 
the child can take whole milk. When the child is 
about fourteen months old, thicker cereals are some- 
times ordered. They should be thoroughly cooked 
for about three hours, and then strained. They 
may be fed from a spoon. 

By the end of the first year the normal child 
should be taking eight or nine oimces of food at 
a time, five times a day. During the second year 
the lime water and milk sugar may be gradually 
omitted and broth (mutton, veal, or chicken) and 
egg-white added. Orange juice and beef juice 
may also be given. 



94 HOME DIETETICS 

During the third year the child is given a 
greater quantity of solids. Potatoes and other 
vegetables are introduced into the diet. 

Detailed directions for feeding infants may be 
obtained from some recognized authoritative 
book, such as Holt's ''The Care and Feeding of 
Children." 

When a child is old enough to be given solid 
foods, it is very essential to his health that he be 
allowed plenty of time for his meals and that he 
learn to masticate his food thoroughly. Food 
should be given at regular intervals, but nothing 
between meals. The largest meal should be ffven 
at the middle of the day, and a light supper at 
least a half-hour before bed-time. Milk may be 
given once between meals. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, 
eggs, beefsteak, mutton chops, roast lamb, and 
chicken; baked, boiled, or steamed vegetables; 
sponge cakes and lady-fingers (if not fresh) ; fruits, 
custards, jimkets, rice pudding, tapioca, or gela- 
tine; milk, water, and cocoa. 

The following foods should not be given to 
children: Dried or salted meat or fish; raw vege- 
tables; fried foods; fresh or hot breads; rich cakes, 
pastry, and rich preserves; tea, coflFee, or alcoholic 
drinks. 

It is not wise to wait imtil a child grows up before

teaching him good table manners. Children 
should not sit sidewise or on the edge of the chair. 
They should not put their elbows on the table. 
Warn them not to drink imtil they have swallowed 
the food that they may be eating. Do not let them 
lean their glasses over their nose while they are 
drinking. Teach them to eat solid food with a 
fork, taking only small portions at one time. 
Soup should be eaten quietly from the side of the 
spoon and it should be dipped away from rather 
than toward the person who is eating. Do not 
allow a child to tip dishes in order to get the last 
bit of food. When taking food from a dish in 
which it is served, the utensils supplied for that 
purpose should be used and not the child's knife, 
fork, or spoon. Children should not be allowed 
to reach across the table for food nor to reach in 
front of another person. When not in use, the 
knife and fork should be laid along the side of the 
plate and the spoon should be on the side of the 
saucer. Children should be cautioned against 
speaking when their mouths are full, keeping their 
mouths open when they are eating, or smacking 
their lips. They should not be allowed to monop- 
olize the conversation at the table but reasonable 
questions should be answered and they should 
be encouraged to contribute to the general conver- 
sation. There should be no such thing as '' com-

be checked as they appear. The problem is an 
easy one if parents are careful to observe the rules 
of good manners themselves, for children will 
become polite by imitation.

LESSON XIV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR SCHOOL 

The diet of a child is always important, as it 
determines to a large extent the physical condition 
in later life. All though school life, a constant 
supervision of the food of a child is necessary. 
Digestion and assimilation are very active; all 
parts of the body are increasing in size; the muscles 
are trained to more coordinated activity; and 
the nervous system is constantly receiving and 
storing new impressions. The body reqidres suffi- 
cient food of the right kind to nourish it and to 
stimulate its activities. Investigations prove 
that many so-called backward children are dull 
because of the lack of proper nourishment. 

To keep up these body functions, to repair 
wastes of the body, and to aid in the development 
of new tissues, it is necessary to furnish liberal 
and well planned meals so arranged that they 
supply the needed mineral matters and growth- 
stimulating substances as well as protein and 
energy. Care must be taken to furnish variety 
in the food, for children in this period of unrest 
tire of a monotonous diet. Some foods may be 
chosen for flavor alone. 

lOO 



POOD FOR :SGflOOI/ ' lOI 

Frequently children are interested in their play 
or Other activities at meal time and their bodies 
are not in proper condition to take care of the 
food eaten. Sufficient time should be reqiured 
to prepare for meals. A child should be required 
to wash his hands and face and comb his hair 
before coming to the table. He should keep his 
mouth clean and his teeth in good condition. 
After meals children should not play or work hard 
imtil sufficient time has been taken for the diges- 
tion of the food. To hurry to school with no 
breakfast or an insufficient amount and kind, 
causes htmger and fatigue during the morning and 
poor work in lessons. Children should be re- 
quired to take a full breakfast; consisting of fruit, 
fresh or stewed; well cooked cereal, served with 
milk or cream and a little sugar; some toast or 
day-old bread; and a drink of hot milk or cocoa. 
K the child will eat more, soft-cooked eggs may 
be added. 

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 

There is no time in the whole life history of the 
individual during which there is more urgent need 
of the materials required to build up the red blood 
cells than between the ages of twelve and sixteen. 
During this period the fotmdation of physical 
Inefficiency is laid, and the normal healthy boy or 



I02 fioke- DliiTETICS 

girl will usually require almost as much food as 
an adult. 

At this age children develop abnormal appetites 
or notions about their food, and usually more 
attention must be given to flavors, attractiveness, 
and variety. As iron is a necessity for the de- 
velopment of the red blood cells, some of the foods 
containing high percentages of iron, such as beef, 
eggs, raisins, prunes, beans, peas, lentils, or green 
vegetables, especially spinach, asparagus, cabbage, 
lettuce, and celery, should be used in the diet 
daily. 

To further the physical development of the 
child, besides supplying an abundance of non- 
stimulating food, it is necessary to watch care- 
fully the hygienic condition. The child should 
be trained in regular habits of life, should have 
plenty of out-of-door exercise and an abtmdance 
of sleep — ^from nine to ten hours daily. 

The Lunch Box. — ^When the child begins school 
his daily life is radically changed, and the food 
reqidrements of the body are greatly increased to 
meet the many new demands on the body. There 
is great need of a lunch in the middle of the session. 
In many schools a recess is given and lunches may 
be eaten. In some schools lunches are furnished 
by the school for a small sum. Children should 
be encouraged to bring lunches from home ori 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL IO3 

should be supplied vdth money to buy a Itmch at 
school. 

Often the school is situated a long distance from 
home and the child is not able to go home for the 
mid-day meal. Such conditions require the child 
to carry enough lunch for the whole day, and the 
lunch box needs special attention. 

The box itself is of utmost importance, for the 
food must remain in it 3^veral hours. A metal 
box is most desirable as it can be easily sterilized. 
The collapsible type is most convenient to carry 
home when emptied. 

To have a limch palatable after it has been 
packed several hours reqidres great care. Each 
article of food should be wrapped separately in 
paraffine paper, which keeps the food from drying 
out. The small packages should then be packed 
closely but neatly. The appearance of the lunch 
box should be made as dainty and attractive as 
possible. Napkins, either paper or linen, should 
be included. 

Sandwiches usually form the main part of the 
lunch and can be prepared in attractive shapes 
from many different materials. The bread may 
be white, whole wheat, graham, oatmeal, or nut, 
and should be cut thin, about one-fourth inch thick. 
Choice may be made from a variety of fillings such 
as meats, fish, and eggs with or without a salad 
dressing; cheese, jellies, and peanut butter. 

8 



I04 HOME DIETETICS 

Something sweet should be included such as 
cakeS; cookies, candies, dates, figs or raisins, and 
some relish such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery, 
or fresh fruit. If this can be supplemented with 
a cup of cocoa or a bowl of soup the child need 
not suffer as a result of carrying lunches to school. 

The Itmch time at school should be as pleasant 
a meal time as any other, and good habits in 
eating as well as good msgmers should be developed.

LESSON XV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR THE SICK 

An invalid is a person disabled by infirmities 
or disease. As each case has a special cause or 
causes, each must be considered separately and 
a special diet planned. In each case the person 
will benefit greatly by proper dietetic and hygienic 
treatment. . 

In hospitals and among nurses and physicians 
diets for invalids are usually classified as liquid, 
soft-solid, and special4 Liquid diets include milk, 
broths, beef juice, beef tea, cocoa, fruit beverages, 
barley and rice waters, gruel, and cream soups. 
In soft diets are found soft-cooked eggs, ttiiIIc 
toast, custards, jellies, jimkets, ice creams, and 
ices. The solid diet includes simple foods con- 
taining solid parts, such as cereals, vegetables, 
meats, fruits, desserts (except pastry and rich 
cakes), and eggs in all forms except hard-boiled. 
Special diets are usually planned with particular 
reference to the peculiar condition of the patient 
and are especially prescribed by the ph3rsician. 

In preparing dietaries for invalids only a few 

general directions can be given, as each person 

needs certain foods, depending upon tb^ di^as^i 

107 



to8 HOME DIETETICS 

the constitution, surroundings, etc. The doctor 
should prescribe the diet the patient may have, 
and the nurse must follow his directions to the 
letter, giving the food in the proper quantities 
and at regular intervals. It is imwise to consult 
a patient about his food if he is on a diet. If a 
patient asks for some special food, always consult 
the doctor about it before giving it to the patient. 

Before serving an invalid bathe face and hands, 
adjust pillows, and fix him in as comfortable a 
position as possible. If a regular invalid table is 
not available, a pile of books or magazines on each 
side of the patient's knees will serve as supports 
for the tray, or a table may easily be prepared 
from a wooden soap box by removing the sides 
and top. The ends will form the table legs and 
the bottom the table top. 

Great care must be exercised in preparing the 
tray. It should be of a convenient size to ac- 
commodate the menu, and should be covered with 
a clean white cloth. 

The dishes should be the most attractive avail- 
able and should be arranged in an artistic but a 
simple form. A flower adds to the appearance of 
the tray and may please the invalid. Or, a little 
surprise in the nature of a gift or a letter or a note 
from a friend may distract his attention so that while 
enjoying these he unconsciously enjoys his meal 



FOOD FOR THE SICK I09 

or takes the nourishment without paying much 
attention to it. 

In serving a patient, it is wise not to serve too 
many things at one time and always to serve in 
small quantities, for the patient will try to eat 
all of a small serving, while a generous serving 
may take away what little appetite he has. 
Be sure of the seasonings and temperature of the 
food and always serve hot foods hot and cold 
foods cold. When the diet is limited vary it as 
much as possible in preparation and serving. 

After the meal, the tray and all traces of the 
meal should be removed. 

If the patient's appetite is poor it may some- 
times be stimulated by giving fruit beverages, 
beef tea, and oysters. These in themselves have 
but little food value but tend to increase the 
flow of the digestive juices, and these in turn create 
a desire for food. 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked and 
toast should be crisp all through, not just browned 
on the outside. It may be softened with hot milk 
or water. 

Milk and eggs form the main articles in an in- 
valid's diet, and can be served in a variety of ways. 
Gelatines and ices furnish an attractive means of 
serving Uquid foods in solid forms, and cream 
soups add variety to milk diet. 



no HOME DIETETICS 

Constipation, which is very common and which 
is frequently the source of many diseases, results 
from such causes as carelessness in attention to 
bodily functions at the proper time, lack of exer- 
cise, too little water, lack of bulk in food, lack of 
the natural laxative salts and adds of vegetables, 
and fruits, improper habits in eating, or the use 
of indigestible foods. When constipation seems 
due to other than such causes a physician should 
always be consulted. 

Foods which in themselves are laxative are 
commonly of much benefit. The following are 
generally believed to aid greatly in relieving the 
trouble: oranges, lemons, grapefruit, apples, 
prunes, figs, asparagus and other green vegetables, 
molasses, honey, olive oil, butter, cream, oatmeal, 
whole-grain breads, bran biscuit, and buttermilk. 

Another common disease which needs dietetic 
and hygienic rather than medical treatment, is 
anemia. This disease results in an insufficient 
supply of red blood cells. It is often caused by 
improper diet, especially one lacking in foods 
containing iron; intestinal or other parasites; 
improper ventilation and clothing; lack of outdoor 
exercise; and an insufficient amount of sleep. 
In such cases a cure may be brought about by the 
use of plenty of well-cooked cereals, milk, eggs, 
simple foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables,.

INTRODUCTION 



F53 

^1 This book Is designed for general use in classes 
^r to be taught under the supervision of the Ameri- 
' can Red Cross Nursing Service. The aim of the 
course is to give in a simple way the underlying 
principles of cookery. These are presented in 
fifteen lessons. There are also directions for four- 
teen lessons in practical cookery. For conven- 
ience a lesson in theory will usually be followed by 
one in practical cookery. For this reason one of 
each series of lessons is placed in each chapter of 
the book, in spite of the fact that this disturbs 
somewhat the logical arrangement of the subject- 
matter. 

The individual recipes are given for convenience 
in laboratory work. They may also be used if 
the teaching is done by the demonstration method 
unless it is desirable to prepare sufficient food to 
serve the class and then the home recipe may be 

tUsed, Where meals are to be prepared, the home 
recipes are to be used and it will be convenient 
to have the pupils work in groups. Lack of time 
will often prevent the preparation of all the foods 
suggested in the practical lessons.

INTRODUCTION 



The equipment needed will depend upon 

whether the demonstration method of instruction 
or individual laboratory practice is adopted. In 
geneial, only cooking utensils are needed. 

The references given at the close of each lesson 
are confined to U. S. Government publications 
which can be obtained either free or at a nominal 
price. In cases where no price is given single 
copies may be obtained (as long as the supply 
lasts) by apphcation to the Department from which 
they are published. If several copies of the same 
publication are desired for class use, the request 
should be made through a Member of Congress. 
When a price is mentioned, the publication may he 
purchased for that sum from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing Office, Washing- 
ton, D, C; remittances should be by coupons, 
postal money order, express order, or New York 
draft. 

To individual authors I may owe debts of which 
I am not aware, for my knowledge is an accumu- 
lation of material from various sources. The 
thoughts gleaned here and there have been inter- 
woven with my experience until a separation of 
that which belongs to others and that which is 
really my own seems impossible. I recognize 
clearly, though, that much of the best of my 



INTRODUCTION Vll 

material is the result of investigations made by the 
United States Government, pajrticulariy the 
Department of Agriculture. 

I wish to recognize here assistance which has 
been given me in preparing the work, by Anna G. 
Wetzel, teacher of dietetics, William Penn High 
School. Zeta B. Cundey, teacher of English, 
William Penn High School, has given me helpful 
criticism during the preparation of the manu- 
script. Dr. W. C. Rucker, Assistant Surgeon Gen- 
eral, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C, 
was kind enough to read and make useful sugges- 
tions for the last three lessons. To Dr. C, F. 
Langworthy, Miss E. L. Himt, and Miss H. W. 
Atwater, of the Office of Home Economics of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, I gratefully 
acknowledge my obligations for many suggestions 
and for very valuable constructive criticism.

LESSON I— SECTION A 

HYGIENE OF FOOD 

"Cleanliness is a most important consideration in cook- 
ing, for food materials may be the means of transmitting 
disease. True cleanliness must take into account free- 
dom not oniy from what we know as "dirt" but also the 
micro-organisms which commonly accompany filth and 
dirt." 

In the world about us are hundreds of forms of 
bacteria which are invisible to the naked eye. 
They thrive best where uncleanly conditions exist. 
Decaying animal and vegetable matter is espe- 

Icially conducive to their growth. Some of these 
forms are of great value to man but others axe a 
menace to a healthy body- 
Flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are germ 
carriers and they should be carefully excluded 
from homes. Rats and even dogs and cats may 
spread disease. Danger also exists where dust 
collects for it may be laden with harmful forms of 



2 HOME DIETETICS 

bodies, and clean food are tben of the utmost 
importance. 

The person who prepares food should wear 
clean clothing, simple in style, which can be 
easily laundered. Woolen dresses or "cast off" 
finery are entirely out of place in the kitchen. 
The body should be kept clean by frequent baths, 
the hair should be neatly combed, and the nose 
and mouth should be kept in good condition. 
Special attention should be given to the hands. 
They should always be washed before handling 
food and especially after having been to the 
toilet. It is quite possible that harmful colon 
bacteria may be on the hands from just opening 
and shutting the door of the toilet. The finger 
nails should be free from dirt. Never dip any- 
thing but a clean spoon into food when tasting it. 

The dishes in which food is placed or served 
should be clean. After use they should be care- 
fully scraped and piled in an orderly manner. 
Two pans of water are necessary for washing 
dishes; one with hot, soapy water, to remove the 
grease, and the other with boiling water for rinsing. 
Remember that high heat kills germs. It is far 
better to dry dishes by allowing the water to 
drain oS from them than to wipe them on dirty 
towels. If they must be drained in a dusty place, 
they should be covered. Dish towels and dish 



HYGIENE or FOOD 3 

cloths should be kept clean. Wash and rinse 
them each time after using. Frequent scalding 
is also necessary. It is better to wash the glass 
first, then the silver, and finally the china. 

Food should not be exposed to dust either in 
the home or in the market. Housekeepers should 
refuse to buy unwrapped bread, or other food 
that has been unnecessarily exposed. Wash fruit 
thoroughly before it is used. Loathsome dis- 
eases have been contracted from eating fruit 
handled carelessly or by diseased persons. Flour, 
sugar, and other foods that come in bags should be 
emptied into receptacles with tight covers. Re- 
move fresh meat from the wrapping paper, wipe 
with a clean, damp cloth, and set near the ice or 
in the safe in the cellar. Milk should be kept in 
a closed vessel and in a cool place. The outside 
of the milk bottle should be washed before the 
bottle is opened. Butter, if purchased in wooden 
trays, should be removed inmmediately to a 
covered vessel. Frequently scald and air re- 
ceptacles in which food is kept. Sunshine kills 
germs. 

A refrigerator or a screened safe in a cellar for 
storing food should receive careful attention. 
Bits of food spilled on the shelves invite bacterial 
growth. Clean often with scalding water and 
washing soda or some other good cleaning material. 



4 HOME DIETETICS 

Keep a strainer in the sink to prevent particles 
of food from obstructing the drainage. This 
should be emptied into the garbage can after the 
dishes are scraped. Wash and rinse the strainer 
and^hang it above the sink. After the dish wash- 
ing is finished, wash every part of the sink with 
soap and hot water and use a strong solution of 
washing soda at least once a week. 

Thoroughly clean and scald the garbage pail 
after it is emptied. Unless a local law prevents, 
line the garbage can with old newspapers before 
it is used again. Always keep the can tightly 
covered when in use.

LESSON II.— SECTION A 
NUTRIENTS 

The problem of nutrition is one of growing im- 
portance, not only because of the increased cost 
of food but because more and more we are coming 
to realize that a healthy body is man's greatest 
asset. 

Food is technically defined as anything which, 
when taken into the body, is capable of building 
or repairing tissue or furnishing energy. The 
energy is used for performing internal muscular 
work, as the beating of the heart, and external 
muscular work, as chopping wood, walking, or 
playing ball. 

Our bodies are wonderful pieces of machinery, 
far more wonderful than anything man has made. 
A variety of foods is needed to keep their intricate 
parts in normal condition. Nature, through our 
instincts, has guided us to some extent in the choice 
of foods. Her dictates were the starting point of 
our understanding of the facts about food and 
nutrition. They laid the foundation of a science 
which is rapidly developing as the result of careful 
and painstaking laboratory studies. 



HOUE DIETETICS 



meat, and also from cereals, legumes and nuts. 
Protein not only supplies nitrogen for tissue build- 
ing but may also be used as a source of energy. 
It is drawn upon for this purpose more largely if 
fats, starches, and sugars are linuted in the diet. 

The carbohydrates {starch, sugar, cellulose, 
etc.) can not supply nitrogen and so can not re- 
place the nitrogen of protein as a building material, 
but they can spare it as a source of energy. Car- 
bohydrates are obtained mainly from the vegetable 
kingdom. 

Starch is manufactured by growing plants and 
stored up in the form of tiny grains lying within 
the plant cells. We obtain the greater part of 
the starch of our diet from cereals and potatoes. 

Sugars, except lactose or milk sugar, are ob- 
tained from the vegetable kingdom. By far the 
most abundant kind in our diet is sucrose, which 
is obtained chiefly from the sugar cane, the sor- 
ghum, and the beet. 

Fats, like carbohydrates, are incapable of re- 
placing protein as a source of nitrogen for body 
building and repair. They serve as a source of 
heat and energy and have an energy value, per 
pound, aj.^ times that of protein or carbohydrates. 
We obtain them chiefly from meat, milk, eggs, and 
butter in the animal kingdom and from nuts, choc- 
olate, and olives in the vegetable kingdom. 



NTJTRIENTS 9 

The body uses food as fuel, just as the engine 
uses coal. The unit for measuring energy is the 
calorie and the fuel value of our various food mate- 
rials is therefore expressed in this term. It should 
be remembered, however, that the fuel value of 
a food is not its only value, for the body requires 
protein to supply nitrogen to build and repair tis- 
sue. It is important, therefore, to know of a given 
food not only its total fuel value but also what 
part of the fuel is in the form of protein.

STANDARD MEASUREMENTS AND 

APPLICATION 

In this and all the lessons which follow the 
recipes are based upon level measurements. 
The standard cup, which holds one-half pint, 
is used. Flour should always be sifted before it 
is measured. 

The following abbreviations are used: c. for 
cup, tb. for tablespoon, t. for teaspoon, *qt. for 
quart, pt. for pint, lb. for pound, and f.g. for 
few grains.

LESSON in— SECTION A 

MEAT AND FISH 

Meat, and the tenn is used here toindude 
poultry as well as beef, mutton, and so on, is an 
important and a very generally used source of 
protein. An ordinary serving of meat once a 
day (or a like amount divided between two or all 
three meals) is a reasonable quantity, but it does 
not follow that more is harmful. Too much meat 
in the diet, however, is not economical, since it is 
seldom a cheap source of energy, and many be- 
lieve that a large amount of meat protein imposes 
a needless tax on the digestive and excretory 
organs and may be an important contributing 
cause to intestinal putrefaction. A part of the 
supply of protein should be obtained from milk, 
eggs, legumes, etc. 

The lean portion of meat is composed of bundles 
of fibers held together by connective tissue. Al- 
bumin and gelatin are the principal proteins foimd 
in meat and they should always be considered 
when it is being prepared for food. Albumin is 
hardened by intense heat and gelatin is obtained 
from the connective tissue by long, slow applica- 
tion of heat, with moisture.

^f difference 



MEAT AND FISH I3 

Results of experiments show that there is no marked 
difference in ease of digestion of various kinds and cuts of 
meat. Over 95 per cent, of thcprotcinsandfatisdigested; 
which means that the nutrients of meat are largely used 
by the body with Httle waste. Therefore, those who wish 
to use the cheaper cuts of meat need not fear that in so 
doing their families will be less well nourished than by 
the use of more expensive cuts." C. F, Langworthy. 

As it occurs in our food the protein from meat 
is more readily digested and absorbed than the 
vegetable protein and there is reason to believe 
that it is more valuable to the body, since it is 
more like body protein in structure and so more 
readily used. 

When a muscle is exercised vigorously the con- 
nective tissue increases in amount and becomes 
hardened and the muscle is consequently hardened 
or toughened and the amount of extractives (sub- 
stances which give flavor) increased. Tough 
meats, as a rule, therefore, contain more flavor 
than the other meats. There are many good ways 
of making palatable dishes from them. The cuts 
of tough meat are usually less expensive and their 
use is economical, especially when the flavors are 
to be drawn out, as in soups and stews. The 
shank and chuck are examples of tough cuts. 

The muscles that are exercised slightly have 
softer and often more fat connective tissue and so 
are more tender. These meats make the tender

cuts, such as the tenderlom and sirloin of beef. 
They are the most expensive parts of meat and are 
commonly used for roasting and broiUng, rather 
than for the long, slow cooking desirable for 
tougher cuts. 

Some muscles have a moderate amount of exer- 
cise and lie near the muscles which are exercised 
more vigorously. They have tender fibers and a 
fair proportion of juice, and may well be used for 
boiling and roasting. The* top of the round and 
the rump are illustrations.

MEAT AND FISH 



USES OF CUTS OF BEEF 



The chuck is excellent for stews. It makes a 
very good roast and is sometimes sold as steaks. 

The ribs are sold for roasts, being cut into one, 
two, and three -rib pieces. 

The loin includes the porterhouse, sirioin, and 
tenderloin steaks. They are the choicest and 
highest priced cuts in beef. 

The rump contains the end of the hip bone and 
the joint. The fleshy part makes very good steaks 
and roasts. 

The round consists of a very juicy, lean muscle 
and contains but little bone. It is sold for roasts, 
steaks, beef tea, and beef juice. 

The shanks are cut from the fore and the hind 
legs. They are tough and contain bones and ten- 
dons. They are used for soups and stews. 

The flank is boneless and coarse-grained but 
good in flavor. It makes a good rolled roast, or 
it may be used for stews. 

The navel and clod are used for soups and stews. 

■The brisket makes a good pot roast; or it may 
be used for soups and stews. 

Fish. — Fish is an important source of protein 
and may be used in the diet very much as meat 
ia. It often contains less fat than meat and as 
has a lower fuel value, pound for pound. As a 



i6 



HOME DIETETICS 



source of fuel, therefore, lean fish, such as cod, 
might seem less economical even at a lower price 
than such cuts of beef as sirloin steak; but as a 
source of protein (the most expensive nutrient) it 
is much cheaper. The conamon practice of cook- 
ing fish with fat tends to compensate for' its low 
fuel value. 

The different kinds of fresh fish are best at thdr 
peculiar seasons. Out of season they are inferior 
in flavor and have a disagreeable odor. In choos- 
ing fish, avoid those with dull eyes, pale red gills, 
and dry or easily-loosened scales. If the flesh is 
so soft when pressed with a finger, that the inden- 
tation remains, it is unfit for use. 

Fish is often preserved by salting, smoking, or 
pickling. In these forms it can frequently be ob- 
tained more cheaply than fresh. When dried dur- 
ing the preserving process the nutrients become 
more concentrated, so that even at the same price 
per pound a given sum would buy more nutrients 
than if spent for fresh fish". Although dried fish 
is perhaps not to be recommended for very young 
children, there is no reason to suppose that when 
properly prepared it is not perfectly wholesome 
for normal adults. Good canned fish also offers 
a convenient and economical substitute for fresh 
fish or for meat. 



LESSON in— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF MEATS 

Fresh meat is firm to the touch and bright in 
color, red in the case of beef and mutton and red- 
dish pink in the case of pork and veal. The fat 
should be dry enough to crumble easily, and, in 
the case of beefj should be of a yellow color. The 
best beef is marbled with narrow lines of fat. 
When received from the market, meat should be 
taken from the paper and wiped thoroughly with a 
damp cloth. It should be covered and put in a 
cool place. 

Tender meats should be cooked in their own 
juices to preserve the flavor. The juice may be 
kept in by hardening the albumin on the outside 
by means of high heat, as is the case when a broiled 
steak is put near the hot coals or a roast into a 
very hot oven. The temperature should then be 
lowered. There are three general ways of cooking 
tender meats: over hot coals, or broiling; pan 
broiling, or saut^ing; and roasting. Less com- 
monly tender meat (veal cutlet or chicken, for 
example,) is fried, either plain or crumbed, in deep 
fat. 



1 8 HOME DIETETICS 



METHODS OF COOKING TENDER MEATS 



;. — ^Place the meat on a greased broiler 
over hot coals or under the gas flame. Quickly 
sear over both sides to retain the juices; continue 
to turn often. Steak i inch thick will be cooked 
rare in 5 minutes, and well done in 6 minutes. 
There is a difference of opinion as to the best time 
to season broiled meat. If the seasonings are 
added before the broiling they penetrate the meat 
more thoroughly, but, on the other hand, the salt 
tends to draw out the juices. It is therefore better 
to add the seasonings at the end, to prevent waste 
of material. 

Pan Broiling. — Have the frying pan very hot 
and then grease it over with a small amount of 
fat. Bits of suet may be used for this purpose. 
Sear the meat over on both sides; then cook more 
slowly, turning the meat often. When sufficiently 
cooked, remove to a hot platter and serve. 

A thick brown sauce or gravy may be made by 
stirring floiu: smoothly into the fat in the pan and 
then gradually adding hot water, stirring all the 
time. The method and proportions are the same 
as used in making white sauce. (See p. 52.) 

Roasting. — Season the meat and dredge with 
flour. The starch grains of the floiu: imder the 
influence of heat will form a pasty covering which 



I 

1 

I 



COOKERY OF MEATS IQ 

will aid in retaining the juices of the meat. Place 
xmcovered on the grate in the oven of a coal range 
or in a hot gas range, and sear over, turning with 
a fork until the searing is complete. Then pour 
in at the side enough hot water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan and place the pan on the bottom 
of the oven, if a coal range is used. The meat 
should be frequently basted. A covered roasting 
pan is very desirable. The water is then poured 
into the lower pan after the meat is seared over 
and the cover put on. Basting is then unneces- 
sary, as the steam will keep the meat moist. 
Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat and, 
if the roast is more than 4 pounds, fifteen minutes 
more for the heat to penetrate. Brown sauce may 
be made in the pan after the roast is removed. 

METHODS OF COOKING TOUGH MEATS 

The principle followed in cooking tough meats 
is to cook slowly at not too high a temperature 
keeping the meat moist. Pot roasting, stewing 
and casserole cooking are examples. 

Pot Roast. — Tough cuts are used for pot roasts. 
The meat should be put into boiling water and 
boiled for ten minutes until the albumin is hard- 
ened on the outside, to retain the juices. Season- 
ings should then be added and the meat cooked 



20 HOME DIETETICS 

slowly until it is tender. The latter process can 
be carried out very successfully in a fireless cooker. 
K desired, the roast may be browned in the kettle 
by letting the water simmer away. When the 
roast is removed a brown sauce may be made in 
the regular way. K the meat is' removed before 
browning and a sauce made in which the roast is 
cooked, it is necessary to stir the flour until free 
from lumps in a small portion of water before 
adding it. 

Soup. — If soup is desired the meat should be 
placed in cold water and brought to the simmering 
point. Cook slowly until the fibers fall apart 
and seem tasteless. A good order for soup stock 
consists of four pounds of soup meat beef; one 
knuckle of veal, well broken; and one pound of 
marrow bone. In ordering any kind of meat ask 
that the trimmings and bones be sent, as they may 
be used to replenish the soup stock. 

Stewed Meats. — In stewing meats we have, a 
two-fold purpose; that is, to keep part of the 
juices in to retain the flavor of the meat, and to 
extract part of the juices to flavor the gravy. 
This may be accomplished by putting the meat into 
cold water and quickly bringing it to the boiling 
point. It should then be cooked slowly until 
tender.

LESSON R^— SECTION A 

MILK AND EGGS 

Milk and ^gs are extremdy impcutant foods, 
particularly in the diet of the young and of in- 
valids. Eggs contain only a trace of carbohy- 
drate. Milk contains milk sugar but no starch. 
In general, neither needs cooking except to make 
it more palatable, and in the case of milk, to lessen 
the danger from harmful bacteria. As ^gs and 
milk, like meat, contain much protein as com- 
pared with other nutrients, cooking at a low tem- 
perature is desirable so that they may be soft and 
under, rather than over-cooked. 

Great care should be used in handling milk. 
We should demand that it be forwarded and 
delivered to us in a sanitary condition. The 
milk bottle should be carefully washed before the 
cover is removed. The milk may be left in the 
bottle until used, or, if preferred, poured into a 
freshly scalded and covered vessel. It should be 
set in a cool, clean place, free from dirt, flies, etc. 
If left at a temperature of 50*^ F. or less, good milk 
should remain sweet for twenty-four hours or 
more.

Much of the milk sold by dealers is pasteurized. 
This is to be distinguished from sterilized milk. 
Pasteurization is accomplished by bringing milk 
to a temperature of 60° to 65° C, (140° to 149° F.) 
and holding it there for twenty minutes. Steril- 
izing milk means boiling it for a certain length of 
time or heating it nearly to the boihng point, allow- 
ing it to stand for some hours, and again heating 
it, repeating the operation several times. Boiled 
milk is very difficult for children to digest. Pas- 
teurized milk is preferable to boiled milk for this 
reason. It should not be necessary to depend on 
sterilizing or pasteurizing as a means of providing 
germ-free milk. The milk should be produced 
under clean conditions, even if it is to be pas- 
seurized. Where there is any doubt as to the 
tanitary quality of the milk, it should be pasteur- 
ized. Pasteurized milk is much better for chil- 
dren than raw milk of questionable quahty. It 
is the opinion of many authorities that babies fed 
on pasteurized milk thrive fully as well as those 
fed on raw milk. 

Eggs spoil because of the action of bacteria 
which are either included in them before they are 
laid, or, less often, enter later through the pores 
of the shell. Eggs should be kept in a cool, clean 
place. 

During the season when eggs are plentiful it is 



26 HOME DIETETICS 

economical to buy a supply and preserve them. 
The best method of preservation is by the use of 
water glass, which may be obtained at a drug 
store and diluted with water in the proportion of 
one part of water glass* to five parts of pure water. 
Place the eggs in a clean stone jar and pour in the 
solution, leaving two inches of the liquid covering 
the top layer of eggs, and set in a cold place. 

Only clean, fresh eggs should be preserved. A 
good, fresh egg has a rough, dull shell and should 
not be smooth and shiny. K you are in doubt as 
to the freshness of eggs, candle them or see whether 
they sink when placed in a dish of fresh water. 
If an egg sinks it is reasonably fresh.

LESSON V— SECTION A 
tEREALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 

The cereals represent a fairly complete food, 
that is, one in which all the food principles are 
represented in good proportions. They are grown 
in all parts of the world except the arctic regions 
and therefore form staple foods of all countries. 
They are widely grown, easily stored in good con- 
dition, usable in many ways, may be readily 
prepared for the table, and are palatable and 
digestible. 

A study of the table shows that the cereals vary 
as to the proportion of nutrients but that carbo- 
hydrates predominate in all grains. The carbo- 
hydrates are mainly in the form of starch and this 
determines the general method of cereal cookery. 
The starch grains are stored up in cells whose 
walls are a tough cellulose. High temperature and 
long continued cooking are necessary to break down 
the cell walls and to free the starch grains so that 
they may be acted upon by the digestive juices. 

The cereals are prepared for the table in a great 
variety of ways. Wheat, com, and rye are the 



r 

I 



32 CEREALS — GEKEKAL DISCUSSION 

grains which are most frequently ground into flour 
and used for breads. Buckwheat is used for 
griddle cakes. Served with gTa\-y or butter and 
gyrup, buckwheat cakes are high in energy value. 
Rice is a valuable food and may well be used fre- 
quently as a vegetable or prepared as a dessert. 
Among the cereals used for breakfast foods, oats 
are very valuable. Oatmeal is not only highly 
nutritious but it gives bulk which is necessary for 
digestion and excretion. 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixtures are divided into two chief 
classes— batters and doughs. Each class may be 
subdivided. A batter may be made of one part 
liquid to one part of flour, and is then termed a 
thin batter; or, it may be made in the proportion 
of one part of liquid to two parts of flour and then 
forms a thick batter. A dough made in the pro- 
portion of one part liquid to three of flour is called 
a soft dough; and if the proportion is one part 
liquid to more than three of flour, it is then a stiflt 
dough. Griddle cakes, popovers, and ginger 
bread are types of thin batter. Cakes come under 
the head of thick batters, and the proportions 
should be kept in mind when a new recipe is being 
considered. The breads and pastry come under 



HOMB DIETETICS 33 

the soft doughs, while cookies and crullers are 
stiff dough. 

Flour mixtures are raised or made light by means 
of leavens. The leavens most commonly used in 
bread making and for similar purposes are steam, 
air, and carbon di-oxide. The carbon di-oxide 
may be due to the growth of yeast or to the action 
of chemicals such as cooking soda and cream of 
tartar. The desired results are brought about 
by the action of definite physical laws, namely: 
that water converted into steam produces a force 
which tends to expand a mixture enclosing it, and 
that air or gas (carbon di-oxide), also expands 
when heated, producing a similar result. The 
flour is sifted and the egg is beaten to catch and 
hold the tiny quantities of air which may expand 
and make the mLxture light, under the influence 
of heat during cooking. 

In using recipes for flour mixtures, remember 
that flour should always be sifted before measuring 
and that measurements should always be accurate, 
a knife being used to level off the flour at the top of 
the measuring cup or the baking powder in the tea 
spoon. If care is used there is no such thing as 
"luck" in baking; the results are always the same 
if the conditions are always the same.

LESSON V— SECTION B 

MAKING OF CAKE AND PASTRY 
CAKE MAKING 

All cakes may be classified under one of two 
headings; that is, they either contain fat and are 
then called butter cakes, or they do not contain 
fat, and are then called sponge cakes. The general 
method of handling each type is illustrated by the 
"plain cake" and the "hot water sponge cake." 
If a butter cake of very fine quality is desired, 
separate the egg, using only the beaten yolk at 
first, then fold in the beaten white just before the 
mixture is poured into the baking pan. 



GENERAL RXILES FOR BAKING 

In baking, divide the time into quarters. First 
quarter, mixture should begin to rise. 

Second quarter, mixture continues rising and 
begins to brown. 

Third quarter, mixture continues browning. 

Fourth quarter, mixture finishes baking and 
shrinks from pan. 



36 HOME DIETETICS 

Cake should often be looked at during the bak- 
ing. If the oven door is opened and closed care- 
fully there is no danger of the cake falling. 

Cake should not be moved in the oven until it 
is fully risen. After this time it may be moved 
so that it will brown evenly. 

Cake, when done, shrinks from the pan and does 
not retain indentation if pressed with the finger. 
It is wise to test with a small toothpick. If the 
toothpick comes out clean the cake is thoroughly 
done. 

Cake will crack if too much flour has been used, 
or if the oven is too hot.

PASTRY 

The use of pastry and its ease of digestion is a 
subject concerning which there is much disagree- 
ment. In general, it may be said that a tender, 
rich pastry is just as fully digested as many more 
simple foods, but a tough or "soggy" pastry may 
prove difficult of digestion. In the case of any 
digestive disorders, especially intestinal, it is wiser 
to omit pastry from the diet. 

Pastry consists of fat and starch which makes it 
a very concentrated food. It should therefore be 
considered as a substantial food rather than as a 
delicacy to be added to an akeady sufficient meal. 
More trouble comes from overeating, when pie is 
used as a dessert at a hearty meal, than from the 
indigestibility of the pastry itself. 



2& HOME DIETETICS 

The air incorporated in the mixture and the 
steam generated from the water used, are the 
leavens which make pastry light. It is necessary 
then to sift the flour, to cut in the fat, and to 
handle the dough lightly so that as much air as 
possible may become entangled in the mixture. 
If properly handled, a light, flaky product should 
always result.

LESSON VI— SECTION A 
CEREALS— BREAD MAKING 

Wheat, corn and rye are the grains most com- 
monly used m bread making. The wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making as it contains the 
gluten (a protein) in the right proportions and of 
the right nature to form a spongy loaf. Except 
for a slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a per- 
fect food and we supply the need by the addition 
of butter. Rye ranks next to wheat in importance 
for bread making, but it is best used in combina- 
tion with wheat, because alone, it makes a heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn needs to be combined 
with wheat also, for if used alone the bread is 
crumbly, owing to the lack of gluten. 

In a cross-section of wheat three distinct parts 
are found; the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. 
The outside coat or bran is fibrous material, con- 
taining valuable mineral matter, protein, and 
a pigment which gives the wheat a brown color. 
The germ is the tiny plantlet or embryo. When 
growing, the little plant needs nourishment before 

it can get to the earth; so "Mother Nature" stores

Up a supply itt the endospenn. The endosperm 
is made of irregular cells, separated by walls of 
delicate woody fiber or cellulose. Packed away 
in the cells are tiny grains of starch. The spaces

between the grains are filled principally witt" 
gluten. 

There are several varieties of wheat flour, de- 
pending upon the part of the grain used. Graham 
flour is made from the whole grain. The food 



42 



HOME DIETETICS 



value is high because of the presence of the germ 
which contains a larger portion of fat than the 
rest of the seed. For this very reason though the 
flour will not keep as the fat becomes randd. 
There is a large proportion of minerals and also of 
protein, but the protein is stored up in the coarse, 
indigestible bran; so, graham flour often has a 
slightly smaller amount of digestible protein than 
fine white flour. In whole wheat flour the oMer 

husks and the germ a re removed ; 

while in the higher grade white 
1 flours all the bran is removed; 

that is, only the endosperm is 

used. 
Pastry flour is made from 
, winter wheat, which contains 
) gluten than spring wheat, 

from which bread flour is made. 
The pastry flour is cheaper, being made from lower 
priced wheat. In using bread flour in place of 
pastry flour for cakes, etc., the general rule is to 
use two tablespoons less to a cupful. 

Fermented is the term sometimes applied to 
breads in which yeast is used as a leavening agent. 
The yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant which grows 
by the simple process known as budding. Yeast, 
like any other plant, needs light, heat, and mois- 
ture for its growth. The temperature most favor-

able is from 70° to 7S°F. If colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above 90T, 
the conditions are favorable for the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria and the bread " sours." Sugar 
feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is 
to some extent converted into sugar and thereby 
serves the same purpose. Salt retards the growth 
of the yeast somewhat, but we add it because it 
seems necessary to season the bread to our taste. 
The soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the 
yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxid. The carbon-dioxid gas becomes en- 
tangled in the gluten, and by expansion when 
heated, raises the bread. 

We begin the bread with either a sponge or 
"hard loaf," using liquid, dry, or compressed 
yeast. The compressed yeast proves very satis- 
factory, but should never be used unless light in 
color and without dark streaks. The bread should 
be kneaded thoroughly in order to incorporate the 
ingredients. It should be covered and set in a 
warm place until its bulk, is doubled. The second 
kneading breaks up the bubbles of gas, thus pre- 
venting the formation of large holes in the bread; 
and spreads the fermentation through the mixture. 
During the second kneading add as little flour as 




44 HOME DIETETICS 

possible. Shape and put into greased pans and 
again let it rise to double its bulk. 

The bread is baked to kill the ferment; to render 
the starch more soluble, and therefore, more 
digestible; to drive ofF the alcohol; to expand the 
carbon-dioxid and thus raise the mixture and 
to improve the flavor. The oven must be hot 
enough to raise the loaf to a temperature of 212^. 
The best temperature for the oven is from 400** 
to 500**. 

The bread shrinks from the pan when it is 
done, does not crack, and gives a hollow sound 
when tapped. Remove from the pan and cover 
lightly to cool.

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Breakfast cereals are spedaJOj miDed or otiher- 
wise prepared foods, some of which are partially, 
others thoroughly, cooked at the factory. The 
uncodLed cereal breakfast foods require long and 
slow cooking in order to break down the ceQ walk 
and free the stored starch grains so that they may 
be readily acted upon by the digestive juices. If 
a coal range is constantly in use the problem is 
easily met; otherwise, it is advisable to resort to a 
fireless cooker. Many forms of firdess cookers

LESSON vn— SECTION A 
MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Meats are common sources of protein and fat 
in the diet. These constituents can be and are ob- 
tained from other foods in greater or smaller pro- 
portion. Milk and eggs (see Lesson III) and 
cheese are common substitutes for meat, and so 
are the dry legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, 
etc.). Nuts are also used. 

Cheese.^— Cheese is a concentrated form of food. 
It is rich in both protein and fat. In combination 
with starchy food it may frequently be used as a 
■substitute for meat. Experiments have proved 
that cheese does not ordinarily cause indigestion 
and neither is it a frequent cause for constipation. 

Cheese should be kept wrapped in a slightly 
damp cloth or in paraffin paper and then in wrap- 
ping paper. It should be kept in a cool place. 
Never cover cheese in a dish from which the air 
has been wholly excluded, as it molds more readily 
under such conditions. 

Legumes. — Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
contain a larger percentage of protein than other 
vegetables, and a majority of these show a high 
percentage of carbohydrate. In addition the 



HOUE DIETETICS 



legumes are valuable sources of potassium, phos- 
phorus, iron, and calcium salts.

In view of the low cost and high nutritive value, 
dried legumes should be used frequently; not only 
as a meat substitute but to give a pleasing variety 
to the diet. 

Care in the preparation of legumes is very im- 
portant both as regards the digestibility and the 
flavor. The dried legumes should be soaked over 
night in water to which a little baking soda has 
been added. These vegetables require long cook- 
ing to soften the cellulose and also to develop the 
flavor. A little soda added to the water in which 
they are cooked also aids in softening the cellulose 
and neutralizes the vegetable add found in some 
of the legumes. 

Although these foods are comparatively cheap 
the fuel required to cook them so long a time may 
increase their cost unless they are prepared on a 
day when the range is being used for other pur- 
poses, as, for laundry. The iireless cooker is sat- 
isfactory in cooking these dried foods. 

Nuts. — Nuts serve as an excellent source of 
energy and may replace, to a considerable extent, 
other proteins in the diet. They are a concen- 

Itrated food and therefore need, even more than 
meat, to be accompanied by fresh vegetables or 
fruits or other watery and bulky foods. When 
added to an already hearty meal, nuts may be the 
cause of digestive disturbances.

LESSON Vin— SECTION A 
VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Vegetables, except beans, peas and other 
legumes, are usually poor in protein and fat and 
owe their nutritive value largely to carbohy- 
drates. The latter consist mainly of starch, 
cellulose, and small amoimts of sugar. They also 
contain relatively large proportions of important 
mineral nutrients. It should be remembered that 
vegetables often are more than half water and 
that their fuel value is therefore lower than might 
be supposed from their bulk. This bulk, however, 
is often useful in the diet (see p. i lo) and does not 
lessen the value of vegetables in the ordinary diet. 

In cooking, starchy vegetables should be placed 
in boiling water or in a hot oven, as the case may be, 
as experience has shown that this gives the best 
results. Vegetables should not be salted xmtil 
they have been cooking about ten minutes, be- 
cause the salt tends to draw out the juices. 

Vegetables having a sweet, mild-flavored juice, 
as string beans and green peas, should be cooked 
in a covered utensil in a small quantity of water,

which is served with the vegetable. Vegetables 
having a strong juice, as onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower, should be cooked in an uncovered 
utensil in a large quantity of water, which is not 
usually served with the vegetable but which may 
be used for soup making. In the first class, the 
purpose is to retain all the sweetness and flavor; 
in the second class, the purpose is to make the 
vegetables more palatable and less likely to cause 
digestive disturbance by modifying the flavor. 
With potatoes the matter of quantity of water is 
one of convenience chiefly. 

Great care should be taken not to overcook 
vegetables, as this injures the color and flavor and 
may make them likely to cause digestive disturb- 
ances. Cook only long enough to make them 
tender. 

Fruits. — The nutritive value of fresh fruits, in 
proportion to their bulk, is low and is due largely 
to the sugar and the mineral matters present. 
After drying, fruits are much richer than when 
fresh, dates, raisins, figs, and prunes containing 50 
to 75 per cent, of grape and other sugars. Fruits 
are valuable in the dietary chiefly because of the 
salts and acids which they contain and because of 
the bulk of water and cellulose or woody fiber. 
These things tend to stimulate digestion and ex- 
cretion and the mineral salts are important for 



58 HOME DIETETICS 

body biiilding and for other physiological purposes. 
Some dried fruits and fruit juices, like many of the 
fresh fruits, are useful for their laxative properties. 
As fruits ripen, starch and similar carbohydrates 
are changed into sugar, flavor develops, and tex- 
ture softens. As a whole, fruits are well digested. 
Stewed fruits, as a rule, are preferable to raw for 
yoxmg children because of the softening of cellulose 
during cooking and because bacteria which may be 
in the raw fruit are destroyed.

BOILED POTATO 

Wash in cold water and remove bruised or decayed places. 
If skins are removed, put the pared potatoes at once into cold 
water, so that they will not turn dark. If they are cooked with 
the skins on, more of the minera! matter just under the skin is 
retained. If potatoes vary in size, cut the larger ones in two 
pieces. Put into boiling water and cook lintil tender. The 
water should boll all the time, but not too bard. Salt at the 
end of ten minutes. When tender, drain off the water, remove 
lid, shake the saucepan gently over the stove, cover with a doth, 
and stand on the back of the stove. 

BAKED POTATO 

Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to i hour, turning once oc 
twice. When soft, break the akin, to allow the steam to escape, 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

To cream vegetables, use one cupful of cooked vegetables, cut 
into one^bolf inch cubes, to one cupful of medium-thick white 
sauce. (Seep. 51.) Heat in ovenoron topof stoveandserve 
at once. 

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream of vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable 
dish to serve at luncheon or supper. Great care should be used 
in combining add vegetables, such as tomatoes, with oulk, as

LESSON IX— SECTION A 



DIGESTION 

The process of digestion includes the changes 
which the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
before it can be absorbed into the body tissue. 
The food is taken into the mouth where it is 
ground by the teeth and mixed with the saliva. 
Some of the starchy portion is changed to sugar 
by an enzym or ferment, known as "ptyalin," 
which is present in the salivary secretion. It was 
formerly believed that this transformation of 
starch to sugar was largely accomplished in the 
mouth but it is now recognized that only a small 
portion of the starch is changed in the mouth. 
However, this does not lessen the need of thor- 
oughly chewing the food, since it is more readily 
acted upon by the other digestive fluids in the 
stomach and intestine after being finely divided 
and softened by the saliva. 

On being swallowed the food goes beyond volun- 
tary control and is carried by the action of invol- 
untary muscles through the esophagus or tube 
leading from the mouth into the stomach. 
64 



I 



DIGESTION 65 

la the stomach the food is acted upon by the 
ferments pepsin and rennin, which are present in 
the gastric juice, secreted by glands in the walls 
of the stomach. Mingled with the gastric juice 
is free hydrochloric acid, the presence of which is 
necessary to render the pepsin active. The pep- 
sin acts upon the protein components of the food 
and breaks them down into simpler soluble sub- 
stances (proteoses and peptones), which in turn 
undergo further changes in the intestine. The 
rennin causes the curdling or coagulation of the 
protein in milk and this seems to be necessary for 
the action of the pepsin. The explanation of the 
action of rennin is not definitely known, since the 
coagulated mass of miik protein must be dissolved 
again and rennin is present in the stomachs of 
animals not eating milk as a part of their normal 
diet. The ferments of the stomach have no effect 
upon the starchy portion of the food but the ac- 
tion of the ptyalin from the saliva continues for 
some time after the food reaches the stomach. 
Generally speaking, the fats in the food are not 
acted upon by the gastric ferments to any great 
extent but the cell walls which enclose the fat are 
dissolved and the fat is set free. The digestive 
changes which take place in the stomach, like the 
hydrolysis of starch in the mouth, are regarded 
as largely of a preliminary character.

HOME DIETETICS 

From the stomach the food passes into the small 
intestine through which it is propelled by the peris- 
taltic movements and where the most important 
digestive changes take place. In the intestine 
are three secretions — the bile, the pancreatic juice, 
and the secretions from the glands in the walls of 
the intestine itself. All of these secretions are 
alkaline and neutralize the acid brought in with 
the food from the stomach so that the digestive 
processes which take place in the intestine are 
carried out in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium. 

The pancreatic secretion contains an enzym 
known as "pancreatic amylase" or "amylopsin," 
which acts like the ptyalin of the saliva and com- 
pletes the transformation of the starch into sugar. 
The pancreatic secretion also contains an enzym 
known as "steapsin" or "lipase," which hydrol- 
izes the fatty portions of the food, sphtting them 
up into glycerin and fatty acids. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enzym, trypsin, which completes 
the process of breaking the protein components 
of the food down into peptones and breaks these 
peptones down still further into simpler com- 
pounds, called amino acids. 

The secretions of the intestine contain the en- 
zyms maltase, lactase, and invertase, which split 
the more complex sugars into simpler forms. 

After the various components of the food have 



DIGESTION 67 

been broken down into simpler substances they 
are absorbed through the walls of the digestive 
tract by the blood system and utilized by the 
body. Absorption begins in the stomach where 
mineral salts and some soluble peptones may be 
taken up by the blood, but most of it is done in 
the intestine*

Salads made of freah greeii vegetables have little 
nutritive value except from the dressing served on 
them and the mineral matters which they some- 
times provide. They are suitable to serve at 
dinner after a substantial course. The material 
used in them should be crisp and cold and the 
dressing should be added at the table or just be- 
fore the salad is served. 

Salads of substantial materials such as meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese, may well form the main 
coiu-se at luncheon or supper. It is quite common 
after cutting the materials in the proper shape and 
form, to mix a little oil and vinegar with them some 
time before serving, so that these may be absorbed. 
Such salads are often combined with crisp, fresh 
vegetables, wluch should be treated as described 
in the preceding paragraph. 

French dressings are more suitable for light 
salads of fruit and vegetables; and mayonnaise, 
cooked, or cream dressings for the heavier salads.

FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 

'^A dietary is tbat amoant and comfaiziatioii of 
food which will keep a persoa in foil health pro- 
vided he is normal to begin with.'' Ellai H. 
Richards. 

A dietary standard is a guide for home and 
institution management, rather than eipiessive of 
physiological requirement, as the U. S. Dq>art- 
ment of Agriculture points out. The standard 
for an individual depends upon many conditions. 
A man doing muscular work in the open air re- 
quires more food than a man leading a sedentary 
life. A man in the prime of life needs more food 
than either an older man or a boy. In general, a 
man needs more food than a woman because of his 
larger body and more vigorous life. Individuality 
plays an important part in choosing food for a 
partictilar person. A person may like this or 
that and refuse to touch what he does not like. 
This is largely the result of training. A child 
sliould be taught to eat a variety of foods, includ- 
ing fruits and vegetables. Climate and season

affect the appetite. In cold weather more heat- 
producing foods are needed, provided a person 
spends much time out of doors. 

Scientists have estimated that as a general rule 
a man at active work needs about 3000 calories of 
food per day; that a woman needs about 2400 
calories per day; that a boy from ten to six- 
teen years of age needs 2400 to 2700 calories 
of food per day. If very active, as he is when 
playing football or other active games, or at 
work, the boy needs a diet with much higher 
energy value — 3000 or 4500 calories, even. A 
girl from ten to sixteen years of age needs from 
1800 to 2400 calories per day. A younger child 
needs from 900 to 1500 calories per day. The pro- 
tein is less definitely determined than the energy, 
but 80 to 100 grams for 3000 calories of energy is a 
generally accepted figure. The dietary standard, 
to be consistent, should include figures for mineral 
matter, but these are difficult to give. It is gen- 
erally assumed, therefore, that a mixed diet 
including milk and vegetables and supplying 3000 
calories per day will provide the needed mineral 
matter. 

These figures express amounts of food, which 
seem rather difficult to understand, but when, in 
addition, the proportion of nutrients is considered, 
the problem is difficult. It is not possible for the

average housewife to attempt to make accurate 
dietetic calculations. In fact, after the calcula- 
tions were made it would be necessary to see that 
each individual at the table had his particular 
portion if he were to have a so-called "balanced 
ration." 

The problem has been simplified by Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, and the preceding table with the 
suggestions for its use are based upon his work. 

"The division must be more or less arbitrary, 
for some foods could go almost equally well in two 
or more groups. Thus milk, which is a general 
food, is included with the protein foods because 
it is a valuable source of this nutrient." Potatoes 
contain a large percentage of starch but their 
value for minerals has been used to determine their 
grouping. 

To obtain a fair estimate of the amount of food 
required by an individual, the approximate loo 
calorie portions may be used. Suppose John is an 
adult at active work. He needs about 3000 
calories of food. His meals may consist of the 
following menus, and thissingle illustration which 
can not be said to represent an unusually generous 
diet and which yet furnishes 3000 calories of 
energy, shows that people probably err in eating 
too much rather than in eating too little.

pounds, and engaged in moderately active, phys- 
ical work requires about loo grams of protein per 
day. Dr. Langworthy states that a mixed diet 
which includes the five food groups (see table p. 
74) and wliich supplies from 3000 to 3500 calories 
of energy per day almost inevitably supplies the 
needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. 
The diet is more likely to meet this requirement 
when milk is included in it, "To be more exact 
a dietary standard should also include figures 
expressing mineral requirements and require- 
ments for vitamines (regulating substances) of 
which minute amounts at least are essential. 
With present knowledge it is difficult to give such 
data. It is believed, however, that a general mixed 
diet will provide what is needed of both these."

BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 

In making oat a bfll-of-fare^ a con^eratioa of 
the various nutrients is important. Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy has snnpli&cd this part of the {^ohlem 
so that guided by the table on page 74, it is 
possible to plan meals famishing the nutrients in 
fairly accurate prapottiaDs. In using the lists 
from the table to fann menus, it is necessary that 
each group be represented, if not at every meal, at 
least once a day. '^The use of an excessive num- 
ber of food materials from any one groiq> would 
result not only in making less appetizing meals but 
an undesirable proportion of food principles." 

The natural appetite tends to protect people 

from eating too much of one kind of food. With 

a few exceptions like bread and butter, the same 

kind of food should not be served twice at the 

same meal. Bean soup followed by a main course 

including baked beans would pall the sense of 

taste. Avoid monotony. It may be convenient 

for the housewife always to serve corned beef on 

Monday, hash on Tuesday, and so on, but it 

is very undesirable as far as attractiveness is 

80

concerned. A schedule for 14 days can be much 
more safely used than one for 7 days. A knowl- 
edge of what is to be served often causes the mind 
to rebel against the food and this results in a loss 
of appetite. On the other hand, a surprise due 
to an unexpected dish stimulates the appetite. 

The market order must be carefully made out 
so that the supplies shall be at hand when the 
preparation for a meal begins. A thrifty house- 
keeper plans her meals so well that there are few 
remnants except those she definitely desires for one 
of the many palatable "left-over" dishes. It is 
cheaper to buy food in large quantities but this is 
possible only when there is a suitable place for 



The cost of food must be considered in planning 
meals. It is necessary to remember that the 
cheapest food is not always the most economical. 
If we buy a cheap cut of meat it is usually tough, 
and by the time it is cooked and the cost of the 
gas added to the first cost it may prove more 
expensive than a more tender piece. However, 
if there is a fire in the coal range, anyway, or if a 
fireless cooker is used, there is economy in the 
cheaper cut. Vegetables and fruits used out of 
season are no more nourishing than when they 
are more abundant and cheaper and they are 
an extravagance for the average family. 



82 HOME DIETETICS 

Unnecessary waste should be avoided. Some 
vegetables and fruits have to be pared, cored, etc., 
but the waste may be reduced to the minimum. 
Potatoes may be carefully scrubbed and then 
boiled, and the outside skin removed before they 
are served. The flavor is not only better but the 
valuable mineral matter is retained. Ask the 
butcher to send home the trimmings of meat. 
The bones and lean meat may be used for soup 
stock. The fat can be tried out and used for 
shortening. Chicken fat thus prepared is excel- 
lent for cake. 

Labor spent in the preparation of food should 
be considered. Is not the housewife's energy of 
some value? A mother might far better prepare 
simpler meals, even though they are somewhat 
more expensive, than to work so hard that she 
comes to the table too tired to enjoy the meal with 
her family.

SERVING FAillLY ilEALS 

In most homes some of the memb^s of the 
household are engaged in occopations which re- 
quire them to be away during the greater part 
of the day. As a result of this the meal time, 
especially at night, is the only opportunity for 
real enjoyment in the family drde. Careful 
thought should therefore be given to planning 
and furnishing the dining-room. 

It should be a room large enough to meet the 
needs of the family, with an allowance for the 
occasional guest. There should be plenty of 
windows to admit light, air, and stmshine. A 
pleasant outlook is also desirable. 

The woodwork may be painted white or stained 
and varnished to harmonize with the furniture. 
The walls should be covered with a simple, plain 
paper which harmonizes with the rug and the 
furniture. The ceiling should be lightest in 
tone, the walls medium, and the rug darkest. 
A dark, cold room needs a warm toned paper, 
say one of yellow-brown, while a gray green or 
blue may be used on a warm, sunny room. A

riew pictures may be used, but a plate rail or any 
other "dust catcher" is undesirable. 
Direct artificial light which produces a glare 
is unpleasant in its effects. Either side lights or 
the modern indirect lighting is much better. The 
window curtains should be of a soft, simple 
material, such as muslin or scrim. The curtains 
are pleasing and they are also more sanitary if 
they are fastened to a small rod and then allowed 
to hang in straight folds which just clear the 
window sill. If more light is needed or if there 
is a beautiful outlook, slide the curtains from the 
center and fill the gap at the top with a piece of 

I the curtain which is nine to twelve inches in length. 
Have only such furniture in the room as is 
really necessary. A table, chairs, and a sideboard 
or serving table are sufficient. It should be simple 
but substantial. Furniture which is made along 
plain lines and without ornamentation is in good 
taste. Choose chairs which have the lines of the 
back following the curve of the human body, as 
they will be much more comfortable. 

The linen should be simple in design and should 

be of good quality. There is no economy in 

buying cheap linen. The china, glass, and silver 

are also in better taste if they are either perfectly 

._ plain or are decorated near the edge with a simple, 

H conventional design. Avoid gilt on cheap dishes. 



So HOME DIETETICS 

A table doth may be used with propriety at 
any meal, but doilies are permissible for break- 
fast and luncheon. When a cloth is used, a 
silence cloth of asbestos or canton flannel should 
be placed on the table hrst. This not only dulls

sounds but serves to protect the table. The 
table cloth should be placed on the table with the 
long fold lengthwise. A small, low growing plant 
or a few cut flowers give a touch of beauty to the 
table. A simple white doily may be used under 
the dish holding the plant. 



SERVING I'AHILY UEALS 89 

Only the silver, glass, and china needed should 
be placed upon the table. They should be ar- 
ranged as indicated on the diagram. The stiver 
is placed in order of use from the outside toward 
the plate; that is, a soup spoon should be placed 
still farther to the right if soup is to be the first 
course. 

With a simple home service it is important that 
all the food, dishes, etc., needed for a particular 
course, be on the table. Hot food should be 
served on hot dishes and cold food should be served 
on cold dishes. A wheel tray is convenient for 
such a service, and every woman doing her own 
work should not only own one, but should learn 
to use it. A very satisfactory wagon can be made 
by fastening a wooden tray upon the wheels of an 
old baby carriage.

FOOD FOR CS'F.\XTS AXD YOUNG 

CHILDREN^ 

Each vear greater actendon is grven to tiie caie 
and feeding of infants^ so that thev may be 
properly nourished and developed into healthy 
citizens, prepared to meet the responabilities of 
life. To bring about these results the care must 
start with the birth of the child and continue 
throughout the years of growth and devdopment. 

Nature's food, mother*s milk, is most desirable 
for infants because it contains all the necessary 
nutrients in the ri^t proportions to properly 
nourish the child. No perfect substitute for 
mother^s milk has been obtained. It is necessary, 
however, to resort to artificial feeding when no 
milk is secreted, when the mother is delicate, or 
when the child does not thrive on mother's milk. 
Cow's milk is the usual substitute for mother's 
milk, but to be fed successfully to an infant it 
needs modifying to make it more nearly Hke 
mother's milk. Water may be added to it to 
reduce the protein and other nutrients; cream, to

increase the fat; milk-sugar, to increase the car- 
bohydrates; and sometimes lime water, to make 
the milk alkaline. If it becomes necessary to 
resort to artificial feeding, it is best to consult 
the family physician, who will either give a formula 
for modifying, or give directions how to obtain 
modified milk. 

In order that the infant may be healthy and 
thrive, whether breast-fed or bottle-fed, it is 
necessary not only to have the right food, but also 
to feed it regularly, to be sure that everything is 
kept in perfectly sanitary condition, to keep the 
child quiet after it is fed, and to allow it to sleep 
two or three hours after each feeding. 

After the first six or eight months, the physician 
may begin to prescribe simple gruels, etc, until 
the child can take whole milk. When the child is 
about fourteen months old, thicker cereals are some- 
times ordered. They should be thoroughly cooked 
for about three hours, and then strained. They 
may be fed from a spoon. 

I By the end of the first year the normal child 
should be taking eight or nine ounces of food at 
a time, five times a day. During the second year 
the lime water and ttii'IIc sugar may be gradually 
omitted and broth {mutton, veal, or chicken) and 
egg-white added. Orange juice and beef juice 
may also be given. 



I 



94 HOICE DEETETICS 

During the third year the child is ^ven a 
greater quantity of solids. Potatoes and other 
v^etables are introduced into the diet. 

Detailed directions for feeding infants may be 
obtained from some recognized authoritative 
book^ such as Holt's ''The Care and Feeding of 
Ouldren." 

When a child is old enough to be given solid 
foodSy it is very essential to his health that he be 
allowed plenty of time for his meals and that he 
learn to masticate his food thoroughly. Food 
should be given at regular intervals, but nothing 
between meals. The largest meal should be ^ven 
at the middle of the day, and a light supper at 
least a half-hour before bed-time. Milk may be 
given once between meals. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, 
eggs, beefsteak, mutton chops, roast lamb, and 
chicken; baked, boiled, or steamed vegetables; 
sponge cakes and lady-fingers (if not fresh) ; fruits, 
custards, jimkets, rice pudding, tapioca, or gela- 
tine; milk, water, and cocoa. 

The following foods should not be given to 
children: Dried or salted meat or fish; raw vege- 
tables; fried foods; fresh or hot breads; rich cakes, 
pastry, and rich preserves; tea, coflFee, or alcoholic 
drinks. 

It is not wise to wait until a child grows up before

teaching him good table manners. Children 
should not sit sidewise or on the edge of the chair. 
They should not put their elbows on the table. 
Warn them not to drink until they have swallowed 
the food that they may be eating. Do not let them 
lean their glasses over their nose while they are 
drinking. Teach them to eat solid food with a 
fork, taking only small portions at one time. 
Soup should be eaten quietly from the side of the 
spoon and it should be dipped away from rather 
than toward the person who is eating. Do not 
allow a child to tip dishes in order to get the last 
bit of food. When taking food from a dish in 
which it is served, the utensils supplied for that 
purpose should be used and not the child's knife, 
fork, or spoon. Children should not be allowed 
to reach across the table for food nor to reach in 
front of another person. When not in use, the 
knife and fork should be laid along the side of the 
plate and the spoon should be on the side of the 
saucer. Children should be cautioned against 
speaking when their mouths are full, keeping their 
mouths open when they are eating, or smacking 

I their lips. They should not be allowed to monop- 
olize the conversation at the table but reasonable 
questions should be answered and they should 
be encouraged to contribute to the general conver- 
sation. There should be no such thing as "com-

be checked as they appear. The problem is an 
easy one if parents are careful to observe the rules 
of good manners themselves, for children will 
become polite by imitation.

LESSON XIV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR SCHOOL 

The diet of a child is always important, as it 
determines to a large extent the physical condition 
in later life. All though school life, a constant 
supervision of the food of a child is necessary. 
Digestion and assimilation are very active; all 
parts of the body are increasing in size; the muscles 
are trained to more coordinated activity; and 
the nervous system is constantly receiving and 
storing new impressions. The body requires suflBl- 
cient food of the right kind to nourish it and to 
stimulate its activities. Investigations prove 
that many so-called backward children are dull 
because of the lack of proper nourishment. 

To keep up these body functions, to repair 
wastes of the body, and to aid in the development 
of new tissues, it is necessary to furnish liberal 
and well planned meals so arranged that they 
supply the needed mineral matters and growth- 
stimulating substances as well as protein and 
energy. Care must be taken to furnish variety 
in the food, for children in this period of unrest 
tire of a monotonous diet. Some foods may be 
chosen for flavor alone.

FOOD FOR SCHOOL lOI 

Frequently children are interested In their play 
or other activities at meal time and their bodies 
are not in proper condition to take care of the 
food eaten. Sufficient time should be required 
to prepare for meals. A child should be required 
to wash his hands and face and comb his hair 
before coming to the table. He should keep his 
mouth clean and his teeth in good condition. 
After meals children should not play or work hard 
until sufficient time has been taken for the diges- 
tion of the food. To hurry to school with no 
breakfast or an insufficient amount and kind, 
causes hunger and fatigue during the morning and 
poor work in lessons. Children should be re- 
quired to take a full breakfast, consisting of fruit, 
fresh or stewed; well cooked cereal, served with 
milk or cream and a UtUe sugar; some toast or 
day-old bread; and a drink of hot milk or cocoa. 
If the child will eat more, soft-cooked eggs may 
be added. 

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 

There is no time in the whole life history of the 
individual during which there is more urgent need 
of the materials required to build up the red blood 
cells than between the ages of twelve and sixteen. 
During this period the foundation of physical 
efficiency is laid, and the normal healthy boy or 



I04 HOME DIETETICS 

Something sweet should be included such as 
cakes, cookies, candies, dates, figs or raisins, and 
some relish such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery, 
or fresh fruit. If this can be supplemented with 
a cup of cocoa or a bowl of soup the child need 
not suffer as a result of carrying lunches to school. 

The limch time at school should be as pleasant 
a meal time as any other, and good habits in 
eating as well as good manners should be developed.

LESSON XV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR THE SICK 

An invalid is a person disabled by infinnities 
or disease. As each case has a special cause or 
causes, each must be considered separately and 
a special diet planned. In each case the person 
will benefit greatly by proper dietetic and hygienic 
treatment. 

In hospitals and among nurses and physicians 
diets for invalids are usually classified as liquid, 
soft-solid, and special. Liquid diets include milk, 
broths, beef juice, beef tea, cocoa, fruit beverages, 
barley and rice waters, gruel, and cream soups. 
In soft diets are found soft-cooked eg^, milk 
toast, custards, jellies, junkets, ice creams, and 
ices. The solid diet includes simple foods con- 
taining solid parts, such as cereals, vegetables, 
meats, fruits, desserts (except pastry and rich 
cakes), and eggs in all forms except hard-boiled. 
Special diets are usually planned with particular 
reference to the pecuhar condition of the patient 
and are especially prescribed by the physician. 

In preparing dietaries for invalids only a few 
general directions can be given, as each person 
needs certain foods, depending upon the disease. 



to8 



HOME DIETETICS 



the constitution, surroundings, etc. The doctor 
should prescribe the diet the patient may have, 
and the nurse must follow his directions to the 
letter, giving the food in the proper quantities 
and at regular intervals. It is unwise to consult 
a patient about his food if he is on a diet. If a 
patient asks for some special food, always consult 
the doctor about it before giving it to the patient. 

Before serving an invahd bathe face and hands, 
adjust pillows, and fix him in as comfortable a 
position as possible. If a regular invalid table is 
not available, a pile of books or magazines on each 
side of the patient's knees will serve as supports 
for the tray, or a table may easily be prepared 
from a wooden soap box by removing the sides 
and top. The ends will form the table legs and 
the bottom the table top. 

Great care must be exercised in preparing the 
tray. It should be of a convenient size to ac- 
commodate the menu, and should be covered with 
a clean white cloth. 

The dishes should be the most attractive avail- 
able and should be arranged in an artistic but a 
simple form, A flower adds to the appearance of 
the tray and may please the invahd. Or, a little 
surprise in the nature of a gift or a letter or a note 
from a friend may distracthisattentionso that while 
enjoying these he unconsciously enjoys his meal

or takes the nourislmient without pa3Tng much 
attention to it. 

In serving a patient, it is wise not to serve too 
many things at one time and always to serve in 
small quantities, for the patient will try to eat 
all of a small serving, while a generous serving 
may take away what little appetite he has. 
Be sure of the seasonings and temperature of the 
food and always serve hot foods hot and cold 
foods cold. When the diet is limited vary it as 
much as possible in preparation and serving. 

After the meal, the tray and all traces of the 
meal should be removed. 

If the patient's appetite is poor it may some- 
times be stimulated by giving fruit beverages, 
beef tea, and oysters. These in themselves have 
but little food value but tend to increase the 
flow of the digestive juices, and these in turn create 
a desire for food. 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked and 
toast should be crisp all through, not just browned 
on the outside. It may be softened with hot milk 
or water. 

Milk and eggs form the main articles in an in- 
valid's diet, and can be served in a variety of ways. 
Gelatines and ices furnish an attractive means of 
serving hquid foods in solid forms, and cream 
soups add variety to milk diet. 



HOME DIETETICS 



Constipation, which is very common and which 
is frequently the source of many diseases, results 
from such causes as carelessness in attention to 
bodily functions at the proper time, lack of exer- 
cise, too little water, lack of bulk in food, lack of 
the natural laxative salts and acids of vegetables 
and fruits, improper habits in eating, or the use 
of indigestible foods. When constipation seems 
due to other than such causes a physician should 
always be consulted. 

Foods which in themselves are laxative are 
commonly of much benefit. The following are 
generally beheved to aid greatly in relieving the 
trouble: oranges, lemons, grapefruit, apples, 
prunes, figs, asparagus and other green vegetables, 
molasses, honey, ohve oil, butter, cream, oatmeal, 
whole-grain breads, bran biscuit, and buttermilk. 

Another common disease which needs dietetic 
and hygienic rather than medical treatment, is 
anemia. This disease results in an insufficient 
supply of red blood cells. It is often caused by 
improper diet, especially one lacking in foods 
containing iron; intestinal or other parasites; 
improper ventilation and clothing; lack of outdoor 
exercise; and an insufficient amount of sleep. 
In such cases a cure may be brought about by the 
use of plenty of well-cooked cereals, milk, eggs, 
simple foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables,, 



FOOD FOR THE SICK III 

and regular meals. It is better to take five light 
meals a day than three heavy meals. More seri- 
ous anemia is also known, so a physician's advice 
should be sought when anemia occurs.

INTRODUCTION 

This book is designed for general use in classes 
to be taught under the supervision of the Ameri- 
can Red Cross Nursing Service. The aim of the 
course is to give in a simple way the underljdng 
principles of cookery. These are presented in 
fifteen lessons. There are also directions for four- 
teen lessons in practical cookery. For conven- 
ience a lesson in theory will usually be followed by 
one in practical cookery. For this reason one of 
each series of lessons is placed in each chapter of 
the book, in spite of the fact that this disturbs 
somewhat the logical arrangement of the subject- 
matter. 

The individual recipes are given for convenience 
in laboratory work. They may also bemused if 
the teaching is done by the demonstration method 
unless it is desirable to prepare sufficient food to 
serve the class and then the home redpe'may be 
used. Where meals are to be prepared, the home 
recipes are to be used and it will be convenient 
to have the pupils work in groups. Lack of time 
will often prevent the preparation of all the foods 
suggested in the practical lessons. 



VI INTRODUCTION 

The equipment needed will depend upon 
whether the demonstration method of instruction 
or individual laboratory practice is adopted. In 
general, only cooking utensils are needed. 

The references given at the close of each lesson 
are confined to U. S. Government publications 
which can be obtained either free or at a nominal 
price. In cases where no price is given single 
copies may be obtained (as long as the supply 
lasts) by application to the Department from which 
they are published. If several copies of the same 
publication are desired for class use, the request 
should be made through a Member of Congress. 
When a price is mentioned, the publication may be 
purchased for that sum from the Superintendent of 
Documents, Government Printing OflElce, Washing- 
ton, D. C; remittances should be by coupons, 
postal money order, express order, or New York 
draft. 

To individual authors I may owe debts of which 
J am not aware, for my knowledge is an accumu- 
lation of material from various sources. The 
thoughts gleaned here and there have been inter- 
woven with my experience until a separation of 
that which belongs to others and that which is 
really my own seems impossible. I recognize 
clearly, though, that much of the best of my 



INTRODUCTION Vll 

material is the result of investigations made by the 
United States Government, particularly the 
Department of Agriculture. 

I wish to recognize here assistance which has 
been given me in preparing the work, by Anna G. 
Wetzel, teacher of dietetics, William Penn High 
School. Zeta B. Cundey, teacher of English, 
William Penn High School, has given me helpful 
criticism during the preparation of the manu- 
script. Dr. W. C. Rucker, Assistant Surgeon Gen- 
eral, U.S. Public Health Service, Washington, D. C, 
was kind enough to read and make useful sugges- 
tions for the last three lessons. To Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, Miss E. L. Hunt, and Miss H. W. 
Atwater, of the Office of Home Economics of the 
U. S. Department of Agriculture, I gratefully 
acknowledge my obligations for many suggestions 
and for very valuable constructive criticism.

HOME DIETETICS- 

LESSON I— SECTION A 

HYGIENE OF FOOD 

** Cleanliness is a most important consideration in cook- 
ing, for food materials may be the means of transmitting 
disease. True cleanliness must take into Skccount free- 
dom not only from what we know as "dirt" but also the 
micro-organisms which commonly accompany filth and 
dirt." 

In the world about us are hundreds of forms of 
bacteria which are invisible to the naked eye. 
They thrive best where uncleanly conditions exist. 
Decaying animal and vegetable matter is espe- 
cially conducive to their growth. Some of these 
forms are of great value to man but others are a 
menace to a healthy body. 

Flies, mosquitoes, and other insects are germ 
carriers and they should be carefully excluded 
from homes. Rats and even dogs and cats may 
spread disease. Danger also exists where dust 
collects for it may be laden with harmful forms of 
bacteria. Clean houses, clean clothing, clean 



2 HOME DIETETICS 

bodies, and clean food are then of the utmost 
importance. 

The person who prepares food should wear 
clean clothing, simple in style, which can be 
easily laundered. Woolen dresses or "cast oflf" 
finery are entirely out of place in the kitchen. 
The body should be kept clean by frequent baths, 
the hair should be neatly combed, and the nose 
and mouth should be kept in good condition. 
Special attention should be given to the hands. 
They should always be washed before handling 
food and especially after having been to the 
toilet. It is quite possible that harmful colon 
bacteria may be on the hands from just opening 
and shutting the door of the toilet. The finger 
nails should be free from dirt. Never dip any- 
thing but a clean spoon into food when tasting it. 

The dishes in which food is placed or served 
should be clean. After use they should be care- 
fully scraped and piled in an orderly manner. 
Two pans of water are necessary for washing 
dishes; one with hot, soapy water, to remove the 
grease, and the other with boiling water for rinsing. 
Remember that high heat kills germs. It is far 
better to dry dishes by allowing the water to 
drain off from them than to wipe them on dirty 
towels. If they must be drained in a dusty place, 
they should be covered. Dish towels and dish 



HYGIENE OF POOD 3 

cloths should be kept clean. Wash and rinse 
them each time after using. Frequent scalding 
is also necessary. It is better to wash the glass 
first, then the silver, and finally the china. 

Food should not be exposed to dust either in 
the home or in the market. Housekeepers should 
refuse to buy unwrapped bread, or other food 
that has been unnecessarily exposed. Wash fruit 
thoroughly before it is used. Loathsome dis- 
eases have been contracted from eating fruit 
handled carelessly or by diseased persons. Flour, 
sugar, and other foods that come in bags should be 
emptied into receptacles with tight covers. Re- 
move fresh meat from the wrapping paper, wipe 
with a clean, damp cloth, and set near the ice or 
in the safe in the cellar. Milk should be kept in 
a closed vessel and in a Cool place. The outside 
of the milk bottle should be washed before the 
bottle is opened. Butter, if purchased in wooden 
trays, should be removed imnmediately to a 
covered vessel. Frequently scald and air re- 
ceptacles in which food is kept. Sunshine kills 
germs. 

A refrigerator or a screened safe in a cellar for 
storing food should receive careful attention. 
Bits of food spilled on the shelves invite bacterial 
growth. Clean often with scalding water and 
washing soda or some other good cleaning material. 



4 HOME DIETETICS 

Keep a strainer in the sink to prevent particles 
of food from obstructing the drainage. This 
should be emptied into the garbage can after the 
dishes are scraped. Wash and rinse the strainer 
and hang it above the sink. After the dish wash- 
ing is finished, wash every part of the sink with 
soap and hot water and use a strong solution of 
washing soda at least once a week. 

Thoroughly clean and scald the garbage pail 
after it is emptied. Unless a local law prevents, 
line the garbage can with old newspapers before 
it is used again. Always keep the can tightly 
covered when in use.

LESSON II.—SECTION A 

NUTRIENTS 

The problem of nutrition is one of growing im- 
portance, not only because of the increased cost 
of food but because more and more we are coming 
to realize that a healthy body is man's greatest 
asscL* > 

Food is technically defined as anything which, 
when taken into the body, is capable of building 
or repairing tissue or furnishing energy. The 
energy is used for performing internal muscular 
work, as the beating of the heart, and external 
muscular work, as chopping wood, walking, or 
playing ball. 

Our bodies are wonderful pieces of machinery, 
far more wonderful than anything man has made. 
A variety of foods is needed to keep their intricate 
parts in normal condition. Nature, through our 
instincts, has guided us to some extent in the choice 
of foods. Her dictates were the starting point of 
our understanding of the facts about food and 
nutrition. They laid the foundation of a science 
which is rapidly developing as the result of careful 
and painstaking laboratory studies. 

5 



6 HOME DIETETICS 

The scientist has classified the substances which 
make up our foods, or the nutrients, under five 
heads: water, mineral matters (ash), protein, car- 
bohydrates, and fats. 

Water ranks as food because it enters into the 
composition of every tissue, even bones and teeth. 
It regulates the body temperature and has a part 
to play in all nervous and muscular work. It has 
been estimated that two-thirds of the material in 
the human body is water, and since water is con- 
tinually passing oflF from the body there must be 
a constant supply of it. Our foods as they are 
prepared for the table are about one-half water. 
They supply part but not all of the water needed, 
and must therefore be supplemented by drinking 
water. Since water is known to be capable of 
carrying diseases the greatest care should be taken 
to keep the supply pure. 

Mineral substances play an important part in 
building the body and in its chemical reactions. 
There are many kinds used by the system. 
Among the most important are calcium (lime) 
salts, which are needed for bone formation. They 
are found abundantly in milk, eggs, cereals, and 
vegetables. Children need a considerable amount 
of calcium salts and for this reason special atten- 
tion should be given to them in the diet. Lack 
of calcium may show itself in the form of an ab- 



i 



NUTRIENTS 7 

normal appetite for such substances as plaster, 
wood, or chalk, or in poor teeth. 

Iron is very important, for its presence in the 
hemoglobin of the blood makes oxygen-carrjdng 
possible. Iron salts are found in nearly all foods, 
but especially in beef, eggs, oatmeal and some of 
the green vegetables. 

Common salt (sodium chlorid) occurs in every 
tissue of the body except the enamel of the teeth, 
so it is important in our food. There are many 
other necessary mineral constituents, such as com- 
pounds of magnesia, sulphur, pholphorus, etc., 
and fortunately these are found in many of our 
staple foods. 

Protein supplies nitrogen for tissue building. 
All people, old and young, need it to repair tissue 
waste. The growing child, however, needs it not 
only to repair waste but also for growth. There 
are several forms of protein, varying in composi- 
tion. It is probable that the different proteins 
supply nitrogen in forms suited to different bodily 
needs, but this subject is still a matter for discus- 
sion and investigation. Safety would therefore 
seem to lie in the habitual use of a number of dif- 
ferent kinds of protein, which explains perhaps 
the general tendency of man toward a mixed diet. 
We may obtain it from the animal and also from 
the vegetable kingdom, from milk, eggs, fish and 



X 



8 HOME DIETETICS 

meat, and also from cereals, legumes and nuts. 
Protein not only supplies nitrogen for tissue build- 
ing but may also be used as a source of energy. 
It is drawn upon for this purpose more largely if 
fats, starches, and sugars are limited in the diet. 

The carbohydrates (starch, sugar, cellulose, 
etc.) can not supply nitrogen and so can not re- 
place the nitrogen of protein as a building material, 
but they can spare it as a source of energy. Car- 
bohydrates are obtained mainly from the vegetable 
kingdom. 

Starch is manufactured by growing plants and 
stored up in the form of tiny grains lying within 
the plant cells. We obtain the greater part of 
the starch of our diet from cereals and potatoes. 

Sugars, except lactose or milk sugar, are ob- 
tained from the vegetable kingdom. By far the 
most abundant kind in our diet is sucrose, which 
is obtained chiefly from the sugar cane, the sor- 
ghum, and the beet. 

Fats, like carbohydrates, are incapable of re- 
placing protein as a source of nitrogen for body 
building and repair. They serve as a source of 
heat and energy and have an energy value, per 
pound, 2]/2 times that of protein or carbohydrates. 
We obtain them chiefly from meat, milk, eggs, and 
butter in the animal kingdom and from nuts, choc- 
olate, and olives in the vegetable kingdom. 



M^^ 



NUTRIENTS 9 

The body uses food as fuel, just as the engine 
uses coal. The unit for measuring energy is the 
calorie and the fuel value of our various food mate- 
rials is therefore expressed in this term. It should 
be remembered, however, that the fuel value of 
a food is not its only value, for the body requires 
protein to supply nitrogen to build and repair tis- 
sue. It is important, therefore, to know of a given 
food not only its total fuel value but also what 
part of the fuel is in the form of protein.

LESSON III— SECTION A 

JVIEAT AND FISH ' 

Meat, and the term is used here to include 
poultry as well as beef, mutton, and so on, is an 
impof tant and a very generally used source of 
protein. An ordinary serving of meat once a 
day (or a like amount divided between two or all 
three meals) is a reasonable quantity, but it does 
not follow that more is harmful. Too much meat 
in the diet, however, is not economical, since it is 
seldom a cheap source of energy, and many be- 
lieve that a large amount of meat protein imposes 
a needless tax on the digestive and excretory 
organs and may be an important contributing 
cause to intestinal putrefaction. A part of the 
supply of protein should be obtained from milk, 
eggs, legimies, etc. 

The lean portion of meat is composed of bundles 
of fibers held together by connective tissue. Al- 
bumin and gelatin are the principal proteins found 
in meat and they should always be considered 
when it is being prepared for food. Albumin is 
hardened by intense heat and gelatin is obtained 
from the connective tissue by long, slow applica- 
tion of heat, with moisture. 

12 



MEAT AND FISH 1 3 

"Results of experiments show that there is no marked 
difference in ease of digestion of various kinds and cuts of 
meat. Over 95 per cent, of the proteins and fat is digested ; 
which means that the nutrients of meat are largely used 
by the body with little waste. Therefore, those who wish 
to use the cheaper cuts of meat need not fear that in so 
doing their families will be less well nourished than by 
the use of more expensive cuts." C. F. Langworthy. 

As it occurs in our food the protein from meat 
is more readily digested and absorbed than the 
vegetable protein and there is reason to believe 
that it is more valuable to the body, since it is 
more like body protein in structure and so more 
readily used. 

When a muscle is exercised vigorously the con- 
nective tissue increases in amount and becomes 
hardened and the muscle is consequently hardened 
or toughened and the amount of extractives (sub- 
stances which give flavor) increased. Tough 
meats, as a rule, therefore, contain more flavor 
than the other meats. There are many good ways 
of making palatable dishes from them. The cuts 
of tough meat are usually less expensive and their 
use is economical, especially when the flavors are 
to be drawn out, as in soups and stews. The 
shank and chuck are examples of tough cuts. 

The muscles that are exercised slightly have 
softer and often more fat connective tissue and so 
are more tender. These meats make the tender

HOME DIETETICS 



cuts, such as the tenderloin and sirloin of beef. 
They are the most expensive parts of meat and are 
commonly used for roasting and broiling, rather 
than for the long, slow cooking desirable for 
tougher cuts. 

Some muscles have a moderate amount of exer- 
cise and lie near the muscles which are exercised 
more vigorously. They have tender fibers and a 
fair proportion of juice, and may well be used for 
boiling and roasting. The top of the round and 
the rump are illustrations.

USES OF CUTS OF BEEF 



The chuck is excellent for stews. It makes a 
very good roast and is sometimes sold as steaks. 

The ribs are sold for roasts, being cut into one, 
two, and three-rib pieces. 

The loin includes the porterhouse, sirloin, and 
tenderloin steaks. They are the choicest and 
highest priced cuts in beef. 

The rump contains the end of the hip bone and 
the joint. The fleshy part makes very good steaks 
and roasts. 

The round consists of a very juicy, lean muscle 
and contains but little bone. It is sold for roasts, 
steaks, beef tea, and beef juice. 

The shanks are cut from the fore and the hind 
legs. They are tough and contain bones and ten* 
dons. They are used for soups and stews. 

The flank is boneless and coarse-grained but 
good in flavor. It makes a good rolled roast, or 
it may be used for stews. 

The navel and clod are used for soups and stews. 

The brisket makes a good pot roast; or it may 
be used for soups and stews. 

Fish. — Fish is an important source of protein 
and may be used in the diet very much as meat 
is. It often contains less fat than meat and so 
has a lower fuel value, pound for pound. As a 



1 6 HOME DIETETICS 

source of fuel, therefore, lean fish, such as cod, 
might seem less economical even at a lower price 
than such cuts of beef as sirloin steak; but as a 
source of protein (the most expensive nutrient) it 
is much cheaper. The common practice of cook- 
ing fish with fat tends to compensate for its low 
fuel value. 

The different kinds of fresh fish are best at their 
peculiar seasons. Out of season they are inferior 
in flavor and have a disagreeable odor. In choos- 
ing fish, avoid those with dull eyes, pale red gills, 
and dry or easily-loosened scales. If the flesh is 
so soft when pressed with a finger, that the inden- 
tation remains, it is unfit for use. 

Fish is often preserved by salting, smoking, or 
pickling. In these forms it can frequently be ob- 
tained more cheaply than fresh. When dried dur- 
ing the preserving process the nutrients become 
more concentrated, so that even at the same price 
per pound a given sum would buy more nutrients 
than if spent for fresh fish. Although dried fish 
is perhaps not to be recommended for very young 
children, there is no reason to suppose that when 
properly prepared it is not perfectly wholesome 
for normal adults. Good canned fish also offers 
a convenient and economical substitute for fresh 
fish or for meat. 



LESSON III— SECTION B 

COOKERY OF MEATS 

Fresh meat is firm to the touch and bright in 
color, red in the case of beef and mutton and red- 
dish pink in the case of pork and veal. The fat 
should be dry enough to crumble easily, and, in 
the case of beef, should be of a yellow color. The 
best beef is marbled with narrow lines of fat. 
When received from the market, meat should be 
taken from the paper and wiped thoroughly with a 
damp cloth. It should be covered and put in a 
a cool place. 

Tender meats should be cooked in their own 
juices to preserve the flavor. The juice may be 
kept in by hardening the albumin on the outside 
by means of high heat, as is the case when a broiled 
steak is put near the hot coals or a roast into a 
very hot oven. The temperature should then be 
lowered. There are three general ways of cooking 
tender meats: over hot coals, or broiling; pan 
broiling, or saut6ing; and roasting. Less com- 
monly tender meat (veal cutlet or chicken, for 
example,) is fried, either plain or crimibed, in deep 
fat.

1 8 HOME DIETETICS 

METHODS OF COOKING TENDER MEATS 

Broiling. — ^Place the meat on a greased broiler 
over hot coals or under the gas flame. Quickly 
sear over both sides to retain the juices; continue 
to turn often. Steak i inch thick will be cooked 
rare in 5 minutes, and well done in 6 minutes. 
There is a difference of opinion as to the best time 
to season broiled meat. If the seasonings are 
added before the broiling they penetrate the meat 
more thoroughly, but, on the other hand, the salt 
tends to draw out the juices. It is therefore better 
to add the seasonings at the end, to prevent waste 
of material. 

Pan Broiling. — Have the frying pan very hot 
and then grease it over with a small amount of 
fat. Bits of suet may be used for this purpose. 
Sear the meat over on both sides; then cook more 
slowly, turning the meat often. When suflSiciently 
cooked, remove to a hot platter and serve. 

A thick brown sauce or gravy may be made by 
stirring flour smoothly into the fat in the pan and 
then gradually adding hot water, stirring all the 
time. The method and proportions are the same 
as used in making white sauce. (See p. 52.) 

Roasting. — Season the meat and dredge with 
flour. The starch grains of the flour under the 
influence of heat will form a pasty covering which 



COOKERY OF MEATS I9 

will aid in retaining the juices of the meat. Place 
uncovered on the grate in the oven of a coal range 
or in a hot gas range, and sear over, turning with 
a fork until the searing is complete. Then pour 
in at the side enough hot water to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan and place the pan on the bottom 
of the oven, if a coal range is used. The meat 
should be frequently basted. A covered roasting 
pan is very desirable. The water is then poured - 
into the lower pan after the meat is seared over 
and the cover put on. Basting is then unneces- 
sary, as the steam will keep the meat moist. 
Allow fifteen minutes for each pound of meat and, 
if the roast is more than 4 pounds, fifteen minutes 
more for the heat to penetrate. Brown sauce may 
be made in the pan after the roast is removed. 

METHODS OF COOKING TOUGH MEATS 

The principle followed in cooking tough meats 
is to cook slowly at not too high a temperature 
keeping the meat moist. Pot roasting, stewing 
and casserole cooking are examples. 

Pot Roast. — Tough cuts are used for pot roasts. 
The meat should be put into boiling water and 
boiled for ten minutes until the albumin is hard- 
ened on the outside, to retain the juices. Season- 
ings should then be added and the meat cooked 



20 HOME DIETETICS 

slowly until it is tender. The latter process can 
be carried out very successfully in a fireless cooker. 
If desired, the roast may be browned in the kettle 
by letting the water simmer away. When the 
roast is removed a brown sauce may be made in 
the regular way. If the meat is removed before 
browning and a sauce made in which the roast is 
cooked, it is necessary to stir the flour until free 
from lumps in a small portion of water before 
adding it. 

Soup. — If soup is desired the meat should be 
placed in cold water and brought to the simmering 
point. Cook slowly until the fibers fall apart 
and seem tasteless. A good order for soup stock 
consists of four pounds of soup meat beef; one 
knuckle of veal, well broken; and one pound of 
marrow bone. In ordering any kind of meat ask 
that the trimmings and bones be sent, as they may 
be used to replenish the soup stock. 

Stewed Meats. — In stewing meats we have a 
two-fold purpose; that is, to keep part of the 
juices in to retain the flavor of the meat, and to 
extract part of the juices to flavor the gravy. 
This may be accomplished by putting the meat into 
cold water and quickly bringing it to the boiling 
point. It should then be cooked slowly until 
tender.

LESSON IV— SECTION A 

MILK AND EGGS 

Milk and eggs are extremely important foods, 
particularly in the diet of the young and of in- 
valids. Eggs contain only a trace of carbohy- 
drate. Milk contains milk sugar but no starch. 
In general, neither needs cooking except to make 
it more palatable, and in the case of milk, to lessen 
the danger from harmful bacteria. As eggs and 
milk, like meat, contain much protein as com- 
pared with other nutrients, cooking at a low tem- 
perature is desirable so that they may be soft and 
under, rather than over-cooked. 

Great care should be used in handling milk. 
We should demand that it be forwarded and 
delivered to us in a sanitary condition. The 
milk bottle should be carefully washed before the 
cover is removed. The milk may be left in the 
bottle until used, or, if preferred, poured into a 
freshly scalded and covered vessel. It should be 
set in a cool, clean place, free from dirt, flies, etc. 
If left at a temperature of 50° F. or less, good milk 
should remain sweet for twenty-four hours or 
more. 

24 



MILK AND EGGS 25 

Much of the milk sold by dealers is pasteurized. 
This is to be distinguished from sterilized milk. 
Pasteurization is accomplished by bringing milk 
to a temperature of 60° to 65° C. (140° to 149° F.) 
and holding it there for twenty minutes. Steril- 
izing milk means boiling it for a certain length of 
time or heating it nearly to the boiling point, allow- 
ing it to stand for some hours, and again heating 
it, repeating the operation several times. Boiled 
milk is very difficult for children to digest. Pas- 
teurized milk is preferable to boiled milk for this 
reason. It should not be necessary to depend on 
sterilizing or pasteurizing as a means of providing 
germ-free milk. The milk should be produced 
under clean conditions, even if it is to be pas- 
seurized. Where there is any doubt as to the 
tanitary quality of the milk, it should be pasteur- 
ized. Pasteurized milk is much better for chil- 
dren than raw milk of questionable quaUty. It 
is the opinion of many authorities that babies fed 
on pasteurized milk thrive fully as well as those 
fed on raw milk. 

Eggs spoil because of the action of bacteria 
which are either included in them before they are 
laid, or, less often, enter later through the pores 
of the shell. Eggs should be kept in a cool, clean 
place. ^ 

During the season when eggs are plentiful it is 



26 HOME DIETETICS 

economical to buy a supply and preserve them. 
The best method of preservation is by the use of 
water glass, which may be obtained at a drug 
store and diluted with water in the proportion of 
one part of water glass to five parts of pure water. 
Place the eggs in a clean stone jar and pour in the 
solution, leaving two inches of the liquid covering 
the top layer of eggs, and set in a cold place. 

Only clean, fresh eggs should be preserved. A 
good, fresh egg has a rough, dull shell and should 
not be smooth and shiny. If you are in doubt as 
to the freshness of eggs, candle them or see whether 
they sink when placed in a dish of fresh water. 
If an egg sinks it is reasonably fresh.

LESSON V— SECTION A 
CEREALS— GENERAL DISCUSSION 

• 

The cereals represent a fairly complete food, 
that iSy one in which all the food principles are 
represented in good proportions. They are grown 
in all parts of the world except the arctic regions 
and therefore form staple foods of all countries. 
They are widely grown, easily stored in good con- 
dition, usable in many ways, may be readily 
prepared for the table, and are palatable and 
digestible. 

Astudy of the table shows that the cereals vary 
as to the proportion of nutrients but that carbo- 
hydrates predominate in aU grains. The carbo- 
hydrates are mainly in the form of starch and this 
determines the general method of cereal cookery. 
The starch grains are stored up in cells whose 
walls are a tough cellulose. High temperature and 
long continued cooking are necessary to break down 
the cell walls and to free the starch grains so that 
they may be acted upon by the digestive juices. 

The cereals are prepared for the table in a great 
variety of ways. Wheat, com, and rye are the 

31 



32 CEREALS — GENERAL DISCUSSION 

grains which are most frequently ground into flour 
and used for breads. Buckwheat is used for 
griddle cakes. Served with gravy or butter and 
syrup, buckwheat cakes are high in energy value. 
Rice is a valuable food and may well be used fre- 
quently as a vegetable or prepared as a dessert. 
Among the cereals used for breakfast foods, oats 
are very valuable. Oatmeal is not only highly 
nutritious but it gives bulk which is necessary for 
digestion and excretion. 

FLOUR MIXTURES 

Flour mixtures are divided into two chief 
classes — batters and doughs. Each class may be 
subdivided. A batter may be made of one part 
liquid to one part of flour, and is then termed a 
thin batter; or, it may be made in the proportion 
of one part of liquid to two parts of flour and then 
forms a thick batter. A dough made in the pro- 
portion of one part liquid to three of flour is called 
a soft dough; and if the proportion is one part 
liquid to more than three of flour, it is then a stiff 
dough. Griddle cakes, popovers, and ginger 
bread are types of thin batter. Cakes come under 
the head of thick batters, and the proportions 
should be kept in mind when a new recipe is being 
considered. The breads and pastry come under 



HOME DIETETICS 33 

the soft doughs, while cookies and crullers are 
stiff dough. 

Flour mixtures are raised or made light by means 
of leavens. The leavens moat commonly used in 
bread making and for similar purposes are steam, 
air, and carbon di-oxide. The carbon di-oxide 
may be due to the growth of yeast or to the action 
of chemicals such as cooking soda and cream of 
tartar. The desired results are brought about 
by the action of definite physical laws, namely: 
that water converted into steam produces a force 
which tends to expand a mixture enclosing it, and 
that air or gas (carbon di-oxide), also expands 
when heated, producing a similar result. The 
flour is sifted and the egg is beaten to catch and 
hold the tiny quantities of air which may expand 
and make the mixture light, under the influence 
of heat during cooking. 

In using recipes for flour mixtures, remember 
that flour should always be sifted before measuring 
and that measurements should always be accurate, 
a knife being used to level off the flour at the top of 
the measuring cup or the baking powder in the tea 
spoon. If care .is used there is no such thing as 
"luck*' in baking; the results are always the same 
if the conditions are always the same.

MAKING OF CAKE AND PASTRY 

CAKE MAKING 

All cakes may be classified under one of two 
headings; that is, they either contain fat and are 
then called butter cakes, or they do not contain 
fat, and are then called sponge cakes. The general 
method of handling each type is illustrated by the 
"plain cake" and the "hot water sponge cake." 
If a butter cake of very fine quality is desired, 
separate the egg, using only the beaten yolk at 
first, then fold in the beaten white just before the 
mixture is poured into the baking pan. 

GENERAL RULES FOR BAKING 

In baking, divide the time into quarters. First 
quarter, mixture should begin to rise. 

Second quarter, mixture continues rising and 
begins to brown. 

Third quarter, mixture continues browning. 

Fourth quarter, mixture finishes baking and 
shrinks from pan. 

35 



36 HOME DIETETICS 

Cake should of ten be looked at during the bak- 
ing. If the oven door is opened and closed care- 
fully there is no danger of the cake falling. 

Cake should not be moved in the oVen until it 
is fully risen. After this time it may be moved 
so that it will brown evenly. 

Cake, when done, shrinks from the pan and does 
not retain indentation if pressed with the finger. 
It is wise to test with a small toothpick. If the 
toothpick comes out clean the cake is thoroughly 
done. 

Cake will crack if too much flour has been used, 
or if the oven is too hot.

PASTRY 

The use of pastry and its ease of digestion is a 
subject concerning which there is much disagree- 
ment. In general, it may be said that a tender, 
rich pastry is just as fully digested as many more 
simple foods, but a tough or "soggy" pastry may 
prove difficult of digestion. In the case of any 
digestive disorders, especially intestinal, it is wiser 
to omit pastry from the diet. 

Pastry consists of fat and starch which makes it 
a very concentrated food. It should therefore be 
considered as a substantial food rather than as a 
delicacy to be added to an already sufficient meal. 
More trouble comes from overeating, when pie is 
used as a dessert at a hearty meal, than from the 
indigestibility of the pastry itself. 



38 HOME DIETETICS 

The air incorporated in the mixture and the 
steam generated from the water used, are the 
leavens which make pastry Jight. It is necessary- 
then to sift the flour, to cut in the fat, and to 
handle the dough lightly so that as much air as 
possible may become entangled in the mixture. 
If properly handled, a light, flaky product should 
always result.

LESSON VI— SECTION A 
CEREALS— BREAD MAKING 

Wheat, corn and rye are the grains most com- 
monly used in bread making. The wheat flour is 
best adapted for bread making as it contains the 
gluten (a protein) in the right proportions and of 
the right nature to form a spongy loaf. Except 
for a slight deficiency in fat, wheat bread is a per- 
fect food and we supply the need by the addition 
of butter. Rye ranks next to wheat in importance 
for bread makmg, but it is best used in combina- 
tion with wheat, because alone, it makes a heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn needs to be combined 
with wheat also, for if used alone the bread is 
crumbly, owing to the lack of gluten. 

In a cross-section of wheat three distinct parts 
are found; the bran, the endosperm, and the germ. 
The outside coat or bran is fibrous material, con- 
taining valuable mineral matter, protein, and 
a pigment which gives the wheat a brown color. 
The germ is the tiny plantlet or embryo. When 
growing, the little plant needs nourishment before 

it can get to the earth; so "Mother Nature'* stores 

40 



CEREALS — ^BRZAD MAKING 4I 

up a~supply in the endosperm. The endosperm 
is made of irregular cells, separated by waHs of 
delicate woody fiber or cellulose. Packed away 
in the cells are tiny grains of starch. The spaces 



Fio. 3. — Cboss-sechon QV Wheat. 

between the grains are filled principally with 
gluten. 

There are several varieties of wheat flour, de- 
pendingupon thepartof-thegrainused. Graham 
flour is made from the whole grain. The food 



42 HOME DIETETICS 

value is high because of the presence of the germ 
which contains a larger portion of fat than the 
rest of the seed, For this very reason though the 
flour will not keep as the fat becomes rancid. 
There is a large proportion of minerals and also of 
protein, but the protein is stored up in the coarse, 
indigestible bran; so, graham flour often has a 
slightly smaller amount of digestible protein than 
fine white flour. In whole wheat flour the outer 

husks and the germ are removed ; 

while in the higher grade white 

flours all the bran is removed; 

that is, only the endosperm is 

used. 
Pastry flour is made from 

winter wheat, which contains

pastry flour for cakes, etc., the general rule is to 
use two tablespoons less to a cupful. 

Fermented is the term sometimes applied to 
breads in which yeast is used as a leavening agent. 
The yeast is a tiny, microscopic plant which grows 
by the simple process known as budding. Yeast, 
like any other plant, needs light, heat, and mois- 
ture for its growth. The temperature most favor- 




CEREALS — BREAD MAKING 43 

able is from 70*^ to 7S°F. If colder than this, its 
growth may be retarded altogether. Above qg^F. 
the conditions are favorable for the growth of 
lactic acid bacteria and the bread " sours." Sugar 
feeds the yeast; so when added to the sponge it 
hastens the growth. The starch of the flour is 
to some extent converted into sugar and thereby 
serves the same purpose. Salt retards the growth 
of the yeast somewhat, but we add it because it 
seems necessary to season the bread to our taste. 
The soluble carbohydrates are acted upon by the 
yeast and converted into alcohol and carbon- 
dioxid. The carbon-dioxid gas becomes en- 
tangled in the gluten, and by expansion when 
heated, raises the bread. 

We begin the bread with either a sponge or 
"hard loaf," using liquid, dry, or compressed 
yeast. The compressed yeast proves very satis- 
factory, but should never be used unless light in 
color and without dark streaks. The bread should 
be kneaded thoroughly in order to incorporate the 
ingredients. It should be covered and set in a 
warm place until its bulk is doubled. The second 
kneading breaks up the bubbles of gas, thus pre- 
venting the formation of large holes in the bread; 
and spreads the fermentation through the mixture. 
During the second kneading add as little flour as 



44 HOME DIETETICS 

possible. Shape and put into greased pans and 
again let it rise to double its bulk. 

The bread is baked to kill the ferment; to render 
the starch more soluble, and therefore, more 
digestible; to drive off the alcohol; to expand the 
carbon-dioxid and thus raise the mixture and 
to improve the flavor. The oven must be hot 
enough to raise the loaf to a temperature of 2i2°F. 
The best temperature for the oven is from 400*^ 
to 500°. 

The bread shrinks from the pan when it is 
done, does not crack, and gives a hollow sound 
when tapped. Remove from the pan and cover 
lightly to cool.

BREAKFAST CEREALS 

Breakfast cereals are specially milled or other- 
wise^prepared foods, some of which are partially, 
others thoroughly, cooked at the factory. The 
uncooked cereal breakfast foods require long and 
slow cooking in order to break down the cell walls 
and free the stored starch grains so that they may 
be readily acted upon by the digestive juices. If 
a coal range is constantly in use the problem is 
easily met; otherwise, it is advisable to resort to a 
fireless cooker. Many forms of fireless cookers

are on the market, but it is easy to make one at 
home if one understands the principle.^ 

Look cereal over carefully, removing any bits 
of paper from the container or other foreign sub- 
stance, if found. Stir the required amount of 
cereal gradually into the required amount of boil- 
ing salted water. Boil, stirring constantly, un- 
til it begins to thicken. Complete the cooking by 

steaming.

LESSON VII— SECTION A 
MEAT STJBSTITUTES 

Meats are common sources of protein and fat 
in the diet. These constituents can be and are ob- 
tained from other foods in greater or smaller pro- 
portion. Milk and eggs (see Lesson III) and 
cheese are common substitutes for meat, and so 
are the dry legumes (beans, peas, lentils, peanuts, 
etc.). Nuts are also used. 

Cheese. — Cheese is a concentrated form of food. 
It is rich in both protein and fat. In combination 
with starchy food it may frequently be used as a 
substitute for meat. Experiments have proved 
that cheese does not ordinarily cause indigestion 
and neither is it a frequent cause for constipation. 

Cheese should be kept wrapped in a slightly 
damp cloth or in paraffin paper and then in wrap- 
ping paper. It should be kept in a cool place. 
Never cover cheese in a dish from which the air 
has been wholly excluded, as it molds more readily 
under such conditions. 

Legumes. — ^Beans, peas, cowpeas, and lentils 
contain a larger percentage of protein than other 
vegetables, and a majority of these show a high 
percentage of carbohydrate. In addition the 

49

legumes are valuable sources of potassium, phos-

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 5 1 

In view of the low cost and high nutritive value, 
dried legumes should be used frequently; not only 
as a meat substitute but to give a pleasing variety 
to the diet. 

Care in the preparation of legumes is very im- 
portant both as regards the digestibility and the 
flavor. The dried legimies should be soaked over 
night in water to which a little baking soda has 
been added. These vegetables require long cook- 
ing to soften the cellulose and also to develop the 
flavor. A little soda added to the water in which 
they are cooked also aids in softening the cellulose 
and neutralizes the vegetable acid found in some 
of the legumes. 

Although these foods are comparatively cheap 
the fuel required to cook them so long a time may 
increase their cost unless they are prepared on a 
day when the range is being used for other pur- 
poses, as, for laundry. The fireless cooker is sat- 
isfactory in cooking these dried foods. 

Nuts. — Nuts serve as an excellent source of 
energy and may replace, to a considerable extent, 
other proteins in the diet. They are a concen- 
trated food and therefore need, even more than 
meat, to be accompanied by fresh vegetables or 
fruits or other watery and bulky foods. When 
added to an already hearty meal, nuts may be the 
cause of digestive disturbances.

LESSON Vin— SECTION A 

VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 

Vegetables, except beans, peas and other 
legumes, are usually poor in protein and fat and 
owe their nutritive value largely to carbohy- 
drates. The latter consist mainly of starch, 
cellulose, and small amounts of sugar. They also 
contain relatively large proportions of important 
mineral nutrients. It should be remembered that 
vegetables often are more than half water and 
that their fuel value is therefore lower than might 
be supposed from their bulk. This bulk, however, 
is often useful in the diet (see p. i lo) and does not 
lessen the value of vegetables in the ordinary diet. 

In cooking, starchy vegetables should be placed 
in boiling water or in a hot oven, as the case may be, 
as experience has shown that this gives the best 
results. Vegetables should not be salted until 
they have been cooking about ten minutes, be- 
cause the salt tends to draw out the juices. 

Vegetables having a sweet, mild-flavored juice, 
as string beans and green peas, should be cooked 
in a covered utensil in a small quantity of water, 

s6 



VEGETABLES AND FRUITS 57 

which is served with the vegetable. Vegetables 
having a strong juice, as onions, cabbage, and 
cauliflower, should be cooked in an uncovered 
utensil in a large quantity of water, which is not 
usually served with the vegetable but which may 
be used for soup making. In the first class, the 
purpose is to retain all the sweetness and flavor; 
in the second class, the purpose is to make the 
vegetables more palatable and less likely to cause 
digestive disturbance by modif3dng the flavor. 
With potatoes the matter of quantity of water is 
one of convenience chiefly. 

Great care should be taken not to overcook 
vegetables, as this injures the color and flavor and 
may make them likely to cause digestive disturb- 
ances. Cook only long enough to make them 
tender. 

Fruits. — The nutritive value of fresh fruits, in 
proportion to their bulk, is low and is due largely 
to the sugar and the mineral matters present. 
After drymg, fruits are much richer than when 
fresh, dates, raisins, figs, and prunes containing 50 
to 75 per cent, of grape and other sugars. Fruits 
are valuable in the dietary chiefly because of the 
salts and acids which they contain and because of 
the bulk of water and cellulose or woody fiber. 
These things tend to stimulate digestion and ex- 
cretion and the mineral salts are important for 



S8 HOME DIETETICS 

body building and for other physiological purposes. 
Some dried fruits and fruit juices, like many of the 
fresh fruits, are useful for their laxative properties. 
As frmts ripen, starch and similar carbohydrates 
are changed into sugar, flavor develops, and tex- 
ture softens. As a whole, fruits are well digested. 
Stewed fruits, as a rule, are preferable to raw for 
young children because of the softening of cellulose 
during cooking and because bacteria which may be 
in the raw fruit are destroyed.

LESSON VIII— SECTION B 
COOKERY OF VEGETABLES 

BOILED POTATO 

Wash in cold water and remove bruised or decayed places. 
If skins are removed, put the pared potatoes at once into cold 
water, so that they will not turn dark. If they are cooked with 
the skins on, more of the mineral matter just under the skin is 
retained. If potatoes vary in size, cut the larger ones in two 
pieces. Put into boiling water and cook until tender. The 
water should boil all the time, but not too hard. Salt at the 
end of ten minutes. When tender, drain off the water, remove 
iid, shake the saucepan gently over the stove, cover with a cloth, 
and stand on the back of the stove. 

BAKED POTATO 

Bake in a hot oven from 45 minutes to i hour, turning once or 
twice. When soft, break the skin, to allow the steam to escape, 
and serve at once. 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

To cream vegetables, use one cupful of cooked vegetables, cut 
into one-half inch cubes, to one cupful of medium-thick white 
sauce. (Seep. 52.) Heat in oven or on top of stove and serve 
at once. 

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream of vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable 
dish to serve at limcheon or supper. Great care should . be used 
in combining add vegetables, such as tomatoes, with milk, as 

61 



62 HOME DIETETICS 

the milk may curdle and spoil the texture of the dish. A very 
small quantity of soda added to the pur6e (strained vegetable 
pidp) will neutralize the acid and then it may be added to the 
milk. 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

Cook vegetables until soft. Strain the vegetables and keep 
the stock in which they are cooked. 

Make a thin white sauce, using i tb. butter, i tb. flour, ^ t. 
salt, and J^ t. pepper, to i c. liquid (milk or stock, or part of 
each). 

Add the strained vegetable (pur6e) to the white sauce, then 
reheat and serve at once. 

Onion or, other seasoning vegetable may be cooked with the 
vegetables and discarded just before straining. 

TOMATO BISQUE 
Equal quantities thin white sauce and tomata pur6e.

glowly to the sauce, stirring constantly. Reheat but do not boil 
after materials are blended. Note: — If stronger flavor is liked, 
double the quantity of tomato.

LESSON IX— SECTION A 

DIGESTION 

The process of digestion includes the changes 
which the food undergoes in the digestive tract 
before it can be absorbed into the body tissue. 
The food is taken into the mouth where it is 
ground by the teeth and mixed with the saliva. 
Some of the starchy portion is changed to sugar 
by an enzjrm or ferment, known as "ptyalin," 
which is present in the salivary secretion. It was 
formerly believed that this transformation of 
starch to sugar was largely accomplished in the 
mouth but it is now recognized that only a small 
portion of the starch is changed in the mouth. 
However, this does not lessen the need of thor- 
oughly chewing the food, since it is more readily 
acted upon by the other digestive fluids in the 
stomach and intestine after being finely divided 
and softened by the saliva. 

On being swallowed the food goes beyond volun- 
tary control and is carried by the action of invol- 
untary muscles through the esophagus or tube 
leading from the mouth into the stomach. 

64 



DIGESTION 65 

In the stomach the food is acted upon by the 
ferments pepsin and rennin, which are present in 
the gastric juice, secreted by glands in the walls 
of the stomach. Mingled with the gastric juice 
is free hydrochloric acid, the presence of which is 
necessary to render the pepsin active. The pep- 
sin acts upon the protein components of the food 
and breaks them down into simpler soluble sub- 
stances (proteoses and peptones), which in turn 
undergo further changes in the intestine. The 
rennin causes the curdling or coagulation of the 
protein in milk and this seems to be necessary for 
the action of the pepsin. The explanation of the 
action of rennin is not definitely known, since the 
coagulated mass of milk protein must be dissolved 
again and rennin is present in the stomachs of 
animals not eating milk as a part of their normal 
diet. The ferments of the stomach have no effect 
upon the starchy portion of the food but the ac- 
tion of the ptyalin from the saliva continues for 
some time after the food reaches the stomach. 
Generally speaking, the fats in the food are not 
acted upon by the gastric ferments to any great 
extent but the cell walls which enclose the fat are 
dissolved and the fat is set free. The digestive 
changes which take place in the stomach, like the 
hydrolysis of starch in the mouth, are regarded 
as largely of a preliminary character. 



66 HOME DIETETICS 

From the stomach the food passes into the small 
intestine through which it is propelled by the peris- 
taltic movements and where the most important 
digestive changes take place. In the intestine 
are three secretions — the bile, the pancreatic juice, 
and the secretions from the glands in the walls of 
the intestine itself. All of these secretions are 
alkaline and- neutralize the acid brought in with 
the food from the stomach so that the digestive 
processes which take place in the intestine are 
carried out in a slightly alkaline or neutral medium. 

The pancreatic secretion contains an enzym 
known as "pancreatic amylase" or "amylopsin," 
which acts like the ptyalin of the saliva and com- 
pletes the transformation of the starch into sugar. 
The pancreatic secretion also contains an enzym 
known as "steapsin" or "lipase," which hydrol- 
izes the fatty portions of the food, splitting them 
up into glycerin and fatty acids. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enzym, trypsin, which completes 
the process of breaking the protein components 
of the food down into peptones and breaks these 
peptones down still further into simpler com- 
pounds, called amino acids. 

The secretions of the intestine contain the en- 
zjrms maltase, lactase, and invertase, which split 
the more complex sugars into simpler forms. 

After the various components of the food have 



DIGESTION 67 

been broken down into simpler substances they 
are absorbed through the walls of the digestive 
tract by the blood system and utilized by the 
body. Absorption begins in the stomach where 
mineral salts and some soluble peptones may be 
taken up by the blood, but most of it is done in 
the intestine.

SALADS 

Salads. — Salads give a pleasing variety to the 
diet and if well prepared are both wholesome and 
palatable. They are made in a great variety of 
ways and may be composed of meat, fish, vege- 
tables, and fruit, either alone or in combination. 

68 



COOKERY OF FRUITS AND MAKING OF SALADS 69 

Salads made of fresh greeji vegetables have little 
nutritive value except from the dressing served on 
them and the mineral matters which they some- 
times provide. They are suitable to serve at 
dinner after a substantial course. The material 
used in them should be crisp and cold and the 
dressing should be added at the table or just be- 
fore the salad is served. 

Salads of substantial materials such as meat, 
fish, eggs, and cheese, may well form the main 
course at luncheon or supper. It is quite common 
after cutting the materials in the proper shape and 
form, to mix a little oil and vinegar with them some 
time before serving, so that these may be absorbed. 
Such salads are often combined with crisp, fresh 
vegetables, which should be treated as described 
in the preceding paragraph. 

French dressings are more suitable for light 
salads of fruit and vegetables; and mayonnaise, 
cooked, or cream dressings for the heavier salads.

LESSON X—SECTION A 

FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 

"A dietary is that amount and combination of 
food which will keep a person in full health pro- 
vided he is normal to begin with." Ellen H. 
Richards. 

A dietary standard is a guide for home and 
institution management, rather than expressive of 
physiological requirement, as the U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture points out. The standard 
for an individual depends upon many conditions. 
A man doing muscular work in the open air re- 
quires more food than a man leading a sedentary 
life. A man in the prime of life needs more food 
than either an older man or a boy. In general, a 
man needs more food than a woman because of his 
larger body and more vigorous life. Individuality 
plays an important part in choosing food for a 
particular person. A person may like this or 
that and refuse to touch what henioes not like. 
This is largely the result of training. A child 
should be taught to eat a variety of foods, includ- 
ing fruits and vegetables. Climate and season 

72 



FUEL VALUE AND DIETARY STANDARDS 73 

affect the appetite. In cold weather more heat- 
producing foods are needed, provided a person 
spends much time out of doors. 

Scientists have estimated that, as a general rule 
a man at active work needs about 3000 calories of 
food per day; that a woman needs about 2400 
calories per day; that a boy from ten to six- 
teen years of age needs 2400 to 2700 calories 
of food per day. If very active, as he is when 
playing football or other active games, or at 
work, the boy needs a diet with much higher 
energy value — 3000 or 4500 calories, even. A 
girl from ten to sixteen years of age needs from 
1800 to 2400 calories per day. A younger child 
needs from 900 to 1 500 calories per day. The pro- 
tein is less definitely determined than the energy, 
but 80 to 100 grams for 3000 calories of energy is a 
generally accepted figure. The dietary standard, 
to be consistent, should include figures for mineral 
matter, but these are difficult to give. It is gen* 
erally assumed, therefore, that a mixed diet 
including milk and vegetables and supplying 3000 
calories per day will provide the needed mineral 
matter. 

These figiures express amounts of food, which 
seem rather difficult to understand, but when, in 
addition, the proportion of nutrients is considered, 
the problem is difficult. It is not possible for the

average housewife to attempt to make accurate 
dietetic calculations. In fact, after the calcula- 
tions were made it would be necessary to see that 
each individual at the table had his particular 
portion if he were to have a so-called "balanced 
ration." 

The problem has been simplified by Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy, and the preceding table with the 
suggestions for its use are based upon his work. 

"The division must be more or less arbitrary, 
for some foods could go almost equally well in two 
or more groups. Thus milk, which is a general 
food, is included with the protein foods because 
it is a valuable source of this nutrient." Potatoes 
contain a large percentage of starch but their 
value for minerals has been used to determine their 
grouping. 

To obtain a fair estimate of the amount of food 
required by an individual, the approximate loo 
calorie portions may be used. Suppose John is an 
adult at active work. He needs about 3000 
calories of food. His meals may consist of the 
following menus, and this single illustration which 
can not be said to represent an unusually generous 
diet and which yet furnishes 3000 calories of 
energy, shows that people probably err in eating 
too much rather than in eating too little.

pounds, and engaged in moderately active, phys- 
ical work requires about loo grams of protein per 
day. Dr. Langworthy states that a mixed diet 
which includes 'the five food groups (see table p. 
74) and which supplies from 3000 to 3500 calories 
of energy per day almost inevitably supplies the 
needed protein, ash, and other constituents also. 
The diet is more likely to meet this requirement 
when milk is included in it. "To be more exact 
a dietary standard should also include figures 
expressing mineral requirements and require- 
ments for vitamines (regulating substances) of 
which minute amounts at least are essential. 
With present knowledge it is difl&cult to give such 
data. It is believed, however, that a general mixed 
diet will provide what is needed of both these."

LESSON XI— SECTION A 

BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 

In making out a bill-of-fare, a consideration of 
the various nutrients is important. Dr. C. F. 
Langworthy has simpUfied this part of the problem 
so that guided by the table on page 74, it is 
possible to plan meals furnishing the nutrients in 
fairly accurate proportions. In using the lists 
from the table to form menus, it is necessary that 
each group be represented, if not at every meal, at 
least once a day. "The use of an excessive nima- 
ber of food materials from any one group would 
result not only in making less appetizing meals but 
an undesirable proportion of food principles." 

The natural appetite tends to protect people 
from eating too much of one kind of food. With 
a few exceptions like bread and butter, the same 
kind of food should not be served twice at the 
same meal. Bean soup followed by a main course • 
including baked beans would pall the sense of 
taste. Avoid monotony. It may be convenient 
for the housewife always to serve corned beef on 
Monday, hash on Tuesday, and so on, but it 

is very undesirable as far as attractiveness is 

80 



BILL-OF-FARE MAKING 8 1 

concerned. A schedule for 14 days can be much 
more safely used than one for 7 days. A knowl- 
edge of what is to be served often causes the mind 
to rebel against the food and this results in a loss 
of appetite. • On the other hand, a surprise due 
to an unexpected dish stimulates the appetite. 

The market order must be carfefully made out 
so that the supplies shall be at hand when the 
preparation for a meal begins. A thrifty house- 
keeper plans her meals so well that there are few 
remnants except those she definitely desires for one 
of the many palatable "left-over" dishes. It is 
cheaper to buy food in large quantities but this is 
possible only when there is a suitable place for 
storage. 

The cost of food must be considered in planning 
meals. It is necessary to remember that the 
cheapest food is not always the most economical. 
If we buy a cheap cut of meat it is usually tough, 
and by the time it is cooked and the cost of the 
gas added to the first cost it may prove more 
expensive than a more tender piece. However, 
if there is a fire in the coal range, an3rway, or if a 
fireless cooker is used, there is economy in the 
cheaper cut. Vegetables and fruits used out of 
season are no more nourishing than when they 
are more abundant and cheaper and they are 
an extravagance for the average family. 



82 HOME DIETETICS 

Unnecessary waste should be avoided. Some 
vegetables and fruits have to be pared, cored, etc., 
but the waste may be reduced to the minimum. 
Potatoes may be carefully scrubbed and then 
boiled, and the outside skin removed before they 
are served. The flavor is not only better but the 
valuable mineral matter is retained. Ask the 
butcher to send home the trimmings of meat. 
The bones and lean meat may be used for soup 
stock. The fat can be tried out and used for 
shortening. Chicken fat thus prepared is excel- 
lent for cake. 

Labor spent in the preparation of food should 
be considered. Is not the housewife's energy of 
some value? A mother might far better prepare 
simpler meals, even though they are somewhat 
more expensive, than to work so hard that she 
comes to the table too tired to enjoy the meal with 
her family.

LESSON Xn— SECTION A 

SERVING FAMILY MEALS 

In most homes some of the members of the 
household are engaged in occupations which re- 
quire them to be away during the greater part 
of the day. As a result of this the meal time, 
especially at night, is the only opportunity for 
real enjosmaent in the family drcle. Careful 
thought should therefore be given to planning 
and furnishing the- dining-room. 

It should be a room large enough to meet the 
needs of the family, with an allowance for the 
occasional guest. There should be plenty of 
windows to admit light, air, and sunshine. A 
pleasant outlook is also desirable. 

The woodwork may be painted white or stained 
and varnished to harmonize with the furniture. 
The walls should be covered with a simple, plain 
paper which harmonizes with the rug and the 
furniture. The ceiling should be lightest in 
tone, the walls medium, and the rug darkest. 
A dark, cold room needs a warm toned paper, 
say one of yellow-brown, while a gray green or 
blue may be used on a warm, sunny room. A 

86 



SERVING FAMILY MEALS 87 

few pictures may be used, but a plate rail or any 
other "dust catcher" is undesirable. 

Direct artificial light which produces a glare 
is unpleasant in its effects. Either side lights or 
the modern indirect lighting is much better. The 
window curtains should be of a soft, simple 
material, such as musUn or scrim. The curtains 
are pleasing and they are also more sanitary if 
they are fastened to a small rod and then allowed 
to hang in straight folds which just clear the 
window sill. If more light is needed or if there 
is a beautiful outlook, slide the curtains from the 
center and fiU the gap at the top with a piece of 
the curtain which is nine to twelve inches in length. 

Have only such furniture in the room as is 
really necessary. A table, chairs, and a sideboard 
or serving table are sufficient. It should be simple 
but substantial. Furniture which is made along 
plain lines and without ornamentation is in good 
taste. Choose chairs which have the lines of the 
back following the curve of the human body, as 
they will be much more comfortable. 

The linen shoidd be simple in design and should 
be of good quality. There is no economy in 
buying cheap Knen. The china, glass, and silver 
are also in better taste if they are either perfectly 
plain or are decorated near the edge with a simple, 
conventional design. Avoid gilt on cheap dishes. 



OO ■ HOME DIETETICS 

A table cloth may be used with propriety at 
any meal, but doiUes are permissible for break- 
fast and luncheon. When a cloth is used, a 
silence cloth of asbestos or canton flannel should 
be placed on the table first. This not only dulls

sounds but serves to protect the table. The 
table doth should be placed on the table with the 
long fold lengthwise. A small, low growing plant ~ 
or a few cut flowers give a touch of beauty to the 
table. A simple white doily may be used under 
the dish holding the plant.. 



SERVING FAMILY MEALS 89 

Only the silver, glass, and china needed should 
be placed upon the table. They should be ar- 
ranged as indicated on the diagram. The silver 
is placed in order of use from the outside toward 
the plate; that is, a soup spoon should be placed 
still farther to the right if soup is to be the first 
course. 

With a simple home service it is important that 
all the food, dishes, etc., needed for a particular 
course, be on the table. Hot food should be 
served on hot dishes and cold food should be served 
on cold dishes. A wheel tray is convenient for 
such a service, and every woman doing her own 
work should not only own one, but should learn 
to use it. A very satisfactory wagon can be made 
by fastening a wooden tray upon the wheels of an 
old baby carriage.

LESSON XIII— SECTION A 

FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG 

CHILDREN^ 

Each year greater attention is given to the care 
and feeding of infants, so that they may be 
properly nourished and developed into healthy 
citizens, prepared to meet the responsibilities of 
life. To bring about these results the care must 
start with the birth of the child and continue 
throughout the years of growth and development. 

Nature's food, mother's milk, is most desirable 
for infants because it contains all the necessary 
nutrients in the right proportions to properly 
nourish the child. No perfect substitute for 
mother's milk has been obtained. It is necessary, 
however, to resort to artificial feeding when no 
milk is secreted, when the mother is delicate, or 
when the child does not thrive on mother's milk. 
Cow's milk is the usual substitute for mother's 
milk, but to be fed successfully to an infant it 
needs modifying to make it more nearly like 
mother's milk. Water may be added to it to 
reduce the protein and other nutrients; cream, to 

^ A practical demonstration of the care of bottles, nipples, etc., 
should be given with this lesson. 

92 



FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN 93 

increase the fat; milk-sugar, to increase the car- 
bohydrates; and sometimes lime water, to make 
the milk alkaline. If it becomes necessary to 
resort to artificial feeding, it is best to consult 
the family physician, who will either give a formula 
for modifying, or give directions how to obtain 
modified milk. 

In order that the infant may be healthy and 
thrive, whether breast-fed or bottle-fed, it is 
necessary not only to have the right food, but also 
to feed it regularly, to be sure that everything is 
kept in perfectly sanitary condition, to keep the 
child quiet after it is fed, and to allow it to sleep 
two or three hours after each feeding. 

After the first six or eight months, the physician 
may begin to prescribe simple gruels, etc., until 
the child can take whole milk. When the child is 
about fourteen months old, thicker cereals are some- 
times ordered. They should be thoroughly cooked 
for about three hours, and then strained. They 
may be fed from a spoon. 

By the end of the first year the normal child 
should be taking eight or nine oimces of food at 
a time, five times a day. During the second year 
the lime water and milk sugar may be gradually 
omitted and broth (mutton, veal, or chicken) and 
egg-white added. Orange juice and beef juice 
may also be given. 



94 HOME DIETETICS 

During the third year the child is given a 
greater quantity ol solids. Potatoes and other 
vegetables are introduced into the diet. 

Detailed directions for feeding infants may be 
obtained from some recognized authoritative 
book, such as Holt's "The Care and Feeding of 
Chndren." 

When a child is old enough to be given solid 
foods, it is very essential to his health that he be 
allowed plenty of time for his meals and that he 
learn to masticate his food thoroughly. Food 
should be given at regular intervals, but nothing 
between meals. The largest meal should be given 
at the middle of the day, and a light supper at 
least a half-hour before bed-time. Milk may be 
given once between meals. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, 
eggs, beefsteak, mutton chops, roast lamb, and 
chicken; baked, boiled, or steamed vegetables; 
sponge cakes and lady-fingers (if not fresh) ; fruits, 
custards, junkets, rice pudding, tapioca, or gela- 
tine; milk, water, and cocoa. 

The following foods should not be given to 
children: Dried or salted meat or fish; raw vege- 
tables; fried foods; fresh or hot breads; rich cakes, 
pastry, and rich preserves ; tea, coffee, or alcoholic 
drinks. 

It is not wise to wait until a child grows up before 



FOOD FOR INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN gS 

teaching him good table manners. Children 
should not sit sidewise or on the edge of the chair. 
They should not put their elbows on the table. 
Warn them not to drink imtil they have swallowed 
the food that they may be eating. D o no t let them 
lean their glasses over their nose while they are 
drinking. Teach them to eat solid food with a 
fork, taking only small portions at one time. 
Soup should be eaten quietly from the side of the 
spoon and it should be dipped away from rather 
than toward the person who is eating. Do not 
allow a child to tip dishes in order to get the last 
bit of food. When taking food from a dish in 
which it is served, the utensils supplied for that 
purpose should be used and not the child's knife, 
fork, or spoon. Children should not be allowed 
to reach across the table for food nor to reach in 
front of another person. When not in use, the 
knife and fork should be laid along the side of the 
plate and the spoon should be on the side of the 
saucer. Children should be cautioned against 
speaking when their mouths are full, keeping their 
mouths open when they are eating, or smacking 
their lips. They should not be allowed to monop- 
olize the conversation at the table but reasonable 
questions" should be answered and they should 
be encouraged to contribute to the general conver- 
sation. There should be no such thing as "com-

pany manners." Careless or greedy habits should 
be checked as they appear. The problem is an 
easy one if parents are careful to observe the rules 
of good manners themselves, for children will 
become polite by imitation.

LESSON XIV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR SCHOOL 

The diet of a child is always important, as it 
determines to a large extent the physical condition 
in later life. All though school life, a constant 
supervision of the food of a child is necessary. 
Digestion and assimilation are very active; all 
parts of the body are increasing in size; the muscles 
are trained to more coordinated activity; and 
the nervous system is constantly receiving and 
storing new impressions. The body requires suffi- 
cient food of the right kind to nourish it and to 
stimulate its activities. Investigations prove 
that many so-called backward children are dull 
because of the lack of proper nourishment. 

To keep up these body functions, to repair 
wastes of the body, and to aid in the development 
of new tissues, it is necessary to furnish liberal 
and well planned meals so arranged that they 
supply the needed mineral matters and growth- 
stimulating substances as well as protein and 
energy. Care must be taken to furnish variety 
in the food, for children in this period of unrest 
tire of a monotonous diet. Some foods may be 
chosen for flavor alone. 

lOO 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL lOI 

Frequently children are interested in their play 
or Other activities at meal time and their bodies 
are not in proper condition to take care of the 
food eaten. Sufficient time should be required 
to prepare for meals. A child should be required 
to wash his hands and face and comb his hair 
before coming to the table. He should keep his 
mouth clean and his teeth in good condition. 
After meals children should not play or work hard 
until sufficient time has been taken for the diges- 
tion of the food. To hurry to school with no 
breakfast or an insufficient amount and kind, 
causes hunger and fatigue during the mommg and 
poor work in lessons. Children should be re- 
quired to take a full breakfast, consisting of fruit, 
fresh or stewed; well cooked cereal, served with 
milk or cream and a little sugar; some toast or 
day-old bread; and a drink of hot milk or cocoa. 
If the child will eat more, soft-cooked eggs may 
be added. 

DIET FOR ADOLESCENT CHILDREN 

There is no time in the whole life history of the 
individual during which there is more urgent need 
of the materials required to build up the red blood 
cells than between the ages of twelve and sixteen. 
During this period the foundation of physical 
efficiency is laid, and the normal healthy boy or 



I02 HOME DIETETICS 

girl will usually require almost as much food as 
an adult. 

At this age children develop abnormal appetites 
or notions about their food, and usually more 
attention must be given to flavors, attractiveness, 
and variety. As iron is a necessity for the de- 
velopment of the red blood cjbUs, some of the foods 
containing high percentages of iron, such as beef, 
eggs, raisins, prunes, beans, peas, lentils, or green 
vegetables, especially spinach, asparagus, cabbage, 
lettuce, and celery, should be used in the diet 
daily. 

To further the physical development of the 
child, besides supplying an abundance of non- 
stimulating food, it is necessary to watch care- 
fully the hygienic condition. The child should 
be trained in regular habits of Ufe, should have 
plenty of out-of-door exercise and an abundance 
of sleep — from nine to ten hours daily. 

The Lunch Box. — ^When the child begins school 
his daily life is radically changed, and the food 
requirements of the body are greatly increased to 
meet the many new demands on the body. There 
is great need of a lunch in the middle of the session. 
In many schools a recess is given and lunches may 
be eaten. In some schools lunches are furnished 
by the school for a small sum. Children should 
be encouraged to bring lunches from home or 



FOOD FOR SCHOOL IO3 

shoxild be supplied with money to buy a lunch at 
school. 

Often the school is situated a long distance from 
home and the child is not able to go home for the 
mid-day meal. Such conditions require the child 
to carry enough lunch for the whole day, and the 
lunch box needs special attention. 

The box itself is of utmost importance, for the 
food must remain in it several hours. A metal 
box is most desirable as it can be easily sterilized. 
The collapsible type is most convenient to carry 
home when emptied. 

To have a lunch palatable after it has been 
packed several hours requires great care. Each 
article of food should be wrapped separately in 
paraffine paper, which keeps the food from drying 
out. The small packages should then be packed 
closely but neatly. The appearance of the lunch 
box should be made as dainty and attractive as 
possible. Napkins, either paper or linen, should 
be included.* 

Sandwiches usually form the main part of the 
lunch and can be prepared in attractive shapes 
from many different materials. The bread may 
be white, whole wheat, graham, oatmeal, or nut, 
and should be cut thin, about one-fourth inch thick. 
Choice may be made from a variety of fillings such 
as meats, fish, and eggs with or without a salad 
dressing; cheese, jellies, and peanut butter. 

8 



I04 HOME DIETETICS 

Something sweet should be included such as 
cakes, cookies, candies, dates, figs or raisins, and 
some relish such as olives, pickles, radishes, celery, 
or fresh fruit. If this can be supplemented with 
a cup of cocoa or a bowl of soup the child need 
jiot suffer as a result of carrying lunches to school. 

The lunch time at school should be as pleasant 
a meal time as any other, and good habits in 
eating as well as good manners should be developed.

LESSON XV— SECTION A 
FOOD FOR THE SICK 

An invalid is a person disabled by infirmities 
or disease. As each case has a special cause or 
causes, each must be considered separately and 
a special diet planned. In each case the person 
will benefit greatly by proper dietetic and hygienic 
treatment. 

In hospitals and among nurses and physicians 
diets for invalids are usually classified as liquid, 
soft-solid, and special. Liquid diets include milk, 
broths, beef juice, beef tea, cocoa, fruit beverages, 
barley and rice waters, gruel, and cream soups. 
In soft diets are found soft-cooked eggs, milk 
toast, custards, jellies, junkets, ice creams, and 
ices. The solid diet includes simple foods con- 
taining solid parts, sucK as cereals, vegetables, 
meats, fruits, desserts (except pastry and rich 
cakes), and eggs in all forms except hard-boiled. 
Special diets are usually planned with particular 
reference to the peculiar condition of the patient 
and are especially prescribed by the physician. 

In preparing dietaries for invalids only a few 

general directions can be given, as each person 

needs certain foods, depending upon the disease, 

Z07 



Io8 HOME DIETETICS 

the constitution, surroundings, etc. The doctor 
should prescribe the diet the patient may have, 
and the nurse must follow his directions to the 
letter, giving the food in the proper quantities 
and at regular intervals. It is unwise to consult 
a patient about his food if he is on a diet. If a 
patient asks for some special food, always consult 
the doctor about it before giving it to the patient. 

Before serving an invalid bathe face and hands, 
adjust pillows, and fix him in as comfortable a 
position as possible. If a regular invalid table is 
not available, a pile of books or magazines on each 
side of the patient's knees will serve as supports 
for the tray, or a table may easily be prepared 
from a wooden soap box by removing the sides 
and top. The ends will form the table legs and 
the bottom the table top. 

Great care must be exercised in preparing the 
tray. It should be of a convenient size to ac- 
commodate the menu, and should be covered with 
a clean white cloth. 

The dishes should be the most attractive avail- 
able and should be arranged in an artistic but a 
simple form. A flower adds to the appearance of 
the tray and may please the invalid. Or, a little 
surprise in the nature of a gift or a letter or a note 
from a friend may distract his attention so that while 
enjoying these he unconsciously enjoys his meal 



FOOD FOR THE SICK I09 

or takes the nourishment without pa3dng much 
attention to it. • 

In serving a patient, it is wise not to serve too 
many things at one time and always to serve in 
small quantities, for the patient will try to eat 
all of a small serving, while a generous serving 
may take away what little appetite he has. 
Be sure of the seasonings and temperature of the 
food and always serve hot foods hot and cold 
foods cold. When the diet is limited vary it as 
much as possible in preparation and serving. 

After the meal, the tray and all traces of the 
meal should be removed. 

If the patient's appetite is poor it may some- 
times be stimulated by giving fruit beverages, 
beef tea, and oysters. These in themselves have 
but little food value but tend to increase the 
flow of the digestive juices, and these in turn create 
a desire for food. 

All cereals should be thoroughly cooked and 
toast should be crisp all through, not just browned 
on the outside. It may be softened with hot milk 
or water. 

Milk and eggs form the main articles in an in- 
valid's diet, and can be served in a variety of ways. 
Gelatines and ices furnish an attractive means of 
serving liquid foods in solid forms, and cream 
soups add variety to milk diet. 



no HOME DIETETICS 

Constipation, which is very common and which 
is frequently the source of many diseases, results 
from such causes as carelessness in attention to 
bodily functions at the proper time, lack of exer- 
cise, too little water, lack of bulk in food, lack of 
the natural laxative salts and acids of vegetables 
and fruits, improper habits in eating, or the use 
of indigestible foods. When constipation seems 
due to other than such causes a physician should 
always be consulted. 

Foods which in themselves are laxative are 
commonly of much benefit. The following are 
generally believed to aid greatly in relieving the 
trouble: oranges, lemons, grapefruit, apples, 
prunes, figs, asparagus and other green vegetables, 
molasses, honey, olive oil, butter, cream, oatmeal, 
whole-grain breads, bran biscuit, and buttermilk. 

Another common disease which needs dietetic 
and hygienic rather than medical treatment, is 
anemia. This disease results in an insufficient 
supply of red blood cells. It is often caused by 
improper diet, especially one lacking in foods 
containing iron; intestinal or other parasites; 
improper ventilation and clothing; lack of outdoor 
exercise; and an insufficient amount of sleep. 
In such cases a cure may be brought about by the 
use of plenty of well-cooked cereals, milk, eggs, 
simple foods, plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, 



FOOD FOR THE SICK III 

and regular meals. It is better to take five light 
meals a day than three heavy meals. More seri- 
ous anemia is also known, so a physician's advice 
should be sought when anemia occurs.
