SAUTED OYSTERS 

Drain twenty-five fat oysters,

with salt and red pepper. Have 
ready a large sheet-iron saute 
pan. Put in the bottom just 
sufficient butter to keep the 
oysters from sticking. Have at 
your side the serving dish, nicely 
heated, in which you may put a 
tablespoonful of butter, and if 
you use wine, a tablespoonful of 

38 



New Ways for Oysters 

sherry, and about four drops of 
Worcestershire sauce. Now 
throw the oysters, a few at a 
time, into the hot pan ; shake

gills have curled ; put them into 
the serving dish and then cook 
a second lot. Do not cook over 
eight at a time. Serve at once.

butter and then strain or pour it 
off carefully, leaving the sedi- 
ment in the melting pan. Put 
the strained butter in a heated

New Ways for Oysters 

serve the oysters. Have ready 
a good-sized kettle of boiling 
water, and the oysters drained, 
in a bowl, which hold close to 
the kettle in your left hand. 
Now with a skimmer take out 
five or six oysters. Throw them 
into the boiling water for just a 
minute. Then with the same 
skimmer take them out, drain 
carefully, throw them into the 
heated dish of melted butter, and 
so continue until you have the 
desired quantity boiled. Add 
then to each twenty-five a half 
teaspoonful of salt and just a 
grain of cayenne. Serve them 
smoking hot. This is one 
of the nicest ways of cooking 
40

oysters, boil the liquor, skim and 
strain it. Into a saucepan 
put one tablespoonful of but- 
ter and one good-sized onion, 
sliced ; stir and cook until the 
onion is a golden brown ; then 
add a level tablespoonful of flour, 
mix and add the oyster liquor, 
which should measure one-half 
pint. If it does not, add sufli- 
cient chicken stock to make the 
quantity ; stir until boiling ; add 

41 



New Ways for Oysters 

a teaspoonful of curry powder 
and a teaspoonful of turmeric, 
moistened with a little stock, 
and boil again ; add one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, and 
strain into the upper part of a 
double boiler. Have ready a 
griddle, quite hot. Brush it 
lightly with butter, throw on 
four or five of the oysters ; as 
soon as they sear or brown, turn 
them, brown, and throw them 
into the curry sauce. So con- 
tinue until you have the whole 
number cooked. Serve at once. 



42 



New Ways for Oysters 
PAN BAKED 

Drain twenty-five oysters free 
from all liquor. The oysters 
should be good-sized and fat. 
In the bottom of an individual 
baking dish put one square of 
nicely toasted bread. On top of 
this arrange about six oysters ; 
sprinkle over them a quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt and a dash of 
pepper, and then pour over four 
tablespoonfuls of cream. Stand 
these dishes in a baking pan, 
then run in a hot oven and bake 
for ten minutes. Serve at once 
in the dishes in which they were 
cooked. 



43

OYSTER TARTS 

Have ready about half pound 
of French puff paste. Drain 
fifty oysters. Put them in ten 
individual baking dishes. Dust

a grain of red pepper, and place

ter the size of a hickory nut. Roll 
the paste in a thin sheet ; with 
a round cutter stamp out a top. 
Place this top over the oysters, 
brush it lightly with yolk of an 
egg, bake in quick oven twenty 
minutes. Serve in the dishes in 
which they were baked. These,

Select large fat oysters ; lay 
them out singly on a board, dry

of sherry, if you use it. Let it 
stand on the back part of the 
stove while you broil the oys- 
ters. Put over the hottest part 
of the fire the ordinary cake 
griddle. Have the oysters at 
hand, and when the griddle is 
smoking hot brush it lightly with 
a little butter ; throw on four or 
five oysters, brown quickly ; 
turn, and as soon as they are 
brown on this side, lift them into 
the brown sauce, and so con- 
tinue until all the oysters are 
"broiled." To have these a per- 
fect success, your gridiron must 
be very, very hot, and only a 
few oysters at a time browned. 
The moment an oyster touches

juice, and the juice will prevent

of doing only four or five at a 
time. Dish on toast, and pour
