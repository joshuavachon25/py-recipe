COPIED AND EDITED FROM THE SLOANE MS. 1986

AUTHOR OF "the ETYMOLOGY OF LOCAL NAMES ' 
MEMBER OF THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY.

:<PC 






The following curious poem on Cookery is now first 
printed from a transcript of the Sloane MS. 1986, where 
it occurs as an appendix to the "-Boke of Curtasye'"'. It 
is written in a Northern dialect of the XV' century, pro- 
bably not much earlier than the time of Henry VI. The 
author of the poem furnishes us with an appropriate English 
title in the opening of the work, where he speaks of his 
subject as "The Slyjtes of Cure"', or, as expressed in more 
modern English, "The Art of Cookery"'. 

Though the poem professes to be somewhat comprehensive, 
and treats of a gi-eat variety of dishes under the titles of Potages, 
broths, roasted meats, baked meats, sauces and 'petecure', it 
is still far from containing an account of all the ancient dishes, 
upon the preparation of which the cooks of old prided them- 
selves so much, as may be seen upon comparing this poem with 
the tracts upon Old English Cookery contained in Warners 
'Antiquitates Culinariae' and in the 'Collection of Ordinances 
and Regulations for the government of the Royal House- 
hold'.^ 

Some knowledge of the composition of these dishes is 
rendered necessary by the constant allusions to them in 
our early English Metrical Romances , which give the poem 
an Archaeological as well as a Philological value. 

* Edited by Mr. Halliwell for the Percy Society. 
2 Referred to at p, 20 n. as " Ord. and Reg." 



IV PREFACE. 

From internal evidence it would seem that the author of 
this poem was a native of North -West Lancashire, for we 
find the same peculiarities which have been pointed out 
by Mr. Robson in the Romances edited by him for the 
Camden Society, viz. the plurals of Nouns in -us and pas- 
sive participles in -ud^ or -ut, to which may be added the 
forms schyn, schun (= shall) and loyn, loynn, (will) which I 
have not met with elsewhere. 

The usual Northumbrian grammatical forms occur, as tas 
for takes; tone and totlier for that one and that other; -s as 
the ending of all the persons (Singular and Plural) in the 
Present Tense Indie. Mood, and as the sign of the 2°'^ Person, 
Imperative Mood ; and -and as the termination of the Present 
Participle. 

For all words enclosed in brackets I alone am responsible. 
No alteration has been made in the text of the MS. without 
some acknowledgment in a foot-note,
