PEEFACE 



Having devoted a large portion of my life to the study 
and practice of the various branches of the art of 
Cookery — which period includes several years of practical 
experience in some of the first culinary establishments, 
both in England and on the Continent — I am led by 
the experience thus gained, to the conclusion that many 
things, both new and useful, remain to be added to the 
numerous manuals of the Culinary Art already in 
existence. 

I therefore venture to offer the following pages to 
the public, in the hope that they may prove interesting 
and valuable to all, especially to those who are engaged 
in the business of catering. 

Of the numerous books on Cookery which have been 
recently given to the public — many excellent in their 
way — the majority lack one very essential point, viz. : 
an explanation of the langue cle cuisine, including the 
numerous French phrases and technical terms now in 
constant use, but which are seldom properly understood. 

It is chiefly to enable those engaged in the practice 
or superintendence of high-class Cookery to compose a 
menu, and to give each dish its correct name — whether 
in Enghsh or French — that this book has been written. 

I have always held the opinion, that in cases where 

B 



4 PRACTICAL GASTEONOMY 

it is thought necessary to give French names to the 
dishes, this should be done as concisely as possible, by 
the use of that peculiar French which is tlie language 
of cookery. I have therefore given the names of the 
various _pZft^s in the "Menu Compiler and Register oi 
Dishes," to which I have appended comprehensive 
descriptions. 

The headings to each list of the various kinds oi 
comestibles have been given in French and English. 
This has been done in order to assist the inexperienced 
to compile a bill of fare correctly, and to enable them tc 
supersede the French names (often ridiculously spelt), 
by intelhgible English ones. 

The Vocabulary of Terms used in Cookery contains 
nearly a thousand words and phrases used in the art. 
These are translated and explained ; and details of the 
origin and history of the more interesting are also given 

With a view to rendering this work as complete at 
possible, a series of two hundred Specimen Menus haj 
been inserted — in English, French, and other languages 
These mclude examples of fixed-price luncheons, dinners 
&c., such as are served in London clubs, hotels, anc 
restaurants. A few Classical Menus will interesi 
students of history. A list of quotations from the workf 
of standard authors is also given, which will, it is hoped 
Idc found useful in the compilation of menus for specia 
occasions. 

The object of this book is to present to the readei 
an Oracle of Gastronomy ; a culinary guide for every- 
day reference ; a vocabulary of English and foreigr 
terms used in cookery ; as well as a collection o: 
epigrams and quotations bearing on the art ; and a fe"w 
historical sketches relating to it. I therefore trust thai 
it will prove a help to advocates of the School of Frencl 



PREFACE D 

Cookery, a gastronomic treat to the gourmet^ a valuable 
book of reference for hotel proprietors, managers, and 
chefs, as well as for ladies who manage their own esta- 
blishments ; and that it may be found useful and accept-

I have spared no pains to render this work as com- 
plete and accurate, and *' up to date," as possible ; but, 
as new dishes and new ideas in regard to culinary 
preparations are coming to light almost daily, I cannot 
claim for my book that it is a complete and exhaustive 
treatise, although I have endeavoured as far as possible 
to make it one.

ADVERTISEMENT TO THE SECOND EDITION. 



In issuing the Second Edition of this book I desire to 
express my best thanks for the manner in which it has 
been received by the Catering Fraternity, as well as 
others interested in the Art of Cookery. 

With the view of increasing its general utility the 
work has undergone careful revision. 

I wish also to assure my readers that I will not 
relax my endeavours to improve the work, by including 
any novelties and improvements in the Art which may 
come under my notice.

PEEFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION. 



I BEG to return my thanks for the patronage accorded 
to former editions of my book, '' Practical Gastronomy 
and Culinary Dictionary." The success with which 
this work has been received, both by the profession and 
the general pubhc, has encouraged me to hope for a 
continuance of their generous approbation and support. 

At the suggestion of some of the leading members 
of the profession, and several ladies and gentlemen 
interested in cookery and gastronomy, I have increased 
the work by adding eight hundred recipes of useful and 
up-to-date cookery, most of which have been practically 
worked out and tested. This addition has been made 
with the hope of increasing the usefulness of the book 
to cooks, managers, and others to whom the manage- 
ment of the kitchen is entrusted. 

A great part of the work has been rewritten, and 
the whole of it carefully revised and brought up to the 
present requirements of the art. The vocabulary of 
technical terms used in cookery has been enlarged, and 
bills of fare (menus) for every month in the year have 
been added. No trouble or expense has been spared to 
bring the work up to date, and make it a reliable text 
book of the culinary art, useful to the cook, helpful to 
those desirous of a more exact knowledge of the art. and 
acceptable to the public generally. 

I take this opportunity of thanking all those who 
have shown their kind appreciation of my efforts, and 
the friendly notices of the press.

THE AET OF COOKEEY 



Ancient and Modern. 



Although the traditions of classic cookery are almost 
effaced, there still remains sufficient record to afford 
some grounds for comparison, and he must be prejudiced 
who hesitates for a moment in awarding the laurels to 
the moderns. 

Cookery is eminently experimental, and our knowledge 
is increased through our daily experience and practice in 
the art. 

Jean Clerc, speaking once of a celebrated cookery 
book, observes that the work contains receipts for " some 
most extraordinary dishes and strange stews and ragouts, 
which would ruin one's stomach and burn up the blood." 
The Komans in their days excelled in tne culinary art, 
and we have been enabled to inherit from them and 
profit by the benefit of their experience, which means 
that we have surpassed them in the knowledge of 

1 



12 PEACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

classical cookery without their extravagances. The 
characteristic of ancient cookery was profusion; the 
characteristic of modern cookery is delicacy and 
refinement. 

The only ancient sauce which seems to remain on 
record is, so far as we know, the one known to the 
Romans under the name of " Garum" ; it is made from 
the brine of anchovy-fish. This sauce is still used in 
Turkey as a sort of flavouring for their national dish 
called "Pilau." All traces of Roman cookery as an art 
seem to have been lost about the fifth century ; but the 
monks soon revived the ancient art. They made 
cookery a study, wrote their experiences, and their 
records have been handed down to us. 

The name of Coelius Apician, well connected with 
Roman cookery, is associated with the most ancient 
European work on cookery. 

Warner in his " Antiquitates Culinariae," 1791, gives 
some specimens of Roman cookery recipes : two of these 
show how the Roman cook of the Apician epoch used to 
dress a hog's paunch, and how to manufacture "sauce 
for a boiled chicken." Another name known as that of 
a famous Roman epicure is "Trojan," who, it is said, was 
the true godfather of the culinary manual. M. W. 
Carew Hazlitt, in his work on " Old Cookery Books and 
Ancient Cuisine," gives that full credit to the ancient 
Roman Cathohc clergy, which has not always been 
accorded to them, of being largely instrumental in 
modifying the early barbarism of the table and of 
encouraging the study of gastronomy. Their secluded 



THE ART OP COOKERY 13 

life, he thinks, led them " to seek some compensation 
for the loss of the other wordly pleasures in those of the 
table." 

In the early days the choice of animal food was 
somewhat coarse as well as exclusive, as at that time the 
whale was in considerable requisition for gastronomic 
purposes. It was found on the royal table as well as 
on that of the Lord Mayor of London, who had then 
evidently, as now, a weakness for culinary delicacies. 
The "piece de resistance," I read, at a banquet which 
Wolsey gave some of his official acquaintances in 1509 
was a young porpoise, and it was customary for such to 
be taken to the banqueting hall whole, and carved by the 
officer in attendance. 

In the fifteenth century the list of dishes in vogue 
was augmented, and amongst others in regular use were 
fish soup, wine soup, and ale soup. 

The cannibals of the ancient world (Anthropophagi) 
greedily devoured the carcasses of their fellow creatures ; 
while the inoffensive " Cabri " (a Scythian tribe) found 
both food and drink in the agreeable nut of the Pontic 
tree; the "Lotophagi" lived entirely on the fruit of 
the lotus tree ; the savage " Troglodyte " esteemed a 
living serpent the most delicate of all morsels while the 
capricious palate of the " Ziguntini " preferred the ape 
to everything. 

The Eomans usually began their feasts with eggs, 
and ended them with fruits ; hence Ab ovo usque ad 
mala. During the luxurious period of their empire, 



14 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

they took five meals a day ; which consisted of the 
following : a breakfast (ye?itocwZ^im) ; a dinner (^:)raw{?mm), 
which was a light meal without any formal preparation ; 
between dinner and supper they had a kind of tea as we 
would call it [merenda) ; a supper {cospa or coRua) ; 
this formed their great meal, and generally consisted of 
two courses, the first of meats, the second of a sort 
of dessert ; another meal was served after supper : 
this was called comissatio, something delicious or 
revelling. 

The dishes which the Eomans held in the highest 
estimation were : pheasants* (_2j/iasza?iz^, "ex Phaside 
Colchido fluvio "), nightingales {hiscinics), thrushes 
(turdi), ducks, geese, sausages, and puddings. 

The meat of the Porpoise, a marine animal, was 
dressed in various ways, salted, roasted, and stewed. 
The flesh of it was hard and rancid, and, although now 
quite unknown, it is said that it was sold in the markets 
of most Portuguese towns in the last century. The 
swan was also a most favourite dish in the time of our 
ancestors. At a dinner given by the Earl of Northumber- 
land in the year 1512 it is said that the number, con- 
sumed amounted to twenty. 

Table-cloths were used at Norman feasts, and the 
long ends were used as napkins ; hence their condition 
would scarcely allow of a second use. Later on these 
were discarded. Forks were not known at that time, 
but bills of fare showed some variety and taste as well as 

* From phasiamis, a biid coming from the river Phasis, 
in Colchid, south of Caucasus. 



THE ABT OF COOKERY 15 

a great deal of costliness. Their cookery was such an 
improvement on that of their predecessors in the island 
that the French and Norman dishes drove the Saxon 
tongue and table into an almost vulgar position. The 
art was so much esteemed that monarchs even granted 
estates on condition that the holder thereof should, through 
his cook, prepare a certain dish at stated periods, and set 
it before the king. 

The Norman conqueror William bestowed several 
portions of land on these highly favoured domestics 
"the cooks." This shows us how sensible our fore- 
fathers were, as at that time the talent of knowing how 
to cook was so rare that it was considered a high dis- 
tinction, so much so that the king's first and second 
cooks were titled *' Esquires " by their office. 

Under the Normans the celebrated boar's head be- 
came a royal dish, and its progress from the kitchen 
to the banqueting hall was under the escort of a 
guard, and heralded by trumpeters. There is no doubt 
that our forefathers had firm faith in good cooking, 
that is, of course, as good as it could be at the time. It 
would, however, be unjust to draw any comparison be- 
tween the cooking of the days of yore and to-day. But 
it was the best they could get, and that perhaps 
might compare favourably with sojne of the cookery 
with which many of us moderns are familiar. The 
saying, "God sent meat, and the devil sent cooks," is 
a maxim which up to the present has not been success- 
fully disputed ; and if, at occasional exceptions, this 
may have been true, there is, owing to the intelligence 



16 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

of the present age, no longer any need for the old sneer 
of this dyspeptic cynic. 

The ancient Britons have more than once been com- 
pared with the New Zealanders. They were, perhaps, 
more unci\ilised and quite as ignorant, and their absti- 
nence from the flesh of hares and poultry and, in the 
northern parts of the island, from fish, bespeaks a race 
which lacked at once industry and knowledge. Indeed, 
it is by no means certain that we do not wrong the 
New Zealanders by suggesting their possible inferiority 
to the Britons, seeing that the latter are strongly 
suspected of being guilty of the most revolting canni- 
balism. 

They were clever enough to brew mead and ale, but 
T\dne and civilisation were brought to them by their 
enemies, the Roman invaders, who, for some reasons, 
they might have welcomed as " our friends the enemy." 
Their seats were skins or bundles of hay flung on the 
ground, their table was a low stool, around which 
British chiefs sat. 

They ate but twice a day, their last meal being the 
more important one. They used to tear their food with 
teeth and nails, or hacked at it with a wretched knife, 
as bad as anything of the sort now in common use 
in gaol. 

The Anglo-Saxons introduced four meals a day : 
they ate good solid joints of flesh meat, boiled, baked, 
or broiled. 

It would seem that in those days cooks were not of 
such an illustrious guild as that which they subse- 



THE ART OF COOKERY 17 

quently formed. A cook among the Anglo- Saxons was 
valued very little higher than the calf he cut up into 
scallops. He was a slave, and was as unceremoniously 
bequeathed in his owner's will as any goods or chattels. 
At the Anglo-Saxon feasts men and women sat together 
as they do now, which is a mark of civihsation, and 
pronounced to be very refining. Turkey is the only 
European nation that does not follow this capital 
example. 

When the Normans came to England, they brought 
with them greater comfort in regard to cooking as 
well as eating. 

Much of the exquisite cuisine of the eighteenth 
century is due to that famous epicure "Regent Or- 
leans." The " pain a la d'Orleans " was the invention 
of the Regent himself ; the " filets de lapereau k la 
Berri" were invented by his abandoned daughter, 
the Duchess de Berri, whose suppers were the best 
and most profligate m Paris. The " filets de volaille k 
la Bellevue " were invented by the Marquise de Pom- 
padour in the Chateau of Bellevue for the little sup- 
pers of the King. The "petites bouchees a la Reine " 
owe their origin to Marie, the wife of Louis XV., 
and nearly all the entrees bearing the name of 
Bayonnaises " were invented by the Marechal Due de 
Richelieu. 

The French Revolution made a mournful gap in the 
annals of cooking. The stoic's fare, the radish and the 
egg of the severe Spartan, and the black bread of 
the Germans of the Middle Ages were then in vogue, 



18 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

and for three years this Spartan regime continued. 
Happily for mankind and gourmands, the traditions 
of the French kitchen were preserved, even during 
this depressing period, and under Napoleon the art 
revived again. 

This was signalised by the publication of the first 
number of the " Almanach des Gourmands," which 
the late Duke of York called the most delightful 
book ever printed. The author and editor of it was 
*' Grimod de la Reyniere," a quaint humourist as well 
as an able chef. 

This is what he says, amongst other things, con- 
cerning cooks and cookery : " The finger of a good 
cook should alternate perpetually between the stew- 
pan and his mouth, and it is thus in tasting every 
moment, his Eagouts, that he can hit upon the ]Drecise 
medium so as to make him a competent judge of his 
dainty dishes." 

It seems, however, that some did not appreciate 
these high- class French dishes as did others, for I note 
in the work entitled " Antiquitates Culinarias," which 
was published in 1791, that French cookery was called 
"the art of spoiling good meat" and "the art of 
making bad meat eatable." 

The Scotch at this time were, according to a writer, 
very conservative in their cookery and plain in their 
living. It is said that only their fish, oatmeal, and 
whiskey kept them alive. 



THE ART OF COOKERY 19 

At about this time, too, we are informed that the 
"" kitchen staff of a noble establishment " consisted of — 

A yeoman and groom for the cellar. 

A yeoman and groom for the pantry. 

A yeoman and groom for the buttery. 

A yeoman for the ewry. 

A yeoman purveyor. 

A master cook, under-cooks, and pastry-man. 

A yeoman and groom for the scullery, one to be in 
the larder and slaughterhouse. 

An achator, or buyer. 

Three errand boys and three kitchen boys. 

The most interesting cookery book of ancient publi- 
cation is one written by Monsieur Marin in the year 
1738. It was called " Les Dons de Comus." M. 
Marin was cook to the Duchesse de Chaulnes. The 
author, in treating of the science of cookery, says : 
** The science consists in decomposing and in render- 
ing easy of digestion the viands, in extracting from 
them light and nourishing juices, and in so mixing them 
together that no one flavour shall predominate, but that 
all shall be harmonised and blended." 

The first cookery book in a modern language was 
published in Madrid in 1521. Spain has therefore the 
honour of being the pioneer in this direction, and 
claims to the merit of having improved and extended 
the science which recognises the palate, stomach, and 
digestion. It is, however, supposed that an English- 
man, a Mr. Alexander Neckham, wrote a book on 
practical cookery in the twelfth century, and no doubt 
several quaint volumes followed during the succeeding 



20 PEACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

centuries. Italy comes next to Spain for developing the 
culinary art ; but France, although now the nurse of all 
modern cooks, then was in a state of comparative dark- 
ness with regard to cookery. 

In 1569 such articles as '* simnels, buns, cakes, 
biscuits, comfits, caraways, and cracknels " were on 
sale in the bakers' and confectioners' shops in Great 
Britain. 

Li 1580 the delicacies of the Italian table were in- 
troduced into Paris, and from that time the French 
made rapid progress in the culinary art, and thus soon 
surpassed their Italian masters. The first practical 
cookery book of France was published at Rouen in 
1692. Many of its recipes are curious, but nevertheless 
useful. The frequency with which capers are introduced 
is extraordinary, the more so as they rarely make their 
appearance in modern French cookery books, except 
occasionally in entrees or ragouts. The taste for 
foreign dishes and higher dishes in cookery (French) 
made its appearance in England in the seventeenth 
century, and the cookery books of that period reflected 
this by publishing recipes under such titles as "To 
make Portugal dishes," " To make Lady Abergavenny's 
cheese " and " The Countess of Rutland's receipt for 
making the rare Banbury cake," which was as much 
praised as her daughter's pudding. 

The hog barbecued was roasted whole, stuffed with 
spice, and basted with Madeira wine. 

The bill of fare at this time consisted m the month 
of April of the following : —

Closet Opened." Some ten years after, another work 
was published, called the "Ladies' Companion," which 
contained some very cmious instructions as to a lady's 
conduct at the dinner-table. 

The following are a few examples : — 

" Do not lean your elbows on the table." 

" Discover not by any ravenous gesture your angry 

appetite nor fix your eyes too greedily on the meat 

before you, as if you would devour more than your 

throat can swallow." 

" Do not eat spoon-meat so hot that the tears stand 

in your eyes, or that thereby you betray your intolerable 

greediness." 

" Fill not your mouth so full that your cheeks shall 

swell Hke a pair of Scotch bagpipes." 

"It is uncivil to rub your teeth in company, or pick 

them after meals with your knife or otherwise." 

The following advice is given to children : — 

** Avoid smacking your lips in eating." 

" Forbear putting both hands to your mouth at once, 
nor gnaw your meat, but cut it handsomely, and eat 
sparingly." 

"Let your nose and hands be always clean." 

" When you have dined or supped, rise from the 
table and carry your trencher or plate with you, doing 
your obeisance to the company."

The French are justly famed for their skill and taste 
in culinary matters ; they know how to prepare a 
nourishing and palatable dish so that but little alcoholic 
stimulants are required. This probably accounts for 
the saying, " As many Frenchmen as many cooks." 
Yet surrounded as they are by the most delicious 
wines and liqueurs, offering every temptation to render 
drunkenness attractive, it is perhaps true, as the saying 
goes, that a tippling Frenchman is a rara avis, 

England, although now greatly advanced in the 
art of cookery, was, according to early traditions, at 
one time very much behind. From the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth up to the time of the Revolution, the style 
was undoubtedly substantial, and cookery in general 
was coarse and heavy. In Queen Anne's time, how- 
ever, the art of cookery was much improved.

best provision used to consist principally of chines of 
beef and pork, which were sent to the dinner-tables 
smoked and cold. Remains of such joints were sent 
up the next day and washed down with foaming 
tankards of ale. 

The pages of Pope throw an important light on the 
cookery of his time, as well as on the social charac- 
teristics of the epoch. 

"Preach as I please, I doubt our curious men 
Will choose a pheasant still before a hen. 
Yet hens of Guinea feed as good, I hold, 
Except you eat the feathers green and gold 
Of carps and mullets, why prefer the great. 
Though cut in pieces as my lord can eat ? 
Yet for small turbots such esteem profess. 
Because God made these large, the others less. 
Oldfield, with more than harpy throat endued, 
Cries, 'Send me, gods ! a whole hog barbecued.' " 

" The Connoisseur," published in 1754, gives 
reference to the quality of cooking at the Star and 
Garter. " They drove to the ' Star and Garter ' to regale 
on Macaroni, or toyed with ortolans at White's or 
Pontac's. At Dolly's and Horsman's beefsteaks were 
eaten with gill ale." 

" The art of Cookery," by a lady, published in 1765, 
contains several useful recipes. The " Cook's Oracle," 
by Dr. Kitchener, published in 1817, was also a very 
popular work. The best of cookery books which were 
published at that time was undoubtedly that by 



THE ART OF COOKERY 25 

M. Ude. Louis Eustache Ude was an eminent French 
cook : he superintended the kitchens of Louis XVI. 
and the Earl of Sefton. 

The cookery of England is not, generally speaking, 
a thing of luxury and art, but for a plain and at the 
same time substantial meal there can be nothing more 
agreeable than a well-cooked ''English dimier." The 
patriotic Briton has a right to be proud of Thackeray's 
lines, which run as follow : — 

" Dear Lucy, you know what my wish is. 
I hate all your Frenchified fuss ; 
Your silly Entrees and made dishes 
Were never intended for us. 
But a plain leg of mutton, my Lucy, 
I pray thee get ready at three. 
Have it smoking and tender and juicy. 
And what better meat can there be ? " 

There are, however, not two men who will agree as 
to what constitutes a good dinner. 

The father of the late Earl of Dudley, one of the 
most noted gourmands of his time, used to say, " A 
good soup, a small turbot, a neck of venison, duck- 
lings with green peas, or chicken with asparagus, 
and an apricot tart is a dinner for an emperor." 

I certainly agree with him, but should think that 
many would be quite contented with less, and if we never 
dined off anything worse than Lucy's leg of mutton, 
" smoking and tender and juicy," we ought not to 
complain. 



26 PKACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

Who shall say what stupendous issues in the world's 
history have not turned upon good or bad cookery ? It 
has always been a reproach to the English that they are 
behind the rest of the civilised world in respect of cookery. 
A witty Frenchman once spoke of the English as " a 
nation with fifty religions and one sauce." I do not 
think they are as bad as that, and if there is still some 
reproach clinging to their nation in this respect, it is 
proved and admitted by competent judges that a first- 
rate dinner in England is, beyond all comparison, better 
than a dinner of the same class in any other country 
for the following simple reason, that English gold can 
buy the best cooks, just as it can purchase the best 
singers. The greatest cuisinier of his day, L. E. Ude, 
wrote as follows : " I will venture to affirm that cooking 
in England, when well done, is superior to that of any 
other country of the world." 

There is certainly nothing in the French cookery to 
equal an English baron of beef, the noble sirloins^ 
nor haunches, legs, saddles and loins of Southdown 
mutton. The principal articles of food, in the quality of 
which the French surpass the English, are poultry and 
veal ; but such are the skill and science of their cooks that, 
with worse mutton, worse beef, and worse lamb than the 
Enghsh, they produce better made dishes of every kind. 



THE ART OF COOKERY 27 



Feasts and Epicures of Olden Times. 



An old cook gives the following as the ordinary- 
bill of fare for a gentleman's table about Candlemas. 
The first course consisted of cock-a-leekie, a Chatham 
pudding, a fricassee of chicken, a leg of mutton, all 
garnished with barberries ; the second, the more sub- 
stantial, included a chine of mutton, a chine of veal, a 
lark pie, a pullet larded, a pullet plain, all garnished 
with slices of orange ; the third, woodcocks, a couple of 
rabbits, asparagus, a Westphalia gammon ; the fourth, 
two orange tarts, a bacon tart, an apple tart, a tart of 
Bon Chretien pears, a dish of pippins, and a dish of 
pearmains. Still earlier (1470), at a tremendous banquet 
given by the Earl of Warwick to George Neville, his 
brother, upon his being raised to the dignity of Arch- 
bishop of York, the provisions are on a truly Gargantuan 
scale. This is the authentic list of material used on the 
occasion : — 

300 quarters of wheat 400 hernsies 

300 tuns of ale 200 pheasants 

104 tuns of wine 500 partridges 

1 tun of spic'd ale 4,000 woodcocks 
10 fat oxen 400 plovers 

6 wild bulls 100 curlews 

300 pigs 100 quails 

1,004 wethers 1,000 eggets 



28 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

300 hogs 200 rees 

300 calves 4,000 bucks, does, and roebucks 

3,000 geese 155 hot venison pasties 

3,000 capons 1,000 dishes of jellies 

100 peacocks 4,000 cold venison pasties 

200 cranes 2,000 hot custards 

200 kids 4,000 cold custards 

2,000 chickens 400 tarts 

4,000 pigeons 300 pikes 

4,000 rabbits 300 breams 

204 bitterns 8 seals 

4,000 ducks 4 porpoises 

It is not surprising to learn that such a vast pantry 
required for its working 1,000 cooks, 62 kitcheners, and 
515 scullions. Massinger, in " The City Madam," gives 
us incidentally a glimpse of the extravagance of material 
of which our forefathers were guilty. The old steward 
grumbles — 

* ' Men may talk of country Christmases and Court gluttony, 
Their thirty pound buttered eggs, their pies of carps' 

tongues, 
Their pheasants dressed with ambergris, the carcasses 
Of three fat wethers bruised for gravy, to 
Make sauce for a single peacock." 

Yet all that, he says, is nothing — merely " fasts " — 
compared with the City feasts. It is enough to make 
one pause and to provoke to an invective anent the 
decadence of all that is virtuous to read that in the 
thirteenth century a rabbit and a lamb each cost the 
same, fourpence to wit ; that a turbot was to be 
obtained for sixpence, a salmon for three shillings, a 



THE ART OF COOKERY 29 

fat hog for three shillings and f ourpence, and a fat sheep 
for one shilling and twopence. In those halcyon days 
twenty eggs could be bought for a penny, you could 
indulge in a swan for fourpence, and wash the banquet 
down with ale at three halfpence the gallon ! 

Amongst the dishes of the middle ages we find 
mention, in a catalogue of extras suitable for a grand 
and formal repast, of *' an umble pie." This dish, 
provided for those " below the salt," was composed 
of the " umbles," or entrails, of the deer, and anti- 
quaries claim to have found in it the origin of the 
colloquial phrase of to-day — "to eat humble pie." 
But it is among the ancients that we must look for 
the really heroic days of feasting and eating. In quite 
early time the appetite seems to have been simply 
voracious, unstimulated as it was by the refinements 
of luxury to which the Romans attained. Theogenes 
and Milo are both credited with having devoured an 
ox at a single sitting ; Astydamas of Miletus ate for 
supper portions quite as large ; Canubis, of Lydia, is 
not the only potentate believed to have been guilty of 
cannibalism. To come to later times, Fuller relates 
the case of one Nicholas Wood who, in providing for 
a feast, was considered a culinary artist, and rose in 
importance. To be indifferent to the description of 
food served up was to wound this personage in his 
tenderest feelings. The Duke of Wellington lost the 
services of a good chef for no other reason than that 
he was careless regarding the quality of his meals. 
" I cannot stay with him," said the wounded artist. 



80 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

" I cook him a dinner fit for the king, he say nothing ! 
I go out, and leave the dinner to ze stupid cookmaid 
— again he say nothing." A more pomted rebuke was 
administered to the Duke by the celebrated epicure 
Cambaceres, who invited him to a banquet, and, piqued 
at his not praising the excellence of the cuisine, asked 
his opinion of some particular dish. " It is very good," 
was the reply, " but, to tell the truth, I hardly know 
what I eat." The disgusted epicure cried, "then why 
did you come to dine with me ? " 

Besides the indifferent and the abnormal, some 
persons possess what may be called a diseased appetite. 
Tastes differ widely regarding food. Many persons 
would not object to partake of the meal Kmg James 
said he would provide " for the devil if he asked him t© 
dinner " — pork and "a pipe for digestion." I will not 
dwell on cannibal banquets, nor on the peculiar method 
of the interment of a husband's ashes practised by the 
Queen of Mausolus. The old " fire-eaters," so common 
at country fairs a generation ago, professed to find a 
supportmg diet in fuel and flames. Among the many 
attacks made upon Dr. Johnson after his acceptance of 
a pension from the Government was one purporting to 
be written by a famous '* fire-eater " at Bartholomew 
Fair. He complains that Dr. Johnson has been 
rewarded for ** writing well," and Sheridan for " speak- 
ing well," but that he himself has received nothing for 
" eating well." This unappreciated genius declares that 
his favourite mess is "brimstone and fire," and that if 



THE ART OF COOKERY 31 

he came into a kitchen where a sirloin was roasting 
he would " eat up the fire and leave the beef." This 
taste was even stranger than that of the " stone-eater" 
mentioned at Avignon. His keepers professed to have 
discovered him on a desert island, where he was 
subsisting wholly upon " large flints and such marbles 
and stones as he could make into a paste, which was 
to him a most surporting and wholesome food." When 
brought to France he was induced to eat sparingly of 
raw meat, but refused bread and vegetables. Possessors 
of appetites like these might at least rely on being 
able to feed themselves cheaply, the stone-eater 
boarding himself more economically than the votary 
of tobacco — 

" Who hath his roast-meat in a box, 
And on a pipe can dine." 

As a rule, an appetite and the means of gratifying it 
are too often separated. An old Scotch nurse was wont 
to repeat the following lines as grace before meat : — 

" Some have meat, 
But cannot eat ; 
And some can eat, 
But have no meat ; 
But we have meat, 
And we can eat. 
And so the Lord be thankit." 

Many prescriptions have been given for accommo- 
dating appetite and supply from Franklin's famous 



32 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

mess of gruel, with bread crumbled in it (which pro- 
fessed to be, like Sam Weller's crumpets, so " filling at 
the price "), down to the " cheap living " recipe of an 
American, who advised his readers to " first eat two 
cents' worth of dried apples ; afterwards drink a quart 
of water to swell the apples." 



The Tongue and the Sense of Taste. 



The tongue is not the only organ used in the enjoy- 
ment of the sense of taste, and alone it is scarcely 
capable of appreciating delicate flavours. 

The difference between salt and sugar when placed 
on the tongue is hardly perceptible, provided the tongue 
is not allowed to touch the roof of the mouth and the 
lips. Indeed, the act of the getting the full enjoyment 
of a flavour, commonly called smacking the lips, consists 
in bringing the tongue into contact with the roof of the 
mouth and the lips. By this act the substance to be 
tasted is spread over the surfaces of these parts, par- 
ticularly of the tongue, and mixed with the saUva. 

How this act produces taste is not exactly known ; 
but we do know that the tongue is covered with two 



THE ART OF COOKERY 33 

layers of skin — the lower one thick and filled with nerves, 
and the upper one thin and porous. The nerves in the 
lower skin are the nerves of taste, and probably are set 
into vibration by the substance tasted, very much as the 
exquisitely sensitive nerves of the ear by sound. At all 
events the sense is conveyed to the brain, where we 
involuntarily distinguish between pleasant and disagree- 
able tastes. 

The nerves, moreover, of the tongue are not all 
alike. In the tip of the tongue they are clustered to- 
gether more closely than at the back, and transfer to 
the brain a different sensation. For instance, a little 
powdered alum placed on the back of the tongue tastes 
sweet, whereas on the tip it tastes acid. 

The sense of taste is an almost certain guide to the 
wholesomeness of foods, and a monitor which warns us 
when we are in danger of swallowing any injurious or 
poisonous substance. 

Poisons, as a rule, are extremely disagreeable to the 
taste, and it requires an effort to overcome the natural 
repugnance to them. Hence it is that accidental 
poisoning so rarely occurs. 

In the case of foods we soon tire of a thing as a 
regular diet, and the taste craves a change. Here the 
whole system rebels against the monotony of diet be- 
cause no one food is likely to contain all the elements of 
nutrition required by the body for the exercise of its 
functions, and soon the elements which are in excess 
cloy upon the taste, because the system is already sup- 



34 



PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 



plied with them while we crave the foods containing 
substances which the system lacks. A change is then 
demanded by Nature, and made manifest by the sense of 
taste. 

If the change cannot be made, Nature shows her dis- 
approval by causing a loss of appetite, or a repugnance 
to the condemned article of diet. 

Again, in the case of foods which are much concen- 
trated, or have a strong flavour, like preserved fruits or 
syrups, the taste soon becomes dulled to the pleasure of 
their sweetness, because the dehcate nerves which con- 
vey the impression of sweetness to the brain become 
fatigued, and fail to respond to the exciting cause.

PART II. 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 



The word "cook" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon, 
coc. Danish, Kok ; German, Koch ; French, cuisinier ; 
Italian, cuoco ; and Latin, cocus, coquus, from coquere, 
to cook. The word '* cock" has also the same deriva- 
tion in Great Britain, coc ; and in France also, coq. 

In Roman -Latin the Frenchman ^ was Gallus, a 
Gaul, and, from some arrangement peculiar to the 
Romans, gallus is the Latin for ** cock." 

The cook in Plautus is called " Hominum Serva- 
tor," the server of mankind ; and by Mercier " un 
medecinqui guerit radicalement deux maladies mortelles, 
la faim et la soif " (a doctor who radically cures two 
mortal complaints, viz. hunger and thirst). 

In William the Norman Conqueror's time the cook 
was styled " Magnus Coquus." In 1248 the brother 
of Cardinal Otto, the Pope's legate, officiated as cook, 
and was then called" Magister Coquinus." 

In the times of our forefathers, cooks were thought 



36 PKACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

a great deal more of than they are now ; the rarity of 
their talents was so well understood that, besides receiv- 
ing a very considerable compensation, they were titled 
" Esquire " by their office. 

Their important posts were always held as situations 
of high trust and confidence ; so that " magni coqui " 
(master kitcheners) have filled positions of consider- 
able dignity, in their time, in the palaces of kings 
and princes. 

William the Conqueror bestowed several portions of 
land upon these highly favoured domestics, the Co- 
quorum Praepositus and Coquus Eegius. Robert 
Argillon, a cook, had a manor bestowed on him for the 
services he rendered. Domesday's Book refers to this 
honour as follows : — 

** Robert Argillon holdeth one carucate of land in 
Addington in the county of Surrey by the service of 
making one mess in an earthen pot in the kitchen of 
our lord the King on the day of his coronation, called 
' de la groute,' i.e. a kind of plum-porridge or water- 
gruel with plums in it. This dish is still served up at 
the royal table at coronations by the lord of the said 
manor of Addington." 

At the coronation of King George IV., Court of 
Claims, July 12, 1820, the petition of the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbm'y, which was presented by Sir G. 
Nayler, claiming to perform the service of presenting 
a dish of ''de la groute " to the King at the banquet, 
was considered by the Court, and decided to be allowed. 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 37 

One of the great triumphs of the ancient cooks was 
to serve up a whole pig, boiled on one side and roasted 
on the other. The guests tried m vain to detect the 
place where the knife had separated the animal, or how 
it was contrived to stuff it with an olio composed of 
thrushes and other birds, slices of sow, hens, and highly 
spiced minced meat, the whole flavoured with a rich 
juice or sauce. 

These old cooks could with a vegetable counterfeit 
the taste of fish or flesh. 

It is reported that in an expedition against the 
Scythians in the winter, and at a great distance from 
the sea, the King of Bithynia had a violent longing for 
a pilchard. His cook cut a turnip in exact imitation of 
its shape, then fried it in oil, salted and well powdered 
it with the grains of a dozen black poppies, and his 
Majesty's taste was so exquisitely deceived that he 
praised the root to his guests as an excellent fish. 

This seeming transmutation of vegetables into fish 
is a great art, but in these days it appears to have gone 
out of practice ; it might with advantage be revived, 
especially in countries where much cheap and wholesome 
food is lost or wasted, because an adequate knowledge 
of cookery is wanting. 

The ancient cooks sent almost to the ends of the 
earth for choice viands which were not obtainable at 
home. Those of Athens, for instance, procured from 
England their oysters, of which the finest came from 
the neighbourhood of Sandwich. Juvenal records 



38 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

that the epicure Montaniis could tell by his first bite at 
an oyster whether it was English or not. 

" Man is a cooking animal." Such was the defini- 
tion of the human species which Boswell on a certain 
occasion gave to Edwin Burke. 

'* The beasts," continued Boswell, "■ have memory, 
judgment, and all the faculties and passions of our 
own mind in a certain degree, but no beast is a cook." 

Would that we could supplement that dictum of old 
Dr. Johnson's trumpeter by saying that the reverse 
holds true. But what man is there who can lay his 
hand on his heart and solemnly declare that something 
in the above is not true ? What one of us is there who 
has not had cause to anathematise his cook, and in a 
moment of righteous wrath felt a fiendish desire to 
inflict upon that functionary the doom of Richard Rose, 
the Bishop of Rochester's murderous cook, who was 
" boiled " to death at Smithfield ? 

Who shall say what stupendous issues in the world's 
history have not turned upon good or bad cookery? 
Most of us have heard of the famous black broth of 
Sparta, but few know, or are familiar with, its origin. 
" I am not astonished," exclaimed a native of Sybaris 
(the Pares of the Greek gourmand), after tasting it, 
" that you Spartans are so fearless of death on the 
battle-field, since anyone in his senses would rather 
die than be compelled to live on such execrable food." 
Bad cooking, then, may have been responsible for the 
Spartan courage. 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 39 

Look, again, at Napoleon the Great. When he 
fought the disastrous battle of Leipsic he was suf- 
fering frightfully from indigestion caused by eating 
underdone meat (veal cutlets). Had those cutlets 
been properly cooked, who knows but the issue of 
that three days' fight might have been different ? 

This surely gives us sufficient reason for saying 
that bad cooking has had something to do in 
bringmg about the collapse of the terrible bogey 
of Europe at that time. It is a most serious thing 
to reflect upon this, for good and evil lie in the hands 
of a cook ! 

There are, I fear, but few so conscientious as poor 
Vatel, the chef of the Prince de Conde, who ran him- 
self through the heart with his sword because the fish 
had not arrived in time for a great banquet, at which 
Louis XIV., le Grand Monarque himself, was to be 
present. 

On the "Manuel des Amphitryons " Grimod de la 
Reyni^re observes compassionately that we enjoy the 
result of the works of our cooks, without considering 
the cost of the ineffable enjoyment they procure for us, 
and without reflecting that they only derive, from their 
incessant exertions, impaired health and means of sub- 
sistence that are often precarious and often moderate. 
"They spend their best days in heat and obscurity, 
and their last in poverty too often bordering on 
destitution." 

" A good meal is one of the greatest enjoyments of 



40 PEACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

human life," and greater regard for those who prepare 
them ought, in many cases, to be shown ; as the practice 
of cooking is attended with so many difficulties, so 
many disagreeable circumstances, and even dangers, it 
is but right that we should endeavour to render the 
situation of the cook as comfortable and agreeable as 
possible. 

The chef, to whom the management of the kitchen 
is confided, is a great power in the house, for no one 
can be more instrumental to make the reputation of a 
house than the chef. He should be the ideal of per- 
fection to the other servants, who, after the manner of 
other employees, are more steadily praised into good 
conduct and discipline than scolded at. The chef 
should always commend his staff when they do well. 
Judicious approval will often convert an ordinary 
servant into a good one. 

How much force there is in the old couplet — 

"Be to their faults a little blmd, 
And to their virtues very kind." 

It is always wisest for a cook, man or woman, to be 
on pleasant terms with the servants of an establish- 
ment, especially with those who wait at table, as this 
will often help to please the diner, as he will know 
what dishes are liked, and whether the work has pleased 
in the dining-room. There are many who have the 
supervision of waiting who frequently have it in their 
power, not only to contribute much towards the satis- 
faction of the guests, but also to contribute to the 
cook's ideas, who is often at a loss as to how he can 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 41 

please them. No cook should ever think any part of 
his business too trifling to be well done. 

Although no one has ever succeeded in pleasing all 
palates, because the tastes are almost as different as 
faces, yet palates must be studied by the cook, and if 
he be industrious and energetic he will with tact soon 
acquire a knowledge of the particular tastes of his 
patrons. 

The palate of a cook must be in the highest state 
of perfection, so that the least fault in cooking may be 
perceived in a moment. 

To succeed as some of our great chefs have suc- 
ceeded, a cook must not only be a cook, he must be a 
draughtsman, a sculptor, and a colourist ; and the time 
and taste which a cook spends on the arts of design 
to prepare food for the eye are so much time and 
taste diverted from the more important business of 
preparing food for the mouth. 

The most experienced artists in cookery cannot be 
certain of their work without " tasting." The spoon of 
a good cook is continually passing from the stewpan to 
his tongue, and only frequent tasting the sauces &c. 
can discover to him what progress he makes, or enable 
him to season a soup or ragout with certainty of 
success. 

The constant fumes and heat of the stove neces- 
sitate frequent drinking to moisten the parched-up 
throat ; and this is done in most cases with the aid of 
alcoholic drinks, which often cause a man to lose his 
head, and, alas ! his taste, the organs of which are 



42 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

thus quickly vitiated, and the palate becomes blunt. 
It cannot be too strongly advised to every cook to 
abstain while he is at work from drinks which are 
excitable ; there are so many harmless drinks, such as 
lemonade, gingerbeer, soda and milk, cold tea, coffee 
TN-ith milk, syrups with water, &c., which will quench 
the thirst in a hot kitchen, so that one need not avail 
himself of intoxicants. Common beer quenches the 
thirst only momentarily, and will soon give rise to a 
craving for more. Claret, although an intoxicant, is 
considered the best drink of any to allay thirst, but it 
must be mixed with plenty of water, when it is 
practically unintoxicating. 

Honesty, cleanliness, and economy should be the 
first items of a cook's study. It is of the utmost im- 
portance in a cook to be honest ; and to obtain and 
preserve, in spite of the many temptations to which 
he is exposed, a character for firmness and spotless 
integrity, for this will help towards obtaining inde- 
pendence. " Cleanliness is next to godUness " is a 
very old saying, and cannot be more appropriately 
apphed than here. Cleanliness and proper ventilation, 
to carry off smoke, smell, and steam, are the first con- 
siderations in a kitchen. The stove, which is, so to 
speak, the grand scene of action, should be so placed as 
to be accessible to light and ventilation. There are, 
however, many kitchens where such is not the case, and 
the poor cook is continually bathed with his, or her, 
perspiration. No place has a greater need for cleanUness 
than the kitchen : it is here that dirt and untidiness 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 43 

are much more conspicuous than in any other part of 
an estabhshment. Cleanliness is the most essential 
ingredient in the art of cooking, and at any sacrifice 
should be maintained in the kitchen. 

All connected with cookery should make it the rule 
to be economical, to endeavour to make the most of 
everything. There is perhaps no country where the 
study of economy in the kitchen is more needed than 
in England. Here we must take the French for our 
example. A French housewife will, say, with 40 francs 
be able to supply the table for a week with every 
comfort and luxury, and in addition save something out 
of the 40 francs, whilst the English housewife will 
hardly meet the wants with 40 shillings a week for 
meals of the plainest kind. The better a cook the 
more economy he will practise : this is one reason why 
there is more waste among the poor and middle classes, 
where the cooking is done by so-called plain cooks, who 
are ignorant of the art of cookery. These will throw 
away what an educated cook will turn into a seasonable 
dish. Time, however, will mend these wants, for 
already the schools have taken up the education of 
cookery, so that ere long children will learn as a part of 
their elementary education how to cook with economy. 
A little forethought in these matters will soon show the 
real meaning of economy. Scraps of meat or fish, fag- 
ends of bacon, so often wasted, with a little judicious 
management make, when re-dressed in a different form 
to what they were first served, tasty little dishes, which 
improve the appearance of the table with very little 
extra cost. 3 



44 PRACTICAL GASTEONOMY 

Every cook has his own style of preparing and 
dressing a dinner. Some will study the elegance of 
dishing up, to the detriment of the modes of prepara- 
tion ; whilst others, on the contrary, will aim at refining 
the preparation, and thhik little of the elegance. Both 
are wrong. A good dish must be presented in an 
attractive form ; but there is excess in everything, 
and too much art m cooking may be as fatal as too 
little. 

An ingenious cook may form varieties as endless as 
a musician with his instrument or as a painter with his 

colours. 

The study of cookery books, their rules and recipes, 
are of little use unless the practising party has the 
natural gift for perfect cookery. To arrive at perfection 
in culinary art means to be able to make a perfect 
sauce, and a cook who is proficient in sauce-making 
must possess the most delicate skill for roasting. To 
merely make up a dish from a recipe is in comparison 
like dispensing from a prescription. The chemist, like 
the cook, will weigh or measure every ingredient em- 
ployed, with the exception that the former rarely or 
never tastes his preparations, whilst the latter must 
taste, and possess that power of judging of, say, a sauce 
which requires reducing where the flavour increases as 
the sauce simmers away. 

It would be blind work indeed for a cook to do 
without tasting ; the very best soups would be quite 
flavourless if the seasonings were omitted. Seasoning 
in cookery is what chords are in music ; the best 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 45 

instruments in the hands of the best professors without 
their being in tune would be insipid. 

A good cook, besides being versed in the technique 
of the kitchen, should also be a good judge of the 
kinds, qualities, and uses of every dietary article. The 
old Greek comic poet Dionysius says : — 

"To roast some beef, to carve with neatness, 
To boil up sauces, and to blow the fire, 
Is anybody's task ; he who does this 
Is but a seasoner and a broth-maker. 
A cook is quite another thing. His mind 
Must comprehend all facts and circumstances, 
Where is the place, and what the time of supper ; 
Who are the guests, and who the entertainer ; 
What fish he ought to buy, and where he ought to 
buy it," etc. 

"A cook can be made, whilst a roaster is born." 
These were the words of Brillat-Savarin. There is 
much reason in this argument, for it is an art indeed to 
possess the qualification of an artist in cookery. It is 
easier to compose an operatic piece than to invent a new 
dish, and even man who has the natural endowments 
would find it more easy to qualify himself to compete 
with the Royal Academicians than with the chief 
operators in cookery. 

In confirming these facts we cannot do better than 
follow the quotations of the Marquis de Cussy, who re- 
modelled the aphorism of Brillat-Savarin, thus : — 

" On devient cuisinier ; 
On devient rotisseur 
On nait saucier." 



46 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

On following closely these words we come to the 
conclusion, and not without reasons, "that one can 
learn to cook and be taught to roast ; but to become a 
saucier needs the gift of a genius." 

The cook is our best friend during his active life, 
but how soon is he forgotten when he can no longer 
cater for our gastronomic pleasures ! But a different 
era to that is coming soon ; cooks will then no longer 
be ranked as " mere cooks " amongst their entrees and 
souffles, for cooking has been raised to the degree of a 
fine art, and if not now, yet soon it will be seen that 
cooks in England as well as other countries will be 
recognised as somethmg infinitely superior to an upper 
servant. There are already many names which crop up 
for us in spiritual array of their aristocracy of cooking 
who have made and are making at present their infiuence 
felt to the exaltation of the art, fo^ by that very force 
and power of making itself felt that the real art has 
possessed, even amongst those who pretend to know, but 
do not, the art of cooking will take a higher standard so 
rapidly as its pupils are raised with it. 

Careme, Soyer, Ude, Vatel, Urbain Dubois, Emile 
Bernard, Francatelli, Gouffe, Vassant, Tavenet, and 
others have all spoken out ; but most of what they 
have said on this subject has been disregarded because 
their fellows in the art of cookery regarded them as 
premature when they were merely learned members of 
the profession. 

The cooks of the present day have a glorious task 



THE COOK AND THE KITCHEN 47 

before them ; it is to make their art and profession felt, 
respected, and ennobled by the power of skill and care 
they will devote to its development. Colleges of cookery 
have of late been established in France and Switzerland, 
and such institutions are sure to follow in England, 
America, and other countries ; it is therefore no idle 
dream to believe that the time is not far distant when 
the cook shall be personally as highly appreciated and 
valued as the dishes he prepares. 



The Eariy Use of the Word '* Kitchen." 

The etymology of "kitchen" is rather mixed: 
in French it is cuisine ; Italian, cucina ; in Latin, 
coquina ; and in German Kilche. We find that in 
Saxon it is cycane ; in Welsh, cequin ; in Danish, 
Kicekhen; and in Scotch, kyshen. Hence the names 
in German, Saxon, Danish, and Scotch resemble 
more the homely English word of "kitchen." The 
word itself seems to be in English an adaptation 
of the Latin coqtdna : it denotes the place where food 
is cooked. Some of our ancient authors refer to the 
word " kitchen " at very early dates. Thus Aristotle, 



48 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

in B.C. 329, writes : " It is less a rebuke for a man to 
be busy to know what is done in his kitchen than 
for a woman to know what is done without her house." 
Then, again, in 1590, Spencer says : — 

* 'They both attone. 
Did outie to their lady as became, 
Who passing byforth led her guests anone 
Unto the kitchen roome, ne spared for nicenesse none." 

In the poem of " Piers the Ploughman " there is the 
following passage : " Ich be cook in here kitchen." 
Geoffrey Chaucer, who lived in the 14th century, writing 
in " The Wyf of Bathe's Tale," speaks of " blessing 
halles, chambers, kitchens and boures, cities and burghs, 
castels hihe and toures." 

Shakespeare writes is his " Comedy of Errors " : — 

*' There is a fat frind at your master's house that 
kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner, "j 

Some of the culinary affairs of yore disclose most 
en^dous facts in connection with cooks and kitchens ; for 
instance, there is a book mth the kitchens of the olden 
time, strange tricks and fancies, called " Porta's Natural 
Magicke." It gives directions as to the ways of roasting 
and boiling a fowl at the same time, so that one half 
shall be roasted and the other boiled, and concludes 
that, should you have a lack of cooks, there is a way 
of persuading a goose — how to roast himself. 



THE EARLY USE OF THE WORD "KITCHEN 



49 



Here is a recipe to make a *• Sauce for a Goose," 
A.D. 1381 : " Take a faire panne, and set him under the 
goose whill she rostes : and kepeclane the grese that 
droppes thereof, and put therto a godele [good deal] of 
Wyn, and a litel \dnegur, and verjus, and onyons 
mynced or garleek, then take the gottes of the goose 
and slitt horn, and scrape horn alone in water and salt, 
and so wash horn, and hack horn small, then do all 
this to gadur in a piffenet and do thereto raisinges and 
corance, pouder of pepur and of ginger and of canell, 
and hole clowes and maces, and let hit boyle and serve 
hit forthe."

Maxims for the Kitchen. 



A good cook is a jewel of priceless value. 

A good cook is known by her boiled potatoes. 

Abolish the frying pan for cooking meat. 

Don't fly at too high game. 

Better one good dish than several badly cooked 
ones. 

In cooking a joint remember the main thing is to 
keep the juices as much as possible in the meat. 

Try to please the eye as well as the taste. 

The purpose of good cooking is not so much to gratify 
the palate as to aid the digestion. 

Badly cooked meals are the source of many dis- 
eases. 

A well-cooked dinner will save many a matrimonial 
jar. 

To know only a " little " of cookery is a dangerous 
thing. 

There are scientific principles underlying the art of 
cookery which must be mastered before a cook really 
knows his business. 

When the first principles of cookery are once 
mastered, the cook will be able to evolve his own 
conclusions.

" A maxim, too, that must not be forgot : 
Whatever be your dinner, ' serve it hot.*

" Three dishes well dressed, and welcome with all. 
Both pleaseth thy friend, and becometh thine hall."

Eating and Drinking among the Turks 

The Turkish cuisine must be tasted to be appreciated. 
The basis of all culinary operations in Stamboul is a 
certain kind of tallow extracted from the broad and 
thick extremity of the Caraman sheep. This tallow has 
an odour so potent that we would not use it even for 
candles. The Turks are essentially vegetarians. They 
eat beef very rarely, and never pork or veal. They in- 
dulge in ducks, lean fowls, and fiUany sheep, the flesh 
of which they cut off in small pieces. These pieces are 
strung upon long spits, which are held and turned for 
some minutes over hot coals, where they are slowly 
roasted, retaining all their juices. This is what is called 
kebab y a healthful and nutritious food which Europeans 



EATING AND DEINKING AMONG THE TURKS 59 

find delicious. Turkish pastry is quite varied, and 
would not be disagreeable if honey and sugar were not 
used so abundantly, and if the taste of tallow could be 
excluded. Bahalava and ehmek kataif (thick cakes in 
honey, perfumed with rose-water and covered with 
caimak, a kind of cream), in particular, recall very 
savoury memories. Pachas and rich Turks always 
have at their repasts a great number of dishes, which 
the servants bring in on brass platters, and place on the 
mat on the floor, or sometimes on small low tables 
around which the guests squat. They eat in a grave 
manner, and help themselves generally with their 
fingers as well as with forks, and with their teeth as 
well as with their knives. Nevertheless, they deign to 
use a spoon to convey to their mouths food that is not 
very solid, like stewed rice, malehy (a kind of cooked 
cream), and iaourt (thick and bitterish milk), all of which 
they are very fond of. Their drink consists of clear 
water, but this does not prevent them from imbibing 
before their repast a white liquor, raki, which is made 
of the gum of the mastic-tree mixed with alcohol. It 
is an agreeable drink, but it is used like absinthe, the 
taste and properties of which it possesses. Its use, and 
even its abuse, does not bring remorse to the conscience 
of the Turks, for Mohammed has forbidden them to use 
wine, but he forgot, prophet though he was, to foresee 
the manufacture of raki, an invention more modern than 
his own. 



60 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 



Chinese Diet and Custom. 

If a visitor is invited to dinner in China, custom 
orders that when the invitation is given he shall receive 
from the host certain advice as to conduct, such as — 
** Do not eat with noise ; do not crunch the bones with 
your teeth, nor drink down the sauces at a gulp." This 
is said seriously, and seriously received. 

If the master of the house is a person of importance, 
and offers to his guest fruit with stones or pips, such as 
peaches or oranges, the guest must put the pips in his 
pocket, in order not to appear to refuse anything the 
host is good enough to offer. If a melon is served, the 
manner of cutting it depends upon the caste to which 
the cutter belongs. 

Sentiments are regulated by custom as well as 
expression. Thus, if in the course of a visit refresh- 
ments are offered to the guest, he must drink the first 
cup " with an air of profound thought," the second 
" with a satisfied expression." 

A member of a Bremen trading house lately had the 
honour of taking dinner with a Chinese magnate in 
Pekin, and has given the following appetising descrip- 
tion of the feast. The table was set with twenty-two 
dishes, and was lit with ten large lanterns, the light of 
which shone clear through brightly coloured shades and 



CHINESE DIET AND CUSTOM 61 

ornaments. Instead of being served in courses, the 
dishes were brought in one at a time and passed to the 
guests severally, beginning with the most distinguished. 
His comments are as follows : — 

1. Doves with mushrooms and split bamboo sprouts. 
Delicious. 

2. Fat pork fritters or something like fritters. 
Splendid. 

3. Pigeons' eggs in meat broth, the whites hard but 
transparent. Very good. 

4. Chinese birds' nests, with ham chips and bam- 
boo sprouts (a mucilaginous dish). Excellent. 

5. Poultry, different kinds, cooked with mushrooms 
and bamboo sprouts. Very agreeable. 

6. Duck, with bamboo and lotus fruits, the fruits 
tasting and looking like an acorn without its cup. Toler- 
ably good. 

7. Hog's liver fried in castor oil. Bad. 

8. A Japanese dish of mussels, with malodorous 
codfish and bacon. Horrible. 

9. Sea-crabs' tails cooked in castor oil, with bits of 
bamboo and ham. Would have been palatable but for 
the wretched oil. 

10. A star made of pieces of fowl, bacon, and dove, 
covered with white of egg. Very juicy. 



62 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

11. Slices of sera-fish and sharks' fins, with bamboo 
and mushrooms. It was hard to tell what kind of a 
dish it was, but it was rather bad than good. 

12. Giblets of poultry with morels. The morels 
helped the giblets down. 

13. Ham and cabbage. Not very good. 

14. Ham of sucking pigs, cooked in their own juice. 

A pause now ensued, during which pipes and tobacco 
were brought in. The pipes held about a thimbleful of 
tobacco — enough for two or three pufi's — and we were 
kept busy filling and lighting them. 

15. Land- turtles, -vvdth their eggs, in castor oil. 

16. Ends of ham. Good. 

17. Breast of fowl, with sour cabbage. No delicacy. 

18. Stale eggs (these eggs had been kept one month 
in salt and two months in moist earth). The whites 
looked like burned sugar, and were transparent. The 
yolks had a greenish colour, and the embryos appeared 
dark, rolled together, and perfectly recognisable. 

Dessert : Conserve of sitzon, a red fruit that looks 
like a shadberry, and tastes like a currant. Good. 

The only drink was tea, very weak and without 
sugar, and Jamion, a rice wine, which is drunk hot like 
tea, and is wretched stuff.

PART III 

HIGH-CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKERY 
Of the Present Time. 



All that appertains to the delicate and valuable science 
of cookery, in its highest and most artistic form, is the 
result and study of the masters of that craft, who, we 
are bound to admit, have of late produced marvellous 
improvements by providing what " is pleasant to the eye 
and good for food." The modern high-class cooks are 
at once artists, architects, and physicians : they appeal 
to our senses of colour, of fragrance, of form, and of taste, 
and, recognising that truth, the condition of our souls 
is largely dependent on the state of our stomachs. Their 
inventive genius is displayed in multitudinous methods 
for what we may call the artistic presentation of nutri- 
ment. They can build castles and cathedrals out of 
cooked meats, flour, rice, and sugar ; they can fashion 
all the flowers that bloom in the sprmg out of deftly 
moulded stearine crystals or carved vegetable roots ; they 



66 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

can form all the delicate pieces of a table decoration, and 
the judicious composition of a well-balanced bill of fare ; 
they work like dramatists and think like doctors, for, 
after all, the " secret " of a dinner means good dialogue 
on the part of the company, hence the culinary artist is 
the real physician of modern life. So much for the 
artists and the "haute cuisine " ; but it is also most 
necessary that the importance of good cooking be like- 
wise recognised in " every-day life." It is here that 
cookery in many cases is still shamefully mismanaged, 
and the extravagance and discomfort resulting from bad 
cooking are beyond restraint. 

It is often said that a French cook can serve up a 
most savoury dish of a few crusts of bread and scraps 
of meat and a little spice. I do not know how true 
this may be, but I am quite sure that the English cook, 
with a little more judicious management and proper use 
of the material, ought to be just as capable of serving up 
as palatable, nutritious, and economical dishes as the 
French. Eleven women out of twelve have daily some- 
thing to do with preparing food for the table, and if 
more regard were shown for such an important matter 
as the art of cooking, not nearly so much food which is 
entrusted to them would be spoiled. 

It sounds very fine, no doubt, to place one's self 
above these lower considerations of material existence, 
to profess indifference as to the tenderness of a joint, 
or the savouriness of hashes and stews, and to declare 
that, so long as one has enough to stop the animal 



HIGH-CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKERY 67 

craving for nourislament, it is of little importance whether 
the food be dressed in an appetising manner or not. 
Cooking, in the vocabulary of six women out of eight, 
means waste, inefficiency, and discomfort ; many may 
think this exaggeration, but such is not the case, as we 
shall see when we consider how much is spent on food, 
how much is wasted by inefficient management, and how 
much of that might be saved by proper management. 
Among the many important reasons for and advantages 
of good cooking there are three essential ones : first, it 
prevents waste ; second, it is necessary for health ; last, 
but by no means of the least importance, it has much 
effect upon the temper and actions of weak mortals. 

Proper knowledge of the functions of food and their 
respective preparations of cooking would save many 
pounds a year ; it would provide better comfort, better 
houses, and higher education. It is distressing to note 
in the homes of the poor, and even in some of the 
houses of the middle classes, how excessive are the 
ignorance and the wastefulness in cooking. 

Luxury is common among all classes, and very 
often more so than is needed. But it is not luxury I 
wish to advocate ; indeed, most of those who can afford 
to keep up an expensive table generally secure the 
service of first-rate cooks who are well acquainted with 
the rudiments and true secrets of cookery ; there should, 
however, be a method for the cooking of every-day life 
between the luxurious display of delicacies daintily 
prepared by skilful man-cooks, and the badly cooked 



68 PBACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

and unpalatable dishes with which the lower and 
middle classes have to be content. 

It is but a right and reasonable ambition for any 
young woman to desire to make herself a mistress of 
the art of cooking. It is not essential that, because she 
is proficient in it, she is to devote her time to cooking 
meals. It is far more conducive, indeed, to domestic 
comfort for the mistress to take no practical part in 
making the dishes, yet she ought to know how they are 
prepared, if she is to direct. A word or two of criticism 
to the cook, a hint as to some improvement, will show 
the cook that her mistress is efficient in the art, and she 
cannot afford to ignore her remarks ; such will be the 
results when a practical and thorough knowledge in the 
management has been obtained. Those who understand 
the necessity of good cooking recognise one of the 
natural but at the same time most important require- 
ments of home comfort. It should not be for their own 
sake that they make it a point of study, for often women 
care little about the pleasures of the table. It is for the 
sake of their husbands, sons, or brothers, whose comfort 
depends upon her good management. Sensible women 
will not think it prudent to look with disdain on the 
masculine inclination for good fare ; for such weakness 
they will readily overcome. Who knows better than a 
sensible woman that a man's physical welfare affects 
his mental and moral condition, and understands the 
connection between an appetising dinner and an 
amiable frame of mind ? Good cooking, too, is necessary 



HIGH-CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKERY 69' 

for the preservation of health. However plain the food 
may be, it must be treated properly, or it will fail to 
nourish, and be productive of that dread enemy, in- 
digestion. There are rules and reason for everything 
done in cooking as much as in any other art, and upon 
the observance of these rules depends success. 

Sameness is one of the least serious charges to be 
brought against the cooking of an ordinary middle - 
class family, though greater variety would be more 
agreeable ; there are generally worse evils — bad cook- 
ing and serving up indigestible and wasteful dishes. 
The greater efficiency of man-cooks has been attributed, 
and certamly not without reason, to the better know- 
ledge of the method : much more than women they 
work by rule ; they rely on the clock, the scales, and 
carefully tested recipes. It is not always profound 
knowledge that is necessary ; great care, more delibera- 
tion, and better method would, in many households, 
effect a marvellous transformation. A good cook 
does not entirely depend on book and rule ; a cer- 
tain natural aptitude is necessary, though knowledge 
acquired from teachers and books on cookery is most 
m valuable. 

It would be useless to expect to educate every woman 
to be a skilful cook ; nor is it necessary that all women 
should be first-rate cooks ; but every woman should 
and could, if disposed, be able to prepare the plainer 
articles of food so that they are palatable, nutritious, 
and digestible. Whether the trouble to get this know- 



70 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

ledge be great or small, it ouglit to be faced. No intelli- 
gent and competent housekeeper, whether mistress or 
servant, should, however, be contented by merely acquir- 
ing the rudiments of cooking ; she should be able to 
compound cheap and palatable dishes, the recipes for 
which she had herself put together. 

Anythmg which is a person's duty to do should be done 
well, and by doing so one ought to find pleasure and pride 
in it. Cooking being such an important part of the daily 
work of millions of mistresses and servants, it is one of 
those things in which they should excel. They should 
not begrudge the time and study required to enable 
them to become skilful and economical cooks. 

It is no trifling matter to serve day after day half- 
boiled potatoes and badly cooked vegetables, unpalatable 
stews, and underdone meat ; the human stomach not 
only fails to get its proper nourishment as it should 
from these viands, but it experiences also inconvenience, 
contracts disease, and suffers the consequent penalty. 
What can be more unpalatable than food served up 
before it is properly cooked, and what less satisfying to 
the appetite ? Any food which the stomach loathes, 
whether from toughness, richness, bad flavour, or un- 
palatableness, is not a pleasure, and cannot possibly 
be wholesome or economical, and must consequently 
be injurious to human health. Wise people can 
check gluttony, if good cookery should encourage 
over-eating ; but this I should hardly think would be 
the case. 



HIGH-CLASS AND DOMESTIC COOKEKY 71 

If meat is hard, tough, and unpalatable, it is plain 
that some rule of good cooking has been neglected, and 
the result is not that it is merely uninviting, but that 
it is, as before said, unwholesome. Custards turn, cakes 
do not rise, pastry is heav}" and uneatable, soups and 
fish, &c., go wi'ong simply for the want of science on 
the part of the cook. A gifted cook can flavour better 
"to taste " than by following any scientific mode of 
due proportions of seasoning ; but a gifted cook is a 
rare person, and ordinary mortals must be con- 
tented to follow the definite rules which are set before 
them. 

On the whole, it cannot be doubted that cooking as 
an art has much progressed of late years, and will be 
more perfected if still more intelligent knowledge is 
directed to it. 



Notes on Boilingf. 

Well-boiled meat is not so common as it should be, 
and one of the reasons is the persistence with which 
the old-fashioned notion of putting the joint into cold 
water is still clung to by many writers on this subject. 



72 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

Mrs. Glasse is often referred to as the most old- 
fashioned and unscientific of cooks, but she, at any 
rate, steered clear of this blunder ; whereas, Murray 
says : ** All meat for boiling should be first entirely 
covered with cold water." One of the best authorities 
says : "If the flesh be introduced into the boiler when 
the water is in a state of brisk ebullition, and if the 
boiling be kept up for a few minutes, and the pot 
then placed in a warm place, so that the temperature 
of the water is kept at 158 deg. to 165 deg., we have 
the united conditions for giving to the flesh the 
qualities which fit it for being eaten. If you wish 
to rob meat of its most nourishing and wholesome 
properties, put it in cold water, which receives them, 
leaving the meat quite unfit for eating, even if it does 
make the water a foundation for soup —that is, stock ! 
But if you want ' stock,' it can be made with 
cheaper material than joints of meat intended for the 
table." 

When meat is to be eaten, the albumen should be 
retained in it, for not only does it preserve the fibrin 
from becoming hard, but it gives to it softness and 
delicacy. The influence of boiling water upon albumen 
is well known. The best method of boiling meat 
intended for food is to introduce it into boiling water ; 
if the boiling be kept up for five minutes, and then so 
much cold water be added as to reduce the temperature 
to 165 deg., and the whole retained at this temperature 
long enough, all the conditions are united which give 
to the flesh the quahty best adapted for its use as 



NOTES ON BOILING 73 

food. When it is introduced into the boiling water, 
the albumen immediately coagulates from the surface 
inwards, and in this state forms a crust, which no 
longer permits the external water to penetrate into 
the interior of the mass of flesh. But the temperature 
is gradually transmitted to the interior, and there 
effects the conversion of the raw flesh into the 
state of boiled. The flesh retains its juiciness, and 
is quite as agreeable to the taste as it can be made 
by roasting. When the temperature of the interior 
of a piece of meat has not reached 144 deg. it presents 
a blood-coloured or underdone appearance. The 
principle of both boiling and roasting is the same — 
to endeavour as quickly as possible to surround the 
joint with a hard film of meat, in order to keep 
the flavour in, not to dissolve it out with a cold-water 
bath. Cold water extracts from the meat two most 
important elements of the gastric juice — lactic and 
phosphoric acids. 

In boiling meat, however, a certain proportion of the 
nutritious qualities are sure to escape into the water and 
steam, for which reason the quantity of water should 
not be more than suffices to cover the meat, nor the 
saucepan an inch larger than it must needs be to hold it. 
Boiled too long or too fast, meat becomes indigestible 
and hard. Hard water is better than soft water for 
boiling meat in, more of its tenderness and richness 
being retained in the former than in the latter. Too 
rapid boiling tends to overdo the exterior portion of the 
meat, while the interior remains underdone. For this 



74 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

reason after the meat has been in water kept at the 
boiling-point about five minutes the temperature should 
be reduced, and the rest of the process be more 
slowly conducted. Salted meat, in particular, should 
be very slowly cooked, kept simmering and allowed to 
grow cool in the pot. The scum which rises to the 
surface of the water should be carefully removed 
while the water is near the boiling-point, as other- 
wise it sinks, and looks very unsightly attached to the 
meat. 



Notes on Roasting. 



Roasting is a process which, if well done, requires 
great care, attention, and thoughtfulness on the part of 
the cook, the method being a difficult and important one, 
and by no means a thing of rule which can be mechani- 
cally performed. In the first place, the fire must be in 
the right condition — clear, bright and giving out uniform 
but not too strong heat — and its breadth and depth 
should be regulated to the size of the joint. The weight 
of the joint to be roasted, the condition and form of the 
meat, and its proportions of fat and lean should also be 
considered. Meat of newly killed beasts requires longer 
cooking. In warm weather joints require slightly less 



NOTES ON ROASTING * 75 

roasting than in cold. Thick joints — say sirloins of beef 
or legs of mutton — will not be well cooked if roasted as 
long as you would roast thinner ones, such as ribs of 
beef or shoulders. Boned or stuffed meat will require 
longer cooking than the same joints would unstuffed, or 
with the bone in. The meat of young animals and of 
older ones requires different treatment (as a rule, young 
flesh, containing less fibrin requires most cooking) ; 
some kinds of meat are best roasted before a brisk fire 
(pork, veal, and lamb, for instance) ; others should be 
more slowly cooked. [Some flesh requires very little 
cooking, some much longer — the flesh of old and full- 
grown animals, poultry excepted, requiring the shorter 
time.] The cook's aim should be to preserve the reai 
flavour and nourishing qualities of the meat, and to 
prevent the juices from being dried out during the roast- 
ing process. Attaining this aim depends chiefly upon 
the roasting being neither too quick nor too slow, and 
upon the care given to the basting, which should always 
be thoroughly done. Avoid thrusting forks into roasting 
meat. It is a good plan to begin with the meat rather 
close to the fire and then a little farther from the fire, 
increasing the distance between the grate and the joint 
until (the exterior being hardened) the flesh is heated 
nearly uniformly all through, and then bringing it and 
keeping it near the fire, lest remaining too far from it 
should destroy its crisp firmness, and make it un- 
pleasantly soft and soddened. If too little cooked or 
underdone, meat is indigestible. If too much cooked or 



76 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

dried up, it is not less so. Overcooking expels the fluids 
and contracts the fibres. It is sometimes absurdly 
urged that underdone indigestible meat is to be preferred 
because it is in itself more nutritious than the digestible 
or better-cooked flesh. But this is not dealing with 
flesh as food ; for if it were, cooking would be altogether 
dispensed with, because raw meat contains more of the 
nutritious elements than underdone meat. It is the 
cook's business not only to send food to table as full of 
nourishing qualities as it can be, but to see that such 
qualities are in a fit condition to do their beneficent 
work of repairing and restoring most effectually. 



Notes on Stewing. 



The stewpan is one of the most efficient utensils 
in the hands of a good cook. Stewing has this advan- 
tage over boiling, the more nourishing and soluble 
elements are not separted from, but served up with, the 
meat, the full flavour of which is also thereby preserved. 
It is sometimes described as a gradual process of sim- 
mering. The meat selected for stewing should be lean, 
and, as a rule, the better the meat, the better it will be for 



NOTES ON STEWING 77 

eating ; but it must be remembered that by stewing, the 
coarser and cheaper parts of meat, such as bones, cheeks, 
feet, tails, shanks, knuckles, trimmings, &c., may be 
rendered highly palatable and nutritious. Every pound 
of meat stewed will require about a quart of water (if it 
is found too little, warm water can be afterwards added). 
The heating should be slow and gradual, the skum taken 
off as it rises, and the stewing continued until the flavour 
of the meat is entirely extracted. For stewing, the 
closed range or stove is preferable to the open grate, 
and if the latter is in use contact between the stewpan 
and the fire should be prevented. 



Notes on Frying. 

Frying is a process frequently condemned by scien- 
tific authorities mainly, perhaps, because it is in high 
favour with bad cooks. Contrast for one moment the 
discoloured dish, too often met with in private houses, 
in which, say, a little bit of fish is sent up, and presents 
what may be called a parti-coloured appearance. Some 
part is burned black as a cinder, another part looks the 
colour of underdone pie-crust, and again other parts 
present bald patches, as if the cook had accidentally 



78 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

spilled some boiling w?*;ter on ?. cat's back. Contrast 
this with the beautifully rich golden-coloured dish that 
will make its appearance at the table where the master 
mind of one like Francatelli has presided, or with a dish 
that one would meet with in a Parisian cafe, the bright 
silver dish contrasting temptingly with the gold-coloured 
food and the crisp dark green parsley piled in the centre 
— a work of art which pleases both eye and palate, 
senses nigher akin in their respective offices than thought- 
less cooks can imagine them to be. The condition of 
the fire is of importance ; you cannot fry properly over 
a bad one ; continous care is another necessary condition. 
Successful frying, in short, demands both skill and 
knowledge, and in proportion to their exercise and degree 
will be the reputation of both frying and the fried. 
" The art of frying," says Sir Henry Thompson, " is 
little understood, and the omelet is ahnost entirely 
neglected by our countrymen. The products of our 
frying-pan are often greasy, and therefore for many 
persons indigestible, the shallow form of the pan being 
unsuited for the process of boiling in oil, that is, at the 
heat of nearly 500 deg. Fahr. (that of boiling water 
being 212 deg.). This high temperature produces results 
which are equivalent indeed to quick roasting (when the 
article is cooked in boiling fat) ; but frying as generally 
conducted is rather a combination of boiling and toast- 
ing (or scorching) ; and the use of the deep pan of 
boiling oil or dripping which is essential to the right 
performance of the process, and especially as preventing 



NOTES ON FRYING 79 

greasiness, is a rare exception and not the rule in ordi- 
nary kitchens. The principle on which success depends 
is that at the moment of contact with the almost boiling 
fat a thin film over every part of the surface of the fish 
or other obj ect to be fried is coagulated, so that the 
juices with their flavours &c. are at once locked up 
within, and no quality can escape. The frying fat should, 
therefore, be in sufficient quantity, and also hot enough, 
to efiect this result in an instant, after which, and dur- 
ing the few minutes required to cook the interior, the 
heat may be slightly lowered with advantage." 



Notes on Braising. 

Braising is a kind of improved stewing process, 
which the before -mentioned authority thinks we very 
unwisely neglect. " In braising," he says, "the meat is 
just covered with a strong liquor of vegetable and 
animal juices (braise or mirepoix) in a closely 
covered vessel, from which as little evaporation as 
possible is permitted, and is exposed for a considerable 
time to a surrounding heat just short of boiling." By 
this treatment tough, fibrous flesh, whether of poultry 



80 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

or of cattle, or meat unduly fresh, such as can alone be 
procured during the summer season in towns, is made 
tender, and is furthermore impregnated with the odours 
and flavour of fresh vegetables and sweet herbs, while 
the liquor itself, slowly reduced in the process, furnishes 
the most appropriate, fragrant, and delicious sauce with 
which to surround the portion when served at table. 
Thus, also, meats which are dry and of little flavour, 
such as veal, become saturated with juices, which render 
the food succulent and delicious. Spices and wine are 
sometimes used to impart their flavours. The process 
of cooking a braise is thus spoken of by Jules Gouffe in 
his "Livre de Cuisine." The chief operation is one of 
slow simmering, for, he says, if the meat be exposed to 
sudden heat the gravy is insipid, colourless, and weak, 
as it too often is in such preparations by careless or 
ignorant cooks. The gravy should be highly nutritious, 
of a rich high colour and flavour, and of gelatinous con- 
sistency. "I advise," he says, "that for braising the 
quantity of meat should be large rather than small, as a 
long process of cooking s most effective, and you at 
once obtain two admirable dishes instead of one, for 
when the braise is cold it is equally good, and affords a 
pleasant change." 



81 



Notes on Broiling and Grilling. 



This is a process in general favour with both cooks 
and physicians, as it retains in the meat the more 
nutritious qualities and flavour, their evaporation and 
exhalation being prevented by the sudden closing to- 
gether of the fibres, or, in other words, the hardening 
and bro^vning of the surface. The gridiron, kept always 
in a perfectly clean condition, should be made hot and 
previously rubbed with a piece of clean fat to prevent 
scorching, and thereby disfiguring the appearance of the 
food ; and the fire, where coal or coke is used, should be 
clear and bright. The great art lies in suiting the time of 
cooking and the number of turns to the size, thickness, 
and general character of the meat you have to broil — 
a beefsteak, for instance, requiring more frequent turning 
than a mutton chop, and a pork chop requiring a longer 
time for its broiling than a steak. Special care must be 
exercised to keep the fat from falling into the fire, as the 
sudden blaze conveys a smoky flavour to the meat. But, 
above everything, take care not to pinch the meat in 
turning, or the juices will run out, and much of the 
flavour be lost. At the first cut from a well- cooked 
steak or chop, especially a steak, the gravy should 
burst forth. The value of the gridiron is, perhaps 
nowhere better known than in England, especially in 



82 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

relation to chops, steaks, kidneys, the blade-bone, or 
even a small shoulder of mutton, all of which may be 
sent to table in the highest perfection from a clear fire 
managed by careful and competent hands ; although 
it is still not so widely appreciated as it deserves to be in 
the preparation of many a small dish of fish, fowl, and 
meat or bone, to say nothing of a grilled mushroom^ 
either alone or as an accompaniment to any of them. 



Notes on Salads and Salad Dressing. 

Salads are now, as they ^v^ere a couple of hundred 
years ago, composed of certain pot-herbs, to which are 
added various aromatic odoriferous herbs or fournituresy 
as the French call them, which greatly add to the zest 
of the mixture. There are about twelve of these herhes 
de fourniture, namely, garden-cress, watercress, chervil, 
chives, scalhons or green onions, tarragon, pimpernel or 
burnet, parsley, hartshorn, sweet basil, purslane, fennel, 
and young balsam. Cresses are wholesome and anti- 
scorbutic, chervil is a purifier, chives a stimulant, tar- 
ragon stomachic and corroborant, while parsley is 
carminative, and the remaining herbs are all pronounced 
by Lemery in his " Traite des Aliments" to have 
medicinal virtues. 



NOTES ON SALADS AND SALAD DRESSING 8B 

Salads, of course, vary with the season. Chicory or 
endive is in season at the end of autumn, and it is not 
usual to add any herhe de fourniture to that salad. 
Some in France place at the bottom of the salad-basin 
containing an endive salad a small crust of stale bread 
rubbed over with garlic, which gives a slight flavour 
to the dish. Later in the season another species of 
chicory called scarole is had recourse to. It is not so 
tender as chicory proper, but has as much flavour, and 
is quite as wholesome. Chicory, according to Lemaire, 
is of a cooling nature, and creates an appetite. Winter 
salads are generally composed of mdche or corn salad, 
rampions and chopped celery. Sometimes also in 
winter a salad is made exclusively of chopped celery,, 
seasoned with oil and mustard. 

Garden or water-cress is also a winter salad. It is 
good to mix it with slices of beetroot ; and in France, 
more especially in Provence, ohves are often added. 
Towards February the salad most in vogue is an 
endive called barbe de Ca^ucin, or Capucin's beard. It 
is seasoned like the white succory. 

The lettuce generally appears about the commence- 
ment of Lent, but the better sort of lettuce does not 
make its appearance before Easter. It is the most 
popular of all salads. Herbes de fourniture are added 
to it, in which anchovies and chopped chives are mixed.. 
Sometimes, as a variety, prawns and shrimps are 
added. 

Next comes the Roman lettuce, less watery, and 



84 PEACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

with much fuller and finer flavour than the preceding, 
especially when the leaves are streaked. The Roman 
lettuce is sometimes served with odoriferous herbs, 
hard eggs are often added to the seasoning. The 
Roman lettuce is in season from May to the end of 
autumn. 

Besides these there are hotch-potch salads made 
en ynacedoine in a variety of roots and vegetables, 
such as French beans, haricots blancs, lentils, small 
onions, beetroot, saxifrage, or goat's beard, potatoes, 
carrots, artichoke bottoms, asparagus tops, gherkins, 
sliced anchovies, soused tunny, olives, &c. 

There are salads also of meat, fish, and game. A 
salade a Vitalienne is composed of cold fowl cut up 
in pieces and served with anchovies and dressed 
salad. True connoisseurs of the vegetable luxury wipe 
the separated leaves of the lettuce one by one with 
care. They break the foliage for the salad-bowl, never 
cutting it, and debate and commingle the component 
parts of the dressing with anxiety and scrupulous care. 
A good salad can be concocted, of course, out of fifty 
ingredients, from nettle-tops and dandelion leaves 
through cold potato and beetroot to the lettuce and 
the endive, which are salad plants par excellence. It 
is in dressing, however, that genius is most exhibited. 
The broad rule has been well laid down in the familiar 
formula, that to compound a proper garnish for a bowl 
of salad demands " a sage for the salt, a miser for the 
vinegar, a prodigal for the oil, and a maniac for the 
Other and difficult problems must of course 



NOTES ON SALADS AND SALAD DRESSING 85 

arise ; but, from whatever side we examine the question of 
this seasonable dish, everything depends upon oil — good, 
pure, pellucid, nut-flavoured oil. That of the olive is 
to be preferred, of course, and for choice the Provence 
oil, as distinguished from the so-called *' Lucca." Home- 
made salad dressing, it goes without saying, is better 
than that bought ready-made. A few not generally 
known items on the subject may be acceptable. First, 
you can boil your dressing, and so keep it, tightly 
bottled, for some time. Take three eggs, one tablespoon- 
ful each of sugar, oil, and salt, a small tablespoonful of 
mustard, a cupful of milk, and one, or less, of vinegar. 
Stir the oil, salt, mustard, and sugar in a bowl until 
perfectly smooth, add the yolk of the eggs, well beaten, 
then the vinegar, and lastly the milk. Place the bowl 
in a basin of boiling water, and stir the contents till of 
the consistency of custard. For aspic mayonnaise 
dressing melt a cupful of savoury jelly, then put it in a 
bowl, which place in a basin of ice water, mix with a 
quarter cup of vinegar, one tablespoonful of sugar, one 
scant of mustard, one teaspoonful of salt, and a pinch 
of cayenne. Beat the jelly with a whisk, and when it 
thickens add the oil and vinegar little by little, lastly a 
little lemon -juice, beating it all the time. This dressing 
ought to be very white, and will serve as an excellent 
salad dressing. 




We may live without poetry, music, and art ; 

We may live without conscience, and live without heart ; 

We may live without friends ; we may live without books ; 

But civilised man cannot live without cooks. 

We may live without books — what is knowledge but grieving : 

We may live without hope — what is hope but deceiving ? 

We may live without love — what is passion but pining 

But where is the man that can live without dining ?

Etiquette for serving Hors-d'oeuvre, &c. 

There are a number of Hors-d'oeuvre, as well as 
other eatables, that may be taken at the dinner table 
without the aid of either knife, fork, or spoon — for 
instance : 

Olives, to which a fork should never be applied. 

Sandiviches. They should never be cut too large. 

Asparagus, whether hot or cold. 

Lettuce, which should be dipped in the dressing or 
a little salt. 

Celery, which may be placed on the table beside the 
plate. 

Bread, Toast, Tarts, Small Cakes, <&c. 

Fruits of all kinds except preserves, which are 
eaten with a spoon ; melons and pines are eaten with 
fruit knives, and often apples and pears. 

Cheese is in some cases eaten with the fingers, even 
by the most particular gourmets. 

Either the leg or other sriiall pieces of a bird may be 
picked with the fingers.

CHAPTER I. 
ELEMENTAEY METHODS AND EULES. 



1, Flavouring and t^easoning. 

The most important articles used are salt, pepper, 
spices, vinegar, oil, fat, butter, mustard, aromatic herbs, 
&c. 

The principal functions of these food adjuncts is to 
render food more palatable, more appetising, and more 
digestible. 

Salt is the chief and most important seasoning used ; 
it is not merely a seasoning, but a necessary of life, for 
it removes the insipid flavour from all eatables, such as 
meat, vegetables, &c.; it acts as an appetiser 'and pro- 
motes digestion. The average quantity of salt required 
by each person being, according to medical authority, 
from ^ to ^ an ounce per day, it becomes a necessary 
adjunct for the preservation of health. AYhen added to 
food it supplies the material for two important agents 
in the processes of digestion and nutrition, viz., the 
gastric juice and the constituents of the bile. Salt, 
like all seasonmgs, must be used with judgment, for if 
used in excess it is apt to spoil the dishes, and often 
renders them uneatable. 

When added to boiling water, it raises its tempera- 
ture and liberates the oxygen. 

Salt acts further as a great preserving agent for. 
meat, vegetables and other substances. 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 355 

Spices, such as white and black pepper, cayenne,, 
cloves, nutmeg, paprika (Hungarian pepper), coriander, 
cinnamon, mace, &c., cannot be considered to have any 
nutritive properties ; they are used for the purpose of 
imparting certain flavours to improve the taste of various- 
food substances. In adding the seasoning and flavour- 
ing to dishes, it is of the greatest importance for a 
cook to remember that the exquisite sensibility of a 
cook's palate can best be judged and admired by his or- 
her cooking. 

Aromatic Spice is a mixture of various flavours^ 
consisting of pepper, salt, cinnamon, mace, powdered 
bayleaf, thyme, marjoram, nutmeg, and cayenne ; these 
are used principally for braised meats, sautes, ragouts, 
galantines, vol-au-vents, game pies, and numerous other 
preparations. All spices, if used judiciously, undoubt- 
edly render a very nice and agreeable flavour. 

An absurd idea prevails that "plain cooking" 
requires no other seasoning beyond pepper and salt, and 
perhaps some Worcester sauce or ketchup. There are 
a number of other inexpensive condiments, besides these, 
which could with advantage be used for the plainest of 
cooking, and, with the needful amount of judgment and 
reserve, all dishes can be so seasoned and flavoured,, 
which would improve the monotony of " plain dishes " 
at a very small cost. 

Entrees and savoury dishes are as a rule rather 
highly seasoned ; this should, however, be done with 
moderation and in accordance with the dish. 

Aromatic Herbs and Plants. — The following are 
the names of herbs and plants mostly used in the 
kitchen : Parsley, bayleaves, thyme, marjoram, sage, 
tarragon, chervil, chives, onions, shallots, garlic, &c. 
A number of these are used in a dry state, but either dry 
or fresh they are used in a large variety of preparations. 

When onions, shallots, or garlic are used they 
should always be well blended with other flavours, so 
that the peculiar and often objectionable taste of these 
cannot be detected.

356 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

2, A Pinch of Salt or Pepper, 

This expression is much used in cookery ; it is there- 
fore necessary, in order to convey a notion of the accurate 
quantities of a pinch, to state that a pinch of salt or 
pepper should be ^ of an ounce, and a small pinch 
(mostly applied to cayenne) y^ o^ ^^^ ounce in weight. It 
would, however, be difficult and impracticable to make 
use of the scales every time a pinch of salt or pepper is 
required. The best plan is to ascertain the capacity of 
one's fingers by weighing the quantity they hold, and 
then getting accustomed as to the exact quantity required 
for seasoning. 

In the matter of spices, as well as of herbs and soup 
vegetables, it is best, to avoid continually referring to the 
scales, to accustom one's self as much as possible to 
be able to tell by sight the weight of the needful quantity 
of ingredients required. 

S, Bouquet garni. 

Procure a few branches of parsley, one or two sprigs 
of thyme, 1 bayleaf, a spig of marjoram, a sprig of basil, 
a little chives, green celery leaves, and a clove of garlic if 
hked. 

Wash and dry the parsley, chives and celer}^ cut the 
latter in pieces about the size of the parsley, put all 
nicely together in a bunch, and tie up with a piece of 
string. Other aromatic herbs may be included in the 
bunch if liked. Excessive use of strong smelhng herbs 
must, however, be avoided. 

4. Fried Parsley (Persil frit). 

Fried parsley is mostly used to garnish fried dishes. 
Remove the leaves from some fresh curly parsley, wash 
well in cold water, drain, fold in a cloth and press gently 
to extract all the water ; then put in a wire frying 
basket, have some fat quite hot, fry the parsley for about 
2 minutes (long enough to stiffen), then drain on a cloth 
and use as required. 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 357 

5. Chopped Parsley (Persil hache). 

Wash some parsley, trim off some of the stalks if 
coarse, chop as finely as possible, place it in the corner 
of a clean cloth, fold the end of the cloth, and hold 
tightly under the water tap or rinse in a basin of cold 
water, squeeze out all the water and put on a plate till 
wanted. 

6. To Chop an Onion, 

Peel the onion, cut it in two lengthways, leaving 
the stalk ends. Commence to slice each half without 
detaching the slices from the stalk. Keep firmly 
together, and cut through several times crossways ; then 
cut down horizontally into fine squares, until you come 
to the stalk. This is the quickest way to mince an 
onion, but it requires practice. The other way is to 
peel and chop in the ordinary manner. When fine 
enough, wash in cold water, drain on a cloth, and use 
as required. 

7. To Chop Mushrooms, 

If freshly-gathered mushrooms are used, peel off the 
skins, trim the stalks, and wash in cold water ; then 
chop as required, and use immediately. 

Preserved mushrooms are well drained, and then 
chopped as required. 

8, LiaisoUf in general. 

There are a number of processes of thickening soups 
and sauces, and these are called " liaisons," in a culinary 
sense. 

A liaison may be composed of flour (fegule, arrow- 
root, cornflour, creme-de-riz, &c.), diluted in either 
milk, cream, stock, or water, according to the nature of 
the soup or sauce for which it is required. A liaison 
should always be strained before it is mixed with the 
liquid which requires thickening, and the preparation 
be well stirred whilst the latter is added.

ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 359 

The liaison of egg is very frequently used for white 
purees, blanquettes, fricassees, and white sauces. 

Only the yolks of egg should be used, mixed with a 
small quantity of cream, and well beaten. 

Such liaison should only be added to the preparation 
for which it is required when it is thoroughly cooked ; 
part of the soup or sauce is poured on to the liaison, 
stirred, and then all mixed well together. 

When once the liaison of egg is added, the prepara- 
tion must on no account be allowed to boil, but only 
just get thoroughly heated, so as to form the liaison, 
thus preventing the eggs from curdling. 

9, Panade, for Forcemeat, &c» 

Put half a pint of water and an ounce of butter into 
a stewpan, add a pinch of salt, stir in gradually when 
boiling four ounces of sifted flour ; work vigorously with 
a wooden spoon or spatula over the fire for a few minutes. 
The panade is done when it leaves the sides and bottom 
of the stewpan perfectly clean. Spread it on a dish or 
plate, and use when cold. Another way is to soak in 
tepid water or milk some white bread (without crust) 
for an hour, put it in a cloth to squeeze out the moisture, 
turn into a stewpan with an ounce of butter to six 
ounces of bread ; heat up over a slow fire, stirring all 
the while, add a pinch of salt, turn on to a plate, and 
use when cool. 

10. Houx. 

Roux is the French term for a preparation used as 
a thickening for gravies, sauces, or soups. It consists 
of flour fried in butter to a desired colour or blend. 
There are three kinds — the white, the blonde or fawn, 
and the brown. The white roux is made with, say, five 
ounces of butter and four ounces of flour. Melt the 
butter, sift the flour and stir into the butter. Cook 
slowly on the side of the stove for about ten minutes, 
without allowing it to take colour. Blonde roux is made 
in the same way, but is stirred over a slow fire until i* 



360 EECHEECHE COOKERY. 

becomes of a fawn or blonde colour. White and blonde 
roux are used for veloute and Allemande sauces, the 
former for Bechamel and other white sauces. 

For a brown roux, leave it on the fire or put in a 
moderately heated oven until it attains a Hght brown 
or chestnut colour. 

Roux should at all times be allowed to cool a few 
minutes before the moistening is added. It need not 
be used immediately, for it will keep some time if put 
in a covered jar and kept in a dry place. 

The proportion of moisture used is one quart of liquid 
to four ounces of flour. 

11, A Mirepoix, 

A mirepoix is the foundation for flavouring sauces, 
braised meats, and a number of thick soups. Its com- 
position consists of the following ingredients, which 
must be varied according to the quantity required : — 

2 carrots weighing about 5 oz. each. 
2 onions weighing about 4 oz. each. 

1 oz. of parsley or parsley root. 

2 bay leaves. 

1 blade of mace. 
1 or 2 shallots. 

1 sprig of thyme. 
12 peppercorns. 

2 cloves. 

^ lb. of raw fat ham or fat bacon. 
i lb. beef or veal trimmings. 

(The latter may be left out.) 
^ oz. mignonette pepper. 

Method. — Prepare the vegetables, cut the bacon, 
&c., into small pieces ; fry in a stewpan a Hght brown 
colour. Add the vegetables cut in slices ; stir over the 
fire until light brown, then add the herbs, &c. 

If required for sauce or brown purees, add the need- 
ful quantity of roux, and moisten with about two quarts 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 361 

of stock and half a pint of white wine. Stir and cook 
gently for one hour or longer. 

12, Salpicon, 

A salpicon is a mince of either chicken, game, 
foie-gras, or veal with tongue, ham, mushrooms and 
truffles. 

The whole is cut into small dice and put into some 
prepared sauce — Allemande, Bechamel, or brown sauce. 
The quantity required depends upon the dish it is to be 
used in. If for croquettes, only a small quantity is 
used for binding the mixture. 

Salpicon is mostly used for filling bouchees (small 
puff-paste patties), when it is heated up in the sauce. 

Oysters and lobsters, shrimps, and fillets of sole are 
frequently used for bouchees, in which case the filling 
is thus prepared, and is known under the general name 
of Salpicon, ham or tongue being of course omitted. 

IS. Hints oil Cooking Meats. 

Cutting^. — When cuttting meat for cooking, always 
cut across the grain of the muscle. 

Cleaning^. — Meat for roasting or braising should 
never be washed. Wipe it with a damp cloth, or scrape 
it, if it requires cleaning or drying. 

Seasoning. — As a general rule, meat should be 
seasoned with salt, &c., just before it is taken up. 

Keeping on Ice. — Never place meat directly on the 
ice ; put it on a dish or plate on the ice. 

Boiling. — The art of boiling meat is to put it on in 
boiling water, with enough water to well cover it. Boil 
up quickly (this keeps in the juice and flavour). Salt 
meat should be put on in warm water, not boiling, as 
this helps to extract some of the salt. When the meat 
boils draw on to the side of the stove, and let boil 
slowly, or simmer until done. 

Time for Boiling.— Fifteen to twenty minutes should 
be allowed to each pound of fresh meat, according to 



362 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

the kind and size of meat. The time is reckoned from 
the moment it begins to boil, and not when put into 
the pan. Salt meat requires longer to boil than fresh 
meat. 

14, JBraiser (to braise). 

Brazing or braising is a combination of steT\dng and 
baking. Meat which is braised is as a rule boned, and 
is put in a copper stewpan or braising-pan (braisoire), 
usually on a "mirepoix " — that is, a bed of vegetables, 
such as carrot, turnip, onion, faggotof herbs, &c., bacon, 
and broth or stock. 

The word braiser means to simmer gently, the stew- 
pan being set upon embers on the stove or in the oven. 
The former is the correct method. The heat required 
for braising is radiant heat, therefore the pan should 
have a tightly fitting lid, which is so constructed as to 
hold burning embers which ought to generate the heat 
upon the surface of the stew, whereby the meat is 
cooked in a kind of miniature oven. The bottom heat 
should be slower than that of the top. This mode of 
cooking is a very favourite one in France and throughout 
the Continent. In many cases it is undoubtedly an 
improvement upon boiling or roasting. 

15, Sauter, 

This word frequently appears in recipes, but the 
idea as to what is really meant by it is not properly 
understood in English kitchens. The correct English 
word for '' sauter " is toss, and it means to fry quickly 
and lightly with a small quantity of butter or oil, just 
sufficient to keep what is in the pan from burning whilst 
it is being cooked. Sauter should therefore not be con- 
fused with either roasting or frying. 

To saute meat or vegetables is to cook rapidly on a 
quick fire. Chicken fillets, finely-shredded liver, small 
beef or veal fillets, potatoes, beans, &c., are sauteed in 
either butter or oil. 

Tossing backwards and forwards or frequent turning 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 363 

until the articles are of the desired colour is what may 
be truly termed saute. 

16, To Wann tip Cold Meat. 

In re-heating meats for hash, mince, &c., it is very 
necessary that it should simmer in the sauce or gravy 
for at least three-quarters of an hour. The slices should 
not be cut too thin. 

In simmering the meat it will be found that during 
the first twenty minutes the fibre becomes somewhat 
horny and tough, and it will require at least another 
twenty-five minutes longer to soften the meat and to 
acquire a more palatable flavour. It is quite a mistake 
to warm up meat in a hurry, for by so doing you will 
only render it tough and tasteless. 

Kedressing viands which have appeared previously 
on the table is an art in itself, and the art lies in the 
knowledge to make such dishes tempting in appearance, 
agreeable to the palate, tender and tasty. 

1 7. To Truss Poultry for Hoasting, 

Turkey. — Break the legs near the toes, fasten on to 
a hook, and pull off so as to draw the sinews from the 
legs. Put the bu'd on to a board, breast downwards, 
head toward you. Take hold of the head with your 
left hand, and cut a slit in the back of the neck with 
your right hand ; then loosen the skin round the neck, 
cut ofi' the neck close to the body, also the skin, leaving 
it about 2 inches long, so as to fold it over the back. 
Remove the crop carefully ; put the forefinger in the 
throat end, and loosen the inside round the carcase. 
Make an incision at the vent just large enough to put 
in your fingers, loosen the inside, taking care not to 
break the gall-bag, then draw out the whole of the in- 
side. Break the breast bone if necessary, and flatten it ; 
turn the bird on its back, press the legs downwards, and 
fasten them with a skewer. Fold over the skin of the 
neck and twist in the wings, fasten with string by 



864 



RECHERCHE COOKERY. 



means of a trussing needle so as to make the bird neat 
in appearance ; tie the knots at the side. Stuffing may 
be inserted at the neck or in the body of the bird before 
being skewered or tied. In place of string a skewer 
can be used to fasten the wings the same as the 
legs. 

Chickens and Pigeons. — Proceed in the same manner 
as a turkey. The sinews need not be pulled out, the 
feet should only have the tips of the toes cut off. Cut 
off the neck close to the body, cut the skin of the neck 
so as to leave sufficient to cover over the back. Fold 
in or twist the wings (pinions) so that the ends are 
brought across the back of the bird, press down the 
legs and fasten with string, which, as for turkeys, should 
be run through the joint of the thighs. 

For Boiling. — Fowls for boiling are treated the same 
as for roasting, with the exception that the legs are cut 
off at the first joint. This done, loosen the skin round 
the legs until it can be pulled over them and the 
latter can be pushed inside the body, after which make 
a slit in the skin sufficiently large to pass the tail of the 
fowl through it. This is done to give it a better 
appearance. 




Capon, Tbussed and Baeded. 



Ducks and Geese are trussed in the same way as a 
turkey, but the first joint of the wings (pinions) are cut 
off. The feet of ducks should only have the tips of the 
toes cut off. Stuffing is inserted either in the neck 
or in the body. In trussing always turn the birds back 
upon the body, keeping the legs firmly to the sides, 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 365 

pull the skin over the tail, slit the skin and pass the tail 
through it the same way as for boiled fowl. 




Boiled Fowl. 

18, To JPich or Pluck Birds, 

Hold the bird you wish to pluck with your left hand 
on your lap, pull off the feathers, commencing at the 
top of the breast. When picked all over, singe (hold it 
over a flame, gas or methylated spirit) to remove 
any small feathers, hairs, or down. 

There is another way of plucking birds, but it 
requires practice, else it is apt to spoil the appearance. 
Plunge the bird into very hot, but not boiling, 
water for about a minute, then commence to pull off 
the feathers. If left too long in the water the skin 
becomes tender and is likely to become detached in 
picking. 




Chicken, Trussed for Roasting. 

19, Boning Poultry or Game, 

To bone poultry or game properly, they must first 
be picked and lightly singed. Next cut or pull off the 



S66 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

legs, a portion of the neck and the pinions, keeping the 
skin of the neck as long as possible. Carefully remove 
the crop. 

Now commence to free the flesh from the carcass, 
beginning at the neck portion. A small sharp knife 
may be used for this purpose. Continue to strip off the 
flesh thus until the carcass is quite detached from the 
flesh. When you arrive at the thighs, dislocate the first 
joints, and remove the bones, separate also the stumps 
from the wings. The nerves which are found in the 
thighs should be pulled out when the legs are cut off. 

Boned poultry or game are generally used for stuffing. 
It is best not to draw the birds until after the flesh is 
removed. The bones, &c., should be used for stock or 
fumet de gibier, for sauces, &c.. No. 236. 

20, Table showing the Average Time required 
for Baking Meat or Birds. 

The exact time required for all joints depends 
necessarily on a variety of circumstances, the kind of 
fire employed, size and thickness of a joint, the time of 
year, &c., by which the cook must be guided, and use his 
or her judgment.

368 RECHEECHE COOKERY. 

The great secret of cooking game perfectly is con- 
stant basting. It should be rather under than over 
done. Just a tint of red in the middle and full of 
gravy. 

21, To Mash, Line or Coat 3Ioul(1s, ttc. 

Put some crushed ice in a basin or shallow tin ; 
wipe the mould or moulds thoroughly dry, then pour in 
almost cold but still liquid aspic or sweet jellies, or 
chaud-froid sauce. Put the mould on the ice and keep 
moving round until the liquid completely covers the 
sides and bottom. When the liquid begins to set pour 
out the remainder, and put the mould back on the ice. 
If a thick layer of coating is required, repeat the same 
operation about 10 or 15 minutes later. 

22. To Unmoald, 

Have a basin of luke-warm water (about 115 to 120 
degrees Fahr.),dip in the mould quickly for a second 
or two ; remove it quickly, hold securely, give it a brisk 
shake, and turn on to a cold dish. Eemove the mould 
as soon as the contents become detached. 

23, Hints on Boiling Vegetables, 

All green vegetables should be put on the fire into 
fast boiling slightly salted water, so that they may be 
brought quickly to the boiling point again. They should 
never be left to steep too long in cold water before 
boiling, as this will tend to toughen them, and in many 
cases destroys colour and flavour. 

Green vegetables, such as greens, cabbage, brocoli, 
savoys, green artichokes, French beans, peas, &c., also 
cauliflowers and asparagus, must be boiled in water con- 
taining a small piece of soda (about the size of a small 
filbert) in addition to the salt. This retains the natural 
colour, extracts some of the strong flavour, and in the 
case of greens &c. the addition of soda is said to make 
these vegetables more digestible. Soda may be sub- 
stituted with brown sugar. 



ELEMENTAEY METHODS AND RULES. 369 

As soon as cooked strain quickly, as to let them 
remain longer in the water than is necessary is ruinous. 
Keep the vegetables hot in a dish over or in hot water 
till required for serving. Over-done or under-done 
vegetables are injurious to health. 

24,, To Blanch Vegetables. 

Vegetables are usually blanched in order to extract 
some of their bitter flavour or to soften them. Parsley, 
tarragon, chervil, onions, shallots, &c., are best blanched 
by plunging them several times into boiling water. 

All green vegetables should be blanched in copper 
stewpans in order to retain their delicate green colour. 

All vegetables &c. required to be blanched are put 
on the fire in cold water, and must be brought quickly 
to the boil, and then be drained and cooled in cold 
water. 

Blanching is the prefix of the method of cooking, 
which is accomphshed in boiling in salted water. 

25, To Blanch Bice^ &c. 

Rice, macaroni, &c., should always be blanched 
before it is put on to finish cooking. Rice should be 
picked and washed in several waters. It is put on the 
fire with plenty of cold water to well cover. It must 
be brought quickly to boil and then put into a sieve to 
drain, allowing cold water to run over so as to cool it. 

26, To Clarify Fat. 

Cut the fat (beef or sheep's kidney suet is best for 
frying purposes) into pieces about half an inch in size ; 
remove any coarse skin &c. which may be on the fat, 
put the pieces in an iron stewpan, add about one gill 
of cold water to every pound of fat, cook over a slow 
fire, stir from time to time to prevent it from burning ; 
when sufiiciently cooked, which will be seen when it 
ceases to froth and the liquid is quite clear, move it to 



370 EECHERCHE COOKERY. 

the corner of the stove to cool a little, then strain 
through a sieve. 

27. Frying in Fat or Oil, 

Successful frying depends upon the fat being^ 
perfectly hot (boiling), the use of clean utensils, a brisk 
p.nd bright fire, and, above all, plenty of clean and good 
fat. Anything that is fried should be served directly 
it is taken from the fire and well strained. Fried dishes 
should never be covered over, for that renders them soft 
or else tough. 

28. To Clarify Butter. 

Put the butter in a stewpan or saute-pan, let it dis- 
solve and cook slowly, then skim off the scum and all 
impurities. The butter is ready for straining as soon as 
a blue smoke appears. Strain through a fine hair-sieve 
or pointed strainer into a basin, let it stand to settle, 
then pour gently into another basin so as to keep out 
the sediment. 

29. Liquid Caramel. 

Put a pound of loaf, castor, or moist sugar into a 
copper stewpan or sugar boiler. Add about half a gill 
of water, and let it dissolve ; stir over a slow fire and 
cook until a dark brown colour ; when a whitish smoke 
appears it is a sign that the sugar is done. Remove it 
from the fire, pour on about a pint of boiling water, 
allow this to boil up whilst stirring, and cook till it has 
the appearance of a syrup ; when cool put it in a corked 
bottle and use as required. 

Caramel should be used with discretion. Good 
cooks rarely use it, for it is apt to impart a bitter taste 
if used too freely. It is principally used for colouring 
clear soups, gravies, and sauces, and sometimes jellies. 

80. Saiunure (Brine) Fickle, for Beef or Fork. 

Two gallons water (soft) ; 6 lbs. coarse salt ; J lb. 
brown sugar ; 1^ oz. saltpetre. 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 371 

Put all the above in a stewpan, let come to the 
boil, skim, and boil for about twenty minutes ; pour 
into a covered pan or tub and use when cold. Meat 
should lay in pickle from eight to ten or more days, 
according to the size. In pickling tongues a separate 
pan should be used ; these usually take from three to 
four weeks to pickle. 

31, Dry JPickling, 

1| lb. salt ; 1 oz. saltpetre ; ^ lb. all-spice ; ^ lb. 
brown sugar. 

First rub in sugar and let meat lie for a few hours, 
then rub in the saltpetre and spice, also the salt, a 
little at the time. Turn and knead meat well, let it lie 
in a cool place from ten to twelve weeks, turning it 
daily. The above quantity is for about 14 lbs. of meat. 

32. Marinade. 

Marinade is the name applied to a kind of preparation 
which is used for pickling fish or meat. It is more 
frequently used for meat than fish. Marinee introduces 
a savoury aroma, and elevates the flavour of meats &c., 
which are usually allowed to lie in pickle from two to 
three days. 

A marinade will keep good for several months if 
boiled up, say, every four days. A small quantity added 
to brown sauce will be found a decided improvement 
where piquancy is required. 

33, Marinade JPicMe, 

One quart vinegar, 3 cloves, 1 onion sliced, 1 carrot, 
\ lemon, \ orange sliced, 12 juniper berries, a few 
coriander seeds, 2 sprigs of thyme and tarragon, 2 
sprigs of marjoram, 1 of sage, 20 peppercorns and 2 
blades mace, \ pint claret, 2 bayleaves. Boil the vinegar 
and claret and pour over the other ingredients. It is 
advisable to season the meat -with a little salt before it 
is put in the marinade.

372 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

S4:, To Wliip Cream. 

Pour the cream into a clean, cool basin ; whip (at 
first gently) until light and frothy. 

When required for sweet dishes, mix lightly a little 
plain castor or vanilla-flavoured sugar. 

When whipped sufficiently, put the cream on to a 
hair sieve, and stand in a cool place or on the ice until 
required. 

Always whip cream or whites of eggs in a cool 
place, or on the ice in warm weather. Use an ordinary 
wire whisk, but make sure it is perfectly clean and dry 
before using it. 

35. To Whisk Whites of Eggs. 

In separating the whites from the yolks of eggs, the 
greatest care must be taken not to let the least portion 
of the yolks get into the whites, otherwise it will be- 
come impossible to whisk the whites firm. 

Put the whites of eggs in an egg bowl or shallow 
basin, first making sure that it is perfectly clean, dry, 
and cool. 

Keep the whites of eggs in a cool place until wanted. 
Add a pinch of salt and commence whisking with an 
ordinary wire whisk, which must be thoroughly clean 
and perfectly dry. Continue to whisk, increasing the 
pace, until it forms a firm and substantial mossy froth. 

36. To Peel Almonds and Pistachios, 

Pour sufficient boiling water over the almonds or 
pistachios to well cover them ; let them soak for several 
minutes, then strain and put in a basin of cold water to 
to cool. Drain and spread them on a cloth. To remove 
the skin press each between the thumb and fingers. 
This done, put them on a sieve to dry. 

To Pound Almonds. — Allow the peeled almonds to dry 
thoroughly in a slack oven for about ten minutes. Clean 
and dry the mortar ; put in the almonds and pound with 
the pestle ; stir well and continually for about ten 
minutes, else they are apt to get oily. When pounded 
put them on a cold dish and use as required. 



ELEMENTARY METHODS AND RULES. 373 

S7» Egging and Crumbing, 

To crumb successfully, use the following proportions 
of egging : 1 egg well beaten, 1 teaspoonful of sweet 
oil, 1 dessert-spoonful of milk, a pinch of salt, and half 
a pinch of pepper (a little chopped parsley is sometimes 
added). Dip the article required to be crumbed in this 
mixture, or brush over well and cover with soft or dry 
bread crumbs. 

Soft or fresh crumbs are made by rubbing the soft 
portion of stale bread through a wire sieve. The crusts 
of bread are placed in a baking sheet in a cool oven, 
and baked to a bright golden colour. They are then 
crushed with a rolling pin or pounded in a mortar 
and passed through a sieve. These are called dry crumbs 
or raspings, and are sometimes used in place of fresh 
crumbs. 

38. Frying Batter (Pate a frire). 

Sift 4 oz. of flour into a basin ; add \ oz. of oiled 
butter, a pinch of salt, 1 yolk of egg, and 1 table- 
spoonful of cream ; mix this well with a wooden spoon, 
and dilute gradually with about half a gill of lukewarm 
water, work it well until the paste becomes quite 
smooth. Allow it to stand for about half an hour or 
more, and when you require to use some whisk two 
whites of eggs to a stifl: froth and mix gently. The 
batter is then ready for use. 

If intended for fruit fritters add a teaspoonful of 
castor sugar ; if for fish or meat a few drops of lemon 
juice added to the batter will be found an improve- 
ment. A thinnish batter is preferable to a thick batter. 

39, Fate a Chouoc (CJioux Faste), for 
general use, 

3 oz. butter, 1^ gill water, 4 oz. flour (sifted), 2 whole 
and 1 yolk of eggs, salt, and a pinch of castor sugar. 

Put the water and butter in a small stewpan, add 
a saltspoonful of salt and a pinch of sugar ; bring it 
to the boil. Stir in the flour, work vigorously over the 
fire with a wooden spoon, continue to work on the 
stove until the paste leaves the sides of the stewpan 



374 BECHERCHE COOKERY. 

clean. Let it cool, and add by degrees the eggs. Use 
as directed. P.S. — ^Yhen choux paste is used for savoury 
or soup quenelles the sugar should be omitted. 

S9a. Meat Glaxe {Glace de Viande), 

Reduce well-skimmed and strained General Stock, 
No. 83, or Eemouillage, No. 84, until it has the appear- 
ance of Espagnole sauce. Stir occasionally to avoid 
burning. It is best to prepare glaze in two boilings, 
that is, to partially reduce it on one day and to finish it 
the next. If found cloudy, add a little cold water ; this 
will clear it. Skim well, and pour in a basin for use. 
To keep glaze, pour over a layer of clarified butter 
before the glaze is quite set. 

To glaze meats, &c., warm up the glaze, dip in a 
brush, and paint over the desired articles.

CHAPTER II. 

HOES D'CEUYEES (COLD). 

41. Beurre (Butter). — Fresh butter is usually 
served at most dinners, as an accompaniment with 
hors d'ceuvres. It is served in little pats, in the shape 
of small shells or little rolls (thm slices rolled). Serve 
in little boats ; in hot weather put a little iced water in 
each boat ; garnish with tiny sprigs of curly parsley. 

42. Radis (Radishes). — Choose small, round, and 
firm radishes of a hght red and white colour. Trim and 
wash them in plenty of water (the outer skins should 
be scraped off and the leaves cut to an inch in length). 
Dish up in little boats, or glass dishes, with a little cold 
water. 

43. Cornichons (Gherkins).— Choose these small, 
firm, and green, and serve in little glass dishes neatly 
dressed, moistened with a little French wine vinegar. 

44. Olives. — Spanish and French olives are the 
best for hors d'ceuvres, the Spanish being the most 
esteemed ; they should remain on the table until the 
dessert is served. Olives destroy the taste of what has 
been previously eaten, hence they are so popular a 
relish. Choose them firm, and of a nice green colour. 
Steep them in cold water before serving; dish up on 
small dishes or boats with a little cold water. Never 
use a metal fork or spoon to dress them. Those left 
over from a meal should be rebottled at once with salted 
water, else they ^vill turn black. 

45. Concombre (Cucumber). — Peel very thin and 
cut up into thin slices, lay the slices on a dish, sprinkle 
with salt, cover, and let them remain thus for one or 



376 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

two hours. Drain well, dish up on small glass dishes, 
season with a little salad oil and French wine vinegar. 
Sprinkle over some chopped parsley, and serve. 

46. Salami, Bologna, Brunswick, Lyons, and other 
Smoked Sausages. — Cut the sausage into very thin 
round slices, remove the skin, dish up neatly, garnish 
with parsley and serve. 

47. Royans a la Bordelaise. — These are procured 
packed in oil, usually in tins. Dish up in glass dishes, 
garnished with some parsley. 

Other fish preparations, such as lax, herrings 
(marine), fillets of herring (sour), &c., are served as 
hors d'ceuvres in the same manner. 

48. Sardines. — Procure an 18-oz. tin, choose a 
well-known brand. Take them carefully out of the tin, 
wipe each slightly with a a cloth, lay them in small 
dishes, moisten with a little sweet oil, garnish with 
capers and sprigs of parsley. Never use the oil out of 
the tin. 

49. Bonnes Bouches de Sardines. — 2| oz. of sardine 
paste, a handful of small cress, 1 dessert-spoonful of 
sweet oil, 1 teaspoonful of vinegar, 8 oz. butter, brown 
bread, salt, pepper, and cayenne ; 2 hard-boiled eggs, 
watercress for garnish. 

Cut some thin slices of brown bread, put 2 oz. of 
sardine paste in a mortar, and pound with the yolks of 
2 hard-boiled eggs, and ih oz. of butter. Eub through 
a fine sieve. Spread this over the slices of bread. Wash 
the cress and cut up small, season with oil, vinegar, 
salt and pepper, and sprinkle over the layer of paste. 
Place another slice of bread on top and press together, 
spread the top of each with butter, and sprinkle over 
thickly with finely-chopped whites of hard-boiled egg. 
Cut them into fanciful shapes, or strips about an inch 
wide, mix some sardine paste with a little cream or 
butter, and ornament the surface by means of a forcing 
bag, according to taste and fancy. Dish them up neatly 
on a folded napkin or dish-paper, and garnish with some 
picked watercress. 



HORs d'ceuvres (cold). 377 

50. Anchois (Anchovies). — AncJiois d Vhuile. — The 
best and most suitable anchovies for hors d'oeuvres 
are the Gorgonas. A very good quaUty also comes from 
Nice. Soak the anchovies in cold water for an hour or 
more, then take out, drain on a cloth, open them and 
take out the bone, trim neatly, dry on a cloth, dish up, 
pour a little sweet oil over them, garnish with parsley 
and serve. 

51. Anchois a la Norvegienne. — Prepare some fillets 
of Norwegian anchovies, trim neatly ; have ready three 
hard-boiled eggs, chop up two coarsely, yoik and 
white separate ; dish up in hors-d'oeuvre dishes (little 
glass dishes) ; season with a little chopped tarragon, 
chervil, and red pepper ; sprinkle with a little oil and 
vinegar. Place the anchovy fillets over the top in the 
shape of lattice work ; ornament with fancy slices of 
lemon, quarters of hard-boiled egg and parsley. 

52. Petites Tranches de Caviar a la Remoulade 
(Small Caviare Slices, Remoulade Style). — Cut twelve 
thin oblong slices of brown bread, pare them into heart 
shapes, about an inch and a half long. Butter the 
slices slightly. Mix two ounces of Russian caviare 
carefully with a squeeze of lemon, a teaspoonful of 
chopped shallots, and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Spread 
the slices rather thickly with the caviare, but do not 
use a knife for this purpose, as steel or metal injures 
the flavour of it. Have ready a teaspoonful of stiff 
mayonnaise, mix gently with one of cold bechamel sauce, 
one hard-boiled egg yolk passed previously through a 
fine wire sieve, chopped parsley, fennel leaves, tarragon 
leaves, and shallots, half a teaspoonful of each, also 
half a teaspoonful of prepared mustard, and one of con- 
centrated tomato puree. Work all vigorously, fill in 
a paper cornet, and ornament the caviare slices to taste. 
Dish up on small round dishes, and stand in a cool place 
until required. 

53. Canapes au Caviar. — Prepare some slices of 
toasted bread, spread them well with butter, stamp out 
some rounds about one and a half inches in diameter, 



378 KECHERCHE COOKERY. 

spread these on one side thickly with Russian caviare, 
place half a stoned Spanish olive in the centre of each, 
put a sprig of parsley or watercress on top of the olives, 
dish up and serve cold. Or if required to be served 
hot, put the rounds of toast with caviare in a hot oven 
for five minutes, then dish up and put the olives on them 
just before sending to table. In either case the dish 
should be garnished with fanciful cut slices of lemon 
and hard-boiled whites of egg. 

54. Caviar aux Ecrevisses. — 2 oz. Russian caviare, 
1 shallot finely chopped, ^ lemon, a pinch of cayenne, 
8 stoned olives, 16 small prawns, 2 large gherkins, 
bread for croutes, clarified butter for frying, parsley. 

Cut some slices of stale bread a quarter of an inch 
thick, stamp out with a plain cutter eight rounds about 
an inch and a half in diameter, fry them in butter a 
light golden colour, drain on paper or cloth and put to 
cool. 

Put the caviare in a basin, add a few drops of lemon 
juice and the chopped shallot, season with cayenne and 
stir gently with a wooden spoon or fork. Cut eight 
thin slices of lemon, place one on each of the bread 
croutes, put about a teaspoonful of caviare on each of 
them, placed a stoned olive in the centre, and arrange 
two picked prawns on each of the croutes. Put a tiny 
sprig of parsley in the centre of each olive. Dish up 
on a warm glass dish in a circle. Shred the gherkins 
and put in the centre. Ornament with a few prawn 
heads and serve. 

55. Canapes a la Capucine. — 4 slices of brown 
bread, 4 oz. hygienic or Astrachan caviare, 8 to 10 
prawns, 1 hard-boiled egg, ^ oz. butter, 1 table- spoonful 
mayonnaise, a few sprigs small cress. 

Stamp out 8 to 10 oval pieces of bread about 2 inches 
long, J of an inch wide. Cream the butter and mayon- 
naise sauce together, spread one side of each slice of 
bread with this, put a layer of cavaire on top. Remove 
the heads from the prawns, free them from skin, split 
open and place one on each. Rub the yolk of hard- 



HORS d'ceuvres (cold). 379 

boiled egg through a sieve, put a Uttle in the centre of 
the canapes, ornamented with httle sprigs of washed 
small cress, dish up on a dish-paper in a pyramidal 
form, place the heads of prawns on the top, and serve. 

66. Tartines de Caviar en Chaud-froid. — Put the 
contents of a small jar of Russian caviare into a 
basin, add a finely-chopped shallot and a teaspoonful of 
lemon-juice, stir gently with a loooden spoon or fork. 
Cut some thin slices of brown bread, butter them, and 
spread one side with the prepared caviare, close up two 
shces and press together tightly. Stamp out some 
rounds with a pastry-cutter an inch and a half in 
diameter. Dissolve an ounce of meat glaze in two table- 
spoonfuls- of rich brown sauce, add a gill of aspic jelly 
and a few drops of caramel, pass through a fine strainer, 
when cooling, mask thickly one side of each sandwich 
with this sauce. Dissolve a gill of aspic jelly and mix 
two tablespoonfuls of double cream, and a few drops of 
lemon-juice, let it cool a little, and mask the other sides 
of the sandwiches. When set run a little half-set aspic 
jelly over the surface of each, and put them on the ice to 
set. Place a round piece of toasted bread in the centre of 
a dish, dress the sandwiches in a circle round the toast, 
alternately one white and one brown ; put a handful 
of dressed salad, such as lettuce, endive, cress, and 
radishes in the centre, put the remainder of the caviare 
neatly on the top, keep on the ice until required for table. 

57. Brissolettes de Caviar. — Procure four or six 
very small farthing rolls, cut them in halves, and trim 
the edge to make them stand firmly, scoop out the 
crumbs and stand in a cool oven to dry. Have ready 
some stiff mayonnaise sauce, add to it enough liquid 
aspic jelly to stiffen the sauce, line the inside of the 
rolls when cold with this, and let set. Put a dessert- 
spoonful of *' Russian caviare" in the centre of each 
roll, place a little chopped aspic jelly on the top of 
each or fill up with a layer of half- set aspic. Ornament 
the surface with small strips of filleted anchovies, dish 
up, garnish with parsley, and serve when quite set. 



380 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

If unable to get the rolls small enough, stamp out 
some rounds of bread, half an inch thick, scoop out some 
of the crumbs, fry in butter, let cool, and proceed as 
above. 

68. Caviar en Salade.— Put two table-spoonfuls of 
best olive oil in a salad bowl, add a table-spoonful of 
vinegar, stir in with a wooden fork or spoon the contents 
of a small pot of " Russian caviare." Slice one hard- 
boiled egg and two ripe tomatoes, mix carefully with 
the above, adding a pinch of cayenne pepper, and a Uttle 
salt if needed. Dish up neatly on little glass dishes, 
sprinkle over a little finely chopped parsley. Ornament 
the dishes with some slices of hard-boiled egg and 
tomato, and serve. 

69. Croutons a I'Espagnole. — Cut eighteen round 
slices of bread about an inch and a half in diameter 
and one-eighth of an inch thick, fry in butter, drain. 
Stone as many large Spanish olives with a sharp tube 
cutter ; fill with some stiff Tartare sauce ; place one in 
the centre of each crouton, curl an anchovy fillet round 
it ; garnish with finely-chopped hard-boiled egg, lobster 
coral, and sprigs of parsley. Dish up on small hors- 
d'oeuvres dishes, and serve. 

60. Then Marine (Tunny Fish). — The tunny is a 
kind of fish which resembles the cod ; it is preserved 
or marinated in oil. The flesh is very firm, has a 
delicate flavour, and looks very much like cooked veal ; 
it makes a highly-esteemed hors d'oeuvre, but is hardly 
ever served otherwise. To serve it, cut some thin slices, 
arrange them on oblong or round glass dishes in rows 
overlapping one another. Ornament the sides alternately 
with little heaps of chopped capers and chopped parsley. 
Pour a little sweet oil over the fish just before sending 
to table. 

61. Croutes aux Eerevisses a la Tartare (Croutes 
of Crayfish, Tartare Style). — Procure six to eight small 
round dinner rolls (usually called farthing rolls) ; cut 
these in equal halves, scoop out the crumbs and allow 
the crusts to dry. In the meantime prepare a mixture 



HORS d'(euvres (cold). 'B81 

of eighteen large prawns picked, one large gherkin, six 
anchovy fillets, and the white part of a hard-boiled egg, 
all of which are minced rather fine. Put these into a 
basin and season with a ladleful of Tartare sauce ; put 
a little mustard and cress at the bottom of each crust 
and fill up with the preparation ; stamp out some thin 
slices of aspic jelly, cover the surface of each with a slice, 
fasten the heads of prawns in the centre of each with a 
little lobster butter ; ornament the edges with lobster 
butter. Dish up on small round dishes, garnish with 
parsley, and serve. 

62. Petites Cassolettes a rEpicurienne (Little 
Cases, Epicurean Style). — 2 oz. preserved lax, 2 oz. cooked 
ox tongue, 6 French olives, 1| oz. fresh butter, 2 French 
gherkins, 1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley, ^ teaspoon- 
ful of chopped tarragon and chervil, ^ table -spoonful of 
wine vinegar, 1 table-spoonful of sweet oil, ^ stick 
celery, about ^ lb. cassolette paste. 

Prepare the cassolette paste as given below, roll 
out very thin ; line ten or twelve little round fluted 
moulds, place a round of buttered paper in each, fill 
up with rice and bake for fifteen minutes in a mode- 
rately heated oven. Take out rice and papers, replace 
them on a baking sheet in the oven, so that they become 
quite crisp, then put on sieve to cool. Cut the lax, tongue, 
and gherkins into little strips ; season lightly with oil, 
vinegar, and chopped herbs ; fill the little cases carefully 
with this ; stone the olives, and place one in the centre 
of each. Cream the butter, put it in a forcing bag 
or paper cornet with a fancy piping tube, and ornament 
the edges and surface to taste. Keep in a cool place 
until required for table, then dish up on little round 
glass saucers, and garnish with tiny bunches of shredded 
celery and sprigs of parsley. 

63. Cassolette Paste. — ^ lb. flour, 1^ oz. butter,^ an 
egg, a little water, a teaspoonful of lemon juice, a pinch 
of salt. 

Put the flour into a basin, add the salt and rub in 
the butter until quite smooth ; then moisten with the 



382 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

egg, the lemon juice, and a very little water, mix the 
whole thoroughly, and work into a smooth but stiff 
paste. Use as directed. 

64. Rosettes aux Anchois. — 6 filleted anchovies, 
8 small mushrooms, 1 oz. anchovy paste, J oz. butter,^ 

1 hard-boiled egg, chopped parsley, green butter for 
garnish, bread for croutes, clarified butter for frying. 

Cut the bread mto slices about an eighth of an inch 
thick ; stamp out some rounds about 2| inches in 
diameter ; mix the butter and anchovy paste ; rub the 
yolk of egg through a sieve, and chop the white finely. 
Fry the rounds of bread a golden colour in clarified 
butter, drain, and cool. Spread thick on one side "svith 
anchovy butter ; cut the anchovy fillets into little strips 
and arrange on the croutes in the form of rosettes ; cut 
the stems of 8 small preserved mushrooms, and put the 
heads m the centre of each ; garnish with the hard- 
boiled white and yolk of egg and the chopped parsley, 
decorate by means of a paper cornet with green 
butter ; dish up on little glass dishes and serve. 

65. Canapes a la Turqiie. — 4^ oz. butter, 4 yolks 
of hard boiled egg, 4 Gorgona anchovies (boned), 3 oz. 
cooked lean ham, 1 oz. blanched parsley, spinach green- 
ing, 1 table- spoonful brown sauce, bread for croutes, and 
clarified butter. 

Cut some bread into slices about two inches long 
and half an inch wide ; fry these in clarified butter a 
golden colour and drain. Let cool. Pound the ham 
till fine, add a little sauce to produce a smooth paste, 
also ^ oz. butter and 1 yolk of hard-boiled egg. Spread 
thickly one side of the prepared bread croutes. Make 
three different kinds of butter : yellow by pounding 

2 yolks of egg and 2 oz. of butter ; the red by pound- 
ing 3 boned anchovies with 1 oz. butter and a little 
brown sauce ; and the green by pounding the blanched 
parsley with 1 oz. butter, 1 anchovy, and 1 yolk of 
egg. Season the butters to taste, and rub separately 
through a fine sieve. By means of a forcing bag with 
a rose pipe or a paper cornet, force out the prepared 



HORS d'(euvres (cold). 383 

butter alternately in the shape of crossbars on the 
croutes, dish up and serve cold. 

66. Appetissants, Macoimaise. — 3 hard-boiled eggs, 
1 truffle, 2 gherkins, 3 red chillies, 6 Gorgona ancho- 
vies, ^ gill well-reduced bechamel, 2 blanched mussels 
or sauce oysters, J oz. butter, a pinch pepper, bread 
for toast. 

Cut some slices of bread about ^ inch thick, toast it 
slightly, stamp out 8 to 10 rounds about IJ inches in 
diameter ; hollow out the centre portion of each suffi- 
ciently to receive the puree named below. Cut the eggs 
into slices about ^ inch thick, take out the yolk and put 
in a mortar with 4 filleted anchovies, mussels, or oysters, 
and the butter ; pound till smooth, season with a pinch 
of pepper, add the bechamel sauce, mix well and rub 
through a fine sieve. Fill the hollow part of the rounds 
of toast with this, garnish the surface of each with little 
strips of truffles, gherkins, chillies, and anchovies. These 
will look best if put on in the form of lattice- work. Put 
the remainder of the savoury puree in a paper cornet or 
forcing bag with a fancy tube, decorate the edges artisti- 
cally. Dish up on little glass dishes and serve. 

67. Canapes a la Turbigo. — 4 small rolls (farthing 
rolls), 10 prawns or 6 crayfish tails, 1 small head of 
celery, a few mixed pickles, a little aspic jelly, hard- 
boiled whites of egg, 2 small truffles, a spoonful tomato 
juice, capers, and parsley, remoulade sauce. 

Cut the prawns, celery, pickles and truffles into 
small dice. Mix with a little remoulade sauce, which is 
a stiff mayonnaise sauce mixed wdth finely-chopped 
parsley, fennel, tarragon leaves, shallots, and prepared 
mustard ; add to this just sufficient tomato puree to 
colour it. Cut the rolls in halves, scoop out the crumb, 
fill with the mixture, cover the surface with a thin 
round piece of aspic jelly. Garnish with strips of hard- 
boiled whites of egg, capers, truffles and parsley ; serve 
on small dishes. 

68. Tartines a la Baroda (Little Sandwiches, Baroda 
Styk).— 8 oz. Patna rice, ^ lb. cold chicken meat, 



384 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

2 oz. butter (fresh), ^ gill cream, 1 dessert- spoonful 
mulligatawny paste, 1 dessert-spoonful of chutney, 
1 table-spoonful Allemande or bechamel sauce, J pint 
white chaudfroid sauce, | teaspoonful curry powder, some 
aspic jelly, 6 slices of brown bread buttered. 

Cut up the chicken and put in a mortar together 
"vsith the butter, mulUgatawny paste, and chutney, pound 
well and add Allemande or bechamel sauce. When quite 
finely pounded rub all through a sieve, spread half the 
slices of brown bread thickly with a layer of this pre- 
paration ; if any is left over use it for garnish. Boil 
the rice, drain, dry, and mix with a little cream, and let 
cool. Cover the spread slices of bread with plain shoes 
of buttered brown bread, press together, cut into fingers, 
half- moon or heart shapes. Heat up the chaudfroid 
sauce, mix it with sufficient curry powder to give it a 
greenish tint. When nearly cold mask the slices thus 
prepared, and when the sauce is set glaze them with a 
coating of half- set aspic. Dress the rice on small round 
silver dishes in the shape of pyramids, dress the tar- 
tines neatly round each dish. Have ready some set 
aspic jelly, cut out diamond shapes and garnish the 
dishes with these, some sprigs of green salad, and some 
of the puree left over, which is best done by means of 
a paper cornet or forcing-bag. Keep the dishes on the 
ice until required for serving. 

69. Tartines a la Lucullus. — Take half a pound 
of puff paste, give it three consecutive turns, besprinkle 
the paste each turn with finely-grated Parmesan cheese. 
Roll out in two long strips about three inches wide and 
a quarter of an inch thick, and cut in two crossways. 
Mix a tablespoonful of anchovy paste with sufficient 
anchovy sauce to form a smooth paste. Spread this 
evenly over one side of the paste, and cover with the 
other strip. Cut it into small squares or oblong strips, 
place on a baking sheet, prick the surface of them with 
a fork, and bake in a moderately heated oven to a nice 
light brown. When baked put aside to cool. In the 
meantime pound the following in a mortar : — Two 



HORS d'ceuvres (cold). 385 

hard-boiled yolks of eggs, one ounce of fresh butter, 
one ounce of bloater paste, a table- spoonful of veloute or 
bechamel sauce, and three stoned Spanish olives. Put 
all through a fine sieve. Put into a small basin and 
season with a little cayenne. Put this puree in a 
paper cornet, cut the point, and form an ornamental 
border on the top of each tartine. Place half a stoned 
Spanish olive in the centre of each, curl a strip of 
anchovy fillet or lax round each olive, strew a few 
shreds of cornichons (pickled French gherkins) round 
the olives, dish up, and serve. 

70. Appetissants a la Suedoise. — 4 slices of stale 
brown bread, 2 hard-boiled eggs, 1^ oz. butter, 1 oz. 
anchovy paste, 4 Spanish olives, 2 gherkins, cooked 
beetroot, 4 slices preserved lax. 

Have the slices of bread about half an inch thick. 
Cut them into triangle shapes, trim down to a con- 
venient size. Hollow out the centre of each by means 
of a sharp-pointed knife. Fry these in clarified butter 
a nice golden colour, and drain. 

Mix the yolks of hard-boiled eggs, butter, and 
anchovy paste in a mortar, fill the cavity of triangles 
when cold with this puree. Cut the hard-boiled whites 
of eggs, gherkins, and beetroot into small strips. Stone 
the olives, cut in halves, and fill each with some of the 
above puree, place half a slice of preserved lax, neatly 
shaped, on top of this, and arrange the strips of gher- 
kin, egg, and beetroot alternately crosswise on each 
triangle so as to form a lattice pattern. Put a half of 
filled ohve in the centre of each, garnish with a few 
sprigs of parsley, and dish up. 

71. Nids a la Chartres. — 2 hard-boiled eggs, IJ oz. 
butter, ^ teaspoonful made mustard, 1 small tin or 
terrine foie-gras, salt and pepper, stale bread. 

Cut the bread into slices J inch thick. Stamp out 
eight rounds 1^ inches in diameter ; scoop out a little 
of the centre portion of each, fry in clarified butter a 
golden colour, and drain. Remove the fat from the 
foie-gras, cut out some small cubes with a |-inch cutter. 



386 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

Pound the trimmings of foie-gras (without any pieces 
of truffles) in a mortar, together with the butter and the 
yolks of hard-boiled eggs, add the mustard and season 
to taste, mix well and rulD through a coarse wire sieve 
on to the croutes of bread so as to cover the hollow 
sides completely with the puree as it comes through the 
sieve. Dish up carefully, place a cube of foie-gras in the 
centre of each ; garnish tastefully with hard-boiled white 
of egg, truffles, and a little chopped aspic if liked. 

72. Olives a la Tartare. — Stamp out some slices 
of brown bread with a 1-inch cutter. Have ready a gill 
of stiff Tartare sauce (see Sauces) in which has been 
incorporated half a gill of stiff aspic jelly. Dip each 
round of bread in the sauce to mask completely. Place 
them on a dish to set. Stone as many Spanish olives 
as there are rounds of bread, fill each with Tartare sauce, 
place one in the centre of each croute, dish up on little 
glass dishes, put a shrimp tail or small prawn tail in each 
oHve, garnish with parsley, and serve. 

The rounds of bread must be very thickly masked ; 
if not satisfactory at first, coat them for a second or 
third time. 

73. Petites Caisses a la Cassanova. — Cut half a 
head of w'ashed celery and one large truffle into fine 
Julienne strips. Season with a little mayonnaise or Tar- 
tare sauce ; fill about three parts some very small paper 
cases ; lay a slice of hard-boiled egg, cut out to size, on 
top of this, place a bearded oyster on each, and garnish 
tastefully with ravigote butter. This is best effected by 
means of a paper cornet. 

74. Simple Dishes. — A number of simple hors 
d'oeuvres may be prepared with various kinds of fancy 
butter, such as Montpellier, anchovy, lobster, crayfish, 
shrimp, ravigote, maitre d'hotel, and horseradish 
butter. Any of the above named can be shaped into 
little balls, tiny pats, or cubes, served on little squares 
of crisp toast, very small lunch biscuits, or Parmesan 
biscuits. 

Little balls of butter are sometimes dished neatly on 



HORs d'ceuyres (cold). 387 

small china or glass hors-d'oeuvre dishes. In that case, 
little pieces of toast or biscuits are handed round at the 
same time. 

75. Beurre Montpellier (Montpellier Butter). — 
2 oz. parsley, chervil, tarragon, chives and cress, 
2 anchovies, 9 yolks of hard-boiled eggs, 3 oz. butter, 
1 teaspoonful capers, 1 gherkin. 

Wash and pick the parsley, cress, and herbs ; 
blanch for three minutes, strain and cool. Drain well 
in a cloth and pound in a mortar. Put this on a plate, 
and clean the mortar. Wipe and bone the anchovies ; 
pound them in a mortar with the egg-yolks, capers, 
and gherkins. When quite smooth, add the butter and 
lastly the green puree. Mix the whole well together. 
Put through a wire sieve, and use as required. A little 
spinach greening may be added if the herbs should not 
colour the butter sufficiently. 

76. Beurre d'Anchois (Anchovy Butter). — 6 Gorgona 
anchovies, 2^ oz. butter, ^ lemon. 

Soak the anchovies in cold water, drain, take out 
the bones, wipe dry with a cloth, pound in a mortar 
with the butter ; add the juice of a lemon, rub through a 
fine sieve, spread on a plate, put on the ice and use as 
directed. 

77. Beurre de Homard (lobster Butter). — Procure 
the eggs and coral of a lobster, wash and dry well ; 
pound in a mortar with double its quantity of fresh 
butter. Eub through a fine sieve, and keep in a cool 
place till required. 

78. Beurre d'Ecrevisses (Crayfish or Shrimp 
Butter). — Pound ^ pint of pickled shrimps or prawns 
in a mortar till smooth, add 3 oz. of fresh butter, 4 oz. 
anchovy paste ; mix thoroughly and rub through a fine 
sieve. Keep on the ice till wanted. A little liquid 
carmine or cochineal may be added to colour if found 
necessary. 

79. Beurre Ravigote (Ravigote or Green Butter). — 
Wash and pick 1^ oz. chervil, 2 oz. spinach, ^ oz. green 
chives, 1 oz. tarragon, | oz. parsley. Put it in a sauce- 

25 



388 EECHERCHE COOKERY. 

pan with water and blanch. Drain well, and pound in 
a mortar. Peel three or four shallots, chop finely, cook 
them in a Httle butter until of a golden colour, and put 
with the herbs ; work in 6 oz. butter, rub through a 
fine sieve; add a little pepper and salt, and spinach 
greening if necessary. The butter is tlien ready for 
use. 

80. Beurre Maitre d'hotel (Maitre d'hotel Butter).— 
Mix 1 oz. of fresh butter with 1 teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, a sprig of tarragon, and 1 of chervil finely 
chopped, 1 teaspoonful of lemon juice, a pinch of salt 
and pepper. Spread on a plate, put on the ice, and 
shape into pats when quite firm. 

81. Beurre de Raifort (Horseradish Butter). — Wash 
a stick of horseradish, scrape off the outer skin, and 
grate finely the white part. Mix with 8 oz. butter, 1 
teaspoonful Chilli vinegar, and a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice ; season with pepper and salt. Rub through a 
fine sieve, spread on a plate, and put on the ice. Cut 
into diamond shapes or little rounds, and serve with 
grilled fillets of beef (tournedos) or steaks. 




CHAPTER III. 

SOUPS (POTAGES). 

82. Stock (Bouillon). — The stock is wisely called 
" the soul of cookery," for it forms the basis of soups, 
both thick and clear, purees and sauces. It is also 
used for various other culinary preparations. 

It consists really of the juice of meat, which is 
extracted by the process of long and gentle simmering 
— or, in other words, stock is made by extracting the 
goodness out of the material used into the liquor. 

The constituent parts of stock are : Osmazome, 
which is the substance obtained from animal fibre ; 
gelatine, which is the concentrated animal substance ; 
and fibrine, which is the albuminous substance found 
in blood (white of egg). Osmazome and the vegetables 
give the flavour, and the albumen and gelatine give 
the strength to stock ; and by gradual heat the albumi- 
nous matter will rise on top, forming the scum, bringing 
with it all impurities, which is removed before the stock 
actually boils. 

There are several ways of preparing stock. It may 
be made from bones, trimmings of joints, poultry and 
game, in conjunction with fresh meat, which is indis- 
pensable if a good stock is to be obtained. 

Bones, scraps of meat, gravy left over from joint, 
should not be thrown away, but ought to find their way 
to the stock-pot, so as to extract all the nutritious pro- 
perties. No good cook should ever be without a stock- 
pot, for where there is no stock-pot there is sure to 
be waste. 

Plenty of fresh vegetables (soup vegetables), and an 
appropriate quantity of soup herbs added to the stock 
are very essential. 



390 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

Copper tinned, or iron tinned stock-pots are the 
best for use, because they can be kept clean with greater 
ease than the cast-iron and the earthenware pots, which 
should be avoided for this purpose. 

83. General Stock for a good Soup. — 1 lb. of veal 
(knuckle part), 2 lbs. shin of beef (or shoulder part), 
3^ lbs. bones (beef or veal), 2 gallons water, 2 oz. salt, 
some poultry giblets (cleaned), 2 carrots, 2 onions, 3 leeks, 
1 head of celery, 2 cloves (stuck in the onions), 1 parsnip, 
12 peppercorns, 1 small bunch of sweet herbs, bayleaves, 
thyme, and plenty of parsley. 

If the meat used requires boning, take out the bones 
and tie up the meat with string ; break the bones with a 
chopper into pieces. Put both together with the gib- 
lets in the stock-pot ; add the salt and water (cold), and 
let it come gently to the boil. When nearly boiling 
remove the scum which will have risen to the top, pour 
in half a gill of cold water, and skim again. Have 
the above-named vegetables and herbs prepared, and 
add them to the stock with the peppercorns. Let the 
whole come to the boil ; skim again, remove the 
pot to the side of the stove, or if a gas-stove is used 
lower the flame, and let it simmer slowly for five hours. 
The fat which rises to the top during the process of 
simmering should be carefully taken off with a spoon. 
This fat should be put aside in a basin and used up with 
other fat when clarifying for frying purposes. As soon 
as the broth or stock is cooked sujfficiently, take out the 
meat and put it on a dish to be used up in some form 
or for second stock. Strain the broth through a wet 
napkin, colour it with a few drops of caramel if required 
for brown stock or soup. If required to be served thin, 
taste it and add a little more salt or pepper if it- be 
required. If required as stock it is best to keep it mth- 
out any additional seasoning and in its natural colour. 

84. Remouillage (Seconi Stock). — This is prepared 
by adding the same quantity of water to the meat, 
bones, and vegetables after being used for general or 
first stock. Any remains of meat or bones which can- 



SOUPS (POTAGES). 391 

not be used otherwise should find their way to the 
second stock. Let it simmer for four or five hours, 
keeping it well skimmed. Salt or other additional 
seasoning should be omitted, for this stock is only 
used for filling up others, already seasoned, or else for 
purees, sauces, &c., where the seasoning in their propor- 
tion will be found correctly described. When sufficiently 
simmered, pass it through a cloth, and use when re- 
quired ; or boil it down for meat glaze. 

Stock made from veal makes the best meat glaze ; 
but any kind of meat, poultry, or game stock can be 
reduced for glaze. 

85. Pot-aa-feu (Family Soup). — The pot-au-feu is 
what would here be termed the stock-pot. It figures as 
*' a standing dish" in every household in France, 
Germany, and Switzerland, as well as in other foreign 
countries where thrift, so to speak, is ingrained in the 
national character, and where cooking as an art is not 
monopolised by the rich alone. The pot-au-feu is on 
the simmer from the early morn until dinner-time, and 
many loose unconsidered trifles and scraps find their 
way to the stock-pot, or pot-au-feu. The art of culinary 
blending, however, produces a highly wholesome soup, 
which is at the same time nutritive and savoury. 

The following is a recipe which will produce a first- 
class soup with meat and vegetables, such, as a rule, as is 
served abroad : — 4 lbs. brisket of beef, 1 large onion, 2 
carrots, 4 cloves, 2 leeks, ^ cabbage, a small bunch of 
soup herbs, 12 pepper corns, salt, i lb. French bread, 1 
dessert- spoonful chopped parsley, 1^ gallons cold water. 
Wash the meat thoroughly in cold water (shin of 
beef may be substituted for brisket, but it will not be 
so useful for serving), cover it with the water, place it 
on the fire and let it come gently to a boil. Be careful 
to skim off all the scum which rises on top as the stock 
begins to boil. Wash and clean the vegetables, stick 
the cloves in the onion, tie up the leeks and cabbage, 
and put all in with the meat. Season with a table- 
spoonful of salt, add the pepper corns, and let the 



392 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

whole simmer gently for four hom-s. Take out the 
meat ; strain the broth into a tureen, cut the carrots, 
turnips, and leeks into round pieces, and put with the 
broth ; cut the bread in thin slices, and put it in the 
tureen, sprinkle the chopped parsley on top, and serve. 
Before straining the broth it should be tasted, and 
more seasoning added according to requirement and 
taste. The meat can with advantage be served, but as 
a separate course, or be used up in some form for 
another meal. 

86. Petites Marmites a la Parisienne. — This is a 
high-class pot- au- feu soup, served in small earthenware 
soup pots, which hold about half a pint of soup. Each 
guest is served with a small marmite, which should be 
handed round on hot soup plates covered with a folded 
napkin. It is usual to serve at the same time small 
sippets of toasted and buttered bread. If marrow-bones 
are used for this soup, they should be sawn into inch 
pieces. These are likewise handed round with the 
soup. 

4 lbs. buttock steak, 1^ lbs. beef bones, ^ lb. 
knuckle of veal, some chicken giblets if handy, 2 sticks 
of leek, 2 cloves, ^ chicken, ^ celery root, 1 small onion, 
2 small carrots, 1 turnip, ^ cabbage, 12 peppercorns, 
salt, parsley, (a marrow bone). 

Use an enamelled soup- pot or a French stone 
marmite. Tie up the meat with string, put it in the 
soup- pot with 6 to 7 quarts of cold water or stock ; 
bring it slowly to a boil, take off the scum. Wash 
clean and trim the vegetables. Roast the bones and 
giblets and chicken with a little butter in a saute -pan 
over the fire. Remove the fat and put this with the 
soup, tie up the leeks and cabbage, add these together 
with the carrots, turnip, onion (stuck with 2 cloves), 
celery, and parsley to the soup ; let it come gently to a 
boil, skim, season lightly with salt, and add a dozen 
peppercorns. Let the whole simmer very slowly for 
about three hours. It is very essential that it should 
simmer slowly and continously so as to ensure a clear 



SOUPS (POTAGES). 393 

broth with the needful nourishment, which can only be 
obtained by a slow process of cooking. Remove the 
meat and chicken, cut the former in convenient 
pieces, allowing one slice for each person ; cut the 
chicken into small joints. Put the pieces in a clean 
stew-pan, strain the broth through a fine sieve or 
strainer, and put with the pieces. Cut the cabbage, 
leek, carrots, and turnip into small pieces or slices, 
moisten them with broth, and keep hot. Let the soup 
simmer for another half an hour. Season to taste. 
Put equal proportions of vegetables, beef, and chicken 
in little soup-pots (this soup should be served in very 
small French marmites, sufficiently large to hold 
enough soup for one person), pour in the broth, sprinkle 
over each a little chopped parsley or chives, and serve 
with toasted bread sippets, [f a marrow-bone is used 
saw it into small pieces about an inch long, wrap up in 
little pieces of linen or muslin, cook with the soup, 
and serve as directed. If any pieces of meat are left 
over, make them up into a salad, or use up in some 
other form. 

87. Croute-au-pot. — 2 quarts of good first stock, 
1 carrot, 1 turnip, | cabbage, 2 oz. butter, 1 dinner roll, 
parsley or chives, pepper and salt, nutmeg. 

The stock should be made from beef and veal and 
bones, well skimmed, but need not necessarily be clarified. 
The vegetables, after being washed and pared, may be 
cooked whole in the stock-pot. Cut the carrot and 
turnip into round slices, drain the cabbage and cut into 
small pieces ; put all the vegetables in a stewpan with 
the butter, cover and cook slowly for about ten minutes. 
Season with pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg. 
Strain the stock on to the vegetables, and let simmer 
for about thirty minutes ; skim occasionally. Cut the 
roll into thin round slices, place them on a baking sheets 
bake them on both sides a golden brown in a moderate 
oven. Put them in a soup tureen, moisten with a little 
stock, pour the soup over, sprinkle over a little chopped 
parsley or chives, and serve. 



394 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

88. Consommes in General. — Clarification. — 1 gallon 
of stock, 1 lb. lean beef, 1 onion, 1 carrot, | leek, 
2 cloves, \ bay-leaf, \ head celery, a few sprigs parsley, 
1 sprig thyme and marjoram, 12 peppercorns, 2 sprigs 
tarragon and chervil, 3 whites of Qgg and shell, 1 glass 
sherry, 1 of brandy, \ lemon or 1 dessert-spoonful French 
vinegar, salt, sugar. 

The stock should be cold for clarifying. Eemove all 
the fat. Prepare the vegetebles, wash and cut into 
small slices, put it together with the herbs, cloves, bay- 
leaf, and peppercorns in a well-tinned stewpan. Pass 
the meat through a mincing machine several times, or 
chop finely. Whisk the whites of e^g a little and put 
with the meat, moisten with a table- spoonful of cold 
water ; put this, with the shells along with the stock, 
into the stewpan containing the vegetables. Stir over 
the fire until it commences to boil, then add the wine 
and brandy, and let simmer gently for about fifteen 
minutes. Season to taste with salt and a pinch of 
castor sugar. Strain through a cloth ; it is then ready 
for use. 

89. Royal pour Consommes (Savoury Custard for 
Clear Soup). — 2 whole eggs, 2 yolks of egg, 1 gill white 
stock, 1 table- spoonful cream, pepper, salt, grated 
nutmeg. 

Break the eggs and put into a basin, add the stock 
and cream, season to taste with pepper, salt, and a pinch 
of grated nutmeg, strain and fill into a well-buttered 
plain mould. Cover with a buttered paper, stand it in 
a scewpan or saute-pan three-parts filled with hot water. 
Cook gently on the stove or in the oven until set, take 
out, let cool, turn on to a plate, cut into diamonds, 
lozenge-shapes, rounds, or small dice. Serve in clear 
soups or purees as directed. 

90. Consomme de Volaille (Clear Chicken Broth). — 
1 fowl, 1^ lb. lean veal, 2 lbs. lean beef, 1 onion, 2 carrots, 
1 turnip, 1 stick of celery, 2 leeks, 3 cloves, 1 parsley 
root, 2 gallons of water, salt. 

Truss the fowl the same as for boiling, preserve the 



SOUPS (POTAGES). 395 

giblets, clean and wash and put them with the fowl, 
beef, and veal in a stock-pot, add two table- spoonfuls of

with a whisk and pour in the above quantity of soup, 
then return to the stewpan, stir over the fire for a few 
minutes longer, taking care not to let it boil again ; a 
quart of tomato puree added in place of a quart of con-

Cook the flour and one ounce of butter together 
without browning, stir in the stock and mushroom 
liquor, add the bouquet and crushed peppercorns, boil 
slowly for 20 minutes, stir frequently, and skim. Pass 
through a sieve or tammy ; keep on the side of the 
stove, put a few tiny pieces of butter on top to keep 
from forming a skin. Just before using it add the 
cream. Stir well and let it get thoroughly hot without 
boiling, season with salt if necessary, a pinch of nutmeg,

chicken, rabbit, or veal), mix thoroughly and add the 
butter gradually, season with pepper and salt, and the 
lemon juice. Pass through a tammy and use. Before 
adding the butter the sauce should be sufficiently 
heated to bind the eggs. Great care must be taken to 
prevent it curdling. Another way to make this sauce 
is to omit the bechamel, and to use four yolks of eggs to 
half a gill of stock, which is finished with four ounces of 
butter. The first is the most convenient and most 
popular way. This sauce when finished is to, be just 
hot, and on no account must it be allowed to reach the 
boiling point. 

171. Sauce Blanquette. — This is exactly the same as 
Sauce Allemande, adding three tablespoonfuls cream

worked in and is absorbed in the sauce. The sauce 
when finished will have the appearance of a frothy 
cream, and should then be passed through a tammy 
cloth. Just before serving finish off with a few drops 
of lemon juice, a pinch of salt, and a grate of nutmeg 
should be added during the process of whisking. Served 
with fillets of veal or fowl, asparagus or artichokes.

mirepoix with the stock, claret, sherry, and tomato 
pulp, boil gently for about an hour. Skim occasionally. 

In the meantime prepare a roux by melting 3 oz. 
of butter in a stewpan, stir in the flour and cook very 
slowly over a slow fire, stirring all the while with a 
wooden spoon until of a brown colour ; or place the 
stewpan in the oven and cook there until brown, 
stirring from time to time to prevent it from burning, 
and to blend the flour better. Allow the roux to cool 
a little, pour in gradually the prepared stock, &c., stir 
over the fire until it boils, let simmer slowly for another ^ 
hour, skim well, and pass through a tammy cloth or 
fine sieve. If found too thick, add a little more stock.

sauce, stir occasionally until quite cool. Keep the sauce 
in a stone vessel or pan until wanted. Be sure and boil

CHAPTER V. 

GARNITUEES AND DECORATIONS 
FOR COOKED FOODS. 

Garnitures in most cases are a matter of taste and 
knack ; after a certain amount of experience the gar- 
nishings suitable for certain dishes may be prepared 
with httle trouble, and without going in for elaborate 
recipes, and can be made to look inviting and to taste 
delicious. 

In order to give a dish of cutlets, a ham, a leg of 
lamb or mutton a neater appearance, a frill is put over 
the bones, which are sometimes made unsightly by the 
cooking. Silver skewers or atelets (hatelets) are 
principally used for cold dishes, such as capons, fowls, 
beef, tongue and hams, galantines, and other fish or 
meat dishes. 

These consist as a rule of truffles, cocks' combs, 
and mushrooms, which are fastened on to skewers 
together with vegetables, cut into fancy shapes, and 
white of egg (hard boiled), and set in various tints of 
aspic jelly. 

The various garnitures described are those which 
are recognised as correct and mostly known under the 
names given. These refer principally to Removes or 
Releves, but may easily be adopted for Entrees, &c. 
unless otherwise stated. 

238. Garnishing^ a I'Allemande. — Godivean or

398. Cotelettes de Veau a la Francaise. — 5 or 6 bones 
of best end of neck of veal, 2 oz. butter, 1 teaspoonful 
chopped herbs, 1 teaspoonful chopped lemon rind, 
6 tablespoonfuls breadcrumbs, pepper and salt, 2 egg- 
yolks, tomato sauce, No. 202. 

Saw off the chine-bone and the upper part of the 
rib-bones of the neck, thus leaving the rib-bones about 
3 inches long. Divide into cutlets, flatten with a 
cutlet-bat, trim neatly, and season. Melt about ^ oz. 
butter, beat up the egg-yolks and mix together on a 
plate, add the lemon rind and chopped herbs, and mix 
thoroughly ; dip the cutlets into this, and then into the 
breadcrumbs. Melt the remainder of butter in a 
saute or frying-pan, and fry the cutlets a golden colour. 
Drain, dish up, put a frill on each bone, and serve with 
tomato or demi-glace sauce. 

399. Escalopes de Veau a la Russe. — About 2^ lb.

beat them with a cutlet-bat, and shape neatly. Put 

2 oz. butter in a saute-pan ; when hot, put in the 
scallops and fry over a quick fire a nice light-brown 
colour. As the meat will afterwards be cooked again, 
the frying process should be done quickly without 
actually cooking the scallops or cutlets. Place them 
between two boards, put a weight not too heavy over the 
top, and keep them until cold. Strain the butter, and 
keep for further use. Cut the pork and marrow into 
small pieces, pound in a mortar ; when fine, add the 
anchovy paste, savoury herbs, egg-yolk, and a small 
piece of butter about the size of a nutmeg. Pound 
thoroughly until smooth, season with pepper and salt, 
rub through a fine sieve, and cover one side of each 
scallop thickly with this farce. Put them on a buttered 
baking-sheet, cover over with a few fried breadcrumbs, 
sprinkle with oiled butter, and place in a hot oven for

bacon in a buttered sautoir, range the meat on this, 
season with salt and pepper, moisten with a glass of 
white wine and some white stock, cover with a buttered 
paper, and set to braise in the oven for about an hour, 
during which time care should be taken to baste from 
time to time. In the meantime have ready some veal 
forcemeat, and fill up a flat border mould (well buttered), 
which steam in a stewpan ; turn out on a dish and keep 
warm. When the grenadins are done, range them in

slices or mince coarsely, put it in a small stewpan 
together with the mushrooms and the truffle finely 
chopped, and sufficient Veloute sauce to moisten ; add a 
small piece of butter, and stir over the fire until hot. 
This forms the salpicon. Rub some cooked potatoes 
through a fine sieve, mix them with a piece of butter 
and a little cream. Season with salt, pepper and 
nutmeg. Let the puree get thoroughly hot, then add 
the yolk of an egg, and work it well until it forms a

paste, and then with the point of a knife cut out the 
shape, turn the paste over on to a baking-sheet, brush 
the surface with beaten egg-yolk. Make an incision 
with the point of a knife in the shape of a ring about an 
inch from the edge (this is to form the lid). Trace a few 
lines across the surface of the centre ring and bake it in 
an evenly heated oven ; the time required for baking is 
from forty to forty-five minutes. Carefully remove the 
lid, scoop out the soft parts ; keep warm until required 
for filling. Blanch the sweetbreads, cool, drain, and 
trim, cut them into slices. Melt the butter in a saute- 
pan, lay in the slices of sweetbread, season with salt, 
pepper, and a pinch of grated nutmeg. Moisten with 
the white stock and wine, cover with a buttered paper, 
and cook slowly over the fire or in the oven until 
tender. Take off the butter, add the sauce, the sliced

found too liquid, strain it off and reduce to the desired 
consistency). Mix the yolks of two eggs with the cream 
and add to the sauce ; stir gently over the tire until 
the eggs bind without boiling, and keep hot in the bain- 
marie until required for serving. Fill the puff paste 
crust with the prepared ragout, put on the cover, and 
serve on a round, hot dish with a folded napkin.

savoury herbs, a little flour, one whole and one yolk 
of egg, season with salt, pepper, and a httle grated 
nutmeg. Form some even-sized balls, flatten each 
with the palm of your hand to give them the shape 
of round fillets. Peel and slice the onions, cut some 
of the slices from the centre of each onion, rather 
thicker than the rest, divide the rings carefully, and 
reserve the largest for frying separately. Dissolve 
about an ounce of butter in a frying-pan, and fry the 
divided onions until of a golden colour ; put them in 
a small stewpan, with sufficient broTsu sauce to keep 
moist, and allow to simmer gently for about twenty

the fillets, on the top of each fillet ; thus prepared, press 
slightly together. Cover over completely with a thin 
layer of farce, chop finely the trimmings of truffle, dip 
the fillets in white of egg, sprinkle the surface with 
chopped truffle. Melt the butter in a saute-pan ; when

440. Cotelettes de Mouton an Naturel. — Procure 
the best end of a neck of mutton, saw off the upper part 
of the rib-bones, so as to leave the bones of the cutlets 
about 3 inches long. Saw oft' the spine-bone, close to 
the end of the ribs, cut or trim off the flat bones adher- 
ing to the thick end of the neck, cut slantwise into 
cutlets. Flatten each a little and pare neatly, and with- 
out waste; cut off the skin on the side of each bone, and 
scrape the ends of the bones ; season with pepper and 
salt, brush over with oiled butter, and grill ; or melt about 
an ounce of butter in a saute-pan, put in the cutlets 
when hot, and broil on both sides over a brisk fire. Dish 
up and serve with plain gravy.

soubise sauce, No. 180, piled up in the centre, and 
serve. 

442. Cotelettes de Mouton a la Provencale. — 
Prepare the cutlets as before, oil them slightly with 
salad oil (huile de Provence). Broil them on one side 
only, and put them on a dish to get cold. Season the 
cutlets with pepper and salt. Spread the cooked side 
thickly with Puree a la Proven9ale, No. 180, cover with 
a mixture of breadcrumbs and grated Parmesan cheese. 
Put 1 oz. butter in a saute-pan ; when hot, lay in the 
cutlets raw side downwards, baste the surface with oiled 
butter, and cook in a hot oven for ten minutes. Dish up 
in a circle, garnish the centre with small rounds of 
potatoes (pommes Parisienne), pour round some demi- 
glace, and serve. 

443. Cotelettes de Mouton a la Princesse. — Trim 
ten to twelve small mutton cutlets in the usual way, 
parbroil them in butter, lay between two baking- sheets 
to press ; when cold, cover one side of them with a thin 
layer of chicken forcemeat, No. 231, mixed with finely- 
minced mushrooms and truffles; dip them in stiffly 
reduced Madere sauce ; set them on the ice to set the 
sauce quite firm on the cutlets ; dip them in egg and 
crumbs, fry in clarified butter, strain on a cloth. Dish 
up in circular form, fill the centre of the dish with 
cooked asparagus points (mixed with a few fresh peas if 
desired), sauce round with Perigord sauce, No. 192, and

part, some strips of raw ham and larding bacon. Put 
the cutlets in a stewpan with the trimming (but no fat), 
a small sliced carrot, half an onion stuck with a clove, 
and a slice of parsley root or celery. Add a quart of 
mutton stock, season with pepper and salt, and allow 
to cook slowly for about an hour. When done drain 



530 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

the cutlets, press them between two boards and let them 
cool. Add a gill of Espagnole sauce, No. 184, to the 
fond, reduce well and strain. Add a dessert- spoonful of 
finely chopped parsley and three tarragon leaves to the 
sauce, immerse the cutlets in this and let cool again. 
Dip in beaten egg and milk, roll in breadcrumbs, and 
fry in hot fat or butter. Drain on a cloth, dish up in a 
circle. Have ready a ragout of sheeps' kidneys, fill the 
centre with same, put a few warm green peas on top,

445. Filets de Mouton a la Tyrolienne. — About 
3 lbs. best end of a neck of mutton, 4 small even-sized 
tomatoes, 12 button onions, 1 tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley, 1 gill of sweet oil, | gill Orleans vinegar, 1 
minced shallot, 1 bay leaf, a clove of garlic, salt, 2 oz. 
ham, 1 gill demi-glace sauce. No. 164, 1 gill stock, 1 oz. 
butter, 1 egg, breadcrumbs, frying fat. 

Remove the meat from the bones of the neck of 
mutton, cut it into eight nice fillets. Trim off some of 
the fat and lay them in a marinade for 12 hours. The 
marinade in this case consists of the oil, vinegar, shallot, 
bay leaf, garlic, coarsely chopped parsley, and salt. It 
is advisable to turn the fillets from time to time. Cut 
the tomatoes in halves and squeeze out a little of the 
pulp. Peel the button onions, fry them a golden colour 
in the butter. When this is done pour off the butter. 
Add the stock, and let come to the boil quickly ; skim 
well, and braise in the oven until done ; the stock should, 
by the time the onions are done, be reduced so as to glaze 
them completely. Put the butter left from the onions 
in a saute-pan, place in the tomatoes, season with 
pepper and salt, and fry gently for a few minutes. Take 
out the fillets fr'om the marinade, wipe dry with a cloth, 
egg and crumb them, and fry in hot fat to a golden 
brown. They must cook slowly, else they will not be 
done by the time they are of the desired colour. Range 
the fillets neatly in a row in the centre of an oblong 
dish. Have ready the ham finely chopped and warmed 
in a little brown sauce, just sufficient to moisten. Put 



ENTREES (hot). 531 

a dessert-spoonful of the ham in each half of tomato, 
place a button onion on top of each. Pour the demi- 
glace sauce round the dish and serve. The demi-glace 
should be well reduced, and have a tablespoonful of the 
marinade incorporated during the process of reducing. 

446. Rognons de Mouton a la Chinoise. — Six small 
sheeps' kidneys, six yolks of eggs, 2 oz. butter, f pint 
cooked asparagus points, 2 tablespoonfuls bechamel or 
Veloute sauce, chopped parsley, 1 gill tomato sauce, 

1 gill of oil, pepper and salt. 

Skin and wipe the kidneys. Split each without 
dividing entirely, and fasten on skewers. Season with 
pepper and salt. Melt 1 oz. of butter, and butter the 
kidneys thoroughly on both sides. Broil them over a 
clear fire from six to eight minutes. In the meantime 
put the remainder of the butter in a saute-pan ; when 
hot, put in the asparagus points, toss over the fire till 
hot, moisten with the white sauce. Add a little pepper, 
salt, and the chopped parsley. Fry the yolks of eggs 
separately in hot oil and strain. Take up the kidneys, 
put a tablespoonful of asparagus points in the centre of 
each, place the fried yolks on top, dish up, pour round 
some hot tomato sauce, No. 202, and serve. 

447. Petites Timbales a la Meridonlae (Little 
Timbales Meridonale Style). — | lb. lean mutton fillet,

cream, | oz. butter, and the eggs, one at a time, season 
to taste, mix well, and rub through a sieve. Butter 
eight to ten small timbale or dariole moulds, fill them 
with this preparation, leaving a small hollow in the 
centre of each, in which place about a dessert-spoonful 
of reduced tomato sauce and an olive stuffed with force- 
meat ; cover well with forcemeat, and place the moulds

A border of mashed potatoes brushed over with egg, 
and baked in the oven, will serve well as a base for the 
fillets, and greatly improves the appearance of the dish. 

449. Cotelettes de Pore a la Robert. — Cut eight to 
nine small pork cutlets from the best end of the neck 
of pork. Trim and pare neatly, leaving about half an 
inch of fat round each cutlet. Put the cutlets in a 
deep dish, season with pepper and salt and chopped 
parsley, pour over two tablespoonfuls sweet oil, allow

452. Medallions de Sanglier a la Russe. — Take 
about two pounds of lean wild boar (loin or leg is best). 
Cut from them some slices about ^-inch thick, flatten 
these a little with a bat, and shape them into neat 
rounds. Place them m a shallow earthenware dish, 
sprmkle over with two tablespoonfuls of olive oil, two

also a small bunch of parsley and half a bayleaf. Bring 
it gently to the boil, season with pepper, salt, and a very 
little grated nutmeg, add also a teaspoonful of red- cur- 
rant jelly and the juice of half a sour orange. Let it 
simmer slowly for about thirty to forty minutes. Skim 
ofl' the fat, remove the herbs, and if too thick add a 
little more stock or water. Have ready sufficient plain 
boiled rice to make a border. Dress the pieces of 
chicken neatly in the centre of the border, together with 
the garniture and sauce. Have ready the thin rind of half 
an orange finely shred, and warmed; strew same over 
the centre, garnish with a few fleurons of puff-paste, 
and serve.

pieces of chicken, season with pepper and salt, and fry 
a light brown over a quick fire ; add the onion, finely 
chopped, and the ham, cut into slices or squares. Fry 
a few minutes longer, drain off the fat, add the sherry 
and Espagnole sauce, and let simmer slowly for about 
half-an-hour. Wash the rice, blanch it in slightly 
salted water, drain and cook till tender with a little 
stock and the game sauce ; season with pepper and 
salt. Put the rice in a buttered plain-border mould, 
pack tightly, and turn out on a hot dish. Chop the 
mushrooms finely, put with the chicken, add a few 
drops of lemon juice, cook a few minutes longer. Dish 
up the chicken in the centre of the rice, slip a little 
cutlet frill on each end of the legs before the sauce and 
garnish are added, and serve.

ENTREES (hot). 537 

2 yolks of eggs, 1 hard-boiled egg, salt, pepper, 1 truffle, 
a croiite of fried bread. 

Draw, wipe, and singe the chicken, cut it into neat 
joints (it should make twelve nice pieces), melt the 
butter in a saute-pan ; when hot, put in the pieces, season 
with pepper and salt, and fry a golden colour over a 
brisk fire. Add the shallot, finely chopped, at the last 
moment, so as to blend a little ; now add the sherry, 
cover and reduce a little, then add tomato and Espagnole 
sauce, put on the lid, and let simmer gently for about 
forty minutes. Eoll out the paste, butter six or more 
little dariole moulds and line them wath the paste ; line 
the inside with greased paper, fill them up with raw 
rice or dried peas, and bake in a moderately-heated oven 
for fifteen minutes, or until they are of a nice golden 
colour. Turn out the rice, remove the paper, and fill 
with the following mixture : Cut the ham and game or 
beef into small pieces, and pound in a mortar till smooth ; 
add the bechamel sauce, butter, and hard-boiled yolk of 
egg, pound well, work in the two raw yolks, season with 
pepper and salt, and rub through a wire sieve. Cut the 
truffle into slices and stamp out as many rounds as you 
have cases ; chop the trimmings finely and mix with the 
above. The filling must be done very carefully, and is 
best performed with a forcing-bag. Sprinkle the sur- 
face with grated cheese and bake for ten minutes in a 
moderate oven. Dish up the chicken on a croute of 
fried bread, fixed on a hot dish by means of a little 
batter or white of egg. Skim off the fat from the sauce 
and strain over the chicken. Cut some slices of hard- 
boiled white of egg, stamp out neatly some triangle or 
heart shapes, cut out the centre so as to receive the 
slices of truffle previously prepared ; place these taste- 
fully on the baked cases, and dress them round the 
croute. Garnish with a few sprigs of parsley and 
serve. 

N.B. — These croutades or timbales make a very 
pretty second course or savoury dish, served by them- 
selves or as a garnish.

In drawing the duckling, save the heart and liver, 
remove the gall, wash and chop all fine ; season with 
salt, pepper, and a pinch of ground spice. Peel and 
boil the onion in stock or water, chop finely. Put the 
chopped onion, liver, &c., in a basin, add the Cognac, 
chopped parsley, and breadcrumbs, melt an ounce of butter, 
mix this well with the stuffing, adding sufficient stock 
to moisten, and put in the interior of the ducklings. 
Fasten both ends with string and truss them. Melt 
2 oz. of butter in a braising-pan, fry the shallots a 
little, put in the duckling, and cook over the fire long 
enough to take colour, take it out, put in the fiour 
and brown a little, pour in the claret and stock, let it 
come to a boil. Replace the duckling, add the bouquet 
garni, and a few drops of lemon juice. Cover with a 
lid or buttered paper, and braise in the oven until 
tender. Take out the duckling, joint it, but keep in 
shape, and dish up on a hot dish. Strain the sauce. 
Keduce a little, strain through a napkin or pointed 
strainer, sauce over and round the duckling, and serve 
as Remove or Entree. 

Note. — Rouenese ducklings are considered superior 
for this dish to those obtained elsewhere. In Rouen 
they do not bleed the ducks, but kill them by thrusting 
a skewer through the brain, thus keeping the blood in 
the flesh ; this, together with a very careful method of 
feeding, accounts in a great measure for the superiority 
of their ducklings and ducks. 

508. Pintade Rotie au Cresson (Roast Guinea-fowl 
with Cresses). — Singe, draw, and wipe two guinea-fowls, 
place a piece of fat bacon inside each, and truss for roast- 
mg. Wrap up each fowl in a piece of buttered paper and 
roast in front of a brisk fire for half an hour or a little 
longer, baste well with butter or dripping while roasting. 
When done, take up, untruss, dish up, surround with 
freshly picked and washed watercress, seasoned with 
salt, pepper, a little vinegar, and oil (two tablespoonfuls 
of oil to one of vinegar). Serve with fried bread- 
crumbs, No. 516, bread sauce, No. 183, and gravy. 



568 KECHERCHE COOKERY. 

509. Poularde Rotie. — Singe, draw, and truss a 
large poularde, wliicli is a large spring chicken which 
has been fattened up. Baste well with butter or drip- 
ping, roast in front of a brisk fire or bake in a hot oven. 
Baste well with fat and turn frequently during the 
process of cooking ; dredge with a little flour when 
almost done. Take up, pour off the fat from the drip- 
ping-pan, add sufficient brown stock to make the gravy, 
boil up ; whilst stirring, season with pepper and salt, and 
strain. Garnish the dish with cress, endive, or water- 
cress salad, and serve with a boat of bread sauce, No. 188. 

510. Faisan Barde au Cresson. — Pick, draw, singe, 
and truss one or more pheasants. Cover .the breast 
with a thin sheet of fat bacon (larding bacon) tied on 
with some thin string, roast it for 30 to 40 minutes, 
according to the size of the bird. Remove the string, 
dish up, garnish with bunches of picked watercress, 
seasoned with a little oil and vinegar. Serve with 
gravy, bread sauce, No. 183, and fried breadcrumbs, 
No. 516. 

511. Lievre Farci, EtoufFe (Stuffed Hare, Braised). 

1 hare, 6 oz. cold poultry or game, 6 mushrooms, 1 egg, 

2 oz. breadcrumbs, ^ dessert-spoonful of aromatic 
seasoning, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, 1 of chopped 
chives, 1 carrot, 1 onion, 3 cloves, 2 shallots, a bouquet 
of herbs, 2 glasses red wine, 1 gill brown stock, | pint 
brown sauce, larding bacon, 4 oz. lean bacon, pepper 
and salt. 

Skin, draw, wash, and wipe the hare ; cut out some 
of the fleshy parts from the sides or underneath, where 
it will show least, clean and wash the liver and heart ; 
chop these and the flesh cut up very finely, chop like- 
wise the cooked game or poultry, previously freed from 
skin, bone, and gristle, also the mushrooms ; peel and 
chop the shallots. Put the chopped ingredients in a 
basin, add the breadcrumbs, aromatic seasoning, 
parsley, and chives ; mix well and moisten with the egg. 
Stuff the hare with this, and truss and skewer it. Lard 
the breast and sides with strips of larding bacon; cut 



REMOVES AND ROASTS, WITH HINTS ON CARVING. 569 

the lean bacon, carrot, and onion into slices and put 
into a saute-pan or braisoire, add the cloves and 
bouquet garni. Place the hare in the pan, moisten 
with the wine and stock, cover with buttered paper, 
and braise in a moderately heated oven for two hours ; 
baste occasionally. During the last half-hour add the 
sauce, previously heated. Take out the hare, remove 
the skewers and string and put on a hot dish, strain the 
sauce into a stewpan, skim off the fat, season with pepper 
and salt to taste, let simmer for a few minutes. Pour 
the sauce over the hare, or, if preferred, serve it separately 
in a sauce-boat. A garniture of quenelles Godivean 
and mushroom heads and truffles dressed in groups 
round the dish will improve the dish, especially if 
served as a Remove. 

512. Coq de Bruyere Roti (Roast Grouse).— Grouse 
should, like most game birds, be well hung if required 
for roasting purposes. It is advisable to keep them hung 
unplucked for about a week. Great care must be taken 
in plucking so as not to injure the skin, which is more 
delicate when birds have hung than it is when 
freshly killed. When plucked, singe, draw, and truss 
the grouse similar to fowls. Mix some butter with a 
little pepper and put a piece of butter about the size of 
a nutmeg into the body of each bird ; hang before a 
brisk fire or place in a tin if done in the oven ; the 
former method, however, is the best and more correct 
way. In each case the birds must be very liberally 
basted with either oiled butter or hot bacon fat. Well 
hung or high game should always be well cooked. 
Grouse take from 45 minutes to an hour, according to 
size. If cooked in the oven a thick piece of toasted 
buttered bread should be placed under each bird ; the 
toast thus used is served with the bird. When done, 
take up, untruss, place on a hot dish, garnish with 
watercresses and fried breadcrumbs, No. 516, and 
serve with gravy and bread sauce. 

513. Becasses aux Huitres. — One brace of wood- 
cocks, 18 oysters, 3 yolks of eggs, 2 oz. breadcrumbs, 



570 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

1 oz. butter, j gill cream, lemon juice, pepper and salt, 
mace, ^ pint demi -glace. 

Pick, draw, and wipe the woodcocks ; beard the 
oysters and cut them in quarters. Mix the bread- 
crumbs with the egg yolks, the cream, and butter, add a 
few drops of lemon juice, a pinch of ground mace, and 
pepper and salt to taste ; mix with the oysters and stuff 
the bn'ds with this ; sew^ up and truss for roasting. Put 
the birds in a roasting-tin wdth a little dripping and bake 
in a quick oven from 30 to 40 minutes ; baste occasionally. 
When done, un truss, dish up on two pieces of toasted 
bread, and serve with demi-glace sauce. 

514. Perdreaux Rotis a TEspagnole (Roast Par- 
tridge, Spanish Style). — Procure a pair of partridges 
ready trussed for roasting. Put two well- wiped Gorgona 
anchovies in the body of each bird. Line a small 
roasting-tin with a few rashers of bacon, put a layer of 
sliced tomatoes on top, place in the partridges. Add 
sufficient salt and pepper to season, also a few sprigs of 
parsley, baste well with oiled butter, and roast in the 
oven for a good half-hour. Baste occasionally. When 
done take out the birds, untruss, dish up on a hot 
dish, skim off the fat from the gravy. Add a teaspoon- 
lul of soy to colour it ; also a gill of good stock. Boil 
up and cook for a few minutes, then strain over the 
birds and serve. 

515. Perdreaux a la Crapodine (Partridges, Ciapo- 
dine Style). — Fresh-killed partridges are best for this 
dish. Pluck, singe, and draw the birds, split each bird 
down the back, spread open, wipe the inside, flatten 
with a cutlet-bat, and skewer them so as to keep 
liat. Brush over well with sweet salad oil, season with 
salt and pepper, dip in fresh breadcrumbs, sprinkle over 
some more oil, place them on a gridiron previously 
cleaned and rubbed with a piece of fat bacon. Grill on a 
brisk fire at first and finish over a slow fire ; they will 
take from 20 to 25 minutes, according to the size of the 
birds. Remove the skewers. Dress the partridges on a 
liot dish pyramid fashion, and send to table accom- 



REMOVES AND ROASTS, WITH HINTS ON CARVING. 571 

panied with a boat of Remoulade sauce, No. 218. 
Great care must be bestowed on the grilhng, so as not to 
let them brown ; the birds should be of a light-brown 
colour. 

516. Fried Breadcrumbs. — Put 3 oz. of fresh 
breadcrumbs in a frying-pan with about J oz. of butter. 
Fry over the fire a light-brown colour, stirring 
continually, and place on a sieve for a few minutes 
before the fire to drain. 

617. PerdreauxRotis al'Anglaise. — Procure apair of 
well-hung partridges ready trussed for roasting. Hang 
them before a brisk fire and baste well with oiled 
butter. They will require about 20 minutes to cook, 
but need occasionally basting. When done untruss, 
dish up on a piece of toasted or fried bread ; garnish 
with a handful of well washed and picked water- 
cress and fried breadcrumbs. Serve with gravy and 
bread sauce. 



517a. PRACTICAL HINTS ON CARVING. 

A bird or a joint of meat badly carved will prove 
wasteful, because fewer persons will be served than 
would be when well and properly carved. 

Anything which needs to be carved at table should 
be dished on a dish sufficiently large to allow the joint 
to be turned, if needed, without moving the dish from 
its position. 

The dish should be placed close in front of the 
carver. The knife used for carving must be light and 
sharp, and of a convenient size. 

Such joints as ham, veal, and beef should be cut 
very thin ; whilst pork, lamb, and mutton should be 
cut a trifle thicker. The carver ought to be fully 
acquainted as to the choice cuts of each kind of joint. 

518. To Carve Fish. — A silver slice should be used 



572 



RECHERCHE COOKERY. 



for this purpose. Great care must be taken in serving 
out fish to prevent breaking the flakes, which ought to 
be kept as entire as possible. Short-grained fish, such as 
sahnon, Sec, should be cut lengthwise, not crosswise. 

519. To Carve Sirloin of Beef. — A sirloin should be 
cut into thin slices, with a sharp firm cut from end to 
end of the joint. At the upper portion the cut should 
be clean and even, then use the point of the knife to 
loosen the slices from the bones. In carving the under- 
cut remove the superfluous fat, and cut the slices from 
end to end in the same manner as the upper portion. 

520. Neck of Veal or Mutton. — See that the neck is 
properly jointed before it is cooked. Cut the joint 
diagonally from the left-hand side into slices of mode- 
rate thickness. 

HOW TO CARVE. 
2 




Neck of Veal. 



521. Loin of Veal.— Cut out the kidney, turn the 
joint over, and carve into slices of moderate thickness. 
Serve a slice of kidney and fat with each slice of meat, 
having first inquired of the guest if the former are 
desired. 

522. Shoulder of Mutton. — This joint is usually sent 
to table lying on the dish the reverse side to that which 
is shown in the illustration. It should then be turned 



BEMOVES AND EOASTS, WITH HINTS ON CARVING. 573 

over. Commence carving into slices, more in the shape 
of a wedge at the end. Serve a small sHce cut from 
the bladebone end to each guest. All slices should be 
cut through to the bone, as shown in the illustration. 
The under parts of a shoulder are considered the most 
delicate, but it is essential for the carver to consult those 
at table as to which portions they prefer. 




Shoulder of Mutton. 



523. Saddle of Venison, Iamb, or Mutton. — Com- 
mence to carve lengthwise at first on both sides of the 
spinal bone, after which cut crosswise downward, and 
detach from the bone. The slices should be cut as close 
to the bone as possible. Hold the fork firmly in the 
centre of the saddle. Large slices should be cut in two 
crosswise. The slices should be from h to J of an inch 
in thickness. 

524. To Carve a Leg of Mutton. — The simplest way 
to carve a leg of mutton is to take hold of the bone end 
with the left hand, to cut the portion marked a with a 
firm stroke of the knife : next make a sharp incision 
down to the bone at b. Cut slender slices from A to c, 



574 



PtECHERCHE COOKERY. 



then loosen the shoes from the bone ; then turn the leg 
and cut the under portion m the same manner. Another 




\ 

E D 

way is to reverse the leg, commencing to cut at d, pro- 
ceeding in a similar way as above described. 

525. To Caive a Turkey. — A turkey is usually large 
enough for a small company, so that the breast and 
wings generally suffice. The slices should be cut from 
each side of the breast alternately, beginning close to 
the wing. A little stuffing or a small piece of liver 
ought to be served to each guest. The manner of cut- 
tins: the slices is shown in the illustration. When it is

necessary for the legs to be carved, they should 
severed from the body and then cut into slices. 



be 



REMOVES AND ROASTS, WITH HINTS ON CARVING. 575 

526. To Carve a Calf's Head. — Begin by cutting 
long slices from end to end of the cheek; with each of 
these slices cut a thin slice of the end of the head or 
neck, and serve with a little sauce, gravy, or broth. 




Showing Manner of Carving (if served whole). 

The portion round th6 eyes sliould not be served. 
The palate is usually kept for a separate dish, but if 
the whole is required at one serving, a small slice 
thereof should be offered to each guest. The throat 
sweetbread is probably the most favourite part of the 
head; this will be found at the fleshy part of the neck. 
It is usual to cut a small slice thereof for those who 
have a preference for it. When the jaw-bones are 
removed, you will meet with a delicately flavoured lean 
which will be very acceptable to those who do not care 
for the gelatinous parts. 

527. Duck (Canard). — A young duck or duckhng is 
carved very much the same as a fowl. First cut off 
the wing portions. The first slices of the breast should 
be cut close to the wing, proceeding upwards to the 
centre of the breast (breast-bone). The legs are next 
removed and cut in two at the joints. If stuffed, an 
opening should be made at the end portion of the duck, 



576 



RECHEKCHE COOKERY 



and tlie stuffing scooped out with a spoon, allowing a 
small portion to each guest. 

A laro-e duck is carved in the same way as a goose. 




Showing Manner of Carving. 

528. Goose (Oie). — Stick the fork into the centre of 
the breast, hold firmly, and commence to carve slices 
from the neck down the breast, as sho^vn in the illus- 




tration. Remove the wings and leg bones, and com- 
mence carving the remainder of the goose, leaving 
nothing but the carcase. 

529. Partridges, Woodcocks, &c. — Put the fork into 
the breast, cut a slice from the outside of the breast, 
then cut close along the breast -bone, severing the 
wings and legs from the carcase. The favourite parts 
of a partridge are the wings, breast, and the so-called 
merrythought.

MANNER OF JOINTING. 




Woodcock. 



Snipe. 




530. Chicken, Capon, or Poularde. — Stick the 
carving-fork into the leg, hold firmly clown on the 
dish, lift it up and loosen with the knife, cutting 
through the joint at the back. Divide it in two at 
the second joint. Then cut off the wings, and lastly 
the breast, each being cut in half crosswise. 

Some people prefer to lay the bird on its side and 
then proceed to carve in the same manner as above 
described.

DEESSED VEGETABLES AKD SALADS, 

Suitable as Second Course, Savoury Dishes, etc.. 

(See also pages 284-288.) 

531. Souffles de Pommes de Terre a la St. Louis. — 
8 kidney potatoes (not too large and of even size), 1 oz. 
of butter, J gill of cream or milk (about), 2 whites of" 
eggs, ^ oz. grated Cheddar cheese, salt and pejpper. 

Wash and scrub the potatoes with a brush ; when 
thoroughly clean, dry them on a cloth, put them in a 
moderately heated oven, and bake until done. Make 
an incision with a round cutter or knife at the ends, 
and scoop out the contents by means of a teaspoon, 
taking care not to break the skins. Rub the soft parts 
thus removed through a wire sieve, put it in a basin, 
work in the butter whilst warm, heat up the cream or 
milk, and add likewise ; beat up well with a wooden 
spoon, season with salt and pepper, and mix in the 
cheese. Beat the white of egg to a stiff froth, and 
mix carefully with the puree. Fill the potatoes with 
this preparation, stand them on a gratin dish or greased 
baking- sheet with a little puree, so as to make them 
stand firmly, bake in a quick oven for about ten minutes,. 
and serve as soon as done. 

532. Pommes de Terre a la Paysanne. — 8 cold 
potatoes (boiled), ^ pint of bechamel sauce, f gill of 
cream, 2 oz. of butter, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley,. 
J teaspoonful chopped chives, salt, pepper, and grated 
nutmeg. 

Cut the potatoes into squares, put them in a small 
stewpan, with a little water, on the fire ; when hot^ 

37 



580 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

strain off tlie water ; season with salt, pepper, and a 
pinch of grated nutmeg ; put in the sauce and cream ; 
let simmer gently for about ten minutes. Melt the 
butter in a frying-pan ; add the parsley and chives ; 
fry a little, and mingle gently with the potatoes. Pile 
up on a hot dish, and serve. 

Note. — The reason wdiy cold boiled potatoes are 
recommended for this dish is because fresh hot-boiled 
potatoes are apt to go to pieces and get pulpy during 
the process of this preparation. 

533. Pommes de Terre a la Chancerelle. — Wash 
and peel 8 to 10 large kidney potatoes, scoop out by 
means of a vegetable scoop as many balls as possible. 
€ook them gently in salted water, drain, and place 
in a stewpan, add J oz. of butter and about a gill of 
bechamel sauce, shake over the fire until hot, dish up 
in the form of a x^yramid. Sprinkle over with dissolved 
£sh glaze, and serve. 

534. Pommes de Terre a la Gastronome. — 12 
medium- sized potatoes, 2 truffles, ^ glass sherry, ^ pint 
Espagnole sauce, salt and pepper. 

Wash and peel the potatoes, cut them in halves 
lengthwise, stamp out with a tube cutter as many 
round tubes as possible, put them in a stewpan, cover 
well wdth w^arm water, add a pinch of salt, and cook 
for about twenty minutes, taking care that the potato 
shapes do not boil too fast, otherwise they will break 
and look unsightly. When done, strain them, and put 
in a hot dish. In the meantime chop the truffles 
finely, put them in a smaU stew-pan with the sherry, 
and cook for five minutes ; then add the sauce, let it 
reduce slowly, season wdth pepper and salt, if needed. 
Pour the sauce over the potatoes, and serve. 

535. Pommes de Terre a la Bignon. — 12 small 
round potatoes, J lb. raw mutton, 2 oz. fat pork, 1 yolk 
of egg, 1| oz. butter, salt, pepper, nutmeg. 

Cut up the mutton and pork into small pieces, 
season with pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg. Chop 
until very fine, or pass twice through a mincing 



DBESSED VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 581 

machine, and mix with the yolk of an egg. Choose 
the potatoes of even size, wash them well, and peel 
thinly. Scoop out part of the inside by means of a 
vegetable scoop, leaving the bottom uncut. Blanch 
them in boiling water for two minutes, drain and fill 
well with the above described sausage-meat, and close 
the openings with a piece of potato. Melt the butter 
in a saute-pan ; when hot, lay in the stuffed potatoes, 
and bake in the oven for twenty minutes. Baste well 
with the butter, dish up, sprinkle with a little finely 
chopped parsley, and serve, or use as a garnish for 
Releves or Entrees. 

536. Pommes Frites a la Julienne. — Wash and peel 
some potatoes ; cut them into small shreds, similar to 
julienne roots ; wash well and dry on a cloth ; throw 
them, a few at a time, into plenty of clear boiliAg- fat ; 
shake the potatoes about in the fat until they are 
crisp and of a deep yellow colour. Drain on a cloth, 
sprinkle slightly with salt, and serve on a folded 
napkin. In order to move the potatoes well in the 
fat so that they may be equal in colour, it is best 
to use a frying-basket, in which the potatoes are placed 
for frying. 

537. Pommes Soufflees. — Wash and peel 6 to 8 
good medium -sized mealy potatoes, cut them into 
slices (lengthwise), a quarter of an inch thick. 

Plunge them into a friture of moderately heated 
fat for about six minutes, lift out, let cool a few 
moments. Let the fat get quite hot, plunge in the 
potatoes, move the basket about ; the potatoes should 
then swell. Drain, season with fine salt, dish on a 
folded napkin. 

538. Pommes Pailles. — Peel 6 medium - sized 
potatoes, cut them into thin slices, cut these into 
fine shreds about li in. long. 

Wash well and drain on a cloth. Have ready some 
hot fat, sufficient to well cover the quantity of potatoes, 
put the potatoes into the fat when very hot, and fry 
for about six minutes. Take out, drain well sprinkle 



582 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

with a little fine salt, shake them lightly, and dish 
up on a folded napkin or dish-paper. 

539. Pommes de Terre a la Duchesse. — Wash and 
peel about two pounds of mealy potatoes, boil until 
done, drain off the water, and let them dry in the 
oven for a few minutes, covered over ; rub them quickly 
through a wire sieve ; whilst warm, mix with three 
yolks of eggs, two ounces of clarified butter, and a 
tablespoonful of cream, season with pepper, salt, and 
grated nutmeg ; when well mixed, turn out on a floured 
board, and make twelve parts of equal size ; give each 
the shape of a square, trace a few lines with a knife, 
lay them on a buttered baking- sheet, egg the surface, 
bake them in a quick oven, and dish up. 

640. Pommes Nouvelles Sautees au Beurre. — Peel 
or scrape 12 to 18 new round or kidney potatoes (small 
and even size). 

Melt 2 oz. butter in a saute-pan; when clarified, 
add the ]Dotatoes, cook over a moderate fire or in the 
oven ; they will take about twenty minutes, and should 
be of a rich golden colour when done. Season with 
salt, sprinkle with a little freshly- chopped parsley, dish 
up, and serve. 

541. Pommes Sautees a la Suisse. — Slice as thinly 
as possible about 8 cold potatoes of medium size. Melt 
1 oz. butter in a frying or omelet-pan, put in the 
potatoes, season with pepper and salt. 

Cook over a quick fire for five minutes, toss very 
frequently ; put them on one side of the pan, so as to 
give it the shape of an omelet. Allow them to colour 
nicely, then tuin out on a hot dish, and serve. 

542. Pommes Sautees a la Parisienne. — Choose 
8 medium-sized cold boiled potatoes, cut them into 
slices about a quarter of an inch thick. Put about 
1| oz. butter in a saute-pan; when hot, put in the 
slices of potatoes, season with pepper and salt, and toss 
over a bright fire until of a golden colour. Dish up, 
sprinkle with a little chopped parsley, and serve. 

543. Pommes Hachies au Gratin. — Cut 8 cold 



DRESSED VEGETABLES AND SALADS. 583 

boiled potatoes into small squares, put them in a sauce- 
pan containing i gill cream and J oz. butter, pre- 
viously warmed, add salt and pepper, and 1 table- 
spoonful grated cheese, heat up. 

Butter a gratin-disli, sprinkle with grated cheese, 
strew the potatoes on this, sprinkle well with grated 
cheese and breadcrumbs, place a small piece of butter 
here and there, and bake in a quick oven ; bake a nice 
light brown, and serve. 

544. Pommes Chateau. — Peel 12 medium -sized 
potatoes, cut them into quarters, round off the sharp 
edges, blanch in salted water, and drain. Put 2 oz. 
clarified butter in a saute-pan; when hot, place in the 
potatoes, toss them over the fire for a few minutes, 
then put in the oven, and bake for twenty minutes. 
When finished, they should be crisp and of a nice 
golden colour. Drain on a cloth or paper, sprinkle 
with a little chopped parsley and salt, dish up in a 
pile, and serve hot. 

545. Pommes Parisienne. — These are prepared in 
the same manner as " Pommes Chateau," the potatoes 
being scooped out in little round balls, by means of a 
vegetable cutter, or scoop. In blanching, great care 
must be taken; they should be brought to the boil 
quickly, else they will be in pieces by the time they 
are cooked. Ten minutes is ample for baking. They 
are mostly served as a garnish with fillets of beef, 
steaks, or tournedos. 

546. Pommes Nouvelles a la Hollandaise. — Wash, 
scrape, and boil about two dozen or more even-sized 
new potatoes ; drain, dry, and put them into a vegetable 
dish. Melt two ounces of butter in a stewpan ; add a 
tablespoonful of bechamel sauce. Work up well ; mix 
with one yolk of egg the juice of half a lemon ; season 
with a little white pepper, grated nutmeg, and salt ; 
stir a little longer over the fire, but do not let it boil. 
Pour over the potatoes, and serve. 

547- Pommes de Terra aux Tomates a la Savarin. — 
8 small even-sized potatoes, 4 firm tomatoes, 1 onion, 



584 KECHERCHE COOKERY. 

1 oz. Parmesan cheese, 2 egg yolks, ^ oz. breadcrumbs, 
1 oz. butter, 1 oz. chopped ham, salt and pepper, 2 
slices of toasted bread. 

Peel the potatoes, cut off the ends of each, scoop 
out by means of a column cutter the centre of each 
potato, fry in hot fat a golden colour, and drain. 
Put the butter in a small stewpan ; when hot, put in 
the onion, finely chopped, cook just for a minute over 
the fire, then add the Parmesan cheese, finely grated, 
and the breadcrumbs, stir for two minutes, remove 
from the fire, add the yolks of eggs, and a pinch of 
salt and pepper. Cut the tomatoes in two crossways, 
squeeze out gently a little of the juice, chop up the 
ham finely, sprinkle over the cut halves of tomatoes, 
fill the centre of the potatoes with the prepared stuffing, 
place one in the centre of each tomato. Brush over 
with a little oiled butter, stand them in a buttered 
baking-tin or saute-pan, cover over with a piece of 
buttered paper, and bake in a hot oven for ten minutes ; 
dish up on rounds of freshly toasted bread, and serve. 

548. Croquettes de Pommes de Terre a la Moderae. — 
Wash and peel about 2 lbs. of potatoes, cook them in 
the ordinary way, drain and dry well, and rub through 
a sieve.

a stewpan with boiling water and beat vigorously with 
a whisk for about twenty minutes. Butter and flour a 
large saute-pan or deep square baking-sheet. When 
the mixture is sufficiently worked, stir in by degrees the 
sifted flour, the sifted ground almonds, and the butter 
(melted); mix carefully but well; pour into the tin 
and bake in a moderately-heated oven from twenty-five 
to thirty minutes. When cold, cut out as many rounds 
as are required, but each one must be smaller than the 
other. Stamp out the centre of each round thus obtained 
to form rings about an inch or one and a half inch 
broad, leaving the largest and the smallest ones whole. 
The largest will form the bottom and the smallest the 
top of the " Gateau." Have some apricot jam made 
liquid, place the large round on a dish, spread the tops and 



COLD SWEETS AND ICES. 635 

bottoms of the rings with apricot jam and fasten them 
together, commencing with the largest so as to form a 
pyramid. Allow the gateau to set and coat the outside 
with chocolate icing. Ornament with royal icing to taste. 
Do not fasten the top piece. Fill the cornets with a 
previously prepared custard (creme patissiere), sprinkle 
the tops with chopped pistachio kernels, fasten them 
by means of a little icing in a row round the gateau. 
When the dish is wanted for table, remove the top piece 
and fill with well-frozen strawberry ice cream ; replace 
the top, and serve. The chocolate icing can be substi- 
tuted with strawberry fondant or orange fondant

stamp out some very thin circles about two and a half 
inches in diameter. Wrap each quickly round an oiled 
cornet mould, put in a second mould so as to keep in 
shape. Remove when cool ; whip the cream, sweeten 
with a little vanilla sugar ; fill the cornets with this, 
sprinkle with a few chopped pistachio kernels, and serve. 
The edges of the cornets look better if garnished with 
little beads of royal icing. These cornets can also be 
filled with ice cream or any kind of sweet custard, and 
will thus make a pleasant change.

above the edge of the mould, and bake in a very slow 
oven for about half an hour. When done, turn out on 
a sieve to get cool. When ready for serving, whisk a 
half-pint or more of double cream. Sweeten slightly 
with vanilla sugar ; dish up the hordure on a round 
dish ; dress the cream in the centre, and serve. 

672. Cotelettes en Surprise. — Roll and stamp out on 
a floured board twelve thin heart -shapes of feuilletage 
paste, put a teaspoonful of apricot marmalade on one 
side of each, and about half a teaspoonful of soft almond 
paste on top ; wet the edges, fold over, press down the 
edges well, and give them the shape of cutlets as near 
as possible ; put them on a baking- sheet and bake ; 
when cold, baste the cakes with dissolved apricot 
marmalade, and roll them in crushed macaroons ; have 
ready some short pieces of baked almond paste, insert 
one in the small end of each to imitate bones ; make a 
skewer red hot to imitate the gridn-on marks. Dish up 
the cakes in a circular form on a thin layer of apricot 
marmalade ; pour some melted red-currant jelly when 
nearly cold in the centre, and serve. This is a very 
efifective dish, but needs some practice in the shaping of 
cutlets. 

673. Napolitaines a la Suisse. — \ lb. castor sugar, 
4 eggs, I lb. butter, 1 gill of milk, pinch of carbonate of 
soda, a little pounded nutmeg,! teaspoonful chopped lemon

trimmings, macaroon or almond paste, greengage and 
apricot jam, 1 tablespoonful ground chocolate, a few 
drops of liquid carmine. 

Cream the butter and sugar well, add the eggs one 
at a time ; when nicely creamed, add the nutmeg, lemon 
rind, carbonate, and flour ; mix the whole well. Divide 
the mixture into three portions, and colour two portions 
respectively, one pink with carmine, and the other 
brown with the ground chocolate. Spread the three 
lots separately on a paper-lined baking-sheet, about 
half-an-inch in thickness, and bake in a slow oven,

without letting it take colour ; when done, turn out and 
let cool. Roll out into a square strip about J lb. of 
puff-paste, one-eighth of an inch thick, place on a 
baking -sheet, prick it here and there to prevent it from 
bhstering, and bake in a hot oven ; when done, cut it 
in half, and spread over with dissolved apricot jam. 
Cut the previously baked mixture into strips the width 
of the puft'-paste ; lay them alternately across one- 
half of the puff-paste until the whole of the jam is 
covered. Roll out some almond paste, and put a thin 
layer over the strips, spread over with greengage jam, 
repeat the layers of strips as before, taking care that the 
strips laid over are of a different colour to those first 
placed, so that if the first is pink, the next should be 
brown, and if yellow, the next should be pink or brown, 
and so on. Cover over with a thm layer of apricot jam, 
and, last of all, another layer of almond paste ; now put 
the other half of puff-paste on top, so as to cover the 
whole, press it between two boards, and place some 
weights on top ; let it remain thus for about two hours. 
Remove weight and board, spread a layer of meringuage 
over the surface, sprinkle with shredded almonds, place 
the cake in the oven long enough to set the meringue 
mixture, and cut into convenient pieces.

increasing the speed until it becomes a hard froth. 
Mix in quickly, but sparingly at first, the castor sugar 
and one dessert -spoonful of vanilla sugar. Have ready 
a large baking-sheet lined with foolscap paper. Put the 
mixture into two large paper cornets or a forcing-bag (not 
quite full). If paper cornets are used, cut off the point 
ends, close the large end, and press out on to the baking- 
sheet some evenly-sized egg-shapes ; dust with sugar, 
and bake in a very slack oven from twenty to twenty-five

cream the butter with the sugar, add the whole egg, 
and work until thoroughly incorporated ; now add the 
pounded almonds and work until smooth. EoU out 
the pufl'-paste, stamp out some rounds about 3^ inches 
in diameter ; stamp out rings of paste J of an mch 
wide and fix on the rounds to form the border, and fill 
with the mixture ; place a few strips of paste crossways, 
bake in a moderate oven ; when nearly done dust with 
sugar and finish baking. 

767. Dartois aux Abricots Meringue. — Roll out 
some puft'-paste about three inches wide, trim off the 
edges, place it on a baking-sheet, and bake for ten 
minutes. 

Spread with warm a.pricot marmalade ; have ready a 
meringue mixture, put it in a forcmg-bag with a plain 
tube, put it m the shape of ribbons across the layer of 
marmalade, so as to form a lattice-work pattern. Dredge 
with sugar, place halves of glace cherry and small 
pieces of angelique alternately in the centre of the 
patterns. Bake m a cool oven for ten minutes just 
long enough to dry, cut into convenient finger shapes,

PASTRIES (various), CAKES, TARTLETS, &C. 681 

put in the salt, yeast, and the milk (made tepid), and 
work it into a smooth dough ; knead well, put it in a basin, 
and let stand to rise in a warm closet for about half-an- 
hour. Put the butter in the remainder of the flour, add 
the sugar, a tablespoonful of warm water, and mix 
thoroughly with 3 eggs. Knead well, add 2 more eggs, 
work again, and then add 2 more ; beat well for ten 
minutes, or longer, until a smooth batter is obtained. 
When the sponge or dough has sufficiently risen, mix 
it with the batter, knead it thoroughly, put it in a 
floured basin, and let it stand in a warm place for two 
hours ; the paste should rise to twice the original size. 
Take about a sixth part of the paste for forming the 
heads ; divide this into 10 or 12 pieces, and form into 
balls, flatten them, make a hole in the centre, place 
them on a buttered baking-tin, roll the remaining 
paste into little balls, and place one in the centre of 
each, fixing with a little water. Stand them in a warm 
place to prove ; brush over with beaten egg, and bake 
in a moderately heated oven. They will take rather 
more than half-an-hour. Dust with vanilla sugar, and 
serve cold. 

An excellent brioche paste can be made by using ^ lb. 
of ordinary flour and ^ lb. of Coombs' self-raising flour, 
in place of the pound of flour given in this recipe ; the 
use of yeast is then dispensed with. 

769. Gateaux Mille-feuilles. — | lb. puff-paste, 2 table- 
spoonfuls red-currant jelly, 2 tablespoonfuls apricot 
marmalade, 2 tablespoonfuls raspberry jam, 2 table-

sugar, 2 oz. chopped pistachio kernels. 

Give the puff-paste five turns, cut it into five parts, 
one part being somewhat thicker than the four others. 
Roll out the four to a thickness of about |- inch, and 
place them on a baking- sheet separately. Roll out the 
thicker part about ^ inch in thickness, and place on a 
baking- sheet. Bake all five in a moderate oven for 
about thirty minutes ; glaze the thickest part with sugar 
to form the cover. When sufficiently cool, spread over 



682 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

each surface of the four thinnest parts separately with 
the marmalade and jam ; place one on top of the other, 
cover with tlie thickest part, mask the cover with fondant 
sugar, sprinkle with chopped pistachio kernels. Cut the 
sides even with a sharp knife, ornament the top with 
various coloured marmalades and jam. Serve it whole, 
or cut into even-sized slices. This gateau may be made 
in round or oblong shape ; the edges should in either 
case be cut, when finished, for serving. 

770. Gateau a la Beatrice. — | lb. castor sugar, 8 eggs, 
^ gill Maraschino, 2 oz. ground almonds, 6 oz. butter, 
1 glass Kirsch, J lb. ground rice, 3 tablespoonfuls apricot 
jam, 1 tablespoonful red-currant jelly, a few pistachios 
or almonds. 

Put the sugar in a copper egg-bowl, break the eggs, 
add, and beat over a very slow fire for fifteen to twenty 
minutes ; then add the almonds, the ground rice, the 
butter (slightly warmed), and the liqueur ; mix the 
whole gently. Butter and flour a round pudding -mould, 
fill in the mixture, and bake in a moderate oven for 
thirty to thirty-five minutes. When done, turn out of 
the mould and glaze over whilst warm with some apricot 
jam, previously reduced with a little syrup and strained. 
When the coating is set, put some red-currant jelly into 
a paper cornet, cut the point, and ornament the top in 
shape of a crown and a B underneath. Garnish with 
a few peeled pistachios, and serve on a round dish with 
lace paper. 

771. Gateau a la Portugaise. — ^ lb. almonds (peeled), 
1^ orange, j lb. castor sugar, 3 whole eggs, 1 oz. fecule, 
glace royale, crystallised cherries, and angelique. 

Cream the sugar and yolks of eggs in a basin, pound 
the almonds in a mortar, incorporate the juice of oranges 
and peelings finely chopped. Work well in the mortar 
for a few minutes ; work this mixture in with the sugar 
and yolks of eggs, and add the fecule. Beat the whites 
of eggs to a stiff froth, and mix gently with the mixture, 
and fill into an oblong mould well buttered ; bake in a 
moderate oven for half-an-hour or more. Turn out on 



PASTRIES (various), CAKES, TARTLETS, &C. 683 

a sieve to cool, glaze neatly with a coating of glace 
royale, ornament with crystallised cherries and angelique. 
Serve whole or cut into slices. 

772. Tranches a la Neige. — | lb. butter, ^ lb. castor 
sugar, ^ lb. flour, 2 oz. icing sugar, 2 oz. ground almonds, 
J rind lemon peel, 4 yolks of eggs, 6 whites of eggs. 

Work the butter with the egg-yolks and castor sugar; 
add the flour, beat up 4 whites of eggs, and mix gently 
with the mixture ; bake in a flat oblong buttered tin, 
ivhisk the 2 remaining whites of eggs to a stiff froth, mix 
with them sugar, ground almonds, and lemon peel. 
Spread over the surface thickly, cut in convenient slices. 
Shape neatly, and bake quickly a light yellow. Dust 
with sugar before baking. Fruit jam can be spread 
thinly over the cake before the snow is added. 

773. Meringues (Shells). — J lb. sifted sugar, 6 whites 
of eggs. 

Whisk the whites of eggs in an egg-bowl until they 
represent a stiff froth ; mix them with the sugar lightly ; 
be careful not to work the batter too much in mixing, 
otherwise the froth will become too soft for shap- 
ing. The preparation is then ready for moulding the 
•desired shapes of meringues ; this may be eflected with 
a spoon, with a cornet, or piping-bag. Place some 
foolscap paper on a baking sheet, or on a board about 
J of an inch thick, shape the meringues on it in rows, 
keep them about an inch apart from each other, dust 
them with sifted sugar, place them in a very moderate 
oven for about 2 hours. When done, take u]3 each 
meringue, break in the bottom carefully with your 
thumb, put back on the baking-sheet, and allow them 
to dry overnight in a warm place. 

774. Meringues au Citron. — Proceed as before ; add 
the rind of half a lemon finely chopped, and mixed with 
the sugar ; when baked and cool, fill with whipped 
cream slightly sweetened.

adding ^ lb. peeled, dried, and pounded almonds along 
with the suga,r, and proceed as previously described. 



684 KECHERCHE COOKERY. 

776. Mering^ues aux Pistaches. — J lb. pistachio 
kernels, peeled, dried, and pounded with 2 whites of eggs ; 
make a stiff froth of 5 whites of eggs, and mix with 
J lb. sugar ; whisk all over the fire until it becomes luke- 
warm, take oft' and whisk until it becomes cold, then add 
the pistachios, and mix carefully. Shape the meringues 
and bake. If liked, 2 oz. ground almonds and 2 oz. pis- 
tachios may be used in place of the 4 oz. of pistachios. 

777. Genoise Paste. — 5 whole eggs, 4 oz. sifted 
sugar, 3 oz. flour, dried and sifted, 2 oz. warmed 
butter. 

Separate the whites of eggs from the yolks, place 
the whites in a copper egg-bowl and the yolks in a 
round basin ; to the latter add the sugar, and work them 
well with a wooden spoon for about five minutes. Beat 
the whites to a stiff froth, mix the flour and butter, and 
whisk lightly with the yolks, to incorporate the ingredi- 
ents ; the mixture will then be ready for pouring into 
buttered and floured tins, sheets, fancy moulds, &c. 

Note. — In making Genoise Paste, the quantity of 
eggs used should always represent two parts in weight 
to one of either, so that an ounce of butter, an egg, and 
an ounce of flour added extra to the above quantities 
will not matter much. 

778. Genoise au Chocolat.— Prepare the same mix- 
ture as given for plain Genoise, but incorporate with 
the yolks and sugar 2 oz. ground almonds and 1 oz. 
grated chocolate. 

779. Genoise au Cafe. — Add a dessert-spoonful of best 
coffee extract, with the yolks of eggs and sugar, and 
prepare the same mixture with the given ingredients as 
for Genoise. 

780. Genoise decoree. — Prepare the Genoise mixture 
(any flavour), and put into a square baking- sheet ; if you 
do not have one with the sides turned up all round, 
fasten a piece of wood across the part which is open, to 
keep the mixture from running oft'. Bake it in a quick 
oven to a nice yellow colour, cut it into fancy or plain 
shapes, put them to dry, then glaze them with different 



PASTRIES (various), CAKES, TARTLETS, &C. 685- 

coloured fondant or glace royale ; when dry, ornament 
with apple and red-currant jelly. 

781. Dominos. — Genoese pastry, | lb. icing sugar,. 
X white of egg, apricot marmalade, desiccated cocoanut 
or almonds, brown vegetable colouring. 

Cut the pastry into shapes of dominos, coat the sides 
with a thin layer of marmalade, and dip into finely 
chopped desiccated cocoanut or almonds. Prepare 
some royal icing with the white of egg and sugar, and 
coat the top of each domino with this. Put them aside, 
to set. Add sufficient brown colouring to the remainder 
of the icing, put it in a forcing-bag or paper cornet. 
Mark out a thin line to divide each domino, and force 
out little dots to make them resemble dominos. 

782. Biscuits de Bordeaux.— 2 oz. butter, 2 oz. 
castor sugar, 8 oz. flour, 1 egg, 1 teaspoonful orange 
juice, 1 small glass old port wine, a pinch of salt,

wide, place them on a floured baking-sheet, prick them 
over with a fork, and bake in a well-heated oven. 

783. Biscuits au Cognac. — | lb. flour, 3 whites of 
eggs, i gill cream, ^ gill brandy, li oz. castor sugar, a 
pinch of salt, 1 tablespoonful milk. 

Sift the flour on to a board, add the salt and sugar ; 
mix a tablespoonful of milk with the whites of eggs, 
and pour into a well in the centre of the flour, together 
with the brandy and cream. Work the whole into a 
smooth paste, and roll out very thin on a floured board. 
Stamp out some rounds with a tin cutter, prick them 
over with a fork, and bake on a floured sheet in a quick 
oven. 

784. Opera Biscuits. — 6 oz. Coombs' self-raising 
flour, 6 oz. castor sugar, 4 oz. ground almonds, 4 oz. 
glace cherries, 1 oz. pistachio kernels. 5 eggs, 8 drops,

686 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

Put the sugar into a basin, add the eggs one at a 
time, and work to a hght cream. Sift the flour, and 
work in Hghtly. Blanch the pistachios, peel, and chop 
small ; cut the cherries into small pieces, and add both 
to the mixture, together with the almonds and vanilla 
essence. Put the mixture into a forcing-bag, with a 
large plain tube. Squeeze out some drops on to a 
greased tin about the size of a halfpenny-piece ; dust 
over with fine sugar, and bake in a moderately-heated 
oven. When done, remove from the tin on to a sieve, 
and serve when cold. 

785. Cocoanut Biscuits. — i lb. cocoanut (desiccated

mix the sugar, cocoanut, and flour. Stir into the whites, 
mix carefully with a w^ooden spoon. Drop the mixture 
in little heaps, about ^ inch apart, on wafer or rice 
paper laid on to a baking- sheet. Bake in a very slow 
oven. This mixture may now be laid out for baking by 
means of a biscuit or forcing-bag, but where only a 
small quantity is required, this mode of dressing is not 
advisable. 

786. Biscuits a I'Africaine. — 4 oz. castor sugar, 
4 oz. flour, 4 oz. butter, 2 oz. Brown & Poison's cornflour, 
3 eggs, 3 oz. desiccated cocoanut, a little milk.

them into shreds, and dry in the oven. Mix about a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice and the shredded almonds 
with the dough. Drop the mixture in little heaps 
about 1^ inches apart from each other on to a well- 
buttered baking-tin, dust over with a little castor sugar, 
and bake in a moderately-heated oven from 15 to 20 
minutes. 

788. Biscuit a la Cuillere. — 8 eggs, i lb. castor 
sugar, 6 oz. flour, sifted (or 4 oz. fecule). 

Separate the yolks from the whites of eggs. Put the 
yolks in a basin with the sugar, and stir with a wooden 
spoon or spatula until quite smooth and creamy. Whisk 
the whites of eggs to a stiff froth (add a pinch of salt 
before beginning to whisk). Work the flour and whites 
of eggs in small quantities into the creamed yolks (if the 
eggs are small it will not require more than 5 oz. flour). 
Fill a forcing-bag three-parts full with the mixture, and 
with a plain pipe (^-inch) press out the paste on to a 
baking- sheet, covered with white paper, in the shape of 
fingers about 3 inches long ; keep them about an inch 
apart. Proceed thus until the mixture is used up. 
Dust over with castor sugar. Bake in a moderately- 
heated oven a golden colour. Let them cool on the

off the crust, cut into fancy shapes, round, diamond, or 



688 RECHERCHE COOKERY. 

half-moons. Put the milk in a stewpan, add the vanilla, 
sweeten to taste, and boil up. When nearly cold, 
pour over the pieces of bread and let them soak. Beat 
up two whites and one yolk of eggs, add a pinch of salt, 
immerse the pieces of bread and fry in hot butter or 
lard to a light colour, drain on paper or cloth, sprinkle 
w^ith castor sugar in which the ground cinnamon has 
been amalgamated. Dish up in a pile and serve vnih 
a boat of custard, made with the remaining yolk of egg, 
the milk, and a teaspoonful of cornflour. 

790. Pulled Bread. — Procure a few French rolls,

the yolks of eggs with the fecule, pour gradually the hot 
milk on to this, and stir over a slow fire until it begins 
to thicken. Dissolve the gelatine and mix with the 
above, strain through a fine sieve, let cool, and use as 
directed. 

792. Feuilletage (Puff-paste). —1 lb. flour, ^ oz. 
salt, 1 lb. butter, about ^ pint water, 1 teaspoonful 
lemon juice. 

Sift the flour on to the pastry slab, add the salt, 
make a well in the centre, put in sufficient cold v^^ater 
and the lemon juice to form a smooth paste, working 
in at the same time a little butter about the size of a- 
walnut. Knead the paste as little as possible, and allow 
it to stand for a few minutes before working in the 
remainder of the butter. 

Wash the butter in iced water, knead it in a wet 
cloth, and shape into a flat square. Pioll out the paste 
into a square about twice the size of the butter ; the 
sides of the paste should be rolled somewhat thinner 



PASTRIES (various), CAKES, TARTLETS, &C. 689 

than the centre. Put the butter in the centre of the 
paste, fold in the four sides, so as to completely 
envelope the butter. Roll out very gently and in one 
direction only, and fold in three ; this is called the 
first turn. Keep the paste in a cool place and repeat 
rolling and folding it as before three or four times, 
allowing the paste to cool for at least 10 minutes 
between each turn. The paste is then ready for 
use. 

793. Pate Nouille (Nouille Paste). — Proceed the 
same as described in No. 126, omitting the grated 
cheese.

Pound almonds and sugar in a mortar ; add the 
whites of eggs one at a time ; pound well so as to 
thoroughly mix it ; last of all, add the essence, and use 
as required. If placed in a jar and covered it will keep 
good for some time. 

797. Pate d'Amandes (Almond Paste). — 1^ lb. lump 
sugar, saffron, 1 gill water, 3 drops almond essence, 
I lb. ground almonds, 1 egg. 

Put sugar and water in a copper pan ; when dissolved

place on the fire and let boil to the small blow degree ; add 
the almonds and essence, also saftron to give it a yellow 
tint ; tm'n on a slab and work in one whole egg ; work 
to a soft paste. 

798. Pate a la Madeleine.— 1 lb. flour, | lb. butter, 
1 lb. castor sugar, 1 teaspoonful orange-flower water, 
the juice and rind of | a lemon, 6 eggs. 

Sift the flour and put it with the sugar and butter 
(previously oiled) in a stewpan ; add the orange-flower 
water, lemon juice, and the lemon rind finely chopped. 
Work in the yolks of eggs ; beat the whites to snow and 
incorporate with the mixture. 

799. Pate a la Duchesse. — 1 pint cream, 2 oz. 
castor sugar, ^ lb. butter, 1 teaspoonful orange-flower 
water, a pinch of salt, flour, 2 or 3 eggs. 

Put the cream, sugar, butter, orange-flower water, 
and salt in a stewpan and when on boiling-point stir in 
enough sifted flour to form a dry paste, and work over 
the fire till the flour is cooked. When a little cool, add 
two or three eggs. 

800. Glace Royale. — Put a white of egg into a basin, 
stir with a wooden spoon, and add gradually about a 
quarter of a pound of fine icing sugar ; work it 
thoroughly, adding a few drops of lemon juice at the 
last. It must be worked until the whole presents 
a thick and yet a liquid shiny substance, which 
must be perfectly white. To ice a cake, the surface of 
the same, should be masked with the glace about a 
quarter of an inch thick. It should not be decorated 
until the coating is perfectly set, which is best 
effected by placing the cake for a few minutes in a 
cool oven, keeping the cake covered with a piece of 
paper. 

801. Icing : Petits Fours, Gateaux, and Small Pastry. 
— Fondant tor Masking Cakes and Gateaux. — 1| lb. 
lump sugar, a good pinch of cream of tartar, about a gill 
of boiling water. 

Put the sugar into a copper stewpan, add the pinch 
of cream of tartar, pour the water (boiling) over, and 



PASTRIES (various), CAKES, TARTLETS, ETC. 691 

let stand on the stove until the sugar is quite dissolved. 
Set it over a quick fire and allow it to boil up quickly for 
a few minutes. The best way to find out when the 
sugar has boiled sufficiently is to try the heat with a 
thermometer, which should register 240 degrees for 
fondant sugar. Take it from the fire and rub the 
syrup with a wooden spoon against the sides for a 
minute or two. After it has stood to cool for a few 
minutes, sprinkle a few drops of cold water over the 
top and stir until it becomes a white or creamy 
substance. It is best to turn it into an earthenware 
basin as soon as it is done. It can be kept for a long 
time if covered over with a thick damp cloth, which 
should, of course, be changed and redamped from time 
to time. When required for use a quantity is put into 
a stewpan or basin and stood in hot water over the fire, 
and is worked until it is fit for glazing. A little 
water may be added if not soft enough. In order to 
know when the fondant is fit for use it should be just 
warm enough to bear the finger in it. Any flavouring 
can be added when melted ; use always the best 
quaUty. Chocolate flavour is added by grating a small 
quantity of unsweetened chocolate or cocoa powder, both 
of which should be previously melted before it is added. 
For coffee flavour use extract or essence of coffee. 

802. Glace Fondante au Cafe (Coffee Icing). — Put a 
pound of best icing sugar or very fine castor sugar 
in a copper pan, add about a gill of water and boil it 
to the small ball degree ; turn out into a basin, and 
work with a spatula until it becomes creamy ; flavour 
with a dessert- spoonful of best coffee essence. Dip in 
the surface of the gateaux and finish as directed. It 
is necessary to remember that if fondant icing is used 
too warm it will lose its briUiancy, and that it should 
be stirred until it has reached the desired consistency 
for icing — in other words, the icing point. 

803. Beurre au Cafe (Moka). — Coffee Butter for 
decorating Pastry and Cakes. — | lb. fresh butter, 4 oz. 
castor sugar, 1 yolk of egg, essence of coffee. 

44 



692 



RECHERCHE COOKERY. 



Cream the sugar and yolk of egg for about ten 
minutes ; add a few drops of coffee essence or very strong 
freshly-made coffee, so as to impart a flavour of coffee. 
Work in by degrees the butter, previously put in a warm 
place to make it soft. When sufficiently worked, put it 
on the ice for a few minutes, stir again, and use for 
garnish by means of a forcing-bag and fancy tube or 
a paper cornet, point cut according to requirement. 

804. Short Paste (Pate a foncer).— 1 lb. flour, 
^ lb. butter, a pinch of salt, about ^ pint water. 
Sift the flour, add the salt, rub in lightly the butter, 
moisten with sufficient water to make the paste, 
knead it until it forms a smooth paste. Let it rest in 
a cool place for about an hour before using it. 

For fruit pie-crust, tartlets, &c., add an ounce of 
castor sugar and two to three yolks of eggs, proceed- 
ing in the same manner, using enough water to work 
the ingredients into a smooth but not too firm a paste. 

805. Vanilla Sugar. — Split some vanilla pod, cut 
it up into small pieces, and pound in a mortar with 
a quantity of castor sugar (2 lb. of sugar to 1 oz. of 
vanilla) ; when fine, pass through a sieve, and keep 
in a well-closed tin or jar. 

806. Boiling Sugar to various degrees (La 
Cuisson du Sucre).

HOW TO PREPAKE A BILL OF FARE. 



To make a bill of fare with ease, 
And one that's always sure to please, 

Start " soup " as a beginner. 
Next in order comes the ** fish," 
Then some little dainty dish 
To take away the taste of fish, 

And pave the way for dinner. 
Then the *• joints" can be put in; 
Eoasts and boileds to choose between ; 
Two of each is right, I ween. 
Next come the " vegetables" — 
Not too many ; you can fix 
All the way from three to six 
Viand-groaning tables. 
Then the " entrees " find a place 
(All tid-bits and meant to brace 

A waning appetite) ; 
These should be not more than three, 
Made daintily so as to be 

The epicure's delight. 
Here a " punch" should come between, I reason, 
And game along with it (if in season). 
The " pie " and '< pudding," " fruit " and " cake," 
And last some " liquor." — Now, what '11 you take ? 

John Willy. 




MENUS 

AND THEIR COMPILATION, 



"Menu mal fait, diner perdu." — Bp.illat-Savaein. 

Although there is hardly a dmner served nowadays 
without each guest being provided with a sort of pro- 
gramme of the dinner — or, as it is called in English 
*' Bill of Fare " — our forefathers in the time of yore had 
no need for them ; they contented themselves by merely 
looking at the dishes as they came on the table to judge 
the nature of the \dands. 

The use of menus was first heard of in 1541, when, 
at a banquet given by the Duke Henry of Brunswick, 
his Grace was seen to have a long piece of paper by 
the side of his plate, to which he occasionally referred. 
One of the duke's guests asked what the paper was for, 
and on its being explained that it was a sort of pro- 
gramme of what they were going to eat, and by looking 
through it he could reserve his appetite for those dishes 
he Hked best, the idea was so much admired that it 
soon became generally known and adopted. The old- 
fashioned bills of fare were usually written on large 
cards gaudily ornamented with gastronomic symbols, 
&c. ; they were, however, of such a size that only one 
copy could be conveniently placed at each end of the 
table. 



706 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

The size of these cards was gradually dimmished, 
and, as they became smaller, larger numbers were 
placed at the table, so that at this time each guest is 
provided with a printed menu card. 

To set up a menu is an art, and, whatever may be 
said to the contrary, the style of it adds much to the 
popularity of a dinner. 

It gives one, as it were, a foretaste of the cliefs ability, 
and a confidence is consequently inspired. This is, no 
doubt, as important to a successful issue as is the faith 
in a doctor's nostrums. 

Modern menus, as a rule, are much prettier got up 
than those of olden times. In the matter of material for 
menus, white paper is mostly used, but more expensive 
material is much used also. I have seen some made 
of silk, papier-mache ; some in the form of shells, books, 
almanacks, cigars, cigarettes, matchboxes, newspapers, 
maps, post-cards, bank-notes, blank covers, envelopes, 
&c. Menus in the shape of envelopes are particularly 
pretty, and now very much in favour. One takes the 
form of a small, delicately-coloured envelope of thin 
cardboard, decorated with gold; the flap is engraved with 
a motto, crest, name of host or hostess, some flowers, 
or a knife and fork crossed and a sprig of herbs ; the 
post-mark is " Bon Appetit." On the address side is a 
stamp in gold, with some gastronomic design, and a 
post-mark bearing the name of the place where the 
meal is given, with the respective date and name of the 
diner. The enclosure is, of course, the menu itself. 

Hand-painted menus on paper, parchment, and satin 
are in great favour in all Society circles. Some of the 
newest have a miniature of the host or hostess painted 
in the centre, and are occasionally the work of noted 
artists. 



MENUS AND THEIR COMPILATION 707 

In England, America, and France mncli art and 
luxury have been lavished on menu cards. Parchment 
of the Middle Ages competes with Japanese rice-paper. 
Some menus, with their seals and ribbons, are like a 
charter of nobility, whilst others are in the form of 
beautiful miniature fans. 

For some time there has been a reaction against 
extravagant luxury, which is being replaced by a sim- 
plicity not less excessive. Sometimes the names of the 
dishes are written by hand on thick paper, without any 
ornamentation. As usual, the best kind are between 
these excesses of ostentation and severity. Menus of 
out-of-the-way and awkward shapes are at all times to be 
avoided, because they encumber the table and are 
difficult to consult. 

Without microscopical print, they should be suffi- 
ciently small to be readable without remark, and not add 
to the embarrassment caused by a succession of glasses 
and other articles on the table. The menu card is a 
simple accessory, and should be treated as such. This 
rule ought to be taken into consideration when ordering 
the shapes and sizes. 

When a menu card has too much prominence given 
at the table, we run the risk of it being said that " the 
dinner on the paper is better than that on the plates." 

Among the many points that a cook has to study 
in order to be perfect in his profession, the composition 
of a menu is undoubtedly one of the most important. 

The number of guests for which a meal is to be 
provided must first of all be taken into considera- 
tion ; then the style — that is to say, whether it is to be 
an expensive or plain luncheon, dinner, or supper that 
is required, for the menus are generally compiled 
according to the means and positions of the guests. 



708 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

The bills of fare vary according to the seasons of the 
year, and are made up as a rule vdth dishes appropriate 
to the times ; there are also certain rules and regula- 
tions which must at all times be strictly observed. 

In compiling a menu it is necessary to study the 
variety of dishes, and their selection, for each dish 
should vary by its colour and taste from those served 
before or after. The character of dishes must be retained 
throughout ; sauces should correspond in taste and 
colour with the viands with which they are intended 
to be served. If there are two soups quoted on a 
menu, one ought to be clear and the other thick ; 
should the thick soup be a puree of vegetables, the clear 
soup must contain no vegetable roots as garnishing. 

When two or more fish are to be served, the first, as 
a rule, is boiled, and generally a large fish, such as 
turbot, salmon, cod, &c. ; the next one would be a small 
fish, either fi-ied or broiled. Whitebait are often served 
as a third fish. 

The entrees should always be so classified that 
light dishes, such as rissoles, bouchees, croquettes, 
quenelles, kromeskis, &c., are served first of all. 

If there are two removes, poultry is served before 
the butcher's meat. 

The cardinal point is to have all dressed removes 
served before the plain roasted ones. 

What is called the second service on a menu in- 
cludes the roast, the savoury, and the sweet entremets, 
the dessert, and cheese. When two or more sweets are 
served, the first one is to be hot and the other cold. 

If fancy savouries are given, they come in after the 
sweets, for they are intended to prepare the palate for 
the taste of the choice wines which usually follow a good 
dinner. 



MENUS AND THEIR COMPILATION 709 

In preparing a bill of fare for a large dinner it is 
advisable to avoid such dishes which are difficult to 
dress when done in a great number, for they will cause 
complication and needless profusion in the kitchen, and 
often lead to a confusion in the service. It is also most 
unwise to use new names of dishes which are not known, 
or which may be known under a different title, for they 
will only puzzle the diner, who might not know the 
technical names of old dishes. Avoid also the use of 
pompous names of dishes, especially when the cost for 
their preparation is not known, for they often lead to 
confusion and disappointment. The names of high- 
standing personalities, towns, countries, &c., are applied 
in connection with many dishes ; the French cuisme 
especially has the names given to dishes in honour of 
men who gained their celebrity either by their talent as 
diplomats, statesmen, soldiers, artists, or such who 
have distinguished themselves by their gastronomic or 
epicurean merits. Hence we have such names in con- 
nection with certain dishes as LucuUus, Savarin, 
Louis XV., Soubise, Kichelieu, Careme, Maintenon, 
Conde, Colbert, Villeroy, Talleyrand, Nesselrode, Demi- 
doff, Marie-Louise, Montglas, Victoria, &c. 

These names, as well as many others, are associated 
with various culinary preparations, and are recognised 
by cooks of all nations. 

There are, unfortunately, some narrow-minded 
cuisiniers who are in the habit of altering the genuine 
names of dishes, to which they adopt some other high- 
sounding names, in order to make themselves famous, 
but will only succeed in making themselves look ridi- 
culous and small in the eyes of a real gourmand, who is 
not likely to be thus deceived. If, however, the com- 
position of a certain dish is due to the talent and 



710 



PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 



initiative of tlie cook, then the case is different, and he 
■will have a perfect right to name such a dish according 
to his fancy. 

The importance of a well-composed menu is so great 
that it adds to the success of a dinner in a great 
measure, whilst a defectively composed menu may 
compromise the reputation of a good chef. Although 
the menu may be of little use to some people, it is in- 
dispensable to connoisseurs who understand the language 
of the kitchen, for they will be able to judge the kind 
of dinner on analysing the menu, and by so doing be 
able to give their verdict as to the capacity of the chef, 
according to the arrangement of the dishes and the 
combination of the ■sdands.

THE DEFEAT OF COFFEE 833 



COFFEE. 



How many writers have vaunted the good effects of coffee I 
Heroes, statesmen, and philosophers have bowed over their fili- 
gree cups ; and Frederick of Prussia, Napoleon, Talleyrand, and 
Metternich have all acknowledged and felt the inspiration of the 
fragrant berry. 

There are various methods of preparing the infusion. The best 
coffee in the world is probably made in Paris ; though the very 
finest qualities of coffee come to the London market. The usual 
method of making the beverage in France is a la Duheloy, which 
consists in pouring boiling water on coffee placed in a porcelain 
or silver vase, colandered or pierced with very small holes. The 
first decoction is poured off, heated to boiling heat, and passed 
again through the coffee-pot, when a clear and exquisite coffee is 
produced. Not more than a full-sized tablespoonful of coffee 
should be allowed for each guest in making a small cup of coffee 
for after dinner. 

Here is a recipe of Dr. Koques's for a cafe a la creme frapjye 
a la glace. It is a delicious breakfast beverage during the summer 
heats. Make a strong infusion of Mocha, or Bourbon coffee ; put 
it in a porcelain bowl, sugar it properly, and add to it an equal 
portion of boiled milk or one-third the quantity of rich cream. 
Surround the bowl with powdered ice. Coffee, it may be added, 
should be hot, clear, and strong, and, like every other good thing, 
should be taken in moderation. 



THE DEFEAT OF COFFEE. 

"The imports of coffee are steadily declining in favour of 
tea." — Daily Paj^er. 

Alas, for Mocha ! well it may 

Look piteous and pout. 
For Tea is more than ever in, 

And Coffee's going out. 

" Boheajavi satis !" Coffee cries 

" 'Tis clear you will wrong go ; 
You do not let your victims sleep, 

No more does Mr. Congo." 

Said Congo, " Coffee, you're a fool, 

Your ruin's past postponing; 
You've had your day, 'tis over now, 

'Tis you that should be moaning " {Moning). 



834 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

NOTES ON LAYING A TABLE 

IN 

THE ENGLISH STYLE. 

The manner of laying a table is nearly the same in all parts 
of the United Kingdom. A centre ornament, whether it be 
a plateau, an epergne, or a candelabrum, is found very 
convenient and contributes so much to the good appearance of 
the table that a dinner is seldom or never set out without some- 
thing of the kind. A very false taste is, however, often shown 
in centre ornaments. Strange, ill-assorted nosegays and bouquets 
of artificial flowers begin to droop or look faded among hot 
steams. Ornamental articles of family plate, carved, chased, or 
merely plain, can never be out of place, however old-fashioned. 
In desserts, richly-cut glass is ornamental, and the foliage and 
moss, in which the fruits are sometimes embedded, have a good 
effect. Fine white damask and a green cloth underneath 
are indispensable. 

Whether the dinner be of two or three courses, it is managed 
nearly in the same way. Two dishes of fish, dressed in different 
ways if suitable, should occupy top and bottom ; and two soups, 
a white and a brown, or a mild and a high seasoned, are best 
disposed on each side of the centrepiece; the fish sauces are 
placed between the centrepiece and the dish of fish to which 
each is appropriate ; and this, with the decanted wines drunk 
during dinner, forms the first course. 

The second course at a purely English dinner, when there are 
three courses, consists of roasts and stews for the top and 
bottom ; turkey and fowls or fricandeaux, or ham garnished, or 
tongue for the sides, with small made dishes for the corners 
served in covered dishes. 

The third course consists of game, confectionery, the more 
delicate vegetables dressed in the French way ; puddings, 
creams, jellies, &c. 

Caraffes, with the tumblers belonging to, and placed over 
them, are laid at proper intervals ; where hock, champagne, &c., 
&c., are served, they are handed round between the courses. 
When the third course is cleared away, cheese, butter, a fresh 
salad, or sliced cucumber, are usually handed round ; the finger- 
glasses precede the dessert. 

The dessert at an English table may consist merely of two 
dishes of fine fruit at top and bottom. Liqueurs are handed 
round at this stage, and the wines usually drunk after dinner 
are placed, decanted, on the table along with the dessert. 



NOTES ON CARVING 835 

NOTES ON CARVING. 

Nothing is more prejudicial than bad carving. A joint, ill- 
carved at first by one, is alvv^ays disregarded by the other 
members; and frequently from this circumstance a joint of great 
weight and price is no longer presentable, and is left, to the loss 
of the establishment. In serving soup, one ladleful to each plate 
is sufficient. A steel knife applied to fish is likely to spoil the 
delicacy of its flavour ; so that it should be helped with a silver 
slice or trowel, and be eaten with a silver knife and fork. Do 
not pour sauce over meat or vegetables, but a little on one side. 
In helping at table, never employ a knife where you can use a 
spoon. 

The fairest mode of cutting a ham, so as to serve fat and lean 
evenly, is to begin at a hole in tlie centre of the thickest part, 
and cut from it thin circular slices ; by this means also the 
moisture and flavour of the ham are best preserved. 

The upper part of a roast sirloin of beef should be carved at 
the end, and never cut in the middle, unless you wish to destroy 
the joint in revenge. 

Be careful always to cut down straight to the bone, by which 
method you never spoil the joint, and help many persons with 
little meat ; what remains looks well, and is good to eat. 

In carving a leg of mutton, slice it lightly, else, if you press 
too heavily, the knife will not cut, you will squeeze out all the 
gravy, and serve your guests with dry meat. 

Eustache Ude considers a saddle of mutton is usually carved 
contrary to taste and judgment. " To have the meat in the 
grain, pass your knife straight to one side of the chine, as close 
as possible to the bone ; then turn the knife straight from you, 
and cut the first slice out, and cut slices lean and fat. By 
disengaging the slices from the bone in this manner, it will 
have a better appearance, and you will be able to assist more 
guests." 

If you begin to carve a joint in the middle, the gravy will 
run out on both sides, and the meat shrink and become dry, and 
be no more presentable 

Never pour gravy over white meat, as the latter should retain 
its colour. 

Of roasted fowl, the breast is the best part ; in boiled fowl, 
the leg is preferable. 

The shoulder of a rabbit is very delicate ; and the brain is a 
tit-bit for a lady. 

In helping roast pheasant or fowl, add some of the cresses 
with which it is garnished. 

The most elegant mode of helping hare is in fillets, so as not 
to give a bone, which would be a breach of good manners. 



836 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

Before cutting tip a wild duck, slice the breast, and ponr over 
the gashes a few spoonfuls of sauce, composed of port wine or 
claret (warmed), lemon-juice, salt, and cayenne pepper. 

The most delicate parts of a calf's head are the bits under 
the ears, next the eyes, and the side next the cheek. 

If cray-fish be added to a fricasseed chicken (as in France), 
one of the fish should be placed on the top, in dishing, and served 
to the first guest. 



TRANSLATING THE MENU. 

Erastus Gurley, a noted wag, one day dropped into a cafe for 
dinner. The obsequious waiter bad just flicked a bit of lint 
from his customer's coat collar when Mr. Gurley opened out on 
him. 

" Yes," he said, glancing at the menu, " you may bring me 
some eggs blushing like Aurora." 

"Beg pardon, sir," explamed the waiter, "it's not on the 
bill." 

" Isn't, eh ? What's this, ceufs a Vaurore ? " 

" Oh, yes," replied the young man, blushing and shifting 
somewhat uneasily. 

" And I feel like having some breeches in the royal fashion, 
with velvet sauce." 

The waiter turned red, white, and blue. 

" Got you again," chuckled Mr. Gurley. " Well, I suppose 
you call it culottes a la royale, sauce veUnite.^^ 

'* Oh, that I Yes, sir ; yes, sir ; " and the waiter briskly 
rattled the cutlery around the plate as though he would fain 
drown Mr. Gurley's voice. 

" Be sure you bring a stew of good Christians." 

*' Now you are joking," mildly expostulated the waiter, with a 
sickly smile. 

" Not a bit of it, man. See here on your bill. Compote de 
bons Chretiens" 

" O — ah — ugh," gulped the waiter. 

" And a mouthful of ladies." 

" Eh ? " 

" BoucMe de dames — quick, help — a glass of water — dash it in 
his face ! " 

But Mr. Gurley was too late. The waiter was in a dead 
swoon, from which he never recovered until later in the 
afternoon.

838 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

NOTES ON WINES FOR THE TABLE. 

The wine required for dinner should be on table before dinner 
is served, to be agreeably presented to the consumer, and should 
be of the canonical temperature, it being generally conceded that 
red wines should be warm as compared with white wines, which 
should be cooler, and, as some prefer, even iced or refreshed on 
the ice before being drunk. To arrange this properly obviously 
necessitates a little time. Most wines are considerably improved 
by being decanted or jugged. It is calculated that the ordinary 
wine-drinker wastes about one-third of the value of his wine, 
and sacrifices a considerable proportion of his enjoyment thereof, 
by allowing it to be served " in the black bottle." Not only has 
wine, and especially old wine, no chance of developing or expan ^ 
ding those ethers, flavours, and bouquets, which are in truth the 
enjoyable characteristics of good liquor ; but, by continually 
" sloshing " the bottle up and down as each glass is filled, the 
consumer unavoidably disturbs the sediment, of which the 
connoisseur is naturally most desirous to get rid, seeing that it is 
a deposit induced by an incipient fermentation to which all pure 
wines are liable, whatever their cost or character may happen 
to be. In point of fact, the higher class wines are probably 
those that require the most careful handling of a skilful butler 
or wine-steward. 

Among wines it is usual to place those of France first, and 
Champagne first among the wines of France. It was in the 
neighbourhood of Epernay that the first sparkling wine was 
made. The process of manufacture has not changed much since 
the beginning. Both red and white grapes are grown in the 
Marne. The red gives a drier wine, the white a softer one ; and 
the two are generally mixed together, so as to make a satisfactory 
average. Great care has to be exercised in gathering the red 
grapes, and much swiftness used in pressing them, so that none 
of the colouring matter contained in the skin be communicated 
to the juice. In hot years, like 1874, the grapes are so ripe that 
they easily burst when they are gathered, and during the 
pressing some of the pigments of colour from the skin commu- 
nicate that light pink hue which distinguishes vintages like 
1874 ; but, on the other hand, hot seasons usually give an 
exceptional wine. Immediately after pressing, the juice is stored 
in casks and directly undergoes the first stage of fermentation, 
after which it is racked so as to be freed from the heavier lees. 
The area that can be planted as vineyards in the Champagne 
district is rather limited, and as the demand has gone on increa- 
sing at a very rapid rate, prices have been forced up, and other 
districts of France have tried their hand at making sparkling 
wine. Thus we have seen sparkling Burgixndy, sparkling Chablis, 
sparkling Saumur — all excellent wines for the prices they are 
sold at.

CLARETS— BORDEAUX. 

The name of Claret is practically given to all red wine coming 
from France, with the exception of Burgundy and Roussillon, 
which form small classes apart. The best clarets are those 
grown in the Gironde, but there are many other departments 
which furnish claret to Bordeaux, to Paris, and to foreign parts. 
There is no single district in France capable of producing all 
the wine drunk as claret, so the merchant has to buy large 
quantities from the Herault, Aude, Gard, Gironde, Charente, Cher, 
Burgundy, and Anjou districts. One wine is rich in colour and 
body ; another is thin ; a third, like the Charente wine, is 
"fresh." These are blended in bond, and make up a very 
pleasant, drinkable wine, which has the great advantage of 
being moderate in price, principally because it is not the produce 
of one single district. 

Claret is made in a very simple way. The red grapes are 
gathered, taken to the farmhouses, and crushed between two 
grooved cylinders.

FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 849 

PAKT VIII. 
FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES. 



THE WORKS OF DB. WILLIAM KITOHINER 
AND DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON. 

Dr. William Kitchiner was born in London in 1775, and died 
February 26, 1827. He is described by biographers as a " mis- 
cellaneous writer," but his interest to us depends entirely upon 
his ha\ing at one time or another written a book on culinary 
matters, which he styled " The Cook's Oracle," and which earned 
a reputation that it has maintained undiminished up to the 
present time. 

This book is before me as I write, and as it was published in 
William Gunter's time (1827 — the same year that Dr. Kitchiner 
went over to the majority), and William Gunter afterwards 
published a book which he styled "The Confectioner's Oracle," as 
a " companion " to Dr. Kitchiner's, so he himself announced, it 
may be safely conjectured that the work of one was equally 
suitable for the culinary " profession " as the other, and that 
" The Cook's Oracle " was not for family use only. At any rate, 
it was regarded with so much respect by the late William Gunter, 
who should be considered an authority, that he has quoted its 
doctrines extensively, for possibly even Gunter was impressed by 
the learned doctor, even to the extent of believing him to be a 
professional cook by virtue of his medical knowledge and endow- 
ments. And Dr. Kitchiner was a professed cook in every sense 
of the word, for not only did he study the chemistry of cooking 
in all its details, but he actually cooked and ate of every dish, 
sauce, or anything else that he prepared himself, or of which he 
published the recipe, so as to ensure three great points — namely, 
that the taste was up to the mark, and the food wholesome and 
economical : matters that are not always observed by the first- 
class chefs of to-day ! 

In Dr. Kitchiner's writings there is a good deal to amuse, 
even if there is not much to instruct us ; at any rate, though only 
a trifle be gained, yet nothing can be lost by a little study o£ 
our ancient gastronomer's work. 

He tells us that it is not right to say that a medical man 
cannot write a book upon cookery if he is not a practical cook. 
By an attentive consideration of the "rudiments of cookery," 
and the respective recipes, a novice in the business of the kitchen 
may work with facility and certainty of success, and soon become 
an expert. Dr. Kitchiner was much assisted in his labours by 



850 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

Mr. Henry Osborne, the excellent cook to Sir Joseph Banks, who 
was then President of the Eoyal Society, who had been a great 
traveller in his time, besides having journeyed round the world, 
where he picked up some foreign novelties and tastes like other 
epicures. Several books upon cookery have been written by 
physicians : — Sir Kenelm Digby, one of the physicians to 
Charles I. ; Sir Theodore Mayerne, a physician to Henry IV. 
(in Paris), James I., and afterwards to Charles I. ; Professor 
Bradley, Dr. Hill, Dr. Le Cointe, Dr. Hunter, and others. He 
says that a physician, who studies the practice as well as the 
science of the thing, is the best authority on this subject of 
cookery ; but if rve ask whether a woman can write a book on 
cookery, we must see what Dr. Samuel Johnson says on this 
subject : — 

" Some people have a foolish way of not minding, or pretend- 
ing not to mind, what they eat ; for my part, I mind my belly" — 
and he had one to mind too — " very studiously and very carefully, 
and I look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will 
hardly mind anything else." 

And then, again, he once observed to his friends : " I could 
write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written ; 
it should be a book on philosophical principles ; I would tell 
what is the best bucher's meat, the proper seasons of different 
vegetables, and then, iiow to roast, and to boil, and to compound." 

'* ' Mrs. Glasse's Cookery Book,' which is reckoned the best,'' 
said Mr. Dilly, the publisher, " was written by Dr. Hill." 

"Well, sir, this shows," continued Johnson, " how much better 
the subject of cookery may be treated by a philosopher ; but you 
shall see what a book of cookery I shall make, and shall agree 
with Mr. Dilly for the copyright." 

Miss Seward — Johnson's housekeeper — observed, " That would 
be Hercules with the distaff, indeed I " 

" No, madam," replied Johnson, snuffily : " women can spin 
very well, but they cannot make a good book of cooker3\" 

Women have made a few of them, though, in later years, and 
very excellent books they are — being practical if not philoso- 
phical or Johnsonian. 

Boswell says of this Johnson : " never knew a man who 
relished good eating more than he did ; when at table he was 
absorbed in the business of the moment, nor would he, unless 
in very high company, say one word, or even pay the least 
attention to what was said by others, until he had satisfied his 
appetite," which was no trifling matter, we are told ; so that, if 
being a thoroughbred glutton and an epicure as well qualifies a 
man for giving an opinion on cookery, surely Dr. Johnson's 
remarks may be taken as evidence enough. 








^(W AXTOXIX CAREME <^ V 



FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 851 



ANTONIN CAREME, 1784-1833. 

Antonin Caeeme — or, to give him his full title, Marie-Antonin 
Careme — was a clief of whom all cooks should feel proud ; for, as 
a French historian tells us, although he rose from nothing, 
having been " suddenly deserted in his childhood by his parents, 
in an agony of destitution " —yet he rose, by his own magni- 
ficent talents, from the lowest condition to the highest, to be 
one of the greatest of chefs and to administer to the tastes and 
bodily requirements of Talleyrand, Rothschild, the Emperor 
Alexander of Russia, our King George the Fourth, and many 
others. 

" The name of Careme," says Larousse, in his " Dictionnaire 
Universelle," "has become proverbial to designate, in a manner, 
the ideal of a perfect cook. Careme was not only a practitioner 
'of the first water, but was also deeply learned in the culinary 
art, and all that appertains to it. He studied for a long time 
the ancient cookery of Rome when she was unequalled for 
her la-sdsh luxury and munificence, but of their table productions 
he expresses himself unfavourably. He comments in high terms 
upon their table decorations, cups, bowls, flowers, music, and 
all that, but of their dishes he says nothing of a noteworthj'- 
character." 

M, Antonin Careme was born at Paris in 1784, and as a 
youth attracted the attention of M. Laguipi^re, who took him 
in hand as a lad, and sowed the seeds in him that produced 
such splendid results. This great and generous service was not 
forgotten by Careme, and it is thus that he memorialises his 
friend and patron : — 

" To the Memory of Lagmpiere. 
" Rise, oh illustrious shade of Laguipiere ! Hear the words 
of a man who was thy devout admirer and pupil. Tiiy extra- 
ordinary talents have brought down upon you the hatred and 
persecution of those who ought to esteem you in recognition of 
thy noble efforts for the perfection of thine art. But what am 
I saying ? Is it fitting for a man of talent to enjoy in peace the 
fruit of his mental labours ? Have I not had a pitiable experience 
of it ? vicissitude ! ignorance ! O Laguipiere, infamous 
calumny has indeed surrounded thee with tribulation — on ac- 
count of which thou hast been forced to quit thy beautiful 
country, and go to serve, in Italy, a powerful man for whom you 
recently made delicacies in the Elysee-Bourbon. Thou hast 
followed thy king into Russia ; but, alas ! by a most deplorable 
fatality amongst military pomps, thou hast perished ; thy hands 
and feet frozen by the frightful climate of the north. You were 
compelled to sit without moving behind the cairiage of your 
king, longing to quit this murderous land ; but, alas ! implacable 



852 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

Death was already knocking at the door. Arrived at Wilna, thy 
generous prince was lavish with his gold to save you, but thy 
dying body could no longer take nourishment. 

" Oh, my master ! thou hast lived persecuted and, to com- 
plete the sorrowful chapter, thou hast died in agony a thousand 
times more cruel than hunger, or the icy cold of the north. 

" grand Laguipiere ! upon this solemn day, accept the 
public homage of a faithful pupil. Yes, in spite of thy enviers, 
I will associate your name with my works. Already, in my 
works I have quoted you with pride, and this day, so dear to my 
heart, I league with your memory the best of them all. This 
will bear witness in the future to the elegance and sumptuosity 
of the culinary art in the eighteenth century ; and, if Vatel is 
rendered illustrious, by a sense of honour dear to every man of 
merit, thy unhappy end, Laguipiere, renders thee well worthy 
of being also illustrious. It was due to thy sense of honour 
that made you willing to follow your prince into Russia, 
and you were then a witness to the disasters by which you 
yourself were struck down. But, alas 1 you of all people ought 
to have died in Paris. Thy white hairs seemed to ensure for 
you a better fate ; yet you shared the sad lot of our veterans, 
and the honour of our martial ranks, perishing of hunger and of 
cold under the frigid sky of Russia. 

" u Laguipiere ! may thy remain* rest peacefully in the 
tomb ; thy renown has revenged all thy injuries." 

Careme adds to this elegy the following note : — " In the 
frightful campaign of 1812 we lost a great number of cooks 
belonging to the marshals of France and ministers of Napoleon. 
Of more than twenty men who composed the personal domestic 
staff of the Duke de Narbonne only two escaped from this 
terrible catastrophe." 

This pitiful story of Laguipiere is worth recording, but to 
what Careme alludes as the infamous calumnies and persecution 
that drove him from his country we are unable to discover. 
Apparently cooks are quite as subject to scandal as their masters, 
and often more so, and that probably with greater justice than 
it would at all times be convenient to acknowledge. 

We are told that Careme was illustrious by descent, " for his 
ancestors had served in the household of a Pope, who himself 
made more sauces than saints, Leo X." But Careme was one of 
so poor and so numerous a family, that when he came into the 
world he was no more welcome than Oliver Goldsmith was. 

Careme, it is said, studied under various great masters of the 
kitchen, but perfected his studies under Boucher, the chef to 
Prince Talleyrand. The glory of Careme was crowned with that 
of Napoleon. Those two individuals were great men at the same 
time, but the glory of one will, perhaps, be a little more enduring 
than that of the other. In the days of the Empire — "the era of 



FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 853 

the greatness, of the achievements, and of the reflections of 
Careme " — the possession of him was as eagerly contested by 
the rich as that of a nymph by the satyrs. " He was alternately 
the glory of Talleyrand, the boast of Lavalette, and the pride of 
the ISaxon ambassador. In their houses, too, his hand was as 
often on his pen as on the handle of his casserole ; and inspira- 
tion never visited his brain without the call being duly registered 
"in his note-book, with reflections thereon highly philosophical 
and gastronomic." 

But Careme appears to have been of a rather capricious 
nature, and passed from kitchen to kitchen as the bee wings from 
flov/er to flower, and possibly also equally in quest of " hone3^" 
The Emperor Alexander dined with Talleyrand, and forthwith 
he seduced Careme ; the seduction money was £100 a month, 
and all culinary expenses. But Careme did not yield without a 
little exhibition of coyness. " He urged his love for study, his 
desire to refine the race (of chefs') of which he made himself the 
model, his love for his country," and, possibly, a lively recollec- 
tion of the sufferings of Laguipi^re in Kussia. Whilst the 
Emperor was baiting his hook to catch Careme, that gentleman 
started off to Vienna with Lord Stewart, taking care, however, to 
leave a trail by which he could be followed. Count OrlofE was 
soon set off upon his track, and, after following the artful worthy 
to London and Paris, persuaded him at last to do the Emperor 
Alexander the honour of taking the head of the Imperial 
kitchen. 

But he did not stop in Russia very long, for his book of 
expenses was subject to supervision, which gave him great 
offence, and he flung up his appointment in disgust. Careme 
repaired to France, and entered the service of the Princess 
Bagration, and served the table of that whimsical lady to such 
good effect that she dubbed him, before her gratified friends, as 
" The Pearl of Cooks " ('* La Perle des Cuisiniers "). 

This princess ate herself into a permanent indigestion, and 
Careme then transferred his attachment to the English ambas- 
sador at the court of Vienna. " There, every morning, seated in 
his magnificent kitchen, Careme received the visit of ' Milor 
Stewart,' who seldom left him without presents and encourage- 
ments. Indeed, these rained upon the immortal artist. The 
Emperor Alexander had consented to have Careme's projects in 
culinary architecture dedicated to him, and, with notice of 
consent, sent him a diamond ring, which Prince Walkonski 
placed on his finger." 

Two years before George IV. came to the throne, Careme was 
for a short time a member of the Piegent's household. He left 
Vienna to be present at the coronation, but arrived too late, and 
he docs not scruple to say, very ungenerously, that the banquet 
was spoiled for want of his presence, nor to insinuate that the 



854 PEACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

colleagues with whom he would have been associated were 
unworthy of such an association. After being the object of a 
species of semi-worship, and yielding to every new offer, yet 
affecting to despise them all, Careme ultimately joined the house- 
hold of Baron Rothschild, in Paris. George IV". is said to have 
tempted him by offering triple salaries; but all in vain, for 
London was too triste an abiding place for a man whose soul, 
out of kitchen hours, was given to study. And so Careme 
remained with his patron, " until infirmity overtook his noble 
nature, and he retired to dictate his immortal words to his 
accomplished daughter." 

Even in his retirement Careme was eagerly sought after, but 
he was deaf to the voice of the tempter. Money was no longer 
an object with him, for he was realising twenty thousand francs 
a year from the booksellers, besides the interest of the money he 
had saved. "Think of it, shade of Milton (Milton used to 
dictate to his daughter)," shrieks a writer of recent years, 
" eight hundred pounds sterling yearly for writing on kitchen- 
stuff ! Who would compose epics after that ? " But Careme's 
books are " epics " after their sort, and a fitting monument of a 
famous man, who had been "the imperial despot of European 
kitchens, had been ' be-ringed ' by monarchs, and been smiled on 
by princesses ; he had received lords in his kitchen, and had 
encountered ladies who gave him a great deal for a very little 
knowledge in return." 

Wheri we look back upon the past history of the kitchen, it 
seems rather more than a paradox why it should be that, 
although so many clever cooks have left their marks in literature, 
yet so little is known of their personal qualities, or history. 
Antonin Careme is the chef to whom the title " Father of Modern 
Chefs " was once most aptly applied ; but how many good chefs 
have existed since then, and fretted their hour upon the stage to 
pass into oblivion — a memorable instance of the ingratitude of 
mankind, and of epicures in particular, towards those who have 
served them well. One wrote immortal poetry and starved, the 
other made delicious pastry and rode in a chariot ! We know 
how much Oliver received for his " Vicar," whilst Antonin 
Careme used to receive twice as much for merely \sTiting out a 
recipe to make a ^«fe. Nay, Careme's untouched patties, when 
they left royal tables, were bought up at a large price ; and 
a cold sugared entremet, at the making of which Careme had 
presided, was only obtainable by such as had plenty of money 
at their command.

FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 855 



LOUIS EUSTACHE UDE. 

Ude issued the tenth edition, " corrected and enlarged," of his 
renowned " French Cook, adapted to the use of English Families," 
from Crockford's Club House, St. James's Street. He signs it 
thus: "By Louis Eustache Ude, ci-devant cook to Louis XVI. 
and the Earl of Sefton ; late Steward to the United Service Club, 
to his late Royal Highness the Duke of York ; and now Maitre 
(T Hotel at Crockford's Club, St. James's Street." The book was 
sold everywhere by the elite among the booksellers, and Ude no 
doubt made a large fortune over his publications, which still 
maintain a great reputation. 

Ude spoke out, but he spoke for himself, and his w^ords were 
noble concerning the art of cookery, so far as he and a few others 
were concerned. Ude was a florid writer, but he made himself 
felt, and he has probably not been surpassed in self-confidence b}'" 
any other writer in any other profession. He felt his importance, 
and acted upon it ; but in the eyes of many he was "only a cook " 
after all. Ude, however, maintained, and there is much reason 
in his argument, that to compose an oratorio or opera was an 
easier feat than to invent a new enlrce, and that a man of the 
requisite natural endowments could sooner qualify himself to 
compete wath the Royal Academicians than with the chief 
operators in cookery. " I shall," he observes, " demonstrate the 
difficulty of the art by some observations in other arts. Music, 
painting, and mechanics in general possess professors under 
twenty years of age, whereas in the iirst line of cooking pre- 
eminence never occurs under thirty. We see daily at the 
concerts and academies young men and women who displa}' the 
greatest abilities, but in our line nothing but the most consum- 
mate experience can elevate a man to the rank of Chief 
Professor." 

The precise age when Ude served his apprenticeship in 
cooker}- is difficult to state; but this is certain: he was not a 
youth when he definitively fixed upon the culinary art for his 
living. 

Again : " Prescriptions, we must admit, are dispensed by 
weight and measure ; but dishes owe their virtue to sympath}-, 
tact, nervous sensibility, and momentary inspirations." 

"The pharmacist," he continues, with that bombast that 
rendered him comparatively uninfluential, " is obliged to weigh 
every ingredient that he employs, as he does not like to taste it ; 
the cook, on the contrary, must taste often, as the reduction 
increases the flavour. It would be blind work, indeed, without 
tasting ; the very best soups in which you have omitted to put 
salt are entirely without flavour ; seasoning is in cookery what 



856 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

chords are in music ; the best instruments in the hands of the 
best professors, without their being in tune, are intolerable." 

Speaking of Gonthier d'Andernach, whom he designates 
" the Father of Cookery in France," and " a star which shone in 
the Reformation," Ude exclaims with emotion, "What Bacon 
was to philosophy, Dante and Petrarch to poetry, Michael 
Angelo and Raphael to painting, Columbus and Gama to 
geogTaphy, Copernicus and Galileo to astronomy, Gonthier was 
in France to the art of cooker3^" That was pretty good for 
praise ; but he continued, " Gonthier appeared to raise the 
culinary edifice, as Descartes, a century after him, raised that of 
philosophy. Both introduced doubt — the one in the moral 
(or should it be ' social ' 1) and the other in the political world." 

Mr. Ude has managed to raise a little doubt in his own world, 
for there appears to have been no public record taken of his 
birth. All we can learn of his antecedents dates from his active 
life as a cook — he promised once, we are told, to write the 
memoirs of his life; but, alas ! poor Ude was no more immortal 
than the best of them. For upwards of twenty years Ude served 
Lord Sef ton, and introduced the light sandwich ball supper so 
much in favour in present times. Ude was also once maitre 
dliotel to H.R.H. the Duke of York, from whom, it is re- 
ported, "he contrived to elicit many a hearty laugh by his 
clever mimicry." Under his auspices, also, " the great play- 
house in St. James's, Crockford's, was ushered into its de- 
structive career." Another authority upon these matters, and 
who seems to know about as much of Ude's career as 
anybody, tells us that " Louis Eustache Ude was verily the 
Gil Bias of the kitchen. He had, in his latter days, a notion of 
writing his memoirs ; and if they had not proved deeply 
interesting, those who knew him well can with truth assert 
that many would have relished the curious scandal and pleasant 
gossip with which his astonishing memory was so well stored. 
Ude's mamma was an attractive and lively milliner, who 
married an underling in Louis X VI. 's kitchen," hence he found a 
welcome there, and was duly christened after the king. Ude was 
intended to be brought up as a priest or to study medicine. 
" The mother, however, thouglit Master Eustache too pretty a 
boy to be sacrificed to the priesthood. The consequence was 
that, after an attempt made by his sire to train him in his own 
glorious xjath, the youngster absconded, and apprenticed himself , 
first to a jeweller, then to an engraver, next to a printer, and 
lastly to a haberdasher I After which he became traveller for 
a mercantile house at Lyons. Something occurred to him at 
this point which occasioned him to change his vocation once 
more. He returned to Paris, and there tried his genius as an 
actor at a small theatre. He soon, however, discovered that 
his share of the world's cake was not on that stage, and, by 



FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICUEES 857 

some means, he set up an office and a cabriolet^ and forthwith 
started into life as an agent de change. This scheme did not 
last long; he got cleane_d out on 'Change, and shortly after was 
installed as an inspector of gambling-houses. He soon tired of 
this appointment, and, on relinquishing it, determined to return 
to his original calling, and became once again a cook." 

" After practising in the culinary profession some few years 
in the early dawn of the fortunes of the house of Bonaparte, 
Ude raised himself to the post of maitre cVhotel to Madame 
Letitia Bonaparte. Here he remained for about two years, 
when, owing to some difference of opinion between Madame 
Letitia and himself in matters ' arithmetical,' he somewhat 
suddenly left that lady's service to honour England with his 
presence ; and ever after, when fitting opportunity presented 
itself, he was wont to express his indignation against the 
vsurpateur and all his family. Good cooks were scarce in 
England in those days, and, shortly after his arrival, the late 
Earl of Sefton secured his services at a salary of 300 guineas 
per annum ; and not only proved himself a liberal and kind- 
hearted patron during his lifetime, but, with that benevolence 
for which he was remarkable, handsomely provided for the 
old age of his favourite cook by leaving him £100 a year 
for life." 

Ude was the first, it is said, to define clearly the distinction 
between entrees, and entremets. It was usual to use these terms 
very indifferently. Ude said that an entree was "any dish of 
meat, fowl, game, or tish, dressed and cooked for the second 
course," and entremet applied to " all vegetable dishes, jellies, 
pastries, salads, prawns, lobsters, and in general to everything 
that appears in the second course — except the roast. " 



858 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 



ALEXIS SOYER, 1809-1858. 

In October, 1809, at Meaux-en-Brie, a small town in France noted 
for its cheese, called Fromage de Brie, Alexis Soyer first saw the 
light, and was forthwith dedicated to the service of the church 
by his parents, who were small shopkeepers in that town. Alexis 
Soyer had two brothers, Philippe, apprenticed to the kitchen, 
and young Louis to cabinet-making ; but at nine years of age 
our youthful hero was sent to the cathedral church as chorister, 
to earn by his singing a free instruction for the priesthood. He 
is reputed to have possessed a good voice and an ear for music, 
which would have served him well in his devotional practices, 
but which he used in after life to amuse his social companions. - 

Alexis urged his parents to alter his course, but without 
effect, so he thought it well to alter it for himself. The story is 
told that he consummated his desire to leave the church by 
tolling the big bell of the cathedral and giving an alarm of 
fire in the middle of the night, in consequence of which the 
inhabitants were scared out of their slumber and the garri.son 
placed underarms. When the author of this escapade was found 
out, his dismissal from the choir of the cathedral followed as a 
matter of course, much to the distress of his parents, who little 
dreamed then of the fame that was in store for their light-headed 
and light-hearted bantling. 

For some years his future was very undecided, and it was 
not until he was sixteen that he made any move at all towards 
selecting a career, and then his brother Philippe induced him 
to turn his attention to cooking, and accordingly he was 
apprenticed at Grignon in 1826. Having completed his appren- 
ticeship with more or less colat, he was engaged by Douix, the 
well-known restaurateur in the Boulevard des Italiens, with 
whom he remained three years, taking the head of the kitchen 
when little more than seventeen. But Soyer's culinary inclina- 
tions were not yet definitely fixed ; he was excessively fond of 
gaiety, therefore his next fancy was for the stage, to which he was 
possibly led by the applause of liis friends and associates, who 
flattered his vanity whilst loudly eulogising his mad pranks, his 
mimicry and mischief. 

In 1830 he was appointed to serve in the Foreign Office as 
second cook, which he did for a few weeks only, when the 
revolution broke out and the kitchen was stormed, Soyer saving 
himself from rough treatment by singing the " Marseillaise " 
with all his might, beating time with a spoon, which led to his 
being carried off in triumph by the mob, whilst all his confreres 
were ill-used, and some were actually shot. It also led in the 
following year to his walking out of the country, scarcely in 
triumph, to London, where he joined his brother in the service

of the late Duke of Cambridge. Thence he found his way to 
the Duke of Sutherland's kitchen, the Marquis of Waterford's, 
and then to Mr. Lloyd's, of Aston Hall, Oswestry. After spend- 
ing some four or five years in this latter engagement, he left it 
to enter the establishment of the Marquis of Ailsa, at Isleworth, 
a gourmet of the very first water. But Soyer left there in 1836, 
having previously contracted an acquaintance with a Miss Emma 
Jones, a clever pupil, and step-daughter of one M. Simonau, a 
Flemish artist in Fitzroy Square. The story goes that Soyer 
wanted a painting of himself to send to an old sweetheart in 
France, but possibly changed his mind about the destination of 
the portrait after making the friendship and awakening a 
reciprocal affection in the heart of this amiable lady. In April, 
1837, the marriage ceremony was solemnised, in the presence of 
Louis Eustache Ude and a select few friends, at St. George's, 
Hanover Square, between Alexis Benoit Soyer and Elizabeth 
Emma Jones. 

Madame Soyer, nee Jones, deserves some special notice, for 
she was a very clever woman in many ways. Not only could she 
paint cleverly, but her skill as a musician was considered of a 
very superior character, although it is a noteworthy fact that her 
pictures, which were her strongest point, were declined at the 
Koyal Academy, in spite of Soyer's very enterprising letter to 
the president, requesting his particular consideration. Soyer 
was given to versify at times, and he made the president's reply 
to him, and the hanging committee's refusal of his wife's 
painting, the subject of some bitter metrical lampoons. Madame 
Soyer's end was of a very tragical character, and happened whilst 
her husband was on a trip to Brussels, in the suite of the Duke 
of Saxe Coburg. 

The first of Soyer's literary efforts was entitled *' The Gastro- 
nomic Kegenerator," which had a splendid sale of over 2,000 
copies in twelve months, at a guinea apiece. His next effort 
was as the writer of a ballet, " La Fille de I'Orage." M. Soyer 
could be as rcclierclie in his imaginary as in his I'eal dishes, 
and there was, probably, no compound with which he used to 
astonish and delight the palates of the members of the Reform 
Club more elaborately and artistically worked up than his 
" Creme de la Grande Bretagne." 

It was in 1837, just before his marriage, that Soyer accepted 
the post of head cook to the Reform Club, and, as his historians 
state, " It was no joke for a young aspirant and a foreigner to 
face some fifteen hundred members of the aristocracy, whose 
refined appetites were on the qxii vire to taste, with severe 
criticism, the productions of the youthful artist. But Soj-er 
was in no wise daunted by such an array, but undertook with 
a light heart to face their severely critical tastes in the 
preparation of a public breakfast, given by the members of the 
club to 2,000 guests. It was about this time — that is, just 



860 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

previous to his marriage — that he made friends with Louis 
Eustache Ude, of Crockford's Club House, with whom he was 
afterwards, with his wife, on terms of friendly intimacy. Ude 
gave a dinner party on the occasion of his birthday, and to this 
M. and Madame Soyer Avere duly invited. The scene is most 
amusingly described by 8oyer, who made great fun out of the 
complications that were occasioned by M. and Madame Ude's 
passion for dogs. 

From all accounts that can be gathered from those who 
knew him Alexis Soyer was a merry fellow, and as full of fun 
as could be — no man loved a practical joke more than he, and 
few were so smart at repartee. One day Lord Melbourne was 
inspecting his kitchen at the Eeform Club, and laughingly 
observed to Soyer that his female assistants were remarkable 
for good looks. " Ah ! my lord," replied Soyer, with a knowing 
smile, " we do not want plain cooks here." 

With reference to Soyer's work in his profession, it has 
been stated by some that there was not so much art displayed as 
originality. This may be so ; but, in any case, whether deserving 
or not, Soyer was a thorough master of the art of making 
himself famous. His method was to make something, or some 
one else, famous first, and then to take his share as the 
promoter : for instance, every aristocrat in the country paid a 
visit to his "model" kitchen at the Reform Club, and these 
Soyer would conduct himself, with his red velvet cap set on one 
side of his head and spoon in hand, and, after extolling the 
glories of the place, he would shake up a pan and commence 
to prepare a dish, explaining the process as he went along, and 
then serve it to his guests, requesting the opinion of their 
palates. It might be mentioned that he always had a glass of 
good wine to set alongside, and proclaimed the dishes as being 
specially prepared for some grandee a degree or two at least 
above the status of his visitor. To her ladyship he would say, 

" The Duke of has ordered this dish for to-night ; let us 

taste it," and the result was a certain appreciation. Amongst 
all this gastronomic splendour it is remarkable, though, that 
Soyer's own tastes and habits were exceedingly simple. He tells 
us in one of his works, the " Modern Housewife": " WTien I 
first married our means were limited, and the following w^as our 
system of living : — 

Sunday Dinner . Roast beef, potatoes, greens, and Yorkshire 
pudding. 

Monday „ . Hashed beef and potatoes. 

Tuesday „ . Broiled beef and bones, vegetables, and 
spotted-dick pudding. 

Wednesday „ . Fish, if cheap, chops, and vegetables. 

Thursday „ . Boiled pork, peas-padding, and greens. 

Friday ,, . Pea-soup, and remains of pork. 

Saturday „ . Stewed steak, with suet dumpling." 



FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 861 

Many a time has he been known to dive into some back slum 
and purchase two-pennyworth of fried fish, devouring it with 
consummate relish, and preferring it to a rol-au-vent or cotelette 
of his own cooking. He was a professor of taste, but not a 
gourmet. 

The grand banquets undertaken and designed by Soyer were 
very numerous, the details of which are found in print in his 
books — his Diner Lticidlvsien a la Sampayo was, perhaps, the 
masterpiece of all, at least, he himself pronounced it to be so. 
The Bouquet de Gihier, or nosegay of game, which he presented 
to Louis Philippe, and for which he received such a memorable 
letter in return, was remarkable. It was about ten feet high 
and wide in proportion : " The frame was richly covered with 
Christmas holly, laurel, mistletoe, and evergreen, with a great 
variety of winter flowers. There were twenty-two dozen head of 
game, consisting of larks, snipes, woodcocks, teal, P^ench and 
English partridges, grouse, widgeons, wild ducks, blackcocks, 
pheasants, a leveret, a hare, and golden plovers. The interstices 
were lightly filled with wheat and oats, the whole ornamented 
with tri-coloured ribbon." 

Most have heard of Soyer's visit to Ireland in February of the 
year 1847, and of his praiseworthy efforts to relieve the starving 
peasantry ; also of his model soup-kitchens, and of his relief of 
1,147,278 persons, and the publication of his soup receipts, 
followed by " The Poor Man's Kegenerator." And then of his 
famous sauces and " Relish," and aerial dish at Slough ; his 
philanthropic work in the East of London, and in the Crimea, 
where he so ably assisted Miss Florence Nightingale in her 
efforts to feed the sick and wounded. And now we come to the 
last earthly scene, which occurred in his own house at St. John's 
Wood, on the night of August 5, 1858. He was thus only forty- 
nine years of age when he died ; but he commenced life so early, 
and kept it up so intensely, that it may virtually be said he had 
lived as long again. It was he who described the difference 
between a gourmet and gourmand as being much the same as 
that between a gentleman and a common person. 



862 PRACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

CHARLES E. FRANCATELLT, 1805-1876. 

Chaeles Elme Francatelli is a name familiar to all. He was 
born in London in 1805, and appears to have been at a very early 
date destined for the kitchen. His father was of rather more 
than Italian extraction, and christened him Charles Elm6. At 
a suitable age the lad was sent to France for his education. 
Here he was fortunate enough to fall in with Careme, who was 
becoming a king in his profession. 

It may be said of Francatelli that he taught the Prince of 
Wales to eat macaroni, and Her Gracious Majesty the Queen 
to value the flavour of pistachio in sweets and confectionery. 

It was this culinary artist who first in this country advocated 
the diner a la Russe, of which he thus writes : — 

" Few there are who are not apt to look with a pleasurable 
anticipation on the culinary delicacies before them ; but when 
appetite is appeased, to continue inhaling the now no longer 
agreeable fumes of hacked fragments of even the most perfect 
dishes is little calculated to promote enjoyment ; whereas the 
absence from table of the more substantial fare is fully compen- 
sated by the refreshing elegance of an artistic display of orna- 
mental confectionery, gorgeous fruit, and lovely flowers, which 
form the chief elements of a fashionable dessert." 

Of cooking itself he says: — 

" Simplicity is as essential an element in cookery as it is in 
other arts. The author, therefore, particularly cautions the inex- 
perienced practitioner from attempting too much. Excess in the 
quantity and variety of spices and condiments — the bane of 
English cookery — is especially to be guarded against." 

Whether he used " spices and condiments " at all times with 
the discretion he publicly advocates we are unable to state, but 
an old chef, who was personally acquainted with Francatelli in 
his kitchen at the St. James's Hotel, tells us that, as the chef 
there, he was fond of highly flavouring his sauces. 

Francatelli did not profess, so he says, to cater for the satis- 
faction of coarse appetites, but rather to gratify refined tastes. 
And he alludes to " Guides " and " Oracles," with a decided hit 
at Dr. Kitchiner's " Cook's Oracle," in the following amusing 
words : — 

" Such attempts, too frequently made by English wi'iters on 
gastronomy, at once betray their origin. The greater part of 
these authorities are persons who, having neither studied the 
rudiments nor practised the art to any extent, take upon them- 
selves to instruct the public, not from the fulness of their know- 
ledge, but either as a pecuniary resource or to gratify an idle 
whim. Need it be wondered at, while we possess in England a 
greater abundance of all kinds of food, generally of far better 
quality than is to be found elsewhere, that our cookery in theory 



-J I^

FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 863 

SYid practice has become a by-word of ridicule, and that we should 
be compelled to have recourse to foreigners, ignorant for the most 
part of our tastes and habits, to prepare our feasts," 

The following suggestions that he makes in one of his books 
are worthy of more than a passing comment : — 

" The English custom of dividing a grand dinner into several 
courses is an error quite at variance with common sense and con- 
venience. Tt is a needless complication that necessarily leads to 
useless profusion, and much additional trouble. Our neighbours 
across the Channel allow of two courses only in the largest 
dinners. With them fish and hors d'oeuvres — such as patties, 
croquettes, &c. — form part of the first course, and not a distinct 
course, as they are considered east of Temple Bar. The French, 
too, regard the dessert as a mere delassement after dinner, in- 
tended rather to propitiate than to thwart digestion. 

" I cannot refrain from alluding to an injudicious habit fre- 
quently adopted at English tables — that of introducing sweet 
champagne in the first course. This wine, from its sweetness, 
counteracts the flavour of savoury dishes. Madeira, sherry, and 
burgundy are better suited to the first course, their stimulating 
and generous qualities tending to assist digestion. 

" The ordinary practice in London of serving turtle and veni- 
son indiscriminately, as mere accessories to recherche dinners, 
is, in my opinion, most injudicious. Turtle and venison being 
generally reckoned by us as the best of good cheer, it follows 
that, when they form part of a dinner, the removes and entrees 
are comparatively neglected. Very light entrees should always 
be served with these," &c. 

Amongst his appointments was that of chef de cuisine to 
the Earls of Chelmsford and Dudley, Lord Kinnaird, Sir 
W. Massey Stanley, and Mr. Rowland Errington of Melton 
Mowbray, which town is even now famous for pork-pies 
made from a recipe provided by him. He was for a time 
manager of Crockford's Club, whence he removed to the Eoyal 
Household as maitre d'hotel and chief cook in ordinary to Her 
Majesty. He next superintended the then flourishing Coventry 
House Club, and was for about seven years chef to the Reform 
Club. As manager of the celebrated Freemasons' Tavern he 
did much to ensure the exceeding popularity of that house, which 
it has maintained to the present day. 

As an author on cookery he has had few equals. His first 
work, '* The Modern Cook," appeared in 1845, and ran through 
twelve editions. In 1861 he produced " The Cook's Guide and 
Butler's Assistant," and shortly after a book on " Cookery for 
the Working Classes." Next appeared his " Royal English and 
Foreign Confectionery Book." 

In 1876 he departed this life at the ripe age of seventy-one.

ALFRED SUZANNE. 



Alfeed Suzanne was born in Normandy in the year 1829. 
His father and his grandfather before him were both notable 
chefs ; but he was destined for another sphere of life, and entered 
upon his studies in Paris. Unforeseen circumstances, however, 
determined him to abandon his collegiate career at the age of 
eighteen, and embrace the calling of his parents ; and nowhere 
have we a more striking exemplification of Darwin's hereditary 
theorem than n the case of Suzanne, for, without even a know- 
ledge of the rudiments of cookery, he confesses that he resolutely 
embraced his father's profession, and, student-like, laid the 
foundation of future sxiccess by a careful perusal of the works 
of the immortal Careme, Brillat-Savarin, and the leading 
authorities of the day upon culinary and gastronomic matters. 

With the theoretical information thus acquired, he com- 
menced his practical career as an apprentice in the kitchen of 
the Earl of Clarendon, then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, and, 
mirahile dictu! at the end of six short months found himself 
promoted to the honourable position of head pastrycook at 
Dublin Castle, a position which he held for a period of four 
years. From thence he passed into the service of the Earl of 
Wilton as chef de cuisine. 

The '* wicked Earl " — to give him the name by which he was 
known among his familiars — was at that time at the zenith of his 
fame as a sportsman, musician, lady-killer, and leader of society. 
His epicurism was of the first water, and no man more assidu- 
ously studied his creature comforts. For the lengthened period 
of twenty-eight years M. Suzanne ministered to the delights 
of the table at his lordship's generous board. On the death of 
Lord Wilton, in 1882, the Duke of Bedford secured M. Suzanne 
as controller of his kitchen, and this position he retained for 
five years, until indiflierent health led him to seek permanent 
repose and the otiuvi cum dignitate to which good and even 
brilliant work had entitled him.

In the charming Parisian suburb of Neuilly, M. Suzanne and 
his amiable wife are now domiciled, in circumstances which make 
life worth the living. 

He is, however, by no means idle, for he still contributes 
valuable advice and instruction to the English and French 
catering journals, so that his own countrymen, as well as those 
on this side of the " silver streak," are benefited by the useful 
information he is ever ready to give. 

He is acknowledged to be a great authority on culinary 
matters; and as the author of "Egg Cookery" he has proved 
to be one par excellence on the treatment of eggs, for he describes 
no fewer than two hundred ways of converting them into dainty 
and appetising dishes. 

All those who have come into- contact with M. Suzanne 
are agreed that he is one of Nature's gentlemen, retiring and 
modest, even to a fault ; whilst amongst his canfreres he is 
*' looked up to " with admiration and respect on account of 
his geniality and undoubted abilities. In addition to this, his 
personal accomplishments are of no mean order. He excels as 
a musician and an artist, whilst his work as an amateur photo- 
grapher is worthy of the most unqualified praise. He has 
indeed gained something like notoriety in this department, 
having at different times photographed such leading sports- 
men as the Earl of Bradford, the ill-fated Marquis of 
Hastings, Baron Rothschild, Prince Edward of Saxe- Weimar, 
etc. It was Suzanne who took the portrait of Fred Archer in 
hi^ hunting-dress, upon the occasion of the visit of the cele- 
brated jockey to Melton Mowbray, where the Wilton family 
have their seat. This portrait was quite the rage at the time, 
and attained a sale altogether unlocked for.

EUG]B]NE POUAED. 

Mr. Eugene Pouard was born at Eugny, France, in May, 1841. 
His name is familiar to many as a prominent member of the 
catering fraternity. He is, liowever, best known as the prime 
mover of the first cookery exhibition, held in London in 1885. 
At an early age Mr. Pouard was apprenticed to the catering 
business of Monsieur Sautereau, at Tonnerre, in France, where he 
"served his time" for three years. Having gained a good 
knowledge as cook and pastrycook during the time he was 
apprenticed, he proceeded to the town of the " grandesc^ne" for 
cookery, viz., Paris, where he worked in several noted places, 
and thus gained more knowledge in the art. During the year.s 
1857 and 1858 he oflaciated in the kitchens of Baron Borell, at 
Issue, near Mantes. Anxious to gain still more experience,' he 
resigned this position, and made for the great MetropoHs, where 
he arrived in 1860. His first appointment was at the Guards' 
mess, Curragh camp, Ireland, where he served as second cook, and 
later on as chef for nearly two years. He next proceeded to take 
up a more responsible engagement as chef to the Guards' mess at 
"Windsor, where he remained till February 1868. He was next 
appointed messman to the Brigade of Guards at the Tower of 
London and Windsor. His success here marked him out for 
the responsible duties of a caterer, and he was consequently 
appointed contractor to the Queen's guard, St. James's Palace, 
London, in 1881, where he is still acting in that capacity! 
Besides his official duties, which he always fulfilled to the 
satisfaction of his superiors and to the credit of himself, Mr. 
Pouard at all times took a lively interest in anything concerning 
the promotion of the art of cookery, especially in the various 
exhibitions which were held in London, and he never missed an 
opportunity of making himself useful. He was president of the 
first cookery exhibition, which took place in 1885 ; and the great 
success which this first venture obtained was mainly due to the 
indefatigable manner in which he carried out his duties, which 
were rewarded by a splendid gold cup, accompanied with an 
illuminated diploma. He was again nominated as chairman for 
the Universal Cookery Exhibition held in London in 1888, on 
which occasion he introduced the now famous demonstrations,'and 
lectured upon the delicate treatment of high-class entrees, 
&c., and showed the public how to prepare good things in the 
most practical way. His efforts in connection with this exhibi- 
tion, as well as with five more that followed, were duly appre- 
ciated, and in return for his honorary services he was presented 
with several illuminated addresses and medals ; also with the 
grand decoration of the " Cordon rouge," which the Society of 
that title bestowed upon him. M. Pouard died May 19, 1895. 
His loss is felt by many, for he was a good friend to all who 
sought his help ; beloved and respected by all who knew him, he 
leaves a gap in his professional career which is being much felt.

FAMOUS CHEFS AND EPICURES 867 

ANTOINE A. PARMENTIER. 

The birthplace of Antoine Augustin Parmentier is Mondidier in 
France, wJaere he was born in 1737. France owes much to the 
exertions of Parmentier in introducing the potato as an article 
of diet — one of the most interesting chapters in the history of 
the human race. Parmentier not only introduced this edible 
root into his fatherland, but he also induced his countrymen to 
accept it as a food, and at the same time taught them more 
than twenty different ways of preparing it for the table. At 
first people believed all manner of evil things of the tuber. 
Some alleged that it contained poison, whilst others would have 
it that it produced skin-disease ; and the general verdict was 
that the plant was only fit for pigs' food. The prejudice against 
it even became so strong that in some of the French provinces 
the cultivation of the potato was forbidden under the threat 
of heavy penalties. Parmentier, however, would not be dis- 
couraged by the opposition of his detractors; but, had it not been 
for his great and untiring energy and the protection of the 
king, his efforts to produce and popularise this edible root might 
probably have been in vain. 

The king, Louis XVI., who professed much esteem for the 
great philanthropist, had an interview with him. Parmentier 
lauded the virtues of the potato, explaining that it was a most 
nutritious food, and an excellent and economical substitute for 
bread. As it happened, this was the period of the great famine 
in France, and the king was so impressed and pleased by Par- 
mentier 's earnestness, that he there and then conferred upon 
him a title, the recipient appropriately choosing for his crest a 
potato flower. Furthermore, the royal order went forth that 
fifty acres of uncultivated land, called the Plaine des Sablons, 
should be devoted to the cultivation of potatoes. It is on this 
land that the town of Neuilly now stands. 

Parmentier planted the field with potatoes, and when the 
tuber was ripe and fit for digging he had the place guarded by 
gendarmes, who ostensibly withdrew at dusk. As he anticipated, 
the field was plundered during the night by the people, tempted 
by the charm of forbidden fruit. The taste, thus acquired, spread 
with amazing rapidity amongst all classes. There was then a 
potato mania, and it is said that at a ball given at the palace of 
Versailles the queen and all the ladies were adorned with 
potato blossoms, whilst the king and all the gentlemen of the 
court wore the fiower as "button-holes." The scientific and 
medical notabilities of France were invited to a potato banquet, 
at which the favoured tuber was served cooked in thirty-three 
different ways. 

It is an amazing fact that France, the culinary nation j!;«?* 
excellence, ignored the existence of the potato until the year 
1787, whilst it was generally known and appreciated as art 



868 PBACTICAL GASTRONOMY 

article of diet in England and in Spain long before Parmentier 
was born. Sir Walter Kaleigh introduced it into Ireland from 
Virginia one hundred and fifty years before the tuber made its 
appearance in France. But it made slow progress as an edible, 
and was grown as a curiosity for some time before it attracted 
the attention of the English cultivator and consumer. 

Parmentier died in 1813 at the age of seventy-six, and was 
interred at P^re La Chaise Cemetery. Pound the monument 
erected to his memory is formed a small garden, planted with 
the vegetable he loved and laboured for so much. 

Here is the receipt for Parmentier Potato Soup, or 
Potage Parmentier. 

Peel a dozen potatoes, slice and put them in cold water. 
Slice two onions, a head of celery, and the white part of two 
leeks. Put these ingredients in a stewpan with four ounces of 
butter, and add the potatoes. Fry the whole for ten minutes, 
and then moisten with two quarts of veal broth. Add three 
cloves, a little salt, a bunch of parsley, and let simmer until the 
vegetables are done ; then rub all through a fine sieve. Keturn 
the pur^e into a stewpan ; set it on the fire to boil slowly ; if the 
soup is found too thick, add a little broth. Let it simmer for 
twenty minutes, taking off the scum as it rises. When ready 
to serve, bind it with three yolks of eggs, diluted with a little 
cream, and two ounces of butter divided into small pieces. 
Throw into the soup a little finely-chopped and blanched chervil, 
and serve with some small fried bread croutons. 
The Potato in Prance. 

The Paris correspondent of the Daily News wrote in February 
1887 : — " The potato is not in France that homely esculent that 
it is in the British Islands. There are as many ways of pre- 
paring it here as there were in Goldsmith's time of cooking a 
nettle top. Potatoes are only admitted en robe de chamhre — that 
is to say, in their jackets — to the midday meal, and then on 
unceremonious occasions. They chiefly figure at dejeuners 
intijues, or dejeuners taken at restaurants, where the hifteck aux 
jjommes and la cotelette a la puree de i)oinme de terre are in great 
favour. At popular banquets, where each one who sits down to 
table pays from four to six francs a head, the rosb if is sure to be 
a la Parmentier. The centenary of the adoption of the potato 
as an article of food is to be celebrated next month at Mont- 
didier. There was a universal prejudice against it in this 
tolerant country until Parmentier, the gardener of Louis XVI., 
got that king to admit it to the royal table. As this happened in a 
year of famine, the potato soon after was universally adopted as an 
edible. MM. Erckmann-Chatrian, in one of their patriotic stories, 
describe the effect produced by its advent in Lorraine. MM. De 
Lesseps, Pasteur, and Chevreul, the oldest member of the Institute, 
have promised to attend the potato festival at Montdidier."

" LE CORDON ROUGE." 

This is the title of the grand decoration granted by a society of 
the same name, and is considered " the highest gastronomic 
order in existence." The badge of the order consists of a 
beautifully modelled white-heart cherry, suspended by a cherry- 
red ribbon. The society is ruled by the " Supreme Don," and 
is supported by twelve " Senior Dons." The scope and aims of 
the society are most praiseworthy. Its endeavour is to advance 
not only high-class cookery in all its branches, but also to instruct 
the poorer members of the community how they can utilise 
available food substances to the best advantage. They hope, in 
time to come, to form and establish an "Academic de Cuisine ; " 
another scheme of theirs is to carry out the erection of model 
kitchens for instruction in practical cookery. 
The decoration of the society is open to : — 

1. Ladies who manage their own establishments and are 
celebrated for the excellence of their entertainments. 

2. Cooks of both sexes. 

3. Chemists. 

4. Persons who have invented any valuable article of food or 
drink. 

5. Persons who supply the same. 

6. Proprietors and managers of hotels and other catering 
establishments. 

This order is now governed by six Dons, members of the 
Universal Cookery and Food Association, who, under the guidance 
of the Supreme Don, watch over the interests of the society in 
order to further its objects.

**LE COEDON BLEU." 

Le Cordon bleu, or the blue ribbon, denotes a culinary badge 
of honour, known in France as the highest gastronomic order of 
merit. It consists of a rosette made of dark blue ribbon, and is 
only bestowed on female cooks who are celebrated for the 
excellence of their cooking. 

Culinary etymologists have not yet settled their dispute as to 
the precise derivation of the term " Cordon bleu," as it is applied 
to skilful women cooks. 

The history of its adoption is still a mystery. Some will 
have it that the eminently epicurean monarch Louis XV. was 
so delighted with the dish served up at one of his repasts, under 
the auspices of Madame Du Barry, that he proposed to decorate 
the cook who had prepared the enjoyable feast with the blue 
ribbon of the order of Saint Esprit ; but it is to be feared that 
there is not any more authentic historical foundation for this 
statement than there is for the legend that Charles II. once 
knighted a joint of roast beef, which became then and thereafter 
•' Sir Loin." Others maintain that in the middle of the 
eighteenth century, when restaurants first became popular in 
Paris, these places of entertainment were frequented by attrac- 
tive damsels in Alsatian or in Burgundian costume, who wore 
" Cordons " or scarves of different coloured ribbons. 

These fair Hebes sang songs, played on the flute, and sold fruit 
and cakes. One of the most popular of their number developed a 
genius for the culinary art, and descended to the kitchen to 
cultivate it. Her badge was a ribbon of dark blue tint, which 
circumstance caused her to be known as " Cordon bleu." Be it 
as it may, the controversiahsts on this knotty subject are agreed 
on the most essential point, viz., that the " Cordon bleu " is 
the culinary distinction bestowed on very skilful women cooks.
