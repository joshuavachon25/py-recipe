"PREFACE" 

"Baker's Friend" 

In offering the receipts contained in 
this book, Mr. J. L. Mackenzie feels that 
he is not only aiding the Cake Bakers to 
improve their article, but also helping 
them to attain a leading place in their 
chosen profession. 

The receipts contained herein are the 
results derived by the author from 25 
years of arduous work at the bench. 
Practical as well as theoretical experience. 

Starting as an apprentice in Scotland, 
where he was compelled to work 2 years 
for his employer in the leading Caters 
where he gained invaluable knowledge in 
his chosen profession, later coming to the 
U. S. and working for some of the largest 
caters in this country with great success, 
Mr. Mackenzie was made to feel that he 
owed it to his fellow-workers as well as 
the consuming public, that he publish his 
receipts in book form thereby enabling 
everyone in this profession to get this 
knowledge which cost the author years of 
hard work. 

Mr. Mackenzie prides himself upon his 
ability to produce any Cake in the most 
palatable and salable, and in a more

economical manner than any Cake Baker 
in this country. 

Mr. Mackenzie advises most emphatic- 
ally: Anyone using the receipts con- 
tained herein, that if they are followed 
to the minutest detail, the results will be 
most pleasing as well as profitable. 

In the mixing of Cookies it is fair to 
assume that most Cookie mixtures are 
mixed as follows: Mix or cream together 
sugar and shortening, add the eggs, then 
the milk, seasoning and flavors, stirring 
all together, then sift in flour, baking 
powder or soda and cream of tartar. 

Some of the higher priced goods that 
are sold by the pound are mixed differ- 
ently. 

These Cookie Mixtures in Baker's 
Friend will enable the beginner as well as 
the practical baker to turn out an up-to- 
date variety of Cookies.

AMERICAN PUFF PASTE 
2 lbs. of butter washed in ice water and 
2 lbs. flour, 2 oz. baking powder. Rub 
all together, add 2 eggs and enough ice 
water to make a smooth paste, roll out 
about 20 inches long and 10 inches wide 
turn in the ends to meet in center and 
fold again, let rest for an hour, repeat 
this until rolled four times, for Pattie shells 
and tarts, roll to Ya inch thick and place 
on clean pans and let rest a while before 
baking,now take small tube or biscuit 
cutter and press in the center of each 
pattie, down to near the bottom of the 
paste, bake in 350 degree oven. When 
baked cut out the center and fill, this 
paste is very valuable for the American 
baker or cook, while it takes a great deal 
more time and experience to make these 
so called French Puff Paste.

PUFF PASTE AND PASTRIES 

The making of this paste is an art 
which requires close observation of cer- 
tain rules, and long practice. The paste 
consists of a series of layers of dough on 
butter and to produce these layers evenly, 
and without breaking, is one of the prin- 
cipal factors in the production of a per- 
fect paste. 

When using all butter it is necessary to 
wash the butter in cold water to remove 
the salt. The water for mixing into puff 
paste should be thoroughly iced before 
using. 

To 6 lbs flour rub in 2 lbs. butter, 2 
oz. cream of tartar, now add juice of 4 
lemons and enough ice water to make a 
firm paste The paste then should be set 
aside for Yl hour to lose its spring. Nov/ 
flatten down dough and 4 lbs. well 
washed butter, place butter in center of 
dough and cover with paste. Roll out 
paste three times as long as it is wide, 
about Yl inch thick. Fold from ends 
about y^ from the center, fold again both 
sides again so as to meet in one center, 
then fold over top, this is considered one 
roll. Faste then should be put aside on 
ice for an hour, and again given three 
more turns with an hour apart. After 
the last roll it is not advisable to hurry 
puff paste, giving it too many foldings at 

33 



one time, a rest between turns, produces 
the unbroken layer necessary for good 
paste. When making puff paste, that 
is not to be used the same day it is best 
not to finish the rolling but to give it 
the last turn the day it is used. Patties 
shell tarts and pastries of all kinds should 
have straight sharp cut edges. Dull cut- 
ters push the layers of paste into each 
other, and prevents rising. Putting the 
cut pieces upside down on pans, prevents 
this to some extent, and makes them rise 
better. A good even heat is required 
for baking of all kinds of pastries. If 
oven is too hot especially for large past- 
ries the crust is found too quickly, not 
giving time enough for the paste to ex- 
pand and rise fully. All pastries should 
be washed on top with egg wash, for a 
brighter gloss. The pastries may be 
brushed over with a thick syrup while ho':. 

NO. 2 

For a cheaper puff paste the following 
may be used: 

6 lbs. bread flour, rub in 

I lb. compound then add 

1 pt. vinegar, juice of 3 lemons and 
enough water to make a softer dough 
than in No. 1 . paste Then roll in 

4 lbs. Oleomargarine, the same as No. I . 

The cake mixtures in this book are 
34 



money makers to any baker in the busi- 
ness today. I know of a large market in 
New York City that does over a Hundred 
thousand dollar business a year with the 
mixtures in Bakers Friend. A great 
many of the bakers whom I have met in 
my travels have the habit of not properly 
seasoning their mixtures with either salt 
or flavors. 

My advice to the bakers is to try a com- 
bination of flavors in some of their mix- 
tures which you will find give a very 
satisfactory palatable eating code. In 
placing your goods in store for sale don't 
forget that neatness and cleanliness is the 
best ad you can get. 

FRENCH PASTRY 

In making French pastry some base is 
chosen which in combination with other 
tasty substances, makes the popular 
pastry. 

The following mixture, makes a very 
good light base from which a large variety 
can be made. 

4 lbs. sugar 

3 qts. whole eggs 

1 Vi pt. yolks 

2 J/2 lbs. melted butter 

3 lbs flour

HOW TO MIX

per kettle, while beating, heat to about 
98 degrees or blood heat. Remove from 
fire and continue beating, until the mix- 
ture has a consistency of sponge cake 
froth, gradually sift in flour and corn

mixed, pour in melted butter. This mix-
