PEEFACE. 



Virginia, or the Old Dominion, as her children delight to 
call her, has always been famed for the style of her living. 
Taught by the example of her royal colonial governors, and 
the numerous adherents of King Charles, who brought hither 
in their exile the graces and luxuriousness of his brilliant 
court, she became noted among the colonies for the princely 
hospitality of her people and for the beauty and richness of their 
living. But when at length her great son in the House of 
Burgesses sounded the cry of war, and her people made haste 
to gird themselves for the long struggle, her daughters, not to 
be outdone either in services or patriotism, set about at once 
the inauguration of a plan of rigid retrenchment and reform in 
the domestic economy, while at the same time exhibiting to 
their sisters a noble example of devotion and self-sacrifice. 

Tearing the glittering arms of King George from their side- 
boards, and casting them, with their costly plate and jewels, as 
offerings into the lap of the Continental Congress, they intro- 
duced in their homes that new style of living in which, discard- 
ing all the showy extravagance of the old, and retaining only 



Vlll PREFACE. 

its inexpensive graces, they succeeded in perfecting that system 
which, surviving to this day, has ever been noted for its beau- 
tiful and elegant simplicity. 

This system, which combines the thrifty frugality of New 
England with the less rigid style of Carolina, has been justly 
pronounced, by the throngs of admirers who have gathered from 
all quarters of the Union around the generous boards of her 
illustrious sons, as the very perfection of domestic art. 

It is the object of the compiler of this book, for she does not 
claim the title of author, to bring within the reach of every 
American housekeeper who may desire it, the domestic prin- 
ciples and practices of these famous Virginia homes. In doing 
this she has not sought to pursue the plan adopted by so many 
authors of such books — to depend upon her own authorship for 
her rule. She confesses that in this matter her labors have 
been largely editorial. 

Through a long life it has been her good fortune to be a fre- 
quent visitor, and often the intimate guest and kinswoman, at 
many of these homes ; and she has sought, by the opportunities 
thus afforded, and guided by her own extensive experience as a 
housekeeper, to gather and select from these numerous sources 
those things which seemed to her best and most useful to the 
practical housewife, and which, carefully observed, would bring 
the art within reach of all who have the ambition to acquire it. 

It will be seen that she is indebted to near 250 contributors 
to her book. Among these will be found many names famous 



PEEFACE. IX 

through the land. Associated with them will be discovered 
others of less national celebrity, but who have acquired among 
their neighbors an equally merited distinction for the beautiful 
order and delightful cuisine of their homes. 

The labors of the writer have been greatly lightened by the 
kindness of these contributors. And she desires in this public 
■way to renew her thanks for the aid which they have given her, 
but even more for the goodness which prompts them, at cost of 
their sensitiveness, to allow her to append their names to the 
recipes which they furnish. 

The book, after great care in its preparation, is now offered 
to the public with much confidence. All that is here presented 
has been so thoroughly tested, and approved by so many of the 
best housekeepers in Virginia, that she feels it must meet with 
a cordial and very general reception at the hands of all accom- 
plished housewives throughout the land, and will supply a long- 
felt and real need. 

If she shall thus succeed in disseminating a knowledge of the 
practice of the most admirable system of domestic art known in 
our country y if she shall succeed in lightening the labors of the 
housewife by placing in her reach a guide which will be found 
always trusty and reliable / if she shall thus make her tasks 
lighter and home-life sweeter ; if she shall succeed in contribut- 
ing something to the health of American children by instruct- 
ing their mothers in the art of preparing light and wholesome 
and palatable food ; if she, above all, shall succeed in making 

American homes more attractive to American husbands^ and spare

them a resort to hotels and saloons for those simple luxuries which 
thei/r wives know not how to provide j if she shall thus add to the 
comfort, to the health and happy contentment of these, she will 
have proved in some measure a public benefactor, and will feel 
amply repaid for all the labor her work has cost.

HOUSEKEEPING IN OLD VIRGINIA. 



BREAD. 

Bread is so vitally important an element in our nonrisliment 
that T have assigned to it the first place in my work. Trnly, as 
Frederika Bremer says, " when the bread rises in the oven, the 
heart of the housewife rises with it," and she might have added 
that the heart of the housewife sinks in sympathy with the 
sinking bread. 

I would say to housewives, be not daunted by one failure, nor 
by twenty. Besolve that you will have good bread, and never 
cease striving after this result till you have effected it. If per- 
sons without brains can accomplish this, why cannot you ? I 
would recommend that the housekeeper acquire the practice as 
well as the theory of bread-making. In this way, she will be 
able to give more exact directions to her cook and to more 
readily detect and rectify any blemish in the bread. Besides, if 
circumstances should throw her out of a cook for a short time, 
she is then prepared for the emergency. In this country 
fortunes are so rapidly made and lost, the vicissitudes of life 
are so sudden, that we know not what a day may bring forth. 
It is not uncommon to see elegant and refined women brought 
suddenly face to face with emergencies which their practical 
knowledge of household economy and their brave hearts enable 
them to firmly meet and overcome. 

To return to the bread question, however. Good flour is an 
indispensable requisite to good bread. Flour, whether old or 



20 BEEAD. 

new, should always be sunned and aired before being used. In 
the morning, get out the flour to be made up at night for next 
morning's breakfast. Sif fc it in a tray and put it out in the sun, 
or, if the day is damp, set it near the kitchen fire. Only experi- 
ence will enable you to be a good judge of flour. One test is to 
rub the dry flour between your fingers, and if the grains feel 
round, it is a sign that the flour is good. If after trying a 
barrel of flour twice, you find it becomes wet and sticky, after 
being made up of the proper consistency, you had better then 
return it to your grocer. 

The best flour is worthless without good yeast. Yeast made 
up in the morning ought to be fit for use at night. It should 
be foamy and frothy, with a scent slightly like ammonia. After 
closely following the directions for yeast-making, given in the 
subsequent pages, the bread will be apt to succeed, if the flour 
employed is good. 

There is a great art in mixing bread, and it is necessary to 
observe a certain rotation in the process. To make a small 
quantity of bread, first sift one quart of flour ; into that sift a 
teaspoonful of salt, next rub in an Irish potato, boiled and 
mashed fine, then add a piece of lard the size of a walnut, and 
next a half teacup of yeast in which three teaspoonfuls of 
white sugar have been stirred. (Under no circumstances use 
soda or saleratus in your light dough.) Then make into a soft 
dough with cold water in summer, and lukewarm in winter. 
Knead without intermission for half an hour, hy the clock 
Otherwise five minutes appear to be a half hour when bread is 
being kneaded or beaten. Then place it in a stone crock, greased 
with lard at the bottom, and set it to rise. In summer, apply no 
artificial heat to it, but set it in a cool place. As bread rises 
much more quickly in summer than in winter, you must make 
allowance for this difierence, during the respectivo seasons. 
The whole process, including both the first and second lising, may 
be accomplished in seven or eight hours in summer, though this 
will be regulated partly by the flour, as some kinds of flour rise 



BREAD. 21 

much more quickly than others. In summer you may make it 
up at nine o'clock P.M., for an eight o'clock breakfast next 
morning, but in winter, make it up at seven p. m. , and then set it 
on a shelf under which a lighted coal-oil lamp is placed. If you 
can have a three-cornered shelf of slate or sheet-iron, placed in a 
corner of the kitchen, j ust above the bread block, it will be all 
the better, though a common wooden shelf, made very thin, will 
answer, where you cannot get the other. The coal-oil lamp 
underneath without running the risk of burning the shelf (if 
wooden), will keep the bread gently heated all night, and will 
answer the double purpose of keeping a light burning, which 
most persons like to do at night, and which they can do with 
scarcely any expense, by using a coal-oil lamp. 

Never knead bread a second time in the morning, as this 
ruins it. Handle lightly as possible, make into the desired 
shapes and put into the moulds in which it is to be baked. 
Grease your hands before doing this, so as to grease the loaf or 
each roll as you put it in, or else dip a feather in lard and pass 
lightly over the bread just before putting it in the oven to 
bake. Let it be a little warmer during the second rise than 
during the first. Always shape and put in the moulds two 
hours before breakfast. If hot bread is desired for dinner, re- 
serve part of the breakfast dough, keeping it in the kitchen in 
winter, and in the refrigerator in summer till two hours before 
dinner. 

In baking, set the bread on the floor of the stove or range, 
never on the shelf. Always turn up the damper before baking 
any kind of bread. As you set the bread in the stove, lay a 
piece of stiff writing paper over it to keep it from browning be- 
fore heating through. Leave the door ajar a few minutes, then 
remove the paper and shut the door. When the top of the loa* 
is a light amber color, put back the paper that the bread may 
not brown too much while thoroughly baking. Turn-*he mould 
around so that each part may be exposed to equal heat. Have 
an empty baking-pan on the shelf above the bread, to prevent it 



22 BEEAD. 

from blistering : some persons fill tlie pan with water, but I think 
this is a bad plan, as the vapor injures the bread. When thor- 
oughly done, wrap the bread a few moments in a clean, thick, 
oread towel and send to the table with a napkin over it, to be 
kept on till each person has taken his seat at table. 

I would suggest to housekeepers to have made at a tinner's, 
a sheet-iron shape for bread, eight inches long, four and one-half 
inches wide, and five and one-half deep. This is somewhat like 
a brickbat in shape, only deeper, and is very desirable for bread 
that is to be cut in slices, and also for bread that is to be pulled 
off in slices. A quart of flour will make eight large rolls, six 
inches high, for this mould, and three or four turnovers. It is a 
nice plan after making out the eight rolls to roll them with 
greased hands till each one will reach across the pan (four and 
one-half inches), making eight slices of bread which will pull off 
beautifully when well done, and thus save the task of slicing 
with a knife. It requires an hour to bake this bread properly. 

Do not constantly make bread in the same shapes : each 
morning, try to have some variation. Plain light bread dough 
may be made into loaves, rolls, twist, turnovers, light biscuit, 
etc., and these changes of shape make a pleasant and appetizing 
variety in the appearance of the table. The addition of three 
eggs to plain light bread dough will enable you to make French 
rolls, muffins, or Sally-Lunn of it. As bread is far more appe- 
tizing, baked in pretty shapes, I would suggest the snow-ball 
shape for muffins and egg bread. Yery pretty iron shapes 
(eight or twelve in a group, joined together) may be procured 
from almost any tinner. 

If you should have indifferent flour of which you cannot get 
rid, bear in mind that it will sometimes make excellent beaten 
biscuit when it will not make good light bread. In making 
beaten buscuit, always put one teaspoonful of salt, a piece of lard 
the size of an egg, and a teacup of milk to a quart of flour, 
adding enough cold water to make a stifl" doagh : no other 
ingredients are admissible. Make the dough much stifler than 



BREAD. 23 

for other breads, beat steadily a half hour, hy the clock. Cut with 
a biscuit cutter or shape by hand, being careful to have the 
shape of each alike and perfect. Make them not quite half an 
inch thick, as they rise in baking. Do not let them touch each 
other in the pan, and let the oven be very hot. It is well not 
to have beaten biscuit and light bread baked at the same time, 
as they require different degrees of heat. When two kinds of 
bread are required, try to have two such as require the same 
amount of heat. Egg bread and corn muffins require the same 
degree of heat as beaten biscuit, while Sally-Lunn and muffins 
need the same as light bread. 

There is no reason why the poor man should not have as well 
prepared and palatable food as the wealthy, for, by care and 
pains, the finest bread may be made of the simplest materials, 
and surely the loving hands of the poor man's wife and daughter 
will take as much pains to make his bread nice and light as hire- 
lings will do for the wealthy. The mistake generally made by per- 
sons in restricted circumstances is to make too great a use of soda 
bread, which is not only less wholesome, but is more expensive 
than light bread or beaten biscuit, as it requires more ingredi- 
ents. The bread, coffee and meat, which constitute the poor 
man's breakfast, properly cooked, furnish a meal fit for a prince. 

The furnishing of the kitchen is so important that I must here 
say a few words on the subject. First, the housekeeper must 
have a good stove or range, and it is well for her to have the 
dealer at hand when it is put up, to see that it draws well. 
Besides the utensils furnished with the range or stove, she must 
provide every kitchen utensil needed in cooking. She must 
have a kitchen safe, — a bread block in the corner, furnished 
with a heavy iron beater ; trays, sifters (with iron rims) steam- 
ers, colanders, a porcelain preserving kettle, perforated skim- 
mers and spoons, ladles, long-handled iron forks and spoons, 
sharp knives and skewers, graters, egg beaters (the Dover is 
the best), plenty of extra bread pans, dippers and tins of every 
kind, iron moulds for egg bread and muffins, waah pans, tea 



24 BEEAD. 

towels, bread towels, and hand towels, plates, knives, forks and 
spoons for use of the servants, a pepper box, salt box and 
dredge box (filled), a match safe, and last, but not least, a clock. 
Try as far as possible to have the utensils of metal, rather than 
of wood. In cases where you cannot have cold and hot water 
conveyed into the kitchen, always keep on the stove a kettle of 
hot water, with a clean rag in it, in which all greasy dishes and 
kitchen utensils may be washed before being rinsed in the kitchen 
wash pan. Always keep your cook well supplied with soap, 
washing mops and coarse linen dish rags. I have noticed that if 
you hem the latter, servants are not so apt to throw them away. 
Insist on having each utensil cleaned immediately after being 
used. Have shelves and proper places to put each article, 
hooks to hang the spoons on, etc. If you cannot have an oil- 
cloth on your kitchen floor, have it oiled and then it may be 
easily and quickly wiped over every morning. Once a week, 
have the kitchen and every article in it thoroughly cleaned. 
First clean the pipe of the stove, as the dust, soot and ashes fly 
over the kitchen and soil everything. Then take the stove to 
pieces, as far as practicable, cleaning each part, especially the 
bottom, as neglect of this will prevent the bread from baking 
well at the bottom. After the stove is thoroughly swept out, — 
oven and all, apply stove polish. I consider " Crumbs of Com- 
fort " the best preparation for this purpose. It comes in small 
pieces, each one of which is sufficient to clean the stove once, 
and is thus less apt to be wasted or thrown away by servants thaB 
stove polish that comes in a mass. Next remove everything 
from the kitchen safe and shelves, which must be scoured before

first be scoured, scalded, and wiped dry. Then wash the win-

emergency during the night. Have kindling wood at hand also^ 
so that a iire may be quickly made, if needed. 

Sometimes a discoloration is observable in iron kettles or 
other iron vessels. This may be avoided by filling them with 
hay before using them. Pour water over the hay, set the ves- 
sel on the fire and let it remain till the water boils. After this, 
Bcour in sand and ashes — then wash in hot soap-suds, after 
v^^hich process, there will be no danger of discoloration.

YEAST. 

Boil one quart of Irish potatoes in three quarts of water. 
When done, take out the potatoes, one by one, on a fork, peel 
and mash them fine, in a tray, with a large iron spoon, leaving 
the boiling water on the stove during tlie process. Throw in 
this water a handful of hops, which must scald, not boil, as it 
turns the tea very dark to let the hops boil.

26 IRISH POTATO YEAST YEAST THAT NEVER FAILS. 

Add to the mashed potatoes a heaping teacupful of powdered 
white sugar and half a teacupful of salt ; then slowly stir in the 
strained hop tea, so that there will be no lumps. When milk- 
warm add a teacupful of yeast and pour into glass fruit jars, or 
large, clear glass bottles, to ferment, being careful not to close 
them tightly. Set in a warm place in winter, a cool one in sum- 
mer. In six hours it will be ready for use, and at the end of 
that time the jar or bottle must be securely closed. Keep in a 
cold room in winter, and in the refrigerator in summer. This 
yeast will keep two weeks in winter and one week in summer. 
Bread made from it is always sweet. — Mrs. S. T.

ALUM YEAST LEAVEN. 27 

Then take out and mash the potatoes, and throw into the 
water three handfuls of hops. 

When the hops have boiled to a good tea, strain the water 
over the potatoes, a small quantity at a time, mixing them well 
together. 

Add one teacup of brown sugar. 

1 teacup of salt. 

1 tablespoonful of ground ginger. 

When milk-warm, add yeast of the same sort to make it rise. 

Put it in bottles, or a jug, leaving it uncorked for a day. 

Set it in a cool place. 

Put two large tablespoonfuls of it to a quart of flour, and 
when making up, boil a potato and mix with it. 

This yeast never sours, and is good as long as it lasts. — 3frs.

Alum Yeast. 

On one pint of flour pour enough boiling water to make a 
thick batter, stirring it until perfectly smooth, and then let it 
stand till milk-warm. 

Then add a teaspoonful of powdered alum. 
1 teaspoonful of salt. 
1 tablespoonful of sugar. 
Half a teacup of yeast. 
After it ferments, add enough meal to make it a stiff dough. 
Let it stand till it works, and then spread it in the shade to 
dry. 

To a quart of flour put a tablespoonful of crumbs. — Mrs. P, 

Leaven. 

2 tablespoonfuls of flour. 

1 tablespoonful of lard or butter. 

2 tablespoonfuls of yeast. 
2 eggs. 

1 potato. 

2 teaspoonfuls of sugar. 



28 EXCELLENT BEEAD FOE BEEAKFAST. 

Make the leaven soon after breakfast in winter, and at one 
o'clock p. M. in summer. Let it be of the consistency of bat- 
ter. Put it in a small bucket, in a warm place, to rise till four 
o'clock p. M. This amount of leaven is sufficient for two quarts 
of flour. If for loaf bread, leave out the eggs and butter. — 
Mrs. 31. 

Excellent Bread for Breakfast. 

1 quart of flour. 

Lard the size of a walnut. 

1 small Irish potato, boiled and mashed fine. 

1 heaping teaspoonful of salt. 

Half a teacup of good yeast, into which put a tablespoonful 
of white sugar. 

Make up a soft dough with cold water in summer and milk- 
warm water in winter. This must be kneaded for thirty min- 
utes, and then set to rise, in a cool place in summer, and a warm 
one in winter; must never be kept more than milk warm. 

Two hours before breakfast, make the dough into the desired 
shapes, handling it lightly, without kneading it, first rubbing 
lard over the hands, and taking especial care to grease the 
bread on top. Then set it to rise again. 

Thirty minutes are sufficient for baking it, unless it be in the 
form of a loaf or rolls, in which case, it must be baked fifteen 
minutes longer. Excellent muffins may be made by tlie above 
receipt, adding two eggs well beaten, so that from the same 
batch of dough both plain bread and muffins may be made. 

Iron moulds are best for baking. 

For those who prefer warm bread for dinner, it is a good 
plan to reserve a portion of the breakfast dough, setting it 
away in a cool place till two hours before dinner, then make 
into turnovers or twist, set it to rise and bake it for dinner, as 
for breakfast. Yery nice on a cold day, and greatly preferable 
to warmed-over bread. — Mrs. aS. T. 



family bread — old vikginia loaf bread. 29 

Recipe for Family Bread. 

2 quarts of flour. 
2 tablespoonfuls of lard or butter. 
2 teaspoonfuls of salt. 

Enough sponge for a two- quart loaf of bread. 
Mix with one pint of sweet milk. 
Make into rolls and bake with very little fire under the oven. 
—3Irs. A. G. 

Loaf Bread. 

First make a batter of the following ingredients. 
1 pint of flour. 
1 teaspoonful of salt. 
1 teaspoonful of sugar. 
A cup of water. 
A cup of good yeast. 
Set this to rise and when risen work in two pints of flour, 
or, if the batter is not sufficient to work up this flour, add a 
little water. 

Work it smoothly and set it to rise. 

When risen, add a small piece of lard, work it well again, 
let it stand an hour and then bake it slowly. — 3frs. J*. W. 

Old Virginia Loaf Bread.

into it 

1 teaspoonful of brown sugar. 
1 tablespoonful of sweet lard. 

Then add three tablespoonfuls of good hop yeast. 

Mix the ingredients thoroughly, then put the sponge in a 
mug with a close-fitting top, and let it stand several hours to 
rise. 

Sift into the tray three pints of the best family flour, to which

add a teaspoonful of salt. Then pour in the sponge and add 
enough cold water to the flour to work it up into a rather stifl' 
dough. Knead it till the dough is smooth, then let it stand all 
night to rise. Work it over in the morning, using just enough 
flour to keep it from sticking to the hands. Allow it one hour 
to rise before baking and one hour to bake in a moderate oven. 
Then it will be thoroughly done and well dried. 

Use a little lard on the hands when making out the loaf, as 
it keeps the crust from being too hard. — Mrs. S. 

Another Hecipe for Loaf 3read. 

Good flour is the first requisite, and next, good yeast and 
sufficient kneading. 

For a loaf of ordinary size, use 
2 lbs. of flour. 
Lard the size of a hen's egg. 
A saltspoonful of salt. 
2 gills of yeast. 

Mix up these ingredients into a moderately stiflT dough, using 
for the purpose, from three gills to a pint of water. Some flour 
being more adhesive than others, you have to learn by experi- 
ence the exact amount of water required. 

Knead the dough till perfectly smooth, then set it to rise, in 
a cool place, in summer, but in a warm place, free from draughts, 
in winter. In the latter season it is better to keep a blanket 
wrapped around it. 

This amount of flour will rise to the top of a gallon and a 
half jar or bucket. If it is ready before time, stir it down and 
set it in a cooler place. 

When you put it in the baking-pan (in which it will be in 
an inch of the top, if the pan be of a suitable size for the 
amount of flour) cover it well, or a hard crust will form from 
the efi'ects of the atmosphere. Keep it a little warmer during 
the second rise than during the first. When ready for baking, 
set it in the oven and bake it for three-quarters of an hour with

out, about five inches long, then turn it about half over. "When 
you have made up all the dough, in shapes like this, place them 
on a dish or board, cover with a napkin and set aside for a 
second rising. When ready to bake, dip a feather in water and 
pass over them to prevent the crust being too hard. If the 
dough should be sour, knead in a little soda, which will correct 

it— Mrs. A. C.

COFFEE, TEA, AND CHOCOLATE. 

To TOAST Coffee. 

Wash and pick the coffee, put it in a very large stove-pan in 
a hot oven. Stir often, giving constant attention. It must be 
toasted the darkest brown, yet not one grain must be burned. 
It should never be glazed, as this destroys the aroma. 

Two pints of coffee become three pints after toasting. — Mrs. 
S. T, 

Boiled Coffee. 
To one quart of boiling water (poured in after scalding the 
pot) stir in three gills of coffee, not ground too fine. Boil 



62 COFFEE. 

twenty minutes, scraping from the sides and stirring occasion 
ally. Five minutes before breakfast, scrape from the spout, 
pour out half a teacupful, and return to the pot. Do this a 
second time. Set it with the side of the pot to the fire, so that 
it will be just' at the boiling point. Do not let it boil, however. 
Serve in the same coffee-pot. 

Coffee should never be glazed. 

Have a liberal supply of thick, sweet cream, also of boiled 
milk, to serve with the coffee. 

If the members of the family drop in at intervals, it is well 
to keep the coffee over a round iron weight, heated just enough 
to keep the coffee hot, without boiling it. This answers better 
than a spirit lamp for keeping coffee hot. — 3frs. JS. T. 

Coffee, 

Take equal quantities of Mocha, Java, Laguayra and Rio 
coffee. Have the coffee roasted a chestnut brown. To every 
twelve cups of coffee to be drawn, use eighteen heaping table- 
spoons of the ground coffee. Have the water boiling hot, scald 
the biggin or percolator, put the ground coffee in the upper 
part, then pour on some boiling water for it to draw — about 
two teacups if you are to make twelve cups of coffee. Let it 
stand a few moments and pour again into the upper part of the 
percolator the first drawn coffee. Then add, one by one, the 
cups of boiling water required. It will take ten minutes for 
the coffee to be ready for the table.

Green Tea. 
Scald the teapot. If you wish a pint of tea, put in one heap- 
ing teaspoonful tea after putting in a pint boiling water. Set 
this where it will keep hot, but not quite boil. — Mrs. 8. T. 

A good Cup of Green Tea. 

Before putting in any water, set the teapot with the tea in it 
before the fire and let it get thoroughly hot. Then fill the pot 
with boiling water and let it stand five minutes. — Mrs. M. JS.

Iced Tea. 

After scalding the teapot, put into it one quart of boiling 
water and two teaspoonfuls green tea. If wanted for supper, 
do this at breakfast. At dinner time, strain, without stirring, 
through a tea-strainer into a pitcher. Let it stand till tea time 
and then pour into decanters, leaving the sediment in the bottom 
of the pitcher. Fill the goblets with ice, put two teaspoonfuls 
granulated sugar in each, and pour the tea over the ice and 
sugar. A squeeze of lemon will make this delicious and 
healthful, as it will correct the astringent tendency. — Mrs*

MILK AND BUTTER. 

The most exquisite nicety and care must be observed in the 
management of milk and butter. A housekeeper should have 
i?wo sets of milk vessels (tin or earthenware, never stoneware, 
as this is an absorbent). She should never use twice in succes 



66 MILK AND BUTTER. 

sion the same milk vessels without having them scalded and 
aired. 

In warm weather, sweet milk should be set on ice, if practi- 
cable, or if not, in a spring-house. Never put ice in sweet milk, 
as this dilutes it. One pan of milk should always be set aside 
to raise cream for coflee. A bucket with a close-fitting lid should 
be filled with milk and set aside for dinner, one for supper, one 
for breakfast, and a fourth for cooking purposes. 

For making butter, strain unskimmed milk into a scalded 
churn, where the churning is done daily. This will give sweeter 
butter and nicer buttermilk than when cream is skimmed and 
kept for churning, as this sometimes gives a cheesy taste to the 
butter. Do not let the milk in the churn exceed blood heat. 
If overheated, the butter will be white and frothy, and the milk 
thin and sour. Churn as soon as the milk is turned. In sum- 
mer try to churn early in the morning, as fewer flies are swarm- 
ing then, and the butter can be made much firmer. 

A stone churn is in some respects more convenient than a 
wooden churn ; but no matter which you use, the most fastidi- 
ous neatness must be observed. Have the churn scalded and 
set out to sun as soon as possible after churning. Use your last 
made butter for buttering bread, reserving the staler for cookery. 

Butter should be printed •early in the morning, while it is 
cool. A plateful for each of the three meals should be placed 
in the refrigerator ready for use. Do not set butter in a re- 
frigerator with anything else in it but milk, or in a safe with 
anything but milk. It readily imbibes the flavor of everything 
near it. After churning, butter should be taken up in what is 
called " a piggin," first scalded and then filled with cold water. 
With an old-fashioned butter-stick (scalded) wash and press the 
butter till no water is left. Then add a little salt, finely beaten. 
Beat again in a few hours, and make up in half-pound prints. 
I would advise all housekeepers (even those who do not make 
their own butter) to keep a piggin, a butter-stick, and a pretty 
butt a-print. 



TO SECURE NICE BUTTER FOB THE TAJBLE IN WINTER. 67 

To secnire nice Sutter for the Table in Winter. 

In October and November, engage butter to be brought 
sveeklj, fresh from the churn in rolls. Wrap each roll in a 
piece of old table cloth, and put in a sweet firkin or stone jtu* 
wliich has been washed with soda water, scalded and .sunned 
for a month before using. Pour over it a clear strong brine, 
which also must have been prepared at least a week before- 
hand, by pouring off the settlings and repeated strainings. 
Have a nice fiat rock washed and weight the butter down with 
it, being careful to keep it always under the brine. — Mrs. 
8. T. 

Recipe for Putting up JButter 

2 quarts best common salt. 
1 ounce pulverized saltpetre. 
1 ounce white sugar. 

Work the butter over three times, the last time adding an 
ounce of the above mixture to every pound butter. Of course, 
the butter is salted, when first made. Make the butter into 
rolls and wrap in cloths or pack in jars, within four inches of 
the top of each jar. If the latter is done, fill the jars with 
brine and tie up closely. If the former is preferred, drop the 
rolls into brine, pi-epared as follows : 

To every gallon brine that will bear an egg^ add one pound 
white sugar and one-half ounce saltpetre. Boil well and skim. 
Keep the brine closely covered. I have used butter on my 
table in May, put up in this way, and it tasted as well as when 
put up in October. — 3Irs. JR. G. 

Clabber. 
To have clabber in perfection, place in small glass dishes or 
bowls enough milk to make clabber for each person. After it 
has turned, set it in the refrigerator, if in summer, till called 
for. By the way, refrigerators (as well as water- coolers) should 
be washed every morning with water in which a tablespoonful 



6S COTTAGE CHEESE — SOTJP. 

of common soda has been dissolved. They shouhl then be aired 
before filling with ice for the day. — Mrs. S. T. 

Cottage Cheese. 
When the tea-kettle boils, pour the water into a pan of " lop- 
pered " milk. It will curd at once. Stir it and turn it into a 
colander, pour a little cold water over it, salt it and break it 
up. A better way is to put equal parts of buttermilk and 
thick milk in a kettle, over the fire, heat it almost boiling hot, 
pour into a linen bag and let it drain till next day. Then take 
it out, salt it, put in a little cream or butter, as it may be thick 
or not, and make it up into balls the size of an orange. 



SOUP. 
As making soup is a tedious process, it is best to make 
enough at once to last several days. Beef shank is most gen- 
erally used in making nutritious soup. It is best to get this 
the day before using it, and soak it all night in cold, clear water. 
If you cannot do this, however, get it as early in the morning 
as you can. Break the bones, wash it, soak it a few minutes in 
weak salt and water, and put it in a large boiler of cold water. 
As soon as it begins to simmer, remove the dark scum that 
rises on top. Keep the boiler closely covered, and boil very 
slowly till an hour or two before dinner. Then, with a ladle, 
remove all the fat from the top, as it is this element that makes 
soup unwholesome. Strain and season, or, if you prefer, season 
just enough for one meal, reserving the rest as foundation for 
another sort of soup. It is well always to keep some of this 
stock on hand in cold weather, as by the addition of a can of 
tomatoes, or other ingredients, a delicious soup may be quickly 
made of it. Never throw away water in which any sort of meat 



OYSTEIi SOUP ECONOMICAL OYSTEB SOUP. 69 

has been boiled, as it is mucb better to simmer bash or a stew 
in this liquor than in water, and it is also invaluable for bast- 
ing fowls or meats that have not been parboiled. 

Directions for soup making are so fully given in the follow^ 
ing pages that it is needless for me to say anything further on 
the subject here. 

/ Oyster Soup. 

100 oysters. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

1 tablespoonful black pepper. 

^ pound butter. 

Yolks of 3 eggs. 

1 pint rich milk, perfectly fresh. 

3 tablespoonfuls flour. 
Separate the oysters from the liquor : put the liquor to boil, 
when boiled add salt, pepper and butter, then the flour, having 
pi-eviously made it into a batter. Stir all the time. When it 
comes to a boil, add the eggs well beaten, then the milk, and 
when the mixture reaches a boil, put in the oysters ; let them 
also just boil, and the soup is done. Stir all the time to pre- 
vent curdling. — 3frs. Jiidge M.

^ Oyster Soup. 

Empty tlio oysters into a colander and drain ojff all the liquor ; 
tlien strain the liquor through a very coarse cloth to rid it of 
all scum, etc. To a whole can of oysters take a quart of milk 

Put the milk, oyster liquor, one level tablespoonful flour 
rubbed very smooth with one heaping tablespoonful of butter, 
one tablespoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful pepper, all on the 
fire together in a farina-boiler (or put a skillet one-third filled 
with boiling water under the saucepan, to prevent the milk 
burning). When it comes to a boil, put in the oysters and let 
them stew for twenty minutes or till the gill of the oyster turns 
and begins to ruffle and crimp at the edge. Serve immediately, 
for if they are cooked too long, they become hard, dark and 
tasteless. If you put the salt in last, it will not curdle the 
soup. Some add one level teaspoonful whole cloves and same 
of mace, tied up in a net bag, but they are little improvement. —

Sassafras Gumbo is made in the same way, except after the 
fowl has boiled until the flesh has left the bone, just before taking 
off the fire, stir in one tablespoonful sassafras flour. Oysters 
are a great improvement to sassafras gumbo. Gather the sassa- 
fras leaves green, and dry in the shade, as sage ; when thoroughly 
dry, rub through a sieve and bottle and cork tightly. It is 
nice in beef soup instead of okra. — Mrs. T.

Stewed Oysters. 
Take one-quarter pound nice butter, put it in a pan and melt, 
then pepper and salt, add a small piece of cheese. When it is 
all melted add one pint of oyster liquor, and boil ; when hot, 
strain and put back in pan, then add oysters and boil five min- 
utes.— Jfr. K. N, 

Stewed Oysters. 

Pour into a stew-pan ^ gallon oysters, 
2 tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar. 
1 teaspoonful black pepper. 
1 teaspoonful salt. 
Let them simmer until the oysters are plump ; take them out 
with a fork and drop them into a tureen, on a handful of crack- 
ers and three heaping tablespoonfuls fresh butter. 

Pour one pint milk to the liquor, let it boil up and strain it 
on the oysters. Rinse out the stew-^an and pour the oysters, 
liquor, etc., back into it, and set it on the fire. When it comes

Put into tlie kettle one pint liquor, one-half pound butter, 
and pepper. 

Let it boil, then put in the oysters, after draining them in a 
colander. They will be done as soon as they boil up, or when 
they curl right well. When ready to take up, add half tea- 
cup cracker crumbs and a little salt in the stew. — Mrs. JP. Wl 

To Stew Oysters. 

Put into a shallow stew-pan the oysters. As soon as the gills 
begin to open pour off all the liquor. Continue to cook them, 
stirring all the time until done. The liquor that was poured 
off must be thickened with a good lump of butter rubbed up 
with flour, and seasoned with pepper and salt, and poured boil- 
ing-hot onto the oysters. 

The advantage of this way of cooking is that the oysters 
become large and plump. — Jfrs. Dr. JE. H.

too fine, or it will be clammy. 

■^ teacupful cream. 

2 great spoonfuls butter. 

Salt and pepper. 
Oysters part with a great deal of moisture in cooking, and if 
the mixture is too wet it is not as good ; it should be rather drjf 
when done. Cover the bottom of a well-buttered dish with a 
layer of very dry bread crumbs, dust over a little salt and pep- 
per, and stick little bits of butter all over the crumbs ; then, 
with a spoon, moisten it with cream. Next, place a layer of 
oysters, alternating with bread crumbs, until the dish is filled, 
finishing with butter and cream ; invert a plate over it to keep 
in the flavor. Bake three-quarters of an hour, or until the 
juice bubbles to the top. Kemove the plate, and brown on the 
upper shelf of the oven for two or three minutes only. — Mrs. H, 

/Scalloped Oysters. 

Those who are fond of oysters prepared in this way will find 
them much more delicate when cooked entirely by reflected 
heat. Have your tinner make you an old-fashioned " tin-kit- 
chen " with sloping sides. Take small oblong dishes, such as 
are in general use at hotels, fill them with alternate layers of 
oysters and rolled crackers, and lay lumps of fresh butter liber- 
ally on top of each dish. Arrange them in the " kitchen," set 
the open dish in front of a bright fire or very warm grate, and 
in fifteen or twenty minutes you will find the oysters delicious. 
^Mrs. B, P.

Put on the oysters with just enough liquor to keep from 

burning, and parboil slightly. Season the rest of the liquor as

to boil one and one-half hour and then be taken out to cool. 
When cold, clean them thoroughly, removing the round liver 
which contains the gall. Cut them into small bits and place 
them in a stewpan, adding pepper, salt, the eggs that are found 
within, one quart water, one-half pound butter, and two table- 
spoonfuls flour mixed with a little cold water. Stir the flour 
and water well into the other ingredients, and stew about 
twenty minutes. As you remove them from the fire, pour in 
one-half pint Madeira wine. — Mrs, A. D. 



FISH. 

In selecting fish, notice if the flesh is firm and hard, the eyes 
full and prominent, the scales bright, the fins stiff", and the gills 
red, as all these indications denote their being fresh. Wash 
the fish, rub it with salt and pepper, and lay it on a dish, or 
hang it up till ready to cook. Never keep it lying in water, 
either in preparing it for cooking, or in trying to keep it till the 
next day. 

In boiling fish, put it in boiling water, and simmer very 
slowly. It will require an hour to boil a large fish, and about 
twenty minutes for a small one. Every housekeeper should 
have a fish-kettle for fish. 

Be careful to have boiling-hot lard in the frying-pan when , 
you go to fry fish. First rub salt and j^epper and flour or meal 
on the fish, then keep it well covered while frying, as you 
should do to every thing that is being fried. Doing this will 
enable you to fry the fish (or other article of food) a pretty 
amber color, while at the same time it will be perfectly done. 

Always have a tin sheet for lifting boiled fish and for turn- 
ing broiled fish. Before broiling, rub with pepper and salt,

well greased with sweet lard and lay the tin sheet over it. 
When yon wish to turn, take the gridiron from the fire, hold- 
ing the tin sheet on top the fish. Hold them together, then lay 
them on a table with the tin sheet down and the gridiron upper- 
most. Carefully raise the gridiron, leaving the fish lying un- 
broken on the tin sheet. The cook may now easily slide the 
fish on the gridiron, put it again on the fire and brown the 
other side, putting the tin sheet back on top of it. Every 
thing should be covered while being broiled. When done, lay 
it on a dish and pour over it melted butter in which has been 
stirred pepper, salt, and minced parsley. If devilled fish is 
desired, add to this dressing, one tablespoonful pepper vinegar, 
one of celery vinegar, one of walnut catsup, one of made mus- 
tard, one wine-glassful of acid fruit jelly. In making sauces 
for fish, never use the water in which the fish has been boiled. 

Full directions for stewing fish are to be found in the subse- 
quent pages.

Barbecued Rabbit. 
Lay the rabbit in salt and water half an hour, scald with 
boiling water, wipe dry, grease with butter, and sprinkle with 
pepper and a little salt. Lay it on the gridiron, turning often 
so that it may cook through and through, without becoming

Wild Turkey. 
If the turkey is old, after it is dressed wash it inside thor- 
oughly with soda and water. Rinse it and plunge it into a pot 
of boiling water for five minutes. Make a stuffing of bits of 
porkj beef, or any other cold meat, plenty of chopped celery, 
stewed giblets, hard-boiled eggs, pounded cracker, pepper, and 
salt, and a heaping spoonful of butter. Work this well and fill 
the turkey. With another large spoonful of butter grease the 
bird, and then sprinkle salt and pepper over it. Lay in a pan, 
with a pint of stock or broth in which any kind of meat has 
been boiled. Place in a hot oven. When it begins to brown, 
dredge with flour and baste, turning often, so that each part 
may be equally browned. Put a buttered sheet of paper over 
the breast, to prevent dryness. When thoroughly done, lay on 
a dish, brown some crackers, pound and sift over it, and serve 
with celery or oyster sauce. — Mrs. T.

They should be carefully cleaned, buttered, sprinkled with 
pepper and salt, and broiled. When they are served, butter 
them again. If you like, serve each bird on a piece of toast, 
and pour over them a sauce of red wine, mushroom catsup, 
salt, cayenne pepper, and celery. 



MEA.TS. 

All meats are better in winter for being kept several weeks, 
and it is well, in summer, to keep them as long as you can with-

out danger of their being tainted. If it is not in your power to 
keep meat in an ice-house, in summer, keep it in a cool dark cellar, 
wrapped around with wet cloths, on top of which lay boughs of 
elderberry. The evaporation from the cloth will keep the meat 
cool and the elderberry will keep olf insects. 

If you should unfortunately be obliged to use stale meat or 
poultry, rub it in and out with soda, before washing it. Tough 
meats and poultry are rendered more tender by putting a little 
vinegar or a few slices of lemon in the water in which they are 
boiled. The use of an acid will save time and fuel in cooking 
them and will render them more tender and digestible. 

If possible, keep the meat so clean that it will not be neces- 
sary to wash it, as water extracts the juices. When it is fro- 
zen, lay it in cold water to thaw, and then cook quickly, to pre- 
vent its losing its moisture and sweetness. 

In roasting or boiling, use but little salt at first, as it hardens 
meat to do otherwise. In roasting, baste frequently, to prevent 
the meat from hardening on the outside, and try to preserve the 
juices. If possible, roast the meat on a spit before a large, open 
fire, after using salt, pepper, butter or lard, and dredging with 
flour. Where an open fire-place cannot be obtained, however, 
the meat may be well roasted in a stove or range. Mutton, 
pork, shote and veal should be well done, bub beef should be 
cooked rare. 

In boiling, put on salt meat in cold water, but fresh meat in 
hot. Remember also that salt meat requires more water and a 
longer time to cook than fresh. Boil slowly, removing the scum 
that rises when it begins to simmer. Keep a tea-kettle of boil- 
ing water at hand to replenish the water in the pot, as it boils 
away. Do not let the meat boil too hard or too long, as this 
will toughen it and extract the juices. Add salt to fresh meat, 
just before it is done. 

Lardering beef, veal, and poultry is a great improvement, 
keeping it moist whilst cooking and adding richness to the fla- 
vor. Lardering consists in introducing slips of clear fat bacoa

or salt pork, into the surface of meat, by means of a pin, sliarp 
at one end and cleft into four divisions at the other. This pin 
may be obtained at any hardware store. 

As the housekeeper is sometimes hurried in preparing a dish, 
it will save time and trouble for her to keep on hand a bottle 
of meat-flavoring compounded of the following ingredients. 

2 chopped onions. 

3 pods of red pepper (chopped). 
2 tablespoonfuls brown sugar. 

1 tablespoonful celery seed. 

1 tablespoonful ground mustard. 

1 teaspoonful turmeric. 

1 teaspoonful black pepper. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 
Put all in a quart bottle and fill it up with cider vinegar. A 
tablespoonful of this mixed in a stew, steak, or gravy, will im- 
part not only a fine flavor, but a rich color. Keeping this mixt- 
ure on hand will obviate the necessity of the housekeeper look- 
ing through various spice boxes and packages to get together 
the requisite ingredients for flavoring, and will thus save her 
time and trouble. 

How TO Select Meats. 

Good and wholesome meat should be neither of a pale rosy or 
pink color, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the diseased 
condition, the last proves the animal has died a natural death. 
Good meat has more of a marble look, in consequence of the 
branching of the veins which surround the adipose cells. The 
fat, especially of the inner organs, is always firm and suety and 
never moist, while in general the fat from diseased cattle is 
flabby and watery and more often resembles jelly or boiled 
parchment. Wholesome meat will always show itself firm and 
elastic to the touch, and exibit no dampness, while bad meat 
will appear soft and moist, in fact, often more wet, so that the 
liquid substance runs out of the blood when pressed hard. 



OBSERVATIONS ON PORK, CURING BACON, ITC. 117 

Good meat has very little smell and diffuses a certain medicinal 
odor. This can be distinctly proved by cutting the meat through 
with a knife and smelling the blade or pouring water over it. 
Lastly, bad meat has the peculiarity that it shrinks considera- 
bly in the boiling, wholesome meat rather swells and does not 
lose an ounoR in weight. 

Observations on Pork, Curing Bacon, etc. 
Hogs weighing from 150 to 200 pounds are the most suitable 
size for family use. They should not exceed twelve months in 
age, as they are much more tender from being young. They 
should be well kept and should be corn-fed several weeks before 
being killed. After being properly dressed, they should hang 
long enough to get rid of the animal heat. When they are 
ready to be cut up, they should be divided into nine principal 
parts, two hams, two shoulders, two middlings, the head or face, 
jowl and chine. The hog is laid on its back to be cut up. The 
head is cut off just below the ears, then it is split down on each 
side of the backbone, which is the chine. This is divided into 
tliree pieces, the upper portion being a choice piece to be eaten 
cold. The fat portion may be cut off to make lard. Each half 
should then first have the leaf fat taken out, which is done by 
cutting the thin skin between it and the ribs, when it is easily 
pulled out. Just under this, the next thing to be removed is 
the mousepiece or tenderloin, lying along the edge, from which 
the backbone was removed, commencing at the point of the 
ham. This is considered the most delicate part and is used to 
make the nicest sausage. Just under this tenderloin are some 
short ribs about three inches long, running up from the point of 
the ham which are known as the griskin. This is removed by a 
sharp knife being run under it, taking care to cut it smooth and 
not too thick. When broiled, it is as nice as a partridge. 

The ribs are next taken out of the shoulder and middling, 
though some persons prefer leaving them in the middling. In 
this case seven should be taken from the shoulder, by a sharp 



118 OBSEEVATIONS ON POKK, CTJEING BACON, ETC. 

knife cutting close to tlie ribs, which make a delicious broil. 
Then cut off the ham, as near the bone as possible, in a half 
circle. The shoulder is then cut square across just behind the 
leg. The feet are then chopped off with a sharp axe or cleaver. 
From the shoulder, they should be cut off leaving a stump of 
about two inches. From the ham, they should be cut off at the 
joint, as smoothly as possible, and then you may proceed to salt 
the meat. 

In order to impart redness to the hams, rub on each a tea- 
spoonful of pulverized saltpetre before salting. If the weather 
is very cold, warm the salt before applying it. First rub the 
skin side well with salt and then the fleshy side, using for the 
purpose a shoe-sole or leather glove. No more salt should be 
used than a sufficiency to preserve the meat, as an excess hard- 
ens the meat. A bushel of salt is sui3S.cient for a thousand 
pounds of meat. For the chine and ribs a very light sprinkling 
of salt will suffice. 

The meat as salted should be packed with the skin side down, 
where it should remain from four to six weeks, according to the 
weather. If the weather is mild, four weeks will answer. 
Should the weather be very cold and the pork in an exposed 
place, it will freeze, and the salt, failing to penetrate the meat, 
will be apt to injure it. 

After it has taken salt sufficiently, the old Virginia mode is 
to break the bulk, shake off the salt, rub the joint pieces (hams 
and shoulders) with good, green- wood ashes (hickory preferred). 
Then rebulk it and let it remain two weeks longer, when it 
should be hung up with the joints down and the other pieces 
may be hung up for smoking at the same time. It is not neces- 
sary that the smoke-house should be very tight, but it is impor- 
tant that the pork should not be very close to the fire. 

A smothered fire made of small billets of wood or chips (hick- 
ory preferred), or of corn cobs, should be made up three times 
a day till the middle of March or first of April, when the joint 
pieces should be taken down and packed in hickory or othei 



PORK STEAK — SPARE-EIBS. 119 

green- wood ashes, as in salt, where they will remain all the sum- 
mer without danger of bugs interfering with them. 

This recipe has been obtained from an old Virginia family, 
famous for their skill in this department of housekeeping. 
This mode of curing makes the best bacon in the world, far 
superior to what are generally called Virginia cured hams. 

Shoat (which I must explain to the uninitiated is a term ap- 
plied in the South to a young pig past the age when it may be 
cooked whole) should be kept up and fattened on buttermilk, 
several weeks before being killed, as this makes the flesh ex- 
tremely delicate. It is best killed when between two and three 
months old. It should then be divided into four quarters. It 
is more delicate and wholesome eaten cold. 

Pork Steak. 

Kemove the skin, beat without breaking into holes ; scald 
with boiling water, wipe dry and broil. When brown lay in a 
hot dish. Sprinkle over pepper, salt, a little sage, chopped 
onion, and parsley ; then butter profusely. 

Grate over all hard biscuit or crackers that have been browned 
and serve. — Mrs. 8. T. 

Spare-ribs. 
Pork chop and pork cutlet may be cooked in the same way, 
omitting the onion if not liked. — Mrs. T.

into a covered stewpan and boil or stew until perfectly done. 
Just before you take them out, add salt, pepper, and minced 
parsley. 

Put on the cover and simmer until well seasoned. 

Take them out of the pan, drain and dry them. For one 
moment let them scorch on a gridiron over a bed of hot coals ; 
lay on a hot dish ; butter each one ; pepper added ; sift over 
browned cracker and serve. — Mrs. /S. T. 

To Cook Spare-ribs and Griskin or Short-ribs. 

Put them on in a small quantity of water and boil for fifteen 
or twenty minutes. Gash them with a knife ; sprinkle with 
pepper and put them on a hot gridiron as near the fire as possi- 
ble ; broil quickly, but not too brown. Have some butter 
melted and pour over the meat and shut it up in the dish. 
These are good for breakfast. — Mrs. P. W. 

To Cook Backbone or Chine. 

Cut the chine in three pieces ; the large end must be about 
a foot long, the remainder cut in half. Put it in a pot of 
water and boil for two hours ; then put it in a pan, baste and 
set it in the stove to brown. Peel some Irish potatoes and put 
them in the pot ; boil till done, mash them up and season with 
pepper, a little salt, and some of the gravy dripping out of the 
chine while baking ; spread them in the dish, then lay the chine 
on top. The largest piece is generally put aside to eat cold, 
and is very nice. Turnips are good, cooked in the same wayoas 
potatoes, with the chine. 

The chine and ham of a hog are nice, corned like beef. — Mrs. 

P. w. 

Backbone Pie. 

Take the smallest end of the backbone, cut in pieces two or 
three inches long ; put in water and boil until done. Make 
nice rich pastry as for chicken pie; line the sides of a baking 
dish with the pastry, put in the bones, adding some water in

with bits of pastry. 

Cover top of baking-dish with pastry ; put in stove and 
brown nicely. — Mrs. G. B. 

To Cook a Ham of Pork. 

Wash off the salt and put it in a pot of water ; boil from 
four to six hours, according to size. Do not take off the skin, 
as it preserves the juice and is much better cold. It is also 
nice to slice and broil with pepper and butter over it. — Mrs. 
^. W. 

Leg of Pork Stuffed. 

Make deep incisions in the meat parallel to the bone, trim it 
so as to leave the skin longer than the flesh ; then boil some pota- 
toes, and when they are done, mash them with a piece of but- 
ter, cayenne pepper and salt, an onion finely chopped, and a 
little rubbed sage. 

With this dressing fill the incisions, draw the skin down and 
skewer it over to keep the dressing from falling out. Season 
the outside of the meat with salt, cayenne pepper and sage. 

Roast it slowly ; when done, pour the gravy in a pan, skim 
off the fat and add some browned flour wet in a little cold 
water, and boil up once. 

Serve with apple or cranberry sauce. — Mrs. A. M. D, 

To Dress Chine. 

Rub the large end with salt and saltpetre, and it will keep 
some time, or you may boil it fresh. Cut the bones of the 
other end apart, sprinkle with flour and a little salt : add one 
teacup of water, and stew. 

It will make two large dishes. — Mrs. W. 

Roast Chine. 
Chine should always be parboiled and stewed before roasting, 
to take away the gross taste which the melted fat frying from

it gives. After this lay in the pan with one pint water in 
which it was boiled, from which all the fat has been skimmed. 
Put in this several whole leaves of sage, to be removed before 
serving — -just to get the flavor ; minced onion, and parsley. 

Baste and brown quickly that it may not dry. 

This is only stewed chine browned. — Mrs. S. T. 

Pork Royal. 
Take a piece of shoulder of fresh pork, fill with grated bread 
and the crust soaked, pepper, salt, onion, sage and thyme : a 
bit of butter and lard. Place in a pan with some water ; when 
about half done, place around it some large apples ; when done, 
place your pork on a dish, with the apples round it ; put flour 
and water on your pan, flour browned, some thyme and sage ; 
boil, strain through a very small colander over your pork and 

apples.

SWEETBREAD OF HOG — SOUSE CHEESE. 123 

15 pounds fat from the back of the chine. 
1 pound salt ; a half pound of black pep'Jjer. 
4 ounces allspice. 
1 ounce sage. 
Cut the fat in small pieces and then chop it ; chop the lean 
very fine : mix all together, kneading in the seasoning. Press 
it down in small pots and pour melted lard over the top —Mrs 
J, D, 

Sweetbread of Hog. 

This nice morsel is between the maw and ruffle piece inside 
of the hog. Put them in soak for a day ; parboil them and 
then gash them and stew them in pepper, butter, one teacup of 
milk and a little vinegar. 

Or they are very nice fried or broiled. — Mrs. P. W. 

Souse Cheese. 

Lay the meat in cold water as cut from the hog. Let it stand 
three or four days, shifting the water each day. Scrape it and 
let it stand a day or two longer,changing the water often, and if 
it should turn warm, pour a little salt in the water. The often- 
er it is scraped, the whiter will be the souse. Boil in plenty 
of water to cover it, replenishing when needed. When tender 
enough, put it in milk-warm water, and when cold in saltwater. 
Boil the head until the bones will almost fVill out. Clean one 
dozen or more ears and boil also ; while hot, chop very fine, and 
season with pepper and salt. 

Put in a mold or bowl with a weight on top. The feet may 
be soused whole, or cut up with the head and ears ; but it is 
not so nice. Clean them by dipping in boiling water and scrap- 
ing ; do not hold them to the fire to singe off the hair. One 

head and one dozen ears will make a good-sized cheese 

Mrs. W, 

To Make Souse from Hog's Feet. 
As soon as the hog is cleaned, cut off the feet and throw tliem 



124 TO CURE LARD — VIRGINIA MODE OF CURmG HAMS. 

in a tub of cold water with a handful of salt ; let them remain 
covered in water until you are ready to clean them, which should 
be done as soon as possible, as they will be much whiter. To 
get the hoof off, put the feet in hot water (not above the hoof) ; 
as soon as they get hot enough, slip a knife between the foot 
and hoof, and slip it off; then scrape the foot nicely, and throw 
into a tub of clear water ; do this for several days. When you 
have scraped and chauged the water for a week, then wash them 
clean and put them on to boil. First put them in a clean pot 
with a thin gruel made of corn meal ; boil until half done. 
"Wash them off, and put on in clear hot water, and boil till done, 
then take them up and throw them into a firkin of clean salt 
and water ; keep closely covered to prevent them from molding. 
They are now ready to fry, which should be done by splitting 
the foot in half and fried in egg batter. — Mrs. P. TT. 

To Cuke Lard. 

As soon as it is taken from the hog, cut in small pieces, wash 
clean, press out the water, and put in the pot to boil, with one 
gallon of water to a vessel holding four gallons. Boil briskly 
until nearly done, or until the cracklins begin to brown, then 
cook slowly to prevent burning. The cracklins should be of a 
light brown and crisp, and will sink to the bottom when done. 
This is Leaf Lard. 

The fat off of the backbone is also very nice, done in the same 
way, and does not require soaking, unless bloody. The fat from 
the entrails can also be made into nice lard by soaking for a day 
or two in fresh water, changing it frequently, and throwing a 
handful of salt in the tub of water to draw out the blood and 
impurities. When ready to render, wash in warm water twice 
and boil in more water than you do for leaf lard. The crack- 
lins will not become crisp, but remain soft, and will sink to 
the bottom ; they are used for making soap. 

YiRGiNiA Mode of Curing Hams. 
Put one teaspoonful saltpetre on the fleshy side of each ham. 



TO CUKE BACON — FOR CURING HAMS. 125 

Salt not too heavily for five weeks ; if the weather is freezing 
cold, six weeks ; then brush the hams well, and rub them with 
hickory ashes ; let them lie for one week, then hang and smoke 
them for six weeks with green hickory chips. After brushing, 
pack them in hickory ashes in a bulk. — 3Irs. P. C. M. 

To Cure Bacon. 
Pack the meat in salt and allow it to remain five weeks. 
Then take the hams up, wash oiF, and wipe dry. Have some 
sacks made of about seven-eighths shirting, large enough to hold 
the hams and tie above the hock. Make a pot of sizing of 
equal portions of flour and corn meal, boil until thick, and dip 
each sack until the outside is well coated with sizing. Put 
the hams in bags, and tie tight with a strong twine and hang by 
the same in the smoke-house.

126 AN IMPROVEMENT TO HAMS TO BOIL HAM. 

2 teacups cayenne pepper. 
1 teacup black pepper. 
Mix these ingredients well together in a large tub, rub it 
into each ham with a brick, or something rough to get it in 
well. Pack in a tight, clean tub and weigh down. Let the 
hams remain six weeks ; then take them out and rub each one 
on the fleshy side with one tablespoonful black pepper to avoid 
skippers. Hang in the meat house, and smoke with green 
hickory for from ten to twelve hours a day for six weeks, not 
suffering the wood to blaze. On the 1st of April, take them 
down and pack in any coal ashes or pine ashes well slaked. 
Strong ashes will rot into the meat. — il/rs. R. M. 

An Improvement to Hams. 
Sometimes very good bacon is found to be of a bad color 
when cooked. This may be remedied by keeping it in ashes 
(hickory is best) for a few weeks before using. Must then be 
hung up, with ashes adhering, until needed. This also prevents 
skippers. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Boil a Ham Weighing Ten Pounds. 
Let it soak for twenty-four hours, changing the water two or 
three times. Boil it slowly eight or ten hours : when done, put 
it into a dish, as nearly as possible the shape of a ham, taking 
care first to take out the bone — turn the rind down. When 
cold, turn it out into a large dish, garnish with jelly and orna- 
mental paper. Serve with the rind on. To be eaten cold. —

TO BOIL HAM — BAKED HAM OR TONGUE. 127 

To Boil JSaTfh. 

The day before you wish to boil a ham, scrape, wash and 
wipe it dry, and put it in the sun. At night put it into water 
and soak till next morning. Then lay it with the skin down 
in a boiler of cold water, and boil slowly for five hours. If the 
ham is large, boil six hours. When perfectly done and tender, 
set the boiler aside, with the ham and liquor undisturbed, until 
cold. Then take ofi" the skin, sprinkle black pepper over 
thickly, and sift over crackers first browned and pounded ; for 
special occasions, place at equal distances over the ham, scraped 
horseradish in Jozenge shape, and edged with curled parsley. 
This mode keeps the ham juicy. — Mrs. S. T. 

Baked Ham. 

First of all, soak an old ham overnight, having first washed 
and scraped it. Next moruing put in a boiler of milk-warm 
water with the skin side down. Boil slowly for four or five 
hours, according to size, and if a very large ham, six hours. 
When done, set aside, the boiler with the ham and liquor in it, 
to remain until cold ; when the skin must be taken ofi*, and it 
must be trimmed of a nice shape. Sprinkle over two tablespoon- 
fuls black pepper. Lay the ham on a grating or twist in the 
baking-pan, in which pour a pint of water, and set it in a hot 
oven. This mode prevents the frying so disagreeable to the 
taste. After the ham is heated through, and the pepper strikes 
in, sift over cracker ; return to the oven and brown, then dec- 
orate with scraped horseradish and parsley, and serve. —Mrs. 
S. T. 

Baked Ham or Tongues.

JBaked Sam. 

Most persons boil ham, but it is mucli better if baked prop- 
erly. Soak it for an hour in clean water and wipe dry ; next 
spread it all over with a thin batter, put it into a deep dish 
with sticks under it to keep it out of the gravy. When it is 
fully done, take off the skin and batter crusted upon the flesh 
side and set it away to cool. — Mrs. JB. tT. JB, 

Stuffed and Baked Ham. 

After your ham is boiled, take the skin off. Take pepper, all- 
spice, cloves and mace, well pounded; add a little bread 
crumbs, and a little brown sugar ; mix with a little butter and 
water. 

Gash your ham and take out plugs ; fill in with the mixture.

Broiled Ham. 

To have this dish in a perfection, ham must first be soaked, 
then boiled nearly done, and set aside to take slices from, as 
wanted. Cut rather thin, lay on a gridiron over hot coals ; 
when hot through, lay on a dish, and pepper well. Pour over 
fresh butter melted, and serve. If a raw ham is used, the 
slices must be cut thicker, dropped in a pan of boiling water for 
a few minutes, then broiled as above, — Mrs. S. T. 

Fried Ham. 
The slices are always taken from a raw ham, but are most 
delicate when first simmered a short time : five minutes in a 
stewpan, dried with a clean cloth and put in a hot frying-pan, 
first removing the skin. The pan must be hot enough to 
scorch and brown both ham and gravy quickly. Lay the 
slices on a hot dish, pour into the gravy half a teacup new 
milk, pepper, and minced parsley ; boil up and serve. — Mrs.

Take a good head of cabbage, cut, quarter, and wash clean ; 
press the water out as dry as you can. Boil them one or two 
hours with half a pod of red pepper ; put them on a dish and 
the middling on top. You can fry the cabbage next day, and 
make a savory dish, but it does not suit dyspeptics. The thin 
part of the middling is used for frying, and is called " breakfast 
bacon."— Jlfrs. P. W.

Dip the ham or slices of middling in bread crumbs. Put in 
a frying-pan with chopped parsley and pepper. Just before 
taking off the fire, pour to the gravy a cup of cream. — 
Mrs. W. 

Jowl and Turnip Salad. 

This is an old Virginia dish, and much used in the spring of 
the year. 

The jowl, which must have been well smoked, must be washed 
clean, and boiled for three hours. Put in the salad, and boil 
half an hour ; if you boil too long, it will turn yellow. It is 
also good broiled for breakfast with pepper and butter over it. 

The jaw-bone should be removed before sending to the table ; 
this is easily done by running a knife around the lip and under 
the tongue. The jowl and salad should always be served with 
fresh poached eggs, — Mrs. P. W. 

Pickled Pork Equal to Fresh. 
Let the meat cool thoroughly ; cut into pieces four to six 
inches wide, weigh them and pack them as tight as possible in 
a barrel, salting very slightly. Cover the meat with brine made 
as strong as possible. Pour off a gallon of brine and mix with 
it one tablespoonful saltpetre for every 100 pounds meat and 
return it to the barrel. Let it stand one month, then take out 
the meat, let it drain twelve hours. Put the brine in an iron 
kettle, and one quart treacle or two pounds sugar, and boil

until perfectly clear. When it is cold, return the meat to the 
barrel and pour on the brine. Weight it down and keep it 
covered close, and you will have the sweetest meat you ever 
tasted. 

How TO Cook Salt Pork. 
Many people do not relish salt pork fried, but it is quite 
good to soak it in milk two or three hours, then roll in Indian 
meal and fry to a light brown. This makes a good dish with 
mashed turnips, or raw onions cut in vinegar ; another way is 
to soak it over night in skimmed milk and bake like fresh 
pork ; it is almost as good as fresh roast pork. 

Ham Toast. 

Mince about one pint boiled lean ham. 

Add the yolks of three eggs well beaten, two tablespoonfuls 
cream, and a little cayenne pepper. 

Stir all on the fire until it thickens, and spread on hot toast 
with the crust cut off. — Mrs. J. T. B. 

Ham Toast. 

Chop very fine two spoonfuls of lean ham that has been 
cooked ; take two spoonfuls veal gravy ; a few bread crumbs. 

Put all together in a stewpan and heat it. Have ready a 
toast buttered, spread the above upon it, strew a few bread 
crumbs over it and brown it before the fire. — Mrs. S. 

Ham Kelish. 
Cut a slice of dressed ham, season it highly with cayenne 
pepper and broil it brown ; then spread mustard over it, squeeze 
Oil it a little lemon juice, and serve quickly. 

Potted Tongue or Ham. 
Remove all skin, gristle, and outside parts from one pound 
of the lean of cold boiled tongue or ham. 

Pound it in a mortar to a smooth paste with either one-

quarter pound of the fat, or with two ounces fresh butter , 
Season with cayenne, pounded mace and allspice. 

Press ifc well into pots and cover with clarified butter or fat. 

To EoAST Shoat. 
The hind-quarter is considered best. Cut off the foot, leav- 
ing the hock quite short. Wash well and put into boiling 
water ; simmer until done, adding salt and pepper just before 
lifting from the kettle ; salt put in sooner hardens and toughens. 
Place the meat in a baking-pan and score across, in the direction 
in which it is to be carved. Skim several ladlefuls from the 
top of the kettle and pour over ; after this has dried off, 
sprinkle over a little salt and pepper, cover with an egg beaten 
stifF, sift over powdered cracker, and set to brown. Lay around 
sweet potatoes first parboiled, then cut in thick slices. Serve 
with minced parsley and thyme, both on the meat and in the 
gr&Yj.—Mrs. /S. T. 

To PoAST A Fore Quarter of Shoat. 

Put it on in hot water, boil for half an hour ; take it out, 
put in a pan, gash it across with a sharp knife, in diamond 
shapes, grease it with lard and dredge with flour, pepper and a 
little salt. Peel some good Irish potatoes, lay them around the 
pan and set in the stove to brown, basting frequently. This 
meat should be cooked done, as it is not good the least 
rare. Grate some bread crumbs over it and serve. — Mrs. 

P. w. 

To Barbecue Shoat. 

Lay the shoat in water till ready for use ; if small, it will 
cook in an hour. Put in the oven with two spoonfuls of water, 
a piece of lard, and dredge with flour. When ready for use, 
pour in half a teacup of walnut catsup, and, if not fat, a piece 
of butter. 



SHOAT JOWL — ROAST PIG. 133 

Shoat Jowl. 
The upper half of the head is what is generally used for 
what is called " The Pig's-head Stew." Another nice dish may- 
be made of the under jaw or jowl by parboiling until the jaw- 
bone can be taken out; always adding pepper and salt just 
before it is done. When perfectly bender, score across ; pepper 
and salt again, cover with beaten egg, then with cracker. Set 
in a pan with some of the water in which it was boiled. Put 
In a hot oven and brown. — Mrs. S. T. 

PoAST Pig. 

When roasted whole, a pig should not be under four nor over 
six weeks old. In town, the butcher prepares for roasting, 
but it is well to know, in the country, how this may be done. 
As soon as the pig is killed, throw it into a tub of cold water, 
to make it tender ; as soon as cold, take it by the hind leg, and 
plunge into scalding, not boiling water (as the last cooks the 
skin so that the hair can with difficulty be removed), shake it 
about until the hair can be removed by the handful. When all 
that is possible has been taken off in this way, rub from the 
tail up to the end of the nose with a coarse cloth. Take off 
the hoofs, scrape and wash the ears and nose until perfectly 
clean. The nicest way to dress it is to hang it by the hind 
legs, open and take out the entrails ; wash well wdth water, 
with a little soda dissolved in it; rinse again and again, and 
leave hanging an hour. Wrap in a coarse cloth wrung out Ox 
cold water and lay on ice or in a cool cellar until next morning, 
when, if the weather is warm, it must be cooked. It should 
never be used the same day that it is killed. 

First prepare the stuffing of the liver, heart and haslets of 
the pig, stewed, seasoned, and chopped. Mix with these an 
equal quantity of boiled potatoes mashed ; add a large spoonful 
of butter, with some hard-boiled eggs, parsley and thyme, 
chopped fine, pepper and salt. 

Scald the pig on the inside, dry it and rub with pepper and

salt, fill and sew up. Bend the fore legs under the body, the 
hind legs forward, under the pig, and skewer to keep in position. 
Place in a large baking-pan, pour over one quart of boiling 
water. Have a lump of fresh butter tied up in a clean rag ; 
rub it all over the pig, then sprinkle over pepper and salt, put- 
ting some in the pan with a bunch of herbs ; invert over it a 
baking-pan while it simmers, and steam until entirely done. Un- 
derdone pork, shoat, or pig, is both unpalatable and unwhole- 
some. Remove the pan, rub over with the butter and baste 
often. When of a fine brown, cover the edges of a large dish 
with a deep fringe of curled parsley ; first sift over the pig pow- 
dered cracker, then place it, kneeling, in the green bed. Place 
in its mouth an orange or a red apple ; and, if eaten hot, serve 
with the gravy in a tureen or sauce-boat. It is much nicer 
cold ; served with little mounds of grated horseradish amongst 
the parsley. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Stew Pig's Head and Jowl. 

Clean the head and feet ; take out the bone above the nose ; 
cut off the ears, clean them nicely. Separate the jowl from the 
head ; take care of the brains to add to the stew. Put the head, 
jowl, feet and part of the liver in water sufficient to keep 
well covered ; boil until quite done. Split the feet to put on 
the dish; hash the head and liver ; but do not spoil the jowl, 
which must be put in the middle of the dish and surrounded 
with the feet and hash. Put all of the hash, jowl and feet in. 
the pot and season with a cup of cream, a lump of butter, pep- 
per and salt, a tablespoonful walnut catsup, an onion chopped 
fine, a stalk of celery. 

A teaspoonful mustard improves it. 

Stew half an hour ; thicken the gravy with grated bread. — 
Mrs, P. W. 

Shoat's Head. 

Get a shoat's head and clean it nicely. Boil and chop in 
pieces. Season with:

2 tablespoonfuls tomato catsup. 

2 tablespoonfuls walnut catsup. 

2 cups water. 

A little flour. 

1 large spoonful butter. 

Pepper and salt. 
Have two or three hard-boiled eggs, cut them in half and lay 
on the top of the head ; set it in the oven to bake. 

Veal or mutton head, can be cooked in the same way, but 
are not so nice. — Mrs. R. 

Shoat's Head, to Stew. 

Clean the head and feet ; and put them on to parboil with 
the liver. Then split up the head, through the nose, taking 
out the bones. Cut the meat from the feet and chop up with 
the liver, season this with pepper and salt. 

Lay the head open and fill it with this mince and the yolks 
of some hard-boiled eggs : if this does not fill the head, add 
some grated bread crumbs or crackers and butter. 

Sew up the head and bind it with thread ; put it in the pot 
with the water it has been parboiled in and let it stew slowly. 
Take up the head, and add to the gravy a lump of butter, rolled 
in flour, some browning and some walnut catsup. Pour this 
over the head, which should be brown. If the shoat is not 
very small, use bread and butter instead of the liver. — Mrs. H. 

To Hash Pig's Head. 
Take head, feet, and haslet of pig ; boil them until done, then 
cut them up fine, taking out the bones.

eggs and one cup walnut catsup. — Mrs, Dr. tT.

BEEF AND VEAL. 

In selecting beef, see that the flesh is firm and of a clear red, 
and the fat of a yellowish white. In buying a quarter of beef, 
it is better to have it cut up by the butcher, if you are living 
in town. The hind quarter is considered better, and sells higher 
than the fore quarter. If a roasting piece is desired, the sirloin 
from the hind quarter is usually preferred. It is not generally 
known, however, that the second cut of the rib-roast from the 
fore quarter is the finest roast from the beef. 

When the bone has been removed, and the meat skewered in 
the shape of a round, by the butcher, it is well to roast it on a 
spit before an open fire. If the latter cannot be obtained, how- 
ever, plunge the beef for a moment in boiling water, then rub 
well with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and place on a 
little grate or trivet which will readily go in a baking-pan. In 
this pour about a pint of the water in which the beef was 
scalded. Place it in a very hot oven, with an inverted tin 
plate on top of the roast. E-emove this plate often to baste 
the meat. When nearly done, which will be in about two 
hours for a roast of six pounds, baste several times and bake a 
nice brown. Season the gravy with minced onion, parsley and 
thyme, add a little salt and pepper and a tablespoonful of the 
meat flavoring of which a receipt was given in the general direc- 
tions about meat. Serve the gravy in a sauce-tureen, so that 
each person may choose whether to eat the beef with gravy or 
with the juice that escapes from the meat while it is being 
carved. The latter mixed with grated horseradish is preferred 
to gravy by some persons. 



BEEF AND VEAL. 137 

Every portion of the beef, from head to feet^ is useful and 
delicious when properly prepared. 

The rounds and rump pieces are generally used for beef d la- 
mode. 

Fresh beef from the ribs, boiled with turnips, is considered 
a nice dish by some persons. 

For steak, nothing is so nice as tenderloin or porter-house 
steak. I take this occasion to protest against the unwholesome 
custom of frying steak in lard. When inconvenient to broil, it 
may be deliciously cooked by being first beaten till tender, then 
laid in a hot frying-pan, closely covered, and cooked without 
lard or butter, in its own juices. When scorched brown on 
both sides, but not hard, remove the pan from the fire, pepper 
and salt the steak, and put a large tablespoonful of fresh butter 
on it. Press this in with a knife and fork, turning the steak, 
so that each side may absorb the butter. Serve on a hot dish. 
The whole process will not consume five minutes. Some per- 
sons think it best to add the salt after the steak is done, though 
many good housekeepers salt and pepper the steak before 
before broiling it. Beefsteak should be cooked rare ; it is a 
great mistake to cook it till hai'd and indigestible. 

The parts most suitable for soup are the head, neck, shank, 
and all the unsightly parts. After the bones are broken and 
the meat boiled from them, the liquor is used for soup, while 
the meat, picked or cut to pieces, will make an excellent stew 
seasoned with potatoes, turnips, sweet herbs, one tablespoonful 
of butter and th« same of meat flavoring. 

It is well always to keep brine on hand for corning beef. 
All the parts not desirable for roast or steak had better be 
corned. 

The beef, after being dressed, should be hung up by the hind 
legs, with a smooth, round piece of timber sufiiciently strong 
to hold the weight, passed through the legs at the hook, or run 
between the tendon and bone, with short pegs to keep the legs 
stretched apart. Then with a sharp axe, standing behind the 



138 BEEF — TO ROAST BEEF. 

suspended beef, split it down the backbone, severing it in half. 
Then pass a knife through the ribs, leaving two or three short 
ribs on the hind-quarter. Sever the backbone with an axe. 
Then cut with a sharp knife straight across the parallel line 
with the spinal bone, which piece must be divided into two 
pieces, the sirloin and steak. Then take oS two rounds, or 
three, according to the size of the animal, cutting with a sharp 
knife, and cutting the bone with a meat saw or axe, as near the 
joints as possible, which leaves the shin-bone. 

The fore quarter then is divided into four pieces, after taking 
olF the shoulder, which may be divided into three or more 
pieces. 

The loin of veal is the nicest part, and is always roasted. 

The fillets and knuckles may be stewed and roasted. 

The latter is nicest for soup. 

The breast may be stewed or roasted. 

The cutlets are nicest from the legs or fillet. 

The head is a dish for soup, stew or pie. 

Sweetbreads from the throat make a delicious dish, much 
prized by epicureans. 

The feet, boiled till the bones drop out, make a delightful 
dish, fried in batter, while the water in which they are boiled 
makes excellent jelly. 

Yeal, to be eaten in its perfection, should be killed when from 
four to six weeks old. 

Beep. 

The sirloin, or fore and middle ribs, are best for roasting. 

The steaks are best cut from the ribs, or the inner part of 
the sirloin ; shank, tail and head make nice soup. — Mrs. W. 

To Roast Beef. 
Lay the meat on some sticks in a dripping-pan or other ves- 
sel, so that it will not touch the water which it is necessary to 
have in the bottom. Season with salt and pepper, and put in 



RIB ROAST OF BEEF TO BOAST BEEF. 139 

the oven tliree or four hours before it is wanted for the table. 
Baste it often with the water in the bottom of the pan, renew- 
ing it as often as it gets low. This makes sweet, juicy roast 
beef. The great secret of it is, not to have the meat touch tlie 
water in the bottom of the pan, and to baste it often. Tough, 
unpromising pieces of beef are best cooked by steaming tlioih 
an hour and a half or so and then putting them in the oven 
aud roasting as much longer. 

Crackers, first browned and then pounded, should always be 
kept to sift over roast meats : and curled parsley to garnish 
with. Grated horseradish is also excellent with the roast. 
—Mrs. S. T, 

Rib Roast of Beef. 
Get, from the butcher, a rib-roast — the second cut is best — 
and get him to take out the bones, and roll and skewer it : if 
this is not convenient, it can be done at home with a sharp 
knife. Before roasting, take out the wooden skewers put in at 
market, unroll, season well with salt and pepper and anything 
else liked, and roll again tightly, fastening securely with the 
iron skewer pins. Put it in a pan on a little iron griddle or 
trivet, made for the purpose to keep it just over the pint of 
water in the pan. Pepper and salt freely, dredge with flour 
.. and baste. Some persons like half a teacup of pepper vinegar, 
poured over just before it is done; and minced onion, thyme 
and parsley added to the gravy, which should be brown. — 
Mrs. B. 

To Roast Beef. 

The sirloin is the nicest for the purpose. 

Plunge the beef in boilinor water and boil for thirty minutes : 
then put it in the stove-pan; skim the top of the water in 
which it has been boiled, and baste the roast, after dredging it 
with flour ; pepper and salt to taste. Baste frequently, and 
roast till done.— ilfr^. P. W.

JBeef d la Mode. 
Take a round or a rump piece of beef, take out the bone, the 
gristle and all the tough pieces about the edges. Fill the cavi- 
ties from which the bone was taken, with suet, and fat salt 
pork. 

Press this so as to make it perfectly round, pass around a 
coarse, strong piece of cloth, so as to hold it firmly in shape. 
If .the round is six inches thick, the cloth must be six inches 
wide, leaving the top and bottom open. With a larding needle, 
fill this thickly with strips of fat pork, running throTigh from 
top to bottom and about one inch apart each way. Set this in 
a baking-pan, pour over : 

1 teacup boiling water, 

1 teacup boiling vinegar ; mixed.

Sprinkle over the beef liberally with salt and black pepper ; 
chop one small onion fine, and lay over top of the beef. Sim- 
mer this for two or three hours, basting frequently and keeping 
an inverted tin plate over the beef except when basting. If the 
gravy stews down too much, add stock or broth of any kind. 
Turn it over, and let the top be at the bottom. When it is 
done and tender, skim the fat from the gravy. Pour over : 
2 tablespoonfuls celery vinegar. 
2 tablespoonfuls pepper. 
2 tablespoonfuls made mustard. 
1 wineglassful acid fruit jelly. 
Simmer and bake for two hours longer, frequently basting, 
that it may be soft and seasoned through and through. Take the 
beef from the pan and remove the cloth ; place in a large flat dish, 
pour over the gravy, and over this one teacup of mushroom sauce. 
Sift finely powdered cracker over the top and garnish with 
grated or scraped horseradish and parsley. — Mrs. S. T.

Simmer and baste as you would a roast duck. Sift over it 
browned cracker, pounded fine. Very nice. — Jjfrs, /S. T. 

Beefsteak Broiled. 
Cut the steak one-half inch thick ; it should then be beaten 
with a steak beater or pestle. The griddle should be hot and on 
the coals : place the steak on the griddle, and as soon as seared, 
turn it ; when both sides are seared, j)lace it in a pan, season 
it with pepper, salt, and butter : repeat this for every piece of 
steak, and place in the pan, which should be kept closely cov- 
ered without being on the fire. If your heat is sufiicient, from 
three to five minutes is sufficient to cook. — Mrs. P. W. 



BROILED STEAK — BEEFSTEAK FEIED WITH ONIONS. 143 

Broiled Steak. 
A porter-liouse steak is considered, by some persons, best, 
others prefer the tenderloin. Beat either tender, and place on 
a gridiron over coals, frequently turning. Have ready a hot 
dish, place the steak on it, pepper and salt well, then with a 
knife and fork profusely butter, with one large tablespoonful 
fresh butter, turning and pressing it so as to absorb the butter ; 
pepper again and set the dish over boiling water until wanted, 
when it will be found tender and juicy, if not cooked too long 
on a gridiron. One tablespoonful pepper vinegar gives this the 
taste of venison, and to this may be added one tablesj)oonful 
made mustard, for those who like highly seasoned food. — M7's. 
S. T. 

How TO Cook Beefsteak. 
Take a thin, long-handled frying-pan, put it on the stove and 
heat it quite hot. In this put the pieces of steak previously 
pounded, but do not put a particle of butter in the frying-pan 
and do not salt the steak. Allow the steak to merely glaze over 
and then turn it quickly to the other side, turning it several 
times in this manner, until it is done. Four minutes is sufficient 
for cooking. When done, lay it on the platter, previously 
warmed ; butter {Jnd salt, and set a moment in the hot oven. 
Allow the steak to heat but a moment on each side ; this helps 
it to retain all its sweet juices, and putting on the salt at the 
last monent, after it is on the platter, draws out its juices. — 
Mrs, S. T. 

Beefsteak Fried with Onions. 

Prepare the steak as for broiling, pepper and roll in flour and 
fry in lard ; remove the steak from the pan when done ; add to 
the gravy one chopped onion, pepper, salt, one-half teacup water, 
and a little mustard. 

Cook a few minutes, put the steak in the gravy — let it remain 
a short time ; send to the table hot. — 3frs. P. W.

To Fby Steak. 

Hunt up all the pickle and take from eacb one teacup vinegar, 
lay the steak in a deep dish, pour over the vinegar and let it 
stand one hour. Take a clean frying-pan, throw in one ounce 
butter, and some of the vinegar from the dish, sufficient to stew 
the steak. If managed properly, when done it will be imbedded 
in a thick gravy. Put the steak in a hot dish, before the fire ; 
into the pan, put one spoonful black pepper, one or two of cat- 
sup, and one of raw mustard. — Jfrs. aS. 

Juried /Steak. 

Get from the butcher a tenderloin or porter-house steak. Do 
not wash it, but be careful to lay it on a clean block and beat it 
well, but not into holes, nor so as to look ragged. Sprinkle 
over pepper and salt, then dredge with flour on both sides. 

Have ready a hot frying-pan, lay in the steak and cover 
closely. The juice of the meat will be sufficient to cook it. 
Turn often, as the pan must be hot enough to scorch and make 
the steak and gravy brown. 

Before it gets hard or overdone, butter liberally ; place in a 
hot dish. Pepper again, and, if preferred, pour over first one 
tablespoonful pepper vinegar, then one tablespoonful made mus- 
tard, and turn in over all the hot gravy. Sift powered cracker 
over and serve. — Jlrs. S. T. 

Frizzled Beef. 

Shred some dried beef, parboil it until it is sufficiently freshen- 
ed, drain off the water and add enough boiling water to cover 
it. Bub equal quantities of butter and flour together until 
smooth, then add to the beef. Beat up three eggs, yolks and 
whites together, stir these in with a little pepper, a couple of 
minutes before taking from the fire. This is to be served hot on 
toast.— Jfrs. F.

Fricassi^ed Beef. 
Take any piece of beef from tlie fore quarter, such as is gen- 
erally used for corning, and cook it tender in just water enough 
to have it all evaporate in cooking. When about half done, put 
in salt enough to season well, and half teaspoonful pepper. If 
the water should not boil away soon enough, turn it ofl*, and let 
the beef fry fifteen minutes — it is better than the best roast 
beef. Take two tablesj)oonfuls flour, adding the fat — when 
mixed, pour on the hot juice of the meat. Serve with apple 
sauce. — Mrs. D.

minutes in rich brown gravy. — Mrs. M, 

Beef Kidney, to Fry. 
Trim and cut the kidney in slices ; season them with salt and 
pepper, and dredge well with flour; fry on both sides, and 
when done, lift them out, empty the pan and make a gravy for 
them with a small piece of butter, one dessertspoonful flour, 
pepper, salt, and a cup of boiling water. Shake these around 
and give them a minute's simmering ; add a little tomato or 
mushroom catsup, lemon juice, vinegar, or any good sauce 
to give it a flavor. Minced herbs are to many tastes an 
improvement to this dish, to which a small quantity of onion 
may be added when it is liked. — Mrs. A. M. D. 

Kidneys Grilled. 
Prepare them as for stewing, cut each kidney in half and dip 
them in egg beaten up with salt and pepper ; bread-crumb

Skin the liver, cut in slices and lay in salt water, as soon as 
it comes from market. Fry in lard with pepper, very brown. 
Season to taste. — Mrs. C. 

To Fry Liver. 
The slices must be cut thin, as they require some time to fry ; 
brown both sides ; when taken up, add butter and salt to taste. 
Fry in hot lard. — Mrs. P. W. 

Beef Liver with Onions. 
Slice the liver rather thin, and throw into salt and water. 
Meantime slice the onions and put into a deep frying-pan, just 
covered with water, and boil until done, keeping it closely cov- 
ered. When the water has all boiled away, put in a heaping 
spoonful of sweet lard, and fry until the onions are a light 
brown. Take them up in a deep plate ; set them on the back 
of the stove or range to keep hot, and fry the liver in the same 
pan, adding more lard if there is not enough. Season all with 
salt and pepper, cutting the liver in slices suitable to help one 
person. Make a little mound of fried onions on each piece, 
grate pounded cracker on the top, and serve. — 3frs. S. T.

the li^ er back, stir it up, and cover it up for a short time to 
keep it from being hard. 

Kidneys can be cooked the same way, excepting you must 
add some butter, as they are very dry. — Mrs. P. W. 

To Stew Brains. 
Have them thoroughly soaked in salt water to get the blood 
out. Put them in a stewpan with water enough to cover them ; 
boil half an hour, pour off the water, and add one teacup of 
cream or milk, salt, pepper, and butter the size of an egg. 
Boil well together for ten minutes, when put into the dish. 
Add one tablespoonful vinegar. — JUrs. P. W. 

To Dress Brains. 

Lay in salt and water, then either scramble like eggs, or beat 
the yolks of eggs with a little flour ; dip the brains in and fry 
them.— Mrs. W, 

To Fry Beef Brains. 
Pour over the brains salt water, let them remain for an hour, 
changing the water to draw the blood out, then pour over them 
some boiling water and remove the skin. Beat up two eggs, 
and make a batter with a little flour, bread crumbs and crackers. 
Season with pepper and salt. Fry in hot lard, — Mrs. P. W. 

To Fry Brains. 
Soak the brains for several hours in weak salt water to get 
out the blood ; drain and put them in a saucepan and pour very 
little boiling water on ; simmer a few minutes. Handle them 
lightly, and arrange so as to form round cakes, without break- 
ing. Pepper them and use very little salt; brains require very 
little salt. Have ready a beaten egg^ and cover the top of the 
cakes with it, using a spoon to put it on. Sift over grated 
cracker and fry in hot lard ; serve the other side the same way. 
Keep closely covered while frying. — Mrs, jS. T, 



BRAIN CROQUETTES ^BEEF TRIPE. 



151 



Brain Croquettes. 
Wash the brains of three heads very thoroughly, until they 
are free from membraneous matter and perfectly white. Then 
scramble with three eggs. When cold, roll into egg-shaped 
balls, with floured hands; dip in beaten egg, then in cracker or 
stale bread crumbs, and fry in lard. — Mrs. B. L. 

To Prepare Tripe. 
Empty the contents of the stomach of a fat beef; put it in 
boiling water, one piece at a time, to prevent getting too hot. 
Scrape with a sharp knife, then put it in a vessel of cold water 
with salt ; wash thoroughly, and change the salt water every day 
for four or five consecutive days ; when perfectly white, boil in 
a very clean vessel of salt water. Then put it in vinegar until 
you wish to use it. Cut it in pieces of three or four inches 
square, and fry in egg batter. — Mrs. J, H. 

Tripe. 
The moment the tripe is taken out, wash it thoroughly in 
many cold waters. (If you have quick-lime, sift it over the 
dark inner coat, and instantly scrape off the coat.) Cut it in 
four parts. Have ready boiling water, dip and scrape until it 
becomes quite white. Prepare weak brine with a considerable 
mixture of meal ; let it soak a day. Continue to shift it every 
day, and every other day scrape it ; this must be done for a 
week, and then make nice gruel, in which it must be well 
boiled, first tying it up in a cloth. When boiled, take it out 
of the cloth, and lay it in a weak brine for a night, after which 
it may be put with the feet. — Mrs. B. 

Beef Tripe. 
Clean the tripe carefully. Soak several days in salt water, 
then in clear water, changing several times. Cut in slices, boil 
perfectly done, dip in a batter of egg (beaten light), milk and 



162 TO FKY TKIPE ^BEEF SAUSAGE. 

flour, or sift meal over it. Fry or broil. Season with pepper 
and salt. 

To Fry Tripe. 

Cut the tripe after it has been boiled, into strips about four 
inches wide and six long. Make a batter with two eggs, one 
teacup of flour and a little milk. Pepper the tripe and roll it 
in the batter. Fry in a pan of hot lard ; as soon as one side 
is done, turn it over on the other side. — Mrs. P. TFi 

Gravy for Koast Beep. 

When the joint is done to a turn, dish it and place before 
the fire ; then carefully remove the fat from the dripping-pan, 
and pour the gravy into the dish, not over the meat, as is the 
custom of inexperienced cooks, who, moreover, ruthlessly drown 
it with a cupful of boiling water or highly flavored made-gravy. 
This is an error, for there is always a sufficient quantity of 
natural gravy in good meat to render the use of foreign sauces 
superfluous. — Mrs. P. 

Brown Gravy. 
Take the gravy that drips from the meat ; add a little water, 
one spoonful butter, a little flour, a little pepper and a little 
salt. Stew all together. — Miss E. P. 

Bologna Sausage. 
Take ten pounds of beef, and four pounds pork, two-thirds 
le<an and one-third fat ; chop very fine and mix well together. 
Season with six ounces fine salt, one ounce black pepper, one- 
half ounce cayenne pepper, and sage to the taste. — Mrs, 
Dr. 8. 

Beep Sausage. 

Take tough beef and run it through a sausage machine. Form 
the pulp into shapes an inch thick, and the size of a common 
beefsteak. Season to the taste. — Mrs. G. 



cow HEEL — A FKENCH DISH. 153 

Cow Heel. 

As soon as the beef is killed, throw the feet in cold water, 
and let them remain during the night. In the morning, put 
them into a pot of cold water and let them boil until you find 
you can easily take off the hair and the hoof with a knife ; take 
care as the water boils away to replenish with boiling water. 
Have ready strong brine, not boiled nor strong enough to bear 
an egg, and the moment the feet are stripped, throw them in. 
Let them stand one night and in the morning pour the brine 
from them and put to them a fresh brine, with a small quantity 
of vinegar. In a day or two, they are fit for use. — Mrs. H. 

Cow Heel Fried. 

Buy the feet prepared at the butchers ; boil well done. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper. 

Have ready an egg batter ; fry brown, and serve hot. A nice 
breakfast dish. — Mrs. H. L. O. 

To Fry Beef Heel. 

Have a batter made of eggs, flour, etc., as for tripe. Split the 
feet into convenient shapes and fry in hot lard. Pour some 
vinegar over them while frying. — Mrs. P. W, 

Daube Froide. 

Take a beef shin, chop in several places to break the bone, 
keep it cooking in just water enough to prevent burning, till 
it falls to pieces. 

Then after taking out the bones, season with one heaping 
teaspoonful flour rubbed into one tablespoonful butter, red and 
black pepper, salt and celery seed. 

Stew it long enough to cook the flour. Pour into a deep dish, 
cover with a plate, and put weights on it to press it. Eat cold, 
as souse. — Mrs. C. M. A. 

A French Dish. 

To two beef feet, put four gallons water ; set on the fire at

eight o'clock in the morning. When the bones have dropped 
off add the half of one large onion, two red peppers, and one 
sprig parsley, all chopped fine. 

Take another pot, put in two gallons water, in which cut 
up one-half gallon nice pieces of beef, half an onion, one red 
pepper, parsley, all chopped fine, and salt. When all has 
boiled to pieces, put all together and let it boil half an hour. 
Press as souse cheese. — Mrs. T. 

Brine for Beef. 

9 quarts salt. 
18 gallons water. 
2 pounds brown sugar. 
\ pound saltpetre. 
Boil and skim well. Let the beef get thoroughly cold, and let 
as much as possible of the blood be drained out before putting 
it in the brine. It may sometimes be necessary, in the course 
of a few months, that the brine be boiled and skimmed a second 
time. 

This quantity will suffice for about half of an ordinary sized 
beef.— iJ/rs. A, G, 

To Corn Beef. 

For every hundred pounds of beef, take : 
6 pounds salt. 
2 pounds brown sugar. 

2 ounces saltpetre. 

3 or 4 ounces soda. 
1 ounce red pepper. 

The whole to be dissolved in four gallons of water. The beef 
must be closely packed in a barrel, and the mixture poured over 
so as to cover it. Let it stand a week or ten days, or longer if 
the weather is cold ; then pour ofl' the brine, boil it, and skim 
off the blood. Let it cool, and pour back on the beef. War- 
ranted to keep. — Mrs. JDr. JS, 



TO COKN BEEF TONGUES AND BEEF. 155 

To Corn Beef Tongues and Beef. 
One tablespoonful saltpetre to each tongue or piece of beef; 
rub this in first, then a plenty of salt. Pack down in salt ; 
after it has remained ten or twelve days, put this, with a few 
pods of red pepper cut up fine, in a brine of only salt and water, 
which has been boiled, strained, and cooled, and strong enough 
to bear an egg. Wash a rock clean and place on the beef or 
tongues, to keep them under the brine. This will keep an 
indefinite length of time. Fit for use in two weeks. — Mrs. 
K T. 

To Corn Beef or Pork. 

50 pounds meat. 

4|- pounds salt. 

1|- pounds brown sugar. 

^ pound saltpetre, 

1 quart molasses. 
Mix well, boil and skim. When milk-warm, pour it over the 
meat with a ladle. The beef must be soaked in clear water and 
wiped dry, before putting in the brine. It will be ready for use 
in a few weeks. Should the brine mould, skim and boil again. 
Keep the meat under the brine. — Mrs. JP. W. 

To Pickle Tongue. 

Bub it well with salt and leave it alone four or five hours ; 
pour off the foul brine ; take two ounces saltpetre beaten fine, 
and rub it all over the tongue ; then mix one-quarter of a pound 
brown sugar and one ounce sal-prunella (the bay salt and sal 
prunella beat very fine), and rub it well over the tongue. Let 
it lie in the pickle three or four days ; make a brine of one gal- 
lon water with common salt strong enough to bear an egg, a 
half-pound brown sugar, two ounces saltpetre, and one-quarter 
of a pound bay salt. Boil one quarter of an hour, skimming 
well ; when cold put in the tongue ; let it lie in the pickle four- 
teen days, turning it every day. When ready to use take it

out of the pickle, or hang it in wood smoke to dry. — Mrs 
A. M. D, 

To Corn Beef. 

One tablespoonful saltpetre to each piece of beef, well rubbed 
in. Then rub in as much salt as it will take. Let it stand ten 
or twelve days, and then put it in strong brine. Will be ready 
for use in a week, — Mrs, Col. A. F. 

Corned Beef. 
Having a quarter of beef cut into proper size and shape 
for nice roasting pieces, put it in a barrel of weak brine and let 
it remain four days. Then make a brine that will bear an Qgg^ 
to which add : 

\ pound saltpetre. 
3 pounds brown sugar. 
Transfer the beef to this barrel, cover closely, and let it 
remain a week. Put a weight on the meat to insure its being 
kept under the brine. Beef thus prepared in January will keep 
well through the month of March, improving with the lapse of 
time. It is best served cold. A valuable receipt for country 
housekeepers. — Mrs. Wm. A. jS. 

Hunter's Beef, or Spiced Bound. 
To a round of beef weighing twenty -four pounds, take . 
3 ounces saltpetre. 
3 ounces coarsest sugar. 
1 ounce cloves. 
1 nutmeg. 
^ ounce allspice. 
3 handfuls salt. 
Beat all into the finest powder ; allow the beef to hang three 
or four days ; remove the bone, then rub the spices well into it, 
continuing tc do so every two or three days, for two or three 
weeks. 

When to be dressed, dip it in cold water, to take off the

loose spices, bind it up tightly and put into a pan with a tea- 
cupful water at the bottom. Sprinkle the top of the meat with 
suet, cover it over with a thick batter, and brown paper over it. 
Eake five hours.— J/r5. T. G. 

Hunter's Round, or Spiced Beef. 

To a round of beef that weighs twenty-five pounds, take the 
following : 

3 ounces saltpetre. 

1 ounce cloves. 

1 ounce nutmeg. 

1 ounce allspice. 

1 pint salt. 
Let the round of beef hang in a cool, dry place twenty-four 
hours. Take out the bone, and fill the space with suet and 
spices mixed. Rub the above ingredients all over the round / 
put in a wooden box or tub, turn it over occasionally and rub a 
small quantity of salt on it. Let it remain three weeks. Then 
make a stiff paste of flour and water, cover the round with it 
and set in the oven. Bake three hours slowly. Remove the 
paste when cold, and trim neatly the rough outside, and slice 
horizontally. Served only when cold. — Mrs. W. A.. S. 

To Spice a Round op Beef. 
Take three tablespoonfuls saltpetre, four tablespoonfuls brown 
sugar, with which rub your beef well. Two teacups of salt, 
one teacup of cloves, one teacup of allspice (the spice must be 
ground fine). Rub the beef with these ingredients. Put it 
into a tub as near the size of the beef as possible ; turn it every 
day in the pickle it makes. In about four weeks it will be 
ready for use. For thirty pounds use two pounds beef suet. 
When cooked place sticks across the bottom of the pot to pre- 
vent its burning. — Mrs. H. L. P. 

Spiced Beef. 
Take eight or ten pounds of the thin flank, remove any gris

tie, skin or bones ; rub it over with half ounce saltpetre, half 
ounce bay salt, then rub it well in with a mixture of spices, tho 
the following proportions being used : 

1 ounce black pepper. 

1 ounce allspice. 

^ ounce ground ginger. 

J ounce cloves. 

•^ ounce mace. 
Use only as much as will suffice to rub the beef all over ; then 
add three ounces common salt, and quarter of a pound coarse 
sugar. 

Let the beef remain a fortnight in this pickle, turning it and 
rubbing it every day : then take it out, cover it with the spices 
and chopped sweet herbs, roll it very tight, tie it with tape, put 
it into a pan with half-pint water, and half-pound suet. 

Bake it after the bread has been drawn, for six hours ; put a 
heavy weight upon it, and when cold take off the tape. 

To Cook a Corned Kound of Beef. 
Wash it clean of the brine, sew it in a coarse towel and boil 
six to eight hours. Do not remove the towel until next day ; 
it is nicer to put it in a round mould and gives it a good shape. 
When perfectly cold, trim nicely and cut it across the grain. — 
Mrs. P. W. 

To Cook Corned Beef-Tongue, etc. 
If the beef has been in brine long or has been dried, it must 
be soaked in cold water twelve hours before boiling. If freshly 
cured it is unnecessary. The beef should be put on in a large 
pot of water early in the morning and simmer for hours. Set 
the pot at the back of the range or stove, where it will gently 
boil during the preparation of dinner. When it first com 
mences to boil, take off the scum. After ifc is thoroughly done, 
take off the boiler or pot. Set away with the beef under the 
liquor to remain until next day, when it will be found juicy and

tender. With a sharp knife carefully trim, and garnish with 
scraped horseradish and curled parsley. — Mrs. 8. T. 

How TO Cook Corned Beef. 

The flank is a nice piece to corn ; though an ugly piece of 
meat, it can be made a nice and delicious dish. Wash the 
flank clean, roll it up as tight as you can, and tie it with strong 
cord in three places ; then sew it up in a coarse towel and put 
it on and boil from five to six hours, according to size ; take it 
out of the pot, but do not undo it, put it on a dish or pan and 
put a weight on it ; let it stand until next day, then remove 
the cloth and strings ; trim it, and you have a nice dish. — Mrs. 

JP. w. 

Smoked Beef. 
To a piece of beef weighing about twelve or fourteen pounds, 
you rub in the following : 
1 pint salt. 
1 cup brown sugar. 
1 cup molasses. 

■| teaspoonful pounded saltpetre. 
Bub this well on the beef and turn it several times. At the 
end of ten days drain it, rub bran on it, hang it up and smoke 
for several days. — Mrs. H. T. 

To Cure Beef for Drying. 

This recipe keeps the meat moist, so that it has none of thai 
toughness dried beef mostly has when a little old. To every 
twenty-eight or thirty pounds, allow one tablespoonful saltpetre, 
one quart fine salt, mixed with molasses until the color is about 
that of light brown sugar ; rub the pieces of meat with the mix- 
ture, and when done, let all stick to it that will. Pack in a keg 
or half-barrel, that the pickle may cover the meat, and let it 
remain forty-eight hours ; at the end of that time, enough pickle 
will be formed to cover it. Take it out and hang in a suitable 



160 TO CURE BEEF HAM — STEWED LOIN OF VEAL. 

place for drying. Allow all the mixture tc adhere to the meat 
that will.— J/rs. A. M. D. 

To Cure Beef Ham. 
Divide the ham into three parts ; rub on half-pint molasses ; 
let it remain in this molasses a day and two nights, turning it 
over occasionally during the time. Rub on then one handful 
salt and put it back in the vessel with the molasses ; turn it 
over, morning and night for ten days. Hang it up to dry for 
one week, then smoke a little. It is an excellent plan, after suf- 
ficiently smoked, to put each piece of beef in a bag, to protect 
from insects, and keep hanging till used. — Miss K. W. 

To Dry Beep and Tongue. 
The best pieces are the brisket, the round and rib pieces that 
are used for roasting. Put about the middle of February in 
brine. Bub first with salt, and let them lie for a fortnight, then 
throw them in brine and let them lay there three weeks, take 
them out and wipe dry : rub them over with bran and hang iu 
a cool place and dark, not letting them touch anything. Should 
there come a wet season, put them in the sun to dry a little. — 
Mrs. B. 

Stewed Loin of Veal. 

Take part of a loin of veal, the chump end will do. Put it 
into a large, thick, well-tinned iron saucepan, or into a stew-pan, 
add about two ounces of butter, and shake it over a moderate fire 
until it begins to brown ; flour the veal well over, lay it in a 
saucepan, and when it is of a fine, equal light brown, pour grad- 
ually in veal broth, gravy or boiling water, to nearly half its 
depth ; add a little salt, one or two sliced carrots, a small onion, 
or more when the flavor is liked, and one bunch parsley. 

Stew the veal very softly for an hour or rather more, then 
turn it and let it stew for nearly or quite another hour or 
longer, should it not appear perfectly done. A longer time

must be allowed when the meat is more than middling size. 
Dish the joint ; skim all the fat from the gravy and strain it 
over the meat, or keep the joint hot while it is rapidly reduced 
to a richer consistency. — ]\frs. tT, 

Yeal Chops. 
First beat until tender, then lay the chops in a pan, pour in 
just enough boiling water to barely cover them. Cover closely 
and simmer till tender, sprinkling over after they are nearly 
done, with a little pepper and salt. Lift from the pan, dry with 
a clean towel, butter them, then cover with beaten egg, and sift 
on cracker crumbs. Lay on a baking dish or pan and set in the 
stove to brown. Garnish and serve. — Mrs. 8. T. 

Roast Yeal. 
Plunge into boiling water, dry with a clean cloth ; rub well 
with pepper and salt, then with butter. Dredge with flour, 
and put into a pan with two teacups of boiling water, a slice of 
bacon or pork, minced onion and parsley, pepper and salt. Set 
in a hot oven ; simmer, baste and brown. Yeal is longer cook- 
ing than lamb. When a light brown, with a pin, stick on 
a buttered paper to prevent dryness. Thicken the gravy with 
brown flour, if brown gravy is wanted, but always with mashed 
Irish potato if white gravy is desired. — Mrs. S. T. 

Yeal Steak. 
First beat until it is tender, then without washing lay on a 
gridiron over coals ; turn over it a tin plate to prevent hardness 
and dr3rness. Turn the steak, and when well done, with a knife 
and fork press it and turn it in a pan or plate of hot melted 
butter. After putting in plate of hot butter and letting it 
absorb as much of the butter as possible, lay it on a dish, pep- 
per and salt it plentifully, and pour over the melted butter. 
(Set in the oven a few minutes, but not long enough for the 
butter to fry, which is ruinous to the flavor of steaks, game,

etc.) When done, sift over grated cracker. Garnish with pars 
ley and serve hot. — Mrs. S. T. 

Veal Cutlet. 

Cut the veal as if for steak or frying, put lard or butter in 
the pan, and let it be hot. Beat up an egg on a plate and have 
flour on another ; dip the pieces first in the egg, then in the 
flour, on both sides, and lay in the pan and fry until done, turn- 
ing it carefully once. This makes an excellent dish if well pre- 
pared. This way is superior to batter. — Mrs. D, 

yeal Cutlet. 

Cut it in pieces the size of your hand, and lay in salt water 
some little time. Take out and wipe dry. Put a small piece 
of lard in the pan and sprinkle the cutlet with a very little 
flour, pepper, and salt. Fry until nearly done. When it 
begins to brown, pour off the lard, and pour in a little water, 
one large spoonful butter, and a little celery-seed. Turn it over

Veal Cutlets. 

Trim smoothly and beat till tender, sprinkle over pepper 
and salt; then with a spoon spread over an egg beaten till 
thick, and cover thickly with pounded cracker. 

Have some hot lard ready in the frying-pan, put the cutlets on 
to fry, with the prepared side down ; when of a light yellow 
brown, dress the other side the same way and fry, keeping 
closely covered. When they are perfectly done (veal should 
never be rare), place in a hot dish; pour one teacup o! 
milk, one small piece of butter, pepper, salt, and minced onion 
and parsley into the pan, stirring constantly. When it boils 
up, pour into the dish and garnish with parsley. Always sift 
browned cracker over such dishes. — Mrs. JS. T,

Cold Yeal Dressed with White Sauce. 

Boil one pint milk and thicken it a little with one teaspoon- 
ful flour, wet with cold water. When well boiled, put in 
very thin slices of veal, and simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. 

Have the yolk of an egg well beaten up, and add to the meat, 
also a piece of butter. 

Let it boil up once, stirring all the time, and serve it on 
toasted slices of bread. A few slices of bacon, cut thin and 
fried to a crisp, make a good relish with this dish. — Mrs. G. P, 

Minced Veal. 

Cut some slices of cold veal into small bits or dice ; take the 
cold gravy and add to it a half-pint of boiling water, one tea- 
spoonful tomato or walnut catsup, the grated peel of one lemon, 
pepper and salt. 

Simmer it with the meat slowly for half an hour ; then add 
half a teaspoonful flour made into a thin batter and pour it 
into the gravy, stirring it rapidly. Boil for ten minutes ; turn 
in one-half cupful cream, or same quantity of milk with a small 
piece of butter ; let it boil up. Serve on a hot platter garnished 
with sippets of fried bread. — Mrs. P,

Veal Loaf. 

Two and a half pounds meat taken from fillet or shoulder, or 
wherever the meat is free from fat. Take out all the little 
white, fi.brous or sinewy particles, and chop very finely, almost to 
a paste. Mix in rolled cracker crumbs with one egg to hold it 
together, a little butter, red and black pepper, and salt to taste. 

Form into a small loaf; dredge with the cracker crumbs, and 
put several little pieces of butter over the outside. Set this loaf 
uncooked, with about one quart water or some broth, in a pan ; 
put it in the oven and baste constantly for two hours, and when 
taken out to cool, pour any remaining liquid over the loaf. It 
ought to cut in slices and be quite compact — no caverns in the 
inside of the loaf. — Mrs, G, P. 

Yeal Cake. 

Take one and a half pounds veal, and half a pound of bacon, 
stew together with very little water, a little salt and pepper, 
thyme and parsley. 

When the veal is tender, cut into small square pieces, as also 
the bacon. 

Boil four eggs hard and slice them up, and chop some raw 
parsley fine. 

Take a mould or small bowl, lay the slices of egg in a kind 
of pattern prettily at the bottom of it. Sprinkle the parsley 
between the slices. Add veal, bacon, and more egg alternately, 
pepper and salt to taste, and a little grated lemon-peel, also some 
more parsley, and so on until the bowl is nearly-full. Fill up 
with the gravy the veal was boiled in, which ought to be very 
rich. Let it stand until quite cold, then turn out on a flat dish. 
The slices cut firmer and more solid when the cake is made the 
day beforehand, which it is best to do if the weather permits,

MUTTON AND LAMB. 

When the weather will admit of it, mutton is better for 
being kept a few days before cooking. The saddle, which is 
considered the finest piece, consists of the back or loin and 
upper part of the hind legs. In getting this nice roast, however, 
you spoil the hind quarter, as the saddle takes some of the 
nicest parts of this and leaves it too dry to cook by itself. The 
hind quarter and loin together make a very nice dish — the 
latter being fat and juicy. 

The fore quarter is sometimes cut by taking ofi" the shoulder 
and taking the rib-piece, making a piece called the brisket or 
breast, and many persons esteem this the choicest part of the 
mutton. The ribs cut next to the back are used for mutton 
chops. 

When you have a large supply of mutton on hand, it is well 
to put the hind quarters in brine, as you can thus corn them as 



TO ROAST MUTTON ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 169 

nicely as beef. As mutton spoils easily, this plan is very ad- 
visable. 

Whilst boiled mutton is very nice, lamb is spoiled by this 
mode of cooking. If lamb is to be roasted, it should be cover- 
ed with the caul, as the fat, dripping from this, will preserve 
the moisture of the meat. 

In carving the fore quarter of lamb, first take off the shoul- 
der and then cut the ribs in strips. 

Lamb is seldom cut except in quarters, and when nicely cook- 
ed there is nothing better. It should be four months old before 
being eaten. The season for lamb is from May to August, 
whilst that for mutton is from August to Christmas. 

To Roast Mutton. 
The hind quarter is the nicest part of the mutton to roast, and 
requires longer to cook than lamb. Put it in a pot of boiling 
water and let it simmer one hour. Lift it into a baking-pan, 
rub with salt and pepper (too much salt makes the meat tough). 
Kub over it a little lard and then dredge with flour : skim off 
the top of the water and pour over it. Set it in a hot oven, 
basting frequently to prevent it from being hard and dry ; roast 
till thoroughly done. This is nice to set aside for a cold dish, 
garnished with horseradish and eaten with currant jelly. — Mrs. 

P. W. 

KoAST Leg of Mutton. 

Choose young and tender mutton. Take off the shank — wash 
it well; let it lie fifteen or twenty minutes in salt water to 
take the blood out. Rub with little salt and pepper well. 
Lay on a grate, which will go nicely in a baking-pan, over one 
pint boiling water ; break the bones of the shank in the water, 
adding more pepper and salt. Set it in a very hot oven, and 
baste frequently to prevent it from being hard and dry. When 
it is of a light brown, cover with sheets of buttered paper. 
Place it on a dish ; add minced parsley to the gravy, which 
should be brown. Cover the roast with grated brown cracker

Roast Saddle of Mutton. 
Trim the joint carefully, roast it at a brisk, clear fire ; baste 
frequently, and when done dredge it plentifully with salt, and 
serve with the gravy well freed from fat. 

To Boil a Leg of Mutton. 
Make a paste of flour quite plain, mixed stiff with water, roll 
out as for a meat pudding ; break and turn in the shank bone ; 
then cover the leg of mutton carefully with the paste ; tie up 
tight in a well- floured cloth. Have ready sufficient boiling 
water, place in the joint, allow ten minutes for checking the 
boiling, and twenty minutes for each pound of meat. Carefully 
remove the paste, which can be done by one cut longitudinally 
and one cut across. Strain the gravy and serve as usual. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. 
Dip a cloth in hot water, tie up the mutton and put in boil- 
ing water. Boil slowly for two hours, or longer, if not kept 
constantly boiling. — Mrs. R. 

Broiled Mutton. 
After a leg of mutton has been washed and wiped dry, place 
in a cloth that has been dipped in boiling water. Roll it up, pin 
and tie securely ; put in a pot of boiling water. Let it simmer 
several hours, removing the scum that rises when it first begins 
to boil. If a small leg of mutton, it will require a shorter time 
to cook than a large one. Just before it is done, add enough salt 
to season it properly, half an onion, and one heaping teaspoonful 
of black pepper. When this has properly seasoned the meat, take 
from the fire, unwrap and drain. Serve with drawn butter, 
adding capers or nasturtium seed, or if you have neither, use

chopped sour pickle instead. Mutton should always be served 
with caper sauce, if possible. — Mrs. /S. T. 

To Cook a Saddle of Mutton. 

Meats are all better for being kept a day or two before cook- 
i]ig, particularly mutton. If the mutton be tender, do not boil it, 
but put it in a pan of water, set it on the stove, and cook 
slowly, basting constantly with the gravy or water in the pan ; 
with pepper and salt to taste. Just before it is done, put some 
scraped horseradish over it, and garnish the dish with the 
same; add a little ground mustard and grated bread or cracker; 
pour the gravy over it, and grate bread over, and set aside to 
cool. This is for cold mutton. All meats are better for roast- 
ing before a fire than in a stove. — Mrs. P. W. 

Saddle of Mutton. 

This should be covered with paper, and carefully roasted or 
baked. Season with a little pepper and salt; garnish with 
horseradish. 

Iced Saddle of Mutton. 
Reserve the drippings from the meat when it is roasting. 
After the saddle is nicely cooked, let it get cold. Then take 
the white part of the gravy and melt it to the consistency of 
cream. Pour this over the saddle until it is covered with a 
white coat ; if it appears rough, warm an iron spoon and pass 
over it until it is smooth. Place it on a dish, and dress the 
dish all round with vegetable flowers and curled parsley, using 
the parsley to ornament the saddle also. — Mrs. Judge B. 

To Corn Mutton. 
Mutton being less apt to keep than other meat, it is well, 
when you lj;;ve an over-supply, to corn it exactly as you would 
corn beef. —Misa R. S.

Lamb's Head. 

Boil the head and liver, but so as not to let the liver be too 
much done. Take up the head, split it through the bone, which 
must remain with the meat on. Cut the meat across and 
across with a knife, grate some nutmeg on it and lay it on a 
dish before a good fire ; then throw over it some grated bread 
crumbs, some sweet herbs, some allspice, a little lemon peel 
chopped fine, a very little pepper and salt. Baste it with 
butter, and dredge a little flour over it. 

Just as it is done, take one-half the liver, the lights, the 
meat, the tongue ; chop them small with six or eight spoonfuls 
water or gravy. First shake some flour over the meat and stew 
it together; then put in the gravy or water, a good piece of 
butter rolled in a little flour, pepper and salt, and what runs 
from the head in the dish. Simmer all together a few minutes, 
and add half a spoonful of vinegar ; pour it on the head. Lay 
the head on the centre of the mince-meat ; have ready the other 
half of liver, cut in pieces and fried quickly with slices of bacon 
and lemon; lay these around the dish and serve. — 3fr8. T.

POULTRY. 



In summer, kill and dress the poultry the day beforehand, 
except chicken for frying, which is not good unless killed the 
same day it is eaten. 

The best way to kill a fowl is to tie it by its legs, hang it up, 
and then cut ofl" its neck. In this way, it dies more quickly, 
sufiers less, and bleeds more freely. 

It is best to pick fowls dry ; though, if you are pressed for 
time, you may facilitate the picking of chickens, as well as of 
partridges and other small birds, by putting them first into 
water, hot, but not boiling. Then take off the feathers carefully, 
so as not to break the skin. Never scald a turkey, duck or 
goose, however, before picking. 

To draw the crop, split the skin of all poultrj'' on the back of 
the neck. Pull the neck upward and the skin downward, and 
the crop can be easily pulled out. Then cut ofi" the neck close 
to the bodv, leaving the skin to skewer at the back of the neck 
after the aressing has been put in. Make an incision under 
the rump lengthwise, sufficient to allow the entrails to be easily 
removed. Be careful not to break the gall, and to preserve the 



POULTRY. 177 

liver whole. Cut open the gizzard, take out the inner skin, 
and wash both carefully. Wash the bird inside several times, 
the last time with salt and water. Some persons object to 
using water inside or outside, but I consider it more cleanly to 
wash the bird first and then wipe it dry with a clean towel. 
It should then be hung with the neck downwards till ready to 
cook. 

The head, neck, and feet, after being nicely washed and the 
bones in them broken, should be stewed in the gravy, as they 
make it much richer. 

It is said that throwing chickens into cold water immediately 
after they have finished bleeding, and allowing them to remain 
there ten or fifteen minutes, will make them deliciously tender, 
which can be accounted for scientifically. Frozen fowls or game 
should be thawed gradually, by being laid in cold water. If 
cooked without being thawed, it will require double time, and 
they will not be tender nor high-flavored. 

The tests by which you may tell the age of a turkey are 
these. An old turkey has rough and red legs, and if a gobbler, 
long spurs, while young turkeys have black legs, and if gobblers, 
small spurs. The fatter they are and the broader their breasts, 
the bettei-. When dressed, the skin should be a yellowish 
white, and, if tender, you may easily rip it with a pin. If, 
when you bend back the wings, the sinews give and crack, 
this is another test of the turkey being young, and the same 
test will apply to other fowls. The bill and feet of an old 
goose are red and hairy. A young goose has pen feathers and 
its flesh is whiter than that of an old one. 

If young, the lower part of a hen's legs and feet are soft and 
smooth, while a young cock has small spurs. When dressed, 
the flesh should be white and the fat a pale yellow. Turn the 
wing back, and if the sinews snap it is a sign the chicken is 
young. 

A few words on the subject of carving may not be out of 
place here. A sharp knife, with a thin and well tempered 
8* 



178 ROAST TURKEY. 

blade is essential to good carving. In carving a turkey, cut off 
first the wing nearest to you, then the leg and second joint, 
then slice the breast till a rounded, ivory-shaped piece appears. 
Insert the knife between that and the bone, and separate them. 
This part is the nicest bit of the breast. Next comes the 
merry-thought. After this, turn over the bird a little, and just 
below the breast you will find the oyster, which you will sepa- 
rate as you did the inner breast. The side bone lies beside the 
rump, and the desired morsel can be taken out without separat- 
ing the whole bone. Proceed with the other side in the same 
way. The fork need not be removed during the whole process. 
Chicken and partridges are carved in the same way. 

Roast Turkey. 
Wash nicely in and out. Plunge into boiling water ten min- 
utes. Have ready a dressing of 

Bread crumbs. 

Hard boiled eggs, chopped fine. 

1 tablespoonful butter. 

Minced parsley, thyme and celery. 
After rubbing the cavity well with salt and pepper and put- 
ting in a slice of pork or bacon, fill with the above dressing. 
Do the same also to the crop, so as to make the turkey look 
plump. E.ub the turkey well with butter and sprinkle salt and 
pepper over it. Dredge with flour. Lay in the pan with a 
slice of pork or bacon and a pint of boiling water. Lay the 
liver and gizzard in the pan with it. Put in a hot oven, bast- 
ing and turning frequently till every part is a beautiful brown. 
When the meat is amber color, pin a buttered sheet of writing 
paper over it to keep it from becoming hard and dry. Cook 
three or four hours. Season the gravy with minced parsley and 
celery and serve with cranberry sauce. — Mrs. S. T.

the insides. Make a dressing of bread soaked in cold water, 
drained and mashed fine, a small piece of melted butter or 
salt pork chopped, pepper and salt, sweet herbs, a hard boiled 
egg, chopped fine. 

Any kind of cooked meat is good, minced fine and added to 
the dressing. The body and crop must be filled with the dress- 
ing and sewed up. The giblets ought to be boiled tender, if 
they are to be used. Use the water in which they are boiled, 
for gravy, adding a little of the turkey drippings, seasoning 
with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs, and thickening with a little 
flour and water, mixed smoothly. Place where it will boil. 

When the fowl is put on to roast, put a little water into the 
dripping-pan. At first it should be roasted slowly and basted 
frequently. Tie up the wings and legs before roasting, and rub 
on a little butter and salt. Serve with drawn butter. — Mrs. W. 

Roast Turkey. 

Put the gizzard, heart and liver in cold water and boil till 
tender. When done, chop fine and add stale bread, grated, salt 
and pepper, sweet herbs, if liked, two eggs well beaten. 

Fill the turkey with this dressing, sew the openings, drawing 
the skin tightly together. Put a little butter over the turkey 
and lay it upon the grate of your meat-pan. Cover the bottom 
of the pan well with boiling water. In half an hour, baste the 
turkey by pouring over it the gravy that has begun to form in 
the pan. Repeat this basting every fifteen minutes. In an 
oven of average temperature, a twelve-pound turkey will re- 
quire at least three hours' cooking.— il/rs. A. D. 

Roast Turkey, with Truffles. 
Truflles must be peeled, chopped and pounded in a mortar ; 
one and a half pound will do for one turkey. Rasp the same 
amount of fat bacon and mix with the truffles and stuff the 
turkey with it. This dressing is usually placed in the turkey 
two days beforehand, to impart its flavor to the fowl. Lay

thin slices of fat bacon over the breast of the turkey, cover it 
with half a sheet of white paper, and roast two hours. Chest- 
nuts dressed in the same way as truffles are found an excellent 
substitute. — Mrs. S. G. 

Boiled Turkey. 

Wash well with cold water, then put on in milk-warm water, 
either tied in a coarse cloth dredged with flour or with a half- 
pound of rice in the water. Keep well under water, and boil 
slowly three hours, adding salt just before it is done. When 
perfectly done and tender, take out of the pot, sprinkle in the 
cavity a little pepper and salt, and fill with oysters stewed just 
enough to plump them, and season, with butter, pepper, salt 
and vinegar. Place in a dish and set in a steamer to keep hot. 
Strain the liquor in which the oysters were scalded, add drawn 
butter, chopped celery, parsley and thyme; pour over the turkey, 
and serve. If not convenient to use oysters, use egg and butter 
sauce. Garnish with sliced lemons. — 3Irs. S. T. 

JBoiled Turkey. 
Prepare the turkey as for roasting. Tie it in a cloth or boil 
rice in the pot with it, if you wish it to look white. It is im- 
jjroved by boiling a pound or two of salt pork with it. If soup 
is made of the liquor, let it stand till next day and skim the 
fat. Season after heating. — Mrs. TFi 

To Steam a Turkey. 
P^ub butter, pepper and salt inside the turkey after it has 
been well washed, fill with oysters, sew up, lay in a dish and set 
in a steamer placed over boiling water. Cover closely and 
steam from two hours to two and a half. Take up, strain the 
gravy which will be found in the dish. Have an oyster sauce 
ready, prepared like stewed oysters, and pour into it this gravy 
thickened with a little butter and flour. Let it come to a boil 
and whiten with a little boiled cream. Pour this over the

steamed turkey and send to the table hot. Garnish with sliced 
lemons. — Mrs. S. T, 

Turkey Hash. 
Cut up the meat very fine. Stew the bones in a little water, 
then stir into this water the meat, adding a large tablespoonful 
butter, a cup of cream, salt and pepper, a little chopped parsley, 
thyme or celery (or else a very few celery-seeds). Stew all 
together. — Mrs. M. 

Devilled Turkey. 

Place the legs and wings (jointed) on a gridiron. Broil 
slowly. Have ready a sauce made of — 

1 tablespoonful pepper vinegar. 
1 tablespoonful made mustard. 
1 tablespoonful celery sauce. 
1 tablespoonful acid fruit jelly. 
A little salt and pepper. 
Lay the broiled turkey on a hot dish. Pour the dressing 
and sift pounded cracker over it. — Mrs. S. T. 

Potato Stuffing for Turkeys and other Fowls. 
Mash smoothly six good -sized boiled Irish potatoes. Chop a 
small onion very fine and fry a light brown, in a frying-pan, 
with a dessertspoonful lard. Then add the potatoes with salt 
and pepper, and a lump of butter as large as a walnut. To this 
add one well beaten Qgg., stirring till perfectly dry. If for geese 
or ducks, add a little sifted sage and a small quantity of red 
pepper. — 3Irs. McG. 

Boned Turkey. 

The turkey must be full grown, moderately fat, and picked 
dry. Do not remove the entrails. Cut off the neck about one 
inch from the body. Take oif the wings above the second joint 
and cut off the legs as usual. With a sharp jDointed knife, 
split the skin from the end of the neck to the rump. Bun the 
knife between the bones and flesh on one side, till you come to 



182 BONED TURKEY. 

where the wing and leg join the body. Twist the wing and 
raise it, cracking the joint. Separate it from the body. Then 
proceed with the leg in the same way, on the same side. Run 
the knife between the bones and flesh till you reach the breast 
bone. Repeat this on the other side. Take out the craw. 
Carefully run a sharp knife under the rump, detaching it from 
the bone without cutting the skin, as it must come off with the 
flesh. Hold the turkey by the neck and pull the skin carefully 
down, until the upper part of the breast bone is uncovered. 
Cut the flesh from the bone on both sides, till the end of the 
bone is nearly reached. The turkey mxist now be laid on the 
back and held by the neck, the front of the turkey being toward 
you. Take hold of the skin of the neck with the left hand, 
pulling downwards with a knife in the right hand, separate the 
skin from the end of the bone. The whole of the turkey is now 
detached from the carcass. Lay it on a table with the skin 
down. Pull the bones from the wings and legs, first running 
the knife around so as to leave the flesh. Pull out all the ten- 
dons of the legs. Push them and the wings inside. Cut off 
the ring under the rump. All this must be done slowly and 
carefully. Have ready a half-dozen slices of salt pork, and a 
salad made of shoat, veal or lamb, chopped and seasoned, as 
turkey salad, with celery, etc. Mix with this salad three or 
four large Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed, with a spoonful of 
butter. Now lay the turkey ou the table, inside up and the 
neck from you; pepper and salt it; lay three or four slices of 
pork on it, then a layer of the salad ; pork again and salad 
alternately until filled ; draw the two sides together and sew 
it up, giving it as near as possible its proper shape. Sew it up 
carefully in a cloth, place in a kettle of the proper shape, 
cover with boiling water, adding the broken bones, three pounds 
fresh lean beef, parsley, thyme, onions and two dozen whole 
black peppercorns, with salt to the taste. Simmer three hours, 
then take it from the water and remove the towel. Carefully 
remove all discolorations and settlings of the water from the

turkey. Scald a clean cloth, wrap it up again ; pla ie it on its 
back, put a dish over it with a weight on it and set it in a cool 
place till next day. Unwrap and remove the twine with which 
it was sewed. Glaze it with a little meat jelly ; just before 
the jelly congeals sift over a little cracker browned and 
pounded; decorate with meat jelly and serve. Directions for 
preparing meat jelly follow. — Mrs. S. T, 

Meat Jelly for Boned Turkey. 

As soon as the water in which the turkey was boiled is cold, 
take off all the fat and strain it, put it in a porcelain-lined 
kettle ; two ounces gelatine, three eggs, with shells, a wine- 
glass of sherry, port or madeira wine ; stir well. Add one 
quart of the strained liquor; beat rapidly with an egg-beater, 
put it on the fire and stir until it boils. Simmer ten or fifteen 
minutes. Sprinkle in a pinch of turmeric and strain just as 
any other jelly. When congealed break it up and place around 
the turkey. Cut some in thick slices and in fanciful shapes 
with paste cutters. Place some of these lozenges over the 

turkey and border the edges of the dish with them. — Mrs, 
jS. T. 

Chickens. 

These, whether for boiling or roasting, should have a dress- 
ing prepared as for turkeys. Six spoonfuls of rice boiled with 
the chickens will cause them to look white. If the water is cold 
when they are put in, they will be less liable to break. They 
are improved by boiling a little salt pork with them. If not 
thus boiled, they will need salt. 

For broiling, chickens should be split, the inwards taken out, 
and the chickens then washed. Broil very slowly till done, 
placing the bony side down ; then turn it and brown the other 
side. Forty minutes is the medium time for broiling a chicken. 

For roast hicken, boil the gizzard and liver by themselves, 
and use the water for gravy. — Mrs. Col. Wl

KoAST Chicken. 

Oliicken should never be cooked tlie same day it is killed. 
Wash well with cold water, then pour boiling water over it and 
into the cavity. E,ub the latter with salt and pepper, and fill 
with a dressing made of bread soaked in water and squeezed 
out, a tablespoonful butter, a little salt, pepper and parsley. 

Rub the chicken well with butter. Sprinkle pepper and salt 
over it and dredge with flour. Lay it into a pan with a slice of 
pork or bacon and a pint of water. Let it simmer slowly two 
hours, basting and dredging frequently. Turn the chicken so 
each part may be equally browned. Add chopped thyme and 
parsley to the gravy. 

Some persons think ground ginger a more delicate flavoring 
for the dressing than pepper. — Mrs. jS. T. 

To Boil Chicken. 

Never boil the same day the chicken is killed. Soak them 
overnight in weak salt and water. Place in a kettle of water, 
with a handful of rice and a little milk to make the chicken 
white. Simmer slowly two or three hours, removing the scum 
that rises when the chicken first begins to boil. Keep under 
the water, with an inverted deep plate. Just before taking ofl" 
the fire, add salt to the taste. Lay on a hot dish near the fire. 
Skim off the fat from the top of the liquor, strain it and add 
chopped celery, parsley and thyme, drawn butter, a little pep- 
per and salt, or, if preferred, six hard-boiled eggs chopped fine. — 
Mrs. 8. T. 

To Steam Chicken. 

Soak two hours, in salt and water, a fat young pullet. Drain 
and dry. Rub in the cavity a little salt and pepper and a large 
lump of butter. Fill with large, plump oysters, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and sew up. Lay the chicken on a dish or pan, 
and set it inside a steamer, which close and keep over boiling 
water four hours. When thoroughly done, lay on a dish and

pour over it drawn butter or celery sauce. Garnish with curled 
parsley, and serve. — 3frs. S. T. 

Smothered Chicken. 

Kill the day before it is smothered. Split open the back, as 
if to broil. When ready to cook, wipe dry with a clean towel, 
rub well with butter and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Put 
in a pan with a slice of bacon or pork and a pint of water. 
Simmer an hour or more, basting frequently. When thoroughly 
done, place on a hot dish. 

Stir into the gravy remaining on the fire a beaten egg, mixing 
it carefully. Pour this into the dish, but not on the chicken. 
Sift over it cracker, first browned and then pounded. Garnish 
with parsley, and serve. — Mrs. JS. T. 

Stewed Chicken. 

Cut up the chicken as if to fry, adding the prepared head 
and feet. Soak in weak salt and water. If for dinner, do this 
immediately after breakfast. 

An hour and a half before dinner, put in a saucepan, cover- 
ing well with water. Let it simmer slowly for one hour. Take 
it out with a fork and lay in a bowl. Add a teacup milk and 
half a teaspoonful black pepper to the liquor. Let it boil up 
and strain on the chicken. Pinse the saucepan and return all 
to the fire. Beat one egg with a tablespoonful of flour and one 
of milk until quite smooth. Mince some parsley, thyme, and a 
very little onion, and stir all into the saucepan. Then put in 
a tablespoonful of butter. Stir around and pour into a dish 
in which small pieces of toast have been neatly arranged. Gar- 
nish with curled parsley. — Mrs. S. T. 

Stewed Chicken. 
Cut up and lay in salt and water. Put them in water 
enough to cover them, with some slices of middling. Let them 
boil till nearly done. Then put in the dumplings, made like

biscuit but rolled thin, and let them boil till done. Roll a 
piece of butter in flour, with pepper, salt, chopped parsley and 
celery, or a little celery-seed. When the gravy is thick enough, 
pour in a teacup of cream or milk, and let it boil up once. 
Take off the fire and serve hot. — Mrs. Col. W. 

Fried Chicken. 

This dish is best when the chicken is killed the same day it 

is fried. Cut off the wings and legs, cut the breast in two, and 

also the back. "Wash well and throw in weak salt and water, 

to extract the blood. Let it remain for half an hour or more. 

Take from the water, drain and dry with a clean towel, half an 

hour before dinner. Lay on a dish, sprinkle a little salt over 

it, and sift flour thickly first on one side and then on the other, 

letting it remain long enough for the flour to stick well. Have 

ready on the frying-pan some hot lard, in which lay each piece 

carefully, not forgetting the liver and gizzard. Cover closely 

and fry till a fine amber color. Then turn over each piece and 

cover well again, taking care to have the cliicken well done, 

yet not scorched. Take the chicken up and lay in a hot dish 

near the fire. Pour into the gravy a teacup of milk, a teaspoon- 

ful of butter, a saltspoon of salt, and one of pepper. Let it 

boil up and pour into the dish, but not over the chicken. Put 

curled parsley round the edge of the dish and serve. — Mrs, 
8. T, 

Fried Chicken. 

Kill the chicken the night before, if you can, and lay on ice, 
or else kill early in the morning. When ready, wipe dry, flour 
it, add pepper and salt, and fry in a little lard. When nearly 
done, pour off the lard, add one-half teacup water, large spoon- 
ful butter, and some chopped parsley. Brown nicely and 
serve. Meal mush fried is nice with the chicken. — Mrs. 
ColW. 

To Dress Chickens with Tomatoes. 

Fry till a light brown. Then add some tomatoes, cut in

small pieces, with the juice. Strain the tomatoes from the seed, 
season them with salt, pepper, a little sugar, and let them stew. 

—Mrs. j: b. n. 

To Fricassee Chicken. 
Wash and joint the chicken; place the pieces in a ste.w-pau 
with the skin side down. Sprinkle salt and pepper on eHch 
piece. Add three or four slices of pork, stew till tender, take 
them out and thicken the liquor with flour, and add a piece of 
butter the size of a hen's egg. Replace the chicken in the pan 
and let it stew five minutes longer. When it is taken up, soak 
in the gravy some pieces of toast, put them on plates and lay 
the chicken on the toast, pouring the gravy over it. To brown 
the chicken, stew till tender, without the pork ; brown the pork, 
take that up, then put in the chicken and fry a light brown. — 

Mrs. Col. W. 

To Broil Chicken. 

Kill the chicken the day before using, split open in the back, 
nicely clean, and, if the weather is warm, slightly sprinkle 
with salt. If for breakfast, half an hour before press between 
the folds of a clean towel till dry, grease well with fresh butter, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt and lay on a gridiron, over hot 
coals, with the inside of the chicken down. Let it cook prin- 
cipally from this side, but turn often till the outside of the 
chicken is of a bright, yellow brown. When thoroughly done, 
pour over it melted butter, sprinkle pepper, and sift pounded 
or grated cracker. — M-rs. S. T. 

Chicken Pie. 

Cut up the chicken and place in a deep oven with one largo 
spoonful of lard. Let it brown a little and add one onion, pars- 
ley, thyme, sage and black pepper, to suit the taste. Pour on 
it a cupful boiling water, stir well and let it simmer till well 
cooked. Just before taking from the fire, rub together :

To EoAST Goose. 

A goose must never be' eaten the same day it is killed. If 
the weather is cold, it should be kej^t a week before using. 
Before cooking let it lie several hours in weak salt and water, 
to remove the strong taste. Then plunge it in boiling water, 
for five minutes, if old. Fill the goose with a dressing made of : 

Mealy Irish potatoes, boiled and mashed fiue. 

A small lump of butter. 

A little salt or fresh pork chopped fine. 

A little minced onion. 

Parsley, thyme, and a pinch of chopped or powdered sage. 

Grease with sweet lard or butter. Lay in a pan with the 
giblets, neck, etc. Pour in two teacups of boiling water, 
set in a hot oven, and baste frequently. Turn so that every 
])art may be equally browned. Serve with gravy or onion 
sauce. 

The above recipe will answer equally as well *for duck. — 
Mrs. 8. T. 

Devilled Goose. 

Plunge the goose into a pot of boiling water and let it remain 
half an hour. Fill with a stufling made of : 

Mashed Irish potatoes, a heaping tablespoonful butter, minced 
onions, sage, parsley and thyme, half a teaspoonful black pepper. 

Place it in a pan with a slice of fat pork and a pint of broth 
or liquor in which any kind of meat has been boiled. 

Mix two tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar, celery vinegar, made

mustard, and one of acid fruit jelly. Butter the breast of the 
goose and pour this mixture over it, adding salt and pepper to 
the taste. 

Place in a hot oven, dredge with flour and baste frequently 
till done ; when serve with its own gravy. This receipt will 
answer equally as well for wild goose. — Mrs. jS. T. 

To Prepare Young Ducks. 
Kill and hang to drain. Plunge, one at a time, in boiling 
water, then immediately in cold water, which makes them easier 
to pick. Kill some days before using, or if obliged to use them 
the same day as killed, they are better roasted. — Mrs. H. 

To Stew Ducks. 
Truss the ducks and stuff them with bread, butter, and onion. 
Flour them and brown them in lard. Have prepared slips of 
bacon, giblets, onion, water, pepper, salt, and a little clove or 
mace, if you like. Put in the ducks and let them stew gently 
but constantly for two hours. Then add the juice of green 
grapes or of a lemon, or else a little lemon pickle. Flour the 
ducks each time you turn them, and thicken with butter rolled 
in flour. — Mrs. Col. W. 



SALADS. 



In making salads, be careful to add the vinegar last. Where 
oil cannot be obtained, fresh butter, drawn or melted, is an 
excellent substitute and is indeed preferred to oil by some per- 
sons, epicureans to the contrary notwithstanding. Always 
use good cider vinegar in making salads, as chemical vinegar is 
sometimes very unwholesome. Much depends on the rotation 
in which you mix the ingredients for a salad, so I would call 



OYSTER SALAD SALMON AND LOBSTER SALAD. 191 

particular attention to the directions given on this point on the 
subsequent pages. 

Oyster Salad. 

^ gallon fresh oysters. 

The yolks of four hard-boiled eggs. 

1 raw egg, well whipped. 

2 large spoonfuls salad oil or melted butter. 
2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls black pepper. 
2 teaspoonfuls made mustard. 

1 teacup good vinegar. 

2 good sized pickled cucumbers, cut up fine. 

Nearly as much celery as oysters, cut up into small dice. 

Drain the liquor from the oysters and throw them into some 
hot vinegar on the fire ; let them remain until they are plump^ 
not cooked. Then put them at once into clear cold water; 
this gives them a nice plump look and they will not then shrink 
and look small. Drain the water from them and set them away 
in a cool place, and prepare your dressing. Mash the yolks as 
fine as you can and rub into it the salt, pepper, and mustard, 
then rub the oil in, a few drops at a time. When it is all 
smooth, add the beaten egg, and then the vinegar, a spoonful at 
a time. Set aside. Mix oysters, celery, and pickle, tossing up 
well with a silver fork. Sprinkle in salt to your taste. Then 
pour dressing over all. — Mrs. E. P, G. 

Salmon and Lobster Salad. 

If the salmon salad is made of the fish preserved in cans, 
drain it from the oil and mince the meat fine. Cut up one 
third as much lettuce or celery. 

For one box of salmon, boil four eggs hard ; lay them in cold 
water a few minutes, shell and separate the whites from the 
yolks ; lay the whites aside. Mash the yolks smooth with two 
tablespoonfuls sweet olive oil or one teacup sweet rich milk or

cream. The oil makes the smoothest and best paste. Dissolve 
in one teacup vinegar, 

1 tablespoonful sugar. 

1 teaspoonful salt. 

2 or more teaspoonfuls fine mustard. 
Pepper to the taste. 

Mix this with the paste and toss lightly over the meat with 
a silver fork. Ornament the dish in which it is served with 
the green leaves of the celery, or with curled parsley and the 
whites of eggs cut in rings. 

Lobster salad is prepared in the same way. Take the nicest 
parts of the lobster. — Mrs. C. G. 

Lobster Salad. 

Chop up one can of lobsters ; cut in small pieces as much 
celery. Then cream with'one teacup butter, one tablespoonful 
mustard, one tablespoonful sugar, one teaspoonful salt, and 
yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, rubbed smooth ; stir in five 
tablespoonfuls pepper vinegar (simply pepper steeped in vine- 
gar and sweetened with a little sugar), and pour the mixture 
over the lobster and celery. — Mrs. S. T. 

Fish Salad, 
Boil four flounders, or any medium sized fish ; when done, 
take off the skin and pick out the bones, then shred very fine. 
Add pepper and salt, one tablespoonful mixed mustard, a half 
cup vinegar, and half a pound butter, and mix all well with 
the fish. Put into shallow pans, set in the oven and bake ten 
minutes. When cold piit over it a little Worcestershire sauce, 
and sherry wine. — 3Iiss JF'. JV. 

Terrapin Salad. 

Boil them until the shells will come off easily and the nails 
pull out ; then cut into small pieces and carefully remove the 
sand-bag and gall. 



TUEKET SALAD. . 193 

To three good sized terrapins, take six hard-boiled eggs ; re- 
move the yolks and rub into a powder with half a pound sweet 
butter. When creamy and light, add one teaspoonful flour. 
Put this with the meat into a saucepan ; season with cayenne 
pepper and salt, and let it boil for one or two minutes. Just 
before taking from the fire, add wine to taste, and if desired, a 
little mace. 

Be careful to remove the skin from the legs. — Mrs. A. 

M.D. 

Turkey Salad. 

Mince the turkey very fine. Have ready the following mixt- 
ure, for a large company. 

Twelve or fourteen eggs boiled hard ; mash the yolks smooth 
with one spoonful water ; add to it pepper, salt, and mustard to 
the taste. Two teaspoonfuls celery-seed, one teacup of fresh 
melted butter or fine olive oil, and pour in strong vinegar to the 
taste. 

Mix the turkey and celery, and pour over the mixture just 
before eating. — Mrs. F. C. TK 

Turkey Salad. 

Kemove the skin and fat from a turkey ; mince the meat 
fine. 

Mince 2 or 3 slices lean ham. 

2 or 3 bunches celery. 

3 or 4 apples. 

3 or 4 cucumber pickles ; mix well together. 
Prepare a dressing of the yolks of four eggs, rubbed in a little 
thick cream. 

4 tablespoonfuls butter. 

2 teaspoonfuls black pepper. 

2 teaspoonfuls salt. 

2 teaspoonfuls of mustard. 

Vinegar to the taste.

194 TUEKET SALAD CHICKEN SALAD. 

Turkey Salad, 

Boil two turkeys till well done, pick out all the bones, skin 
and fat, and cut up the balance in small pieces. 

Boil one dozen eggs hard, let them cool, then separate the 
yolks and whites, mash the yolks fine, chop the whites very fine 
and set them to one side. 

Have a large flat dish, in which put four large spoonfuls 
mixed mustard ; pour in a little oil, and with a fork rub it 
in till smooth, then a little vinegar, in which has been melted 
two full tablespoonfuls of salt, then oil, and alternately put in 
oil and vinegar, each time rubbing it in till well mixed. When 
you have mixed a whole bottle of oil and one pint vinegar till 
it is as smooth as butter, add one heaping teaspoonful cayenne 
pepper, three teaspoonfuls celery-seed rubbed fine in a mortar, 
and one large mango cut fine, put in stuffing and all. 

Have ready as much celery as you have fowl, cut fine, mix 
meat and celery carefully together, and pour the dressing over 
all.— Jfrs. E, I. 

Chicken Salad. 

One large chicken boiled ; when cold remove the skin and 
chop into a dish, over which throw a towel slightly dipped in 
cold water to keep the meat moist. When the celery is cut, 
put between clean cloths to dry. ' 

Take one tablespoonful best mustard, the yolk of one raw 
egg, which drop into a dish large enough to hold all the dress, 
ing ; beat well for ten minutes and slowly add to the mustard 
one tablespoonful vinegar.

One pound of fresh suet, one ounce ready dressed veal, oi 
chicken chopped fine, bread crumbs, a little shallot or onion, salt 
and pepper (white), nutmeg ; parsley and thyme, finely shred. 

Beat as many eggs, yolks and whites separately, as will make

Mince with Bread Crumbs. 
Chop up any kind of cold meat very fine, place in a baking 
dish a layer of bread crumbs, seasoned with lump of butter,

butter size of an egg. 

After removing all tough, gristly pieces from the cold cooked 
meat, chop it fine with some boiled potatoes. Put them in the 
dressing, heat through, then serve. It injures meat to cook 
it again, making it hard and unpalatable. Should you have 
any cold gravy left, use it; in that case you will require less 
butter, salt and pepper. You can serve it with buttered toast 
underneath, or you may set it into the oven to brown on top,

EGGS. 

Properly cooked, eggs are very wholesome and nutritious diet. 
Always be certain, however, that they are fresh, before attempt- 
ing to make a dish of them. Some persons use Krepp's family 
egg-tester, to ascertain if an egg is sound. Full directions, as to 
the mode of using it, accompany the egg tester ; so it is imneces- 
sary to give them here. A simple mode of testing the sound- 
ness of an egg, is to put it in water ; and if fresh it will sink to 
the bottom. 



boiled eggs — egg cups, a breakfast dish. 233 

Boiled Eggs. 
Let the water be boiling when you put the eggs in it, and let 
the eggs boil three minutes after putting them in. — Mrs. S. T. 

Soft-boiled Eggs. 
Put the eggs in a large tin cup or any tin vessel convenient. 
Pour boiling water over them, and let them remain near the 
fire, five minutes. Do not let them boil. Eggs cooked thus 
are slightly jellied throughout. They can be kept hot without 
becoming hard. — Mrs. S. T. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Beat four eggs very light. Add a teacup milk, thickened 
with a teaspoonful flour. Have the pan very hot, put in a

butter and a little salt. Stir till done. — Mrs. J3, 

Eggs for Breakfast. 

Heat in the oven a common white dish, large enough to hold 
the number of eggs to be cooked, allowing plenty of room for 
each. Melt in it a small piece of butter, break the eggs, one 
at a time, carefully in a saucer, and slip them in the hot dish. 
Sprinkle over them pepper and salt, and let them cook four or 
five minutes. It is a great improvement to allow to every two 
eggs a tablespoonful of cream, adding it when the eggs are first 
put in. — Mrs. A. M. D. 

Egg Cups — A Breakfast Dish. 
Boil some eggs perfectly hard. Halve them, take out the 
yolks, which mix smoothly with some finely chopped or ground 
ham or fowl, salt and pepper, and a few spoctf^uls melted butter

mixture, and set inside an oven to bake a light brown. Serve 
immediately. — Mrs. JT. D.

salted, spreading them over the whole surface. Run a knife care- 
fully around the edges, and turn into a heated dish when done. 



236 POACHED EGGS — HAM AND EGGS.

with the yolks before pouring into the pan. — Mrs. M, C. G. 

Poached Eggs. 

Let the eggs be perfectly fresh, and the pan at least two 
inches deep in boiling water. Break the eggs carefully, just 
over the water or in a spoon, so that they may be slipped into 
the water with their shape preserved. Take them up in a large 
perforated spoon, cover with fresh melted butter and sprinkle 
with salt — never pepper, as some persons do not use it, and it 
mars the appearance of the dish. — Mrs, S. T.

Slice the ham rather thick. Fry in a hot pan. Before it 
becomes hard, take from the pan and lay in a dish over a vessel 
of hot water.

hot, that it may cook the eggs nicely when dropped into it. 
Break the eggs carefully, drop them in whole, and do not let 
them touch each other. Cook a light brown, not allowing 
the yolks to get hard. Lay an egg on each sKce of meat,—

bits of butter on each egg and bake. — Mrs. D. P, 



238 VEGETABLES — TO COOK: ASPARAGUS. 

VEGETABLES. 

If possible, use vegetables gathered early in the morning, with 
the dew on them. It is even better to gather them late the 
evening before, with the evening dew on them (setting them in 
the ice-house or some cool place), than to gather them after the 
morning sun has grown hot. If you are living in the city, get 
your vegetables from market as early in the morning as possible. 

As soon as gathered or brought from market, all vegetables 
should be carefully picked over, washed, placed in fresh water, 
and set in a cool place till the cook is ready to put them on for 
dinner. 

Put them on in water neither cold nor boiling hot. The slow 
heating that takes place when you put them on in cold water 
deprives them of their flavor, to some extent, whilst too rapid 
heating toughens the vegetable fibre. 

Just before they are thoroughly done and tender, add suffi- 
cient salt to season them. Do not stir them and mutilate them 
with a spoon, but turn them into a colander and drain. Place 
them in a hot dish and put a large tablespoonful of fresh butter 
over them. 

In cooking dried peas and beans, as well as corn, put up in 

brine, always soak them the overnight,, These vegetables 

should first be parboiled, whether they are to be used for soup 

or for side dishes. 

To Boil Green Peas. 

Early in the morning, either buy the peas from market or 
have them gathered in your garden, while the dew is on them. 
Shell and lay in cold water till half an hour before dinner. Then 
put in boiling water and boil steadily a half hour. Add a little 
salt, just before taking from the fire. Drain, add a heaping 
tablespoonful fresh butter and put in a covered dish. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Cook Asparagus. 
As soon as you get the asparagus from market or your gar-

den, throw into salt and water, after scraping the outer skin 
and tying up in bunches. Put on to boil one hour before din- 
ner. After boiling thirty minutes, drain, cut in pieces half an 
inch long, and put in the saucepan with enough milk to cover 
them. Just before serving, add one tablespoonful fresh butter, 
in which one teaspoonful flour has been rubbed. Season with 
salt and pepper. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Cook Asparagus.

improvement. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Bake Onions. 
Boil six onions in water, or milk and water with a seasoning

ful salt. 

Lay a large lump of ice on top, and garnish with curled par- 
sley ; which, eaten after onions, is said to remove the scent from 
the breath. — Mrs. S. T, 

Radishes. 

As soon as taken from the ground, put in cold water. Then 
put red and white radishes alternately in a dish of fanciful de- 
sign, ornamenting with curled parsley, in the centre and around 
the edges. — Mrs. tS. T. 

Celery. 

Wash carefully and put in cold water to keep crisp till din- 
ner. Remove all the green, as nothing is so ornamental as the 
pure white leaves of bleached celery. If the ends of the stalks 
have been broken, split and curl them. — Mrs. JS. T, 

To Boil Snaps. 

Early in the morning, string round, tender snaps. Throw

the frying pan, prepare the other side the same way. Return 
to the pan and fry it a pale brown. — Mrs. /S. T. 

Cymlings Fried with Bacon.

PICKLES AND CATSUPS. 

For pickles and catsups, use the best cider vinegar, it being 
not only more wholesome than other kinds of vinegar, but 
the only sort that will keep pickles or catsup for any length of 
time. 

In making catsup, or in scalding pickles in vinegar, if a brass 
kettle is used, it must be scoured with sand and ashes, washed 
and wiped dry, and then scoured with vinegar and salt. By 
attending to these directions, the brass kettle maybe safely used 
—though the pickles or catsup must be poured from it the 
instant it is taken from the fire, or they will canker. 

In making pickles, it is a good rule to allow two pounds of 
sugar to each gallon of vinegar for sour pickle, though a larger 
proportion must be allowed for sweet pickle. 

Vinegar for pickling should be spiced and set to sun from 
spring to autumn. Never put pickle in a jar that has been 
used for butter or lard. Examine often to see if the pickle is 
well covered with vinegar, and if any of it has turned soft, 
remove it. Keep it in a dry, airy closet, and be careful not to 
let it freeze. Pickle is generally considered best when from six 
months to a year old. Some housekeepers use the same vine- 
gar (with a slight addition) from year to year, by draining the 
pickle as they take it out of the jar.

all, and cover with^cold vinegar. If necessary, add more vine- 
gar after it has stood awhile. — Mrs. C. JS'. 

Green Pickle. 
Put the pickles in a strong brine, strong enough to bear an 
egg. Three weeks is long enough for them to remain in brine, 
if you wish to make your pickle early in the fall ; but they will 
keep several months, indeed all the winter, by having them 
always well covered with the brine. 

When ready to make your pickle, drain off every drop of 
brine, and pour boiling water over the pickles. Repeat this for 
three mornings in succession. Then pour off this last water, 
and soak the pickles two days in cold water, changing the 
water each morning. Next, pouring off this water, scald the 
pickles three mornings in weak vinegar, weakening the vinegar 
by putting two quarts of water to one of vinegar. This is the 
time for greening the pickles, by putting in the jar or keg a 
layer of pickle, then sprinkling in a little powdered alum, and 
so on, till the vessel is filled ; then pouring on the weakened 
vinegar. Only use the alum the first morning ; but the other 
mornings pour off the vinegar and pour on a fresh quantity. 
All this is necessary, if you wish to have pickle perfectly free 
from the brine, and in a condition to keep. Fill your jars with 
the pickle thus prepared, and pour over them the best of vin- 
egar, after seasoning it and letting it boil a few minutes. Sea-

304: CAKE. 



CAKE. 



Before commencing to make cake, be sure that you have all 
the ingredients in the house, and all the implements at hand, 
such as trays, bowls, large dishes, large strong iron spoons, egg- 
beaters, etc. 

Use none but the best family flour in making cake. It is a 
good plan to sift it before weighing or measuring it, and to let 
it air and sun several hours before using it ; as this makes it 
much lighter. 

It is a great mistake to set aside rancid or indifferent butter 
for cake-making. The butter used for the purpose should be 
good and fresh. 

Always use granulated sugar or else powdered loaf or cut 
sugar ; as pulverized sugar is apt to have plaster of Paris or 
other foreign elements in it. Never use brown or even clarified 
sugar in cake-making, unless it be for gingerbread. 

Do not attempt to make cake without fresh eggs. Cream of 
tartar, soda and yeast powders are poor substitutes for these. 

A fresh egg placed in water will sink to the bottom. 

In breaking eggs, do not break them over the vessels in which 
they are to be beaten. Break them, one by one, over a saucer, 
so that if you come across a defective one, you will not spoil 
the rest by mixing it with them ; whereas, if it is a good one, 
it will be easy to pour the white from the saucer into the bowl 
with the rest of the whites, and to add the yolk which you re- 
tain in the egg-shell to the other yolks. 

The Dover egg-beater saves much time and trouble in beat- 
ing eggs and will beat the yolks into as stiff a froth as the 
whites. It is well to have two egg-beaters, one for the yolks 
and the other for the whites. Eggs well beaten ought to be as 
stiff as batter. Cool the dishes that you are to use in beating 
eggs. In summer, keep the eggs on ice before using them, and 



WHITE CAKE— SUPEEIOR WHITE CAKE. 305 

always try to make the cake before breakfast, or as early in the 
morning as possible. 

Some of the best housewives think it advisable to cream the 
butter and flour together, and add the sugar to the yolks when 
these are whipped to a stiff froth, as it produces yellow specks 
when you add the sugar sooner. The whites must always be 
added last. 

In making 'fruit cake, prepare the fruit the day before. In 
winter time, this may be easily and pleasantly done after tea. 
It requires a longer time to bake fruit cake, than plain. Every 
housekeeper should have a close cake-box in which to put cake 
after cooling it and wrapping it in a thick napkin.

ropes. Have ready the whites of thirteen eggs well beaten. 
When the sugar is boiled sufficiently, pour it into a deep bowl, 
occasionally stirring it gently, until you can just bear your fin- 
ger in it ; then add the beaten egg all at once, beating it very 
hard for half an hour, when it is ready for use. Strain into the 
icing the juice of one lemon into which the peel has been grated, 
for half an hour.— Jfrs. F. C. W.

strained juice of a large lemon with a few drops of oil of lemon, 
and beat again ; in all beat half an hour. If too stiff add a lit- 
tle more white of egg. Some persons put it on with a knife, 
but it is far smoother and more evenly spread over the cake if 
put on with a large spoon. Dip up a spoonful of the icing and 
pour it from the spoon over the cake. Pour it over the top of 
the cake and it will diffuse itself down the sides. To color icing 
yellow, steep the rind of an orange or lemon in the lemon juice 
before straining it into the icing. To make it pink, put in 
strawberry or cranberry juice with the lemon juice. — Mrs. S. T,

PUDDINGS — ^PLIJM PUDDING. 305 

PUDDINGS. 

The directions given for cake apply likewise to puddings. 
Always beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately and 
very light, and add the whites just before baking or boiling. 
All puddings (except those risen with yeast), should be baked 
immediately after the ingredients are mixed. Thick yellow 
earthenware dishes are better than tin for baking puddings, 
on several accounts. One is that the pudding, to be good, must 
be baked principally from the bottom, and tin burns more easily 
than earthenware. Another reason is, that the acids employed 
in some puddings corrode and discolor tin. Garnish the pud- 
ding with sifted white sugar, and with candied or preserved 
orange or lejnon peel. 

In boiliug a pudding, cold water should never be added. 
Keep a kettle of hot water to replenish the water in the pot as 
it boils away. As soon as the pudding is done, remove it from 
the boiling water. A decrease in heat whilst cooking, makes 
boiled pudding sodden, and makes baked pudding fall. The 
best sauce for a boiled pudding is cold sauce made of the frothed 
whites of eggs, butter, sugar, nutmeg, and a little French 
brandy, while for a baked pudding, a rich, boiled wine sauce is 
best.

Rich Plum Pudding. 

Nine eggs beaten to a froth. 

Add flour sufficient to make a thick batter, free from lumps. 
Then add one pint of new milk and beat well. Afterwards add 
the following ingredients, in small quantities at a time, keeping 
it well stirred. 

Two pounds stoned raisins, two pounds currants, well washed, 
picked, and dried. One-quarter pound bitter almonds, blanched 
and divided ; three-quarters pound brown sugar ; three-quarters 
pound beef suet, chopped fine ; one nutmeg, grated fine ; one 
teaspoonful of ground allspice, the same of mace and cinna- 
mon. 

This pndding should be mixed several days before cooking, 
then well beaten, and more milk should be added, if required. 
Make this into two puddings, put in cotton bags and boil four 
hours. By changing the bags, and hanging in a cool, dry place, 
they will keep six months and be the better for it. Steam and

PASTRY. 

Pastry has fallen somewhat into disfavor, on account of its 
unwholesome properties, but as many persons still use it, we 
will give some directions for making it as wholesome and palat- 
able as possible. 

It is a great mistake to use what is called " cooking butter " 
and old lard for pastry. Only fresh butter and sweet lard should 
be employed for the purpose, and in summer these should be 
placed on ice before being used for pastry. Pastry, like cake, 
should be made in the cool of the morning, and it should be 
eaten fresh, as, unlike cake, it will not admit of being kept. 

If a marble slab cannot be obtained, it is well to keep a thick 
wooden board exclusively for rolling out pastry. Handle as 
little as possible, and if anything should prevent you from put- 
ting it on to bake as soon as it is rolled out, put it on ice in the 
interim, as this will make it nicer and more flaky. Sometimes 



EXCELLENT RECIPE FOE PASTRY — PUFF PASTE. 405 

there is a delay about getting the oven or fire ready, in which 
case the cook generally leaves the pastry lying on the kitchen 
table ; but its quality would be much improved if it were put on 
the ice instead, whilst waiting to be baked. 

Excellent Recipe for Pastry. 

Four teacups flour, one teacup firm butter, one teacup nice 
lard, one teacup ice water, one teaspoonful salt. Mix the lard 
and butter in the flour with a large, flat knife, then add the ice 
water. Do not touch it with the hands. Take it up in a rough- 
looking mass, roll it out quickly — not too thin. Cut it with a 
very sharp knife around the edges of the patty-pans. When 
intending to bake lemon puddings or cheese-cakes, let the pastry 
bake four or five minutes before adding butter, as this prevents 
the pastry from being heavy at the bottom. In summer it is best 
to put five teacups of flour, instead of four. — Mrs. M. G. C. 

Pastry. 

One pound fresh butter, one quart flour. Make up the dough 
with ice water. Divide the butter into parts. Koll out, and 
cover thickly with one part of the butter. Continue till all is 
rolled, sifting flour each time. Don't handle much, or it will be 
heavy. — 3Irs. W. 

Pastry. 

Mix with water one quart flour and two teaspoonfuls salt. 
Work well and roll out thin. Spread over with lard, sift flour 
over the dough, and cut it in strips of two inches. Lay them 
in a pile one above another, cut them in squares, and again pile 
them up. Press down with the hands, and roll out thin as 
before. Repeat this several times, and the pastry will be im- 
proved each time. Do not use your hands after the roller is 
applied. 

Puff Paste. 

One pound flour, to be made up with cold water and beaten 
fifteen minutes. One pound butter (or half lard, if you have 



406 LEMON PIE. 

not enougli butter), which must be spread on the dough four 

times and rolled in. 

It must be made thin, put in tins, and baked in a moderate 

oven.

two tablespoonfuls corn-starch into two teacups hot water, and 
boil, stirring well. Add three-quarters of a pound of granu 
lated sugar. When cool, add the yolks of four eggs well beaten, 
then the lemon-juice and grated rind, stirring the whole well 
together. Line the plates with rich pastry, and pour the mixt- 
ure in. Bake until the crust is done. Beat the whites of the 
eggs very light, add six ounces powdered sugar, pour over the 
pies, set them again in the oven, and slightly brown. This will 
make two pies. — Mrs. T. M. G. 

Lemon Pie.

flour. Bake in a paste. After it is cold, spread on the whites 
of the eggs, frothed and sweetened. — Mrs. Mc G-,

Almond Cheese Cakes. 

Soak one-half pound Jordan almonds in cold water all night. 
Next morning, blanch them in cold water, lay them on a clean 
cloth to dry, and then beat them fine in a marble mortar with a 
little orange-flower or rose water. Then beat and strain six 
yolks and two whites of eggs, add a half-pound white sugar, and 
a little powdered mace. Rub all well together in the mortar. 
Melt ten ounces fresh butter, and add a grated lemon peel. 
Mix all the ingredients and fill the pans, after putting a paste at 
the bottom. Small tin shapes are best for cheese cakes.

French Fritters. 

One quart of milk (half to be boiled, and the other half 
mixed with a quart of flour, and used to thicken the boiling 
milk with). 

Let it get done. While cooking, beat ten eggs very light ; 
add a spoonful at a time to the batter, beating all the time, till 
well mixed. Add salt to your taste. Have a small oven full 
of nice lard, boiling hot. Put not quite a spoonful of batter to 
each fritter. Take them out before they turn dark and put 
them in a colander to drain the lard off of them. — Mrs. Dr. E. 

Fritters {made with yeast). 
One quart flour, three tablespoonfuls yeast, five eggs, one pint 
milk. Beat into a tolerably stiff batter. Stir a cupful of 
boiled rice into the batter, a short time before baking. A good 
deal of lard (boiling hot) is required for frying the fritters. 
Drop the batter in with a spoon, which must be dipped, each 
time, in boiling water. In cool weather, make the fritters 
about nine in the morning, in the summer, about eleven. — 
Mrs. A. G. 

Bell Fritters. 

Put a pint of boiling water in a preserving kettle, and as it 
boils, put in a tablespoonful of fresh butter. Have ready a pint 
of the best flour, sifted and wet with cold water, as for starch. 
Dip up some of the boiling water and pour to this, being care- 
ful to have it smooth. Return this to the kettle, stirring 
rapidly to prevent lumps. Turn into a wooden tray, and while 
hot, beat in six well beaten eggs, a spoonful at a time. Beat 
till very light, and beat quickly that the eggs may not cook in 
lumps. Have ready a pint of boiling lard in a pan. Make the 
fritters the shape of an egg, drop in and fry a light brown. 

To be eaten with a pint of molasses, a heaping tablespoonful

of butter, a little ginger and cinnamon, boiled to a thick syrup 
and served hot. 

A great deal of lard is required to fry fritters nicely ; yet it is 
not extravagant, as it may be used again. Strain what remains 
and put it by for use. — Mrs. S. T. 

Quire of Paper Pancakes. 
Mix with half a pint of rich milk the yolks of four eggs, 
well beaten. Add three tablespoonfuls fine flour, four ounces

JELLY, BLANC-MANGE, CHAELOTTE KUSSE, 
BAKED CUSTARD, CREAMS, ETC. 

Jelly made of the feet of calves, hogs, etc., is more trouble- 
some, but is also considered more nutritious than jelly made of 
gelatine. It is very desirable, for country housekeepers in par- 
ticular, to make this sort of jelly, as the materials are generally 
in their reach. It is well, however, in all cases, to keep on 
hand Cox's or Nelson's gelatine, on account of the expedition 
with which jelly may be made from these preparations. 

As jelly is considered more wholesome when not colored by 
any foreign substance, no directions will be given in the subse- 
quent pages for coloring it. The palest amber jelly, clear and 
sparkling, flavored only by the grated rind and juice of a lemoii 
18* 



4:18 JELLY BLANC-MANGE, OHAELOTTE EUSSE. 

and pale Madeira or sherry wine, is not only the most beautiful, 
but the most palatable jelly that can be made. 

Though the recipes accompanying boxes of gelatine do not 
always recommend boiling, it is a great improvement to jelly, 
adding brilliancy, transparency, and a better flavor. Only the 
grated yellow rind and strained juice of the lemon should be 
I used, and these, with the requisite quantity of pale Madeira or 
sherry, should be added after the other ingredients have been 
well boiled together. The white rind or one single lemon seed 
will render the jelly bitter. A delicious preserve (for which 
a receipt is given under the proper heading), may be made of 
lemons, after the yellow rind has been grated off and the juice 
pressed out for jelly. 

The best and most simple arrangement for straining jelly is to 
invert a small table, fold an old table-cloth four double, tie each 
corner to a leg of the table ; set a bowl under the bag thus 
formed, with another bowl at hand to slip in its place when the 
jelly first run through is returned to the bag, as will be neces- 
sary, the first never being transparently clear. Catch a little in 
a glass. If clear as crystal, it will be unnecessary to return it 
again to the bag. You may then put a thick cloth over the bag 
to keep in the heat, and if in winter, place before a fire. Shut 
up the room, and let it drip. The jelly will run through the 
bag more rapidly if the bag is first scalded. 

Jelly should never be made in hot weather. Ices are much 
better and more seasonable. 

Always serve jelly with a pitcher of whipped cream, but do 
not mix it beforehand with the cream, as it is best to leave it to 
the taste of each person. 

For blanc-mange and gelatine, it is best to use gelatine and 
as few spices as possible, as spices turn gelatine dark. As such 
explicit directions are given in the subsequent pages for the 
making of these dishes, it is unnecessary to say anything further 
on the subject at present. 

A nice custard is made in the following manner : Mix the 



STOCK JELLY — OALVES' FOOT JELLY. 419 

beaten yolks of six eggs with a teacup of sugar. Have a quart 
of milk boiling in a kettle. Dip up a teacup of milk at a time 
and pour on the eggs, till the kettle is emptied, stirring rapidly 
all the time. Wash out the kettle, pour the mixture back, and 
stir constantly till it thickens. Then pour it into a bowl and 
stir till cool, to make it smooth and prevent it from curdling. 
Put in the bottom of glass mugs slips of preserved orange, 
lemon, or citron. Fill nearly full with custard ; put whipped 
cream and grated nutmeg on top. 

Or, the yolks may be mixed with boiled milk and sugar in the 
same proportions, but instead of being returned to the kettle, 
may be poured into china or earthenware custard-cups, set in a 
pan of boiling water, placed in a stove or range, and baked. 
The boiled milk must be seasoned by boiling a vanilla bean iu 
it, or a few peach leaves, or it may be flavored with caromel. 
Serve the custard with whipped cream on top. 

Stock Jelly. 

To one and a half gallons of stock, put the whipped whites of 
eighb eggs. Put in six blades of mace and the rind of three 
lemons, 4|- pounds sugar. Let it boil ten minutes, then add three 
pints of Madeira wine, juice of eight lemons, a little vinegar or 
sharp cider. Let it boil only a few minutes. Strain through a 
dripper. If the stock is not very nice, it may require the 
whites of one dozen eggs to clear it. — Mrs. T. 

Calves' Foot Jelly. 

One quart nice jelly stock, one pint wine, half a pound white 
sugar, whites of four eggs beaten up, three spoonfuls lemon 
juice. Boil all well and pass through a jelly-bag, kept hot 
before the fire. Try some at first, till it drips clear, and then 
pour out the whole. Peel the lemons as thin as possible and 
strain the jelly on the peelings. Should you wish to turn ou* 
the jelly in moulds, put one ounce isinglass to three pints of 
jelly.— ilfrs. L H.

ICE CREAM AND FEOZEN CUSTAED. 

After having tried many new and patent freezers, some of the 
best housekeepers have come to the conclusion that the old- 
fashioned freezer is the best. It is well, however, to keep a 
patent freezer on hand, in case of your wanting ice cream on 
short notice ; but for common use an old-fashioned one is the 
best, especially as servants are so apt to get a patent freezer out 
of order. 

The great secret of freezing cream quickly in a common 
freezer is to have the cream and salt in readiness before break- 
ing the ice into small pieces the size of a walnut. There must 
be a space of two inches between the freezer and the tub in 
which it is set. Put a little ice and salt under the bottom of 
the freezer, then pack alternate layers of ice and salt several 
inches higher than the cream is in the freezer. If there is no 
top to the tub, with an aperture to admit the freezer, pin a 
woollen cloth over it and turn the freezer rapidly. When the 
cream begins to harden on the sides of the freezer, cut it down 



ICE CREAM ANB FROZEN CUSTARD. 431 

with a knife, scrape from the sides, and beat with a large iron 
spoon. Then cover again, and turn rapidly till it is as hard 
as mush. When the ice begins to melt, drain oif the salt and 
water, adding more salt and ice, which must be kept above the 
level of the cream in the freezer. When done, tie large news- 
papers over the tub and freezer. Put a woollen cloth or blanket 
over these, and set the cream in a dark, cool closet till wanted. 
In this way it may be kept for hours in summer, and for daya 
in winter, and will grow harder instead of melting. As cream 
can be kept thus, it is well to make it early in the day and set 
it aside, leaving more leisure for other preparations that are 
better made immedia,tely before dinner. 

Ice cream making, like other branches of housekeeping, is 
much facilitated by having all the ingredients at hand before 
beginning on it. As such explicit directions for the process 
are given in the subsequent pages, it is unnecessary for me to 
add anything further on the subject. Unless you have pure 
cream to freeze, it is better to make plain boiled custard rather 
than to attempt an imitation of ice cream. 

It is a good plan to make jelly and custard at the same time, 
so that the yolks of eggs not used in the jelly may be utilized in 
custard either boiled or baked. The same proportions are gen- 
erally used for boiled and baked custard. Instead of flavoring 
with extract of vanilla, it is much better to boil a vanilla bean 
in the milk, or to boil some peach leaves tied vip in a piece of 
muslin (six or eight leaves to a quart of milk), or to flavor it 
with burnt sugar. Never flavor custard with extract of lemon, 
when you can obtain fresh lemons for the purpose. 

When you have no yolks left from making jelly, boil a quart 
of milk (flavored by the above directions). Have ready three 
eggs, whites and yolks beaten together to a stiff froth, and into 
these stir a teacup of powdered white sugar. Dip up the boil- 
ing milk, pour slowly on the eggs, stirring rapidly. When all 
the milk has been stirred in the eggs, wash out the kettle, put 
the milk and eggs back into it, and let the mixture boil till it

begins to thicken, when it must be taken immediately from the 
fire, poured into a bowl, and stirred till cold and smooth. 

Many persons, before freezing, stir in the frothed whites of 
three eggs. The same directions given for freezing cream apply 
to the freezing of custard. 

Boiled custard should never be used as a substitute for cream 
in making fruit ice creams, nor should it ever be eaten with 

jelly. 

Ice Cream. 

Dissolve five teaspoonfuls Oswego starch or arrow-root in a 
teacup milk. Add to it the whites of three eggs well frothed, 
and the yolk of one, well beaten. 

Sweeten with loaf sugar and boil half a gallon new milk. As 
soon as it begins to boil, pour it in small quantities over the 
mixture of eggs and starch, til] about half the milk is taken out 
of the kettle. Then pour all back in the kettle and stir a few 
moments. After it cools, add one quart rich cream ; season to 
the taste and freeze. — 3Irs. Dr. E.

One quart milk, two eggs, one teaspoonful corn starch, one 
teaspoonful arrow-root. A small lump of butter. — Mrs. E. JB. 

Ice Crea/m. 

Cream one tablespoonful butter from which the salt has been 
washed. Add three tablespoonfuls corn starch. Dissolve this 
in half a gallon new milk, heated, sweetened and seasoned. 
Beat the whites of four eggs, and stir in just before freezing. — 
Mrs. Mg G. 

Lemon Ice Cream. 

One gallon rich cream, six lemons, first rubbed till soft, and 
then grated. Tie the yellow peel, which has been grated ofi*, in 
a piece of coarse muslin. Cut each lemon in half and squeeze 
the juice from it. Strain the juice, and soak the muslin bag of

lemon peel in it, squeezing it frequently till it becomes highly 
flavored and~colored by it. Then add two teacups of sugar. 

In sweetening the cream, allow a teacup of sugar to each 
quart. Pour the juice into it slowly, carefully stirring. Froth 
and freeze, reserving a portion of cream to pour in as it sinks 
in freezing. — Mrs. S. T. 

Orange Ice Cream. 

Four oranges, one gallon cream. Rub four or five lumps of 
sugar on the orange peel, squeeze the juice out, put the lumps 
of sugar in it and pour into the cream. Sweeten heavily with 
pulverized sugar before freezing. — Mrs. M. 

Strawberry Cream. 

Four quarts thick sweet cream, four quarts strawberries. 
The berries must be mashed or bruised, caps and all, with a 
teacup of granulated sugar to each quart. After standing 
several hours, strain through a thin coarse cloth. 

Put four teacups of white sugar to the cream, and then add 
the juice of the berries. Whip or froth the cream with 
a patent egg- whip • or common egg-beater. Pour two-thirds of 
the cream into the freezer, reserving the rest to pour in after it 
begins to freeze. Raspberry cream may be made by the same 
recipe.— J/rs. S. T. 

Peach Cream. 

Take nice, soft peaches, perfectly ripe. Pare and chop fine, 
make them very sweet, and mash to a fine jam. To each quart 
of peaches, add one pint of cream and one pint of rich milk. 
Mix well and freeze. If you cannot get cream, melt an ounce 
of Cox's gelatine in a cup of water. Boil the milk, pour it on 
the gelatine, and when cold, mix with the peaches. — L. D. L.

if convenient ; if not, use the common egg- whip. Then peel 
soft, ripe peaches till you have about two quarts. As you peel, 
sprinkle over them two teacups powdered white sugar. !Mash 
quickly with a silver tablespoon, or run through a colander, if 
the fruit is not soft and ripe. Then stir into the whipped 
Oream, and pour into the freezer, reserving about one-fourth to 
add when the cream begins to sink in freezing. When you add 
the remainder, first cut down the frozen cream from the sides 
of the freezer. Beat hard with a strong iron spoon, whenever 
the freezer is opened to cut down the cream, till it becomes too 
hard. This beating and cutting down is required only for the 
common freezer, the patent freezer needing nothing of the kind. 

Tie over the freezer large newspapers, to exclude the air, and 
set aside till wanted. 

Apricot cream may be made exactly by this receipt. — Mrs, 
jS. T. 

Pineapple Ice Cream. 

Whip two quarts rich, sweet cream to a froth, with two tea- 
cups powdered white sugar. Use a patent egg-whip with a 
wheel, if convenient ; if not, use the common egg- whip. 

Grate two ripe pineapples, and add to them two teacups 
white sugar. When well mixed, stir into the cream. 

Pour into the freezer, reserving one-fourth. When it begins 
to freeze, it will sink ; then beat in the remainder with a strong 
iron spoon. Beat every time the freezer is opened to cut down 
the cream from the sides. Never cook fruit of any sort to make 
cream.— il^frs. S. T.

the bowl with any handsome, glossy leaves convenient, and 
serve with cream. — Mrs. /S. T. 



STRAWBEEBIES ^PRESERVES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 443 

Strawberries 

Should never be washed unless sand or earth adheres to 
them. Cap carefully while the first course is being served, or, 
if more convenient, you may cap in the morning, but never 
sweeten till just before eating, as sweetening long beforehand 
extracts the juice and makes the fruit tough. Set it on ice, or 
in a refrigerator. No ice must be put on fruit. Serve with 
cream that has been set on ice. Decorate the edges of the bowl 
with strawberry leaves. 

The same directions will apply to raspberries, blackberries, 
and dewberries. Whortleberries may be washed, picked, and 
drained, though not sweetened till dinner. — Mrs. S. T. 



PEESERYES AND FRUIT JELLIES. 

Always make preserves in a porcelain or brass kettle. If the 
latter, have it scoured first with sand, then with salt and vine- 
gar. Then scald it and put in the sugar and water for the 
syrup. 

In peeling fruit, throw it into cold water to keep it from 
turning dark, and let it remain there till you are ready to 
throw it in the boiling syrup. Bear in mind that exposure to 
the air turns peeled fruit dark. 

Boil rather quickly. In preserving fruit whole, boil it a 
short time in the syrup, take it out, let it get cold, and then 
put it again in the kettle. 

Cut sugar is best for preserves which you wish to be clear 
and light-colored, but nice brown sugar is best for dark-colored 
jams and marmalades, such as those made of blackberries, rasp- 
berries, whortleberries, etc. 

The best peaches for preserving, brandying, or pickling, are 
white freestone peaches, not quite ripe enough to eat with 



444: SWEETMEAT PEESEEVES. 

cream. Pears and quinces also sliould be preserved before they 
are quite ripe enough for eating. They should be parboiled 
before eating. No fruit should be over-ripe when preserved. 
Damsons and blue plums should be slit lengthwise with a pen 
knife, and set in the sun before preserving, which will render 
it easy to extract the stones. Cherries also should be stoned 
before preserving. A piece of paper dipped in brandy and laid 
iji top the preserves will help to keep them. I would suggest 
to housekeepers that they always put their preserves in glass 
jars with screw tops. By this means they can readily inspect 
it and see if it is keeping well, without the trouble of untying 
the jar and looking inside, as would be necessary in the case of 
stone jars. 

Set the jar of preserves, if they, become dry or candied, in a 
pot of cold water, which allow to come gradually to a boil. If 
the preserves ferment, boil them over with more sugar. 

The great secret of making nice fruit jelly is to boil the syrup 
well before adding the sugar (which should always be loaf or 
cut), and you should allow a pound of sugar to a j)int of the 
juice in acid fruit jellies, though less will answer for sweet 
fruit. By boiling the syrup well before adding the sugar, the 
flavor and color of the fruit are retained. Keep the jelly in 
small, common glasses. 

Sweetmeat Preserves. 

Cut the rind in any shapes fancied (such as flowers, fruits, 
leaves, grapes, fish, etc.), put it in brine strong enough to float 
an egg, cover closely with grape leaves, and set away the jar. 
When ready to make the preserves, soak the rind in fresh 
water, changing it till all taste of salt is removed from the rind. 
Dissolve four tablespoonfuls pulverized alum in one gallon 
water. Lay the rind iu this, covered closely with grape or 
cabbage leaves. Simmei till it becomes a pretty green, then 
soak out the alum by throwing the rind in soft water. 

Pour boiling water on half a pound white ginger, and let it 



WATERMELON OR MUSKMELON MARMALADE. 445 

stand long enougli to soften sufficiently to slice easily in thin 
pieces (retaining the shapes of the ra^es as much as possible). 
Then boil it an hour in half a gallon water, and add one ounce 
mace and two pounds best cut sugar. This makes a thin syrup, 
in which boil the rind gently for half an hour, adding water to 
keep the riud covered with syrup. 

Set the kettle away for four days and then boil again as be- 
fore, adding two pounds sugar and more water, if necessary. 
Repeat the boiling six or seven times, till the syrup is rich and 
thick and sufficient to cover the rind. 

The quantity of seasoning given above is for three gallons 
rind. Allow two pounds sugar to each pound fruit. This 
sweetmeat keeps indefinitely and never ferments. — 3Irs, F, M, C, 

Watekmelon or Muskmelon Marmalade. 

Weigh twelve pounds rind, previousl}'- soaked in brine, and 
the salt extracted by fresh water, parboil, put on with twelve 
pounds sugar made into a thin syrup, and boil to pieces. Add 
the peelings of twelve oranges and twelve lemons, previously 
soaked in water, cut in strips and boiled extrmeley soft, the 
water being changed three times while boiling. Stir con- 
stantly fromthe bottom with a batter-cake turner. Cook very 
thick. Put in wide-mouthed glass jars — ]\£rs. S, T. 

KiPE Muskmelon or Watermelon Preserves. 
During the summer, peel and slice indiffiirent cantaleupes 
(such as you do not care to eat), especially such as are not quite 
ripe. Throw them into brine, together with your thickest wa- 
termelon rinds, peeling off the outside skin. When you have 
enough, weigh them, throw them in fresh water, which change 
daily till the salt is extracted. Boil in a preserving kettle till 
soft enough to pierce with a straw. Make a syrup, allowing 
one pound sugar for each pound fruit. When it boils, put the 
rind in it and simmer steadily till the rind is transparent and 
the syrup thick. When cool, add the juice and grated rind of

strain tlie syrup (which will have become thin), boil it again, 
pour over the rind, and put the preserves in glass jars with

Ripe Muskmelon Pkeserves. 

Peel and slice the melons, soak them twenty-four hours in 
salt water, twenty-four hours in alum water, and twenty-four 
hours in fresh water, changing the latter several times. Then 
make a strong ginger tea, in which boil them slowly till they 
taste of ginger. 

Make a syrup, allowing a pound and a half sugar to each 
pound fruit, and adding mace and sliced ginger (the latter 
must be soaked in boiling water twelve hours before it is wanted). 
Cook the melon in the syrup till clear and tender. You may 
use sliced lemons as a seasoning instead of ginger. — Mrs. JR. L. 

Pineapple Preserves. 

Parboil the pineapples, then peel and cut in thick slices, 
carefully taking out the cores, which, if allowed to remain, will 
cause the preserves to ferment. Put a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit, and let it remain all night to make the syrup. 
Boil then till done, without adding a drop of water to the syrup. 
—Mrs. F. a 

Orange Preserves. 
Peel a thin rind off the oranges and make a hole in each end, 
getting out all the seed. Pour boiling water over them and let 
them stand till next morning. If the water tastes bitter, search 
for seed. Pour boiling water over them every day, as long as 
the bitterness remains. Boil till soft enough to run a straw 
through them. Add a pound and a half sugar to each pound 
fruit. Make a thin syrup of half the sugar, and boil the oranges 
in it a short time. Let them stand in the syrup three days, 
then pour the syruj from the fruit, put the rest of the sugar to

The day before making, peel one dozen oranges (no matter 
how sour and indiflerent). Throw the peel in a bucket of 
water, take out the seed, cut up the pulp fine with a pair of 
old scissors. Then take the peel, cut it in thin strips and throw 
it into fresh water. Pare and slice pippins (or any other nice 
apple). Weigh six pounds of them, stew with a little water till 
perfectly done, and set away. Next day, run this pulp through 
a colander into a preserving kettle. Add six pounds sugar and 
boil slowly, constantly scraping from the bottom. 

Take the orange peel" (which should have been left in soak all 
night), boil till perfectly soft and free from bitterness, changing 
the water three times while boiling. In another preserving 
kettle, simmer this with the orange pulp and two pounds sugar. 
When both are nearly done, turn the oranges into the apples 
and cook them very thick. Cool in a bowl, and then put in a 
glass jar with a screw top. — Mrs. JS. T. 

Sliced Lemon Preserves. 
Take large, firm lemons, not quite ripe, cut in slices one- 
quarter inch thick, and take out the seed. Soak in brine a week. 
Then soak several days in clear water, changing the water twice 
a day. When all the salt and the bitter taste are extracted, 
weigh the lemons and boil till tender enough to pierce with a 
straw. Make a thin syrup, allowing one pound of sugar to 



448 LEMON MAEMALADE PEACH PKESERVES. 

each pound of fruit. Put the lemons in and let them simmer 

slowly a good many hours. Pour into a large bowl and let it 

remain there several days. At the end of that time strain the 

syrup (which will have become thin), put the lemons in it 

again, and boil till they jelly. When cool put in a glass jar 

with a screw top. The same recipe may be used for oranges. — 

Mrs. S. T. 

Lemon Marmalade. 

Every housekeeper should keep a large jar, or other nice 
vessel, filled with brine, in which she may throw lemon peels 
after being deprived of the grated rind and juice, used for 
creams, jellies, etc. These may remain any length of time, to 
suit one's convenience. Before preserving, soak in pure water 
till all the taste of salt is extracted. Boil till soft enough to 
pierce with a straw. Then put in a preserving kettle nine 
pounds cut sugar and one quart water. As soon as it boils, add 
six pounds lemon peel and three pounds nice sliced apples 
(pippins are best). Boil till very thick. — Mrs. /S. T, 

Lemon Preserves 

May be made of lemon peel, prepared exactly by the above 
recipe. Put the peel in a preserving kettle and keep covered, 
while boiling in clear water, till you can run a straw through 
it. Then throw it into a rich syrup (one pound sugar to one 
of lemon peel), and boil a long time. Put in a bowl till the 
next day; then take the syrup (which will be somewhat thin) 
and boil again till very thick. Pour it over the lemon, and when 
cold it will be jellied.— Jfrs. .S'. T. 

Peach Preserves. 

Pare white freestone peaches, not quite ripe. Split in half, 
take out the stones, and throw the peaches in a bucket of water 
to prevent them from turning dark. Make a syrup of white 
sugar, using as many pounds of sugar as you have pounds of 
peaches. When it has boiled thick, put in as many peaches aa

•will cover the bottom of the kettle. Let them boil till nearly 
done ; then take them out, one by one, in a perforated spoon. 
Lay them in dishes and set in the sun. When all the peaches 
have been carried through this process, put back the first dish 
of peaches in the kettle, taking them out when a pretty amber 
color, and so on till all have been boiled twice. Meantime the 
peach-kernels should have been scalded and skinned. Put them 
in the boiling syrup, which must be kept on the fire till very 
thick. Put the peaches when cool in glass jars, and pour the 
syrup over thera. In a few days examine, and if the syrup has 
become tliin, boil again. — Mrs. S. T. 

Peach Preserves. 

Pare, and add to a pound of peaches one and one-quarter 
pounds best sugar. Cook very fast for a few moments, in a 
porcelain kettle. Turn out in a bowl, cover with muslin or 
cambric, set in the sun, stirring every day till they seem quite 
transparent. They retain their flavor much better this way than 
when cooked on the fire. Put in jars, cover with paper saturated 
with brandy, and tie up tightly to exclude the air. — Mrs. P. TK 

Peach Marmalade. 

Boil twelve pounds soft peaches in a little water. When re- 
duced to a pulp, run through a colander and boil again till very 
thick, constantly scraping from the bottom. Add half a pound 
sugar to one poimd fruit. Cool in a bowl, and then put in glass 
jars with screw tops. Pear marmalade may be made by the 
same recipe, and also apple marmalade, except that you flavor 
the last with lemon juice and rind. — Mrs. S. T. 

Brandy Peaches. 

For twelve pounds large freestone Heath peaches, not quite 

ripe and delicately pared, make a syrup of four pounds sugar. 

Scald a few peaches at a time in the syrup, till all have gone 

through this process. Place on dishes to cool. Then put in 



450 BRANDY PEACHES CEAB APPLE PEESEEVES. 

glass jars and add enougli good whiskey or brandy to the syrup 
to caver the peaches. Any spirit will do, if strong enough. 
Add a few blanched peach-kernels. In a few days see if more 
liquor or sugar is required. If so, drain off the syrup, add what 
is needed, and pour again over the fruit. It is a mistake to put 
too much sugar. Always use freestone peaches. — 3£rs. S. T. 

JSrandy Peaches. 
Put the peaches (a few at a time) in boiling lye. Let them 
remain five minutes, to loosen the fur. Then take them out and 
wipe perfectly clean and white. Then drop them in cold water. 
Boil them gently in a rich syrup till a straw will pierce them. 
Then put in a jar, and mix equal parts of French brandy with 
the syrup. Carefully exclude the air. — Mrs. G. JST. 

Pear Preserves. 
Scald the fruit, but do not let it remain till it comes to 
pieces. Boil till clear, in a syrup made of as many pounds of 
sugar as you have of fruit. — Mrs. J. J. A. 

Preserved Apples for Yv^inter Use. 
Pare and slice pippins. Put to each pound apples half a 
pound sugar, and to every eight pounds thus sweetened one 
quart water, a few cloves, the thin rind and juice of a lemon. 
Stew till clear, and eat with cream. — Mrs, JB. JT. B. 

Apple Mange. 
Stew and mash well three pounds pippins, then add three 
pounds sugar. Just before they are done, add a few drops 
lemon juice. Put in moulds and it will keep two years. 
Turned out and sliced, it is a nice dish for tea. Quitces are as 
nice as apples, prepared this way. — Mrs. B. J, B. 

Crab Apple Preserves. 
Put the crab apples in a kettle, with some alum, keeping

them scalding hot for an hour. Take them out, skin and ex- 
tract the seed with a small knife, leaving on the stems. Put 
them in cold water awhile, then take them out, wipe them and 
put them in a syrup made of as many pounds sugar as you have 
of fruit. Let them stew gently till they look clear, then take 
them out and let the syrup boil longer. Siberian crabs may be 
preserved in the same way, except that they are not peeled and 
cored. 

Quince Jam. 

Pour boiling water over them and let them remain till the 
skin rubs off easily. Then peel them and cut off the fair slices. 
To each pound put twelve ounces sugar, and let them stew 
together till the syrup is sufficiently thick. 

Quince preserves may be made by the same recipe as that 
used for pears. 

Damson Preserves. 

With a sharp penknife, cut a long slit lengthwise in each dam- 
son. Spread in dishes and set in the sun till the seed comes 
out readily. Then boil till thoroughly done in a thick syrup 
made of as many pounds sugar as there are pounds of damsons. 

Preserve green gage plums and other plums by the same 
recipe. — Miss P. 

Fox Grape Preserves. 

Seed the grapes, then pour scalding water on them and let 
them stand till cold ; then draw oflf the water, put one pound 
sugar to one pound of grapes, and boil gently about twenty min. 
utes. — Mrs. A, D. 

Cherry Preserves. 

Wash, pick and stone the cherries, saving the juice. Allow 
one pound sugar to each pound fruit. Boil the juice and sugar 
to a thick syrup, then put in half the cherries and stew till 
nearly done. Take them out with a perforated spoon and lay 
on dishes. Pat in the other half, let them stew as long as the 
first J then take out and lay in dishes. Meantime boil the syrup

gently. When the cherries are cool, put them again in the syrup 
and boil a short time. Pour in a large bowl and cool, then put 
in glass jars and cover tightly. 

Scarlet short stems and large wax cherries are best for pre- 
serving. — Mrs. S. T. 

Stkawberry Preserves. 

Cap the berries. Put one and a half pounds sugar to each 
pound fruit. Let them stand two or three hours, and then boil 
thirty minutes. 

Strawberry Jam. 

Cap and wash the berries, and put them on to stew with a very 
small quantity of water. Stir constantly. When thoroughly 
done and mashed to a soft pulp, add one pound sugar to each 
pound fruit. The advantage of adding sugar last is that it pre- 
serves the color and flavor of the fruit. Stew till sufficiently 
thick, scraping constantly from the bottom with a batter-cake 
turner. — 3£rs. B. T. 

Baspberry Jam. 

Wash and pick the berries, boil with a little water, mashing 
and scraping from the bottom as they simmer. When reduced 
to a thick pulp, add one-half pound sugar to each pound berries. 
Stew till very thick, scraping constantly from the bottom. Cool 
in a large bowl, then put in a glass jar with screw top. Black- 
berry, Dewberry, and Whortleberry Jam may be made by the 
same recipe. 

Fig Preserves. 
Pick the figs fully ripe the evening before. Cut off about 
half the stem, and let them soak all night in very weak salt and 
water. Drain off the salt water in the morning and cover them 
with fresh. Make a thick syrup, allowing three-quarters pound 
loaf sugar to each pound fruit. When it boils, drop the figs 
carefully in and let them cook till they look clear. When done 
take from the fire and season with extract of lemon or ginger. 



TOMATO PRESERVES — RECIPE FOR PdTTING UP FRUIT. 453 

The figs must not be peeled, as the salt water removes the 
roughness from the skin and keeps the fruit firm and hard. — 
Miss A. S. 

Tomato Preserves (either ripe or green). 

The day before preserving, peel and weigh eight pounds pale 
yellow, pear-shaped or round tomatoes, not quite ripe ; spread 
on dishes alternate layers of tomato and sugar, mixing with the 
latter the grated rind and juice of four lemons. In the morn- 
ing, drain off the juice and sugar and boil to a thick syrup. 
Drop in half the tomatoes and boil till transparent. Take up 
with a perforated spoon and put on dishes to cool. Then carry 
the other half through exactly the same process. Then strain 
the juice, wash the kettle, and put in the juice again. When it 
boils hard, put in again the fii'st boiled tomatoes. Take them 
out when they become amber color, and put in the rest. When 
they are all boiled to an amber color, and cooled on dishes, put 
them in half-gallon glass jars, and add the syrup after it has 
been boiled to a thick jelly. — Mrs. S. T. 

Green Tomato Sweetmeats. 

Slice the tomatoes and soak them a day and night in salt and 
water, then in fresh water for an hour or two, then scald in 
alum water with grape leaves. When taken out of alum water, 
put in cold water to cook. Scald in ginger-tea and again put 
in cold water, while you make the syrup. To each pound toma- 
toes put one and a quarter pounds sugar and a few races of 
white ginger. Cook the tomatoes till clear, the syrup till thick. 
When cool, season the syrup with essence of lemon and pour 
over the tomatoes. — Mrs. C. M. 

Recipe for putting up Fruit. 

For fruit not very acid, weigh one-quarter of a pound white 

sugar to one pound fruit perfectly ripe. After sprinkling the 

fruit with sugar, put it in a preserving kettle and let it just 

como to a boil. Then put it quickly in glass self-sealing cans,

being careful to screw down the tops tightly. — Mrs. Dr. E. 

T.B. 

Candied Fruit. 

Preserve the fruit, then dip it in sugar boiled to a candied 
thickness, and dry it. Grapes and some other fruits may be 
dipped in uncooked. 

Lemon Conserves. 

"Wash and dry ten lemons. Pare the yellow rind off clear of 
the white, and beat it in a mortar with double its weight of 
sugar. Pack closely in a jar and cover with part of the sugar. 
—Mrs. T. 

Orange Conserves. 

Cut the peel in long, thin strips, and stew in water till all 
bitterness is extracted. Drain off this water and stew again in 
a thick syrup, allowing one pound sugar to each pound peel. 
Put away in a cool place for flavoring puddings, pies, etc. 

Peach Conserves. 
Pare the peaches and cut them ft-om the stone in thick slices. 
Make a syrup, allowing three-quarters pound sugar to each 
pound fru^it. Boil the peaches and put them on dishes to dry. 
As they dry, roll them in granulated sugar, and pack in jars or 
boxes. — Mrs. Wl JP. 

Golden Syrup. 

Five pounds white sugar ; one quart water. Let it boil two 
or three minutes, then add two pounds strained honey. It will 
keep for months. — Mrs. D. G. 

Blackberry Jelly. 

Crush one quart blackberries with one pound best loaf sugar. 
Cook it over a gentle fire till thick, then add one gill best brandy.

is dissolved. Then put them in jars, seal them and expose them 
to a hot sun two or three days. — Mrs. E. 

Currant Jelly. 

Pick ripe currants from the stem, and put them in a stone 
jar. Then set the jar in an iron pot and let the fruit boil till 
the juice is extracted. Pour in a flannel bag and let it drip 
through — without squeezing, however, as this makes it cloudy. 

To each pint of juice add one pound good white sugar. Boil 
about twenty minutes and keep it well skimmed. Put in the 
glasses while hot, and sun daily. — Mrs. P. JV. 

Cranberry Jelly. 
Wash and pick the cranberries, put them in the preserving 
kettle with a very small quantity of water, cover closely and 
stew till done. Pour through a jelly bag or coarse towel, with- 
out squeezing, as this will prevent it from being clear. Measure 
and pour the liquid into the preserving kettle. Let it boil up 
and remove the scum, then add the sugar, cut or loaf, one pound 
to a pint. Boil about twenty minutes, or until it jellies. It 
preserves the color of fruit jellies to add the sugar as late as 
possible. — Mrs. jS. T. 

Apple Jelly. 

Take half a peck of pippin apples, wash them clean, slice 
them from the core, put them in a preserving kettle with a 
quart of water. Boil till entirely soft, then strain through a 
flannel bag. To each pint of juice add one pound white sugar 
and the juice of three lemons. Boil till jellied. Do not stir 
while boiling. — Mrs. P. W. 

Apple Jelly. 
Pare and stew sour, juicy apples (Greenings are best), in 
enough water to cover them. Strain as for currant jelly. 



456 APPLE JELLY — OEANGE JELLY. 

Allow a pound of sugar for each pound of juice. Put them

Apple Jelly. 
Take any number of juicy apples, put tliem in a porcelain 
kettle, and boil to rags. Then strain them through a cloth or 
sieve. Put a pound of loaf sugar to each pint of the juice, and 
boil till it jellies. Flavor with the seed beaten in a mortar, 
and put in while the apples are cooking. — Mrs. G. W. 

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Slice the apples, take out the cores and seed, as they make the 
jelly bitter. Put them in a kettle cover with water, and boil 
till quite soft, keeping it well skimmed. Pour the pulp in a 
jelly bag, and let it drip through. To each pint of juice, add 
one pound and a half of sugar. Pour in the glasses while hot. 
Delicious with meats. — 3frs. P. TK 

Quince Jelly. 

Make the same as apple jelly, only do not pare or core the 
fruit, as much of the jelly is contained in those parts. Or, you 
may take the sound parings and cores, stew them and strain 
the liquor twice, and you will have a jelly as nice as that 
made from the fruit. To each pound of juice allow one pound 
of sugar. Boil fifteen minutes. — Mrs. M. J5. M.

Jelly Oranges. 

Dissolve one package gelatine in one cup cold water, after- 
wards adding two cups boiling water to thoroughly dissolve it. 
Add then three cups white sugar, one-quarter teaspoonful cin- 
namon, grated rind of three oranges, juice of twelve fine 
oranges. Strain through a flannel bag into a pitcher, without 
shaking or squeezing. Extract the pulp from the orange, by 
making a hole in one end of it large enough to admit a mus- 
tard spoon. Soak the rind a few hours, and then pour the 
jelly into each orange through the whole at the end. Then set 
aside to congeal. Garnish with orange leaves. Cut each 
orange in two. A very ornamental dish. — Mrs. Mc G. 

Green Grape Jelly. 

Gather Catawba grapes before ripening. Pick them from 
the stem, wash them, and put them in a stone jar. Set the 
jar in a kettle of cold water over a hot fire. When the juice 
comes out of the grapes, take the kettle off and strain the 
grapes. To each pint of juice put one pound of the best loaf 
sugar. Boil twenty minutes in the kettle. Ripe grape jelly 
may be made in the same way. — 3Irs. E. 

Grape Jelly. 
The chief art in making jelly is to boil it continuously, slowly 
and gently. It will not harden well if the boiling stops, even 
for a few moments. To preserve the true color and flavor of 
fruit in jellies or jams, boil well before adding the sugar; in 
this way the water contained in all fruit juices is evaporated. 
Heat the sugar before adding it. In making grape jelly, pick 
the grapes from their stems, wash them, put them over the fire 
in a vessel containing a little water, to keep them from burn- 
ing. Stew a few moments ; mash gently with a silver spoon, 
strain, and to every pint of juice, allow one pound of white 
sugar. After the juice comes to the boiling point, boil twenty

WINE. 

Be sure to get perfectly ripe fruit for making wine, but do 
not gather it immediately after rain, as it is watery then and 
less sweet than usual. 

Be very careful to stop the wine securely as soon as fermen- 
tation ceases, as otherwise it will lose its strength and flavor. 
Watch carefully to see when fermentation ceases. 

Strawberry wine makes a delicious flavoring for syllabub, 
cake, jelly, etc., and so does gooseberry wine. Dewberries 



462 BLACKBEEEY WINE. 

make a prettier and better wine than blackberries, and have all 
the medicinal virtues of the latter. 

The clearest wine is made without straining, by the following 
process ; Take a tub or barrel (a flour-barrel for instance), and 
make a little pen of sticks of wood at the bottom. On top of 
this pen lay an armful of clean straw. Bore a hole in the 
side of the tub or barrel as near the bottom as possible, and set 
it on a stool or box so as to admit of setting a vessel underneath 
it. After mashing the berries intended for wine, put them on top 
the straw, and let the juice drain through it and run through the 
hole at the side of the tub or barrel into the vessel set beneath 
to catch it. Be careful to have this vessel large enough to 
avoid its being overrun. Any open stone vessel not used be- 
fore for pickle will answer, or a bucket or other wooden vessel 
may be used. Let the berries remain on the straw and drain 
from evening till the next morning. Some persons make a 
slight variation on the process above described, by pouring hot 
water over the berries after putting them on the straw. After 
the draining is over, an inferior sort of wine may be made by 
squeezing the berries. 

The following process will make wine perfectly clear : To a 
half-gallon of wine put two wine-glasses of sweet milk. Stir 
it into the wine and pour it all in a transparent half-gallon bottle. 
Stop it and set it by for twenty- four Lours, at the end of which 
time the wine will be beautifully clear, the sediment settling 
with the milk at the bottom. Pour off the wine carefully into 
another bottle, not allowing any of the sediment or milk to get 
into the fresh bottle. The same directions apply to vinegar. 

Blackbeery Wine. 
Fill large stone jars with ripe black or dewberries. Cover 
them with water, mash them, and let them stand several hours, 
or, if freshly gathered, let them stand all night. Then strain

gallon of juice. Let the wine stand a few days in the jars,

the berries as fine as possible and pour over them a water-bucket 
of clear s])ring water. Cover it and let it stand twenty-four 
hours to ferment. Next day strain through a cloth, and to every 
three quarts juice add two quarts clear cold water and five 
pounds common brown sugar. Pour in a demijohn or runlet, 
reserving some to fill the vessel as fermentation goes on. After 
six or eight days, put to every ten gallons one-half box gelatine. 
After two weeks, cover the bung-liole with a * \A.qq,q of muslin. 
Two or three weeks later, cork tightly and then leave undisturb- 
ed for six months. After that time, bottle and seal. Superior 
currant wine may be made by this recipe. — Mrs. F. 

J^lackherry Wine. 
Fill a large stone jar with the ripe fruit and cover it with 
water. Tie a cloth over the jar and let them stand three or 
four days to ferment; then mash and press them through a 
cloth. To every gallon of juice add three pounds of brown 
sugar. Return the mixture to the jar and cover closely. Skim 
it every morning for more than a ^Yeek, until it clears from the 
second fermentation. When clear, pour it carefully from the 
sediment into a demijohn. Cork tightly, set in a cool placo^

Gkape Wine. 
Take any convenient quantity of perfectly ripe grapes. Mash 
them so as to break all the skins, and put them in a tub or 
other clean vessel, and let them remain twenty-four hours ; with 
a cider-press or other convenient apparatus, express all the juice, 
and to each gallon of juice thus obtained add from two to two 
and a half pounds of white sugar (if the grapes are sweet, two 
pounds will be enough), put the juice and sugar in a keg or 
barrel, and cover the bung-hole with a piece of muslin, so the 
gas can escape and dust and insects cannot get in ; let it remain 
perfectly quiet until cold weather, then buug up tiglitly. This 
wiue will need no clarifying ; if allowed to rest perfectly still 
it can be drawn ofi" perfectly clear. — Mr, IV. A. S. 

Grape Wine. * 

Pick the grapes from the bunch, mash thoroughly, and let 
them stand twenty-four hours. Then strain and add three 
pounds of sugar to every gallon of juice. Leave in a cask six 
months, and then bottle, putting three raisins in each bottle. — 
Mrs. B. L.

476 THE SICK-EOOM — ^DIET AND REMEDIES FOK THE SICZ. 



THE SICK-ROOM— DIET AND REMEDIES EOR 

THE SICK. 

First of all, let me say that after a reliable pliysician has been 
called ill, his directions should be strictly followed, and his in- 
structions should be the law in the sick-room. Have every- 
thing in readiness for his admission immediately after his arrival, 
as his time is valuable and it occasions him both annoj'^ance and 
loss of time to be kept waiting outside of the sick-room, after 
reaching the house of the patient. 

Pure air is of vital importance in the sick-room. Many 
persons exclude fresh air for fear of dampness, but even damp 
air is better than impure. Even in cold weather, there should 
be a free circulation of air. If there are no ventilators, let the 
air circulate from the tops of the windows, rather than admit 
it by opening the door, which is apt to produce a draft. Mean- 
time keep up a good fire ; if practicable, let it be a wood fire, 
but if this be not attainable, have an open grate, with a coal 
fire. The sight of a bright blaze is calculated to cheer the 
patient, while the sight of a dark, close stove is depressing. By 
no means allow a sick person to be in a room warmed by a flue 
or register. 

The old idea of darkening the sick-room is exploded. It 
should be darkened only when the patient wishes to sleep. If 
the eyes are weak, admit the sunshine from a quarter where it 
will not fall upon them. The modern science of physics has 
come to recognize sunshine as one of the most powerful of 
remedial agencies, and cases are not rare in which invalids have 
been restored to health by using sun-baths, and otherwise freely 
enjoying the sunshine. 

It is best to have no odors in the sick-room unless it be bay 
rum, German cologne, or something else especially fancied by 
the sick person. Where there is any unpleasant exhalation, 
it is far better to let it escape by properly ventilating the room, 



THE SICK'KOOM — DIET AND REMEDIES FOR THE SICK. 477 

than to try to overcome it by the aid of perfumery. In fevers, 
•where there are ofiensive exhalations from the body, sponging 
with tepid water will help to remove the odor, and will also 
prove soothing to the patient. In winter, expose but a small 
portion of the body at a time, in sponging. Then rub gently 
with the hand or a coarse towel, and there will be no danger of 
the patient's taking cold, even in winter. 

Be careful to keep warm, soft flannels on the sick person in 
winter. In summer, do not keep a pile of bedclothes on the 
patient, even though chilly. It is better to keep up the circu- 
lation by other means, such as rubbing or stimulants. Scrupu- 
lous neatness should be observed about the bed-linen (as well 
as the other appointments of the sick-room). Never use bed- 
quilts or comforts ; they are not only heavy, but retain the 
exhalations from the body. Use soft, fleecy blankets instead. 

The nurse should watch her opportunity of having the bed- 
clothes taken into the fresh air and shaken, and the bed made 
up, when the patient has been lifted up and set in an easy-chair 
near the fire. The arranijements about the bed should be 
quickly made, so that the patient may be able to lie down 
again as soon as fatigued. Let such sweeping and dusting as 
are necessary be also done with dispatch, using a dust-pan to 
receive the dust from the carpet. Avoid clouds of dust from 
the carpet, and of ashes from the fireplace. 

The nurse has a very important part to play, as physicians 
say that nursing is of equal importance as medical attendance. 
The nurse should be careful not to wear a dress that rustles, 
nor shoes that creak, and if the patient has any fancy, or any 
aversion connected with colors, she should regard it in her 
dress. Indeed, the patient should be indulged in every fancy 
that is not hurtful. 

The nurse should be prompt in every arrangement. Where 
blisters or poultices are to be used, she should not wait till the 
last moment to prepare them, but should do so before uncover- 
ing the patient to apply them, or even broaching the subject. 



4:78 THE SICK-EOOM DIET AND REMEDIES FOE THE SICIC. 

If anything painful or distasteful lias to be undergone by the 
patient, it should nob be discussed beforehand with or before, 
the patient; but when all is in readiness, with cheerful and 
soothing words, let it be done. 

The patient should never be kept waiting for food, medicine, 
bath, or any other requisite. Every arrangement should be 
made beforehand to supply his or her needs in good time. 
Crushed ice and other needful things should be kept always at 
hand, so the patient may have them at any moment without 
delay. Especially on the approach of night, try to provide 
everything needed during the night, such as ice, mustard, hot 
water, kindling wood, a large piece of soapstone for the feet, 
as this is more cleanly and retains heat better than other 
things used for the purpose. Other things, such as the nature 
of the sickness may call for, should be thoiight of and pro- 
vided before nightfall. 

As the sick are very fastidious, all food for them must be 
prepared in the most delicate manner. Do not bring the 
same article of food several times consecutively, but vary it 
from time to time. Do not let a sick person have any article 
of food forbidden by a physician, as there are many reasons 
known to them only, why dishes fancied by the sick should be 
injurious. 

Avoid whispering, as this excites nervousness and appre- 
hension on the part of the sick. Do not ask in a mournful tone 
of voice how the patient is. Indeed, it is best to ask the sick as 
few questions as possible. It is far better to watch their symp- 
toms for yourself than to question them. Examine for j^ourself if 
their feet are warm, and endeavor to discover their condition 
and their wants, as far as possible, without questions. 

In a case of illness, many well-meaning persons crowd to see 
the patient ; do not admit them into the sick-room, as it is both 
exciting and fatiguing to an ill person to see company, and, 
when in a critical condition, the balance might be disastrously 
turned by the injudicious admission of visitors. Both mind 



ARROWEOOT. 479 

and body must be kept quiet to give the patient a chance for 
recovery. When well enough to listen to conversation, the 
patient should hear none but what is cheerful and entertain- 
ing, never any of an argumentative or otherwise unpleasant 
nature. 

Do not allow the patient to read, as it is too great a tax on 
the sight and brain before convalescence. Suitable books, in 
large print, are a great resource to the patient when arrived at 
this stage, but should be read only in moderation. 

Dri^•ing out is a delightful recreation for convalescents, and 
they should be indulged in it as soon as the physician pronoun- 
ces it safe. In winter, they should be carried driving about 
noon, so as to enjoy the sunshine at its warmest. In summer, 
the cool of the morning or evening is the best time to drive them 
out ; but if the latter time be chosen, be careful to return imme- 
diately after sundown. Make arrangements for the patient 
on returning to find the room thoroughly cleaned, aired, and 
adorned with fresh flowers (always so cheering in a sick-room), 
and let the bed be nicely made up and turned down. It is well 
to have some little refreshment awaiting after the drive — a little 
cream or milk toddy, a cup of tea or coffee, or, if the weather be 
hot, some cooling draught perhaps would be moi-e acceptable. 
It is well to keep the convalescent cheered, by projecting each 
day some new and pleasant little plan for the morrow. 

Arrowroot. 
Break an egg. Separate the yolk and white. Whip each to 
a stifl" froth. Add a tablespoonful of arrowroot and a little 
water to the yolk. Rub till smooth and free from lumps. Pour

Beef Essence. 

Cut one pound beef in small bits, sprinkle with a very little 
salt, tie up in a close stone jar, and set in boiling water. Boil 
it hard an hour or more, then strain it. Chicken may be pre- 
pared the same way. Nice for the sick. — 3frs. Col. Wl 

Beef-Tea. 
Take half a pound fresh beef for every pint of beef-tea 
required. Carefully remove all fat, sinew, veins, and bone from 
the beef. Cut it in pieces under an inch square and let it soak 
twelve hours in one-third of the water required to be made into 
tea. Then take it out and let it simmer three hours in the re- 
maining two- thirds of the water, the quantity lost by evapora- 
tion being replaced from time to time. The boiling liquor is 
then to be poured on the cold liquor in which the meat was 
soaked. The solid meat is to be dried, pounded in a mortar, 
and minced so as to cut up all strings in it, and mixed with the 
liquid. When the beef-tea is made daily, it is convenient to 
use one day's boiled meat for the next day's tea, as thus it has 
time to dry and is more easily pounded. Avoid having it 
sticky and too much jellied, when cold.

densed, the following is an excellent mode for concentrating, in 
a small compass, all the nutritive properties of a chicken. 

After picking the chicken, sprinkle a little salt over it and 
cut it in pieces, as if for frying. Put the pieces in a small 
glass jar (or wide-mouthed bottle), stop it tightly, and put it in 
a pot of cold water, gradually heating the latter till it boils. 
Let the jar of chicken remain in the water till the juices are 
well extracted, then pour them off for the patient. — Mrs. M, 
G. G, 

Chicken Jelly. 

Take a large chicken, cut the flesh from its bones, break the 
bones, soak an hour in weak salt and water to extract the blood. 
Put on in a stewpan with three pints of cold water. Simmer 
till reduced to less than half its original quantity. Sprinkle 
a little salt on it, and strain in a bowl. Keep on ice. — Mrs,

ins for hours. Season the iuice thus extracted with a little 
salt, stir in a teaspoonful of fresh milk, and give to the patient. 

—Mrs. T, 

Panada. 

Lay six nice crackers in a bowl. Sprinkle over them pow- 
dered sugar and a pinch of salt, adding a very small piece of fresh 
butter. Pour boiling water over the crackers, and let them 
remain near the fire half an hour. Then add a teaspoonful of 
good French brandy, or a tablespoonful of Madeira wine, and a 
little grated nutmeg. — Mrs. T.

Lime-Water. 
This is easily prepared, and a bottle should always be kept 
ready for use. It is an antidote to many poisons and a valua- 
ble remedy in a sick-room. Put some pieces of unslacked lime 
in a bottle, fill up with cold water, keep it corked and in a cool, 
dark place. It does not matter about the quantity of lime, as 
the water will not dissolve more than a certain quantity. It is 
ready for use in a few minutes, and the clear lime-water can be 
poured off as needed. When all the water is used, fill up again, 
which may be done several times before it is necessary to use 
fresh lime, — Mrs. T. 

Tarrant's Effervescent Seltzer Aperient 
Is an invaluable remedy for sick headache, nausea, constipation, 
and many of the attendant evils of dyspepsia. Directions 
accompany each bottle. Colic and other violent pains of the 
stomach are sometimes instantly relieved by adding to the dose 
of Seltzer Aperient a teaspoonful of Brown's Jamaica Ginger. 

Brown's Jamaica Ginger 
Is not only an invaluable remedy, but a refreshing and delight- 
ful drink may be made from it in summer, when iced lemonade 
would be unsafe and iced juleps, etc., would be too heating for 
one suffering from over-fatigue. Fill a goblet with crushed ice, 
add two tea-poonfuls of powdered sugar and one of Jamaica gin- 
ger. Fill up with water, stir and drink. — Mrs. 8. T.

MUSTARD LEAVES OR PLASTERS FOR SORE-THROAT. 485 

valuable are its medicinal properties. When a large plaster is 
wa,nted, put into a plate or bowl two tablespoonfuls ground 
mustard. Wet it with cold water and stir with a spoon or knife 
till a smooth paste. Lay on an inverted tea-board a piece of 
newspaper twice the size of the plaster wanted. On one-half 
spread evenly and thinly the mustard. Fold over the other half 
and fold over the edges as if to hem a piece of cloth, to prevent 
the mustard from getting on the skin or clothing. In winter, 
warm slightly before applying. Keep it on an adult fifteen 
minutes ; on a child, half that time. In this way, painful blis- 
ters will always be avoided. If the pain is in the chest or stom- 
ach, place the same plaster on the back just opposite, and let 
it remain on twenty minutes the second time. Colman's mus- 
tard is considered the best by many persons. 

Mustard Leaves or Plasters. 
It is well in travelling to carry a package of these plasters, in 
case of sudden sickness. It is important also to keep them at 
home, as sometimes they are needed suddenly in the night, and 
even one moment gained is important in great emergencies. 
Those manufactured by Seabury & Johnson, N. Y., are con- 
sidered excellent and superior to the foreign article.

and most easily procured dressings. If the scald or burn is 
trifling, this is all that is needed. Lather of soap from the shav-

minister frequently aromatic spirits of ammonia or a little 
brandy and water till the patient rallies.

HOUSE-CLEANING. 

Do not clean but one room at a time, as it is a bad plan to 
have the whole house in confusion at once. It is best to com- 
mence with the attic. 

Before beginning on your spring cleaning, remove the cur- 
tains, all the movable furniture, and the carpets. With a 
broom and dust-pan remove all dust from the floor. Then 
with a wall-brush thoroughly sweep and dust the ceiling and 
side-walls, window and door frames, pictures and chandeliers. 
Then go over the floor again, removing the dust that has fallen 
from the ceiling and walls. Then proceed to wash all the paint 
in the room. If it be white paint, use whiting or such other 
preparations as are recommended for the purpose in the subse- 



HOTJSE-CLEA]SnNG. 497 

quent pages. If it be varnished, or in imitation of oak or wal- 
nut, wipe with a cloth, clipped in milk-warm water. If the 
wood work in the room be of unvarnished walnut or oak, wipe 
it off first, and thfen oil it, rubbing in the oil well. 

Then with a soft flannel i-ag and a cake of sapolio clean every 
piece of marble in the room. Next wipe the mirrors carefully 
with a flannel rag, wrung out of warm water and dipped in a 
little whiting, or you may rub a little silver soap on the rag. 
The gilding must be merely dusted, as the least dampness or a 
drop of water will injure it. 

The windows (sash and all) must then be washed in soap 
and water, with a common brush such as is used for washing 
paint. A little soda dissolved in the water will improve tho 
appearance of the windows. It is unnecessary to use such a 
quantity of soap and water as to splash everything around. 
After being washed, the windows should be polished with news- 
papers. Except in a general house- cleaning, windows may be 
cleaned by the directions given above for mirrors. 

The metal about the door-knobs, tongs, etc., may be cleaned 
by electro- silicon, and the grates may be varnished with the 
black varnish kept for the purpose by dealers in grates, stoves, 
etc. Every chair and article of furniture should be carefully 
cleaned before being brought back into the room, and linen 
covers should be put on the chairs. If you are going to put 
down matting, do so before bringing back the first article of 
furniture. Some housekeepers, however, allow their matting 
to remain during the winter under their carpets. Spots on 
matting may be removed by being scoured with a cloth, dipped 
first in hot water and then in salt. This, however, will cause 
wet spots to appear on it in damp weather. After the spots 
are removed, scrub the matting with dry corn-meal and a coarse 
cloth. Sweep it over several times, till all the meal is removed. 

For persons who do not use matting in summer, a recipe is 
given later for beautifully coloring the floor with boiled linseed 
oil and burnt sienna. Where different woods are used alter- 



498 WHITEWASH FOR OUTDOOE USE. 

nately in the floor, this oil answers better than revarnishing the 
floor every spring. 

As soon as the carpets are taken up, have them nicely 
shaken, swept, and brushed on both sides. Every spot should 
be carefully washed and wiped dry. The carpets should then 
be rolled up smoothly, with tobacco sprinkled between the 
folds, sewed up in coarse linen cloths, and put away till autumn. 
A cedar closet is an excellent place to keep carpets as well as 
other woollens. If you have no cedar closet, however, a cedar 
chest will serve to protect your woollen clothes against moths, 
and it is better to preserve them in this way than to sprinkle 
them with tobacco, which imparts an unpleasant scent to them. 

Whitewash for Outdoor Use. 

Take good quick-lime in lumps. Slack it with hot water, and 
while slacking add to what will make a pailful one pound 
tallow or other grease, free from dirt. It may be rancid, smoked, 
or otherwise unfit for kitchen use. 

When the violent slacking is over, stir thoroughly. All the 
water should be added before the slacking ceases, and the mix- 
ing together should be thorough. Do not dilute with cold 
water. If well made, it will be very smooth and but little 
affected by rain. — Mrs. E. 

Indoor Whitewashing. 
We have recently seen recommended in a journal a fine 
and brilliant whitewash preparation of chalk, called " Paris 
White," and said to be admirable for whitewashing walls. It sells 
in paint stores at three cents per pound, retail. For every sixteen 
pounds Paris White, get half a pound white transparent glue. 
Cover the glue with cold water at night, and in the morning 
heat it, without scorching, till dissolved. Stir in the Paris 
White with hot water to give it a milky consistency. Then add 
and mix well the glue. Apply with a common lime whitewash 
brush. A single coating will do, except on very dingy walls. 
Almost as brilliant as " Zinc White."— iHfrs. S, T. 



TO OIL FLOORS TO WASH CARPETS. 499 

To Oil Floors. 

To one gallon boiled linseed oil add half a pound burnt 
sienna. The druggist who sells these articles will mix them. 
If economy is necessary, instead of employing a painter to put 
it on, dip a large woollen rag into the mixture, and with this 
wipe over the floor. — Mrs, S. T, 

To Dye Floors a Pretty Color. 

Make a strong decoction of the inside bark of red oak. Set 
it a dark color with coj)peras. 

Have the floors well swept and cleaned of spots. Then with 
a cloth rub the dye in well, taking care to wipe up and down 
the floor, so as to prevent streaking. 

Let it dry, then wipe over with weak lye, and as soon as 
this dries ofi", rub with a waxed brush. — Mrs. Dr. P. G, 

To Clean Paint. 
Wring out a clean flannel, take up as much powdered

twelve hours. [That is to say, dilute the balsam with the 
alcohol.] Mix the oil with the turpentine in a separate vessel 
and add the alcohol, and last the ether. — G. G. Wl 

To Clean Silver. 

There is nothing better for this purpose than Colgate's Silver 
Soap, and Robinson's Indexical Silver Soap, made in Boston. 
After the silver has been cleaned, according to the directions 
accompanying each package of the aforementioned kinds of 
soap, wash it in a pan of hot water in which a tablespoonful of 
ammonia has been poured. — Mrs, jS. T. 

To Glean Silver.

tions for use. It may be procured of any druggist. If not 
convenient to get it, use powdered brick-dust. — Mrs, 8. T, 

For the Kitchen. 

Sapolio, manufactured by Enoch Morgan & Sons, should be 
in every kitchen. It is invaluable for cleaning tins, iron-ware, 
knobs, and is so neat a preparation that it does not blacken the 
hanis.

powdered charcoal, moistened with spirits of wine. Rub off 
quickly, wash in hot water, and renew as may be necessary. — 
Mrs. K. 

To Glean Knives, Tins, etc. 

Crystal Kitchen Soap, manufactured by Eastman & Brooke, 
Philadelphia, is excellent for this purpose, being so neat a 
compound that the knives and coffee-pot, as well as the tins 
used in the preparation of breakfast, may be quickly cleaned at 
the table while the tea-china is being washed. 

When not convenient to obtain the Crystal Kitchen Soap, 
knives may be cleaned with ashes either of coal or wood. — Mrs. 
S. T. 

To Whiten the Ivory on the Handles op Knives. 
The ivory handles of knives sometimes become yellow from 
being allowed to remain in dish-water. Rub them with sand-

whiting and litharge. Stir well and use at once. It may be 
washed or scraped off, if desired. — Dr. E. A. G. 

Cement for Kubber and Glass. 
Pulverized gum shellac in ten times its weight of strong 
spirits hartshorn. — Dr. JE. A. C. 

To Destroy Bedbugs. 
Dissolve one ounce corrosive sublimate in one pint strong 
spirits. Put it on the bedsteads with a feather, and it will de- 
stroy the bugs and their eggs also. — Mrs. Dr. P. G. 

Bedbug Poison. 
Alcohol, two and a half pints ; camphor, one ounce ; spirits tur- 
pentine, one ounce ; corrosive sublimate, half an ounce. Mix and 
dissolve. If the scent is not objectionable, two ounces com- 
mercial carbolic acid will greatly improve the above. — Dr. E. 
A. G. 

To Destroy Bugs, Ants, etc. 

Dissolve two pounds alum in three quarts boiling water. 
Apply boiling hot with a brush. Add alum to whitewash for 
store-rooms, pantries, and closets. It is well to pound alum fine 
and sprinkle it about beds infested with bugs. — Mrs. S. T. 

Remedy for Bed Ants. 

Kerosene oil is a sure remedy for red ants. Place small 
blocks under a sugar barrel, so as not to let the oil touch the 
barrel.— iKfrs. J. W.

room.T — Mrs. S. D. 

For the stings of insects, wasps, hornets, bees, etc. Apply to 
the place soda, hartshorn, or arnica. 

Kats. 
Mix a little powdered potash with meal and throw it into the 
rat-holes and it will not fail to drive the rats away. If a mouse 
enters into any part of your dwelling, saturate a rag with 
cayenne in solution and stuff it into his hole. — Mrs. S. D. 

Concentrated Lye Soap. 

All fat and grease from the kitchen should be carefully saved, 
and should be made into soap before accumulating and becoming 
offensive. 

Boil for six hours ten gallons of lye made of green wood 
ashes. Then add eight or ten pounds of grease, and continue to 
boil it. If thick or ropy, add more lye till the grease is 
absorbed. This is ascertained by dropping a spoonful in a glass 
of water, and if grease remains it will show on the water. 

If hard soap is desired, put one quart of salt in half-gallon of 
hot water. Stir till dissolved and pour into the boiling soap. 
Boil twenty minutes, stirring continually. Bemove from the 
fire, and when cold cut in cakes and dry. A box of concen- 
trated lye may be used instead of salt, as it will obviate the 
necessity of using more dripped lye to consume the grease. — 
Mrs. P. W. 

A Washing Mixture. 

Mix and boil twenty minutes one gallon soft soap ; half a 
gallon of weak boiled lye ; four ounces sal soda ; half a gill of 
spirits turpentine. Soak the clothes overnight in milk-warm 
water. In the morning, rinse and wring them. To every gal-

506 TO RESTORE THE PILE OF VELVET. 

To Restore the Pile of Yelvet. 
Heat a large flat-iron, place it in a pan, and lay on it a wet 
cloth. The steam will rise rapidly. Hold the right side of the 
velvet over it. If this does not restore the pile, wet it 
on the wrong side. Have a smooth flat-iron very hot. Set 
it on the edge of the table, upright. If it is a narrow piece 
of velvet, it may be easily ironed by passing the wet side against 
the iron. If a large piece, have some one to hold the botton 
of the iron upwards while the wet side of the velvet is passed 
over it.— Mrs. JS. T. 

To Hestore old Black Silk. 
Pour one pint boiling water on two tablespoonfuls gum arable. 
When a little cooled, add one teaspoonful spirits turpentine and 
the same of spirits ammonia. With a large sponge wipe the 
silk on both sides with this mixture. Then lay the silk on an 
ironing-table, place over it a thin piece of colored rice cambric, 
and iron it very hard with a hot iron. This makes old silk 
look like new. — Mrs. S. T. 

To Freshen old Black Silk. 
Boil one ounce crushed soap bark in one quart water till re- 
duced to one pint. Strain it ; sponge the material with the 
liquid, and while wet iron on the wrong side. Good for black 
woollens also.— ilfrs. M. E. L. W. 

To Renew Black Crape Veils. 
Wring two large towels out of water. Then put the veil 
(folded across the middle, lengthways) on the lower towel ; 
sjpread the other on top and roll the veil, when between, in a 
small tight roll. Let it stand an hour, or till it is damp through. 
Take it out and air it a little before it dries. Fold it then in 
smooth squares, put it in a large book, such as an atlas, put 
heavy weights on it, and let it; stand an hour or two. — Mrs,

TO SET COLORS FOR REMOVING FRUIT OR INK STAINS. 507 

To Set Colors. 

Wasli in strong salt or alum water and rinse in water in 
whicli Irish potatoes have been sliced and boiled, to stiffen. 

A strong tea of hay or fodder preserves the color of brown 
linen. One spoonful gall to a gallon of water will set the colors 
of almost any goods. A teaspoonful sugar of lead in a gallon 
cold water (some say a tablespoonful in a quart soft water) 
will set colors. Let the material soak in it an hour. 

A teacup of lye in a pail of water will improve black calicoes. 

To Restore Colors that have been taken out. 
Rub the spots with hartshorn and place in the sun till dry. 

To Keep Blue Calicoes Bright and Fresh. 
The first time they are washed, put them in water with a 
cupful spirits of turpentine to each pail of water. This will 
set the color, and they will always look well. 

Mildew. 
Moisten the mildewed spot with clear water, then rub over it 
a thick coating of castile soap. Scrape chalk with the soaj), 
mixing and rubbing with the end of the finger. Then wash it 
off. Sometimes one coating suffices, but generally several are re- 
quired. 

Labaraque Solution 

Will remove mildew, ink, or almost any fruit stain from cloth. 
The solution should be washed oflf soon after applying, as it may 
injure the cloth — Dr. E. A. C. 

To Prevent Fruit Stains from being Permanent. 
Wet the stained spot with whiskey before sending it to wash, 
and there will be no sign of it when the article comes in.

MISCELLANEOUS EECIPES. 

Ammonia. 

No housekeeper should be without a bottle of spirits of am- 
monia, for, besides its medical value, it is highly useful for 
household purposes. It is nearly as useful as soap, and its 
cheapness brings it in the reach of all. Put a teaspoonful 
ammonia in a quart of warm soapsuds, dip in a flannel cloth, 
wipe off the dust and fly-specks, and see how much scrubbing it 
will save you. 

For washing windows and mirrors, it is very desirable. A 
few drops on a piece of paper will take off every spot or finger- 
mark on the glass. 

It cleanses and brightens silver wonderfully. Dip your 
forks, spoons, etc., in a pint of suds, mixed with a teaspoonful 
spirits ammonia. Then rub with a brush and polish with 
chamois skin. 

It will take grease spots from every fabric. Put on tjie 
ammonia nearly clear. Lay blotting-paper on the place, and 
pa-ess a hot flat-iron on it a few moments. A few drops of it 
will clean and whiten laces, also musjins. 

It is highly useful and refreshing at the toilet-table. A few 
drops in the bath will remove all offensive perspiration and 
glossiness (if the skin is oily). Nothing is better for cleansing 
the hair from dust and dandruff. A teaspoonful in a pint of 
water will cleanse the dirtiest brushes. Shake the brushes 
through the water, and when they look white, rinse them in 
water and put them in the sunshine or a warm place to dry. 

For medicinal purposes ammonia is almost unrivalled 



BOKAX — BLACK INK. 509 

Inhaling it will often cure headache and catarrhal cold. Ten 
drops aromatic spirits of ammonia in a wine-glass of water is 
excellent for heartburn or dyspepsia. The ordinary spirits of 
ammonia may be used also for the purpose, but it is not so 
palatable. 

Ammonia is also good for vegetation. If you desire roses, 
fuschias, geraniums, etc., to become more flourishing, add five 
or six drops ammonia to every pint of lukewarm water you give 
them. Do not repeat this more than once in five or six days, 
lest you should stimulate them too highly. 

Be sure to keep a large bottle of ammonia in the bouse, and 
use a glass stopper for it, as it is very evanescent and is injuri- 
ous to corks. 

[The above remarks on the usefulness of ammonia were fur- 
nished and endorsed by Mrs. A. D., of Virginia.] 

Borax. 

It is very desirable to keep borax in the house. Its effect ia 
to soften the hardest water, and it is excellent for cleansing 
the hair. Some washerwomen use borax for a washing powder, 
instead of soda, in the proportion of a handful of borax powder 
to ten gallons boiling water, and they save in soap nearly half, 
whilst the borax, being a neutral salt, does not injure the tex- 
ture of the linen. — Mrs. S. T. 

Red Ink.
