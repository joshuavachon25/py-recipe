begins. If only the poor things were properly boiled 
even, at any rate if monotonous their flavour and 
crispness would be discernible. But in nine cases out of 
ten they are over-steeped, over-boiled, and lastly im- 
properly and insufficiently drained, with the results 
only too unpleasantly familiar to most of us. In cooking 
vegetables of all kinds certain points demand attention 
(which too frequently they do not receive), and the first 
of these is cleanliness. All root vegetables, such as 
potatoes, carrots, etc., require to be well scrubbed and 
then thoroughly rinsed in fresh clean water, before 
being peeled, or otherwise prepared for the pot. All 
vegetables which may contain insects, such as cauli- 
flowers, cabbages, etc., should be thoroughly soaked 
in well salted water, and then well rinsed. Seakale, 
salsify, and celery need special attention in washing 
to get rid of sand and gravel between the stalks, in 
consequence of the way they are earthed up. When 
thoroughly cleansed by washing, etc., remove all 
withered and discoloured leaves, and any trace of 
decay or discolouration. 

Potatoes unless new (when they only require to be 
well scrubbed with a coarse cloth) should be peeled 
very thinly. Turnips, on the contrary, should be 
thickly peeled, as their rind is hard and wooden. 
Carrots, unless very old, merely require scraping; 
the same rule applies to salsify, whilst scorzanera, like 
beetroot, should not be peeled till cooked. All root 
vegetables peeled or scraped before cooking should be 
thrown into cold water till wanted, and in the case of 
white vegetables, such as artichokes, celery, cardoons, 
salsify, etc., this cold water should be noticeably salted 



TEGETABLBS. 3 

and aeiduLited with lemoa juice or Tinegar to pnaaerre 
the colour. Unless ;^)eciany directed to the contrary^ 
put all Tegetables on in salted boiling water ; boil root 
vegetaUes in a eoTered pan, and green T^etaUes of 
aU kinds, whether foliage, stalks, seeds, or pods> in 
an uncoTered pan. Many cooks adriae the addition 
of a little soda to the boiling water, whilst others 
actually put in a copper penny to ensure the Tivid 
colour of all green vegetables, but this is neither whole- 
some, nor necessary. If young vegetables are chosen 
(and even on economic grounds no other should l>e 
used), and if an untinned, uncovered pan (from which 
the steam can easily escape) be chosen, and plenty 
of boiling water be allowed, there will be no difficulty 
about the colour. To salt the water one or two full 
tablespoonfuls or a ^oz. to loz. of salt to ouch gallon of 
water, is the right allowance, to which may be added, 
for green vegetables, one-third this amount of sugar, 
to enhance the flavour. Peas especially are improv*id 
by this addition. The more water used in boiliii(^ 
cabbages, greens, etc., the less offensive will be thft tnUfiir 
given out by them. A piece of hretul tied up in t$, 
muslin bag and boiled with the cabbag/i is m'ul Ui Snt 
a remedy against the smell, but thiji cannz/t tM*. M\^\ 
on. After about fifteen minuU^s UnWuii, this ryu^i 
should be removed and burnt at niWM. (J/ili^bs i\i*^

sink pipe, no subsequent rinsing will remove the smell 
this, however, is a mistake, as, if poured down the sink 
directly it is strained off the cabbage, whilst still 
boiling hot, it will cause no inconvenience ; though to 
make doubly sure a jugful of hot water may be poured 
after it. All vegetables that may have a bitter flavour, 
such as turnip-tops, greens, etc., should be either 
blanched {i.e. put on in cold water which is brought 
thoroughly to the boil, then poured off, the vegetables 
being at once re-covered with absolutely boiling water), 
or when half-boiled the water may be poured off and 
replaced in the same way. This methed of cooking 
applies most especially to such things as turnip-tops, 
endive, dandelion, or cabbage, which are occasionally 
most unpleasantly acrid. 

But, if the bull may be forgiven, boiled vegetables 
are best when not boiled at all, but simply steamed. 
It is easy enough to do this, especially if the very useful 
little ** Rapid '* steamer, procurable for a few pence 
at most good ironmongers, be amongst the kitchen 
utensils. For steaming, salt the water as usual, and 
add to it a good bouquet of herbs (parsley, green 
onions, bay leaf, etc.), then lay the vegetables carefully 
trimmed, washed and dried, on the little steamer, and 
steam them steadily till cooked, when they are lifted 
out, well drained, and served on a very hot vegetable 
dish. Treated in this way, the commonest *' greens " 
will be a revelation to most people. 

A point to remember is that age and condition affect 
the time of cooking very much. A stale, half withered 
vegetable takes twice as long to dress properly, even 
granting it can be brought back to decent condition. 



VEGETABLES. 5 

K you must use such things, however, mind, after well 
washing and rinsing them, to let them stand for 
some time in cold spring water to freshen them. If 
you are using canned vegetables of any kind, turn 
them, directly the tin is opened, into a sieve or colander 
and let the water from the tap run on to them 
for some time, to remove all trace of the "tin" 
flavour such vegetables almost always acquire. Root 
vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, beetroots and 
potatoes, should be stored in layers of sand (having the 
latter thick enough to prevent their touching each 
other in any way) just as they are lifted from the 
ground. Onions for storing should be hung up in a 
cool, dry room. Old housewives used to plait the stalks 
together into ropes, and these were hung from a nail 
in the kitchen. Formerly in London the onion seller 
with his long, neatly plaited " ropes " of silvery onions, 
was a common and welcome sight to thrifty house- 
wives. 

A point on which to be very particular in winter, is 
the danger of vegetables being frost bitten, for then 
they are difficult, and sometimes impossible, to use 
satisfactorily. If, however, the misfortune has 
occurred, try the following method: Prepare the 
vegetables for cooking — cleaning, peeling them, etc. — 
then lay them in enough cold salted water to cover 
them very completely (this is important), and leave 
them thus all night in a warm place. 

Of vegetable garnishes there are many, but these 
will be given later with the vegetables required, such 
recipes being, for convenience sake, given alphabeti- 
cally. The two principal gaxm^^^ ^x^ XXv^ T^ace^c?vrcv.t.^

either hot or cold, and the jardiniere. For the hot 
mao'doine, take equal quantities of carrots and 
turnips cut into balls or olives with a scoop, French 
beans cut into lozenges, peas, fresh flageolets, and 
asparagus points or sprue cut to the size of peas ; cook 
these all separately in salted water, adding to this a 
little sugar in the case of carrots, turnips, and peas. 
When ready (mind they are not over done), drain well, 
mix them and serve ; or else toss them in a very little 
melted butter or appropriate sauce, according to 
what they are to accompany. Or, cut some carrots, 
potatoes and turnips to match some small pickling 
or silver onions (having equal parts of each), boil these 
separately, and, when cooked and drained, toss them 
all together in a saucepan with a good pat of butter, 
till glazed, and keep hot till wanted. These macedoines 
may be served mixed, or each kind in a separate little 
heap, as preferred. It is not necessary to have all, or 
indeed any, of the vegetables given above, for you may 
use any sorts you think most suitable, only bearing in 
mind that for a macedoine there must be at least three 
kinds. If to be served cold cook the vegetables as above 
plainly, and leave them, when thoroughly drained, till 
cold, when they are mixed together with either an oil 
or vinegar dressing or mayonnaise sauce. A little 
fresh liquid aspic may be added in this case, so that they 
will dish rockily. The difference between a jardiniere 
and a macedoine garnish lies chiefly (generally) in the 
way the vegetables are cut, and indeed the names are 
interchangeable with most chefs, though a jardiniere 
is always a hot garnish, whereas, as said above, the 
macedoine may be served hot or cold.

These are naturally only for the ordinary boiled 
vegetables. For more uncommon kinds and dishes, 
the proper time will be indicated in the recipes. 

All green vegetables should be gathered before 
sunrise or after sunset, as if gathered with the sun on 
tbera they go stale very soon, and lose their fresh, 
cnsp flavour. Also remember that any cold vegetables 
make delicious toasts if minced, stirred till hot with 
butter, cream, or stock, piled on hot buttered toast, 
well dusted with grated cheese and set in the oven 
for a minute or two till the cheese is browned. 

Artichokes (Artichauts), — Of these there are three 
kinds, the Globe, the Jerusalem or sunflower (gira- 
sole)y and the latest addition, the Japanese artichoke, or 
Stachys tuberifera, introduced and first grown in this 
country, I beUeve, by Sir Henry Thompson. The 
Globe artichoke, which is, in reality, a kind of thistle, 
may be cooked in a number of ways. To boil it 
plainly (as it is most usually seen in this country), 
the artichoke must first be well soaked in salt and 
water to remove all insects ; then cut off the stalk 
close under the head, take off the hard leaves just at 
the bottom of the globe, and trim off the sharp tops 
of the rest. Now place the artichoke, head downwards, 
into fast-boiling water, salted as for other vegetables 
(use plenty of water, as this removes all chance of the 
bitter flavour sometimes noticed in these vegetables), 
adding to this the juice of a lemon, or a little white 
vinegar, and boil it till the leaves will come off easily 
if lightly pulled. If the artichokes are young (and 
they are only fit for boiling when they are young), 
this wi)] take about half an hour. Drain off every

white pepper, put little morsels of butter over them, 
and stew gently over a slow fire till cooked, when 
they may be served with a maitre d'h6tel sauce (to 
half a pint of rich bechamel or good brown sauce — ^if 
you wish it brown — add the strained juice of a lemon, 
a dust of cayenne, a teaspoonful of minced parsley, 
and, worked in at the last, l^oz. to 2oz. of butter broken 
up small, working one piece well in before adding the 
next), or any other sauce to your taste. Artichokes 
cooked thus are excellent cold en vinaigrette (i.«., 
three parts best oUve oil to one part tarragon vinegar, 
seasoned to taste with salt and pepper, and beaten 
up with a fork till perfectly blended. To this some 
cooks add a little French or English mustard, but this 
is a matter of taste ; beat up the salt first with the 
vinegar, or it will not dissolve, and the sauce will be 
unpleasantly gritty, an objection often made against 
this sauce) ; artichokes en salade are also delicious 
and easy to prepare. Trim as before, then quarter 
them and remove the choke, dropping each piece as 
finished into cold water, to which you have added 
the juice of a lemon or a tablespoonful of best white 
vinegar, as this preserves the colour. Leave them 
in this water for a Uttle ; when wanted, slice them 
and serve with a vinaigrette sauce, plain or with 
prawns, olives, fiUetted anchovies, plovers' eggs, &c., 
as you please. Artichokes treated thus, or indeed plain 
cooked artichokes left till cold and sliced, make excel- 
lent fritters, if seasoned with pepper, salt, oil, and 
vinegar, and as Artichauts en beignets are a favourite 
dish abroad. Stuffed artichokes go by many names, 
according to their stuffing raosXX^^ T\v^ \x\fttliod of 



preparation is this : Trim the artichokes as b^re. 
and boil for twenty minutes in salted and acidnlated 
water ; the stamens and snail nmer leayes should 
now Eft out easily, then with a aihrer apoon rrano^e 
the choke, fill the cayity thus left with anv faar^ to 
taste, introducing a little ako between the leavesw 
and tie each up closely to keep in the stui&ig, place 
them close together on a baking tin, pour sufficient 
ohve ml oyer them to insure ^ch being properly 
moistened, and bake for about half an hour, then 
remoye the strings and serre. If you make a 
d'uxelUs (equal quantities c^ onicaL and shallots, 
Diinced, with douUe the quantity of raw minced 
mushrooms, seasoned with pepper and salt and some 
finely minced parsley, aD fried together in butter), 
add to this a Uttle bacon minced (say a small slice for 
each artichoke), and use for the farce, the artichokes 
will be a {a barigauU ; if you mince some washed and 
boned anchoyies with a shallot or two (according 
to quantity), and a yery httle powdered thyme, pepper, 
and salt, a few freshly made breadcrumbs, and a few 
drops of oil to moisten it all, and use this as the stuftifig, 
they become a Vltalienne ; if you mince threo wM 
cleansed targe fresh mushrooms, and mix it with i> 
slice or so of ham also minced, half a MrriHll onioft 
fried and minced, ^oz. grated cheeae, a full ttiM\niiiuUi\

Artichoke bottoms are perhaps more generally used 
than the whole vegetable, probably because they are 
so easily canned, and they produce many vegetable 
entremets. Where artichokes are home grown, it may 
be useful for the cook to know how to preserve 
them, in itself no difficult matter. Boil the artichokes 
in plenty of fast-boiling, salted, and acidulated water 
till the leaves will Hft out easily. Then drain them 
well, remove all the leaves, and carefully scoop out 
the choke with a silver spoon ; trim and drain the 
bottoms well, strain them dry, and set them on a 
baking tin in the oven till firm. Store in an air- 
tight box, and to serve them, re-heat in any sauce 
to taste, and serve when thoroughly hot. To cook 
artichoke bottoms from the fresh plant, cut off the 
top leaves, trim the under ones, and boil them in 
slightly salted water till they peel easily ; now skin, 
re-trim, and cook them in salted acidulated water with 
a little butter and flour (this keeps the colour good) 
and leave them till cold in this liquor. 

Artichoke bottoms are cooked in many ways. 
For instance — Fried artichoke bottoms: For these 
parboil fresh ones, or re-heat the well-washed canned 
ones in boiling acidulated water till thoroughly hot, 
then either dip them in batter or in beaten egg and 
breadcrumbs, and fry a golden brown in plenty of 
hot fat. Fonds d'artichauts meringues: Prepare a 
rich puree of mushrooms, with ^Ib, of mushrooms, 
re-heat some nice artichoke bottoms, put a good 
spoonful of the puree into each, piling it well up,

coralline pepper, and a thickening of Joz. of arrowroot 
rubbed smooth in two tablespoonfuls of mushroom 
essence or liquor, stir it all till it boils, then stir into 
it some cooked asparagus points cut in inch lengths, 
and some sUced truffles, and keep them hot till wanted 
(asparagus left over from the previous day may be 
utilised thus). Meanwhile heat some cooked arti- 
choke bottoms in the oven in a Ughtly buttered tin 
with a wineglassful of sherry, till the latter is all but 
absorbed ; have ready some sliced tomatoes half 
an inch thick, previously baked in a buttered tin (with 
a seasoning of pepper and minced parsley), covered 
with a buttered paper for twelve or fifteen minutes ; 
then place an artichoke on each sUce of tomato, fill 
up the centre with the asparagus and truflle ragout 
and serve. CJooked artichoke bottoms left till cold, 
then seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, 
are constantly used filled with vegetables and other 
ragouts, or small mayonnaises or salades a la mignonne. 
Artichokes^ Jeribsalem (Topinambours). — ^These are 
really a sort of sunflower, and derive their name from 
the well-known sunflower habit of turning to the sun. 
They were introduced originally by the Spaniards 
from South America, and their French name is a 
corruption of that of the native tribe from which 
they were oHginally derived. To boil them, wash 
and peel them, trimming them as much to a size 
as possible. Some cooks cut them into cones, or 
balls, but this is a wasteful process, and it is best to 
choose the vegetables as much of a size as possible. 
Each must be dropped as trimmed into acidulated salt

and water, or they will blacken. The method of cooking 
depends on their age. If young, put them on in 
boiling salted water (two tablespoonfuls of salt to tlie 
gallon of water) ; in the middle of the season put thorn 
on in vxirm salted water ; and when they are old let the 
water be cold. They take about twenty minutoH 
boiling from the time the water boils up after thoy 
are put in, and should, when cooked, be quite tender. 
Drain them and serve with white sauce (jv«r thorn. 
If liked they can be lifted out when three partH (;()ok(5(l, 
and finished oil in rich brown stock or gravy, whon 
they are known as Topinambours au jus. Or lift thoni

bake on a buttered tin, serving them with oiled or plain 
melted butter, or either a vinaigrette, or any naiico 
to taste. These are known as topinambours au four. 
Or again, when three parts cooked, put tliern into 
a pan with a nice white sauce, to which you have 
added one or more tablespoonfuls of grated ParrnrjHan 
cheese, salt, and a dust of coralline pepper, and let 
them simmer gently till cooked, when thay aro

they are finished as before, they are known as T,

in a pan with a small pat of butter and enough tomato 
sauce to cover them well, they are, when cooked, 
served as T. aux tomates. If, when cooked as before, 
they are sUced into a well-buttered silver or fireproof 
dish, strewn with lightly baked breadcrumbs, grated 
cheese, pepper, salt, minced parsley, and a squeeze 
of lemon juice, a few morsels of butter scattered ovo,^

the top, and baked for ten to fifteen minutes, they are 
served as T. au gratin, a name also appHed to the 
following : Have ready a puree of artichoke, dilute 
it slightly with veloute or white sauce, season it with 
freshly ground black pepper and salt, and turn it into 
a well-buttered fireproof dish, dust it with freshly- 
grated cheese (a spoonful or so may be mixed with 
the puree if liked), and bake till the top is nicely 
coloured. 

Jerusalem Artichoke Mould {Creme de topinambours). 
— Make a puree with 2lb. of artichokes, by rubbing 
them when cooked through a sieve, and when sieved 
stir into it a custard made with half a pint of new milk 
and the yolks of four eggs, whisk it all well together, 
then add the white of one egg, pepper and salt ; turn 
it all into a buttered mould, and steam it for an hour. 
Turn it out, and serve with either tomato, maitre 
d'h6tel, or veloute sauce, or the simpler sauce given 
for Artichokes a la Morny, If preferred, the mould, 
when cold, may be set on ice, and when icy cold, 
turned out and served with iced savoury cream 
or iced mayonnaise sauce. Most vegetables can 
be treated in this way successfully, especially black 
salsify or scorzanera, if a few drops of essence of 
anchovy be added to the diluting sauce. 

Mashed {Puree de topinambours). — Wash, 

peel, and boil the vegetable in salted milk or water, 
or half and half, till tender, then drain and rub them 
through a sieve ; squeeze all the water from them, 
put the puree into a clean pan, with a small piece of 
butter, a spoonful of cream, white pepper, salt if 
necessary, and a tiny grate of nutmeg if liked, stir 



VEGETABLES. 17 

it all over the fire till fairly dry and quite hot, and 
serve. 

Jerusalem Artichoke Chips, — Peel and slice some 
rather lai^e artichokes, dropping them as you do 
80 into salted and acidulated water to preserve the 
colour, then, when wanted, Uft them out with a slice, 
drain and lay them on a clean cloth, dry well, put 
a few at a time into the frying basket, and fry 
like potato chips. Drain well, and serve dusted with 
a little salt and coralline pepper. 

Fritters, — SUce some parboiled artichokes^ 

quarter of an inch thick, flour these lightly, egg and 
breadcrumb them, and fry a golden brown in plenty 
of hot fat. Or they may be cut into fingers, dipped 
in frying batter, and fried as before. 

Artichoke^ Japanese (Stachys Japonais). — This 
may be treated in the same way as the ordinary 
Jerusalem artichoke, though it is a trifle more delicate 
in flavour. Do not use strongly flavoured sauces 
with it, or the special aroma will be lost. It is delicious 
served cold with plain cream. Or when cold it may 
be shced and served with, either a French or a mayon- 
naise dressing. 

Asparagus (Asperges). — ^These should be carefully 
picked over, the stalks well scraped with the back of 
a knife, and made into small bundles, keeping the 
heads very even ; then with a sharp knife cut the 
stalks also even, and tie the bundles up with a tape. 

There are two methods of cooking them, the old 
and the new. The former is to lay them longways 
into fast boiling salted water (allow ^ oz. salt to half 
a gallon of water), with a lump of su^ar, and hovl 



18 VEGETABLES. 

sharply, uncovered, for ten to twenty minutes ; then 
lift them out very carefully, drain well, remove the 
tape, and serve on a trebly folded napkin with any 
sauce to taste. The great objection to this method 
is that half the time the stalks are not cooked, whilst 
the heads are overdone, and usually floating looBs.on 
the water. The new method is that advised by Sir 
H. Thompson in his valuable little book, on " Food 
and Feeding." For this you require properly a 
small frame made for the purpose, but, failing this, 
cut the stalks very even, and tie them up in a bundle 
large enough to keep steady, then place them upright 
in a deep pan, with boiling water to within two inches 
of the tops. In this way the heads will only be steamed 
and will be just cooked right, though kept on the 
fire for thirty to forty minutes, which time will 
render the major part of the stalk tender and eatable, 
instead of, as usually happens, tough and stringy 
from insufficient cooking. Having cooked the aspara- 
gus, lift it out and dish as above on a delicately white 
and triply folded napkin The old-fashioned custom 
of dishing this (and other vegetables) on a slice of 
toast is a relic of barbarism, dating from the days 
when cooks were careless about draining their veget- 
ables. Never serve the sauce in the dish with the 
asparagus, but always in a separate boat. Some 
gourmets aver that to eat asparagus in perfection it 
should be served if hot with a cold (if not actually iced) 
sauce, or if cold with a hot sauce. The favourite sauces 
for this vegetable, if served hot, are white sauce 
(see Sauce blanche), Sauce mousseuse (season half a gill 
of boiling water with nutmeg, pepper, and salt, stir in 



YE6ETABLES. 19 

the yolks of two eggs, and whisk this all well together 
at the side of the store without letting it hoil ; then 
work in bit by bit 4oz. of butter broken up small, 
whisking it all till it looks like cream ; now add a 
squeeze of lemon juice and serre in a hot tureen ; 
this sauce is equally good with artichoke bottoms, 
cold slaw, &c.), oiled butter (beurre fondu)^ Hollandaise ; 
or Sauce mousseline (for this put half a gill of cream, 
four egg yolks, a pinch of salt, a grate of nutmeg, and 
three crushed peppercorns into a pan, and stand this 
in the bain marie, or in another larger pan, half filled 
with boiling water, and whisk it aU together with 
a whisk, adding loz. of butter (cut up into very 
small pieces) gradually, not adding one piece till the 
previous one is perfectly amalgamated, and whisking 
it all the time ; when the sauce looks like a rich frothy 
cream it is ready, and for company purposes should 
be tammied, and just before serving should be finished 
off with a few drops of lemon juice) ; for cold asparagus 
use plain iced cream seasoned with a little white pepper, 
maj^onnaise, or tomato cream, &c. The water in 
which the asparagus was cooked is always best as 
a foundation for the sauces used with it, but always 
be careful to keep the sauce delicate, or the natural 
flavour of the asparagus will be lost. This is not so 
important when canned asparagus is used. The 
latter, by the way, should always be served cold» 
thus : Lift it carefully from the tin, or bottle, on 
to a colander, and let the water from the tap run on it 
for a minute or two, then set it on ice till wanted. 
Be careful in lifting it, for the heads break very easily,

as asperges en branches, sauce, dtc, according to the 
sauce chosen. Asparagus left over from a previoui 
meal is also delicious if the tender part is cut into inch 
lengths, two or three pieces being dipped together in 
good frying batter, and dropped into boiling fat till 
delicately coloured, then well drained, dusted lightly 
with coralline pepper, and served as pointes d'asperges 
en beignets, or asparagus fritters. Or lay the cooked 
asparagus in a well-buttered and crumb-sprinkled 
piedish, dusting each row, as it is put in, with white 
pepper, a little salt, and grated Parmesan cheese, finish 
off with seasoned white breadcrumbs, a squeeze of 
lemon juice, and sufficient oiled butter to moisten it 
all, and bake till hot and lightly coloured ; serving 
it as scalloped A. or A. au gratin. Or cut the green 
part of the cooked asparagus into pieces the size of 
peas, and toss these in a pan, with sufficient butter to 
moisten it, pepper, salt, and a squeeze of lemon juice, 
over a slow fire till hot, and serve sls A, en petits pais. 
For obvious reasons, unless there is any asparagus 
left over, it is better, for this dish, to use asparagus 
sprue (long slender sprouts which run up after the 
blanching of the asparagus is over), as these have the 
right flavour, but are cheaper, as they are useless 
for decorative purposes. Asparagus sprue treated 
as above and inserted in the folds of a savoury 
or cheese omelet, makes a delicious and uncommon 
dish. 

Aubergine, Brinjal, or Egg Plant (by all of which 
names this vegetable is known), is one that is every 
year more often seen, and deserves far more attention 
than it has hitherto attained. It certainly offers ao 



VEGETABLES. 21 

agreeable change at a season when vegetable changes 
are hard to discover, and may be cooked in the 
following ways : 

Atibergine, baked, — Choose the vegetables as much of 
a size as possible, wash them and set them on a baking 
tin in the oven (a moderate one), and bake from one 
to one and a half hours, turning them now and again 
whilst cooking. These are excellent with roast meat. 
They may be roasted also in an American oven in front 
of the fire, cooking them very slowly, and placing a 
tiny pat of butter on each as you send it to table. 

grilled. — Slice the aubergine through in 

^in. thick shces, and grill them over a clear fire. 
When nicely browned on both sides send to table on 
a hot dish, sprinkled with a little salt, and freshly 
^ound black pepper. 

stuffed. — Scoop the centre of the fruit out 

and fill it with any nice mince (such as you wotild use 
for stuffed tomatoes), raising it in a dome shape 
and scattering it with browned sifted breadcrumbs, 
bake for twenty-five to thirty minutes. Or, peel and 
halve the aubergines, remove the centre, and mince 
this finely with some chives, parsley, the pulp of a 
tomato or two (according to the number cooked), 
minced parsley, the yolk of one or more hard-boiled 
eggs, some well-washed and boned anchovies minced, 
a little grated Parmesan cheese, and some crumb of 
bread scalded either in boiling stock or seasoned boiling 
water, and squeezed fairly dry. Stuff the aubergine 
with this mixture, dust with sifted and browned 
crumbs, sprinkle with oil, set in a baking tin with a 
Kttle oil and water in it, and bake m Oar on^xv. 



22 VEGETABLES. 

Avhergines, stuffed. — Halve four aubergines length- 
ways, scoop out some of the flesh, and mince this with 
half its bulk of crumbs soaked in strong stock, and the 
same amount of minced mushrooms, seasoning it all 
with salt, pepper, minced parsley, and three or four 
minced shallots ; stir in 2oz. of fat ham or bacon 
minced, with a teaspoonful of olive oil, and fry it 
all till par-cooked in l^z. of butter. Now stuff the 
aubergines with this mixture, smooth over with a 
hot, wet knife, dust with breadcrumbs, and bake 
for twenty-five to thirty minutes. 

a la Languedocienne. — ^Halve the veget- 
ables lengthways, remove the seeds, and with the 
point of a sharp knife score the inside across and across 
in squares or lozenges, being careful not to pierce 
the skin, sprinkle well with fine salt, freshly ground 
black pepper, and a grate of nutmeg, and grill over 
a clear, gentle fire, moistening it now and again with 
salad oil. 

fried. — ^Peel and slice down the aubergines 

lengthways, scoring the inside as described in the 
previous recipe, dust them with fine salt, and leave 
them on a drainer ; when wanted press them well 
in a clean cloth to extract the bitter juice that 
flows from them, then fry as they are in hot oil ; 
or, they may be dipped in egg and breadcrumbs and 
fried in hot fat, or if preferred, dip them into frying 
batter and fry a golden brown. Drain well, dust 
with coralline pepper, and serve. 

scalloped. — ^Three parts cook some nice 

aubergines, slice, and with a plain cutter, stamp the

them for five minutes in lemon juioe or Tinegar. Beat 
up two egg yolks with a tahlespoonful each of cream 
and new milk, seasoning this well with salt, freshlj 
ground Uack pepper, a tiny grate of nutm^, and 
a few drops of essence ai anchovy. Now drain 
the sUces from the acid, lay them in a well-huttered 
piedish, or china or scallop shells, previously dusted 
with finely grated breadcrumbs and minced parslej 
or chives, pour the egg, milk, &c., over thenu strew 
the top with seasoned breadcrumbs, and bake just 
enough to heat it all thoroughly, and to colour the 
crumbs. 

Aubergines a la Turqtie. — Cut the ends from the 
egg plant, and remove the centre of the fruit with a 
teaspoon, replacing this with a mixture of equal 
parts of cold cooked rice and minced cooked meat, 
seasoning with blanched and finely minced onion, 
freshly ground black pepper, and salt ; now fry the 
fruit with a bouquet (thyme, parsley, bay leaf, &c.) 
in oil, butter, or clarified dripping, for two or three 
minutes, then drain it, lay in a stew pan with sufficient 
thin" tomato sauce to cover it and the bunch of 
herbs, and stew gently till tender ; then remove the 
herbs and dish the vegetable on a hot dish with the 
tomato sauce over and round it. As a general principle 
the aubergine may be cooked by any process adopted 
for tomatoes, with which, indeed, foreign cooks treat 
it as interchangeable. 

Balm (Baume). — ^This herb was formerly more used 
than it is in the present day, when its chief use is as 
a flavouring for claret-cup, and such like drinks.

as common as oranges, and are fast becoming a stand- 
ing dish in our menus. Their flesh is wonderfully 
nourishing, and when reduced to flour is largely used 
in the preparation of yarious cakes, puddings, &c. 

They are equally good served as vegetables, especially 
if used when half ripe, or green. The following are 
eome of the ways in which they may be utilised for 
this purpose : 

BananaSy boiled, — Peel and halve six or seven green 
bananas, and put them in a pan with a breakfastcupful 
of milk, a teaspoonf ul of salt, half that of white pepper, 
and simmer them gently and steadily for twenty-five 
to thirty minutes. Make a roux with a tablespoonf ul 
of butter and a dessertspoonful of flour, pour the 
liquid from the bananas on to it, stir all together, 
and let it just boil up. Place the bananas on a hot 
dish, and serve with the sauce over them. 

curried, — Put a teacupful of desiccated 

eocoanut into a basin and pour half a pint of milk 
over it, then cover down the basin and let it stand 
for one hour. Peel and slice six or seven green 
bananas, and put them into a pan with an ounce of 
butter in which you have previously fried a good 
tablespoonful of curry powder, and brown them 
hghtly. Now add to them a teaspoonful of essence of 
anchovies, a teaspoonful of either Worcester sauce 
or of Yorkshire Rehsh, a little salt and cayenne, and 
last of all the milk in which the eocoanut was steeped. 
Let it all simmer together for a quarter of an hour, 
then stir in a well-beaten whole egg, and dish very hot 
in a wall of nicely boiled rice.

lengthways, and treated exactly as deacribed ior 
aubergines. 

Basil {Basilic), — ^A iaTomite araiifwing herb on the 
continent, where it generally ia connected with 
tomatoes, whose flaTour it is supposed greatly to 
enhance. In this country it is chiefly used amongst 
the herbs added to turtle, mock turtle, and other 
gelatinous soups. Basil vinegar, (made hke tarragon 
vinegar) is often added to salad dressinga. 

Bay Leaf {FeuiUe de laurier). — ^These are much 
used for flavouring, and generally appear in the 
bouquet garni. Best used fresh, but if gathered 
in the summer, tied in bunches, and hung up in a 
warm dry place in a paper bag to keep off the dust, 
they are very usefuL A very good extract may be 
made, when leaves are plentiful, by packing them 
pretty tightly in a bottle and pouring on to them 
sufficient rectified spirit to cover them weQ ; let this 
stand ten days, then bottle ofl and seal. Thk gives 
a nice flavour, but must be used carefully, or it may 
give a slightly resinous taste. 

Beans, — Of these there are, in this country at lea«t, 
really only two kinds of fresh beans, the broad hean 
and the haricot bean, the la^ being divided into two 
varieties, the dwarf or French bean, and the *r:ariet 
runner. Besides these there are the dried heariii, the 
flagecUts, the haricot or SoLasons beans, the \ahia 
or butter bean (very good fresh^ but seldom or ever 
seen in that state in this country;, and the .>>»ith 
American black bean* also known as frijoUs,

but horse feed ; indeed, unless very young, they should 
always be cooked until the skins crack, then shelled,, 
and served, after being tossed over the fire with a pat 
of butter, lemon juice, pepper and salt, and some 
minced parsley ; or worked into a pretty stiff purJe. 
To boil broad beans, put them on in absolutely boiling 
water, and cook them very gently till the skins cracky 
which, if fairly young, they will do in twenty to twenty- 
five minutes ; then at once lift them out, drain them 
remove the skins by rubbing them on a clean cloth, 
and toss them till quite hot in butter, &c. as described 
above ; or put them when shelled into good parsley 
or maitre d'hotel sauce, and cook them gently till 
ready. There are two points to be remembered in 
cooking beans — (1) be careful with the salt, for if too- 
much is put in they burst and spoil, so it is better to 
put in too little, as more can be added when re-heating 
them. (2) Cook beans always very slowly, especially 
if getting elderly, but remember that once broad beaoft 
are really old nothing will soften them, and prolonged 
cooking only serves to harden them. For a purees. 
boil the beans in plain salted water (^oz. salt to half 
a gallon of water is about the right average) till tender 
enough to rub through a sieve ; then stir them over 
the fire to a stiff mash, seasoning them with salt,, 
pepper, and minced parsley, and moistening them 
with butter or thick cream. 

Beans and Bacon. — Put into a pan a nice piece of 
back or streaky bacon, with plenty of water to cover 
it, then boil it for half an hour, when you add in the^ 
beans and cook them together till the latter are 
tender. They can then be dramed off and served plain

are old enough for this, it is better, where possible, 
to let them grow till the bean can be shelled from the 
pod, and then serve them (either fresh or dried) as 
flageolets. To boil French beans {haricots verts) 
remove the string, &c., as mentioned before, and put 
them on in plenty of absolutely boiling lightly salted 
water, with a teaspoonful of sugar for a good dish, 
and boil them fast in an uncovered pan for ten minutes 
if young, but allowing from ten to twenty if old. 
Drain well and serve plain, or mixed with any saucci 
such as maitre d'hotel, bechamel, parsley butter, 
Hollandaise, Soubise, tomato, &c., to taste. It takes 
about a gill of sauce for each pound or pint of beans. 
Some cooks, to ensure the colour and crispness of 
their beans, add a morsel of soda, the size of a small peai 
to the boiling water, but this effectually prevents 
the use of the bean liquor for soup-making, for 
which it is very useful ; if the beans are young and 
fresh the plan given above answers admirably ; 
whilst if by any chance the beans are none of the 
freshest and brightest to start with, if you cook them 
at all, it is best to stew them thus : Butter a stew pm, 
Jay in the beans, dust them with salt, and cover them

thus may be drained, served with beurr noir, or 
noisette (i.e., fry 2oz. to ioz. of butter till of a rich brown^ 
then add to this half a gill of tarragon vinegar, a 
little pepper, and either minced green tarragon or 
parsley, as you please). Or again, mince enough 
fat bacon to make two tablespoonfuls, mix this 
with about a teaspoonful of finely minced onion,, 
shallot, or chives, and fry these together till the onioni 
colours Ughtly, then lay in the cooked and drained, 
beans, with a Uttle lemon juice or vinegar to taste, 
and toss it aU over the fire for a minute or two till 
it is all thoroughly heated, and serve very hot. This 
is the well known haricots verts au lard. Scarlet 
runners, when young enough, are cooked exactly like 
French beans. 

Haricots verts jHxnachcs. — ^W. in the usual way, 
separately, about a pint of old shelled French beans 
{flageolets) and a quarter of a peck of young beans, 
strung but not sliced. When these are quite cooked, 
drain them well, toss each lot in butter for a minute 
or two till glazed, then mix and serve very hot. 

French bean salad. — Boil very young beans that 
only need stringing, drain and dry on a clean cloth. 
When perfectly cold season them with freshly ground 
black pepper and salt, sprinkle them generously 
with oil, then at the last add a few drops of best 
tarragon or chili vinegar, and sprinkle lightly with 
minced green tarragon and chives if liked. Some 
people dress old beans, when cooked and cold, with 
black pepper, salt, cream, and lemon juice.

well at last with salt ; lay a clean cloth over it, and 
»cover down the crock with a clean, dry slate, and

Lima (butter beans). — ^These are, when 

ifresh and young, cooked whole, in plain salted water, 
then drained and served with a pat of butter, a squeeze 
of lemon juice, white pepper, and salt. But when 
•dried, soak, say, a breakfast cupfid of the beans for 
two to four hours (some cooks soak them all night), 
then drain well and cook in plenty of boiling ssdted 
water till tender, which they should be in an hour. 
Then turn them out on to a hot vegetable dish with 
some morsels of butter, toss them together till this 
is melted, and serve hot. These beans are usually 
•chosen for the well-known American dish of baked 
beans and pork. For this you soak a pint of the beans 
overnight, and boil them next day for about three- 
• quarters of an hour in a pint of salted water, then lift 
them out when the skin breaks easily, drain them well, 
put half into a pipkin (in America a proper bean-pot is 
used), lay on this about Jib. of salt pork after scoring 
the rind well, cover it with the rest of the beans, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, then pour over them 
a tablespoonful of molasses and enough salted water 
to cover them, put the lid on closely, and bake in a 
slow oven for six to eight hours. The white haricot 
beans may also be used for this, but then use white 
«ugar instead of the molasses, and bake for nearly 
»double the time.

Butter beans when boiled and drained are excellent 
vhen served with maitre d'hotel butter, or any sauce 
to taste. 

Beans, flageolets.— These, when dried, should be 
blanched for five minutes in boiling salt and water, then 
drained and thrown into cold water, well rinsed in this, 
and again drained off ; now boil them in fresh salted 
water till quite tender, when you pour off the water, 
and toss them for a few minutes with butter, pepper 
and salt. If properiy cooked they ought to be quite 
glossy. They can also be served, when cooked, with 
any sauce to taste. When used fresh, i.e., when 
too old to serve in the pod, though still green, they 
are cooked precisely like peas, only omitting the spray 
of mint. 

Beans, Haricot, dried (Haricots blancs), — ^These are 
the dried seeds of the haricot bean, sometimes also called 
the Soissons beans ; they make an excellent vegetable 
when fresh ones are not easy to procure, and if pro- 
periy cooked are as nourishing as they are appetising. 
Well wash lib. of these beans and put them on in a 
large saucepan full of soft water (beans, like other 
'vegetables, are the better for plenty of water whilst 
cooking, whilst if hard water be used they toughen 
in the cooking and never get soft ; it must also be 
remembered that these beans must only be simmered, 
for if allowed to boil at all hard they will burst and 
spoil), let this just boil up (not more), then draw the 
pan to the side of the stove, and only allow them 
to simmer till they are about half done. They 
take from two to three hours altogether. You now 
add a little salt, and ^oz. or so of butter or clax\^^^

dripping, and let them cook again till done, which 
you can make sure of by pressing one between your 
finger and thumb, and if tender the beans are ready. 
Now strain them oi! and save the liquor, which is 
a most excellent basis for many kinds of soup (indeed, 
few English women appear to know that haricot soup 
made precisely like our national peas soup is a capital 
variante on that deservedly popular winter puree). 
The beans are now ready to be served in a variety of 
ways. Ex, gra. : Brown deUcately a minced (medium 
sized) onion in loz. of clarified dripping, then at once 
stir in the beans, dusting them with a Uttle sifted flour, 
stirring and moistening them gradually with one 
or two spoonfuls of the liquor they were cooked in, 
then let them cook gently at the side of the fire, in a 
covered pan, for ten to fifteen minutes, and serve as 
stewed haricots, or H, a la Lyonnaise. Or, stir the 
strained beans in a clean pan with ^oz. or so of butter, 
tossing them in this, and adding a tablespoonful of 
veloutc sauce, wliite pepper and salt, and at the last 
the yolks of one or more eggs, and serve as H. 
Monceaux. Or, stir to the strained beans two or 
three tablespoonfuls of any good gravy, till it is all 
quite hot, adding at the last ^oz, of fresh butter, 
and serve very hot, as H. au jus. If the beans are 
served as in the preceding recipe, only using veloute, 
bechamel, or melted butter for the gravy, moistening 
it at the last with a good pat of maitre d'hotel butter, 
the beans are known as H. a la Francaise, or a. la 
maitre d'hutel. Prepared according to any of these 
recipes they are excellent as a separate vegetable, 
whilst, if arranged, when drained, round a well

dice, and toss it in butter for a few minutes, then stir 
in the drained beans, season with pepper and salt, 
and serve when very hot. 

puree. — ^When the beans are cooked and 

drained rub them through a hair sieve, moistening 
it with a Httle stock, season to taste and use. 

Beetroot (Betterave). — ^These are usually boiled 
thus : Wash the roots well, but be careful not to 
chip or break them in any way (a knife must on no 
account be used), or the juice will run, and the beet 
will be left colourless and flavourlesSd When perfectly 
clean put it on in a panful of boiling, slightly salted 
water, and cook it for one and a half to two hours, 
according to size. When cooked the skin is peeled 
off, and the root sUced, when it may be served hot with 
either a poulette sauce (veloute sauce, to which at the 
last are added the yolks of two eggs — ^for a pint of 
sauce — and at the very last ^z. of fresh butter broken 
up very small, with a drop or two of essence of mush-

Beetroot, baked,— This is by most people considered 
the best way of cooking beetroot. You prepare it 
in the same way, then put it in a slack oven and let 
it bake very slowly for several hours (from four 
to eight hours) according to size and the slackness of 
the oven. When cooked, peel and sUce as before. 
It is very nice served hot thus : Toss half a finely

It must be remembered that it is not oidy the 
root of the beet that is edible ; the leaves when young- 
are excellent treated exactly Uke spinach, a remark 
by the way that applies also to young nettles and 
watercress. Cooked thus the leaves are particularly^ 
good if minced, reheated in white sauce, seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and served on croutons of fried, or 
toasted and buttered bread.

Brussels Sprouts {Chova de BruxelUs). — ^Trim the

this, for they harbour insects terribly), put them on in 
plenty of boiling and well salted water, and boil them 
sharply in an uncovered pan. They must be pressed 
down Occasionally under the water whilst cooking.

not be overdone, or they are spoilt. Drain them very

Igi^n and quite tender. Always choose the smallest 
grouts, the large ones are fit for nothing but a pur^, 
in which form, however, they are capital, though 
^dom seen. Brussels sprouts may be cooked in 
many ways. For instance, when almost cooked, 
%itraia them and dry them gently in a clean cloth, 
4^h^li toss them over the fire with a good piece of butter, 
pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg to taste, till 
thoroughly cooked. Or, parboil the sprouts, then 
lay them in a pan when well drained and dried, with 
pepper, salt, and grated nutmeg, and finish cooking 
in some good strong stock or gravy, serving them as 
Chotuc de Bruxelles au jus. Or bechamel or maitre 
d^ hotel or allemande sauce may be used instead of the 
gravy, of course varying the name. Or cold sprouts 
may be lightly fried in butter or clarified dripping, 
seasoned with pepper and salt, and served piping hot. 
They need care in the frying, or the colour will be 
spoilt. Or, lastly, a layer of cold sprouts may be 
placed in a fireproof dish, covered with a layer of 
grated cheese, minced parsley, a very little chives 
or shalot, pepper and salt, then more sprouts, and so 
on till the dish is full, finishing with the cheese, &c., 
to which you add a few fine breadcrumbs, and some 
morsels of butter or clarified dripping, then set it in

Brussels sprouts d la creme, — Soak, trim, and well

and put them in a saut^ or frying pan, with about 
half a gin of good veloute sauce, season with salt,

cream or new milk, and let them simmer very gently 
for five minutes or so, tossing them pretty constantly 
over the fire. Serve very hot. 

Burnet. — ^A herb formerly much more used than 
at present, both in salads and sauces. At one time 
it was an indispensable part of a ravigotte composed 
of green tarragon, burnet, chives, and chervil, all 
delicately minced. 

Cabbage {chou). — Trim of! the outer leaves from 
two summer cabbages, halve them lengthways, and 
steep them for an hour in acidulated salted water ; 
now put them into just boiling water, and when they 
have boiled fast for fifteen to twenty minutes, pour 
off the first water and replace it with fresh boiling 
and salted water, and cook till done, (.ilways boil 
in plenty of water.) Test with a skewer to see if it 
is cooked, and then place it on a drainer by the fire 
till all the water is drained off, and serve^ 

Cabbages are really better if steamed, though 



38^ YEGETABLES. 

cQoks aver the colour is not so good, but this i3 chiefly 
a matter of care. Some people also place the cabbages 
before serving between two plates, to eitract all 
possible moisture, but the pressure must be even 
and gentle, or the vegetable will become a " mash." 
It takes half an hour to cook altogether. A tea- 
spoonful of sugar to every dessertspoonful of salt is 
a great improvement. If properly cooked soda is 
absolutely unnecessary. 

Oahhage cake. — ^Wash and boil a large cabbage, 
put it in a colander, and press out all the water with 
a TjRversed plate. Butter a piedish, and dust with 
crumbs,. then put in a layer of cabbage, then a layer 
of ; any firiely-minced cold cooked meat, repeating 
these layers till the dish is full, when you cover with 
four or five slices of fat bacon, and set it in a moderate 
oven. When the bacon is cooked, and the rest heated 
through (in about forty minutes), turn it out and 
serve with gravy round it.

as for boiling, drain it well, dust it lightly with salt, 
then lay it in, or on, the steamer ; fill the under part 
quite half full of boiUng water, and boil it all sharply 
over a quick fire for fifteen minutes or so, according 
to size.

variety of ways, besides plainly boiled, with very 
little trouble. For instance, a la maitre d'hotel : 
Boil the cabbage whole as above, then when cooked

halve it lengthways, arrange it neatly on a hot dish,

(Savoys are especially good cooked thus;) Or prepare 
the cabbage as above, turn it out in a neat pile, and 
cut it shai^y into squares, finishing as in the previous 
recipe. Or, alaorhne: When cooked turn the cabbage 
out on a board, shred it finely, and toss it in a pan 
with ^ to los. of butter, pepper, salt, nutmeg, and 
(if liked) powdered mixed spice, moistening it gradu- 
aUy with cream, allowing it all to simmer very gently 
till the cream is absorbed, and serve hot. (The 
cabbage must be rather underboiled at first for this 
dish). Or, au lard: Boil and shred the cabbage 
as before ; have ready equal quantities of ham or 
bacon (fat and lean), and onions, cut into dice, and 
fry these together till the onion is just coloured, 
and the bacon nearly done, then stir in the shred 
cabbage, seasoning it with a little pepper, and stir 
it altogether over the fire till the bacon id quite cooked 
and the cabbage perfectly hot. Cold cooked cabbage- 
is excellent rechauffe thus. 

Cabbage, slewed. — Cut the stalk of a good firm 
cabbage off close, trim and quarter the cabbage, 
and soak it for an hour or two in cold, salted, and 
acidulated water ; then drain well, and lay the quarters 
in plenty of fast boiling salted water, and boil uncovered 
for twenty minutes (more or less according to size) ; 
then drain well on a reversed sieve. Meanwhile 
mince a good slice (from 2 to 3oz.) of fat bacon with a 
Uttle shallot and soine powdered sweet herbs, salt 
and pepper, and spice to taste ; fry it all till the bacon 
is melted, then lay in the drained and shred cabbage.

to the sauce chosen. 

Cabbage, red, — ^Though seldom seen in this country 
saVe ad pickled cabbage, this is an excellent vegetable 
if treated by any of the recipes given above. Or the 
following German recipes may be tried : C. rouge 
a Vallemande. Trim, soak, and quarter a good red 
cabbage, then bring it to the boil in cold salted water, 
drawing it to the side of the stove directly it has boiled 
tip, and draining of! the water ; and let it simmer in 
sufficient boiling weak or second stock to cover it, 
with half a gill of good vinegar, till it is tender. Now 
turn it out, shred it finely, then return it to the pan 
with its liquor, and a little more stock if needed, 
season with salt, pepper, a teaspoonful of moist sugar, 
and ^oz. of butter. Mix this all well, and let it boil 
up, then serve at once very hot. Or, prepare a good 
red cabbage as above, and when drained put it on 
with a large pat of butter, and let it stew in this till 
tender, stirring to it when perfectly cooked a liaison of 
one or more egg yolks beaten up with a little cream or

Carrots {Garottes), — ^These are naturally only at 
their best when young, for then the hard core is not 
developed, but if, as often happens, it is necessary to 
cook old carrots, remember that both their flavour and 
their colour are improved if they are not cut in any way 
till cooked. Scrape them and cook them, then trim, 
slice, and otherwise prepare them. Young carrots 
take from twenty to thirty minutes to cook, according 
to age and size ; old carrots will take at least an hour's 
cooking; whilst large and very old ones, towards 
the end of their season, may take quite two hours. 
Carrots need attention, for if overboiled they lose 
flavour, still they must be cooked till tender. Old 
carrots when they must be used for an entree^ should 
be cooked whole, then sliced, quartered, or trimmed 
when tender, and carefully re-heated in sauce or stock 
to taste. 

d la maitre d' hotel. — Choose your carrots 

as much of a size as possible, wash and wipe them 
well, then parboil them for ten minutes in fast boiling 
water. Now drain them, trim and halve them if 
necessary, and toss them over the fire with 1 or 2oz. 
of butter, white pepper, salt, a pinch of caster sugar, 
some finely minced parsley, and a good squeeze of 
lemon juice. Let them cook thus for fifteen to twenty 
minutes, according to size, until tender, then serve

the liquor is all absorbed and the carrots are glazed 
with the butter. 

Carrot salad, — ^This may be a very simple or a 
very ornate dish as you please, but the method is the 
same. Slice some cold cooked carrots evenly, and 
arrange them neatly with capers, minced parsley, 
and chives, fillets of anchovy, hard-boiled and quar- 
tered eggs, stoned or farced olives, &c., &c., to taste. 
If young carrots are used, they should be braized, 
and mixed with plovers' eggs, stoned oHves farced 
with savoury anchovy cream, cubes of foie gras, 
fines herbes, and mayonnaise ; plain vinaigrette being 
used for the common version.

these moulds make a very nice garnish for roast or 
stewed meat. 

Carrot puree, — Boil some large well-coloured 
carrots till quite cooked (this will take quite one to 
two hours, according to their age and size) ; then 
drain and rinse them in cold water ; melt loz. of butter, 
and work into it smoothly a dessertspoonful of fine 
dry flour, and then the carrot pulp, with a dash of 
white pepper, and a dust of caster sugar, and stir it 
altogether over the fire till the puree is quite smooth 
and of a nice consistency, according to the purpose 
for which you require it. A little more butter or a 
spoonful or so of cream is an improvement to this. 

Catdiftower (choufleur), — ^Trim these neatly, remov- 
ing an unnecessary leaves, cut the stalk across to 
make it stand level, then cut it across and across, 
without, however, cutting through to the flower. 
Now place it head down in a basin of acidulated and 
salted cold water, and let it soak for an hour or two, 
to remove any insects. To cook it. plunge it again 
head downwards (this is to keep the flower white) 
in plenty of boiling salted water, to which you have 
added a little carter sugar (a teaspoonful to the gallon 
ol water is about right;, and let it boil sharply un- 
eovered. Watch it carefully whilst oooloDe, for if

overdone it' is utterly spoilt. (Never use a tinned 
pan to coolc cauliflowers in.) When cooked drain 
well, and seWe in a hot vegetable dish, either plain 
or with any sauce to taste (siich as bechamel, brown 
butter, cream, curry, estragon, hollandaise, Morny, 
tomato, white sauce, &c.), round, but not over it t 
{Estragon sauce is plain melted butter or white saucej 
to which have been added a spoonful of finely minced 
fresh tarragon, a drop or two of tarragon vinegar, 
and a small piece of butter quite at the last.) 

In France, the sauce, which is usually kept somewhat 
thick for this purpose, is poured first into the dish, 
the cauliflower being carefully stood up in the middle 
of it. When cauliflowers are small or ill-grown, cook 
them as above, then arrange them head down in a 
pudding basin of suitable size (previously scalded 
out with boiling water), arranging the florets neatly, 
press them gently into shape, then lay the dish on 
top of the basin, reverse the latter quickly, and remove 
it ; the cauliflower should turn out in a compact 
tidy head. When served thus the sauce sent up with 
it may be poured over as well as round it, for cauli- 
flowers needing such treatment are seldom of a good 
colour. One of the nicest sauces for these cauli- 
flowers is Allemande, made thus : Take IJoz. of white 
roux, or stir together over the fire till quite smooth 
IJoz. fresh butter and a spoonful of fine flour, then 
moisten this with half a pint of milk or white 
Stock (or half and half), add a drop or two of essence 
of mushroom, and stir it over the fire till it thickens and 
is perfectly smooth; now lift it off the fire, add a 
tjnv joat of butter broken itp small, and, when it is

pretty well dissolved, stir in the yolk of an egg pre- 
viously beaten up with the strained juice of a lemon, 
and use. It must be remembered that broccoli 
can be served by any recipe given for cauliflower. 

Cauliflowers lend themselves particularly well 
to reheating, though of course a freshly cooked 
vegetable may be used. The following are some 
ways of treating cooked cauUflower : — 

Cauliflower au four. — ^Break up the cold cauUflower 
into little sprays, and arrange them neatly in a well- 
buttered dish ; beat up together half a gill of dissolved 
butter, three-quarters of a gill of new milk or cream, 
and a teacupful of freshly grated and sieved white 
breadcrumbs, season with pepper and salt, add in a 
well-beaten whole egg, pour this all over the cauli- 
flower, being careful to have it well covered, and 
bake till nicely browned. A more savoury version 
of this is — 

au gratin. — For this arrange the veget- 
able (either freshly cooked or left from a previous 
meal) on a buttered fireproof china dish, pour over 
it sufficient liquefied butter to moisten it nicely, dust 
it lightly with freshly ground black pepper and 
some grated Parmesan cheese ; have ready equal 
parts of freshly grated and sieved white breadcrumbs 
and grated Parmesan, and strew this Uberally over 
the dish, moistening it well with liquefied butter, 
repeating this strewing, if necessary, to cover the 
cauliflower well, and bake till browned. 

fritters (choufleur a la VUleroi), — Break 

a not too cooked cauliflower up into tiny sprays, 
dip these into any rich and very tbiek iw\s^* ^a^siRfc^ 



48 VEGETABLES. 

and leave them till this is fairly set on them ; now 
dip them in frying batter till well coated, and fry 
a golden brown in plenty of hot fat, then drain well, 
dust with fine salt and coralline pepper, and serve 
piled up on a napkin. A variant of this dish (known 
as choufleur en beignets) consists in marinading the 
cold and broken-up vegetable for an hour or so in 
a little tarragon vinegar, with whole peppercorns 
and cloves, then draining it lightly, dipping it into 
the batter, and finishing off as before. For the 
batter put into a basin 2oz. fine flour, the yolk of an 
egg, a dessertspoonful of salad oil, and a good half 
gill of cold water ; mix it all till quite smooth, then 
let it rest for a little. When wanted for use add the 
well-beaten white of the egg, mixing it in very Ughdy 
and quickly, and use. 

CauLiftower souffle, — Cut up a nice cooked cauUflower 
into neat sprays, and put a layer of these in a well- 
buttered souffle dish, covering this again with a layer 
of sliced raw tomato, and repeat these layers till the 
cauliflower is used up ; then cover it with a souffle 
mixture, dust the top with some browned bread- 
crumbs« and some tiny morsels of butter, and bake 
in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. For the 
souffle mixture, stir together over the fire 2oz. butter 
and l^oz. fine flour, moistening this with the yolks 
of two smull eggs, and a short half pint of milkf 
season with a dust of coralline pepper and a pinch of 
salt, and when it boils stir in 3oz. of grated Parmesan 
cheese, and at the last the whites of three eggs pre- 
viously whipped to a stiff froth with a pinch of salt. 
Cold cooked cauliflower can of course be warmed

up in any of the sauces given above for fresh cooked 
vegetables, and is also excellent in salad, either by 
itself or mixed with other things. It is equally good 
with a plain vinaigrette sauce or with mayonnaise, 
tomato mayonnaise being especially good. 

Celeriac (celSri-rave), also known as turnip-rooted 
celery, is a vegetable that is only slowly recovering 
its former popularity. It is a great favourite abroad, 
in Germany especially. To cook it, peel the roots 
(which are the parts eaten), either quarter or slice 
them, and boil in plenty of salted and acidulated 
boiling water till tender ; then drain, and serve with 
any sauce to taste. In Germany, especially if to be 
iised en salade, a very favourite way, the celeriac is 
cooked in weak stock instead of water. If parboiled 
as above, and finished oif by stewing in any rich 
sauce to taste, it is particularly good, as it is also as a 
pur^e, when it makes an excellent garnish for cutlets, 
poultry, duck, &c. Its great advantage is that it 
is at its best when celery is unprocurable, and can 
be stored in the autumn like any other root vegetable. 

Celery (celeri). — ^Besides being excellent raw, celery 
makes a particularly good vegetable entremet, as 
palatable as it is hygienic. It is considered most 
wholesome for rheumatic persons. For most purposes 
celery is first cooked thus : Trim the roots, and cut 
the heads neatly to the same length, say six inches, 
well wash them, and tie them up in neat bundles 
with string or tape; now put them in a pan with 
an onion, a blade of mace, some whole peppers, salt, 
and enough boiling water to cover them generously ; 
bring this all to the boil, and*\el *\t eoo^ V'cyc ^^nS^

twenty-five minutes. You then drain it, place it 
on a hot dish, and serve with good allemande, Ix^chamel, 
cream, Parmesan (a rich white sauce, made with 
loz. of butter, a dessertspoonful of flour, half a pint 
of the liquor in which the celery was cooked, a spoonful 
of grated Parmesan cheese, and a drop or two of 
lemon juice ; stir over the fire till it is thick, and 
smooth and use), espagnole, or any sauce to taste, 
of course varying the name of the dish according 
to the sauce used. A little lemon juice should always 
be added to the water in which celery is cooked, as 
this preserves its colour. Some cooks also consider 
it best to blanch the celery first by plunging the 
heads of celery, when trimmed, &c., into fast boiling 
water, and letting them cook for ten minutes, after 
which they are carefully drained, wiped, and put 
on in either brown or white stock, milk, or milk 
and water to cover them ; this is gently brought to 
the boil again, then drawn to the side of the stove, 
and kept at simmering point till the celery is tender, 
which will take from one and a half to two hours. 
It can then be drained, and served very hot, with a 
few drops of lemon squeezed over it, and a small 
pat of butter on each head, or it can be served with 
any sauce recommended for asparagus. If the 
liquor in which the celery was cooked is freed from 
fat, slightly thickened and served with the vegetable, 
the dish is known as celeri au jus. When stewed 
thus, it may be served with marrow precisely 
as described for cordons au moelle. Any cold celery 
left over can be served au gratin, or cut into neat 
pieces, dipped in good batter, ^and fried a golden 



VEGETABLES. 51 

brown in plenty of boiling fat, then drained well, 
and served hot, dusted with coralline pepper. Cold 
celery is also excellent if gently re-heated in good 
curry sauce. If stewed celery when tender is rubbed 
through a hair sieve, then thickened with a little 
butter and flouri moistening it with either a 8jxx>nful 
or two of cream or of brown gravy (according to 
the colour you wish it to be), it makes an extremely 
nice garnish for poultry, game, &c. Remember 
that for cooking purposes the outside leaves, if stewed 
gently, are quite as good as the heart, which should 
be reserved for use raw as salad. Celery is excellent 
as a salad with a French or a mayonnaise dressing, 
as preferred, either alone, or preferably mixe^l with 
other vegetables, such as sliced tomatoes, blanched 
walnuts, cold sUced (waxy) potatoes, spring onions,^ 
&c. To be eaten in perfection the mayonnaise should 
be stood on ice till all but frozen, and the dish should 
be set in another filled with crushed ice. 

Chervil (cerfeuU). — ^This pretty little plant is mostly 
used for decorative purposes, and for flavouring 
sauces, &c. It lasts, however, so short a time in its 
fresh state that it is best to treat it like parsley, i.e.y 
dry, powder, and bottle it. 

Chestnuts {marrons). — ^These are but little used 
in this country save as stuffing for turkeys, &c., or 
as marrons glaces, the well-known sweetmeat. Yet 
they may be prepared in various ways, and make 
a most excellent vegetable.

remove the skins, turn them on to a napkin on a 
tot dish, and serve at once with butter, salt, and 
^hite pepper, and, if liked, a little claret. Or, remove 
the outer skin, and blanch them as you do almonds, 
in boiling water, till you can remove the inner skin 
•easily, throwing each as done into a basin of salted 
«Lnd acidulated cold water. Now stir together smoothly 
^oz. of flour and loz. of fresh butter, moistening 
this, when blended, with half a pint of rich well- 
flavoured stock ; when this boils up season it with 
salt and pepper, lay in the chestnuts, let the sauce 
just reboil, then draw it to the side of the stove, and 
allow it to simmer steadily till the nuts are perfectly 
tender but unbroken. These are excellent as an 
accompaniment to roast meat or poultry. 

Chestnut puree is cooked as above, the nuts being 
rubbed through the sieve as soon as they are tender, 
then finished off with a pat of butter, a dust of caster 
sugar, a grate of nutmeg, and sufficient espagnole 
or good brown sauce to bring them to the right 
consistency, if to be used hot. If for use with a 
chaufroix, allow the puree to get cold, then mix 
into it lightly and quickly two or three spoonfuls 
of stiffly-whipped cream. 

stuffing. — For an average good turkey, 

cut the tops from 2 to 31b. of chestnuts, and bake 
them for fifteen minutes ; now peel off the skins, and 
lay the nuts in a pan with just enough second stock 
to cover them, bring this to the boil, then draw the 
pan to the side, and only allow them to simmer till

sugar, and a dust of coraUine pepper, and insert as 
much as you require into the body of the bird, sending 
the rest to table in a Tegetable dish. 

Chestnuts with truffles. — Toss 12 to 16oz. of fat 
bacon (cut into dice, with two minced shallots) over 
the fire till lightly coloured, then add twenty to thirty 
cooked chestnuts, also cut into dice, and 4oz. of 
truffles, previously roughly minced ; season to taste 
with freshly ground black pepper, salt, and a little 
powdered spice and herbs. Stir this altogether over 
the fire for a few minutes, then use. 

Chicory (Chicoree). — See Endive. 

Chives {Cibaule, cihoulette, or civettes). — These 
are a smaU kind of onion, differing, however, from 
the ordinary sort by the fact that the leaves and not 
the bulbs are used They are greatly used for flavour- 
ing and seasoning, and, properly speaking, should 
always form a part of any d'uxelle fourniture or 
fines herbes gamisk They should, when possible, 
be used directly they are gathered, as the flavour 
passes off very quickly, and in consequence they 
are not often seen in greengrocers* shops. Their 
fiavour is far more delicate than that of the onion 
proper, and is almost indispensable for the perfect 
success (rf certain dish^ such as cirets de luvre, kc^

cabbage, sprouts, or greens of any kinds, and pota- 
toes, rub them all through a sieve, mixing them well 
as you do so, work in 1 or 2oz. of butter (or clarified 
dripping), pepper and salt, and one whole egg. Press 
this mixture tightly into a well-buttered small pudding 
basin, and bake from thirty to forty minutes in a 
hot oven. Serve very hot, alone, or as a garnish 
for fried boiled salt beef. 

Corn, Indian (Mais). — ^This vegetabJe, though very 
popular — both fresh and dried — ^abroad, in the United 
States especially, has only of late years come into 
favour in this country ; though for several years 
preparations of it have been used under other names 
freely. Moreover, few people in this country appear 
to know that the polenta they enjoy served in various 
ways in Italy, is nothing more nor less than porridge 
made from Indian cornmeal. This is exceedingly 
good, and when vegetables are scarce makes a very 
appetising accompaniment to roast meat. For this 
purpose prepare a porridge exactly as if using oatmeal, 
sifting the meal into the boiling salted water, with 
one hand as you stir it with the other, keeping up 
• the stirring till the polenta is cooked. You will find 
a small handful of meal to the pint of water ample. 
If prepared thus it makes by no means despicable 
porridge if eaten with salt and milk, or sugar or 
golden syrup. But for other purposes, add to it 
whilst cooking a good pat of butter, and sprinkle 
in grated cheese alternately with the meal, till the 
mixture is thick. Now turn it out, and leave it till 
cold, then slice it, and cut the slices into diamonds or 
squares, fry in boiling fat or oil till lightly coloured,

and serve with mushroom or tomato puree. This 
polenta makes a rerj saroury dish if prepared as 
aboTe, left till cold, then lifted in spoonfuls, these 
being arranged neatly in a well-buttered piedish, 
liberally sprinkled with bits of butter, grated cheese, 
and coralline pepper, and baked till of a pretty golden 
brown. This is known as Gnocchi alia Napolitana. 
If preferred, tomato puree or any good sauce or gravy 
may be used instead of the cheese, &c. If, however, 
the green com in the ear be available, the following 
are some of the ways in which it may be utilised : 

Corn^ Indian, to bail. — Choose short, thick ears, and 
strip of! all but the inner layer of husk, turning this 
back to remove the " silk " from the com and any 
bad grains ; then fold it back, tie it up at the top, 
put it in a large pan half full of boiling water, and 
boil steadily for fifteen to twenty minutes, according 
to the size of the ear ; now remove the strings, and 
serve very hot, with a boat of melted butter, Holland- 
aise sauce, or oiled butter, as you please. Or, remove 
the husks and silk from six young corn cobs, lay them 
in a pan with sufficient water to cover them, add a 
gill of milk, ^oz. of butter, and a small handful of 
salt, and cook for twenty minutes. Serve very hot 
in a napkin. N.B. — ^This last is the best way of 
cooking canned corn. 

grated, — Boil some corn by the first 

recipe, then grate ofiE all the grains and heat over 
the fire with a little salt, white pepper, butter, and a 
spoonful or so of cream, and serve very hot. 

fritters, — ^Remove the grains from some 

cold boiled corn, mix these with good frying batter.

drop the mixture by spoonfuls into hot fat, and fry 
to a golden brown. Drain, and serve dusted with 
fine salt and coralline pepper. 

Corn, Indiarty roasted. — Husk and silk the cobs as 
before, brush them over with butter, season them 
with salt and pepper, and lay them in a baking tin 
in front of and close to a clear hot fire ; let them 
toast till they are nicely browned, turning them 
now and again to ensure their colouring evenly, and 
serve very hot. 

and tomatoes. — Peel and cut up small 

a pound of tomatoes, put them into a pan with butter, 
salt, and pepper, and let them all simmer gently at 
the back of the range till they are reduced to two- 
thirds of their original bulk. Have ready six ears of 
corn previously husked, silked, and cooked for fifteen 
minutes in salted; water ; cut the grains from the cob, 
stir the former in among the tomatoes, and serve hot. 

succotash. — Have readv half a breakfast- 

cupful of grated or canned corn and the same of 
cooked beans. (If French or string beans are chosen, 
cook in just enough salted water to cover them ; 
if Lima or butter beans are used, cook till perfectly 
tender; whilst if dried beans are preferred, they must 
be soaked for twenty-four hours and then cooked 
as usual.) Mix the corn and the beans, season to 
taste with salt and pepper, add just enough milk to 
moisten it all, stir in a teaspoonful of flour and a 
full tablespoonful of butter, let it just boil up well, 
then serve. If over-cooked the corn toughens.

Corn salad {Mdche, or doucette), — ^This plant, also 
known as ** lamb's lettuce,'* is most useful by itself 
in the early spring, when real lettuces are not ready, 
or it is an excellent addition to almost any other 
salad, lettuce especially. It requires thorough washing 
before using. 

Cucumber (Concombre). — ^This is more generally 
brought to table raw, as a salad, but it makes a very 
appetising vegetable entremet if cooked.

from a good (but not too large) cucumber, halve it 
lengthways, remove the seeds, and cut it into neat 
pieces ; now put it on in plenty of boiUng salted water, 
let it reboil, then simmer gently for five minutes ; 
after which you drain it dry, softly pressing it in a 
clean cloth to remove superfluous water ; now place 
the pieces in a clean pan with a dust of salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and a short half pint of good gravy, and 
let them simmer very gently till tender, but not 
broken. It will take about twenty minutes altogether. 
These are called C. au jus. If after parboiling them 
as above, you place them, when drained, into a pan 
with a good pat of fresh butter, some minced parsley, 
white pepper, salt, and lemon juice, and let them 
stew very gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, they 
are known as C. a la maitre d^hoteL Or, when

July, though for cooking purposes the leaves may 
be used later, whilst the roots (which are a very fair 
substitute for salsify) are in season from the end 
of June until October. For use as salad the roots 
and the withered or imperfect leaves should be cut 
away, the rest being carefully washed in two or three 
waters to get rid of the sand which clings to them, 
then blanch, drain, and dry them well, and mix them 
with a French salad dressing. They also make an 
excellent salad a la Comtoise, i.e., after washing and 
drying them, lay them in the bowl, and pour to them 
1 or 2oz. of fat bacon — ^previously cut into dice, and 
fried for four or five minutes till of a golden colour — 
then pour a tablespoonful of vinegar for each ounce 
of bacon into the frying pan, let it just heat up, pour 
it all over the salad, mixing it all well, and serve. 
These salades d la Comtoise, made with many sorts 
of vegetables, are very popular in France. 

Dandelion, stewed. — ^Pick the leaves well over, wash 
them in two waters, and then throw them into cold 
water to steep for one or two hours ; now drain them 
well, and put them into a pan of boiling salted water, 
and boil them for twenty to thirty minutes till cooked. 
They are then lifted out in a strainer, plunged for 
a minute in cold water, then gently pressed with 
the hands till all possible moisture is extracted, and 
chopped fine. Now stir in a pan an ounce of butter 
or good clarified dripping, with a dessertspoonful 
of flour, moisten with a full tablespoonful of strong 
gravy or stock, seasoning it with pepper and salt, 
and stir it all together till blended, when you lay in 
the chopped dandelion, and stir it with a wooden

spoon till it is thoroughly mixed and quite hot (this 
takes from eight to ten minutes), stir in just at the 
last a spoonful of rich brown sauce or thick cream, 
ajB you please, turn it out on a hot dish, and serve 
garnished with croutons of fried bread or fUwrons 
of cheese pastry. Always use plenty of water in 
blanching this vegetable, as this obviates the extreme 
bitterness sometimes noticed in the leaves, especially 
if overgrown. Dandelion should always be gathered 
early in the morning, for the sun toughens the leaves. 

The roots require to be well scraped, and boiled 
in acidulated salted water till they are firm but 
thoroughly cooked, when they may be finished off 
in any of the ways given for celery or salsify. They 
are specially good as fritters, or au grali/a.

Endue (Chicoree or EscaroUy-^Ahroad several 
kinds of this plant are used both for salad and cooking, 
but the kinds best known in this country are the 
broad-leaved or Batavian endive (e$ca/role), the curled 
endive (ehicorf'e), and the wild endive, or succory, 
aa it is sometimes called (barbe de eajmcin). For 
saJad, endive is well picked over and washed, and 
served by itself or with other salad herbs, with a 
French salad dressing. Abroad a *' chapon '* (ue,^

blanched, and then finished off in butter with lemon 
juice, cream, or any rich sauce or gravy, as you please 
It takes a little longer both to blanch and to cook 
than dandelion. 

Fennel (FenauU). — An indigenous plant, formerly 
more used than in the present day. It is nowadays 
chiefly used for garnishing various kinds of fish, 
mackerel, salmon, &c., or is minced and served with 
the melted butter sauce sent to table with these fish. 
The fennel should be blanched, well dried, and finely 
minced before it is added to the sauce. Few people 
seem to know that if mackerel, before broiling, are 
wrapped in fennel, and thus laid on the grid, the 
flavour of the fish is greatly enhanced. Fennel seeds 
are also used abroad in the preparation of a liqueur 
known as fenouUlette. 

Garlic (Ail). — ^This is far more popular abroad 
than it is, or is likely to be, in this country. At the 
same time, if judiciously used, it often greatly enhances 
the flavour of many dishes. For instance, a peeled 
clove of garlic inserted in the knuckle end of a leg 
of mutton before roasting will give a peculiar taste 
much appreciated by connoisseurs, though the less 
cultivated gourmet would probably not realise the 
origin of the strange aroma. The clove should of 
course be removed before serving. The best way to 
use garlic for our taste is either as garlic vinegar or 
v)in£. The preparation is the same for both. Put 
half a dozen peeled cloves into a wide-necked bottle 
cover generously with either good vinegar or sherry 
{or Marsala), cork it down closely, shake it now and

somewhat on the age and the kind of greens, but 
fifteen to twenty minutes is a fair average. Greens 
are also excellent if cooked in any way advised for 
spinach, especially au gratin. 

Herbs. — Of these there are a great variety, far 
more being in use formerly than are now acknow- 
ledged. It is a great pity the use of these is neglected, 
as by them were obtained the flavours we all admire 
in foreign cookery, and try to reproduce by the lavish 
use of cruet sauces of various kinds, which, however, 
never give the same delicate aroma or savour as the 
natural herbs do. The herbs in most frequent use 
are basil (excellent in connection with tomatoes in any 
shape), chervil, chives, cress, fennel, marjoram, 
mint, sage, savoury, thyme, and tarragon. To 
these may be added bay leaves and horseradish, 
though these are scarcely herbs. Of course herbs 
are best used fresh, but as this is impossible all the 
year round, the best plan is to pick them when in 
perfection, and dry them slowly on sheets of white 
paper, either in the sun or in very gentle heat, and 
then powder them finely, putting each sort up sepa- 
rately in wide-mouthed, closely-stoppered bottles, 
each labelled with the name of the particular herb. 
This is both a thriftier and cleaner way of saving 
them than the old-fashioned method of hanging 
them in bundles from the kitchen ceiling A tea- 
spoonful of dried herbs equals a dessertspoonful of 
fresh ones, measured after they are minced. 

M, Gouffe recommends the preparation of a special 
herb mixture for use in stuffings, stews, &c., and the 
advice of so noted a chef is not to be despised. '* Pound

Hops (Houblons). — ^The tops or tender young 
shoots of these were formerly much used as a vegetable, 
being generally cooked like asparagus, ue., tied up 
into neat bundles, boiled for twenty minute in water, 
to which a little stock had been added, and RorvcMl 
with any sauce to taste. Though not purchnsnhln 
in shops, hops are easily procured in tb^ \\vv^ ^vw\x^\>§x

where tliese young shoots are trimmed off and thrown 
away. The shoots should be used before the heads 
are fully developed. Cold cooked hops make a deli- 
cious salad if left on ice, and then served with a French 
or mayonnaise dressing. 

Hops, fried, — Scrape the shoots a little, well 
wash, and three-parts boil them in acidulated salted 
water, then drain, sprinkle with salt, and leave till 
perfectly cold. Then flour them, dip in beaten egg 
and fresh breadcrumbs, and fry a golden brown 
in boiling fat. Serve plain, sprinkled with salt, 
or with any sauce to taste, handed separately. 

Horseradish (Raifort). — This is chiefly used as a 
condiment or a garnish, but is seldom if ever cooked. 
For garnish choose a young tender root, scrub it 
well, and scrape it down finely into tiny shavings. 
It is also added to various sauces as described else- 
where. It may be kept fresh for a considerable 
time by burying it in sand in a cool place. Or, again, 
it may be sliced, and these slices dried very slowly 
in a slack oven, or before the fire, till fit to pound, 
after which the result is sifted, bottled, and labelled, 
as mentioned for dried herbs. Accidents have 
happened before now from inexperienced cooks 
mistaking monk's-hood or aconite root for horse- 
radish with deadly effect, therefore the former should 
never be allowed to grow anywhere near the latter. 
Cooks should also know that there is a marked diffe- 
rence usually in the roots, the aconite being cone- 
shaped, tapering rapidly to a point, whereas the 
horseradish root is like a cylinder, long and of even 
size for a cr^nsiderable part of its length.

cutting the'green off close to the white, and trinuning 
them neatly. Tie them up into small bundles, and 
blanch them in salted water, draining this off, and 
finishing their cooking in more absolutely boiling 
acidulated iind salted water, drain them well, and 
serve with melted or oUed butter, or any white sauce 
handed separately. They may also, after blanching, 
be finished off either in milk or stock, to which you 
add a bouquet, but be careful to keep them as white 
as possible, as this is a great point about leeks. They 
may also, when blanched, be cut up and put in a sauce- 
pan with a large pat of butter, a dust of flour, pepper 
and 3alt to taste, and just sufficient milk or stock 
to moisten them, and allowed to simmer till done. 
Work into them just as you serve them either a 
spoonful or two of rich cream, or the yolk of an egg 
beaten up with the juice of a lemon. 

Leeks, stewed. — ^Trim and boil the leeks in acidu- 
lated salted water till three-parts cooked, then place 
them in a pan with a good pat of butter, half a pint 
of cream or new milk, and a teaspoonful each of 
caster sugar and flour strewed over all. Stir it over 
the flre till the sauce is reduced and thickened, adding 
just at the last the yolks of one or two eggs mixed 
with a spoonful or so of cream, and serve on a hot 
vegetable dish. If after boiUng till tender, the leeks 
are sieved, finished off with the butter, cream, &c., 
as above, and served with fried croutons, or cheese 
pastry fleurons, they make an extremely nice puree. 

Gold cooked leeks are also very good if finished off 
au gratin, or served with a French oil and vinegar 
salad dressing ; whil&t. t\i^ ioUowing makes an 



VEGETABLES. (>$» 

extremely pretty fancy salad: Cut the leeks into 
neat^ even pieces; dip a laige tomato for a minute 
into boifiiig water, remove the peel, and when it is 
cold and firm, slice it. Break up a well-washed 
lettuce into small pieces, arrange these on a glass dish, 
then lay on it the sHced tomato and the leeks alter- 
nately, season with a vinaigrette, or mayonnaise 
sauce, Sjprinkle with minced tarragon and chives, 
and serve garnished with filleted anchovies, picked 
shrimps, or prawns, oUves, &c., as you please. Small 
tomatoes seeded and the flesh well pressed back with 
a spoon, then filled with the prawns, &c., form a very 
pretty garnish for this dish. Leeks are specially 
good in soups, as they impart a richness and a velvety 
substance given by no other vegetable ; whilst if three 
parts cooked in boiling salted water, dried, and cut 
into julienne strips, and finished ofE in either milk 
or stock, with a dust of caster sugar, they make a 
very effective garnish. 

Lentils {LsntiUes,) — ^Lentils do not generally meet 
with the appreciation their nutritious and palatable 
qualities deserve, though many people will admit the 
value of the well-known Bevalenta Arabica, which 
is, did they but know it, simply a preparation of 
lentil flour mixed with a certain proportion of fine 
barley or wheat flour. 

a la maitre d'hotel, — ^Well wash a pint of 

lentils in plenty of cold water, then put them on in 
a pan of cold water with an onion stuck with three 
or four cloves, a blade of mace, and a bayleaf, and 
boil them till tender, adding a little more cold water 
occasionally as that in the pan evaporates; Wheno^vtA

tender, but not mashed, drain them from the water, 
stir to them 2oz. of butter, a teaspoonful of minced 
parsley, pepper and salt to taste, and a good squeeze 
of lemon juice, let it all reheat, and serve. Or, when 
the lentils are tender, stir to them just as they are to 
be served, the yolk of an egg beaten up with a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice, and serve with white sauce 
round the pile. Lentils are also very good if a nice piece 
of bacon be boiled with them, and when ready, served 
with the lentils finished off a la maitre d/hotd round it. 
Lentils au lard. — Cut an onion into dice, and fry 
it a pale golden brown in butter, then add twice 
as much fat bacon cut to match, and when this is 
cooked mix in a pint of lentils boiled as above, moisten 
it all with a Uttlef stock, season to taste with pepper, 
and a very Kttle salt, with a spoonful of minced parsley, 
and let it simmer very gently till wanted, moistening 
it with a Kttle more stock if necessary. Variations 
of this are produced by using good roast meat gravy, 
tomato, or brown onion sauce (bretonne) instead 
of the stock. Lentils also make an excellent puree 
if when boiled tender they are rubbed through a 
sieve, and then reheated with butter and a little 
stock till of the required consistency, when a little 
minced parsley and a squeeze of lemon juice are added 
just at the last. Prepared thus they are an excellent 
accompaniment to broiled or stewed game, cutlets, &Ci 
The lentil puree makes also a very nice pudding on 
the lines of a peas pudding. The nicest lentils are 
the Egyptian, known in France as lentilles a la reine. 
Lastly there are :

be cooked by any method recommended for haricots. 

LeUuee, — Of this plant there are two kinds, tlie 

cabbage lettuce (laitiie) and the Cos lettuce (romaiiie) : 

the former deriving its name from its cabbage-like 

shape, the second is said to come from the island of 

Cos, whence it is believed to be derived, but there 

is considerable doubt on the subject. In this country 

the lettuce is chiefly eaten raw, but it also makes 

an extremely appetising vegetable entremet if nicely 

prepared, whilst the stalks used formerly to he 

greatly appreciated served Hke asparagus.

Lettuce a la creme, — ^Well wash three or four 
good-fiized cabbage lettuces, trim them, and remove all 
faded or discoloured leaves, and blanch them for eight 
or ten minutes in fast boiling water ; then rinse in cold 
water, dry them well, and cut them in quarters or 
eight parts, according to size ; now lay them in a 
clean pan with 2oz. of butter, a dust each of white 
pepper and salt, and a tiny pinch of caster sugar; 
let this all simmer together very gently at the side 
of the stove for two to three hours, stirring it pretty 
often with a delicately clean wooden spoon. When 
they are quite tender stir in the yolks of two eggs 
beaten up with rather more than half a gill of good 
cream or new milk, and when this is quite hot (mind 
it does not boil) serve on a hot dish, garnished with 
flewrons of puff paste. Cos lettuce may be cooked 
in the same way, but take rather less time. 

stewed. — ^Trim, blanch, rinse, and dry 

them as before, put either some slices of fat bacon 
or 2oz. of well-clarified dripping in a pan, lay the 
lettuces (halved) on this with an onion, and some 
sprays of parsley, and pour in sufficient unskimmed 
stock to cover it all, lay a buttered paper on top, 
and simmer it for two hours till the hquor is reduced 
to a glaze ; then lift out the lettuces on to a hot dish, 
skim all of the liquid very carefully, add it to 
some nice brown sauce, pour this over them, and 
serve. If liked, after blanching and drying the 
lettuces, some nice forcemeat of any kind may be 
introduced between the leaves, the whole tied neatly 
into shape, and finished off as in the preceding recipe. 
Lettuces are nice if minced rather finely after blanching

Mint {M&dhe). — ^This herb \& uised b^ih fitrtii

purposes being the spear mint. A spray of miiit 
is put with young green peas wlien they are to Ije 
boiled, and also by some people with new potat<xrb ; 
but, as a rule, fresh mint is chiefly used for 'laiiU

then mix with it a gill of good vinegar, lialf a gill 
of cold water, and l^oz. of caster sugar, let it stand

success of this sauce depends on the fineness with 
which the mint is minced, and the allowing it to stand 
for at least two hours before using it. 

Morels (Morilles). — ^A kind of spongy-looking 
mushroom, which grows in some parts of England, 
but is more often procured in a dried condition from 
the ItaUan warehouses. It is chiefly used for flavour- 
ing sauces, but can be served fresh by any recipe

given for mushrooms. As, however, the flavour 
of the morel is far more deUcate than that of the 
mushroom, seasoning must be carefully used. 

Mushroom {Cepes, champignons, &c.) — Of these 
there are a large variety, far more kinds being eaten 
abroad than in Great Britain, where considerable 
suspicion attaches to all but the best known varieties. 
The worst is that there is no infaUible method of 
ascertaining which kinds are wholesome, and if not 
perfectly wholesome, mushrooms are distinctly 
poisonous. In France very strict supervision is exer- 
cised over the mushrooms sent to market, so that 
accidents are comparatively rare. French cooks 
assert that if a silver spoon be placed in the pot or pan 
in which the mushrooms are cooking, if they are 
unwholesome the silver will discolour, in which case 
they throw the fimgus away. But it must be borne 
in mind that however good mushrooms are when 
fresh, they become unwholesome, if not actually 
poisonous, when stal^, and in no foreign market would 
the sale of such black-fleshed fungi as may frequently 
be seen in our English greengrocers' shops be 
permitted. It is best, therefore, to be somewhat 
particular as to the origin and the freshness of the 
mushrooms we use. It may also be well to add the 
directions constantly given in French cookery books, 
and also by the Prefecture de la Police in Paris, for 
the treatment of persons poisoned by mushrooms. 
After such poisoning, neither brandy, ether, sal 
volatile, vinegar, nor water should be given; oil, 
butter, and milk are alike useless ; an emetic must be 
taken at once, with a sharp aperient, and the doctor

the mushrooms, and pour the rest of the sauce. &c., 
round it. 

Mushrooms, baked, — ^For this use the flaps; wash, peel, 
and remove the steins, then place in a baking dish, 
seasoning them with pepper, salt, and a very little 
pounded mace, if liked, lay small pieces of butter on 
the top, and bake from twenty to twenty-five minutes, 
according to size ; then serve on the dish they were 
cooked in. with a tiny pat of maitre d'hotel butter 
on each, and a light dust of coralline pepper. 

braised. — Choose the mushrooms as much 

of a size as possible ; trim and dry them very carefuUy, 
then fry them in a little oil or butter till partly cooked, 
and of a nice brown colour. Now drain them and put 
them in a pan with just enough strong brown stock or 
gravy to keep them from burning, and let them cook 
till done, then lift them out. and reduce the liquor in 
which they are cooked by a sharp boiling, adding to 
it a small piece of glaze or Lemco, and when this is 
all well reduced pour it all aver the mushrooms, 
and serve. This makes an excellent garnish for roast 
or stewed meat ; mushrooms stewed or braised A\ith 
any kind of meat should be taken out when rather 
more than three parts cooked, well brushed with 
dissolved glaze, and set in the oven or in front of the 
fire for a minute, if liked very brown; now glaze 
them a second time, and dry them as before. 

broiled, — For these choose large, even 

sized mushrooms, and marinade them, in a little oil 
or oiled butter, for twenty-five to thirty minutes; 
brush the gridiron over with a little of this oil, and

place the mushrooms on it stem upwards, and broil 
them rather quickly, basting them now and again 
with some of the marinade oil. Mind they do not 
stick to the bars. Serve very hot, dusted with a 
Uttle salt and freshly ground black and coralline pepper. 
Middle sized mushrooms take about twenty minutes 
to cook, but remember that mushrooms, if under- 
cooked, are indigestible, whilst if overcooked they 
waste very much. They can be served plain, or if 
liked with a little clear gravy. 

Mushroom croquettes. — ^Wipe and trim the mushrooms,, 
cut them into dice, and cook them with an ounce of 
butter till soft ; add, whilst the mushrooms are hot,, 
enough fine breadcrumbs to make a sti£Bsh paste,, 
season with salt, pepper, a tiny spray of minced parsley, 
a (dhist of grated nutmeg, and an egg to bind it all ; 
now turn it out, and when cold make it into balls th& 
size of a chestnut, brush these with the white of an 
egg, roll them in fine breadcrumbs, and fry in plenty 
of hot fat till of a golden brown, drain well and serve 
Another version is : Add a well beaten egg apd a few 
breadcrumbs to half a pint of any good rich mushroom 
puree. Now cut some rounds of fat bacon, and lay 
a teaspoonf ul of the mushroom mixture on to half the 
number of rounds of bacon and cover with the rest 
of the bacon, pinching the edges well together to keep 
in the mince ; press them into a good shape, egg them, 
and roll in either breadcrumbs or crushed vermicelli,

with salt, freshly ground black pepper, and cayenne, 
and broil for fifteen to twenty minutes over a clear 
fire, and serve very hot. 

Mushrooms^ dried* — ^Well wash the mushrooms in 
plenty of cold salted water, trim off all decayed and 
defective parts, and spread them on sheets of stout 
paper, on trays or baking sheets, and let them dry 
gradually in the sun, or a slack oven, till all their 
moisture is evaporated, and the miishrooms are quite 
dry. They can then be stored in airtight boxes. Or, 
choose moderate sized mushrooms, and thread them 
on a string, or coarse thread, and hang them up in a 
dry place where there is plenty of air, but no sun; 
when perfectly dry put them into bags, and keep 
them in a dry, airy place, shaking them over 
occasionally. 

: essence, — ^Put 2lb. of well washed and dried 

mushrooms into a pan with two tablespoonfuls of 

lemon juice, and ^z. of salt, cover the pan closely, 

and cook them over the fire for a few minutes ; now 

pour one quart of very rich poultry or white stock on 

to the mushrooms, let them boil together for about 

ten minutes, then strain off through muslin, and when 

the essence is cool bottle off and cork down closely. 

Another way which produces an even stronger essence 

is this : Sprinkle button or flap mushrooms with a 

little fine salt, and let them stand for three hours, 

when you mash them well ; next day strain off the 

liquor that will flow from them, and boil this down till 

reduced to half. This does not keep long, but many 

people prefer it because of its strong natural mushroom 

iflavour. This essence is often mentioned in cookery

a very little salt, whilst others use a third of the bulk 
of breadcrumbs or Parmesan cheese, and season it 
rather strongly with coralline pepper ; others, again, 
substitute parboiled and cut up macaroni for the bread- 
crumbs, and moisten with the mushroom essence 
and some tomato sauce. This last version is especially 
popular in Italy. 

Mushroom powder. — ^Well wash and wipe half a peck 
of large mushrooms (removing all decayed or defective 
parts), cut of! the stalks, and place the mushrooms in 
a pan with Joz. of powdered mace, two spoonfuls of 
groimd pepper, two onions stuck with some cloves, 
a handful of salt, a few allspice, and a Uttle nutm^ if 
liked, 4oz. of butter and no water. Let this stew 
together gently to draw out the juice well, then 
toss it briskly over the fire till the moisture is all 
absorbed ; now spread them on sieves to dry, either 
in the sun, or in a cool oven, till they can be powdered. 
This powder must be bottled in very clean, dry, and 
small bottles, well corked down, and then sealed. A tea- 
spoonful added to any soup or sauce, a minute or two 
before taking it ofE the fire, gives a strong rich flavour. 
They take some time to dry, and may have to be put 
into the oven two or three times before they are fit 
to powder, as they must be done very slowly. 

puree. — ^Well wash lib. of mushrooms, 

dry them carefully and mince them, then put them on 
in a pan with l^z. of fresh butter, and let it all cook 
gently at the side of the stove for six to eight minutes ; 
now miY in two tablespoonfuls of freshly made white 
breadcrumbs, season with salt and coralline pepper, 
stir in a tahlespooniul of good brown sauce, let it just

boil up, then mix in a teaspoonful of finely minced 
parsley, and serve. This is excellent as a garnish 
for cutlets, &c., but a rather more delicate form of 
puree (delicious as the filling of an omelette, &c.) 
is made thus : Well wipe Jib. of good fresh mushrooms, 
peel them, and cut off the stalks, and gently tap the top 
of each mushroom to remove any dust or grit adhering 
to the gills ; put the stalks and trimmings into a pan 
with a little salt and freshly ground pepper and just 
enough water to float them all, bring this aJi to the 
boil, simmer for twelve to fifteen minutes, then 
strain through fine muslin. Now put the trimmed 
mushrooms into a pan with this ketchup, rather more 
than half a gill of new milk, with a pinch of salt and 
a dust of pepper; bring it all well to the boil, then 
only let it simmer for fifteen minutes, and lift off the 
pan, let the mushrooms cool in their own liquor, 
then lift them out, draining them as you do so back 
into the pan, dry them gently, and rub them through 
a sieve, using ^z. of fresh butter to help them through 
Now strain the mushroom liquor to half a pint of 
good sauce (brown or white, according to what you 
want it for), and stir it over the fire till the sauce 
thickens and coats the spoon ; now stir in the puree 
and keep the pan containing this in the bain-marie, 
or in a second larger pot three parts full of boiling 
water, till wanted for use. This makes delicious 
little vegetable entremets if served as darioles de 
champignons a la moeLle. i.e., have ready some little 
batter or pastry cases, fill them with this puree, 
and place on each a good cube of blanched marrow 
prepared as for cardes a la moelle^ 8i^ru\klft ^^^

minced parsley and coralline pepper, and serve very 
hot at once. 

Mushroom soufflr. — Melt together loz. each of fine 
flour and butter, and moisten with rather over a gill 
of cream or new milk, and when this is perfectly 
smooth and thick stir in one by one four well beaten 
egg yolks, and five or six large minced mushrooms. 
Stir in at the last five well beaten egg whites, and 
pour the mixture into a papered souffle case and bake. 
When fresh mushrooms are unobtainable, mince half 
a tin of champignons, and stir these with a teaspoonf ul 
or 80 of the mushroom powder into the panada, and 
finish as before. 

salad. — Wipe and chop the mushrooms 

into dice, and put them on in a pan with a little good 
salad oil and two or three slices of peeled lemon, 
and let this all simmer gently together till the mush- 
rooms are cooked, when you set them aside to cool. 
When perfectly cold lay them in a salad bowl with a 
little minced parsley and chives (or shalot), pepper 
and salt, and toss it all together with a French oil 
and vinegar salad dressing. 

scalloped {au gratin), — Wipe, trim, and 

peel the mushrooms, and place them heads down in a 
well buttered baking dish, dust them pretty thickly 
with freshly made and sieved white breadcrumbs, 
minced parsley and chives, and a little grated Par- 
mesan cheese (or ham if preferred), sprinkle it well 

with Uquefied butter, and bake for ten to fifteen 
minutes.

lay iu some thoroughly cleansed button mushrooms 
(halving or quartering these if necessary), and toss 
them over the fire till cooked, which thev should be 
in ahout ten minutes. A very nice dish of this kind 
may be made with the large flap mushrooms in pre- 
cisely the same way, only let them stew gently for 
eight to ten minutes instead of tossing them, and 
serve in the dish they were cooked in, with a dash of 
lemon juice. Or, peel some large mushrooms, 
remove most of the inside with a silver spoon, and 
broil them. When the outside is brown, put them 
in a stewpan with sufficient second stock to cover 
them, with a spoonful of sherry and a squeeze of 
lemon juice, add to this a little roux, or a teaspoonful 
of flour dissolved with ^oz. of butter, and let it cook 
for a minute or two after it just boils up, then turn 
on to a hot dish, and serve garnished with fried 
croutons, or fleurons of cheese pastry. 

Mushrooms, stuffed. — ^Peel and trim some good fresh 
mushrooms ; mince the peel, trimmings, (fee, and 
two or three whole mushrooms, a small onion, and 
a spray each of parsley and green tarragon. Stir 
this mixture over the fire for two or three minutes 
in a little butter or bacon fat, adding to it (for five 
or six good mushrooms) a tablespoonf ul of fresh white 
breadcrumbs, a good dust of . freshly ground black 
and coralline pepper, salt, and a very little cream or 
new milk. Put the trimmed, whole mushrooms 
heads down in a baking tin, divide the mince between 
them, piling it up well in the cups, and bake for eight 
or ten minutes. Stamp out some rounds of hot 
buttered toast to match che muslwo^wvs^ ^Vt^^ Nkss,'^^

quickly with a little minced parsley, chives, and 
coralline pepper, set them on a hot dish, place a 
mushroom, head down, on each, pour any gravy 
from the mushrooms over them and the toast, and 
serve very hot. 

Mushrooms sur le plat, — For this dish you need two 
soup plates that will stand the fire. Butter one of 
these well, and lay some small mushrooms in this, 
putting a pat of maitre d'hotel butter (the size of a 
good hazel nut) on each, with a very few drops of 
water. Lay a strip of any common paste round the 
edge of this plate, reverse the other plate over it, 
pressing it well down into the paste to keep in aU 
the steam, and bake from twenty to twenty-five 
minutes. When ready remove the top plate and the 
paste, wipe the rim of the under plate, and serve 
the mushrooms at once and very hot. If preferred 
they can, when ready, be lifted on to rounds of hot 
buttered toast on which you have poured the sauce 
in the dish. 

Nasturtiums (also called Indian cress). — It is gener- 
ally used raw in salads and sandwiches, the leaves 
alone being used in the latter case, but both flowers 
and leaves going into the salad ; or pickled, the young 
shoots being particular good as pickles, and the young 
seeds if carefully treated being equal (and to many 
tastes superior) to capers. 

seeds, pickled. — Gather the seeds before 

they are fully ripe, and whilst quite green. Wash them 

well in plenty of cold water, drying them gently 

in a clean, soft cloth, and put them when dry into 

^hss bottles ; for every pint of seeds take a teaspoonful 



VEGETABLES. 85 

of salt, two cloves, half a teaspooaful of finely 
scraped horseradish, and a leaf of green tarragon 
(or failing tliis a Httle tarragon vinegar), add to this 
sufficient good vinegar to cover the seeds thoroughly, 
and pour this mixture into the bottles, corking and 
seaUng them. This is a very easy recipe, but the 
following, though entaiUng a little more trouble, 
is to my mind nicer : For each pint of good vinegar 
allow a teaspoonful of salt, a small tciispoonful of 
peppercorns, and two chillies, and boil these all up 
together, then let it get perfectly cold, when you pour 
it on the seeds bottled as before. Cork and seal well, 
and keep from six weeks to two months before using. 

Nasturtium salad. — Gather the requisite amount of 
flowers, taking with these a few of the young shoots 
and small leaves, mix and place these in a salad bowl, 
and strew them with about a tablespoonful of finely 
minced chervil and some salt ; mix together the 
juice of two lemons and three tablespoonfuls of best 
salad oil till perfectly blended, pour this over the 
nasturtiums, stir them all up well together to dis- 
tribute the dressing evenly, and serve at once. 

vinegar, — Pick sufficient flowers to 

loosely fill a quart bottle, and pour in sufficient good 
malt vinegar to fill it, adding a minced shalot or 
two, a clove, and three or four peppercorns to this 
quantity. Cork down tightly and let it stand for 
two months, then rub it all through a very fine 
sieve, add salt and a little cayenne to taste, and bottle 
off in small bottles, corking and seaUng it down tightly.

the country " nettle broth " is still an inevitable dish 
in the early spring, being held unrivalled as a blood 
purifier. Nettles are at their best in March and April, 
though the tender young shoots may be u^ at 
any time, but never gather them once the flower 
appears on the plant, as then the stalk becomes hard 
and stringy, and the leaves acquire a strong flavour. 
To cook them, wash them well in two or three waters, 
then dry them thoroughly but carefully in a clean 
soft cloth, tie them into neat even bundles, and steam 
them till cooked ; now drain well, remove the string, 
set them tidily on a hot dish, dust Ughtly with salt 
and white pepper, and serve with liquefied butter, 
or beurre fondu in a boat. (For beurre fondu put 
2oz. of fresh butter into a pan Mrith about half a 
teaspoonful of salt, quarter of a teaspoonful of white 
pepper, and a dessertspoonful of lemon juice. Stir 
it all over the fire with a freshly scalded wooden 
spoon till the butter is about half melted, when the 
pan is lifted off the fire and the stirring continued 
till the butter is perfectly dissolved. This gives it 
the creamy taste, never found when the butter is 
completely melted on the fire.) 

Nettles when washed, dried, and minced, may 
be used exactly like spinach. 

Okra, — This West Indian delicacy is the pod of a 
shrub, native in the West Indies, but now also intro- 
duced into America and India, where these pods, 
from their gelatinous nature, are much used in soup 
making, to which they add both body and flavour. 
In this country they have so far only been generally 
known us pickled or canned, in which latter case they 



VEGETABLES. S 



o< 



are mostly used in the preparation of gumbo or okni 
soup. When procurable green, and young, they may 
be cooked in several wajrs, after the first boiling. 
Boiled okras. — ^For this well wash, drain, and trim the 
okras neatly at both ends, then plunge them in fast 
boiling salted water, and let them cook for fifteen 
minutes or so till tender ; now drain and serve them 
with cream, tomato, veloute, or any sauce to taste. 
(Be careful not to choose a too pronounced sauce, 
or the native flavour of the okra will be lost.) Cold 
okras make a capital salad mixed with endive and a 
French salad dressing. They mix well with tomatoes, 
and any left over make an excellent gratin, cooked 
with sliced tomato, freshly ground black pepper, 
salt, Parmesan cheese, and either a good pat of butter, 
or one or two tablespoonfuls of cream. 

Olives (Olives), — These are best known in this 
country bottled in a Ught brine, in which condition 
they are used for hors d'oeuvres, savouries, garnish^ 
or sauce. There are three kinds, the French, the 
Italian, and the Spanish, of which each kind has its 
admirers. To prepare them for savouries, &c., they 
are usually rinsed and " turned," as it is technically 
called, i,e., the stone is removed. To do this properly, 
with a sharp penknife cut a thin sHce from the stalk 
end to make it stand straight, then peel it from the 
thick end like an apple, but keeping the blade of 
the knife close along the stone all the time, to remove 
all the flesh in one thick spiral, which, if properly 
done, will readily press back into shape again. The 
cavity left by the stone is then filled with a fillet of 
anchovy, any savoury buttet, tVv\c,k \Si^^Q»TCSis>\^&fc> fe^

to taste. As a garnisli, the olive is usually served 
as a ragout, thus : Stone the olives and set them in 
a pan with enough good stock and light French wine 
(in equal parts) to cover them, just bring this to the 
boil again, then simmer gently till tender. This 
makes a deUcious sauce for fillets or tournedos of beef, 
and is the proper sauce for salmi of duck, wild or 
tame. Save for salmi, brown sauce and a little sherrv 
may replace the stock and the French wine. 

Olives, Tnock, — ^Choose small unripe green plums, 
and stone them with a column cutter. Put them 
into a jar with vine leaves between them, dust vnth 
a Httle fennel seed, a good amount of salt, and a tiny 
pinch of powdered alum, pour over them sufficient 
boiling oil to cover them, and when cold tie down. 
If plums prepared thus are stuffed with fillets of 
anchovy or sardine, packed in jars, and covered with 
good spiced vinegar, they make a by no means to 
be despised version of olives farcies. 

Onions {Oignons), — ^These, unlike other vegetables, 
need no cleansing beyond the removal of the stalk 
and top ends, and of one or two of the outer skins. 
But they do need blanching, a point often overlooked 
by our cooks, and hence the accusation of coarseness 
often brought against this vegetable. As soon as 
they are trimmed, blanch them by putting them on 
in slightly salted cold water, and as soon as this boils up 
strain it off, and if to be served plain boiled, finish 
boiling the onions in fresh salted boiling water till 
cooked, which will take, for large Spanish onions, 
from two to three hours, smaller ones of course taking 
proportionateiy less.

Onions a la Mtiscavite. — ^Blanch the onions as above. 
allowing them, however, to remain in the blanchin<: 
water till they are quite half cooked, then drain 
them and leave them tiU perfectly cold. Now remove 
the centre with a column cutter, or scoop it out with n 
teaspoon, being careful not to cut it through, tlien 
mince these centres with half their bulk of mushrooms 
and a small spoonful of freshly made breadcrumbs, 
put this all into a pan with a little good espa^nol«' 
sauce, and pepper, salt, and a very little nutmeg', 
and stir it all over the fire till of a nice cousistencv : 
then fill up the onions with the mixture, dust tlie to]) 
with breadcrumbs, put a tiny pat of butter, or well 
clarified dripping, on each, and bake in a modenite 
oven till nicely coloured. Serve very hot. 

au gratin. — Blanch the onions as above, 

then finish cooking them in milk and water till 
tender enough to sieve (or if preferred to niasli), 
mix them with a Httle of the liquid the}- were cooked 
in, a spoonful or two of cream, and a seasoning of sjilt , 
white pepper, and a Httle cayenne ; pour this ])un'e 
into a well buttered piedish (or shells, as you ])lease) 
previously dusted with breadcrumbs, grated elieese, 
and seasoning, cover the top witli the erumbs, elieese, 
seasoning, and a few drops of liquefied butter, and 
set in the oven for a few minutes till the top colours 
nicely. Another form of this dish is to sliee down 
some cold cooked onions (they should be rather under- 
cooked) and arrange them alternately with peeled 
and shced tomatoes, in a dish prepared as before, jind 
finish off as in the previous recipe. 

baked. — Blanch and three parts In^il in

milk and water, or plain water, six large Spanish 
onions, then place them on a well buttered baking 
tin, or dish, cover with breadcrumbs and morsels 
of butter or clarified dripping, and bake for about one 
hour in a moderate oven till nicely coloured and quite 
tender, and serve in the dish they were cooked in. 

Onions en casserole, — ^Top, tail, and peel some nice 
Portugal onions, then peel off one or two more 
skins and mince these, placing this mince with the 
whole onion into an earthenware casserole with ioz. 
of butter or clarified dripping for each onion, and 
let them cook slowly on the hot plate for about two 
hours, till perfectly tender. Serve in the casserole. 

fried, — Blanch the onions for five 

minutes (i.e., let them boil on for five minutes after 
the blanching water has boiled up), then lift them 
out, and let them cool ; after which slice them across 
finely into rings, toss these rings lightly in a clean 
cloth with a little flour, then place them (not too 
many at a time) in the frying basket, plunge them 
into very hot fat, for five or six minutes, till of a 
bright golden colour, drain, sprinkle with salt, and 
serve crisp and dry. 

glazed, — Trim some small pickling or 

silver onions, and place them in a well buttered 
saute pan, dusting them generously with caster 
sugar, shake th6 pan gently, and directly they begin 
to colour moisten them with enough stock to cover, 
add a Httle salt, and let them cook gently till tender 
and well coloured, and the stock has formed a glaze 
on them, rolling them over gently from time to time 
to glaze them evenly, and serve.

Onion juice. — ^This essence is most useful for 
flaTOuring. Bemove the outer skin, and grate the 
onion with a coarse grater ; wring it through a clean 
cloth, extracting every drop of juice. Or, pound 
the onions in a mortar with very Uttle water, then 
strain oS and bottle in closely stoppered bottles. A 
little garhc is a great improvement. If in a hurry, 
halve the onion, and partly scoop, partly press 
the juice out with a strong plated spoon, from the 
half. 

puree Bretonne. — ^Blanch and parboil 

the onions for five minutes, then drain and chop 
them coarsely, and put them on in a pan with 4oz. 
of butter or well clarified dripping, for six onions, 
and a good dust of sugar, with pepper and salt to 
taste ; stir this well till the onions are nicely and deeply 
coloured, then dredge on to it a tablespoonful of fine 
flour, and moisten it well with some good brown 
stock. Let this all simmer together till thoroughly 
cooked (about an hour or so), then rub it all through 
a sieve. Use stock according to the required density 
of the puree. 

Soubise, — ^Made precisely as before, but 

butter must be used for the dripping, and equal parts 
of milk and white stock for moistening, cure being 
taken never to let the onions colour. A spoonful of 
cream should be added at the last. 

salad. — »Just blanch tomatoes and onions 

and peel them (using one large onion for five or six 
tomatoes), and when perfectly cold slice the onion as 
thinly as possible, and the toniat^K^s about a quart<;r 
of an inch thir^k. Dish in alternate layt^rs with a

vinaigrette sauce (one gill salad oil, two dessertspoonfuls 
of vinegar, a saltspoonful of salt, and half a one of white 
pepper). Mix well and garnish with chives or onion 
threads. 

OnionSy sautes, — Trim some small pickling or 
silver onions and blanch them for fifteen minutes, 
then drain off and put them in a pan with plenty of 
butter, tossing them in this till done, but being very 
careful neither to let them colour nor break. 

stewed. — Trim, peel, and parboil some 

nice Spanish onions for ten minutes in salted water ; 
then dry them and halve them lengthwise. Put into 
a pan a shce of fat bacon, a bouquet, two or three 
cloves, some whole peppers, and a lump of loaf sugar, 
cover well with good white or brown stock (according 
to what you want the onions for), bring this just to 
the boil, then let it simmer for about two hours. 
Now set the onions aside and keep them hot, mean- 
while strain the liquor (if brown), remove all fat, 
and boil it up sharply till well reduced, then serve 
over and with the onions. If preferred the onion 
liquor may be, when reduced, added to any sauce to 
taste, which is then served with the onions, the name 
of the dish varying according to the sauce used. 
The first method is known as au jus. 

stuffed, — These are served like the Musco- 
vite dish, only varying the stufHng, which may be of 
anv kind of cooked meat, seasoned and mixed to taste. 
Or, again, when trimmed as for the onion en casserole^ 
a slice is cut off the top, the centre scooped out, and 
replaced by a trimmed and seasoned kidney, the top 
is fastened on again, and the whole is then finished

the parsley is to accompany, draw the pan to the side 
of the stove, leaving the basket, however, in the fat ; 
let the latter cool for three minutes or so, then 
drop in the parsley, and heat the fat very gradually, 
till the parsley is crisp, which it will be in about a 
minute ; then lift the sprigs out and drain them well 
on kitchen paper. It is better to have the fat rather 
too cool than too hot, for in the latter case the parsley 
would burn and discolour, whereas in the former it 
simply means cooking it a little longer. Be very 
careful when throwing the parsley into the hot fat to 
keep your head turned away whilst doing it, as the 
cold sprays often make the fat spurt up. 

Parsley, to blanch. — ^Pick the parsley into little 
sprays, and put these into cold salted water ; just 
bring this up to the boil, then strain off the leaves, 
rinse them well in cold water and use. 

to mince. — The parsley should always be 

well washed and very thoroughly dried in a clean 
cloth ; it must then be picked free of all stalks, the 
leaves being pressed together with the fingers, and 
shred across and across as finely as possible. Now 
•collect this mince in the corner of a cloth, fold it 
over very tightly, put it under the running tap, and 
rub and rinse it in water till the water becomes 
•quite green, then wring it dry again and use. The 
little extra trouble this entails is fully repaid by the 
appearance of the parsley, which will be as fine and 
dry as dust, and of a vivid green tint. 

juice. — Pick the fresh green leaves, 

pound them well in a mortar, and squeeze of! all the 
Juice possible into a jar ; stand this in the bain-marie. 



VEGETABLES. 5^ 

or in another pan full of boiling water, and leave it 
till the juice is warm, and then use. 

Parsley for icinter use. — ^There are two waj's of 
preserving parsley. One is in powder as follows : 
well wash and pick over some nice parsley, and tie 
it up into neat bunches ; blanch these for three to 
four minutes in boiling salted water, then drain 
them on a sieve in front of a sharp fire, very slowly, 
till they are dry enough almost (but not quite) to 
crumble, then store in wide mouthed, tightly stoppered 
bottles ; when wanted, soak for two or three minutes 
in warm water. K treated thus they may be hung up 
in paper bags in a warm kitchen till the parsley 
crumbles, when the leaves should be powdered, sifted 
through coarse muslin, and closely corked down in 
small, wide-mouthed bottles. The other way is, 
after washing and picking over the parsley, to dry it 
in a cloth, and put it in a single layer on a tray, or 
a tin lid, in a warm, but not too hot corner of the 
range or oven, and let it dry as quickly as possible, 
then store as before in small, wide-mouthed bottles. 

mock. — ^When parsley is not to be had 

tie up a little parsley seed in a piece of muslin, and 
lay this in the sauce, gravy, &c., you wish to flavour, 
adding, where the green leaves are also required, 
some finely minced and blanched spinach, or other 
green stuff. These directions may seem to be given 
at undue length, but few things are more useful in 
cookery than parsley, and, it must be added, few meet 
with worse treatment. 

Parsnip (Panais) a la crtme. — Peel some nice fresh 
parsnips, wash them well, and with a vegetable cvs^.^^^

juice of half a lemon, turn out on a hot dish, and serve 
very hot. 

Parsnip halls, — Wash, peel, and boil some parsnips 
from one to one and a-half hours, according to their 
size ; when tender drain and mash them with a 
wooden spoon. Now put two breakfastcupfuls of 
the mashed parsnips into a pan with one teaspoonful 
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter, the same of 
cream, and a dash of pepper, mix this all well, and 
stir it over the fire till bubbling ; then lift the pan from 
the fire, stir in one whole egg^ and let it stand till cold, 
when you roll the mixture into balls in your well- 
floured hands, tgg and breadcrumb them, and fry 
a golden brown in plenty of hot fat, then drain well, 
and serve very hot. 

boiled. — ^When to be served plainly boiled 

only just wash, and well brush them, but do not cut 
them ; lay them into a pan, and pour over them just 
sufficient boiling water to cover them ; watch this 
reboil, then draw the pan to the side, and let the 
parsnips simmer tiW quite tender, which will take about 



VEGETABLES. 97 

an hour and a half. Let the water put on with the 
parsnips reduce until, when they are cooked, there 
should scarcely be any water left in the pan. Never 
add any water during the cooking. Cooked thus, 
parsnips will possess a rich, creamy taste, and will be 
found as wholesome as they are nourishing. 

Parsnip cones, — ^Put the parsnips on in plenty of 
boiling water and boil for twenty to twenty-five 
minutes, then pour off this water and replace it with 
more fresh boiUng water, and continue the cooking 
till the vegetables are nearly tender, say for twenty-five 
minutes longer. (They may now, if liked, be served 
halved or quartered, with melted butter or egg sauce.) 
When nearly cooked cut the parsnips into even cone 
shapes, and toss these gently over the fire with a pat 
of butter, white pepper, salt, and a pinch of caster sugar 
till quite cooked. Serve plain, or with mattre d^hotel, 
fines herbes, or any other nice white sauce to taste. 
The parsnips must be quite young for this way of 
cooking. Young carrots or turnips also are very 
nice prepared thus. 

fried. — Wash and three parts cook the 

parsnips, then peel and cut them into shreds length- 
ways, and fry a delicate golden brown in a little 
butter. 

garnish, — ^Wash and three parts cook the 

parsnips, then peel and shred them as in the previous 
recipe ; put them on in boiling water, with salt and 
the juice of a lemon, and finish cooking them ; then 
strain off the water, mix in a pat of warm butter 
and a good spoonful of minced parsley, toss it all 
lightly together over the fixe, add «i. ^mc^^^^t^ cK\ws!iss\x

juice and use. Parsnips may be mashed after boiling 
them till tender enough to sieve, when you work in 
a little butter, milk, or cream, with white pepper and 
salt, over the fire, till brought to a nice consistency. 
They may also be scalloped thus : Take two cupf uls of 
mashed parsnip, as for parsnip balls, and pile this 
in a well-buttered fireproof dish ; sprinkle thickly 
with breadcrumbs, and some morsels of butter, 
or clarified dripping, dust with coralline pepper, 
and bake till nicely browned on the top. A few drops 
of essence of anchovy, or two or three spoonfuls of 
rich shrimp sauce laid over the bottom of the dish 
before putting in the parsnip, make a particularly 
good scallop. Parsnips may also be used as salad 
thus : Slice, or quarter, the cold cooked parsnips, 
and toss them lightly in sufficient French salad dres- 
sing to coat them well ; then dish with a garnish of 
spring onions, or onion threads, and some cold, 
hard-boiled eggs, halved and filled with anchovy, 
ham, or shrimp butter. 

Pea (Petits pois) to boU. — Put the peas on in plenty 
of salted water, with a spray or two of mint, and cook 
them as fast as possible with the lid off ; when cooked, 
drain them, lift out the mint, strain the peas, and 
put half of them into a hot vegetable dish, putting 
a small pat of butter in the centre, gathering the 
rest of the peas well over it, and serve hot. These are 
known as Petits Pois a VAnglaise^ and are immensely 
improved by adding a pinch of sugar when putting 
in the butter. The other and best way, to my mind, 
is to put the freshly-shelled peas into sufficient fast 
boiling water to cover them nicely^ adding a dessert- 



VEGETABLES. 99 

spoonful each of salt and caster sugar for each quart 
of water used ; boil the peas very fast with the cover 
off, for ten to twelve minutes, then drain the peas in 
a colander, and serve at once on a hot dish. A small 
spray of mint may be added this way if liked, but 
remember never to put any soda with peas, as it 
utterly ruins the young ones. Half an ounce of mint 
is required for each quart of water, which quantity is 
sufficient for one pint of peas (do not cook peas in 
a tinned saucepan). Abroad a kind of pea is often 
used of which the shell is served with the peas ; these 
pods are rather flat and broad, and are cooked thus : 
Partly cook them in a Httle salted water, and when 
nearly tender, drain them and lay them in a pan with 
a pat of butter, some finely chopped parsley and 
young green onions, with, if liked, a stewed lettuce, 
strained and shred rather fine ; season with white 
pepper and salt, and a dust of flour, and moisten 
with a little good stock. Cook this all together 
till quite tender, then stir in a tablespoonful of cream, 
and serve very hot. This is an excellent way of using 
the after crop which often appears on the pea vines 
too late to ripen properly, but of course the peas 
must be of a really good kind. It may be iidded that 
many foreign housewives consider old peas are 
improved if the shells are strung and clipped like 
French beans, and then put on in water with 2oz. 
of mint, a dessertspoonful of salt, and a little less of 
sugar, and boiled very fast for half an hour ; this pea- 
pod water is then carefully strained, and allowed to boil 
up again, when the peas are put in, and are allowed 
to cook for half an hour, l^^merc^x ^\\fc\N. ^^^aa* ^»x?^

shelled and have to wait, they should be put into a 
dry basin, and lightly covered with a damp cloth. 

Peas, jugged, — Shell a pint of green peas, and put 
them into a jar with a tight closing lid, lajdng in 
with them a tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful 
of salt, a teaspoonful of powdered sugar, a spray of 
mint, and a dust of freshly ground black pepper ; 
cover the jar down very tightly, and put it in a stew- 
pan or bain-marie half full of boiling water, cover 
down the pan, and let the water boil sharply, examin- 
ing them from time to time to see if they are done ; 
young peas will take from thirty to thirty-five minutes 
in this way, older ones of course needing longer 
cooking. This method is a particularly good one for 
tinned peas. The peas should be turned into a 
colander or strainer, and held under running water 
till any " tinny " taste is entirely removed, finishing 
them as before ; twelve to fifteen minutes will be 
ample in this case. Peas cooked in this way, or even 
if freshly boiled, can be diversified in many ways. 
For instance, ham, or bacon, cut into small dice, 
fried crisp, and stirred into the peas as you dish them, 
give the well known petits pots au lard, or au jamhon ; 
or, when you pour them into the dish, mix in a few 
spoonfuls of bi'^chamel or veloute sauce, or cream, or 
butter, as you please. These are excellent as a garnish, 
and take their name from the sauce, &c., added at 
the last. 

stewed. — This is the best method of cooking 

old peas, though abroad it is often used for young 

ones. Melt a couple of ounces of butter with a small 

sl/eed onion, a bunch oi paxdey, atiA «vX\v«i v^me 



VEGETABLES. 101 

sprays of mint, or half a head of lettuce tied up together ; 
add white pepper and salt to taste ; let this cook 
till the onion is very faintly coloured, when you add 
the peas, a small teaspoonful of sugar, and as much 
water, or stock, as will float them ; half a pint is 
sufficient for one and a half pints of peas. Now let 
them stew very gently till the peas are perfectly tender 
(young peas take half an hour thus), then remove the 
lettuce, onions, and parsley, thicken the Uquid with 
a Uttle white roux (or ^oz. each of butter and flour 
simmered together till perfectly smooth and well 
blended), shake the saucepan well to mix all this 
thoroughly, add, if necessary, a tiny dust of caster 
sugar, and serve. French cooks often stir in at the 
last the yolk of an egg beaten up with a little milk, 
instead of the flour and butter thickening. They 
also put in the onion whole, for the convenience of 
lifting it out. Peas cooked in this way are known 
as Fetits pois a la Frangaise, or a la Bourgeoise. 

Feas en puree. — ^This is the best form of cooking 
old peas. Boil them as described above, preferably 
in the pea pod water, till tender enough to sieve, then 
add a tablespoonful of cream, ^oz. or so of butter, 
a Uttle freshly ground black pepper, salt, and a dust 
of sugar, and use either as a mould or forced out with 
a pipe and bag. 

salad. — Gold boiled peas may be utilised 

as an extremely pleasant salad, either by themselves, 
or in conjunction with young carrots, &c., and either 
a French dressing, or a good mayonnaise sauce. 
Thus treated they are an effective addition to a dish

PeaSy dried. — These can be utilised when fresh 
peas are unobtainable, and, nicely prepared, make a 
decidedly praiseworthy addition to the menu. The 
ordinary yellow dried peas may be used, but the green- 
dried Italian peas are preferable, if only for their 
appearance. Soak the peas for eighteen to twenty- 
four hours, then throw away this water, and put the 
peas in a pan with a couple of onions stuck with two 
or three cloves, a bunch of thyme and parsley, a 
bayleaf, and some peppercorns all tied up together, 
with enough cold water to fill the saucepan. Bring 
this to the boil, then allow it all to simmer till the peas 
are quite tender, when the water is poured off and 
they are tossed over the fire with a pat of butter, a 
drop or two of spinach or vegetable green colouring, 
pepper and salt, a tiny dust of sugar, and a spoonful 
of cream or good stock to moisten them, and served 
very hot. If liked, the peas may, when tender, 
be sieved, moistening them during the sieving with 
either their own liquor or a little stock, and finished 
off as before. A thick slice of bacon boiled with 
the peas in the first place is a great addition. 

pudding. — For this the ordinary dried 

peas may be used, but the pudding is far more delicate 
if the green-dried Italian peas are used, together with 
a drop or two of vegetable green colouring. Tie up 
a pint of peas very loosely in a clean cloth, and put 
them on in a panful of cold water, bring this gently 
to the boil, then let it all cook steadily for at least 
two hours, when you sieve the peas, mix them with 
} to loz. of fresh butter, a finely sUced onion, with 
pepper and salt to taste. INow t\fe t\iei ^^eaa >x^ ^

Potatoes {Pommes de terre). — Potatoes are a staple 
food in Great Britain, but it is safe to say that nowhere 
are they so badly treated and wasted. Their goodness 
depends largely on the cooking, and on the choice of 
kinds. For boiling, baking, &c., the floury kinds 
should always be chosen, but for salad, and the 
various French ways of cooking them, choose a 
waxy potato. French cooks always choose a special 
long-shaped and waxy tuber, which they call ** Vite- 
lotted The failure of our cooks in mastering the art 
of pommes soufflees, sautees, (&c., is frequently due to 
ignorance of this fact. Well scrub and thoroughly 
rinse the potatoes first, and then peel them (very 
thinly) as soon before use as possible, for if left 
soaking in water for ever so long, as is often their 
fate, they lose flavour and goodness. If potatoes 
are peeled too thickly they are apt to break to pieces in 
the cooking. If you are particular as £o your potatoes, 
never let them be peeled at all before they are cooked, 
as if peeled before cooking they become watery. 

boiled. — Choose even sized, well cleansed 

potatoes, and put them on in plenty of fast-boiling 
salted water (use a tablespoonful of salt to half a 
gallon of water), just bring the wafc^t \f^ \kNfc Nass^

cooked. (If you must use uneven-sized potatoes, 
put the larger ones into the boiUng water a few minutes 
before the smaller ones, so as to have them ready 
together.) Test them with a skewer, and as soon as 
this pierces them easily they are ready ; now strain 
the water of! them at once (if left in the water after 
this point they are apt to burst), shake the saucepan 
lightly, and set it at the side of the stove, remove the 
lid, replace it by a folded clean cloth or napkin, and 
let them stand for five minutes or so, by which time, 
if the potatoes are of a good kind, they will be quite 
dry and floury. Now take them up, peel them 
quickly, and send to the table at once. If preferred 
they may be served unpeeled, or "in their jackets " 
as it is called, which is the Irish, and certainly the best, 
way of serving them. The reason for giving potatoes 
plenty of water to cook in is that all starchy things, 
as they are, need plenty of room to swell in, and if 
crushed together in a small quantity of water, are 
very apt to burst. When potatoes are old they must 
be peeled before cooking, and, moreover, must have 
the " eyes " and bruises cut out of them. In this 
case fill the saucepan with cold salted water, trim 
and peel the potatoes, dropping each as done into 
the pan ; now just bring this all to the boil, and let 
it all simmer for twenty minutes or more, 
according to size, then strain of! the water and either 
finish as before, or strain, shake of! any moisture left 
on them, and serve at once as they are. In Ireland 
potatoes are always cooked in their jackets, and for 
this purpose are put on in an iron pot, with a good 
Bupply of salted water, and boiled till the akina crack ?

the water is then drained off, and the pot left on the 
fire with a doubled cloth on it for fifteen minutes or 
so, and then served. Cooked thus they always have 
what an Irish cook calls " a bone in 'em," i.e., they 
are a trifle firm in the centre, though a mass of flour 
all round. Potatoes take about twenty-five minutes 
to boil, if full grown or old. 

Olive potatoes, or potatoes *' turned " with a veget- 
able cutter to any shape required, are boiled exactly 
in the same way, only needing extra care not to cook 
them too fast, or to overboil them, in which case they 
break 

Pommes Anna, — ^This is a capital way of using 
potatoes when too old to boil nicely, though of course 
the dish is very delicate if made with young ones. 
Wash, peel, and sUce thinly as many potatoes as you 
require, then arrange them in layers in a well buttered 
charlotte mould, seasoning each layer as you pack it 
in, with salt and dissolved butter. Continue these 
layers till the mould is full and closely packed, then 
cover with a buttered paper, and bake in a hot oven 
for one to one and a quarter hours, when you turn 
it out on to a hot dish, and serve at once. The mould 
must be put into the oven directly it is packed, for 
if left standing the potatoes are apt to go black.

Line a plain hexagon or round mould with aspic jelly, 
and garnish this with little pea-shapes of cooked 
potato and cucumber, sprays of chervil, stamped- 
out rounds of tomato aspic, and, if handy, little fancy 
shapes of sliced truffle, setting this garnish with a 
little more jelly. When this is fairly firm pour in 
the potato puree, and put the mould away on ice 
till set ; then turn it out and serve with the following 
sauce : Cut up the rest of the cucumber used for the 
garnish into dice, and cook this till tender enough 
to sieve, and when cold add to this puree a gill of 
mayonnaise, half a gill of whipped cream, a tablespoon- 
ful of tarragon vinegar, and a pinch each of salt and 
caster sugar. Colour this with a drop or so of 
vegetable green colouring (keep it very delicate), add 
at least two tablespoonfuls of just liquid aspic, and use. 
Potatoes a la creme. — Slice down a plateful of raw 
potatoes (using the waxy or Vitelotte ones for choice), 
then put into the pan 2oz. of butter and a small 
tablespoonf ul of fine flour, and stir this gently together 
till smoothly blended, but quite colourless ; then 
moisten it gradually with a pint of cold milk (hot 
may be used, but the cold is richer), stirring it all 
the time. Directly this boils lay in the potatoes, 
which should be well covered with the milk, add a 
little salt, put the Hd on the pan, weighting it with a 
heavy weight, and let it all simmer till cooked, which 
it should be in about half an hour. Serve in a hot

shaking the pan and turning the potatoes over to get 
the bottom layer to the top during the process. It 
does not matter if a few of the sUces brown a little, in 
fact they improve the dish, but they must be the 
exception, 

a la mar^chale. — ^Prepare the potatoes 

as for Pommes Anna, and stew them very gently in

and arrange them in a well-buttered fireproof dish 
in layers, dusting each layer with grated Parmesan, 
white and coralline pepper, and moisten with dissolved 
butter. When the dish is full, bake in a gentle oven 
for thirty minutes, and serve in the dish they were 
cooked in. Ordinary cold boiled potatoes are nice 
cooked this way, if the buttered dish is dusted with 
fine white breadcrumbs, finely minced parsley, grated 
cheese, and black and red pepper, the potatoes being 
laid in as before, finishing the top with crumbs, 
cheese, &c., and cooking it till it browns nicely on 
the top. This is known as P. an gratin.

many varieties of this dish, for cold potatoes may 
be advantageously reheated in tomato, rich Alle- 
mande, maitre d'hotel, or indeed any good rich white 
sauce for a change. Floury potatoes are not so good 
for this as more waxy ones, as the former, unless 
very carefully handled, are apt to go to pieces. 

Potatoes, baked, — ^For these choose large ones, 
as much of a size and shape as possible, wash them 
well, and scrub the skins perfectly clean; then dry 
them thoroughly and bake in a good, but not too 
fierce oven, turning them now and again whilst 
baking. A few minutes before they are ready, prick 
them once or twice with a fine skewer to let out the 
steam, serving them when cooked on a napkin, and 
sending butter to table with them. There are many 
variations of this dish, one being the famous pommes 
Georgette ; for this, when the potatoes are baked 
(which, by the way, takes from an hour and three- 
quarters to two hours, according to size), cut the 
top o£E neatly, and scoop out a good deal of the inside, 
being careful not to break the skin ; mash this through 
a masher, keeping it as hght as possible, and mix it 
quickly with some rich shrimp sauce, replace it in 
the potato, cover it with the piece cut off, return 
it to the oven to get thoroughly hot, and serve. 
Another form of this dish is made by mixing grated 
Parmesan cheese, a good dust of coralline pepper, 
and a Uttle minced parsley with the potato snow, 
and finish as before. The great secret in these last 
two dishes is to have the potato as light and floury 
as possible, as otherwise it soddens when mixed with 
the other ingredients. Baked ^t^U)^ \v^ watching

whilst cooking, for if left too long before pricking 
they win burst ; whilst if pricked too soon they 
dry up, shrivel, and harden. 

Potatoes, hak$d. — ^Another form of baked potatoes is 
not so often seen as it was formerly, when meat was 
roasted at the open fire. For these boil some good 
floury potatoes (be careful not to overcook them), then 
remove the skins carefully. About an hour before 
the meat is done, dredge the potatoes lightly with 
fine flour, and place them in the dripping-pan under 
the meat, letting them finish cooking with it ; now 
drain very carefully, and serve as hot as possible, 
either as a garnish to the meat, or separately. 

border, — ^Boil the potatoes and peel them, 

then rub them lightly through a wire sieve. For 
three average-sized potatoes allow loz. butter, one 
raw yolk of egg, and a dust of coralline pepper, mix 
these well, and shape it into a border with your well- 
floured hands, using as little flour as you can ; when 
shaped brush it all over with beaten ^ggy mark it 
with a knife, and bake a golden brown. This is 
very useful for mounting cutlets, fillets of beef, <frc.

to match as neatly as may be. Put each case when 
ready into a basin of cold, salted, and sUghtly acidu- 
lated water, till you have prepared the required 
number, then lift them out, dry each well on a clean 
cloth, and fry them in clean, hot fat for three or four 
minutes tiU they feel tender ; they are then lifted 
out, and drained for a minute ; now let the fat reboil, 
and just as you want to serve the cases, drop them 
into this, and let them crisp and colour nicely; then 
drain well, dust them lightly with minced parsley 
and coraUine pepper, and serve filled with any nice 
mince or ragoiit to taste. 

Potatoes, curried. — Slice finely a Spanish onion 
and a good-sized apple, and fry them in 2oz. of butter 
or clarified dripping till of a delicate brown ; now 
dredge in a tablespoonful each of curry powder and 
fine rice flour, and fry these also, then moisten with 
the juice of a lemon and one and a half pints of any 
light stock (meat or vegetable), and let it all cook 
gently together till the onion is tender, when you sieve 
it all into a clean pan, add to it cooked potatoes, cut 
into slices the size and thickness of a florin, and let 
it get hot together ; serve with a border of rice 
seasoned with coralline pepper. 

Duchesse. — ^Boil or bake half a dozen 

good potatoes, then rub them through a fine wire 
sieve, and mix this puree with an ounce of butter,

and slightly oval in shape, and fry them in plenty 
of hot fat, turning them over and over, and serve 
directly both sides are well coloured. These duchesses 
are variously flavoured by different cooks, some 
adding grated Parmesan, others grated ham or tongue, 
to the mixture, and most consider a dash of nutmeg 
or mace a great improvement, but these of course 
are matters of taste. Other cooks keep them ball- 
shaped, making them originally about the size of a 
chestnut, and then egg and breadcrumb them, and 
fry them in plenty of hot fat ; but these are strictly 
either potato balls or potato croquettes. Another 
way is to divide up the paste into strips, powdering 
these well with grated Parmesan and coralline pepper, 
then with your well-floured hands roll each strip into 
sticks three or four inches long, and rather thicker 
than a pencil, egg and breadcrumb these, fry, drain, 
and serve dusted with freshly-grated Parmesan and 
coralline pepper ; these are sometimes called Batons 
au Parmesan, 

Potatoes^ fried. — ^Peel and cut the potatoes into 
wedge shapes, like the divisions of an orange both 
in shape and size ; have ready some very hot fat, 
and try this by dropping in a piece of the potato, 
if this becomes firm and colours lightly in a few 
seconds, the fat is ready. Now put your potatoes 
into the frying basket, and plunge this gently into 
the friture, being careful to keep them well covered 
with the fat; in three to four minutes they will be 
ready, when you lift the frying basket from the fat, 
allowing the potatoes to drain back for a minute 
into the jjan, then place tVifeixv ow \L\\,^^^ ^^^as^^.

and allow them to drain for a minute or two in front 
of the fire. Dust with fine salt, and serve at once very 
hot. These are the real Pommes Frites of the Parisian 
restaurants ; but the potatoes may be sliced or cut 
into any shape preferred, or cut as you peel an apple, 
these ribbons being dropped into boiling fat precisely 
as before. If you cut the potatoes (choosing very 
long ones) into long, narrow strips, one-eighth of 
an inch in depth and width, crisping them for twelve 
or fifteen minutes in a little cold acidulated water, 
and fry them in the same way as the fried potatoes, 
they are the well-known Pommes Pailles or Potato 
Straws. Some cooks prepare these potatoes in the 
same way as described for the potato cases, frying 
them twice. The well-known American novelty, 
Saratoga Potatoes, are simply potatoes washed, peeled, 
and sliced as evenly and thinly as possible (a special 
cutter is generaUy used for this, and saves much 
labour, though not absolutely indispensable), and 
fried as above till perfectly crisp and of a pretty 
golden brown, then drained, dusted with salt, and 
served very hot. These, and indeed most well-fried 
potatoes, may be kept in airtight tins for some 
time, and only require reheating for a few seconds 
in boiling fat. 

Potatoes, mashed. — ^Boil some potatoes, and steam 
them till perfectly dry, when you beat them up with 
a common kitchen fork, adding in as you do so a 
little butter, pepper, and salt, with a little milk or 
cream, working them with the fork till they are 
smooth and white ; then arrange them in a vegetable 
dish, marking them with the fork. If liked, when

may be baked if preferred, which of course makes 
them lighter. The French method of mashing 
potatoes is more of a puree than ours ; for this, when 
the potatoes are boiled, drain off all the water, and 
return them to the pan, lightly mashing them as 
before, and working them to a smooth, creamy con- 
sistency, with an extra amount of butter and a 
spoonful or two of either good stock or cream, season- 
ing it with white pepper and a grate of nutmeg ; this 
can never be moulded, but is sent to table when of 
the consistency of very thick cream. Indeed, as a 
matter of fact, a little whipped cream is often added 
to it at the last. 

Potatoes, new, to boU. — These should be cooked 
as soon as possible after digging. Well wash them 
and rub them with a dry cloth, but never attempt 
to peel them. Put them on in boiling water, and 
let them cook for fifteen minutes, when you drain 
off the water, and let them dry like old potatoes. 
They are then usually put into a vegetable dish with 
a little melted butter, and sprinkled with a little 
minced parsley. A favourite way of serving new 
potatoes, when cooked as above, is to dish them in 
a pile, and pour the following sauce over them : 
Melt together loz. of butter and loz. of flour, with a 
pinch of salt, and when this is smooth and perfectly 
blended, moisten gradually with half a pint of ci m 
or new milk, and bring it to the boil \ ^\Mt \X 'cn 
the new potatoes, and serve du«»teA VnXXx^sjl^

potatoes, though they are by no means the same 
thing, and indeed are cooked quite differently. West 
country cooks viery often cook cold cooked potatoes 
in this way in bacon fat, and serve with fried bacon, 
in which form they are decidedly good. 

Potato snow, — ^Choose the whitest potatoes, and 
put them on in cold water ; when they begin to 
crack, strain them and set them in a clean pan before 
the fire till they are dry and falling to pieces, then 
rub them lightly through a wire sieve into the hot 
vegetable dish they are to be served in. Some people 
place a small pat of butter on to the first layer of 
these grated potatoes, but it is hardly to be recom- 
mended, as it is apt to make the potatoes sodden. 

souffle. — ^Wash and bake three large 

potatoes, and when cooked halve them, remove 
the inside, and sieve this ; work into this the yolks 
of two raw eggs and the whites of four, well-whipped, 
two tablespoonfuls of grated Parmesan cheese, l^oz. 
of warmed butter, and a dust each of coralline pepper 
and salt ; fill the half skins with this mixture, sprinkle 
the tops with a few browned breadcrumbs, some 
grated Parmesan cheese, and a Uttle coralline pepper, 
with some morsels of butter, and bake for fifteen 
minutes in a moderate oven. If preferred, this 
mixture may be baked in a regular souffle dish, and 
is very good in that way. 

souffiees, — ^This is a version of fried potatoes 

very common abroad, but requiring a Httle knack 
and some practice to ensure success. Gut the potatoes 
into the wedge shapes recommended, iox \>Ckfc Vfis^

and cook them till tender and very lightly coloured, 
shaking them all the time they are cooking ; now 
lift the basket out of the fat, and put them aside for a 
minute in a warm place, return the frying kettle 
to the fire, heat the fat very quickly, and return the 
potatoes to them, stirring them very gently for a 
minute or two in it, when they should be puffed up 
and swollen : then drain them well, and serve verv 
quickly on a hot dish, dusted with salt. The great 
secret in cooking thes& lies in the first frying ; they 
should be cooked first till on lifting one and biting 
it, it bites quite short and soft, and is only very faintly 
coloured on the outside. Be vjery careful only to 
put a few at a time into the pan the second time, 
because if they knock together in the frying they 
will harden and not puff out properly. They are 
well worth the little trouble they entail. It is 
manifestly impossible in a book of this size to give 
even a tithe of the almost innumerable methods of 
cooking potatoes, but the above may serve to help 
an intelligent cook in the production of variety. 

Pumpkin (Potiron). — Seldom seen in this country 
save as soup, but abroad, in the United States especi- 
ally, it is a great favourite, especially as " pie ** ; 
but its normal condition is mashed, for which you 
take a good slice from a large pumpkin, remove the 
outside peel, and the seeds with the pulpy tissue 
adhering to them, and cut the flesh into inch cubes ; 
cook these in boiling salted water for twenty minutes 
or so, till tender, then drain well, press out every 
drop of liquid, and beat the pulp up lightly with a 
J/ttle butter, pepper, salt, and a<\\Xt\^ (^^^?k\ft.\l V»-wdY. 



VEGETABLES. 117 

Another (French) method is, after preparing the 
pumpkin as before, to dry the cubes in a clean cloth, 
dust them with fine dry flour, and place a layer of 
these cubes in a fireproof dish brushed over with oil, 
dusting this layer well with black pepper, minced 
parsley, chives (or shallot), and good salad oil, repeating 
these two layers till the dish is full ; bake till tender, 
when you pour off any superfluous oil, and serve, 
Some cooks add grated Parmesan cheese to the 
seasoning. 

Pumpkin pie. — Prepare the pumpkin as before, 
and cook it in a small quantity of water till quite 
tender, then sieve it. To each teacupful of this puree 
allow one well-beaten whole egg^ a teacupful of milk, 
and caster sugar to taste. Season this with some 
ground ginger and nutmeg, beat it all well together, 
and pour a breakfastcupful of this into an ordinary 
dinner (or, if preferred, soup) plate, previously lined 
with puff pastry, and bake. Eat cold. 

Purslane (Pourpier), — ^This was formerly much 
valued as a garden herb, but nowadays it is seldom 
seen, though some old-fashioned cooks still use the 
young shoots in salad, and the older ones as potherbs. 
Abroad it is still in request, for salads especially, but 
even for " fines herhes " the French cook considers 
purslane, or pourpier as she calls it, indispensable. 

Radish (Bad is). — ^These in this country are seldom 
if ever seen otherwiJse than raw, yet formerly here, 
and still on the Continent, they may be met with 
cooked, and very good they are. Well washed and 
trimmed, radishes, the round ones especialIY^ to^^^c^ 
a favourite hors d*OBUVi^. 



118 VEGETABLES. 

Radish, boiled. — ^Trim the radishes neatly, plunge 
them in fast-boiling salted water, and cook till tender 
(about thirty minutes), drain, and serve with melted 
butter. 

leaveSy boiled. — ^Pick over the leaves, 

removing any old or faded ones and the thickest 
of the stalks. Let them steep in cold water for half 
an hour, then drain and boil them in fast-boiling 
salted water till tender (from twenty-five to thirty- 
five minutes). Now lift them out, mince pretty 
finely, season with a little butter, pepper, and salt, 
and serve. They may also be finished off like spinach. 
Specially good with roast ham, pork, &c. 

Rampion, — A plant of the campanula tribe, formerly 
much more in request than at present, though abroad 
it is still cidtivated and liked. The roots were the part 
liked, and were gently boiled till tender, then served 
hot with melted butter, or cold with oil, vinegar, 
pepper, and salt. 

Ravigotte, — ^This is a name applied to minced herbs 
served abroad for a garnish, either to salads, savoury 
butter, or sauce. The commonest form is green 
tarragon, chervil, chives, and burnet, but almost every 
cook has his or her special blend of herbs for this pur- 
pose. In France, where the salad is often prepared at 
tlie dining table, the herbs are cliopped and dished in 
separate little heaps to allow the mixer to make 
his own proportions. 

Saffron, or Saffern (Safran), — ^The dried stigmas 
of the winter crocus, much used formerly as a flavour- 
ing for cakes, hashes, &c., and still used in the Levant 
in pilaffs, &c. Its use probably died out in this 



.VEGETABLES. 119 

country from the difficulty of bujdng it pure. It is 
sold as " hay saffron " and ** cake saffron." Where 
the flavour is liked, it is well worth keeping as an 
extract, made thus : Put a small amount of saffron 
in a jar, say half an ounce or so, and pour on to it a 
full gill of boiling water, leave till all the colour is 
extracted, then use or bottle. 

Sage (Sauge). — ^This is a kind of Salvia, much used 
in the preparation of stuffing for duck, goose, or pork. 
The leaves are used fresh or powdered, but in the 
former case any cook who respects her art will care 
fully blanch the sage leaves for five minutes in boiling 
water, and dry them carefully, before mincing them 
for stuffing, to which they give a strong, crude flavour 
if this precaution is omitted. 

Salad (Salade). — ^This is a mixture of either raw 
or cooked vegetables, served cold, tossed in either 
a French salad dressing or in mayonnaise sauce. 
In this country we have an evil habit of mixing raw 
vegetables to an almost infinite extent, but abroad, 
where delicacy of flavour is more studied, one or 
at most two, vegetables are tossed in the dressing, 
and served with a fourniture of minced herbs chosen 
from the following list : Parsley, chives or onion 
threads, tarragon, chervil, purslane, pimpernel, &c. 
Salad is a most wholesome companion to meat of 
every kind, and should be seen almost daily on our 
tables. Lettuce of either kind is not the only founda- 
tion necessary, for endive, tomatoes, onions, &c., 
may be served alone or in combination, or with cold 
cooked vegetables as you please. This, needless to 
say, refers to plain salads simply; fancy salads 



120 TSQfiTABLES« 

(previously described in No. IX. of this series), may be 
composed of almost everything, fish, flesh, fowl, 
or vegetable. The two following recipes give examples. 

Salad Gauloise, — ^Wipe, cleanse, and sUce some 
raw mushrooms, mixing them with sliced truffles, 
cold cooked (waxy) potatoes, and cos lettuce. Serve 
with a French or mayonnaise garnish. 

Hongroise. — Scald, peel, and slice rather 

thickly, some ripe and well-coloured tomatoes, dust 
them plentifully with freshly-ground black pepper, 
salt, a dust of cayenne, and some very finely-minced 
shallot or chives; now sprinkle these slices with oil 
and tarragon vinegar, and set them on ice till wanted. 
Serve garnished with whipped or clotted cream, 
into which you have stirred some coralline pepper 
and finely-minced chives or parsley. See that this is 
icy cold when served. 

For a French salad dressing, put into a basin a 
good pinch of freshly-ground black pepper, half a tea 
spoonful of salt, and a scant tablespoonf ul of tarragon 
(or plain) vinegar, and stir this well together till 
the salt is perfectly dissolved ; now work into the 
mixture three full tablespoonfuls of good salad oil 
(Provence oil is generally the sweetest) ; lay in your 
salad, and toss it well over and over in this dressing 
till each leaf, &c., has imbibed its proper share, then 
lift them out with the salad servers into the salad 
bowl, and serve. Never mix salad in the salad bowl 
unless you have personally wiped every leaf, &c., 
or you will find a sloppy residuum at the bottom of 
the bowl that will quite spoil the flavour. Do not 
forget either that salad should only be mixed just 



VEGETABLES. 121 

as it is wanted. For mayonnaise^ put into a basin 
one raw egg yolk, an eggspoonful of mustard (either 
French or English, or half of each), and a pinch each 
of salt and white pepper ; mix this all with a deU- 
cately clean wooden spoon (a special spoon should 
always be kept for salad-mixing), adding, drop by 
drop, enough good oil to bring it all to the consistency 
of butter, and, lastly, add a teaspoonful or so of best 
vinegar, plain or flavoured. This will make about 
half a pint of sauce, and will take up about one-third 
of a pint of oil. There are, of course, many different 
forms of mayonnaise, but these have been given with 
the fancy salads to which they belong. Never, if 
possible, let a mayonnaise salad stand after it is 
mixed, or the vegetables will get soppy and sodden ; 
whilst exposure to the air will give the dressing a 
most unpleasant, rank flavour. 

falsify (Salsifi). — ^This vegetable appears to be 
returning to favour again, after being almost forgotten 
for many years, and it is certainly well worth culti- 
vating and preparing. There are two kinds, the white 
salsify and the black or scorzanera ; the former is 
eaten in its first year's growth, but the latter is not 
ready under two years. Scorzanera should never be 
scraped or peeled till it is cooked, as if cut or scratched 
when raw all its flavour and juice exudes. 

to boil. — For lib. of the vegetable put into 

a pan rather more than a pint of water, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a dessertspoonful of vinegar or lemon 
juice, and about 2oz. of butter or well clarified 
dripping, stir this till it boils, then lay in the salsify, 
neatly trimmed and cut into three inch lengths. 



122 VEGETABLES. 

Let it just reboil, then draw it to the side, and let 
it simmer slowly but steadily for half an hour ; now 
drain well, and serve with melted butter, drawn 
butter, or any nice white sauce to taste. The pot lid 
should be kept a little of! whilst the salsify is cooking. 
Cooked thus the salsify may be drained, floured, 
and fried; or dipped in batter, fried in hot fat, 
then well drained and served hot, dusted with grated 
Parmesan cheese and coralUne pepper. Or it may 
be served with marrow, and a rich brown sauce, 
after the style of cardes a la moelle, or, indeed, by 
any recipe given for celery, cardoons, &c. Delicious 
vegetarian patties may be made thus : Prepare a 
rather thin puree of salsify (by boiling it till tender 
enough to sieve, rubbing it through, moistening it as 
you do so with some of the water in which it was 
cooked, and seasoning it to taste with white and 
coralline pepper, salt, a few drops of lemon, and the 
same of essence of anchovy) ; stir into this small, 
rather thick slices of previously cooked salsify, let 
it all reheat, without actually boiling, stir in an egg 
yolk beaten up with a spoonful or two of cream, 
or use two or three spoonfuls of thick cream, and pour 
this into some small puff pastry patties, dust with a 
little finely-minced parsley and coralline pepper, 
and serve at once. If made with salsify this is a 
delicious dish, but if scorzanera is used, and the 
flavouring is carefully done, the oyster taste is unmis- 
takeable. For this reason the Americans call scor- 
zanera the ** oyster plant." Cold cooked salsify, 
sprinkled with oil and vinegar, and a fourniture 
of minced herbs, is very nice with either a French 



.VEGETABLES. 123 

salad dressing or mayonnaise, but perhaps even more 
delicate if sprinkled with minced chives, parsley, 
coralline pepper, and lemon juice, and served with 
plain cream stood on ice till perfectly cold without 
being actually frozen. A dainty garnish for cutlets 
and fillets of all kinds is made thus : Cleanse and 
peel the salsify {not scorzanera), throwing each piece 
as trimmed into slightly salted and acidulated water 
to preserve the colour. When prepared, put the 
salsify into a panful of salted and acidulated water, 
with ^oz. or so of butter, and cook it for an hour, 
then drain, shred it very finely, and use. 

Samphire (Bacile or Perce-pierre). — ^This plant 
grows wild all along the sea coast, and has been held 
in honour as a pickle for generations — to such a 
point that other plants somewhat like it have been 
substituted for it when the supply of samphire ran 
short ; but as these substitutes are not as aromatic 
as the real plant, this adulteration for some time 
brought the original into disrepute. But once the 
real samphire has been seen and tasted (the raw 
fleshy leaves have a salty, spicy taste), it is easy to 
distinguish. It should be gathered in May, or, at 
all events, before the flower begins to show, for after 
that it becomes hard and stringy. Choose the greenest 
samphire, and lay it in a pan with three or four table- 
spoonfuls of salt over it, then pour in sufiicient 
cold water to cover it, and let it steep for twenty-four 
hours. Now drain of! the water, and lay the samphire 
in a large copper pan with a good tablespoonful of 
salt, cover the pan down closely, and let it cook over 
a very slow fire till it is quite crisp and green ; then 



124 YEGBTABLES. 

lift it o£E at once, for if allowed to stay on the fire till 
it softens it is spoiled. Pack it at once in a jar, cover 
it, and, when cold, fasten this cover down tightly. 
Another way is to prepare the samphire as before, 
but when drained from the steeping water, dry 
carefully in a clean cloth, lay it into jars, and pour 
over it sufficient boiling white wine vinegar (previously 
boiled with a small amount of ginger, mace, and 
whole pepper) to cover it, let it stand tiU cold, then 
cover down tightly, and store. This will be ready 
for use in a fortnight. 

Sauercraui (Choucroute). — ^This is a German form 
of pickled cabbage much liked abroad, and gaining 
in popularity even here. It is generally bought 
ready prepared, but the process is not a difficult 
one. For this choose large, firm, and white cabbages, 
trim off the outside and all damaged leaves, and 
wash it well in plenty of well-salted water. Now shred 
it down very finely, removing all the tough stalks; 
wash the discarded green outer leaves (not the damaged 
ones) carefully in cold salted water, then with them 
line neatly a firkin or clean wooden tub, and place 
on this a layer of the shred cabbage, then a layer of 
salt ; continue these layers till the tub is nearly 
full, pressing down the shredded cabbage with your 
fist or a potato masher, so as to pack it as closely 
as possible. Now cover the cabbage with a clean 
board, set a heavy weight on this, and leave it in a 
cool dry place for six weeks. A pint of salt to the 
peck of cabbage is the usual proportion, and to this 
many German housewives add peppercorns and a 
Uttle powdered coriander seed. To cook it, wash 



VEGETABLES. 125 

the required amount thoroughly in two or three 
waters till it is only pleasantly salt, then put it on 
in plenty of boiling water, and let it cook steadily 
till tender, when it must be drained, and served on a 
hot vegetable dish. Any left over can be fried in 
butter, or dripping, or minced and heated with a little 
butter, cream, or good meat gravy. Abroad it is 
usually cooked with a piece of pickled pork, bacon, 
or sausages, and served with the meat upon it. It 
is especially good with sausages. 

Scallion — ^This, often mentioned in old cookery 
books, is simply another name for shallot, which see. 

Seakale (Chou de mer). — ^This may be cooked in 
any way recommended for celery, and is particularly 
good au gratin, in fritters, served with any rich 
sauce, or cold as a salad. Seakale takes twenty 
minutes to boil and needs attention, for if in the 
least overboiled it hardens and toughens, and nothing 
will soften it. 

Shallot (Echalotte). — A kind of small onion, much 
used for flavourings, sauces, &c. Its flavour is more 
marked, but also more delicate, than that of the 
common onion. It is used for faumiture, and for a 
d'uxelles mince, when chives are unobtainable. It 
makes a most delicate flavouring, if infused either 
in vinegar or white wine. 

Skirret (Chervis). — Brought over from China, this 
root was at one time very popular, as it is a good 
winter vegetable, if dug up as soon as the plant's 
summer growth is over. The root (fleshy white 
tubers the size of a flnger), with a delicate sweet 
Itaste, is the part eaten, and may be cooked in any 



126 VEGETABLES. 

way given for parsnips. Abroad it is much used as a 
garnish. 

Slaw. — ^This is an American preparation of cabbage, 
and can be served both hot and cold ; in the former 
case it is a very nice vegetable entremet, in the latter 
it is a more or less recondite form of cabbiage salad. 

hot — Well wash a good white cabbage, 

using plenty of water for the purpose, shred it very 
fine (in America a special slicer is used), drain it 
thoroughly, place it in a pan, and for a quart of shredded 
cabbage pour in a good half pint of boiling water ; 
dust it all with half a teaspoonful of salt, cover down 
the pan, and let it boil till nearly tender, which it 
should be in about half an hour ; at the end of this 
time pour in a gill of milk and a teaspoonful of butter, 
and let it cook till this is all absorbed. Now turn 
it into a hot vegetable dish, and serve either with 
a Bearnaise sauce or with the following : Dissolve 
in a tablespoonful of best white vinegar a pinch 
each of mustard, flour, salt, and caster sugar, with a 
tiny pinch of cayenne, stir into this a well beaten 
whole egg, then add a teaspoonful of butter, and stir 
it in the bain marie till fairly thick, when you add 
half a gill of boiling milk, and use it. Some cooks 
use thin tomato sauce instead of the above. An- 
other way is to prepare the cabbage as above, and 
boil it, till perfectly tender, in fast-boiling salted 
water. When thoroughly cooked, drain of! all the 
water, stir into it a tablespoonful of butter, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, a dust each of cayenne and 
freshly-ground pepper, and from half to a gill o{ 
best vinegar, according to taste ; cover down the pan 



VEGETABLES 127 

and leave it at the side of the stove for five 
minutes or so till the sauce and the cabbage are 
well blended. 

Slaw, cold, — For this choose a good, firm head 
of cabbage, remove the outside and faded leaves, 
and shred it finely as before; steep it for an hour 
or so in very cold or iced water, then drain well, 
and serve either with a French oil and vinegar dressing, 
or with the hot sauce recommended for hot slaw, 
only using double the quantities there given and 
making the sauce in the usual way, and pouring it 
over the raw shred cabbage instead of mixing it all 
over the fire. 

Sorrel (Oseille), — ^This is such a wholesome vegetable 
that it is a great pity it is not more commonly used in 
this country. Abroad veal is seldom seen unless accom- 
panied by a puree of sorrel. It is best cooked with 
butter, preparing it thus : Pick it over well, nip off 
the stalks, and, if thick, tear the midrib from the 
leaves, tearing these also into shreds if large ; then 
well wash it in several waters, finally leaving it in 
a colander under a running tap for a little ; then 
drain, shake off most of the moisture, and put it in 
a pan with a dust of sugar and loz. of butter for each 
quart of picked sorrel, the moisture adhering to the 
latter being sufficient to cook it, with the butter. Let 
it cook till well reduced (it reduces a great deal), 
and when quite tender dust in a little fine flour, stir 
this over the fire till well mixed, when it must be 
all rubbed through a sieve, reheated, and blended 
with a Uttle more butter or some cream, or some 
good veal gravy, and, if liked, a little more sugar, 



128 VEGETABLES. 

and use. Sorrel may also be cooked by any re* 
given for spinach. Sorrel is one of the things t 
require specially to be used fresh, hence probal 
its unpopularity here, where there is not sufficie 
demand to ensure a constant fresh supply. 1 
soften the acid flavour objected to by some, use ha. 
and half sorrel and spinach, or one part spinach t( 
three of sorrel. If the sorrel is old, and consequently^ 
rather more acid, mix it in the same way with lettuce 
instead of spinach, and allow a little more caster 
sugar. 

Spinach (Epinards). — ^Pick over the spinach (about 
2 to 3lb.), removing all faded or imperfect leaves 
and anv coarse stalk. Well wash in two or three 
waters, then either put it on in a pan with a little 
water, or only the water adhering to the leaves after 
washing, and let it cook till tender, which takes from 
ten to fifteen minutes. Now drain well, and rub 
it through a sieve. Melt together loz. of butter 
with a teaspoonful of flour, till perfectly smooth, 
add this to the spinach with pepper, salt, and a little 
new milk or cream, or good gravy, stir it all well 
together till hot, and serve. Spinach improves 
by reheating, and in Prance a large quantity is cooked 
at a time (generally by the cr Emeries, from whom it 
may be bought ready for re-heating and finishing 
off). But to ensure success with spinach cooked thus, 
the vegetable when blanched should be well drained, 
pressed, and chopped, then sieved and finished off 
with butter or cream, or an addition of rich veal 
stock as preferred. (French cooks almost invariably 
stipulate for an extra allowance of butter when 



YEGETABLES. 129 

spinach is used.) When made thus into a puree 
it is served with croutons and poached eggs, or obufs 
mollets, as preferred. In England spinach is, after 
well washing, put on in a generous amount of boiling 
salted water, the leaves being pressed down from 
time to time to keep them covered whilst cooking. 
They are then strained, pressed, and finished off as 
before. Remember that the young leaves of nettles, 
beetroot, watercress, turnip tops, and even curly 
kale, are excellent treated as spinach. 

Spinach aux olives. — ^Take the requisite quantity 
of cold cooked spinach and stir it over the fire, season- 
ing it with a few drops of lemon juice, white pepper, 
salt, and butter, stirring in at the last a little cream, 
rich stock, or sauce, as preferred. Have ready as 
many square croutons of delicately fried bread as 
you have guests, pile each up with the hot puree, 
and set on the top of each a stoned olive filled with 
anchovy or ham butter, or a rolled fillet of anchovy, and 
serve very hot as a vegetable entremets or a garnish. 

au gratin. — ^Remove the stalks and centre 

string from a pound of spinach, put it on in cold, 
slightly salted water, bring this to the boil, then strain 
it well, pressing all the moisture out of it gently, 
so as not to break or mash the leaves. Well butter 
a fireproof dish, dust it with a mixture of fine white 
breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, pepper and 
salt, lay in the spinach at full length, sprinkling it, as 
you place it, with the same mixture of crumbs, cheese, 
&c. ; dust it lightly with coralline pepper, lay tiny 
morsels of butter all over it, cook it fifteen minutes 
in a moderate oven, and serve very hot.

Spinach greening. — ^This natural colouring is made 
in the same way as parsley greening, but does 
not keep as well. 

Souffles. — Prepare a pound of spinach 

as before, and, when sieved, put it into a basin with 
the yolks of three raw eggs, a pinch of white pepper, 
a dust of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of stiffly-whipped 
cream, and the whites of four eggs whisked to a stiff 
froth ; mix this all lightly together, pour the mixture 
into previously oiled, dried, and papered souffle cases, 
put a tiny pat of butter on each, and bake twelve 
to fifteen minutes in a moderate oven. Serve directly 
they are cooked with a dust of browned breadcrumbs 
on each. 

Sprue. — ^These are the long, thin green shoots that 
spring up on the asparagus roots when, after blanch- 
ing, these are allowed to grow naturally and uncovered. 
They are nicely flavoured, but of course are of no 
use for regular dishes, such as asperges en branches, 
&c., but they are excellent for garnishes, en petits 
pois, au gratin, en mayonnaise^ in sauce, or as a 
filling for omelets, &c. See Asparagus. 

Stachys Tuherifera. — See Artichoke, Japanese. 

Succotash, — ^This is a favourite American dish, 
usually made of a mixture of cooked Indian corn 
and beans of various kinds. This dish is usually 
procured in tins, or canned, in this country, when 
directions for preparing are given with it ; it makes 
a very nice entremets if curried, thus : Fry three or 
four tablespoonfuls of onion rings in butter till nicely 
browned, then in the same pan fry a full teaspoonful 
of curry powder; now add about a tablespoonful 



YEGETABLES. 131 

of fresh tomato pulp, moistening this all nicely with 
milk, stock, or water, and when slightly thickened 
stir in a tin of succotash, a teaspoonful of curry paste, 
and ^oz. of cornflour or creme de riz, and let it all 
simmer very gently together till quite hot and well 
blended, then serve in a wall of rice, adding at the 
last a squeeze of lemon juice and a tiny pat of butter. 

Tansy. — A strongly-flavoured, aromatic herb, for- 
merly much used for colouring and flavouring pud- 
dings, omelets, sauces, &c., the leaves being crushed 
to obtain the juice, which gave both aroma and colour 
to anything to which it was added. Seldom, if ever, 
seen nowadays, though formerly a tansy pudding 
had as definite a place in the cuUnary calendar as 
mince-pies or Simnel cakes. 

Tarragon (Estragon). — ^This herb is in request 
for flavouring, its delicate green colouring and 
peculiar but aromatic flavour making it a great 
addition to salads, sauces, &c., and an effective garnish, 
usually in conjunction with chervil. When green 
it should always be used fresh, as if the least stale 
the flavour is greatly diminished. For this reason, 
when it is not to be had fresh, tarragon vinegar (made 
by infusing the young green shoots in the best white 
vinegar) should be used, minced parsley or spinach 
giving the requisite green appearance. 

Thyme {Thym). — Of this horticulturally there 
are many varieties, but for the kitchen two suffice, 
the common garden thyme and the lemon thyme. 
Both are used fresh and dried, for flavourings, sauces, 
salads, and forcemeats, but for the latter purpose the 
lemon variety needs to be used with caution.

Tomato {T ornate), — ^The use of these has only 
become common of late years, tomato sauce alone 
having established itself here up to the latter half of 
the past century. Tomatoes may be baked, boiled, 
devilled, grilled, &c., or served en puree, or as an 
entremets dressed in a variety of ways. The great 
secret about tomatoes is not to leave them to cook 
over long, as this destroys the delicacy of their flavour 
entirely. If served raw they are excellent as a salad> 
either alone or in conjunction with other vegetables, 
whilst they play an important part in hors d*oeuvres 
and savouries. For eating raw, and indeed for 
most entremets, they should be peeled, and this is 
easily done if they are dipped for a moment (only) 
into scalding or boiling water, when the peel comes 
of! quite easily. But on no account leave them in the 
water, for soaking ruins them. 

baked. — ^Choose medium and even-sized 

tomatoes, remove the stalks, and halve them ; well 
butter a baking dish (using butter or well-clarified 
dripping, as you please), and put some more butter 
on and round the halves (using about 2oz. altogether 
for eight averaged-sized tomatoes), and bake for 
twenty minutes, more or less, according to size. 
If the tomatoes run large, peel them, slice them rather 
thickly, lay them in a single layer, touching but not 
overlapping, in a well-buttered baking dish, brush 
them over with a little liquified butter or dripping, 
dust with freshly-ground black pepper, a little siilt, 
and some finely-minced parsley, and bake for seven 
to eight minutes, serving them very hot, with a 
tiny dust of sugar (unless very ripe) and a few drops 



YEGETABLES. 133 

of lemon juice. When cooked thus they may be 
served as a garnish round roast meat, the Uquor 
in the baking-tin being poured over them at the last ; 
or they may be served separately thus : When cooked 
lift the slices on to a hot dish, and keep covered ; 
meanwhile, add a little stock or good meat gravy 
to the liquor in the baking-tin, let it just boil up, 
and serve poured over the tomatoes. These are very 
good if placed on croutons of fried bread cut to match, 
and dusted with minced chives and coralline pepper, 
the gravy poured over all, and, lastly, a cube of hot 
marrow set on each. Needless to say, these must 
be served at once, very hot. 

Tomatoes^ devilled. — Slice the tomatoes rather 
thickly after peeling them, coat them with butter 
or well-clarified dripping, with which you have 
rubbed up some mustard flour, dust generously 
vnXh freshly-ground black and coralline pepper, 
and bake or grill sharply for five to ten minutes, 
according to size and thickness. 

fried. — ^These make a deUcious accom- 
paniment to roast meat or fried bacon. Choose 
:small tomatoes (the so-called *' bird " kind, about 
the size of a large cherry are nicest), as whole and 
perfect as possible ; heat a little fat or butter in a pan 
(or use the bacon fat when the rashers have been 
lifted out), and toss the tomatoes in this, gently 
turning them now and again with a blunt skewer 
(if pricked with a fork, the juice and flavour all exudes) 
till they are glazed and cooked, which they should 
be in from eight to ten minutes, and serve. 

gratinees. — There are two or three ways 



134 VEGETABLES. 

of doing this ; for instance, peel and slice the tomatoes, 
and arrange them in a well-buttered dish, previously 
strewn with crumbs, grated cheese, pepper and salt, 
either in layers by themselves, or alternately with 
parboiled and sUced onion, cover these with grated 
cheese, breadcrumbs, pepper, salt, and minced chives 
or parsley, and repeat these layers till the dish is 
full, finishing with the crumbs, &c. ; put some morseb 
of butter over it all, and bake for twenty minutes or 
so. Or, again, choose large tomatoes, cut a thick 
slice off the top (or if very large, halve them), scoop 
out as much of the flesh as you can without endanger- 
ing the skins, and put the latter aside. Now fry 
a small tablespoonful of minced chives in ^oz. of 
butter, till nicely coloured, then add the scooped out 
pulp of half a dozen tomatoes, and stir it altogether 
over the fire till the tomatoes are cooked; then sieve 
it, add sufficient freshly-grated and seasoned white 
breadcrumbs to thicken it, mix to it the well-beaten 
yolks of two eggs for every three tomato cases, and fill 
the tomato cases with this mixture, dust them lightly 
with grated cheese, put a tiny pat of butter on each, 
and bake on a buttered baking-tin for ten minutes, 
and use. 

Tomato puree. — Break up six good tomatoes, 
and put them into a pan with 1 to l^oz. fresh butter, 
with a small quartered onion, a bouquet (thyme, 
parsley, bay-leaf, (fee), one clove, and enough cold 
water just to cover the tomatoes; add a little salt 
and some peppercorns, bring it gently to the boil, 
shaking the pan from time to time lest the pun'e 
should stick to the pan, and when tender enough sieve 



YEGETABLES. 135 

it ; remove the pips and the peel, rubbing the sieve 
well to extract every drop of pulp, leaving the pips 
and the skins quite dry, scrape the residue under 
the sieve, and add it to the rest of the puree, for this 
is the best part. Cook this uncovered, or the puree 
will be too thin. This puree, if made rather thick, 
and mixed with a little grated Parmesan cheese, 
minced chives, and coralline pepper, makes delicious 
tomato souffles^ according to the recipe given for 
spinach souffles. 

Tomatoes, stewed. — ^Peel, stalk, and slice as many 
tomatoes as you need, and lay them in a pan (enamelled 
for choice), with loz. of butter or delicately-clarified 
dripping for each ^Ib. of sliced tomato; cover the 
pan, and cook very slowly till tender, which they 
should be in about twenty minutes, then serve. If 
liked, the tomatoes need only be halved instead of 
sliced. 

stuffed. — ^Prepare the tomatoes as for 

tomates gratineeSy removing the pips and pulp with 
a silver spoon, and set these cases on a well-buttered 
baking dish. Mix the pulp, freed from pips, with 
breadcrumbs or cooked rice, minced or grated ham, 
tongue, or any meat, finely-minced shallot, thyme, 
marjoram, parsley, pepper, and ealt, and fill the 
cases with this mixture, piling it up well, shake a 
little salad oil, or put some morsels of butter over 
each, and bake for a few minutes. If liked, mush- 
rooms may be used instead of meat, whilst anchovies, 
capers, truffles, &c., can one and all be used as 
you please. The proportions are two tablespoonfuls 
of freshly-made white breadcrumbs and a teaspoonf ul 



136 YEGETABLES. 

of minced chives or shallot for each tablespoonful 
of ham or other flavouring. This is a very favourite 
and most useful dish, as all sorts of scraps can be 
used for it. Broken up cauliflower, asparagus, 
fish, (fee, can all be used instead of meat. Tomatoes 
may be cooked in so many ways that it is impossible in 
a book of this size to do more than give a few recipes ; 
but, given these, an intelligent cook will not find it 
hard to evolve other little dishes. It may be men- 
tioned that tomatoes blend admirably with macaroni, 
and are a great addition, quartered, to any cassercle 
and most stews. 

Tomato garnishes. — ^Tomatoes may be used in 
various ways for garnish. For instance, choose small 
ones, cut a slice off the stalk end, and with a silver 
spoon scoop out the pips, and a little of the pulp, 
then press back the flesh with the bowl of the spoon, 
season the inside lightly with pepper, a very little 
salt, oil, and a few drops of tarragon vinegar, minced 
parsley, and, if liked, chives, then fill up the centre 
with any nice mayonnaise to taste, putting on the 
top an olive stuffed with anchovy butter or a rolled 
anchovy fillet. These make an excellent garnish 
for cold roast meat. If larger tomatoes are used 
they may be scalded, peeled, and halved, the inner 
side being treated as above, and then filled up with 
any dainty salading to taste. For instance, with 
cold fowl, or a chaufroix of lamb cutlets, prepare 
the tomatoes thus, then fill them with asparagus 
points or young green peas tossed in mayonnaise 
sauce, and, if liked, set a plover's egg or a cube of 
foie gras truffe on the top of each. This last is, of 



VEGETABLES. 137 

course, not indispensable. Or a plain lettuce salad 
only, seasoned with a vinaigrette dressing, is very 
efEective served in this way. With cold game, fill up 
with a mushroom salad. Another pretty garnish may 
be made by cutting small unpeeled tomatoes with 
a sharp knife into sections the shape and size of the 
divisions of an orange, seasoning these with oil, 
tarragon vinegar, freshly-ground black pepper, salt, 
and minced-parsley, or green tarragon and chervil. 
These can be used alone or in a salad. Mind that 
for this the tomatoes are not over ripe or soft, or 
the appearance of the garnish will be spoilt. Some 
cooks fry such sections and serve them hot, dusted 
with pepper and salt, piled up as an accompaniment 
to roast mutton, &c. 

Truffles (Truffes). — ^These, in any soigne kitchen, 
should be used fresh or not at all. The bottled 
trujffles are practically useless, as their flavour has 
almost entirely perished, and there is nothing left but 
a leathery, indigestible substance, which, but for 
fashion, we should never dream of trpng to eat. 
Of truffles there are two kinds, the black or common 
one, and the Piemontais or white truffle, seldom 
if ever seen in this country. If bought fresh, truffles 
should be very carefully washed and brushed with 
a good stiff nail brush, to remove every trace of earth 
and sand from the rough skin, then peel them, put 
them on in a pan with sufficient chicken stock and 
sherry, in equal quantities, to cover them, a table- 
spoonful of butter or the fat off rich soup, an onion, 
and a bouquet ; let this all cook gently together for 
fifteen minutes in a closely-covered pan. Now 



138 VEGETABLES. 

turn them out into a basin, and leave them to get 
cold in their own liquor. They can now be trimmed 
if necessary, but remember that all such trimniings, 
together with the stock in which they were cooked, 
must be saved, as the former are excellent for force- 
meats, (fee, whilst the latter is perfect for sauces, 
gravies, &c. Never use the rough outer skin. Other 
ways are the following : 

Truffles, steamed. — After washing and peeling 
the truffles as above, fill the lower part of a steamer 
with two parts water to one of sherry, arrange the 
truffles on the steamer, and steam for an hour. Serve 
in a napkin. The proper truffes a la serviette^ are 
cooked when washed and brushed (but not peeled) 
by wrapping each in a sheet of wet paper, and burying 
them in hot wood ashes for an hour, when they are 
taken out of the papers and served in a napkin. 

a Vltalienne. — ^Well wash, peel, and slice 

some nice fresh truffles, lay these in a buttered fire- 
proof dish, strew them with finely-minced parsley, 
chives, or shallot, pepper, and a Uttle salt; pour 
enough best salad oil over them to moisten all 
nicely, then cover them down closely, set them in 
the oven for fifteen to twenty minutes, and serve 
with a squeeze of lemon juice over them at the last. 

au champagne. — ^Line a stewpan with 

sliced ham, lay the washed and peeled truffles on 
this, with some sliced onion, peppercorns, cloves, 
and salt, pour in sufficient champagne to cover all 
this generously, just bring it to the boil, and draw 
it to the side and let it all simmer gently for an hour 
or more ; then lift the truffles out carefully, and 



VEGETABLES. 139 

serve in a napkin. The liquor makes delicious sauce 
for cutlets, &c. 

Turnips (Navels). — Of these there are practically 
(for culinary purposes) two kinds, the English and 
the French, the latter being the most expensive, 
and, according to a good many cooks, possessing 
the most flavour, but this I venture to believe is a 
good deal due to their never being seen on the market 
save when young. As a matter of fact, once they 
are past their first youth, turnips should, according 
to connoisseurs, never be served save mashed. If 
old, turnips should be rather thickly peeled, but 
when really young it is sufficient to well wash and 
scrape them. To boil them put them on in slightly 
salted water, let this reboil, then draw it to the side 
of the stove, and let them simmer gently till done, 
which, for young ones, will take from twenty to thirty 
minutes, whilst older ones require from forty-five 
minutes to ai> hour and a half. These latter may 
be halved or quartered, according to their size, and 
then naturally take more or less time to cook, according 
to their size. 

mashed, — Cook the turnips as above, 

drain them and sieve them, put on this pulp with ji 
pat of butter, pepper, salt, and, if liked, grated nutmeg, 
stir them well over a slow fire till the puree is suffi- 
ciently thick and dried, moistening it if necessary 
with a little new milk or cream. 

sauced. — New turnips boiled as above 

can, when well drained, be served with either of the 
following sauces : First stir together loz. of butter t 
and a dessertspoonful of flour till smooth, season 



140 VEGETABLES. 

with pepper, salt, a dust of sugar, and a very little 
grated nutmeg if liked, moisten with a gill or so 
(according to quantity) of new milk or cream, let this 
just boil up, lay in the turnips, let it simmer altogether 
for a few minutes, and serve as Navels a la creme. 
If you add to the above sauce the yolk of an egg beaten 
up in one or two spoonfuls of cream, they become 
Navels a la Poulelle. Or, if preferred, tomato, 
bechamel, veloute, or cheese cream sauce (given for 
artichokes) may be used in the same way with 
advantage. Turnips cooked in this way must 
be small and even, both in shape and size ; failing 
this, however, they should be trimmed into little 
even-sized cones or pear shapes, but for ordinary 
purposes it is best to avoid this, as it entails a good 
deal of waste. 

Turnips, glazed. — Choose some new turnips as 
above, or, if preferred, cut them into quarters, shaping 
these a little like the sections of an orange ; parboil 
them in salted water for five or ten minutes, then 
drain them thoroughly, and place them in a well- 
buttered saute pan, sprinkle them with plenty of 
powdered loaf sugar, set the pan on the fire, and, 
as soon as the turnips begin to colour, moisten with 
a little clear stock, season with pepper, salt, and, 
if needed, a little more sugar, let them stew gently 
till quite tender, and serve with their sauce over 
and round them. 

Turnip Tops. — These, in season in the early spring, 
may be cooked by any of the recipes given for spinach, 
but take a little longer to cook. They are excellent 
an gralin. It must be remembered in cooking these 



YEGETABLES. 141 

that a large quantity of water must be allowed in 
the boiling, as this removes the bitter taste some- 
times noticed in this regetable, especially when 
they are no longer in their first youth. Old turnip 
tops should never be used under any circumstances, 
but if by any accident they must be cooked when 
slightly passed their prime, they are immensely 
improved by being blanched first for five to ten 
minutes or so in boiUng water, then pouring this 
away, rinsing the turnip tops in cold water, draining 
them well, and finishing them ofi in fresh boiling 
salted water. Late in the season the large stalks 
of these tops are exceUent if blanched and cooked 
like celery or salsify. 

Vegetable Marrow (Courges a la moelle). — ^These 
vegetables are, in this country, usually served far 
too old. To be eaten in perfection they should not 
be larger than a fairly large duck's egg ; in this state 
they need not be peeled, a great advantage, as, being; 
so watery, directly they are cut marrows lose a great 
deal both of their moisture and of their flavour ; if 
chosen small, they should be put on in boiling salted 
water, boiled fast for fifteen minutes or so, and served 
whole with maitre d*h6tel, tomato, or cheese cream 
sauce to taste, and, if cold, make a delicious salad 
with a vinaigrette sauce. 

baked. — When baked, vegetable marrows 

are almost always served stuffed, either with meat, 
fish, or any of the savoury stuffings recommended 
for aubergines, tomatoes, &c. Cut an average sized 
vegetable marrow in half, remove the pips and the 
pulp adhering to them, fill each half with the stuffings 



142 VEGETABLES. 

then put these together again, wrap them up in a 
well-buttered paper, and tie the marrow into shape, lay 
this on a buttered baking-tin, cover down closely with 
another tin, and bake ; when ready lift them out 
carefully, dish them on a hot dish after removing 
the papers, and serve with tomato sauce and some 
good clear gravy. The time' these will take to bake 
must necessarily depend on the size of the marrow. 
Another way is to halve the marrows lengthways, 
remove the pips, &c., and parboU them in salted 
water, with an onion stuck with two or three cloves, 
and a bouquet ; now drain them carefully, set the 
halves in a generously buttered baking-tin, and fill 
them up with farce to taste, dust this with freshly- 
grated breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan, minced 
parsley, pepper, and salt, cover with a buttered 
paper, and bake for twenty minutes or so. 

Vegetable Marrow au gratin. — ^Peel and parboil a 
couple of medium sized marrows, quartering these 
lengthways, drain them carefully, and arrange them in a 
well-buttered dish (previously rubbed with cut shallot) ; 
sprinkle them generously with grated Parmesan 
cheese, fresh breadcrumbs, coralline pepper, salt, and 
a little grated nutmeg, put some morsels of butter 
all over the top, and bake for about twenty minutes. 

It is manifestly impossible, in a book of this size, 
to give even a tithe of the ways in which vegetables 
can be cooked, and especially is this the case with 
vegetable marrows, which can be sent to table in 
almost as many ways as potatoes can be, so space 
can only be afforded for two recipes seldom seen 
in this country. 



VEGETABLES. 143 

Courges an jus. — Mince finely a small piece of fat 
bacon, and fry it with a small minced onion, season- 
ing it with pepper, salt, and minced sweet herbs ; 
when the onion begins to colour lay in the marrow 
(which should have been peeled, the pips removed, 
and the whole quartered lengthways); pour in 
enough good brown stock to cover the marrow 
thoroughly, and let it stew very gently till tender. 
Now dish the marrow and keep it hot whilst 
you strain the sauce and thicken it with a little 
brown roiLx (or butter and flour cooked together till 
perfectly blended and smooth, and brought to a 
Ught coffee colour), pour this thickened sauce over 
the marrow, and serve very hot. 

Courges en fricot. — Peel and seed a fairly large 
vegetable marrow, and cut it into strips one and 
a half inches long by three-quarters of an inch; 
put these on a plate, strew plenty of finely-powdered 
salt over them, cover them with another plate, 
and let them stand for about two hours ; now 
lift the plates together, and pour off all the 
water you can, then dry the strips in a clean cloth, 
being careful not to break them ; turn them into 
another well-floured cloth, and toss them about 
lightly to coat each piece evenly with flour. Put 
a few of these pieces at a time into the frying basket, 
and boil in very hot fat. Directly the strips begin 
to colour and to crisp, lift them out on to a sheet of 
kitchen paper, and let them drain in front of the 
fire till the rest of the pieces are all cooked 
in the same way; dust with fine salt and coralline 
pepper, and send to table with a quartered lemon and 



144 VEGETABLES. 

brown bread and butter. Vegetable marrows ai 
very good mashed, and in that condition are extreme! 
nice cooked Uke Duchesse potatoes, or fried in battel 

Vegetable macedoine. — ^This is a very favourit 
French garnish, and is used both hot and cold. Th 
vegetables are cooked separately in salted boiling 
water, then drained, and tossed in a little butte 
and a morsel of sugar till nicely glazed, when the; 
are piled up in a shape, and put in the centre of th 
dish as a garnish to cutlets, &c. Another way k 
when parboiled, to mix them with just enough rathe: 
thick sauce (white or brown, according to the urn 
you wish to make of them) to make them adhere 
and toss them over the fire in this till quite hot, anc 
serve them as before. A macedoine should contaii 
four different kinds of vegetables, and frequently doe* 
consist of many more. French beans, flageolets 
haricots, turnips, asparagus points, peas, celeriae 
broccoli, cauliflower, &c., can all be used, and the 
colours should be nicely assorted. Root vegetables, 
such as carrots or turnips, &c., should be eithei 
cut into dice, slices, or small olive shapes, whilst the 
cauliflower is broken up into tiny sprays. 

cold. — ^Prepare the vegetables exactl}; 

as above, and leave them till cold, then mix them 
with just liquid aspic, or any mayonnaise aspic tc 
taste, and either mould them or serve them piled 
up rockily in the centre of a dish. There is another 
garnish of this sort known as the Jardinierey and 
it is often difficult to distinguish between the two, 
as many cooks seem to use the two words inter- 
changeably ; but I believe, strictly speaking, this 



VEGETABLES. 145 

vegetable garnish is called a mao'doine, when moulded 
or heaped up altogether, whilst if the different veget- 
ables are served round the dish to be garnished, in 
separate little heaps, each kind by itself, it is known 
as a Jardiniere, 

Vegetable souffle. — Almost any kind of vegetable 
may be made into a souffle, if boiled till quite soft, 
carefully dried in a clean cloth, and then sieved ; 
to half a pint (a breakfastcupful) of this puree add 
two tablespoonfuls of any rich and thick sauce to 
taste, the yolks of two eggs, with pepper and salt, 
and at the last the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
very stiff froth ; pour into one large, or several small, 
paper souffle cases, and bake in a hot oven for twenty 
minutes for the large case, or ten to twelve minutes 
for the small ones, and serve at once. These souffles 
may be varied almost indefinitely by using different 
flavourings ; for instance, grated Parmesan, coralline 
pepper, minced parsley or chives, &c., may be all 
used, or two kinds of vegetables may be mixed, making 
a puree with one and stirring in the other in cubes or 
sprays, according to its nature. Thus a puree of 
tomatoes mixed with broken-up cauliflower, and 
seasoned with coralline pepper and grated cheese, 
makes a very palatable vegetable entremets. 

for soup. — ^The question of the proportions 

of vegetables to be used in soup making is one that 
often perplexes novices, so we may here give the 
ideal proportions observed by M. Gouffe, and other 
first-rate chefs. For each pound of meat in stock- 
making allow 3^oz. each of carrots, turnips, and 
large onions, 4 to 5oz. leeks, rather under ^oz. of celery, 

L 



146 VEGETABLES. 

and two-thirds of an ounce of parsnip. These last are 
not indispensable, but may be replaced by extra carrots ; 
the leeks, also, if not at hand, may be replaced by an 
extra Spanish onion or so ; whilst in winter the pro- 
portion of turnip may be reduced by fully one-third. 
These proportions are for pot au feu, clear soup, or 
consomme. 

Watercress {Cresson). — ^This is seldom used here 
save in the raw state, and if well washed and nicely 
seasoned with oil, vinegar, pepper, and salt, makes 
a decidedly praiseworthy salad, alone or mixed with 
other salading. But it also is very good if cooked, 
and, in Germany especially, is much liked, both as 
a vegetable entremets and as soup. 

tl VaUerrtande. — Well wash the cress in 

several waters, then chop it lightly; stir together 
over the fire 2oz. each of butter and flour till per- 
fectly blended and delicately browned, now moisten 
it with half a pint of water (or weak stock) and stir 
it all till it boils ; season it with white pepper, salt, 
a grate of nutmeg, and sufficient lemon juice, or 
vinegar, to acidulate it pleasantly, lay in the cress, 
let it boil up well, and serve. 

stewed. — ^Pick over and well wash the 

cress, then boil it in plenty of boiling salted water till 
nearly cooked, when it must be lifted out, and drained 
on a colander to remove all the water possible. Mean- 
while melt l^oz. of butter, then lay in the cress, 
dredge it lightly with a little sifted flour, and stir 
it for ten minutes over the fire ; now add half a pint 
of good stock, season as before, and cook it all for

very hot, garnished with croutons, or fleurons of 
cheese pastry, and quartered hard-boiled eggs. 

Yams (Ignames). — Of these there are several 
kinds, the white, or '* floury " ; the Guinea ; the hard ; 
the yellow, or "affoo"; the negro; the Japanese; 
and the Indian yam. The white yam is generally 
considered the best. These tubers are in appearance 
something between Jerusalem artichokes and potatoes, 
particularly the sweet potato or batata^ which they 
greatly resemble, though actually belonging to 
different species. They can, however, be cooked 
in the same way. 

boiled. — ^Peel them, and wash them well 

in cold water to remove the slime which is apt to 
cling to them ; now put them on in cold water, and 
when half cooked, add salt to taste. They take 
about the same time to cook as potatoes. 

roasted. — ^Well wash and lightly scrape, 

but do not peel the yams, then bake in a hot oven 
till the skin is crisp, and the inside soft. Serve as 
they are in a napkin, sending butter and pepper 
to table with them. Or, when cooked, they may 
be quickly peeled, and coarsely sieved and served 
like *' snow potatoes." Yams may also be boiled, 
and mashed with an egg, a little butter, pepper, 
and salt, and served plain; or made into balls and 
fried like potato duchesses ; or balls of the mashed yam 
may be dipped in batter and fried ; or the yams may 
be washed, peeled, sUced, and fried till crisp in hot 
fat ; or they may be devilled, by slicing them as before, 
buttering both sides well, dusting these thickly with 
salt, cayenne, and freshly-ground black pepper,

and broiled; or, lastly, they may be parbi 
served sliced in curry sauce ; or, when parb 
into straws and fried in hot fat. Indee< 
may be cooked in most of the ways ad\ 
potatoes.

- PREFACE. 

\ Little, if any, originality is claimed for the 
^^ollowing recipes, most of which have appeared in 
iJthe Cookery columns of the Queen during the 
^5^ast eight or nine years, from whence they have 
^been collected at the request of many readers of 
\^he Queen, to save reference to back numbers not 
^ always within reach. Additional recipes have, how- 
-^ever, been given, to bring this little work as much 
f up to date as possible; but all these, like the 
^ previous ones, have been carefully tested, and are 
all (as I know from practical experience) weU within 
the capacity of any ordinary " good plain cook," 
gifted with fair intelligeoce and a little goodwill. 
I desire also to take this opportunity of acknow- 
ledging my indebtedness to the various authors of 
standard foreign cookery books, and also to offer 
my grateful thanks to Mrs. A. B. Marshall, and 
several other well-known chefs, whose kindness, 
has so materially helped and rendered possible my 
work in these last years.

CHAPTER I. 

ORIGIN AND KIND. 

Not so many years ago an ice pudding was looked 
upon as a triumpli of culinary art, that even the 
average good professed cook would as soon have 
thought of trying to make, as of trying to fly ; whilst 
the ordinary ices, served on plates at ball suppers, 
&c., came as a matter of course from the con- 
fectioner's. Now, however, thanks to various im- 
provements in freezers, ice caves, &c., ice-making 
has become less of a secret, and very few really good 
cooks would confess to being ignorant of its 
preparation; whilst almost every house-mistress 
intent on a smart dinner would insist on an iced 
entremet of some kind, even if she did not also have 
ices at dessert as well. 

Both ice and snow have been used for cooling 
food, both liquid and solid, for centuries, but the ice, 
as we understand it, has not been known for more 
than three centuries at the outeiv^e, Is^.'^T^vsjL^ifc^''^ 



2 ICES. 

all events, such ices did not become at all well known 
till the reign of Louis XIV., when a Florentine, 
Procopio by name, introduced them into Paris some- 
where about 1660, though probably in Italy they 
were in existence earlier; at all events the half- 
frozen ice of snow-like consistency, known to this 
day in Italy as a " granito," was common enough 
even then. The "sorbet,** or semi-fluid ice strongly 
flavoured with alcohol, which has in modem days 
succeeded to the position formerly held by pimch, is 
said to be the lineal descendant of the " sherbet," so 
dear to the Oriental, even in the days of the Crusades. 
Sherbet then was a mixture of more or less sweetened 
fruit juice or pulp, acidulated with lemon juice and 
chilled with snow. Presmnably early in their 
connection with India, the British merchants 
appear to have adopted the sherbet, only adding 
to it a modicum of spirit of some kind ; whence its 
name was changed from sherbet to punch, said to 
be derived from a Sanscrit word meaning five, 
having reference to the five elements that entered 
into its composition ; these five parts were water, 
spice, sugar, spirit, and lemon juice, for the pleasant 
acid obtained from the tamarind or the lemon were 
then preferred to other fruits, probably because the 
Europeans dropped the custom of chilling their 
sherbet, using hot water instead of the refrigerants 
(and thereby incidentally in great measure destroying 
its wholesomeness), especially when it made its way 
to Northern climes, where it was received with 
effusion as a hot drink, specially suited to the cold, 
humid atmosphere of the Northern winter. We all 



ORIGIN AND KIND. 3 

know the old French proverb that teaches us that 
Fashion is a revolving wheel ; and this holds true of 
punch, which was again transformed into a frozen 
mixture, though the spirit prevented its setting as 
much as the ordinary ice. It began as a lemon 
water ice, flavoured with various kinds of spirit to 
taste, from whence it took its name, and gradually 
all kinds of fruit water ice replaced the original lemon 
water. 

Of ices there are a great varieiy ; for instance, the 
ordinary cream and water ices, the iced pudding, 
the plomhiere, the bonibe, the fromage, the iced 
souffle, the mousse, the moscovite, the charlotte 
glacee, &c. ; which all denote variety, though truly 
but little real difference in their composition. Of 
these, further particulars will be given later. 

It may, however, be mentioned that the plomhiere 
and the frontage are now rather out of date ; the 
homhe, in its original form, being also old-fashioned, 
though its name is still seen on menus. Originally 
it was introduced by Francatelli, it is said, and was 
then made in the shape of a shell or bomb, the flame 
that is emitted by a live shell, being reproduced in 
spun sugar. This grim reminiscence of war declined 
in favour after the Crimean campaign ; now, though 
the name still remains, the shape is altered, as will 
be seen by Fig. 1, and almost all tall conical moulds 
are called by this name nowadays. The plomhiere 
derived its name from the metal of which the mould 
was made originally, namely lead (plomh), and the 
term was applied rather indiscriminately to the 
mould and to the pail or sorhetiere in which tlaa \ftfe

was made. The fromage, or cheese, was a plain 
mould divided internally by strips of metal, allowing 
of differently coloured and flavoured ices being 
slipped in, the strips being then removed, the whole 
lightly pressed tc^ether, and frozen as a whole. (If

was, however, sometimes served as a block of one sort 
of ice only, generally sweetened, frozen, pure cream, 
and used as an accompaniment to fruit.) The modem 
version of this ice is the Neapolitan, a brick-shaped 
mould (gee Fig. 2) filled in layers with differently 
tinted and flavoured icea, then tuLmed out, and sLced

across so as to show tlie stripes. Tlie iced pudding 
is a more or less ricli custard mixed witli preserved 
fruits, &c., packed in a mould and frozen; this of 
course may be of almost any shape. The iced 
charlotte is, as its name implies, made in the 
ordinary plain charlotte mould, lined with biscuits, 
wafers, slices of Genoa or other rich cake, &c., and 
filled up with any ice to taste. A very modem ver- 
sion of this is the gateau glace, when a rich cake of 
some kind is hollowed out and served with a fruit

garnish and a filling of any sort of ice. The iced 
souffle is a very rich form of very light whipped 
custard, placed in a papered souffle mould, allowed to 
set in the ice cave, and finally served with the outside 
paper removed to give it bhe appearance of having 
risen (see Fig. 3, for the papering of the mould). 
The mousse is made of the same preparation as is 
used for the iced souffle, only it is moulded instead of 
being put into the souffle case. The difference be- 
tween this and the ordinary ice pudding is that in the 
latter case the ice to be used is first frozen in the 
freezer till of the consistency oi 'vet^ >2>K:L0«.\«i^iyst^

and is then put into tlie mould, care being taken to 
press tlie ice well into the shape of the mould so that 
when turned out the outline should be clear and 
distinct ; whereas the souffle or mousse is mixed and 
poured at once into the dish in which it is to be 
served. Lastly, there are the moscovite, and the 
spongada. The former is a simpler form of iced 
pudding stiffened with a small proportion of 
isinglass or best leaf gelatine, which is, however, 
never actually frozen, though it is iced till as cold as it 




Fi>. 3. 

Is possible to get it. It is therefore well adapted for 
use in households where freezing conveniences are 
not available. The spongada is a very light form of 
whipped cream ice, common in Italy, but seldom, if 
ever, seen in this country, save when it is occasionally- 
used to fill up a mould lined with ordinary cream or 
water ice. Besides these there is the parfaif, which 
is very much the same as the spongada, only frozen a 
little more stiffly, the latter being more like frozen 
froth, whence its other name of spumante or 
foanung. 



ORIGIN AND KIND. 7 

Formerly, the process of freezing was a very 
troublesome and difficult one, requiring more practice 
and skill than could be easily attained by any one 
who could not give up all their time to it, and it is 
to this we owe the «lifficulty and exfense formerly 
connected with ices, and icing generaDy. Formerly 
ice was made in ice-pots or sorbetieres, made of 
pewter, which were stood in pails containing a 
mixture of ice and salt, the ice-pot being so fitted in 
that it could be made to revolve by hand ; the ice as 
it congealed at the sides of the pot being scraped into 
the centre with a spoon or spatula. This naturally 
was a work of time, and tiring at that, as the pot 
was open to allow of this ice scraping ; then, when 
the mixture had at last frozen to the consistency of 
batter, it was packed into a mould with a tight- 
fitting Hd, the edges of which were then " luted ' or 
pasted down with butter or fat of some kind to 
prevent any possible contamination from the salt 
with which the ice was mixed. How frequently this 
precaution failed many people can doubtless 
remember, as they recall the curious salty taste 
so frequently and unaccountably present in ices. 
This mould thus luted was then buried for a time in 
the ice and salt mixture until it should have solidified 
properly, and be fit to turn out. Necessarily much 
experience was required, and the process did not 
come within the limits of even the professed cook, 
who had so much besides to attend to. However, 
the difficidty has been overcome by various inven- 
tions, both British and foreign, notably American, 
and in consequence the populaxit^ oi \r«^ ^sASsa^

ilishes has been laJ^l^ increased; especially when the 
invention hj Mrs. A. B. Marshall of the ice cave 
alt(^ther did awar with the troublesome procesa of 
burying the moulded ice out of sight and reach 
PersonaUj, and speaking from much experience, the 
freezing tub and ice cave, brought out by Mrs. A. B. 
MarshaU, the well-known cookery teacher, appears to 
me the simplest and most practical. Like most of 




Fig 4 

the newer freezers, this freezing tub possesses an 
automatic fan inside, nhich, as the tub revolves as the 
handle is turned, keeps the ice in motion and scrapes 
it up from the sides and bottom, mixing it all till 
evenlyand smoothly blended. The chief point about it 
is the shallowness of the tub, which permits of a 
larger and thinner surface being exposed to the 
freezing medium ; thereby reducing the time it takes 
to freeze a given quantity of ice to such a minimum

show the freezing tub in its entirety, and in section, 
showing how the stationary fan scrapes up the film

tub, as the tub itself rotates by the motion of the

mixture under the pan. The tiny door at (a) in

The interstices shown in Fig. 7 between the outer 
walls of the cave and the inner metal casing, and in 
the lid, off ready for ehai^ng, are filled up with a 
misture of two parts ice to one part salt, which 
rapidly reduces the temperature of the inner cave to 




32 degrees of frost, at which point it will stay for 
several hours ; whilst of course if the cave ia care- 
fully recharged at intervals this temperature can be 
preserved almost indefinitely. The great convenience

Then again there is a charming little freezer brought 
out by Meaare. E. E. Roberts and Son (Fig. 8), at 
HO low a price as to bring it within the reach of any 
one. and bo simple in couatruction as to enable even 
a child to use it. So that really nowadaye, ice- 
making has been thrown open to the plainest of 
plain cooks, and its dif&ciiltiea reduced to almost 
nothing. 

The chief points to bear in mind in using any or all 
of these freezers, are, strict attention to the directions 



given in every case, and the moat scrupuloua clean- 
liness. 

To obtain fuU success, attention must be paid to 
the charging. The ice used should be weighed, and 
the proportion of salt mixed with it also carefully 
measured, and the two should not be mixed 
haphazard. The ice should be broken up into small 
knobs, aa even in size and shape as anyway possible, 
a layer of ice being then put in and then a layer of 
salt, proceeding thus till 'the whole ia used, and the 



ORIGIN AND KIND. 13 

two are perfectly blended, the whole being then well 
shaken together to pack it closely. In large house- 
holds where ices are in constant use, ice crushers, 
which crush the ice blocks into equal knobs are in 
request, but in smaller establishments the following 
will be found the most convenient method. Lay 
the ice on a piece of clean sacking or house-flannel, 
and chip off the pieces with an ice pricker or a 
mallet ; or else throw a flap of the flannel over the 
ice, and crush it up with a hammer. In Marshall's 
ice cave there is a screw plug fixed to both the body 
and the door of the machine, by which the melted 
ice, brine, &c., can be removed, while the machine 
can be re-charged without opening the inner cave in 
which the ice or material to be frozen is placed. By 
this means all chance of tainting the ice by the salt 
of the freezing mixture is utterly avoided, and there 
is no need to go to the expense of tightly closed 
pewter moulds, such as were required by the old 
method of burying the ice pudding, &c., in the 
freezing mixture. Moreover, thanks to the ice cave, 
souffles glaces are as easy to make as any other form 
of ice pudding. 

When the freezing mixture has been duly con- 
sidered, attention must next be bestowed on the 
materials to be frozen. For cream or custard ices it 
may be reckoned that 4oz. of sugar to the pint 
of custard is the fair average ; but this must to some 
extent depend on the fruit of which the ice is to be 
composed, therefore it is better to trust somewhat to 
one's palate, bearing in mind that freezing reduces 
the sweetness. Another thing to TeiCLea^x\^'*^^ 



14 ICES. 

in freezing, the material to be frozen expands in the 
process, therefore allowance for this should be made. 
In fact to obtain a quart of ice a vessel of a gaUon 
capacity is the safest. 

Lastly, when the ices have been made and turned 
out, special attention must be bestowed on the 
utensils used, which should be carefully washed and 
rinsed out, to remove any trace of the brine, which 
will otherwise inevitably rust the machine hopelessly. 
Especially is this the case with Messrs. E. Roberts* 
pretty little machine, which in gratitude for the 
modesty of its price, and the simplicity and success 
of its action, well deserves the attention which will 
preserve its usefulness. From experience, I know 
that, fairly treated, it compares favourably with 
many higher priced machines ; and, if lacking (natur- 
ally), the infinite variety obtainable with my favourite 
Marshall's freezer, and ice cave, will yet enable 
modest housewives to produce extremely good plain 
ices and sorbets, not to mention the form of ice- 
puddings kuown as Moscovites. 



CHAPTEE II. 

PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 

The ordinary ices, served in cups or plates, at 
receptions, balls, confectioners, &c., possess mucli 
greater variety than many persons imagine, even 
granted that they realise the gradations of the 
ordinary cream (?) ice ; from the delicate variety 
obtainable at a first-rate confectioners, to the awful 
" hokey-pokey " of the Italian ice-cream vendor at 
street comers, the delight of the street Arab, and the 
horror of the microbe and bacillus hunter. The 
latter compound, it may be observed in passing, is by 
no means so deadly a concoction as many people 
fancy, or infant mortality in our large towns 
would stand at a considerably higher average than it 
even actually does. The actual component parts are 
harmless enough, egg powder, skim or Swiss milk, 
corn-flour, and cheap sugar being the principal in- 
gredients ; the danger comes in with the water and 
ice used. One need hardly dwell on the unsavoury 
character of the latter, as if properly managed it 
does, or should, not affect the ice appreciably, but the 
water is a serious question ; and a still more serious 
one is the ignorance of even the ixio^t T\\^Tx\a\jiJisNx^ 



16 ICES. 

elements of sanitation that marks the worthy 
manufacturer of such cheap luxuries. 

To start with the two chief kinds, the Italian, or more 
properly the Neapolitan, and the American. The 
first is produced bj preparing a more or less rich 
custard, which is cooked without being allowed to 
boil, until on stirring it with a spoon the mixture 
will coat the latter thinly. It is then allowed to cool, 
when the flavouring essences, fruit pulps, liqueurs, 
&c., are added, the whole is sieved, and when cold is 
placed in the freezer. 

For the custards, you can use eight egg yolks and 
4oz. caster sugar to the pint of cream ; or, four egg 
yolks to the pint of single cream or new milk, and 
3oz. to 4oz. of caster sugar, with the whites whipped 
to a stiff froth with a tiny pinch of salt (this is made 
somewhat differently from the usual way, as the 
egg yolks are beaten up with the sugar till light, then 
lightly and quickly mixed in the stiffly whipped 
whites, and finally stirred over the fire with the milk 
till it thickens) ; then there is a still simpler kind 
made with a pint of milk, one well whisked egg, an 
ounce or so of sugar, and a tablespoonful of corn- 
flour ; and lastly there is a wonderful production 
made by stirring an ounce or so of cornflour till 
smooth in a little cold milk, then adding loz. to 2oz. 
of sugar and enough skim milk to make up a pint 
altogether ; let this boil together for five or six 
minutes at least, till perfectly smooth, and use when 
cold. This is of course not custard properly speaking, 
but it answers very fairly well, especially if about 
^oz, of leaf gelatine be dissolved in the mixture. A 



PLAIN ICES, CRBAM AND WATER. 17 

tablespoonful of Swiss milk dissolved in the milk 
naturallj adds considerably to the richness. 

For tiie American ice creams no custard at all is 
used, good thick cream being substituted. This form 
of ice is made in two ways ; the cream is whipped till 
very stiff, sweetened to taste, and frozen for a little, 
the flavouring essence, fruit pulp, or liqueur, is then 
added, and the whole frozen till dry. (This cream 
increases greatly in bulk in the freezing, becoming 
from one-fourth to one- third more ; but it must be 
remembered that this kind deteriorates very quickly, 
and therefore is not so good if it has to stand any 
time.) The second method is to scald the cream, by 
placing the vessel containing it in another, three 
parts full of cold water, and when this outer water 
boils up the cream is ready. K the cream itself is 
allowed to boil it loses its power of expansion ; but 
the scalding in the bain-marie does not interfere 
with this, whilst giving a smoother, less raw flavour, 
than ordinary cream would produce. 

Lastly, there is the modem process by which both 
these methods are combined ; the custard is cooked, 
cooled, flavoured, and then haK frozen, and lastly, a 
portion of whipped cream, varying from one- quarter 
to one-half the bulk of custard used is stirred in with 
the flavouring mixture, and the freezing is finished. 
Ice thus made, though not as Hght and fresh-tasted 
as the ice made with whipped cream only, is yet 
much richer and lighter than the ordinary custard- 
cream ice. Ice making is an easy process nowadays, 
compared with what it used to be ; still, like every- 
thing else, it requires care, and aLUje^\A.crcL \3a»i&\> \ife. 



18 ICES 

paid to a few points. First, never put the custard or 
cream into the freezer whilst warm, for if you do it 
will most probably curdle or granulate a fatal 
mistake, as properly made ice should always be 
perfectly smooth and even in texture. Moreover, 
cold custard involves less time, work, and ice. Be 
careful as to the proportion of sugar used, bearing in 
mind that freezing reduces the sweetening power of 
sugar ; if too much sugar be used the ice will not 
freeze properly; if too little is used, it will freeze 
quite hard and rocky. Again, in freezing, the ice, if 
to be moulded, needs to reach the consistency of 
batter, but if to be used plain it must be frozen till 
quite dry and hard ; the longer it will have to stand 
the stiff er it should be frozen. It is easy to tell how 
the freezing is progressing as the crank gets gradually 
harder to turn, as the ice stiffens. Ices shoiQd not 
be frozen too quickly, as they then freeze unevenly 
and will be coarse-grained ; to get the best effect the 
machine should be worked steadily and evenly. One 
more point to be noticed, and one that applies to 
every kind of ice, and that is the need for strict 
attention to cleanliness in everything that concerns 
ices and ice-making. It is almost in every case 
better to add the sugar required in the form of 
syrup (for a recipe for this see chapter on "Odds 
and Ends ") rather than of plain sugar, water ices 
being specially improved by syrup. 

All kinds of ices can be made with either jam, or 

liqueur or fruit syrups, according to what you have, 

and of course, though generally lacking in the 

delicacy of flavour given by ixeaVi iTrntA^"^! ^^^ very

conyenient, extremelj palatable, and distisctlj more 
economical than the fresh fruit. The proportions 
are half a pound of jam to the quart of cream, or 
custard, according to the richness jou wish for ; but 
if cream is used the jam should certainly be rubbed 
through a sieve, which for the commoner kinds is not 
so necessary ; the juice of a lemon and a few drops of 
vanilla should in every case be added to the jam. 
(Vanilla, by the way, brings out all fruit flavours 
most wonderfully, on condition naturally that the 
vanilla itself is not overdone.) It is well when 
nriftlnng these iccs, which one may almost call arti- 
ficial ices, to add a spoonful or two of whipped cream 
half-way through the freezing, as this adds both 
delicacy and lightness to the mixture. A very few 
drops of colouring may also be added, according to 
the fruit used ; but great care must be taken to keep 
this very delicate, for nothing looks worse thaD 
crude and over-brilliant colouring. Ices made with 
liqueur, or liqueur or fruit syrups, require four full 
tablespoonfuls (two liquid ounces) of the liqueur or 
syrup to the half pint of cream or custard. It is 
well, if using actual liqueur, to make the ice with 
scalded cream, adding a gill or so of fresh whipped 
cream at the last. 

It may be well to add that the various makes of 
liqueur and fruit syrups vary considerably both in 
strength and flavour. The recipes in this book are 
given on the supposition that those of Mrs. A. B. 
Marshall's make are used. The same observation 
applies to the colourings. 

Almond Cream Ice, — Blaiic\i auQi ^oxxxv^ ^qtl* ^*t

Jordan almonds, with six or seven bitter ones, 
moistening it as yon pound, with a spoonful of 
orange flower water to keep it from oiling ; then pour 
on to it l-pint of new milk, rather more than luke- 
warm, coyer the pan and let it stand for one or two 
honrs ; when quite cold add it to a pint of more or 
less rich custard, and freeze it to a batter, when you 
add to it a few drops of essence of almonds, or a 
little noyeau, and one-third of a pint of stiffly 
whipped cream, and finish the freezing. A very 
simple way of making this cream is to use either of 
the custards above given, and flavour to taste with 
essence of almond or noyeau, adding a little brandy. 
American Cream Ice. — Of this there are two forms, 
one rich, the other very plain. For the first, put a 
quart of cream with half a poimd of caster sugar 
and a vanilla bean into a pan, and set this in a 
larger pot three parts full of water, and scald the 
cream, &c., and freeze. This ice is improved by 
standing for a little before serving. (If the cream 
used is very rich it is best to dilute it with a little 
milk, or it will granulate when stirred, and form little 
specks of butter). For the second form, scald a quart 
of milk, then pour it slowly on to three whole eggs 
previously well beaten up with half a pound of 
sugar, stand the pan containing this in the bain- 
marie, and stir it steadily till the custard will coat 
the spoon, but do not let it boil ! Then lift the pan 
off the fire and continue the beating for a few 
minutes after lifting it from the fire ; when cold, add 
a good spoonful of essence of vanilla and freeze.

pulp, should nerer be added to these ices till they 
are cold ; a couple of tablespoonfuls of stiffly whipped 
cream to the pint also, stirred in when the mixture is 
half frozen, adds greatly to the richness. Both these 
ioes can be flayoured in any way to taste. 

Angel Cream Ice, — (This is also an American ice). 
Break, but do not beat, the whites of six eggs, and 
then stir them into half a poimd of caster sugar, and 
pour on them a pint of cream ; now scald this all in 
the bain-marie, being careful it does not boil ; when 
sufficiently thick lift it off the fire, and stir it lightly 
tm it is quite cold (this gives it much lightness) ; 
when perfectly cold add to it haK a gill of noyeau, or 
any liqueur, or orange-flower or rose water to taste. 
When half frozen, add to it some Italian meringue 
made with the whites of two eggs and a tablespoonful 
of hot syrup, and freeze again till perfectly smooth. 
Serve garnished with crystallized orange flowers or 
rose petals. 

Apple Cream Ice, — Peel, core, and slice down two 
pounds of good apples, and cook them to a pulp with 
half a pint of water, the juice and half the finely 
pared rind of one lemon, and 6oz. of sugar ; let it cook 
quickly, then rub it through a tammy or hair sieve, 
and mix it lightly and quickly with a pint of cream 
or custard to taste. The best plan is to slice the 
apples straight into the water in which they are to 
be cooked, having acidulated this beforehand with 
the lemon juice, as this preserves the colour of the 
apples, which is rather important if they are to be 
kept white ; but this ice is sometimes coloured to a 
delicate green^ or a faint pink, SLCcordiii^ to th<^ vvs^

to which It is to be put. Some people again bake 
the apples and use the pulp thus obtained. Baked 
pears treated thus make a delicious and uncommon 
ice. 

Apricot Cream Ice, — If you do not make this ice 
with jam, as above described, take twenty-five to 
thirty good, ripe apricots, halve and stone them, and 
throw about twelve to fifteen of the kernels into one- 
third of a pint of water, with the strained juice of 
two lemons, and let them infuse for a little time. 
Meanwhile pulp the apricots through a sieve, and to 
each pound of this purde add a pound of cane loaf 
sugar, previously boiled, till on dipping your finger 
and thumb into cold water and then into the boiling 
sugar it will form a tiny thread, which, as it breaks, 
will leave two little drops on your finger and thumb. 
When this syrup and the fruit puree are well mixed 
add the kernels pounded and rubbed through a sieve 
with their water, &c. Put this all when cold into 
the freezing tub, and finish off as before. Canned 
apricots pulped, sweetened with sugar boiled in a 
little water and the syrup of the apricots to the 
above degree, and flavoured with five or six bitter 
ahnonds, pounded and infused as before in water and 
lemon juice, make a very nice ice ; and so also does 
canned peach pulp, treated in precisely the same 
way. 

Banana Cream Ice. — Peel and pound six or seven 
ripe bananas, and stir into the pulp thus obtained the 
juice of two lemons, and if liked a glass of cura9oa 
syrup ; add this to a pint of either cream or custard, 
freeze, and use.

Barberry Cream lee, — Stir into a pint of scalded 
cream a full tablespoonful of barberrr jam, add the 
juice of a lemon (this is a matter of taste, and 
depends a good deal on the sweetness of the jam), 
and a few drops of carmine, and freeze. 

Broum Bread Cream Ice. — Prepare a pint of brown 
bread crumbs, and either mix them with one-third 
of a pint of liqueur sjrup, and a pint of CTeam or 
milk, or scald one and a half pints of cream, or half 
cream and half new milk, with a yanilla bean, and 
strain and mix it with the crumbs, putting it into 
the freezer when cold, and freeze. Of course, more 
or less rich custard can be used instead of the cream, 
either with or without a spoonful or two of whipped 
cream stirred into the mixture when half frozen. 
Stale sponge cake crumbs, ratafies, maccaroons, &c., 
ronghlj crumbled, can be used up for ices in this 
way. 

Caramel Cream Ice, — Dissolve four ounces of 
caster sugar in half a gill of water, or preferably, 
lemon juice, and when melted, and of a delicate 
golden brown, stir it into a pint of rich vanilla- 
flavoured custard, whilst both are hot, and when cold 
freeze as usual, either with or without a spoonful or 
so of whipped cream half-waj through. 

Cherry Cream Ice,— Stalk and stone a pound of 
good ripe cherries, and cook them with their blanched 
kernels for ten minutes in half a pint of water, with 
3oz. of sugar, then poimd them, adding the juice 
of one large or two small lemons, and if necessary a 
very few drops of carmine to bring up the colour. 
Bub this all through a tammy or Yiaxr s»\e^fe, ^aA^sxi'^

it either with a pint of cream or the same amoimt of 
custard, and freeze in the usual way. 

Cherry Cream Ice. — ^Pound half a pound of pre- 
served cherries, stones and all, put them in a basin 
with a gill of syrup, the juice of a lemon and a pint 
of cream, rub it all through a sieye and freeze as 
usual. 

Ice. — Pulp two pounds of white heart 

cherries through a sieve, mix them with a pint 
of well- sweetened and whipped cream, adding a few 
drops of essence of almonds, together with the 
chopped and blanched kernels of the cherries, and a 
wineglassful of kirsch syrup and freeze. Add a 
little cream at the last. 

Chocolate Cream Ice. — ^Dissolve 2oz. to 3oz. of best 
vanilla-flavoured chocolate in a very little milk, or 
single cream, or if liked sweet, in syrup, and add it 
to a pint of any of the custards previously given* 
Add it whilst hot to the hot custard, mix it well 
while cooling, and do not attempt to freeze until 
quite cold. 

Coffee Cream Ice. — To a pint of more or less rich 
vanilla-flavoured custard add a gill of very strong 
black coffee or good coffee essence, and sugar to taste. 
A more delicate form of this is well worth the little 
extra trouble it involves: infuse 4oz. of freshly- 
roasted Mocha coffee berries, a little bruised but not 
powdered, in a pint of single cream for an hour at 
the side of the stove, but be careful it does not boil ; 
now tammy, sweeten to taste with about 2oz. to 3oz. 
of sugar, and freeze, adding half way through a gill 
of stiSljr whipped cream, ftavowic^ \i \ilkfiA mith a 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 26 

little brandy or liqueur. This is quite white and very 
delicately flavoured. 

Currant Cream Ice. — Draw down the fruit exactly 
as for jelly-making, and when cool add it in the pro- 
portion of haK a pint of this juice to one and a half 
pints of custard or whipped cream, sweetening it to 
taste. Blackberry or black currant juice is particularly 
good with whipped cream, but requires a little 
additional juice, as they are both rather dry ; say a 
gill of red currant juice to each pint of black currant 
juice, or a few apples cooked with the blackberries. 
Another very delicate currant cream ice is made with 
raw red currant juice stirred into an equal quantity 
of sugar syrup, then added when cool to the whipped 
cream and frozen. 

Fruit Cream Ice. — These ices are very easily made 
by peeling, seeding, and stalking any kind of fruit 
desired, marinading them in lemon juice or liqueur 
syrup, and sugar, for a little time, then stirring them 
into half frozen custard or whipped cream, re-freezing 
the mixture. Or the fruit can be crushed to a pulp, 
sweetened to taste with rather thick syrup, stirred 
into whipped cream, or more or less rich custard, and 
frozen. 

The proportion for making ices from jams are a 
teacupful (say a liberal 4oz.) of jam with three- 
quarters to a pint of custard, and when haK frozen, 
add a gill of whipped cream ; if made of cream only, 
use a pint of cream to the 4oz. of jam. If made 
American fashion with scalded cream, make like 
custard in using a little raw whipped cream at the 
last, when half irozen. 



26 ICES. 

For liqueur or fruit syrups take four good table- 
spoonfuls to eacli half pint of cream or custard, 
remembering however that as syrups vary in strength, 
this variation must be allowed for. The ices in this 
book are all presumed to be made with Mrs. A. B. 
Marshall's fruits and liqueur syrups. 

Of fresh fruit pulp you generally reckon 4oz. to 
the pint of custard or cream. In the latter case, 
whisk sufficient sugar with the fruit pulp to sweeten 
well, and bring it to the consistency of the stiffly 
whipped cream. 

Ginger Cream. Ice. — Mince and pound 2oz. of 
preserved ginger with two tablespoonfulsof the syrup, 
then add to it a pint of single cream, the yolks of 
three or four eggs, and 2oz. or 3oz. of sugar, and stir 
this altogether over the fire till nicely thickened ; 
allow it to cool, and then freeze as usual. Another 
way is to mince two tablespoonfuls of the preserved 
ginger, and add them with two tablespoonfuls of the 
syrup to a pint of whipped cream, and freeze. 

Greengage Cream Ice. — Choose two dozen fine ripe 
greengages, stone them, and blanch the kernels ; 
cook the fruit and the kernels with 4oz. of cane loaf 
sugar till reduced to a rather thin marmalade, 
tammy, and when cool mix tham with a quart of 
either rich custard or whipped cream, and freeze in 
the usual way. 

Lemon Cream Ice. — Peel off the rind of four 

lemons very thinly, and boil this with a pint of new 

milk or single cream, and 4oz. of sugar, for eight or 

ten minutes ; then strain it on to the yolks of five or 

SIX eggs, and cook in the usual ^a.^ till \t Ihicikens ^ 



PLAIN lOES, CREAM AND WATER 27 

tamiDj or sieve it, and when cool stir to it the 
strained juice of the lemons and freeze, adding half 
a gill or so of whipped cream to the mixture, when 
frozen as thick as stifE batter, and finish. 

Liqueur Ices. — ^These are made by adding two 
wineglassfuls or more of any good liqueur to taste, 
to a pint of rich custard or whipped cream, finishing 
in the usual way. A more economical form is to 
use a gill of liqueur syrup to the pint of custard, 
which must, however, not be quite so sweet as usual 
on account of the syrup. 

Marmalade Cream Ice. — This is a nice and rather 
uncommon ice, and is, moreover, an economical one. 
To a pint of ordinary custard add a gill of orange 
or lemon marmalade, together with a dessertspoonful 
each of orange and lemon juice, and freeze. 

Mulberry Cream Ice. — Crush one pound of 
mulberries in a mortar with 6oz. to 8oz. of sugar, 
the juice of a lemon, and a few drops of carmine ; 
mix with a pint of cream or custard, and finish as 
before. This can also be made with mulberry syrup, 
adding four good tablespoonf uls of the syrup to half 
a pint of custard, or whipped cream to taste. 

Neapolitan Ices. — These are simply two or more 
kinds of ice, first frozen to a stiff batter, and then 
arranged in layers in a square, brick-shaped mould 
made for the purpose, which is then set in the 
ice cave for two hours or so, turned out, and served, 
sliced down (so as to show the stripes of colour), 
either in a circle or in little lace papers. 

Nut Cream Ices. — For this have either a rich 
custard or the angel ice previously given^ oad ixfi 



28 lOES. 

to a stiff batter ; then stir into it from 2oz. to ioz. of 
shelled, blanched, and chopped nuts of any kind, 
almonds, walnuts, filberts, oocoanuts, or pistachio., 
as you please. If you brown the almonds after 
shredding them, they are a delicious addition to 
caramel ice, which should, however, be flavoured with 
a little almond essence. A very good imitation of 
pistachio nut ice can be made with almonds, if stirred 
into a rich custard, coloured a faint green with 
vegetable greening, and flavoured with orange flower 
water, and a very little almond essence. 

Orange Cream Ice. — The simplest way to make this 
is like the lemon cream previously given, only allow- 
ing one lemon (peel and juice) to every six oranges. 

Orange (Tangerine) Cream Ice. — Rub off the rinds of 
some six or eight nice fresh Tangerine (or Mandarine) 
oranges on to 6oz. of loaf sugar, and stir it into a 
pint of single cream just brought to the boil ; then 
when this is cool add the juice of the oranges and a 
little extra sugar if needed, and freeze in the usual 
way, adding about three-quarters of a pint of stiffjy 
whipped cream and a liqueur- glassful of cura9oa 
liqueur or syrup (or better still Mandarine liqueur), 
and finish freezing. Ordinary oranges can be treated 
in the same way, but are, of course, not as delicate as 
the Tangerines. 

Orange (Flower-water) Cream Ice, — ^To a pint of 
single cream add 3oz. caster sugar, a gill of orange- 
flower water, a teaspoonful of vanilla essence and a 
spoonful or two of maraschino, partly freeze this, 
then stir into it crystallized rose and orange-flowerSi 
»hout lo^. of each, and serve^ 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 29 

Petich Cream Ice. — Cook some peaches in sugar 
and water syrup till soft enough to pulp, adding to 
them their kernels blanched, then pulp it aU through 
a sieye, add the juice of a lemon, and when cool stir 
into it one and a half pints of new milk or single 
cream, and half freeze, when you add to it a little 
noyeau, and rather more than a gill of stiffly whipped 
cream and finish off as usual. This is for about 
one and a half pints of peach pulp; this ice can 
perfectly well be made with canned peaches, but first 
soften these in their syrup, adding a little more of 
this if necessaiy. 

Pineapple Cream Ice, — Made just like the peach 
cream, adding, however, a little rum if spirit is hked, 
with the juice of a lemon, and a drop or two of 
essence of pineapple to bring up the flavour. 

PrcUine Cream Ice, — Melt 4oz. of sugar over the 
fire till of a rich golden brown, then stir into it 4oz. 
of blanched and roughly chopped Jordan almonds 
and keep these stirred over the fire till browned ; then 
turn them out on to a dish to cool, and when cold 
pound three-quarters of the amount to a powder; 
have ready a pint of rich custard, stir the powdered 
almonds into it whilst warm, and half freeze ; then 
add to it the rest of the praline, and half a pint of 
stiffly whipped cream, and re-freeze. 

Bice Cream Ice. — Cook a good cupful of rice in 
water acidulated with the juice of a lemon, then 
drain and let it steam till dry ; now pour over it 
sufficient thick syrup to cover it, and let it stand for 
an hour at the very least. Then drain off any syrup 
that is not absorbed, add to it half a pint of wkl^^ed 



30 ICES. 

cream, and stir it all into a quart of vanilla or angel 
ice cream, re-freeze and use. This is a delicious 
cream to serve with an iced fruit macedoine, or it can 
be packed in a mould and served with any kind of 
iced fool, &c. 

Rock Cream Ice. — Beat the whites and yolks of 
five eggs separately, mixing with the latter about 
haK a pound of sugar (or you can mix haK with the 
yolks and make a meringue of the eg^ whites and the 
rest of the sugar) ; then mix the two lightly and 
pour on to it a quart of boiling milk, beating it well 
together as you pour; stir it over the fire till it all 
thickens, when you lift it off and allow it to cool. 
Now half freeze it, then stir in a pint of stiffly 
whipped and rather highly flavoured cream, and 
finish off in the usual way. Another form of this 
and a somewhat richer one, is made by using single 
cream in the first instance, and flavouring the second 
lot of cream with some nice liqueur to taste. If to a 
quart of this ice, flavoured with a httle maraschino 
and noyeau, you add, when half frozen, some whipped 
cream and 4oz. to 8oz. each of all or any of the 
following, fresh or preserved strawberries, fresh or 
dried cherries, shred and blanched almonds, grated 
cocoanut, seeded raisins, &c., &c., it becomes an ice 
well known and liked abroad under the name of 
Mille-fruits, 

Rose Cream Ice. — To a pint of single cream add 

3oz. of caster sugar, and scald it ; add to it when 

cool a few drops of vanilla essence, a tablespoonful or 

so of rose water, and the same of maraschino liqueur, 

and half freeze; then add a gvW. oi ^et^ stiffly 



PLAIN ICES. CREAM AND WATER. 31 

whipped cream, and, if necessaiy, a little more 
maraschino, and re- freeze. This is nsoallj garnished 
with crystallized flowers, such as rose leares, violets, 
lilac, 4&C. 

Sherbet Cream lee (Italian), — Stir the yolts of 
four eggs, and a spoonful of orange flower water, into 
one and a half pints of cream, and let it boil up once, 
then sieve it, add lOoz. to 12oz. of sugar, and let it 
stand till this is all melted, then freeze, adding 
half-way through the freezing half a pint of whipped 
cream. 

Strawberry Cream Ice, — Pick and stem the straw- 
berries, and let them marinade for an hour or so, 
strewed with sugar, and the juice of haK a lemon ; 
then crush them to a smooth pulp, and incorporate 
this with an equal amount of scalded or fresh cream, 
add a drop of carmine to bring up the colour, and 
half freeze; then stir in a gill of stiffly whipped 
cream, and finish off. As a matter of fact straw- 
berry cream ice can be made according to all the 
recipes given for foundation creams and custards, 
more or less rich to taste, and either jam or syrup 
may be used, remembering that for jam you allow 
lOoz. of jam to each quart of cream or custard, 
adding the juice of half a lemon and a few drops of 
essence of vanilla to every pint of custard. Or, boil 
up half a vanilla bean with a full gill of new milk, 
and let it infuse for fifteen or twenty minutes in the 
baiQ marie ; then pour it on to the raw yolks of four 
eggs, and stir it over the fire till it thickens ; when 
cooling add four tablespoonfuls of strawberry syrup, 
or two tablespoonfuls of strawberrj ^^lTil^^w^X:^^ ^s^ 



32 ICES. 

three drops of carmine to get it to a pretty pink, 
then tammy it and partly freeze, after which you 
stir in a gill of lightly sweetened and stiffly whipped 
cream, and finish off as before. 

Tea Cream Ice. — Put four good spoonfuls of 
Hyson tea into a pint of cold single cream, and just 
bring it to the boil ; then lift it off the fire at once, 
let it stand in a warm place to infuse for three ox 
four minutes, then strain it off into a pint of cream, 
and again let it just not come to the boil, when you 
pour it on to the yolks of five or six eggs, well beaten 
up with lOoz. or 12oz. of sugar, let it thicken, strain, 
and finish off in the usual way. 

Tutti-Frutti Cream Ice. — ^Eub the juice and ptdp 
of three oranges and three lemons into a basin, and 
add to them three good bananas, and half a tin of 
canned apricots, helping these through with three 
gills of water; then add from lOoz. to 12oz. of 
sugar, and when this is all well dissolved, freeze it 
till smooth ; then stir in a pint of stiffly w^iipped 
cream, and use. Very good without the cream. 

Tutu Frutti Cream Ice (No. II.) . — Cut up small 
3oz. or 4oz. each of candied cherries, apricots, plums, 
chinois (little green candied oranges), almonds, or 
pistachios, &c., and marinade these till somewhat 
softened, in any liqueur, such as kirsch, maraschino, 
&c., or brandy to taste. Have ready half frozen a 
quart of rich vanilla custard, or vanilla flavoured 
cream, as you please (the angel cream ice is very 
good for this) ; add the cut up and marinaded fruit 
to this, and freeze till ready. This makes a verj 
pretty dish if frozen to a battery eow^lstency, then 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 88 

packed in a border, or timbale mould, and set in the 
ice care for a couple of hours, when it is turned out 
and serred with frozen whipped cream flavoured to 
taste with liqueur, or brandy. 

Vanilla Cream Ice, — This can be easily prejmred 
by flaTouring any of the custards previously given, 
when cool, with sufficient essence of vanilla, half 
freezing them, and then adding whipped cream in the 
proportion of a gill of whipped cream to every pint 
of custard ; or, again, a vanilla pod can be boiled up. 
and infused in the milk of which the custard is made, 
as you choose. Naturally, if a pure cream ice is 
chosen, the essence only must be used. 
See also recipe for American cream ice. 
Walnut Cream Ice, — Shell and blanch one and 
a half pounds of walnuts (weighed after blanching). 
Then pound two-thirds of the walnuts to a snuH>tli 
paste, and mix with them very gently the yolks of 
eight eggs, a pint of cream, and 8oz. or 4i>z. of 
caster sugar ; thicken this over the fire, keeping it 
stirred all the time, then tammy, add a httle essence 
of vanilla, and freeze ; half-way through add a gill 
at least of whipped cream and the rest of the walnuts 
roughly chopped, and re-freeze. 

Next in popularity to cream ices come the water 
ices, made with either fruit pulp, jam, or syrup. 
These can be made by adding plain water and sugar 
to the mixture, but a nicer effect is produced if a 
sugar and water syrup is used. This varies in 
strength, and where ices are constantly made it is 
well to invest in a saccharometer, a small tl *- 
mometer-like contriYance by which the ayro;?^

accurately gauged ; for rough and ready use, how- 
ever, the following syrup will be found excellent : 
Boil together three pounds of cane loaf sugar with 
three quarts of cold water, keeping it well skimmed, 
allow it to reduce by rapid boiling to half this 
quantity, then strain through a clean fine cloth and 
bottle for use. In the chapter on Odds and Ends more 
definite particulars will be given as to the making 
of this syrup, and also with regard to boiling sugar. 

If making water ices with fruit pulp (obtained by 
cooking the fruit till soft enough to sieve, if sub- 
stantial, like apples, &c., or by simply pulping the 
fruit through a sieve, as in the CAse of strawberries, 
&c.), allow either a pint of water and 6oz. to 8oz. of 
sugar to the pint of pulp (taking the sweetness of 
the fruit into account) ; or else allow six fuU table- 
spoonfuls of the sugar syrup to the haK pint of pulp. 
For instance, for lemon water, allow a pint of boiling 
water and 8oz. of loaf sugar to six lemons ; or, if 
using syrup, allow the juice of four to six lemons to 
the pint of boiling syrup. Lemon water ice is the 
foundation of so many other things that it may be as 
well to give the recipe for it first of all. 

Lemon Water Ice. — ^Peel six to eight lemons very 
thinly, and pour on to their peel a full pint of boiling 
sugar and water syrup (or put half a pound of sugar 
with the peel, and pour a pint of boiling water over 
it all), let it stand till cold, then strain it, add the 
strained juice of six lemons, and freeze. 

Apple Water Ice. — Peel, core, and slice a pound of 

good apples into a pint of water acidulated with the 

juice of one lemon, add a fttxv^ or t^o oi the ^jeel, 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 35 

and 2oz. of sugar ; boil it all to a pulp, then rub it 
through a sieve, and to each pint of this pur^e add a 
pint of syrup, and freeze. 

Apricot Water Ice. — ^Make like the apple water. 

Halve and stone about thirty good ripe 

apricots, crack the stones, and blanch and pound 
luilf the kernels, infusing them for a little in 
half a pint of water, with the juice of two lemons ; 
rub the fruit to a pulp, and to each pound of this 
pulp allow a pint of the sugar syrup, mix well, add 
the pounded kernels with the water, &c., in which 
they were infused, tammy it all, and freeze. 

Banana Water Ice. — Peel and pound six good • 
bananas, add to them the juice of two lemons (or 
oranges, if preferred), and a pint of sugar syrup, and 
freeze. 

Barberry Water Ice. — Put the barberries into a 
preserving pan with just enough water to keep them 
from burning, and keep them well stirred over a gentle 
fire ; when warm and burst, turn them into a jelly 
bag and let them strain, or else pulp them through 
a sieve as you please, diluting them with sufficient 
sugar syrup to sweeten them to taste (adding a little 
more water if they are too thick), then when cold, . 
freeze. This can also be made with barberry jam, by 
mixing two good tablespoonfuls of the latter with , 
the juice of a lemon (the firsc does not require this , 
as the fresh fruit is sour enough), a pint of water, 
and a few drops of cochineal or carmine ; sieve it all, 
and freeze. This ice is improved by the addition of 
a spoonful or two of Italian meringue, as it should 
be very smooth and thick. 

D 2 



36 ICES. 

Black Currant Water Ice, — ^Pound together two 
pounds of ripe black currants and a pound of black 
heart cherries, with the blanched kernels of the 
latter ; mix them with 6oz. of caster sugar, one and 
a half pints of cold water, and a few drops of 
carmine to improve the colour, rub it all through a 
sieve, and freeze. 

Cherry Water Ice, — Stalk and stone two pounds 
of ripe red chemes, bruise them, and set them over 
the fire in the preserving pan with half a pound of 
loaf sugar and a little water ; let them boil up tiD 
soft enough to pulp through a hair sieve ; blanch 
• and pound a good handful of the cherry kernels, and 
infuse them for a little in the juice of two lemons. 
Now add to the cherries a pound of sugar, boiled 
till on dipping the fingers into cold water and then 
into the sugar it will form a tiny thread, breaking 
off into tiny drops at each end; mix the fruit and 
sugar well together, and pour it on to the lemon 
juice and kernels, mix it altogether thoroughly, and 
freeze. Of course, this ice can be simply made with 
either jam or cherry syrup, but the little trouble 
involved by the above is well worth taking. 

(Mrs. A. B. Marshall's recipe). — Mix 

the finely sieved pulp of two pounds of ripe white 
heart cherries with a pint of lemon water ice, six 
or eight drops of essence of almonds, the blanched 
and chopped kernels of the fruit, and a claret-glassful 
of Kirsch syrup ; freeze in the usual way. 

Chocolate Water Ice. — Melt 3oz. of vanilla choco- 
late and mix it with half a pint of water and a gill of 
sugar sjTup, and freeze. 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 37 

Coffee Water Ice. — Mix together equal parts of 
good strong coffee, and sugar sjrnp boiled as for 
cherry water, add a liqueur-glassful of brandy or 
marascliino to the half pint and freeze. 

Ginger Water Ice. — Pound 4oz. of preserved 
ginger, and mix with a pint of orange water ice, 
tammy and freeze. 

Gooseberry Water Ice. — Top and tail a quart of 
green gooseberries, and cook with lOoz. or 12oz. of 
caster sugar, a strip or two of thinly peeled lemon 
rind, and a pint of water, till soft enough to pulp 
through a sieve ; then add the juice of a lemon and 
a few drops of green colouring, and freeze. If liked^ 
a gill of maraschino syrup may be added during the 
freezing. 

Chape Water Ice. — Stalk some ripe grapes, and 
crush them through a sieve, add to them sufficient 
sugar to sweeten it all well, with the juice of two 
lemons, and freeze. You require about a pint of 
grape pulp for the above. 

Stir one claret-glassful of elderflower 

water and two sherry-glassfuls of sherry to each 
pint of lemon water ice, and freeze. 

Juniper Water Ice. — Boil a good handful of 
juniper berries in a pint of water with half a poimd 
of sugar and a piece of cinnamon, then crush it all 
through a tammy, adding a little more water, if 
necessary, and freeze. 

lAquewr Water Ice. — Mix a pint of water with a 
full gill of any liqueur syrup to taste, add a wine- 
glassful of the liqueur itself, and freeze. This is 
more often used in conjunction with other ices than 



38 ICES. 

alone ; for instance, as a filling, if made witli kirsch, 
to a cherrj cream ice bombe, &c. 

Melon Water Ice. — Peel a ripe melon and pound 
the flesh till smooth, then mix with it half a pint of 
water, 3oz. of sugar, the juice of two lemons or 
oranges, and a glass of maraschino syrup, add to 
this a pint more water and freeze. Particularly 
good if champagne is used instead of the last 
water. 

Mulberry Water Ice, — Pound one pound of the 
fruit in a mortar with 6oz. to 8oz. of caster sugar, 
the juice of a lemon, and a few drops of carmine ; 
tammy, mix with one pint of cold water and freeze. 
This can also be made by freezing together four 
tablespoonfuls of mulberry syrup and haK a pint 
of cold water. 

Orange Water Ice, — Peel and quarter ten or 
twelve fine blood oranges, remove the pips and the 
core, and then pound the pulp with the finely grated 
rind of two of the oranges ; wring this all through 
a tammy to extract every drop of juice, and then 
mix this with half a pound of sugar previously dis- 
solved in a pint of water, and freeze. 

Peel the rind of eight oranges very 

finely with that of one lemon, and add to this half a 
pound of sugar; then pour on to them a pint of 
absolutely boiling water, and let it stand covered till 
cold, when you mix in the juice of six oranges, 
tammy or sieve, and freeze. 

Strawberry Water Ice. — Draw down the straw- 
berries as for jelly, and add half a pint of this juice 
to a quart of sjrup made by boiling together a quart 



PLAIN ICES, CREAM AND WATER. 39 

of water, and one and a quarter pounds of cane loaf 
sugar for ten minutes. Freeze as usual. 

TvituFrutti Water Ice, — This can be made in two 
ways. (1) Crush any fruit such as strawberries, 
raspberries, currants, cherries, gooseberries, &c., to 
a pulp, and to each quart of this pulp add a full pint 
of sugar syrup flavoured with lemon juice and maras- 
chino, or other liqueur or liqueur syrup, and let it 
stand till cold ; then freeze as usual. This makes a 
delicious ice. The syrup should be 32° on the 
saccharometer. (2) The other way of preparing 
this is to cut up any fruit, fresh, candied, preserved, 
or canned, just as they come, into dice, sprinkle 
these with a little sugar and liqueur syrup, and then 
stir them into haK-frozen lemon water ice in the 
proportion of half a poimd of fruit to each quart of 
ice. This is a capital way of using up any fruit 
left over from dessert.. Make the lemon water ice 
according to the second recipe for orange water ice. 



CHAPTER III. 

SOEBETS AND GRANITI. 

The sorbet and the granito were probably the earliest 
form of table ice invented, as for neither of them 
was actual ice really needed; the necessary cooling 
being effected by the use of snow alone. The sorbet, 
as its name implies, is a direct descendant of the 
Oriental "sherbet," and probably, in the first 
instance, was popularised in Europe at the time of 
the Crusades, as those religious warriors, the 
Crusaders, and the various orders of military 
monks of that time, greatly affected Eastern habits, 
and brought over a train of Moorish and Turkish 
slaves, to whom the preparation of sherbet would 
naturally be no novelty. The granito probably 
obtained its name from the little tinkling grains 
of ice found in the semi-liquid mass, and produced 
by the uneven freezing. The granito has stayed 
chiefly in the country of its first adoption — ^Italy — 
and is a form of water ice much enjoyed by all who 
visit Naples especially. 

To sherbet, or sorbet as it became, a curious fate 
was reserved. Having originated as a cooling drink 
for the use and refreshment of the inhabitants of the 
sultry climes round about the equator, it attracted 



SORBETS AND GRANITI. 41 

tha uotioe of the Europeans, whose trading instincts 
carried them to the rich markets of the East, some 
three centuries ago. They developed the dainty 
mixture of sweet and sour obtained by the use of 
sugar or honey, and fruit pulp, by the addition of 
alcohol, without which those worthy gentlonien wero 
apt to think no beverage wholesome; and thus 
having spoilt the sherbet, to Moslem ideas, by this 
addition, the latter called the new drink " punch,'* 
or rather by a Sanscrit word of somewhat similar 
sound, indicating five, by reason of the five elements, 
sugar, water, fruit pulp, spice, and lastly alcohol, of 
which the novelty was composed. They probably 
drank it cooled with snow like the natives, but when 
they brought it home with them they substituted 
boiling, for the semi-frozen water, fortifying it with 
the strongest liquor obtainable, till the erstwhile 
summer drink developed into a brew strong enough 
to counteract even the cold of the Northern yulotido. 
This punch was first served, as it still is, at City 
banquets, after the turtle soup had gone round ; thcMi 
its excellent peptic effects being recognised, it was 
adopted as a digestive after the heavy j)art of the 
dinner, and so obtained the position in the m(»nu now 
always kept by the sorbet, immediately after the 
joint, and just preceding the rot, or roast, or, as wo 
more commonly say, the second course. 

Somewhere about a century ago, some adventurous 
spirit, remembering its old state, elccUnl to ice his 
punch, and produced a liquor so attractive, that 
under the name of " Punch a la Romaine," it came 
into general favour. In this, aa Wie x^d^ ^v^^\l^2>Xet

shows, the water-steeped fruit pulp was replaced by 
a water ice of some kind, usually, if not invariably, 
at first, a lemon water ice, to which the alcohol and 
spice in the shape of liquid essences were added 
during the course of its freezing. 

These sorbets were as they still are, usually served 
in portions, a glass or cup for each guest, and soon 
some of the more skilful glaciers evolved little cups 
of real ice in which to serve them; these were at 
first imitations of the primitive method of serving 
these ices, when a water ice was piled up in one of 
the flat tazza-like champagne glasses, the pyramidal 
top being flattened down and hollowed, so as to 
contain a tablespoonful of spirit or liqueur to taste. 
Then came the actual ice cup; for this a large 
shallow tub was chosen and filled with a mixture of 
ice, salt, and saltpetre, as many wineglasses as were 
required being packed in this mixture, and filled up 
with any fruit syrup to taste ; a cover was then 
placed over the top of the glasses to keep dust, &c., 
off, and the whole was left till a thick skin of fruit 
ice had formed round the glasses, the still liquid 
syrup in the centre was poured off, and the glasses 
returned to the ice tub to harden ; and then when 
wanted they were turned out from their moulds, and 
served, filled up with any sorbet, or, for that matter, 
any ice, to taste. This process, however, was not 
altogether an easy one, and only the masters of their 
art attempted such things. Now, however, these ice 
cups are within the reach of any one possessing an 
ice cave who cares to go to the expense of the proper 
ice'Cup moulds, oi which we gW^ «ai iU\s&tx&tLon

(Pig. 9). The latest ideas, however, are nowadays 
the ice tray, and the ice bowl, on the same principle 
as the ice cup, and, like that, introduced by Mrs. 
A. B. Marshall. These are excellent for serving 
sorbets, and all sorts of ices, not to mention that they 
come in splendidly for cold vegetables, e,g.f asparagus, 
which never shows to such advantage as when pre- 
sented on one of these ice trays. The process of 
freezing them is easy enough. Fill the moulds three 
parts full (to allow of the ice expanding on freezing) 
and set them in the ice cave for two and a half to 
four hours, according to size.

Punch a la Romaine. — Add to a quart of cherry 
water ice, when half frozen, a bottle of moselle, 
31 wineglassful each of kirsch, noyeau, and gin, and 
work till well frozen, then stir in an Italian meringue 
of five egg whites, give it another turn or two, and 
serve. 

Stir into one pint of noyeau water ice a 

gill of curacoa, a pint of orange wine, and the whites 
of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth, with 3oz. or 4oz. 
caster sugar, freeze, and serve. 

Punch au Bordeaux. — Grate off the yellow part 
of the rind of two oranges on half a pound of loaf 
sugar in lumps, pour half a pint of water over this 
and let stand for some time covered. Then boil it 
to a syrup, and when ready lift it off the fire ; when 
it has somewhat cooled add to it the strained juice 
of three oranges, and as soon as this is all quite 
cold stir into it half a bottle of claret and a table- 
spoonful of brandy, and freeze. A full dessert- 
spoonful of red currant jelly, previously melted, and 
a little port wine instead of the brandy are much 
liked by some people. 

Into a bowl place a good bottle of claret, 

and stir to it one and a half pints of strong syrup, 
with haK a lemon thinly sliced, a teaspoonful of

a bed of cnished ice. 

Punch a la Monaco. — On to two slices of canned 
or fresh pine, cut into inch cubes, pour a gill of 
brandy, then a bottle of dry sherry, and lastly two 
bottles of Sauteme, and set it on ice for an hour ; 
just as it is to be served put in half a pint of lemon 
water ice, and pour on to it all a bottle of well-iced 
sparkhng Moselle, and serve at once. 

Punch a la Gla^e. — In a bowl place a rather stiffly 
frozen bombe (or conical mould) of strawberry ice, 
lay in with it two thinly sliced lemons freed from 
pips, then pour in half a pint each of rum, mara- 
schino, and syrup, and lastlv a bottle of well-iced 
champagne. Serve at once. 

Before proceeding with special recipes for sorbets 
as used in these days, a few general directions for 
their preparation may be given. Their foundation is 
invariably a water ice, and this water ice may be 
made exactly as given in the chapter on water ices, 
either with fresh fruit, jam, or fruit syrup, of any 
kind ; to this is then added two full wineglassf uls of 
spirit for each pint of water ice, and when dished 
the cups are garnished with fresh fruit to taste, pre- 
viously sprinkled with liqueur and caster sugar, and 
left in the ice cave or on ice till icy cold. It is of 
course on the blending of these various flavours that 
the excellence of the sorbet depends, for it is not 
necessary that the whole of the spirit used should 
be of one kind ; in fact, it is more usual to use two- 
thirds liqueur of some sort to one-third of some even 
8 ronger apint At the same t\mft\t\xi\\s^\ife\^Ts^^

in mind that sorbets are very nearly, if not quite, as 
good when their origin is remembered and no spirit 
at all is used in their preparation, one or more of the 
good non-alcoholic liqueur syrups being substituted, 
and in this way they are far more suitable for the 
five o'clock teas, tennis-parties, &c., at which of late 
they have made their appearance. A mould of water 
ice prepared as for sorbet, with the centre filled up 
with an iced macMoine of fruit or any kind of frozen 
fruit fool makes a most delicious dish for such 
occasions, but then liqueur syrup instead of the real 
article, is a sine qua non, 

Apple Sorbet — Peel and slice one and a half 
pounds of good cooking apples, and put them in a 
pan with 6oz. of caster sugar, the thinly peeled rind 
of a lemon, a bay leaf, and a pint of water (the 
amount of this must to some extent depend on the 
juiciness of the apples) ; let it all cook till the 
apples are quite soft, then add the juice of two 
lemons, with a very few drops of vegetable green 
colour to bring it just to a faint cucumber shade of 
green, and rub it all through a fine sieve ; half 
freeze, then stir in the whites of two eggs whipped to 
a stiff froth, with caster sugar (or an equal quantity 
of Italian meringue), and re-freeze till quite smooth ; 
now add a wineglassful of brandy, and dish, gar- 
nishing with either crystallized cherries or well- 
drained brandy cherries. 

Apricot Sorbet, — Prepare a pint of apricot water 
ice, and freeze till of the consistency of thick batter; 
now add four good tablespoonfuls of Italian 
meringue, and re-freeze, adding to it when smooth a 



SORBETS AND GRANITI. 47 

wiiieglassful of niarascliino and a not quite full one 
of either apricot brandy or rum. Re-freeze and 
serve garnished with crystallized apricots and an- 
gelica, or, if preferred, fresh fruits nicely marinaded 
in lemon juice and sugar, and iced. 

Banana Sorbet, — Peel and crush six good ripe 
bananas, adding to them 4oz. of caster sugar, the 
strained juice of two good oranges, and three-quarters 
of a pint of water. Freeze as before to a batter, 
then add three or four tablespoonfuls of Italian 
meringue, re-freeze, and when smooth work in a wine- 
glassful of cognac, and a full one of maraschino 
syrup (not liqueur), and again freeze. Serve gar- 
nished with sliced, marinaded, and iced bananas. 

CardinaVa Sorbet — Add to one and a half pints of 
half-frozen raspberry water ice (flavoured with lemon 
and coloured with a few drops of carmine), about 
three full tablespoonfuls of Italian meringue, and re- 
freeze till smooth, when you work into it half a gill 
each of maraschino and cura9oa, and again freeze. 
Serve garnished with ripe raspberries, previously 
sprinkled with lemon juice and caster sugar and 
placed on ice till perfectly cold. 

Cassis Sorbet, — To a quart of half-frozen black 
currant water ice add four good tablespoonfuls of 
Italian meringue, freeze till smooth, then add a 
claret- glassful of noyeau or of liqueur de cassis, and 
a liqueur-glassful of brandy. Re-freeze and serve 
garnished with blanched almonds (one or two of 
which should be bitter).

two, then serve in ice cups, garnished with stoned 
fresh cherries marinaded in lemon juice and sugar, 
and iced. 

Cherry Sorbet. — This is a particularly delicate 
sorbet made with white heart cherries (and is 
adapted with apologies from a recipe of Mrs. A. B. 
Marshall's for a most delicious water ice) ; for it 
stone and pulp a quart of fine ripe white heart 
cherries, and add this pulp, with the cherry kernels 
blanched and minced, to a pint of lemon water ice, 
with a couple or so of spoonfuls of Italian meringue, 
and freeze till smooth, when you add to it a glassful 
each of kirsch and good brandy, re-freeze, and serve 
garnished with drained cherries from a bottle of 
cherry brandy. 

Damson Sorbet. — Stone two pounds of damsons, 
and blanch and pound the kernels; pulp the fruit 
and then mix it with the pounded kernels, haK a 
pint of strong sugar syrup, and one and a half pints 
of boiling water, add a few drops of carmine if 
necessary, to bring up the colour, and the juice of a 
lemon (or two if they are not very juicy), and let it 
stand till perfectly cold ; now freeze to a thick 
batter, add a glassful of kirsch, noyeau, or brandy, if 
preferred, and three-quarters of a gill of damson gin ; 
re-freeze, and serve garnished, with blanched and 
shred almonds. 

Gooseberry Sorbet. — Stew a quart of nice green 
£^oo8eheme8 in one and a half pints of water, with 



SOEBETS AND G&ANlTt 4d 

&OZ. to 6oz. of sugar (this depends on their sweet- 
ness, as if very young, more sugar maj be needed) ; 
when quite tender add to them the juice of a lemon 
and a few drops of green colouring (mind that the 
colour is not made too dark), tammj it all, and 
leave till cold. When perfectly cold put it into the 
freezer and freeze to a thick batter, when you arid to 
it a full gill of maraschino, and a good glassful of 
brandy, freeze, and serve. 

Grape and Sherry Sorbet, — To a quart of lemon 
water ice add two good wineglassfuls of good elder- 
flower water and a gill of sherry ; re-freeze, and serve, 
garnished with grapes, skinned and seeded, and 
marinaded in sugar and maraschino, and crystallized 
rose leaves. 

GreeJc Sorbet — To a pint of sugar syrup add eight 
tablespoonfuls of strained orange juice, and freeze 
this to a batter, adding to it just before it is finished 
a good spoonful of brandy, two of maraschino, and 
some crystallized ginger, cut up small. 

Liqueur Sorbets. — Mix together a pint of water 
and half a pint of any liqueur syrup to taste, freeze, 
add an Italian meringue of three egg whites and 
three spoonfuls of caster sugar, re-freeze till 
smooth, and add a good wineglassful of any liqueur, 
with or without a liqueur-glassful of brandy or rum 
to taste, re-freeze, and serve garnished with marinaded 
glacis fruits or flowers to taste. For instance, for 
curacoa use crystallized oranges, rose leaves for 
maraschino, crystallized cherries for kirsch, &c.

melon till smooth, then add to it half a pint of water, 
3oz. of sugar, the juice of two lemons and two oranges, 
and another half pint of water, tammj it all, and 
half freeze, then add a couple of good tablespoonfuls 
of Italian meringue, re -freeze, and when quite 
smooth add rather more than half a gill of curacoa, 
and finish freezing. Serve garnished with thinly 
shred slices of melon, previously sprinkled generously 
with champagne and caster sugar (and a tiny pinch 
of ginger, if Hked), and iced. 

Noyeau and Lemon Sorbet, — Make a noyeau water 
ice by freezing together tiU thick a pint of cold 
water, six tablespoonfuls of noyeau syrup, and a 
liqueur-glassful of noyeau, then add two or three 
tablespoonfuls of Italian meringue and re-freeze till 
smooth. Dish it in cups (either ice or glass), alter- 
nately with a lemon sorbet, and'serve garnished with 
crystallized rose leaves and violets. (This sorbet is 
equally good if apricot water ice flavoured with a 
spoonful or two of rum is used instead of the lemon.) 

For the lemon sorbet mix the half frozen water 
ice with Italian meringue, and when quite smooth 
add to it a good glassful of brandy. 

Orange Sorbet. — Eub off the yellow part of the 

rind of eight oranges on to half a pound of loaf 

sugar, then pour on to this a pint of boiling water, 

and let it stand till cool, when you add to it the juioe 

of the oranges, three tab\e8pooiii\]A& oi brojidy^ a gill

cajidied orange peel, marinaded in a little brandy. 

Orange Sorbet (Tangerine.) — Peel 12 Tangerine 
oranges and infuse their peel in a pint of boiling water 
for fifteen to twenty minutes, but without letting it 
boil; pulp the oranges through a sieve and add this 
pulp with 4oz. of caster sugar to the water in which 
the peel was infused, and when it is quite cold f riH»Z(» 
to a batter, add two or three spoonfuls of Italian

in a little sugar and cham-pagne. 



SORBETS AND GRANITI. 58 

Strawberry water sorbet, like almost all fruit 
sorbets, is extremely good if prepared as above only 
with non-alcoholic liqueurs ; but though in this case 
such sorbets very nearly reproduce the old sherbet, 
they are not properly speaking sorbets, a name which, 
in these days at least, implies a mixture of alcohol of 
some kind. 

The granito proper was always made with a light 
sugar syrup and fresh fruit juice, and in making 
them the freezing pot or tub was not turned 
regularly, and moreover only half the ordinary 
quantity of salt was added to the ice, thus in every 
way making the freezing irregular and imequal. 
The granite is at its proper consistency when it is a 
semi-fluid mass of snow-Kke texture mixed with 
actual little icicles. The process is in every case the 
same. For instance, for currant granito, take equal 
quantities of a light sugar syrup (registering 
20 degrees on the saccharometer), and the strained 
juice of the currants obtained as for currant jolly ; 
pour this into the charged freezing tub, but only 
adding half a part of salt to two of ice, and begin 
freezing in the ordinary way, stopping every now 
and again and letting the machine rest ; in about 
five minutes it should be just right, and should, 
properly, be used at once, as it is too liquid to keep 
well ; and it loses its character if it solidifies. Any 
fruit juice or thin fruit pulp can be used thus, and 
indeed any water ice composition can be used, only 
using the sugar syrup of the degree just given, and 
adhering to the imequal freezing. A particularly 
delicate Jdnd is the granito aH'oTcxata, ISot "Cs^

prepare some almond milk by pounding together 
some sweet Jordan almonds with a very few bitter 
ones, say 4oz. of sweet to one (not loz.) bitter one, 
and pour on to this half a pint of boiling milk, cover 
the basin, and allow it to infuse for half an hour, 
then wring or tammy it through a cloth ; this is 
pure ahnond milk ; mix this with an equal quantity 
of the light syrup, and freeze as before. A very few 
drops of vanilla, lemon, or other essence may be 
added to this ice to flavour it to taste. In Italy, 
half almonds and half melon seeds are used in the 
making of it, which gives it a peculiar and delicate 
flavour. These are the original graniti ; but nowa- 
days, as said above, almost any water ice is prepared 
in this way and served as a granito, if liked ; though 
in Italy, at all events, spirit seldom, if ever, enters 
into their composition. The one exception is 

Granito au Champagne (and this really is a French 
version). — For this mix a pint of the light syrup with 
a bottle of champagne, and freeze as before; re- 
membering always that it is the reduced quantity of 
salt in the freezing mixture, and the irregular 
freezing that gives it its character. 

Granito au Cafe (a very favourite one) is made by 
adding haK a pint of syrup to a pint of strong black 
coffee, flavouring it to taste with a very little maras- 
chino or cognac, and freezing.

syrup made by boiling a pound of loaf sugar to half

The above directions show sufficiently how this 
particular ice is made ; so it is easy to vary the kinds 
to taste, using any water ice recipe, in accordance 
with the foregoing directions. They make excellent 
refreshments for tennis parties, <&c., as the fact of 
their being irregularly iced renders them easy to 
make in any home-made icing machine or freezing 
pot. 



CHAPTEE IV. 

MOULDED AND FAlfCY ICES. 

Ices of all kinds can be moulded (especiallj if one 
possesses an ice cave), and in this way form very 
pretty entremets. The ice to be used must be first 
frozen in the freezing tub till of the consistency 
of stiff batter, then placed in the mould, which 
should have been first washed in warm water, next 
well rinsed in cold, and finally placed in the chained 
ice cave to ensure its being thoroughly cold before 
the ice is put into it. Do not fill the mould too 
quickly, but put it in by spoonfuls, pressing it well 
home so that it may take the impression of the 
mould correctly, and have the edges sharp when 
turned out. (To turn out, dip the mould in cold 
water, wipe well, and turn out.) Especially must 
this care be taken when the mould to be used is a 
very ornate one, with flowers and fruit on the top ; 
these latter being frequently arranged in differently 
coloured and flavoured ices, to correspond with the 
objects they represent. It may, however, be observed, 
that the plainer the mould, in reason, the better will 
the effect be. Few things look better in this way than 
the tall tapering bombe mould, standing alone on its 
napkin or bed of soft wa^din^, ot, \i preferred, 



MOULDED AND FANCY ICES. 57 

garnished round the base, either with an iced com- 
pote, or piled-up individual ices, t.e., little moulds 
filled up with various kinds of ice. 

The last year or two it has been the fashion to 
serve individual moulded ices on blocks of ice, 
either plainly hollowed out, or carved into the shape 
of baskets, vases, <fec., and the result is doubly 
successful, as not only do they look very pretty 
served in this way, but they also keep their flavour 
and consistency better. Mrs. A. B. Marshall has 
brought out two very nice moulds for this purpose 
(one in the shape of a square or oblong tray, the 
other of a bowl), which can be three-parts fiUed with 
plain or coloured water, and then frozen in the ice 
cave for two to four hours, according to their size ; 
these are placed on a napkin, or a pad of lightly 
teased- out, delicately white wadding (both these are 
non-conductors of heat, and so keep the bowl or dish 
from thawing) ; the ice being then placed on this 
(literal) ice dish. In cases where melon shapes, egg, 
or fancy moulds are used, a very pretty effect is 
obtained by filling a border mould with either plain 
water, or some appropriately coloured water ice, and 
when this is frozen, turning it out and using it as a 
stand for the actual ice. 

Moulded ices are either of the plain rich ice, or of 
two kinds of ice, placed in the moulds in layers, or 
else the mould is lined an inch or so thick, and then 
filled up with a sorbet, whipped and frozen cream, 
iced fruit macedoine, &c., &c. But taste is required 
with these mixtures, as it is fatal to have either the 
(jolours or the flavour? too i^ux^ oic \«><^ ^\ax?OisE^, 



58 lOES. 

Do not reduce all your dishes to one dead level 
by over colouring, but keep each tint dean 
and distinct, and as like nature as possible. The 
same advice applies also to flavouring; artistic 
training teaches us that too many colours mixed 
together "will in the end produce a dirty white; 
in the same way too many flavours blended 
injudiciously will utterly destroy one another, and 
reduce the whole to a chaotic and indescribable 
compound. (It may be remarked in passing, that 
this is the fault of the British cook in almost every 
branch of cookery, in her sauces especially, as she 
piles on one condiment after another, till she confuses 
the whole.) In ices, as in everything else, the 
flavours should be distinct ; let your strawberry ice 
taste distinctly of strawberry, your lemon water of 
lemon (and not, as too often happens, of essence of 
lemon and citric acid !) In short, when you label a 
dish with any name be sure the flavour bestowing 
the name is marked enough to allow of the consumer 
knowing, even blindfold, of what the sweet he is 
enjoying is made. 

Of moulds the best, and also the most expensiye, 
are of pewter, or copper; for though tin moulds 
were made for the purpose, under the old system, 
they were practically useless. But now thanks to 
the ice cave, by which all contact with the freezing 
medium is avoided, any ordinary jelly moulds can 
be used. Needless to say that moulds of all kinds, 
and representing all sorts of objects, both floral and 
vegetable, as well as animal, are to be had, but, aa 
said before, the simpler the Bha^^a c^\xo^^Ti)\]bv!^ W^i:

in taste will be the result. Flowers and fmit are 
pretty enough, especially for the small indiyidual 
ices ; at the same time they are not economical, as 
they are mostly made in the more costly metal, 
whilst the plain dariole and bouche moulds, which 
the ice cave allows one to use, are far less expensive 
to buy, and much the easiest to turn out, and to use. 
As regards birds, fishes, and zoological specimens of 
aU sorts, they are but a passing fancy, and need not 
enter into the calculations of those who wish to 
study economy. The bombe mould is the most 
generally useful of the distinctive ice moulds, and if 
more varietv be desired, the melon mould is most 
satisfactory. Beyond these, plain charlotte and 
border moulds will be amply sufficient. Here are a 
few directions which may help the beginner, but in 
truth an intelligent cook will soon learn to vary them 
for herself almost indefinitely. 

Melon en Surprise, — Well wash and rinse the 
melon mould, then stand it in the cave for a little till 
thoroughly cold; have ready some pistachio ice 
(make this according to the recipe for nut cream ice, 
either using pistachios, and tinting the custard 
faintly with green, or else use the imitation pistachio 
ice given at the end of that recipe) ; line the melon 
mould fully an inch thick with this, and fill up the 
centre either with kirsch water ice (see recipe for 
liqueur ices), or with kirsch sorbet (see liqueur 
sorbets), or cherry sorbet, in which you have stirred 
a few burnt almonds. Now close the mould and set 
it in the ice cave for two and a half to three hours, 
turning it occasionally to ensure its freezing equally ; 



60 lOES. 

when ready, dip the mould in cold water, pass a 
clean cloth over it, to absorb the moisture, and turn 
it out on to a plain ice border, made by three parts 
filling a border mould that will hold the melon with 
plain water, and then setting it in the charged ice 
cave for two and a half to three hours, turning it 
out in the same way as you do the melon mould. 

This ice can be varied indefinitely ; for instance, 
line the mould with a rich ginger cream ice, coloured 
to a delicate apricot yellow, and fill the inside with a 
fairly frozen melon and champagne sorbet. Or, line 
it with a rich vanilla custard ice, and fill up the 
centre with a strawberry sorbet made according to 
the second recipe given in the chapter on sorbets, 
&c., &c. 

Very simple, yet very attractive, iced sweets for 
dinner use may be made by packing any ice to taste 
in a border mould, then filling up the centre with a 
contrasting cream or water ice ; for instance, have a 
border mould of strawberry cream ice, and fill up the 
centre with whipped cream sweetened and flavoured 
with maraschino in which you have stirred some 
small Alpine strawberries, or halved or quartered 
larger fruit ; or, make a mould of white coffee cream 
ice and fill it up with strawberry or cherry water ice ; 
or, make the border of lemon water ice and fill it up 
with a macMoine of iced fruit; or, line a bombe 
mould with chocolate cream ice and fill it up with 
apricot water or banana cream ice, as you please; 
or again, line either a bombe or a melon mould an inch 
thick with good apple cream ice delicately coloured 
to a pretty apple green, and fiO. u:p \]ia^^ mXensst^lV %»

tomato sorbet, made thus : slice down a pound of ripe 
and very red tomatoes into a pan with a pint of 
water, the jnice of a lemon, three sliced apples, two 
tablespoonfols of apricot jam, and 5oz. to 6oz. of 
sugar, bring this all to the boil, then allow it to 
sinmier till tender enough to pulp, when you add a 
few drops of liquid carmine, if necessary, and tammy 
it ; when cool, flavour with rum or brandy to taste, 
and when cold freeze a little and fiU up the centre of 
the mould with it, close it down and freeze in the ice 
cave for two to three hours. Another form of varied 
ices is the Neapolitan ice. For this you have the 
brick-shaped mould, illustrated in a previous chapter, 
fill this (if you have the conveniences therefore) 
with separately frozen ices, which must be of the 
consistency of rather stiff batter, and arranged in 
very smooth layers, in varied colours and flavours 
as you please ; for instance, a layer of vanilla cream, 
then a layer of strawberry water, and lastly chocolate 
cream ; or strawberry and white coffee cream ices ; or 
a brown bread cream ice delicately flavoured with 
cognac, a coffee ice, similarly flavoured with mara- 
schino, and lastly a vanilla cream ; or begin with the 
vanilla made on a foundation of rich custard, and use 
whipped or scalded cream only for the other two. 
In short, these can be varied in any way you fancy. 
They are generally served, when turned out, by being 
sliced down about three-quarters to one inch thick and 
served en couronne, or in little separate lace papers. 
Where there is a difficulty with r^ard to freezing 
tubs, the best way is to prepare a quart of m 
less rich, sweetened, but \mfia.vo\iieA.,

cream, and when rather more than half frozen 
divide it into two or three parts as desired, 
flavouring one with, say, vanilla, and lay this smoothly 
in the mould, then take another portion, and 
stir into this, say, an ounce of chocolate melted 
in a little cream, and place this on the vanilla 
layer ; and finally add to the third portion sufficient 
green colouring to bring it to a faint pistachio 
tint, and stir into it an ounce or so of blanched and 
chopped pistachios. At the same time, in houses 
where ices are in great request, if economy forbids 
the purchase of two of Mrs. A. B. Marshall's freezers, 
have, besides one of these, one of Roberts* capital 
little freezers, mentioned before, and use these for 
the water ices. They are so inexpensive that they 
are well worth investing in, at any rate. (Only 
remember that, to insure their being always in 
good order, they must be scrupulously wiped and 
dried each time after use. Of course the same 
remark applies to the more costly machines quite as 
forcibly, but these being of stouter materials do not 
revenge neglect so quickly as do the smaller and 
slighter-made machines.) 

One might easily multiply the above recipes to an 
interminable extent, but these will be sufficient to 
give ideas to any intelligent cook, so with the 
following directions for rather different forms of ice, 
this chapter may be brought to a conclusion. 

Bombe Fleur de Lait. — Line a bombe mould rather 
thickly with raspberry or red currant water ice 
(a little Italian meringue added to this adds greatly 
to its smoothness) then fill up the centre with very

Fasteque a VOrientale. — Peel a large grtuMi-Hewhed 
water melon {pasteque), also removing the inner 
hard white rind, and then slice the fleHh horizontally, 
removing the seeds ; dust each slice generously with 
finely crushed sugar candy, and either rum, cham- 
pagne, or any delicate liqueur to taste, then replace 
the fruit into shape and set it in the ice cave until 
frozen, and serve either on a bed of cotton wool or a 
water border mould. Another way of serving the 
paeteque is simply to cut a generous slice o\it» <il \t^

remove the seeds with a spoon, and replace them 
with a lump of pure ice, replace the portion cut out, 
and put the melon on ice, or in the ice cave till quite 
cold. In hot weather there are few more delicious 
forms of natural fruit ice. A glorified version of 
this is to fill the interior of the fruit with creme 
merge, made thus : to a quart of sweetened single 
cream add a good handful of candied orange flowers, 
bring it slowly to the boil, and allow it to simmer 
very very lightly till nicely flavoured ; then let it 
stand till perfectly cold, when it is frozen in the 
usual way. Any kind of melon can be treated by 
either of the above recipes, whilst large juicy pears, 
or bananas can be treated a Vorientale. 

Coupe Jack. — This is an ice often seen abroad, 
served on all sorts of occasions, sometimes even as 
a sorbet. It consists of two kinds of ices, piled in 
layers in a glass or ice cup or tazza, blanched and 
shred almonds, pistachios, or other nuts, together 
with any dried or crystallized fruit, cut small, 
marinaded with liqueur, wine, or spirit, being strewed 
plentifully between the layers of ice, one of which 
(if not both) is always rather strongly flavoured 
with liqueur, or liqueur syrup. 



CHAPTEE V. 

ICED PUDDINGS, &c. 

Iced puddings are usually, and roughly speaking, 
simply more or less rich forms of custard mixed with 
different flavourings and fruit, either fresh, preserved, 
or glace. Of these there are a great variety, but the 
best known is the Nesselrode, also known as a cold 
im-iced pudding, when it is called jouding a la 
diplomate. The ordinary proportions for this are 
one and a haK pints of very rich custard, two table- 
spoonfuls each of liqueur or spirit, and of syrup to 
taste, and 3oz. or 4oz. of fruit cut up small and 
stirred into the mixture a little before you transfer 
it from the freezer to the mould, and the ice cave. 
The fruit used for this purpose should always be 
marinaded for a little with a little caster sugar and 
some spoonfuls of the liqueur or spirit used to 
flavour the custard, which, be it remembered, should 
always be chosen with reference to the fruit to be 
used. (It is well to observe that a little vanilla adds 
in every case to the value of fruit of any kind, when 
used for ices ; this vanilla being quite distinct from, 
and in addition to, any flavouring liqueur that may 
be chosen.) This is a relatively simple version, and 
can be varied ad infinitum^ taking its name froia tl\A 



66 ICES. 

fruit, &c., with which it is mixed ; here, however, 
is Francatelli's recipe, vhich is the true and original 
one. Blanch and peel three dozen chestnuts, then 
stew them in water or syrup till tender enough to 
crush and pulp through the sieve; put this pulp 
into a pan with the yolks of eight eggs, a pint of 
cream, two sticks of vanilla (previously pounded), 
half a pint of pineapple syrup, and a very little salt ; 
stir this all over a slow fire till the custard is 
sufficiently thickened, when you strain it through a 
tammy into a basin. Now shred 4oz. of green 
citron, 6oz. of pineapple (previously simmered in 
some of the syrup), cut into dice, and put these into 
a basin with 6oz. of dried cherries and 40Z. of 
stoned raisins ; pour over this fruit two wineglassfulg 
of maraschino, cover over the basin, and let it all 
soak for several hours. When these are ready pui 
the chestnut cream into the freezer and freeze in the 
usual way. When about three parts frozen mix in 
lightly and quickly the marinaded fruit, and half a 
pint of stiffly whipped cream, freeze it for a little 
longer till like a very stiff batter, when you pour it 
all into the mould and set it in the ice cave for two 
to two and a half hours. Then dip the mould in 
cold water, wipe off any moisture there may be, and 
turn it out, and serve at once. This certainly is a 
delicious pudding ; but the first recipe is very little, 
if at all, less delicate, and certainly less trouble. Of 
coTtrso the success of this pudding depends on the 
richness of the custard (for which, see recipe). 

Angel Pudding (American). — Lightly beat together 
the whites of six eggs, but without frothing thorn. 



ICED PUDDINGS, &c. 67 

mix them smoothly with haK a pound of powdered 
sugar, and then add in a pint of cream ; stir this all 
over the fire in the bain-marie till scalded, but mind 
it does not boil. Now lift it off the fire, and whisk 
it lightly till it is cold, to get it light. (It should be 
lifted horizontally in the spoon not beaten down- 
wards in the usual way, to get as much air into it as 
possible, the process in fact known to French cooks 
as to vanner any sauce). When this cream is cold 
add two good tablespoonfuls of noyeau or mara- 
schino, and freeze (if preferred orange flower or rose 
water can be used instead of the liqueur) . When it is 
frozen to a stiff batter, stir into it some marrons 
glaceSf cut up into not too small pieces, and an 
Italian meringue, made with the whites of two eggs 
whisked to a froth, with a tablespoonful of hot 
syrup. Turn it into a mould and freeze for three to 
four hours. This ice takes rather longer to freeze 
than most. 

Bice Cream Pudding with Cherry Compote. — Boil 
4oz. of rice till soft, with either some strips of lemon 
peel or a piece of stick vanilla, and when it is dry re- 
move the peel and pour over it some good sugar 
syrup flavoured with kirsch liqueur or syrup, and let 
it stand for an hour or more. At the end of this 
time drain off any syrup there may be, mix with the 
rice a gil] of stifl9[y whipped cream, and then stir it 
all into a pint of good vanilla custard frozen to a 
batter, and pack the whole into a mould and freeze 
for two hours. Turn out and serve with a garnish 
of cherries prepared thus : put some ripe and very 
red, stoned cherries into a pan with their ma^^^^t^ ^ 



68 ICES. 

sugar syrup, flavoured with a little finely pared 
lemon rind and a squeeze of juice ; crack the kernels 
and lay them with the cherries, and let it all cook till 
the fruit is quite soft, but not too niashy, then remove 
the peel and put the fruit aside till cold, when you 
flavour it to taste with kirsch liqueur or syrup, and 
set it on ice till wanted. A clove or two may be 
cooked with the cherries if liked. 

Pineapple Pudding, Iced, — Prepare a custard with 
a pint of milk, two or three eggs, and 2oz. or 3oz. of 
sugar ; when sufficiently thickened lift it off the fire 
and whisk it lightly till cold, when you add to it a few 
drops of essence of vanilla, a gill of very stiffly whipped 
cream, and about 4oz. of grated pineapple ; when this 
is all whisked together, stir into it 2oz. of crystaUized 
pineapple (previously marinaded in a spoonful each 
of lemon juice and brandy for two or three hours), 
and pack it all into the mould and set in the ioe 
cave. If liked, a pine mould may be used for this 
pudding; in this case, colour a little of the cream 
with a few drops of green, and fill the crown of the 
mould with this, adding a few drops of apricot 
yellow to the rest to bring it to the right pineapple 
tint. If the flavour of the pine is not quite 
strong enough, you can add two or three drops of 
essence of pineapple, but these essences are rather 
like colourings, if the least overdone they vulgarize 
and spoil the whole thing. 

Savoy Pudding. — Have ready one and half pints 
of custard (the richness of this depends on the use to 
which you mean to put the pudding; the same as 
used for the pineapple one is very nice for ordinary 



ICED PUDDINGS, Ac. 69 

purposes), and pour this hot on to 8t>z. of ISavoy 
biscuits, grated or finely crumbled, and wlien iJiia is 
cold stir into into it 2oz. or 3oz. of crystallizi^d or 
dried cherries (or sultanas), and either a winejflassf ul 
of liqueur syrup, or the same quantity of slu^rry and 
lemon juice mixed (if for a more expensive pudding 
stir in a gill of whipped cream and use half a gill of 
liqueur to taste). This is very pretty as it stands, but 
can be coloured a faint pink if liked. Mould and 
freeze as usual. For these puddings it may bo 
observed that the simpler the mould the better the 
effect. Nothing looks nicer than a plain charlotte 
or a plain hexagonal mould. To this may bo added, 
when turned out, a little flavoured and frozen cream 
with a rose pipe, together with a few (jrystalliz(*d fruits 
marinaded in lemon juice and liqueur or wine, Sui, 

Boyal Pudding. — Have residy 3oz. each of French 
plums and of greengages, and 2oz. of apricots or 
white pears, and crystallized cherries. Take one and 
a haK pints of cold rich custard, stir to it a gill of 
stiffly whipped cream, and then colour half with a 
ew drops of carmine, leaving the other half plain. 
Stir into the pink half the pears pr the apric^>ts cut 
up, and half the plums and greengages, and into the 
white half all the cherries and the rest of the plums, 
<&c. Freeze as usual, and pack into the mould in 
layers of varying colour. 

Banana Pudding. — ^Peel and slice ar^'oss six or 
eight good bananas, and marinade them with a little 
sugar, lemon juice, and rum or brandy. Hare j 
one a half pints of rich custard, and freeze it ■• 
a thickish batter, then 2A\ \a SX» Via^i ^ \vdX» ^

whipped cream, a little of the same liqueur or spirit 
as was used to marinade the bananas, and lastly stii 
in the fruit. Pack it all into a mould, and freeze. 
Turn out, and serve with more bananas marinaded 
as before, and stand on ice or in the ice cave till 
nearly frozen. This mixture is often served in large 
banana skins carefully stripped off the original fruit, 
J and then piled up on a dish. 

Plum Pudding Olace. — Have ready about a quart 
of chocolate cream ice (made with very rich custard), 
also three-quarters of a pound of mixed fruit, such 
as seeded raisins and currants (previously stewed in 
a little sheiTy and water till plump), very thinly 
shred citron peel, a few dried cherries halved, and 
some blanched and shred almonds. All these should 
have been previously marinaded for a hour or two in 
a little brandy and lemon juice. When the chocolate 
cream is frozen to a batter, mix in the fruit lightly 
drained, and mix it all for a minute or so in the 
freezer, till thoroughly blended, when you mould 
and finish off in the ice cave. Choose a basin or plum 
pudding mould for this. Serve plain, with a sprig 
of holly (this is a capital pudding for an Australian 
or an Indian Christmas), or with the following sauce : 
Flavour half a pint of sweetened cream with a good 
liqueur- glassful of brandy and half a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and freeze to a stiff batter, mix in rather 
more than a gill of stiffly whipped cream and a little 
more brandy, if necessary, and fi.nish freezing.

boiliog cream, 5oz. or 6oz. of sugar, and a little 
vanilla, either stick or essence. Toss in a sugar 
boiler two pottles of ripe and very red strawberries, 
with 6oz. or 7oz. of caster sugar, till they all begin 
to simmer, then add it to the hot custard and rub it 
all through a tammy ; freeze in the usual way, then 
mould and freeze in the ice cave, and serve garnished 
with a macedoine of strawberries, or other fruit, on 
which you have poured some liqueur flavoured hot 
syrup, and when cold set it on ice till wanted. 

Pudding a la Parisienne. — Blanch and skin 
8oz. of Jordan almonds and 2oz. of bitter, dry on a 
clean cloth, mince, and pound them in a mortar with 
12oz. of sugar to a smooth paste ; now put this in a 
pan with the yolks of eight eggs and a quart of 
boiling cream, and stir it all together in the bain 
marie over the fire till it thickens nicely ; then rub 
it through a tammy and freeze to a stiff batter ; now 
pack it in a mould (one with a pipe, or a Trois f r^res 
mould is best for this) and set it in the ice cave. 
When turned out garnish it with a comp6te of 
apricots (for this stew the apricots in syrup till 
soft, or, if tinned ones are used, steep them with 
their own liquid, previously boiled with a little more 
sugar, and when cold poured over the fruit), add a 
glass of noyeau to this, and arrange it round the 
mould or till up the centre with the compote. 

Pudding a V Orange Olace. — Make a custard with 
the juice of four or five good oranges, the well- 
beaten yolks of six eggs, and a pint of single ox a 

or new milk, with 3oz. or 4oz. of caster i

thickens, then freeze to a stiff batter. Now mix into 
it half a pint of stiffly whipped cream, two table- 
spoonfuls of cura9oa, and two or three Tangerine 
oranges, freed from pith and pips, divided up into 
their natural divisions, and well marinaded with a 
little curacoa or brandy, lemon juice, and caster 
sugar. Pack this in a mould and freeze ; turn out 
and serve garnished with orange pigs, freed from 
pith and pips, sprinkled with cura9oa and sugar, and 
then dipped in sugar boiled to the crack. 

Empress Bice, — Put 3oz. of rice on with enough 
cold water to cover it, bring this to the boil, rinse 
well in cold water, then put it on with a pint of 
single cream or new milk, 3oz. of caster sugar, and 
the finely pared rind of a lemon ; let it boil tiU the 
rice is tender, then lift out the lemon peel, and when 
cool add to the rice half a pint of stiffly whipped 
cream, put it into a border mould, or a mould with a 
pipe, and set it in the ice cave for two or three hours. 
Serve with a rich macedoine of any kind of mixed 
fruit, frozen in liqueur flavoured syrup, or with a 
good compote of fruit to taste, or whipped cream 
mixed with mashed strawberries, and set in the cave 
until perfectly cold. 

Any rich rice, semolina, rice flour, or other 
cereal pudding is nice if frozen in the cave and 
served with an iced compote, and makes a great and 
wholesome treat for the children. Fruit fools, 
thickened with a little custard or whipped cream, 
can be first frozen and then moulded with excellent 
effect, especially if served with a compote of any 
kind of fruit 



ICED PUDDINGS, &c. 73 

Plonibiere de /raises (Mrs. A. B. Marshall). — 
Freeze one pint of strawberry water ice till quite dry, 
and one of vanilla custard or creaui ice ; line a tall

two hours ; dip in cold water, and serve on a layer 
of teased-out wadding. 

Ponding Tutti Frutti. — Make an Italian meringue 
with one white of eg^ and a little sugar syrup ; and 
also make a custard with the yolks of eight to ten 
eggs, one and haK pints of new milk or single cream, 
and 6oz. to 8oz. of sugar ; when this is sufficiently 
thickened, three-parts freeze, then add to it the 
meringue, a gill of maraschino, and lastly a few 
drops of essence of cinnamon. Again freeze it, then 
stir in haK a pint of stiffly whipped cream and loz. 
each of pistachios, blanched and shredded, dried 
cherries, and candied citron and orange peel, all cut

whites of Italian meringue, again freeze it, and when 
all but ready stir in 6oz. to 8oz. of preserved fruit, 
previously cut into dice and marinaded with lemon 
juice, and liqueur or spirit to taste. Freeze a

riomhiere aux amandes. — Blanch and peel 6oz. of 
Jordan almonds with ten bitter ones, dry them well 
on a clean cloth, and pound them to a smooth paste, 
adding a little milk to prevent their oiling. When 
brought to a soft paste, mix this with one and a half 
pints of boiled cream, and tammy ; put the result 
into a delicately clean stewpan with the yolks of four 
large or five small eggs, and 6oz. of caster sugar, and 
stir this over the fire (without allowing it to boil) 
till it begins to thicken, then draw it to the side, and 
stir it three minutes longer. Again tammy it, and 
freeze three parts, when you add to it thi-ee- quarters 
of a pint of whipped cream, ref reeze, and lastly set it 
either in a Breton cake mould, or in three border 
or charlotte moulds of proportionate sizes. Freeze 
for two hours in the cave; then turn out, set one

little, then add a gill each of curacoa and maraschino, 
and again freeze. Lastly, add haK a pint of stifBly 
whipped cream, and mould it ; leave it in the ice 
cave for an hour or two. Serve plain, or with iced 
whipped cream, slightly flavoured with liqueur. 

Ponding Glace a VAmericaine. — Stone a quart of 
damsons, crack the stones and put the kernels with 
the fruit ; add haK a pound of sugar, and pour a 
quart of boiling water on it all ; add a few drops of 
carmine, and when cold, tammy ; add a wineglassful 
of kirsch, and freeze to a batter. Line a melon 
mould an inch or so thick with this mixture, and 
when fairly set (in the ice cave), fill it up with the 
following : Blanch and pound one pound of Barce- 
lona nuts with a few almonds or walnuts, and stir 
this into a pint of whipped and sweetened cream, 
stir in J^oz. dissolved isinglass or leaf gelatine, with a 
dessertspoonful of noyeau, then close the mould, and 
leave in the ice cave for an hour or two before 
turning out. 



CHAPTEE VI. 

MOSCOVITES. 

The peculiarity of tbe Moscovite — or, to give it its 
proper name, the creme a la Moscovite — consists in 
tlie fact that, though iced from long burying in ice, 
it is not actually frozen, and owes some of its solidity 
to a certain proportion of either isinglass or leai 
gelatine. It is, in consequence, decidedly to be 
recommended to such housekeepers as may not h&re 
freezing conveniences and yet wish to obey the 
dictates of fashion at the moment, which demand the 
presence of an iced sweet on every carefully arranged 
menu. The preparation partakes more or less of the 
character of a havarois, or cream, flavoured to taste, 
and then iced. If the Moscovite is to be made in 
the approved style, by burying it in ice and salt, the 
mould used must, naturally, be much the same as 
the old-fashioned ice mould — i.e,, one with a tightly. 
fitting lid, and for the same reason, viz., to avoid 
contamination from the salted ice used in freezing 
the mixture. In reality almost any rich custard or 
creme can be used to make a Moscovite if from half 
to three-quarters of an ounce of gelatine be added 
to the pint of custard, and the whole, after moulding, 
he buried in ice for at least two kourn ; the great 



MOSCOVITBS. 77 

thing to remember is that the gelatine (which must 
be of the very first quality) must be allowed to cook 
in the custard (of course, without boiling) to ensure 
its being thoroughly melted and blended with the 
rest of the ingredients, or it will become lumpy, and 
have a raw, rough taste. 

Delicacy both of flavouring, and of colouring, when 
colours are used, is indispensable, and the particular 
substance from which the Moscovite takes its name 
should stand out unmistakably, though daintily. 

The following is a very useful form for this dish, 
as with it almost any kind of fruit Moscovite may b« 
made. Sieve finely a pound of any good jam, or 
prepare a pint of puree from any kind of fresh or 
canned fruit, sweetened with 3oz. to 4oz. of sugar. 
Now make a rich custard with haK a pint of boiled 
new milk or single cream, the yolks of i'our eggs, and 
a few drops of vanilla; cook this in the usual way 
till it " drapes " (i.e., coats rather thickly) the spoon 
used in stirring it, and dissolve in it Joz. of best 
leaf gelatine, stirring it all together over the fire but 
without letting it boil, which would curdle the eggs ; 
then lift it off the fire and stand it to cool ; when the 
gelatine ha^> perfectly dissolved and become amalga- 
mated with the custard, stir into it tJie fruit 
pulp, adding if necessary a little more caster sugar ; 
Qow set the pan containing this mixture on ice, and 
whip it till cold and beginning to set, when you stir 
quickly into it half a pint of stiflfliy whipped cream, 
a, glass of noyeau or any liqueur to taste, and the 
strained juice of a lemon ; then pack it in the mould, 
and bury this in a pail filled with a mixture ot icA

and salt in the same proportions as for the freezing 
tub — i.e., two parts ice to one of salt; a sheet of 
paper should be placed over the custard, and the lid 
of the mould pressed tightly down over this ; if the 
mould have no lid, lay the paper over it as before, 
cover it with a bright stewpan lid, or a very clean 
bating sheet, and pile the same freezing mixture on 
this as there is in the pail, leave it buried thus for 
3ne and a half to two or more hours, then dip the 
mould in barely tepid water, wipe off any moisture 
with a clean cloth, turn out and serve. This form 
of Moscovite may be made with any fruit pulp, 
fresh or canned, such as strawberries, raspberries, 
apricots, <fcc., as you please. 

Moscovite a V Alice. — Stone twenty-four good ripe 
greengages, cracking the stones, and pounding the 
kernels ; mix these with the fruit and half a pound of 
caster sugar, pour on to it a quart of boiling water, 
with an ounce of dissolved gelatine, cover the basin, 
and let it all stand till nearlv cold. Now rub it all 
through a tammy with a wineglassful of maraschino 
or noyeau, and mould in a fancy border mould. 
A drop or two of green colouring may be added to 
bring it all to a delicate pale green tint. When 
quite cold and set, turn out and serve with the 
centre filled with stiffly whipped cream into which 
you have stirred the blanched and chopped ke<mels 
of twenty to thirty walnuts. Of course, if convenient 
this cream may be frozen.

three lemons, and three oranges, pulp three ripe 
bananas and half a tin of canned apricots, moistening

a bare pint of water ; add to this 8oz. to lOoz. of 
sugar, and an ounce of leaf gelatine dissolved in 
a little boiling water, with sufficient cognac and 
maraschino to flavour it all nicely ; then mould, and 
burv in ice as before. Of course, if you have an ice 
cave the Moscovite can be iced in this even more 
easily. Serve with whipped or frozen cream, 
sweetened and flavoured to taste. 

M, aux Avelines, — Blanch, drain, and dry 4oz. of 
filberts, and bake them just long enough to crisp 
without colouring them very much ; when cold 
pound them, adding a spoonful of new milk or cream 
now and again. To this paste pour five glasses 
(containing rather more than a third of a pint each) 
of boiling mUk, or single cream, cover it closely, and 
let it stand till only just lukewarm ; meanwhile beat 
lightly the yolks of eight eggs, and with the nut- 
flavoured milk, and 8oz. of sugar, make a custard, 
dissolving in it about half an ounce of best leaf 
gelatine, then when cold, mouhl and set in the usual 
way. This can also be made with almonds, using 
6oz. of sweet, and ^oz. of bitter almonds. 

M, au Cafe, — On to 4oz. to 6oz. of freshly roasted 
and slightly bruised Mocha coffee berries pour a pint 
of single cream, and let it infuse for an hour at the 
side of the stove, but without boiling; whilst infusing 
dissolve in it ^oz. leaf gelatine and 3oz. of sugar, 
and when these are perfectly blended with the coffee 
cream, tammy it all, and when cold stir into it a gill 
of stifliy whipped cream, then mould and finish off 
as before. Serve with very ripe and red 8tr»»^\scrtv5'j^,

cherries, or raspberries, previously marinaded wr 
sugar and maraschino, and stood on ice till perfect 
cold. This ice should be of a perfectly white coloi] 
and has a peculiarly delicate flavour. 

Another way of making this is to add half a te 
cupful of strong black cofEee to a quart of boilii 
new milk, together with lOoz. of sugar, and rath 
more than ^oz. of leaf gelatine, let it stand till near 
cold and setting, then stir into it quickly and light 
one and a half pints of stiffly whipped cream and 
liqueur-glassful of best cognac or maraschino, ai 
finish as usual. This, of course, is of a da] 
colour. 

M. de chocolat a la Mexicaine. — Break 4oz, 
Cadbury's Mexican Chocolate into a delicately cle£ 
pan, and place it at the side of the range to let it me] 
being careful the heat is not too great ; as soon as 
melts stir it till smooth with a very little single crea 
or new milk, and then add it to a quart of rich vanil 
custard in which you have previously dissolved rathi 
more than loz. of leaf gelatine, and when co 
and nearly setting mix in from a gill to half 
pint of stiffly whipped cream flavoured with vaniH 
and mould and ice as before. Serve plain, or wit 
the following sauce : Infuse half a split vanilla po 
for fifteen or twenty minutes in rather less than ha 
a pint of single cream or new milk, with 2oz. < 
caster sugar ; then pour this on to the yolks of s: 
eggs, and stir it over the fire till it thickens to tl 
consistency of good cream, when you sieve it ; tht 
pour it on the stiffly whipped whites of three egg 
and whip it all well together, adding ten or fifte<

drops of essence of vanilla and a spoonful of mara- 
schino liqueur or syrup, and stand on ice till wanted. 
This sauce, which is one of Mrs. A. B. Marshall's, is 
equally good cold or hot. 

Jf. a la creme hruUe. — ^Put two good tablespoon- 
fuls of best loaf sugar in a stewpan and leave it till 
it begins to burn and brown ; then shake the pan about 
well, put into it an ounce of ratafie biscuits, a small 
piece of thinly pared lemon rind, sugar to taste, and 
a spoonful or so of orange flower water ; stir this all 
well together, then add to it a pint of boiled new 
milk or single cream, and let it simmer very gently 
at the side of the stove for twenty minutes ; now lift 
the pan off the fire, stir into it half a pint of very 
thick cream, and when well blended pour it on to the 
yolks of six and the whites of four well beaten eggs, 
and stir it all over the fire till it thickens ; dissolve 
in it an ounce of l)est leaf gelatine, and when it 
drapes the spoon lift it out, and mould it as it cools 
and begins to set. When iced turn out and serve 
with a macedoine of fruit or an iced puree of straw- 
berries, made thus: pound together one pound of 
strawberries and haK a pound of caster sugar, the 
juice of one lemon, a wineglassful of white rum, and 
a few drops of carmine, rub it all through a sieve, and 
stand on ice till wanted. 

M, a la creme au caramel, — Put into a stewpan 
2oz. of caster sugar, a liqueur-glassful of white rum,

you have previously dissolved an ounce of leaf 
gelatine, and when cold, mould and finish off as 
before. 

M, aux Framhoises, — Boil loz. of leaf gelatine in 
as little water as possible till dissolved, then add to 
it enough raspberry syrup to flavour and colour it 
wcdl and rather highly ; now add half a pint of white 
wine, 2oz. of caster sugar and a pint of thick cream, 
beat it all well together till quite cold, then mould 
and finish as usual. Or : 

Stalk a pottle of raspberries and a quart of ripe 
red currants and place them in a presei*ving pan 
with one pound of caster sugar and a gill of water ; 
stir it all over the fire till it boils, then let it boil for 
five minutes, carefully removing every particle of 
scum that may rise ; dissolve l^oz. to 2oz. of leaf 
gelatine in it, tammy it, and mould as before. Serve 
with whipped or frozen cream sweetened and flavoured 
to taste. 

M, aux Fleure, — Take roses, violets, jessamine, 
pinks, and orange flowers, and pound them, adding as 
you do so a little milk ; now wring all the juice 
possible from them through a clean cloth, into a pint 
of boiling cream ; add this to the yolks of six eggs, 
with sugar to taste, and let it thicken in the usual 
way, adding to it an ounce of gelatine, and when the 
custard is thick and the gelatine dissolved, rub it all 
through a sieve, and when cool mould and finish off as 
before. Serve with crystallized flowers. 

M. au Maraequin. — Whip a pint of double cream 
till as stiff as possible, then stir into it loz. of best 
leaf gelatine previously dissolved in a very little 



MOSOOYITES. 83 

water, one and a half gills of marascliino, the juice 
of a small lemon, and 4oz. of caster sugar. When 
lightly mixed pour it all into a bombe mould 
previously brushed over with oil of sweet almonds 
(this avoids the necessity of dipping the mould 
into tepid water, for which this cream is too deli- 
cate), and set in ice in the usual way. This Mosco- 
vito, which is a particularly delicate one, can be 
flavoured with any liqueur to taste, and garnished 
with crystallized rose leaves, violets, Ac. Or : 

Boil a quart of milk, then mix into it by degrees 
a grain of salt, lOoz. of caster sugar, and the yolks 
of eight eggs ; stir these all over the fire, and as soon 
as they begin to simmer (they must not boil or the 
eggs will curdle) add foz. of best leaf gelatine, and let 
it dissolve ; when this is thoroughly amalgamated lift 
it from the fire, let it cool, and when cold add a full 
liqueur-glassful of maraschino, and finish off as before. 
This also can be made with any kind of liqueurs. 

M, aux Milles Fruits. — Pound together 4oz. each 
of strawberries, raspberries, and red currants, with 
6oz. of sugar; then mix with it a full ^oz. of best 
leaf gelatine, previously dissolved in three-quarters 
of a pint of warm water, together with the juice of a 
large lemon and a wineglassful of maraschino syrup, 
rub this all through a tammy, add a few drops of 
carmine, if necessary, to bring up the colour, and 
pour it all into a mould, adding if you like some 
l)lanehed and chopped almonds; finish off in the 
usual way or stand it for one and a half hours in the 
ice cave, and serve with whipped cream, sweetened 
and flavoured to taste. K ierw ^0*^1^ A ^^asSaafc^

can be made of any kinds of fruit. 

M, aux Oranges, — Put into a bowl half a pound of 
loaf sugar with the finely shredded rind of eight 
oranges, and |oz. of best leaf gelatine ; pour on to it 
all a pint of absolutely boiling water with a few drops 
of saffron yellow ; let it stand till cool, when you add 
the juice of eight or ten oranges, then sieve it all and 
flavour to taste with cura9oa or orange brandy, and 
mould in the usual way, allowing two hours in the 
ice cave, or three in the ice and salt. Serve with 
whipped or iced cream, flavoured with cura^oa, 
sweetened to taste. Mould in a border mould. 

M. a la creme d' Oranges, — Prepare a custard, as 
given in the chapter on ices, for Tangerine cream ice, 
only adding about l^oz. of gelatine to the quart of 
the mixture, before adding the orange juice, which 
must be put in when the gelatine is thoroughly 
melted, then finish off as before. To serve, turn out 
with a garnish of quartered Tangerine oranges freed 
from skin, pith, and pips, and dipped into boiled 
sugar (see recipe), and used when crisp. This can 
be made with ordinary oranges, but is far more 
delicate when made with Tangerines. 

M. aux Poires. — Peel, core, and quarter a dozen 
good mellow pears, such as jargonelles, and mash 
them well with a new wooden spoon, adding the 
juice of three lemons, sugar to taste, and from ioz. 
to IJoz. of gelatine (according to the quantity of 
pear pur^e) dissolved in as little water as possible, 
and as cool as it can be, short of setting; rub the 
whole through a tammy, add from a gill to half a 



MOSOOVITES. 86 

pint of stiffly whipped cream, and mould as Usual. 
Serve with whipped frozen cream, sweetened and 
flavoured to taste. 

Moscovite aux Pommes. — Peel, core, and slice down 
from one and a half to two pounds of good apples, and 
stew them to a pulp with half a pound of sugar, a 
strip of lemon peel, and a good squeeze of lemon 
juice ; add to it a pot of apricot marmalade, and a 
full pint of boiling cream; dissolve in this about 
foz. of best leaf gelatine, and, as it is cooling, rub it 
all through a sieve, stir to it a gill of stiffly whipped 
cream, and mould and ice as usual. A very few 
drops of green colouring may be added if the apples 
require it, just before sieving, but it should be kept 
a very faint green. 

M. pralinee aux Fruits. — ^Make a custard with 
one and a half pints of single cream or new milk, 
3oz. of caster sugar, a very few drops of essence of 
lemon, and the yolks of six large or seven small 
eggs ; stir it over the fire till it thickens (when ready 
it should " drape" — i.e., hang in a sort of sheet from 
the spoon), dissolving in it at the same time an ounce 
of leaf gelatine, and as soon as this is perfectly 
amalgamated with the custard lift the pan from the 
fire and keep stirring it horizontally all the time till 
all but cold. Now whip it well, mixing into it as you 
do so, gradually and lightly, 2oz. of powdered praline, 
a gill of stiffly whipped cream, and a liqueur-glassful 
of kirsch or maraschino ; pour it into a mould and 
ice as before, serving it with a rich compote of any 
nice fruit, such as strawberries, cherries, ^vy^

the quantity to a rough powder and use as directed, 
stirring in the quarter part as it is. 

M, au Punch — ^Put half a pound of sugar into a 
basin and on to it squeeze the juice of four good 
lemons, add to this the thinly pared rind of two 
lemons, with rather more than an ounce of best leaf 
gelatine, and half a pint of water ; let this all boil 
gently together till reduced to half, then strain it 
into a basin and leave till cold. Mix two wine- 
glassfuls each of rum punch and maraschino, with 
half a glassful of brandy, into a pint of very rich 
custard, and stir it over the fire till thick ; now mix 
it with the dissolved gelatine, lemon juice, &c., add 
a pint of stiffly whipped cream, and mould and ice 
as before. The amount of gelatine to be added to 
this Moscovite is not easy to fix, so the best way is 
to ice a little before adding in the cream. 

M, aux Beines Claudes. — Stone and cut up four 
or five-and-twenty fine ripe greengages, and cook 
them in 4oz. of sugar till tender enough to pulp 
easily through a sieve ; then boil four glasses of milk 
with 6oz. of sugar and a grain of salt, pour this on 
to the yolks of eight eggs, stirring it with a new 
wooden spoon over a gentle fire till it thickens ; add 
to it a good ^oz. of leaf gelatine, and as soon as this 
is thoroughly dissolved sieve it all, let it cool a little,

you add a gill of stiffly whipped cream, and mould 
and ice as usual. This is one of the creams that 
need their mould brushed over with oil of sweet 
almonds, as they are too delicate to allow of the use 
of even tepid water in their turning out. 

M. a la Busse, — To one and a half pints stiffly 
whipped cream add 12oz. caster sugar, a wineglassful 
of maraschino (or other liqueur or spirit to taste), 
a good liqueur-glassful of Kiimmel, sixteen drops 
strong essence of vanilla, and l^oz. of isinglass (or 
best leaf gelatine) dissolved in a gill of boiling rose 
water. Beat this mixture well till thoroughly 
amalgamated, mixing in shred pistachios and almonds, 
and sufficient green colouring to bring it to a faint 
green. Mould and freeze. Serve with iced cham- 
pagne sauce, and pink vanilla wafers. For the sauce ; 

Break a fresh egg into a basin with a tablespoonf ul 
of cream, sugar to taste, and a full tumbler of cham- 
pagne. Whip it over a strong ice and salt mixture, 
and it will freeze as you whip. 

(If whipped to a stiff froth over hot water, this 
also makes a delicious hot sauce.) 

M, of Strawberries a la Creme, — Mix a pint of fresh 
strawberry pulp with 4oz. caster sugar, then stir 
into this a pint of rich custard in which you have 
previously dissolved loz. of leaf gelatine, and, lastly, 
half a pint of stiffly whipped cream ; mould and ice as 
usual. Serve with whipped cream, sweetened and 
flavoured with maraschino, into which you have 
lightly stirred half a pound or so of Alpine straw- 
berries, or ordinary ones halved. Of course, if you

CHAPTEE VII. 

SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES. 

Thb chief difference between the ices which form 
the subject of this chapter and the ordinary iced 
pudding, lies in the fact that while for the latter the 
custard, &c., which is its foundation, is frozen first in 
the freezer and then packed in the mould and frozen 
either in a bed of ice and salt, or in the ice cave, the 
former have the mixture of which they are composed 
poured straight into the mould and frozen either in 
the ice bed or cave without a prefatory freezing. In 
this way they are near relations to tho old-fashioned 
**parfait,*' or, as it used also to be called, the 
"biscuit" ice; in fact, the mousse and the parfait 
often do interchange names nowadays, though this 
is, strictly speaking, not correct, as, for the parfait, 
cream alone was to be used, whereas the mousse is 
of the same substance as the souffle, i.e., is made of 
a very light whipped custard. But these old dis- 
tinctions are well-nigh obsolete, save with the veriest 
purists, and it is not always easy to say where the 
line between souffles, parfaits, and mousses is to be 
drawn. Moreover, ordinary ice creams with different 
garnishes, if served in a souffle case, are frequently 
(if mcorreQtly) known Sda soufdtis ^\s\.c4^. T\i^ 



SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES. 89 

mousses came first in order of creation, the souffle 
glace only becoming commoner as the ice cave 
rendered its production easier. We may therefore 
begin with directions for making a mousse. 

Mousse a la Vanille. — Put into a delicately clean 
pan the yolks of six and the whites of two eggs, with 
an ounce of sugar and a teaspoonful of essence of 
vanilla : stand the pan containing this in another 
three pai*ts full of boiling water (the first pan should 
be sufficiently large not to reach more than half-way 
down the second, so as to allow a good supply of 
boiling water under it), and whip the eggs, &c., till 
thick and warm, but not hot ; then lift the pan ofE 
the fire and continue to whip the eggs, &c., till the 
mixture is light, stiff, and perfectly cold ; now add 
to it a stiffly whipped gill of cream, and a little more 
vanilla if necessary, mould, and set it in the ice cave 
for three hours. You generally reckon one egg 
a head in these mousses. 

Mousse aux Fraises. — Put into the pan the yolks 
of eight and the whites of three eggs, with 2oz. of 
caster sugar, haK a teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, 
a full gill of strawberry pulp, and a drop or two of 
carmine, whip it as before till thick and warm, then 
till stiff and cold ; add a gill of stiffly whipped 
cream, and finish off as before. To turn out either 
of these mousses, dip the mould in cold water, and 
turn out gently. 

These two recipes show the way of working, 
according to whether you use liquid flavouring, such 
as vanilla essence, coffee, spirit, liqueur, &c., or a morft 
solid form, such as fruit pxii^, &Ri, "^^ ^^^^ "^^^

observed tliat while for the liqtiid flavouring the egg 
yolks are to the whites in the proportion of three to 
one, in the other case they are in the proportion of 
eight to three, to make up for the greater density of 
the pulp. Bearing this in mind, it is possible to 
make any kind of mousse, and to use any recipe 
given for iced souffles, in which it must be remembered 
that two parts of yolk are used to one of white 
of egg. 

Mousse Ifor, — Beat the yolks of three eggs till 
smooth, then add to them a tablespoonf ul of sugar syrup, 
and stir them well together till the mixture will coat 
the spoon pretty thickly ; now lift it off the fire (re- 
member this mixture should have been beaten over 
boiling water as before), add to it a good dessert- 
spoonful of lemon juice and three tablespoonfuls of 
sherry, and beat it altogether till light and cold ; 
meanwhile make the three whites of eggs into an 
Italian meringue with two tablespoonfuls of boiling 
syrup, previously cooked to the ball (see Italian 
m(5ringue), add this lightly and quickly to the 
mixture, mould, and freeze in the ice cave for three 
hours or so. 

This can be varied by flavouring it with either 
brandy, rum, or liqueur to taste, instead of the 
sherry. 

Mousse au chocolat j^ralinee, — Beat the yolks of 
five eggs over boiling water on the fire till light, 
then whisk in three tablespoonfuls of sugar syrup, 
stirring it (but no longer whisking it) till it thickens 
sufficiently to coat the spoon pretty thickly, then 
turn it into a basin, stir into it goz. of uivaweeteued 



SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES. 91 

chocolate, melted, and a little essence of yanilla, and 
beat it all till cold and stiff ; now add two to three 
tablespoonfuls of praline powder (see recipe) and 
three-quarters of a pint of stiffly whipped cream 
(being careful not to let any moisture that has 
drained from the cream go in), mould, and freeze as 
before. If you have no ice cave, both this and the 
preceding mousse, must be buried in ice and salt for 
fully four, if not five, hours. 

Mousse au Cafe Pralinee is made in the same way, 
using four tablespoonfuls of strong black coffee, in- 
stead of the melted chocolate, and finish as before. 

Mousse au Cassis, — Stew one pound of ripe black 
currants with half a pint of water, 6oz. of caster 
sugar, and a few drops of carmine, till soft enough 
to pulp through a sieve ; put this pur^e into a pan 
with the yolks of twelve and the whites of three eggs, 
3oz. of caster sugar, and a liqueur- glassful of brandy, 
and whip over boiling water, as before, till stiff and 
warm, and then off the fire till cold, when you stir to 
it lightly a good tablespoonful of maraschino liqueur 
(or rather more liqueur syrup) and a pint of stiffly 
whipped cream; mould, and freeze in the cave for 
three to four hours. A delicious Banana Mousse can 
be made in the same way, only using the fruit raw, 
and rubbing it through the sieve with the addition 
of a full claret-glassful of maraschino syrup and a 
sherry-glassful of rum, instead of the water, sweeten- 
ing it with 2oz. of caster sugar, and, if necessary, 
colouring it with a few drops of apricot yellow, and 
just two or three drops of carmine, to bring the 
colour to a rich orange (\)u\. \>^ «vxx^ ^oX* \ft <^<a5x^^

this !), and flnisli off exactly as for the mousse au 
cassis. It will take six or seven nice ripe bananas. 

Mousse au Citron. — Grate off the yellow part of 
two nice fresh lemons on l|oz. of loaf sugar, and 
crush this pretty fine; now halve the lemons and 
strain off all the juice into a pan with the crushed 
sugar, the yolks of five and the whites of two eggs, 
with l|oz. of very thinly shred candied peel, and 
after mixing this well over boiling water till thick 
and warm, beat it off the fire till cold and stiff, add 
a gill of stiffly whipped cream and a liqueur-glassful 
of lemon brandy, mould as usual, and freeze. 

Biscuits glaces a la Creme. — Have ready some 
paper cases (formerly these were always square, and 
made at home, of thick white paper), and fill them 
with any mousse mixture to taste, after adding the 
whipped cream, &c., and set them in the ice cave for 
one and a half to two hours ; when ready to serve 
press out on to each, with a rose pipe, a little suitably 
flavoured whipj^d cream, or place rockily upon it 
any nice frozen cream, such as crime vierge, or angel 
cream ice, and serve. 

The above are quite sufficient to give a good idea 
of mousses, and will enable any averagoly intelligent 
cook to vary her dishes to any extent she pleases, 
always remembering that if an egg white or two 
more be added to each recipe, any of these can be 
served as souffles, either laige or small. Again, a 
very pretty iced dish may be made by moulding any 
of the above in small individual moulds, and then 
dishing them on and in a border of any nice water 
jce to taste. For instance, mould souio oi ^;^xvi\vimou 



SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES. 93 

and coffee mousses in little ballette moulds, and 
serve in a border of cherry water ice flavoured with 
kirsch ; or chocolate pralin^ and strawberry mousses 
in a lemon border, &c. 

For souffles, have ready a souffle dish well papered, 
as for an ordinary souffle, and if you have no silver 
case in which to slip it when ready, have at hand a 
damask napkin or doyley to pin round it at once 
before serving. Be careful in removing the paper 
round it, for, if dragged, it will probably break off 
pieces of the mixture, and any way will make it look 
ragged and untidy. Always be sure to have at hand 
anything required for garnishing the souffle, such as 
chopped almonds or pistachios, chopped angelica, 
biscuit crumbs, roughly crushed chocolate, &c. ; for, 
once the souffle is ready, it should be sent to table. 
If it has to stand, leave it in the cave with the paper 
band round it. As said before, there is little 
difference between mousses and souffles, save the 
moulding and the fact that an extra egg white or 
two should be used for the latter, in which the pro- 
portion is half the number of whites that you xise 
of yolks. 

Souffle au Cafe. — Put into a basin the yolks of 
ten eggs, the whites of five, and 3oz. to 4oz. of caster 
sugar; whip this as before over boiling water till 
thick and warm, then off the fire till cold and stiff ; 
now stir into it six tablespoonfuls of good strong 
black coffee, or two tablespoonfuls of essence of 
coffee, and add to it a gill of stiffly whipped cream ; 
pour the mixture into a papered souffle case (this 
case should have been set in tW c^T^<e^\Rfe ^sas^^i **g^

perfectly oold), and freeze in the ice cave for about 
three hours. 

Souffli au Cognac, — Put into a pan the yolks of 
eight and the whites of four eggs, and rather better 
than an ounce of castor sugar, with a liqueur- glassful 
of brandy ; whip this, as before, over boiling water 
till thick and warm, and then off the fire till cold 
and stiff ; then add to it four good tablespoonf uls of 
stiffly whipped cream, and finish as before. 

SouflSs can be made thus, and flavoured with any 
liqueur to taste, and if liked a few strawberries, or 
any fruit to taste, can be mixed with the souffle 
mixture, after being marinaded in sugar, and the 
same liqueur as the souffle is to be flavoured with. 
Mind the fruit is well drained before adding it to 
the mixture, and well dusted with caster sugar, or it 
will sink to the bottom. Of course in this case the 
soufflt^ takes its name from the liqueur used. 

8oufflS d la MilanaUe, — Beat the yolks of six eggs 
over boiling water with 2oz. or 8oz. of caster sugar 
till warm and thick, then ofE the fire till cold and 
stifE, when you add to it an Italian meringue of threo 
egg whites, the finely grated rind of four and the 
strained juice of three lemons, and lastly half a pint 
of stiffly whipped cream. Serve in a papered case, 
frozen as before. This makes a very delicious sweet 
if loz. of best leaf gelatine dissolved in a little 
brandy or sherry be added with the whipped cream, 
&c., and instead of freezing, the mould is placed in a 
cold corner on ice till quite set. 

Souffle aux Ghroseilles, — Top and tail one and a half 
pounds of nice green goosobeTT\ea» «k5id «^^ ^o^m 



SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES, 95 

mth a short gill of water, the juice of a lemon, and 
6oz. to 8oz. of caster sugar, till tender enough to 
tammy, Add a drop or two of green colouring, if 
necessary, and when cold stir into it an Italian 
meringue of four e^g whites, one pint of stitfty 
whipped and sweetened cream, and a liquour-ghisaful 
of ^maraschino or brandy, as you please, pour it all 
into a papered soufidc case, and freeze for three hours 
in the ice cave. 

Souffle au Pain Bis. — Put into a pan the yolks of 
eight and the whites of f oiu* eggs, with a teaspoonf ul 
of vanilla, 2oz. or 3oz. of caster sugar, and 4oz. of 
brown bread crumbs (rather finely grated and 
previously mixed with vanilla, and a liqueur-glassful 
of brandy) ; whip it as before till thick and warm, and 
then till cold and stiff ; add to it three-quarters to 
one pint of stiffly whipped cream, pour it all into a 
papered souffle case, and freeze for three to four 
hours, and serve. 

This souffle is very nice, if after papering the 
mould you put a bottle or a tin in the centre, fill up 
the space between the bottle and the souffle case with 
the brown bread mixture, set it in the ice cave for 
three to four hours, then remove the bottle by slip- 
ing a hot knife round it, and fill up the centre with 
an iced compote of strawberries. For this, stalk the 
strawberries, and if large halve them, and pour on to 
them a boiling syrup made by boiling down 8oz. of 
loaf sugar and a pint of water to half, then adding 
to it a liqueur-glassful of maraschino, let them stand 
till cold, then place them on ice till wanted. Auy 
fruit can be ujsed if treated m i\uA ixvBjixket.

Souffle aux Mandarins, — Rub the peel ofp six 
Mandarin oranges (these are a rather larger kind of 
Tangerine orange), with about 5oz. of loaf sugar, 
and after lightly crushing this, place it in a pan 
with the yolks of ten and the whites of five eggs, and 
whip it tiU warm and thick ; then ofE the fire beat it 
till cold and stiff, when you add to it a liqueur- 
glassful of cura9oa, the juice (strained) of the 
oranges, and half a pint of stiffly whipped cream, 
freeze as usual. Serve with a compote made by 
peeling and removing aU pith from four or five 
oranges, dividing these up into their natural 
divisions, sprinkling them liberally with cura90a 
syrup (or cura9oa liqueur diluted with orange juice, 
and a generous sprinkle of sugar), and stand in the 
ice cave till wanted. 

8ouffl6 Panache, — For this put into a pan the 
yolks of ten and the whites of five eggs, with 4oz. of 
caster sugar and a little vanilla ; beat this till warm 
and thick over the fire, then divide this custard into 
two parts and stir into one half, haH a gill of Mocha 
coffee (prepared by infusing loz. of freshly roasted 
Mocha coffee berries in a short gill of single cream) ; 
into the other half stir a gill of fresh strawberry 
pulp, and then add into each of these, after beating 
them till cold and stiff, a good half gill of stiffly 
whipped cream ; put this in alternate layers into the 
souffle case and freeze as before. Mind when freezing 
these souffles to turn them occasionally in the ice cave 
or they will freeze crooked. The mixture can be 
flavoured to taste with any fruit, liqueur, &c. 

Souffle aux Macarons. — Crush half a pound of 



SOUFFLES AND MOUSSES. 97 

nice macaroons (cocoanut ones make a very good 
souffle) and stir them into four or five tablespoonf uls 
of maraschino or noyeau syrup, a small liqueur- 
glassful of brandy, and half a teaspoonful of essence 
of vanilla ; let these crumbs steep in this for fifteen 
or twenty minutes, then mix them with a pint of 
stiffly whipped cream, and an Italian meringue made 
with sugar, and the whites of three eggs ; stir this all 
together, put it into a papered souffle case, and freeze 
from three to four hours in the cave. Serve with 
rum compote (see recipe) previously iced. 

This is equally good made with brown bread 
crumbs. 

Souffle a la Vanille. — Make this exactly like the 
foundation of the souffle panache, only, instead of 
dividing it, flavour the whole with essence of vanilla 
and use. Maraschino, cura9oa, kirsch, &c., can all 
be used for flavouring these souffles, which then take 
their names from the flavouring used. If you use 
kirsch, serve with a compote of stoned cherries pre- 
pared like the strawberries given above, adding to 
the fruit some of their kernels, nicely blanched. A 
little noyeau can also be added. 

Sovffle de Punch a la Frangaise. — ^Infuse 2oz. of 
good tea in a pint of perfectly freshly boiled water, 
then strain it off and leave it to cool. In the mean- 
time whip five yolks and two whites of eggs with 
3oz. of sugar over boiling water till thick and warm, 
then off the fire till cold and stiff ; now add to it the 
strained juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful of good 
rum, and la^tlv the cold strained tea. TVsftTJL^^scL'

and freeze in a papered souffle case for three to four 
hours. 

The above hints will show how souffles glacds are 
made, and, of course, the flavourings may be varied 
ad infinitum. 

The following sweets, extremely nice in their way, 
hardly deserve the name of souffles, having really 
nothing of a souffle but the case ; still, as they are 
very good, easy to make, and go under that name, 
they are here included : — 

Souffle a V Alexandra. — Prepare a rich chocolate 
cream ice made with whipped cream (or a rAmeri- 
caine, with a pint of scalded cream, to which half 
way through you add 2oz. of rich vanilla chocolate 
dissolved in a little single cream, and a gill of stiffly 
whipped cream) and an apricot sorbet (see recipe). 
Fill the third part of a papered souffle case with the 
chocolate ice, then lay in the apricot sorbet, and 
lastly fill up with more chocolate. Freeze three to 
four hours in the cave, and serve garnished with 
crystallized apricots. 

Souffle a VElo'ise. — Have ready a rich vanilla cream 
ice, and also some angel cream ice into which you 
have mixed some cherries stoned and marinaded in 
kirsch, lemon juice, and sugar, and fill up in layers 
as in the preceding. 

Souffle a la Kaiser. — Prepare a rich almond 
praline cream ice, mix into it finely shred candied 
citron, lemon, and orange peel, with a liqueur-glassful 
of any liqueur to taste, and freeze as usual. 

Souffle a la St. Georges. — Two-thirds fill a papered 
soiif^^ case with a strawberry ISio^]La«fe,^^el!L^!l\\l^^^

rather higli witli a mousse au marasquin, into wMch 
you have mixed some ripe and very red strawberries 
previously marinaded in maraschino and sugar. 
(Alpine strawberries give the best flavour.) 

Souffle a la Venus. — ^Arrange in a papered souffle 
case alternate layers of rum mousse mixture {see 
" Souffle au Cognac ") and ginger cream ice made 
with whipped cream. G-arnish with small pieces of 
preserved ginger sprinkled with rmn.

CHAPTER VIII. 

PAEFAITS AND SPONaADAS. 

The parfait is in reality wliipped and frozen cream 
flavoured to taste ; it is fairly easy to make (granted 
an ice cave), as the flavouring is simply added to the 
whipped cream, the whole poured into a mould, and 
then either buried in ice and salt, or placed in the ice 
cave for three to four hours. The only difficulty lies 
in the turning out, which needs practice, and must be 
done very carefully. From the fact that the cream is 
whipped till dry before the flavouring is added this 
sweet is very light, and this lightness is its dis- 
tinguishing characteristic. It originated in an age 
when cream was not so expensive as it is nowadays, 
and when the housewife, even if economically 
natured, did not hesitate to use eggs, milk, and 
cream freely. Now that such points have to be con- 
sidered by all but the most wealthy, half custard, 
half cream is the proportion usually adopted, both 
being whipped till stiff first, and then lightly and 
quickly whipped together. Eecipes for both kinds 
will be found below. 

Parfait au CafS, — Put into a delicately clean pan 
the yolks of two eggs, a tablespoonf ul of caster sugar, 
and one-third of a pint of rather strong cold coffee ; 



PARFAITS AND SPONGADAS. 101 

place the pan on the fire and whisk the whole gently 
together till it drapes the whisk, but mind it does 
not boil ; now place it in a basin and whisk it sharplj 
till it is cold and stiff, when you stir into it an equal 
quantity of stiffly whipped cream, beating it all 
lightly together with the whisk, then pour it all into 
a mould and freeze. Or : 

Beat together over hot water the yolks of six eggs 
with 6oz. of caster sugar, till quite warm and thick, 
then lift the pan off the fire, stir into it half a pint of 
ordinary coffee, just on the boil, and continue to beat 
the eggs, &c., till they are cold and creamy. When the 
whole is quite cold and very light, stir into it quickly 
a pint of stiffly whipped cream, mould, and freeze 
for three hours or so. If you bury it in ice and 
salt, be careful to put a weight on the tightly closed 
Ud, or the ice, being so light, will not keep down 
properly. The coffee for this should be used when 
on the point of, though not quite actually, boiling, or 
it ^vill not blend with the eggs, and will come out in 
dark dirty coloured streaks. Any fruit, nut, or other 
flavouring can be used instead of the coffee, and 
makes a very nice dish, though reaUy these are more 
mousses, than parfaits. 

Parfait aux Fruits. — Whip a pint of thick cream 
till verv stiff, then drain it for a few minutes on a 
sieve ; have ready a giU of any fruit pulp to taste, 
strained from its juice, and mixed with enough 
caster sugar to bring it to exactly the same con- 
sistency as the cream ; then mix it lightly into the 
whipped cream with a whisk, add a drop or two 
of flavouring essence if neoeasai^ ^^icc^^sa* -sv^c^'?^'^ 



102 lOES. 

improves all fruit), and a very few drops of colouring 
if required; mould, and freeze for tliree to four 
hours. 

Parfait aux Liqueurs, &c. — Whisk the cream as 
before, then whisk into it four tablespoonfuls of 
caster sugar, and a tablespoonful of either very 
black coffee, or any liqueur such as cura9oa, kirsch, 
&c., or a teaspoonful of vanilla or any such essence, 
to taste ; or an ounce of chocolate dissolved in a very 
little milk or cream, and flavoured with a few drops 
of vanilla ; mould in the usual way, and freeze for 
three to four hours. Remember the sugar depends 
on the flavouring used, liqueurs requiring less than 
chocolate or essence. Of course, the parfait in this 
case takes its name from the liqueur, Ac, with which 
it is flavoured. A delicious parfait, aux mille fruits, 
may be made by preparing a parfait as above, 
flavouring it with a teaspoonful of vanilla, and just 
at the last stirring into it a gill of mixed candied 
fruits, previously cut small and rolled in caster sugar 
to make each piece of fruit dry and separate so as it 
does not sink so quickly in the cream. A variante 
of this is to use marrons glacea instead of the mixed 
fruit, of course altering the name. In this case use 
maraschino, about a liqueur- glassful, with the mixed 
fruit, or a little liqueur brandy with the chestnuts. 

Parfait au pain his a la Japonaise, — Grate finely 
about 4oz. of brown breadcrumbs, and steep them Ib 
a liqueur-glassful or two of maraschino, half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, and a spoonful or so of praline 
powder, and mix it all well together (if necessary add 
a little more maraschino, as the quantity required 



PARE AITS AND SPONGADAS. 103 

depends a good deal on the bread) ; now whisk this 
all lightly into a full pint of very stiffly whipped 
cream, mixed with an Italian meringue of three egg 
whites, mould it all, and freeze for three to four hours. 

Parfait aux Cerises. — Stone a pound of nice red 
cherries, crack and blanch the kernels, and cook 
them altogether for ten minutes with a third of 
a pint of water, and 3oz. caster sugar, then pound 
them all smooth with the juice of one large or two 
small lemons, and a drop or two of carmine to colour; 
pulp it all through a sieve, and mix it lightly and 
quickly into a generous pint of stiffly whipped cream, 
and an Italian meringue of one or two egg whites, 
adding, if liked, a good liqueur-glassful of kirsch, 
mould and freeze. 

Parfait aux Fruits Confits. — Whisk very stiffly 
a quart of thick cream, flavouring it rather strongly 
with noyeau ; cut up an ounce each of candied 
citron and orange peel, loz. of candied apricots 
sliced, and loz. of stoned raisins, and put them all 
into a pan over the fire with a gill of noyeau ; as 
soon as the fruit has absorbed the liqueur, lift the 
pan from the fire, and let them cool ; now put into 
a mould a good layer of the stiffly whipped cream, 
mixed with the fruit ; then crumble over this a layer 
of crushed ratafies, and repeat these layers till the 
mould is full, then freeze at once for two or three 
hours If l^oz. of leaf gelatine is dissolved in 
a little single cream, and stirred into the whipped 
cream, this can be made into a delicious moscovite, or 
a nice custard can be used, enriched with a gill of 
whipped cream, in the same way. 



104 ICES. 

Parfait aux Bananes. — Peel and pound six good 
bananas to a pulp, then moisten with the juice of a 
lemon and an orange, and rub it all through a fine 
sieve ; stir this all into a pint of verj stiffly whipped 
cream, mould, and freeze as before. A liqueur-glass- 
ful of cura9oa, liqueur, or syrup, may be added to 
this with excellent effect. 

Parfait d la creme pralinee, — Melt 4oz. of sugar 
slowly till it turns a rich golden brown, then stii 
into this 4oz. of blanched and shred Jordan almonds, 
and let them also brown in the sugar ; now spread it 
all out on a dish, and, when cold, pound about three- 
quarters of this nougat to a powder, and stir it into 
a pint and a half of stiffly whipped cream, flaTOured 
with noyeau, stirring in the ounce of uncrushed 
praline at the last ; mould and freeze. 

Parfait Panache. — Prepare half a pint each of 
chocolate and vanilla cream (for parfait), being care- 
ful in each case to have the cream very stifflj 
whipped, and drop it lightly into a mould in alter- 
nate spoonfuls, so as to give it a marbled appearance, 
then close the mould and freeze. 

Parfait aux Roses, — To a pint of very stiffly 
whipped cream add an Italian meringue, made with 
two egg-whites and a tablespoonful of syrup, flavoui 
with a liqueur-glassful each of maraschino and rose 
water, stir in quickly and lightly a good handful of 
' crystallized rose leaves ; mould and freeze. This is 
also delicious if orange-flowers and orange flower 
water be used instead of the roses, of course, chang. 
ing the name. 

Parfait atix Violettes, — Crush 8oz. to lOoz. of 



PARFAITS AKD SPOXGADAS. 105 

crrstallized riolets to a powder, sprinkling them with 
a little caster sugar and a good pinch of powdered 
«>rris root, and mix this all with one and a half pints 
of stiffly whipped cream, flavoured to taste with 
maraschino, and coloured to a pale violet mauve with 
Mrs. A. B. Marshall's " damson blue *' colouring 
melted in a little single cream ; stir some whole 
candied violets through it, mould, and freeze. 

Parfnit aux Pistaches. — Whip a pint of cream 
very stiffly, sweetening it with 2oz. or 3oz. of caster 
sugar, flavouring it with a teaspoonful of orange 
flower water and a few drops of almond essence, and 
colouring it to a very delicate pistachio green with 
vegetable colouring, stir quickly into it 3oz. or 4oz. 
of shelled and blanched pistachios, not too finely 
shredded; mould and freeze as before for two to 
three hours. 

Parfait aux Pruneaux. — Put into a pan a pound 
of prunes, 2oz. of caster sugar, the yellow part of a 
lemon rind, and just enough liquid (half claret, half 
water) to cover it all. As soon as the fruit is 
sufficiently tender strain off any liquid there may be 
(the most should be absorbed), stone the prunes and 
rub them all through a sieve ; crack and blanch the 
kernels and place them with the prune puree ; have 
ready a pint of stiffly whipped cream, coloured with 
a few drops of carmine, and flavoured with a glass- 
ful of cherry brandy, stir the piiine puree quickly 
cind lightly into this, mould and freeze. A little 
more sugar may be needed for some tastes. 

Parfait aux Cerises Blanches. — Stalk and stone 
21b. of fine, ripe whiteheart cherries, «>,\id.^>^v5^'<iDkSsas. 



106 ICES. 

into a pan wifh the juice of a lemon, half a poiind of 
sugar, and about a gill of water (if the cherries are 
drj, as they sometimes are, use half a pint of rhubarb 
stalk juice instead of this water) ; stew till tender 
enough to pulp through a sieve. Meantime, infuse 
a good handful of the blanched kernels in a basin 
with the juice of one and a half lemons, and pound 
them. As soon as it is soft, pulp the fruit throujrh 
a sieve or tammy, add to it about a pint of su<rar 
syrup, boiling, and pour it all on to the pountle«l 
lemon juice and kernels ; mix well, and when cold 
add to it one and a half pints of thick whipped cream 
either raw or scalded, but the fonner for choice; 
mould, and freeze. Another version of this is made 
by pulping 21b. of cherries as before, through a sieve, 
raw, with the juice of a lemon and a pint of sugar 
syrup ; mix with this the kernels prepared as in the 
preceding recipe, together with a good glassful of 
kirsch, stir to it a quart of stiffly whipped cream, 
and mould and freeze. 

As a general rule, parfaits can be made by any 
recipe given for cream ice, only stirring the fruit, <fec. 
there given into the due proportion of stiffly whipped 
cream, and mould and freeze in the usual way. 

Parfait dee Anges {American). — Prepare an Italian 
meringue (see recipe) with three q^^ whites and three 
tablespoonfuls of boiling syrup, together with a 
spoonful of maraschino, rum, or any flavouring to 
taste, and add this, when cold, to a pint of stiffly 
whipped cream, and serve. This should be accom- 
panied either hj fruits frappes, a fruit maccdoine, or 
iced rum compote. Another delicious parfait for 



PARFAITS AND SPONGADAS. 107 

serving with anj kind of iced fruit is made by 
sweetening a pint of stiffly wliipped cream (whipped 
very dry) , and flavouring it with vanilla, essence of 
lemon, <S:c., moulding and freezing it. 



The spongada is another form of ice, somewhat of 
the nature of a parfait, but not frozen so hard, and 
seldom, if ever, moulded nowadays. Indeed, it is 
too light to mould properly, and, when not served 
separately in cups or glasses, is generally used as a 
centre for some other mould. In some rare cases it 
is frozen sufficiently stiff to mould, but in that case 
it is more like an ordinary moulded ice or parfait. 

The old-fashioned freezing pot is generally used in 
the preparation of this form of ice. The method of 
its making is as follows : Having prepared the 
mixture, it is strained into the charged freezer, which 
is then covered down and turned sharply and steadily 
for a few minutes till it begins to thicken ; now take 
off the cover, and give it another turn or two un- 
covered, easing the ice as it forms, with a spatula, 
from the bottom and sides of the pot ; as soon as it 
thickens stop turning, and with the spatula work it 
well up from the bottom, till the cream is quite soft 
and light and fully double its original bulk, when 
you add a little flavouring and sweetening syrup, if 
necessary, and serve at once, either in glasses, or 
with a moulded ice, as preferred. The distinctive 
mark of this kind of ice is its frothy lightness, 
whence comes its name, and also the appellation of 
8j)umante, or frothing, giveu\Ai\^\\i\Va\N,^\^'stfe'>i^-

is mostly served. Needless to say, it is susceptible 
of almost endless variety, according to the use to 
which it is to be put. It is particularly delicious if 
shred almonds are added to it lightly, especially 
when used in conjunction with a cream or water ice 
set in a square or oval border mould. It is 
occasionally used as a filling for bombes or melon 
shapes. 

Spongada alia Bomana, — Dissolve 6oz. of fine 
vanilla chocolate and put it into a basin with a pint 
of good sugar syrup, the whites of six eggs (hghtly 
broken up, but not beaten, with a fork), and a 
tablespoonful each of vanilla and cinnamon su^^ars ; 
mix these all well together, then strain the whole 
through a sieve into the freezing pot, and work it as 
described above till it has increased to nearly twice 
the original bulk, when you dish it and stand it in 
the ice cave for two or three hours till wanted. 

Spongada alia Toledo, — Pound 8oz. of sweet and 
2oz. of bitter almonds with half a pint of water, and 
wring it through a tammy to express all the juice 
possible ; there should be half a pint of this (known 
in kitchen parlance as " milk of almonds "), then mix 
this milk with a pint of strong sugar syrup, the 
whites of six eggs, and a wineglassful of Hrsch ; 
strain it into the freezing pot, and work as in the 
preceding recipe, to twice its original bulk, when yon 
add to it 6oz. of roughly chopped burnt almonds and 
half a pint of whipped cream, and finish freezing as 
before. Another way is to make a puree of the same 
quantity of almonds by pounding them when 
blanched, with about a gill of water, and rubbing 



PARFAITS AND SPONGADAS. 109 

this all throTigh a sieve or tammy ; you now mix this 
with the egg whites and the syrup as before, flavour- 
ing it with a good tablespoonful of orange flower 
water, and colouring it to a pretty pistachio green 
with vegetable colouring ; finish as in the preceding 
recipe, adding to it some blanched and chopped 
pistachios. These make a delicious centre for any 
sort of ice ; for instance, fill a strawberry water^ 
ice-lined plain or egg-shaped moidd with the 
spongada alia Toledo, close it up and freeze for three 
hours or so; or make the spongada by the second 
almond recipe, using blanched pistachios instead of 
the sweet almonds ; line a melon or any nice shaped 
mould an inch thick with cherry or raspberry water 
ice, and fill up with the green spongada, and finish as> 
before. 

Coffee Spongada, — Have ready half a pint of black 
Mocha coffee, in which you have dissolved 4oz. to 8oz. 
of sugar (this is a matter of taste), and when cold 
stir into it a gill of unwhipped egg whites and a 
quart of stiffly whipped cream, run it through a sieve 
into the freezer, and proceed as directed above, 
adding just before serving a little more sugar syrup 
and a glassful of cognac, and finish off. 

Apricot Spongada, — Peel and stone sufficient 
apricots to produce, when sieved, one and a quarter 
Joints of pulp, add to it the whites of six unwhipped 
eggs, and one and a quarter pints of sugar syrup,, 
boiled to 38 degrees, strain it all into the freezing 
pot, and add just at the last a good liqueur- 
f ul of noveau and sugar syrup, or simply use n 
svrup. Finish off in the u&ual. "WBIJ. 



110 ICES. 

Any very finely sieved fruit pulp can be used in this 
way. 

Maraschino Spongada. — Dissolve lOoz. of sugar in 
a quart of whipped cream, and when quite melted 
stir to it the whites of enough eggs to fill a gill, and 
half a pint of maraschino ; strain into the freezer and 
proceed as before, adding a little more maraschino 
at the last. Any liqueur can be used in this way ; 
cura9oa, for instance, is very good thus, but the cream 
shoidd be faintly tinted with saffron or apricot yellow. 

Strawberry Spongada, — Stalk a quart of straw- 
berries, and sprinkle them well with 3oz. or 4oz. of 
caster sugar, then crush them through a fine sieve. 
Have ready a syrup made by boiling together 4»oz. of 
loaf sugar and half a pint of water for twenty 
minutes, and beat this into the strawberry pulp for 
five minutes, working it over ice ; then stir in 
quickly and hghtly the frothed whites of four eggs 
and a pint of stiffly whipped cream, and freeze in the 
usual way. This is not, strictly speaking, a 
spongada, though it goes by that name. 

As a matter of fact, a clever cook can prepare 
these frothy ices with any flavourings or purees to 
taste, but they are not altogether easy to make 
successfully, and take too much time and trouble for 
the average cook ; so it is unnecessary to multiply 
recipes for spongadas in this book, which is primarily 
intended for the average household, and not for one 
which can afford to keep a first-rate chef with many 
assistants ; while, if the cook likes, and can succeed in 
these ices, the above hints will be sufficient to enable 
her to vary their nature indefinitely. 



CHAPTER IX. 

CHAKLOTTES AND GATEAUX GLACES, &c. 

A VERY pretty way of serving ices much adopted 
nowadays is the charlotte glaces — i.e., an outer 
casing is made of various kinds of cake, and is then 
filled with any ice to taste, either piled in rockily or 
moulded to fit. The simplest plan is to line a plain 
charlotte mould with a strip of oiled paper, then 
press all round it sponge fingers trimmed to fit, 
making these adhere by the use of white of egg, 
royal icing, or boiled sugar ; then let them stand till 
quite dry, turn out, and fill with any ice to taste, 
standinsT them for a little in the ice cave if necessarv. 
Or ice- wafers, flat or rolled, can be used in the same 
wr y ; or strips of Florence or G^noise paste may be 
cut into a strip to fit the mould, and made to adhere, 
and filled, as before. Any of these ways can be used 
with plain ice put in rockily, but perhaps the 
prettiest effect is obtained if the casing is made by 
fixing the cake, nougat, or whatever is used, round 
the outside of the mould, the ice itself being after- 
guards frozen in the mould on which the casing was 
originally shaped; then the ice is turned out, the 
case delicately slipped over it, the to^ ^a^rttis^jkS^^^r^isScL

a macedoine of marinaded or iced fruit, and served 
at once. In short, it can be varied to any extent. 

A form of this charlotte is to be seen in the Chan- 
tilly baskets, made by dipping little macaroons, oi 
ratafies in boiling sugar, and building them up roimd 
the in or out side of any mould, and letting them 
stand till dry and firm, when they are turned out and 
used with a filling of any ice to taste. Iced fools arc 
particularly nice served in this way, the top being 
piled up with frozen, sweetened, and flavoured 
whipped cream. 

To save themselves the trouble of preparing these 
cases — which require considerable neatness of hand 
and practice to make them perfect — cooks have taken 
to hollowing out whole cakes, decorating the case 
left with Viennese and other icing, and then filling 
ap the centre with any ice to taste. These are not 
at all difficult to make, and have an extremely pretty 
effect ; and, as the portion cut out can be utilised as 
cake crumbs for many puddings, trifles, &c., there is 
no waste about them. 

Nougat case for Charlotte. — Prepare three-quarters 
of a pound of nougat (see recipe), and turn it out on 
an oiled slab or board ; roU it out quickly, cut it in 
strips about one and a half inches wide, and as long 
as the depth of the moidd ; set these aside till cold, 
then build them up round a well-oiled charlotte 
mould, using boiled sugar to fix them. Put them 
aside till perfectly set and hard, then garnish to taste 
with icing, using a forcing bag and a small rose pipe 
for the purpose. A few rounds or half circles can 
also be cut from the nougat ^aste, aimilarlv

decorated, and used to garnish the ice when piled 
into the mould. A few comets made of the stime 
jxiste, and filled with anv of the ice left over from 
fillinfi: the mould, make a daintv finish. Thev are 
verv easily made ; roll out the nougat paste as before, 
stamp it out in circles two and a half inches in 
diameter, and wrap these at once round lightly oiled 
cornet tins (mind these are oiled both out^de and in)» 
pressing the edges well together to keep them fixed, 
then draw out the paste from the tin, slip it inside, 
and put another tin inside to keep the nougat 
pressed in shape, and proceed in this way till you 
have as many cornets as you want. When quite 
crisp and dry lift them out and store then in air- 
tight tins and keep in a dry place till wanted. 

Cornet Paste is also very nice for this purpose: 
Mix to a paste 4oz. finely minced almonds, 2oz. fine 
sifted flour, 2oz. caster sugar, a large whole egg, a 
pinch of salt, and a tablespoonful of orange flower 
water. Have ready some baking tins which have lH?en 
well heated in the oven, then carefully rubbed all over 
with white wax, and allowed to cool ; spread the paste 
over these very evenly to about the thickness of a 
tenth of an inch, and bake for three or four minutes ; 
then stamp out very quickly, and use like the nougat. 

Florence Paste is another material for cases. 
Blanch and chop finely half a pound of almonds, and 
put them into a pan with half a pound of caster 
sugar, half a gill of trandy or liqueur, the strained 
juice of a good lemon, and a saltspoonful of carmine ; 
stir these altogether over the fire, letting the^n <i.<y5?«w

does not discolour ; line the mould with this while 
the mixture is hot, pressing it well into the shape of 
the mould, and leave it untouched until the paste is 
cold and drv. 

*r 

Genoise Paste, again, is often used as a ease for 
ices, &c. For it beat half a pound of fresh butter to 
a cream, with the finely grated rind of a lemon, and 
half a pound of caster sugar, beating it well for ten 
minutes after the sugar has all been worked in ; then 
add to it alternately four or five eggs, and half a 
pound of fine sifted flour, mixing in first an egg and 
then about a good tablespoonful of flour till it is all 
used ; lastly, dust in one-eighth of an ounce of 
baking powder, put it into a shallow, buttered baking 
tin, bake about half an hour, then cut it into the 
shape desired, and use. 

Ghantilly Gases are said to take their name from 
the castle belonging to the great Prince Henri of 
Conde, a noted gastronome, who gave his name to 
many dishes to which the name of Cond^ has been 
applied ; his wife, Charlotte de Medici, is also said to 
have given her name to the sweet of that name. 
According to old notions, the charlottes described 
above would have been described as Caissee a la 
Ghantilly. These cases or baskets having been 
originally filled with whipped cream, the name has 
also remained as a designation for frothed cream, and 
the case has been ignored, as if it took its name from 
the cream, instead of the fact being exactly the 
reverse. For these cases, almond paste rolled out very 
thinly was used, being pressed into the moidd whilst 
still soft, and then set in tk^ o^otl ot IdlqI cl<;^«i^t till 



CHARLOTTES, GATEAUX GLACES, &c. 115 

dry and firm. But the commonest form nowadays is 
made by dipping little macaroons or ratafies into 
sugar boiled to the crack, and with these lining any 
pretty and convenient- moidd, arranging the cakes in 
rows, and leaving them till set, when they can be 
filled with ice, spongada, &c. 

From the above directions any good cook t an pre- 
pare charlottes from all kinds of material, icing and 
garnishing them in any way that sidts her fancy. 
At the same time, an excellent effect, at considerably 
less expense of time and trouble, can be produced by 
using the hollowed-out cakes as receptacles for ice of 
all kinds. The following recipes will give an idea of 
the various methods of using them : 

Gateau Chocolat ct la Praline. — Slice a chocolate 
cake horizontally, and stamp out the centre of each 
circle (save the bottom one) with a plain round 
cutter ; have ready some royal icing, very thickly 
mixed with shred and burnt almonds, and spread 
all these rings, save the top one, with this mixture ; 
then build the cake back into shape, and let it stand 
till firm, when it is iced all over with chocolate glace ; 
garnish this round the top before it is quite set with a 
wreath of angelica leaves and dried cherries, and when 
this is set fill up the centre with praline cream ice. 

Au Bhum, — Stamp out most of the 

centre of a chocolate cake, leaving about three- 
quarters of an inch untouched at the bottom, ice the 
cake as in the previous recipe, gamishing it how- 
ever, with angelica leaves and crystallized apricots, 
and, when this is set, fill it up very high with apricot 
sorbet, rather strongly flavoured m^ Tvmi. 

I 2 



116 ICES. 

Gateau a la Rose, an cafe, — Slice a round rose cake 
horizontally into four slices, and divide each of these 
into four; spread each thickly with either clotted 
or very thickly whipped cream strongly flavoured 
with maraschino and rose water, and, after cutting 
off the point of each of them, build up the cake 
again, alternating the pieces so that the centre of the 
higher layer comes over the join of the lower one, and 
so on till the cake is back into shape ; arrange a 
wreath of crystallized rose leaves round the top, and 
fill up with white coffee ice flavoured with mara- 
schino. A very pretty variante of this is to use two 
cakes, say a rose cake and a white sponge, building 
up these differently coloured layers as before, and fill 
up with an angel cream ice, into which you have 
mixed all kinds of crystallized flowers. This is called 
Gateau Mille-fleurs, 

Another pretty cake is Mrs. A. B. MarshiaJl's 
Gateau Trouville. For this, choose a melon-shaped 
sponge cake, slice off the b">ttom about half an inch 
thick, and scoop out all the inside, leaving a shell 
about three quarters to an inch thick, then fill this 
up with any rich fruit compote, fruit fool, &c., you 
choose ; after this has been iced as cold as it can b© 
without being actually frozen, press the bottom back 
into place, and ice the whole cake over with maras- 
chino glace, garnishing this as it sets, as you please, 
to suit the filling ; have ready a border mould of ice 
to fit the cake, of any water (or cream, if liked) ice 
to suit, dish this, slip the cake on to it, and serve at 
once. Evidently the fillings and the stand of this 
cake can be varied to any extent. 



CHARLOTTES, GATEAUX GLACES, &o. 117 

ijHiieau de Cemeaux a la Parisienne. — Prepare a 
walnut cake precisely as in the recipe for chocolate 
cake with praline cream, only using a green glace 
strongly flavoured with brandy or liqueur as you 
please, garnish with walnuts carefully shelled, and 
dipped in sugar boiled to the crack, and fill up with 
nut cream ice made with walnuts. 

Gateau Genoise a la Glace. — First cut out in stiff 
cardboard or tin a six-sided (hexagonal) shape ; then 
prepare some rich genoise paste and spread this out 
on baking sheets (previously buttered, and dusted 
with equal parts of flour and sugar) about a quarter 
of an inch thick, and bake in a moderate oven. When 
ready, cut out, with the help of the cardboard shape, 
twelve hexagonal pieces ; stamp the centre out of 
all but one of them, and put these together in 
threes, place a clean plate or tin over them, weight 
them, and leave them till quite cold. Now spread 
each slice with apricot jam, previously sieved and 
moistened with a little rum or noyeau, and build the 
cake up again, being careful to make the comers fit, 
trim it neatly, and pour over it all a thin puree of 
the rum- flavoured apricot jam, and let it stand till 
wanted ; fill up with a good orange or other sorbet 
to your mind and serve. 

Like the charlottes, and, indeed, most other 
dainties, these cakes admit of endless variety, and 
once a cook has grasped the idea of their composition, 
she will find it easy enough to produce changes. 



The only form of ice left unnoticed in the sweet 
way is the iced fruit fooL Thia \a iw '^er^ ^"siXs^Xai^tf^

form of iced sweet, and, being quite free from any 
alcoholic mixture, answers admirably for tennis teas 
and other gatherings for the enjoyment of young 
people. Furthermore, there is little or no difficulty 
in their manufacture. 

Iced Gooseberry Fool, — Stew very slowly a quart 
of green gooseberries, after topping and tailing them, 
with half a pound of sugar, three or four finely pared 
strips of lemon rind, and just enough water to keep 
them from burning ; when tender mib them carefully 
through a fine sieve, adding a very few drops of 
vegetable green to bring up the colour, then add to 
it a wineglassful of maraschino liqueur syrup, a 
squeeze of lemon juice, and half a pint of stiflBv 
whipped cream ; freeze either in the freezer or in a 
tin pail tightly covered and buried in salt and ice. 
This last method takes longer to freeze, and the fool 
must be stirred up from the bottom and sides now 
and again in the course of freezing to make it set 
evenly and smoothly. Serve in a glass or ice bowl 
or tray, the latter, of course, if available, being the 
prettiest. 

Plums, apricots, peaches, &c., can all be made into 
fool by this recipe, a few of the kernels being 
used with them, and noyeau liqueur sjrup instead of 
maraschino. 

Currant Fool, — Beat the yolks of two eggs with 
loz. or 2oz. of sugar till light, and the whites of four 
eggs to a stiff froth ; have ready half a pint of juice 
obtained as for currant jelly, sweeten this lightly, 
then add it to the eggs, and a full gill of thick cream, 
and stir this all over the fire tUl it thickens to a rich 



CHARLOTTES, GATEAUX GLACES, &c. 119 

custard, but without boiling, or it will curdle ; colour 
with a few drops of carmine, freeze as before, and 
serve in the same way. 

Orange Fool. — Mix together the strained juice of 
three good oranges, the well-beaten yolks of three 
eggs, half a pint of single cream or new milk, 2oz. 
of sugar, and a grate of cinnamon if liked, and stir 
this all over a slow fire till it thickens nicely, then lift 
it off the fire and keep it stirred till it is cold, when 
it can be iced and served as before. 

Any fruit can be made into fool by one or other 
of these recipes, and have the further advantage that, 
if no freezer is at hand, they will be very nice if 
served plainly with wafers or any nice little cakes, 
only, of course, they should be stood on ice till as 
cold as it is possible to get them. 

As many housekeepers are unaware how easy it is 
to preserve fruit pulp (when fruit is cheap), that will 
last and enable one to have fresh fruit ices, creams. 
fools, and even tarts all the year round, the following 
is given : — 

Fruit Puree for Keeping, — Choose fine, ripe, and 
perfectly sound fruit (the soundness of the fruit 
used is all important), and pulp this through a clean, 
freshly scalded, but perfectly dry, tammy or hair 
sieve ; pack this pulp, just as it stands and with no 
sugar, into clean, dry, and wide-mouthed bottles, 
cork these down tightly with new corks, and then tie 
them down closely with moist bladder ; now stand 
these bottles in a kettle three- parts full of coldi er, 
or up to the shoulder of the bottles (putti 
hay between the bottles to keep the t

when the water begins to boil) ; bring this gently to 
the boil, and keep it boiling steadily for twenty 
minutes ; now lift the pan off the fire (or turn off the 
gas, for a gas ring is far the most convenient for this), 
and let the kettle stand till the water is perfectly 
cold, without in any way touching the bottles till 
every particle of heat is gone out of the water ; then 
lift them out, wipe them dry, and store in a cool, 
dry place. Strawberries preserved in this way are 
particularly delicious, with all the flavour of the 
fresh fruit. But remember, once a bottle is opened 
it must be used up, as it does not keep well after 
opening. 



CHAPTER X. 

SAVOUEY ICES. 

From the cold dishes, brought into fashion the last \ 

few years, to iced savouries is little more than a step, 
and a step, moreover, soon taken. Many forms of 
" creams " lend themselves wonderfully well to 
freezing, their delicate flavour gaining an additional 
piquancy from their temperature. Other forms of 
savoury ice take the shape of frozen sauces, served 
in solid cubes or fingers, often as an accompaniment 
to very hot dishes such as grills, broils, &c. A few 
specimens of these will be given below. With regard 
to savoury iced entrees of fi.sh, flesh, and fowl, it must 
be admitted that these partake more of the nature of 
a Moscovite than of the special ices whose names 
they assume, as a modicum of best leaf gelatine is in 
almost every case a necessary; still, they offer a 
welcome variety from the conventional entrees at 
dinner parties. 

Iced Vegetahle Creams, — Cook the vegetables very 
gently till tender enough to pulp through a fine 
sieve, in either milk, white, or brown stock, according 
to the vegetables used; using, for instance, milk, 
or white stock, for peas, c>ic'uiny>&x^)

, and brown stock for tomatoes, &c« 
\)ottot3ftS» ed, season the puree to taste, adding to 
-^heti "bf vegetable pur^e, a gill of good sauce 
eacld iemande, bechamel, or veloute for the white 
(\\\A Espagnole, or curry for the dark ones), and 
QT over a gill of stiff aspic jelly ; when this is all 
stir into it quickly a couple of tablespoonfuls 
shipped cream, and, if necessary, a few drops of 
^getable colouring. Then mould and put aside to 
Aet. Of course, these creams can be served in a 
variety of ways, and garnished to taste. One of the 
most usual is to prepare two or three purees of con- 
trasting colours, and place these in layers in a 
Neapolitan ice mould, which is then put into the ice 
cave for one and a half to two hours (or bury the 
mould in ice and salt for about the same time) ; then 
remove the lid from the mould, and run a little, just 
liquid, aspic jelly, meat jelly, or tomato aspic (if 
the dish is to be uncompromisingly vegetarian) over 
the whole, and replace the covered mould in the cave 
till the jelly is firmly set. Then dip the underside 
in cold water, and slip the cream out, leaving the 
jelly uppermost. The iced vegetables can then be 
served as a whole, or sliced down to show the 
different colours, like Neapolitan ices. Otherwise 
they can be served in little shapes, as, for instance, 
in fonds d*artichaut8 cb la creme de tomates, glaces. 
For this, turn out some nicely shaped, rather small 
artichoke bottoms (either fresh-cooked or canned), 
and set them on ice or in the ice cave; prepare a 
tomato cream ; rub sufficient ripe red tomatoes 
thi'ough sb sieve to produce one a id a, kali ^ills of puree,

stir into this a good spoonful of niayoi^aise a very 
few drops of carmine if necessary, and i full cri]l of 
stiffly whipped cream, add a little tarragon r^jj^^ . 
the puree, if liked, set the whole in some litt^ bomb© 
moulds, and leaye these in the ice caye for a. j^our 
Then turn out and dish each little moidd on s^^ ^ 
the artichoke bottoms, and serye garnished ^fi^ 
chopped aspic jelly. The Neapolitan ices can a^ 
be made into a pretty dish by turning out the brie 
of iced yegetable, and then with a plain round cuttei^ 
stamp out the block into little cylinders about an \ 
inch and a half in diameter, and serye garnished with 
tomato salad, which has been stood in the caye, or on 
ice, till perfectly cold. Almost any yegetable can be 
made into a puree for icing according to the 
directions giyen aboye for tomato cream. A yery 
pretty vegetable Neapolitan ice may be made with a 
layer of artichoke pur^e (kept as white as possible), 
a layer of cucumber or pea pur^e (coloured a Taint 
delicate green), and a layer of tomato puree, or a 
layer of curried pur^e may be used instead of the 
tomato. For this, mince down two large peeled 
onions, and fry them to a delicate golden brown 
with loz. of butter, a grain of salt, and a pinch each 
of powdered bay leaf and parsley; when nicely 
coloured add to it a saltspoonful of curry powder, a 
dust of coralline pepper, the strained juice of a lemon, 
two large fresh and minced mushrooms, a teaspoon- 
ful of chutney, half a coffeespoonful of curry paste, 
and half a pint of water, and cook it altogether till 
tender, dissolving in it two or three sheets of best 
leaf gelatine J then rub it a\\ Wixqxjl^ ^ 'i\e^^ ^j^ssSi.

strong white stock (preferably chicken stock), then 
stir into this the minced contents of a tin of fonds 
d*artichauts, and rub it all through a sieve ; stir into 
this puree a large tablespoonful of very creamy 
velout^ or bechamel, and add to this as it begins to 
set one and half good tablespoonfuls of stiffly 
whipped cream. Pour this cream into small bombe 
moulds and set them in the ice cave for an hour. 
Prepare some tomato aspic (mix together a gill of 
aspic jelly, not quite a gill of tomato pur^e, and a 
spoonful of whipped cream), and run it into a 
shallow tin, in half inch layers, and when -this is set 
stamp it out in two-inch rounds ; prepare some 
green mayonnaise aspic (a gill of aspic to nearly a 
gill of mayonnaise, coloured by the addition of a few 
drops of colouring, and a little pur^ of tarragon,

mackerel 'roes, &c., and stir it into some rich tartare 
sauce, strongly flavoured with curry powder j set it 
in the ice cave in a basin, for one and a half hours.

Scraps of chicken, and ham or tongue, sweetbread, 
brains, &c., can all be used up in this way. 

Oeufa de Vanneaux a VIrlandaise. — Make an 
Irlandaise sauce by mixing together a gill each of 
rich mayonnaise, and stiffly whipped cream, a table- 
epoonful of tarragon vinegar, a dash each of caster 
sugar and coralline pepper, with just enough vege- 
table green to bring it to a pale soft green ; into this 
stir as many separately cooked and finely shred 
vegetables (such as young carrots, turnips, i»eas, 
cucumber, &c.) as will make up a gill, and with this 
mixture fiill up some Monaco moulds (small truncated 
cones hollowed out at the top) and put them in the 
ice cave to set for an hour. Turn out, place a 
plover's egg in each, garnish with watercress 
seasoned with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper, and 
serve. 

Mousse de Volatile Glacee. — Toss three or foui- 
chicken livers in a little butter and sherry till cooked, 
and when cold pound them with half a pound of finely 
mixed chicken, two good tablespoonf uls of very rich 
creamy veloute, and a seasoning of salt, white and 
coralline peppers ; rub this all through a sieve, work 
into it half a pint of whipped cream, arid a good 
fipoonfid each of tiny cubes of truffle and f oie gras ; 
pack it all in a plain charlotte mould, and freeze for 
one and a half to two hours in the charged ice cave. 

This mixture can also be frozen in tiny papered 
€0uffl<3 cases, and served garnished with coralline 
pepper, minced parsley, and truffle. 

A particularly nice form of this cream is made 
with any game, using EspagnoVft ox ^Sac^^^m ^asa^^j^

instead of veloute, and making the aspic with clear 
game stock instead of water. Hare, for instalicf:, 
made thus, frozen in ballette moulds, and served on 
a bed of chopped aspic with iced tomato puree, 
is much to be recommended. 

Creme au foie gras glacee. — Season a pint of thi^k 
cream with a pinch of coralline y>epf^r and a litth.' 
salt ; add haK a pint of just liquid aspic, and fre<;ze iu 
the freezer till just setting. Line a plain mould 
about l^in. thick with this ice, lay into it the 
contents of a jar of pate de foie fjraa trufft, carefully 
freed from any grease, fill up with more of the f roz^iu 
cream, and leave it in the cave for an hour or so. 

Souffle glace au foie gras. — S^^^ason a pint of very 
stiffly whipped cream with coralline pej>fjer and salt, 
and mix into it lightly with a silver fork the contents 
of a jar of foie gras truffe broken up small ; freeze, 
and when about three parts frozen stir in a gill of 
freshly whipped cream, pack in a papered souffle 
mould, and freeze in the ca,ve for an hour or more. 
Remove the outer paper carefully and serve, sprinkled 
with coralline pepper and minced truffle and parsley. 
This is fearfully rich, but very delicious. Crab, 
lobster, salmon, <fcc. can all be served in this way, 
but it is better then to mix the fish with a gill of 
rich mayonnaise (either plain or tomato) to three- 
quarters of a pint of whipped cream in the first 
instance. 

Souffle de perdrix glacee, — Dissolve |^oz. best leaf 
gelatine and a teaspoonful of glaze in half a pint of

can be substituted for this ; or, if game is scarce, 
pick all the available flesh from some carcases of 
roast game, make a very strongly flavoured stock 
with the bones, and add sufficient cold minced 
chicken or rabbit to bring it to the requisite 
quantity) ; when all these have been very quickly 
stirred together, pour it all into a papered souffle 
case, to within ^^in. of the top of the band, and set it 
in the charged cave for thirty to forty minutes ; then 
lift it out of the ice cave, and run over it a layer of 
very strong game aspic, and return it to the cave for 
twenty to twenty-five minutes till firmly set ; remove 
the paper, and serve with a rose of stiffly whipped 
cream mixed with minced parsley, truffle, and 
coralline pepper on the top. This can be frozen in 
small paper cases (of couise, papered as usual), and 
any game can be used for it. Cold roast grouse 
with the mushroom puree, and the cream mixed with 
tiny dice of f oie gras is specially delicious in this way. 
Tomates a la Creme au Celeri. — Peel some small, 
well-shaped and coloured tomatoes by dipping them 
for a moment in boiling water and then removing 
the skin ; scoop out the seeds and the centre, and set 
them in the ice cave till perfectly cold and firm ; 
have ready some nice celery, cut into tiny julienne

freeze a pint of stiffly whip|)ed cream, and when half 
frozen stir into it the celery, cheese, and walnut«, 
with a seasoning of cayenne and a vtrry little Malt, 
finish freezing, and serve piled up in the toijtitto6ii. 
Artichoke bottoms can be ui*ed innt^^ad of tomatoe«, 
and the filling can also be vari#.vl to taute. 

Iced Vegetable Maced&ine. — Turn out the contents 
of a tin of bottle of vegetable mac<:doine and drain 
it well (or take a pint of any freshly cooked but c^dd 
vegetables of as many different kindM ati you can), 
have ready one and a half pints of very rich curry 
sauce, in which vou have dissolved four or five sheettf 
of best leaf gelatine, stir the vegetaijles into this as 
it is setting, mould (a tall, straight cylinder mould is 
best), and freeze in a cave for three-quarters to one 
hour. Turn out, and serve either with plainly boiled 
rice or with a garnish of sliced lobster garnished 
with mayonnaise aspic 

Iced Anchovy Cream. — Wash and bone six an- 
chovies, and pound them with the hard-boiled yolk 
of an Q^^, a tablespoonf ul of oil, a dust of cayenne, 
and just as few drops of carmime as will bring it all 
to a pretty pink. When this is all perfectly smooth, 
mix with it a gill of only just liquid aspic, tammy, 
and stir it to one and a half gills of stiffly whipped 
cream ; mould in little dariole moulds, and set them in 
a cave for half an hour, then turn out, and serve with 
a rose of cayenne-flavoured cream or good caviare on 
each little mould. 

Chuese Creams^ Iced. — Mix lightly and quickly 
together three tablespoonfuls of freshly grated Par- 
mesan sheese, two oi grated CjTwY^x'i^ ^ ^^^«^ ^"C

cayenne, a full gill of aspic jelly, and half a pint of 
stif&y whipped cream, mould, and freeze in a cave 
for an hour. These can also be served in little 
papered souffle cases. 

Ham Creams y Iced. — Into half a pint of stiffly 
whipped cream stir a gill of just liquid aspic, with 
4oz. to 6oz. of freshly grated ham, colour it to a 
delicate pink with a drop or two of carmine, whisk 
it all well together till light, fill some Monaco bombs 
with the mixture, and set them in the ice cave till 
thoroughly frozen, then turn out and serve with a 
plover's or a pigeon's e^^ on each. 

All rich sauces in which mayonnaise or whipped 
cream plays an important part can be frozen by 
putting them when mixed into a Neapolitan ice 
moidd and freezing them for an hour or so till stiff, 
when they can be turned out and served sliced or 
in fingers. Savoury Neapolitan creams can be 
made by moulding together two of these sauces, say, 
for instance, a very rich brown chauf roix sauce and 
a rich sauce Eaifort a TAlceste, freezing them and 
serving as above. Obviously, any contrasting yet 
harmonious sauces can be served in this way. 



CHAPTER XI. 

ICED DRINKS. 

With the season for ices comes also the soitsou I'm 
iced drinks, and though these are too miuuu'ouH to 
be exhaustively treated in so small a book as ihiri, a 
few may be given, if only as samples. 

Iced Coffee, — Have ready a well-lieatod eal'etien^ 
standing in a pan of boiling water, or in tlio l>aiii- 
marie, put into the percolator four large tablt»H|joou- 
fuls of freshly ground and roasted Mocha coil'eo, and 
to this pour gradually a pint of freshly and abso- 
lutely boiling water, let it stand after this for ten 
minutes in the bain-marie at the side of the stovt*, 
then to each pint of coffee allow 2oz. or 8oz. of 
caster sugar (this must to some extent depend on 
taste), and haK a pint of cream, or half cream and 
half new milk, slightly warmed, and let it stand till 
cold, then freeze it in the freezer till only just liquid 
enough to pour from the jug. Stand it on the ice 
till wan'ed. 

Sweeten a quart of strong, freshly made 

coffee to taste, add 10 it a pint of single cream or 
new milk, and freeze till fairly thick, then stir into it 
half a pint of cream, whipped till stiff, and keei^ it ij\ 
2 cold place on ice. 



132 ICES. 

Iced Coffee — Into a quart of strong, clear coffee put 
4oz. sifted sugar and a wineglassful of brandy (or 
maraschino). Leave this well banked up in ice and 
salt till wanted, and when about to serve, put in a 
lump of ice, and serve as it is or with an accompani- 
ment of whipped and iced cream. 

It must be borne in mind that the coffee must be 
first-rate in quality, freshly roasted and ground, be 
made with freshly boiled water, and be very clear. 
Coffee for icing purposes should always be very 
strong, as the icing reduces the flavour. 

Iced Tea. — Make a quart of tea in the usual way, 
being careful to have the water with which it is made 
absolutely boiling, and sweeten to taste. Let it 
stand till cold, then stir into it haK a pint of single 
cream and ice. 

{Russian) — Procure some first-rate 

Russian tea (the Caravan tea is best for this), and 
make a quart of it, fairly strong, in the usual way, 
allow it to stand only for five minutes at the outside 
(three minutes are often considered sufficient), then 
pour it off into a bowl and sweeten to taste ; ice this 
well, then stir into it two lemons very thinly sliced, 
and leave it on ice or in the cave till wanted ; when 
serving give a slice of lemon and a tiny lump of ice 
in each cup. 

{a la Sir A. ClarJc). — Make a quart of 

tea in the usual way, only use boiling milk instead of 
water, sweeten lightly, and let it stand till cold, then 
pour it off and freeze. Serve icy cold, with, or with- 
out, a teaspoonful of whipped and frozen cream in 

each cup. 



ICED DBINK6. 133 

Iced Cocoa. — Stir four good tablespoonfuk of 
reallj first-rate oocoa (sucli a£ Cadbuij'B, Van 
Houten's, Rowntree's, <tc.) till Biaootk, with a gill 
of cold TTiillr, then pour to it a quart of boiling milk* 
let it just boil up again, then allow it to ccx>l, and 
freeze. A full teaspoonful of sweetened, whipped, or 
thick and frozen cream, flaroured with a drop or two 
of vanilla should be handed with this. 

For cups it will be found a great improvement if 
the mixing jug or bowl be first imbedded in a large 
basin filled frith ice and salt in the usual wav, and 
then, if it has to stand, a double newspa[>er can lie 
firmly twisted over it, in which way it will keep very 
fairly well, though many cups, especiaUy those made 
with claret, are better if only made as they are 
wanted. 

Lemon Squash, — Halve eight good lemons, or ten 
nice fresh limes, and strain off their juice, sweetening 
this with a tablespoonf ul of caster sugar to each lemon 
or lime (a little of this sugar may be used as loaf 
sugar, on which the yellow part of the rind of two or 
three of the lemons should be rubbed off) ; put this 
into a delicately clean pan, let it all simmer gently 
in a pint of water till the sugar is perfectly dissolved, 
then let it cool a little ; now beat up the white and 
shell of an eggy stir it into the mixture, and continue 
stirring till it boils up ; allow it to boil for a lumute 
or two, then strain it very gently through a jolly hag. 
When cold add joz. of citric acid, bottle, and cork 
down closely. When required for use, put a wine- 
glassful of this mixture into a soda water tumbler^ 
and pour on to it a bottle oi \f?^W-\vi.vi^ ^^v^^^^* >^'?i^K^^

and serve with a thin slice of lemon in the glass. 
This is particularly good if the tumbler has been 
stood in ice before using, till quite frozen. For men, 
a few drops of Angostura bitters may be put into 
the glass first, and well shaken round the glass» the 
lemon syrup being then added, and lastly the iced 
soda water. Serve with a straw. 

Lemonade, — ^Rub off the yellow part of the rind of 
six goo. lemons, or eight limes, on to |lb. of loaf 
sugar, and place this in a jug with ^Ib. caster sugar 
and enough abs(ilutely boiling water to cover it all ; 
cover the jug and let it all stand till cold, and the 
sugar perfectly dissolved ; now strain on to this the 
juice of the lemons, and add as much water and, if 
necessary, sugar as you think right (this depends on 
the strength you wish the lemonade to be), and bank 
up the jug in ice and salt, covering it with newspaper 
as said above. Serve icy cold, with thin slices of 
lemon floating in it. Or : peel the lemons as above 
very thinly, so as only to get the yellow part, and 
pour on to this just enough absolutely boiling water 
to cover it all ; meanwhile, prepare a pint of clear 
sugar and water syrup, strain the juice of the 
lemons into this, and add the water in which the 
peel was steeped when it is quite cold, with enough 
cold filtered water to bring it to the strength you 
desire, and ice as before, serving in the same way. 
Abroad the pips of the fruit are steei)ed with the 
peel, but this gives a rather bitter taste to those not 
used to it. If the lemons of which this is made are 
luUr I'ipe, the lemonade will be of a bright yellow 
t/nt but if the finiit is rather \\mn^e ^.ti^ ec>\i^^Q^v\^\i>\^ 



ICED DRINKS. 135 

green (especially the case with limes), the liquid will 
also be of a faint greenish shade. 

Orgeat Syrup, — Blanch lib. of sweet almonds and 
loz. of bitter ones, then mince and poimd them in a 
marble mortar to a smooth paste, moistening them 
with the juice of half a lemon ; when pounded, add 
to it a pint of barley-water, and rub it all through a 
sieve, or wring it through a tammy. Now pour a 
little of the strained liquid back on to the sediment 
that did not go through the sieve, and mix it well 
together ; add to this another pint of barley-water, 
and wring this also through the tammy, add it to the 
first lot, and to each pint of liquid allow IJlb. of 
sugar and a drachm each of orange flower water and 
of rectified spirit. Bottle, and cork closely. With 
this the Americans make orgeat lemonade thus : Rub 
the rim of a soda water glass with a piece of freshly 
cut lemon peel, then put into it half a wineglassful 
of orgeat syrup, the strained juice of half a lemon, 
and fill up with a " split " of iced soda water. Mind 
the glass itself is very cold for this. 

Milk Lemonade. — Dissolve together one pound of 
loaf sugar, a gill of lemon juice, half a pint of sherry, 
and a pint of water, and let it stand till cold. Then 
pour to it a quart of new milk, and set it in ice as 
before. Some of the lemon rind rubbed off on to 
the sugar is a great improvement to this. 

Orangeade. — This can be made precisely as in the 
recipe for lemonade ; or, well wipe four oranges and 
two lemons, and slice them without peeling ; lay 
these slices in a pan with half a pound of caster 
sugar, and pour on to them two quarts of absolutely 



136 ICES. 

boiling water, cover the pan, and leave till perfe<^tly 
cold, and ice. 

Claret Cup (/8^oyer'«) .—Peel two lemons very 
thinly, and lay the peel in a basin ; add four table- 
spoonfuls of caster sugar, the juice of four lemons, a 
few slices of cucumber (leave the peel on), pour on 
to this two bottles each of soda water and claret, 
well iced, one bottle of iced champagne, and stir up 
well. (With all due deference to so great an 
authority, this is even nicer if the yellow part of the 
lemons be rubbed off on to the sugar ; moreover, the 
directions as to making this in a bowl half buried in 
ice must be strictly observed.) 

Put into a basin two bottles of good 

claret, half a teaspoonf ul of violet syrup, and a gill 
of pale brandy ; when this is all icy cold, stir in two 
bottles of well-iced soda or potash water and a full 
gill of raspberry water ice, and serve. 

(Simple). — Put into a jug a bottle of 

claret with sufficient sugar to sweeten it, a strip 
or two of lemon peel, and a slice or so of cucumber, 
and, when icy cold, pour on to it two bottles of iced 
Boda water, and use. 

Chahlis Cup. — Rub the yellow part of a quarter of 
a lemon off on four or five lumps of sugar and put 
these in a basin with a very thin slice of lemon peel 
and a gill of boiling water ; let it all stand for half 
an hour, then add to it a bottle of chablis, a wine- 
glassful of sherry, half a pint of wat^er, and a small 
spray of lemon verbena ; mix this all well and let it 
nit embedded in ice for fully half an hour, then strain 
jt, add SL bottle of iced soda watiex, «uia.^\x^fe. 



ICED DRINKS. 137 

Tennis Cup. — Embed a large bowl in a tub of ice, 
and salt and put into it eight tables poonfula of caster 
sugar, the finely peeled rind of two and the juice of 
four lemons, two wineglassf uls of brandy, the same 
of ginger syrup, and, when the sugar is melted, pour 
to it four bottles of soda water and throw in a spray 
or two of borage and the same of lemon-set* iited 
verbena. Ice well, and serve in small glasses with a 
toddy ladle. 

Pineapple Cup. — Embed a basin or jug in icci as 
before, and put into it two slices of pineapple, with 
two teaspoonfuls of caster sugar, pour pn to this two 
bottles of good sound dinner claret, with a couple of 
lumps of ice the size of a man's fist ; when wanted 
add a full quart bottle of well-iced, sparkling 
Moselle, and serve. 

Marsala Cup, — Pour into a well-iced basin one 
bottle of Marsala, one of iced soda water, a wine- 
glassful of lemon juice, the rind of a lemon rubbed 
off on some lumps of sugar, a bunch of borage, or a 
slice or two of cucumber, and ice and sugar to taste. 
If cucumber is used for this float some strawberries 
on the top. 

Kaltesckale. — These are easily made by pulpin^^ 
any fruit to taste, and to this piu'ee put a bottle of 
light white wine (Rhenish for choice, as this is a 
German drink), add a squeeze of lemon juice, sugai 
to taste, and a garnish of any fruit similar to that o 
which the puree is made ; ice well. A liqueur-glass- 
ful of liqueur, or rather more of liqueur syrup, is a 
great addition. As to the quantity of fruit, tl\^t. 
depends a good deal on t»\ift iit\3i\\» W^v^. ^<s^ 



138 ICES. 

instance, if you use wild strawberries (quite the 
nicest kalteschale) a quart of the fruit is n-seded, 
whereas six good apricots, stewed till tender enough 
to pulp, will, with the addition of two raw ones cut 
up as garnish with the blanched kernels, be ample 
jfor the same quantity of wine. 

Floater. — To a bottle of well-iced lemonade add a 
tablespoonful of sherry, and one of noyeau, and 
drink. Variations of this are made by putting a 
tablespoonful of kirsch (liqueur or syrup), and the 
same quantity of cherry water ice at the bottom of a 
soda water tumbler, add to it a little sherry and pour 
on to it all a bottle of well-iced seltzer- water. Or 
use lemon water ice, and a liqueur-glassful of lemon- 
brandy to the iced seltzer. 

Ching-Ching. — Put into a well-iced glass a gill of 
rum, a sliced Tangerine orange, a drop each of 
essence of peppermint and essence of clove, and fill 
up with iced soda water. 

" A Sensation.*' — Put into a jug a tablespoonful of 
raspberry syrup, a good slice of pineapple, the juice 
of haK an orange, the juice of a whole lemon, a gill 
of brandy, sugar to taste, and a bottle of well-iced 
soda water. Needless to observe these last " drinks " 
are originally American, though they have been pro- 
bably Anglicised by the substitution of iced soda 
water for the shaved ice of the U.S.A. 

Iced Egg Nogg. — Beat up the yolk of a very 

fresh eggy till light, with a spoonful of caster sugar 

(the size of this spoon depends on taste), a table- 

Bpoonful of cold water, one of brandy (or rum), two 

of sherry, and a good giifl. oi \ie^ ToSik, ^\A ^m%\i

with either shaved ice, or a split of well-iced aodsL 
water. 

Ice Cream Soda. — For these popular Auiericau 
drinks a proper "shaker" is required, but for the 
untravelled Briton a very fair imitation can be made 
in this way : Into a long soda water timibler put a 
good tablespoonful of any fruit syrup to taste, and 
the same of rich vanilla cream ice (if preferred use 
plain iced cream or crenie vierge)j some splinters of 
ice, and fill up with iced soda water from a syphon 
held verv high. 



CHAPTEE XII. 

ODDS AND ENDS. 

Apricot Jam Sauce. — Melt 4oz. of apricot jam with 
two tablespoonfuls of caster sugar, and four table- 
spoonfuls of water, and boil it altogether for ten 
minutes ; sieve it, add a drop or two of carmine, a 
claret-glassful of noyeau syrup and a good liqueur- 
glassful of rum, mix it well and use. 

Any jam can be used in this way, of course varying 
the liqueur. 

Caramel. — Put into a pan 4oz. best cane sugar, 
2oz. of water and 2oz. of strained lemon juice, and 
boil till of a rich golden colour. Mind it does not 
catch or it will spoil anything with which it is used. 

Nougat. — Blanch half a pound of almonds, and 
shred them very finely lengthways ; lay them on a 
baking sheet and bake till of a pale golden brown, 
keeping them well turned and stirred, to colour them 
evenly and prevent their sticking together. Put half 
a pound of sugar in a pan with two full tablespoon- 
fuls of lemon juice and boil it together till it is of a 
bright golden colour, then mix in the ahred and baked 
almonds and let it all just boil up. keeping it stirred 
all the time ; then turn out and mould as quickly as 
possible. Remember moulds lined with nougat must 
be brushed over witli sweet oil. 



ODDS AND ENDS. 141 

Praline Powder. — Melt 4oz. of cane sugar either 
in a copper sugar boiler or a fireproof earthenware 
dish, over a very slack fire till it turns a rich deep 
brown ; then stir into it 4oz. of blanched and chopped 
almonds, and cook them till the whole is well browned 
(be careful it does not bum). Now spread this mix- 
ture on an oiled dish and leave it till cold, when you 
either pound the whole to a powder or leave a part 
out, which must be but roughly crushed, this last 
part being added to the mixture in which you stir the 
praline powder, just at the last. 

Syrup of Violets, — Free one and a half pounds of 
fresh violet flowers from their stalks and steep them 
for two days closely covered, in a pint of distilled 
soft water, then wring them to get every drop of 
juice from them, add this liquid to two pounds of 
cane sugar and boil to a syrup; when cool add 
one and a half fluid ounces of spirit, and bottle. 

(Imitation). — Infuse half a pound of 

finely powdered orris root in a quart of spirits of 
wine, then add to it a pint of water, and one and a 
haK pounds of sugar. Let it steep for a month, then 
filter off into bottles. 

Syrup of Ginger. — Mix together half a fluid ounce 
of tincture of ginger, and half a pint of good sugar 
syrup. 

Sugar to Colour. — Put a little colouring in a 
mortar and crush the sugar with this till thoroughly 
coloured. 

(To Flavour). — Crush together either 

stick cinnamon, or vanilla or other flavouring to 
taste. 



142 ICES. 

Sugar, to Boil (for Glace Fruit), — Boil half a 
pound of cane loaf sugar with a gill of water, to the 
crack, and use. 

Sugar, to Boil. — There are one or two points to be 
observed with regard to sugar boiling. First of all, 
it should be ca7ie sugar ; secondly, it must be of the 
best quality, for this does not need clarifying, a 
troublesome proceeding which modern manufacture 
renders unnecessary. Choose sugar highly crystal- 
lized, perfectly dry, and difficut to break. 

With regard to boiling bugar, there are eleven 
degrees, known respectively as : 

I. The small thread, or petit Usee; 

II. The great thread, or le grand Usee; 

III. The small pearl, or le petit perU ; 

IV. The great pearl, or le grand perle; 

V. The small spark, or le petit sovffle, or la plume \ 

VI. The great spark, or le grand souffle, or la 
grande plume ; 

VII. The ball, or le petit houlet ; 

VIII. The great ball, or le grand houlet ; 

IX. The crack, or le petit casse ; 

X. The great crack, or le grand casse; 

XI. The burnt, or caramel stage. 

The first stage of this boiling is arrived at thus : 
dissolve 21b. of best cane loaf sugar in a pint of 
water, allow it to boil for a minute after it is 
-dissolved, then lift the pan aside and remove all 
scum. Again boil up the syrup for a few minutes, 
then dip your forefinger and thumb first into cold 
w^ater, and then into the boiling syrup, and press 
your iinger and thumb \i^\i^A.y \i0^e\Xvet\ t^o^h dx^^ 



ODDS AKD ENDS. 143 

tliem apart, when a smaLL fine thread will form 
between them, snapping off however, as vou oj>en 
them, and leaving t^o tiny drops on finger and 
thumb. The next stage is reached when the thrciad 
will draw out a little longer ; the third, when on 
again dipping in the finger and thumb, tbe thread 
does not break when the finger and thumb open 
naturally ; whilst the fourth stage is attained when 
you can spread finger and thumb to the uttermost 
without the thread break! Dg. Remember, the sugar 
must be boiled a few minutes longer between each 
stage; and whatever you do, do not forget to dip 
your fingers into the cold water first, or you may 
have a very nasty bum. The fifth stage is reached 
when on re-boiling the syrup and dipping the 
skimmer into it you can, after shaking it over the pan 
and blowing through the holes, see little bubbles on 
the other side of the skimmer; whilst when, on 
blowing through the skimmer, the sugar flies off in 
feathery sparks, it has reached the feather stage. 
No. Vn. is known when, on dipping your finger and 
thumb into cold water again, and then into the 
sugar, the latter allows itself to be rolled up into a 
little ball which toughens and becomes elastic when 
cold. When it forms a larger and harder ball, it 
has come to the eighth stage. When, on again 
wetting your fingers and picking up some of the 
sugar, it breaks with a little crack, and on being 
bitten sticks to the teeth, it has come to the crack, 
which becomes in a minute or two more the great 
crack, when the suoar will be crisp and brittle, and 
will break between the teeth with a cfewa. ^t^Os.X^'"^

glass ; or if flung into cold water it will faU with a 
distinct tinkle into the basin. Lastly, it will he 
caramel when it begins to turn colour ; first a faint 
yellow, when it should be lifted from the fire and a 
little lemon juice be added, or a little water. On 
re-boiling this will darken, first to a rich golden 
brown, and then to the black, or burnt stage. 

If much sugar is boiled it is well to have a sac- 
charometer, or syrup gauge, to test the sugar, as 
this gives the precise stage without any other test, 
but for ordinary purposes the above directions suffice. 

Sugar Syrup. — It is well worth the trouble to 
keep store syrup at hand, as it is a great addition to 
almost every kind of ice, and water ices especially 
are never so nice as when made with sugar syrup 
instead of plain sugar and water. If you use the 
syrup gauge alluded to above, you will find a syrup 
that registers 34 deg. the best for making fondant 
for icing cakes, &c. ; 32 deg. should be used for 
fruits frappes, and such things ; whilst a syrup that 
only registers from 18 deg. to 20 deg. is the best 
for water ices. If, however, you have no spirit gauge 
you will find the following rough calculation very 
effective : Put into a pan two pounds of best loaf 
sugar, with a pint of cold water, and stir it over the 
fire till the sugar has dissolved. Watch it from the 
moment this happens, and the sugar begins to boil, 
and, as soon as it bubbles all over, and becomes the 
consistency of cream, it is about 18 deg. to 20 deg. ; 
when it has boiled five minutes exactly from the 
start it has reached 26 deg. ; at the end of ten 
minutes, 28 deg.; at the end of fifteen minutes, 



ODDS AND ENDS. 145 

30 deg. ; at the end of twenty-five minutes, 32 deg. ; 
at tLe end oi thirty-five minutes, it reaches 34 deg, ; 
gaining a degree with eath five minotes' boiling. 

Su'jar to Spin. — For this dissolve a pound of best 
cane loaf sugar in half a pint of water, and then 




r«, 10. 

boil it to the " crack " ; aa soon as it has reached 
tbis stage, when it looks thick and bubbled all over, 
test it by lifting a little and dropping it into cold 
water ; if it is quite brittle, and drops clear of 
whatever it is lifted with, it is ready ; if, however, it 



14J5 ICES. 

is the least soft or elastic, continue the boiling. 
When it is ready lift some of the sugar in a spoon 
and let its contents drop back into the pan till it 
forms a fine thread ; now hold a slightly oiled rolling 
pin out shoulder-high with your left hand, and move 
your spoon first right then left over the pin, keeping 
the spoon vertical (so that as you spin it the sugar 
thread will rest on the pin) till you have enough for 
your purpose. If put away in an air-tight tin, you 
can keep spun sugar for a little time. Be careful 
during your spinning not to work in a draught ; also 
remember to put some clean tins or sheets of paper 
on the floor, that the ends of the threads may not 
touch the floor. If the sugar gets too cool to spin 
properly, just melt it over the fire again. The 
illustration (Fig. 10) shows the process, which is, 
however, not so easy as it looks, but requires a good 
deal of practice. 

Meringue. — This is the name given in France to a 
mixture made by beating the whites of eggs to a stiff 
froth with a tiny pinch of salt, and a tablespoonful 
or two of caster sugar for each egg-white ; this is ysed 
sometimes by the unconscientious to increase the 
bulk of whipped cream while sweetening it, and ig 
frequently added to sorbets, as it gives lightness, 
smoothness, and substance to the ice. It is alsc 
added to water ices for the same reason, but in that 
case is better as 

Italian Mih-ingue, which is made thus: boil one 
pound of best cane loaf sugar and a pint of water to the 
ball, then pour it slowly and gently on the whites of 
B2X eggs (previously beaten to a stiff froth), and mix 



ODDS AND ENDS. U7 

it all smoothly together. It is well to remember in 
beating egg-whites for meringtie, that thej should be 
beaten till quite stiff and standing up in points, then 
mix in the sugar quickly and lightly without beating 
it. 

Fruits Frappes, — Choose sound, ripe fruit, of as 
many kinds as you please (either fresh or canned, 
but drain the latter well), halving, quartering, or 
slicing them, as is most conyenient to get them into 
neat pieces ; have ready a syrup for mac^doine, 
flavoured with lemon- juice and a little brandy to 
taste (not too much), and pour this over the fruit, 
mixing it all gently, as you would salad, being 
careful not to break the fruit. Stand the bowl con- 
taining it in ice and salt, and cover it with a bright 
tin or stewpan lid, on which you pile more of the ice 
and salt, and let it stand until the syrup has almost 
set and glazed the fruit, which it should do in from 
twenty to thirty minutes ; there should be just 
enough syrup to moisten the fruit without being 
sloppy. It can then be served as it stands, with or 
without an accompaniment of whipped or frozen 
cream, lightly flavoured with vanilla, when it is 
known as fruit salad, or macedoine de fruits. If, 
however, when iced you pour on to it sufficient well- 
iced champagne to come level with the top of the 
fruit, it is known as fruits frappes au champagne, 
a dainty but easily prepared dish. 

en Macedoine is prepared a little 

differently ; the fruit itself is treated as in the pre- 
ceding recipe, and as before, the greater the variety 
the more luccessful will be the macedoine. Now for 

L 2

one and a half pints of fruit, measm*ed after it is 
l)eeled and cut up, boil three-quarters of a pound of 
cane loaf sugar in a pint and a haK of water till it is 
of the consistency of cream, and when it has cooled 
a little (but is still hot) lay in the fruit, add to it a 
full tablespoonf ul of nojeau or any other liqueur to 
taste, and the same of brandy (or rum, as you please) ; 
let it stand till cold, then bury it in ice as described 
above. Of course, if convenient, it can be set in the 
ice cave. If this niacedoine is intended for children, 
either use liqueur syrups, or omit liqueurs, and 
flavoiu* with a teaspoonful of essence of vanilla, 
and some strained lemon juice. This macedoine, if 
used when hot, makes a delici(ms garnish for many 
kinds of hot puddings, &c. 

Fruits, to mar blade* — Fruit for various pur- 
poses, such as for ice puddings, &c., is oft^n 
marinaded, or steeped, previous to use. For this put 
it in a soup or other deep plate, and sprinkk 
generously with caster suj^^ar. lemon juiw, vanilla, 
liqueur, or spirit according to tlie use you are to 
make of it. Turn another plate over it, and let it 
stand on ice till wanted. 

puree iced. — Poimd or crush through a 

sieve one pound of any nice fruit, with half a ixnmd 
of caster sugar (this of course depends on the 
sweetness of the fruit), the strained juice of a lemon, 
and a wineglassf ul of spirit or liqueur to taste, colour 
if required ; rub through a tammy and stand on 
ice or in the ice cave till wanted. This makes a 
delicious sauce for iced soufides and many other 
sweets.

Fruits, in Rum. — This is a GJerman inixtuii', 
and is particuIariT good iced, as a garnish for nioukUHl 
ices, savarins, &€., or it can be used as a puri'o, iis 
sauce, or as the foundation of sorbet ices, &o., tn 
taste. Have ready a large preserve jar aiul put into 
it a pint of good rum, then lay in the fruit as voii 
get them, stalked, stoned, and halved as nooo88arv. 
according to their nature, adding some at all (^hmjIs 
of the kernels of any stone fruit, blaucliod, to tin' 
mixture. Add to each layer of fruit as it is put in, 
an equal weight of roughly crushed cane loaf Hii^ai, 
and stir it well up from the bottom earh t.itno von 
make an addition, being careful not ti> break tln» iVnil 
in the process, and keeping it closely covimimI <loNvn 
with a moistened bladder. A pint of spirit. ( for rnni, 
brandy, whiskey, &c., may all be used as yon rlnMiHi*). 
is sufficient for six poimds of fruit, witli a p()nn«l ol 
the crushed cane loaf sugar for each ]K>\nnl of frnil. 
The great secret of this preserve is to liavo piM^footlv 
sound, ripe fruit, chosen when at their bcHt, anv 
the least mouldy, wet, or crushed, being rigoroiinlN 
excluded; the sugar must be pure cano sugar, n«» 
other will do, for the fruit is raw, remenil)er; and 
lastly, the spirit used must be sound and good of itn 
sort. You need not use Three 8t4ir (/ognar, 
naturally, but neither must you usci cheap brandy, 
which owes more of its fire to Hanibtirg than to tin* 
grape. (The use of inferior material is a fnMpwnt 
cause of the failure of home-made preserve's, liqiuMUM. 
Ac, be it observed by the way). For this prescrv*^ 
you can use cherries, strawberries, raspberries, melon, 
apricots, mulberries, plums, bYavikV^emft^, ^^.^\^i\.^\>i^%

tliem each in their season, if you choose, or you may 
restrict yourself to one kind of fruit. Strawbemes 
■for instance, allowing a pint of brandy and a gill of 
maraschino to every six pounds of fruit, and six 
pounds of sugar, make a most delicious compound, 
whilst mulberries treated thus are equally excellent 
^nd even more uncommon. Pineapple preserved in 
rum, with a dash of vanilla, or apricots also in rum, 
vnth a little noyeau again, are delicious. 

This compote must be kept for a month at least, 
before use. 

Wafers, — ^It is easiest, and possibly in towns, 
•cheaper to buy these, but they are not difficult to 
make at home, if you have the necessary wafer 
iron (Messrs. Jones Bros., "Down Street, Piccadilly, 
would supply these), or tongs, as they are often 
called. Prepare a nice batter with 12oz. of fine, 
•dried, and sifted flour, the yolks of four and the 
whites of six eggs, two tablespoonfuls of finely sifted 
«ugar, two tablespoonfuls of cream, and four table- 
spoonfuls of rose water (or any like amount of 
flavouring to taste) ; mix together the flour and 
sugar in a basin, then add the q%% yolks, and the 
-cream and rosewater previously lightly beaten to- 
gether, and prepare a batter (of the consistency of 
fritter batter) which will " drape " or cling to the 
spoon on lifting the latter. When you are ready to 
use it, stir in lightly and quickly the stiffly whipped 
^^'g whites. See that your wafer tongs are perfectly 
-clean and free from rust, brush them over well with 
eweet oil, and pour in just enough of the batter to 
<Joat the iron thinly, tVien. c\o^^ \)Mi \iq\i, and cook 



ODDS AND ENDS. 151 

over charcoal or gas. Mind thev do not catch ! As- 
soon as thev are cooked roll them round a wafer 
stick, and set them on end to dry. 

If you wish them to be pink, add a drop or two of 
carmine to the batter. Of course, their shape will 
vary according to the wafer irons you buy, while 
their flavour can be varied to suit your taste. 

Wafers a VAllemande. — Blanch a pound of 
sweet almonds, and slice them very thinly, then put 
them in a basin with 12oz. of caster sugar, and two 
good pinches of crisped orangeflowers, and mix it all 
to a paste with white of e^g. Cover clean baking 
sheets with wafer paper spread with white wax and 
a little sweet or almond oil, then spread the mixture 
as thinly as possible over this, strew it with chopped 
almonds or pistachios, and put the sheets in a 
rather hot oven ; when they are nearly done lift them 
out, quickly cut them into squares, replace them in 
the oven for a minute, and then roll the squares round 
a stick as before. As soon as they are cold lay them 
on a sieve and keep them covered. Very thin nougat 
can also be used in this way. Keep all these wafers 
in air-tight tins.

^LiTTLS, if any, originalitj is claimed for the 

>^ following recipes, most of which have appeared in 

^%the Cookery columns of the Queen during the 

* last eight or nine years, from whence they have 

JT)een collected at the request of many readers of 
the Queen, to save reference to back numbers not 
^^^Iways within reach. Additional recipes have, how- 
C^ ever, been given, to bring this little work as much 
^ up to date as possible; but all these, like the 
^ previous ones, have been carefully tested, and are 
i^ all (as I know from practical experience) well within 
V the capacity of any ordinary ** good plain cook," 
i gifted with fair intelligence and a little goodwill. 
r I desire also to take this opportunity of acknow- 
VJ ledging my indebtedness to the various authors of 
standard foreign cookery books, and also to offer 
my grateful thanks to Mrs. A. B. Marshall, and 
several other well-known chefs, whose kindness 
has so materially helped and rendered possible my 
work in these last years.

CHAPTER L 

ON THE CHOICE AND CUTTINa UP OF 

MEAT. 

CoMVOVi.T ifpealdng, the word "meat** is applied 
onlj to butcLer's meat, as it is railed, {,«., beef, real, 
mattoo, lamb, and pr>rk. BenideK these, howeTer, 
we can n;ckon for our joints on yeoinon, ponltrj, 
and game. In Franritf, and indeed abroad generallj, 
fish is often pleased into the serrioe to aet as the 
re/er^ or joint; but, though this is both a whole- 
some and pleasant Tarietr, fish "joints" need not 
be considered for the present 

It must be borne in mind that the housekeeper 
who knows the yarious joints, and also can distin- 
f^ish between good and inferior meat, is pkiced at a 
considerable adyantage over the woman who has to 
trust to her tradesman or her cook in this matter.

It may, therefore, be well to begin first by des- 
cribiug the appearance of the various kinds of meat. 

In beef the fat should be of a rich cream or pale 
butter colour ; if it is deep yellow, of a decided 
shade, the aniaial has probably been fed almost 
exclusively on oilcake, and its flesh will as a result 
be coarse and greasy. The fat should not be over- 
abundant, and if it is so distributed as to marble 
the meat delicately, the latter is pretty sure to be of 
excellent quality. The suet should be white and 
quite firm. The lean should be of a clear, bright, 
cherry-red, evenly and rather closely grained, and 
elastic to the touch. Any beef of a dark brown, 
almost livid, shade of red may be safely rejected as 
of inferior quality. The finest beef is obtained from 
Scotch bullocks, fed on old, long-established English 
pastures. Ox beef is the best, and indeed almost 
the only sort kept by good butchers, though heifei 
beef, which is lighter in colour and smaller in the 
bone than ox beef, is not to be despised. Bull beef 
is to be seen occasionally (though seldom, if ever, at 
a first-rate butcher's), but is easily detected by its 
deeper colour, coarser grain, and unpleasant smell. 
In choosing beef, look, if possible, at the kidney, as 
this is a pretty safe test, a good one being of a deep 
rosy red, with firm, elastic, and cream-coloured fat 
whilst that of an inferior beast will almost certainly 
be of a dark purplish brown, and deficient in fat, 
while what there is of it will be rather flabby and 
pinky in colour. Over-fat beef is always wasteful, 

.d in general rather coarse; but over-lean leeE 
lys bad feeding and probable toughness. It

may be well to give the young housewife the benefit 
of M. GoufPe's advice on the subject of meat and its 
choice. This well-known chef says : " First of all 
make a point of acquainting yourself with the 
current prices of the articles you intend purchasing ; 
never rely solely on one tradesman, nor place entire 
confidence in his statements, but trust a good deal 
to your own judgment; very few, even of the most 
superior provision dealers, can resist the temptation 
of relieving themselves of doubtful commodities at 
the expense of an inexperienced customer." This 
advice is, of course, given to French housewives, who 
do their own marketing in many cases, which is a 
practice few British housekeepers have time or 
opportunity for. Still, it is a good thing to visit 
occasionally even so unattractive a shop — as it is to 
many women — as a butcher's, as you learn a good deal 
in that way (remember, unless you think it worth 
while to look after your own interests, no one else 
will), and you will soon see how differently 
customers are treated. The woman who insists on 
getting the joint of the size and kind she requires, 
ruthlessly returning the one that does not come up 
to her mark, soon becomes known, and is respected 
(and, if a good and practically ready-money customer, 
also feared) accordingly. For her you will see the 
dainty well-floured little joints hanging up labelled ; 
no makeweight in the shape of superfluous bone or 
fat will find its way into her house ; the butcher is 
far too well aware of the result of such treatment to 
venture on it. At the same time, it must be remem- 
bered that the cook needs as much watchfulness as 

B 2 



4 MEATS. 

i\\e Imtcher. If dishonesi., she will allow the trades- 
men to send inferior f,i;oods whilst charging for the 
primest quality, and will encourage a proportion of 
fat with every joint that no good housekeeper would 
ever dream of permitting, as it increases her per- 
quisite of dripping and kitchen fat. Insist on a 
ticket bearinor tlie date and weight of each joint 
acAjompanying it into the house, and resolutely 
enforce the apj)earance of these tickets each week 
when the butcjher's book comes up for payment. 
Also now and again pay a surprise visit at the time 
of the butcher* s visit, and see the meat he has 
brought and verify its weight for yourself. This 
will often open your eyes as to the discrepancy 
between the weight of the meat as in your butcher's 
book and the look of the joint on the table. More- 
over, a careless cook without the least dishonesty 
will waste and then throw the blame on the 
tradesman. 

To return, however, to our beef. Where economy 
has to be considered, frozen meat is often bought, 
and if obtained from a trustworthy source and pro- 
perly treated will be little inferior to the average 
home-fed beef, though it must be confessed that natu- 
rally it will not bear comparison with n^ally first-rate 
English-fed Scotch ox beef. Foreign meat is judged 
in much the same way as the home-grown, though a 
somewhat darker purplish tone of the flesh tints, in 
the round especially, may be observed. It is also 
moister on the surface than English beef ; but be 
careful in this matter, for foreign beef badly, or too 
rapidly, thawed will '* weep," as it is teohnically

be from two to four months old. 

Mutton, to be in po-fection, should be at least four 
years old, a park-fed wether of four or five jeMn 
beiiig esteemed the most perfect mutton obtainaUe, 
Nowadays such perfection is seldom attaiuied, sare 
in some very large households, where a small flock is 
kept up for family use. Next to this nmtton come 
the down and hill mutton. The sheep fed on the 
salt marshes, the pre-sal^ of the French, or our 
own down mutton fed near the sea coast, are cases 
in point. This mutton is usually black-faced, and 
smaller in bone and build than the ordinarv inland- 
fed sheep, though the locally famous Bonmey 
Marsh mutton, when in perfection, combines size 
with flavour. 

It is not difficult to tell the age of a sheep with 
a little care. Look at the breast bones when the 
shoep is " dressed," as it is technically called when 
prepared for show in the shop. If these bones are 



a MEATS. 

quite red, the sheep is little more than a lamb, and 
under a year old ; if the bones are beginninor to 
whiten at the upper anl lower bones, though the 
middle of the breast bone is still reddish, the animal 
is between one and two years ; and thenceforward 
the bones will grow more generally white till at four 
years old they are perfectly white. Always choose 
small-boned, rather small mutton, with very white 
and firm waxy fat, not too abundant, but evenly 
distributed, the lean being of a purple-brown of a 
darkish tint when freshly cut, whilst if seen 
through the skin of the leg it is apt to look quite 
purple ; it should be fine in the grain, plump- 
looking, and much drier than beef on the surface. 
Well-hung good mutton looks quite dry, whilst its 
colour darkens almost to black ; such meat is always 
good. In cool, dry weather, in an airy dry larder, 
mutton will hang advantageously for a fortnight to 
three weeks, and at any time should hang a week 
before eating. Like beef, frozen mutton is coming 
into use, though it is not so popular as it deserves 
to be for two reasons ; one is the trouble in thawiug 
it properly, the second is that when thawed it is 
very apt to look anything but appetising in its raw 
state. Unthawed, the fat is perfectly white, and 
the lean is of a very pale pink shade ; when, however, 
it is thawed it looks very often as if in an advanced 
stage of decomposition, especially if seen through 
the skin, as on the leg, whim it has an absolutely 
appalling range of colouring, from a greenish yellow 
to a deep purple. All this, however, disappears 
^hen it is cooked ; and if properly treated, frozen

fimi-rate boaie-grown mutton, ui at all eventv deci- 
dedlj superior to a great deal of r0^>-called) finglinb* 
mutton, Bememl>er that the bent waj to thaw this 
meat is to hang it for several hours either in the 
kitchen or in some place of about the same tem* 
|jerature, remembering that it should, save in very 
dry, cold weather^ be cooked as soon as it is projicrly 
thawed. Bememljer, also, that owing to the extra 
quantity of moisture it possesses, joints of it sbriuld 
be hung with the uncut [>art down, t.^., in hanging a 
leg lie sure to hang it by the thiek part, leaving the 
shank end down — or, in thawing, the juice would run 
out at the cut (lart. This is, by tlie way, one great 
reason for the prejudice against frozen meat, as 
being ^* so 'Iry/' One more ntiUt aliout thawing meat, 
and a gruesome one. Be careful where it is hung, as 
all moisture is attracted by <x>ld, and any steam or 
exhalations from drains, ^\, will Infallibly gather 
round the nu^it, and, as the frost in the lattf^r gives, 
will taint and corrupt it. 

Lamb should l>e plump, a palt; brownish pink in 
the lean, with o|^line and ixrin, liard fat. A faiut 
bluish tinge is generally noticeable in the htiUtr, I5e 
sure the butcher always unudn a piece of " caul '* (a 
thin, semi-transparent membrane) over the fat Up 
protect it whilst roasting. " Hoiise latiib'' is in 
reason from Christujiis to Lady Day, and is so-called 
from its having lieen bom alx^ut midwinter, and, 
c^>nsequently, reared under shelter and prin<;i[>ally 
fed on milk, '' Q^rass Lamb '' succee^ls to this, and is 
the young lamb brought up naturally^ more or less 



8 MEATS. 

out of doors, on the jouog spring grass. Lamb, to 
be in perfection, should be from four to five months 
old. 

Fresh pork requires great ijare in its choice, and 
should never be bought from any but a first-rate 
source; moreover, it should never be used in the 
summer, as it is then absolutely unhealthy. It 
should be small, and not too fat. For eating fresh, 
a pig of five to six score (lOOlb. to 1201b.) should be 
chosen, as it gives the nicest and daintiest joints. The 
fat should be a pure white, free from any bruises or 
discolou rations, which (like kernels in the flesh) 
betray unhealthiness. The lean should be of a faint 
mushroom pink, closely and finely grained, and per- 
fectly even in texture. For eating fresh, a " porker," 
i.e., a pig of one year or under, should be chosen. 

It is well to bear in mind, when choosing meat, 
that the smaller, in reason, the more appetising the 
meat is. This is specially the case where a small 
family has to be catered for. For instance, 41b. to 
61b. is an ample- sized piece for a few people; but 
when taken from a large beast, if the ribs or sirloin 
be chosen, it will look like nothing but an overgrown 
chop ; whereas if cut from a small animal, a piece of 
equal weight will be a neat miniature joint. This 
applies to all animals, to none, however, more forcibly 
than to oxen. But butchers will not supply this as 
a rule to any but regular and valued customers, as 
small meat is by no means so profitable to them. 

Having settled on tlie meat you intend to buv, it is 
well to have a clear notion of what joints there are 
and wo may as well begin with beef. 



CHOICE AND CUTTING IIP OF MEAT. & 

The usual jiiinis are the sirloin, the rilw, the mund 
or the io[>side, the brisket, the aitchlxme, and the 
buttock, or silTerside, as it is aleo called. Besides 
th«;8e there are inferior picoes, such as the thick and 
thin flank, the chuck and middle ribs, the leg of 
mutton piece, the shin, and the neck, clod or 
sticking piece. These the wholesale butcher easily 
recognises, but individual and family wants have 
created a d- ^nand for yarious cuts, and in conse- 
4|iience the side of dead meat cut up by the local 
butcher often differs in some |K>intR from the plan of 
the wholesale salesman. 

A sirloin may be roasted whole with the fillet or 
undercut, or it may be boned, rolled, and roasted ; 
or the fillet may be removed, in which case it is 
almost always boned and rolled. When a^sirloin is 
▼ery large and long boned it is better to divide it as 
above, removing the streaky square piece at the end, 
which may be either used for baked Irish stew, or it 
may be salted and then boiled. 

A fiUet or undercut may be larded and roasted, or 
braised whole, as a miniature joint, or it may be 
sliced down for fillets or small steaks. Abroad the 
bifUck, or filet, is always cut from this part, as it is 
more tender than other portions of the meat ; but in 
England the rump steak is preferred because of its 
superior flavour. 

The ribs may be either roasted whole, or they may 
be boned, rolled, and either roasted or braised. It 
should be borne in mind that in choosing ribs for 
one's joint it is well to stipulate for the " foreribs," 
i.e., those neit to ilie sirloin, as the ** middle " and 



10 MEATS. 

" chuck ribs," sometimes called the " wing ribs,** 
have the bones so long as to produ(ie a most 
ungainly joint, and are not economical from the 
large proportion of bone to meat they possess. 

The rump is the portion from which are cut the 
finest steaks for broiling ; when cut in a piece witL 
the two sirloins, saddle fashion, it forms what is 
called the " baron of beef," a joint more often heard 
of than seen. 

The aitchbone f just under the rump, is roasted, 
but more frequently slightly salted and stewed or 
boiled. Its chief objection is the ungainly bone in 
the centre of it. 

The round comes next. The round is often divided 
in two, the inner side being called the topside or 
"tender 'round,*' the outer one being known as 
the silverside. The whole round is usually roasted ; 
or else spiced, stewed, and pressed, and then served 
as " spiced beef." When divided, the topside, from 
its freedom from bone and superfluous fat, forms 
a most economical roast, though the meat is perhaps 
hardly so line as that of the sirloin. 

The siiverside is usually salted and boiled, though 
if stewed fresh with vegetables, spice, &c., it makes 
a most excellent joint. It is economical to buy a 
good piece of the round, as it can hang, and will 
then afford excellent steak for pies and puddings, 
and even for frying, though, of course, not so deli- 
cate as the rumpsteak, but it is delicious as stewed 
steak. It must be remembered that, as these last 
joints have no bone and little or no fat of their own, 
the butcher will, unless checked for it, all but invari-

ably send a " makeweight/' as he caMn it, of ti'iihi*T 
bone or extraneous suet, as lar^e as he thinks th(^ 
inexperience of the custo ner, or the (.-arelessness of 
the oook, will permit. 

The veiny piece lies below the round, and is i]M<,*d 
for inferior steak, and is also most excellent for 
stews, ragouts, &c. 

The flanks, thick and thin, come next ; the ihu-.k 
flank next to the veiny piece, whilst the thin fiauk 
divides the thick one from the brisk<ft The thick 
flank boils and stews admirablv, whilst i\u* thin 
flank is excellent for soup or broth, an<l for cjAlarini^. 
The best "mutton" broth is made from this tiiin 
flank of beef (if the bull maj l>e forgiv«Mi;, though 
in Scotland it is often replaced by the " runn«'r," 
thick or thin, which is shown in the diagram giving 
the Scotch method of cutting up l»eef. 

The hnsket, which answers to the breast ol mutton, 
is not so delicate for salting and plain Ixiiling as tlie 
silverside ; but if salted and slightly spiced, st^fwi'd 
with vegetables, pressed, and allowed in *ooI in ifs 
own gravy, produces a most delicate* Iun« li or break- 
fast dish. Its only fault is a tendency U) an undtie 
amount of fat. 

The leg of mutton piece is in reality the top oi the 
foreleg, and though, like the vein v piece of the thi( k and 
thin flanks, butchers contemn it as " inf"rior," it is 
most juicy and excellent if hung, e.speciallv lor ragouts, 
for which indeed in France it is usually reserved. 

The neck, clod or "sticking piece" as it is also 
called, is used for stock making, and for clarifying 
soup. 



12 MEATS. 

The hough and the shin are also used Tor what 
cooks call " gravy meat," though for this in reality a 
coarse strip known as the '* skirt " is to be prefeiTed, 
and very often the top of the hough, if nicely stewed, 
will produce an excellent dish of stewed steak, &c. 

The ox-head makes excellent brawn and soup, and 
the cheek if nicely spiced, seasoned, and stewed, will 
produce a very appetising " stew " for household use. 
The tail is used for soup, and also for entrees, as are 
also the liver, sweet and throat breads, the palate, &c. 

The heart is good, roast or stewed; whilst the feet 
or " heels " make good jelly, and when stewed, a 
most nourishing dish for invalids. But for these the 
beast must be young. 

There is a joint well known in America, and much 
appreciated also at home, known as " a porterhouse 
steak." This is simply a rib cut ofE like a chop from 
the loin of mutton. It is expensive, as it must be cut 
from the sirloin to ensure the undercut. It is broiled. 

Veal is usually divided into the loin (corresponding 
to the sirloin), the best end of the neck (or the ribs 
of beef), the chump (which answers to the rump and 
aitchbone of beef cut into one piece), the fillet (or 
round of beef), and the neck, breast, and shoulder, 
which answer exactly to similar pieces in mutton. In 
fact, veal is cut up partly like beef and partly like 
sheep. An illustration is also given of the French 
mode of cutting up veal, as it helps to explain many 
foriiign recipes. 

The loin is roasted, so also is the nech ; the fillet 
is used for fricandeau, cutlets, &c. ; the bretisl can 
bo stewed, braised, or collared; the shoulder is 



CHOICE AND CtTTTTNG UP OF MEAT. 13 

roasteil, or boned, Rtnffefl an«l stewfHl ; whilst the 
knuckle of Teal, answi^ring to the Lough or shin of 
beefy is excellent for stock, and also for stewing. All 
skin and bone from veal should be utilised for soup, 
being peculiarlj gelatinous and delicate. It must be 
remembered that the udder, or the firm white fat 
attached to the fillet, and the kidnev suet are 
especiallj delicate, and arc always (airefully reserved 
by French eooks for the pre]>aration of all kinds of 
delicate forcemeat where they replac^e iht» butter 
usually used for the purpose in England. 

In mutton, the leg, the haunch {i.e., the leg and 
part of the loin), the loin, and the saddle (the two 
loins cut in one) are the best roasting joints, though 
the hest end of the neck will also make a neat little 
joint for a small family, whilst a well-hung and a 
well-roasted shoulder is certainly not to be despised, 
with all due deference to the smart club man, who 
imagined " Awh ! shouldah of mutton ! Why, don't 
they make glue from that?" A shoulder also, if 
boned, stuffed, aud rolled, is good whether braised or 
roaj&ted. For boiling, the leg and the neck are to be 
preferred, whilst the breast, if not too fat, is good 
rolled and stuffed, or collare<l. 

Lamb is cut up and treated much like mutton, 
save in the early part of the season, when it is simply 
cut into four quarters and roasted. 

In pork the divisions are the leg ; the loin which 
contains the loin and the chump end (answering to 
the sirloin and rum[> of beef) ; the neck, from the end 
Df the loin to the serag, locally often callt^ the 
'sparerib"; the belly or spring (answering to the 



14 MEATS. 

the thin flank or brisket of beef) ; and shoulder. 
sometimes also called the " hand,'' which includes 
both the shoulder and the breast. The sparerib, th€ 
loin, and the leg are all roasted ; the leg is also ofter 
slightly salted and then boiled, treatment alsc 
bestowed on the hand, which is usually too fat tc 
roast well. The spring is slightly salted, boiled, and 
then usually served cold, for breakfast or lunch. 

The head, after removing the cheeks, is usually 
made into brawn, the tongue, feet, and ears being 
mixed with it. 

This will give a general idea of the method of 
cutting up and utilising the various parts of the 
animals. The average weights, roughly speaking, 
are as follows : — 

Beef — Sirloin, from 61b. or 61b. (if small) to 141b. 
Bibs, 2ab. or 3lb. to 141b. 
Aitchbone, 81b. to 16lb. 
Brisket, 41b. to 121b. 
Round of beef, 41b. to 241b. upwards. 
Fillet, lib. up to 61b. or 8lb. 
Porterhouse steak, 2Jlb. to 3Jlb., according 
to size of beef. 
Mutton — Leg, from 91b. to 101b.

This average is for medium -sized mutton (always 
the best, as heavier meat is as a rule much (!oaraer 
than the smaller kind). Piozen meat generally 
runs from lib. to 21b. smaller for each joint, whilst 
Welsh or moor-fed sheep is but little more than half 
the weight, joint for joint, of the ordinary mutton.

Bkkp in jomts maj be roasted, baked, stewed, 
braifled, or boiled as taste and conreDience dictate, 
though in most cases nowadays tbe first process, 
roasting in front of an open fire, is seldom managed, 
thanks to dose ranges; bnt, nndoabtedhr, meat 
cooked in this waj is infinitely superior to a joint 
that has been baked, however carefaQj the cooking 
has been managed. Of old roasting was the great 
talent of the British cook, who appeared bom with 
the instinct of the roaster and broiler (and remember 
a great French authority declared ^ on dement 
euitmiery mats on naU roHsseur "), a great gift, for 
indeed roasting almost needs instinct. Fires differ 
in intensity ; the meat differs in substance, in thick- 
ness, in grain; the yery temperature affects the 
period required to bring the joint to perfection, Ac, 
so that it is no easy matter to decide just the time 
that will be needed to roast or bake a joint. 
Boughly speaking, for thick pieces, such as the sir- 
loin, the round, Ac., twenty minutes to the pound, 
and fifteen minutes over will be found a fair average, 



22 MEATS. 

whilst for thin pieces, such as ribs, &c., fifteen 
minutes for each pound, and fifteen minutes over 
will be ample. Yet a good deal has to be considered 
even with these averages. Always test a joint before 
lifting it from the fire by pressing the thickest 
part with the finger; if it gives, the meat is ready, 
if it resists, however slightly, it is not thoroughly 
cooked. In roasting, be careful to have the fire pro- 
perly made up, and keep it duly replenished from 
the back, so as never to let it get low, and always to 
keep a bright surface towards the meat. Of course, 
if the fire is let down, the roasting of the meat 
suffers. Again, attention must be paid to draughts ; 
a screen should always be placed round the meat 
and fire to exclude these, or the joint will take much 
longer to cook. It should be for the first ten 
minutes, as near as may be to the fire without 
actually scorching it, so as to close the pores of the 
meat on the surface, thus retaining the gravy, and 
preventing the hardening and consequent toughening 
of the albumen, a substance contained in all meats 
— and also in eggs — on which the nutritive value of 
both depends. (The principle is the same as in 
frying, when the substance to be fried is plunged 
into so-called boiling fat to crisp and close up the 
surface.) This being accomplished, the meat should 
be drawn a little away from the fire and allowed to 
cook more slowly. An important part to be noted 
is the basting; this consists of pouring the gravy 
and fat that has ''dripped" from the joint at 
intervals over it to keep the surface moist ; this pro- 
cess should be re^x^ated frequently during the

When meat is baked, it takes about hhe .^ame f.imt^ 
as for roasting, but it requires (and only f^v^ 
seldom gets) also equal attrition in the matf^r of 
basting. In baking, the plan of wrappmsf th« joint

be, if attention is paid to the basting. TJnfortu- 
natelj, most cooks appear to think that when thej 
have rolled up the meat in the prepared paper and 
put it in the oven, their responsibilty ceases until the 
clock tells them it is time to lift the joint from the 
oven. It is to this in reality that so much of the 
dislike to baked meat is due. If baked meat is 
ever to be satisfactory it must be remembered that 
a special double roasting tin is indispensable. It 
consists of two tins, the outer one of which is filled 
with boiling water (a supply of this being carefully 
kept up), the inner one acting as dripping-pan, 
whilst the meat to be cooked rests on the gridiron 
on top, and so does not sodden from lying in the 
gravy, as it does in the ordinary baking tin. In 
some houses the gas stoYe has a roasting oven specially 
prepared for this purpose, and, in that case, with 
proper attention, there should be little difference 
between meat thus treated and that cooked at an 
open fire. 

Broiling, like roasting, implies the direct action of 
the fire, and, indeed, the scorched, or " fire " taste is 
considered by connoisseurs indispensable for any- 
thing cooked by this process. The meat to be 
cooked, after trimming, should be placed oyer a 
clear, glowing fire, without smoke or flame, on a 
gridiron (previously heated, then brushed over with 
a piece of suet or white wax, and then again heated 
when the steak is placed on it) and one side is allowed 
to cook for about a minute; it is then carefully 
turned and the other side aiTm\aTVy \>TQaAi^VKsxTi\i\<^

at a hand gallop, then throws in salt d discretion (or 
rather indiacretion), adds in what she considers suitable 
vegetables, or very possibly forgets these till it is 
time to put in the suet dumplings always accom- 
panying British boiled beef, and lets the wretched 
thing cook at the same violent speed, till the proper (P) 
time has been expended, when she forks it out, 
and is very much surprised to find it a stringy, 
leathery mass, redolent of nothing but the saltpetre 
used in pickling it, with a pulpy mash of vegetables 
boiled to rags, and some lividly-white bullets of suet 
paste that give one indigestion only to think of! 
Needless to say that the liquor in which the ill- 
treated joint was cooked, and which naturally con- 
tains all the nutriment that has not flown off in 
steam, is promptly emptied down the sink, fat and 
all, regardless of its merits as foundation stock for 
all kinds of broths and pur&s, whilst the fat, 
declared by an eminent French chef to be the best 
frying fat procurable, goes to clog the unfortunate 
and never-flushed sink waste-pipe ! 

For boiling, allow the same time as for roasting, 
i.e., twenty minutes to the pound and fifteen minutes 
over, cooking sharply at first, allowing it to simmer 
only afterwards till cooked. Remember, save when 
wanted for soup, meat should always be put on in 
hailing salted water, allowed to return to the boil 
(from which the cold meat throws it off), then kept 
boiling for five minutes after reaching the boil, after 
which it is drawn a little to the side and kept 
simmering only, steadily, till done. For salting 
water the usual allowance is two good tablespoouf uls

diminishes the risk of bftming. Some p<>opIe first

heating a little dripping (say an oance for 2Tb, cfr 
SVb. of meat), then laying in the meat, An,, and 
frying it for twelve to fifteen minutes till lightly

the whole finished off as before. Cooked thua, it is

bottom, the hot ashes (braise) being placed on the 
strong rib-edged lid i of the pan prepared for the 
purpose. It differs from stewing in the fact that 
the meat to be cooked is more properly steamed thaD 
even simmered ; the yegetables and other accessories 
being placed in the bottom of the pan in a monnd, 
the meat placed on this, and only just sufficient 
liquid poured in at the side to come up to, but 
barely reach, the meat, which is coYered with a 
buttered paper, the hot ashes then placed on the 
close-fitting lid, and the whole allowed to cook gently 
over, but not on, the fire ; nowadays, when our ovens 
are arranged with both top and bottom heat, the 
meat to be braised is, when thus prepared, placed in 
the oven and cooked gently, care being taken to 
keep it delicately basted at intervals over the paper. 
Some cooks gently fry the vegetables, meat, &c., as 
described for the stewed steak, before adding the 
liquid, which must be carefully renewed as it evapo- 
rates. It takes from twelve to fifteen minutes for 
the initial frying. With regard to the time taken 
for either stewing or braising, it is difficult to be 
accurate, as size and thickness naturally must be 
considered. As a general principle, from thirty to 
forty minutes for the pound for a thick piece is the 
least that is needed, whilst for a steak, if tender, 
one and a half hours will be sufficient for quite a 
large piece. 

All meat before cooking should be neatly trimmed 
and fastened into shape either by skewers or tapes. 
The meat should also be carefully weighed after 
preparation to ensure the proper allowance of 



BEEP. 29 

time, and all the points alluded to aboTe, such as 
thicknessy condition^ &c., studiously attended to. 
Lastly, there is one point to be mentioned before 
proceeding to specify recipes, aud that is the question 
of cleanliness. The average English cook, and eyen 
the areragelj weU-taught cookery teacher, insists 
that no meat intended for roasting, <&c., should ever 
be washed, but simply wiped o?er with a damp cloth. 
Now, with all due deference to authority^ I confess 
that I follow the Jewish custom (and please note 
that their longevity and general freedom from 
epidemics is held to be due to their sanitary care 
in the matter of food), and uphold the absolute 
necessity of washing eYerj bit of meat that comes 
into the house, a necessity that no one who has once 
allowed their imagination to reconstruct either an 
open butcher's shop, or the carts coming from market, 
to be seen in our streets will dare deny. The Jewish 
plan is to place the meat in a pan kept for the 
purpose, then cover it from the tap with cold water, 
and let it stand for half an hour ; after which every 
clot of blood is well washed off, the meat is then 
placed on a salting board (a basket lid, or a board 
perforated with holes), in a slanting position to let 
the water drain off ; after this, finely powdered salt 
is carefully strewed on the meat in every part, and 
it is again left for an hour; it is then well 
rinsed three times in fresh water, and, lastly, is 
carefully dried in a clean cloth. This is called 
'' koshering." Now, without being quite so parti- 
cular, I do consider it well to thoroughly wash the 
meat when brought into the house, then drying it

very carefully in a clean doth, after which it is 
treated in the usual way. 

Romt sirloin of beef. — Trim the meat neatly into 
shape, and weigh it ; now skewer it into place, tieing 
it up if preferred ; then rub it all over with clarified 
beef dripping, and tie it up in a paper generously 
spread with either dripping or butter (the former 
for choice), and roast or bake it, being careful to put 
it to the hottest part of the fire or oven for the first 
part of the time. Keep it well basted, and allow it 
to cook twenty minutes to the pound, removing the 
paper half an hour before the meat is done, and 
allowing it to brown. When ready, remove the 
skewers, replacing them with plated ones if neces- 
sary, and serve on a hot dish, with a little of its 
own gravy round it. (For this, pour off the fat very 
carefully from the dripping pan, and then add some 
(not too much) boiling water, or, if liked, good stock 
instead, stirring this well round to absorb all the little 
browned blisters of gravy that will be found adhering 
to the pan ; let it all just boil up and use.) Beef 
roasted in this way can be served with any garnish, 
such as horseradish, &c., to taste. Any joint can be 
roasted according to these directions, and served 
with any nice garnish to taste. If to be eaten cold, 
the meat should be roasted till cooked, then lifted 
out into a pan and allowed to get cool untouched ; 
in this way it will be found particularly juicy, as the 
gravy will still be in it ; dose observation will show 
how the gravy, or juice, runs out on being first cut.

(raw), mixed with a little fat bacon or ham, and used 
as stuffing for a vegetable marrow, cucumber, ^., 
or it will make excellent Irish or Welsh stew (given 
later). Thus, a sirloin will afford a small family 
three separate and fresh joints, which, where cold 
and recooked meat is objected to, is a consideration.

some poultry trimmings (neck, legs, gizzards, ^.), 
and bring this all to the boil as slowly as possible.

of water, i.e., rather less than one and three-quarter

a very different dish from what is called " soup-

brandy, or a gill of cooking wine, and some well- 
washed bacon rinds are a great addition to either 
stewed or braised beef. 

The above directions will show how the ordinary 
joints may be cooked, but perhaps it may be well to 
mention a few smaller joints, and some from so- 
called inferior parts which come in very handy for 
small families. 

Fillet of beef. — ^Remove all the superfluous fat 
taken from 31b. or 41b. of beef fillet, tie it neatly 
into shape, and marinade for one or two hours with 
oil or clarified butter, sliced carrot, turnip, herbs of 
all kinds, peppercorns, and sliced lemon. When to 
be cooked wrap the fillet in a well-greased sheet of 
paper, strewing it with the marinade, vegetables, and 
a few drops of oil. Fasten it up tightly, and roast or 
bake it, basting it generously, and cook it for about 
two hours for 4jlb. or 61b. of meat. Then remove the 
paper, and brown it a little in front of the fire, after 
wiping off the herbs, &c., and serve garnished with 
horseradish or horseradish sauce in a boat, and any 
good brown sauce to taste, round it. The fillet can 
aJso be larded with nice lardons of fat bacon rolled 
in quatre epices, carefully trimming them with a pair 



BEEF. 35 

of scissors, tying the meat into a mrai »hajie, and 
either roasting or braising it to taute, like any other 
piece of meat. Fillet of beef, being somewhat 
expensive, is usually served with very rich sancefi and 
accessories. A nice piece cut from the round at the 
top of the leg is often used instead of the fillet, if the 
latter is to be braised, and if the j>roce«» iii carried 
out carefuUv it makes a dish little inferior to the 
more aristocratic cut. Unfortunatelv, Britiiih house- 
wives seldom appear to realise that a nicely -€<^>oked 
" inferior " joint, from a weU-fed, well-kept bea«t is 
much to be preferred to the " best " joints of a less 
delicately-fed animal. 

Beef en casserole (or Welsh stew). — Cat up 21b. 
or 31b. of thick flank or leg of mutton piece of beef 
into neat pieces, lay it in a pan with aV/ut a quart 
of cold water or bone stock, bring this to the lx>il, then 
let it stew very gently for an hour, when you add io 
it either twenty-four button or silver onions, or the 
white part of ten or twelve h^ka, and five or six 
young turnips sliced, a lump of loaf sugar, a small 
teaspoonfid of salt, and half that quantity of white 
pepper, and let it all stew gently together for one 
and a quarter to one and a half hours. Either turn 
it all out on to a hot dish, or serve it in the c^asserole

round, fillet, or even the leg of mutton piece, into neat 
pieces, and toss these with some button onions in 
either butter, oil, or well clarified beef dripping, till 
lightly coloured, then turn them all into a casserole. 
or an earthenware marmite (a jugging pot answers

admirably), with some finger-long and thick strips of 
bacon or ham, a full bouquet garni (bayleaf, thyme, 
parsley, green onions, a blade of mace, two or three 
cloves, and a strip of lemon peel, all tied up together), 
with a couple of mushrooms, or a sliced tomato or 
so (with truffles if handy) ; pour over all this eithei 
three-quarters of a pint of Burgundy or a quarter the 
quantity of sherry and the same of stock, an ounce 
of glaze or Lemco, and seasoning to taste. Cover 
this down closely, and let it cook very gently in the 
oven with heat top and bottom. In using sherry be 
careful not to overdo it ; for an average dish a fair- 
sized sherry glassful mixed with an equal quantity 
of strong stock will be found ample ; skim well. 

Porterhouse steak. — Cut one or more slices fully 
l|in. thick off the thickest part of the sirloin, with 
the fillet or undercut attached, making it look like a 
gigantic loin (mutton) chop. Flatten this meat 
slightly with a cutlet bat or a heavy cook's knife, 
brush it over with good oil or liquefied butter, 
pepper lightly with freshly- ground black pepper, and 
grill the steak for fifteen to twenty minutes, according 
to thickness and the amount of cooking desired. 
This steak can then be served in a variety of ways ; 
a pat of u-ny savoury butter (such as anchovy, 
maitre d'hdtel, Perigord, or many other butters) 
being placed on the hot dish, the steak laid on it, and 
another laid on the top, so that it is well melted over 
the meat by the time the latter reaches the dining- 
room. It can also be served with broiled mush- 
rooms or tomatoes cooked thus : Put 2oz. of butter or 
clarified drippiug in the pan, and lay into this (when 



BEEF. 37 

melted) five or six tomatoes halved, skin side down- 
wards, and let them fry for five minutes without 
turning; when the steak and the tomatoes are 
cooked, salt both lightly, dish on a very hot dish, 
either with or without the savoury butter, and 
garnish with the tomatoes, horseradish sauce, or any 
other sauce to taste. 

Another form of this dish is prepared as follows, 
though for this a very thick slice is generally 
chosen instead of the rib steak : Cut the meat fully 
2in. thick, and slit it halfway through horizontally, 
lay inside it a thickish layer of d'uxelles mixture with 
a minced anchovy and a very little minced tarragon ; 
fold the steak back into shape, brush it over with a 
little oil or clarified butter, and broil it for twelve or 
fifteen minutes till three parts cooked. Now lift it 
off the grid, lay it on a sheet of buttered paper pre- 
viously spread with some more of the d^iixelles, place 
a little more of the latter on top of the meat, fold 
the paper over tightly, and finish off over the fire or in 
a sharp oven till the paper browns lightly and puffs 
out, and serve very hot without removing the paper. 
This is sometimes called ** Chateaubriand fourr^," 
and the filling may be varied according to taste and 
convenience. 

Boiled steak. — This makes a very nice small joint, 
and can be made from various parts of the animal, 
viz. : with rump steak, round, leg of mutton piece, or 
even the flank, as preferred. Cut a rather large 
steak about l^in. thick, flatten it out and trim 
neatly, then sprinkle the inner side with fine salt and 
cayenne; have ready a roll of any nice foi:e^\jt!L<^"^«^

taste, also neatly shaped, and place this at one end. 
of the steak, rolling the meat over it, tying it into 
shape, and, if to be roasted or baked, wrapping it in 
a sheet of paper generously spread with either 
butter, oil, or clarified dripping, and cook for one 
and a half to two hours, according to size. (If an 
inferior part of the beast is taken, it is better to 
braise or stew this dish, first frying it to a delicate 
brown with its vegetables, and one or two pieces of 
bacon rind, or a slice or two of smoked ham.) 
When nearly ready, say about twenty minutes before 
it is cooked, remove the paper, lightly flour the roll, 
and keep it well basted till it is perfectly cooked, 
and serve with any good brown or tomato sauce. The 
forcemeat may vary to any extent, from plain veal 
forcemeat of herbs, breadcrumb, &c., to sausage- 
meat, oyster farce, or the following, when the rolled 
steak is to be used for a dinner party : Mince finely 
and mix well lib. nice lean and ^Ib. fat pork, |oz. 
salt, Joz. white pepper (or preferably an ounce of 
qtmtre epices, or Gouffe's mixture), half a teaspoonf ul 
of finely minced parsley, thyme, and shallot ; then 
add about 4oz. of truffles, sliced or cut into small 
cubes (or if these are not obtainable fresh, use the 
contents of a small jar of pate de foie gras truffe), 
and a glass of sherry or Madeira. When this farce 
is used, roast or bake the meat (which should in this 
case be the best rump steak), and keep it well 
covered with a generously buttered paper, crisping 
it at the last in the oven, by setting it in a rather 
deep baking dish, with a small half bottle of 
champagne j brush the meat over with thin glaze, and 



BEEF. 89 

keep basting it with the wine till it is crisp and 
brown on the surface, and the wine is mostly 
absorbed. Dish on a hot dish and serre with a 
puree of either spinach or mushrooms, with 
champagne sauce, handed round. If preferred, the 
meat may be basted with half stock, half sherry, and 
be served with a rich Perigeux sauce. For ordinary 
purposes tomato sauce may be recommended. 

Brisket of heef alVagro dolce. (A Jewish dish.) — 
Choose a nice piece of brisket or thick flank, not too 
fat, of, say, 2^1b. to 41b., and put it on with sufficient 
water to cover it, bring it gently to the boil, then 
draw it to the side of the stove and let it simmer 
gently, but steadily, for two and a half hours ; then 
add to it 21b. of French beans, strung and cut as for 
boiling, one small Spanish onion sliced, with pepper 
and salt to taste, and let it stew gently for another 
half hour, or until the beans are nearly done ; now 
pour on to a small teacupful of brown sugar (say 
3oz. to 4oz.) as much good vinegar as it will absorb ; 
then add this to the stew and finish cooking the 
beans for a few minutes, shaking the pan, or gently 
stirring up its contents all the time, to get the sugar 
and vinegar well mixed into the rest of the ingre- 
dients. Another dish somewhat similar to this is 
made with haricot beans. Soak from three-quarters 
to a pint of haricot beans over night ; next day put 
into a stewpan, or, better still, a fireproof marmiie^ 
31b. of lean brisket, a finely minced onion, a table- 
spoonful of moist sugar, the soaked beans, pepper, 
salt, and ground ginger to taste, and from three- 
quarters to a pint of w^ter, bring it all gently to the 



40 MEATS. 

boil, then stew it very slowly for four to five hours 
(the more gently this is cooked the better it will be ; 
almost any parts of the so-called "inferior" pieces 
of beef may be used thus); half an hour before 
serving skim it well, and add about a good table- 
spoonful of brown roux to the mixture, and when 
cooked serve very hot. 

Stewed hriaJcet of beef, — Choose a nice piece of 
not too fat brisket of any suitable weight, and 
remove all the bones, wipe and well flour the meat 
and then lay it flat on the board, dredging it well 
with guatre Spices or Gouffe's mixture, together 
with finely-minced herbs, using double the quantity 
of parsley to the other herbs. Now roll it up, tying it 
neatly into shape ; melt 3oz. or 4oz. of beef dripping, 
and brown the meat in this for twelve to fifteen 
minutes, turning it well, then pour off the fat ; add 
sufficient warm (not hot) bone stock to cover it, and 
the ordinary stock vegetables, a good bouquet of 
herbs, Ac, and simmer steadily for three or more 
hours, according to size. Thicken and flavour the 
well-skimmed liquor, and serve with its own vege- 
tables neatly dished. Brisket of beef may be used 
for this purpose without rolling, in fact, many 
persons prefer it ; it is boned by the removal of the 
flat bones, and fried for a few minutes in clarified 
dripping, covered with the stock, brought to the boil, 
well skimmed, the vegetables added, and finished 
off as above. Remember, however, that rolled beef 
takes double the usual time of cooking. Brisket of 
beef is often stewed in this fashion, and, when done, 
]b turned out into Qi flat-bottomed pan, its liauor

Baked Irish stew. — For this use either a plain 
round tin, or a proper '* hot-pot " dish ; brush the 
bottom over with a little clarified dripping, and 
place in the bottom a layer of sliced onion (mind 
this is as flat as may be), on this lay some beef 
steak cut into neat pieces about fin. thick ; then 
cover this with sliced potato, and repeat these 
layers (carefully seasoning each with salt and black 
pepper), till the dish is full, finishing with the 
potatoes, for which the top layer should be twice 
as thick as the other ones. Indeed, many cooks 
purposely use the three-cornered pieces left from 
slicing for the top ; pour in about half a gill of 
either stock, water, or water flavoured with a few 
drops of essence of anchovy, Worcester sauce, &c., 
as you please, and bake. For lib. of steak, which 
makes a nice dish for three or four persons, you 
will need three or four good onions, and three or 
four large potatoes (these must both be raw). 
This is really a form of hot-pot^ which is in many 
places a dish of great local celebrity, and is made 
with all sorts of ingredients, such as mutton chops 
or cutlets, kidneys, game, or poultry, cut up and 
seasoned to taste with spice, bacon, or ham, or 
tongue, &c. ; but the • process is the same in each 
case. 

Beef steak pudding. — Butter a pudding bowl and 
line it with some good suet crust, and cut some 
beef steak into neat pieces ; dip each into quatre 
epices and a very little flour, then fill up the basin 
with this steak, and pour in rather more than a gill 
of either bone stock or water, with a few di-ops of 



BEEF. 43 

essence of anchovy or Worcester sauce. Cut out a 
round of the suet crust and cover the pudding with 
it, moistening the edges and pressing them well 
together. Dip a pudding doth in boiling water, 
dredge it lightly with flour, then tie it over the basin ; 
put Hie latter into a saucepan of boiling water, and 
boil. This takes a considerable time, a pound of 
beef made into a pudding requiring at least two 
and a half hours. Meat puddings are amongst 
the things that can be varied almost indefinitely ; 
almost all meats can be cooked in this way. 
Some cooks add a little beef or 8hee2>'s kidney to their 
puddings, which undoubtedly adds both to the 
flavour and the gravy. Poultry, game, or rabbits 
cut up into small pieces, are excellent in puddings, 
but a thin slice of beef steak, well seasoned with 
pepper and salt, should always be placed at the 
]>ottom of the basin. Economical housekeepers may 
be glad to know that, not only is rump steak unne- 
cessary for this, but that the despised ** beef skirt " 
is preferable, as beef steak is only too apt to harden 
when boiled, whereas the beef skirt cooks well 
and gives out a generous portion of excellent 
gravy. Red-legged partridges mixed with cubes of 
salt or fresh pork and oysters, with the above-men- 
tioned beef skirt, make a delicious pudding. Failing 
the partridges, rabbits or veal may be used, but in 
this case mushrooms and a little finely-minced 
onions should always be added. There is a wonder- 
ful dish, well known in Fleet-street as the ** Cheshire 
Cheese pudding," which is a toothsome combina- 
tion of steak, mutton kidneys, oysters, mushrooms, 



44 MEATS. 

and larks (or, as some of the irreverent call them, 
London sparrows), cooked as above, only allowing 
rather longer for its cooking. 

A ^* snipe pie,** — A well-known dainty, which 
may be economically prepared with foreign game, 
the beef skirt (duly seasoned) lining the crust, and the 
whole birds, previously deprived of their heads, feet, 
and gall, being packed in with pepper, salt, and, if at 
hand, some mushrooms, together with a little stock 
or water. This pie, if made with three snipe, will 
take from two to two and a half hours' cookuig. 

Collared heef, — Mix together Joz. each of salt- 
petre and black pepper, 6oz. bay salt, and 2oz. 
common salt, with 4oz. or 6oz. of sugar (moist), and 
with this mixture rub the beef (about 61b. or 71b. of 
thin flank) and leave it in the mixture for fourteen 
to sixteen days, turning and rubbing it daily. Now 
rinse it quickly, remove the bones and the tough 
inner skin, sprinkle the inner side with minced 
parsley, thyme, bayleaf, and mushrooms (this is 
optional) ; roll it and tie it into shape, then tie it up 
in a clean cloth like a galantine, lay it in a pan just 
large enough to hold it comfortably, pour over it 
sufficient cold water or stock to cover it ; bring it to 
the boil, and let it simmer steadily and gently for 
three to four hours. If to be served hot, remove the 
cloth and serve with either tomato or brown sauce. 
If to be eaten cold, place the tied-up meat in a flat- 
bottomed dish, pour its liquor round it, cover with a 
weighted plate, and leave it till perfectly cold, when 
it can be freed from the cloth, the fat wiped off, and 
glazed with liquid glaze or aspic jelly, and served 



BEEf". 45 

cold for dinner or lunch. A little spice added to the 
pickle is by some considered an addition. Old- 
fashioned cooks used to lightly pickle a breast of 
veal in the same way as the beef, and then the latter 
was boned and seasoned, the similarly treated breast 
of veal laid on it, and the two rolled up together, 
finishing off as before. 

Boiled beef. — ^Take a nice piece of silverside or 
round, or even the aitchbone, after it has been salted 
for five or six days, wash it well, and, if very salt, 
soak for a few hours ; then place it in a pot suffi- 
ciently large to allow of its being thoroughly covered, 
and pour in sufficient boiling water to cover it well ; 
let it reboil sharply, then draw it to the side of the 
stove and let it simmer steadily for three hours or 
more (for apiece 101b. or so in weight), being careful 
to skim it well as it boils up, till no more rises, and 
not to let it boil again after the first boil up, but to 
keep it simmering only, or the meat will be hard and 
tasteless. Carrots and turnips are usually cooked 
with the meat, the former taking, if large, from one 
and a half to two hours' steady cooking, the latter 
forty-five minutes to one and a half hours, according 
to size and age. Suet dumplings, nicely cooked, are 
put in with the meat ten minutes before the latter is 
dished, and, like the vegetables, served with it. For 
the dumplings, shred very finely 2oz. of either suet 
or dripping and rub it into half a pound of flour, 
previously sifted with three-quarters of a teaspoonful 
of baking powder and one teaspoonful of salt, and 
work it to a stiff paste with tepid water ; then cut it 
into eight pieces, roll these into balls, lightly, on a 



4G MEATS. 

floured board, throw them into boiling water, and 
let them cook till thej rise to the surface of the 
water. Let these cook with the meat for the last 
ten minutes. 

Beef, if salted, takes about twenty minutes sim- 
mering to the pound after the initial boiling up and 
skimming (this takes from five to ten minutes), and 
from ten to fifteen minutes over ; but this, it must be 
carefully remembered, is counted from the boiling 
up and skimming, as said before. 

Ox heart, — This is frequently considered too coarse 
and greasy for a dainty menu ; but if carefully pre- 
pared it will be found very palatable. The great 
secret in its cooking is careful cleansing and stuffing, 
while, when served, the plates and dishes must be 
piping hot ; indeed, hot water dishes are best for this. 
Choose a heart that has hung three or four days, 
remove all the pipe and the blood, and soak it for 
an hour in warm water (some cooks even parboil it) ; 
then wipe it well, season with salt and coralline pepper, 
and fill it well with rather highly flavoured veal 
stuffing, sewing it up carefully. Now rub it all over 
with warm dripping, wrap it in a sheet of paper 
generously brushed with dripping, tie it up, and 
eithe rset it on the roasting tin in the oven, or hang it 
up, thick end uppermost, and roast in front of a clear 
fire. A fair-sized heart takes from three to three 
and a half hours to cook. Keep it plentifully basted 
whichever way you cook it, and when cooked 
remove the paper, and place on a very hot dish, with 
any rich sauce to taste, a garnish of cooked vege- 
tables, and currant jelly. 



BEEF. 47 

Remember, if roasted, the heart must be tied to 
the jack with string and never pierced with the hook. 
Heart is excellent hashed like hare (with which it 
may m an emergency be mixed with little or no 
fear of detection). Hearts, either ox or sheep, are 
delicious sliced and jugged precisely as you jug a 
hare with the same accompaniments. 

Boast tongue (an old Lincolnshire receipt). — 
Choose a nice plump, fresh tongue and rub it 
thoroughly with a pound of salt, letting it lie in the 
salt for five days ; after this, boil it steadily for two 
and a half hours. Then peel off the skin, brush 
the tongue well with beaten egg, crumb it generously, 
and roast or bake it for half an hour, browning it 
well, and keeping it carefully basted. Serve with 
rich brown gravy, or good brown sauce, to either of 
which you have added a gill of port wine and a 
good dash of cayenne. 

Pot roast. — Cut up some beef from the top of the 
shin or the leg of mutton piece into neat pieces, 
and pack these into an earthenware crock in alternate 
layers, with salt pork or bacon thinly sliced, sliced 
carrots, turnips, and onions, seasoning each layer 
with pepper, salt, powdered cloves, bayleaf, and 
minced thyme and parsley ; when the crock is about 
full pour in about a tumblerful of hard cider or vin 
ordinaire (or failing this two gills of sherry and 
water and half a gill of good vinegar), cover down 
tightly, luting down the lid with water paste to keep 
in the steam, and leave the crock thus prepared for 
five to six hours in a slow oven. When ready to 
serve, remove the lid and the paste, skim thoroughly,

and dish. Any part of beef can be used in this 
way, which is often in America made with oxcheek, 
after soaking it for six hours and removing the 
bones, &c. 

Ragout aux gniocchi a la romaine. — Cut into neat 
pieces about a pound of the leg of mutton piece (this 
part is the juiciest for this purpose) ; then chop up 
about 2oz. each of onion and fat bacon (this is a 
capital way of using up the fat end of a ham or a 
piece of pork), and fry these together till nearly 
cooked ; then add a good wineglassful of claret, and 
when this is all reduced to almost a glaze, put in about 
a pound of fresh tomatoes, or half a tin of the 
canned ones, half a pint of water, salt, black pepper, 
and the meat ; just bring it to the boil, and then let 
it stew very gently for an hour and a half. Mean- 
while take about half a teacupful of semolina 
and mix it with a little cold milk; then bring 
to the boil a short pint of milk, and, when 
boiling, stir the mixed semolina very gently 
into it, and let it boil, stirring all the time till it 
will come away clean from the sides of the pan ; now 
turn it out, and when cool lift it out in dessert- 
spoonfuls, and arrange a layer of these at the bottom 
of a pie dish, sprinkling these with grated Parmesan 
cheese, white pepper, and tiny morsels of butter or 
clarified dripping, and repeat these two layers till 
the dish is full ; then cover it with some of the 
gravy from the meat, and set it in the oven till quite 
hot; dish the meat neatly on a hot dish with its 
gravy, and serve the gniocchi separately. If care- 
fully made, this is a delicious ragout. 



BEEF. 49 

Pieces of the thick flank, or the veiny piece, or 
the leg of mutton piece, if carefully stewed as 
above, are excellent served whole with either the 
gniocchi or with macaroni alia romana or alia 
Milanese, or with rice pilau. Moreover, these dishes 
have the merit of being both succulent and 
uncommon. 



CHAPTEE in. 

VEAL. 

Veal is probably far better understood and utilised 
on the Continent than it is with us, where roast loin 
or fillet, stewed or boiled knuckle, cutlets, and veal 
pie appear pretty well to exhaust the list of available 
methods. These are all extremely good in their way, 
though somewhat wanting in variety, and certainly 
not using up the animal as fully as it might be. It 
must first be impressed on the cook that, like all 
white meat, veal requires to be thoroughly cooked, 
raw white meat being most unwholesome ; next it 
must be slowly cooked, for if hurried it loses all its 
delicacy. Twenty-five minutes to the pound and 
15min. over is the recognised allowance of time for 
roasting veal ; for boiling it should take longer, as 
properly speaking it should never, after the first boil 
up, be allowed to boil at all, but be kept gently 
simmering till thoroughly cooked. Lastly, when 
roasted the joint should be wrapped in a sheet of 
paper liberally spread with either butter or well 
clarified veal dripping, and must be basted with the 



VEAL. 51 

utmost liberality. Neglect of this point will utterly 
ruin veal. 

Directions for cutting up the veal either by the 
French or the English method have already been 
given ; but it may be observed that the four joints 
which so often appear on foreign menus are by no 
means so recondite as their unaccustomed names 
would lead one to fancy. The longe is practically the 
loin, extending from the " best end of the neck '* to 
within 4in. of the tail ; the quasi reaches right from 
the tail to the kidney ; the rouelle and the noix are 
really the same piece, and correspond in great measure 
with the English " chump end," the only difference 
bemg that if the chump end is cut lengthways it is 
known as the noix, whereas if divided crossways it 
becomes the rouelle. The fricandeau, so well known 
to travellers, and apparently so little known to the 
ordinary British cook, is, strictly speaking, a nice 
cut of the fillet, a part of the calf corresponding with 
the round of beef, the piece containing the " pope's 
eye " being the prime cut. But, failing this, any 
nice piece of veal which can be trimmed and tied, or 
skewered, into shape will really answer capitally, 
though if it is very lean it will need larding, i.e., 
strips of bacon rolled in mignonette pepper will have 
to be stitched either through, or on the surface of 
the meat, to give it the necessary fat. This is by no 
means so difficult a job as people fancy, and a little 
attention is all that is needed. Have a square block 
of either French larding bacon or the ordinary fat 
bacon (larding is an excellent way of using up the 
pieces of fat bacon often wasted in a house, as '' ao q\!^ 



52 MEATS. 

can eat that greasy stuff ! ") . Choose a larding needle, 
and, after slicing down the bacon from J^in. to Jin. 
thick, cut these slices into strips about 2iD. long, and 
as wide as they are deep, being careful to get them 
exactly to fit the needle, for if too large they will be 
pressed out in passing through the meat, whilst if too 
small the needle will have no hold on them. You 
then either pass these strips right through the meat, 
leaving the ends sticking out on each side, or you 
raise a welt of the meat between the finger and 
thumb, and sew the fat through this, allowing both 
the ends to come through on the surface. Of course, 
the appearance of the dish depends greatly on the 
evenness with which this is done, whichever plan be 
adopted. — Remember always to keep larding bacon 
in a cool place, if possible on ice, for some time 
before use, to ensure its firmness. — ^Another point 
well worth attention is that of the marinade. Veal 
is in itself a decidedly tasteless meat, and depends 
for its savour in great part on the adjuncts used in 
its preparation; and remember, the more highly 
flavoured the meat is when hot, the more toothsome 
will it be when cold. Veal is undoubtedly nourishing, 
and light of digestion, but savoury in itself it cer- 
tainly is not, as many an unlucky invalid condemned 
(as a treat too!) to a boiled knuckle of veal will 
mournfully testify. Tet try the said knuckle thus : 
Remove the bone, and replace it with some strips of 
bacon previously rolled in either quatre Spices or 
M. Gk)uffe's mignonette (for this pound together as 
finely as possible, and then sift, 4oz. each of dried 
thyme and bay leaf, 2oz. each of marjoram and 



VEAL. 53 

rosemary, and when this in all in a fine powder, fift 
into it 4oz. each of ground nutmeg, and red, Nepali or 
coralline pepper, 2oz. freshly ground black pepper, 
and a short |oz. of cayenne; when thoroughly 
blended store in tightly stoppered bottles ; this 
mixture, for use, is mixed with ordinary fine salt in 
the proportion of loz. of the mixture to 4oz. of salt, 
and makes a most delicious seasoning for all sorts (d 
stews, pies, galantines, &c,f as may be needed; ; now 
tie the leg back neatly into shape, and lard it Cfr not 
as you please. Let it stand for an hoor or so in 
vinegar, turning it two or three times during the 
time, then wipe it well, brush it orer with salad 
oil, and set it in a baking tin previously thickly lined 
with a few slices of beef or veal kidney, sliced onion 
and carrots, a shallot or two, some broken up 
parsley, a tablespoonful of well clarified dripping, a 
strip or two of well-scraped 1 aeon rind, and about a 
gill of stock. Bake it very gently, allowing fully two 
hours for a piece weighing from 41b. to 51b., and 
keep it thoroughly well basted. When perfectly 
cooked, take it up, remove the string, dish on a hfk 
dish, strain the gravy over and round it, and serve 
very hot. This is exceDent hot, but cold it is 
absolutely delicious. If preferred, the 1/^ or 
shoulder may be stewed thus: Bemove the lione, 
season the inside lightly with pepper and salt (or 
either of the two savoury peppers mentioned above), 
and skewer or tie it neatly back into shape, and lard 
it evenly with seasoned lardoons. llien for tiiu*h

veal dripping, and brown iVife "v^flX ^^^^^bi^"^ '

this over a clear but not too quick fire in the un- 
covered pan, till it is of a rich, even golden brown all 
over ; now add a little salt, pepper, and half a bay 
leaf (for a piece of, say, 31b.) Then pour in a table- 
spoonful or so of stock, or failing this of water, put 
the lid on the pan, weighting it down to keep in the 
steam, and leave it over a very gentle fire for two to 
three hours, according to the size of the meat. When 
cooked, lift it on to a hot dish, carefully skim the 
gravy, and pour it over the veal. It is then served as 
Veau au jus. This very homely dish can be varied 
in all sorts of ways. For instance, the piece of fillet 
containing the pope's eye may be chosen, cooked first 
in butter and then in good stock, to which a third 
part of sherry or red wine has been added, and 
when dished it may be sent to table with a puree of 
sorrel, spinach, or lettuce, as filet (or fricandeau) de 
veau a Voseille, aux epinardSy &c., according to the 
garnish : or failing these, broccoli tops or turnip tops 
prove an efficient substitute, if boiled in salted water, 
strained very dry, chopped extremely fine (or even 
sieved), and then heated with a little pepper, salt, 
and butter, or some of the gravy from the veal. 

As said above, any nice lean piece of veal can be 
used for these dishes, but if using the shoulder, 
when removing the bone leave a little of the meat on 
it, and the blade bone will then make a most excel- 
lent grill. 

Breast of Veal Stuffed and Stewed, — When the 
tendrons (i.e., the gristly pieces at the end of the 
bones at the thick end of the calf's breast, which 
are usually cut off and served as a specially delicate 



VEAL. 55 

entree) have been removed, bone tho broaitt, bat it 
out fiat, trim it neatly, seaHon it niculj with pepper, 
salt, and a very little spice to taiife (or nm either 
qtiatre Spices or mignonette), lay on thi«a ltty4»r of V0ry 
thin slices of fat bacon; have ready a roll of any 
delicate forcemeat, or even nice «an«a^<i meat, or 
plain veal herb farce ; plar;o thin roll at the end, and 
now roll up the meat, keeping it compact and doling 
in the ends as much as po^Mible ; Nknwer or tie it into 
shape, let it gently brown in a litih* btitt-er or 
clarified veal dripping, then add to it MtiHicient good, 
quite hot, stock not quite to cover it and the ordiriary 
braising vegetables (carrot, onion, turnip, herbu, 
&c., with a slice or two of umoked ham or ba<Jon), 
and let it stew gently till cooked (this nlowar thin in 
cooked the better) ; then lift it out, Mkim and Mligbtly 
reduce the gravy, brush it over this veal, and «erve th^ 
latter either plain or with any nice dreM»ed vegetabksM 
to taste. This dish can of course \)e mnda more or 
less rich according to this ingredients u«ed« It Im 
particularly good if stewed quite plainly, with 
only a thin layer of forcemisat inniumi of a roll, 
then when cooked it i» lifted out, well dralni^, 
thoroughly brushed over with good «alad oil, and 
rolled in freshly made fine breadcrumbiv nea^onM 
highly with pepper, salt, minc4*A chive«, and parsley, 
and quickly grilled over a clear fire. It in 
served very hot with sau^^ piquanUs, grill uaum, 
tomato, or any other sauce to taste, C Breast of

Breast of veal is more or lets ignored in England, 
but abroad it is treated a« a delicacy and ly^fytiA

with all sorts of savoury addenda. For instance, 
a breast of veal is so boned that the inner skin 
forms a kind of pocket, and in this is packed a 
mixture of asparagus points, artichoke bottoms, 
chopped spinach, onion, mushrooms, truffles, finely 
minced bacon, and a good cupful of breadcrumbs 
scalded in milk, squeezed dry, and then mixed with 
the rest, binding it all with the yolk of an egg and 
seasoning it highly. It is then skewered or tied into 
shape, an earthenware marmite, which will fit the 
oven and will just hold the meat and its adjuncts, 
is lined with bacon rind, sliced onions, mushrooms, 
&c. ; the meat is laid in and allowed to cook, closely 
covered, very slowly. This, of course, is a somewhat 
expensive dish, but it is very good, and makes an 
excellent piece de resistance out of a despised joint, 
which may come in handy on occasion. 

Bound of veal a la menagere. — Take a nice roimd 
from the top of the fillet, weighing about 61b., bone 
it and tie it neatly into shape ; melt a little butter 
or clarified dripping in an earthenware marmite or 
a stewpan that will fit the oven, lay in the veal and 
let it brown till of a nice golden colour, then moisten 
it with a quart of stock, add three whole carrots, 
two onions (each stuck with a couple of cloves), a 
good bouquet (thyme, parsley, green onion, lemon 
peel, bay leaf and a tiny blade of mace), with salt 
and pepper to taste. Bring it gently to the boil, 
then let it simmer slowly and steadily for about 
2^ hours, with the lid of the pan only half on, 
being careful to baste the meat frequently with its 
liquor. At the end of this time, lay in a buttered 



VEAL. 57 

paper, cover the pan down closely, set it in the oven 
with heat top and bottom, and let it simmer gently 
for half an hour longer, basting it four or five times 
during this half hour. When the veal is cooked 
(try it with the point of a trussing needle or a small 
skewer), lift it out and keep it hot; lift out the 
carrots, keeping them hot also, and strain the gravy ; 
skim it well, reduce by rapid boiling till all but a 
glaze, then dish the meat, garnishing it with the 
carrots cut into neat shapes and a dozen or so of 
small button onions stewed and glazed in butter, 
pour the reduced gravy over and serve. This veal 
is particularly good cold, if, when cooked, it is lifted 
into a basin, its strained gravy poured over and 
round it and left till next day, when it is turned out 
on to a dish and served. The gravy will be a firm 
jelly. If a piece of veal like this is larded with 
seasoned lardoons and browned in a pan with some 
sliced bacon, an onion, a carrot, and a head of celery, 
all sliced, together with a bay leaf and some branches 
of thyme ; then simmered very gently as before in 
one and a half pints of stock and half a pint of 
white wine (French) for three hours, and after 
skimming and reducing the gravy, it is served with 
its gravy on a bed of boiled macaroni, spaghetti, or 
ravioli, it is called a ritalienne, and makes a very 
pleasant change. This also is nice cold. 

Ragout of Veal a la Paysanne, — Melt 2oz. of 
butter or clarified dripping in a pan, lay in the neck, 
breast, and the trimmings of some veal cutlets, all 
cut up into pieces IJin. to 2in. by Sin., with a couple 
of bay leaves and some thyme ; toss this all over the 



58 MEATS. 

fire till nicely browned, then strew a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of flour over the meat, and stir it together 
over the fire for three or four minutes till the flour 
also is lightly browned; now add half a pint of 
stock and a gill of white wine (any light French wine 
is best), season to taste with salt and pepper, then 
cover down pretty closely, and let it simmer at the 
side of the stove for an hour, stirring it every ten 
minutes or so ; now pour in a pint of stock with 
three or four fresh tomatoes, skinned and quartered ; 
boil up sharply for fifteen minutes, then lift out the 
thyme and the bay leaves, put in some potatoes, peas, 
and mushrooms, all previously cooked separately in 
stock, mix these well into the stew over the fire till 
it boils up again, and serve. 

Boast Loin of Veal. — Take about 61b. or 61b. of loin 
of veal, including the kidney, remove the chine bone, 
and roll the flap over the kidney, tying it into place. 
Roast it for at least two hours before a moderate fire, 
basting it every ten or fifteen minutes, sprinkling it 
with a little ^e salt just five minutes before lifting 
the meat from the fire, place it on a hot dish, 
and pour over and round it the gravy previously 
skimmed and strained, and serve with seasoned 
watercress. 

Fricandeau. — Choose 2^1b. to 31b. of nice fillet of 
veal, lard it very closely right through (unless you 
have the pope's eye cut, when it only needs super- 
ficial larding), and tie it up into shape, keeping it as 
thick and round as you can. Line a stewpan with 
sliced carrot, add a moderate sized onion, stuck 
with two or three cloves, a good bouquet, some well

it need not be strong), with a few peppercorns, 
an onion or two chopped, a couple of cloves, and a 
bunch of herbs ; after it has cooked for about an 
hour and the meat is quite tender, lift out the 
latter, and use the liquor, of which there should be 
a quart, to cook the rice. Well wash l^lb. of good 
Patna rice in tepid water, then place it with the 
quart of stock in a closely-covered pan over a sharp 
fire ; bring it to the boil, and at this point add in 
a bay leaf and a tiny pinch of saffron, diluted with 
a little stock. Keep it boiling sharply till done in 
a tightly closed pan, then djsh as a well, and serve 
with the meat in a little of its own gravy in the 
centre. Or ; when the rice is cooked, toss the meat 
in a little butter or clarified dripping till nicely 
browned, then stir it and its gravy altogether on 
the dish and serve very hot. Or ; the meat is cut 
small and carefully fried in butter or ghee, allowing 
one onion and one mango (or three or four raisins) 
to each poimd of meat ; the pan is rubbed with a 
fresh-cut clove of garlic, and the meat is sprinkled 
with curry powder whilst it is cooking; it takes 
half an hour's steady cooking, and must be turned 
constantly during the process. The rice is cooked, 
as in the previous recipe, till three parts done ; it 
is then drained and finished off in butter till nicely 
coloured but not hard, seasoning it with lemon 
juice, spice, diluted saffron, &c., to taste. Remember 
a bay leaf should always be cooked with the rice 
(though it may be removed before serving), and 
fried onion rings, shred chillies, raisins stewed in 
Btocli, blanched almonds, <&c., can all be added to

pilaffs are equally pood made with fowls (osjHH*ially

Hotpci. — This is excellent made of veal, though 
it is a form seldom seen. For this wash and dry 
l^lb. of scrag of veal and cut it up into neat piooos ; 
also cut up about 4oz. of fat bacon or )>iokliHi pork 
into medium-sized dice. Have ready parboiled 21b. 
of potatoes and lib. scalded onions ; slice these 
rather thickly; prepare a flavouring mixture by 
well mixing a teaspoonful each of salt and finely 
minced parsley, half a teaspoonful of fn^shly ground 
pej^r (black), and a good pinch of ]>owdored 
thyme; now line a well-buttered hot-pot dish with 
potatoes, then put in the meat, and, histly, the 
onions, repeating these layers till the dish is full, 
finishing with the potatoes on top, ])our in half 
a pint of stock or water, cover the dish with an old 
plate and bake for one and a half hours ; then lift 
off the plate, put some little bits of butter over the 
top, and return it to the oven to brown for a little. 
Needless to say that for domestic purpost^s clarified 
dripping is quite as good as butter. 

The above recipes will give an idea of the many 
ways in which veal may be senred ; but, manifestly, 
in a book of this size it is impossible to give any- 
thing like an exhaustive list. To show how great 
the variety may be it may be mentioned tl a' all 
the following garnishes suit fricaiideau, roast or 
stewed loin (or longe), «fec. : 

a la Bruxellaise, i.e., with delicately boiled Brussels 
sprouts, tiny sausages, and bechamel sauce. 



62 MEATS. 

a la CambacereSf i.e., sliced tongue and truffles 
cooked in wine, and a good white Italian sauce. 

a la GMjpolata, i.e., tiny smoked Chipolata sausages, 
broiled mushrooms, rolls of fried bacon, stewed chest- 
nuts, all tossed in a rich and rather highly flavoured, 
brown gravy. The meat for this should properly be 
braised, and, if liked, tomato sauce may be used. 
(Most fine poultry is good garnished thus.) 

a la Cremieref i.e., with poached eggs and a very 
creamy rich bechamel sauce. 

a la Fermiere. — For this the veal should be braised 
without previous frying, and be kept as white as 
possible ; it is then served either with a poulette or 
paacaliiie sauce, and a garnish of peas and small 
sprays of cauliflower. 

a la Jardiniere^ i.e., served with a piece of good 
boiled bacon and a good jardiniere garnish (all 
kinds of nice young vegetables cut into shapes, 
separately cooked and glazed in stock and butter.) 

a la Princesse, i.e., rolled, stuffed with a rich 
forcemeat, flavoured with ham, mushrooms braised, 
or roasted and served with sliced tongue or ham 
and a very creamy veloute sauce. 

d la Lomharde, — Serve braised, with a sauce made 
of two parts allemande and one part rich tomato 
sauce, with a garnish of fried croutons spread 
alternately with anchovy and ham butter. 

a la Mancelle, — Braised and served with a demi- 
glace, and a garnish of stewed chestnuts. 

a la 8te. Claire, — Eoasted or cooked in papillote, 
and served with fried ham and tomato sauce.

Cooked in this way calf's head may be served with 
tomato or other sauce to tast-e, and when cold is good 
if cut into neat pieces, and served either en vinaigrette 
(i.e., a plain French oil and vinegar dressing), or 
with any form of mayonnaise or tartare sauce. 
Abroad, however, the calf's head is cooked somewhat 
differently, and if to be served subsequently en tortiie, 
it is well to follow the Continental directions. For 
this see that the head is well scraped, washed, <fcc., 
then tie it up in thin muslin and soak it for half an 
hour in boiling water, which must be kept hot all the 
time. Then drain the head, rinse it in fresh cold 
water, and wipe it carefully in a very clean soft cloth. 
Now place sufficient fat or dripping (of course 
properly clarified, and preferably veal dripping) in a 
pan — large enough to hold the head, <fcc., comfortably 
— to well cover the bottom of the pan when melted, 
and stir to this four good tablespoonf uls of flour and 
a small sliced onion ; pour to this from three to 
four pints of water, add three sliced carrots, and one 
onion stuck with three or four cloves, some pepper- 
corns, salt to taste, and a bouquet garni as im 
the previous recipe. Lastly add a teaspoonful 
of vinegar, bring the whole to the boil, lay in the 
head, let it re-boil, then cover down closely and let it 
simmer steadily for two and a half to three hours. 
Allow it to get thoroughly cold before cutting it up 
for tete de veau en tortue, &c. The calf's head en 
tortue is simply a rich hash, a brown roux being 
prepared in which a sliced and minced onion or two 
have been fried ; dilute this with stock sufficient to 



tnake the needed grayj, let ii boil up, then add a 
gill or so of wine (Marsala or sherry is best), a little 
^laze, and a good dust of cayenne or preferably, 
coralline pepper ; let it boil up sharply, then lay in 
the calf*8 head cut into neat pieces, and well 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and let it all stew 
gently together till the meat is quite hot and the 
gravy thick. Add a squeeze of lemon juice, and if 
necessary a little cayenne, and serve. 

Calf 8 Head Braised, — For this prejiare and bone 
the head as in the first recij^e, and lay it flat on the 
table. Have ready a rich forcemeat of minced and 
pounded veal, ham, <&c., to which you have added the 
contents of a small jar of pate defoie gras. Season 
with mignonette, and bind with one or more egg 
yolks ; make this into a roll and place it on the calFs 
head, rolling this latter up and carefully sewing it 
up to cover the stuffing well. Tie it into sha()e in a 
clean cloth, and place it in a convenient-sized pan 
previously lined with a slice of veal, some ham or 
bacon trimmings, some sliced carrots, spice, and a 
good bunch of herbs ; moisten it all with a good 
glass of wine and half a pint of stock, bring it gently 
to the boil, then let it simmer slowly and gently for 
four hours ; lift the head (after well draining it, and 
removing the cloth, string, <&c.) on to a hot dish ; 
add a glass of Madeira or sherry to the sauce, after 
straining and well skimming the latter, and let it 
boil up sharply to reduce it a little, season rather 
highly with lemon juice, coralline pepper, &c., pour 
it over and round the head, and serve with a crood 
financiere garnish. 



CHAPTER IV. 

MUTTON. 

Somewhat lias been already said concerning the 
choosing and cuttij:\g up of mutton, and also the age 
at which it is most delicate for the table, though, 
alas ! the five-year-old wether, so dear to the epicure, 
is fast becoming an unknown quantity in the land, 
as economic reasons forbid its being left so long 
unprofitable. A point to be considered when choos- 
ing mutton is with regard to the locale in which it 
has been fed. Undoubtedly, the finest is that which 
has grown up on the chalky sea-blown downs of 
southern England, the moor pasturage of Devon- 
shire, or the rocky herb-covered hills and valleys of 
Scotland and Wales. In the salt marshes of tJie 
Eastern counties again, there is much local ap- 
preciation of the Romney marsh mutton, which, 
though large, possesses, from the salty nature of its 
pasturage, the flavour which has made the famous 
French pre sale mutton the rival of our own incom- 
parable Southdown. All these kinds, however, are 
decidedly deficient in fat, a deficiency that often 
troubles the unlearned housekeeper, who complains 



"N: 



Mtn?T?ON. «? 

of the ** dryness " of the moor-fed mutton, as com- 
pared with the fat of the larger sheep grown in 
lusher, even ranker pasture. But all connoisseurs 
know the superiority of the smaller, more delicately 
fed animals, as compared with the larger and coarser 
mland sheep. 

The length of time mutton will hang is a great 
deal a question of temperature and convenience. 
Granted a well- ventilated larder and dry weather a 
leg may hang with perfect safety for four or five 
weeks, and even pfirFiaps longer. But if the larder 
is insufficiently airy, or damy», muggy w^mther sets 
in, the same joint will hardly kwp in (^m(Vii'um for a 
quarter of the time. Anyway, meat hung n;quires 
constant hxiking aft«*r and aiUmi'um. The loin, 
esjiecially the kidney end, and the underpart of the 
shoulder are parts that need s(>ecial att<.'ntion. 
Some cooks sprinkle the meat tliat is to hang with 
freshly ground \Mt\)in;Y and powdered charcoal, whilst 
others again trust, and not uselessly, to the preser- 
vative powers of salt, or the efficiency of a pinch or 
so of ground ginger, mix^xl with the j^epi^er. It may 
be well here to mention an old world practiiM*, which, 
though <njt iff datij j^erhaj/s tumiuhiyH^ is none the u 
effective. Many have mam ilus fin; tree» that i 10

its appearance on the table a credit to the house- 
keeper. So a joint was prc^iptlj stitched or tied up 
in a piece of coarse muslin, and the whole was then 
nestled in amongst the fig tree branches, and left 
for a few hours, when on being taken down it was 
found to be in good cooking order. I am not 
sufficiently scientific to explain this process, but its 
success is undoubted. 

The remarks anent roasting beef apply equally 
cogently to mutton, which, like all brown meat, 
does not need to be so thoroughly cooked as does 
white meat ; though, of course, the time bestowed 
on it must be a matter of personal taste, as some 
people are almost cannibals in the matter of under- 
done meat, whilst others again prefer something 
between a cinder and shoe leather. According to 
M. Gouffc, a leg of mutton duly roasted should 
take, for say a 71b. joint, one and a half hours ; a 
leg of mutton of about 61b. will need about one 
hour and twenty minutes; whilst 31b. of loin of 
mutton will take about thirty-five minutes. English 
cooks say fifteen minutes per pound, and fifteen 
minutes over for thin pieces, or twenty minutes per 
pound, and from fifteen to twenty minutes over for 
thick joints, such as legs of mutton, &c. Baking 
takes about as long; but remember in this case 
constant and generous basting is indispensable, if 
the meat is not to diy up to a stick. The best way 
with any fat or thick joint is to brush a paper over 
pretty thickly with warm fat or dripping, and then 
to fold it round and over the joint after the latter 
has received its first preliminary basting with hot 



fat. Hie joint is them liaslied or€r tke paper, tke 
latter being taluen <M snficaeiidT k«ig be^ote tite joint 
is read J, to allov oi tiie laoter being nic^elj bnyvmed 
and crisped hfdot^ the Are. If the paper is kft en 
too long it will gire a gi^easj taste to the meat. 
To roast a joint of lautuai, melt some dripping 
caref ullj in the dripping pan. and as soon as the 
meat is put <lown laste it plientifallT with this; 
let it cook sharply rather dose to the fiie, then 
draw it a Uttle further off and let it cook more 
slowly and solidly, to ensure the thorough cooking 
of the thidc part. Baste often; this cannot be 
done too frequently. If flour is used to froth up 
the meat, as advised in some cookery books, mind 
it is dredged on sufficiently long before the joint 
is done to ensure the flour being thoroughly cooked, 
for the raw, harsh taste of uncooked flour found with 
carelesslv cooked meat, is most nauseous. CPersonallv 
I prefer my roast meat unfloured.) When ready 
the meat should be of a rich, golden browu. As 
regards the gravy, pour off the fat from the dripping 
pan very carefully, and then add either sufficient 
boiling water or stock (the shank bone of the leg, 
which should always be removed before roasting, 
will provide plenty of this), stirring it well round 
the pan, and being specially careful to incorporate 
in the liquid all the little blisters of crisp brown 
that will be found adhering to the pan ; then when 
it has all dissolved and the liquid is of a uniform 
brown tint, salt it lightly and reheat, pouring a 
little over the joint and sending up the rest in a 
ijifeU-SQS^ded tureen. Even the ielly, wk<e.t\i«x V^s^^

or red currant, or rowan jelly, sent to table with 
mutton, is considered by connoisseurs improved by 
being sligbtly warmed (not melted) ; as mutton 
cools so quickly, anything tending to chill it is to 
be deprecated. Moreover, heating does not spoil 
the flavour of either jelly. When roasting be 
careful of draughts, which interfere with the proper 
cooking of the joint (hence the screen always seen 
with a jack), and see that the fire is kept to a 
steady heat with a bright glowing surface towards 
the meat. If it must be made up during the 
process, draw the hot part forward and put in the 
fresh fuel at the back N.B. — Meat takes a trifle 
longer to cook in cold weather. 

The above remarks apply to all joints, so no 
further directions for roasting or baking need be 
given, save to repeat as regards the latter, the im- 
perative necessity of plentiful and constant basting. 

As so often people complain of the difficulty in 
small families of using up a leg of mutton without 
exposing oneself to a course of " cold mutton again ! " 
the first recipe shall be one for the treatment of a 
leg by which three fresh " joints " may be obtained 
from the same leg. 

Out the leg neatly into three parts, consisting of 
the top, which will form a nice fillet ; a thick steak 
(the " pope's eye steak ") from the centre ; and 
lastly the knuckle. The latter may be delicately 
boiled or steamed, and served with caper sauce ; or 
it may be cooked au jus, a particularly succulent 
method of preparing it. For this dust the cut part 
lightly with flour, season it to taste with pepper 



MUTTON. 71 

and a little salt, and lay it in a pot that will just 
hold it comfortably, with three moderate onions, 
one stuck with a clove or two ; close the pan down 
very closely, and let it all cook at the side of the 
stove very slowly for two to two and a half hours 
till the meat is perfectly tender, and the gravy is 
rich. Another way of doing the knuckle is to 
season it well, and inclose it in «uet cinist like a 
pudding, adding a sliced onion or two, and one or 
two kidneys to it if liked, and then boiling or 
steaming it precisely as if it were a meat pudding. 

The steak is perhaps nicest if grilled or broiled, 
though it may be stewed or braised if preferred. 
If broiled, serve it with either a ivtit of any savoury 
butter under and upon it, or with brown oyster or 
shrimp sauce, and a garnish of broiled mushrooms, 
baked tomatoes, or fried potato straws or ribbons, 
as you please. Where two steaks are available, one 
steak is seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper with 
a very little grated lemon peel, a rich oyster force- 
meat (or any rich forcemeat to taste) is spread 
about an inch thick, the other steak, previously 
seasoned, is next laid on the first, sandwich fashion ; 
they are then brushed over with oiled butter or salad 
oil, and broiled or toasted in a Dutch oven for about 
thirty minutes or so, according to their thickness. 
Serve with good gravy, to which you have added the 
oyster liquor, a drop or two of essence of anchovy, a 
tiny squeeze of lemon juice, and salt and pepper to 
taste. 

Bone the top part of the leg and fill this cavity 
with any good forcepieat to taste \ tie the joint up 



72 MEATS. 

in a buttered paper, and roast it, keeping it well 
basted. Serve with its own grayy, and a garnish of 
fried tomatoes, mushrooms, &c., to taste. Another 
plan is to lard the top sido neatly, and then: to lay it 
for eight to twelve hours in a marinade made of 
onions, thyme, parsley, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaf, 
and where the flavour is not disliked, a clove of 
garlic, all boiled up together in a little water and 
vinegar, and used warm. When ready lift it out, 
drain it a little, then roast it, keeping it well basted 
with the marinade. Dish on a hot dish, with some 
good brown sauce to which you have added a little 
of the strained marinade. 

Koast leg of mutton may be served with a 
variety of garnishes ; for instance, with a rich 
puree of onion, either white or brown (d la Souhise), 
or with stewed haricot beans {a. la Bretonne), 
first soaked for ten or twelve hours, then slowly 
boiled in cold fresh water, allowing them only 
to si«amer after the first boil up ; when soft they are 
stirred either into a little brown sauce or mixed with 
a very smooth brown onion puree or sauce. Stewed 
chestnuts or broiled mushrooms, artichoke bottoms, 
tomatoes, <&c., may all be used as garnish. Needless 
to observe that other joints of roast mutton can be 
served with the same garnishes. Then again a leg 
of mutton is delicious braised, or it mav be boiled 
and served with various sauces. 

Leg of MrUton mth Parmesan and Cauliflower, —

all sliced, with a good bunch of herbs ; lay the 
meat on this, cover it all with a buttered paper, and 
fry it all for fifteen or twenty minutes over a 
moderate fire. Now add a gill of claret and half 
a gill of mushroom ketchup or sherry, and let it 
simmer gently till the liquid is nearly absorbed, 
then pour in at the side half a pint of good brown 
gravy or stock, cover the pan and set it in the oven 
for two and a half hours. Be careful to keep it 
well basted all the time, adding a little more stock 
as that in the pan reduces. When ready remove 
the strings and skewers, brush the leg over with 
warm glaze, and serve on a hot dish with its own 
gravy, strained and well skimmed, round it. Any 
good rich sauce may be sent to table in a sauce-boat 
with it, according to the garnish used. 

Leg of Mutton stuffed ivith Oysters. — For this it is 
well to choose a nicely hung leg of Welsh mutton. 
Prepare a forcemeat with twelve or fourteen bearded 
oysters (stew the beards to extract all possible 
liquor) minced not too finely, 4oz. or 6oz. of 
freshly grated white breadcrumbs, a piece of finely 
grated lemon rind (do not overdo this), a tea- 
spoonful of minced parsley, white pepper, salt, 
and a very little cayenne to taste, a grate of nut- 
meg, an anchovy (washed, boned, and minced) or 
a little essence of anchovies, the hard-boiled yolk 
of an e^^, a small, finely minced onion, 3oz. to 4oz. 
of finely minced suet (veal suet is the best), the 
yolk of an egg, and sufficient of the oyster liquor 
and that obtained from the oyster beards to make 
the farce into a nice mass. Insert this uuder the 



MUTTON. 75 

skin of tho leg in the thickest part, under the flap, 
and at the knuckle, then roast it, keeping it well 
basted. Serve very hot with brown oyster sauce 
flavoured with a little essence of anchovy. 

Leg of Mutton a la Busse. — Choose a good, well- 
hung leg and three parts roast it, then place it on a 
fireproof dish, pour two good glassfuls of brandy 
or eau de vie over it, and set it over a slow fire till 
the brandy is quite warm ; now set the spirit alight, 
keeping it well stirred as long as it will burn, by 
turning and returning the joint in it. Then add 
to the meat a little good gravy ; let this heat, remove 
all fat, and serve very hot. 

a la polonaise. — Braise a well - hung 

small leg till three parts cooked, then drain it well 
and slice it down into large slices without, however, 
separating these from the bone; have ready mixed 
some minced parsley, chives, shallot, powdered 
ginger, freshly ground black pepper, salt, finely 
grated white breadcrumbs, and fresh butter, and 
spread each slice of meat with this mixture, press 
it all back into shape, and put it into a pan that 
will just hold it, moistening it with a little of its 
own liquor and a glass of champagne. Close down 
the pan closely, and let it cook for half an hour 
with heat above and beneath, then skim off any fat 
there may be, squeeze the juice of an orange over 
it all and serve very hot. 

a la Durand. — Bone a well-hung small 

leg of mutton and season the inside with small 
strips of ham, fillets of anchovy, minced parsley, a 
little powdered bay leaf, minced shallot, and if at 



76 MEATS. 

Imnd sliced truffles, seasoning this all well with 
quatre epices; now tie it back neatly into shape, 
and place it in a pan, previously lined with 3oz. 
or 4oz. of clarified dripping, an onion or two, one 
or two tomatoes, a carrot, and a little celery, all 
sliced, a good bouquet, and a few mushrooms ; 
cover with a sheet of buttered paper, fit down the 
lid of the pan, and let its contents fry till nicely 
graline at the bottom of the pan (i.e., from fifteen 
to twenty minutes), then add a good gill of claret 
or Burgundy, and a wineglassful of eau de vie, 
and when iJiis has been well reduced by gentle 
simmering, pour in half a pint of good brown stock, 
and set the pan, closely covered, in the oven for two 
to two and a half hours, keeping it well basted all 
the time, and adding more stock as that in the pan 
reduces. When cooked, lift out the leg, bi-ush it 
over with just liquid glaze, allow the liquor in the 
pan to cool a little, then skim off the fat, add to it 
about half a pint of good brown sauce or espagnole, 
as you please, let it boil up, then strain some over 
and round the joint, and send up the rest in a 
saiiceboat. Garnish the leg with a hot financiere 
garnish, some button mushrooms, sliced tniffles, 
and either prawns or crayfish. This is a somewhat 
expensive if excellent dish, but it need hardly be 
said that the same kind of dish may be evolved by 
using less expensive materials, leaving out the 
trufftes, financiere, &c., or replacmg them with 
broiled mushrooms, turned and stewed olives, and 
some good shrimp sauce, only iu this c^^ do noi 
call it gigot a 2a JPurani,

Shoulder of Mutton Broiled. — Lard a shoulder of 
mutton neatly with good streaky bacon, and braise 
it with the same addenda as a leg till all but cooked ; 
now strew it thickly with seasoned breadcrumbs, 
to which you have addtMl a little Parmesan cheese 
and some finely minced sweet herbs, and broil it 
oyer a clear fire, moistening it now and again with 
a little of the braising liquor. 

toith Queen Mary's Hatice. — Three ]>arts 

roast a nice, well-hung shoulder of mutton, then 
put into the roasting tin under it a soup plate with 
three tables{x>onfuls each of hot water and port 
wine, a shallot and an anchovy, both finely minced, 
and a little pepper; finish roasting the mutton, keep- 
ing it well basted with the contents of the soup plute. 
When cooked, turn up the inner side of the joint, 
score it across and across with a sharp knife, and 
strew it thickly with fried breadcrumbs, pouring the 
rest of the gravy over it. Cooked in this way 
shoulder of mutton is very good, served with well 
made Yorkshire pudding ; or it can be plainly roasted 
with the pudding under it, and then be sent to table 
with a good horseradish cream in a sauce-boat. Or 
the remains (especially if it was originally under- 
done) make a very nice broil thus : Score the meat 
with a sharp knife right down to the bone, then 
season highly with cayenne, French or English made 
mustard, and a very little grated lemon peel ; dip it 
in oil or warm butter, then roll it in, or strew it 
thickly with breadcrumbs, broil over a clear fire, and 
send to table very hot, either with or without a hot 
grill sauce.

Stuffed Loin of Mutton, — Bone a nice well-hung 
loin, lay it flat on a board, remove all unnecessary 
fat, and spread it with a good layer of well-made veal 
stuffing, to which you have added either a minced 
anchovy or two, or some essence of anchovy ; now 
roll up the loin neatly, tying it into shape with broad 
tapes, brush it all over with liquefied butter, and 
roast or bake it for one and a haK to two hours 
according to size ; it is then taken up, freed from the 
tapes, and brushed over with liquid glaze ; it can be 
served plain with its own gravy or with espagnole, or 
brown caper sauce as you please, or it may be placed 
on a nice puree of any good vegetables (minced and 
sieved turnip tops, re- heated in a little gravy and 
butter are particularly good), to taste, and serve with 
any sauce you like. It is alco good a la Milanaise, 
if served with cooked macaroni or spaghetti, mixed 
with grated cheese, and good tomato sauce. It may 
be observed that a very delicate fricandeau can be 
made by lifting the whole fillet off the bones of a 
loin; line a suitable stewpan with 3oz. or 4oz. of 
clarified dripping, a slice or two of beef, or veal and 
ham, or any trimmings of these, with a carrot or 
two, an onion sliced, and a good boucjuet ; lay 
the fricandeau on this, cover with a buttered paper, 
and let it fry gently for twelve to fifteen miuutos; 
then add some good stock and allow it to braise 
very slowly till jxirfectly done, when you drain and 
skin the fricandeau, glaze it, and serve on any nice 
puree of endive, spinach, sorrel, mushrooms, &c. 

Breast of Mutton. — This is a part of the sheep that 
18 usually despised, but with a. little care it produces 



MuTTOlf. 79 

lUost excellent dishes. For instance, any rociije 
given for the loin is equally good, if a nice whole 
breast of mutton he used for the purpose. It can 
also be made into a very fair galantine, using a 
sausage meat forcemeat, with strips of ham, tongue, 
anchovy fillets, almonds, blanched and slin.'d, olives, 
^., according to what is at hand. It is then rolled 
up, tied into shape, fastened up in a clean jjiece of 
muslin, and braised with vegetables, herbs, beef 
and veal trimmings, &c., in the usual way ; then 
when cooked it is pressed till j>erfectly cold, 
when it is freed from fat and glazed, either 
with aspic jelly, or with a good brown sauce, 
stiffened with gelatine in the proportion of half an 
ounce to the half -pint of gravy (or, i)erhai)s, a little 
less, according to the stiffness desired). To many 
people this would be preferable to the aspic, which 
gives an acid taste not always liked. Breast of 
mutton treated in this way is also good if served 
hot with good brown gravy or sauce, or any nice 
vegetable puree. It were much to be desired that 
British cooks should realise the advantage of nice 
vegetable purees in eking out and improving the 
appearance of a dish. Where economy has to be 
considered, a puree will l)e found of great assistance, 
whilst macaroni again, which, it must be remem- 
bered, is decidedly nutritious, is far too much 
neglected. The pity is that many enthusiasts, whilst 
dwelling quite wisely on the nourishing qualities 
of pulse of various kinds — macaroni, rice, &c. — 
forget that their flavour, if served in the severely 
simple style — which is the first, unassisted idea of 



80 MfiATS. 

the ordinary " good plain cook " — leaves a good deal 
to be desired by the average mortal, who naturally 
prefers something more savoury. Perhaps the two 
following recipes may serve to ex])lain my meaning. 
Ban. — ^This is Neapolitan for ragout or stew, and 
is mostly in Naples made with a piece of beef ; but 
breast, shoulder, or loin of mutton is quite as nice, 
really. Bone the breast, say, removing all unneces- 
sary fat, and dust the inside with freshly ground 
black pepper and minced or powdered sweet herbs 
(parsley, thyme, marjoram, &c.)i then lay on this 
a strip of bacon, both fat and lean, a'so rolled iu 
pepper and sweet herbs, and tie np the meat into 
a neat roll. Now prepare a forcemeat by mincing 
pretty finely a good piece of bacon (if this chance 
to be too lean add to it a little of the superfluous 
mutton fat), with onion, sweet herbs, and, if liked, 
a little garlic (remember that if you wish to obtain 
the flavour without the strength of garlic you should 
peel, but never cut, the clove, or the juice exuding 
will flavour everything hopelessly) ; when this is 
thoroughly blended put it into a saucepan in 
a smooth layer, and on it place the roll of meat, 
turning it till it is nicely browned all over. Now 
season it with pepper and salt to taste, and add to 
it some tomato puree diluted with water or stock 
till of the consistency of thin pea soup; just 
bring it to the boil, then allow it to simmer very 
slowly for three or four hours according to the size 
and thickness of the meat. When cooked, lift the 
meat out, strain off the sauce, and use three-quarters 
of it to moisten some ready cooked macaroni, 



MUTTOK. 81 

previously well dusted with pepper, salt, and grated 
cheese, turning the macaroni well over and over to 
get it thoroughly saturated with the liquor : then 
place a thick bed of this on a hot dish, the meat on 
it, and lastly pour the reserved quarter of the meat 
liquor over the whole and send to table very hot. This 
meat is excellent hot, and, if possible, nicer cold. 
Remember in this as in every case the macaroni 
must be properly cooked. Boiled macaroni, — For 
this have ready a large pot of boiling salted 
water, throw the macaroni in whilst it is at the 
full boil, and keep it boiling fast all the time, 
stirring it now and again. Am soon as on lifting 
a small piece and biting it yon find the pipe is 
crisp yet tender, dash in half a pint of icy cold 
water to throw it ofE the boil at once, and drain 
off the macaroni carefully. It is then ready 
for use, though it is not so pappy as macaroni 
cooked a VAnglaise is apt to be, when for a 
Neapolitan it would be utterly ruined by over- 
cooking. Macaroni cooked thus and then tossed 
in any nice gravy or sauce, or mixed with hot butter 
and seasoned, is a capital accompaniment to many 
kinds of meat. Be sure it is cooked in plenty of 
water. Almost every kind of macaroni takes a 
special time to cook, which must be learned by 
experience, though in general from twenty to thirty 
minutes is allowed. For the tomaio purSe, stalk 
and quarter some good tomatoes, and boil them in 
a little water well seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
a bunch of herbs (parsley, bay leaf, and a good 
spray of fresh or dried basil) and when thoroushly 

o 



u

done pour them all on to a sieve to drain perfectly. 
Throw away the water that flows from them, 
and then press the tomatoes through the sieve, 
after which the pulp is heated with a piece of 
butter or well clarified dripping and stirred into the 
macaroni. When used for the ran, this pur^e is 
diluted with water to the desired consistency. 

Mutton Stew a la Bomaine. — Cut up about a 
pound of mutton (say a piece of the leg ; if you 
use the neck or breast a little more must be allowed 
on account of the bones) into neat pieces, rather 
more than 2in. long by lin. wide ; then lay in a 
stewpan about 2oz. of minced onion and the same 
of minced fat bacon, and fry lightly ; when almost 
cooked add a wineglassful of any red wine, and let 
it all cook till nearly a glaze, when you add three 
or four tomatoes peeled and quartered (or if handier 
take half a tin of canned tomato), half aDpint of 
water, salt and pepper ; then add the meat, and let 
it all cook together very gently for one and a half 
hours, when you serve it with gniocchi alia romana. 
For these make a thick porridge with fine semolina, 
exactly as you would with oatmeal, and when 
thoroughly cooked turn it out on a slab to get cold. 
Now have ready a buttered piedish, and lay a series 
of spoonfuls of semolina porridge neatly at the 
bottom ; then on this strew a layer of grated (;heeso, 
some morsels of butter, and, if liked, a spoonful of 
the gravy from the meat; repeat these two layers 
till the dish is full, when you pour over it rather 
more of the liquor and set it in the oven till 
thoroughly hot. Dish the meat with the rest of 



MUTTON. 83 ^^ 

the gravy roimd and over it, and send the gniocchi 
to table with it. These are excellent, though perhaps 
not quite so delicate, if made with Indian commeal. 
This same porridge or polenta^ to give it its proper 
name may also when cold be cut into dice or 
lozenges, fried in hot fat or oil, and served either 
with tomato or mushroom pur^e as a dish by itself > 
or as an accompaniment to any joint. It is par- 
ticularly good with mutton. 

I^varin of^MvMon. — This is in reality a form of 
haricot mutton. It is made thus: Choose a nice 
and not too fat piece of mutton from the neck, 
breast, or shoulder, and cut this up into neat, thick 
pieces. Toss these over the fire in a little well 
clarified dripping or butter till delicately browned, 
then strew in about a dessertspoonful of flour and 
stir this well in, shaking the pan till the flour abo 
is cooked and of a rich dark brown. Then pour 
in half a pint of hot water (some people use stock, 
but hot water is really excellent), add a good bouquet, 
a seasoning of pepper and salt, and a tiny clove of 
j)eeled, bilt not cut, garlic (do not betray the 
presence of this), cover down the pan and let it all 
cook gently. Meanwhile, have ready some turnips, 
l.)eeled and quartered in the same way as you 
cut up apples for a tart, and fry these quarters in 
another pan with a little butter and a tiny piece of 
sugar, till of a golden brown; when coloured, lift 
them out with a slice and add them gently to the 
meat and let it all simmer together for an hour. 
Now lift the meat on to a very hot dish, arrange the 
turnips round it, free the gravy as much as possible 

a 2 



84 MEATS. 

from grease, and strain it through a colander orer 
the meat, <&c. Mind the colander is scalded out 
before pouring the gravy through it, or it will chill 
the latter. 

If, instead of turnips, some well-soaked and par- 
boiled red (dried) beans be added to the meat, 
cooked as above, in the place of tomatoes, the dish 
results in what may be called Haricot a la Cyrano 
de Bergerac, as it is one mentioned with approval 
by that now popular comic writer of the seventeenth 
century. For an ordinary, but most excellent 
JTaricot, fry the mutton as above with the addition 
of two or three medium- sized onions for each pound 
of meat, and, at the last, add in some carrots rather 
thickly sliced, or quartered potatoes (these last are 
optional), and let them finish as above. The 
difference between a Navarin and a Haricot is that 
almost any vegetables may be used for the latter, 
whereas the former, strictly speaking, only admits 
of turnips. 

Hotpot of Mutton, — This dish varies in material 
and also in quality in almost every house. The 
ordinary form consists of mutton cut into neat 
pieces, nicely seasoned with salt and pepper, sliced 
onion and potato, arranged in layers in a * hotpot ' 
dish or tin — onions first, then the meat, and lastly 
the potatoes, finishing with the latter, which should 
be cut rather thicker for the top layer. Each layer 
is seasoned as it is put in, a little water, dashed with 
mushroom or walnut ketchup is poured in, and the 
whole is then baked for two hours or so according to 
the size of the dish. This is also excellent made of 



MUTTON. 85 

beef. Then there ia a refined kind made with eutlota 
from the best end of the neck or loin, carefully 
arranged with layers of sliced mutton kidneys, raw 
bearded oysters, and sliced parboiled potato, the whole 
being seasoned with salt, popp t, coralline pepper, 
minced parsley, and finely chopped chives or shallot. 
This is finished ofE precisely as in the former case. 
The famous "Lancashire hotpot" is made thus, though 
with slight variations. The cutlets are trimmed, 
seasoned, and laid in first into the lightly buttered 
" pot," then a good layer of seasoned sliced kidneys, 
very thinly sliced onion, bearded oysters, and sliced, 
parboiled potatoes, sprinkling this layer with a small 
toaspoonful of curry powder (this is a matter of 
taste), and repeat these layers, finishing with potato, 
which, however for this should be only halved, than 
add the oyster liquor, and a litthi good gravy, and 
bake it all in not too fierce an ovtui, till the top lay(»r 
of potatoes is cooked and nicely browned. Add a 
little more hot gravy before serving. In every cose 
these hotpots are improved by being stood whilst 
baking in a tin of boiling water, and being covered 
with a buttered paper. This dish can be mode of 
almost anything, and is equally good with Ix^jf, cut 
up poultry, rabbit, &c. j inde(jd, a very toothsome 
form, much appreciated by West Country men who 
approve of " squab pie," and such delicacies, is mode 
with small pork chops, onions, apples and potatoes. 
All these versions are excellent for shooting lunches, 
^. So also is 

Irish Stew. — Cut up the scrag and best end of a 
neck of mutton into neat pieces; peel some ^gocA 



86 MEATS. 

potatoes, and weigh them after peeling ; slice them 
rather thickly or quarter them, lay a good layer of 
these at the bottom of the pot, then the meat nicely 
seasoned with pepper only, then a thin layer of sliced 
or minced onion, and repeat these layers till the pan 
is fuU, finishing with potato ; now pour in some 
water (cold), bring it to the boil, add the salt, and 
let it all simmer slowly and steadily for two hours, 
and serve very hot. Allow for each pound of meat 
(including the bone), at least two pounds of potato, a 
small onion, joz. of pepper, ^oz. of salt, and a gill of 
cold water. This is a very good sportsman's lunch, 
as it will keep hot and good indefinitely. 

Cape JBredee — Cut up about 21b. of mutton (the 
loin is best, but breast or scrag wHl do), and fry tiiis, 
with two onions cut up small, in dripping till of a 
nice brown, being careful it does not bum. Now 
add to this twelve or fourteen large tomatoes sliced, 
salt, a small teaspoonful of sugar (unless the 
tomatoes are dead ripe), and a quarter of a red 
chilli, and let this all stew gently in a rather shallow 
stewpan till the meat is cooked, and there is a rich 
thick gravy. K the tomatoes are too watery, stew it 
all for a little, imcovered, to thicken it. As a matter 
of fact this is really a Malay form of Irish stew, and 
the native cooks will use all sorts of vegetables for it, 
with or instead of, the tomatoes. An excellent 
form of this dish is made by using dried beans 
instead of the tomatoes. Soak and then parboil 
two or three cupfuls of dried beans for each 
poimd of meat fried as above with onions, 
add them to the meat when this is browned, with 



MUTTON. 87 

a pint of the water in which the beans were cooked, 
and a small cut up chilli, and stew it all gently 
together till tender, which it will be in an hour or 
two, according to the size of the meat. 

Sheep's Head, — This is an essentially Scotch dish, 
but it is one to which the southerner takes very 
kindly. In Scotland the head is sent to the black- 
smith and all the hair, &c., singed off it ; it is then 
laid in hot, or rather warm water and left to soak for 
some hours. It must now be scraped till perfectly 
flejin, then split and the brains removed. Jiomove 
the (iyes, scrape and cleanse the nostrils, and again 
wash and soak the head in warm salted water. The 
sheep's trotters should always accompany the head 
and be cleaned in the same way. Now put the 
head and the trotters in a pan with two carrots and 
a turnip cut up, and water enough to cover them, 
bring this to the boil, and then let it cook till the 
skin is tender, which it should be in about three 
hours. Boil the brains in salted water acidulated 
with vinegar or lemon juice, for ten minutes, then 
drain and mince them. Now lay the two sides of 
the head flat on a hot dish, pour good parsley sauce 
over them and garnish with the brains, the Ixotters, 
and the carrot and turnip with which the head was 
cooked. When a sheep's head is cooked in this 
way in Scotland the liquor is always used for 
Sheep's head broth. It should be carefully freed 
from fat when cold ; then put on with a teacupful 
of well washed pearl barley, and left to boil for 
half an hour; two carrots and two turnips cut 
into dice, two sliced onions and a bunch of 



88 MEATS. 

parsley are then put in and the whole cooked 
slowly for two hours, seasoning it with salt only. 
Sheep's head cooked thus is often made into a 
pie. Cook the head and the trotters till the bones 
will come away, and cut up the meat neatly. Put 
a layer of this meat in a piedish, sprinkle it with 
pepper, salt, powdered ginger and mace, then place 
on it a layer of sliced bacon and hard-boiled eggs 
(oysters may be used with or instead of these), 
repeating these layers till the dish is full, when you 
cover it with rough puff paste and bake for one and 
a half hours. 

Haggis. — ^This is a dish seldom seen south of the 
Tweed, and, indeed, there are people who say that 
it is dying out up in the north, but this may be set 
down as a libel. Anyway, experio crede, 'tis an 
extremely toothsome dish if the cook will only take 
the trouble to make it properly. Get your butcher 
to supply you with a sheep's pluck, and the large 
and one of the small Htomach bags of the animal, 
wash these latter well in cold water, and then in 
boiling water, scraping fchem well, but being careful 
not to break them. After this leave them in cold 
salted water till the next day. Well wash the pluck, 
then put it into a saucepan full of boiling water, 
leaving the windpipe to hang out over the side that 
the blood, &c., may escape, and let it boil for one 
and a half hours ; then lift it out and let it get 
c(»ld. Now cut away the windpipe with any fat or 
gristle adhering to it ; grate about a quarter of the 
Uver, and mince another quarter with the heart, 
lights, and about half a pound of good beef or 



Teal soet (the icst of tlie firer will not Ix' wunttnl) ; 
now mix this mineed meat with thive or four par- 
boiled and fin^ minced onions, two teaoupfuls of 
oatmeal, preTioiislj well dried in the OTen or totisttnl 
in front of the fire, black pepper, and salt to UisU>t 
and half a pint of the liquor in which tlio phiok 
was cooked. Fill the bags about half full with tluM 
mixture (if orerfilled they will burst), ivud Ht^w 
them up; put them into a large pui full of boiling: 
water and boil them for three hours, priokin^: tho 
skins now and again to prevent thoir burMtiu^i 
then serve on a hot dish without any ^^anuMh ni'

to tlie boil, and let it simmer gently and steadily 
till the vegetables are tender (in an hour and a half 
to two hours) ; then take them out and set them 
aside, re-covering the pan and letting the neck 
simmer slowly three or four hours longer. When 
cooked lift out the neck and keep it hot. Stand 
the strained gravy in a pan of cold water and skim 
carefully when cool enough; then reduce it by 
sharp boiling to about a pint. Return the neck to 
this gravy and let it heat well througli for twenty 
to thirty niinuties. M(*auwhile mince the vegetal)h»a 
c>ooked with the nock, put tliem in a pan with a 
little butter or clarified dripping, and toss thoni 
over the fire till thoroughly hot, when you use them 
to garnish the neck as you dish it. The neck 
cooked thus should be carved saddle fashion. 

Neck of mutton a la Turque, — For this you require 
the whole of the neck. With the scrag and trimmings 
make some good mutton broth, cut the best end of the 
neck (or earre) into a neat joint, put the broth 
made the previous day on to boil, then lay into it 
the joint with an equal weight of onions, carrots, 
and turnips (say J^lb. of each), loz. of celery, a good 
bouquet, and a due seasoning of salt and pepper. 
Bring the broth to the boil, then draw it to the 
side and keep it simmering till the mutton is tender, 
which it should be in about one and a half hours 
over a slow fire ; now strain off the broth, leaving 
the meat in the closely covered pan to keep hot. 
Bring this broth sharply to the boil, then put into 
it 6oz. of Patna rice, and keep it boiling fast

CHAPTEE V. 

LAMB. 

Op the choice of lamb something has already been 
said, so that point need not now be considered. 
Lamb is now practically attainable nearly all the 
year round, especially by those who do not despise 
Colonial meat, and, indeed, there are many con- 
noisseurs who uphold colonial lamb especially as a 
worthy rival of the home-grown animal. The latter 
is, however, in season, roughly speaking, from 
November to August, 7iou8e»lamh, i.e., that reared 
under shelter, often actually in the house, and 
principally if not entirely fed on milk (generally 
most highly esteemed by gourmets), and grasS'lamh, 
which is brought up out of doors and fed on the 
young spring grass. The first is obtainable from 
a little before Christmas until Easter, (i.e., from 
December to the end of March or the beginning 
of April), the last conies in about Easter (or April), 
and lasts till the end of July ; sine gua non on the 
Easter-day dinner table. 

Lamb is usually, certainly at its first appearance, 
served in quarters, that is to say, the carcase is 



LAMB. 93 

divided lengthwise down the spine, each half being 
then again divided in two, leaving two haunches, 
i.e., the hind leg and loin cat in one; and two 
fore-quarters, this latter comprising the neck end 
of the animal, including the neck (scrag and best 
end), the shoulder, and breast. These four joints 
are each cooked whole as long as the lamb is small, 
but later, when it has increased in size (or in cases 
where the family is not large), it is cut up pretty 
much like a sheep. It must l)e remembered that 
lamb, like all young meat, requires thorough cooking 
to be wholesome. 

Fore-quarter of Lanih to Boast, — Wrap the joint 
in the caul or filmy substance any good butcher 
always sends with lamb for roasting, and cook it at 
a clear, sharp fire, basting it generously all the time 
it is cooking (this is a point that needs special 
attention if the joint is necessarily baked in the 
oven) ; roast it quickly, but be careful the fat does 
not catch, from the close proximity of the fire if 
roasted at an open fire, or from an over-sharp oven 
if baked ; lamb's fat is peculiarly liable to catch or 
bum. When cooked and nicely browned it is often 
considered a good plan to lift off the shoulder with 
a sharp knife, so as to separate it from the ribs ; a 
little pat of maitre d'hotel butter, or a little butter 
rubbed up with cayenne and lemon juice, is by 
many persons then inserted between the shoulder, 
or target as it is sometimes called, and the ribs, 
and allowed to /melt there. It is a matter of taste 
whether this jointing and flavouring be performed 
after or before it is placed on the table. Whichever 



r' 



94 MEATS. 

method is adopted, every cook should be careful to 
see that the chine bone has been thoroughly divided, 
and the rib bones divided across perfectly. Neglect 
of this precaution leads to no end of trouble to the 
carver, and probably also to the destruction of the 
tablecloth, for it is well nigh impossible to divide the 
joint thus after it is dished without splashing the 
gravy pretty considerably ; even granting the carver 
possess both the requisite skill and strength for the 
dissection. 

Roast lamb is served with its own gravy, freed 
from grease, just like any other roast joint, mint 
sauce being sent to table in a separate boat. You 
reckon about fifteen minutes to the pound, and 
fifteen minutes over, for the fore-quarter. The hind 
quarter, or indeed any part of lamb, is roasted 
precisely as above, only remembering that the hind 
quarter being more solid and thicker than the fore- 
quarter, will probably take twenty minutes to the 
pound. 

For the mint sauce, mince finely the tops of some 
well-washed and dried young mint into the sauce- 
boat, add to this some caster sugar, stirring it well 
together, then pour over it all some good vinegar 
(using about five tablespoonfuls of the vinegar to 
three of the minced mint, and two of caster sugar), 
and continue stirring it till the sugar is dissolved. 
Let it stand for two or three hours before using it. 
Another and more delicate form is obtained by 
putting a gill of best vinegar into a pan with a small 
tablespoonful of caster or loaf sugar, and reducing it 
by sharp boiling to half ; now add a full haK pint of 



LAMB. J*5 

water, bring it sharply to the boil, let it boil for oue 
minute, then stir in a good tablespoonful of finely 
chopped mint, mix it all thoroughly, and serve when 
perfectly cold. 

Lamb may also be braised io the usual manner, 
and is then served with a variety of sauces and 
garnishes. It must be observed that braising is a 
method of cooking usually reserved for lamb when 
large enough to serve in joints. Abroad, lamb when 
quite young, say about five weeks old, is often 
roasted or braised whole, and affords a very delicate 
dish, which is, moreover, also an uncommon one, 

Lanib, Boasted Whole, — Skin the animal, and 
cleanse it precisely as if it were a rabbit, which 
indeed when skinned it resembles not a littU? ; cut 
off the feet, and then cover the whole carcaHe with 
thin slices of larding bacon (i.e., fat and rather 
firm unsmoked bacon), and roast it at a clear fire, 
allowing fully twenty minutes to the pound. Ffteen 
minutes or so before it is done, remove the ]mc<jn 
and let it brown all over equally, then squeeze tho 
juice of a lemon over it, and send to table with a 
boat of good espagnole sauce. Lamb cooked thus ih 
often placed on a bed of mushroom, or any other 
puree, and served with an appropriate sauce ; or it 
can be sent to table on a bed of savoury ri(;o, or 
boiled macaroni, stirred up with good meat gravy 
and tomato sauce as for rau, and sent up with 
tomato or curry sauce. 

Lamb of the same age and size is also braised 
thus : skin and cleanse it as before, and cut it right 
across in half, so as to leave the kidneys attached 



96 MEATS. 

to ilie hindquarters. Now place botli halves in a 
well buttered stewpan, with a few slices of ham or 
bacon, a good bouquet garni, two bay leaves, a 3in. 
stick of cinnamon, a few peppercorns, and pepper 
and salt to taste. Moisten it with a full pint of 
mutton broth or stock, bring it to the boil, and then 
let it simmer very steadily for about two and a half 
hours, tightly covered down, with fire above and 
below ; or in the oven with top and bottom heat. 
Dish, strain, and skim the liquor and serve with 
the gravy poured over and round the meat. Both 
these processes are applied to young Md as well as 
to lamb abroad, and, needless to state, that much 
variety is allowed in the addenda for the braised 
lamb; red and green peppers, tomatoes, rice, <fcc., 
being all utilised. 

It is useless to repeat these directions, as lamb 
is always roasted or braised ia the same way, the 
only difference being a question of time, which 
practice and commonsense will easily settle. So 
a few of the methods of garnishing this joint 
need alone be given. 

Quartier d'Agneau a VHoteliere (or a la MaUre 
d^ Hotel, — For this the fore-quarter is roasted and 
served with a creamy maitre d'hotel sauce, i.e., a 
rich white sauce made with new milk, and flavoured 
with a tea spoonful of freshly minced parsley, a 
squeeze of lemon juice, and a little white pepper 
and salt for each half pint of sauce. 

farcl aux huitres. — Remove the shank, 

raise the thick part from the bone and insert a rich 
oyster forcemeat, then roast as before and serve 



LAMB. 97 

with Madeira sauce, well flavoured with lemon juice, 
or a good brown oyster sauce may be used. 

Leg of Lamb a VAllemande, — (As a matter of 
fact, a leg, haunch, saddle, &c., can be served thus, 
or, indeed, by any of the following methods.) Roast 
and serve with a rich allemande sauce, and either a 
vegetable macedoine (of young spring vegetables, 
such as asparagus points, green peas, &c.), or boiled 
mushrooms. 

Leg of Lamb a VIndienne. — Roast and serve with 
a garnish of pickles and chutney, and a rich 
bechamel, strongly flavoured with curry powder. 
Another form of this dish is made by boning and 
stuffing the leg or shoulder with a rich veal force- 
meat, and braising it, then serving it with its own 
liquor, strained, freed from grease, and thickened 
with tomato puree, curry paste, and a little essence 
of anchovy. 

Carre WAgneau a la Valencienne, — The best end 
of the neck, nicely trimmed, roast and served with 
its own gravy and a good Valencienne garnish of 
artichoke bottoms, lobster, or prawns, rice, minced 
or shred ham, &c. This joint, which is a particularly 
nice one for a small family, is equally good if served 
with any good puree of vegetables and its own 
gravy; or with mushroom, cucumber, oyster, soubise, 
tomato, Venitienne, and many other sauces. In 
short, broadly speaking, as soon as it is large enough 
to cut up, lamb may be served by any recipe given 
for mutton, though, of course, the judicious cook 
will remember, that lamb being a more delicately 
flavoured meat than mutton, which has a distix\atvi«^ 



98 MEATS. 

flavour of its own not easily disguised by any sauce, 
care must bo taken to choose addenda that will not 
overpower, if not actually destroy, the natural taste 
of the younger animal. 

As owing to the size of these little books it is 
impossible for me to repeat information given in 
previous volumes of the series, I must ask those 
interested in these recipes to refer to the volume of 
entrees for the sauces, which are there given in 
extenso. 

It may be added thafc a boiled leg of lamb, especi- 
ally when small, is a specially delicate little dish, 
particularly if served with tomato or soubise sauce, 
or even with a creamy Pascaline, or caper saaoe. 



CHAPTER VI. 

PORK. 

It cannot be too often repeated that ill-fed, or 
out-of-season, pork is not only unwholesome, but 
actually dangerously so, and it is much to be wished 
that the authorities could see their way to prevent 
the sale of fresh pork after the beginning of spring. 
Abroad, in the south especially, fresh pork is a 
forbidden luxury from the end of April (or even 
earlier) till the beginning of November, and we 
have most of us learnt the hygienic reason for the 
avoidance of pork by Jew and Mussulman. There- 
fore, tiever buy cheap pork, and never deal with a 
pork butcher you cannot thoroughly rely on. 

Pork, to Boast, — When the skin is left on (as most 
people prefer), it should be scored through in narrow 
strips, as evenly as possible, and, contrary to the 
usual process, the meat should be placed at first at 
some distance from the fire, to allow the actual meat 
to heat through before the skin hardens and browns. 
Roast pork as a joint is now seldom seen at soigne 
tables, and still less with the sage and onion stufiing^ 



100 MEATS. 

formerly considered indispensable. Very often now, 
the fat, formerly considered the tit-bit, is pared off, 
and then, naturally, pork takes a shorter time to 
roast. But the average time is fully twenty minutes 
to the pound, and twenty minutes over. These rules 
apply to all joints of pork, so need not be repeated. 
The usual accompaniments of roast pork are apple 
sauce, and its own gravy, but these may be varied 
almost indefinitely. Amongst the sauces which go 
admirably with roast pork are sauce Robert, 
remoulade, tomato, poivrade, &c., and these can be 
served with either the leg, the loin, the spare rib, or 
the best end of the neck, (which forms a very nice 
little joint), indifferently. Almost any joint of pork 
may be pickled and boiled ; for instance, take a leg of 
pork that has been salted for a few days, and weigh 
it carefully ; now soak it for half an hour in cold 
water (this improves the colour), then lift it out, 
dust it with sifted flour, and tie it up in a delicately 
clean cloth. Put it into a stewpan with sufficient 
cold water to cover it thoroughly ; bring this gently 
to the boil, then skim it well, cover the pan down 
closely, draw it to the side of the stove, and let it 
simmer gently till done, allowing twenty-five minutes 
to each pound of meat. Serve on a hot dish gar- 
nished with separately boiled cabbages, well drained 
and quartered, and with neatly shred cooked parsnip. 
Pease pudding should be served in a separate dish. 
For this soak 21b. of split peas for twelve hours or 
so, wash them well, and place them in a pan well 
covered with cold water; bring this to the boil, 
tJien at once strain off the peaa, an^ xYEk»^ >(>[i<^\a 



PORK. 101 

well in more cold water ; now return them to 
the stewpan with three quarts of water, a dessert 
spoonful of salt, a good pinch of cayenne, and 
4oz. of butter; bring to the boil, put a cover on 
the pan, and let it simmer on the side of the 
stove for about two hoars and a half (keeping 
the peas occasionally stirred), when they should be 
perfectly tender and quite a puree ; pass through 
the sieve, re-warm in a bain-marie, dish up in a pile, 
and serve. (Remember the liquor in which pork is 
boiled should always be kept as a foundation for 
pea soup.) Boiled pork may be served with various 
garnishes; for instance, served with stewed red 
cabbage, carrots, turnips, and poivrade sauce (when 
it is known as pork a VAllemande) ; or if liked, it can 
be served with the vegetables used in cooking it, and 
sent to table accompanied by celery, parsley, soubise, 
or tomato sauce. Pork again, especially the loin, or 
the best end of the neck, is frequently braised ; that 
is to say, a large saucepan is lined with four or five 
carrots, two or three turnips, some celery, and two or 
three onions, all sliced down, with an ounce or two 
of pork dripping or lard ; the pork is then laid in, 
the pan carefully covered down, and the whole fried 
for fifteen to twenty minutes, according to size, then 
a little stock is poured in at the side, the whole is 
covered with a buttered paper, the lid replaced on 
the pan, and the contents are braised in the oven 
with heat top and bottom ; pork cooked thus may be 
served on a hot dish with the vegetables cooked with 
it, neatly cut up as a garnish, ita llci^<5»x ^«5ivixfc^ 
round it, or part of it sent to \«k\Aa m ^\jQi^\ ^"^ ^ 



102 MEATS. 

may be served with pickled cabbage, potato cro- 
quettes, and little fried balls of sausage meat; or 
carefully freed from fat and served with orange 
sauce and sultanas blanched in dear stock; or it 
may be served with a purfe of chestnuts and espag- 
nole sauce ; in short, many sauces to taste may be 
utilised with this meat. 

A favourite joint at the present time is a ham, 
either baked, roast, or braised, and served with 
various addenda. For instance, trim a nice York 
ham, and soak it for ten or twelve hours, changing 
the water now and again ; now wipe it dry, fold it in 
a sheet of well greased paper, and then in a sheet of 
water paste (i.e., common flour mixed with water to 
a stiffish paste, and rolled out as required) ; the ham 
can now be either baked or roasted for three hours 
or so, keeping it well basted with fat whilst cooking ; 
when cooked remove the paste, paper, and skin, put 
it into a baking dish, pour over it one and a half to 
two gills of wine (sherry, Marsala, or champagne, as 
you choose), brush it well with glaze, and leave it in 
tlie oven for fifteen minutes or so till crisp and 
nicely browned, basting it now and again with the 
wine. It may then be served with a pur^e of 
spinach, and either champagne or Madeira sauce, 
according to the wine used ; or it may be served 
with bigarade sauce, and iced orange salad. (For 
this free the oranges from all skin and white pith, 
cut them into the natural divisions, carefully remov- 
ing all pips, then sprinkle this orange pulp with a 
little finely chopped tarragon and chervil, a spoonful 
of salad oil, half this quantity of brandy, and a

basting it well with wine, and brushing it over with 
glaze, after removing the skin. If to be served 
cold, skin it and at once strew it over pretty thickly 
with fried crumbs, or dried and browned bread 
raspings. A bay leaf or two, a bunch of herbs, and 
two or three carrots cooked with the ham improve 
its flavour, and if to be served cold the ham may be 
left to cool in its liquor, as this renders it mellower, 
though it does not then keep so well as when plainly 
boiled. Be sure if a copper pan is used for cooking 
a ham, to lift the latter out of it the moment it is done, 
as nothing should ever, on any accotmt, be allowed 
to get cold in a copper pan. It is a well-known fact 
that on more than one occasion guests at wedding 
breakfasts or ball suppers have suffered from in- 
attention to this point. A favourite, and, indeed, a 
few seasons ago a very fashionable, dish was boiled 
bacon and broad beans. For this choose a nice piece 
of the back or streaky part of the bacon, and boil 
it for a couple of hours, then skin it, strew it 
thickly with dried and sifted breadcrumbs, and 
serve in a dish with plainly boiled broad beans (if 
these are old remove the outer skin before dishing 
them), and send to table with parsley butter sauce 
in a boat. 

Sucking Fig is an old-fashioned and excellent, if 
fearfully rich, dish. The little pig should be small, 
and is best at three weeks old. It should be cooked 
as soon as it is killed, as its flesh taints very 
quickly, and, unless it is fresh, nothing will render 
the crackling — ^which is considered a great delicacy 
by connoisseurs — as crisp as it should be. It is 



PORK. 1(V» 

cooked thus: Stuff the pig well with a bh^^ hiuI 
onion stuffing, sewing np the belly; then bnish tho 
pig all OTer with good salad oil, and wrap it in an 
oiled paper or one that has been 8tee[)e<l in dinsolvod 
bntt^y tieing this on firmly ; now bake or roant it 
for two and a half to three hours, according to »m\ 
keeping it well basted all the time. As a mattor of 
fact, one of the difficulties about sucking pi^ in tliat 
whilst it is cooking, if to be a success, tlie cook can 
never leave it for a moment, as it needs iu<H«HHant 
attention. About half an hour before it is iiniHluMl 
remove the paper, brush the pig all over with thitik 
cream, and return it to the fire or oven to criH)> and 
colour. It should be, when ready, a d(M»|) ^'oldtai 
yellow. Now cut off the head, split the body <lowu 
lengthwise, and lay the two halves on a hot dinli with 
the head at the top. Serve with a ^ood browu 
sauce, and apple sauce in boats, aud cnrrautM (whioh 
have been well washed, dried, aud set in tho ovuu 
for ten minutes) on a napkin. A sucking pig niuut 
be served very hot. For the sage and onion stujflnfft 
peel and cut into small dice six or seven onions aud 
put them on in enough cold water to cover tlioui, 
with a pinch of salt, and bring this sharj^ly to 
the boil, when they are all drained, well rinsed iu cold 
water and dried ; melt 3oz. or 4oz. of butter iu a ptiu, 
lay in the onion, and fry gently for twenty miuutos 
without letting this colour ; now season with salt, 
cayenne pepper, and a very tiny dust of sugar ; tlien 
mix in a pint of white freshly-grated breadcrumbs, 
and two tablespoonfuls of minced sage, stir well 
together, a.nd use. Sucking pig is also stuffed with 



lOe MEATS. 

a chestnut and sausage stuffing, and finished off as 
before ; it is then served with a rich Madeira sauce, 
to which have been sieved some chestnuts previously 
cooked till tender in well-flavoured brown stock ; a 
Chipolata garnish being sent to table or not, as 
liked. For the chestnut and sausage-meed stvffing, 
peel, scald, and blanch forty to fifty good chestnuts, 
and boil them in a pint of milk, with a pinch of salt 
and ^oz. of butter till quite tender, and mix them 
with a pound of good sausage-meat. Fill the body of 
the pig with this and sew it up carefully. Or it may 
be stuffed with a truffle farce, and served with P^ri- 
geux sauce. For the truffle stuffingy well wash, 
brush, and dry a pound of nice fresh truffles, and 
quarter them ; mince and pound to a paste |lb. of 
very fat bacon, and in this stew the truffles with 
half a teaspoonful of minced thyme, a shallot, a bay- 
leaf, and pepper and salt to taste, for ten minutes or 
so, when the farce is ready for use. Another form 
of sucking pig is stuffed with a very rich veal force- 
meat (either with or without jpa^e defoie gras). The 
pig is tied up in a cloth and stewed very gently in 
stock with the usual stock vegetables. It is then 
lifted out, the cloth removed, dished on a hot dish, 
and sent to table with good espagnole; or, if pre- 
ferred, with an allemande and a garnish of mush- 
rooms. If left to cool in its liquor, it is very good 
cold. 



CHAPTER VII. 

VENISON. 

Of venison there are three kinds known in the 
British Isles, the red deer, principally found in 
Scotland and Ireland; the roedeer, best known in 
the north; and the fallow deer, which is most 
common in England. The red deer and the roe are 
drier than the fallow deer, which put on both flesh 
and fat more freely than their wilder brethren. 

Buck venison is usually reckoned the best, and is 
seasonable from June to the end of September, 
whilst doe venison comes into the market in October, 
and lasts to the end of December. Neither should 
be used at other times. 

Venison in good condition should have the flesh 
dark and fine grained, with a plentiful supply of 
firm, white, and clear fat (this applies to fallow 
deer, for roedeer especially has little or no fat). 
The thicker the layer of fat on the haunch the 
better is the condition of the animal; if the hoof, 
which is always left on, is deeply cleft, rough, and 
large, the beast is old, so if the cleft is small and 



108 MEATS. 

smooth it naturally is young. Deer, however, like 
sheep, should be of a certain age to be eaten in per- 
fection. From four to five years is supposed to be 
the right period. A fallow deer is cut up in the 
same way as mutton, of which a diagram was given, 
though it is not sold in joints as a rule, quarters 
being generally adopted. Venison, if kept in an 
airy, cool larder, will hang from one to three weeks, 
according to the state of the weather, but it needs 
watching, as in damp muggy weather it turns very 
quickly. As soon as it is brought in and cut up it 
should be well wiped all over with a clean dry cloth, 
and freely dusted with black pepper or ground 
ginger, or a mixture of both, as you choose. It 
should be looked over and carefully dried every day, 
and even twice a day if the weather is doubtful. 
There is seldom a ^chance of buying absolutely fresh 
venison (which it should be to give it a proper 
chance of hanging), but there is a good deal of 
difference between hung venison and stale venison 
which has not been properly looked after, a fact that 
may be easily ascertained by running a small knife, 
or very clean steel skewer, well in along the bone, when 
the difference of smell will betray the condition. If 
venison becomes a trifle musty from a little careless- 
ness, it should be well washed first in tepid water, 
then in tepid milk and water, well dried, and again 
freely powdered with ground ginger or black pepper. 
It must be remembered that, like sheep, deer should 
be skinned whilst hot, directly they are killed. The 
haunch, the shoulder, and the breast may all be 
roasted ; so can the neck, but it is better either made 



VENISON. 109 

into chops or into a pasty ; the shank and head are 
usually thrown away, but make excellent stock if 
properly treated. 

To Boast ike Haunch, — Well wipe it all over with 
a damp clean cloth, or, if preferred, wash it care- 
fully, using as little water as possible, then dry it 
perfectly in clean cloths, and wrap it in a sheet of 
paper previously well brushed over with salad oil or 
dissolved butter; cover this again with a sheet of 
water paste as previously described, and, lastly, 
wrap this all in another buttered sheet of paper, 
tieing this firmly into position, and place it before a 
clear strong fire, keeping it well basted all the time 
with butter and well clarified fat. It will, if large, 
take from four to five hours to cook, as it should be 
rather under than overdone, as it is so dry a meat. 
From thirteen minutes to the pound is the general 
reckoning with the paste (which should be from -J in. 
to fin. thick) wrapped on it. About twenty minutes 
or so before it is done the papers and paste must be 
taken ofE, the joint well basted all over with butter, 
and then lightly dredged with fine, dry, and sifted 
flour, and delicately browned before the fire. It 
must be remembered that the fat of the venison is 
the prime part, so the great object of the cook is to 
have this in perfection. The gravy is made precisely 
as for sirloin of beef, i.e., the fat is poured ofE the 
top, a gill of boiling water is poured into the dripping 
pan, and well mixed with the gravy in it, paying 
special attention to the little brown blisters of glaze 
adhering to the pan ; skim off the fat from this, salt 
it to taste, let it boil up, then pour it through a 



no MEATS. 

strainer round the haunch, which should be put on a 
very hot dish. It must be borne in mind that 
nothing chills so quickly as venison fat, so the dish 
and also the plates used should be as hot as it is 
possible to get them. Hot water dishes, where pro- 
curable, are best for the purpose. Currant or rowan 
jelly (slightly warmed, that it niay not chill the 
meat) should always be handed round, and some 
cooks send espagnole or sauce chevreuil to table with 
it ; but for well fed, well hung fallow deer venison 
its own gravy and a little currant jelly are to be 
preferred. I give the following, " lifted " from Meg 
Dod's admirable Cookery Manual, as I can speak 
from experience of its excellence for either red or roe 
deer, or ibex venison, the last probably about the 
driest form of venison extant. "Eub the haunch 
well with mixed spices; soak it for six hours in 
claret to which you have added either a gill of best 
vinegar, or the juice of three lemons, turning it 
frequently and basting it well with the liquid. 
Strain this, mix it with sufficient butter melted, and 
use this mixture for basting the meat ; a large sheet 
of buttered paper should be wrapped round the 
joint, soon after it is put down to the fire, and the 
joint well basted over this ; fifteen minutes before 
the joint is ready remove the paper, &c., and finish 
it off as before. For the sauce : To the contents of 
the dripping pan (which will be very rich and 
highly flavoured) add half a pint of clear brown 
gravy, made from the venison, or old heath mutton, 
boil this all up sharply together, then skim, add a 
teaspoonful of walnut ketchup (or, indeed, any 



VENISON. Ill 

flayoured vinegar, such as raspberry, anchovy, or 
shallot vinegar as you please), bring it just to tlie 
boil again and strain it round the joint. It should 
always be remembered that unless it is fairly fat, it 
is foolish to attempt to roast this venison, but if 
needs must, for hashing purposes, only three; parts 
cook it, set it aside uncut till perfectly cold, and whtjn 
about to hash it have ready some nice slices of pfood 
well hung mutton fat, if possible from a roa8t<;d loiu 
or neck, but if raw, previously lightly stewdd in red 
wine sweetened with brown sugar, and slightly 
acidulated with a flavoured vinegar ; add these when 
cooked to the hash, allowing them to steep well in 
the venison gravy before putting in the venison 
itself." This recipe is also good for red deijr. It 
must be remembered that generous and careful 
basting is a sine qud non for success in roasting 
venison, for it is only the fallow deer that can be 
depended on for fat, and for a haunch of this it 
may be well to carry out the old directions for 
carving : Make a sharp slice across the knuckle end 
to ensure the flow of gravy, then slice the joint 
thinly the whole length of the haunch, remembering 
that the choicest part is where the fat is (chiefly on 
the left side, which is, in consequence, sarcastically 
called the " alderman's walk "). A sauce sometimes 
sent to table with roast roe or red deer venison is 
made by dissolving 4oz. of loaf sugar, or preferably 
white sugar candy, in half a pint of the very best 
French white wine vinegar, keeping it well skimmed, 
and sending it to table in a hot sauceboat. 

A favourite way of cooking the haunch of venison, 



112 MEATS. 

especially of roedeer, is this : Either hang it up fol 
a few days, or take it down after about twenty-four 
hours,. and soak it in sour milk for a couple of days 
in a cool place ; take it out, dry off all the moisture, 
remove the skin, lard it plentifully, salt it, and bake 
it in a fireproof dish in a good oven, basting it with 
butter or very fresh lard, and pouring a little white 
or red wine over it occasionallv, not more than a 
couple of tablespoonfuls twice or three times during 
the cooking process ; when the meat is done and of a 
rich brown, put it on a hot dish, pour a teacupf ul of 
sour cream over the meat, and set it in a hot place 
while the sauce is being made ; strain the liquor in 
which the venison has been baked, put it over the 
fire in a small saucepan, let it gently boil to reduce 
it, season it to taste, add a few chopped mushrooms 
previously slightly browned in butter, finish off with 
a tablespoonful of fresh cream ; let it boil up once 
more, pour it over the joint, and serve very hot with 
a compote of fresh fruit and green salad. 

In America, a roast haunch of venison is often 
sent to table with the following sauce : Mix together 
a pint of rich tomato puree with a gill of good strong 
stock (or a teaspoonful of glaze or of Lemco), then 
stir in a teaspoonful of chopped capers, and when 
these are all blended add a good spoonful of currant 
or rowan jelly, season with salt, a pinch each of 
sugar and ground ginger, cayenne, and a squeeze of 
lemon juice, thickening this sauce if necessary with 
a spoonful of brown roux. Send this to table, very 
hot, in a boat, pouring a little plain gravy from 
itself round the joint. 



VENISOlf. 113 

Shoulder of Venison to Stew. — Bone a well-hun^ 
ehoulder, lay it out flat ou the board, f^ettin^ the 
surface as even as possible, then lay over it some thin 
slices of well hung moor mutton, sprinkle well with 
spice, and roll it all up tightly, tieing it into shajie 
with broad tape. Place this roll into a pan that will 
just hold it comfortably, and cover it with good rich 
stock made from its own bone, or with good ordinary 
stock; just bring it to the boil, then let it stew 
slowly and steadily till about three parts done ; now 
add a plentiful allowance of freshly ground black 
and cayenne pepper, allspice, and lastly, half a pint 
of good claret, burgundy, or port, and fluish the 
cooking. When tender lift it out, remove the tapes, 
brusb it over with glaze, set it on a very hot dish, 
strain its own gravy round it, and send to table with 
currant jelly, and any venison sauce to taste, in a 
boat. It will take about three hours to cook. This 
is an excellent way of using lean venison. 

Venison Oollops are an excellent Scotch dish, 
seldom, However, seen south of the Tweed. For 
these slice down a piece of the fillet rather thinly 
(any part that will produce thin cutlet-shax>ed pieces 
wiU do), seasoning each highly with qtiatre epices ; 
make some good salt butter hot in a stew-pan, and 
brown the venison nicely in this with some minced 
onion (taking one middle-sized onion for each ^Ib. 
of meat), and when well coloured add to this a gill 
each of good strong gravy or stock, and claret or 
Burgundy, a dust of caster sugar, a sherry-glassful 
of good white wine vinegar, and some fried bread- 
crumbs. Now cover down the pan closely and let it 

X 



114 MEATS. 

all stew very slowly till cooked, then dish with its 
own gravy round it. It will be found convenient, 
unless the venison is very fat of itself, to add some 
slices of mutton fat cut from the neck of a well 
hung sheep (treated as for hash as given above), 
and cook this with it. Needless, of course, to add 
that the venison is improved by having been well 
marinaded previous to cooking. Another Scotch, 
and most excellent, dish is minced collops, capital — 
like the preceding — ^when made of beef, but naturally 
extremely delicate when made of venison. For this 
choose a good fleshy piece, and mince it fine, after 
removing the skin, sinews, gristle, <fcc. ; dredge 
generously with flour, season well with quatre Spices, 
or kitchen pepper, and mix with a little water or 
stock ; heat some butter or clarified dripping in the 
pan, and in this brown the mince and a little very 
finely chopped onion, beating the meat with a wooden 
spoon all the time it is cooking to prevent its getting 
lumpy, which it will do if neglected ; a little more 
stock may be added from time to time, to get it to 
the desired consistency. Serve with sippets of toast 
round it, and, if liked, poached eggs on top. Beef, 
veal, hare, <fcc., can all be cooked in this way. The 
onion is a matter of taste, but most people like it ; 
indeed, many cooks also allow a bunch of herbs to 
stew with the meat, of course removing this before 
dishing it. 

Venison Steaks are also good, and easily prepared ; 
cut them into shape, brush them well with liquefied 
butter, roll in seasoned breadcrumbs, and broil over 
a clear sharp fire. Serve with good venison gravy 



VENlSOlf. 115 

in a boat. In America these steaks are often served 
with a little dear gravy round them, and cranberry 
sauce in a boat. For liiis lake a pint of well picked 
and washed berries, put them into an enamel pan 
with sufficient water to cover them (about half a 
pint), and cook till tender, when you add from 5oz. 
to 6oz. of sugar, and lift off the fire directly the 
sugar is melted. Serve hot or cold (always hot foi 
venison). This mixture, if strained into a mould, 
will set like a jelly ; whilst if the berries are carefully 
chosen for size and beauty, and cooked very slowly 
without any stirring, they will be whole in a clear 
transparent sauce. This sau<x) is excellent with 
turkey, poultry of any kind, mutton, <fcc. 

Givet de Chevreuil, — Cut the breast, neck, &c., 
into neat, small pieces, and fry these in clarified 
dripping, or, preferably, bacon fat, tiU nicely 
browned, dredging them pretty thickly with flour ; 
when nicely coloured, moisten them well with equal 
parts of good red wine (Burgundy or Bordeaux), and 
strong stock, add a bouquet garni (parsley, thyme, 
bayleaf, green onion, a strip of lemon peel, a blade 
of mace, and a suspicion of garlic if liked ; this last 
is not necessary). Let this all cook very slowly, 
shaking the pan occasionally to keep its contents 
from sticking. A few silver or button onions, and 
some mushrooms are great additions to this dish, 
which can also be made of hare, rabbit, &c. If 
cooked in an earthenware pan and served in this, 
it frequently appears, on lunch menus especially, as 
chevreuil en casserole, from the name of the dish. 

Eoedeer Steaks and Bacon. — Fry the venison 

i2 



116 MEATS. 

steaks till about half cooked, then lift them out, and 
skewer a thin slice of rather fat bacon on each side 
of every steak, and finish frying. Serve round a hot 
dish, with a mound of cranberry jelly or cold sauce 
in the centre, and hand round bread sauce made 
with stock instead of milk. This recipe is an 
American one, and in the United States is seasoned 
very highly with cayenne, mace, and especially 
cinnamon. 

AlS a matter of fact, you may cook roedeer in 
almost every way in which you cook hare. Jugged 
roedeer, for instance, is particularly savoury. A 
venison pudding again, if carefully cooked and well 
seasoned is excellent, and is made precisely like the 
ordinary beefsteak pudding, unless you follow the 
American plan. For this you cut the venison steaks 
into neat small pieces. Have some small birds 
halved, or poultry, pigeons, or rabbit may be used, 
allowing equal parts of venison and of the birds, and 
1 good kidney sliced, with a little ham or bacon cut 
mto largish dice. Line a pudding basin in the 
usual way with suet crust, and pack in the meat, 
adding at intervals some small pieces of cranberry, 
blackberry, or even currant jelly, and cover it all 
with more crust, after pouring in some good strong 
gravy made from the birds, &c., used in its composi- 
tion. Boil in the usual way. If all this be packed 
in a well-buttered pie-dish and covered with short 
crust, it can be baked, and produces a most praise- 
worthy pasty.

hare, Ac., is the better for being larde«i, with nice 
2in. long lardoons of French larding bacon well 
rolled in quatre epices ; roast or bake this joint as 
you please, but be careful to hare it well basted, 
nsing for the purpose soiu^ cream, or when this is 
not at hand use skim milk, adding 2oz. of fresh 
butter for every half pint of milk. This is served 
with its own gravy tmthickened, but flavoured with 
lemon juice, freshly ground black pepper, and a 
little salt. 

It may be added that smoked venison is occasion- 
ally to be met with, especially in shops catering for 
American customers. This meat, which is generally 
sewn up in canvas like hams, keeps well, and for 
those who like the flavour is a great stand-bye. If 
used for steaks or other dishes of the kind, the meat 
should be soaked in water for a little previous to 
cooking. It may also be boiled, braised, or baked 
like a ham, but takes a rather shorter time per 
pound. For instance, it may be marinivded for 



118 MEATS. 

some time, larded, braised, and finally served with a 
ricli Espagnole sauce made with venison bones, &c„ 
garnished with stewed prunes, when it is known as 
Oimier (saddle), gigot, or qtuirtier de chevreuil, a la 
8t. Hubert, according to the joint used. This can 
also be prepared with fresh venison, but must then 
be marinaded for a good deal longer. 

Lastly, if it is desired to preseiTe venison for 
future use, the joints may be pretty thickly dusted 
with powdered charcoal, which does not in the least 
affect the flavour ; or, after cutting the meat up into 
joints, the bones should be carefully removed, each 
joint being carefully cleansed and cut into suitable 
pieces, convenient for their subsequent use, and then 
packed tightly in a large jar. Strew in with them 
some crushed bay leaves, peppercorns, and pounded 
mace; cover the whole with good beef suet or 
mutton fat, melted over the fire and poured in when 
lukewarm ; when the fat has set tie a muslin over 
the top, and store in a cold place. Woodcock, 
snipe, or indeed any form of game, can also be 
preserved in this way. Separate joints of venison 
can also be preserved by merely brushing them all 
over quickly with lukewarm fat ; when this is cold 
tie the meat up in buttered muslin so as to keep off 
flies and dust. The joint treated in this manner 
must hang till it is wanted, and not be kept with 
fresh provisions, but this method rather weakens 
the peculiar flavour, which is one of the characteris- 
tics of good game.

POULTRY.

As a matter of fact, it were mu4:h to U* df.sir»-d tJuit 
tJie town cook would not be quit*.' so ri'iidy to trust

one's means of utilising these arts to sav tii(> i«':Lst of

a distinct value, as the tradesman knows full woll. 
for he sells poultry livers by the pound (osptH-ially 
now that fashion no longer insists on the symnu^tri- 
cal trussing of liver and gizzard under tlio fowl's 
wings when roasted), and the giblets, ue., the ntvks, 
pinions, and trimmings generally, have an acknow- 
ledged market price of their own for soup making, 
&c., and add a great doal of flavour to the stock pot 
ol the housekeeper who insists on their presence. 



120 MEATS. 

It is the absence of these addenda that recoups the 
shopkeeper for the extra trouble of sending out his 
poultry ready for cooking. 

In choosing a fowl there are several points to be 
considered — age, condition, size, and lastly the use 
to which the bird is to be put. 

A little experience will soon teach a housewife to 
recognise the age. In a young fowl the legs and 
feet are smooth, the scales on the shanks overlapping 
but little, whilst the spurs on the cock are either 
non-existent, or simply little knobs. (Dishonest 
tradesmen often scrape the legs and spurs to mini- 
mise the appearance of age, but though the spurs 
may be satisfactorily doctored, a very little experi- 
9nce will betray the scraping.) After the first year 
a. fowl's legs grow rough, the scales increasing in 
3ize and overlapping more and more, whilst in the 
black-legged variety the scales assume a greyish 
tinge. The comb and the wattles also betray age, 
but this test is not always to be relied on, as breeds 
vary in this respect. Speaking generally, however, 
the comb and wattles should in young birds be 
small, and lie close to the head, but here, again, 
a young pullet that has begun to lay will often 
assume the proi^ortions of a mature fowl. 

As regards condition. Though a fowl will hang 
for a few days, it is always best pretty fresh, for if in 
the slightest degree overhung it is spoiled. For this 
reason at once reject any fowl that shows the slightest 
tinge of green on the flesh. Young housekeepers 
are often tempted by seeing apparently fine chickens 
and fowls set out on the show board of a poulterer's

galantine, &c., the old fowls, whicli are larger and 
also tougher (and consequently cheaper), answer 
admirably. A recipe will also be given by which 
even the oldest fowl can be utilised for roasting if 
imperative, with success, though, naturally, a younger 
one is to be preferred. For broiling, a young bird 
is absolutely indispensable. In choosing a fowl 
always consider the weight in comparison with the 
size. A well-fed bird, in good condition, is always 
heavy in proportion to its size; but here, again, 
beware of exaggeration, for an over-fed, over-fatted 
fowl is generally coarse, and always wasteful, on 
account of the fat which simply goes to swell the 
dripping-pan. The same remarks apply to turkeys. 

Geese and ducks are judged by the colour of their 
bills and feet and the roundness of the breast. If 
the former are yellow and pliable, the bird is young, 
but as they age both bill and feet darken in colour 
till they become orange and almost red. Many 
cooks say that if you squeeze the windpipe close to 
the body, and it gives easily, that the bird will be 
tender ; whereas, if it resists the pressure, the flesh 
will be lough. It must be remembered that the 
excellence of all poultry depends on its feeding, but 
in no class is this more the case than with geese and 
ducks, the latter especially being, if imwatched, 
anvthinor but clean feeders. 

Fowls are in season pretty well all the year round, 
though scarcer in the spring ; chickens are season- 
able through the year, but the so-called " spring 
chickens " are best from March to the end of May. 
Poulardes and capons (especially treated and fed 



POULTRY. 123 

birds, greatlj in request in consequence of their 
superior feeding and size) are obtainable aU the 
year round, though, perhaps, they are at their very 
best in September and October. Turkeys are at 
their best from September to March, after which the 
turkey poults come in about the end of May, and 
last till November. 

Q-eese are accounted in their prime from the 
middle of September (Michaelmas Day, when the 
" stubble geese," fed in the stubble fields after the 
harvest, come in) to about February ; wild ^eese, 
seen in some parts of the country, are in season 
from August to March. Goslings, sometimes called 
'* green geese," come in about February, and are at 
their best from the end of May to the end of July, 
but may be had till the end of August. 

Ducks are in season from August to February, 
«fhilst ducklings come in in February, when they are 
very expensive, and last till the end of July. Wild 
duck are in season from August 1 to March 15. 

Pigeons are in season all the year round. These 
should always be chosen young and fresh, plump 
and fat, and with smooth, supple feet. If the legs 
are rough and dry, they are old ; if the vent be 
green and shrivelled-looking, they are stale, and in 
neither case should they be chosen. 

Guinea-fowl are chosen on the same lines as other 
poultry, and are in season like fowls, all the year 
round. Practically, however, they are mostly in 
season from February to June, being seldom sold 
at any rate, save when game is out, the place of 
which they take on the menu, 



124 IVCEATS. 

For ihe benefit of those who breed their own table- 
fowl, it inay be mentioned that, for table purposes, 
perhaps the best breed is the Dorking, which is 
white-legged, broad-breasted, and possessed of a very 
white and delicate flesh. Next to these, for table 
purposes, come the Cr^vecoeur and the La Fleche, 
both French breeds, and very celebrated in their own 
country, these, however, are black-legged; then 
follow the Houdans, pink-legged and finely -fleshed ; 
next the Game fowl, darker in the flesh and smaller 
in size, but excellently, and almost gamily, flavoured : 
then follow the Langshan, dark-legged, but heavily - 
fleshed, chiefly on the breast ; and, lastly, the 
Brahma, a long-legged creature, once very fashion- 
able, the best parts of which, however, are the 
thighs. These are given as table birds, and, indeed, 
there are more varieties, chiefly local, but these may 
be reckoned the best known and the most generally 
satisfactory. 

Having chosen the fowl, the next thing is to prepare 
it for table. First, in the country at all events, the bird 
must be plucked and singed. This may be considered 
an easy matter, but it is doubtful if the amateur who 
undertakes the task for the first time will quite 
see where the ease comes in ! The skin of birds, 
game especially, is decidedly tender, yet unless the 
feathers, and all the stumps, are carefully removed 
the bird will be unsightly ; while if the skin is torn 
the appearance will be about equally spoilt. For 
this reason, where the skin is unusually tender (as 
it is with long-hung game), many cooks leave the 
hre^at feathers on till the bird has been- trussed. 



POULTRY. 



la 



The proper way of plucking the bird is to bold 1 
in the left hand, and begin plucking under the wing 
carefuUj removing all feathers, but leaving the dowi 
to be Binged off. Ton theu reverse it, and plucl 
down the other side in the eame waj. The nox 




Fig. 1. 



process is to singe the bird, which ie effected b; 
means of a lighted paper, being very careful no 
to bring it so close as to actually singe the bIoe 
Be can^ whilst doing this to remember how tb

126 MEATS. 

that will then be hidden quite free of down, as you 
cannot, as with the rest of the bird, remove the 
overlooked down by re-singeing. The accompany- 
ing illustration (Fig. 1) is the best guide for the 
singeing process. Eemember that singeing is only 
to remove the down, so, if after plucking any 
stumps of feathers are left in, these must be care- 
fully pulled out, not singed off, which will not 
effectually remove them. Many cooks singe their 
poultry, even if trussed by the poulterer, and for 
this purpose pour a little methylated spirit into an 
old tin, light it, and, catching the bird at each end, 
twist it quickly over the flame. 

The fowl being carefully plucked and singed, it 
must next be drawn. For this lay the bird flat on 
its back on the table or a board, cut a slit in the 
skin of the neck, and through this draw out the 
neck and cut it off close to the body, cutting off 
the extra skin so as just to allow a flap of skin 
large enough to cover the opening of the neck. 
You now slip your Angers through this opening 
(some cooks for this cut off the vent and use this 
opening) and draw oat all the inside, carefully 
wiping out the inside and the flap with a cloth. Be 
very careful when doing this not to break anything 
inside, for if by accident the gall bladder should 
burst it will give a bitter taste that only the most 
careful washing out subsequently will remove. The 
next thing is to truss the bird. Scrape the legs well 
after cutting off the claws (scalding them in boiling 
water helps this scraping immensely), remove the 
tips oi the pinions and the spur on the second 



POtTLTRY. 



127 



jtnnt, and twirt each pinion into a triangle, catch- 
ing the tip of the third joint into the first. You 
noir proceed to truss it. This is done either witli 
akewers, or with a string. The first is the ordi- 
nxrj iray, and ia not difficult. For this lay the 
lord on ita back, and pass a skewer through the 
first joint of the wing, drawing the middle of the 




leg close up to it, on the right side, and pass it 
throngb till it catches the wing on the other side, 
eren with the first. Now fasten the neck flap 
mth a small skewer, then put a skewer through 
tjie sMq of the back, on the right side, and 
them through the first joint of the leg; catch 
ttp a small bit of skin and skewer down the left side 
as yon did the right. The bird is now ready for 



12S KEiAVS. 

roasting, unlesB you please to put the well waslie'l 
lirer and ^zzard, one under each wing; but tbis is 
not a fashion to be commended, the liver being 
better disposed of in the way subsequently given. 
This is the ordinary method, but trussing by means 
of a needle and string is much more to be preferred. 
For this, lay the fowl on its back, and drawing both 




fig- 3, 

legs forward towards the neck, you pass a loi^ 
threaded (packing) needle through both thighs, 
under the knee, as in rig. 2 ; now carry this thread 
along the second joint, tjien through the middle of 
the third joint of one wing, then through the back 
under the bone, catching down the flap which has 
been folded down flat on the fowl's back, then bring 
it out through the middle of the third joint and

aloag the aecond joint of the oppoBite win^, as 
shown in Fig. 3 ; now tie np the enda tightly, 
leaving one end longer, by which, when the fowl is 
cooked, you can draw out the whole string. Next 
cut the tendons right through with a clear cut, juat

above the ankle in front and behind, or else cut the 
feet right off altogether at the ankle joint as you 
choose. Anyway, do not let the lege stick out stifE 
and straight a^ seen in second-rate lodging houses. 
Now take the bird in one hand and pass a second 
string through it as in Fig. 4, through the small of 



130 



MEATS. 



tlie back, througli the leg just above the heel, next 
tlirough the skin and under the breastbone, and out 
at the other leg as you did on the other side, 
drawing the string tightly and tieing it as in Fig. 5. 
You then make a small incision in the abdomen, just 
above the vent, through which you pass what cooks 
call " the parson's nose,'* tieing this down with a 
piece of string if it will not remain in position, and 
removing this string with the rest. K you intend 
stuffing your fowl with anything you now put it in, 




Fig. 6. 



stitching down the neck flap to keep all secure, and 
your bird is ready for roasting. For boiling or 
braising the fowl is a little differently trussed. 
Having twisted up the wings in the usual way, make 
a cut through the leg right down to the boue, just 
above the heel as in Fig. 6, in the leg held up, then 
inserting the fingers at the vent, you loosen the flesh 
round the thigh bone, and bending the knee, force 
the leg back under the skin, allowing the heel to 
come through the cut made in the first instance, 



POtrLTEY. 131 

tbus gettintf the leg into ttie position shown in 
Fig. 6 on the right side. This needs great care, as 
it is veiy easy to break the skin in the process, 
which of course destroys the appearance of the bird. 
Having got the legs into this position you run the 
threaded needle through and tie the string as 
preTioualj described. For the second string you 




Vis. 6. 

thread it as for roasting, only remembering to pasa 
it over the foot (see Fig, 7), catching the ankle 
under the skin, and then the end of the breastbone, 
drawing it through on the other side. This trussing 
can be accomplished by anyone who will follow these 
directions carefully, by the help of the illustrations, 
but a little practice wiU be needed before it becomei 
quite an easy matter. 



\'S'l MEATS. 

A turkey is trussed precisely like a fowl, but there 
is one point needing attention, and this is the sinews 
of the legs. These must be carefully removed, or 
the leg will be uneatable. The best way is to hang 
the bird first by one foot and then by the other to a 
hook in the wall, and then jerk it sharply, pulling 
hard on the leg, when the " strings " or sinews will 
give and draw out. Some cooks catch the feet in the 
hinge of the door and then drag at it as before. 




Fig. 7. 

A guinea fowl should be trussed like ordinary 
poultry, though, in some old-fashioned houses, the 
head is left, as was the custom with pheasants, in 
which case the neck is left on ; the head, unplucked 
and carefully wrapped in a buttered paper, is brought 
round under the wing, the bill being laid across the 
breast. In this case a cut must be made in the back 
of the neck to allow of the crop being removed. 

Pigeons should be very carefully plucked and

further advantage of using up birds otherwise too 
tough for the more ordinary forms of cookery. 

Having thus described the processes of trussing, 
a few words may be said on harding and larding. 
The former consists of the application of a slice of 



WW 



^ 




Fig. 8. 



Fig. 9. 



fat bacon cut fairly thin, slitted as in Fig. 8, and 
applied to the breast of the bird, as in Fig. 9. The 
slitting of the bacon is to prevent its curling up as 
it would otherwise do when cooking. 

For larding you cut the lardoons and proceed 




Fig. 10. 

precisely as described in the recipe for fricandeau 
of veal. Fig. 10 shows the larding accomplished. 
These two processes are applied to all dry meat, 
birds especially ; fowls are frequently the better for 
Wing barded, though the^, too, are sometipjeg

larded; bat a gnioea-fowl, said to be one of the 
driest-fleshed birds in existence, can nerer be cooked 
without the adoption of one or other of these two 
processes. 




Fig.lU 



Besides these hints, all that remains to be said of 
poultry generallj concerns the preparation of birds 
for fricass^, &c., and their boning. 

Regarding the first, it is safe to saj that most 
cooks will consider anj directions as at least snper-

simple a proceeding there is a right as well as a 
wrong way, and it is well to show the housewife, at 
least, the correct method. 

To carve a roast fowl is, to some persons at *ili 
events, a matter of difl&cnlty, but the novice at 
cooking will find that to cut up a fowl when r^w, is 
an even stiffer task. Yet, unless the process is carried 
out successfully and tidily, good-bye to the appear-

economical. I have seen an unsuccessful carver 
after herculean efforts, sufficient one would have 
thought to dismember a mastodon, much less a poor 
little chicken, produce four joints from the bird ! 
Yet properly cut up the same fowl would have easily 
resulted in twelve, if not fourteen decent helpings. 
Rather a difference in the housekeeper's eyes. To 
begin with, after properly plucking and singeing 



POULTRY. 



137 



your fowl, lay it on its side on a table, and as in 
Fig. 11, hold the th^h and the leg together in your 
left hand, and cut right through to the socket of the 
thigh bone with a sharp cook's knife ; then pull the 
leg back with your left hand, disengaging the thigh 
from the socket, cut the skin round neatly, and put

this joint aside. The other leg is obviously treated 
in the same way. Next cut off the head and neck 
close to the body, and proceed to remore the winga

for the other -wing. Now hold the bird firmly with

can obviously be cut into two or even three pieces 
as may be required. Ton next treat the 1

pieces look as in Fig. 16. The wing is then cut into

soon make this division easy, but some knack is needed 
in diriding the joints, "Use a fairly heavy knife (g.

CHAPTER IX. 

POULTRY (Continued). 

Poultry takes, on an average, fifteen minutes per 
pound and fifteen minutes over for roasting, though, 
of course, due allowance must be made for the size 
of the bird, as a full grown fowl (and much more a 
turkey) will take decidedly longer to cook through 
than a small chicken, even when the time has been 
correctly proportioned to the weight, so judgment 
must be used. It must also be remembered that a little 
longer time is allowed when birds are cooked in the 
oven, on account of the delay in opening the oven 
door, and drawing out the meat to baste it, <fec., 
which, of course, interrupts the cooking. 

Fowlj to roast. — Choose a nice plump fowl that 
has hung for one or two days, place a medium 
onion and a lump of salt butter, of the san:e size, 
inside it, then rub the bird all over with good 
clarified dripping, cover the breast with a large harde 
of fat bacon, or wrap the bird up in white paper 
])revioiisly rubbed all over with butter or clarified 
dripping, as you please, and roast in front of the fire. 



POULTRY. 145 

or in the oven, for twenty- five to thirty minutes, 
being careful to keep it well basted all the time. 
Then remove the skewers or strings, set it on a very 
hot dish, and serve garnished with well washed and 
picked watercress, liberally sprinkled with oil and 
vinegar, season with salt and pepper, and send 
to table with gravy and breadsauce in a boat. Of 
course cooked in this way there is no " liver wing," 
but a great improvement is to put the liver inside 
with the onion and butter, and allow it to cook thus, 
when you can serve slices of it with each helping of 
fowl. 

A turkey is roasted in exactly the same way, 
only the bird is generally stuffed, a delicate sausage 
meat and chestnut stuffing being put inside the 
bird, whilst the crop is stuffed with a good herb 
forcemeat. For this allow (for a good sized 
bird) ilb. of freshly grated breadcrumbs, 4oz. 
finely minced suet freed from skin, &c., two table- 
spoonfuls of minced herbs, a little salt, white and 
coralline pepper, and four whole eggs ; work this all 
to a smooth forcemeat, and use. For the sausage 
and chestnut stuffing remove the skin from 21b. of 
nice sausages (or use 21b. of sausage meat), mixing 
this with the bird's liver ; make a chestnut farce 
thus : cut the tops from 21b. to 31b. of good chest- 
nuts, and bake them for fifteen minutes ; now peel 
them perfectly and lay them in a pan with enough 
common stock to cover them, bring this all to the 
boil, then draw it aside and let it all simmer till the 
nuts are tender, and have absorbed all the liquid 
(they should be covered whilst cooking with a 

I. 



146 MEATS. 

buttered paper), then rub thein through a fine wire 
sieve, mix with them a small piece of butter, a pinch 
of sugar, and a dust of coralline pepper, and use. 
Part of this purde can be sent to the table in a 
vegetable dish, the rest being introduced into the 
body of the bird in alternate layers with the sausage 
farce. Some people omit the sausage meat and mix 
the chestnuts with a little fat bacon cut into dice, 
and fried. Turkey cooked thus can be either served 
like the roast fowl, or it may be served with any rich 
sauce and garnish to taste. Capons and poulards 
are excellent treated in this way. 

Guinea fowl is cooked exactly like roast fowl, but 
the barding, or larding, is absolutely imperative. 
It takes from twenty to twenty-five minutes or 
upwards, according to size, and it must be borne in 
mind that careful and plentiful basting is indis- 
pensable from the first, for this bird is very dry of 
itself, and if once allowed to get dry whilst cooking, 
it is all but, if not quite, impossible to remedy this 
by subsequent attention. 

Espagnole, soubise, egg, oyster, and many other 
sauces may be served with either roast fowl or 
guinea fowl, instead of its own gravy, if liked. 

Boast Goose, — After cleansing and trussing as 
advised above, this bird is stuffed, well rubbed over 
with dripping, or wrapped in a buttered or greased 
paper, and roasted or baked for three-quarters of an 
hour upwards, according to size. It must be well 
basted and carefully roasted, as it should be a 
delicate golden colour when cooked. It is then 
served with a good marmalade of apples (or apple 



POULTRY. 147 

sauce) and clear gravy in a boat. For the apple 
sauce, peel, core, and slice lib. of good cooking apples, 
and put them in a pan with half a pint of water, 
l^oz. caster sugar, and about loz. of butter, cook till 
it is all quite tender, then sieve, re-heat and serve. 
For the stuffing the ordinary process is to chop up 
raw onion, sage, and some parboiled potato, with a 
little minced suet, pepper, and salt, in proportions 
suited to the consumer's taste, but this happy-go- 
lucky method has the disadvantage of frequently 
disagreeing veiy decidedly with the said consumer's 
digestion, so the following method may be recom- 
mended : — 

Blanch four fair-sized onions for five minutes, 
then drain off the water and replace it with fresh ; 
watch this re-boil, then return the onions to the pan, 
let them just boil up, and now dimmer them slowly 
and gently till tender. Meanwhile blanch eight or 
ten nice fresJi sage leaves in boiling water for five 
minutes, then dry them carefully, and add them to 
the onions (when tender and also dry), and mince 
them together very finely. Now mix 6oz. freshly 
grated breadcrumbs to this, dust liberally with 
quatre epices, and, if liked, a squeeze of lemon juice, 
and, when it is all well blended, work into it 2oz. 
fresh beef suet chopped, and, lastly, two whole eggs, 
and use. This will be found far more delicate and 
digestible than tne usual stuffing, the rawness of 
which is often most unpleasant. Green geese, though 
roasted, are not usually stuffed. Ducks are roasted 
and stuffed precisely like geese, or the stuffing may, 
ii liked, be omitted. Serve with clear brown gravy 

1.2 



148 MEATS. 

and apple sauce, or send to table unstuffed, with 
a garnish of seasoned watercress and gravy in a boat. 
They will take from twenty-five minutes upwards 
according to size. 

Chicken boiled. — ** Chicken boiled is chicken 
spoiled " is an old saying, also quoted with regard 
to turkeys ; at the same time, if carefully boiled, a 
fowl is often a very tempting dish. Wash the bird 
nicely in lukewarm water and, when trussed, rub it 
well all over (on the breast especially) with a lemon, 
then wrap it in a buttered paper and next in a floured 
cloth. Bring some water, slightly salted, all but to 
the boil, then lay in the fowl, watch the water re- 
boil, when you draw the pan to the side and let it 
simmer slowly till the fowl is done, remembering^ 
that the slower it cooks the tenderer it will be. It 
will take from twenty to twenty-five minutes upwards. 
It is then lifted out of its wrappings, set on a hot 
dish, and served with its sauce poured over it, and 
any garnish to taste. Bechamel, celery, oyster, 
parsley, or mushroom sauce may be served over and 
around it. 

A fancy of the moment is to serve a rich bechamel 
or allemande sauce with boiled or stewed fowl, using 
the liquor obtained by boiling down the heads, &c., 
of some shrimps for the sauce, the fish itself, 
together with cooked asparagus points, being heated 
in the sauce and served with it. 

In France an extremely succulent method of 
serving a not over young fowl is as poule-au-pot, 
when the bird is carefully trussed as for boiling, and 
laid into the stock pot, or the pot au feu, when the 



POTTLT&Y. 140 

latter has been carefully skimmed and the vegetables 
added ; the fowl being allowed to cook very gently 
in the stock till done, when it is lifted out and served 
on a hot dish, with a garnish of vegetables, &c. K 
a little coarse salt is strewed over it when dished, it 
is known as pouLe au gros sel ; if again you cook about 
12oz. of well washed rice in a little of the stock in 
which the fowl was cooked, then carefully free it 
from fat, stir into it a little salt and freshly ground 
black pepper and a morsel of butter, and dish the 
fowl on this with a little of the steck as gravy, it 
becomes poule au riz. This method of cooking a 
fowl has this advantage, that it adds strength te the 
soup without losing any flavour of its own. 

Turkeys may be boiled precisely like fowls, of 
course taking a somewhat longer time te cook. 
Both are improved by boiling a head of celery, two 
or three sliced carrots, a bunch of herbs, and an 
onion stuck with one or two cloves, with the bird. 
A delicate celery or onion sauce is on such occasions 
the usual accompaniment. Again, turkey, like other 
poultry, may be braised, formerly effected by stewing 
the bird in a pan which had a lid strong enough to 
hold red-hot embers, i.e., braise, but is now done by 
placing the pan in the oven with heat top and 
bottom. Truss the bird as for boiling (an oldish 
bird may be used for this dish), after stuffing it to 
taste, bard it, and wrap it in a buttered or greased 
paper. Place a fairly thick layer of sliced soup 
vegetables (carrot, celery, onion — one stuck with two 
or three cloves), a good bouquet, some slices of 
smoked ham, veal, the giblets, half a calf's f oot^ or Ul<^ 



l50 MEATS. 

well scraped rind of some bacon, as taste and conveni- 
ence dictate ; season with salt, and some peppercorns, 
and pour in about one and a half pints of good bone 
or poultry stock, and about half a pint of light white 
wine (or failing this put a good wineglassful of 
sherry or Marsala in a small tumbler, add the juice 
of haK a lemon, fill up nearly to the top of the 
tumbler with water and use), and if liked a table- 
spoonful of brandy. This is not needed if sherry is 
used. Cover down closely, bring it to the boil, then 
only allow it to simmer, gently but steadily, till the 
bird is cooked, turning it over once or twice in the 
process. The length of time it will take depends on 
the size and age of the bird, and the cook ; from two 
to five hours being the extreme limits ; but it cannot 
be too strongly impressed on the cook that the 
slower the fowl is cooked the more excellent will it 
be on the table. Elderly fowls, and, indeed, any kind 
of poultry are cooked thus with advantage. If to be 
eaten cold (when it is particularly delicious), lift the 
pan from the fire, and turn its contents out into an 
earthenware pan and allow them all to grow cold 
together. If to be eaten hot, remove the paper and 
barding bacon, and place it in a baking tin with 
about haK a pint of its gravy and set it in the oven 
for about eight or ten minutes to glaze, keepmg it 
well basted during the process. Meanwhile strain 
the rest of the gravy, free it from fat, boil it up 
sharply to reduce it slightly, and send to table either 
separately or over and round the bird. A turkey 
cooked thus is, abroad, called en dauhe, and the 
process is applied to almost any kind of meat. 



POULTRY. 151 

Braised turkey or capon may be served with a 
variety of garnish, from which it takes its name. 

Pigeons, especially Bordeaux pigeons, are excellent 
roasted. They should be barded, and roasted for 
twelve to fifteen minutes, being carefully and fre- 
quently basted. Then remove the trussing strings 
or skewers, and" he bacon, and set for a moment or 
two in front of the fire to brown ; then replace the 
bacon and dish on a ^ hot plate, garnish with 
seasoned watercress, and serve with clear gravy, or 
any sauce to taste in a separate boat. 

Poulet a Vltalienne, — For this shred finely an onion, 
the red part of a carrot, and a rasher of bacon, and 
fry these in an ounce of butter till nicely browned ; 
now add the giblets of the fowl, cut up, and fry for 
a few minutes longer, then moisten with half a pint 
of stock of any kind, season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and, if liked, a tiny pinch of saffron, bring 
it sharply to the boil, when you add in 4oz. or so of 
rice, and stir and boil fast till nearly cooked ; then 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of tomato sauce or 
puree, and three of grated cheese ; stir this well 
together, and let it all cool down, when you use it to 
stuff the fowl, which is then finished off as in 
braised turkey. The latter bird is excellent done 
this way, but will require fully double as much of 
the rice stuffing. N.B. — It must be remembered 
that any recipe given for fowls can be utilised for 
turkeys, and, indeed, in parts where game is abund- 
ant, also for old game of any kind. 

Poulet aux asperges, — This is a good way of utilis- 
ing an old fowl. Truss it for boiling, and put it in a 



152 MEATS. 

pan with a quart of cold water, a teaspoonful of 
salt, a slice of celery root, and one moderate leek. 
Bring it all to the boil, then skim carefully, after 
which draw it to the side of the stove ; only allow it 
to simmer, as gently as possible, till the fowl is 
tender, then lift out the bird and keep it hot (but 
without drying it) ; meanwhile strain the liquor in 
which it cooked, and in it cook some nice green 
asparagus (or only the tips), previously blanched for 
five minutes in boiling salted water ; when these are 
cooked dish the fowl neatly, with a little of its own 
gravy, and the asparagus round it, and send to table 
with chervil sauce in a boat. For this you make 
rather rich melted butter, using half milk, half 
stock — of that in which the fowl was cooked — say one- 
third of a pint of each, for an ounce of butter and 
a dessertspoonful of sifted flour ; add to this when 
well blended a teaspoonful of finely chopped chervil, 
boil for four or five minutes, and serve. The liquor 
in which the fowl is cooked should be carefully 
saved, as if freed from fat, and garnished with any 
of the asparagus left over, and heated, it makes a 
delicate and tempting broth. 

Poulet au jus, — Truss the bird as for roasting, 
with the liver, &c., inside as previously recommended, 
and bard it neatly ; lay into a stewpan about loz. of 
butter, and the fowl, and allow it to fry till nicely 
browned, when you pour in rather less than a giU of 
good stock, with a seasoning of salt and pepper, 
cover the pan down closely, weighting it to prevent 
the escape of the steam, and cook it very gently for 
one and a half hours, turning it over once during 



POULTRY. 153 

the process, as quicklv as possible : now put it on a 
hot dish, remoTe any fat, and keep it hot. Pour a 
couple of spoonfuls more of stock into the stewpan, 
and leave it on the fire for a minute or so, shaking 
it gently to detach all the gravy adhering to the 
pan, then strain it over the bird and serve very hot. 
For this the fowl must be young. 

Poulet a la Peau de Goret. — Boast the fowl as 
usual, being careful about the basting. When 
nearly cooked, run a piece of fat bacon, wrapped in 
paper, on a skewer, set light to the paper, which, as 
it bums, will melt the bacon fat, and the drip of this 
on to the fowls will brown the skin and raise blisters 
such as one sees on roast sucking pig. Serve very 
hot with a watercress salad, and either tiny sausages 
or rolls of fried bacon. 

Potdeta a la Chivry. — ^Truss and braise the fowls, 
using ham instead of bacon, and very rich stock, 
with, if at hand, truffle trimmings; braise these 
very gently, and when cooked, dish on a hot dish 
and serve with a ravigotte sauce. For this take a 
couple of ounces of rich white roux, and moisten it 
with about half a pint each of poultry stock and 
light white wine (not sherry), let it all reduce till 
smooth and thick, then add a seasoning of lemon 
juice, salt, and white pepper, with either an ounce or 
two of Eavigotte butter, or parsley, chervil, chives 
(or shallot), tarragon, and watercress, in equal 
proportions (previously blanched for two or three 
minutes in boiling water, then dried by wringing 
them in a clean cloth), finely minced, stir it all over 
the fire till hot, but without boiling, and use. 



154 MEATS. 

Bavigotte butter is made in the same way, only 
when minced the herbs are pounded with one 
anchovy and loz. or so of butter for each heaping 
spoonful of the herbs. 

Poulets aiix Tomatea, — Eemove the breast bones 
from the birds, and place in each a good lump of 
maitre d^hotel hutter (3oz. of butter mixed with the 
juice of a lemon, a tablespoonful of blanched and 
minced parsley, with a seasoning of salt and white 
pepper), bard the fowls first with sliced lemon, then 
with fat bacon or a buttered paper, and braise them 
gently till cooked. They will take about three- 
quarters of an hour. Now lift them out, remove 
the paper and the lemon, wipe the breasts of the 
birds with a clean cloth, dish and serve with a well- 
coloured tomato sauce all round them. The beauty 
of the dish depends on the whiteness of the fowls 
and the rich colour of the tomatoes. 

Poulets Truffea aux HuUres, — Roast a couple of nice 
fowls till nearly done, keeping them wrapped in 
buttered paper aU the time to ensure their whiteness, 
then when cooked place inside the birds a good pat 
of butter mixed with truffles cut into dice, some 
halved oysters, minced parsley, and a tiny morsel of 
finely minced shallot, or a few minced chives ; now 
butter a stewpan, line it with sliced truffles, fine 
herbs (chives, parsley, and a mushroom or two all 
minced), and lastly some bearded oysters, previously 
just blanched in their own liquor ; then more truffles 
and fine herbs, sprinkle this all with best salad oil or 
oiled butter, and lastly, lay the fowls on this, and 
leave them for ten minutes to cook very gently over 



POlTLTRr. 15

a dear low fire ; then lift the birds on to a hot dish, 
garnish with the truffles and the herbs and keep 
hot ; meanwhile pour into the pan half a glass of white 
wine and a little strained stock (in which you have 
boiled the beards of the oysters), let it just boil up, 
skim, add the strained juice of a lemon, and strain 
over the fowls. This is a somewhat expensive dish, 
but is well worth a trial on occasions. 

Chapon Truffe. — This, again, is a costly dish, though, 
like the preceding, is well worth a trial. The simplest 
way is to order the bird, ready stuffed, from one or 
other of the excellent French charcutiers to be found 
in town, but if this is not convenient, here is the 
proper method : Choose a fine tender young capon, 
or, failing this, a plump young hen turkey, either 
being freshly killed. Now take IJlb. of fresh 
truffles, carefully rejecting any that look or smell 
mouldy; well wash and scrub them with a soft 
brush until perfectly free from the least trace of 
sand or grit, then trim rather more than half the 
truffles neatly into even shapes, as large as the 
truffles will admit of ; meanwhile pound the trim- 
mings of these with the rest of the truffles in a 
mortar to a smooth paste with an equal weight of fat 
bacon (previously rasped finely) ; season with pepper 
and salt, using freshly ground black pepper by 
preference, and when this farce is quite smooth mix 
in the whole truffles and stuff the bird with it. Let 
it hang for five or six days before cooking it, to 
ensure the flesh being thoroughly penetrated, or, as 
French cooks say, " perfumed," with the aroma of the 
truffles. When to be cooked, truss as for roasting, 



156 MEATS. 

bard with a generous slice of fat bacon, covering 
this again with a well-buttered sheet of paper, and 
roast as usual, only being especially careful as to 
the frequency and liberality of the basting all the 
time of cooking. A bird thus stuffed requires, 
properly speaking, no sauce beyond its own gravy, 
as it is too rich and highly flavoured of itself to need 
outside flavours. 

Poulet a la Montmorency (or fowl fricandeau). — 
Pluck, singe, and bone a nice fowl, and have ready a 
stuffing made of a small sweetbread cut into dice, 
a small tin of pate de foie gras, some sliced truffles 
or mushrooms, about half as much rasped bacon as 
you have foie gras, a shallot or two, or some chives, 
and parsley, all finely minced, freshly ground black 
pepper, a little salt, and one or more egg yolks to 
bind it nicely. Stuff the fowl with this forcemeat, 
sew it up, and fry a few minutes in butter to brown 
it lightly, then lard it neatly like a fricandeau, and 
finish it off in the same way. If to be served hot, 
reduce some of its own liquor to a glaze, paint this 
thickly over the bird and set it in the oven for a few 
minutes to crisp, and serve alone, or with any sauce 
to taste. K to be used cold, turn it into a basin 
with all its gravy and addenda, and leave till 
perfectly cold, when the fat is wiped ofE and the 
whole is painted over with dark coloured aspic ; or 
its own liquor is reduced, mixed with leaf gelatine 
(|oz. to a pint of liquid), and cleared with an egg 
white and shell, and used as glaze. Chopped aspic 
is used with this as a garnish.

side of the fire slowly and steadily for one and a half 
hours, by which time the fowl should be as tender as 
possible. Remove the bouquet, skim off as much 
of the fat as may be, cut the bird up neatly, replace 
in the pan, and sei*ve very hot in the casserole. If 
you have no casserole, use an iron saucepan, and when 
about to serve, dish the fowl either on a fried crouton, 
or a very hot dish, with its accompaniments, saving 
the bouquet, and most of the fat in the sauce. This 
is a French recipe ; we, however, stew with the fowl 
small fingers of ham or bacon, or sausages, according 
to what we have, and mushrooms when they are 
plentiful. One great advantage of this dish is that 
it may be kept slowly simmering at the side of the 
stove for an almost indefinite time, if for any reason 
dinner is delayed, without deterioration. It is also 
an excellent dish for "the hill," or for a skating 
party. 

Poulet a la Turquc. — Truss an old fowl as for 
boiling, and put it with about a quart of second 
stock, into a saucepan, together with an onion stuck 
with two or three cloves, and two bay leaves, and 
about 6oz. or 7oz. of rice tied up loosely in a bit of 
muslin; braise gently under a buttered paper till 
both fowl and rice are cooked, then keep the fowl 
hot ; but put the rice, after well draining it, into 
another pan with an ounce of butter (or even clarified 
dripping), a tiny pinch of saffron, and about a 
handful of sultanas, previously swelled in the stock 
in which the fowl was cooked. Toss this all over the 
fire till hot, adding a little butter to prevent its dry- 
ing too much ; then dish it round the fowl, pouring 



POULTRY. 159 

over it enough of the liquor in which the fowl was 
cooked (freed from fat) to make it moist, but not 
sloppy, and serve very hot. All sorts of variantes 
may be found for this dish ; for instance, the raisins 
are replaced by stoned olives, or quartered tomatoes, 
or green chillies when available, or red chillies (from 
the pickle bottle) are used, and even a curry sauce 
is used instead of the traditional fowl liquor, but, 
though appetising, these are not really strictly 
correct. N,B. — Neck of mutton cooked in this way 
is a dish not to be despised. 

Fowl Pot-roast (a Cape dish). — Truss the fowl 
when plucked and singed as for roasting (do not 
forget to put the liver, with a piece of butter and 
seasoning to taste, inside the bird), then place it, 
breast downwards, in a baking pot (alias a casserole), 
with half a pint of water and some butter or drip- 
ping ; cover down the pot, and leave the bird to cook 
gently for an hour ; then turn it, add some more fat 
or dripping, and a wineglassful of wine, cover with a 
buttered paper, close down, and place live embers on 
the lid of the pan (or set it in the oven with top and 
bottom heat), and let it cook till the bird is nicely 
browned, when it is dished with a garnish of fried 
bacon and some breadsauce. It will take about one 
and a half hours to cook, and first and last you 
should use about loz. of fat, whether butter or drip- 
ping. If young fowls are used for this, little or no 
water is required. 

Old Fowl to Cooh. — Lastly it may be as well to 
give a method of utilising an old fowl. It need 
hardly be said that, where obtainable, young birds 



160 MEATS. 

are to be preferred, but this is not always possible, so 
the following may come in useful : Truss the bird 
carefully, according to its ultimate cooking, whether 
roast, boiled, &c., and place it in sufficient stock (or 
even water) to cover it ; watch this reboil, then draw 
the pan to the side, and let the whole simmer very 
slowly and gently for several hours (from three 
hours upwards, according to the age of the bird), 
then turn it into an earthenware Yiasin with its 
gravy, and leave it till the next day. It may then be 
gently roasted, or, preferably, stowed with tomatoes, 
rice, or any vegetables (tomatoes and green peppers 
are specially to be commended), or it may be cut up 
and made into a capilotade, a fricassee, or a pie, as 
you please. For the second cooking it will take 
precisely the same time as would a young fowl. But 
remember the whole success depends on its being 
only simmered the first day ; if once allowed to boil, 
it will simply harden into boot leather. 

Oooae a VEstouffade. — As said l)efore, goose may 
be roasted, it may even be boiled, according to the 
rules given for fowls, and certainly can be braised 
by the directions already given, a little attention 
being paid to the seasoning, <&c. The following will 
give a good idea of the method, which incidentally 
also applies to ducks. Stuff the goose with the sage 
and onion stuffing previously rocommended, and 
truss it like a duck for boiling. Now line a fairly 
deep stewpan with half a pound of butter, a sliced 
carrot or two, an onion stuck with two or three 
cloves, some good turnips, and a good bunch of 
parsley. Lay the goose on this, and moisten it with 



POULTRY. 161 

about one and a lialf gills of sherry, or the same 
amount of brandj and water (two parts brandj to 
one of water), place it over a slow fire, and let it 
stew rery gently (for about one and a half honrs for 
a medinm and young bird, but considerably longer 
for a larger and old goose), turning and basting it 
constantly to get it equally browned all OTer. When 
cooked, pour off the butter, lift the bird on to a 
baking tin, rednce a little of the Hqnor to a glaze by 
rapid boiling, brush this orer the goose, and let it 
glaze and crisp in the oren for eight or ten minutes. 
Meantime strain the liquor, add to it (after well 
skimming it) one and a half gills of brown sauce, 
with the juice of half a lemon ; boil it np sharply, 
let it reduce a little to thicken it, then dish the bird 
with the braised turnips as a garnish, and pour the 
sauce round it all, and send to table with either 
apple sance or apple comp6te. 

Canekms aux olives. — Truss the birds for boiling, 
and put them in a stewpan with a pint of good 
stock, a sliced carrot, an onion stuck with two or 
more cloves, and a good bouquet (thyme, parsley, 
bayleaf, marjoram, green onions, and thinly pared 
lemon rind) ; cover with a buttered paper, bring it 
to the boil, then draw it aside and let it stew very 
gently for about one hour and a quarter, after which ^ 
lift the birds out and glaze as with the goose in the 
preceding recipe. Meanwhile strain the liquor, free 
it from fat, mix it with about one and a half gills 
of good espagnole sauce, and abont two or three 
dozen turned (or stoned) olives, let this boil up 
sharply for a minute or two to reduce it slightly. 



162 MEATS. 

then pour it round the ducks and serve very hot. 
Many people let the stones of the olives stew with 
the ducks. Eemember ducklings need no stuffing. 
Canetons aux navetSf cooked precisely like the goose 
a Vestouffade, are particularly good, only the sage 
and onion must of course be omitted. 

It is manifestly impossible, in a book of this size, 
to give all the ways in which poultry can be served, 
so that one can only trust that any intelligent cook 
who has mastered the preceding recipes will see her 
way to evolving varieties for herself, a plan followed 
by all good foreign cooks. One point more before 
this chapter is concluded, and that is, watercress 
salad. Few garnishes are less expensive than this 
one, but few are nicer, whilst the improvement it 
makes in the appearance of a dish needs no telling. 
Well wash the cress, dry it nicely, then sprinkle it 
generously with oil, sparingly with vinegar (plain, 
chili, or tarragon, to taste), a dust of salt and coral- 
line or freshly ground black pepper, and use. 



CHAPTER X. 

GAME. 

As a general principle, the ] lainer the fashion of 
cooking the better is game liked, and well hung and 
properly roasted British game, at all events, will 
compare most favourably with even the culinary 
efforts of good foreign chefs and foreign fashions ; 
and usually anything like a good cook, in England, 
may be safely trusted to roast her game properly. 

The first question with regard to game of all kinds 
is the hanging; for it may be accepted that for 
most people fresh game is little, if at all, superior to 
ordinary poultry. Still there is a medium in all 
things, and it must be admitted that a good many 
persons in their anxiety to obtain the requisite hau 
gout for their pheasants, &c., run perilously near 
losing their birds altogether through decomposition. 
A great deal naturally depends on the larder or 
keeping place. A cool, shady, and airy situation 
should always if possible be selected, and if a draught 
is obtainable, so much the better. In the country 
a hanging safe with perforated zinc sides, appended 

M 2 



1(54 MEATS. 

to a shad J tree (a walnut for choice), is most 
admirable, but of course a sheltered comer must be 
fixed upon. Remember the great bugbear of the 
game-hanging housekeeper is damp ; in cold, fresh , 
airy weather properly cared-for game of all kinds 
will hang almost indefinitely, but the least damp, 
especially the class of weather known as " muggy ** 
by cooks, will ruin it. Remember also that there is 
a right and a wrong way of hanging birds. If these 
are hung up " anyhow," or huddled together so that 



Fig. 21. 





Fig. 22. 

the par cannot get freely round them, and one bird 
rests on the other, they will not " hang " at all, but 
will, to speak plainly, simply go bad from the 
moment they are put into the larder. Personally, 
I prefer a long back passage with doors at both 
ends, and in the ceiling of this hooks fixed, from which 
depend the meat-hooks known as " S hooks," and on 
the lower point of one of these the bird is fixed by his 
chin. Where, however, a good deal of game has to 
be provided for, it is well worth while getting the 



GAME. 165 

patent books to be procured at most good iron- 
mongers. Fig. 21 sbows tbe ordinary "S book'* 
fastened to a ring from tbe ceiling. Pig. 22 sbows 
tbe quadruple and double books, tbe first bolding four, 
tbe second two birds, bung by tbeir necks, wbicb 
are slipped into tbe forks a a, and are tbus kept 
separate witbout risk of any contact between tbem. 
Tbese books may obviously be fixed anywbere, and 
bave tbe furtbpr advantage tbat tbey can be rendered 
fly-proof by tbe use of tbe booped muslin bags (also 
procurable for a few pence at most ironmongers) 
wbicb can be bad in varying sizes. As an average, 
pbeasants sbould bang from ten to fourteen days in 
good weatber,but if tbe weatber turns close and moist 
you will find care required at tbe end of a very few 
days ; wbilst skilful cooks, witb a good larder, will 
keep tbe birds for tbree weeks and even more. 
Indeed, it is recorded of a gourmet in tbe Midlands, 
tbat on one occasion be astonisbed bis guests by 
producing at dinner a brace of pbeasants at Easter. 
His well-known cbaracter precluded tbe least idea of 
any trickery connected witb tbeir appearance, but as 
be observe!, "Easter is very early tbis year, tbe 
birds were sbot on tbe last permissible day, and my 
larder is Al ! " Tbis, of course, was long before 
tbe days of freezing cbambers, &c. Tbis very year, 
in tbe montb of June, grouse were eaten in prime 
condition wbicb bad left tbeir native moors on 
Dec. 18, 1899. But tbey owed tbeir excellence to

kind, generally known as the red-leg partridge, 
require hanging nearly a third longer than the 
indigenous grey bird, if it is to have a good flavour 
and tender fl ^sh. But remember in this, as in all 
cases, no game bird will taste appreciably ** high " 
when cooked unless it has been hung long enough to 
become, whilst raw, distinctly, if only slightly, 
offensive. In fact the tales most cooks couli tell, 
an' they would, of the state of game before it is 
cooked, which yet me3ts with approval at table, 
would make a good many people inclined to forswear 
such viands for ever and a dav. To know when a 
bird is pr jpsrly fit to cook, notice first the condition 
of the eyes : if deeply sunk, the bird has been 
killed for several days ; if, whsn the lids are lifted, the 
eyes are bright and full, not more than two, or three 
at the utmost, have elapsed since it was shot. Next, 
if a feather can be pulled from the tail or the lower 
part of the back without resistance, the bird is 
sufficiently hung for all practical purposes, and will 
be quite tender ; if, however, on blowing up the 
feathers on the lower part of the breast, the flesh has 
a distinctly green tinge, the sooner that bird is 
cooked the better for all concerned. Eemember the 
brighter and smoother the plumage the better is the 
probable condition of the bird. Those that have 
been shattered by shot, or have, by any accident, 
been allowed to get wet in any way, or have been 
packed closily for some time, should always be 
cooked first, for they will not keep satisfactorily, and 
if you are buying game, avoid such scrupulously. 
Otherwise, the test for ^ame is pretty much the saia^ 



GAME. 107 

as for poTiitry. One test much favoured by experi- 
enced cooks is to take tlie bird by the h)w<jr man- 
dible of the beak, and hold it out straight ; if old, it 
will remain stiff and straight ; if youu^, thu bi^ak 
will give way and bend in the middle. The name 
rules apply to grouse and moor fowl ^entjrally, 
though, as a rule, they will hang longer than tlie 
fatter-fleshed low-country birds. For iuHtaucti, q 
pheasant from the Eastern counties, as carefully fed 
as the barndoor poultry, will not keep half a« long 
as the same bird which has skirmished for a liveli- 
hood on a Scotch moor, though, exjjerto crede, the 
difference of flavour between the two birds in won- 
derful. Woodcock, snij>e, and plover do not keep 
well, as they are undrawn and sent to the ta))le 
with the " trail," as it is technically called. Wild 
duck also, of all kinds, will only hang a few days. 

Pheasant to Uoast. — Truss like a fowl for roasting, 
though some persons like the unplucked head kept 
on, when it should be carefully wrap|>ed in buttered 
paper all the time of cooking, the i^f>er being only 
removed when the bird is dished. In this case a 
few of the tail feathers are aUo restored at the same 
time. But thiu is rather old-fa«hioned nowadays, 
and is, in any case, a troublesome fanfy for the 
carver. Most cooks nowadays l^rd the bird with 
a slice of shtted bacon, removing this just at 
least for a minute or two to brown the bird, repla/> 
ing it (or not' afterwards, as taste dictates. This 
barding is indispensable when, as in the present day, 
baking so often has to replace roasting. Onje jx/int 
is imperatrve, and that is the neoessitjf lor <^\v^^6xsi^

and generous basting. Wlien cooked, put the bird 
at once on a hot dish (with or without a neatly- 
trimmed and fried crouton as jou please), garnish 
with watercress salad, and send to table with bread 
sauce and browned breadcrumbs, and gravy to taste 
separately. For the bread sauce boil haK a pint or 
so of milk with a few peppercorns, a spray of parsley, 
an onion stuck with a clove (or preferably two or 
three young green onions), till well flavoured; then 
strain it, boiling, on to 6oz. freshly-grated white 
breadcrumbs; cover down the pan closely, and let 
it stand on the side of the stove till the bread has 
absorbed all the milk ; then lift out the onion and 
the parsley, and beat the bread to a smooth pap 
with a silver fork, let it just boil up, stirring all the 
time to prevent its burning; now add two good 
tablespoonsful of cream or new milk, a seasoning of 
salt and pepper, and serve very hot. Some cooks 
add mace and nutmeg to this sauce, but these spices 
are both so strongly flavoured that it is wise to ascer- 
tain first if they are liked, as, if not liked, they are 
usually intensely c^isliked. For the breadcrumbs, 
take some previously dried and sifted breadcrumbs 
(these should always be at hand in a soigne kitchen, 
in wide-mouthed stoppered bottles, either white or 
brown, the colouring being simply a matter of length 
in baking) and place them in a hot baking dish with 
an ounce or two of either butter or delicately clarified 
dripping, and let them bake very gently, stirring 
them constantly to avoid burning till the crumbs 
have absorbed all the fat and are dry and crisp. 
For the gi'av^, prepare stock i|i tl^^ ordinary way 



GAME. 169 

with game bones (failing these, use poultry bones or 
stock and the trimmings and giblets of the bird in 
question, with seasoning, a good bouquet, an onion, 
and a carrot) ; remove all the fat from this, strain, 
lightly reduce, and serve in a well-scalded sauce 
tureen or boat. 

In Scotland melted butter is often served with 
3 grouse or black game, instead of bread sauce, cran- 
berry or rowanberry jelly sauce also finding admirers. 
For ordinary purposes roasting is the usual method 
of treating all these birds, but where game is plenti- 
ful, variety is charming; and, moreover, old birds 
have to be disposed of, and for these reasons a few 
separate recipes are given. 

Faisan a la Gitana. — Truss the bird like a fowl 
for boiling, then lay it into a stewpan with 8oz. or 
9oz. of streaky bacon or ham, cut into strips, and 
an ounce of butter or clarified dripping. Toss the 
bird over the fire till nicely browned all over, then 
pour ofE as much of the fat as possible without 
losing the gravy, add to it either two or three sliced 
Portugal onions, or four or five minced shallots, the 
pulp of six or seven tomatoes, a bunch of herbs, and 
a gill of sherry ; cover down closely, and simmer it 
all gently for forty-five to fifty minutes, basting fre- 
quently. Add a seasoning of salt and pepper, 
remove the herbs, place on a very hot dish, and 
serve with the tomato, <fec. If not disliked, a cut clove 
of garlic rubbed three or four times across the stew- 
pan in which it is cooked adds greatly to the 
flavour. Abroad, a fried crouton, delicately spread 
with £1* savoury butter of some kind, is ofteu di&l^^

under the bird. Almost needless to say, fowls may 
be cooked by this or any of the recipes given for 
pheasants. 

Faiaan a Vetouffade. — ^Truss an old bird neatly as 
for roasting, and lard the breast carefully (the 
poulterer will often do this for you), wrap it in a 
slice of fat bacon, and lay it in a stewpan just large 
enough to hold it comfortably, and previously lined 
with sliced carrot and slices of fat and lean ham, 
pour in suflBcient wine and good (game) stock to 
reach up to, but not to cover, the bird ; lay a buttered 
paper over it, fit the lid on closely, and let it stew 
very gently and steadily for two hours, then lift out 
the bird and keep it hot, strain off the gravy, remove 
all the fat, and boil up sharply to reduce it ; pour it 
over and around the bird, and serve. 

Faisdn a la Souhise. — Braise it precisely as you 
would a fowl, and serve with a rich Soubise sauce 
poured over and round it. If stuffed with a good 
oyster forcemeat, braised, and served with a rich 
brown oyster sauce, it is known as Faisan a la Vic- 
toriay whilst if stuffed with chestnut stuffing, 
roasted, and served with watercress, it is known 
as F. a la Connaught. 

Pheasant and mushrooms. — Truss a nice pheasant 
as for roasting, and lard the breast neatly with fat 
bacon lardons ; then stuff the bird with the follow- 
ing : cut up ten or twelve large mushrooms into 
four or eight pieces, and mix them with 2oz. of 
butter, and season highly with salt and freshly 
ground black pepper ; cover the bird with thickly 
buttered paper, and ro^st for thirty minutes, keeping 



GAME. 171 

it well basted. Now remove the paper, and let it 
cook, uncovered, for eight or ten minutes to brown 
nicely, then serve. Few people who have not tried 
it know how well mushrooms, whether as stuffiuL*", 
pur^, sauce, or garnish, improve most game birds, 
grouse and black game especially. 

Black cock, unless very young, should not be 
roasted, as it is very dry, but it is excellent in that 
case en casserole (see fowl en casserole)^ braised, 
boHed, or stewed, and served with Soubise, celery, 
mushroom, or any other sauce to taste. Almond 
sau^e is often served with game, or even poultry, and 
is made thus : Blanch a small cupful of almonds and 
boil till soft in milk and water, with salt, pepper, and 
a pinch of sugar, then drain and pound to a paste 
with a little of the milk iu which they were cooked. 
Now stir this with ^oz. white roux into about half a 
pint clear white poultry stock very gradually, stirring 
it over the fire till thoroughly blended and of a nice 
consistency. A tablespoonful of cream, either with 
or without an eprg yolk, as a liaison, is a great 
improvement. This sauce may bo made with any 
kind of nuts, and if preferred brown, Iwike tlie 
blanched nuts before pounding thoni, and use 
brown roux and brown game stock. As a matter 
of fact, most birds are good en casserole. Partridges, 
besides being roasted, are excellent en casserole, a la 
Souvaroff, in pies and puddings, braised, or a^ix choiix. 
For this last, truss two partridges as for boiling 
(like a fowl), barding each with bacon, and placing 
an onion inside each. Cut a savoy cabbage into 
quarters aijcl blanch these, then steeping them for ais. 



172 MEATS. 

hour in cold salt and water. Now line a good- 
sized stewpan with sliced bacon, carrots and onions 
(also sliced), with a good bouquet and a seasoning of 
salt and pepper. Lay in the partridges, placing the 
quartered savoy between the birds, with some sliced 
streaky bacon, or strips of salt pork, and halved 
sausages or slices of Bologna sausage. Pour in 
sufficient stock to cover the birds, cover with a 
buttered paper, set it all on the fire closely covered ; 
bring to the boil, then draw it to the side and let it 
all simmer very gently and steadily for one and a half 
hours, when the birds should be tender. Now lift 
out the birds, bacon and sausages, and keep them 
hot. Strain the broth into a basin and set it away 
to cool. Meanwhile stir the cabbage over a moderate 
fire till it is dry, remove any fat there may be on the 
stock, add to it more stock — enough to bring it to a 
pint — and thicken either with 2oz. of roux, or loz. 
each of butter and flour cooked together till lightly 
browned and smooth. Halve the birds, dish the 
cabbage quarters in the centre of a hot dish, put the 
bird neatly on them, garnish with the bacon and 
sausage, and serve very hot, with the gravy in a boat. 
Tliere is another dish rather like this, and often 
served instead, called 

Chartreuse of partridge, — For this, three-parts 
cook two birds, and prepare a small savoy cabbage 
by first stewing it as usual in second stock, then 
draining it well; cut the quartered cabbage into 
two-inch lengths, and glaze these in a buttered pan 
in a little just liquid glaze. Have also ready some 
Qook^d ^nd turned carrots £md turnips (if you do not 



GAME. in 

wish for the trouble of turning them, slice them 
about as thick as half-a-crown), line a plain Charlotte 
mould with buttered paper, and garnish it with rings 
of the carrot and turnip; now lay in alternately 
layers of the cabbage and of the birds cut up into 
pieces till the mould is full, finishing with cabbage. 
Steam for a little till firm, then turn out and serve 
with a good brown sauce made from the giblets and 
trimmings of the partridges, to which you have 
added a glassful of Marsala. If liked, the bacon 
and sausage can be added to this. 

Landrail (or corncrake). — ^This bird, which is 
seldom sold, is in season from the end of August 
till nearly the end of September, and is trussed 
like a snipe, a thin skewer being passed through 
the thighs aud body to keep the legs out straight. 
It is barded, and roasted for fifteen to twenty 
minutes, and served with fried crumbs and clear 
gravy, or with bread sauce and a garnish of water- 
cress. 

Quailf when served as a rot, are roasted. When 
picked and singed, they are drawn through an 
opening aC the back of the neck, the neckbone and 
crop being removed with the head, but the trail 
being left in, or not, as preferred. When trussed 
rub the breasts of the birds over with warm butter, 
then bard first with a slitted slice of fat bacon and 
next with a nice fresh vine leaf, fast-ening these by 
means of a pack thread and skewers. Boast from 
ten to twelve minutes, basting almost incessantly 
with butter, if possible. To serve, remove skewer 
and strings, do not remove the bacon and vineleaf, 



174 MEATS. 

dish each quail on a crouton of fried bread, gamisl 
with watercress salad, and send fried breadcrumbs 
and a nice clear gravy to table separately, if liked. 

In the Levant, &c., where quail are plentiful, they 
are used in as many different ways as partridges, 
fresh bay leaves being often preferred to vine leaves 
for the barding. 

In France, in the autumn, when the vinevards are 
ready for the vintage, the grivef or thrush, is often 
eaten like a quail, roasted as above. At that season 
they are especially fat, from feeding on the grapes. 
They are also made into pies, &c. 

Ortolans, or beccaficos, are treated exactly like 
quail, barded with either a vine or bayleaf, and 
roasted for eight to ten minutes ; they must be basi/ed 
incessantly whilst cooking with butter. 

LarJcs are treated just like quail or ortolans, the 
trail being left, or not, as liked ; wrap each little bird 
in a slice of slitted bacon and thread them, half a 
dozen at a time, on a thin skewer and roast for 
eight or ten minutes, basting well a'lthe time. Like 
all other small birds, larks should have small pieces 
of battered toast placed under them whilst roasting, 
to catch the drip of the gravy, Ac, when the birds 
are basted. To serve, slip them off the skewer, place 
each bird on a piece of toast, and dish with a pile of 
fried breadcrumbs in the centre, and a garnish of 
watercress. 

Wheatears, like ortolans, &c., should be cooked as 
soon as possible, exactly like larks, either bread sauce 
or melted butter flavoured with lemon juice being 
banded with them, also a garnish of watercress. 



GAME. 175 

Ruffs and reeves are usually caught in traps and 
fattened for the market. They should be cooked 
pretty fresh, trussed and treated like woodcock. The 
ruff is the cock and the reeve the hen bird. Their 
season is March to May. 

Ptarmigan are cooked like grouse, &c., and must 
be freely basted whilst roasting and served very hot, 
often with cranberry or rowanberry jelly. Their 
flavour, which is peculiar, is as much disliked by some 
as it is appreciated by others. These birds should be 
well hung. 

Prairie and hazel liens may be treated like fowls 
or pigeons, or like partridges. They are better 
for barding or larding, and the former is good 
if sent to the table with a bigarade sauce — 
brown sauce flavoured with orange juice and peel, 
using Seville orange for choice and red wine. Baste 
well and roast for an hour or so, according to size. 
These birds, like ptarmigan, are often sent over 
from Russia and America frozen, so should be hung 
for an hour or two in the kitchen before use to thaw 
them, and should be well washed inside and out 
(British game does not need this) with soda, or 
vinegar, and water. Many people aver also that 
this foreign game is better for skinning before 
roasting, a treatment which certainly improves 
foreign black game. Capercailzie should always be 
chosen young, as with age the pronounced flavour 
derived from the nature of its food will render it 
uneatable to most persons. It is better for being 
barded, the bacon being lifted off a few minutes 
before it is finished to allow of the breast browning 



176 MEATS. 

properly. Like black cock, this bird is excellent 
siewod or boiled (in which case it may be stuffed 
with chestnuts, and, if liked, a delicate sausage meat 
farce), a rich celery sauce should in this case always 
be sent to table with either. Plover are cooked like 
w()od(;ock, undrawn. They should be roasted with 
hot buttered toast, seasoned with lemon juice and 
coralline pepper, under them to catch the drip. The 
golden plover is best for roasting, the green is 
better for pie (like pigeon) or pudding. 

Woodcock and snipe are both cooked exactly as 
they are shot, and in consequence do not keep well. 
If buying snipe, look at the condition of the throat 
and boak ; if the former is muddy, and the latter 
very moist, they are too long kept. Pluck, but do 
not draw, the woodcock, put them to a sharp fire 
and roast for fifteen to twenty minutes, watching 
them and basting well all the time. A woodcock is 
by connoisseurs considered ruined if overcooked, 
and it takes very little to bring itto that condition. 
Put buttered toast under, as described for larks. 
Fried crumbs, bread sauce, brown gravy, and even 
bigarade sauce are advised by some cooks, others 
declaring in favour of lemon-flavoured melted 
butter, or white sauce. It is certain, however, that 
no accompaniment of these strongly -flavom-ed birds 
should be very highly tasting, or it will overpower 
the natural aroma of the bird. 

Pcacocl'y or rather peahen, for the hen bird is 
considered the best, is a somewhat unusual dish 
nowadays, but a distinctly good one. Truss the 
bird like a pheasant, tucking the head, left 



GAME. 177 

unplucked and wrapped in buttered paper, under 
the wing. Either bard or lard the breast, and roast 
for one to one and a half hours, according to size. 
To serve, unwrap the head, trim the feathers, glaze 
the larding with a red hot shovel, and serve with a 
little clear gravy and seasoned watercress. 

TVild duck roasted. — Truss like a duck, brush it 
over well with butter, and cook at a sharp heat for 
fifteen to eighteen minutes," basting it well all the 
time. The heat should be fiercer at first to keep the 
juices well in. A wild duck must on no account be 
overcooked. Serve with seasoned watercress, a 
halved lemon and cayenne pepper being handed 
round. Other people serve orange salad with wild 
duck, made thus : carefully remove the peel and 
pith from four or more oranges, and slice down the 
pulp in its natural divisions, take away any pips or 
bits of white skin, and sprinkle the fruit with finely 
minced tarragon and chervil, a dessertspoonful each 
of brandy and salad oil, and a pinch of sugar ; pile 
this all up on a dish, and leave on ice for two hours 
or so before serving. 

Teal, widgeon, and pintail are all cooked the same 
way, only allowing rather less time on account of 
size. The following sauce is frequently served with 
either, or indeed with wild duck also : to a gill of 
good brown sauce add the strained juice of an orange 
and a lemon, a good dust of coralline pepper, a small 
teaspoonful of Lemco, and two minced shallots : 
bring it all to the boil, skim it, add a wineglassfu] 
of either port or claret, and a little caster sugaj. 
tammy and use very hot.

Canvas-back duck, — This is peculiarly a delicacy 
belonging to the United States, can be tasted is 
perfection nowhere else, and is a somewhat costly 
dainty even there. A very good imitation, however, 
can be made by the curious in the matter of novelty 
if they stuff a plump British wild duck with celery 
before roasting, as this gives the flesh some measure 
of the celery flavour which is the speciality of the 
canvas-back, and is gained by the birds feeding on 
the wild celery found in the marshes of America. 

Boast swan. — Mince finely 31b. of rump steak with 
three shallots, and season liberally with pepper, salt, 
and grated nutmeg. Truss the bird like a goose, 
stufling it with the rump steak, &c., sewing it up tc 
prevent the stuffing escaping. The old-fashioned 
way was to wrap the bird in well greased or buttered 
paper, then in a flour and water paste (like venison), 
and lastly in another sheet of strong paper, and roast 
for about four hours, keeping it well basted all the 
time. Now it is only wrapped in one coating of 
pa])er, and very liberally basted, of course taking 
only about half the time to cook. When cooked, 
remove the coverings and froth it with a little flour 
and butter, and dish up with brown gravy round if, 
and port wine sauce. This is a Norwich recipe, 
which town was famous for swans. Swans are at 
their best from September to November. 

Wild goose. — The wild goose, or grey lag, is still 
seen occasionally, and is by no means to be despised. 
If quite young it may be roasted like an ordinary 
goose, or it may be cooked like the swan, in paste, 
but stuffed with the following : mince finely together 



GAME. 179 

lib. of beef suet freed from string, &c,, two shallots, 
a handful of parsley, a little thyme, sweet basil, and 
marjoram ; to this* add a pound of breadcrumbs, 
^Ib. of butter, two whole eggs, and a good seasoning 
of pepper, salt and grated nutmeg ; knead well 
toj^ether and use. A wild goose thus prepared takes 
about three hours, should be frothed up at the last 
with butter and flour, and be served with braised 
onions, and Poivrade sauce. 

Only a young wild goose should, properly speak- 
ing, be roasted, as older birds are apt to contract a 
fishy, rank taste. To obviate this, either skin the 
bird before cooking, or baste it for the first ten 
minutes of its roasting with sea or salt water, in 
which an onion has been boiled. This is a keeper*s 
recipe, and applies to any water fowl suspected of a 
fishy taste. An elderly wild goose is excellent 
braised, stewed, or en daube, and either old or young, 
if roast d, goes well with celery or mushroom sauce. 

One hint may here be given with regard to 
" mock " game. If, by any chance, you are short of 
game for a salmi, <&c , take a nice young fowl 
trussed for roasting, and roast it with the game 
bird you are about to use, placing it in such a 
manner that the basting from the game bird falls on 
the fowl and so flavours it. Then, when half or 
three-parts roasted, cut up the fowl into neat pieces 
and leave these to steep till wanted, in strong game 
stock ; it can then, when wanted, be lifted out and 
finished off with the other bird, and few persons will 
d*»tect the difference.

for seven or eight days, and skin it thus : remove 
the legs at the first joint, then slit the skin down 
right along the breast, raise the skin and force the 
hind legs out, leaving the tail on ; now draw the skin 
back, like a glove, over the back, head, and forelegs, 
leaving the ears on ; remove the eyes with the point 
of a knife, then open the animal and remove the 
intestines, only leaving the kidneys. Be very careful, 
when doing this, not to break the pouch ; should the 
latter, however, get broken, wipe the hare out well 
inside, at once, with a dry cloth. Now cut the 
sinews under the hind legs and press them towards 
the head, bringing the front ones back so that a 
skewer can be passed through both legs, on one side, 
then through the body and out through the two legs 
on the other, fastening the stewer with a string over 
the back to keep the carcase in good position. 
Finally press back the head, keeping it in place with 
a skewer run through the shoulder, then through the 
back of the neck, and out again through the other 
shoulder, fastening it as before, with a pack-thread. 
Brush all well over with warm dripping, bard the 
back with a good slice of fat bacon, and roast for 
twenty to thirty minutes before a sharp fire, accord- 
ing to the size of the hare and the degree of cooking 
you prefer. Keep it well hasted all the time of 
cooking. It is impossible to enforce this rule too 
stronp^ly, for, necessary as it is with every kind of 
roast meat, it is indispensable with hare, which is but 
a dry meat at best. When cooked, place the hare on 
a flat dish, and serve with clear gravy and a garnish 
of watercress. Some people prefer to lard the back 



GAME. 181 

and thighs of the hare instead of barding it, and 
there is also a difference of opinion regarding the 
keeping or discarding of the barde when the animal 
is sent to table. If omitted, the bacon should be 
removed a little before the cooking is accomplished, 
the back should be lightly dusted with flour, the 
skin being allowed to brown and blister. A hare is 
also frequently stuffed with a good veal stuffing, to 
which the kidneys and liver (previously minced and 
fried in fat bacon with a moderate minced onion, and 
pounded to a paste) are carefully added. Abroad it 
is also frequently marinaded with a cooked marinade 
prepared thus : put into a pan four full table- 
spoonsful of water, one full one of good vinegar, a 
sliced onion, two sprays of thyme, a very small 
bayleaf , some parsley stalks (for cooking always use 
the stalks, reserving the parsley leaves for garnish), 
a few peppercorns, a little salt, and about an ounce 
of butter. Bring this all to the boil, then draw it to 
the side and let it simmer for five minutes, and when 
quite cold pour it all over the hare and let the latter 
lie in this for twelve to twenty -four hours. Baste 
the hare with the marinade occasionally during this 
time. Whilst it is roasting, strain the marinade, 
using some of it to baste the hare, and put the rest 
into a saucepan with the liver previously fried in a 
little butter, then mashed or pounded to a paste 
with the blood that was in the chest of the hare 
(which should always be kept for this purpose), stir 
it all well together, then add the gravy left in the 
pan, let it just come to the boil, and send to table in 
a sauceboat. After pouring off the basting liquor^ 



18^ MtATS. 

riusc out the dripping pan with a little hot stock or 
even water, and pour this over the hare. This is the 
French method of roasting a hare, and is excellent. 
By the way, many cooks use sour cream to baste the 
hare with, and brush it over with a little before 
sending it to table. N.B. — If you buy your hare 
and wish to lard it, be sure to have the thick bluish 
skin to be found on the legs, &c., carefully removed 
or you will have difficxdty in larding it ; and, more- 
over, this skin is apt to catch, and then forms a sort 
of burnt crust utterly destructive to the appearance 
of the dish. A hare must be cooked slowly to keep 
it tender, for it is only properly dressed when the 
long back fillets can be lifted out clean and whole 
with a silver spoon. A rabbit is excellent roasted 
like a hare, and may be served with any sauce to 
taste, tomato sauce being specially to be commended. 
Rdhle de lievre a la creme. — In France when the 
hare is large and the family is small, a hare is 
usually divided, the rdhle (in England known as the 
" baron,") being used for roasting, the rest being 
turned into a civet, the French form of jugged hare. 
For the rabies cut the hare through close to the 
shoulder blades, leaving the kidneys in the loin, 
removing the thick skin of the back and also the 
ends of the hind legs. This piece is then marinaded 
precisely as described above for twelve hours, basting 
it with the marinade in the same way. When cooked, 
set the rdhle on a hot dish well covered; now pour 
off all the dripping in the pan, leaving only the 
clear gravy, turn this into a clean pan with two 
£^ood tobiespoonsf ul of strong stock or melted glaze, 



GAME. 183 

boil it up for five minutes, tlien stir in off the fire a 
gill of sour or thick cream, to which you have 
added a few drops of vinegar, and serve over and 
with the rdblc. 

Soubise, mushroom, poivrade, or Italienne sauce is 
very good with roast hare. 

Civet de lievre. — Take the pieces left over from the 
rdhle and cut them into neat joints. Put into a 
delicately clean pan 4oz. or 5oz. of good bacon 
(rather more fat than lean) cut into largish dice, 
and fry a delicate brown in about loz. of butter 
or clarified drii)ping ; then lift it out and in the 
same pan fry till of a golden brown two dozen 
butter or silver onions ; now lift out these also, and 
place in the pan an ounce more butter or dripping 
and the joints of hare cut up, and fry these. When 
about half done, dust them well with a dessert- 
spoonful of flour, and when this has browned pour 
in about a gill of hot stock or water, return the 
bacon and onions to the pan with some mushrooms, 
if at hand, and a good bouquet ; then pour over it 
a gill of claret, to which you have added enough 
stock or water to cover the hare, &c., and let it all 
boil up sharply for a few minutes ; now draw it to 
the side and let it simmer gently and steadily for 
one and a half hours. Next add to it the liver of 
the hare mixed, as for the rdhUy with the blood of 
the chest, and let it all stew together for ten 
mmutes more. Lift out the bouquet, place a slice 
of delicately fried bread, cut into four, on a hot 
dish, dress the hare, &c., on this, pour the gravy 
round and serve very hot. If your gravy is too 



184 MEATS. 

thin, lift out the hare anu keep it hot, boiling up 
the gravy hard for a few minutes to reduce it. If, 
on the contrary, it is too thick, add a little hot stock 
to it, but of course this must be seen to before 
dishing it. Naturally if a whole hare is used, the 
quantities must be trebled. 

Jugged hare. — Skin and prepare the hare as 
before, cut it into neat joints, dredge these lightly 
with flour, and fry a nice brown in boiling butter. 
Thicken one and a half pints of strong stock with 
about 2oz. of brown roux (or loz. each of butter 
and flour fried slowly together till quite smooth 
and of a pale coffee colour), put this into an 
earthenware jar (made for the purpose), add the 
pieces of hare, an onion stuck with four or five 
cloves, a good bouquet (thyme, parsley, bay leaf), 
half a lemon peel and a tiny blade of mace, a good 
squeeze of lemon juice, with a rather strong season- 
ing of pepper, salt, and cayenne ; cover the jar down 
very tightly, stand it up to the neck in the bain- 
marie or in a pan full of boiling water and let 
it cook steadily till the hare is tender, which it 
should be in about three and a half to four and 
% half hours, according to age. (An old hare is 
generally used for jugging.) Mind the water out- 
side the jar is kept steadily boiling all the time. 
When nearly done, add a gill of port wine and some 
forcemeat balls fried in a little butter before putting 
them into the jar. Dish neatly and serve with red 
currant jelly. 

A leveret is cooked according to the first recipe 
jiven for roast hare, and is often served with green 



GAME. 185 

gooseberry sauce made thus : Blanch a pint of 
green gooseberries in boiling water for a minute or 
two, then drain in a colander, rub them through it 
back into the pan, add 2oz. of fresh butter, let them 
cook till done, and serve. Bottled gooseberries may 
be used for this sauce, but will not require the prefa- 
tory blanching, and may nead a drop or two of 
spinach greening, or colouring to bring up the tint 
a very little ; but this must be cautiously done, as 
any over-colouring is fatal to the appearance of any 
dish. A few drops of lemon juice may also be 
useful. 

It has been said above that rabbit is excellent 
roasted, and it has the further advantagj of 
being less often seen than the traditional boiled 
rabbit smothered in onions, known, when it appears 
in society, as 

Lapereau a la Souhise. — Wash the rabbit well, 
taking care to remove any trace of blood, especially 
about the head and neck, and allow it to soak for 
half an hour or so in warm milk, as this improves 
it immensely. Now place it in a pan with five or 
six good-sized onions, a good spray of parsley, thyme, 
and marjoram, two cloves, five or six peppercorns 
(white), and salt. Cover it all with hot water, bring 
it sharply to the boil, skim thoroughly, and then 
allow it only to simmer (for twenty-five minutes if 
the rabbit is young, longer if old) till cooked. Now 
lift out the rabbit, keep it hot, and meanwhile strain 
the liquor in which it cooked and thicken it like 
melted butter with an ounce each of butter and 
flour previously cooked together till smooth, rub the 



186 MEATS. 

onions through a sieve, adding a little of the milk 
in which the rabbit was soaked, to assist the oj^era- 
tion. Now work together gradually the rabbit 
liquor, the onion pur^e, and as much of the soaking 
milk as may be necessary for the right amount of 
sauce to cover the rabbit entirely, let it boil up, and 
continue stirring it over the fire till it reaches the 
right consistency, then dish the rabbit, pour the 
sauce smoothly over it, and serve with tiny rolls of 
crisped bacon. Some people prefer to cook the 
rabbit altogether in milk, using the soaking milk for 
this, and adding a little cream or a pat of fresh 
butter to the sauce just at the last. 

To truss a rabbit for boiling, after it is skinned, 
washed, and, if liked, soaked, slip a threaded trus- 
sing needle through the end of the hind leg, which 
should be brought forward, and then through the 
end of the front leg, which should be bent back, and 
draw it through the body and out through the 
two legs on the other side, brought into the same 
position. Now bring the needle back the same 
way, and pass it through the rabbit's jaws, the head 
being twisted round backwards, and pressed against 
the creature's side, and tie the two ends of string 
firmly together. When cooked, the string can easily 
be pulled out. For roasting, the rabbit should be 
set up like a hare, the ears, which are cropped close 
to the head for boiling, being left on. Cooked thus, 
a rabbit is excellent with many sauces, specially 
tomato or mushroom, but do not forj^et the bacon. 



CHAPTEE XI. 

PUDDINGS AND PIES 

Puddings and pies are especially Britisli forms of 
cookery, the former particularly so, for suet crust is 
a kind of paste foreign cooks appear seldom to grasp. 
To begin with puddings ; the first thing to consider 
is the crust, for unless this is right, the whole dish 
must necessarily be a failure. The ordinary method, 
for a pudding of 21b. of beef steak, and either six 
sheep's kidneys, or half an ox kidney, is to mince 
very finely ^Ib. of good beef suet, removing all skin, 
string &c., then rubbing it into lib. of flour; now 
gather it up into a heap on the slab or board, and 
with your knuckles make a hollow in the centre into 
which you put half a teaspoonful of salt, and about 
a gill of water. Now work this all to a rather stiff 
paste, adding either a little more flour if too soft, or 
more water if too stiff. Roll it out from a third to 
half an inch thick, have ready a pudding basin well 
rubbed over with clarified dripping or butter, as you 
please, Hne it with the above paste, and put the r< 
aside for a cover. This makes a very good everyday 



188 MEATS. 

suet paste, but for smarter Occasions, when the meat 
pudding is to be a feature, as in the case of wood- 
cock, small birds, or other delicate puddings, a richer 
form mav be used. For this take lOoz. of fine 
kidney suet weighed after ib has been chopped, &c., 
lib. of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, the yolk of 
a raw egg, and a teaspoonful, or perhaps a very 
little more, of strained lemon juice. Mix in the 
usual way, adding as much water as will be needed 
to produce paste of the right consistency. Then 
roll out and use as before. These recipes may be 
honestly recommended, but some cooks add about 
half a teaspoonful of baking powder as well as 
the raw egg yolk for each pound of flour, whilst 
others use a teaspoonful of baking-powder for the 
pound of flour and no egg. But if properly made, 
the baking-powder is not required. Lastly, where 
weak digestions have to be catered for, breadcrumbs 
dried and sifted may be substituted for some of the 
flour, allowing 4oz. of crumbs to 12oz. of flour. 
This crust is said to be both lighter and more 
digestible than the ordinary suet crust. Atora suet 
crust again, is much to be recommended and has 
the further advantage of being equally good baked 
or boiled (which the other crusts are not, as the 
suet is often scarcely sufficiently cooked in a baked 
pie to make the crust digestible). For this paste, 
with a sharp knife shred down the block of Atora 
suet as finely as possible, till it either curls or 
powders as it falls from the knife ; now rub it into 
the flour with the tips of the fingers as if mixing 
short paste, and get it to the right consistency, either 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 189 

with water alone, or with egg yolk, lemon juice and 
water as before. 

Beefsteak Pudding. — For this take sufficient paste, 
say from one-half to two-thirds of the first plain 
paste, and with this line the buttered basin. Cut 
IJlb. of beef steak up into narrow strips, dipping 
each into a seasoning made by mixing together one 
and a half teaspoonsful of salt, about a teaspoon - 
ful of freshly ground black pepper, and a table- 
spoonful of browned (not burnt) flour ; then lay these 
strips into the basin, adding a small piece of fat with 
each one, and dusting each layer with finely minced 
parsley and very finely minced shallot or onion (a 
small onion is enough altogether) ; now pour in about 
three-quarters of a pint of either cold stock or water, 
a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and, if liked, 
a little Worcester sauce; cover with the paste, 
previously rolled out three-quarters of an inch thick, 
after wetting the edges, and press these well together, 
trim off any superfluous paste, tie a cloth over the 
top, set the basin in a pan containing boiling water 
enough to cover the pudding completely, and cook 
for two and a half hours, watching that the pudding 
is always under waier. It is quite worth the trouble 
to be careful about the temperature of this outer 
water, for a pudding cooked in water always kept 
jvst at boiling point, but never allowed to ** gallop," 
is infinitely better than one where the water has had 
to be constantly renewed from evaporation. The 
above is a simple but excellent form of boef steak 
pudding, but it may be varied almost indefinitely. 
For instance, any small birds, such as larks (or even 



190 MEATS. 

sparrows ! ) may be added in the proportion of four 
to six birds to the pound of steak ; or six or seven 
sheep's kidneys (or half a young ox kidney), well 
seasoned with pepper, salt, minced parsley and 
shallot, may be used for the same quantity of beef ; 
or oysters, mushrooms, shrimps, and indeed any 
other addition to taste, may be utilised to the 
improvement and variety of the dish. A very pretty 
dish for smart occasions may be made by well 
buttering some dariole moulds and then lining them 
with thin suet crust, filling them with pieces of fillet 
of beef and sheep's kidney, all cut into rather large 
dice, seasoning this well with pepper, salt, minced 
parsley, and two or three chives or a little finely 
minced shallot ; fill up with stock or nice brown 
sauce to taste, cover and cook as usual for about an 
hour or more, according to the size of the puddings ; 
then turn out and serve, one for each guest. These 
little puddings may be made of any meat, a lark 
boned and stuffed with the farce given later for pies 
and laid, breast down, on a little of the farce, and 
covered with a tiny slice of beef skirt, makes a par- 
ticularly toothsome dish. It is a secret almost 
unknown, and certainly disregarded, by cooks, that 
in a meat pudding, of which the steak is the only 
adjunct, beer ** skirt," if cut thin, is more satisfactory 
than anything save the best fillet steak, as it gives 
far more gravy and does not harden in the cooking. 

The above may serve as a type for puddings in 
general, of which we now give a few individual recipes. 

Mutton Pudding, — For this either trim very neatly 
and rather small, and removing all the superfluous 



PUDDINGS AKD PIES. 191 

fat, tlie cutlets of a neck of mutton, or if preferred, 
use an equivalent amount of the leg of mutton cut 
into neat scallops ; season well with quatre Spices, or 
mignonette, minced chives or shallot or very finely 
minced onion, parsley and thyme ; now put in a layer 
of mutton, then one of sliced potato, till the basin is 
nearly full ; moisten as before, with mutton broth if 
possible, to wliich you have added a few drops of 
essence of anchovy, cover down and boil for two and 
a half to three hours as in ]a'evious recipes; then 
turn out and serve with a little good gravy poured 
round. 

Small Bird Pudding. — Any kind of small birds 
may be used for this ; from larks or sparrows to 
plover or wheatears, or even, low be it said, thrushes. 
Pick and clean the birds, removing the gizzards, the 
heads, and feet (for a good sized pudding you 
require eighteen to twenty-four larks) ; line a basin 
with the egg yolk and lemon crust, and proceed to 
pack it with the birds and about |lb. of good bacon 
or ham cut into neat fingers, in alternate layers, 
dusting each with pepper, salt, minced parsley, 
thyme and shallot or chives ; then pour in a gill of 
strong stock, cover and boil for one and a half to 
two hours. 

Veal Kidney Pudding. — Roll out the requisite 
crust half an inch thick, and line a well buttered 
pudding basin. Now remove the core from a nice 
calf's kidney (use two if small), wash well in weak 
vinegar and water, cut it into inch dice and mix 
with it from 3oz. to 4oz. of fat bacon or pickled pork, 
seasoned pretty highly, rolling it in quatre epices, 



204 MEATS 

and even woodcock may be made into pies in the 
same way. 

Woodcock Fie. — Bone from four to six woodcock, 
and put the bones and trimmings. into a pan with 
two shallots and a good bunch of herbs, cover this 
ill with strong stock, bring it to the boil, and 
then let it simmer gently at the side of the fire 
till all the goodness is extracted from the bones, <fcc. 
Meanwhile prepare some forcemeat thus: Mince 
finely about |lb. of raw veal and pound it smooth, 
then work into it 5oz. of panade (this is simply 
melted butter made with an extra quantity of 
fine flour and cooked to a smooth and rather thick 
paste) previously also pounded, together with 3oz. 
or 4oz. oi ]pdte defoie gras, and a good seasoning of 
salt, white, and coralline pepper, mixing it well with 
two whole raw eggs or three q^^ yolks ; and, lastly, 
mix in the hearts and livers of the birds, minced and 
pounded. Lay the woodcock, breasts down, on 
a board, spread each with a layer of the farce, 
then on this put a layer of sliced trufifles, then a 
second layer of the farce. Line a mould with good 
raised pie crust, pressing it well into the mould, put 
at the bottom a layer of farce, then two of the 
woodcock, covering these with sliced truffles, next 
the other two birds, with more truffles, and lastly, a 
pretty thick layer of farce, covering this with sliced 
fat bacon, and two bay leaves. Cover the pie as 
usual, leaving a hole at the top, and bake in a 
moderate oven till done; then pour in the gravy, 
recover the top and do not touch it till cold, when 
you slip off the top crust, remove the bacon and the 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. 205 

bay leaves, and cover with finely chopped aspic, and 
the pastry cover. 

Babbit Pie. — Prepare a plain herb forcemeat, 
as given for turkey, only using half the quantity, 
and mixing it with the liver and kidneys of 
the rabbit, and about 4oz. of cold cooked veal or 
fowl, all previously minced and pounded fine ; sieve 
this all through a wire sieve, and place a layer of it 
at the bottom of a pie dish, and on this spread 
a layer of bacon, and then the rabbit cut into joints, 
dusting it all liberally with quatre Spices or GoufiPe's 
mignonette, and filling the spaces between with some 
of the farce and quartered hard-boiled eggs ; now 
have a second layer of bacon, then more rabbit, 
and lastly the rest of the forcemeat, covering 
this again with a few slices of bacon ; pour in about 
half a pint of strong stock made from the head, neck 
and trimmings of the rabbit, and a piece of gravy or 
stock beef, flavoured with the usual vegetables. 
Cover this pie with a good crust and bake one and a 
quarter hours in a good oven. For this, take one 
good rabbit and ^Ib. of beef. 

Hare Pie can be made in precisely the same 
way, only remember to add a glass of port wine, 
a teaspoonful of good vinegar, and a good spoonful 
of red currant jelly to the broth when strained, 
before adding it to the pie, and season highly 
with the mignonette. Ham also may be used entirely 
or half and half with the bacon, if liked, for 
hare pie. Moreover, both rabbits and hares may 
be boned, the bones being used for the stock, 
and the flesh packed into the pie dish in layers with 



206 MEATS. 

the ham or bacon and forcemeat, as you please. 
It is best to keep a little of the stock I ack, to add at 
the last, dissolving in it |oz. or so of best leaf 
gelatine if the pie is only to be eaten cold. Be very 
careful to make a good vent hole in any rabbit pie, 
and do not put the centre rosiB in, whilst cot^king, 
however loosely, as nothing is so unwholesome, 
not to say actually dangerous, as an imventilated 
rabbit pie. 

Shropshire Rahhit Pie, — An old-fashioned, but 
extremely good, pie is still made in the country 
thus : Cut up two rabbits and 21b. of fat pork, fresh 
or pickled, and season rather highly with pepper, 
salt, and spice to taste. (The mignonette is specially 
good for this.) Line a pie dish with good puff paste, 
and lay in the rabbits and the pork, mixed. Have 
ready some little forcemeat balls, and mix these with 
the rabbit, &c., together with artichoke bottoms cut 
in pieces, some bearded oysters, and cocks' combs (a 
tin of financiere garnish might be used) ; grate a small 
nutmeg over it all, pour in not quite half a pint of 
equal parts of stock (or water) and red wine, cover 
with puff paste, and bake one and a half hours in a 
quick, but not fierce, oven. Hard-boiled and 
quartered eggs are often added to this pie. When 
baked, pour in about a gill of the wine and stock, 
with or without a little leaf gelatine ; cover the hole 
with the pastry rose, and leave till cold. For the 
forcemeat parboil the livers, mince and pound them 
fine with an equal quantity of fat bacon, moisten it 
all with the oyster liquor and the yolk of an egg, 
seasoning it highly, and make into little balls. 



PUDDINGS AND PIES. ?C7 

Grouse Fie. — Pluck, draw, and bone two brace of 
grouse, and stuff the birds with the farce giyen 
below. Line a good-sized plain timbale, or cake 
mould with a good paste (such as the " rich short 
paste" given in the beginning of this chapter), and 
cover the bottom and sides of this with a layer of 
the farce ; lay in the birds, and fill up with a pound 
of tender rump steak, well seasoned, cut thin, and 
each piece rolled round a little bit of fat, to fill up 
the interstices, adding hard-boiled eggs, if liked. 
Cover with the crust, and bake three hours in a 
moderate oven. For the farce j par-fry lib. of calf's 
liver, cut into dice, in butter, then mix it with Ijlb. 
of veal cutlet, lib. of not too lean ham, a Httlo 
parsley and shallot, all previously minced, pound it 
smooth, rub it through a wire sieve and after 
seasoning it rather highly with quatre Spices or 
mignonette, stir into it a small bottle of truffles 
and three hard-boiled eggs sliced, and use. If 
truffles are not at hand, use a small tin of truffled 
pate de foie gras, which is often better than the 
bottled truffles, as these have only too frequently 
lost their flavour. This is a super-excellent pie 
and well worth the trouble of making. It is not 
difficult for an intelligent and willing cook to make a 
very nice timbale case for this, or any other rich, 
form of pie thus : Choose a round or oval stewpan 
which will go into the oven and line it well with 
the following paste — mix lib. of sifted flour with 
4oz. of fresh butter or lard, the yolks of two eggs, a 
little salt, and sufflcient water, to a stilE paste, 
kneading it well to get it firm ; roll it out the 



208 MEATS. 

size of the stewpan (whicli must liave been well 
buttered), put it into the pan, pressing it well in 
at the bottom and sides to make it take the shape 
nicely, and then pack in the filling ; cover plainly 
with the paste, and bake. When ready, turn out 
carefully, cut out a piece at the top, pour in some 
rich gravy, and fill up the hole with a nice pastry 
rose, baked separately. 

Venison Pasty. — Trim the meat from a well hung 
shoulder, neck, or breast as is convenient, into 
two inch pieces, season well with pepper and salt, 
and, if liked, a little nutmeg ; place the pieces, fat 
and lean together, into a rather deep pie dish (if there 
is not sufficient fat, take some thin slices from 
a well hung loin or neck of mutton and use with the 
venison), pour in a large glassful of port wine (or 
claret and currant jelly if preferred), with a good 
slice of butter laid over the top ; cover with a thick 
water paste (such as is used for roasting venison) 
and bake in a moderately hot oven for two hours. 
Wlien cold, remove the water paste (add some strong 
gravy mixed with wine), re-cover it with another cover 
of puff paste, ornament with leaves, &c., to taste, and 
bake in a good oven till the paste is nicely cooked. 
This is very good and possesses the further merit ot 
keeping for some time, if, after the first cooking, the 
pie be put away untouched in a cool dry place 
till wanted, when the water paste can be removed 
and the pie finished off as above; but for keeping 
it will need nearly twice as much butter. 

Squah Pie. — Line a pie dish with a good crust, 
then put in a layer of apples, dusting these very 



tUDDlNGS AifD PIES. 'JCO 

lightly with brown sugar, then a layer of mutton 
chops well seasoned with pepper and salt, then more 
sliced apple, next some thinly sliced onions, and 
repeat these layers till the dish is full, add one 
pint of water, cover with the crust, and bake. Some 
West country cooks use pork with, or instead of, the 
mutton, strew currants and minced parsley between 
the layers, and finish up at the last with a little 
boiling cream. 

Booh Fie. — Pluck, draw, and singe four or more 
fine young rooks, and remove the backbones (if left 
in these are bitter), and then steep the birds for one 
and a half to two hours in water or milk, or half 
and half, after which cut them into neat joints, 
seasoning these rather highly with mignonette^ and 
pack them in a buttered piedish in alternate layers 
with thinly sliced beef steak or ham, some bacon, sliced 
hard boiled eggs, and little forcemeat balls ; add an 
oimce or so of butter broken up, and about one and 
a half gills of good strong gravy ; coTer with a good 
rough puff paste, and bake two hours or more till 
the pie is cooked. If the birds are skinned and 
freed from their backbones, they may be cooked by 
any recipes for game or pigeon pie. N.B. — This 
treatment applied to foreign game often renders it 
thoroughly palatable when otherwise too bitter. Be 
careful not to break the gall in drawing, but if it be 
broken, soak the bird in strong salt and water. 

Goose Fie, — This old fashioned pie, once very 
popular in Lincolnshire and the Eastern counties at 
Christmas lime, was made by boning a goose, 
a turkey, a fowl, a pheasant, and a partridge or

pigeon ; the turkey was then laid inside the goose 
the fowl inside the turkej, the pheasant inside th< 
fowl, the partridge inside the pheasant, and th< 
whole fastened and laid in a pa^te-lined timbale, th< 
interstices being filled up with sliced ham anc 
tongue and a rich forcemeat, such as was given foi 
the grouse or the rabbit pie, made with the livers o: 
the birds, &c. Clarified butter was then pourec 
over it all, the paste cover fixed on, well brushec 
over with beaten egg, and the whole baked in a gooc 
oven for four hours. I have known this dish t( 
be wrapped in buttered paper, then in water paste 
and roasted like a haunch of venison. It is ai 
excellent, if somewhat expensive dish, but a verj 
dainty imitation may be made by putting t 
partridge inside a good fowl, and a quail or { 
lark inside the partridge, a lump of pate de foie grcu 
going inside the lark, then packing the whole ai 
above in a raised pie mould lined with good raisec 
pie ci-ust, filhng it up as described for the larger pie 
with the addition of some jodte de foie gras. 



CHAPTER XII. 

SUPPEE DISHES. 

Supper is a rather nondescript meal, extending from 
the magnificent ball supper, with its truflOied pdUa, 
boar's head, and dinde en galantine, <&c, to the 
humble repast sacred to Sunday evening, when 
it is " cook's night out," and the housemaid's 
culinary knowledge is on a par with the monkey's 
supposed powers of speech. The following recipes, 
taken from past QueenSj have been so often asked 
for that it may be well to gather them in this form. 
Spiced Beef, — Choose a nice piece of beef about 
101b. or 121b, in weight, from the round, rump, or 
thick flank as you please, and rub well into it |lb. of 
coarse brown sugar (the kind known as "foot" 
sugar is best for this purpose, but is not always 
procurable), and let it stand for two days. Mean- 
while poimd together finely a large teaspoonful of 
mace, the same of black pepper, a small dessert- 
8X>oonful of ground cloves, half a teaspoonful of 
cayenne, a small nutmeg grated, rather less than 
an ounce of saltpetre, and 2oz. of juniper berries. 

p 2 



212 MEATS. 

Mix this all witli a little more sugar, and then rub 
it well into the beef, (after the latter has stood 
two days in the sugar), and again leave it for 
three days. At the end of these add ^Ib. of fine salt 
to the pickle that will have formed, and nib it 
all again into the beef, turning and rubbing it 
with this pickle daily for twelve days. (Where 
possible it is well to get a man to do this rubbing, 
on account of the strength required.) It may 
now be hung up to dry like a tongue, or can be used 
at once, as convenient. To cook it, if it has been 
hung and dried (when it is best), wash but do 
not soak it, tie it neatly into shape with broad tape, 
and set it in a pan that will just hold it and its 
addenda comfortably. Pour to it one and a half 
pints of good beef stock, skimming this carefully 
as soon as it boils up, then add one small onion, two 
large carrots, and a good bunch of herbs, bring this 
all again just (and only just) to the boil, then draw 
it aside and allow it to simmer gently for four and a 
haK hours. Now lift the meat into a deep earthen- 
ware pan, pour its own liquor over it, and leave 
it till well cooled; then set it between two dishes 
weighting these carefully and rather heavily, and 
leave it till perfectly cold, when it must be wiped aU 
over with a moist warm cloth, and finally glazed 
with its own gravy, strained, reduced by rapid 
boiling, and stiffened with about ^oz. of best leaf 
gelatine to the half pint of gravy ; or with aspic 
jelly. The latter is the commonest, the former 
the nicest method. 
Freased Beef, — For this many cooks take the salt 



SUPPER DISHES. 213 

brisket procurable, ready salted, of the butcher ; 
or it may be prepared thus: Take 61b. of nice 
brisket of beef, without bone if possible, but remove 
any if sent with it. Rub it well over with vinegar 
and moist sugar, and let it stand in this for an hour 
or two, then lift it out and put it into a pan 
with water or ordinary bone stock enough to cover 
it, together with two or three slices of bacon, fat and 
lean together (a little of this placed under the beef 
is good), two small onions, each stuck with three 
or four cloves, a dozen peppercorns and allspice 
mixed, a good bouquet (be sure it contains two 
bayleaves), two carrots, and salt. Bring this again 
to the boil, then simmer in a tightly covered pan for 
four to four and a half hours till the meat is cooked. 
Now lift the pan from the fire and leave it till 
the meat is fairly cool, when it may be lifted out 
and pressed between two dishes till perfectly cold. 
(Mind when pressing beef, or indeed any meat, 
to get the pressure even. It is no use putting 
a heavy weight in the centre of the covering dish, 
and leaving the ends unweighted, or the pressure 
will be unequal. Three lighter weights of about 
equal heaviness are far better than one heavy one 
planted in the middle). Meanwhile strain the 
liquor (there will not be much) left in the pan, and 
boil it down rapidly till it is a thickish glaze, and 
paint the meat over with this. Again let it set 
thoroughly, then brush it all over lightly with 
just liquid aspic jelly, or preferably with gelatine dis- 
solved in some clear stock, or diluted Consomm^ 
Maggi, in the proportion of |oz. to loz. of ^^^^ne 



214 MEATS. 

to the pint of stock. Apply when just setting. The 
joint should be trimmed into a neat oblong shape 
before this last glazing. Or, if you can salt at 
home, try this way : Choose a nice piece of thick 
flank or brisket, not too fat, and rub it with the 
following pickle daily for eight days : Dissolve ^oz. 
of saltpetre in a very little water, and mix it 
with 21b. common salt and ^Ib. of moist sugar. 
N.B. — ^In towns the family butcher will often do this 
pickling for a good customer. It is boned and well 
drained when lifted out of the pickle, tied into a 
neat quadrangular shape, and finished off by the 
above recipe. It may be glazed as above or it may 
be finished ofP with the brsu^ht glaze to be got from 
the grocer. As some co^^ks find this difficult to 
manage properly, here is the proper method : Peel 
about an inch of skin from the little glaze sausage 
as it comes from the shop, anr^ place this inch in a jar 
with a tablespoonf ul of cold ivater ; place this jar in 
another pan with abou* i wo inches of boiling water 
in it, and steam the glaze till it is dissolved. Mind 
the water in the pan does not get into the jar. 
Soak an ordinary penny gum or paste brush in a 
little hot water to get it soft, then apply a thin 
coating of the melted glaze with this all over the 
surface of the meat, laying it on rather than brush- 
ing it, so as to avoid any streaks or marks of the 
brush ; when this coating is quite set, apply a 
second, and, if liked, when this also is firm, give it 
one more coat, but remember this glazing must not 
be too thick, and must be laid on evenly or the meat 
will look vulgar. It is beat to allow half an hour to 



SUPPER DISHES. 215 

the pouud of slow simmering for meat cooked thus 
counting from after the water or stock boils up after, 
the meat is put in. The success of pressed beef 
depends on this very slow simmering. Be careful to 
choose a lean piece. Or : Choose a nice and not too 
fat piece of the brisket, of 71b. or 81b. (the brisket, 
or the thick flank, is usually taken for this joint), 
and rub it well with coarse salt for three days, then 
pound and mix together loz. each of black pepper 
and cloves, ^oz. mace, 2oz. dark brown sugar, and 
loz. of juniper berries; rub this well in, turning 
it and rubbing it daily for three more days ; then add 
some salt, about ^Ib., to the pickle that will have 
formed, and leave it in this for eight or ten days, 
turning and rubbing it daily ; then take it out, drain 
well, and either hang it up to dry or use it at once. 
Tie the meat neatly into shape (it should be an 
oblong), and lay it in the pan with two or three 
sliced onions and carrots, a blade or two of celery, a 
good bunch of herbs, ten or twelve peppercorns and 
allspice, the thinly pared rind of a lemon, and a 
small onion stuck with two or three cloves ; cover 
with cold water or second stock, bring it gently 
to the boil, skimming carefully, and then draw it 
to the side of the stove and let it simmer slowly but 
steadily for four hours or so till done ; now remove 
any bones, and let it cool somewhat in its liquor (in 
an earthenware pan — never let any meat get cold in 
a metal pan!), then lift it out, wrap it in a clean 
cloth, and set it in a dish under another, weighted 
with sufficient weights to press it firmly, and leave it 
there for ten or twelve hours. When you remove 



216 MEATS. 

the cloth, trim it neatly, brush it over with liquid 
glaze or stiff aspic, and serve neatly garnished with 
chopped aspic and fresh parsley. If preferred, fresh 
meat may be used; but then you must increase 
the quantity of spice put with it when cookiDg, 
allowing, say, a blade of mace, twelve or fifteen 
black peppercorns and allspice, five or six cloves, 
some green onions, parsley, thyme, bayleaf, and 
lemon peel tied up together, and the vegetables 
given above, and finish off as before. Of course, 
if done by the first method, it has a fuller flavour. 
Round of beef is excellent pickled in that way. 

BcBuf en Chaufroix. — The following is a recipe of 
Mrs. A. B. Marshall's, given me a year or two since, 
which has always been such a success that I give it here. 
Remove the bone, and any unnecessary fat and skin, 
&c., from a large piece of sirloin of beef, and roll it 
up neatly, tieing it into a cylindrical shape with 
broad tape ; wrap it in a sheet of paper previously 
well rubbed over with clarified dripping or butter, 
and roast (or bake in a very moderate oven) for 
three hours, keeping it well and constantly basted 
all the time. When cooked, remove the paper, but 
leave on the tape, setting it aside till next day, when 
the string is removed, the ends of the meat trimmed 
smooth and even, and the surface of the joint 
carefully masked with brown chaufroix sauce ; the 
ends must be left plain. Dish when quite cold, and 
serve garnished with seasoned watercress, seasoned 
artichoke bottoms, chopped aspic, and scraped horse- 
radish. This dish can manifestly be as simple, or 
as ornate as you please, aspic cream set qnd cut into 



SUPPER DISHES. 217 

different shapes, prawns or crayfish, &c., being 
all pressed into tlie service, but plain, as suggested 
above, it is excellent. For the ckaufroix sauce, stir 
together over the fire three-quarters of a pint 
of aspic jelly, a gill of rich tomato sauce, half 
a wineglassf ul of sherry, ^oz. of glaze, a teaspoonf ul 
(or more to taste) of essence of anchovy, and a dust 
of coralline pepper, let this all boil up sharply 
till reduced a quarter part, skimming it well all the 
time, then tammy or sieve it, and use when cool. A 
drop or two of carmine may be added to this to 
bring up the colour if necessary, but be very careful 
about this, for if in the least overdone it will give a 
most revolting look to the meat. Any well flavoured 
brown sauce, such as espagnole, champagne, &c., may 
be used for this masking, if an ounce of best leaf 
gelatine to the pint of sauce be boiled down in it, the 
whole being used whilst almost setting. 

Braised Beef a la FratK^aise. — Put 81b. or 101b. of 
round or rump of beef into a pan just large enough 
to hold it comfortably, laying in with it 4oz. sliced 
ham or bacon, a calf's foot cut up small, one onion, 
and two carrots sliced, a btmch of herbs (thyme, 
pa'sley, bay leaf, lemon peel, &c.), half a head of 
celery, a clove of garlic peeled but not cut (cutting 
it makes the taste st.onger), a few cloves and whole 
peppers, with salt to taste ; then add a full gill 
of white wine (Grave or Chablis, or, failing this, half 
a gill of sherry diluted with half a giU of water and 
the juice of half a small lemon), or a liqueurglassful 
of brandy, and about a pint of cold stock or water. 
Cover with a buttered paper, close the pan down 



218 MEATS. 

tightly, and simmer it in the oven with heat top and 
bottom for four cr five hours. When cooked, take 
the pan from the fire, let the meat cool a little in it« 
own gravy, then lift it out, and press between 
two dishes till perfectly cold ; now trim it neatly, 
and glaze with some of its own gravy ; dish 
with the rest of the gravy (which should be 
a perfect jelly), chopped finely, and the stock 
vegetables cut into tiny dice, seasoned with oil and 
vinegar, pepper and salt, and dished in little 
preserved artichoke bottoms similarly seasoned. 

Veal is also good if gently braised, as above, only 
then use French white wine or the eau de vie, and 
colourless veal or shank bone stock, and rather 
increase the quantity there given of sliced ham. 

Galantine of Veal. — Bone completely either a 
shoulder or breast of veal, removing the skin and 
most of the fat. Pare the flesh off to get it level, 
and mince this with a little more veal and an equal 
quantity of fat bacon or ham, seasoning it gener- 
ously with salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg (if liked), 
spread this farce, which should be very finely minoed 
(or even pounded), over the veal, and on it lay strips 
of ham, cooked tongue, mushrooms, or truffles, and 
blanched almonds or pistachios ; .spread a very 
thin layer of the farce over this, roll up the veal 
lengthways, very tightly, tieing it into shape with 
broad tapes, and then rolling it in a clean cloth or a 
piece of butter muslin ; lay it in a pan that will hold 
it nicely, with a sliced carrot or two, one or more 
onions (one stuck with three or four cloves,) some 
pieces of bacon rind, a good bouquet (thyme, parsley 



SUPPER DISHES. 219 

bajleaf, green onion, lemon peel, <&c.), and enough 
light stock, or equal parts of stock and white wine, 
to cover it. Bring it to the boil, then draw it to the 
side, and keep it simmering slowly and steadily 
for three hours or more till tender. Now lift it out, 
and let it cool in the cloth for a little ; when nearly 
cold remove the cloth and put the galantine between 
two dishes u.uder weights till perfectly cold. Mean- 
while strain the liquor, and put it into a pan over a 
sharp fire with the well whipped whites of two 
or three eggs, and keep it stirred till it boils up, 
when you cover it down tightly and let it simmer 
steadily for half an hour ; then strain, and as it 
is setting (it will be a stiff jelly) use it to paint over 
the galantine. This may manifestly be varied to 
taste. Some cooks use sausage meat instead of the 
veal, whilst others again add the contents of a tin of 
pdte de foie gras truffe to the veal and ham farce, &c. 
But the principle is always the same. 

The preceding is the galantine reduced to its 
simplest form. A somewhat more ornate and fuller 
recipe is the following : • 

Galantine of Veal. — Take a piece of breast of veal, 
about twelve to fourteen inches long ; bone and trim 
it carefully, removing all gristle and supeifluous 
fat, as well as some of the meat (about lib.). Take 
the meat and half a pound of fat bacon; pound 
together in a mortar, season with powdered spice, 
sweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, then pass 
the mixture through a wire sieve. Cut |lb. of boiled 
tongue in pieces about an inch square ; cut half 
a dozen truffles, each into three or four pieces. Lay 



220 MEATS. 

the prepared breast of veal skin downwards on the 
table, sprinkle it with pepper, salt, and powdered 
spices ; lay the pounded meat, the truffles, and the 
tongue on it, then roll it up neatly as a rolypoly 
pudding, and tie it up tightly in a cloth. Put 
all the trimmings and bones of the breast into a 
saucepan large enough to hold the galantine, add a 
calf's foot cut in pieces, the trimmings of the bacon 
(they must be perfectly sweet), two or three onions, 
and two carrots cut in pieces, a clove of garlic, 
a bunch of sweet herbs (thyme, marjoram, parsley, 
and bayleaf), cloves, whole pepper, mace, and salt 
in proportions, according to taste. Pill up with 
such a quantity of cold water as will leave room for 
the galantine to be put in. Set the saucepan on the 
fire, and when the contents boil put in the galantine. 
Let it boil gently without interruption from two to 
two and a half hours. Then lift it out, put it on a 
plate, and when it has cooled a little take off the 
cloth, tie it up afresh, and lay it between two dishes, 
with a moderate weight upon it, to remain till 
cold. 

Care must be taken in this last operation that the 
"seam*' of the galantine be made to come under- 
most. When quite cold undo the cloth, glaze 
the galantine, and garnish it with savoury jelly made 
from the liquor in which it was boiled. 

A galantine of fowl is made in pretty much the 
same way as follows : 

Bone the fowl and lay it out flat on the table 
or mincing board, getting it as even as possible ; the 
meat removed from the legs can be used for this, and 



StrPPEIl DISHES. ^1 

if you are using an old fowl (which is generally 
taken for galantine, as the loDg cooking makes it 
tender), pass this meat once or twice through the 
mincer before using it for this purpose. Flatten 
the meat with a wetted roller, and after pulling 
in the loose flesh or skin, get it into as trim a shape 
as you can. Now spread all over it a layer of 
delicately prepared sausage meat (4oz. white bread- 
crumbs, a good teaspoonful of salt, and about half 
that of white pepper, to each pound of lean pork), 
b-^ing careful to keep this farce a little within 
the edge of the meat ; on this lay strips of rather 
fat bacon, ham, tongue, and sliced hard-boUed egg, 
and some sliced truffles or mushrooms if at hand, 
and cover this again with the sausage mixture ; now 
roll it up very tightly longways, being careful 
to keep the farce well inside. Next roll this aU up 
as tightly as you possibly can in a clean wet cloth, 
tie up the ends well, and fasten it roimd with broad 
tape to keep it in a nice bolster shape. Sinuner 
it very gently (allowing forty minutes to the poimd) 
till done, when you lift it out and leave it to press 
between two dishes under heavy weights. If on 
lifting it out of the pan the doth looks wrinkled, take 
it off, re-roll the galantine, and then put it to press 
as described above. When perfectly cold remove 
the cloth, wipe the galantine to take off any fat that 
may be adhering to it, brush it all over with just 
liquid aspic jelly, and serve garnished with chopped 
aspic round it. An old turkey is made into a 
galantine in precisely the same way. Mutton 
makes an excellent galantine, if treated in this 



222 MEATS. 

way, but the stuffing in this case reqtiires the 
addition of a layer of veal stuffing, to which you 
have added an anchovy or two, washed and minced, 
while brown sauce stifEened with gelatine should 
be used instead of aspic to glaze it. Olives, if at hand, 
are a delicious addition to mutton galantine. The 
breast of either veal or mutton boned makes excellent 
galantine. You can, of course, make your galantine 
more or less delicate by adding truffles, pistachios, 
&c., to the farce, and about half a gill of sherry or 
Marsala to the stock in which it is cooked. 

Again there is the — 

Chaufroix of Fowls. — Eoast two large fowls with 
a piece of buttered paper tied over their breasts, so 
that they shall not take colour. When cold carve 
them neatly, taking the fillets from the breast, and 
carving the wings and legs into neat joints ; remove 
the skin from each piece, break up the carcases, and 
put them, with the trimmings, into a saucepan with 
sufficient well-flavoured white stock to cover them, 
and with a couple of shallots, two or three cloves, a 
bunch of sweet herbs, pepper and salt to taste, and a 
wineglass of white wine. Let the whole boil gently 
for two hours. Strain the liquor, and free it 
absolutely from fat. Eeduce it on the fire, and add 
to it, if necessary, a little uncoloured aspic jelly in a 
liquid state ; then stir in, off the fire, the yolks of 
one or two eggs beaten up with the juice of half 
a lemon. Dip each piece of fowl in this sauce when 
it begins to get cold, so that each piece is thickly 
coated with it all over. When quite cold arrange 
the pieces on a dish, putting the legs underneath and 



SUPPER DISHES. 223 

the best pieces on the top. Ornameiit with slices of 
truffles and chopped up aspic jelly. 

Stewed Fowl in Aspic. — ^Truss a large fowl as for 
boiling (it need not be so very young), and stew it 
very gently for an hour or so with a few soup 
vegetables, a bunch of parsley, some young green 
onions, and a slice or two of lean smoked ham, with 
seasoniog to taste. When quite cooked, lift it out 
into an earthenware pan, pour the liquor in which it 
was cooked over it, and leave it thus till cold. 

Prepare some white chaufroix sauce thus: Boil 
together a gill of velout^ sauce (i.e., melted butter 
made with white stock instead of water), a gill of 
single cream or new milk, and a gill of aspic till it is 
reduced a fourth part, skimming it carefully. When 
this is cooling lift the fowl out of the liquor, wipe 
away any vegetable or fat that may be adhering to 
it, and then mask it all over with the chaufroix 
sauce just as the latter is setting, and put it aside 
till firm. 

Boar 8 Head. — Take the head of a bacon pig, cut 
it low in the shoulders, singe it, and then proceed to 
bone it, beginning at the throat ; the tusks must not 
be removed, but scraped. Take out the tongue and 
pickle it in the same way as the head. For the pickle 
take 31b. or 41b. of common salt, and jlb. of salt- 
petre, pound them well together, and rub them well 
into the head all over, especially over the eyes and 
ears, turn it over in the brine each day for a fort- 
night, then drain and dry it with a cloth. Have 
ready 31b, or 41b. of forcemeat (as for a galantine), a 
bottle of truffles, jlb. of pistachio nuts previously 



224 MEATS. 

blanched, and proceed to line the head in the same 
manner as a galantine, by putting a layer of force- 
meat an inch thick, then fill up with the tongue, cut 
in six pieces lengthwise, and with the truffles and 
pistachio nuts, add salt and pepper and a little grated 
nutmeg ; roll it up in a strong cloth, which should 
be greased, and tie it at both ends to preserve the 
shape of the head, place it in a braising pan with 
sufficient stock to cover it, and with any trimmings 
of game, poultry, or beef bones at hand, put in two 
carrots, three onions, parsley, thyme, a blade or two 
of mace, and half a dozen cloves. Leave it to simmer 
gently for five hours, take out the head, and arrange 
the cloth tightly round it to preserve the shape, as 
it will have shrunk considerably in boiling ; put it 
into a deep pan, pour the stock on to it, and leave 
until quite cold ; then remove the cloth, place it 
in the oven for a few minutes to melt off the jelly, 
or wipe it with a cloth dipped in hot water and 
wrung out; glaze it over with a dark glaze, and 
ornament with aspic jelly, white of egg, and beet- 
root. Italian paste or macaroni is also often used 
for the ornamentation ; it should be boiled first for 
ten minutes, and thoroughly divided by pouring 
cold water over it. Each piece should then be laid 
on with a trussing needle, and may be very tastefully 
arranged in a variety of devices. Lard can also be 
used plain, or coloured red or green, with cochineal 
or spinach greening, and it should be piped on in 
the same way as sugar icing is done in ornamenting 
cakes. All this, however, needs taste and judgment, 
for if the least overdone it is hopelessly vulgarised. 



SUPPER DISHES. 225 

Lastly there are the terrines and the moulds, both 
extremely nice for cold meats of any kind. Pies 
of various sorts have already been described, but the 
terrine, a form of pie after all, may here be given. 

Terrine of Hare. — Cut the flesh from a nic-e hare, 
and slice it into neat fillets ; have ready some stuffing 
(such as is used for hare) and some fresh sausage 
meat, with some sliced bacon. Put a layer of 
stuffing at the bottom of the terrine, and lay on this 
thin slices of the bacon, then a layer of hare, and 
lastly a layer of sausage meat, and repeat these till 
the terrine is full, seasoning each layer with pepper, 
spice, &c., and sprinkling them with sherry or port 
wine, and some good stock made from the carcase of 
the hare ; when full lay a slice of raw fat bacon on 
the top, cover it with a buttereJ paper, and stand 
the terrine in another pan with boiling water, more 
than three parts the depth of the terrine, and bake it 
in a moderate oven for one to one and a half hours, 
according to the size of the terrine. When cooked, 
remove the fat bacon, and let it get perfectly cold, 
when a layer of butter (melted) should be run over 
the top. 

This will serve as a guide for all sorts of terrines. 
Fish is particularly good this way, if a nice fish 
farce is made of common fish and prawns, fillets of 
lobster or salmon, oysters, <fec., are used as the filling. 

Terrine of Ham. — This is a German recipe, and 
perhaps for English tastes the quantity of lard 
might be lessened. Cut up lib. each of veal and 
fresh pork freed from all skin, sinew, <S:c. ; make 2oz. 
or 3oz. of butter or lard hot in the frying-pan, then 



226 MEATS. 

slice into it an onion, add the meat and a tinv 
bouquet of herbs, and fry all these tiU cooked. 
When cool, pound them all in a mortar with about 
|lb. of lard or bacon fat, and rub this paste all 
through a sieve. Line a pie dish with some of this 
farce, and lay on it some ham cut into neat and 
rather thick slices ; repeat these two layers till the 
dish is full, keeping the farce last. Cover this all 
with slices of bacon, and over this place the paste, 
making a hole in the centre of the latter, and filling 
it with a small funnel of paste. Bake, and when 
taken from the oven pour in through the funnel 
a glass of sherry, and when the pie is cold a little 
liquid lard. Before serving it (it must be perfectly 
cold), cut round the top, lift off the crust, and 
remove the bacon ftnd the fat, cover with a little 
aspic, replace the cover, and leave it for half an hour 
or so till the aspic is firm. 

Terrine of Oame. — Take pheasants or partridges, 
woodcocks or snipe, or a mixture of some of them ; 
bone and cut them up in convenient pieces, larding 
the breast pieces. Take the livers, parboil them, 
and chop them up finely with an equal quantity of 
cooked veal (lean) and of bacon, then pound the 
whole in a mortar, adding during the process a 
small quantity of breadcrumbs soaked in stock, a 
little parboiled onion or shallot, pepper, salt, and 
powdered spices to taste, as well as some powdered 
sweet herbs ; also add a little fresh butter. When 
the mixture is thoroughly pounded, pass it through

or two eggs to bind it. Make a paste with two parts

of flour to one of butter, salt to taste, and as much 
water as is necessary to obtain a stiffish paste ; work 
it quite smooth, roll it out to a thickness of three- 
eighths of an inch, line a raised pie mould (pre- 
viously buttered) with it, taking care to make 
it fit exactly; crimp the edges at the top with a 
paste cutter, then line the pie with slices of bacon 
cut as thin as possible, and proceed to fill in with the 
pieces of game, truffles (previously cooked in white 
wine), and mushrooms (cooked in lemon juice and 
water), filling up the interstices with forcemeat. B j 
careful to pack the whole closely. Put on a cover of 
paste, make a hole in the centre, put a piece of 
buttered paper on the top, and bake about four 
hours in a rather slow oven. When taken out, pour 
in through the hole some hot aspic jelly. The next 
day take off the cover and lay on the top a layer 
of bright aspic chopped up, not too finely. 

Terrine a la Nerac, — Skin and cleanse one or two 
good rabbits, and remove all the flesh from the 
bones ; weigh this, and take twice its weight of raw 
ham (fat and lean) or fresh pork, and pass this all 
through a mincer once or twice ; then for each pound 
of meat add 4oz. of game or poultry livers and rub 
the whole through a coarse sieve ; turn this all into a 
basin, and work into it a sufficient seasoning of salt, 
coarsely-grotuid black pepper, very finely minced or 
powdered bay leaf, and a spray or so of thyme ; line 
your pat^ with this farce, pressing it well into shape 
with your hand, which should be constantly dipped 
into cold water, so as to get the mixture quite 
smooth; on this put a layer of any nice fillets of 

«42

poultry or game (previously seasoned with salt, 
pepper, and finely minced herbs), sprinkling these 
with a little sherry, then a layer of sHced foie gras en 
terHne, then a layer of very thinly shced fat bacon, 
and continue these layers till the dish is full, raising 
it well in the centre in dome shape ; and lastly, cover 
the top with a slice of fat bacon and two or three 
whole bay leaves, all well sprinkled with sherry; 
cover with paste, and finish as above. Before serving 
it the top crust should be cut off neatly with a sharp 
knife, the bacon and bay leaves removed, and a layer 
of chopped aspic put over it, and the cover replaced. 
This makes a most delicious pie for the Christmas 
sideboard, and is far less troublesome to make than 
it sounds. 

Terrine of Game (without game), — ^At the bottom 
of a round tin or mould place a few strips of fat 
bacon, then a layer of forcemeat, made as indicated 
below, then boned joints of rabbit or poultry, 
or small fillets of veal, filling up all spaces with the 
forcemeat, and placing more bacon at the top. Pour 
half a teacupful of gravy over aU, put on the upper 
crust, fastening the edges well and trimming accor- 
ding to fancy. When half baked draw the pie out 
of the oven and brush it all over with beaten egg. 
Bake altogether about an hour and a half. Force- 
meat : ^Ib. of calf's liver fried and simmered until 
perfectly tender, then pounded with an equal quan- 
tity of fat bacon, about a teacupful of breadcrumbs, 
atablespoonful of mixed and sifted herbs (sage, thyme, 
parsley, &c.), black pepper and allspice, of each half a 
t^aspoonful, and the same of salt. Mix thoroughly.

Terrine Souvaroff, — Pick, draw and smge the 
birds to be used, halving them if small or cutting 
them into joints if large. Pack them in a terrine, 
seasoning them as you do so with a little salt 
and freshly ground black pepper, and placing a layer 
of sliced truffles on each layer of bird ; if truffles are 
not at hand mushrooms may be used. When the 
terrine is filled with these layers pour in sufficient 
sherry to cover the contents entirely ; cover down the 
terrine, luting on the cover with a band of paper 
and egg and flour paste. Set the terrine in a pan 
of boiling water, and bake for thirty to sixty 
minutes, according to size. All game birds are 
excellent in this way, but poultry, pigeons, larks, 
quail, &c., are also very good. If to be served hot 
remove the paper band, pin a napkin roiuid the 
terrine, and send to table on a napkin or dish paper. 
If to be used cold, do not take off the paper band 
till the terrine is wanted for use. For the luting 
paste mix a little flour with half the white of an 
e<^g to a stiff paste. 

Of moulds there are many different kinds, but all 
are convenient, and very decorative. The following 
gives a clear idea of how raw meat can bo utilised 
for a mould. 

Jellied Veal, — Break a small knuckle of veal 
into pieces, and lay these in a stewpan with r^ quart 
of water, a spoonful or two of chopped onion, a blade 
of mace, three or four cloves, a bouquet of herbs, 
some peppercorns (these might be tied up in a 
small muslin bag), a sliced carrot, and some salt. Skim 
the water carefully as it comes to the boil, then let it aJl 



230 MEATS. 

simmer gently for three or four hours ; now remoye 
the veal, cut the meat up into neat pieces, and laj 
it in another pan, straining the liquor from, the first 
cooking over it, and allow it to simmer again for 
half an hour or so. Slice three or four hard boiled 
eggs, and arrange some of the slices at the bottom of 
a plain mould, then put in a layer of the veal (when 
cooled), then more egg, then a layer of small pieces 
of tongue or ham, and repeat these layers till the 
mould is full, when it should be put in a cool place 
to set. Turn it out by dipping the mould in some 
warm water, and running the blade of a knife round 
between the jelly and the mould, and serve garnished 
with watercress. 

Chicken or game make a somewhat similar dish 
prepared in this way : Cover the bird with boiling 
water, let the latter reboil, then skim well, draw the 
pan to the side of the stove, and let its contents 
simmer very gently till the fowl is tender, when it 
must be lifted from the liquor and both left till 
nearly cold. Now remove all fat from the liquor, put 
the latter in a saucepan with a clove, a sliced onion, a 
bouquet, and a small sliced carrot, and ^oz. of gela- 
tine, and simmer it all for ten or fifteen minutes ; now 
season to taste with salt and pepper, stra'n, and when 
cool pour some into a mould, leaving this till nearlv 
set. Now shred the flesh of the fowl free from skin 
and bone, and pack it into the mould with strips of 
ham or tongue, hard boiled egg, and French 
gherkins, with alternate layers of the jelly, finishing 
with the latter, and leaving it in a cool place to set. 
Then turn out and serve, garnished with salad. 



SUPPER DISHES. 231 

Veal Cake — Slice down four hard boiled eggs, and 
garnish witli some of the slices a well-bnttered basin 
or mould, then pack it with alternate layers of veal, 
ham, and hard boiled egg, seasoning these well with 
minced parsley, pepper, and salt ; when full, pour in 
a little good, well- seasoned stock, and allow it all to 
bake steadily for four hours. Let it stand till 
perfectly cold, then turn it out and serve garnished 
with chopped aspic and parsley. 

Fowls, pheasants, &c., can all be used thus, but in 
their case a little best leaf gelatine must be added to 
the gravy when strained off, and boiled down with 
it, to ensui'e the gelatine being thoroughly dissolved 
and blended with the stock. 

Moreover, any cold cooked meat or game can be 
used up in this way : Dissolve 1 |oz. to 2oz. of best 
leaf gelatine in a quart of good clear stock (the stock 
must be flavoured to suit the meat used) ; cut any 
remains of cold cooked game into neat little 
fillets, also some cooked tongue and ham, then pack 
a mould or basin with the game, ham, tongue, some 
stoned olives, sliced truffles, sliced hard boiled or 
plover's eggs, cubes of pate defoie gras, &c., according 
to what you have, and now pour in enough of the 
stiffened stock to cover the contents of the mould, 
and put it aside till set. Any scraps, however small, 
can be used up thus, and if set in tiny timbale 
moulds make an extremely pretty decoration for a 
mayonnaise.

PEEFAOE. 

^ Little, if any, originality is claimed for the 
v^following recipes, most of which have appeared in 
^the Cookery columns of the Queen during the 
^last eight or nine years, from whence they have 
been collected at the request of many readers of 
'the Queen, to save reference to back numbers not 
^ always within reach. Additional recipes have, how- 
^ever, been given, to bring this little work as much 
$up to date as possible; but all these, like the 
^previous ones, have been carefully tested, and are 
all (as I know from practical experience) well within 
the capacity of any ordinary "good plain cook," 
gifted with fair intelligence and a little goodwill. 
I desire also to take this opportunity of acknow- 
ledging my indebtedness to the various authors of 
standard foreign cookery books, and also to offer 
my grateful thanks to Mrs. A. B. Marshall, and 
several other well-known chefs, whose kindness 
has so materially helped and rendered possible my 
work in these last years.

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 



CHAPTEE I. 

THE STELL-EOOM. 

In former days there were few houses of any pve- 
tension to gentility and housewifery (and in those 
times the two words were usually far more close^ 
coupled than they are at present), that did not 
boast a still-room of some sort, in which the ladies 
of the household, matrons and maids, concocted the 
conserves, marchpanes, waters, essences, &c., whidk 
then had to be home-made if required at alL The 
room took its name from the still used in distilling 
the many odds and ends needed by the lady of the 
house, who not only provided the culinary wants of 
her household, bat was also responsible for as many 
of the ailments of her tenants as did not actually in- 
Tolve the attendance of the surgeon; and, unless 
she is greatly belied, very weird and (to use her own 
word) somewhat **ugsome" were the drugs she 
compounded. Now-a-days the name still remains, 



2 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

but the room is shorn of much of its previous im- 
portance, and is simplj the scene of the still-room 
maid's labours, in preparing the coffee, setting out 
the dessert, and, in short, is little more than an 
adjunct to the housekeeper's room. 

But the old still-room was the scene in former 
years of the arduous work, engaged in bj the mistress, 
or, in her default, by the housekeeper, in preparing 
the pickles, jams, comp6tes, sweets, biscuits, &c, re- 
quired for the family, and so it may well serve as 
the heading for this introductory chapter. It were 
well, in the country especially, if every lady could 
set aside a room which might be given up to this 
work, as then it could be carried on without dis- 
turbing the cook's equanimity. That good lady, not 
unnaturally, rather discountenances the invasion of 
her premises by the ladies of the family, whose 
culinary views she knows from sad experience to be 
'* death on theory, but mighty little on practice," as 
an injured cook was once heard to mutter, as she 
bowed out of her kitchen some young ladies who had 
kindlv undertaken to show her the latest ideas on " the 
theory of cooking." The usual result of such visits 
only too generally is a fearful litter, and a « isplay of 
dirty pots and pans (very likely some burnt or other- 
wise irretrievably injured), which will ensure the 
kitchenmaid from the danger of idle hands for some 
hours to come. Incidentally it may be observed 
that the lady-cook would effect far more good would 
she remember the old kitchen rule and ** clear up as 
she goes." The right way of cleaning pots involves 
«o little time or labour, that even were her cookery 



THE STILL-ROOM. 3 

unsuccessful, her cleanliness and dainty order would 
go far to reconcile even the most conseryative cook 
to her '* new-fangled notions." 

Whether, however, you set up a still-room, or elect 
to confide your preserves, &c., to " cook," one point 
must be carefully attended to, and that is the 
presence of the requisite utensils. These should be 
kept strictly for the one special purpose of preserve- 
making, and the small extra expense this will entail 
will be amply repaid by the pleasure derived from 
the home-made conserves. 

When the kitchen fire is not to be had, a gas 
ring, where obtainable, is certainly the nicest fire to 
use, allowing as it does of any degree of heat with 
the minimxun of trouble, avoiding the heat and 
scorch of the range when used for this purpose, and 
finally giving the least trouble in the matter of 
cleaning up. Next to the gas ring comes the oil 
stove, and for this Messrs. Bippingille supply most 
fascinating little stoves, but personally Holler's 
"Primus" stove (which consumes only the gas 
generated from the petroleum, and not the petrolexun 
itself) appears to me the most satisfactory, as it 
produces a moderate heat, or a fierce blaze, just as 
easily as the gas nng ; moreover, a very useful 
little hotplate to be used with it can be obtained 
from the Household Supply Stores, 119, New Bond 
Street, that will give all the advantage without any 
of the drawbacks of a kitchen range. Having 
obtained your stove, the next consideration is a pre- 
serving pan. The nicest and most durable (but 
also the most expensive) is made of bell metal ; next 

B

to this is the enamel lined pan, which is also 
extremely useful in pickling, as acids do not affect it ; 
and, lastly, there is the preserving pan of aluminium, 
of which, though I have heard much, I cannot speak 
from personal experience. But, whicherer you 
elect, it must be kept immaculate, and neyer on anj 
consideration used for anything but still-room use. 
Have also a couple of good hair sieves, which must 
be carefully scalded and dried after use ; a jelly bag, 
or a thick piece of felt-flannel, such as jelly bags 
are made of, which can be tied to the four legs of a 
reversed chair, set on another chair or a table (as 
shown in Vol. I. for soup straining), and allowed to 
droop a little in the centre, a basin being placed on 
the reversed seat of the chair to receive the strained 
liquid ; two or three squares of coarse muslin ; four 
or six wooden spoons of varying size (the very long- 
handled ones being especially convenient), which 
must be kept in spotless condition, and thus kept, 
are preferable to anything but silver, which house- 
wives of old always used if obtainable (remember 
nothing made of tin, iron, or pewter, should touch 
jams or preserves, if their colour is a matter of 
importance.) A good long handled skimmer should 
also be at hand for sugar boiling. Besides these, be 
sure there is an ample supply of jam pots of varying 
sizes, with white paper and vegetable parchment, to 
cover them, or, far better still, have a good supply of 
Messrs. Daniel Rylands' (Barnsley) preserving 
bottles of varying sizes. These are of three kinds, 
the Climax, the Lightning, and the May Queen. 
All three are alike in the matter of the fruit, <fcc„ 



THE STILL-ROOIL 5 

touching nothing but glass anywhere, the onlj 
difference lying in the method of sealing, which is 
extremely simple in every case. In the Climax the 
wide month is fitted with an india-mbber band out- 
side it, on which a strong glass top fits, being made 
absolutely air tight at the last by a fire-gilt metal 
cap, which screws down over all, firmly pressing 
down the glass top into its place, over the elastic 
ring. These bottles can also be had with a 
small vent-hole in the glass top for use in pre- 
serving when the fruit has to be cooked after 
bottling; it can then be closed with a tiny bit 
of cork, and a drop of wax dropped over this 
before the outer cap is screwed on. The May 
Queen bottle differs from this by replacing the 
screw cap by a wire bail, the ends of which fit into 
sockets on the bottle neck, and are locked into place 
by means of a lever. The Lightning bottle cap 
varies a little from both of these. It has a wire 
bail and leva:, but after the glass cap has been fixed 
in position over the rubber band, the end of the bail 
is passed over the top, fitted in between two glass 
studs on the cap, and the lever is pressed down till 
it locks the bail, and so keeps the lid in an air-tight 
condition. To open the jar, the lever must be 
raised, and the bail pulled towards the lever, off the 
cap. This last kind is, I believe, the most generally 
popular. The prices of all three are most moderate, 
and if any difficulty is found in procuring these 
most excellent preserving bottles, a stamped envelope 
with the enquirer's address will obtain from Messrs. 
Bylands' the name of the nearest agent. These save 



6 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

an immensity of trouble in the covering, and bein^ 
glass afford every opportunity of observing the 
condition of the preserves. 

These jars are equally available for pickles, pie* 
served fruit or vegetables, jam, &g. 

For pickling have a good supply of stoneware jars 
(carefully avoid all glazed ones, which are affected 
by the vinegar used in pickling) ; also small kegs, 
for preserving French beans, &c., which must be 
scrupulously dean, and should be well scalded out, 
thoroughly rinsed, dried, and then aired for a day or 
two before use. If you go in for home-made wines 
you will need two or more tubs, one of which used 
for fermenting, should be finished with a tap at the 
bottom to let off the clear liquid, and a rim round 
the top, on the inside, to keep back the skins, stalks, 
<&c. of the material used. 

Be especially careful of your sugar, which for 
preserving, miut be pure cane, if decent results are 
to be obtained. Inferior sugar is no economy, for 
though the first cost be less, the frequent failure it 
causes, more than makes up for the trifling extra 
outlay involved by the purchase of the better class 
of sugar. As a matter of fact no better object 
lesson on the (de) merits of the craze for cheapness 
at all cost, can be found than the result of so-called 
economical (we beg pardon, cheap) preserve-making ! 
If much preserving be done, it will be found most 
economical to buy the sugar in large quantities, as 
in this way naturally the prime cost is much reduced, 
the only question being its storage, and here comes 
*Ji the difficulty of that "cool, dry place'' always 



THE STILL-ROOM. ^ 

recommended for the storage of preserves of any 
kind. This is by no means easy to obtain; the 
cellar being only suitable for such preserved vege- 
tables as are stored in kegs or tubs, whilst the 
fluctuations of the kitchen temperature render a 
kitchen cupboard, or the ordinary store cupboard, 
fixed in most cases as near the kitchen range as the. 
builder can anyvray contrive to get it, far from a 
wholesome abode for delicate jams, comp6tes, or, in- 
deed, stores of any kind. This is one thing that 
renders preserving of any sort «omewhat of a 
trial to the town housewife; but in the country 
the expense of fitting up some small, unused, but 
dry room, in which a current of air is attainable, 
with shelves, <&c., will not be great, and will save its 
cost in a very short time. In this there should be a 
small cupboard in which the utensils used in pre- 
serving, <&c., can be religiously kept apart. 

Again, for pickling the best vinegar should always 
be used. Of this there are two kinds, the best malt 
for ordinary pickles, piccallili, &g., and the best 
white wine vinegar for delicate preparations, such as 
fruits in vinegar, <fcc. There are several inexpensive 
little labour-savers that should find a place in the 
still-room, such as an apple corer, a fruit stoner and 
seeder, paring knives, for peeling fruit, &c. These 
cost but little, though they save a good deal of 
labour and time. 

AU spices, <&c., likely to be required in pickling 
and preserving should be at hand in tins, neatly 
labelled, so that their contents can be identified with- 
out opening the tin, for the more air-tight such 



ft PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

tihings ore kept the better do they preserve their 
iavour. As not everv gum or glue will stick paper 
on to tin, the following formula may be found useful : 
dissolve loz. of powdered alum in a pint of boiling 
water, then add to it 2oz. of gum shellac, and boil to- 
^her till this also is dissolved; bottle and keep 
tightlj corked.. For liqueurs you will find it con- 
Tenient to have a jar (say a two-gallon one) full of 
stock syrup, which can be used plain or diluted as 
necessary, and so saves time when it may be of im- 
portance. For essences, and, indeed, many liqueurs, 
thoroughly good, over-proof, plain spirit may be ob- 
tained from the wine merchant, infinitely better than 
the ordinary so-called ** kitchen " or " cooking " 
spirits, though, if anything, cheaper than these. 
The great advantage of this plain spirit is that it 
does not detract from the flavour of the material to 
be preserved, as would very likely be the case with 
the more or less doctored cheap spirit. Of course, 
where first-class liqueurs for table use are in 
question, real good brandy, gin, <&c., should be 
employed as required, for, naturally, the better the 
jquality of this foundation spirit, the more mellow and 
perfect will be the liqueur. This is a fact, by the 
way, only too often ignored by amateur liqueur 
makers, who consequently bring home-made liqueurs, 
Jbc., into contempt. 



CHAPTER II. 

CANNING AND BOTTLING. 

The success of this process depends on heating the 
material to be canned till all germs are destroyed, 
then sealing it up till air-tight whilst it is boiling 
hot. You may can in two ways. 1. boil the fruit in 
the preserving pan either in syrup or water, till 
thoroughly cooked, then pour it scalding hot into 
the bottles, and pass the handle of a spoon down the 
sides of the bottle to set free any air-bubbles that 
may have been left in it ; then wipe the neck of the 
bottle with a warm moist cloth, put the rubber ring 
on in its place, and fasten it down tightly according 
to the style of bottle you use, tightening it down 
again when cold. It should be held upside down 
after filling, to see if it is really air-tight (if it is 
not the syrup or liquid will exude), in which case it 
can be put away. If, however, any liquid escapes, 
you will have to remove the lid (if the preserve is 
still hot), add more hot syrup, and re-fit the lid, 
after wiping it thoroughly. H, however, the bottle 
is cold before the leakage is discovered, you will have 
to turn out the contents of the bottle and re-boil 
them before returning them to the latter. But if 



10 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

yoTi have been careful to fill up the bottles brimful, 
and use patent bottles in good condition, this trouble 
should not occur. When stored look at them fre- 
quently for a week or two, and if you find the liquid 
has settled, and that there are no air-bubbles, you 
may set your mind at ease; the canned fruits are 
going to keep. If, however, the opposite is the case, 
fermentation has set in, and unless released, the 
bottles will burst. In this case open the bottles, 
turn out the fruit, and boil it up again, using it as 
soon as possible, as stewed fruit, pur^e, &c., for it is 
not satisfactory to attempt to keep fruit that has 
once tried to ferment. N.B. — ^If you do not use 
patent bottles, but simply wide-mouthed bottles 
corked with bladder-lined corks, or covered with 
bladder, melt some paraffin wax (which any chemist 
will supply) in a small pan at the side of the stove 
(a very low degree of heat will do), and after filling 
the bottle, and well wiping the rim with a damp 
cloth, pour in about a tables poonful of the wax, 
being careful not to touch the bottle again till this 
has set, when it will adhere to the glass and form a 
perfectly air-tight cover. (This paraffin can be lifted 
out of the bottle, well washed, dried, and used 
again.) The bottle can then be covered down in the 
usual way. Only remember in canning, bottling, or 
otherwise preserving anything, the jar mvst be air- 
tight, if its contents are to keep ; so never use paper 
as a cover, whether brown or white, no matter how 
1 .ny folds you use, for paj^er is not of itself air- 
rht. Another point must be noticed about 
ling, and that is the preparation of the 



OANNJNa AND BOTTLING. II 

bottles. For this wrap them in hay or old cloths, 
set them in a pan fall of cold water, and bring 
this slowlj to the boil; when it has well boiled up, 
lift the pan from the fire, or turn off the gas, and 
leave the bottles untouched in the water till 
thoroughly cold, when they can be taken out, dried, 
and put aside till wanted, bearing in mind that they 
must be well scalded out before pouring in the 
boiling fruit (or they would burst) ; a knife with a 
metal handle, or a silver fork, should be placed in the 
jar whilst filling it, to carry off some of the heat. 
Whilst filling, the glass jar should always be set on 
a damp, warm cloth, care being taken to fill up the 
hollow at the bottom of the jar with a wet towel. 
When you have filled the jars, lift them away care- 
fully into a warm comer of the kitchen where tbey 
are safe from any draught or current of air, till the 
next day, when they wUl be cold, and you will find 
you can give an extra turn to the screw lid. 

The second method (and one much used in the 
large canning factories), is to pare, core, and if 
necessary halve, the fruit, and then pack it as closely 
as possible into the glass jars, filling these up when 
so packed, with a syrup made by boiling half a pound 
of cane loaf sugar in a quart of water for fifteen 
minutes ; now set these bottles covered with the 
patent tops, but without the rubber ring, in a kettle 
full of tepid water, separating the bottles with old 
cloths or hay, to prevent their knocking together 
when the water in the kettle boils, cover the pan 
closely, bring the water gently to the boil, and keep 
it boiling till the fruit is done; now lift out the 



12 PICKLES AND PBESEBYES. 

bottles, standing them on a warm, wet towel, and 
after removing the lid of each singlj-, fill up directly 
with more boiling syrup, kept ready on the hob, and 
screw down tightly at once. Treat after this as in 
the previous recipe, being careful to test it to see 
if it is air-tight. 

Either fruit or vegetables can be done in this way, 
using boiled water instead of syrup, only of course 
it will take a considerably longer time. In syrup, 
berries and other small fruit will take ten to twelve 
minutes boiling to cook properly, whilst pears and 
such like will take two or three hours, according to 
their nature, and peaches or apricots will require 
from twenty to forty minutes ; but if water only is 
used, a longer time (quite double, in fact) must be 
allowed. If properly cooked, fruit will keep 
quite as well without, as with sugar, and for many 
purposes it is more suitable unsweetened. 

Be careful to remember that for all kinds of pre- 
serves and pickles, the fruit or vegetables must be 
gathered on a dry day, after the dew is off ; they 
must be perfect in condition, rather under than over 
ripe, and as even in size and shape as may be 
had. The liquid, whether syrup or water, in which 
they are preserved, must cover them thoroughly when 
bottled, and the bottles must be brimful. Fruit 
inferior in size and shape (but not in quality) can 
be used up for jam. It is difficult to give exact times 
for canning either fruit or vegetables, as seasons vary 
so much in this country ; either fruit or vegetables 
should, as a rule, be preserved when come to maturity, 

bhout being actually dead ripe ; if at all over ripe.

Artichoke Bmttamt, to BatUe, — Choose bottles jiist 
large enough to take the bottoms easily. Trim the 
artidiokes in the usual way, and boil them sharply

take only a few minutes), then scoop out the choke»

with the boiling salted water, which should covei 
them completely ; fasten on the lids, and boil as in 
the recipe for asparagus. Broad and French beans 
can be bottled in precisely the same way, only 
remember that the broad beans must be young, and 
that the French ones should be ''strung" as for 
ordinary boiling. Both should be parboiled, rinsed, 
and diained, and then finished off in the bottles 
with boiling salted water. 

Cardoons, to Bottle, — Choose white, and very sound 
<;ardoons, cut the inner leaves into three inch lengths, 
removing all the pricMy parts at the sides, blanch 
them for twenty minutes in salted water, then rinse, 
drain, and finish off as before. When wanted for use, 
they must be drained, and cooked in sauce, milk, &c., 
till tender, being careful only to simmer them. 
Cauliflowers can, if liked, be preserved in the same 
way, after well soaking and cleansing them, trimming 
them so that they stand upright in the bottle or jar. 
They also are finished off, when taken out, in 
sauce, &c. Celery and celeriac, trimmed as for 
cookii^, and parboiled, can be preserved in the 
fiame way. Celery is so useful in rheumatic cases 
that it is well worth bottling. Carrots, young 
turnips, &c., can all be bottled by these rules. 

€hreen Peas, to Bottle, — There are several ways of 
doing this. The regular way, as done by profes- 
sional canners, is I believe this : Gkither the peas on 
a dry day (as you must every other fruit or vegetable 
to preserve), shell them carefully, and pick them 
over to ensure their all being sound and perfect, and 
as even in size as possible; blanch them with a 



OANNINa AND BOTTLING. 15 

spray of mint, rinse, and dry well. Then put them 
into the bottles with the mint, shaking them to 
make them settle in nicely, pour salted boiling 
water over them, and after covering down, let them 
cook as before in a large kettle of water (remember 
that in every case the outside water should not 
reach above an inch from the rim of the bottle 
month) for one and a-half hours, and finish off as 
before. IL Shell, parboil, and drain the peas as 
before; pound the pods (they should be yoimg, 
though full formed) in some of the water in which 
the peas were boiled, and strain off the coloured 
liquid thus produced. Season to taste with salt, 
adding as much more water as will suffice to cover 
the peas, and boil it all together for ten or twelve 
minutes. Now put the peas into the bottles, cover 
them with the green water, and cook as before ; then 
fasten the tops down to make it all air-tight, and 
when cold store in a dry place, in. Gather and 
pick over the peas as before, and drop them carefully 
into the wide-mouthed preserving bottles so as to 
bruise them as little as possible, shake them gently 
to pack them close, and put on the cap of the bottle 
wittiout the rubber ring ; put the bottles swathed in 
hay into a kettle full of boiling water, again bring it 
gently to the boil, and keep this outer water simmer- 
ing, quietly but steadily, till the peas look tender ; 
then at once pour into the bottles boiling salted 
water (allow a teaspoonful of salt to each half gallon 
of water), and fasten down securely. Be careful to 
stand these bottles, when you take them out of the 
water, on a cloth wrung out of hot water, and keej» 



16 PICKLES AND PBESEBYES. 

them in a place where no current of air can touch 
them, or they maj burst. Myself, I prefer pouring 
a spoonful of oil in after the boiling water, to keep 
them air-tight, and leave them in the hot water till 
it has become stone cold (as this greatly diminishes 
the risk), and then make them air-tight. lY. An 
old-fashioned way, still trusted to in the country, is 
to gather and shell the peas as before, wipe them 
very gently on a clean soft doth till dry, then pack 
them as closely as possible in dry bottles, dose them 
down securely either with Eylands' air-tight tops, or 
with bladder, and then dip them in bottling wax ; 
after which they are buried in a cool dry comer of 
the garden. I have never tried this method myself, 
but as a child have often eaten peas preserved in 
this way. These peas require a little longer boiling 
than usual when to be served, and should have a 
small piece of butter put with them. 

Tomaioes, to Bottle, — Choose ripe, richly-coloured 
tomatoes, as much of a size as possible (do not 
choose abnormally large ones), and dip each for a 
minute in boiling water to allow of peeling off the 
skin easily ; then drain them well, allowing as much 
as possible of their own water to escape with the 
scalding water, but do not press them at all. Now 
put tbem in an enamel pan, bring them steadily to 
the boil, stirring them gently with a wooden spoon 
(be careful not to break or mash them), and allow 
them to boil steadily and untouched for about twelve 
minutes; then pour them boiling into the wide- 
mouthed patent bottles (which should have been 
oreviously scalded in boiling water and then 



CANNINa AND BOTTLING. 17 

drained), being careful to fill them until the juice 
runs light over ; then wipe the necks of the bottles 
very quickly and screw on the tops, screwing 
these down tighter as the contents cool ; when 
cold wipe the bottles well, test them to see that they 
are air-tight, and store in the coolest, driest, dark 
place available. Tomatoes can be bottled by any 
recipe given, and, indeed, can be preserved in a 
variety of ways. For instance, as conserve : Cut up 
41b. or 51b. good, sound tomatoes into small pieces, 
removing the stalks and any green parts, and cook 
them till perfectly tender with two onions (one stuck 
with three or four cloves and two bay leaves, salt 
and pepper to taste) ; then turn all the pulp on to 
a fine hair sieve, and when all the juice has flowed 
from them, put this into a pan and boil till reduced 
to half ; now pulp the rest of the tomatoes through 
the sieve (after removing the bay leaves and the 
onions), and mix the puree thus obtained with the re- 
duced juice, and put it all into wide-mouthed bottles, 
cover these down and stand them as before in a 
kettle of water, bring this to the boil, and keep it 
boiling for half an hour ; then either lift the pan off 
the fire (or, if on a ring, turn out the gas), and let 
the bottles stand in the water till the latter is stone 
cold ; then tighten up the cover, or cover the cork 
with bladder and bottle wax, and store as usual. 
Or it may be preserved as 3, puree : Take just ripe and 
richly-coloured tomatoes, and break (do not cut 
them) in two, place them in a pan on a slack 
fire, and crush the fruit well to get out all the juice, 
and to prevent their burning. When sufficient^

tender crusli it all-through a fine sieve (be sxire and 
keep back all the skin and pips), and then after 
seasoning this pulp with a little salt and pepper 
either pour it at once into hot, wide-mouhhed bottles, 
cork, and cook in the bain marie for haK an hour, 
and cork and store in the usual way ; or, return the 
pulp (after tammying) to the pan, and let it cook 
for half an hour, till it thickens to the consistency of 
peasoup or thick cream, and when cool put it in 
wide-mouthed, un glazed jars, and cover with oil, 
butter, or melted beef-suet ; tie down and store in a 
dry place. This will keep for years if properly made. 
Almost all vegetables can be bottled by the above 
directions, and keep admirably if care has been taken 
to see that the covers are air-tight, so that full 
advantage may be taken of a year of extra plenty. 
Vegetables also, if reduced to a puree and stored in 
unglazed jars, with a covering of melted beef suet, 
Ac, keep capitally. For instance, sorrel or spinach 
may either of them be preserved in this way: 
Remove the stalk and the spine or thread from 
the leaves, and boil up in a copper pan, till it has 
rendered all its liquid, then strain this off and 
return the puree of vegetable to the fire, and let it 
cook to a smooth pur^e; now turn it into wide- 
mouthed unglazed jars, smooth over the top, cover 
with paraffin wax, and cover down and store as usual. 
Endive, lettuce, &c., can be done in this way, but 
must first be broken up. The sorrel or spinach for 
this can be obtained by letting the bed grow after 
the first spring crop has been cleared off in the 
spring and then utilising the later crop. 



CANNING AND BOTTLING. 19 

Though French beans (like broad, or Windsor 
beans) can be perfectly bottled bj the previoas 
directions, the commonest method of preserving 
these most useful yegetables is this: Gather the 
French beans whilst joung, and on a fine day ; put 
a fairly thick layer of salt at the bottom of a large, 
unglazed earthenware jar, and cover with a layer of 
beans, then more salt, and repeat these two layers 
till the jar is full, finishing with the salt. Cover 
with a clean doth, lay a board on that, and lastly, a 
pretty heavy weight on that, to ensure its being air- 
tight. Be careful when taking out beans that the 
jar is carefully recovered, or they will not keep. To 
use them, wash them well when taken out, and then 
let them steep in soft water from twelve to twenty-four 
hours, changing the water pretty constantly. When 
boiled, do not salt them, but put a piece of butter 
with them, and season with lemon juice and white 
pepper. 

Again, it is not at all difficult to dry vegetables, 
and desiccated vegetables always form part of the 
winter stores abroad. For these, peel and shred 
fairly fine, potatoes, carrots, turnips, and such like, 
and boil them for five minutes in a wicker basket ; 
(if you are drying cauliflowers, endive, parsley, 
spinach, <&c., pick them over, and wash them well, 
then boil for five minutes) ; then rinse them all in 
cold water (iced if possible), drain them well and 
dry carefully on a clean cloth. When dry, spread 
the vegetables in thin layers on canvas frames, so 
that they do not stick together in lumps, and leave 
these frames in the oven for the night, in an ev^\^^

20 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

moderate heat, repeating this process till the vege- 
tables are quite dry and crisp. Then store them in 
glass bottles covered down till air-tight. Cabbages 
can also be kept in this way, but must be very care- 
fully cleansed and steeped, and then parboiled in 
fresh water. All bottled vegetables should be 
carefully strained from the water in which they 
were preserved, and then thoroughly rinsed in 
fresh boiling water, and again well drained; 
this helps to soften them before cooking, and 
entirely prevents any chance of a bitter taste 
sometimes given by l^e preserving water; a taste 
frequently noticeable in carelessly cooked preserved 
vegetables. 

The drying frames can easily be made at home, as 
they only consist of four thin laths nailed together 
to fit the oven, and then covered with coarse canvas 
or sacking strained over them. 

Mushrooms, though susceptible of exactly the same 
treatment as other vegetables, are preserved generally 
somewhat differently from other vegetables, there- 
fore, various methods are here given. Old-fashioned 
coimtry housewives preserve them thus : Choose large 
though still button mushrooms, and lay them on a 
sieve stalks uppermost, and sprinkle well with fine salt 
to get out the water. When well drained, put them 
in a deep jar, and set them for an hour in a cool oven, 
after which, take them up lightly, and lay them upon 
a dish to cool. Meantime, boil the liquor which will 
have receded from them, with a blade of mace, until 
reduced to half ; now put the mushrooms in a clean 
jar, and pour this reduced liquor (when cold) over 



CANNING AND BOTTUNG. 21 

them, cover with melted suet, and cover down ver j 
carefully. Or ; 

Wash and peel tlie mushrooms (cutting them in 
pieces if very large, removing the stalks), and blanch 
them in boiling water for two or three minutes (not 
longer) then strain well, and thread on a long, strong 
thread, keeping each separate, and then dry in the 
shade or a very moderate oven, and when perfectly 
dry store in air-tight tins tree from dust and damp. 
(Be sure the oven is not too hot, or the heat will 
utterly destroy the flavour of the mushrooms). To 
cook mushrooms preserved thus, soak them for half- 
an-hour in vinegar and water, and then flnisb off in 
any way you choose. Or, put a thin layer of salt at 
the bottom of an unglazed jar, and lay in the mush- 
rooms, then more salt, and finish off: as for the 
French beans in salt. Or : 

Pack well wiped, perfect, even-sized and shaped 
mushrooms, in wide- mouthed glass bottles, not too 
tightly, sprinkling them with a little finely minced 
shallot; then cover them completely with light 
white (Prencb or German) wine, cook and boil for 
half an hour in the bain-marie. Let them stand till 
perfectly cold in the water they are cooked in, then 
wipe, screw down tightly, and store. Or : wipe the 
mushrooms very clean, taking out the brown, and 
paring off the skin of the large ones ; lay them on 
paper, and set them in a cool oven to dry, then store 
in paper bags. When wanted for use, simmer them 
very slowly in good gravy, and they will swell out to 
very nearly their original size. If after drying in 
this way the mushrooms are crushed to a fine powde,T

in a mortar, and kept in tightly corked and sealed 
(small) bottles, this powder will be a great addition 
to sauces, <&c. 

Or lastly, a yerj satisfactory essence of mush/rooms 
can be made thus : Wash and peel the mushrooms 
and cut them up small ; place a layer a quarter of an 
inch thick of this mince in a new earthenware jar* 
sprinkling it with fine salt, and fill up the jar in this 
way ; now press it down with a light weight (the 
best way is to slip a reversed saucer into the jar, and 
stand the weight on that), and next day pound it all 
together, and let it stand for forty-eight hours 
(stirring it well up eyery six hours) till it becomes a 
pur^ ; add to this black pepper and a little mustard 
seed, and boil for three hours in the bain-marie. 
Now run it through a fine wire sieve, let it stand for 
a little, then decant the clear part off very carefully. 
Be careful not to shake the bottle, and add a spoon- 
ful of spirit of some kind at the last, before corking 
and sealing down tightly. 

I may add here the recipe for a mustard-like paste, 
which is, abroad, considered an immense addition to 
mushrooms in any shape : Blanch and pound almonds 
in a mortar with a little water, olive oil, lemon- juice, 
a suspicion of garlic, and a few black peppercorns 
till of the consistency of thick mustard 



CHAPTER in. 

CANNING AND BOTTLINa 
{Gontinued). 

Needless almost to say that the rules given for 
canning vegetables apply equally to fruit, which can 
be bottled either with sugar syrup or plain water, as 
the operator chooses, only bearing in mind that in 
the latter case they require far more boiling than in 
the former, or rather it should be said cooking, for 
as they must always be treated on the bain-marie 
plan, the contents of the bottles themselves never 
actually get beyond simmering point. We may 
briefly recapitulate the two methods of bottling, then 
proceed to individual recipes. The fruit must be in 
perfect condition, gathered on a warm, dry day, 
halved, stoned, and peeled, as may be required (this 
is for such fruit as pears, apricots, &c.), and then 
are either cooked in syrup and poured, as explained 
before, boiling hot into the bottles, and at once 
securely fastened up by screwing on the cap to its 
uttermost, if the patent bottles are used; or by 
stretching a bladder damped in a little spirit over 
the mouth of the bottle, then forcing in the cork as 
tightly as possible, and lastly covering it all over 
closely with more damp bladder, or by dipping the 
top or neck of the bottle into bottling wax. (This 



24 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

wax can be bought all ready, if necessaiy, but if it 
must be borne made, mix together one pound each of 
beeswax and resin with half a pound of tallow, 
melting it all together, colouring it with either red 
or yellow ochre, as you please, and stirring it till 
thoroughly amalgamated). The other method con- 
sists in laying the fruit raw, but prepared by peeling, 
coring, &c., as above, into the bottles, filling these up 
with either syrup or water, and finishing, as described 
above, in the bain-marie. The first method is recom- 
mended, especially if plain water is used, as preserving 
the taste of the fruit more perfectly. The fruit pre- 
served in syrup make delicious dessert dishes, for 
Winter use, but for this purpose they require some- 
what different treatment. Select rich, ripe, stone 
fruit of any kind ; if large they must be carefully 
stoned by slipping the stone out with a corer or a 
small knife, preserving the shape as much as possible ; 
if small the stones can be left in, but then the fniit 
must be pricked through and through with a darning 
needle. As you stone or prick them, drop them into 
a pan of cold water, and when all are done set this 
pan on the fire and bring the water just to 
the boil, lifting it off the fire at once just as it is on 
boiling point ; lift out the fruit with a skimmer as 
they rise to the surface of the water, and again drop 
them into cold water, rinse, and drain on a sieve. 
Have ready a plain syrup made with two parts of 
sugar to one of water, brought to the boil, allowed 
to boil for a minute, then well skinmied, returned to 
the fire and gently boiled imtil on dipping the finger 
and thumb into cold water and then into tiie syrup, a 



CANNING AND BOTTLING. 25 

thread forms, whicli can be stretched some way before 
snapping ; lay the fruit into the sjrup at this point, 
and boil up once geutlj, then lift the pan from the 
fire, skim carefully, and pour syrup and fruit into an 
earthenware basin, and leave it till next day ; then 
drain ofE the sjrup, add a little more sugar, and 
again boil to the" pearl " till the thread will stretch a 
little further before snapping, and again boil up the 
fruit as before. Repeat this exactly for five days 
more, then on the sixth day boil the sugar till you 
can stretch your finger and thumb to the uttermost 
without breaking the thread, boil the fruit up again 
and bottle and cork down at once. They will keep 
in this syrup for a long time ; when wanted for 
dessert purposes lift them from the bottles, drain for 
a little on a sieve, then place them on pastry racks, 
or trays, in the oven, till dry or glaces. Or they may 
be drained in this way, and then dipped in sugar 
boiled to the crack (i.e., till on dropping a little into 
cold water it will harden at once and fall with a little 
tinkle like glass, or if bitten will break crisp and 
hard), and then left to dry on oiled slabs. Preserved 
in this way they are extremely nice, but do not keep 
good for more than a few days at the outside. 

Soft fruit, such as strawberries, &c., must not be 
boiled in the syrup, but only need the boiling syrup 
(brought to the proper degree) poured over them. 
Of course as strict attention must be paid to the tight 
closing of the bottles containing these fruits as for 
any other bottled fruit. 

Again fruit is often preserved in brandy, with 
excellent efEect. This may be done in two ways 



26 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

either the fruit is bottled in syrup as before, to which 
brandy or spirit to taste is added, or else the fruit 
after preparation, is laid in the bottles, with brandy 
enough to cover them, corked down tightly and left 
for a month, after which the brandv is strained off 
and mixed with sugar candy in the proportion of 4oz. 
of the crushed candy to each pint of the brandy 
when this is thoroughly melted, it is all strained 
through flannel till bright and clear, and then 
returned to the fruit (being careful there is enough 
to cover them well), and they are then ready for use, 
but will keep for a long time. 

Another form of bottled dried fruit is one seen 
abroad, in which the fruit is reduced to powder. It 
is prepared thus : stalk any fruit, such as currants, 
cherries, &c., and remove the stones, then crush them 
till every drop of juice is extracted ; tammy this, and 
for each part of juice allow from four to six parts of 
very white (cane) loaf sugar, crushed and sifted. 
Stir the juice and sugar together till you obtain a 
granular kind of paste ; dry this slowly but 
thoroughly in the stove, then crush to powder and 
store in very clean, dry and tightly corked bottles. 
A spoonful of this fruit sugar dissolved in a glass 
of iced or aerated water makes a most refreshing 
drink in hot weather. 

Lastly, there is bottled fruit pulp, which is very 
easily prepared, and will enable one to have 
apparently fresh fruit pur^e all the year roimd. 
For this choose perfectly ripe (but not the least 
over ripe) fruit, freshly gathered on a dry, hot day, 

ad pulp this fruit, raw, through a delicately clean 



CANNING AND BOTTLING. 27 

and freshly scalded, but quite dry, tainmy or fine 
sieve, and pack this pulp into clean, dry, wide- 
mouthed bottles (but without any sugar), cork these 
down tightly, covering the bottles with moistened 
bladder ; set these bottles in a kettleful of cold water, 
well up to the shoulders of the bottles, bring this 
water very gently to the boil, and keep it boiling 
steadily for twenty-minutes ; then lift the kettle o^ 
the fire or turn off the gas, and let it all stand till 
the next day, when the bottles may be lifted out, well 
wiped, and stored in a dry place. Any fruit pulp 
can be preserved in this way, and is deliciously fresh 
to taste. 

The above directions, if carefully carried out, will 
answer for almost all fruit, so that many individual 
directions are needless ; still a few may be given as 
typical of the various kind of preserving. 

Apricots, Sc.f to bottle. — The following is a French 
recipe, and if followed exactly, answers admirably 
for apricots, peaches, greengages, &e., and even 
cherries. Have ready good, wide-mouthed, very 
clean and dry bottles ; fill these with fruit, then into 
each bottle shake lightly about Jib. of caster sugar, 
cork the bottles down tightly, and place them in a 
large kettle or pan, sepai-ated by hay bands or old 
cloths, and packed as closely as may be. Fill the 
kettle with cold water, set it on the fire, and bring it 
gently lo the boil ; as soon as the water really boils 
draw the pan to the side of the stove and let it cool, 
and when perfectly cold, lift out the bottles, wipe 
and seal them up, and stand them upright in a cool 
place. The fruit for this purpose should be just 



28 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

in perfection, and at the point when the stalks can 
be easily lifted out. 

Strawberries to bottle. — Choose sound (not too 
ripe, but richly coloured) fruit, as even in size as 
possible ; pack them carefully and closely in 
delicately clean, wide-mouthed bottles, then pour on 
to them some very clear, plain syrup, till the bottles 
are three-quarters full and the fruit thoroughly 
covered. Cork the bottles down closely, and cook in 
the bain-marie in the usual way, putting them on in 
oold water, and bringing this slowly to 200 deg., 
when the pan is drawn aside, and the bottles left im- 
touched till the next day ; they are then lifted out, 
wiped, sealed, and stored in straw, necks downwards, 
in a dry place. Or : Choose the fruit as before, and 
fill the bottles closely with the fruit, then cork 
closely, covering the corks with damp bladder, 
tightly tied down ; now cook in the bain-marie in 
the ordinary way, bringing the cold water gently 
to the boil, and then allowing it to boil for fifteen 
to twenty minutes, finish and store as in the pre- 
ceding recipe. The bottles must be looked at daily, 
and the fruit gently but well shaken together for 
just three weeks — this ensures their keeping. If 
the bladder on the corks blister while cooking rub 
it smooth with your moistened finger. Do not pre- 
serve fruit in this way in too large bottles, as, once 
opened, the contents must be used up at once. Also 
be very careful to have the bottles perfectly dry be- 
fore using them. To ensure this, the instant before 
they are filled, hold them neck down, and hold two or 
pee lighted matches in the bottle, being careful 



CANNING AND BOTTLmG. 2^ 

to drop in the fruit at once before the yapour 
escapes. 

Bottled Fruit (wUliout sugar) far Tarts. — Choose 
fine (bnt not overripe) fruit, stalk and stone them if 
aecessarj, and pnt them into bottles, filling these 
well up ; then cork them up securely, and place thenk 
in a kettle as in the preceding recipe, and gradually 
heat the water to 200 deg. ; then withdraw the heat 
(a gas riug, or a good lamp stove, are handiest for 
these preserves), and leave the bottles in the kettle- 
till next day, when they may be lifted out, wiped dry, 
sealed down, and stored in straw (necks down) in a 
dry place. Currants, gooseberries, raspberries, 
strawberries, Ac., may all be preserved in this way ; 
but special care must be taken in choosing the soft 
fruit, snch as strawberries, raspberries, &c., not to 
have it too ripe, or it will go to a mash and probably 
mould. Fruit for this purpose must be gathered on 
a warm, dry day. 

Fruit Juice, to Preserve. — Fruit juice can be pre- 
pared in precisely the same way as the fruit, i.e., 
wring all the juice attainable from the fruit, bottle, 
and boil in the bain-marie for twenty minutes, then 
finish off jnst like the other recipes. Sugar may be 
added to Uie bottle, but the usual plan is not to add 
it till the juice is to be used. This j uice is particularly 
good for ices. 

Fruit in Brandy. — Take any stone fruit, such aa 
apricots, plnms, peaches, Ac (which, though full 
grown, should not be dead ripe), prick them all over 
with a needle, and blanch them sufficiently long to- 
make them soft. (This requires care, for, though 



30 PICKLES AND PRESERYES. 

tender, they must not be too soft, as if for compete, 
when the skin must be thoroughly softened.) When 
the fruit is ready it will rise to the surface, and must 
then be lifted out with a skimmer and dropped into 
<X)ld fresh water, well rinsed, and then drained on a 
sieve. Meanwhile, make a syrup by boiling sugar 
and water (in the proportion of two parts of sugar 
to one of water) together for a minute after the sugar 
is thoroughly dissolved, then lifting it off from the 
fire and skimming it carefully ; now return it to the 
fire and let it boil till, on dipping your finger and 
thumb into cold water and then into the syrup, 
jou can stretch them to the uttermost without 
breaking the thread that will form between them ; 
then run it all through the jelly bag to clear it. 
(This syrup, if frequently wanted, can be made in 
large quantities and bottled off for use as required.) 
Now lay the well-drained fruit into this syrup, give 
it one boil up, then lift it off the fire, and measure 
the syrup ; mix this with the best brandy, allowing 
two parts brandy to one part syrup, put the fruit 
into wide-mouthed bottles, pour the brandied syrup 
over them, being careful to have them thoroughly 
covered, and when cold cork down the bottles as 
securely as possible. Pears preserved in this way 
Are very delicious, but, after blanching and rinsing in 
cold water, must have their rinds taken off very 
thinly, and be again pricked to the core, and once 
more rinsed, drained, and finished off precisely as in 
the preceding recipe. Fine juicy eating pears should 
be chosen for this purpose. 

Cherries in Brandy. — Choose large, well coloured. 



CANNING AND BOTTLING. 31 

perfect, and not oyer-ripe fruit, cut the stalks half 
an inch from the fruit, and then arrange the latter 
in wide-mouthed bottles. Now dissolve good cane 
loaf sugar, broken small, in brandy, using a pint of 
brandy for every 21b. of sugar, mix it thoroughly, 
and when perfectly melted pour it on to the cherries, 
being careful to cover them thoroughly. Cork the 
bottles very tightly to make them airtight, and store 
them in a very cool place. A clove or two, or a piece 
of stick cinuamoD may be put into each bottle with 
the fruit. 

Walnuts in Brandy. — Choose the walnuts before 
they are altogether ripe, and peel them carefully to 
keep them as whole as possible, throwing them into 
cold water as you peel them. Now bring some water 
to the boil, throwing in the nuts, but be careful to 
lift the pan from the fire the moment you see it is 
going to boil up again, then drain them off into 
more cold water, acidulated with a little lemon juice 
(use enough lemon juice to give the water a notice- 
able but not too strong acid flavour), meanwhile, 
boil some good cane sugar to the small thread (i.e., 
till on dipping your finger and thumb into cold 
water, and then into the sugar, you can draw out a 
tiny thread between them), drain the nuts, place 
them in a basin, pour the boiled sugar on them, and 
leave them in this for the night. Next day strain off 
the sugar, again boil it up till on testing it as before, 
it will form a longer thread than the first time, before 
it snaps ; again let the nuts stand in this for a night; 
next day boil the sugar again till the thread will be 
longer still, and again leave them a fourth night, 



32 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

wlien you again boil up the sugar till on testing it, 
you can stretch your finger and thumb to their very 
widest without breaking the thread ; now put the 
nuts in a pan, and pour on to them the syrup mixed 
with an equal quantity of good brandy, place it on 
the fire and let it heat just short of boiling point; 
then fill up the bottles with the fruit and brandied 
syrup in such a way that the nuts will float in the 
liquid, and cork down closely. "Walnuts prepared 
in this way are considered abroad an excellent 
stomachic, and as of very easy digestion. The 
inner peels, cut aAvay from the nuts for this pre- 
paration, are also utilised abroad in this way: 
Rinse them weU in fresh cold water, then drain, 
and lastly dry them gently in a clean cloth (remember 
that this cloth will be hopelessly stained, so do not 
use a good one). Now place them in bottles, with a 
few pieces of lump sugar, or better still sugar candy, 
fill up the bottles with good brandy, cork down 
closely, and store in a cool place. This is considered 
an excellent digestive, and invaluable in cases of 
colic. A liqueur-glassful is a dose. 

Figa in Syrup. — Choose nicely coloured, but not 
quite ripe, figs (those that form the second crop in 
England, and never entirely ripen, are excellent for 
this), prick them all over, dropping each as done 
into cold water, and finish off exactly as described in 
the recipe for dessert fruits at the beginning of this 
chapter. 

Green Oranges in Syrup (Chinois), — Choose nice 
well- shaped and even- sized green oranges such 

one frequently gets on greenhouse orange-trees. 



CANNING AND BOTTLING. 33 

and proceed exactly as for the other fruit. Some 

people extract the core first by means of a quill. 

These, when either frosted by drying in the oven, or 

by glazing with boiled sugar as before described, are 

favourite decorations for French gateaux under the 

name of chinoia. 

Chestnuts in Syrup, and glazed. — Choose* large, 

perfect nuts, and remove the outer skin carefully ; 

then blanch them in boiling water till you (ran easily 

pierce them with a needle; now remove the inner 

skin, and drop each nut as done into warm acidulated 

water ; meanwhile prepare a plain syrup as before, 

and when this is ready, drain the nuts, put them 

into it, and allow it all to simmer very gently 

together till they are tender, and the syrup is quite 

thick; they are then bottled, corked down, and 

stored as usual. If wanted for use, drain them on a 

sieve, boil some syrup to " the crack," and just 

before it is perfectly cold, work it against the sides 

of the pan with a wooden spoon till it whitens, dip 

the chestnuts into this singly with a skewer, and 

dry in the oven on trays. As marrona glacea do not 

keep well, it is more thrifty to store them in the 

syrup, and finish them off as above, just as they are 
needed for use. 



CHAPTEE IV. 

JAMS, JELLIES AND PASTES. 

Like many other dainties which aforetime were 
always home made, jam has now come to be far 
more often bought than prepared from one's own 
fruit in one's own kitchen. Still, it must be admitted 
that connoisseurs 'regret the old fashion, which, they 
said, ensured far greater flavour than is now 
obtainable in any save the very highest (and, con- 
sequently, most expensive) class of bought goods. 
How far this increased flavour is worth the trouble 
it entails in towns is open to question, though more 
than one London housekeeper we wot of prides her- 
self on her cupboard of really home-made preserves. 
However, the trouble of procuring fruit in proper 
condition, a cook who really understands the work, &c., 
is in most cases prohibitory to the town mouse. The 
same remarks, however, certainly do not apply to the 
country housekeeper, who has the fruit in her garden 
for the gathering ; a range which may be utilised at 
certain times of the day when it is not required for 
other cooking and yet must be kept in ; leisure for 
the manufacture, and room to store it when made ; 
so that the whole expense lies in the jars and the 
sugar, both cheap enough in these days, even when 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 35 

housewifery and patriotism combined make us insist 
on pure cane sugar from our own colonies, and give 
us tlie determination necessary to ensure our getting 
the class of sugar we ask for ! ^<^ 

Where jam and preserve-making is a regular part 
of the housekeeping, a small outfit should be kept 
strictly for this purpose and none other. It need be 
neither costly nor extensive. A copper or bell-metal 
preserving pan (or, failing this, an enamelled one ; 
but these, though cheaper to begin with, are not 
really so economical, as they are so apt to bum and 
chip, and in either case are then unfit for delicate 
jam-making), a couple of fine hair sieves, two or 
three squares of coarse delicately clean muslin, three 
or four wooden spoons of varying size and length, 
such is the complete list. To these, however, may 
be added, if preferred, a small lamp or gas stove, 
both to save using the kitchen range, and also 
because in this case the heat is more easily and 
quickly regulated ; while, if the mistress is her own 
jam maker, a large silver or best plate spoon or two 
may be advised. Eemember that neither tin, iron, 
nor pewter should touch jam on pain of spoiling the 
colour of the preserve. Please also bear in mind that 
the cai'dinal rule in jam-making is perfect and minute 
cleanliness. Every utensil or apparatus used must 
be absolutely clean and sweet. The sugar used must 
be pure cane (cheap sugar is one of the worst 
economies (?) ever devised, destructive alike to the 
appearance, flavour, and the keeping powers of any 
preserve made with it) ; the fruit must be just in 
perfection, neither over nor under-ripe, gathered ow

a dry, and if possible, sunny day, and be carefully 
picked over that there may be no imperfect or 
damaged fruit amongst it. Moreover, the fruit, if 
not used at once, must be kept in a cool place, weU 
sheltered from dust. With regard to putting the 
sugar and fruit into the pan opinions vary. Some 
persons put in both together ; others, again, boil the 
sugar first, and then lay in the fruit (this, by the way, 
is the best plan, if you wish to keep the fruit whole) ; 
but, perhaps, the safest plan, on the whole, is to 
bring the fruit to the boil by itseK first, and then put 
in the sugar (which should have been warmed, butl 
not dissolved), as the keeping powers of the jam 1 
depend greatly on the thorough boiling of the fruit, 1 
which may take some little time ; yet, if you have \ 
the sugar boiling all the time, it will sometimes 
become quite sticky, and what old cooks call "tacky,'* 
a result always due to the overboiling of the sugar. 
Again, if the fruit is not boiled sufficiently it will 
neither jelly nor set, and indeed, will almost certainly 
ferment. It is said that boiling up the fruit first, 
without the sugar, is a sure preventive of fermen- 
tation, and is decidedly to be recommended if jam 
has necessarily to be made in damp, muggy weather. 
As a general rule, the fruit and sugar should boil 
together from ten to fifteen minutes, but never 
longer than twenty minutes — in fact, when the fruit 
has been first boiled up alone, the shortest period 
mentioned is the best, But the safest plan is always 
to try the jam (after skimming it till no more scum 
rises), by dropping a little on to a plate, and if in 
about a minute it has jellied enough to be too stifE 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 37 

to run easily, it should be at once put into pots. 
Jam must always be boiled fast, as slow cooking in- 
variably spoils the colour, and, as long as fruit and 
sugar are being cooked tog-ther, the preserving p,9in 
must not be left. The jam must be kept constantly 
and gently stirred the whole time it is cooking, and 
the scum must be carefully removed as it rises. The 
difficulty about jam making for the beginner is that 
experience is indispensable, as the fruit varies so 
much each year that no hard and fast rules can be 
given. Again, remember that, if the fruit is boiled 
before adding the sugar, it must be carefully watched, 
for, if allowed to thicken too much, the sugar, when 
added, will neither melt properly, nor throw up its 
scum as it should do, and in some seasons when the 
fruit is very good the juice thickens up almost in a 
minute, so attention is needed. It must be re- 
membered that these directions are given on the 
understanding that the best cane sugar is used. 
Inferior sugar takes longer, as it throws up far more 
scum than the best clarified sugar will do, and this 
in itself is a waste, as a certain proportion of jam is 
bound to rise with the scum, and so be wasted. 

The question as to quantities is another very | 
anxious one for the beginner. The old rule was 
equal weights of fruit and sugar, and this is, on the 
whole, a very safe one ; but in these days many per- I 
sons consider jam made in these proportions too / 
luscious, and prefer three quarters of a pound of ; 
sugar to the one pound of fruit, and in this case the l 
rule of boiling up the fruit well before adding the [ 
sugar, should be strictly adhered to. Another point ». 

\ 



38 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

is that dry fruit requires the addition of a little 
liquid when first put into the preserving pan to keep 
it from burning, and of this the usual allowance is 
about a gill to the pound of fruit. Personally, I 
prefer a little rhubarb juice to the water recom- 
mended by some people. This juice is easily 
prepared by wiping, paring, and cutting up the 
stalks of rhubarb, then laying them on a dish, 
strewed with sugar, for an hour or so, to draw out 
the juice, the whole being then turned into a pre- 
serving pan, and heated very slowly and gradually 
till the juice is all drawn out ; when it is strained 
and is ready for use ; this juice imparts little or no 
flavour to the fruit, yet is richer than plain water. 
Few people, by-the-way, know what an improvement 
a finely sliced stick of rhubarb is to almost any fruit 
tart, such as cherry, &c., improving both the quality 
and the quantity of the juice. Lastly, remember 
that the fire for jam making should be clear and 
strong, but not fierce, and on no account should the 
preserving pan rest directly on the fire itself, but 
should be placed on a trivet over the grate. 

A^ regards potting jam, authorities differ, some 
people declaring it must not be touched till jam and 
pots are alike cold ; others, again, that it never keeps 
so well as when poured boiling hot into the pots and 
covered oven at once, before it has time to cool. A 
round of white paper cut to "fit the pot, and dipped in 
brandy, or spirit of some kind, then laid on the jam 
before covering down the pot with either parchment, 
bladder, Ac, is most conducive to the welfare of the 
jam, wliich, if properly made and carefully covered. 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 39 

win keep without deteriorating for three or four 
years, or eren longer. I remember eating some jam 
wldch had been made very nearly five years, and 
certainly it could compare favourably with any 
otker. 

Jam to keep well must be stored in a cool, dry 
pkce, free from draughts, and from any sudden 
changes of temperature — the evener the latter, the 
better the jam will keep. It is advisable when 
patting up jam to paste labels with the name of the 
jam and the date of its making on the sides of the 
jars, for when stored the names, if written, as they 
often are, on the top covering, are not visible, and so 
a good deal of confusion may anse. Be very careful 
when pouring the jam into the pots to keep the 
latter as free from splashes as possible, and if by 
any accident any is spilt, wipe it off at once with a 
d£unp cloth rung out of hot water ; the importance 
of attention to this point is that, if not wiped off at 
once it cools and hardens quickly, and is then not 
easy to remove ; and if the cover by any chance gets 
moistened by the stickiness thus left, the contents of 
the pot are very likely not to keep. 

The above are general rules applicable to all jams, 
but common sense must be used in applying them. 
For instance, jams, or marmalades as the French call 
thera, should be cooked a little before adding the 
sugar ; the same rule applies to jellies, which should 
be cooked first to extract the juice, and when tender 
shoidd be drained through a fine sieve or jelly bag, 
and then boiled quickly with the requisite amount of 
sugar. But if the fruit is to be kept whole, either 



40 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

the sugar should be dissolved before putting in the 
fruit, or the latter should be cooked in a syrup made 
of fruit juice and sugar. The following will give an 
idea of this process : Have ready your fruit, whetter 
strawberries, black currants, apricots, &c., as you 
please, and pick out a certain proportion of the 
finest ; weigh these and put them in a pan sprinkled 
with an equal weight of fine preserving sugar (he 
careful when doing this to sprinkle the sugar in 
gradually in layers with the fruit, so as not to crusii 
the latter), and leave them thus till next day. Ir 
the meantime take the rest of the fruit, together with 
some peeled and sliced stalks of rhubarb, and cook 
it all gently in a covered jar till the juice has flowed 
freely from it, then place it in a sieve and strain off 
all the liquid possible. Now take this juice and pour 
it over the sweetened fruit previously set aside, and 
leave this to soak together for another twenty-f«.ur 
hours, allowing from one to two gills to each pound 
ot the preserved fruit, the quantity of added juice 
depending a great deal on whether the preserve is to 
be very juicy or not ; now pour off all the juice which 
will have appeared, and put it on to boil with an 
equal weight of pure cane suear, allowing it to boil 
up rapidly, and, when it does, lay in the whole fruit, 
and boil altogether for twelve to fifteen minutes, 
stirring it very gently (not to break the fruit), and 
removing every particle of scum as it rises. This 
preserve is well worth the trouble it involves, for the 
fruit will be found quite firm and plump, as well as 
tender, while the syrup round it will be of a creamy 
consistency, delicious both in richness of flavour and

least touch of "ropiness" — given by over-boiled 
sugar. Take for instance : 

Bed Currant Jelly. — For every 21b. of red currants 
take lib. of white (mind they are ripe and very juicy, 
and carefully stripped from their stalks) ; place 
these in the preserving pan, and keep them well- 
stirred over the fire, to make them render their juice 
freely ; as soon as they have done so, pour it off, and 
weigh it and for each quart of juice take If lb. of cane 
loaf sugar, broken into fairly large pieces, dip these 
into cold water, and throw them, when well drenched, 
into a pan and boil them to a thick syrup, stirring it 
all well together till it " drapes " the skimmer, and 
falls in thick folds from it. Now pour in the juice 
at once, stir it all well together, and, when well 
blended, let it all boil together sharply for five 
minutes ; then skim most carefully, and pour it into 
glasses which have been previously scalded and 
dried. 

White Currant Jelly. — Choose very fine and deli- 
cately white currants for this (gathered on a warm, 
dry day), and remove the stalks very carefully. To 
each pound of fruit allow lib. 2oz. best cane loaf 
sugar, and boil these together very quickly for seven 
or eight minutes, then turn it out on to a delicately 
clean sieve, and allow all the juice to dram from it, 
putting this into small jars, which must be left in a 
cool, dry place till cold. Red currants can be made 
into jelly in the same way, only using equal weights 
of fruit and sugar. This makes a delicious jelly 
though its stiffness cannot be depended on if the 
weather be cold, and, above all, damp. 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 43 

B41W Currant Jelly. — Crush the juice from fine, 
full-ripe, red currants with a new wooden spoon 
through a delicately clean sieve. For each pint of 
this juice take a pound of double-refined cane loaf 
sugar, broken and dipped till saturated with cold 
water, and boiled to candy (i.e., till almost back to 
sugar again) ; then lift the pan from the fire, pour 
the currant juice to it, stirring it in quickly till it is 
all well mixed, then at once pour into small glass 
jars, and let these stand for a fortnight (before 
covering down) in a dry place, or in the sun, with 
just a paper laid over them to keep off the dust ; then 
bladder them down, but on no account put any 
paper next the jelly, or it will crust the top. This is 
an old family recipe, over 100 years old, and jelly 
made by it has often kept for ten or twelve years. 

StroAvherry Jelly. — Place the freshly gathered and 
stalked fruit in the preserving-pan over a clear slow 
fire ; let the juice flow freely, stirring it all now and 
again with a silver or new wooden spoon, till it has 
been pretty well all extracted ; then allow it to simmer 
gently for twenty-five to thirty minutes (but no 
longer, or it would thicken too much) ; now strain 
off the juice, weigh it, and then again boil it up 
sharply for twelve to fifteen minutes, stirring it 
constantly. Then lift the pan from the fire, and mix 
in, little by little, 12oz. of cane sugar to each pint of 
juice, being careful each lot is dissolved before tha 
next is added in. When the juice and sugar are 
thoroughly blended, return the pan to the fire, and 
boil it sharply together till it will jelly when lifted 
the spoon« 



4i PICKLES ANB PRESERYES. 

Gr^uava Jelly (ifocA;^.— Stew some perfectly ripe 
medlars in a stewpan, well covered with water, till 
thoroughly cooked (this will take several hours), 
when they must be turned into a jelly bag and the 
juice allowed to run through at its leisure, without 
the slightest pressure. When it has all run through, 
weigh it, and boil with an equal weight of broken 
up cane loaf sugar till quite clear, keeping it well 
stirred and skimmed ; as it cools, pour it into glass 
jars, and when cold it should be a firm stiff jelly. 

Quince Jelly, — Peel, halve, and core the fruit, 
weigh it, and take a pint of cold spring water to 
every pound of fruit, dropping the latter into this as 
quickly as possible ; let it all simmer together till the 
fruit is broken, but not mashed, or the colour will be 
ruined. Now run it all through the jelly bag at its 
leisure, being careful not to press or meddle with it 
in any way while the juice is running through ; when 
all the juice is extracted, weigh it, and boil in a 
delicately clean preserving pan for fifteen to twenty- 
minutes, then for each pint of juice, when weighed, 
add three-quarters to one pound of cane loaf sugar 
(according to the ripeness and sweetness of the fruit), 
and boil it all up together again for ten or fifteen 
minutes, keeping it most carefully skimmed. Directly 
it jellies on the spoon pour it into pots or moulds. 
Quince Jam is a very good preserve, prepared thus : 
procure some juice as above from inferior fruit, then 
add haK a pint of this juice to each pound of fruit, 
weighed after peeling, halving, and coring, and finish 
off in the usual way. Quince Paste, — ^A most 

licious dessert paste can be prepared thus : Take a 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 45 

little of the jelly as in the first recipe, and in this 
stew some peeled, halved, and cored fruit till soft 
enough to pulp through a sieve when cool. Replace 
this pulp over a very clear fire and keep it well stirred 
till it becomes thick and dry. Weigh this paste, 
add to it an equal weight of (cane) caster sugar 
and stir this all together over the fire till it 
"balls,'* leaving the sides of the pan, and clinging to 
the spoon. Spread this paste out on shallow tins, 
and as soon as it is cool cut it up into any shapes 
you please and dry these in a slack oven, afterwards 
storing them in an air-tight tin. (N.B.- Almost any 
fruit can be made into a paste thus, though for very 
juicy fruit, such as currants, &c., the fruit from 
which jelly is made answers admirably If all the 
juice has not been drawn away.) 

Elderberry Jelly. — Strip the berries from their 
stalks and stir them over the fire with a new wooden 
spoon till the juice flows freely; then strain it off 
thoroughly, though without in any way touching or 
handling the jelly bag (which would make it thick 
and cloudy), weigh it, and boil up sharply for fifteen 
to twenty minutes ; next add in, off the fire, 14oz. 
cane caster sugar to every pint of juice, and boil it 
all together for fifteen minutes, stirring and skim- 
ming it carefully, till it jellies. If the fruit is dry, a 
very little water may be boiled with it in the first 
place. (This is a Grerman recipe, and is much used 
abroad for colds, coughs, &c.) 

Cranberry Jelly. — Well wash the berries in several 
waters, then drain them roughly and lay them into 
the preserving pan, with half a pint of water to each

pound of fruit. Boil gently for half an hour, stirring 
and skimming well. Now run off the juice, weigh it, 
and to each pint allow lib. of sugar, and boil it 
all together till it jellies. Pot as usual. Some 
people add a few drops of carmine to bring up the 
colour. 

Tomato Jelly. — Quarter the fruit, and run out the 
juice in the preserving pan over a clear fire, and 
finish off in the usual way. (This is a Texan recipe, 
and is delicious with cold meat.) Tomato Jam is 
easily made by peeling, quartering, and coring ripe, 
sound, and well-coloured tomatoes, boiling them with 
an equal weight of sugar, and, when this jellies, 
potting it as usual. 

Rowan (or Mountain Ash Berry) Jelly. — Put the 
ripe red berries in the preserving pan with just 
•enough water to keep them from burning (about 
haK a pint to every 21b. of berries), and simmer this 
all, stirring and breaking the berries up with a spoon 
to make the jeUy flow freely. When they are quite 
soft and well broken up, turn them into a jelly bag, 
and run off as usual ; let it run just as slowly as it 
likes, without handling. Weigh this juice, and 
return it to the pan, with lib. of sugar to each pint 
of juice, and boil for nearly an hour, or till it 
** geals." (Scotch recipe.) 

Apple Jelly. — Wipe, quarter, stalk, and core the 

apples, also wipe a good stalk of rhubarb and cut it 

into pieces, then place both these into the preserving 

pan with two pints of water for 41b. of apples and a 

^ood stick of rhubarb ; boil it all gently together for 

en minutes, or until the apples are quite in a 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTEa 47 

maith ; now turn it into the jellj bag and finish off 
preciflelj as for other jellies. 

Crab Apple Jelly. — ^This can be made exactly like 

apple jelly, only reducing the water considerably, say 

a gill to the pound of fruit, and using one and a 

quarter to one and a-half pounds of loaf sugar to 

the pint of jtdce. Or else: well wash the little 

apples (choosing the brightest coloured), but neither 

peel nor core them. Halve or quarter them and lay 

them in ihe pan with just enough water to cover 

them, and cook them to a pulp, when you turn them 

into the jelly bag and let them drain off all the 

night. In the morning weigh the juice, and to every 

pint of juice, allow one pound of sugar, and boil till 

perfectly clear and of a bright rosy red : try it by 

dropping a little on a plate and if it stiffens it is 

ready and must be at once lifted off, and poured into 

moulds or pots. A little lemon juice or a few drops 

of essence of lemon may be added just at the last. 

(This is an American recipe, and is also often used 

for ordinary apple jelly, but only the brightest, red- 

skinned ones must be chosen). 

Hips and Haws Jelly, — ^This can be made by 
esiacilj the same recipe as the rowan jelly. 

Grape Jelly. — ^This can be made precisely like every 
other jelly, i.e., the juice extracted, strained, weighed, 
and cooked with an equal weight of sugar, a par- 
ticularly fine jelly being made with either ripe purple 
or green Muscat grapes, these last being perfectly 
ripe. The unripe grapes obtained when the vines 
are thinned are also capable of producing jelly in th« 
came way, with the addition oi \\MiX* ^wA- vsasss^sga.

water to cover them, when first put into the pre- 
serving paai. Finish as for rowan jelly. But the 
best way of "using these unripe grapes is as a mar- 
malade. For this, put six pounds of the thinned out 
grapes into a saucepanful of boiling water, and as 
soon as they begin to swell, lift them off, add a little 
lemon juice and let them stand by the fire till quite 
green. Now turn them into an earthenware basin, 
and leave them till cool. When nearly cold rub them 
through a sieve and dry this puree over the fire. 
Then stir to it five pounds of cane sugar boiled to 
the crack, return it all to the fire, and cook till it will 
set nicely, when it is potted and covered down. 
Barberries, green apricots, and unripe windfalls can 
all be preserved in this way. A rougher and readier 
plan is to well wash the thinned grapes, then 
rinse them in fresh cold water, drain them 
lightly but do not dry them, and lay them in the 
preserving pan with an equal weight of sugar, and 
cook in the usual way, being very particular in the 
skimming, to remove all the seeds sent to the surface 
by the boiling. 

Windfall Jelly. — Wipe and stalk any small apples, 
windfalls, &c., but do not peel or core them, and cut 
out all bruised or decayed parts. Three parts fill a 
pot with them, with enough cold water to well cover 
them, and cook them to a pulp. Drain off as in 
preceding recipes till all the juice is extracted. 
Weigh this, and to each quart add lib. sugar, six or 
seven cloves, a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, a 
little stick cinnamon (tied up in muslin), and the 
''linly-pared rind and juice of half a lemon. Boil 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 49 

till thick, tlien remove tlie spice, and pot it. When 
cold it should be solid. (A most excellent and 
economic recipe.) 

Orange Marmcdade. — Pare off the rind of the 
oranges as thin as may be, cutting it as you do so 
into tiny strips. Quarter the oranges and lay them 
in the pan with as much water as will cover them ; 
keep them well squeezed with your hand till they 
become too hot to bear your hand in it ; then press 
the pulp through a clean hair sieve; add the 
chips to this, and for each pint of juice allow 
a pound of sugar. The juice and grated rind 
of a lemon must be allowed to every 41b. of 
oranges, and the juice of two sweet ones to 
every pound of bitter oranges. Cook till it jellies, 
and pot as usual. (This is a well known and most 
excellent Scotch recipe.) If you treat the oranges 
as above, only removing all the white pith, and 
leaving out the peel, and cook the juice with sugar 
in the usual way, adding the peel of two sweet 
oranges and the peel of one lemon to the juice, when 
boiling it with the sugar, it produces a most excellent 
jeUy. The rinds must be fished out of the jelly 
before potting it. Or : wash and wipe the oranges 
well to remove any dirt, but do not let them soak in 
the water. Now halve the fruit and then slice it as 
thinly as possible with a sharp knife, removing the 
pips and throwii^ them into a teacupful of warm 
water. Now weigh the sliced pulp, and for each 
pound add about one and a quarter pints of cold 
water (if the oranges are not very juicy they may 
need more water), and let it all soak together for

twenty-four to forty-eight hours ; at the end of thi» 
time boil it all together gently till the peel is soft 
enough to cut quite easily with the ha/ndle of a silver 
spoon. Now add to this the water in which the pips 
have soaked all this time (which will be quite 
glutinous), then measure the whole, reheat, and 
finish off as usual, with a pound of sugar to each 
pint of pulp. 

Tangerine Orange Marmalade. — This is made like 
any other marmalade, only adding a Seville and a 
sweet orange to every six tangerines, to bring out 
the flavour and to increase the juice. 

Lemon Marmalade. — Slice and remove the pips 
from twelve good lemons, and leave the sli'*ed fndt 
till next day (or for twelve hours), in six or seven 
quarts of water; then boil this all gently together 
for two hours, and again leave till next day. Now 
weigh it, and take for each pound of pulp an equal 
weight of sugar, and boil till quite clear and beginning 
to set, when it must be potted and tied down whilst 
hot. 

Moch Ginger, or Vegetable Marrow Jam, — ^Peel the 
marrow and cut it into inch dice ; make a syrup with 
21b. of brown (cane) sugar and five pints of water ; 
lay the marrow in this and let it steep for two days, 
when you strain it off. Have ready a second syrup 
made with a pound of loaf sugar, the jiiioe and 
thinly -pared rind of two lemons, a grain of cayenne, 
and loz. of well-bruised whole ginger, for each pound 
of marrow. Lay the strained marrow into this syrup, 
set it over a clear fire, and when it begins to dear 
add a liqueur-glassful of brandy for these qua^titieii 



JAMS, JELLIES, AND PASTES. 61 

and cook till traDsparent, when it is ready. Pot and 
tie down. 

Rhubarb Jam, — Peel and cut the rhubarb into 
one and a half inch lengths'; allow a pound of sugar 
to each pound of rhubarb, and lib. of dried figs cut 
up for every 51b. of fruit. Let the rhubarb stand, 
after cutting up, for twenty-four hours, covered with 
the sugar ; then boil the juice that will have run 
from it for twenty minutes, after which add the fruit 
and the figs, and boil together for twenty minutes 
longer. This is an old Scotch recipe, and varies in 
almost every household as some add ground ginger 
to it, others the fsrrated rind and juice of four lemons, 
or 2oz. of blanched and shred sweet almonds, &c. 

Orange Flower Conserve. — Mince the flowers, add 
to them the juice of a lemon, and then mix it with 
sugar (cooked), till on lifting it in the skimmer, and 
blowing through the latter the sugar flies off in great 
sparks ; let this all boil up a few times, then run it 
into moulds and dry in the stove. Take double the 
weight of sugar you have of blossoms. 

Rose Flower Conserve . — Rinse and pound some 
fine rose leaves when at their freshest and sweetest, 
taking 7oz. of rose leaves to the pound of sugar, and 
cook till the syrup from the sugar is all absorbed ; 
then moisten with a few drops of good rose water, 
pour it out on a wet board, and cut up into con- 
venient pieces when quite dry.

return them to the fire in the same water, and let 
them cook (but without boiling) till they yield to 
the application of your finger. Now strain them 
from the water, drain them, and then dust them with 
plenty of sugar ; let the sugary side dry thoroughly 
before turning them gently to sugar the other side in 
the same way. They are quickest dried at the mouth 
of a slack oven. They should eadi be placed in 
little paper cases, with paper in between to prevent 
their touching. Q-reengages are delicious this way. 

Orange and Lemon Feel to Candy, — Put the whole 
peels from the fruit into salt water for a few days, 
then lift them out and boil in fresh water till they 
are soft enough to be pierced with the head of a pin ; 
now drain and put them aside. Boil lib. of loaf 
sugar in half a pint of water for five minutes, then 
pour it on to the peel ; let this stand for a week, 
then drain off the syrup, bring it to the boil again, 
at once lay in the peel, and let it all boil gently to- 
gether till the peel looks clear ; it can now be turned 
into a wide-mouthed bottle or jar (being careful 
it is entirely covered with syrup), and covered down. 
It is extremely useful for all household purposes in 
this way; or if wanted candied, spread the peel 
out on a dish to cool, then powder it well with caster 
sugar, and leave it till dry, when it can be stored in 
airtight tins. 

Baw Fruit Preserve, — This is a Q-erman compete, 
and one as easy to make as it is useful. Into a 71b. 
jam jar put a pint of rum or brandy (or, indeed, any 
spirit to taste), and lib. of caster sugar, then lay ^

any frtdt at hand (no matter how many kinds), after 
stalking, stoning, and wiping itwhen necessary, adding 
in a pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, and 
stirring it all up well from the bottom with a clean 
wooden spoon each time fruit is added. A pint of 
spirit is ample for 71b. of fruit and sugar. The 
fruit may be added all through the summer, just as 
it comes to perfection. It must be kept carefuUy 
covered with a bladder. The more sorts of fruit the 
nicer this is, only remember to cut up the large fruit 
into convenient pieces, and stir it all well together each 
time it is touched. A very delicate form of this 
compote can also be made of strawberries only, using 
brandy and a dash of maraschino. This is very 
delicate, and must be kept tightly covered down. 
This fruit compote should be kept at least a month 
before use.

CHAPTEE V. 

LIQTJEUES, WINES, &o. 

With the renewed fancy for iced sweets and frozen 
dishes of various kinds whicl^ has arisen of late, 
there has also become prevalent a desire for liqueurs, 
and such like liquids, which of old always formed 
part of the still-room stores, but have, since the 
neglect of that department, dropped in a great 
measure out of general use. It is a great pity, for 
many were distinctly pleasant, and not a few 
as distinctly wholesome ; whilst they demand very 
little trouble to make, and the expense is considerably 
les& than if bought. The following, many of which 
are very old recipes, have been chosen as requiring 
no recondite utensils in their manufacture, and in- 
volving but little expense. But before starting on 
these recipes, it may be well to impress one or two 
points on the intending maker of such dainties. 

First, the fruit, used for liqueurs, cordials, Ac., 
fMist be in prime condition, and the rules conGeming 
fruit for preserving holds even more strongly witi 
regard for those used in liqueurs. Next, see that the 
sugar is first-rate, and pure cane sugar at that. 
This may be a little more expensive at the start, but 
IB amply made un by the superior quality of the 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &0. &5 

result, both as to flavour and keeping power. 
Inferior sugar necessarily involves clarification, if the 
liqueur is not to be cloudy (an unpardonable fault), 
which wastes both time and material considerably, 
and gives a good deal of unnecessary trouble. In 
the following recipes it is taken for granted that pure 
cane sugar of the best quality is used, therefore 
nothing is said as to clarification. If, however, there 
is any doubt on the matter, here is the way to clarify 
the syrup : Put six or seven pounds of loaf sugar in 
a large preserving pan with two quarts of cold spring 
water, and the whites and shells of two eggs ; let it 
come as slowly as possible to the boil, whisking it all 
the time with a delicately clean wire whisk, till the 
sugar is entirely dissolved ; as soon as it boils up 
and a thick scum forms at the top, stop whisking at 
once, let it rise up in the pan for a moment, then at 
once turn off the flame if using a stove or a gas ring, 
or lift it off if it is on the fire ; let it stand for a 
minute or two to settle, then pour it off through a 
jelly bag previously scalded in boiling water, and 
wrung dry, into a basin, when it should run perfectly 
clear. It is well on these occasions to have two 
basins, and then if the first filtering does not run 
clear, it can be returned very gently to the bag, and 
the rest allowed to run into the other basin. This 
syrup will be of a very pale straw colour ; pure cane 
sugar of first quality gives a much whiter syrup. 
Lastly, remember the spirit used mitst be of good 
quality. Liqueur made with inferior spirit is 
never satisfactory. It is to this fact that a great 
deal of the non-success of home-made liqueurs is 



56 PIOKLES AND PRESERVES. 

due, as it seems impossible to make the mistress 
(who thinks corked wines and the rinsings of the 
wine decanters the proper thing for culinary use), 
understand that coarse, common spirit of the 
cheapest kind can never be disguised. Therefore be 
careful as to the quality of all the materials used. 
Liqueur brandy, in spite of its name, or twenty-year- 
old whiskey is not required ; but sound, wholesome, 
and pure spirit undoubtedly is ; so unless your wine 
merchant is trustworthy, if economy is essential even 
m luxuries, prefer pure rectified spirits of wine to 
any distinctive form of alcohol. The French, who 
are famous for their liqueurs, mostly use pure 
alcohol for this purpose, or eau-de-vie hlanche, as 
they term it, which varies in strength from 50deg. 
to 60deg. ; failing this, ordinary, good o.p. spirit 
will answer excellently. All the following liqueurs 
are fit to drink very soon after they are finished, but 
every one gains immensely by being kept at least 
six to twelve months. Be careful in corking them to 
have new corks, and to press these well home with 
the mallet till level with the mouth of the bottle. 
Mind, when driving these home, to hold the bottle 
in one hand without letting it touch anything, or, 
when you use the maUet, you may smash the bottle. 
Angelica Liqueur, — Take one pound of angelica 
without any leaves, split and chop up these stalks small, 
and let them steep in four and a half pints of good spirit, 
weU covered, for six weeks. Then strain off, pressing 
the angelica well to extract every drop of juice; 
r irn this to the jar with a full half a pound of 
, ^oz. of cinnamon, a pinch of mace, two Or 



JJQTJEURS, WINES, &o. 67 

three cloves, and a few strips of lemon zest. Infuse 
for another six weeks, then strain through the jelly 
bag, bottle, and cork closely. Seal or not, as you 
choose. 

Anisette. — ^Melt two pounds of sugar candy in one 
pint of water, then mix into it one pint of good 
spirit (white) and twelve drops essence of anise seed. 
Shake every other day or so for a month. Improves 
with age. Or : 

Put into a jar a quart of spirit, the very thinly- 
pared rind or zest of twenty lemons, quarter of a 
pound of anise seed, and a bit of stick cinnamon ; cork 
down closely and infuse for six weeks. Now break 
up two pounds of cane loaf sugar and dip each piece 
into water till just on the point of melting ; strain 
off the liqueur in the jar, add this sugar to it, re-cork 
the jar (which must have been emptied out), and 
after shaking it well together let it stand a fortnight 
longer, then filter, and bottle off as before. 

Barberry Liqueur, — Bruise seven pounds of bar- 
berries in a marble mortar, then turn this pulp into 
a jar with seven pounds of best cane loaf sugar, 
pounded and sifted, cover with a gallon of spirit and 
let it all staud for ten days, well covered, then strain 
off through a clean hair sieve, let the juice stand for 
a little to settle, then filter it gently, bottle and cork. 

Bay Rwm. — Infuse two pounds of fresh bay leaves 
in a gallon of white rum for a month, keeping it 
tightly corked, and shaking the jar every few days or 
80 to shake up the leaves, then filter off and bottle. 

Blachberry Cordial, — Pick the blackberries over 
carefully, only taking the finest and ripest, then put

them into a jar and braise tliem a little, and to each 
quart of fruit allow a pint of whiskey; let these 
stand together for twelve hours, then stir together 
and strain through a jelly bag. Measure the liqueur, 
and to each quart allow 4oz. sugar, loz. well bruised 
ginger, and the rind of half a lemon thinly pared. 
Let it stand for ten or twelve days, then strain and 
bottle, sealing the corks. A variety of this is made 
by using brandy, and flavouring it when strained 
with ^oz. of cinnamon and one dram of cloves 
previously crushed and infused for a fortnight in a 
short half a pint of brandy. This requires standing 
a little longer than the first recipe. 
Brandy, Apricot — See Peach Brandy. 

Cherry, — Stalk and stone the cherries, 

using half Morellas, and half the black juicy fruit ; 
prick them lightly with a needle, and half fill some 
wide-mouthed bottles with the fruit, allowing six or 
eight cherry kernels, or three or four bitter almonds 
to each bottle, together with about loz. finely crushed 
sugar candy, and fiU up with brandy. Let it stand 
for two months, then strain, re-bottle, and cork down 
tightly. (If preferred, leave the cherries in a little 
longer.) These same cherries make a delicious 
bonbon if dipped in royal icing and allowed to set. 
If, however, the cherries are to be used for this 
purpose, leave about half an inch of stalk on each. 

Ginger, — Put into a wide- mouthed quart 

bottle loz. slightly bruised old green Jamaica ginger 
and loz. crushed sugar candy, and fill up with good 
brandy. Let it stand for a month before straining 
**, Improves by keeping.

Brandy, Orange. — Slice three Seville oranges into 
a jar, pour a bottle of brandy on them and let them 
stand for six weeks, closely covered; then strain, 
bottle, and cork down closely. (Some thrifty house- 
wives put the oranges in whole and let them stand 
two months ; then, when the liqueur is strained off, 
the oranges are candied and used for dessert. But 
this liqueur is not so good.) Or : Pare the rind very 
thinly from eight Seville oranges and eight lemons, 
put them into a jai with a gallon of good brandy ; 
make a syrup with eight pounds of loaf sugar and 
three or four pints of water, and pour this boiling on 
to the peel, &c. Let it all stand forty-eight hours, 
stirring it constantly, then strain and bottle off into 
pint bottles. (This is an old family recipe.) 

Peach. — Peel and slice six fairly ripe 

peaxjhes over a basin, so as to lose none of the juice, 
then add the kernels, lightly bruised, and 3oz. to 4oz. 
crushed sugar candy, pouring over it all lastly a 
bottle of good brandy, and let it stand closely covered 
for six weeks. Now strain and bottle, corking down 
closely. Some people prefer adding the sugar in a 
clear syrup when the liqueur has been strained, as 
then they can regulate the sweetening to taste. 
(N.B. — ^This remark applies to almost every kind of 
home-made liqueur.) Or : 

Peel and halve six good ripe and large peaches, 
and arrange them in layers, with the hollow upper- 
most in a large glass jar, placing a blanched kernel 
in every second half peach ; strew caster sugar over 
each layer, covering the top layer rather more 
thickly, and using about ^Ib. in aU. "La^ \5kss^ ^wm

till next day, then cover with one and a half pints of 
pale brandy previously mixed with half a pint of 
syrup. Let it now stand for a month, then add a 
pint of spirit, and filter off as required. Apricots 
and the large " golden drop " plum are delicious in 
this way. 

Brandy, Lemon, — ^Pare off very thinly the rinds 
of six large fresh lemons, and steep these for six 
weeks in a pint of good brandy. Now strain it off, 
and add to it the strained juice of four lemons, a 
pint of good clear syrup, and, if liked, just enough 
saffron to colour it lightly. 

Oreme d^Ahsinthe. — Put 3oz. of young green 
wormwood (absinthe) or, better still, the young 
flower shoots as they are about to open, into four or 
five quarts of good spirit, with three cloves and ^oz. 
of stick cinnamon. Let it infuse for eight or nine 
days, then strain ; add to it one pint of plain syrup, 
filter, bottle, and cork securely. Mind nothing but 
silver (in the way of metal) touches this liqueur. 
Add a drop or two of liquid green colouring if not 
sufl&ciently coloured, but be careful with this. 

De Menthe. — ^Lay from twelve to fifteen 

freshly gathered sprays of young mint in a jar, 
strain on to them the juice of two lemons, and then 
pour a pint of good brandy on it all, cover down 
closely and let it infuse for seven to fourteen days, 
according to the strength of flavour desired; 
then strain, sweeten witih syrup to taste, bottle, 
nnd cork closely. 

cP Oranges. — Slice twelve or thirteen 

) and pour on to them three quarts of best 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &o. 61 

rectified spirit and a pint of orange flower water; 
coyer the jar containing all tliis very closely and let 
it stand for ten days. Now add to it 51b. of clarified 
sugar syrup, a quart of water, and Joz. of tincture of 
saffron. Close the jar again closely, let it stand a 
fortnight longer, then strain it off through a jelly 
bag, and when it has settled pour it carefully off the 
lees, and bottle and seal it. (The lees of this liqueur 
are excellent for flavouring puddings, &c.) 

Casais, — Pick over and crush 81b. of fine ripe 
black currants and put them in a jar with four and 
a half quarts ,of good gin, |lb. of raspberries, two 
doves, a bit of cinnamon, and sugar or crushed 
sugar candy to taste. Let it stand for six weeks, 
then strain, bottle, and keep for at least three 
months. 

CUron Cordial, — ^Peel off the rinds of sufficient 
citrons to give fib., and put this into a gallon of any 
good spirit, with ^Ib. of very thinly pared orange 
rind, and two bruised nutmegs ; let it stand for ten 
days, keeping it in a warm place, then add to it 
three pints of clarified syrup, mix well, and bottle 
off. 

Goffee Liquettr (Huile au Cafe). — Roast 126 coffee 
beans to a delicate rich brown, but without a trace 
of burning, make a syrup with lib. of good Demerara 
sugar (30 degrees), put the coffee into this, and let 
it boil up sharply two or three times with hardly 
any interval, then pour it all, boiling, on to one and 
a half pints of spirit ; let it infuse, closely corked,, 
berries and all, for a month, then filter, bottle, andl 
seal closely. 



62 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Damson Cordial. — ^Prick some sound, ripe damsons 
all over with a needle, then pack them into wide 
mouthed bottles, in alternate layers of fruit and 
caster sugar ; when the bottle is half full put in a 
lemon and an orange sliced or chopped (remove the 
pips), six or eight cloves, a small bit of cinnamon, 
Joz. whole ginger, and a vaniUa bean. Now fill up 
the bottle with fruit and sugar as before, and pour 
on to it a bottleful of the best gin, cork tightly, and 
keep in a dark place for six months. 

Eucalyptus Liqueur. — Put into a jar lib. of dried 
eucalyptus leaves, l^z. juniper berries, 2oz. orange- 
flowers, and a quart of spirit ; close it down tightly, 
and infuse for fourteen days, shaking it daily for a 
week ; then strain, mix with a pint of clear syrup, 
filter, and bottle off. 

Gin, Cherry, — Stalk lib. of cherries, and scald 
(but do not boil) them in a quart of syrup, then lay 
them in wide-mouthed bottles, and pour on to them 
a quart of good unsweetened gin, and two quarts of 
syrup, including that in which they were scalded, 
and a bottle of essence of cherries ; cork down closely. 
It is ready for use almost at once, but improves by 
keeping. Filter as wanted. 

; Damson. — Choose ripe, sound fruit, and 

prick them in several places with a darning needle. 
Have ready, clean, dry, and wide-mouthed bottles, 
and drop in the damsons, about half filling them, 
and shaking in, as you do so, from lioz. to 2oz. of 
crushed sugar-candy, and the kernels of five or six 
damsons, or as many bitter almonds (shred), and fill 
up with good unsweetened gin; cork the bottles 



LIQUEURS, WINES, Ac. 63 

tightly, and store in a dry place for two or three 
months, shaking the bottles every few days ; then 
strain off, bottle, and cork down closely. Improves 
by keeping. 

Oin, Sloe, — ^This is made in precisely the same 
way as damson gin, and both admit of some 
slight variations, such as the addition of a clove or 
two, one or two bitter almonds, a strip of finely 
peeled lemon rind to each bottle, or the use of 
syrup instead of the sugar -candy, the syrup being 
made either from sugar or sugar-candy. It is weU 
to remember that bullaces, cherries, currants of all 
ooloiu-s (only adding a few currant leaves), rasp- 
berries, blackberries, sloes, &c., can all be made into 
liqueur in this way, the sloes being especially good. 
Apricots and greengages are also good this way, but 
still better to most tastes if good brandy or white 
rum be substituted for the gin. Pineapple is also 
excellent with this treatment. 

Orange, — Pare very thinly the rind of 

twelve oranges, and infuse them for a month in a 
gallon of best unsweetened gin, in a tightly closed 
jar ; now strain off the liquid, add to it ^Ib. of 
powdered sugar-candy, and leave for a week or ten 
days till it is thoroughly dissolved, then filter, &c. 

Ginger Cordial, — There are several makes of this. 
I. Put into a jar a quart of any kind of spirit 
(originally the white eau-de-vie was used for this), 
with the rind and strained juice of two lemons, the juice 
of two oranges, and 2oz. of whole ginger crushed pretty 
fine. Now measure lib. of loaf sugar broken up into 
lumps, dip each of these quickly into cold, spring 



64 PIOKLES AND PRESERYES. 

water, and throw each (when well wetted) into a 
brass skillet ; then boil it all till it clears to a pale 
straw colour, and pour it over the other ingredients. 
Let it all stand for twenty-four hours, stirring it 
frequently, then bottle off for use. 11. Strip the 
stalks from lib. of white currants, bruise them 
gently in a bowl, then for each lib. of currants add 
a quart of good whisky and the thinly pared rind 
of a lemon ; let it stand for twenty-four hours, and 
strain off. Then to this add lib. of crushed loaf 
sugar and Joz. of well-crushed whole ginger. Let 
this steep again, well covered down for a few days 
(the length of steeping depends on the strength 
you wish the ginger flavour to have), then filter, and 
bottle off. After making this cordial you can 
produce excellent essence of ginger by putting the 
ginger used in making the liqueur into a bottle, and 
covering it well with whisky, allowing it to steep 
for a month or so. Of course, freshly pounded root 
ginger makes the essence quicker, but the other is 
very satisfactory. 

Ooldwaseer (Dantzig), — To a quart of pure white 
spirit add twelve drops of essence of anise seed, six of 
oil of cinnamon, three of oil of roses, and eight of 
oil of citron; then mix it with a quart of clear syrup, 
filter it, and, when bottling, break into it tiny pieces 
of gold leaf. 

Kimm6l. — Infuse loz! of carraway seeds in a 
quart of unsweetened gin, with ^oz. to Joz. of 
crushed sugar candy, for two or three months, then 
strain off and bottle. Improves by keeping. 

Carraway Brandy, a favourite German liquemr, 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. 65 

is made in the same way, by infusing loz. of the 
seeds in a bottle of good brandy for two or three 
months, then strain ; mix with a syrup made of 
fib. of loaf sugar, boiled to a syrup with a very 
little water. Both these liqueurs are looked on as 
excellent stomachics. 

Another way of making this liqueur is by 
mixing together well seventy drops of oil of carra- 
ways and from three-quarters to a quart of clear 
syrup ; shake it well together, then filter and bottle. 

^* Madame Anne's Inqneur.** — ^Put into a jar a 
gallon of brandy or extra good whisky, with 41b. of 
white currants, 41b. loaf sugar, loz. of ground 
cinnamon, loz. of cloves, and loz. ground bitter 
almonds; shake these all well together, and let it 
stand closely covered for three or four weeks, shaking 
the jar two or three times a day all the time. 
Strain it off through very fine muslin, let it stand 
to settle, then bottle, pouring it off very carefully. 
A secret well known to old liqueur makers was the 
fragrance imparted to most liqueurs by the use of 
flowers, which were left shut up in the casks or jars 
to be used for three days to a week, the container 
being closely corked down. The liqueur was then 
poured in the very instant the flowers were removed. 
A magnolia flower tied to a string and hung in this 
way will give a most delicious though indescribable 
bouquet to a large jar. 

Mandarine, — ^Remove every scrap of white pith 
from the rind of some Tangerine or Mandarine 
oranges, and steep this peel for one to two 
months in alcohol, at 85deg., allowing 4oz. of

three pints of spirit. When it has stood well, bottle 
o£E, adding to it three pints of clear syrup. A few 
drops of treble distilled orange flower water are an 
addition to this. 

Maraschino, — Stone seven pounds of Morella 
cherries saving all the juice, and adding to them 
the kernels of their stones, then crush it all in a 
marble mortar, and lay this pulp into a large jar 
with about three pounds of wild cherry leaves, or 
failing these the same quantity of peach leaves, a 
quarter of a pound of red rose leaves, loz. fresh 
orange blossoms, and loz. whit<e jessamine flowers 
(these leaves and flowers should all be first lightly 
bruised in the mortar), and six pounds best loaf 
sugar, pour over it all five quarts of pure white 
spirit and let it infuse for a month, then filter and 
bottle off. 

Pwncht Milk, — ^Pare very thinly the rinds of twelve 
lemons and two Seville oranges, and put them into a 
jar, straining their juice on to them ; now add a 
nutmeg grated, two and a half pounds of broken up 
loaf sugar, a bottle of brandy, and one and a half of 
rum, then cover closely, and let it stand for forty- 
eight hours. Now add to it five pints of water, and 
a quart of boiling milk. Let it all stand for an hour 
or so, then strain ofE through a double jelly bag, 
and bottle, sealing down closely. It takes about 
treble this quantity of material to make two dozen 
bottles of this punch, which keeps well. 

Noyeau, — Infuse 2oz. sweet and loz. bitter almonds 
(preinoualj crushed in a marble mortar), with about 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. 67 

3oz. loaf sugar, in a quart of gin for a fortnight, then 
strain through muslin and blotting paper, and bottle 
off. Some persons add peach or apricot kernels to 
the almonds, and two or three peachleaves to the 
quart of spirit ; whilst others add finely pared lemon 
rind in the proportion of one and a half lemons to 
the quart. 

Batafia, Apricot — Blanch and shred three-quarters 
of a pound of apricot kernels, and infuse these for 
fifteen days in fiye quarts of brandy, shaking the 
bottle every now and then ; now drain off the kernels 
on a sieve, returning the droppings to the rest ; then 
mix this liqueur with a syrup made with four pounds 
of sugar and two and a half pints of water, filter 
and bottle off. 

Fruit — ^Put into a crock one gallon of 

brandy, two quarts of fruit juice, two pounds of 
sugar, two or three cloves, joz. cinnamon, and a bit 
of lemon peel ; let this stand for a month, then filter 
and bottle off. All kinds of soft fruit, such as 
blackberries, currants, mulberries, Ac., can be used 
thus. 

Orange. — ^Put the finely pared rind of 

twelve or fourteen oranges into a gallon of brandy, 
and strain the juice of the oranges on to two pounds 
of sugar ; put the orange pips into a cupful of warm 
water, and let them steep. When the sugar is melted 
add it and the juice to the brandy, and lastly the 
wuter in which the pips were steeped. (These should 
steep till the water becomes slightly gelatinous). Let 
this all stand a month, then filter and bottle off. 

Oranqe Flower. — Inf\ii&^ \7w<i \»!^ <3SixssiRA

of fresh orange blossoms for four days in three and 
a half, pints of pure spirit, or brandy ; then strain, 
mix with a clear syrup made by boiling l^lb. of best 
loaf sugar in one and a half pints of water, filter and 
bottle off. Jessamine flowers also make a delicious 
ratafia, if 4oz. are infused in three pints of white 
spirit for four days, then strained, mixed with a pint 
of syrup (thirty degrees) filtered and bottled off. 

Batafia, Quince, — Grate some very ripe quinces 
to the core, and strew on it about loz, of caster 
sugar to the pound of fruit, and let it stand twenty- 
four hours. Now wring it well to extract every drop 
of liquid, and mix it with an equal quantity of brandy, 
adding 2oz. of loaf sugar to every pint of the mixture, 
and either a piece of stick cinnamon or Jib. of 
angelica for every pound of quince. Let it stand for 
a little, then filter and bottle ofE. Another way is to 
steep the grated quince in the brandy or spirit, 
allowing a pound of quince, grated, to nearly a gallon 
of spirit, sweetening it when strained with about 
the same amount of clear syrup, (This recipe is a 
French one, and the liquid is measured by litres,) 

Baspail Liqueur, — Take a nutmeg, and of cloves, 
myrrh, and succotrin aloes each 2 grammes, 25 centi- 
grammes of saffron, 4oz. calamus aromaticus, and 
8 grammes of vanilla; steep this in the sun for 
fifteen days, shaking the bottle daily, in a quart of 
brandy, then dissolve in it lib. of loaf sugar ; when 
this is thoroughly melted, filter it off and keep it 
closely stoppered, in a dark cupboard. I have given 
the French quantities as this is a much praised 
'French liqueur. 



LIQUEURS, WINES, Ac. 69 

Strawberry Liqueur, — Clioose very ripe red straw- 
berries, and three x>^rts lill some wide-moutlied 
bottles with these (do not pack too closely), then add 
as much caster sugar as will fill up the bottle, and a 
strip or two of very finely pared lemon rind, fill up 
with brandy, and let it steep for a month. Alpine 
strawberries are best for this. 

Bowan Whiskey, — Choose ripe and red mountain 
ash berries, prick them a Httle, and put them into a 
large jar with alternate layers of crushed sugar 
candy, using equal weight of candy and fruit, and 
pour on to it some good whiskey, in the proportion 
of a gallon for every 71b. of fruit. (This is a 
Russian recipe, in which vodki is used, but the giver 
of it said whiskey was the nearest available spirit. 
It certainly makes a good liqueur.) It should stand 
for a fortnight at least, before straining and 
filtering. 

Juniper berries make a very good liqueur also, 
though they are made in less heroic quantities ; ^Ib. 
of berries being infused for a fortnight in two 
quarts of brandy with 6oz. of loaf sugar, closely 
stoppered down, then strained off, filtered, bottled, 
and corked closely. 

Vanderhum (Old Dutch recipe). — ^For every quart 
of good brandy allow a good dessertspoonful of 
bruised (not ground) cinnamon, four or five cloves, 
two tablespoonfuls of finely pared Tangerine orange 
rind (nartje-rind) and a grate of nutmeg. Mix all

syrup (putting Jib. of sugar to the quart of brandy) ; 
add a pint of this syrup and a wineglassf ul of best 
rum to each quart of brandy, &c,, and let it all 
stand together for three weeks; then strain ofE 
carefully, filtering it if necessary, and bottle. The 
brandy and rum used for this must be of really good 
quality, especially the rum, as this mellows the 
whole. Some people use sugar-candy instead of the 
sugar, but this is a matter of taste. At the Cape, 
where this liqueur is made in large quantities, it is 
put into a cask after the syrup is added, a stiffly- 
whisked white of egg being laid in lightly at the top 
for each gallon of liqueur, to clear it, and at the end 
of three weeks it is bottled off. 

Vanilla Liqueur (Creme de vanille). — Dissolve 
21b. lOoz. of best loaf sugar broken up small in 
three pints of filtered water (this liqueur is so 
delicate it is well worth using distilled water for it) ; 
when this has boiled up once, pour it boiling on to 
three drachms of stick vanilla cut in pieces, and half 
a grain of amber. When this is quite cold add to it 
three pints of good brandy, cover down closely, and 
let it infuse for six days ; then colour with a little 
prepared cochineal, filter, bottle, cork tightly, and 
seal. 

Vespetro, — ^Put into a jar loz. each of angelica 
seeds, anise seed, coriander seed, carraway seed, and 
fennel seed; put with it 31b. crushed sugar- candy, 
and one gallon of brandy, and infuse closely covered 
for six week^, then filter and bottle off. 

Walnut Liqueur, — Gather the nuts in June or July 
n the fiheils are still soft), then put into a lar^e 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &o. 7i 

wide-mouthed bottle about thirty green walnuts, 
thirty cloyes, a pinch of vanilla, or cinnamon, and 
one and a half pints of spirit ; cork down closely and 
stand the bottle in the sun for fiye or six weeks, 
shaking it daily, to soak the fruit thoroughly. Now 
strain well and make a syrup with the liquor strained 
from the nuts, Iflb. loaf sugar, a full half pint of 
water, and about a gill more spirit, or brandy. Let 
this stand till nearly cold, then filter, bottle, cork, 
and seal, and keep for at least six months in an even 
temperature. It is an improvement to either cut up 
or prick the nuts before adding them to the brandy, 
and, if preferred, crushed sugar-candy can be used 
instead of sugar. In Germany Nu88 Schnappt 
(Walnut gin) is made in exactly the same way, only 
using H ollands for the spirit, and omitting the sugar. 
This liqueur which should be of a faint green, ii 
considered a great stomachic in Germany. 

It may be worth reminding thrifty housewives, 
that these liqueurs are well worth making for kitchen 
purposes, as they save the more expensive bought 
liqueurs and are very easily prepared, as being for 
use in flavouring sweet dishes there need be no syrup 
added; the method usually consists of adding a 
certain proportion of any sort of essence to the spirit, 
in about the proportion of ten to fifteen drops of any 
concentrated essence to taste, to one and a half pints 
of spirit, and infusing for a fortnight before bottling 
it off. (Remember the proportion must vary slightly 
with the strength and freshness of the essence 
used.)

followed, omitting the syrup. A very useful 
specimen of this class is 

Spirit of Curdqoa, — For this dry the thinly pared 
rind of four lemons, four sweet and four Seville 
oranges in the oven, then infuse them for a month 
in three pints of brandy or any spirit to taste, with a 
piece of stick cinnamon and a tiny blade of mace. 
Keep this closely covered and at the end of the time 
filter and bottle ofE in little bottles. Or 

Spirit of Bosolio, — ^Infuse for a fortnight fifty 
grammes of fresh orange blossom petals, five 
grammes of cinnamon, two of mace, two of cloves, 
ten grammes of rose and jessamine petals, half the 
thinly pared rind of one citron and one lemon, and 
a morsel of vanilla in a full quart of spirit, then 
filter and bottle. The addition of sufiicieat cold, 
clear syrup to taste will convert any of these so- 
called " spirits " into very nice liqueurs. 



CHAPTER VI. 

LIQUEUES, WINES, &a 
((Continued) . 

FoBMEBLY home-made wines were in great request, 
and every kind of fruit and, indeed, vegetable, was 
utilised for this purpose. The fashion has, however, 
somewhat died out, though here and there house- 
wives still ask for recipes for cowslip, blackberry, 
and other wines of this kind, and recipes for these 
have frequently appeared in the columns of the 
Queen. Indeed, many of these are very useful in the 
kitchen. 

Home-made Red Wine. — Take of rhubarb (autumn), 
141b. ; elderberries, one gallon ; bilberries, one gal- 
lon. Cut the rhubarb into inch pieces, pound it 
well with a wooden mallet, and put it in a very clean 
mash tub. Then add the elderberries, and, lastly, 
the bilberries, crushing both of these well in a bowl 
before adding them, being careful that each berry is 
crushed. Now, for this quantity of fruit, pour to it 
four and a half gallons of freshly boiled and boiling 
water, cover with a blanket or folded cloth, to keep 
out the dust, and let it stand four or five days, by 
which time it will have formed a thick crust on the 
top. (It will do this sooner if the weather is close.) 
Now draw off the liquor very careivjAI^ \s^ \s\asiX5s. ^^ 



74 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

a little wooden tap, which should have been fixed 
close to the bottom of the tub, being very particular 
not to break the crust ; if there is no tap, this crust 
must be skimmed ofE, but this is very troublesome, 
as every scrap must be removed, or it will hopelessly 
cloud the wine. Now for each gallon of liquid allow 
81b. of (cane) brown sugar, mix it well in, and pour 
the result into a cask, keeping back a gallon of tht* 
liquid to add later on. It will take seven to eight 
days to finish the fermentation, and this surplus 
liquor may be added in gradually during this process. 
Meanwhile, soak 2oz. of gelatine in a pint of the 
liquid, and then dissolve it over the fire, and poui- 
this solution to the wine when the fermentation 
stops ; then bimg it down closely, and let it stand 
for five or six months. When ready add to it a 
quart of elderflower water and a gill of mock or 
real kirschwasser. 

Apple Wine, — Put into a pan four quarts of apples, 
crush lightly, and pour on to it a gallon of boiling 
water. Cover, and let it stand a fortnight, then 
strain, and to each pound of juice allow lib. of loaf 
sugar slightly moistened in hot water. When this is 
dissolved, pour the liquid into crocks, covered with a 
sheet of i>aper or a cloth to keep out the dust, but do 
not cork down, Let this stand until it has worked, 
i. e, until it is all covered with a thick scum ; remove 
this with a quill or by the tap, and if no more 
scum rises by the next day, bottle, cork, and seal. 
It improves greatly by keeping. 

^irch Wine, — ^To each gallon of the birch-tree sap 
put 4Ib. loaf sugar, and the thinly pared riud 



LIQUEimS, WINES, Ac. 75 

of a lemon. Boil and skim this well, and when cool 
add a toast with fresh yeast ; let it ferment for four 
or 'five days, then cork it down closely, and in four 
weeks rack it off and bottle. 

Home-made Champagne, — ^Bruise well with a 
wooden mallet 71b. green gooseberries and 141b. of 
good rhubarb, cut into inch lengths ; now put it into 
a large tub with a wooden tap fitted near the bottom, 
pour five gallons of freshly boiled and boiling water 
upon it, and let it stand for five days. When a thick 
crust forms on the surface draw off as in the previous 
recipe, then mix into it 3^1b. of sugar to each gallon 
of liquid, mix it well, and put it into a very clean 
cask, add a quart of elderflower water, and about 
2|oz. of gelatine, dissolved as before in a pint of the 
wine, heated ; draw it off in twenty-four hours, then 
bottle in champagne bottles, wiring it down. Keep 
in an even moderate temperature. Improves by 
keeping. 

Blackberry Wine, — Choose ripe full fruit, gathered 
on a dry day, and mash it well ; now for every pint 
of fruit pour on to it a pint of freshly-boiled and 
boiling water, stir it well together, and let it stand 
till a crust forms on the surface, which it will do in 
about four or five days. Now draw it off gently 
without disturbing the crust, add a pound of sugar 
to each gallon of liquid, pour it into a cask and let it 
work for twelve days; then add to it a stick of 
cinnamon, and, if liked, a gill of gin, or brandy, for 
each gallon of wine ; bung down, and store for ten 
or twelve months. 

Cowslip Wine, — ^Boil tog^WiSt ra. ^i&}\^wa. ^\^^^^sx^ 



76 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

the whites of four eggs, 121b. rouglilj crushed 
loaf sugar, and the juice of five or six lemons, for 
half an hour, keeping it well skimmed. Now put 
into a delicately clean tub two pecks of cowslip 
flowers freed ^om the stalks, together with the 
thinly-pared rind of three or four lemons (if small), 
and pour the boiling syrup on it; keep it well stirred 
with a clean stick, and whfen it is just lukewarm add 
a slice of bread carefully toasted (not burnt) on 
both sides, and spread with fresh yeast, Let this 
all stand in a cool place for three or four days, then 
strain it all off, pressing the flowers well to extract 
all the juice, and pour it into a clean cask (which 
should have been washed out with a little decent 
spirit); press the bung in lightly for a few days till 
it stops working, then bung down closely and let it 
stand for three months before bottling. A gill of 
spirit to the gallon of wine should be added, if it is 
to be kept for some time. It must be remembered 
that the merit of this wine (which, if properly made, 
is considerable), depends almost entirely on the care 
bestowed on it, and the perfect cleanliness of every 
utensil used. 

Coltsfoot Wine, formerly highly prized for its 
medicinal qualities, is made in the same way, only 
using from one to one and a half pecks of flowers 
instead of two, with the addition of 31b. of stoned 
and halved raisins. 

Currant Wine. — ^Put into a perfectly clean, dry 
tub, six quarts of currant juice, and pour on it 121b. 
of sugar previously dissolved in six quarts of boiling 
water, and let it stand to ferment, which it will do 



LIQUEURS, WINES, Ac* 77 

for itself withont any help. Keep back a little of 
the liquid to add to Uie wine when it has femionted, 
and has been drawn ofL A quart of brandy should 
be added to the cask for this quantity of wine, just 
as jou dose the cask, and it will then keep for 
years. This wine is well worth the making, and can 
be made with either black or red currants, the 
former being specially luscious. 

DcunBon Wine. — Boil together equal quantities of 
sngar and water, then add the stalked fruit, and 
boil it together till it is all in a mash, allowing 61b. 
of fruit to the gallon of syrup; now strain it off 
into a dean tub, pressing it to get out all the juice, 
and let it ferment as before ; then draw it off, put it 
into a cask with the gelatine (as in Red Wino), and 
a quart of brandy for every four gallons. Do not 
bottle for a year, and then strain through flannel 
into the bottles, cork down well and store for 
another year before drinking. 

Dandelion Wine, — Put into a tub four quarts of 
the yellow petals of the dandelion, and pour on to it 
a gallon of water that has been boiled and then 
allowed to cool till only just warm ; stir it well 
together, then cover with a doubled blanket and let 
it stand for three days, stirring it every now and 
then. Now strain off the flowers, boil the liquid for 
half an hour with the thinly pared rinds of one 
lemon and- one orange, with a little piece of bruised 
ginger, and 3|lb. of sugar to each gallon. Add the 
pxQp of the lemons, sliced, to the boiling liquid, and 
when cool ferment with a slice of toast spread with 
yeast. Let it stand for two or three days, then draw 



78 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

off as before into a cask; let it stand for two 
months, and then bottle. (This wine is said to be 
excellent for liver complaints.) 

Elderberry Wine, — On to a gallon of elderberries 
pour a gallon of boiling water and let it stand for 
twelve hours ; then strain it off, and boil the liquor 
with 3^1b. of loaf sugar ; when boiling, clarify with 
the whites of three or four eggs, strain it through a 
jelly bag, and add to it Joz. of ground ginger for 
every gallon of wine, and let it boil together for a 
little more ; then pour it into the tub and when cool 
put in the toast spread with yeast as before. Let it 
ferment for a few days, then draw it off carefully 
and put into a cask previously rinsed out with 
brandy. If to be kept, add half a pint of brandy to 
<each gallon. Let it stand for six months, then 
bottle off. 

Elderflower Wine, — Whisk the whites of six eggs 
to a froth, and put them with six gallons of water 
and 161b. of loaf sugar ; boil well, skimming care- 
fully, then add to the boiling liquid 81b. of best 
raisins, stoned and chopped, and a quarter-peck of 
elderflower s, and allow these to infuse — do not boil 
them — till quite cool, when you put in a quarter of a 
pint of yeast to it, stirring it well up. Let it stand 
<30vered till the next day, when you add in the juice 
and thinly pared rind of four lemons, and let it 
ferment in iiie tub for three days, then draw off and 
'Cask as before. 

Ginger Wine. — For every ten gallons of water take 
231b. of loaf sugar and lib. of bruised ginger. Boil it 
^JJ toj^rether for half-an-hour, stirring and skimming

ife eonstaatly ; the last, ten minutefl it is 1)oiling, put 
in the juioe of thirty-six large lemons, with half the

jeaat as before. When the fermentation ceases, 
ddm off the cnist very cirefuUy, and put the liquor 
into the cask with the ginger, lemon peel, and Joz. 
of isinglass, and also a quart of brandy. When it 
has ceased hissing, stop the cask down tightly, and 
lettfe it for three weeks, then bottle off. If the cask 
holds ten gaUons, it is best to make eleven gallons of 
the wine, and keep filling up the cask till it has done 
hissing. Be sure to keep it closely stopped. From 
experience I should recommend peeling the lemons 
feiy thinly in preference to mincing them. BcHt 
made about ApriL It is marvellously effervescent. 

Oooteberry Wine (WhiteJ. — To every quart of ripe 
white gooseberries take one and a half quarts of 
water and 12oz. of sugar, crushed and dissolved; 
«tir this all together in the tub, cover it over with a 
blanket (unless you do this it shickens the fermenta- 
tion), and let it all stand for three days, stirring it 
occasioDally ; then strain it off into a c^ask, filling

purpose, tiU it ceases hissing ; now for every gallon 
of wine add half a pint each of brandy and sherry, 
and bung it up as tightly as possible. Let it sttind

Tedpe of Meg Dod's, and produces a really excel- 
lent liquor. It also answers for various fruits,

fancy, from the days when grape vines grew on 
every south-facing cottage. Take the fruit before 
it is thoroughly ripe, and put it (stalks and all) 
into the tub; crush it till every berry is broken, 
then for each pound of fruit add a quart of cold 
water; cover with a blanket, and let it stand for 
three days, stirring it pretty frequently, and then 
strain off, adding three full pounds of loaf sugar to 
every gallon of the wine. As soon as this is dissolved, 
pour it all into a cask, which should be full (keep back 
two or three quarts to fill up with), and add a little 
more as the fermentation subsides. In about ten 
days it will have stopped hissing, then pour in 
about a quarter of a pint of brandy to each gallon, 
and ^oz. of best leaf gelatine, dissolved in a little of 
the wine, for every five gallons. Bung up and store 
in a cool place. Be very careful not to add thi> 
brandy and gelatine till the cask has quite done hissing, 
and then fasten up very securely. Leave it till 
the next year, and bottle when the vines are in 
bloom, corking, and wiring down firmly. 

Orape Wine (OnfermentedJ, — Pick free from stalk 
and stem 101b. of grapes, put them into a preserving 
pan with a little water, let them cook till the pulp and 
stones separate, then press and strain them through a 
jelly bag ; return the juice to the pan, adding 31b. 
of wh^te sugar; let the sugar melt slowly, then 
bring the mixture to boiling point ; bottle whilst hot 
and seal it. This quantity of grapes ought to make 
a gallon of wine. 

Orange Wine, — Take ten Seville oranges and 31b. 
of sufi^ for every gallon. Strain into a delicately 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &o. 81 

clean cask the juice of the fruit and the sugar ; and 
put the squeezed pulp into a basin, and pour on tc 
it two quarts of water, let it stand for twenty -four 
hours, then strain off to the rest in the tub. Now 
add the thinly pared rinds of half the oranges used, 
to the pulp, pour another two quarts on this, again 
let it stand for twenty-four hours, and strain this 
also into the cask. Eepeat this steeping with the 
twenty-four hours interval until the cask is full, 
stirring it all well up daily. Let it all stand for 
three days, then bung it down closely, and leave it 
for nine months ; then bottle off, but do not 
drink it till three months later. Of course these 
quantities may be increased d discretion, &nd accord- 
ing to the size of the cask, but always keep to these 
proportions. Or : 

Dissolve 81b. of loaf sugar and 41b. of honey in 
six gallons of water, add the lightly' whisked whites 
of ten or twelve eggs, and bring the whole to the 
boil gently, whisking it all' the time, then strain it 
off through a jelly bag; when nearly cold put in 
two tablespoon fuls of yeast, and the juice of twelve 
lemons ; let it stand till the next day, then skim it 
well, add the thinly pared rinds of the lemons, and 
also of thirty-six to forty-eight Seville oranges, 
together with the strained juice of the forty-eight 
oranges. Let it ferment for three days, then cask. 
The quantity of orange peel is a matter of taste, 
some people especially liking the somewhat bitter 
flavour they give, whilst others again dislike it 
intensely. You can also if preferred, use only sugar 
(121b. instead of the 81b. given\, W\. >iJafe\iW!«^ ^B2*^*

a very mellow flavour. For those who like it, a 
stalk or two of angelica may be put with the 
oranges in the pulping stage. 

Parsnip Wine, — Clean and quarter 41b. of 
parsnips, and put them on to boil with a gallon of 
water; when they are quite soft, strain off the 
liquor, being careful not to crush the parsnips in so 
doing. Now for each gallon of liquid add 81b. of 
sugar, and |oz. crude tartar. When nearly cold, 
put a toast spread with yeast to it, and let it stand 
for four days in a warm room, then strain and cask, 
bunging it up closely. If properly made, this pro- 
duces an uncommonly nice liquor. Our grand- 
mothers made horse-radish wine (reckoned a sovereign 
remedy for gout), by this recipe. 

Primrose Wine, Boil together for half an hour 
six gallons of water with 121b. roughly broken up 
loaf sugar, the juice of four juicy lemons (or four 
or live ripe limes), and the lightly whisked whites of 
four eggs, skimming it carefully and constantly. 
Now put into a delicately clean pan a full peck of 
primrose flowers, and the very thinly pared rinds of 
the lemons, or limes, and on this pour the syrup 
given above, whilst absolutely boiling. Stir this 
mixture for a few minutes with a silver spoon, or 
failing this anew, and freshly scalded wooden spoon. 
When it is all luke-warm, lay in a delicately toasted 
slice of bread spread with fresh yeast, cover the tub 
with a doubled blanket, and leave for three or four 
days, in a cool place. Now strain off the liquid, 
pressing the flowers with the hand to extract all 
their juice, and pour it into a delicately clean cask. 



LIQUEURS, WINES, &c. 83 

previously rinsed out with sherry or pale brandy, 
bung up loosely, and do not fasten up tightly till it 
ceases to hiss. Leave it in the cask for at least 
three months before bottling it. A gill of pale 
brandy to each gallon improves its keeping power, 
and all old cookery books recommend for this, and 
all "flower" wines, the addition of "a bottle of 
Ehenish," i.e., a bottle of white Rhine wine to each 
cask, put in like the brandy when the wine is strained 
into it. 

Baisin Wine, — Into a hogshead put 2cwt. of good 
raisins, and fill up with water. Steep this for a fuU 
fortnight, stirring it every day, then pour off the 
liquor, pressing the fruit to extract all the juice 
possible. Pour this liquor into a cask that will just 
hold it, remembering that it must be quite full. 
Bung loosely, and let it stand till it has quite ceased 
hissing, when you bung it down as tightly as possible, 
and let it stand for six months. Then rack it off 
into another cask, if it is quite dear, let it stand 
three months longer, and then bottle. Serve strained 
into a decanter. 

Bhuharh Wine. — Cut up into a large pan or tub 
about 61b. of nice rhubarb, bruising it well; then 
pour on to it a gallon of cold water and let it stand 
for five days, stirring it every night and morning ; 
then strain off the liquor, add to it about 41b. of cane 
loaf sugar, and, when this is dissolved, put in the 
thinly pared rind of a lemon, and ioz. of isinglass ; 
again let it stand for five days, till the fermentation 
is subsiding, when you either skim off the crust very 
carefully and pour off the wine, ox ^^afe ^cc»w S^ ^^JS.

by means of the tap without disturbing the crust 
(which is the best way), and cask it, not fastening it 
down completely for fourteen days. If this wine is 
to be drunk from the cask it needs no fortifying, but 
if to be kept, a giU of brandy should be added for 
every gallon made. Bottle off in six months, wiring 
down the corks. If it shows any signs of fermenting 
after it is in cask, strain it off into another clean 
cask. 

Rowan Wine, — G-ather the rowan berries when 
they are ripe, on a dry day, and put them into the 
mash tub with just enough boiling water to cover 
them. Let it all stand, covered, for three days, then 
draw off the liquid, without disturbing the crust, 
into a pan, and add to it lib. of best cane loaf sugar, 
or sugar candy crushed small, for each gallon of 
rowan liquor, and stir it well together tiU thoroughly 
dissolved, when it must be poured into a cask and 
left to work for a week, keeping the cask well filled 
up all the time (this is a most important point, and 
one that applies to every form of home-made wine) ; 
when it ceases to work, and is perfectly still, bung it 
down tightly and let it stand for six months, when 
it will be fit to bottle. 

White Heart Cherry TFiTie.— Take 71b. of white 
heart cherries and 71b. of white currants, together 
with 4oz. of angelica, previously sliced and boiled in 
three pints of water, and add to this 31b. of honey, 
and IJlb. to 21b. of apples grated without peeling. 
Put the cherries into the tub, and bruise them with 
a wooden pestle, breaking about a quarter of the 
stones in the process ; add to these the angelica and

if you are in a hurry and cannot a pare ao long a tiint^ 
ferment this wine in the first place with 2oa, of Ger- 
man yeast, mixed with a little tepid water and sugar, 
when it will work out in about twenty-four hours,

rinsed out with brandy or spirit.

remove the taint. Where such an accident has oc- 
curred, the only thing to do is to place a saucer with 
burning sulphur into it, making the cask as airtight 
as jou can, and thus thoroughly fumigate it; it 
must then be filled up with boiling water, strongly 
impregnated with salt and soda. But granted a little 
trouble in the rinsing and washing out, directly after 
use, this troublesome process can be perfectly avoided. 

A few recipes for home made herb beers may be 
given, though they no longer enjoy the popularity of 
" auld lan^ syrae." 

Home Brewed Beer, — Common barley, rather more 
than a quart; a wine-bottleful of distiller's barm 
(this will keep) ; powdered ginger, loz. ; treacle, 1 J 
to 21b. ; dried hops, loz. Boil the barley in a large 
pot (as it swells considerably) for three hours ; boil 
the hops separately, for a^>out one hour, and let it all 
stand till milk warm. Melt the treacle in a little 
hot water, then mix in the ginger, and finally stir 
together all tha ingredients carefully, adding the 
barm (about a tumblerful) at the last ; then stir it 
altogether, adding cold water as required, to weaken 
and cool it ; it must not be more than milk warm. 
The barm will rise, and can be skimmed off and used 
again. Do not bottle this beer till it has done work- 
ing, which it should have done in twelve hours. This 
beer, made in the afternoon, is fit for bottling the 
next day, and is very effervescent. First and last 
you would use for this a good pailful of water. 
Remember not to put the barm in while the mixture 
hot, the latter should be just as warm as tea for

the beer. This beer can be made without the barley, 
and is very nioe, but not as strong. Keep the barm 
tightly corked. (This recipe was given me by the 
daughter of a Highland farmer, whose mother always 
made it.) 

Mead, — To every gaUon of water add 41b. of honey, 
and boil it for an hour, then pour it into a tub, and 
when cool add a toast spread with yeast : cover with 
a blanket, and leave it for three or four days, and if 
by then it has fermented well, draw it off, and put it 
into a cask, adding a lemon sliced for every gallon, 
and about one and half pints of brandy for every ten 
gallons. The rinds of some Seville oranges, peeled 
very thin, and tied to a string, should be huDg in the 
cask for the time it is left unbunged (i. e. till the 
liquid is perfectly still), and then removed when it is 
bunged up. The cask, which must be perfectly 
sweet and clean, should be rinsed out with some of 
the brandy afterwards put to the wine. 

Cowslip. — Boil together 151b. of honey, 

and seven and a half gallons of water till one gallon 
has wasted, then lift it off the fire ; pour half a gal- 
lon of this liquid, boiling hot, on to nine quartered 
lemons, putting the rest of the liquor into a tub on to 
three full pecks of cowslip pips, and let the lemons 
and the flowers steep separately for twelve hours. 
Then pour the lemons and their liquor in with the 
cowslips, syrup, &c., adding a handful of sweetbriar ; 
when lukewarm, put in four tablespoonfuls of yeast, 
stir it well together, cover with a blanket, and leave 
it to work for four or five days, then draw off, into 
a cask, and bung down tightly when it haj& dssu^

hissing. Bottle in six months' time. Be very par- 
ticular as to your corks. It gives more flavour if the 
lemons are first thinly peeled, dear of all pith, and 
this peel laid with the quartered pulp. 

Nettle Beer, — ^Boil rather more than a peck of 
young nettle tops and 41b. of malt in two gallons of 
water, then add 2oz. of hops, 4oz. of sarsaparilla, 
Hlb. of sugar, and foz. of ginger; strain when 
nearly cold, and add a little yeast. Bottle whilst 
still fermenting. 

Qinger Beer, — lib. sugar, loz. ginger (bruised), 
and half a lemon to each gallon of water. Slice the 
lemon on to the sugar and ginger, and pour the 
water, boiling, over it aU. Wben this is cool add 
enough yeast to work it (about a tablespoonful to 
every two gallons), and let it stand for twelve hours, 
then bottle. Fit for use on the second day, and is 
very effervesceat. If fresh fruit is not attainable, 
use a tablespoonful of citric acid, and a teaspoonful 
of essence of lemon instead of the fresh lemon. 

Dandelion, Beer, — Boil three quarts of fresh dan- 
delions in a gallon of water, strain, and add 21b. of 
sugar, or a pound of molasses. When milk warm, 
add a good tablespoonful of yeast. Let it stand 
overnight, then draw off very carefully, add a table- 
spoonful of wintergreen, and bottle. This is an old 
country wife's recipe, but dandelion beer is seldom 
seen nowadays, being usually replaced by the follow- 
ing, which is still very popular in the country. Put 
into a crock three quarts of freshly gathered dande- 
lion blossoms, and pour over them a gallon of boiling 
water; let this stand all night uncovered. Next day

strain off the liqaor, and boil it with ^Ib. of sugar 
for half an hour, then add to it the rinds of two 
sweet oranges and two lemons, Terj thinly pared, 
quite free from all white pith, and preriouslj weU 
bruised, and when milk warm add a toast spread 
with yeast. Let it stand seven to ten days before 
putting it into a cask, then bottle in three months, 
adding a lump or two of sugar to each bottle. In 
the country this wine is often not put into a cask at 
all, but simply drunk from the crock, which is kept 
eoYered with a cloth or a board to keep out the dust. 
Country wives consider it a splendid tonic, or as they 
phrase it, ** excellent for clearing the blood." 

Lastly, it may be mentioned that foreign house- 
wives make aU sorts of essences and tinctures by the 
simple process of infusing the desired aromatic in 
strong rectified spirit or even brandy, till the latter is 
strongly flavoured, keeping such tinctures very 
closely stoppered, as these flavours are usually very 
volatile. For instance, infuse the very thinly pared 
rind of some lemons in good brandy, keeping it 
closely stoppered, and shaldng it daily. Essence of 
allspice, cloves, cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, &c., can 
all be prepared in this way. Essence of ginger can 
be made by infusing loz. of bruised ginger in half a 
pint of strong spirit, with the thinly pared rind of 
half a lemon. These essences need no further treat- 
ment, if to be only used in the kitchen, but, if 
carefully filtered and mixed with a proportion of 
sugar syrup to taste, they will produce some very fair 
home-made liqueurs, which will, at all events, possess 
the merit of unconventionality. 



CHAPTEE VII. 

PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Pickles were formerly almost inevitably home-made, 
and in each household there was some little private 
method of preserving some out-of-the-way article, 
the secret of which the housewife guarded almost as 
carefully as she would her life. Give a bottle of her 
pickle ? Why certainly, if the friendship warranted 
it ; but give the recipe, even to her nearest, never. 
However, since those days very few of us take the 
trouble to manufacture such addenda, though in 
truth few things more repay the small amount of 
labour involved. Pickles are like all other preserves ; 
the best material alone should be used, the vegetables 
chosen should be sound, ripe, but not over ripe, and 
freshly gathered on a dry, and if possible, warm day. 
The vinegar should be above suspicion. For ordinary 
pickles the best brown malt vinegar answers admir- 
ably, but its quality must be first-rate: for more 
delicate preparations the very best French, or white 
wine vinegar should alone be used. Copper pans or 
metal spoons must be carefully avoided, unglazed 
»neware is far and away the safest for anything 
connected with vinegar, and clean if not new, wooden 



PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 91 

spoons shoTild alone be used. Glass bottles (Bjland's 
make are most useful for these) or jars are the best 
for storing, but of course where pickles in large quan- 
tities are made, stone jars may be used ; only re- 
member in this case, to be particular in the covering ; 
if to be stored for some time, place a piece of bladder 
over the mouth of the bottle, force the cork in over 
this, and then tie down carefully with more moist- 
ened bladder. Another way is to put a piece of 
vegetable parchment into the neck, force in the cork 
as before, and then dip the mouth and neck of the 
bottle into boiling wax, which can be either bought 
ready made, or else may be made thus at home : melt 
lib. of common red sealing wax, with lib. of black 
resin, and ^ib. of beeswax, melting it all over a very 
gentle fire, and stirring it during the process with a 
tallow candle to prevent its burning. Or the recipe 
for bottling- wax, previously given, will answer. Any 
way never think covering a jar with brown paper, 
however many the folds, will keep a jar airtight, for 
it ynll not, paper in itself not being airproof . Old- 
fashioned housewives, who always kept a store of 
pickles, <fec., and prided themselves on their keeping 
powers, used to cork the jars and bottles but loosely for 
the first two days, and then fill them up with scalded 
vinegar to the very neck, and lastly fasten them down 
closely ; for the pickles absorb a great deal of the 
vinegar first poured into them, yet, unless they are 
perfectly covered with the liquid they will not keep. 
It must be borne in mind that all fermented liquors 
lose by boiling, so the vinegar should never (unless 
the contrary be expressly stated in tha ic^^stcn^^ \^

more than scalded, or boiled up sharply, witl: the 
spices, <&c., used to flavour it. Avery useful flavoui - 
ing vinegar for most pickles may be made by boiling 
up together a gallon of good malt vinegar, about lOoz. 
of salt, 2oz. to 3oz. of bruised ginger, Joz. of mace, 2oz. 
to 3oz. of shallots, a teaspoonful of cayenne, f oz. of 
mustard seed, and 1 oz, of turmeric ; let this simmer 

together after the boil up, for fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, and when cold put it into a stone jar ; into 
which you can throw, as they ripen, any yegn tables 
that come handy, such as broken up cauliflower, 
French beans, tiny cucumbers or gherkins, onions, 
radishes, &c., &c., using perfectly fresh vegetables, 
carefully wiped free from grit, or dirt ; being very 
particular to keep the jar closely covered all the time, 
recovering it tightly each time you add anything to 
it. This pickle, which will be in condition in eight 
or nine months, makes a very nice household piccallili, 
with the least amount of trouble. As a matter of 
fact almost every household has its own views on the 
flavouring of pickle vinegar, but care must be taken 
to keep it delicate, or it will overpower the flavour of 
the vegetables. 

Artichoke Bottoms, to pickle, — ^Boil the artichokes 
until you can remove all the leaves, and clear the 
bottoms thoroughly from the choke, &c. Lay each 
as done in salt and water, and leave them in this for an 
hour ; then lift them out on to a clean cloth and leave 
them till dry, when you pack them in wide mouthed 
bottles, with a little mace and sliced nutmeg between 
them and then fill up with pure white wine vinegar pre* 
nousljr scalded. If preferred, the vinegar may be just

boiled up with the nutmeg and mace, and then when 
cold, strained on to the artichoke bottoms. 

Asparagus, to pickle. — Well clean and scrape the 
heads, removing the tough part of the white ; lay the 
part to be preserved in cold spring water for two 
hours ; meanwhile boil some fresh spring or filtered 
water in a large pan with a handful of salt, and when 
this is boiling put in the asparagus a few pieces at a 
time, loose, and just scald them, lifting them out as 
soon as they are done with a skimmer, and lay them 
on a clean doth. Have ready a boiling pickle, pre- 
pared as below, and as soon as the asparagus is cold 
lay it into jars, and pour on the spiced vinegar ; let it 
all stand, covered with a three or four times folded 
linen doth, for a week, then pour off the vinegar, boil 
it up again sharply, and again pour this on the 
asparagus. Aga,in let it stand a week, and repeat 
this boiling up a second time, then cover down closely 
with cork and bladder, or seal it well. For the 
vinegar: boil up two gallons of best white wine 
vinegar, with 1 oz, baysalt, J oz. each of mace and 
white peppercorns and two nutmegs. Use when 
boiling. 

Barberries, to pickle. — Choose the barberries when 
not over-ripe, cleanse them from all leaves, dead 
stalks, <&c., and lay them in a jar with a (very) few 
cloves, pour a salt and water pickle over them, and 
when you see a scum rising on them pour off the first 
pickle, and replace with fresh brine. They need no 
vinegar, their own acidity being sufficient. (Old- 
fashioned housewives prepared red currants in the- 
same way.) 



94 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Beetroot, to picJcle, — These vegetables require great 
€are in washing them, for if the least bit of skin or 
fibre is injured in the operation, all the colouring 
matter will exude at once. When thus carefully 
washed, boil for an hour (putting them on in boiling 
water — or they may be baked), and let them stand till 
perfectly cold. Now scrape and slice them, lay them 
in a stone jar, and either pour over them vinegar in 
which you have previously boiled a few peppercorns, 
a clove or two, and a red chilli or two ; or tie up the 
spice in a piece of muslin, lay it with the beetroot, and 
pour scalded vinegar over it all. Cover down closely 
•and see that the beetroot is thoroughly covered with 
vinegar. It is well to be sparing with spice in this 
pickle as the flavour of the beetroot is very easily 
overpowered. Moreover it is one that is better made 
fresh and fresh. Carrots treated in the same way make 
an excellent pickle, and some people even mix beet- 
root and carrot in making this pickle. (Cold carrots 
left over from dinner, may be utilised in this way 
with advantage, if thoroughly rinsed free from all 
gravy or fat, before adding the vinegar. But natur- 
ally the flavour is better if the carrots are specially 
prepared for the pickle, treating them precisely in 
the same way as the beetroot. 

Cabbage, Sauerkraut. — This is a favourite German 
pickle and is not at all difficult to prepare, granted a 
little care. Choose large firm cabbages with good 
white hearts, and leave these in a cool comer of the 
Kjellar for a day or two before using them. Mean- 
while line a crock, or a small keg, with cabbage or 
'vme-leareB, then shred the cabbages down very finely 



PICKLES AlTD FBESEBYES. 95 

into the keg, sprinkling fine salt pretty evenly be- 
tween the layers. (Be careful not to use too mucli 
salt, or the kraut will not ferment properly, A good 
handful will be enough for a fairly large crock.) 
Press the shredded cabbage down veiy tight, and close, 
as you put it in, and when the crock is as full as it 
can possibly hold, sprinkle a little more salt over the 
top, then cover it all over, first with cabbage or vine- 
leaves, then with a doubly folded clean cloth. Now 
put a wooden cover over the top, weighting this down 
well with a heavy weight, and set the crock in a 
warm cellar till it starts fermenting, t.e. when little 
white bubbles form on the surface of the mass. Now 
transfer the keg to a cooler place and leave it till the 
brine dries into a firm crust over the top, when it is 
ready for use. Once a week the leaves at the top 
must be renewed, and the linen cloth well washed in 
cold water, and put back. This is the common way of . 
making this, but little alterations are made in various 
families, as for instance the addition of carraway 
seeds, juniper berries, &c. Use a wooden spoon for 
lifting it out, and see that there is ^dways just 
sufficient brine to cover the cabbage, and be particular 
about keeping it covered with the linen cloth and the 
weighted board. 

Cabbage, Yellow Pickle. — Choose fine white and 
tender cabbages, and cut them in four or eight, accor- 
ding to their size. Soak these in strong brine for three 
days, then scald in dear water till you can pierce 
them with a straw. Now lift them out and lay them 
to dry, on large dishes, for twenty-four hours ; after 
which, put them into strong ^7m<^i^diX ^w>Ski «qS^^ssssc^»

turmeric to make it all yellow. Leave it in tliis for 
ten days, then take it out, and drain on a reversed 
sieve for some hours. Now prepare the following : 
3oz. turmeric, 2oz. ginger, 4oz. grated horseradish, 
2oz. white mustard seed, 2oz. whole white pepper, 
4oz. garlic, |oz. celery seed, |^oz. mace, and mix these 
all well together. Then pack the cabbages in a 
crock, strewing each layer thickly with the mixed 
spice, alternating each layer, till the crock is full ; 
then pour over it all two gallons of vinegar, pre- 
viously boiled up with 51b. of sugar, and poured hot 
over the pickle. These quantities are for four good 
cabbages. (A Creole recipe.) 

Cabbage, Red. — Strip off the outer leaves, quarter 
the cabbage, remove the hard stalk, and then shred 
the rest pretty finely. Spread this shredded cabbage 
out on a large flat dish, strew over it a good handful 
of fine salt, cover it all with another dish, and let it 
stand for twenty-four hours, when it must be drained 
in a colander, and finally dried in a clean cloth. 
Place this shred cabbage into stone jars, and pour 
over it good vinegar, previously boiled up with an 
ounce of whole black peppers to each quart of vine- 
gar. Some people use only unscalded vinegar, but 
this is not so successful. Tie this down with bladder, 
and mind the cabbage is thoroughly well covered 
with the vinegar. This pickle is soon ready, but 
loses both colour and crispness if kept over long. 
Choose the red cabbage of a rich purply colour, when 
the leaves have been just touched with the frost. 

Cauliflower, to pickle. — This is simply trimmed and 
broken up into even pieces, strewed with salt, and 



PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 97 

left for twelve to twenty-four hours between two 
plates ; tlien well drained, packed in jars, and covered 
with cold vinegar, previously just boiled up with 
spice. Many persons, however, think this pickle 
more wholesome if the cauliflower is first quickly 
parboiled in salt and water, then drained, packed, 
and finished off as before. 

Celery, to pickle, — Cut some heads of celery into 
equal and convenient lengths, wash them thoroughly, 
then throw them into brine, strong enough to bear 
an egg, and leave them in this for eight or ten days. 
Now rinse the celery thoroughly, and leave it to 
drain on a sieve or a colander till dry. Then 
pack the celery in stone jars, and pour over it 
enough spiced and scalded vinegar to cover it all 
thoroughly, let it stand till cold, filling up with 
more vinegar, if necessary, and then cork down 
closely. 

Celeriac, cardoons, salsify, seakale, &c., can all be 
pickled in this way. 

Cucumbers, to pickle. — Choose the smallest and 
most perfect cucumbers, as free from spots as pos- 
sible, lay them in strong salt and water till they turn 
quite yeUow (which they will do in about nine or ten 
days), stirring them twice a day to keep them from 
softening. When they are perfectly yeUow, pour off 
the water from them, and cover them with plenty of 
vine leaves. Now boil up the water poured from the 
cucumbers, and when it boils pour it over them, and 
leave it all in a warm corner near the fire. When 
the water is once more almost cold, again boil it u^^ 
and again pour it on the cuc\nnbet^\ x^^^-ai^ >0c^

process till you see the cuciimbers turn a good green 
(which they should do in four or five scaldings), 
being careful to keep them covered with vine leares, 
and then a clean cloth ; and last of all a soup plate 
turned over the basin in which they are, to keep in the 
steam, which helps to colour them quicker. When 
thoroughly greened, drain them on a sieve, and then 
pour the following pickle, hot, upon them, and tie 
down with bladders. For the pickle ; to each quart 
of white wine vinegar, allow J^oz. of mace, or five or 
six cloves, ^oz. sliced ginger, ^oz. black pepper, and 
half a handful of salt ; boil this altogether for five 
minutes, then use hot. 

Cucumber Mangoes, — Choose large, green, and not 
too ripe cucumbers, and take a strip out all down one 
side ; through this remove all the seeds with a 
teaspoon, and pound some of these seeds with scraped 
horseradish, finely shred garlic, mustard seed, and 
white pepper ; fill the cucumbers up as full as 
possible with this mixture, then replace the strip cut 
out, and tie it into place with thread. Place them in 
a basin, and pour enough boiling hot vinegar over 
them to cover them ; next day pour off the vinegar, 
boil it up again, and again pour it over the cucum- 
bers ; repeat this twice more, at twenty-four hours' 
interval, and the. last time boil up the vinegar with 
5:oz. each of mace and cloves, loz. each pepper and 
mustard seed, half a stick of horseradish, and hiylf 
a clove of garlic to each quart of vinegar. Pack the 
cucumbers in jars, pour the boiling vin^ar over 
them, tie down closely and store. (This pickle f^ n 
also be made in precisely the same way with melons 



PICKLE3 AND PRESERVES. 99 

of the kind used for pickling, peaches, lemons, vege- 
table marrows, &c.) 

Cucumbers with Mustard. — Slice some not too ripe 
cucumbers, or cut them into inch lengths, and quarter 
these ; slice also some good large onions very thinly, 
and arrange these in layers on a dish, with saJt 
sprinkled upon each layer, turn another plate over 
them, and let them drain for six hours or so ; have 
ready some good spiced vinegar as for other pickles, 
mix with this a dessertspoonful of good mustard for 
each quart of vinegar (adding this when mixed with 
a little warm vinegar, when the spices and vinegar 
have been boiled up together), pour it, all hot, 
over the cucumber, &c., and leave till next day, when 
you bottle and, cork it all down. This pickle, though 
excellent, does not keep over well, so should be eaten 
soon. 

Eggs, to pickle, — ^Boil the eggs well for half an 
hour, then let them cool, and shell them. Now place 
them in jars, and pour over them some scalding hot 
vinegar, previously boiled up with allspice, whole 
peppers, cloves, ginger, and a few cloves of garlic. 
Let it all stand till cold, then cork down very closely. 
They must be well covered with the vinegar. Excel- 
lent with cold meat. 

Elder Buds, to pickle. — Gather the elder buds 
when of the size of hop buds, and leave them in 
strong brine for nine days, stirring them daily. 
Then drain off the water, put the buds in a pai 
well covered with vine leaves, and pour on to them 
the water drained from them. Set them over a 
slow fire till they are quite green, then «ktT?vxsN.N5^'K«v

off into jars and pour on to them good malt vinegar 
boiled for two or three minutes with a little mace, 
some shallots, and a little sliced ginger. Cover well 
with this vinegar, then tie down closely and store. 

Elder Flowers, to pickle, — Q-atlier the elder 
flowers before they are actually open, pack them 
into ]ai*s, and pour over them enough scalded white 
wine vinegar to cover them, then cork down. This 
is an old-fashioned but most excellent accompani- 
ment to cold meat, especially boiled mutton. 

Elder Shoots, to pickle (also called English 
Bamboo), — Cut the young shoots of the elder about 
the middle of May, choosing the middle shoots, 
which are the tenderest ; peel off the outside peel, 
and lay the shoots in strong brine for one night. 
Dry them very carefully, and separately, in a clean 
cloth, then put them into a stone jar and cover 
with the following spiced vinegar when boiling hofr; 
cork closely, and set it by the fire for two hours to 
keep hot, turning the jar pretty often. If the 
shoots are not green when cold, strain off the 
vinegar, re-heat it, and again pour it on the elder, 
and let it stand by the fire as before. Elder shoots 
are a great addition to the so-called '* India pickle," 
and can be prepared in May by simply pouring 
boiling vinegar and mustard seed over them, and 
keeping them well covered till you want them for 
the pickle. For the vinegar for this pickle, boil up 
a quart of good vinegar with loz. each of white 

pper and sliced ginger, with a little mace and 
pimento to taste. 

French Beans, to pickle. — Choose young even-sized 



PICKLES AND PRESERVES 101 

beans, wipe them in a clean cloth and lay them in 
strong brine for three days, stirring them daily; 
now put them into a pan covered with vine leaves, 
and fill up with weak salt and water, and let them 
cook over a gentle fire till they turn green; then 
drain them, put them into jars, and pour boiling 
spiced vinegar over them. Mind it should cover 
them by quite two inches. Gherkins are excellent 
preserved in this way. 

Fruit, to pickle. — ^When the fruit trees require 
thinning in the spring, collect all the green fruit 
thus thinned out, such as apricots, apples (green and 
young), nectarines, peaches, plums, &c., and throw 
them as gathered into a pan of cold vinegar ; then 
collect every sort of vegetable, such as gherkins, cucum- 
bers (cut in jin. rings, and the seeds removed), nas- 
turtiums, young carrots, turnip radishes, cauliflower 
broken into sprays, little onions, French beans, &c., 
and put these also into the cold vinegar. Let these 
all stand till September or October, when to a gallon 
of vinegar you add 4oz. each of black and white 
pepper, ginger, and mixed spice (mace, allspice, 
cloves), Jib. yellow mustard seed, one nutmeg grated, 
two sticks of horseradish, 2oz. of salt, 5oz. of chillies, 
and 4oz. mustard flour, mixed to a smooth paste with 
a little of the vinegar. Boil this all up together, put 
it into jars and cover down when cold. Mind there 
is enough liquid to cover it all well. This is often 
called Piccalilli. 

Grapes, to pickle. — Choose the grapes when full 
grown but still unripe, and cut them into little 
bunches ; noT^r put them, into ^ «»\jo\i'fe \^Mt ^SJOo. ^vis^

leaves under and above each layer, and cover it all 
with some good brine ; lay vine leaves over the top, 
tie them down with a clean cloth, and then cover with 
a plate. Let them stand in this for twenty-four 
hours, then lift them out, lay them on a clean cloth, 
cover with another, and leave them till dry. 
Meanwhile, boil together two quarts of vinegar, one 
quart of spring water, and lib. of coarse sugar, and 
skim off all the scum as it rises ; then let it stand till 
cold. Now dry the first jar carefully, put in some 
fresh vine leaves, and lay in the grapes again with 
more vine leaves between each layer ; then pour the 
clear part of the pickle over the grapes, being 
careful that they are well covered by the vine- 
gar, and place a flannel-covered board on the top 
to keep the fruit well under the liquid ; then cork 
and cover down closely. Take them out with a 
wooden spoon only, and be very careful to cover down 
the jar each time, or they will certainly be spoiled. 
For the brine, dry and crush a pound of bay salt, 
-ttnd dissolve it in as much cold spring water as you 
want to cover the grapes, adding enough best salt to 
make a brine that will bear an egg. Let this all boil 
well together, carefully removing all the black scum, 
and when it has boiled for fifteen minutes, put it 
aside to cool and settle, pouring the clear part, when 
almost cold, over the grapes. 

Lemons, to pickle, — Wipe eight good lemons care- 
fully, then gash them equally four times, from stalk 
to crown, but without dividing them ; now stuff them 
with as much salt as you can make them hold, and 
2aj them in a deep dish, in a sunny window, or a 



PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 103 

warm place for a week or ten days, keeping them 
often turned and basted with their own liquor ; then 
rub them well with loz. or 2oz. of pale turmeric, and 
put them with their juice into a stone jar, with two 
or three cloves of garlic, peeled, and twelve small 
onions, each stuck with two cloves. Now in 
two quarts of white wine vinegar boil |lb. of 
slightly bruised ginger, Jib. mustard seed and 
2oz. whole black peppers, and pour this all, 
straight off the fire, on to the lemons, cover 
the jar with a plate, let it stand till next day, then 
add to it six or seven capsicums or chillies, and cover. 
Limes make a delicious pickle in the same way, but 
should only lie in the salt four or five days, and all 
the salt (of which 2oz. will be required for every six 
Limes), left unmelted must be put into the jar with 
them, before pouring in the vinegar, &c. 

Melons, to pickle. — Take a couple of melons before 
they are quite ripe, pare off the rinds, remove all the 
seeds, and slice the flesh about half an inch thick. 
Steep these in good white wine vinegar for a week 
or ten days, then cover them with cold fresh 
vinegar and sinmier them very gently in this, till 
perfectly tender. Now drain them thoroughly on 
a reversed sieve, and when cold, stick each slice 
with a couple of cloves, put them into glass 
jars and cover with cold syrup made by boiling 
together a pint of water and lOoz. of sugar for twenty 
minutes. In a week, lift them out of this syrup, 
drain them a little, again put them into glass jars 
and pour over them sufficient white wine vinegar

recipe, and is an excellent way of using up the last 
melons of the season, which will not ripen properly. 
The melons should be about three days or so of 
being ripe. 

Mushrooms, to jpichle, (Button,) — ^Take the tiny 
button mushrooms, and after well cleaning them with 
a flannel, lay them in cold white wine vinegar, and 
bring this very slowly to the boil, now drain them 
well, till cold, then put them in glasses and cover 
with white vinegar, previously scalded and left till 
cold. 

For this, choose the white meadow mush- 
rooms, freshly gathered ; cut the stems off close, and 
wipe the mushrooms well with a damp flannel dipped 
in fine salt, throwing them as done into lightly salted 
water ; when a'l are done, dry them carefully between 
dry clean cloths. (Unless this is attended to the 
quality of the pickle will be weakened.) Now to a 
quart of vinegar put 1| teaspoonfuls of salt, ^oz. of 
white peppercorns, ^oz. of ginger, a saltspoonful of 
cayenne, and a good blade of mace. Let this all boil 
up well, then lay in the mushrooms, and let them cook 
from five to ten minutes according to size (it is 
well to have them as even in size as possible) ; now 
turn them into warm wide-mouthed bottles, cover 
with the vinegar, and divide the Apice amongst them. 
When cold, cork down and seal. Store in a cool 
and dry place but beware of frost. 

Nasturtiums, to p^hle, — Make a pickle by dissolving 
l^oz. of fine salt in a quart of white vinegar, and 
throw the nasturtium seeds into this as they become

fit. They should be quite young. Mind they are well 
covered with the vinegar. Nasturtium flowers make 
a nice pickle in this way : Put the full blown flowers 
into a quart bottle with a minced shallot or two, and 
fill up the bottle with cold scalded vinegar, let it 
stand for two months then rub it all through a 
sieve, bottle off, seasoning with cayenne and salt to 
taste. 

Onions, to pickle. — Choose the smallest onions 
possible for this, and peel them. For a quart of 
onions take a quart of best white wine vinegar and 
dissolve in it a good dessertspoonful of salt and a 
tablespoonftd of whole white peppers, bring this to 
the boil, remove all the scum as it rises, then throw 
in the onions and let them cook till thev become clear, 
— which they do in about three or 'four minutes — 
then turn them into jars, and pour the pickle over 
them. Of course, if liked, other spice can be added 
to the vinegar at discretion, but that is entirely a 
matter of taste. Shallots are pickled in precisely 
the same way. 

Oysters, to pickle, — Scald some fine large oysters 
in their own liquor, with a small piece of butter to 
every hundred oysters. When they are plump and 
white, lift them out with a skimmer and spread them 
on a thickly folded cloth, When they are firm and 
cold, heat together half their liquor and the same 
quantity of good vinegar, now put the oysters into 
wide-mouthed glass jars, strewing each layer of 
oysters with a spoonful of ground mace, and a 
dozen each of cloves, whole peppers, and allspice, 
and pour the liquor over it all. A.dA a> %\^\AxiS. <5^

sweet salad oil to exclude the air, and cover down 
close. These, if well closed and stored in a cool 
place, will keep good for moaths. 

Peaches or Apricots, to pickle. — Quarter unripe 
peaches, and lay them in a basin for a night, well 
sprinkled with salt, then dry them for two or three 
Hays in the sun. Meanwhile, prepare a sauce thus : 
Put a full 2Joz. each of crushed (but not powdered) 
ginger, and sugar, with a spoonful or two of turmeric 
to the quart of vinegar, and let it all boil up ; when 
boiling, lay in the dried peaches, bring the vinegar, 
&c., again to the boil, then simmer for an hour, 
after which cork up closely in a stone jar. 

Samphire, to pickle, — Throw some good green 
samphire into a pan with two or three handf uls of 
salt according to quantity, and cover with cold 
spring water. Let it stand for twenty-four hours, 
put it into a clean pan, add another handful of salt, 
and cover it with good vinegar. Cover down the 
pan, let it cook till the samphire is green and 
crisp, then lift it off that moment and turn it into a 
jar with its vinegar, and cover down. When quite 
cold, cover with cork and bladder and put it away. 
The secret of this pickle is to lift it off the fire the 
moment it has greened and crisped, for if left long 
enough to soften, it is spoiled. Samphire can be 
kept all the year round, if s' re 1 in strong salt and 
water brine, draining it out a^ wanted, and leaving 
it to steep for a few minutes in best vinegar before 
using it. 

Strawberries, to pickle. — Place in a jar alternate 
layers of stalked strawberries and crushed cloves 



PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 107 

and cinnamon, till the jar is full ; pour to them a 
sjrup made with 31b, of sugar boiled in half a pint 
of cider or white vinegar for five minutes, and let 
this all stand for twenty-four hours. Now pour off 
the liquid from the berries, bring it to the boil, pour 
it back over them and again let it all stand for 
twenty-four h6urs ; after which boil the berries and 
the syrup together for twenty minutes, slowly, then 
pot and cover them. This is for six quarts of straw- 
berries. 

• Tomatoes to pickle (American), — Chop finely to- 
gether a peck of green tomatoes and eight large 
green peppers. Soak these for twenty-four hours in 
weak brine, then drain off the latter, and add a 
head of finely chopped cabbage to the tomatoes, 
scald it all in boiling vinegar for twenty minutes, 
then drain off the vinegar ; put the tomatoes, <fcc., 
into a stone jar, add to it three pints of grated 
horseradish and spice to taste, and fill up with strong 
cold vinegar ; or if preferred, put in the horseradish 
and fill up with scalded spiced vinegar. 

Walnuts, to pickle, — ^The nuts should be gathered 
when they can be pierced with a pin easily, for if the 
shell can be felt at all they are too ripe for pickling. 
Make enough brine to cover them thoroughly, 
using 6oz. of salt to the quart of water, carefully 
removing all the scum that will rise as the salt dis- 
solves, before laying in the nuts, and stir them night 
and morning. Change the brine every three days, 
then on the ninth day strain off the walnuts and 
leave them on dishes exposed to the air till they turn 
quite black, which they should do in tw^b^^ \ii5>K«.'^ 'ib^

the outside. Boil together half a gallon of vinegar 
for every hundred walnuts, with a tea- spoonful of 
salt, 2oz. black pepper, 3oz. bruised ginger, a drachm 
of mace, and from j to |oz. of cloves stuck in two 
or three small onions, and 4oz. mustard seed. Let 
this all boil together for five minutes, have the wal- 
nuts packed in a stone jar, and pour the vinegar, &g. 
over them straight off the fire. When this is all quite 
cold, cover down closely and keep in a dry place. Be 
careful to have the walnuts always covered with the 
vinegar, adding fresh, when necessary, but always 
boiling this up, before adding: it to the pickle. 



CHAPTEE VIII. 

PICKLES (Continued), 

One form of pickle seldom if ever seen here, though 
a great favourite abroad, is pickled fruit, and, strange 
though the idea may sound, the result is undeniably 
toothsome. The vinegar used must, needless to say, 
be of the finest quality, white wine vinegar being 
decidedly the best; the bottles or jars used (which 
are nicest if Eyland's), must be thoroughly cleaned, 
and scalded out, and then kept in a dry, warm plat^t^ 
out of the dust for three or four days to air and dry 
perfectly. Make a pickle with one and a half pints 
of best vinegar, three quarters of a pint of Ught white 
wine, some broken up cinnamon, and a dozen or so 
of cloves, and when this is all boiUng lay in the fruit 
(this quantity of pickle is for 3|lb. to 41b. of fruit), 
and let it cook in the vinegar, &c., for five minutes ; 
then lift them out with a skimmer, and place thoni 
in the jars, after draining them lightly ; now boil uj> 
the pickle again, and pour over the fruit whilst still 
warm, close tightly, and store in a cool dry place. Or 
try the following : 

Cherries in vinegar. — Pick over the fruit, after 
stalking it, and pack it in glass jars ; now boil ^^\sv>t

best vinegar with a good pinch of sugar, a few cloves, 
and some peppercorns (say seven or eight of each to 
each pint of vinegar used), let it cool, then pour it 
whilst still warm, on to the packed fruit, and cover 
down. Small plums can also be done in this way. 

Apricots in vinegar. — Boil three quarters of a pint 
of best vinegar with 21b. of sugar ; after the latter is 
thoroughly dissolved, skim it well, and lay in the 
apricots, peeled, halved and stoned; let them get 
thoroughly hot, then drain them from the pickle and 
pack them in jars, strewing them as you pack them» 
with ioz. coarsely pounded and mixed cinnamon and 
cloves between the layers of fruit ; then boil up the 
vinegar drained from them with a few Jamaica pep- 
pers, and pour it, when just hot, on to the fruit, 
close down the jars, and put them aside. After two 
or three days, poui* off the liquor, let it just boil up 
again, then return it to the jars, and close these 
down very tightly. 

Melons in pickle. — Choose melons that are not too 
ripe, peel them, .cut them in slices, scoop out all the 
pithy part, and lay them in preserving jars. Boil 
one and a half pints of vinegar with l|lb. of sugar, 
some broken cinnamon, white peppercorns, lemon 
peel, twelve cloves, and a little ginger. Pour this 
over the melons when nearly cold. After twenty-four 
hours put the liquor back into the pan with a little 
more sugar, boil it till it thickens like a syrup, and 
pour it over the melons. This must be repeated 
twice, at the interval of a week, adding more vinegar 
if necessary. Tie down with parchment soaked in 
brandy, &<5. 



PICKLES. Ill 

Pears in pickle. — For 91b. of fruit allow 31b. of 
sugar, one quart of Tinegar, joz. of cinnamon, and 
the rind of one lemon. This fruit pickles remarkably 
well. When just ripe, peel the pears very smoothly, 
halve them, remove the core, and wash quickly in 
fresh cold water. Meantime boil the vinegar, sugar, 
<&e., skim it, and put in as many pears as will lie side 
by side without overcrowding. Now boil these 
quickly, over a brisk fire, till soft. If left in too long 
they will turn brown and \msightly. Lift them out 
with a skimmer, and put them carefully in jars, 
round side uppermost, never touching them with a 
fork. Proceed thus till all are done, then pour the 
syrup over them. After a few days, boil up the 
liquor again as stated above. 

Large Plums (white or red), in pickle. — ^Wipe 61b. of 
picked fruit very gently with a clean cloth, scald them 
with very hot water, lifting them out quickly, and re- 
moving the peel at once. If they are to be stoned, the 
plums must be less ripe and should be stoned before 
scalding. Boil l^lb. of sugar in a pint of vinegar, 
with Joz. of cinnamon, the thinly peeled rind of one 
lemon, and a few cloves ; when it is boiling scald the 
fruit, a few at a time, in this hot pickle (which must 
not be allowed to boil during the process) for two 
minutes, boiling up the pickle between each set of 
fruit. When all the fruit has been scalded, again 
boil up the pickle, then draw the pan to the side, off 
the fire, and put in all the fruit; let it soak till 
thoroughly moistened, then at once fill up the jars 
with the fruit and juice, tying them down whilst still 
warm. Be careful to boil up the liquor a^ain ^^'^-^ 



112 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

time it begins to look watery. If liked, the plums 
can be preserved in this way without peeling. 

This is necessarily not an ezbaustive list, but the 
above directions will allow of any one so minded pre- 
paring all kinds of fruit in this way. Whilst on the 
subject of sweet-sour preserves (as these fruit pickles 
are sometimes called), a few of the fruit c6mpote8 
served abroad with game may be given. 

Lemon Compote. — Peel one lemon and one orange* 
removing every particle of white pith, then mince up 
the yellow part of the i)eel and all the pulp into dice, 
put these in the pan, with just enough water to cover 
them, and bring it all just to (but not beyond) boil- 
ing point ; then add a wineglassf ul of red wine, a 
tablespoonful of brown sauce, a little salt, cayenne 
pepper, and the juice of one more lemon and orange, 
and use. 

Pear Compote. — Peel some pears, dropping them 
into cold water slightly acidulated with lemon juice» 
as you do so ; then place them into hot water with 
sugar to taste, a piece of stick cinnamon, and the 
thinly pared rind of a lemon ; bring it all to the boil, 
very slowly, being careful to lift out the pears before 
they get soft enough to mash, boil up the syrup 
again, skim it well, and then pour it gently over and 
round the pears with a spoon, after adding to it a 
good wineglassful of claret. 

Cranberry Compote. — Lay some mce, unbruised 
cranberries into fresh water, then turn them out on a 
hair sieve, and allow all the liquid to drain off them. 
Now put the cranberries into a preserving pan with 
caster sugar, allowing lib. of sugar to every 21b, of 



PICKLES. 113 

fruit, and cook slowly, till the berries are soft but 
not mashy ; then lift them out, and boil up the 
syrup sharply till it is thick, when you mix the 
cranberries into it and pour the two into jars, 
covering each with a brandied paper, and covering 
down tightly when the fruit is cold. 

Sweet Tomato Compote. — Slice down some nice 
tomatoes, till you have 71b. of these sKces, and let 
them stand for twenty-four hours, well sprinkled with 
salt. Then soak them for the same length of time 
in fresh water ; after which drain it all well. Now 
for these 71b. take 4|lb. of sugar, loz. cinnamon, loz. 
cloves, and enough vinegar to cover them. Boil this 
all together and pour it over the tomatoes ; let it 
stand twenty-four hours, then bring it all just to the 
boil, pot it, tie it down, and store in a cool dark place. 

Catsups. — Anchovy Catsup. — Chop tip (without 
boning) twenty-four anchovies, mince ten shallots, 
and scrape finely a handful of horseradish ; put these 
into a pan with joz. mace, a quart of white wine, a 
pint of red wine, a pint of anchovy liquor, twelve 
cloves, and twelve peppercorns, and boil it all slowly 
together till reduced to a quart ; then strain, bottle, 
and keep in a dry place. (An old-fashioned, but 
very good addition to many sauces.) 

Camp Catsup. — Put into a pan a quart of strong 
old beer, a pint of white wine, 2oz. of anchovies, 
l|oz. of peeled shallots, ioz. each of mace and nut- 
meg, and one and a haK races of ginger crushed. 
Boil this all over a gentle fire till a third part is 
evaporated, then bottle next day without straining. 

Cockle Catsup, — Scald a quart oi o.^Os^sse*, ^Sa.^^

and mince them; then boil them up in their own 
liquor, and a teacupful of cider, or white wine 
vinegar ; skim very carefully, then let them simmer 
for three minutes longer, when you strain them 
through a hair sieve, and return the liquor thus ob- 
tained to the pan with a teaspoonf nl each of cayenne, 
salt, and mace, and a gill of sherry. Boil this 
altogether for fifteen minutes, then let it cool in a 
basin, and bottle off when quite cold, corking and 
sealing it closely. 

Cucvmher Catsup, — Choose large ripe cucumbers, 
peel, then remove the seeds and grate the flesh ; for 
every pint of this pur^e take half a pint of cider or 
white wine vinegar, quarter-teaspoonful of cayenne, 
one teaspoonful of salt, and two full tablespoonfuls of 
finely grated horseradish ; drain the cucumber in a 
colander, then mix it with the other ingredients, 
bottle, and seal down. (This is an American 
recipe.) 

Slice together into an earthenware pan 

twelve good cucumbers and four large onions ; add a 
good handful of salt, and let them stand until the 
liquor begins to run from them; then break them 
up small and let them stand for another twenty-four 
hours. Now strain it off, and to each quart put the 
same quantity of white (but not sweet) wine, ^Ib. of 
anchovies and a stick of horseradish; boil this all 
together for half an hour, then strain it again, and 
to each quart add ^oz. of white pepper, and the same 
of mace, and nutmeg, mixed together and pounded, 
and boil it well once more. Let it get perfectly 
cold, then bottle it as it stands, adding a small 



PICKLES. 115 

piece of ginger to each bottle as you close it down. 
(TMs is an old Eastern Counties recipe.) 

Elderberry Catsup. — Strip ripe elderberries from 
their stalks and put them in a stone jar with as 
much good vinegar as will cover them thoroughly, 
then place them in the oven when the bread is baked 
to extract the juice, and strain off whilst hot. Now 
boil this liquor with sufficient cloves, mace, pepper- 
corns and shallot to flavour it nicelv, and then add 
to it 6 to 8oz. best anchovies, for every quart of 
liquor, and boil only just enough to dissolve these. 
When cold, bottle in small bottles, and be very 
particular in fastening down. This by the way 
applies to aU catsups. 

Mushroom Catsup, — Break a peck of mushrooms 
(previously wiped with a flannel) into a large earthen- 
ware crock ; strew ^Ib. of salt over them, and leave 
them all night in a cool oven, next day strain off and 
measure the liquor, and boil it for a quarter of an 
hour. To each quart of this liquor add loz. pepper, 
^oz, allspice, |oz. ginger and two blades of mace, 
and let this all boil quickly together for half an 
hour. When cold, bottle, cork down tightly and 
seal. The big flap mushrooms do for this. 

Oyster Catsup — Open forty-eight good oysters, 
saving the liquor, wash and bone 6oz. to 8oz. of 
anchovies and add them to the oysters, with half a 
sliced lemon. Pour to this one and a half pints 
white wine, just bring it to the boil, and simmer it 
very gently for twenty minutes ; then strain through 
a muslin. Now add a teaspoonful each, of cloves, 
mace and nutmeg to this, boil it for t«OL xacaccoiMss. 

1^ 



116 PICKLES AND PRESERYES. 

more, and pour it boiling, on to loz. sliced shalot 
When cold, bottle it as it stands. 

Tomato Catsup. — Slit a peck of tomatoes, and boil 
them in an earthenware or enamelled pan, till the 
juice is extracted and the pulp dissolved. Then strain 
first through a colander, then through a hair sieve. 
Stir to this a tablespoonful each of black pepper, 
pounded cloves, and celery seed (tie these up in mus- 
lin,) and 3oz. of mustard, together with loz. each of 
salt and powdered mace: Boil this for five hours, 
stirring it now and again, at the first, but conti- 
nuously for the last hour. Pour it into a stoneware 
jar and leave it in the cellar on a stone floor for 
twelve or fourteen hours ; then take out the celery 
seed, bottle, seal, and store in a cool dark place. 

Walnut Catsup, — Crush in a mortar one hundred 
green walnuts till thoroughly broken up, then place 
them in a jar with 6oz. of cut up shalots, a head of 
garlic, two quarts of vinegar and ^Ib. of salt. Let 
all this stand for a fortnight, stirring it twice daily. 
Now strain off the liquor and put it in a pan with 
2oz. of anchovies, 2oz. of whole peppers, ^oz. cloves 
and Joz. mace, and boil it, skimming it well. When 
no more scum rises, strain it off and when cold, pour 
it off free from sediment, and cork it down closely 
in small bottles, and store in a dry place. 

Chutnibs. — These are now-a-days bought ready 
made, yet where there is a garden handy many very 
nice kinds can be home made. 

Home-made Indian Chutney. — Peel and slice down 
either apples, apricots, or quinces, according to what 
vou have, and boil them till perfectly soft in vinegar; 



?. 



PICKLES. 117 

then mix into them, mashing it all with a wooden 
spoon or pestle, stoned raisins, minced garlic, chillies, 
and bruised ginger, salt and sugar, and add a little 
more vinegar. The proportions are fib. of sliced 
apple, 2oz. or 3oz. of dried chillies, 5oz. or 6oz. of 
sugar, and the same each of raisins (weighed after 
they are stoned) and salt, a full l^oz. each of ginger 
and garlic, to each quart of vinegar, using three- 
quarters of the vinegar to boil the apples, and 
adding the remaining quarter at the last. (This 
chutney improves by keeping). 

Home-made Indian Chutney, — Take of apples, 
tomatoes, stoned raisins, and sugar, each ^Ib. ; 
bruised ginger, loz. ; onions sliced, 2oz. ; the juice 
of two lemons; a handful of salt; a tiny clove 
of garlic; a few mushrooms; some damsons (pre- 
viously cooked to a mash and then sieved) ; 
and two quarts of vinegar. Mix this all well 
together, and stand the jar containing the mix- 
ture by the side of the fire for a month (mind it does 
not boil). By this time the juice should have quite 
separated from the thick part, and the latter can be 
put up in jars, the liquid part being strained off and 
bottled for flavouring sauces, &c. (N.B. — ^The liquid 
part of any pickle should be saved in this way, as it 
is an excellent addition to many sauces). 

Tomato Chutney. — Bake some perfectly ripe to- 
matoes till tender, then rub them through a coarse 
sieve. To each pound of this pulp allow one pint of 
vinegar (more if liked), ^oz. each of garlic, salt, and 
black pepper, loz. sliced shallot, and cayenne to 
taste. Boil these altogether till the in^redie^ifea. ^^^^ 



118 PICKLES AND PRESERYES. 

all tender, then add the juice of three lemons, and 
again sieve it, adding to it as you do so, a spoonful 
of anchovy sauce (the size of the spoon is a matter 
of taste). Now boil it all again till it is of the thick- 
ness of thick cream, let it stand till cold, then bottle 
and cover down closely. Unless this sauce is properly 
cooked it will not keep ; seven or eight hours' cook- 
ing over a gentle fire is none too much. 

Tomato Chutney (Green). — Choose the tomatoes 
when full-grown, but before they have coloured, and 
slice them rather thickly into a clean, coarse, hair 
sieve (sprinkling salt over each layer of slices), and 
let them all drain for twenty-four hours. Now place 
61b. of these sliced tomatoes into an enamelled pre- 
serving pan and pour over them sufficient good 
vinegar to cover them entirely, then add 12oz. of 
loaf sugar, ^Ib. of sliced onions (do not use the 
Spanish ones, they are too watery), four or five chillies 
halved or quartered (failing chillies use an equivalent 
amount of whole black peppercorns), five or six 
cloves, and about half an inch of bruised cinnamon 
stick loosely tied up in a piece of muslin ; now stew 
it all gently in the uncovered pan, till the tomatoes 
are perfectly tender (this takes about twenty to thirty 
minutes, generally), and then put the mixture into 
jars holding about 21b., and cover down closely at 
once while hot. It is better to put up this chutney 
in small jars, even when a large quantity is made, as 
it does not keep over well once it is opened. If a 
very hot pickle is liked a little cayenne may be added 
to the mixture. (This is a Canadian recipe.) 

The abov« are sufficient to give an idea of the 



PICKLES. 119 

method of making chutnies for keeping, and as said 
before, these are condiments most people buy, as 
those made in India naturally are most generally 
popular. The Hindoo word from which our chutney 
is derived, really means only some hot condiment or 
sauce, by no means necessarily a store one, and in 
the East, fresh chutnies are in great request, to eat 
with cold meat, curries, &c. As these are pretty easy 
to make, and a somewhat uncommon relish, a few 
recipes may be advantageously given here. In some 
parts these fresh chutnies are known as " Sambals." 

Quince Sambal. — Peel and quarter some rather 
imripe quinces, and for two or three of these, take 
one onion sliced, a green chilli and some salt. Pound 
this altogether in a marble mortar, and serve. 

Cucumber Sambal — Peel and shred a cucumber, 
and mix it with finely minced chives, or thinly sliced 
onion, minced green chilli, and a little parsley. This 
can all be salted and pounded as above, or it may be 
left impounded mixed with a little oil, vinegar, salt, 
and black pepper. 

The proportions of these sambals are so much a 
matter of taste that it is not easy to state quantities 
definitely. As a general average perhaps one may 
reckon two to three tablespoonf uls of the vegetable 
that gives its name to the sambal, for a teaspoonful 
of each of the other condiments, the oil and vinegar 
when added, being kept to very modest proportions. 

Tomatoes, green mint, &c., can all be used for this, 
only remembering to remove all seeds, or stalks. 

Shrimp Chutney, — Shell some freshly cooked 
shi'imps, mince them quickly with a sharp knife^ then. 



120 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

pound them in a marble mortar with (to the pint of 
shrimps), one or two green chillies, some finely 
minced spring onions or chives, and if liked a very- 
small dust of powdered ginger, working it to a 
smooth paste with one or two spoonfuls of oil, and 
enough lemon or lime juice to acidulate it pleasantly. 
A little cayenne may be added if liked. Prawns, 
and even lobster can be used in this way. 

As a matter of fact almost every vegetable, and 
not a few fruits, can be used in the preparation of 
these sambals ; for instance, green peaches, apricots, 
plums, bananas; tomatoes, cooked or raw ; egg plant, 
cooked ; fish, fresh, smoked, or salted (either torn to 
tiny shreds or pounded), can all be used with excel- 
lent effect. Abroad these ingredients are almost 
always crushed on the stone slab with the stone 
roller that is found in every Eastern kitchen, but at 
home they can either be pounded in a marble mortar, 
or even only shredded very finely, and then well mixed 
with the rest of the addenda. 

Lastly may be given a few recipes which it is not 
altogether easy to class. 

Indian Sharp Sauce. — Pound well together ^Ib, 
each of half ripe apricots (these should be really 
mangoes) or peaches, stoned raisins, salt, sugar, and 
ginger, |^lb. each of red chillies and onions, and 2oz. 
of garhc ; when these are all well crushed, pour on to 
them three quarts of best vinegar, and a pint of fresh 
lime or lemon juice ; close up the jar well, and leave 
it for a month in the sun (or failing this in some 
warm corner of the kitchen, but the sun is best), 
shaking and stirring it up well every day. At the 



PICKLES. 121 

end of the montli strain off the liquid part and bottle 
it, and put the thick residuum, which is a particularly 
excellent chutney, into stone jars and cork down well. 
This liquid sauce is sometimes in India known as 
Quy Hi sauce. 

India Pickle. — For this pickle, all the vegetables 
used (and the greater the variety the better), should 
be steeped for five days in brine strong enough to 
tioat an egg, then they should be transferred to a 
fresh make of brine, and again steeped for five days, 
after which the vegetables must be strained from the 
brine, and left for a night on a clean cloth to dry. 
They are then put into stone jars with spiced vine- 
gar, prepared as below. Apples, green apricots, the 
thinnings of the vines, green gooseberries, unripe 
plums (stoned), cauliflower, broken up small, celery, 
cucumber (both cut into inch lengths), elder shoots, 
French beans, &c., can all be used, and can be put 
in as they come into season, only remember they

every case, before putting them into the vinegar. 
For the vinegar, boil 1| gallons of the best malt 
vinegar, with 4oz. whole mustard seed (bruised), loz. 
peppercorns, and one teaspoonf ul of cayenne, for half 
an hour; now lay into it 2oz. long pepper, 4oz. whole 
ginger (split), a handful* of dry salt, and 4oz. garlic. 

Piccallilli. — For this, boil vinegar, with (for every 
quart) loz. bruised ginger, Joz. each of white pepper- 
corns, allspice, turmeric, and curry powder, and, 
lastly, loz. shallots; when these have all boiled 
together for five minutes stir into it thoroughly loz.

smooth paste with a little warm vinegar, but do not 
let it boil again after the mustard is added. Let 
this all cool somewhat, then pour it over the pre- 
pared vegetables, and when this is aU qxdte cold 
pack it into wide-mouthed bottles, dividing the spice 
between them all. and then fastening them down. 
Care must be taken to have the contents of the jar 
well covered with vinegar; the jars should be watched 
for a little time to see if more vinegar is needed, for 
if the vegetables absorb the vinegar, more must 
be added after scalding and letting it cool. It is best 
to put this pickle up in smallish bottles, as it keeps 
better so. To prepare the vegetables, take about 
equal quantities, as far as possible, of white cabbage, 
cauliflower, capsicums, small cucumbers or gherkins, 
French beans, onions small and large, green tomatoes, 
and nasturtium seeds. Shred, or break, up the larger 
vegetables, and boil them a.ll for one minute in brine 
strong enough to float an egg, then lift them out 
and spread them on large dishes, and let them dry in 
the sun; they are then added to the hot vinegar. If, 
however, all the vegetables are not added at once 
(and this is the most usual way of making this sauce), 
remember to scald every vegetable first in the 
brine, then dry as described above, and lastly 
scald them for a minute in boiling vinegar ; then let 
them get cool before adding them to the rest. If 
this pickling is not attended to they will not keep 
themselves, and will spoil the rest of the pickle.

CHAPTEE IX. 

FLAVOUEED WINES AND VINEGARS. 

We axe nowadays so accustomed to trust to the 
grocer and Italian warehouse for our flavourings, 
essences, and herb vinegars, that we have ahnost lost 
the habit of making any of these dainties at home. 
This is a great pity, as there are many varieties, 
that, owing to the small demand for them, are 
seldom if ever to be found in shops, which yet 
impart much delicacy and flavour to the salads and 
other preparations, now coming more and more into 
use. These dainties, moreover, cost little, either in 
time, money, or labour, so are well worth trying. 

In old-fashioned houses, dainty little cruets filled 
with variously flavoured wines are still occasionally 
to be seen, and certainly a drop or two of chili, 
shallot, or cayenne wine wiU impart a flavour to 
soups, &c., which nothing else will. 

For these wines proceed thus : 

Horseradish Wine, — Infuse ^oz. of freshly grated 
horseradish in half a pint of sherry for two or three 
weeks (according to how strong you want it), then 
strain off the liquid and bottle for use. Chilli Wine^ 
shallot and garlic wine are all made in absolutely the 



FLAYOURED WINES AND YINEGARS. 125 

same way, and are generally much appreciated by 
men. Celery 8eed, again, steeped in wine makes an 
excellent flavouring; indeed, any special flavour 
liked may be prepared in this way with the utmost 
success, for anything you use for vinegar is usable 
with wine, the wine only extracting the flavour more 
fully. While on the subject of these flavourings, a 
few odds and ends may be mentioned, which, though 
having neither vinegar nor wine in their composition, 
are invaluable for flavouring. 

Essence of Capsicums. — Infuse ^oz. of absolutely 
pure cayenne (be particular on this point as the 
goodness of the essence depends entirely on it), in 
half a pint of either brandy or rectified spirits of 
wine, for two or three weeks, keeping the bottle 
tightly corked. This essence must be added with 
considerable caution for it is tremendously strong. 

" Quatre-epices.** — This flavouring mixture is much 
used abroad, and is made by pounding to a powder 
loz. each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper, 
and ^oz. of cloves ; sift this powder through muslin 
and keep in an air-tight canister. 

French Mustard. — A very good version of this is 
obtained by rubbing down the mustard flour with 
vinegar, a few drops of oil, and a very little salt. 
This variety is particularly good if any of the 
flavoured vinegars given below are used, horseradish 
or anchovy vinegar being especially excellent. A 
delicious mustard can also be made by brin^i 
a pint of white wine, a small onion, 
or five cloves, and a little salt, to ttie 
simmering it for fifteen minutes^ i 



126 PICKLES AND PRESERYES. 

strain it and mix it by degrees to a smooth paste 
with 4oz. of mustard flour. If put into a jar, and 
covered down like jam, this will keep for a long time. 
A very good keeping mustard is made by sifting 
together 2oz. mustard flour and a good saltspoonful 
of salt ; then work it gradually to a paste with half 
a gill of horseradish vinegar, and a tablespoonf ul of 
chilli vinegar. When mixed quite smooth, bottle in 
widemouthed bottles and cork down closely. 

Bavigotte Mustard, — Put half a pint of brown 
mustard seed in a basin with one or two tablespoon- 
fuls each of parsley, tarragon, chervil, and bumet, 
and a good saltspoonful each of cloves, celery seed, 
mace and shallot, and pour to these enough white 
wine vinegar to cover them ; let it all steep for twenty- 
four hours, then pound well and rub it all through a 
fine sieve, moistening it all with a little more vinegar 
to get it to the right consistency, then pack in little 
jars or wide-mouthed bottles, and cork down closely. 

Flavoured Vinegabs. — Anchovy Vinegar. — 
Steep a dozen good Gorgona anchovies (after 
washing them lightly) in a quart of pure white wine 
vinegar, with a shallot or two, or half a clove of 
garlic, for a full fortnight, then strain and bottle off. 

Basil and Burnei Vinegars. — Make these precisely 
like tarragon vinegar. The latter is most useful in 
winter, as it gives a cucumber flavour to whatever it 
is mixed with. Young syringa shoots made into a 
vinegar in the same way have precisely the same 
effect. 

Capsicum or Chilli Vinegar, — Infuse from loz. to 
2oz. of capsicums or chillies (according to the strength 



FLAYOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 127 

you wish your vinegar to be), in a quart of first-rate 
vinegar for a week or a fortnight, then strain and 
bottle off, corking and sealing it closely. It will be 
fit for use in three months. The capsicums left over 
are excellent for pickling onions. 

Celery Vinegar. — ^Wash and cleanse well some 
celery heads, and for fib. of such roots and stalks 
allow a pint of vinegar and half a teaspoonful of salt ; 
place the celery in an unglazed earthenware jar, boil 
up the vinegar and salt, and, when slightly cooled, 
pour it on to the celery, and let it all stand covered 
and corked up for three weeks ; then strain it off and 
bottle in small bottles. 

This vinegar can also be made with foz to loz. of 
celery seed to the quart of vinegar. Infuse for ten 
days or a fortnight, and finish off as before. 

Cucumher Vinegar. — Pare, seed, and slice six large 
ripe cucTimbers, and steep them for ten days in a 
quart of vinegar, and finish off as before. The vine- 
gar should be boiled up and poured on the cucumber 
when cooling. 

Gurry Vinegar. — Steep 3oz. of good curry powder 
in a quart of best vinegar for a fortnight, then strain 
or filter, and bottle off. 

Cyder Vinegar. — Dilute 61b. of sour leaven, made 
with yeast and rye flour, with enough warm water 
to liquify it ; then pour it through the bunghole into 
a large cask of cyder, stirring it well together to mix 
it aU ; let it ferment for a week, and then draw off 
at once, when you will have a strong fine cyder vine- 
gar, most useful for pickling, &c.

from loz. to IJoz. of the sun-dried flowers into 
a quart of best wMte wine vinegar, cork the 
bottle down well, and leave it in the sun for 
a fortnight; then strain and bottle oft. Elder- 
flower and MusTc Rose Vinegars are made in precisely 
the same way, but for Orange Flower Vinega/r the 
blossoms must be gathered on a dry day, be perfectly 
unbruised, and be dropped gently, fresh, into the 
vinegar. Lavender and Rosemary Vinegars are made 
by picking ^Ib. of the lavender flowers, drying them 
quickly, in the sun if possible, then infusing them^ 
closely covered, in the sun for a week, after which 
they are drawn off, filtered through blotting paper, 
and bottled off and corked securely. (By the bye, it 
is said that it is to lavender vinegar, more used in old 
days in cookery than in the present, that aspic jelly 
owes its name, having been originally flavoured with 
it, from the old name " espic " for lavender.) 

Cowslip Vinegar, — Put a quart of cowslip flowers 
(only the pips as for cowslip wine) into a bottle with 
three or four sprays of sweetbriar tips (only the 
young shoots should be used) to each pint of vinegar, 
and pour on to this three pints of best white wine 
vinegar. Cover down closely and iufuse for fully 
ten days ; then strain and bottle. Very good with- 
out the sweetbriar if you cannot get that. This is 
an American recipe, being much used in compound- 
ing many American drinks. Primrose Vinegar is 
made in the same way, but without the sweetbriar. 

Nasturtium Vinegar. — ^Put as many nasturtium 
flowers as you can in a wide-mouthed quart bottle, 
with a, little ginger, mace, long pepper, and a chilli or 



FLAVOURED WINES AND YINEGARS. 129 

two (or Joz. cayenne), and a few cloves. Fill up with 
best malt vinegar, and keep the bottle shaken occa- 
sionally for two or three days, then cork down tightly 
and seal up. This should certainly be kept for two 
or three months, but the longer it is kept the better. 
When wanted for use, strain off through muslin, 
after well shaking up the bottle. Always put back 
into the bottle the thick leafy part that escapes in the 
straining. The same flowers will bear the addition 
of more vinegar twice more. (I have found it better 
to use smaller bottles, as then each will fill up the 
cruet comfortably.) 

Rose Vinegar, — Put an ounce of rose leaves in a 
pint of best white wine vinegar, with a root or so of 
Florence lily, and let it all infuse till the liquid is 
strongly flavoured, then strain off and bottle. (For 
salads, and also abroad used for toilette purposes.) 

Violet Vinegar (German). — Pick wood violets (as 
they have the strongest perfume) in the spring, 
remove the stems, and put the flowers into bottles, 
shaking them down to make them lie closely, and 
then pour to them as much white wine vinegar as 
thev will take, then cork and set the bottles in the 
sun for three or four weeks. Now strain off. the 
vinegar, and bottle and cork it down closely. 

Fruit Vinegars. — Black Currant Vinegar. — 
Put in a preserving pan a quart of good ripe 
black currants, with a pint of the young currant 
leaves, and stir them over the fire with a new 
wooden spoon till the currants begin to boil, then 
turn it all into the jelly bag, and strain it all 
through, squeezing out every drop of juice ^wx.

can ; return this juice to the pan with l|lb. pure cane 
sugar to each quart of juice, stir it well till the sugar 
melts, then skim it very carefully, putting the Bkim- 
mings on a sieve, and return the juice that strains 
through to the preserving pan ; let it stand till cold, 
then for each quart of this syrup allow one and a half 
pints of best white wine vinegar, adding, if it is to 
keep, from half to a pint of plain spirit to each gal- 
lon of the vinegar. Red currant vinegar is made in 
precisely the same way. 

Gooseberry Vinegar. — Choose the hairy goose- 
berries, either red or green, wlien full ripe. Break 
down the fruit with a wooden pestle, and allow lib. 
of crushed cane loaf sugar to each 21b. of fruit. Let 
it all stand for two hours, then turn it all into the 
preserving pan and scald till the juice runs free. 
Now run it through a jelly bag wrung out of warm 
vinegar, and to this juice allow a gill of plain spirit 
or brandy to each quart of juice, and then mix 
with it all an equal quantity of best white wine 
vinegar. 

Mulberry Vinegar. — Put into an unglazed earthen- 
ware pan 61b. of ripe, sound mulberries, and pour 
over them enough good vinegar to cover them; let 
them soak, covered, for twenty-four hours, then crush 
them with a clean wooden spoon, and again cover 
them with a cloth for another twenty-four hours; 
again bruise them, mixing them well, and add in 
more vinegar till a gallon has been used altogether. 
When this has stood for a week (mind it is well stir- 
red up every day), strain off the liquid, and to each 
pint add lib. of cane loaf sugar, and boil it all up 



FLAYOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 131 

well for five mimites, sldmining it very carefully. 
Then bottle off, like raspberry vinegar. 

Baspherry Vinegar. — Put three gallons of ripe and 
well coloured raspberries into a large unglazed earth- 
enware jar, and pour over them a gallon of white 
wine vinegar. Let it all stand for three or four days, 
lightly covered with paper to keep out the dust, then 
strain it off into a clean basin through a jelly bag 
or a fine and well scalded horsehair sieve. The juice 
should run clear and bright. Now measure it, and 
for each pint allow lib. of cane loaf sugar, and stir it 
over the fire with a clean wooden, or a silver spoon, 
till the sugar is quite dissolved, and skim it very 
carefully. Let it boil for about half an hour, then 
stir it till cool, when you add from half to a pint of 
spirit for each quart of liquid, then bottle off and 
cork down closely, Mind not to use anything iron 
or tin in making this as its beauty depends upon its 
perfect colour. Another simpler way (but one that 
does not keep so well) is to fill a large 71b. or 81b. 
jam jar with raspberries, and pour over them suffi- 
cient vinegar to cover them well and fill the jar, and 
let it all stand for nine days, stirring it daily ; then 
strain it off, add 12oz. of cane loaf sugar to each pint 
of juice, and boil together till no more scimi will rise, 
and then bottle off carefully. 

Strawberry Vinegar. — Gather the fruit when at the 
point of perfection, and use at once. Remove the 
stalks, weigh the fruit and put it into wide-mouthed 
glass bottles, pouring on to it a quart of best white 
wine vinegar to every pound of fruit. Cover the jars 
closely and let it stand for three days, then dj^iss. 'c^

the liquid and pour it upon some more fresh fruit 
Again let this stand for three days, and again strain 
off, adding fresh fruit yet a third time. After this 
has stood for three days drain off the juice through 
a jelly bag wrung out of warm vinegar, measure it 
all, and stir it till the broken-up loaf sugar (added 
in the proportion of lib. to each pint of liquid) is 
almost dissolved, then put it aU on the fire (which 
must be very clear for this), and let it boil gently for 
five minutes. Now pour it off, let it stand for ten or 
twelve minutes, then skim thoroughly and bottle off. 
(A simpler form is made by following the second re- 
(Hpe for raspberry vinegar). 

Garlic Vinegar. — ^Bruise loz. of garlic lightly with 
twelve cloves and a roughly broken-up nutmeg, and 
pour on to it a gallon of white wine vinegar, or at all 
events good colourless vinegar. Let it all steep for a 
month, then pour off and bottle for use. You can pour 
fresh vinegar on to the garlic, and let it steep for 
three months when you will get a good but coarser 
vinegar, though it is very useful in cookery; while 
the more delicate kind made with the white vinegar 
can be kept for salads, &c. 

Honey Vinegar. — Dissolve 41b. of really good pure 
honey in a gallon of water, then pour it all into 
a small cask, leaving the bunghole open though 
covered with a piece of muslin to keep out dust, &c. 
Set it in a warm place, or in the hottest sunshine, for 
five or six weeks, by which time it should be ready 
for use. 

Horseradish Vinegar. — Put into an imglazed jar 
Boz. freshly grated horseradish, loz. minced shallot, 



FLAVOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 133 

two teaspoonfuls of black pepper and one of cay- 
enne ; pour on to this a quart of boiling vinegar, and 
let it all infuse closely covered for three or four 
days, then strain off, bottle and seal up. Another 
way is to put into a wide-necked dry bottle, 3oz. salt, 
2joz. freshly grated horseradish, ^oz. bruised ginger, 
a clove of garlic, and either four chillies or a good 
pinch of cayenne ; mix this all well with half a pint 
of cold boiled vinegar, then pour on to it two and a 
half pints of vinegar previously brought to the boil, 
then allowed to cool a little before pouring it into 
the bottle. Cover this all down tightly, let it stand 
for thirty-six hours in a warm place, then strain 
and bottle off into little bottles, with a chilli in 
each. Seal down closely when cold. (N.B. — Most 
delicious mustards for eating with cold meat can be 
made by mixing the mustard flour with either of 
these horseradish, or indeed any of the flavoured, 
vinegars). 

Mint Vinegar. — Make this precisely like tarragon 
vinegar. 

Bavigotte Vinegar. — In a pint of French wine 
vinegar, infuse a couple of tablespoonfuls each of 
minced garden- cress and tarragon, one of minced 
chives, a small clove of garhc (if liked) or a minced 
shallot, and three chillies. Let it stand till fully 
flavoured, then strain and bottle off as before. 

Shallot Vinegar. — Peel and mince 4oz. of fully, but 
not over, ripe shallots (or it will give a bitter flavour 
to the vinegar), put them into a bottle and cover with 
a quart of best vinegar, and infuse for ten days, 
shaking the bottle well daily ; then strain and €iisst

ofE the yinegar, bottle in small bottles, and store 
tightly corked and sealed. 

Spiced Vinegar. — (This can be used at once for 
pickling any vegetables, or if bottled off cold like the 
other flavouring vinegars it makes an excellent addi- 
tion to salads, &c.) Bruise well 2oz. black whole 
peppers, loz. each of ginger and salt and ^oz. of 
allspice, then mix this in a bottle with a quart of 
good vinegar (whether malt or wine vin^ar does not 
matter, but the quality must be first rate), adding if 
you like loz. of chopped shallot, an atom of garlic, 
and some chillies, or a little cayenne (this of course 
makes it pretty hot). Tie the bottle over with blad- 
der wetted with vinegar, and leave it in a warm place 
for a few days ; then stand the bottle in the bain- 
marie, keep the water round it at simmering 
point for one or two hours, and bottle off in the 
usual way. If to be used for pickling purposes, boil 
up the vinegar with all the condiments mentioned, to 
which, if liked, a bay leaf and a good bouquet may 
be added ; then let it cool a little, and pour it on to 
the things to be pickled. 

Tarragon Vinegar. — Pick young tarragon shoots, 
and dry them in the sun for a day or two, then 
infuse them in good vinegar for a fortnight, after 
which you strain and bottle off the vinegar as before. 
You can let the tarragon infuse longer if you like, 
but that is a matter of taste; or you can pour a 
second supply of vinegar over the tarragon, allowing 
it to infuse for a month or so, when it will vield a 
very good vinegar for cooking purposes, though not 
as delicate as the first, which answers for salads, <fcc. 



FLAYOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 135 

You simply put the tarragon points into the bottle 
not too tightly, and fill up with the vinegar. 

White Wine Vinegar (French), — Have ready a 
small barrel of good, colourless vinegar (cyder vine- 
gar is much used for this), and take three or four 
quarts (according to the size of the barrel) from 
it, replacing these by an equal amount of sound, 
clear, light French wine; then close up the bung- 
hole, and leave the barrel in a warm, even tempera- 
ture for a month, when the same quantity should be 
again drawn off and replaced with wine, and again 
left to stand. Treated thus, a stock cask will last 
for a long time, good and clear, and without the 
least deposit. 

Formerly vinegar was always made from a 
" mother," as it was called, i, e. a sort of fungus, 
sometimes also called the " vinegar plant '* — these can 
be still bought in the country, and also, I believe, in 
Covent Gurden Market. For this melt ^Ib. of coarse 
brown sugar and ^Ib. of treacle in about two gallons 
of water, and let it all boil up well, then stir it well, 
put it into a cask or large jar, and when tepid place 
the vinegar plant in it. Let it stand for two or three 
months at least, in a warm place, then draw off the 
liquor, boil up, strain, and bottle for use. This vine- 
gar after bottling should be always kept in a cool 
place. Remember the "mother,* being in reality 
nothing but a fungus, requires moisture, heat, and 
darkness ; if left dry it dies. A young plant forms 
on the old one, and if scaled off carefully can be 
used to make more vinegar. This vinegar, howevei-, 
is rather tasteless. One thing must be remembered^ 



136 PIGKLES AND PRESERVES. 

and that is when making wine vinegar, sound 
wine must be used ; corked, or acid wine will result 
in failure, for the stronger and better the wine (in 
reason), the better will be the vinegar. Unfortu- 
nately, it is very difficult to disabuse the minds of 
would-be thrifty housekeepers of the notion that 
wine, when so sour and spoilt as to be manifestly 
unfit for drinking, is therefore just right for use in 
cookery, or for vinegar. 

A very good rough and ready method of dis- 
charging the colour from good vinegar for pickle- 
making, is to stir together animal charcoal 
(obtainable at the chemist's), and the very best 
vinegar, let it stand for a few days, then strain off 
the clear liquid. The proportions are IJoz. of the 
charcoal to each quart of vinegar. Lastly, there is 
an old-fashioned recipe for dried vinegar halls, in 
which our grandmothers had great faith. Gather 
blackberries when just half ripe, dry them, and then 
pound to a powi'er; mix this to a stiff paste with a 
little very strong white vinegar. Make into balls 
the size of nuts, dry well, and keep in air-tight 
boxes. When wanted, dissolve one of these balls in 
either light white wine, or a little stale beer, and 
use. I have never tried this, but found it in an old 
and usually most trustworthy book. 

The two following are not strictly culinary, but 
being " vinegars " are given here : 

Toilet Vinegar, — Add 2oz. dried rose-leaves and 

40 drops attar of roses to 5oz. rectified spirits of 

wine and one pint dilute acetic acid. Stand in a 

closed vessel for fourteen days, shaking or stirring it 



FLAVOURED WINES AND VINEGARS. 137 

occasionally. Or, steep |oz. benzoin for eight days 
in 2oz. rectified spirits of wine, then strain and put 
the tincture aside. Meanwhile, pour half a pint of 
white vinegar on the benzoin, let it steep for six days, 
then strain and add to the tincture, bottling and 
corking it well. 

** Thieves* Vinegar** — ^Put into a jar a handful 
each of rosemary, lavender, rue, sage, wormwood, 
and mint, and pour on to it a gallon of strong clear 
vinegar, cover close and leave for four days near the 
fire ; then strain and add to the liquid an ounce of 
powdered camphor gum, bottle and keep it tightly 
corked. Excellent for sickroom use. 

This vinegar is said to derive its name from a 
legend that, through the great plague in Marseilles 
during the seventeenth century, robbers, protected by 
it, entered and robbed sickrooms with impunity. 
They are said to have bought their lives by giving up 
the secret of this vinegar, hitherto imknown. 

Sjnced Vinegar. — Boil up well together three pints 
of good vinegar (brown malt or white wine, according 
to the use you intend making of it), with loz. each 
of cloves, long or whole peppers, allspice, and ginger, 
then let it cool, and use when cold. 

This is excellent for any kind of pickles, for which 
specially spiced vinegar is not given. Vinegar should 
always be just boiled up, either with or without spice, 
and tVien allowed to cool perfectly before it is added 
to any pickle. Some housekeepers use raw vinegar, 
but this never gives the same mellow flavour as is 
obtained by the above process. 



CHAPTEE X. 

MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 

Dwellers in the country might easily add to their 
larder resources and the variety of their menus, if 
they were to try home curing more extensively than 
is mostly done in England, while of the economy of 
this plan it is hardly necessary to speak. In many 
places fresh pork is actually dear at ^d, a pound, yet 
a little time and trouble is all that is needed to turn 
this pork into the equivalent of bacon sold generally 
at 10(£., or ham that it would be difficult to get for a 
penny or so more than this price for the same weight. 
Then again both beef and mutton lend themselves 
admirably to pickling and curing, whilst few things 
equal a properly home-cured ox tongue ; moreover, 
salmon, herring, mackerel, &c., can all be prepared at 
home in various ways. 

To start with pork, which is the most generally 
home-cured meat. A pig may be fattened at any 
time between the ages of nine months and two years, 
and the fattening process usually takes from three 
to six months. The time of curing must depend on 
circumstances — if the pig is home-killed, either by 
the local butcher or someone on the premises, the 



MEAT, &o., TO CURE. 139 

meat Bhould be cured at once; but if the meat is 
bought in the shape of pork it should be hung long 
enough to ensure its being tender, i, e, to give the 
time for the death stiffness (or rigor mortis) to pass 
off. If the pig is home-killed be sure and save all 
the blood while the animal is still warm, lettinoj it 
run into a bowl, and stirring it all the time with a 
wooden spoon to prevent its coagulating, when it 
would be utterly useless. The great thing in pig- 
killing is to make the blood run freely, if not it 
disperses internally and spoils the meat. Having 
taken away all the blood, scald the carcase well to 
facilitate the removal of the bristles, which is done 
by scraping the body with a blunt knife. Imme- 
diately this is accomplished hang the carcase up by 
the hind legs and slit it down the front, to allow of 
the removal of the intestines, &c. The gall must be 
carefully removed, and every vestige of blood any- 
where about the flesh wiped off most punctiliously. 
It does not do to wash the flesh of pork too much, as 
it would only soften, and so spoil, the meat. Set the 
parts removed aside in clean cold water to soak, as 
these must be thoroughly well washed and rinsed 
before use. When the carcase is perfectly cool it 
may be cut up. As regards this cutting up a good 
deal depends on the use to which the meat is to be 
put. The parts generally used fresh are the loin, 
either whole or in the shape of chops, the best end of 
the neck, used for cutlets; and the leg, often 
served fresh and roasted. Otherwise, the hind 
legs are reserved for curing hams, the front ones 
being cured as "hands" or "corner cushions" of

pork. The head is usually divided up into the 
two cheeks, the rest of the head, with the tongue, 
being utilized for brawn. Of course the cutting 
up of the pig naturally depends on how you are 
going to use it. If it is going to be cured entirely, 
you would cut off the hind and fore legs as shown 
in the diagram, the sides thus left being known 
as the " flitches," see Fig. 1.

Where, however, the pig has a double duty to pay, 
t.e., to furnish both salted and fresh joints. Fig. 2 
gives the method of dividing the carcase. 

In many cases half the pig is devoted to the 
pickling tub, the other half being reserved for fresh 
use. Besides these joints there is also the fat to be 
considered. That which lies round the kidneys is the 
most delicate, and is used for various purposes in 
cookery. In England it is known to country folk as 
the '*flead," and in France as "panne." Most de- 
licious lard is prepared from this fat, if not wanted 
for the kitchen ; in France it is generally kept for 
the preparation of various delicate kinds of force-

meat and for some sorts of sausages ; ia England it

skinning the flead and then slicing it into the flour, 
using from ^Ib. to fib. of flead to lib of flour ; the 
mixture is then made into a dough as for pastry, with 
salt and a little water, then beaten with a rolling-pin, 
rolled out, cut into round cakes and baked in a sharp 
oven. These cakes can be served plain (they rise 
beautifully, and are very flakey) or dusted with sugar 
and a few washed and diied currants. The rest of 
the fat is rendered down for lard, which is never so 
good as when home-made. 

Lard, to melt, — Strip off the skin from the inside 
fat of a fresh-killed pig, slice it down very thinly 
into a new or well scalded jar, set either in the bain- 
marie, or in a pan three parts full of boiling water, 
and let it all simmer till thoroughly dissolved ; now 
strain it into small stone jars, or a deep bowl, and 
leave it till cold, when you tie it over with some of 
the skin taken from the lard, or well washed and 
dried bladder. The last drainings of the fat should 
be kept separate as it will not be so good as the first. 
If flead is to be kept, rub it well with fine salt di- 
rectly it is taken from the pig, and leave it in this 
for two days, then drain well, and lay it in strong 
brine, changing this occasionally. When to be used 
lay this fat into cold fresh water for two or three 
hours, then wipe it perfectly dry, and it can be used 
as if fresh. 

The process of curing requires great care and at- 
tention; as said before, the best times are either 
when the pork is just killed, or when it has been 
hung long enough to become tender. This hanging 
must in great measure depend on the weather (it 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 143 

must be remembered that nothing can be cured satis* 
factorilj in hot, or even warm weather ; abroad, pork 
is a forbidden food after May, tmtil winter returns) ; 
from three days to a week is the usual time in win- 
ter, while if it is absolutely necessary to cure in 
warmer times, one to two days is the outside limit of 
what can be allowed, and then the meat mvM lie 
hung in a cool, dark place. A point that cannot 
be too strongly impressed on those responsible for 
curing meat, is the absolute necessity of removing all 
blood, and any pipes or kernels left in the meat; 
these if left in, are pretty certain to caui4e trouble b^ 
spoiling the meat. The next thing to consider i»> 
the salting trough; unglazed stoneware is excellent 
for small things, such as tongueft, &c., }>ut iM 
too heavy and unwieldy where large joints such as 
flitches, &c., are concerned. About as nice a thing as 
any is a wooden trough, which any local r^ooper would 
make. This should be about 2ft. deep, and rather 
wider at the bottom than at the t<^>p, say 16in. or 18in. 
at the top, and 20in. to 22in. at the bottom, insidt; 
measure in both cases. This trough should jinrferabl y 
stand on a frame of some kind, and have a hole at 
the bottom to facilitate the removal of the extra 
pickle, or the washing out of the trough. The 
necessity for the strictest cleanlinf;ss must It^: inn'iHUn] 
on, and the trough should be thoroughly M/.Tuhlxrd 
and scoured after use, and even Ijefore nm; again, if 
by any chance it has l^een left out of use for some 
time. All pickling utensils should Ije thoroughly 
scrubbed and scalded out after use, Ije left Uy dry in

lU PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

place. It will be found a great addition to the 
flarour if before use the trough is thoroughly 
scalded out with boiling water, in which you haye 
boiled up some bay leaves and juniper berries. It is 
a mistake, especially in these days when salt is so 
cheap, to use the same brine in succession for different 
things, but at the same time if the trough is suffi- 
ciently large, it is a good plan to salt two or three 
things together, as this ensures a good supply of 
pickle ; and remember, once the articles are put into 
brine they should be kept well covered, It is for 
this reason that the peculiar shape of trough is 
advised, as this should be covered with a fitting lid, 
which, as the pickled meat shrinks, can be weighted 
and allowed to sink, so as to keep the meat well 
under the pickle. As a general rule it is best to rub 
the meat first with from one-third to half the quantity 
of salt, then leave it for a day or two, and then rub in 
the rest (this is for more or less dry curing) ; this 
ensures the salt being well worked into the meat, a 
point on which the keeping of the bacon greatly 
depends. It must be remembered that the salt should 
be especially carefully rubbed into any place that 
folds over, the shank ends and joints of the bone, 
&c. An excellent pickle for general use is made by 
boiling together 6oz. of salt, 4oz. of sugar, and ^oz. 
of saltpetre to each quart of water, skimming it 
well, and then pouring it when cool on to the meat 
to be pickled; which should have been previously 
well rubbed with salt, and allowed to stand for 
twenty-four hours, when it must be well wiped to 
free it from any stale salt, before putting it into the 



MEAT, &c., TO CURB. 145 

pickle. Of course, the quantities maj be increased 
to any amount, only being careful to keep the pro- 
portions right. Bay salt, from being naturally dried 
by the action of the sun, is usually held to be 
sweeter for pickling than the chemically prepared 
ordinary salt. Always be careful not to overdo the 
saltpetre in any recipe, as though it colours, it also 
hardens the meat. 

Besides sugar, salt (common and bay), and salt- 
petre, there are other things that may be added to 
vary the flavour of the pickle used, such as juniper 
berries, bay leaves, herbs, spice, &c., which will, how- 
ever, be mentioned when giving particular recipes; 
but remember that when using any or all of these, 
unless otherwise directed, the best plan is to make a 
fairly strong infusion of the ingredients in a little 
boiling water, and then add this to the pickle when 
both are cool. To proceed, however, with general 
directions. As soon as the meat is cured it should be 
carefully wiped dry with a clean cloth, and then 
covered thickly with coarse bran or sawdust, which 
should have been previously dried for a little in the 
oven. The pieces can then be hung up in some cool, 
dry and shady place, being careful that each piece 
hangs free, touching nothing on any side. If to be 
smoked, they are either hung in the kitchen chimney 
over a wood, or if possible, a furze fire, a little saw- 
dust being added to this now and again. If a fairly 
steady fire is kept up, large pieces like flitches, &c., 
will take about a month, but they can hang longer, if 
liked. Hams to be smoked, are better if sewn up in 
coarse packing sheet. Where there is no chiias^fi^

convenient, a roi^h and ready plan is to make a

or juniper wood, hang the ham to be smoked to the

inside of the («p of a ht^ahead and then turn the 
whole over the fire, keeping in the smoke till the 
bam is smoked. Where, however, the curing of 



MEAT, Ac, TO CURB. 147 

bacon, liam, &c., is mucli practised, it is easy enough 
to provide oneself at a relatively small cost, with a 
most convenient little smoking apparatus of which 
we give an illustration. (Fig. 3.) This smoking 
cupboard is one approved by M. Gk)uffe, and could 
easily be copied by any local workman. It can, of 
course, be made to any scale, but a very convenient 
size for the use of a smaU household is 4ft. 6in. high, 
and 3ft. deep, and wide ; this box should be lined 
with sheet iron throughout, and be fitted with iron 
rods across, by which the articles to be smoked can 
be hung from hooks. The door should be carefully 
fitted, as it must close hermetically to ensure the 
keeping in of the smoke. The whole box should be 
raised about 20in. from the ground, on either wooden 
or iron legs ; an iron pan or pot about 5in. deep, 
and pierced with holes, raised on a trivet, should be 
placed under the box to contain the fuel ; the smoke 
from this is conveyed into the smoking cupboard by 
means of a small flue or pipe about 2^in. in diameter, 
fitted to the metal cover of the fuel pot as shown in the 
illustration. This flue is slipped through a hole in 
the bottom of the cupboard cut to fit it exactly, so as 
not to waste the smoke. Another similar flue is fit- 
ted to the top of the cupboard, to cany ofE the smoke 
into the open air, or into a chimney. The method of 
using this cupboard is as follows : put into the fire- 
pot a layer of charcoal embers (braise), and over this 
a layer of oak, elm, or other hard wood sawdust 
and wood shavings, to about one and a half inches in 
depth, and on this lay three or four bay leaves, a few 
sprays of thyme, and eighteen or twenty -^j^issss^Bt 



148 PIOKLES AND PRESERVES. 

berries. Leave the meat in the cupboard for seven 
to eight days, earefnUy making np the fire, and re- 
nevdng the aromatics every two days. In preparing 
a fire for smoking, use shavings and logs of oak, 
beech, ehn, <&c., and when these are well alight cover 
them with a thick layer of tan or oak bark, and on 
this bum periodicaUy dry herbs, berries, and brown 
sugar. Being so closely covered in, this fire-pot be- 
comes essentially a slow combustion stove, and main- 
tains a steady even fire^ This sized cupboard will 
accommodate two hams or so comfortably. Where 
space is not a great consideration, as in the country, 
it is very convenient to give up some small room for 
the purpose of a drying chamber. Any airy place 
free from damp, and facing north, will answer for 
this, only remember to have all the windows fitted 
with very close wire gauze to keep out the flies. Of 
course this is not a sine qud non, but it is an im- 
mense convenience, as the pork can be hung here 
either before or after smoking as may be needed ; 
moreover, such a room allows of making various 
kinds of excellent sausages seldom seen in England. 
Lastly, and before going on to individual recipes, 
it may be well to say a few words re sausage making. 
For these very little preparation is needed beyond 
well washed and dried bladders or skins, and a 
thoroughly efficient mincer in first-rate condition; for 
if not kept in this state the chopping blades will 
crush and pound the meat rather than finely mince 
it, in which case the sausages will be stodgy. Of 
sausages there are several kinds. 1. Those to be 
eaten fresh. 2. Those which are lightly smoked and 



MEAT, &c., TO CURB. 149 

usually cooked by boiling, after a short period of 
keeping. 3. Those smoked for a much longer time, 
and either boiled and eaten cold, or in some cases, 
after prolonged smoking, sliced very thinly and 
served without cooking, as hora (Tceuvre, 

Flitch, to Cure (Old English mode), — Remove all 
the fat from the inside of a good flitch, and lay it on 
a board or trestle to let all the blood run ofE. (A 
curing place should always be kept cool and 
shady like a dairy.) Rub it very thoroughly on both 
sides with good salt, bay salt for choice, and leave it 
for a day in this. Now mix together lib. of fresh bay 
salt, l|oz. saltpetre, 21b. of coarse sugar, and 3^1b. of 
common salt. Lay the flitch in the trough, skin 
downwards, and rub the flesh very thoroughly with 
the mixture just given, being careful to rub it 
thoroughly well in, all over. Leave it in this for a 
fortnight, basting it every day with its own pickle, 
carefully examining it daily to see that the thick and 
folded parts are all right, and being careful at once to 
remove any sign of mould or clamminess. After this 
smoke it well, and then hang it in a dry, cool place. 
Oversmoking, or the hanging of the bacon when 
ready in either a hot kitchen or a sunny keeping- 
place is pretty safe to bring on rust. 

Rub each flitch well with common salt, 

leave it for twenty-four hours, then rub it off. Have 
ready a mixture made by pounding very finely and 
sifting, l^lb. brown sugar, 2 Jib. common salt, fib. 
bay salt, 4oz. saltpetre, and one cake sal prunella. 
Spread this over the flitches, and turn and rub them 
daily for a month. Hang up to dr^, Qjr^-ssiSiisjJi'?^

mixture with l^lb. each of brown sugar and bay salt, 
41b. common salt, and 4oz. saltpetre. Use as in the 
preceding recipe, then hang for a day or two, and 
smoke for a week. 

Flitch, to Cure (Yorkshire fashion), — ^Let the pork 
hang for twelve hours after cutting up ; then for each 
stone of pork allow lib. salt, loz. saltpetre, and Joz. 
coarse sugar. Rub the meat well first with the sugar 
and saltpetre, carefully removing any blood, &c., and 
then rub it well with the salt, which should have 
previously been slightly warmed before the fire, using 
only a part to begin with, and adding more as the 
first dissolves, or is absorbed. The meat should be 
laid on a clean stone or brick floor, and will take 
about a fortnight to three weeks to cure, according 
to the weather, which must be neither a severe frost 
nor damp when the curing is beguu. When cured, 
hang the flitches in a cool, dry room, in a good 
draught, and leave them there till they are dry and 
the salt has crystallised on the surface. The bacon 
can then be stored in a chest on clean straw, a thick 
layer of this being placed above and below the flitch. 
For this method of curing allow lib. of salt, loz. of 
saltpetre, and Joz. of coarse sugar to each stone of 
pork. These recipes give a good idea of the method 
of preparing bacon flitches, but these are not done 
conveniently with small curing facilities; and for 
private families the curing of hams, tongues, <fcc., 
are the most practical. Before, however, proceeding to 
these, the method of pickling pork, and also the pre- 
paration of French or larding bacon, may be given. 

J^ork, to Fickle. — Bone the pork, and cut it into 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 151 

neat pieces, to fit tlie size of the pickling pan (the 
belly or thin flank is best for this purpose). Rub 
the pork well with salt, put a layer of salt in the 
trough, then lay in the pork, sprinkling each piece 
well with salt as you lay it in, till you have alternate 
layers of pork and salt; let them lie in this well 
packed in with salt all round for two or three days, 
and then sprinkle all over the top a mixture made 
with 61b. coarse brown sugar, lib. bay salt, 6oz. salt- 
petre, and about 41b. of common salt. As soon as the 
salt begins to " give " or melt, rub these ingredients 
well in, and turn the pieces frequently, keeping them 
all well covered with brine. As the salt melts strew 
more on, then throw a coarse clean cloth over the 
tub, and on this put a board, and weight this so that 
it keeps the pork well under the brine. If the trough 
is kept well covered with a two or three times folded 
flannel, a little more salt being added now and again, 
it will keep to the very last. 

Another way of pickling pork is to make a brine 
of water and bay salt sufficiently strong to float an 
egg, and after it has been boiled, skimmed (till no 
more scum rises), and allowed to cool, lay the pick- 
ling pork in this. 

" PetU 8ale,^* or French Larding Bacon, — Choose 
the fattest part of the pork (for this should have 
little or no lean with it), and rub this well with salt, 
which should have been previously pounded and 
sifted ; stack the layers of this fat bacon in a shallow 
trough or tray, and leave it in a cool but not damp 
cellar; add more salt all round the bacon as the 
first dissolves, and keep it pressed domtL'^^^^'^^isRi^- 



152 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

covered board, weighted rather heavily. Let it 
remain thus for six weeks, then hang in a dry airy 
room. This is the ordinary way, but for more deli- 
cate use here is the French mode, which, however, 
only keeps a week at the most. For this boil together 
common salt, bay salt, brown sugar, and water in the 
proportions of 21b. of salt, 4oz. brown sugar, and 2oz. 
bay salt to each gallon of water, stirring this fre- 
quently together ; then when the salt, <fec., is dissolved 
and the mixture has cooled, add an infusion of any 
spice or herbs to taste, as described above, and pour 
it over the pork, which should have been previously 
lightly rubbed with salt. This is ready for use in 
three days. 

Hams, to Pickle. — To each ham, if large, allow lib. 
bay salt, l^oz. saltpetre, and loz. black pepper, and 
pound and mix all these well together. Rub the ham 
very hard with this mixture, and let it lie in it for 
four days, taming and rubbing it daily ; then pour 
over it 1 jlb. of treacle, and let it stand for a month, 
turning, basting, and rubbing it daily. Now lift it 
out, soak for twenty-four hours, then dry it carefully, 
sew it up in coarse cloth and hang it up to dry. 
This kind of ham requires no soaking before use. 
This is an excellent recipe, but for a hot or damp 
climate the following is better: lib. salt, lib. very 
dark sugar, 2oz. bay salt, l^oz. of saltpetre, and a 
gill each of ale and vinegar, with a little pepper. 
Keep it for a month or six weeks in pickle. These 
are both well-tested family recipes. 

(a la Tide). — Rub the hams well with 

^alt and leave them to drain for three days. Throw 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 153 

this brine away, and liave ready a fresh, one made 
by mixing together for each 141b. ham, l^^oz. 
saltpetre, 6oz. to 7oz. coarse salt, Jib. coarse sugar ; 
lay the hams in the trough skin downwards, and rub 
them thoroughly with this mixture, being sure every 
part gets its share ; after three days of this treatment, 
pour over each ham a pint of vinegar, and keep it 
turned, basted, and well rubbed daily for a month ; 
then smoke them for a month, hanging them rather 
high in the chimney lest the fat shoidd melt, which 
it is apt to do when pickled in this way. (It may be 
observed that a flitch of bacon may be pickled by 
this recipe, and is particularly good, and keeps a 
long time, as the vinegar preserves it.) Hams pickled 
in this way are better baked than boiled, and at any 
rate must be cooked very gently and not overdone. 
The pork must be of first-rate quality. 

Hams, to Pickle (Italian fashion), — Mix together 
two quarts of Barolo wine (a rough red vin du jpays, of 
the Burgundian type), three quarts cold water, 61b. 
coarse salt, nearly lib. bay salt, and about 6oz. salt- 
petre. Dissolve this aU well, and when cool add to 
it an aromatic infusion as described above ; then use 
it as in the preceding recipes. In Westphalia they 
boil together six quarts of water, 71b. of salt, nearly 
21b. of sugar, lOoz. saltpetre, and 4oz. aromatic 
herbs, tied up in a piece of muslin ; when cold, 
strain and use. For Bayonne hams, make a pickle 
with two quarts good sound red French wine, three 
quarts cold water, 3^1b. of common salt, lOoz. bay 
salt, 5oz. saltpetre, and an infusion of rosemary, 
sage, and lavender. 



154 PICKLES AKD PRESEEVES. 

HamSy to Pickle (old Yorkshire way). — Rub two or 
three hams well with a mixture of half a peck of salt, 
^oz. sal prunella, 2oz. saltpetre, and 41b. coarse sugar. 
Then lay them in a tub, covering them with the rest 
of the mixture. Let them lie in this for three davs, 
then take them out and let them hang for twenty- 
four hours at least. Meantime prepare a pickle with 
enough water to cover the hams thoroughly, and suffi- 
cient salt to float an- egg ; boil, skim, and strain this, 
and steep the hams in this when cool, for a fortnight. 

Pig's cheeks are prepared in just the same way 
as either bacon or ham. The rest of the head, 
with the tongue and the pettitoes, are salted for a 
few days, then used for brawn. 

Ox Tongues, to Pickle. — ^Pound together very finely 
4oz. common salt, 3oz. bay salt, |oz. of saltpetre, 
and the same of sal prunella, with 4oz. coarse 
sugar ; then rub this mixture well into the tongue, 
rubbing and turning this daily for three weeks. It 
is best to do two or three tongues together. (This 
also is a well tried old family recipe.) Tongues need 
care in preparing them for the pickling tub; they 
must be freed from all root, gristle, and fat ; and all 
the slimy sticky substance often found adhering to 
them must be carefully wiped off with a clean cloth ; 
if left on this would spoil the pickle used. Another 
way of preparing these is thus : make a pickle by 
boiling together 6oz. salt, 4oz. sugar, and a short 
J^oz. of saltpetre, to each quart of water ; skim this 
well till no more scum rises, then strain it, and pour 
it when cool over the trimmed tongues, which should 
have been previously lightly rubbed all over with salt. 



CHAPTEE XI. 

MEAT, &c., TO GXTKE— (Continued). 

After considering the most usual forms of cured 
meat, sausages appear the next things to claim one's 
attention. These are of many kinds, from the 
ordinary farmhouse sausage made with equal parts 
of fat and lean pork, seasoned with pepper and salt 
to taste, to the delicate aauciase truffee au foie graa 
of the high class Italian warehouse. It is clearly 
impossible within the limits of this book to give an 
exhaustive list of these dainties, but perhaps the 
following recipes may at least be to some degree 
representative of the various types. 

As said before, sausages may be roughly divided 
between those requiring almost immediate consump- 
tion, and those which are smoked and otherwise 
prepared to make them keep, in some cases almost 
indefinitely. Before, however, considering the 
sausages themselves, a few words must be said 
concerning the mincer and the skins used in their 
manufacture. The simpler the mincer the better, 
for any complicated arrangements which render 
difficult its thorough and constant cleansing are 
to be avoided. It should be taksea. "^ ^^-^-^ 



'^SV. 



156 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

thoroughly well washed, and carefully dried each 
time it is used; for this reason, if the cook is a 
fairly careful woman, an enamelled lined mincer is 
to be most recommended ; these, however, chip very 
readily, and therefore careless treatment is fatal to 
them. A very nice, and absurdly cheap American 
mincer, the " Universal chopper," has been brought 
out of late, which is an excellent all-round machine 
for family use, possessing cutters for different 
purposes, and delightfully easy to take apart and 
clean. Soda and boiling water are not expensive, 
but a dirty mincer is decidedly extravagant, as it 
inevitably spoils everything entrusted to it. 

As regards the skins, these are usually procured 
ready prepared from the butcher, but it is advisable 
even then to rinse them very thoroughly at home. 
Then, again, skins put up in tins may be procured 
from first-class Italian warehousemen, and are also 
supplied by some of the makers of mincing machines. 
These tinned skins require thorough soaking — or 
they may give an over strong salt taste to the sausage 
meat — they should then be fixed to the tap, and the 
water allowed to run freely through them. If, how- 
ever, the skins must be prepared at home, wash and 
scrape them thoroughly, using strong salt and water 
for this purpose, and let them soak for some days in 
salted water ; then repeat the scraping and washing, 
and lastly run the water from the tap through them 
until they are perfectly fresh and sweet, without the 
slightest odour about them. They are filled by 
slipping one end over the filler-spout of the mincer, 
and tieing it firmly into position. Then force in the 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 157 

farce, being careful not to overfill the skins — or they 
will burst — and give the skin a twist at convenient 
lengths, fastening these by looping them through 
each other, giving a tight twist each time. 

The ordinary method of making sausages is 
given above, but this recipe is varied in almost 
every household. For instance, three parts of lean 
to two parts fat pork, seasoned with finely crushed 
salt, freshly ground black pepper, and, when liked, & 
dessertspoonful of very finely minced sage ; or take^ 
say, a pound each of good veal (free from skin, 
gristle, &c.), lean pork, and fat pork; mince this 
very finely, and strew over it loz. salt, ^oz. pepper, a 
small nutmeg grated, and a small teaspoonful of 
pounded mace ; or, add to either of the previous 
recipes from one-third to one-half the bulk of the 
meat in freshly grated white bread crumbs, season- 
ing these with white pepper, salt, and spice if liked,, 
or using the French "Quatre Apices " mixture. 

Oxford Sausages, — These are made of lean veal 
and pork, and very finely minced or shred suet, or 
flead, as preferred, allowing ^Ib. freshly grated 
bread crumbs to each lib. of meat. These are 
seasoned with pepper, salt, powdered herbs (a tea- 
spoonful of mixed herbs to each pound of meat), 
grated lemon peel, and a finely minced anchovy, as 
you please. These seasonings may be varied to 
taste. 

Truffled Sausages, — Mince fairly fine lib. 4oz. of 
fat and fib. of lean pork, seasoning this with f oz. of 
salt, and three or four good pinches of the quatre 
epices ; for this quantity stir in 6oz. sliced truffles^ 



158 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

and mix it to a paste with about a gill of new milk 
or single cream. 

Saucisse au Vin, — ^Prepare a farce as for the 
truffled sausage, only moistening it with champagne, 
Madeira, or any good Rhine wine as you please. A 
variation of this is made by mincing two parts lean 
to one of fat pork, and seasoning this with a pinch 
of saltpetre, pepper, salt, and a fairly strong flarour- 
ing of aromatics, such as juniper berries, marjoram, 
thyme, coriander, &c. Work these ingredients well 
together, moistening them with half a pint of light 
white wine, or best white wine vinegar ; fill, and tie 
in the usual way, then hang them up for five days in 
a cool, dry place ; even in sunmier these sausages re- 
quire keeping forty-eight hours before eating them. 

Sa^icisse au foie gras, — For this take any delicate 
sausage mixture, such as the one made with veal 
(but without bread), and to each poimd of the 
sausage farce allow from 2oz. to 4oz. of foie gras, 
previously sieved, and, of course, add some sliced 
truffles. In private houses these are made very 
small, but in France this reckons amongst the 
saucissons, and is made as thick as a man's wrist ; 
the skins also are dyed with a little liquid carmine 
before the meat is put in; the sausages are then 
steamed till cooked (from half to three-quarters of an 
hour), and then left till thoroughly cold, when the 
outside is brushed well over with boiled olive oil, or 
else the sausage is dipped bodily into melted white 
paraffin wax. Either of these processes ensui^s its 
keeping for a certain time, but these sausages aro 
delicate. 



MEAT, Ac, TO CURE. 159 

Chicken and Ham Sausage, — Mince finely some 
cold cooked cliicten and ham, or tongue (using two 
parts chicken to one of ham), and to each pound of 
this mixture allow 2oz. of ham fat or loz. of fresh 
butter, and two or three button mushrooms. Mix 
well, run it through the mincer, season with salt, 
white pepper, a dust of pounded cloves, and the 
same of coralline pepper. Use the dyed skins for 
this sausage, steam it three-quarters of an hour or 
so, then let it cool, and, if to keep, oil, or dip in the 
melted white wax. Game can be used in the same 
way, only reduce the quantity of ham considerably, 
using, say, 4oz. to the pound, adding freshly-made 
breadcrumbs to make up the weight (say 2oz. to 4oz.), 
and, if at hand, the livers of the game previously 
tossed in a little butter, season with salt, mace, and 
a dash of coralline pepper, and finish as before. 
These do not require steaming, as the flesh is cooked. 

Leher-wurst. — Boil, or rather stew, equal parts 
of lean and fat pork in a very little water, then 
run them through the mincer ; well wash and dry 
the same quantity of calf's liver as you have pork, 
and then grate it down finely. Prepare a seasoning 
by mixing well together (for every 41b. of meat and 
liver) a tablespoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of 
powdered cloves, a teaspoonful each of white and 
black pepper, and 4oz. of raw onion, or rather less 
shallot, cut up as small as possible. Mix this well 
with the pork and the liver, working it well together 
to get it thoroughly blended ; and, lastly, take the 
fat which rose from the pork when cooking, adding 
to it sufficient good lard to make ^Ib. altogether. 



160 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

melt this and pour it on to the above mixture. 
Have ready some large skins, and only three parts 
fill them, tying them securely ; lastly, cook them, for 
about three-quarters of an hour in the liquid in 
which the pork was cooked, then drain them, and 
hang them up to dry in a cool, airy place. These 
sausages can be used at once, or else can be smoked 
for a couple of days, in which case they will keep. 

Ohorissa, — Take equal parts of fat and lean pork 
cut from the prime joints of the pig (this is a 
Spanish sausage, for which the acorn-fed pigs of the 
cork woods — about the most delicately flavoured pork 
in the world — are always used) ; mince this finely ; 
cut a clove of garlic and rub a bowl or basin pretty- 
freely with the cut side, turn the minced pork into this, 
and season it pretty highly with cayenne or coralline 
pepper, and a little salt ; now pour over it sufficient 
dry sherry to cover the meat, and let it stand in 
a cool, dry place till the wine is all or nearly all 
absorbed. Now put the meat into skins, adding to it 
any of the wine that may be left, tie the sausages, 
hang them in a cool, dry place, and when wanted 
drop them into boiling water, and simmer gently till 
cooked. They will keep six or eight months. 

German 8au8age8,-r-Cho^, not too finely, one part 
each of fat and lean pork and two parts lean beef ; 
for every 21b. of meat, take loz. salt, Joz. pepper, 
rather less sugar, and a pinch of saltpetre; infuse 
two garlic cloves in a full half pint of Rhine wine, 
and strain it into the mixture when fully flavoured, 
working the meat, seasoning, and wine well together ; 
then fill calves' bladders with the mixture, dry for

five or six days, and hang up in a cool, dry place. 
These sausages are excellent smoked, and, indeed, if 
to be eaten as they are abroad, uncooked, should be 
thoroughly smoked, say for ten days or so. Another 
way is to mince finely 31b. of lean pork, 21b. of lean 
beef, and lib. of fat pork into tiny dice ; season this 
with 3oz. salt, ^oz. pepper, and a tiny pinch of 
saltpetre; add the seasoning gradually as you chop 
the meat, then turn the mince into a bowl well 
rubbed with garlic, pour on to it a gill of claret or 
Burgundy, and let it stand for six or seven hours in 
a cool place. Then fill the skins as tightly as you 
can, pressing the meat well down; let the sausages 
stand for a few hours, then again press down the 
meat to ensure the skins being perfectly filled. Now 
wind a piece of new tape backwards and forwards 
round the sausages once, tie this securely, and hang 
the sausages in the smoking cupboard for ten or 
twelve days. These sausages should be about ten to 
fifteen inches long. They are generally eaten in 
thin slices without any further cooking, but if pre- 
ferred they can be simmered very gently for an hour, 
being careful not to let them quite boil. 

Bologna Sausage. — For this, mince finely a nice 
piece of lean beef, free from sinew or gristle ; chop 
coarsely twice the quantity of lean pork, and have 
ready a quarter as much of fat bacon, cut into 
neat, and not too small dice. This fat should have 
stood for twenty-four hours before being cut up. 
Season all this with lib. salt, l^oz. each of black and 
white pepper, or use haK groimd pepper, half black 
peppercorns, and a little ^q\j minced garlic \ -scis.^

all well, put it into large bladders, tieing these with 
tape, and finish off as directed for Glernian sausages. 

Beef Sausages. — These are generally made of the 
scraps and trimmings left over after cutting up 
joints, and are consequently apt to be tough and 
hard, but they will be found excellent if good lean 
beef, free from gristle and sinew, be used, the best 
proportions being 14oz. lean beef to 8oz. to lOoz 
beef fat or suet, and 4oz. to 6oz. of breadcrumbs, 
seasoning rather highly with salt, black pepper, and 
cayenne. Some people add a little finely minced 
shallot, and a tiny pinch of saltpetre. 

Smoked Scotch Sausages. — The best way to make 
these is when a " mart '* is being salted down for the 
winter. Take some beef that has been salted for two 
days, and mince it with some suet; season highly 
with salt, pepper, and onion or shallot, then fill the 
skins, tie and twist them into shape, and dry the 
sausages, or smoke them for a month or so in the 
chimney. 

Jewish Sausages. — Grate some Hamburg beef, add 
to it half its weight of finely minced suet, and 2^oz. 
powdered allspice for each pound of meat. Pass 
it all twice through the mincer, then pound to a 
smooth paste, and fill some skins, leaving room for 
them to swell a little. Steam for thirty-five to 
forty-five minutes, then let them cool, and when cold 
brush them over with boiled oHve oil. 



The following recipes do not refer to sausages, 
but will be found both excellent and useful. 

Beef Collared. — For this choose the thin flank. 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 163 

and see that the meat is young, tender, and not too 
fat. Eub this well with salt and a very little 
saltpetre, and let it drain for a night ; then rub it 
thoroughly with a mixture of salt, sugar, pepper, 
and allspice, and let it lie in this for ten days, if the 
weather is cold, turning it daily, and basting it well 
with its own pickle. Now bone it, removing all 
gristle and the coarse inner skin, dry it, strew the 
inside with minced herbs and quatre epices (or cook's 
pepper), then roll it up as neatly and tidily as 
possible, binding it with strips of calico, and then 
with tape ; now press it under a heavy weight for 
some hours, after which undo the bandages, re-roll 
the meat, tie it up again very tightly, then put it on 
in boiling water with a bunch of herbs and some 
soup vegetables, bring the water again to the boil, 
and then simmer it very slowly till cooked, which it 
will be in about three or four hours. When cooked, 
again press it till perfectly cold, and do not take off 
the bandage till it is. (A good shoulder of mutton, 
boned, can be used thus.) 

Beef, Dutch. — Choose a good-sized round of 
beef and rub it well with brown sugar, leaving it in 
its pickle for three days, turning and rubbing it 
constantly, then wipe it, and rub it thoroughly with 
2oz. of saltpetre well pounded, and mixed with 4oz. 
of common and 4oz. of bay salt ; keep it in this for 
a fortnight, turning it daily, then roll it up tight in 
a cloth, and press it under a heavy weight, after which 
you smoke it, still rolled up in its cloth. Boil or 
stew it piecemeal as it is wanted, pressing it well till 
cold, when it is excellent gjrsAfc^. '^tc^fc ^^'^-^^sfe

pickle their beef Hke this, but add nutmeg and 
mace to the spices with which it is rubbed for the 
fortnight. 

Beef, Hamburg, — The winter is the best time for 
preparing this, though it must not be done when 
there is a hard frost. Prepare a mixture by rm'Ting 
together very thoroughly 21b. of brown sugao-, loz. 
pyroligneous acid, 2oz. each of saltpetre, bay salt, 
long peppers, allspice, and cloves, and loz. dried and 
ground juniper berries ; work into this from 8oz. to 
lOoz. common salt, and when this is all well blended, 
rub it into a good piece of round of beef, which 
has already been hung for ten days ; then place it in 
the trough, and turn and rub it daily, night and 
morning, for ten days, being careful that the mixture 
is well rubbed inland on, every part for forty minutes 
or so each time. When pickled, lift out the meat, 
wipe it dry, and sew it up in a coarse sacking, 
pressing it into a nice compact shape, and then 
smoke it in the cupboard for four or five days, being 
careful to use oak shavings and sawdust. Let 
it cool for a day, and then press it for three days, 
after which it must be himg up. Abroad this is 
considered sufficiently cooked by the smoking, and 
though it is frequently boiled in England, the flavour 
is never so good, for grating, at all events. Take ofl 
the sacking after smoking, and, if not to be used at 
once, sew it up again in a clean linen cover. Oi 
else it can be dipped in melted paraffin wax after it 
has cooled down after smoking, and then it keeps 
admirably. The quani ities for the pickle are given 
for about 121b. of beef. To serve this meat you 



MEAT, &c., TO CURB. 165 

either grate it, or else slice it into slices 2iiii. long 
by IJin. wide, and as thin as white paper. 

Beeff Ham. — Take a nice, well- shaped leg of 
beef and trim it into a ham shape. Pound together 
loz. bay salt, loz. saltpetre, lib. common salt, and 
lib. coarse sugar ; this will be enough for a leg 
weighing from 141b. to 151b. Rub this mixture well 
into the beef, turning and rubbing it every day for 
a month, basting it well with its own pickle ; then 
take it out, rub it in bran or sawdust, and hang it in 
the smoke cupboard for a month, after which it can 
be taken down and hung in a dry place till wanted. 

Bear hams are done in precisely the same way, 
though many people think the bear ham improved by 
being first marinaded in oil, vinegar, herbs, &c. 

Jewish. — Choose a nice piece of the 

round, and rub it well with a mixture of pounded 
mace, cloves, nutmeg, juniper berries, and pepper, 
then add to this, salt, Jamaica pepper, and some bay 
leaves ; let it lie in this pickle for ten days, strewing 
it well with sliced shallot or garlic, or both ; boil 
some good white wine vinegar, and then set it aside to 
cool ; now turn the meat and its pickle into a deep 
pan, and pour the vinegar over it when cold, and 
cover down close. In a hot climate, the vinegar is 
allowed just to cover the meat, and over it is poured 
a layer of olive oil, and the pan is then closely 
covered down. 

Bed. — Choose beef with as little bone a.s 

may be (the flank is best), sprinkle it well with salt, 
and let it drain for twenty-four hours ; now rub it 
with the following mixture : lib. commoiL ^^&3A»^ 



166 PICKLES AKD PRESERVES. 

loz. bay salt, loz. saltpetre, and |lb. coarse sugar, 
pounded and well mixed. (A few grains of 
powdered cochineal added to this pickle improves 
the colour.) Rub this pickle well into the beef 
for a week, turning and basting it daily, then 
leave it in the pickle three or four days longer, 
only turning, but not rubbing it. It is excellent 
for cooking in eight days or so, but if to be smoked, 
leave it sixteen days in the pickle, then drain it, and 
smoke for a few days. This makes delicious sand- 
wiches. 

Beef, Salted in a Hurry, — Rub some 51b. oi 
61b. of beef well with salt, then flour well a coarse 
clean cloth, and fold the meat up in this, lay it in a 
pan of boiling water and cook as long as you would 
any other salt beef of the same size, and it will eat 
as salt as if salted for four or five days. 

Bound, to Salt. — ^For 251b. of round 

take 2oz. of saltpetre, 4oz. of pepper, 6oz. of sugar, 
and ^Ib. each of bay and common salt ; rub the meat 
well aU over with this mixture, rubbing, basting, 
and turning it daily for a month. It can then be 
hung up and dried, or boiled straight as it comes 
out of the pickle. As in most of these old-fashioned 
recipes, it must be observed that the boiling here 
spoken of is in reality gentle simmering. 

Whole, to Salt, — Take as much cold 

spring water as will well cover the meat you wish to 
salt, and with this water and bay salt make a brine 
strong enough to float a potato ; boil this well 
together tiQ the salt is dissolved and all the scum 
has ceased to rise, let it stand till cold, then pour it 



MEAT, &c., TO CURE. 167 

over the meat in the pickling tub or barrel. This 
is an old Scotch recipe used when a ** mart " or 
bullock was killed and the whole salted down for 
the winter use of the family. 

Mutton Hams, — These can be cured by almost- 
any recipe given for pork ham, and if smoked make 
excellent rashers. 

Sprats, to Pickle, — ^Pound together 21b. common 
salt, 4oz. each of bay salt and saltpetre, 2oz. sal 
prunella, and a little cochineal. Now have ready a 
peck of sprats, and pack these in a stone jar, a row 
of sprats, then a layer of the above mixture, and 
repeat these two layers, pressing them down well till 
the jar is full; cover down closely, and keep in a 
cool, dry place for six months, when they will be 
ready. The sprats must be as fresh as it is possible 
to get them, and must be neither wiped nor washed. 

Salmon, to Kipper, — Cut up, clean and scale the 
fish, and remove the bone neatly, then rub it well all 
over with equal parts of salt and brown sugar, to 
which you add a tiny pinch of saltpetre ; let the fish 
lie in this for two days, covering it with a board 
rather heavily weighted, then hang it up to dry, if to 
be used as what is called " green kipper " ; or if to 
be kept, smoke it. To prevent the folds spoiling, it 
is a good plan to spread open the fish, stretching it 
out with wooden skewers. Some housewives add 
freshly ground black pepper to the salt and sugar. 
It hardens very quickly, and if kept long in the 
smoking cupboard the slices should be soaked for 
twenty to thirty minutes before cooking. Herring 
and mackerel are deUcious kippered in this way. 



168 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Caveached Fish, — Cut the fish into slices, fillets, 
or pieces, as is most convenient, sprinkle them with 
pepper and salt (using white pepper for delicate 
fish), then fry these in oil. When cooked, drain, 
and put them aside to cool. Boil some vinegai 
(sufficient to cover the fish well), with enough white 
peppercorns, a few cloves, a blade or so of mace, and 
salt to flavour the vinegar well. Allow this to 
become cold, then pour to it a gill of oil ; now pack 
the fish in a jar with very thinly sliced onion 
between each piece or layer of fish, and then pour 
the pickle over it all. Keep it well covered. Any 
fish can be treated in this way, salmon being 
particularly good, but requiring to stand for a 
day or two, as it breaks if put quite fresh into 
the pickle. Some people add a few peppercorns and 
bay leaves to the pickle. 



CHAPTEE XII. 

ODDS AND ENDS. 

In this chapter will be found odds and ends of 
recipes that did not appear properly to belong to any 
of the foregoing chapters, and are therefore gathered 
up here indiscriminately. 

Barberries, to Preserve. — Choose fine bunches of 
the berries, or, if needful, make up pretty groups by 
binding them delicately together with white filoselle 
or fine sewing silk, and stone them with a needle. 
Cover the bottom of a preserving pan three inches 
deep with syrup, boiled to the thread, now put in 
the fruit, and let it boil up again, lifting the pan off 
directly it boils ; let it stand for half an hour, then 
boil up again and lift out the fruit ; now boil the 
sugar again for ten minutes, and again pour it over 
the fruit. Let it all stand till next day, then boil 
up the syrup again, and strain it over the berries, 
after which tie down when cool, and store. Mind 
the syrup is well skimmed all the time, and if boil- 
ing the fruit in it should discolour it, clear it at the 
last boiling with the whipped white and shell of an 
Bgg. Rowan (or mountain ash) berries can be pre- 
served in the same way. 



170 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

Barberries f in Brine, — Make the bunches up 849 be- 
fore, and store them in jars in a strong salt and 
water brine, and tie down with a bladder ; when a 
scum rises replace the brine with fresh, but always 
keep the berries well covered. Mountain ash or 
rowan berries can be preserved in this way. 

Walnuts, to Keep, — Put a layer of very dry sea 
sand at the bottom of a jar, and on this a layer of 
nuts, then more sand and more nuts, till the jar is 
full, but be careful that the nuts never touch each 
other in any of the layers. When wanted for use 
lay them in warm water for an hour, shifting the 
water as it cools, then rub them dry, and they will 
peel easily and eat well. Most nuts can be kept in 
this way. Another way, and one much practised 
abroad, is to pack the nuts, which must be perfectly 
sound, into stoneware jars with tight-fitting lids, and 
when they are packed close cover down tightly, and 
bury them from eighteen to twenty-four inches below 
the ground in a cool border, or bury in sand in a 
corner of a dry cellar. 

Chapes, to Keep, — When cutting the bunches from 
the vine, be careful always to leave a joint of the 
stalk on them ; now hang them up from a cord in a 
dry room, so that the bunches do not touch each 
other in any way, for imless the air can pass freely 
round and through them the grapes will mould and 
spoil. Many housewives close the ends of the stalk 
with sealing wax. Examine them at intervals to see 
how they are keeping. 

Artichoke Bottoms, to Keep, — Pull the artichokes 
from the stalk just before they are fully grown (as this 



ODDS AND ENDS. 171 

pulling draws out all the strings from the bottoms) , 
and boil them till the leaves come off at a touch ; 
then strip the bottoms from the leaves and choke^ 
and set them to dry on tins in a cool oven. Repeat 
this drying till they are quite desiccated, which you 
will know is completed if on holding them up to the 
light they appear transparent. Now put them 
in paper bags, hang them up in a dry place, and they 
will keep good for a year. When required for use 
steep them in warm water for three or four hours, 
changing the water two or three times in the process. 

Lemons and Limes, to Keep. — These may be kept 
by the same recipe as is recommended- for walnuts, 
i.e., in sand; or they can be hung up in nets in 
such a way that the air can get all round them freely, 
being careful they do not touch one another in any 
way. Abroad they are preserved in crocks full 
of cold water, which is changed weekly, care being 
taken to keep them weU immersed. 

Foliage, to Dry, for Decorative Purposes. — Take 
nice asparagus fronds, maidenhair, or any other 
ferns, or autumnal foliage, and lay it carefully be- 
tween sheets of clean blotting paper, and weight 
these down evenly under heavy books; next day 
turn them, iron them with a rather cool iron, and 
return them to whatever press you choose (the 
napkin press is capital for this purpose). Repeat 
this turning every twenty-four hours till the leaves 
are quite dry and tough, but not brittle, and still 
preserve their colour. The great secret about this 
process is to do it as slowly as possible, for if the 
least hurried the leaves will crisp up and diaQAk»^is.. 



172 PICKLES AND PRESERVES. 

After use they should be returned to their paper and 
press, and, if carefully treated, will last a long time. 
Maidenhair prepared thus is specially valuable, as 
it keeps both colour and shape admirably, and 
naturally does not wither as fresh gathered fern is 
apt to do in a hot room. Some people brush ferns 
over when dry with a very weak solution of gum 
arabic, to which a drop or two of green colour may or 
may not be added, as you choose. 

Rose Petal Conserve. — Make a syrup with lib. of 
best cane loaf sugar and as little good rose water as 
you can manage ; take lib. of rose leaves of the old- 
fashioned red cabbage kind, and dry these in the 
shade, after which wash them for a minute in boiling 
water ; then drain and dry them, and add them to 
the syrup with a spoonful of good orange flower 
water ; cook this to a marmalade, and pot in the 
usual way. This is a Greek recipe, and abroad is 
much liked, though for English taste it is distinctly 
sweet. 

Eahat la Koum (or Turkish Delight). — Make a 
clear syrup with lib. of best cane loaf sugar and a 
pint of water (in Turkey and Greece this would be 
either rose or orange flower water, but for European 
tastes this is decidedly too sweet) ; dear this syrup 
with the white of an egg and the juice of half a lemon 
in the usual way ; meanwhile dissolve 2oz. of the finest 
wheat starch as smoothly as possible in a gill of 
water, strain it and a'ld it while boiling to the 
syrup, and boil it all together till it is quite thick 
and ropy ; then flavour it pretty strongly with rose 
or orange flower water. Now have ready two plates. 



ODDS AND EKDS. 173 

one thickly brushed over with almond or sweet oil, 
the other as thickly dusted with sugar; pour the 
mixture on to the oiled plate and let it stand for a 
minute or so to cool, turn it over on to the sugared 
plate, then wipe off any oil that may adhere, cut it 
into blocks, dust it thickly with sugar, and let it 
stand till fairly dry, being careful the pieces do not 
stick together ; and then pack in grease-proof paper 
and store in tin boxes. Of course, any other 
flavouring essence may be used instead of the orange 
or rose water. 

Nougat de Montelimart. — Blanch, peel, and dry in 
the oven lib. of sweet almonds and 4oz. of pistachios, 
without, however, allowing them to discolour, and 
blanch and bake 4oz. of almonds to a red brown. 
Now put into a pan 12oz. of best white honey, and 
the same of best cane caster sugar, and boil these 
together to the crack ; then pour it on to the stiffly 
whipped whites of five eggs, whisking it well 
together, and allow it all to simmer gently till, on 
dipping your finger and thumb into water, and then 
into the syrup, the latter does not adhere to the 
fingers ; when you can make it " ball," lift the pan 
from the fire, and stir in the almonds, white and 
brown, and the pistachios. Have ready spread on a 
board a sheet of wafer paper, and spread this as- 
evenly as you can with the mixture in a layer fully 
two inches thick; on this place another sheet of 
wafer paper, and, lastly, lay a board or a clean tin 
on the top and weight it evenly. Let it stand till 
the next day, when it can be cut in blocks and 
packed in grease-proof paper in a tin box. You cbjdl

make many yarieties of this nougat; for instance, 
chocolate nougat, when you use Ijlb. of blanched 
hazel nuts and 12oz. of grated chocolate instead of 
the almonds and pistachios, and make in just the 
«ame way ; or you can mix in crystallised rose leaves 
or violets, varying the nuts by using broken-up 
walnuts or pignole (fir cone nuts), &c. 

Turon Blanco (Spanish Nougat), — Into a bright 
<jopper stewpan put |lb. of best cane icing sugar, the 
whites of two eggs, and a tablespoonful of either 
rose or orange flower water, as you please; whisk all 
this together over a slow fire till it is of the con- 
sistency of fairly stifE meringue paste, then stir into 
this mass 8oz. each of blanched and finely shred 
almonds and pistachios. When this is all perfectly 
blended, run the mixture into little straight moulds 
(three and a half to four inches long by one and 
n half inches wide and deep), which have been 
previously well brushed over with almond oil. 
When these bars are firm and set, pack in an air- 
tight tiQ, between layers of grease-proof paper. This 
is a favourite Christmas sweet in Spain, and is 
sometimes also made, like the French nougat, with 
honey. 

Cocoanut Cones. — Scrape and pound the flesh of a 
fresh cocoanut, and for one of ordinary size allow 
the white of one egg beaten to a stiff froth, and a 
spoonful of caster sugar, with rose-water to taste ; 
stir this all together tUl stiff enough to shape into 
little cones, which are then placed in a very slack 
oven till the outside is crisp and stiff, but not 
<joloured. The centre should be quite soft. These 



ODDS Am) ENDS. 175 

can be flavoured with any essence or liqueur to 
taste. 

Barley Sugar. — ^Prepare first of all some barley 
water, by pouring a quart of cold water on to a 
handful of common barley ; add the quarter of' a 
thinly pared lemon rind, and let it all simmer to- 
gether for a couple of hours ; let it stand for a little, 
and then pour it off carefully, when it should be 
quite clear. (H this is wanted simply as a drink, it 
must be flavoured and sweetened to taste, and if in a 
hurry a little can be got in half an hour, but it is not 
so good as when properly made ; if iced, this makes a 
delicious summer drink.) Now dissolve 21b. of best 
cane loaf sugar in a pint of this barley water, and 
bring it to the " ball," add a little lemon juice, and 
re-boil to the " great crack " ; now add a few drops 
of essence of lemon, pour the mass on to an oiled 
marble slab, and cut it into strips. Allow these to 
cool, and when nearly cold take each strip and twist 
it in your hands, and pack when perfectly cold in 
air-tight tins. 

Toffee (Assafrey). — This toffee is made by a well- 
known Glasgow confectioner, and is a form of the 
popular Russian toffee. Put into a delicately clean 
stewpan a pound of brown (cane) sugar, with 4oz. of 
butter and a tablespoonful of water ; bring this to 
the boil, then add to it a dessertspoonful of essence 
of vanilla and a gill of cream. Boil this till on 
dropping a little into cold water it will harden ; then 
colour with a little cochineal or carmine, boil two 
minutes more, lift it off the fire and let it go off the 
boil before pouring it on to an oiled or butteNa^-'oss.^

cutting it into squares, bars, &c., as you please, when 
partially set. 

Toffee {Russian), — ^Make the toffee in the usual 
way, only using lib. of sugar, about 14oz. of cream, 
and a teaspoonful of essence of vanilla. Some 
people stir blanched and shred pistachios into this, 
and cut it into bars. Toffee is like nougat in its 
variations. For instance, scrape down Joz. of best 
vanilla chocolate and mix it very smooth with a 
little single cream or new milk, gradually adding 
more milk, till you have used a gill altogether ; then 
add to this 6oz. of fresh butter, 12oz. brown sugar, 
and a tablespoonful of treacle; boil this altogether 
for twenty minutes, stirring it all the time, for it is 
very apt to catch, add a little essence of vanilla, then 
turn it out to cool on a buttered tin. This should 
never be crisp, but of the consistency of chocolate. 
It is a very favourite bonbon in India. Or, add an 
ounce of ground ginger to every ^Ib. of brown sugar 
used in toffee making, and this will make a very nice 
ginger toffee. 

Popcorn, — This is not at all difficult to prepare. 
Any comchandler will supply the necessary Indian 
corn. Take a "popper" (this is a kind of frying- 
pan with holes in it, but a fine meshed frying basket 
answers capitally), cover the bottom of this not too 
thickly with the com, and sprinkle this lightly with 
caster sugar. Now shake it over a very slow fire 
or a gas ring (mind the gas is turned down low) till 
the corn is all " popped." If you use coloured sugar 
you can vary this to any extent. 

Almonds (Devilled). — Blanch the almonds, and 



ODDS AND ENDS. 177 

cook them in hot oil or butter till a delicate golden 
brown (this will take eight or nine minutes), then 
drain for a minute or two in front of the fire, on 
kitchen paper, after which jou roll them in cayenne 
and a little salt, tossing them in this till well coated, 
then set them in the oven for about five minutes 
to dry and crisp. Salted. — Proceed exactly in the 
same way, but use roughly crushed salt, or, better 
still, a little freezing salt, as this looks like little 
crystals. You can vary these flavourings to taste. 
All sorts of nuts can be done thus ; hazel nuts and 
walnuts, blanched and halved, are particularly good, 
if tossed either in celery salt, or in Searcy salt. 

Fruit Paste, — A very nice dessert sweet can be 
made with the fruit pulp left over after jelly making, 
if it is all rubbed through a sieve and boiled sharply 
to a dry paste ; then, to each pound (weighed before 
sieving) stir in 6oz. or 7oz. of caster sugar, and 
boil it all together for about twenty- five minutes 
more, taking care it does not bum. Of course, this 
paste is nicer if aU the juice has not been extracted 
from the fruit. 

Fruit Drops, — Stir together over the fire, almost 
to boiling point, any good thick fruit juice, with 
sugar in the proportion of ^Ib. of sugar to each 
half gill of fruit syrup. When it is sufficiently 
cooked, drop it in round drops on an oiled slab, and 
leave it till set. 

Cherries, to Dry, — Choose very ripe fruit, and stalk 
and stone them ; arrange them on dishes or old trays, 
and leave them in the sim till dry and shrivelled. 
If the weather will not admit of thia^ "^xvi* ^3aa Nx.**:^'^

into the oven, or on the top of the stove, overnight, 
after the cooking is over, and leave them there till 
next day, repeating this process for two or three 
nights till the fruit is properly reduced. These are 
excellent for cakes, <&c., as 'they are, but if soaked in 
luke-warm water for a little, they swell out, and make 
delicious compote and tarts. They must be kept in 
air-tight tins or bottles. 

Danison Cheese, — Stew the fruit till tender, then 
drain off the juice, remove the skins aud stones from 
the fruit, return to this pulp about half the jnioe, 
weigh it all, and then boil it over a clear fire to a 
dry paste ; now stir in 6oz. of sugar to every pound 
of the fruit, and keep it stirred over the fire till the 
mixture will leave the sides of the pan and adhere 
to the spoon in a solid mass. If it yields to the 
finger without sticking when touched, it is ready, and 
should at once be turned into little pots or china 
moulds, and when cold covered with a paper cut to 
shape and dipped in spirit, and then covered down in 
the usual way. BuUaces, and, indeed, most plums, 
are good prepared thus. 

Honey. — Formerly honey was always used for 
conserves instead of sugar, which was too dear for 
general use. The only difference is that honey must 
always be most carefully clarified, and, needless to 
add, must first of all be run out of the comb. (See 
recipe for Orange wine, p. 81.) 

Pot Pourri. — G-ather the flowers on a dry day onlvy 

and dry them in the sun (the rose leaves may, if the 

•rather is very dry, be put straight into the jar). 

• pot pourri, roses, clove carnations, lavender and 



ODDS AND ENDS. 179 

rosemary flowers, jasmine, orange blossom, and violets 
may all be used. In fact, any sweet smelling, but not 
succulent, flowers may be used. Shred fine a handful 
each of bay leaves, rosemary, myrtle, lemon thyme, 
and sweet verbena; pound lib. bay salt, 2oz. salt- 
petre, one nutmeg, and Joz. each cloves and allspice, 
and have ready prepared the following mixture: 
One drachm each of musk, spirits of lavender, essence 
of lemon, and storax, loz. bergamot, 6oz. powdered 
orris root, and the finely pared rind of four lemons ; 
mix these all well together and put it in the jar, add- 
ing the flowers as you can get them (with the shredded 
herbs and leaves given above) in the proportion of 
three handfuls each of orange blossom and clove 
pinks, and two each of rosemary and lavender flowers, 
violets, and jasmine, to every six good handfuls of 
very sweet smelling rose leaves (for pot pourri the 
old-fashioned cabbage and single roses are the best) ; 
if the mixture gets too dry, add more bay salt and 
saltpetre; if too moist, more orris root, stirring it all 
well in. Pot pourri cannot be too much stirred. 
Start your pot pourri with the quantities given above, 
and then you can add more flowers or spice, &c., as 
may be needed. This potpourri, which is, it must be 
confessed, a little expensive, is most delicious, and 
keeps good for years. It is an old family recipe. A 
simpler form is the following: Gather the flowers as 
before, and dry in the sun ; beat to a powder a small 
quantity each of musk, storax, gum benjamin, Seville 
orange peel, cloves, orris root, coriander seed, Jamaica 
peppers, lemon peel, &c., as you ple^^afc, «5^^ *S5s. *s^s^

bay salt, and last the spices, mixiiig them well in 
together. 

Baking Powder. — Honestly, this is in these days 
hardly worth the trouble of making, as so many 
good kinds may be bought. But cooks should re- 
member that these powders vary considerably in 
strength, and should therefore be careful when using 
them. The following formula, when baking powder 
must necessarily be home made, will be found satis- 
factory ; Sift together, two or three times, 3oz. each of 
tartaric acid, carbonate of soda, and creme de riz, or 
fine rice flour. 

Lemon Juice. — If at any time you are using much 
lemon peel, or if lemons are cheap, squeeze them 
quite dry into a basin, then strain ofE free from 
pith, &c. Have ready very clean and perfectly dry 
little bottles, and fill them with this juice right up 
to the shoulder ; then pour in sufficient sweet oil to 
cover the juice entirely, cork and seal the bottles 
tightly, and store upright in a cool place. Once the 
bottle is opened the juice must be used at once, as it 
does not keep well after the oil is removed. Lemon 
jpeel can be preserved if dried and packed in 
stoppered bottles. It will grate perfectly. Lemon 
and orange peel alike may be preserved thus : Steep 
the thick skins for a few days in salt and water, then 
boil them in fresh water till soft enough to pieroe 
with the head of a pin ; when you drain and put them 
aside. Boil a poimd of loaf sugar in half a pint of 
water for five minutes, and pour it on to the peels ; 
let it all stand a week, then just boil up the syrup, 
laj in the peel again, and \>o\L ^ ^^ther till the 



ODDS AND ENDS. 181 

peel looks clear, when you lift it out, spread it on » 
disli to cool and dry, sprinkling it weU with castei 
sugar, and when dry store it in tins. It also keeps 
well if poured, syrup and all, when clear, into a 
crock, and kept covered. 

Eggs, to Preserve. — Soak 41b. of lime in two 
gallons of water in an earthenware crock, let it 
stand two days, stirring it now and again, then 
put in the eggs (which must be very fresh) up 
to within three inches of the surface of the pickle. 
Or, mix in a large crock 31b. quicklime, lOoz. salt, 
loz. cream of tartar, and one and a half gallons 
of boiling water. Stir all these ingredients well 
together, let them stand twenty-four hours, then put 
in the eggs, which must be perfectly fresh (if warm 
from the nest so much the better) and entirely 
uncracked. These pickles make the shell rather 
brittle, so that the eggs should never be boiled in 
the ordinary way, but be put on in cold water, and 
then brought gently to iJie boil. Either way the 
eggs will, if carefully packed, keep a long time 
perfectly fresh and good. 

Fbtht in Season. — One can only give averages 
for the preserve-making season, as it must in great 
measure depend on the weather, and the consequent 
growth and ripening of the fruit. Fruit for pre- 
serving should never be quite dead ripe, save in the 
case of medlars, which are not really good till lightly 
touched by the frost, so that discretion must be used 
as to the best time for jam and jelly making. This 
being premised, here are the average seasons for 
various kinds of fruits : 



182 



PIOEtBS AND PRESERVES. 



Applet. — All the year roimd, but at their beai 
Septemher on wards. 

AprieoU (Engltsk). — From Ai^niet to Oci

September. Californian nectarines from February 
to March.

184 PICKLES AND PRESERYES. 

Pines, — Obtainable almost all the year round, but 
dear in the winter. 

Plums. — English, from beginning of August to 
the end of September; French begin and end a 
month earlier, whilst Califomian are to be had from

usually end in August. 

Walnuts. — From September to Christmas, but for

As said before, these are the average times for 
home grown fruit, which alone is fit for preserving 
at present, as the foreign fruit is usually too long 
gathered to make successful preserves. As regards 
dessert fruit, seasons are almost annihilated by the 
colonial and foreign trade, and if the price is no bar, 
almost every kind of fruit can be obtained all the 
year round, and the supply appears likely to increase, 
as the Australian and Calif ornian imports increase 
yearly, and the Cape is now beginning to supply the 
market also. 

Vegetables in Season. — As was said of fruit, 
the seasons for these can only be given approximately, 
but, unlike fruit, they are usually bottled or otherwise
