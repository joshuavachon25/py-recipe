VICTOR FLOUR 
Is the Best ! 

And will continue to be the Best. 

Victor will be the best under all circumstances. 

Some other brands of flour may sometimes 
make as good bread, but for reliability and uniform- 
ity the Victor will be the victor, as it has been the 
victor for the past 14 years. 

Always trouble in the family without good 
bread in the house. 

Its enormous sales are due to the fact that the 
best cooks always use the Victor. 

Don't spend your time, money, patience and 
material in trying to match the Victor with other 
so called "best brands."

SOUPS. 



All meats and boues for soup should be boiled a long time, 
and then set aside until the next day, in order that the fat may 
be removed. Then add the vegetables, rice or herbs from an 
hour to an hour and a half. A slight addition of Tournade's 
Kitchen Bouquet adds greatly to the flavor and color, for 
many of the following recipes. 

TO PKEPARE SOUP STOCK 

Five pounds from a leg of beef, three pounds from a shoul- 
der of lamb, three pounds from a leg of veal. Boil gently 
five hours, putting in one onion and one stalk of celery. Boil 
another hour and then strain, adding ?alt and pepper. This 
is ready for clear soup or for the foundation of other soups. 
CREAM OF BARLEY SOUP. 

One teacup of pearl barley well washed, three pints of chick- 
en or veal clear stock, one onion. Cook slowly together for 
four or five hours ; add one and a half pints of boiling milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of buttei% and three well beaten fj^gs, 
salt arid pepj)er to taste. Let it stay on the stove for a few 
minutes after the milk, eggs and butter are added, but do 
not let it boil. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

One quart of soup stock, one can of Old Reliable tomatoes, 
or one quart stewed tomatoes, four dessert spoons of sugar, 
salt to taste, a little grated nutmeg, four large tablespoonfuls 
of flour, three large tablespoonfuls of butter, rubbed smooth 
and stirred in to thicken. Strain on to cubes of fried bread 
or browned bread, a little pepper. 

BOUILLON 

Six pounds beef and bone, soup bones, for ten persons : 
cut up the meat and break the bones, add two quarts of cold 
water and let it simmer slowly until all the strength is ex- 
hausted from the meat ; it will take about four hours. Straie 
through a fine sieve, removing every particle of fat, and if 
there is more than ten cupfuls reduce, it by boiling to that 
quantity ; season with salt and pepper only. It is served in 
bouillon cups at luncheon and evening comiDanies.

over, add two more layers of each, finishing with the cheese ; 
pour the boiling soup over, cover for a few minutes to give 
time for the cheese to melt and the bread to soak, and serve.

FISH. 

Purchase those which have just bf en caught ; of this you 
can judge by their being hard under the pressure of the fin- 
ger. Cod is best in cold weather. Mackerel is best in Aug- 
ust, September and October. Halibut in May and June. 
Oysters are good from September to April. Lobsters are 
best at the season when oysters are not good. Fish that is 
to be fried should be cut uj) and laid in a cloth for an hour in 
order that the moisture nay be absorbed, season with pepper 
and salt, then roll in fine bread crumbs or corn meal, and fry 
in one-third butter and two-lhirds lard. That which is apt 
to break in frying may be kept whole by being dipped in a 
beaten egg before it is rolled in crumbs. 

TO BOIL SALT COD. 

Let it stand over night in cold water. Put in a kettk, 
let it set where it will keep warm and at length simmer but 
not boil. 

TO BOIL HALIBUT. 

Purchase a thick slice, cut through the body or tail-piece 
which is considered the richest, wrap it in a flannel cloth and 
lay in cold water with salt in it. A piece weighing six pounds 
should cook half an hour after the water boils. 

TO BOIJ. SALMON. 

Clean a salmon in salt and water, allow twenty minutes 
for boiling every pound ; wrap in a floured cloth and lay in a 
kettle while the water is cold, make the water very salt, and 
skim it well. In this respect it requires more care than any 
other fish. 

TO BOIL FRESH COD. 

Rub the fish with salt, wrap it in a cloth, and put it over 
the fire in cold water enough to cover the fish, adding one 
tablespoonf ul of salt ; take ofi" the froth and boil half an hour. 

Cracker Crumbs Always in Stock. 



18 
TO BAKE FISH. 

Make a dressing of chopped bread, pepper, salt, butter, 
and pulverized sage, moisten it with a little water; lay this 
inside the fish, sew ib up, put a skewer through the lip and 
tail, fasten them together with a piece of twine, lay it iu a 
dish, put two or three thin slices of salt pork upon it, sprin- 
kle salt over it and flour well. Baste with the liquid which 
cooks out of it. A fish weighing four pounds will cook in an 
hour. 

TO BROIL SALMON. 

Cut in slices an inch thick, dry it in a cloth, salt it, lay 
upon a hot gridiron, the bars having been rubbed with lard 
or drippings. It cooks very well iu a stove oven, laid in a 
dripping pan. 

TO FRY OYSTERS. 

Lay them in a cloth a few minutes to dry, then dip each 
one in beaten eggs, then in sifted cracker crumbs, and fry in 
just enough fat to brown them. Put pepper and salt on them 
before you turn them over. 

FRICASSEE OF OYSTERS. 

Put one quart of oysters on the fire, in their liquor. The 
moment they begin to boil turn them into a hot dish, through 
a colander, leaving the oysters in the colander. Put in the 
saucepan butter the size of an egg, and when it bubbles up, 
sprinkle in a tablespoonful of sifted flour ; let it cook a min- 
ute without taking color, stirring it well with a wire egg 
whisk, then add one cup of oyster liquor. Take it from the 
fire and mix in the yolks of two eggs, a little salt, a little 
cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, and one 
grated nutmeg ; beat it well ; then return to the fire to set 
the eggs without allowing it to boil. Put in the oysters. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Crush or roll sevei'al handfuls of oyster crackers, put a 
Ixyer in the bottom of a buttered pudding dish, wet this with 
milk slightly warm ; next a layer of oysters sprinkled with 
salt, pepper, and bits of buttex", then another layer of cracker 
crumbs, moistened with milk, and so on until your dish is

and bake an hour ; ornament with split crackers. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 
Line patty.pans with a rich paste, put a piece of bread in 
each to keep them in shape, bake, and, when cool, turn them 
out upon a dish. Stew a pint of oysters one or two minutes 
in their own liquor. Turn on the liquor ; put two or three 
oysters in each puff and cover with hot asparagus dressing. 
Serve immediately. 

CLAMS IN CEEAM. 
Put butter size of an egg into a spider with a tablespoon 
of flour. Stir and cook slowly but not to brown. Add one- 
half cup of clam water. When this comes to a boil add one 
pint of chopped clams. Just before serving add one cup of 
cream, being careful that it does not come to a boil after the 
cream is put in. Pepper to taste. 

SALT FISH BALLS No. 1. 
One cup of raw salt fish, three cups of boiled potatoes, 
one tablespoon of melted butter, one tablespoon of sweet 
milk, one Bgg^ a little pepper. Wash the fish and pick from 
the bones; put in cold water and .^et it stand on the back 
of the stove until fresh enough. Mash or beat the fish and 
potatoes until light, make in little balls, roll in flour and fry 
in plenty of hot fat. 

FISH BALLS No. 2. 
Boil the potatoes, and while still hot peel and mash 
them. Then to each four cupfuls of potatoes add two cup- 
f uls of fish previously chopped fine, one egg, a piece of butter 
the size of an egg. Work thoroughly with the hands, adding 
at the same time milk enough to mold well, and season with 
salt and pepper to suit the taste. Roll into bnlls and fry 
brown on both sides. Serve hot. 

SCALLOPED CLAMS. 

Put stale bread in oven to dry, roil fine, then put in a 

dish a layer of crumbs, then a layer of clams, cut in small 

pieces, season with butter and pepper, so on until the dish is 

full. Pour the clam water over it and bake one hour. Rolled

onion chopped fine, butter size of a large egg, three table- 
spoonfuls flour, cooked all together ; remove from the fire 
and stir in one well beaten egg ; add a very little cayenne 
pepper, and salt if necessary. The green of the lobster must 
be added to the dressing when cold. Put the chopped lob- 
ster into the dish in which it is to be served or into the 
shells; pour over the dressing t lowly until all is thoroughly 
moistened ; then sprinkle cracker crumbs over the top. Bake 
fifteen minutes. Serve (if in the shells) on a napkin gar- 
nished with parsley. 

SARDINE SANDWICHES. 

One slice of bread, buttered and halved, remove the 
crust. Split a sardine and remove the bone. Put on one- 
half a slice, sprinkle a little lemon juice over it and cover 
with the other half. 

TURBOT A LA CREME. 

Boil three or four pounds of haddock ; take out all the 
bones and shred the fish fine. Let a quart of milk and a 
small onion come to a boil ; stir in a scant cupful of flour 
which has been mixed with a cup of cold milk and the yolks 
of two eggs. Season with one-half teaspoon of white pepper, 
one teaspoon salt, a small piece of butter. Butter a pan, put 
in a layer of fish, then one of sauce ; finish with the sauce 
and over it sprinkle cracker crumbs. Bake an hour in a mod- 
erate oven.

moved, and chop it almost as fine as mince meat. Simmer 
the bones and trimmings (all skin and gristle must be re- 
jected from the juice) for at least an hour, and strain off the 
resulting broth. To a cupful of this stock add a cupful of 
milk or sweet cream, two well beaten eggs and a pinch of 
salt. Use a little of it to moisten the minced chicken and 
set that on in a small saucepan to heat. Cut half a dozen 
thick slices from a loaf of bread, place them in a deep basin 
and pour the sauce over them, "When they have absorbed as 
much as they will take up, fry quickly in a little fresh bntter. 
Spread each slice thinly with the chicken. Good either hot

Split the chicken down the back, cover it over with lumps of 
butter and pepper and salt ; add one-half of a pint of water ; 
cover closely and cook in the oven till done. 
PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Boil two chickens in water enough to cover them until 
Ihe meat will drop from the bones. Then pick from the 
bones and season with salt and pepper. Put first a layer of

and salt and let them stand one hour. Bub with flour before 
frying. Beat two eggs ; dip each piece in this and fry in hot 
lard. Boil one and one-half cups of milk; add a spoonful of

around it and serve. 

CHICKEN POT PIE.

tender. Chop the giblets and put into the broth. Season 
with pepper and salt. To each quart stir in two spoonfuls 
of flour mixed with cream. Break open, butter and throw in 
warm light biscuits. Cover tightly and simmer twenty 
minutes. 

CHICKEN POT PIE. 

Joint the chicken and parboil it. Make a crust the same 
as for soda biscuit, line the sides of the pot (not the bottom) 
with this ; with the chicken lay in thin sliced potatoes, sprin- 
kle in a little pepper, add salt and a bit of mace. If there 
was not broth enough left after parboiling the chicken, add 
water sufficient to cover the chicken when put in the pot ; 
over the whole lay a piece of crust about the thickness of 
soda biscuit. Fold a towel and put over the pot, and put on 
the cover. The towel will hold the steam which rises, and 
prevent its falling back upon the crust to make it heavy. 
Before putting in the broth it should be thickened a little, 
and a little butter added.

MEATS. 



COKNED BEEF 

sbould bs put into hot water to boil. When boiling ham or 
coined beef put in two tablespoons of vinegar to give a 
good color. 

Spring is the best season for mutton ; that which is not 
very large is to be preferred. It should be of a good red and 
white, and fine grain. 

LA.MB 
is best in July and Augu&t. Veal is best in spring. It should 
look white and be fat. The breast is particularly nice stuffed. 
The loin should be roasted. 

BEEFSTEAK. 

Porter House and tenderloin are best. Grease the grid- 
iron. Have it hot. Put your steak over a hot fire, cover 
with a baking pan, turn as soon as colored, watch constantly 
and turn again as soon as browned. It should be quite rare 
or pink in the center. Put on a hot platter, sprinkle with 
pepper and salt, spread butter over it and serve immediately. 
There should be no gravy. Lemon juice and chopped parsley 
added before the butter improves it. 

HINTS ABOUT BOILING MEATS. 

All kinds of meat intended for the table should be put 
into boiling water, thereby retaining the juices. If it is de- 
sired to give a salt flavoring to them, boil a piece of salt pork 
in the water before putting the meat in. A nice piece of 
boiled salt pork is a great addition to all kinds of boiled 
meats. Corned, salt or smoked meats should be put into 
cold water to cook. Great care should be taken to skim the 
scum off well just before the water boils ; for if the scum 
boils into the water, it is impossible to take it off, aad it will 
adhere to the meats.

TO MAKE THE IRISH STEW. 

One of the most inexpensive, palatable and wholesome 
dishes is the Irish stew. About ''.wo pounds of the neck of 
mutton, four onions, six large potatoes, salt, pepper, three 
pints of water and two tablespoonfuls of flour. Cut the mut- 
ton in handsome pieces. Put about half the fat in the stew- 
l^an, with the onions, and stir for eight or ten minutes over a 
hot fire ; then put in the meat, which sprinkle with the flour, 
salt and pepper. Stir ten minutes, and add the water, boil- 
ing. Set for one hour where it will simmer ; then add the 
potatoes, peeled and cut in quarters. Simmer an hour long- 
er and serve. You can cook dumplings with this dish, if you 
choose. They are a great addition to all kinds of stews and 
ragouts. 

BAKED HAM. 

Take a medium- sized ham and soak twenty-four hours in 
cold water ; wipe and scrape clean ; make rather a stiff paste 
of rye meal and water, cover the ham entirely with the paste 
and bake in a moderate oven six hours. This is much nicer 
than boiled ham. 

ROAST PORK. 

Stuff the spare-rib with sage dressing, allow twenty min- 
utes for each pound, baste it with butter first : after that with 
its own drippings. Aj^ple sauce is served with it. 

BOILED HAM. 

Put the ham into a pot of cold water ; let it simmer 
slowly eight hours; leave in the water until cold; then peel 
off the skin. 

HAM AND EGGS. 

Ham should be fried in its own fat, well done. Take out 
of the spider, add lard, break the eggs one at a time, in a 
cup, put them in the fat and baste. 

VEAL CHOPS. 

Roll them in bread crumbs and fry in hot pork fat ; 
fringed white paper around the ribs adds very much to their 
looks.

27 
MUTTON. 

The best roasts are the leg, the saddle, aud the shoulder 
of mutton. To boil it, put into salted, boiling water and do 
not let it stop boiling until done. Boil one-quarter of an 
hour for each pound. Caper sauce should be served with it. 

LAMB. 

The best roasts are the fore and hind quarters. Roast 
lamb should be well done on the outside and pink within ; it 
must be served hot, with caper or mint sauce. A fore-quarter 
of lamb should be stuffed with a veal stuffing. It should be 
well seasoned with pepper and salt, and basted often. 

ROAST BEEF. 

To be properly roasted the meat should be placed on an 
iron rack in the pan, dusted over with flour and salt, then 
placed in a quick oven to brown the outside and retain the 
juices. After it has been well browned add a quart of water 
beneath the meat, place an onion in the water and let the 
meat cook slowly for an hour and a half. Just before taking 
the meat from the oven, make a paste cf flour and water, 
mixing ca ef ully to avoid lumps. Take the meat from the 
pan, remove the onion, and set the pan upon the stove. 
While the water is boiling add the paste gradually, stirring 
constantly until the gravy is of the right consistency. Salt 
and pepper to suit the taste. 

BOILED HAM. 

Scrape the ham and wash it clean. Place it in hot water 
and add one-half cup of sugar, one onion, one-half teaspoon 
of pepper. Boil all day. When done the meat will draw 
away from the bone. With a sharp knife cut off the rind 
and part of the fat, and place the ham in a baking pan. 
Pound together one-half cup of sugar and sprinkle over the 
ham. Stick in whole cloves and brown well in the oven. 

DRESSING FOR HAM SANDWICHES.

rack and then meat. Place in a very hot oven for a few min- 
utes to brown the flour ; add hot water enough to cover the 
bottom of the pan. In ten minutes baste with the gravy, 
dredge with salt, pepper and flour. Do this every fifteen 
minutes. Brown one side, then turn and brown the other. 

YOEKSHIRE PUDDING.

form, fasten it with t^kewers, sprinkle pepper and salt over it 
and cover with buttered paper. Baste well and often. Just 
before it is done sprinkle with flour and rub butter on it. 
Bake three hours.

ion juice, salt and pepper. Simmer two hours. Put one ta- 
blespoonful of butter in a pan, add one of flour. Stir until 
brown and smooth ; add the kidneys. 

A NICE WAY TO USE UP REMNANTS OF MEAT. 

Having freed the meat from all bone and fat, chop very 
fine. Place in a sauce-pan and add a piece of butter, water 
enough to make the mass soft, and season with salt and pep- 
-pe\ While this is slowly heating, toast several slices of 
bread, placa them over the surface of a heated platter. Mois- 
ten each slice of bread with a little hot water and spread up- 
on them the minced meat. Serve hot. This makes a good 
breakfast dish. 

FINGER SANDWICHES. 

One tablespoon of butter, a little flour, a little salt, boil 
ing milk enough to thicken, cook a little. Put by until thor- 
oughly cold, then add chopped chicken, lobster or ham. Cut

adding flour if the gravy is not thick enough. About twenty 
minutes before serving remove the cover and brown.

MACAEONI. 

Take half a pound of macaroni and stew in a saucepan 
of boiling water slightly salted, until soft and tender. When 
drained, put a layer in a baking- dish, and grate over it a lay- 
er of cheese, adding bits of butter. Put layer upon layer 
until the dish is filled, finishing with a layer of cheese and a 
half Clip of milk. Bake covered half an hour, then brown 
and serve in same dish. 

STRING BEANS. 

This delicious vegetable is rarely jjroperly cooked- 
When well prepared it is quite as healthful as peas. Take 
the pods as fresh and young as possible, and shred them as 
finely as a small knife will go through them, cutting them 
lengthwise, and, as it were, shaving them very thin. Put in- 
to salted boiling water and boil two hours. Then drain in a 
colander and serve with plenty of sweet butter, and they 
will be as delicate as peas. If one likes vinegar a little of it 
will improve the dish. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 
Take six tomatoes, pour boiling water over them so as 
to remove the skin ; put them in a saucej^an. Add butter, 
pepper and salt. Let them cook fifteen minutes. Bread 
crumbs may be added.

of this in smoking hot fat and fry same as doughnuts. 

GATEAU AU EIZ.

nearly done, add rice and milk and let it steam until the milk 
is absorbed sufficiently. When it is done, add the beaten 
egg- and flavoring. Butter a mould. Strew bread crumbs in 
the bottom of it. Put in the rice and bake one-half hour. 
Turn it out of the mould. Serve hot. 

TO FRY APPLES. 

Wash and wipe six large, fair, juicy apples that are not 
too tart ; remove cores with a sharp knife or apple corer ; 
cut the apple around in slices half an inch think; fry in hot 
butter until the slices are nicely browned on both sides ; 
sprinkle witn powdered sugar after removing to the dish in 
which they are to be served. A nice accompauiment for 
roast pork. 

TO MAKE CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Wash and pick a quart of cranberries and put them into 
a saucepan with a teacupful of water ; stew slowly, stirring 
often until they are as thick as marmalade ; they require at 
least one hour and a half to cook; when you take them 
from the fire sweeten them abundantly with white sugar ; if 
sweetened while cooking the color will be dark ; put into a 
mould and set aside to get cold. 

TO BOIL APPLES. 

Place a layer of fair-skinned Baldwins — or any nice va- 
riety — in the stewpan, with about a quarter of an inch of 
water. Throw on about one-half cup sugar to six good-sized 
apples, and boil until the apples are thoroughly cooked and 
the syrup nearly thick enough for jelly. After one trial no 
one would, for any consideration, have fair-skinned apples 
peeled. The skins contain a very large share of the pictous 
— jelly-making — substances, and impart a flavor impossible 
to obtain otherwise. A wise housekeeper, instead of throw- 
ing away the skins and cores of sound pie apples would use 
them for jelly. A tamblerful of the richest sort can thus be 
obtained from a dozen apples. Boil the skins, etc., a few 
minutes, and strain. Add a little sugar to the liquid, and 
boil until right to turn into the tumbler.

KING OF WASHING POWDERS. 

I have used three of the principal W ashing Powders now 
sold at the stores, auJ I have thoroagaly tried SavaNa. It is 
certainly superior to any other Washing Powder. In my 
opinion it is the ''King of Washing Powders," aad just what 
housekeepers want. I <'aii do my washing in just half the 
time, and with le-s hard labor, by using S.wena. For all 
woolens, say blankets, flannels, uuderwear, etc., it has no 
equal. It thoroughly cleanses woolens with very litt'e rub- 
bing, ]' aving them soft and white, without shrinking, and 
without the least injury to the liands or clothes. House- 
keepers, try it. — Mrs. G. T. Louc^ef, Middletown, N. H.

FERTECT 




" I want some more." — Oliver Twist. 

This immortal remark of Oliver's was occasioned by the

Elastic ^^ Starch 



A great invention. Requires no cooking. 

Makes collars and cuffs stiff and nice, 

as when first bouo-ht new. 



This Starch is made entirely different from 
all other Starches, and is the only starch in 
the United States that is put up by men 
who have a practical experience in the 
laundry business. How to laundry linen 
has been kept a secret long enough, that 
can and should be done in every family. 
By using this Starch your Shirts, Cuffs 
and Collars, will be just as stiff and nice as 
when first bought new. A fcAV other advan ■ 
tages this Starch possesses over all other 
Starch is : It requires no cooking, keeps 
the iron from sticking and linen from blis- 
tering while ironing. The manufacturers 
offer one hundi-ed dollars in gold, if this 
Starch jnoves injurious to the finest of lin- 
en. 



J. C. Hubinger Bros' Co., are the inventors 
and originators of the ELi STIC STARCH. 
They didn't have to boiTow and steal the 
name and fame of their neighbors in order 
to sell this Starch. Beware of worthless 
imitations which have recently been put '. 

into the market to deceive the public. Be 
sure that the name ELECTRIC, cut of the ] 

flat-iron, and name of J. C. Hubinger Bros' ' 

Co., New Haven, Conn., is upon the package i 

without which it can not be genuine. Al-

hours. Do not squeeze it. Work it with a spoon or with

Cut out carefully with a large spoon, and put in saucers with 
cream, powdered sngar, and nutmeg to taste. It is better if 
set on the ice for an hour before it is brought to the table. 
Do not let it stand until the whey separates from the curd. 
Few people know how delicious this healthful and simple des- 
sert can be made, if eaten before it becomes tough and tart, 
with a liberal allowance of cream and sugar. There ar3 not 
many jellies and creams superior to it.

It is double the strength of any other, is tasteless, odorless, 

and makes the most transparent jelly, and it costs you 

less than any other. Read what Prof. Sharples,State 

Assayer of Massachusetts, says of it. 



[Letter] 
S. P. Sharpies, State Assay er, 18 Broad St. 

Boston, Jan. 9, 1890. 
Messrs. John A. Andrews & Co.: 

Gentlemen — I have made a careful examination of the 
four sampltjs of gelatine submitted to me in unbroken packa. 
ges. These were mai'ked : 

Boston Crystal Gelatine. 
Nelson's Improved Brilliant Gelatine. 
James Chahners' Sous' Transparent Gelatine. 
Cox's Patent Refined Sparkling Gelatine. 
As a result of this analysis, I find that the Boston Crys- 
tal Gelatine is superior to all the others, in that it is absolute- 
ly free from taste and odor, and that it makes a more trans- 
parent jelly. It yields nearly double the amoant of jelly that 
the same weight of Cox's will produce, and considerably more 
than an equal weight of either of the others. 
Respectfully, 

(Signed, S. P. Sharple:;.

them stand all night. Li the morning drain on a sieve, and 
dry them in a cloth. To each quart of cider vinegar put one- 
half ounce of whole black pepper, the same of ginger and all- 
spice, and one ounce of mustard seed, — add onions if agreea- 
ble. "When this pickled vinegar boils up, throw in the cu- 
cumbers, and make them boil as quiqkly as possible for three 
or four minutes — no longer. Put them in a jar with the boil- 
ing vinegar and cover closely. Made in this way your pick-

USEFUL HINTS. 

To prevent sleeplessness after drinking co£fee at night : 
Eat a pickle or lemon to counteract the effect. 

To remove ink from woolen fabrics, put on sugar imme- 
diately and let it absorb all it will, then brush off and put on 
more sugar until all the ink is absorbed. 

To take out iron stains, put on lemon juice and salt and 
lay in the sun. 

There is scarcely any ache to which children are subject 
so bad to bear as the earache. But there is a remedy never 
known to fail. Take a bit of cotton batting, put upon it a 
pinch of black pepper, gather it up and tie it, dip in sweet oil 
and insert into the ear. Put a flannel bandage over the head 
to keep it warm. It will give immediate relief. 

If onions are sliced and kept in a sick room they will ab- 
sorb all the atmospheric poison. They should be changed 
every hour. In the room of a small-pox patient they blister 
and decompose very rapidly, but will prevent the spread of 
the disease. Their application has also proved effectual in 
the case of snake bites. 

A Powerful Poultice. — Wounds made by rusty tools or 
nails, or by the teeth of dogs and ether animals, are not only 
very painful but generally quite dangerous. To allay the 
pain, extract the poison and hasten the healing process, there 
is nothing that we know of so wonderfully effective as raw, 
fat salt salt pork and onions, equal parts, chopped up togeth- 
er and applied in a thick layer either directly to the wound 
or first folded into a single layer of linen. Leave on until 
healed. Even a slice of raw salt pork, tied over the wound 
made by a rusty nail, will draw the inflammation all out, ren- 
der the flesh clear white, and heal up the injurj' quicker than 
any drug, known to us, will do it. This is the best use that 
can be made of fat pork, as we do not believe in its free in- 
ternal application, especially in summer. 

Stains upon Lixen and Cotton. — In nearly all cases, stains 
may be removed by means of chloride of lime, which sub-

stance is sufficiently common to be had of every druggist. 
It is applied thus : Dissolve about two teaspoonf uls of the 
chloride of lime in a quart of water; take another portion of 
water and make it perceptibly sour by the addition of white 
vinegar — the ordinary brown vinegar will do nearly as well ; 
now well wet the stained or discolored articles with the sour 
water, then put them into the solution of the chloride of 
lime ; perfect bleaching will then take place in f lom ten to 
twentv minutes ; in some instances the operation must be re- 
peated once or twice ; finally, well rinse in plenty of clean 
water. The omission of the vinegar is the chief reason why 
so many persons fail in their attempts to bleach w^th chlor- 
ide of lime. 

Cream of tartar rubbed upon soiled white kid gloves 
cleanses them well. 

Musty bottles or jars may be sweetened with lye or dis- 
solved soda. Let either remain in them a short time, then 
dry and scald them. They will not become musty if a little 
salt be kept in them. 

Relief from Burns. — To obtain quick relief from burns, 
apply a layer of common salt and saturate it with laudanum. 
Hold it in position a few hours with a simple wrapper. The 
smarting disappears almost immediately, and the sore gets 
well with incredible rapidity. 

Grease from Silk and Velvet. — Rub the spot on the silk 
or velvet lightly and I'apidly with a clean, soft cotton rag 
dipped in ether. Repeat the operation if necessary. Finish 
with a clean, dry cloth. Rub lightly and rapidly, or else a 
slight stain will be the result. We have known grease spots 
to be taken out of the most delicate colored silks in the way 
described. 

To Wash Blankets. — Have an abundance of hot water in 
which borax has been dissolved, and a small quantity of Old 
Reliable soap — never use soap with rosin in it, as rosin al- 
ways hardens the fibre of wool. Put the ends into the wash- 
er, and then put in the blankets after all the dirt has been

removed, wring into another tub of hot suds, and from that 
wring into a tub of hot bluing water ; wring from this and 
hang at once in the open air to dry. If the water is abun- 
dant and soft, and you use this soap, blankets thus washed 
will not shrink^and will be as soft and fleecy as when they 
came from the store. 

To Relieve a Cough. — For a dry, hacking cough, two or 
three times a day take a little pinch of salt, let it dissolve 
slowly on the tongue and swallow. 

Another : Take five cents' worth of pulverized licorice 
extract and ground flaxseed ; mix together, put a little in a 
cup ; add strauied honey to sweeten well, steep in hot water 
till licorice is dissolved. Take a good dose of it as often as 
the cough is troublesome. It is a sure, safe, speedy relief. 
Try it once. 

For sick headache : Two teaspoonfuls of finely pulver- 
ized charcoal in half a glass of water. 

To Restore Old Crape. — Skimmed milk and water, with 
a bit of glue in it, made scalding hot, is excellent to restore 
old rusty black Italian crape. If clapped and pulled dry,like 
muslin, it will look as well or better than new. 

To Clean Flat Irons. — Beeswax and salt will make rusty 
flat irons as clean and smooth as glass. Tie a lump of wax 
in a rag and keep it for that purpose. When the irons are 
hot, rub them first with the wax rag, then scour them with a 
paper or cloth sprinkled with salt. 

To Clean Black Cashmere. — Wash in hot suds, with a 
little borax in the water ; rinse in bluing water — very blue — 
and iron while damp. It will look equal to new. Or, brush 
the article to be cleaned, and then wash in clear, cold water, 
and a handful of common washing soda, dissolved : use no 
soap or warm water. Iron on the wrong side while damp. 

To Wash Calico. — Make flour starch as for ordinary 
starching, being sure that it is entirely free from lumps. 
This, of course, can be guarded against by straining the 
starch. Add enough to the clean water in which the gar- 
Old Reliable Soap is Strictly Pure.

ments are to be washed to make it a little soft and a little 
slippery to the hand. Do not use soap, nor let the fabrics 
lie or soak in the water, but wash them out quickly. Add a 
little of the starch in the same way to the rinsing water, 
wring dry, and hang up without more starch. Black calico 
or cambric dresses washed thus will look nearly as fresh as 
new, and so of all colors ; the only precaution needed is not 
to get too much of the Ftarch in the wash water. Practice 
will soon teach this.
