We may live without friends ; we may live without books ;

PREFACE 



Cooking is an art which is capable, more than any other, of 
ministering to the comfort and enjoyment of hfe. It is not sur- 
prising, therefore, that from the earhest times great attention and 
study have been bestowed upon its cuhivation. 

The cook book made its appearance among the first Hspings 
of Hterature. Archistratus, who was the guide of Epicurus in his 
pleasures, and enjoyed the reputation of inventing made dishes 
first, attempted to pursue, for the use of posterity, the rules he 
successfully followed in preparing feasts for the philosophers or 
statesmen who ate his fish done in oil and wine and fragrant herbs. 
His task was a comparatively easy one ,as the variety of food — 
meat or vegetable — that found its way to the table of the Greeks 
of his time was by no means great, and the field widened with 
each of his successors, as wealth, refinement, and commerce in- 
creased the wants of men, at the same time they afforded oppor- 
tunities for supplying them. 

In our own language there were cook books before Chaucer 
sung, or Tyndal translated the Bible, and with each generation 
they have increased in number and improved in quality. 

It is not pretended that they can make good cooks give that 
skill and knack which are in part almost genius, and in part the 
result of early training and careful practice. There are rules, 
however, which it may require skill to follow, but which, if fol- 
lowed, will prepare for the table dishes which will gratify the 
appetite and please the palate, without offending the stomach. 

It has been the aim of cook books to gather these rules as 
the results of the experience of those who were at the time most 
celebrated for the mastery of their art ; and the ladies of the First 
Presbyterian Church of Youngstown offer to the public this their 
contribution to kitchen literature. All the receipts are known to 
be good, as they are used by the most experienced housewives. 
No pains have been spared to make this book meet the needs of 
the time, and it is confidently believed that it is without any serious 
faults, either in what it offers, or in what it omits, in the way of 
rules for the guidance of cooks. It has been a work involving 
great expenditure of time and labor, and the compilers do not see 
wherein there is anything lacking, or they could have done better. 
They now offer it to housekeepers everywhere, asking for it a 
fair trial, and unhesitatingly promise no failures where the 
receipes are faithfully followed.

SOUPS 

REMARKS. 

Good Stock is the basis of all soups and gravies. When made 
in large quantities a stock pot is necessary, otherwise an enamelled 
kettle of fair proportions answers. 

Use the shin of beef, the knuckle of veal and breast of mutton 
or lamb. It is not necessary to have the best cuts of meat or fowl 
but it should always be fresh. Cut the meat into small pieces and 
crack the bone, use cold water and let stand for awhile on the back 
of the stove before starting to boil. Allow one quart of water 
to every pound of beef ; let simmer slowly for six to eight hours. 
As it boils, a scum will rise which should be removed. Strain oflf 
the stock and set away to cool ; when cold, remove the fat which 
forms a cake on the top of the stock. On this account stock should 
always be made the day before it is wanter. In cool weather it 
is well to make enough to last several days. In clear or cream 
soups use lamb, vear or chicken stock. All vegetables for soup 
should be boiled soft before adding to the soup. In using onions 
to saute them, first in a little butter, colors and adds to the flavor. 

Beef Stock. — Six pounds hind shin of beef, six quarts of 
cold water, ten pepper corns, ten cloves, one carrot, one turnip, 
two small onions, four pieces celery, a sprig of herbs and parsley, 
a tablespoonful of salt ; cook as for consomme letting it stand at 
least an hour before putting on stove. For thick soups bones 
or meat left from steaks or roasts may be used, being careful to 
remove all burned parts ; put about one pound of raw meat with it. 

Stock for Soup. — Have a large pot on the back of the stove 
— put in lean beef either after having been cooked or before — in 



6 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

the proportion of one pound of beef to one quart of water ; add 
pork rinds with all the fat taken off — this may cook slowly for 
two or three days — when cold, skim off all the fat and put into 
another vessel. This stock may be used for all soups in which 
meat broth is required. By adding for thickening either barley, 
rice, sage, macaroni or vermicelli, it will make any of these soups. 
— Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Consomme. — Four pounds hind shin of beef, three pounds 
knuckle of veal, a three pound chicken, six quarts of cold water, 
one carrot, one turnip, two onions, six stocks celery, twelve pepper 
corns, twelve cloves, a sprig of parsley, a bay leaf, a sprig of 
marjoram, thyme, one tablespoonful salt. Let this stand for two 
hours, then put on back of the stove allowing an hour to have it 
come to a boil. Then let it simmer gently for five hours, straining 
and squeezing out the juice from the meat, let it stand until cold, 
skim oft' all the fat, put a piece of tissue paper on it to absorb the 
remaining fat, clear the soup with one white of egg and shell to 
every quart of soup. Let it boil ten minutes stirring constantly 
until it comes to a boil, then pour in one-half cup of cold water, 
let it stand on the back of the stove ten minutes, strain it through 
a cloth or sieve. If you wish to keep the stock, pour into Mason 
jars. The natural fat on the top protects it. By a stock of celery 
it means a single piece. Always allow one quart of water to one 
pound of meat with bone and little fat for soup stock. 

Beef Soup. — Boil a soup bone about four hours. Then take 
out meat into a chopping bowl, put the bones into the kettle, slice 
very thin one small onion, six potatoes and three turnips into the 
soup ; boil until all are tender ; have at least one gallon of soup when 
done. It is improved by adding crackers rolled or noodles just 
before taking off. Take the meat that has been cut from the 
bones, chop fine while warm, season with salt and pepper, add one 
teacup of soup saved out before putting in the vegetables, pack 
in a dish and slice down for tea or lunch when cold. — Mrs. C. 
D. Arms. 

Tomato Stock. — One bushel tomatoes, three dozen green 
peppers (seeds removed), one peck of cooking onions cut all into 



SOUPS 7 

pieces. Put into a kettle — with tomatoes and onions — enough 
water to keep them from sticking to the kettle ; let them boil until 
thoroughly cooked, then strain ; put liquor on again removing all 
scum. Can in Mason jars, air tight. Use half and half with meat 
stock for soup. — Mrs. W. J. Sampson. 

Corn Soup. — Cover a small soup bone with two quarts of 
cold water, add the corn cut from four large ears, six medium 
sized tomatoes cut up, a half pint of lima beans ; let boil slowly 
three hours. One-half hour before dinner pour in one quart of 
milk, reserving a small quantity to mix with a tablespoon ful of 
flour, stir in to make the soup the consistency of cream ; add a 
little chopped parsley, pepper and salt. — Mrs. Mason Evans. 

Corn Soup. — Shank of veal, one onion, one dozen ears of 
fresh corn, one quart of rich cream, two tablespoonfuls of flour. 
Boil the veal the day before wanted ; the following morning skim 
off all the fat and set it on the fire. One hour before serving tie 
a small onion in a muslin bag and add it to the soup leaving it in 
long enough to flavor. Cut the corn from the ear, putting it in 
soup thirty minutes before serving, season with pepper and salt 
and the cream and flour ; let come to a boil stirring constantly. — 
Mrs. IV. S. Bonnell. 

Puree of Corn. — One-half dozen ears of corn grated, one 
and one-half pints of veal or chicken stock, one onion, one pint 
cream, a little flour to thicken, butter, pepper and salt. Boil corn 
in one cup of water until done ; then put through the colander 
into stock ; cut up onions and cook a little while in the stock. Put 
cream into sauce pan, let come to a boil, season with pepper, salt 
and butter. When stock is boiling, stir in a little thickening. 
Cook thoroughly, stirring all the time ; then strain through a fine 
sieve, — Miss Kate Arms. 

Tomato Soup. — One quart of tomatoes, one onion, two 
ounces of flour, four ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, two of salt, one-third of a teaspoonful of Cayenne pepper, 
three pints of water, one-half pint of milk. Boil tomatoes and 
onions in water for three-quarters of an hour. Have salt, pepper, 
sugar, butter and flour rubbed smoothly together like thin cream ; 



O THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

boil ten minutes boiling milk separately. When both are boiling, 
pour the milk into the tomatoes to prevent curdling; serve with 
squares of toasted bread. — Mrs. IV. J. Hitchcock. 

Puree of Tomatoes. — One quart of tomatoes, one quart of 
milk, one pint of water. Boil water and tomatoes together 
twenty minutes, then add the milk and one teaspoonful of soda ; 
let it boil up after adding milk and soda. Season as you do oyster 
soup with butter, salt and pepper. Pour through a collander into 
a tureen. — Miss Sally Arms. 

Black Bean Soup. — Soak one and one-half pints of beans 
in cold water over night. In the morning, drain off the water, 
wash the beans in fresh water and put into a soup kettle with four 
quarts of good beef stock from which all the fat has been removed ; 
set it where it will boil slowly but steadily till dinner or three 
hours at the least. Two hours before dinner, slice in an onion 
and a carrot; some think it improved by adding a little tomato. 
If the beans are not liked whole, strain through a colander and 
send to the table hot. — Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Black Bean Soup. — Two cups of black beans soaked over 
night. Boil slowly all the next morning, strain at noon and add 
one-half can of tomatoes, one large or two small onions and four 
cloves ; cook this until four o'clock, then add two strips of bacon, 
cook until six o'clock, strain, thicken if necessary, serve with 
slices of lemon in each dish. — Mrs. IV. S. Bonncll. 

Oxtail Soup. — Put into a kettle — with about one gallon of 
cold water and a little salt — two oxtails. Skim off the froth when 
the meat is well cooked, take out the bones and add a little onion, 
carrot and tomato. It is better made the day before using so that 
the fat can be taken from the top. Add vegetables the next day 
and boil an hour and a half longer. — Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Chicken Okra Soup. — Take two quarts of good veal or 
chicken stock, to this add one coffee cup of the light meat of cold 
chicken cut in dice, one cup of okra sliced thin, and one cup of 
tomato cut fine. Add these to the stock and cook for twenty 
minutes ; season with salt and pepper. 



SOUPS Q 

Noodle Soup. — Take a large shank of beef, pour over it more 
than sufficient cold water to cover letting it boil slowly until the 
meat falls to pieces or from five to six hours, removing the scum 
as It rises. Set it away to cool. The following day remove the 
fat and put the soup on the fire with two medium sized onions 
sliced fine ; pepper and salt to season ; let it cook thirty minutes 
and strain. From three to five hours before serving, beat to- 
gether two eggs until light and work into them with a pinch of 
salt— enough flour to make as stiff a dough as can be rolled out ; 
roll very thin and sprinkle with flour, let stand on the moulding 
board until about one-half hour before serving, when roll the 
dough into a close roll and slice down fine with a sharp knife. 
Shake the noodles apart well, put into the soup and boil from 
twenty to thirty minutes.— Mrs. Henry Wick. 

French Vegetable Soup.— To a leg of lamb, moderate size, 
take four quarts of water, of carrots, potatoes, onions, tomatoes, 
cabbage and turnips take a teacup each chopped fine; salt and 
pepper to taste. Let the lamb be boiled in this water, let it cool, 
skim off all the fat that rises to the top. The next day boil again, 
adding the chopped vegetables ; let it boil three hours the second 
Q\2i\.—Mrs. R. McMillan. 

Mock Turtle Soup.— Boil a calf's head with a sHce of ham 
until it falls to pieces, strain and set away to cool. The next day 
skim well, take a soup bunch of vegetables well boiled, strain, and 
mix with the calf's head liquor with a little of the meat from the 
head. Boil an hour before using. Take two tablespoonfuls of 
brown flour, moisten and stir into the soup before putting in the 
force meat and egg balls. After putting in the force meat balls, 
let it boil up and dish right away having in the tureen a gill of 
sherry wine, two hard boiled eggs cut in thin slices and two lemons 
cut in thin slices. 

To Make the Force Meat Balls.— Two ounces of veal, one 
ounce of pork, two ounces of cracker crumbs, salt, pepper and 
either parsley or summer savory to taste; one yolk of tgg, two

or the soup will be dark. Put in the cut okra with about one 
tablespoonful of flour, stir it constantly for five or ten minutes, 
put in your fried chicken, pour on enough boiling water sufficient 
to make your soup ; salt and pepper to taste, and after boiling hard 
for about fifteen minutes, set on the back of the stove and let 
simmer gently for one hour. Have ready some plain boiled rice 
seasoned only with salt ; put some into each plate before serving 
the gumbo. 

Chicken Soup. — Make a stock of one chicken, cut up the 
chicken and break the bones ; cover with cold water ; season with 
salt and pepper corns, one onion, one celery stock ; let stand one 
hour, then simmer slowly five hours, strain, cool and skim ofif fat,

a Dover egg beater to make the soup foam — and serve at once. 
Care must be taken not to boil the soup after the clams are added 
as it will curdle. — Miss Isahelle McCurdy. 



FISH 



REMARKS. 

In selecting fish care should be taken that the flesh is firm to 
the touch — that no impression is left by the fingers — the eyes 
bright, the gills red and the scales not easily rubbed ofif. 

If the flesh is flabby and the eyes sunken, the fish are stale. 

They should be thoroughly cleaned, washed and sprinkled 
with salt. Most kinds of salt fish should be soaked in cold water 
for twenty-four hours, the flesh side turned down in the water. 
To boil fish, soak them in a cloth and put in cold water with 
plenty of salt. Most fish will boil in thirty minutes. Before 
broiling fish, rub the gridiron with a piece of fat to prevent it 
sticking. Lay the skin side down first. 

Boiled Fish. — Fill the fish with a stuffing of boiled pork and 
bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper, sew in a cloth, put in 
cold water enough to cover, salt it, and if liked add three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar ; boil slowly for thirty minutes and serve with 
drawn butter or caper sauce. 

Baked Fish. — A four or five pound trout, one quart of to- 
mato pulp, one quart bread crumbs, a little less than a pint of 
onions chopped fine, four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, black 
pepper, Cayenne and salt to season, Worchestershire sauce two 
tablespoonfuls, anchovy sauce one tablespoonful. Mix tomatoes, 
bread crumbs, onions, butter, the sauces and seasoning together, 
stufif the fish and sew up. The remainder of the stuffing spread 
on the outside of the fish. Bake two hours. — Mrs. J. L. Wick. 

Baked White Fish. — Prepare a stuffing of fine bread 
crumbs, a little salt and pepper ; season with sage, parsley, pepper 
and salt. Fill the fish with the stuffing, sew it up, sprinkle the 
outside with salt, pepper and bits of butter, dredge with flour and 
bake one hour ; baste often. Serve with e^gg or parsley sauce.

Oven Broiled Fish.— After fish is properly cleaned, take 
out the bone. Begin at the tail and work towards the head, with 
your fingers work out the bone keeping fingers near the bone and 
pushing the flesh away. Put the skin side down on a piece of 
brown paper in a baking pan, sprinkle with salt, pepper and add 
a little butter. Bake, allowing ten minutes to the pound. When 
ready to serve, divide into pieces with pan-cake spoon. Lift from 
the pan leaving the skin sticking to the paper, add a little piece 
of butter to each piece and a little lemon and parsley. White fish 
is best— Mrs. G. S. Peck. 

Fish Stuffed with Oysters. — One tablespoonful of butter 
to a cup of cracker crumbs. Mix butter and cracker crumbs to- 
gether and season well with salt and pepper. Drain the liquor 
from one pint of o>sters and mix with the crumbs. Fill a two and 
a half pound fish with the oysters one by one. If there are any 
crumbs left over, press inside of the fish, sew up the fish, leave on 
the head and tail. After stuffing, skewer and tie with a cord in 
the shape of a letter S, sprinkle plentifully with salt, pepper and 
flour, score the back and put in thin slices of salt pork, have small 
pieces of pork in the bottom of the dripping-pan, lay on the fish 
and set in the oven to bake, allowing ten to fifteen minutes to the 
pound. 

To Broil Salmon. — The steaks cut from the center of the fish 
are best. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, spread on a little butter 
and broil over a clear but slow fire; pour over maitre d'hotel 
sauce and serve quite hot. 

Broiled Fish. — Clean, wash and thoroughly dry the fish, 
split down the back, rub wire broiler with butter, place on the 
fish and broil over clear fire — the inside exposed to the fire first, 
then the skin side. When nicely browned and thoroughly cooked 
through, place on a hot platter, season with salt, pepper and piece 
of butter, garnish with quarter lemons and parsley or serve with 
maitre d'hotel sauce. 

To Plank Fish. — A board for planked fish should be made 
of hard wood — oak is best — about eighteen inches long, twelve 
inches wide and two inches thick, and slightly hollowed in the 



l6 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

center to hold the fish. Put the plank in the oven until very hot ; 
split the fish down the center of the back, wash and clean well, 
sprinkle thoroughly on both sides with salt and pepper and place 
on the board skin side down. Baste often with melted butter. 
Time required for baking about one-half hour. Serve on the 
plank, garnish with parsley and sliced lemon. 

Fillets of White Fish. — Take a good sized white fish and 
after cleaning wipe dry, cut into pieces two inches by three inches 
large, season well with salt and pepper on both sides ; beat to- 
gether one egg and one-half cup of milk. Dip each piece into this 
mixture, then into very finely rolled and sifted bread crumbs. 
Place in a frying basket and fry in deep, hot lard until a rich 
brown ; garnish with parsley and sliced lemon and serve with sauce 
tartare. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Brook Trout. — Remove the intestines and fins — but not the 
head of the fish — wash and wipe dry. Place on a wire broiler and 
broil over a clear fire, turning often and taking care not to burn 
the fish. When done spread on a little partly melted butter ; 
squeeze over a little lemon juice, and a sprinkling of chopped 
parsley. Season with salt and pepper. Serve very hot. 

To Boil Salt Mackerel. — Soak for twenty-four hours, then 
pour over it cold water, set on the fire and as it commences to boil 
take it off ; drain and serve with drawn butter. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 

To Broil Salt Mackerel. — After soaking sufficiently, hang 
up over night to drain ; broil slowly the skin side down ; sprinkle 
with pepper and lay pieces of butter over the top. Serve hot. — 
Mrs. J. M. Bonnell. 

Smelts Fried. — Scrape carefully with a knife, wash in salt- 
water, drain, and dry each one separately with a towel ; beat up one 
egg with three tablespoonfuls of milk, dip each smelt into this, 
then into cracker meal well salted and peppered, place a few at a 
time in a wire basket and fry in deep, hot lard until a light brown, 
drain in the colander or on heavy brown paper, cover hot platter 
with a napkin, arrange smelts on this, garnish with quarter lemons

three pounds will make a good sized chowder) cut it into pieces 
(larger squares than the pork), lay enough of these on the pork 
to cover well, then a layer of potatoes, next a layer of Boston 
crackers split, on this pepper and salt. Above this put a layer of 
pork and repeat the order given above until the materials are all 
exhausted. Let the top layer be buttered crackers ; pour on boiling 
water until covered and cover the kettle. Keep boiling half an 
hour ; five minutes before dinner, dredge well with flour and pour 
on a pint of milk. This will make the genuine Rye beach fish 
chowder.— il/;'.y. C. H. Gilman.

SHELL FISH 



REMARKS. 



Oysters are in season from September to May, but clams are 
considered good the year around. All shell fish should be 
strictly fresh. In choosing lobsters take the tail and pull it away 
from the body. If it is elastic and springs back, the lobster is 
fresh. Crabs should be alive when cooked to insure their freshness. 

Oysters on the Half Shell — Scrub the shells thoroughly 
and open by pushing a short knife blade around the edge of the 
shell and prying it open ; remove half the shell and carefully loosen 
the oyster from the other half ; drain off the liquor and remove any 
pieces of shell that might have broken in the opening; fill plates 
with finely chopped ice and place from four to six oysters on each 
plate, according to size. Serve a quarter of lemon on each plate 
and pass horse-radish, Oscar or mignonette sauce, also thin slices 
of spread brown bread and butter. 

Oyster Cocktail. — Drain the oysters in a colander, and for 
eight medium sized oysters, take two teaspoonfuls of home-made 
catsup, two teaspoonsful of lemon juice, one teaspootiful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, one-fourth of a teaspoonful of grated horse- 
radish, three drops of tobasco sauce and one-half teaspoonful of 
salt. Mix well together, thoroughly chill and serve in cocktail 
glasses. This amount will only serve one person. . 

Stewed Oysters — Take one quart of liquid oysters, put the 
liquor (a teacupful for three) in a stew pan and add half as much 
more water, salt, a good bit of pepper, a teaspoonful of rolled 
cracker for each. Put on the stove and let it boil; have your 
oysters ready in a bowl ; the moment the liquor boils, pour in all 
your oysters, say ten for each person, or six will do. Now watch 
carefully and as soon as it begins to boil take out your watch, 



20 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

count just thirty seconds and take your oysters from the stove. 
You will have your big dish ready with one and one-half table- 
spoonfuls of cream or milk for each person. Pour your stew on 
this and serve immediately. Never boil an oyster in milk if you 
wish it to be good. — Dchnonico. 

Fried Oysters — Take large oysters, wash and drain, dip them 
into flour, put into hot frying pan with plenty of lard and butter, 
season with salt and pepper, fry brown on both sides. Fried in 
this way are similar to broiled oysters — Miss Belle Robbins. 

Fried Oysters. — Drain the oysters and cover well with finest 
of cracker crumbs, season with salt and pepper, let them stand 
one-half hour, then dip and roll again in the meal ; fry brown in 
a good quantity of lard and butter. — Mrs. Mary Bentley. 

Panned Oysters — Arrange in a dripping pan rounds of deli- 
cately toasted bread, pour over each piece just enough of the 
oyster liquor to moisten. Onto each piece of toast put as many 
oysters as it will conveniently hold. Sprinkle with pepper and salt 
and small piece of butter ; roast in a quick oven until oysters begin 
to shrivel, add a little melted butter and serve quite hot in the 
tins they are roasted in. 

To Roast Shelled Oysters. — The large oysters are prefer- 
able for roasting. Use those that are fresh and unopened ; scrub 
and wash with a brush the shells well, then lay in baking pan 
deep side of shell down and roast in a quick oven or on the top of 
the stove until the shells crack open. Remove the upper half of 
the shell, season oysters with salt, pepper and a little hot, melted 
butter and serve immediately as they soon become cold. 

EscALLOPED Oysters — Take three pints of fresh oysters, have 
a pudding dish buttered, sprinkle the bottom with crackers rolled 
fine, then put in a layer of the oysters, sprinkle salt and pepper 
over them, then cracker crumbs and small pieces of butter, con- 
tinuing to do this until all the oysters are used, having cracker 
crumbs and butter on the top. Bake three-quarters of an hour in 
a brisk oven. — Mrs. M. I. Arms. 



SHELL FISH 21 

EscALLOPED Oysters — Put a layer of bread crumbs in baking 
dish, then a layer of oysters, then small pieces of butter and sprinkle 
of salt, and so on until the pan is full. Beat one egg light, 
add enough cream to make one cupful and pour on the top after 
the dish is full ; have a layer of crumbs on top ; use plenty of 
butter and all the liquor of the oysters. — Miss Caddie Boris. 

To Broil Oysters — Select good sized oysters that are fresh, 
drain in colander, dip each one in melted butter, place in a fine 
wire broiler and broil over a clear fire, season with salt, pepper 
and more melted butter. Serve hot on slices of toast slightly 
buttered and dip for a second only in hot water. — Mrs. Henry 
Wick. 

Oyster Pot Pie. — Have ready nice, light raised biscuit 
dough cut into small squares, season the oysters well with butter, 
pepper and salt, thicken them with a little flour. Drop in the 
pieces of dough and boil until done. These may be baked in the 
oven in a pudding dish allowing the dough to brown on top. — 
Mrs. John McCurdy. 

Oyster Pie — Line a deep dish with pastry, fold a towel in the 
dish, put on the top crust and bake ; stew the oysters, add a little 
thickening and a well beaten egg. When the pastry is done, 
remove the top crust, take out the towel and pour in the oysters ; 
put the cover on and serve. Both pastry and oysters should be 
ready at the same time. — Mrs. Mason Evans. 

Oyster Pie — Allow one can of oysters for two pies, roll out 
yoar pastry and put in your pie pan or dish, then put in oysters 
and cut up a piece of butter — the size of an egg for each pie — into 
small pieces ; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle a table- 
spoonful of flour in each and roll out a top crust. Bake from 
three-quarters of an hour to one hour.— il/;'.y. H. B. Wick. 

Oysters on Toast — To one quart of oysters washed and 
drained, add ihret pint^ of milk, put in a kettle on the stove and 
stir it to prevent burning; have ready a tablespoonful of flour 
stirred smooth in cold milk or cream ; add this and season with 
pepper, salt and butter to taste. Cook a few minutes and pour 
over buttered toast on a platter. — Mrs. R. McMillan.

gradually into the batter ; take a spoonful of the mixture, drop an 
oyster into it and fry in hot lard, let them be light brown on both 
sides. Clams can be used instead of the oysters. 

Oyster Croquettes — Take the hard end of the oysters, leav- 
ing the other end in nice shape for a soup or stew ; scald them, 
then chop fine and add an equal weight of potatoes rubbed through 
a colander. To one pound of this add two ounces of butter, one 
teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper, half a teaspoonful 
of mace and one-half gill of cream ; make in small rolls, dip in Qgg 
and grated bread and fry in deep lard. — Mrs. W. J. Hitchcock.

Steamed Clams. — Scrub clams well in several waters, let 
them stand in a big pan of water with a handful of salt, put in 
an iron pot with a cup and a half of cold water, a pinch of salt 
and a little pepper ; cover, let boil about six minutes after it 
begins to boil. Place clams whose shells have opened onto a 
hot platter, serve with seasoned melted butter in a cup with a 
little of the clam broth. 

Boiled Lobster. — Boil small live lobster in boiling water for 
twenty minutes; when cold, open and serve in shells with either 
French or mayonnaise dressing.

MEATS 



REMARKS. 

In selecting beef choose that of a fine, smooth grain, of a bright 
red color and white fat. 

The flesh of good veal is firm and dry and the joints stiff. 

The flesh of good mutton or lamb is a bright red with the 
fat firm and white. 

If the meat of pork is young, the lean will break on being 
pinched; the fat will be white, soft and pulpy. 

Roast Beef. — The best pieces for roasting are the sirloin 
and standing rib. Pour a very little water into the dripping pan 
with which baste the meat frequently while roasting; also turn 
it that all sides may cook alike; roast in a quick oven allowing 
fifteen minutes to each pound; when done, take up the meat, 
pour off the fat from the gravy and thicken with a little flour 
mixed smooth with a little cold water, let it boil and send to the 
table in a gravy dish. Do not salt the roast until a short time 
before removing from the oven as salt extracts the juice. Some 
prefer the beef basted only with the beef drippings. 

Yorkshire Pudding to Serve with Roast Beef. — Three 
eggs well beaten, to which add nine tablespoonfuls of flour, a 
small teaspoonful of salt and beat up with milk until about the 
consistency of thick cream. This batter pour into the pan in 
which the beef has been roasted having enough grease (which 
must be hot) to bake it. Bake in a quick oven.— Mr.?. Wm. 
Bonnell. 

Boiled or Stewed Beef. — Take a piece of beef from the 
shoulder weighing five or six pounds and cut into pieces as large 
as your fist; put into a kettle and a little more than cover with 
cold water ; when it comes to a boil, set it back on the stove and 
let simmer gently for about three hours keeping it covered, 
when the meat is tender, thicken the gravy with butter rubbed 



28 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

smooth with a Httle flour until the consistency of thick cream ; 
place meat on a platter and pour gravy over. 

Beef Steak Broiled. — Choose sirloin or tenderloin steaks 
from one to two inches thick, lay on a gridiron and broil over a 
clear fire ; when done put on a warm platter with plenty of butter, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Beef steak should be eaten as soon 
is cooked to be in perfection. Thin slices of salt pork or break- 
fast bacon broiled and served with the steak is an improvement. 
— Mrs. G. B. Woodman. 

Beef Steak Fried. — Steaks for frying should be cut thinner 
than for broiling ; put part lard and part butter into a skillet, let 
it get very hot, put in the steak, season with salt and pepper and 
let fry until nicely browned ; lay on a hot platter and make a 
gravy to pour over the meat by pouring into the frying pan a 
little hot water ; slice raw onions thin, lay on the steak and pour 
the hot gravy over them and serve immediately. — Adrs. W. S. 
Bonnell. 

Beef Steak with Oysters. — Broil a sirloin or tenderloin 
steak, season, take one quart of oysters, drain off all the liquor, 
put them int a stew pan with half of a small cup full of butter, 
or less butter and a little sweet cream, salt and pepper enough to 
season ; let them boil and turn them over the steak on the platter. 
Oysters broiled and laid on the steak are very nice. — Mrs. M. 
I. Arms. 

A New England Boiled Dinner. — Select a thick piece of 
corn beef from the round of shoulder weighing from six to eight 
pounds. Wash in cold water and put over the fire in a large pot 
with sufficient cold water to cover it three or four inches. Set 
the pot where its contents will slowly reach the boiling point and 
boil very gently for four hours from the time it is first placed on 
the fire. After the meat is put on to cook, peel a dozen medium 
sized potatoes, four turnips, scrape four carrots and four pars- 
nips ; trim and wash a firm head of cabbage, cut its stalk out 
without breaking and bind with a tape to keep whole while cooking. 
As fast as the vegetables are prepared, lay them in cold water 
until needed for cooking. If onions are used, they should be 
boiled in a separate sauce pan. When the meat begins to boil, 
the scum which rises to the top should be carefully skimmed oflf 



MEATS 29 

and a medium sized red or green pepper put into the pot. The 
pot should be large enough to hold both meat and vegetables. 
The vegetables are to be added to the meat in proper succession 
allowing time for each kind to cook ; carrots, parsnips and 
turnips about two hours ; cabbage and onions one hour ; potatoes 
one-half hour. When the boiled dinner is cooked, the meat is 
placed in the middle of a large platter and the vegetables ar- 
ranged around. A piece of salt pork is sometimes boiled with 
the beef. 

Rolled Beef. — Remove the bone and fat from a sirloin 
steak cut about one inch thick, lay out flat and spread with a 
rich bread stuffing with a few scraps of any kind of cold meat 
and a very little salt pork chopped fine ; roll carefully to pre- 
vent dressing from pushing out at the sides, tie firmly with a 
cord, dredge well with flour, salt and pepper ; have a little hot 
fat in the skillet, put the roll into this turning until all sides are 
brown ; then remove to a baking pan, slice one onion, one small 
carrot very thin, two tomatoes cut up and a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley ; lay on top of the beef, add a little stock to the 
pan and roast slowly about two hours, basting often. When 
done, if gravy is not thick enough, add a little flour ; remove the 
string before serving. 

Planked Steak. — Broil a sirloin steak two and one-half 
inches thick. Have ready, cooked and hot, one dozen potatoes 
mashed, one can of peas, one dozen small onions and three car- 
rots. Place this steak on a hot plank and pipe the potatoes around 
it through a pastry tube, then put the other vegetables inside the 
ring of potato. Brush over the potatoes and onions with beaten 
yolks of eggs diluted in milk and set the whole into the oven 
long enough to reheat the potatoe and brown the edges delicately. 
Remove the plank from the oven, cover the edges with a napkin 
and serve on a platter at once. — Mrs. R. McCurdy. 

Beef a la Mode. — Take a round of beef, remove the bone 
from the middle, also all the gristle and tough parts about the 
edges ; have ready one-half pound of fat salt pork cut into 
strips as thick and long as your finger, prepare a nice dressing 
the same as for stufling a turkey. With a thin, sharp knife make 
perpendicular incisions in the meat about one-half an inch apart, 
thrust into them the pork and work in with them some of the 



30 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

dressing ; proceed thus until the meat is thoroughly plugged. Put 
it into a baking pan with a little water at the bottom, cover tightly 
and bake slowly four hours. Then uncover and spread the rest 
of the dressing over the top and bake until a nice brown. After 
taking up, thicken the gravy and pour over the beef ; it should 
be sliced horizontally ; it is good either hot or cold. — Mrs. John 
McCurdy. 

A LA MODE Beef. — Three pounds of beef, raw, chopped fine, 
two slices of bread chopped fine, two eggs well beaten, one cup of 
milk, one tablespoonful of black pepper, one tablespoonful of 
salt, a piece of butter the size of an egg ; bake two and a half 
hours, slice and eat cold. — Mrs. T. H. JVilsoii. 

Beef Omelet. — Three pounds of beef, three-quarters pound 
suet chopped fine, salt, pepper and a little sage, three eggs, six 
Boston crackers rolled ; make into a roll and bake. — Mrs. W. S. 
Mattheivs. 

Beef Omelet. — Three pounds beef chopped fine, three eggs, 
one pint bread crumbs, one tablespoonful of salt, one tablespoonful 
pepper, one tablespoonful butter, sage to taste. Mix together and 
mold into a loaf, place in a pan with hot water enough to keep 
from burning and stufif bits of butter around it ; cover until nearly 
done, then let it brown. Bake about two hours. — Mrs. E. L. 
Kanengeiser. 

Beef Brawn. — Take a nice boiling piece of beef, boil until 
quite tender ; when cool, remove the bone, chop fine, strain the 
liquor in which the beef has been boiled, let it stand until cool, 
skim off the fat and add to the liquor the chopped beef ; season 
with salt, pepper and a little butter and sage or sweet marjoram 
if liked. Let it simmer until almost dry, press into a dish, when 
entirely cold slice. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 

Si'iCED Beef. — Take a piece of round and cut out the bone; 
tie a string around it to keep it firm ; take four ounces of salt- 
petre finely powdered and rub into the meat ; put into a crock, 
cover and let stand two days. Next rub thoroughly with salt, 
return to the crock and let it stand eight days ; then take an 
ounce of powdered mace, a grated nutmeg, one ounce pepper, 
one-half ounce of cloves light weight. Miz these spices well to- 
gether with one pound of brown sugar ; rub this thoroughly 
through the beef, which will be ready to cook the next day. 



MEATS 31 

Then fill the opening with herbs, take one-half pound of beef suet, 
flatten it by pounding with the rolling pin, lay it in a broad earthen 
pan with the suet under and over the meat. Over this put a shee^ 
of white paper and cover with a plate, set it in a hot oven and 
cook five hours or until it is thoroughly cooked. It is excellent 
cold. — Mrs. IV. J. Hitchcock. 

MiGNONS OF Beef. — Cut a pound of well trimmed tender- 
loin into five slices, remove the skin and press into round shapes ; 
brush with oil or melted butter and broil about six minutes on 
both sides ; season, salt, pepper, butter and chopped cress. Place 
on a platter around a pile of small potato balls cooked a la maitre 
d'hotel. — Mrs. IV. J. Sampson. 

Devilled Beef. — Take slices of cold roast beef, lay them 
on hot coals and broil ; season with pepper, salt, and serve while 
hot with a small lump of butter on each piece. — Mrs. H. B. Wick. 

Hamburg Steak. — Put through a meat grinder small pieces 
of beef, either from the round or shoulder ; when ground, to one 
pound of meat add one teaspoonful of salt and one-half tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; form into small cakes with the hand and either 
broil on both sides over a clear fire or saute in half lard and 
butter. Have some nicely browned sauted onions, place a spoonful 
on each meat cake and serve very hot. 

To Cook a Fillet of Beef. — Procure a nice fillet of beef, 
sear the outside in a hot pan to retain the juices. Thin slices of 
salt pork may be laid over the beef and baste with a cup of beef 
stock in the bottom of the pan. Half an hour is sufficient time if 
oven is hot as should be. Serve with mushroom sauce. — Mrs. J . 
H. McEwen. 

Mushroom Sauce. — Put a tablespoonful of butter in a 
sauce pan. Stir in a tablespoonful of flour and cook. Add half 
a cup of beef stock and a part of the juice from a can of mush- 
rooms. Add pepper and salt and a few drops of lemon juice. Put 
in mushrooms and simmer a few minutes. — Mrs. J. H. McEzven. 

Ground Beef for Breakfast. — Procure a good round steak 
and cut in pieces and put through a meat grinder ; put this into a 
skillet over a hot fire and stir constantly until all particles are 
just cooked enough to not be rare; season with a little salt and 
pepper and a small piece of butter and serve very hot ; if allowed 
to stand will become tough and hard. 



32 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Hash. — Chop fine cold boiled or roast beef, veal or mutton ; 
take out any particles of gristle ; pare and cut into small dice cold 
boiled potatoes; mix together half .and half, put into a porcelain 
lined skillet, season well with salt and pepper, almost cover with 
cream and let simmer slowdy fifteen or twenty minutes or long 
enough for the cream to thicken ; add a small piece of butter just 
before taking from the fire. A little stock can be used instead of 
the cream. Let fry to skillet and serve brown scrapings with it. 
It is a mistaken idea that good hash can be made from any kind 
of meat. 

Corn Beef Hash. — Proceed the same as for beef hast, using 
the corn beef. 

To Cure Beef or Tongues. — Six pounds salt, three pounds 
sugar, one-quarter pound saltpetre, four gallons of water. Scald 
the mixture, skim it, and when cold put the beef into it. The 
round to be used for drying should be taken out at the end of 
three weeks and either smoked or dried. The tongues can be 
left in for a longer time. — Airs. J. G. Butler. 

Smoked Tongue. — Soak them over night, if very hard, 
longer ; cover with water, boil slowly three or four hours or until 
tender ; peel ofT the skin while warm, when cold slice thin. 

Braised Tongue. — Take a fresh beef tongue and make a 
hole in the little end of it, put a cord through and draw the big 
and little ends of the tongue together and tie firmly. Put the 
tongue in a kettle and cover with sfood rich stock, season with 
pepper and salt and boil slowly until tender (about two hours.) 
Set ofif the stove and let the tongue lay in the stock until cold. 
(The stock will do for soup.) Then skin the tongue, put in a 
kettle with a pint of very rich beef stock, one gill of Madeira 
wine, one cup of onion, carrot and a stock of celery (chopped 
fine and fried in a teaspoonful of melted butter) and half a cup 
of ripe tomatoes. Let simmer slowly for one-half hour and 
serve. — Mrs. S. Stevenson. 

Dried Beef in Cream. — Shave the beef very thin, pour over 
it boiling water, let it stand for a few minutes ; pour this ofif and 
pour on good rich cream ; let it come to a boil ; if you have no 
cream use milk and butter and thicken with a very little flour. 
Season with pepper and serve on toast or not, as you like. — Mrs. 
W. S. Bonnell. 



MEATS 33 

Frizzled Beef. — Shave dried beef very thin, put into a 
frying pan when good and hot ; put in the beef and shake or stir 
until heated through ; season with pepper. Serve in this way, or 
just before serving beat one egg Hght and stir in. 

To Cure Tongues. — Scald together three quarts salt, one of 
molasses, one of brown sugar and two ounces of saltpetre in six 
quarts of water; strain into a jar; when cold, wash and trim your 
tongues and drop them into the brine keeping them covered by 
putting a plate over them. Let them remain at least six weeks 
in the brine, when they may be taken out, wiped dry and strung 
ready for smoking. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

Devilled Kidney. — Prepare two beef kidneys, cut up and 
parboil one hour. In an iron frying pan fry four slices of bacon and 
one onion until all are well browned; then put in the pieces of 
kidney and brown that also ; season with a teaspoonful of salt 
and a little thyme and a pinch of powdered nutmeg; dredge all 
well with flour, add one cup of tomato, one cup of water, cover 
closely and simmer slowly one hour. — Nezv Orleans. 

To Devil Meats. — To "devil" anything is to make it very 
hot by means of cayenne pepper, black pepper, mustard, etc., as 
well as by fire. Cold meat is devilled by sprinkling it with mixed 
cayenne, black pepper and salt, then rubbing the meat with 
French mustard and making it hot through over a grid-iron. 
Sometimes the pepper, etc., is mixed with butter, the meat cut 
in gashes and the mixture inserted in the gashes, then grilled. 
Drum sticks of fowls should be cut in gashes long-ways, the 
mixture inserted — say French mustard and cayenne — then but- 
tered and grilled. 

VEAL 

Roast Veal. — Take a loin of veal, make a stuffing the same 
as for roast turkey, fill the flank with the stuffing and secure it 
firmly onto the loin ; rub the veal with salt, pepper and a little 
butter, put it into a pan with a little water; while roasing, baste 
frequently, letting it cook until thoroughly done, allowing two 
hours for a roast weighing from six to eight pounds ; when done, 
remove the threads before sending to the table. Thicken the 
gravy with a little flour.

thin slices of veal, then pound until one-quarter inch thick, trim 
in pieces 2H by 4 inches, chop the trimming fine with a square 
inch of salt pork ; for each two birds add half as much more 
bread crumbs as you have chopped meat. Season high with 



MEATS 35 

salt, pepper and sweet herbs, lemon juice, paprika and onion 
juice ; moisten with a little hot water, add an egg beaten, spread 
the mixture on each slice of veal nearly to the edge, roll up tightly 
and facten well with tooth pick, dredge with flour, salt, pepper 
and saute a golden brown in butter, then half cover with cream 
and cook very slowly until tender. Serve on toast, garnish with 
toasted points, lemon and parsley. 

Veal Cheese. — Take equal quantities of sliced boiled veal 
and sliced boiled tongue ; pound each separately in a mortar adding 
butter as you do so; mix them in a stone jar, press it hard and 
pour on melted butter; keep it covered in a dry place. When 
cold, cut in thin slices for tea or lunch. 

Scotch Gallops. — Cut veal into thin slices, beat with a 
pounder, dip them into yolk of egg and fry brown ; have ready

black or white pepper, one grated nutmeg ; chop the meat all very 
fine and mix the ingredients thoroughly, put in a dripping pan 
with a little water, make it into a loaf, bake about two hours 
basting it constantly; leave it to get cold and slice as head- 
cheese. — Mrs. R. IV. Taylor. 

Broiled Calves' Liver with Bacon. — Procure a nice calf's 
liver, wash and cut in thin slices, broil over a clear fire with thin 
slices of breakfast bacon ; season with butter, salt and pepper. — 
Mrs. W. Scott Bonnell. 

Veal Hash. — Take a teacupful of boiling water in a sauce

36 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

of cold water, and let it boil five minutes ; add one-half tea- 
spoon of black pepper, as much salt and two tablespoonfuls of

mix with half as much stale bread crumbs, put into a pan and 
pour the gravy over it ; then let it simmer ten minutes. Serve 
this on buttered toast. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 

Fillet of Veal (Roasted in the Pot). — Remove the bone 
and fill the cavity with a force-meat made of bread crumbs, a 
very little salt pork, chopped fine, sage, pepper, salt and ground 
cloves ; lay in the pot a layer of slices of salt pork, put in the 
fillet, fasten with skewers, coover in the same manner, pour over 
a pint of good stock, cover down close and let it cook slowly two

Veal Steak. — Beat them until tender, then broil over clear, 
hot coals until a nice brown on both sides, season with salt, 
pepper and butter, send to the table while hot. A gravy made 
by stewing in a little hot water pieces of veal with a few oysters

Breaded Veal Chops with Tomato Sauce. — Have the 
chops cut one-half inch thick from the loin of veal, dip into 
beaten egg and then into finely sifted bread crumbs, saute in half 
butter and half lard or sausage drippings. Serve with tomato 
sauce, poured over on hot platter. 

MUTTON AND LAMB 

Boiled Leg of Mutton. — Put on in cold water with a little 
salt, boil two hours and a half; make a sauce of melted butter — 
a piece of butter the size of an egg stirred with a tablespoonful of 
flour well, then stir into it a pint of boiling water with a little 
parsley chopped fine ; put into a sauce tureen on the table and 
garnish the dish with boiled cauliflower and parsley.

pepper. 



MEATS 



37 



Haricot Mutton.— Loin chop, fry until brown, dredge with 
flour, put into boihng water, or if you have it, weak soup, cut 
carrots into small pieces, then simmer for two hours, season with 
pepper and salt. Steak cooked in the same wav is very nice. — 
Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Breast of Mutton and Green Peas. — Select a breast of 
mutton not very fat, cut it into small square pieces, dredge it 
with flour and fry a fine brown in butter; add pepper and salt; 
cover it with water and set it over a slow fire to stew until the 
meat is perfectly tender; take out the meat, skim off all the fat 
from the gravy and just before serving add a quart of young 
peas previously boiled with the strained gravy and let the whole 
boil gently until the peas are done. 

Mutton Chops. — Have them trimmed from fat and skin, 
dip each one into beaten egg, then in pounded cracker, fry in hot 
lard or drippings. It is still better to bake them very slowly in 
the oven. — Mrs. John McCurdy. 

Roast Lamb. — Choose a hind quarter of lamb, stuff it with 
fine bread crumbs, pepper, salt, butter and a little sage. Sew 
the flap firmly to keep in place, rub the outside with salt, pepper, 
butter, a little of the stuffing and roast two hours. Serve with 
mint sauce. 

Crown Roast of Lamb. — The loin and ribs of lamb are 
required for this roast; have the butcher split the bones between 
the chops, then trim each bone down to the fleshy part of the 
chop ; he should also cut off each bone to equal lengths, then form 
a circle of the chops and tie firmly together. Roast as you would 
a leg of lamb, basting frequently. When done, place on a hot 
platter, fill the center with green peas (previously cooked and 
seasoned with salt, pepper and butter), remove the string from 
the meat and cover each chop end with a paper frill. 

To Grill a Shoulder of Lamb. — Half boil it, score it and 
cover it with egg crumbs and parsley seasoned ; broil it over a 
very clear and slow fire or brown in an oven. Serve with tomato 
sauce. 

Breaded Lamb Chops. — Grate plenty of stale bread, season 
with salt and pepper, have ready some well beaten egg, have a 
spider with hot lard ready, take the chops one by one, dip into 



38 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

the egg, then into the bread crumbs, repeat it as it will be found 
an improvement; then lay separately into the boiling lard, fry 
brown and then turn, to be eaten with currant jelly or grape 
catsup. 

Broiled Lamb or Mutton Chops. — Cut the loin into chops, 
remove a part of the fat and broil ; season with salt, pepper and 
butter. — Mrs. J. M. Bonnell. 

PORK 

Roast Pork. — Procure a joint of fresh pork, score the skin 
in narrow strips ; prepare a stuffing of fine bread crumbs, pepper 
and salt, and make incisions between the ribs and fill them with 
the stuffing, rub the joint well with sage, pepper, salt and bread 
crumbs. It will require about three hours to roast. Skim the fat 
from the gravy, thicken with a little flour and serve in a gravy boat. 

To Roast Young Pig. — Should be about six weeks old and 
should be killed two or three days before cooking ; after thoroughly 
cleaning ; soak from one to two hours in weak salt and water and 
let it hang over night. Make a stuffing of fine bread crumbs 
seasoned with butter, salt, pepper and sage, fill the pig full and 
sew up ; fasten the legs to the side of the pig to give it a good 
shape, salt and pepper the outside and rub on a little melted butter ; 
baste often until done. They are nicer baked in a brick oven than 
a stove ; bake for three or four hours ; the skin when done should be 
of a rich brown color and crisp. — Mrs. Jonathan Warner. 

Spare Ribs Baked and Broiled. — Season well with salt and 
pepper, bake in a quick oven three-quarters of an hour, baste often 
while baking. After taking up the ribs, pour ofif the fat from 
the gravy and thicken with a little flour. If liked, sprinkle a little 
sage over before baking. To broil crack the bones and broil over a 
clear fire taking care that the fire is not hot enough to scorch them. 
— Mrs. M. Adelia Wick. 

Pork and Beans. — Take two pounds of side pork, not too 
fat nor too lean, to two quarts of marrow-fat beans ; put the beans 
to soak the night before you boil them in a gallon of milk-warm 
waterj after breakfast, scald and scrape the rind of the pork and 
put on to boil an hour before putting in the beans. As soon as 



MEATS 39 

the beans boil up, pour off the water and put on one gallon of 
fresh water ; boil until quite tender adding more water if necessary. 
Great care must be taken that they do not scorch. When nearly as 
stiff as mashed potatoes, put into a baking dish, score the pork and 
put in the center. Brown in the oven one hour. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

Pork and Beans. — Put the beans to soak in cold water the 
night before using; the next morning parboil them, strain out of 
that water into a crock, put a small piece of salt pork in the 
center, pepper well and pour on boiling water until covered. They 
will be baked ready to eat in five hours. They are much improved 
by staying in the oven all day. — Mrs. C. H. Gilman. 

Pork Chops or Tenderloin. — Cut thin and cook thoroughly ; 
broil or fry plain or dip into yolk of egg and bread crumbs. Season 
with salt and pepper. 

Sausage. — To ten pounds of ground meat, four ounces of salt, 
one of pepper, half an ounce of powdered sage. Grind the meat 
very fine, the tenderloin is best but a fresh ham mixed with the 
tenderloin makes it very nice. Pack well in a stone jar. — Grandma 
Wick. 

Broiled Pigs Feet. — Take the feet from young pigs, cut off 
the toes, single well, split and soak for twenty-four hours in good 
strong salt and water ; then scrape thoroughly ; boil until tender ; 
when cold, place on a wire gridiron and broil over a clear fire, sea- 
son with salt, pepper, butter and serve with quarters of lemon. 

Pigs Feet Hash. — Singe and scrape the feet, then wash clean 
and put them into salt and water to soak over night, then scrape 
again until they are perfectly clean and boil them till the meat 
falls from the bones ; chop with a knife, season with salt and 
pepper, pack in a crock and if the weather be cool it will keep 
some time. It can be sliced and eaten cold or put into a skillet 
and fried until brown. — Mrs. H. B. Wick. 

Pigs Feet Pickled. — Chop off the toes, soak over night in 
salt water; in the morning scrape well, boiling till tender; then 
take from the liquor, put into a croock, sprinkle with salt and to 
one dozen feet put two tablespoonsful of whole pepper, two grains 
of cloves and two of broken cinnamon ; while the feet are hot, cover 
with good, strong cold vinegar, cover and they will be ready for use 
in two or three days. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 



40 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Scrapple. — Clean and scrape a pig's head thoroughly, having 
previously removed the eyes, ears and the entire jaw, let stand in 
salt and water over night, then boil until the flesh falls from the 
bones and chop fine with a little sage, salt and pepper, and return 
to the liquor ; add enough sifted corn meal to thicken, simmer until 
of the consistency of soft mush — not too thick to pour; put it in 
pans, when cold and stiff, slice and fry. 



HAMS 



REMARKS. 

For boiling, always select an old, small ham. 

For broiling, choose one recently cured. Cold boiled ham 
should be cut as thin as possible, it is said so thin as to cover an 
acre. Grated ham is very nice on sandwiches. For luncheon, cold 
ham may be sliced very thin and rolled. 

Roast or Baked Ham. — Boil a good sized ham three hours. 
Then take off the rind or skin and put in dripping pan. Put over it 
one cup of sugar and one pint of vinegar and stick cloves into 
the ham. Bake one hour. — Mrs. W. S. Bonncll. 

To Boil Ham. — Clean a ham well, tie in a cloth, put into 
cold water, cover up tight, boil hard five hours, then let stand until 
perfectly cold, never taking off the cover until cold. This is 
nice sliced. — Mrs. Ann Hughes. 

Virginia Hams. — First wash well the hams in warm water; 
now place it in the boiler with say from eight to ten gallons of 
cold water ; at the commencement of cooking you will be careful to 
only simmer very slowly for the first hour, then after steadily and 
regularly boil until the ham is soft and well done. To cook thor- 
oughly a ten pound ham requires say four hours and other sizes 
in like proportion. Remove the skin while the ham is warm. If 
you do not find this good you need not blame me. Virginia hams 
should be kept ten days after boiling before slicing cold. — Scott. 

To Broil Ham. — Cut thin slices about one-quarter inch 
in thickness, trim carefully the outside edges, lay on a gridiron 
and broil ; while hot, sprinkle over it a little pepper and put 
pieces of butter on the top. 

To Render Lard. — Procure the finest of leaf lard, and after 
washing and scraping clean, cut into small pieces, put into a 
kettle with a very little water to prevent burning, let it cook slowly 



42 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

until the fat is entirely drawn out and the pieces are brown and 
crisp and sink to the bottom of the kettle ; strain carefully through 
a cloth, tie up and set away. 

Hog's Head Cheese. — Clean a hog's head thoroughly, boil 
until tender ; when it falls to pieces take out the bones, season with 
salt and pepper, press into a crock ; when cold slice. — Mrs. M. I. 
Arms. 

To Fry Salt Pork. — Salt pork, with as little lean as possible, 
is best; slice thin and dip each slice in flour fried to a delicate 
brown in a hot skillet ; serve at once. 

To Salt Ham or Shoulders. — For every one hundred 
pounds of ham, take six ounces of salt-petre, two quarts of mo- 
lasses and ten pounds of salt ; mix well together, rub the hams 
with the mixture thoroughly, let them stand three weeks, then turn 
over and rub again. They will soon be ready for use. 



POULTRY 



REMARKS. 

Young, plump and well fed but not too fat poultry are the 
best. The skin should be fine grained, clear and white, the breast 
full-fleshed and broad, the legs smooth. The birds must be heavy 
in proportion to their size. 

As regards duck and geese, their breasts must also be plump, 
their feet flexible and yellow. For boiling, white legged poultry 
must be chosen because when dressed their appearance is by far 
the most delicate. The greatest precaution ought to be taken 
to prevent poultry from getting at all tainted before it is cooked. 
It should be killed and dressed from eight to ten hours before 
cooking. Care must be taken to cook poultry thoroughly. 

Boiled Turkey. — Soak it in salt and water for an hour and a 
half to make it white ; make a stuffing of bread crumbs and about 
half the quantity of suet, a little parsley and a little lemon peel 
chopped fine ; scald the parsley in order to have it green ; put all 
of these into the breast, tie lightly in a cloth and boil ; a young 
turkey will boil in two hours, an older one will require, of course, 
a longer time. Garnish with parsley and lemon cut in slices. Serve 
with white sauce which is made as follows : 

Take one cup of butter and melt it and while in the sauce 
pan shake in three tablespoonsful of flour until well mixed, then 
add one quart of milk stirring all the time till it boils. — Mrs. 
Francis. 

Roast Turkey. — A turkey weighing not more than eight or 
nine pounds (young) is the best. Wash and clean thoroughly 
wiping dry as moisture will spoil the stuffing ; take one small loaf 
of bread grated fine, rub into it a piece of butter the size of an 
e.gg, one small teaspoonful of pepper and one of salt, sage if liked ; 
rub all together and fill the turkey, sewing up so that the stuffing 
cannot cook out ; always put the giblets under the side of the 



44 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

fowl SO they will not dry up, rub salt and pepper on the outside, put 
into a dripping pan with one tea-cupful of water basting often, 
turning it till browned all over. Bake about three hours ; have left 
in the chopping bowl a little stuffing, take out the giblets and chop 
fine, after taking out the turkey, put in a large tablespoonful of 
flour and stir until brown. Put the giblets into a gravy boat and 
pour over them the gravy. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

To Broil Turkey. — Select a very young and tender turkey 
— no others are fit for broiling. After washing and wiping dry. 
split down the middle of the back, open, pound a little to flatten 
out, then place on a broiler over a clear fire, the inside of the 
turkey towards the fire first ; keep turning until nicely browned 
and cooked through ; put into hot pan and work into the fowl 
butter slightly warmed, and salt and pepper. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Turkey, Chicken or Duck Hash. — Pick the meat from the 
bone of any cold, left over fowl ; add to this an equal amount of cold 
stuffing and enough of the gravy or cream to moisten, let it cook 
for a few moments only, season and serve. 

Roast Duck. — Prepare the same as for turkey, adding to the 
dressing two or three finely chopped onions. Serve with apple 
sauce. 

Roast Goose or Gosling. — Two ounces of onions and half as 
much green sage chopped fine, and one coffee-cupful of bread 
crumbs, a little pepper and salt, the yolks of two eggs. Do not quite 
fill the goose but leave room to swell ; roast from one and one- 
half to two hours and serve with gravy and apple sauce. 

Roast Chicken. — Split down the back, season with salt and 
pepper and plenty of butter ; pour a little water into the pan and 
while baking baste often, turning the chicken so as to nicely 
brown all over. When done, take up the chicken, thicken the 
gravy with a little flour and serve in a gravy boat. Chickens 
are nice stuffed and baked in the same manner as turkey. 

Fried Chicken. — Joint young tender chickens, if old, put in 
a stew pan with a little water and simmer gently till tender ; season 
with salt and pepper, dip into flour and fry in hot lard and butter 
until nicely browned ; lay on a hot platter and take the liquor in 
which the chicken was stewed, turn into the frying pan with 



POULTRY 45 

the brown gravy, stir in a little flour, when it is boiled stir in a 
teacup of sweet rich cream and pour over the chicken. — Mrs. M. 
I. Arms. 

To Broil Chicken. — Only young- tender chickens are nice 
broiled. After cleaning and washing them, split down the back, 
wipe dry, season with salt and pepper and lay them, inside down, 
on a hot gridiron over a bed of bright coals. Broil until nicely 
browned and well cooked through, watching and turning to pre- 
vent burning; broil with them a little salt pork cut in thin slices. 
After taking them from the gridiron, work into them plenty of 
butter and serve ; garnish with tlie pork, slices of lemon and 
parsley. — Mrs. J. M. Bonnell. 

To Broil Chicken. — Split them down the back and season 
with pepper and salt. Lay them over a very clear fire and at a 
great distance. Let the inside lie next the fire until it is about half 
done, then turn them and let them be of a fine brown. Let your 
sauce be good gravy with mushrooms and garnish with livers 
broiled, the gizzards cut, slashed and broiled with pepper and 
salt, or this sauce : Take a handful of sorrel, dip in boiling water, 
drain it and have ready half a pint of good gravy, a shallot shredded 
small and some parsley boiled very green. Thicken it with a 
piece of butter rolled in flour and add a glass of red wine. Then 
lay your sorrel in heaps around the fowls and pour the sauce over 
them. Garnish with lemon. 

This quaint recipe is taken from "The Art of Cookery" by 
Mrs. Glasse Alexandria, 1812. — Mrs. A. E. Kauffman. 

Fricassed Chicken. — Cut and joint the chickens into small 
pieces, cover with water and boil till tender ; then season with salt 
and pepper, mix three tablespoonsful of flour smooth with butter 
the size of an ^gg; stir this into a little of the gravy, then turn 
onto the chicken ; let it boil and serve by turning on a platter over 
slices of bread or fresh soda biscuits cut in halves. 

A Pretty Way of Stewing Chicken. — Take two fine 
chickens, half boil them, then take them up in a pewter or silver 
dish. Cut up your fowls, separate all the joint bones one from 
another and then take out the breast bones. If there is not liquor 
enough from the fowls, add a few spoonsful of the water they were 
boiled in, put in a blade of mace and a little salt. Cover close with 
another dish, set it over a stove or chafing dish of coals, let it stew 



46 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

until the chickens are cooked enough and then send them hot to 
the table in the same dish they were stewed in. This is a very 
pretty dish for a sick person ; for a change it is better than butter 
and the sauce is very agreeable and pretty. You may do rabbits, 
partridges or moor game in this way. — Mrs. A. E. Kanffman. 

A Nice Way To Cook Chicken. — Cut the chicken up, put 
into a pan and cover with water ; let it stew as usual, when done, 
make a thickeneing of cream and flour, add butter, pepper and 
salt, have ready a nice short cake, baked and cut into squares, 
rolled thin as for crust ; lay the cakes on the dish and pour the 
chicken and gravy over them while hot. — Mrs. R. IV. Taylcr. 

Chicken Pie. — Stew the chicken and make the gravy the day 
before as hot chicken will make the lower crust soggy. Make pie 
crust as for any pie, roll lower crust very thin, sprinkle the pan 
well with flour to make the crust brown quickly, take the large 
bones out of the chicken, put into pie with cold gravy and cover 
with upper crust ; have oven hot at first so lower crust will cook 
before the chicken can melt and soak in ; then a slower oven and 
bake three-quarters of an hour. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

Chicken Pie Crust. — Three cups of flour, one and one-half 
cups of lard, one cup of water, two teaspoons of salt ; rub three- 
quarters of a cup of lard into the flour — not until fine but leave it 
in lumps ; add salt and wet with the water, then roll the rest of the 
lard in. Two chickens prepared and boiled, as you would for 
stewed chicken, until tender ; for gravy mix two tablespoonfuls of 
flour and two of butter until smooth ; thicken the gravy with this, 
season to taste, boiling a few minutes after thickening. Let the 
chicken and gravy stand until cool before putting on the crust and 
baking. Bake one-half hour. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

Chicken Pot Pie. — Cut and joint a fat chicken, cover with 
water and let it boil gently until tender ; season with salt and pepper 
and thicken the gravy with two tablespoonsful of flour mixed 
smooth with piece of butter the size of an e.gg ; have ready nice light 
bread dough, roll out, cut with a biscuit cutter about an inch 
thick ; let rise and when very light drop this into the boiling 
gravy (having previously removed the chicken to a hot pltter), 
cover, and let it boil from one-half to three-quarters of an hour. 
To ascertain whether it is done or not, stick into one of them a

fork and if it comes out clean, it is done. Lay on the platter with 
the chicken, pour over the gravy and serve.— Mr^. Henry Wick. 

Chicken Pudding.— Cut up the chickens and stew until ten- 
der, then take them from the gravy and spread on a flat dish to 
cool— having first seasoned them well with butter, pepper and 
salt ; make a batter of one quart of milk, three cups of flour, three 
tablespoons of melted butter, one-half teaspoonful of soda, one 
teaspoonful of cream tartar, a little salt. Butter a pudding dish 
and put a layer of the chicken on the bottom and then a cupful 
of the batter over it ; proceed until the dish is full ; the batter must 
form the crust. Bake an hour and serve the thickened gravy in a 
gravy boat.— Mrj. John McCnrdy. 

Chicken Cheese.— Boil two chickens until tender, take out 
all the bones and chop the meat fine, season with salt, pepper and 
butter ; boil down the liquor the chickens were boiled in until there 
remains only enough to make the chopped meat quite moist ; put 
the meat into a mold of any shape that is desirable or convenient ; 
when cold, turn out and cut in slices. It is excellent for picnics 
or for hmch.— Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Minced Powls.— Remove from the bones all the flesh of 
either cold roast or boiled fowls ; clean it from the skin and keep 
covered from the air until ready for use ; boil the bones and skin 
with three-quarters of a pint of water until reduced quite half, 
strain the gravy and let cool ; next (having first skimmed off all the 
fat) put it in a clean saucepan with a half teacup of cream, three 
ounces of butter well mixed with one tablespoonful of flour ; keep 
these stirred until they boil; then put in the fowl (finely minced) 
with three hard boiled eggs chopped and sufiicient salt and pepper 
to season. Shake the mince over the fire until just ready to 
boil, dish it on hot toast and serve. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Chicken en Casserole.— A casserole is an earthenware, fire- 
proof dish that can be used for baking in the oven. A nice, fat, 
tender chicken — suitable for roasting— is the best ; split down the 
back, put in the casserole about two tablespoonfuls of butter, when 
it melts, lay in the chicken the inner side down; lay over this 
some very thin slices of salt pork, a carrot, potatoes and a small 
turnip (all cut in small balls with a vegetable cutter), an onion 
sliced, eight or ten button mushrooms, season with salt and pepper. 



48 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Fry all together until the chicken is a rich brown, turning occas- 
ionally that all sides are browned alike, then dip off any super- 
fluous fat, and pour in a cup of good stock, cover closely and let 
simmer gently in the oven for one hour. Now remove tlic chicken, 
imjoint it and if there is not sufficient gravy add a little stock, let 
it boil and thicken with a very little flour. Place the chicken back 
in the casserole for a few moments only and serve in the casserole. 

Chicken Timbals. — The breast of two raw chickens ground 
in a meat cutter several times until very fine. Stir in one pint of 
carem a little at a time and the whites of three eggs. Grease 
timbal cups thoroughly, fill two-thirds full, set in pan of water 
(half way up tins), cover pan closely and cook twenty minutes. 
Sauce : One pint of cream, one cup of chopped nuishrooms, heat ; 
thicken a little with flour, season with salt and pepper. — Mrs. J. 
H. McEwen. 

Chicken Timbals. — Boil and grind fine one chicken ; boil 
and wash one pint of Italian chestnuts, make a rich cream sauce and 
boil chicken and nuts together in the cream ; season highly. Before 
taking off the stove stir in the yolks of two eggs ; put some truffles 
in the bottom of timbal moulds and fill with the paste ; set moulds 
in hot water until ready to serve. Serve with cream sauce. — Mrs. 
Fox, Saegertozvn. 



GAME 



Wild Turkey.— Wild turkeys are much finer than the domes- 
tic birds. Select one that is young and tender, stuff with chestnuts, 
season well with salt and pepper and roast with frequent bastings. 

To Roast Venison.— Roast a haunch of venison as you would 
a loin of veal and about as long. If you choose, make a plain 
dressing and stuff it ; baste often while baking. 

Broiled Venison Steak.— Broil quickly over a clear fire and 
when sufficiently done pour over two tablespoonsful of currant 
jelly, melted with a piece of butter, pepper and salt. Eat 
while hot on hot plates.— Mr.y. JV. J. Hitchcock. 

To Cook Venison.— Broil as you would a beefsteak rare; 
have ready a gravy of butter, pepper and salt and a very little 
water; heat the gravy without boiling, score the steak all over, 
put it in the gravy and cover tight; keep hot enough to steam 
the meat and send in a covered dish to the table. — Mrs. R. W. 
Tayler. 

Prairie Chicken. — Broil over a quick fire, season with salt, 
pepper, lemon juice and butter well worked in; serve on giblet 
toast, which is made by boiling to a paste the livers of any game 
bird with as many chicken livers as needed, mash to a paste with 
some of the water in which they were cooked, a little sherry is 
added with pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of butter spread on thin 
slices of buttered toast. 

To Roast Partridges, Pheasants or Quail.— Pluck, singe, 
draw and truss them, season with salt and pepper, roast for about 
half an hour in a brisk oven basting often with butter. When 
done place on a dish together with bread crumbs fried brown and 
arranged in small heaps. Gravy should be served in a tureen 
apart. 



50 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Broiled Quail or Woodcock. — After dressing, split down 
the back, sprinkle with salt and pepper and lay on a gridiron, the 
inside down. Broil slowly at first. Serve with cream gravy — Mrs. 
G. B. Woodman. 

To Roast Wild Duck or Teal. — After dressing soak them 
over night in salt and water to draw out the fishy taste; then 
in the morning put them into fresh water, changing several times 
before roatsing. Stuff or not as desired. Serve with currant 
jelly. 

To Roast Wild Fowl. — The flavor is best preserved without 
stuffing. Put pepper, salt and a piece of butter into each ; wild 
fowl require much less dressing than tame. They should be 
served of a fine color and a rich brown gravy. To take off the 
fishy taste which wild fowl sometimes have, put an onion, salt and 
hot water into the dripping pan and baste them for the first ten 
minutes with this, then take away the pan and baste constantly 
with butter. 

Reed Birds. — Select long, sweet potatoes of even size, wash, 
dry and cut in two lengthwise, scoop out the inside leaving a 
shell one-quarter inch thick. Take a reed bird or half a squab, rub 
it with a pinch of salt, lay in one shell and cover with the other ; 
tie them together with a string, cover each potato with a strip of 
pork and place them in a buttered baking pan. Put in an oven for 
thirty minutes, remove the pork at the end of that time, brown for 
five minutes, remove the string but leave each cover in place. 
Serve on a hot napkin. 

Roast Pigeons. — They should be dressed while fresh. If 
young they will be ready for roasting in twelve hours. Dress 
carefully and after making clean, wipe dry and put into each 
bird a small piece of butter dipped in cayenne. Truss the wings 
over the back and roast in a quick oven, keeping them constantly 
basted with butter. Serve with brown gravy. Dish them with 
young watercresses. 

Pigeon Compote. — Truss six pigeons as for broiling. Grate 
the crumbs of a small loaf of bread, scraps one pound of fat bacon, 
chopped thyme, parsley and onion and lemon peel fine, grate a lit- 
tle nutmeg and season with salt and pepper. Mix it up with 
two eggs, put this force meat into the craws of the pigeons, lard

the breasts and fry brown. Place them in a stew pan with some 
beef stock and stew them three-quarters of an hour, thicken with 
a piece of butter rolled in flour. Serve with force meat balls 
around the dish and strain the gravy onto the pigeons. 

PiGEONN Pie.— Dress and wash clean, split down the back and 
then proceed as for chicken pie.— Mr^. IV. S. Bonnell. 

Fillet of Birds or Fowls.— Cut off the breast of birds, fry 
or broil, season and serve in overlapping slices around a pile of 
fresh mushrooms, fry and mix with the stewed livers of the birds 
and enough rich brown gravy to moisten the whole. 

Jugged Hare or Rabbit.— Cut up as you would chicken for 
stewing and fry brown, dredge with flour, put into boiling water 
to simmer about two hours. Fry onions brown. Put into a bag 
mace, allspice, lemon peel and parsley. Put the bag, the onions 
and a little jelly into the stew, season with salt and pepper, garnish 
with force meat balls the same as for roast veal.— Afr^. Wm. 
Bonnell. 

Fried Rabbit or Squirrel.— After the rabbit has been thor- 
oughly cleaned and washed, put it into boiling water and let it 
boil for about ten minutes, drain and when cold cut it into joints, 
dip into beaten egg and then into fine bread crumbs seasoned with 
salt and pepper. When all are ready, fry them in butter over a 
moderate fire fifteen minutes. Thicken the gravy with an ounce 
of butter and a small teaspoonful of flour. Give it a minute's 
boil, stir in two tablespoonfuls of cream, dish the rabbit and pour 
the sauce over it and serve quickly. 

Stewed Rabbit. — Skin and clean the rabbit, cut into pieces, 
put a quarter pound of butter into a stew pan and turn the pieces 
of rabbit about in it until nicely browned, take out the meat, add 
one pint of boiling water to the butter, one tablespoonful flour 
stirred to a paste in cold water, one tablespoonful of salt and a 
little grated onion, if liked. Let this boil up, add the meat stew 
slowly till the rabbit is tender ; serve hot. 



VEGETABLES 



REMARKS. 



Green vegetables should be cooked the same day they are 
gathered. All vegetables should be washed before using, except 
corn and peas, which should be husked and shelled with clean 
hands and not washed as some of the sweetness is thereby ex- 
tracted. Reject stale and withered ones. They should be put in 
boiling water with a little salt and only just time allowed to cook 
them, as they should be sent to the table as soon as done. 

In boiling vegetables the great point is not to let the boiling 
stop. An^ vegetable peeled should be thrown into cold water until 
it is wanted to boil. Green vegetables are better color if not 
covered with the lid to shut in the steam. Try vegetables with a 
fork; if tender, they are done. Old potatoes should be put into 
cold water, new potatoes into boiling water. 

Steamed Potatoes. — Potatoes are much more nutritiuos and 
palatable if properly steamed, than boiled. Wash clean, place in 
a steamer over boiling water and steam rapidly, otherwise will not 
seem done no mtter how long they have been cooked. They should 
steam until the skins crack and the fork will easily penetrate them. 
Do not take from the steamer until time for serving or they will 
become too solid. Skin and serve. 

Baked Potatoes. — Take medium sized potatoes. Wash clean, 
have a hot oven. Bake for twenty minutes to one-half hour, do 
not leave the oven door open one second ; if you do, your potato 
skins become soft ; crisp skin to a boked potato is the best part of 
it. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

Mashed Potatoes. — Wash and cut into halves or quarters, 
put into boiling water, boil one-half hour. When done pour off 
all the water, add salt, mash perfectly smooth, then add a little 
cre^m if you have it, if not, milk, and beat well with fork or spoon. 
The beating makes them light. — Mrs. H. B. Wick, 



Vegetables 53 

To Cook New Potatoes.— Remove the skin by scraping with 
a knife. Boil, in water to cover, with a little salt. When done 
drain off the water, let stand for a few moments on the back of the 
stove to dry off, then half cover with cream seasoned with salt and 
pepper. Allow the cream to boil up around the potatoes for a few 
moments and add, the last thing before serving, a small piece of 
butter. 

Grilled Potatoes.— Take cold boiled potatoes, peel and slice 
them in slices one-third of an inch thick. Dip them into dis- 
solved butter, place on a gridiron over a very clear fire, grill 
them until nicely browned underneath, then turn them and when 
a nice color, put them on a heated dish. Sprinkle with salt and 
pepper and serve very hot. — Mrs. J. M. Bonnell. 

Stewed Potatoes.— A watery potato is preferable to a mealy 
potato for stewing and when the Peerless can be obtained they 
are the best. Boil with the skins on the day before using. When 
ready to use, pare them and cut into small dice but do not chop 
them. Put into a porcelain lined skillet, cover with good cream^ 
season with salt and pepper, let the cream boil up around them 
until the consistency desired, stirring occasionally but carefully. 
Just before serving, add a little piece of butter. — Mrs Henry 
Wick. 

Potatoes au Gratin.— After following the above recipe, 
place the potatoes in a porcelain baking dish, sprinkle the top 
with finely sifted bread crumbs and tiny pieces of butter. Grated 
cheese can also be added over the top of the potatoes if liked. Set 
in a hot oven long enough to brown. 

Saratoga Potatoes.— Peel and slice on a slaw cutter into cold 
water, wash thoroughly and drain. Spread between the folds of 
a clean cloth, rub and pat until dry. Fry a few at a time in boiling 
lard; salt as you take them o\\\..—Mrs. Henry Garlick. 

Home Fried Potatoes.— Take cold boiled potatoes, chop 
fine. Have your frying pan hot with a little sweet lard or roast 
beef drippings. Stir and fry quickly until brown. Serve hot as 
soon as done. Good.— ^F. Scott Bonnell. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes.— Put into your frying pan about two 
ounces of butter and when melted slice fine into this two onions 
and fry until half done. Then add about a quart of cold boiled 



54 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

potatoes sliced, with a little chopped parsley and two ounces of 
butter, salt and pepper to taste. Stir and toss gently until the 
potatoes are all fried a nice brown color. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Duchess Potatoes. — Mash five potatoes nicely, add one table- 
spoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of cream and the yolk of one 
egg, pepper and salt to taste. Press through a pastry bag in nice 
shapes on a greased pan, brush over with &gg and bake a nice 
brown. — Mrs. D. C. Stewart. 

Waldorf Potatoes. — One quart of chopped boiled potatoes, 
one tablespoonful of grated onion, one large teaspoonful of salt, 
almost one pint of rich cream. Let bake in baking dish one-half 
hour. — Mrs. J. M. Bonnell. 

French Fried Potatoes. — Pare small raw potatoes, cut in 
halves, then each half in quarters lengthwise. Put a handful into 
a frying basket, immerse in boiling hot lard until a delicate brown, 
drain in the colander, season with salt and pepper. If your lard 
is too hot, the potatoes will become too brown before cooking 
through. If not hot enough will soak up the grease and become 
soggy. Serve at once. 

QuiRLED Potatoes. — Peel, boil, mash and season as mashed 
potatoes. Then put them into a colander, pressing them through 
into the dish you wish to serve them in. Set in the oven and 
brown. — Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Fried Raw Potatoes. — Pare large potatoes, cut in slices 
quarter of an inch in thickness. Have hot in the skillet drippings 
or lard and butter mixed. Cover the bottom of the skillet with 
sliced raw potatoes. When a light brown on one side, turn. Keep 
covered while cooking. Season with salt and pepper. — Mrs. R. 
McMillan. 

Potatoes Roasted With Meat. — Pare medium sized pota- 
toes, and about one-half hour before the roast is done, place in 
the dripping pan with the roast of meat. Baste with the gravy 
and serve around the roast. 

Escalloped Potatoes With Cheese. — Put a layer of thinly 
sliced cold boiled potatoes into a fireproof dish, season with salt 
and pepper and cover with a layer of grated cheese, add another 
layer of potatoes and so on until all are used. Pour over all a 
white sauce made with a cupful of cream thickened with a tea- 



VEGETABLES 5 5 

Spoonful of flour, a small piece of butter and one egg. Sprinkle 
the top with bread crumbs and bake in a slow oven one-half hour. 
— Mrs. S. Stevenson. 

EscALLOPED Potatoes. — Put alternate layers of sliced cold 
boiled potatoes and slices of hard cold boiled eggs into a baking 
dish. Cover with cream, finely grated bread crumbs over the 
top and a piece of butter. Let cook in oven about one-half hour. 
—Mrs. H. B. Wick, Elyria. 

Potato Croquettes or Balls. — Four large mealy potatoes 
cold. Mash them in a pan with two tablespoonfuls of fresh melted 
butter, a pinch of salt, a little pepper, one tablespoonful of cream 
and the beaten yolk of one egg. Rub it together for about five 
minutes or until very smooth. Shape the mixture into balls about 
the size of a walnut, or small rolls. Dip them into an egg well 
beaten and then into the finest sifted bread crumbs. Fry them in 
boiling lard. — Miss Sallie Arms. 

Potato Ribbons. — Wash and peel large potatoes. Let them 
lie in cold water for few moments, cut them into ribbons round 
and round like an apple and keep the strips as nearly as possible 
of one width. They must not be too thin or they will break. Frv 
them in plenty of smoking hot fat until they are lightly browned. 
Drain them on a wire sieve and sprinkle a little salt and pepper 
over them. Serve on a hot dish. 

Sweet Potatoes. — (To boil, to fry, to bake.) — Sweet po- 
tatoes require more time to cook than common potatoes. 

To Boil. — Take large fine potatoes, wash clean, boil with the 
skins on in plenty of water but without salt. They will take at 
least one hour. Drain off the water and set them for a few minutes 
in a tin pan before the fire or on the stove that they may be well 
dried. Peel them before sending to the table. 

To Fry. — Choose large potatoes, boil them, and then having 
taken off the skins, cut the potatoes in slices and fry in butter 
or in nice drippings. 

To Bake. — Bake as the common potato except give them a 
longer time. 

Sweet Potato Croquetts. — Four good sized sweet potatoes 
equal three cups of potatoes. Boil with the jackets on, skin and 



56 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

press. Mash while still hot, mix one tablespoonful of butter, one 
tablespoonful of cream, one teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Mix over a fire in a sauce pan until the po- 
tatoes come away from the sides of the pan. Turn out into a flat 
dish, when cool form into cork shaped croquettes. Cover with 
egg and bread crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat. — Miss Isabella 
McCurdy. 

Turnips. — Pare and cut in pieces, put them into boiling water 
with a little salt. Boil for an hour and a half ; when quite tender, 
drain, set on the back of the stove for a moment to evaporate the 
water and then mash fine. Season with butter, pepper and salt. 
(Some use cream which makes them very nice.) Stir them over 
the fire until they are thoroughly mixed. Turnips should be 
served hot. — Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Creamed Turnips. — Pare the turnips, and cut into dice; put 
directly into cold water; then cook in salted boiling water until 
tender; drain them, pour over them a white sauce made in the 
proportion of one tablespoon of butter to two of flour melted 
together, and mixed with hot milk or cream. — Mrs. S. J. McElevey. 

Beets. — Boil with the skins on as they bleed if cut previous to 
boiling. Young beets will cook tender in one hour. Winter beets 
will require three or four hours' boiling. Make a dressing of a 
little water, butter, pepper and salt with a little weak vinegar. 
Some do not add vinegar until at the table. 

Green Corn on the Cob. — Take ofif the oustide leaves and 
the silk, letting the innermost leaves remain on until after the corn 
is boiled, which renders the corn much sweeter. Boil for half an 
hour in plenty of water, drain and after removing the leaves and 
silk, serve. 

Green Corn Roasted on the Ear. — Spread ears of green 
sweet corn with butter, pepper and salt. Lay them in a dripping 
pan and set as close as possible before clear hot coals. Turn the 
ears as they brown until all are browned and serve hot or set 
the pan in a very hot oven and brown the corn. 

Green Corn Pudding. — One quart of milk, five eggs, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one tablespoonful of white sugar, 
one dozen large ears of corn. Grate the corn from the cob, beat 
the whites and yolks of the eggs separately, put the corn and 



VEGETABLES py 

yolks together, stir hard and add the melted butter, then the milk 
gradually, stirring hard all the time. Next the sugar and then 
the whites and a little salt. Bake slowly, covering the dish at first. 
It will bake in about one hour.— Afr^. John McCurdy. 

Green Corn PuDDiNc.-Twelve ears of corn, one pint of 
milk, two eggs beaten separately, two tablespoonfuls of flour one 
of melted butter, pepper and salt. Mix together, cutting the whites 
through. Bake thirty to thirty-five minues.— Mr^. P. B. Owen. 

Lima Beans.— Shell, wash and put into boiling water with a 
little salt. When boiled tender, drain and season them and either 
dress with cream or a lump of butter and let simmer for a few 
moments. 

String or Butter BsANS.-String and cut them into pieces 
one-half inch long. When boiled tender, drain, season and dress 
with cream. 

Boiled Onions.— Skin them thoroughly. Put them to boil; 
when they have boiled a few moments, pour off the water and 
add clear cold water and then set them to boil again. Pour this 
away and add more cold water, when they may boil till done. This 
will make them white and clear and very mild in flavor. After they 
are done, pour off all the water and dress with a little cream, salt 
and pepper to taste. 

Stuffed Onions.— Select large common onions, peel them 
and a little more than cover them with water slightly salted. When 
tender, drain and remove with a sharp knife, from the center of 
each, the core, being careful not to break the onion. Fill this 
space with cold chicken veal, butter, sweetbreads chopped very 
fine, season well. To a cupful of chopped meat add four table- 
spoonfuls of cream or soup stock, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, two tablespoonfuls of fine bread crumbs. Set on the 
stove to heat and stir in one egg. Fill the space in the onion with 
this dressing, cover with fine bread crumbs, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper. Set in the oven lopg enough to brown. 

Saute Onions.— Pare and slice them, let them stew for a 
httle while in hot water, then drain the water off, season and fry 
brown in drippings. 

Fried Onions.— Slice Spanish or Bermuda onions very thin. 
Let stand in ice water one hour, then lay on a clean cloth as Sar-

atogo potatoes would be treated. Fry in deep lard very hot. 
Season with salt and pepper. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

Spinach. — Good spinach requires washing and close pick- 
ing. Boil twenty minutes in boiling water. Drain, season with 
butter, pepper and salt and garnish the dish with slices of hard 
boiled eggs. 

Spinach. — Boil and chop. Put into a squeezer, mix with 
seasoning and cream ; put into moulds. After turning out cover 
with hard boiled eggs chopped, and sprinkle over the top. — Mrs P. 
B. Ozvens. 

Stewed Celery. — Clean the heads thoroughly. Take off the 
coarse, green, outer leaves. Cut in small pieces and stew in a 
little broth. When tender, add some rich cream, a little flour and 
butter enough to thicken the cream. Season with pepper, salt 
and a little nutmeg, if that is agreeable. — Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Peas. — Shell, wash in cold water, cook them until tender. 
Take from the water with a skimmer and season with butter, 
pepper and salt. Some prefer cream added. 

Asparagus. — Cook only the tender, green stocks. Cut them 
of equal length and boil in water with a little salt till tender. 
While the asparagus is cooking, prepare some nicely toasted bread, 
lay the asparagus on the toast and season with butter, salt and 
pepper or pour over a little cream previously scalded. Asparagus 
can also be served with a hoUandaise sauce. 

Parsnip Stew. — Threee slices of salt pork, boil one hour 
and a half ; scrape tive large parsnips, cut in quarters lengthwise, 
add to the pork and let boil one-half hour. Then add a few potatoes 
and let all boil together until the potatoes are soft. The fluid 
in the kettle should be about a cupful when ready to take off. — 
Mrs. M. Adelia Wick. 

Fried Parsnips. — Wash parsnips, scrape and boil them till 
tender. Then cut in slices, dip into flour and fry a light brown 
with butter and lard enough to prevent sticking. 

Baked Tomatoes. — Cut in slices good fresh tomatoes (not 
too ripe). Put a layer of them in a dish suitable for baking, then 
a layer of bread crumbs, and so on until the dish is full. Bake 
one hour. A little grated onion can be added if liked. — Mrs. 
Sydney Strong. 



VEGETABLES 59 

Browned Tomatoes. — Take large round tomatoes and halve 
them, place them the skin side down in a frying pan in which a 
very small quantity of butter and lard have been previously melted. 
Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and dredge well with flour. 
Place the pan on a hot part of the fire and let them brown thor- 
oughly ; then stir and let them brown again, and so on until they 
are quite done. They lose their acidity and their flavor is su- 
perior to stewed tomatoes. 

Baked Tomatoes. — Fill a deep pan (as many as will cover 
the bottom) with ripe tomatoes. Round out a hole in the center 
of each, fill up with bread crumbs, pepper, butter and salt. Put 
a teacup of water in the pan and bake until brown. Send to the 
table hot. — Mrs. W. Scott Bonnell. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — One dozen round, smooth tomatoes, 
one pint of boiled rice, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of pepper, one pint of chopped pecan nuts. Cut a 
slice off of the stem end and with the fingers press out the seeds. 
Stuff the tomatoes with the mixture, heaping in the center. In 
pan put slice of onion, the centers taken out of the tomatoes, salt, 
spoonful of celery seed and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Add 
one tablespoonful of flour mixed with a little water (to make 
smooth) to sauce in pan. Thicken, press through the colander,

basting often with melted butter. — Mrs. J. D. Wick. 

Stuffed Tomatoes. — Take ten smooth, round, medium sized 
tomatoes, wash them and cut from the smooth end of each a thin 
slice. With a spoon remove as much of the inside or pulp of the 
tomato as possible, being careful not to break through the skin. 
Arrange each one in baking pan, sprinkle inside of each with 
salt, pepper and small bits of butter. Put the pulp of the inside 
of the tomato into a chopping bowl with one small onion, a tea- 
cupful of bits of cold chicken, veal or lamb chopped fine. Season 
high with salt, paprika and a little butter. Fill the tomatoes each 
full with this dressing, first draining off the juice. Have some fine 
bread crumbs highly seasoned, place a teaspoonful of the crumbs 
on each tomato with a bit of butter. Pour the remainder of the 
dressing in the baking pan. Bake in oven from one-half to three- 
quarters of an hour. Remove carefully to hot platter with griddle

Artichokes. — First soak the artichokes in strong salt and 
water for some time and afterwards rinse them in several waters 
in order to expel the insects. Cut the stocks even and trim away 
the longer leaves. Boil them in plenty of boiling salt water with 
the tops downward and let them remain until the leaves can easily 
be drawn out. Serve hot with Hollandaise sauce. The leaves 
should be pulled out with the fingers and dipped into the sauce, 
the tender end of the leaf only being good. Time to cook, if young, 
about one-half hour. Allow one artichoke for each person to serve.

SALADS 



REMARKS. 

Everything to be used in salads should be of the freshest, 
and all salads served very cold. Lettuce or cress, young, crisp 
and dry. Oil — wliich forms the chief part of salad — should be 
perfectly fresh and, like perfectly pure butter, is almost, if not 
absolutely, tasteless. Do not dress salad until it is wanted. 

There is an admirable Spanish proverb about dressing salads, 
which says, "It requires three persons to mix a salad — a spend- 
thrift to turn in the oil, a miser to pour in the vinegar and a 
madman to stir it together." 

Chicken Salad. — To two large boiled fowls (cold), take 
two large heads of celery or four small ones. Having removed 
all the skin and fat, cut the meat from the bones into very small 
pieces. It is best not to mix the dressing with the salad until 
just before it is to be eaten. Put into a porcelain kettle the gravy 
from the chicken, one-half pint of vinegar, one-half pint of sweet 
oil or melted butter, one large tablespoonful of Coleman's mus- 
tard, one small teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful of 
salt, the yolks of eight eggs beaten and stirred in just before 
taken ofif, one teacupful of cream stirred into the dressing when 
cold. Mix together with a silver fork and garnish with celery 
tops. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

Chicken Salad. — Two large chickens boiled until tender 
(cold), two large heads of celery or three small ones. Cut the 
celery and chicken into small pieces but do not chop them. In 
cooking the chicken let the water boil away until there is not 
more than a teacupful. Save this and the fat that is with it and 
put in the dressing. Put this on the stove with half a pint of 
strong vinegar, one gill of mixed mustard, one-half teaspoonful 
of white pepper, two teaspoonfuls of salt, a very little cayenne 
pepper (not more than one-eighth of a teaspoonful). When hot, 
stir in the yolks of ten eggs well beaten. When thick, take from 



SALADS 67 

the fire and when cold add one-half pint of thick cream and one- 
half pint of olive oil. If the chickens are very fat, less oil will 
answer. Some prefer half butter. When cold, mix with the 
celery and chicken. — Mrs. M. I. Arms. 

Chicken Salad. — Two large boiled fowls (cold), two large 
heads of celery or four small ones. The dressing is the yolks of 
six hard boiled eggs mashed, one-half pint of sweet oil or butter, 
one-half pint of vinegar, one gill of mixed mustard, one small 
teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one small teaspoonful of salt, 
two raw eggs well beaten and one-half cup of cream. — Mrs. H 
B. Wick. 

Chicken Salad. — Take two hard boiled eggs, lay them in 
water until quite cold. Put the yolks into a small bowl and mash 
them very fine adding the yolks of two raw eggs, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one large tablespoonful of dry mustard and a very little 
cayenne pepper. Stir this well, always one way. When well 
mixed, add a very little sweet oil, stirring all the time. After 
this is mixed, put in more, a very little at a time, until you have 
used a third of a bottle. Then add a large spoonful of vmegar 
or lemon juice, then more oil as before, using in all two-thirds of 
a bottle. Then another spoonful of vinegar. When well mixed 
it must be very light and a nice color. Set on the ice for two 
or three hours. Not more than twenty minutes before using the 
salad, mix it and prepare for the table by putting with the meat 
about half the dressing. Stir it up well and then pour onto the 
meat one wine-glass of best vinegar. Stir this up well. It will 
turn the chicken very white. If it requires a little more salt add 
it now. Place the chicken in the center of a flat dish large enough 
to lay lettuce or celery around the meat. Wipe the lettuce as 
dry as you can, lay around the meat, then with a spoon put the 
rest of the dressing on the lettuce. — Mrs. Wm. J. Hitchcock. 

Sweet Bread Salad. — Boil the sweet breads twenty minutes. 
Then drop them into cold milk, split them and fry brown in butter. 
Break in small pieces with lettuce and mix with the dressing. 
Make a dressing with the yolks of two eggs, two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar, two teaspoonfuls of mixed mustard, the least bit of 
sugar, one bottle of olive oil poured into this with a thread sized 
stream, stirring all the time. The dressing for salmon salad is 
also nice for this. — Mrs. W. Scott Bonnell.

Sweet Bread Salad. — Soak sweet breads in salt and water 
for one hour. Rinse in fresh water and boil one-half hour in salt 
and water. Then drop in cold milk and whiten. When thoroughly- 
cold, cut into dice. Take fresh, crisp lettuce leaves and wipe 
dry. Shred about one-half the quantity of lettuce that you have 
of sweet breads, cover with mayonnaise dressing and serve on 
crisp lettuce leaves very cold. — Mrs. C. H. Booth. 

Lobster Salad. — To a three-pound lobster take the yolk of 
one egg. Beat very lightly. Then take the yolks of three hard 
boiled eggs (cold) and add to the raw yolk, beating all the time. 
Add gradually — a few drops at a time — one-half bottle of the 
finest olive oil still stirring all the time. Then add one and one- 
half tablespoonfuls of the best English mustard, salt and pepper 
to taste. Beat the mixture until light, add a tablespoonful of 
strong vinegar. Cut the lobster into small pieces and mix with 
it salt and pepper. Pour over it the dressing just before sending to 
the table. Garnish with the white of egg (boiled), celery tops 
and the small claws. — Mrs. W. J. Hitchcoock. 

Salmon Salad. — For a pound can of California salmon. 
Garnish with lettuce. Make a dressing of one small teacupful 
of vinegar, butter half the size of an egg, one teaspoonful of 
Coleman's mustard, one-quarter teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar, two eggs. 
When cold, add one-half teacupful of cream and pour over the

SAUCES AND RELISHES FOR MEATS 75 

Mint Sauce. — Wash the mint very clean, pick the leaves 
from the stalk and chop them fine. Pour onto them vinegar 
enough to moisten the mint well. Add fine sugar to sweaten. — 
Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Egg Sauce. — Three ounces of butter beaten with one ounce 
of flour. Stir into it one pint of boiling water, salt and pepper. 
Cook fifteen minutes. Pour into a sauce boat having hard boiled 
eggs sliced or chopped in it. — Mrs. Wm. J. Hitchcock. 

Oyster Sauce. — One pint of oysters cut small. Boil for five 
minutes in their own liquor, a cup of milk, a tablespoonful of 
butter rubbed smooth in a tablespoonful of flour, salt and pepper. 
Let it boil. 

Celery Sauce. — Pick and wash two heads of celery, cut 
them into pieces one inch long and stew them in a pint of water 
with one teaspoonful of salt until the celery is tender. Rub a 
large spoonful of butter and a spoonful of flour well together. 
Stir this into a pint of cream, put in the celery and let it boil up 
once. Serve hot with boiled poultry. 

Mushroom Sauce. — One tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour, a cup of stock and one-half cup of mushrooms ; 
salt and pepper. Brown the butter, add flour, stir until smooth, 
add stock and when smooth strain. Add the mushrooms and 
season when the sauce has thickened. Pepper and Worcestershire 
sauce to taste. — Miss Isahelle McCurdy. 

Browned Mushroom Sauce. — Put into a hot frying pan 
three tablespoonfuls of butter. When brown, stir in one-half of 
a small onion (sliced) and two or three slices of carrots. Let 
brown thoroughly. When done skim out the onion and carrot. 
Then pour into the brown butter the liquor from a can of mush- 
rooms and two cups of good beef stock. When boiling, thicken 
with enough flour (previously stirred smooth with a little cream) 
until the consistency of good, thick cream. Strain and add the 
mushrooms cut into small pieces. Let boil again and serve.

tablespoonful of minced parsley, a teaspoonful each of minced 
cucumber pickles, minced capers, two small spoons of French 



y6 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

mustard, six drops of lemon juice and eight drops of onion juice. 
A LA Maitre d'Hotel Butter. — Cream one-half cup of 
butter, add one-half teaspoonful of salt, dash of pepper, one-half 
tablespoonful of finely chopped parsley and one-half tablespoonful 
of lemon juice very slowly. — Airs. W. J. Sampson. 

ViLLEROY Sauce. — Take an equal quantity of butter and flour.. 
Mix well and stir it over the fire in a sauce pan until highly colored. 
Then stir in one pint of meat broth, a few mushrooms and a pinch 
of sweet herbs or vegetable bunch. Let the mixture simmer 
for fifteen minutes ; then strain through a fine hair sieve and 
boil until slightly reduced. When ready to serve, thicken the 
sauce with the yolks of two or three eggs. A good sauce for 
sweet-breads. — Oscar. 

Hollandaise Sauce. — This sauce is difficult to make so that 
it will not curdle. To make it, use a double boiler but do not let 
the water get more than warm. If too hot, it will spoil the sauce. 
Put in the upper boiler the yolks of three eggs and stir them a 
little. Then add a cup of butter bit by bit, letting each melt and 
become incorporated with the eggs just as each drop of oil is in 
mayonnaise. Stir steadily and constantly, and above all do not 
try to hurry the sauce or it will separate. Squeeze a lemon, 
carefully remove all the seeds and measure out two thirds of it. 
When the butter and eggs are worked together perfectly, lift the 
boilers from the fire but leave them together so that the sauce 
cannot get a chance to cool. Add salt, pepper and drop in, little 
by little, the lemon juice. 

Bread Sauce for Game. — Sift two cupfuls of dried bread 
crumbs. Put on the fire a pint of milk and a small onion (sliced). 
When the milk is scalded, remove the onion and add enough of 
the fine crumbs to thicken it. Season with a tablespoonful of 
butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper, and nut- 
meg. Put the coarse crumbs into a pan with a tablespoonful of 
butter and saute a light brown stirring all the time. Add a dash 
of paprika. Serve the fried crumbs on the dish with the game: 
Serve the sauce in a sauce boat. — Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. — Take the yolk of one &gg, beat with 
an tgg beater until it begins to look foamy, not enough to make 
it light. Then add olive oil, a drop at a time, until it begins to 
thicken. Press the juice from one lemon into a cup; put a level 



SAUCES AND RELISHES FOR MEATS 'J'] 

teaspoonful of salt in and a little paprika and a small half tea- 
spoonful of mustard. Then begin to add this mixture to the 
oil and ^^g, a few drops of the mixture, then a little more oil, 
until it gets very stiff. You will have about one-half pint when 
done. Just before using, beat four tablespoonfuls of thick cream 
to a stiff froth and fold lightly into the mayonnaise. — Mrs S. 
Stevenson. 

Mayonnaise Dressing. — Beat the yolk of three eggs; add 
slowly two cups of olive oil, thinning with lemon juice or vinegar. 
Will require about two lemons or about one-half cup of vinegar. 
One-half teaspoonful of salt, a liberal sprinkle of paprika. To 
mix, use Dover beater. Last, fold in the well beaten whites of 
two eggs. — Mrs. IV. D. Euzver. 

French Dressing. — To three tablespoonfuls of best salad 
oil use two of vinegar (some prefer the Tarragon), two salt 
spoonfuls of salt, one of paprika. Beat the salt and the paprika 
into the oil until thoroughly dissolved. Then add vinegar and 
beat again. For some salads a little onion juice is an improvement. 

Mustard for Table Use. — One-half teacup of vinegar ; put 
on to boil. Butter the size of a walnut, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one tablespoonful of sugar, one-half teacup of Coleman's mustard 
mixed with a little cold vinegar. — Mrs. C. D. Anns. 

French Mustard. — Three ounces of salt, two ounces of 
grated horseradish, one clove of garlic, one quart of boiling vine- 
gar. Let it remain mixed twenty-four hours ; strain and mix with 
flour of mustard to thickness required. 

To Brown Flour. — Sift some fiour and spread on a plate and 
set in the oven, stirring it frequently so that it may be burned all 
through the same. Nice for thickening or coloring soups and 
gravies. Put in a jar and keep well covered to keep any length 
of time. 

Apple Sauce.— Pare, core and slice sour, juicy apples. Stew 
them with sufficient water to prevent burning. When done, mash 
them through a colander. Sweeten to taste. Add a tiny piece 
of butter and a little nutmeg or lemon if liked. 

Cranberry Sauce. — One quart of cranberries, one quart of 
water and one pound of white sugar. Make a syrup of the water 
and sugar. After washing the berries clean — and picking out all 



78 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

poor ones — drop them into the boihng syrup. Let them cook from 
fifteen to twenty minutes. They are very nice strained. 

A Quick Mayonnaise Dressing. — Break the yolk of an egg 
into a small, deep bowl (the egg must be perfectly fresh so that 
it stands up stiff and firm). Add four tablespoonfuls of best 
salad oil, one of Tarragon vinegar, one-half teaspoonful of salt 
and whip with an egg beater until thick. A thick mayonnaise is 
the result. Mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika may be added if 
desired. This makes enough dressing for one-half dozen plates 
of salad. 

Horse-Radish Sauce. — Take the roots, wash and scrape 
clean, grate fine, cover with strong vinegar, put into a bottle and 
keep well corked or it will lose its strength. 

Baked Pears or Peaches. — Take either the fresh or the 
canned fruit, pared, cut through the center and cored. Lay in a 
porcelain lined pan the hollow side up. Fill the cavities with 
sugar and small bits of butter and a little ground cinnamon. Pour 
over one-half cup of water and bake in the oven until waxy. 

Gooseberry Relish. — Two quarts of gooseberries, two 
oranges cut in cubes (rind left on), one-half pound of raisins, one 
pint of water, three pints of sugar. Cook twenty minutes or until 
quite thick. — Mrs. J. H. McEwen. 



EGGS AND OMELETS 



To Boil Eggs.— If they are wanted quite soft, pour over 
them boiling water until well covered and let them remain on the 
back of the stove for five minutes. For hard boiled eggs let them 
boil ten minutes. — Mrs. AI. I. Anns. 

To Poach Eggs.— Break the eggs separately into a saucer, 
and after the water in the sauce pan has boiled slip the eggs one 
by one into the water. Throw carefully with a spoon a little of 
the water over each to whiten and do not let them cook too hard. 
When done, take out with a skimmer and lay on slices of buttered 
toast. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and put a small piece of 
butter on each egg. 

Poached Eggs in Aspic. — Make a good strong veal or 
chicken stock. Put a small slice of cold boiled ham or tongue in 
the bottom of individual dishes. Pour over this a little of the 
stock and let stiffen. Then place on each a poached egg and pour 
over more stock to which has been added a little slice of green 
pepper, pimento and chopped olives. Set on ice until ready to 
serve. — Mrs. H. B. Wick, Elyria. 

Poached Eggs with Mushrooms. — In slightly salted boiling 
water deep enough to cover, break ten eggs and do not let the 
water boil again, but dip up over the eggs until the whites are 
set. Have ready ten slices of nicely browned toast with edges 
neatly trimmed, butter them. Take up the eggs carefully, place 
on the toast, season with salt and pepper and on the top of each, 
place a fresh mushroom previously sauted in butter to a delicate 
brown. Pour over a brown mushroom sauce and serve on a hot 
platter or individual plates. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Fried Eggs. — Have in a skillet some pork drippings boiling 
hot. Break the eggs into this carefully — not breaking the yolks 
— and fry them until the vv^hite hardens. If preferred, turn and 
fry on both sides. Season with salt and pepper. 



80 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Scrambled Eggs. — Take eight or ten eggs. Have ready in 
a skillet butter quite hot. Drop in the eggs and stir well all the 
time until they harden a little. Season with salt and pepper. — 
Mrs. R. McMillan. 

Scrambled Eggs with Mushrooms. — Cut one-half can of 
mushrooms into thin slices. Beat five eggs without separating 
until the yolks and whites are blended only. Add five tablespoon- 
fuls of cream. Mix well. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a 
chafing dish and when hot, add half can of mushrooms. Cook 
until they are heated and begin to delicately brown. Then turn 
in the five beaten eggs. As soon as they begin to cook, stir and 
continue stirring until they have cooked to the desired consis- 
tency. Season when about half cooked with one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of paprika, a teaspoonful of salt and serve at once. — Mrs. 
R. McCurdy. 

Mexican Eggs. — A quart can of tomatoes, two onions and 
eight eggs. Let the onion (finely minced) cook in the tomatoes 
until it is soft. Break into this the eggs, stir them through it.

Mrs. W. D. Euwer. 

Hard Boiled Eggs. — Place the eggs in cold water in a sauce 
pan. Bring the water to a boil and let the eggs boil for ten minutes. 
After the water comes to the boiling point, take out the eggs and 
let them get cold in cold water. When cold, immediately remove 
the outer shell, but do not cut up hard boiled eggs for garsishing 
purposes until close upon the time they are wanted as the yolks 
dry up and soon become discolored. 

Shirred Eggs. — Break the eggs in a porcelain dish or in indi- 
vidual dishes. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and bits of butter 
on top, and set in the oven until the whites harden. Serve quite 
hot in the dish in which they are cooked. 

Devilled Eggs. — Boil the eggs fifteen minutes and drop into 
a pan of cold water as soon as they are taken out of the pot. This 
allows the shells to be removed without breaking the whites. Cut 
into halves and take out the yolks. Mix with a little vinegar, 
mustard, salt, pepper, melted butter, onion and celery seed. Rub 
to a smooth paste and fill the cavities in the whites. The cuplike 
white of the egg can be made to stand by cutting a small portion

spoonful of cream. Have in the omelet pan a piece of butter. 
When the butter is boiling hot, pour in the omelet and shake 
until it begins to stiffen and then let it brown. Fold double and 
serve hot. — Miss Em. Arms. 

Omelet. — Take four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separ- 
ately, three tablespoonfuls of cold water stirred into the yolks. 
then fold in the beaten whites. Have omelet pan very hot with 
small bits of butter. Put in omelet and let stand on the stove until 
it sets. Then put in the oven until dried on the top, which takes 
about four minutes. Serve with cream sauce. — Mrs. W. S. 
Bonnell. 

Eggs a la Creole. — Beat four eggs until blended only, add 
four tablespoonfuls of cream or stock. Brown a teaspoonful of 
onion finely chopped in butter, add one and one-half cups of to- 
matoes drained, then cook for eight minutes. Add one table- 
spoonful of sliced mushrooms and one tablespoonful of red pep- 
pers. Season. Pour in eggs and cook as for scrambled eggs.

milk, salt and pepper. Let stand until soft. Beat eight eggs light. 
Heat the skillet, adding a large lump of butter. Mix the bread 
and eggs, pour into the skillet and after the eggs harden, divide 
in the middle. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

Egg Omelet. — For six persons take four eggs, separate the 
yolks from the whites, pour boiling water over one-half slice of 
stale bread ; press most of the water out of the bread. Beat the 
yolks of the eggs and add them to the bread and beat together. 
Then add a few spoonfuls of milk and salt and pepper to taste. 
When the frying pan is hot, butter it well ; have the whites beaten 
to a stiff froth and just before putting into the pan, stir in the 
whites gently. When a nice brown, cut it in quarters, turn and 
brown on the other side. Then serve hot. 

Spanish Omelet. — For making omelets a perfectly clean, 
porcelain lined frying pan is best. Place in the pan a piece of 
butter the size of a small egg. Beat four eggs until well mixed 
but not stiff. Add a little salt. When the butter is melted, pour 
the eggs into the hot frying pan and as it cooks raise the edges 
carefully with a knife, keeping the cream part towards the center 
until it partially stiffens. The moment it is thickened or set, have 
ready one onion, one green pepper and one ripe tomato, all chopped 
together, well seasoned and sauted for a few minutes in hot butter. 
Spread this hot mixture over the center of the omelet, fold and 
serve at once. Omelets should be eaten immediately after they 
are cooked or they will become tough. Grated cheese or chopped 
ham, stewed tomatoes or mushrooms can be used in this omelet 
instead of the Spanish mixture. — Mrs. IV m. H. Hudnnt. 



CHLESE 



REMARKS ON RAREBITS. 

The ordinary American factory cheese is best for rarebits 
because it grates easily, melts quickly and mixes well with the 
other ingredients. The more quickly they are eaten after they 
are cooked, the better they are. 

Welsh Rarebit. — Two and one-half pint cups of grated or 
finely cut cheese, one teaspoonful of mustard even, one-half glass 
of bass ale or three tablespoonfuls of cream, one saltspoonful of 
salt, cayenne pepper to taste, one teaspoonful of butter just melted 
in the chafing dish. Pour in cheese, add seasoning, stir in ale or 
cream slowly. Stir until the rarebit becomes stringy. Serve at 
once on thin slices of toast. Light cheese — not too rich — is best 
to use. — Mrs. IV. J. Sampson. 

Golden Buck. — Take of good, sharp American cheese, one 
pound; chop (not grate) it until reduced the size of a pea. On 
it sprinkle separately a sprinkle of cayenne pepper and a generous 
though not heaping teaspoonful of salt and dried mustard. Mix 
well together after having drained all into a scrupulously clean 
galvanized frying pan. Then pour over the cheese a tumbler full 
of old stock ale. The fire must be clear but not too brisk so that 
the temperature may be gradually raised to the melting of the 
cheese. Stir constantly but gently with a circular motion from the 
circumference of the pan to the center until the cheese is all dis- 
solved into a creamlike consistency and the bubbles are rising 
freely. Mix in one v/ell beaten fresh egg, stir again for a minute 
and a half and then pour over hot toast. The toast must have 
been previously prepared in this way : Slice evenly and of the 
thickness of one-half inch bread about twenty-four hours old. 
Toast a nice brown, cut off the crust and arrange on a platter. 
Pour over the cheese and serve a poached egg placed on each piece 
of toast. — Lawrence Barrett.

poached egg laid on it. 

Yorkshire Rarebit. — A Yorkshire is a Golden Buck with 
a slice of broiled or fried bacon laid on the poached egg. 

Brandy Cheese. — Allow one-half tumbler of brandy to one 
pound of best cheese. Grate the cheese, mix well with the brandy 
and press hard into a crock with a potato masher. Cover with 
thin paper dipped in brandy. When wanted for use, slice. — Miss 
Sallie Arms. 

Sage Cheese. — Pound in a mortar the young sage leaves 
until you have extracted the juice. Proceed then as for brandy 
cheese. 

Cottage Cheese or Smearcase. — Set in the warm oven of 
a stove where it is not too hot, a gallon crock of sour milk. Let 
stand until the milk separates. Then pour into a clean, white 
cloth and let it hang until the liquor is all drained out, which will 
be about twenty-four hours. Do not squeeze as this toughens it. 
Then take the curd and mix with it sweet cream until the consis- 
tency desired. Some like it quite creamy. Season to taste with 
salt and pepper. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Cheese Boulettes. — One and one-half cupfuls of American 
cheese, one tablespoonful of flour, whites of three eggs, one table- 
spoonful of Parmesan cheese, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful of paprika. Grate the American cheese 
very fine, add the Parmesan and the seasonings. Mix well. Add 
the whites of the eggs beaten stifif and dry. Add the flour, form 
into small balls, roll in bread crumbs and fry in deep smoking fat. 
— Miss Isahelle McCurdy. 

Cheese Crusts. — Cut bread into strips one inch wide and 
four to five inches long and one-half inch thick. Cover with grated 
cheese. Season with salt and pepper and set in a hot oven to 
brown. 

Cheese Stew. — Place some pieces of cheese cut up very small 
in a tin with a little butter. Stir it about until all is mixed. Season, 
and stew until the cheese and butter are of one consistency. Some 
add a very little Worcestershire sauce. Serve very hot in a tin.

Serve at once. 

Cheese Balls to be Served with Salad. — One cup of 
grated cheese, mix with the white of one egg. Season with pap- 
rika. Roll in a ball the size of a hickorynut. Then roll the balls 
in fine bread crumbs and fry in deep lard. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell.

Pressed Chicken. — Boil two chickens until tender. Take 
out the bones and chop the meat fine. Season with salt, pepper 
and butter. Boil down the liquor the chickens were boiled in until 
there remains only enough to make the chopped meat quite moist. 
Put the meat into a mold of any shape that is desirable or con- 
venient. When cold, turn out and cut in slices. It is excellent 
for picnics or lunch. — Mrs. J. C. Wick. 

Chicken Croquettes. — One cold boiled chicken chopped 
fine. Then take a pint of sweet milk and when the milk is boiled, 
stir into it two large tablesponfuls of flour made thin in a little 
cold milk. After the flour is well cooked with the milk, put in a 
piece of butter the size of an &gg, add salt and cayenne pepper. 
Stir all well into the chicken. Roll up with your hand into balls 
and dip first into an tgg beaten up, then into crackers rolled fine, 
and fried in hot lard or tallow (fresh tallow, half and half lard, 
is very nice). — Miss Laura Wick. 

Chicken Croquettes. — Take cold veal, chicken or sweet 
breads, a little of each or separately. Cut very fine a little fat and 
lean of ham ; half the quantity of the whole of bread crumbs, two 
eggs, butter the size of an tgg, pepper, salt and a little mustard. 
Knead like sausage meat, adding a little cream. Form into

Marrowbones. — Have the bones cut into pieces two or three 
inches long. Scrape and wash them very clean, spread a little 
thick dough on each end to keep the marrow in, then tie each one 
in a piece of cheese-cloth and boil them for one hour. Remove 
the cloth and paste and place each bone on a square of toast. 
Sprinkle with salt and a little red pepper and serve very hot. The 
marrowbones can be boiled without being cut. The marrow then 
remove with a spoon and place on squares of hot toast. — Mrs. C. 
F. Hofer. 

Marrowbones. — Have the bottom of the bones cut so that 
they will stand upright. Cover the ends where the marrow is with 
a flour and water thick paste. Boil them in a sauce pan but do 
not let the water come higher than half way up the bone. Time to 
boil rather more than an hour. Serve a hot dry toast with them. 
The marrow should be scooped out and quickly spread lightly 
over the toast and then freely sprinkled with salt and pepper. — 
English Cook Book. 

Frog Legs. — Only the hid legs are fit for cooking. After 
skinning them, let stand in salt water for one-half hour. Then 
wipe dry, dip in milk, then fiour or finely sifted bread crumbs and 
saute in half lard and half butter until a delicate brown, or fry in 
deep, hot lard. Season with salt and pepper and send to the table 
very hot with quarters of lemon.

breads are the best. Soak in cold salt and water one hour. Then 
parboil for five or ten minutes according to their size. Take them 
out and throw them into cold milk (this whitens them) and let 
them get quite cold. Take them out of the milk and trim them 
from skin and flap. Then dip in an Qgg beaten up with three table- 
spoonfuls of milk. Dip in finely rolled bread crumbs and fry them 
to a nice golden brown color. Can be also served with a rich 
brown gravy. If the sweet-breads are especially large, are nice 
baked in the oven. Do not bread crumb but cover them with 
slices of bacon. Baste often with melted butter. When done, take 
out and serve with a rich brown sauce poured over. 

Devilled Kidneys. — Prepare two beef kidneys, cut up and 
parboil one hour. In an iron frying pan fry four slices of bacon 
cut into small pieces and one sliced onion until all are well 
browned. Then put in the bits of kidney and brown that also.

FOR THE CHAFING DISH 



REMARKS. 

The chafing dish is invaluable for serving a hasty luncheon ; 
after-theatre bites, or the Sunday night tea. and nowhere does 
it do better service than in the sick-room, where small quantities 
quickly prepared, and served hot will often tempt the invalid's 
appetite.

the hot pan, and stir until the cheese is melted. Break the eggs 
into a bowl ; pour them onto the cheese. Reduce the flame of the 
lamp and stir until done. Serve on hot toast. 



SANDWICHES AND CANAPES 



REMARKS. 



To make sandwiches properly, the bread should be about 
twenty-four hours old. Use a bread board, and sharp knife for 
cutting the sandwiches. If the butter is a little warm it will spread 
much easier and prevent the bread from crumbling. Spread the 
butter on the loaf before cutting each slice, and slice very thin. 
The shape of the sandwiches is a matter of taste, but the easiest 
to handle are the long narrow ones, or those cut diamond-shape, 
from which the crust has been removed. 

Meat Sandwiches. — Ordinary sandwiches from cold boiled 
ham, roast beef or lamb, are made by putting thin slices of meat 
between thin slices of bread and butter, and adding plenty of 
pepper and salt and sometimes mixed mustard. 

Egg Sandwiches. — Cut some thin slices of bread and butter, 
sprinkle them on the buttered side with mustard and chopped 
watercress. Cut some hard boiled eggs into thin slices ; cover one 
side of bread and butter, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and cover 
the other one over it. Trim the edges with a sharp knife, and cut 
into nice little triangular pieces. Wrap the sandwiches in lettuce 
leaves and then in wax paper, if wanted for travelling. 

Mushroom Sandwiches. — Cut mushrooms into small pieces 
and simmer in butter until tender (over-cooking toughens.) 
Season with paprika and salt, and add enough cream to make a 
good consistency for spreading. Allow it to just boil up ; add a 
little lemon juice, and spread between thin slices of toast. 

Club Sandwiches. — Prepare squares of toast with all crust 
removed. Broil very thin slices of ham or bacon, place on these a 
crisp lettuce leaf, spread with mayonnaise dressing, then a thin 
slice of the breast of chicken, slightly salted. Place then between 
the squares of toast and serve hot on folded napkin. — Mrs. 
Henry Wick. 



SANDWICHES AND CANAPES 95 

Anchovy Sandwiches. — Chop up into little pieces, but not 
too small, some anchovies. Also chop up an equal quantity of 
hard boiled eggs ; mix with mayonnaise dressing, and spread be- 
tween thin slices of bread, the crust all removed, and cut in dia- 
mond shape. 

Indian Sandwiches. — Pound two ounces of cold chicken 
with one ounce of cold ham or tongue. Moisten then in a stew 
pan with a little stock. Add a dessertspoonful of curry powder, 
and if liked a little hot, a little cayenne pepper. Let it simmer for 
ten minutes ; mix into smooth paste, and make into sandwiches 
by spreading between thin slices of bread. 

Tomato Sandwiches. — Tomato sandwiches are most re- 
freshing in hot weather. Cut some thin slices of bread and butter, 
sprinkle these with mustard and cress. Cut some thin slices of 
tomato, parallel with the core to avoid having rings from the core 
dropping out. Mix thin slices lightly in a good French dressing, 
lay these slices on the bread, sprinkle with mustard and cress, and 
cover over with the other slice of bread and butter. Cut these 
slices into squares or triangles with a very sharp knife, and place 
carefully on a dish. Place a border of parsley around the dish and 
ornament with some small round red tomatoes. Keep on ice until 
served. 

Cucumber Sandwiches. — Pare and chop fine fresh cucum- 
bers. To three parts of cucumbers, add one part of pimentos, also 
chopped fine. Salt well, and drain over night. Spread thin slices 
of bread with butter, then with mayonnaise, then spread on cu- 
cumbers and pimentos mixed. Place on this another piece of bread 
spread with butter. Cut into squares or triangles, trim the edges 
neatly, cutting ofif all crust. — Mrs. W. J. Sampson. 

Onion Sandwiches. — Use Spanish or Bermuda onions. Slice 
very thin, let stand in a good French dressing for three or four 
hours, and then drain. Sprinkle with pimentos and lay between 
thin slices of bread spread with butter. Trim the edges with a 
sharp knife and keep in a cool place until ready to serve. — Mrs. 
W. J. Sampson. 

Swiss Cheese Sandwiches. — Slice Swiss cheese very thin, 
spread with French mustard ; sprinkle with salt, and put between 
slices of bread and butter, with crust well trimmed off. 



96 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Jam Sandwiches. — Before cutting from the loaf, spread 
bread with butter, cut thin, and then into round shapes with 
bread cutter. Spread with raspberry jam, put together and serve. 

Brown Bread and Cheese Sandwiches. — Cut some thin 
slices of brown bread without crust. Mix thoroughly some soft 
cream cheese with chopped cress, and a little mayonnaise dressing. 
Put a layer of this between slices of bread and serve. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. — Wipe dry, crisp fresh lettuce leaves, 
place on slice of bread and butter. Spread with mayonnaise 
dressing, then lay on another slice of bread and butter, and trim 
with sharp knife into any fancy shapes. 

CANAPES 

Potted Meat Canapes. — Cut rounds of bread with biscuit 
cutter, and toast them or drop them two or three at a time into 
boiling fat. When golden brown lift them out with a wire spoon 
and drain on tissue paper. Open a can of potted tongue, ham or 
chicken, rub the contents to a pulp with the yolk of an egg. 
Season if desired, and spread on the rounds of bread. Set a pimola 
in the center of each, and serve as a first course. Anchovies and 
sardines may also be served in this form, omitting the egg, and 
flavoring with a few drops of lemon juice or Worcestshire sauce. 

Caviare Canapes. — Cut thin slices of bread and butter in 
fancy shapes with cutter. Spread with best imported caviare and 
equeeze over this a liberal supply of lemon juice. Have ready 
finely chopped parsley, two beets, the sifted yolk of hard boiled 
eggs. Arrange these in circles on the canapes ; then garnish with 
the white rings of hard boiled eggs, beets cut in fanciful shapes, 
and a pimola in the center of each. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Sabdine Canapes. — Skin and bone a box of sardines, and 
mash to a paste. Add lemon juice, salt and red pepper, and 
minced parsley to taste, and spread on thin slices of bread and 
butter. Cut in fancy shapes with a tin cutter. 

Anchovy Canapes. — Cut thin slices of bread into rounds. 
Toast and spread with anchovy paste, which can be purchased at 
the grocer's. Chop the whites of cold boiled eggs very fine ; sift 
the yolks of the eggs ; arrange these in alternate circles around 
the top of canape, placing a ring of hard boiled white of egg in 
center with a whole anchovy curled in the center of that. 



BREAD, YEAST AND ROLLS 



REMARKS. 

There is nothing truer to be said than that bread is the staff 
of Hfe, and to insure its being good great care should be taken in 
the preparation. First the flour must be excellent ; the yeast must 
be fresh (otherwise the bread will be flat or sour) ; the batter 
must be of the right consistency and temperature (luke warm). 
When the yeast is ready, put in and keep in a warm place until 
light. The kneading should be thorough and just the proper 
amount of flour used in stiffening. Small loaves are generally 
considered preferable and should be quite light before being put 
in the oven. The oven should be of even temperature and is all 
important. Bake slow and the length of time according to the 
size of the loaves. After baking, leave exposed to the air until 
thoroughly cold. Then put away in a clean stone crock and keep 
covered. 

Yeast. — A double handful of hops, one-half dozen large po- 
tatoes. Boil together in one-half gallon of water until done.' Strain 
and mash onto one-half cupful of ginger, small cup of flour and 
one cup of brown sugar, and half a cup of salt. Let stand until 
cool then add one cupful of good yeast. The next day cork up 
tight in a jug. — Mrs. Wm. Bonnell. 

Yeast. — Take two good-sized potatoes, grate them raw. Add 
one-half teacup of white sugar, one teaspoon of salt, a little ginger. 
Pour over the mixture one-half pint of boiling water in which one 
tablespoonful of hops has been boiled. Save half a cup each time 
to start anew. — Mrs. Wm. Edwards. 

Yeast and Bread. — Boil six medium-sized potatoes in a lit- 
tle more than three pints of water. When done, mash and add 
one quart of flour and scald with the boiling water. When cool 
put in one cent's worth of baker's fresh yeast. Stir it down quite 
often through the day and it will be ready for use by night. 



98 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

For the Bread. — Put the flour into a wooden bowl as it will 
keep warm better in that than in tin. Take a quart of new milk 
(if skim milk is used it must be scalded in summer) and a tea- 
cupful of the yeast. Pour into the flour and thicken with a little 
of it. Wrap the bowl up in a woolen blanket and keep in a warm 
room. Make up in the morning as soon as it is perfectly light. 
Add salt and knead it thoroughly and mold over into the pans. 
Be careful not to let it get too warm. — Mrs. Sidney Strong. 

Yeast and Bread. — Take ten large potatoes. Pare and put 
them in kettle with three quarts of water. Put a pint of hops in 
a thin muslin bag in the same kettle with the potatoes. Boil until 
potatoes are soft. Then pour the water from this kettle boiling 
hot over a pint of flour in a crock. Squeeze all the strength from 
the hops. Mash the potatoes, add a quart of cold water to them 
and put through a colander into the crock and add one-half teacup 
of salt, a cup of sugar, one tablespoon of ginger. Let it stand for 
two days until it stops fermenting and settles. Then put into a 
jug, cork tight and keep in a cool place. — Mrs. M. Adclia Wick. 

For the Bread. — Pare and boil six good-sized potatoes, drain 
off the water, mash fine and pour over them about three pints of 
cold water and run through a colander. Add flour imtil this is 
a thin batter. Then put in a coflfeecup of yeast from the jug. Let 
stand until it rises, then stir into flour as much as you can with 
spoon, and let rise again. Work in enough more flour to make 
as stiff as bread and let rise third time. When light this time work 
out into loaves and let rise. All the flour must be sifted. — Mrs. 
M. A delta Wick. 

Yeast and Bread. — Two handfuls of hops, two of flour, one- 
half dozen large potatoes, one cup of sugar, one teaspoonful of 
ginger. Boil the hops and potatoes and pour the hop water onto 
the flour scalding hot. Mix with the other ingredients. When 
cool, add a teacupful of yeast. It will be ready for use in twenty- 
four hours. 

For the Bread. — Take five small potatoes, a little over two 
quarts of water. Boil till done. Three iron spoonfuls of flour in 
crock. Pour enough of potato water on flour to get all the lumps 
out. Put potatoes through colander and pour on remainder of 
potato water. When luke warm stir in yeast. Wrap up warm 
and rise until morning. In the morning put in a little salt and 



BREAD, YEAST AND ROLLS 99 

enough flonr to make still. Knead well and let rise. Then knead 
again and make into loaves. Let rise and hake.— Mrs. M. I. Arms. 

Five Hour Bread.— One cake of Fleishman's yeast broken 
up and dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of luke warm water. Take 
one-half pint of morning's milk into which put one tablespoonful 
of salt. Scald with one pint of boiling water; when luke warm 
add the dissolved yeast ; then stir in three pints of sifted Pittsburg 
flour and knead for fifteen minutes. If this quantity of flour is 
not sufficient to keep the dough from sticking to the board add on 
the start-out a little more flour. The dough should be satiny and 
full of bubbles when sufficiently kneaded. With a small brush 
dipped in melted butter grease the pans; put in the dough and 
then go over that with the brush. Cover well first with towel and 
then with a flannel blanket and let stand to rise three hours in 
temperature of seventy-five degrees. Mold into loaves, kneading 
slightly. Brush with butter, set to rise for one hour in same tem- 
perature. Allow forty-five minutes for baking bread ; twenty-five 
minutes for rolls and biscuit. This recipe makes two loaves of 
bread and two pans of biscuit. — Mrs. Hal stead, Cincinnati. 

Bread With a Starter.— One large or two small potatoes 
and all the water to pint or more ; squeeze through ricer, add one 
small handful of sugar, two of salt, one pint of water and a pint 
jar of starter. Also a cake of "Yeast Foam" dissolved in a cup 
of warm water. Have the water just luke-warm before adding 
yeast and starter. Let stand over night. In the morning put flour 
near the fire, stir up sponge, take out a jar full for next time, set 
sponge on the stove until just luke-warm, then add flour and knead 
fifteen minutes. Let that rise very lig-ht before making into 
loaves. This recipe makes three loaves of bread and a pan of 
biscuit. Let the loaves rise well and bake in a slow oven from 
three-quarters to one hour. — Mrs. P. B. Oiven. 

Five Hour Bread. — For each loaf : One-half pint of milk, 
one-half pint of water, one teaspoonful salt and a little sugar, one 
cake of compressed yeast. Dissolve yeast in three tablespoonfuls 
of tepid water. Scald milk and set aside to cool. Add the \yater 
and when mixture is cool, add dissolved yeast, also salt and sugar. 
Stir in enough flour to knead. Knead tvv^enty-five minutes. Set 
to rise about three hours. When light make into loaves and put 
to rise about one hour. Bake in moderate oven. — Mrs. Wm. A. 
Smith.

Light Biscuit. — In kneading bread set aside a small loaf for 
biscuits. Into this work a heaping tablespoonful of lard and butter 
mixed and a teaspoon of sugar. The more it is worked the whiter 
it will be. As it rises mold it down twice before making into 
biscuit. Roll out and cut with a biscuit cutter. The dough should 
be quit soft. — Mrs. John McCurdy. 

Light Biscuit. — Take about as much dough, after it is light, 
as would make a good-sized loaf of bread. Put in a pie pan. Mix

solved in a little water. Then sift in flour to make batter, (about 
three cups), and beat ten minutes. Let it stand in a warm place 
about three hours and then add flour to make dough a little softer 
than bread and knead well. After standing again until light (about 
three hours) roll out dough in a sheet, cut with a round cutter, press 
a raisin in the middle of each clear down to the bottom. Spread

PASTRY 



REMARKS. 

In making pastry it is all important to have good butter and 
good lard and both must be chilled until perfectly firm. Pastry is 
better made in a cool place and ice water used for mixing. Do not 
touch with the hands until ready to roll out and then as little 
as possible. Use a knife for mixing. Pastry can be kept for 
several days by setting in a very cold place. In baking do not have 
a hot oven but bake moderately slow. With the exception of mince 
pie, all pastry should be eaten the day it is baked. This will keep 
a week and then heated before serving. 

Puff Paste. — One pound of flour, five ounces of flour for the 
board and rolling pin ; half a pound of butter, half a pound of lard, 
two gills of ice water. Sift the pound of flour in a two-quart bowl, 
cut the butter and lard through it with a knife into pieces about 
the size of an unshelled almond ; scatter the water over the whole 
and mix lightly with the knife. Flour space on the board twenty- 
four inches long by eighteen wide. Put the rough dough in the 
center of this space, flour the pin and roll the dough nearly large 
enough to cover the flour. With a small sieve, sift a light, barely 
perceptible coating of flour over the whole sheet. Then fold it in 
thirds lengthwise and across, making a piece about eight inches 
long and seven inches wide. Turn it over and put more flour 
under it and over the board ; roll it out again, sift it with flour and 
fold. Roll it out the third time, sift and roll lightly in the form 
of a scroll. Cut it across the center, lay it on a plate and leave it 
on the ice for fifteen minutes or longer, when it is ready for use. — 
Boston Cook Book. 

Quick Puff Paste. — One pound of butter, one pound of 
flour, one teaspoon salt, nearly one cup of ice water. Have flour 
very cold. Divide the butter into four parts. Rub into the flour 
with the salt (one-quarter) or one part butter; add water to make 



112 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

your paste mix and handle lightly. Roll into one sheet then spread 
this with the second part of butter, sprinkle a little flour, fold over 
and roll again ; spread the third part of butter and proceed as be- 
fore; roll over, roll again and spread with the last or fourth 
quarter of butter ; fold, roll and cut into pieces sufficient to make 
your pie, or what you wish. Pastry must be very cold, it is best 
to make it in a cold room, and the oven should be very hot. — Mrs. 
A. E. Kauffman. 

Pie Crust. — One pound of flour, three-fourths of a pound of 
shortening (part butter, part lard), one cup of cold water, a pinch 
of salt, cut shortening into flour well before adding water. Put 
on board, roll, then fold. Roll and fold a number of times. Keep 
in icebox a long time. — Mrs. P. B. Owen. 

Pastry. — To one cup of water add one-half cup of lard, a 
little salt and some flour. Mix together with a knife. When stiff 
enough, roll out on a board, spread on with a knife a layer of lard 
and sift over a little flour. Roll all together and then roll out on 
the board again, repeating this for three or four times. The entire 
amount of lard used for one cup of water should be about two cups. 
This will make three pies. — Mrs. G. B. Woodman. 

Mince Meat. — The meat should be boiled the day before it is 
prepared for pies. Boil one large fresh tongue until tender. Sea- 
son when put on with one large spoonful of salt and one small 
spoonful of pepper ; boil almost dry. Do not take off the skin vmtil 
you are ready to use it. Boil also five pounds of lean beef tender. 
Save the liquor from the beef (which should be boiled down to 
about a pint) and put in when mixing three pounds of suet, 
one-half peck of Greening apples ; chop all of them very fine separ- 
ately ; then mix and add one-half cup of butter cut fine, a little salt, 
a quart of Orleans molasses, four pounds of granulated sugar, two 
quarts of boiled cider, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one 
of cloves, one of mace and two nutmegs (grated) ; four pounds of 
seeded raisins, three of currants and one of citron (cut fine) ; the 
grated rind and juice of two oranges, one pint of French brandy 
and one pint of Madeira wine. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

Mince Meat. — Two pounds of lean beef boiled. When cold

CUSTARDS, CREAMS AND ICES I45 

Chartreuse D'Oranges. — Make a very clear orange jelly 
with one and a half pints of water, six oranges, sugar to taste, one 
wine-glass of sherry, one and one-half ounces of gelatine ; divide 
three or four oranges into quarters and with a sharp knife remove 
every vestige of skin of any sort — also the seeds ; have two plain 
molds, one about one and a fourth inches more in diameter than 
the other; pour a very little of the jelly at the bottom of the large 
mold, place in this a layer of orange quarters (if too thick split in 
two lengthways), cover with more jelly, but only just enough to 
get a smooth surface ; set on ice to set ; when it is quite firm, put in 
the small mold inside of the large one, taking care to place exactly 
in the middle, so that the vacant place between the two molds be 
exactly of the same width ; in the vacant place put more orange 
quarters, filling up with jelly until the whole space is filled up ; place 
the mold on the ice, and proceed to whip one pint of cream with 
one-half ounce of dissolved gelatine, and some sweetened orange 
juice, which must be added to it a very little at a time, else the 
cream will not rise in a froth ; when the cream s ready and the 
jelly set, remove the inner mold by pouring warm water into it, 
and fill up the space of the chartreuse with whipped cream. Set 
on ice for an hour, turn out and serve. — Mrs. Henry Wick. 

Syrup for Ice Cream. — Put a large funnel over a quart 
Mason jar, lay a small piece of cheese cloth in it and then put in 
two pounds of granulated sugar in funnel. Press one pint of 
strawberry juice from fresh, ripe berries, make a small hole in the 
center of the sugar and pour the juice into it, letting it drip into 
the jar. When it is done dripping, pour the juice again over what 
sugar is left in the funnel and let drip through again. When done 
it should be about the consistency of honey. To every cup of juice 
add three tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine or any liquor that is 
preferred. Put in a bottle and seal. Keep in a cool place. If kept 
cool, will keep any length of time. 

Raspberries or pineapples or other small fruits could be used 
in the same way. — Mrs. S. Stevenson. 



BEVERAGES 



Coffee. — Coffee is much better mixed, one part Java to one 
part Mocha, or one part Java to one part Rio. Wash and pick over 
carefully and dry off in a moderate oven for some time, then 
brown fast in a quick oven, watching closely, and stirring often 
to prevent any of the grains becoming too brown. When of a 
nice rich brown, stir in a piece of butter about the size of a walnut 
and bottle tight. To brown coffee fresh every day is much nicer. 
Allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee to each person and one 
extra spoonful to every six ; put into the coffee pot, beat up an 
egg light with a little cold water, pour a part over the grounds 
and mix up well ; if eggs are plenty, use all the egg, as it will 
make the coffee much richer. Next pour on the boiling water, 
allowing for each person one pint ; set on the front of the stove 
until it boils, then set back where it will boil slowly for twenty 
minutes. — Mrs. Jonathan Warner. 

Vienna Coffee. — Leach or filter the coffee through a French 
filter, or any of the many coffee pots that filter instead of boiling 
the coffee; allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee for each 
person, and one extra for the pot. Put one quart of cream into 
milk boiler, or, if you have none, into a pitcher in a pail or boiling 
water ; put it where the water will keep boiling, beat the white 
of an egg to a froth, then add to the egg three tablespoonfuls of 
cold milk, mix the egg and cold milk thoroughly together ; when 
hot, remove the cream from the fire and add the egg and cold milk ; 
stir it all together briskly for a minute or two, and then serve. 
This will give a cup of coffee very nearly equal to that we drank 
at the Vienna bakery at the Centennial. — Mrs. Henry Ward 
Beecher. 

Iced Cafe au Lait. — Add enough cold black coffee to milk 
to give it the desired strength and flavor. Sweeten to taste and 
let it stand on ice until ready to serve. Serve it in glasses instead 
of cups. Any coffee left from breakfast prepared in this way

for ten minutes, add as much boiling water as is needed and take 
to the table.— Mr.y. R. McMillan.

four teaspoonfuls of Ceylon tea to one quart of boiling water, five 
tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, two tablespoonfuls of orange juice, 
tw^o cupfuls of sugar — granulated — one pint of appolinaris water. 
Stir the lemon and orange juice together, put these in a puncn 
bowl with the tea, the appolinaris water, and a couple of large 
pieces of ice. If possible add a handful of raspberries or pine- 
apple dice. — Mrs. S. J. McElevey.

grate one-half cake of Baker's chocolate ; make a paste with a 
little hot water, stir in slowly ; add to this gradually the hot milk ; 
sweeten to taste, putting sugar in the paste ; also a little vanilla. 
Add part of the cream preparation, which is made thus : Beat 
the whites of three eggs very stiff ; add a little sugar to the 
whites, but not as much as for icing; to this add one pint of 
whipped cream. Boil chocolate, milk and cream oreoaration until 
thick and smooth. The other half of whipped cream is to be 
used on top of cups. — Mrs. W. Scott Bonnell. 

Chocolate. — To a small cup of new milk use a heaping tea- 
spoonful of grated chocolate, scant teaspoon of sugar — propor- 
tion for one person. Put milk on in double-boiler to get scalding 
hot ; mix chocolate and sugar in a bowl, put several teaspoonfuls 
of chocolate extra, to make it a little richer. Take some hot milk 
and stir chocolate and sugar smooth, then gradually add this to 
hot milk ; cook twenty minutes. A drop or two of vanilla is some- 
times added at the last. — Mrs. G. S. Peck.

CAKES 



REMARKS. 

Use the best of materials for cake. The pulverized sugar 
should always be sifted. Sift the flour. Beat the whites and 
yolks of eggs separately. When fruit is used, sprinkle with flour. 
Stir butter and sugar to a cream. If baking powder is used sift 
it well through the flour. While the cake is baking, no air must 
be permitted to get into the oven unless when necessary to look at 
the cake as it is apt to make it fall. The heat of the oven should 
be even and regular. When cake is done, it can be tested by stick- 
ing a clean broomstraw into it ; if nothing adheres to the straw, the 
cake is done.

CANDIES 



CocoANUT Candy. — Grate very fine a sound cocoaniit; 
spread it on a dish and let it dry naturally for three days as h 
will not bear the heat of an oven and too oily for use when freshly 
broken. Four ounces will be sufficient for a pound of sugar, but 
more can be used to pleasure. To one pound of sugar take one- 
half pint of water, a very little of white of egg, and then pour 
over the sugar. Let it stand for a short time, then place over a 
very clear fire and let it boil for a few moments. Then set it 
aside until the scum has subsided. Clear it off and boil the sugar 
until very thick, then put in the nut, stir and mix it well and do 
not quit for an instant until it is finished. The pan should not 
be placed on the fire but over it as the nut is liable to brown with 
too fierce a heat. 

CocoANUT Balls. — Mix well one cup of grated cocoanut and 
one cup of confectioners' sugar. To this add one-half table- 
spoonful of water and one-half tablespoonful of lemon. Form 
into balls. — Miss E. E. Evans.

water, one-half cup of grated chocolate, three-fourths of a cup of 
butter. Let boil without stirring until it snaps in water. Pour 
into pans and let cool. — Mrs. M. C. Wick. 

Chocolate Caramels. — One-half pound of grated chocolate, 
two teacupfuls of sugar, one-half cup of milk and water, a lump 
of butter, one teaspoonful of alum. — Miss Laura Wick. 

Chocolate Pralines. — Four cups of brown sugar, two cups 
of milk, one cup of English walnuts, butter size of a walnut, one 



CANDIES 175 

tablespoonful of vanilla, a square of baker's chocolate grated. Boil 
sugar and milk ten minutes, then add butter. Boil until it gathers 
in water (but not crack). Stir while boiling and after it is taken 
off until it begins to thicken. Then add nuts and vanilla. Pour 
on buttered platter and cut in squares. — Mrs. D. C. Stezvart. 

Chocolate Fudge. — Two cups of granulated sugar, one cup 
of sweet milk, one-half cake of chocolate, butter size of a walnut, 
vanilla flavoring. Stir while cooking and when it is boiled, till 
it hardens when tried in water, take from the stove and beat hard 
until nearly cold. Then pour into pans until cold. 

Almond Candy. — Proceed in the same way as for cocoanut 
candy. Let the almonds be perfectly dry and do not throw them 
into the sugar until they approach the candying point. 

To Candy Nuts. — Three cups of sugar, one cup of water. 
Boil until it hardens when dropped in water, then flavor with 
lemon. It must not boil after the lemon is put in. Put a nut on 
the end of a fine knitting needle, dip in the syrup, take out and 
turn on the needle until it is cold. If the candy gets cold, set on 
the stove for a few moments. Malaga grapes and oranges 
quartered may be candied in the same way. — Miss Sallie Arms. 

Sugar Candy. — Six cups of white sugar, one cup of vinegar, 
one cup of water, a tablespoonful of butter put in at the last with 
one teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water. Boil without 
stirring one-half hour. Flavor to suit the taste. — Mrs. C. H. 
Gilman. 

Cream Candy — Four cups of sugar, two cups of water, three- 
fourths of a cup of vinegar, one cup of cream or rich milk, a 
piece of butter the size of an &gg, two teaspoonfuls of vanilla, a 
pinch of soda. Let it boil until it cracks in water. Put into pans ; 
when cool enough to work, work until very light. — Miss Jennie 
Arms. 

Maple Candy. — Four cups of maple syrup. Boil until it 
cracks in water but do not stir. Just before taking from the fire, 
put in a piece of butter the size of an egg. If preferred waxy, do 
not let it cook so long.

one-half cup of butter. Boil until done. — Miss Hattie Arms. 



176 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Marsh MALLOWS. — Dissolve one-half pound of gum arabic in 
one pint of water. Strain. Add one-half pound of granulated 
sugar. Place over the fire and stir constantly until the sugar 
is dissolved and the mixture takes the consistency of honey. Add 
graduallly the whites of four eggs well beaten, stirring the mix- 
ture steadilv until it will not stick to the fingers. Pour into a 
pan slightly dusted with starch. When cool, divide into small 
squares. 

Salted Almonds. — Blanch one pound of shelled almonds by 
pouring boiling water over them and letting them stand a few 
moments, when the skin can be easily removed. Place almonds 
in a dripping pan, set in the oven and when hot put over them in 
little bits a piece of butter the size of an egg. Stir well to cover 
all the nuts with butter and keep in the oven until a light brown 
and crisp. Then sprinkle liberally with salt. Keep in a dry 
place. 



Canned Fruits, Preserves and Jellies 



REMARKS. 



All fruits should be fresh and ripe. Granulated sugar should 
always be used and also a porcelain kettle. Put the bottles in 
a pan or kettle of cold water, place on the stove until the water 
is boiling before filling with the fruit. Do not use an iron spoon. 

In preserving, a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. For 
canning, three-fourths of a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit 
and a little water. Preserved fruits can be put in tumblers or 
small jars covered with egg papers or melted wax run over. In 
canning fruit great care should be taken to have the jars perfectly 
air tight. Keep in a cool, dark place. 

To Can Peaches. — Pare and halve the peaches, pack them in 
tin cans as close as they can possibly be put. Make a syrup of 
six pounds of sugar to one gallon of cold water. Let this stand 
until well dissolved, then pour the cold syrup over the peaches 
until the cans are even full, after which solder it oerfectly tight. 
Place the cans in a boiler, cover well with cold water, set it on 
the fire and let the water boil five minutes. Then take the cans 
out and turn them upside down. One gallon of syrup will do one 
dozen cans. 

Rich Canned Peaches. — Pare and stone peaches about 
enough for two jars at a time (if many are pared they will be- 
come dark colored standing), rinse in cold water, then cook in 
a rich syrup of sugar and water about fifteen or twenty minutes, 
or until they are clear. Put into your jars all that part not broken, 
fill up with the hot syrup (about as thick as corn molasses) and 
seal. Same syrup will do to cook two or three more jars. After 
the syrup becomes dark, this with broken peaches, can be used 
for marmalade or peach butter. 

Same rule can be used for pears, plums and all light fruits 
that you desire rich. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 



178 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Green Gage Plums. — After stemming and washing the 
fruit, fill the jars full, placing them in a boiler of cold water, 
just enough not to have the water boil over the top of the jars 
into the fruit. After boiling one-half hour, or until the fruit 
begins to be tender, lift out the jars and turn off the juice that 
may accumulate into a porcelain kettle, and sufficient sugar to make 
a rich syrup. When it boils, fill up the jars, let them stand in the 
boiling water ten or fifteen minutes longer, then lift out one at a 
time and seal. All kinds of plums are nice put up in the same 
way. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

Cherries. — Take Morello cherries, wash, and remove the 
pits, allow a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Make a syrup 
of sugar with the juice and sufficient water to cover the cherries. 
Boil from five to ten minutes, turn into bottles and seal. Some 
prefer one pint of sugar to one quart of pitted cherries. — Mrs. C. 
D. 'Arms. 

Strawberries. — Procure fresh, large strawberries when in 
their prime but not so ripe as to be very soft. Hull and weigh 
them. Take an equal weight of sugar, make a syrup and when 
boiling hot pour in the berries. A small quantity should only be 
done at a time. If crowded they will become mashed. Let them 
boil about twenty minutes or half an hour. Turn into tumblers 
or small jars and seal wath egg papers while hot. — Mrs. M. I. 
Arms. 

Quinces. — Select fair, mild apple quinces (the inferior ones 
can be used for jelly or marmalade), pare and cut into quarters, 
removing the core. For each pound of them take three-fourths of 
a pound of sugar, a quart of cold water ; dissolve the sugar in the 
water over a moderate fire. Let it boil, then remove from the fire ; 
when cool, put in the quinces. If there is not more than enough 
water to cover them, more should be added so the syrup will be 
thin. If too rich the quinces will be hard and shrink. Boil them 
gently until a broom straw will go through them itself. Keep 
them covered while boiling that they may be light colored. Put 
in bottles and seal. — Mrs. C. D. Arms. 

To Can Pumpkin. — Cut the pumpkin in halves and steam. 
When thoroughly cooked scrape from the shell and put through 
the colander. For every cup of pumpkin add three-fourths of a 
cup of granulated sugar, one teaspoonful of cinnamon, one-four^th 



CANNED FRUITS, PRESERVES AND JELLIES 1 79 

of a teaspoonful of ginger. Cook until quite thick. Put in Mason 
jars. For pumpkin pies. — Mrs. C. A. Ensign. 

Pineapple Preserve. — Pare and core and cut in small slices 
on a slaw cutter. To a pound of pineapple put one pound of 
sugar. Let it boil twenty minutes, put in jars and cover with 
egg papers. — Miss Laura Wick. 

Pineapple Jam. — Pare, core and grate fine on a grater. Then 
proceed as for pineapple preserve. — Miss Laura Wick. 

Raspberry Jam. — Allow one pound of sugar to a pound of 
berries, and one pint of currant juice to five pounds of berries, 
adding one extra pound of sugar for each pint of currant juice. 
Mix the berries and sugar in layers, then mash with potato masher. 
Add currant juice and let boil one-half hour. Put in tumblers 
and cover with egg papers while hot. Make blackberry, straw- 
berry and currant jam in the same way, omitting the currant 
juice. — Mrs. M. L Arms. 

Strawberry or Raspberry Jam. — To one pound of berries 
allow one and one-fourth pounds of sugar. Heat an earthen bowl 
hot on the stove, then remove it from the stove and put into it 
the berries and sugar and beat them hard with wooden spoon for 
as much as an hour and a half. Do not cook at all. Put in jars 
with egg papers. — Miss Jennie Bonnell, England. 

To Can Raspberries and Blackberries. — To a quart of 
berries allow one pint of sugar. Boil fifteen minutes and put in 
air-tight jars. — Mrs. M. L Arms. 

Cherry Jam. — To each pound of cherries allow three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar. Stone them, and as you do so. throw the 
sugar gradually into the dish with them. Cover and let them set 
over night. Next day boil slowly until the cherries and sugar 
form a smooth thick mass. Put up in jars. — Miss Leslie. 

Grapes. — Stew, wash and weigh tlie fruit. For preserves 
add one pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. For canning, one- 
half pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Remove the pulp, put 
the skins and pulp in separate dishes. Cook the pulp and strain 
through a sieve, then add the skins and sugar. For canning 
cook fifteen minutes. For preserving a little longer. — Mrs. R. 
McMillan.

THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 



Grape Jelly. — Grapes to be used just before they are ripe 
and just turning. Stem the grapes and sHghtly cook them. Then 
strain and take a pint of sugar to a pint of juice. It makes the 
jelly of a light red color and much finer flavored than ripe grapes. 
—Mrs. P. T. Caldivell. 

Apple Jelly. — Peel two dozen Golden Pippins. Boil 
them with one quart of water and half an ounce of isinglass. 
When the isinglass is dissolved and the apples reduced to a pulp, 
strain. Add the juice of a lemon and the grated rind with a 
pound and a quarter of loaf sugar. Boil together twenty minutes 
and strain. — Miss Lizzie Bonnell. 

Apple Jelly. — Quarter the apples and cover them with water. 
Cook and strain them and to a pint of juice put three-fourths of 
a pound of sugar. Boil twenty minutes and flavor with lemon 
or vanilla. — Mrs. J. G. Butler. 

Crab Apple Jelly. — Procure the Siberian crab. Select those 
that are perfectly formed, wash in water and pour over them just 
enough water to cover. Let them cook until soft, then strain 
through a jelly-bag. Add one pound of sugar to one pint of 
juice and let boil twenty minutes. 

Currant Jelly. — Choose your currants before they are too 
ripe. Wash clean and then strain the juice from them through 
a jelly-bag (without cooking them) by mashing them with a 
potato masher, put a pound of sugar to one pint of juice. Boil 
twenty minutes. Seal with egg in tumblers. Another way of 
making this is to let the juice boil twenty minutes before adding 
the sugar. After adding the sugar, let it boil up for a few 
moments. 

Orange Marmalade. — Separate the pulp from the skin. 
Boil the skin until very tender, then chop fine. Separate as 
much as possible the white part from the yellow, using only the 
yellow. Then to one pound of pulp and skins add one pound of 
sugar. Boil twenty minutes. — Miss Lizzie Bonnell. 

Orange Marmalade. — Six oranges, three lemons ; slice them. 
Add three pints of water to each pint of fruit. Let oranges and 
lemons stand in the water over night. Next day cook until tender. 
Let stand twenty-four hours, then add one pint of sugar to each 
pint of fruit. Cook until it jellies, but not too thick. — Mrs. S. J. 
McElevey. 



CANNED FRUITS, PRESERVES AND JELLIES l8l

of water, six pounds of sugar ; slice oranges very thin ; put in a 
crock and let stand in the water over night ; boil half away and 
then add sugar and boil until yellow. — Mrs. F. G. Evans. 

Orange Marmalade. — Two dozen Messina oranges, one 
dozen lemons. Wash the fruit, slice up as thin as possible, remove 
all seeds, cover closely for thirty-six hours. Add the water and 
boil two hours from time of boiling. Add the sugar and boil 
again one hour from time of boiling. — Mrs. T. R. Aiken. 

Green Grape Conserve. — Three pounds of green grapes, 
seed, eight cups of sugar, one-half pint of raisins and the juice of 
two lemons, one pint of water and stuffed English walnuts. Boil 
twenty minutes. Conserve can be made of any fruit. Especially 
fine of strawberries. — Mrs. D. C. Stewart. 

Sunshine Strawberries. — Strawberries three pounds, sugar 
three pounds, boiling water two cups. Add the sugar and water 
together until it spins a thread, then add strawberries, cook fif- 
teen or twenty minutes after they boil. Then spread on large 
platters, place in the sun until the strawberry is very thick, then 
put in Mason jars. — Mrs. J. L. Wick. 

Quince Marmalade. — Ten pounds of ripe, yellow quinces. 
Wash clean, pare and core them and cut them into small pieces. 
To each pound of quinces allow half a pound of white sugar. Cut 
the parings and put into a kettle with enough water to cover 
them. Boil slowly until quite soft ; then, having put the quinces 
with the sugar into a porcelain kettle, strain over them through 
a cloth the liquid from the parings and cover. Boil the whole 
over a clear fire until it becomes quite smooth and thick, keeping it 
covered except when you are skimming it, and watching and 
stirring closely to prevent sticking at the bottom. Pour into 
porcelain dishes and when cold can be sliced. 

Apple Marmalade. — Twelve pounds of apples, three pounds 
of brown sugar, three lemons. Boil slowly. Mash well. — Mrs. 
R. W. Tayler. 

Apple Jam. — Ten pounds of best cooking apples; pare and

put in water to preserve their color. — Mrs. R. W. Tayler. 



1 82 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Apple Butter. — One-half bushel of Pippin apples, one gallon 
of sweet fresh cider. Cook together thoroughly and put through 
a colander. Place on the fire and add six pounds of white sugar. 
Stir constantly while cooking to prevent burning. In the course 
of two or three hours, take a little out in a dish and if it has a 
watery appearance it should be cooked longer or until quite thick. 
—Mrs. R. McMillan. 

Plum Butter. — One-half peck of plums, one-half bushel of 
sweet apples. Cook the apples and plums in separate kettles 
until quite soft, only putting in enough water to prevent sticking 
to the bottom of the kettle. When soft, put through a colander 
and then to each pound of mixture allow three-fourths of a pound 
of white sugar. Let it cook for a short time and bottle. — Mrs. C, 
D. Arms. 

Peach Butter. — To one bushel of peaches allow from eight 
to ten pounds of granulated sugar; pare and halve the peaches. 
Put in the kettle and stir constantly (to prevent sticking to the 
kettle) until perfectly smooth and rather thick. A part of the 
peach stones thrown in and cooked with the peaches give it a nice 
flavor and they can be afterwards skimmed out. Add the sugar 
a short time before taking from the fire. Put in jars and cover 
tight. Peaches for butter should be neither too mealy nor too 
juicy. 

To Preserve Watermelon Rind. — After cutting your rind 
properly, boil it in clean water with vine leaves between each 
layer. A piece of alum the size of a hickory nut is sufficient for a 
kettle full. After boiling it put it into ice water to cool. Then 
repeat this a second time, each time putting it to cool, each time 
boiling one hour. Prepare the syrup with one and one-fourth 
pounds of sugar to each pound of fruit. Green ginger boiled in 
the water you make your syrup, will flavor it, or three lemons to 
six pounds of fruit. If the syrup thickens too fast, add a little 
water. The rind should be boiled in the water until clear and 
green. — Mrs. R. W. Tayler. 

To Preserve Watermelon Rind. — Soak the fruit in salt 
water three days, in fresh water three days. Boil in alum water, 
soak in fresh water over a day and night, changing the water 
several time. Boil in ginger water. To one pound of fruit add

one and one-fourth pounds of sugar and put in ginger and mHce, 
Flavor with oil of lemon. — Miss Lide Wick. 

Brandied Fruit. — Take two quarts of California brandy. 
Put it into a crock at the beginning of the fruit season. Commence 
by putting in the brandy one pound of pineapples (pared and 
quartered and then sliced on a slaw cutter very thin). To each 
pound of fruit add or.e pound of granulated sugar. The next 
fruit in turn is strawberries. Add this same proportion. Then 
follow cherries (which are stoned), raspberries, currants, black- 
berries, peaches and plums, etc. Add to the brandy without cook- 
ing and to each pound of fruit, one pound of sugar. Add also one 
pound each of raisins and citron, the latter sliced thin. Stir fre- 
quently to dissolve sugar. Keep the crock covered and in a cool 
place. 

Spiced Gooseberries. — Six quarts of berries, nine pounds 
of sugar, one pint of vinegar, one tablespoonful each of cinnamon, 
allspice and cloves. Dissolve half the sugar, put in berries, cook- 
ing for an hour and a half. Then put in remainder of sugar and 
just before taking from the fire add spices and vinegar. — Mrs. S. 
J. McElevey. _ 

Chipped Pear Marmalade. — Eight pounds of pears, peel 
and slice very thin. Eight pounds of white sugar, one-half pound 
of green ginger root (scraped and cut fine), four lemons boiled

root and sugar. Boil one and one-half hours. — Mrs. T. R. Akin. 

Ginger Pears. — Eight pounds of pears (hard), eight pounds 
of sugar, one-fourth pound of ginger root (green), juice of six 
lemons and rind of two. Let sugar boil up with one and one- 
half pints of water, add ginger, lemon and pears cut in quarters. 
Boil slowly about three hours. — Mrs. A. E. Kauffmann.

seed, celery seed and raw ginger ; when heated pour over the 
pickles, add grape or cabbage leaves. Grated horseradish may be 
used also. — Airs. John Morris. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Make a brine of salt and water, put in 
the cucumbers and let them remain nine days, pouring off the 
brine and scalding it every second day. On the ninth day, take 
some cider vinegar, which, if very strong, dilute with one-third 
water ; have it boiling hot and pour over the pickles, having first 
covered them with vine or cabbage leaves ; then take cider vinegar 
and sweeten, say from one and one-half poimds to two pounds of 
sugar to one gallon of vinegar. Have ready the spices and put all 
into the vinegar. While heating turn off the first vinegar and pour 
this over them. Exclude them entirely from the air. If like, add 
grated horseradish. — Airs. John D. Morris. 

Cucumber Pickles. — Take small cucumbers, put them in a 
large stone jar; to a four-gallon jar full put enough water to 
cover. One quart of salt and alum the size of a walnut. Turn off 
the brine and scald every day, putting it on boiling hot for nine 
days. Then wash, and soak over night, if too salt. Put into jars

brine for twenty hours. Then strain and pour on boiling vinegar 
sufficient to just cover the pickle, into which has been put the 
above spices and turmeric. Mix a pint bowl of mustard as for the 
table, and add after the pickle has cooled. To get the required 
quantity of vinegar, measure the brine when turned off. The 
vinegar should only just cover the pickle. — Mrs. G. W. Hale,

COOKERY FOR THE SICK 



Beef Tea. — Very nice beef tea is made by cutting up tender, 
juicy beef into pieces about one inch square; put into a strong 
bottle, cork tightly and set in a kettle of cold water. Boil it about 
two hours ; the fluid then obtained will be of the pure nutriment of 
the meat, and the tonic effects are powerful. 

Beef Tea. — Cut raw beef into small pieces, cover with cold 
water and set on the back of the stove where it will not boil, until 
all the juice is extracted from the beef. When wanted for use 
skim off all the fat, strain, season, and let come to a boil. — Mrs. 
R. McMillan. 

Veal or Mutton Broth. — To each pound of meat add one 
quart of cold water, bring it gently to a boil ; skim it and add salt ; 
simmer the broth about three hours. A little rice may be boiled 
with the meat. When cold skim off all the fat. 

Chicken Broth. — Take part of a chicken, joint it and cover 
with water ; let it boil closely covered until the meat drops from the 
bones, then skim off the fat, strain, and season with a little salt, 
and if liked add a teaspoonful of rice, and let boil until the rice 
is cooked. 

Scraped Beef. — Take a good piece of raw steak, lay it on a 
meat board, and with a knife scrape into fine bits ; after removing 
all hard and grisly parts put it into a pan over the fire and let it 
remain just long enough to become thoroughly heated through, 
stirring it up from the bottom occasionally ; season with a little 
salt. This is very nutritious, and quite palatable. 

To Prepare an Egg. — Beat an egg until very light, add sea- 
soning to the taste, and then steam until thoroughly warmed 
through, but not hardened. This will take about two minutes. 
An egg prepared in this way will not distress a sensitive stomach.

solved; then strain and set away to get cold. 

Barley Water.— Soak one pint of barley in lukewarm water 
for a few minutes, then drain ofif the water. Put the barley in 
three quarts of cold water, and cook slowly until the barley is quite 
soft, skimming occasionally. This barley water, when cold, flavor 
with a little jelly or lemonade. 

Rice Milk.— Pick and wash the rice carefully; boil it in 
water until it swells and softens ; when the water is partly boiled 
away, add some milk. It may be boiled entirely in milk, by setting 
the vessel in which the rice is in, in boiling water ; sweeten with 
white sugar, and season with nutmeg. It also may be thickened 
with a little flour or beaten egg. 

Flaxseed Tea.— One-half pound of flaxseed, one-half pound

the syrup, and to each pint add a glass of French brandy. Two 
or three doses of a tablespoonful or less will check any slight 
diarrhoea. When the attack is violent, give a tablesnoonful after 
each discharge until the complaint is in subjection. It will arrest 
dysentery if given in season, and is a pleasant and safe remedy. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 



Amount of Refreshments Required for Entertaining 
Fifty Guests. — Five chickens and twelve heads of celery for 
salad. One hundred sandwiches. One and one-half pounds of 
coffee. Three pints of cream. Two molds of jelly and five loaves 
of cake. For scalloped oysters : One gallon of oysters, two pounds 
of crackers, and one pound of butter. Five dozen biscuits. Two 
and one-half pounds of butter. Eight pounds of ham boiled and 
two pounds of butter for one hundred mixed ham sandwiches. — 
Mrs. S. J. McElevey. 

To Clean Paint. — Tea leaves may be saved from the table 
for a few days, and when sufficient are collected, steep, not boil, 
them for half an hour in a tin pan. Strain the water off through 
a sieve, and use this tea to wash all varnished paint. It removes 
spots, and gives a fresher, newer appearance than when soap and 
water is used. For white paint, take up a small quantity of whit- 
ing on a damp piece of old white flannel, and rub over the surface 
lightly, and it will leave the paint remarkably bright and new. 

To Mend Broken Dishes. — Take one-fourth of a pound of 
white glue, break the pieces fine, put in a bottle, and add muriatic 
acid enough to cover the glue; cork the bottle tightly, and place 
where it will be warm until the contents have become liquid of thf 
consistency of thin molasses. To mend an earthen or glass dish, 
see that the edges are clean ; then warm the parts until they are so 
hot that you can scarcely hold in your hands, but do not heat so hot 
as to burn the cement. With a flat stick apply the cement to the 
edges as quick as you can, put them together, and let another 
person tie them tightly. When this is done, put the mended dishes 
on a shelf in a warm room until the cement has become thoroughly 
dry and hard. — Mrs. C. H. Gilman. 

To Raise the Pile of Velvet. — Cover a hot smoothing-iron 
with a wet cloth, hold the velvet firmly over it ; the vapor rising 
will raise the pile of velvet with the assistance of a light whisk. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 1 99 

Put one or two red peppers or a few pieces of charcoal into 
the pot where ham, cabbage, etc., is boiUng, and the house will not 
be filled with offensive odor. 

To Wash Oil-Cloths. — In washing oil-cloth, never use any 
soap or a scrub brush ; it will destroy an oil-cloth that should last 
for years, in a short time. Use instead warm water and a soft 
cloth of flannel and w^pe off with water and skim milk. 

Baking PovvoiiR. — Eight ounces of soda, eight ounces of 
flour, seven ounces of tartaric acid ; sift well together. — Miss Eliza 
Powers. 

Soft Soap. — Eighteen pounds of potash to twenty pounds of 
grease ; boil until the scraps are eaten up, then pour into a barrel 
and fill it with cold water ; stir it well every day until it thickens, 
which is generally two weeks. — Mrs. H. B. Wick. 

Soap. — Four and one-half pounds of soda ash, two pounds 
of lime, two ounces of borax ; boil in three gallons of water half 
an hour, then pour it into a tub to settle ; clean the kettle and put 
in seven pounds of clean grease while the lye is settling; then 
pour off the lye into the kettle and boil two or three hours ; put 
five gallons of water into the tub to settle, and then throw in 
occasionally from that, as it rises, to keep from boiling over. — 
Mrs. A. B. Maximll, Leetonia O. 

To Clean Straw Matting. — If white straw matting is 
washed twice during the summer in salt and water — a pint of salt 
to half a pailful of warm soft water — and dried quickly with a 
soft cloth, it will be long before it will turn yellow. A thin coat of 
varnish applied to straw matting will make it much more durable, 
and keep the matting looking; fresh and new. White varnish 
should be used on white matting. When varnished it will not 
need to be washed. Be sure and have the varnish thin, or the 
matting will crack. 

To Clean Tinware. — Tinware looks much nicer when 
washed in hot water with milk instead of soap, and will not require 
rough scouring, which soon wears oif the tin. 

To Take Mildew from Linen. — Rub the spots with soap ; 
scrape chalk over it and rub it well; lay on the grass in the 
sun ; as it dries, wet it a little ; it will come out with two apphca- 
tions, — Mrs. R. W. Tayler.

reducing with cold water. This is intended for the outside of 
buildings ; put on with a white-wash brush. For inside walls, 
take as before, one bushel of unslacked lime, three pounds of 
sugar, five pounds of salt ; prepare as above, and put on with a 
brush. 

Another Paint. — Take about a peck of unslacked lime, slack 
it in hot water; add about six pounds of lard, or any kind of 
grease ; put in about two pounds of glue and one pound of Spanish 
whiting, a few handfuls of salt. Apply it while hot. 

To Revive Withered Flowers. — Dip the stems (after cut- 
ting about one-half inch from them) into boiling water, and, by the 
time the water is cold, the flowers will revive. 

To Get Rid of Flies. — Take one-half teaspoonful of black 
pepper in powder, one teaspoonful of brown sugar, and one tea- 
spoonful of cream; mix well together, and place in a room on a 
plate where the flies are troublesome. 

To Get Free from Ants. — Sprinkle quick-lime on the win- 
dow-sills, or wherever they get in ; camphor gum wrapped in paper 
and laid around when they are thick, will also drive them away. 

To Wash Muslin Dresses in Delicate Colors. — They 
should not be washed with soap. The best fluid to wash them in 
is rice water, made by boiling one pound of rice in one gallon of 
water ; reserve a quart of the water for starching ; then wash the 
dress in the remainder ; rinse in clear or slightly blued water ; then 
starch the dress in the remaining quantity of rice water and iron 
quickly. 

To Dye Blue on Cotton (Two and one-half pounds). — 
One ounce of oxalic acid, one ounce of Prussian blue, put together 
in a bottle of soft water two or three days before using ; shake often 
so as to dissolve ; when ready to use, put in a brass kettle plenty 
of cold water and the solution ; when it comes to a boil, put in your 
rags a few minutes, and rinse around. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 201 

To Dye Yellow (One and one-half pounds). — Six ounces 
of sugar of lead, four ounces of bichromate potash ; dissolve each 
in a pail of hot water ; dip your rags, first in the lead and then in 
the potash ; dip the yellow in hot lime-water for orange, and blue 
in yellow for green. — Mrs. R. McMillan. 

For Coloring Scarlet That Will Not Fade. — To six 
pounds of woolen goods take three ounces of cochineal, three 
ounces cream tartar, and three ounces of solution of tin ; dissolve 
the cream tartar in enough water to set the goods ; scald the goods 
in the same water half an hour ; soak the cochineal in =^ft water 
over night; when ready to color, let the cochineal scald, but not 
boil, using goods out of cream tartar water, and put in cochineal 
solution ; let them scald several hours ; goods ought then to be 
dark color ; drain out of that ; add solution of tin to same liquid, 
put in the goods and let them remain until the coloring is all 
absorbed.— Mr.y. R. McMillan. 

To Clean Marble. — Take two parts of common soda, one 
part of pumice stone, and one part of finely powdered chalk ; sift it 
through a fine sieve, and mix it with watery then rub it well all 
over the marble, and the stains will be removed; rub the marble 
over with salt and water. 

To Clean Tinware. — The best thing for cleaning tinware is 
common soda ; dampen a cloth, dip it in soda, rub the ware briskly, 
after which wipe dry. 

To Wash Hair Brushes. — Dissolve a piece of soda in warm, 
not hot, water; dip the bristles only of the brush once in, then 
rub a little soap on them, and continue dipping the brush in and out 
(taking care that the water does not get to the back of the handle) 
till it becomes white and clean; then dip into cold water in the 
same manner ; shak and wipe with a cloth, and lay before the fire, 
bristles down, to dry. 

To Clean Cut Glass. — Having washed cut glass articles, 
let them dry, and afterwards rub them with prepared chalk and a 
soft brush, carefully going into all the cavities. 

Indelible Ink. — To one tablespoon of rain water, one-half 
teaspoon of vinegar, add a piece of lunar caustic three inches long ; 
shake well together ; put on to your cloth a little milk and soda 



202 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

(to a tablespoon of milk, a piece of baking soda as large as a 
grain of corn) ; iron smooth and write immediately. — Mrs. C. D. 
Arms. 

Iron Rust. — This may be removed by salt mixed with a 
little lemon juice; put in the sun; if necessary use two appli- 
cations. 

Mildew. — Dip the stained cloth in buttermilk, and lay in 
the sun. 

Bleaching Process. — Ten cents worth of chloride of lime, 
dissolved in enough water to cover well ; when dissolved, pour 
into a large tubful of water; saturate the cloth well with water 
before putting into the lime-water ; rinse around well with a stick 
until the cloth gets white all over; let it stand one-half hour; 
then wash out in clean water and boil. — Mrs. Win. Bonnell. 

To Clean Kid Gloves. — Pour naphtha in a bowl, enough to 
wash one glove ; dip in the glove, and rub every part as hard as 
you would in washing a rag ; draw on the hand immediately, and 
rub until dry with a clean towel ; proceed in the same manner 
with the other glove, using clean naphtha. 

To Clean Brittania Ware. — It should first be rubbed with 
a woolen cloth and sweet oil, and then washed in water and suds, 
and rubbed with soft water and whiting. 

To Clean Mirrors. — Never wash a mirror with a cloth, but 
after removing all the dust from a mirror and frame with an old 
silk handkerchief or feather duster, dampen a piece of soft paper 
and rub the surface of the mirror till perfectly clear and free from 
spots, then wipe off all the moisture with a soft dry paper and 
the mirror will be as clear as glass can be, without motes or 
streaks, as is the case when it is washed and polished with a 
cloth. 

To Purify a Sink. — Sinks will, in hot weather, become 
foul ; it is almost impossible for any one to help it unless some 
chemical preparation is used. Dissolve copperas — one pound in 
four gallons of water. Pour over the sink three or four times. 

To Soften Hard Water. — An ounce of quick-lime dis- 
solved in nine quarts of water, and the clear solution put into a 
barrel of hard water; the whole will become soft when cleared. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECIPES 203 

Paste for Cleaning Brass and Other Metals. — Take 
oxalic acid one part, rotten stone six parts ; mix with equal parts 
of oil and spirits of turpentine to a paste. 

Management of Gold Fish.— One fish to one quart of 
water ; use the same kind of water, whether spring or river water ; 
change daily in summer ; every other day in winter ; use shallow 
rather than deep vessels, with small pebbles in the bottom (to 
be kept clean) ; keep in the shade and a cool part of the room ; use 
a small net rather than the hand when changing the water ; feed 
with cracker, the yolk of egg, lettuce and flies every third or 
fourth day and put a little in at a time. Do not feed at all from 
November to the end of February, and but little for the three 
following months. 

To Keep Different Things. — Pack grapes in cotton. Keep 
crumbs and pieces of bread in an earthen vessel, in a cool, dry 
place, well covered. Put fresh lard or suet in tin vessels. Salt 
pork in unglazed earthenware. Preserves or jellies in glass, 
china or stoneware. Cabbage, buried in the ground, roots up- 
ward. Salt in a dry place ; meal in a cool, dry place ; ice in the 
cellar, wrapped in flannel ; vinegar in wood or glass. 

Moths in Carpets. — Take a coarse crash towel, wring it out 
in clean water, spread it smoothly over the carpet, then iron it 
dry, repeating the operation on all suspected places and those 
least used. Then, by placing a few crumbs of sulphur under the 
edges of the carpet, the result is accomplished. 

Cement.— Two ounces of acetic acid, one ounce of best white 
glue— the acid dissolves the glue. Put in a wide-mouthed bottle, 
with a brush always ready. Good for everything. Fix like a 
mucilage bottle. It dries directly. 

Excellent Cologne.— Rose-geranium water, one quart; oil 
of rose geranium, two ounces ; oil of rose verbena, two drachms ; 
oil of bergamot, two drachms; oil of jessamine, one ounce; oil 
of lavender, Eng., one drachm ; extract of mille fleur, one ounce. 
This recipe requires five quarts of alcohol. 

Household Uses of Ammonia. — For washing paint, put a 
tablespoonful in a quart of moderately hot water, dip in a flannel 
cloth, and with this simply wash off the woodwork. No scrub- 
bing will be necessary. For taking grease from any fabric, use 



204 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

the ammonia nearly pure, then lay white blotting paper over the 
spot and iron lightly. To clean silver, mix two teaspoonfuls in a 
quart of hot soapsuds. Wash the ware with an old brush. For 
cleaning hair brushes, shake the brush up and down in a mixture 
of one teaspoonful of ammonia to one pint of hot water. Then 
rinse in cold water and stand them in the wind or a hot place to 
dry. For washing finger-marks from mirrors or windows, put a 
few drops of ammonia on a moist rag, and rub quickly. If you 
wish your house plants to flourish, put a few drops into every 
pint used in watering. A teaspoonful in a basin of cold water 
will add much to the refreshing effects of a bath. Nothing is 
better than ammonia and water for cleaning the hair. In every 
case rinse ofif the ammonia with clear water. 

Carpet Cleaning Recipe. — Two and one-half cakes of ivory 
soap, eight ounces of washing soda, four ounces of powdered 
borax. Boil in one gallon of water until dissolved ; add four 
gallons of water to this and let cool. — Mrs. W. S. Bonnell. 

To Wash Windows. — It is said that windows washed in 
water, to which a little bluing has been added, will show a fine 
brilliance and keep fresh longer than when washed in the usual 
manner. 

For Sting of Wasp or Bee. — Most efficacious and speedy in 
results is a plaster of clove oil and common salt. It seems to 
counteract the effects of the poison immediately. — Mrs. A. E. 
Kauifmann. 

The Best Thing to Take Mildew Out of Linen. — Rub 
soap well into the moistened linen. Then scrape fine some 
common chalk and rub that also into the linen. Lay on the grass. 
As it dries, moisten again and again, if necessary. The mildew 
usually disappears very rapidly with this treatment. — Mrs. A. E. 
Kauifmann. 

To Clean Tiles. — Add one tablespoonful of kerosene to 
pail of hot water for scrubbing tiles and it will both cleanse and 
show up their colors to perfection. 



ANTIDOTES FOR POISON 



The following list gives some of the more common poisons 
and the remedies most likely to be on hand in case of need : 

Acids. — These cause great heat and sensation of burning 
pain from the mouth down to the stomach. Remedies : Magnesia, 
soda, pearl ash, or soap dissolved in water; then use stomach- 
pump, or emetic. 

Alkali. — Best remedy is vinegar. 

Ammonia. — Remedy: Lemon juice or vinegar. 

Alcohol. — First cleanse out the stomach by an emetic, then 
dash cold wated on the head, and give ammonia (spirits of 
hartshorn). 

Arsenic. — Remedies : In the first place evacuate the stomach, 
then give the white of eggs, lime water, or chalk and water, char- 
coal, and the preparation of iron, particular hydrate. 

Laudanum. — Same as opium. 

Belladonna. — Give emetics, and then plenty of vinegar and 
water, or lemonade. * 

Morphine. — Same as opium. 

Charcoal. — In poisons by carbonic gas, remove the patient 
to the open air, dash cold water on the head and body, and stimu- 
late the nostrils and lungs with hartshorn, at the same time rub- 
bing the chest briskly. 

Corrosive Sublimate. — Give white of egg freshly mixed 
with water, or give wheat flour and water freely, or salt and water.

MEDICAL HINTS 



If a man faints, lay him on his back and let him alone. 

If any poison is swallowed, drink instantly half a glass of 
cool water with a heaping teaspoonful each of common salt and 
ground mustard stirred into it. This vomits as soon as it reaches 
the stomach, but for fear some of the poison might remain, swal- 
low the whites of two raw eggs, or drink a cup of strong coffee — 
these two being antidotes for a greater number of poisons than 
any dozen other articles known, besides the advantage of their 
being at hand ; if not, a pint of sweet oil, or lamp oil, or drip- 
pings, or melted butter or lard are good substitutes, especially if 
they vomit quickly. 

Cure for Hydrophobia. — Take elecampane root and boil in 
fresh milk; give it to the patient, who should fast after taking; 
give a second and third dose on alternate days. This remedy has 
been known to effect a cure even after the spasms have commenced. 

To Cure Hoarseness. — Saturate a flannel cloth with glycerine 
and spread on the chest ; in half an hour the hoarseness will be 
relieved. — Mrs. Sydney Strong. 

Cough Syrup. — One quart of water, one pint of molasses, 
and a handful of hops (tied in a cloth) ; boil them together until 
reduced one-half ; when cold, add one teaspoonful of paregoric to 
each cup of syrup ; dose, one tablespoonful. — Mrs. J. G. Butler. 

Whooping-Cough Syrup. — One ounce of boneset, one ounce 
of slippery elm, one ounce of flaxseed ; simmer together in one 
quart of water until the strength is entirely extracted ; strain care- 
fully ; add one pint of molasses, one-half pound loaf sugar ; simmer 
all together and when cold, bottle tight. One teaspoonful at a 
dose. — Mrs. G. W. Haney. 

Simple Cholera Preventive. — An eminent physician says 
the surest preventive of Asiatic cholera is sulphur. Put one-half 



208 



THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 



teaspoonful of flour of sulphur into each of your stockings ; never 
go out with an empty stomach ; eat no fresh bread or sour food. 
This is not only a preventive in an epidemic in cholera, but also in 
many other epidemic diseases. 

Good Salve for Burns. — One-fourth of a pound of tallow ; 
one-fourth of a pound of lard, one-half pound of oxide of zinc, one 
ounce of camphor gum ; mix by heating over a slow fire. — Mrs. 
M. I. Arms. 

A Cure for Warts. — Wet the brimstone end of a match, and 
rub on to the wart, repeating until the wart is removed. — Miss 
Lide Wick. 

Diphtheria. — Tar put between two layers of cloth and tied 
on the neck. 

A Good Tonic. — Ten cents worth of comfrey, elecampane, 
spikenard, Columbia root, wild cherry bark and burdock, one-half 
paper of hoarhound, five cents Avorth of rattle root, one quart of 
strained honey, or two pounds of sugar ; cover with water and 
steep ; pour off and repeat the operation until you have a gallon ; 
when cold, add one quart of whisky. Dose, one tablespoonful 
three times a day. — Mrs. H. B. Wick. 

Croup. — One teaspoonful of powdered alum, mixed with 
two teaspoonfuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of molasses. 

Cure for Burns and All Kinds of Sores. — One-half pound 
of white lead, one half pound of red lead, two ounces of camphor 
gum, one-half ounce of oil of spike, one and one-half pints of olive 
oil. Put these all together in a brass kettle ; simmer over a stove 
two hours, being very careful not to burn ; stir it constantly. — Mrs. 
M. I. Arms. 

The best thing to stop the bleeding of a moderate cut instantly 
is to cover it profusely with cobweb, or flour and salt — half and 
half. 

If the blood comes from a wound by jets or spurts, be spry, 
or the man will die in a few minutes, because an artery is severed. 
Tie a handkerchief loosely around, near the part, between the 
wound and the heart ; put a stick between the handkerchief and 



MEDICAL HINTS 209 

the skin, and twist it around until the blood ceases to flow ; keep 
it there until the doctor comes. If in a position where a handker- 
chief cannot be used, press the thumb on a spot near the wound, 
between the wound and the heart ; increase the pressure until the 
blood ceases to flow, but do not lessen the pressure for an instant 
before the physician arrives, so as to glue up the wound by 
coagulation or cooling and hardening of the blood. 

If your clothes take fire, slide the hands down the dress, 
keeping them as close to the body as possible, at the same time 
sinking to the floor by bending the knees. This has a smothering 
effect on the flames. If not extinguished, or great headway 
gotten, lie down on the floor and roll over and over; or better, 
envelope yourself in a carpet rug, bed cloth, or any garment you 
can get hold of, always preferring woolen. 

If the body is tired, rest ; if the brain is tired, sleep. The 
three best medicines in the world are warmth, abstinence and 
repose. 

Cough Syrup.— Two ounces of snake-root, two ounces of 
squills, one ounce of fennel seed, two ounces of juniper berries, 
two ounces of senna, one-half ounce of anise seed, two ounces of 
Columbia root; to the entire amount two gallons of water; boil 
down to one-fourth ; set off to cool. Strain through a cloth, and 
add one pint of whisky and one quart of molasses.— Mr.y. Allen 
Boyle, Salem, Ohio. 

Camphor Ice.— One and one-half ounces of spermaceti, one- 
half ounce of white wax, four tablespoons of olive oil, heated to- 
gether; when dissolved, add six drachms of camphor gum. 

Mustard Plasters.— Mustard plasters mixed with sweet oil 
(or better, camphorated oil), will not blister, will give quick re- 
lief in case of cold on the lungs, pleurisy, pain in the back, etc. 
White of an egg is also good to mix with mustard, but lacks the 
heating properties of the oil. 

Camphorated oil is an excellent remedy for cold-sores, chapped 
hands and lips, mumps, sore throat and chest, bruises and sore- 
ness in general. It is prepared by putting into sweet oil all the 
camphor gum it will dissolve. 



210 THE YOUNGSTOWN COOK BOOK 

Every household, especially where there are children, should 
always keep ready a bottle of linseed oil, mixed with lime water, 
to use in case of burns, scalds, etc. Apply immediately to the 
burnt part, saturating a piece of cotton thoroughly, and covering 
closely from the air. Any druggist will prepare it, or it can be 
prepared by pouring water on a small piece of lime and, after it 
is slacked, stirring the water into the oil until it is rather thick.
