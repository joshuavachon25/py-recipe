with flour, starch or ground cocoa shells or coloring matter — nothing but the nutri-

Wedding Cake 

By Julia Davis Chandler 

''T'HIS day, my Julia, thou must make 
X For Mistress Bride the wedding cake. 
Knead but the dough, and it will be 
To paste of almonds turned by thee, 
Or kiss it, thou, but once or twice 
And for the bride cake there'll be spice." 



SO wrote Robert Herrick, in Mer- 
rie England, long ago. Were such 
charmers numerous nowadays, 
caterers and bakers would like to em- 
ploy them ; they could cast such spells 
of love-blindness on many customers. 
Perhaps Herrick's brunette, Julia, was 
to compound a light cake with almonds 
only, a real bride cake, but the wedding 
cake we distribute to dream on is the 
richest of fruit cakes. 

The following recipes are from the 
two sections of our country, where 
cookery has been an art handed down 
from ancestors, who brought with them 
the best of the Old World to the New. 

Pennsylvania Fruit Cake (Mrs. L., 

Philadelphia) 

Twelve eggs. One pound of sugar. 
One pound of butter. One and one- 
half pounds of currants. One and one- 
half pounds of raisins. Three-quarters 
of a pound of citron. One pound of 
flour. One nutmeg. One teaspoonful 
of mace. The juice and rind of one 
orange, and the same of lemon. One- 



quarter of a pound of candied or pre- 
served cherries. One-half a pound of 
chopped figs. One-half a gill of brandy. 
One cup of strong coffee. 

Countess , who, also, uses this 

recipe, prefers, instead of cherries, a 
jar of strawberry preserve, and be- 
sides the other fruits adds dates, well 
chopped, and evaporated peaches, fine 
shaved, also plenty of almonds and 
other nuts. 

Creole Fruit Cake (New Orleans) 

One pound of flour. One pound of 
brown sugar. One pound of butter, or 
three-quarters, if preferred. One pound 
of eggs, — one dozen. Two pounds of 
raisins, seeded and cut in two. Two 
pounds of cleaned currants. One pound 
of citron, cut small, but not too fine. 
One-fourth a pound of candied orange 
peel. One-fourth a pound of lemon peel. 
One-half a pound of blanched almonds. 
One-half a pound of pecans, chopped 
small. One heaped tablespoonful of 
powdered nutmeg. One heaped table- 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



spoonful of powdered allspice and two 
heaped tables poonfu Is of powdered cin- 
namon. One cup of strong black coffee 

Rub the sugar and butter together 
to a cream. Add the spice and coffee. 
Beat the eggs very light. Flour the 
fruit with one-half the flour. Add the 
rest of the flour, the fruit, and the 
frothed eggs, alternately. 

Line two cake-pans of five pounds' 
capacity, each, with two layers of new, 
grocery, brown paper, well greased. 
Set pans in an oven, which is barely 
warm, for ten minutes, then increase 
heat very little, and keep your oven 
at a moderate heat for about four hours. 
Cover the pans with double brown 
paper, greased to prevent burning the 
top. When the cake leaves the sides 



'editing Cake of Prince and Prill 
Aiiol phns of Teek 



of the pans, it is baked. When cold, 
turn out of the pans. 

Take one glass of whiskey or brandy, 
and one glass of sherry or port, and 
sweeten them a little. Place the cake 
on a dish, and baste with this and re- 
baste with the drippings until the liquid 
is all used. Cover with paraffine paper, 
and then with brown paper. 

If you wish a black cake, brown the 
flour before using. Instead of coffee 
you can make a caramel. Put one 
cup of sugar in a skillet, and, when it 
begins to turn a dark color, add to it 
one pint of water, stir a little while, 
then bottle for use. 

A Southern lady has made hun- 
dreds of pounds of this cake to fill pri- 
vate orders. One English firm has long 
made the wedding cake for all the 
weddings in the royal family. This 
famous firm, patronized by Queen Vic- 
toria and the English nobility, owes 
its success to the fact that a box of 
cakes, given by its founder, Richard 
Bolland, to the Queen, when she was 
a young princess, in 1835, so pleased 
her that later the Bollands were made 
'"by royal warrant purveyors to Her 
Majesty Queen Victoria and His Royal 
Highness the Prince of Wales." 

At the wedding of King Edward's 
daughter, Princess Maud of Wales, 
twelve cakes were sent to notable rela- 
tives who could not be present. And 
here is the recipe, with its very novel 
almond icing, said to be that which 
was used for the 

Royal Wedding Cake 
One pound and a half of butter. 
One pound and a half of flour. One 
pound of sugar. One pound of dried 
cherries, slightly chopped. One pound 
and a half of currants. One pound 
and a half of candied orange, lemon, 
and citron peel in equal quantities, all 
of these to be shredded very fine. 
Eight ounces of pounded almonds. 
Twelve whole eggs. The rinds of four 



Wedding Cake 



oranges, rubbed on sugar. Half an 
ounce of ground spices, consisting of 
cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, mixed 
in equal proportions. A teaspoon ful 
of salt. Half a pint of old brown 
brandy. 

All these delicious things are to be 
combined in the following manner. In 
a large earthen cake or mixing-bowl 
place the butter, and cream it with a 
wooden spoon. Next add, gradually, 
the sugar, flour, and eggs, continuing 
to blend them with the butter steadily. 
When these have been thoroughly 
mixed, the cherries, currants, candied 
peel, ground almonds, brandy, salt, 
and spices must be added gradually; 
and, when all of them have been very 
thoroughly incorporated with the bat- 
ter, the whole mass is to be poured 
into a pan that has been previously 
lined with buttered paper. After the 
long, slow, and steady baking that all 
such cake requires, it must be iced, 
when wanted. At the Hollands ' the 
cakes are kept at least six months to 
season; and thousands of pounds are 
kept on hand ready for shipment, on 
sudden orders from any colony or 
country around the globe, — Australia, 
India, or America. A Boston woman 
caterer has cakes on hand during the 
summer for quick use, but does not 
frost them until wanted, as, she says, 
the frosting darkens from contact with 
the cake. 

Royal Icing 
The above cake is to be iced, first, 
with an almond icing. Mix eight 
ounces of very fine-powdered almonds 
with double that quantity of sifted 
sugar, a little orange-flower water, and 
sufficient whites of eggs to form the 
whole into a soft paste. Spread a 
coating of this all over the surface of 
the cake, and, when it has become cold 
and hard, a second and different icing 
is to be put on over this one. To make 
it, take eight whites of new-laid eggs

in a large-sized basin, and add a pound 
and a half of sifted sugar and work to- 
gether with a wooden spoon, adding 
now and then a little strained lemon 
juice, until the whole compound has 
a thick shiny substance. This icing 
must cover the first one at least a 
quarter of an inch deep and be dried 
in a warm atmosphere. 

Besides the twelve cakes made by 

this recipe for the absent royalties, 

there was the grand one for the wedding

The Birds' School-house 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



WHEN we found the place, 
we wished with all our hearts 
that we could go to school 
there ourselves, learning only the lessons 
which Nature could teach. The house 
was built in the long ago, and in the 
long ago some one had made it well. 
But those who built it were gone now; 
and most of the children who went 
to school there were gone, too. Only 
one was living close by, and his chil- 
dren attended school in the big new 
building on the hill. 

They told us that we could occupy 
the house, if we wished; and we con- 
cluded to live there awhile instead of 
camping in the woods, as we had planned. 
We did not mind a few leaks in the 
roof. We could stretch a canvas over 
our heads or sleep under an umbrella, 
if need be. For time had lent irre- 
sistible attractions to the place, and 
a few hours of labor would convert 



it into a bower. To us, at least, it 
would be better than a palace. We 
could spare a few of the vines which 
covered our doorway and a few weeds, 
not all of them. 

How surprised the birds were to 
have any one move in! Indeed, none 
of them seemed quite glad. There 
is always a dread about new neigh- 
bors. Who can tell how troublesome 
they will be? And, surely, people who 
would occupy such a wretched old 
house must be queer. So they thought, 
no doubt ; and several of them expressed 
their determination to have nothing 
to do with us, while a pair of kingbirds 
threatened us with downright vio- 
lence, if we did not leave. 

Two wrens that were building over 
the door scolded sharply, and in high- 
pitched voices warned us they would 
move at once if we continued to sweep 
dirt in their vicinity. Some of the 



The Birds' School-house 



other residents would probably have 
followed the suggestion of the wrens, 
but that housekeeping was already 
begun and moving was inconvenient. 
The wrens themselves decided to make 
the best of it, and stay where they 
were; and before the summer was over 
they did much to atone for their early 
suspicions of us. 

Meantime we were conducting our- 
selves in the quietest and most re- 
spectful manner, indulging our curi- 
osity only at long range through an 
opera glass. Far be it from us to be 
caught meddling with our neighbors' 
domestic affairs on so short an ac- 
quaintance! We even attempted to 
propitiate for our presence by scat- 
tering crumbs and seeds in their paths 
and by leaving on our housetop a 
goodly supply of building material, — 
moss, hair, rags, thread, ribbons, straws, 
and grasses. 

It was against the rules of the fam- 
ily to speak in a loud tone indoors or 
out; and it was agreed that, when one 
individual wished to summon another, 
it was to be done by whistling the 
call-notes of the wood-thrush, "Come 
to me." 

The month of May was not ended 
when the first visit was made to the 
old house; and so much bird-song was 
heard that our expectation was on 
tiptoe every moment, and housekeep- 
ing affairs were never really settled 
in consequence of our having to spend 
so much time outside. This troubled 
us little, however, as we had long had 
a theory — not held in great esteem by 
our orthodox, common-sense friends — 
that a person should never stay indoors 
when he could as well be out; and we 
could as well be out most of the time, 
if we chose to abide the consequences, 
and do our little housework after the 
birds retired for the night. 

Yet we, too, must go to bed early; 
for it was often necessary to get up 
at dawn, the noises about the house 



indicating most clearly that we were 
missing something. We stubbornly re- 
fused to answer the summons of the 
crows at 3 a.m., and we were inclined 
to think all the birds rose too early; 
but we soon became aware that we 
could ill afford to miss the morning 
glow, the changing of the eastern sky 
from gray to gold, the lighting of the 
hills and tree-tops and the awakening 
of the birds. 

"Full many a glorious morning have I seen 
Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign 
eye, 
Kissing with golden face the meadows green, 
Gilding pale streams with heavenly al- 
chemy." 

It was early the second day when 
we heard a Kentucky cardinal, and 
went out to find him perched upon our 
wire fence. How he could have es- 
caped us during that first happy day 
we could not imagine. Now we trem- 
bled for his safety! How dared he 
sit in so conspicuous a place? We 
sincerely hoped no foe was present 
to "adjust an arrow' 1 for him. He 
was in company with no one, and we 
were doubtful for a while if he had a 
mate; but so blithe he seemed and so 
long he tarried that our suspicions 
were aroused, though we hardly dared 
yet peer about too boldly. 

A few days later, as we were passing 
near the hedgerow, which grew across 
the path from our great chimney, 
there was a sudden movement in the 
hedge, and a bird flew out the farther 
side. To our surprise we found a 
loose nest quite exposed to view and 
containing a grayish egg, marked with 
brown. To our further surprise this 
proved to be the home of the cardinal. 
If all bird studies were as easy as this ! 
The beautiful lord of the manor dared 
not visit his home too often, and the 
more modestly attired lady slipped 
quietly out on the side opposite our 
house; but they were very happy, and 



IO 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



their sharply whistled "whee-whee- 
wheel" made us happy, also. 

In just three weeks from that day 
the wife's patient and exhaustive brood- 
ing was over, and the nest held three 
baby cardinals. They were not beau- 
tiful, but dear, no doubt, and bearing 
that relation to their brilliant father 
which rendered them doubly dear and 
their place in the world doubly dan- 
gerous. Each day for five we sat 
quietly in our chimney corner, watch- 
ing the feeding of those babies. On 
the fifth day we were absent about four 
hours in a neighboring woods. When 
we returned, the parent cardinals sat 
side by side on the hedgerow, mourn- 
ing. Their home had been robbed. 
Not one baby, but all three were gone. 
Doubtless, they had had a parox- 
ysm of grief, and had flown hither and 
thither in anxiety. Perhaps they had 
even struggled with the enemy, but 
all we heard of their sorrowing was a 
low murmur. 

It was useless to suspect a man — 
not a small boy, but a man — who had 
been working across the road and who 
afterward sold a cardinal in the village. 
It was futile to wonder if the wrong 
had been done by a troublesome crow 
who had previously disturbed their 
peace. We should have been at home, 
we felt, and guarded our own. The 
parent birds stayed with us but two 
days after the tragedy, and then went 
we knew not where. We had occa- 
sional visits during the summer from 
a female cardinal, but not a sight of 
another male. Had he, too, met the 
fate of the beautiful ? 

One bright June morning, "when 
all the world was on its feet" at the 
rising of the sun, we slipped out to 
watch a pair of goldfinches who, after 
a long courtship, had begun building 
a dwelling in our small elm-tree. A 
flicker, or golden-winged woodpecker 
that was feeding in the path, took 
flight as we stepped across the thresh- 



old; and we went forward to see what 
he had been eating. To our aston- 
ishment we found an ant-hill with two 
long lines of ants reaching not only 
to our doorway, but beyond through 
the whole house, its entire width, to 
a little cupboard where we had put 
away some honey. This honey those 
small workers were carrying off par- 
ticle by particle, moving in perfect 
file to and from the cupboard, and 
probably felicitating themselves that 
they would soon have the whole job 
complete. How much of that honey 
the woodpecker had swallowed with 
his feast of ants we could not say, 
though probably not much, as the 
line of march was uninterrupted. 

The goldfinches did not mind hav- 
ing us diverted, but our attention was 
only deferred. It took them three days 
to construct their home. They were 
not in haste, but took plenty of time 
for frolic and food. When the nest 
was done, it was as precise as possi- 
ble; and the three babies who first 
saw the light in that home must have 
been extremely comfortable. The 
elder goldfinches were not only atten- 
tive parents, but delightful neigh- 
bors. 

We enjoyed, also, in our rustic abode 
the closest fellowship with chimney 
swifts and with a pair of humming- 
birds that nested in our vines. The 
humming-birds were sufficiently famil- 
iar to come inside the window to sip 
from the honeysuckles which we placed 
there for them. At one time, when 
a drenching rain kept us indoors for 
two successive days, it was our pas- 
time to fill the honeysuckle cups with 
sweetened water, and watch the birds 
drink. So far as we could see, they 
relished it as much as the genuine 
sweet of the flowers. 

In midsummer some robins came 
and nested in the woodbine. It was 
probably a second, brood for that sea- 
son. The same vines had also a chip- 



The Birds' School-house 



ii 



ping-sparrows' nest, quite different 
from the robins' in architecture, being 
small and very neat. The sparrows 
were charming neighbors, accepting 
our offered food with hardly more shy- 
ness than a domestic hen. 

Another neighbor, one whose "preach- 
ing" never ceased during the heat of 
summer, was the red-eyed vireo. There 
was nothing particularly winsome about 
these birds, though we did not find 
them objectionable, as some persons 
do. They appeared to. us neither 
peevish nor suspicious, and we knew 
them well. Their exquisite pendant 
nest was just beside our roof. It 
measured one and a half inches, was 
fastened with twine to a forked branch, 
and ornamented on the outside with 
birch-bark peelings, which gave it a 
beautiful silvery whiteness. It hung 
under a parasol of green leaves, and 
was thus protected from the eyes of 
crows and hawks. These vireos are 
plain olive, with no conspicuous mark 
save a white arched line over the eye. 
Their eyes are bright red, but this sign 
of the family is not distinguishable with- 
out close observation and good light. 
Our vireo family consisted of one 
spoiled child, — spoiled necessarily, be- 
cause he got every bite of food brought 
to the nest, and had only to ask at- 
tention to receive it. He was slower 
than other birds in learning to fly, 
and we thought it was because of his 
oneness. He had no rival ; and life was 
quite complete without his exertions, 
so long as he had a maternal and pa- 
ternal valet. 

Down by our little ravine, overhung 
by a willow and carefully hidden in 
a tangle of bushes, we found one day 
the nest of a Maryland yellow-throat. 
The nest was not only on the ground, 
but sunken into it, and in so damp 
a spot that, when we attempted to 
investigate, our rubbers stuck in the 



mire at every step, and we had almost 
to crawl through the brambles. The 
owners of this home, with its peculiar 
site, were wee birds, the male having 
a black mask out of which his eyes 
stared inquisitively, sometimes ap- 
pealingly. We wrote many pages 
about them in our note-book; and 
often, as we prepared our simple meals, 
we entertained ourselves by repeating 
Van Dyke's verses : — 

"While May bedecks the naked trees 
With tassels and embroideries, 
And many blue-eyed violets beam 
Along the edges of the stream, 
I hear a voice that seems to say, 
Now near at hand, now far away, 
'Witchery, witchery, witchery/ 



if 



An incantation so serene, 
So innocent, befits the scene: 
There's magic in that small bird's note, 
See, there he flits, the yellow-throat: 
A living sunbeam tipped with wings, 
A spark of life that shines and sings, 
'Witchery, witchery, witchery.' M 



Sometimes we sang the lines to a tune 
all our own. This singing of one's 
own tune is another privilege of living 
in the country. 

Every day we had bird visitors in 
our retreat. In all we had a glimpse 
of sixty-three identified species, only 
twenty-two of which were every-day 
friends. But the birds were by no 
means all we had. The flowers with 
their beauty and perfume, the trees, 
the clouds, the unfettered breeze, the 
morning with a hundred voices of 
exultant praise and love, the still even- 
ing with its stars of loveliness, free- 
dom, health, happiness, — all these ful- 
filled for us the prophet's words: "Ye 
shall go out with joy, and be led forth 
with peace; the mountains and hill- 
sides shall break forth before you into 
song, and all the trees of the field shall 
clap their^hands." 



The House Party Man 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



THE House Party Man is not 
a new factor in American life. 
He has existed among us from 
the plantation days of the South and 
the rollicking, aristocratic life of Old 
Virginia, though in far less obtrusive 
fashion than now. But he has crept 
North, and is in increasing demand 
by all who entertain, whether with a 
"set of servants' ' or on the two-maid 
plan. He is the natural correlative 
of the Society Woman, — the prod- 
uct of a wealthy, leisurely class, his 
chief ambition being that of social 
success, though eventually he may 
give as political a complexion to Amer- 
ican house parties as obtains in Eng- 
land. 

Forty years ago people were too 
modest to talk about their house par- 
ties: they called such gatherings "hav- 
ing friends." Imagine Prescott at Pep- 
perell or Longfellow at Cambridge 
speaking of their friends as a house 
party ! In those days each guest shared 
in the family life. He might stroll 
over the estate with his host and use 
his horses; but he came down to break- 
fast, made obeisance to his hostess, 
played with the children, and, if left 
to his own devices, contrived to have 
a girl share them with him. He went 
to picnics, to church on Sundays, and 
generally to town on week-days. He 
was sympathetic with others, and had 
a purpose in life apart from being a 
visitor. 

To-day the House Party Man is his 
own excuse for being. He lives as an 
habitu6 of other people's domains. 
In the winter he goes South, as guest 
in superb residences built by North- 
ern men. He runs over to Europe 
for a cure in the spring, and returns 
for his summer at Newport and else- 



where. By way of occasional self- 
justification he cultivates some philan- 
thropic fad, calling upon society to 
patronize it. 

In becoming one of a house party, 
a man's obligations to his hostess are 
very different from those of a friendly 
visitor. He is now absolved from per- 
sonal considerations of gratitude to her, 
since he has conferred a favor upon 
her by his presence. He is a whole 
social function in himself, which in 
turn enables her to reign blithely over 
her guests. No wonder that the House 
Party Man is girded with a stalwart 
sense of his own importance. 

On his arrival he will find a servant 
ready to unpack his bag or trunk and 
to lay out his evening suit, or in hum- 
bler homes he may render such service 
unto himself. But in either case he 
must carry plenty of clothes, — the 
indispensable dress suit, the tennis 
or golf suit, trousers of white linen and 
of flannel, silk socks to match in color 
each one of his myriad ties, scarf pins 
galore, and Japanese silk shirts, which 
are the despair of the laundress, for 
they must neither be starched nor 
ironed damp and yet must be smooth. 
Though free from a picayune fastidi- 
ousness and from any tendency to 
glaring colors, he always dresses well; 
and his toilet articles are apt to be of 
ebony or ivory rather than of silver. 

The way in which he leaves his room 
reveals his personal traits. If he has 
been brought up by a good, house- 
keeping mother, he puts it in a sem- 
blance of order. If, on the other hand, 
he has been waited on by affectionate 
sisters, the chambermaid folds his 
trousers, hangs up his coat, and ar- 
ranges the top of his bureau, garters, 
suspenders, cigarette stubs, sleeping

powders, and petty cash lying there 
in disorderly fashion. 

If he comes downstairs to breakfast 
as one of the family, he is apt to be 
late, and enters the room with a kind 
of laissez-faire, distingu/, aristocratic, 
pessimistic manner that is alike ag- 
gravating and condescending, as much 
as to say, At the last house where I 
stayed my breakfast was always sent 
up to me. His circumferential bow 
to the family takes the place of shak- 
ing hands with each one,, save that he 
thus greets his hostess. He may or 
may not light his cigarette on leaving 
the table, according to his whim. 

When staying in a large establish- 
ment, breakfast is served to him in 
his room, — coffee, dry toast, eggs, 
or strips of bacon, — thus securing the 
late morning nap for himself and per- 
sonal independence for his hostess, 
who yet bears him on her mind. If 
he is one of a large party, he has but 
to order what he will do. Herein is 
the subtle distinction between a house 
party and just having friends. In the 
latter case one is told what to do. 
Usually, he finds a pile of notes await- 
ing him, and accepts or declines their 
invitations without much regard to 
his hostess, unless she has succeeded 
in limiting him in regard to his liberty. 
His evenings are given to bridge whist, 
though he does not ask his hostess 
to reimburse him for his losses. 

He finds it safer to cultivate inti- 
macy with her than with her grown-up 
daughter, and would not permit him- 
self the awkwardness of being accepted 
or rejected by any one while in the 
same house with her. Such an oc- 
currence is always unlikely, as it would 
involve too much concentration, and 
the two things which he sedulously 
avoids are emotions and points of view. 
If he had the latter, he might be argu- 
mentative or assertive, when it is less 
exhausting to be complaisant and 
agreeable. 



If crafty, he will provide himself 
with chocolate bonbons for the la- 
dies or with toys for the children of 
his hostess, if there are any. He 
travels with books, and uses them 
judiciously at piazza stances or on 
woodland rambles d deux. He will 
never forget to fee those who have 
waited on him personally, unless it is 
a rule of the house "not to do so; for 
some ladies prefer' to give their ser- 
vants from one-half to one-third more 
in wages in summer than in winter, 
according to the kind and number of 
their guests. 

The growing sense of the existence 
of his necessity to social life inclines 
him to rudeness. He is rude to the 
old people, cavalier to the middle- 
aged, wants his own way with the 
young, and lays down the law in con- 
versation with them. The average 
visitor generally is neither polite nor 
careful. He scratches matches to light 
his cigar at the place handiest to him, 
drops its ashes anywhere, and throws 
its stub on the lawn. If staying in a 
palatial home, the servants watch 
round until he has gone to his room 
for the night ; but, if he is just a fam- 
ily friend in a modest home, it is a 
vexed question whether he or his guest 
shall first retire. 

His rudeness appears also in his 
later behavior. Though he may have 
ridden his host's steed lame and taxed 
his hostess's forbearance, he will call 
but once when they are in town. He 
seems to forget that he was entertained 
by them in the prospect that he is 
going to be again by somebody else. 
He may send the usual 4< bread-and- 
butter' ' note instantly upon his de- 
parture ; but, if he sees the plain daugh- 
ter of his whilom hostess at a winter 
ball, he may not have time to speak 
to her. Of course there are exceptions 
to the atmosphere of selfishness and 
rudeness in a house party. There are 
men who recognize that as guests 



14 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



they have rights as well as duties, 
and who are as delightful, courteous, 
and helpful as in the old days of 
visiting. The present wave of rude- 
ness — a passing one, presumably — 
may be due to the influx of English 
society novels, which give an im- 
pression of arbitrariness and thought- 
lessness. 

House parties must be modified be- 
fore they can stand as the best ex- 
ponents of a whole-hearted hospital- 
ity. The etiquette which now invests 
them is largely wise as self-pro- 



tection to both entertainer and guests. 
But above that etiquette should hover 
a mental atmosphere of sympathy and 
appreciation that should make ex- 
travagance and gossip the exception 
rather than the rule in society life. 
A visit is such constant shifting of 
mutual adjustments, a house party 
is such a miniature world with its op- 
portunities for good and evil, that, 
while wealth makes them possible, 
character should make them occasions 
of simple delights and of genuine growth 
in the best impulses of life. 



Mother's Vacation 

By E. D. H. . 



WE say everybody ought to 
have a vacation. No one 
tries to excuse this neces- 
sity. Almost every one has at some 
time experienced its benefits. It is 
not uncommon to hear that some radi- 
cal change of surroundings and occu- 
pation has brought back strength 
supposed to be lost forever or even 
cured what seemed a mortal disease. 
But those who need this change the 
most are the very ones who are un- 
able to expect such a thing, much less 
enjoy it. 

The more responsible the occupa- 
tion, the more constant is the personal 
attention and the more sure the con- 
sequent physical exhaustion and men- 
tal strain. Love for one's occupation 
lightens work, but it very frequently 
defers the necessary rest. It should 
be made imperative that those people 
who have the greatest responsibili- 
ties should include a vacation in their 
plans for each year. 

It is unnecessary to prove that a 
mother holds the most responsible 
of all positions, and we must add to 



this responsibility the sewing, cooking, 
and cleaning that fall to the lot of the 
average mother. But who ever heard 
of a mother having a vacation? A 
real vacation, not a trip with the chil- 
dren, but a complete separation from 
home ties and associations? That this 
idea sounds like heresy may be suffi- 
cient proof of the necessity for such 
a change. 

But such a custom will never origi- 
nate among the mothers themselves. 
Motherhood means unselfishness. If 
any mother ever longs for a change, she 
will conceal the longing, and consider 
it the morbid result of some nervous 
condition. Most men love their wives 
with a tender and protecting love, but 
they are obtuse as to the definite causes 
of irritability and loss of attractive- 
ness. Teach boys a practical knowl- 
edge of household duties and family 
requirements, that they may know 
their proper performance occupies seven 
days in the week, including holidays 
and many nights I The mother's va- 
cation must be planned for and in- 
sisted upon by the father, since he is 



Little Sand Lady 



H 



her natural protector, and in most 
cases he holds the purse-strings. 

But the question is, Who will take 
care of the family? When dread ill- 
ness comes, we summon the trained 
nurse. At such a time the condition 
of the patient is much more critical 
than that of a family rendered mother- 
less for a week or two. But why not 
educate mothers' substitutes, and cre- 
ate a new occupation for women? 
All over the country may be found 
widows and unmarried sisters who are 
left alone to earn a livelihood. They 
have no practical knowledge of any- 
thing but housework, and are too old 
to enter upon any new occupation. 
They must become either servants 
or dependants. Many such, women 
are well educated and fitted to become 
a member of any good home. It is 
plain that such an occupation as the 
proposed would require remarkable 
women, women able to do and oversee 
all kinds of housework, to entertain 
and care for children, to meet each 
emergency with promptness and tact, 
to laugh at little worries, and over- 
come all friction with ready adapta- 
bility. This capability is the result 
observed in the maturity of all intel- 
ligent domestic women. 

Much is said in these days about 
the "ounce of prevention." The 



trained nurse aids the physician in the 
cure of disorders. Why may not the 
mother's substitute join the modern 
doctor in his aim to prevent illness? 
If the demand were sufficient and the 
recompense high enough, means would 
be provided to facilitate the bringing 
of the work and the workers together. 

The mother will gain real rest and 
strength just in proportion as her 
vacation be in contrast to her ordi- 
nary surroundings and occupation. If 
she live in the country, the most good 
will be gained by a trip to some city, 
to enjoy its churches, libraries, art 
galleries, theatres, and excitement. 
If she live in the city, let her go where 
the view of ocean, mountain, or coun- 
try, seems boundless and suggestive of 
peace. When she returns to her home, 
she will be astonished to discover how 
beautiful and good her children are, 
how loving her husband, and how 
happy her lot has become. And father 
in his natural obtuseness will wonder 
how a week 01 two could bring back 
so much of girlish charm. 

If this seemingly impossible custom 
were established, the pathetic biog- 
raphy, written by a well-known author, 
would not be true of many a wife and 
mother: "My mother dropped dead 
in her lifelong journey between the 
stove and the dining table." 



Little Sand Lady 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 



Little Sand Lady in gray, in gray, 
Come from the Sleep-Sand far away ; 
Come to my Dearie at close of day, 
Little Sand Lady, come! 



Little Sand Lady from Sleep-bye-land, 
Come, and bring in your small white hand 
Gray cup filled with the soft gray sand. 
Little Sand Lady, come! 



Little Sand Lady, so still and wise, 
Come to the place where my lambkin lies, 
Sift your gray sand in her sleepy eyes. 
Little Sand Lady, come! 



An Hour in " La Verite" 

By Helen Campbell 



THIS is the way it began: — 
"You think you are having 
high old times, growling about 
London; and I admit that you know 
more about its secret corners than most 
of its inhabitants do or ever will. But 
wait till you get over here, and are 
introduced to 'La VeriteV None of 
your 'Aerated Bread-rooms,' with 
weak cocoa and bare supposition of 
coffee on tap, and that tea, like essence 
of tannin, that the Englishwomen 
swallow at all hours; for I've seen 'em! 
Wait till you find what a franc will 
do ! Wait till you see what two francs 
will do, and then tell me again, if you 
dare, that I must on no account live 
in le Quartier Latin. Hasten then, 
my old dear, if you do not want to 
have me teetotally distracted from all 
my studies by sheer longing to be just 
there and nowhere else." 

For a month these and other like 
messages had come in swift succes- 
sion, each one with some new form 
of wheedling. I was myself responsi- 
ble, in one way, for the state of mind 
brought about by the promise I had 
exacted before the young fellow left 
for his opening term at the Beaux- 
Arts. Long knowledge of the sad 
side of life in that famous Latin Quar- 
ter had made me determined to see 
for myself where it could be found at 
its best; and the young student was, 
in the mean time, with a friend, whose 
charming little apparlement, just be- 
yond the Arc de Triomphe, was in 
a hotel distinctly French, the American 
quarter some distance away. Many 
a traveler gravitates at once to this 
quarter, — "more like home," they feel, 
than unfamiliar Paris, — and thus loses 
the very thing for which the journey 
has been made, — an utterly new en- 



vironment under its own native con- 
ditions. In the American quarter they 
hear chiefly English, and live as far as 
possible on the same general plan as 
when on their native shores. 

To this apparlement, a day or two 
after my arrival, came a newly launched 
American from an inland city, — a 
stout and comfortable matron, a leader 
in society in her own home, and at 
present encased in the very charming 
results of her visits to the Magasin 
de Louvre and the Bon Marche\ Palms 
surrounded the fountain and its broad 
basin, where in the morning Monsieur 
George, the concierge, and Marie, his 
wife, washed the vegetables or even 
a stray napkin or two, while Monsieur 
Didoreau, the old artist, his easel set 
for the right point of view, made an- 
other of his always very charming 
studies of still life, bought with avid- 
ity by tenants as they came and went. 
The Spanish tenant's two monkeys, on 
the third floor, hung by their tails from 
the window, chattering their views to 
the parrots just below; while Marie, the 
tall blond Bre" tonne, with arms akimbo 
considered the work of Monsieur Di- 
doreau, offering suggestions to which 
he hearkened amiably. A basket of 
fruit, a child or two, and a bicycle 
complicated the visitor's progress; and, 
as she finally reached her destination, 
she said with a gasp : — 

"Don't you find it frightfully for- 
eign? No elevator, either." 

It was foreign, and, happily, it 
remains so; and one could easily give 
all the allotted space in this number 
to tales of the life about the foun- 
tain atid in the little rooms beyond, 
where Marie or M. George, as the 
case might be, prepared plats so deli- 
cious that the tenants nearly came

to blows as to who should secure the 
most. 

The first day of the search for just 
the right sort of rooms in the Luxem- 
bourg quarter proved a failure; but we 
marked it with a red star, nevertheless. 
Bert, with a mysterious look on his 
face, led me through a network of little 
streets and passages, till in the narrow- 
est and darkest of them all we reached 
an old house with no exterior sign as 
to its purpose. But it was clean, with 
none of the mustiness of age we had 
encountered at some other points; 
and no scent of vanished dinners was 
in the air, only, as the door above 
opened, there floated down to us the 
aroma of coffee so delicious that we 
quickened our steps. 

"I told you so," Bert said. "Oh, 
my buttons !" And at this point we 
were there, the front of the house 
forming a single dining-room too small 
for more than the one long table, at 
the head of which a smiling, blue- 
eyed woman was at this moment stand- 
ing, her hands holding a steaming 
tureen, which a tall, heavily bearded, 
fiercely mustached man, evidently a 
Russian, took from her, and proceeded 
to serve. 

In another moment our turn had 
come; and we tasted a soup so simply 
perfect in flavor, consistence, all that 
makes soup a joy, that we ate in silent 
gratitude, only the effort toward the 
end, to determine just what made its 
charm, vitiating a trifle my own con- 
tentment. 

"Un franc ou deux?" the host had 
said low, as Bert took his place; and, 
as he turned to me, I answered unhesi- 
tatingly, "Un seul." It was worth 
going away unsatisfied, it might be, 
to test what lay within the capacity 
of a franc. 

"Half a franc does it, if you choose; 
but I suppose he didn't want to insult 
me when I had a guest," Bert laughed, 
nodding to another comer, who said, 



quite unabashed, "Un demi-franc 
aujourd'hui, . monsieur." Monsieur 
looked at him commiseratingly, — the 
tall and rather haggard man, whose 
plate he filled to the brim with the 
rich soup, which the new arrival ate 
deliberately with slow enjoyment. 
We, in turn, had received a little square 
of perfectly browned fish with a pecul- 
iar but delightful sauce, acid predomi- 
nating, and then an equally small 
portion, a delicious ragout of some 
nature, followed by a salad of endive 
and some stewed fruit, with a final 
cup of coffee, clear and dark as a trout 
brook in the mountains. "You find 
the little repast good?" the host 
questioned, his eyes lighting as I an- 
swered: "Perfect, monsieur. You 
have an extraordinary cook. I would 
like much to talk with her." 

"A pleasure for her, also," he re- 
plied; and now he hesitated. "If 
madame is not afraid to come to a 
meeting this or some other evening at 
pleasure, she will have opportunity. 
At present she is too occupied ; for all 
this is her work, with a young girl who 
is her aid, as I also. For I serve her 
where I can, and would gladly do more." 

A beautiful look had come to his 
dark eyes; for she had neared him 
again in her comings and goings, and 
now was bending over a young pair at 
the end of the table, patting one of 
them on the shoulder as she spoke. 
All turned to her whenever she came 
near; and the atmosphere of the place 
was that of happy, quiet home enjoy- 
ment. Each shook hands as they 
went out, pausing for another word 
or two, the youngest giving a little wave 
of his cap as he cried, 1 1 Vive La Verit6 ! " 
and threw a kiss to the little maid, 
whose flushed cheeks and long braids 
of fair hair just then appeared in the 
doorway. 

"Come over to the Luxembourg for 
a few minutes before we cross the river," 
Bert said, "and I'll tell you all about

them." And, as we went the square 
or two before green grass and trees 
were reached again, the tale began 
as we went. They were Russian An- 
archists of so acute an order that they 
were always under police surveillance, 
and they fed half their needy com- 
patriots in Paris. The wife had, at 



one time, studied with Julian, but 
chose her present method of exist- 
ence, because so she could give a kind 
of help impossible otherwise, and her 
skill as cook amounted to genius. 
Later more will follow as to the life 
she lived, and, it may be, some of 
the methods of "La Verity." 



A Bit of Perfume 

By Mrs. E. M. Lucas 



THE housewife who loves sweet 
scents should utilize nature's 
ready-made materials, and 
gather during the summer months a 
goodly supply to sweeten the winter 
days. 

Ordinary, manufactured odor can 
never take the place of the dainty fra- 
grance of dried rose petals, clover- 
heads, tips of lavender, and sweet- 
scented geranium leaves. 

The old-fashioned hundred-leaved 
rose and Provence rose are the best for 
pot-pourri and for filling dainty rose 
cushions. 

"Dried rose-geranium leaves are equal 
to rose petals for filling cushions and 
sachet bags. Sewn up in little Swiss 
muslin, or thin silk, bags, and tacked 
to the corsage lining of a gown, they 
communicate a dainty perfume to the 
wearer. Little bags of the dried petals 
may be hung on the hooks in the closet, 
and the perfume will creep into every 
fold of the gowns that hang over them. 
The dresser drawers may be covered 
with pads of thin silk, quilted in with 
sweet petals; and stationery perfumed 
with dried roses will exhale an aroma 
of refined allurement. 

To dry the rose petals, gather full- 
blown but perfect flowers, not roses 
past their prime. Cull them in the 



early morning, before the sun has 
sucked up their sweetness. Pull apart, 
rejecting stem and calyx. Spread on 
papers in a cool shady place. Turn 
the petals until well dried, then store 
in close receptacles until wanted. One 
can add to the rose leaves dried leaves 
of lemon verbena, lemon balm, sweet 
basil, which has a perfume of cloves, 
and all sorts of sweet-smelling gera- 
nium leaves. 

Dried spicy clove pinks are quite 
as sweet as rose leaves for filling cush- 
ions; and, to add bulk, use the soft 
fuzz of the cat-tails. There is an enor- 
mous amount of down in each cat-tail; 
and one has but to gather and lay 
them away in closed boxes, in a warm 
place, until they ripen. 

Lavender leaves give the bed linen 
a dainty perfume to woo mortals to 
slumber; and for table linen dry clover- 
heads, and tuck little bags filled with 
them between napkins and table-cloths. 

The common flag-root, or Calamus, 
furnishes a perfume equal to sweet 
violets. The root is dug, washed, cut 
in slices, and dried in the shade. It 
is then coarsely powdered and liber- 
ally sprinkled over cotton, which is 
encased in thin silk. Cushions filled 
with the tips of balsam fir are a com- 
fort for tired heads; and for the nervous

invalid nothing is so soothing as a 
mixture of dried lavender flowers mixed 
with an equal bulk of rose petals and 
one-fourth their bulk of lemon thyme. 
Thyme has always been called a brain 
stimulant. Our forebears, ages ago, 
knew of its soothing power. 

A pot-pourri jar is a delightful thing 
to have in the house, and now is the 
season to make one. Many a nervous 
headache is cured by inhaling a whiff 
of the spicy odors, and the delightful 
perfume emanating from it penetrates 
to every part of the room. To make 
trie jar, take a quart of rose petals, 
place in layers with half a pint of fine 
salt. The petals can be gathered from 
day to day, if a sufficient quantity is 
not on hand. Cover closely, and let 
remain a week, stirring twice a day. 
At the end of this time it presents a 
moist compound. Add, now, half an 
ounce of allspice and the following: 
one-fourth ounce, each, of cloves, cin- 
namon, and nutmeg; one ounce, each, 
of powdered orris or sweet-flag root 
and coriander seed. This is the stock, 
which must be added to every jar, 
made in the same manner. 



In season one can add all kinds 
of fragrant things, such as lavender 
flowers, clover-heads, sweet-geranium 
leaves, violets, vanilla beans, bits of 
lemon verbena, orange and lemon 
peels, clove pinks, and so on, a 
little of each. Be careful to keep 
covered closely for at Least three months. 
Time will strengthen the perfume; 
and, the older it becomes, the better 
will it be. Shake the jar occasionally, 
and open only during the daily odor- 
izing given to the apartments. 

There is no flower or aromatic whose 
perfume cannot be held by the simple 
process of infusing the petals or leaves 
in olive oil. In the bottom of a wide- 
mouthed bottle put a layer of oil- 
saturated cotton, on this pack petals 
or leaves, then more oiled cotton, and 
so on, until the jar is full. Cover 
closely, and let remain twenty-four 
hours. Renew the leaves or petals 
until the oil is of requisite strength. 
This oil pressed from the cotton, cut 
with a gill of alcohol to a teaspoon of 
oil, and diluted with half a pint of 
distilled water, gives a delightfully per- 
fumed toilet water. 



"Traveler's Joy" 

By Helen Knight Wyman 



When on some country road you pass, 
And see the daisies in the grass 
And buttercups that gayly grow, 
On slender stalks swayed to and fro, — 
Don't gather every flower in view: 
Leave some for those who follow you! 

When, walking in the city street, 
Some obstacle you chance to meet 
Remove it with a loving care, 
Lest to some foot it prove a snare: 
•Tis but a kindly thing to do, — 
Think of the feet that follow- you! 



And, as on life's highway you go, 
Sow seeds of love, and love will grow! 
Remove the stumbling-blocks aside, — 
Self-seeking, jealousy, and pride, — 
Lest other feet should stumble, too, 
The tender feet that" follow you. 

And, when at last these paths you leave, 
Some tears shall fall, some hearts shall grieve, 
Safer and better be the road 
Which once you travelled with your load, 
And men be kinder and more true 
Because their footsteps follow you! 



June Breakfasts 

By Marjorie March 



JUNE breakfasts can have that 
most delicious of all accompani- 
ments, if a housekeeper so wish, — 
the taste of out-of-doors! If you 
are not in the habit of havirfg summer 
breakfasts out of doors, give it a trial, 
now that June has come with her 
warm breath and her floral gifts. If 
a house has a porch connecting with 
cither the dining-room or a room near 
the kitchen, the breakfast is an easy 
matter to arrange. Have a plain 
deal table of convenient size spread 
with a small table cover, a big bowl 
of roses or other June flowers in the 
centre, and the breakfast service with 
the fruit course ready laid, when the 
breakfast hour arrives. The rest of 
the meal is brought in on trays by the 
maid ; and a small table may be placed 
on the piazza to deposit these trays 
upon, the family helping themselves 
to any further needs. Another method 
of serving the out-of-door breakfast 
is to have each individual breakfast 
brought on a square tray, the table 
having only the" coffee service and 
basket of fruit as the centre-piece. 

This breakfast is natural, delight- 
fully informal, and any housekeeper 
will find that it makes quite a saving 
of work to the maid, who soon finds 
it easy to plan; while the setting of 
the table is done away with, as the 
trays may all be arranged at one time 
on the kitchen table, and carried out 
at the last moment with their steam- 
ing hot burdens. Then the serving 
is over, until the table is cleared. I 
give below a few simple June break- 
fasts. 



Serve the strawberries in little wicker 
baskets. These may be bought for 
five cents apiece, and used repeatedly, 
if a lining is placed inside. Have these 
at each place, a plate with powdered 
sugar and little cream jug at one side. 
A big basket of roses may grace the 
centre of the table; and a jaunty bow 
of ribbon, tied on the handle of each 
basket, will give the table additional 
color. The trays are then brought. 
Each one has upon it a hot plate, knife 
and fork, two spoons, and a napkin; 
a small covered saucer with the cereal; 
individual omelet, garnished with pars- 
ley, served on two slices of ham. A 
larger tray is placed before the mis- 
tress of the table, and has upon it the 
coffee-pot, cream for coffee and cereal, 
sugar, and the cups and saucers. The 
rolls are also served on a large plate, 
covered with a napkin. 



Strawberries. Cream of Wheat. Coffee. 
Cold Boiled Ham. Omelet with Parsley. 

Hot Rolls. 



Cherries. Oatmeal Slices with Cream. 

Fish Chops. Creamed Potatoes. 

Muffins. Coffee. 

The cherries are placed on the table 
at each place on plates edged with 
fresh grape leaves. A sm&U straw hat 
filled with cherries, a few green leaves 
gracefully grouped among them, makes 
a pretty centre-piece. A soft gray- 
green ribbon, tied in a bow, and fastened 
by its two ends to the edges, makes a 
dainty handle. Oatmeal slices with 
cream are a good substitute for a 
cereal on a hot day, and have the ad- 
ditional advantage of being a "left- 
over." The oatmeal, left over the 
preceding day, is packed in a round 
tin (a pound baking-powder tin makes 
an excellent mould). The whole is 
turned out, and round slices are cut 
from the form. These are dipped in

granulated sugar, and the cream is 
served in small jugs. 

Fish chops are, also, partly made 
the day before. Salmon or fresh fish, 
left over from a baked fish, is carefully 
picked. Add a drop or two of Worces- 
tershire sauce, one well-beaten egg f 
seasoning, and a cup of white sauce. 
Set away until cold and hard. In the 
morning mould into chop-shape, stick 
a piece of macaroni in the end of each 
for a chop bone, roll in beaten egg f 
dip into bread crumbs, and fry in deep 
fat. Garnish the dish with slices of 
lemon and parsley. The creamed po- 
tato, for an individual breakfast, may 
be served in little cups without han- 
dles. The muffins may be either of 
Graham or white flour. 



Shredded Wheat Biscuit with Strawberries. 
Bacon Sliced Thin. Stuffed Eggs. 
Buttered Toast. Coffee. 

Shredded wheat biscuit, for those 
who are fond of them, make a good 
accompaniment to strawberries. Split 
in halves, pile selected berries on each 
half, sprinkle with sugar, and serve 
with cream. Bacon sliced very thin 
and fried makes a good breakfast with 
stuffed eggs. These are made as fol- 
lows: Boil eight eggs hard, let cool 
thoroughly, and cut into halves length- 
wise. Keep halves in pairs. Put 
yolks through ricer, add a drop or 
two of some relish or sauce, with salt 
and pepper to taste. Mix to a smooth 
paste. Fill halves of eggs level with 
the mixture, put together, and fasten 
through ends with wooden tooth-picks, 
roll in beaten egg 9 then in crumbs, 
and fry in deep fat until golden brown. 
Remove tooth-picks, place on platter 
with slices of bacon around, and gar- 
nish the dish with nasturtium leaves. 
The centre-piece may be a green bowl 
filled with nasturtiums; or the little 
yellow bowls bought at Oriental shops 



are charming for flowers of yellow 
hue. A housekeeper who always served 
hot buttered toast with afternoon 
tea taught me a little " trick of the 
trade' ' that is useful to know. She 
had one or two little loaves of bread 
baked in little round tins (baking- 
powder tins are again useful for this 
purpose). The round slices are most 
attractive for toast, and give a trim 
look to the breakfast dish, always 
popular. 

» 
Another pretty light breakfast has 

for its centrepiece a large basket made 
of birch bark, and filled with the dainty 
little yellow roses that were our grand- 
mother's favorites. Strawberries are 
served in small birch-bark cases. 
Cream of wheat or hominy, that has 
been packed in cups, is served in round 
mould shapes, cold, with cream and 
sugar. These are encircled with tiny 
ferns. The main dish is bluefish 
broiled, with butter sauce and sliced 
lemon. French fried potatoes are also 
served with the fish. Small tea biscuit, 
hot, are eaten with orange marmalade; 
and the coffee, is served in pretty yel- 
low cups. A bunch of yellow roses 
graces each place. 

Housekeepers often exclaim over 
any description of floral decoration 
for the table, "Oh, I could not take 
so much trouble !" They are content 
with a poor little bouquet for summer; 
and in winter the jardiniere of ferns 
wears out its beauty, until it dies 
of responsibility. Ten minutes given 
to beautifying the table will pay 
over and over again; and though 
the menus be repeated, as they must 
be sometimes, a different dress will 
make the viands a surprise. June is 
just brimming over with gifts; and 
the housewife may capture many 
of them to make her house what 
it should ever be, — "a thing of 
beauty. "

bing men of the responsibility which 
gives them force and success in their 
natural office of dispenser of wealth to 
the family. 

"In a word, the truth about woman 
in industry is, she is a frightful failure." 



LOVE FOR WORK 

LOVE of the work — content- 
ment as President Eliot puts it 
r — is the key to the solution of 
the labor problem. By enthusiasm we 
overcome obstacles and reach the 
final goal. People are very likely 
to gain, at least in a measure, that 
which they most earnestly strive for. 
Difficulty after difficulty is overcome, 
and the object or end, long sought per- 
haps, is at last attained. The single 
eye, or desire to win, is the secret 
to all successful achievement. "The 
ideal man is a worker," or, as Carlyle 
tells us, "the captains of the world 
have been the leaders of industry." 

On the contrary, nothing good can 
come out of dissatisfaction and dis- 
content. We do best that which we 
are fond of doing, and a work well 
done always brings to the doer its own 
rich reward of pleasure and satisfaction. 

Perhaps no kind of work is more wont 
to be irksome than that of housekeep- 
ing; and one reason for this is that it 
is done so poorly. The atmosphere 
of contentment is wanting. To rem- 
edy this, the kitchen in our homes 
should be thoughtfully planned and 
well equipped with the best-known 
appliances. The accessories and fa- 
cilities for good work should be suit- 
able and convenient. In a word, 
a kit of tools and proper materials are 
quite essential to good workmanship. 
Whereas too often the kitchen is the 
most ill-constructed and worst neg- 
lected part of the house, the aim being 
not so much to simplify processes as to 
cheapen them, not so much to secure 
the best results as to limit the cost of 



living. We must not forget the fact 
that good work of every class calls for 
generous outlay of both money and 
labor. 

But, above all else, the zeal of the 
workman is best conducive to the high- 
est ends. As a recent writer so well 
says: "Honest work springs from the 
heart. It cannot be done without an 
intrinsic love for it. It is the honor 
and the love that are put into it that 
glorify the work. 'According to a 
law of worship, a devotee can never 
rise above the God he worships. So 
a man who devotes himself to art or 
to trade or the professions becomes 
identified with the principles embodied 
in the sciences and arts. If his work 
is done nobly, he becomes himself 
noble.' We must get rid of the false 
sentiment that grades different ranks 
of work as more or less respectable. 
It is cleanly and honest doing that gives 
rank to the task. " 



WITH the present issue we 
begin a new volume, and 
we design that in quantity 
and quality of content it shall excel 
all preceding volumes. The maga- 
zine is conducted solely in the inter- 
ests of its subscribers, who, in the 
main, are intelligent housekeepers; and 
we think we can safely say that in its 
own special field — domestic science or 
practical cookery — it has no superior 
(in fact, no rival) either in this country 
or in Europe. The wants of our sub- 
scribers are our wants, their wishes are 
our wishes. We like to renew their 
subscriptions from year to year. We 
like still better to make those renewals 
on receipt of the names of two friends 
as new subscribers. May we not hope, 
through the co-operation of our pres- 
ent readers and our own efforts, greatly 
to increase our circulation, and thus, 
in like measure, enlarge the scope and 
enhance the practical utility of the

When flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant, 
tablespoonful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a Itvel spoonful of such material. 



Fresh Fish Chowder (Fresh Fish) 
Cod, haddock, lake fish, pickerel, 
bass, etc., are all good in chowders. 
The fish needs be very fresh. Skin 
the fish, and remove the flesh from 
the bones in two long fillets. Cut 
these in two-inch pieces, and set aside 
in a cool place. Cover the head, 
body-bones, and trimmings with cold 
water, let come slowly to the boiling- 
point, then simmer half an hour. For 
three or four pounds of fish try out 
the fat from two or three ounces of 
fat salt pork, cut into tiny bits. In 
this saute an onion, cut in thin slices, 
without discoloring the onion. Add 
the contents of the pan, rinsing well, 



to the saucepan in which the head, etc., 
are simmering, and strain the liquid 
over the fish. Have ready a scant 
quart of sliced potatoes, parboiled 
in water and drained. Add these 
to the fish with one tablespoonful 
of salt and a generous dash of pa- 
prika, and let simmer until the potatoes 
are tender. Then add three cups 
of hot milk or tomato puree (cooked

night, or a little longer, to freshen it. 
Put on to boil in cold water. Let 
come slowly to boil, and cook from 
two to five minutes according to 
thickness of fish. Pour off the water, 
and mash the fish fine; and to every 
cup of fish add two cups of mashed 
potato and a little milk, pepper, and 
butter. Mash and mix all thoroughly 
together. Put on in a spider half a 
cup of fine-chopped, fat, salt pork, fry 
out the fat slightly, and add one small, 
fine-chopped onion. 
Brown slightly, and 
then add the pre- 
pared fish and po-

browned, turn onto 
a heated platter, and 
serve. 

Young Pigeons 

with Asparagus 
Tips 

Truss four or five 
pigeons, carefully cleaned-and- picked, 
as for roasting, then saute in butter 
or bacon fat until colored delicately, 
turning as needed, to insure even 
cooking. Then remove to an earthen 



casserole or agate pan that may be 
covered closely. In the frying-pan 
saute* an onion and one or two 
young carrots, sliced thin. When 
browned delicately, pour over 
a cup and a half of boiling 
water, add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and let simmer 
three or four minutes, then 
pour over the pigeons. Cover 
the dish, and let cook in a 
moderate oven until tender. 
It will take about an hour 
and a half, even four or more 
hours, if the pigeons are not 
young. Strain off the broth. 
thicken with three tablespoonfuls of 
butter, creamed with three tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, let simmer six or eight 
minutes, then stir in the yolks of two 
eggs, beaten and diluted with one- 
fourth a cup of cream. Let thicken 
without boiling. Add a tablespoonful 
(scant) of lemon juice, a dash of pa- 
prika, salt, if needed, and a bunch of 
asparagus, cut in half-inch lengths 
and simmered until tender in a little 
boiling salted water. (Add the liquid 



Graham Bread and Pullman-sandwich Loaf-pan (See page 19) 



in which the asparagus was simmered.) 
Turn the asparagus into a serving- 
dish, and above it dispose the pigeons, 
cut in halves. This dish is particu- 
larly good.

Guinea Fowl en 
Casserole 
Truss two fowl, 
neatly cleaned, and 
set them in a casse- 
role. Cut two small 
onions in slices, also 
slice one or two new 
carrots or part of 
an old one. Saute 
these in fat, tried 
out from a slice or 
two of bacon, until nicely browned. 
Then add a cup and a half of boil- 
ing water or stock, and turn the 
whole over the fowl in the casse- 
role. Cover, and set to cook in the 
oven. If the fowl are young and 
tender as they should be, they will 
be cooked in from one hour and a

adding another egg, 
less flour may be

only ingredient in the 
cakes that requires much cooking: and, 
as griddle cakes are baked very quick-

flour as much as possible.

air bubbles will not be broken down 
very thoroughly; and the dough will 
soon be ready for the oven. 
This quantity is just the 
right amount to bake

pan. When baked, the pan 
should be filled evenly. 

Tomato Salad with 

Horseradish Dressing 

Chill the tomatoes, peel, re-

Dispose on heart leaves of 
lettuce, well- washed -and-dried, or on 
short sprigs of cress, and pipe a 
cream dressing, to which grated horse- 
radish has been added, upon the 
tomato. 

Cream Horseradish Dressing 
To three-fourths a cup of sweet 
double cream add about fifteen drops 
of onion juice, two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, one of which may be tarragon, 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, of 
salt and paprika. Beat until solid,

taken from the bottle, less vinegar will 
be required. If preferred, the onion 
juice may be omitted from the dressing, 
and the prepared tomatoes set to chill 



Rhubarb Pie (See page 33] 

Serving Cucumber Salad 
To retain the proper crispness in 
a cucumber salad, serve the cucumbers, 
thoroughly crisped in ice water before 
drying and dressing, on a glass dish 
set into a second dish filled with 
crushed ice. Or fill a salad bowl with 
crushed ice, make a depression in the 
centre and line this carefully with 
the outer leaves of a head of lettuce, 
thus making a bowl that will hold the 
most of the dressing, and into this put 
the dressed cucumbers. 

Cress, Cucumber-and-Veal 
Salad 
Use cold roast veal, or, if 
this be not at hand, cover a 
thick slice of raw veal with 
boiling water or stock, add 
half a dozen slices, each, of 
onion and carrot and part of 
a bay leaf, and let boil five 
minutes, then simmer until the 
meat is tender, from one to two 
hours. Let the meat cool 
partially in the broth, and, 
when cold, cut in half-inch cubes. Mix 
a cup and a half of the cubes with 
about three tablespoonfuls of oil, a dash 
of pepper and salt, and nearly a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, then set aside, 



Seasonable Recipes 



covered, in a cool place for an hour or 
more. When about ready to serve, 
cut a cucumber, chilled and pared in 
slices, and stamp out 
three rounds from 
each slice. Reserve 
four slices from the 
trimmings to garnish 
the dish, and chop 
the rest fine. Let 
stand in ice water 
to become chilled. 
Remove the coarse 
ends from a bunch of 
cress, wash the rest thoroughly, shake, 
and wrap loosely in a cheese-cloth, and 
let stand on the ice half an hour or 
more. When ready to serve, dry the 
vegetables, by shaking them in a cloth 
and exposing to the air a short time. 
Drain the meat, if needed. Dress the 
cucumbers and cress with onion juice, 
oil, salt, pepper, and vinegar, using 
only what is needed to coat them 
thoroughly. Mix the meat with ma- 
yonnaise dressing. Dispose a 
bed of cress on a serving- 
dish, and across the cress, 
diagonally, a band of cucum- 
bers. Fill in the two remain- 
ing quarters with the veal. 
Put the reserved slices above, 
one in each quarter, and fill 
the open spaces with mayon- 
naise dressing. 

Orange Jelly Cups with 

Strawberries 
Soften half a two -ounce 
package of gelatine in half 
a cup of cold water. Add 
half a cup of boiling water, 
and, when dissolved, half a 
cup of sugar. Strain over 
a cup of orange juice and 
the juice of a lemon. Use to fill char- 
lotte russe moulds. When set, re- 
move from the moulds onto serving- 
dishes covered with paper doilies, unless 
they are to be surrounded with fruit 



or whipped cream. Let stand in the 
refrigerator, to stiffen again. Then use 

as a receptacle for sliced berries, orange 



Strawberry Cream Cakes 

or pineapple pulp, mixed with sugar. 
Used as a dessert dish, whipped cream 
may be added, and the jelly case may 
be of larger size than if the dish is in- 
tended for an appetizer or a first course. 

Strawberry Cream Cakes 
Melt half a cup of butter in a cup of 
boiling water. When the whole boils, 
stir in one cup of sifted flour, and con- 
tinue stirring until the mixture forms 



a ball. Then turn into a mixing-bowl, 
and beat in, one at a time, three large 
or four small eggs. Beat in each egg 
thoroughly, before another is added. 
Shape into oval cakes on a buttered

baking-sheet, and bake about twenty- 
five minutes. When done, the cakes 
will feel light, taken up in the hand. 



Pineapple Cake, St. Honore (See page 3)) 

Remove at once to a wire -cooler. 
When cool and ready to serve, cut 
the cakes open upon one side and a 
little above the middle, put in one or 
two tablespoonfuls of fresh straw- 
berries, cut in halves and sugared gen- 
erously. Above the berries put one or 
two tablespoonfuls of whipped cream, 
and shake powdered sugar over the 
top of the crust. Use strawberry pre- 
serves, when fresh strawberries are un- 
seasonable. Raspberries and sliced 
peaches are, also, good in the place of 
the strawberries. 



row, others of oval form. Fill, when 
cold, with strawberry cream. Use a 
bag and star tube. Sift powdered 
sugar over the oval cakes, and spread 
the others with strawberry frosting. 

Strawberry Cream Filling 
Press strawberries, washed - and - 
drained, through a potato ricer. Dis- 
card as many seeds as possible. To a cup 
of double cream add a cup of the 
strawberry pulp and juice, half a cup 
of sugar, and, if convenient, a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Beat until 
thick to the bottom of the bowl. Chill, 
and use to fill eclairs or as a char- 
lotte russe filling, or as filling for 
orange, lemon, or pineapple jelly cups. 
Except for a charlotte russe filling, it 
is preferable to defer putting in place 
until just before serving. For a char- 
lotte russe filling, vanilla is often used 
instead of the lemon juice. 

Strawberry Frosting 
Cook half a cup of strawberries, half 
a cup of sugar, and two or three table- 
spoonfuls of water very slowly, until 
the berries are softened and the syrup

Seasonable Recipes 



33 



Strawberry Shortcake (Cold) 

Bake sponge cake in a round tin, 
choosing a size that will give a cake 
about two inches and a half thick when 
baked. Cut out the centre of the cake, 
leaving a rim about an inch wide, with 
a hollow an inch and a half deep. 
Cover the rim and the side of the cake 
with strawberry frosting. When about 
ready to serve, fill in the open space 
with sliced strawberries, well sugared, 
and dot here and there with stars of 
whipped cream. 

Rhubarb Pie 

Peel the rhubarb, and cut in pieces 
rather less than an inch in length. 
Cover these with boiling water, set 
over the fire, and quickly bring the 
whole to the boiling-point. Let cook 
a moment, or until the rhubarb changes 
color, but without losing its shape, 
then drain, pressing out the liquid. 
Over a generous pint of the cooked 
rhubarb sprinkle a cup of sugar, sifted 
with three tablespoonfuls of flour and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt. Add 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice or a 
grating of orange rind. Mix without 
breaking the rhubarb any more than 
is necessary, and turn into a plate 
lined with puff paste. Lay narrow 
bands of pastry over the top of the 
filling, lattice-fashion, and finish with 
a broader band on the edge. Brush 
the paste with cold water before the 
bands are put in place. Bake about 
half an hour, or until the pastry is 
thoroughly baked and browned. 

Pineapple Cake, St. Honore Style 

Cut a thin round of pastry, plain or 
puff, nine or ten inches in diameter, 
dispose on a baking-sheet, and brush 
over the edge with cold water. With 
a pastry bag and tube press a circle 
of chou paste (cream cake mixture) 
upon the edge of the pastry, to form a 
border. Prick the round of pastry with 



a fork, and brush over the chou paste 
with beaten egg (to glaze it). Bake 
about twenty minutes in an oven with 
strong heat on the bottom. When 
the paste is cold, set onto a serving- 
dish, and dispose on the border half- 
slices of pineapple, either of fresh pine- 
apple, sugared, or pineapple cooked in 
a syrup and cooled. In the centre pipe 
pineapple Bavarian cream, and insert 
here and there quarter slices of pine- 
apple. 

Pineapple Bavarian Cream 

Scald one pint of grated pineapple, 
juice and pulp. Soften half a two- 
ounce package of gelatine (generous 
measure at this season) in half a cup 
of cold water. Add the gelatine, dis- 
solved by setting in hot water, to the 
pineapple, also the juice of half a lemon 
and one cup of sugar. Stir the mixture, 
set in a pan of ice and water, until it 
begins to thicken, then gradually add 
the whip from three cups of single 
cream or one cup of double cream and 
one cup of rich milk, beaten solid. 
In adding the cream, especially at first, 
the greatest care needs be taken to 
mix it evenly through the entire mixt- 
ure. Otherwise, when finished, solid 
pieces of stiff gelatine mixture will be 
scattered throughout, thus destroying 
the smoothness and delicacy of the 
whole. In the illustration, the pine- 
apple cream was tinted pink with the 
contents of the little package found in 
some of the cartons of gelatine. 

Hot Water Sponge Cake 

Beat the yolks of three eggs very 
light, then beat in, gradually, one cup 
of sugar. Add the grated rind of half 
a lemon, a teaspoonful of the juice, and 
half a cup of boiling water. When 
well mixed, fold in one cup of sifted 
flour, sifted again with one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of salt, and then the whites 
of three eggs, beaten dry. Bake in a 
pan, buttered and floured or lined with 



34 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



buttered paper, in a moderate oven. A 
pan six inches by ten is of proper 
size for this cake. Sift granulated sugar 
over the top of the cake before putting 
it into the oven. 

One Egg Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter; add grad- 
ually a cup of sugar, then one beaten 
egg t and, alternately, one cup of milk 
and two cups of flour sifted with one 
teaspoonful of soda and three and one- 
half (level) teaspoonfuls of cream of 
tartar. Four level teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing-powder may replace the soda and 
cream of tartar. One cup of raisins or 
currants may be added for a change. 
Or the cake may be covered with a 
chocolate frosting. 

Sand Tarts (B. H. S.) 

Cream ten ounces (one cup and a 
fourth) of butter, and gradually work 
into it one pound (four cups) of flour, 
scant measure. When these are evenly 
blended, gradually mix in one pound of 
granulated sugar, then the yolks of two 
large eggs and the white of one egg t 
beaten together. Cover the dough 
closely, and allow it to stand over- 
night. Next day roll into a very thin 
sheet, using as little flour as possible. 
Cut into shapes with a round cutter. 
Dip a pastry brush into beaten white 
of egg (the white of one is reserved 
for this purpose) and brush over each 
tart. Put half the kernel of a shell- 
bark walnut in the centre of each, 
dredge with granulated sugar, and 
bake at once. 

Ice-cream Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter. Add, 
gradually, one cup of fine granulated 
sugar, then, alternately, half a cup of 
milk and one cup of flour, and half a 
cup of cornstarch, sifted with four level 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Lastly, 



add the stiff-beaten whites of four 
eggs. Bake in a sheet, cover with 
confectioner's or boiled frosting, and 
sprinkle with chopped pistachio nuts. 

Brandy Snaps 

Melt half a cup of butter and stir in 
one cup, each, of molasses and sugar. 
When thoroughly mixed, stir in one cup 
of flour. Drop by spoonfuls onto a 
buttered sheet : they will spread in bak- 
ing. Bake carefully, to avoid burning. 
When well browned, roll in such shape 
as desired. 

Crnsini 

Sift half a pound of flour (two cups 
of unsifted flour) into a mixing-bowl. 
Add two ounces (one- fourth a cup) of 
butter beaten to a cream, one whole egg 
and the white of another beaten without 
separating, a tablespoonful of milk, a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of cay- 
enne. Mix thoroughly, and knead to a 
smooth paste. Roll out into thin round 
strips about four inches long. Lay 
these on a buttered baking-sheet, brush 
over with milk, sprinkle with coarse salt, 
and bake in a quick oven about ten 
minutes. 

Ham Souffle 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and cook in this a slice of onion with- 
out browning. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, a dash of paprika, and, 
gradually, two cups of milk. Let boil 
two minutes, then strain over half a 
cup of bread crumbs and a pint of fine- 
chopped ham. Mix thoroughly, and 
stir through the mixture the yolks of 
three eggs, beaten light, and fold in the 
whites of three eggs, beaten dry. Turn 
into a buttered baking-dish, set into a 
pan of hot water, and bake about 
twenty-five minutes. Serve at once. 
Tomato pur6e may take the place of 
the milk.

SHE knew that the gift of cooking was not vouchsafed by God to her; but sometimes she 
would do her best, by intellect to win it. Whereas it is no more to be won by intellect 
than is divine poetry. An amount of strong, quick heart is needful, and the understanding 
must second it, in the one art as in the other. — Lorna Doone. 



OCCASIONALLY we hear a 
woman say: "My cooking and 
housekeeping do not trouble 
me in the least. The baker and the 
grocer solve all my perplexities for 
me." Another exclaims, "We never 
bake bread through the summer, and 
often not for weeks during the greater 
part of the year!" Bread is the one 
article on the table that everybody 
eats, and especially during the summer 
season it is eaten largely with berries, 
etc. Is the child hungry, "Give him 
a slice of bread and butter," is the uni- 
versal dictum. But, verily, the ma- 
jority of bakers' loaves, if they be not, 
might e'en as well be stones. Fer- 
mentation brought about by living 
yeast plants (found in half-baked 
bread) in the human stomach is the 
chief source of many a case of indiges- 
tion and malnutrition. 

We are doubtless gainers, in that the 
weaving of cloth and the making of 
shoes has been transferred to factories. 
Undoubtedly, we get better-made and 
more cleanly butter now that this prod- 
uct is prepared in creameries; and in 
time, bakers' bread may rival in cost, 
texture, and wholesomeness the bread 
made in the generality of homes. But 
did we ever investigate the places in 
which the overlight, undercooked loaf 
of to-day is prepared and cooked? 
There are clean bakeries, but we fear 
these are rare exceptions rather than 



the rule. Call to mind those near by. 
Are they not located in dark, back 
rooms and even in cellars, the few 
windows obscured by "the dust of 
years"? 

You say: "you do not wish to keep 
a fire in hot weather, and it is too much 
work to make bread." One can bake 
an oven full of bread in just one hour, 
and that, too, if need be, in the oven 
of a gas or oil stove. Prepared at 
night, bread may be baked at six or 
seven in the morning! while one is 
getting breakfast. Simply mix the 
dough the last thing before retiring, 
using one-fourth a cake of compressed 
yeast to a pint of liquid. If one have 
a ' 'bread-maker," put in the liquid, salt, 
sugar, and yeast after the dishes are 
washed at night, then just before going 
to bed stir in the flour, thus mixing 
and kneading in five minutes or less. 
A bread-maker is a practical utensil 
giving good results; but the bread is 
rather better, if its work be supple- 
mented by a slight kneading of the 
dough, when it is shaped for the pans. 
If one make bread in the morning, use 
two yeast cakes, thus shortening the 
process. Afraid of so much yeast! 
Kill germs by long and thorough bak- 
ing, and go on your way rejoicing. 

But there are so many things to do 
that one must cut off some of the 
work. Cut off superfluous cares, and 
attend to the necessities; but do not 



In Reference to Menus and Recipes 



39 



try to cut off too much work. Women 
seem to have acquired a mania for 
eliminating all the sensible duties per- 
formed by their grandmothers. 

We often take more time and exert 
ourselves in greater measure, in trying 
to eliminate work, than it would cost 
to do the work twice over. The only 
way is to make up our minds what 
is essential to do, then do it without 
thinking how hard or disagreeable it 
is. Before we are aware, the thing is 
done. To hesitate, vacillate, or dread 
is far worse for us than the actual 
effort. 

But what is it that we wish to do in 
place of these necessary duties? To 
read, even stories, becomes monoto- 
nous; to lounge on the piazza and 
gossip* with a neighbor, or to work over 
a bit of embroidery, does not refresh 
us as a task well done. The great 
thing in life is to enjoy the work we 
have to do, be it what it may. No 
woman can ever be supremely happy 
until she becomes absorbed in work. 
She must feel that her work is the 
most important thing in life. Then, 
and perhaps not till then, will she 
thoroughly enjoy making sweet, nutty 
loaves of bread. 



We have many inquiries for some- 
thing absolutely new to eat. At the 
present time the discovery of a really 
new article of food is of such rare 
occurrence that we are justified in 
saying none such are to be dis- 
covered. Of course, there maybe arti- 
cles of food new to us, but some one 
else has already known and partaken of 
them. The most of our so-called new 
or original dishes are made from arti- 
cles of food which have become famil- 
iar to us through sight, if not through 
taste, but combined after an unusual 
fashion. But, if an article of food be 
new to those for whom it is prepared, — 
even if it has been heard of before, — 
why may not this "fill the biU"? 



There are few who have tasted of every- 
thing that is edible. 

A few days ago, Mr. C. F. Lang- 
worthy, of the United States Depart- 
ment of 'Agriculture, asked us regard- 
ing the cooking of guinea fowls; and, 
notwithstanding that admissions are 
dangerous, we were obliged to admit 
that here was, to us, a "new bird" and 
an undiscovered viand. May not the 
guinea fowl be new, also, to some of 
our readers? 

Rejoicing at the prospect of some- 
thing novel, if not new, to serve at 
our next dinner party, and, later on, 
at the feast spread on our pages, we 
began to make inquiries concerning 
what, we were convinced, would be 
for us a great ' 'scoop." But the pre- 
vailing opinion, in the quarters where 
we sought for information and inspira- 
tion, was that we were welcome to our 
"find"; everybody knew about guinea 
fowls, and that they were little, 
tough, dry birds, etc., etc. Nothing 
sticks like a prejudice. Consulting 
foreign bills of fare, we found that 
abroad, on the continent of Europe, the 
guinea fowl is given a conspicuous 
place in elaborate dinners, where it 
figures as the "American pheasant." 
Truly, it were worth while to try the 
bird at our modest little meal. We 
did, and with such satisfaction that 
hereafter the "American pheasant" 
will be given a deservedly prominent 
place in our cuisine. 

While Northern housekeepers have 
not, very generally, discovered the 
good qualities of this bird, which 
might almost be classed with game, 
our Southern sisters know its full 
value; and, roasted, broiled, or in 
fricassee, it is oft and again the prized 
pQce de resistance of company as well 
as family dinners: while the eggs are 
said not to suffer in comparison with 
those of the plover, which, moulded in 
aspic jelly, furnish one of the choicest 
tidbits of fashionable English dinners. 



The Up-to-date Waitress 



WITH this number, and under 
the foregoing heading, we are 
to begin a series of articles 
to include all the subjects that would 
naturally be of special interest to a wait- 
ress or to those who employ waitresses. 
The phase of the subject taken up 
in this issue is not necessarily that with 
which such a series should begin; nor 
will the papers that follow be given 
in systematic order, but rather as the 
matter seems desirable and seasonable. 
In the August-September number, 
we will consider the duties of the wait- 
ress, when a picnic is to be planned 
and carried out; and, in the October 
number, her duties in connection with 
the preparation and serving of break- 
fasts will be considered. These arti- 
cles will be fully illustrated. 

The Serving of Butter 
Butter is served at breakfast, lunch- 
eon, and supper, but not at a formal 
dinner. If the luncheon take the 
form of a formal luncheon party, the 
small butter plate is thought prefer- 
able to the bread-and-butter plate, 
which is more Bohemian in character. 
Often neither appears. At a formal 
dinner, the menu of which abounds 
in rich sauces, butter is regarded a 
superfluity, since each dish is supposed 
to be perfect as it is, or with the acces- 
sories provided as accompaniment. 

At a family dinner, especially if 
children, for whom sauces are not de- 
sirable, are given a place at table, butter 
should be in readiness for use on the 
sideboard. The sideboard, rather than 
the serving or side table, seems to be 
the natural place for the disposition 
of this article, as here hot dishes, the 
vicinity of which would be prejudicial 
to the appearance of butter, do not 
appear. 

The appearance of the butter and 



the temperature at which it is served 
may seem very trifling matters, per- 
haps ; but it is in the painstaking atten- 
tion to just such little details as these 
that the true capability of a waitress 
is manifested. 

Occasionally there are homes, to 
which table butter is sent that has 
been worked at the time of churning 
into tiny half-ounce cakes, just large 
enough for a single service. By this 
means, if the butter be carefully manip- 
ulated during the washing and salting, 
the original, granular consistency of 
the substance is retained. This con- 
sistency is always looked for by those 
who are conversant with the qualities 
of good butter. But, when the butter 
for table use is sent to the house in 
the firkin or box, — as is usually the 
case,— then the waitress needs exer- 
cise great care in "working over" the 
butter, to manipulate it as little as 
possible, that the desirable texture be 
not lost. Let her remember to handle 
it just as little as possible, and never 
with anything but properly prepared, 
wooden utensils reserved for this pur- 
pose. 

As some little time is required to 
get the necessary spoon, bowl, butter 
hands, and moulds in suitable condi- 
tion to use, it will be well to take some 
favorable opportunity, and make a 
business of preparing, at one time, the 
butter for several days. It should 
then be set away, carefully covered, 
in the compartment of the refrigerator 
that is reserved for butter, cream, and 
milk. 

To shape Butter 

First of all put the moulds, butter 
hands, or whatever articles are to be 
used, into a wooden bowl filled with 
boiling water, and let stand about half 
an hour, replenishing the water as 



When Mother's in the Kitchen making Jam 



4* 



needed, to keep the same at a high 
temperature. Then empty the bowl 
of water, and refill with cold water, 
adding ice, at the last, if the weather 
be warm. When the utensils are thor- 
oughly chilled, put the butter into the 
bowl of cold water, and with the spoon 
work it, until it be of a consistency to 
shape, but not a moment longer. To 
shape into balls, cut off a level table- 
spoonful, and roll between the butter 
hands and drop onto a cold plate, 
keeping each ball separate. Chill be- 
fore piling into a butter-dish. 

At those meals where butter is served, 
two minutes before announcing the 
meal, with a silver pick put a butter 
ball on each plate, and set a dish with 
a reserve supply and a butter pick 
upon the sideboard. Butter - dishes 
are made with a reservoir below the 
butter for bits of ice. With this ar- 
rangement, when a second serving is 
required, the waitress needs take care 



to drain the water from the melting 
ice before the dish is passed. 

Individual moulds, also moulds to 
shape a half or quarter pound of butter, 
are shown in the illustration. The man- 
ner of use is the same in both cases. In- 
vert the mould, and let the stamp drop 
to the bottom of the mould. Then fill 
the mould with butter, turn it over, 
and with the stamp press out the butter 
onto a chilled plate. Let the butter 
chill thoroughly before using. A quar- 
ter or half pound cake of butter is 
served with a knife. The waitress may 
cut and serve, the butter-dish resting 
meanwhile on a tray, or she may pass 
it to the left of the person to be served, 
who may then cut the butter and place 
it upon the special plate provided for 
this purpose. A dish of butter may 
be garnished with two or three fresh 
clover leaves and blossoms, or with 
a sprig or two of cress or parsley, or 
with nasturtium leaves and blossoms. 



When Mother's in the Kitchen making Jam 

By Ella Eldridge Rockwoo<i 



When the days of spring are over, 

And the fields are full of clover, 
It's a gay and happy youngster that I am ; 

For July brings sweetest pleasure, 

Berries ripen without measure, 
And mother's in the kitchen making jam. 

First she weighs the agate kettle, 

Lets the berries in it settle, 
Then puts sugar just as full as it can cram. 

Cinnamon and allspice mingle, — 

It just makes my lingers tingle, 
When mother's in the kitchen making jam. 



Next upon the fire she sets it, 
Stirs, and gently simmer lets it, 

Ahd I wait with lips shut tight as any clam ; 
While a smell of spicy sweetness 
Seems to tell of its completeness, 

When mother's in the kitchen making jam. 

Then there comes the time of trying, — 

Spoonful in a saucer lying, — 
And of course it's easy guessing where I am ; 

For it's every boy's delight, — 

Putting such things out of sight, — 
When mother's in the kitchen making jam. 



When at last the work is done, 
Then's the time I have my fun; 

For she always says, "You've been a good 
boy, Sam." 
And she lets me scrape the dish 
And lick the spoon. Oh, gee, I wish, — 

Mother's always in the kitchen making jam. 



Savory Summer Soups 

By Frances E. Peck 



SUMMER soups should be daintily 
piquant in character. If they be 
reminiscent of the vegetable gar- 
den and tender, fresh-picked bouquets 
of soup herbs, so much the better. 

If a very light soup be desired, a meat 
or vegetable bouillon, transparent and 
sparkling, with the always-to-be-de- 
sired touch of novelty supplied by the 
garnishings, will be found a very appe- 
tizing prelude. Consommd C£lestine, 
consomm£ au persil, potage & la V6ni- 
tienne, and consomm6 Suedoise all are 
soups, the reputations of which have 
been made in the culinary and epicu- 
rean world by novel garnishings. 

Several of the following recipes were 
taken from an old Frencfy cook-book, 
the date and much-thumbed appearance 
of which gave one confidence as to the 
reliability of its contents : — 

Soup with Parmesan Croutons 

Put into a saucepan a tablespoonful 
of butter and a cube of sugar. Turn 
in a pint of mixed vegetables cut in 
match-like strips, — celery, leeks, car- 
rots, turnips, and young cabbage leaves 
are a good combination, — and let them 
very slowly cook in their own steam. 
When slightly tinged, add three pints of 
clear veal bouillon, and cook till the vege- 
tables are soft. Strain from their liquor, 
and set the latter on the range to keep 
hot while thecroutons are being prepared. 
Cut from a stale Vienna loaf thin little 
disks of bread, dip in melted butter, 
cover with grated Parmesan, and bake 
in a hot oven till crisp and yellow. Do 
not let them stand in the soup, but throw 
them into each plate when serving it. 

Chiffonade 

Make a chiffonade (rags) of a quart 
of sorrel, a head of lettuce, and a hand- 



ful of chevril by cutting them in shreds. 
Throw into cold water while making 
a savory chicken broth by cutting a 
chicken in fifteen or twenty pieces, 
and browning in two ounces of butter. 
Pour over three quarts of veal stock, 
and cook slowly until the meat is ten- 
der. Half an hour before it is done, 
add a leek, cut in pieces, a bunch of 
parsley, and bouquet of soup herbs. 
When the chicken is sufficiently cooked, 
take out the "greenery," and add the 
chiffonade, well drained. Cook five 
minutes, and serve, pouring soup, 
meat, and "rags" into the tureen. 

Puree Fontange 

Put an ounce of butter in a sauce- 
pan, and throw into it, when melted, 
a pint of cultivated sorrel, cleaned, 
washed, and cut, and let stew in its 
own steam, until it can be rubbed 
through a coarse sieve. Season a 
quart of water with a teaspoonful of 
salt. Add a stalk of celery, a pint of 
little green peas, and a tiny sprig of 
mint. Cook until tender, and then 
sieve them. Add an equal . quantity 
of soup stock, the sorrel pur6e, heat to 
the boiling-point, and serve with crou- 
tons. Fontange is a summer soup, pure 
and simple, for it must be made when 
the peas are small and sweet and not 
yet dry. 

Soupe a TOiselle 

Wash well a pint of the leaves and a 
little of the stems of sorrel and a hand- 
ful of spinach leaves, cover with cold 
water, and bring to a boil. When ten- 
der, rub through a sieve, and dilute 
a pint of the green liquid with a pint 
of weak stock that has been flavored 
in the cooking with soup herbs. Put 
over the fire, and add, to a quart, two 



Savory Summer Soups 



43 



potatoes pared and grated and a small 
onion, chopped fine. Cook thirty min- 
utes. Taste for perfect flavor, then 
strain, and add a cup of cream. This 
pur6e is pale green in color and very 
appetizing. 

Puree of Cucumbers 

Take four large cucumbers, pare, cut 
in pieces, and stew in water to cover 
until tender. Rub through a colander, 
and put into a saucepan with a celery 
stalk, some chives, a bay leaf, a tiny 
piece of red pepper, a tablespoonful of 
marrow, a pint of stock, and salt to 
season. Let simmer two hours, re- 
plenishing with weak stock as the 
original amount evaporates. Strain, 
and return to the saucepan. Grate 
two small potatoes, crisped in ice water, 
into the soup, and let cook ten minutes 
more. Strain into a tureen, sprinkle 
with powdered parsley, and serve a 
slice of lemon to each plate. 

Napolitaine 

Cut into small pieces a quarter of 
a raw chicken, and brown well in a 
tablespoonful of butter, with an ounce 
of chopped, raw ham, half a green pep- 
per, a small carrot (sliced), a table- 
spoonful of chives, and a sprig of pars- 
ley. Moisten with three pints of white 
broth, season with salt and white pep- 
per, and let simmer until half cooked, 
then throw in an ounce of broken 
macaroni and a large tomato, cut in 
small pieces. Let boil ten minutes, 
and serve with grated cheese apart. 

Potage d'fite 

This is a summery soup that will 
have a "real" soup taste and not have 
the heating discomfort of a meat soup, 
when the thermometer is flirting in the 
nineties. Pare and quarter two large 
sour apples, and cook in a quart of 
water with a lump of sugar, a teaspoon- 
f ul of butter, and a teaspoonf ul of salt. 



In another saucepan cook two slices 
of bacon to a pale brown, then add 
two cups of cleaned vegetables, cut 
fine, — leeks, onions, carrots, young cab- 
bage, parsley, celery, a bay leaf and 
three pepper-corns. Fry these lightly, 
cover with water, and cook fifteen 
minutes. Strain the apple liquor, color 
with a little caramel, and pour over the 
vegetables. Stir, and put into the 
tureen. A few tender young green 
beans or sweet little peas may be added, 
if at hand. 

Venetian Soup 

Is a light, delicate consomm£, — 
preferably, veal or chicken, — distin- * 
guished by its delicate garnish of 
noodles, thrown in when it is ready 
to serve. For these take two eggs, 
beat separately the yolks and whites, 
mix, and stir in sifted flour, sufficient 
to make a paste which will run from 
the spoon. Bake in a heated griddle 
to a golden brown, using generously 
good butter for frying. While hot 
cut the pancake into the finest possible 
strings, and drop them into the boil- 
ing consomme. 

Consomme Suedoise 

Cut three small Vienna rolls in halves 
(crosswise), and remove the crumbs. 
Brush the slices of crust with melted 
butter and crisp in a slow oven. Make 
a filling of two tablespoonfuls, each, of 
fine-chopped carrot, tender cabbage 
and turnip, two tablespoonfuls of peas, 
and one tablespoonful of string beans, 
sliced. Cook twenty minutes in an 
ounce of butter, covering closely, that 
the vegetables may steam. When soft, 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of grated 
Parmesan. Fill the rolls with this 
mixture, sprinkle the tops with a little 
more cheese and a few drops of drawn 
butter, and run into a hot oven for two 
or three minutes. Serve with hot con- 
somme poured over.

My June Vacation 

FINDING myself much reduced in 
health and strength and needing 
a rest and change, I took into consid- 
eration the ways and means of obtain- 
ing it, on a very limited income, which 
would allow no useless expenditure. 

In going to any resort, I found I 
should need some new clothes, which, 
with travelling expenses and board 
for a month at least, would amount 
to more than I could afford to spend. 
But the rest was absolutely necessary. 
How could it best be obtained? A 
boarding-house opposite and hotel near 
by, where I could get meals from 12 
to 15 cents, I resolved to stay in 
my own comfortable home, close the 
blinds, and live out of doors all the 
time possible. 

With entire freedom from house- 
work and worry, plenty of good read- 
ing, a little fancy-work occasionally for 
recreation, I found life on the sheltered 
porch, or in the hammock under the 
trees in the garden, working wonders; 
while, instead of being tired out with 
my vacation and spending all my 
money, at the end of the month I found 
myself ready to take up the cares of 
life again with strength and pleasure 
long unknown to me. I would advise 
my tired sisters to try the same ex- 
periment. H. M. D. 



A Successful Refrigerator and No 

Ice-bill 

PUT a shelf in a soap-box, and open 
one side on hinges. Run two heavy 
wires under the box diagonally, and 
fasten on top. To these tie a rope. 



Over the centre of the well fasten 
a pulley to the porch roof. Cut a hole 
in the porch floor over the middle of 
the well. 

Suspend the box in the well, run the 
rope over the pulley and down through 
a hole bored in the floor. Tie on a 
weight heavy enough to balance the 
box when full. 

A piece of matting placed between 
the mattress and sheet will make the 
bed much cooler. 

The centre of an old counterpane 
makes a good silence cloth for the 
dining table. 

One bed -ridden for a year has had 
a summer's outing at a cost of only 

$3-42. 

Heavy ticking, fixed to slide on 
wires, screened the porch from the 
morning sun or rains. While another 
piece, reaching to the floor, did duty 
as portiere at the end of the porch. 

This furnished not only a refreshing 
change, but a cool place to sleep. 

A coat of aluminine, once a year, will 
keep the sides of the stove in good 
shape and save blacking. Buy it in 
bulk, at the hardware store, much 
cheaper than in labelled bottles. 

A sheet always wears out at the foot 
first. If a wide hem be made at both 
ends, so the same end will not be at 
the foot every week, the sheet will last 
much longer. 

A small sheet-iron oven, which can

be used over a single burner, is much 
more quickly heated than the oven 
of a gas stove. It is also more con- 
venient. H. W. Vaught. 



" Rose " Bowls 

A SILVER bowl is a beautiful re- 
ceptacle for roses. The metal 
serves as an effective background for 
the most universally admired of all 
the flowers in nature's garden. A 
Louis XV. design, a two-handled rose- 
bowl full of fragrant blooms, in all 
the lovely pinks, makes a lovely dec- 
oration for any room in the house. 
Those owning antique silver tea- 
sets might use the " sugar-bowl' ' for 
this purpose. 

Another rose-holder, very effective, 
is made of a' "cabbage." Use a small 
or medium-sized cabbage, with loose 
and curling leaves. Cut the heart out 
of the cabbage, and set in a cluster 
of roses. Then through every open- 
ing of the leaves insert a stem. Holes 
should be punctured in the bottom 
of the cabbage, so all the stems may 
go through into water in a flat glass 
dish that is not more than three 
inches deep. Then for a finish at its 
base, delicate greens cluster all around 
the cabbage in the water, and fall over 
the sides of the dish, concealing it 
entirely. The favorite green for this 
is a variety of ornamental asparagus, — 
the "sprengeri," for instance, or, when 
it is not possible to secure this, wood 
mosses would answer the purpose if 
arranged cleverly. This "cabbage 
rose" makes a charming centrepiece, 
also, for the "company" table.

The Question of Dessert 

WHAT a question it is, to be sure! 
How tired the housekeeper grows 
in answering it! How tired, too, the 
members of the family become of the 



"same old thing"! But, so long as 
one deals with people who like cream, 
one need never feel quite discouraged 
over this question. For dishes served 
with -or made of cream are innumera- 
ble and delicious, pleasing both eye 
and palate. 

Have you ever eaten chocolate- 
cream tarts ? I am sure you have not, 
since I originated them myself, in the 
early days of my housekeeping, when 
I was my own cook and felt tired of 
all the desserts I had ever heard of. 
I made a very nice rich pie crust, 
which I rolled as thin as possible. 
With this crust I lined my patty-tins. 
Then on the remaining crust I pressed 
the bottom of the tins. In this way 
I was enabled to cut out covers which 
would exactly fit the tarts. These 
covers I baked on a tin. When cold, 
I spread them with chocolate melted 
and slightly sweetened. Shortly be- 
fore dinner I filled the tarts, which 
had been removed from the patty-pans, 
with a rather thick, cold, boiled custard. 
The covers spread with chocolate were 
placed on top. And on each cover I 
heaped a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream. You will find these tarts de- 
licious. Of course, it is a little work 
to line the patty-pans. If you wish 
to avoid this, use instead a pie tin and 
make a chocolate-cream pie after the 
same plan. 

By using different fillings, these 
pastry cases, or tarts, may form the 
basis of many desserts. For one try 
this : Whip cream very stiff, add crushed 
macaroons, sweeten to taste, and 
flavor with vanilla or wine. Then I 
have used these cases by filling them 
with fresh sliced peaches, which have 
stood twenty minutes, mixed with 
thick unwhipped cream and sugar. 
Again, use fresh strawberries or other 
berries left whole, and placed in the 
cases with whipped cream on top. 

Shall I tell you of the experience of 
one housekeeper, when unexpected 



46 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



company arrived for dinner an hour 
before the time for serving it? This 
housekeeper had prepared no dessert: 
that left from dinner the night before 
would be sufficient for herself and hus- 
band. As soon as she could well ex- 
cuse herself from her guest, she hur- 
ried to the pantry, to see what there 
was which could easily and quickly 
be made into a dessert. 

A dish of stewed prunes and a jar 
of cream — ordered for some other pur- 
pose — met her anxious eyes. Fortu- 
nately, the prunes had been stewed a 
long time. It was therefore an easy 
matter to stone and crush them to 
a pulp. A tablespoonful of sherry 
wine was added, and enough confec- 
tioner's sugar to sweeten slightly. 
The cream was then whipped, the 
prune mixture added to it, and the 
whole heaped lightly in a handsome 
dish. This dish, planned and pre- 
pared in a few minutes and served with 
dainty wafers, was pronounced a great 
success, and the guest asked eagerly 
for the recipe. At another time the 
same plan was followed, only the pud- 
ding was moulded by adding gela- 
tine to the hot prune juice. When 
the gelatine was dissolved and the 
juice was cool, the prunes and whipped 
cream were combined with it. 

I hope these few hints will help some 
perplexed housewife and give pleasure 
as well to those who may partake of 
the easily prepared but delicious des- 
serts. Louise Elus. 



WHEN a contemplated picnic party 
makes one anxious about the 
state of the weather, it is convenient 
to possess a few infallible weather 
signs, by. means of which one can fore- 
tell rain within twenty-four hours, 
without depending on the "weather 
man," who has occasionally been found 
wanting in his prognostications. 

Simplest of all ' 'signs" is a bottle 
containing a saturated solution of 



camphor, and then a little camphor 
besides. That which does not dissolve 
will remain at the bottom of the bottle, 
if the day is to be pleasant, while an 
approaching storm is signified when 
the residue rises in the solution, mak- 
ing it cloudy instead of clear. Alcohol 
should be used in making the solution. 

A very reliable method of foretelling 
the state of the weather is found in the 
clouds. Look out on the horizon for 
the smallest bit of a cloudlet, and watch 
it carefully. If there is to be rain or 
a dull cloudy day, the little cloud will 
be seen to grow gradually larger, gath- 
ering to itself any clouds that are near 
it, until the original cloud has grown 
larger and blacker, and increased three 
or four times its first size. On the con- 
trary, if the day is to be fair, the little 
cloud will thin gradually, until it dis- 
appears altogether, small pieces of 
cloud breaking away from the first 
cloud, from time to time, until the 
whole vanishes, and leaves the blue of 
the sky in its place. 

It is in this way that sailors foretell 
pleasant weather or the contrary, and 
the method is* considered infallible. 

One should not banish the spiders 
from the piazza and garden, by sweep- 
ing away their neat little homes, builded 
with such infinite pains, such wonderful 
patience. The large striped spider, 
with his bit of a home, is one of the 
prettiest sights to be found on a sum- 
mer morning, especially if the web is 
flecked with dew. Aside from Mr. 
Spider's beauty and usefulness as a 
fly-catcher, he is a perfect little weather 
prophet, always to be depended upon. 

Whenever one sees a cobweb house 
torn by the wind and beaten by the 
rain, one can be quite sure that it is 
that most desolate of all things, an 
abandoned home; for the spider, when 
he feels the approach of a storm, never 
fails to "fold his tent," and seek shelter , 
under some overhanging trellis or under 
the leaves of a vine. These tiny creat- 



Home Ideas and Economies

ures have an instinct which would 
make the fortune of a weather prophet, 
and they are also sufficiently wise to 
44 come in out of the wet." If, upon 
consulting this little weather-vane, one 
finds the web in place, and Mr. Spider 
ready to do business with any chance 
flies so unwise as to "walk into his 
parlor," one can be quite sure that the 
day will pass without rain, however 
lowering the sky may be. 

Aside from the old superstition that 
it is unlucky to kill a spider or to de- 
stroy his home, this is another reason 
why he should be left to round out his 
existence in the natural way.

Merely roll them back, and dust under 
them. Catherine Stuart. 



The Care of Oriental Rugs 

A FEW months ago I moved into an 
apartment. Facilities for shaking 
rugs were not good. Another method 
was tried. One rug at a time was 
loosely folded, and laid in the bath- 
tub. Hot water was drawn until the 
rug was well covered, then gold-dust 
powder was shaken in quite freely. 
The rug was moved and mopped about 
in this soapy water, and an astonishing 
amount of dust loosened and rolled 
out. After it seemed clean, the dirty 
water was drawn off and fresh rinsing 
water of the same temperature added. 
The rugs were dried on the fire-escape. 
Before they were fully dry, they were 
laid in their places on the floors, and 
stretched and pulled well into shape. 

Since then, once a week, the carpet- 
sweeper is rolled over them, and they 
are then wiped with a fresh floor-cloth, 
dipped into a basin of strong hot am- 
monia water, and well wrung out. If 
the floors are well dusted and the rugs 
cared for in this way, the most delicate 
gowns may be trailed over them without 
having any fear of soiling them. 

After the first washing the labor of 
caring for the rugs is light. It is not 
even necessary to lift them from the 



The Gentle Art of Knowing How 

WE have all smiled over the little 
bride's dinner order for two: 
"Lamb chops, — two dozen, please, — 
and I can send for more if these are 
not sufficient. ,, 

Housekeeping to the uninitiated 
means "a long straight road" full of 
mishaps and tribulations. An ever-pres- 
ent help, making for success, is knowing 
how. Nothing so lightens labor, trans- 
forming it from drudgery to pleasant 
occupation, as knowledge of doing work 
the best way possible,* — a saving of time, 
money, and strength. 

In illustration, take a simple task in 
the ordinary routine, — ironing. Cor- 
rectly made starch does not stick, prop- 
erly-cared-for irons are satin smooth, 
leaving no tell-tale brown streaks. The 
immaculate ironing-board, of exactly 
the right height, an extra sleeve-board 
for shirt-waists, a soft rug to stand 
upon, lessening fatigue, soft house shoes, 
— each plays an important part, work 
progresses rapidly without vexatious in- 
terruptions, and peace reigns. 

To make her hearthstone as dainty 
"as a kitten in pattens," and to make 
it so with the minimum of effort and 
with true economy, is a magical trinity 
worthy the progressive housekeeper's 
aims. 

System, despatch, and practical 
knowledge are the "open sesame" into 
her paradise. 

The woman of average means, if she 
wishes to grow up with her children and 
be at the same time a home-maker and 
an inspiring companion to her husband, 
has undertaken one of the largest con- 
tracts on record, one that will tax her 
every power to its utmost capacity. 

From the time when, according to 
Kipling, the first woman found a nice 



4 8 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



dry cave, and said to the wild man, 
"Now wipe your feet, dear, when you 
come, and we will keep house,' ' down to 
the present day, women have been the 
natural home-makers. Unfortunately, 
however, the modern scheme of educa- 
tion, until within the last few years, has 
paid no attention to this. During the 
formative period in a girl's life she is 
under such pressure to acquire her edu- 
cation, with all modern demands, that 
she has no time to learn home duties. 
How often do we hear it said of a young 
bride, "She knows nothing of house- 
keeping, — cannot even cook a meal" ! 

We begin to realize that home-mak- 
ing is a science which demands scien- 
tific knowledge and training. As a 
fundamental basis of successful living, 
we want sure knowledge of matters 
that pertain to life, its maintenance, 
preservation, and well-being. The 
housewife has to deal with ventilation, 
sanitation, and hygiene. If she is 
scientific, she looks for three things in 
foods, — value for making strength, di- 
gestibility, attractiveness. Economy is 
not alone saving : it is correct selection. 
It pays to know how. 

In planning a meal, many house- 
keepers consider that only the main 
dishes count, and think of almonds, 
celery, olives, and subordinate dishes as 
frills, whereas they all have some fuel 
value. The time is at hand when the 
housewife will provide her table with 
intelligence. 

Ruskin tells us : ' ' Wife means weaver, 
— you must be either housewives or 
house moths, remember that. In the 
deep sense you must either weave men's 
fortunes and embroider them, or feed 
upon them and bring them to decay." 

Mrs. Wm. H. Martin. 



Pies, Hygienic and Otherwise 

THE newest pies are all made on 
the hygienic basis, the crust being 
replaced by a layer of granose flakes. 



For a more ornamental top layer a 
meringue of white of egg and sugar is 
used. 

The filling is made of any fruit, or a 
mixture of two fruits, which are stewed, 
sifted, sweetened, and thickened with 
cornstarch. The cornstarch must be 
well cooked, so that no rawness be 
manifest. This pie can be cut in the 
usual shapes, and is attractive in ap- 
pearance and appetizing. A mixture 
of prunes and apricots is novel and 
advantageous to both fruits. So also 
is the combination of peaches and 
apricots. Raisins with chopped lemon 
may be found convenient at some 
seasons. 

When fresh apples are out of season, 
and dried or evaporated apples are to 
be used, especial care is needed to 
make them attractive; that is, perfect 
cooking and some spicing or flavoring 
with lemon or orange. 

A lady of the old school, with a dash 
of French taste in her inheritance, 
makes an apple jelly from the liquid 
drained off after stewing the dried 
apples. This she reserved for the top 
of the pie. The pulp is sifted and 
sweetened and seasoned as usual, and 
baked, and then the jelly is sliced and 
laid over the top, when the pie has 
cooled. 

The Moravians of Pennsylvania make 
a German apple pie. On a rich crust 
they place tender, tart apples, which 
have been pared and cored, leaving the 
core side up. In the cavity they 
sprinkle cinnamon and heap it with 
sugar. Around the apples they pour 
cream, and bake the pie. Another 
Pennsylvania German method is to dip 
the apples, when cut in small sections, 
in melted butter. These are laid in 
accurate overlapping rows on the crust, 
and dredged with sugar and spices, 
either cinnamon alone or with a little 
allspice and nutmeg. Several times 
during the baking the pie is basted with 
the butter; and, if it seems necessary,

the rest of the spiced sugar is shaken 
on. This is a very delicious pie, and 
much enjoyed by the hardy people 
whose nerves and digestions are not 
easily upset, and to whom hygienic 
cookery is a term unknown.

Rugs for Summer Cottages 

WE want to tell the readers of the 
Boston Cooking-School Magazine 
about the beautiful and useful rugs we 
are making in our Woman's Society of 
St. John's Church, Youngstown, Ohio. 
We started our rug business quite by 
accident. Several rugs belonging to 
one of our ladies were shown at a fancy- 
work sale held by the Sewing Society. 
They were greatly admired, so much 
so that before the sale closed we had 
sold the samples and taken twenty- 
five orders for duplicates. From that 
day we have been busy most of the 
time at this work. The rugs are used 
in summer cottages and bath-rooms. 
The dark ones are good for kitchens. 
They are very easily laundered, and, 
if carefully looked after, will last, a 
long time. At first we used old mate- 
rial entirely; but our trade has grown 
so fast that now we use new calico 
for colors, buying it at wholesale. 
Then we wash and boil it to make it 
soft. For the white part we prefer 
old goods. Part-worn sheets and pil- 
low-cases are best; for, being soft, 
they work in well with the carpet chain. 
Cotton rags are used entirely. We 
tear the goods in lengthwise strips, 
one-half inch wide, sew them together 
at the ends, and' roll them in balls. 
Then they are ready for the carpet- 
weaver, who weaves the rugs in the 
same manner as the old-fashioned 
rag carpet was woven. 

We have made a great many rugs of 
all colors. They are made up in stripes, 
about two inches wide, of blue and 
white, pink and white, red and white, 



and other colors. Also beautiful ones 
are made in mixed blue and mixed 
pink, and other shades, for centres, 
with a dark shade for border. Some, 
called hit-or-miss style, are considered 
very good. These consist of small 
pieces of bright cotton goods sewn 
together and woven like old-fashioned 
rag carpets. They have bright borders, 
and look fine. Some of our customers 
prefer them to the plainer ones. The 
rugs are all woven one yard wide 
and as long as the customer desires. 
Rugs two yards long or over sell for 
one dollar and twenty-five cents per 
yard. The one yard and the one and 
one-half yard rugs sell, respectively, 
for one dollar and fifty cents and one 
dollar and ninety cents per rug. We 
are greatly pleased with the sales so 
far made. The order of one customer 
last year amounted to over seventy- 
eight dollars. We sell our rugs all 
over the country; this week a large 
order has gone to Saranac Lake, N.Y.

The Tea Stove 

THE pale green glazed-ware char- 
coal-holder, as described by Mrs. 
Davis in the April number of the Cook- 
ing-School Magazine, was to me remi- 
niscent. It recalled to mind the quaint 
tea stove (literal translation) brought 
from the Land of Dykes many years 
ago by a gentle Holland dame, mother 
of a friend of the writer. This tea 
stove, of highly polished wood, was 
circular in shape, about six inches in 
diameter and five inches in height. 
It was zinc-lined, brass-bound, and 
stood on four tiny, claw-feet of brass. 
It had a removable, flat, fancifully per- 
forated brass lid on top, on which the 
teapot stood while keeping warm. 
In one side of the stove was an open- 
ing through which was slipped a pale 
green, glazed, fire-proof dish, three- 
cornered as to shape and handled on 
one corner. This held the fire, which 



5° 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



in Holland was always made of peat, 
■or turf rather, but in America was 
perforce of charcoal. 

When this tea stove, its brass mount- 
ings glistening like gold, was crowned 
with a quaint Delft teapot, it was a 
most pictureful addition to the tea 
table. Its use could be revived with 
advantage in these days of afternoon 
and five-o'clock teas. The gentle heat 
that ascended through the perfora- 
tions was sufficient to keep the pot 
warm for laggards. 

Frances Ellison Peck. 



Economy of Light 

MINE is the old plea for a well- 
lighted kitchen, and I wish to 
^emphasize its utility. Allow me an 
illustration from life. Jennie was thor- 
oughly incompetent. MrS. Smith dis- 
charged her, and did her own house- 
work. She first cleaned the kitchen. 
The cupboard under the sink looked 
better and smelled sweeter — for a 
time; but why have a dark cupboard 
under the sink to invite dirt and dis- 
ease? 

How greasy Jennie left the cooking 
vessels! How disheartening, standing 
in that dark corner washing them! 
Possibly a flood of sunlight right .there 
would have shown Jennie the dirt, 
and given her courage to wash it away. 
Might it not have warmed her heart, 
too, moving her to handle the china 
more gently? 

The range was so placed that the 
light shone, not into the oven, but 
into the eyes, defeating the purpose 
it should have accomplished. Mrs. 
Smith almost burned the bread her- 
self. 

At night she reflected that the qual- 
ity of beef, mutton, or fowl (always 
the best), did not enable one to see 
through one's shadow while roasting 
or broiling by the light of a small 
•electric bulb in the centre of the room. 



That same shadow followed her about, 
persistently getting right where light 
was most needed. 

It may be possible to keep a dark 
and gloomy kitchen clean, and to pre- 
pare a wholesome, appetizing meal 
in such a kitchen; but at what a cost! 
Is it not safe to say that Jennie will 
give better service, if she have plenty 
of light in the right places ? 

I speak advisedly when I say, The 
easier and pleasanter your servant's 
task, the better will it be performed. 

If you could but view the situation 
from the inside, I feel certain you would 
agree with me and contrive to have 
ample light in the kitchen, and give 
some intelligent thought to the plac- 
ing of windows and artificial lights in 
this important room. E. M. Hall. 



Visiting Housekeepers 

AN occupation new as yet to New 
York, and which may ultimately 
have a material bearing on the disposi- 
tion of the servant problem, is that of the 
visiting housekeeper. A writer in the 
New York Evening Post says: " There 
are a number of these in New York 
at the present time. Several keep 
expensive advertisements in the leading 
papers and magazines, which is evi- 
dence that their business pays well. 
These visiting housekeepers have a 
clientele of women whose houses they 
visit daily or at stated intervals, tak- 
ing entire charge of the servants, the 
marketing, the bills, the household 
shopping, the linen, — in a word, the 
domestic routine. The mistress of the 
establishment places a certain weekly 
amount in the hands of the housekeeper, 
gives her general directions as to the 
style she wishes her home to maintain, 
and leaves the details to the expert." 
An outgrowth of this innovation is 
a system of bonding servants, a work 
already undertaken by a firm of New 
York "visiting housekeepers." This 



Home Ideas and Economies 



5 l 



suggestion from the Post may serve 
to extend the new departure: — 

"To become a visiting housekeeper 
on a small scale is within the capacity 
of . many women who desire to earn 
^rnoney and are not trained to other 
than domestic life. An acquaintance, 
or at least the possibility of obtaining 
good introductions in the class where 
such work is demanded, is the first 
necessity. The qualifications are, 
besides a thorough knowledge of the 
art of housekeeping, tact, energy, 
amiability, and perseverance, — just 
the qualifications needed to succeed 
in any business venture. The profes- 
sion is one where education and refine- 
ment count as capital. Practically, 
all the women who have gone into it 
have had these desirable qualities 
as a basis for their success.' ' 



Kitchen Ventilation 

THE important subject of kitchen 
ventilation is discussed by an ex- 
change. In seeking the cause for the 
proverbial crossness and ill-health of 
cooks generally, the blame is attached 
to the bad lighting, overheating, and 
poor ventilation of the kitchens in 
which they spend so much time. While 
it is probable that professional cooks 
were under consideration when this 
idea was discussed, there is no doubt 
that the defects mentioned often apply 
with equal force to the home kitchen; 
and it is possible that those who equip 
such kitchens could improve the con- 
ditions with profit to themselves and 
the occupants. The stove dealer and 
tinsmith should point out that the 
cooking apparatus ought to be placed 
where the cook will not only have a 
good light on the work, but can also 
have the diversion of a change of scene 
and the relief afforded by a near-by 
window. Such a window can be used 



with excellent advantage for the escape 
of excessive heat and for ventilation; 
and the proper location of the cooking 
apparatus should be pointed out to 
architects, builders, carpenters, and 
owners. There are, however, many 
existing buildings where these desir- 
able conditions are not found; and 
it is here that the greatest good and 
the most profit can be secured. 
In well-equipped kitchens, hoods are 
placed over the range to gather the 
steam and odors and carry them off. 
Sometimes the regular smoke flue 
cannot be used for a vent flue, and then 
a sheet-iron flue with ventilating hood 
will serve the purpose. Such equip- 
ment will exhaust the odors and carry 
off the foul air and surplus heat, and 
will lead to the need of some fresh air 
being brought into the kitchen without 
the chilling effect of opening a window 
in winter. This should be a simple 
detail, readily supplied where there 
is a constant fire, as in a cooking-stove, 
by constructing a flue to bring the fresh 
air to the stove in such a way that it 
will be heated before it is discharged 
into the kitchen. — The House Beauti- 
ful 

A rosy-cheeked old lady sat in the 
front row, watching a cooking demon- 
stration, and, when she recognized 
in the dish to be prepared next a fa- 
vorite of hers, said: "I do so like lemon 
pie for company. It looks so dressy 
for tea." 

The materials for a ham omelet had 
been placed on the table, and the eggs 
were being broken, when a voice wailed, 
"But I thought it was going to be a 
ham omelet!" Her neighbor's nudg- 
ing was of no avail; for she protested, 
"She's putting eggs into the bowl." A 
silence of suspicion, then another voice 
demanded sternly, "Is it an egg ome- 
let?"

THIS department is for (he benefit and free use of our subscribers. Questions relating to menus 
and recipes, and those pertaining to culinary science and domestic economics in general, will be 
cheerfully answered by the editor. Communications for this department must reach us before the 
first of the month preceding that in which the answers are expected to appear. In letters requesting 
answer by mail, please enclose postage stamp; for menus, Jl. Address queries to Janet M. Hill, 
Editor Boston CootingSchoel Magatint, 372 Boy Is ton Street, Boston, Mass. 



Query 880.— Mrs. F. H. H„ Sioux Falls. 
So. Dak.: "Suggest a sanitary bin for storing 
potatoes, when they are kept, in quantity 
throughout the winter, in a cellar." 

Bin for Potatoes 
A satisfactory bin for storing po- 
tatoes may be made of rough boards 
(slabs will do nicely), with an inch 
space between the boards. If a large 
quantity of potatoes is to be stored, 
the bin may run the whole length of 
the cellar wall. It should be about 
two and one-half feet from the floor, 
thus insuring ventilation from below 
and easy access to the potatoes. The 
bin might be from one to two feet in 
depth. Carpet or sacks spread over 
the potatoes will keep them from turn- 
ing yellow. 

Query 890,— J. M. G., Mount, Minn.: "Rec- 
ipe for putting up maraschino cherries." 

Maraschino Cherries 
Stone the cherries, then weigh them. 



Allow three-fourths a pound of sugar 
to each pound of stoned fruit. Add 
water to the juice, to make a cup of 
liquid for each pound of Sugar. Heat 
to the boiling-point, and skim. Put 
the cherries into fruit jars, and set on 
the rack of a steam kettle or on a rack 
in a boiler. Pour in hot water to half 
the height of the jars. Pour syrup 
into the cans, but do not fill them. 
Put on the covers, cover the kettle, 
and let cook until the fruit is thoroughly 
scalded. Then put into each jar a cup 
(less will answer) of maraschino cor- 
dial, adding syrup or hot water to fill 
the jars to overflow. Screw down the 
covers, and let cook fifteen minutes. 
Let cool in the kettle, then tighten the 
covers. If preferred, the cherries may 
be cooked in the syrup, in a saucepan, 
and then stored in jars, leaving space 
for the cordial at the last. 

Query 891.— Mrs. M. C. R., Washington, 
D.C.: "Recipe for a salad made of cheese 



Queries and Answers

balls, with a meat of English walnut on each 
side." 



Cheese-and-English Walnut Salad 

Dress heart leaves of lettuce or short 
stalks of cress, well washed and dried, 
with French dressing. Dispose in a 
Salad bowl, and above lay small balls 
of cream or Neufchatel cheese, into 
opposite sides of which halves of nut- 
meats have been pressed. In making 
the dressing, use one tablespoonful of 
vinegar to three or four of oil, and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful, each, of salt and 
paprika. Mix the salt and pepper with 
the oil, then add the vinegar, gradu- 
ally. If this quantity does not coat 
the leaves of lettuce thoroughly, mix 
more dressing, and pour over the let- 
tuce, turning the leaves over and over, 
to insure thorough seasoning. Then 
lav on the balls of cheese and nuts, and 
serve at once. 



Query 892. — Mrs. M. R. H., Owen, Wis.: 
"Recipes for caramel custard with caramel 
sauce; also muffins made of white, Graham, 
corn meal, and whole-wheat flour. Wish to 
make the Graham and whole wheat with sour 
milk." 

Caramel Custard 

Stir half a cup of granulated sugar 
in a saucepan over a hot fire, constantly, 
until the sugar melts and becomes a 
golden brown. Add about one-third 
a cup of boiling water, and let simmer 
to a thick syrup. Then add to one 
quart of scalded milk. Beat five eggs, 
add half a cup of sugar and half a 
teaspoonful of salt, and beat again. 
Then, gradually, add the hot milk, and 
• strain the mixture into a baking-dish. 
Bake, set on several folds of paper, in 
a moderate oven, until the centre 
is firm. Serve, when cold, from the 
baking-dish. The custard will be 
firm enough to serve, turned from the 
mould (when cold), if eight eggs or 
four whole eggs and eight yolks be 
used. 



Caramel Sauce 

Cook three-fourths a cup of sugar 
to caramel. Add half a cup of boiling 
water, and cook to a thick syrup. Let 
cool, and serve as a sauce with the 
custard. 

White Muffins 

Cream half a cup of butter. Beat 
in one-third a cup of sugar, then two 
beaten eggs, and, alternately, two cups 
of flour with four level teaspoonfuls of 
baking-powder and about three-fourths 
a cup of milk. Bake in a hot, well- 
buttered, iron muffin-pan about twenty- 
five minutes. 

General Rule for Muffins 

Sift together one cup, each, of flour 
and meal, or two of flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, four level teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar. Beat one egg t add about 
one cup and a fourth of milk, and stir 
into the dry ingredients with two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter. Bake 
about twenty-five minutes. These may 
be varied by the use of different varie- 
ties of meal. Corn meal and wheat 
flour, rye meal and white or entire- wheat 
flour, Graham and white or entire-wheat 
flour, are among the combinations par- 
ticularly good. A recipe for a richer 
corn-meal muffin was given in the 
December number, 1903. 

Muffins with Sour Milk 

Sift together one cup of corn meal, 
one cup of Graham flour, half a cup of 
entire-wheat flour, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of soda, and 
one-fourth a cup of sugar. Mix to a 
batter with one cup, each, of thick 
sour cream and milk. If no sour cream 
be at hand, use one cup and three- 
fourths of thick sour milk and one- 
fourth a cup of melted butter. Let 
the teaspoonful of soda be generous, 
but not exceed one teaspoonful and

muffin-pan thirty or thirty-five minutes. 



QuBry 893.— Mrs. F. M., St. John, N.B.: 
"Kindly give your opinion of vegetarianism 
and its effect upon health." 

Vegetarianism, its Effect on Health 
Vegetarianism can be called neither 
scientific nor practical. Man's diges- 
tive organs demand both vegetable 
and animal food, though existence 
(without regard to perfect develop- 
ment, physical or mental) can be main- 
tained for long periods of time on food 
that is unsuitable. All food compounds 
that are found in the animal kingdom 
are also found in the vegetable king- 
dom; but the human organs cannot 
assimilate the vegetable compounds 
with as much ease or so thoroughly as 
they can the animal compounds. And, 
if these be restricted to vegetable com- 
pounds, mal-nutrition follows. While 
the general health of some vegetarians 
may appear good, bodily powers can- 
not be sustained for any length of time 
upon a purely vegetable diet. To 
change from a mixed to a one-sided 
diet necessitates years of gradual adap- 
tation of digestive ferments and organs 
to the new diet. This gradual adapta- 
tion of system to diet could be secured, 
in time, more completely by some than 
by others; but, at best, it would take 
many generations to bring about such 
a change in the human system. With- 
out doubt many of us eat too much 
animal food, but vegetarianism is not 
the remedy. 

Qubry 894.— Mrs. G. W. Q., Tacoma, 
Wash.: "Recipes for drop molasses cookies, 
containing nuts, and barberry-and-sweet apple 
preserve." 

Drop Molasses Cookies with Nuts 
Melt one-third a cup of butter in 
one-third a cup of boiling water. Add 
one cup of molasses and two and three- 
fourths cups of flour, sifted with one 



teaspoonful of soda, half a tablespoonf ul 
of ginger, half a teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, and one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt. When thoroughly mixed, stir in 
one cup of nut-meats (walnuts or pecan 
nuts preferred) , broken in pieces. Drop 
from a spoon onto a buttered sheet. 
Press half a nut-meat into the top of 
each cake, and bake in a moderate 
oven. If the cakes spread too much, 
in baking, add more flour. Use a 
rounding teaspoonful of dough in each 
cake. 

Barberry-and-Sweet Apple Preserve 

Simmer a quart of barberries in two 
quarts of water about an hour, then 
drain in a bag. Use this water in 
cooking ten pounds of sweet apples, 
pared, quartered, and cored. Remove 
the apples from the liquid as they be- 
come tender, and add more water as 
needed. When all are cooked, add 
about five pounds of sugar to the water 
in which the fruit was cooked, let boil, 
and then skim, put in the apples, and 
cook until they look clear. Store as 
canned fruit. 

• 

Qubry 895. — W. F. S., Boston, Mass.: 
"What causes pie crust that is very crisp, when 
taken from the oven, to become soft when 
cool? Noticed it last in the case of cranberry 
and mince pies." 

Soft Pie Crust 

Should think neither of the reasons 
given would cause the change in the 
crust. Is there sufficient vent in the 
top crust for the steam to escape? 
Possibly the crust may not be baked 
enough. 



Qubry 896. — D. K. B., Birmingham, Eng- 
land : "Recipe for sauerkraut." 

Sauerkraut 

Select large, solid heads of white 
cabbage. Remove the coarse outside 
leaves, put a layer of these leaves in 
the bottom of a keg or barrel, and also

a row against the side. If a stone 
crock be used, it will not need lining. 
Shred the cabbage heads evenly and 
very fine. Put into the receptacle 
a layer of the shredded cabbage three 
or four inches in depth, sprinkle over 
this about one-fourth a pound (half 
a cup) of common salt, and with a 
pestle pound into the cabbage. Con- 
tinue these layers of cabbage and salt, 
until the vessel is full. Over the top 
put a board smaller than the top of 
the keg, and on this a heavy weight. 
Let stand in a warm place, to ferment. 
As fermentation goes on, the cabbage 
shrinks and settles. Remove the scum 
from the liquid, exchange the small 
cover for one that fits over the 
vessel and store in a cool, dry place. 
In two weeks the sauerkraut will be 
ready for use.

Query 899. — Mrs. A. E. K. ( Montgomery, 
Ala.: "How 000k kidneys, to insure tender- 
ness. What kidneys are best? " 

Cooking Kidneys 

Kidneys are tender after five min- 
utes' cooking. If cooked longer, it must 
be for several hours. The kidneys 
from young creatures will cook tender 
more quickly than those from older 
ones, but they need cooking several 
hours. On account of their firm, close 
texture, they are not easily digested. 
As these organs are liable, from their 
peculiar office, to become diseased, 
they are more wholesome when cooked 
thoroughly. Cooked several hours, 
any disease germs would be rendered 
immune. 



Query 900. — Mrs. E. A. F., Michigan: 
"What kind of cherries are used for mara- 
schino cherries, and how are they put up? 
How can sweet red peppers for salads, and 
what kind of peppers are used?" 

Maraschino Cherries 

We think that a sweet white cherry 
would be used for the purpose desig- 
nated. When completed, these cher- 
ries vary in color. Sometimes they 
are light red. Often dark red, and, 
occasionally, light green are seen. A 
recipe for putting up these cherries 
will be found in answer to Query No. 890. 
After reading the following clipping 
from "What to Eat," we might con- 
clude that it were better to "put up" 
this exceedingly pretty confection, 
even if we do not succeed in securing 
the exact tint of the manufactured 
product. 

"The Cherry in the Cocktail 

"Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, chief of 

the bureau of chemistry of the United 

States Department of Agriculture, tells 

the College Club of Philadelphia, which 



is made up of alumnae from women's 
colleges, that cocktails and coffee, jams 
and jellies, salad oil and sausages, but- 
ter and beans, are subject to bare- 
faced adulterations. Dr. Wiley intro- 
duced the cocktail subject with an 
apology, stating to the ladies that he 
knew nothing about it, but that it was 
the cherry, which adds the finishing 
touch, that he objected to. He declared 
that this cherry was only the skin and 
cellular structure of what was once 
a luscious fruit, after it has been 
bleached with sulphur, soaked in brine, 
filled with glucose, and flavored with 
prussic acid." 

Canned Sweet Red Peppers 

The sweet red peppers commonly 
used in salads are imported Spanish 
pimentoes. Two cans are usually sold 
for about twenty-five cents. There 
are ten peppers in a can. There 
are no peppers, at least in our 
Eastern and Northern markets, that 
correspond to these. There is, how- 
ever, no reason why they might not 
be raised somewhere in this country. 
Almost any variety of sweet red pepper 
might be canned, just as any vegetable 
is canned, and used for this purpose. 
To prepare, cut out the stem end, 
and remove the partitions and seeds. 
Scald, then rub off the outer skin, and 
cook until just tender in boiling salted 
water. Put the peppers into jars, 
then fill to overflow with the water in 
which they were cooked. Close the 
jars as usual.

the following recipe? It crumbles and sticks to 
the mould in which it is steamed. Three and

also, two well-beaten eggs. 

Fried Pies 

Wash the dried apples, after letting 
them stand over night in cold water. 
Stew until tender in just enough water 
to barely cover. Press through a sieve, 
then season to taste with sugar, spice, 
and salt. Reduce to a thick consistency 
by cooking, if necessary. Cut rounds 
from pastry rolled out as for pie crust. 
Put a spoonful of the prepared apple 
on one-half the paste, and brush the 
edge of the other half with cold water. 
Turn the paste over the apple, and press 
down closely upon the edge. Brush 
over both sides with beaten egg (yolk 
alone may be used), and fry in deep 
fat five or six minutes, or until the 
crust is cooked. 



It is a great satisfaction, when invited 
to partake of table condiments and

"I made these myself." — Boston Her-

Strawberry Jam 

The newspapers report that the State 
chemist of Nebraska has analyzed a 
sample of commercial strawberry jam, 
and found that it was no such thing. 
It was made chiefly of pumpkin, tinted 
with coal-tar dyes, preserved in ben- 
zoin, and the seeds that were intended 
as evidence of the presence of real 
berries were grass seeds. This does 
not account for the flavor; but every- 
body knows that flavors may be arti- 
ficially simulated by chemical processes. 
Confident reliance on the manufacturer 
and the shopkeeper has induced house- 
wives to forego the trouble of making 
their own jam and preserves. We 
mean housewives who know how to 
do it, — a kind that is diminishing, 
because the art is not regarded as a 
necessary accomplishment in modern 
days. The factory-prepared article is 
often cheaper, as well as more con- 
veniently obtained. When it is com- 
pounded as this alleged strawberry 
jam was, why shouldn't it be cheaper? 



What the King Eats 

What's Fit for Him 

A Massachusetts lady who has been 
through the mill with the trials of the 
usual housekeeper and mother relates 
an interesting incident that occurred 
not long ago. She says: — 

"I can with all truthfulness sav that 
Grape-nuts is the most beneficial of all 
cereal foods in my family, young as 
well as old. It is food and medicine 
both to us. A few mornings ago at 
breakfast my little boy said, — 

11 'Mamma, does the king eat Grape- 
nuts every morning ?' 

"I smiled, and told him I did not 
know, but that I thought Grape-nuts 
certainly made a delicious dish, fit for 
a king/' (It's a fact that the King of 
England and the German Emperor 
both eat Grape-nuts.) 

"I find that by the constant use of 
Grape-nuts not only as a morning 
cereal, but also in puddings, salads, etc., 
made after the delicious recipes found 
in the little book in each package, it is 
proving to be a great nerve food for 
me, besides having completely cured a 
long standing case of indigestion.' ' 
Name given by Postum Company, 
Battle Creek, Mich. 

There is no doubt Grape-nuts is the 
most scientific food in the world. 

Ten days' trial of this proper food in 
place of improper food will show in 
steady, stronger nerves, sharper brain, 
and the power to "go" longer and fur- 
ther and accomplish more. There's a 
reason.

little book, "The Road to Wellville""

Wedding Cake

banquet, tall and graceful and exquis- 
ite, combining the arms of England 
and Denmark. Each tier was encircled 
with white satin ribbons, bordered with 
pearls, and ornamented with bridal 
buds and true lovers' knots, and sur- 
mounted by the god of love holding a 
nautilus shell, from which fell in long 
lines silver bullion and sea mosses. 
The shell held roses and starry bridal 
flowers; and around the base, richly 
emblazoned with the royal arms, was 
a wreath of the same flowers. Even 
a fairy princess could ask for no more 
charming and superb cake than this. 
For each succeeding royal marriage 
an appropriate design is made for the 
majestic cake, with heraldic devices 
and fitting emblems. 



Fruit Cake (C. F. L., Washington) 

Cut two pounds of citron in large 
pieces. Use two pounds of candied 
cherries, whole. Cut two pounds, each, 
of candied apricots and pineapple into 
pieces. Put the fruit in a large pan, 
sift over it half a pound of flour, and 
mix the flour thoroughly through the 
pieces of fruit. Cream one pound of 
butter. Beat into it one pound of 
sugar. When very light and creamy, 
add the beaten yolks of twelve eggs. 
Sift a second half-pound of flour with 
one teaspoonful (rounding) of baking- 
powder, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, 
one teaspoonful of clove, and two nut- 
megs, grated. Add this to the fruit 
mixture, alternately, with the whites 
of twelve eggs, beaten dry. Add also 
one cup of brandy or whiskey, and mix 
very thoroughly. Steam five hours, 
then bake in a very slow oven one hour. 
This latter is only to dry the cake a 
little. Make in loaves, to si^it con- 
venience. Tins with tube in the centre 
are a good shape. This is a most de- 
licious fruit cake. 



Her Opinion 

"What do you think of the new 
Japanese ultimatum?" asked the young 
man who was trying to make conver- 
sation. 

"Very nice," answered Mrs. Cumrox, 
"although, to tell you the truth, I like 
plain old-fashioned fruits the best. ,,

Clever Doctor 

Cured a Twenty Years* Trouble without Any 

Medicine 

A wise Indiana physician cured 
twenty years' stomach disease without 
any medicine, as his patient tells : — 

"I had stomach trouble for twentv 
years, tried allopathic medicines, pat- 
ent medicines, and all the simple 
remedies suggested by my friends, but 
grew worse all the time. 

"Finally, a doctor who is the most 
prominent physician in this part of 
the State told me medicine would 
do me no good, only irritating my 
stomach and making it worse, — that 
I must look to diet, and quit drinking 
coffee. 

"I cried out in alarm: 'Quit drinking 
coffee! Why, what will I drink?' 

" 'Try Postum,' said the doctor. 'I 
drink it, and you will like it when it is 
made according to directions, with 
cream; for it is delicious, and has none 
of the bad effects coffee has.' 

"Well, that was two years ago, and 
I am still drinking Postum. My stom- 
ach is right again, and I know doctor 
hit the nail on the head when he de- 
cided coffee was the cause of all my 
trouble. I only wish I had quit it 
years ago, and drank Postum in its 
place." Name given by Postum Com- 
pany, Battle Creek, Mich. 

Never too late to mend. Ten days' 
trial of Postum in place of coffee works 
wonders. There's a reason.

Institution Recipes. By EmmaSined- 
ley. Cloth. 120 pp. Price $1.00. 
Philadelphia: William F. Fell Com- 
pany. 

This manual is the outcome of work 
done in the Preparatory Department 
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Training 
School. It supplies a collection of 
recipes for use in schools, hospitals, 
and other institutions. It is the re- 
sult of laboratory experiments and 
practical application in the prepara- 
tion of food by groups of students, 
under the direct supervision of trained 
and expert instructors. The quantities 
given in the recipes will serve, with 
few exceptions, one hundred and fifty 
persons. There is a growing demand 
everywhere for recipes of this character. 

Practical Cook-rook. By Henriette 
Davidis. Price in English or Ger- 
man, each, $1.25. Milwaukee: C. N. 
Caspar Company. 

This cook-book is recognized in Ger- 
many as the standard authority in all 
matters pertaining to the culinary art. 
Its popularity is evidenced by the fact 
that thirty-five editions have been 
printed. 

This is the second American edition. 
The German weights and measures 
have been changed to conform to those 
in vogue in this country. In an ap- 
pendix are contained a number of 
recipes for the preparation of a variety 
of dishes specifically American in char- 
acter. The edition has also been aug- 
mented by the addition of an English- 
German vocabulary of culinary terms. 



Thus the book becomes of great in- 
terest and value to all those who wish 
to look into the subject of cookery as 
it is practised in a foreign land. 

The Singular Miss Smith. By Flor-

Illustrated. Price $1.50. NewYork: 
The Mac mi II an Company. 
A young woman, Anne Smith, edu- 
cated, rich, and independent, finds her- 
self out of sympathy' with certain 
phases of modern life, and especially 
with the ideas advanced in one woman's 
club. She resolves to don the garb and 
act the part of a domestic, in order to 
realize more fully how the other half 
lives'. Miss Smith has the knack of 
jotting down in her notebook the 
thoughts and inferences that are drawn 
from the vicissitudes of her strange 
and varied experience; and it is this 
experience, rich and instructive, that 
constitutes the striking feature of the 
book. Of course there is a love-story

woven into the fabric of the narrative; 
but it is wholesome and sensible, 
and runs on to a satisfactory conclu- 
sion. 

The book is decidedly readable: it is, 
also, seasonable and enlightening. The 
subject is of interest and concern to 
every thoughtful woman, and men will 
find its perusal no less entertaining and 
agreeable. 

After a day of struggle and strange 
experience in the household of a typical 
American woman, who has her own 
ideas of what a maid-of- all -work should 
be, at eleven o'clock at night Miss 
Smith inscribes the following sentences 
in her note-book: "Why does the Amer- 
ican woman of the laboring class de- 
cline to enter domestic service? Can 
the answer to this question be sought 
in the person of the American mis- 
tress?" 

Mrs. Kingsley has written a book 
that women should read; but, we re- 
peat, men may enjoy the perusal of her 
story even more than women. 

Food Value of Meat. By W. R. C. 
Latson, M.D. Cloth. Price 50 
cents. New York: The Health- 
Culture Company. 

The papers that make up the con- 
tents of this little volume contain a 
brief discussion of the food question, — 
a subject upon which health, happiness, 
and longevity depend. The province 
of the book is "to show that the con- 
ventional diet of the civilized world is 
defective in some important particulars, 
and to suggest an improved dietary, 
based upon the demonstrable princi- 
ples of chemistry and physiology." 
The author has made a thorough 
study of his subject from a scientific 
point of view. And he writes intel- 
ligently about matters that are of 
most vital concern to every human 
being. 

Anna the Adventuress. By E. Phil- 
lips Oppenheim. Illustrated. 320 



pp. izmo. $1.50. Boston: Little, 

Brown & Co. 

In his new story of London life Mr. 
Oppenheim takes for heroines two sis- 
ters, Anna and Annabel, who look 
almost exactly alike. Annabel "got 
herself talked about" when the sisters 
were living in Paris, and then calmly 
married Sir John Ferringhall, a pro- 
spective M.P., although that astute 
Britisher thought he was marrying the 
other, Anna. The complications that 
follow would test the skill and ingenuity 
of any novelist. 

The subtle study of character, as 
shown in the two sisters, is masterly. 
The subordinate characters are deline- 
ated with almost as much ability. But 
it is for his power of telling a story that 
the author first made a name, and in 
none of his novels is this power more 
manifest. From beginning to end it 
goes on increasing in interest as 
it progresses, and sparkles with bril- 
liant] conversation and unusual situa- 
tions. 

From beginning to end this is an en- 
tertaining story, indeed. It has all the 
characteristics of the modern style of 
romance, — wit, humor, naturalness, 
Bohemianism, and dramatic incident. 
The characters might be called a little 
fast; but, then, it is English high life 
that is depicted, and the volume will 
not lack readers.

Mellin's Food 



I send you bjr this mail the photograph of the son of Capt. Tomioka of the Imperial Japanese 
Navy, whose life was saved by Mellin'a Food. When he was only 14 days old his life was 
despaired of, for his mother was so ill she had no milk for him and he could not digest cow's 
milk. I persuaded the parents to give him Mellin'a Pood and it acted like a charm. This photo- 
graph was taken when he was 8 months old. He is now a fine boy, happy all day long and 
weighs nearly 10 lbs. (which is very unusual for a Japanese baby of hia age). Mellin's Food 
proved so helpful for this baby that quite a number of naval officers here have fed their babies 
with the greatest success.

An Ingenious Pantry 



IT is difficult for the city housekeeper 
to imagine perfect comfort without 
an elaborate refrigerator and a daily 
call from the iceman ; yet in charming 
Bayfield, on Lake Superior, is a family 
who have dispensed with both, and 
yet satisfy all the demands of the bon 
vivant. In this well-appointed home 
there is a large pantry on the north 
side of the house. Such absolute 
spotlessness as reigns there is only 
attainable away from the dust-raising 
bustle of the world's congested places. 
On the ample shelves are those mul- 
titudinous kitchen accessories which 
we of the gas range and adjacent deli- 
catessen have had eliminated from our 
housewifely possessions; and a large 
window with crisp muslin curtains 
lights every nook and corner. 

From the lowest visible shelf to the 
floor are doors enclosing other shelves; 
and here is the pike de resistance of 
the pantry, for on opening the doors 
you discover that the flooring has been 
cut away, and replaced by heavy wire 
screening. Below, in the cellar, a long 
window opens to the north directly 
on a bed of nasturtiums and sweet- 
peas; and the flood of cool, perfume- 
laden air forms a current through the 
screening, the loosely fitted doors, and 
the upper window. 



On the shelves the delicious butter, 
just from the churn ; the huge pans of 
milk "setting" for the cream skimming; 
baskets of grapes and shiny red apples; 
meats for to-morrow's luncheon or 
tempting salads for the evening, — are 
all kept cool, crisp, and appetizing with 
that freshness of nature's providing. 

Of course, they are not reduced to 
the low temperature of refrigerator- 
guarded food ; but they have about 
them that indefinable something wheh 
makes you linger in the dining-room 
with satisfaction, and connect the un- 
poetic refreshment of the inner man 
with dewdrops glistening on the morn- 
ing-glories, and the tinkle of bells as 
the cows come down from the woods 
at even -time. 

One cannot think of this house 
without taking in the kitchen; for it is 
such a paradise of a domestic work- 
shop, and one of its chief attractions 
is a number of shelves. They are 
not shelves in the ordinary accep- 
tation of the term, but shelves like 
the leaves of old-fashioned tables, 
which can be put up and held in posi- 
tion by a swinging bracket, or dropped 
flat against the wall when not in use, 
just as the table leaf is put down. 

Neatly covered with white oilcloth, 
they form an indispensable adjunct

Never Eat unless Hungry 

A prolific cause of chronic indiges- 
tion is eating from habit, and simply 
because it is meal-time and others are 
eating. To eat when not hungry is 
to eat without relish, and food taken 
without relish is worse than wasted. 
Without relish the salivary glands 
do not act, the gastric fluids are not 
freely secreted, and the best of foods 
will not be digested. Many perfectly 
harmless dishes are severely con- 
demned for no other reason than they 
were eaten perfunctorily and without 
relish and due insalivation. 

Hunger makes the plainest foods 
enjoyable. It causes vigorous secre- 
tion and outpouring of all the digestive 
fluids, — the sources of ptyalin, pepsin, 
trypsin, etc., without a plentiful supply 
of which no foods can be perfectly 
digested. 

Wait for an appetite, if it takes a 
week. Fasting is one of the saving 
graces. It has a spiritual significance 
only through its great physical and 
physiologic importance. If breakfast 
is a bore or lunch a matter of indiffer- 
ence, cut one or both of them out. 
Wait for distinct and unmistakable 
hunger, and then eat slowly. If you 
do this, you need ask few questions as 
to the propriety and digestibility of 
what you eat; and it need not be pre- 
digested ! — Hygienic Gazette. 



"How long shall I boil the eggs,

housewife, "but cook them until they

Proverbs about Rain 
Unusual clearness in the atmosphere. 
objects being seen very distinctly, 
indicates rain. 

Evening gray and morning red, 
Put on your hat, or you will wet your 
head. 
A piece of kelp or seaweed hung up 
will become damp previous to rain. 

When rain comes from the west, it 
will not continue long. 
Rain from the south prevents the 

drouth, 
But rain from the west is always best. 
When the walls are more than usually 
damp, rain may be expected. 

Doors and windows are hard to shut 
in damp weather. 

A lump of hemp acts as a good hy- 
grometer; and, when it is damp, it 
prognosticates rain. 

If corns, wounds, and sores itch or 
ache more than usual, rain is to fall 
shortly. 
A coming storm your shooting corns 

presage, 
And aches will throb, your hollow 
tooth will rage. 
When rheumatic people complain of 
more than ordinary pains in the joints, 
it will rain. 

Tulips and dandelions close up before 
rain. 

Rain long foretold, long last ; 
Short notice, soon past. 
If it rains when the sun shines, it 
will rain the next day. 
Trees grow dark before a storm. 
When the leaves of trees curl, with 
the wind from the south, it indicates 
rain. 

If it rains before sunrise, expect a 
fair afternoon. 

If it rains before seven, 
It will cease before eleven.

The National Pure Food Bill 

Recently United States Senator 
Hepburn, after waiting with much 
patience for many days, found oppor- 
tunity to speak to the Senate on the 
subject of pure food. Technically, the 
speech was in support of a resolution 
calling on the Secretary of Agriculture 
to send to the Senate the results of the 
investigations made by his department 
into adulterated foods, but in reality it 
was in support of the pure food bill. 
Mr. Hepburn contended that a very 
large proportion of foods, drugs, and 
liquors were adulterated, and that 
many drugs were absolutely poisonous. 

Mr. Hepburn advocated the Mc- 
Cumber bill in place of the Hepburn 
bill. He said that the measure was 
being opposed from various interested 
sources. The physicians of the coun- 
try want legislation, he said, because 
under existing conditions they cannot 
have their prescriptions filled as they 
wish. Out of 14 samples of drugs ad- 
vertised, 13 were found to be rank 
frauds. More than 50 per cent, of the 
patent medicines, Mr. Hepburn said, 
were deleterious to health, while a large 
per cent, were absolutely poisonous. 
There was, Mr. Hepburn said, very 
determined opposition on the part of 
newspapers, which advertise the nos- 
trums, and he had been approached by 
men representing influential journals 
asking him to strike out the provision 
relating to patent medicines. One of 
these men had told him that the pas- 
sage of the bill in its present form

would injure his business to the extent 
of $40,000 aj year.% Mr. Hepburn said 
that more than half the foods are in- 
juriously adulterated and more than 
half of the remaining half misbranded. 
The whiskey men oppose the bill, he 
said, because it compels them to tell 
the character of their liquor. Mr. 
Hepburn also referred to the practice 
of keeping meats in cold storage, saying 
that they were often held for years, 
while after three months they were 
absolutely deleterious. — New England

Olive OiJ 

Many importers and distributors of 
olive oil lay great stress on the fact 
that the particular brand of olive oil 
they offer the public is "pure olive 
oil." This, conceding the statement 
to be a fact, is very praiseworthy, 
especially regarding olive oil, which is 
capable of so much adulteration; but 
did you ever stop to consider just how 
far the statement that an olive oil 
was "pure" olive oil goes, and what 
further could be said in praise of this 
article ? 

Pure olive oil is pressed from olives 
solely, without the admixture of any- 
thing else; and, when pressed solely 
from olives, it is within the statement 
made, in that it is "pure" olive oil. 
But who ever heard of any one consum- 
ing olive oil direct fio:n the press? 
It is therefore not alone sufficient that 
an olive oil should be "pure" olive 
oil: it must be clarified, refined, and 
treated so that the acids contained in 
it, when freshly pressed, shall be 
extracted. An olive oil should not only 
be "pure," but it must also be limpid,

Vacation Resorts in New England 

After the severe and protracted siege 
of winter weather, thousands of vaca- 
tionists are, perhaps, planning, at any 
rate thinking of their haunts for 1904. 
The farm houses are prepared for com- 
pany after the middle of May, the 
shore resorts get ready in June, and 
by the last of June or the first of July 
the mountains are welcoming their 
guests. Maine has both coast and in- 
land lake resorts of supreme beauty. 
New Hampshire has a short but scenic 
section of seacoast; but the famous 
White {Mountains and Lakes Winne- 
pesaukee and Sunapee are within her 
borders. Vermont claims the renowned 
Champlain, Memphremagog, and Wil- 
loughby; and Massachusetts asks no 
favors with her pleasant valleys and 
impressive mountain ranges. 

All of this vacation territory is de- 
scribed and pictured in the literature

A Welcome Addition to the Toilet 
Table 

Where one's person is concerned, 
there is no odor so desirable as that 
indescribable odor of perfect cleanli- 
ness. 

Every woman of refinement knows 
this, and realizes that it is by no means 
the least of her charms. 

By a peculiar decree of nature, how- 
ever, that very odor of cleanliness 
is in many cases most difficult of at- 
tainment, owing to the fact that the 
unpleasant odor of perspiration per- 
meates the clothing and clings to the 
body in spite of the most rigorous 
bathing. 

To cover this up with some strong 
perfume is admittedly vulgar, and 
every woman will welcome a prepa- 
ration that makes such a course as 
unnecessary as it is undesirable. 

Such a preparation is Puritan Toilet 
Powder, a harmless and hygienic de- 
odorizer which entirely destroys all 
offensive odor. Detailed information 
will be found in the advertising columns 
of this magazine. 

No one grows tired of the flavor of 
Bayle's Horseradish Mustard, because 
of the ingenious combination of the 
ingredients. It seems to create a 
demand for itself wherever it is intro- 
duced. Many tables are never without

A woman in Brooklyn, who is active 
in promoting the suffrage cause in that 
city, tried recently to induce, a lively 
young matron to join the Women's 
Republican League. She met with a 
flat refusal. "But your husband is 
a Republican, and you belong to the 
Woman Suffrage Association." "I be- 
long to the Suffrage Association and to 
the Anti-suffrage Association," was the 
placid reply. "I like the women in 
one and the refreshments in the other."

SINS OF OMISSION 

It is not the wrong I have done to-day 

That robs me of my rest: 
"1 is that through selfish love of ease 

1 have failed to do my best. 

It is not for shame of some hasty speech. 

This flush upon my cheek : 
*Tis for the brave and honest words 

My lips refused to speak. 

It is not to be freed from some deadly sin 

I pray to God to-night. 
But for the eyes to see and for 

The will to do the right.

Sarah Alden Ripley, Colonial Dame of 
One Hundred Years Ago 



By E. D. H. 



THE adult mind holds to the 
child's liking for pictures, and 
draws inspiration from them. 
The preacher may cry himself hoarse 
against the growing love for worldly 
gain, and all to little avail. But let 
him who has the skill to use language 
gracefully, and at the same time the 
tact to avoid moral deduction, picture 
scenes from the lives of those whose 
lofty aims have not only developed 
great personalities, but also made in- 
calculable and ever- widening impres- 
sions on others. 

Of such nature was the life of Sarah 
Alden Ripley. She was bom in Boston, 
July 31, 1793, the eldest of the seven 
children of Captain Gamaliel Bradford. 
This father must have been little af- 
fected by the prejudices of his day; 
for, when his daughter timidly asked 
him if she might study Latin, he 
laughed, and said: "A girl study Latin? 
Yes, study Latin, if you want to. You 
may study anything you please." This 
encouragement, and a few years of 
study with Mr. Cummings, an excep- 
tional schoolmaster, laid the founda- 
tion of remarkable learning. Senator 
Hoar says: "She was one of the most 
wonderful scholars of her time, or in- 
deed of any time. President Everett 



said she could nil any professor's chair 
at Harvard. She was an admirable 
mathematician. She read the "Me- 
canique Cfleste" of Laplace in the orig- 
inal without the aid of Dr. Bowditch's 
translation. She was a fine German 
and Italian scholar. She had a great 
fondness for Greek literature, especially 
for Plato and jEschylus. She was an 
accomplished naturalist." 

When a very little girl, on one of 
her many visits to her grandparents at 
Duxbury, she met Abba Allyn, the 
minister's daughter, who became a life- 



The famed Concord Bridge

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



long friend. Together they played in 
the woods, picking flowers and wonder- 
ing at the mysteries of nature. When 
separated, they exchanged letters, 
which now seem quaint and old- 
fashioned. 

From Sarak to Abba, 

Be assured I wish to conceal nothing from 
you, and if I were in affliction your participa- 
tion would greatly lessen it. Write to me the 
manner in which you employ your time. Your 
papa informed me you had become an adept 
in spinning. Have you begun Virgil ? I must 
bid you goodby, my dearest and best friend, 
and it is my earnest desire that you may be 
happy in this world and that which is to 



I have been so busily engaged, since mother 
has been at Duxbury, in mending old clothes 
and making cambric bonnets, that I have not 
had time to read, write, nor scarcely think, 
except about my work. What will you say, — 
that I have improved or degenerated, if I tell 
you I have spent almost a fortnight in making 
two bonnets,? I am afraid, if you knew how 
much anxiety and fretting they have occa- 
sioned, you would be at no loss in pronouncing 
judgment. Be that as it may, I have acquired 
the fame of being quite a tasteful milliner, 



and, if you regard the time and pains bestowed , 
I think there was never any fame of the kind 
more justly earned. . . . You don't want to 
know what I am doing, but I will tell you, 
to plague you. I study now and then a little 
Latin. In the daytime, while I sit at work, 
Daniel reads some entertaining book to me, 
and in the evening, when there is no company, 
I usually study a chapter in the Greek Testa- 
ment, f am sometimes almost tempted to 
wish I knew nothing about Latin, and had not 
a taste for studies that subject me to so many 
inconveniences; for the time I now employ 
in study I should then spend in reading books 
which would enable me to join in the conver- 
sation and partake of the pleasures of fash- 
ionable ladies, but now I am as careful to 
conceal my books and as much afraid of being 
detected with them as if I were committing 
some great crime. . . . My mother is very 
sick to-day, and I have cake in the oven to 
take care of: so goodby. 

Mrs. Bradford's long illness and early 
death left the burden of home cares to 
Sarah, who bore them uncomplainingly. 
She was not only the mother of her 
younger brothers and sisters, but their 
teacher as well, thus fitting herself, all 
unknowingly, for future duties. When- 
ever she alludes to these children in

woman of great genius and the aunt of 
Ralph Waldo Emerson. It was Miss 
Emerson's half-brother, Dr. Samuel 
Ripley, whom Miss Sarah Bradford 
married, when she was twenty-five 
years old. Then followed for twenty- 
eight years a life of care, responsibility, 
hard physical and mental labor, such 
as it is difficult to believe possible. 
For her marriage made her the wife of 
a clergyman, the matron and principal 
teacher of a boarding-school for boys 
fitting for Harvard College, the mother 
of seven children, and the hostess in 
a home where distinguished and learned 
people were entertained frequently. 

It makes the brain whirl to follow 
her through the varied duties of the 
day. She writes: — 

We are busily engaged preparing for com- 
mencement. Oh, the misery of correcting 
Latin in which there is no indictable mistake 
and yet all is wrong ab initio. . . . Another Sat- 



can be called leisure to rise at half-past six, 
wash three babies before breakfast, look after 
the tidiness of fifteen boys, and walk half a 
mile to meeting under the burning sua. . . . 
To-morrow evening Mr. Emerson lectures at 
the Rumford. He has promised to bring a 
lecture "which has legs." But I fear, after 
all, wings will be sprouting out at the heels. . . 
Sunday morning the sun looked out on the 
fields bright and warm as June. I rose at 
five, took an apple in my hand, and C.'s vol- 
ume of Beethoven under my arm. I took the 
road to Prospect, sat down on a rock at the 
foot, and was reading my book, when I heard 
a rustling among the fallen leaves, and, turn- 
ing around, a fawn laid his "innocent nose" 
in my lap. . . . Charles whets his logic weapons 
and tries their temper on me. He takes the 
side of the 'Utile" of the "Honestum." The 
other morning I was picking to pieces an old 
mattress in the barn, and was making a most

splendid microscope mounted like a telescope,

It is a delightful summer day, the lawn cov-

alone. We looked out for George, Charles, 
and Gore till bedtime, but in vain: we must 
eat our cherries, which the girls picked amidst 
the wet leaves, without them. The great 
cherry-pie, too, on which 1 expended my 
strength and sugar, they will not taste, — that

cherries and plenty of wit. ... 1 once thought 
a solitary life the true one, and, contrary to 
my theory, was moved to give up the inde- 
pendence of an attic covered with books for 
the responsibilities and perplexities of a parish 
and a family. Yet I have never regretted the 
change. Though I have suffered much, yet 
I have enjoyed much and learned more. The 
affections as they multiply spread out in rays 
to the circumference, but the soul returns, 
not driven back by desertion, but willingly, 
to its true centre, the God within. 

In 1846 the Ripleys went to Concord 



tance from his mother. He and his 
family realized the hopes and plans of 
many years when they went there to 
reside. They no longer had the care 
of school or parish, but Mrs. Ripley 
received a few private scholars. These 
last years were saddened by the death 
of Dr. Ripley and several of her children, 
brightened by the loving attention of 
family and friends and by the advent 
and frequent visits of grand- children. 
Her oldest daughter relieving her of all 
care of the house, she spent much 
time among flowers, vegetables, and 
fruit. At seventy she began the study 
of Spanish, and succeeded in reading 
several Spanish books in the original. 

Several years after her death, which 
occurred in 1867, Mrs. Ripley's letters 
and the recollections of many of her 
friends were procured and arranged for 
publication by Miss Elizabeth Hoar. 
Each added page of this interesting 
collection reveals Mrs. Ripley as 
the tender, affectionate woman, whose 
scholarship was unapparent only when 
it might be of service to others. 
Many of our eminent men lovingly at- 
tribute to Mrs. Ripley their first glimpse 
of greater possibilities.

"La Verite" Again 

By Helen Campbell 



" "|^\ UT why 'La VeritS'?" I asked 
1— £on another day as we turned 
M. ,# again toward the little street, 
quite familiar now, since my companion 
had settled contentedly upon this spot 
as the most desirable one in which to 
take his lunch, in this case the regular 
dijeuner d la fourckette, the real break- 
fast, which no Frenchman would dream 
of taking before eleven or twelve or 
even a trifle later. 

"A kind of general declaration of 
war, I take it," Bert replied. "To tell 
the truth seems to be a passion with 
madame, and with the husband no less ; 
for I find they speak it very literally, — 



a method quite unknown to a Rus- 
sian imperialist, — anyhow, to the half- 
dozen I have come across, for they lie 
mellifluously and smoothly about so 
many things that are not so that I 
am on my guard all the time. Good 
fellows enough, you know, but afraid 
of being mixed up with the other gang, 
— the Anarchists I mean. I dare say- 
she might He, too, if it were a question 
of shielding a friend under suspicion; 
but I don't know. Her eyes are as 
clear as a June sky. The police nose

they seem to have settled on this busi- 
ness. Money and place both for them 
in Russia, if they chose to accept 
things as they are and drop all prop- 
aganda work; but, if they crossed the 
border at this stage, both would be 
sent to Siberia, or the casemates, which 
is worse. In the mean time, if she 
will cook, let us rejoice that we know 
it. Will you try a demi-franc to-day? 
You had an American breakfast, and 
can stand it well enough.' ' 

This was a slander; for only one ex- 
ceedingly small egg had been added to 
the caje-au-lait and rolls served at 
eight, — a custom long adopted at home 
as one means of simplifying life, but 
still frowned upon by the hearty young 
fellow accustomed to steak or chops 
and the hot breads for which his soul 
still yearned. 

"I wonder what she'd say to old 
Dilly's popovers and flapjacks," he 
murmured with a sort of yearning as 
we went up the stairs. "Couldn't you 
tell her about them some day?" 

The day came when she was told, 
listening with serious attention, and 
producing, as the result, very delicious 
French rolled-pancakes with jelly. 

"For dessert, yes, but for breakfast, 
— nevaire!" she exclaimed as Bert re- 
monstrated. "That is barbarous, — so 
large and thick and with syrup to 
flood them all. Barbarous ! Nevaire ! ' ' 

To-day the half-franc meant ceufs- 
au-diable, — a single egg broken into 
the pretty brown and white German 
ware, the diable, an extra touch of 
cayenne in the brown butter which 
served as sauce. Then came a little 
ragout of veal with potatoes delicately 
brown and crisp, and compote* of sev- 
eral fruits, followed by the little cup 
of black coffee. We began with half 
a yard of crisp French bread at each 
plate, the loaves hardly more than 
large bread sticks. Half a franc at 
many a cheap restaurant in the Quar- 
tier would have given double the 



amount, and savory as well; for we 
had tested more than one with dark 
doubts as to the proper name for the 
meats before us. But here all was 
beyond suspicion, each thing so care- 
fully perfect in quality and prepara- 
tion that one sighed for more. In fact, 
Bert, who had settled also on a half- 
franc dejeuner, sighed deeply, and then 
called, "Encore, chere madame, encore 
une portion," and ate it unabashed. 
"I wish Dilly could walk in, and find 
out how to get this taste into an egg, ft 
he said with eyes full of regret on the 
second empty dish. "What does it, 
anyhow? I wish you'd study it out, 
and write to them at home about it." 

"It is inspiration, child. Mere words 
wouldn't hold that. One woman takes 
a recipe, and follows literally every in- 
struction; and yet her product some- 
how lacks something that an old col- 
ored cook, who has never looked at 
a rule in her life, gives with absolute 
certainty. Of course, we must be sci- 
entific, but" — 

"Thank the Lord for all 'buts'!" 
my hearer interjected. "They are the 
saving grace in everything in this work- 
a-day age, art and all the rest. What 
is this compote, anyhow? I've just 
struck a bit of pineapple, but there are 
prunes. Not the order I am familiar 
with in America, — what they gave us 
at college, for instance, — but ethereal- 
ized, if that's the word." 

Madame was near; and she laughed 
her mellow laugh, as she looked at the 
inquirer, answering him in the English 
she tried at times to use. 

"It is ends of jars, mon ami, — jars 
of confitures, — the bottoms to see; and 
all of them I make wiz ze prune, so." 
And she indicated the process of put- 
ting through a sieve. "But zere is 
vin rouge and spice also, and zis is 
compote." 

"Heaven send another like it!" Bert 
said fervently, as she moved away. 
"How can you resist spending another

half-franc, and having more of this 
divineness, however she got it to- 
gether?" 

"Tout va pour elle, — all goes to- 
gether for her," the husband said with 
a smile, his English much more uncer- 
tain than hers, but half a dozen other 
tongues coming easily, it seemed. 
4 'And the little Marie, she learns also, 
and Justine, sa scpur, who looks with 
great eyes to do as she can. Soon it 
will be three cooks, and a bigger house 
it may be; but for me, it is this one I 
will stay in, if so I shall." 

Sitting and chatting in this way, the 
table had gradually cleared, and we 
alone remained. "You like so much 
to know all, you like to see, too," said 
madame, and led the way to the 
kitchen, so small that her results 
seemed even more miraculous. It was 
the usual stone table under the chimney 
hood, holes in it of various sizes for 
the charcoal, and more of them than 
usual; but an American cook would 
have pronounced the getting of a meal 
impossible. The tin blower, a big cone 
with tall funnel, known as le diable, 
went over one or another hole as it 
became necessary to quicken or in- 
crease the heat ; but the saucepans sim- 
mered peacefully, others keeping hot 
in the long bain Marie at the end. An 
open dresser for dishes, etc., but no 
closets, no storeroom, no anything the 



English or American housekeeper de- 
mands as essential. I meditated on 
"left-overs"; but in this type of house- 
keeping there are no "left-overs." All 
meats are carefully trimmed, the trim- 
mings going to the stock pot, to evolve 
presently in soups of all orders. A 
portion meant barely enough for each 
person, yet it was enough. The sum 
of the meal meant satisfaction to each 
hungry eater; and again I meditated 
on the section in our multitudinous 
cook-books devoted to "left-overs," 
and wondered if life might be easier, 
if we, too, adopted the portion system. 
But here courage failed. That meant 
a new education for butcher and grocer 
and all the army who cater for the 
American household. It meant also 
a new education for the eater, — a 
training, approximating the recent ex- 
periment at Yale, as to amounts and 
how they should be eaten. Here, 
complex as combinations might be, 
each simmered as no average cook 
would ever allow at home, a red-hot 
range and a dancing pot-lid, the symbol 
of the dinner to come. Not even the 
cooking school, sown broadcast as it 
were, has yet altered this fact for the 
great majority of American homes; 
but, more and more, other possibilities 
are dawning, and perfect food, perfectly 
prepared, may yet, even in our day, be 
the portion of a hungry people. 



In a Poppy Boat 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 



We will sail, my sweet, in a poppy flower, 
We will sail away to a silver shower 
Of sand that falls at the sandman's hour,- 
Sail, sail, my little one, sail! 



We will anchor far on the Dream sea deep. 
Where the poppy petals will fold and keep 
Their drowsy watch o'er my wee one's ileep,- 
Rest, rest, my little one, rest! 



On" the morrow's morn, with the sunrise red, 
When our bird sings loud in its cage o'erhead 
And'the poppies glow in the garden bed, 
Wake, wake, my little one, wake! 



The Modern Baby 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



OF all modern fads the most 
depressing and chilling is that 
of the Institution of the Baby 
on a hygienic foundation. No longer 
can he, she, or it, be rocked, dandled, 
and kissed. Scarcely does hygiene per- 
mit it to be smiled upon save at long 
distances, lest closer approach convey 
a germ. No longer may a lonely woman 
peer into a baby carriage, to feed her 
eyes with the sight of a baby, lest she 
breathe upon it unawares. Nor may 
she by cooing phrases and gesticulations 
inveigle it into any kind of response 
lest she excite or weary its brain. 
Yet just because a baby is the 
sanctuary of the home do grand- 
mothers and aunts long to touch it 
in worship and to fondle it in affec- 
tion, but the new doctor and the 
new mother forbid in the name of 
hygiene. So affection is starved in 
the hearts of the elders; and the 
babies grow up into independent boys 
and girls, who do not know how 
to caress their fathers or kiss their 
mothers. 

The scientific training of a baby 
begins before its advent with pictures 
of Madonnas and with lace wrappers. 
It advances to a miniature rubber 
bath tub, to untrimmed, long-sleeved, 
and high-necked wardrobe, to a cradle 
without rockers, to the "three gifts" of 
Froebel, and to a Record Book for 
observations on its progress. Its meals 
are punctual. It neither cries nor 
laughs. It is laid down in a plumb 
line. It is smiled upon in geometrical 
fashion, and reasoned with as if con- 
science were already grafted on to it. 
Joy and spontaneity, the sudden hug 
and the merry play, are stifled under 
the spell of system and hygiene, until 
the young mother is a most unmotherly 



being and the young father is a prig 
in nursery lore. 

Such a baby may not have colic, but 
it will not have heart. Wide awake, it 
may be put away to sleep for a speci- 
fied time; but it will go a- wandering 
as soon as, grown up, it gets a chance. 
It is called by its full name, talks 
grammatically, arranges intuitively a 
"color scheme" before it is in the 
Kindergarten, and no longer interferes 
with fun and society. Yet the New 
Mother, all unconsciously, has missed 
the happy hours her mother had, and 
has evolved into the Modern Woman, 
to whom Home is an incident; and 
there are no fathers who walk the floor 
at night, cradling their crying babies 
in their arms. 

Young doctors are responsible for 
this change in values, this increase in 
hygienic knowledge, and this decrease 
in human affection. The younger the 
doctor is, and the less fatherly his 
temperament, the more is he addicted 
to system and hygiene. 

The Baby's diet, also, has undergone 
rare chemical changes. Nature fail- 
ing, forty years ago, the cereal, groats, 
took her place. Then came the equip- 
ment of sterilized milk. Now that is 
set aside for modified milk, prepared 
by the formula of the attending phy- 
sician, which grandmothers arranged 
by common sense without calling it 
" modified.' ' If one could only arrive 
at finalities, instead of having each crop 
of doctors and each series of dietetics 
decrying the past, there might be a 
haven of rest for specific remedies. But 
foods are like text-books: the last is 
always the best. 

All these improvements would not 
matter, if the outcome were simply 
greater health; but it means also less

normal, satisfactory ways of growth 
of the heart and spirit, until the young 
mother herself becomes an institu- 
tional fad, consoling herself with sta- 
tistics that prove the longer life of each 
generation offsets the smaller number 
of births, which is, of course, a better 
state of things than when many were 
born to die early. 

Doubtless babies are healthier and 
more self-controlled than were their 
mothers. But is there not, also, to-day 
less personal love and more humanita- 
rian service than in the past ? So many 
girls are eager for social service, from 
collecting penny saving-stamps to being 
at the head of a Settlement, who find 
it irksome to be useful at home. Pas- 
sion for humanity, the pleasant excite- 
ment of comradeship in work, new 
scenes and diverse nationalities, motley 
events, all combine to make social ser- 
vice a definite, pleasurable, concrete, 
organized kind of work, compared 
with home usefulness, with parents 
whom one has always known, with 
housework, — which cooking schools, 
however, are rendering easier each day, 
— and with the dull, plodding routine 
of just being useful because one has 
no special talent. 

The well-brought-up baby early as- 
similates this tendency of the day to 
work outside of home, for it gets used 
to Collectivism in the kindergarten* 
All through its school life, clubs and 
social centres present themselves at- 
tractively, till, by the time the Modern 
Baby has become a woman, she is fitted 
for the arena of social striving, ready 
to grapple with problems. 

If the Baby marries, she, in turn, will 
become a "dutiful" mother, whose 
"duty serves in place of interest," as 
H. D. Sedgwick has so finely said in his 
article on the "New American Type," 
in the Atlantic Magazine for April. 
"In the American woman, passion 
fades before self-consciousness, mater- 



nal love, shrivelled to a sentimental 
duty, hardly suggests the fierce animal 
instinct, the unloosed, vital bond be- 
tween mother and child." And then 
he compares the picture of a mother 
and child by Sargent, in which "the 
mother, waits, as in an antechamber, for 
a formal introduction to the child," 
with Romney's picture, in which the 
"mother bends over her child, birth 
has caused no* spiritual separation, she 
and it are one creature." 

No severer indictment has ever in- 
directly been brought against the New 
Mother than in these words, the truth 
of which arises way back in the Insti- 
tution of the Modern Baby. More of 
"instinct," more of caress, more of 
rapt enjoyment in a baby, would not 
interfere hygienically with its develop- 
ment. But emotion is to be repressed, 
lest it become too acute, nursery rhymes 
are to be abjured for Wordsworthian 
couplets, and self -activities are to be de- 
veloped, till the Baby becomes in itself 
a cerebral function and a bodily condi- 
tion of weighed and measured values. 

And, withal, the Baby is just so much 
poorer by the weight of kisses never 
given, by the loss of cuddling and com- 
forting, which make it sympathetic with 
affection, joy, and sorrow. But, as off- 
set, when the Baby is an adult, she is 
a useful citizen, for which she has been 
assiduously trained, ready for "Social 
Service"; while all along the line of 
education the Home has yielded to the 
State the blithest joys of parenthood 
and childhood. 

However, one cannot always be pes- 
simistic, since Ian Maclaren has written 
of "His Majesty Baby"; and since so 
many of us have known the blessed 
domination of the Baby, converting a 
home or a trolley car into an abode of 
welcomes, dispelling sadness, and mak- 
ing grandmothers and aunts happy as 
they hold in their arms somebody else's 
Baby. 



Bacteria 

By G. M. Holman, formerly Instructor in Institute of Technology 

[Reprinted from August-September issue, 1898] 



THE word usually suggests 
only disease and suffering. If 
anything not easily explained 
happens, it is frequently ascribed to 
the deadly microbe: it matters not at 
all whether any microbe is known to 
produce the trouble or not. Such is 
the craze, such the fashion, of our day. 

Despite all this, — being taxed with 
a thousand ills of which they are inno- 
cent, — the bacteria do deserve the at- 
tention of housekeepers ; deserve to be 
understood, not as disease germs, but 
as the direct cause of numerous other 
troubles and worries. 

What are bacteria? Little plants; 
the very least of all plants; always in- 
visible without the aid of the very best 
microscopes, and yet, so incompre- 
hensibly numerous, their effects are at 
once apparent, and closely related to 
our daily lives. Little masses of jelly 
enclosed in a delicate membrane; 
spheres, or short rods, incapable of 
any great motion, yet so light as to be 
wafted about in the air, and so small 
that a mote floating in a sunbeam may 
be the bearer of numbers of our little 
foes. 

The essential condition of their ex- 
istence is moisture; and darkness is 
£ favoring condition. Their require- 
ments as to food are easily satisfied, 
so the wonder is not their marvellous 
numbers, but rather that there are not 
more of them. 

Where do they live? Everywhere. 
Earth is their home; from there they 
are washed into the water by the rains; 
and the winds, raising clouds of dust, — 
yes, the lightest breath of air, — may 
eddy and whirl up an invisible cloud 
of them. 



Earth, air, and water are germ-laden, 
and yet we live! It is well to note 
that fact. Despite our being sur- 
rounded with germs, in and upon 
everything most closely associated with 
our daily existence, we still live; and 
there seems but one conclusion, — very 
few are so harmful as to endanger 
human life. 

Existence can, however, be made 
very disagreeable, particularly in the 
kitchen, by these little things when 
out of place, — when in our food, and 
especially when in the delicate pre- 
serves and carefully prepared stores of 
fruits, upon which so much time and 
labor have been expended, in order to 
keep them; for, if there is any one 
thing a microbe really enjoys, it is to 
"spoil" a can or jar of fruit that has 
been most carefully prepared. 

Just a glance at their methods of 
life will give a clew to the best way of 
avoiding such calamities. 

All our foods are rather complex 
compounds, and of their constituent 
parts a given germ requires, say, but 
one atom or particle in many hun- 
dreds; but its very life expresses itself 
in its ability to detach and appropriate 
that one particle, thus breaking down 
the original composition, and forming 
the entering wedge of decay. These 
particles are, little by little, changed, — 
soured, it may be, — each little organ- 
ism contributing its mite of manufac- 
tured acid; and the result is a sour, 
fermented jar of fruit or preserves. 

They multiply with most astounding 
rapidity, so that the presence of oixe, 
when our goods are put away, may 
easily mean their entire destruction, so 
soon as the single cell has divided

often enough to attack the contents all 
along the line. Usually, they simply 
split into two, these into four, and so 
on; and, if they would confine them- 
selves to this method, we could easily 
free our preparations of them: but a 
good many, — and these the most ac- 
tive and persistent, — instead of divid- 
ing, concentrate themselves into little 
particles, surrounded by so dense and 
impervious a membrane that ordinary 
degrees of heat have but little effect 
upon them. 

A thick solution of sugar renders 
conditions unfavorable: so fruits pre- 
served in syrup are fairly easily kept. 
Any great acidity is fatal to them: 
hence pickling has been evolved from 
experience; and, in the same way, with- 
out a knowledge of why, a brine or 
1 'pickle," strong in salt, was early 
found to be a safe material for keeping 
perishable substances. 

Not all desire each and every fruit 
so disguised with sugar as to be no 
longer fresh. Pickled fruits are of 
limited use, and salted ones still more 
so. 

Now, strange to say, some sugar 
rather helps than hinders our little 
foes ; and the comparatively weak acids 
of fruits serve, in a measure,* as food for 
them. To preserve such delicacies in 
their own juices, or in slightly sweet- 
ened water, then, necessitates freedom 
from all bacteria; but, as they are on 
(not in) fresh, unbroken fruit, in the 
air of the kitchen, and seldom, if ever, 
absent from the water, the problem is 
rather to get rid of them than to avoid 
them. 

We may boil the water before we 
use it, — and that is a great help in 
many a culinary operation of this kind, 
— but it is impractical to avoid all 
exposure of dishes, fruit, and jars to 
the air; and nothing is easier than 
infection that way. The most practical 
way seems to be some method of kill- 
ing them in the finished product, — to 



sterilize our canned fruits after they 
are ready to be put away for the sea- 
son. Of course the selection of whole, 
unbruised, unbroken fruit, and avoid- 
ing all contamination in every process, 
from first to last, renders this easier of 
accomplishment. 

Thorough cooking (boiling) will usu- 
ally remove the trouble. But, you say, 
we cannot boil, or even stew, our finest 
fruits, and have anything like a fresh 
product. We don't want to "cook" 
everything. True; and it is not neces- 
sary. When one of these vicious, tough 
little spores finds itself in a good situa- 
tion, — after the can of fruit has cooled, 
the danger of being scalded is past, — 
when you fondly believed your fruit 
canned, and it is put away in the cool, 
dry preserve closet, then this device 
of nature, this spore, germinates, and 
the microbe goes right on multiply- 
ing by simple division, as if nothing 
had happened. Your fruit is soon 
worthless. Some will be at work in 
a day, and most of them within three 
days. 

Let us suppose a case: Two jars 
were scalded; the fruit was hot; the 
jars were hot; and they were sealed 
tight. There was not a single microbe 
left alive, for it takes but little heat, — 
not even boiling, — for half an hour, to 
kill these fresh young lives. There 
may have been some spores, there 
probably were; and long boiling will 
not kill all of them, much less the 
moderate heat we have employed. One 
jar we put away: the other is treated 
as follows: The next day we place it 
in a dish of water — or, better, in a 
steamer — and give it a good hot bath 
for half an hour. The next day we 
repeat this, and a third time, always 
leaving a period of about twenty-four 
hours between the baths. What re- 
sults? The can not treated remains 
good for a week, two weeks, a month, 
perhaps, then begins to ferment, to 
sour and spoil. Some spores had re-

sisted, have germinated, slowly gained 
ground, and are doing their best to re- 
duce our fruit to simple substances, — 
are carrying on their legitimate busi- 
ness, but doing it inside our canned 
goods. 

The same spores germinated in the 
second can during its first period of 
cooling, — were young, tender plants 
when we gave it its first hot bath, and 
died. Again we cooled it, and during 
that time some tardy spores woke to 
life, only to be caught by the second 
bath. Perchance a few backward ones 
remain to be killed in the third heating. 
Working with good, clean, fresh fruit, 



good water, and giving the spores a 
chance to germinate between the baths, 
you may put such a can away, feeling 
sure of its keeping indefinitely. By 
such treatment you do not cook the 
materials, particularly if it is a large 
jar. A lower temperature, repeated 
three or four times, almost always 
effects sterilization; but, if one much 
below boiling water is desirable, on 
account of the delicacy of the flavor, 
smaller cans, and forty to forty-five 
minute baths, are safer. 

The whole matter is : kill off the suc- 
cessive crops, after the outside germs 
are shut out by a tight seal. 



Clam-bakes and Shore Dinners 

By Ella Newton Rhoades 



ONE of the many summer at- 
tractions in Rhode Island is 
the "clam-bake," for which 
Rhode Island has become famous. 
The genuine clam-bake is said to have 
originated, as it is recorded in Brad- 
ford's History, when the people "scat- 
ered up & down ... by ye waterside, 
wher they could find ground nuts & 
clames." But the incomparable repast, 
of which, profiting by the red men's 
example and instruction, they thus 
learned, did not develop to its best in 
Massachusetts, presumably because the 
Puritans could not bring themselves to 
believe that so much satisfaction, in the 
stomach, could be consistent with a 
proper fear of God, in the heart. 

It was in Rhode Island that the 
clam-bake presently established its 
habitat. In this State only has it 
been possible to find it in its native 
integrity, except, perhaps, in the towns 



of Swansea and Rehoboth, of Massa- 
chusetts, whose people, by a happy 
contiguity, have been able to pick up 
some crumbs of saving grace from the 
richer tables of their Rhode Island 
neighbors. 

The original Rhode Island clam- 
bakes were held after the haying season 
was over. The farmers with their 
families, usually in groups, were wont 
to go down to the shore of the bay, to* 
collect wood for a fire, stones to be 
heated, fresh and dripping seaweed, 
and, with these simple agencies, to cook 
the clams which they themselves had 
dug on the spot, throwing in with them, 
perhaps, a few potatoes and ears of 
corn from a neighboring field. At 
the proper time, when by the action 
of heat and saline moisture the clams 
had been brought to the point of open- 
ing their shells, the bake was opened, 
and the company in innocent merri- 



74 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



ment squatted or reclined around, serv- 
ing themselves as pleasure dictated, 
requiring neither table nor table im- 
plements, save such as they might have 
whittled from pieces of driftwood. 
And real Rhode Islanders are still 
given to maintaining that no other 
form of clam -bake is equal to this, and 
to some extent it still survives. 

The modern form of the clam-bake 
has now come to be the more com- 
mon offering. This may be located at 
a considerable distance from the shore, 
but not so far that the clams in transit 
shall lose their fresh flavor; and it may 
include several constituents that were 
not to be found in its prototype. But 
it is identical with the original in three 
absolutely essential respects: it must 
not be cooked with any other steam 
than that of rockweed on hot stones; 
it must be served in the open air; and, 
save the watermelon, which has been 
found to be a suitable stimulant after 
partaking of this particular shell fish, 
it must not include any kind of food 
that cannot be cooked together in the 
bake. 

The serving in the open air may 
permit the use of a tent without sides 
or a summer pavilion that has only a 
roof. But the strictly correct place 
of serving is in a grove or orchard, 
wherein has been spread, with few 
simple and substantial table imple- 
ments, an oblong table made of matched 
boards, placed across trestles, with 
benches rather than chairs along the 
sides. No cloth should be used; but 
the table should be cleanly and painted, 



preferably a light drab or a faint blue. 
It is always better, when possible, that 
the waiters who bear the food to the 
table should be volunteers from the 
assembled company. 

A clam-bake is never a dinner, no 
more so than is the collection of sand- 
wiches, eggs, olives, etc., which is of- 
fered for food at a picnic in the woods. 
A dinner has a gentle beginning and a 
nicely graded end. A clam -bake has 
no more beginning or end than a 
circle. It is just baked clams from 
first to last, with various appropriate 
accessories grouped around the central 
dish. 

A shore dinner, on the contrary, 
follows the accepted lines of other din- 
ners, as far as this is feasible without 
interfering with its distinctive differ- 
ence from other dinners ; namely, that 
its chief dishes and its predominant 
flavor shall be from the products of 
the sea. 

Of late years, all along the shore 
places have been built for this distinc- 
tive purpose. These dinners vary in 
place and price from an elaborate menu 
to the simple shore dinner, more like 
the original clambake, of which it 
takes the place. 

And yet, to thoroughly appreciate 
and enjoy the flavor of the most suc- 
culent of bivalves, one must attend 
a real, Rhode Island, clam dinner. He 
must remember, too, that fingers were 
precursors of knives and forks, and 
learn to dip into the savory dishes 
before the delicate morsels have grown 
cold. 




Striking Results from Keeping Microbes out 

of Milk and Water 



By Mrs. H. M. Plunkett 



ONE of the axioms of sanita- 
rians is that the death-rate 
of infants and young children 
— those over five years of age — is the 
true test of the sanitary conditions and 
of the sanitary administration of a 
community. 

The city of Chicago has been val- 
iantly and incessantly fighting to se- 
cure a pure milk supply, with a merci- 
less prosecution and punishment of 
the dealers who "water" or adulterate 
it with preservatives, which prevent 
its digestion. They have distributed 
millions of leaflets, in many languages, 
as to the care of milk after it reaches 
the consumer. They say milk treated 
with a preservative is valueless as a 
food, so that the child, while getting 
apparently a large amount of nutri- 
ment, is really starving. Good milk 
contains a large amount of nutriment, 
which is very easily assimilated. The 
danger in its use lies in the fact that, 
while it is a perfect food for man and 
animals, it also furnishes an abundance 
of food for the minute organisms called 
bacteria; and the germs of typhoid 
fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and 
tuberculosis, multiply in it with amaz- 
ing rapidity. The Chicago health 
board is also enforcing the thorough 
sterilization of all milk-bottles, and 
has instructed the mothers in the ten- 
ement districts that milk should not 
be left on the doorstep in open vessels 
in the morning. When taken in, it 
should be kept in a cool place, in thor- 
oughly sterilized and well-covered glass 
vessels, and not left exposed in refrig- 
erators to acquire odors and the ubiq- 
uitous microbes from meat, vegetables, 
etc. Tin and wooden vessels are very 



objectionable. The dust that would 
enter in the morning from the street 
is loaded with bacteria of many kinds, 
and soon cause the "souring" that 
people attribute to warm temperature, 
thunder-storms, etc. 

The result of these vigorous and 
unremitting efforts in Chicago are seen 
in the fact that, while in the last decade 
the population of Chicago has increased 
8 1 per cent., the death-rate of children 
(one to five years of age) has decreased 
42.4 per cent, in the same time, with 
a constructive saving of 57.813 lives; 
and, now that the women's clubs have 
taken hold of the matter, still more 
striking results are to be expected. 
Notwithstanding Chicago has spent 
many millions for pure water, her sup- 
ply of this necessity of life is still far 
from perfect; and the health commis- 
sioner urges all families to boil that 
which is to be used by the children. 

As an encouragement to effort in this 
direction, a short account of the ex- 
perience of a gentleman in New Jersey 
will not be amiss. His place of busi- 
ness was in New York City, but he 
was a permanent resident of one of 
the surburban towns, where the larger 
part of the inhabitants were mere sum- 
mer residents, living in small villas 
for a few months; and, though it was 
notorious that the water supply of 
the village, pumped from the river, 
was contaminated, these birds of pas- 
sage could not be induced to aid in the 
obtaining of a pure supply. Every- 
body knew that the river received the 
sewage from many villages above. 

One gentleman, who was highly in- 
telligent in sanitary matters, after 
many efforts to mend matters, resolved 



I 



76 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



to protect his own family, if he could 
do no more. He procured two large 
glass jars with ground -glass stoppers, 
and made it his own business every 
morning to see that enough water was 
boiled and cooled to fill these jars, 
which were then placed in the refrig- 
erator; and the maids were warned, on 
no account, to give the children — two 
fine boys — any water from anywhere 
else. In one exceptionally hot season 
the children, in the houses about, all had 
cholera infantum, while his remained 



in perfect health. Many died. And 
after a number of years the summer 
denizens aided in procuring water 
from an uncontaminated lake. This 
gentleman's father and mother lived 
with him. They had grown up in a 
sparsely peopled, country region, where 
they never heard of contaminated water, 
and they looked on him as a deluded 
crank ; but he had his reward in freedom 
from illness in his household, while his 
neighbors had frequent attacks of intes- 
tinal disorder, especially typhoid fever. 



New and Novel Fruits 

By Julia Davis Chandler 

" \ DAY will come when the earth will be transformed, when man shall offer to his 
rt brother man not bullets nor bayonets, but newer grains, better fruits, fairer flowers." — 
Luther Burbank. 



IN classic Greece, it was the goddess 
Minerva who gave to Athens the 
olive. To-day, in America, it is a 
scientific and nature-loving son of 
Massachusetts, living and working in 
California, who bestows on us the 
plumcot. This Wizard of Horticult- 
ure, as Mr. Burbank is called, has 
evolved the Shasta daisy from daisies 
of several countries, hybridized the 
blackberry and raspberry, producing 
a fruit larger than either, induced 
prunes to grow without the pits, uid, 
since the large, sweet, pitless prune, the 
most valuable thing announced is this 
new fruit, the plumcot. 

As its name indicates, it is a com- 
bination of the apricot and the plum, 
the Prunus triflora, or Japanese plum 
and the common apricot. With the 
general form of the apricot, but more 
highly colored than either the plum or 
the apricot, with a skin uniquely soft 
and slightly silky -downy, with a shad- 
owy bloom, the plumcot is about as 



distinct as if it had been dropped from 
some Olympian hill. 

There are several varieties. Some 
have yellow flesh, others have deep 
crimson, pink, or white pulp. There 
are both clingstones and freestones. 
The seed usually resembles that of the 
plum, but sometimes it is more like 
that of the apricot. 

While all are delicious, Mr. Burbank 
says that the one with the apricot- 
colored skin has the finest flavor. Not 
for a year or two will the trees be for 
sale, and until then we must wait ; but 
some fine day, as we pass a fruit-store, 
we shall pause, and feel like saying, as 
children do : "W'ot's zat?" and indi- 
cate the plumcot. 

Australian Winter Rhubarb 

Only a drouth can make this rhu- 
barb cease growing. It sends up fine, 
new leaf-stalks constantly, the year 
round in mild climates, and, in more 
northern latitudes, it can be forced with 



New and Novel Fruits

success in winter. As it is both deli- 
cate in flavor and rich in color, it is 
sure soon to become a favorite. 

Rose-fleshed Pomelo, or 
Grape-fruit 

Pomeloes, now so fashionable and 
so generally liked, are really a new 
fruit yet to many conservative people. 
The first shipments from the South 
were made, in 1880 or 1885, to New 
York and Philadelphia. Even then 
Charles Downing, the great authority, 
wrote of the pomelo: "The pulp is 
sweetish or subacid, and the juice is 
rather refreshing. It is, however, more 
showy than useful, and certainly makes 
a magnificent appearance in a collection 
of tropical fruits." 

A new variety from the Bahamas 
is now being grown in Florida. It is 
said that it is destined to become a 
great market favorite, by and by, as 
the quality is so fine. 

With the pomeloes is classed the 
nocatee, an accidental hybrid of the 
pomelo and tangerine and bitter-sweet 
orange. As yet the supply is very 
limited, and authorities vary as to its 
value. 

The Rangpur Lime 

We are all familiar with the little 
green limes at soda fountains and the 
pickled limes, but this is very different. 
It resembles in form a mandarin orange, 
and is as brilliantly colored as the 
brightest tangerine. The skin peels 
easily, and the loosely adherent sec- 
tions and the absence of seeds adds 
to this resemblance; but, when it is 
tasted, it is a delicious lemon, and very 
pleasant eating, when a little sugar is 
added. They are to be had at some 
fruit -stores, and come from Florida. 

Japanese Persimmons 

We associate our native persimmons 
with raccoons, two things from the 
woods well liked by the colored race 



in autumn. After the frost has taken 
away their astringency, their soft, am- 
ber-brown pulp is acceptably sweet. 
When out for an October tramp, they 
are a pleasant feast; but beware of 
them while green! 

The Japanese persimmons are far 
larger and finer in every way, and 
gorgeous in coloring. Although intro- 
duced into the United States twenty- 
five years ago, they were grown only 
in California, then in Georgia, and 
some years later the Department of 
Agriculture sent specimens to Norfolk, 
Va., fearing that they would not live 
through winter weather in Washing- 
ton. They are proving more hardy 
than was expected. 

This is shown by the fact that a fine 
tree is growing a little below Phila- 
delphia on the opposite side of the 
Delaware River. Probably it sprung 
from some chance seed left by an over- 
flow. Little valued or understood by 
its humble owner, it proved a surprise 
and a treat to some botanists, who hap- 
pened there and were told to help 
themselves to its rich, dark, juicy 
fruit. There are many varieties. The 
main dividing line is between those 
that are dark and solid, with flesh more 
like an apple, yet juicy, and the beauti- 
ful yellow ones, with flesh like a golden 
tomato or plum. 

The dark ones have more seeds. 
When the two varieties, the dark and 
the light, are planted near together, 
they cross-pollinate; and on one tree 
there will be red, half-red, and brown, 
and rich intermediate shades, while 
the usual color is orange-red to ver- 
milion. They begin to color when half 
grown; but the early kinds should be 
left on the tree until soft, and the late 
ones should hang until a frost is immi- 
nent. Some left on the tree may hang 
until New Year's. Bailey says the 
round-shaped varieties ripen first, — 
the oblong last, and keep the longest, 
and that these latter should be house-

ripened. With some the astringency 
goes as soon as the fruit begins to ripen : 
with others it stays until the fruit is 
fully ripe. The mixed kinds and the 
light-fleshed are very delicious when 
about of a custard consistency in full 
ripeness. 

The writer has always regretted 
leaving a Louisiana plantation before 
a fine tree of Japanese persimmons was 
ripe, else she would have had pecks 
of fine fruit wherewith to experiment. 
The owner cared only for their beauty, 
and gave the scarlet and gold fruit to 
the dozen or more negro families on the 
place, as she said she knew of no way 
to preserve or cook them for desserts. 
Thereupon the writer searched several 
hundred cookery books for recipes. It 
became an interesting game of chance. 
Southern cook-books say persimmons 
can be pressed into cakes with bran, 
and dried for future beer-making. 
Finally, in a Chicago cook-book, 
" Three Meals a Day," there was found 
a recipe for 

Persimmon Preserve 
"Select those which are ripe and firm. 

m 

Allow an equal weight of sugar. The 
fruit must lie in water for twelve hours. 
vStew the fruit in water to cover until 
tender. Drain, and spread out to be- 
come cool and firm. Add a cup of 
cold water to every pound of sugar. 
Boil and skim until clear, then cook 
the fruit in it about ten minutes. 
Spread on dishes in the sun. To the 
syrup put the juice and peel of two 
lemons. Boil until thick. Return the 
fruit for twenty minutes." 

Probably two lemons to an ordinary- 
sized kettle is meant, and, also, the cul- 
tivated persimmons. The wild ones 
would hardly be worth so much trouble, 



and the supply is uncertain; while the 
yellow, Japanese persimmons from the 
South abound in our fruit-stores in the 
autumn and early winter. Many pass 
them by, thinking them either pale, 
hothouse tomatoes or tangerine or- 
anges, though a glance at the large 
green calyx would show that they were 
not oranges. 

Our best fruit-stores now advertise 
"hampers and baskets filled with hot- 
house grapes, Florida oranges, tanger- 
ines, persimmons, and other luscious 
fruits," which shows how persimmons 
are now classed. The very reasonable 
prices should enable every one to try 
persimmons for a novelty, at least. 
Like many another sweet fruit, their 
flavor may be heightened with brandy 
or a suitable cordial. They may be 
iced for the table or made into a bran- 
died preserve. The Japanese regard 
them as their choicest fruit, and the 
Chinese dry the dark kinds like figs. 

An early mention of our native per- 
simmons is in Adair's account of his 
life in the Indian country in America, 
published in London in 1775, in which 
he says the Indians make a ''bread of 
persimmons, barbecuing it in the woods, 
and it is pleasant eating." 

The Japanese name for persimmon 
and shell-fish is the same. The word 
"kaki" may mean either; and so a 
matron in Japan, wishing a pie made of 
Japanese persimmons, ordered her cook 
to prepare a pie of "kaki" for luncheon. 
The company came, and all went well. 
However, when dessert was reached, to 
the surprise of all, there came in an 
oyster pie. 

Considering the general use of the 
word "kaki" for uniform, also, it is 
not strange, at all, that the order was 
misunderstood. 




How to Cook Wild Duck 

By Carrie May Ashton 



YOUNG housekeepers, who have 
had little experience in cook- 
ing game, may be glad of a few 
simple suggestions in preparing wild 
duck for the table: — 

If the duck are plump and young, 
they will be much the nicer roasted. 

By no means skin them, as do so 
many, as by that method the best part 
of the bird is lost. 

It is by no means an easy task to 
singe them in the ordinary way so that 
all down be removed. 

A simple way is to rub them all over 
with alcohol, and then hold them over 
a tiny blaze. In a few moments the 
fuzz has burned off, and the rest can 
be removed by rubbing with an old, 
clean towel. 

Wash thoroughly with soda water 
inside. It is even thought best by 
many old housekeepers to boil a duck 
in soda water for ten minutes before 
stuffing, then rinse with clear water, 
and wipe dry. 

Onion dressing is usually liked in 
stuffing duck ; but, where it is not used, 
a small piece of fat salt pork is chopped 
fine and added. This last is thought to 
remove the strong taste from wild duck. 
» Roast in a covered roasting-pan, as 
you would roast beef or lamb, basting 



frequently. If young and tender, an 
hour or an hour and a half will be suffi- 
cient. 

If they arc to be fried, cut them up 
as "you would a chicken. Let cook 
in warm water for a few moments, 
to draw out the blood. Then cook in 
soda water for ten minutes. Wash 
in clear water, and return to the kettle, 
and cook in plenty of clear boiling 
water until two-thirds done. Drain 
off the water and wipe, then fry slowly 
in plenty of hot butter until tender 
and crisp. 

Make a gravy by pouring into the 
spider in which they were cooked one- 
half a pint of cream, and letting it come 
to a boil. Pour this over the birds. 

Always serve currant jelly with 
duck. 

It is a good thing to plan a simple 
rather than a hearty meal in connection 
with duck. 

Lettuce, served with lemon juice or 
a salad dressing, mashed or escalloped 
potatoes, pickles, bread and butter, and, 
for dessert, sliced oranges, a pineapple 
fluff, or lemon sherbet, are sufficient; 
and the dinner will leave a much better 
impression than a more elaborate one. 

If a- soup be desired, let it be of to- 
mato or some other simple kind. 



The Death of Summer 

By Mary Foster Snider 



Winds that love her wistfully are sighing, 
Golden-throated birds in grief are flying; 
Brooding shadows o'er green hills are creeping, 
Night's soft voices hold a sound of weeping; 



Sweet white lilies, guarding garden closes, 
Droop to die amid the shattered roses; 
Forest Naiads touch their harps in sorrow, 
Love and Summer both must die to-morrow.

ABOUT CIRCULATION 

WE have thousands of sub- 
scribers on our list who ap- 
preciate the course of the 
Cooking-School Magazine, and derive 
constant benefit therefrom. The ap- 
proval of these is a just source of pride 
and gratification. There are many 
more thousands of earnest housekeepers 
in the land who would be just as well 
pleased with our offering, provided the 
magazine could be placed in their hands. 
How to do this is our chief concern 
and steadfast aim. 

The magazine is too good to draw 
large sales at the news-stands. It deals 
too largely with matters of fact, hence 



does not appeal to the voracious ap- 
petite of the day for crude stories of 
frailty and fiction. Its message, plain 
and homely, is to the intelligent house- 
keeper, young or old, who is desirous 
of learning the best that can be done 
to day, in the conduct of home life. 
To these it aims simply to be ever 
helpful and inspiring. 

To make the Cooking-School Maga- 
zine more widely known, we depend 
largely upon the kindly consideration 
of appreciative readers, to whom we 
are already indebted. And we deem 
it an especial favor to receive from 
our readers the names and addresses 
of neighbors and friends, to the end 
that we may mail each a specimen 
number of the magazine. Again, for 
the favor of two new subscribers we 
continue to renew for one year the 
subscription of a present subscriber. 
Also, for a single new subscription we 
are pleased to mail, postpaid, any item 
from our list of premiums printed on 
another page. 

We hope we are not imposing on 
the good will of our readers, in thus 
suggesting how they may possibly 
render a kindly service to many a 
friend and, at the same time, aid us 
in trying to extend the patronage of 
the Cooking-School Magazine. We 
want to add at least one thousand 
new names to our list, each month of 
this year, dating from June last, 1904. 



THEORY AND PRACTICE AGAIN 

SCHOOLS of every kind and class 
are numerous. No conceivable 
department of science, or art, or 
belief, is in want of instructors. The 
specialist is everywhere abroad in the 
land. One can readily receive instruc- 
tion in subjects abstruse, or concrete, 
or mysterious, including athletics and 
mind healing. Every doctrine, cult 
and ism, old and new, from Hinduism 
to Dowieism, has its devotees; and

each is made the panacea for all life's 
ills. 

One thing, however, cannot be 
taught in the schools; and that is just 
how to earn an honest living. Theo- 
retical education, however subtile and 
complete, does not necessarily impart 
this one thing needful. Of the culti- 
vated tramp, instances are not rare. 
The most highly educated foreigner 
comes to this country and struggles 
for very existence, commits suicide, it 
may be, from sheer discouragement. It 
does not follow that the graduates of 
our schools, as a rule, are out of work 
or that they are incompetent; but it 
means that one may graduate with 
highest honors, and still be useless in 
point of service. The wants of the 
world are constantly changing, and 
to-day the practically trained are most 
in demand. 

In commenting recently on the train- 
ing of young women in household sci- 
ence, a lady was heard to remark: 
"Yes, the theory of domestic science 
is all right enough, but it will not cook 
a dinner. " And this is the very gist of 
the question. The proper cooking of 
a dinner is not the thing of least im- 
portance in life. From point of health 
and happiness, immediate and far- 
reaching, it is no less significant, to say 
the least, than the making of clothes 
and many another kind of handicraft. 
To know how to do is one thing: to 
do is quite another. In theory, music 
can be taught to many: to make music 
demands much training and diligent 
practice, and few there be who are 
willing to submit to the requisite con- 
ditions. The knack of teaching or 
preaching is commonly thought pref- 
erable to the task of doing, but the 
time has come when he that doeth 
shall receive the reward. 

The latest definition or formula of 
education is "happiness through use- 
ful activity, — animation, kindness, good 
cheer, patience, persistency, willing- 



ness to give and take, seasoned with 
enough discontent to prevent smugness, 
which is the scum that grows over every 
stagnant pond; and the object of edu- 
cation is that a man may benefit him- 
self by serving society/ ' A garment 
of this character cannot be made to 
order: it is the work of a lifetime. 
The education of the future, as far as 
the masses are concerned, will com- 
bine manual labor with intellectual 
training. In domestic science teach- 
ing, that branch of education which 
is of special interest to half the race and 
concerns the well-being of all, this maga- 
zine stands for that practical training 
which results from actual doing rather 
than from the pursuit of merely theo- 
retical courses of instruction. 

THE POWER OF USING BOOKS 

THE climax of a general edu- 
cation is intimate acquaint- 
ance with the English language 
and ability to use the same. Our sole 
excuse for teaching foreign and dead 
languages is a larger and more exact 
knowledge of our own tongue. Every 
teacher knows that the weakness and 
failures of pupils come largely from 
lack of clear knowledge of words and 
phrases. They fail to grasp the mean- 
ing of words. Problems, formula, and 
theorems become simple and plain to 
those who understand the terms in 
which they are stated or written. 
The whole question hangs on the mean- 
ing of words. The pupil who has been 
thoroughly trained in English is fitted 
to pursue any course of study. His 
acquaintance with other subjects is of 
very little consequence. 

Strange, but true, there are those who 
cannot learn to cook, because they will 
not learn to read and understand the 
meaning of a recipe. To carry out to 
the letter written directions is a dis- 
tinguishing accomplishment which few 
attain. An intelligent use of books,

then, is a first step in the way of suc- 
cessful attainment. It fixes often the 
boundary line between stupidity and 
efficiency, in active service. 

On this subject President Hadley, of 
Yale College, says : — 

4 'Men in every department of prac- 
tical life — in commerce, in transporta- 
tion, or in manufactures — have told 
me that what they really wanted from 
our colleges was men who had this se- 
lective power of using books efficiently. 
Any thing which has been taught our 
college students as shop-work they gen- 
erally have to unlearn at the beginning 
of their professional career. In any 
mere mechanical facility they find com- 
petitors without college training who 
surpass them in the details of execu-' 
tion. But if they know where to look 
for facts in books, and how to apply 
the teachings of those books to novel 
and difficult cases, their services are 
valuable from the first, and inestimably 
valuable as time goes on. The vision 
of such men is not confined to the single 
shop or group of shops: they have the 
whole world before them as a field of 
study and practice. Their ability is 
not that of the dextrous operative, 
who can do his ordinary work to per- 
fection, but tends to sink himself into 
the routine of that work : it is the ability 
of the industrial leader, equipped for 
any emergency that may arise." 



AMBIDEXTERITY 

MANY people are awkward in the 
use of the hands. Very few are 
capable of using both hands with 
any degree of skill. We see those who 
have unfortunately lost one hand 
become expert in the use of the other, 
even a left hand. As a part of the 
human mechanism, the hand is so 
remarkable and so essential to well- 
being, we often wonder that more at- 
tention is not given to the cultivation 
of greater dexterity in the use of either 



member. In our efforts to earn a liv- 
ing, a matter which presses urgently 
upon us all, the hands cannot be de- 
spised: they become almost indispen- 
sable! Why should work with the 
hands be regarded as irksome? 

The common saying that every boy, 
regardless of his future calling, should 
learn some trade or craft is fraught 
with meaning. Are the same words 
less applicable to girls or young women ? 
In more ways than one deft fingers 
are desirable. They not only multi- 
ply the chances of usefulness, but 
they greatly enhance accomplishments. 
Certainly manual training, in the future, 
will be regarded as an essential part 
of woman's education. The woman 
with unskilled hands is ill-fitted for 
the duties of modern life. Our fingers 
must be taught to do the will of the 
mind ; and we learn to do by doing. 



We need some one to believe in 
us. If we do well, we want our work 
commended, our faith corroborated. 
The individual who thinks well of you, 
who keeps his mind on your good qual- 
ities, and does not look for flaws, is 
your friend. Who is my brother? 
I'll tell you: he is one who recognizes 
the good in me. — Philistine for July. 



My mother was the most perfect 
democrat, in the best sense of the 
word, that I ever knew. It was a 
democracy which was the logical re- 
sult of the doctrines of the Old Testa- 
ment and of the New. It recognized 
the dignity of the individual soul, 
without regard to the accident of birth 
or wealth or power or color of the skin. 
If she were in the company of a queen, 
it would never have occurred to her 
that they did not meet as equals. 
And, if the queen were a woman of

erously. Put alternate layers of but- 
tered bread and blackberries, sprinkled 
generously with sugar, into a buttered 
baking-dish. Bake about an hour, 
and serve hot with cream or boiled 
custard. , 

Tomato Marmalade (Miss Wiley) 

Remove the skin from four quarts of 
ripe tomatoes and slice the pulps. Cut 
six large lemons in halves, lengthwise, 
and slice them very thin. Seed one cup 
of raisins. Put the tomatoes, raisins, 
and lemons into a preserving kettle, in 
layers, alternating, with four pounds of 
granulated sugar. Cook one hour on 
the front of the stove. Then set the 
kettle back, and allow the contents to 
simmer until it is of the consistency of 
marmalade. Put up, while hot, as 
jelly. This recipe makes about two and 
one-half quarts of marmalade. When 
properly prepared, no one article will 
be recognizable. 

Glazed Pineapple 

Remove the outer portion of the 
pineapple, cut the fruit in slices, and 
with a suitable cutter stamp out the 
hard core from each slice. Cook the 
slices in boiling water to cover until 
tender. Make a syrup of sugar, equal 
in weight to the prepared slices, 
weighed before cooking, and a cup of 
the pineapple water to each pound of 
sugar. Pour over the pineapple, cover, 
and let stand over night. Drain off 
the syrup, cook to the thread degree, 
pour over the pineapple, then reheat 
the whole to the boiling-point, and set 
aside. Drain off the syrup and repeat 
the boiling, etc., until the syrup, after 
the pineapple is added and the whole 
heated, is at the thread stage. Then 
stir until the syrup sugars upon the 
pineapple. 



Canned Lima Beans 

Only young, fresh-picked, green beans 
can be canned successfully. Beans of 
size suitable for drying cannot be 
canned with certainty of keeping. Fill 
the jars with beans, and set on the 
rack of a steam-kettle (or wash- 
boiler), covered with several folds of 
doth. Set the covers over the jars, 
put on the cover of the outer utensil, 
and let cook one hour after boiling 
begins. Then remove the covers, and 
add a teaspoonful of salt to each jar. 
Fill the jars to overflow with boiling 
water, set the covers in place, and let 
cook three-fourths an hour. Then 
tighten the covers, and let cool. 
Tighten the covers when cold, if neces- 
sary. 

Pickled Mangoes 

Score a circle around the stem of 
green peppers, a short distance from 
the stem, then cut out these with the 
stem, and reserve for future use. Take 
out and discard the seeds and veins. 
Make a brine of salt and water strong 
enough to float an egg. Let the pep- 
pers stand twenty-four hours in this 
brine. Drain, and fill with chopped 
cabbage, green tomatoes and onions, 
either one alone or all combined, in 
such proportion as is convenient. Sea- 
son the chopped vegetables with mus- 
tard seed, grated horseradish, whole 
cloves, cinnamon bark, and nasturtium 
seeds. To prepare the stuffing, use 
a cup of salt to a peck of chopped ma- 
terial. Mix the vegetables with the 
salt, and let stand twenty-four hours. 
Then drain in a bag, scald in vinegar 
to cover, and drain again. Mix with 
the spices, and use to fill the peppers. 
When filled, sew the tops of the pep- 
pers back in place with white thread. 
Pack the peppers in a stone jar, and 
cover with cider vinegar, scalding hot. 
Let stand over night, drain off the vine-

WE are often asked by young 
housekeepers what cuts of 
beef and mutton are best 
to purchase for roasting, when there 
are but two individuals in the family. 
This is not easily answered, for there 
are no good roasts for two. A pound 
and a half of beef tenderloin may be 
roasted: few other pieces of really 
tender meat are suitable for roasting, 
save such as are sufficient to serve 
a small family nearly the entire week. 
A two-rib roast, even when the meat 
is cut close to the bone on each side, 
will weigh about eight pounds. Con- 
sidering that it must be presented in 
some form several times and is at its 
best only once, we could hardly advise 
a family of two young people, who 
must count their pennies, to purchase 
such a roast. If the family be really 
fond of roast beef, it might be advisable 
to dine once a week at some public 
eating place, where good roast beef 
is known to be served. This subject 
has been touched upon in Query 904. 

Regarding Ices 
Many housekeepers think ices are 
too troublesome for home manufact- 
ure, but this idea comes from the in- 
frequency with which they are made. 
Things seldom made seem to call for 
more of an effort than they really do. 
A well-made ice-cream or sherbet, es- 
pecially during the summer season, 
gives more genuine satisfaction, for the 
money and effort expended, than al- 



most any other kind of dessert, and 
once in a while, at least, it would seem 
well worth a trial. The flavor and 
texture of the product are better, if 
the ice stand to ripen and mellow 
awhile after freezing ; but many an ice 
has been most gratefully received and 
pronounced most delectable that had 
not been turned into the can of the 
freezer, when dinner was announced. 

Then there are always parfaits, 
mousses, and souffles which call for no 
turning of crank. 

A cup of double cream and a cup of 
rich milk, such as may be poured from 
the top of a quart jar of milk, will 
beat solid and, with sugar and flavor, 
All a quart mould. Surely not an ex- 
pensive dessert, this! 

The "Strawberry Cream Filling," 
given among the recipes in the June- 
July issue for use in charlotte russe, 
jelly cups, and cream cakes, makes a 
good parfait (served unfrozen in a glass, 
this becomes a strawberry syllabub). 
At this season, blackberries may be 
substituted for the strawberries. Such 
a parfait would be improved by lining 
the mould with fruit sherbet. For 
blackberry sherbet add a pint of black- 
berry juice and pulp, with the juice of 
a lemon, to a quart of water and a 
pint of sugar that has been boiled fif- 
teen minutes. Half of this quantity will 
give all the sherbet needed to line a 
quart mould, and also "a taste" for the 
lad or lass who makes the wheel go 
round.

Many people look upon the crushing of 
ice as a dreadful undertaking that results 
in wet boots and bedraggled petticoats. 
But the neat woman can prepare her 
frozen dessert in her kitchen, made 
fine for Sunday, without leaving a 
blemish to tell the tale. Let us see 
how to do this. With an ice-pick and 
a few sharp prods in a line across 
the end of the ice in the refrigerator, 
a few pounds may be cracked off. 
Put this on part of a clean old bed- 
spread, fold over the ends and sides 
to enclose the ice, and a few blows with 
the flat side of a hammer makes the 
ice fine. Then pack the freezer. Take 
up the cloth by the corners, shake the 
ice crumbs onto the ground outside, 
and hang the cloth up to dry. Freeze 
the ice, set the tub into the refrigerator, 
and the work is done. 

Use of an " Ice Cave " 

After ices are removed from the 
moulds, or small cases are filled with 
ices (either cream or water) and dec- 
orated, or gelatine mixtures are un- 
moulded, all will be in much better 
condition to serve, if there be at hand 
a suitable place in which they may 
be set a short time to chill anew. 
Besides being in a good condition to 
serve, ices thus treated are ready at 
any moment to serve. The condi- 
tions in the crowded refrigerator are 
not always such as make this a desira- 
ble receptacle for delicate ices; but a 
zinc box, with door, surrounded on 
three sides by enclosed space to hold 
ice, furnishes just the conditions needed. 
In an illustration in June-July issue 
such a box, called an ice cave, is shown. 

If the open space be filled with salt 
and crushed ice in equal proportions, 
the ice cave makes a particularly good 
receptacle in which to freeze parfaits, 
mousses, and souffles. Frozen in this 



manner, the moulds need not be cov- 
ered. Souffles are thus frozen in the 
dish (or individual cases) in which 
they are sent to the table. 

Fruit Punches 

At this season something to drink 
is in great demand. For a change 
try rhubarb, raspberry, currant, pine- 
apple, or strawberry-ade. These, as 
also lemonade, are better, if sugar 
syrup rather than crude sugar be used 
for sweetening, but on no account 
should the fruit juice be cooked. Add 
this when the syrup has become cold. 
A little lemon juice, to "give point' ' 
to the particular fruit flavor that is 
used, is essential in all beverages of 
this class. Remember to use the 
sweet element sparingly, even if the 
beverage is to be served half frozen; 
for sugar is a fuel food, and, in conse- 
quence, is not "in order" during the 
heated term. Half a cup of sugar to 
a quart of liquid is enough for un- 
frozen mixtures: two-thirds a cup 
may be required when the beverage 
is to be frozen. But, while stinting 
on the sugar, be generous with the 
fruit juice; and, if the quantity at 
hand of one variety be scanty, add 
the juice of some other fruit, and call 
the concoction a punch. 

Ginger Beer 

Cut six lemons in thin slices, dis- 
carding the seeds, and cover with a 
quart of water. Boil one pound of 
stick ginger, or dry ginger root (bruised), 
in four quarts of water. Add six pounds 
of sugar, the lemon mixture, twelve 
quarts of water, one ounce of cream of 
tartar, and a cake of compressed yeast 
softened in a cup of cold water. Let 
the mixture stand twelve hours in a 
jar covered with a light cloth, then 
bottle.

THE kitchen by first right is the 
cook's domain. The butler's 
pantry — so called — and the 
dining-room are the field of the wait- 
ress's operations. The duties of the din- 
ing-room are carried on in public, and 
their perfect accomplishment depends in 
large measure upon the preparation 
made beforehand in the privacy of the 
pantry. The well-equipped pantry 
is furnished with a small refrig- 
erator and a gas range, as well as 
with the usual cupboards, sink, etc. 
In one of the drawers beneath the 
cupboards for china and glassware a 
box of paper in various styles should 
be kept, each of which has a distinct 
and proper use either in the kitchen 
or the pantry. In this box is a light, 
soft, silky paper for polishing cut glass 
and silver, non-absorbent paper, in 
which uncooked meat and fish may be 
wrapped, paper for lining cake-pans, 
ice-cream and charlotte russe moulds, 
and waxed paper for wrapping sand- 
wiches and food prepared for lunch- 
eons and picnics. This box contains 
also envelopes holding different -sized 
rounds of paper of various sizes to 
cover jelly and jam glasses, stoppers 
to take the place of those lost from 
milk-bottles, paper plates to hold food 
that is to be set aside in the refriger- 
ator, and absorbent pads, on which 
fried articles mav be drained. After 
a picnic or luncheon has been sent out, 
the rolls of paper will need to be re- 
plenished; for nothing more surely 
insures the serving of a picnic luncheon 



in good condition than does the use cf 
a goodly quantity of the right kinds 
of paper. Sandwiches, cakes, wafers, 
rolls, sliced meats, — in fact, everything 
packable, — may be presented in an 
immaculate and appetizing manner 
either by wrapping them in paper or 
by pressing between a crushed sheet 
of paper, whenever an article will be 
marred by coming in contact with a 
solid surface. The use of paper in 
packing dishes is also obvious. 

When a picnic has been announced, 
the waitress acquaints herself with the 
menu that has been selected, and 
early on the preceding day makes 
ready such things as she may find con- 
venient. A small, plain casserole with 
tight-fitting cover, or even a jelly 
tumbler with metal cover, will serve for 
a butter jar. In this the butter is 
packed, and set aside to become cold. 
Fruit jars are scalded, and made ready 
to receive cream, sugar, tea, and coffee, 
cooked vegetable salads, etc. Sand- 
wiches may each be wrapped in its own 
special piece of paper. 

A few words as to the making 
of sandwiches may be helpful to 
some. 

Bread that has been baked twentv- 
four hours is of the right texture to 
slice evenly. Loaves baked in the 
Pullman sandwich pan cut to the best 
advantage. These pans are made with 
tight -fitting covers, but the bread is 
more wholesome, if in baking the cover 
be discarded. Remove the crust, then 
cut in even, quarter-inch slices. Trim

the upper side, but for travelling, 
lunches, and picnics do not cut into 
shapes more fanciful than rectangles 
or triangles. Butter the bread after 
it is sliced, also apply a moist filling 
after the final shape has been secured, 
and do not spread either quite to the 
edge, thus avoiding the soiling of the 
fingers when the sandwich is eaten from 



the hand. Meat for sandwiches should 
be cut across the grain and as thin as 
possible. Use several slivers of meat in 
each sandwich. In packing the ham- 
per or basket, let each article of food 
be separated completely from every 
other article, and, if possible, dispose 
all strong-flavored articles in closed 
receptacles. 



A Morning Breeze 

By Amelia C. Clay 

She purchased her husband a coffee-cup 

Of the true, genuine ring. 
A common cup it twice filled up, 

The , great-souled, generous thing! 



Her husband lifted the coffee-cup, 
"I'll ever its praises sing," — 

These words he cried, and cunningly eyed 
The great-souled, generous thing. 



One morning she lifted the coffee-cup 

To admire its decorating; 
And there looking up, 'neath a buttercup, 

Was a woman, — the saucy thing! 



"Oh, dear," she cried, "oh, dear, the cup,- 

The cup, why did I bring? 
Each time you sip, you touch the lip 

Of that great ugly thing!" 



"Nay, nay," he said, "just look at the cup, 

See her floating apron-string, 
Her cap and gown, — and do not frown, — 

She's only a motherly thing. 



"Still, if that way you view the cup, 

If you're really worrying, 
I'll take it," he said, "and break her head, 

The great-souled — u — ugly thing." 



*"Oh, no, no, no, we'll keep the cup, 

Forgive my flurrying. 
It's only," she said, "a painted head 

You great-souled, dear old thing!" 




Peaches, Preserved and Fresh 

By T. Celestine Cummings 



PEACHES differ in size and color 
even more than in flavor, and 
some of the smaller kinds are 
better eating than their more showy 
compeers. Clearstone peaches are 
easier to handle. Clingstones have 
much the better flavor. The pink and 
red fleshed sorts are more tempting, 
after cooking, as in pies and short- 
cakes. Yellow fruit without red stain 
at the heart makes a lighter preserve 
than white, and, being commonly 
firmer, is better for drying either in 
sugar or without. 

Canned Peaches 

Pare the fruit with a silver knife 
and in small quantities, as it quickly 
discolors from exposure to the air. It 
is a good plan to drop the pieces in 
ice-cold water until the last piece is 
pared. Drain thoroughly before add- 
ing to the syrup. It is always best to 
do up a small quantity of fruit at a 
time, to insure perfection in the result. 
It will amply repay for the extra time 
it takes. Two working together will 
make the task an easy one, one paring 
while the other cooks and pours the 
fruit and syrup into the cans. The 
peach- pit seeds should be blanched 
and added to the syrup, as they serve 
to enrich it with their flavor. Peaches 
require very little cooking. Make a 
syrup, allowing one cup of sugar to 
one cup of water. Let boil a few 
minutes with the seeds, then put into 
it as many halved peaches as will fill 
a jar. Set the preserving kettle back 
on the stove where it will merely sim- 
mer, and let the fruit cook until you 
can pierce it with a straw, but not 
tender enough to break. Remove each 
piece separately with a skimmer, fill 
the hollows with one of the peach seeds, 



fill the can with the fruit, and pour 
over it the boiling syrup. Slip in care- 
fully a silver knife to allow all the air 
bubbles to escape, fill to overflowing, 
and screw on the tops, tightening them 
more as the fruit cools. 

Peach Marmalade 

If you have a quantity of poor 
peaches among the good ones, use these 
for marmalade. Cut them up, and, 
if ripe enough, press through a potato 
ricer or mash fine with a silver spoon. 
Add an equal amount of sugar to 
the pulp, the juice of one lemon, and 
a dozen peach kernels. Cook very 
slowly half an hour, stirring frequently 
to prevent burning. 

Peaches in their Skins 

For this preserve select the finest 
crimson peaches in the market. Wipe 
each one, to dust off the fuzz, and 
prepare a heavy syrup made of a quart 
of sugar to a pint of water. This pre- 
serve calls for the new wide-mouthed 
can. It has a lid like an inverted china 
cup. Into this can you can drop whole 
peaches without squeezing them, and 
the lid keeps the fruit permanently 
under the syrup. Steam the peaches 
till soft enough to pierce with a straw ; 
lift each one carefully, so the skin re- 
mains unbroken, and drop in the can. 
Fill as full as possible without the 
slightest squeezing, and then cover 
with the boiling syrup. This canned 
fruit will keep years, and the flavor of 
the peaches will be as fine as the fresh 
fruit. 

Dried Peaches in Sugar 

It is a good plan to choose a very 
hot day for this process, and finish 
them early in the morning. When 



Peaches, Preserved and Fresh 



101 



the sun is hot enough, they can be 
dried in one day. This may be done 
in a cool oven, but they lack the fine 
flavor of the sun-dried peach. Pare 
fine yellow peaches, and cut them in 
halves, taking out the stones. Drop 
into boiling syrup made of four cups 
of sugar to one cup and a half of water. 
This quantity will be sufficient for six 
pounds of peaches. Let the fruit sim- 
mer till tender. It will begin to have a 
transparent look when ready. Lift each 
peach very carefully, roll in powdered 
sugar, and lay on a platter. Set in 
the sun to dry. If syrup oozes from 
them, remove to a dry dish. When 
perfectly dry, pack in a jar with sugar 
about them. When preparing for use, 
let soak over night, and stew in the 
same water. They will be found to 
have as fine a flavor as the canned 
peaches, and will keep any length of 
time. 

Peach Shortcake 

Sift four level teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder with two cups of flour and half 
a teaspoonful of salt. Mix in a fourth 
a cup of butter and a tablespoonful of 
sugar. Add milk sufficient to make a 
biscuit dough, roll out in two layers, 
and bake in one pan, with flecks of 
butter between. When done, remove, 
and butter the under crust well. 
Spread with peaches that have been 
pared and cut in sections. Sprinkle 
with sugar, and place on the upper 
crust. Butter this, and cover with 
peaches. Arrange halved peaches 
around edge of shortcake, and fill in 
each little hollow with a pyramid of 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored 
with a little almond extract. Cover 
the top with the cream also. 

Peach Roll Cake 

Bake a sponge cake mixture in a 
shallow oblong pan. Pare and mash 
fine ripe peaches. Sweeten to taste, 
and whip into the pulp the stiff -beaten 



whites of two eggs. Spread this over 
the cake, roll up and pin closely in a 
napkin, to keep it from unrolling. 
When cold, cut in inch-thick slices, 
and serve with whipped cream. Use 
almond flavoring always with peach 
sauces or creams. This cake should 
be eaten while fresh. 

Peach Trifle 

Put a layer of sliced and sweetened 
peaches in a deep glass dish, and cover 
with a thick layer of sponge-cake 
crumbs. Pour over this a rich soft 
custard, while still warm, reserving the 
whites of two eggs. Add to these two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and beat until 
stiff. Spread over the custard, and 
keep on ice until ready to serve. 

Peach Gems 

Pare and divide into halves one 
quart of peaches; add half a cup of 
sugar and water, and cook until the 
peaches are tender. Reserve six of 
the halves unbroken and rub the re- 
mainder through a sieve. Reheat, and 
when boiling add two level tablespoon- 
fuls of cornstarch, moistened in a little 
cold water, and cook in double boiler 
ten minutes. Take from the fire, add 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice and a 
few drops of almond extract. Beat the 
whites of two eggs stiff, and add to 
them, gradually, the peach mixture 
while it is still warm. Butter six gem 
moulds or coffee cups, and place the 
half of a peach in the bottom of each. 
Fill two-thirds full with the mixture, 
and bake fifteen minutes in a moderate 
oven. Turn out, and serve hot with 
sweetened cream. 

Peaches with Sherry 

Select large luscious peaches. Place 
peach or other leaves on a glass dish, 
with a glass nappie by it containing 
sherry syrup. The peaches are to be 
pared and cut in sections, and dipped 
into the syrup from the points of silver 



ioa 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



toothpicks, or dropped into the syrup 
and eaten with a spoon. To make the 
sherry syrup, put a pound of best lump 
sugar and one dozen peach seeds in a 
glass jar, cover an inch deep with good 
sherry, and set in the sun, stirring oc- 
casionally until the sugar dissolves. 

Baked Peaches 

Set a dozen ripe, pared clingstone 
peaches in a baking-pan. Cover them 
with sugar, dot with flecks of butter 
and a squeeze of lemon juice. Bake 
half an hour in a quick oven. These 
are delicious, served with game, fowl, 
or any highly seasoned meat. People 
who like highly spiced dishes sprinkle 
over their peaches a dust of "cayenne" 
pepper. 

Peach Omelet 

Pare and pit three mellow peaches, 
and mash fine. Add two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and the yolks of three well- 
beaten eggs. Then stir in lightly the 
whites of the eggs, stiff -whipped. Turn 
into a pudding-dish, and bake in a 
quick oven fifteen minutes. Serve im- 
mediately. 

Candied Peaches 

Choose fine ripe peaches, pare, halve, 
and pit them. Boil a pint of sugar 
with half the quantity of water until 
it is brittle. Test by dropping in cold 
water. It should break with a snap 
when of the right consistency. Dip 
the halved peaches in it, and set them 
aside on a buttered dish to harden. 
Whip the whites of four eggs stiff, mixing 
in four tablespoonfuls of sugar and two 
tablespoonfuls of blanched and chopped 
almonds. Drop on buttered paper, 



and place in oven for a moment to 
set. Place one in each peach centre. 
Keep in cool place until serving. Red 
raspberries, put in peach centres first, 
are an added deliciousness. 

« 
Whipped Peach Cream in Baskets 

Beat the whites of four eggs stiff, and 
mix in, gradually, four tablespoonfuls of 
sugar and two tablespoonfuls of peach 
syrup from preserved peaches. Stir in 
lightly one pint of sweet cream. Whisk 
to a stiff froth. Everything should be 
cold to use. Keep the bowl setting in 
a pan of cracked ice while whipping up 
the ingredients. Have ready round, 
individual sponge cakes with the centres 
scooped out, leaving three-fourths an 
inch on the bottom and sides. Just 
before serving, fill these baskets with 
the peach cream, brush over the out- 
side of the basket with white of egg, 
and stick in halved walnut meats or 
pecans. 

Peach Dainty 

Pare, cut in halves, and pit a dozen 
ripe peaches, reserving a few of the 
pits. Boil these in half a cup of water 
fifteen minutes, then strain. Mix to- 
gether half a cup of sugar with a 
tablespoonful of flour. Butter a deep 
pudding-dish, and place in a layer of 
peaches. Sprinkle with sugar and dots 
of butter. Proceed in this way with 
layers of peaches until the dish is filled, 
then pour over the pit syrup. Make a 
rich biscuit crust for the top. Roll out 
quarter inch thick, cut incisions for 
steam to escape, and bake in moderate 
oven. In serving, cut the crust in 
pieces, as for pie, put the fruit on top, 
and cover with cream whipped or plain. 



Made with Ginger 

By Mary Taylor-Ross 



ONE can give a unique touch 
to the tea table — a touch that 
is sure to prove popular — by 
the use of some of the delicious prepa- 
rations made from preserved ginger. 
It is wise to ask for "West India per- 
served ginger," when purchasing it at 
the shops; for this sort is rather ten- 
derer and finer in quality than the or- 
dinary kinds. 

The boughten preserve is apt to be 
rather expensive. Therefore, it is wise 
to learn how to crystaHze the ordinary 
green ginger at home; and with a sup- 
ply of this latter dainty, and a single 
pot of the former, any quantity of 
ginger delicacies may be concocted. 

The ordinary green ginger root can 
be bought for about twenty-five cents 
a pound, and one pound is sufficient 
for a large quantity of the crystalized 
dainty. Ask for the "stem ginger," 
since this is less apt to be coarse and 
stringy, and then wash and scrape it 
well. Throw the pieces into cold water 
for a few moments, and then place it 
over the fire in the same water to cook 
till tender. While it is cooking, pre- 
pare a rich syrup of white sugar and 
a little water; and, when it has boiled 
down, drop the tender ginger roots into 
the syrup, and draw the saucepan to 
the back of the stove, letting the con- 
tents simmer until the syrup is nearly 
absorbed. Turn the ginger out on a 
sugared sieve, and let it remain over 
night. In the morning break the mass 
into pieces or with a sharp knife cut 
the ginger into thin circles, which 
should be rolled in sugar. Pack away 
in layers with paraffin paper between, 
and plenty of sugar, and keep air-tight 
until all is used. When the ginger 
is sufficiently cooked in syrup, it 



will be almost transparent and quite 
tender. 

From the preserved ginger delicious 
bonbons may be made by combining 
the ginger with fondant and fruits of 
all kinds, as well as nuts. 

Ginger Dates are very easily made 
by taking oblong pieces of the preserved 
ginger and pressing them into the 
cavity made by removing the pits 
from some really fine dates, and then 
rolling the stuffed dates in fine sugar. 
These may be varied by pressing a 
blanched almond into each cavity with 
the ginger. 

Ginger Bonbons are made by cover- 
ing a piece of preserved ginger with a 
fine ball of fondant, and rolling it in 
fine sugar or in sugar that has been 
stirred into some fine chopped nuts. 
The ginger may be chopped very fine 
and stirred through the fondant, to 
which chopped nuts may be added as 
well, and the whole formed into bon- 
bons and rolled in sugar. 

Dainty ginger desserts are a pleasing 
variety in frozen dishes, and are quite 
easily made. Ginger Sherbet is made 
by boiling two cups of water with one 
of sugar fifteen minutes, and then add- 
ing half a teaspoonful of gelatine, dis- 
solved in cold water. Strain through 
a fine cloth, and, when cold, add a cup 
of lemon juice and two tablespoon fuls 
of the liquid from a jar of preserved 
ginger. Freeze as usual, and then, be- 
fore packing the sherbet in ice and 
salt, stir in two heaping tablespoonfuls 
of preserved ginger that has been cut 
up into fine shreds. 

Ginger Cream 

To make this dessert, one must have 
a thick rich cream, or use gelatine, if 



io4 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



the cream is thin. Measure the cream, 
and for each pint allow three ounces 
of preserved ginger, cut up into fine 
shreds, and two tablespoonfuls of the 
ginger syrup. Whip the cream till 
very stiff, sweeten to taste, and then 
stir in the ginger and the syrup. Whip 
again, and then place directly on the 
ice. Chill some thin glasses, and at 
serving time fill the cream into these 
glasses. Lay a bit of preserved ginger 
on top of each one, and serve at once. 

Ginger Jelly 

Make an ordinary lemon jelly, ac- 
cording to the directions on the pack- 
age of gelatine. Just before the jelly 
becomes hard, stir in half a cup of pre- 
served ginger, cut into pieces about 
half an inch in size. Set away to 
harden, and serve with whipped cream 
that has been flavored with just a sug- 
gestion of brandy. 

Ginger Cakes 

Something quite out of the ordinary 
will be found in this recipe. Put one 
large cup of light brown sugar and one 
quart of the best molasses in a sauce-pan, 
and set over the fire to cook twenty 
minutes, taking great care that they 
do not burn. At the end of this time 
stir into the molasses one pound of 
fresh butter, one pint of the best pre- 
served ginger, and one teacup of the 
syrup from the ginger jar. Sift into 
a bowl three quarts of flour, and into 
this one tablespoonful of ground and - 
sifted ginger. Make a sort of well in 
the sifted flour, and pour the contents 
of the saucepan into it. When suffi- 
ciently cool to handle, work it up into 
a pliable dough, and roll out on the 
board. Make into a rather thin sheet, 
cut into round cakes, and bake in a 
moderately quick oven till crisp and 
brown. Use only enough flour to hold 
the dough together nicely, or the cakes 
will be tough. If handled just right, 
these cakes are excellent. 



Ginger Chips 

These crisp morsels are made by 
rubbing half a pound of butter into 
a pound of flour, and mixing in half 
a pound of brown sugar that is free 
from lumps. Add one tablespoonful of 
powdered sugar, one teaspoonful, each, 
of powdered cloves and cinnamon, and 
one tablespoonful of ground ginger. 
Stir into this a pint of the best New 
Orleans molasses and the grated peel 
of one large lemon. Add a little of 
the lemon juice for flavoring, and half 
a teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a 
little warm water. Stir hard, and mix 
in just enough flour to make a very 
stiff paste. Roll out very thin, and 
cut into narrow strips, about one inch 
wide and three or four inches long. 
Bake in a moderate oven ten minutes, 
and then pack carefully away in air- 
tight boxes. These cakes will keep 
nicely until all are used, and are a 
good "stand-by" for the housewife. 

Ginger Ale 

Ginger ale is the foundation of many 
agreeable drinks and fruit punches, 
since almost all fruits and flavors seem 
to harmonize well with the ginger and 
lemon of which it is made. In two 
gallons of water dissolve three pounds 
of white sugar, and add the beaten 
whites of three eggs and two ounces 
of ground ginger, previously dissolved 
in water. Let the mixture come to a 
boil, skim, and set aside to cool. Now 
add the juice of four large lemons, one 
fourth a yeast cake (compressed) pre- 
viously dissolved in a little water, and 
stir the mixture thoroughly. Let stand 
for a few moments, and then strain 
through a cheese-cloth bag, and pour 
into bottles. Set away in a cool, dark 
place, and, in forty-eight hours, the 
ginger ale will be ready to drink. An 
acid flavor may be given to this ale 
by squeezing the juice of half a lemon 
into a tumbler, and then filling the glass 
with the ale.

Marriage and Small Incomes 

THERE has been considerable dis- 
cussion in the newspapers recently 
as to the advisability of people marry- 
ing on small incomes, r While the pub- 
lic was airing opinions pro and con, a 
practical woman in a domestic science 
school, who wished to show both the 
actual and possible divisions of the 
housekeeper's budget, decided to make 
tabulations to this effect. 

The conclusion reached at the end of 
the research was this: that no fixed 
division can be given for a certain in- 
come, as rents vary and individual 
preference is too important a factor. 
Food expenditure is more under the 
control of individuals than the rent; 
and, as it is in this direction that the 
greatest waste occurs, a study of food 
economy is more important. 

Among the peqple visited by this 
enterprising woman was an East Side 
German family, the members of which 
were nine, including the father and 
mother. The combined income of the 
family was $67.50 a month, the father, 
eldest son and daughter, bringing in 
the amount stated. The division of 
this income is a most interesting study 
in economics, and is correctly given as 
follows: rent, $22 (which is high, but 
not considered extravagant, as the 
family prefers to have comfortable 
quarters and economize in clothing) ; 
food, $30; clothing and sundries, $12,50. 

At this rate the food for nine people 
costs one dollar per day, this amount 
supplying all the food used except the 
father's lunch, which is given him 
where he works six days in the week. 



Frau Gretchen manages her food 
problem by giving meat once a day and 
baking her own bread. Butter is never 
served when they have gravy. On 
Saturday night Gretchen goes to mar- 
ket at ten o'clock, after all the Kinder 
are in bed. She then buys the meat 
for the entire week. If it is winter, she 
keeps the meat on the fire-escape. If 
it is summer time, she partially cooks it. 

From one large roast or boiling piece 
she makes three dinners, using the 
bone, for soup. Stews also are used to 
a great extent, with a variety of dump- 
lings. Sometimes she varies the basis 
of the meat stock by buying turkey 
and chicken feet for soup. Says she 
wisely, "Men do not eat as much meat 
as they think they do : what we have 
got to do is to make them think they 
have it." 

Her method of economizing fuel is 
interesting. On wash-day she cooks 
a number of things, like soup, dried 
fruits, cereal for several breakfasts, 
beans, potatoes, etc. 

It is needless to say that she does all 
the family sewing, and economizes 
along these lines as well as in her culi- 
nary department. Not one garment 
is cast aside as worn out, until every 
particle of good material in it is utilized. 

Gretchen's book-keeping methods are 
unique, if not strictly up to date. She 
has three small wooden boxes labelled, 
respectively, "Rent," "Food," "Cloth- 
ing and Other Things," and "Good 
Time" box. When her husband and 
children give her their wages, she di- 
vides them according to the foregoing 
schedule. 



io6 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



The "Good Time" box is replenished 
by contributions from the younger 
children, who pick up occasional pen- 
nies by doing errands. This fund is 
left intact, until enough accumulates to 
take the entire family to Coney Island 
(which place is their Mecca), and they 
have a gala-day together. 
" Each child has some household task 
to perform, and not one would think 
of wasting a penny on gum or candy. 
They enjoy their little sacrifices for 
the common good, which ensues to all. 
Their physical condition is best indi- 
cated by stating that they have never 
been obliged to call a physician, — a fact 
of which many people who have ample 
means cannot boast.

Resting-places 

BEDS may come, and beds may go; 
but sleep goes on forever! 

It is not my aim to tell of the curious 
steps resting-spots in the home have 
taken in the last century, though that 
is an interesting tale in itself, — from 
the quaintness of the four-poster and 
the trundle-bed to the practical modern, 
iron bedstead, from the elaborate patch- 
work quilt and woven bedspread to the 
many styles of beautiful bed linen the 
shops of to-day offer. Instead I would 
suggest a few diversions in planning bed 
and couch furnishings for those people 
who are not able to follow every whim 
of fashion, who perhaps have unsightly 
furniture, handed down from a former 
generation, that must do a modern duty 
in an old-fashioned manner. 

A bed may be a thing of beauty, but 
more often it is not. Many a house- 
wife is conscious that her bedsteads 
are a blot in an otherwise pretty room. 
At night sleep beguiles consciousness 
into oblivion, and the dream-ship car- 
ries us off to pleasant harbors. 

Nothing could be more unsightly 
than the elaborate brass bedsteads to 



be seen in many furniture shops; and 
woe to the mistaken housekeeper who 
spends her money for such ponderous 
furnishing! The simpler the frame- 
work of the bed, the better, as long as 
this be consistent with strength; and 
nothing could be daintier or more 
cleanly than the chaste white iron 
bedstead with brass knobs. Brass rods 
fastened at the sides of the bed make 
a pretty addition. From them hang 
chintz curtains to within half an inch 
of the floor. Blue and w r hite chintz 
is particularly pretty, and a blue and 
white bedspread carries on the idea. 
The pillows should be dispensed with 
during the day, the round bolster being 
much preferred by up-to-date house- 
wives, as making the bed look neater. 
An effective cover for this bed's bolster 
is made of old-time patchwork style, — 
blue and white patches in square tile 
design. This cover is drawn in at the 
ends with blue silken cords. Its chaste 
simplicity will be its best recc mmenda- 
tion. 

For a more elaborate bedstead, poppy 
is a pretty fancy, where red is chosen 
to predominate in the room, as the 
poppy flower is emblematic of sleep. 
A plain iron bedstead is painted green. 
Four iron uprights are attached to the 
four corners, with cross rods fastened 
at the top for valance curtains. This 
arrangement of rods is a cheap addi- 
tion to any bed that is not of itself 
pretty. The valance gives the sug- 
gestion of the old-time canopy, with 
none of its hot, shut-in disadvantages. 
The valance curtains are made of white 
material, with a broad band of red 
stitched at the bottom. Poppies cut 
from the same red material are couched 
on the white cloth in clusters with black 
rope linen. A few heavy stitches of 
the same black easily makes the centre 
of the poppy. Green strips of cloth 
serve as stems. Curtains of the same 
design fall from rods at the side and 
foot of the bed to the floor. The mak- 



Home Ideas and Economies 



107 



ing of cloth flowers with broad petals, 
such as the poppy, the rose, the sun- 
flower, etc., will be found to be re- 
markably easy, even to the novice in 
embroidery. The rapidity of the couch- 
ing stitch, and easy arrangement of 
the more or less conventional designs 
and rigid stems and leaves, are great 
points in their favor. Quick results 
and infinity of possible patterns make 
it a delightful field of fancy work. 

Another poppy bed for the possessor 
of the clumsy wooden bed with a high 
head-board may be made by painting 
the bed white. Do not have the up- 
right frame on the bed, but simply the 
curtains from the sides of the bed to 
the floor, made as described. Hang 
a picture of red poppies over the head- 
board against the wall, and on the 
white surface of the head-board itself 
paint the following in black letters: — 

Poppies, droop the Gift of Sleep above this bed, 
That, when the Night Farewell unto the Mora 

has said, 
I may arise with purpose new, and eased of 

care, 
To sow a Day with Deeds as bright as thou 

art fair. 

If a white bed be considered out of 
place in the room where the wooden 
bedstead must do service, the bed may 
be painted a darker color and the little 
verse painted in red letters instead of 
black. 

The modern college girl has made 
much of the fashion of a bed that 
through the day is a plain, sensible 
couch, covered with a cosmopolitan 
crowd of sofa cushions. Here, again, 
a little arrangement can make the girl's 
bedroom unique, and give it a touch of 
individual charm. 

The cosey corner has been a little 
overdone, and the too abundant sofa 
cushions make for an untidy look. I 
saw a couch recently that was a pleas- 
ing change from this well-known over- 
furnishing. The couch itself was pushed 
out at least two feet from the wall, so 



that a small stand was set behind it. 
This was covered with a large Japanese 
paper napkin, and was just large enough 
to hold a small Japanese vase, with its 
single flower, and the one book that the 
owner of the couch desired at the mo- 
ment. An Oriental couch cover gave 
pleasing color effect ; and the couch held 
but one sofa cushion of comfortable 
dimensions, carrying out the Japanese 
idea of the perfection of one detail. 
Fans and Japanese plates hung on the 
wall in precise arrangement; but the 
most curious feature was a large Japan- 
ese umbrella hanging directly over the 
head of the couch, but high enough not 
to interfere, in any way, with the com- 
fort of the person resting there. This 
umbrella was hung by three small chains, 
merging in one at the ceiling; and I 
found that it was held open by a ring, 
about a foot in circumference, inserted, 
the top beyond this ring being cut out 
entirely. The whole formed an in- 
genious shade to the ugly gas jet pro- 
jecting from the wall. A shower of 
dreams would surely touch the sleeper 
beneath but lightly ! v 

A clever girl of my acquaintance made 
pretty an ugly bedstead with a super- 
abundance not only of head-board, but 
of foot-board as well. First she painted 
the offending yellow wood a soft pale 
green, then cut from many seed cata- 
logues great sprays of pictured pink 
roses, pasting the same in clusters, 
leaves and all, here, there, and every- 
where* over the head and foot of the 
bed. A coat of thin varnish made 
them look like captured beauties from 
June bushes, held there to dream about 
awhile. Small brass rod's at the edges 
of the bed held simple white curtains 
with a broad border of pink gingham 
around the bottom. 

Seats for hall, or dining-room window- 
seats, are very popular in modern fur- 
nishings. A charming seat can be made 
of a long, narrow, dry-goods box, two 
feet high, fitted with a top fastened 



io8 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



with hinges, so that it may be opened 
as a convenient receptacle for overshoes, 
golf sticks, etc. The sides of the box 
are painted a dull green or brown, con- 
ventional patterns of brass nails giving 
a solid effect. A narrow mattress, or 
long stuffed cushion, on the top is cov- 
ered with green denim. Back of this 
seat (unless it be placed by a low win- 
dow) small book-shelves project from 
the wall, to hold a few books. A solid 
panel between the shelves is of smooth 
wood, and has pressed ferns pasted 
upon it. These are varnished over in 
the manner before described. 

Another delightful seat may be 
planned in a dining-room with a long 
low window. Running along this win- 
dow is a window-box, just deep enough 
to hide flower-pots within its enclos- 
ure. The plants themselves can be 
seen from without and within. A 
couch beneath this window is a delight. 
Underneath the couch, shelves pull out, 
to hold table linen, etc. 
• Thus, in many ways, is the modern 
couch removed from its ancestor, the 
horse-hair sofa. These are only sug- 
gestions to those who must plan con- 
trivances in their homes ; for the possi- 
bilities are legion, and the thoughtful 
housewife might as well slip Beauty's 
hand in that of Comfort, when she is 
arranging the resting-spots in her home. 

Mrs. A. D. S. 



The Old and the New 

The baby slept well in the cradle of old, 

By the roaring blaze, when the nights were 

cold, 
And somebody rocked with rhythmic sweep, 
Till the baby eyelids were closed in sleep. 
In summer time, too, by the open door, 
Crooning a lullaby o'er and o'er, 
The foot must keep the cradle swinging, 
The tired voice must go on a-singing. 

The baby sleeps well in the cradle to-day; 
In the flickering gas logs the shadows play. 
With a rhythmic sweep does the^cradle rock, 
To and fro, like an eight-day clock. 



Wound up each night, it swings along, 
While the gramophone croons out the song. 
And the baby cares little, so long as there's 

swinging 
And the gramophone keeps up its singing. 

IN the real old, primitive, colonial 
times the kitchen was the warm, 
cheery centre of household activity; 
and the bedroom of the goodman and 
his industrious wife often opened 
from the kitchen, and received the 
spare warmth from the great fireplace. 

The children slept next the roof, and 
sometimes the wind whistled through 
the cracks, and powdered their blue 
homespun coverlid with snow. Now 
these old blue spreads are hung by 
their descendants as portieres. 

Many a bachelor girl, studying art, or 
living by her pen, as inky-handed daugh- 
ter of toil, in our great cities, treas- 
ures her few family possessions and a 
little family pride as well. As one 
said: "My pioneer great-grandparents 
had one fire, and lived by it, cooked by 
it, ate beside it. They warmed the 
baby by the blaze, rocked him to sleep 
there, and tucked him in the roomy 
home-made cradle. When the curfew 
bell rang out in the old white spire of 
the New England 'meetin'-house, ' they 
covered the embers for the night, knelt 
in prayer, and slept serenely, to rise 
before daybreak for another day's toil. 

And I! What has increase of 
luxury done for me? I, their busy 
descendant, have no broad acres, no 
forest from which to gain wood, — for 
that matter, no good man to hew it for 
me. I am a product of the twentieth 
centurv. Instead of a fire and a curfew 
bell, to warn all to put out fire and 
lights, I hire a 'heated room,' and, 
tucked up in it, I cook by gas my leisure- 
day, Sunday- morning coffee at ten, and 
my evening tea, and work till late into 
the night over my books. They had 
their bedroom near the kitchen fire, 
while I have my wee kitchen outfit in 
my bedroom, and wash my tea-cups in 



Home Ideas and Economies

the much-vaunted 'private bath-room.' 
I inherited a big sideboard, but I had 
no house nor home that it would go into. 
It was not quite large enough to move 
into and play house, as I did when a 
child with my dolls. So it had to go 
for what it would fetch, if it was an 
heirloom." 

Perhaps the most ingenious and con- 
densed housekeeping was arranged by 
a business woman. She bought a trunk 
and fitted it with an alcohol stove and 
a chafing-dish. A tiny gas stove with 
small rubber pipe might, also, do, if per- 
mitted. In the trunk she arranged 
places for her silver, utensils, and food 
supplies. She brought home her rolls, 
cake, pastry, eggs, fruit, canned meats 
and vegetables, from the best shops, and 
stored them in the trunk and in a win- 
dow refrigerator. When her tiny meal 
was over, the things went back in place, 
secure from everything and everybody. 
A bottle of port or fine jumbles could 
not be sampled, and nothing remained 
to cause disorder in the room. A tin 
box held anything superfluous, for the 
maid's benefit, and another was pro- 
vided for any waste food. Her dinners 
she took down town. 

Mrs. Partington said her barn was 
apropos to her house. If by that she 
meant conveniently near, the same 
might be said of light housekeeping 
under condensed modern methods; for 
everything is near at hand, and it has 
both its advantages and disadvantages.

Customs Change 

WHATEVER else people have to 
give up, they cannot cease eating, 
unless they expect to cease life itself. 
Hence, people can do without mandolins 
and silk dresses better than without gro- 
ceries and marketing. 

Recognizing this fact, it is noticeable 
how many societies of various kinds, 
churches and clubs have gone into 



some form of food preparation for 
profit. Of course, for long years, 
churches have held fairs and had sup- 
pers ; but now, in not a few instances, 
they have established permanent 
sales-rooms. The George Junior Re- 
public has bought out a bakery, and 
put chocolate and . ginger cookies on 
the market. The Book Lovers' Li- 
brary has begun to sell coffee, tea, etc., 
and expect to extend this limited list 
to a large number of high-class food- 
stuffs in packages or jars, bearing their 
brand always, though they are not 
put up- at especial factories, but are 
ordered from several, under especial 
guarantee of excellence. The foods of 
the Indians of Florida and New Mexico 
are already adapted to the table of the 
white man, and the favorite root of 
the South Seas is now on sale as a 
breakfast food. Not content with ran- 
sacking every part of the globe for food 
materials, the botanists and horticul- 
turists are hybridizing our fruits and 
berries, and so are constantly giving 
us new kinds.

Thirteen Cents a Day 

You can fare Sumptuously, it seems, 
for that Price 

Talk about living being high in great 
cities! Why, it is cheap, dirt cheap, 
in the most populous city of the United 
States, if the New York Educational 
Museum can succeed in teaching New 
Yorkers how to luxuriate on thirteen 
cents a day. 

According to the experiments of the 
Museum, at an expenditure of thirteen 
cents a day each, a family of six could 
have this menu served : — 



Oatmeal. 



Breakfast 

Codfish Balls. 
Butter. Coffee. 



Corn-bread. 



Luncheon 
Split Pea Soup. Toast. 



Butter. 



no 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



Dinner 

Beef Stew. Macaroni and Cheese. Rice. 
Bread and Butter. Suet Pudding. 

For seven cents a day more for each 
of the six, this menu could be followed : 

Breakfast 
Apple Sauce.- Oatmeal. 
Dried Beef and White Sauce. 
Baking-powder Biscuit. Coffee and Milk. 

Luncheon 
Turkish Pilaf. Peas (Dried). 
Bread and Butter. Cornstarch Pudding. 

Dinner 

Potato Soup. 
Baked Chopped Round Steak. 
Bread and Butter. 
Apple Tapioca. Milk. 

Compared with these the meals which 
can be provided for thirty-four cents a 
day, or a total of $2.04 for the family 
of six, are absolutely extravagant :— 

Breakfast 

Oranges. Cream of Wheat. 

Creamed Potatoes. Brain Croquettes. 

Popovers. Coffee and Cream. 

Luncheon 

Veal. Green Peas. Bread and Butter. 

Apple Tarts. Thick Cream. 

Dinner 

Tomato Soup and Croutons. 

Porterhouse Steak. Baked Potatoes. 

Lima Beans. 

Bread and Butter. Tapioca Cream. 

All these dishes are based on the 
standard of Professor Atwater, who 
has charge of the government's experi- 
ments in domestic science. 

It is an indisputable fact that many 
persons who have small incomes are 
not living as well as they might, and it 
is reasonably claimed by principals in 
the work that the menus suggested are 
better than the baker's bread and tea, 
on which the families of many laboring 
men are now subsisting. 

Professor Wiley, whose name has 
fairly become a synonym for sense in 
relation to dietetics, has made public 



some hot-weather hints that it will be 
well for every one to study and heed. 

Compressed into nuggets, this is 
what he says : — 

Moderation in all things eatable and 
drinkable, in hot weather, is the price 
of health. 

No alcoholics, or great moderation in 
their use; avoidance of iced drinks of 
all kinds, especially by those who are 
much exposed to the hot rays of the 
sun. Temperate people seldom suffer 
from sunstroke. If iced beverages are 
taken at all, they should be sipped 
slowly, not more than a teaspoonful at 
a time. 

Summer beverages should be taken 
at about 6o° Fahr., not at the tempera- 
ture of melting ice. 

A hearty, rapid drinking of ice-cold 
liquid in hot weather is always danger- 
ous. 

Ice-cream is permissible, if eaten 
very slowly. One should spend half 
an hour in swallowing an ordinary dish 
of this delicious relish. 

The quantity of food should be less- 
ened. One of the principal functions 
of food is to supply heat and energy. 
When the weather is hot, very much 
less of it suffices for the body's needs, 
and every ounce of excess taken into 
the stomach is a menace to health. 
At least one-fourth of the winter diet 
should be lopped off in summer. Even 
much less than this will keep the body 
thoroughly nourished. 

The foods peculiar to summer should 
be used in summer. This rule implies 
the free use of fruits and fresh vege- 
tables, with less flesh-meat, substitut- 
ing for the latter good bread, beans, 
peas, etc. But beware of under-ripe

For Pure Food 

The indifference of the American 
housekeeper to the question of pure 
food is a culpable indifference of which

in 



intelligent women should be ashamed, 
said a health official the other day. 

The indictment was quite true. The 
American housewife buys, statistics 
tells us, something like $100,000,000 
worth of adulterated food in a year. 
Luckily, only 10 per cent, of it is act- 
ually poisonous. But that $10,000,000 
worth of "dangerous and deleterious 
food " should be put on American tables 
annually is not a credit to the shopping 
powers of the feminine heads of fami- 
lies, surely. 

Here. are some of the facts: Seven- 
teen million dollars' worth of oleomar- 
garine is annually passed off on the 
American shopper for butter. The 
coffee trade offers so large a variety of 
swindles that their extent cannot be 



exactly computed. Six firms are now 
engaged in making machinery to turn 
out bogus coffee beans, moulded into 
correct shape and varnished with coffee 
extract. 

The shopper for food, therefore, must 
be on the alert. She has not a very 
difficult task, however, — only a pa- 
tient one. Butter and oleomargarine 
have very distinct qualities. A real 
coffee bean is lighter and altogether 
unlike in taste to the manufactured 
sort. Cheap canned goods, when com- 
pared with the honest article, show a 
thousand warning signs. Pure food 
laws, food inspectors, milk tests, etc., 
can all be insisted on by women of a 
community till they become the rule, 
and not the exception. — Exchange. 



Leaves from a Housekeeper's Diary 



By Kate Matson Post 



June 30 

Good-bye to the butcher, the grocer, the cook, 
Good-bye to the dust -pan and brush. 

I'm going to lie down in some cool, shady nook, 
And listen to blackbird and thrush. 

Good-bye to the numberless details and cares, 
The duties that housekeeping brings, 

The making and mending that's never complete, 
The door-bell that constantly rings. 

Who would not be free from such serfdom as 
this? 
From toiling that never is done, 
From the work that must be accomplished each 
day, 
To be the next morning begun? 



September 1 

I long for my own cosey, dear little home, 

My own table, daintily spread, 
Where my own dear children sit smiling each 
side, 

And their father there at the head. 

And I long for my own bright, cheery wood 
fire, m 

My own easy-chair, and my books. 
I can't help but wonder where summer hotels 

Ever find such atrocious cooks. 

I long for a beefsteak that's juicy and thick, 
Which is neither dried up nor raw, 

And a nice roasted chicken, crispy and brown, 
Which need not be cut with a saw. 



I long for the freedom and comforts of home, — 
Those comforts so sweet to recall. 

One does not need more than twojmonths to 
decide 
That home's the best place, after all.

" Recipes for thin peanut wafers and oat- 
flake cookies." 

Oatmeal Cookies 
Beat one egg until light. Add one- 
fourth a cup, each, of sugar, thin cream, 
and milk. Add half a cup of fine oat- 
meal, two cups of flour, two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking-powder, and one tea- 
spoonful of salt, sifted together. Mix 
thoroughly, then turn onto a floured 
board, roil out into a sheet, cut in 
shapes, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Peanut Wafers 
Cream together half a cup of butter 
and a cup of powdered sugar. Add 
half a cup of milk, drop by drop, then 
two cups of pastry flour, sifted, and a 
teaspoonful of vanilla. With a broad- 
bladed knife spread the mixture very 
thin on the bottom of a dripping-pan, 
inverted and buttered, and mark in 
squares, then sprinkle with chopped 



peanuts. Bake about five minutes, or 
until delicately colored. The heat of 
the oven should be moderate. Very 
quickly cut the wafers apart, turn upon 
the hot pan, and roll in a tubular shape. 
Roll either from one side or corner. 

Peanut Macaroons 
Beat the whites of three eggs until 
foamy. Add one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar, and beat until dry. 
Then beat in, gradually, half a cup of 
very fine granulated sugar. When all 
is in and the mixture is very light, fold 
in half a cup of sugar, one teaspoonful 
of flour, and one pint of peanuts, 
crushed or chopped to a fine powder. 
Drop, by teaspoonfuls, onto a tin lined 
with a buttered paper, making smooth 
rounds. Sift granulated sugar on the

Query . 904. — Subscriber, St. Louis, Mo. : 
"What kind of steaks are best to purchase, 
also what kind of roasts of veal and beef are 
preferable, and how many pounds of each 
should be purchased for a family of two or 
three individuals?" 

Steaks and Roasts for Family of 
Two or Three 
A sirloin steak is considered the 
choicest. A steak weighing about three 
pounds may be used for three meals. 
Cook the tenderloin first, as it does not 
"keep" as well as the other portions. 
As this is deficient in flavor, serve with 
it two slices of bacon. Chop the flank 
end (a tiny slice of onion, if approved, 
may be chopped with it), and cook in 
a hot frying-pan, until the color changes. 
Turn in a little hot water, let boil once, 
season with salt and pepper, and serve 
at once. Broil the top of the sirloin, 
third meal. The top of the round, 
chopped fine in a food-chopper, is 
particularly good, as Hamburg steak, 
or baked, as ' 'Cannelon of Beef." The 
fillet of beef from under the rump 
is a very convenient piece for small 
families. Any quantity desired, as 
half or three-fourths a pound, of this 
fillet may be purchased for broiling, or 
a larger quantity, as a pound and a half 
or two pounds, may be purchased for 
roasting. This is always tender and 
free from bone or waste material. 
Flavor needs to be added, and one of 
the most convenient ways of securing 
this is by means of tomato sauce. 
Three or four pounds of the rump of 
veal makes a good roast, and is not 
too large a quantity, as there is con- 
siderable bone. A slice of veal weigh- 
ing about a pound, from the leg, is best 
for browning, to be served with a brown 
sauce.

Query 905. — Mrs. J. h. D., Messorila, Mont.: 
"How may good cake be made in high alti- 
tudes?" 

Cake in High Altitudes 

The following recipes and sugges- 
tions are from an article on " Rocky 
Mountain Cookery," by Anna Virginia 
Miller, published in the March, 1902, 
issue of this magazine. ' ' Food here will 
not be light and easy of digestion 
unless plenty of eggs are used, and the 
eggs must be beaten, too, with long 
and tedious beating; for it takes a 
much longer time to beat eggs in this 
high altitude until they become thick 
and lemon-colored . " ' ' Baking-powder 
must be used more sparingly than for- 
merly." "From one-fourth to one-half 
less shortening than usual is the rule." 
"Usually in a cake calling for one cup 
of sugar about three-fourths a cup will 
be found enough." 

Rocky Mountain Sponge 

Make a syrup of three-fourths a cup 
of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of 
water by cooking together ten minutes. 
Cool, and pour gradually over the yolks 
of three eggs, which have been beaten 
until thick and lemon-colored, beating 
all the time, and continue the beating 
fifteen minutes. Add one cup and one- 
eighth of flour, one teaspoonful of 
lemon juice, and the whites of three 
eggs, beaten until stiff and dry. Bake 
in a loaf, in a moderate oven, three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Orange Cake 

Cream three tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and add one-half a cup of sugar. Beat 
two eggs until thick and lemon-colored, 
and add one-fourth a cup of sugar. 
Combine mixtures. Mix and sift one 
cup and one-half of flour. Add one 
teaspoonful of baking-powder, and add 
to the first mixture, alternately, with 
half a cup of milk. Flavor with half 
a teaspoonful of orange extract. Bake 



in gem-pans, and frost with golden 
frosting. For this take the yolks of 
two eggs, beat slightly, add sugar until 
thick enough to spread, and flavor with 
orange extract. The cake mixture may 
be baked in layer-cake pans, and put 
together with orange filling. This is 
made by cooking together, in a double 
boiler, half a cup of sugar, three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, the juice of one 
orange, the grated rind of half an 
orange, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, 
one egg t slightly beaten, and one tea- 
spoonful of butter. Some of the filling 
may be saved for the top of the cake, 
or, if a more elaborate cake be desired, 
frost the top with tgg frosting, and 
place sections of orange on top for a 
garnish. 

Mountain Snow Cake 

Cream one-third a cup of butter, and 
add, gradually, three-fourths a cup of 
sugar. Mix and sift two cups of flour 
with two teaspoonfuls of baking-pow- 
der, and add to the first mixture, alter- 
nately, with one-half a cup of milk. 
Beat the whites of four eggs until stiff 
and dry, and add to the cake, together 
with one-half a teaspoonful of almond 
extract. Bake in layer-cake pans, and 
put together with two cups of heavy 
cream, sweetened with one-fourth a 
cup of sugar, and flavored with half 
a teaspoonful of vanilla.

pour over the berries, washed, drained, 
and put into fruit jars. Fill the jars to 
the top, adjust the rubbers, and screw 
down the covers loosely. Set the jars 
on the rack, in a steam-kettle, covered 
with folds of cloth or paper, and sur- 
round with water at about the temper- 
ature of the jars. Bring slowly to the 
boiling-point, and let boil ten minutes. 
Tighten the covers, and let the jars cool 
in the kettle. Store in a dark, dry,

Delmonico Pudding with Oranges 

Peel six oranges and slice them into 
a buttered pudding-dish. Sprinkle 
with half a cup or less of sugar, and 
pour over them a puddinj made as 
follows: Stir half a cup of cornstarch 
with milk to a smooth batter, then stir 
into a quart of scalded milk. Let cook, 
stirring constantly at first, twenty 
minutes. Add a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, a few grains of salt, and the yolks 
of four or five eggs, beaten and mixed 
with three-fourths a cup of sugar. Let 
stand over the hot water two minutes, or 
until the egg is set, then turn the mixture 
over the oranges. Let bake ten minutes, 
then cover with meringue, and return to 
the oven to brown. Serve hot or cold. 

Meringue for Delmonico Pudding 

Allow twice as many level table- 
spoonfuls of fine, granulated sugar as 
there are whites of eggs. Beat the 
whites until very foamy, but not quite 
dry. Add half the sugar gradually, 
beating meanwhile. Then, when very 
light, fold in the rest of the sugar, and 
turn the meringue onto the pudding, 
drawing it up to a point in the centre. 
Score with a silver knife wet in hot 
water. Sprinkle with sugar, and re- 
turn to a moderate oven for about ten 
minutes. Garnish with sections of 
orange. Serve hot or cold. 

Poor Man's Rice Pudding 

Let one cup of rice and a quart of 
cold water quickly heat to the boil- 
ing-point, and boil rapidly five min- 
utes, then drain and rinse the rice in 
cold water. Add to the rice one cup 
of sugar, one tea^poonful of salt, one- 
half to one whole cup of stoned raisins, 
and six cups of milk, and set to cook 
in a moderate oven. Let cook three or 
more hours, stirring several times dur- 
ing the first hour to keep the raisins 
from settling to the bottom of the 
dish. If the pudding looks at all 
dry, pour in another cup of rich milk 



(or cream) about half an hour before 
the cooking is completed. Do not stir 
when adding this milk. The pudding 
is a success when each grain of rice is 
surrounded by a creamy liquid. 

Cereal with Dates 

Pour boiling water over half a pound 
of dates. Separate the dates with 
a fork, and stir and skim them from 
the liquid. Set them into the oven 
to become very hot, then stir into a 
dish of cereal, cooking over the fire. 
Let this stand about ten minutes, 
then turn into the serving-dish. 

Rhubarb Baked with Prunes 

Have ready cooked as many prunes 
as desired. Cut the rhubarb into short 
pieces, dispose a layer of these in an 
earthen or agate dish, and above them 
here and there a few of the cooked 
prunes. Sprinkle the whole with sugar. 
Prepare other layers of rhubarb, prunes, 
and sugar, and bake in a moderate 
oven until the rhuba:b is tender. If 
the rhubarb be old, it may be well to 
blanch it, before cooking, by allowing 
it to stand covered with boiling water 
five or six minutes. At least one cup 
of sugar will be required for each three- 
fourths a pound of rhubarb. 

Baked Tapioca Pudding 

Cook one-fourth a cup of quick- 
cooking tapioca in a pint of milk until 
transparent. Add a few grains of salt, 
a tablespoonful of butter, half a cup 
of sugar, and remove from the fire. 
Let cool a little, then pour over one 
or two beaten eggs. Add a teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla, and turn into a buttered 
baking-dish. Let bake in a very mod- 
erate oven until the egg is set. Three 
or four macaroons, crumbled fine, are an 
addition to this pudding. Serve, hot 
or cold, with or without vanilla or other 
sauce. If it be served cold, use from 
one-half to one whole cup of milk ad- 
ditional.

QuBRY 912.— Mrs. T. S. W. f St. John, N.B.: 
"Why do currants go to the bottom of cake? 
Why does pastry crawl from the edge of the 
plate?" 

Why Currants sink in Cake 

Currants sink in cake, if, bulk for 
bulk, they are heavier than the cake 
mixture, to which they are added. 

Why Pastry crawls from the Edge 

of Plate 

Pastry "crawls" from the edge of 
the plate, because all dough shrinks 
in cooking. Pastry used for making 
pies, should be spread loosely over the 
plates. This should be noted in con- 
nection with both the upper and under 
crust. By attention to this point 
much of the loss of juice in fruit pies 
will be avoided. 



Query 913. — Mrs. W. R. B. W., Burling- 
ton, Vt.: "The best way to keep bread in sum- 
mer to avoid moulding. How secure fine, 
even-grained bread? Why is half an inch at 
the lower part of the loaf of bread less light 
than the rest of the loaf? Why is milk bread 
less white than other bread, especially after 
it is two days old? I use one cake of com- 
pressed yeast to a pint of milk, and mix the 
bread in the evening." 

On Keeping Bread 

Let the bread stand overnight, after 
baking, in a cool room, covered with 
a single fold of cheese-cloth, to keep 
off the dust. Then store in a stone 
jar, freshly scalded with boiling water, 
and dried and aired in the sunlight. 
Do not put cut loaves or slices into the 
jar in which the uncut loaves are stored. 
Store such in another receptacle, which 
is freed from crumbs daily. 

Fine, Even-grained Bread, etc. 

The finest and most even-grained 
bread is most likely to be secured when 
the bread is made with the minimum 
quantity of yeast and the dough, 
kneaded until it is elastic (shown by 
tiny white blisters on the surface),

is kept until baking at a uniform tem- 
perature of about 68° Fahr. One- 
third a cake of compressed yeast to 
each pint of liquid, when the dough 
is mixed in the evening, will be all the 
yeast needed to secure the best results. 
Often the dough next the baking-pan 
becomes partly cooked before it is set 
into the oven, being set to rise on the 
shelf of the range, and, in consequence, 
does not become as light as the dough 
above, which is not in direct contact 
with the heat. We are unable to say 
why milk bread, after keeping, is less 
white than water bread. Would be glad 
of information on this point.

Query 917. — I. J. S. H., Yorkton, Can.: 
"Recipes for making mushroom pickles and 
catsup." 

Mushroom Catsup 

Pick over (wash and drain, if needed) 
one peck of mushrooms; slice these, 
and put over the fire with a little 
water, just enough to keep them from 
burning. Cover the saucepan, and 
let cook, stirring often, until the mush- 
rooms are soft, then press through 
a fine sieve. To the pulp add one pint 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of salt, 
half a teaspoonful of cayenne, two 
tablespoonfuls of mustard, one table- 
spoonful of cinnamon, and half a tea- 
spoonful, each, of mace and cloves 
(ground). Cook about half an hour 
longer (or until thick), then taste, and 
add such other seasoning as is needed. 
Bottle and seal. 

Pickled Mushrooms 

Wash thoroughly, and, if of con- 
venient size, put whole into glass jars. 
Set these onto the rack of a steam- 
kettle (with a cloth on the rack be- 
neath the cans). Put in warm water 
to cover the rack, and let steam fifteen 
minutes. Have ready enough vinegar 
scalded, with pepper-corns, cloves, 
mustard seed, celery seed, bay leaves, 
and chili peppers, to fill the jars. Pour 
this into the jars. Adjust the rubbers 
and covers, and let cook five or six 
minutes, then screw down the covers, 
and set aside. A tablespoonful of 
mixed spices will be enough for a 
quart jar. 

Query 918.— Miss B. B., St. John, N.B.: 
"Is fresh-cooked or canned salmon preferable 
for salmon salad, and should the salmon be 
used alone or combined with a vegetable?" 



Salmon Salad 

Fresh-cooked salmon is preferable to 
canned for use in salads. The salmon 
mixed with dressing — French, may- 
onnaise, or boiled — is generally served 
on lettuce leaves. The lettuce wilts 
too quickly to be mixed with the 
dressing and fish. Cucumbers or cooked 
peas may be used as a garnish, but 
think it preferable to use any vege- 
table that may be selected for use with 
the salmon as a garnish rather than as 
a component part of the salad*

gar, scald, and return to the mangoes. 
Drain off the vinegar, and scald sev- 
eral succeeding mornings. Then cover 
with fresh vinegar, made scalding hot, 
and set the pickles aside. A pint of 
sugar may be added to each gallon 
of vinegar. The time of preparation 
may be shortened by cooking the man- 
goes half an hour in the hot vinegar. 
Then drain, cover with a fresh supply 
and set aside. 

Canned Sweet Corn 

Select ears of corn "in the milk." 
Let them be fresh-gathered, having 
been removed from the stalk not more 
than an hour. Remove the husks and 
silk, and cut the corn from the cob, not 
too closely, and press out the milk from 
the hulls on the cob. Pack into jars, 
pressing down tight and filling to 
overflow. Cook two hours and a half 
in a covered receptacle, as for canned 
Lima beans. Then, if the cans are not 
full, fill from one of the jars, and cook 
an hour and a half longer. Another 
half-hour of cooking will do no harm, 
and is often needed, when a regular 
canner is not used. 



A Fishing Club Supper 

By Linda Hull Larned 



THIS club was a close corpo- 
ration, composed of men; but 
now and then it admitted a 
few choice souls who were not in the 
swim. This especial occasion was 
graced by the wives and sweethearts 
of the members, and among those thus 
honored was one elected to be hostess; 
and this appreciative soul opened her 
heart and home, and took them all 
in, one Sunday evening, and set before 
them an appropriate feast. 

An eye-witness of the affair has de- 
scribed it to me from start to finish, 
and I shall be happy to pass it on for 
the delectation of my sister house- 
wives. 

Beginning at the beginning, with the 
exception of the invitations which 
were inscribed on paper "garnished" 
with piscatorial designs, was, of course, 
the table. This was an oval of pol-^ 
ished oak, upon which were centre- 
piece and plate doilies of Chinese linen, 
embroidered in white silk dragons and 
strange fish. The centre-piece was 
then covered almost to its edge by a 
mirror. Upon the mirror was a new 
fish basket, filled with ferns and large 
white marguerites. A wide green satin 
ribbon of two shades was wound 
around, and tied in a huge bow at one 
end. Around the edge of the mirror 
white tulle covered with green tulle 
was lightly crushed. This was a no- 
tion copied from a Canadian function, 
when this club was entertained by a 
sister club in that Dominion. Upon 
this were sprinkled daintily, but artis- 
tically, many delicate ferns. Between 
this tulle border and the covers were 
small lace doilies on green silk linings, 
upon which were placed the dishes for 
bonbons, nuts, and other dainties. 
These dishes were polished shells left 



over from the days when such things 
posed as bric-i-brac on old-fashioned 
corner ' 'what-nots." Everybody re- 
members how hideous they were. I 
mean the "what-nots." The shells 
were unearthed from the corner of the 
attic, but they served the present pur- 
pose better than modern receptacles. 
At each cover was a souvenir, — a 
crescent-shaped box made of green 
cardboard to represent a bait-box, 
filled with those spiral candies which 
somewhat resemble a curled-up worm. 
These were for the ladies. Those for 
the men were small birch-bark canoes, 
to be used, when necessary, as ash 
receivers. The candy "bait" was 
green and white. The place cards were 
the crested card of the hostess, deco- 
rated with a real pin-fish hook and 
its wire tendril. 

The menu commenced with melon 
halves, extremely cold, as it was a 
warm evening, filled with cold fruit 
in syrup. The fruit was red rasp- 
berries, peaches, and pineapple. This 
was put in a glass jar, and packed in 
ice for a few hours before serving-time. 
The next course was cream of spinach 
soup in cups, then some delicious 
brook trout and a cream cucumber 
sauce. The pikce de resistance was 
beautifully arranged and set before 
the hostess, who served it on green and 
white plates. It was a silver dish 
filled with creamed chicken, set in the 
middle of a large silver tray. Around 
the dish, on a bed of crisp green parsley, 
were a number of jelly-fish. Not the 
flabby, unsavory, inanimate kind found 
in the sea, but dear little fishes of 
jelly. It was a tarragon-flavored aspic 
moulded in fish forms, and there were 
several of them. 

After this there was a salad of salmon

mayonnaise, — for this was a fish sup- 
per, — prettily arranged on leaves of 
lettuce; and it was garnished with 
strips of green pepper and bits of red 
pimento. With this was passed a 
log cabin of cream cheese and a log 
cabin of imperial bread sticks. 

The sweets were fish also, which 
seems to be a paradox. They were 
individual moulds of pistachio ice-cream 
in fish-shape, with a serving of snow- 
ball cakes. The latter were white 
cake cut into balls and dipped in 
cocoanut frosting, — ticklish things to 
make, too, as every one knows who 
has attempted them. 

The usual demi-tasse finished this 
unique but most delicious repast, al- 
though the coffee was just a bit out 



of the ordinary. Our hostess called 
it spiced coffee, and we secured the 
secret of its making. First a pot of 
strong drip coffee was made. Then a 
half cupful of brandy and half that 
amount of pure alcohol was put into 
a silver bowl, — a salad bowl. A lighted 
match was applied, and while it was 
burning half a dozen cubes of sugar 
were dropped in one by one. This was 
then stirred with a long-handled ladle, 
and as soon as the flame extinguished 
itself the hot coffee was poured in. 
The hostess then filled the small cups, 
and it was served at once without 
cream or sugar. It was a witchery 
ending, although the finish was yet to 
come in the diminutive course of iced 
creme de menthe.

The Woman Errant. By the author 
of a "Garden of aComrauter's Wife." 
Illustrated. Cloth. $1.50. New 
York: The Macmillan Company. 
This is less of a garden book and more 
of a novel than the author's other books, 
and it is no less attractive. The theme 
is the challenge "of the woman domes- 
tic by the woman errant." Barbara, 
Evan, and the twins reappear, with sev- 
eral young women, who break the home 
ties and enter professional life for the 
sake of matching their brains against 
men's, and for the sport of it. The 
heroine, a brilliant girl, becomes "con- 
fidential secretary to a man in high 
position in the professional world; and 
the results to him, in drawing him un- 
consciously away from his home, to 
herself, in developing her brain at the 
expense of her heart, and to her sweet- 
heart, form an interesting part of the 
new story." Like its predecessors, it 
is a charming volume, and will prove 
to be delightful summer reading. 



How To do Bead-work. By Mary 
White. Cloth. Illustrated. Price 
90 cents, net. New York : Doubleday, 
Page & Co. 

Miss White has hit the new idea as 
aptly in this book as she did in her 
basket books. The many fascinating 
branches of the craft and the remark- 
able effects achieved by the Indian 
workers are explained with simple, prac- 
tical effectiveness and helpful illustra- 
tions. 

That bead-work has decorative possi- 



bilities is evidenced by the many useful 
and ornamental articles in which it ap- 
pears. This book describes and illus- 
trates in detail just how to do the work. 
For children, even mature children, it 
points the way to hours of pleasant 
and profitable occupation. 



Poems that Every Child should 
Know. By Mary E. Burt. Cloth. 
Illustrated. 90 cents net. New 
York: Doubleday, Page & Co. 
The poems of our childhood! They 
are nearly all here, and combined in 
one single, convenient and attractive 
volume. Children cannot be inspired to 
memorize too many poems. The habit 
should be earnestly cultivated in school 
and at home. It leads to good read- 
ing, excellent results in voice culture, 
and it is a source of endless comfort 
and delight. 

In the words of the editor: "Children 
should build for their future, and get, 
while they are children, what only the 
fresh imagination of the child can as- 
similate. They should store up an un- 
told wealth of heroic sentiment; they 
should acquire the habit of carrying a 
literary quality in their conversation; 
they should carry a heart full of the 
fresh and delightful associations and 
memories connected with poetry hours, 
to brighten mature years. They should 
develop their memories while they have 
memories to develop." Commendable, 
indeed, is this volume. It should find 
a permanent place in children's litera- 
ture.

Fair Folks 

Don't blame Nature, but investigate 

Many claim they are nervous "by 
nature," when it is really only because 
they are slaves to the coffee or tea 
habit ; and this 'is easily proved by cut- 



ting out the coffee or tea for ten 
days and using well- boiled Postum 
Food Coffee instead. Then comes the 
change. 

"I seemed endowed by nature with 
a nervous constitution," says a lady of 
Knoxville, Tenn., "and, although I felt 
tea and coffee were bad for me, the 
force of habit was so strong I just 
couldn't give them up. 

"Some one suggested that I try 
cereal coffee; but I remembered what 
insipid drinks we used under that name 
during the Civil War, and so, without 
ever looking into the subject or realiz- 
ing what progress science has made in 
this direction, I just wouldn't give 
Postum a trial, until, finally, the W. C. 
T. U. in our city started an exchange 
where there were so many calls for 
Postum it was served regularly, and 
many were thus induced to try it, my- 
self among the number. How de- 
lighted I was to find it so agreeable, 
delicious, and satisfying. As I had 
suffered from nervous prostration, a 
change from tea and coffee was im- 
perative; but all these troubles disap- 
peared after I had used the Postum 
faithfully for a few weeks. 

"A sister and a son-in-law were con- 
verted to Postum at the same time, 
and now we all enjoy it as well as we 
ever did coffee; but, instead of making 
us nervous like coffee, we enjoy steady 
nerves, sleep sound, and are in every 
way better for the change." Name 
given by Postum Company, Battle 
Creek, Mich. 

This lady found what she thought 
was natural nervousness was only due 
to an acquired taste for coffee, which is, 
to some people, a sure destroyer of 
nerves and health. Like her, any one 
who cuts off coffee altogether and uses 
well-boiled Postum in its place will be 
greatly benefited after a few days, and 
the rettyn to health is a joyful journey. 

There's a reason.

o' Cakes 



" Land o' Cakes " is a name frequently given to 
Scotland where meal cakes form an import- 
ant article of diet. The phrase was made 
famous by Robert Burns in 1789, in his poem 
On Captain Grose s Peregrinations through Scot- 
land, which commences with the following lines : 

" Hear, " La'td-o- 'Cakes" an' brither Scots,

America as the Land of Biscuit, for in the past

The Late Sir Henry Thompson 

Sir Henry Thompson, Bart., who 
died on April 19 at the ripe age of eighty- 
four, was one of the greatest living 
authorities on the question of food and 
feeding. He was a stanch supporter 
of the Universal Cookery and Food 
Association, who will miss his genial 
and ever-ready help most keenly. Sir 
Henry was a great epicure, and took 
an immense pride in compiling his 
menus. He knew the principles of 
the art of cookery and food, and de- 
voted much study to the subject of 
cookery and the art of dining wisely 
and well. He was a man of temper- 
ate habits, and of late years a total 
abstainer. He strongly advocated 
moderation in eating, and above all 
moderation in drinking alcoholic bev- 
erages. 

The late Sir Henry Thompson, than 
whom few men have devoted more time 
to the study of diet in mankind, was 
an outspoken opponent of hard-and- 
fast vegetarianism. He held that man 
was not intended to live on fruits, nuts, 
or other forms of vegetables alone. 
To him physiology pointed quite the 
other way. Science and experience 
showed, he said, that man ought to 
live on a mixed diet, if he wished to do 
good work and live healthily. The 
great secret, according to Sir Henry, 
was moderation in all things; and he 
did not consider a devotion to vege- 
tables alone could be called modera- 
tion. 

A crank recently wrote to Andrew 
Carnegie, suggesting that he should 
send a fleet of coaling ships to the Es- 
quimaux, who cannot advance morally 
and intellectually till they can keep 
themselves warm. He received the 
following letter in reply: "Dear Sir, — 
I am considering a plan to supply the 
natives of Equatorial Africa with ice- 
cream and electric fans, hence I can- 
not entertain your excellent proposi- 
tion just now." — Christian Register. 



Race Done? 

Not a Bit of It 

A man who thought his race was run 
made a food find that brought him back 
to perfect health. 

"One year ago I was unable to per- 
form any labor, — in fact, I was told by 
my physicians that they could do noth- 
ing further for me. I was fast sinking 
away, for an attack of grip had left my 
stomach so weak it could not digest 
any food sufficient to keep me alive. 

"There I was just wasting away, 
growing thinner every day and weaker, 
really being snuffed out simply because 
I could not get any nourishment from 
food. 

"Then my sister got after me to try 
Grape-nuts food, which had done much 
good for her; and she finally persuaded 
me, and, although no other food had 
done me the least bit of good, my 
stomach handled the Grape-nuts from 
the first, and this food supplied the 
nourishment I had needed. In three 
months I was so strong I moved from 
Albany to San Francisco, and now on 
my three meals of Grape-nuts and 
cream every day I am strong and vig- 
orous, and do fifteen hours work. I 
believe the sickest person in the world 
could do as I do, eat three meals 
of nothing but Grape-nuts and cream, 
and soon be on their feet again in the 
flush of best health like me. 

"Not only am I in perfect physical 
health again, but my brain is stronger 
and clearer than it ever was on the old 
diet. I hope you will write to the 
names I send you about Grape-nuts, for 
I want to see my friends well and strong. 

"Just think that a year ago I was 
dying, but to-day, although I am over 
fifty-five years of age, most people take 
me to be less than forty; and I feel 
just as young as I look." Name given 
by Postum Company, Battle Creek, 
Mich. 

There's a reason. 

Look for the little book, "The Road 
to Wellville," in each package.

Household Hints 



Ten Commandments for the 

Home-maker 

i. Make your household one har- 
monious whole, no matter how small 
the scale. 

2. Use only what you can comfort- 
ably afford in good quality and ample 
quantity. 

3. Let your home appear bright and 
sunny. It is not easy to be unpleasant 
in a cheerful room. 

4. Treat your servants wisely and 
kindly, and it will be impossible for 
them to either impose or oppose. 

5. Have time for everything, and be 
never in a hurry. 

6. A certain formality is necessary 
to save every-day life from triviality, 
and freedom from looseness. 

7. Do not forget that "society" is 
the death of home life, hospitality its 
flower. 

8. Know how to talk and how to 
listen, how to entertain and how to 
amuse. 

9. Have many interests and no 
studies. 

10. Do not forget — your home should 
not only be a well-conducted dormi- 
tory and boarding-place, but truly a 
home, the centre and focus of all in- 
terest, pleasure, and happiness for 
everybody connected with it. 



The cooking of rice is an art which 
has not as yet been acquired by all 
cooks. When properly cooked, each 
grain stands firm, dry, and separate 
from its fellows, yet it is as soft as dead 
ripe fruit, and the whole mass is as 
white as snow. 



Mrs. Mary E. Grosh, of Noblesville, 
Ind., after experiments covering a 
period of three years, has succeeded in 
producing seedless tomatoes. They 
grow to about the size of an ordinary 
tomato, and have a delicious flavor, 
similar to that of the English hothouse 
variety. 



Hard Soap, Cold Process 

Dissolve two pounds of caustic soda 
powder in a jar or earthen vessel in 
nine pints or pounds of cold water. 
Stir with a wooden spoon or stick 
while dissolving. The liquid will be- 
come very hot. Do not use it until it 
becomes cold. Weigh out fifteen pounds 
of clean grease, tallow or oil. Let melt 
slowly. The temperature of the grease 
should not be raised higher than ioo° 
Fahr. (oil requires no heating). Pour 
the caustic soda-powder preparation in 
a small stream into the liquid grease, 
stirring all the time with a wooden 
paddle or piece of stick, until the 
mixture is of the consistency of honey. 
It will take about fifteen minutes. 
Pour at once into wooden boxes or 
pans dampened with water. Set aside 
in a warm place. The next day it 
may be cut into cakes. We have 
not at hand a reliable recipe for soft 
soap. 

A sandwich which always brings 
praise is made of Neufchatel or cream 
cheese and English walnuts, and is 
known as the walnut sandwich. But- 
ter the bread lightly, then spread over 
each slice a layer of cheese about an 
eighth of an inch thick, then a thick 
layer of nuts cut into pieces of about 
a quarter of an inch in length. Sprinkle 
lightly with salt before putting the 
slices together.

Household Hints 



Mr. Fastidious and his Happy- 
go-lucky Wife 

"What I want to know is," said the 
Fastidious Man, "why sometimes the 
sliced tomatoes are firm and right, and 
other times they are either ragged and 
sloppy or else tough and hard?" 

"It all depends on the tomato," said 
the Happy-go-lucky Wife, severely 
eying the youngest to prevent him 
taking too large mouthfuls. 

"I can't think that," said the Fas- 
tidious Man, frowning at a stingy salt- 
shaker. "I believe you let them soak 
too long." 

"Soak too long?" echoed Mrs. Easy- 
going in some surprise. 

"Yes, — in hot water," said Mr. Fas- 
tidious. "Now why don't you just 
pare them, as you would an apple?" 

"Try it," murmured the wife. 

"Very well," said Mr. Fastidious, 
promptly. "Ring the bell, and let the 
domestic bring one in." 

Mrs. Easy-going complied, but looked 
at the penknife which Mr. Fastidious 
produced with discomposure. For she 
knew that knife was much sharper than 
any of her kitchen weapons. 

"Bring Mr. Fastidious a tomato," she 
commanded, and the maid looked into 
her bright eyes with comprehension. 

The tomato was brought, and very 
innocent it looked as it lay upon the 
plate, but Mrs. E. G. knew it was soft 
and treacherous. 

"This soaking tomatoes in hot water 
ruins them," said Mr. Fastidious, pick- 
ing up the vegetable gingerly and run- 
ning his knife into its middle at the 
outset. 

"I think so, too," said the meek wife, 
"but you will have the skin off." 

"Certainly I will, my dear," said 
Mr. Fastidious, as he cut off a chunk a 
quarter of an inch thick and frowned 
with annoyance. "The skin is neither 
good nor digestible." 

"I think it is good," murmured the 
wife, and tried not to smile as she saw 
tomato juice running up his arm. 



Warn tm writ* »dy ertiaura, plane mention Tub Boero* CoauM-Maeoi. hUaunrB. 



Mr. Fastidious made an effort to 
pare it thinner, but that seemed an 
impossibility. The tomato was rapidly 
losing shape and consistency. 

"It takes a sharp knife," said Mr. 
Fastidious, as he cut his thumb slightly, 
"and a deft touch to pare a tomato " — 

About now it slipped out of his hand 
and landed in the gravy. 

"Ring the bell," said Mr. Fastidious, 
wiping blood and tomato juice on his 
napkin, "and let the domestic remove 
this — er — tomato. " 

Mrs. Easy-going rang the bell. 

"Remove the — er — tomato," she 
commanded. 

The canny domestic glanced around 
the table and picked up the plate with 
the chunks and slivers of tomato upon 
it. 

"The-gravy bowl," suggested the 
meek wife, with serious face and frown- 
ing at the four-year-old who was on 
the verge of laughter. 

"Let me help you to some meat, 
Laura," said Mr. Fastidious, politely. 

"A small piece, please," murmured 
the wife.

Woman's Work in Korea 
As there are no labor-saving ma- 
chines in Korea, women's work is done 
by the crudest methods possible, from 
hulling rice with a heavy wood or stone 
pestle to washing clothes by beating 
them in the streams and ironing them 
with sticks. In order to iron, the 
clothes- must always be ripped apart 
and wrapped around a wooden roller 
while damp. They are then beaten 
by either one or two women. It is 
surprising to see the gloss on the white 
calico and the sheen upon the linen 
produced by this method of ironing: 
it surpasses the dressing one sees in 
this country on newly bought linen. 
Since the people dress exclusively in 
white, the woman's day — and often 
much of the night, too — is spent in 
washing, ironing, and sewing. — St. 
James Gazelle. 

One day a fussy creature met the 
famous Father Healy, of Dublin, by 
the seashore, and thus accosted him: 
"Father Healy, I'm undergoing a cure, 
and I take a tumbler of sea water three 
tunes a day. Now I've had my full 
allowance to-day; but do you think I 
might have one, just one, tumbler 
more?" Father Healy put his head 
on one side and looked at the ocean, 
lost in thought. "Well," he said at 
last, with a gravely judicial air, "I 
don't think it would be missed." 



When Fanny Kemble spent her 
summers in Massachusetts, she en- 
gaged a neighbor to drive her regularly 
about the country. On their first 
excursion he began to discuss the crops 
and the history of the people, when 
Mrs. Kemble said in her dramatic 
fashion, "Sir, I have engaged you to 
drive, not talk." The farmer kept 
his peace, and, when the vacation was 
over, sent in his bill. "What is this 
item, sir?" she asked. "I do not 
understand it." With equal gravity 
he rejoined : "Sass, five dollars. I 
don't often take it; but, when I do, 
I charge!" The bill was paid, and it 
made a firm friend of Mrs. Kemble 
ever after. — Christian Register. 



In Mosquito Time 
A little Cleveland tot of three years 
was put to bed, her first night in New 
Jersey, by her mother, with the words, 
"Now go to sleep, darling, and remem- 
ber the angels are flying about your 
little crib and keeping you from harm." 
A few minutes later the patter of little 
feet was heard, and a little white- 
robed figure emerged from the bed- 
room. "Why, darling, what's the mat- 
ter?" said the mother. "I don't like 
the angels," sobbed the little girl. 
"Why, dearie, why not?" "One o' 
th' angels bit me." — School Board 
Journal.

Jack and Jill 
Jill, or Gill, is an abbreviation of the 
once feminine name Gillian, or Juliana. 
In Icelandic mythology Jack and Gill 
are two children kidnapped by the 
moon while drawing water, which is 
carried on their shoulders in a bucket 
suspended from a pole. The Swedish 
peasants still account for the moon 
spots in this way. A play with the 
title "Jack and Jill" was popular at 
the English court between 1567 and 
1578. How far back the English nur- 
sery rhyme with this title dates is not 
known, though every school child is 
familiar with the lilies. 

A seven-year-old boy didn't know 
his lesson, and raised his hand. "What 
is it, Jamie?" "I must go home with 
a headache." The teacher said, "Oh, 
I wouldn't go now!" And Jamie went 
back to his seat. Soon his hand was 
raised again. "My tooth aches so bad 
I can't stay a moment longer," he said. 
The teacher looked at his teeth, found 
them in remarkably fine condition, as- 
sured him the pain was imaginary, and 
went back. She had just become ab- 
sorbed, when a wail from Jamie's seat 
caused her to say rather impatiently, 
"What is it this time, Jamie?" With 
tears in his eyes, Jamie answered, "It's 
the stomach-ache, and my stomach's 
so far down that you can't see it."

A Mecca for Pleasure-Seekers 
Atlantic City is a place of a thousand, 
inasmuch as its make-up, especially in 
Ihc summer, is that of fun and gayety. 
There ts everything the occasion might 
demand at the famous resort, and for a 
good time it cannot be beat. There is 
always fun on the board walk and piers, 
and the bathing is unequalled. The 
boating or sailing facilities are the best, 
and, no matter which way you turn, 
there is something doing. The hotels, 
numbering more than 200, are marvels 
as hostelries, and the typical "Boni- 
face" is ever present. Each hotel is 
complete to the minutest detail, and 
grill-rooms, rathskellers, palm gardens, 
sun parlors, music halls, and the like 
are features at each house. Atlantic 
City is decidedly accessible because of 
the excellent train service furnished by 
the New Jersey Central from New York. 
Fast trains leave station, foot of Liberty 
Street, at 9.40 a.m. and 3.40 p.m., mak- 
ing the run in three hours and passing 
through the famous resort, Lakewood. 
With the famed seashore resort at its 
height, there is no reason why every- 
body who goes there should not have 
a good time. If you want a time 
table, write to C. M. Burt, General 
Passenger Agent, New Jersey Central, 
New York City.

About Toilet Powders 

With a toilet powder, as with al- 
most everything else, it is essential to 
be sure that you get an article of real 
merit. 

Highly scented powders are danger- 
ous and often do permanent injury to 
a delicate skin. 

Mennen's Toilet Powder is a trade- 
marked article, which has for years 
been recognized by physicians as the 
best preparation made. The absolute 
purity of its ingredients and the ex- 
ercise of the greatest care and skill in 
its manufacture have given the prod- 
uct of the Mennen Company a quality 
of uniform excellence. That is why 
your physician recommends it. 

Inferior goods often cost you the 
same money, while they yield a larger 
profit to the dealer. For this reason 
dealers will often attempt to force 
other goods upon you. 

For your protection, Mennen's face, 
the trade-mark of the Mennen Com- 
pany, is on the cover of every box of 
the genuine. It will be worth your 
while to look for this trade-mark. 

All first-class dealers carry Mennen's 
Toilet Powder.

SILVER POPLARS 

A perfect day, within a month of days ! 

I walk alone amid the leafy ways ; 

I hear the music which the wandering breeze 

Makes in the branches of the poplar-trees. 

A fairy vision seem they to my view, 

All green and silver on a field of blue ! 

In wintry hours oft shall return to me 
That beauteous scene, that elfin minstrelsy. 
Again, as now, shall I with rapture hear 
That murmur musical with inward ear, 
With inward sight shall I again espy 
That tracing fair upon the azure sky. 

Happy the soul to whom the gods have sent 

The gift which brings perennial content ! 

He sees, when summer's scorching winds do blow, 

The silver moonlight falling on the snow ; 

He hears, when winter sends his chilling breeze, 

Summer's sweet music in the rustling trees !

Japanese Tea-houses and Gardens 



By Jessie Juliet Knox 



TO describe one Japanese tea- 
house is not to describe all; 
for they range from the large 
three-storied structures, resplendent 
with flags and lanterns, seen in cities 
and at pleasure resorts, and which are 
patronized by the aristocrats of Mikado 
land, to the chaya of the roadside, and 
the regular "dive" variety, under the 
eaves of which are rude, wooden 
benches, where the coolies may rest. 

In Japan, the land of tea, there are 
tea-houses everywhere. The love of 
the beautiful is so intense in Japanese 
people that they carry it out in all 
things, and perhaps more in gardens 
and tea-houses than elsewhere. They 
build a tea-house wherever they find 
a point from which a picturesque view 
may be obtained; and from its cosey 
recesses and gardens one may contin- 
ually feast the eye upon the beautiful 
in nature. No words can describe 
the beauties of some of these gardens. 
Everything is in miniature; and mani- 
fold and unexpected charms unfold 
at every step. There are all kinds of 
surprises, in which art has assisted 
nature; and one can but admire the 
infinite pains taken to convert the 
ordinary into the unique. Many wind- 
ing borders are made of tea plants, 
which are kept well clipped. Shrubs 
and trees have been trained to rep- 



resent umbrellas, boats, houses, men 
with hats, cats, storks, and tortoises. 
Tiny arbors and gravelled walks lose 
themselves in the shadow of trees. 

Great stone lamps stand here and 
there in the gardens; and queer idols, 
gargoyles, etc., appear in the most 
unexpected places. But perhaps the 
most noticeable feature, and one com- 
mon to all tea-gardens, is the number 
and peculiarity of the pines, which 
have been dwarfed by dexterous opera 1 
tions, and make the garden seem a 
place fit only for elves and gnomes. 

Tiny lakes and rivulets adorn the 
scene, and small rustic bridges span 
silver streams, while Japanese rain- 
bow bridges are frequent. Mysteri- 
ous and winding paths are hemmed 
in by dwarfed trees and shrubs. The 
baby trees are as perfect in every de- 
tail as if they had grown unfettered 
to full stature; and this seems strange; 
since so many of them are growing 
only in shallow porcelain dishes. The 
exquisite Japanese iris, in royal robes 
of purple, rears its stately head in 
these gardens. It is the flower which, 
under their deft brown fingers, ap- 
pears often in their embroidery. 

Everywhere are ponds, covered with 
the waxen leaves and blossoms of the 
lotus, famed in Oriental lore. Bright 
awnings light up the scene by day; 



126 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



and at night strings of picturesque 
Japanese lanterns glow everywhere, 
illuminating the dark places and mak- 
ing the elf garden seem more than 
ever like fairyland. 

All things perfect in detail blend 
in exquisite harmony. Not only is 
nature beautiful in these places, but 
the human element, also, is prevalent. 
Pretty Geisha girls smile from pict- 
uresque balconies ; and, when one enters 
a tea-house, these girls are all atten- 
tion, and one is cared for in the most 
charming manner. They bring you 
tea or what other refreshments you 
may desire, talking pretty nonsense 
the while, smiling and giggling; for 
laughter is so natural to the Japanese 
girl, she flourishes on it, and is pleased 
to indulge in it at the very least excuse. 

At the finer tea-houses the Geisha, 
or singing girls, serve tea and sake, 
and also dance, sing, and play the 
samisen for the delectation of the 
guests. All tea-house girls smoke long 



bamboo pipes after meals, and then 
offer them to the guests for a whiff. 
Even the ordinary tea-houses by the 
roadside have sweetmeats, dried fish, 
pickles, mochi, and dried persimmons. 
That they, also, have rice and tea 
goes without saying. 

These chayas have floors about eigh- 
teen inches from the ground ; and often 
there is a matted platform in the house, 
and a recess called the doma, or earth- 
space, in the centre. Circling this is 
a ledge of wood ; and on this travelers 
sit while bathing their feet in water. 
which is always brought at once to 
them for that purpose. In Japan no 
one is allowed to step on the floor 
matting until his foreign shoes have 
been removed, the feet washed, and 
comfortable and clean sandals donned. 
The kitchen is on one side of the room ; 
and here the coolies may rest on the 
mats while eating and smoking, and. 
on the other side, the family go about 
their duties. 



Geisha Girls 



Japanese Tea-houses and Gardens 



Artificial Lakei and Rockeries 



In the most unpretentious tea-houses 
are one or two rooms at the back; 
but everything of interest goes on at 
the front of the place. In the less 
pretentious tea-houses there is only 
an iron, a square hole in the floor 
filled with sand, on which are placed 
the charcoal for cooking purposes, 
little racks for food, and the utensils 
used in eating. In the larger tea- 
houses there is a row of charcoal stoves, 
and shelves reaching to the roof. 
These are filled with lacquer tables, 
and lacquer and chinaware, used by 
the guests. Either many small rooms 
or one very large room may be found 
in the more extensive tea-houses. No 
nails are used, only sliding panels in 
grooves in floor and ceiling. 

Upon stopping at one of these way- 
side chayas, the ' 'runners," or men 
who draw the jinrikiskas , bathe their 
feet, rinse their mouths, and partake 
eagerly of a meal consisting of rice, 



pickle, salt fish, broth, and tea, after 
which they smoke and drink sake. 

When a guest enters a tea-house, 
he is met by a pretty and smiling girl, 
who brings him a lacquer tray, with 
bamboo or china charcoal -holder and 
ash-pot, while another brings a zen. 
This is a tiny lacquer table, only six 
inches high (as the Japanese sit on 
the floor to eat, there is no need of 
a higher table). This tray contains 
also a tiny teapot, which holds about 
one teacupful, also two cups without 
handles, holding from ten to twenty 
thimblefuls, each. The variety of eat- 
ables to be had is endless; but, un- 
fortunately, very few of them can be 
tolerated by one not accustomed to 
them. There is always kept a large 
pail of cooked rice; but hot rice is 
served only three times a day. The 
coolies heat this cold rice by pouring 
hot tea over it. 

While you are eating, the tea-house 



128 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



girl sits on a mat beside you, carefully 
supplying all your wants, keeping your 
rice-bowl and teacup well filled, until 
you declare you can take no more. 

After the substantials, there are 
cake and confections of all kinds, and 
smoking for all who desire. 

To a foreign taste the tea is the 
best part of it all; for Japanese tea, 
as brewed by the Japanese, is a nectar 
not to be resisted. The leaves are 
pounded to a powder; and hot water, 
not boiling, is poured on, and allowed 
to stand only for a moment, ' when 
boiling water is added. The pinch 
of tea is placed in your cup, and the 
water is poured into the cup. The 
liquid is straw-colored, of exquisite 
aroma and flavor, and always grateful 
and refreshing. No milk or sugar is 
used, and one soon comes to like it this 
way; for, if it stands, it becomes bitter. 

Tea-drinking is an ancient rite in 
Japan. It was introduced by an em- 
peror who reigned four hundred years 
ago, and who did not consider turmoil 
good for the country, so he introduced 
what is known as the "tea ceremony," 



or Cha-no-yu. He insisted on men 
attending the tea-houses, and culti- 
vating quiet and meditation rather 
than a warlike spirit; and he had the 
tea-houses made very beautiful so as 
to attract people. They were rilled 
with all kinds of rich and artistic 
things and the rarest of plants and 
flowers. It was, perhaps, by this 
means that the Japanese acquired that 
trait of gentleness and courtesy which 
is now their strong characteristic. 

At a ''tea ceremony" it is consid- 
ered bad form to ' 'talk shop," or 
indulge in loud laughing or talking, 
the idea being to snatch a few quiet 
moments from the busy day. The 
tea rites, however, have passed through 
many changes; for at times they are 
marked by license and luxury. 

The custom of the Buddhist monks 
of the Zen sect was to make a strong 
decoction of the powdered tea-leaves, 
and drink it, in order to keep awake 
for the midnight mass. A scene from 
"the Arabian Nights" could not have 
been more gorgeous than a tea-party 
in the sixteenth century, so rich and

extravagant was the decoration of 
the rooms where it was held. The 
princes lay on couches covered with 
the rarest tiger skins and the richest 
silks, while attendants burned price- 
less perfumes. Rich brocades hung 
from the walls; and fine paintings on 
panels of silk adorned the place. After 
a light meal of expensive dainties, 
the real feast was served. The prin- 
cipal feature was tasting the many 
varieties of tea ; and the one who could 
distinguish and tell c5orrectly the names 
of all the different varieties was given 
anything in the room which he might 
select. Then rare trophies were given 
to the Geisha girls, who had furnished 
entertainment for the guests. At this 
time the revels were almost Bacchanal- 
ian. The tea drunk at these functions 
is almost a gruel, thick and green, and 



very bitter. The bowl is passed from 
one to another, each taking just a sip, 
until it is all gone ; for, if a drop should 
be left in the bowl, it would be an in- 
sult to the host. 

Another feature of the higher class 
tea-gardens is the tea-garden opera, 
given by troupes of professional singers 
and musicians. There is nothing but 
a stand for the music, and from this 
readings are given, accompanied by 
the music of the samisen and other 
instruments. 

All is full of charm to the guest, be 
he Japanese or foreigner. The audi- 
ence dressed in gay silks, the pict- 
uresque rows of paper lanterns, sway- 
ing in the night air and shedding a 
soft, mellow light through the trees, 
combine to render the picture perfect, 
and one never to be forgotten.

After Graduation What? 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



WITH October begins another 
school year to blossom into 
next summer's graduation. 
But before that frenzied period arrives, 
when one can do naught but be caught 
in the modern tendency to publicity, 
one may calmly wonder about this 
annual hustle for a career for fame and 
its tortuous effort for self-support. 

All down the line, from professional 
to grammar schools, extends the grad- 
uate excitement. Yet no anxious 
mother, wearied by the economies and 
claims of a graduation dress, or no 
laboring father, who reckons on the 
market value of his child's education, 
would forego the intense gratification 
afforded parental pride by seeing its 
child descend from school or college 
platform, diploma in hand. 

It is as natural as inevitable that 
parents and children should mark the 
successive periods of attainment; but 
still the question presses, Is the man- 
ner of recognition thereof wise? Are 
flowers and collations necessary for 
public, civic graduations ? 

Mothers sit up at night sewing on the 
tucked-and-shirred, white graduation 
dresses of their daughters, and fathers 
work over time for the sake of the 
beads they wear and the flowers which 
are handed to them on receiving their 
diplomas. At one grammar school a 
large, low platform was entirely cov- 
ered with the waiting bouquets ; and the 
mothers, in their well-worn habiliments, 
their gray hair and roughened hands, 
stood on tiptoe, with pathetic, fond 
pride, to see which girl had the biggest 
bouquet. The mother-heart made all of 
one kin. But still rushed the question, 
Do children themselves realize the stress 
of circumstances that have been sur- 
mounted to keep them at school ? Al- 



though no parent has a right, legal or 
moral, to deprive his child of at least 
the full extent of a grammar-school 
education. 

But cannot the observance of gradu- 
ations be made simpler? Are flowers 
and collations — for cities often furnish 
both wholesale — necessary for gradua- 
tions ? Should they be a legitimate part 
of the expense of public-school educa- 
tion ? Could not the cost of them more 
wisely be applied to meagre salaries of 
teachers and to equipment of school- 
rooms? Still more, when cities or 
towns spend money for such transitory 
pleasures as flowers, lemonade, and cake, 
do they not foster in the minds of the 
graduates a notion that the city owes 
them a good time and a livelihood as 
well as an education ? And though the 
striving to complete a grammar-school 
course is as honorable as the ambition to 
attain unto a high-school or college ca- 
reer, yet is not education somewhat 
cheapened by attaching too much civic 
publicity to early graduations? 

Let there be diplomas, speeches, and 
congratulations; but why need there be 
such dressy dresses and floral offerings ? 
Many a girl, who cannot afford a new 
dress, feels ashamed when she has not 
one, and would rather have her diploma 
mailed to her than face an audience in 
her print gown. Still more does the 
girl without the bouquet bewail her for- 
lornness, when the much -applauded 
schoolmate on either side of her has one. 
To the pupils the bouquets hint at the 
favoritism of the boys, who, though the 
flowers may be given by parents, clap 
loud and long for some girls and feebly 
and briefly for others. If the girlish sad- 
ness is due to false pride, yet it is human 
nature, easily understood and pardoned. 

From the civic point of view one can

also easily understand how public grad- 
uations are presumed to develop patri- 
otism. Probably, if there were no public 
ceremonies, there might be less public 
spirit; and yet one wonders if the 
"know-it-all" tone of our boys and girls 
may not be heightened by the attentions 
bestowed upon them at very youthful 
graduations. Certainly, in their vale- 
dictories the frankness of their advice 
to their elders and their announcements 
of what they are to be to the world is 
amusing. They know it all. 

Yet it is not grammar nor high-school 
nor college graduates who are chiefly re- 
sponsible for graduation ceremonies, but 
school committees, teachers, and espe- 
cially parents, who for years have stim- 
ulated their children's ambitions and 
cravings for renown. Each new fad or 
1 'value" in education has been caught 
on to by parental ambition, which, be- 
cause a boy does well in mechanical 
drawing in the eighth grade, sees in him 
an architect of fame, or, because a girl 
has made a book-cover for the list of 



spelling words, thinks she will become 
an artist. Even arts and crafts foster 
ambitious delusions. The hammering 
out of a copper bowl or the stippling on a 
leather belt prophesies to the parent a 
successful career. Parents are so much 
more unwilling than their children to 
believe that average ability is the rule, 
since it is so disappointing to be a dis- 
appointed fond parent. 

Parental ambitions have penetrated 
so deep into the substance of graduating 
addresses that it is only within the last 
year or two that hopeful signs are ap- 
pearing, which indicate that emphases 
are changing. Speakers are no longer 
merely eloquent or heavily advisory. 
They often give just homely "heart-to- 
heart 11 talks that put audiences, pupils, 
and teachers mentally in each other's 
places, until each one feels as if every 
one else understood him, and he in turn 
comprehended everybody. Boys and 
girls alike are now bidden to improve 



themselves for the sake of the state and 
the home rather than for that of per- 
sonal ambition. Exhilarating exhorta- 
tions are.no longer delivered upon the 
latent possibility of each boy to be 
President, but upon his hidden pro- 
clivities to farming, business, or me- 
chanical work. 

A girl may be advised to enter upon 
some form of "social service" (the 
phrase now so much in vogue), as if it 
offered a more beguiling career than just 
being useful at home, with parents and 
townspeople, whom one has always 
known and with whom there cannot be 
such varying excitement as in college 
settlement and philanthropic work. But, 
fortunately, a new emphasis upon self- 
improvement for the sake of home has 
been greatly aided by the establishment 
of special and technical schools for house- 
hold arts, since, as such schools give 
diplomas, it is argued that the subjects 
they teach must be worth while. Sew- 
ing and laundry work, but especially 
cooking, have risen into an educational 
prominence that has reacted upon the 
home. Graduates no longer scoff or 
smirk when the speaker of the day talks 
to them about carrying their education 
into their home life, thereby weiring 
themselves more agreeable and useful 
therein. 

Moreover, it is no longer considered 
"bad form/ 9 or derogatory to education, 
to allude to the advantages of wejl-bred 
manners and pretty dressing, provided 
it has the beauty of simplicity. It has 
even .become allowable to hint at mar- 
riage as a desirable outcome of educa- 
tion, and to intimate to boys and girls 
that homes of their own making are 
worth living for as well as careers. 

Yet with this new emphasis upon 
home and social service might be 
coupled, also, in graduating addresses 
insistence upon respect for a constitu- 
tion and its by-laws and — for abstract 
law, lest pupils cheat themselves with 
opportunism on behalf of what is called 



An International Episode

•'collective welfare," and indulge in 
bossism and in sinuous ways of getting 
what they want. 

Perhaps, after all, one might learn 
more of what should or should not con- 
stitute a speaker's emphasis from chil- 
dren themselves. At least, so thought 
some teachers, one of whom asked her 
class what each wanted to be. One 
said a dressmaker, another a teacher. 
A third child drew a picture of a girl 
with a long line attached to a boy, 
saying, "I want to catch a feller." 
And a little maiden who was going to 
graduate answered, ' 'I want to have an 
orphan asylum or be a mother." Her 
noble honesty made her diploma well 
deserved. 



Another teacher questioned a group 
of society graduates, who were trying 
to define education. Said one of them 
in pragmatic manner, "It is an avenue 
to self-support." Another jubilantly 
replied, "It is the making the most of 
myself," adding after a pause, "for the 
sake of others, — or of society. You 
know they are not just the same." But 
a madonna-faced girl quoted, — 

"Only one wage Love ever asked, — 
A child's white face to kiss at night." 

After graduation, What ? Home and 
love; contentment and endeavor; the 
making of any one graduation, even 
that of Resolve completed in Work, into 
preparation for the next graduation. 



An International Episode 

By Helen Campbell 




MERICAN dishes? I have to 
insist that they have hardly the 
right to that name," said an 
excited Englishman at a little dinner 
not long ago. "I have observed care- 
fully, and should say that whatever 
you have is borrowed, or transplanted, 
if you prefer that word. You were all 
emigrants, as must be true of any new 
country; and an emigrant holds hard 
to all that reminds him of home. Now, 
for example, take Canada. I'm just 
from there, and proved it again. You 
here in the States have assimilated 
some things, as a result of your immense 
foreign population; but the 'Virginia 
Cook Book/ for instance, or any other 
dating back to your colonial period, 
is merely duplicate of our first author- 
ities, from Mrs. Glasse to Mrs. Beaton." 
11 Oh, I say, pater" his son began, 
a big, very blond young Englishman on 
his way to Colorado via Boston and a 



round of lunches and dinners. The 
father nodded with a decisive wave of 
the hand, indicating that the floor at 
present could have no other claimant; 
and the son with a rather aggrieved 
look turned again to the charming 
American girl at his side. 

"Really, you know that is one of 
his specialties, — a kind of omniscience 
in him that includes cookery," he 
murmured apologetically. "I wish it 
didn't," he added, as the deep bass 
voice rumbled on, his host listening 
courteously, but with a little twinkle 
in his friendly blue eyes that indicated 
his turn was waiting and held full re- 
prisals. "Green corn, of course," the 
guest proceeded, "is new to me; but 
it does not come under the head of 
'dish.' That implies composition, va- 
ried ingredients; and, when it comes 
to that, I find?none. The very charm- 
ing dinner just ending is the usual 



134 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



menu of a high civilization, French in 
its origin and handling, the corn ears 
excepted, and yet no, since they made 
a course." 

' 'How about succotash, Boston baked 
beans, fish balls, brown bread?" came 
from the end of the table. 

"With succotash I am not personally 
familiar, but know it was borrowed 
from the Indians, — an aboriginal dish, 
and American in that sense only." 

"Then you are doubtless familiar 
with larrup, scouse, duddyfunk, dough- 
god, and" — 

"My dear sir," the Englishman in- 
terrupted, his look of annoyance chang- 
ing to one of sudden interest, as he took 
out a little note-book, "most extraor- 
dinary names, which you will pardon 
my taking down at once, with your 
definitions, if you will. You could not, 
however, call them national," he ended 
protestingly. 

"Only as you find them in every 
lumber camp from Maine to Minnesota. 
Of course, Maine carried them in the 
beginning to Minnesota, since it is 
Maine lumbermen whose axes first 
dealt with the great pines of that 
State. I have followed them from 
the Great Lakes on and up, and have 
found these dishes in every camp. 
And within a day or two I have read 
somewhere that an old lumber-camp 
cook, quarter Indian and three-quarters 
French Canadian, has started, on an 
island near Old town, Me., a sort of 
school for wood cookery, in which he 
is said to be unexcelled by any living 
man, — his name Sabbatis Socabesin, 
and his fame known wherever a lumber 
camp establishes itself. They are all 
epicures after their own fashion, — 
these men, — a limited menu inevitable, 
when you consider the distances that 
must often be traversed; but they de- 
mand the best, and get it, every owner 
of a camp realizing the nature of the 
appetite created by ten hours a day 
of chopping. No lumbermen like the 



American ! We have had to dear a con- 
tinent, you know; and the job is now 
to be done all over again, but in a differ- 
ent way. Forestry is its present name." 

The Englishman shook his head 
impatiently as the hostess rose, and 
at once, as they entered the drawing- 
room, drew the owner of this unrecorded 
knowledge to a quiet corner, proceed- 
ing to take down at once the formulas 
for these mysterious dishes, pausing for 
a moment to say with sudden suspicion: 
"You are perfectly certain these are 
correct." 

"Perfectly. I was cook myself for 
three weeks under Socabesin 's direction, 
and he was a martinet." 

"But how?" the Englishman began, 
then colored slightly and stopped short. 
America was an extraordinary country, 
and that his informant had the look of 
high breeding, no less than his hjost, was 
no guarantee that he had a pedigree or 
cared for one; and, with a little shake of 
the head, he questioned again: "This 
'larrup/ you say. What is that?" 

"A thick porridge, much like Irish 
stirabout, but made with wheat flour 
instead of oatmeal. Our .grandmothers 
in the colonial days called it 'minute 
pudding/ and used milk, or milk and 
water, well salted, stirring in the sifted 
flour, and beating it smooth and free 
from every lump. That is the great 
point in making larrup, which is eaten 
with black molasses, and called for 
not less than once a week. As to 
'scouse/ it is also a hasty pudding, 
made from equal portions of corn and 
rye meal, and eaten with butter and 
molasses, with a trifle of pepper sauce 
to give it character. 'Lobscouse' is 
just a variation, — a slice of scouse cut 
very thin, fried in pork fat, and eaten 
also with butter and molasses. The 
lumberman becomes a connoisseur in 
molasses, and swears at the beans, if 
they have not precisely the flavor the 
right sort gives." 

"Then beans are in Minnesota also? 



Loss or Gain? 



l 3S 



Molasses and beans in connection appear 
totally incongruous/ 1 the Englishman 
said suspiciously. 

"Beans are universal, and of every 
dime, and have been since Pythag- 
oras, and undoubtedly before; and 
baked beans and molasses are insepa- 
rable," his informant said gravely. 
"Socabesin parboils them, puts them 
in an iron pot with a due proportion 
of salt pork, molasses, and salt, and 
buries them in the hot ashes of the 
camp fire for not less than twelve 
hours, — the longer, the better. When 
they come out, each bean has turned 
red and remains whole, but swimming 
in a rich medium, which makes the 
sauce; and these beans they demand 
twice a day surely, three times prefer- 
ably. The other dishes we are deal- 
ing with are mere incidents, but seldom 
the main fact." 

"It is duddy funk that is next in 
order," said the Englishman, after due 
note had been made of the beans; 
"and duddyfunk is—?" 

"Just a very rich pie, made of beef 
first stewed a little, or from venison if 
it is to be had, with strips of fat salt 
pork, pepper, and a little ground clove 
for seasoning, and as rich a crust as 
the camp supplies admit, — a dish for 
holiday times and show occasions. 
As to dough-gods, or goods, they are 
dumplings made in the image of a 
man or an animal, and dropped into 
boiling soup, as noodles are dropped, 



holding an extra amount of some 
raising preparation to insure their being 
very light; a kind of glorified 'duff,' 
for the lumbermen will not tolerate 
anything heavy or underdone. It took 
me some time to acquire just the 
knack; but I caught it finally, and now 
I never fail." 

"But do you mean you still continue 
this occupation — or rather diversion?" 
the Englishman said with a little gasp 
of astonishment. "As guest in the 
camp, I suppose, an investigator, there 
from a laudable curiosity, but of course 
no question of permanency, or — neces- 
sity." 

"Certainly, the very greatest. Any 
failure on my part would have lessened 
the output of logs, and that was not 
to be thought of." 

"But why should you care as to the 
output, or was it a question of profit- 
sharing? I am profoundly interested 
in your American methods as well as 
dishes, and you puzzle me. Do all of 
you fill sudden gaps, wherever you may 
happen to find them, with the same 
sort of energy that seems to have 
filled you?" 

"Under the same circumstances, un- 
doubtedly. I happened to be the owner 
of the camp." And, as he turned to 
answer a word from some one near 
him, the astonished Englishman re- 
corded in his note-book, "All Ameri- 
can lumber-camp owners become camp 
cooks whenever necessary."

Strange and Familiar Things to be Found 
in the Markets of Jamaica, B. W. I. 



By Mrs, F. Violet Sanborn 



THERE are several markets in 
Kingston, Jamaica, where the 
native vegetables and fruits are 
to be had in abundance. A visit to one 
of these on Saturday morning would re- 
joice the heart of the American house- 
wife, and send her home with a well- 
filled basket for a much smaller outlay 
than would be possible in the. States. 

Scales are used only at the meat 
stands, as vegetables are sold in little 
heaps. The bunch of soup greens is 
in evidence, to which a small piece of 
pumpkin is added, to give body to the 
soup, as thick soups are the only ones 
served in the homes of the natives. 
The variety of vegetables is quite equal 
to those to be found in America, our 
own cabbage, carrot, white turnip, beets, 
onions, sweet and Irish potatoes, to- 
mato, cucumbers, okra, squash, garden 
egg, peas, corn, lima and string beans 
being the most familiar ones. The un- 
familiar ones are the yam, yampee, 
cocoa, the latter being the root of a lily. 
The flesh of the cocoa is very like that 
of our sweet potato, and is usually 
roasted or boiled, and served with 
melted butter, salt, and pepper. The 
skin is dark brown in color, turning to 
a rose-pink near the edible portion. 
It is very highly prized for thickening 
the native soups. 

The spinach of the island is very un- 
like our own save in color. It is pre- 
pared, however, in the same manner. 
The yampee is much better flavored 
than the yam, but neither equals the 
flavor of our Southern yam. The cho- 
cho is the finest of the native vegetables, 
first cousin to the cucumber and sister- 
in-law to the summer squash. It is a 
peculiarly shaped vegetable, with a pale 



green skin. It is prepared by peeling, 
cutting in halves lengthwise, and boil- 
ing in salt and water until tender, being 
served with melted butter only. A 
most delicious mock apple sauce is 
made from this vegetable, which would 
deceive many, as it resembles very 
closely the apple in flavor. The quaint, 
little, bonnet pepper is very much prized 
for seasoning, and it certainly gives zest 
to all dishes in which it is used. It is 
shaped like an odd little bonnet, and is 
very fairy in construction. The ' 'ackee' ' 
is another stranger in our country, but 
it is certainly delicious when prepared 
by the native cooks. It grows on large 
trees, and is, in formation, very like our 
bell pepper, and is, in fact, of the same 
color before it is ripe ; but, when ready 
for cooking, it turns a brilliant scarlet, 
bursts into four quarters, and discloses 
four black seeds, attached to which is a 
flesh-colored mass resembling in shape a 
tiny sweetbread. This is freed from 
seeds and cooked in boiling water until 
tender, when it turns the color of the 
yolk of an egg. It is used in several 
ways, but is considered most delicious 
as a garnish for salt fish, which is one of 
the favorite breakfast dishes served here. 
The American pie is seldom served 
here; for nature has provided delicious 
desserts on every hand, in the form of 
strange but luscious fruits that grow in 
such profusion, and need only to be iced 
before serving. Of Course, the banana is 
crowned king of fruits in Jamaica; but 
he certainly has many queens as con- 
sorts, and the favorite is undoubtedly 
the * 'neaseberry," the skin of which is a 
dark brown, and, when cut open, it dis- 
closes three good-sized, flat, black seeds, 
which are, of course, removed before 



The Walls of a House

eating. The flesh resembles our gem 
melon, and is eaten by scooping from 
the skin with a spoon. The pulp is 
sweet, with an indescribable flavor that 
is very pleasing. 

The "star apple," which looks like 
the rainbow, is said, by those who have 
made the journey and returned, to taste 
like a touch of the life beyond. One 
does not dream of the nectar contained 
within, while gazing on the dark purple 
mixed with the deepest green of the 
skin. This fruit is as round as an 
orange. 

The "custard apple" is nature's way 
of serving a daintily flavored boiled cus- 
tard in a globe of reddish-yellow. 

To know the banana in its perfection, 
select a fat ripe one, cut in halves 
lengthwise, and eat from the skin with 
a fork. The orange is eaten impaled 
on a fork after having been peeled. 
The Jamaica orange is a sphere filled 
with wine, not to be found off this treas- 
ure-filled casket. Guava, stewed and 
served with the delicious cocoanut 
cream, as prepared here, will prove a 
memory that will not fade. 



The "soursop" would prove a treas- 
ure in the hands of the American cook. 
One dreams of the cooling ices, sherbets, 
and beverages, which this odd prickly 
fruit would yield, and longs for the era 
of the perfect air-ship, well furnished 
with cold-storage appliances. Fruits 
in Jamaica are served first, last, and all 
the time. 

The "breadfruit," which was nearly 
swept out of existence on the island 
during the fearful hurricane last August, 
is beginning to appear again in the 
markets. Imagine an immense horse- 
chestnut, which it resembles closely, 
light green in color, growing singly on a 
tree bearing a large, forked leaf, and you 
can form some idea of this strange fruit. 
It is boiled or roasted, and is the daily 
bread of the native, as the wheat bread 
of America was unknown here until the 
introduction of "steam-bread," as it 
is called. The bread for the whole 
island is made by a steam bakery, and 
is sold by the natives from trays carried 
on their heads. Bread is never made in 
the homes, and our own quick breads 
are almost unknown. 



The Walls of a House 

By Marjorie March 



WHEN a house is finished, 
laid with carpets, and made 
habitable with a careful se- 
lection of furniture, but half of its ar- 
tistic possibilities are told, if the walls 
yet remain bare. 

For there are four 'walls to every 
room and numberless doorways to be 
made uniformly attractive, and this is 
no easy task. 

First, let us consider the hanging of 
pictures, their selection and manner of 



framing. Masterpieces of art are be- 
yond the reach of most of us; yet, in 
these days of progress, pictures of no 
mean worth, engravings, carvings, and 
plaster casts may be bought at reason- 
able prices. Outside of houses where 
really bad taste flaunts itself, the worst 
criticism to be made is the framing of 
pictures and their hanging in places 
unsuitable for the best effect. Heavy, 
gaudy framing to simple pictures is to 
be condemned. Fortunately, the ten- 



*3» 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



dency to have pictures framed without 
mats, in chaste wooden frames, is be- 
coming more and more noticeable ; and 
even larger pictures, where gold work is 
used or massive frames required, cling to 
the dignified type of simplicity of out- 
line, in happy contrast to the "ginger- 
bread" frames seen in most houses a 
quarter of a century ago. 

Pictures should be selected with some 
idea as to their character, that the walls 
of every house may bear marks of in- 
dividuality. Then, too, they should be 
carefully hung where the best lighting 
may be obtained. A dark corner of a 
room is often made brighter by having 
hung on the wall a picture with bright 
coloring. In the same way walls, on 
which there is a generous flow of light, 
should hold pictures where detail rather 
than general effect may be noticed. 
Engravings and dark pictures are par- 
ticularly suitable on a light wall. 

Certain rooms of a house, such as 
dens, bedrooms, halls, and living-rooms, 
are not spoiled by the happy grouping of 
a number of pictures, while other rooms 
require a more dignified selection, 
where each picture is given a place of 
honor. For instance, if in a drawing- 
room stately family portraits look down 
from the walls, nothing could be more 
incongruous than to hang amid them 
little pictures that have in themselves 
no intrinsic value. These large pictures 
should be carefully placed. Generally, 
a large picture needs distance to give it 
its best effect. 

In a room that depends for its wall 
decoration upon the number of pictures 
avoid uniformity in hanging. Nothing 
can be more stiff and hopeless than a 
wall hung with even rows of pictures. 
In the same way, if three pictures are to 
be hung one above another, select one 
small one to hang between the other two, 
taking care that frames with light and 
dark mats do not come in juxtapo- 
sition. 

In old-fashioned mansions a hall was 



a passageway rather than a place to be 
made attractive, as if one might linger 
a moment on the stairway. Many 
houses, to-day, cling to this idea; and 
their halls, even when possessing possi- 
bilities, are bare and barren of orna- 
ment. 

On the other hand, the modern house 
has developed the hall, until it has be- 
come a living-room of generous dimen- 
sions, furnished and hung with pictures 
as is any other room in the house. 
Even when the hall is olden in regard to 
size, do not make the mistake of having 
it give a cold welcome to those who pass 
its portals. There is room for a table 
and a chair in most halls; and on the 
stairway pictures may be hung, to give 
it a look of furnishing. Here is an ef- 
fective placing for a picture with a bit 
of vivid red in its coloring, for a stair- 
way is apt to be a dark place. Light 
from below is generally adequate for 
the pictures upon a stairway in the day- 
time. At night a hanging lantern from 
above renders an effective lighting. 

The decoration of dining-room walls 
has fortunately undergone a radical 
change in the past few years. No 
longer is the diner compelled to sit be- 
neath still-life pictures of fruit and game 
design, for sporting, prints and driving 
scenes of vivid coloring, framed in simple 
wooden frames, have come to take their 
place. China closets, plate shelves, 
shelf mouldings, and effective groupings 
of beautiful plates upon the walls have 
also rendered the dining-room one of the 
easiest rooms to manage, as far as its 
wall decorations are concerned. An old- 
time mirror will also do admirable duty 
upon the walls of either hall or dining- 
room, or in the living-room. The orna- 
mental as well as useful qualities of a 
mirror were well known to our grand- 
mothers, for in almost any room the 
well-placed mirror will tell a "pretty 
story" twice, and often make a room 
appear larger than it really is. The 
wise decorator will give a mirror a well- 



The Walls of a House 



139 



arranged bit of the room as food for its 
reflection. 

Plaster designs are extremely deco- 
rative, well placed. An ' 'over-mantel " 
in bas-relief, for instance, will give an 
aesthetic touch to a room; and a digni- 
fied bust of Hermes or Venus, or the 
"poem in form," — the flying Mercury, 
— upon the top of a bookcase, will be 
the epitome of good taste. 

Put pictures of famous writers in the 
library, musical prints and pictures of 
composers in the music-room. Here, 
again, is given a wide range for indi- 
viduality. One lover of Shakespeare, 
whom I knew, rendered his den most 
attractive in this way. Here was a 
bookcase, which held most of Shake- 
speare's works. A bust of the great 
poet stood upon the top of this. Over 
his desk, which was of carved mahogany, 
were hung a few pictures of the best 
known Shakesperian characters, artis- 
tically framed. A low wainscoting ran 
around the room; and just above this 
were hung the sonnets, framed sepa- 
rately in dark red passepartouting. 
These were especially printed, the first 
letter of each being illuminated. The 
effect of the whole was an harmonious 
idea carried out in dignified detail. 

In the average house another wall 
space taxes the ingenuity of the deco- 
rator is that over a doorway. Here 
a plate shelf will often solve the diffi- 
culty. This can hold a few large plates 
of decorative design, copper or pewter 
trays brightly polished, or one or two 
vases of unique shape. If there is 
space between the door and the ceiling 
for this ' 'over-door" ornamentation, it 
will make the room seem higher, and 
give the necessary touch that renders 
the bare doorway a less unattractive 
place. In houses of colonial design the 
carvings over doorways were given due 
consideration, with the result that the 
simplicity and dignity of their chaste 
lines of architecture were noticeable not 
only outside, but inside of the house. 



To those who have the pleasure before 
them of building their own home, may 
I suggest that a little study of this 
matter may result in making their 
houses vastly more attractive? 

Doors, badly placed, often break up a 
wall, so that its possibilities for decora- 
tion are rendered almost useless. Care 
should be taken in this regard. It is, 
also, of utmost importance that doors 
open out of a room rather than into it. 
Ornamental screens and the effective 
hanging of portieres often make an ob- 
trusive door more satisfactory. If the 
door be entirely useless, it can be shut 
•up completely. There are various ways 
of hiding such a door. It may be cov- 
ered with matting or burlap, and some 
pictures or a mirror hung upon it, to 
make a contrasting bit of ornamenta- 
tion. Or the space may be filled with 
narrow book-shelves half-way down to 
the floor. The lower part may be fitted 
with a hinged shelf, which makes an 
admirable desk. This arrangement is 
particularly good in a small room, 
where there is not much room for furni- 
ture. Or the shelves may hold orna- 
ments, a carved chest to hold maga- 
zines being placed against the lower 
part of the door. In a sleeping apart- 
ment the unused doorway may be con- 
verted into a wardrobe, a curtain of 
some light material covering its prac- 
tical utility from observation. Care 
should be taken in the selection of 
screens, portieres, and other draperies, 
that their colorings do not contrast too 
sharply with the wall paper. 

In the choice of wall papers, but one 
glance at the interior of many a house 
will proclaim this part of house decora- 
tion a study in itself, too exhaustive to 
do more than touch upon in this short 
article. The greatest care should be 
taken to acquire the best results. 
Light papers should be placed upon the 
walls of rooms badly lighted; and, of 
course, the reverse holds good. Digni- 
fied tonings should be chosen for re- 



140

ception-rooms and halls of a house, and 
care should prevent the inharmonious 
colorings often to be observed in passing 
from one room to another. I have seen, 
in going up a stairway, in a house, two 
wide-open doors. On the walls of one 
room was a blue paper, on which a red 
rose pattern trailed its way. On the 
other room a green paper had been used, 
and, of course, the effect of the two from 
the stairway could have been prevented, 
if a little forethought had been used. 

Borders are no longer put upon the 
best wall papers; but often, where a 



wainscoting effect is wished, the upper- 
two thirds of a wall may be papered with 
one paper and the lower third with 
a darker kind, either a darker tint of 
the same coloring or a contrasting color 
that harmonizes with the upper portion. 
A shelf moulding or a simple wainscot- 
ing rail joins the two together. 

The walls of a house call for the 
greatest interpretation of individuality; 
and it is a pleasure to see Inclination 
asserting itself, in odd and unexpected 
arrangement, when it chooses Good 
Taste for its helpmeet. 



Milk Twelve Hours from the Cow to the 

Baby • 

By Mrs. H. M. Plunkett 



BY a slip of the pen I was made 
to say, in the September number 
of this magazine, exactly the op- 
posite of what was intended in the sen- 
tence: "The death-rate of infants and 
young children — those over five years 
of age — is tHe tine test of the sanitary 
conditions and of the sanitary admin- 
istration of a community." It is the 
death-rate of children under five years 
of age that is the true index of the sani- 
tary condition and administration of 
any given community. 

The editor of American Medicine says, 
"The death-rate of children under five 
is a fairly accurate register of the success 
or failure of a nation or race in the 
struggle for existence." 

Dr. Arthur R, Reynolds— Health 
Commissioner of Chicago, and cele- 
brated as one of the most energetic, effi- 
cient, and successful health officers in 
the country — has accomplished some 
truly wonderful results in the reduction 
of the death-rate of children under five, 



as the following figures will show. In 
1894 the proportion of under-five deaths 
was 46. 1 ; and a table of all the years in 
the following decade shows a steady de- 
cline, including those killed in the Iro- 
quois Theatre fire, till in 1904 the propor- 
tion was 24.01 per cent., nearly one-half 
only of those recorded at the beginning 
of the decade. Contrary to what a 
person without reflection would fancy, 
Chicago is now the healthiest large city 
in the world, as these figures show. 

Death-rates per 1,000 of all ages: 
London, 15.62; New York, 18.18; Chi- 
cago, 15.34. 

Death-rates under five, per 10,000 of 
population: London, 55.7; New York, 
59.0; Chicago, 44.1. 

This remarkable condition of things 
has attracted the attention of sanita- 
rians all over the world, and many can- 
not believe that it is the result of in- 
telligent effort, and say it is just the result 
of the wonderful climate of Chicago; 
but a comparison of the most healthful 



Milk Twelve Hours from the Cow to the Baby 



141 



years with those least so shows no re- 
markable meteorological difference in 
the "climate," or weather, in these 
years. Notice that Chicago's under- 
five death-rate is 20.8 per cent, less 
than London's, and 25 per cent, less 
than New York's. 

How has this surprising result been 
accomplished ? First, by a steady sys- 
tem of instruction, through the work of 
the summer corps of doctors in the tene- 
ment houses, who distribute leaflets in 
all the various languages spoken, ex- 
plaining how to care for the milk that 
is the principal food for those under 
five, after it comes into the hands of 
the mothers. The enlightenment of 
the mothers is further helped by the 
visiting nurses and all tjie charity 
workers, and the effect of bacteria, in 
neutralizing its food- value, is fully ex- 
plained. Every one knows that sour 
milk is unfit for food, but every one 
does not know that milk may be unfit 
for food many hours before it be- 
comes sour to the taste. Before the 
milk is .drawn from the udder, it is ab- 
solutely free from bacteria. Before it 
has reached the pail,— -even under the 
most cleanly conditions, — at least 150 
to the teaspoonful have been caught up 
from the air. Unless checked by cold, 
these will have multiplied in twenty- 
four hours to 400,000, and soon the milk 
becomes sour to the taste. Such milk 
fed to babes sets up a still more rapid 
fermentation in the warm stomach and 
intestines, and is the direct cause of the 
cholera infantum that each summer 
sweeps its thousands into untimely 
graves. 

Now what can be done to counteract 
this cruel loss of infant life? The 
wealthy get milk that has been drawn 
from the cow under the most cleanly 
conditions, cooled at once, and sealed 
in thoroughly sterilized bottles, and is 
of course free from these destructive or- 
ganisms; but the poor need not despair. 
There is a very simple but effective 



method of pasteurizing even the milk 
that has been long on its way, and al- 
ready is rapidly developing tie deadly 
bacteria. At once on its delivery it 
should be put into a thoroughly scalded 
bottle, stoppered with a wad of clean 
cotton-wool, or covered with two or 
three thicknesses of clean cheese-cloth. 
Put the bottle in a kettle containing 
two quarts of cold water, bring the 
water to the boiling-point, and remove 
from the fire at once. (Do not allow it 
to boil after the first few bubbles.) Set 
the kettle aside, to let the milk become 
heated evenly (this kills the bacteria); 
and, when cold, put it in the ice-box, 
or, if there is none, in the coolest place 
possible. 

I said the smaller death-rate of chil- 
dren under five was due to intelligent 
effort. In addition to all this instruc- 
tion of mothers and nurses, a most 
vigilant watch has been established over 
the milk-dealers. They have been con- 
pelled to paint the cans, from which 
they sell skimmed milk, a bright red: 
that which analysis shows to be watered 
or adulterated with preservatives is 
mercilessly poured into the gutter; and 
now after years of effort there is a corps 
of inspectors who go to the dairies, and 
see how these are conducted. During 
the week ending July 30 last 128 herds, 
embracing 2,758 cows, were inspected. 
106 dairies were found in good condition, 
21 in fair, but 34 were found where the 
cows were fed with wet malt; and, as 
a result of these inspections, 45 milk- 
dealers have been notified to stop the 
receipt and sale of milk from those 
dairies, as the municipal code makes it 
a misdemeanor to sell or offer for sale 
such milk, and the health officers are 
authorized to confiscate and destroy all 
such milk, when found within the city 
limits. 

Of course every hour after the milk 
.leaves the cow allows myriads more of 
bacteria to accumulate within it, and 
now Dr. Reynolds is making a vigorous 



H* 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



push to have the milk intended for chil- 
dren's food delivered twice in the twenty- 
four hours, or, as he says, ' ' twelve hours 
from the cow to the baby " ; and he well 
argues that with all the present facilities 
for transportation by trolley and by 
steam it can be accomplished, and all 
the land will rejoice with him, if he ac- 
complishes his purpose. 

It is now sixty-six years since Chicago 
was incorporated with a population of 
4,170 souls. No statistics of mortality 
were kept till 1847, when the death-rate 
was 34 in the 1,000. With the increase 
of population and the introduction of 
pestilential diseases it rose in 1849 to 
73.80, swelled by Asiatic cholera, to 
which the city was repeatedly a prey 
before the introduction of lake water in 
1 85 1. In 1855 began the elevation of 
the city bodily, eight feet, so as to obtain 
drainage and sewerage; and now it is 
beginning to feel the great benefit from 
its drainage canal, and the daily analysis 
of its water shows that it is "safe" — 
many days, and that heavy rains do not 
injure its quality greatly. 

These facts are cited, to encourage 



people everywhere to make intelligent 
effort to procure pure water supply, 
efficient drainage and wholesome food, 
especially for the young. That these 
things "pay," read the following quo- 
tation from an address given before 
the University of Chicago last year by 
Dr. Reynolds : ' ' During the quarter of 
a century, preceding water supply and 
sewerage, the average annual death-rate 
was 33.87 per 1,000 of the population. 
In the succeeding twenty-five years this 
rate had fallen to 22.37 per 1,000, and in 
the subsequent period ending in 1902 it 
still further fell to 18.16, or a little more 
than half the rate of the first twenty- 
five years of the city's existence. The 
local improvement clubs, the social 
settlements, the women's organizations, 
have given the city clean alleys and back 
yards, the visiting nurses and their kin- 
dred have taught the mothers, and the 
health officers have fought a good and 
winning fight during ten years for a 
pure milk supply. These explain the 
diminishing death-rate. Chicago takes 
care of its children, so that the wonder- 
ful saving of life is an open secret." 



Recalled 

By Eugene C. Dolson 



I see beyond the smoky town, 
In dreams, this autumn morn, 

A stubble field, high-ridged and brown, 
Set thick with shocks of corn. 

And past a stretch of pasture land, 
Where sheep and cattle graze, 

In red and gold the lone woods stand, 
'Neath skies of sombre haze. 

I wandered there in years long gone, 
On warm fall days like these, 

To list the interminable moan 
Among the, forest trees. 



In that deep gorge which lies between 

The cliffs abrupt and gray. 
Through seas of swamp-grass rank and green, 

The river cut its way. 

Whatever charms each place may miss, 

That loss I do not know: 
They come to me on days like this, 

As in the long ago. 

Across the changing years that gleam 

Through mists of memory, 
By plain and woodland, rock and stream, 

My lost youth walks with me. 



Ortolans en Cercueil 

Translated from "Recettes Curicuscs " in "L'Artdu bien Manger," by Ed. Rechardin 



BELIEVE me, you could soon 
count up the houses where Bril- 
lat-Savarin, were he alive, would 
consent to dine a second time ! 

Menus from a cook-shop and im- 
ported wines from the corner grocer! 
But most people haven't the time to 
linger at the table, as in the times of 
our grandfathers. A young wife, in 
those days, would pride herself on 
knowing how to prepare with her own 
dainty, fingers some delectable dish or 
savory. She was acquainted with the 
best recipes, and made it her business 
to study the tastes and whims of her 
guests. Nowadays our young hostesses 
are mostly engaged upon outside show, 
and have thoughts mainly centred in 
their couturihe. The princess in the 
fairy tale would no longer be apt to 
lose her ring in making a cake of 
wheaten flour! 

It seems also that the professional 
parasite would not enjoy the good 
times he used to, either. No, but the 
specialists for stomach troubles become 
millionaires in ten years ! 

Do you remember that admirable 
chef of the Comte S., whom he had so 
skilfully enticed from the Prince W. ? 
I can see him now in my mind's eye: 
a perfect gentleman, attired in the 
most correct style. He had no more 
the appearance of issuing from a 
kitchen than you or I. He would 
arrive every morning about half-past 
nine o'clock, and step up to his mas- 



ter's room; and then they would have 
long conferences and grave councils 
before deciding on some perfect pro- 
gramme for the edification of the guests, 
each one of whom the count would de- 
scribe, in order that their little weak- 
nesses might be taken into considera- 
tion. At the end of the interview the 
chef would return to the kitchens 
below, give a few orders to his three 
cordon bleus, — one in charge of the 
roasts, the second of the ragouts and 
stews and sauces, and the third of the 
vegetables and sweet pastries, — after 
which no one saw him again until one 
hour before serving time, — the little 
hour during which he would taste each 
dish and give some finishing touch, 
when, as he expressed it, he came to 
"sign." 

What was his salary, do you suppose ? 

Oh, about sixty thousand, — a mere 
nothing. It is through him I obtained 
the recipe for ortolans en cercueil. 

You take, first, an ortolan (a small 
bird like fieldfare), which is a perfect 
ball of fat, and which you will have 
smothered with a few drops of old 
"armagnac"; second, a truffle from 
P6rigord of a generous size. You bone 
the bird, and dig him a narrow grave 
in the truffle, and wrap the whole in 
buttered paper, and cook slowly in 
the oven, and serve him up with cham- 
pagne. 

There! and may the Lord preserve 
us from dyspepsia and gout!

A MODERN SCHOOL 

PROFESSOR HANUS,of Harvard 
University, has written a book 
on "A Modern School." In this 
book he says: — 

1 ' Education is a preparation for com- 
plete living by participation in life's 
opportunities, duties, and privileges, so 
far as they can be rendered intelligible, 
interesting, and accessible to childhood 
and youth. Complete living includes 
usefulness and happiness. Usefulness 
is the activity that promotes the inter- 
ests of mankind. Happiness means the 
enjoyment of work and leisure. School 
education should therefore equip a boy 
for a vocation — social service — and also 



equip him for an enjoyment of the re- 
fined pleasures of life." 

"Our contemporary programmes are 
congested because they comprise too 
large a remnant of the old rubbish that 
used to be needed to take up all the 
time and attention of the pupil for 
eight pre-high-school years. It took 
a lot of useless arithmetical puzzles 
and technicalities, of meaningless pars- 
ing and paraphrasing, of useless geo- 
graphical statistics, of spelling up and 
spelling down, of deadening re-reading 
of a single reader in each grade for 
several years, — it took a lot of such 
time-consuming and profitless drill to 
fill up eight years of school life, and to 
deaden hosts of children's interests in 
intellectual pursuits forever! But the 
time was so consumed, and the feat 
was accomplished." 

"Democratic education that offers 
equal opportunities to all must, in my 
opinion, provide as adequately for the 
vocational aims of future artisans, mer- 
chants, and farmers as for future pro- 
fessional men." 

The truth is dawning on the age 
that usefulness and happiness are in- 
timately associated. Indeed, they are 
almost identical, one and the same, 
and constitute the main object and 
end of living. To energize is to be 
happy. Complete living means the 
freest activity along lines of ever- 
widening usefulness. Hence it follows 
preparation for usefulness is the cri- 
terion by which all instruction and 
training are to be judged. In other 
words, and in accordance with the con- 
clusions of Professor Hanus and other 
noted educators, education in the future 
must provide for the "vocational 
aims" of farmers and housekeepers, as 
well as for professional men. 

Domestic science concerns the welfare 
of the race. No field of usefulness is 
wider, and none has been less profitably 
cultivated in the past. In modern 
phraseology, then, the vocational aims

of the future wives and housekeepers 
must be no less adequately provided 
for in our educational systems than 
are those in other vocations. 

We commend "A Modern School" 
as a most timely discussion of the most 
vital of subjects. 

THE BERLIN CONGRESS 

THE American delegates to the 
women's congress in Berlin 
appear to have learned quite 
as much as they taught. Mrs. Johnson 
declares that the Berlin meeting "can 
never be surpassed" in its executive 
management. "Such command of 
money, such great halls, such superb 
decorations, such great audiences, such 
recognition from empress and govern- 
ment officials, and social leaders, was 
something unexpected and astounding." 
Mrs. Sewall concludes a glowing state- 
ment of experiences with these earnest 
and somewhat caustic reflections: — 

"Personally, I have •always felt that 
the chief weakness of my country is 
its false patriotism, the vanity which 
assumes that it is first and best, which 
naturally results in indolence and self- 
indulgence. If American women are 
to keep pace with the women of other 
countries, they must be more teach- 
able, less arrogant, less luxurious and 
self-indulgent, more serious in their 
aims, more painstaking, accurate, and 
laborious in their methods. That is 
my view, and I hope that I shall still 
have some friends after expressing it." 
Knowledge that is born of experi- 
ence is not only convincing, but whole- 
some. It expands vision and destroys 
narrow self-esteem. We need to real- 
ize the fact that there are other lands 
and other races on the earth than our 
own, that truth and goodness and 
progress are not confined to a single 
people or a single sect. All the na- 
tions of the globe, in their several ways, 
have been ever groping, are still grop- 



ing, towards the. light, and each may 
learn something helpful from the ex- 
perience of others. To the traveler 
and others who have made themselves 
conversant, it is evident that some 
things are made and done better abroad 
than in this "our own beloved land." 
For instance, foreign china, pottery, 
and glassware surpass in quality, color, 
and style anything that can be pro- 
duced here. Art, in general, in the 
Old World, has been carried to a higher 
degree of excellence than it has reached 
in the new, while in frugality, economy, 
and gentility we can learn many a 
lesson from our neighbors across the 
sea. 

Modesty, we fear, is not a leading 
trait of the Great Republic. Every- 
where, it is true, the spirit of boastful- 
ness and swagger is quite too apparent. 
And yet to us, at least, it seems that 
patriotism and militarism are by no 
means one and the same. True prog- 
ress in these days lies along the ways 
of peace. Above all, a teachable spirit 
is to be sought for and cultivated. 
There is always hope of better things 
as long as one is willing to learn. Dis- 
content with present attainments leads 
to higher standards of truth. 



RECREATION AND HEALTH. 

SOME one has said recently that 
no housekeeper should confine 
herself to home duties for a 
period longer than three days without 
resorting to some kind of relaxation or 
diversion outside her own home. This 
remark has meaning. Put it into prac- 
tice, and the result would be less fric- 
tion in the management of the house- 
hold, stronger nerves and higher spirits 
on the part of mistress or housekeeper. 
The vacation habit, or life in the 
open air, is growing apace, and the cus- 
tom is commendable from every view- 
point. For physical exercise — espe- 
cially exercise out of doors — means 



146 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



health, vigor, and cheerfulness. " 'Tis 
the natural way of living." It is com- 
ing to be generally known that the 
frequent practice of some form of out- 
door exercise, deep breathing, and cold 
bathing are the sources whence come 
both physical strength and mental 
equilibrium. In other words, proper 
exercise, pure air, and wholesome food 
are nature's restoratives. These are 
efficacious remedial agents where naught 
else avails. Perfect health cannot 
be attained or maintained through 
indulgence of the appetites or a sub- 
mission of matters of vital interest to 
the issues of caprice and chance. The 
conditions of healthful living must 
be studied, observed, and practised. 
Thought is to be given to the matter, 
habits are to be formed, and daily at- 
tention given to the observance of a 
strict regimen and systematic training, 
in accordance with nature's laws. 

And now that the regular vacation 
season is past, and the return is made 
to the routine of indoor pursuits, take 
care lest the transition be too sudden; 
take care lest we forget the importance 
of outdoor exercise, the cold bath, the 
deep breathing, and hence suffer rapid 
loss in vitality, strength, and power of 
endurance, which are so indispensable 
to successful achievement in every 
phase of active life. 

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SILENCE 

UT of silence comes thy 
strength," wrote Carlyle. The 
chief value of frequent con- 
tact with nature and life in the coun- 
try is its soothing influence over tired 
nerves. It conduces, also, to quiet 
thought and meditation, the source of 
inspiration and power. A writer in the 
London Christian World, in a very read- 
able article "On being Quiet," says:— 




"We are all for 'the strenuous life/ 
We throng together in towns, noisy 
Babylons, where the effort of each is 
to make himself heard above the roar- 
ing of his fellows. We have not even 
time for digestion. At his breakfast 
our citizen must be doing at least 
three or four things besides eating. 
He is fingering his letters, glancing 
over the Times money article, discuss- 
ing the latest news. We are not sup- 
posed to have lived unless we have gone 
everywhere, seen everything, are on 
terms with all the notabilities, and 
have done something ourselves which 
the public talks about. 

11 With the general mind, quietness is 
synonymous with dulness. And there 
is undoubtedly a quietness of this 
quality about which we have nothing 
here to say. There is a muteness of 
mental vacancy, it does not appeal 
to us. Yet it remains — and all the 
finer spirits know it— that there is no 
way of taking life's fullest measure, of 
tasting its innermost essence, except 
by the cult of quietness. . . . 

"Let us be sure that for every 
mother's son and daughter of us the 
quiet mind is the secret of living. We 
dig all our treasure out of this mine. 
All the revelations are the gift of still- 
ness. The lake must be calm, if the 
heavens are to be reflected on its sur- 
face. Domestic happiness would in- 
crease 50 per cent, to-morrow, if half 
that will be said then were left unsaid, 
and if what is uttered were in a lower 
key. We shall learn something of God 
when we know how to be quiet. We 
shall know then what a heathen, Epic- 
tetus, had found out: 'When you have 
shut your door and darkened your 
room, say not to yourself you are 
alone. God is in that chamber of 
yours!'"

Cream-of-Chicken Soup 
Use the broth in which two fowl 
have been cooked. Let two quarts of 
chicken broth simmer with two stalks 
of celery, half a small carrot, half an 
onion, and a tablespoon ful of sweet 
herbs and spices tied in a bit of muslin, 
about one hour. Pound one cup of 
cooked chicken with two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, in a mortar, then rub the 
mixture through a puree sieve, and add 
it to the broth, strained from the vege- 
tables. Cook one-fourth a cup of rice 
flour in one-fourth a cup of butter. 
Dilute with some of the chicken stock, 
heat to the boiling-point, then stir into 
the rest of the soup. Let all boil once, 
then add the beaten yolks of two 



or three eggs, diluted with a cup or 
more of cream. Let the soup become

ring constantly meanwhile. Add such 
seasoning as needed, and serve at 
once. 

Cream -of- Li ma Bean Soup 
Boil one pint of lima beans, half an 
onion, a stalk of celery, and a bit of 
parsley in salted water until tender. 
Pound in a mortar, then rub through 
a puree sieve. Add one quart of 
white soup stock (made from veal, 
lamb, or chicken) or half milk and the 
other half of stock or water. Cook 
one-fourth a cup of flour in one-fourth 
a cup of butter, and dilute with the

puree and liquid. Let boil, then add 
one cup of hot cream, and salt and 
pepper as needed. If desired, enrich 
the soup with beaten yolks of egg. 



Truffled Fish 

Truffled Fish 
Butter a fish mould very thoroughly. 
Cut truffles into very thin slices. 
Stamp out the slices into small pieces, 
or cut them into narrow strips as will 
fit the depressions in the mould. Set 
the mould on ice while 
the fish preparation is 
prepared. Any firm 
fish may be used for 
the forcemeat. Hali- 
but was used for the 
dish shown in the 
illustration. Remove 
the bones and skin 
from the fish, and put 
these over the fire 
with cold water to 
cover. Add two or 
three slices, each, of 
onion and carrot, and 
let simmer, to make j 
fish stock for the sauce 
to be served with ' 
the fish. Scrape the 
pulp of the fish 
from the fibres, and pound it in a 
mortar. To one cup, or half a pound, 
of pulp, beat in half a cup of panada 
(the crumb of bread cooked to a pulp 
in milk), the unbeaten whites of three 



eggs, half a teaspoonful of salt (or 
more), and one-third a cup of butter. 
Pound until very smooth, then press 
through a puree sieve. (The quantity 
given in the recipe 
may be quickly 
pressed, with a pestle, 
through a gravy 
strainer set into one 
part of a double 
boiler.) Then gradu- 
ally beat in one cup 
of cream, whipped 
to a solid froth. 
When the cream 
is mixed evenly 
through the other 
ingredients, put the 
mixture into the 
decorated mould, fill it solidly, and 
make the top smooth. Set the 
mould, on several folds of paper, 
in a baking-dish, pour in boiling water 
to half fill the pan, and let cook- in 
the oven until the centre feels firm. 



Fish Mould Decorated with Truffle; 

It will take about twenty-five minutes.

While the fish is baking, make ready 
hot mashed potato, well seasoned with 
salt, pepper, butter, 
and cream. Beat 
until very light, 
then shape into 
rosettes. Put a 
cooked potato ball 
on the top of each 
rosette, brush over 
the balls and the 
edges of the mashed 
potato with beaten 
yolk of egg, and set 
the potato into the 
oven, to brown deli- 
cately. Serve, on the

Ham Croquettes 
Cook a slice of onion five or more 
minutes in one-fourth a cup of butter 
without browning the butter. Take 
out the onion, add one-fourth a cup of 
flour, a scant half-teaspoonful of salt, 
and a generous sprinkling of paprika. 
Cook until frothy, then add gradually 
one cup and a half of rich milk. After 
boiling five or six minutes, stir in one 
cup of boiled rice, one cup of cooked 
ham, chopped, and a beaten egg. Let 
become very hot, then turn into a dish 
and set aside to become cold. Shape 
in balls or cylinders, roll in sifted 
bread crumbs, cover with beaten egg 
and again roll in crumbs, and fry in 
deep fat. Serve with tomato or paprika 



Beefsteak Chowder 
Cut a generous pound of round steak 
into strips an inch and a half long and 
half an inch thick and wide. Cut a 
two-inch cube of fat salt pork into tiny 
bits, and cook in a hot frying-pan with 
an onion sliced very thin. When the 
fat is tried out of the pork and the 
onion is browned, add a quart of 
boiling water. Let simmer five min- 
utes, then pour the whole over the 
pieces of steak. Bring the contents of 
the saucepan quickly to the boiling- 
point, let boil five minutes, then sim- 
mer until the meat is tender. Have 
ready four or five potatoes, pared, cut 
in slices, scalded in boiling water, 
drained, and rinsed in cold water. 
Add the potatoes with salt and pepper 
to the meat. Add also, if needed.

crackers, and dispose them in a soup 
tureen. Pour over them the chowder, 
and serve at once. 

Egg Plant au Gratin 
Peel an egg plant, and cut it into 
half-inch slices. Sprinkle the slices 
lightly with salt, and set them aside 
for a time (to draw out the moisture), 
then press them lightly, and dry on a 
cloth. Dredge or roll the slices in 
flour, then fry — first on one side and 
then on the other — in a little hot butter. 
Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Add three tablespoonfuls of flour, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of 
pepper. Let cook until frothy, then 
add a cup of white stock and half a 
cup of we 11 -reduced tomato puree. 
Stir until the boiling-point is reached, 
then add about one-third a cup of 
cream. Spread a layer of sauce upon 
a buttered gratin dish, sprinkle the 
sauce with grated Parmesan cheese,

melt the cheese. 

Eggs Benedict 
Split and toast the required number 
of English muffins. Have ready a 
poached egg and some thin rounds 
of broiled ham, one of each for each 
half muffin, and for three eggs, a little 
Hollandaise sauce. Make the sauce by 
beating one-fourth a 
cup of butter to a 
cream and, after 
beating in the yolks 
of two eggs, with 
a dash of salt and 
pepper, cooking the 
mixture with one- 
fourth a cup of boil- 
ing water and a table- 
spoonful of lemon 
juice over hot water 
until it thickens. 
Dip the edges of the 
toasted muffins in boiling salted water, 
and spread lightly with butter, then 
cover with the ham. Place the eggs 
above the ham, and pour the sauce 
over the eggs. 



Scrambled Eggs, Reformed Style 
Turn four tabic spoonfuls of milk into 
an agate frying-pan, and add half a 
teaspoonful of salt. Beat four eggs 
with a silver fork just 
enough to thoroughly 
break the yolks. Then 
turn the egg into the hot 
milk. Cook over a gentle 
fire, stirring as the egg 
thickens, and adding, now 
and then, a bit of butter, 
until two table spoonfuls 
have been used. When 
lightly set, turn onto a hot 
serving-dish. 

Cauliflower-and-Beet Salad 
Let a cauliflower stand, head down- 
ward, in cold, salted water an hour, 
then tie in a cheese-cloth, and cook in 
boiling salted water until tender, no 
longer. When cold, separate the cauli- 
flower into flowerets, trim each stalk 
neatly, and dispose on heart leaves of 
curly lettuce. Put a spoonful of may- 
onnaise in the leaves with the cauli- 
flower or serve this apart. Have 
ready beets cooked tender, cut in thin 
slices, then stamped into rings. Dress 
these with oil, vinegar, salt, and pepper. 



Eggs Benedict 

Use equal measures of oil and vinegar. 
Dispose a ring on each floweret. Add 
a few fanciful figures (cut from beet) 
here and there, and serve at once. Use 
a patty cutter to shape the rings.

Jellied Apples, Casserole Style 

Select firm, tart apples that are not 
over-ripe. Pare, quarter, and core, 
then cut the quarters in lengthwise 
slices. Allow one cup and a half of 
sugar to each quart of slices. Put the 
slices of apple and the sugar into a 
casserole in alternate layers. Cover, 
and let cook in a moderate oven several 
hours, or until the apples are tender 
and red. Carefully measure the apples, 
and to each scant quart add half a 
package of gelatine softened in half 
a cup of cold water. Take care to 
keep the slices as whole as possible 
while adding the gelatine. Turn into 
a mould, and set aside to become firm. 
Decorate just before serving with a cup 
of double cream and one-fourth a cup 
of sugar beaten solid, or with twice this 
amount of thin cream, beaten with a 
whip churn. 

Tomato Preserve 

Select small green tomatoes, remove 
the stems, but do not cut them. Allow 
half or three-fourths a pound of sugar 
to each pound of tomatoes. Weigh the 
fruit, then the sugar. Put the sugar 
into the preserving kettle with a cup 
of water to each pound, let cook to a 
thin syrup, then add a sliced lemon — 
seeds removed — for each two pounds of 
tomatoes, and the tomatoes. Cook the 
tomatoes until tender, taking care to 
keep them whole. Remove to a jar 
with a skimmer. Cook the syrup until 
well reduced > then pour over the fruit. 



There should be enough syrup to cover 
the tomatoes. Ginger root may be

of two eggs, then fold in the whites of 
two eggs, beaten dry. Turn into a 
buttered baking-dish, and bake in a 
pan of hot water about forty minutes. 
Serve at once with cream, whipped or 
plain. 

Apples, French Style 

Pare sour apples, cut them in halves 
crosswise, and remove the cores. Cook 
in a light syrup (one cup of sugar to 
a cup of water), taking care to retain 
the shape. Drain the apples, and set 
each half on a round of stale sponge 
cake, sprinkled lightly with orange 
juice, and spread with apple or apricot 
marmalade. Cover the apple with a 
meringue or boiled frosting, sprinkle 
with sugar and chopped almonds, and 
set into the oven to brown delicately. 
Serve hot or cold. 

A Kitchen Wagon 

The top and shelf of the kitchen 
wagon, shown in the illustration on 
page 154, are covered with zinc. By 
this means a frying-pan or utensil from 
the cooking range may be set. down 
upon it, while the food in the utensil 
is being dished, without injury to the 
table. The zinc can also be cleaned 
without effort. The hooks on the sides 
give places to hang the utensils most 
in use about the range, while the cas- 
tors permit its being moved with ease 
and at will.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 



THE most of us go through life 
without knowing the simple 
little things needful to keep 
in health. In a general way we know 
that fresh air is good, yet our houses 
arid lungs are poorly ventilated. Often 
neither is filled with fresh air for days 
at a time. 

We know that exercise is good, but 
we say that the exercise taken during 
our daily round of duties is quite 
enough for us, others may need more. 
We fail to realize that it is exercise of 
all the muscles of the body, and not 
undue exercise of a portion of them, 
that makes for perfect health. The 
wise woman has control of all the 
muscles of her body. You think you 
have. Try expanding and contracting 
the muscles at the sides or back, three 
or four inches above the waist line. 
Until one has absolute control over 
these muscles, she cannot breathe so as 
to fill with air every part of the lungs; 
and it has come to be well known that 
deep breathing, in connection with ap- 
propriate food, is the panacea for most 
of the ills woman is heir to. 

Walking in the open air is the best 
of exercise; but you say "you never 
could walk, and that you walk enough 
about the house." Did you ever mis- 
trust that the reason "you never could 
walk" lay in the fact that you do not 
know how to walk or to stand? Note 



how the daughter of your friend who 
is taking lessons in physical culture 
stands. The upper body sways slightly 
forward and the spine is nearly per- 
pendicular, while the weight of the 
body is over the balls of the feet 
rather than the heels. It rests you 
to look at her; for, whether she be 
young or old, she does not look "so 
tired." 

These are little things the observ- 
ance of which puts us into a condition 
to attend to our household duties with 
the buoyancy and pleasure that comes 
from perfect health. Are our daily 
duties irksome? Do they look like a 
mountain to us? Let us suspect, at 
once, that there are some simple little 
things which we are not doing right, 
and put ourselves into a position to 
be better informed regarding them. 
Muscles may be trained more easily 
when one is young, but that need not 
deter us. We are never too old to 
learn. In fact, the only way to keep 
young is to keep on learning.

Cooking Wild Duck 

Last month we published a short 

article on the cooking of wild duck, 

but a few additional words may be of 



After Breakfast Chat

use. Sportsmen, and those of epi- 
curean taste, prefer wild duck quite 
rare. To roast, put a dozen cranber- 
ries inside, and cook the duck in a 
hot oven eighteen or twenty minute^ 
While these are cooking, set into the 
oven thin slices of choice, mild-cured 
bacon: rolled and fastened with tooth- 
picks, turn these as needed until they 
become crisp and browned throughout. 
Serve around the duck on rounds of 
cooked hominy, egged, crumbed, and 
fried. When available, green cranberry 
vines, bearing the ripe fruit, give an 
attractive finish to the dish. To serve, 
cut the meat from the breast in thin 
slices and parallel to the breast bone. 
Usually, only the breast of wild duck 
is served. 

A machine, costing about $40, has 
been devised by which the juice in 
the carcass of the duck, after the 
breast has been sliced, may be ex- 
pressed for sauce. The price, however, 
renders these scarce. But the rest of 
the duck need not; on any account, be 
thrown away. Take off the wing and 
leg joints, and break the body in 
pieces. Add the giblets and a cup of 
celery, cut in inch lengths, cover the 
whole with boiling water, and let sim- 
mer two hours, or until the meat and 
celery are tender. Put the legs and 
wings in a buttered baking-dish. Re- 
move bits of meat from the bones, 
and add them to the dish. Add also 
the giblets and the celery with the 
broth, which should be well reduced 
when the meat is cooked. Sprinkle 
with salt and paprika, dredge in a very 
little flour, dot here and there with 
bits of butter, and cover the whole 
with a crust cut to fit the dish and 
with an opening in the top. The crust 
may be of rich biscuit dough, rolled 
thin, or of pie paste. Bake until the 
crust is well browned. Glaze, when 
baked, by brushing the top with a tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch, wet in cold 
water and cooked five minutes in boil- 



ing water. Return the pie to the oven 
for a few minutes after it has been 
brushed over with the glaze. The pie 
is intended to be eaten when hot, but, 
as the broth jellies on cooling, the pie 
is eminently satisfactory when cold. 

Sweet Potatoes 

Sweet potatoes and yams are now 
at their best. Though the ways of 
cooking them are many, no one of 
these is preferable, except for variety, 
to plain baking, which conserves all 
their sweetness. For broiling, cooked 
potatoes are required, peeled and cut 
in slices. These may be spread with 
butter, and cooked between the bars 
of a double broiler, over a bed of not 
too glowing coals. Candied sweet po- 
tatoes are parboiled and sliced, then 
sprinkle with butter and maple or 
other sugar, and bake in an oven, bast- 
ing occasionally with the syrup in the 
dish. Then there are creamed and 
scalloped sweet potatoes, sweet potato 
puff, croquettes and boulettes, and 
sweet potato puree in cases. 

Agua Cate 

The agua cate shown in our illustra- 
tion grew in Cuba. They are found, 
also, growing wild, in Mexico and other 
countries of same latitude. On the 
table of the steamers, running between 
these countries and New York, agua 
cate salad is welcomed three times a 
day. The fruit or vegetable, which- 
ever is the proper classification, does 
not have a pronounced flavor, but like 
the banana is well calculated to carry 
other flavors that have become agree- 
able to us, and on this account a liking 
for it is easily acquired." When newly 
cut, the flesh is yellow, and resembles 
butter in appearance. Tomatoes, 
onions, and green peppers are usually 
combined with them, the quantity de- 
pending on individual taste. On ac- 
count of the large quantity of liquid 
drained from the mixture during prep-

aration, more salt than ordinary will be 
called for. 

Fish Forcemeat Moulded with 

Truffles 

In our illustration of fish forcemeat, 
moulded in fish-shaped mould, the 
mould is fashioned to simulate the 
scales, fins, eye, etc., of a fish. Into 
the indentations of the mould, which 
was first heavily buttered, were pressed 
tiny bits of truffle. As a small can of 
truffles costs about sixty cents, the 
dish would seem expensive. This is 
not the case, however, if truffles will 
be again in demand before much time 
has elapsed. A single truffle cut in 
very thin slices will suffice to decorate 
the mould. The others may be kept 
by covering with sherry or white wine, 
and then tying a piece of oiled paper 
over the whole, to exclude the air. The 
wine may be used afterward in mak- 



ing sauces. If preferred, the fat of 
bacon or poultry, heated very hot, 
may replace the wine. 

Chestnuts are now in good condition, 
either to cook for immediate use or to 
preserve in syrup for future use in 
sweetmeats. . Learn how to shell and 
blanch these easily, and they will well 
repay one for all the labor involved in 
their preparation. With a sharp- 
pointed knife cut a short slit in the 
shell on one side. Cover with boiling 
water, let cook two or three minutes, 
then drain. Add a teaspoonful of but- 
ter for each pint of nuts, stir and shake 
over the fire or in the oven three or 
four minutes, then with a pointed 
knife the skin and shell may be easily 
removed together. Keep the nuts hot 
and moist (by covering with a heavy 
cloth) until the shelling is completed. 
When shelled, they are ready for use in 
any dish in which chestnuts are used. 



The Up-to-Date Waitress 

By Janet M. Hill 
Third Paper 



What are the Duties of a Waitress ? 

THAT house is well ordered 
where each inmate knows what 
is expected of her, and lives 
up to these expectations. Then there 
is no creaking of the domestic ma- 
chinery, and the comfort which the 
home should assure is attained. Each 
maid is engaged to further the comfort 
of the family in some particular line 
or lines, and, if her presence does not 
secure the end desired, there is no 
reason why she should be retained. 

In the great majority of homes where 
a waitress is employed, she is expected 
to render quite diversified services. 
Often the entire work of the household 



is performed by herself and one other 
maid. Yet in all households the chief 
duties of a waitress centre around the 
serving of the meals, and hold a certain 
kinship to this part of the household 
routine. In short, first of all the 
waitress is expected to render" such 
service as will result in the serving of 
the meals in a neat and orderly manner, 
and, when circumstances permit, with 
due regard to the prevailing fashion of 
the day. The other duties that a 
waitress may be called upon to do 
vary with the style in which the house 
is conducted or with the number of 
employees in the household staff. 
Often the special duties of chamber 



The Up-to-Date Waitress 



161 



and parlor maid need be performed by 
the waitress; and, though it may not 
seem so at first glance, the duties of 
a waitress are often much more oner- 
ous in houses where a large retinue of 
help is employed than where the en- 
tire work of the household is carried 
on by a cook and waitress. In the 
latter case the diversity of the work 
tends to break up what is liable to 
become a tedious routine. 

While the dining-room and pantry 
are the special domain of the waitress, 
still, when laundry work is done in the 
house, the whole care of the table 
linen from laundry to linen closet is 
often included in the work of a "second 
girl." So, also, when no man is em- 
ployed about the house, and the work 
is divided with the cook, sweeping the 
front piazza, cleaning the mat thereon, 
and polishing the brasses upon the 
door would naturally be done by the 
waitress, while the cook is attending 
to that part of the house that adjoins 
the kitchen. 

Besides this house service a waitress 
may be called upon to perform such 
personal service as the habits of the 
family render needful, as perhaps to 
leave the juice of a lemon and k cup 
and pitcher of hot water at one room, 
at a certain hour in the morning, or 
a cup of hot coffee or tea or a bowl of 
gruel, at another room. If no ladies' 
maid or nurse be kept, and the break- 
fast be very simple, it may prove more 
conducive to the comfort of the family, 
if the waitress lay the breakfast table 
the night beforehand, and thus be left 
free in the morning to assist in the 
toilet of an elderly woman or child. 
But such, duties are generally spoken 
of, and their performance or non- 
performance agreed upon, before con- 
tract for work and pay is entered into 
by the respective parties. In general, 
the duties of a waitress are of a com- 
paratively light character. They call for 
neatness, despatch, accuracy, and tact. 



The up-to-date waitress needs an eye 
quick to see and a hand deft to execute. 

The Dining-room and its 
Furnishings 

The usual furnishings of a dining- 
room are a rug upon which the dining- 
table stands, chairs, a sideboard, and 
a serving-table. Screens are desirable 
to shut off too generous a blaze from 
the open fire, a draught from an open 
window, or the entrance to a pantry. 
One or two cabinets for the storing of 
choice china and glass add to the at- 
'tractiveness of the room. 

In some handsome houses a sunny 
room, smaller and less elaborately deco- 
rated and furnished than the dining- 
room, is set apart as the "breakfast 
room." And this, like the dining 
room, opens into the pantry. Occa- 
sionally a large alcove or bay window 
at one end or side of the dining-room 
is supplied with table, chairs, and china 
cabinet, and is thus made the break- 
fast room. When this "room" is re- 
mote from the pantry, a breakfast 
warmer upon the serving-table adds 
to the ease with which the breakfast 
may be served. This warmer, which 
is of copper, is supplied with one or 
more alcohol lamps, and in the tray 
over the lamps water, coffee, and milk 
for the coffee may be kept hot until the 
moment they are needed. Ample space 
may be found, also, for a double boiler 
of cereal, creamed potato, or meat. 

The top of the sideboard is the proper 
place for extra plates, tumblers, knives, 
forks, spoons, napkins, and cold viands, 
as bread, sliced meat, butter, cream, 
milk, water, etc. No hot articles are 
given place on the sideboard. The 
side table is the receptacle on which 
all hot viands are disposed. 

The Pantry and its Furnishings 

The pantry (sometimes there are 
two) is situated between the kitchen 
and dining-room, and opens into each 



l6l 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



by swinging doors that make no noise; 
nor are these directly opposite each 
other. The pantry should be well 
lighted. The walls of the pantry are 
lined with enclosed shelves for china 
and glass, cupboards for the storing 
of jelly, preserves, pickles, sauces, 
and cheese designed for immediate use 
in the dining-room. There are also 
drawers for dish towels, salad cloths, 
etc. A handsome sink supplied with 
hot and cold water, and with ample 
shelf space around it, makes the wash- 
ing of table ware a positive pleasure. 
If the refrigerator have several com-' 
partments, let each be kept for a spec- 
ial purpose, as one for green salad 
materials, washed, dried, and wrapped 
in cheese-cloth, or for cooked salad 
materials set aside in a marinade. 
Another compartment might be re- 
served for cream, plain or whipped, a 
bottle of milk, and the butter, stamped 
or rolled into portions for the table. 

Styles of Serving Meals 

Perhaps the best way to give direc- 
tions for serving a meal is to present 
a representative menu, and tell how 
to get it before those who are seated 
at table. In "Practical Cooking and 
Serving," mention is made of two dis- 
tinct styles of serving meals, the Eng- 
lish and the Russian, also of a third 
style, "the compromise, 1 ' which empha- 
sizes the best points of the other two. 

Russian Service 

When a meal is served after the 
Russian fashion, all the responsibility 
of supplying food to those at table falls 
upon the attendants. It follows, then, 
that, where this fashion is adopted, a 
full staff of trained household em- 
ployees is needed, if the wants of those 
at table are to be properly supplied. 
Dinner is the meal for which this formal 
service is best adapted, and even at 
dinner it should not be carried out in 
its entirety unless there be more than 



one waitress for each eight covers at 
table, since nothing appears upon the 
table save the centre-piece (at dinner 
a bonbon dish or two is allowable) and 
the articles that compose the individual 
covers. All food is served "from the 
side"; i.e., by attendants who pass the 
food, separated into portions, to the 
left of those at table, for each to help 
himself, or, made ready on individual 
plates, it is set down before each indi- 
vidual from the right. 

English Service 

The English style of service breathes 
hospitality rather than formality. It 
allows of personal attention, on the part' 
of those sitting at the head and foot 
of the table, to the needs of those 
about them. The food is served "from 
the table." The meat or fish just as 
it is taken from the oven or kettle, ex- 
cept for its garnish, is set down before 
the "head of the house," who carves 
it and selects the portion desired by 
each. Place, also, is found upon the 
table for one or two vegetables, which 
are served, by some one at the table. 
Bread and butter, pickles and relishes, 
are also given a place on the table. 
But, save relishes, etc., only one course 
appears at a time upon the table. 

Compromise Style of Service 

The compromise style of service is, 
as its name implies, a "let down" from 
the formality of the Russian service 
and a "let up" to the arduous duties 
expected of the head of the house at 
an English table. This style of ser- 
vice is largely practised at luncheons 
and "little dinners," and should be 
the favorite style, where one has a 
cook proficient in giving those final 
touches to a dish that remove it at 
once from the realm of the common- 
place to that of the artistic world. 
The illustrations show the laying of 
side table, and sideboard for a break 
fast served in the Russian fashion.

Mrs. Janet M. Him Editor Cooking- 
School Magazine: 

My dear Mrs. Hill, — I have taken the 
Cooking-School Magazine this year, buy- 
ing it at the bookstore, and I read it 
with much interest and profit. 

The menus and recipes are very help- 
ful; and the articles on food values 
and home-making, generally, are all 
encouraging. 

I was much interested in reading 
Mrs. L. F. W.'s query (No. 880) in the 
May magazine; and it is possible to 
feed a family of two adults and three 
growing children on $25 a month, but 
it is difficult, where one has. to buy every- 
thing. 

I would like so much to have a menu 
list for a month made out on that scale, 
but think you could not do it from 
practical experience. I have done this 
for a long time, but find we cannot 
afford luxuries, as much as we like 
them. 

Our fare would seem extremely 
meagre to many, as it does to us many 
times. I do not wish to trespass on 
your time, but I will tell you something 
of the way we do. 

My husband is a shipping clerk. We 
have two girls in the high school and 
one in the grammar school. We were 
brought up to have everything we 
wanted, and had no idea of the value 
of money. We had to learn from hard 
experience. 

My weekly marketing is something 
like this, at present: — 

Sugar, .75; 3 pounds lard, .30; 
butter, .48 (2 pounds) ; 2 yeast cakes, 
.04; wheat biscuit, .20 (2 packages); 



whole wheat flour, .50; baking-powder, 
.15; 1 dozen eggs, .22 (sometimes two 
dozen) ; 1 pound salt pork, .09; 1 quart 
pea beans, .08 ; can salmon, .12; gelatine, 
.15; 2 boxes of berries, .25; cucumbers, 
.10 (2); string beans, .10 (2 quarts); 
fish for chowder, .16 (2 pounds); 2 
pounds onions, .10; fish for frying or 
baking, .25; peck of potatoes, .35; 
5 pounds beef, .40 (bought fresh so as 
to use the broth); macaroni, .15; can 
of tomatoes, .10; 1 pound cheese, .16; 
1 pound coffee, .25; a quart and a half 
of milk a day. For breakfast we have 
either corn-cake, wheat biscuit, grape- 
nuts, or graham rolls, doughnuts, coffee. 
Sometimes we cook eggs, and liver and 
bacon, fish hash, or meat hash. I do 
not make pies, thinking they are not 
healthful for growing children. Some 
weeks I bake beans, but not always. 

For puddings I make cottage, gela- 
tine, tapioca, rice, or some simple 
pudding with sauce. We cannot afford 
cream, and milk, taken at night, affords 
cream for coffee and cereal pudding. 

In winter, we buy one week a six- 
pound roast, and at another a good- 
sized piece of corned beef, with different 
vegetables, as it gives variety; and 
we find it more economical to buy a 
large piece of beef. We eat very little 
pork, occasionally buy a smoked shoul- 
der, boiled. We make veal loaf and 
beef loaf. I liked the rule for "white 
cake," in the magazine for February, 
as I use the yolks of the three eggs for 
a custard. This may not be helpful to 
any one; but I am watching constantly 
for articles to help me in my planning, 
and others may be doing likewise. I

make bread, using one-half whole- wheat 
flour. This also makes nice biscuit 
and gingerbread. 

In winter, we drink cocoa, in summer, 
iced tea, lemonade, and water. My 
husband likes hot water with milk, for 
cool nights, at supper. Thanking you 
very much for your helpful magazine, 
I am, Sincerely, 

M. P. Q. 

Old Philadelphia Recipes for 
Kidneys 

PHILADELPHIA is noted for good 
things to eat. Many of them are 
not to be obtained elsewhere, as they 
are made from treasured family recipes, 
handed down from mother to daughter, 
from the grandes dames of old colonial 
days. These recipes given for kidneys 
are locally famous. 

An excellent old-fashioned breakfast 
for Sunday morning, still adhered to by 
many, consists of fricassee of kidneys 
with the inseparable accompaniment of 
broiled bacon. Serve also Lyonnaise 
potatoes, hot rolls, and strong, fra- 
grant, drip coffee, clear as amber. When 
canteloupes are in season, serve small 
spicy ones, thoroughly chilled, as a 
first course, and let them be eaten in 
the true Philadelphia way, with salt 
and pepper. If a more elaborate break- 
fast be desired, as a dainty final course 
a souffle au rhum is excellent, the blaz- 
ing omelet taking the place of hot cakes 
with syrup. 

To parboil and blanch kidneys.— To 
serve kidneys in perfection, every detail 
of the directions now given must be faith- 
fully followed. Engage them on Fri- 
day, that they may be delivered soon 
after breakfast on Saturday. Two will 
be required for each of the first two 
recipes and one only for the recipe with 
mushrooms. Have them cut from 
choice young beef. If in perfect con- 
dition, they will be bright red in color, 
with firm white fat; and they will have 



a clear, bright gloss. If they have lost 
their gloss and have a dark and withered 
appearance, reject them. They spoil 
easily, and must not remain in the hot 
kitchen. When the butcher delivers 
them, if the cook cannot give them her 
immediate attentioft, they should be 
placed at once in the refrigerator. As 
soon as possible they should be cut up, 
and put on to parboil, as they must be 
kept gently simmering nearly all day. 
In cutting them open, the inside will be 
found to be darker in color and of a 
bluish tinge. This must be cut away 
and rejected, together with every trace 
of white fat. The bright red portion 
outside alone must be used. Cut this 
into half -inch cubes, wash, and put into 
a porcelain-lined kettle, with cold water 
to cover well. Bring to the boiling- 
point, then draw aside to simmer only. 
Add a mild white onion, the size of an 
English walnut, 'and cover the kettle 
closely. A thick scum will form, but do 
not disturb it. In two hours strain 
the broth through a fine sieve into a 
bowl. Hold the sieve containing the 
kidneys, after removing the onion and 
throwing it away, under the cold water 
faucet, and wash the kidney thoroughly 
until clear and free from all scum. This 
also blanches it. Rinse out the kettle, 
and return to it the kidney and strained 
broth. Bring again to the boiling- 
point, season very delicately with salt 
and white pepper, then cover the kettle. 
It is important to remember that the 
slow simmering process must continue 
nearly all day. Rapid boiling must not 
occur at any time, or the kidney will 
be toughened and an otherwise de- 
licious dish utterly ruined. When it 
is so tender that a kitchen fork will 
almost sink into it of its own weight, 
remove from the fire. It must remain 
in the refrigerator over night, well 
covered with its own broth in a covered 
bowl. 

Brown Fricassee of Kidney. — Having 
parboiled and blanched two kidneys as 



Home Ideas and Economies 



i6 5 



described, on Sunday morning, just as 
breakfast is to be served, drain the 
Sidney from the broth. Into the 
cleanest of porcelain-lined saucepans 
put a rounded tablespoonful of the best 
butter . and a teaspoonful ' of fine- 
minced, white onion. When the butter 
boils, add a heaping tablespoonful of 
sifted flour, and stir until it acquires 
a rich nut-brown color, taking care not 
to let it blacken or burn. The rich 
color is essential. The bright red- 
brown of a ripe chestnut is the exact 
tint desired. Stir in a half -pint of the 
broth, and, when the sauce boils 
smooth and thickens, add the well 
drained kidney and two hard-boiled 
eggs, chopped not too fine. Add more 
salt and white pepper as required, 
cayenne pepper to taste, and one- 
third a level teaspoonful of powdered 
mustard diluted with a little of the hot 
sauce. As soon as the kidney is heated 
through, not letting it reboil, remove 
from the fire, and flavor with three or 
four tablespoonfuls of fine old sherry or 
Madeira. It is delicious. 

Around the edge of a hot platter 
arrange a thick, close border of fresh, 
bright parsley sprigs, broken into two- 
inch lengths. Place the hot kidney in 
the centre, garnish with thin slices or 
curls of grilled bacon, and serve with- 
out delay. 

Brown Fricassee of Kidney (No. II). — 
Follow exactly the directions given in 
the first recipe, but omit the hard-boiled 
eggs and mustard. Instead, add a little 
grated nutmeg or mace, and just as it is 
removed from the fire stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of two raw eggs. This 
recipe calls for more wine than the first 
one, as much as two sherry-glassfuls 
or even a gill not being considered too 
much. Old wine of a choice vintage is 
deemed one of the essentials of these 
famous old dishes. 

Fricassee of Kidney with Mush- 
rooms. — Open a bottle of the best 
French mushrooms, drain and quarter, 



then mix them with a parboiled-and- 
blanched kidney, cut up. 

Melt a piece of butter a little larger 
than an egg, adding a teaspoonful of 
grated onion. When it begins to color, 
add a rounded tablespoonful of flour, 
and stir until it turns nut-brown. Then 
add about half a gill of mushroom es- 
sence from the bottle and sufficient 
broth from the kidney to make a sauce 
that will mask the spoon. When 
smooth, add the mushrooms and kid- 
ney, and season with salt, white pepper, 
cayenne, a little grated nutmeg or 
mace. Just as you are ready to remove 
it from the fire, stir in the well-beaten 
yolks of two eggs, diluted with a little 
of the hot sauce. Add sherry or Mad- 
eira to taste, either three or four table- 
spoonfuls or a gill. Garnish with pars- 
ley and bacon as described in the first 
recipe. This is a more modern recipe 
than the former two, but equally de- 
licious. Catherine Stuart. 



A Discovery 

IT is only round steak; you may think 
it hardly worth mentioning. But, if 
you are trying to set your table well 
and give your family a variety of food 
on an extremely limited income, in these 
days when the cow has literally " jumped 
over the moon," you may be as glad of 
it as I am; for it is the most adaptable 
meat on the market. Chopped, and 
broiled on a well-oiled broiler, and 
served with a sprinkle of salt and a 
little butter on a hot platter, it needs no 
apology. It may be seasoned with salt 
and pepper, have a little fat pork 
chopped with it, and made into tiny 
round cakes and fried in a hot frying- 
pan, and it is good. Again, chop and 
mould it into small cakes. Fry three 
or four onions in a little butter or fat 
trimmed from the steak, take out the 
onions and put in your meat cakes, 
and brown them nicely on both sides, 
then serve on a hot platter with the 



66 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



onions, and see if your hungry boys 
despise it. 

•Another way of using this steak makes 
a satisfactory dinner. Trim off all the 
fat, and cut the steak in inch pieces. 
Flour a casserole, or, lacking that, a 
bean-pot answers nicely. Put in a 
layer of meat, dredge with flour and a 
little salt and pepper, add a few bits of 
butter, and continue in this way until 
all the steak is used. Cover the meat 
with cold water, then cover the re- 
ceptacle, and let cook slowly in the 
oven three or four hours. Serve on a 
hot platter with tender baking-powder 
biscuit. You may vary this dish by 
adding potatoes, carrots, and sliced 
onions, if you wish a nice stew. The 
long, slow cooking gives the gravy a 
delicious flavor. 

Another way to serve this most use- 
ful and nutritious cut of beef is to chop 
with a little green pepper and onion 
juice, broil, and serve on a platter with 
broiled tomatoes and macaroni in a 
cream sauce. 

Mock Duck. — When a slice of round 
steak is spread with a dressing of bread 
crumbs, any herbs you please, salt and 
pepper, rolled up, fastened securely, 
and baked in a moderate oven with fre- 
quent basting, we call it mock duck. 
It is also good. 

We like this steak best cooked in a 
canelon. A pound of steak is put 
through the meat-grinder, seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and onion juice, mixed 
with dry bread crumbs (half a cup), 
which have previously been softened 
in cold water or milk, and one beaten 
egg. It is then made into a roll, 
seared all over in a hot frying-pan, 
dredged with flour, and baked in a 
quick oven half an hour, with frequent 
basting with hot water. Sometimes it 
is served with macaroni in a tomato 
sauce on the platter with it, but the 
tomato sauce is not omitted, if the 
macaroni is. 

These ways of cooking round steak 



have been clipped from various sources, 
and more than one of them has already 
appeared in the Boston Cooking-School 
Magazine. Sometimes, when the house- 
work seems drudgery, just try serving 
round steak every day for a week in 
a different guise, and see if it isn't in- 
teresting. Edith O. Roberts. 



An Incident 

ONE morning as I sat visiting with 
a friend, my six-year-old son John 
ran into the room, saying, "Mother, 
may I go out doors to play?" 

His request being granted, he started 
out through the front of the house. 
"Go out the other way, John," I called 
after him. 

"I prefer to go this way, mother." 

"Very well, there is no reason why 
you should not; but remember, if 
your shoes are dirty when you are 
through playing in the yard, there 
will be a reason why you should 
come in the other way." 

"All right!" And away he went. 

My friend glanced after him, and then, 
turning to me, said: "Why did you 
allow him to go out that way after you 
told him to go the other way? John 
has always been a model of obedience 
at our house. Is that your method of 
government?" 

"Yes, if you choose to call it method. 
Theory and method have their value, 
but dogmatism sacrifices so many chil- 
dren that I have become almost afraid 
of the very word. Theory is a light to 
be thrown upon the individual child; 
but the child is to be developed, not 
the theory." 

"But tell me why you allowed him 
to go out the front door." 

"The request was made thought- 
lessly. There was no reason why he 
should not go. I never insist on my 
way out of anything, unless I have a 
reason for doing so. Some one has 
said, 'When you have no reason for 



i 



Home Ideas and Economies 



167 



doing a thing, you have one very good 
reason for not doing it.' 

"Self-reliance is a very important 
factor in one's success in life, and my 
observation has led me to believe that 
more people fail from a lack of it than 
from the possession of self-conceit. 
How can you expect a child to develop 
self-reliance, if you are dogmatic enough 
to teach him that there is but one way, 
and that your way ? He must be taught 
to think for himself. When he learns 
by experience that mother has a reason 
for being obeyed, there is little evidence 
of discipline necessary in the home. 

"Early this spring it was necessary 
for me to allow the man to scrub the 
front porch and steps late in the after- 
noon, just about the time John was 
dressed for the evening. Several times 
I had refused his-request to go out with 
James while the scrubbing was being 
done, saying I was afraid he would get 
wet. He accepted my decision agree- 
ably; but each day the desire seemed 
to take stronger possession of him, and 
the request was sure to come before the 
scrubbing had been completed. Finally 
I answered in this wise : 'John, mother 
has told you several times that you 
could not go. I do not think best for 
you to go to-day. It is chilly, and I 
fear you will get wet and catch cold; 
but to-day you may do as you think 
best. Only remember that, should 
you get your shoes wet while James is 
using the hose, you must come in and 
change them at once; and you cannot 
go out again until the shoes are dry 
and cleaned.' After a few moments' 
pause he said, 'If I go, will you feel 
cross?'. 'No, I do not think best, that 
is all.' 

"He put on his cap, and out he went. 
It was only a little while before he was 
sitting on the library floor, taking off a 
pair of very wet shoes. I said nothing; 
but every little while I saw him taking 
the shoes off the register, to see if they 
were dry, only to put them back again. 



The other children came out upon the 
pavement for their early evening frolic. 
John stood looking wistfully out of the 
window. I never mentioned the wet 
shoes. Presently he said, 'Mother, will 
my shoes soon be dry?' 'I think not 
this evening,' I replied, and immediately 
changed the subject. That night as I 
put him to bed, he put his arms around 
my neck to say good-night, and whis- 
pered in my ear, 'Mother, next time I 
am not going to do my way : I am going 
to do as you think best.' 

"That little lesson was a most help- 
ful one. 'Why* is not nearly as frequent 
a question when I refuse his requests. 
He is learning that mother always 
has a reason, and experience has often 
taught him that her reasons are good." 

Such methods are not always prac- 
tical; but, if mothers and teachers 
would avail themselves of such oppor- 
tunities, they would find it worth while. 
It establishes a confidence in their 
judgment, and makes the child think, 
and develops his power of reasoning. 
If he finds that his way is to be con- 
sidered, he is more cautious in his 
decisions; for the child is as pleased 
with satisfactory results as we are. 

Over the Dish-pan 

DISH-WASHING is considered the 
worst drudgery of housekeeping. 
No wonder, when one notices how few 
women go about it with system. Usu- 
ally, all the dishes of the first course 
are piled into the sink just as they are 
taken- from the table; and, when the 
dessert service is brought out, those 
dishes, too, are heterogeneously heaped, 
to be arranged when that dreaded of all 
times, dish-washing, comes. 

There are thousands of women who 
have to do cooking, serving, presiding 
at table, and dish-washing besides; 
and by a little care and thought the 
greater part of the latter drudgery 
may be eliminated.

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



If one be a good housekeeper, and 
loves her profession, as all should, why, 
she may take a natural delight in pre- 
paring and serving in as dainty and 
appetizing a manner as possible her 
meals; but her interest and pleasure 
dies the moment she thinks of the 
"cleaning up" process. 

Let me account for how one woman 
plans this part of her work, so that it 
brings more of pleasure than of pain. 

If, unfortunately, one has no hot 
water tank, have, above all things, hot 
water, and plenty of it, on the stove. 
Resort to any memory- jogging method, 
that this most important item may not 
be forgotten. 

Then, if there is not an opportunity 
to wash up the cooking utensils as they 
are used, clear a place for them on a 
side table. Place the largest kettle or 
vessel first, and pile into this all the 
smaller utensils as you are through 
with them. Throw a dipper of water 
over these, as it will loosen much matter 
that would be otherwise hard to get off. 

Be sure, also, to put water into all 
saucepans, baking-dishes, and frying- 
pans. This can be done at any time, 
as you pass the range, so that extra 
steps may not be taken. 

Next, clear the sink, and put into it 
two dish-pans. Clear off the kitchen 
table, too, as you pass to and fro, never 
losing a chance to put something in its 
place. Then, as the serving is in 
progress, and the baking-dishes are 
scraped, set two of them near the dish- 
pans in the sink, fill with water, and 
they are ready to receive, one the forks 
and knives, and the other the spoons, 
as they come from the dining-room. 

A serving table greatly facilitates 
matters in the dining-room; and, if it 
be not too dainty, it may be made to 
hold first course dishes as they are 
taken from the table. 

Now, when the meal is finished and 
the guests or the family have left the 
dining-room, don't gather everything 



up in a hurry, and pile them pell-mell 
into the kitchen. First take off the 
edibles left over, and put them away 
in the cooler. Then take the things 
from the serving table, making piles 
of each kind of dish or plate on the 
kitchen table, which should be near the 
sink. Do with the silver as has already 
been arranged for. 

Next, in taking up the remaining 
dishes and silver from the dining table, 
arrange and carry to the kitchen in 
piles of each kind. This arrangement 
saves time in washing, saves water, — 
i.e., keeps it clean longer, — and saves 
time also in drying. 

Now, when the dining table has been 
cleared, the crumbs brushed up, and 
the floor brushed, the real business of 
dish-washing begins; and it is remark- 
able what a short time it will take, 
these preliminaries having been ob- 
served. If possible, have a wire basket 
in which to dip the dishes into hot water 
after the washing. Of course, begin 
with the glassware, and use soap or 
soap powder, in the first pan, and keep 
the rinsing water in the second pan 
hot continuously. 

Mary IsabbllE Davies. 



Economical Dishes 

TO make warmed-over mashed po- 
tatoes acceptable, put the pota- 
toes into a double kettle, and add milk, 
pepper and salt, and cheese that has 
been cut in small pieces. As the pota- 
toes become hot and the cheese melts, 
stir briskly. When all the cheese is 
melted, beat the potatoes hard, and 
serve. 

This is an economical dish when eggs 
are high-priced. Instead of frying 
eggs alone or scrambling them alone, 
take fewer eggs, and add crumbs of 
bread, bits of cheese, and milk to 
moisten. Stir all together. Season 
with pepper and salt. Cook as you 
would scrambled eggs.

For luncheon or supper try this: 
Take a can of mustard sardines. A 
large box of these sardines costs only 
12 cents. Split open each fish with 
care, and remove the long bone. Have 
ready a cream sauce made by stirring 
two tablespoonfuls of flour into two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, melted and 
bubbling, then adding one cup of milk, 
when flour and butter are well blended. 
Stir until thick. Then pour in slowly 
two eggs, beaten light. Cook three 
minutes, then carefully lay in the fish. 
When thoroughly heated, serve on 
slices of toast that have been quickly 
dipped into hot water, to which a bit 
of salt has been added. Some prefer 
to use a smaller number of the fish, 
perhaps, to make the taste less pro- 
nounced. Add salt to the cream gravy, 
if the fish is not salty. 

L. A. Scott. 

TO avoid the disagreeable task of 
washing the moulding-board, get 
sheets of heavy glazed wrapping-paper, 
about the size of the board, to spread 
over it. 

Biscuits, pie crust, etc., can be rolled 
out on the paper; and, if it is well 
floured, there is less liability of the 
paste sticking than if a board is used. 



When the baking is finished, shake 
off the flour and burn the paper or 
save to use again.

Those individuals who are seeking 
"something to do" and incidentally the 
means of obtaining a livelihood are ad- 
vised to cultivate frogs. A frog farm 
would be a paying investment, if the 
market men are to be believed. The 
growing demand for frogs as an article 
of epicurean diet is now recognized by 
the fishery commission of more than 
one State; and, as, it is needless to add, 
the supply is short, farmers are advised 
to take to raising frogs as well as poul- 



try and selling eggs. In fact, a great 
and new industry is foreshadowed by 
the efforts made this summer to- secure 
sufficient frogs to supply the clubs 
and big hotels in that centre of luxury, 
New York. For years frogs' legs 
have been a standard dainty. Now 
they are to be a standard necessity 
among thousands of patrons, who 
know what good eating is and have 
fastidious palates to gratify. — Boston

"Canst kitchen be furnished for $20? Our 
income is about $18 per week, and I am to 
do my own work. Wish my furnishings to 
be comfortable, but simple. Kindly enumerate 
the articles I shall need." 

Furnishing a Kitchen 
The sum mentioned is doubtless in- 
tended for the minor kitchen furnish- 
ings, as, at the present time, kitchens 
in rented homes or apartments are sup- 
plied with a range, sink, set tubs, etc. 
A refrigerator is of the first importance, 
unless one lives in a house with a light, 
airy cellar. An ice-box, a box with 
a single compartment for ice and all 
supplies, may be purchased for $5. 
A refrigerator, even a small one, costs 
much more. We give below a list of 
the most common kitchen utensils, but 
will not attempt to say which of them 
our correspondent should buy. An 
article which is an absolute necessity 
for one housekeeper is often considered 
a superfluous luxury by another. One

Query 920.— Mrs. F. W. S., Waterville, 
Me.: "Recipes for mustard pickles and pears 
preserved with ginger root." 

Mustard Pickles 

Use a mixture of small cucumbers, 
or large ones cut in pieces, green to- 
matoes sliced, cauliflower broken into 
flowerets, nasturtium seeds, string 
beans, green grapes, and button onions. 
Sprinkle these with salt and cover with 
water. Use about one pint of salt to 
six quarts of water. Let stand over 
night in the brine, then drain off the 
brine, scald, and pour it over the vege- 
tables. Let stand until cool, then 
drain again. For every gallon of vine- 
gar needed to cover the pickles take 
one-fourth a pound, each, of curry 
powder and mustard, half a teaspoon- 
ful of cayenne, one-fourth a pound of 
salt, and one pound of brown sugar. 
Heat the salt and sugar with the vine- 
gar, mix the curry powder, mustard, 
and cayenne with a little of the hot 
vinegar, and, when smooth and well 
diluted, add to the rest of the vinegar. 
Pour this scalding hot over the vege- 
tables. If a thicker consistency in the 
vinegar be desired, a cup of flour may 
be added with the curry powder and 
mustard. 



Pears Preserved with Ginger Root 

Pare the fruit, remove the cores, cut 
in halves, in lengthwise slices, or in 
small bits, as preferred. Weigh the 
fruit, then take three-fourths as much 
sugar as fruit, and about two ounces 
of green ginger root and a cup of water 
for each pound of fruit. Let the ginger 
root simmer in the water, to make a 
strong decoction of ginger. Strain the 
liquid over the sugar, let boil and skim, 
then add the pears, and cook until 
tender. Then skim the pears out of 
the syrup. Reduce the latter and pour 
over the pears. A sliced lemon may 
be added for each pound of fruit. 
Pears that are a little hard are prefer- 
able for this preserve. 



QuBry 921. — I. P. W., Revere, Mass. 
"How may rice be cooked so as to be dry, 
with each grain separate?" 

Cooking Rice 

As a rule, rice-growing people prefer 
the grains less tender than do those 
of northern climes. They also think 
rice improperly cooked unless each 
grain be distinct and dry. These re- 
sults can be secured more successfully, 
when the rice is cooked directly over 
the fire, than in a double boiler, and 
with a large rather than a small quan- 
tity of liquid. When the rice is cooked 
in water, the liquid, drained from the 
rice, may be used in soup. When milk, 
tomato pur6e, or stock, is used as all 
or a part of the liquid, it is usually 
more convenient to use only such a 
quantity as the rice will absorb. Rice 
needs to be thoroughly cleansed before 
cooking. It may be washed in several 
waters, being rubbed meanwhile be- 
tween the hands, but the most satisfac- 
tory way is to blanch it. Put the rice 
over a hot fire in a large saucepan of 
cold water, and stir, occasionally, while 
it is heating. Let boil five minutes, 
then drain on a sieve, and pass cold 
water from the faucet through it. The

rice will now be beautifully white and 
clean, with each grain distinct. Re- 
turn the rice to the fire in plenty (two 
or three quarts for a cup or half-pound 
of rice) of boiling, salted water, and 
let cook rapidly in an uncovered sauce- 
pan until the grains have reached the 
desired condition. Drain off the liquid, 
sprinkle the grains lightly with salt, 
cover the saucepan with a cloth, and 
set on the bade of the range to dry. 
Shake the dish' occasionally. Serve in 
a hot dish. 



QuBry 922. — Mrs. S. K. B., New Haven, 
Conn.: "Kindly repeat the recipe given last 
year for corn tim bales." 

Corn Timbales 

Cut down through the kernels of 
corn in each lengthwise row, then cut 
the kernels from the cob without cut- 
ting too close, and scrape out the pulp 
left on the cob. For one cup of this 
pulp, beat two eggs, add a few drops 
of onion juice, if desired, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, one fourth 
a cup of cream or milk, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and a dash of black pepper. 
Turn the mixture into buttered timbale 
moulds, let cook in the oven, set on 
several folds of paper. Surround the 
moulds' with water at the boiling-point. 
The water should not boil during the 
cooking. The timbales are cooked 
when they feel firm to the touch.

issue. 



it 



Currant Buns 

Soften a cake of compressed yeast in 
half a cup of scalded-and-cooled milk, 
and add to a pint of the same. Stir in 
about three cups of flour, beat until 
very smooth, then cover, and set to 
rise. When light, add half a cup of 
sugar, half a cup of softened butter, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three eggs, one cup 



of cleaned currants, and about three 
cups of flour. Knead until elastic, and 
set to rise. When doubled in bulk, roll 
out into a sheet and cut into rounds. 
Set the rounds, a little distance apart, 
on a baking-sheet, and, when nearly 
doubled in bulk, bake about twenty- 
five minutes. Brush over with thin 
starch (a teaspoonful of cornstarch to 
a cup of boiling water), sprinkle thickly 
with granulated sugar, and return to 
the oven to glaze. Repeat the brushing 
over with starch and sprinkling with 
sugar until a glaze of the desired thick- 
ness is attained. Do not glaze the 
buns until they are thoroughly baked.

cream, or part of each, and stir and 
cook until the sauce boils after all the 
milk has been added. Flavor with a 
few drops of onion juice or a few 
chopped mushrooms or parsley. A 
few drops of lemon juke, added now 
and then while making the sauce, are 
thought to keep the sauce white, and 
also improve the flavor. When the 
sauce is finished, stir in the prepared 
meat, and let the whole set over hot 
water while the meat becomes hot. 
Instead of adding the onion juice to 
the sauce, it may be sprinkled over 
the meat with a little salt and pepper, 
and the whole set aside until the sauce 
is prepared. 

Pumpkin Pie 

Pare the pumpkin, remove the seeds, 
and cut the pulp in small pieces. 
Steam or cook slowly in a little water 
until tender, then press through a sieve. 
Pour off the liquid, if the pumpkin be 
not dry. For one large pie take one 
cup and a fourth of pumpkin, half a 
cup of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of 
molasses, one beaten egg t half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, from three-fourths to 
one full tablespoonful of ginger, -and 
one cup of rich milk. Mix thoroughly, 
and turn into a pie plate lined with 
pastry as for a custard pie. Bake in 
a moderate oven until the crust is 
browned, and the centre feels firm to 
the touch.

spoonful of salt. Stir constantly until 
the mixture thickens, then stfr in the 
yolks of three eggs, beaten with one-

ing. 



Qubry 928. — Miss S. F. J., Kennebunkport, 
Me.: "In chafing-dish cookery, when is the 
blazer and when the hot-water pan to be 
used?" 

Blazer in Chafing-dish Cookery 

The blazer of a chafing-dish is used 
as a saucepan, a frying-pan, or as the 
upper part of a double boiler. To de- 
termine how to use the blazer, con- 
sider how you would cook the article, 
if you were using the kitchen range, 
and use the blazer accordingly. As, 
for instance, in melting butter, cooking 
flour in it, and then adding a liquid to 
make a sauce, calls for cooking in 
saucepan or blazer directly over the 
fire; while, if milk were to be scalded, 
and flour and butter creamed together, 
or flour mixed with liquid, were to be 
stirred into the hot milk, the cooking 
in both cases would be done over hot 
water. After a sauce has been made, 
and meat or fish is to be reheated in 
it or beaten eggs are to be added to 
it, the cooking, in all cases, is over hot 
water. Chops, fillets of steak, or a 
bird, are pan-broiled in a quick heat, 
whether tlie utensil in which they are 
cooked be a frying-pan proper or a 
blazer.

QuBRY 930. — Mrs. F. W. H., North Chelms- 
ford, Mass. : " Recipes for pfeffernuesse, spring- 
erlie and elderberry wine." 

Pfeffernuesse 

Pass together through a sieve two 
cups of sugar, four cups of flour, two 
(level) teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
one tablespoonful of cinnamon, and 
half a tablespoonful, each, of cloves, 
mace, and nutmeg. Add half a cup 
of fine-chopped citron and the grated 
rind of a lemon, then mix to a dough 
with five eggs beaten without sepa- 
rating the whites and yolks. With 
buttered hands shape the mixture into 
small balls, the size of hickory nuts. 
Bake on waxed or buttered paper, an 
inch apart, to a delicate brown, in a 
quick oven. The recipe makes seventy 
cakes. 

Springerlie 

Beat the yolks of four eggs until 
light-colored and thick, and the whites 
until dry, then beat together. Add 
the grated rind of a lemon, and very 
gradually beat in one pound of sugar 
(fine granulated). Lastly beat in one 
pound of flour sifted with one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of salt and a scant tea- 
spoonful (level measurement) of bak- 
ing-powder. Add the last of the flour 
very cautiously, as all may'not be re- 
quired. Knead the dough, and cover 
closely with an earthen bowl. Let 



chill two or three hours, then roll, a 
small piece at a time, into a sheet 
one-eighth an inch thick. Dredge the 
dough very lightly with flour, then 
press a wooden springerlie mould down 
very hard upon the dough, so as to 
leave a perfect impress of the pictures 
upon the dough. Cut out the little 
squares with a knife, and set aside 
over night on a board lightly floured. 
In the morning transfer to baking tins, 
buttered and sprinkled with anise seed, 
and bake in a slow oven to a light 
straw color. 

Elderberry Wine 

Pick from the stems enough elder- 
berries to make five quarts. Pour over 
them five gallons of water. Heat to 
the boiling-point, then let boil half an 
hour. Strain, and add fourteen pounds

cream. Or shape in a mould, and at 
serving time unmould and surround 
with whipped cream. The mould 
may be lined with sections of orange

Devil Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter. Beat

the yolks of four eggs, then beat in, 
gradually, one cup of sugar, and beat 
these into the butter and sugar. Add 
one cup of milk, alternately, with two 
and one-third cups of sifted flour

Recipes for Rosette Irons 

The recipe for fritter batter for use 
with rosette irons given, in connection 
with the illustration of the irons; some 
time ago in this magazine, works per- 
fectly, and we see no way of improving 
upon it. The best way to vary the 
recipe is by varying the materials used 
with the rosettes. Omit the sugar 
from the batter, and use the rosettes 
as cases for chopped chicken, oysters, 
or sweetbreads in a sauce. Rich, 
highly seasoned vegetable purees may 
also be served in the rosettes. When 
sugar is used in the batter, the cases 
may be filled with strawberry preserves, 
or with a fruit jelly of any kind. Bits 
of fresh fruit mixed with sugar make 
a good filling. Whipped cream, sweet- 
ened and flavored, may be used as a 
filling alone or in connection with pre- 
served or fresh fruit.

Lady Fingers 

Beat the whites of three eggs until 
dry. Gradually beat in one-third a 
cup of sugar, then add the yolks of 
three eggs beaten until thick, and a 
few drops of vanilla extract. Then 
cut and fold into the mixture a scant 
third a cup of flour, sifted with a few 
grains of salt. Shape on a buttered 
baking-sheet, making each cake about 
four and a half inches long and one 
inch wide. Dredge lightly with sugar, 
and bake about eight minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

Flaky Pastry 

Sift three cups of sifted pastry flour 
with half a teaspoonful of salt. With 
a knife or the tips of the fingers work 
half a cup of shortening into the flour. 
When no lumps of shortening are 
visible, add cold water, gradually, and 
mix to a paste. It will take from 
three-eighths to three-fourths a cup of 
water. Knead just enough to get the 
paste into shape. Cover and let stand 
five minutes, then pat with the rolling- 
pin, and roll out into a rectangular 
sheet. Have ready half a cup of but- 
ter, worked to a waxy consistency, in 
a bowl of cold water (the bowl, wooden 
spoon or hands, should be washed first, 
in hot and then in cold water). Pat 
the butter into a rectangular piece, 
and lay it upon the centre of one side 
of the paste. Fold the paste over the 
butter, and press the edges together, 
to enclose the butter. Fold one end 
of the paste under the butter, the 
other end over the butter, then pat 
and roll out into a long strip. Fold 
one end of the strip under and the 
other end of the strip over, thus mak-

in diameter. Brush over the top of 
each cake with beaten egg t diluted

strongest at the bottom of the oven 
to insure the ' 'puffing" of the cakes. 
When baked and cold, open at one 
side, and fill with whipped cream,

cream, one-third a cup of sugar, and 
a teaspoonful of vanilla extract will

The Doctor's Wife 

Agrees with him about Food 

A trained nurse says, ' 'In the prac- 
tice of my profession I have found so 
many points in favor of Grape-nuts 
food that I unhesitatingly recommend 
it to all my patients. 

"It is delicate and pleasing to the 
palate (an essential in food for the 
sick), and can be adapted to all ages, 
being softened with milk or cream for 
babies or the aged, when deficiency of 
teeth renders mastication impossible. 
For fever patients or those on liquid 
diet, I find Grape-nuts and albumen 
water very nourishing and refreshing." 
This recipe is my own idea, and is made 
as follows : Soak a teaspoonful of Grape- 
nuts in a glass of water for an hour. 
Strain and serve with the beaten white 
of an egg and a spoonful of fruit juice 
for flavoring. This affords a great deal 
of nourishment that even the weakest 
stomach can assimilate without any 
distress. 

* 'My husband is a physician, and he 
uses Grape-nuts himself, and orders it 
many times for his patients. 

' 'Personally, I regard a dish of Grape- 
nuts, with fresh or stewed fruit, as the 
ideal breakfast for any one, well or 
sick." Name given by Postum Com- 
pany, Battle Creek, Mich. 

In any case of stomach trouble, ner- 
vous prostration, or brain fag, a ten 
days' trial of Grape-nuts will work 
wonders toward nourishing and re- 
building, and in this way ending the 
trouble. ' 'There's a reason," and trial

Query 938.— A. W., Waukegan, 111. : "How 
can fudge be made to have it soft, yet 
firm, and not grainy? How can a nut can-, 
nelon be made, using one cup of rolled bread 
crumbs, half or a whole cup of nut-meats, 
and two eggs, with some moisture, so that, 
it shall be light, and not party and soggy? 
Also, how can turkey dressing be made light 
and not soggy?" 

Soft, Smooth, Firm Fudge 

The recipe given in the December, 
1903, magazine makes good fudge. 
Stirring sugar while it is cooking 
causes it to grain when cold. If a 
soft, smooth fudge is preferred, stir 
the ingredients while cooking only 
just enough to keep them from burn- 
ing. Then, when cooked enough, let 
the candy cool a little before begin- 
ning to beat it. See also answer to 
Query 923. 

Light Nut Cannelon 

The lightness of a cannelon, such 
as is described, depends, in large meas- 
ure, upon the quality of the bread. 
If stale bread be used, do not put it 
through a meat or food chopper, but 
grate or press it through a colander. 
Mix with the nuts, stir in about one- 
third a cup of boiling water, and then 
the eggs, beaten light. I suppose, 
in this case, the eggs are added for 
nutriment. The cannelon is sliced 
more easily when eggs are used, but 
the mixture is more dense than when 
they are omitted. If the bread be 
dried, it may be ground in the meat- 
chopper. Such bread will take up a 
large quantity of moisture. 

Light Turkey Dressing 

Use baker's bread or crackers rolled 
fine. Melt the butter in a very little 



hot water. Do not use eggs unless 
you wish to slice the dressing. Keep 
the bread light while crumbing it 
by pressing it through . a colander. 
The following proportions have been 
approved: two cups of crumbs, half 
a cup of butter, melted in one-third 
a cup of hot water, one-fourth a tea- 
spoonful, each, of salt and pepper, 
half a teaspoonful of fresh-dried sweet- 
herbs or spiced poultry seasoning. 



Lazy Coffee

Postum Coffee is not made like ordi-

five minutes' cooking to bring out the 
heavy food value of Postum. It re- 
quires some effort for those things 
which are really worth while. Making 
Postum requires a little care. 

The grocer is in a position to hear of 
those lazy ones who will not take the 
trouble to make Postum correctly. ' 'I 
am well acquainted indeed with Pos- 
tum," says a grocer of Camden, N.J., 
' 'for I meet it not only at my breakfast 
table, but I am also associated with it 
daily in my business." 

1 'Coffee drinking used to affect my 
nerves and stomach ; but, since we have 
been using Postum in our family in 
place of coffee, the bloated feeling after 
eating has disappeared, and my head 
is now clear, and stomach and nerves all 
right. We all feel better in every way, 
and find Postum just as satisfactory to 
our palates. 

' 'I have met customers who com- 
plained that Postum was not good, but 
we always found this due to the fact 
that they tried to make it as they used 
to make coffee. Of course we set them 
right by pointing out the reasons, tell- 
ing them they must boil Postum fifteen 
or twenty minutes after boiling com- 
mences, then they get fine, choice, and 
delicious Postum . ' ' Name furnished by

Savory Breakfast, Dinner, and 
Supper Dishes. By Charles Herman 
Senn. Cloth. Price 3J. 6d net. Lon- 
don : Spottiswoode & Co. 
To understand fully that this is a 
special rather than a general work 
on cookery, emphasis must be laid on 
the word savory. The volume com- 
prises chiefly side dishes; i.e., special 
recipes for kors-d'<euvres, after-dinner 
savories, salads, and sandwiches, and 
the best means of utilizing "left-overs," 
such as cold fish, cold meat and vege- 
tables, from which many tasty and 
wholesome dishes can be made, and, 
in most cases, at small cost. 

The recipes are numerous, rich in 
variety, and excellent. They bear both 
the English and the French titles. For 
cook and housekeeper the book pro- 
vides a valuable series of dainty and 
yet practical recipes for savory dishes 
suitable for all meals and all occasions. 
From the same distinguished author 
we have "Simple Cookery for the 
People," price id., it "being recipes 
for inexpensive dishes specially suit- 
able for artisan households," etc., or 
families with small incomes. 

The directions given are simple, easy, 
and distinct for preparing palatable, 
nourishing, . and economical dishes. 
The exact quantity of the different 
ingredients, the time required for cook- 
ing, and the cost of each dish have 
been carefully specified. The last 
item is a commendable feature, and 
one worthy of imitation. It suggests 
frugality, and aids in rendering the 
booklet serviceable to many a house- 



keeper. It will be noted that these 
books bear marks of their English 
origin, — a fact, however, that renders 
them no less valuable. 

The Rocky Mountain Cook Book. 

By Caroline Trask Norton. Denver, 

Col. : W. F. Robinson Company. 

The author of this practical volume 
is a graduate from the Boston School 
of Domestic Science, and formerly 
teacher of domestic science in Denver, 
Col. She gives here the benefit of 
her experience in making high-altitude 
cooking a special study. She says the 
greatest difference between cooking 
at sea level and at Denver is in cakes. 
Most sea-level recipes can be used in 
Denver by adding to them another 
egg, which gives a delicious, moist, 
rich cake. Water boils at sea level at 
2 1 2 . In Denver, where the air is 
lighter, it boils at 202 , therefore it 
does not get as hot in the latter place. 
So vegetables or anything boiled re- 
quires a little longer cooking. For in- 
stance, the famous Boston baked 
beans can be cooked equally as good 
in Denver, if they be soaked some 
eighteen hours before parboiling. 

These hints will give the clew to the 
situation of the cook in high altitudes. 
From them, also, the inference may be 
drawn that cooking anywhere is some- 
what of a scientific process. 

All the recipes in this volume have 
been tried and proved by the author. 
The book is well adapted in all respects 
to meet the long-felt wants of those in 
certain sections of the country who

Vegetarian Cook Book. By E- G. 

Fulton. Oakland. Cal. : Pacific 

Press Publishing Company 

The author has treated the subject 
from the commonly accepted definition 
of the terra "vegetarianism," which 
means to abstain from flesh food, but 
allows the use of eggs, milk and its 
products. As his raison d'etre for the 
book, the author claims that the 
amount of patent medicines, "sure 
cures," and so-called "dyspepsia cures" 
consumed by the people in the United 
States, is enormous, and is increasing 
alarmingly every year. "It must be 
apparent," he says, "to all students 
of the past century that the people of 
the present are not enjoying the same 
degree of health as our ancestors, nor 
have we any assurance that things will 
improve unless some radical change is 
made. Disease among cattle, poultry, 
and fish, has increased so alarmingly in 
the last few years that we should no 
longer depend on the animal kingdom 
for food, but should look to the grains, 
nuts, vegetables, and fruits for a better 
dietary than can be prepared from the 
flesh of animals likely to be contami- 
nated." 

This is the vegetarian's line of 
thought, and certainly it is not void 
of truth. What we should eat and 
drink is a subject of greater impor- 
tance than ever before. People are, 
doubtless, inclined to eat and drink 
to excess. Reforms, also, are plants 
of slow growth. At any rate, this ques- 
tion of diet, and all kindred subjects 
that pertain to hygienic living, cannot 
be given too much attention. 

The recipes that largely make up 
the contents of this volume are excel- 
lent. We give one specimen : — 

Roast Duck (Vegetarian Style). 
Lentil pulp, ij cups. 
Minced onion, J cup. 

Chopped parsley, 1 cup. 



Stale bread crumbs, ground fine, t cup. 
Eggs (i hard boiled), 3. 
Butter, one teaspoonful. 
Chopped walnuts, J cup. 

Take lentil pulp, one hard-boiled egg 
chopped fine, one beaten egg, minced onion, 
and chopped parsley browned in a little oil, 
one teaspoonful of butter, and salt to taste. 
Mix well, and put one-half of this mixture in 
an oiled baking-pan, then a layer of the fol- 
lowing mixtures stale bread crumbs soaked 
in hot water, chopped walnuts, a little grated 
onion, one egg, and salt and sage to taste. 
Finish with a layer of the lentil mixture. 
Bake and serve with gravy made from nut 
butter, etc. 

The book also holds a directory of 
vegetarian restaurants, cafe, and sana- 
toriums, which may be of value to many 
people.

When Grapes are Ripe 

By Mary Taylor-Ross 



AT this season of the year, when 
JUL grapes are plentiful and reason- 
± m able in price, the housekeeper 
will do well to try a few grape goodies 
by way of a change in desserts, and she 
may be quite sure that they will be 
appreciated by the family. Then, too, 
the healthfulness of this fruit above all 
others has been well established. One 
need not go to sanatoriums where the 
"grape cure" is practised, for it is pos- 
sible to try the efficacy of the treatment 
right in one's home. 

It is said that grapes may be pre- 
served fresh for winter use in the fol- 
lowing manner : Select perfect bunches 
of grapes, and see that the fruit is solid 
on the bunch. Look carefully over 
each bunch to remove possible spiders 
or spider webs, but do not wash the 
grapes. Wrap each one carefully in 
dark blue tissue paper, twisting the ends 
closely together so as to exclude the 
air, then pack the bunches away in a 
box or basket. Keep in a cool, dark, 
dry place, and cover the receptacle 
closely. It is said that in this way the 
grapes will keep perfectly good and 
fresh until as late as St. Valentine's 
Day. It was a California woman who 
discovered this method of preserving 
the fresh fruit, and who vouches for 
its efficacy. The grapes must not be 



uncovered until they are to be used, 
and then only just before serving. 

A Simple Method of Canning 

Grapes 

For this purpose select grapes that 
are under-ripe rather than fruit that 
is fully matured. Pick carefully from 
the stems, one by one, and pack closely 
without breaking the skins in a self- 
sealing can. Make a syrup of half a 
cup of sugar and one cup of water, 
using this proportion for as much syrup 
as is necessary. Pour the syrup over 
the fruit, and, if this amount does not 
fill a quart can, pour in distilled water 
till the liquid is flush with the top. 
Now adjust the cover of the jar without 
screwing it down tight, and set the cans 
in a wash boiler, having slats of wood 
laid across the bottom. Fold towels 
upon the laths or cover with straw, to 
keep the cans from touching the bot- 
tom of the boiler. Pour in water till 
it reaches within two or three inches 
the tops of the jars, then place the 
boiler over the fire and bring to boiling- 
point. Let th.e water boil one hour

tops screwed down closely. Keep jars 
in a cool, dark place, and the grapes 
canned in this way will retain their 
natural flavor, having the fresh, deli- 
cious taste of the ripe fruit. 

A Simple Grape Wine 
has been made for many years by allow- 
ing three pounds of sugar to a large 
basket of Concord grapes. Take off 
the stems, put them into a barrel, 
laying the fruit in layers and sprink- 
ling the sugar between the layers. 
Make the barrel air-tight, and set away 
for ten to twelve weeks, when it may 
be bottled for use, and, of course, the 
longer it is kept the richer in flavor it 
becomes. Use no water, and do noth- 
ing but what is advised in the recipe, 
as this same recipe has been followed 
for years by one person without a 
single failure. 

Unfermented Grape Juice 
The process of making is very simple. 
Take one quart of fully ripe Concord 
grapes. Pick from the stems, wash, 
add one quart of water, and cook 
till very soft. Then mash and press 
through a strainer covered with a 
double thickness of cheese-cloth. Allow 
one cup of white sugar to each quart 
of juice. Let this boil up once on the 
fire, after the sugar has dissolved, and 
then bottle at once, while hot, wrapping 
the bottles in towels wet in cold water, 
to keep them from breaking as they 
are filled with the hot juice.

of one lemon and two oranges, two dozen 
cloves, half a nutmeg, and a teacup of 
rose water. Over all pour one quart 
of cooking sherry, and after ten days, 
when the sherry has absorbed all these 
flavors, strain it off and bottle, corking 
tightly. Take one part of this sherry 
to three parts of grape juice, first fill- 
ing the glass one-fourth full of cracked 
ice. Rub a bit of lemon peel around 
the edge of the glass, and throw in a 
small bit of the peel to float on top, 
or a sprig of mint may be used instead. 
Of course, water may be used with the 
grape juice instead of the sherry. 
Distilled water is best, or some sort of 
charged water, which will make an 
effervescing drink. The sherry may be 
used in making all sorts of fruit punches, 
adding it in the proportion given. By 
preparing it in this way one secures a 
flavor obtainable in no other way. 

Grapes Canned without Cooking 
Gradually heat the cans by filling 
them slowly with hot water. Then set 
the cans in a basin of boiling water, 
having a folded towel on the bottom. 
Select fully ripe grapes, and cut each 
grape from the stem with scissors, using 
care net to break the skin. Lay the 
whole grapes in the cans, and then 
cover with boiling hot syrup, made 
quite rich. Seal immediately, and 
make sure that the glasses are perfect

by turning them upside down. If a 
single drop exudes, the fruit will not

Many are the delightful desserts that 
may be made from grapes and grape 
juice ; but an old-fashioned dainty, 
which is sure to prove popular with 
"himself," is a "grape cobbler." Truly 
it is a dish fit for the gods. Roll out 
a rich pie paste a trifle thicker than for 
ordinary pie, and with it line a deep 
earthen dish. Fill into this plenty of 
ripe grapes that have been stemmed 
and washed, heaping them a little in 
the middle. As the grapes are filled 
into the dish, sprinkle in all the sugar 
that will lie among them easily. Put 
on the top crust, after having made 
two crosswise slits, and, when it is in 
place, turn back the comers made by 
the slits, forming a square in the top 
crust. Bake in a quick oven. While 
it is baking, make a sauce of half a cup 
of butter and one cup of sugar, beaten 
together, and one tablespoon of boiling 
water. Flavor with nutmeg or lemon, 
and, when the pie is about baked, pour 
this sauce through the square opening 
in the crust. Put back into the oven 
for a few moments, and then serve at 
once. Use care not to over-bake the 
cobbler, or it will not be delicate, since

the crust is thick. Cream may be 
passed with it, or a sauce made just 
like that poured through the opening. 

Every housewife knows how to make 
grape jelly, but not every one knows 
that a most delicate and out-of-the- 
ordinary jelly may be made by using 
only the pulp, and rejecting the skins 
entirely. Then, too, a delicate pink 
jelly may be made from the fruit, when 
it first turns pink, long before it is ripe. 
Ordinary grape jelly is much better, if 
one-third pie plant or elderberry juice 
be used with the grape juice. In this 
case, grape sugar does not form as the 
jelly becomes old, and, altogether, such 
a jelly is much finer and more palatable, 
while the presence of the rhubarb or 
elderberry is not to be detected. 

In making grape jelly, do not press 
the fruit through the jelly bag or fruit 
strainer, as it will be coarse. Only 
use such juice as passes naturally and 
easily through the cloth. The pulp 
that remains in the strainer need not 
be wasted. Rub it through a wire 
sieve with a spoon, and put it into a 
second kettle. Cook much the same 
as before, adding nearly as much sugar, 
and the result is a fine preserve, which 
will add to the luncheon table many 
a time throughout the winter. This 
may be diluted with water, or chopped 
apples may be added. The result is a 
very good grape sauce, and nothing is 
wasted, while the jelly itself is made

pure and sparkling. Always heat the 
sugar before adding to the boiling juice, 
and the jelly will surely "jell," what- 
ever kind it may be. After cooking 
the fruit to soften (and this cooking 
should be as short as possible), pass it 
through the sieve, or strainer, and then 
measure and return to the fire. Allow 
equal quantities of sugar and fruit juice. 
Spread the sugar on a large platter, and 
place it in the oven to heat, but not 
scorch, while the juice has been put 
over the fire to boil, by actual count, 
twenty minutes. At the end of this 
time add the sugar, a little at a time, so 
as not to lower the boiling-point, then, 
after the sugar has dissolved, remove 
from the fire and pour into glasses. 
It cannot fail to jell when it is made 
in this way. Cold sugar has spoiled 
many a lot of jelly. Always select a 
bright, sunny day for jelly-making, and 
set the covered glasses in the sun for 
an hour or two. This will make them 
very bright and sparkling.

A man in Harlem dreamed that he 
found silver in his dining room. The 
next night he dreamed the same dream 
again, and told it to his wife. After 
a consultation they concluded there 
must be something in it. At one cor- 
ner of their dining-room they came 
upon a space which sounded hollow. 
The wall was of brick ; but the husband 
got a pick, and the next night they 
managed to make an opening, where 
they came, to their undoubted sur-

"Dinner-giving in Washington" 



By Waidon Fawcett 



IN official circles at the national 
capital, dinner-giving is the popu- 
lar and, one might almost say, the 
universal mode of entertaining. In 
other cities, hospitalities take a wide 
range of different forms, including card 
parties, balls, receptions, and musicales, 
without any one being conspicuously 
predominant in fashionable favor; but 
at Washington all other functions make 
but a poor comparison in number and 
importance beside the dinners, great 
and small, which are of nightly occur- 
rence from one end of the official season 
to the other. There are several reasons 
for this general preference for feasting 
as a mode of social entertainment. 

One of the principal reasons is that 
the very air at Uncle Sam's seat of gov- 
ernment is full of politics; and politics, 
alike to diplomacy and state craft, may 
be discussed to best advantage around 
a well-laden board. Then among the 
most-sought-after persons in Washing- 
ton are many diplomats who have been 
accustomed to "dining out" pretty 
continuously at the European capitals, 
and in consequence are prone to ac- 
cept those invitations which give hint 
of an appealing menu, finally, the 
President and Mrs. Roosevelt have set 
the fashion in dinner-giving. Practi- 
cally, every President who has occu- 
pied the White House has given a 



greater or less number of banquets, but 
none of his predecessors could compare 
with President Roosevelt in lavishness 
of entertaining. 

The state dinners given each winter 
by the President to the cabinet, the 
diplomatic corps, the Supreme Court, 
and other branches of officialdom, . are 
in a class by themselves. But the 
present occupant of the White House 
has not confined his dinner-giving to 
these ultra-formal affairs. During the 
Roosevelt regime there have been few 
evenings when guests have not been 
bidden to break bread with the Presi- 
dent. More than that, there are usu- 
ally guests at breakfast and luncheon 
as well. The President dislikes to sit 
down to a meal alone, and he seldom 
does. The White House cooks lead a 
strenuous existence; for often they do 
not know fifteen minutes in advance of 
the time for serving the first course 
how many guests will sit down to table. 

The State banquets at the White 
House are not served until eight o'clock, 
but on ordinary occasions the dinner 
hour is seven or seven-thirty. The 
President, energetic as he is, does not 
believe in hurrying at meal-time, and 
it is seldom that he rises from the table 
in less than forty-five minutes : whereas 
the formal banquets sometimes con- 
sume upward of two hours, even when 



i8o 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



there is no response to toasts. Upon 
ordinary occasions the meals at the 
White House are prepared by the regu- 
lar cooks, — German women or colored 
cooks are employed in that capacity,— 
and are served by regular employees of 
the Executive Mansion's domestic es- 
tablishment ; but Mrs. Roosevelt, in the 
matter of state dinners, did not follow 
the example of many of her predeces- 
sors, but inaugurated the plan of hav- 
ing these big repasts prepared and 
served by professional caterers. 

Washington hostesses have, within 
the past few years, come to rely largely 
upon these men who make a business 
of furnishing fine dinners. Many 
women of wealth who have mansions 
equipped with every culinary adjunct, 
and who could have the entire work of 
preparation performed at home just as 
well as not, now make a practice of 
calling in the professional caterer, be- 
cause it saves so much time and worry 
and bother. Your expert purveyor of 
dinners takes entire charge. He even 
brings all his own china and silver and 
other table appointments, so that mi- 



lady's treasures are not subjected to 
the wear and tear of handling by ser- 
vants of whom she has no knowledge, 
nor are her china closets made to ap- 
pear a barren waste, as would otherwise 
be the case. 

The greater proportion of the deli- 
cacies are concocted at the caterer's 
establishment, and brought ready to 
serve and piping hot, if need be, al- 
though some dishes are prepared in his 
client's kitchen, but by his own men 
and under his direction. Of course, the 
caterer attends to providing the proper 
number of waiters to serve the dinner; 
and he even orders the flowers and at- 
tends to the entire decoration of the 
dinner table and the dining apartment, 
unless the hostess has some special ideas 
of her own, which she wishes to carry 
out herself. 

The feminine leaders of social and 
official life pay a pretty penny for the 
shifting of all this worry. A state ban- 
quet at the White House, at which from 
seventy to ninety persons are present, 
costs the President from $500 to $1,000, 
notwithstanding the fact that he has

no outlay for flowers or music, both of 
which are furnished at the expense of 
Uncle Sam; and the private dinner- 
giver may expend anywhere from one 
dollar to twenty-five dollars per plate, 
dependent not only upon the menu 
itself, but upon the brands of wine 
served, the pretentiousness of the floral 
display, and other incidental considera- 
tions. 

Just as an illustration of the benefits 
of the new system, it may be pointed 
out that the fashionable caterers at the 
capital can, by offering continuous eve- 
ning employment, secure as waiters gov- 
ernment clerks, college boys, and other 
white help, which would be quite be- 
yond the reach of the individual hostess 
dependent upon the employment agen- 
cies. Then, too, they must have musi- 
cians regularly on their pay-rolls, and a 
hostess is not appalled at the last min- 
ute by a prospect of mirth without 
music. Taking all these things into 
consideration, together with the ter- 



rors of the present-day servant prob- 
lem, it is a question whether the ca- 
terer's service is not well worth the 
price for the women who can afford 
it. 

However, if the wives of the nation's 
leading officials are spared some of the 
trials of dinner-giving that befall many 
of their sisters, they have other woes 
quite as serious. One of these is the 
observance of official precedence, which 
is the great bugbear of official society 
at the capital of the nation. It may 
be a trifle difficult for the average per- 
son to understand how Uncle Sam 
could be involved in serious trouble 
with a previously friendly nation just 
because Mrs. Jones, a private citizen of 
the republic, allowed the minister from 
Switzerland to walk out to dinner 
ahead of the ambassador from Italy; 
but that is what would be very likely 
to happen. Indeed, it has happened 
on more than one occasion; and high 
officials of two powers have held grave

der of some well-meaning hostess. 
A hostess at Washington need not be

surprised if, upon inviting a prominent 
man to be her guest at dinner, she re- 
ceives a request for a list of the other 
guests who are to be present. Nor is 
it only the titled strangers within our 
gates who thus insist upon approving 
the personnel of a dinner party ere they 
will consent to come to the feast. The 
State Department kindly issues each 
month a little book which tells per- 
turbed dinner-givers who precedes 
whom and who follows whom among 
the foreign diplomats at Washington; 
but this does not solve all the troubles 
by any means, for a hostess must know 
where to seat the foreign dignitaries

officials who may be present, and vice 
versa with due regard for the rank and 
dignity of even - person concerned. 



office, who stands aghast at the pros- 
pect of being compelled to entertain 
all these high and mighty folk of easily 
ruffled dignity, turns with a sigh of 
relief to the young women who make 
a business of knowing the devious ins 
and outs of Washington society, and 
who will do all that the caterer does 
not do from sending out invitations 
to seating the guests at table. It is 
because of the numerous pitfalls in 
dinner-giving that the social secretary 
thrives in Washington as in no other 
city in the country. Some of these 
secretaries serve many mistresses. For 
instance, Miss Isabelle Hague r, who is 
socially Mrs. Roosevelt's first lieuten- 
ant, performs a similar service for Mrs. 
Thomas Nelson Page, wife of the au- 
thor, and other prominent i 



* Dinner-giving in Washington " 



■83 



Washington hostesses frequently send 
dinner invitations to prominent men 
whom they have never met, and who 
may possibly be quite unknown to 
every other guest at the table. This is 
a practice which has some vogue in all 
large cities, but it is especially true of 
the national capital. Not only do 
celebrities in Washington receive dinner 
invitations from socially ambitious 
people whom they never saw nor heard 
of, but in a surprisingly large number 
of cases they accept them. The 
younger diplomats are the especial 
prizes in this "lion -hunting" in which 
good dinners are offered as bait. There 
are under- secretaries of embassies and 
legations at the American capital — 
young men of good address and versa- 
tile conversation — who scarce pay for 
their dinner from one end of the season 
to the other. Usually, indeed, they 
have more invitations than* they can 
accept. In most instances no return is 



expected for this hospitality, but occa- 
sionally a much-feted diplomat will re- 
pay his most generous hostesses with in- 
vitations to a theatre party. There have 
been bachelor congressmen who have 
been almost as successful as the diplo- 
mats in winning dinners by their wit. 

Some of the dinner-giving in Wash- 
ington is virtually obligatory. For in- 
stance, custom has decreed that each 
member of the cabinet shall once each 
season entertain at dinner the Presi- 
dent and the members of the cabinet 
together with their wives. At certain 
of the foreign embassies there is an un- 
written law that the envoy shall enter- 
tain the members of his staff at stated 
intervals. The ranking hostess of the 
army circle and her husband entertain 
the Secretary of War and other high 
military officials at least once a year, 
and there are corresponding hospitali- 
ties in the navy "set." 

In the Congressional circle there is 



s of Reginald DeKoven

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



a great deal of entertaining; and some 
wives of senators (as, for instance, Mrs. 
Alger and Mrs. Fairbanks, both of 
whom are famous dinner-givers) follow 
the custom of occasionally inviting to 
dinner the entire Congressional delega- 
tion from the State which their hus- 
bands represent. Where the two sena- 
tors of a State are on friendly terms, as 
is not always the case, the wife of one 



sometimes entertains in honor of the 
lady who presides over the household 
of her husband's colleague. Such was 
the dinner which Senator and Mrs. 
Chauncey M. Depew gave in honor of 
Senator Piatt, of New York, and his 
bride, and which was the means of dis- 
closing a social feud, owing to the de- 
clination of several prominent women 
who had been invited to attend. 



As Yellow as Gold 



By Mary E. Knowlton 



Here's a pumpkin, fluted, golden, 
Written o'er with customs olden 

Out of bygone days. 
Cinderella's ancient glory, 
Sung in song and told in story, 

Suits its yellow blaze. 

Tables at the first Thanksgiving, 
When colonial dames were living, 

Shewed its golden cheer. 
Still it smiles a friendly greeting 
At the happy family meeting 

On the feast-day dear. 



Christmas rooms are gay with holly, 
Christmas sees the merry folly 

Of the mistletoe. 
Easter lilies, pure and stately, 
In the springtime bloom sedately, 

When soft breezes blow. 

Autumn dressed the woods in splendor; 
But their colors, rich and tender, 

All have passed away. 
Now the pumpkin, ripe and mellow, 
Keeps a tint of Autumn's yellow 

For Thanksgiving Day. 



Petty Puzzles 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



WHY is it that insistence upon 
minor rights or the betrayal 
of petty vulgarities seem 
more discordant in summer than in 
winter ? for we are conscious that our 
convictions have been strengthened or 
lessened according to the vexations or 
contentments, the failures or successes, 
which have flitted across us. Our in- 
nate sense of what is due to the beauty 
of June days or of October haze rebels 
against any marring of that beauty by 
snobbishness or vulgarity; for, though 
compelled to acknowledge that our 
dogs are snobs, we yet resent the per- 
sonal variety, and, though sharp out- 
lines of landscape and metallic brilliancy 
of sky may make a "vulgar day," as one 
friend calls it, we know that softness 
of cloud or fog is sure to follow. 

Still, how can one avoid feeling an- 
noyed or "riled" at the rampant snob- 
bishness begotten by summer hotels? 
Must one forever remind herself that 
she has no right to intrude her desire 
for comradeship upon somebody else 
who has a right to decline to know her? 
Must she contentedly acknowledge that 
she was weighed in the balance, and 
always found wanting? 
* Yet self-reliance is strengthened by 
the politely indifferent exchanges of 
summer courtesies; but, when there is 
real trouble, illness," or mishap, then 
summer is lavish in its exquisitely 
proffered aid, and sympathy grows 
beautiful in its tender shyness. Less 
censorious than Horace Walpole, we 
still can say with him that "to those 
who think life is a comedy, to those 
who feel a tragedy." 

But, in spite of our philosophy, the 
little vulgarities growing out of summer 
freedom, with their unintentioned care- 
lessness, besmirch for us the glory of 



the sunset. Consider a picnic; and at 
eventide its debris proves its degree of 
vulgarity. For the picnic which has 
butlers to care for its hampers exists 
only for the few, who know little of 
the happy-go-lucky license of a free- 
to-all picnic, where papers, egg-shells, 
and melon rinds are its marks, though 
two stray boys, one at each end of a 
discarded watermelon, eating through 
it until their lips met, gave drollery to 
a certain picnic. 

If the qualifications of a rough and 
ready picnicker are robustness and 
freedom from any kind of mental sensi- 
tiveness, jollity and helpfulness are 
the characteristics of a church or Sun- 
day-school picnic, — a far higher grade 
of social festivity. If a girl is helpful 
on such an occasion, she will soon be 
made a Sunday-school teacher, whether 
or not she knows how. If merry and 
resourceful, the children will hang 
round her, their grateful parents ask- 
ing her to supper the next day, and 
the young men will vote her secretary 
of something, giving her all their work 
to do in plans for church activities, 
even if they do not care to take her 
canoeing or to sit out with her under 
the trees. Picnics are better than 
hotels for indicating one's possibili- 
ties. 

At picnics the matter of dress in it- 
self is an eye-opener as to another's 
ambitions. Thin, low white shoes 
and openwork stockings are of doubt- 
ful propriety. Still more inadmissible 
is the wearing of one's best beflowered 
hat, innumerable chains, elaborate 
shirt-waists, and showy rings. At a 
picnic a would-be aspirant to society 
should never wear more than her one 
shirt-waist ring, in which the stone is 
stmken so deep that its setting catches 



i86 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



neither on wild rosebush nor on paper 
napkins as she gathers up the remains 
of the lunch. Any kind of long bead 
chain also is as inconsistent with picnic 
freedom as a ten-thousand-dollar pearl 
rope is with a morning toilet, even if 
worn merely to save it from being 
stolen. 

There is a certain inborn etiquette of 
dress as of service, chafe under it as we 
may. Even a sewing circle or a 
church has its rules of time and place. 
A frock coat and a soft hat (the two 
together are never correct) would be 
as bad form at a picnic as a sack coat 
at church. A finger shield at some 
sewing circles would be as much too 
professional as It would be too showy 
to flaunt a gold thimble where others 
wear celluloid. A woman who can 
graduate from any sewing circle with 
the good will of all concerned is one 
who is as lovely as she is sincere, and 
who, though plain in features and 
dress, is graceful in her demeanor. 

As for the vulgarisms of speech, the 
''hadn't ought to," the frequent "con- 
found it," and its like, the current slang 
of the day, the breezy greeting, they 
reach their height in summer to wither 
away under winter's decorum. Yet 
such lapses in good breeding are not as 
petty as gossip nor as malicious as 
slander, while the heaviness of stilted 
English, the platitudes of correct 
thought, and the distressing inanities 
about books make one almost prefer 
gossip. Spontaneousness in thought, 
speech, and act, should never lose its 
charm by misplaced valuations on 
formality or on vulgarity. 

Apart, however, from minor summer 
perplexities, there are real individual 
problems to be settled. Ought one to 
buy at a church fair things she does 
not want just for the sake of helping 
a church whose creed she may or may 
not accept ? Does it hurt art or manu- 
factures to pay a good price for poor 
"»rk? Still more, does it connive at 



dishonesty ? Ought one to go to church 
every Sunday and never have a sum- 
mer vacation in that line? And then 
is recalled that wonderful reply, as told 
by Edna Lyall, of the Newgate prisoner 
for conscience 1 sake to his noncon- 
formist fellow-prisoner, who. had ob- 
jected to the church belief of the third 
inmate of the cell they shared together, 
"I was always for Christ's open house- 
keeping since I had inner acquaintance 
with him." 

Is it right on Sunday to play golf, 
but not "bridge," or is it right to do 
neither? Though, if a woman is ner- 
vous, may she knit for the poor on 
that day ? Is it right to drive, but not 
to sail, to take a nap or to write letters, 
to sing hymns or to expect a better 
dinner than on week-days? In addi- 
tion to these Sunday questions, are the 
weekly ones of what one owes one's 
self in playtime, and of what one owes 
bell-boys and maids as fees, and of how 
far one should enter complaints when 
badly served. Shall poor cooking or 
bad material in food be meekly en- 
dured? If not, one is sure to be dis- 
liked by the hotel proprietor. 

There are still harder questions to 
settle. How far shall we tolerate 
those whose actions we are compelled 
to disapprove? We cannot all do as 
did Queen Adelaide, wife of William 
IV., who, desiring that no one whose 
reputation was not above suspicion 
should be presented at court, said to 
a lady who had come forward to kiss 
the royal hand, *"Will you be good 
enough te pass on?" 

However we may decide as to what 
we ought to do, — and we smill decide 
largely according to our temperaments, 
— we should at least go back to our 
winter work refreshed in mind and 
body by the summer. We must not 
succumb to the "disease of work," nor 
be "debauched by affairs and know 
no peace except in the midst of full 
activity," as was the case with Dr.

MRS. HUMPHREY put down 
her book when she had read 
the last page, and, resting her 
chin in the palm of her hand, gazed 
steadily into the glowing coals of the 
open grate fire. Her husband, on the 
other side of the small table, put his 
paper down and smiled across at her. 
Feeling his gaze, she turned and met 
his eyes gravely. 

"What are your deductions ?" he 
asked, picking up the book she had 
been reading. 

"I think I'll try it," she said mus- 
ingly. Her husband looked puzzled as 
he asked "Try what, dear?'* 

"I am going to apply Mr. Sheldon's 
theory, on the servant-girl question, 
to the new girl who comes in the morn- 
ing," Mrs. Humphrey said with con- 
viction. 

Mr. Humphrey threw his head back 
and laughed heartily; and then, meet- 
ing her rather offended glance, he 
sobered down, though there was still 
a suspicious twinkle in his eye as he 
said: "Helen, you are the mistress of 
this house, and can do all the experi- 
menting you wish. Far bfe it from me 
to interfere." 

"And will you promise not to ridi- 
cule nje?" was the rather anxious 
query. 

"I promise," he responded promptly, 
"and I won't even say 'I told you 
so' if the experiment fails; but I say, 



Helen, will you have her sit at the 
table with us?" 

"Oh, no!" she interposed hastily. 
"I shouldn't like that at all; that is, 
it is not advocated in Mr. Sheldon's 
book." 

"All right. I just wanted to know. 
I thought I'd have to brush up my 
German a little, so I could converse 
at the table. Your new treasure is 
German,. isn't she?" 

"She is a German American," was 
the reply. 

The new girl presented herself the 
next day, and was installed in the ser- 
vant's room by Mrs. Humphrey, who 
apologized for the size of it, and ex- 
plained that they had no other room 
to spare just then. 

The first day was a discouraging one 
to Mrs. Humphrey ; for the girl appeared 
stolid, indifferent, and stupid. That 
evening, when they sat down to a 
miserably cooked dinner, Mr. Hum- 
phrey glanced inquiringly at his wife, 
and remarked, "She's not long on 
cooking, is she?" 

Mrs. Humphrey smiled a tired smile 
as she replied: "It isn't a very inviting 
meal. I let her get it by herself, just 
to see what she could do. But, maybe, 
she'll learn. At any rate she's clean," 
she added hopefully. 

Her husband looked thoughtful as 
he turned over a slice of roast beef 
which was pale enough to invite the 



i88

suspicion that it had been boiled, and 
then he said, "I was under the impres- 
sion that you advertised for a thor- 
oughly competent girl." 

4 'So I did," she replied. 

"Well," he said hesitatingly, slowly 
sipping some weak coffee, "is she what 
you would call competent?" 

"No," she admitted frankly, "and 
I'm afraid she won't do; but I will 
give her a fair trial." 

"And will you invite her to sit with 
us this evening?" 

"No'" she said slowly, "because I 
don't believe I am going to keep her. 
Anyway," she added, "I didn't mean 
that I was literally going to treat her 
exactly like the Wards treated Bar- 
bara, in 'Born to Serve.' " 

"Oh!" was the simple reply, but in 
such a tone that for a moment she was 
provoked ; and then her anger vanished, 
and she joined him in a laugh. 

At the end of a week she announced 
to her husband that the girl was hope- 
less; and, after discharging her, she 
again took up the task of examining 
applicants for the place. 

Within a period of a month she had 
tried, and found wanting, three girls, — 
one a negress, who was kind, but 
greasy; an American, who could not 
boil potatoes dnd refused to wash 
dishes on Sunday. As this was her 
one accomplishment, and Mrs. Hum- 
phrey paid the highest wages, she, too, 
was discharged. A third was also an 
American, with shifty eyes, who, when 
she left under cover of the darkness, after 
two days, took with her a few of Mrs. 
Humphrey's minor possessions. 

The matter had almost assumed the 
proportions of a tragedy; and the re- 
lations between husband and wife were 
becoming strained, owing to the con- 
stant change from poorly cooked meals 
to worse and worse. 

One evening when Mr. Humphrey 
opened the front door, with the ex- 
pectancy of being met by a tired, dis- 



couraged wife and an unpalatable 
meal, he was surprised, on entering the 
hall, to have his wife literally throw 
herself into his arms, as she exclaimed 
gladly, "Oh, Will, she's come, she's 
come!" # 

"Who's come?" was his puzzled 
question as he scanned her face anx- 
iously, wondering if her hired girl 
troubles had affected her brain, 

"Sh!" came the sibilant whisper, 
"she'll hear you. She's in the dining- 
room now, dishing up dinner." 

"Oh," he said in a relieved tone, 
"you must mean the new girl. When 
did she come?" 

"This afternoon.* And I know she's 
a perfect treasure, she's so pretty and 
sweet." 

"Can she cook?" asked her hus- 
band. 

"I think so. I let her get the dinner 
all by herself. Oh, I know," she in- 
terrupted herself to say reproachfully 
as she detected a slight smile on his 
face, "that you think it wouldn't have 
helped matters much if I had assisted 
her in the cooking." 

"My dear," he solemnly assured her, 
"I think you make the best salad I 
ever tasted." 

She had to laugh, in spite of her 
pique, and banteringly said, as she 
locked her arm in his, "Well, you 
didn't marry to have a cook, anyway, 
did you?" 

"Heaven forbid!" he ejaculated. 
"I would have sought in an employ- 
ment agency, not in a parlor, had I 
wanted merely a cook ; and, " he added, 
"had I married you, thinking I was 
marrying a cook, how badly I would 
have been fooled!" 

Just at that moment a trim little 
black-gowned figure, with white cap 
and apron, appeared at the door, and 
announced that dinner was served. It 
was a most palatable and well-served 
meal to which they sat down, and the 
husband and wife ate with appetites

betokening a scarcity of such meals of 
late, exchanging few words, but many 
looks of satisfaction. 

After a daintily cooked breakfast 
the next morning, Mr. Humphrey asked 
his wife what nationality their new 
treasure was, and, on being told that 
she was a Swede, exclaimed with con- 
viction, "Well, I guess Swedes are the 
only kind of girls to have." 

The first few weeks were full of con- 
tentment for Mrs. Humphrey, who, 
unwisely, sang the praises of her new 
girl throughout the town. At the end 
of the first month, Hilma, the girl, an- 
nounced to Mrs. Humphrey that she had 
been offered fifty cents a week more by 
another woman than she was then re- 
ceiving. 

Mrs. Humphrey promptly met the 
raise, which was approved by her hus- 
band, when she told him about it. 

During the next month Mrs. Hum- 
phrey thought she detected a falling 
off in the work, but kept her fears to 
herself, since Mr. Humphrey was so 
evidently happy; for Hilma abated 
nothing in the delightfully cooked 
meals and quick service. 

Mrs. Humphrey's friends were all 
openly envious of her good luck in 
obtaining such a treasure ; and the slight 
feeling of resentment she felt for Hilma, 
when she had to dust the furniture after 
her, gave way to pride when she wit- 
nessed the truly artistic way in which 
she waited on the table, answered the 
door-bell, and did all the ornamental 
things so difficult to teach a girl. She 
did not need to tell her to use the back- 
stairs, always to don a white apron 
when she answered a ring at the door- 
bell or came into the dining-room. 
She had been trained to the work of 
waitress, so no lessons were ncessary 
regarding that line of work. 

But, gradually, the scales fell from 
Mrs. Humphrey's eyes. Hilma was 
not neat, except in her 'personal ap- 
pearance and her cooking. On the 



surface, things looked pretty well; but, 
when Mrs. Humphrey fell to examining 
into the corners and the pantry drawers 
and shelves, she found a shocking con- 
dition of things. 

Hilma being so desirable in some re- 
spects, she did not want to risk offend- 
ing her, so gave the matter deep thought 
before deciding what course to pursue. 
While she was still debating about it, 
Hilma demurely told her one day that 
another friend of Mrs. Humphrey's had 
offerdd her the same wages, and had 
said she would also hire the ironing 
done. 

Mrs. Humphrey was troubled, and 
said, "Let me talk this over with Mr. 
Humphrey this evening, Hilma, be- 
fore we decide anything." 

Hilma smiled pleasantly and as- 
sented, and the dinner that evening 
went a* little ahead of their ordinary 
meals. 

When they were back in the library 
and Mr. Humphrey had lighted his 
cigar and was in a beneficent mood, 
Mrs. Humphrey told him what Hilma 
had said, and asked what she should 
do. 

"Hire the ironing done," he very 
promptly decided. 

"But can we afford it?" his wife 
feebly protested. "We are now paying 
more for our work than any of our 
friends pay, and are the least able to 
do it. I know," she added plaintively, 
"that the other women say, when dis- 
cussing it, 'How can they afford it?'" 

"I don't give a hang what the other 
women say," was Mr. Humphrey's 
vigorous rejoinder. "Why stand on 
half a dollar a week when you have so 
perfect a girl as Hilma?" 

"Well, not perfect, exactly," was 
her hesitating answer. 

He opened his eyes wide. "Not 
perfect! Why, did you ever taste 
such biscuit, such coffee, and such 
fine broiled steak as Hilma cooks, to 
say nothing of the way she roasts a 



190

duck, without losing a drop of juice? 
Well, you must be hard to please" — 

' * Oh, don't, ' ' she pleaded ! ' ' From a 
man's point of view, she is perfect. 
She excels in all the fine arts, but she's 
a little lacking. in the substantial qual- 
ities." 

"I can't se^ it," he stubbornly in- 
sisted. 

"No, of course you can't see it," 
was the somewhat spirited reply, "be- 
cause I go around and do the dusting 
after she gets through; and you can't 
see how it looks down under the sink 
in the kitchen." 

As her husband picked up a paper 
and did not reply, she sat in silence 
a little while; and then, not given to 
sulking, she said impulsively: "Per- 
haps the work has been too hard for 
Hilma. I have been so proud of her 
accomplishments that I have had lots 
of company ; and the ironings, too, have 
been large, and I'm afraid I've rather 
lost sight of Mr. Sheldon's ideas. I'll 
begin over again to-morrow." 

In the morning she had a long and 
what she considered a heart-to-heart 
talk with Hilma, in which she very 
kindly, but firmly, stated what she 
would expect in the way of cleanliness 
in return for hiring the ironing. 

Within three months, six more of her 
intimate friends had raised her in the 
game, with Hilma as the stakes; and, 
backed by her husband, she had met 
the raise, and called them. 

In the mean time, concession after 
concession was granted her expensive 
jewel, always at the instigation of her 
husband. 

One morning under the beneficent in- 
fluence.of some particularly fine waffles, 
Mr. Humphrey said complacently: "We 
are fixed for life now, aren't we? I 
mean," answering his wife's inquiring 
look, "on the servant-girl proposition. 
Hilma just fills the bill, doesn't she?" 

"Yes," assented his wife, absent- 
mindedly, as she surreptitiously wiped 



the corner of her coffee-cup with her 
napkin. 

"I'll get her a pass, and you give 
her a vacation of two weeks. It will 
brace her up for the summd," he sug- 
gested. 

Hilma received the pass and the va- 
cation with rapture, and assured Mrs. 
Humphrey of her gratitude. But, 
when she returned "after her two 
weeks' outing, she efftered into her 
work with little of her former spirit. 

Mr. Humphrey was obliged to be 
away from home nearly all of that 
summer; and, not having a man to 
cook for, Hilma grew careless even 
about her meals, — the one thing she 
had kept up well before. 

Mrs. Humphrey, realizing that it 
was hard to work during the heated 
spell, reduced the work to a minimum. 
She had light breakfasts, and had, in- 
stead of evening dinner, a cold sup- 
per. 

She gave Hilma street-car change, to 
take rides on the open cars in the even- 
ings to cool off. 

In spite of the kind treatment she 
received, Hilma became morose and 
vindictive; and her manner indicated 
that she blamed Mrs. Humphrey for 
the heat, and thought she had ordered 
it especially to torment her. 

One day, during an especially sulky 
spell, she packed her trunk and left 
without a moment's notice. 

When Mr. Humphrey returned, and 
was obliged to go back to the uncer- 
tainty of his wife's cooking, mingled 
with the still more uncertain quality 
of the occasional hired girl, he mourned 
openly for Hilma, though, like his 
wife, he felt a contempt for her for her 
ingratitude. 

"You won't try the Sheldonesque 
way of treating another girl, 1 hope," 
he said one evening. 

"I don't blame the theory," she 
said thoughtfully, "but I will have to 
get a girl to fit the theory. I don't

know where I'll find her, but I'll keep 
on trying," 

She had the usual luck in the next 
month or two, trying lazy, incom- 
petent, untidy girls who expected big 
wages and the best treatment, giving 
in return indifferent service and scant 
courtesy. 

She was almost discouraged, when 
one day a very attractive young woman 
appeared, saying she had called in 
answer to the advertisement. She 
wore a neat tailor-made suit, had on 
nose glasses, and was very evidently 
a lady. 

When she announced her errand, 
Mrs. Humphrey was astonished, and 
could not refrain from so expressing 
herself. The girl laughed frankly, ex- 
posing a set of firm white teeth, as 
she answered: "Well, I confess that 
I never have worked in any one's 
kitchen; but I have to do something 
for a living, and, having been trained 
to all kinds of housework in my own 
home, I decided to get a situation in 
a kitchen. I believe that I am not 
degrading myself, but elevating the 
position." 

"Come in," said Mrs. Humphrey, 
"and let us, at least, discuss the social 
problem." 

They talked for an hour on the ser- 
vant-girl question. They discussed 
Mr. Sheldon's book, and the girl ad- 
mitted that it was that which had in- 
fluenced her to make the experiment. 

At the end of the hour, Mrs. Hum- 
phrey said frankly: "My friends all 
say that the reason I have so much 
trouble with girls is that I am too good 
to them, I don't know how to treat 
them as they like to be treated. I 
know women who talk to their ser- 
vants as if they were not human beings, 
who pay less than I do, and put more 
work on them; yet they will have no 
difficulty in getting and keeping com- 
petent help. I have been looking for 
some one who could stand decent treat- 



ment. I believe it requires just such 
a girl as you. So, if you wish to try 
it, I am willing to help you in your ex- 
periment." 

When Mr. Humphrey came home and 
she told him about it, he looked dubi- 
ous. 

"Of course, she will want to enter- 
tain her callers in the parlor; and, 
being a college-bred young woman, 
she will find flaws in my English. But 
can she cook? That's the main ques- 
tion." 

"The main question is, Is she neat?" 

said his wife, with some asperity, as 

she thought of the dirty cake-pans 

stuck away in the pantry after Hilma 

.left. 

"Well, we won't quarrel about it," 
he said soothingly, "and we'll hope 
for the best." 

Miss Wilson, as they felt impelled 
to call her, proved to be a good plain 
cook; and, while they did not fare so 
highly as under Hilma* s regime, it was 
a relief after the girls they had had 
between the two. 

She did not offer to sit with them 
at the table, but in the evenings she 
brought her fancy work or her book 
into the sitting-room. 

Mr. Humphrey inwardly chafed at 
her presence, and did not seem to 
enjoy her flights of philosophy, which 
she occasionally put down her book 
to indulge in. 

After a few such evenings he put on 
his hat and went to the club, — some- 
thing his wife resented, and conse- 
sequently reproached him with. Ex- 
cept for being deprived of her hus- 
band's presence in the evening, Mrs. 
Humphrey enjoyed the novel experi- 
ence of having for a servant her equal 
in point of birth, education, and in- 
telligence. 

She cheerfully hired the scrubbing 
done, as well as the washing and iron- 
ing, because Miss Wilson was not strong 
enough to do it.

For a week the plan worked very well. 
But Mrs. Humphrey, who had never 
relied much upon others besides her 
husband for company, and who had 
never lived in the house with other 
women, began to find it irksome to 
keep up a flow of conversation all day 
and all evening. Being quick about 
her work, Miss Wilson had plenty of 
leisure for chatting; and it was her 
pleasure to discuss all the current 
events, and express her opinions on 
politics or religion, on domestic econ- 
omy, and on books. 

Being the first one up in the house, 
she read the morning paper when it 
first came; and after breakfast, before 
Mrs. Humphrey had had a chance to 
read it, she would tell her about it, 
and repeat everything that was in it. 

By that time the zest for reading 
had departed, so that Mrs. Humphrey 
had all of her news second hand. 

Before a month was up, her polite- 
ness was strained, and her nerves were 
in such a condition that she longed to 
throw something at Miss Wilson's head 
whenever she appeared. 

But hardest of all to bear was the 
breaking up of their pleasant even- 
ings, when she and her husband had 
read or talked or been silent, as they 
desired. He stayed at home most of 
the time after the first week, because 
he found that his absence pained her; 
but he would subside behind a paper 
and never speak, while Miss Wilson, 
like the brook, went on forever. 

She seemed perfectly satisfied with 
the experiment, and complacently ex- 
pressed herself so to Mrs. Humphrey. 

One day after a month had passed, 
Mr. Humphrey came home, and found 
his wife in bed with a nervous head- 
ache. 

"Lock the door," she whispered, 



when he entered the room, "or she 
will be in here again. She's been sit- 
ting on the foot of the bed all the after- 
noon, congratulating herself and me 
on the fact that she saw my advertise- 
ment and answered it. Oh, dear,"— 
and she went off into a fit of hysteri- 
cal laughter, — "she congratulated me, 
Will!" 

He looked sober as he asked, "Why 
don't you discharge her?" 

"I "can't," she protested, "I just 
can't. I could only tell her that she 
bored me. I haven't a ghost of an 
excuse but that; and I can't tell her 
that, can I? You can discharge her," 
she added, as an after-thought. 

"No, thank you," was his startled 
reply. 

"Well, can't you hit on some plan?" 
she asked pathetically. 

He studied a moment, and then ex- 
claimed: "I have it. We'll break up 
housekeeping and go to boarding!" 

Her face brightened, and then fell 
as she said: "You dear old thing! But 
the meals? You never could stand 
the meals, Will, you're such an epi- 
cure!" 

"Never mind the meals," was his 
gay rejoinder. "After some that have 
been dished up to me, plain boarding- 
house grub won't seem so bad. Oh, 
no, nothing personal, my dear," as she 
threatened to arise in her wrath. ' * Any- 
way, it solves the servant-girl problem; 
and it's the only solution for us I can 
think of." 

A week later, when they parted with 
Miss Wilson, she said: "I'm so sorry 
you felt obliged to break up housekeep- 
ing just as everything was going so 
nicely; but I'll come to see you occa- 
sionally, and, whenever you go to 
housekeeping again, I'll come back to 
you."

Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 

« 

By Mary D. Chambers 



IN resuming the lessons begun three 
years ago in this magazine, a word 
of explanation as to the method 
and details of the plan pursued may 
be helpful. The course is designed for 
classes which have had no previous 
work in the study of food or its prep- 
aration. It has been given, with slight 
modifications, to students both in the 
senior Academy and in the college 
Freshman and Sophomore classes of 
the James Millikin University, the chief 
difference being in the demands which 
were made, in the Review Questions, 
for the correlation of tributary subjects. 
The. lessons are planned to stimulate 
careful observation and correct infer- 
ence in the performance of the work 
in cooking. Therefore, the properties 
of foods and their reaction to the chief 
agents used in their prepkration — 
namely, water, heat, acids, and salts — 
are studied in making wholesome and 
palatable dishes in common use. 
Sometimes, to "clinch" the knowledge 
gained or to clarify an obscure infer- 
ence, a corroborative experiment is 
performed; and, immediately following 
the practical study of each foodstuff, a 
number of library references are given, 
chiefly for the purpose of helping the 
student to judge of the correctness of 
her inferences, but in some degree to 
amplify the knowledge gained from 
experiment. 

While my thanks are due to former 
•teachers for inspiration which is a 
daily help, my apologies are also due 
for the pedagogical errors in the pres- 
ent plan of work. We, instructors in 
a comparatively new subject, have 
reason to be thankful if our work 
should prove helpful or suggestive, in 



even the slightest degree, to others, 
while we earnestly hope that its faults 
may be so clearly visible to all who 
study it as to preclude any danger of 
imitation. Criticism or suggestion ad- 
dressed to the writer will be very wel- 
come. The present lessons stand by 
no means as an example, but merely 
as a record of what has been done in 
the effort to use efficiently one phase 
of Domestic Science as a factor in edu- 
cation. 

Note. — The sequence of work in the suc- 
ceeding lessons is frequently varied, and the 
time required for each usually occupies two 
double periods for the kitchen or laboratory 
work and one single period for recitation.

Lesson I. Eggs 

Tests for Freshness of Eggs 

i. Hold a fresh and a stale egg be- 
tween the hands or in an aperture 
made in stiff cardboard so that the 
light from a candle shines through the 
egg. If the candle-rays are concen- 
trated on the egg by a funnel-shaped 
piece of card, tin, or sheet-iron, the 
effect will be easier of observation. 

Which egg is the more transparent 
at the centre? Which at the ends? 
Which may be inferred fresher ? Why ? 

2. Place' perfectly fresh eggs (under 
twenty-four hours old), ordinarily fresh, 
(good store eggs), rather stale, and very 
stale eggs in a glass battery jar or other 
large glass vessel containing a satu- 
rated salt solution. (Each class of 
eggs should be distinctively marked.) 
Which class sinks in this solution?

Remove all the eggs to a second 
glass containing a 10 per cent, salt so- 
lution. Which sink in this solution? 

Remove to third glass containing 
pure water. Which sink in pure water ? 
Account for the differences. 

Suggestion for home work. Procure 
two new-laid eggs. Rub on the shell 
of one a little grease or melted paraffin. 
Test both eggs daily in a 10 per cent, 
salt solution until they float. 

Weight, Composition, and Cost of Eggs 

Eggs weighed. Number in one pound 
ascertained. Composition given. (At- 
water's Tables.) Cost discussed at 
minimum and maximum market prices.

ous methods of manipulation. 

Soft and Hard Cooked Eggs 

Select five eggs of equal size. 

Place No. i in one pint of boiling 
water in saucepan. Remove from fire, 
cover, and let stand twenty to thirty 
minutes. 

Place No. 2 in quart bowl, pour over 
it one pint of boiling water, cover bowl, 
and let stand eight to ten minutes. 

Place No. 3 in one pint of cold water, 
and let it come to a boil. 

Place No. 4 in one pint of boiling 
water, and let it boil rapidly three min- 
utes. 

Place No. 5 in one pint of boiling 
water, and let it boil rapidly twenty 
minutes. 

Break open eggs and compare. In 
which is the white the hardcSr ? in which 
the yolk? Which is the more evenly 
cooked? In which case is the yolk 
discolored ? 

Notb. — This experiment can be apportioned 
to five students, and so arranged that the eggs 
shall be ready for comparison at the same 
time. They can afterwards be seasoned, 
mixed with a tomato or a cream sauce, and 
eaten on toast. The teacher, if possible, 



should demonstrate the result of keeping an 
egg for six or seven hours in water at 150 F. 

Egg Lemonade 

Ingredients. — One egg, two table- 
spoon uls lemon juice, two tablespoon- 
fuls sugar, one cup milk or water. Fine 
chopped ice in glass. 

Method. — Boat egg, add lemon juice, 
and stir lightly at first, then beat hard. 
Add sugar, and beat again. Add milk 
or water, stir together, and pour into 
glass. 

Foamy Omelet 

Ingredients. — Eggs, milk or water, 
seasoning, butter or oil to grease pan. 

Proportion. — one tablespoonful liquid 
to one egg, one teaspoonful butter, 
seasoning to taste. 

Method. — Beat yolk until thick, add 
water or milk and pepper, and mix well. 
Beat white stiff, add salt while beating. 
Place pan over fire, and melt butter. 
Cut white into yolk. Pour into pan, 
and cook until set. Fold, and turn 
out on platter. 

Variations on Omelet. — Savory ad- 
ditions: mushrooms, oysters, chopped 
meat, fish, or fowl, cheese, herbs, etc. 
Sweet additions: jelly,' fresh or pre- 
served fruits, sugar, honey, nuts, etc. 
The various additions can be mixed 
with beaten yolk, cut into beaten white, 
or spread on omelet before folding. 

Custards and Meringub 

Soft Custard 

Ingredients. — Essentials: eggs, milk, 
water, sugar, salt. Non-essentials: 
any liquid flavoring. Dry coffee, cin- 
namon, cloves, caramel, etc. 

Proportions. — Four to six eggs to on* 
quart of milk, ordinarily. Six to eight 
yolks to one quart of milk, one-half to 
three-quarters cup of sugar, water, two 
tablespoonfuls to each egg. 

Method. — Beat eggs, sugar, and 
water together. Add milk, and mix

well. Cook at low temperature, stir- 
ring constantly, until mixture "creams." 
the spoon. 

Individual students make custards 
on the basis of one-half cup of liquid, 
alternate couples using hot and cold 
milk, hot and cold water, substituting, 
in the latter case, water for milk. Re- 
sults compared as to flavor, texture, 
consistency. 

Notes. — i. If soft custard curdles, it 
can be "brought back" by pouring at 
once into bowl, and beating hard with 
Dover beater. 

2. Liquid extracts can be added to 
soft custard after cooking. Dry flavors 
first cooked in milk, then strained off. 

3. For variety, custard can be poured 
over sliced oranges in glass or mixed 
with crushed and sifted macaroons. 

Baked Custard 

Ingredients, proportion, and method 
of mixing same as for soft custard. 

Cook by means of oven poaching. 

To Poach in Oven. — Set baking-dish 
in pan of hot water in oven, water to 
reach as high as level of mixture in 
dish. For a very delicate custard, 
water should not be allowed to boil. 

Test when cooked: a knife thrust 
into the centre comes out clean. 

Basis for class work, one-half cup 
of milk. Students required to make 
custards in three different ways; 
namely, with yolk alone, with white 
alone, and with whole egg. Results 
compared. 

Meringue 

Ingredients. — White of egg, powdered 
sugar, flavoring, salt. 

Proportion. — Two tablespoonfuls 
sugar to the white of one egg. 

Method. — Beat white stiff, adding 
salt. Add sugar gradually, beating 
well in. Add flavoring, and beat until 
smooth. 

Meringue can be piled on top of 
either custard when cooked. For baked 



custard replace in oven, door open, for 
a few minutes and allow to brown 
slightly. 

Poached eggs, scrambled eggs, dev- 
iled eggs, and souffles also make good 
illustrative material or can be re- 
quired from students as original ex- 
ercises. , 

Corroborative Experiments 

i. White of egg treated on watch 
glass with acetic or hydrochloric acid. 
Yolk similarly treated. 

2. White and yolk, small portions 
of each shaken up in test tube with 
ether. Filtrate poured on absorbent 
paper. 

3. White of egg in test tube to depth 
of one inch or more. Insert ther- 
mometer, hold test tube in saucepan 
of water over fire, and note tempera- 
ture of egg at following points : — 

(1) At first cloudy appearance. 

(2) When tender jelly is formed. (3) 
When mass is hard and tough. 

4. Yolk treated in same manner, and 
tested at points 2 and 3. 

5. Two test tubes, A and B, half 
filled with pure water. To A add a 
small portion of white of egg, to B a 
small portion of yolk. Shake well. 
Filter each into clean test tubes. Heat 
filtrate. 

6. White and yolk shaken, as in 
foregoing, in 10 per cent, salt solutions 
and in saturated salt solutions. Fil- 
trate poured into beakers of pure 
water. Heat applied.

A Hint 

By Kate Matson Post 

There are bridges of wood and bridges of steel 

And bridges of iron and stone; 
There are narrow planks o'er mountain streams 
L That each one has to cross alone. 



But the strongest of bridges often seem frail 

If we look beneath as we cross 
At the waters swiftly rushing on 

To the sea where the whitecaps toss. 

But the bridge that is really dangerous 

Far beyond all others I know, 
Which is much too frail to span the stream 

Where the current runs swift below, 



Is the bridge that we never have come to yet 
And perchance we may never reach. 

'Tis built of the things we dread to do, 
That may come to the lot of each. 

But I'll give you a hint 'twould be wise to take 
As you're treading life's path each day: 

Just cross each bridge, be it frail or strong, 
As you come to it on your way; 



And the far-away bridge that looked hard to cross 
When in mist-enwrapped distance seen 

May prove, when reached, but a vine-clad arch, 
O'er-spanning some quiet ravine. 



A Book Reception 

By Anna B. A. Brown 



WHEN a library is to be 
added to school or Sunday- 
school in a small village or 
town, or a free reading-room, opened 
by some progressive club, or a travel- 
ing library, fitted out to be sent out into 
the rural districts, the object is much 
more easily accomplished when a social 
event is made of collecting the books. 

A plan that worked admirably in 
a Southern town not long since made 
of the work one of the social events of 
the season, and because of the enthusi- 
asm awakened sent out one of the best 
selected traveling libraries that ever 
went from that section. 

The county paper liberally adver- 
tised the event; and posters, repre- 
senting a man in English costume of 
the fifteenth century, with his arms 
filled with books, walking rapidly across 
the bill-boards, set forth the object of 
the entertainment and the needs of 
the traveling library committee. An 
entertainment of the best local talent 
was given, and no admission was 
charged, each guest being required 
to bring some good book, either new 
or old, — if in good condition, — as his 
donation toward the library. A dele- 
gation of women received these at the 
door, immediately cataloguing each, 
with the donor's name following. Each 
guest was given a card with a series 
of consecutive numbers and spaces 
left opposite for names in the guessing- 
contest, which was to follow the pro- 
gramme. 

For the contest an especial room had 
been fitted up, a number of objects 
representing the titles of books being 
placed in conspicuous places on long 
tables, each carefully numbered. Not 
even the names of authors were given, 
and the guessers were put on their 



mettle to place definitely the titles. A 
prize was offered for the most correct 
list, and a booby of "Mother Goose 
Melodies" for the least correct list. 
Some of the books represented were : 
i. "The Ring and the Book." 
Browning. A book to which a plain 
ring was conspicuously tied. 

2. "Under Two Flags." Ouida. A 
photograph of Ouida under two small 
crossed flags. 

3. "Red Rock." Thomas N. Page. 
A piece of bright red stone. 

4. "Oliver Twist." Dickens. Apiece 
of paper twisted into a- long roll (all of 
a twist). 

5. "Five O'Clock Tea." William 
Dean Howells. A little five-o'clock 
tea-table with all its appointments. 

6. "The Red Cockade." Weyman. 
A cockade made of bright red ribbon. 

7. "On the Face of the Waters." 
Steele. A picture representing a ship 
at sea. 

8. "The Sign of the Four." Conan 
Doyle. The Roman numeral IV. 

9. "The Mill on the Floss." Eliot. 
A small coffee-mill standing on a pile 
of many-colored embroidery silks. 

10. "Adam Bede." Eliot. A card 
on which were written an A and a 
dash followed by a bead carefully 
sewed on (A — bead). 

11. "The Wide, Wide World. ' ' Miss 
Weatherell. A globe or map of all the 
world. 

12. "Middlemarch." Eliot. A leaf 
from a calendar showing the month of 
March, with the figure 16 done in red. 

13. "One Summer. ' ' Blanche Willis 
Howard. The leaves from a calendar 
for the months June, July, and August. 

14. "Redgauntlet." Scott. A red 
riding-glove.

Editorials 

So long as we love, we serve. So 
long as we are loved by others, I would 
almost say we are indispensable; and 
no man is useless while he has a friend. 
Robert Louts Stevenson. 



The man who finds what sort of work 
he is fitted for, and who, by dint of 
will, good luck, and a combination of 
various causes, manages to be employed 
upon the work he is fitted for, and, when 
he is so employed upon it, does it con- 
scientiously and with pleasure because 
he can do it well, that man is an artist. 
William Morris, 



JOY IN WORK 

OU can only educate people 
along the line of their natural 
tendencies." Many a genius 
has tried, in vain, other pursuits than 
that which nature had prescribed for 
him. Emerson was a poor school- 
master and a dull preacher before he 
found his life-work. Hawthorne was 
an indifferent custom-house officer. 
The poet Burns is not known to fame 
as collector of excise. Men and wQmen 
do best what they like to do, are most 
fond of doing, in other words, what 
they have a predilection for. Herein 
lies the secret of all* educational and 
industrial training. 

The only way to make housekeeping 
successful is to make it pleasant. En- 
vironment has much to do with this. 
Cheerful, wholesome, attractive sur- 
roundings contribute to contentment 
' and joyful effort. Work naturally par- 
takes of the nature and character of 
the workshop. 

Satisfaction in work well done is 
another incentive to successful achieve- 
ment. Every one, and especially every 
woman, likes to be praised. The feel- 
ing that her work is done a little better 
than her neighbors, perhaps, is a source 
of gratification. And, besides, the con- 
sciousness of having attained a certain 
degree of excellence leads to greater 
effort and finer results. There is a 
world of meaning in that wonderful 
saying, ''Well done, good and faithful 
servant!" 

Above all, high ideals are indispen- 
sable to good work in any line of ac- 
tivity. But it may be said, How can 
one have high ifleals in the midst of 
household drudgery? Home life and 
the health of the world are largely de- 
pendent upon woman's efforts. Here, 
it seems to us, may be found incentives 
to the loftiest aims. Simplicity, ex- 
pression, cheerfulness, are three words, 
fraught with) 'meaning, which may be

regarded a$ the keynotes of character- 
building in the present day. 

TOLERATION AND PEACE 

NOTWITHSTANDING fierce 
war is raging abroad, and a 
Presidential campaign is in 
progress at home, an unusual state of 
peace and quiet seems to exist through- 
out our land. May it long continue! 
Once people were zealous in . dispute 
and quick to resort to violence, simply 
because of differences of opinions and 
beliefs. Now toleration of others' views 
on questions social, political, and re- 
ligious, is becoming quite apparent 
among large masses of mankind. 

We can scarcely conceive how one 
man or a society of men can hope to 
prescribe the channel for another's 
thoughts. Freedom of thought and 
freedom of speech are sure signs of 
advancement in intelligence and civil- 
ization. To-day, it is said, men are 
inclined to think for themselves, draw 
their own conclusions, and act accord- 
ingly. We choose leaders to execute 
our decrees. We are not chosen by 
them to fulfil selfish motives, for we 
are no longer subject to the will or 
caprice of priest or king. 

Nothing is more certain, though the 
remark be trite, than that intelligent 
people everywhere are bitterly opposed 
to needless, selfish war. The war spirit 
has become a relic of the past. Almost 
universally war is considered an un- 
mitigated evil, and entirely unnecessary. 
Peace, wide-spread and lasting, alone is 
conducive to abiding prosperity and 
happiness. 

It is now self-evident that the earth 
and the fulness thereof was not given 
to a single people, but to all the people 
who dwell upon the face thereof; 
also that the welfare of each indi- 
vidual family of the race is, in a meas- 
ure, dependent upon the welfare of all. 
The several states of the earth, as in- 



dividuals under our declaration of 
rights, alike are entitled to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness. Toler- 
ation, respect for others' viewpoints 
and ways of life, leads to mutual un- 
derstanding and friendliness. 

Such gatherings as the International 
Peace Congress and the General Con- 
vention of the Episcopal Church, lately 
assembled in Boston, are significant 
factors in cultivating and disseminating 
the spirit of peaceful and friendly re- 
lations among the nations of the earth ; 
for toleration, plant of slow growth, is 
best cultivated and exemplified by 
practical experience. We grow in wis- 
dom and knowledge of the truth by 
contact with seekers for truth and 
light in other lands and climes. 

The longed for goal toward which 
all nations who dwell on the earth are 
contending is a state of peace. When 
the people of the earth come to know 
and regard each other as neighbors and 
friends, selfishness and strife will grad- 
ually disappear. As a means to the 
attainment of this end, we know of no 
better guiding principle than the truth 
that is contained in the following epi- 
grammatic "Recipe for having good 
neighbors: Be one." 

At this Thanksgiving season let us be 
thankful, above all things, for peace 
at home and hopeful signs of the uni- 
versal reign of the Prince of Peace. 

WOMEN WISER THAN MEN 

WOMEN are the inheritors of 
this old, universal human 
wisdom. They have more 
sense than men, for the simple rea- 
son that a man has to be a special- 
ist, and a specialist has to be a fanatic. 
The normal man all over the world is 
a hunter or a fisher, or a banker or a 
man of letters, or some silly thing. If 
so, he has to be a wise hunter or a wise 
banker. But nobody with the small- 
est knowledge of professional life would 



200 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



ever expect him to be a wise man. But 
his wife has to be a wise woman. She 
has to have an eye on everything, an 
eye on the things that fanatical bank- 
ers forget. If the banker is melan- 
choly, she must teach him ordinary 
cheerfulness. If the banker is too 
convivial, she must teach him ordi- 
nary caution. If she had four hus- 
bands (like Chaucer's Wife of Bath), 
she would be an optimist to the pessi- 
mist, a pessimist to the optimist, a 
Pagan to the Puritan, a Puritan to 
the Pagan. For she is the secret 
health of the world. — G. K. Chesterton. 



In a recent issue of the Medical Rec- 
ord the source of Japanese strength was 
thus interestingly analyzed: — 

"The Japanese are allowed to be 
among the very strongest people on 
earth. They are strong mentally and 
physically, and yet practically they eat 
no meat at all. The diet which enables 
them to develop such hardy frames 
and such well-balanced and keen brains 
consists almost wholly of rice, steamed 
or boiled, while the better-to-do add to 
this Spartan fare fish, eggs, vegetables, 
and fruit. For beverages they use 
weak tea, without sugar or milk, and 
pure water, alcoholic stimulants being 
but rarely indulged in. Water is im- 
bibed in what we should consider pro- 
digious quantities. To an Englishman, 
indeed, the drinking of so much water 
would be regarded as madness. The 
average Japanese individual swallows 
about a gallon daily in divided doses. 

"The Japanese recognize the bene- 
ficial effect of flushing the system 
through the medium of the kidneys, 
and they also cleanse the exterior of 
their bodies to an extent undreamed 
of in Europe or America. 

"Another — and perhaps this is the 
usage oh which the Japanese lay the 
greatest stress — is that deep, habitual 
forcible inhalation of fresh air is an 



essential for the acquisition of strength; 
and this method is sedulously prac- 
tised until it becomes a part of their 
nature." 

It is right and necessary that all 
men should have work to do which 
shall be worth doing, and be of itself 
pleasant to do, and which should be 
done under such conditions as would 
make it neither over-wearisome nor 
over-anxious. 

Turn that claim about as I may, 
think of it as long as I can, I cannot 
find that it is an exorbitant claim; yet, 
if society would or could admit it, the 
face of the world would be changed, 
discontent and strife and dishonesty 
would be ended. To feel that we were 
doing work useful to others and pleas- 
ant to ourselves, and that such work 
and its due reward could not fail us! 
What serious harm could happen to us 
then ? — William Morris. 

OUR readers will not fail to no- 
tice the new and special feat- 
ures of the present issue of .the 
Cooking-School Magazine. The merits 
and demerits of its table of contents we 
fain would leave to the kindly consid- 
eration of our readers and patrons. 
Our Christmas number will excel, we 
think, this our Thanksgiving number. 
We want to make each succeeding issue 
of the magazine better and better, until 
the journal becomes an indispensable 
aid to housekeepers throughout the 
land. With no spirit of the claimant 
or desire to make invidious compari- 
sons, we want to enable our readers to 
recommend the Cooking-School Maga- 
zine as the one strictly culinary publi- 
cation in this country, thoroughly reli- 
able in authority, practical in detail, 
and of superior excellence in every re- 
spect. Look out for the special Christ- 
mas number of the Cooking-School

Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 



IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting once. 
When flour is measured by cups, the cap is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. A 
tablespoon ful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such material. 



Oyster Cocktail (New Style) 
Mix two teaspoon fills of grated 
horseradish, one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of tabasco sauce, two tablespoonfuls 
of tomato catsup, the juice of two 
lemons, and about one teaspoonful of 
salt. Divide this liquid in six or eight 
glass cocktail cups, and set the cups in 
the centre of oyster plates supplied with 
cracked ice and five or six oysters, as for 
oysters on the half-shell. The cock- 
tail cup with sauce fills the space for- 
merly occupied by quarters of lemon. 
The oysters, taken on the fork, are 
dipped at will in the liquid. Sand- 
wiches of Boston brown bread or Gra- 



ham bread and butter are passed at 
the same time. 

Bouchees of Sardines and Cheese 
(Hors d'CEuvre) 

Have ready baked tiny puff-paste 
patties. These should not be more 
than an inch and a half or two inches 
in diameter. When ready to serve, 
reheat them, and fill the open spaces 
with the flesh of sardines pounded 
smooth and mixed with cheese melted 
in hot bechamel sauce and highly sea- 
soned with paprika. For a cup of 
sauce use a cup of grated cheese (not 
pressed down) and a dozen sardines.

Corned Beef Souffle 
Let two cups and a half of milk 
scald with half a cup of 
celery leaves or coarse stalks, 
cut in pieces, and half an 
onion, fifteen or twenty min- 
utes. Strain off the milk, 
and add to it cold milk to 
make one pint in all. Cook 
two tablespoonfuls of flour in 
two tablespoonfuls of melted 
butter. Add the milk, thus 
making a sauce. After the 
sauce has boiled, add half a 
cup of bread crumbs from 
the centre of a stale loaf, a 
few grains of salt, and a generous dash 
of paprika. Then stir in one pint of 
cold, cooked corned beef, chopped fine, 
and the yolks of three eggs, beaten light. 
Lastly, fold in the whites of three eggs, 
beaten dry, and turn the mixture into 
a buttered baking-dish. Bake about 
twenty-five minutes. Let the dish set, 
while cooking, on several folds of paper 
in a pan of hot water. Serve in the

Canned Blueberry Pie with Meringue 

with salt, pepper, and a tablespoonful 
of fine-chopped parsley. Mix thor- 
oughly, and serve in a hot dish. 

Citron Melon Preserves 
Cut the melons into quarters, and 
these into slices. Remove the green 
outer rind, and stamp the slices into 
shapes with small cutters, or cut them 
with a knife into pieces of such size 
and shape as is convenient. Remove 
the seeds. Cover the melon with cold 
water, adding a tablespoonful of salt 
to each quart of water. Let stand 
over night, then 
drain and rinse thor- 
oughly. Cook the 
pieces in boiling 
water until tender, 
then drain and weigh. 
For each pound of 
pieces make a syrup 
of three-fourths a 
pound of sugar and 
half a cup of water. , 

Skim, then add the 
melon and a lemon cut in thin slices, 
for each pound of melon. Simmer 
slowly until the pieces of melon look 
rich and full and the syrup is re- 
duced in consistency. Then store in 



glasses. A flavoring of ginger har- 
monizes well with this preserve. To 
secure, let an ounce of ginger root, for 
each probable pound of fruit, simmer 
in water to cover on the back of the 
range all day, replenishing the water 
as needed. Then use this water with 
the sugar in ir-king the syrup. 

Blueberry Pie with Meringue 
Beat the yolks of two eggs. Add 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice, and 
stir in three cups of uncooked blue- 
berries or two cups of canned berries. 
Pass together through a sieve, several 
times, one cup of sugar (scant meas- 
ure), two tables poonfuls of flour, and 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, then 
stir the mixture into the blueberry 
mixture, and turn the whole into a deep 
pie plate, lined with pastry as for a cus- 
tard pie. Bake about twenty-five min- 
utes, when the crust should be browned 
and the filling "set." When cooled a 
little, spread a meringue over the top, 
and return the pie to the oven for about 
eight minutes, to cook the meringue. 
Serve on the day of baking. 

Meringue 

A meringue may be made of the two 

whites left over from the filling, but 

one or two additional whites give a

with pastry, in a moderate 
oven, until the centre feels firm to 
the touch. 

Boiled Cider Apple Sauce 
Pare, quarter, and core one bushel 
of sweet apples; pour over these one 
gallon of boiled cider, cover closely, 
and cook very slowly about two hours 
or until tender, but not broken. Do 
not stir, but shake the kettle to avoid 
burning. 

Baked Indian Pudding 
Scald one pint of milk, and 
stir into it four level table- 
spoonfuls of yellow corn-meal 
mixed with a cup of cold 
water. Stir and cook until 
the mixture thickens slightly. 
Then add half a cup of mo-

stand over night in cold water. Bring 
quickly to the boiling-point, then sim- 
mer until tender. Reserve part of the 
prunes to ornament the dish. Re- 
move the stones from the rest, and cut 
or break the flesh into small pieces with 
a silver knife and fork. Boil three- 
fourths a cup of sugar with one-third 
a cup of the prune juice to the soft ball 
stage, then pour in a fine stream onto 
the white of an egg beaten until very 
light. Beat until cold, then add the 
pieces of prune, and fold in one cup of 
double cream and half a cup of single 
cream, beaten until firm to the bot- 
tom of the mould. Turn into a quart 
mould lined with paper (according to 
directions previously given in these 
pages), press the cover down over a 
sheet of paper spread over the top of 
the mixture, and pack the mould in 
equal measures of ice and salt. Let 
stand between one and two hours, re- 
newing the salt and ice, if needed.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 

In Reference to Thanksgiving Dinner 



WHEN Thanksgiving really 
comes, no matter if one has 
planned otherwise, tradition 
asserts itself, and the New England 
born housekeeper, wherever she may 
be, settles down on roast turkey as the 
central dish of her Thanksgiving dinner. 
The housekeeper wishing a really 
good turkey should not look for bar- 
gains. Bargains in food are apt to 
be dear in the end, and in nothing more 
so than in poultry and meats. A 
dealer knows where to purchase tur- 
keys of every grade ; and the reputable 
man having a reputation to live up to 
rarely buys but two grades, — fancy 
Eastern and young, first-grade Western 
birds. Order from him at an early 
day, and look on while he selects the 
fowl for you. At the same time one 
will not "give herself away" if she 
note the color of the legs, which should 
be black, and the breast bone, the end 
of which in a young fowl is pliable 
gristle rather than bone. Pin feathers 
indicate a young turkey, and many 
hairs an older one. 

For eight successive years we have 
trussed and roasted a turkey, that the 
illustration of how his majesty should 
look, when presented to public view on 
the Thanksgiving dinner tables of our 
readers, might be presented to them. 
This year we said, "The good people 
who look over our pages, year after 
year, must be tired of seeing turkeys 



all of which look just alike." Instead 
we will give them a fine picture of a 
baron of beef or, perhaps, a young pig, 
sweet and crisp. Just as this plan was 
all nicely settled, and a farmer who had 
a fine litter of pigs had been inter- 
viewed, our eye chanced to light on the 
following from a last year's literary 
magazine: "There is the inevitable 
scene of the universal dinner table with 
the indispensable turkey, whose up- 
lifted legs," etc. Surely, if the "indis- 
pensable turkey" must be on the "uni- 
versal Thanksgiving dinner table, "our 
duty to the "bird" was not yet 
done. Think of all those dry and 
tasteless drumsticks, filled with bony 
sinews! What a waste of good ma- 
terial! As we write early in October, 
fresh -killed turkeys are selling for 
forty-five cents a pound. If turkeys 
are to be sacrificed, that "all the world 
may have a holiday," why should not 
the sacrifice amount to something? 
If we are to live on bean porridge three 
hundred and sixty-four days, in order 
to have turkey on one, why throw the 
best joints away? A trussing needle 
costs eighteen cents, a dozen steel 
skewers of graduated sizes about the 
same, and only two of these latter are 
needed for trussing; and with either of 
these appliances it is but a few mo- 
ments' work to truss a fowl into neat and 
compact shape, no joint left exposed on 
more than one side to the drying heat 



After Breakfast Chat

of the oven. A piece of twine, carried 
from one skewer to another, on the 
back of the fowl, and firmly tied, will 
hold the skewers in place. The neck 
cut off in a line with the top of the 
collar bone will enrich the broth to be 
used in making the giblet sauce; and 
the skin of the neck, left uncut, may 
be turned over and fastened down 
under the string that holds the skewers 
in place. Or, better still, it may be 
held in place with a stitch taken up 
by the trussing needle, when it is 
passed back and forth through the 
wings, to hold them in place. 

Remember that every year turkeys 
by the score are made hard, indigesti- 
ble, dry, and tasteless, by cooking in 
too hot an oven. Gentle heat, after 
the searing over has been accomplished, 
will — other conditions being right — in- 
sure a turkey of such tenderness that 
the flesh beneath the well-browned 
skin may be cut with a spoon. 

If the turkey is to be stuffed, try a 
stuffing made of Graham or entire- 
wheat bread or even granose flakes. 
Moisten the crumbs or flakes with 
melted butter or mild-cured bacon fat, 
add poultry seasoning, salt and pepper, 
then use to fill the fowl, taking care not 
to press it in too firmly. Give it room 
to swell, lest, otherwise, it be too dense 
for proper digestion. If chestnut stuf- 
fing seems desirable, a pint of chestnuts 
or three cups, at most, will be enough 
to fill a ten-pound turkey. Blanch the 
chestnuts, boil until tender, then press 
through a ricer, after mashing them 
with a pestle. Add butter, salt, and 
pepper, and the mixture is ready for 
use. Bread crumbs, sausage, or chopped 
veal may be added at pleasure. To 
make the giblet sauce, pour off the 
fat from the pan in which the turkey 
was cooked, leaving about two table- 
spoonfuls in it. In this cook two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, then gradually 
add about a cup and a half of Hquid 
from the saucepan in which the giblets 



and neck were cooked. Let boil, then 
add the giblets, chopped fine, with salt 
and pepper as needed. 

Clear Cranberry Jelly 

For a novelty try clear cranberry 
jelly. It is pretty and delicate, but it 
will not give as general satisfaction as 
the recipe for cranberry jelly given so 
often in these pages. We give both 
formulas. For the clear jelly cook a 
quart of cranberries in a cup of water 
until the berries are softened, then turn 
into a flannel bag, and let the juice 
drain through without pressure. Meas- 
ure out an equal quantity of sugar. 
Reheat the juice, remove from the fire, 
stir in the sugar, and turn into glasses. 
To make the ordinary cranberry jelly, 
add a cup of water to a quart of cran- 
berries, cover, and let cook about five 
minutes after boiling begins. Press the 
pulp through a puree sieve and set into 
the upper part of a double boiler. Stir 
in one pint of sugar, and, without re- 
heating, turn into a mould. For a 
change this jelly may be moulded in a 
flat dish, and cut into small cubes for 
serving. 

Pumpkin and Squash Pie 

Custom decrees that pumpkin, not 
squash, pie shall hold the place of 
honor in the sweet course at the Thanks- 
giving dinner. We have heard people 
tolerably well versed in matters relating 
to food and the table say: "Oh, it was 
a squash or a pumpkin pie. I cannot 
tell them apart. Don't think there is 
much difference between them." But 
these were city born and bred. One 
brought up in the country knows that 
good squash are grown in the kitchen 
garden and only by the most vigilant 
attention, while the October cornfields, 
turned brown and sere by the early 
frost, are bright with the lavish display 
of tons of golden pumpkins, sown as 
a "stolen crop" between the sprouting 
hills of Indian corn; for the pumpkin

is easily grown. Squash and pumpkin 
belong to the same family as the gourd, 
melon, and cucumber. The squash is 
the aristocratic member of the family, 
and the pumpkin the plebeian. The 
field pumpkin is coarse-grained and of 
firm texture, requiring much time in 
cooking. The squash is fine-grained, 
and cooks quickly. 

Neither squash nor pumpkin is valu- 
able from a nutritive point of view; 
but the value of no member of the 
gourd family shows well, when esti- 
mated in calories. But who questions 
the food value of watermelons, when 
considering the pleasure which their 
consumption affords? In making pies 
from pumpkin and squash, food value 
is added by means of eggs and cream or 
milk, flavor or spiciness by mace, cin- 
namon, vanilla, or almond. While any 
of these flavors may be used at will in 
either a squash or a pumpkin pie, 
ginger is the spice which, by reason of. 
its use by the women of colonial times, 
is called for where pumpkin pies are 
fashioned for the Thanksgiving meal. 
We said eggs were added to increase 
the food value, but their use is neces- 
sary to make, up for the lack of thick- 
ening properties in both pumpkins and 
squash. Eggs being scarce, flour or 
cracker crumbs may be used instead. 
A fresh baked pumpkin pie is always 
preferable; but, made the day before- 
hand, let it feel the softening influence 
of a mildly heated oven before it is 
sent to the table. Pastry is probably 
found on nine-tenths of our Thanks- 
giving dinner tables. Let us hope that 
it is tender, flaky, and well baked. 
The "magic cover" (a duck cloth for 
board and a stockinet covering for the 
rolling-pin) will enable even a novice 
to roll out soft dough with ease. Of 
course, the rolling-pin should revolve 
on the handles. For a good but not 
too rich paste, two-thirds a cup of 
shortening to three cups of pastry 
flour, measured after sifting, is a good 



proportion. Half a teaspoonful of salt 
is necessary for most tastes, and half 
a teaspoonful of baking-powder will 
aid in securing the lightness which a 
delicate, deft touch . can occasionally 
give. These should be sifted with the 
flour. Cut the shortening into the 
flour with a chopping-knife, then, add- 
ing the water a little at a time, mix 
the ingredients to a dough. Knead 
just enough to form into a smooth 
mass, then cover, and let stand five or 
six minutes. Then pat and roll out 
into a long strip, roll up, and it is 
ready for use at once or later. All 
paste is handled more easily, if it be 
set aside "to ripen* ' a few hours or 
even over night. Before setting, aside, 
roll in waxed paper to exclude the air. 
A recipe for flaky pastry was given on 
page 176 of the October magazine. 
Those wishing Swedish timbale cases 
should consult query 939 of this issue. 

Baked Indian pudding is most ap- 
propriate at a Thanksgiving dinner. 
The recipe given is sufficient to serve 
six or eight, when the pudding is the 
only dessert provided. Maple sugar, 
grated, and cream complete the dish, 
though for a more pretentious dessert 
maple ice-cream might take the place 
of the sugar and cream. This pudding 
is exceedingly delicate and well worth a 
trial. The heat of the oven must be 
very moderate, or the pudding will be 
a failure. 

In the menu for the mining camp, 
chopped nuts may be added, with the 
poultry seasoning, to the ordinary 
bread dressing and the whole baked 
in a roll, with frequent basting. Bacon 
or pork fat is good for this basting. 
Condensed milk, diluted with water 
in the proportion of one to two parts 
of water to one of milk, and one or 
two crackers, rolled fine, may take the 
place of the milk and eggs given in the 
usual recipes for pumpkin pie. The 
eggs may be omitted from the Indian 
pudding.

Coffee. Milk, Hot and Cold. Marmalade. 

The above menu provides food for 
a family of adults and children, and 
fairly represents an American break- 
fast. We will suppose that it is to be 
served English fashion, from the table. 
First let us notice the "laying of the 
table."- Over the polished top of the 
table spread a heavy cover of felt, 
double-faced canton flannel, or some 
similar material. Fasten this securely 
about the table legs, that it may not 
slide about upon the polished surface. 
This cover will protect the table top, 
deaden the sound made in setting 
down china, etc., and improve the ap- 
pearance of even the finest linen. Over 
this cover spread the damask cloth, 
having the fold of the cloth exactly in 



the centre of the table with opposite 
edges of the cloth at uniform distances 
from the floor. 

At the centre of the table place a 
dish of fruit, a growing plant, or cut 
flowers. The plate, napkins, glasses, 
and cutlery set in place for each indi- 
vidual at the beginning of a meal are 
designated "the cover." The plate, of 
breakfast size, and the cutlery are set 
half an inch from the edge of the table. 
The decorations of the plate-should face 
the sitter at table. At the right of the 
plate and near it lay a knife, the cut- 
ting edge toward the plate. At the 
right of the knife lay a dessert spoon 
for the cereal. On the left of the plate 
lay a fork of breakfast size with tines 
turned upward. At the point of the 
knife set a tumbler for water, and be- 
side it another for milk. At the point 
of the fork set a small plate for bread, 
hot muffins, and butter, and across this 
lay a small knife or "spreader." 

At the left of the fork lay a napkin, 
above the plate a dessert spoon, and 




2l6 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



above this a fruit napkin with finger 
bowl beside it. 

Between each two covers dispose 
salt and pepper sets, also carafes for 
water. Above the cover at the foot 
of the table set out the required num- 
ber of coffee cups and saucers, with a 
spoon beside each. Near these dis- 
pose the cream- jug and a bowl of cut 
sugar. In front of these place, if 
needed, stands for hot milk and coffee. 
Two minutes before breakfast is an- 
nounced fill the glasses with water, set 
butter and cold bread upon the bread 
plates. Set also on the table an extra 
supply of these two articles. The 
family now being seated at table, set 
the dish of grapes before the head of the 
table, and lay the grape shears beside 
the dish. Bring in each hand a plate 
from the sideboard, and set one down 
between "the cover" and the grape 
dish. When it has been made ready, 
take it up and set down the second 
plate. Put the filled plate down, from 
the right, upon the breakfast plate of 
the one for whom it was made ready; 
and, taking another plate from the 
sideboard, return to the head of the 
table. Take up the prepared plate 
and set down the other, and so con- 
tinue until all have been served. When 
this course has been finished, take out, 
first, the dish of grapes, then, setting the 
finger bowl upon the fruit plate, take 
out plate, bowl, and spoon, together, 
one set in each hand. 

Now bring in the cereal in a cov- 
ered dish on a tray. Set the dish 
down before the head of the table, a 
tablespoon at the right of it. Remove 
the cover, reverse it to avoid drops of 
water (condensed steam), and take it 
on the tray to the serving-table or 
pantry. Return with sugar and cream 
(if these were not in place at the be- 
ginning of the meal), then return with 
a cereal dish or saucer in each hand 
or on a tray. Set one down between 
"the cover," and the cereal dish, and, 



when it is made ready (with cream 
and sugar as desired), replace it with 
the second dish, and carry to him or 
her for whom it was prepared, setting 
it down at the right. Individual pref- 
erences and the time that can be given 
to serving and clearing up a meal have 
to be considered in connection with 
many points of table management. 
Many prefer that the cereal dish 
.be presented upon a breakfast plate, 
and that both together be substituted 
for the plate in the cover. This calls for 
more dish-washing; but it has its ad- 
vantages, especially when the cereal 
has been creamed. In either case, the 
waitress or the server may lift the dish to 
the tray, according to preference. The 
cereal course finished, the cereal dish 
is first removed, then the sugar and 
cream, and, lastly, the individual dishes, 
one in each hand, or two side by side on 
a tray. All piling of dishes is to be 
avoided, in any case. 

Now replenish the glasses with water, 
and pour milk for those who desire it. 
Set the platter of Hamburg cakes and 
the dish of potatoes before the head 
of the table. Lay a small carving 
knife at the right of the platter, a table- 
spoon beyond and nearer the platter, 
a carving fork at the left of the platter, 
and a spoon at the right of the potato 
dish. Set the dish of hot muffins on 
the table. Bring two warmed plates. 
Set down one between the meat platter 
and the cover. When filled, take up 
with the right hand, set down the plate 
in the left hand, and carry the filled 
plate to the foot of the table. Take 
back a plate in the left hand, and sub- 
stitute it for the plate made ready to 
serve. Set this down before the one 
next in order, and in this manner serve 
all upon one side of the table and then 
those upon the other side. Pass the 
muffins and the bread. Supply butter, 
if needed. When the coffee is ready, 
set the cups down at the right of those 
for whom they are specially prepared. 



The Up-to-Date Waitress 



217 



Pass the marmalade to the left, that 
those who wish it may help themselves. 
The marmalade may be placed on the 
bread-and-butter plate or on the break- 
fast plate. 

The waitress has now more opportu- 
nity to look about and see what is 
needed by any one; and butter, muf- 
fins, bread, or the potato dish, may be 
passed to the left of those in need, that 
each may help himself. Keep the 
glasses supplied with milk and water. 

Luncheon and dinner are served upon 
the same general plan. At dinner the 
roast and fish are served from the head 
of the table; and the soup, salad, and 
sweet course from the opposite end 
of the table. The same holds good at 
luncheon, save that a roast is not given 
place in the menu. 

Points to be remembered in Serving 

' All Meals 

i. The room must be in order, clean, 
free from dust, and well aired. The 
temperature should be at about 70 F. 

2. The linen should be immaculate, 
the china and glass glistening, and the 
silver well polished. 

3. The plate marks the centre of each 
cover. 

4. Knives are placed at the right, 
forks to the left of the plate, the cut- 
ting edges of knives are toward the 
plate, the tines of the forks and bowls 
of spoons are turned upwards. 

5. Plates, knives, forks, and spoons 
are set half an inch from the edge of 
the table, and are disposed in the order 
of use, the first used farthest from the 
plate. 



6. Warn} all dishes for hot foods and 
chill those for cold food. To warm, 
rinse in hot water and dry or set into 
the warming oven. 

7. Fill glasses with water and set 
butter in place the last thing before 
announcing that meals are served. 

Points to be remembered in Serving 
Meals after the English Style 

1. The food is served from the table. 

2. Save relishes, bread and butter, 
and such articles as pertain alike to 
all courses up to the sweet course, 
only one course appears at a time upon 
the table. 

3. Pass all dishes, from which food 
is to be taken, to the left of those at 
table. 

4. Set all portions at the right of 
the individual for whom they are pre- 
pared. 

5. Everything pertaining to one 
course must be removed before serving 
another course. 

6. In clearing the table for another 
course: 

(1) Remove food. 

(2) Remove soiled china, glass, and 
silver. 

(3) Remove clean china, glass, 
and silver pertaining to the courses 
served. 

7. In clearing the table for the sweet 
course, remove as above, including 
under food bread, butter, and relishes, 
then (4) free the table from crumbs, 
using silver implements for a table 
covered with damask, a napkin and 
plate when the meal is served on the 
polished table top.

Our Thanksgiving Pie Fruit 

By Mary Foster Snider 



THE pumpkin is generally be- 
lieved to be an American spe- 
cialty. Our forefathers found 
it growing in the Indian corn fields, and 
for this reason we have cherished the 
idea that this gold-colored vegetable 
had come to us by a special dispensa- 
tion. History informs us to the con- 
trary, however, as various other coun- 
tries have made use of the pumpkin to 
support life and please the palate. We 
may indeed lay claim to the pumpkin 
pie as a strictly American dainty, the 
invention of which is properly cred- 
ited to some ambitious colonial dame. 
Were this lady's admirers as numerous 
and enthusiastic as the lovers of the 
delectable compound, a monument 
would speedily be erected to her name 
and fame. 

Other nationalities have used the 
pumpkin in different ways, yet they 
seem to have taken very kindly to the 
American pumpkin pie, the addition 
of pastry to the fruit making it espe- 
cially pleasing to French and German 
taste. In Prance the pumpkin is 
called potiron, and it is cleverly used 
in making soups, purees, creams, tarts, 
and other entremets. The French 
also make a pumpkin cake or pudding, 
which is extremely palatable. In Ger- 
many the pumpkin is called Kurbis, 
and is used quite extensively. 

The average pumpkin pie has de- 
generated into a spicy affair, wherein 
both the color and flavor of the pump- 
kin are destroyed; and it is not always 
possible to know whether squash, tur- 
nips, potatoes, or pumpkin, forms the 
filling. Properly made, the pie should 
retain all the rich golden color and 
flavor peculiar to the fruit, only a sus- 
picion of the flavor of Ceylon's spicy 
groves being allowable. 



In our present splendid variety and 
plenitude of food materials we have 
almost forgotten how extensively the 
pumpkin was used in cooking by our 
great-grandmothers. When America 
was discovered, fields of pumpkins were 
found growing around the Indian vil- 
lages, and the red men depended upon 
them as one of their main crops. Be- 
fore long the colonials had learned to 
value these golden globes of fruit, and 
served them not only in pies and 
puddings, but in sauces and preserves 
as well. Stewed in a little water and 
boiled cider, pumpkin sauce was a 
favorite dish, feaked in its yellow 
jacket and seasoned to taste, it was as 
popular as baked squash is with us. 

The following recipes are excellent, 
and in many households will prove both 
novel and delicious: — 

Stewed Pumpkin 

Peel and remove the seeds from a 
pumpkin. Parboil, wipe with a cloth, 
and cut into small pieces. Put three 
ounces of butter in a saucepan, and, 
when it is melted, add the pumpkin. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper 
and a very little grated nutmeg, and 
toss over the fire until quite soft. 
Butter a baking-dish, and turn in the 
mixture. Sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese and a few fine bread crumbs. 
Place in a hot oven, and serve very hot 
as soon as the top is lightly browned. 

Baked Pumpkin 

Cut the pumpkin into quarter-inch 
slices, and pare off the rind. Put a 
layer in the bottom of a buttered pud- 
ding-dish, and sprinkle with sugar, a 
very little cinnamon, and some bits of 
butter. Repeat this until the dish is 
full, having the top thickly sprinkled

with sugar. Bake in a moderate oven, 
until the sugar on top has cooked to 
a thick syrup. Another pleasing way 
to serve baked pumpkin is from the 
shell. Cut the fruit in large pieces of 
neat shape, and put in a baking-pan 
with a very little water. Sprinkle very 
lightly with sugar and a mere dusting 
of cinnamon, and dot with little bits of 
butter. Bake until tender, sprinkle 
with salt, and serve hot from the shell. 

Pumpkin Fritters 

Select rather small* oval pumpkins. 
Cut them in long, square fingers, pare, 
and lay them in a dish. Sprinkle with 
salt, and let stand ten minutes, shaking 
the dish from time to time. Drain 
the pieces, wipe with. a cloth, and rub 
them over with flour or very fine 
bread crumbs. Pry a few at a time in 
hot fat or cooking oil. When nicely 
browned, dust them with a little salt, 
and serve on a heated dish. 

Pumpkin Loaf 

Mash fine a quart of stewed or baked 
pumpkin. Add a teaspoonful, each, of 
salt and baking soda, one tablespoon- 
ful of sugar, and three pints of white 
corn-meal. Mix all together while hot, 
and steam four hours, or it may be 
baked the last hour, if a crisper crusty 
is preferred. Serve hot with sweet- 
ened cream. 

Pumpkin Fanchionettes 

Sift enough dry, steamed pumpkin 
to fill a cup, and add to it one-half a 
cup of sugar, one cup of rich, sweet 
milk, two eggs, slightly beaten, two 
tablespoonfuls, each, of molasses and 
melted butter, one-half a tablespoon- 
ful of ginger, one teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, and one-half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Mix thoroughly, and fill into 
patty-pans which have been lined with 
rich pastry. Bake about twenty-five 
minutes in a moderate oven. These 
are as pleasing served for individual 



pies at Thanksgiving as little plum 
puddings are for Christmas. 

Pumpkin Pudding 

To a pint of cooked pumpkin add a 
pint of hot cream, one-fourth a pound 
of butter, and one-fourth a pound of 
granulated sugar. Add a teaspoonful 
of powdered mace and cinnamon mixed 
together, half a grated nutmeg, and 
eight eggs beaten until very light. 
Beat the mixture thoroughly together, 
turn into a buttered pudding-dish, and 
bake three-quarters of an hour in a 
hot oven. Serve cold. 

Pumpkin Indian Pudding 

Mix a pint and a half of Indian meal 
and a tablespoonful of ground ginger 
with a pint and a half of cooked-and- 
sifted pumpkin. Stir one pint of mo- 
lasses into one quart of boiling milk. 
Add, stirring hard, the meal and pump- 
kin, with the grated rind of a lemon. 
Tie in a pudding bag, and cook in boiling 
water for four hours. The water must 
not be allowed to stop boiling for an 
instant, and, as it boils away, should 
be replenished from a kettle of boiling 
water. This pudding is excellent 
warmed over, should any be left. 

Pumpkin Pie 

Select a small, fine-grained pumpkin. 
Steam or bake it until perfectly tender, 
then press through a colander. To a 
pint of the sifted pumpkin add one 
quart of rich milk, three well-beaten 
eggs, one small cup of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of ginger, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Line two deep pie-tins 
with good pastry, pour in the pumpkin 
mixture, sift a little sugar and a dust- 
ing of nutmeg over the top, and bake 
until firm in the centre and golden 
brown in color. 

Pumpkin Butter 

Weigh the cooked pumpkin, allow 
the same weight in granulated sugar, 



220 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



and four tablespoonfuls of butter to 
two pounds of pumpkin. Add any 
spice preferred, and let simmer on the 
back of the range until thick and rich. 
Seal. 

Pumpkin Chips 

Pare and slice the pumpkin, and re- 
move the seeds. Cut it into chips 
about the size of a dollar and as thin 
as possible. To each pound of the 
chips allow one pound of loaf sugar 
and one gill of lemon juice. Before 
squeezing the lemons, grate off the thin 
yellow rind, and add it to the sugar. 
Put the chips in a preserving kettle in 
layers with the sugar, pour over them 
the lemon juice, and let stand over 
night. The next day let it simmer very 
slowly until the chips are clear and 
tender. Take them up on a perforated 
spoon, and spread on large plates to 
cool. When cold, put them in jars, 
pour the syrup over them boiling hot, 
and seal. These are delicious. A 
tablespoonful of powdered ginger tied 
in a piece of muslin may be added to 
each three pounds of the chips while 
they are cooking, if the flavor is liked. 

Pumpkin Preserves 
Slice and peel the pumpkin the night 



before the preserves are to be made. 
Cut into squares. To one pound of 
pumpkin allow three-fourths a pound 
of granulated sugar, and put in layers 
in a preserving kettle. In the morning 
the fruit will be floating in syrup. Add 
spices and lemon to suit the taste, 
bring to scalding heat, then take off 
the fire, and let get cold. Boil again 
for a little while, and cool once more. 
Then return to the fire, and simmer 
until rich and transparent. If cooked 
in this way, the pumpkin will be firm 
and clear like rich preserved citron. 

Pumpkin Marmalade 

Select ripe, deep yellow pumpkins 
for this. Cut into large pieces, pare, 
and scrape out • the seeds and soft, 
stringy part. To every pound allow 
one pound of granulated sugar, one 
orange, and one lemon. Grate the 
pieces of pumpkin, and put them in the 
preserving kettle with the sugar in 
layers. Add the grated rind of the 
lemon and orange and the strained 
juice. Let it boil slowly, stirring fre- 
quently with a wooden spoon. Cook 
until smooth and thick, skim carefully, 
and pour into glasses. When cold, seal 
like jelly. This is especially nice in 
tarts or as a filling for emergency pies. 



The Child's World 

By Jane Dramficld Stone 



Not ours, but full of things we know, 
Of sunshine, birds, and winds that blow, 
The common things that elders deem 
But ordinary happenings mean, 
Yet looked upon by childish eyes, 
Are things of wonder and surprise. 

The flowers are fairy queen and sprite, 
The dog's a beast of fearful might, 
The milkman rattling in his cart 
Is charioteer with fiery dart, 
The thunder is a monstrous thing 
With yellow jaws and ink-black wing. 



A magic builder is the child. 
With wooden blocks together piled 
He rears enchanted castles high 
Or weighted boats that busy ply 
The carpet river, running green 
Its ruggy shores so smooth between. 

What in that world are you and I ? 
Crude strangers that oft tread too nigh, 
Great giants whose strange ways and looks 
Are worse than those in picture-books. 
Hence, elders, let us each beware 
Lest all too rude we enter there.

"Boston Cooking-School Magazine," 

Boston, Mass. 

Dear Mrs. Hill, — I was interested in 
your recipe for serving alligator pears 
(page 153, the Boston Cooking School 
Magazine for October), and wondered 
if vou had seen the little article on 
this fruit on pages 21-23 of Expert 
ment Station Work No. 22. I enclose 
a copy. 

I am very fond of alligator pear as 
a salad, when th* pulp is removed with 
a spoon and placed on lettuce leaves, 
and dressed with oil, vinegar, salt, and 
pepper. A friend from Guatemala tells 
me that it is quite commonly served 
as a breakfast food in that country, 
being cut in halves, the pit removed, 
and the pit cavity filled with claret 
and cracked ice. The pulp is also 
sometimes added to soup, and is also 
eaten spread upon bread and salted. 
Your way of serving it is new to me, 
and I am anxious to try it. 

As may be seen by the analysis on 
page 23 of the bulletin referred to, the 
fruit is remarkable, since it contains 
such a large percentage of fat in the 
fresh substance. After considerable 
search I found a report of a chemical 
study of this fat. It differs in several 
ways from the fats ordinarily found in 
our vegetable foods. Alligator pears 
are in season in this market from about 
the middle of July to the middle of 
November. • The price is fairly high; 
but I hope that the crop will increase 



from year to year, so that they may 
become common and inexpensive. 

C. F. Langworthy. 



My dear Mrs. Hill, — Some three 
months ago I wrote you asking advice 
concerning the preserving of soft-shell 
clams and juice for winter use. I val- 
ued your reply, requesting me, if 
successful, to acquaint you with my 
method. While at our summer home 
on Cape Cod, we procured several 
bushels of soft-shell clams, and, after 
letting them stand in salt sea water 
for four hours to remove the sand 
from within the shell, we put them into 
a large boiler without any water, and 
allowed them to steam in their own 
juice, which they expelled, upon feeling 
the heat, until the shells opened. We 
then strained the juice through a cheese- 
cloth bag, boiled it to half the quantity, 
and, to be perfectly sure of avoiding 
fermentation, I added a tablespoonful 
of boric acid powder to one gallon of 
juice. This probably had no effect, as 
we think the juice would have kept 
anyway. We bottled the juice in Hires 
Root Beer bottles, placing a thin layer 
of baked cotton under the top before 
clamping it. We find this bouillon de- 
licious, diluted with hot water or served 
with cracked ice in summer, and cannot 
tell it from the original. We failed ut- 
terly to preserve the clams, though we 
took the greatest care with them. The 
thought of the home preserving of 
bouillon had occurred to so few per- 
sons that we were astonished. 
Very truly yours, 

Mrs. E. H. J.

welcome a toy one in pottery 
on a pretty dish. 

Julia Davis Chandler. 



A CHARMING little oddity, suit- 
able for the Thanksgiving table, 
is to be found for sale in New 
York, and perhaps elsewhere. It is 
a green basket of pottery, with a 
bright glaze, about five inches in 
diameter and shallow. On the edge 
is perched a very lifelike turkey 
"gobbler," in natural colors, head 
erect and defiant, looking as if, when 
about to pick up some corn from 
the basket, he had seen some one 
approaching. It is well suited for 
salted almonds and other nuts, or 
for candies, and costs but a trifle. 
For a souvenir one by each plate 
would be novel and pleasing. The 
writer, not wishing to wait until 
Thanksgiving, presented one to a 
friend, who, not being the happy 
possessor of a home and a sideboard, 
placed Mr. Gobbler upon her bureau, 
where he bends over a collection of 
rings or buttons and pins, as if about 
to fill his gizzard with something good 
and hard to grind his food. 

The turkey is our famous bird, next 
to the eagle, and much more unique. 
Soon to become as extinct as the buf- 
falo, he has taken more kindly to do- 
mestic ways, and is the ornament of 
many farms. Differentiated into many 
colors, buff, white, slate-gray, and the 
most beautiful bronze, at all country 
fairs the turkey pens are sure to attract 
people who at other times seldom think

Irish Bacon 

WE have all heard about Paddy's 
pig, — "the strake of fat for the 
days the pig got fed and the strake of 
lane" (lean) for the days Paddy for- 
got him; and his "cure" was harder 
on him still. But that pigs are sore 
to get fed and cured into fine bacon 
is shown by the fact that "Irish 
bacon" is a sign displayed by fine im- 
porting grocers. It sells for thirty- 
five cents a pound. 

It takes a good cook to make some 
of the plainest dishes. Liver and 
bacon is one example. The bacon 
needs quick cooking, the livers lower 
by far. Two processes are needed, and 
the two things united for serving. 

In New England, bacon is used less 
than in other sections; but instead 
the unsmoked pickled fat pork, called 
there "salt pork," which is quite dif- 
ficult to obtain elsewhere, is used for 
baked beans, fricassee of chicken, New 
England style, and with fresh fish for 
frying and for chowders.

Paper Flowers 

THE country hostess remote from 
greenhouses, and even the city 
resident who desires to entertain often, 
but who finds the contents of a slender 
purse insufficient to purchase flowers 
for table decoration, may often use 
paper flowers with most artistic re- 
sults if they are not placed too near 
the plates, and are cunningly covered 
as much as possible with delicate green- 
ery, that may be kept growing in the 
kitchen window. In fact, parsley may 
be used for this purpose, if at hand, 
and nothing better is available. Hardy 
ferns may be used, and their price is

only five cents per bunch. A bunch 
of well-made roses or carnations, mixed 
with ferns and placed in a tall glass 
vase, will make a very pretty decoration 
for any evening entertainment, if placed 
where they will not be handled by the 
guests; but do not make the mistake of 
leaving them in the room for two or 
three weeks, as is sometimes done. If 
one has a few dozen of these flowers in 
the house, it is surprising on how 
many occasions they may be used 
without being offensive to good taste; 
and, if carefully dusted and put away, 
the same flowers may be used many 
times. Two things should always be 
remembered: the flowers must be so 
artistically made as to closely resemble 
the natural blossoms (this can be 
done); and any general use of them 
in the living-rooms of the house, where 
they are to remain day after day, is 
very unpleasant to the eye.

Cutting Brown Bread 

A STEAMING loaf of brown-bread 
requires a remarkably sharp knife 
to cut it successfully, and the best of 
knives become rapidly clogged with the 
adhesion of the hot moist substance. 
Victorious the housekeeper who keeps 
her temper through the entire loaf! 
A most satisfactory substitute is the 
1 'string cut" accomplished by means 
of a common piece of twine, and no 
trouble at all. Slip the string around 
the loaf, cross the ends, pull tight, and 
the result is a clean, even cut. 

HALF a slice of bread in the cake 
tin will keep a loaf of cake moist 
long enough for "the small family" to 
enjoy it to the end.

Cooking Wild Duck 

A "reader" of our magazine writes: 
"In a cook-book of recent date, by 
a well-known authority, is a recipe 
for roasting wild duck in which twenty 
minutes to half an hour is the time 
mentioned for cooking. In the article 
on 'How to Cook Wild Duck,' published 
in the August-September number of 
your magazine, the writer says, 'If 
young and tender, an hour or an hour 
and a half will be sufficient. 1 How 
would they taste?" 

Dear "reader," a young wild duck 
filled with stuffing, roasted an hour or 
even an hour and a half in a gentle 
heat, after the initial searing over has 
been accomplished, is a tender morsel, 
called good by large numbers of 
people. But a duck thus cooked would 
be ruined for those who wish the dark 
red juice to follow the knife. There is 
a marked difference in the appearance 
and taste of ducks cooked half an hour 
and an hour and a half respectively. 
But it is quite another matter to dis- 
tinguish differences of a few seconds or 
minutes, as in the following case. A 
party of hunters, fearing lest the cook 
should keep their ducks in the oven too 
long, deputed one of their number to 
stay in the kitchen — watch in hand — 
while the cooking was going on. When 
the ducks had been in the oven twenty 
minutes, time was called, and the ducks 
sent to the table. The general opinion 
was that eighteen minutes rather than 
twenty should have been the time of 
cooking.

QuBry 939.— Mrs. B. M. P., Lincoln, Neb.: 
"How may one secure Swedish timbale cases 
free from bubbles and pin-holes, and rising 
to the same height on the iron? Why 
are macaroons at times hollow or with- 
out any bottom? What is the correct pro- 
portion of eggs and sugar for meringues?

eggs? How prevent stringing without the 
use of rings? Doesn't vinegar tend to dis-

and temperature to secure a creamy fudge, 
free from granulation? In pounding almonds 
for soup, how prevent oiling? What ginger 
root is suitable for preserving, and does it 
swell when cooked ? Recipe for preserved 
ginger root." 

Regarding Swedish Timbale Cases 
In order that Swedish timbale cases 
may always rise to the same height 
on the iron, the iron needs be dipped 
into the batter each time to exactly 
the same height. These cases will 
be more free from pin-boles and bubbles 
of air if yolks of egg only be used in 
their preparation; that is, use two 
yolks of egg in the place of the whole 



egg given in the usual formula for 
making these cases. As yolk of egg 
contains more oil than the whites, 
the small quantity of olive oil given 
in the recipes may be omitted. We 
have not noted the temperature of 
the fat, with a thermometer, when fry- 
ing these cases. 

Why Macaroons are Hollow 

Probably the macaroons are hollow 

on the bottoms on account of too 

strong heat below. They require a 

moderately heated oven. 

Proportions of Egg and Sugar for 
Meringues 
Try three cups of fine-granulated 
sugar to one cup of egg whites. 

Temperature for Poaching Eggs 
An egg cooked at a temperature 

of 160 F. is tender and jelly-like. 

It loses this consistency at 200° F. 

On this account the ideal temperature 



226 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



would be between these two degrees, — 
probably at about 1 85 F. An egg 
two or three days old, possibly a week 
old, carefully broken into a saucer, 
may be slipped into the water with 
little or no ' 'stringing." Such an 
egg can be cooked, with no detriment 
to its shape, without the use of a ring 
or any similar contrivance. Vinegar 
does sometimes discolor the white 
of an egg when it is added to the water 
in which eggs are to be cooked. On 
this account lemon juice is preferable, 
but the gain with either in practice 
is very slight. 

Creamy Fudge ^without Granulation 

Cook the ingredients until, when 
tested in cold water, the candy may 
be collected into a soft ball. Begin 
to test after boiling about ten minutes. 
For a particularly smooth, creamy 
fudge, use cream in the place of milk, 
and stir no more than is absolutely 
necessary while the ingredients are 
boiling, and again while the candy is 
cooling. See also answer to Query 
920. 

Pounding Almonds for Soup 

To keep almonds from oiling when 
pounding them for soup, add occa- 
sionally a teaspoonful or more of cold 
water. The quantity depends upon 
the quantity of almonds. 

Ginger Root for Preserving 

The best ginger root for preserving 
is what is called ' 'stem ginger root." 
It comes in small, roundish pieces, 
about an inch or an inch and a half 
in diameter. It is very tender, and 
contains little or no tough woody 
fibre. It swells a little when cooked. 

Preserved Ginger Root 

Cover the ginger root with cold 
water. Let simmer until tender, then 
skim from the water. Of the ginger 
water and sugar, equal in weight to 



the original weight of the root, make 
a syrup, and in this let the root sim- 
mer until it is a rich dark color, and 
the syrup thick.

Tomato Jelly 

Cook three cups of canned tomatoes, 
a slice of onion, a stalk of celery, a 
piece of bay leaf, two cloves, and a 
piece of red-pepper pod about fifteen 
minutes. Add a tablespoonful of tar- 
ragon vinegar, if at hand, a teaspoonful

Uses of Tomato Jelly 

Tomato jelly is served with salad 
dressing, preferably in connection with 
celery, lettuce, cabbage, cauliflower, 
or with eggs, etc. Cut in cubes, it is 
a pretty decoration, which adds to the 
bulk of a chicken or fish salad. It is 
often moulded in a ring mould or in 
individual charlotte russe moulds. In

"In serving refreshments at an 'at home* or 
'tea,' would you give napkins to guests 
standing about the rooms ? Kindly give pro- 
nunciation and meaning of hots d'ctuvres and 
entrees, and what dishes are served as entrees." 

Napkins at Teas, etc. 

At large teas, etc., where guests are 
served standing, napkins may be found 
easy of access, in piles, on sideboard, 
serving or other table; but they are 
passed infrequently. Those wishing 
them help themselves or ask for them. 

Hors d'CEuvres 
The literal meaning of hors d'ctuvres 



is out of work. The pronunciation is 
French, tr* d&vr f . In cooking, it means 
something small served at the begin- 
ning of the meal or before the meal 
proper. The little relishes that are in- 
cluded under this term are usually cold, 
but may be either hot or cold. The 
three essentials are smallness in size, 
neatness in appearance, and piquancy 
in flavor. 

Entree 

An entree is a side-dish served be- 
tween the courses and sometimes with 
the joint or roast. It is an extra dish, 
the meal being complete in make-up 
without it. The pronunciation is also 
French, &n' trh!. Meat, fish, eggs, vege- 
tables, or fruit, may form the founda- 
tion of an entree; and this may be 
either hot or cold. Entries are served 
in individual portions. If not so 
shaped originally, they are separated 
into portions before they are presented 
at table. Exception is made of dishes, 
like a sliced tongue in aspic, which, 
when passed, is easily separated into 
portions. Entries may be fashioned 
of new material procured especially for 
this purpose or of left-over materials.

Use of Pastry Bag and Tube 

Fix the tube in place at the nar- 
row end of the bag. Roll outward the 
upper part of the bag so as to put the 
mixture just above the tube without 
smearing the sides of the bag. Fill the 
bag about one-third full. With the 
right hand carefully twist the bag above 
the mixture, guide the tube with the 
left hand, and force out the mixture 
by continuing the twisting, at the same 
time using pressure with the right 
hand. To form a star, hold the bag 
in vertical position and press out a

sufficient quantity of the mixture. 
Separate the tube from the material by 
pressing the tube downwards slightly 
and raising it quickly. For other de- 
signs hold the bag at other angles, be- 
tween the vertical and a horizontal po- 
sition. 

Red-pepper Cases with Rice 

Butter timbale moulds thoroughly, 
and into each fit a canned pimento or 
sweet red pepper, cutting the edge even 
with the edge of the mould. Have 
ready blanched rice cooked tender in 
salted boiling water. Add two table- 
spoonfuls or more of butter and one 
teaspoonful of fine-chopped parsley 
or chives. Mix gently, to avoid break- 
ing the grains, and fill the lined moulds 
with the rice, pressing it in lightly, to 
fill the moulds solidly. Set the moulds 
on several folds of paper in a pan of 
boiling water, and let cook in the oven 
fifteen minutes. Then turn from the 
moulds around the article with which 
they are to be served. In cooking the 
rice, use a covered dish and no more 
water than the rice will absorb. White 
stock may replace the water, and onion 
juice may be added, if a richer-flavored 
dish is wished.

Query 946.— L. E. N., Sierra City, Cal.: "I 
would be glad of suggestions as to the use of 
canned goods and condensed milk; also of 
recipes for desserts that do not require eggs." 

Dishes with Canned Goods 

The Borden Condensed Milk Com- 
pany's products have stood the test 
of time, and we cheerfully recommend 
them. In articles to be sweetened the 
Eagle brand of milk may be used, and 
in cream soups or other savory dishes, 
in which milk or cream is called for, 
use the Peerless brand of Evaporated 
Cream, which is unsweetened. We 
know of no way in which this cream 
may be whipped, as you desire, unless 
it be by the use of a small quantity of 
gelatine. Soften a scant teaspoonful 
of gelatine in one-fourth a cup of water, 
and dissolve by adding one-fourth a 
cup of boiling water. When cooled a 
. little, add half, a cup of evaporated 
cream, sugar and flavoring to taste; 
and, when the whole is ready to set, 
beat with a Dover egg-beater to a 
firm foam. Use only enough gelatine 
to hold up the froth. 

By the use of either of these articles 
delicious ice-cream may be made, 
and of any desired flavor. Canned 
berries or fruits may be used to vary 
these dishes. There are wholesome 
preparations on the market, which do 
away with the use of eggs in sweet.

Then add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
one teaspoonful of salt, and from one- 
fourth to one-half a cup of melted 
butter. Mix together, and work in 
flour to make between six and seven 
cups in all. This is a rather soft dough. 
Knead until elastic, fifteen or twenty 
minutes, then cover, and set aside to 
become very light. Knead the dough, 
and shape into a round mass. Cut in 
halves, then in quarters, and shape 
the quarters, to aid in cutting in pieces 
of the same size. Shape each of these 
into balls, then roll them on the board, 
to secure such shaped rolls as desired. 
Rolls with pointed ends or of equal 
size throughout, but two or three times 
as long as the width, are good shapes 
for dinner rolls. Set to rise in buttered 
pans, brushing the sides that may touch 
in baking with melted butter.' When 
very light, bake about twenty-five min- 
utes. For a glossy surface mix two 
teaspoonfuls of cornstarch with a 
little cold water. Pour on a cup of. 
boiling water, and let boil a few min- 
utes. When the rolls are nearly baked, 
brush over the upper surface with this 
starch, and return to the oven. Re- 
peat this glazing two or three times. 

Devil Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter. Beat 
into it, very gradually, one cup and a 
half of sugar, then add the beaten 
yolks of four eggs. Melt four ounces 
of chocolate over hot water, add five 
tablespoonfuls of hot water, and stir 
until smooth, then add to the other 
ingredients. Add alternately half a 
cup of milk and one cup and three- 
fourths of flour, sifted with one tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon and two level 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. Flavor 
with one teaspoonful of vanilla and beat 
in the whites of four eggs, beaten dry. 
Bake in a sheet or in layers. Finish

cup of fine-chopped French fruit has 
been added.

of currant jelly. It is also quite fre- 
quently served with a fancy cream 
cheese or with Neufchatel or cottage 
cheese, as a cheese course. Sweets may 
or may not follow such a course. 
Lemon cheese cakes with Bar-le-duc 
preserve are a particularly appropriate 
course for the ending of a formal 
luncheon. TJie preserve may be passed 
in the tiny tumbler in which it is im- 
ported.

quickly, and should be watched closely. 
When they have cooked sufficiently, 
spread out at once. When they have 
become quite cool, blanch as follows: 
This can be done by rubbing them in 
the hands or, what is better, a coarse 
bag. Another good device is a screen 
made of coarse wire. Rub them until 
the skins are loose. The chaff can be 
removed by using a fan or by pouring 
them from one dish to another where 
the wind is blowing. Look them over 
carefully, removing defective nuts and 
foreign substances. Always grind them 
when freshly cooked, as they do not 
make good butter when left a day or 
two after being cooked. Sprinkle salt 
on the kernels when grinding.' ' To 
use this butter, put one-half the quan- 
tity of butter required for the meal into 
a bowl, and dilute with an equal quan- 
tity of water. Add the water a little 
at a time, beating it in with a fork 
until the mixture is smooth and light. 
This butter will not keep in good con- 
dition but a few hours. 

Concerning Sandwiches 

At kitchen furnishing stores fancy- 
shaped cutters may be found. These 
are also useful for cutting little cakes 
and pastry. The cover of a baking- 
powder box makes a good cutter, if a 
nail be driven through it to make an 
opening to let out the air. A sand- 
wich in which one piece of bread is 
Boston brown bread and the other 
white bread, with nut butter, cream 
cheese, and chopped olives, or sardine 
paste between, makes an attractive 
sandwich. Dispose these on a plate in 
three rows. Let the outside rows 
point in one direction and the middle 
row in another, each sandwich over- 
lapping the one in front of it. Let the 
brown-bread slice be uppermost in al- 
ternate sandwiches. There are two 
or three illustrated books, in which the 
subject of sandwiches is pretty thor- 
oughly treated.

Coffee was It 

People Slowly learn the Facts 

"All my life I have been such a 
slave to coffee that the very aroma of 
it was enough to set my nerves quiver- 
ing. I kept gradually losing my 
health ; but I used to say, ' Nonsense ! it 
doesn't hurt me. ' Slowly I was forced 
to admit the truth, and the final re- 
sult was that my whole nervous force 
was shattered. 

"My heart became weak and uncer- 
tain in its action, and that frightened 
me. Finally, my physician told me, 
about a year ago, that I must stop 
drinking coffee or I could never expect 
to be well again. 

"I was in despair, for the very 
thought of the medicines I had tried 
so many times nauseated me. Of 
course I thought of Postum, but could 
hardly bring myself to give up the 
coffee. Finally, I concluded that I 
owed it to myself to give Postum a 
trial. So I got a package and care- 
fully followed the directions; and what 
a delicious, nourishing, rich drink it 
was! Do you know I found it very 
easy to shift from the coffee to Postum 
and not mind the change at all ? Al- 
most immediately after I made the 
change I found myself better, and, as 
the days went by, I kept on improving. 
My nerves grew sound and steady. 
I slept well and felt strong and well 
balanced all the time. Now I am 
completely cured, with the old ner- 
vousness and sickness all gone. In 
every way I am well once more." 
Name given by Postum Company, 
Battle Creek, Mich. 

It pays to give up the drink that 
acts on some like a poison, for health 
is the greatest fortune one can have. 

"There's a reason. " 



SMES and clothes have changed and so have soda 
crackers. And yet a few people, as a matter of 
habit still buy their soda crackers in paper bags, 
in their way are as old-fashioned as the clothes of 
our ancestors. 

Progressive people— thinking people— have with their 
manner of dress, changed their methods of living. Instead 
of buying food In the open, -they prefer that which has been 
protected from dust and other things neither pleasant to 
the palate nor wholesome for the body. 

Thus they buy Uneeda Biscuit, the finest soda 
cracker the world has ever known, fn an air tight moisture 
proof package, which insures beyond question the fresh- 
ness and goodness of the contents— the price being only 5^.

Puffy Omelet with Tomato 

Beat the yolks of four eggs until 
light-colored and thick. Add one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, and four tablespoonfuls of 
water. Mix thoroughly and pour over 
the whites of three eggs, beaten dry. 
Cut and fold the mixtures together, 
and turn them into an omelet pan in 
which a tablespoonful of butter has 
been melted. Spread the mixture 
evenly over the pan. Let stand to 
become set on the bottom, then put 
into the oven. Have ready two large 
tomatoes, peeled, cut in slices, and the 
slices quartered, wring these in a 
napkin, to [press out the moisture, 
then make hot in a frying-pan in which 
is a tablespoonful of melted butter. 
Shake the pan, and make the tomato 
very hot, without burning. Season 
with salt and pepper. When a knife 
cut down into the omelet comes out 
without 2 liquid egg adhering to it, 
score the top of the omelet at right 
angles to the handle of the pan. Lay 
some of the tomato on one side, fold 
the omelet, turn onto a serving-dish, 
and pour the rest of the tomato around 
it. Select the large pieces of tomato 
from a can, and use in the same way. 



To the Roots 

Food the Cause and Another Food the Cure 

of Stomach Ails 

When sickness comes, it's best to go 
to the root of the trouble at once. 
Take away the kind of food used when 
the person got ill, for the food evidently 
didn't keep the body up. Feed the 
patient on Grape-nuts. That is the 
way of the food cure which has so 
many remarkable cases to its credit. 

"Several years ago my husband be- 
came affected by a most disagreeable 
and painful diarrhoea, lost his appetite, 
and grew shockingly thin and haggard. 
I persuaded him finally to see a physi- 
cian, but after taking a course of medi- 
cine he was worse than ever, and this 
discouraged him. So he tried a lot of 
home-made remedies, but they gave 
him only temporary relief. 

"Finally, I persuaded him to try 
another physician who treated him for 
indigestion, which, he said, was the 
cause of all his trouble; but, after sev- 
eral months' treatment, the physician 
said, 'You have let it run so long it 
has become chronic and exceedingly 
difficult to cure, and you will always 
be troubled more or less.' 

"Well, you can imagine how this 
made him feel. 

"Some time after that some friends 
advised Grape-nuts food, and he 
thought he would just give it a short 
trial. To our surprise he began to im- 
prove at once. He kept on each day 
getting better and better until now he 
can eat anything he likes, and declares 
he never felt so well in his life, has ab- 
solutely no trouble with his stomach 
or bowels, and is fleshier than he has 
been for years. Three cheers for 
Grape-nuts 1" Name given by Postum 
Company, Battle Creek, Mich. 

Sounds too easy almost to be true, 
but ten days' trial by any one will prove 
the value of Grape-nuts, the most sci- 
entific food in the world. 
"There's a reason."

Little Almond Blossom. By Jessie 

Juliet Knox. Illustrated. i2mo. 

Price $1.50. Boston: Little, Brown 

&Co. 

The writer of this volume is not en- 
tirely unknown to the readers of the 
Cooking-School Magazine. Several ar- 
ticles from her pen have appeared 
in its pages during the past year. 
Through the Chinese consul at San 
Francisco, Mrs. Knox was able to come 
in contact with and meet socially the 
better class of Chinese in the country, 
and learned much of the people that was 
interesting. A portion of this experience 
she has incorporated in her first book. 
"To me," she says, "they are a most 
interesting people. They possess the 
social spirit to the highest degree, ami- 
ability being one of the most evident 
characteristics of the people. ' ' The con - 
tents of the book are called 'Chil- 
dren's Stories"; and, though they are 
especially adapted to interest young 
children, they have in them a certain 
tone of purity and sweetness that will 
please young and old alike. Sixteen 
illustrations from photographs of Chi- 
nese children in California add much to 
the attractiveness of the volume. The 
book will be something quite new, and 
very acceptable, no doubt, to many 
children during the coming holiday 



Susan Clbgg and her Friend Mrs. 
Lathrop. By Anne Warner. Cloth, 
i6rao. Price $1. Boston : Little, 
Brown & Co. 
Several chapters of this book have 



appeared in the Century Magazine as 
separate stories during the past year, 
where they found ready and apprecia- 
tive readers. Susan Clegg is a new 
creation in humorous composition. 
Something after the style of "Mrs. Wiggs 
of the Cabbage Patch," she is a distinct 
and unique character. The book is 
funny throughout. No dull pages are 
in it. Moreover, the humor is entirely 
free from any objectionable feature. 
The reader is simply amused and 
constantly entertained by ludicrous 
circumstances and rich drollery of 
speech. 

"I guess we'd ought to make allow- 
ances f'r the minister," Susan says to 
her friend. "He ain't seemed to ever 
be able to bear up under them twins. 
He was pushin' 'em in the carriage 
to-day 'n' drawin' little Jane after him 
in a' express wagon. The minister says 
he don't thank no man to talk race- 
suicide when he's aroun'. He says his

First Lessons in Food and Diet. 
By Ellen H. Richards. 30 cents net; 
postpaid, 34 cents. Boston: Whit- 
comb & Barrows. 

This book is intended for use in 
schools and by women's clubs. It is 
arranged in a series of ten lessons, 
covering such topics as Plant Life, 
Food for the Child, the School Lun- 
cheon, What shall We Eat as a Family ? 
Daily Food, Principles on which Bills 
of Fare are Made. At the close of each 
lesson suggested "Illustrative Material" 
will be helpful to the teacher or leader 
of the class. 

Mrs. Richards is a practical chemist 
and economist. Her lessons are plain, 
scientific, and suggestive. She says: 
"The science and art of cooking com- 
bined should enable us so to prepare 
the inexpensive as to produce the most 
satisfactory flavor, texture, tempera- 
ture, and consistency, and to use the 
expensive to enhance the pleasure of 
the table just sufficiently, and not to 
the injury of the aim of all living, 



the production of the happy, healthy, 
efficient human being." 

For the uses intended this is a con- 
cise and exce'lent manual.

Housman. Cloth. i2mo. Price

Company. 

This is an interesting story, indeed. 
There is nothing shallow about the nar- 
rative. It is full of real life and well 
told. "At a very early stage," the 
writer says, "the story came to have 
for me all the interest of an experi- 
ence in real life, growing, as it were, 
out of the soil of its locality." And 
the reader feels that this is character- 
istic of the tale. 

"The chief merit of the story lies 
in the skilful delineation of character 
and the artistic descriptions of an an- 
cient village on* the seacoast of Eng- 
land, where once was a Roman camp. 
The inhabitants, men and women of 
high and low degree, are like those of 
whom Thomas Hardy writes. In the 
best sense it is a realistic story with a 
setting of remarkable interest."

ANY High School boy will write the 
above formula and glibly inform you 
that water is composed of two parts hydrogen 
and one part oxygen, but every one knows 
that with but very little water does this tell 
the whole story. 

Take a glassful from any reservoir, river, 
spring, or other water supply, subject it 
to chemical analysis, and nine times out 
of ten you will get something not far from the 
following : 

H a O, — Typhoid Germs. 
H a O, — Young Eels. 
H a O, — Decayed animal and vege- 
table matter of a thousand kinds. 

Now the ordinary person asks very little 
of the water he or she drinks. 

He wants it to look fairly clear and be 
cold in the summer-time. 

Aside* from this, the facts of the case con- 
cern him little. 

But we know, and every doctor knows, that 
many dreaded diseases have their birth in 
drinking water, and are easily traceable to 
this very source alone. 

One thing is certain : it's a good deal easier 
to get a disease germ into the system than to 
get it out. 

Write us for our booklet, telling you how, 
for a trifling expense, you can provide clear, 
clean drinking water for your entire family. 

We want you to read it carefully, for it will 
be worth while. Write to-day,

A little of thii remarkable powder sprinkled over the burning logs adda the

Single Damper I 



(patented) is the invention 
of the makers of Crawford 
Ranges. This is the greatest 
improvement ever made in 
cooking stoves and 

No Other Range Has It. 

One motion instantly regu- 
lates both fire and oven. 
Two - Damper ranges are 
difficult and confusing. 

Crawforda have more improvements than 
all other ranges combined. Improved Dock-

A Tktjb Story. — Mr. Peck had an 
enormous gas bill after he had had a 
gas stove one month. Protest to the 




gas company brought no explanation, 
so he went to the cook Bridget for an 
explanation, and opened the subject 
with, "How do you like the gas stove, 
Bridget?" "Sure, it's foine. I haven't 
had to light the stove but once since 
it came." — Christian Register.

Roast Turkey a la Javee 

The best turkey is a young, plump- 
breasted one, weighing from eight to 
twelve pounds. Should this size be 
too small to serve the expected guests, 
procure two or more of the lighter 
weight, these furnishing a larger num- 
ber of the choice tidbits or cuts which 
many prefer. 

Remove all intestines and other 
waste matter (this is usually done by 
the butcher), retaining the heart, liver, 
and outer part of the gizzard for use 
in making the giblet sauce. After re- 
moving all pin feathers, singe off all 
hairs remaining, and thoroughly wash 
the turkey by allowing cold water to 
run over and through the inside of the 
same. Hang in a -suitable place to 
drain. 

Having previously soaked in water 
enough stale bread to fill the cavity, 
press the water out of the bread until 
it is dry and crumbly. To this add 
one small onion, chopped fine, one egg, 
and pork sausage meat at the ratio of 
one ounce of meat for each pound of 
turkey. Flavor to taste with salt, 
pepper, and prepared poultry season- 
ing. This will usually furnish enough 
sage flavor. The use of too much sage 
is to be avoided, as it impairs the deli- 
cate flavor of the turkey. 

Pill the cavity, allowing plenty of 
space for the dressing to swell while 
roasting, sew up the opening, and truss 
in the usual manner. Spread melted

ld-fashioned Brownsville Water Crackers 
have a dainty, crisp deliciousness that 
is all their own. No other crackers just 
like them. 



They are baked in an old-fashioned oven, 
heated with a wood fire, which gives them a 
delicate flavor not obtainable in any other way. 



Ask your grocer for the cracker with Brownsville on it, or send ten cents 

for a sample box direct to

USE NO EGGS 
N COFFEE 

because " Koffy Setters" mate the coffee 
richer, clearer, and more appetizing. One box 
of "Koffy Setlers" at five cents saves the 
price of a dozen eggs. Your grocer should 
have them. If 




butter over all parts of the turkey, and 
dredge with flour, the butter causing 
the flour to adhere. Place breast 
down in the Javee roasting saddle, 
adjusting the saddle so that no part 
of the turkey touches the pan, fasten 
several pieces of fat pork on the back 
of the turkey with skewers (wooden 
toothpicks may be used if skewers are 
not available), and put saddle with 
turkey thus supported over the drip- 
ping-pan in a hot oven. 

In about fifteen minutes, when the 
turkey has started to brown and the 
pork to dissolve, pour about one-half 
inch of water in dripping-pan to pre- 
vent the fats from burning or adhering 
to the pan. 

Should the turkey require basting, 
the liquid in the pan may be used for 
that purpose; but a young fat turkey 
roasted in this manner usually requires 
no basting, as the juices from the back 
flow downward through and over the 
breast as the bird is roasting, causing 
the breast meat to be moist and of a 
delicious flavor. Turning the turkey 
on its back is to be avoided, as it causes 
the breast meat to be dry. Roast until 
the meat is tender to the cooking fork, 
and skin well browned. About one- 
half hour before the roasting is com- 
pleted, place in liquid in pan enough 
small pork sausages to serve as a gar- 
nish, when roasted.

Home-Making 

A New Profession 

HOME-MAKING, as now taught in some of 
the colleges, ranks as a profession as truly 
as any occupation — it is greatest in numbers and 
greatest in its effect on the individual and on society. 
" As a man's home is, such is his life." 

The basis of this new profession is Hygiene — 
at! that makes for health — personal hygiene, health- 
ful surroundings, healthful food, cooking, clothing, 
care of the sick, the right ore of children, etc. Then 
comes the Economy of Living — true economy of 
time, effort and expenditure, system of work, house- 
hold conveniences, the division of income, buying, 
household accounting, etc. Then, the Simple Life — 
living in a simple, rational, artistic way ; and — most 
important — the Children, whose health, character, 
and Gnal success in life is so largely determined by 
the home care and training. 

Every woman who would like more than tradition, 
hear-say, and scraps of information as guides in her 
life work will be interested in the Announcement of 
the American School of Household Economics which 
tells of the authoritative correspondence instruction 
and advice given by prominent teachers of the "pro- 
fession of home-making."

Sausage Potatoes. — Prepare two 
pounds of hot mashed potato, that 
has been beaten till very light, and 
half a pound of cooked sausage. Re- 
move the skin, and cut each sausage 
in two in the middle. Take up a 
spoonful of the mashed potato, lay a 
piece of sausage on it, and cover with 
a second spoonful of the potato. 
Place each one on a buttered baking- 
tin, brush with butter and beaten 
egg, and brown quickly in a hot oven. 
The potatoes should not be perfectly 
smooth, but in little irregular heaps, 
all about the same size. Serve very 
hot, with a sprig of parsley on each 
one. 

Sausage Croquettes. — Cut up some 
cold cooked sausage meat, and stir in 
some hot mashed potato, which can 
be heated for the purpose, if there is 
any at hand left over from a previous 
meal. Mix with a beaten egg, to hold 
the mixture together, form into cro- 
quettes, dip in egg, and roll in bread 
crumbs, and fry in deep fat in a wire 
basket. Serve very hot.

The Feast of Saint Nicholas as Observed in 

Holland. With some of the Dainties 

Peculiar to the Season 

By Anna Pitt Walls 

THE 6th of December, the 
day dedicated to Saint Nich- 
olas, is celebrated in Holland 
in much the same manner as the 25th, 
or Christmas Day, is with us. 

From the appearance of the milk- 
cart at early dawn until the last pres- 
ent is unwrapped at night all is ex- 
citement. A milk-wagon is drawn by 
a dog; and, if too heavy for him to 
pull, the milk-woman harnesses her- 
self to the shaft, and together they 
go from house to house. On St. Nich- 
olas Day there is always something 
for the woman in the empty can, and 
the dog is also remembered. As be 
cannot eat all the bones given him, 

they are wrapped up and put in the 

cart, for future occasions. 

In the evening a large sheet is spread 
on tbe floor, and the children stand 
around it, waiting for the appearance 
of the saint, singing songs of welcome 
and asking him to be generous. At 
the appointed time one of the elders, 
disguised as Saint Nicholas, in a 
"beste tabbard" and full Episcopal 
robes, enters, laden with presents. 
A servant stands behind him with an 
open bag in one hand, to put naughty 



boys and girls in, and a switch in the 
other. 

The "beste tabbard" is supposed 
to carry him over the roofs of the 
houses, as the reindeers carry our Santa 
Claus. 

The presents are wrapped in many 
papers, sometimes hidden in a loaf 
of boren mik, a loaf of brown bread 
with raisins in it; and the longer it 
takes to find the various gifts, and the 



234 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



more mystery there is, the greater the 
enjoyment. 

Sometimes different names are on 
the different wrappers, so until the 



A Dutch Kitchen 

last one is unfolded there is a doubt 
as to who will be the recipient. After 
the children have opened and admired 
their gifts, repeated their verses and 
retired, the older people gather around 
the table, waiting in turn for their 
surprises. They are brought in by 
servants, two or three at a time, 
wrapped in the same manner as those 
for the little ones. 

' ' Letterblankets, " or cakes baked 
in the shape of letters, hot chocolate, 
and boiled chestnuts are passed around 
as refreshments. The young men and 
maidens give each other marshpein, 
baked in the shape of a heart, and 
vryer, a cake in the form of a man or 



i, as the case may be, with strips 
of gold paper pasted across them. 

They also have honey koeks at 
this time. 

One of the favorite dishes 
in Holland is jugged pigeons. 
I give the recipe for them and 
some of the other dainties, 
dear to this nation, below. 

If there is snow on the 
ground on this festival, it is 
regarded as a good omen; for 
then all is white and clean, 
and the Hollander dearly 
loves cleanliness. 

Jugged pigeon is particu- 
larly a favorite dish in the 
older villages, where the cook- 
ing is done over the open fire 
or on a spit before it. In 
the cities and large towns the 
old ways have given place to 
the new, but in the villages 
and farms the inhabitants 
are content to follow the ex- 
ample set by their forefathers. 
Even in the poorest houses an 
air of extreme cleanliness pre- 
vails. The cooking utensils 
are mostly of copper or brass, 
handed down from mother 
to daughter for generations. 
They are polished till one 
can see the face in them. And there is 
always a plentiful supply. 

The blue china is ranged on a high 
shelf surrounding the room, giv- 
ing a picturesque appearance, which, 
added to the cleanliness, make these 
houses, often of only one room, attrac- 
tive. 

Cauliflower and cabbage and most 
of the vegetables are flavored with 
spices.

Fashion in Art 

By Judith Giddings 



IN our first busy century, Americans 
had little time for the foundation of 
a national style in any of the fine 
arts. They were too busy conquering 
the rude forces of an unknown world 
to devote their energies to anything 
save the development of natural re- 
sources, and the arts and crafts of the 
mother country for a long time suf- 
ficed for useful and decorative purposes. 
Men plied homely trades, dealing with 
the necessities of living; and it was not 
until late in the eighteenth century 
that gold and silver smiths found a 
foothold in severe New England. 
Those of us who can trace our heir- 
looms sufficiently far back into the 
mysterious past can safely presume 
upon their English origin. 

The silver ware here pictured has 
been over a hundred years in use, and 
is still in perfect condition. Exact and 
complete information regarding it is 
unfortunately unobtainable; but it is 



said to have been brought over from 
England for an officer in the Revolu- 
tionary War. This old soldier, though 
not a man of great wealth, yet lived in 
considerable state for the small New 
England town of his nativity. His 
portrait, as well as these evidences of 
his taste, would denote that he was, 
indeed, alive to the good things of his 
time; for his double chin and florid 
countenance bespeak good and hearty 
living, and the various accessories of 
his table are to-day among the chief 
treasures of his descendants. 

The sugar-bowl and cream-jug are 
large and ample, and their dignity and 
simplicity are clearly manifest by com- 
parison with the highly ornate designs 
of a quarter of a century ago. The cake 
baskets of open silver wire, resting 
upon four balls at the base, are plain 
and graceful; while the salver, of a 
somewhat later date, is liberally chased. 

That happy hostess who can set 



Games and Amusements of Japanese Children 



*39 



her table with her great-grandfather's 
plate is thrice blessed, — namely, with 
simplicity of design, conscientious work- 
manship, and the halo of romance ; 
for, who shall say that the sugar is not 
sweeter, the cream richer, the cake and 
wine more tempting from these relics 
of a courtly past, which breathe of the 
time when Lucinda, in flowered dim- 
ity, passed spice cake and wine to the 
minister in the dim parlor, and Melinda 
washed the cups and counted the tea- 
spoons! Indeed, the hostess is for- 
given her touch of pride, for the two 
P*s — plate and portraits — come down 
the decades with gratifying surety of 
old-time pomp, pride, and prosperity. 
And fortunate the woman who can call 
them her own; for in a century's time 
what may not befall these treasures? 
Change of place, of circumstance, a 
vandal hand, a crash of fortune, and 
they fall into unknown paths or the 
second-hand shop, to be picked up by 
strangers. 

Just what melancholy fate overtook 
the teapot, which we cannot but feel 
should accompany this bowl and 
pitcher, is a matter of unchronicled 
history and sad family conjecture; for 



it is hardly to be supposed that a 
household possessed of such a service 
would be without its teapot at a time 
when tea was a coveted luxury and 
teapots were in common use. 

That our common usages were once 
luxuries is clearly demonstrated by a 
look back to that economical day when 
"the lady of the house placed the tea 
leaves on a silver strainer, after the 
very last drop had been exhausted, 
that they might be hospitably divided 
amongst the company to be eaten with 
sugar and with bread and butter." 

To-day art and the appreciation of 
art are making rapid strides forward, 
yet backward to the greater simplicity 
of our forefathers. It is a long step 
across the centuries to the bargain 
counter of the present day; and to all 
lovers of the truly beautiful it is grati- 
fying to learn that the tide of thin 
cheap silver, with which the market 
has been overflowing in recent years, 
has received a check from Fashion's 
hand. For it has of necessity depre- 
ciated the material and sentimental 
value of silver products, save in the 
case of really valuable articles, which 
create and sustain values in all times. 



Games and Amusements of Japanese 

Children 

By Jessie Juliet Knox 



THE games and amusements 
of a Japanese child are varied 
and strange, and so promi- 
nent a place in their lives do these 
things take that to learn the rules of 
their different games is a legitimate 
part of their education. Not only do 
the children play these games, but 



their elders, also, participate, and enter 
into every detail of child life with the 
greatest interest. 

Some of the games are of national 
character, and in these all classes in- 
dulge. Games for the little girls are 
very beautiful to look upon, on account 
of the gorgeous attire of these little 



24° 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



Mikado maids. One very popular game, 
and one almost always in prog- 
ress, is called "bouncing the ball." 
It has often seemed that this might 
better be called "bouncing the baby"; 
for, as they almost invariably have the 
latter commodity strapped to their 
lithe little backs, it really happens 
that the baby gets most of the bounc- 
ing. 

The girls are very picturesque, as, 
with powdered faces, painted Ups, at- 
tractive coiffures, and gay robes, they 
joyfully enter into the different games, 
delighting the artistic sense of the 
foreigner. One game is battledore 
and shuttlecock. They play in cir- 
cles, as well as in twos and threes. 
The shuttlecock is a gilded seed, with 
feathers fastened around it, resem- 
bling the petals of a flower. The battle- 
dore is a wooden bat. This game is 
a popular one with girls, as it gives 
them such a good opportunity of dis- 
playing dress and beauty. The 
penalty of failure in this game is to 
have the face marked with ink. The 
boys sing, meanwhile, and ask that 
the wind may blow, and the girls sing 
that it may be calm, so that their shut- 
tlecocks may fly straight. 

Checkers and backgammon are also 
popular, and in February and March 
kite-flying is extensively indulged in 
by young and old. This is with them, 
as well as the Chinese, a national game. 

Much pleasure is derived from me- 
chanical toys worked by water wheels; 
and boys will, also, harness eight 
beetles to a paper cart, and mike 
them pull a load of rice uphill. They 
have bamboo cages for the imprison- 
ment of katydids, or cicadas; and bright 
butterflies are sometimes kept in tiny 
cages on beds of flowers. 



protection from evil. The part of 
pussy is taken by a child who is covered 
with a dark cloth. 

"Genji Heike" was an old Japa- 
nese game in which the boys stood in 
a row, representing a certain clan. 
The Genjis used white flags, and the 
Heikes red ones. At a certain signal 
the lines would advance, and try to 
capture each other's flags. Then fol- 
lowed a great struggle, and the side 
that captured the greatest number 
of flags was victorious. 

There is another game which is very 
instructive, and causes one to marvel 
at the agility displayed by Japanese 
children in naming the different post 
stations. For six sen may be ob- 
tained the game by which all this is 
learned. It consists of very small 
blocks and dice. On a board are 
placed the names and pictures of the 
different post stations, with the num- 
ber of miles between each and the next 
one printed beneath. To reach Kioto 
at the further end of the board is a 
consummation devoutly to be wished, 
for more than one reason; for at Kioto 
is an appetizing array of sweetened 
rice cakes, which are awarded to the 
player who first reaches them. 

In the sleeves of Japanese children 
may nearly always be found a pack of 
playing cards. The games played with 
these are very instructive. One of 
these is "One hundred verses of one 
hundred poets," and much is learned 
from dealing, drawing, reading, and 
guessing. All their games are for the 
purpose of teaching something. Some 
teach geography, some history, others 
obedience, unselfishness, and scorn of 
pain. 

Many are the books for the delec- 
tation of Japanese children; and these 



One of their games is similar to "puss\ may be found at the toy bazaar, or

their whole lives to the entertainment 
of Japanese wee ones. Both children 
and monkeys are trained to act in 
these street theatres; and the monkeys 
attired in gay kimonos are, indeed, a 
sight to make any one laugh, even if 
they have passed childish years. 

There is dancing, and sometimes 
good stories, even, by the man who 
peddles sugared peas, candied beans, 
starch patties, shiruko, and sushi (a 
sweet cake plastered over with vine- 
gar, fish, and seaweed). He also beats 
a drum and sings, all of which is an 
added delight to these pleasure-loving 
tots. 

Sometimes a great pleasure comes 
into their lives, in the shape of an old 
woman, who carries an outfit for the 
concoction of the most delightful 
griddle-cakes. She will rent this at 
reasonable rates to anv child who 
wishes it; and the stirring, ladling, 
and baking is indeed an important 
and thoroughly satisfactory under- 
taking. These are spread with soy, 
the popular and omnipresent Japa- 
nese sauce. 

Frequent are the visits to the theatre, 
where the child usually remains all day. 
Here he sits on the floor, by his side 
his lacquered box of sweets and jar of 
rice. The ushers serve hot tea, which 
the Japanese drink instead of water. 
All the emotions which are portrayed 
by the actors are to be seen reflected 
in the faces of the Japanese children; 
and tragedy and comedy alternate 
swiftly thereon, making it a most 
amusing study for a foreigner. 

Also the visits to the temples are 
bright spots in these little lives, for 
it is not as if they had to sit quietly 
here, and listen to a prosy sermon. 
Instead, after a momentary recogni- 
tion of the gods, they are allowed to 
go out on the green grass, and roll 
about in the cool shade of the crypto- 
meria trees and feed the fishes in the 
lake. 



The flower feasts are eagerly looked 
forward to by the children; for they 
have a great love of flowers, the artis- 
tic arrangement of which is a part of 
their education. 

There is the feast of the cherry in 
April, the wistaria in June, the lotus 
in August, and the chrysanthemum 
in November. The schoolmasters take 
the children for frequent walks, point- 
ing out to them the beauties of na- 
ture, and frequently refreshing them 
with tea and other dainties served 
at the different tea-houses. 

The little girls of Japan are very 
happy once a year; for then comes the 
"Hina Matsuri," or feast of dolls. 
The whole of this delightful day is 
given up to the girls; and there are 
gayeties of all kinds, in which dolls 
play the most prominent part. There 
are doll breakfasts, doll dinners, and 
doll tableaux. Each tiny girl, who 
takes part in the tableaux, has a doll 
fastened to her back. No boys are 
allowed to come to the feast, and at 
this time they feel very much neg- 
lected. However, they find a great 
consolation in the fact that their time 
will soon come, as it does, on the fifth 
day of the fifth month. This is the 
annual holiday for boys, and is in 
honor of the god of war. Now the 
flags fly everywhere, and countless 
are the tops and animal toys to be 
found in the toy-shops. 

The greatest of the children's festi- 
vals is the Japanese New Year, which 
lasts three days. At this time the 
"mochi man" takes the place of Santa 
Claus; and his rice cakes, sweet and 
glutinous, are eagerly looked for by 
all the little Japs. At this time, all 
the children are allowed to accom- 
pany the parents, in making New 
Year's calls; and they enjoy this im- 
mensely, as they receive so much at- 
tention and are the recipients of so 
many sweets. 

The swimming festival, or festival 



24-2 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



of Tanabata, is most delightful ; for at 
this time boys may go in swimming 
without fear of the dread monster, or 
sea-monkey, who is handcuffed for 
this special occasion. At any other 
time he is free to stretch out his body 
and draw under the waves all those 
boys who swim without permission 
of their parents. 

In Japan there are many children's 
parties. At these all the girls look 
like gayly-dressed dolls. When all 
have arrived, the little hostess and 
her mother prostrate themselves before 
each guest, presenting tea and sweets 
on lacquered trays, and after that 
very quiet and polite games are 
played until dusk. Many and most 
amusing are the games played on these 
occasions. 

The game of iroha garuta is played 
by every child in Japan. Small cards 
are used in this game, each one con- 



taining a proverb, while on another is 
a picture to illustrate it. Each prov- 
erb begins with a letter. The cards 
are shuffled and dealt, and one of the 
children is the reader. When he reads 
a proverb from his card, the child who 
has the picture corresponding to that 
one calls it out. The winner is the first 
one who gets rid of his cards, and the 
one who has the last card wins the 
game. Although it is played with 
great animation and very rapidly, yet 
the most amusing courtesy is shown 
throughout. If a girl loses, she has a 
bunch of straw placed in her hair; and, 
if the loser be a boy, he has ink-marks 
made around his eyes. But, with all 
the time given to amusement by these 
little ones of Mikado land, it does not 
serve to spoil them, strangely enough; 
but, on the contrary, no children in the 
world are more courteous, obedient, 
and respectful than they. 



Christmas Real Estate 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



« 




T is almost Christmas," observed 
Mrs. Fox, in casual tone. 

"I know it," replied her hus- 
band, abjectly; "but I cannot decide 
what to give, you. The last anniversary 
gifts have not seemed to suit*" 

4 'Oh, yes, they did; but, supposing 
we do not give each other anything, 
only join in a gift to the house, some- 
thing that ethically is advisable, but 
not necessary from a financial point 
of view." 

"You talk as if you had been to 
your club. I am tired of ethical values. 
I want you and me to be jolly." 

"Well, we can be if we make others 
so, and" — 

"Bother your club ideas!" 



"Joe, don't be so previous. I want 
to alter over the lower part of the 
house as a Christmas gift to our real 
estate. We could do it together out 
of our separate savings. Our maids 
ought to have a parlor of their own. 
It is demoralizing to spend one's even- 
ings where one has been working morn- 
ings." 

"They don't care," interrupted Mr. 
Fox. 

"But they do care. Lizzy Ann said 
to-day that she would be tickled to 
live where there was a maid's parlor. 
You see girls are in such close quarters 
with each other, with no rooms of their 
own, only trunks, that there is con- 
stant friction and no refining or sooth-

ing influences lying round. Girls have 
their temperaments just as we have." 

"I thought you had fixed up their 
dining table and all that sort of thing." 

"I have; but it is all in the same 
place, — working, eating, sewing, noth- 
ing to suggest leisure and callers and 
doing as you like. I want them to 
have card parties and candy scrapes. 
It won't cost much." And Mrs. Fox 
produced her memoranda and plans, 
much to her husband's amusement, 
who rather enjoyed his wife's finan- 
ciering; for she had contrived out of 
a small income and a small house to 
produce good effects and to provide a 
"den" for his exclusive use. 

Yet he remonstrated as she explained 
her plans, careful though she was to 
make it clear that the defects of mod- 
ern houses were due to heartless archi- 
tects, and not to callous husbands. 
Moreover, she did not fritter away his 
self-respect by flattering or caressing 
him, but treated him as if he were a 
reasonable ruler, to whose infallible 
judgment she humbly submitted a 
certain measure. All the same, she 
had taken care to look her very best 
in a gown he liked. Gradually he grew 
interested in her scheme, not on ethi- 
cal grounds, but on those of self-in- 
terest, thinking how much better his 
dinners might be seasoned if the cook 
could escape temporarily from kitchen 
odors, and how much quicker the table 
might be waited upon if the second girl 
knew her young man was coming to 
call upon her in a pretty parlor, and 
how much the value of his house by 
this arrangement would be increased 
in case he wanted to sell. It only 
needed one or two partitions, Jthe 
changing of a window, and an altera- 
tion in the turn of the lower staircase, 
to give the maids a pleasant parlor, 
fronting the street; and to such new 
room could be conveyed the unde- 
sirable furniture, rugs, and bric-a-brac 
now in use elsewhere. Then it could 



easily be done if no Christmas presents 
were exchanged between Mr. and Mrs. 
Fox for two years to come, as both 
were adepts in a double-ledger system 
of housekeeping, by which they al- 
ways knew a year ahead how much 
it was going to cost them to live, and 
yet contrived to save up something. 

"Perhaps it is lucky we have no 
children to be deprived of their Christ- 
mas stockings and trees by the carrying 
out of your plan," said Mr. Fox, ten- 
tatively. 

"If we had," replied his wife, "the 
• maids would enjoy their own parlor 
all the more; but, as we haven't, I 
want to do what I can to make them 
happy. Sometimes I think, if I only 
had a dog to follow me round, I might 
not think so much about their good 
times." 

Her husband looked at her curiously, 
but merely remarked it was time for 
him to go to his club. Yet, when 
there, he pondered on her inscrutable- 
ness (for he had somewhat supposed 
that her good housekeeping instincts 
were against dogs) and a wish which 
long had been brooding in his heart. 

Mrs. Fox did not allude again to the 
proposed parlor, but neither did she 
provide herself with a Christmas pres- 
ent for Mr. Fox. She awaited develop- 
ments, and studied carpenter's plans 
for the basement. Still, when the day 
came, she was fearful, as the creation 
of this new room had assumed to her 
the dimensions of a duty which must 
be performed at any cost save that 
of divorce. She put her accumulated 
savings in a box labelled " For improve- 
ment in real estate," and had it ready 
to give her husband in case he was 
complaisant. 

When the time was at hand, they 
wished each other Merry Christmas, 
but hung up no wreaths, and there 
were no bundles to send away. A 
few came in, but were left unopened. 
Mrs. Fox felt as if her heart were 



*44

breaking, and Mr. Fox was fidgety. 
But, after the maids had gone off for 
the day, leaving her to dish the dinner, 
her anxiety got the better of her pride, 
and she timidly offered her husband 
the box. 

"Why! you should not have both- 
ered so," he said as he provokingly 
counted its contents. "A man ought 
to look after his own real estate." 

She flushed at his joking tone, but 
did not cry. Proud of her self-control 
and her indignant beauty, he suddenly 
pulled out of his vest pocket a check 
made out to her, saying: "I guess that • 
will fix it. Give the girls their parlor. 
You are all right about it. You must 
not mind a little Christmas teasing, 
especially as you have not given any- 
thing to me, myself." 
f - "Neither have you given me any- 
thing," she laughed back delightedly. 

And then the bell rang, and her 
husband hurried past her to open the 
door; and there were voices and a pat- 
tering of feet, and a tiny dog, all white 
and fluffy (with her name on its collar) 
and bounding with life, rushed upstairs. 
She caught him in her arms, and, for- 
getting her reserve, called him hers, to 
love and to pet, to have and to hold 
as her daily companion. 

Mr. Fox watched her, still fidgeting. 
Again the bell rang, and she heard her 
husband telling some one to go away, 



and that it was all right. And then, 
in uncertain manner, he led a wee bov 
to her, asking: "Don't you want him, 
too? I can't stand any more Christ- 
mases without children and dogs." 

The boy and the dog were evidently 
such old friends that neither paid any 
attention to her. "What does it 
mean?" she inquired nervously. 

"Just what you choose to make it," 
he answered. "He is borrowed for the 
day or he can stay always. I got him 
for you out of the home in case you 
wanted him. He is all right as to 
heredity. If the maids are to have a 
parlor, we ought to have a nursery. 
That's all, but just as you like." 

"Why, it is the most beautiful thing 
in the world to have a dog and a 
boy. I don't know which to like best. 
I always wanted one or the other, or 
both." 

"Why didn't you say so then? I 
had to guess at it all." 

"You have given me three Christ- 
mas gifts to-day!" replied Mrs. Fox, 
apologetically, as she had not given 
him even one. 

"No, I haven't. The check is for 
real estate improvements, the dog is 
for the boy, and the boy is to be — my 
heir." But he bent down to kiss her 
with a look which told her that she, in 
her new-found happiness, was his best 
Christmas present. 



A Culprit 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 



i< 



I spilled some water on the cloth 

At breakfast-time to-day, 
And mamma said, 'You go straight now 

And in my bedroom stay.' 



"I didn't have enough to eat! 
There's no fun here at all! 
And maybe she won't let me know 
If Bobby comes to call. 



' 'The minister was here to tea, 
And hit and tipped his cup; 
He looked real scared, but mamma said 
'No harm. I'll wipe it up!' 

"It made a big stain on the cloth, 
As plain a$ plain could be. 
I wonder why, when water's spilled. 
It's so much worse than tea!" 



Breakfast in the Bon Marche 

By Helen Campbell 



IT was under special circumstances 
— a special permit, indeed — that 
this breakfast was not eaten, but 
observed, the process going on for two 
hundred at once, other two hundred 
taking their places at the end of the 
allotted half-hour. Not before had 
outsiders been admitted, nor are they 
now, unless the rules have been altered 
recently; but the opportunity came 
at nearly the end of a long investiga- 
tion into the working conditions for 
women and children in trades in Paris, 
especially in every phase of the manu- 
facture and sale of clothing. To get 
at the truth had been almost impos- 
sible, since there is no practical free- 
dom of entrance, as in the United 
States and, in less degree, in England; 
and, though letters of a nature that 
could not be disregarded had opened 
a good many doors at first disposed 
to remain closed, the way had at no 
time been an easy one. But some- 
thing of the spirit of the hard-work- 
ing, kind, old founder was in all her 
hands had labored to bring into shape, 
and an interest, which had a certain 
right to gratification, was here taken 
for granted to be, in degree at least, 
legitimate. So whatever red tape was 
still to be encountered was cut, and 
the doors swung wide to one of the first 
restaurants for employees ever pro- 
vided by the employer. 

This was more than ten years ago; 
and the immense establishment has 
continued to grow, and, in fact, to 
carry out the last wishes and original 
intention of its founder. The number 
of employees has increased steadily, 
but the same general conditions still 
prevail. The women have a home 
and a life of their own in another build- 
ing somewhat removed from the cen- 



tral one; but the men take meals in 
rooms designed for this purpose with 
perfectly appointed kitchens opening 
from them. And, as my guide had 
already found that I wanted every 
detail, he smilingly produced the head 
cook; and I saw the dijeuner a la 
fourchette from its incipiency to its ful- 
filment. 

This morning it proved to be beef- 
steak and "French fried potatoes," 
as we call them, the beef being cut and 
pounded into shapes as large as the 
palm of a man's hand, and nearly half 
an inch thick. 

The potatoes were nearly ready, the 
cook's assistants paring and cutting 
them into pieces as even in size as if 
done by machinery, and throwing 
them into great pans of cold water, 
from which they were presently taken 
and drained, then placed in wire bas- 
kets in great pans of boiling lard, and 
watched to the instant of perfect 
browning by the white-capped cooks. 
In the mean time over countless char- 
coal fires two hundred steaks were 
broiling, and, as the clerks filed in 
(some of them singing and all with a 
look as if enjoyment were not only 
ahead, but had a home there), hot 
plates received a portion, with one of 
the potatoes, and the whole table 
was served in an incredibly short space 
of time. A bottle of vin ordinaire was 
at every plate, and what seemed to 
be a full yard of crisp French bread. 

To the American, gazing from a 
hidden vantage-point, the extraordi- 
nary feature was the sense of leisure 
and enjoyment. In a certain famous 
restaurant in New York — famous as 
the most popular business men's re- 
sort — no one chatted or smiled or re- 
garded his neighbor, it seemed, as any- 



246 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



thing but a barrier to his being first 
served. The noonday lunch was swal- 
lowed, often, in five minutes, he who 
took fifteen being regarded as a man 
who had lost his senses for the time 
and would be sorry for it all the after- 
noon. 

Here, on the contrary, less than half 
an hour would have been considered 
an insult to all concerned. Men ate 
slowly and comfortably. Jests went 
round, and laughs were heard. Now 
and then a hungry one demanded even 
a third portion, and, though jeered 
at, received it; while without, in the 
spotless kitchens, another relay was 
being prepared; and on the minute 
the first detachment filed out the tables 
were ready, and within ten minutes 
filled again. There were the precision 
and certainty of military drill. No 
over-haste, no waste of any order, all 
trimmings going into great soup-di- 
gesters, and the kitchen appearing 
with as little hint of confusion or dis- 
order as a Shaker's. Fed after this 
fashion, small wonder is it that dys- 
pepsia is seldom encountered, and the 
necessity for the myriad forms of pa- 
tent medicine, designed to relieve or 
banish the fiend, is totally unknown. 
The light acid of good vin ordinaire is 
surety against difficulties with the 
liver, and the addition of a small plate 
of fruit in its season clinches the mat- 
ter. And yet the hours are long, work 
is exacting, and the ventilation usu- 
ally is bad, — a point seldom regarded 
by J!he French employer. Is it by any 
employer, save the very occasional one 
who has come to a sense of what pure 
air means? The Bon March£ did not 
concern itself with what its employees 
breathed, but it did most thoroughly, 
with how they were fed ; and the mem- 
ory of the comfortable, satisfied look 
on the faces of those men, chiefly young 
ones, is still a pleasant memory. 

The head cook, questioned as to 
tastes, said small beefsteaks were most 



in favor, but cutlets also were popular, 
chops less so, and ragouts, such ^s he 
conceived and executed, could never 
be supplied in sufficient quantity. He 
smacked his lips, but with discretion, 
as he spoke, and lifted a lid under 
which simmered a combination, as far 
removed from what the profane might 
call a beef stew as a fatted capon from 
an aged hen just put into the pot. It 
was no question of miscellaneous odds 
and ends, — for all trimmings were al- 
ready in the digesters, — but a balanced 
scheme of meat and vegetable enough 
for flavor and a sauce of its own prop- 
erly thickened juices that would tempt 
an anchorite. I know, though not 
an anchorite; for my own dijeuner 
needed attention, and received it. 

Employers in this country are be- 
ginning to consider this matter, and 
at a few points in one city or another 
the experiment is being tried. In 
Dayton, Ohio, both a carefully pre- 
pared lunch and full time for its en- 
joyment are given by the National 
Cash Register Company, and the added 
health and comfort of the employees 
is the best testimony to its value. The 
Institute of Technology has its own 
lunch-room, supplied by the New 
England Kitchen; and among the 
great department stores Filene's is 
one of the best examples of intelli- 
gent handling of the whole matter, 
full time and an excellent menu being 
given daily. We shall in good time 
have learned how to eat; and, when 
that good day arrives, the day of the 
patent medicine man ends once for 
all. Our yearly thousands of tons of 
pills and innumerable other thou- 
sands of hogsheads of bitters and tonics 
and sarsaparillas will go to feed the 
fishes, or cease to exist at all, the last 
most advisable, since the fish has his 
own rights and might well protest, 
were Atlantic or Pacific made dump- 
ing-ground for either pills, powders, 
or bottles of any order of contents. 



Our Ancestors' Plum Pudding 

By T. Celestine Cummings 

"^TTE'LL crown the plum pudding 
VV With bunches of bay 
And roast all the chestnuts 
That come in our way." 



OUR British ancestors were very 
fond of plum pudding, and it 
is always as closely associated 
with Christmas as are the holly and 
mistletoe. So universal is the custom 
of eating plum pudding on that one day 
that charitable societies distribute it, 
and it is served even in the prisons. 
Of course, in dispensing the pudding in 
this way, huge ones must be provided. 
An old charter in the village of Paignton 
in Devonshire provides for an immense 
plum pudding every "fiftieth" Christ- 
mas, to feed the poor. You can imagine 
that the occasion is always a great one, 
and long looked forward to, as it is 
the good fortune of the villagers to 
participate in this feast only once in a 
lifetime, perhaps. 

Here are the proportions, for one of 
these monster puddings, of the in- 
gredients used: a bushel of eggs, one 
hundred and twenty pounds of suet, a 
like weight of raisins, and five hundred 
pounds of flour, with a liberal amount 
of spices. The pudding weighed "nine 
hundred pounds," and required a good 
deal of boiling. A large brewing cop- 
per was used for this purpose. It was 
kept on a steady boil day and night 
from Saturday morning to Tuesday 
evening; and even then, unfortunately, 
was not cooked enough, as they found 
out when they reached the heart of the 
pudding. It was impossible for the 
heat to penetrate through such bulk. 
So, profiting by this experience, the 
next large one was divided into sec- 
tions, and placed together as a whole 
after being cooked. 
This second monster pudding was 



served on Christmas Day of 1858 in 
the same village. It was to celebrate 
another special event, aside from that 
of the holiday, as Paignton had been 
connected by a railroad, just finished 
the week before, that united them with 
civilization. Therefore, it was a very 
great event to the villagers. The 
preparations for this pudding cost 
$225, and the ingredients considerably 
more. Bread crumbs, lemons, milk, 
and sugar were used, making the pud- 
ding so much the richer. This colossal 
affair weighed nearly a ton ; and eight 
horses, decked out with holly and 
mistletoe, were required to remove it 
to the village green, where it was 
placed symmetrically together to form 
one pudding. Thousands of people 
were there; and they were not, some of 
them, very well behaved, as the record 
states. Soon as the carver commenced 
to cut into the. pudding, the crcvd 
made a rush for it, even breaking 
down fences in their eagerness to reach 
a portion of it, until not a scrap re- 
mained. 

A few years later a large pudding 
made in Southwark, then a suburb of 
London, was carried through the 
streets in procession, headed by a band 
which played alternately Christmas 
music and popular airs. We hear of 
another monster pudding served at a 
church fair as a special attraction. 

In some parts of England the pud- 
ding served on Christmas Day is a year 
old, the "good wife" making several 
at a time while she is about it. If 
a genuine English pudding is boiled 
long enough, it grows richer with age.

Hence the custom. It can be cared 
for until wanted, as you would cafe 
for fruit cake, by packing it in granu- 
lated sugar. A loaf of wedding cake 
was put away six years ago in a tin 
receptacle just large enough for the 
cake, and an inch of sugar all around 
it. The box was wrapped in heavy 
brown paper, and placed in the attic. 
The flavor of the cake and of a pudding 
packed away two years ago were just 
as fine as on the day they were 
made. 

Some of the English housewives boil 
their puddings twenty-four hours, and 
then let them cqol. When one is 
wanted, it is boiled by itself from four 
to six hours longer before being served. 

There is no doubt that this historic 
pudding had a. humble origin, being, 
in fact, a successor to the "plum- 
pudding porridge' ' of ye olden times. 
A tried recipe in our family, a hundred 
years old, gives good results every 
time it is used. One pound of beef 
suet, shredded fine and chopped, one 
pound of seeded raisins, the same 
amount of currants, carefully washed 
and dried, half a pound of citron in 
fine shavings, five tablespoonfuls of 
brown sugar, rolled fine, three cups of 
grated stale bread, one cup of flour, 
one grated nutmeg, a tablespoonful, 
each, of mace and cinnamon, four large 
tablespoonfuls of cream, and six eggs. 



The recipe calls for brandy of wine, 
but two gills of orange juice can be 
substituted, if preferred, and the rind 
of a lemon. Roll the fruit in the flour, 
moisten the bread crumbs with the 
cream, beat up the yolks of the eggs, 
and stir into them all the ingredients, 
and, lastly, the whipped whites of the 
eggs. Pour into a pudding bag, leav- 
ing room for it to swell. 

If you wish the pudding to look 
genuinely English, it must be perfectly 
round and show the creases of being 
boiled in a cloth. Use for the bag a 
square piece of drilling. Dip it in 
boiling water, then rub flour on the 
outside. This forms a crust on the 
cloth which the water or steam cannot 
soak through. The pudding is now 
placed in an enamelled bowl, and cov- 
ered with paraffin paper, and the cloth 
is gathered up loosely at the four cor- 
ners and tied, one-quarter space being 
allowed for the pudding to swell. Six 
hours' time is required for a steady 
boiling. If the water ceases boiling

A Dream of Home 

By Lucia W. Eames 



A shelter safe, when tempests blow, 
From icy blast and drifting snow; 
Or, in the summer's noontide heat. 
A shady place, a cool retreat; 
A bit of God's earth hedged about 
To shut dark hate and envy out; 
A space where tired feet may rest, 
And weary brain with care oppressed 



Find sweet relief in quietness; 
Where tenderness soothes sorrow's smart, 
And brave words cheer the fainting heart; 
A place where love, unfettered, free. 
May find its full satiety, 
And thoughts and words and acts com- 
bine 
To mirror harmonies divine.

Gelatine 

Production of Gelatine, and Constitu- 
ents of Bone 
i. Two meat bones ("breaker" bones 
from forequarter of lamb) A and B. 
Place A over fire of clear, red coals until 
incandescent. 

2. Place B in weak solution of HC1 
(30 cc, or two tablespoonfuls, HC1, in 
one cup of water) for two or three days. 
Compare with A. Keep the solution 
obtained. 

3. Treat a tendon in same manner 
as B. Compare with tendon not so 
treated. 

4. Wash bone and tendon from 2 
and 3 in clear water, then in a solution 
of sodium carbonate. Boil each for 
thirty minutes in one-half cup of water, 
keeping up the quantity of water. 
Strain liquid through cheese-cloth, test 
with litmus. If acid, neutralize with 
sodium carbonate. Set aside to cool. 

5. Dissolve a little of the powdered 
bone ash from 1 A in hydrochloric acid. 
Filter, and add ammonium oxalate 
to filtrate. 

6. Test solution from 2 with ammo- 
nium oxalate. 

Study of Gelatine in Cooking 
Effect of Water, Heat, Acid, and Man- 
ipulation 

1. Measure three teaspoonfuls gran- 
ulated gelatine. Add two tablespoon- 
fuls cold water. Mix, and allow to 
stand five minutes. 

2. Add one-half cup boiling water, 
in which two tablespoonfuls sugar 
have been dissolved. Mix well. 

3. Divide into two parts, A and B. 
To A add two tablespoonfuls coffee 



extract, to B two tablespoonfuls lemon 
juice. Strain into glasses, and set 
away to cool. Which is the stiff er? 

4. One teaspoonful gelatine and one 
tablespoonful cold water. Let stand 
five minutes, and add two table- 
spoonfuls boiling water. Mix as be- 
fore. Add one tablespoonful straw- 
berry or other preserved fruit. Set 
away to cool, and, when beginning to 
harden, beat with Dover beater until 
stiff. Can be placed in either glass 
A or B. 

To make Coffee Extract 
Beat one egg in one cup of cold 
water. Add one cup of medium 
ground coffee, and mix. Add mixt- 
ure to four cups of boiling water, 
boil five minutes, and strain through 
cheese-cloth, or let drip through a 
jelly-bag. 

Comparison of Commercial Gel- 
atine 

Four of the commonest commercial 
varieties of gelatine are procured for 
class study. The class is divided into 
four groups, the students comprising 
each group studying the character- 
istics of one variety of gelatine, while 
making from it four kinds of jelly; 
namely, milk, lemon, orange, and cof- 
fee. Finally, the work of the four 
groups is compared, a table is formed, 
and filled out under the following 
heads: name, of commercial variety; 
description, whether granulated, shred- 
ded, etc. ; price per box; volume in 
box; yield in jelly; characteristics, — 
e.g., easy or difficult of hydration; 
completely or partially soluble; pos-

sessing or not an acid reaction (if acid, 
milk jelly will curdle) ; yielding a 
dear or a dull jelly; possessing or not 
a strong odor and flavor; and being 
easily affected by acid. 

General, Rules 

Hydrate gelatine in four to six times 
its volume of cold water. 

Dissolve over hot water, or by ad- 
dition of an equal volume of boiling 
water to hydrated gelatine, or by ad- 
dition of hot flavoring liquid; e.g., 
coffee or milk. 

Sweeten with one-fourth as much 
sugar as desired volume of jelly. Ex- 
ception, coffee or milk, one-eighth as 
much sugar as jelly. 

Flavor with one-fourth to one-half 
as much liquid, fruit juice, cider, 
wine, etc., as desired volume of jelly. 
Exception, lemon, use one-half as 
much as of other flavors. 

Foregoing rules can be formulated 
by student from selected recipes for 
various jellies or can be given as above, 
at teacher's discretion. 

Action of ferments on Gelatine 
Hydrate, dissolve, and sweeten a 
small quantity of gelatine. Divide 
into four parts, A, B, C, and D. 

i. To A add one-half its volume 
canned pineapple juice or pulp. 

2. To B add the same quantity 
fresh pineapple juice or pulp. 

3. To C add milk. 

4. To D add milk, with the addition 
of a little pancreatine, one teaspoonful 
Benger's liquor pancreatus to one-half 
cup milk. Let stand in a cool place 
twenty to thirty minutes, and compare. 

Comparison of Gelatine and Albumen 

1. Dried egg albumen and granu- 
lated gelatine compared, — weight, 
color, texture, etc. 

2. Place in test tubes a small por- 
tion of each, add a little water, and, 
after a few minutes, a few drops 



strong nitric acid. Boil. Compare. 
On cooling, add a little ammonia. 
Compare. 

3. To small quantities of dissolved 
egg albumen and gelatine in test tubes 
add a few drops Millon's reagent, and 
boil. Compare. (Reaction to Mil- 
lon's reagent indicates presence of 
tyrosin group in molecule. Pure gel- 
atine is best to use for this test, but 
some brands of commercial gelatine 
answer very well.) 

4. To small quantities of dissolved 
gelatine and egg albumen in test tubes 
add one-half volume acetic acid. 

Exercises 

The ,f exercises" are problems in 
practical cookery to be solved by the 
student, with the minimum of direc- 
tion, by means of the knowledge 
gained in preceding study of the food 
substance. 

i. Tomato jelly in ring. Centre 
filled with blanched and curled celery. 
Improvise ring mould. 

2. Fruits, nuts, etc., moulded in 
given design in a jelly mould. 

3. Pineapple jelly made with fresh 
pineapple. 

4. Bavarian creams, — gelatine jelly, 
flavored and beaten, mixed with 
whipped cream. 

5. Ribbon jelly, using milk, yolk of 
egg f and coffee. Flavor milk and yolk 
of egg with fruit juice. 

6. Hamburg sponge. Combine gel- 
atine, lemon juice, sugar, whites of 
eggs, yolks of eggs, milk, and cream, 
producing a dish that will look like a 
miniature Mont Blanc. 

A specified amount of some one in- 
gredient can be given by the teacher 
as the basis for each dish. Drawings 
or blackboard illustrations can be 
used as models for the construction of 
the various exercises. In most classes 
this work is better given after the ref- 
erences have been studied and the re- 
view questions discussed.

TO woman it is given to add

ing how wealth shall be used. . . .

THE WOMAN WHO SPENDS 

THIS is the title of a little 
book by Bertha J. Richard- 
son on the subject of eco- 
nomics, and is of interest to even- 
thoughtful woman. The consump- 
tion rather than the production of 
wealth has come to be regarded chiefly 
as the economic function of woman. 
" To-day it is the woman who spends, 
and upon her rests the responsibility 
for the standards that govern the 
spending for home and community. 
It is for women to build up that de- 
partment of economics so long neg- 
lected by the economist, the science 
of consumption. This, in the woman's 
world, means the spending of money 
for life's environment, — home, travel, 
books, music, food, dress, — all things 
included in the living of life. . . . The 
club that started to take the interests 
of its members out of their homes, 
to give women broader interests, to 
take them out of themselves, has found 
that such a journey has only led them 
back to their own homes. The woman's 
club is teaching women mutual help- 
fulness as the stepping-stone to mutual 
advantage along every line; and wise 
spending of time, effort, and money, is 
now the first consideration of these or- 
ganizations." 

The wise spending of time, effort, and 
money, is just what is meant by eco- 
nomics, as far as the home-maker is 
concerned; and the significance of the 
matter involved who can tell? The 
primary needs of physical life, the ma- 
terial things which men must have in 
order to live, are said to be food, cloth- 
ing, shelter, air, and sunlight; and in 
the effort to secure these the majority 
of people spend two-thirds of their in-

have 






come. That these may be had under 
the best conditions, as pure food, health- 
ful clothing, sanitary homes, sufficient 
air and sunlight, in order to attain the 
best results in health and happiness, is 
the problem that faces everywhere the 
spending woman. 

We commend this little book as a 
timely introduction to the intelligent 
study of problems of first importance. 
The simple life, the economic function 
of women from twentieth-century point 
of view, are subjects that challenge 
the best thoughts of the best minds of 
the age. The tendency of the day is 
not a return to the conditions of primi- 
tive life, when men and women were 
alike engaged in the production of 
wealth, but, under better modern con- 
ditions, to conduct the whole range of 
life along lines that shall conduce ever 
to the larger welfare of all. 

Progressive man is beginning to real- 
ize that the highest good of each — phys- 
ical, mental, and moral — depends upon 
the highest good of all; and upon the 
modern woman has devolved the respon- 
sibility of spending the larger part of 
the world's wealth in such a manner as 
to supply to best advantage the vital 
needs of those for whom she spends, — 
in other words, "to pursue that course 
of higher living in which the practical 
side has become a means of perfecting 
the highest moral and spiritual well- 
being." 



OUR ANNUAL FESTIVALS 

OUR annual Thanksgiving Day 
has come and gone. As a 
people, we have had much to 
be thankful for, much of peace and 
health and prosperity. Thanksgiving 
Day is indissolubly connected and asso- 
ciated with good living, the conditions 
for which, on the whole, were never 
more favorable and encouraging than 
they are at the present time. But for 
other reasons than that of feasting and 



good cheer this annual reunion of 
families is ever memorable, — ever 
worthy to be commemorated ; for what- 
ever tends to sweeten and strengthen 
family ties and home life should be 
most assiduously cultivated and sus- 
tained. "Sure good," says Ruskin, — 
and the saying cannot be repeated too 
often, — "is first in feeding people, then 
in dressing people, then in lodging 
people, and lastly in rightly pleasing 
people with arts or sciences or any 
other subject of thought." And all 
these things point primarily to the 
home as the centre of all that is de- 
sirable and best in life. 

The "Merry Christmas" and the 
"Happy New Year" are still before 
us. With these gift-making is in- 
separably joined, and the custom of 
giving is steadily growing in magni- 
tude and favor. As the Christmas 
season approaches, railroads are over- 
taxed, and the post-office system is 
quite inadequate to the demands made 
upon it. Certainly the occasion is ap- 
propriate for giving, and, while "in- 
discriminate charity" is no longer rec- 
ognized as desirable, the practice of 
giving wisely and in accordance with 
one's means is righteous altogether and 
wholesome indeed. Like another and 
companion virtue, "it blesseth him 
that gives and him that takes." The 
time is fitting for cheerfulness and the 
exchange of tokens of remembrance, 
and the pleasure of its observance 
should be unalloyed. 

But, after all has been said, the best 
way to help the needy is to give them 
dollars or, what is the same thing, 
work that will bring dollars. Like 
education, the best way to impart in- 
struction is by way of example, and not 
by precept. Words are cheap. In 
this age all things are tested by their 
value when translated into terms of 
work done. As some one has said, 
we must prove our worth by our work. 
" Life lies in the quest."

WAYS AND MEANS 

THE present issue of this maga- 
zine is no fewer than twenty 
thousand copies. We are 
justly proud of such a goodly list of 
subscribers, and ar- certain that, as 
a class, more appreciative readers than 
ours cannot be desired. But, when the 
millions of homes in this country are 
considered, it is evident that the Cook- 
ing-School Magazine is not extensively 
known. Verily not far from the homes 
of our readers are multiples of twenty 
thousand home-makers to whom the 
publication is entirely unknown. And 
doubtless many of these would be just 
as well pleased with the magazine, and 
just as appreciative of its usefulness, 
if a copy of it were once placed in their 
hands. 

While we cannot hope that our sub- 
scribers will exercise care or thought in 
our behalf, we fain would have them 
note the special offers of premiums we 
make them from time to time, — offers 
that may prove of mutual interest and 
helpfulness. Again, in case each of our 
present subscribers, in making her own 
renewal, could give us the name of a 
neighbor or friend, who might be pleased 
with the magazine, we would gladly 
send each a specimen copy, and thus 
afford many a stranger an opportunity 
to examine the nature of our work, and 
become a subscriber or not at pleasure. 
The only compensation we can offer 
for favors like these is a better publi- 
cation. We propose to improve the 
Cooking-School Magazine, as far as it 
lies in our power to do with the means 
at our command. And it is well 
known that the quality and character 
of a publication depend almost exclu- 
sively upon the extent of its clientage. 
Our steady and wholesome growth 
in the past is due, in large measure, 
to the kind offices of our friends and 
patrons. 



EXTENT OF OUR FARMING 
INDUSTRY 

WHILE much has been writ- 
ten as to the value and extent 
of our agricultural resources, 
not many persons realize how large a 
factor the farming industry is in the 
prosperity which the American people 
are now enjoying. A few facts and 
figures from a recent census bulletin on 
this subject may be a help in this direc- 
tion. According to this showing, on 
June i, 1903, there were 5.739»657 
farms in this country, valued at $16,- 
674,690,247, of which 78.6 per cent, 
represented land and improvements, 
and 21.4 per cent, buildings. On these 
farms were implements and machinery 
valued at $761,001,638. Since 1850 
the farms have multiplied four times, 
and the total values more than five 
times. Gains of value in the West have 
much more than offset the Eastern de- 
crease. Among the farming States, 
New York is high in rank among the 
agricultural States of the Union. It is 
surprised by Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, 
Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, in 
that order. After hearing so much as 
we have in years past about the un- 
profitableness of farming, we are hardly 
prepared for the statement that the 
farming industry of the United States 
for the year 1903 turned in a gross 
profit of 18.3 per cent., and we believe 
that the time is not far distant when 
under more scientific and systematic 
methods of agriculture the per cent, of 
profit from this source will be two or 
three times the figures named. It is 
certain that we are only beginning to 
realize the possibilities of agriculture 
as a source of wealth.

IN all recipes where floor is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting on 
When floor is measured by cups, the cap is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. 
tables poonful or a teaspoonful of any designated materia] is a level spoonful of such material. 



Corned Beef Soup 
Cover a piece of rather fresh corned 
beef, weighing about four pounds (the 
thick end of the rib is a good cut for 
this purpose), with cold water. Heat 
slowly to the boiling-point, then sim- 
mer until the meat is tender. There 
should then be about two quarts (per- 
haps less) of broth of the proper salt- 
ness for soup. When cold, remove 
the fat. Cut a small onion in halves, 
and then in thin slices, cut a small car- 
rot and two or three heart stalks of 
celery in slices, and, if at hand, half a 
green or red pepper pod. Cook these 
in water until tender, then add with 
about half a cup of cooked macaroni, 
cut in rings, to the soup, heated to the 
boiling-point. If the beef be properly 
cooked, the broth will be nearly as 
clear as consomme. Wash the meat 
before setting it to cook. 



Bran Muffins 

(Breakfast or Supper) 

Press through a sieve, together, one 
cup of flour, one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt, and one teaspoonful of soda. 
Add two cups of bran, one cup and a 
half of thick sour milk, three table- 
spoonfuls of molasses, and one-fourth 
a cup of softened butter. Mix thor- 
oughly, and bake about half an hour 
in a well-buttered muffin-pan. These 
muffins are recommended for those 
who suffer from constipation. 

Salmon Mousse 

(Fish Course for Dinner or Luncheon) 
Remove the skin and bones from 
enough uncooked salmon to give half 
a pound of solid fish. Less than a 
pound of fish will be needed. Pound 
the fish in a mortar, then add the un- 
cooked yolks of two eggs, and pound

chicken or fish stock, flavored with 
vegetables and sweet herbs, and cooled. 
When the mixture is smooth, after all 
the sauce has been added, press it 
through a puree sieve, then set aside 
to become chilled. Beat one cup of 
double cream solid, and the whites of 
two eggs dry. Fold the egg into the 
fish preparation with a generous half 
teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pa- 
prika, then fold in the cream. Turn 
the mixture into a mousse mould, well 



mould with Hollandaise, drawn butter, 
fish Bechamel, or oyster sauce in a

Apricot Short C*ke 

A Child's Christmas Cake 

(Dessert, Party, or Supper) 

Beat three eggs. Then gradually 

beat in one cup and a half of sugar and 



half a teaspoonful of lemon extract. 
Add one cup and a half of flour, sifted 
with one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, 
three-fourths a 
level teaspoonful 
of soda, and two 
and one-half level 
teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar (or 
two and one-fourth 
level teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder) . 
When thoroughly 
mixed, beat in 
three-fourths a cup 
of hot milk. Bake 
in a well-buttered 
tube pan about half an hour. When 
cold, cover with boiled caramel frost- 
ing, and decorate with small red 
candies. 

Boiled Caramel Frosting 
Boil one cup of sugar and one-fourth 
a cup of water until it threads, or to 
236 by the sugar thermometer. In 
the mean time cook one-fourth a cup 
of sugar to the caramel stage. Add 
two or three tablespoonfuls 
of boiling water, and cook 
until the caramel is dissolved. 
Add this to the first mixture, 
when this mixture threads or 
registers 236 . If the syrup 
does not now register 236° 
and does not thread, cook 
until this condition is reached. 
Then pour in a fine stream 
onto the white of one egg 
beaten until very foamy and 
nearly dry. Beat the egg 
mixture constantly while 
adding the syrup, and, occa- 
sionally, until cool and thick, 
then spread a part over the 
cake, and with forcing bag and star tube 
pipe the remainder upon the cake. 
The layer over the cake needs be very 
thin.

into a pan. Surround the mould with 
boiling water, and let bake until the 
custard is firm. The water 
should not boil after the dish 
is set into the oven. When 
cold, loosen the custard 
from the edge of the dish, 
and invert over a serving- 
dish. Beat one cup of double 
cream, one-fourth a cup of 
sugar, and half a teaspoonful 
of vanilla extract until firm. 
Then pipe this (with pastry 
bag and star tube) into the

Sprinkle with chopped and 
browned almonds. 

Almond Macaroons 

(For Sweet Course at Luncheon or Dinner) 
Put half a pound of almond paste 
and the white of an egg in a mixing 
bowl. With the hand beat the two 
to a perfectly smooth mass, then add

Honey Cakes 
("Teas" or Sweet Course at Dinner or 
Luncheon) 
Melt two ounces or one-fourth a cup 
of butter. Add one cup of strained 
honey. Let cool, then add the grated 
yellow rind of a lemon, one tablespoon- 
ful of lemon juice, two ounces of sweet 
almonds, blanched and chopped fine, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of mace, half 
a teaspoonful of soda, and two cups 
and a half of flour, sifted together. 
Mix thoroughly, then set aside, cov- 
ered, in a cool place for twelve hours. 



with a cup of sugar and half a cup of 
water boiled to a thick syrup. Let 
the syrup cool slightly before using. 

New Orleans Jumbles 

(For "Teas" ot to accompany Sweet Course at 
Dinner or Luncheon) 
Cream one cup of butter. Beat into 
it one cup of sugar and the grated rind 
of one orange and one lemon, then 
work in three cups of sifted flour. 
Break one egg upon the dough, and 
work it in thoroughly. Dredge the 
moulding board with sugar, and upon 
it roll with the hands small pieces of 
dough, as in shaping bread sticks. 
Join the ends of the pencils of dough, 
to make rings an inch and a half or two 
inches in diameter. Bake on a but- 
tered baking tin in moderate heat. 
Remove from the tins with a spatula. 
Do not pile one above another while 
cooling. These are rich, well-flavored 
jumbles.

into it, gradually, half a cup of sugar 
and the grated rind of a lemon, then 
beat in one cup of strained honey and 
two cups of flour. Spread this mixture 
in baking-tins, or on tin sheets, form- 
ing very thin rounds about two inches 
in diameter. Use a palette knife to 
spread the mixture. Bake in a 
moderately heated oven. After they 
have been removed from the oven 
about one minute, lift them from the 
tins with a palette knife, and shape 
them over a piece of a clean broom 
handle. 

White Layer Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter. Beat 
in gradually one cup of sugar, then, 
little by little, one-fourth a cup of milk. 
Flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla 
extract, then beat in one cup and a 
half of sifted flour, sifted again with 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of soda and 
one level teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
One teaspoonful anil a half, level 
measurement, of baking-powder may 
be used in place of the soda and cream 
of tartar). Lastly beat in the whites 
of four eggs, beaten dry. 

Almond Filling for Layer Cake 

Beat one-fourth a pound of almond 
paste with the yolk of an egg until 
smooth, then add the yolks of four 
more eggs, one after another, beating 
each yolk smoothly into the mixture 
before the next one is added. Add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
ounces of blanched almonds, chopped 
fine, a generous half-cup of sugar, and 
half a cup of hot milk. Cook over hot 
water, stirring constantly, until the 
mixture thickens. When cold, flavor 
with half a teaspoonful of vanilla ex- 
tract, and use to put between the 
layers of cake. Finish the cake with 
a boiled frosting, adding here and 
there slices of almond blanched and 
browned in the oven. This quantity 
of filling is enough for two cakes or 



one cake and half a dozen pastry 
tarts. 

Banbury Tarts, Modern Style 

Roll trimmings of puff paste into a 
sheet one-fourth an inch thick. Dip 
a diamond-shaped cutter into hot water, 
and with it cut the paste into diamond 
shapes. With a sharp knife wet in 
hot water score the tops half through 
and about quarter of an inch from the 
edge, let chill half an hour on ice, then 
brush the tops with yolk of egg beaten 
and diluted with one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of milk, and set to cook in a hot 
oven, protecting the tops with a piece 
of paper. When fully risen, remove 
the paper, to brown the tops. When 
baked, cut around in the scoring and 
take out the ' 'covers," remove any un- 
cooked paste, and fill with banbury 
mixture. Put the covers in place, and 
serve. 

Banbury Mixture 

Stone one cup of raisins, and chop 
them very fine with one-fourth a pound 
of citron or candied cherries. Add the 
grated rind and juice of a lemon, one 
cup of sugar, and one egg, slightly 
beaten. Cook the mixture over hot 
water until thickened slightly. 

Apricot Souffle, Chafing-dish Style 

(Sweet Dish for Luncheon or Supper) 

Beat the yolks of five eggs until 
thick, and continue beating while five 
tablespoonfuls of sugar are added. 
Then beat in about three-eighths (scant 
half) a cup of apricot pure*e (apricots 
pressed through a sieve), and fold in 
the whites of five eggs beaten dry. 
Have the blazer of the chafing-dish 
made hot over hot water. With a piece 
of butter on a fork oil the inside of 
the blazer thoroughly, and turn in the 
mixture. Cover and let cook about 
twenty minutes, then, if firm to the 
touch in the centre of the top, remove 
the hot-water pan for an instant, and 



1

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



set the blazer directly over the flame. 
Let brown slightly, then return the 
hot-water pan to place, and serve the 
soufite from the blazer. Serve half a 
canned apricot and a spoonful of the 
syrup with each portion. 

Fondant, Latest Method 

Stir two pounds (four cups) of sugar 
and a cup and a half of water over the 
fire until the sugar is melted. Just be- 
fore the syrup begins to boil, with a 
hand, a brush, or a cloth dampened in 
cold water, wash down the sides of the 
kettle, to remove any grains of sugar 
from the sides of the pan. When the 
syrup begins to boil, add three drops 
of acetic acid or half a level teaspoonful 
of cornstarch. Cover the kettle, and 
let boil for two or three minutes, to re- 
move any grains of sugar that may 
yet remain on the saucepan. Now re- 
move the cover, and set a sugar ther- 
mometer into the syrup, letting it lean 
against the side of the kettle. Put the 
thermometer in gently, to avoid sugar- 
ing the syrup ; for the same reason do 
not move or jar the kettle in any way. 
Have ready a marble slab or a large 
platter set in a cool place, and, when 
the mercury in the thermometer be- 
gins to approach 240°, dampen the 
slab or platter with the hand wet in 
cold water. The moment the ther- 
mometer registers 240 (see page 270), 
take it from the saucepan, and take 
up the saucepan carefully and without 
shaking, and pour the syrup onto the 
slab or platter. Do not scrape the 
saucepan or allow the syrup to drip 
from it, as all sugary portions must be 
removed from the fondant, or it will 
be grainy when worked. Let the 
syrup remain undisturbed until it is 
absolutely cold. This is an important 
point to remember. When there is no 
heat left in the syrup, with a scraper 
(such as is used in removing wall 
paper) or a wooden spatula turn the 



outside of the fondant towards the 
centre, then continue turning from 
the edges towards the centre for some 
time, or until it begins to look creamy. 
Then, gradually, work it up into a ball, 
scraping the marble or platter clean. 
When all is collected together, wring 
out a piece of heavy cloth in cold water, 
and lay this damp cloth over the ball 
on the slab, tucking it in around the 
edges, and let it stand for an hour or 
more, to season. Cut it into pieces, 
and put in a stone jar, deep enough to 
allow of its being covered with a damp 
cloth that does not touch it. When 
ready to use, take out such portion as 
is desired, let melt, stirring constantly, 
over hot water, adding a very little 
hot water, if needed, and flavoring and 
tint as desired. Melted chocolate and 
a flavoring of vanilla is used in the 
candies shown in the illustration. In 
this drop, one by one, centres made 
of the fondant, mixed with nuts and 
candied fruit and a little confectioner's 
sugar, to obviate the stickiness of the 
fondant. When a centre is covered, 
take out with a hook, and drop onto 
paraffin paper or a tin sheet. Halved 
or chopped pistachio nuts make a 
pretty decoration for such bonbons. 
For maple fondant use two pounds 
of maple sugar, one pound of white 
granulated sugar, and a pint of 
water, and proceed as for the white 
fondant. 

Baking-powder Bread (Ida T. von 

Herm) 

For two loaves of bread pass to- 
gether through a sieve six cups of 
Graham or whole-wheat flour (or three 
cups of each), eight level teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder, and one teaspoonful 
of salt. Add one quart of sweet milk, 
and mix thoroughly. Then beat vigor- 
ously, and turn into a buttered bread- 
pan. Bake forty-five minutes in a 
moderate oven.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 



ABUNDANCE of air and water 
are much more necessary to our 
well-being than our habits in re- 
gard to the use of these would indi- 
cate. So essential are fresh air and 
pure water to a continuation of life 
that even scientific writers often speak 
of them as foods. And yet, when win- 
ter comes upon us, life out of doors is 
almost relinquished. Heavy hangings 
before tightly closed windows shut out 
fresh air, and water is taken only at 
rare intervals, simply to allay thirst. 
If one does not exercise with sufficient 
vigor to start perspiration, the demand 
for water may not be so pronounced as 
to impel the partaking of it, but none 
the less is water needed to eliminate 
the waste matter of the body. 

If one eat but little, he may be able 
to get along, even if he be confined to 
scant allowance of fresh air, for the 
quantity of carbon to be oxidized calls 
for less supply of oxygen; but, as a 
rule, the winter season is the time 
when feasting is in order, and a generous 
diet is indulged in. Undoubtedly, over- 
eating by those who live in hot, stuffy, 
ill-ventilated rooms causes quite as 
much disease and suffering as does 
under-eating by those who live in 
draughty, cold quarters. 

The apostolic command, "that if any 
one would not work, neither should he 
eat," is based on physiological laws. 
Work or exercise calling into use any 
set of muscles wears away tissue, and 



food is needed to replace it, the quan- 
tity needed being in proportion to the 
amount of tissue destroyed or the 
work done. 

At this season of feasting, exercise 
good judgment, provide bountifully for 
the young, athletic, and vigorous, and 
practise a nice and wise discrimination 
that borders on frugality in planning 
meals for those who are "shut in" 
either from inclination or sickness. 

Colds are, in large measure, the re- 
sult of improper eating, lack of bathing 
and water-drinking. The old adage, 
"Stuff a cold and starve a fever," is 
now known to be erroneous. In both 
cases, food is needed to keep up the 
strength, and this is to be done neither 
by stuffing nor starving, but by the 
ingestion of a sufficient quantity of 
proper food and at stated intervals. 

Rheumatism is but a form of gout, 
and it may be avoided to a great ex- 
tent, if not wholly, by discarding acid- 
making foods (sugar and meat), and 
cutting down the quantity of other 
foods to a reasonable limit, and by 
drinking at proper intervals a generous 
quantity of water. 

The habit of drinking a cup, even 
a pint, of water the first thing on aris- 
ing and the last thing before retiring 
is a very simple one to form. Add a 
glass of water midway between the 
breakfast and noonday meal, and an- 
other between the last two meals of 
the day, and eventually all the elimi-

nating processes of the body will be sat- 
isfactorily carried on. Take a cold 
bath on arising, and ten deep breaths 
in the open air four or five times a day, 
add water as above, and proper food 
partaken in cheerful surroundings, and 
one has the proper conditions for en- 
joying many a merry Christmas. 

Concerning Menus and Recipes 

In our recipes, from month to month, 
whenever fat is called for, we generally 
use the word "butter." We do not do 
this with the idea that butter is the 
only satisfactory form of fat. We use 
the word only as a synonym of the kind 
of article needed. To use butter, in- 
discriminately, for all purposes is worse 
than extravagant, for oftentimes other 
forms of fat are far preferable. In 
making sauces, stock may not always 
be at hand, but its absence will not be 
so noticeable, if the fat from the top of 
the soup-kettle or from the liquor in 
which a fowl has been cooked be used 
as the medium in which the flour for 
the sauce is cooked. Fat carries flavor, 
and the fat from the top of the soup- 
kettle holds quite as much of the flavor 
of meat, vegetable, and sweet-herb as 
is retained in the broth. If nothing 
but sweet, fresh poultry be purchased, 
every particle of fat from them may 
be used to advantage, and the bones, 
cooked at a low temperature, will give 
a delicate broth for the foundation 
of many a soup. Substitute chicken 
fat for butter in making your next 
cream-of-celery or pea or other vege- 
table soup, or when wishing a Bechamel 
sauce with chicken flavor, and note the 
result. The fat from chicken and the 
soup-kettle is good also for use in dishes 
of rice, hominy, and macaroni. In 
these, too, as well as in all meat dishes, 
bacon fat is a welcome addition. There 
is one point, however, that needs be 
noticed in connection with bacon fat. 
Often the fat is discolored and ren- 
dered less wholesome by subjecting it 



to too high a temperature; We have 
yet to learn that most food, in cooking, 
requires only gentle heat. 

The left-over slices of broiled bacon 
put between two slices of any kind of 
bread make a most excellent sand- 
wich for the dinner basket or pail, or 
they may be chopped with the meat 
for a dish of hash. Lyonnaise pota- 
toes, made with bacon fat or fat from 
the top of the soup-kettle, will prove 
quite as acceptable as when butter is 
used. Of course, the use of these fats 
must be confined to savory dishes. 
Butter is the fat par excellence when 
sweet dishes are concerned. We have 
said nothing of olive oil in this connec- 
tion, as in point of first expense it 
ranks with butter; but for frying pur- 
poses butter cannot be compared with 
olive oil. The burning or smoking 
temperature of olive oil is very high, 
and with care the oil may be used for 
deep frying again and again with good 
results. 

German coffee cake is made of a 
sweetened yeast dough in which eggs 
and butter are used. When put into 
a shallow pan to bake, the top is 
dredged with sugar and cinnamon, or 
sugar and sliced almonds. It may be 
made light and ready for baking in the 
evening, then set aside on ice or in the 
refrigerator until morning. With choc- 
olate or coffee, it affords a substantial 
finish to a light breakfast. 

For the pineapple souffld given as a 
dessert dish, make use of the customary 
formula for custard souffte, simply sub- 
stituting a cup of juice and pulp from 
a can of grated pineapple for the cup 
of milk in the custard recipe. The 
juice of half a lemon will accentuate, 
or give point, to the pineapple flavor. 

During the yule-tide season, sweets 
seem to be quite universally desired; 
and we have given up, for this number, 
our pages of illustrated recipes almost 
exclusively to sweet dishes. 

One of good judgment, gained by

experience, by constant attention and 
frequent testing, can make boiled frost- 
ings, fondant, and other cooked sugar 
confections successfully; but the use of 
a thermometer simplifies the processes 
of sugar boiling, and makes an other- 
wise possible success certain. In any 
dish for which sugar and liquid, as 
water, are boiled to a definite degree 
or stage, wait until the mixture begins 
to boil, then carefully put the ther- 
mometer into the kettle, and let it re- 
main until it indicates that the mixture 
is cooked to the proper degree. At 
this point remove the kettle at once 
from the fire. 

One may say that thermometers are 
of little use in candy-making, because 
they are liable to register incorrectly. 
This, however, makes no special differ- 
ence, if one knows how to interpret the 
thermometer, and regulates the cook- 
ing accordingly. Test the thermometer 
in water at the boiling-point. It should 
register 212 when plunged into a kettle 
of boiling water. If it registers, for in- 



stance, 209 , you know, at once, that 
the thermometer is three degrees out, 
and that, in boiling sugar for boiled 
frosting, it should register 233 instead 
of 236 . If it registers 215 in boiling 
water, it should register 239 for boiled 
frosting. Thus, by testing a thermom- 
eter with boiling water, this fancied 
difficulty may be obviated.

On Training the Foreign Maid 



By Mrs. C. DeL. Stone 



THE name "greenhorn," — for 
which, by the way, we are in- 
debted to our genial Wash- 
ington Irving, — what terrors it has! 
We wish a maid. None capable is to 
be found, so we say we will take a 
• ' greenhorn ' ' and train her. Whereupon 
is deposited in our kitchen a raw, ruddy 
specimen of foreignity, with coarse 
nailed shoes and bright red flannel 
waists, deaf to all seeming, and dumb, 
too, be she German, Finnish, Nor- 
wegian, or Swedish. But, if a terror to 
us, what to her ? Plumped down, prob- 
ably from a foreign village, among 



a strange-talking, strange-acting, and 
strange-living people, she is expected 
to dress like an American, talk like an 
Englishman, and cook like a French- 
man. In speaking with a Norwegian 
maid on the anniversary of her being 
a year in this country, she said: "I 
am glad it is now, not then. That 
was very hard." The mistress must 
not forget there are two in the bar- 
gain. 

• 
Training her to Speak 

Assuming, then, that the "green- 
horn" does not speak English, the first 



On Training the Foreign Maid 



271 



necessity is to establish a means of 
communication. To accomplish this, 
the mistress must possess three quali- 
ties, — in the first place, patience; in 
the second, patience; and, in the third, 
patience. On the maid's part there is 
necessary a moderate amount of brain. 
Don't reason, however, that because 
she stands and looks at you, at first, 
seemingly helpless and hopeless, that 
she must be utterly devoid of that com- 
modity. Remember she is shy and 
strange. A knowledge of a few words 
of her language, easily attained, would 
be of immense help, otherwise the sign 
language must be depended upon. 
Touch a thing, pronounce its name 
slowly and distinctly, force her to look 
straight at you, to insure attention, 
and repeat what you said. Insist that 
she uses the few words she knows, and 
more each day. Do not let her talk 
jargon. "No," I say, when a medley 
of words is hurled at me in the swift 
foreign style. "Speak slowly, and only 
English." This done, progress, though 
slow, is assured. The ambitious girl 
will purchase and study a grammar of 
her language into English, — an effort the 
mistress will naturally encourage and 
aid. The pictured advertisements in 
magazines make easy first helps; and 
the Bible, with its passages familiar to 
all mankind, has taught many a person 
a foreign language. 

The Rule of Routine 

The first means of communication 
established, the rest is easier, providing 
the mistress herself understands house- 
work. If she doesn't, woe to her and 
her family! The best thing she can do, 
then, is to take a course in domestic 
science at one of the excellent schools 
established now in almost every city, 
and teach the maid what she learns. 
However, there is one general rule al- 
ways to be adhered to. It is the rule 
of routine. Teach that there is a place 
for everything and a time for every- 



thing. Have things done from the 
start as you wish them, and let them be 
done so always. Nothing confuses or 
ruins a good maid more than a lack of 
system. You must not expect her to 
adapt herself to circumstances as you 
can, and do things, now one way now 
another. If you wish your meals served 
nicely when company is present, you 
must have them served so each day and 
each meal. The maid may try to re- 
member your directions, but she will 
surely become confused and slip into 
her ordinary way of service or non- 
service. Besides, the pleasure and com- 
fort of the family would be greatly 
increased by orderliness and dignity in 
the home, to say nothing of the man- 
ners of the children. Hence nothing 
is more important than this rule of 
routine. It is the moral one of form- 
ing a habit. 

Giving Orders 

In giving directions, be explicit, con- 
cise, and rational. Never give an order 
unless you mean to have it carried out. 
If it is not necessary to be done, cer- 
tainly it is not necessary to give; and 
a maid will respect a mistress more, if 
she knows her commands are neither 
foolish nor thoughtless. Moreover, 
know your own mind. Do not take 
back an order unless there is an urgent 
reason, and do not give one that can- 
not be carried out. "Mary, we'll have 
a tapioca pudding for desert," you call 
down, just as you are leaving the house 
with a friend; and Mary finds, when she 
comes to make the pudding, that there 
isn't a bit of tapioca in the larder. 
"She ought to have told me," you say; 
and so she ought. But, nevertheless, 
the responsibility is yours. The orders 
for the day should be given immediately 
after breakfast, provision made for their 
fulfilment, and, unless absolutely nec- 
essary, they should not be changed. 
This makes the work of the day busi- 
ness-like, and renders a maid responsible. 



2J2

If she is inclined to forget, have a slate 
hanging in the kitchen, on which you 
write out the menu. 

Finding Fault 

In the first place, don't find fault. 
That is, do not complain or whine or 
nag. Do not say: "Mary, I don't see 
why you can't remember. I am sure I 
get tired of telling you again and again. 
Now, if I were in your place," etc., 
whereupon Mary replies saucily; and 
there is a scene from which you depart 
incensed, yet humbly, lest Mary leave 
then and there. Guard your tone. Be 
firm and business-like, but cheerful. 
Impart an air of finality to your re- 
marks. "It would please me to have 
you do so and so," or "I think it would 
be better that this be done in this way." 
If it be said kindly, but firmly, it usu- 
ally commands respect, and, more- 
over, gives little occasion for reply. 
Finally, don't always enter the kitchen 
with a complaint. It creates an un- 
pleasant relation between employed 
and employer. 

The Salary 

Unfortunately, this is more a per- 
sonal question than it should be. In 
this country there is no fixed rate, ex- 
cept in a general way, for domestic 
sendee. Usually, the maid demands as 
much as she dares, and the mistress pays 
only what she must. On the whole, 
however, domestic service is well paid 
for. Statistics prove that the average 
cook receives more than the average 
grade school-teacher, in view of the fact 
that she receives her home and board 
and, frequently, clothes. That is, the 
cook can save more. Yet the emolu- 
ment is scarcely too high. The hours 
of service are long, the work frequently 
hard, and there are no social advan- 
tages, if not quite the reverse. There- 
fore, do not raise the maid's wages be- 
grudgingly because you have taught her 
M she knows. Morally, she is indebted 



to you; but, commercially, her knowl- 
edge, however gained, has a certain 
value of which she quickly becomes 
conscious and which you must recog- 
nize. As she becomes more valuable, 
raise her salary as a mark of merit be- 
fore she asks you rather than have her 
drag it from you because you are afraid 
she will leave you if you don't. If she 
is now doing the work of a competent 
girl, do not fancy she is unjust to you 
because she wishes the wages of one. 
Of course, if your means are limited, 
you must expect to go on training 
"greenhorns" to the end of the chapter; 
and I have known of women forced to 
do this, who considered it their bit of 
work for humanity. Many women 
spend their lives in settlement work, 
teaching the unfortunate to better 
themselves, and, therefore, the world, 
physically and morally; and, if we in 
our homes have rendered possibly a 
half-dozen beings of more worth, we 
have done something toward our share. 
This, of course, requires a philosophical 
mood to recognize; and I fear most of 
us can feel so only in the serene enjoy- 
ment of domestic harmony, not in the 
period of depression and strain between 
trained maid departed and "greenhorn " 
to come. 

Holidays 

The question of holidays and privi- 
leges is also a personal one, varying in 
different sections and in different fami- 
lies. Sometimes the maid has every 
Sunday and every Thursday, sometimes 
the holidays alternate. Yet, in com- 
mon justice, it seems that the maid is 
entitled to each Sunday after the noon 
dinner. The deprivation makes her 
feel too keenly her difference from the 
shop-girl or clerk, who is free to dispose 
of the day as she chooses. If the 
mistress must entertain on Sunday, let 
it be done so simply that a maid's ser- 
vices will not be required. Most people 
dine heartily at a late noon dinner, 



Fudge up to Date 



*73 



their work is lighter, and the system 
requires less food. Therefore, a light 
chafing-dish supper ought to be all 
that is needed, or a cold buffet lun- 
cheon, with hot chocolate or tea. If, 
however, a maid's presence is neces- 
sary, it seems that she should. have 
extra pay on a stated scale. 

A Business Relation 

Thus we must keep in mind that the 
relation between mistress and maid is 
a business (not a moral) one, any more 
than all our relations are moral'. "I 
do not see how she could treat me so, 
when I have been so good to her!" 



How often we hear the plaint! Yet 
often the way a mistress is "good" to 
a girl is in being content with slack 
work, — really the worst possible kind- 
ness, whereas real goodness would be 
in insisting on good work and paying 
for it. Give up expecting gratitude 
as your due or the same feeling of re- 
sponsibility toward you as you feel 
toward your family. The relation 
should be one of kindness and justice 
on the part of the mistress, of honesty 
and endeavor on the part of the maid ; 
but let the mistress remember that, 
as has been said elsewhere, the lifting 
must always come from the top. 



Fudge up to Date 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



FUDGE is as popular now. as 
when it was introduced several 
years ago, replacing the then 
fashionable chocolate caramels, which 
the school-girls of that time described 
as "so chewy.' ' The school-girl of 
to-day puts nearly everything that 
she "just adores" into fudge, except 
her love-letters and her American 
Beauty roses. 

Any expert fudge-maker disdains 
to measure the materials. In they go 
(chocolate, sugar, butter, and milk), 
while she chatters gayly, trusting to a 
little longer boiling or beating to re- 
duce the mass to the proper state for 
turning out, sure that it will be firm 
enough to cut in blocks of the pre- 
scribed size, and yet maintain a light 
and crumbling texture. It is just be- 
fore the fudge is done that the addi- 
tions which give novelty must go in. 
Nuts are always nice. One variety or 
several kinds mixed may be used, all 



the way from the humble peanut to 
the expensive pecan. Then, too, there 
is crystalized ginger, cut in small pieces, 
for those who like this hot and favor- 
ite root from the tropics. Newest of 
all and daintiest is an admixture of 
marshmallows. 

For this the following rule, may be 
used : — 

One-fourth cake of chocolate, two 
cups of granulated sugar, one cup of 
milk, one teaspoonful of butter. Boil 
for five minutes, then take from the 
stove and pour in a heaping saucerful 
of marshmallows torn in small bits. 
Beat until the mixture begins to get 
stiff, then pour it quickly out into but- 
tered pans to cool. Another way is to 
lay the shredded marshmallows over the 
bottom of the pan, and pour the hot 
fudge over it. This is convenient when 
both the marshmallow and the plain 
varieties are to be made from the same 
boiling. This makes a pretty plate-

ful, for the marshmallows flecks the 
brown fudge with bits of snowy white- 
ness and relieves its richness. 

Instead of the old proverb, "Many 
a little makes a midde," the Bryn 
Mawr grocers should change it to 
"Many a nickel makes a mickle"; for 
they keep squares of butter wrapped in 
paraffine paper, which they sell for a 
nickel, ready for the troops of college 
girls who buy just enough for fudge. 
A chafing-dish is the universal, college, 
candy kettle. Since the fire that de- 
stroyed Denbigh Hall, great precau- 
tions have been taken at Bryn Mawr 
to prevent future trouble; and so 
dainty little kitchens, or "tea-pan- 
tries," as they are called, have been 
provided, on each floor of every resi- 
dence hall, for the use of the stu- 
dents, and no chafing-dishes or alcohol 
kettles are allowed to be used in the 
rooms. 

In the second semester at Bryn 
Mawr if a girl refuses candy, it is sup- 
posed that she is keeping Lent, or that 
she has just reached the chapter on 
"Habits" in Prof essor James* text-book 
on Psychology. 

The returning summer girl of 1904 
tells of informal fudge parties held on 
the porches of delightful summer homes. 
Anxious matrons are already going 



over their lists of girls who are excel- 
lent fudge-makers, and attractive as 
well, expecting to summon them as 
helpers in some good cause in the com- 
ing holiday sales. Pudge tables are 
very attractive and yield handsome 
profits at church fairs and bazars and 
they do not require elaborate prepara- 
tions. Remember to be up to date, 
when the time comes, and have plenty 
of marshmallow fudge. 

Not only for the Christmas and New 
Year's season, but also for St. Valen- 
tine's Day, which follows so closely, is 
fudge available. The idea, which orig- 
inated in the brain of a clever New 
York girl, may well be followed this 
year. She made a smooth panful of 
fudge, and with the aid of a heart- 
shaped cooky-cutter made it into 
heart-shaped cakes. When the fudge 
was thoroughly cooled, she placed four 
or five of these heart-shaped cakes to- 
gether on top of a heart of the same 
size, cut out of red cardboard, laid an- 
other red heart on top, and fastened 
the whole with red ribbons. A tiny 
arrow, to suggest Cupid's darts, may be 
tied in, or, if one can use water colors, 
a cover of white rough-surfaced paper 
may be decorated with Cupids and 
roses, and used to give a daintier and 
more artistic effect than the red paper. 



Watch Night 

By Cora A. M . Dolson 



All day the winds in storm had raged 
Across the snowfields white, 

As though the year a battle waged, 
And loath to yield his right. 



But when, at night, the sun went down, 
The storm had lost its power. 

Low in the west a golden crown 
Shone as a parting dower. 



And when the stars, like lights of death, 

Stood in the clear, cold sky, 
It seemed the whole world held its breath 

To see the Old Year die.

WE are glad to publish the follow- 
ing letter. It was inspired by 
the letter printed on page 162 of our 
October issue, though we think the 
writer has not grasped just the idea 
M. P. Q. wished to convey. 

In looking over the manuscript of 
M. P. Q. preparatory to sending it to 
the printer, we inferred, though the 
wording is rather misleading, that the 
items mentioned were given as a sam- 
ple of what was purchased in one week 
rather than in every week. Two boxes 
of strawberries could not be bought 
every week in the year for twenty-five 
cents. Fifty cents' worth of entire- 
wheat flour would not be called for each 
week, nor is it probable that fifteen 
cents are needed to purchase the baking- 
powder every seven days. If twelve 
pounds of sugar and three pounds of 
lard were purchased one week, the way 
would be open to purchase molasses, 
raisins, chocolate, etc., another week. 
We should be glad to- receive more 
letters of this nature. Editor. 

Editor "Boston Cooking-school Magazine" : 

Dear Madame, — In the October number of 
your magazine Mrs. J. writes interestingly of 
the way she makes a small income and a 
family with (presumably) healthy appetites 
strike a satisfactory balance; but it appeared 
to us that the food variety was not well bal- 
anced, when hygienic living was evidently the 
writer's aim. Vegetables and fruits in greater 
abundance would give a more consistent and 



healthful fare. The fruits need not necessarily 
be fresh fruits altogether, but home-canned, 
dried, and evaporated, are admirable from 
the standpoint of healthful diet. 

Mrs. Q. will probably argue that every cent 
she can afford for table use is spent, but I 
would suggest, less lard and sugar by half 
would give fifty cents more per week to spend 
on "the common growths of Mother Earth." 
Surely, six pounds of sugar a week would be 
an ample allowance for a family of five, and 
supply sugar in abundance for all uses. 

At the family round table where vie dis- 
cuss our own and other families' economic 
problems, the question has come up (and will 
not down) anent Mrs. Q.'s management, 
" How can a family of five, aiming for hygienic 
living, or in fact any kind of living, ' get away' 
with three pounds of lard and twelve pounds 
of sugar every week?" The great American 
pie is the burial-place, a "coffyn," indeed, for 
lard and sugar galore; but Mrs. Q. says that 
she never makes pies, deeming them not 
healthful. Her meats are evidently either 
boiling or roasting pieces, or what might be 
termed self-frying, as bacon or pickled pork. 
Comparatively little lard is called for in the 
preparation for the table of the other articles 
she mentions, unless it may be doughnuts; 
and they, when correctly made, will absorb 
very little grease. So where do three pounds 
of lard go weekly? and in louder and more 
agonized tones do I ask, Where, oh, where do 
twelve or thiiceen pounds of sugar vanish 
every seven days ? Over six hundred pounds 
a year! Twelve pounds is a conservative of 
the amount she can buy for seventy-five 
cents. She may get more, that depending 
largely whether the grocers in her home town 
live up to the axiom, Competition is the life 
of trade. 

If you would spare space, another commu- 
nication from Mrs. Q., more in detail, would 
prove interesting. Frances E. P. 

Ogita's Coffee — Japanese 

THE morning after the arrival of 
our new Japanese cook, Ogita, a 
former student at the Methodist Uni- 



276 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



versity, who was obliged to discon- 
tinue his studies on account of a too 
meagre allowance from home, we were 
charmed with the coffee at breakfast. 
It seemed neither like dripped nor 
boiled coffee, but rather the result of 
a happy combination of both methods. 
It had more body than usual, was clear 
as wine and of a rich amber tint. Upon 
remarking to Ogita after breakfast that 
we liked his coffee very much, he re- 
plied, with the almost Chesterfieldian 
courtesy of manner for which the Japs 
are noted, that, if madame would 
honor him by being present in the 
kitchen half an hour before breakfast 
on the following morning, he would 
demonstrate his method of preparing 
the coffee. 

A coffee-pot of the pale blue Stransky 
steel ware, with white porcelain lining, 
of the size that holds a little less 
than five pints, was used. It was as 
immaculately clean as a china cup. 
Ogita measured into it three rounded 
tablespoonfuls (generous) of ground 
coffee, then broke an egg and dropped 
the whole of it in, crushing the shell 
(crushed egg shells alone may be used), 
and added cold water by the table- 
spoonful until the grounds were moist- 
ened. After stirring well, he pushed 
the coffee pot aside, saying it was neces- 
sary for the grounds to soften and 
swell for a few moments. He then half 
filled the pot with boiling water, placed 
it on the gas range, and brought the 
coffee to an active boil, letting it foam 
up to the top of the pot. The flame 
was then lowered until it seemed al- 
most extinguished, and the coffee was 
kept just under the boiling-point for 
about ten minutes or perhaps a little 
longer. Ogita carefully explained that, 
if vapor were allowed to issue from 
the spout at any time after the pre- 
liminary boiling, "all goodness would 
go run away quick." It seemed to 
require no "clearing"; but, after re- 
moving it from the range, Ogita poured 



out a cupful of the richly colored de-

Dear Editor, — I am sending you a 
recipe for soap, and only wish I could 
send you a piece made from the same. 
I have said nothing about the necessity 
of turning away the hand when pouring 
water on the potash. You can add it 
if you think best. My object was to 
have the receipt as condensed as pos- 
sible. 

Hard Soap 

BUY one can of potash, price ten 
cents. Empty the contents into an 
iron pot. Pour on it one quart of cold 
water, and stir until it dissolves, and 
add one tablespoonful of borax. Weigh 
five pounds of grease, and put it into 
another kettle, and let it melt on the 
stove. When this is lukewarm, pour 
it through a strainer in a fine stream 
into the kettle containing the pot- 
ash, stirring constantly. After all the 
grease is used, continue stirring for ten 
minutes. Then pour into two tin 
bread-pans. Before it is stiff, cut it 
into pieces the size desired. This re- 
cipe makes a little over twenty good- 
sized pieces. Next morning take it 
out of the pans, when it will be found 
really hard. 

Cost of Living 

I WAS much interested in the com- 
munication in the October number 
which told how one woman reckoned 
her expenses. 

I have a method which has been 
evolved from my own experience, 
which may possibly be of interest. 

The problem to be solved is, How 
to feed six people (four adults and 



Home Ideas and Economies

two boys, aged sixteen and eleven) on 
ten dollars a week. Out of this ten 
dollars one dollar and fifty cents must 
be saved for the washerwoman. 

I send a list of expenses for one week 
of this year. Seventeen cents a meal 
is allowed for tea, coffee, sugar, milk, 
salt, butter, oatmeal, or bread. The 
full price of anything is reckoned at 
its first serving. If it is "made over," 
the price, of course, is not included 
again. 

The week begins with Monday, so 
that the Sunday expenses have been 
reckoned in the previous week, and 
most of the Monday foods are "left- 
overs." Besides reckoning the cost of 
each meal, the sum to be paid to each 
dealer, is limited. For the provision 
dealer $2.50 per week; the fruit and 
vegetable man, $2 ; the grocer, $2 ; the 
fish man, 50 cents; and the milkman, 
50 cents, leaving $1 for extras, which 
may come up; and they usually do 
"come up."

About Fudge 

AT a church fair held recently, 
many ladies of the society were 
asked to contribute to the candy table. 
Nearly every one of them professed 
herself proficient in the art of making 
fudge, and desired to send that as her 
contribution. 

A varied assortment of fudge was 
displayed, some of which was over an 
inch thick, and some very thin and 
brittle, but not one specimen of them 
all was of the texture that fudge should 
be; that is, part waxy, part creamy, 
and wholly soft, rich, and delicious. 

Fudge of this kind is easy to make 
by the following method, but success 
depends upon paying close heed to 
every detail of the directions. 

Put into a six-quart granite-ware

saucepan three cups of sweet cream 
and six cups of granulated sugar. Set 
over the fire, and stir until it comes to 
a boil. Then add one-eighth of a tea- 
spoonful of cream of tartar. Put a 
tight-fitting cover over the saucepan, 
and let it remain until the steam has 
washed the sides free from sugar. Take 
off the cover, and stir the syrup gently. 
If there is danger of its sticking to the 
bottom, place an asbestos mat under 
the saucepan. Wet a cloth in cold 
water, and frequently wash down the 
sides of the kettle to the syrup's edge, 
to prevent the formation of a sugary 
crust which would be certain to grain 
the candy if poured out over it. 

When the soft-ball degree, or 235 on 
a confectioner's thermometer, has been 
reached, stir in carefully one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of salt and four ounces of 
unsweetened chocolate that has been 
shaved fine or melted. Take the 
saucepan from the fire, and set on a 
wire cake-cooler. Let it remain, abso- 
lutely undisturbed, until lukewarm. 
While it is cooling, line a shallow box 
with waxed paper that has been oiled 
with olive oil. Add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla extract to the syrup, and stir 
it until, by tasting, you can discover 
that it has begun to grain. It should 
be a very fine grain, not at all coarse 
or sugary. Pour it immediately into 
the paper-lined box, and leave it to 
get cold and firm. Then turn out onto 
a sheet of waxed paper, peel the paper 
from the bottom and sides, turn over, 
and score the top with a sharp knife 
into squares, which can be broken 
apart when desired.

More and more regular physicians 
are making much of the mental at- 
mosphere to be provided for patients 
by physicians, nurses, and friends. 
Often that which turns the scale be- 
tween life and death is some slight 
effect produced upon the imagination 
or emotions of a patient, something 
which makes a difference between 
trying and hoping to get well and 
giving up the struggle as useless. Ex- 
periments are made with music, colors, 
flowers, and whatever affects the mind 
of the patient, with results which 
promise still more important discov- 
eries. In the old treatment it was 
well known that prescriptions were 
often made of harmless things be- 
cause pleasing the patient was a help 
to recovery. Such a dose was called 
a placebo, — meaning, "I will please." 
We have heard that in a council of 
physicians one with grave face gave 
his advice that the placeboic treatment 
should be continued. That which was 
formerly done with benevolent guile 
physicians are beginning to do openly, 
with the advice and consent of their 
patients. "A merry heart maketh a 
cheeerful countenance" and helps to cre- 
ate a sound body. — Christian Register. 



Mr. Guy E. Mitchell tells of a strange 
use for milk. He and others have used 
it for painting barns and outbuildings. 
Into a gallon of milk are stirred three 
pounds of Portland cement and enough 
pigment to give the proper color. This 
mixture, spread on the wood, makes 
a coating that after six hours becomes 
as good and lasting as oil paint. It 
makes the best possible paint for trees 
where large limbs have been pruned or 
sawed off, says Mr. Mitchell.— Cfcrw&an

Coffee Cakes from Brioche 

Soften a cake of compressed yeast in 
one-fourth a cup of warm water, and 
stir in flour to make a stiff dough. 
Knead the little ball of dough thor- 
oughly, then drop into a small saucepan 
of lukewarm water, and let stand in a 
temperature of 70 F. until the dough 
floats on top of the water. Put the 
remainder of one pound of flour (4 cups 
equal one pound) into a mixing-bowl. 
Add one-fourth a teaspoonf ul of salt, one 
tablespoonf ul of sugar, ten ounces (one 
cup and a fourth) of butter, softened, 
but not melted, and four eggs. Mix 
these to a paste with the hand, then 
beat in, one at a time, three eggs, beat- 
ing the mixture thoroughly after each 
egg is added. When the ball of sponge 
is light, remove from the water with 
a skimmer, and place in the centre of 
the egg mixture. Fold the egg mixture 
over the sponge, and continue folding 
until the two are thoroughly blended. 
Set aside in a temperature not higher 
than 70 F. until doubled in bulk. 
Turn onto a board dredged with flour, 
pat out, and fold over several times. 
Let rise a second time, then repeat the 



folding, and set aside on ice over night 
to become chilled. Next morning roll 
into a sheet one-fourth an inch thick, 
brush over very lightly with softened 
butter, then fold from the sides towards 
the centre, to make three layers. Cut 
strips three-fourths an inch wide. Take 
each separately, and twist from the 
ends in opposite directions, and shape 
in a figure eight on the baking-sheet. 
Dispose these close together in a baking- 
pan. Brush over with beaten yolk of 
egg diluted with milk. Let rise, and 
bake about twenty-five minutes. When 
cooled somewhat, brush over with con- 
fectioners 1 sugar mixed with boiling 
water. 

Mocha Frosting 

Wash one cup of butter in cold water, 
to free it from salt. Pat, to remove all 
water, then beat to a cream. Add the 
beaten yolk of an egg y and very gradu- 
ally beat into the mixture two cups 
and one-half of confectioners' sugar 
and coffee extract, to give the desired 
flavor and color. A little caramel may 
be added, to heighten the color. The 
proper tint is that of a cup of strong 
coffee with cream. Vienna cream 
sauce, flavored with coffee, makes a 
goodmocha frosting.

making blanc-mange with Irish moss, why 
does the mixture curdle? In the fish pud- 
ding given in the magazine, March, 1904, is 
the halibut cooked before it is put through 
the sieve ? Kindly give full instructions about 
panada." 

Cream-of- Lettuce Soup 

Cleanse and chop a large head of 
lettuce, then saut6 it in two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, with half a teaspoonful 
of sugar. Add three cups of broth or 
water, and let simmer until the lettuce 
is tender. Make a white sauce of three 
tablespoonfuls, each, of butter and 
flour, and a pint of rich milk. Add the 
lettuce and broth, and, if at hand, half 
a cup of cream. Season with about 
a teaspoonful of salt and tabasco or 
paprika to taste. The yolks of two 
eggs beaten and mixed with the cream 
add richness to the soup. Do not boil 
the soup after the addition of the eggs. 

Clam Chowder with Tomato 

Purchase a quart of clams, solid 
measure. Add a cup of cold water, and 
pick over carefully, to remove bits of 
shell. Strain the water and clam juice 
through two folds of cheese-cloth, and 
in it scald the clams. Strain out the 
clams, and keep them hot. In the 
mean time cut a scant quarter a pound 
of fat salt pork into tiny cubes, and 
try out the fat, slowly, to avoid dis- 
coloring. In this saut£ a small onion 
cut in thin slices. Add one-fourth a 
cup of flour, and, when blended with 
the butter, gradually add the strained 
clam liquor. Heat to the boiling-point, 
then strain over a quart of sliced po- 
tatoes that, have been boiled five min- 
utes and drained. Add a little more 
water, if necessary, and cook the po- 
tatoes tender. Then add the clams, 
and two or three cups of canned to- 
matoes passed through a sieve. Add 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, in little 
bits, and turn into a tureen over half 
a dozen crackers, split and buttered. 
Salt, a teaspoonful or more, needs be 



added also, for some tastes, a tea- 
spoonful of mixed thyme and summer 
savory, a sprig of parsley, and part of 
a bay leaf. 

Sponge Cake 

Beat the yolks of five eggs until light- 
colored and thick. Gradually beat in 
one cup of granulated sugar, then the 
grated rind and juice of half a lemon. 
Beat the whites of five eggs dry. "Cut 
and fold" a part of the whites into the 
first mixture, then "cut and fold in" 
half a cup of flour, the other half of 
the whites, and, lastly, the other half 
of the flour. Bake in a tube pan be- 
tween forty and fifty minutes. 

Curdling of Milk with Irish Moss 

In one hundred parts of Iceland or 
Irish moss there are six and three- 
tenths parts of acids and similar bodies. 
These acids cause milk to curdle when 
the moss is used in making blanc- 
mange. In the sea-moss farine, which 
is sold in packages, a part of this acid 
is lost in the manufacturing process. 

Halibut in Fish Pudding (March, 

1904, Magazine) 

The halibut in the recipe referred to 
was uncooked. 

Panada 

Properly, panada is a preparation 
of bread. The bread is soaked and 
flavored with broth or stock (flavored 
broth), milk, or cream. Formerly but- 
ter and the udder of veal were used for 
this purpose. The crumb of the bread 
only is used. When stock or milk is 
plentiful, the crumb pressed through a 
colander may be put at once into the 
liquid, and, when well softened, be put 
to cook over the fire. Stir continu- 
ously while the preparation cooks to a 
smooth thick paste. Remove from the 
fire, and beat in one or more eggs. If 
the preparation is to be kept white for 
use in a white dish, add only whites of

eggs. At least a full cup of bread and 
more than one cup of milk are needed, 
to make half a cup of panada. One 
beaten egg is usually added to each 
cup of panada while hot. Panada is 
also made of flour. 

Flour Panada 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in 
half a cup of boiling water or stock, 
and stir in half a cup of sifted flour. 
Continue stirring, until the mixture 
leaves the sides of the pan. Remove 
from the fire, and beat in one raw egg. 
This makes a cup of panada.

"Recipes for pineapple filling for layer cake, 
Dutch apple cake, and penuchie made of

Pineapple Filling 

Simmer fresh grated or canned 
(grated) pineapple until reduced a 
little. To each cup of pulp add two- 
thirds a cup of sugar, the grated rind 
and juice of half a lemon, and cook to 
a marmalade. When cool, spread be- 
tween layers of cake. This also makes 
a good sandwich filling, when a sweet 
variety of sandwich is in order. 

Dutch Apple Cake (Yeast) 

Lay a piece of zwieback dough, rolled 
out an inch in thickness, and cut to 
fit the pan, into a buttered pan. Press 
quarters of apples into the top of the 
dough at equal distances one from an- 
other. Sprinkle the whole with sugar 
and cinnamon mixed together. Let 
stand until light, then bake about 
twenty-five minutes. Serve with cream 
or butter and sugar. Sprinkle the apple 
with lemon juice, to avoid its discoloring. 

Dutch Apple Cake 

Mix two cups of flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of 
soda, and two level teaspoonfuls of 
cream of tartar with one-fourth a cup

scant cup of milk, then stir this into 
the dry ingredients. The dough needs 
be soft enough to spread in a shallow 
baking-pan. Have ready, pared, cored,

Rolled Crackers, Crumbs, etc. 

When referring to "crackers, rolled 
fine," we mean an ordinary, plain 
cracker, usually sold by the barrel. 
Such crackers can be split in halves. 
Two of these, rolled fine, make one- 
fourth a cup of crumbs. 

Scalloped Oysters 

Stir one cup of fine bread crumbs 
(not dry, but centre of loaf) and one 
cup of cracker crumbs into melted but- 
ter, using from one-half to two-thirds 
a cup of butter. Pour half a cup of 
cold water over a quart of oysters in 
a sieve, and examine each one care- 
fully to remove any bits of shell. Put 
a thin layer of the buttered crumbs in 
a shallow baking-dish, and above these 
dispose a layer of oysters. Season 
with salt and pepper, and add, as suits 
the taste, a grating of nutmeg, a table- 
spoonful of sherry wine, half a table- 
spoonful of anchovy essence, or a little 
f your favorite sauce. Cover with a 



thin layer of crumbs. Then alternate 
the layers of oysters and crumbs until 
the ingredients are used. Have the last 
layer of crumbs. If a moister dish be 
preferred, use a second cup of bread 
crumbs, and moisten the two middle 
layers of oysters with two or more 
tablespoonfuls of the oyster liquor. 

Baking Pumpkin Pie 

The problem of baking properly the 
undercrust of custard, pumpkin, and 
similar pies without overbaking the 
filling, is as old as pie-baking. Prob- 
ably no cook makes an unqualified suc- 
cess of these points every time. A 
pumpkin or squash pie, in which cracker 
crumbs are used in the place of eggs, 
may be baked in quite a hot oven. 
When eggs are to be used, try lining the 
plate with pastry a day in advance. 
The crusting over of the pastry makes 
it less absorbent, and dry pastry will 
bake better than that soaked with 
liquid from the filling. Pies of the 
kind referred to may often be baked 
to advantage with strong heat when 
first put into the oven, if the heat be 
lowered before the filling begins to 
bubble. By this means the crust is 
baked considerably before the filling is 
heated through.

Every one knows that Royal Baking Powder 
is absolutely pure. Hence the housewife uses it 
with implicit confidence and without question, and 
she is justified in so doing. 

But how few realize that Royal Baking Powder 
in its chief ingredient is a direct product of the health- 
ful and delicious grape! This constituent of the 
grape, crystallized and ground to an impalpable pow- 
der, is the cream of tartar which forms the active 
principle of every pound of Royal Baking Powder. 

Fruit properties are indispensable to the 
healthfulness of the body, and those of the grape 
as used in the "Royal** are the most valuable and 
healthful of all.

Too Well Fed 

Clergyman not Entirely Sure on that Point 

There is an inclination, among the 
ladies, to rather overfeed the Dominie 
sometimes; and, while that indirectly 
helps the sale of Grape-nuts, it offers 
no suitable excuse for the makers to 
encourage the practice. 

A minister of Auburn, Ind., writes: 
"Whether it was from irregular habits 
and more or less badly prepared food 
taken during some of my travels, or 
whether I have been too well cared for 
by my parishioners, does not seem en- 
tirely clear. However, the fact remains 
that indigestion set in, and, after a 
period of hard work, I came down with 
a genuine case of nervous prostration. 

"It seems the trouble had been brew- 
ing for some years, for several insurance 
companies had rejected me after care- 
ful examination by their physicians. 

"I was urged to adopt Grape-nuts 
and cream for my sole diet for break- 
fast and lunch. The request was urged 
so strongly that I concluded to follow 
the suggestion, and, to my surprise, 
began to gain quickly in health and 
strength. 

"I persisted in the use of this re- 
markable food, and a wonderful result 
followed. I have entirely regained my 
health, have been examined by the

Lowney's Cocoa is not like other cocoas, it is better. The flavor is better — 
full and delicious. It is absolutely a natural product; no " treatment" with alka- 
lies or other chemicals in order to cheapen the process of making. No adulteration 
with flour, starch or ground cocoa shells or coloring matter — nothing but the nutri- 
tive and digestible product of the choicest Cocoa Beans. A trial will show what it is.

"Recipe for genuine Boston brown bread." 

Boston Brown Bread 
Pass through a sieve, together, one 
cup, each,' of rye and yellow corn-meal, 
one cup of wheat flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, and two level teaspoonfuls of 
soda. Add two-thirds a cup of mo- 
lasses and two cups of thick sour 
milk. Beat thoroughly, and steam in 
a buttered mould three or four hours. 
Replenish the steamer with boiling 
water as needed. An ordinary steamer, 
filled with water to the trivet on which 
the mould of bread stands, will need no 
replenishing. This bread, steamed four 
hours or resteamed a second day, is dry 
and wholesome. Cover the mould dur-

■ The Woman who Spends. By Bertha 
June Richardson. Cloth, pp. 150. 
Price $j net. Postage, 6 cents. Bos- 
ton: Whitcomb & Barrows. 
This is a study of woman's economic 
function. The book comprises six 
chapters; namely, Sight and Vision, 
Vital Needs, Imitation vs. Indepen- 
dence, Choice, Satisfaction, Responsi- 
bility. The papers are brief and yet 
comprehensive. The point of view is 
modern, and in full harmony with the 
social, altruistic spirit of the times. 
It is the most satisfactory treatment 
or discussion of woman's relation to 
the economic problems of the day it 
has been our privilege to read. And 
is there not truth in the following re- 
mark of the author: "Woman's success 
with the problems which the multiplied 
demands and increased responsibilities 
of life have brought will depend on her 
understanding of them, her honest 
effort to meet conditions with the best 
equipment, and upon her readiness to 



adapt herself and her methods to the 
present." 

Falaise op the Blessed Voice. By 

William Stearns Davis. Cloth. i2tno. 

Price $1.50. New York: The Mac- 

millan Co. 

This is an historical romance, a tale 
of the youth of Saint Louis, king of 
France, and his beautiful queen, Mar- 
garet of Provence. A blind girl, Fa- 
laise of the blessed voice, is made to 
play a conspicuous and fascinating 
part in the narrative. She is the good 
angel, whose magic hand traces the 
guiding thread through the maze and 
labyrinth of a deep-laid plot against 
the prince, — 

"Who reverenced his conscience as his king; 
Whose glory was redressing human wrong ; 
Who loved one only, and who clave to her." 

The story is rich in description, not 
lacking in exciting incident, and of sur- 
passing interest. As it was said of a

The Printing Art. Edited by Henry

The University Press. 

The distinctive make-up of The 
Printing Art, in which are shown com- 
plete examples of color printing, book 
illustration, typography, and commer- 
cial forms, offers an especially rich 
showing in the November issue. This 
is a book number, containing full-page 
illustrations in color, mounted effec- 
tively upon suitable backgrounds, dis- 
plays of title-pages, and typographic 
styles of this season's publications. 
The magazine is printed in colors 
throughout, constituting a rich and 
attractive publication, aside from its 
importance to every one concerned in 
illustration, publishing, printing, and 
allied arts. The Printing Art is issued 
by the University Press, Cambridge, 
Mass. 

This is a unique publication. It 
shows, each month, all the latest de- 
signs in paper, typography, color 
effects, and styles that are known to 
the printer's art. In taste and exe- 
cution it is far superior to anything of 
the kind that has been yet attempted. 
Each issue is a good long lesson in art, 
— the great art of printing and book- 
making.

The book is intended to be a trust- 
worthy guide to those who have to 
give first treatment in cases of acci- 
dent, or to care for the sick at times 
or in places in which skilled medical 
or surgical aid cannot be had. The au- 
thor points out the way in which the 
book should be used. "Let it be read 
over, at least once, as carefully and 
as studiously as possible, so that the 
reader may make the acquaintance 
of the suggestions; and then let it be 
kept in some handy place, where it 
can be referred to immediately when 
an emergency arises." 

Whoever desires to know how to 
act in the presence of an accident or 
emergency, for which one must be 
prepared before it arises, will find this 
little volume eminently satisfactory 
and valuable. 

Thb Table. By Mary W. Alexander. 

Illustrated. Cloth. $1.25 net. New 

York : D. Appleton & Co. 

"The Table and How to Decorate 
it in Every Season and on All Occa- 
sions" might be the full title of this 
attractive little book. The various 
ways and means of setting and deco- 
rating tables, from the simple to the 
most elaborate in design, herein de- 
scribed, should suffice to satisfy the 
tastes of the most fastidious; and yet 
simplicity and inexpensive material, 
adapted to secure pretty results, re- 
ceive the approval of the author. 
Those who wish to entertain and are 
seeking new ideas will find the hints 
and suggestions in this volume welcome 
indeed. The illustrations, of which 
there are many, were taken, by courtesy, 
from the Ladies' Home Journal. Thus 
many a decorated table can be seen 
and studied. 

Teddie was in a hurry for dinner, 
and did not wash his face thoroughly. 
When asked if he called that washing 
his face, he said: "Of course I do. I 
did wash my face, but I didn't think 
it necessary to go into details."

The Pie Libel 

A piece of pie is not necessarily a 
death-warrant. It depends on what 
it is made of and how made. Pie 
proper should represent an unobjec- 
tionable combination of fruit and bread. 

The word "pastry," however, covers 
a multitude of dietetic sins. Flour and 
fat rolled into a couple of soggy layers, 
between which spiced meats chopped 
with more fat, mingled with raisins and 
other fruits, and moistened with cog- 
nacs, — this may be pastry, but it is a 
libel on pie. 

A crust made reasonably tender with 
sweet cream, olive oil, or fresh butter, 
or with half butter and half beef-suet 
(the soft variety), with sufficient bak- 
ing powder or cream of tartar and soda 
to make it light and porous, filled with 
good, wholesome fruit or berries, — this 
is pie; and it is quite as digestible 
and harmless as the ordinary baker's 
loaf. 

It is time the pie libel was relegated 
to the Umbo of other lies. — Dietetic and 
Hygienic Gazette.

Joseph Chamberlain tells this joke on 
himself, says the New York Times. 
He was the guest of honor at a dinner 
in Liverpool. The mayor had invited 
a distinguished company to hear Mr. 
Chamberlain speak. For two hours 
they chatted over their food, and at 
last coffee was served. The mayor 
leaned over, and touched his guest's 
elbow. "Your Excellency," he asked, 
"shall we let the crowd enjoy itself a 
little longer, or had we better have your 
speech now?" 

The late Bishop Dudley of Kentucky 
made friends with the guide on a hunt- 
ing expedition near Louisville, and they 
became quite intimate. After some 
good times together the guide asked, 
"Say, Dudley, what business do you 
follow?" "I am a preacher," "Oh, 
get out! What are you giving me!" 
"But I am. I preach every Sunday 
in Louisville." "Well." said the guide, 
"you ain't stuck up like the preachers 
our way." And he accepted an in- 
vitation to hear his new friend preach 
the next Sunday. After the service 
the bishop greeted him as familiarly 
as in the woods, and asked him how 
he liked it. The guide hesitated for 
a minute, then said, "Well, I ain't 
much of a judge of this kind of thing, 
parson, but I riz with you and sot 
with you, and saw the thing through the 
best I know how; but all the same, if 
my opinion is wuth anything to you, 
the Lord meant you for a shooier!"

Just hear how the bells are ringing ! 
What glad surprises, what joy, what mirth, 
May your bright, changeful months not be bringing ! 

Yes, we know they may bring sorrow and pain ; 
But why should we look for sadness ? 
Men delve in mines for treasures, not stones. 
Why not peer in the future for gladness? 

For whatever we look for, that we find,

A Trip to the Azores

TIME was when the Azores

people, and a person must 
have been brave indeed to have vent-

packets for a visit to the Azores. 

To-day, with the excellent service 
given by several lines of steamships, 
dangers are at a minimum, and the 
pleasures of an ocean trip are much 
enhanced by a stop at the Azores. 

The traveler bound for the Old 
World has only left the New World five 
days behind when the word goes 
round that land is in sight, and he can 
see the "Blessed Isles." 

These are nine in number, covering 
about four hundred geographical miles, 
situated in the latitude of Philadelphia. 
Their trend is from east to west, vol- 
canic in nature, the backbone of each 
island being a range of irregular, cone- 
shaped mountains, covered to their 
tops with verdure and separated into 
plots by lava walls and rows of broom 
plant, — the same plant from which the 
Plantagenet family took its name, — 
giving the landscape a distinctly Japa- 
nese aspect. These islands have given 
rise to much Speculation as to their 
origin. Of late it has been proven that 
they are peaks of a submarine vol- 
canic range of mountains extending 



from the north of Ireland to the ex- 
treme south. 

The Azores are often thought to be 
the remnants of the old "Atlantis" 
mentioned by Plato, and said to have 
been sunk in a single day and night. 
Tradition has it that the inhabitants 
had grown so wicked and become, 
through occult study, so adept in con- 
trol of nature that, like Joshua, the 
son of Nun, they could make the sun 
and moon and stars stand still. 

To the voyager the first sign of land 
is a silvery bank of clouds resting on 
the horizon, which, as you approach, 
gradually enlarges into the tapering 
cone of Pico, sloping upward in fault- 
less lines from the blue sea to the 
height of seven thousand six hundred 
and thirteen feet. Nearer approach 
reveals a succession of terraced hills, 
covered with green verdure, little vil- 
lages nestling at their feet, white- 
washed walls with thatched or red- 
tiled roofs, and Pico clear cut against 
the sky as a background. This is said 
to be the most beautiful volcano in the 
world, Mount Rainier in Washington 
and the famous Japanese Fusiyama 
being close seconds. 

Surprise gives way to admiration 
and interest as the quaint village of 
Horta is seen five miles away on the

island of Fayal, and then the islands 
of Graciosa, San Jorge, and Terceira 
loom up in the distance. At day- 
break on the following day St. Mi- 



to the city is made in small boats 
manned by blue-clad, picturesque, bare- 
footed Portuguese. Our attention is 
first attracted to the handsome Moor- 



Matriz Church and Clock Tower 



chad's is in view, and here we are to 
remain for a brief period. 

The island of St. Michael's is the 
largest and most important of the 
group. It is thirty-seven miles long, 
and has a climate second to none in 
the world, with a range of temperature 
from fifty- four in winter to eighty- 
eight in summer. Bach month brings 
its special flowers and fruits. 

The principal town, Ponta Delgada, 
is hidden from view until you are 
abreast of the breakwater. A city of 
some twenty-eight thousand souls, all 
of whom are housed in picturesque 
casas of pink, white, and blue tiles 
and whitewash, stretching along the 
shore for a distance of three miles. 
If the weather is pleasant, large 
steamers anchor at the end of the 
breakwater. If inclement, they go 
within. In either case the approach 



ish gateway giving entrance to the 
city, and the arched colonnade on the 
quay, this latter being the delight and 
despair, too, of artists, as no brush 
can do justice to brilliant sunlight and 
the shifting shadows made within. 

Ponta Delgada is found by the tour- 
ist to be distinctly a Portuguese city 
of the Middle Ages, — quaint, pictur- 
esque, clean, and with well-made streets. 
It is a rambling old town, the kind 
that people in search of rest and health 
delight to find. 

The attractionsof the town are many. 
Among these are a public square, where 
an excellent regimental band discourses 
the finest music, a magnificent free 
hospital supplied with the latest equip- 
ments for delicate surgery, a castle 
and fort overlooking the harbor, quaint 
prafd for provisions, where one dickers 
over a penny as if it were a dollar,

churches many, and a fine theatre, 
where in season are heard the best 
troupes from Lisbon. 

Here in St. Michael's are to be found 
quaint customs abandoned ages ago 
on the Continent. 

Caste still remains as firmly fixed as 
in some mediaeval romance. There is 
no stepping over the line of demarca- 
tion, and, what is better, apparently 
no desire to do so. The higher class is 
distinctly a leisure class, cultured and 
refined, many having added to their 
culture by travel and study in foreign 
lands. 

There is a saying that a Portuguese 
lady ought to go out but three times 
in her life, — when she is christened, 
married, and buried. The girls are 
carefully educated at home. They are 
rarely seen upon the streets, and sel- 
dom alone. Courting is done from 
verandas and windows, the young 



for the hand of their daughter, and 
then he is never alone with her until 
the ceremony of marriage. 

Being a Catholic country, divorces 
are unknown and separations extremely 
rare. 

When it is said a Portuguese lady 
must go out but thrice in her life, one 
thinks instinctively of old Moorish 
days and the absence of social life. 
But it is not so here. There is a con- 
stant round of ceremonial and social 
calls, and evening after evening the 
different families entertain at what is 
called serocs. These are informal even- 
ing parties spent at cards, in conversa- 
tion, and with music, light refreshments 
being served. As a rule, at ten a 
maid brings in a large tray containing 
cups of black and green tea. She is 
followed by other maids bearing sim- 
ilar trays, one containing plates of all 
kinds of sandwiches, and others with 



A i or ran Peasants 



swain standing beneath in the street 
for hours, looking and saying what all 
lovers say ; but he is never allowed in the 
house until he enters to ask the parents 



every kind of Portuguese sweet cakes 
and candies. Later in the evening 
wines and cakes are served again. 
Occasionally large balls are given.

and at carnival time all is gayety. 
Then the Portuguese senhora is seen 
in all her beauty. 

Being a port on the high seas, 
many men-of-war call, — Russian, Ger- 
man, English, French, American, 
Greek, Brazilian, Spanish, — not to men- 
tion many beautiful yachts. Dances, 
luncheons, dinners, and other forms of 
entertainment often take place on 
these; and somehow there is a charm 
elusive, which quite defies the pen to 
describe, in being entertained on a 
battleship. The gathering on the quay 
of daintily-clad women and distin- 
guished-looking men, the short ride in 
the launch, and the entertainment on 
board afford novel excitement, indeed. 

One of our latest entertainments was 
to a dijeuner on board a beautiful 
yacht. The owner, noted for his 
world-wide enterprises and great abil- 
ities, met us on the quay with his 
guests. A ride of a few moments in 
an electric launch brought us to the 



yacht, a dream of beauty, with her 
clean-cut lines, scrupulous cleanliness, 
and rich decorations. After a brief 
half -hour, seated in most luxurious 
chairs under a canopied deck, we were 
escorted to dejeuner. The table was 
laid for seven. As the name of the 
yacht has not been stated, it may not 
be transgressing the laws of hospitality 
to give the menu: —

A lose k ]'Am£ricaine. 

Bifteck grille* Mattre d'Hotel. 

Asperges Froides Vinaigrette. 

Souffle* k la Vanille.

The melons were from Colorado, the 
fruits from California, a tray laden with 
every kind. After dijeuner our host 
conducted an inspection of the yacht. 
Words are inadequate to describe the 
luxurious fittings and decorations, and 
our woman's envy was especially 
aroused by the beautiful bed-spreads 
and dresser covers. These were all in 
Venetian point lace, that exquisite 
blending of small irregular pieces of 
embroidered linen and point lace. 
Even the animals on board were lux- 
uriously kept; and, when we were 
shown that by pressing a button the 
cows, fine Jerseys, were milked by an 
electrical arrangement attached to the 
udder, it seemed as if science has left 
little yet to do.

At three o'clock we said good-bye, 
the owner of the yacht promising to 
cable if he made record time to Havre. 
Later we received a despatch that the 
voyage was made in three days and 
nine hours, — a record breaker. 

To the peasant class of the islands 
belongs the distinction of keeping up 
the quaint old religious customs, which 
are the source of their chief pleasures. 
They have frequent processions of a 
religious nature, the "Holy Ghost" 
procession, perhaps, being their fa- 
vorite. In this a young girl or boy is 
crowned king or queen, and many chil- 
dren take part. Each side street has 
its own Holy Ghost procession during 
the year. Bread, wine, and meat, all 
blessed by the priest, are carried through 
the streets in gayly decorated oxcarts, 
and distributed to the poor. There is 
always great rivalry between the 
streets to have their children the best 
dressed, their street the most beauti- 
fully decorated with flags and lanterns, 
and their procession the finest. There 
are holy processions during Lent, end- 
ing with three days of most solemn 
mourning, the most realistic removal 
of our crucified Saviour from the cross 
on Good Friday with the quaint Easter 
observances following. 

Then, too, in May is the famous and 



Capote worn by Middle Class 

much venerated "Santo Christo" pro- 
cession, to which many come from all 
parts, even from America. 

These are the chief pleasures of the 
poor. And it certainly speaks well for 
the Azorean people, that their pleasures 
are so closely interwoven with their 
religious life.

Euthenics 

By Helen Louise Johnson 



THE proceedings of the Lake 
Placid Conference on Home 
Economics yearly attract more 
attention from the outside world. The 
purpose of this conference is to further 
the scientific and sociologic study of the 
home by concentrating the best thought 
of leading workers along special lines, 
in order that the discussions of each 
year may count as distinct progress in 
some part of the field. It is signifi- 
cant of the aim of those who make up 
this conference that they are more in- 
terested in the direction in which they 
are moving than in the place in which 
they stand. The sixth annual meet- 
ing, held at the Iroquois branch of the 
Lake Placid Club late in September, 
was largely devoted to discussions of the 
educational side of the subject as pre- 
sented in the colleges, schools, and 
women's clubs of this country and Eng- 
land. An important suggestion was 
to take pattern of the successful work 
done by Miss Ravenhill in England, 
and make hygiene more prominent as 
the basis of domestic science in the 
schools. To the teacher, however, no 
suggestion will be more welcome than 
that for the nomenclature of the vari- 
ous divisions of the work, under the 
generic title of euthenics. 

It is always a matter of interest when 
the English language is enriched by the 
birth of a new word. The word "eu- 
thenics" seems to fill a long-felt want, 
being particularly expressive of the 
definite aims of this special branch 
of education. Francis Galton's * 'eu- 
genics," right environment, and Mrs. 
Richards's "eu themes," right living, 
indicate the progress we are making 
toward a higher plane of life, a prog- 
ress which demands fitting words in 
which to express certain stages of 
growth. 



Euthenics, right living, the fourth 
"R" to complete the quadrivium of the 
present-day education. Within how 
many years is it that the most ele- 
mentary knowledge of the rudiments 
of learning was considered sufficient for 
any girl? The three "R's": reading, 
that she might learn of the deeds of 
man; writing, that she might praise 
them; arithmetic, that she might not 
waste his substance; but now, with the 
fourth "R," has she not come into her 
rightful inheritance? Not the right to 
vote, man forbid ! nor the open sesame 
into the land of science that was given 
long ago, Jaut the greatest of all great 
things, the knowledge of right living. 

The schools for many years have 
taught formal English grammar, but 
now they have begun to recognize the 
necessity for teaching the use of it. 
It was formerly the function of the 
school to supplement home training, 
now it must supply it. The students 
of social movements, who are appre- 
hensive of the present-day tendencies, 
which draw men more and more in the 
direction of commercialism, and women 
into industrialism, to the detriment of 
home and family life, are looking with 
hope to the growth of these subjects, 
heretofore grouped as home economics, 
domestic science, and the like in the 
schools. There is a growing convic- 
tion that, as the universities take cog- 
nizance of the future activities of their 
men students, it is fitting they should 
make similar provision for the training 
of women. 

Cooking has been taught in the 
schools, the subject of home economics 
taken up by the club women, and 
courses in domestic science given in 
various places; but to the uninitiated 
only one of these terms conveyed its 
real or entire meaning. The nomen- 



Euthenics 



291 



clature suggested by the conference is 
as follows : hand -work in the elementary 
grades, where simple cooking, clean- 
ing, weaving, and like processes are 
taught; domestic science in the sec- 
ondary school, where the subject has 
its foundation in and becomes allied 
to various sciences; economics, with- 
out prefix, in normal and professional 
work; and euthenics in the college and 
university courses. Should this no- 
menclature be universally adopted, 
there is no doubt it will do much in 
clearing away the mist of popular mis- 
understanding from these subjects. 

It will be noted that the members of 
the Lake Placid Conference have at 
last determined to lay claim to their 
own. Economics means the law of 
the home, and social and political econ- 
omists usurped the word when they 
took possession of it long ago. There 
is a present tendency to give to social 
and political economy their full titles. 
Hence the time seems to have come 
when the subject of economics may 
assume its proper name, without the 
redundancy formerly used for the pur- 
pose of explanation. Definition is the 
kernel of education, and the use of the 
best word to express his meaning is 
the hall-mark of the cultivated man. 
The terms "domestic science" and 
"home economics " defy concise defini- 
tion, especially when the latter term is 
misunderstood as related solely to econ- 
omy in the house. 

Years ago Ruskin wrote: "We have 
warped the word ' economy ' in our Eng- 
lish language into a meaning which it 
has no business to bear. In our use 
of it, it constantly signifies merely sav- 
ing or spending. Economy no more 
means saving money than it means 
spending money. It means the ad- 
ministration of a house, its steward- 
ship, spending or saving money or 
time or anything else to the best possi- 
ble advantage." 

The spending or saving money, time, 



or anything else to the best possible 
advantage, implies a knowledge of rela- 
tive values, a knowledge fundamental 
to the science of right living. It is not 
alone the question, With a given income 
on what should money be spent or 
where saved without too great an ex- 
penditure of strength or time? but 
standards of good or ill and an under- 
standing of what constitutes success 
are involved. 

Within recent years the students of 
contemporary social conditions have 
begun to view with alarm certain 
tendencies, signs of an unrest which is 
pregnant of great changes. Some years 
ago Professor Huxley said, "Even the 
best of modern civilization appears to 
me to exhibit a condition of mankind 
which neither embodies any worthy 
ideal nor even possesses the merit of 
stability." In our large cities there is 
a manner of living in vogue which 
leads to a physical or moral deteriora- 
tion. The standard of living is so ex- 
travagant and the competition so 
great that the men or women who de- 
sire to retain high ideals are pushed 
aside unconsidered as factors in the 
race. Competition is one of the most 
beneficent as well as one of the great- 
est forces in the world. Rivalry may 
easily degenerate into one of the worst. 
This comes when one sets a wrong 
valuation on things. To value sensa- 
tion more than the attainment of ideals, 
to regard outward show as the indica- 
tion of true worth, to measure success 
by its rewards rather than by the suc- 
cess itself, to believe that life consists 
in living as or better than the next 
man does, — this is in truth to become 
as the prodigal, and exist on husks. 

This, however, is what is to be seen 
on every side; and to-day no more 
Herculean task is given to the teacher 
of economics than the preaching of the 
gospel of right living. For this money- 
spending, sensational, restless living 
is not confined to the rich, but it has

crept into the homes of the backbone 
of the country, to the so-called middle 
class. The poor try to rival their 
betters, the betters to live like the 
well-to-do, the well-to-do copy the rich, 
and the rich ape the manners and cus- 
toms of the multi-millionaires, all 
seemingly unconscious of the utterly 
wrong values they are attaching to 
mere outward things. 

Good and evil have come to be meas- 
ured as external facts, not as inward 
conditions. It is good to be success- 
ful, it is evil to fail; but in what does 
failure or success consist? Certainly 
not according to the social measurement 
of the day, in the possession of many 
things. This multiplication of ap- 
parent needs and desires far beyond 
present means is the outcome, ordi- 
narily, of trying to live as the other 
man does. This means an utter lack 
of freedom, and success in it is bought 
so often at a fearful price, — bought by 
the barter of ideals, character, and 
purpose. Years ago at Dartmouth 
College, Emerson spoke these words : — 
"When you shall say: 'As others do, 
so will I : I renounce, I am sorry for it, 
my early visions; I must eat the good 
of the land, and let learning and ro- 
mantic expectations go until a more 
convenient season'; then dies the 
man in you, then once more perish 
the buds of art and poetry and science, 
as they have died already in a thou- 
sand, thousand men. The hour of 
that choice is the crisis of your history, 
and see that you hold yourself fast by 
the intellect." 

Women, no less than men, are led 
astray by social ambitions, and, per- 
haps, are more bound to the fetich of 
custom and convention, held in worse 
bondage by mere things. The tempta- 
tion to worship our neighbors' tin gods 
comes with an ever-increasing force, 
and it takes courage to withstand. 

To teach right living, what courage, 
what nobility of purpose, what high 



ideals, what steadfastness, it entails! 
The teachers of domestic science might 
dodge this issue: the teachers of eu- 
thenics cannot. 

Right living indicates freedom, — a 
freedom of health, of efficiency, of op- 
portunity. The whole intention of 
physical life is to give means of expres- 
sion to the soul within; but that soul 
is an individual soul, has its own 
heaven to make, and should not be 
"helled" in by the foolish customs and 
opinions of others. In order that the 
body may express the soul, it must 
have freedom, — a freedom of health, 
of efficiency, of opportunity. Health is 
the first expression of right living: it 
may be purchased and held at no other 
price. Efficiency comes not alone 
through education, but it implies free- 
dom from unnecessary things. Oppor- 
tunity means freedom from useless con- 
ventions; but this does not mean the 
gentle amenities, the real courtesies, 
nor even, at times, the mannerisms of 
the day. It does mean that scale 
which measures action by an arti- 
ficial social standard. That is, by the 
present social code extant in some 
places a woman gains in the esteem of 
the world by going into the slums and 
battling with the dirt there; but she 
would have to do her own laundry work 
in the dead of the night to keep her 
social standing in the Bridge Whist 
Club. She may without loss of caste 
do the work in the front of the house, 
but she has to be possessed of Spartan 
virtues, to deliberately decide to do the 
cooking when a good cook is not to be 
found. It takes far more skill to cook 
a palatable meal than to dust the 
house, and what courage! 

To teach relative values, to appre- 
ciate where time, money, and strength 
should be expended and where saved, 
is one of the largest parts of the fourth 
1 ' R." All the time, money, and strength 
that can be expended, to give life to the 
body, to fit it as the temple of the soul.

to give it freedom for self-expression; 
only that time, strength, and money 
needed to be spent, in providing fitting 
surroundings in material things, — these 
are true values. 

There is in America to-day a noted 
preacher of wholesome living. His 
teaching has been called the gospel of 
sweetness, — a sweetness indicative of 
and arising from true, healthy living. 
His words have seemed to find response 
in many hearts, because so many are 
longing for the simple life, — a life not 



destitute of the duties, responsibilities, 
and privileges which life in any home 
is sure to bring, but from which the 
rubbish of useless convention, the un- 
rest and reckless hurry, the over- 
valuing of petty, trivial, unsatisfying 
things, have been swept away. The 
majority of women need, as they want, 
time in which to revisit the well-springs 
of peace and joy and full content ; and, 
because they want it, they must gain 
it by learning to seek and to value the 
right things. 



Faithful Failures 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



IT was just a kind of co-operative 
home in which lived a few women • 
(the serenest one among them serv- 
ing as house-mother), a sewing teacher, 
a seamstress, a stenographer and type- 
writer, a book-keeper, and two or 
three saleswomen having cast their lot 
together as an experiment. Some 
who began with them had left, life 
being too ethical and food too cereal, 
as they alleged. Others had taken 
their places, and expenses had been met. 
Now on New Year's night they al- 
lowed themselves the luxury of an 
open fire and reminiscences. The New 
Year meant no change in work for 
them, though they were too grateful 
for any employment to call it drudgery. 
But was life to go on in the same way, 
always being punctual at work to es- 
cape fines, always counting the cost of 
anything before buying it, always 
twisting and turning something to eke 
out the Christmas gifts for each other, 
fun as it was to do it compared with 
not doing anything! What were they 
to do with the perpetual dread before 
them of old age without work, annuity, 
or dividends, though it was a rule of 



the house that each one should yearly 
lay aside one-tenth of her earnings 
against the bankruptcy of age? Yet 
even such savings could not guarantee 
them comfort in their future disabilities. 

As they talked of disappointed am- 
bitions, the house-mother wondered if 
they would ever rise into nobler ac- 
ceptance of limitations. Bach had so 
craved personal success, several had so 
rejected marriage, lest it should mean 
the thraldom of economic housekeep- 
ing, that it was long before any of 
them had learned to enjoy the work of 
self-support just for the sake of doing 
it well in nooks and by-corners of in- 
dustry. 

"I am so tired of hearing of 'the 
simple life/ " said the seamstress, whose 
days were spent in sewing seed pearls 
on satin trains. And the cashier at 
the Ladies' Club told of her impatience 
with menus that made plain living a 
rarity. 

"It is philanthropy that is the 
trouble, " objected the philosopher of 
the home. "Instead of good wages 
we have to put up with organizations 
for this, that, and the other thing, with 



*94 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



club life and educational centres for 
homes, with free lectures instead of 
free theatres, and with free sermons 
instead of good times. I am so wea- 
ried with efforts to improve. I don't 
know which is worst, headlong phil- 
anthropy or scientific charity. I only 
know that the heart has gone out of 
organizations, and that methods have 
taken its place.' ' 

"Do you know we once were daugh- 
ters," asked the oldest of the group, 
"and that the chief est fault of some 
of us lies in our leaving our parents to 
fight it out alone on the farm, while 
we come to the city to make a career 
for ourselves ? Shop-girls can dream of 
careers," she added scornfully. "I 
never ought to be a mother, because 
I deserted mine. Economically, too, I 
was at fault. I could not earn enough 
to support myself in the city and send 
home something weekly which would 
equal what it cost in pain to mother 
to live out her life alone. Duties and 
homes go together. I separated them. 
Mother died, father married again and 
so is off my hands, and now my room 
is my home." 

"That's better than saying your 
trunk is your home, as so many girls 
have to do," interposed the house- 
mother. 

"Oh, of course; but, if I have power 
for any mission, it would be to implore 
college graduates and shop-girls not to 
desert their homes, but to take up 
their parents and house and farm work 
as they would causes." 

"You are neither fair to us nor to 
parents," declared the typewriter, who 
had just had an article in a magazine. 
"Our parents glory in our successes. 
Besides, they owe themselves to us ; for 
we never asked for birth. Yet I would 
do for them, as being next of kin, and 
as charity begins at home; but I must 
develop my own life at the same time." 

"Don't, girls,— don't," begged the 
house-mother. "You are unjust all 



round: each of you is better than she 
herself thinks. Each of you has been 
a dear child in the home, and has been 
faithful to the standard she set herself, 
though perhaps often groping blindly 
towards it. It is not well on New 
Year's Day to take account of griev- 
ances or of might-have-beens, but of 
the glories that remain. Everything 
that is might be so much worse. We 
have learned, each of us, that death 
does not bring the only loneliness, and 
that gratitude for its coming is our 
deepest feeling; for the more we love, 
the easier is it to bear death. The 
real, abiding, loneliness is that of dis- 
appointment with ourselves, but even 
that has its bright side. Never give 
up trying, never expect to succeed, 
and then each day's work gets done of 
itself, as we rise out of our selfish selves 
into our best selves. Only don't scorn 
yourselves. A failure, each of us, but 
faithful in our failures. I didn't mean 
to say so much, girls. Only don't be 
cantankerous with yourselves." 

No one answered, and she spoke 
on, almost unconsciously. "The best 
praise ever given to average woman 
was, 'She hath done what she could.' 
Full of mistakes ! Yes, but we are not 
half so merciful to ourselves as God is 
to us, and in this New Year I am not 
going to try to understand myself: it 
is dangerous, pettifogging work. I am 
going to let myself alone, go ahead as 
faithfully as I can, knowing I shall 
write Failure across the last page of 
next year's diary, but trusting that I 
may recross that word with Faithful." 

The girls were still silent awhile, for 
the house-mother had spoken with un- 
usual frankness, and they all knew 
that not one among them had so little 
talent as she for anything else than the 
blessed gift of being sunny-hearted 
and making home happy. At last 
Marie queried tentatively, timorously: 
"Don't you think that perhaps a home 
just of women isn't what it should be, 



The First Snow

that men might be useful adjuncts, 
with furnace, chores, etc., — we might 
have more meat ? Platonic friendships 
could keep inside the danger line, and 
yet give a spice to things; and then, 
girls," she added enthusiastically, "if 
one of us should get married, what 
fun!" 

"But that would break up the 
home!" said the philosopher. 

"Not at all," replied Marie. "The 
first one who marries shall bring her 
husband here. We can be like the 
figures on the new public library doors, 
— one man, all the rest women, a typi- 
cal Boston group. If the two go in 
for the economic independence of each, 
he'lhbe a jolly friend with the rest of 
us, or, if he's just a husband and lets 
her be a lady of leisure, why, still he 
will be a man round. I guess there 
would be just as much faithfulness and 
not so many failures, at the end of the 
year, if, at least, we had more men 
callers." 

Marie had said what each often 
thought. But how could it be done 
respectably? People would talk, yet 
people were made to go in twos. There 
must be some way to do it. College 
settlements would not be so attractive, 
if there were not both men and women 
in them. A home without men, like 
a school without them, lacks the stimu- 
lus of their point of view; and com- 
bined points of view make public 
opinion. 



"Don't you suppose there are just 
as many average men who are faithful 
failures as there are average women?" 
asked the philosopher. 

"Yes," answered Marie, "and they 
need homes more than we do. A 
woman always has her subconscious 
self to keep her company, but a man 
has only himself and his pipe. Sup- 
posing we are all faithful, it would not 
be any harm to have single men in 
our home, if they will stay single; and 
then we shall not mind so much being 
Failures. Let us begin the New Year 
by having a man apply for the next 
vacancy!" 

1 * Agreed !' ' said they all. " And now, 
little house-mother, give us your bless- 
ing, for it is midnight," begged one of 
them. 

"Dear girls," she returned, "you 
don't know how really honest you are 
in thought, how truthful in speech, 
how self-denying in act. The only 
thing you need to learn is to be happy 
even when you can't have things. 
Things are not as real as happiness; 
and, girls, if love comes in your way, 
don't turn it aside because he who 
offers it is homely or commonplace. 
And, if it does not come, still be happy ; 
for, though none of us may ever at- 
tain what we crave, — health, friends, 
skilled workmanship, better wages or 
salaries, success, fame, — we yet, each 
according to our lights, can be Faithful 
Failures." 



The First Snow 

By Jane D. Stone 



I wonder what has happened in the night ? 
For look, dear nurse, the ground is all so white, 
And all the trees and walks and our old swing, 
The statue at the gate, and everything. 



And yesterday it all was wet and brown. 

You say it's snow that God sends fluttering 

down? 
I wonder how he does it ? Oh, I know : 
He pops the rain, and turns it white to snow. 



She of the Golden-lily Feet 



By Jessie Juliet Knox 



SEN TOY was a Chinese maiden 
with "golden-lily feet." Al- 
though the possession of three- 
inch feet has been supposed to make 
life to the Celestial lady all that could 
be desired, yet for all this Sen Toy was 
not happy. The reason for her un- 
happiness lay in the fact, paramount 
to all others with the mind feminine, — 
she was not beautiful; and it seemed 
that no amount of rice paste and rouge 
pads would make her so. Nature had 
not been kind to her, that was all. 
But Sen Toy had such a sweet, gentle 
way and such a tender heart that 
every one loved her; that is, every one 
who knew her. But, of course, she 
could not know very many, as she 
was a maid of high degree, and had 
to stay shut up in her tiny, doll-like 
apartments near the roof, in the vast 
Chinatown of San Francisco, only 
during the brief and blissful season 
of the Chinese New Year, which lasted 
about two weeks. Sen Toy's father 
was a high-binder, of the order of Hip 
Sing Tongs, and with the daughter his 
will was law. 

Something wonderful was going to 
happen to Sen Toy. At least, it had been 
decreed by her father; and this some- 
thing was to happen during the week of 
the[San Nin, or New Year. She had had 
her day-dreams, as all maidens will, and 
had dreamed of a hero who was to be 
handsome and brave, according to Ce- 
lestial ideas. And when her father had 
said to her, "Sen Toy, you going to get 
mallied — velly soon now: I think San 
Nin," the girl was terror-stricken. She 
had been bold enough to dream that 
it would come to her in a different way 
from this, — in a way all love's own; 
and yet she had always had that fear 
that the one she loved would not re- 
turn her feeling, because she was not 



beautiful. But her wary father had 
thought of that, and provided against 
any such contingency. So she fal- 
teringly replied: "No! No! No, Chun 
[father], 1 may not love him. I no 
can . tell. Please let me find him 
myself!" But all her pleading was 
in vain, for the father had spoken. 
What weight could the words of a girl 
have, and how could anything so un- 
worthy as a girl even venture to sug- 
gest an opinion on such a matter? 
It should be sufficient for her to know 
that her father had taken the trouble 
to select a husband for her. "But 
I likee see him," she said; and to that 
the father finally consented, on prom- 
ise that she was not to allow the future 
husband to see her. Sen You, the 
father, kept a restaurant; and the 
bridegroom-elect was to be there that 
night, dining with one of the "Chinese • 
Six Companies." Sen Toy was to be 
peeping from her room when her father 
would give a sign, and by that she would 
know who was the future husband. 

Now Sen Toy had a maid, as do all 
high-caste maidens; but, try as she 
might, the little maid could not make 
her young mistress beautiful. The 
maid, Suey Fong, did not have the 
"golden-lily feet," but she had what 
her mistress would much have pre- 
ferred, and that was a beautiful face, 
sparkling and coquettish, large, vel- 
vety, oblique eyes, willow-leaf eye- 
brows, and mouth like a rich red rose. 
Although her feet were of ordinary 
size, her heart was warm and throb- 
bing; and she eagerly listened to the 
story of her young mistress, feeling 
a sympathy and sorrow for her that 
she was to be forced to marry some 
one who would probably be old and 
ugly and unattractive. 

As the hour drew near, the two 



She of the Golden-lily Feet 



*97 



girls were intensely excited, and kept 
up a constant chattering. What could 
lie be like, this unknown man whose 
slave she was to be the rest of her 
life? Suppose he should be very old. 
She hated old men. Suppose — but 
just then, while peeping through the 
tiny aperture of her door, she saw her 
father give the sign, just as a crowd 
of men seated themselves at the pol- 
ished tables. Could it be possible? 
Was there not some mistake? Surely, 
the gods would not be so good to her. 
This man, to whom her father was 
unmistakably directing her gaze, was 
neither old nor unattractive. On the 
contrary, he was young and strong 
and handsome. He embodied every 
ideal her girlish heart had framed, 
and her innocent soul went out to him ; 
and in that one moment of fleeting 
happiness she was changed from a girl 
to a woman, — a woman with love throb- 
bing through every fibre of her being. 
She would have stood thus gazing 
forever, perhaps, but the little maid 
was all curiosity, and wanted to peep 
at the handsome unknown; but, in 
her curious eagerness, she stumbled, 
and the slight noise attracted the at- 
tention of the handsome young Ah 
Sam. One glance showed him a young 
and tender face, as beautiful as the 
sacred almond blossom and full of 
all love's possibilities and blisses. Can 
it be? he thought, and quickly, turn- 
ing to the father of Sen Toy, he whis- 
pered, "Is that my bride to be?" 
The old high-binder, realizing that 
this was a crucial moment, hurriedly 
replied, "Yes, yes, that my daugh- 
ter, Sen Toy: she velly beautiful." 

"Yes!" gasped the ardent young 
Chinaman, "she velly beautiful," and 
then — the door closed, shutting out 
all the world for the young Ah Sam; 
and, alas that it should be! shutting 
out all the world for the little maid, 
Suey Fong. For her sparkling eyes 
had seen, and her tender heart had 



gone forever from her keeping. It 
was fate. But she must not let 
her young mistress discover the secret. 
No one need ever know. And the 
marriage could take place; and, as 
for herself, she could go away to China 
after the marriage, and never look 
again upon his face. Sen Toy was 
in an ecstasy of bliss after this, and 
the only thing that marred her happi- 
ness was the thought that she was not 
beautiful. And she prayed day and 
night to the paper god on the wall, 
"O good joss, make me beautiful! 
make me beautiful!" . . . The little 
maid Suey no longer prayed to the 
god, for she now had another idol 
in the innermost sanctuary of her heart. 
But no one knew. 

It was now only a few weeks until 
the New Year; and the little maid 
was kept very busy, indeed, execut- 
ing commissions for the bride-elect. 
Being a low-class maid, she was free 
to go and come as she wished. One 
night, when her young mistress had 
retired very early, the sad little maid 
walked through the restaurant, and 
out on to the picturesque balcony, 
sitting down to watch the crowds 
beneath. Her heart was heavy, and 
life had no charms for her. What 
could she do? How hide from the 
world this all-absorbing passion that 
was eating her very soul away? The 
soft light of the great swaying dragon- 
lanterns fell upon her pretty face 
and polished hair as she leaned upon 
the carved railing. Suddenly a warm 
hand touched her little cold one, 
and a soft voice thrilled her heart- 
strings. It was the voice of the man 
she loved, and he was saying: "My 
little wife, poo chu [precious pearl], 
why do you hide from me, when you 
are so beautiful ? Little almond flower, 
look in my eyes, and tell me that you 
love me, and are glad that you belong 
to me!" Her heart stood still. She 
had not thought of this. So he thought 



298 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



she was Sen Toy? She must tell him 
of his mistake. She must — but stay! 
The voice of the tempter whispered 
in her ear: "Why tell him? He loves 
you, and you love him. Why not 
snatch a few happy moments from 
fate, and then you can live upon 
the memory of it all. And so, being 
a woman, she yielded to the voice, and 
looked into his eyes, and allowed her 
cold little hand to stay clasped in his 
big warm one. And Sen Toy slept* 
on, nor dreamed of the shadow that 
had fallen on her life. 

"Why do you tremble so, blossom 
maiden? Are you not mine? Do you 
not love me? Tell me! tell mel" 
And she, faint with the ecstasy of 
this sweet rapture that had come upon 
her, answered: "Yes, it is true. I am 
yours. I do love you, but I — I 
ought to go — some one might come." 

"Well, what of that? You belong 
to me." 

And so the time passed. Every 
night the young maid would wait until 
her young mistress was asleep, and 
then creep out to her stolen bliss, — 
the bliss she must soon renounce for- 
ever. 

She could not tell him yet: it 
was too sweet. She could not give 
him up until the time drew nearer. 
But, at last, came the day before the 
wedding. Sen Toy, as is the Chinese 
custom, sat in her tiny room and wept. 
Not that she was troubled or unhappy. 
Oh, no! it was merely a part of the 
ceremony, that was all; and the thought 
that after to-morrow she would leave 
her father and belong to the family 
of some one else did not disturb her 
in the least. On the contrary, it 
filled her with ecstasy unspeakable. 
All the Chinese forms had been com- 



plied with, and everything was in read- 
iness for the nuptials to-morrow. A 
fortune-teller had been consulted, and 
he had pronounced the birthdays au- 
spicious. Ah Sam's family sent the 
old high-binder a card bearing a dragon, 
and he sent Ah Sam's parents one bear- 
ing the picture of a phoenix, this mut- 
ually assuring them that all was well. 
Indeed, everything had been done. 
No one dreamed of the agony in the 
heart of Suey Fong or of the mo- 
ments of rapture which would come 
to her through it all, when she re- 
membered that, after all, she was the 
one he loved, what matter whom he 
married ? 

Sen Toy was in the seventh heaven 
of bliss! To-morrow she would see 
him ! but, according to Chinese custom, 
she could not raise her veil until after 
the ceremony, and then it would 
be too late for him to change his mind. 
Suey Fong had decided that she 
could not tell him, — she would rather 
die; and so the day of the wedding 
arrived, but not before Suey Fong 
had had her last deadly-sweet meet- 
ing with Ah Sam. He did not know 
it was the last, though, and left her 
surcharged with bliss. He could feel 
the touch of her velvet lips thrilling 
him through all the long hours of the 
night. The little maid, too, was heav- 
ily veiled until after the ceremony, 
and then — 

Opium is a good friend to the Chi- 
nese, sometimes. Sen Toy looked 
almost beautiful after death, and the 
little maid felt a bitter pang of remorse 
as she gazed at her. But she had for- 
gotten remorse, and remembered noth- 
ing but love, when she sailed for China, 
the very next day. For was she not 
with Ah Sam ? 




Vox Populi and the Prophet 

By Helen Campbell 



€C 



W 



HAT shall come next," 
began the Prophet, emerg- 
ing from a brown study, "is 
elimination. That must be, and soon, 
else you die overwhelmed by the menus 
of all nations. That is a thing I study. 
It is well, always well, that one eat 
with the nation where one is. Accept 
the vox populi, and take chili con came 
with the Mexican or the fin of seal with 
the Esquimaux. That is for experi- 
ment, that makes cosmopolitanism; but 
it is for a day, not a lifetime. What 
I consider now is how to sufficiently 
respect the vox populi, yet also defy 
at will; for see! into your America 
pours ever a crowd that each month 
is a new tribe or nation. Out of the 
Caucasus, it may be, or some far point 
of most barbarous Russia, wild peo- 
ples, who will be here to be tamed, 
and, what you will call, 'licked into 
shape.' That is one way that the 
strange dish arrives, and there must be 
market of their own. And another 
way is the historical one, and a roll of 
papyrus, it may be, or an Aztec record ; 
a buried stone even that gives a new 
formula, or, in an Indian tribe, sud- 
denly a tradition crops out, where there 
is an old woman to remember and tell, 
and who makes something of a good- 
ness that is for all the ages. So I dis- 
cover in Mexico last year, and with the 
Mayas (who best of all Mexican tribes 
hold traditions), Aztec sweetmeats, that 
I bring back, but only a little pot ; for 
the old woman wanted not to sell. But 
they should sell. There should be an 
industry for them, save this, that a 
machine must be to stir; for no creat- 
ure that lives, save only old Indian 
woman, would be patient to stir hour 
after hour, hour after hour, till all is 
where her eye tells her perfection has 



come. 



i» 



The Prophet paused, and gazed re- 
flectively at his audience of five, then 
shook his head. 

"A machine," he repeated pensively, 
evidently interiorly convinced that no 
American at present before him had 
faintest capacity for the kind of stir 
described; "but, if I say machine, then 
vanishes something that their method 
has for its heart, and that we destroy, 
as with Navajo blankets that we will 
put our aniline colors in, and so vitiate 
all that color sense that is the weaver's 
by long inheritance. As the English, 
and Americans no less, ruin Turkish 
rugs with their falsities and hasty 
methods, and give false models to the 
Japanese, even so is it we shall spoil 
the strange sweetmeats. If we must 
have them all, why shall it not be as 
they wish who were there when we 
were not, not as we will?" 

The youngest member of the group 
stirred impatiently. 

"Dear Prophet," she said, "I don't 
in the least understand why you will 
not tell us about these sweetmeats." 

"Not tell ! But I tell you as we sit," 
returned the Prophet, astonished. 
"Must there also be the American 
haste for that as in all else you will 
have? What I say is that you may 
know all these things; but, as you 
grow seventy, eighty, who knows but 
a thousand million, all the dishes will 
be known. There will be no more dis- 
covery, and men will then, it may be, 
begin to make simpler all living. It is 
time. There is too much to eat, and 
daily more. But now I tell you, these 
Maya Indians make best of all what, as 
I study, I find to be macedoine of fruits, 
rather than what you call preserves. 
These you would call, it may be, bran- 
died fruits; but they are not as your 
brandied peaches, but done with little

sugar and sometimes honey in its place, 
and often with nuts. What I watch 
in a hacienda, two, three days, is the 
mixing and making; for in one went 
nuts all broken, and with them cocoa- 
nut, guava, and orange. No fruit alone, 
but always a combination, and each 
combination up to thirty or forty. I 
am told to remember always its own 
flavor and its own time to be stirred. 
All is in little bits, boiled with little 
sugar, slowly, slowly, down to a gran- 
ular paste, and then with it aguardi- 
ente, mescal or strong wine, or brandy, 
just enough to preserve it unfermented. 
then in little jars or even a tin, but that 
last is not true way. There is orange, 
pineapple, and pawpaw; but best of 
all is raisins, orange, banana, and 
cocoanut, and on top in the little jar 
aguardiente that keeps it a hundred 
years, if you will." 

"It's nothing in the world but just 
plain fruit butter," said the youngest 
hearer, as she gazed a little indignantly 
into the tiny earthen jar the Prophet 
had suddenly produced. "That is the 
simple Yankee of it." 

"There is no simple Yankee in this 
land of complication," said the Prophet; 
"and your apple butter, for I have 
tasted it, is as mud to this pearl of 
price. Taste, and see. With finger, 
yes, if no spoon is here." 

The spoon had arrived, a series of tiny 
ones ; and each tasted. 

"Delicious," "Elusive," "Straight 
from fairy land," "A conserve for 



angels," — these were the comments 
that went round; and the youngest 
hearer put out her spoon imploringly. 
' ' It's base cruelty to give half a black- 
coffee spoonful of a thing like that 
Can't we make some?" 

The Prophet burst into a laugh 
mellow as his tones, but bent in apology 
even as he laughed. 

"She who is mother of what you eat 
now, and of many jars that hold it, 
stir thirteen hours, and only move a 
little two, three times to rest her. Oh, 
you may laugh; but that is part of the 
secret." 

"I will make as good in four, and 
on the gas stove it can simmer and not 
kill the maker," said the oldest hearer; 
but the Prophet shook his head. 

"You think so, but something would 
lack. What matter when you need it 
not?" 

"But a ravishing thing like that is 
needed. It shall be tried anyway. 
Think how it would puzzle every one 
in a sweet sandwich." 

The Prophet made a gesture of de- 
spair. 

"Sandwich! There is nothing the 
American will not make sandwich. 
Why shall you add a neutral to this 
thing that needs it not, but is pure 
flavor that lingers like jasmine odor? 
It is not for food so much, this one. 
It is for delight. I forbid the sand- 
wich." And he clasped the little pot 
fervently, and with a final, "No, no," 
made his way toward the town. 



Lampreys of Aquitaine 

Translated from the French by Mrs. D. J. Ehricht 



I ONCE knew a charming fellow, who 
was also a great eater and a fine 
"gourmet." Every year, with the 
regularity of clockwork, he would take 



a trip to Bordeaux. What magnet 
attracted him to this charming city? 
A tourist's caprice ? No. An affair of 
business? A family tie? Not at all: 



Lampreys of Aquitaine 



301 



none of these. He went to Bordeaux, 
the rogue, simply to taste a lamprey 
from Gironde served with Aquitaine 
sauce and crawfish butter. Then he 
returned gayly to Paris, his toothpick 
between his lips. 

One day, unfortunately, he had the 
fancy to return by way of P6rigueux. 
There he met with some truffles, and 
courted them in all styles of sauce. 
Once he shut himself up in his room 
with an immense "terrine," fragrant as 
a flower-bed. What happened? The 
next day my friend was found dead 
beside the empty dish. Thus ended 
his pilgrimages to the lampreys of 
Gironde. As a matter of fact, these 
latter might have proved as fatal to 
him as the dish of truffles. Certain 
stomachs cannot stand lampreys. 

Is it not said of Henry I. of Eng- 
land that he died of an indigestion 
caused from eating lamprey? With- 
out being certain that this may not be 
a calumny at the expense of this deli- 
cate fish, we are sure it did not scare 
the English or their subsequent kings. 
There is probably no country where 
this fish is more esteemed than in 
England, where quantities are con- 
sumed and the death-rate of the popu- 
lation does not appear to suffer much. 
The town of Gloucester still has the 
old custom of presenting each year a 
dish of lamprey pasty to the reigning 
queen or king about Christmas time, 
which gift has always been graciously 
accepted and enjoyed by the royal 
family, without much thought about 
the disaster to King Henry. 

But, if the English love lamprey, 
they were not the first to appreciate 
its merits. The old gourmets of Rome, 
who carried the pleasures of the table 
to such an extent, had a special pre- 
dilection for it. At this time the best 
fish came from Sicily, and were caught 
in the straits that separate it from 
Italy. They were also raised artifi- 
cially in special tanks, one of which is 



mentioned as being constructed by 
Hirtius, and in which were kept the 
fish to be consumed at the banquets 
of Julius Caesar. 

But we are straying considerably 
from our terrines of truffles and lam- 
preys of Gironde! Caught in abun- 
dance in Italy, where they are pickled in 
great quantity, lampreys are scarce in 
the north. The fish is delicious stewed 
a I'Angevine. 

Before cooking, scald them to get 
the skin off, which is without scales, 
slick and soft like an eel's. Cut them 
up in pieces, which you steep in salt 
and vinegar for an hour. Then, after 
washing your pieces, you place them 
delicately in an earthen stewpan on 
a bed of sliced onion. Pour-over some 
olive oil and salt and pepper and a 
dozen mushrooms. Moisten with a 
bottle of white wine (Sauterne) and 
four or five tablespoonfuls of old brandy. 
Cover your pot with a deep plate filled 
with water which completely fits, and 
seals hermetically. Then let simmer 
slowly in hot ashes for an hour. Skim 
off the fat, and add a roux with 
plenty of lemon juice, a little red pep- 
per, and some chopped parsley. This 
dish is delicious and a real feast. 

Among other ways of dressing this 
fish, I was about to forget the sauce 
provencale. Take, if you please, some 
neat little slices of lamprey artistically 
marinated and two-thirds cooked in 
aromatic court-bouillon. Then fry 
them delicately brown in olive oil, and 
serve them on a scarlet pur6e of to- 
matoes. 'Tis a charming and delec- 
table dish. 

It is not likely that I would, in 
imitation of my poor defunct friend, 
make a special journey to Bordeaux 
to taste lampreys; but with greedy 
delight I would make a visit to this 
delightfully hospitable city, "the par- 
adise of the palate," according to 
Montaigne, and also the cellar of the 
world. 



Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 



By Mary D. Chambers 
Lesson III. Fish 



TWO classes of fish are studied 
in this lesson, the " white' ' 
and the ' 'red " blooded. These 
may be codfish or halibut for the one 
and bluefish or salmon for the other. 
The class is divided into groups of 
five, every member of the group re- 
ceiving a small portion, from one to 
two ounces, of each kind of fish, 
and employing, for both portions, 
one of five different methods of cook- 
ing; namely, boiling, steaming, baking, 
roasting, or frying. The general effect 
of the various methods employed oh 
the two classes of fish is then compared, 
also the effect of supplementing each 
with one of the typical fish sauces. 
The "variations" are used by alter- 
nate groups, and one or more methods 
of cooking an entire fish, or a quantity 
sufficient to serve six persons, is prac- 
tised by certain students, as the size 
of the class or the amount of the 
appropriation warrants. More fre- 
quently the preparation of the larger 
quantity by one or more individuals 
is reserved for another lesson.' 

At the close of the period, or during 
the recitation hour, charts are studied, 
graphically illustrating the composi- 
tion, edible portion only, of the types 
of fish used, thus throwing light on 
the differences observed in flavor, 
texture, appearance, etc., of the two 
kinds of fish subjected to the same 
methods of cooking. 

To boil Fish 
Lower fish gently into boiling water 
to cover, and allow to simmer six to 
eight minutes to every pound, or until 
cooked. 



Variation. — Acidulate water with 
vinegar, a tablespoonful to a quart of 
water, or further season with carrot, 
onion, bay-leaf, thyme, etc, 

To steam Fish 

Place in steamer, and allow to cook 
eight to ten minutes to a pound, or 
until done. A steamer can be impro- 
vised for a small quantity by placing 
fish in covered strainer over saucepan 
of boiling water. 

Variation. — Season with salt and pep- 
per before placing in steamer, or cover 
with very thin strips of salt pork. 

To bake Fish 

Place, for convenience in lifting out, 
on strips of netting or cheese-cloth 
x>n greased rack in baking-pan. Bake 
ten to twelve minutes to one pound, 
or until cooked, basting frequently 
with water and melted butter. 

Variation. — Add to every cup of 
water used in basting the juice of one 
lemon and one teaspoonful of onion 
juice. 

To broil Fish 

Wipe fish dry, and brush lightly with 
oil or melted butter. Place in double 
wire broiler, and broil over a clear 
fire, turning every other minute until 
both sides are a light, even brown. 
Remove carefully from broiler, sep- 
arating, if necessary, with a sharp knife. 

Variation. — Add to oil or butter with 
which fish is greased a little lemon 
juice, vinegar, or onion* juice. 

To fry Fish 

Wipe fish dry. Season with salt and 
pepper. Roll in fine crumbs, then

dip in a mixture of beaten egg and 
water, two tablespoonfuls of water to 
one egg, crumb again, and fry three 
to six minutes in deep fat, heated so 
as to smoke lightly at sides of kettle. 

Variation. — Place fish for half an 
hour or more before frying in a mari- 
nade made of three parts of vinegar 
to one of oil. 

Notes 

Only small fish, or larger when cut 
into fillets, cutlets, or steaks, are suit- 
able for frying. 

When fish are to be cooked whole, 
the head and tail are usually left on, 
but the fins should be removed. 

Scales can be scraped off by holding 
knife with blade nearly perpendicular 
to skin of fish, but slanting slightly 
outward, and scraping from tail to 
head. 

Fresh water fish are often improved 
by soaking in salted water for thirty 
minutes before cooking. 

When fish are cooked a sufficient 
length of time, the flesh separates read- 
ily from the bone. This test is inva- 
riably correct, and is more reliable 
than any time test. 

A fish platter can be handsomely 
garnished with cress, parsley, olives, 
radishes, slices of lemon, or slices of 
cucumber. 

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE 

Ingredients and Proportions. — Equal 
parts of unbeaten egg, butter, and 
boiling water. One-eighth as much 
vinegar or lemon juice as butter. Salt 
and cayenne or paprika. 

Method. — Cream butter. Add egg. 
Add other ingredients, and cook oyer 
hot water, beating constantly with 
Dover beater until thick. 

Drawn Butter Sauce 

Season a cupful of thin cream with 

salt and pepper, add one tablespoonful 

of butter and one-half a tablespoonful 

of flour rubbed together, and cook to- 



gether until the mixture comes to a 
boil. 

A white sauce, made of flour, butter, 
and water or milk, is sometimes sub- 
stituted for above.

THE SIMPLE LIFE 

EVERYBODY is reading Charles 
Wagner's "The Simple Life." We 
have not neglected this privi- 
lege. The book is not for the hasty, 
superficial reader: its contents are to 
be weighed and considered. The writer 
is a profound student and observer of 
life. He has had wide experience, 
pondered deeply on the mysteries of 
life, and arrived at conclusions. He is 
a preacher, but his message, free from 
creed and dogma, appeals to every 
man and woman. To the question, 
Is life worth living? he answers, Yes, — 
that is, the simple life. 
But what is meant by the simple 



life ? Of what does it consist ? And his 
answer, though plain, is not so succinct. 
The simple life does not imply, at all, 
a return to the good old times of our 
ancestors, simple though these were. 
It does not depend on " material good 
in all its luxurious development"; but, 
as he declares, it depends upon the 
soul and spirit. 

1 ' Instead of looking toward the ideal 
of simplicity in life with impotent re- 
gret, he asserts that we can make it 
the object of our resolution, the aim 
of our practical energy." Simplicity 
and lowly station, plain dress, a modest 
dwelling, slender means, poverty, do 
not necessarily go together. "Sim- 
plicity is a state of mind. It dwells 
in the main intention of our lives. A 
man is simple when his chief care is 
the wish to be what he ought to be, — 
that is, honestly and naturally human. 
The simple life consists in putting our 
acts and aspirations in accordance 
with the law of our being, and conse- 
quently with the Eternal Intention 
which willed that we should be at all. 
Let a flower be a flower, a rock a rock, 
and let a man be a man. This is the 
sum of the whole matter." 

Such, then, is the meaning of the 
simple life. It means living in harmony 
with the law of our being. It is nat- 
ural rather than artificial life. Mate- 
rial good, station, honor, power, how- 
ever desirable and helpful these may 
be, are not the things of chief concern. 
These should be made subordinate, 
instrumental in the process of simpli- 
fying life. And yet quite to the con- 
trary, it would seem, life is becoming 
more and more artificial and unnatural. 
Competition is daily more and more 
strenuous. As it is put in the iron 
region, people are so busy in making 
everlasting pig iron they cannot stop 
long enough to attend to their higher 
welfare. The more one has, the more 
one wants; and "the reign of wants is 
by no means the reign of brotherhood. 



Editorials 



305 



The more things a man desires for him- 
self, the less he can do for his neighbor." 

Among the best chapters of this 
timely volume are those on The Life 
of the Home, Simple Beauty, Pride 
and Simplicity, and Education for Sim- 
plicity. The chief merit of the book 
lies in the point of view, the high van- 
tage-ground from which the discussion 
proceeds, and in the almost unprece- 
dented manner in which it deals with 
the engrossing questions of the day. 

Hitherto we have read much of sim- 
plicity; but here the practical living of 
the simple life is made an ideal, pointing 
the way to nobler and more satisfac- 
tory conducts of life. "The law of 
education for simplicity," the author 
asserts, "may be summed up in these 
words: to make free and reverential 
men, who shall be individual and fra- 
ternal." 



INTEREST AND SUCCESS 

INTEREST is essential to all suc- 
cessful attainment. Satisfaction 
in work well done produces con- 
tentment. Too many women, we fear, 
are apt to regard housekeeping as a 
monotonous grind to be endured, rather 
than a calling to honor and adorn. 
And yet, in comparison with other 
occupations in which women now 
engage, that of the housekeeper does 
not suffer either in amount of time 
spent or energy expended. To cite 
cases is needless. The point of differ- 
ence is marked by the spirit in which 
the work is undertaken. 

The conduct of a modern home calls 
for exercise of no mean ability, no 
mediocre display of activity. For, 
as it is now said, a knowledge of the 
laws of health, an understanding of 
the sanitary requirements of the house, 
the study of values, both absolute and 
relative, of the various articles used in 
the home, including food, the wise 
expenditure of money, time, and en- 



ergy, the scientific principles under- 
lying the selection and preparation of 
food, the right care of children, — both 
physical and mental, — the ability to 
secure efficient service from others, 
and practice in the different household 
.arts, — all are required before the house- 
wife can be considered mistress of her 
home. 

It does not follow from all this that 
woman's activities should be confined 
to the duties of home. Often the 
man of business has many and varied 
interests outside his own office. Why 
may not the home-maker enlarge her 
outlook and extend her influence? 
But, as long as we hold to the good 
old maxim, " Whatsoever thy hand 
findeth to do, do it with thy might," 
reason is for entering upon our daily 
household tasks with earnest, zealous 
spirit. 

The time has "arrived" when ig- 
norance should be separated from 
household affairs. The skilful hand 
and the intelligent, trained workman 
are everywhere in demand. Intelli- 
gence must reign in the home. The 
calling of the housekeeper will not be 
wanting in capable, efficient employees, 
when it is made to be the most respect- 
able of all occupations for women. 

DRUDGERY 

AFTER all, regular routine of 
living is what we like. It is the 
unexpected occurrence that up- 
sets us and taxes most our nerves and 
strength. Else why do we want our 
meals regularly and at the moment of 
appointed time? Why does she, who 
is accustomed to an afternoon nap, 
suffer from an occasional loss of the 
same, and appear at disadvantage for 
the rest* of the day? Why does a 
man chafe and fret over the accidental 
deprivation of his after-dinner cigar? 
We are creatures of habit and custom, 
and are fond of routine. We like to 



306

revisit familiar places, and meet again 
old friends. Our own books and im- 
plements suit us best. We feel most 
comfortable and at home in our own 
dens. No other chair, even, seems quite 
as satisfactory as that in which we are 
wont to sit. Socrates was accused of 
introducing the worship of new and 
strange deities ; and to these the people 
did not readily take. 

This trait by no means excludes 
the love of variety in life nor the de- 
sire for new acquisition and growth 
in knowledge. In time, however, these, 
too, are made to constitute only an- 
other part of the general routine of 
which the average life is so largely 
made up. People everywhere speedily 
adapt themselves to their environ- 
ments, and become strongly attached 
to their customary ways of living. 



TO OUR READERS 

WITH no desire to boast or 
claim, we may verily say 
the Cooking-School Maga- 
zine, with rare exception, is the only 
distinctive and reliable culinary publi- 
cation in America. As a periodical, 
it was the pioneer in presenting half- 
tone illustrations of prepared dishes, 
culinary processes and appliances; and 
its work in this line has never been 
equalled. 

From cover to cover, the magazine 
is designed for the intelligent house- 
keeper, not merely to amuse and en- 
tertain for an idle hour, but to be use- 
ful, every day of the current month, 
in the details of housekeeping, and 
then to be filed away as a book of 
frequent reference. As an authority 
in household affairs it has no superior. 
Its reliability has been tested far 
and near, at home and abroad, and 
has not been found wanting. 

We think the magazine has been im- 
proved steadily, from month to month, 
♦he past. In the next year we wish 



marked progress to appear in the gen- 
eral excellence of its contents, and, 
consequently, in its usefulness. As an 
aid to this end, how many of our ap- 
preciative readers will avail them- 
selves of the opportunity, given else- 
where in this number, to mail us the 
names of friends or neighbors who 
may be pleased to examine a specimen 
copy of the magazine? Or are we, 
in asking this favor, presuming too 
much upon the good will of our patrons? 



FOOD BEFORE LESSONS 

At a conference on education, Sir 
J. Crichton Browne, the well-known 
physician, reminded the scholastic sa- 
vans present that in the evolution of 
man feeding came before education. 

He begged his audience to bear in 
mind that the inherited skill of the 
race depended upon their physical 
health and good feeding. 



In the cold months it is well to re- 
member, when arranging dietaries, and 
more especially for the poorer classes, 
that certain classes of hydrocarbons 
are absolutely needful in order to keep 
up the necessary energy and bodily 
heat. Fat is too often reduced below 
the advisable limit; but most fats are 
not very easy to digest, more especially 
so with the weak, and then sugar will 
most readily supply the requisite heat 
and energy. Cheap sugar is a great 
boon to the masses, whether it is in- 
dulged in as sweet jam, in puddings, 
as chocolate, or (for children) in the 
form of pure sugar sweeties. Sugar 
is quickly absorbed, and is at once con- 
verted into heat; and so, while not 
quite so lasting in its effects, it has cer- 
tain advantages over the commoner 
fats. But the important thing is to 
realize that for the poor, and particu- 
larly for children, sugar is not merely 
* luxury, but an important item in 
the food ration. — Food and Cookery.

Parker House Rolls for Breakfast 
About one o'clock stir one cake of 
compressed yeast into one-fourth a cup 
of scalded-and-cooled milk, then add 
to a cup of milk, scalded and cooled 
to a lukewarm temperature. Add also 
a tablespoonful of sugar and half a 
teaspoonful of salt, then stir in about 
one cup and a half of flour or enough 
to make a batter. Beat thoroughly, 
then cover, and set aside to become 
light. When the batter is well puffed 
up, stir in one-third a cup of melted 
butter and Hour to make a dough that 
may be kneaded. About two cups will 
be required. Knead the dough until 
it is elastic, then cover, and set aside to 
become very light. Roll into a sheet 
half an inch thick. Cut into rounds, 
brush half the surface of each round 
with melted butter, and fold the un- 
buttered half over the buttered sur- 
face. Set these a little distance apart 
in a baking-pan, and, when nearly light 



enough to bake, set into the refriger- 
ator on the cake of ice. In the morn- 
ing bake about twenty- five minutes. 
When nearly baked, brush over the 
tops with thin starch, made by boil- 
ing a teaspoonful of cornstarch, diluted 
with a little cold water, in a cup of 
boiling water, and return to the oven, 
to finish cooking. A dish of hot water 
set into the oven during the cooking 
will insure a tender crust. 

Formula for Three Pints of 
Standard Broth 

(Beef, Veal, Lamb, Chicken, or Game) 
Select four pounds of meat that is 
fresher than that for roasting. Let 
bone form about one-fourth the weight. 
Saw the bone, and cut the meat in 
small pieces. If a rather dark-looking 
stock be desired, brown a part of the 
meat in a frying-pan by cooking it very 
slowly in marrow or fat taken from

When the meat is sufficiently browned, 
add it to the soup kettle. Rinse out 
the frying-pan with some of the liquid 
from the soup kettle, to melt from it 
all the browned juices that are to color 
the soup. Heat the ingredients to the 
boiling-point, then let simmer con-

Saratoga Potatoes and Bernhardt 
Potatoes 

(Serve with Steak or Chops) 

Select long potatoes, nearly uniform 

in size throughout, and pare thin. For 



the simplest is a "potato curler," cost- 
ing twenty-five cents. Use this as 
directed on the circular accompanying 
it. Let the prepared pota- 
toes stand, covered with ice 
water, two hours or longer, 
changing the water once, at 
least. When ready to fry, 
drain the potatoes and dry 
them on a cloth, taking care 
that each shoe be perfectly 
dried. Then plunge a curl 
or about a dozen slices into 
the hot fat. Separate the 
slices with a skimmer, and 
let cook to a golden-yellow 
color throughout. Then re- 
move to soft paper on a dish, 
dredge lightly with salt, and 
let stand at the mouth of the oven 
until ready to serve. If the fat be 
heated so that smoke is visible, you 
may know that it is too hot. Es- 
pecially will this be the case, if the fat 
be lard or olive oil. With cottolene 
or beef suet a slight vapor, rather than 
smoke, is occasionally seen when the 
kettle of fat has reached the right tem- 
perature for deep frying. The proper 
temperature is about 325 Fahr.

move the papers, and decorate with 
half a cup of double cream, sweet- 
ened, flavored with vanilla, and 
beaten firm. 

Cranberry Sauce 
Heat one pint of sugar and one pint 
of water to the boiling-point. Add one 
quart of cranberries, cover the sauce- 
pan, and let stand on the back of the 
range five minutes. Then move to 
the front of the range, and let cook five 
minutes after boiling begins. Set the 
sauce aside, covered, in the saucepan 
until cold. 



constantly, until it becomes a clear 
brown liquid (caramel). Add at once 
half a cup of boiling water, and stir 
until the caramel is dissolved. Then 
add one-fourth a cup of sugar, and set 
the saucepan into a dish of hot water. 
Beat the yolks of two eggs. Add one- 
fourth a cup of sugar and one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of salt, and beat again. 
Then cook the egg mixture in the hot 
sugar mixture until the whole thickens 
slightly. Let this chill, set in ice and 
water. Have ready a cup of double 
cream and a cup of cream or milk, 
taken from the top of a quart jar of 
milk, beaten solid to the bottom of the 
bowl. When the first mixture is 
chilled, beat the cream into it by de- 
grees until half of it is added, then 
cut and fold in the rest. Turn the 
mixture into a brick mould, quart size, 
lined with waxed paper. Cover the 
top with paper, press the cover down 
over the paper, and let the mould 
stand about two hours, packed in equal

measures of crushed ice and rock salt. 
When unmoulded, sprinkle with sliced 
almonds (blanched), browned in the 
oven, and two or three tablespoonfuls of 
crushed caramel. Surround with mush- 
room meringues. (See frontispiece.) 

. Crushed Caramel 
Stir and cook the sugar over a hot 
fire till it becomes a brown liquid, not 
too dark in color, and turn at once 
on to an oiled plate. When cold, pound 
in a mortar to a smooth powder, and 
store in a cup, covered. Crush again 
before using. This is particularly good 
to sprinkle over chocolate, vanilla, or 
caramel ice-cream in bricks or in in- 
dividual portions. It is also received 
with favor when sprinkled upon 
whipped cream served on a cup of 
cocoa. One-fourth a cup of sugar will 
make enough caramel to use for this 
purpose several times. 



Have ready hard wood boards an inch 
thick, and of suitable length for the 
oven. Cover these with strips of paper, 
and tack at each end, to hold the paper 
in place. Upon this with pastry bag 
and plain tube shape mushroom stems 
and caps. Sift cocoa or powdered 
cinnamon over the caps, and set to 
bake in a moderate oven. Do not 
let the mixture color for at least half 
an hour. 

Nut Cake with Chocolate Frosting 
Beat half a cup of butter to a cream. 
Gradually beat in one cup and a half 
of sugar, then, alternately, three - 
fourths a cup of milk and two cups of 
flour, sifted with two level teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder. Add one cup of 
nut meats, chopped fine, and the whites 
of four eggs, beaten dry. Beat vigor- 
ously. Bake in a sheet in a shallow 
pan between thirty and forty min- 



Nut Cake with Chocolate Frosting 



Mushroom Meringues 
Beat the whites of three large fresh 
eggs until dry. Then gradually beat 
into them half a cup of sugar and a 
teaspoonful of vanilla extract, beating 
at the last, until the mixture is very 
glossy. Then cut and fold into the 
mixture a scant half a cup of sugar. 



utes. When cold, cover the inverted 
cake with chocolate frosting, and finish 
with halves of nut meats. 

Chocolate Frosting 
Put one cup of sugar, half an ounce 
chocolate, and one- fourth a cup of 
water over the fire. Stir until the

chocolate is dissolved, without letting 
the syrup boil. Then cover, let boil 
two or three minutes, then remove the 
cover, and let cook until the mixture, 
tested in cold water, forms a soft ball. 
Then pour in a fine stream onto the 
beaten white of one egg, beaten until 
nearly dry. Flavor with vanilla. Beat 
until cold, then use as directed. 

Cream Cheese with Bar-le-Duc 
Currants, Flower Fashion 

To serve Eight 

(Serve with Crackers or Cassava Bread as a Last 
Course at Luncheon) 

Dispose heart leaves of lettuce, care- 
fully cleansed and dried, in a circle 
on a serving-dish to simulate the calyx 
of a flower. Press one or two cream 
cheese through a ricer onto the inner 
and stem ends of the lettuce, forming 
a wreath of the cheese, and fill the cen- 
tre with red Bar-le-Duc currants. If 
desired, half a cup of cream, beaten 
solid with one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt, may be mixed with the cheese 
before it is pressed through the ricer. 
Add the cheese gradually to the cream. 

Chocolate Custard with Whipped 

Cream 

To serve Three 
(Sweet for Luncheon or Dinner) 

Melt half an ounce of chocolate over 
hot water. Add two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar and two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of cold water, and cook until 
smooth. Then add one cup of milk. 
Beat two eggs. Add one-fourth a 
cup of sugar, less that used with the 
chocolate, one-fourth a teaspoonful, 
each, of cinnamon and salt, and beat 
again. Then add the milk and choc- 
olate, and turn into charlotte russe 
moulds, thoroughly buttered and 
dredged with sugar. Bake, set on 
several folds of paper in a dish con- 
taining boiling water, until the centres 
are firm. When cold, turn from the 
moulds, and fill the open centres with 



half a cup of cream, two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, and a few drops of va- 
nilla, beaten solid. 

Prune Whip 

To serve Three 
(Sweet Dish for Luncheon or Dinner) 

Wash ten prunes, and let them lie 
over night in cold water. Cook until 
tender, then press through a sieve. 
Add a scant fourth a cup of sugar, 
and let cook until thick. Have ready 
the whites of two fresh eggs, beaten 
dry. Cut and fold these into the hot 
prime mixture. When the egg is set, re- 
move from the fire, and set aside to be- 
come cold. Serve with boiled custard. 

Boiled Custard 

Scald one cup and a half of milk 
over hot water. Beat the yolks of 
two eggs, then beat again with one- 
fourth a cup of sugar and a few grains 
of salt. Gradually add a little of the 
hot milk, mix thoroughly, and turn 
into the rest of the milk. Cook and 
stir until thickened slightly. 

Veal and Oyster Pie 

To serve Four 

Have a pound of veal cutlet cut in 
small pieces. Roll these in flour, and 
brown them in a little hot bacon fat. 
Then cover with boiling water, or 
preferably with stock, made from trim- 
mings of meat and flavored with sweet 
herbs, carrot, and onion, and simmer 
about two hours. Put the pieces of 
veal in a baking-dish. Have ready 
half a cup of cooked ham, chopped 
fine. Add to it a little of the hot liquid, 
and pound smooth in a mortar. Then 
press through a pur6e sieve, and add 
to the rest of the liquid with such sea- 
soning as is needed. Pour this over 
the meat in the dish, adding here and 
there half a pint of oysters and a few 
bits of butter. Cover with a pastry 
or biscuit crust, and bake about twenty- 
five minutes.

After Breakfast Chat

In Reference to Menus and Recipes 

The ambitious will trust to her kitchen to win her reputation. — The Feasts of Aulolycus 



Cake-making 

THE principles involved in the 
mixing of cake are easily 
learned. The baking requires 
experience, and an oven which responds 
quickly to variations in dampers and 
drafts, and can be regulated to a nicety. 
One should never try a new cake on 
an occasion when a first success needs 
be assured; for, in cakes of delicate 
texture, the lack of one or two table- 
spoonfuls of flour will make all the dif- 
ference between a glowing success and 
a dismal failure. Where so much de- 
pends upon accuracy in proportions, 
weight, not measure, should determine 
tie quantities to be used. We have 
repeatedly seen a class of pupils make 
cake by the same recipe, and each 
claim to have followed it accurately. 
The results would vary from a dense, 
stodgy cake, peaked and cracked in 
the middle, to a cake with crisp, but- 
tery edges, and centre inclined to fall. 
Cake-making demands exact pro- 
portions, and at present there is a lack 
of uniformity in measurements by 
scale and cup. In following a cake re- 
cipe, the old adage, "A pint's a pound the 
world around," cannot be interpreted 
too literally. In practice it takes a 
quart of unsifted flour to weigh a 
pound. By experiment it may be 
found that a cup of flour, measured 
after sifting once, and filled with a 



spoon, is quite another thing from a 
cup of flour, measured after sifting 
once, and filled by dipping the cup into 
the flour. Also the different brands 
of flour vary in their thickening prop- 
erties. We are most desirous that our 
readers have success with the cake re- 
cipes that we publish. We would sug- 
gest, as a rather firm cake is not un- 
edible, that, in trying a new recipe one 
tablespooirful of sifted flour, measured 
level, be added to each cup indicated 
in the recipe, to cover possible varia- 
tions in the thickening quality of the 
various brands of flour. After this 
test the additional spoonful may be 
added at discretion. Hereafter in cake 
recipes, whenever practicable, the 
weight of sugar, flour, and butter used 
will be given, as well as the measure 
by cup. In all recipes where yeast is 
not called for, pastry flour is used. A 
proper measuring cup holds half a 
pint of liquid and half a pound of but- 
ter, closely packed. Two cups and a 
half of flour, the cup filled with flour 
sifted once, and by means of a spoon, 
is needed, to secure half a pound in 
weight. 

Food attracts First through the 
Eye 

The looks of a dish goes a long way 
toward making it desirable. In a pub- 
lic dining-room we see a dish, prepared

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



for some one else, that pleasantly at- 
tracts the eye, and we fain would try 
it, though it be an article for which we 
do not ordinarily ask. In our every- 
day cooking we do not make effort 
enough in this line. We do not wish 
to be misunderstood on this point. 
We are not referring particularly to 
dishes of fanciful shape or those made 
fine with elaborate garnishes. The 
sight of some simple dish, perfectly 
cooked, as a dish of mashed potato, 
beaten to a snowy foam and with every 
indication of being hot and nicely 
seasoned, or, even a dish of plain 
boiled potatoes, flaky and mealy in 
appearance, will cause the digestive 
juices to flow and a desire to eat. 

A baked custard is by no means a 
new or an elaborate dish; yet how few 
bake and unmould one so carefully 
that its regular external appearance, 
or its delicacy of texture, when it is 
cut into, would cause a pronounced 
desire to taste it! We are not — unless 
we are cooking for the public, which 
is merciless in its demands — careful 
enough in small details, which mean 
perfection. Often this lack in a fin- 
ished dish comes from inexperience 
rather than from carelessness. In all 
dishes in which the proteid principle 
predominates, cooking below the boil- 
ing-point of water will secure delicacy 
of texture. 

Unmoulding Timbales, Custards, 

etc. 

The appearance of many dishes de- 
pends entirely upon their removal from 
a mould in perfect shape. To secure 
this, moulds for timbales (except egg) 
should have a small round of paper 
set in place on the bottom before but- 
tering them. Moulds for custards and 
some baked puddings should be 
dredged with sugar after buttering 
them. When the cooking is done, 
timbales and similar hot mixtures need 
stand an instant, to contract a little. 



Then with pointed knife separate the 
edge of the mixture from the mould, 
and gently turn around with top 
tipped toward one, to see that the cooked 
timbale has separated from the mould 
at every point. When this is seen, 
turn the timbale onto the dish, if it is 
to be surrounded with sauce, or onto 
a soft cloth, to take up any liquid that 
may have formed around it. Then 
move to the serving-dish with a spat- 
ula or broad knife. Moulds of char- 
lotte russe, parfait, or ice, are un- 
moulded with ease, if the moulds have 
been first lined with paper. Moulds 
with double covers are preferable for 
all ices, and with these a hard wood 
block of size to slip loosely into the 
mould is of great assistance in press- 
ing the ice from the mould to the plate.

About Truffles 

By Mrs. E. M. Lucas 



THEjRE is, perhaps, no edible 
delicacy so little known to 
people generally as the truffle. 
Housewives, of course, know they 
come in tins or bottles, and that, oc- 
casionally, they are to be had fresh 
from the provisioner; but knowledge 
ends there. 

A dish prepared with truffles is one 
of the triumphs of culinary art. The 
perfume of truffles, newly exhumed, is 
suggestive of violets with an admixture 
of musk, a sweet woodsy smell, and 
all together the finest, rarest scent, 
that rather excites than satisfies the 
olfactory sense. Who would suspect, 
from its plain, hard exterior, what -a 
rare delicacy was to be its perfume and 
flavor? 

The truffle is jet black, with wart- 
like excrescences covering its surface. 
Inside it is purplish-black or tinged 
with pink marbled with light veins. 

It is by no means a modern acquisi- 
tion. At splendid banquets in ancient 
Rome, where they served such tidbits 
as tongues of singing-birds, and the 
pikce de resistance was the entire bulk 
of a boar stuffed with thrushes, we read 
that truffles were used in profusion, 
Poets sang its praises, and the learned 
among the ancients disputed, as learned 
men even to this day are doing, its 
characteristics. 

Theophrastus declared it was a sub- 
terranean plant. Pliny called it an 
"excrescence of the earth." Modern 
naturalists have agreed to disagree in 
regard to its antecedents. While some 
claim it has the botanical and chemical 
properties of the mushroom, others 
maintain that truffles area contradic- 
tion and a mystery. 

It seems as if Dame Nature regards 
it as a precious thing, not to be offered 



to the profane eye; for she keeps it 
carefully in the ground, and no ex- 
terior evidence indicates its home. It 
is a curious thing, — a vegetable growth 
without doubt, yet it has neither leaves, 
roots, nor stem that mortal eye can see. 

Another curious thing is that not yet 
has any one succeeded in propagating 
truffles. They disdain culture. Their 
cultivation on a regular system — as 
mushrooms — has been often tried in 
France and this country, but it has 
proved a flat failure. 

Expectation was entertained that a 
supply of truffles might be obtained by 
planting fragments of the mature fun- 
gus in wooded localities, but the most 
careful attention to their cultivation 
ended in disappointment. They be- 
long to the woods by inheritance, not 
by the aid of man, and their wild habits 
must be consulted. 

Lately, however, science has come to 
the aid of man in propagating truffles 
by artificial means. 

It has been discovered that the 
spawn of the truffle can be developed 
by inoculating potatoes or carrots with 
them. Experiments are being tried 
here and in France. A thin piece of 
the fungus is introduced into each 
potato, and the latter is put in a moist 
dark place. Within a few weeks ap- 
pear threads of spawn. This is care- 
fully gathered and sown in bottles con- 
taining a mixture of starch and glu- 
cose. The bottles are then sealed and 
subjected to some process known only 
to the experimentalist, who naturally 
guards his secret until success may 
have crowned his efforts. At any rate, 
the bottle gardens thrive and develop 
spawn, and, when the process has gone 
far enough, the artificial spawn is sown 
near oak-trees. Sufficient time has not

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



elapsed to ascertain results, but hopes 
are entertained for success. 

Though several countries pride them- 
selves on their truffle beds, to France 
belongs the palm of producing the finest 
specimens. There they say, " Where 
the vine thrives, there thrives the 
truffle"; but trees, especially oaks, 
must thrive there also, and the soil 
must abound in lime, chalk, or flint. 
All these conditions obtain in California 
also, and recently an attempt has been 
made to put up the native product in 
cans for the market. 

In Prance many truffle-growers make 
periodical sowings of acorns, and truf- 
fles come with the oaks, and this with- 
out sowing any morsel of truffle; that 
is, they spring from the soil spontane- 
ously, probably from spores lying dor- 
mant in the ground. Such plantations 
must be ten or twelve years old before 
the truffles appear, but they are ob- 
tained from such planted grounds for 
thirty years, when the soil ceases to 
be productive. 

Many a time some poor peasant, 
noting his pigs rooting up the precious 
delicacy (for they grow under ground), 
has discovered a truffle bed on his bar- 
ren ground; and thus his Aladdin's 
lamp is found, for the truffles command 
two dollars a pound in the market, and 



the demand always exceeds the supply. 
In the market of Apt alone thirty-five 
to forty hundred pounds are handled 
each week during the harvest, if such 
it can be called. 

Four species of truffles are found ex- 
clusively in France, and in Italy there 
is a very large-sized one that commands 
a higher price than others. 

Truffles are gathered at two periods 
of the year. In May only a white 
species is to be found, which never 
blackens and has no fragrance. They 
are dried, and used for seasoning. 

Black truffles commence forming in 
June, enlarging and rising nearer and 
nearer to the surface of the soil which 
covers them, as the ripening process 
goes on. They are found at a depth of 
from two to eight inches, and vary in 
size from a robin's egg to five or six 
inches in diameter; but the flavor is in 
no way controlled by the size. 

The season for digging truffles is 
from November to January, when they 
are firm and full of fragrance. 

Trained pigs are employed to search 
for them. At a distance of ten feet 
they scent them, and run to the spot, 
digging into the earth with the nose. 
The pigs would soon root up and eat 
the treasure, were it not for the arti- 
ficial snouts they wear. 



With Corn and Popper 

By Mary Taylor-Ross 



IN every home a corn-popper and 
a supply of popcorn should be 
kept where it can be conveniently 
brought forth on any evening through- 
out the winter, when the children and 
even those of a larger growth will 
enjoy gathering around the fire and 



watching the little grains of corn as 
they are metamorphosed into white 
puff-balls that are so delicious when 
treated generously with good dairy 
butter. 

Popcorn is an inexpensive confection,

tritious and beneficial. Children, how- 
ever, should be encouraged to take 
some form of liquid with it, since it is 
dry, and apt to swell in the stomach 
and cause distress, if a large quantity 
be eaten. 

Milk is best to serve with popcorn; 
and, indeed, in many nurseries a sup- 
per of popcorn and milk is hailed with 
delight as a welcome change from the 
ordinary bread and milk. 

An almost unlimited variety of sweets 
may be made of popcorn. Below are 
given a few of these, as well as some 
desserts which will offer something out 
of the ordinary. 

First of all, the corn must be prop- 
erly popped, and there is much in the 
way this is done. The more slowly 
corn is popped, the better it is; and, 
therefore, after the kernels are placed 
in the popper, pour cold water over 
them. Then, if the fire is very hot, 
shake the popper for a time outside 
the lid, or hold it quite a distance from 
the fire. Then gradually draw the 
popper where the fire is hotter, and 
watch the clock. If a kernel pops 
under four minutes after the corn has 
been placed over the fire, draw the 
popper away from the heat; but, if it 
has been over the fire fully four min- 
utes, and does not pop, then hold it 
down close, to get the strongest heat 
possible, shaking it all the time to 
keep the corn from burning, and about 
every kernel will pop at once. When 
there is a long time from the popping 
of the first kernel until all are popped, 
the first will have become tough from 
the heat. Wetting the corn creates a 
steam when the popper is put over the 
fire. This softens the shell of the ker- 
nel, and gives it time to become thor- 
oughly heated, and, when it does pop, 
each kernel bursts open from the very 
centre, leaving no hard centres, as is 
so often the case when corn is heated 
too quickly. 

Red ears are always best, being 



sweetest and tenderest. Save the 
hands by removing the kernels with a 
strong iron spoon or a dull knife. 
Put enough corn in the popper just 
not to cover the bottom, and then 
thoroughly saturate with cold water, 
and proceed as above. 

Such popcorn is as light as a feather 
and white as snow. 

Buttered Popcorn 

Put four quarts of fresh popped 
corn into a large bowl. Melt two 
tablespoonfuls of good butter that is 
well salted, and pour over the corn in 
a thin stream, stirring the corn so as 
to butter it evenly. Do not be dis- 
couraged if it is not evenly buttered 
at first trial. Repeated efforts will 
make one expert, so that each kernel 
will be evenly buttered. Immediately 
after pouring on the butter shake salt 
evenly over all while stirring the corn. 
The salt will cling to the butter instead 
of falling to the bottom of the dish as 
it does when sprinkled on before the 
butter. 

Sugared Popcorn 

Place over the fire a cup of sugar 
and half a cup of water, with a piece 
of butter the size of an egg, and just 
a dash of vinegar. Cook these together 
until they form a syrup, and pour this 
over the corn tirhile stirring, exactly as 
the butter was poured. Sometimes the 
syrup may be colored a little with red 
or pink fruit coloring liquid, and then 
one can easily see if it is being evenly 
spread over all the corn. 

Candied Popcorn 

Into an agate kettle put one table- 
spoonful of butter, three tablespoon- 
fuls of water, and one cup of powdered 
sugar. Boil till just ready to candy, 
then turn into the kettle two quarts of 
fresh popped corn. Stir briskly with 
a wire spoon, using care not to crush 
the corn, until the syrup is evenly 



3*4 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



distributed. Then remove the kettle 
from the fire, and stir till the corn is 
cooled a little, and each separate grain 
is crystallized with the syrup. Take 
care not to burn the corn while it is 
over the fire in the syrup. While stir- 
ring it about after it is removed from 
the fire, red sugar may be sprinkled 
over it. This will fasten to the corn 
with the syrup. 

Popcorn Cakes 

These may be made without either 
mould or grinder. As fast as each pop- 
per of corn is popped, turn onto the 
moulding-board a little at a time, and 
roll with the rolling-pin. Have the 
molasses boiled as for candy, before 
popping the corn, and, when the corn 
is all popped, pour the hot molasses 
candy over the crushed corn, stir- 
ring thoroughly. Turn into a large 
baking-pan of the sort called "dripping- 
pan," and press down firm, patting it 
solid with a potato masher. Mark into 
squares with a sharp knife, and, when 
cold, break apart. 

Candied corn-cakes are made by pre- 
paring a quantity of syrup, of the kind 
mentioned above for candied popcorn, 
and letting it boil till it candies when 
put into cold water. This may be left 
white or colored pink or green, and, 
when the corn is crushed, use it exactly 
like the molasses syrup in the foregoing 
recipe. Chocolate corn-cakes are made 
in just the same fashion, making the 
same syrup, and putting chocolate into 
it. Use powdered cocoa, putting in 
enough to turn the syrup quite dark. 
The colored cakes are very pretty, and 
it is a simple matter to make three 
kinds, dividing the syrup, leaving one 
part white, and making the other two 
pink and green with fruit-coloring 
matter. One may use one's own canned 
fruit juices, a little grape juice mak- 
ing a pretty lavender, red currant juice 
producing pink, and a little spinach 
juice green. 



A unique and delicious dainty to 
serve to one's guests is popcorn with 
ice-cream. The corn is neither but- 
tered nor salted. The plain, snowy 
corn is heaped around the mound of 
ice-cream in a little circle. Many who 
consider popcorn rather flat enjoy it 
in this way. 

Cracker Jack 

Melt two cups of granulated sugar 
in a saucepan, stirring all the time, to 
keep it from scorching. When the 
sugar is all melted, and has become a 
dark-looking syrup, add to it a gener- 
ous tablespoonful of molasses and a 
piece of butter the size of an egg. 
Have ready some popped corn, and, 
after placing it in a wide, shallow pan, 
pour the mixture over it, evenly dis- 
tributing it so that every bit of the 
popcorn is covered. Set away to 
harden, and then strike the bottom of 
the pan vigorously with a knife handle, 
and the cracker jack will break up into 
irregular pieces. 

After popping a quantity of corn, 
place it in a pan, and set in the oven 
about ten minutes, and it will make 
the corn crisp and tender, improving 
the flavor. Especially should this be 
done, whenever the corn is to be eaten 
without making it into a confection. 

Popcorn Wafers 

This is something a little out of the 
ordinary, and very simple to prepare. 
Make some boiled frosting according to 
the recipe for boiled sugar frosting 
for cake, then stir into it some tender 
popcorn that has been properly popped 
and buttered and salted. Pour this 
onto thin wafers, either sweet wafers, 
like champagne wafers, or onto ordinary 
sal tines, or "biscuits," as the English 
call them. Have the frosting about an 
inch thick, and put the wafers into a 
quick oven, to brown slightly over the 
top. Serve, when cold, with ice-cream 
or with a lemon water ice.

Popcorn Pudding 

Use three pints of rich milk, three 
heaping pints of popped corn, three eggs, 
one-half a cup of sugar, three level tea- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch or six of flour, 
one-half a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
little flavoring, using a teaspoonful of 
vanilla or the juice and grated rind of a

and serve with sweet cream. 



Food and Health 

By Mrs. H. M. Plunkett 



DR. LOUIS L. SEAMAN, of 
New York, who was surgeon- 
major to the voluntary army 
in the Spanish War, went to the Far 
Bast to study the hospitals of Japan, 
having been led to believe that they 
were thoroughly up-to-date, incorpo- 
rating into their practice all the les- 
sons derived from sore experience. 

His investigations have proved highly 
valuable and interesting, the most im- 
portant point being the way in which 
the Japanese place their medical em- 
phasis, not on repairing wounds, — 
though these heal with a surprising 
rapidity, — but on preventive measures 
to keep their army from becoming dis- 
abled by disease; and the steps they 
have taken to keep their men well 
have resulted in such a fortification 
of their systems that recovery from 
wounds is not only wonderfully rapid, 
but free from complications with other 
diseases. Here is what a Japanese 
general said to Dr. Seaman: "Russia 
may be able to place 2,000,000 men in 
the field. We can furnish 500,000. 
You know in every war four men die 
of disease for every one who falls from 
bullets. That will be the position of 
Russia in this war. We propose to 



eliminate disease as a factor. Every 
man who dies in our army must fall 
on the field of battle. In this way we 
shall neutralize the superiority of Rus- 
sian numbers, and stand on a compara- 
tively equal footing." 

To make this statement good, Dr. 
vSeaman says the* Japanese medical 
officer is everywhere. Recognizing the 
fact that the health of a man's body 
depends mainly on the food and drink 
that is put into it, the medical officer 
is with the first scouts on any proposed 
route, and with microscope and chem- 
icals he tests and labels every well, so 
that the soldiers shall drink no con- 
taminated water. If contagious dis- 
ease is found, the locality is quaran- 
tined and notices posted, so that it 
shall be avoided; but, above all, the 
closest attention is given to foodstuffs. 
Those on the route are examined, and, 
if found tainted, are condemned. And, 
if the water needs boiling, notices are 
posted. And so great is the confidence 
of the soldiers in this faithful surveil- 
lance that they obey its behests to the 
letter. 

But the greatest marvel that Dr. 
Seaman found was the absence of sick- 
ness in the hospitals. He says: "Con- 



3*6 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



spicuous by their absence were cases 
requiring operations for appendicitis, 
hernias, floating kidneys, etc. In- 
deed, during the entire summer I have 
not seen a single hernia or a laparatomy. 
The Japanese soldier has been taught 
how to treat his intestines; and, con- 
sequently, his intestines are now treat- 
ing him with equal consideration. His 
plain, rational diet is digested, metabo- 
lized, and assimilated. It is not an 
irritating, indigestible, fermenting mess, 
acting as a local irritant, and produc- 
ing gastritis and the long list of in- 
flammatory, intestinal processes, with 
which we were all so familiar in the 
hospital wards at Camp Alger, Chatta- 
nooga, Tampa, Cuba, Porto Rico, and 
Montauk Point in 1898." 

Major Seaman considers the effect of 
this easily digested ration, settled 
upon with extremest care, as the most 
important lesson of the war, as there 
were hardly a baker's dozen of medical 
cases that could be called digestive 
diseases. Comparing the Japanese ex- 
perience with our own recent army ex- 
perience, he continues: "But what can 
be expected of a government that, after 
its terrible lessons of 1898-99, still in- 
sists, especially in the tropics, of sub- 
sisting its army on a ration so rich and 
elastic (lovely term, that elastic), so 
elastic that, when in the emergency of 
war its elasticity is tested, it bursts its 
bands, and is found to consist of pork 
and beans and fermenting canned rub- 
bish that in six weeks prostrates 50 
per cent, of its 250,000 units with in- 
testinal diseases, and sends 3,000 to 
their last homes, to say nothing of the 
enormous number invalided and the 
75,000 pension claims?" 

In addition to this active care, the 
medical officer and fully equipped 
bacteriological experts are also found 
in camp, lecturing the men on sanita- 
tion and all the minute details of per- 
sonal hygiene, — how to cook, how to 
eat, when not to drink, to bathe, and 



even to the paring and cleaning of 
the finger nails, to prevent danger 
from bacteria. 

For the first six months of the war 
the loss from preventable diseases has 
been a fraction of 1 per cent. Think 
of the awful losses by "enteric" in the 
South African War or of our own losses 
in the Spanish-American War, where, 
in a campaign the actual hostilities of 
which lasted six weeks, the mortality 
from bullets and wounds was 268, while 
that from disease reached the appalling 
number of 3,862, — 70 per cent. 

The effect of the food put into 
soldiers' stomachs was forcibly, though 
negatively, shown at the close of our 
Civil War. Our surgeons noted that 
the Confederate wounded who fell into 
their hands, recovered from their 
wounds in a surprisingly quick and 
uncomplicated manner. They sought 
an explanation, and found it in the 
fact that the South had become so 
impoverished that the ration had be- 
come reduced to simple "hog and 
hominy," and that the home people 
could no longer send boxes of health- 
destroying "goodies" to the men at 
the front. 

A large number of English soldiers 
under Lord Wolseley marched over a 
part of the ground now occupied by 
the "Cape to Cairo Railroad." They 
made it with remarkably few cases of 
sickness, and Lord Wolseley attrib- 
uted the exemption as the result of 
the cold tea that filled their canteens. 
Every laundress understands the thirst- 
quenching power of cold tea, when per- 
spiring over the ironing-board; and 
there are not wanting signs that, if the 
army of rheumatics could learn what to 
eat and what to avoid, their sufferings 
would be greatly diminished. 

As soon as Lord Wolseley's men 
struck a town where intoxicants could 
be obtained, there were cases of sick- 
ness. Yes, food and health are in- 
dissolubly linked.

Qubry 967*— Mrs. E K. P., White Rock, 
So. Dak. : " My boys are inclined to be delicate 
and subject to colds, and I have felt that our 
food might be deficient in fat. Good cream 
is not often obtainable, and, while we eat 
plenty of butter, I understand melted butter 
in vegetables is not healthful I do not know 
how to use salad oil except in salads, which 
we rarely use. Can you give helpful hints in 
this direction?" 

Fat in Food 

We are convinced that a free use of 
fatty foods during the cold season, 
other conditions being right, is a -pre- 
ventive of colds and catarrhal affec- 
tions. Butter is not particularly un- 
wholesome, melted by the heat of the 
cooked vegetable upon which it may 
be served. Raised to a higher temper- 
ature, it certainly loses in digestibility, 
to say the least. Olive oil is well 
adapted to cooking purposes, as it may 
be heated to 6oo° F. without burn- 
ing. Ordinary cooking in fat is car- 
ried on at a temperature 200 lower. 
Thus with care in cooking, if olive oil 
be used as the medium of conveying 
heat, fried food may be used occasion- 
ally without detriment to health. At 
the same time fried food is not to be 
depended on, to any extent, as a means 
of introducing fat into the system. 
There are better means. Olive oil may 
be used in place of butter on vege- 
tables and beefsteak. It should be 
added after the article is disposed in 



the serving-dish. It may also be used 
with macaroni and rice. Bacon cooked 
in the oven, as indicated in the recipe on 
page 308, is most wholesome. So also 
is the fat tried out from bacon, if it 
has not been discolored by strong heat. 
Such fat is most excellent, hot or cold, 
on bread, and on cereals, served as a 
vegetable with meat, rather than as 
a sweetened dish for breakfast. Occa- 
sionally, any cereal mush neatly cut, 
rolled, in flour, and fried in bacon fat, 
at a proper temperature, may be eaten 
with good relish and without digestive 
disturbance. Corn-meal and oatmeal 
contain a goodly proportion of fatty 
element. 

Nuts eaten at the mid-day meal and 
properly chewed are a wholesome and 
suitable form in which to take a por- 
tion of the fat needed at this season. 
Occasionally, a cake in which nuts are 
used or a cup of cocoa at the mid-day 
meal will not come amiss, and both 
are articles that young people will de- 
light in. A taste for French dressing 
on cold cooked vegetables, baked beans, 
string beans, lima beans, turnips, etc., 
may be easily acquired ; and fat in this 
way may be presented without fear of 
adverse criticism. 

Beef suet in steamed puddings will 
meet with favor on Saturdays, when 
skating and coasting call the young 
folk into the open air.

QuBry 968. — Mrs H. M. Martin, Reno, 
Nev : "Recipe for muffins and other articles 
for Rocky Mountain cookery published some 
time ago in Boston Cooking-School Magazine" 

Mountain Muffins 

Mix and sift two and one-half cups 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, one-half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Add 
three-fourths a cup of milk, two eggs, 
beaten until thick and lemon-colored* 
and two tablespoonfuls of melted butter. 
Bake in gem-pans, in a moderate oven, 
twenty-five minutes. 

Ginger Cakes 

To one-half a cup of Porto Rico 
molasses add one-half a cup of sour 
milk, one egg t well beaten, and three- 
fourths a cup of sugar. Mix and sift 
two cups of flour, one-half a teaspoon- 
ful of soda, one teaspoonful of ginger, 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon, and one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of clove. Combine 
mixtures, and bake in gem-pans in a 
slow oven. 

Mountain Sponge 

Make a syrup of three-fourths a cup 
of sugar and three tablespoonfuls of 
water by cooking together ten minutes. 
Cool, and pour gradually over the yolks 
of three eggs, which have been beaten 
until thick and lemon-colored, beating 
all the time, and continue the beating 
fifteen minutes. Add one and one- 
eighth cups of flour, one teaspoonful 
of lemon juice, and the whites of three 
eggs beaten until stiff and dry. Bake 
in a loaf, in a moderate oven, three- 
quarters of an hour. 

Orange Cake 

Cream three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, and add one-half a cup of sugar. 
Beat two eggs until thick and lemon- 
colored, and add one-fourth a cup of 
sugar. Combine mixtures. Mix and 
sift one and one-half cups of flour. 
Add one teaspoonful of baking-powder, 



and add to the first mixture, alter- 
nately, with one-half a cup of milk. 
Flavor with one-half a teaspoonful of 
orange extract, bake in gem-pans, and 
frost with golden frosting. For this 
take the yolks of two eggs, beat slightly, 
add sugar until thick enough to spread, 
and flavor with orange extract. The 
cake mixture may be baked in layer 
cake-pans, and put together with 
orange filling. This is made by cook- 
ing together, in a double boiler, one- 
half a cup of sugar, three tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, the juice of one orange, 
the grated rind of one-half an orange, 
one teaspoonful of lemon juice, one 
egg slightly beaten, and one teaspoon- 
ful of butter. Some of the filling may 
be saved for the top of the cake, or, 
if a more elaborate cake be desired, 
frost the top with egg frosting, and 
place sections of orange on top for a 
garnish. 

Query 969. — L. E. N., Sierra City, Cal.: 
"Can condensed milk or cream be made to 
whip, and how?" 

Whipping Evaporated Cream 

Have the cream thoroughly chilled 
before turning it from the can. By 
beating it steadily with a Dover egg- 
beater, the cream may be increased 
threefold in bulk in a very few minutes. 
Thus whipped, it may be used in Ba- 
varian creams and on top of cocoa. 
After standing a few minutes to stiffen, 
the top of the cream may be piped 
with a pastry bag and tube. Sugar 
should be added before beating.

part (in simmering water) of one 
pound of fresh meat, with or without 
bones. This broth needs never be 
concentrated, but it may be diluted. 
To secure this broth requires not over 
three cups of water to each pound of 
meat, without bone. When bone is 
used, which takes up at least one- 
fourth the entire weight, one pint of 
water to each pound of meat and bone, 
as sent from the market, will allow 
for evaporation and keep the correct 
proportion. When the broth is fin- 
ished, hot water may be added, if the 
number of pints of broth does not 
equal the number of pounds of meat 
used to secure the standard. This 
standard may then be diluted to suit 
individual tastes. A quart of soup 
will serve from four to six people.

Yeast Doughnuts 

Soften a cake of compressed yeast 
in one-fourth a cup of scalded-and- 
cooled milk, and stir into a cup of 
scalded-and-cooled milk. Stir in, also, 
about a cup and a half of flour. Beat 
this sponge thoroughly, cover, and set 



aside to become light. Then add one- 
third a cup of melted butter, one cup 
of sugar, two eggs, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and flour enough to make a 
dough (between two and three cups). 
Knead until the dough is elastic, then 
cover and set aside to become light. 
Roll into a sheet, cut in strips, and 
twist the strips. Dredge the board

Qubry 973. — A. C, Washington, D.C : 
"Recipes for making the Swedish timbale 
cases shown in August-September magazine, 
grape-fruit salad, dill pickles, and vinaigrette 
sauce that can be used on sheep's head-" 

Swedish Timbale Cases 

Sift three-fourths a cup of flour 
and half a teaspoonful of salt into 
a bowl, and drop the yolks of two eggs 
into the flour, then gradually add half 
a cup of milk, and mix the ingredients 
to a batter. Let stand an hour or 
more in a cool place before using. 
Let the iron become hot in the fat, 
then dip it into the batter to three- 
fourths its height, return to the fat, 
and cook the batter. If the cases 
lack in crispness and are thick and 
soft, more milk is needed. In the 
illustration referred to, the edge of 
the cases was brushed over with white 
°f e ggi and then dipped in fine-chopped 
parsley. This decorating is done just 
before filling. 

Grape-fruit Salad 

Cut the grape-fruit in halves. With 
a sharp, pointed knife cut close to the 
membrane in each section, and take 
out the pulp in neat pieces. For a 
fruit of medium size mix two table- 
spoonfuls of oil, half a tablespoonful of 
lemon juice or cider vinegar, one- 
eighth a teaspoonful of salt, and a 
dash of paprika. Stir these until

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



evenly blended, then pour over the 
prepared grape-fruit, and turn the 
fruit over very carefully with a silver 
or 'wooden spoon and fork, and dispose 
in a dish lined with delicate leaves of 
lettuce, carefully washed and dried. 
The lettuce may be previously dressed 
with a similar mixture of oil and con- 
diments, if the quantity given prove 
no more than is needed to dress the 
fruit, or the dish may be garnished 
with a little mayonnaise dressing. 

Dill Pickles 

Make a brine that will float an egg. 
To this add half as much more water 
as brine. Wash young and small 
cucumbers, or larger ones cut in pieces, 
in cold water. Use a stone jar. Put 
in first a layer of cucumbers, then a 
layer of washed grape leaves, and a 
layer of dill branches. Continue these 
layers until the jar is full. Pour the 
brine over the whole, and cover with 
a cloth, and then with a plate bearing 
a . weight. Remove the cloth, and 
wash frequently. 

Vinaigrette Sauce 

Have ready a teaspoonful, each, 
of fine-chopped parsley and capers and 
half the quantity of chopped shallot. 
Mix a cup of olive oil, one-fourth a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pa- 
prika, with two tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar, to a smooth consistency, then add 
the chopped herbs. The quantity of 
the various herbs may be changed, and 
others may be substituted to suite 
the taste. Tarragon vinegar is often 
preferred to plain cider vinegar, and 
the bowl may be rubbed over with 
the cut side of a clove of garlic before 
the ingredients are mixed in it.

stock (broth of chicken or veal or both, 
flavored with vegetables and sweet 
herbs), and stir constantly until smooth 
and boiling. When making veloute* 
sauce for fish, fish stock may be used. 

Creole Sauce 

Scald a green pepper, and wipe off 
the outer skin. Slice half of the 
pepper, discarding veins and seeds. 
Slice an onion rather thin, and saut6 
the onion and pepper in three table- 
spoonfuls of butter without browning 
them. Add a clove of garlic, well 
crushed, and stir for a moment. Then 
gradually stir in one cup of brown 
stock (broth made from beef, flavored 
with vegetables and sweet herbs). Let 
simmer gently about twenty minutes. 
In the mean time scald two large to- 
matoes, and remove the skin. Cut in 
halves, and press out the seeds. Cut 
the pulp in coarse pieces, and add to 
the sauce. Let cook about twenty 
minutes. Season with salt and pepper;

Menus for 35 Cents per Day 

Thirty-five cents per day is ample to 
supply a variety of good wholesome 
food for one individual, but thought 
and care needs be given to the selec- 
tion and preparation of the food. 
Roasts and broiled meats can be fur- 
nished only on rare occasions. Ex- 
ception might be made of roast leg of 
lamb, which spends well. Boiled ham, 
cold and in made dishes, is most use- 
ful. It is capable of manipulation in 
dishes of all kinds of texture and make- 
up, and it also keeps well, thus allow- 
ing of intervals between its appear- 
ance and reappearance. Baltimore 
samp, eaten as a vegetable, either with 
chopped parsley and cream sauce or 
meat broth, is, on account of its high 
fuel value, well adapted to the winter 
season. Cheese may be combined with

The Old Biblical Term suggests Good Food 

Such remarkable changes can be 
brought about by food properly selected 
that the best physicians now look to 
the rearrangement of a person's diet 
as one df the most important things. 

A member of the Clinic Publishing 
Company, publishers of medical jour- 
nals in Chicago, writes as follows, and 
says that he does not object to our 
using his name publicly: — 

"I wish to state a few facts which 
will show to you why there is, and ever 
will be, in my heart a most grateful 
appreciation of Grape-nuts as a life- 
giving, nerve-strengthening, and health- 
restoring food. 

' 'My eldest son, William R., was taken 
with a severe attack of scarlet fever. 
This left him in a state of such utter 
collapse and prostration of nerve force 
and energy that he was unable to sus- 
tain his own weight. 

' 'A complication of troubles followed. 
The kidneys became affected, and the 
doctors all declared his. case hopeless. 

"Naturally, the stomach was too en- 
feebled to retain or assimilate solid 
food, and milk, beef tea, and the like 
soon became nauseating to him. 

' 'Simply as an experiment, a spoonful 
of Grape-nuts was suggested and tried. 
Its predigested constituents seemed to 
exactly suit my boy's case. Eureka ! 
We had indeed found it. 

"He not only retained the food, but 
relished it and asked for more. From 
that very day he began to mend, 
and in three weeks was convalescent. 
Gradually from mere skin and bones 
Will has grown ruddy, bright-eyed, 
and manly, weighing now, at fifteen 
years of age, over one hundred and 
thirty pounds. 

"Can you wonder that in our family 
Grape-nuts is considered almost as 
'manna from heaven'?" William R.

tatoes, cabbage, cauliflower, and cel-

use of certain articles of food, let her 
endeavor to overcome such feelings; 
but, if any food really disagrees with 
one, avoid it by all means. Remem- 
ber, however, that a piece of cold,

softened by gentle heat and made less

great effort to plan good meals for a 
day.

To handle Men 

To do so Successfully, One must acquire 
Self-control 

A foreman in a great locomotive 
works tells how he acquired self-con- 



trol after it had been lost through the 
coffee habit: — 

"I find myself obliged to write you 
about Postum Coffee," he premises. 
"I have been a great tea and coffee 
drinker for over forty years, and can 
say that it made me almost a total 
wreck. I am a night foreman in the 
American Locomotive Company, and 
have to take my dinner with me, also 
a bottle of tea or coffee. In time it 
got to be so that there was not a night, 
for over a year, but that I would have 
a headache or heartburn or both. I 
went to the doctors almost every week 
to see if they could do something for 
me. They said it was the tobacco 
habit that did the mischief. 

"So I gave up tobacco, but it did 
not help me any. I got so nervous 
that the men under me did not like to 
work for me, as I could not use them 
as men ought to be used. I was ner : 
vous, irritable, and would find fault all 
the time. 

"Two months ago I took dinner with 
some friends who gave me what I sup- 
posed was a cup of coffee. They ex- 
plained that it was Postum Coffee, and 
my friend's wife said that she had used 
it about six months and that during 
that time had no headache such as she 
was formerly subject to, and that she 
felt so well all the time. That evening 
I took a package of Postum home with 
me, and began using it. 

"The result proved that the doctors 
were wrong: it was not tobacco, but 
tea and coffee that upset me so. Dur- 
ing the two months that I have used 
Postum I have had neither headache 
nor heartburn, my nervousness has left 
me, and I have gained fourteen pounds 
in weight. 

"Use this if you want to, as I have 
got twenty-four families to drinking 
Postum instead of coffee. They saw 
what it had done for ine." Name given 
by Postum Company, Battle Creek, 
Mich.

the boiling-point, the albumen in the 
egg coagulates and imprisons whatever 
is mixed with it, and, the mass being 
heavy, settles, leaving a clear decoc- 
tion. Since the white of an egg is 
nearly pure albumen and the yolk con- 
tains a large percentage of other bodies 
than albumen, which do not coagulate 
and are of no use in clearing coffee, we 
see no reason why the latter should be 
used at all. For many uses the yolk 
of an egg is more valuable than the 
white, and it should be kept for such 
uses. Egg shells are often used for 
clearing coffee, but these have no virtue 
for this purpose, other than that of 
the white which clings to them. 

Nut-and-Fruit Confections 
Chop fine one pound, each, of figs 
and English walnut meats, and half 
a pound, each, of dates and candied 
cherries. Work with the hands to a 
smooth mass, and roll out into a thin 
sheet on a board well dredged with 
confectioner's sugar. Shape with a 
small cutter, then roll in sugar. 

Lemon Jelly Served in Fruit Cups 
If jelly is to be served in orange 
cups, one would naturally use the juice 
removed in fashioning the cups for the 
jelly. This might be moulded in the 
orange skins, held in an upright posi- 
tion in a pan of crushed ice, so quickly 
that the bitter element would not be 
extracted. At the same time the dish 
would be quite as pretty, and more 
easily prepared, if the jelly were moulded 
in a shallow pan and cut in small 
cubes. A short time before serving 
put these into the cups fashioned from 
the orange skins.

cream of celery soup, turbans of halibut, po- 
tatoes malt re d'hote), fish Bechamel sauce, 
lamb, Creole style, an Italian cheese dish, and 
burnt almond charlotte russe. " 

Cream of Celery Soup 
Cook three cups of celery — leaves 



and outside stalks — and half an onion, 
until the vegetables are tender, and 
press through a sieve. There should 
now be about two cups of liquid and 
pulp. Melt one-fourth a cup of butter, 
and cook in it one-fourth a cup of flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash 
of paprika. Cook and stir while a pint 
of milk is gradually added. Let sim- 
mer two or three minutes, then add 
the celery liquid, and salt and pepper 
as needed. The beaten yolks of two 
eggs, mixed with half a cup of cream, 
may be added, when more nutriment is 
desirable. 

Turbans of Halibut 
For eight turbans purchase two slices 
of halibut, cut less than half an inch 
thick. Remove skin and bone. Roll 
the fillets thus taken out in olive oil 
or melted butter, and season with salt, 
pepper, onion, and lemon juice. Be- 
ginning at the widest end, roll up each 
fillet and fasten with a wooden tooth- 
pick, dipped in melted butter. Bake 
about twenty minutes, basting two or 
three times with the liquid in the pan, 
reinforced with a little butter melted 
in hot water. Dispose in a circle on 
a hot platter. Fill in the centre with 
potato balls, cut with French cutter, 
and boiled and dressed with chopped 
parsley. Serve fish Bechamel sauce 
in a dish apart.

Thb O. K. Household Expense Book. 

Cloth. Price 50 cents. Chicago: 

The Holtkamp Publishing Co. 

The Holtkamp Publishing Company 
of Chicago has just brought out 
"The O. K. Household Expense Book," 
which recommends itself as superior to 
other books of a similar character on 
the market for the following reasons : — 

Its columns are so arranged that the 
summing up of the daily and monthly 
expenditures is done from top to bot- 
tom (the natural way), while many 
others require horizontal adding, — a 
most unpractical way. It is provided 
with a "Daily Cash Balance" arrange- 
ment, permitting a cash balance to be 
struck in but a few seconds. Few, if 
any, of the other books published have 
even a single balance column. It is 
provided with ' ' Reference ' ' columns 
and lines where information and ex- 
planations may be recorded and almost 
instantly found. It is supplemented 



with very explicit "Directions," enab- 
ling even the most inexperienced house- 
keeper to keep the book in an abso- 
lutely correct manner. And last, but 
not least, the price is only 50 cents, 
which puts it within reach of a modest 
purse. It is neatly bound in gray 
cloth, with lettering in red, and, as the 
new year is the time to "reform," 
dealers should call attention to the 
value of this book.

The Management of Gas Cooking 
Ranges 

Keep the stove and all utensils 
scrupulously clean from top to bottom, 
inside and out. 

All loose fittings in the oven should 
be frequently removed and thoroughly 
cleansed. Strong hot soda and water, 
with scouring soap, should be used. 

Use pots and pans for boiling as 
broad and flat as possible, to utilize 
the heat to the best advantage. Keep 
them free from loose dirt outside. Do 
not use a pan that has been on a coal 
fire without first scraping and scouring 
it. 

Do not boil a quart of water when 
you only need a pint. It wastes gas. 
Do not let your pans or kettles boil 
over, or the burners will get choked 
and rusty, but turn down the gas as 
soon as the contents boil. This saves 
gas as well as saving the mess. 

Heating the Oven. — Let your oven get 
full hot before commencing to bake, 
and then put as much into the oven 
as possible, so as to save gas. After 
the first quarter of an hour or twenty 
minutes, turn down the oven burners: 
you will only spoil the food and waste 
the gas if you forget this. An excep- 
tion must be made when cooking puff 
pastry. Keep up the full heat then 
until finished. 

The hottest part oj the oven is that near 
the top, and the best results will be 
obtained with a grid shelf instead of 
a solid one, which may cause the food 
to burn. When opening the oven door, 
keep your head on one side, to avoid 
the heat. 

Meat or jowls should be hung or 
placed on a grid shelf. Always keep

ful attention to this point will save 
much money in the course of a year. 

Be careful not to turn on the oven 
tap in mistake for a boiling burner. 
Accidents have happened through the 
oven filling with gas and an explosion 
occurring when the oven is opened. 

Always have your light ready and 
the oven door open before turning on 
the gas. 

Used with reasonable care, gas for 
cooking is very economical, and it is 
always clean, convenient, and reliable.

The . bell in the parsonage rang. 
Master Harold went to the door, and 
found a couple, evidently from the 
country. "Is the pastor at home?" 
asked the young man. "Yes," said 
Harold. "Do you want to get mar- 
ried?" "That's just what we are 
here for," replied the bridegroom. 
"Well, come right in then," said the 
boy, ushering them . into the parlor. 
"I'll tell papa and mamma. She'll 
be awful glad to see you, for she gets 
the money. I heard her tell pa this 
morning she hoped some folks would 
come soon because she wants a new 
hat." — New York Press.

IS SILVER CLEANING 
A BVGBEAB 

and does your silver often go unclean ed because 
you dread the rub, rob, rub, of polishing it, the eyes 
fall of flying powder, and, at the end, the silver each 
time a little duller than when it came home new ? 
T A11 this work is now ended. " Silverease " is a new 
scientific preparation which cleans the silver without 
any trouble on your part. It is in the form of a 
powder to be dissolved in a pan of hot water. All 
the silver is placed in the pan at once, and in from 
five to ten minutes it is ready to put away, bright 
and sparkling as when it left the store. 
T " Silverease " is as harmless as soap. Silver, sterling 
or plated, can remain in it for months without the 
slightest harm. 

^f Practically every one who has tried it has immedi- 
ately sent not only an order, but an enthusiastic 
commendation. One user (name on request) wrote : 

" Housekeepers owe vera a debt of everlasting gratitude 
for revolutionizing the silver cleansing process. The 
facility with which silver can now be cleaned is truly 
"Silverease." Scouring is the vanishing shadow of the 
Dark Ages. I always hoped there' d come a wiser day, 
when silver could be more readily and more sensibly 
cleansed. You have solved the riddle." 

If your druggist or grocer doesn't keep " Silverease," send 

twenty-five cents to us and his name, and we will send you 

the package, and make you a very interesting offer ; or 

send two-cent stamp for a small sample.

A POUND OF CURE 



Poland Water costs 18 cents per quart 
White Rock costs 20 cents per quart 
Apollinaris costs 20 cents per quart 
French Vichy costs 25 cents per quart 
BECAUSE THEY ARE PURE 



IF your family drinks all it requires of these 
waters, in a year it means the expenditure 
of a good deal of money. Our proposition is 
much less expensive and more convenient. 

It consists of our improved Pasteur method 
of filtration, which renders water from any 
source of supply as pure and clear as a virgin 
spring, — purer, in fact, because it is not con- 

« 

taminated by handling, as may be spring 
waters in carboys. 

There is no other method of filtration that 
compares with ours. 

The pure water slowly forces its way by 
gravity through the tiny pores of the porcelain 
tubes, and the smallest, most minute germ 
known to science, has to stay on the other 
side. 

Pure drinking-water cannot be had by any 
other method of filtration. Write for our 
booklet.

The Origin of Pumpkin 

Once upon a time, a long while ago, 
there lived a wise old man who was 
always trying to see what he could dis- 
cover. 

Having made several perpetual mo- 
tion machines and one or two airships, 
he was walking through the fields to 
avoid^his creditors, when heVamejipon 
a pumpkin. 

* 'This," he said to himself, bending 
down and feeling of the yellow orb, 
" is a vegetable growth; but I firmly 
believe that it acquires its hue from 
small particles of gold which it ex- 
tracts from the earth." 

So he took the pumpkin on his 
shoulder, and took it home, telling all 
anxious inquirers that he was going 
to discover how to extract the gold 
from it. 

At home, in spite of all his wife said, 
he cut the pumpkin up and put it in 
a pot and boiled it, only he argued 
that he was melting it. 

When at last it was a pulpy mass, he 
poured it out of the pot and right on 
top of a pan of dough that his wife had 
rolled out for the purpose of making 
a dried-apple pie. 

Now you know the kind of a wife he 
had, do you not ? A woman who will 
feed her husband on dried-apple pie 
deserves to be married to two or three 
inventors, doesn't she ? 

And so he put the pumpkin and the 
dough into the oven, asserting that he 
would harden it with the heat and 
produce^ajsolid sheet of gold, and be 
so rich that he could run for office on 
a reform ticket. 

But, bless you! when the pumpkin 
and the dough came out of the oven,

it was not a solid sheet of gold at all, 
but a rich, golden, tantalizing section 
of goodness. 

And the poor inventor was hungry 
so he bit into it. 

A few moments later several of his 
creditors broke into the house, and 
came upon him, crying: "Look here! 
Where is all that gold you were going 
to get for us?" 

And he never even looked up at 
them, but kept right on eating, saying: 
"Who cares for gold? (Bite, bite. 
O-o-o-oh !) Who cares for gold ? Men, 
I have discovered pumpkin pie!" 

And the creditors sat down also and 
ate; and they, too, were happy ever 
after. 

So now, when you eat pumpkin pie, 
you should be glad that the poor inven- 
tor did not succeed in making gold 
of the pumpkin. For, if he had, 
the pumpkin might never have gone 
further than to fill your teeth. — Judge.

Right Living 

The Fourth " R " in Education 

THE new education add* a fourth "R" to 
reading, 'riling, and 'rithmetk,— Right Living. 
This In equally important to men and to somen, 
but, as our living centres in the home, the subject 
is of greatest interest to women, the home-makers. 

The basis of this right living is Hygiene, all that 
makes for health, — personal hygiene, healthful sur- 
roundings, healthful food, cooking, and clothing, care 
of the sick, and right care of children, etc. Then 
comes the Economy of Living, true economy of 
time, effort, and expenditure, system and wise man- 
agement of the affairs of the household, accounting, 
buying, convenient houses, etc.; and, most important, 
the children, whose health, character, and life success 
are so largely determined in the home- 
Very few know of the tremendous advances that 
have been made during tbe last ten years in system* 
atized knowledge dealing with this subject. Tbe 
announcement of the American School of House- 
hold Economics tells of this Interesting new education, 
and huw it may be obtained at home at small expense.

"The exercise of intelligence, judg- 
ment, or skill in any labor gives satis- 
faction. Putting one's mind into one's 
work, so that attention is keen and 
every effort well directed, is a prime 
source of joy in work, no matter what 
the work may be." — President Eliot, in 
The World's Work. 



The Worcester Gazette says that the 
dividend of 18 per cent, on a capital 
of $25,000 declared by the night lunch 
cart company of that city is a pretty 
small profit in comparison with that 
made by the same carts in the early 
days of the industry. Three or four 
hundred per cent., it says, was not at 
all uncommon, and one of the pioneers 
boasted that he started without any 
capital, and made over $10,000 in a few 
years' time. A man named Scott 
(possibly the "Great Scott" we hear 
so much about) originated the lunch 
cart in Providence, R.I., but it was 
perfected and developed in Worcester; 
and now there is a chain of lunch carts 
from Bangor, Me., to Denver, Col. —

Children of Cherry-blossom Land 



By Jessie Juliet Knox 



TO one acquainted with the 
creamy tots of cherry -blos- 
somed Japan there comes the 
ever-recurring question, "Why are 
they so preternaturally good and obedi- 
ent, such models of etiquette and dig- 
nity?" Perhaps no one can tell just 
whv, for the answer lies centuries back, 
and one can only guess at some of the 
reasons. 

If one visits a Japanese home, the 
children therein are a never-ending 
source of wonderment; for from ohyo 
(good -day) to sayonara (good-bye), 
both of which are accompanied with 
serio-comic prostrations of their lithe 
little bodies, they are perfect paragons 
of politeness and obedience. What 
would seem to an American to fore- 
bode the ruin of a child's disposition 
has just the opposite effect on a Japa- 
nese child. For instance, they are given 
so much attention, parents are so in- 
ordinately fond of their offspring, they 
take them everywhere, holding them 
by the hand, and displaying their 
charms to an admiring host of friends. 
They enter heartily into their games, 
also, and keep them constantly sup- 
plied with new toys. Besides, children 
are never excluded from the conversa- 
tion of adults; but this does not make 
them over-precocious or pert. Parents 



do not threaten or hold punishment 
over their heads, and punishment in- 
deed seems unnecessary. They are 
taken to picnics and like festivities, 
and no occasion is considered complete 
without their presence. 

Boys are preferred, but no difference 
is shown in the love and attention be- 
stowed upon the two sexes. It is an 
odd sight to see numerous children, 
not more than five or six years old, 
carrying, tightly strapped to their 
backs, little baby brothers or sisters, 
the tiny heads wobbling back and forth 
with the violent undulations of the 
diminutive nurse. Her movements are 
not at all impeded by her burden, how- 
ever; for she hops, skips, and runs 
just the same. 

The children of Japan are indeed 
beautiful, and most picturesque in their 
gay kimonos. They have a creamy 
skin, with cheeks of rose, black slant- 
ing eyes, cunning little retrouss£ noses, 
and laughing scarlet mouths, full of 
pearly teeth, lithe, graceful bodies, and 
a thousand irresistible witcheries of 
manner. Who could resist them? 

At the age of three years the omni- 
present kimono is donned, and, al- 
though picturesque, it is certainly not 
convenient either for them or their 
elders. It is not easy to carry on child- 



334 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



ish sports thus handicapped ; but, fort- 
unately, they do not play roughly, like 
the children of other nations. As far 
as dress is concerned, it is difficult to 



them look top-heavy. At the age of 
ten the crown alone is shaven, and a 
forelock is worn. When a boy becomes 
fifteen, he then takes on the responsi- 



distinguish boy from girl, as both wear 
kimonos. The sleeves are large and 
square, extending to the knee. These 
are used instead of pockets for the stor- 
ing of everything conceivable. The 
girls carry dolls and such feminine be- 
longings in their sleeves, and the boys 
have tops, balls, and many other things 
dear to the heart of the child mascu- 
line. One very sensible thing always 
found somewhere in a baby's kimono 
is a metal ticket, with the name and 
address of the tiny wearer engraved 
thereon, precluding all danger of being 
lost. 

The style of dressing the hair is pe- 
culiar, the boys' heads being smooth- 
shaven until the age of three. Then 
they wear a tuft behind each ear and 
one on top of the head. This gives 
a most peculiar appearance, and makes 



bilities of a man, and his hair is al- 
lowed to grow like that of a man. 

There are many styles of dressing a 
girl's hair, and her age may be told by 
the way in which it is dressed. Some 
of their coiffures are very artistic, and 
often vivid chrysanthemums (kiku) are 
placed over each tiny ear, which is, in- 
deed, most becoming. 

As to the food of a Japanese child, 
it consists mainly of rice and tea. The 
rice is well boiled, and is always eaten 
hot morning and noon, and for supper 
cold, with hot tea poured over it. Tea- 
drinking begins at the age of two years. 
On festive occasions the children are 
allowed to have fruit and some kind of 
pickles, which are considered most de- 
sirable, and are eaten mixed with the 
rice. They do not drink milk, for the 
Japanese believe that whoever shall 



Children of Cherry-blossom Land 



335 



drink the milk of a cow will sooner or 
later sprout horns. Perhaps the deli- 
cacy that most appeals to the palate 
of a Japanese child is the preserved 
radish, which is kept in a jar of salt 
and rice bran. 

The Japanese virtue that exceeds all 
others is filial piety, obedience without 
question. A disobedient or ill-bred 
child is held in the greatest abhorrence 
by all classes of Japanese. The chil- 
dren are subject to perfect obedience 
at home, which facilitates matters for 
the school-teacher, who has no trouble 
at all on that score. The effect of this 
harmonious home life follows the chil- 
dren everywhere, and all their games 
and amusements are without discord. 
They are guided, not by fear of punish- 
ment, but by love. They eat no meat, 
and their whole lives may be said to be 
spent out of doors. These things, and 
many more, contribute, of course, to 
their docility and gentleness of nature, 



courteous retorts. Nothing can exceed 
their dignity and self-possession, and 
by the time they have reached the age 
of ten they are never at a loss as to 
just what to do and what not to do on 
every occasion. If they are where can- 
dies or similar things are passed, they 
do not eagerly grasp them as an Ameri- 
can child would be inclined to do, but 
first must have permission from parents 
or others, and then they will offer them 
to every one else in the room before 
partaking themselves. It is not good 
form to refuse anything, and what has 
been put upon the plate must disappear. 
If it cannot be eaten, it is slipped into 
the large sleeve. 

Japanese girls are named after 
flowers, minerals, seasons, trees, and 
shrubs. The prefix "O" signifies 
higher class, and means "honorable." 
Little girls may usually be seen about 
the house, with babies strapped to 
their backs, after school is out. It was

quarrel, but the point is settled by the 
decision of the eldest child. 

The school life of a Japanese child is 
not neglected, however, despite all his 
pleasures. Early in the morning you 
may see these picturesque tots wending 
their way to school, armed with copy- 
book, Japanese umbrella, and rice jar. 
The school-room is dainty, with its white 
matting and bright -colored futons, or 
squares of wadded silk, upon which to 



Writing is done with water and 
India ink, which makes the copy-books 
so wet that they have to be spread all 
over the yard to dry. The school- 
master often takes the children for 
lovely walks after school, when they are 
frequently refreshed with hot tea at the 
different tea-houses. On going home 
from school, the children have their 
evening meal, then play, and after- 
ward study. 



Children visiting the Temple of Nikko 



kneel. The books are kept in small 
chiffonniers, also ink and brushes. 
When the teacher arrives, all the school 
is supposed to be assembled, to bid him 
good-morning in a body. When they 
hear him coming, they bow to the 
ground, exclaiming, Okyo (Good-day) 
and Irraskai (Enter!) and many 
other greetings. He profusely thanks 
them for their good wishes, and hopes 
they are all well. 



As a farewell glimpse, we will look in 
on them thus. It is all so beautiful, — 
the white matting, the rows of shining 
lanterns swinging picturesquely over- 
head, and the sweet child faces, full of 
dimples and innocent laughter; and, as 
they go to their beds of soft wadded 
crepe and a wooden pillow, we will 
whisper, Sayonara (Good-bye), to 
these charming tots of cherry-blossom 
land. 



A Dinner in Bohemia 

By Helen Campbell 




LL I want/' the girl said, 
"is to see for myself. My 
father insists that there isn't 
any more a Bohemia in New York, 
that it went out with Pfaff's beer- 
cellar, where Fitz James O'Brien and 
Fitz Hugh Ludlow and all that famous 
tribe, Walt Whitman included, talked 
immortal talk over mugs of beer from 
midnight to dawn. They are all gray- 
beards now, if alive at all, which most 
of them are not. But yesterday Mac- 
pherson, the new man in pastels, you 
know, told me, at a private view, of a 
place where you can really dine with 
exiles and anarchists." 

"Why, in the name of wonder, should 
you want to dine with exiles and an- 
archists?" 

The young man's eyes were on her, 
smiling, yet puzzled ; and now the girl 
smiled also, vet with a touch of con- 
descension, her charming face express- 
ing a general hopelessness of making her 
meaning clear. 

"You ought to know. You are two- 
thirds anarchist yourself, I believe, and, 
I do not doubt, know all about it. So 
you have no good reason for not tak- 
ing me.'.' 

Again the young man considered her 
gravely. 

"To what end? Have you not bur- 
rowed enough in places where you do 
not belong? Why is it that this gene- 
ration is doing all the things its mothers 
never even thought of, and even now 
would not venture upon ? Fancy your 
mother at an anarchist table d'hote!" 

"Yes, but mamma has no dramatic 
instinct. I should say the last gene- 
ration were almost all made up without 
it, save one here and there, who, if they 
did not find outlet for it on the stage, 
suffered tortures all their days from 
perpetual misunderstandings. Mamma 



now wants life according to fixed rule. 
I, on the contrary, want it with a flavor. 
It is all part of a general study of 
humanity, you know. Now there cer- 
tainly is, perhaps, not the old, but a 
new, Bohemia." 

"An imitation Bohemia, ves. A Bo- 
hernia where, as a witty newspaper 
man said the other day, 'uninteresting 
people go to see people who are not 
there,' — places where a famous artist 
or writer has gone between checks, and 
his followers flocked there in conse- 
quence. You don't want a make- 
believe Bohemia, child." 

"I don't want Bohemia at all. I 
want to see the place that Macpherson 
knows and says is just a big family, and 
the proprietor its patriarch, — a place 
where homesick foreigners, who have 
not made homes here, come because it 
is friendly and kind and gives them 
native dishes and native faces, and a 
place where they can speak what they 
think without fear. It is a dangerous 
part of the city, he says, though how it 
can possibly be any more dangerous 
than all the rest, with the subway 
going on, I can't see. The point is, 
will you take me, Hal? I don't want 
to go alone, but I might, perhaps, for 
lunch." 

The young man groaned, but it ap- 
peared to carry a sense of affirmative to 
the girl, who laughed again as he fixed 
questioning eyes upon her. 

"Poor Hal," she said, "you have 
been looking at me like that ever since 
I was three and you six. Will it al- 
ways go on?" 

"Always, I suppose; but you don't 
mind, and I may cease to be surprised. 
When shall it be? To-morrow?" 

So it came that the next dav found 
the pair leaving a car at Sixth Avenue 
and West Fourth Street, and, turning

presently from a deep-shaded old park, 
due south-west into a street filled with 
men hurrying from work, children as 
the sands of the sea, and a roar of 
sound, not alone from the elevated close 
at hand in a side street, but with organs 
pouring out rag-time music, and, added 
to this, the cries of innumerable venders 
of wares no man in his senses could 
possibly desire, till farther down be- 
fore a house, at the last extremity of 
forlornness, her guide turned, then led 
the way through a long hall, past a 
kitchen, from which savory odors 
steamed, out to a. yard long and nar- 
row, actually a bowling alley at one 
time, but now divided in half, its com- 
panion alley on the other side of a 
partition. 

The proprietor, a striking likeness of 
King Humbert, had advanced to meet 
them, bowing as he came, and led the 
way to the end of a long table crossed 
at the upper end by a second one, 
where, he whispered, sat the most 
famous exiles and patriots, giving them 
places so near that much of the con- 
versation could be overheard. 

11 What a fraud you are, Hal!" the 
girl said. "I knew you knew it all, but 
you feel it your duty to keep me in 
check. If you deceive me so now, 
what will you do when we are really 
married ?" But now she turned, for a 
little gong had sounded, and a line of 
waiters entered, bearing huge bowls of 
savory soup, from which each guest 
ladled for himself huge portions of rich 
gravy filled with all known vegetables. 
How it was eaten the girl could not 
tell, for every one talked, it seemed, 
steadily, save the three anarchists at 
the cross table, who spoke never a word, 
the Italian husband and wife at her 
left, smiling amiably and soon talking 
volubly, as they found she could follow 
them fairly well, pointing out first one 
and then another celebrity: a South 
American ex-minister of education talk- 



ing South American politics to an exiled 
Italian lexicographer, who at intervals 
defined the meaning of words ; a doctor 
farther down describing a new surgical 
instrument to a neighbor bent on prov- 
ing the necessity of a literary aristoc- 
racy, while waiting for the second 
course, polenta, otherwise corn-meal 
mush fried in thin slices, on each of 
which reposed a reed bird nominally, 
really a sparrow, heads and feet still 
on, as if they were minded to hop away 
on the moment. 

"It would be perfectly heartless to 
eat them," the girl said, "for you know 
I belong to the Audubon society." 
And she pushed back her plate and 
sipped a glass of red wine till the roast 
came, — a slice of veal flavored with 
sweet herbs, a touch of garlic, and a 
few drops of Burgundy, accompanied 
by a delightful salad, in which leeks 
and red vinegar and green Italian oil 
made a color scheme with all the rest. 
They had started with a mountain of 
plates, slowly reducing till there came 
the final cheese plate, with cup of black 
coffee and a little brandy to burn. And 
now there entered a pair of strolling 
musicians, with guitar and piccolo, deli- 
cate music, to which was paid the trib- 
ute of entire silence till the first number 
had been given, each guest then paying 
his share and asking for favorite ballad 
or some special solo, heard in Milan or 
Florence, it might be, from the lips of 
some famous artist. 

The tables were cleared speedily, and 
now games — chess, etc. — were brought 
out, cards at one end, and, through it 
all, unceasing talk. The pair slipped 
away quietly at last, hurrying up 
the crowded street to the quiet old 
square. 

"You don't mind, do you, Hal?" the 
girl said, as they crossed the square 
toward Sixth Avenue again. And the 
young man said, — 

"Not if you don't do it again." 



"Tired Mistakes 5 ' 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



HOW many of us wear ourselves 
out trying to correct mistakes 
we never would have com- 
mitted, if we had not been so tired! 
Who does not know the agonies of ac- 
counts, when the figures for a whole 
year will not agree with those for each 
past month! Wearied with excess of 
Christmas doings, we plunge into the 
New Year's ledger book to find all is 
wrong, because we are too tired to sub- 
tract when we should add, and when 
cash in hand is too much or too little, 
and check and bank book do not agree. 
This last difference one friend itemizes 
as "due to eccentricities of bank." 
If we had not been so tired, our ac- 
counts would not have been so criss- 
cross. 

And yet we have not been unfaithful 
in purpose, though failing every day. 
Surely, our difficulties with our personal 
accounts teach us to honor the vast 
numbers of book-keepers, clerks, cash- 
iers, whose petty cash and ledger books 
must be always right before they can 
go home, tired, to be with their fami- 
lies, who wish they were not so pre- 
occupied. 

Still, in spite of tired mistakes, we 
should go on correcting them and try- 
ing again. That is, we must have per- 
sonal enthusiasm over ourselves and 
our work, however trifling it be. "If 
my hand slacked," said Antonio Stra- 
divarius, "I should rob God, for God 
cannot make Antonio's violins without 
Antonio." It has been stated that one 
reason why Mrs. Julia Ward Howe has 
such vitality of physical frame and 
such marvelous intellectual strength is 
because she enjoys. So for us average 
people one of the ways of avoiding 
tired mistakes is to be willing — to 
enjoy. 



The world will never know, and per- 
haps we ourselves will never realize, 
why many mistakes are committed, 
though dire results often prove that 
they were real errors. Some twenty 
or more years ago an engrossing clerk, 
in copying a section of a tariff bill con- 
cerning articles to be admitted free of 
duty, accidentally changed the hyphen 
in the compound word "fruit-plants" 
to a comma, making it. read "all 
foreign fruit, plants, etc." As result 
of this simple mistake, the United 
States Government lost not less than 
$2,000,000. It is a simple semicolon 
which occurs in the law regarding the 
hours at which hotels shall cease to sell 
liquor, and which its opponents allege 
was a copyist's mistake, that has caused 
so much petitioning to the Massachu- 
setts legislature for and against re- 
taining that special punctuation mark. 
More than likelv the Boston and the 
Washington clerk were both "plain 
tired." 

As this article is being written, the 
possibility of reprieving the sentence 
of a woman murderer is said to depend 
upon the interpretation of punctuation 
in relation to a comma in a clause of 
a section of the Vermont Constitution 
defining the prerogatives of the gover- 
nor. Was the placing of that comma 
another tired mistake ? 

Again, a friend received a telegram 
asking to arrest some one who was sup- 
posed to be beyond reproach. The 
wife of the gentleman to whom the re- 
quest had been sent insisted that there 
must be a mistake, because the opera- 
tor might have been tired; and so it 
proved. The correct word was "as- 
sist." Fortunately, no harm was done 
in this case. 

Genealogical records are not always 



" Tired Mistakes " 



341 



trustworthy, for their transcribers get 
tired. A woman was long supposed to 
be a year older than she< really was in 
consequence of a tired entry of her 
birth in the family Bible. When it 
was discovered that she was truly a 
year younger than had been written, 
she at once grew ten years younger in 
appearance. 

Tired mistakes needlessly imbitter 
family life. When we have neuralgia, 
how we find fault with those who were 
not to blame! If. it i$ a good rule to 
sleep upon the desire to chastise be- 
fore inflicting punishment, how much 
better it is to be perfectly well before 
thinking of reproving some one ! Many 
a child has memories of unpleasant 
home scenes that never would have 
occurred, if parents had not been over- 
tired. 

If, as Robert Hunter says, "even 
in prosperous times not less than 
10,000,000 persons in the United States 
are under-fed, under-clothed, and poorly 
housed," it can well be doubted whether 
all of them care. For it is not the in- 
discriminate pauper who is most tired, 
but the man, woman, or child, who 
works hard and honestly from morning 
till night. They are born tired, live 
tired, and die tired. 

Never will it be known how many 
fatal accidents on railroads and in ma- 
chine shops are in consequence of this 
tiredness. One who is working can- 
not afford to say he is tired, lest he 
lose his job. How much bric-k-brac is 
broken in private houses, and how 
many dinners are spoiled, because 
workers are tired! 

What are we going to do about it 
all ? ( Sociologist and reformer, each has 
his remedy to propose, as to lessen im- 
migration, the number of births, the 
spread of tuberculosis, to make legis- 
lation minutely paternal. The physi- 
cian prescribes hypophosphate. The 
inventor has his patent medicine. The 
philosopher advises common sense, and 



the minister recommends faith or creed 
or both. Each remedy is good; but 
we who have scant leisure and little 
money, with neither brains nor time 
to effect wide results, have to take 
refuge in trying not to make tired mis- 
takes in our own homes. 

It should be a matter of home eco- 
nomics and personal religion not to 
get over-tired. Or, if we are, not to 
crucify ourselves by way of retaliation 
upon ourselves for unimportant mis- 
takes. If the cup is broken, because 
we were too dizzy to put it in its saucer, 
worrying over its breakage does not 
mend it. The item "sundries" in our 
account book is a non-committal hid- 
ing-place for errors that concern only 
ourselves. A child can wait for its re- 
proof. 

We can do without theatres, fine 
clothes, and expensive menus for the 
sake of rest. Then, when we have 
made mistakes, let us accept them, and 
begin again. The daily wretchedness 
in average homes, arising from consci- 
entious worrying over trifling mistakes, 
can well be set against the daily grind 
in other homes to gain the pittance for 
weekly food and rent. 

Pauperism is not lessened by be- 
wailing our mistakes. Most of us 
could be healthier if we chose. Even 
a narrow hall is not incompatible with 
being well, though it is with gentleman 
callers, for, as one minister puts it, 
"The boys and girls may have my 
church vestry in which to do their 
courting." 

The older we grow, the more fully 
do we realize that retrospects weaken 
instead of strengthen us, and that our 
minds react upon our bodies. It is for 
us to make the body react upon the 
mind. Personally, I have great faith 
in a few simple gymnastic movements 
before going to bed, then in going to 
sleep without thinking over my mis- 
takes, in a partly open window at 
night, in a sponge bath (if it cannot be 



34* 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



a tub bath, and for most of the world 
it cannot be as yet), and then in grape- 
nuts for breakfast. 

Some one else will have other and, 
perhaps, better specifics. Yet there is 
none, except the morbid, who will not 
acknowledge that unimportant mis- 
takes should be relegated to the limbo 



of forgetfulness, and that we must steer 
ourselves clear of tired mistakes by 
not getting Qver-tired, so that tired- 
ness may not become a chronic condi- 
tion. May we never be so perpetually 
weary that a child's kiss at night is 
either a bore or a something to be tol- 
erated ! 



The Mission of the Cook-book 

By Eliza Stowe Twitchell 



DR. EDWARD EVERETT 
HALE, whose mission in life 
seems to be to find some good 
in everything, used to point with 
whimsical pride to the mission of the 
fashion papers. Coming from one 
whose interest in dress and knowledge 
of the fashions was, to say the least, 
extremely limited, it was somewhat 
amusing to hear him dilate on the bless- 
ings of paper patterns. 

"What a service these paper patterns 
are, with their colored plates, to the 
country girls in far-away towns, who 
love pretty things, or to mothers of 
large families, who must make over the 
last season's garments of the older chil- 
dren for the younger members of the 
family ! Thanks to paper patterns, now 
my young lady, when she comes up 
fresh from the country to visit her city 
cousins, is arrayed in the latest style. 
What profound gratitude she must feel 
toward the makers and sellers of pat- 
terns, from the designers to the printers ! 
for all this attractiveness in dress adds 
much to her confidence in herself, and, 
in a measure, makes up for her simple- 
mindedness, or what might be termed 
her unsophisticatedness." In some 
such manner as this would he amuse 
himself and his listeners, by pointing 
out the benevolent mission of many a 



commercial enterprise, finding a dis- 
interested motive where others saw 
only a selfish business transaction. 

Much the same mission attaches it- 
self to the cook-book; yet there are 
those who have not yet awakened to 
the great educational and refining 
work of the cook-book, and who still 
sigh for the good old-fashioned recipes 
of their grandmothers. The only ac- 
counting for such perversity in the 
midst of advancing knowledge is that 
a born conservative will always re- 
main a conservative, even to the pre- 
ferring of his grandmother's cakes and 
puddings to those of his wife or sweet- 
heart. But those of us who are in 
the secret of chemical combinations, 
emphatic beatings, and careful stirrings, 
and who are blessed with sufficient 
courage to venture on a brand-new 
recipe once in a while, are wont to smile 
indulgently at so fulsome praise of our 
great-grandmothers and their superior 
"ways," for we know that much of this 
sentiment in things ancient is because 
"distance lends enchantment." 

The modern cook has a hundred 
combinations to our foremothers' one, 
as well as a much wider variety of 
materials to draw from, since to-day 
every climate on the globe contributes 
to our pantries, to say nothing of the

many labor-saving cooking utensils 
that make for righteousness, or light- 
ness, and ovens with correct-heating 
capacity, and easily adjusted for quick 
or slow service. 

True, the all-night bake in the huge 
brick ovens of the olden times gave a 
mellowness to pumpkin pies, puddings, 
and the brown loaf that cannot well be 
supplied by our gas ranges; and, then, 
what huge quantities were cooked at 
one time, especially just before Thanks- 
giving, — pies enough to last nearly the 
whole winter and pound cake in pro- 
portion ! It was the sight of this vast 
mountain of newly prepared food, 
which filled the air with its odor and 
the heart with thanksgiving for feasts 
to come, that still lingers so fondly in 
our memories. 

It would seem as if some of this food 
must have grown somewhat stale be- 
fore it was all eaten, however. Now- 
adays every Sunday dinner, in most 
families, is a royal thanksgiving feast. 
As Henry Ward Beecher used to say, 
"It is not that we have lost our old- 
fashioned Thanksgiving, but that every 
dinner approaches that feast of good 
things." But of course we cannot be 
expected to feel gratitude for all our 
blessings. We are too busy. 

Not all cook-books, however, aje 
written by inspiration. Neither do 
all recipes tend to our sanctification, 
chiefly those found in the columns of 
some of our daily papers, which are 
often quite on a par with the " Fashion" 
write-ups in the same, or the wise ad- 
vice given under the title of "Woman's 
Column." It would seem a fair guess 
to infer that much of this work must 
be done by young men just learning 
the art of journalism, and who are more 
interested in grammar and the con- 
struction of sentences, than in the ideas 
conveyed. What sorry advice they do 
give us, indeed ! But then no one thinks 
of following them. They were not 
written for that purpose, but to be read. 



But the cook-book is quite another 
thing. That has come to stay, and, 
like the family Bible, has a shelf of its 
own in every household; but, quite 
unlike the family Bible, it is read daily 
and consulted for direction and conso- 
lation on occasions of perplexity. And 
its never-failing advice on all subjects, 
from pickles to pie crust, though oft- 
times too expensive for some salaries, 
is nevertheless suggestive. And what 
more does a bright woman need than 
a good suggestion? With that she is 
master of the situation. 

There are those who have no need 
for cook-books. They are born gen- 
iuses, and can cook by intuition. Such 
people are rare, but they do exist. The 
writer has in mind now a sweet, 
sprightly young lady, whom even the 
most fastidious young man might 
safely marry and never once sigh for 
his mother's pies and things. 

Here is her recipe for sponge cake, 
and it's never failing, at least when 
she makes it. 

"I take four eggs, a cup of sugar, a 
little salt, and some flavoring." 

"Beat white and yolks separately?" 
"Oh, no, indeed. Just beat them hard 
awhile, and then I put in flour enough 
to make it quite stiff. Then I go to 
the faucet and turn in cold water 
enough to make it thin again. Put in 
just enough, and it's ready to bake. 
Easy, isn't it?" 

"Sometimes I bake it all in one loaf, 
and sometimes in small tins; and then 
they go off like hot cakes at home, 
when the boys are around." 

Her recipe for loaf cake was quite as 
simple, only she made it serve many 
purposes, — a sure mark of genius. At 
one time it turned out a layer cake, by 
being baked in two tins. Again, it was 
a thin cake spread with thick frosting, 
for those who preferred more frosting 
than cake. Then, again, it served the 
purpose of a choice fruit cake, by the 
addition of a cup of mixed fruits. Thus 



344 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



it kept the family well supplied with a 
variety of good things, simply by chang- 
ing its form, but not its substance. 

After saying so much in its favor, it 
were hardly fair to the weary, over- 
worked reader not to give the recipe 
for making so many easy and delightful 
things. So here it is in her own words. 
When tried, the failure, if any, 
will lie in the cook, and not in the 
recipe : — 

• 'I take two cups of flour, after it is 
sifted, two level tablespoonfuls of 
baking-powder, to which I add one 
scant cup of sugar. Then I break two 
eggs in a cup and fill the cup up with 
rich, sweet milk. Then I pour these 
in the flour, but do not stir until I have 
added one-half a cup of melted butter; 
that is, one-half a cup before melting. 
Stir or beat briskly, and it is ready for 
the oven; but do not forget to use 
pastry flour." 

The mission of the cook-book does 
not lie wholly in its service to common, 
daily life, but in its power to meet 



special occasions, becoming in turn 
the family lawyer, doctor, minister, 
and even a professor of domestic 
economy. 

What woman is there, with suf- 
ficient amount of feminine vanitv to 
be sweetly affectionate and graceful, 
who has not had her heart filled with 
gratitude for her cook-book, when she 
has beheld the crowning success of a 
newly tried recipe, and afterwards en- 
joyed the quiet approval of her guests 
by the bountiful supply which they 
managed to assimilate? For we all 
know the old adage, "The proof of the 
pudding is in the eating." 

A young bride would no more think 
of starting housekeeping, to-day, and 
expect to retain the love of her husband, 
without one or more good cook-books, 
than she would appear in his presence 
before secretly and artistically using 
that great beautifier, the curling iron. 
Of such are the things that make for 
civilization, adding tone to color, and 
quality to quantity. 



Home 

By Edith Livingston Smith 



To give a gift unto thy house 

Is but to give it unto thee. 

Thy presence there is mirrored strong, 

Thy touch is its entirety. 

And so to know thee more I come, 

With gifts to add to thy fair home. 



Thy household frames thy loveliness. 
Each present gives thee pleasure sweet 
Suppose my lady-one I give 
A gift more lasting, more complete. 
Suppose I make thee a new home : 
Oh, wilt thou as its spirit come? 



Then I and thou shall make a creed 
With Peace and Beauty as its words. 
We'll live it when the world outside 
Is filled with snow or summer's birds; 
When, gifts of Time, our children come, 
They'll learn of us that — Love is Home. 



Some Original Recipes — and Others 



By a Mere Man 



AS soup should come early in any 
/\ dinner, we will start with soup 
/ % here. Recipes for tomato bouil- 
lon, or clear tomato soups, are by no 
means unknown, but they are not com- 
mon enough to augur a frequent ap- 
pearance on the table. Did you ever 
make one ? Some day you will, or will 
like to have a variation from your ordi- 
nary brand. Then try this : — 

Tomato Printanier 

Take a sufficient quantity of strained 
stewed tomato juice, strong enough to 
give good flavor, but without enough 
pulp to make it opaque to any notice- 
able degree. Now do not add the in- 
evitable meat extract or any decoction 
of flesh, but instead simmer in it a 
touch of cayenne, trace of clove, same 
of coriander, ditto of allspice, and a 
small quantity of herbs to suit, with a 
quarter of a bay leaf. Above all, add 
a little liquor from cooked spinach or 
simmer one or two spinach leaves in 
the tomato juice. The spinach is es- 
pecially important as aiding the flavor, 
but it is absolutely essential for good 
results that it be limited to a quantity 
too small for the specific taste to be 
recognizable. At the last, add the 
usual selection of vegetables to fulfil its 
title of printanier. I find that most 
people prefer the well-cooked printanier 
added at the close, thus permitting 
each vegetable to retain its appropriate 
flavor, rather than a printanier cooked 
in the soup. In the latter case the 
flavor of the garnish assumes a weak 
imitation of the broth, and one of its 
main purposes — namely, variety to the 
taste as the dish is eaten — is lost. This 
soup has been pleasing to my guests, 
proving palatable and well spiced, 
when its appearance did not lead them 



to expect a highly seasoned food. 
This little element of surprise undoubt- 
edly aids its success. It should be 
added that, while the tomato juice 
should be strong enough to give a good 
flavor, it should not be opaque to the 
extent of obscuring the printanier, and 
thus marring the appearance of the 
soup. Also, it should be noted that 
there is not a predominating flavor of 
tomato, but one well tempered with 
herbs and spices, each individually dis- 
guised, but all contributing to the final 
result. 

So much for a variation. Now for 
something different in its nature, and 
more strictly original in its concep- 
tion. This, for lack of a better name, 
we will call 

Boston Roast 

First, take the juice of one lemon, 
add fifteen drops of cider vinegar, and 
season to taste with salt and paprika. 
These proportions hold, of course, for 
larger quantities. For each pound of 
honeycomb tripe which you may 
choose to cook, allow sixteen very large 
or two dozen small oysters. Assum- 
ing that you have bought your tripe 
properly cleaned, and have duly sim- 
mered it for three hours, until it is 
ready to melt in your mouth, you 
will proceed to roll it in beaten egg and 
then in fine bread or cracker crumbs. 
Next heat a covered serving-dish, and 
on the back of the range set a Wash- 
ington pie tin or other very thin metal 
dish, that it also may get thoroughly 
hot. Take a short rest, catch a deep 
breath, and prepare to hustle. These 
last directions may appear frivolous, 
but they are not. 

Broil your prepared tripe over the 
hot coals, spread rather thickly with 



346 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



butter, and transfer to the heated 
serving-dish, to keep hot. Draw your 
metal dish to the front of the stove at 
once, dry and ungreased. Turn in the 
oysters and pan-broil them in thirty 
seconds, turning each once in the pan. 
Don't overcook the oysters. This is one 
of the few methods that, if properly 
performed, will leave an oyster tender. 
Spread the oysters on the tripe, turn 
the acid sauce over both, and serve in- 
stantly while all is piping hot. 

Some prefer to place thin dried toast 
under the tripe, thus making a three- 
story roast, as it were. In this case, 
cook the toast prior to the tripe, and, 
as it should be lightly buttered while 
hot, do not butter the tripe also, but 
add melted butter to the other ingredi- 
ents of the sauce, when that is com- 
pounded. 

As far as I know, this dish is an en- 
tirely new combination of tripe and 
oysters, and it is very palatable. If 
compelled to use pickled tripe, which 
combines less well with fresh oysters, 
and should be relied on only under the 
pressure of necessity, omit the vinegar 
in the sauce and also lessen the lemon 
juice, if advisable. 

Sausages a la Portland 

These are just plain American sau- 
sages, the Portland part all coming in 
the cooking and the title. But, then, 
don't let that scare one too quickly 
Perhaps you may have in your family 
one of those poor souls who suffer 
purgatory on this earth, — walking up 
and down in it with an extreme and 
everlasting liking for sausage meat, 
and suffering the torments of some- 
thing worse than purgatory, if they in- 
dulge their craving. Take notice, these 
sausages are as digestible as it is possi- 
ble to make such a combination, as 
several dyspeptics know to their joy. 

Prick the casings several times with 
a needle or fine fork, to prevent burst- 
ing. Place in an enamel or other suit- 



able dish, cover with boiling water, and 
set on the back of the stove, to keep 
the water at a temperature of i6o° to 
170 F., to which point it will naturally 
fall in warming the meat. If you use 
the little fancy sausages so common 
in the city, that measure about one- 
half inch in diameter, cook them at 
the given temperature from forty-five 
to sixty minutes, or even longer. The 
common country sausage, one inch in 
diameter, should be cooked upwards 
of one and one-half hours. Don't boil 
them, don't overheat them. On re- 
moving from the water, dry at once 
on the surface with a dean cloth, and 
broil immediately over the coals. This 
latter cooking should be just long 
enough to brown slightly the exterior, 
and give a little "taste of the fire" as 
a finishing touch. It will be perceived 
that the real cooking comes in the long 
water bath, and at a temperature that 
will leave the sausages thoroughly 
tender. There is but little loss of fat 
to the water; but, if you forget to 
prick them at first, they will almost 
surely explode on the broiler. 

These should be served hot, as soon 
as taken from the coals, either plain 
or upon thin slices of lightly buttered 
dry toast. If desired, a tomato sauce 
may be poured over, in either case, or, 
with a pepper added to this last, we 
have Portland sausages k la Creole. 
Again, as with the oysters, some people 
prefer a lemon, salt, and pepper dress- 
ing. Place a few broiled oysters with 
them on the toast, by no means a bad 
combination, use the last-mentioned 
dressing, and call it a Portland fancy 
roast. 

As a sauce for certain forms of cooked 
meats, that given below will be found 
satisfactory; and our vegetarian friends 
may use it with stewed or broiled pro- 
tose, or for macaroni and other forms 
of pasta, with most gratifying results 
to the palate. The proportions are 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of Kitchen

Bouquet, one-fourth a cup of tomato 
catsup, one and one-half cups of water, 
two rounded teaspoonfuls of cornstarch, 
or, preferably, ground arrowroot, four 
ripe California olives, sliced, two small 
pickled onions, sliced, a touch of lime 
juice, or even of pickled-lime juice, 
trace of cinnamon, ditto of paprika, 
cayenne, or any other pepper that you 
like, one-fourth a bay leaf, and one 
teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. 

Stew, at 2 1 2° F. or over, for two hours. 
I say "or over," as thick compounds 
usually boil at somewhat higher tem- 
peratures than water. This should re- 
duce in that time to one cup of thick 
sauce. Anyway, it may be kept up 
to that amount by judicious additions 
of boiling water. Later, after trial, 
you will increase the quantity — of 
sauce, not of water. 

Welsh Croquettes 

First make some rice croquettes in 
the old manner that you wearied of 
so many years ago. Boil your rice in 
the same old way, with water or milk 
as fancy dictates, add your egg and 
a little seasoning, if desired. Mould 
your mixture, roll it in egg and crumbs, 
set it away as usual in the ice-box, and 
relieve your mind with the query, "Now 
what does the man propose to do with 
those old things ?" N.B— I will get 
even with you when it comes to the 
cooking of them. 

When you are ready to prepare them 
for the table, make a mixture in the 
proportion of one beaten egg to each 
ounce of grated cheese, with your 
favorite rarebit seasoning. Plunge 
your croquettes in a deep bath of smok- 
ing-hot olive oil or cheaper fat, and 
start your semi-rarebit, semi-scrambled 
egg over a hot-water bath. If rightly 
done, you will get your croquettes 
cooked to a turn, and on a hot dish at 
your elbow, just a small fraction of a 
second before that absorbing moment 



when the rarebit demands your un- 
divided attention. Turn your rarebit 
over your croquettes, and serve at 
once. I allow the single egg and ounce 
of cheese to three croquettes. You 
can have the proportion of dressing 
larger, when it will become rarebit 
with variations, instead of croquettes 
with variations. 

If your taste runs to more cheese, 
lessen the egg and make it a straight 
rarebit. If it tends to simpler lines, 
put plain scrambled eggs on the cro- 
quettes, and call them good. Also 
call them eggs chinois 'or any other 
thing you please. 

Eggs on Brown Bread 

And, speaking of eggs, just try for 
once serving your poached or scrambled 
eggs on thin slices of brown-bread toast, 
the old-fashioned kind that your grand- 
mother served with beans, not whole- 
wheat or Graham bread, and you will 
do it frequently thereafter. This last 
is not original. Quite to the contrary. 
'Tis stolen bodily from a cheap restau- 
rant, without apology. 

Fruit Salad Dressing 

To make a scant cup, take the juice 
of one lemon, one gill of water, one-half 
a gill of Angelica wine, three drops, 
exactly, of Jamaica ginger, no more, 
and eight heaping teaspoonfuls of 
sugar. Pour this over the fruit, and 
let the whole stand in a cold place for 
two hours or more. If the taste of the 
liquor is wished more pronounced, use 
one gill of the Angelica and five drops 
of the Jamaica ginger, without increas- 
ing the proportion of the other ingre- 
dients. The ginger is added for flavor- 
ing, not with any idea of medicinal 
value. Hence do not exceed the 
quantities given. This dressing goes 
excellently with a mixture of peaches, 
bananas, oranges, and pineapple, all 
properly cut or sliced. 



Food and Cookery in Jamaica 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



IT has been remarked that the 
islands adjacent to the United 
States, like Porto Rico and 
Jamaica, which produce tropical fruits 
and vegetables in abundance, export 
to the United States vegetables and 
bananas, and in return import vast 
quantities of salt fish, corn-meal, and 
other commonplace articles of diet. 

In Porto Rico, bananas replace bread, 
which can only be had in the towns. 
The native Jamaican eats green or 
partly ripened bananas or larger plan- 
tains, when boiled or roasted and 
dressed with butter, as an accompani- 
ment to salt fish. To the majority of 
the world raw bananas are infinitely 
preferable to cooked bananas; but, as 
a bread substitute, either would soon 
become insufferable, and only a New 
England training suffices to make some 
. persons tolerate salt fish. It is a mat- 
ter of surprise, therefore, when the 
island is supplied with varieties of 
fresh fish from both the ocean and the 
mountain streams, also with lobsters, 
shrimps, and crabs, how very fond the 
Jamaicans are of salt fish. It is pop- 
ular with the natives, and often eaten 
by the more favored classes. It is pre- 
pared in a variety of ways, for instance : 
curried and served with rice balls; 
made into a sort of scrapple with corn- 
meal; baked with yams, avoiding, of 
course, the very sweet varieties, and 
adding plenty of butter and chopped 
parsley; scalded and then fried with 
onions and tomatoes; baked with eggs, 
herbs, butter, and tomatoes; and with 
tomatoes, eggs, skellions, allspice, and 
parsley made into fritters. Boiled with 
rice and a piece of salt pork is a favor- 
ite method of serving it, and any left 
is, with the addition of eggs, converted 
into fritters, while still a third fritter 



is made by mixing the fish with "ac- 
kees." Ackees are a brilliant scarlet 
fruit with black seeds. The fat-like 
white substance next the seed is the 
part used. Ackees we do not have 
here, but the other recipes for salt fish 
from a Jamaica cookery book would 
give points even to Cape Cod house- 
keepers. 

This book, which is a standard on 
the island, often refers to products by 
the local name only, which is most 
puzzling. Of course one can compre- 
hend what "jelly cocoanuts" must be, 
and long to have fresh "guavas" to 
use, since most of us have been familiar 
with the jelly all our lives; and, per- 
haps, in sickness we have been given 
"tamarind"' water to quench feverish 
thirst. But we must turn past refer- 
ences to "goon goos" and "Otaheite 
apples" and "Cape gooseberries," while 
"anseberries," said to be like "sapa- 
dillas," and "guineps," "cashews," and 
"cherrymoyers" dance a jig in our 
heads. "Jamblangs" and "jimblings" 
and "bimblings" are names that sug- 
gest a flora as eccentric as the fauna 
of Lewis Carroll with a Jabberwock 
and a Snark. 

Familiarity with names current in 
the Southern States makes it plain 
that "pindars" are none other than 
peanuts, or "goobers," as they are also 
called. In the tropical parts of Florida 
many of the fruits from Jamaica and 
Cuba and warm countries the other 
side of the globe have been introduced 
and grown successfully, but as yet 
they are little known in Northern 
markets. The mango, believed by gov- 
ernment experts to be the coming fruit, 
and rose apple and Jamaica sorrel are 
some of these. 

Avoiding all those which are unin- 



Food and Cookery in Jamaica 



349 



telligible, there yet remain in this little 
treatise many hints and methods of 
procedure we can follow, or at least, are 
suggestive and interesting. 

For instance, we are just learning 
to add cocoanut milk to tomato soup; 
but who has ever tried bean and cocoa- 
nut soup? Curried pumpkin is a new 
soup. The Jamaica dumplings made 
of half-wheat flour and half -corn-meal, 
which are served with a thick pea soup, 
would make a hearty dish. Pumpkin 
is cooked with rice, tomato, onions, 
and the inevitable bit of salt pork. 

For a breakfast dish "Ricey-Coco" 
is a favorite. To some rice boiled very 
soft are added cocoanut cream, nutmeg, 
cinnamon, and sugar, with rose water 
to taste. The cocoanut cream is made 
by putting hot water on the grated 
cocoanut and squeezing out the milky 
juice through a cloth. After it has 
been set aside, the cream will rise upon 
the top, like dairy cream. If this is not 
a pleasing breakfast dish, try a porridge 
of breadfruit and green banana flour. 

The breakfast bills of fare seem more 
like luncheons, since the "early coffee'' 
is carried to the bedside with toast, 
a roll, and fresh fruit, some time be- 
fore the regular breakfast is served. 
Imagine a table with a centre-piece of 
pineapples in perfection of ripeness, 
with grape-fruit, figs, oranges, bananas, 
star apples, mangoes, and many other 
fruits, and lemonade, "cocoanut water," 
and "pine drink" for beverages. For 
the substantiate you would find ome- 
lettes of oysters or fish, cutlets of kid 
mutton with mushroom sauce and a 
dash of lime juice in it, mashed yam, or 
roasted plantain. 

At luncheon some of the following 
dishes would be served you in Jamaica : 
rice cooked with pumpkin, pig's tongue 
stewed with red peas, fish cutlets, fried 
plantains, and for a dessert pineapple 
jam with cocoanut cream or angel cake 
with guava dolce. Perhaps you would 
like salt fish patties, fried plaintain, 



timbales of kid mutton, or cold kid 
mutton pie, baked yams, sugar beans, 
and mango chutney, followed by cocoa- 
nut blanc-mange. 

A typical dinner would be cocoanut 
soup, entree of stuffed tomato, leg of 
kid mutton boiled with white sauce 
and onions, roasted guinea hirds, white 
yams roasted, Indian kale, spinach, 
boiled ackees, then guava pudding, 
black crabs, banana ice-cream, fruit. 
The serving of shell-fish at the end of 
a dinner and next to banana ice-cream 
is sufficient to cause one to wonder at 
the digestion of diners-out in Jamaica. 
Another dinner, quite similar in ar- 
rangement, is pumpkin soup, entire 
of eggs on Indian kale, or of lobsters 
or oyster patties, then roast meat, 
boiled fowl, yams masked and shaped, 
stuffed "garden eggs," a mock apple 
pudding made of cho-cho and limes, 
wild cucumbers on toast, birds, sour- 
sop ice-cream, and fruit. According 
to American ideas of plenty one would 
not starve at such a dinner table. 
And at least one could find dishes 
suited to every palate and digestion. 

Avocado pears — pronounced agua- 
cado, and also called alligator pears — 
are now becoming known in our cities. 
They are used in Jamaica chiefly for 
breakfast and luncheon, and are eaten 
with pepper and salt. For dessert they 
are prepared by mashing the pulp after 
removing the hard skin and the seed. 
To this pulp add sugar, nutmeg, and 
sherry, and mix all well together. 

Blackberries and strawberries* are 
brought to the coast towns from the 
mountain regions, and from there the 
supply of kid mutton, so freely used, 
is also brought. Beef and sheep mut- 
ton and poultry are to be had; but, as 
they are cooked in the usual way, the 
compiler of the Jamaica cookery book 
has preferred to give more space to the 
best ways of making the truly Jamaican 
dishes of the most used foods. Kid

Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 

By Mary D. Chambers 
Lesson IV. Oysters 



m 

EACH student — or, owing to limi- 
tations of the appropriation, 
each group of two students — is 
given six small oysters. One is im- 
mersed in vinegar and allowed to stand 
until the close of the lesson, four are 
subjected to two or more of the various 
cooking processes, one is saved for com- 
parison. Effect of different methods is 
then compared as regards flavor, size, 
and texture of the oysters. 

Study of Oysters in Cooking 

i. In Shell. — Wash and scrub shells. 
Place in pan with round side down. 
Bake in hot oven until shells open. 
Remove upper shell, season, and serve. 

Note. — Oysters can be cooked in the shell 
on the top of a hot stove, on a gridiron over 
the coals, or in a steamer. 

2 Panned. — Place oysters on small, 
oblong pieces of toast in dripping-pan, 
and bake until plump. Serve with 
l$mon butter. 

Lemon Butter. — Cream butter, and 
add by degrees one-third as much 
lemon juice. Place on ice until hard. 

3. Oysters and Bacon Sautid. — Cut 
bacon in dice, and cook in hot pan 
until* crisp. Add oysters, carefully 
dried, and cook until done. Drain off 
fat, and serve oysters and bacon on 
toast moistened with oyster liquor. 

4. "Huitres au Lit," or "Pigs in 
Blankets." — Wrap each oyster, first 
well dried, in a thin slice of bacon, and 
fasten with a wooden toothpick. Cook 
on hot pan until bacon is crisp. Serve 
on toast, moistened as before. 

5. Fried Oysters. — Roll oysters first 
in crumbs, then in beaten egg (see Les- 



son III.), then in crumbs again, and 
fry in deep fat one to two minutes. 

6. Oyster Stew. — Ingredients: Oys- 
ters and liquor, milk, butter, salt, and 
pepper. 

Method : Cook oysters first in liquor. 
Then add milk, about in equal quan- 
tity. Then butter, one to two table- 
spoonfuls to a pint of the mixture, 
seasoning to taste. 

7. Oyster Soup. — Same ingredients as 
stew, with the addition of thickening, 
— one tablespoonful of flour to one cup 
of oysters and liquor. Proceed as for 
white sauce, adding oyster liquor first 
to the blended flour and butter, then 
adding oysters, then milk. Herbs and 
onions can be used if desired. 

8. Creamed Oysters. — Same ingredi- 
ents and method as for soup, twice as 
much thickening. Celery salt, if de- 
sired. 

9. Escaloped Oysters. — Creamed oys- 
ters in baking-dish, covered with but- 
tered crumbs and browned in oven. 

10. Oysters d la Poulette. — Creamed 
oysters with beaten egg added, one 
egg or two yolks to each cup of the 
mixture. Nutmeg, if desired. When 
add egg? 

1 1 . Oysters in Sauce Supreme. — Same 
as k la poulette, with the addition of 
lemon juice, one tablespoonful to a cup 
of the mixture. When add lemon juice ? 
Why? 

Corroborative Experiments 

1. Take two large, plump, "floated" 
oysters. Cook one in distilled water, 
the other in a strong salt solution, 
until gills separate and become "frilled." 

2. Take two oysters and use any pre- 



Lessons in Cookery and .Food Economy 



35 1 



ferred medium for cooking. Cook one 
until gills separate and "frill." Cook 
the second five minutes longer. 

3. Take four freshly opened oysters. 
Bruise the soft part of one, and set. 
away in a moderately warm place for 
one-half to one hour. Cook the second, 
then bruise the soft part, and proceed 
as before. Place the third, without 
bruising, in a moderately warm place 
with the other two. Do not allow 
them to touch one another. Set the 
third on ice. At the end of the time 
allowed taste of all four.

Questions 

Compare the effect of water, heat, 
and acid on eggs, fish, and oysters. 
Illustrate from cooking processes. 



Compare raw and cooked oysters as 
to flavor, digestibility, wholesomeness. 

What is the economic value of floated 
oysters compared with that of un- 
floated ? 

When may salt be used in a recipe 
for cooking oysters? When may it be 
omitted ? 

Compare, as to nutritive value, ten 
cents' worth each of the following 
foods: oysters, milk, round steak, 
eggs* (Consult tables of composition.) 

What form of carbo-hydrate should 
you expect to find in oysters? 

Account for the expression, "An 
oyster digests itself." What is the 
least digestible portion of the oyster? 

What three parts in the anatomy of 
the oyster does it chiefly concern us to 
identify for purposes of cooking? 

Compare the value of clear soup be- 
fore dinner with that of oysters. 

Note. — Should the students find it difficult 
to make a correct inference from Experiment 
1, or should the practical work with oysters 
have thrown no light on the matter, the fol- 
lowing experiment may be performed, if the 
means are available: — 

Half fill a gold-beater's bag with a 
strong salt solution, and suspend in a 
vessel of pure water for one to two 
hours. Measure volume of water in 
bag before and after experiment. 

Test water in vessel, also solution in 
bag, for chlorides before and after ex- 
periment. 



Rest 

By Eugene C. Dolson 



So much unfinished! Lo, the sun 
Sinks down the sky; but rest is sweet. 

And what is left to-night undone 
Some time we may complete. 



Could we, for once, but think to turn 
Prom the hard service of our days! 

How long it takes us to unlearn 
Life's wonted treadmill ways!

WOMAN'S INFLUENCE IN COL- 
LEGE EDUCATION 

ANNOUNCEMENT of the ap- 
/\ pointment of Miss Mary Abbott, 
X JL °f Watertown, Ct., as chairman 
of the Educational Committee of the 
General Federation of Women's Clubs, 
has been made by Mrs. Sarah Piatt 
Decker, president of the Federation. 
The appointment is one of the most 
important yet made by Mrs. Decker. 
Other members of the committee will 
be deans and presidents of prominent 
colleges. 

"The work of this committee," said 
Mrs. Decker, "will be one of the fore- 
most considerations of the Federation. 



We will try to formulate plans for 
work with college women, with a view 
to eventually introducing domestic sci- 
ence, manual training, and the like in 
our colleges. The idea is to fit the 
boys and girls more than is now done 
for the work in the world, — not to edu- 
cate them so much alike, but to give 
them training in the things for which 
one is specially adapted." 



HEALTHFUL LIVING 

LIVING to eat is one thing: eat- 
ing to live is quite another. 
^The one is low and sordid : the 
other is wise and prudent. 

But is not the saying true, that "the 
woman who would economize first 
draws her purse-strings in the market 
and at the restaurant ? With her milli- 
ner's bill she may find no fault, but in 
butcher's book and grocer's every 
half -penny is to be disputed." This 
is not the spirit of true economy, as 
it is not indicative of healthful living. 
Right living, and that is healthful 
living, has been called an art. And, 
again, it is said, "In the planning of 
the perfect meal there is art." After 
all, is not art the one real, the impor- 
tant thing in life? Surely, art in all 
things is an inspiring motive. 

Another and pertinent reason for cul- 
tivating healthful living should appeal 
especially to women. According to 
Brillat-Savarin, "It has been proved 
by a series of rigorously exact obser- 
vations that by a succulent, delicate, 
and choice regimen the external ap- 
pearances of age are kept away for a 
long time. It gives more brilliancy to 
the eye, more freshness to the skin, 
more support to the muscles. And as 
it is certain in physiology that wrinkles, 
those formidable enemies of beauty, 
are caused by the depression of muscles, 
it is equally true that, other things 
being equal, those who understand 
eating are comparatively four years 



Editorials 



353 



younger than those who are ignorant 
of that science." And thus, too, it 
may be added, is life prolonged. 

In a wider sense we must include in 
the means to right living the character 
of the books we read, the company we 
keep, and the ideals we cherish. Plain 
living and high thinking will do as 
a warning note to the over-indulgent. 
But the fact remains indisputable that 
they who would make the most of life 
must give primary and due regard to 
the economic functions of wholesome 
food, pure air, and physical exercise. 
' * Of the primal forces of all living, nu- 
trition easily ranks first, and affects 
the others most profoundly." 



€€ 




WORK 

IFE, to be rightly lived, re- 
quires a personal aim, a reso- 

lute purpose, incentive to ex- 
ertion, to self-culture, to self-sacrifice. 
Only in this way lies health of body 
and mind." 

"Pleasure in work lessens expense of 
living more than any other single thing. 
Exercise properly taken means a keener 
appetite, and permits less expensive 
food. A simpler life is possible when 
mere living is a pleasure." 

Nowhere are these truths less heeded 
than among housekeepers. We fail to 
realize that joy in work takes the mind 
off the drudgery of life, and gives zest 
to every form of activity. Undoubt- 
edly, a certain degree of prosperity is 
essential to human happiness. We 
know, when times are good, people are 
happy and contented. They worry less, 
and sleep more peacefully. But it is 
a somewhat mistaken idea that the 
chief incentive to work is the possession 
of money or things. To toil merely for 
sustenance is lowest drudgery. In the 
actual doing and achieving lies the 
surest pleasure. The consciousness of 
work well done affords the highest 
measure of satisfaction. Children de- 



light in constant action. Judicious 
commendation of their feeble attempts 
to do or make things is only incentive 
to greater and renewed efforts. The 
more one does, the more he is capable 
of doing. Confidence in self begets 
confidence in others. 

Ability to do, then, capacity for 
work, is the criterion by which men are 
tested : it is the measure of one's worth. 
"Civilization," says Mrs. Richards in 
"The Art of Right Living," "may 
be designated as a condition of wants. 
When we civilize a savage nation, we 
teach the people to want things they 
never had or cared to have. It is not the 
things that are good for them, too often 
the reverse; but it is the incentive to 
work, in order to have more, that 
arouses ambition, stirs dormant facul- 
ties, and makes a man or a nation out 
of a horde of inefficient people. Health 
is wealth only when the will to do is 
also present." 

ON CULINARY TERMS 

MANY people seem to object to 
the use of foreign or French 
terms in cookery. The English 
language is thought to be good enough 
to express thought on all subjects and all 
occasions, which in the main is true in- 
deed ; and yet there are reasons that jus- 
tify the use of foreign words and phrases 
in certain cases, to say nothing of the re- 
quirements of usage and custom. The 
English language is and ever has been 
a borrower. It has absorbed matter 
from all the languages of earth, and is 
still in the business. The nomenclature 
of science and -ology is in foreign terms; 
and so scientific names and formula 
become universal and common to all 
nations. Latin was once the language 
of scholars everywhere, as French be- 
came later the language of diplomacy. 
To the art of cookery the people of 
all nations have made contributions, 
but the French have elaborated and 
brought the art to the highest degree 



354 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



of perfection. To-day we go to French 
chefs for dishes and to French writers 
as the original source of culinary lore; 
for these have cultivated the prepara- 
tion and serving of food as an art. 
In most cook-books the names of 
dishes and recipes are given in both 
English and French. In England and 
on the Continent a menu is rarely 
written in English. French holds its 
place as the polite language of the cui- 
sine. Often it requires many words in 
English to express the meaning of a 
single French word. 

" I have long been forced to the con- 
clusion," wrote Sit Henry Thomson, 
"that menus, as a rule, should be writ- 
ten altogether in the French language. 
So many French culinary terms have 
been naturalized; so many more are 
almost if not quite untranslatable, 
that the endeavor to write menus in 
English invariably results in an object- 
ionable mixture of the two languages, 
resembling a mongrel patois." 

Thus it would seem that the Amer- 
ican housewife, or cook, might well 
aspire to the knowledge of a few French 
words and phrases; that is, such a 
smattering as will suffice her to grasp 
the meaning of a menu or name of a 
dish, even though it be written in a 
foreign tongue. The ordinary English 
dictionary holds the key to most of 
the terms in common use. 

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

ONE of the must useful and 
convenient of appliances in the 
household is an apparatus for 
weighing. One never knows its full 
value until it has been tried, and then 
it is found to be simply indispensable. 
Weights are ever exact: measures are 
constantly and hopelessly variable. 
Guessing anywhere is neither safe nor 
economical. In many cases the only 
way not to cheat or be cheated, not to 



err or waste, in the preparation of 
dishes, is to determine quantities by 
actual weight. 

To many the price of scales has been 
&n obstacle to possession. At last, we 
are able to offer a very good $et of 
scales for the household on terms that 
place them within the reach of all our 
readers. These scales are represented 
on another page. They are always 
ready for immediate use, and weigh 
accurately, by ounces, up to twenty- 
four pounds. 

Those who avail themselves of this 
opportunity to have ever at hand the 
means of weighing will never regret 
the small outlay required. Their use- 
fulness, it will be found, will not be 
confined to the kitchen alone. 



Attorney-general Moody, in opening 
the case against the Beef Trust before 
the Supreme Court in Washington, 
after pointing out that it was not a 
question of monopoly in the abstract, 
but monopoly in the concrete which 
the court was asked to deal with, said: 
"But has a responsible voice yet been 
heard to justify, legally or economically, 
a conspiracy or agreement between 
nearly all the producers of a commodity 
necessary to life, by which the confed- 
erates acquire absolute control and 
dominion over production, sale, and 
distribution of that commodity through- 
out the entire territory of a nation, with 
the power at will to raise prices to the 
consumer of the finished product and 
lower prices to the producer of the raw 
material? That there is a conspiracy 
to control the market of the nation for 
fresh meats, that it does control it, and 
its control is merciless and oppressive, 
are facts known of all men. 1 ' Such 
official utterances must affect legisla- 
tion and judicial decrees sooner or 
later. The day of the "square deal" 
draws nearer. — Congregationalist. 



Grape-fruit Marmalade 



Seasonable Recipes 

By Janet M. Hill 

IN all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise staled, the flour is measured after sifting o: 
When floor is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant, 
tablespoon ful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such material. 



Grape-fruit Marmalade 
Take three large grape-fruit, six 
oranges, and three lemons. Remove a 
thick slice from both ends of the grape- 
fruit. Cut each fruit into quarters, 
and slice these very thin, discarding 
seeds and all the white core. Prepare 
the oranges and lemons in the same 
way. Cover with four quarts of cold 
water, and let stand in a cool place over 
night. The next morning boil until 
the peel looks transparent, about two 
hours, in an uncovered kettle. Then 
add ten pounds and a half of granu- 
lated sugar, and cook until the mixture 
is thick enough to hold up the bits of 
peel. Store in jars. Cover, when cold, 
with paper wet in brandy, and then 
with a second covering of waxed paper. 
With a meat-board, upon which to 
rest the fruit, and a thin, sharp knife, 
the slicing can be done most expedi- 
particu- 



tiouslv. This marmalade 



larly good. It is only mildly bitter. 
Possibly the proportion of grape-fruit 
might be increased without making the 
bitter flavor too pronounced. 

Apple Marmalade 
Pare, quarter, and core enough apples 
to make eight pounds. Wash and 
drain these. Pour on about half as 
much boiling water, cover, and cook 
until tender. In the mean time have 
ready four or five lemons, sliced very 
thin; remove the seeds, and let cook 
in three pints of water until very ten- 
der. Press the apples through a puree 
sieve or a gravy strainer, using a wooden 
pestle. Add the lemons and seven 
pounds of sugar. Stir and cook until 
thick, then store as jelly. The mar- 
malade is cooked enough when, being 
tested on a cold saucer, no separation 
into liquid and p"lp takes place. Often 
the juice of the lemons only is used.

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



Sometimes the expressed juice is added 
with the yellow rind in halves, the 
latter being removed before the jelly 
is stored. Three-fourths a pound of 



Grape-fruit with Macedoine of Fruits 

sugar to each pound of apple is the 
proportion. Without scales, use three- 
fourths a cup of sugar to each cup of 
apple pulp. 

Grape-fruit with Macedoine of 
Fruits 

(First course at Luncheon or Dinner) 
(Half a grape-fruit, one service) 
Cut the grape-fruit in halves cross- 
wise. With a thin, sharp-pointed 



orange spoon or fork. Also cut the 
membrane separating the sections and 
the core from the skin, and so remove 
the membrane and core in one piece. 
For each half of grape- 
fruit have ready about 
a tablespoon ful of pre- 
pared fruit. A mixt- 
ure of pineapple, fresh 
or canned, orange, and 
maraschino cherries 
is good. Brandied 
peaches may be used, 
when at hand, as also 
fresh white grapes, 
seeded and skinned. 
Mix the fruit, cut in 
small pieces, with 
liquid from the cherry bottle, sugar, or 
sugar syrup, and use to fill the open place 
in the centre. Decorate with maraschino 
cherries, cut in quarters. For a change 
omit the macedoine, and, just at serving. 
put a tablespoonful of sifted powdered 
sugar in the centre of each half -fruit, and 
decorate with pieces of cherry, as before.

With a pestle press the whole through 
a puree sieve, and set over the fire to 
reheat. Melt one-fourth a cup of but- 
ter. In it cook one-fourth a cup of 
flour, a teaspoonful of 
salt, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper. 
Add two cups of milk, 
and stir until the boil- 
ing-point is reached. 
Let simmer five or 
six minutes. Then 
add the celery pulp, 
of which there should 
be one pint. This 
soup will not be too thin, and may 
be diluted at pleasure with hot milk, 
stock, or cream. A tablespoonful of 
tiny croutons may be sprinkled over 
each plate of soup at serving, or larger 
croutons may be passed, to be eaten 
from the hand. 

Croutons 
Cut stale bread in slices one-third an 
inch thick. Remove the crusts, and 
spread lightly with butter. Cut the 
slices in one-third an inch cubes or 
strips or in pieces an inch square. Let 
stand in the oven until delicately 
browned. Boston or common crackers, 
split and buttered, then 
browned in the oven, 
are also served with 
cream soups. 

Oysters, Manhattan 

Style 

(To strait from four to eight) 

(Entree at Dinner or fish 

course at Luncheon or 

Supper) 
Take from three to 
six oysters for each in- 
dividual service. Have 
them freshly opened, and on the deep 
part of the shell. For two dozen oysters 
cream half a cup of butter. Work into 
this half a teaspoonful of paprika, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, and a tablespoon- 



ful of fine-chopped parsley. Divide 
this mixture among the oyster shells, 
putting a bit on each oyster, then cover 
the oyster completely with a piece of 



Oysters, Manhattan Style 

bacon, cut thin as a wafer, and freed 
from rind. Set the shells on a baking- 
tin into a hot oven, and let cook about 
twelve minutes, or until the bacon is 
crisp. Serve at once on a folded nap- 
kin with a quarter of lemon. 

Boiled Ham Moulded in Aspic 
Jelly 

(To serve ten) 
(Buffet Luncheon or Supper) 
Scrub the round half of a ham (not 
the shank half), cover with cold water, 
and let heat slowly to the boiling-point, 
then simmer until the ham is tender 
(five or six hours). When cold, cut in

Let a few spoonfuls of the aspic be- 
come "set" in a charlotte mould hold- 
ing a quart. Upon this dispose deco- 
rations cut from the cooked white of 
an egg, truffles, and capers, and cover 
with more aspic. Thin slices of cooked 
beet or carrot are also suitable for dec- 
orating the mould. Dip other decora- 
tions in aspic, and set them against 



Canned Corn Pudding. See page 36: 

the chilled sides of the mould. Fill 
the mould, alternately, with slices of 
ham and liquid aspic. When un- 
moulded, garnish the dish with triangles 



of aspic, figures cut from truffles or 
cooked beets, shredded lettuce, and 
large red chillies. 

Potato Tim bales 
en Surprise 

(To lerwtfour la tigti) 
(Breakfast or Luncheon) 
Mash enough boiled 
potatoes to make a 
pint. Season with half 
a teaspoonful or more 
of salt, a dash of pep- 
per, two or three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, 
and milk as needed. 
Beat thoroughly, then 
beat in one egg, beaten 
without separating the white and yolk. 
The mixture should be firm enough 
to hold in shape. Have ready eight 
or ten timbale moulds with papers 
fitted in the bottom. Brush the in- 
side of the moulds very thoroughly 
with butter, then sprinkle with sifted 
bread crumbs. Fill the moulds with 
the potato, then with a spoon or 
knife take out the 
centre of each, leav- 
ing a narrow wall. 
Have ready three- 
fourths a cup of 
fine-chopped, boiled 
ham, mixed with 
half a cup of cream 
sauce. Use this to 
fill the open spaces 
in the moulds. Cover 
with more potato, 
and set into the oven 
on a baking sheet. 
Let set in the oven 
nearly ten minutes. 
Then, after cooling 
about two minutes, 
turn onto a serving- 
dish. Serve with tomato sauce or 
with the ham mixture not used, 
stirred into a cup of thin white 
sauce.

spoonful of cream of tartar to the 
thread or soft-ball stage (236 ). Add 
the softened gelatine, two ounces of 
tartaric acid, or the juice of one lemon,

mixture begins to thicken, then turn 
it from a pitcher or through a glass 
funnel into depressions made in a box

of capers, eight or ten dressed ancho- 
vies, cut in bits, and a truffle, chopped 
fine. Mix again, and set aside in a

and surrounded by boiling water, until 
the centre is firm. Serve hot as a 
vegetable with the meat course, or 
with bread and butter at luncheon or 
supper. One or two tablespoonfuls of 
chopped green or red pepper is an ad- 
dition to the dish well worth trying. 
For a company dinner, beat the white 
of an egg, with a few grains of salt, 
until firm, pipe this in nests upon the 
top of the baked pudding, and return 
the dish to the oven to set the egg*. 
Finish with a cube of jelly in the centre 
of each nest. See page 358. 

Stuffed Eggs in Aspic 

(Salad for Luncheon, Supper, or Evening 
Company) 

Allow one egg for two moulds. Cover 
the eggs with boiling water, heat again 
to the boiling-point, and let stand 
where the eggs will keep hot without 
boiling half an hour, then drain, and 
cover with cold water. Let stand in 
the water until cold, then remove the 
shells. Cut the white from both ends, 
leaving a ring of white in the middle. 
Cut this in halves, and remove the 
yolk. Press the yolks through a sieve. 
Add an equal bulk of anchovies (those 
put up in oil preferred), pounded 
smooth, also lemon juice, capers, pa- 
prika, a suspicion of onion juice, and 
salt, if needed. Mix these ingredients 
thoroughly, then shape into balls equal 
in size to the yolk of an egg m Set these 
into the rings of egg-white, and lay 
them in the moulds on a thin layer of 
aspic jelly, made consistent in ice and 
water. Pour liquid aspic around this 
centre, and let become firm. Serve on 
lettuce leaves, dressed with French 
dressing, and mayonnaise, also, if de- 
sired. The moulds are more showy if 
decorated with white of egg and 
truffles. See page 359. 

Salad of Peas and Truffles in Aspic 

Fill timbale moulds with aspic jelly 
in a liquid state. When set and firm, 



dip a thin-pointed knife-blade into 
boiling water and cut out the centre 
from each mould, leaving a wall of 
jelly a generous quarter of an inch 
thick. The dish will be prettier, if 
the moulds be decorated, before filling, 
with figures cut from thin slices of 
truffle and white of egg. Chop a few 
truffle trimmings fine, and mix them 
with half a cup or more of cooked peas. 
Mix these with French dressing, using 
enough to thoroughly coat each pea. 
Use the dressed peas and truffles to 
fill the open spaces in the moulds. 
Have ready the jelly, taken out of 
the moulds, melted and half cooled 
by standing in ice water. Use this 
to fill the moulds above the peas. 
Serve, thoroughly chilled, on a dish 
with lettuce leaves, dressed with oil, 
vinegar, and condiments. See page 

359. 

Braised Chicken 

Dress, clean, and truss a four-pound 
fowl. Have ready two slices of fat salt 
pork one-fourth an inch thick. Cut 
these in strips and cook slowly, to re- 
move the fat. Take out the scraps, 
and add to the hot fat half a carrot 
cut in slices, half an onion cut in small 
pieces, a sprig of parsley and a bay 
leaf, and cook five minutes. Take out 
the vegetables. Add more fat or 
butter, if needed, and in it saute* the 
fowl until evenly browned, turning 
often to secure this result. Set the 
fowl in a deep dish. Strain over the 
fat and two cups of boiling water or 
stock made from the giblets, cover 
closely, and bake in a slow oven until 
tender, basting often. About fifteen 
minutes before the fowl is done, skim 
off the fat and thicken the liquid, re- 
maining, with flour mixed with water 
to pour. Cook slices of carrot in boil- 
ing water until tender, season with salt 
and butter, and dispose in small mounds 
at the ends of the serving-dish on 
which the fowl is placed.

SPARE not, nor spend 
Spare but to spend, 

OFTEN our ideas of economy 
are warped and strange in- 
deed. There is no true econ- 
omy where satisfaction is wanting. 
Without satisfaction, no matter how 
small the accounts foot up, there is 
more loss than gain. Judicious spend- 
ing rather than doing without is true 
economy. 

Take, for instance, the one item of 
flour. Many housekeepers consider it 
quite extravagant to keep a supply of 
both bread and pastry flour, and, as 
for keeping constantly on hand, as 
well, rye flour and meal, entire-wheat 
and Graham flour, yellow and white 
corn-meal and buckwheat flour, such 
extravagance is unwarranted outside 
of a hotel or boarding-house. As to 
bread and pastry flour, it is conceded 
by those who know, that less flour, by 
weight, is needed to make a given quan- 
tity of bread, when bread flour is used. 
But bread flour will not make so deli- 
cate pastry and cake as the more 
starchy pastry flour. Thus both kinds 
of flour would seem to be in the line 
of economy. 

Then, if supplies are not particularly 
varied and much bread needs be eaten, 
think of the changes in this one article 
that may be presented, if one but have 
on hand divers kinds of meal and flour. 
With such diversity the art and skill 
of the cook can make economy and 
satisfaction more than possible. 



much, be this thy care, 
and only spend to spare. 

Randolph. 

Often, in institutions where large 
numbers are fed, but one kind of bread, 
as Boston brown bread, is served at 
a meal. This is a mistake. Boston 
brown bread can be so cooked as to 
be most wholesome. Long cooking is 
essential, and recooking or resteaming 
is to be commended. But even then 
there are individuals who cannot eat 
a dish in which corn-meal is chief in- 
gredient, and there may be times when 
even the most ardent admirer of this 
dish cannot partake of it with impunity. 
Is not, then, a second choice of an en- 
tirely different kind of bread most de- 
sirable ? 

Potato and Celery Salads 
Potato and celery salads are given 
in this month's recipes. Salads are 
very good or very bad. There is no half- 
way ground in this matter, and this 
is especially true of the foregoing 
salads. It is impossible to set down 
the exact proportions and quantities 
of oil, acid, and condiments needed to 
dress any salad, nor is it possible to 
prescribe an exact method of mixing 
the various ingredients. 

Cold potatoes swimming in oil are 
far from palatable or hygienic, and such 
a combination can lay no claim to the 
name of salad. Potatoes, without flavor 
themselves, can be made into a good 
salad, because they can be made a 
medium of earning other flavors.

Onion is as necessary to a successful 
potato salad as is oil and acid, nor must 
salt be lacking. Potatoes have an 
affinity for salt and onion and oil, also, 
judging by the quantity they can be 
made to take up. Coarse pieces of 
crude, uncooked onion or cruder garlic 
will not do. For a small quantity of 
salad, rubbing over the bowl with the 
crushed half of a clove of garlic will 
give flavor enough to inoculate the 
whole. A slight grating of mild Span- 
ish onion or a tablespoonful or two of 
fine-chopped chives will also prove 
quite sufficient. But think not to 
make a satisfactory potato salad with- 
out calling into requisition some mem- 
ber of this useful family. 

We speak of "tossing up" a salad. 
This would seem to indicate that a 
salad is put together quickly; but there 
are salads and salads, and the time to 
be expended on the mixing of them 
must be gauged by the knowledge of 
the salad-maker. If he (or she) have 
not a mental picture, and palate pic- 
ture as well, of what the finished pro- 
duct should be, the salad cannot fail 
to be other than disappointing. Of 
course, one may have moments of in- 
spiration, when the understanding is 
so quickened that a salad of unsur- 
passed merit is evolved. Still, every- 
day, prosaic people cannot trust to in- 
spiration, but need consider and weigh 
with care the composition and qualities 
of the article to be dressed. Potato 
needs be turned over and over again in 
the dressing, until one's stock of pa- 
tience is well-nigh exhausted. Then, 
and not till then, may they be set aside 
to become thoroughly impregnated 
with the seasonings and oil, "to ripen/' 
as it were. 

Not after the same fashion can we 
treat the ingredients of the celery and 
apple salad. Long standing in the 
dressing would wilt the celery, which, 
to be at its best, must not have parted 
with its pristine crispness. Nor will 



it take up a tithe of the dressing pre- 
pared for an equal bulk of potato ; yet 
it needs be dressed, "fatigued," the 
French say — with care and discrimina- 
tion. A judicious pressure must be 
brought to bear upon its unabsorbent 
texture, to force it to take up a modi- 
cum of those elements which it lacks, 
to make a complete dish. Often the 
more clinging nature of the sauce may- 
onnaise commends it to our favor, 
when celery is to be dressed for other 
than a dinner salad. 

Salt and Smoked Fish 

Fresh fish is not obtainable by all 
housekeepers, but with careful, pains- 
taking cookery finnan haddie (smoked 
haddock), salt mackerel, salmon, and 
codfish are not to be despised. Every- 
thing depends upon the cooking. We 
have eaten the appetizing finnan haddie 
(the usual price is twelve and a half 
cents a pound) when every mouthful 
as it melted in the mouth called for 
a song of praise in honor of the cook 
and the man who first "cured" finnan 
haddie. Then, again, we have eaten 
this same fish so poorly cooked that, 
had we not known its possibilities, we 
should have felt no inclination to have 
the fish again included in our table 
supplies. Salt hardens the fibre of 
fish, and, no matter how salt fish is to 
be cooked, the temperature must not 
reach the boiling-point. Salt codfish 
needs stand over night in cold water, 
then, covered with fresh water, to be 
brought just to the boiling-point. Salt 
mackerel needs stand in cold water, 
skin side up, from twenty-four to thirty- 
six hours, and salt salmon from thirty- 
six to forty-eight hours, the water 
being changed several times mean- 
while. After this preliminary soaking 
either fish may be broiled or "boiled" 
(cooked in water at or just below sim- 
mering-point) . The woman with an eye 
to economy will study the possibilities 
of cured fish, as an occasional dish.

But let her see to it that the dish, when 
set on the family table the first time, 
has been so carefully manipulated that 
it is beyond reproach. 

Hollandaise Sauce 

The best approved sauce for some 
vegetables, as cauliflower and most 
fresh fish, served baked or boiled, is 
the sauce Hollandaise. Every one who 
has tried her hand on ambitious dishes 
has attempted Hollandaise sauce, and 
with varying success. Often the ex- 
perimenter has declared: "It was just 
right, almost as thick as mayonnaise. 
I left it to take up the fish ; and, when 
I was ready for it, the sauce had 
curdled." Do these experimenters 
make boiled custard? They under- 
stand quite well that, when a boiled 
custard has reached a certain stage, it 
must be taken from the hot bath at 
once. The principle is the same in 
both cases, but the application is not 
made. Dish the fish or vegetable, 
and then, everything being ready be- 
forehand, make the sauce. Then, if 
the sauce should curdle, here is the 
remedy: Have ready one-fourth a 
cup of Bechamel or white sauce. When 
hot and perfectly smooth, gradually 
beat in the curdled mixture, and a 
smooth Hollandaise results, which can 
in no wise be distinguished from the 
real Hollandaise which you set out to 
make. Or start out with the given 
quantity of Bechamel sauce, adding it 
to the vinegar reduced with the pepper- 
corns, and into this beat the yolks of 
eggs, and then the butter, little by little.

The Up-to-date Waitress 




Serving Dinner 

DINNER being a formal meal, 
we select it as the one best 
adapted to illustrate the Rus- 
sian manner of serving; i.e., from the 
side. This is not only the most ele- 
gant, but the simplest style of service, 
where waitress or other attendants 
pass everything. When it is desired 
to serve dinner from the table (English 
style), follow out the general plan 
given in the preceding paper for serv- 
ing breakfast, making only such changes 
as are needed to adapt the service to 
the required meal. 

Laying the Dinner Table for Rus- 
sian Service 

Lay the table according to the di- 
rections given in a former article on 
English service until it comes to the 
arranging of the "covers." For these 
use a plate of dinner size. Place a 
dinner knife at the right of the plate, 
cutting edge toward the plate, beyond 
this the spoon for soup. This may be 
a table or dessert spoon or a round- 
bowled soup spoon. If raw oysters or 
clams are to be served, lay an oyster 
fork across the soup spoon or beyond 
it to the right. When canapes take 
the place of oysters, a small fork takes 
the place of the oyster fork. On the 
left dispose the forks in order of use, 
just as on the right, the utensil *o be 
used first being farthest from the plate, 
as fork for fish, entree, roast and 
game. This array of cutlery being 
quite enough to occupy the space al- 
lotted to a cover, forks for additional 
entries and the forks and spoons 



needed for the dessert service are usu- 
ally passed when needed. At the left 
of the forks lay the napkin, a roll or 
piece of bread between the folds, but 
in sight. Occasionally we see a roll 
laid on the top of the napkin, but a 
partial covering with the napkin is 
preferable. Near the point of the 
dinner knife set the glass for water, 
and beside this the glass for Apollinaris 
or charged water. Or, if wine be served, 
the glass for water is set nearly in 
front of the plate, the glass for sau- 
terne at the tip of the soup spoon, and 
that for sherry between the three, 
forming a half-circle. Back of these, 
forming a second half-circle, with the 
sauterne glass as the first in the circle, 
place the glasses for claret and cham- 
pagne to accompany the roast and 
game, respectively. 

Place salt and pepper cups and 
spoons, or shakers, between each two 
covers. The floral decorations and 
the candelabra or candlesticks placed 
symmetrically upon the table complete 
the laying of the table. We will sup- 
pose that the table is laid for six covers, 
and that the following menu is to be 
served by one waitress. No wine is in- 
cluded in the menu: —

With everything ready beforehand 
a well-trained waitress, seconded by a 
cook with whom she works harmoni- 
ously, can serve this meal with ease 
and celerity. With a larger number 
of covers an extra maid in the pantry 
to clear away the dishes or, in the 
dining-room, to follow the waitress 
with the accessories of the dish she is 
serving — as the pulled bread, olives, 
and celery served with soup — will tend 
to smoother and shorter service. 

Announcing the Dinner 

The oysters on the deep shell, lying 
on plates of crushed ice with a quar- 
ter of a lemon in the centre of each 
plate, are in place upon the service 
plate at each cover, and the glasses 
are filled with water, when the waitress, 
stepping to the entrance of the room 
where the guests are assembled, says, 
"Dinner is served." When all are 
seated, she passes the brown bread 
sandwiches to the left of each in turn, 
beginning on the right or left of the 
host, at pleasure. This course finished, 
the plates are removed from the right, 
one at a time, beginning with the one 
first served. These plates, as are all 
soiled plates, are deposited in the 
pantry. 



Serving the Soup 

The waitress now brings in two plates 
of soup, one in each hand. The plate 
in her left hand is set down upon the 
serving table, the other is set down 
upon the service plate of the guest 
sitting on the opposite side of the host 
from the one served first with sand- 
wiches. The second plate of soup, 
brought from the serving table, is set 
down, from the right, before the guest 
next in order. Twp more plates of 
soup are brought in as before, and this 
routine is repeated until all are served 
in order, the host being served last. 
The pulled bread, olives, and celery 
are now passed upon a tray to the left 
of the one first served with soup, who 
helps herself to what she wishes. The 
service or place plate now comes into 
use as the receptacle upon which these 
articles are placed. At discretion, the 
bread may be passed first, and be fol- 
lowed by the celery and olives, together, 
on the tray. 

Side at which Dishes are set down 

and presented 

Note that dishes are set down and 
removed from the right of the individ- 
ual served, and that dishes from which 
one is to help himself are presented at 
the left hand. The reason for this is 
obvious, when one tries to reverse the 
procedure. 

Removing the Soup Plates 

When this course is finished, step to 
the right of the one first served, take 
up the soup plate, leaving the other 
plate in position, and carry it to the 
pantry. Continue in order until all 
are removed. 

Serving the Fish (ist) 

. The fish may be served in one of 
two ways: First, the "turbans" may 
be disposed on a large platter with the 
sauce around it, the whole handsomely 



The Up-to-Date Waitress 



371 



decorated, and the diamonds of potato 
upon another platter, neatly garnished 
with parsley. Carry a warm plate 
from the serving table to the guest at 
the right or left of the host, and con- 
tinue in order until all the plates are 
in place, then carry the platter of 
fish, on a folded napkin laid on the 
flat of the hand, to the right of the one 
first supplied with a plate. Place a 
turban of fish and sauce upon the plate. 
Repeat until all are served. Then serve 
the potato diamonds in the same 
manner. 

Serving the Fish (2d) 

Have the fish plates prepared in the 
pantry, a turban of fish with sauce 
and diamond of potato on each. Bring 
two plates from the pantry, set one 
upon the serving table, and carry the 
other to the first individual to be 
served, and set it down from the right 
upon the place plate. Return for the 
second plate; and, when this is set in 
place, bring in two more plates pre- 
pared as before, and so continue in 
order until all are served with this 
course. 

Serving the Cucumbers 

Bring six chilled plates of small size 
to the serving table. Set one of these 
plates to the right of the water glass 
at each cover, beginning with the guest 
to whom fish was first served. Then, 
carrying the salad bowl, with a spoon 
in the bowl, on a folded napkin laid 
on the flat of the left hand, go to the 
right of each guest, and dispose half a 
dozen slices of cucumber and a little 
dressing upon each plate. If any guest 
signifies that salad is not desired, pass 
quietly on. The cucumbers are eaten 
with the fish fork. 

A separate fork is not necessarily pro- 
vided for a salad served with fish, 
roast, or game. It is always sup- 
plied for salad served as a separate 
course. Remove the cucumber plates 



first, one at a time or one in each 
hand. 

Serving the Entree 

The entree of croquettes with as- 
paragus tips may be disposed on in- 
dividual plates, and set down with the 
right hand upon the service plate as 
the fish plate is taken up with the left 
hand. The retention of the service 
plate gives opportunity to eat the 
celery or olives that may still be upon 
this plate. If preferred, empty plates 
may be set down as the fish plate is 
taken up; and, when those are all in 
place, the croquettes, surrounded with 
the asparagus, may be carried to the 
right of each guest upon the flat of the 
hand, and thus be served from a large 
and handsomely gotten up dish. 

Serving the Turkey and Vegetables 

Bring in two dinner plates holding 
turkey. Leave one on the serving table. 
Then, going to the right or left of the 
host (begin the courses alternately on 
the right and left), take up the service 
plate with the croquette plate upon it, 
and set down the plate of turkey. Con- 
tinue in order, exchanging the service 
and croquette plates for the dinner 
plate until all have been served with 
turkey. Bring in the dish of potato — 
a spoon pressed down into it — on the 
flat of the left hand, a folded napkin be- 
tween the dish and hand. Go to the 
right of each in order, beginning with 
the first one served to turkey, and place 
a "helping" of potato on the plate. 
Serve the giblet sauce, egg plant, and 
cranberry jelly in the order given and 
in the same manner, noting quickly 
the quietly spoken disinclination of a 
guest to be served to any dish. Now, 
if needed, pass bread or rolls to the 
left for each to help himself, and fill 
the glasses with water. While waiting 
for this course to be finished, lay above 
the plate a fork or spoon for the Roman 
punch. As in all cases where an ar- 



37* 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



tide is set down, not passed, set the 
spoons in place from the right of the 
guests. 

Serving the Punch 

When the main course of the dinner 
is finished, bring in two glasses of punch 
on small plates covered with doilies. 
Leave one on the serving table, carry 
the other to the guest at the left of 
the host. If the guest on the right was 
served first to the first course, take up 
the dinner plate with the left hand, and 
set down the punch with the right hand 
and from the right. Repeat until all 
are served. 

Serving the Game Course 

When the punch has been disposed 
of, in the same manner as before, serv- 
ing first the guest at the right of the 
host, replace the plates holding the 
punch glasses with plates upon which 
the venison and rice cups with jelly 
are disposed. When all are served, 
set small plates, one at a time, for those 
wishing salad. These plates may hold 
the salad when brought to the table 
or the salad may be placed upon the 
plates after each has been set in its 
proper place. When this course is 
finished, remove the salad plates, two 
side by side on a tray or one at a time 
without the tray. Then remove the 
game plates, always one at a time, and 



in the same order in which they were 
brought in. 

With a tray take up salt and pepper 
boxes; and, when these have been 
disposed of, return and free the table 
from crumbs. 

Serving the Sweet Course 

Have the moulds of jelly and fruit 
with cream decoration ready on indi- 
vidual plates. Set these, one at a time, 
before each guest, at the right. Bring 
in the finger bowls on small doily- 
covered plates, one at a time, and take 
out the dessert plate. After all are 
provided with these, the bowl and 
doily being removed from the plate, 
pass the bonbons and nuts on a tray 
to the left of each, that each may help 
himself. The almonds may have been 
passed before, as they are in order at 
any time, when there is delay in serving 
a course. Bread is passed and glasses 
filled with water whenever needed. 
Coffee in cups is now brought in and 
set down as usual from the right, and 
cream and sugar on a tray are after- 
wards passed to the left of each guest. 

When the main dish of the dessert is 
not shaped in individual portions, but 
a portion is to be cut for each individ- 
ual, the finger bowls may be brought 
in upon the dessert plates with a doily 
between. These plates suffice for the 
bonbons.

mutton supersedes sheep mutton there. 
In our South-western States and Terri- 
tories kid mutton is not uncommon. 

If you desire an unusual delicacy, 
you can have a guinea pig, either roasted 
or curried, with a rich gravy seasoned 
with a goodly dash of lime juice, 
some onion, and cho-chos, or a roast 
guineafowl, and a glass of Java plum 
wine. 

With rich turtle stews and ices of 
young cocoanuts, limes, and soursops, 



and preserved carambola, a meal should 
be well suited to the most fastidious. 
If only the disobliging thing we call 
tariff would not fend off these things 
from our shores, we might dine and 
sup from Jamaican novelties, and tuck 
preserves of strange tropical things 
away in our sideboards, — in short,

I HAVE seen the question asked sev- 
eral times how to bake a pie to pre- 
vent bottom crust from being soggy. 
I will give you this invaluable piece 
of information. It might help many 
readers. Prepare pie to be filled, 
bottom crust and layers around edge 
of plate for pumpkin and custard. 
I use soup plate, good size. Beat the 
white of one egg with yolk, and with a 
brush brush the entire bottom and 
sides up to the edge pieces, and sprinkle 
with bread crumbs that have been 
grated, — no crusts, the pure white 
crumbs, — about three tablespoonfuls. 
Then add your filling, and put in oven 
at once. Impossible to detect the 
crumbs, and the crust will be dry, per- 
fectly baked, and a beautiful brown on 
the bottom. I do this with all fruit pies 
and liquid and mince pie. Any liquid 
ruins the crust.

THERE is a recipe for real Southern 
gumbo, without the okra, which 
at this season is only found canned. 
Fil6, the substitute for okra, is what 
really makes gumbo, and gives the 
soup the glutinous appearance which is 
one of the distinguishing marks of 
gumbo. Fil6 is a greenish powder, 
made from the dried sassafras root. 
This can be obtained at small cost 
at most first-class groceries. So many 
recipes for gumbo call for a whole 
chicken, which makes the soup very 
expensive. But, now that the sea- 
son of turkey is with us, a good soup 
can be made from the turkey carcass. 
Pick off any meat, both light and dark, 



remaining on the turkey, and put it 
with the carcass into one quart of 
water, with one onion, cut fine, a bay 
leaf, and one tablespoonful of butter. 
Place the kettle over a moderate fire, 
and bring it to a boil. Skim carefully 
at the first boil, and then let the soup 
simmer for two hours. Next add one 
tablespoonful of fil£. Drain fifty oys- 
ters, and stir them into the gumbo with 
salt and cayenne to taste. Remove 
the bones of the turkey, and serve with 
rice that has been boiled separately. 
If you have a ham bone or any left- 
over turkey gravy, this, added to the 
gumbo at the first boil, makes the soup 
richer.

Food Exhibit 

The Women's Educational and In- 
dustrial Union of Boston with the co- 
operation of domestic science schools 
and classes, cooks of the domestic re- 
form league, public school classes, and 
other organizations recently held a 
food exhibit. This exhibition was the 
first of the kind ever held in Boston, 
and it aroused considerable interest 
among those private individuals who 
are specially interested in cooking for 
profit, as well as housekeepers looking 
for choice articles of home production. 
Awards were given only to articles of 
high excellence. The classes of articles 
exhibited were included under breads, 
miscellaneous (broths, soups; meats, 
croquettes, fish balls, meat pies, potato 
chips, etc.), cakes, pastry, and pies, 
puddings, candies (nuts, corn-balls),

jellies, and preserves, pickles, sauces, 
salad dressings, mince meat, etc. After 
the exhibition the food was sold to the 
general public, and the money used to 
defray expenses. If a surplus remains, 
it will be kept as a fund for future ex- 
hibits. 

Scientific Reasons for Dietetic 

Habits 

There are many eating habits which, 
though followed merely because they 
have been customary from time im- 
memorial, really have a scientific basis. 
Such is the eating of butter with bread, 
which by itself, though rich in starch 
and having a fair proportion of proteid, 
— at all events, when made of whole- 
meal flour, — has not the fat which is 
dietetically necessary. Similarly with 
rice puddings, the milk is added to 
make up for the deficiency of proteid 
in the rice. The scientific justification 
for adding milk to, tea is, however, of 
quite a different kind. As mentioned 
in a recent issue in connection with the 
danger of taking meat with tea, the 
tannic acid contained in the latter com- 
bines with albumen to form tannate 
of albumen, which is practically leather, 
so that by drinking tea the coating of 
the stomach is made leathery. But 
milk also contains albumen, and, when 
milk is added to tea, the molecules of 
tannic acid select their albumen from 
it; and, as a divorce is unknown to 
tannate of albumen, the albumen of 
the stomach is less liable to be affected 
by tannic acid than it would be if the 
tea were taken alone. Then there is 
a chemical reason for adding vinegar 
to salads. Raw vegetables are easily 
enough digested by cows and horses, 
but with difficulty by the human 
stomach, because they contain that 
hard, fibrous substance, cellulose. But 
acids dissolve cellulose to some extent, 
and vinegar is an acid. That is why 
it is a good thing to take vinegar or 
lemon juice with salad and cabbage, 



and doubtless that is why it tastes so 
well; for the palate is an excellent 
judge of what is good for the stomach. 
The justification for adding oil is partly 
that there is practically no fat in the 
salad itself and partly that it protects 
the lining of the stomach from the ac- 
tion of the acid in vinegar. 



Kitchens of To-day 

Kitchens are not what they were, as 
any one who looks over the new and 
artistic ones that are being built to-day 
must realize. No one wonders to find 
them being made more and more sani- 
tary, for growing attention to that 
state has been given for some time, but 
the really beautiful ones that are being 
fitted out now do surprise us. Who 
ever thought of a color scheme for the 
kitchen, of all rooms in the house ? Yet 
that is what is followed out most care- 
fully now, and the result is so pleasant 
a work-room that it ought to inspire a 
cheerful disposition in a cook and a 
fortunate skill to her hands. 

Blue and white, making a delft 
kitchen, is deservedly a favorite effect; 
for it gives all that cleanly and dainty 
appearance that should be seen where 
food is prepared. Green and white or 
brown and yellow are equally pleasing, 
when properly combined. 

Of course, the foundation of all this 
decorative effect must be the best 
planned and arranged kitchen possible. 
All the colors of the rainbow could not 
make the place what it properly should 
be without these. Before taking a 
house or an apartment or before doing 
over an old kitchen, look this room over 
carefully, and in this inspection begin 
with the floor. 

Nothing is so clean and satisfactory 
as tiles, and next to that hard wood. 
Ash makes a flooring that planes down 
well and lies compactly, but oak is, 
after all, the most useful of woods. —

Qubry 978. — (Continued.) 

Fish Bechamel Sauce 

Let the bones and trimmings of 
the fish simmer, with a slice of onion 
and of carrot and a bag of sweet herbs, 
until a well-flavored stock is formed. 
Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Cook in it three tablespoonfuls of flour, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, and 
a dash of pepper. When frothy, beat 
in gradually one cup of the fish stock 
and half a cup of cream. Add more 
seasoning as needed and a teaspoonful 
of lemon juice. The liquid in the pan 
in which the fish is cooked may be 
used as a part of the stock. This is 
a delicious sauce. For a change omit 
the sauce, and prepare the potatoes 
after the following fashion, when the 
dressing suffices for fish sauce. 

Potatoes a la Maitre d' Hotel 

Boil one pint of potato balls, cut 
with French cutter, in boiling salted 
water until tender, no longer. Drain, 
and add a generous half-cup of milk. 
Cream two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Beat in the yolks of two eggs, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pa- 
prika, and, when the milk is hot, beat 
in the tgg mixture. Add also a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice and a table- 
spoonful of chopped parsley. 

Rechauffee of Lamb, Creole Style 
Cook two tablespoonfuls of green 



pepper and one tablespoonful of onion, 
chopped fine, in three tablespoonfuls 
of butter until yellowed and softened. 
Add three tablespoonfuls of flour anji 
halt a teaspoonful of salt, and cook 
until frothy, then gradually add one 
cup of brown stock and half a cup of 
tomato pur£e. Stir until the sauce 
boils, then add a grating of fresh horse- 
radish with half a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice, and two cups of cooked lamb 
cut in thin small slices. Serve with a 
border of plain boiled rice. 

An Italian Cheese Dish 

Mix one-fourth of a cup, each, of corn- 
starch and flour, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, and half a teaspoonful of paprika, 
with milk to pour, and stir into the 
remainder of a pint of milk, scalded in 
the double boiler. Stir constantly until 
the mixture thickens, and occasionally 
for twenty minutes, then add the yolks 
of two eggs, mixed with one-fourth a 
cup of creamed butter and half a cup 
of grated cheese. Stir until the cheese 
is melted and the egg is cooked, then 
turn into a shallow dish. When cold, 
cut in diamonds, dispose in a baking- 
dish, and sprinkle with half a cup 
of grated cheese. Reheat in a hot 
oven.

bowl. Soften a scant half-package of 
gelatine in half a cup of cold water. 
Cook half a cup of sugar to caramel. 
Add one-fourth a cup of boiling water, 
and let simmer until the caramel is dis- 
solved. Add hot milk to the caramel, 
to make a cup in all, and pour this 
over the softened gelatine. Add three- 
fourths a cup of chopped-and-browned 
almonds, and stir the mixture over 
ice water until it begins to set, then 
fold in the cream. Have ready a 
mould lined with waxed paper and 
lady fingers. When the cream mixt- 
ure is stiff enough to hold its shape, 
turn it into the mould. 



Query 979. — Housekeeper, Industrial 
School, Boston: "Recipe for simple bread 
pudding." 

Simple Bread Pudding 

Remove the crusts from enough 
bread to make a quart when pressed 
through a colander or cut into very 
small pieces. Let stand in a quart 
of milk about half an hour. Beat 
three or four eggs. Gradually beat 
in two cups of sugar, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and a little powdered nutmeg 
or mace. Add one quart of milk, 
and stir into the bread and milk mixt- 
ure. Bake until the centre is firm. 
This pudding is not very sweet. Half 
a cup of sugar may be added to the 
quantity given, or the following sauce 
may be served with it. To vary the 
pudding, occasionally add a cup of 
cleaned currants or raisins, or melt 
two squares of chocolate over hot 
water, cook smooth with one-fourth 
a cup, each, of sugar, and boiling 
water, and stir into the bread and 
milk. 

Sauce for Bread Pudding 

Sift together very thoroughly a cup 
of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and half a cup of flour. Pour on one 
quart of boiling water, and stir and 



cook until the sauce boils. Let sim- 
mer five or six minutes, then add two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and a grat- 
ing of nutmeg. The chocolate given 
above may be added to the sauce in- 
stead of the pudding. 

Bread Pudding (Mock Indian) 

Cut stale bread in half-inch slices, 
and remove the crusts. Butter the 
bread on both sides, pile the slices 
together, and cut in cubes. To each 
cup of cubes, well pressed down, use 
one pint of milk, half a cup of molasses, 
and half a teaspoonful of salt. Bake 
in a buttered pudding-dish, in a very 
moderate oven, from two to three 
hours. Fine-chopped suet may take 
the place of the butter. Put it be- 
tween the bread and cut as before. 



Query 980. — Miss F. M. W. f Charlotte- 
town, P.E.I. : "Recipe for preparing liver and 
bacon. What does entire wheat mean? Is 
it Graham flour or rolled wheat? How may 
a thick steak be cooked over a hard-coal fire 
without burning the edges? When should 
celery and cheese be served at a dinner? If 
served at the end, should the 'salts' be re- 
moved when clearing the table for the sweet 
course?" 

Broiled Liver and Bacon 

For broiling bacon see page 308 
of the January magazine. Cut the 
liver in narrow slices, half an inch 
thick, cover with boiling water, and 
let stand five minutes. Wipe dry, 
then dip in the bacon fat, and put be- 
tween the bars of the broiler. Broil 
five minutes, turning every ten sec- 
onds. Serve with the bacon. 

Fried Liver and Bacon 

Cook the bacon, sliced thin, in the 
frying-pan, watching constantly, and 
turning as needed, to insure the even 
cooking of the slices. Slice and par- 
boil the liver as before, then dip it in 
flour, and fry in the bacon fat, first on 
one side and then on the other. 



Queries and Answers 



377 



Liver and Bacon Fried in 

Deep Fat 

Prepare the liver as given above. 
After it is wiped dry, rub over each 
slice with the cut side of an onion, 
season with pepper and salt, roll in 
flour, then dip in beaten egg, then roll 
in bread crumbs, and fry in deep fat. 
Do not have the fat too hot. The 
liver should cook nearly five minutes, 
without being too brown. Roll the 
slices of bacon, push a wooden tooth- 
pick through each, to hold it in shape, 
then fry about one minute in the deep 
fat. Remove the toothpicks before 
serving. 

Entire Wheat 

Entire- wheat flour is neither Graham 
flour nor rolled wheat. It is fine flour, 
dark in color. Except in color it 
makes bread similar to ordinary bread 
flour. 

How cook a Thick Steak 

A steak two inches thick requires 
from fifteen to twenty minutes in 
broiling. (See page 309, January mag- 
azine.) Put the steak to cook quite 
near the coals. After two or three 
minutes, or when the steak is seared 
upon the outside, remove it at least 
four inches from the coals, and turn 
often, once in three or four minutes. 
If cooked at a proper distance from 
the coals, the edges of the steak should 
not be burned. 

Service of Celery and Cheese at 

Dinner 

At a formal dinner, celery is served 
with soup. If it be served later in 
the meal, it should first be dressed. 
A savory tidbit, often omitted at the 
close of a dinner, is considered most 
fit for the end of the formal meal. 
This may be a bit of choice cheese, 
tiny cheese souffles, anchovies in some 
form, canapes, celery stalks stuffed 



with a highly seasoned mixture, etc. 
Whatever is served here should be 
small, choice, highly flavored, and 
ready for eating. At a less formal 
meal of fewer courses, a cooked cheese 
dish with a salad, or even plain celery, 
might take the place of the game course. 
In this case, coming before the sweet 
course, — if one be served, — the "salts" 
are on the table. 



Qubry 981. — Mrs. R. W. T., Boston, Mass.: 
"Is it correct to sprinkle salt on roasts of 
lamb or beef when putting them in the oven ? 
When roasting meat, is it best to put water 
in the pan, unless the oven be too hot ?" 

Use of Salt and of Water in 

Roasting Meat 

Salt draws out juice from fresh 
meat, thus its use would be interdicted 
until after the meat was seared over 
by the heat of the oven. Salt also 
hardens fibre. Thus, after the juice 
has been imprisoned, the salt put into 
the pan and dipped up with the fat 
in basting would help in forming a 
crust to keep in the juices. Fat, not 
water, is needed to baste meat; but 
dark browned fat is not wholesome, 
and the oven should be kept at a 
temperature at which the fat will 
not be over-cooked. 



Query 982. — Mrs. H. J. P., New Rochelle, 
N.Y. : " Recipes for tomato bouillon and cheese 
sticks." 

Tomato Bouillon 

A recipe for bouillon made of beef 
was given in the March, 1904, maga- 
zine. Take one quart of bouillon, 
made by this recipe, and one quart of 
strained tomato, and mix with slightly 
beaten whites and the crushed shells 
of three eggs. Stir over the fire until 
the boiling-point is reached. Let boil 
five minutes, then simmer a few mo- 
ments. Let stand to settle, and strain 
through several folds of cheese-cloth,

laid over a colander. Other broth, 
as chicken or veal, may be used. (See 
recipe for standard broth in the Jan- 
uary, 1905, magazine.) Or a quart 
of tomato stewed with half an onion, 
three stalks of celery, a "soup bag" 
(bag "of sweet herbs), half a carrot, 
and a teaspoonful of salt and a quart 
of water may be cooked twenty min- 
utes. Strain, dilute with water to 
a good consistency, then clear as be- 
fore with the white and shells of three 
eggs for each two quarts of liquid. 

Cheese Sticks 

Cut rye, whole-wheat, or Graham 
bread into slices half an inch thick. Cut 
these into half-inch strips the width 
of the slice, and remove all crust. 
Grate two ounces of cheese, — Edam or 
pineapple is good for this purpose, — 
add a dash of paprika, and beat into 
two ounces of butter, beaten to a 
cream. Spread this mixture on the 
strips of bread, and set them into the 
oven to melt the cheese. Serve with 
a fresh green salad. 



Qubry 983. — Mrs. E. M. P., Chamal, Mex- 
ico: "Garabanzas grow here in abundance. 
Would be glad of a satisfactory way of cook- 
ing them. Would also tike to know if jelly 
can be made of oranges. Have tried it, but 
without success." 

Cooking of Garabanzas (Mrs Kean) 

Garabanzas (field peas) may be 
cooked like Boston baked beans. They 
may also be cooked in soup, in 
"gumbo"; and in Mexico the most 
common way is said to be in a dish 
called "Olla." This dish is composed 
of meat, a piece of cabbage, a whole 
carrot, turnip, banana, a flower from 
a pumpkin vine, a sprig of coriander, 
and a few garabanzas. These are 
simmered together in an earthen pot, 
or "olla." To prepare for cooking, 
let the "garabanzas" (also spelled 
garbancos) stand over night, covered 



with plenty of cold water, then drain, 
and set to boil, to loosen the skins. 
When these have been taken off, they 
are ready for cooking. They are often 
cooked in broth, flavored with a sauted 
onion and tomato. After soaking over 
night and cooking half an hour or 
more, the garabanzas can be freed 
from skin. The skin is tough, like an 
almond skin. 

Cooking of Garabanzas 

(Mr. McNalley) 

Some garabanzas need much more 
cooking than others. In baking them 
(they must first be boiled to remove 
the skin), the natives add salt, pepper, 
and lard, but bacon is preferable to 
the latter item. In some sections of 
the country, either on account of the 
variety of the vegetable or on account 
of the altitude or kind of water used 
in cooking, — rain water is best, — it is 
impossible to cook them tender; and 
they are usually ground on a rock. 
At a hotel, in a small town where I 
once stopped, goat meat soup with 
garabanzas was served every day for 
a month; and the peas were like bul- 
lets, not fit to be eaten. I have also 
seen them cooked like dried butter 
beans, and dressed with butter, pepper, 
and salt. 

Orange Marmalade Jelly 

Cut six pounds of Seville oranges 
into thin slices. Take out the seeds, 
then boil in six quarts of water, and 
strain through a thin cotton bag. To 
each pint of juice add a pound of 
sugar, and boil about half an hour, 
or until it will set when cooled. This 
recipe, sent by Mrs. Chandler, was 
published by us about two years ago. 
We have not tried it, but would sug- 
gest cutting down the quantity, by 
which means it might probably be 
cooked a shorter time after the addi- 
tion of the sugar. Long cooking de- 
tracts from the fiesh flavor of fruit. 



The increased use of Royal Baking Powder risen 
food will somewhat alleviate the inconvenience which 
housekeepers suffer from the prevailing high prices of 
many articles of food. 

In yeast made bread a large percentage of flour is 
destroyed- to produce the gas which leavens it. In 
home-made Royal Baking Powder bread all this is 
saved. 

A large part of a loaf of bread is water. When 
you buy bread you pay for water at the price of Hour. 
In cake sometimes a quarter of the weight is water. 

Royal Baking Powder will save a third of the eggs 
in a cake, and make the cake equally fine and more 
healthful. Besides, there is a satisfaction in serving cake 
of your own making. 

Use more cake, hot biscuit, bread, rolls, and pastry, 
and make them at home. You will be surprised in the 
saving and at the superiority of your foods.

"Recipes for celery root salad, shrimp soup 
made of fresh shrimps, white stock, and mint 
jelly." 

Celery Root Salad 

Wash and scrape the roots, then 
cook in boiling salted water until ten- 
der. Drain, sprinkle with salt, and 
set aside, covered, to cool. When 
cold, cut in half-inch cubes. Pour 
over a pint of cubes about five table- 
spoonfuls of olive oil, mixed with a 
little salt and pepper. Turn the pieces 
of vegetables over and over with a 
fork and spoon, to cause them to take 
up the oil, then pour over about three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and mix 
again. Serve on lettuce leaves. The 
whites of two cooked eggs, cut in small 
pieces, and the yolks sifted, may be 
mixed with the celery root before the 
addition of the oil. Mayonnaise dress* 
ing may be used instead of the simple 
oil and vinegar. A little grated onion 
may be added, or the salad fork, and 
spoon may be rubbed with a clove of 
garlic cut in halves. 

Shrimp Soup made with Stock 

Remove the skins or thin shells 
from half a pound of fresh shrimps. 
Simmer the shells in two quarts of 
soup stock — made of fish, veal,*' or 
chicken — twenty minutes. Stir half 
a cup of flour with water to pour, ^ then 
dilute it with a little of the hot liquid ; 
and, when evenly blended, stir it into 
the rest of the liquid. Let boil three 
or four minutes, then strain over the 
shrimps. Let simmer (not boil) five 
or six minutes. Add the juice of 
half a lemon, half a teaspoonful of 
paprika, salt as needed, and beat in 
one-fourth a cup of butter. Add the 
butter little by little. 

Mint Jelly 

Boil one cup of sugar and one cup 
of vinegar five or six minutes after 
boiling fairly begins. Add one table- 
spoonful of gelatine, softened in cold 



water to cover, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful, each, of salt and paprika, and 
three-fourths a cup of mint (well 
pressed down), chopped fine. Stir (in 
a pan of ice water) until the mixture 
begins to thicken, then turn into a 
jelly tumbler or small mould. 



Might have Saved It 

A Lot of Trouble from too much Starchy Food 

A little boy of eight years, whose 
parents did not feed him on the right 
kind of food, was always nervous, and 
suffered from a weak condition of the 
stomach and bowels. Finally, he was 
taken down with appendicitis, and, after 
the operation, the doctor, knowing that 
his intestinal digestion was very weak, 
put him on Grape-nuts twice a day. 

He rapidly recovered; and about 
two months thereafter his father states, 
"He has grown to be strong, muscular, 
and sleeps sound, weighs- sixty- two 
pounds, and his whole system is in a 
fine condition of health." Name given 
by Postum Company, Battle Creek, 
Mich. 

It is plain that, if he had been put 
on Grape-nuts at an earlier period in 
his life, and kept from the use of foods 
that he could not digest, he never 
would have had appendicitis. That 
disease is caused by undigested food 
decaying in the stomach and bowels, 
causing irritation and making for the 
growth of all kinds of microbes, setting 
up a diseased condition which is the 
active cause of appendicitis; and this 
is more marked with people who do 
not properly digest white bread. 

Grape-nuts is made of the selected 
parts of wheat and barley, and by the 
peculiar processes of the cooking at the 
factory all of the starch is turned into 
sugar ready for immediate digestion 
and the more perfect nourishment of 
all parts of the body, particularly the 
brain and nerve centres.

Secret Worker 

The Plan upon which Coffee operates 

Coffee is such a secret worker that 
it is not suspected as the cause of sick- 
ness or disease, but there is a very 
sure way to find' out the truth. 

A lady in Memphis gives an interest- 
ing experience her husband had with 
coffee. It seems that he had been 
using it for some time, and was an 
invalid. 

The physician in charge shrewdly 
suspected that coffee was the "worm 
at the root of the tree," and ordered 
it discontinued, with instructions to use 
Postum Food Coffee regularly in its 
place. 

The wife says: "We found that was 
the true remedy for his stomach and 
heart trouble, and we would have 
gladly paid a hundred times the amount 
of the doctor's charge when we found 
how wise his judgment was. 

"The use of Postum instead of coffee 
was begun about a year ago, and it has 
made my husband a strong, well man. 
He has gained thirty-five pounds in 
that time, and his stomach and heart 
trouble have all disappeared. 

"The first time I prepared it, I did 
not boil it long enough, and he said 
there was something wrong with it. 
Sure enough, it did taste very flat, but 
the next morning I followed directions 
carefully, boiling it for fifteen minutes, 
and he remarked, 'This is better than 
any of the old coffee.' 

"We use Postum regularly, and 
never tire of telling our friends of the 
benefit we have received from leaving 
off the old-fashioned coffee." Name 
given by Postum Company, Battle 
Creek, Mich.

fat until nicely browned, then take up 
and drain. Saute one-fourth a pound 
of lean ham, cut into small cubes, and 
also a small onion, peeled and cut in 
slices, and half a cup of blanched rice. 
Stir until the whole is browned, then 
add three tomatoes, peeled and cut 
in quarters, half a sweet pepper, cut 
in strips, one pint of stock or water, 
and, if desired, half a cup of white 
wine. Let simmer half an hour. Dis- 
pose half of the rice in a casserole. 
In this lay the pieces of rabbit; season 
as needed, adding a little more stock. 
Then cover with the rest of the rice, 
put the cover in place, and cook in a 
moderate oven an hour or longer, ac- 
cording to the tenderness of the rab- 
bit. If the stock be not well seasoned, 
add salt to the rice when first cooked. 

Pigeons in Casserole, Spanish 
Style 

Singe, draw, and truss four or five 
pigeons. Put them into a frying-pan 
with one-fourth a cup of butter, or fat 
from bacon, and four ounces of raw ham, 
cut in squares. .Saute to a delicate 
brown on all sides, then remove to a 
casserole. Sprinkle in the pan two 
tablespoon fuls of flour, and, when 
blended with the fat, add gradually 
a pint of broth, a bunch of parsley, 
salt, and a piece of sweet red pepper. 
When the sauce boils, turn it over 
the pigeons, put on the cover, and 
seal the dish by pressing over the joint 
of cover and dish a strip of cotton 
cloth, spread with flour paste. Set 
the dish into the oven, and cook slowly 
from two to four hours, according to 
the tenderness of the pigeons. Re- 
move the cloth and paste and the cover. 
Skim off the fat, take out the parsley, 
and add two dozen stoned olives, and 
return, covered, to the oven. Let cook 
ten minutes, then send to table in the 
casserole. 

Any one of these recipes may be 
used for other articles than the ones 
indicated. The preference, however, 



is for birds, game, and domestic fowl. 
Guinea hens are particularly good pre- 
pared in this fashion. 

Fig Paste Confections

press them with a pestle through a 
rather coarse puree sieve. Add one 
pound and a half of powdered sugar, 
mix thoroughly, and let cook in a dou- 
ble boiler, uncovered, until the mixture 
becomes a stiff paste, then turn into 
a dish and set aside to become cold. 
When cold, cut into small pieces, and 
roll them on a board, dredged with 
confectioner's sugar, into balls, and 
press the balls flat, to make thin, 
round cakes about an inch and a half 
in diameter, completely covered with 
the sugar. Pack in boxes with plenty 
of sugar between the layers. 

Hominy Griddle Cakes 
To two cups of hominy, warm enough 
to have the grains distinct, add a tea- 
spoonful of salt, three cups of thick 
sour milk, and the beaten yolks of 
three eggs, and stir in one cup of flour, 
mixed with one level teaspoonful and 
a half of soda. Mix thoroughly, then 
fold in the whites of three eggs, beaten 
dry. Bake by tablespoon fuls on a 
griddle to a golden brown.

The Art of Right Living. By Ellen 

H. Richards. Price 50 cents net; 

postage, 4 cents. Boston: Whitcorab 

& Barrows. 

This is a condensation of a course 
of lectures given at the Summer School 
of the South, Knoxville, Tenn. It is 
in the author's best style and manner, 
and is entirely free from scientific tech- 
nicalities. The author aims in these 
pages to consider the factors which 
go to make up the efficient human 
being, who lives for himself, for so- 
ciety, and for the race. We find these 
factors to be nutrition, sleep, exercise, 
amusements, work, and environment, — 
all tending to health. A chief prob- 
lem in life is how "to retain our ac- 
quired health, strength, and power 
under the conditions imposed upon 
us by modern progress." To the so- 
lution of this problem this book is a 
valuable contribution. From the moral 
point of view the art of right living 
has ever been taught and proclaimed; 



but recently the physical aspect of 
the subject is beginning to receive due 
attention. 

The World's Best Proverbs. By 

George Howard Opdyke. Chicago: 

Laird & Lee. 

Virtue and wisdom can be smuggled 
into a man's soul by a good-natured 
proverb better and deeper than to be 
mortised into it with a wormwood 
mallet and chisel. — Josh Billings. 

Pew realize the pleasure and instruc- 
tion to be found in a frequent review 
of proverbs. Here are stored the treas- 
ures of human thought, the golden 
fruits of knowledge and experience. 
"There seems to be no occurrence in 
human affairs," says Disraeli, "'to which 
some proverb may not be applied. 
A proverb will often cut the knot which 
others in vain are attempting to untie." 

This is a valuable compilation. The 
classification is excellent. "There has

Ethics of Household Economy. By 
E. McPherson Parsons. Price $i 
net; postage, 6 cents. Chicago: Jus- 
titia Publishing Company. 
The title of this book is pretentious, 
and might be misleading. However, 
it does not claim to be a scientific work, 
rather a practical manual for young 
housewives. One might say it was 
written for young people with small 
incomes, from six to fifteen hundred 
a year, who are just beginning house- 
keeping. It shows how to economize 
time, strength, and money, how to 
live within one's means and get the 
best results. Each of the several short 
and readable chapters on the ordinary, 
often trivial, concerns of housekeep- 
ing is full of common sense and sound 
advice. 

Objective and Subjective Mind. By 
Abby Jane Taylor. Price 35 cents 
net ; postage, 3 cents. Chicago : Jus- 
titia Publishing Company. 
The statement is made that man 
has two minds, which may be said to 
correspond to higher and lower self, of 
which much has been written. "Rea- 
soning is the highest function of the 
natural or objective mind. In order 
to reason upon this plane, observation, 
by means of the physical senses, is 
first required ; but the subjective mind 
knows by other means than the physi- 
cal senses. It is the seat of intuition 
and emotion, and the storehouse of 
memory. In other words, the objec- 
tive mind is the function of the physi- 
cal brain, while the subjective is of 
the soul." 

This little brochure — and it can 
be read in half an hour — will be ac- 
ceptable to many serious persons who 
are interested in the trend of recent 
studies in psychology; for, behold! all 
things have become new. 1

WHAT YOU CANT SEE 

THE remark that what you can't see 
doesn't hurt you has long been 
famous. 

Yet this is a very erroneous statement. 
People who have been struck by lightning 
have usually failed to see it coming, and the 
cemeteries are full of dead folks who never 
knew what ailed them. 

Some people say that water that looks so 
clear and sparkling, and tastes so palatable, 
does not need filtering. 

DOESN'T IT? 

Physicians will tell you that it does, and 
the only way to be absolutely safe is to boil 
it or properly filter it. 

Ah I properly filter it I 

Not with sand, charcoal, a piece of lime 
or sponge, but absolutely remove the minut- 
est impurity. 

There is orW one way to do this, — by 
the Pasteur plan, as represented in the Bos- 
ton Water Purifier. 

To those who have a righteous dread of 
what they can't see, who appreciate the fact 
that the lurking typhoid germ escapes the 
sharpest eye, we say, write us at once. You 
can have one of these filters free for 30 days' 
trial. 

Write for our booklet.

The Apple Pic 

BY C 8. JACKSON 

Now, children, dear, come 'round me 

And I will tell to you 
The story of an apple pie; 
But, ah! heigh ho! it makes me sigh 

To think the tale is true. 

There lived not very long ago. 

But very far away, 
Two children who, like some of you. 
Had scarcely anything to do 

But jump about and play. 

One day Aunt Mary was to come. 
They heard with great delight. 
Yet John and Bessie weren't to be 
Allowed to stay downstairs to tea 
And welcome her that night. 

Mamma, she thought an apple pie 

For supper would be fit ; 
And then poor John and Bessie said 
"Alas! we both shall be in bed, 

And never taste a bit." 

The pie was made and put away 

Upon a shelf with care. 
The children by the window stood ; 
And, oh, it smelt so very good, 

As it was cooling there, 

That Johnny said: "I really think 

I will go in and see 
If I can raise the top a bit, 
Then we can have a taste of it. 

Come, Bessie, come with me." 

And so they went and took a spoon, 
And turn by turn they ate. 

It was so good, they ate — ah me! — 

Until they only left, you see, 
The pie crust and — the plate. 

They waited for Aunt Mary long 

When she at last had come, 
She begged mamma to let them stay 
With her to supper for that day. 
The children both were dumb.

Poor Johnny's cheeks grew burning red. 

He glanced at every one; 
And little Bessie hung her head. 
And to herself she quickly said, 

"Ohl what will now be done?" 

The pie was brought, and then papa 

Began to help it soon. 
He cut the crust, and said : " My dear. 
What sort of apple pie is here? 

I only see — a spoon." 

The spoon— ah mel the children both 

Were startled at the sight; 
For now they knew the silent eye 
That looked upon them from the sky 

Had brought their sin to light. 

And now I will not tell you more. 

But hope you all will try 
To learn the lesson of my song, 
And think, when you are doing wrong, 

About the apple pie.

There are no better 

books on the subject of cooking than those by Mrs. Rorer. Her name has 
become a household word and synonymous with all that is good in cooking. 
Her methods are far in advance of all other teachers and writers. Every- 
thing she does is well done, and her story is told in a plain, unvarnished way. 
In her NEW COOK BOOK she covers the entire field of cookery in a manner 
never before attempted. It is a big book of 736 pages, handsomely illustrated. 
Price, $2 net; postage, 20 cents. Send for descriptive circular. 

Then there is her Philadelphia Cook Book, of which over 100,000 have 
been sold. What better evidence of worth than that? The two books are 
entirely dissimilar and constructed on entirely different lines : they do not 
conflict. The price of this is $1.75 ; we pay postage. Bound in washable cloth. 

Then there are books on special topics, such as: 

How to use a Chafing-dish. Cloth, 25 cents. 

Dainties. Cloth, 35 cents, net ; by mail, 38 cents. 

New Salads ; Made-over Dishes ; Bread and Bread-making. 

Each, 50 cents, in cloth. 

Quick Soups ; New Ways for Oysters ; Sandwiches. 

Each, 25 cents, in cloth. 

Home Candy-making; Canning and Preserving. 

Each, 50 cents, in cloth. 

Can be had of all booksellers, or we will mail on receipt of price.

As a stranger in Philadelphia, I was 
much amused by certain provincial- 
isms. One of these was the use of the 
word "off " instead of "from." "Please 
buy flowers off me," say the youthful 
street -venders. One day, while wait- 
ing for some groceries, a young lady, 
evidently unused to housekeeping, ap- 
proached the raw Irish clerk and tim- 
idly asked: "I want some mutton to 
make broth. Shall I get it off the 
neck t" "No, mo'om," was the solemn 
reply, as the clerk pointed to the 
butcher busy at his block, "ye git it 
off that mon." — Presbyterian. 

Asparagus Salad 
Pare and cut into two-inch pieces 
one bunch of asparagus, and boil it in 
salted water till tender. When done, 
drain in a colander, and when cold put 
the asparagus into a salad bowl. Dress 
it either with Slade's Salad Cream or 
with Slade's pepper, salt, oil, and 
vinegar.

What is being Done by Women Graduates 



ONE of the most delightful 
spots in Eastern Massachu- 
setts is included in the college 
town of Wellesley. The broad, roll- 
ing hilltops, crowned here and there 
with a college house or hall, the wealth 
of luxuriant and stately trees, the beau- 
tiful lake, and the deep blue sky over all, 
combine to form a picture that lives in 
the memory of those who have gazed 
upon it. Ten minutes' walk from the 
hilltops toward the railroad station 
brings the visitor to one of the 
more recent college "institutions," the 
Wellesley Inn. 

Thirty years ago an establishment 



like the Wellesley Inn, conducted by 
women, was undreamed of, — in fact, 
uncalled for. But, when the need arose, 
women appeared qualified and equipped 
to meet the requirements. 

The Wellesley Inn was by no means 
the first venture of the kind in this 
country, for the Margaret Louise Home 
in New York City, though it caters to 
self-supporting women, is, to all in- 
tents and purposes, a woman's inn. 

The object of the Wellesley Inn is 
to provide a temporary, college home 
for a score or more of undergraduates 
and, at the same time, a hostelry for 
alumnae, parents, and friends of the 



382 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



students, who may wish to visit the 
college. Besides caring for these, it is 
an inn in the broadest sense, for here 
the chance visitor of an hour may find 



poration was formed to acquire and 
operate the tea-room, the stock being 
taken by the college faculty and stu- 
dents. But the accommodations soon

shelter and a meal. Half an hour after 
arrival automobile parties are served 
with hot sirloin steak and French fried 
potatoes, or, if the party be largely 
made up of women, a ' ' five o'clock tea, ' ' 
which is more to their taste, is forth- 
coming. At the public table in the ar- 
tistic dining-room of the Inn, Women's 
Clubs, looking for an outing and "some- 
thing different to eat," find all the heart 
can desire. 

Miss Caroline W. Rogers, Wellesley, 
1900, and Miss Louise Just, University 
of Chicago, 1904, preside as hostesses, 
Miss Rogers being treasurer and finan- 
cier, and Miss Just dietician for the cor- 
poration, in which position she succeeds 
Miss Margaret Mackenzie, whose con- 
nection with the Inn since its start has 
been one of its pleasant features. 

What is now "The Inn" was at first 
opened as a "tea-room" by two gradu- 
ates of Wellesley. This venture proved 
so popular with the students that a cor- 



became inadequate even for a tea- 
room, and friends of the students 
could not be lodged nearer than Boston; 
and so, responding to the demand, the 
Tea-Room was transformed into an Inn 
with a capital of $20,000. The larger 
part of the new stock was taken 
by the faculty, undergraduates and 
alumna 1 of the college, and by business 
men of Boston and New York. 

The lower floor of the Inn is divided 
into two, practically separate parts. 
The one with entrance, dining and re- 
ception rooms is used exclusively as 
a home for students. The other in- 
cludes a tea-room and office combined 
and the public dining-room. Tran- 
sient guests and those who are not in 
attendance at the college are lodged 
in a commodious, homelike colonial 
house, called the "Outside Inn," adjoin- 
ing the Inn. 

Both dining-rooms are finished and 
furnished, Flemish style, in greenish-

A Good Tale ev 

of the Annisquam Yacht Club— great 
blazing logs of wood send out cheery 
light and genial warmth. Here it is 
that the ingle nook with its comfort- 
able Dutch settle has charms for the 
athletic girl, with skates over her arm, 
no less than for her bookish sister who 
stands high in the first third of her 
class. 

In a sketch published in a magazine 
devoted to culinary subjects the food 
served at this famous Inn ought cer- 
tainly to be given attention. Be- 
sides the three meals, prepared and 
served each day in the two dining- 
rooms, there is the five o'clock tea to 
be provided for an indefinite number 
of patrons. From two to six, fancy 
cakes, candy, sandwiches, and tea are 
on sale. At the regular English after- 
noon tea, fresh bread, toasted, marma- 
lade, a pot of tea and cakes are dispensed 
at 75 cents for two. Delicate china and 



rr the Tea Cups 

their own outfit. Griddle-cakes and 
coffee are often chosen at this hour, and 
the athletic girl quite frequently elects 
sandwiches made of brown bread with 
a filling of nuts and whipped cream. 
The Inn also caters for teas and spreads 
held at "society" houses and homes 
of the faculty. When the members 
of the Southern Club entertain, Man- 
land biscuit and Southern pancakes 
are in demand. The students of Ger- 
man ancestry ask for typical German 
spreads. When coaches and heads of 
sporting clubs meet to talk over athletic 
affairs, a dinner must be provided ; and 
after basket ball and hockey the teams 
are entertained by their respective 
captains. Birthday spreads and Sun- 
day night teas or luncheons are, also, 
common occasions when the good 
offices of the Inn are called into requisi- 
tion. 

The menus for these varied functions 



Innovations at Bn

are worked out, as far as possible, to agement to buy, in every line, the best 



meet the tastes of the patrons. But 
while, on these occasions, an attempt is 
put forth to secure novel and unique 
dishes, everything is made to conform 
to the canons of good taste and pro- 
priety. 

In supplies, it is the aim of the man- 



the market affords; and the fact that 
the investment paid, the first year, four 
per cent, and, the second year, seven 
per cent, on its working capital, is 
largely due to the hard work and pains- 
taking attention to details given by 
the management. 



Innovations at Bryn Mawr 

By Julia Davis Chandler 



THE fair collegi- 
ans at Bryn Mawr 
are selling gro- 
ceries in a salesroom of 
the college, in order to 
raise money for the Stu- 
dents' Building Fund. 
With this it is intended 
to erect a much-needed, 
large assembly room and 
apartments for visiting 
alumnae and others. 

If a public school in 
Philadelphia can buy a 
piano, with the proceeds 
from the sale of pretzels 
to the pupils at recess, 
why should not a noted college be suc- 
cessful in a larger attempt ? The village 
grocers are lamenting the lost patronage 
of hundreds of girls, who heretofore 
have given them their orders for extras, 
with which to supplement a generous 
table for informal teas or larger affairs. 

The college grocery, just established, 
is in the basement of the stately new 
hall of residence, for which Mr. Rocke- 
feller gave so handsomely, and which 
is named for him. On Rockefeller Hall 
the chosen bird of the college, the owl, 
sacred to Minerva, is carved. 

Minerva was a practical goddess, and 



Entrance to Rockefeller Hall 

gave to the Athenians the olive; and 
now these handmaidens of hers are 
selling olives — so dear to all girls — and 
many other things conducive to happi- 
ness, as apples, oranges, grapes, lemons, 
nuts, and raisins, also, for beverages, 
cocoa, tea, coffee, cider, grape juice, 
and lime juice, together with crackers 
and ginger cakes, sardines, and cheese, 
— the kind needed for perfect Welsh 
rabbits. Of course there are pickles 
and jams and jellies, the latter hung 
with gayly pictured placards, "Try it, 
Delicious and Nutritious." The cater- 
ing department takes orders for sand-

Corner of Grocery in Rockefeller Hall 

wiches, and arranges plates of maca- 
roons, lady fingers, and fancy cakes on 
demand. Also it takes orders for other 
dishes, milk, and cream, and sends out 
china for entertainments. The time of 



service is short, and there are so many 
students — since all classes share in the 
work — that not more than one day a 
year does any girl have to turn grocer. 
During the brief afternoon hours they 
sometimes take in twenty-five dollars. 

Fudge is the favorite candy: hence 
butter is in constant demand. The 
village grocers have long been used to 
having five-cent pats of butter, duly 
wrapped in paraffine paper, always 
ready for this purpose. Boxes of the 
finest candy from Philadelphia are also 
on sale, and fancy chocolates in all forms 

Since the* disastrous fire at the college, 
which destroyed one of the large dor- 
mitories, Denbigh Hall, there have 
been extra precautions taken against 
chafing-dishes, alcohol stoves, and 
lamps. But, in order not to withdraw 
the privilege of the refreshing and soci- 
able five o'clock cup of tea, and more 
substantial gastronomic indulgences, it 
has been arranged that, while spreads 
may still be served in the rooms, no 
heating of anything can be done there. 
"Tea- pantries," as they are called, are 



Innovations at Bryn Mawr

on every corridor of the several resi- 
dence halls that cluster on part of the 
great campus of fifty-two acres. In 
Rockefeller Hall several are on each 
long corridor, so that there is no crowd- 
ing; and all a student has to do is to 
step into one of these well-planned and 
carefully outfitted little pantries, to pre- 
pare a dainty dish. The tables, built 
to the wall, are metal-covered, and the 
utensils and kettles are of aluminum. 
Late in the afternoon, when lectures are 
over, the maids in attendance keep the 
kettles boiling, ready for tea. Fresh- 
men are supposed to use cocoa only. 

A home feeling is thus given, and yet 
the necessary decision is enforced that 
no extras can be carried into the dining- 
room. 

For occasions, other than the May-day 
f £tes or Class Day, when spring flowers 
or the massive daisy chains alone are 
used, there are plants on sale at the 
greenhouse department that adjoins the 
grocery store. Here are palms and 
similar favorites, and orders are taken 
for roses and cut flowers for all func- 
tions and for gifts. 

Other innovations are managed by 
the college, and the proceeds go to it 
instead of to the Building Fund. One 
is the new non-residents' lunch-room, 
which is greatly appreciated. It is 
under the care of a non-resident stu- 
dent, and waited on by a colored maid. 
Tickets are obtained at the bursar's 
office for very reasonable prices, and 
the menu is varied, — soup, fish, chops, 
milk, eggs, sandwiches, and fruit, be- 
sides whatever hot dishes are prepared 
for the main dining-room. These hot 
dishes are sent by dumb waiter from 
the main kitchen of Rockefeller Hall, 
where this lunch-room is situated, near 
the grocery. 

Other departments of recent or- 
ganization are for a dressmaker and 
her assistant, who have plenty of work 
in making and repairing frocks, re- 



binding skirts, etc., and in supplying 
the ever-needed shirt-waist. Laundry 
they look over and repair, charging by 
the hour for this work. 

A hair-dresser, wife of one of the em- 
ployees on the grounds, who has long 
been a favorite, is now installed in a 
room with all needed fittings for the 
work, and attends to shampooing and 
manicuring. 

Then there is a salesroom, where 
negatives are taken to be developed and 
photographs of the college are sold, also 
song books and calendars, designed by 
noted illustrators and depicting college 
life throughout the year. 

Churches have long had oyster sup- 
pers and strawberry festivals, and in 
Pennsylvania F'asnacht cake sales are 
held on Shrove Tuesday. Society 
women start English tea-rooms; and, 
since the fire, Baltimore's most exclu- 
sive and wealthy women are managing 
cafes and restaurants, where the best 
of Southern fare can be had. If the 
colleges are also to go into food work, 
as Bryn Mawr has, for revenue, they 
will soon be issuing recipe books, as 
the churches have for years, or putting 
forth scientific treatises on food and 
diet, as instructors of schools of do- 
mestic science are now doing. When 
that time comes, there will be the final 
court of appeal, — to women, at least, 
who love their Alma Mater. 

College life, with its freedom, self- 
government, and generously supplied 
table, is so vastly different from the 
boarding-school espionage and scant 
fare of a generation ago, that it is 
most interesting to see these Bryn Mawr 
girls, with their heads crammed with 
classics and "poli-con," allowed to in- 
dulge in domestic pleasures, in their 
luxuriously appointed rooms, also with 
so much spirit go into practical busi- 
ness, and sell groceries, not only for 
their own convenience, but to raise 
money for the college. 



"The Art of Living Long" and "The 

X, Y, Z, of Nutrition" 

By Eliza Stowe Twitchell 



EMERSON, in describing the spir- 
itual unrest of his time, declared 
that it seemed as if "all the world 
were out hunting for a religion." Of 
the material unrest at the present day 
it may be said that all the world are out 
hunting for a refcipe to prolong life. 

The "elixir of life" and the "philos- 
opher's stone* ' are no longer sought for 
directly, since the science of chemistry 
has destroyed our faith in mystical com- 
binations; yet, since it is natural for 
man to have faith in something, he has 
transformed his blind belief in the oc- 
cult to a firm reliance upon everything 
that claims to be scientific; as wit- 
ness our faith in the rejuvenating 
powers of certain remedies and food 
combinations that are offered to the 
public as the latest utterances of 
science, such as the blue-glass craze, the 
morning-dew toilet, X-ray vibrations, 
no breakfast fad, as well as the vari- 
ous kinds of cereal foods and coffees 
now on the market, each claiming its 
own superiority over all competitors for 
sustaining life and increasing vitality. 

The "philosopher's stone" is no lon- 
ger sought for in the transmutation of 
metals, but within the feverish and ex- 
citing babel of the stock exchange. 
The rise of some to sudden wealth by 
speculation, by grasping the power to 
control the markets of the world, has 
tempted many to venture upon un- 
known seas, where they hope to find 
some transforming agency, like the an- 
cient philosopher's stone, in modern 
gold bricks. 

The rush and riot of modern life may 
soon reach its culmination; for this un- 
rest is even now giving place to earnest 
seeking after health in periods of relax- 



ation, in a quiet perusal of " The Simple 
Life," with the result still uncertain. 

The rapid march of science has 
stamped its mark upon every depart- 
ment of the age; and the tide is surely 
turning in favor of a more rational and 
more scientific method of living. This 
fact is seen not only in our unproved 
methods of cooking, but in the general 
care of the health. We no longer wait till 
we are at death's door before we send 
for the doctor; but more often save him 
the trouble of coming at all by our daily 
devotions to some scientific system of 
physical culture and hygienic living. 

Pew things mark the sane and health- 
ful spirit of the age better than the pub- 
lication and sale of two recent books, 
"The Art of Living Long," by Count 
Carnaro, and "The X, Y, Z, of Nutri- 
tion," by Horace Fletcher. 

The first consists, in part, of a new 
translation and republication of the 
writings of that famous Italian cen- 
tenarian, giving his recipe for the "Art 
of Living Long." This recipe is, indeed, 
easy and simple enough for any one to 
try, though it might be found exceed- 
ingly hard to follow. It consists in 
nothing more difficult than in limiting 
one's daily allowance of food to the 
smallest amount that will satisfy hun- 
ger and fully sustain the vital forces, 
and of this quantity each individual 
must be his own best judge. But, since 
such extreme temperance is more eas- 
ily described than followed, it required 
a large volume of argument and ex- 
hortation to set the importance of the 
matter in its true light. 

At what would be considered extreme 
old age, Count Carnaro set himself the 
task of telling the world the joys and 



u 



The Art of Living Long" 



389 



blessings of a simple and temperate 
life, as he had found it since the age of 
forty-five ! 

Before that time he had lived to en- 
joy the pleasures of the appetites, and 
had gained as a result only ill-health 
and misery. At forty-five, beholding 
the untimely approach of old age creep- 
ing on, he set himself the task of chang- 
ing his habits of life. 

From henceforth he ate to live, and 
not to enjoy; yet the enjoyments, which 
soon followed, were far greater than any 
he had previously known, increasing 
with his advancing years. 

In four charming essays, written at 
the ages of eighty-three, eighty-six, 
ninety-one, and ninety-five, he describes 
in full his manner of living and its re- 
sults, — a clear mind, capable of reflec- 
tion, accompanied with a serene spirit- 
ual uplift, in which he passed his days 
and nights, "the most beautiful of his 
life." 

At eighty-six he writes, "Although 
my constitution was naturally so 
wretched that it seemed impossible I 
should live beyond the age of forty, 
whereas I am now in my eighty-sixth 
year, full of health and strength." 

At ninety-one he writes, "All man- 
kind may possess an earthly paradise 
after the age of eighty, — a paradise with 
which I myself am blessed." 

And at ninety-five he adds: "I al- 
ways eat with relish, my sleep is sweet 
and peaceful, and, moreover, all my 
faculties are in a condition as perfect 
as ever they were. My mind is more 
than ever keen and clear, my judg- 
ment sound, my memory tenacious. 
My heart is full of life; and my voice — 
that which is wont to be the first thing 
in man to fail — is strong and sonorous." 

The secret of this he attributed 
wholly to his extreme temperance in 
eating. So careful was he not to over- 
eat, by so much as one mouthful, that 
he always weighed his food, and partook 
of the same small allowance daily. 



After the body has reached its full 
growth, it requires only sufficient 
nourishment to keep the acquired 
vitality in running order; and this 
amount is, no doubt, much less than is 
usually supposed. 

. Count Carnaro passed out of this 
life at the extreme old age of one 
hundred and three, without sickness, 
pain, or suffering. His spirit could 
never grow old, but gradually became 
ready for a world of more spiritual 
conditions. 

How timely after this book comes 
that of Horace Fletcher, "The X, Y, Z, 
of Nutrition," just when the currents 
of advanced thought seem to be tending 
in the direction of the higher life by 
way of physical improvement! 

In a book published some years ago 
Horace Fletcher told the world how it 
was possible for every one to live with- 
out anger or worry. In this book he 
tells of his discovery of the most 
rational and scientific manner of eat- 
ing, together with its results, as prac- 
tised by himself for a series of years, 
all of which are quite in harmony with 
the teachings of Count Canaro. In- 
deed, they 1 but strengthen and supple- 
ment his helpful example. 

Mr. Fletcher's advice, in brief, is 
this: to partake of all food by small 
mouthfuls, and masticate each one so 
completely that all will be reduced to 
a cream before swallowing. Since taste 
resides in the mouth and not in the 
stomach, here is a hint from nature 
that has never before been fully worked 
out. 

When food is retained in the mouth 
until all taste has been abstracted, not 
only is its flavor found to be more en- 
joyable and satisf ying, but the chemical 
changes thus produced upon it by the 
action of the saliva have fitted it for 
easy digestion and assimilation. For 
instance, starch and sugar (neither of 
which is digested in the stomach) are 
rapidly changed by the saliva of the 



390 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



mouth into pre-digested substances, 
which can then be readily digested. 

So this rule of slow eating is univer- 
sally applied to all food, liquids as well 
as solids, except water, which is taste- 
less. This rule so far outdoes the Glad- 
stone method, and it is considered so 
important, that a new word has been 
coined to characterize it. It is called 
"fletcherizing" the food. 

By making a strong resolution to 
follow this method, a habit is soon ac- 
quired, and we have Mr. Fletcher's 
word for it that nothing tends so surely 
and so quickly to rejuvenate the whole 
man as this simple yet sovereign 
remedy. 

To specialize its merits: First, there 
is no possible chance of over-eating. 
Second, the appetite is satisfied with 
far less food than when nutriment is 
partaken in the usual manner; because, 
it being so easily digested and as- 
similated, there is very little waste. 
Third, even the plainest of food has 
such a delicious flavor, there is soon 
developed a more refined pleasure in 
eating. Fourth, when the initial 
process of digestion is changed, all 
that follows is likewise changed, and/ 
as a general result from this, all the 
tissues of the body become filled with 



new life and freshness. These in turn 
produce a beneficial effect upon the 
brain, reacting upon the mind and emo- 
tions, even freeing the very self from 
its too conscious weight of materiality. 
Indeed, all who have tried this method 
of eating testify to great buoyancy of 
spirit and a strength of emotion little 
dreamed of by those who have not the 
self-control to submit themselves to 
this so rigid discipline. 

Mr. Fletcher made several careful 
experiments, to test his bodily strength 
and endurance, as well as the vigor of 
his mind, when limiting himself to a 
small allowance of food partaken of in 
this manner, and, in every case, the result 
was most satisfactory and successful. 

This new "fad," if so it may be 
called, has already many noted fol- 
lowers, and even its social clubs, 
where suppers are "fletcherized," to the 
delight and satisfaction of all. 

There seems to be only one thing 
that can be said against it. Should it 
come at once into general use, it would 
tend to pauperize the patent medicine 
industry. But, inasmuch as self -disci- 
pline appeals only to the comparatively 
few who are capable of such restraint, 
this industry seems likely to continue 
for a long time to come. 



Impatience 

By Grace Stone Field 



Harkl I hear a bluebird singing: 

Spring is almost here. 
AU the birds are northward winging, 
And a single snowdrop springing 

Makes its meaning clear. 



Yesterday I saw a robin 

Crimson 'gainst the sky; 
But to-day the North Wind, sobbing. 

Whispers, "By and by." 



Oh, it's weary, weary waiting 1 

Bluebird, robin, dear, 
Why begin this idle prating, 
Song of spring and talk of mating, 

When it's winter here? 



Breakfast at Begue's 

By Mrs. F. A. McCormick 



I 



am very proud to testify: 
The happiest of my days 
Is March i ith, '95, 
At breakfast at Begu6's. 
Eugene Field, in the Begui Register. 



AND their name is legion who 

ZJm have been similarly inspired 
JL JL by the good things the Madame 
prepares and serves. . 

To begin properly, the Maison de 
Begu6 is located in New Orleans, 
La., on the corner of Decatur and 
Madison Streets, directly opposite the 
French market, and, in New England 
parlance, is "no great shakes for looks." 
In fact, looks are not its strong point. 
New Orleans has not abandoned the 
system of surface sewerage, and at this 
corner it is to be seen in all its glory. 
Also there is mud, New Orleans mud, 
the like of which is not to be found in 
any other community.. It is venerable 
and gray, and tenacious and deep, and 
slimy and many other things. It would 
not be surprising if it were the identi- 
cal mud that greeted Governor Caron- 
deiet on his arrival from Spain a cen- 
tury and a half ago, for the Maison 
de Begu6 is also near the levee where 
his Excellency first set foot in I,ouisi- 
ana. 

Two stories and one-half high is the 
building, with a ' 'gallery* ' on two sides, 
and there has been and is a marked 
scarcity of paint thereabouts. On the 
street floor, except for two hours and 
one-half each day, Monsieur holds forth 
behind the modest bar, no better and 
no worse than fifty other water-front 
bar-rooms in the city. There he enter- 
tains his old-time cronies from the mar- 
ket across the street, and, when there is 
a particularly fine turkey, a fine basket 
of fruit, or a fine arrival of any kind, 
they see that Monsieur hears of it early. 
Then, if it meets his critical require- 



ments, it is annexed, to appear at the 
famous eleven o'clock breakfast. 

The breakfast was originally pre- 
pared to meet the needs of the market 
people after their work was done for the 
day. But the Philistine from all over 
this broad land has descended upon 
Monsieur and Madame, and now the 
market people cannot find room in 
the diminutive dining-room, nor the 
Philistine, either, for that matter, un- 
less he engage his space at the table 
two or three days in advance. 

We arrived on a Tuesday morning, 
at 10.45, and, after a careful scrutiny of 
the dingy exterior, decided we did not 
want breakfast at Begums. We were 
sustained and soothed, however, by the 
many encomiums lavished on that 
breakfast, and finally, with a courage 
that must have partaken of the Old 
World battlefields, we entered the side 
door on Madison Street, climbed an ex- 
ceedingly muddy and steep stairway, 
and arrived on a landing, two by three 
feet, separated by a glass door from 
the dining-room. 

From that moment our troubles 
were at an end. The lone waiter 
ushered us to a place at the table with 
its snowy linen cover and napkins, 
bunches of the most wonderful celery 
and radishes, bottles of charged mineral 
water and good red wine, together with 
goblets from which to drink. You 
were privileged to drink # wine or water 
from the goblets, or wine and water, 
or water and wine, but, if you drank 
at all, you drank from these goblets. 
And they held a pint. Based on the 
size of the goblets, the bottles were 



39* 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



plentifully distributed down the centre 
of the table, and at almost any time dur- 
ing the meal, when he was not serving 
a course, the lone waiter, for no appar- 
ent reason, would jump as if he had 
been stung by a bee, and proceed to 
drop bottles of wine wherever he could 
find space on the table. The com- 
munistic idea prevailed in placing and 
emptying the bottles. No one had a 
whole bottle of his own, but helped 
himself from the two to four different 
bottles in front of him, in common with 
his neighbors on the opposite side of the 
table and those on his left and right 
hand. This was a delightful scheme 
for the drinker with a conscience, for 
he lost all idea of how much liquid he 
had consumed, and had, therefore, 
nothyig with which to reproach him- 
self. 

There were but three persons seated 
at the table when we arrived, but soon 
the footfall of a mighty host was 
heard on the stair. The waiter raised 
his voice in a vigorous appeal for Mon- 
sieur. Monsieur arrived at once, and, 
like the great Napoleon, his presence 
produced order out of chaos. "Had 
the party engaged seats ?" "No." 
"Well, I should like very much to ac- 
commodate, but every seat is taken." 
"Seven in the party! Oh, that is a 
great many. Now, if there were one 
or two, perhaps some means might be 
found." "No, there is not room to- 
morrow for such a party; yes, the next 
day, if you wish. It is too bad you go 
out of town before; but what would 
you?" An extremely French shrug 
of the shoulders, a most polite bow, 
and seven hungry and disappointed 
ladies and gentlemen were on the side- 
walk. 

By eleven q'clock the eighteen seats 
about the table were occupied, and 
with a whistle suggestive of a boatswain 
piping all hands on deck the first course 
was served. There were no menu 
cards, but the courses were: — 



Crawfish, Boiled. 
Pried Calves' Liver, Green Peppers. 
Fried Spanish Mackerel, Olives. 
Fillet of Beef a la Creole. 
Roast Creole Turkey, Stuffed with Truffles. 
Endive Salad with a Suggestion of Garlic 
Fried Egg Plant. Guava Paste. 
Camembert Cheese. Red Apples. 
Cafe* Noir with Cognac. 
Hard Crackers. 

It was our first introduction to craw- 
fish, and, being law-abiding individuals 
when at home, it was some few moments 
before we could bring ourselves to eat 
what seemed short lobsters. The 
longest of them could not have been 
more than three inches. But they 
were good, the whole breakfast was 
good, and the breakfasters were all 
jolly good fellows. Effie Shannon has 
written in the famous register, "Is not 
this an awfully jolly party?" and jollity 
seemed the keynote of this occasion. 
Every one had a good time from the 
moment of sitting down to the folding 
of the napkin, and there was no room 
for conventionality. 

Madame has, up to a short time, 
done all the cooking herself, but rheu- 
matism has recently laid a heavy hand 
upon her, so now she can do no more 
than oversee the preparation of the 
various courses. She hobbles about 
the table on her crutches, joking first 
with this one, then with that, and tell- 
ing how she enjoys visiting with her big 
family and how she appreciates their 
words of praise. Then, just as we are 
about to rise from the table, she tells 
about her book of recipes of old Creole 
cooking. Every one wants a copy, and 
also one of the souvenir spoons. For a 
time it looks as if the poor old lady 
would be mobbed, but she emerges un- 
scathed, and it is a merry party that 
issues from the doorway, no longer 
dingy and untidy, but glorified with the 
memory of a feast, the like of which we 
may never again hope to enjoy. 

The Madame does all her cooking on 
an ordinary gas stove, four burners on

top and an oven of ordinary size, with 
a broiler underneath. For the fried 
dishes she uses, a great pot filled with 
a fluid poured from a five-gallon can, 
marked, "Finest Cotton Seed Oil." 
May I never eat anything worse than 
her fried dishes! 

We bought one of the Recipe Books, 
but, after trying with diligence to get 



even the baked potatoes to taste like 
Madame's, the great thought occurred 
to us that our efforts to produce Creole 
cookery in Massachusetts were like 
unto the Westerner's, who labored 
futilely with the baked-bean | problem, 
and was finally told, with a great show 
of sincerity, that, "to get 'em just right, 
you've got to get the east wind in 'em." 



The Dignity of Cook 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



A T the foot of Mount Salvatore, 
/\ in the city of Lugano, Switzer- 
X m land, there is a snug little hotel, 
which was presided over some years 
ago by a German, Herr and his ex- 
cellent wife, who did the cooking for 
the establishment. As their guests 
were numerous throughout the year, it 
was necessary to keep several assist- 
ants, and various departments of work 
were given up to them ; but, during an 
acquaintance of a good many weeks 

with Frau , I never knew her for a 

single meal to relinquish her place as 
cook. She was not chief cook, but cook. 
She prepared all the food that went on 
the table ; and, since she esteemed her 
work the most important about the 
house, she had no thought of leaving it 
to uninterested or unskilled persons. 

Being an American, and not a thor- 
oughly enlightened one at that, I 

scarcely understood Frau ; for it 

was obvious that she was a woman of 
the highest refinement, and that it was 
not necessity which effected her devo- 
tion to the cook stove. I had seen 
many of my countrywomen with whom 
cooking was a fad. They made some 
fancy thing, now and then, when it 
suited their convenience, and they 
talked occasionally of being able to 



make good bread, but they wisely gave 
their families no opportunity to dis- 
prove the statement. Here, however, 
was another type of woman, — one who 
chose to follow the art of which she 
was a patron. She was a real cook, 
the first one I had ever known. 

Let those who remained with her 
several weeks testify as to the value of 
her work. Alas! very few can compre- 
hend what it means, when I say that 
her guests were a well-fed company. 
All the food which she handled seemed 
to show its full nourishing power; and 
this beef, this fish, these vegetables, 
this pudding, — why should each article 
be the best of its kind we had ever 
eaten? Besides good quality of pro- 
visions and good cooking, we had great 
variety. This refers not only to pre- 
pared dishes, but to uncooked fruits; 
for Frau did not try to improve upon 
Nature's finest products. 

The bread that was served us was 
par excellence; the salads were always 
good, and never mysterious save in 
goodness. Sometimes, when our family 
was small, Frau humored us by mixing 
the salad at table, and we saw that the 
process, though simple, was exact, and 
that the excellence of the dish was not 
due entirely to superior olive oil.

If we inquired of her methods of pre- 
paring any special food, our hostess was 
happy and explicit in giving directions. 
Her very directness and care showed 
her power of intellect and her forceful 
character. One reason she was so good 
a cook was that she had so good a head. 
Her work had permitted the exercise of 
the highest talent, and it had aug- 
mented the talent. All her mental 
operations felt the effect of this drill 
which her mind had undergone in man- 
aging the culinary. Clear thinking had 
led to efficient action ; clear thinking and 
efficient action had strengthened the 
nobility of the soul. Thus hand, head, 
and heart had been mutually helpful. 

Everything was done calmly and in 
order, and there was never any reason 
for exhaustion or embarrasment in the 
kitchen. The meals were not acci- 
dentally good or bad, but uniformly 
satisfactory. Frau knew two or three 
days ahead of time what she should pre- 
pare for regular guests, and she had to 
be constantly ready for unannounced 
persons, sometimes to the number of 
twenty or more. 

But the incredible part of it all re- 



mains to be told : Frau was not a drudge, 
— she enjoyed her work too much for 
that, — and she was not a slave. She 
did not attempt to do everything. In 
fact, there were many bits of work 
quite beneath her dignity. One day, 
when she was in my room, she acci- 
dentally tipped over a vase of flowers. 
I started to pick them up, but she de- 
terred me. Neither did she do it her- 
self, but rang for a maid. This seemed 
to my American mind very strange, in 
view of her arduous labors in the kitchen. 
I have ceased to think it either pe- 
culiar or humorous, for certainly her 
"arduous labors in the kitchen" en- 
titled her to exemption from other 
duties. 

Since discovering this woman on the 
other side of the Atlantic, I have been 
interested in searching for her equal at 
home, and I am glad to say I have 
not looked in vain. Good cooks are 
being produced in America. We are 
beginning to know what it means to be 
nourished. Half our headaches and 
inefficiency have vanished, and from 
the depths of our hearts we are crying 
to our benefactors, "All hail!" 



There are no Birds in Last Year's Nest 

By Helen Knight Wyman 



"No birds in last year's nest!" you say? 

Ah, no! 
For they have flown away, away, 

From frost and snow. 
In other lands they gayly sing, 
Where winter is replaced by spring 

And roses blow. 

Yet are we happier for their song, — 

Ah, yes! 
Although their stay could not be long, 

They came to bless! 
E'en though the nest is empty now, 
Hung on the mossy apple-bough 

With carefulness! 



So, though the dear ones whom we loved 

Are fled, 
They live within that land above, — 

They are not dead! 
They needs must leave this world of woe; 
But, where perpetual roses blow, 

They sing instead. 

Their coming gave us far more bliss 

Than pain; 
And, though their voices do we miss 

And seek in vain, 
We know that those whose love is ours 
Await us, — in those heavenly bowers 

We'll meet again I 



The Coming of «Tilleul" 

By Helen Campbell 



cc 




T sounds like 'The Coming of 
Arthur' or some other Tennyson- 
ian thing, but appears to be a 
prophecy. Wait a little, for it is a 
rather long story, it seems." And now 
the speaker's pretty head bent again 
over the closely written pages of a for- 
eign letter with the Paris postmark, her 
guest, as she saw her absorption, ris- 
ing presently and moving quietly up 
and down the big library. 

"Don't mind me," she said, as her 
friend looked up for a moment and then 
laid the letter on the table. 

"But I do mind. You look utterly 
exhausted." 

"That is maya, pure illusion. I am 
only nervous as a witch after that suc- 
cession of cups of tea. These New 
York women have Anglicised them- 
selves to that degree that very soon they 
will be calling for tea before they are 
out of bed. I had to swear off 'in Lon- 
don, though the abominable climate is 
really the excuse, for it compels one to 
get warm on tea, since there are no real 
fires, only a suggestion of coal in a little 
grate for even as big a room as this, 
as you know to your sorrow; for their 
methods gave you rheumatism just 
like their own, for they all have it. 
But I confess to utter amazement at 
the amount one is compelled to take 
here. Why must one, when we have 
had a comfortable, perhaps too com- 
fortable lunch, be forced to encompass 
tea and multitudinous sandwiches and 
little cakes at perhaps half a dozen teas 
in an afternoon?" 

"But, my dear, you don't have to 
take it." 

"Practically, you do. There's really 
nothing else to do; for you wouldn't 
have me shake hands and leave, would 
you? A tea doesn't include conversa- 



tion, as you know. The hostess is in 
a hurry to pass you on and greet the 
next one, and, just as a means of longer 
observation, you take the tea and eat 
the cake and look at the gowns and 
listen to that queer blending of voices, 
like the sound of the sea, at last. It 
hypnotizes me, and then I take more 
tea and stagger on to the next saloon, 
so to speak. You can drop one of the 
o's, if you are shocked. What I want is 
abolition, prohibition, or whatever you 
like to call it. It is high time, and this 
business of the simple life ought to do 
something in that direction. It is 
most singular that anything simple 
should come from the French." 

"On the contrary, it rims in the blood. 
Have you forgotten Rousseau and his 
preaching? Wagner is only another 
phase of much the same thing. But 
the antidote you need, that we all do, 
indeed, is in my lap. It is tilleul." 

"Tilleul means nothing to me but a 
linden-tree. Unlet den Linden would 
mean afternoon coffee, instead of tea, 
and much the same effect. But I will 
sit down again, and wait till you disen- 
tangle whatever I am to be taught from 
the longest letter I have ever seen. I 
did not know that this generation held 
anybody who could cover so many 
pages." 

"There is not one too many, for it 
tells me how the simple life has come 
to Paris, not to the clothes as yet, but 
to the wearers. For the Parisians had 
sought also to be English, here and there, 
and drunk tea till they had no digestion 
left, and nervous attacks were the order 
of the day for all of them. I was there 
when everybody was taking five o'clock 
tea at Paris bars. You know yourself 
they are really much more like delightful 
parlors than bars, for they had soft,

brilliant carpets, flowers everywhere, 
and palms and so on in nooks, with 
charming little tables and egg-shell 
china for the five o'clock tea. But be- 
fore that ces dames had simply revelled 
in the high bar chairs, because they were 
a novelty, and, revolving, and one could 
show the whole costume to extraordi- 
nary advantage. Let me read you what 
has come of it: — 

" 'All that singular burst of freedom 
summed up in tea at the bars is over. 
Every hdtel and cafe has its tea-room 
now, but tea no longer, since French 
physicians insist it is the cause, in part 
certainly, of neurasthenia, which all 
dread. It is tilleul they drink. Not at 
all the old form, the "quatre fleurs," 
smelling like new-mown hay and tasting 
abominably, nor the large-leafed til- 
leul, but the genuine silvered tilleul, 
the Hungarian lime, or linden, young 
leaves and blossoms, dried and treated 
like tea, the infusion made with freshly 
boiled water. It looks precisely like 
tea with little blossoms intermixed. 
To the " quatre fleurs" and the large- 
leaved tilleul they added orange-flower 
water, and made a mess much worse 
than our grandmothers' herb teas. But 
tilleul is as innocent as catnip, wouldn't 
harm a baby. It is also, so authori- 
ties say, calming, anti-spasmodic, and 
sudorific, or sweating, all of which is 
good for the excitable Parisian. The 
singular fact is that men and women 
alike order it, and, also, that excessive 
wine-drinking has gone out, save for 
here and there an old-fashioned Pari- 
sian diner or some foreigner. A Rus- 
sian will take three or four bottles. 
No tilleul for him. But the Parisian 
orders now glasses of milk, and for 
meat most often cold chicken, gar- 
nished with cubes of very concentrated 
meat jelly, beef perhaps or the essence 
of an entire chicken garnishing a slice 
or two. 

" 'Of course there are still hot suppers 
and famous dinners, but it is the for- 



eigner who eats them. Champagne 
corks still pop for him and for the few 
stray Frenchmen, but women appear 
to have dropped wine-drinking almost 
entirely, because of the new diseases, or 
old ones under the new names, of gas- 
tritis and neurasthenia. In other words, 
these maladies have brought about con- 
version, it would seem, and the choicest 
productions of the French chef are 
eaten by other nationalities, — the Rus- 
sian most greedily, he, too, drinking 
profusely, one of them the other day 
taking what is known as a "double 
Jeroboam," though why I know not, 
but it holds eight bottles. The Ameri- 
cans follow as drinkers who understand 
their wines, the Belgians next, then the 
Germans and the South Americans, 
especially the Chileans. These facts 
are not of my gleaning, but imparted 
to me by our old friend, Monsieur Mail- 
lard, who watches each day, as if it were 
to hold a revelation. "Something is 
happening, but I know not what as yet, " 
he says. "A wave is passing over so- 
ciety, electric in its quality and trans- 
ferred as silently to all. People do not 
talk about it, but suddenly one sees 
them taking on new methods. It is 
the women who lead in it, and with us 
our women are the real rulers of so- 
ciety. When they adopt tilleul, one 
may be sure a miracle has begun; and 
who knows what may follow?'"" 

The reader folded the letter, and 
looked at her friend, who had sprung 
up again. 

"What a joke it would be, if we 
should serve tilleul to-morrow," she 
said, ' 'at your own five o'clock ! Do you 
suppose we could find any at some good 
druggist's? It ought to be perfectly 
fresh, of course." 

"Wait till Annie herself is here," 
her friend returned. "She is coming 
home for a little while, perhaps even 
to stay, and the next steamer will bring 
her. And she tells me in this she 
will bring a packet of tilleul, and in-

augurate the new regime. In the mean 
time, you can explore, if you like, and, 
if you find the real thing, we will ex- 
periment on our own account. You 
may be certain that a thing all Paris is 



drinking will not linger long on the way 
to us, but I would like to be first. 
That's nonsense, though. Annie will 
know exactly how it should be prepared 
and served. We will wait for her." 



A Suggestive Course in Home Economics 

for Club Work 



By Grace A. Dean 



THE following course has been 
laid out to cover the club 
work in this department for 
one year or to be extended through the 
second season. The lectures should be 
given by experts sufficiently familiar 
with their subjects to present them in 
the most attractive manner. It is 
planned to have papers prepared and 
read by members, in the meetings com- 
ing between the lectures, on subjects 
closely related to the previous lecture. 
The papers should be concise, so as to 
allow time for free discussion after 
reading. It may be found advisable to 
change the arrangement, having only 
two papers presented at each meeting, 
so as to secure a more complete discus- 
sion of each subject. Sufficient time 
should elapse between lectures to allow 
for study and consideration of every 
side of this science.

Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 

By Mary D, Chambers 



Lesson V. Meats 



Broiled Steak, Sirloin or Porter- 
house. Method I. 

i. Trim off exposed edges, and re- 
move superfluous fat. Heat broiler, 
and grease lightly with a piece of fat 
on a fork. Place steak on broiler with 
skin edge toward handle. Open chim- 
ney damper and check of range, and 
hold steak close to the clear red coals, 
turning every ten seconds. When half 
the time allowed for cooking has ex- 
pired, reduce the temperature by hold- 
ing broiler higher, and turn as before 
until cooked. Serve on hot platter, 
garnished with cress and slices of lemon. 

Time for broiling. Steak one inch 
thick, rare, 4 m. ; medium, 6 m.; well- 
done, 8 m. Steak two inches thick, 
rare, 8 m. ; medium, 10 to 12 m. ; well 
done, 14 m. 

Note. — The thicker steak needs only one- 
quarter of the time, instead of one-half, at the 
initial high temperature. 

Broiled Steak. Method II. 

2. Pan-broiling, — Heat pan "blue" 
hot, and rub very lightly and quickly 
with suet, to keep meat from stick- 
ing. Turn meat constantly for first 
half of the time. Reduce temperature 
by extinguishing gas, putting on stove 
lid, or drawing pan to side of range, so 
that the meat is cooked chiefly by the 
retained heat, and turn only once dur- 
ing the latter half of the time. Serve 
as before. 

Note. — In pan-broiling about one-third more 
time should be allowed than in broiling over 
the open fire. 

Broiled Steak. Method III. 

(Steak previously marinated) 

3. A tough steak is rubbed with oil 



and vinegar mixed in the proportion of 
three parts vinegar to one of oil, and 
allowed to stand for several hours. Or 
it may be allowed to stand in a bath 
of oil and vinegar for several hours. 
The steak is then wiped dry, and 
broiled by Method I. 

4. A tough steak, previously frozen, 
broiled by either Method I. or II. 

5. A tough steak, previously pounded 
with wooden pestle, broiled or pan- 
broiled. 

6. Scraped Meat Balls. — Scrape pulp 
from steak with edge of knife. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and form 
into balls one inch in diameter. Cook 
by rolling in hot pan. Or the meat 
pulp can be formed into cakes, and 
broiled over coals. 

Note. — Allow one-third less time than in 
cooking steak either by broiling or pan-broiling. 

7. A piece of tough steak broiled by 
Method I., without any previous treat- 
ment. 

8. A piece of either kind of steak 
broiled by Method I., omitting the 
frequent turning. The steak is cooked 
for half the time on one side, for half 
on the other. 

9. A piece of tough steak pan- 
broiled, without reducing temperature 
during latter part of cooking. 

Accompaniments to Steak 

Horseradish Sauce 

Mix equal parts of grated horse- 
radish and fine bread crumbs. Season 
slightly with salt and pepper. Moisten 
with cream, and heat through on hot 
pan. 

Broiled Bananas 

Peel bananas, and cut in quarters,

first across, and then lengthwise. Broil 
or saut£ in butter until soft. 

Arrangement of Work 

In conducting this Lesson, No. i was 
taken as the type of a good broiled 
steak, the others were endeavors to 
approximate this type under the limi- 
tations imposed by an inferior cut or 
a less suitable method of applying heat. 
No. 6 is introduced here simply to show 
the effect of the connective tissue both 
as a non-conductor and as a toughen- 
ing agent. 

Each student is expected to per- 
form two of the indicated steps, and is 
held responsible, at the recitation, for 
careful observation and thoughtful in- 
ference. The following has been found 
a good grouping of the various steps 
in assigning the work. Nos. 4 and 7, 
Nos. 5 and 7, Nos. 3 and 7, Nos 2 and 
6, Nos. 2 and 9, Nos. 1 or 2 and 8. 

About two ounces of steak will be 
found sufficient for each process, with 
the exception of No. 1, which had 
better be demonstrated in fairly large 
quantity either by the instructor or 
some capable member of the class. 

In every case the steak, or portion 
of steak, is weighed before and after 
cooking. 

The individual problem for the stu- 
dent is to plan and arrange the work so 
that everything shall be hot and ready 
to serve at once. 

Corroborative Experiments 

1. Long section and cross section of 
steak examined under microscope. 

2. Meat tested with red and blue 
litmus. 

3. A cube of meat immersed in 
beaker of boiling water, and allowed 
to boil several minutes. 

4. Meat scraped with edge of knife. 
Pulp, one to two spoonfuls, mixed with 
cold water in glass, and then allowed to 
settle. 



5. Fibres from 4 treated with HC1. 
Allowed to stand 20 to 30 m. 

6. Water from 4 strained through 
cheese-cloth. Pulp squeezed. Water 
and pulp both tasted. 

7. Water allowed to heat slowly, 
without stirring, until no further change 
occurs. Filter. Taste filtrate and 
residue. 

8. Pulp from 6 heated and tasted. 

9. Meat juice expressed by means of 
press, and acid added. 

10. Dry the pulp from 8 and the 
residue from 7, and weigh. 

Questions 

Account for the loss of weight in cook- 
ing meat, (3 reasons.) In which kind 
of meat, tough or tender, was the loss 
the greater? Why? 

What makes meat tough? From 
what part of the animal would you 
expect the tender joints and steaks? 

Why are steaks always cut across 
the direction of the muscle fibres? 
(3 reasons.) 

Why in some cases was a shorter, 
in others a longer, time allowed for the 
cooking of the steaks to-day? 

When the broiler is raised three 
inches from the coals, how much is the 
heat reduced ? 

Compare the cooking of eggs (see 
page 194), Nos. 2 and 4, with the broil- 
ing of steak, Nos. 1 and 8. 

Why do we cook tender meat ? Why 
do we cook tough meat ? 
; Compare the economy in serving 
eggs at 30 cents per dozen with the 
serving of beef at 16 cents per pound.

MRS. JANET M. HILL, ed- 
itor of the Cooking-School 
Magazine from its first issue, 
writes the menus for social occasions 
and other functions in many of the 
best homes in all parts of the land. 
To write menus that fulfil the condi- 
tions, aesthetic and hygienic, of the 
present day requires no inconsiderable 
expenditure of thought, time, and 
energy. The modern menu must be 
complete, harmoniously composed, and 
approximately faultless in every re- 
spect. It must, also, be adapted to the 
occasion and the hour. This work 
calls for professional skill and large 
experience. 
Mrs. Hill's book, "Practical Cooking 



and Serving," has now come to be re- 
garded as the most complete and satis- 
factory work of the kind, — a standard 
authority on the culinary art. Wher- 
ever it is known and used, it receives 
the highest commendation and praise. 



HANDCRAFT 

IN her chat about the hand in a re- 
cent number of the Century Mag- 
azine, Helen Keller not only re- 
veals to us anew her own marvelous 
gifts and attainments, but at the 
same time she adds emphasis to the 
rare usefulness and cunning of the hand. 

To Helen Keller the hand is what 
hearing and sight together are to 
others. What she has attained, under 
wise guidance, through the sense of 
touch alone is one of the marvels of 
an eventful age. For, as she says, by 
touch paradise has been veritably 
gained by her. 

Incidentally, by her wonderful pur- 
suit of knowledge, the hand also 
has gained a distinction that can- 
not be despised. Indeed, we may not 
say that the work of man's hand has 
ever been really despised; but, else 
we are mistaken, to work with the 
hands for a living has not always and 
everywhere been free from the stigma 
of disgrace. To-day, however, the 
skilful hand is the most important 
factor in the economy of life. The 
test of educational attainment is not 
so much what one knows as what one 
can do. The supreme question is (and 
sooner or later every one must ask it), 
Can I earn a living? 

Much of the so-called knowledge ac- 
quired from books is untrue, still more 
has become obsolete. On the other hand, 
the productions of the crafts are real and 
tangible. The merits and demerits of 
things produced by manual effort are 
at once apparent, and they administer 
no less to the comfort and well-being 
of mankind than do those productions

that are more strictly intellectual in 
character. 

The ideal tb be sought in all true 
education, it seems, is the happy com- 
bination of physical and mental train- 
ing, — the cultivation of all the powers 
of mind and body, to render the most 
efficient and useful service in life. Our 
view of fitness for life's work is chang- 
ing. The significance of manual training 
is beginning to be realized. 

"Look where we will," the blind girl 
writes, "we find the hand, in time and 
history, working, building, inventing, 
bringing civilization out of barbar- 
ism. The hand symbolizes power and 
the excellence of work. The mechan- 
ic's hand, that minister of elemental 
forces, the hand that hews, saws, cuts, 
builds, is useful in the world equally 
with the delicate hand that paints a 
wild flower or moulds a Grecian urn, 
or the hand of a statesman that writes 
a law. The eye cannot say to the 
hand, !I have no need of thee.' 
Blessed be the hand! Thrice blessed 
be the hands that work!" 



"IN OR OUT" 

MANY things that were wont 
to be done under the home 
roof are now done to advan- 
tage outside the home in factory and 
shop. For instance, spinning and 
weaving, candle-dropping and soap- 
making, etc., are no longer among 
household processes. The question of 
importance to housekeepers to-day is, 
Shall still more of the household in- 
dustrial processes be taken out of the 
home? The answer, it seems to us, 
depends upon another question, How 
far can this be done with advantage to 

the home ? 

The co-operative laundry, the labo- 
ratory kitchen, and the household aid 
establishment, all are indicative of the 
growing tendency to free the home of 
the "unnecessary trammels' ' of past 



ages. The patronage these new vent- 
ures are receiving is the reason for 
their existence. The law of supply and 
demand holds in household affairs as 
in wider branches of economics, though 
it would sometimes seem that the spirit 
of modern progress reaches the home 
last. But the final solution of all 
home problems of this kind must be 
based upon the ground of expediency. 
Will it pay? Is it cheaper? Does the 
end justify the means ? 

The New England farmer finds it 
cheaper to buy corn and wheat in the 
market than to cultivate those grains: 
hence he turns his attention to other 
crops. Likewise it is cheaper, more 
convenient, and more satisfactory to 
him to buy union-made shoes and ready 
made clothing than to have his shoes 
made at home and wear homespun 
clothing. Similar is the case with 
many another old-time practice. 

And yet, we think, a limit must be 
reached to specialization in practical 
household processes. The interests of 
home must be regarded. The resulting 
influence upon the welfare of home life 
must be the standard by which new 
methods are tested. Many a house- 
wife cannot be employed away from 
home. The same, perhaps, has limited 
resources or income. Whatever she can 
accomplish, through expenditure of time 
and energy in her own home is equiva- 
lent to so much earned or saved. Out- 
side the home her time may be of little 
worth: within, her service has a value 
well-nigh incalculable. 

Just what and how much of the 
routine of housekeeping shall be car- 
ried on under the home roof, then, is an 
intricate and somewhat delicate prob- 
lem. Progressive housekeepers must 
decide this, each for herself. Theoreti- 
cally many a fine project appears wise 
and plausible: in actual practice, how- 
ever, existing conditions must be faced. 
Undoubtedly the foremost household 
problem of the day is the best way of 



402

performing household processes, in order 
to insure the health and comfort of 
the family and the best expenditure of 
the family income. 

In a recent report on this subject, 
Mary Hinman Abel says: "It would 
seem that the household is to be more 
and more served by workers who do 
not live under its roof, and that fac- 
tory products are to be more and more 
utilized. There is no doubt that this 
could profitably be done to a far greater 
extent than is now the case, were there 
common standards or agreement as to 
what is good food and what are hy- 
gienic conditions, and, also, if house- 
keepers were more intelligent as to the 
comparative cost and quality of work 
done in and out of their houses." 



CHOICE IN READING 

WHAT shall we read is a 
question ever more and more 
perplexing. The need of dis- 
crimination and selection in respect to 
reading matter is apparent. One can- 
not attempt to read a tithe even of the 
good things that are published to-day. 
As the case now stands on the part of 
many, the reading habit has become 
nothing less than a kind of dissipation. 

Now it is taken for granted that 
everybody should read at least one 
daily newspaper, in order to be rea- 
sonably informed on the current events 
of the day. We fail to do ourselves 
justice, unless we take a lively interest 
in the affairs of our time. 

Again, periodicals are numerous and 
attractive. Of these each of us has 
his favorite monthlies, but they must 
be read only in part. Some method or 
purpose should inspire all our reading. 

Then, too, there are books and books ; 
and amid this modern babel of books 
who can distinguish the good from the 
bad? But one thing is certain: it is 
worse than wasteful to read other than 
good books. We can wisely wait until 



time has convinced us that a book 
is worthy of perusal. Occupation, line 
of thought, or inquiry, is our best guide 
in the choice of books, ever remem- 
bering that we read to incite thought 
and prepare the way in our respective 
search for truth. 

Finally, we think a religious weekly, 
so called, should be found in every 
home. Some of these publications, we 
find from experience, are weH con- 
ducted, ably edited, and filled with in- 
teresting matter. They deal with sub- 
jects that are of the most vital con- 
cern to us all, and the present ten- 
dency of their teaching is tolerant in

I N all recipes where flour is used, unless otherwise stated, the flour is measured after sifting once. 
* When flour is measured by cups, the cup is filled with a spoon, and a level cupful is meant. A 
tablespoon ful or a teaspoonful of any designated material is a level spoonful of such material.

some other dish, strain the liquor from 
the shells, with that in the saucepan, 
through a piece of doubled cheese-cloth. 
Reheat, and serve in cups, with a spoon- 
ful of whipped cream on the top. 

Creamed Fish in Shells, Potato 
Border 

(Luncheon or Supper, course al Dinner) 
Cook a fresh haddock in a pint of 
water, to which a slice of onion and a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice have been 
added. Remove from the liquid when 
the flesh separates easily from the bones. 
Discard the skin and bones, and sepa- 
rate the fish into flakes. Use the liquid 
in which the fish was cooked, with one- 
fourth the measure of cream, in making 
a white sauce. Allow a cup of sauce for 
each generous cup of the fish. Mix part 
of the sauce with the fish, and dispose 
it in buttered scallop shells. Spread 



Lamb and Tomato Soup 

(7b strve fivt at Dinner or Luncheon) 
To one quart of broth (liquid in which 
breast of yearling lamb has been cooked) 
add one cup of tomato pulp (canned 
tomatoes pressed through a sieve), an 
onion, cut in thin slices, one-fourth a 
carrot, cut in short, match-like strips, 
and a bit of green or red pepper, cut in 
shreds. Let simmer an hour or until the 
vegetables are tender, then add half a 
cup of hot cooked rice and a teaspoonful 
or more of salt. 

Clam Broth with Whipped Cream 

(Soup course at Format Dinner) 
(Str-vt tight or ten) 

Wash and scrub with a brush the 
shells of a peck of clams. Put in a 
large saucepan with two cups of cold 
water, cover the kettle closely, and let 
steam until the shells are well opened. 
Remove the clams from the shells, and

a little more sauce over the top, then through a ricer. Shake the fish from 
pipe mashed potatoes around the edge the potatoes, as it will not pass through 
of the shells. Brush the potato with the ricer easily. Add a little salt and 
the yolk of an egg, beaten and mixed a dash of paprika, then beat the fish and 

potatoes until very 
light. Add one egg, 
beaten light, beating it 
evenly into the mixt- 
ure. Shape the fish 
into slightly irregular 
balls, and fry in a 
basket, five at a time, 
in deep fat. Drain on

Rice Omelet 

(Breakfast, Luncheon, or Supper; 

Have ready from three-fourths to a 
whole cup of hot boiled rice. The rice 
may be fresh-cooked or reheated, if 
only the grains be distinct. The meas- 
urement is for cooked rice. Beat the 
whites of two eggs 
dry. Beat the yolks 
until thick. Add, if 
the rice be dry, other- 
wise not, one table- 
spoonful of cold water, 
one-fourth a teaspoon- 
i'ul of salt, a dash of 
pepper, and the rice: 
mix all together thor- 
oughly, then fold in 
the whites of the eggs. 
Let a tablespoonful of 
butter melt in a hot 
omelet pan, and turn 
in the egg mixture, making it smooth on 
top. Let stand on the top of the range 
about two minutes, to become "set" on 
the bottom, then set the pan into the 
oven. When a knife cut down into the

centre of the mixture comes out clean, 
score the omelet at right angles to the 
handle of the pan, and turn onto a hot 
platter. Garnish with parsley and a 
radish. For varia- 
tion, cook the rice 
in chicken broth or 
tomato pure>, or 
serve with a sauce in 
which the liquid is to- 
mato pulp or chicken 
broth. This is a very 
delicate omelet, well 
suited to the chil- 
dren'stable. For 
adults, nib the bowl 
in which the eggs are 
beaten with garlic, 
and add a tablespoonful of fine-chopped 
chives with the rice. 

Eggs with Spinach Puree 

(Serve with bread or rolls at Breakfast or 

Luncheon) 
Chop fine and press through a sieve 
half a peck of spinach cooked. Season 
to taste with salt, pepper, butter, and 
a dash of lemon juice. When thor- 
oughly mixed and hot, use to line but- 
tered egg dishes or 
small casseroles. 
Break into each nest 
a fresh egg, sprinkle 
the whites of the eggs 
with a few grains of 
salt, and set to cook 
in a moderate oven. 
Serve when the egg 
is "set." 

Macaroni Cro- 
quettes 

Let a cup of tube 
macaroni, broken in 
half-inch lengths, boil 
in rapidly boiling, 
salted water until tender. Drain and 
rinse in cold water, then drain again and 
dry by spreading on a cloth. Make a 
sauce of two table spoonfuls of melted 



butter, three tables poonfuls of flour, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of paprika, 
and a cup of milk, cream, stock, or to- 
mato puree. Add the macaroni, two

mento. Trim the top 
of each pimento 
neatly, to form a per- 
fect edge. (A pair of 
scissors will prove 
satisfactory for this 
purpose.) Beat six eggs without sepa- 
rating. Add a scant teaspoonful of salt, 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, about 
twenty drops of onion juice, and one 
cup and a half of rich milk, and stir 
until well mixed. Use this to fill the

(To ttrvt from six ta nint) 
Let one cup and a half of cooked 
tomatoes, one slice of onion, one-eighth 
a clove of garlic, a piece of bay leaf, a 
teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, a scant 
half- teaspoonful of salt, and a piece of

and mayonnaise dressing. 

Orange-and-Date Salad 

(Main dish for light Luncheon or Dessert at 

Dinner) 

(T. urn* six) 

Pour boiling water over a pound of 



dates. Separate the dates with a fork, 
while the water is brought again to the 
boiling-point. Let boil two 
minutes, then skim out the 
dates and set them into a hot 
oven to dry off. When cool 
enough to handle, take out the 
stones, and cut the flesh into 
narrow strips. Mix five table- 
spoonfuls of oil with one-fourth 
a teaspoonful of salt, then stir 
in one or two tablespoonf uls of 
lemon juice, and, when well 
mixed, pour over the dates. 
Mix thoroughly, and set aside 
in a cool place. Peel from four 
to six oranges, and cut the sections 
of pulp from the membrane, cutting 
through to the centre, and taking out 
each piece whole. Have ready the 
blanched leaves from a head of lettuce, 
washed and thoroughly dried. Turn 
these over and over in a little French 
dressing, and dispose them on the edge 
of a serving-dish. Over the stalk ends 
put the dressed dates, and the oranges 
in the centre. If the salad seems dry, 
add dressing, prepared as before, to the 
oranges, and serve at once. 

Graham Bread

half a cup of lukewarm water. Add two 
tablespoonf uls of butter in a cup of 
scalded -and -cooled milk, and a second 
half-cup of water, also half a cup of 
molasses and a teaspoonful of salt.

Stir in three cups of Graham flour and 
from two to two and one-half cups 
of white flour. Mix very thoroughly, 
but do not mould the mixture. Let 
stand until the dough is doubled in bulk, 
then cut down with a knife, and turn 
into two small pans. Smooth the top 
of the loaves with a knife, wet in hot 
water, and, when nearly doubled in 
bulk, bake about one hour. 

Steamed Graham Bread 
Pass together through a coarse sieve 
two cups of Graham flour, one cup 
of white flour, two teaspoonfuls of 
soda, and one teaspoonful of salt. Mix 
thoroughly with two-thirds a cup of 
molasses and two cups of thick sour 
milk. Steam in a buttered mould from 
three to four hours. Long steam- 
ing improves rather than detracts 
from the quality of any steamed 
bread. 

Buckwheat Griddle Cakes with 
Yeast 

At nine o'clock p.m. soften one-third 
a cake of compressed yeast in one- 
fourth a cup of lukewarm water and 
add to two cups and a half of lukewarm 
water, with a teaspoonful of salt and 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, then stir 
in two cups of sifted buckwheat flour. 
Beat until very smooth, then cover 
and set aside in a warm place (about 
65°F.) to remain until morning. Beat 
thoroughly, and bake on a griddle. 
These should be light and porous 
Save half a cup of the batter to use in 
starting the cakes for another morning. 

Canned Asparagus 
The asparagus needs be fresh. Dis- 
card all but the tender portion of the 
stalks. When trimmed, select stalks 
uniform in length for each jar, Pare 
the lower ends of the stalks, taking off 
the coarse scales, wash thoroughly, 
and put, heads up, into jars, heated by 
rolling in hot water. Have a steam 



cooker over the fire, filled with boiling 
water to the perforated shelf. Put a 
folded towel on the shelf, and on this 
set the cans of asparagus. Do not let 
the cans touch each other or the sides 
of the kettle. Put the jar covers on 
the shelf beside the cans. Cover, and 
let cook one hour. Then add a tea- 
spoonful of salt to each jar, and fill to

three-quarters an hour. Fill to over- 
flow with boiling water. Rinse the 
rubbers in boiling water, adjust these

firm to the bottom of a bowl. This 
can be done most expeditiously with 
a Dover egg-beater. Line an earthen 
bowl, holding a generous quart, with

apricots. Put half an apricot in the bot- 
tom of the bowl, cut other halves in thirds 
lengthwise, and use for the lining. Press 
the remaining pieces of apricot through 
a puree sieve. There should be one cup 
of pulp. Add this cup of pulp, the 
juice of three-fourths a lemon, and three- 
fourths a cup of sugar to the dissolved 
gelatine. Stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved, then set the dish into a pan of 
ice and water, and stir until the mixture 
begins to thicken. 
Then fold in the 
cream, adding it little 
by little. When the 
mixture is firm enough 
to hold its shape, fill 
into the bowl to the 
height of the first row 
of apricots, then set 
the others in place as 
the mould is being 
filled. Add about one- 
fourth a cup of sugar 
and juice of one-fourth 
a lemon to the rest of 
the remaining apricot 
syrup, boil and skim, and, whencold, use 
as a sauce for the dish. Evaporated 
apricots, cooked, are suitable for this 
dish. 



St. Honore Cake 

(7» urvt six or eigbl) 
{Sweet dish for Luncheon or Dinner) 
Cut out a round of pastry about one- 
fourth an inch thick 
and six or seven inches 
in diameter. Set on a 
baking sheet, and prick 
repeatedly with a fork, 
that in rising it may puff 
evenly. With pastry 
bag and plain tube 
(these mav be shaped 
with a teaspoon) shape 
small rounds from chou- 
paste mixture. Bake 
the balls until light, 
about twenty minutes. 
Cook one-fourth a cup 
of sugar and two tablespoon fuls of water 
to a thick syrup. Dip the top of the 
paste balls into the syrup, then sprinkle 
them with small candies of assorted 
colors. Dip the base of the balls in 
the syrup, and set them upon the round 
of pastry, to form a wall. Pipe cold 
St. Honore cream into the centre. 

Chou Paste

into a mixing-bowl, and beat in one 
egg. When the egg is thoroughly 
incorporated into the mixture, beat 
in another, and shape the mixture at 
once. 

St. Honore Cream 

Scald one cup of milk. Pass through 
the sieve together, several times, half 
a cup of sugar and one- third a cup of 
flour. Dilute with a little of the hot 
milk, then stir the whole into the rest 
of the hot milk, adding at the same 
time the grated yellow rind of an 
orange. Stir and cook until the mixt- 
ure thickens, then beat in the yolks of 
three eggs, beaten until thick, and fold 
in the whites of three eggs, beaten dry 
with one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt. 
Do not add the whites of the eggs until 
the yolks are ' ' set." Cook the mixture, 
after the whites are added, until the 
whites are set, or the custard will not 
be firm enough to hold its shape. • 

Delight Pudding 

Mix one pint (about six ounces) of 
bread crumbs with half a cup of soft- 
ened butter. Beat the yolks of two 
eggs. Add one cup of milk and half a 
cup of molasses. Sift together one- 
third a cup of flour, half a teaspoonful, 
each, of soda, salt, mace, and cloves, 
and one teaspoonful of cinnamon, then 
mix these through a cup of seeded 
raisins, cut in halves (Sultana raisins 
need no cutting). Add the flour, con- 
diments, and raisins to the buttered 
crumbs, and mix the whole to a dough 
with the liquid mixture. Steam in 
a two-quart mould (lined with paper, if 
plain), thoroughly buttered. Serve hot 
with the following sauce. 

Sauce for Pudding 

Cream half a cup of butter. Gradu- 
ally beat in one cup of sugar, and 
then the whites of two eggs, beaten

brandy. 



Glazed Currant Buns 

(Awarded Prize at Food Exhibit) 

Soften a cake of compressed yeast in 
half a cup of scalded-and-cooled milk, 
and add to a pint of the same. Stir in 
about three cups of flour, beat until very 
smooth, then cover, and set to rise. 
When light, add half a cup of sugar, half 
a cup of softened butter, one teaspoonful % 
of salt, three eggs, one cup of cleaned 
currants, and about three cups of flour. 
Knead until elastic, and set to rise. 
When doubled in bulk, roll out into a 
sheet, and cut into rounds. Set the 
rounds, a little distance apart, on a bak- 
ing-sheet, and, when doubled in bulk, 
bake about twenty-five minutes. Brush 
over with thin starch (a teaspoonful of 
cornstarch to a cup of boiling water), 
sprinkle thickly with granulated sugar, 
and return to the oven to glaze. Re- 
peat the glazing process until a heavy 
coating is formed. This recipe makes 
two pans of buns. See page 403. 

Filling for Oyster Patties with 
Brown Sauce 

(For six or right patties) 
(Entree at Formal Luncheon or Dinner) 

Heat a solid pint of oysters to the 
boiling-point in their own juice, stirring 
meanwhile with a silver fork, that none 
may be uncooked. Drain thoroughly, 
and cut the oysters in halves. Melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. In it cook 
a slice of onion until it is yellowed and 
softened. Take out the onion, and cook 
the butter to a chestnut-brown color, 
then add four tablespoonfuls of flour 
with one-fourth a teaspoonful, each, 
of salt and pepper. Stir and cook until 
the flour is well browned, then add one 
cup of brown stock, and stir and cook 
until smooth and the boiling-point is 
reached. Add the oysters, and let them 
become hot by setting the dish, covered, 
in a saucepan of boiling water. The 
sauce should be rather thick. With some 



4ia 



Tht Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



brands of flour (all flour loses some of 
its thickening power when browned) 
more than the quantity indicated will 
be needed. If the patties are not fresh 
baked, reheat them before filling. 

Planked Halibut 

(Main dish at Lenten Dinner or fish course in 
Men's Dinner of few courses) 

(7*0 seme twelve) 

Select a solid piece of chicken hali- 
but, cut the entire width of the fish, and 
weighing about four pounds. Trim 
the ends. Put half a dozen slices of 
onion in an agate baking-pan, and on 
these lay the fish. Squeeze the juice 
of half a lemon over it, dot with bits of 
butter, and pour around half a cup of 
white wine and half a cup of chicken 
stock, mushroom or oyster liquor. 
Cook about forty minutes, basting at 
least six times with the liquid in the 
pan. Salt when half cooked. Trans- 
fer to a hot hard-wood "plank." Pipe 
hot mashed potato around it, brush 
over the potato with the yolk of an 
egg, beaten and diluted with a table- 
spoonful of milk, and return to hot 
oven, to brown the edges of the potato. 
Pill the space between the fish and 
potato with hot peas, seasoned with 
salt, black pepper, and butter, and set 
hot asparagus tips upright in rings 
cut from a cooked carrot. Serve fish 
Bechamel sauce and Hollandaise sauce 
in separate sauce-boats. Serve also 
cucumber salad. See outside cover. 

Tomato Souffle 

Drain the liquid from a can of toma- 
toes. Then cut enough whole tomatoes 
into half-inch pieces, discarding the 
seeds, to fill a cup. Make a sauce of 
two tablespoonfuls, each, of butter and 



flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, a dash 
of paprika, and a cup of strained tomato. 
(A more pronounced flavor is obtained, 
if the tomato be reduced by cooking.) 
Add the crumb of a slice of bread, 
rubbed with a crushed clove of garlic 
and pressed through a colander, to 
make it fine. Stir in the pieces of 
tomato and the yolks of three eggs, 
beaten light. Fold in the whites of 
three eggs, beaten dry, and bake in a 
buttered dish. Individual dishes are 
rather better than one large dish. 
Serve as soon as well puffed up and firm 
to the touch. 

Salt Fish Souffle 

Make as above, using salt fish, picked 
fine, and left standing an hour or more 
in cold water in the place of the cup of 
tomato. Milk may also take the place 
of the strained tomato. 

Hebrew Pickles 

For about a pint of pickle, grate two 
roots of horseradish. Mix with it two 
tablespoonfuls of celery-seed, three 
tablespoonfuls of mustard-seed, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and one table- 
spoonful of tumeric. Cover the in- 
gredients with scalding hot vinegar. 
Seal in glass jars. Let stand one week 
before use. 

Entire-wheat Muffins 

Pass together through a sieve two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one cup of 
entire-wheat flour, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, and two (level) teaspoonfuls 
of baking-powder. Beat one egg, 
without separating the white and yolk. 
Add three-fourths a cup of milk, and 
stir gradually into the dry ingredients. 
Bake in a hot, buttered roll-pan.

The Composition of Menus 

THE making out of a menu is 
not the simple thing it appears 
to be at first sight. When 
asked to send a menu for some spe- 
cial occasion, we often think of the 
naive remark of a young lady of our 
acquaintance, ' 'Why, anybody can 
write menus, when they are not obliged 
to think of the cost of the dishes 
they suggest, and the people for whom 
they are written are not sick." But 
cost is not the sole item to be considered, 
even in writing menus for people who 
are supposedly in good health. To be 
sure, certain conventional dishes one 
soon learns to connect with different 
meals, as eggs with breakfast, dishes 
in individual portions with luncheon, 
roasts with dinner, and cold meats, 
sliced thin, with supper. These, how- 
ever, are but single ideas, whereas a 
menu is a collection of ideas or thoughts 
expressed in systematic or logical order. 
The late Sir Henry Thompson wrote 
of a dinner as "a complete symphony, 
with preliminary introduction, followed 
by a bright, sparkling minuet, which, 
in its turn, leads to the grand finale, 
while this in its course may present a 
plaintive minor passage, giving force 
and splendor to the resumption of the 
major key before the close." He also 
wrote, "The attainment of perfection 



through variety is as essential to the 
idea of a dinner as to that of a complete 
musical composition." 

As a letter proclaims to the receiver 
the status of the writer, so does a menu 
disclose to those who partake of it 
the individuality of the composer. The 
degree of one's cultivation in dietetics 
is shown just as plainly in the compo- 
sition of a menu as is the extent of one's 
musical education in the composition 
of a piece of music. 

Almost daily pupils and house- 
keepers ask, "How can I learn to com- 
pose menus?" To such there is but 
one reply: Study food, study menus. 
Weigh and consider. "If thou love 
learning, thou shalt be learned." 

The basis of the matter, as in all 
subjects pertaining to dietetics, is 
knowledge of the composition of food 
and the effect upon it of moisture and 
heat at different temperatures. One 
must understand how different results 
in form, texture, and flavor may be 
produced and what the effects are upon 
the system. 

A knowledge of what the market 
affords at different seasons of the year 
is a second essential. This is not, per- 
haps, as necessary now in the days of 
gardening, canning, and cold storage, 
as it was years ago, when peas and cu- 
cumbers in midwinter were simply un- 



416

attainable. Still there is a time when 
each product, though brought from 
afar, is at its best, and that is the mo- 
ment when this, before all else, should 
be suggested. 

A "heavy" dinner, or a dinner con- 
taining several substantial dishes, is 
better suited to winter than to summer, 
and to a party of men than to a party 
of women. More dishes should be in- 
cluded in a menu to be served to twelve 
guests than in one to be served to half 
that number. A larger number of 
sweet dishes should be provided for a 
party of men and women than when 
men only are to sit at table. The out- 
line or working plan of all dinners is 
substantially the same, and as follows: 

An article should appear but in one 
course. Sauces and meats should vary, 
from course to course, in color and in 
kind. 

The texture of articles (particularly 
is this the case with entries) should be 
diversified. 

The Dinner in Outline 

i . A light introduction to the meal, 
— the preface. 

This introduction may consist of one dish 
or several, as either an appetizer, a soup, or 
fish, or all three. In case of a large number 
of guests two soups and two kinds of fish may 
be provided, as consomme and green turtle 
soup, or a puree of game (a cream soup is 
too rich for a light introduction), a white fish 
with rich sauce, and salmon or some other 
rich fish with a plain sauce. The methods of 
cooking should be different. 

2. The piece de resistance, the sub- 
stantial dish of the meal. 

Formerly a roast of meat was provided, 
but at present a substantial entree is just as 
appropriate. 

3. A dish of marked flavor, easily 
digested, usually game with a simple 
salad. 

4. A sweet dish. 

For large dinners a hot sweet dish is followed 
by a cold sweet dish, and this in turn by an 



iced dish, as baba with hot sauce, charlotte 
russe with wine jelly, a handsome ice. 

5. A savory tidbit (hot or cold), as 
tiny individual cheese souffles or Ca- 
membert. 

This is the foundation of the con- 
ventional dinner, though often it is so 
modified by the addition of entrees, 
the introduction of punch, to clear the 
palate for th£ game, and the multi- 
plicity of dishes in the sweet course, 
that one is often inclined to think the 
general plan has been completely lost 
sight of. 

But one may ask : What vegetables, 
if any, are to be served with these 
courses? When is bread to be sup- 
plied? How is one to know when to 
pass olives or jelly or salad? These 
are simple items to decide when one 
has the key to the situation. The 
first law in food combinations is that 
of physiological necessity. Is a dish 
provided? almost intuitively we look 
for its complement, for that which 
shall make it complete. Is the dish 
rich and oily? we dilute the richness 
with bread or potato, — not both, — 
with macaroni or rice, and for bulk add 
green vegetables, and introduce a mild 
acid to aid in separating the droplets 
of fat. Thus comes the green vege- 
table salad, apple or cranberry sauce, 
with the roast. Having satisfied physi- 
ological necessity, we consider the mat- 
ter aesthetically, and seek for the par- 
ticular dish or flavor that best harmo- 
nizes or contrasts with the plat. 

To some extent each is a discoverer 
in this line; but after a time, when we 
have become conversant with books 
and authors, we find that many of our 
discoveries have, in reality, been worked 
out long before our day; as the com- 
binations of beef and potatoes, chicken 
and rice, mutton and macaroni, hom- 
iny and wild ducks, mint sauce and 
green peas with lamb, apple sauce with 
goose and pork, and cranberry sauce 
with turkey. 



A Prune Symposium 

By Frances Ellison Peck 



PRUNES possess a worthiness 
that entitles them to more ap- 
preciative consideration at the 
hands of the housewife than they 
usually receive. The cook is apt to 
look on them as a sort of Cheap John 
among fruits, with a Dotheboys-third- 
rate-boarding-house reputation, which 
there is no ennobling or uplifting. And 
all this disrepute comes, first, from 
their being, like the poor, always with 
us, and consequently lacking the charm 
they would possess if they had a certain 
season annually, like other fruits, of 
being on the market ; second, from their 
very inexpensiveness, which robs them, 
of the glamour of exclusiveness ; and, 
third, from the lack of knowledge on 
the part of the average housewife as 
to the best culinary treatment to bring 
out their many good points. 

The usual mode of procedure is to 
give them a hasty rinse off, put them 
over the stove with water galore and 
sugar in accord with the cook's gener- 
osity, and let them boil like a geyser 
until the Lady of the Kitchen remem- 
bers to take them off. Perhaps they 
will have been over the fire for so short a 
time that they will not be much softer 
than when they were set to cook, or 
they may be an unsightly mush. It 
matters not: they are only "stewed 
prunes." Is it any wonder that with 
such treatment they refuse to show 
really the possibilities that lurk within 
their wrinkled brown skins? That 
these possibilities are many, the follow- 
ing recipes will prove. 

They are one of the most healthful 
of fruits, especially for children and 
old people, being laxative in their 
action. A few, prepared as for stewing 
and tucked into the school lunch-basket, 
are a welcome alternate with the big 



red apple or orange which generally 
finds a niche in Tommy's or Dottie's 
little stomach at recess. If they are 
chopped after being soaked over night, 
or until they have attained nearly their 
original size, sprinkled with sugar, and 
spread between slices of buttered whole- 
wheat bread and served with a glass of 
slowly sipped milk, they form an ideal 
meal for the growing child. 

A vigorous cleansing is the first step, 
in preparing prunes for the table. A 
sturdy scrubbing with a vegetable 
brush in warm water, and rinsing by 
placing in a colander and holding them 
under the flow from the cold water 
faucet, is none too strenuous treatment 
to insure perfect cleanliness. Then 
cover with tepid water to level, and 
let stand over night "in soak.' 1 In the 
morning place on the extreme back of 
the range, and let them cook, barely 
simmering, until soft, but firm and 
unbroken. Drain from the syrup, and 
to the latter add sugar, not over 
two tablespoonfuls to the liquid that 
has covered one pound of fruit. Let 
this boil up, and pour it over the 
prunes. 

Sweet Pickled Prunes 

Wash and soak the fruit as for 
stewing. Put in a stone jar, and make 
a syrup in the proportion of one quart 
of the best cider vinegar to three pints 
of sugar. Boil and skim, and pour 
over the fruit, boiling hot, for three 
successive mornings. Then drain off 
the syrup, put a layer of fruit in a jar, 
sprinkle with bits of stick cinnamon, a 
few cloves, and allspice, then another 
layer of fruit and spices, and so on till 
all are used. Boil down the syrup until 
as thick as honey, and pour over the 
fruit, having enough to completely 



4i8 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



submerge the latter. Cover closely, 
and set in a cool place. 

Crystalized Prunes 

Soak over night and stew, but do 
not cook to quite the degree of softness 
required in prunes prepared for sauce. 
Drain, and, when cold, cut an incision 
with a sharp knife, and remove the 
pit by cutting and scraping the pulp 
carefully away. Boil one cup and a 
half of sugar and three-quarters of a 
cup of milk until thick. Stir in a 
tablespoonful of melted chocolate and 
half a cup of chopped nuts. Beat until 
it becomes a thick creamy substance. 
Fill the prunes with this cream. Press 
closely together. Dip in gum water 
(made by dissolving one ounce of gum 
arabic in one pint of water), roll in 
granulated sugar, and set in a warm 
place to dry. If a slight dusting of 
cinnamon be added to the sugar coating, 
these make a most harmonious sweet to 
offer, with a cup of chocolate and an 
unsweetened wafer, to the friend who 
"drops in." 

Prune Delight 

Soak and slightly stew one pound of 
prunes. Remove the pits, and add 
half a pound of candied cherries that 
have been soaked in sherry an hour, 
and a cup of walnut or pecan meats. 
Put all through a meat or fruit grinder, 
and knead in confectioner's sugar suf- 
ficient to make a thick paste that can 
be rolled out to the thickness of an 
inch. Cut in squares, roll in powdered 
sugar, and wrap in waxed paper. 

Prune Meringue 

Stew one pound of soaked prunes 
in one cup of water until tender. Pass 
them through a colander into a serving- 
dish, and add a teaspoonful of butter, 
beating it in well. Separate the whites 
of two eggs from the yolks. Beat the 
latter until light, add three tablespoon- 
fuls of rich cream and the zest of a 



lemon, and whip the mixture into the 
prunes. Beat the whites of the eggs 
to a stiff froth, add to them two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and spread this 
meringue over the prune mixture. 
Sprinkle with fine-chopped almonds, and 
lightly brown in the oven. Serve with 
sweetened cream. 

Ebony Mould 

Stew until soft, in very little water, 
a quart of prunes. Rub through a col- 
ander, and add to the pulp a cup of 
sugar and an ounce of gelatine, softened 
in half a cup of water and dissolved 
over hot water. Pour into a mould, 
and set in the ice-box until firm. 
Turn from the mould, pipe a wreath 
of whipped cream around the base, 
decorate with crystalized cherries and 
angelica, and serve with sponge 
cake. This is a very ornamental 
dish. 

" Etherealized " Prune Pie 

Line a pie plate with a rich paste, 
and cover with a pint of stewed-and- 
sifted prunes, slightly sweetened. Beat 
a piece of butter, the size of an egg t to 
a cream with two tablespoonfuls of 
fine sugar, two tablespoonfuls of fine, 
soft bread crumbs, and the yolks of 
two eggs, well beaten. Add the whites 
whipped to a stiff froth. Spread this 
mixture over the prunes, and bake in 
a moderate oven. 

Prune Kuchen 

Sift one pint of flour with a quarter 
teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, and a teaspoonful and a 
half of baking-powder. Rub in two 
rounding tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
moisten with two-thirds a cup of milk 
and a beaten egg. Mix together quickly 
and well, and pat out with the hands 
until about an inch thick. Fit into 
a square buttered pan, and press into 
the dough a layer of stewed prunes, 
halved and with the skin side down. 



A Prune Symposium 



419 



Pour over two or three tablespoonfuls 
of melted butter, dust with sugar and 
a trifle of cinnamon, and bake twenty 
minutes. 

Prune Float 

Beat the whites of three eggs to a 
stiff froth. Add six tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar, and beat five minutes. 
Then whip in three tablespoonfuls of 
stewed prunes, sifted-and-sweetened. 
When thoroughly incorporated, turn 
into a pretty dish, and set away to 
chill. Prepare a cream by blanching 
and pounding to a paste two ounces 
of sweet almonds. Add a pint of milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and three 
beaten egg yolks. Cook over hot water 
until creamy; chill, and pour around the 
prune mixture. 

Prune Charlotte 

Stew eighteen large prunes. Re- 
move the pits, and cut in three or four 
pieces. Make a boiled custard with 
one quart of rich milk, the yolks of six 
e ggs, and a cup of sugar. Line a glass 



dish with slices of sponge cake dipped 
in sherry. Add a layer of the prunes, 
then another layer of cake, and fruit as 
before. When the custard is cold, 
pour it over the whole. Beat the 
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar and a 
flavoring of almond, and heap on the 
top.*- 

Another Prune Charlotte 

One-third a box of gelatine, one-third 
a cup of cold water, one-third a cup of 
boiling water, one cup, equal parts, of 
prune pulp and orange juice, one cup 
of sugar, whites of three eggs, and juice 
of a lemon. Line a dainty dish with 
lady fingers. Soak the gelatine in cold 
water until soft, and pour on the boil- 
ing water. Add the sugar and the 
lemon juice, and the prune pulp and 
orange. Set in a pan of crushed ice, 
and, when it begins to harden, beat it 
until light and fluffy. Then add the 
whipped whites, and beat together until 
firm. Pour into the cake-lined mould, 
and serve very cold.

Bake J Beans 



Hot, fresh-baked beans : a hearty dish, 

As poet or ploughman could wish. 

The Puritan, Saturday night, 

With beans began his Sabbath right; 

Next day they had a saving grace; 

On Monday, cold, they held their place. 

Each day from baking they remove, 

Some gourmands say, they so improve. 

As Boston in their favor leans, 

It must be true, there's naught like beans. 



Apple Pie 



Search heaven and earth, and sea and sky 

Nothing compares to apple pie. 

No wonder that on Eden's tree 

Adam the fruit could only see; 

But woman used, as well as eyes, 

Her hands, — you see, we've apple pies. 

And, when for us a pie is cut, 

All Eden's charms are well forgot. 

This fact, then, shows that Adam's fall 

Was not so serious, after all.

1 FOUND in a department store 
in Boston, more than three years 
ago, a round wire broiler with a short 
handle, which I have ever since used 
to broil breakfast bacon on, in the 
oven, placing it over a round tin 
pan. It is easier, I think, to use than 
the long-handled broiler shown in the 
January number of this magazine.

Quick Way of Making Mayon- 
naise Dressing 

BEAT the yolk of one egg well 
with a Dover egg-beater; add a 
dash, each, of cayenne, paprika, and 
mustard, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and a pinch of sugar. Add the juice 
of one lemon, beating it in thoroughly, 
then add the oil. The mixture will 
take up oil as fast as it is added: no 
care need be taken to add it "drop by 
drop." Continue beating in the oil until 
the mixture is of the right consistency. 
If the egg and lemon are thoroughly 
mixed and the oil be cold, but not in 
the least congealed, this dressing will 
never curdle. Mrs. W. N. S. 

Note. — The quantity of salt and of 
lemon juice given would indicate the 
use of two cups, or a pint, of oil. A 
juicy lemon will yield four tablespoonfuls 
of juice. For some tastes two table- 
spoonfuls, each, of lemon juice and 
vinegar would be preferred, or vinegar 
alone may be used. The dressing can 
be mixed just as successfully with the 
one acid as with the other. We recom- 



mend this way of mixing mayonnaise to 
all those amateurs who mix mayonnaise 
with fear and trembling, and who are 
accustomed to add the oil, at first, drop 
by drop.— Ed. 

New Prune Pudding 

A RICH and delicious prune pud- 
ding is made by stewing raisins 
with prunes until both are tender, then 
cover with a good biscuit crust. Bake 
and serve with cream. g. s. 



THE old adage about how much 
a woman can throw out at the 
back door with a spoon is veritably 
true; for it is the disregard of small 
articles of food left over and the reck- 
less extravagance of the incompetent 
and, I might also add, the competent 
cook that eat up the large as well as 
the small incomes which are brought 
into the average home to-day. 

On each bread-and-butter plate, in 
a family of four, there were small 
fragments of creamery butter left; 
but why bother to scrape them into 
the jar for cooking purposes? Fresh 
butter has just been ordered; and, as 
there is plenty in the ice-chest, why 
go to all that trouble? 

At breakfast the ham was delicately 
browned, and the eggs fried just to 
perfection; but, when one of the fam- 
ily suggested that a little of the ham 
gravy would be acceptable on the 
buckwheat cakes, he was met with 
the reply that it had been poured into 
the garbage pail. 

A whole egg was dropped into the

coffee-pot that morning, because it 
was late, and the coffee was made in 
a hurry; but one-third of the egg would 
have made better coffee. 

The carcass of Sunday's turkey had 
made a delicious soup for the chil- 
dren's luncheon, if it had been set 
away properly. But, left on the plat- 
ter most often in use, in the rush of 
getting Monday's breakfast the house- 
keeper said, "J ust throw out those 
old turkey bones." 

Tomatoes and celery, left last night, 
had likewise disappeared, because 
there was "only a little left." 

The careful housewife saves every- 
thing. A half-cup of tomatoes may 
add flavor to to-morrow's plain broth. 
Peas and beans, the liquid drained 
off, may help out on a Russian salad 
by the addition of a few cold potatoes, 
olives, and some of yesterday's roast 
beef, cut fine, and mixed with may- 
onnaise. Bits of ham, nicely minced, 
help make a savory omelet; and even 
muffins left over, cut open, and toasted 
and eaten with jam, help make a tooth- 
some lunch. 

The frugal housewife who buys the 
best materials in the market, and then 
uses them carefully, understands true 
economy. With meats small roasts 
are not palatable; and large ones are 
extravagant, unless the parts left over 
are wisely utilized. 

Below, I give a recipe I have often 
used with success: — 

Meat and Rice Loaf 

Two cups of cold meat, chopped 
fine, two cups of cold rice, two eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of parsley, chopped, 
one-half a small onion, also chopped 
fine, salt and pepper. 

Fry the onion in butter till a nice 
brown. Put in cold rice and meat, 
and stir well. Remove from the fire. 
Add eggs, well beaten, without sep- 
arating the yolks and whites, and 



parsley and seasoning. Pack in a 
buttered baking-dish, and, when baked 
brown, turn onto a platter, and pour 
over a sauce made of tomatoes, 
strained, thickened with a little flour, 
and seasoned highly. Bread crumbs 
can be used instead of rice; and, by 
adding a little powdered sage, it makes 
a very nice dish. 



Guinea Fowl Broiled 

Split the fowl down the entire length 
of the back, and remove all unedible 
portions. Wipe neatly inside and out 
with a cloth wet repeatedly in cold 
water. Run a skewer through the 
wings and body, to keep the fowl flat 
and in position. The fowl may be 
broiled over a coal fire that is not too 
bright, but it can be broiled quite 
as satisfactorily under the flame of a 
gas range. Have the gridiron hot 
and well oiled. Lay the fowl on the 
iron with the inner side toward the 
heat. Let cook five or six minutes 
before turning. Cook but a few sec- 
onds at a time on the skin side, to 
avoid burning. Each time, after 
turning, brush over with melted butter. 
Cook about thirty minutes. Have 
ready about four slices of bread, from 
which the crust has been removed, 
nicely toasted. Moisten the edges of 
these with the melted butter in the 
pan or the broth in which the giblets 
were cooked. Spread with the cooked 
livers mashed with butter and seasoned 
with salt and paprika. (The other 
giblets cooked and chopped may also 
be used with the liver.) Upon the 
toast dispose the fowl, spreading them 
generously with creamed butter. Gar- 
nish with cress. Serve Baltimore 
samp or hulled corn, cooked in cream, 
in a dish apart. Serve with them, 
also, a green salad.

from the moulds. It is perhaps some 
fault in the baking. Brush the inside 
of the moulds very thoroughly with 
olive oil or butter, melted and freed 
from the salty sediment. Use a tea- 
spoon in putting the cake mixture into 
the moulds and make sure that the 
mixture settles to the bottom of the 
moulds. Turn from the moulds as 
soon as the cakes are taken from the 
oven.

two cups of molasses, two beaten eggs, 
one cup of cold water or milk, then 
stir in three cups of flour, sifted with 
two tablespoonfuls of soda and one

Query 989.— P. P. H., Cincinnati, Ohio: 
"Does the term au gratin include the idea of 
cheese?" 

Au Gratin and Cheese 

The term au gratin is applied to 
certain dishes prepared with a sauce, 
covered with buttered crumbs, and 
baked in the oven until the crumbs are 
browned. The article is served in 
the dish in which it is baked, and this 
is usually shallow. Cheese is often 
mixed with the crumbs, but is not an 
item essential to the dish.

Veal Loaf (Raw Veal) 

Pass three pounds and one-half of 
raw veal, one-fourth a pound of fat 
salt pork, and one-fourth a pound of 
cooked ham through a food-chopper, 
with six common crackers. Add one 
tablespoonful of salt, three eggs, beaten 
without separating the whites and 
yolks, three tablespoonfuls (or more, 
if needed, to make the mixture cling 
together) of cream, milk, white or 
tomato sauce, and one teaspoonful of 
pepper. Add, also, at discretion, the 
grated rind and juice of half a lemon, 
a teaspoonful of sweet herbs or parsley, 
and half a teaspoonful of mace. Mix 
the ingredients thoroughly, and shape 
into a compact loaf. Slide on to a tin 
sheet, and set this on the rack in the 
baking-pan. Cover with slices of bacon 
or salt pork, and bake between two 
and three hours, basting every ten 
minutes with bacon or salt pork fat. 
Serve cold, sliced thin. 



Qubry 991. — Mrs. A. C. B., Cincinnati, 
Ohio: "Kindly give suggestions for the best 
finish for kitchen and bath-room, referring 
especially to walls and ceiling. What quan- 
tity is represented in a cake of compressed 
yeast?" 

The Walls and Ceiling of Kitchen 

and Bath-room 

The walls and ceiling of the kitchen 
and bath-room may be painted or 
covered with a washable paper. Tiles 
are most expensive, and most satisfac- 
tory. Side walls are often tiled to the 
height of four to six feet. The wood- 
work in these rooms is usually covered 
with "spar" varnish. 

Weight of Compressed Yeast Cake 

The compressed yeast cake referred 
to is about one inch square and one- 
fourth inch thick. It weighs about 
one-fourth an ounce.

Query 994— F. F. H., Toledo, Ohio: "Di- 
rections for making a French omelet." 

French Omelet 

In making a French omelet, much 
depends on the condition of the pan. 
The inner surface needs be so smooth 
that, when the pan is shaken over the 
fire, the cooked mixture will slide upon 
it (forming creases where it doubles 
upon itself), thus letting the uncooked 
portion down upon the hot surface. 



A steel pan is preferable, and should 
be kept for this purpose alone. After 
using, rinse out thoroughly with hot 
water, and dry and polish with fine, 
soft tissue paper. Small omelets are 
handled more easily than large ones. 
Beat two eggs and the yolks of two 
more with a kitchen spoon or silver 
fork, until a full spoonful can be taken 
up. Add one-fourth a teaspoonful of 
salt, three tablespoonfuls of water, 
and a dash of pepper, if desired. Mix 
thoroughly, then strain into a bowl. 
Have a tablespoonful of butter melted 
in the omelet-pan. Bring this for- 
ward to a hot part of the range, let 
stand a minute, then turn in the egg 
mixture. Shake the pan back and 
forth with one hand, and, with a spatula 
or thin knife in the other, separate 
the cooked egg from the pan at the 
edge, so that in shaking, the uncooked 
egg may at this point run down onto 
the hot pan. Raise the side of the pan 
next the handle, in shaking forward, and 
lower it, when the pan is brought back. 
When nearly creamy throughout, roll 
the omelet, let stand a moment to color 
a little, then turn onto a hot serving- 
dish.

Qubry 996. — E. E. D., Duluth, Minn.: 
"How prepare grape juice to serve as a first 
course at luncheon or for a hot spicy drink 
in the evening? How prepare stewed figs 
and raisins? In what shape can samp be 
bought? In making butter balls, should the 
paddles be very cold? Is it true that milk 
keeps better when not closely covered ?" 

Grape Juice for First Course at 

Luncheon 

Add a few spoonfuls to a salpicon 
of fruits. Serve in small glasses. Grape 
juice and orange juice, half and half, 
with the juice of a lemon for each pint, 
added to a quart of water and a pint of 
sugar boiled fifteen minutes and cooled, 
make a most delicious sherbet. 

Grape Juice as Hot Drink 

Cook a piece of stick cinnamon and 
a dozen doves in a quart of water. 
When well flavored with the spices, 
add a cup of sugar. Cook ten minutes. 
Strain and keep hot. When ready to 
serve, add a pint of grape juice and the 
juice of a lemon. 

Stewed Figs and Raisins 

Wash whole dried figs very thor- 
oughly. Drain, cover with boiling 
water, and let cook in a covered dish 
until the skin is tender. Near the 
end of cooking, remove the cover, 
add a few tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
let cook until the liquid becomes a 
syrup. Serve cold with whipped cream. 
Cook and serve large raisins in the same 
way. The flavor is retained in the 
fruit, if it be set to cook in boiling 
water. 

Samp

1. Also note that the moulds, hands, 
paddles, or whatever utensil is used in 
shaping the butter, after having been 
properly treated with hot and cold 
water, are dipped into cold water after 
each shaping of butter. 

Keeping Milk Covered or 

Uncovered 

As milk and all food not to be cooked 
before sending to the table are liable 
to be contaminated by bacteria, floating 
in the air, it is considered a wise precau- 
tion to keep all such articles carefully 
covered. As a warm temperature is 
conducive to rapid growth of bacteria, 
milk should not only be cooled as soon 
as it is drawn, but it should be kept — at 
all seasons of the year— in a cool place. 
A bottle or can of milk left standing 
an hour or two in a hot kitchen — 
even if it be cold weather outside and 
the bottle be covered — is not in as 
good condition as milk kept in a cool 
place.

and add a tablespoonful of cream. 
Heat half a cup of cream and one- 
fourth a cup of milk in a double boiler. 
Stir in the chocolate mixture, gradually, 
diluted with the hot cream and milk, 
then stir in the yolks of the eggs, and 
fold in the whites of the eggs, beaten 
dry. Turn the mixture into a buttered 
souffle dish, sprinkled with sugar, and 
let cook, standing on several folds of 
paper and surrounded with hot water, 
until the centre is firm. It will take 
from ten to twenty minutes, accord- 
ing to the depth of the mixture in 
the pan. Serve with whipped cream, 
sweetened and flavored with vanilla. 

Chocolate Souffle 2 

Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Cook in it three tablespoonfuls of flour 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, 
then add one cup of milk. Stir until 
the boiling-point is reached, then add 
two ounces of melted chocolate and 
one-third a cup of sugar. Remove

yolks of three eggs. Then fold in 
the whites of three eggs, beaten dry. 
Bake as in the first recipe. Serve 
with whipped cream, or with Sabayon 
or frothy sauce. 

Frothy Sauce 

Cream half a cup of butter. Grad- 
ually beat in a cup of sugar, then the 
white of an egg, beaten dry. Stir

tablespoonfuls of wine or a teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla extract. 

Sabayon Sauce 

Beat one whole egg and two yolks. 
Then gradually beat in half a cup of 
sugar. Set over hot water, and beat 
constantly, while half a cup of sherry 
wine is gradually added. When the 
sauce has thickened slightly, add a 
teaspoonful of lemon juice, and turn 
into a cold dish, to arrest the cooking. 
Serve hot. (This sauce is in reality 



a boiled custard, in which wine takes 
the place of milk.)

Failing Eyesight 

(Caused by Improper Food) 

Writers who live sedentary lives and 
who use coffee are apt to be troubled by 
faulty vision, which they usually attrib- 
ute to overwork. That they are some- 
times mistaken is proved by the follow- 



ing statement from an old newspaper 
man: — 

"For nearly forty years I have earned 
my living with the pen. A few years 
ago I began to suffer from occasional 
'blind spells.' My vision frequently 
became obscured by what may be called 
kaleidoscopic blurs, in which con- 
stantly changing figures, like wheels, 
stars, etc., floated before my eyes, mak- 
ing it impossible for me to work while 
they lasted. They were usually fol- 
lowed by dull, heavy headaches. 

"My physicians, two of them, advised 
me that my eyes had become weakened 
by overwork. I consulted an oculist, 
but he could not discover the cause of 
the trouble. I bought stronger glasses, 
but they did not help me. 

"Last summer, while living tempo- 
rarily in a boarding-house, I found the 
very weak coffee a thing to complain 
of, till suddenly I discovered that my 
'blind spells' were becoming less fre- 
quent. I then satisfied myself by ex- 
periments that it was coffee that was 
deranging my optic nerves. 

"A friend advised me to try Postum 
coffee, and, although I had no faith in it, 
I began to use it. In three days' time 
the .'blind spells 1 completely ceased. 
Going back to the old coffee, the 'blind 
spells' returned. I am entirely satisfied 
that coffee was the cause of the ailment, 
and that Postum was its cure." Name 
given by Postum Company, Battle 
Creek, Mich. 

There's a reason. Coffee is a narcotic 
that breaks down the cells in the nerve 
centres, and, unless, nature succeeds in 
repairing the damage each day, disease 
and distress follow in some one or more 
organs. It may be eyes in one, stomach 
and bowels in another, heart or kidnevs 
in another, and yet each affected from 
the same cause, coffee. The sure wav to 
certainly know is to quit coffee ten days, 
and use Postum. If the disease begins 
to disappear, you have the key to your 
puzzle.

"Recipe for crab salad made of canned crab

Crab Salad 

Separate the crab meat into small 
pieces, cutting it, if needed. For a cup 
of meat mix a few grains, each, of salt 
and pepper with three tablespoonf uls of 
oil. Add a tablespoonf ul of vinegar, 
gradually, and mix thoroughly. Pour 
this over the crab meat, and with a 
spoon and fork lift the meat until the 
dressing is evenly mixed through it. 
Let stand until very cold. Dispose 
on a bed of lettuce leaves, and sprinkle 
with one or two tablespoonfuls of 
capers or olives, chopped fine. May- 
onnaise or sauce tartare may be 
added as a garnish ; with the latter 
omit the sprinkling of capers or olives. 

Bread Sticks 

Prepare the Parker House roll mixt- 
ure given on page 307 of the January, 
1905, number, but add the white of one 
egg, beaten light with the butter, etc. 
When light and ready to shape, form 



into small balls. Roll these (without 
flour) on the board, with the hands, 
until strips, uniform in size and in 
shape of a thick lead-pencil, are formed. 
Set to rise in a bread-stick pan. Bake 
when light. If baked in a hot oven, 
they will be less crisp than when baked 
slowly. Glaze by brushing them with 
cornstarch (cooked to a paste) when 
almost baked. The proper pan gives 
a perfectly round bread stick. Baked 
on a sheet, one side is flat. The proper 
pan is of Russia iron, and has depres- 
sions from half to three-fourths an inch 
across at the top. These pans can be 
procured of dealers, whose advertise-

Hot Waffles with Maple Syrup 

By Mary Taylor Ross 



WHEN one once gets used to 
making them, waffles are as 
easy a form of "hot cakes/' 
that complete a winter breakfast 
as one can make. With these the oven 
need not register a certain degree of 
heat. As soon as the fire in the range 
is fairly going, the irons may be 
heated, and the cakes baked, while the 
coffee is being made and the potatoes 
fried. If one does light housekeeping, 
and no oven is at hand, waffles are a 
solution of the hot-cake problem. Best 
of all, they are most healthful, when 
properly made, because they are the 
lightest and most delicate of all hot 
cakes known to cooks. 

One must, however, follow directions 
explicitly, or failure will result. After 
the ingredients are gotten together 
and before the mixing is commenced, 
place the waffle iron where it will 
slowly heat, and then, just before add- 
ing the egg whites, which are added 
last of all, to make the cakes very light, 
draw the iron to the front of the stove, 
and thoroughly grease it. It is then 
ready as soon as the batter is made. 
"The pan may wait for the batter, but 
the batter must never wait for the pan, 
or irons/ ' is a rule for waffles in an old 
cook-book. 



Waffles may be made with yeast or 
with baking-powder, but the latter is 
more generally used, because the cakes 
can be made in much less time. When 
made with yeast, they are more health- 
ful, tjut must be raised over night, if 
half a yeast cake is used, and four or 
five hours, if an entire cake of com- 
pressed yeast is stirred into the batter. 

Recipes for both are given below, 
besides one which may be used with a 
cup of almost any kind of cereal that 
is left over or a little corn-meal. 

Plain Waffles 

Beat the yolks of two eggs till very 
light, then stir in two teaspoonf uls of 
butter that has been beaten to a cream. 
Sift into this two cups of flour, with 
half a teaspoonful of salt and two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder. Stir in 
two cups of milk, and, last of all, the 
whites of the two eggs, beaten very 
stiff. Beat the batter before adding 
the whites with a Dover egg-beater 
for two or three minutes, then fold in 
the whites with a lifting motion of the 
spoon. By no means should they be 
stirred in, or the whites will liquefy, 
make the batter watery, and lose their 
power to make the cakes fluffy and 
delicate.

Cereal and Corn-meal Muffins 

are made by using this recipe, and 
leaving out half a cup of flour, adding 
in its stead one cup of cold cooked 
cereal or three-fourths a cup of corn- 
meal. Flake the cold cereal with a 
fork, heating it gently with a little 
milk, if it cannot be made smooth 
without. It must be free from lumps 
before it is added to the batter. 

Waffles Raised with Yeast 

Beat the yolks of four eggs till very 
light, and add one quart of milk. Sift 
into this sufficient flour to make a stiff 
batter, and with it one teaspoonf ul of 
salt. Dissolve one cake of compressed 
yeast in a little lukewarm water, and 
add the batter, stirring it carefully in, 
then cover closely, and set away to 
rise. When very light, add to the bat- 
ter one tablespoonf ul of sugar and the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs, which 
should, as far as possible, be folded 
into the batter. Set away for half an 
hour, and then bake in hot waffle irons. 
The batter should be commenced five 
hours before meal-time, and rise fully 
four hours before the whites of the 
eggs are folded in. When waffles are 
made with yeast, the batter must be 
very, very light, or the cakes will be a 
failure. The yeast -raised waffles are 
more work to make, require more time, 
and there is more chance of failing in 
the end, than when baking-powder is 
used. For this reason it is well for 
the novice to commence on those raised 
with baking-powder and eggs, and 
then later try the yeast-raised cakes. 

Egg-raised Waffles 

Beat to a cream the yolks of four or 
six eggs, according as they are scarce 
or plentiful. Add to them a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar, which will cause them to 
brown quickly, but will not make the 
batter sweet. Stir in a teaspoonful of 
melted (but not hot), butter and one 
cup of sweet milk. Into this sift suffi-

dent flour to make a rather stiff bat- 
ter, sifting with it half a teaspoonful of 
salt. Beat the batter with a Dover egg- 
beater for exactly five minutes, and 
then fold in the whites of the eggs, after 
beating them to a stiff froth. Beat the 
eggs till dry, before commencing to 
make the batter, set away on the ice, 
and, when ready to use, only a slight 
beating will be required to take up 
the liquid in the bottom of the bowl. 
Do not let these cakes stand a minute 
after the egg whites are added, since 
on the quick handling depends their 
lightness. The egg-raised waffle is sup- 
posed to be the most healthful hot cake 
known, and can be eaten by children 
or delicate adults wthout disagreeable 
consequences. 

Waffles may be served with butter 
and sugar or honey or syrup. They 
may be buttered and spread with a 
layer of jam or marmalade, two waffles 
being placed together, and the top one 
sprinkled with confectioner's sugar. 
Into the sugar a little spice, nutmeg, 
or powdered sugar, may be added. 
When spice is added to the batter, 
they become "Spanish waffles." When 
the grated rind and strained juice of a 
lemon - are added to the batter, the 
cakes are called "French waffles." 

When a pint of milk is heated and 
half a cup of the first quality of butter 
is used, the sauce or liquid that results 
being poured over a dish of waffles, 
they become "Dutch waffles." Or- 
anges or fresh fruit of any kind may 
be spread on the buttered cakes, or 
butter and cream used, with nothing 
else. Tomatoes, half a cup, may be 
chopped fine and stirred into the bat- 
ter, and fried with the cakes, making 
"tomato waffles." Half a cup of ber- 
ries, or any kind of fresh fruit that has 
been sprinkled with sugar and then 
drained from its own juice, may be 
stirred into the batter, making "fruit 
waffles," which are to be served with 
butter and confectioner's sugar.

Perfumes as Disinfectants 
It is a well-known fact that worker* 
among lavender beds seldom take in- 
fectious ailments, and those engaged 
in the perfumery trade are singularly 
free from them. A good perfume, in 
the old days, was considered an excel- 
lent disinfectant. The doctors then 
used to carry walking-sticks with sil- 
ver or gold knobs. These opened with 
a lid, disclosing a tiny vinaigrette box, 
which the physician held to his nose 
when entering rooms containing pa- 
tients ill with any infectious <" 



Culinary Misfits 
'I still insist, just as I insisted last 
said the gentle, patient 
mother of a large family, as she laid 
aside the well-thumbed cook-book, 
"that the 'household hints' we receive 
through the medium of the newspapers 
are rarely adapted to our circumstances. 
Provided they are intended, as they 
ought to be, as helps over hard places, 
they are of no earthly use. I don't 
want to hear that I can have a shiny 
kitchen floor, if I will take half a dozen 
large oranges, cut them in two, and rub 
the oilcloth and paint with the juice 
and pulp. I knew that acid would clean 
things before ' I left the cradle ; but, 
when I have half a dozen small oranges, 
I cut them up into tiny cubes and put 
them on the table for supper. And it 
does me no good to read, as I did the 
other day, that I can put together an 
excellent and tasty dish with the re- 
mains of a foie-gras pat£ or a terrine 
of foie-gras, whatever a terrine may 
be. If any foie-gras ever got into this 
house, there 'd be no remains. Nobody 
needs to tell me what to do with what's 
left over from ruffled grouse or chicken 
livers or shrimp salad, because we don't 
have them. What I want to learn is 
how to revamp the gristle and the fat 
odds and ends from a very plain din- 
ner, so that seven children won't look

The Original Fruit Canners 

We are indebted to Pompeii for the 
great industry of canned fruit. Years 
ago, when the excavations were just 
beginning, a party of Cincinnatians 
found in what had been the pantry of 
a house many jars of preserved figs. 
One was opened, and they were found 
to be fresh and good. Investigation 
showed that the figs had been put into 
jars in a heated state, an aperture left 
for the steam to escape, and then sealed 
with wax. The hint was taken, and 
the next year fruit canning was in- 
troduced into the United States, the 
process being identical with that in 
vogue at Pompeii twenty centuries ago.

The Grape-fruit. 
The grape-fruit, or shaddock, may be 
considered a monstrous orange. It is 
a native of China and Japan, and de- 
rived its name from Dr. Shaddock, who 
first carried it to the West Indies, from 
where it was first introduced into 
Florida. The grape-fruit is now looked 
upon as the ideal American breakfast 
fruit, and is being highly recommended 
by physicians as a tonic, it having a 
considerable percentage of quinine. 
The grape-fruit makes a magnificent 
appearance in a collection of tropical 
fruits, weighing often as much as six 
or eight pounds, its juice being subacid 
and very refreshing. The best grape-

Mrs. Younglove : "Our cook says those 
eggs you sent yesterday were ancient." 

Grocer: "Very sorry, ma'am. They 
were the best we could get. You see, 
all the young chickens were killed off 
for the holiday trade, so the old hens 
are the only ones left to do the layin." 

Mrs. Younglove.- "Oh, to be sure. Of 
course. I hadn't thought of that." —

The South Wind's Word 

By Cora A. Matson Dolson 

Our summer birds are far away, 
The winter skies are dull and gray; 
The white brook steeps, an icy thread, 
Between its guarding snow-piled banks, 
The rushes' brown and broken ranks 
Shiver against the North Wind's tread 

But in my heart a hope is stirred. The brook will burst its frozen bonds, 

From far I hear the South Wind's word, The willows wave their magic wands, 

And know that soon its fragrant breath The maple float its winged seeds, 

Will touch this shroud of seeming death. The blackbirds nest amid the reeds. 



And through the lengthened springtime hours 
This truth will speak in waking flowers, 
Writ there for sight of eyes that weep, — 

"All death is but a winter's sleep!"

Artistically Papered Walls 

By Katherine Louise Smith 



ONE of the. problems that con- 
fronts the householder with re- 
newed force each year is the 
proper papering of walls. Nothing 
seems more difficult to select than wall 
coverings, as roll after roll is unfurled 
for inspection. What should hangings 
be like ? A difficult question to answer, 
but color leads in the decision, followed 
closely by design and the size of the 
room; for the figure must depend on 
the size of the room. An important 
point in making a choice is to remember 
that water colors and etchings look 
better on a plain paper, and all oil 
paintings on small figures, though even 
the color of frames influences the tone 
of the room. 

A marked effect in modem wall 
hangings is the endeavor to obtain that 
delicate harmony of contrasting shades 
which renders the work of modern 
mural painters, like Turner, Walker, 
and Alexander, so beautiful. Another 
departure is the resemblance of many 
papers to the expensive hangings used 
in old castles and the old-fashioned 
pictured walls of colonial days. The 
craze for novelty has gone to such 
lengths that more and more startling 
effects are constantly evolved, and 
even the rag carpets of our grand- 
mothers are imitated. Many panels 



Don Qui 



n Salem House Wall Paper 



are made which resemble wood so 
closely that they are sometimes used 
in preference. In order to make the 
imitation perfect, the color is laid on 
natural wood, and the paper on the 
color, so that the delicate veiling may 
be traced on the finished product. All 
prices are paid for exclusive designs, 
and to such a length has this been car- 



43° 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



ried that a New York millionaire re- 
cently paid $7,000 for the design for- 
one room. $2 a yard is common in 
these days. In the Clarence Mackay 
home, paper was used that cost $15 
a roll, and this did not begin to com- 
pare with a rose effect copied from a 
French palace. 

Some of the most beautiful hangings 
are leather papers made in close re- 
semblance to Spanish and Moorish de- 
signs, with all the markings of age 
deftly added. Others are in the style 
of the German Renaissance, bearing the 
marks of the implements upon them, 
to show their hand-made origin. A 



motif of the room. Nothing can be 
handsomer, when the fittings are 
carried out in the same manner. For 
instance, a Louis XVI. room may 
have delicate -toned paper with a 
floral effect, and the upholstery be 
a brocade of the same order. This 
is particularly appropriate for a bou- 
doir. 

The idea of copying old New England 
wall papers is an endeavor to reproduce 
the decorations which can still be found 
in isolated instances in the country. It 
was a curious sort of wall decoration, 
in which the walls were painted with 
landscapes, trees, rivers, houses, which

noticeable feature of recent designs is 
that many of the styles are exact re- 
productions of draperies on old palace 
walls or patterns found in old New 
England houses. There are a multitude 
of effects under different names, such 
as Venetian, old Dutch, Turkish, all 
with fitting blending of colors; and, as 
these are usually made to order, ap- 
propriate furniture carries out the 



faded away into a background that 
represented the sky. Only a few such 
walls are in existence to-day. One is 
in Cherry Valley, N.Y., where the walls 
of the old manor house are covered 
with hunting scenes painted over a 
hundred years ago. Another is the old 
Perry House at Keene, N.H. Still 
others are in Medford, Mass. There 
are probably others in isolated com-

munities, where paste and scraper have 
not mined what ought to remain so 
long as an historic house stands. At 
last, however, we begin to see it is de- 
sirable to preserve these old wall 
papers; and the owner of one manor 
house had the scattered patterns taken 
carefully from the walls, the bits put 
together, and the whole pattern du- 
plicated for his new home. 

But such hangings are growing scarcer 
and scarcer; and it is for this reason that 
large paper firms in this country seize 
every available opportunity to copy old 
prints, and have produced such pat- 
terns as the rose and anemone design, 
which was taken from the walls of an 
old homestead in one of the valleys of 
New York, and the quaint Salem pat- 
terns found in old witch houses, and the 
beautiful floral patterns to be seen in old 
homes in Quebec and Montreal. These 



431 

copies follow the originals so closely that 
often they cannot be told apart. 

As a matter of fact, there seems ab- 
solutely no limit to the paper manu- 
facturer's art, for Watteau and French 
scenes vie in beauty with Olympian 
games, queer patterns for the nursery, 
and plain shades with a warmth of color 
that is marvelous. Another pattern 
copied from early homes in America is 
the Morris design. It is decorative 
rather than reposeful, and is used ju- 
diciously in luxuriant homes, where 
space is plentiful. The person of small 
means and owner of a cottage cannot 
hope to use this paper, but he need not 
despair, for a bewildering array of other 
patterns await his choice. 

Many designs deserve mention on 
account of their simple beauty. For 
halls there are papers veined to imitate 
green oak or mahogany, and these are 
rich when studded here and there with 
brass nails. For dens and libraries 
there are hunting scenes, golfing, and 
reproductions of Smyrna rugs that bring 
out warp, color, and pattern to per- 
fection. Other library papers have

as those in a cathedral window. For 
bedrooms there are dainty trellis pat- 
terns, where a net of vines climb through 
squares and lattices. In a dark room 
they impart a radiant effect that can- 
not be duplicated, unless in the con 
ventional designs that are broken with 
poppies, chrysanthemums, and other 
flowers. For small rooms panne velvet 
patterns are employed to match the 
upholstery, and rose du Barry and 
willow greens seem destined to have a 
long-lived popularity. They are pretty, 
but do not compare with other patterns 
that are painted in by hand with such 
careful manipulation that every stroke 
of the brush shows. 

Pew people know what care and ex- 
pense is taken by manufacturers to 
obtain new patterns. Most of the men 
engaged to design for a wholesale house 
are artists who rank foremost in the 
world of applied art, and some are fore- 
most in art societies. A tremendous 
amount of labor is involved in originat- 
ing designs for ceilings, frieze, and wall, 
for each must carry out the same colors 
and motifs. 

Coloring, in particular, has taken 
long strides in the past few years; and,

The Evolution of the Dinner Plate 

By Judith Giddings 



CHINA collecting is, perhaps, 
one of the most fascinating of 
the "foolish pastimes" in which 
a woman can indulge. We should all 
have our little recreations, regulated, 
of course, by individual inclination; 
and it may afford some woman quite 
as much pleasure to discover a rare 
bit of old china as it did Maria Mitch- 
ell to discover her comet. In fact, it 
seems as if we had quite enough won- 
ders in the skies, while the china of 
the old century is daily becoming more 
elusive. It shines, alas ! in muse- 
ums and collections, where covetous 
woman may stand and gaze afar; but 
in the home dining-room, where it may 
pass from hand to hand, where its 
curious history helps along good cheer, 
and its very cracks invite the homage 
due to age, it is too often wanting. 

What memories of summer days my 
own little cupboard holds! What recol- 
lections of winding country roads, of 
fields white with daisies or sweet with 



new-mown hay, of low, weather-beaten 
old houses, where I "visited "with great- 
aunts and second cousins, of whose 
existence I had been but dimly aware, 
till the desire for family trophies swelled 
my heart, and sent me journeying in 
the land of my ancestors. Did I not 
wriggle on the edge of my chair through 



long accounts of rheumatism and bur- 
ials, restless-eyed, but strictly sym- 
pathetic, placing a judicial value upon 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



434 

the very cup and dish hospitably set 
before me? I must admit it. 

The perversion of human nature 
seems to walk hand in hand with china 



hunting; and hitherto unknown or 
undeveloped tendencies to lie, steal, 
dissemble, and flatter, assert them- 
selves when the chase is at its hottest. 
It is with a blush that I recognize now, 
in calm meditation among my house- 
hold gods, that any "ill-gotten" gains 
are, above all, precious; and yet they 
but savor of the spoils of war, around 
which hovers the spirit of adventure. 

Collectors may be divided into two 
distinct classes: the real collector, 
whose time and purse are practically 
unlimited, whose motto is Rara et 
pretiosa, who can talk learnedly of 
glaze and paste and composition and 



sentiment than money, eagerly wel- 
comes the unknown piece, be it up 
to the standard or no, who despises 
not the simple floral pattern or even 
the "tiresome" Willow, spurned by 
the true collector, if it be that some 
woman of her kin cherished it in bygone 
days. 

Wide though the gulf between the 
collector's idol and the family heir- 
loom, there is still a tie which binds. — 
a tie, alas! which often proves a knotty 
one; for one of the greatest difficulties 
with which a collector of either kind 
has to deal is the unreasonable obsti- 
nacy with which the country woman 
clings to her belief that all blue is of 
the good old ' ' color blue. ' ' Abso- 
lutely untrained as she is, she becomes 



color; and the modest seeker after 
heirlooms, who, animated by family 
love and tradition, often, with more 



an exasperating stumbling-block; and 
vain is the attempt to disillusion her. 
Why a Willow platter is worth next 
to nothing, and one "almost the same" 
may bring a hundred dollars, is too 
complex a situation! 

Almost every family can produce 
a bit of the despised Willow ware, 
which seems to have been always with 
us, and is still popular in coffee-houses 
and lunch-rooms; and many of us, 
who know better, entertain a sort of 
sneaking fondness for it, with its fas- 
cinating story, — 

"Two pigeons flying high, 
Chinese vessel sailing by, 
Weeping Willow hanging o'er 
Bridge with three men, if not four.

Chinese temple, there it stands, 
Seems to cover all the land, 
Apple-trees with apples on, 
A pretty fence to end my song." 

For who will deny the charm of those 
childish rhymes which ring through 
the years? Old Mother Hubbard and 
Little Jack Horner quicken the pulse 
which the world's great masterpieces 
may fail to reach. 

China seems ever to have been a 
feminine weakness; for, as long ago 
as the days of Queen Bess, we find 
that royal collector vastly proud of 
her two pieces, a porringer of "white 
porselyn" and a cup of "grene." But 
china was not in common use till well 
on to the end of the eighteenth cen- 
tury. The Revolutionary War marked 
its rapid increase over pewter, which 
up to that time had been the approved 
table ware. To some extent the early 
Americans used wooden ware; and 
hand-made wooden trenchers, from 
which two persons ate', were used on 
the table of the colonists for many 
years. Wooden "noggins," or bowls, 
and "wodden cupps" are frequently 
mentioned in old inventories. 

As may be readily seen, these plates 
were not chosen with a view to artis- 
tic or intrinsic possibilities, but rather 
to demonstrate the evolution of the 
dinner plate in a single family, em- 
bracing a period of approximately 
one hundred years. 

Most of us know that the old floral 
patterns and nondescript landscape 
are of small value, save for the senti- 
ment which lingers about grandmother's 
days and ways. But that anything so 
frail should have withstood the buff et- 
ings of a century in itself lends an inter- 
est to the most inartistic piece. Fame 
is ever an uncertain mistress, but, as 
an almshouse is judged by the "powers 
that be" more fitting our approval 
than a bunch of posies, we yield, and 
meekly pass the posy to the back 
shelf. And the humble posy is not 



so bad on any shelf, either! For, 
simply as a bit of color, a glass-doored, 
chimney cupboard filled with blue 
and white is a most charming acces- 
sory in any dining-room, and before 
its decorative virtues even the "aes- 
thetic" sceptic bows. 

The oldest plate here pictured shows 
a simple pastoral scene, known as the 
"Sheltered Shepherd." Its color is 
the good deep blue of the Staffordshire 
ware, and its first owner began her 
housekeeping in 1805. 'Her daughter 
(still living) recalls no other piece of 
this design. Indeed, the early din- 
ner "set" was apt to be a limited af- 
fair, often helped out, as in this case, 
by an immense, round, turkey platter 
of pewter, which never dulled the 
carver's knife. 

Then followed a period of degenera- 
tion, when the fine old blues were fast 
losing their supremacy, and "mother's 
plates" were being piled up on the high 
shelf, to give place for the various in- 
ferior colors, — pink, purple, mulberry, 
and light blue. The second plate is 
of this period: its nondescript char- 
acter leaves little to recommend it, 
although the color is a soft purple, 
and it is of remarkably light weight 
for its size. Still, it is, perhaps, a 
representative plate of its time for 
common use, and interesting in its 
line of ceramic descent. 

A quarter of a century more, and 
the reaction had come. Company 
china, at least, was now for the most 
part unadorned, save for the severe 
gold band; and it was every house- 
wife's pride to own her "gold-band set." 
My plate of this period is not the con- 
ventional type, which was neither more 
nor less than its name indicated, dif- 
fering only as to width and glitter, 
but a pleasing deviation, which does 
not, however, throw it out of its class. 
Its distinction probably arises from 
the fact of its English origin; for it 
was bought in a London shop, and 



436 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



brought home to America in the early 
sixties. Personally, I have no affec- 
tion for the gold-band set: it does not 
invite the imagination or satisfy the 
eye. With what pleasure do we re- 
place it by the daintily colored French 
china, the favorite of the present day, — 
a substitution in which lies all the 
difference between the snowbank and 
the flowers of May. 

But the modern dinner plate is a 
theme of too wide a range, with too 



many charming variations, to attempt. 
It has become only a question of 
individual taste and pocket-book, a 
problem capable of many happy solu- 
tions. 

Above all, lend to your dining-rooms 
(if you can) that grace which cannot 
be bought in stores. Treasure up the 
memories, which belong alike to rich 
and poor; and, if you have not in- 
herited heirlooms, begin creating thera 
— for others. 



The Prosaic Side of the House 

The Hall 

By Mrs. A. D. Smith 



HOUSEKEEPING, with the 
prettier, softer name of Home- 
making, should not be prosaic. 
The very fact that so many people 
choose it and love it as a vocation, that 
so many words are written and spoken 
on the subject, goes to show that, like 
all subjects, it must have many sides, 
and, therefore, must be regarded in 
many different ways, according to in- 
dividual opinion. The object of these 
articles is designed to show housekeepers 
the small, often unnoticed ways, where 
matter-of-fact objects in the home may 
be regarded as artistic, where, with 
little money, the clever builder of the 
home may turn her house into a copy 
of the one belonging to her richer sister. 
To achieve this end in the most prac- 
tical and sensible way, it would seem 
best to take each room in the house 
beginning, of course, with the entrance 
place, the hall. In some old-fashioned 
houses this was called the entry, being 
in no sense a room, but only the place 
of welcome to the other rooms of the 
house. Then, again, there were the 
wide, generous halls of other styled 



mansions, where the hall made a path 
through the house; and now, in these 
our modern times, our houses either 
copy the first style, with an enlarged 
entry, or go to the other extreme, and 
have the hall a room of generous di- 
mensions, with fireplace and all the 
cosey aspect of a sitting-room. This 
method has its advantages and its dis- 
advantages, but, personally, I regard 
the housekeeper happy whose hall is 
like the second mentioned. 

A hall should be more or less con- 
ventional in its furnishings, though 
they may be bright and attractive. 
Many hall doors have glass in the upper 
part, and a curtain becomes a necessity. 
How often one sees here an elaborate lace 
affair, with a medallion in the centre, 
stretched over the whole surface, all of 
the coarsest design and in the worst 
possible taste; or, again, the little cur- 
tains are of lace parted in the middle 
and tied back with ribbon bows that 
look quite out of place, and should, 
with their saucy jauntiness, be tying 
up some little girl's curls ! 
I have a friend who has a house that 



The Prosaic Side of the House 



437 



is a gem of artistic planning, yet she 
has but little money, and many of her 
things are made of ingenuity and scraps. 
One of her friends calls her "Mistress 
Patience Pride," because so much of 
her handiwork calls for the first virtue, 
and the result of her labor brings forth 
the best sense of pride in her achieve- 
ments. So Mistress Patience Pride we 
will call her here, and as a model she 
will be a guide to us, even if we do not 
follow her methods in all details 

Her house is of the old-fashioned 
type, with a wide hall running through 
from door to door. Little windows at 
each side of the door required curtains, 
so she made them herself of common 
cheese-cloth. Upon them she embroid- 
ered green clover leaves in lustre cotton, 
and the curtains are daintily shirred to 
tiny brass rods at the tops and the 
bottoms of the windows. There are 
two little window-sills below, and on 
each one of these is a severely plain 
little red flower-pot, holding a stiff, 
tiny fir-tree. Of course she has a 
knocker. In the country always have a 
knocker, if the architecture of the house 
allows it ; but in the city do not affect 
it, unless the house is really old or there 
is some good reason for its presence. 

The floor covering in any hall is 
apt to be worn. I am not speaking 
of the homes of the rich, of course; 
but in every hall there is much wear 
and tear, and it is all in one place. 
Therefore, the prosaic carpet is more 
worn in the centre than on the sides. 
If your hall carpet tells this tale, take 
it up, and either stain or paint your 
floor a dark wood color. Rugs are 
more sensible in the halls of the average 
house than carpets, because they can 
be shifted and turned; but be careful 
in their selection, and have those of 
warm tints, yet not too gaudy. If you 
cannot afford to buy rugs, do as Mistress 
Patience did, — make them yourself, 
the old-time "hit and miss" rugs that, 
with little care in the choosing of the 



rags, will be almost Oriental in their 
coloring. Mistress Patience, to make 
them a bit different from usual rag 
rugs, bought some silken fringe for 
their ends. Upon her newel post is 
screwed a lamp of lantern design, 
twisted posts of brass rising to a height 
of four feet and ending in a brass gong 
from underneath which the lantern 
swings. This she bought at an auction 
very cheap because the glass in the 
lantern was broken; but it was an easy 
matter to have a glazier attend to that. 
So a soft blending of red and golden 
light softens her hall at night. 

She found, when she took her old- 
fashioned house, that the stairs had 
been stained brown like the floor. So 
she painted them white, and bought a 
stair carpet of a solid tone of green 
(let me whisper, too, that red is pretty 
in a hall) ; and, to give this carpet a 
distinguished air, she tacked it in place 
with large brass studding tacks, four to 
a stair. Rods are not really necessary, 
and are an additional expense, as every 
housewife knows. Her lower stair was 
very wide. So two lovely brass pots, 
polished to their shining point, stood, 
one on each side of the stair carpet, out 
of the way of passing skirts; and these 
held, except during the most severe 
winter months, two pots of blooming 
daisies, brought in from the pasture 
land. Pictures were hung up in the 
staircase, making it a leading place to 
civilization, v instead of a bare ascent; 
and here was a novel idea carried into 
practice. One little landscape picture 
had dainty muslin curtains about it, 
falling from a little brass rod just above 
its plain wooden frame. The light 
from a window above lighted it by day, 
and it looked like a little glimpse into 
a pretty garden rather than an orna- 
ment to a bare wall. It is a unique 
idea, and it is pretty. 

And now I may shock you, but the 
old-time hat-rack is an abomination in 
any hall. It is never a pretty piece of 



43»

furniture. So dispense with it. Use 
some sort of an umbrella stand, and 
bring into use a hall closet for overcoats, 
etc., if possible. Some wooden pegs on 
the wall, in an out-of-the-way place, 
will serve for a hat-rack; and, for the 
main article of furniture, use a table 
with a mirror above it. Where a room 
is not very wide, much appearance can 
be gained by reflection from a well- 
placed mirror. Have a table cover that 
is unique in its appearance, but solid as 
to its material. Try one of green or 
red denim with a border of conventional 
white leaves couched upon it. 

Fortunate is the housekeeper who 
has a mahogany table. Mistress Pa- 
tience had one, which was brightly 
polished and bore no cloth save for 
the doilies under the various articles. 
The central doily was of the design of a 
large spray of autumn leaves cut from 
£cru canvas, the edges finished in long 
and short buttonhole stitch in red lustre 
cotton. On this rested a Japanese 
china bowl for cards; and the other 
doilies under the smaller articles were 
single leaves of red or of yellow canvas, 
also edged with buttonholing. The re- 
sult was most artistic. 

In old English houses there is a cus- 
tom of having in the hall a small table 
filled with candlesticks belonging to 
the upper rooms, each with its taper. 
At night each person takes up his in- 
dividual candlestick, and wends his 
way to bed. In keeping with this idea, 



Mistress Patience had two brass candle- 
sticks on her hall table, giving a touch 
of brightness. In summer a vase of 
flowers and in winter a potpourri jar 
completed its furnishings. 

Beautiful umbrella stands are ex- 
pensive. So, rather than have a cheap 
inartistic one, she bought one of com- 
mon pottery, and painted it a dark 
green with a few fleurs-de-lis upon it in 
red, and it looks as if it came from an 
1 'arts-and-crafts shop. " 

In some halls that do not go through 
the house a door at the back will per- 
haps open into the kitchen or dining- 
room. In this case a screen is desir- 
able, and many pretty ones can be made 
at home that will be ornamental as well 
as useful. In summer-time I have 
seen a curtain of fine black net, heavily 
weighted at its bottom, at the front 
door of a pretty house. This serves 
the purpose of a screen door, and shows 
only a filmy uncertainty as to the 
room within. 

At best, the hall, unless it be a room, 
cannot be really a livable place. It 
should be conventional, as I said before, 
its few chairs or its bench or its settle 
of the hard, " forbidding- to-comfort" 
kind; yet it should have its thought, 
its motif, that it may be a keynote to 
the rest of the house. Next month we 
will consider the living-room and the 
parlor, and the best means of ac- 
complishing effective results within 
them with but little money. 



Little Gifts make Great Friendships 



By Kate Gannett Wells 



IT often takes courage to give little 
things, — a cake of maple sugar, a 
butterfly bow, a single rose of cheap 
variety, — lest the gift seem so insignifi- 
cant that it ought^not to have been 



given. Nevertheless, it is just such 
small offerings that make one feel she 
is remembered; and remembrance ce- 
ments friendship. 

It requires justice to self, to give in 



Little Gifts make Great Friendships 



439 



proportion to one's means and not ac- 
cording to one's wishes, and still not to 
forego the luxury of giving. The old 
proverb of not robbing Peter to pay 
Paul holds good in regard to gifts as 
well as to debts. It is very easy to say 
that another ought to give a good deal. 
Committees on raising funds often are 
peculiarly liable to this error by their 
ludicrously autocratic manner of an- 
nouncing how much certain individuals 
should subscribe, even to setting down 
specific sums against their names or 
by asking them to provide for an in- 
stitution in their wills. Many an in- 
tended legacy has been lost by such 
benevolent interference. Of course 
there are wealthy persons who are 
stingy. There are also hundreds who 
are generous. • 

Apart from valuable gifts, there are 
countless little presents that are worth 
much to friendship, and prevent gift- 
giving from becoming a drain on limited 
incomes. The obligatory gifts of social 
custom begin before a baby's christen- 
ing and continue on all sorts of occa- 
sions throughout life. Flowers are con- 
stantly subsidized to do duty in this 
way, from pansies, bought at nightfall 
as second-hand editions of their morn- 
ing freshness, to monster set pieces as 
emblems for all kinds of purposes. Such 
conventional offerings do not strengthen 
friendships, for no one wants to be laid 
under too heavy a burden of gratitude 
or to utter an interjectional series of 
"thank yous" while secretly wishing 
she had been let alone or that a different 
kind of flower had been sent. A sense 
of perfunctory obligation makes one 
awkward or annoyed. 

What is it, then, that constitutes the 
value of a gift, — its price, rarity, the 
time spent upon it, or its significance ? 
Should gifts only be sent spasmodically, 
when we feel like doing so? It is not 
always prudent to be an eaversdropper 
when a gift is received, lest one over- 
hear such phrases as, "Why on earth 



did she send me that?" or "Oh, dear! 
I wish she hadn't." Haw, What, and 
Why are the three tests in giving. As 
to the reasons Why, custom, policy, 
prudential motives, respect, affection, 
each alike indicates an honorable basis 
for the bestowing of a present, the one 
ground on which it should never be 
tolerated being that of hypocrisy or 
treachery. 

What one gives should be a matter 
of personal independence and income. 
Because one person can give but ten 
cents is no excuse for another who 
could give ten dollars. But, when 
necessity pinches, there should be as 
much economy in gifts as in rent or 
food. Many a woman is impoverished 
in her old age because, when young, she 
gave beyond her strength and means. 
There is lots of shamefacedness about 
gifts, as if it were ignoble to give lit- 
tle things. Christmases and weddings 
often lead one into unwarrantable ex- 
travagance, because one is afraid to say, 
"I cannot afford it." Such a person does 
not understand the Yankee charm of 
making something out of nothing, for 
it is the fitting of a gift to the friend that 
constitutes the real article, or, as the 
boys say when they get what they want, 
it is "O. K." 

Of course there must be fun in giving 
lavishly. Think of the prospective 
gifts borne away not long ago from 
Anglesey Castle at auction sales, which 
lasted 42 days of 6 hours each, and 
which disposed of over 17,000 lots. 
Think of a fur-lined, heliotrope silk 
dressing-gown, of brilliants with ruby 
settings, and emeralds with brilliant 
settings, for buttons ! Think how grate- 
ful one would have to be for sapphire 
links, the prime cost of which, it is said, 
was ;£ 11,000. Supposing one of them 
should be lost ! 

Things are very good to have as 
gifts, but that which is behind the gift 
makes for happiness. Much pleasanter 
is a long call from some one you love 



440 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



than a box of candy. Give a friend 
your time, sympathy, and the feeling 
that you understand her and are not 
in a hurry. It is the everlastingly being 
in a hurry that destroys friendship. To 
give one's self is much more than the 
giving of anything else. 

It is the way you give which makes 
for friendship. If condescension, of- 
fensive charity, or a sense of duty, ac- 
companies a gift, it becomes hideous, as 
when a lady said calmly, "I give you 
this because I ought to do so." A 
Boston bride received by the same mail 
a thousand-dollar check and a pair of 
garters, but it was the note which came 
with the garters that won her heart. 
Not long ago a woman died who had 
roused her coworkers to a sense of 
solidarity and union by giving as best 
she could, — a flower, a cup of soup, 
a tiny mould of jelly. Never did any 
one else make a box of gelatine so mul- 
tiply its powers of healing. 

Even more than little gifts, as pro- 
ducers of friendship, are words and ca- 
resses. Who ever forgets a child's kiss ! 
I/. E. Thayer wrote of his waking one 
Christmas morning to M a whisper so 
soft and low," as his child said: — 

" ' I'se nuflin to give 'oti, papa, 
Jes' nuffin at all but this'; 
And the tiny hands drew me downwards 
To the joy of a baby kiss." 

No father needs to analyze that joy; 
and yet a boy of nine, who abjures 
sentiment, wrote in disdain: "A kiss is 
just putting your mouth to a person's 
cheek and drawing in a breath in such 
a way that you make a little noise. 
That is not bad, but it does nothing in 
the way of helping you love the person." 
Still, we elders know the worth of a rare 
caress between friends and of being 



understood, not as one class studies 
another, but as one friend comprehends 
another's temperament. It is not merely 
the charities of Queen Am£lie of Portu- 
gal that have won her the love of the 
nation, so much as her giving up her 
personal luxuries for the sake of proving 
that she cared for the advancement of 
Portuguese women in all noble ways. 
She helped them to understand then- 
own wants, and to give such service 
was more to them and to her than being 
the only royal person who holds the 
title of Doctor of Medicine. 

We hurt friendship when we assume 
that it is too big for little gifts. Still 
more do we hurt it by any hitch, slur, 
word, or look, in giving. It is as much 
a fine art to give in "nickels" as in 
"muckles," and a finer art to give 
tactfully than to receive gracefully. 
The gift that to this day shames and 
inspires a wealthy woman was a bit of 
embroidery left at her door anony- 
mously by one who cared for her. 
Love, or at least respect, must surround 
a gift. 

Add to the little gifts that deepen 
friendship the great gift of one's self. 
Give time, service, and sympathy. 
Don't be in a hurry with friendship. 
Let it ripen, just because you do not 
make a five-minute call or sign a note 
4 'yours hastily." Have we no longer 
leisure for the gift of friendship? We 
do not sit down to talk with our sewing 
in our hands, for we have machines. 
We know five hundred people, where we 
used to know ten, and we go to com- 
mittees, when we used to stay at home. 
Surely, by and by, we shall have time 
to give ourselves, and then friendships 
will be great, cemented all through 
our lives by the small gifts of thought- 
fulness. 




Omnibus or Automobile 



By Helen Campbell 



cc 




T might even be said that New 
York is beginning to catch up with 
the Parisian cafe, — an approxima- 
tion, if not an attainment. That waits 
for some more nearly civilized future." 

The large tolerance of what he was 
at present called upon to endure was 
in both look, tone, and manner of the 
young man, carefully groomed, but 
the essentially tiresome product of such 
civilization as had been his portion; 
and the charming old gentleman oppo- 
site, whose eyes were keen and a little 
satirical, fixed them on the speaker's 
face with a look that said much more 
than mere words could have done: 
"Poor fellow! You don't know how 
much your sort miss. I am old enough 
to remember the day when cafes were 
not, and the little English chop-house 
under the shadow of old Trinity steeple 
was the sole hint of the many to come, 
while a little farther down town, 
toward the Battery, Charles Delmonico 
served his customers in quarters hardly 
larger." 

This was the thought, and now words 
came. 

"Beginning to catch up? My friend, 
it is omnibus and automobile over 
again, and I assure you we of the au- 
tomobile in our methods are, in some 
points at least, far ahead." 

"Ah I" the young man said. "You 
would imply, then, that a New York 
cafe can be ahead of a Parisian one. 
You will pardon me for thinking that 
impossible, and I must believe that 
you, who certainly know your Paris, 
are really of the same mind." 

"Ahead of it surely in all but that 
bouquet, that intangible breath that 
makes the glamour for all of us, save 
you blasi younger ones in a generation 
that knows everything while it is still 



in the nursery, and has no enthusiasms 
any more. As to the 'omnibus/ of 
course you know that that is the title 
of the embryo waiter, who, under their 
admirable system of training for perfect 
service, serves an apprenticeship as 
'omnibus'; that is, a general helper 
and waiter's assistant, getting this title 
from the 'carry-all,' or 'cart,' which he 
wheels about the dining-room and in 
which all the soiled dishes are placed 
to be conveyed to the kitchen. He is 
generally hired by the head waiter; 
and, when he has been made thoroughly 
capable, he is given a certificate from 
the Geneva Society, to which all trained 
waiters belong, and his name is placed 
on the employment list as one guaran- 
teed by the society to do them credit. 
That is a side issue, however. I have 
seen the interior workings of many Pari- 
sian restaurants (for I have always had 
a curiosity in this direction), and I can 
bear witness that they are far behind, 
in the adoption of labor-saving devices, 
and with distinctly less sense of the 
hygienic side of it all ; that is, the an- 
tiseptic quality that goes with tile 
finish. Our best kitchens now are as 
carefully kept as the best hospital." 

The young man's attention had already 
wandered, but the old gentleman turned 
to his neighbor, who was^ listening at- 
tentively, and who smiled as she met 
his intent eyes. 

"It is a little curious that we have 
fallen on just this topic," she said, "for 
this very day my brother has taken me 
over, or rather through, the kitchen de- 
partment of a popular Broadway res- 
taurant, which has nearly two hundred 
employees, its own electric plant, a cold- 
storage room, and its own laundry. 
And this electric power runs the ele- 
vators, illuminates, fans, and does 



44* 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



much of the laundry work, besides run- 
ning all the labor-saving machinery ; for 
the silver is polished by machinery, the 
dishes washed, the ice cut into desired 
size, and the ice-cream freezers turned. 
The dishes are washed by it, I said, 
but are wiped and polished by hand. 
It attends, too, to the ventilation; for 
the foul air is pumped out, and fresh 
air flushed through small holes studding 
the border, which defines the ceiling 
and side walls of the room. Paris has 
next to nothing of all this." 

''Madam," the old gentleman said 
with a look of admiration, "I am 
charmed to find that a woman has really 
noted all these things and seen, perhaps, 
what is the prophecy for the food sup- 
ply, in the near future, of the private 
home no less than for the public diner- 
out. When New York has landed all 
the inhabitants who persist in staying 
in it in twenty-story buildings, or even 
forty, it may be, the individual kitchen 
will no longer have space, but give place 
to the perfect methods of such as you 
have seen to-day, each block, perhaps, 
with its own general one. 

"Ah! but the dear old home-made 
things, the dishes our grandmothers 
have known and handed down to us, — 
will any chef be willing to allow us 
them?" 

"Any rational chef, most certainly. 
I was taken the other day, when in 
Boston, to the New England Kitchen, 
a small affair on Charles Street, but 
where what you call the home-made 
flavor in everything is turned out, — 
bread that I should call as nearly 
perfect as bread can be, and good old- 
fashioned dishes, delicate baked cus- 
tards, etc., and charming pies. In 
short, as good food as even the epicure 
could ask. Larger quarters, more of 
the automobile method, we will say, 
less of the omnibus, and you have the 
solution or a partial one of many a 
housekeeper's problem." 



"But an exquisite dinner like this, — 
the very perfection of service, of menu, 
and of decoration, which is just enough 
to fascinate and not enough to weary 
one as so much of it does, — must that 
go?" 

The old gentleman looked about the 
beautiful room and the table with its 
perfect appointments. "Madam," he 
said, "in the nature of things there will 
be more, and not less. Gross feeding 
is almost a thing of the past. Each 
day makes it more so. We shall con- 
stantly demand less and less, compared 
with the menus of our forefathers, but 
demand, also, that each thing shall come 
to us with its own qualities delicately 
brought out or emphasized, and be 
eaten with that slow enjoyment that 
distinguishes the epicure from the glut- 
ton. We are but just beginning to 
think out this business of eating and 
what it stands for, and I warrant you 
the generation next to follow will have 
better bodies, clearer brains, and more 
discriminating palates, all of which will 
mean better manners added to other 
good things." 

"I want to see it with my own eyes," 
his neighbor said, and the hostess, who 
had been listening intently, smiled as 
she rose. 

"I, too," she said, "but I agree with 
you. A great change is on the way. 
Will it come by omnibus or automo- 
bile?" 

"Both," said the old gentleman, 
"and plenty of other conveyances be- 
sides." And, as he spoke, he rubbed his 
hands softly, as the little party moved 
toward the great music-room for a look 
at a new picture just installed, and 
he said to the charming woman at his 
side: "Be glad of your youth and of 
the years that are before you, for mir- 
acles are on the road. Already I fore- 
see some of them,' and propose to live 
as long as possible, for everything will 
be more perfect even than my dream," 



Old Easter Customs 



By T. Celestine Cummings 



LONG ago Easter was conspicuous 
among holidays, and not the 
^least of its popularity was due 
to a certain air of mystery attendant 
on its observance. 

The first Sunday after the full moon 
following the vernal equinox is Easter 
Sunday; and April, as a rule, is the 
Easter month. 

In pagan days, April was dedicated 
to Ostera, the goddess of the morning 
of hope, and of all things young and 
fresh. Her home was in the eastern 
sky. To her the egg was dedicated. 
The hare is also closely associated with 
the celebration of Easter. The hare 
is believed by many children to lay 
all the beautifully colored Easter eggs. 

The lamb is a memorial of the Paschal 
feast, the Jewish Passover; and all 
sorts of legends are rife with regard 
to it. If you see a lamb the first thing 
on Easter morning, you will be most 
fortunate during the year. If his 
head be toward you, the greater will 
be your luck. Formerly, in England, 
the Easter egg was solemnly blessed 
by the priest, arid, being elaborately 
colored, was often kept as an amulet. 

England had many quaint and ridicu- 
lous customs for Easter, it is true; 
and, while we have scant sympathy 
with these, still nearly every usage 
that remains among us as a game or 
play was derived from that source. At 
Queen's College, Oxford, a herring is 
placed by the cook — something after 
the likeness of a man on horseback — 
on a corn salad, and brought to the 
.table. This is supposed to represent 
a red herring riding away on horse- 
back, and is a vestige of the once pub- 
lic pageants of rejoicing for the end 
of the Lenten fast. 

It was a habit in English towns 



for the boys, after Easter service was 
over, to run into the streets and take 
the buckles from the shoes of every 
girl and woman whom they caught. 
They could be bought off, however, 
for a penny, or twopence. On Easter 
Monday it was turn about, as the women 
chased the men; and, if the men wore 
boots or would not buy off by paying 
sixpence, their hats were snatched, 
and, to recover them, the sixpence had 
then to be paid. 

A singular custom was that of "lift- 
ing and heaving." A man would be 
sitting at home, contentedly, when the 
servants of the house would bring in 
an arm-chair, lined with white and 
decorated with ribbons and favors of 
different colors. The man sat in the 
chair, and gave each of the women six- 
pence. On a day in Easter week, Mon- 
day or Tuesday, the men would lift 
the women with attendant ceremonies. 
Edward I. was lifted from his bed by 
ladies and maids of honor, and for 
this, an old record states, "he was 
obliged to pay out the large sum of 
one thousand pounds/ ' Was this cu- 
rious custom a commemoration of the 
resurrection, or the survival of some 
heathen rite? 

In olden times, in England, monks 
at Easter acted plays in the churches, 
and the favorite subject was naturally 
the resurrection. Lists of the prop- 
erties in these sacred shows have come 
down to us. Heaven, for instance, 
was made of timber and stained cloths. 
The angels'' wings were made of thin 
shingles, and painted. 

The lights at these shows attracted 
many people. 

The great Easter taper at West- 
minster Abbey weighed three hundred 
pounds, and that in Durham Cathedral 



444 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



"was square, and reached to the 
roof." 

Not only were there plays given in 
the churches on this glad festival day, 
but there was dancing as well, espe- 
cially in the French cathedrals. 

"Even the sun," it is said, dances on 
Easter day. In Ireland, great prepara- 
tions were made for the closing of Lent. 
Holy Saturday, about nine o'clock, 
a hen and a piece of bacon were put in 
the pot to boil ; and at twelve o'clock 
there was eating and much merry- 
making. At four all rose to see the sun 
dance in honor of the resurrection. 



"But, John, she dances such a way 1 
No sun upon an Easter Day 
Is half so fine a sight." 

Wisely, in making use of existing 
pagan feasts and superstitions, the 
Christian Church, with its message 
of peace, gave to them a holier signifi- 
cance. 

The return of the sun to the earth 
was, henceforth, to symbolize the re- 
turn of the Sun of Righteousness; and 
the coming of spring, bringing the stir 
of life after death, was fitting emblem 
of the Saviour's resurrection. 



Thoughts before a Portrait of Raphael 



By Cora A. Mats on Dolson 



Above my desk hangs a pictured face, 
And I read these thoughts in its outlined grace : 
A face that looks from the centuries far, 
With the steadfast light of a changeless star. 

Though the brush dropped down from his 

pulseless hand, 
As he passed away to the unseen land, 
Yet he lives to-day in the hearts of men, 
As they feel the thrill of his dreams again. 

When the shadows lengthened adown the west, 
He looked to the hills, to the spire's far crest, 
The feeding flocks and the cedars tall, 
And the soft clouds floating above them all. 

And deep from the depths of his great brown 

eyes 
Would the visioned dreams for his paintings rise. 
Did his pure soul know, did those clear eyes see, 
That his work was for immortality? 

Nor you nor I in our hearts may know, 

In the coming centuries' ebb and flow, 

If the work of our hand and the thought of our 

thought 
Are on Time's indelible canvas wrought. 

Then pray that the word and the deed of youth 
Be stamped by the priceless seal of truth. 



For truth it is of the human soul 
That over the artist's canvas stole. 

Which sets the work of our Raphael's art 
In its master place from the crowds apart, 
As the Saint Cecilia's features stir 
With the raptured strains that were known of 
her. 

And the pure Madonnas that he drew 
•Keep fresh the shrine of the love they knew. 
While sweet in the Infant's face we see 
The depth and the breadth of Divinity. 

They laid his form by the side of one 
Who went to her bridal couch alone, 
The bride of Death in the stead of him 
Who had forged the ring for her finger slim. 

But it maybe that, when the Easter dawned, 
They vowed their vows in the world beyond. 

Yet what has he to do with Time ? 
And what has he to do with Death ? 

In matchless glory, still sublime, 
His paintings breathe with living breath. 

And down that dust-white way where moved 

His feet so long, so long ago, 
The birds, the flowers, the scenes he loved, 
A living Raphael seem to know. 



Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 



By Mary D. Chambers 
Lesson VI. Meat Stews 



A PORTION of meat weighing 
from two to four ounces is given 
.to each student for individual 
work. The various methods are as- 
signed in the order of seating, with the 
exception of Nos. I.f II., III., IV., and 
V., which are begun by the instructor 
nearly two hours before the class meets, 
the lesson period not being found suf- 
ficiently long to obtain the best typical 
results from the methods employed. 

Method No. I. 

Tough meat cut into (approximately) 
half-ounce pieces, and put on in cold 
hard water. Ths water is made to 
come rapidly to a boil, and is then al- 
lowed to simmer only (180 F.) for three 
hours. 

Method No. II. 

Tough meat in half-ounce pieces, put 
on in rapidly boiling hard water, and 
allowed to boil for three hours. 

Method No. III. 

Tough meat in half-ounce pieces, put 
on in cold soft (distilled) water, al- 
lowed to come rapidly to a boil, and 
then simmered only for three hours. 

Method No. IV. 

Tough meat in half-ounce pieces, put 
on in boiling soft water, and allowed 
to boil for three hours. 

Method No. V. 

Tough meat cut into one to two 
ounce pieces, put on in cold water, 
allowed to come rapidly to a boil, and 
then sinmered for two hours. Vege- 
tables are then added, — potatoes, tur- 
nips cut in pieces as large as the meat, 



carrots in quarter-inch slices, onions 
sliced or finely minced, — and the whole 
is again brought to a boil. The stew 
is then allowed to simmer for thirty 
minutes, when seasoning and thicken- 
ing are added, and boiling is resumed 
for five minutes. Lastly, the dump- 
lings are placed on top of the meat and 
vegetables, and the stew is cooked, 
closely covered, ten minutes longer. 

Method No. VI. 

Tough meat cut into half-ounce 
pieces, put on in cold water, allowed 
to come rapidly to a boil, and then 
simmered for forty-five minutes. Vege- 
tables, thickening, seasoning, and dump- 
lings added, as in Method No. V. 

Method No. VII. 

Tough meat in half -ounce pieces, put 
on in boiling water, and then allowed 
to simmer for forty-five minutes. Vege- 
tables, etc., added as before. 

Method No. VIII. 

Equal parts of meat (tough) and 
bone cooked as in Method No. VI. 

Method No. IX. 

Equal parts of tough meat, bone, 
and tender meat (veal) cooked with 
vegetables, etc., added, as in Method 
No. VI. 

Method No. X. 

Equal parts of tough meat, bone, 
veal, and veal bone cooked with vege- 
tables, etc., added, as in Method No. 
VI. 

Method No. XI. 

Tough and tender meat are used, 
and about one-half of each is well 



446 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



browned before being made into stew, 
as in Method Nb. VI. 

Note. — Water, barely to cover meat, is used 
in each case, the quantity being kept up as it 
boils away. 

The meat used, unless otherwise 
specified, is from the shin or shank of 
beef, as this illustrates best the action 
of the various methods employed on 
the gelatinous connective tissue. 

In a hard-water section of the coun- 
try, such as Decatur, the best results 
in making stew, as in many other cook- 
ing processes, are obtained when a 
mixture of city water and distilled 
water is employed. 

To THICKBN AND SEASON STEW 

Allow two tablespoonfuls of flour for 
every pint of water used in making 
stew. Mix with one-half teaspoonful of 
salt and one-eighth to one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Blend all with cold 
water to a thin paste, add to this a 
little of the hot liquid from stew, and 
then pour the mixture into the stew- 
pot while stirring stew, and continue 
stirring until the whole boils. 

Dumplings 

Ingredients. — Flour, water, shorten- 
ing, baking-powder, salt. 

Proportions. — Three times as much 
flour as water. One-eighth (or less) as 
much shortening as flour. One-quarter 
teaspoonful of salt to one cup of 
flour. Two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder (where a cream of tartar pow- 
der is used) to one cup of flour. 

Method. — Mix dry ingredients. Chop 
shortening into dry mixture, using the 
back of a fork. Add dry things to 
wetting, and mix very lightly to a soft 
dough. 

Note. — One-quarter a cup of flour makes two 
small dumplings. 

Dumplings are less apt to be soggy 
if cooked separately from stew on 
greased plate in steamer. 



To serve Stew 

Serve in large, deep platter, with a 
border of dumplings, garnished with 
cress. Or a piled-up border of well- 
boiled, dry, flaky rice may be effectively 
used, or a border of well-seasoned 
mashed potato. In the latter case the 
platter may be set for a moment in 
the "broiling oven" of the gas range 
to brown the potato. 

Varieties op Stew 

Ragout. — A stew to which wine or 
vinegar has been added in process of 
cooking. 

Salmi. — A stew of game. 

Haricot. — A stew of any kind of meat, 
cut into pieces the size of a haricot bean. 

Haggis. — A stew made of sheep's 
head and hazlet. 

Irish Stew. — A stew made of minced 
mutton and potatoes, flavored with 
onion and seasoned very highly, the 
whole cooked down to the consistency 
of mashed potato. (This is the "Irish 
Stew" served as a national dish in some 
of the best Dublin restaurants.) 

Kolcannon. — A stew of cabbage and 
potatoes, with the addition of fat and 
high seasoning. 

Chowder. — A stew of fish. 

Fricassee. — A stew of meat that has 
been browned either before or after 
making the stew. 

Corroborative Experiments 

Digest portions of fine-chopped raw 
meat in (i) distilled water, (2) a 10 
per cent, salt solution, (3) a saturated 
salt solution. Filter. Add filtrate from 
each, drop by drop, to beakers of pure 
water. Apply heat. (Compare with 
Experiment 6, page 195.) 

Questions 

What parts of the animal are the 
best to use for stew? Why? 

Why do potatoes not cook so quickly 
in stew as in boiling water? (Two 
reasons.)

' 'In boiling fish, the recipe gives one 
tablespoonful of vinegar to a quart of 



water. This is to be put into boiling 
water, (i) Is that correct ? Does not 
the boiling evaporate the vinegar, and 
cause its properties to be lost? (2) Is 
the vinegar intended to coagulate the 
proteid of the fish at a lower tempera- 
ture than boiling? (3) Why does not 
the vinegar gelatinize the connective 
tissue of the fish, and is this necessary 
or desirable?" % 

(1) Commercial vinegar contains some 
acids which are volatilized by heat, but 
it contains a larger amount of acids 
which are not so lost. 

(2) The vinegar, in so small pro- 
portion, would have no appreciable 
effect in coagulating the albumen of 
the fish. Some slight effect would be 
produced, it is true, but this would 
hardly be noticed by students so un- 
accustomed to close observation and 
delicate manipulation in kitchen woik 
as these students during a first term's 
work. It has been found more difficult 
by the writer to train students in habits 
of careful observation in the kitchen 
than in any other laboratory. 

(3) The addition of the vinegar, even 
in so small quantity, does gelatinize 
the delicate connective tissue of fish, 
thus causing it to fall apart more read- 
ily; and this is exactly the reason it is 
added. Note the first of the questions. 
"Compare fish with eggs and gelatine 
as regards behavior in cooking." The 
student has observed the fish is made 
firmer by heat, thus inferring the pres- 
ence of albumen. But the steamed fish 
keeps its shape better than the boiled 
fish. Therefore, some substance in fish 
must be soluble in hot water. Com- 
paring this with the fact that the fish 
cooked in acidulated water fell apart 
quicker than either of the others should 
stimulate in the student's mind the 
effect of acid on gelatine, exemplified 
in a previous lesson, as well as the effect 
of acid in converting connective tissue

COUNTRY VERSUS CITY LIFE 

THE season is approaching 
when dwellers in cities are 
turning their thoughts to the 
country, with its "sweet fields all 
dressed in living green. " The condi- 
tions of city life are steadily becoming 
more and more strained; and, in con- 
sequence, the need of a return to closer 
intimacy with nature and natural ways 
of living is more and more apparent. 
The massing of people in cities is 
neither natural nor wholesome. At 
some time a reaction must come. 
People are already longing for a simpler 
course of life. City filth is unavoid- 
able. In crowded places germ life 
of every sort flourishes: it permeates 



the atmosphere, is sifted alike through 
parlor and pantry. Hence the fre- 
quent and wide-spread epidemics of 
various disorders that are wont to pre- 
vail in city and suburbs. 

The question has been raised, — and 
it is not wanting in seriousness, — "Can 
one live in apartments and be a Chris- 
tian ?" It is said the modern, city 
cliff-dweller is shut off from at least 
three great spiritual incentives. The 
first is the spirit of loyalty, or patriot- 
ism. He has no home to fight for. 
The second is loss of sympathy with 
suffering humanity. He becomes cold- 
hearted and selfish. The third is lack 
of definite personal responsibility. As 
a preacher lately puts the case, in re- 
spect to the metropolis of the land: 
"The male apartment dweller can find 
no chores. There is not even some- 
thing to whittle. A man cannot be 
a good citizen who has no sidewalk 
to shovel. The wife can find few of 
those graceful and delicate tasks which 
make a house a home. The child — 
but I forget: there are no children 
in apartments — cannot become a junior 
partner in the family's enterprise of 
living, for living in an apartment is 
not an enterprise: it is a printed pro- 
gramme. It is dangerous to live in 
a ready-made house. As George Lori- 
mer says, 'Everybody's got to raise 
something in this world, — a job, or 
crops, or children, or something, — or 
else he'll raise Cain." 

But as the same writer goes on to 
say: "The truth is that the apartment 
house bacillus is losing its strength. 
New Yorkers, like the oft-cited worm, 
are beginning to turn. 'It is a cursed 
life!' said a father to me the other 
day. The city is furiously digging 
out its salvation toward the Bronx 
and across the rivers into Jersey and 
Long Island. The response of the 
metropolis to 'The Simple Life* and 
its author was fairly pathetic. Its cry 
is the cry of Dr. Holmes,—

" 'Oh for one spot of living green, 

One little spot where leaves can grow, 
To love unblamed, to work unseen, 
To dream above, to sleep below.' " 

There is always hope of the man or 
woman who is fond of earth and sea 
and sky, who loves birds and flowers 
and running brooks, who takes in- 
creasing delight in nature, even in 
all her varying moods. Such an one 
is not far from the kingdom of heaven. 



INTEREST AND ATTAINMENT 

YOUNG women are apt to look 
upon the preparation of food 
as an uninteresting occupation. 
They have been accustomed to have 
food set before them, and expect this 
will always be done. Housekeeping, 
in general, is regarded by them as an 
uncongenial and irksome duty, and 
they fail to arouse any genuine inter- 
est in its performance. Too often, 
moreover, the things they really do 
aspire to essay are entirely beyond 
their reach. Hence life in many cases 
grows dull and unsatisfactory. 

Granted that it is well to follow one's 
taste and inclination and to cultivate 
those things which one can do best, 
is it not, also, wise, at times, to do 
that which lies nearest at hand, and 
offers the least resistance to effort? 
The man or woman who can do one 
thing better than anybody else will 
not long want occupation, and, besides, 
he or she will soon be called, very 
likely, to assume higher and, perhaps, 
more congenial duties. Excellence in 
performance is ever and everywhere in 
demand. 

Our public schools, we think, are at 
fault in trying to teach very little of 
many subjects and too little of some 
subjects. Pupils fail to pursue a single 
branch of study long enough to become 
interested, much less proficient, in it. 
The remark is common: "I shall not 
take this subject next year, hence it 



does not matter much." They are 
constantly on the lookout for some- 
thing that will be new, easy, and so 
interesting, and seem content, provided 
they only get through. From an edu- 
cational point of view the results at- 
tained in our schools would be far 
better, we think, if fewer subjects were 
chosen, and those were pursued with 
zeal and diligence throughout the en- 
tire course of instruction. Proficiency 
in few lines of effort is preferable to 
inefficiency in all. " Because thou hast 
been faithful over a few things, I will 
make thee ruler over many things," is 
a saying deep and true. 

Mastery of the English language is 
the chief aim of all instruction. Do- 
mestic science, too, in some of its many 
phases, we think, should be one of the 
subjects pursued by every school-girl 
throughout the whole period of her 
instruction. Is not the subject im- 
portant and far-reaching enough? 
Whatever task one enters upon with 
persistent interest, success therein is 
assured. Interest in all that pertains 
to home life, to human welfare, is 
the one matter of immediate and vital 
concern to all the children of earth. 

WOMEN'S CLUBS 

THE rise and growth of women's 
clubs is a marked feature of 
the age. Every town of suit- 
able size has its club or rather clubs, 
while an annual meeting or confeder- 
ation of clubs is held in many States. 
The Federation Bulletin and the annual 
report of the Lake Placid Conference 
indicate only in a measure the charac- 
ter and scope of the work that is being 
done in clubs and conferences of women 
throughout the land. The direct in- 
fluence for good on home life of this form 
of endeavor cannot well be estimated. 
It is notable how many of the topics 
set forth in the programmes of this 
modern phase of clubdom are connected

with household science. Like Italian 
roads, all woman's ways lead to the 
home. Sanitation, hygiene, economy, 
household art and decoration, sociology, 
ethics, and euthenics, etc., all are in- 
cluded in the subjects for consideration 
and study in women's clubs. 

The following definition of what 
home economics stands for, from 
woman's view-point, may be of inter- 
est to some. In largest sense, home 
economics stands for: — 

The ideal home life for to-day un- 
hampered by the traditions of the past. 

The utilization of all the resources of 
modern science to improve the home 
life. 

The freedom of the home from the 
dominance of things, and their due sub- 
ordination to ideals. 

The simplicity in material surround- 
ings which will most free the spirit for 
the more important and permanent in- 
terests of the home and of society. 

Upon objects and aims like these the 
activities of the most ambitious worker 
may be expended. 

DOMESTIC SCIENCE A SOCIAL 

FACTOR 

MRS. ALICE P. NORTON, of 
the University of Chicago, 
sums up the social qualities 
necessary for success as follows: "Con- 
trol of environment, the power of initi- 
ative, a sense of personal responsibility, 
an appreciation of values that implies 
the ability to distinguish between essen- 
tials and non-essentials, an economic 
use of materials that includes the right 
expenditure of time as well as money, 
an appreciation of labor and of its dig- 
nity." In the attainment of all these 
qualities, domestic science is a potent 
factor. 

In speaking of household arts as 
handwork, Miss Helen Kinne, of 
Teachers' College, New York, says: — 
"Taking all its elements into consid- 
eration, cooking affords a most happy 



combination of experimental and con- 
structive work, with great social and 
economic value, where applied science 
is an ever-present factor and where the 
movements have training value not 
ordinarily appreciated. The expres- 
sion 'mere cooking,' not infrequently 
used by teachers of household arts 
themselves, shows a lack of apprecia- 
tion of the actual contents of the sub- 
ject, and is largely due to the popular 
impression that cooking is not a digni- 
fied art. Surely, its many values should 
relieve it of this odium." 

Efficiency, or the power to do, is the 
standard by which the educated per- 
son of to-day is tried. The time has 
gone by when work was thought to be 
menial. The work of the hand is 
no longer despised. Both intellectual 
and physical training are essential to 
highest attainment, — the best living. 
Civilization is advanced by wide-spread 
cultivation of arts and crafts. 



Of all factors in the environment, 
that of the greatest importance in pro- 
moting bad physical and bad mental 
development is, I believe, the food 
factor. — Dr. Robert Hutchinson. 



The day returns, and brings us the 
petty round of irritating concerns and 
duties. Help us to play the man, help 
us to perform them with laughter and 
kind faces. Let cheerfulness abound 
with industry. Give us to go blithely 
on our business all this day, bring us 
to our resting beds weary and content 
and undishonored, and grant us in the 
end the gift of sleep. — R. L. Stevenson. 



We spoil everything by hurry. We 
are wearing ourselves out as a nation 
by our hurry and intensity — too eager 
to get a living to be willing to stop to 
live. — Osgood.

formity to her laws."

diameter. Brush over with beaten 
egg after shaping. When cold and 
about ready to serve, make an open-

foie-gras mixture. Pass these to be 
eaten with the consomme. To make 
the mixture, use the fresh-boiled livers 
of two fowl, duck or geese, or their 
equivalent of pat£-de-foie-gras. Cream 
two lablespoonfuls of butter. Add 



the liver, pounded to a smooth paste, 
or the foie-gras; also paprika or cay- 
enne. For a change, omit the butter. 
Mix the other ingredients with the 
beaten yolks of two eggs, and stir into 
a cup of cream, scalded over hot water. 
Stir until the mixture thickens, and 
use hot or cold, as is preferred.

Purchase veal steak from the fillet, 
to get a pound of meat free 
from gristle, bone, etc. A 
generous pound and a half 
needs be purchased. Chop the 
carefully prepared meat very 
fine in a meat-chopper, put- 
ting it through two or three 
times. Then pound it with 
a pestle in a chopping- tray 
or mortar. At the same time 
blend with it about one-third 
a cup (three ounces) of butter, 
one -fourth a cup of thick cream, 
half a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash 
of paprika. Form the mixture into 
cutlet shapes, then roll in crumbs, in 
beaten egg, and again in crumbs. Fry 
in deep fat about six minutes. The 
fat should not be too hot at first, lest 
the cutlets take on too much color 
before they are cooked. If preferred, 
saute the cutlets in clarified butter, 
first on one side and then on the other. 
Drain on soft paper. Insert a paper 
aigrette in the small end of each, and 
dispose them against a pointed mound 
of cold, cooked cereal, shaped in a

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 

npHE productions of the different seasons and of different climates point out to us unerringly 
*■ that it is proper to vary our food ; and I take it to be a good general rule to select those 
things which are most in season, and to abandon them as soon as they begin to deteriorate in 
quality. — Walker. 

In France, elegant living to-day is marked by simplicity. There are fewer dishes, perfectly 
cooked and served. The right things are put together, and no digestive disturbances follow. 
Future study of the table should be toward harmony in variety. Even families living most 
simply should consider right combinations of food. Less variety in one meal, but more variety 
from day to day. It is no longer good form to serve a number of vegetables with meat. The 
French rarely put more than two things in a course. — Mrs. Dewey, in "Cost of Living for Large 
Numbers." 

WITH the fickle days of April 
comes a longing for a pro- 
nounced change in diet. 
The crispness of the winter air is gone, 
and the sight of heavy roasts, mince 
pies, or suet puddings, does not appeal 
to the appetite or cause the digestive 
fluids to flow. Something that tastes of 
the earth is what we long for, even if 
it be but the root of the pungent horse- 
radish. Oranges, pineapples, rhubarb 
in some sections, are now cheap and 
plentiful. Almost everywhere chives, 
or some other member of the onion 
family, lettuce, spinach, beet greens, 
and red and white radishes abound. 
But the prudent housewife says: 
' 'Fruit and vegetables are the dearest 
things in the market, and they are not 
nutritious. It is not right to throw 
away my money on these things. With 
meat at its present price I cannot buy 
both." As a people, we are learning 
to cull the best from the dietaries of 
all nations, but we have yet much to 
learn, and something, perhaps, from the 
frugal Italians. 

"Italian culinary methods have been 
developed in the struggle, when the 



cook, working with an allowance upon 
which an English cook would resign at 
once, has succeeded by careful manipu- 
lation and the study of flavoring in 
turning out excellent dishes made of 
fish and meat confessedly inferior." 
The ability to present these dishes in 
such an acceptable manner is due al- 
most entirely to a proper use of garlic. 
Thus used, it is called "the soul, the di- 
vine essence of cookery." Used prop- 
erly, it gives an elusive charm to a 
dish, so subtle that identification is im- 
possible. Costly? No, but one needs 
understand what is meant by its proper 
use. Garlic is not to form an integral 
part of any dish. A clove of garlic, cut 
in halves, is rubbed over the salad bow] 
or on a bit of bread that may be tossed 
with the crisp green leaves, thus shar- 
ing with them its acquired savor. Or 
a clove, in which a short gash has been 
cut, is put, at the proper moment, into 
the casserole or stew-pan, with cod, 
whiting, haddock, or with breast of 
lamb, rump steak, a fowl, or pigeons; 
and, after it has given of its "divine 
essence" for five minutes, it is care- 
fully withdrawn. Or, if the dish be a 



After Breakfast Chat 



463 



large one, it is left until the taste of. 
the dish proclaims to the watchful 
cook that the time has come that 
calls for its removal from the plat. 

Any one of these dishes will be a 
grateful change from the stereotyped 
roast, and then, too, a way is provided 
for a margin to buy fruit and relishes. 
But perhaps the most successful vent- 
ure of the Italians in the culinary line 
has been in the combinations of cheese 
with vegetable food. By this means 
dishes whose foundation is cauliflower, 
Jerusalem artichokes, celery, tomatoes, 
Brussels sprouts, beet-root, cabbage, 
potatoes, mushrooms, macaroni, cu- 
cumbers, and lettuce, are raised to the 
highest class, and made to do duty, 
physiologically, no less than apparently, 
as the piece de resistance of a meal. 
Such dishes are the hominy croquettes 
with cheese sauce, given in our Janu- 
ary number, the turban of macaroni 
and the baked potatoes en surprise, in 
the present issue. The Jerusalem ar- 
tichokes, served with the cheese sauce, 
mentioned above, would belong to the 
same class. 

You cannot eat cheese? There are 
varieties of cheese that almost any one 
may eat, if it be cooked at the proper 
temperature. Those who are troubled 
with rheumatism might find in some of 
the softer brands of cheese, delicately 
cooked, a food that might well be sub- 
stituted for beef and mutton, which 
often act as poison to individuals thus 
afflicted. At another time we will pub- 
lish other recipes that belong more 
particularly .to the Italian school of 
cookery. 

In making the Julienne soup, for 
which a recipe is given on page 451, 
better results will be obtained if the 
vegetables be cooked in a small quan- 
tity of broth, and this be thoroughly 
drained from the vegetables before 
they are added to the consomm£. In 
the pea pur6e served with the "veal 



cutlets, luncheon style," if canned peas 
be used, drain them in a sieve, letting, 
cold water run through* them. Then 
cover with boiling water, and bring 
quickly ' to the boiling-point, drain 
again, and press through a sieve. Add 
a bit of butter, a teaspoonf ul of sugar, 
salt and black pepper as needed, and, 
if dry, a little cream. Beat thoroughly 
while making the purfe very hot, then 
shape with pastry bag and tube. . Cook 
the parboiled sweetbreads in the oven 
ten or fifteen minutes, basting four or 
five times with rich stock, well reduced. 
Cut each sweetbread in three or four 
pieces, and serve one in each nest . 



We give in this number original cuts 
of two tables. The luncheon table 
needs no description. The illustrations 
of individual cover and centre-piece 
convey the whole idea. The Easter- 
egg souvenirs seen ^t each cover of the 
dinner table hold, besides glacd nuts 
and fondant bonbons, a conundrum 
written on a slip of paper. Cards bear- 
ing answers to the conundrums and 
attached to the eggs by alternate green 
and pink ribbons (green for the gentle- 
men and pink for the ladies) are 
slipped under the lace centre-piece when 
the table is laid, and are to be with- 
drawn at the close of the dinner, or 
sooner, if needed to settle the question 
of the proper answer. 

The dinner will be more enjoyable, 
if the mental effort be not too exacting. 
Such conundrums might be selected 
as can be answered by the name of 
some article of food, as "The earliest 
overthrow of the United States?" 
"Tea"; "Just escaped being flirts?" 
c(r)oquettes; "Dirt and goblins? "sand- 
wiches; "The emblem .of stupidity?" 
goose; "Dinah's favorite epithet?" 
honey; "Tokens of peace?" olives; 
"Cause for display of grief?" onions; 
"What the patient has.pjid the doctor 
gets?" Coffee. "Good for spinning

THERE is a kind of false economy 
practised in many homes which 
makes the very word "economy'' hateful 
to the ears, while the members of the 
family are made miserable in the effort 
to practise it. 

In such a home the lights are apt to 
be turned low, so that one must strain 
eyes and nerves in the effort to see, the 
heat is turned off from all save the 
living-room in winter, while the mis- 
tress is equally chary of the use of ice 
in summer. When even a necessary 
article is needed, one is obliged to wait 
so long there is no pleasure in its pos- 
session. This sort of economy is to be 
deplored, for it injures home life and 
hinders the development of character, 
which, after all, is merely a matter of 
the small things of every-day life, 
welded together into a mighty chain, 
which after a time comes to control 
our every thought and action. 

But there is another kind of economy, 
— a wholesome spirit of saving, — that 
which insists on securing full value for 
every dollar that is expended, and is 
careful about the small things, in order 
that there may be no waste, so that 
one is able to reach out after the larger 
things of life, — the things which make 
life worth the living, and that come to 
us as luxuries, the result of special 
effort on our part. New books, from 
time to time, a trip to the city, if one 
lives in a small town, an evening at the 
theatre, occasionally, to see some fa- 
mous star or to hear some famous prima 
donna, the monthly visits of a few fa- 
vorite magazines, the small sum left 
with the florist each week, so that a 



few flowers for the table are possible all 
the year around. More than one house- 
wife has proved that by * 'looking well 
to the ways of her household," and es- 
pecially to the small expenditures, it 
is possible to do these very things with 
the money so saved. 

Some of the little economies which 
seem too small to mention are the very 
ones wherein the penny* saved amounts 
to the dollar earned, and which makes 
possible many of the things which go 
to make life in the home nearer to one's 
ideal. 

A stick of solder, bought of a tin- 
smith for ten cents, will mend all the 
leaking pans, dippers, basins, etc., in a 
family for at least a generation. A 
small bottle of muriatic acid, having a 
rubber stopper, and clearly labeled 
poison, can be kept in a box with the 
solder. An iron is not necessary, the 
writer having mended many a leaking 
basin and saucepan by the use of an 
ordinary fire-poker, heated red-hot. 
Wash the spot to be mended by pouring 
a little of the muriatic acid over it, and 
allow it to run off. Do not touch with 
the fingers. A little solder can be 
scraped from the stick, or the poker 
may be heated and enough solder to 
cover the hole rubbed off and applied 
at once. It is all very simple, and one 
can mend any number of leaks in a few 
moments. 

For mending milk-pans a bit of putty 
will be found as good as anything. 
Soften the putty, and then push it 
through the hole, smoothing it down 
on both sides of the pan with a knife, 
and allow it to harden. This will 



Home Ideas and Economies 



465 



be found impervious to everything. 
Enameled articles that "spring a 
leak" may be mended easily by using 
the solder or by fastening a rivet into 
the hole and hammering it down closely. 

A little wood ashes sifted into a wide- 
mouthed bottle answers every purpose 
as a scourer for pans and steel knives. 
A little soda on pans will make them 
very bright. Very rusty knives soaked 
in kerosene and then rubbed with wood 
ashes become again like new, and a few 
drops of ammonia added to the ashes 
will materially assist in brightening the 
kitchen tinware. For a silver polish 
it is difficult to improve upon the old- 
fashioned whiting used by our grand- 
mothers. Wet with a little wood al- 
cohol, it imparts a beautiful polish, re- 
moving every trace of tarnish and in 
no way injuring the silver. A simple 
way of cleaning silver is to place a quan- 
tity of sour milk in a shallow pan, and 
then, laying the articles in the pan, 
well covered with milk, let them lie 
until they are bright and clean. Wash 
in warm water, to which have been 
added a few drops of ammonia, and the 
silver will be beautifully clean. 

While boxwood sawdust is undoubt- 
edly the best for drying cut glass, or- 
dinary sawdust, made very hot by a 
thorough baking in the oven when the 
kitchen fire is new, will make even the 
ordinary glass very brilliant, and an- 
swers the purpose of boxwood sawdust 
for cut glass. It is also very plentiful, 
may be had for nothing, while the 
former is rather expensive, if much of it 
is used in the course of a year.

Bitter Orange Marmalade 

(Honda, S.A.) 

Peel the oranges, cut in quarters, 
boil in clear water until soft. The 
peel then must be cut very fine with a 
sharp knife, — the more like threads, the 
better. Add the juice of the oranges, 
and to every three oranges allow the 



juice of one lemon. As many oranges 
as are used, take so many cups of the 
water in which they were boiled, and 
one pound of sugar to every orange. 
When all are put together, return to fire 
and cook two hours. 

Cocoanut Cheese 

(Bogota, S.A.) 

Take one pound and a half of sugar; 
boil till it comes to a rich thick syrup. 
When this syrup is cool, add the yolks 
of twelve eggs, previously well beaten, 
so as to be very light. Then replace 
the syrup and eggs on the fire, and boil 
till well cooked, at which stage add two 
cocoanuts, fine grated, and boil till 
quite thick, stirring continually from 
the first. When sufficiently boiled 
down, take from the fire, and stir till 
cold, when it must be pressed into the 
mould and left till the day following, 
when it can be turned out and cut like 
cheese. It is a delicious relish. 

■ 

To make Guava Jelly 

(Honda, S.A.) 

Pick and clean the fruit. Put on to 
boil in sufficient water to cover. When 
well cooked, strain carefully. To every 
bowl of liquid put about three-quarters 
of a bowl of sugar. The sugar is put on 
in water to melt. Then take the white 
of an egg t well beaten, and put into the 
sugar, to clarify it. Then put the sugar 
liquid to the fruit liquid, and boil till 
the jelly comes. 

Milk Punch 

(Bogota, S.A.) 

Five bottles of Jamaica rum, seven 
tumblers of water, seven tumblers ol 
milk, rinds of six large lemons and 
three oranges, two tumblers of lemon 
juice, and one of orange juice, four 
nutmegs, a bit of cinnamon, three 
pounds of sugar. Boil milk, water, 
and spice together. Put the rinds 
in rum, and let soak two days.

THE best coffee I ever drank was 
made in a large brown, mottled 
earthenware teapot of the style known 

as Rebecca , doubtless so known 

from the motif of the bas-relief deco- 
rating the sides. We were on an auto 
trip, and a breakdown forced us to 
halt at a farm-house owned and occu- 
pied by Hollanders. During our two 
days' stay I had opportunities to test 
that coffee, for it was served ten times. 
Bach day it appeared at breakfast, 
at ten o'clock luncheon, at dinner, at 
three o'clock luncheon, and at supper. 

I took it for granted that a French 
drip pot and coffee of the best grade 
were used. Our hostess, Mevrouw B., 
laughed when she showed me that 
huge Rebecca, and explained in her 
pretty broken English that she never 
paid more than twenty-five cents a 
pound for her coffee, procuring it 
freshly browned and unground from 
the city twice a week. "Her man" 
was very particular about the flavor 
of his coffee, and^she had tried pots of 
all materials and shapes; but they, 
one and all, would acquire, after a little 
use, a stale odor that Mynheer B. in- 
sisted he could detect, and that spoiled 
the coffee's flavor, — acquiring this odor 
in spite of a liberal use of soda and 
borax, combined with vigorous scouring, 
scrubbing, and scalding, not to speak 
of unlimited airings. From what I 
saw of Mevrouw B.'s exquisite cleanli- 
ness, I can easily imagine the punish- 
ment dealt out to those pots to keep 
them in an odorless condition. The 
Rebecca, being seamless, retained none 
of the fine residue that makes for state- 
ness. 

Mevrouw B. did not boil her coffee, 
not even giving it the "boil up once" 
usually recommended. The pot was 
rinsed, and thoroughly heated with 
boiling water. This was poured out, 
the requisite amount of fresh-ground 



coffee was put in, a tiny piece of dried 
fish skin added, the boiling water poured 
in, and the pot set on the back of the 
range for five minutes. The coffee was 
stirred down once or twice, allowed to 
"rest," as the little hostess expressed 
it, for a moment and then poured dir- 
rectly from the pot into the cups. 

Frances E. Peck. 



DON'T throw away the small pieces 
of soap, but save them till there 
is a cupful or more. Then put them 
in a tin dish with as much or more water, 
and set on the stove to melt. When no 
hard bits remain, add powdered pumice- 
stone or fine sand till quite thick, and 
pour into gem-pans or round patty- 
pans. A teaspoonful of either borax 
or ammonia or both can be added. In 
a short time the cakes can be turned 
out, and set in a warm, dry place to 
harden, and will be found very useful 
for removing stains from the hands. 



To the Welsh Rabbit 

Here's a toast to the frisky Welsh rabbit so 
gay! 
Most (eggs)cellent friend of our youth. 

He's been naturalized in this land of the free; 
And, in "chesing" (see Chaucer) to come o'er 

the sea, 
He has made us his debtors: in that we agree 
(Though we pay for the pleasures of youth). 
He's a peppery one ! His admirers all state 
That he'll chafe-in-dis(h)gust if they cause him 

to wait. 
May he never grow tough ! though he does stay 

up late, 

Enhancing the pleasures of youth. 
May he (beer) delight that shall never grow 

stale; 
No (ale)ments afflict him; his strength never 

fail; 
And all our descendants repeat the same tale, — 

Here's a toast for the frisky Welsh rabbit so 
gay! 

(Though they'll pay for the pleasures of 
youth.)

By Julia Davis Chandler 

1 ' O excellent ! I love long life better than figs. " — Antony and Cleopatra. 



€€ 



THE trees went forth on a 
time to anoint a king over 
them; and they said unto 
the fig-tree, Come thou, and reign over 
us. But the fig-tree said unto them, 
Should I forsake my sweetness, and my 
good fruit, and go to be promoted over 
the trees?" — Judges. 

It is interesting to read of figs 
in the oldest of books. Elsewhere 
in the Bible they are spoken of as 
being used curatively. There are, 
also, references to them in the New 
Testament. 

The wealthy Romans fed fresh figs 
to young swans and snowy geese; and 
in the palaces of the wealthy were fine 
cages for thrushes, which were fed on 
chopped figs and millet, mixed with 
wheat flour. By such delicate feeding 
luxurious tables were supplied with the 
most tempting and costly morsels for 
pampered appetites. 

While figs flourish abundantly in 
most of our Southern States, very few 
people try to grow them elsewhere, 
except in occasional hot-houses, and 
yet with some winter protection certain 
varieties will grow as far north as Phila- 
delphia. The branches must be pegged 
down and covered with leaves and 
litter. A tree in Atlantic City, N.J., 
bears well, which is housed in a cellar 
during the winter. The "farthest 
north" of the fig-tree is St. Joseph, 
Mich., where the writer saw a tree ex- 
posed to the cold lake winds, on a 
bluff ninety feet above the lake. It 
often bore fruit, and was mentioned 
in the Reports of the United States 
Department of Agriculture. For aught 
we know to the contrary, it may be 
living yet. The brown Turkey fig is a 
hardy variety. 



In California, figs have been grown 
for over a century. One tree in Stanis- 
laus County is sixty feet in height and 
covers a circle of seventy feet in diam- 
eter. It has a trunk that girts eight 
feet. This seems almost as gigantic as 
the Ficus religiosa under which the 
Buddha sat when he received enlighten- 
ment. But it is the Ficus carica, to 
which we owe the sweet mucilaginous 
mouthfuls we so incorrectly call fruits. 
Botanists say that figs are the fleshy 
receptacles, bearing fruits upon their 
inner surface. Minute flowers are situ- 
ated on the inner surface of these re- 
ceptacles, a few staminate flowers being 
found near the mouth. The fertiliza- 
tion of these by insects is one of the 
marvels of the adaptation of the ani- 
mal and vegetable kingdoms to each 
other. It was not until our government 
imported and colonized the fig-wasp in 
California that the fig crop was success- 
ful and began to rival that of Asia. 
These tiny creatures, the fig-wasps, per- 
petuate themselves on a wild tree, but 
vast numbers of the females enter the 
cultivated figs only to die that a crop 
may be borne. 

In the markets of Eastern cities, like 
Washington and Philadelphia, figs are 
for sale, which are grown in Virginia 
and to a limited extent further north. 
They are purplish, streaked with yel- 
low-green, and look very tempting, at 
only twenty-five cents for a quart box. 
Fresh figs do not taste like the dried, 
with which every one is familiar, but 
rather more like melons or the paw- 
paw. They are peeled and eaten with 
cream, or sometimes dressed with honey 
and brandy. Brandied, preserved figs 
may be made from dried figs by steam- 
ing them first until tender and then 



468 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



simmering in a rich syrup. Reduce this 
until it is very thick, and add as much 
brandy. 

In the store-rooms of Southern plan- 
tations, particularly in Louisiana, great 
gallon jars of preserved figs may be 
seen, rich and luscious, flavored with 
sliced lemons, oranges, or ginger root, 
and occasionally with the leaves of the 
true rose geranium. These geranium 
leaves are dropped into the kettle just 
before it is taken off the fire, and are 
soon skimmed out, leaving just a sug- 
gestion of their fragrance and flavor. 
This preserve is excellent with an abun- 
dant supply of hot waffles. Figs may 
also be preserved with maraschino ; and 
compotes of fresh figs may be flavored 
with kirsch. 

Old Southern housekeepers have 
recipes for spicing and pickling figs. 
The two following recipes are from the 
manuscript book of a Mobile lady, com-

Pickled Figs 

Five quarts of figs with stems. They 
must be half ripe. Put them in salt 
water for twelve hours. Dry, and par- 
boil in alum water, using alum the size 
of half a nutmeg, or put them in lime 
water. Do not break them. Wash 
in clear water and dry. Make a good 
syrup of one pint of strong vinegar 
and a very little water and one pound 
of sugar. Flavor with mace, cinnamon, 
and cloves. When the syrup has boiled, 
put in the figs. Use glass jars. They 
will keep for years. 

Fried Figs 

Take some large ripe figs, peel, and 
cut them in halves lengthwise. Fry in 
butter, and sprinkle sugar over them 
when dished. They are as good as plan- 
tains. (Mrs. Clementine Gazzam. ) 

From the Carolina Housewife, pub- 



lished in 1847, this for a pudding was 
taken: — 

Fig Pudding 

Fill a soup plate with ripe figs, peeled 
and mashed very fine. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, half a tablespoonful 
of wheat flour, and one teaspoonful of 
butter. Bake in a moderate oven. 

In "Practical Cooking and Serving/' 
a recent work, Mrs. Hill gives a novel 
recipe for 

Fig Pie 

Cook half a pound of figs, cooked and 
chopped fine, with the water in which 
they were cooked reduced to half a 
cup, and half a cup of cider, until 
smooth. Turn into a plate lined with 
pastry. When baked, cover with a 
meringue, and return to the oven, to 
cook the meringue. Boiled cider or 
lemon juice may be used instead of the 
uncooked cider. A little sugar may be 
required in some cases. 

Steamed figs, served hot with cream, 
are a favorite dish at vegetarian and 
physical-culture restaurants. For a* 
richer dish or preserve they may be 
simmered — the dried ones — in a rich 
syrup flavored with orange or lemon 
peel and some of the juice. When 
done, add a generous libation of wine, 
— preferably Port. It keeps well and 
is convenient in winter, if one has not 
a supply of summer-made preserves 
to rely upon. Conveniently stored in 
the sideboard, it may come forth, when 
unexpected friends happen in for lunch- 
eon or a Sunday night supper, and will 
be sure to win praise. This is called by 
some Figs d la Genevieve. 

A pleasant and nourishing substitute 
for coffee is made of California figs, and 
prunes, and wheat. When freshly re-

quality like any coffee, though it re- 
mains palatable. 

The ' 'fruitarians' ' of California make 
a true fruit cake, for it is all fruit with- 
out dough. They press evaporated 
fruits, with figs and nuts, into brick- 
shaped loaves, which are sliced for 
the .table. Figs are a desirable addi- 
tion to fine fruit and wedding cake, 
and are often used in fig-and-suet pud- 
ding. 

Figs are used with cocoanut and 
raisins in long "fruit bars" of fondant, 
and in many other confections, also, 



in much the same combination, as a 
filling for layer cake, either with icing 
or boiled frosting, and mixed with 
cocoanut, raisins, or nuts. 

A professional cook in Cincinnati, 
Ohio, when complimented on her fig 
layer cake, said that she stewed the figs 
in brandy. A superior Kansas house- 
keeper made a delicious filling by mix- 
ing the chopped figs with crab-apple 
jelly. No jelly of a very decided flavor, 
like grape or currant, should be used, 
she said. Plain apple would answer in 
place of crab apple.

into gelatine, thus leading to the correct 
inference that the addition of vinegar 
gelatinized the connective tissue, — ex- 
actly what this step in the lesson was 
intended to teach. The vinegar also 
improves the flavor, especially of a fresh- 
water fish; and, where there is much 
fat present, the effect on the connective 
tissue is minimized, — another fact which 
it was designed the student should learn. 
It was to facilitate such comparison 
that the two kinds of fish, the "fat" 
and the "lean," were subjected in every 
case by the same student to identical 
methods of preparation. 

"What are floated oysters?" 

"Floated" oysters are oysters that 
have been taken from the beds in salt 
water and placed for a day or two in 
fresh or brackish water to "fatten." 
By virtue of the process of osmosis the 
more concentrated salt solution within 
the body would pass out, and the larger 
volume of less dense solution entering 
would actually cause the oyster to 
plump out, gaining in size and weight, 
though actually suffering a loss of 
nutrients. For a full discussion of 
the effect on oysters of this method 



of "fattening," read the "Chemical 
Composition and Nutritive Value of 
Food Fishes," etc., by Dr. Atwater.

wheels?" rolls; "Under the Rhine?" 
pork, etc. 

On page 433 are shown a small centre- 
piece for an Easter table and a candied 
rose for a wedding cake. The rose is 
formed by pressing candied blush-rose 
petals, one after another, into a soft 
mixture of sugar and water. When 
used for a cake, the petals would be 
pressed into the soft frosting. To 
make the centre-piece, a pasteboard box 
about eighteen inches square was se- 
lected. On the bottom of this was 
placed a piece of looking-glass to simu- 
late water. When the shrubbery, cat- 
tails, sedges, grasses, etc., were dis- 
posed around the edges of the water 
or pond, sugar ducks were set on the 
glass, and a rabbit or two in the shrub- 
bery. The outside of the box was con- 
cealed with a ribbon and bow. The 
shrubbery, cat-tails, sedges, long lily 
leaves, etc., were made of angelica and 
chocolate frosting. An occasional su- 
gared mint leaf was also used. The fin- 
ished result was a very realistic scene.

Query 1004. — Madame G. E. L., Montreal, 
Can. : "Recipe for Russian salad, Vienna cream 
sauce, and preserved angllique root. What 
difference would it make if cocoa was used in 
a recipe calling for chocolate ? With what kind 
of meat would you serve sauce jardiniere? " 

Russian Salad 

Russian salads are of many kinds, and 
we do not know which particular kind 
is desired. A macedoine of cooked 
vegetables, or vegetables and meat, 
or fish mixed with mayonnaise and 
moulded in one large or in several in- 
dividual moulds of aspic jelly, is a 
favorite Russian salad. For a mixed 
vegetable salad, cut two cooked pota- 
toes and two cooked beets into small 
pieces, slice two onions very thin, cut 
fine the tender portions of two heads 
of celery, and slice six or eight olives. 
Mix these with mayonnaise dressing, 
turn the mixture onto a bed of lettuce, 
sift over the middle the cooked yolks of 
two or three eggs, and sprinkle over 
each end two tablespoonfuls of caviare. 
Decorate with the white of the eggs cut 
in rings, each centre holding a round cut 
from a slice of beet. Serve at once. 

Vienna Cream Sauce 

Beat two eggs and the yolk of a 
third until very light. Then gradually 
beat in three-fourths a cup of sugar. 
Set the saucepan into a dish of hot 
water, and cook, beating constantly 
until very thick. Then remove from 
the fire. Set into a dish of ice water, 



and beat until cold. Have ready half 
a cup of butter (freed from salt by 
washing), beaten to a cream, and 
gradually beat the egg mixture into 
it. Finally, beat in half a teaspoonful 
of vanilla very gradually. Pipe this 
sauce onto slices of lemon, as a gar- 
nish, and serve the same also in a dish 
apart. 

Preserved Angelique 

The stem rather than the root is pre- 
served or crystalized. Cook the stems, 
cut for convenience in pieces about six 
inches long, in boiling water until ten- 
der. Add to sugar equal in weight to 
the weight of the angelica half the bulk 
of water, taking by preference that in 
which the stems were cooked. Boil 
five minutes, then skim and add the 
stems. Let simmer in the syrup half 
an hour, then set aside until next day. 
Simmer again until the syrup is nearly 
absorbed, then remove from the fire, 
and stir until the stems become covered 
with the rest of the syrup, which crys- 
talizes as it cools.

With what Serve Sauce Jardiniere 

The term "jardiniere" refers to a mixt- 
ure of vegetables, and, while these may 
be» seen occasionally in sauce, they are 
usually served in a clear soup or as a 
garnish to a hot or cold dish of meat or 
fish, which is accompanied by an ap- 
propriate sauce in a boat, with, perhaps, 
in some cases, a little sauce, well reduced, 
poured over the meat, as a loin of 
veal, roasted, surrounded with little 
groups of cooked carrot (cut in fanciful 
shape), peas, turnips, string beans, 
flowerets of cauliflower, or such vegeta- 
bles as are seasonable. Serve Spanish 
sauce in the sauce-boat.

Query 1005. — S. L., Toledo, Ohio: "Are 
paper doilies the proper thing to use under 
punch glasses or finger bowls at a swell dinner 
in your own home? What is meant by 
double cream? Are service plates absolutely 
necessary when serving a dinner in courses?" 

Paper Doilies 

Paper doilies are more often seen 
under hot ramekins or similar dishes 
that might injure a choice bit of lace 
or linen. Usually, one selects her 
choicest doilies for use under finger 
bowls and punch glasses. 

Double Cream 

In the recipes given herein, when we 
refer to double cream, we mean cream 
of such a consistency as will beat (when 
cold) solid, with a Dover egg-beater, in 
a very few minutes. Such cream, put 
up in glass bottles, is usually sold in 
Eastern cities at fifteen cents per half- 
pint. The bottles are returned.

Qubry 1006. — Mrs. G. W. R., Boston: 
"How can the twist seen in German coffee cakes 
be obtained?" 



Shaping of Coffee Cakes 

Roll the dough into a sheet half an 
inch thick. Cut it into narrow strips. 
Place each strip in a horizontal posi- 
tion, and twist it by rolling it under the 
hands; drawing one end toward you and 
pushing the other from you. This 
twists the dough, and makes it longer. 
Bring the two ends together, and 
twist these new strips in the same man- 
ner as before. Then form into the figure 
eight or shape in a circle, then bring 
the two ends, side by side, up to the top 
of the circle on the inside, giving some- 
thing of a horseshoe shape. 



Qubry 1007. — Mrs. C. G., Albany, N.Y.: 
"How could a church party of one hundred

What could be used to decorate the room, 
which is very large? Suggest refreshments 
that could be served in four courses." 

Entertainment for Church Party 

A spelling contest, conducted in the 
old-fashioned way by choosing sides, is 
for a large number of people a satis- 
factory way of spending an evening. 
A library party or book reception, de- 
scribed in the October magazine, page 
197, though not new, is enjoyable. An 
extremely pretty way of decorating a 
large plain room is by the use of wis- 
taria blossoms made of lavender paper 
and fastened to branches of grapevine. 
These blossoms are easily made and 
very showy. The vines, also, when 
decorated, are easily handled, and may 
be tacked on walls or "trained" over 
doorways, windows, or booths. Cherry 
blossoms, also, are easily made of

" Boiled* Sponge Cake 

Boil one cup of sugar and half a cup 
of water to 240 F., or until the syrup 
will spin a thread. Pour in a fine 
stream onto the yolks of five eggs 
beaten until light-colored and thick. 
When all the syrup has been added, 
set the dish into cold water, and con- 
tinue beating until the mixture is cold. 
Add the grated rind and juice of half

whites of five eggs, beaten dry, one cup 
of sifted flour, and, lastly, the other 
half the whites of the eggs. Bake in 
a tube pan between fifty and sixty 
minutes. The heat of the oven needs 
be very moderate. The cake should 
not take color on the top until it has 
been in the oven about half an hour.

Query 1009. — Mrs. L. F. W., Ann Arbor, 
Mich.: "Ways of using portions of cooked 
meat unsuitable to serve as they are. Would 
like to use these for luncheon at noon, when 
soup is always served. Have 175 students as 
boarders." 

Ways of Cooking the Less Desir- 
able Portions of Meat Both at 
First Hand and as Left-overs 

In serving rib roasts of beef, trim 
off everything but the eye of tender 
meat. Around this fasten securely 
the outer covering of fat, and serve the 
meat, when cooked, as a dinner roast. 
Pass the lean meat in the flank end, 
and that taken off between the layers 
of fat, through the meat-chopper twice. 
Season with salt, pepper, onion juice, 
parsley, and a little mace, and form 
into cutlet shapes. Broil these or 
cover them with egg and crumbs, and fry 
in deep fat. Serve with tomato sauce. 

IC Scrag Ends " of Lamb 

Cut three pounds of the "scrag" of 
lamb or mutton in pieces two inches 
long and one inch wide. Saut6 these 
in fat taken from the top of the soup 
kettle, or in chicken or bacon fat, then 
stir in two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
and, when blended with the butter, 
add cold water to cover. Add also 
half a clove of garlic, an onion cut in 
slices, and a soup bag (assorted sweet 
herbs). - Let simmer until the meat is 
nearly tender, stirring occasionally. 
Then add six or eight potatoes, pared, 
quartered, and cut in lengthwise pieces 
the shape of a section of orange, salt 
and pepper, and let simmer until the 
potatoes are tender. Remove the fat 
and the soup bag from the liquid before 
serving. This may be cooked in the 
oven in a casserole.

ble dish, when well made and cooked. 
Serve at luncheon with a salad of cold, 
cooked, dried Lima beans, string beans, 
Jerusalem artichokes, or potatoes. 
Stews of beef, lamb, or veal, served oc- 
casionally, will be acceptable if well 
flavored and carefully freed from fat. 
These may appear on the bill of fare 
under various names, depending largely 
upon some slight variation in flavoring 
and seasoning. The dish given above 
usually appears, if highly seasoned, as 
1 ' Ragout of Mutton. ' ' A stew, cooked in 
a tight-closed casserole, to which, just be- 
fore serving, paprika in goodly quantity, 
and a little cream, either sweet or sour, 
is added, becomes a Hungarian stew. 

Left-over Meat 

Dishes prepared from meats left over 
demand very careful treatment. The 
process is one of reheating, and during 
this process the cooked substance needs 
be protected in some way from direct 
contact with the heat of the oven, fat, 
or fire, as, for instance, with sauce, 
buttered crumbs, egg and bread crumbs, 
pastry cases, etc. As such substances, 
when reheated, lose in flavor and juici- 
ness, these must be added to them. 
Broth or stock is almost indispensable 
to the success of these dishes. The 
more fine these cooked substances are 
divided, the shorter the time needed in 
reheating, and the more readily will they 
absorb sauce or whatever is to give 
them flavor. It is needless to add that 
all bone, gristle, unsightly or unedible 
portions, should be carefully trimmed 
away before cooked fish or meat is 
chopped or otherwise divided. On 
this one point the success of a left-over 
dish in large measure depends. 

Veal or Mutton Rechauffee, Creole 

Style 

Have a cup and a half of mutton or 
lamb, cut in thin slices. Cook one table- 
spoonful, each, of chopped onion and 
green pepper in three tablespoonfuls 



of butter until yellowed and softened. 
Add three tablespoonfuls of flour, stir, 
and cook until the butter and flour 
are well blended, then add a cup of 
brown stock and half a cup of tomato 
pulp (canned tomato pressed through 
a sieve), salt and pepper as needed, a 
grating of horseradish, and half a tea- 
spoonful of lemon juice. Let boil two 
or three minutes, then stir in the meat, 
and set over hot water to become hot. 
Pour over a cup of cooked macaroni, 
blanched, reheated in hot water, and 
, drained thoroughly. 

Veal or Mutton Rechauffee, 

Indian Style 
Add two tablespoonfuls of curry 
powder with the flour (see above recipe), 
then use half a cup of almond or cocoa- 
nut milk and two tablespoonfuls of 
currant jelly in the place of the tomato 
and horseradish, and serve with boiled 
rice in the place of macaroni. Half a 
clove of garlic cooked with the onion 
will improve either dish. Chicken may 
be cooked by either of these recipes. 

Other Recipes 

Croquettes, souffles, Snd timbales will 
not be passed by, if they be carefully 
prepared; i.e., the meat carefully 
trimmed and flavored. We recommend 
also the macaroni timbale given in this 
number of the magazine. The mush- 
rooms may be omitted, and other meat 
at hand substituted for the bacon or 
ham. The bacon, however, gives a 
peculiarly appetizing flavor to the dish.

Qubry 1015. — Mrs. C. R., St. Joseph, Mo.: 
"Recipe for finnan haddie with egg sauce." 

Finnan Haddie, Egg Sauce 

Select a thick fish. Let stand in cold 
water, skin side up, on the back of the 
range from half to a whole hour, letting 
the water, at the last, heat gradually to 
the simmering-point. When this point 
is reached, drain the fish, and set 
into the oven to dry off a little. Serve 
whole or cut in pieces. Arrange the 
pieces, one overlapping another, around 
a mound of hot boiled potatoes. Serve 
egg sauce in a bowl. 

Egg Sauce 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Cook in it two tablespoonfuls of flour 
and one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt. 
Add one cup of cold water, and stir 
until the boiling-point is reached, then 
beat in, little by little, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and pour over 
two hard-cooked eggs, cut in slices or 
chopped in coarse pieces. 



Qubry 1016. — Mrs. J. R. B., New Haven, 
Ct.: "Recipe for ham mousse and sauce to 
serve with it." 

Ham Mousse 

Have a thick slice from the centre 
of a raw ham. Remove all fat and 
stringy portions, and let the ham soak 
overnight in cold water. Change the 
water once, at least, on leaving it for 
the night, and use a large quantity of 
water compared with the size of the 
piece of ham. Drain the ham, wipe 
dry, and scrape the pulp from the fibre 
with a sharp knife. There should be 
a generous half-pound of pulp. Eight 
ounces (one cup) is needed for the dish, 
and a small portion will not pass 
through the sieve, and needs be allowed 



for. Pound the ham pulp with a 
pestle in a mortar or wooden bowl. 
When smooth, add the beaten whites 
of two eggs, and pound the whole until 
again smooth. Have ready a sauce 
made of two tablespoonfuls, each, of 
butter and flour, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful, each, of salt and paprika, and one 
cup of chicken stock (broth seasoned 
with onion, carrot, celery, bay leaf, 
etc.). When the sauce is cold, beat 
this smoothly into the ham mixture, 
and press the whole through a pur6e 
sieve. Beat in the yolks of two eggs, 
beaten very light, and one cup of cream, 
beaten firm. Add more seasoning, if 
needed, and turn the mixture into a 
thoroughly buttered mould. Cook, set 
on several folds of paper and sur- 
rounded with hot water, until firm to 
the touch (twenty-five or thirty min- 
utes). Serve with a pint of sauce made 
of chicken broth and roux in the usual 
proportions, flavore4 with two table- 
spoonfuls of Madeira. Do not add the 
wine until after the sauce is taken from 
the fire. Or serve with the brown to- 
mato sauce given on page 455. 

Qubry 1017. — C. N., Pinehurst, N.C. : "Rec- 
ipe for candied yams." 

Candied Yams 

Lay pared sweet potatoes or yams, 
cut in halves, in a casserole or baking- 
dish with a cover. Sprinkle each layer 
with sugar (maple sugar is the best), salt 
and pepper or cinnamon, and dot with 
bits of butter. Pour in half a cup (for 
half a dozen potatoes) of boiling water, 
and bake until tender. Remove the 
cover, and baste the potatoes occa- 
sionally with the liquid in the dish. 
The heat needs be moderate.

Rice Griddle-cakes 

Blanch half a cup of rice. Add a

boiling water, and let cook until the 
rice is very tender. Press through a 
sieve or ricer, and set aside for use, 
when needed. The rice should be, 
when cold, in a semi-liquid state. To 
one cup and a half of this (if too firm, 
add milk to make of the right consist- 
ency) add half a teaspoonful of salt, 
the beaten yolks of two eggs, one cup 
of flour, sifted again with two level 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, and, 
when well mixed, the whites of two 
eggs, beaten dry. Bake as any griddle- 
cakes. By adding another egg t less 
flour may be used. Flour is the only 
ingredient in the cakes that requires 
much cooking; and, as griddle-cakes 
are baked very quickly, it is well to 
eliminate uncooked flour as much as 
possible. 

Rice-and- Indian Meal Cakes 

Pass together through a sieve half a 
cup, each, of flour and corn-meal, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, and two and a 
half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder. 
Add to one cup of boiled rice, so cooked 
that the grains are distinct, with the 
beaten yolks of two eggs and one cup 
of milk. Mix thoroughly, then add 
the whites of two eggs, beaten dry, and 
bake on a hot, well-oiled griddle. Let 
the half-cup of flour be of generous 
measure. 



Query 1 019. — A. H., Harlem, N.Y.: "How 
clarify butter for use in frying oysters and 
as a sauce for asparagus, etc. In using a 
casserole, do you place it on top of the stove 
or in the oven ? What is a carpel of an orange ? 
In putting mince meat in store for future use, 
is the suet cooked or not?" 

To clarify Butter 

Put half a pound of butter in a sauce- 
pan over a slow fire. Let melt, and boil 
very gently. Skim occasionally, but 
do not let the butter discolor from too 
much heat. In about half an hour 
pour the clear liquid from the sedi-

Heredity 

Can be overcome in Cases 

The influence of heredity cannot, of 
course, be successfully disputed, but it 
can be minimized or entirely overcome 
in some cases by correct food and drink. 
A Connecticut lady says: — 

"For years, while I was a coffee 
drinker, I suffered from bilious attacks 
of great severity, from which I used to 
emerge as white as a ghost and very 
weak. Our family physician gave me 
various prescriptions for improving the 
digestion and stimulating the liver, 
which I tried faithfully, but without 
perceptible result. He was acquainted 
with my family history for several 
generations bade, and once, when I 
visited him, he said: 'If you have in- 
herited one of those torpid livers, you 
may always suffer more or less from its 
inaction. We can't dodge our inheri- 
tance, you know.' 

4 'I was not so strong a believer in 
heredity as he was, however, and, be- 
ginning to think for myself, I concluded 
to stop drinking coffee, and see what 
effect that would have. I feared it 
would be a severe trial to give it up; 
but, when I took Postum and had it 
weH made, it completely filled my need 
for a hot beverage, and I grew very 
fond of it. 

"I have used the Postum Coffee for 
three years, using no medicine, and the 
change has completely cured me. Dur- 
ing all that time I have had absolutely 
none of the bilious attacks that I used 
to suffer from, and I have been entirely 
free from the pain and debilitating 
effects that used to result from them. 
The change is surely very great, and 
I am compelled to give Postum Coffee 
the exclusive credit for it." Name 
given by Postum Company, Battle 
Creek, Mich. 

There's a reason.

Using a Casserole 

Casseroles are used either on the top 
of the range or in the oven. Direc- 
tions are often given to saute: the meat 
and vegetables in the casserole until 
browned, then add stock, and cook, 
covered, in the oven. Earthen casse- 
roles stand the heat pretty well, but, as 
very strong heat is needed to brown 
anything, it would seem preferable to 
brown the articles in a frying-pan, then 
transfer them to the casserole, to finish 
the cooking with more moderate heat, 
either on top of the range or in the oven. 

Orange Carpel 

A single section of an orange is called 
a carpel ; that is, a section of pulp en- 
closed in fibrous membrane.

Pressed Chicken 

Cover a young fowl, separated at the 
joints, with boiling water, and let 
simmer until tender, with a few slices 
of carrot, half an onion, half a bay leaf, 
and a stalk of celery. Remove the 
skin and bones, and return these in the 
broth to the fire, and let simmer until 
the broth is reduced to a generous cup- 
ful. Strain this, and set aside. Cut 
the meat (when cold) into tiny cubes 
or chop fine. Remove the fat from the 
broth, heat to the boiling-point, and 
stir the chicken into it, adding salt and 
pepper and other seasoning, if wished. 
Turn the mixture into an earthen bowl, 
decorated with hard-boiled eggs cut in 
slices, and capers or sliced olives. 
Cover with a buttered paper bearing a

Its Food 

That restores and makes Health possible 

There are stomach specialists as well 
as eye and ear and other specialists. 

One of these told a young lady of 
New Brunswick, N.J., to quit medicines 
and eat Grape-nuts. She says: — 

"For about twelve months I suffered 
severely with gastritis. I was unable 
to retain much of anything on my 
stomach, and consequently was com- 
pelled to give up my occupation. I 
took quantities of medicine, and had 
an idea I was dieting, but I continued 
to suffer, and soon lost fifteen pounds 
in weight. I was depressed in spirits, 
and lost interest in everything generally. 
My mind was so affected that it was 
impossible to become interested in even 
the lightest reading matter. 

"After suffering for months I de- 
cided to go to a stomach specialist. 
He put me on Grape-nuts, and my 
health began to improve immediately. 
It was the keynote of a new life. I 
found that I had been eating too much 
starchy food, which I did not digest, 
and that the cereals which I had tried 
had been too heavy. I soon proved 
that it is not the quantity of food that 
one eats, but the quality. 

" In a few weeks I was able to go back 
to my old business of doing clerical 
work. I have continued to eat Grape- 
nuts for both the morning and evening 
meal. I wake in the morning with a 
clear mind, and feel rested. I regained 
my lost weight in a short time. I am 
well and happy again, and owe it to 
Grape-nuts." Name given by Postum 
Company, Battle Creek, Mich.

The Letters op Theodora. By Ade- 
laide L. Rouse. Cloth, i2mo. Price 
$1.50. New York: The Macmillan 
Company. 

These letters are interesting, read- 
able, even delightful. The reader be- 
comes absorbed in the fortunes of 
Theodora Varney, a very modern young 
woman, with ambition, literary taste, 
and a very taking style of expression, 
who has abandoned teaching and aspires 
to independence and fame as an author. 
Her story is told and her womanly 
character is revealed in these sixty 
letters to intimate friends, not one of 
which is dull in content or irrelevant 
to the development of a most interest- 
ing character. Of course, in process of 
time T. V. becomes Theodora Gilchrist; 
but no one would have had it otherwise. 
The letters are bright, true to life, 
and charming in sentiment. Young 
and old cannot fail to take delight in 
their perusal. 

Uncooked Foods and How to use 
Them. By Mr. and Mrs. Eugene 
Christian. 250 pages. i2mo. Cloth. 
Price $1.00. New York: The Health 
Culture Company. 

This volume considers the diet ques- 
tion from rather an extraordinary point 
of view. The authors claim that the ap- 
plication of heat in the cooking of food 
destroys some of the important food 
elements that are vital and organic by 
rendering them inorganic, including 
those that are needed in the building up 
of the system and the maintenance of 
bodily and mental health. They claim. 



also, that the doing away with cooking 
would emancipate woman, in a degree 
at least, from the thraldom of the 
kitchen and the cook-stove. 

If it be true that "in diet lies the 
key to nine-tenths of the social and 
political problems that vex our age 
and time," this book is of concern to 
large numbers of people. It will in- 
terest especially those who are dis- 
satisfied with prevailing methods of 
cooking and are looking for radical re- 
form in diet. It may show others the 
desirability of a somewhat modified 
form of diet. At the same time we 
are aware reforms are plants of slow 
growth. The subject of diet is worthy 
of the most thoughtful study and at- 
tention. "The most important thing 
that can engage the thoughts of man- 
kind is how to build the human body, 
how to bring to their highest develop- 
ment all its faculties. This must de- 
pend upon something, must be made of 
something. That something is food."

For Easter Blooms 

By Mrs. E. M. Lucas 



DAINTY and sweet, the Roman 
hyacinth is the quintessence 
of fragile beauty among bulbs, 
and there is less art in growing this 
hyacinth than any other flower of 
equally choice and exquisite properties. 

The pure white, with its frost-like 
delicacy, exceeds other varieties in 
beauty, though the pale yellow Roman 
hyacinth, introduced in recent years, 
is charming, and justly considered a 
floral acquisition. The shade of yellow 
is yet very light, and not what is meant 
by the term as applied to daffodils of 
genuine chrome yellow. 

The pink and blue shades, both light 
and dark, are very clear and pretty, 
and in single form, as all the class are. 

The faculty of producing more than 
one bloom stalk, sometimes as many 
as four, but almost certainly two, is 
peculiar to this beautiful hyacinth. 

The culture is simple, if certain rules 
are observed. 

January is the best time for starting 
bulbs for Easter. More failures, with 
amateurs, result from rushing bulbs 
with unformed roots into light and heat 
than perhaps from any other cause. 

The very first consideration with 



bulbs to be forced into bloom is to 
allow the roots time to form leisurely. 
This is done by darkening the pots con- 
taining the bulbs. Cover them with 
old rugs, and place in a darkened but 
not cold place for five or six weeks. 
Then bring to the light, but not to full 
sunshine, as the flower stalks are 
thereby urged too rapidly into activity, 
and the result is a weak spike, with 
blossoms open before the stem has fairly 
left the bulb. 

Bring to the warmth gradually, al- 
though these hyacinths prefer a cool 
temperature to perfect their develop- 
ment. 

Moisture is necessary while the roots 
are forming, but do not keep the soil 
in a saturated condition. Good drain- 
age is essential. This is accomplished 
by placing a few bits of broken brick in 
the bottom of the pot, or a single large 
piece of broken pottery, placing it over 
the drainage hole. 

Make the soil rich, but not with fresh 
or stimulating fertilizers, as this would 
induce decay of the bulbs. Thoroughly 
decomposed, friable compost, strong 
loam, leaf mould from the woods (fail-, 
ing the last named, chopped sphagnum

moss is an excellent substitute), with 
an intermixture of sand to make the 
soil porous, have strong elements of 
soluble plant food. 

In potting, use about two-fourths 
loam to one-fourth sphagnum moss or 
leaf mould and one-fourth sand, putting 
a handful of clear sand directly under 
the base of bulb for the young roots to 
form in. 

This hyacinth has a very strong root 
growth, and, when in full vigor, will 
push the bulb up out of the soil. There- 
fore, set it deep in the pot; and, when it 
rises an inch or so, fill around and over 
with fresh soil. 

Shallow boxes filled with bulbs of 
Roman hyacinths, set closely together, 
will be masses of green leafage and 
dainty blossoms, completely covering 
the soil from sight, and filling the apart- 
ment with perfume that is delicate and 
suggestive of spring and its joyous re- 
newing. These boxes may be gleaned 
for weeks, and the general effect will 
not be marred, as, unlike some bulbs, 
when every flower culled will leave- a 
vacancy, the number of blooms to each 
of these bulbs admits of much cutting, 
still leaving a full quota in bloom. This 
is a decided feature in favor of this 
bulb, especially for Easter, when flowers 
are in demand. 

A basket composed of braided boughs 
of willow, with the pretty silvery cat 5 
kins left on, and filled with Roman 
hyacinths, is a mass of delicate sweet- 
ness and beauty that forms an accept- 
able Easter gift. 



An Easter Pastoral 

By Ella E. Rockwood 

Across the bare brown fields we see 

A tinge of wakening green ; 
Soft blows the noontide breeze across 

The water's silvery sheen. 
The evening sky glows bright and fair, 

Sweet songsters' voices ring, 
With swelling buds all Nature joins 

An Easter psalm to sing.

The Bread of the Boers 
About every district in the Trans- 
vaal boasts its mill, and sometimes 
more than one, invariably doing a good 
business. Going to mill in South 
Africa reminds one somewhat of the 
same process as it used to be followed 
in New England. Time is not of much 
importance in the Transvaal, and the 
Boer who wishes to have a load of 
mealies ground takes them to the mill, 
outspans, and then calmly waits until 
all is ready for his return homeward. 

It is baking day once a week in the 
South African household, and the bread 
is generally baked in a large outside 
oven, made of clay taken from ant- 
hills. These ovens are a feature of 
every homestead. A fire is made in 
the oven, and the opening in the front 
is closed with a stone wrapped in sack- 
ing. When the oven is sufficiently hot, 
the fire is raked out, the bread put in- 
side, and the door once more blocked. 
Again comes a reminder of New Eng- 
land and the old brick ovens from which 
came baked beans and bread of rye and 
Indian meal. 

In Africa the bread is left to bake 
until the oven is cold : it is then drawn 
forth ready for use. The big loaves 
are made of mealie meal, Kaffir beer 
having been employed instead of yeast. 
While fresh, the bread is extremely ap- 
petizing, but a peculiar feature is the 
rapidity with which it hardens. Before 
a week has passed, it is of the consistency 
of stone. Physicians declare it would 
be better for the teeth of ^Americans 
and Europeans if they ate more hard 
bread, and in South Africa you cer- 
tainly must have strong grinders to 
eat the bread. Whether or not such 
eating produces teeth of the required 
strength is a question each must decide 
for himself. — Home and Abroad. 

All the fine hats in the world will not 
look so nearly like a halo around a 
wife's head as will the steam from a 
good dinner which she has cooked. —

Pepper and Salt 

Pepper and Salt fell out one day, — the quarrel 

was exciting. 
Salt was very calm and cool, but Pepper just 

was biting. 

Tbey got into a perfect stew, the cook said it 

was Irish, 
(Sometimes she called it a ragout, it sounded 

much more stylish). 

I heard the Salt moan out this plaint, " No 

matter what the weather. 
On salad days and roasting days, we're always 

thrown together. 



And Pepper answered back in heat, with some- 
thing just as horrid. 

Just then the Stew got laughing so it fairly 

bubbled over, 
And Salt dissolved in briny tears as cook 

whipped off the cover. 

"Oh, dearl" said she, "the stew is spoiled, 

there's too much pepper in it. 
I'll have to throw it all away, and make some 

more this minute." 

And so she did, so I've been told, this very 

wasteful gir-rul: 
She never knew, like you and me, about this 

frightful quarrel.

Trie new edition of Webster's Inter- 
national Dictionary, recently issued, 
brings Webster again abreast of tbe 
growth of the language, and again con- 
firms it in its position as the one great 
standard authority. A decade has 
passed since the International was first 
published, and the years have been full 
of changes and growth in life and knowl- 
edge and achievement, — changes that 
have been reflected in the language and 
that must now be registered in the 
dictionary. 

A supplement of additional words has 
therefore been added to the Inter- 
national to include the thousands of 
new words that have come into liter- 
ary use, the old words that have changed 
their meanings, the obsolete words that 
have been revived.

That is what it means to have Welch's Grape 
Juice, a grape juice which contains nothing but 
what is in the grape itself. 

Housewives will find it invaluable to have it 
always in the house, not merely as a tonic for 
the sick (although it is excellent for that), but 
as a constant, every-day, social beverage. It 
takes the place of wine and all other drinks. 
It can be served as it- comes or diluted, accord- 
ing to taste, and can be made up into a number 
of attractive forms. Wherever there are children, 

Welch's 



will be found invaluable.

Health and Cleanliness 

The modern housekeeper recognizes 
the fact that absolute cleanliness in 
the home is the first essential to health, 
and her attention is ever directed 
toward finding an article which will 
without question give her this important 
requisite and at the same time do the 
work economically and with as little 
. labor as possible. 

As an illustration, I might mention 
sulpho-napthol, which combines all the 
desirable properties, in that it is a 
positive germicide and perfect cleaner. 
A very small quantity of such an article 
is used in a pail of water, the resulting 
solution, or, more properly, emulsion, 
cleansing, purifying, and preserving the 
wood. There is a distinctive air of 
healthfulness in such cleanliness, and 
much satisfaction to the housekeeper 
in the knowledge that any and all dis- 
ease germs that may have found their 
way into her home have been destroyed. 
The solution, penetrating all cracks and 
crevices, carries to the most obscure 
places a powerful germ-destroying liquid. 

A HAIR SIEVE set in the flour 
barrel saves time and labor. Slight 
pressure combined with a rotary motion 
fills it with once-sifted flour, into which 
the bandied sifter may be pressed and 
filled with that which is twice sifted.

The New Hygiene 

There's a new-fangled science that sets at de- 
All efforts to have any good of our wealth 

In eating or drinking, in working or thinking. 
Whatever we do, it is bad for our health. 

We must not eat toffee, we must not drink 
coffee; 
In cocoa's there's paresis, poison in tea. 

Disease germs just swarm in the room that 



And drafts of cold a 



n a grave- digger's 



There's nothing that's healthful, there's noth- 
ing that's dean, 
If we heed all the rules of the new hygiene! 

Ran food is pernicious; if cooked, not ntjtri- 

Fruit makes us too bilious, and sugar too fat ; 
Vegetarian diet runs down those who try it. 

And meat's only tit to be thrown to the cat. 
If we fry it, we spoil it; 'tis deadly to boil it, 

And nothing should ever be roasted or 

All canned stuff's infected; fish must be re- 
jected, 
And all breakfast foods with suspicion be 

It's a safe proposition that man will grow lean 
If he eats by the rules of the new hygiene! 

One tells us 'tis risky to drink any whiskey ; 

Another teetotal regime will deride; 
Wine causes hysteria; milk's full of bacteria; 

Of lager beer many a victim has died. 
The typhoid bacillus that's likely to kill us 

Is found in the water we draw from the well, 
While that from the river is bad for the liver, 

And fouled are the springs that they bottle 
and sell. 
If all this is true, it is plain to be seen 
There is naught fit to drink in the new hygiene. 

In sports we grow colder, for golf has its 
shoulder, 
lawn tennis its elbow, and football its knee; 
While auto urobilin g and all kinds of wheeling 
Will give us the face that is frightful to see. 
We must not dress thickly, — that makes a man 
sickly; 
We must not dress thinly,— we may catch 
the grip. 
And — here's the most awful — a lriss is unlaw- 
ful, 
Especially when it is pressed on the Up. 
Oh, few will our joys be in life, if we mean 
To abide by the rules of the new hygiene!

The Food of the Plucky Jap 

The recent announcement from Lon- 
don that the largest contractor for the 
Russian army had asked for quotations 
on Triscuit delivered at Vladivostock 
has revived discussion of the dietetic 
habits of the Japs. 

Triscuit is the shredded whole-wheat 
cracker, made by the same concern at 
Niagara Falls that makes shredded 
whole-wheat biscuit. Being compressed 
into a wafer, it contains all the nu- 
triment in the whole-wheat berry in 
small bulk and is ready cooked. That 
it should be regarded as a good ration 
for an army is significant of the growing 
belief in whole-wheat food as having 
the most strength-giving properties in 
proportion to bulk. 

The popular notion is that the Jap 
subsists largely upon rice and dried 
fish. We know that he gets little beef 
or pork. We are rather surprised, 
therefore, to leam from Dr. Eastlake 
of Japan, head of the School of Foreign 
Languages in Tokio, that cooked whole 
wheat forms such an important part of 
his daily dietary. In an interview in 
Philadelphia the other day Dr. East- 
lake said: — 

"The army biscuit consists of a cake 
one-fourth rice and three-fourths wheat, 
flavored with both sugar and salt. It 
is placed in water, and allowed to swell 
up before eating. I have seen Japan- 
ese eat four of these cakes, but two 
were all I could manage."

Nicelle Olive Oil as a therapeutic 
agent may be used in numerous ways. 
It acts as a protective to the skin, and 
renders the skin soft and pliable. If 
rubbed into the skin, it is absorbed, and 
is, therefore, nutritive. This faculty 
makes it valuable in malnutrition, es- 
pecially in infants, and its use is very 
beneficial in such cases. 

Food Value. — Nicelle Olive Oil has 
all the elements of a perfect food, and 
for purposes of nutrition it cannot be 
surpassed. As a laxative, it acts with 
good results. 

A ppendiciiis. — The use of Nicelle 
Olive Oil is general in the treatment of 
appendicitis. It will shorten the period 
of inflammation, and, after the acute 
symptoms have passed, will restore the 
appendix to its normal condition. 

Local Applications. — The use of Ni- 
celle Olive Oil as a local treatment 
is strongly recommended. Applied to 
burns or any skin inflammation, it pro- 
tects the surface, soothes the parts, 
and promotes healing. It can also be 
used as an ingredient for liniments, 
for use in reducing swollen or inflamed 
joints.

vessel, that she might have a corner 
in the article ; but, whether this be so 
or not, her friends all enjoy her china, 
and listen interestedly to her teapot 
talks. 

To-day we were not disappointed. 
Clad in her (esthetic gown of light green, 
her bronze hair piled on top of her 



head, and dainty laces at her open 
throat and wrists accentuating a del- 
icate velvety skin, Eleanor began her 
talk as she made preparations to brew 
her beverage. "You all know my re- 
searches are not profound," she began, 
"but there is tea and tea; and, since 
my friends have complimented me by 
calling me 'Brewer in Ordinary to the 
Teapot,' I have been so interested in 
the 'cup that cheers' that I want to 
impart my knowledge. You may not 
guess why I called this a Cha-na-yu, 
but this is what they call a company 
of this nature in Japan, where tea is 
sipped and a talk on tea is given ; and 
I am trying to do exactly as they do. 
Those little cups from which you will 
drink are raku ware, a kind of pot- 
tery which has been used in Japan for 
tea-drinking for centuries; and I warn 
you I expect each to take her cup home 
as a souvenir. I will not insist that 
you take home all the food you cannot 
eat, which is also a custom in Japan. 
I once spoiled my dress in endeavoring 
to carry out this extraordinary po- 
liteness; and I resolved never to ask 
it of others, even if my Japanese party 
was lacking in this particular. 



"In the first place, you admire my 
teapots; but I could not live in Japan, 
where teapots may be said to be an 
inherited craze, so many are possessed 
by each family, without catching a 
little of the craze. Those of my pots 
that I prize most highly were picked 
up by myself in Kioto, where I walked 
one hot day up the steep incline known 
as Teapot Hill. I really think it was 
here that my craze for teapots origi- 
nated, for I never saw such a variety. 
In the shops that line the streets are 
hundreds, thousands of teapots, — 
square, triangular, hexagonal, round, 
oval,— I cannot find words to describe 
them. And the shapes! There are 
baskets, bags, temples, tubs, apples, 
cats, frogs, men, and women. Noth- 
ing seems to appall the maker as re- 
gards intricacy of design. It was here 
I procured this queer puzzle teapot, 
which I selected in Satsuma ware, 
though they came in Owari and Kaga; 
for no material seems to escape the 
Japanese workman. I wanted a gold 
one, but contented myself with look- 
ing at those made from the roots of 
trees, bamboo, shells, and even orange 
rind. You see the one I bought has 
a separate cup and chamber for tea- 
leaves; and I even learned to get 
accustomed to the queer baskets which 
Japanese women use to retain the heat, 
much as we do tea-cozies. 

"As I said, Teapot Hill inspired me 
to start my collection; and, from then 
on, I not only obtained quaint teapots 
that were within the reach of my purse, 
but visited every famous collection 
I heard of. I spent a day viewing 
the collection of the wife of the Rus- 
sian minister to Tokio, who had one 
thousand teapots, which she after- 
ward gave to the Museum at St. Pe- 
tersburg. 

"You know we went to England be- 
fore our return; and, like every other 
subject in which one becomes inter- 
ested, I soon found that in this coun- 



Tea Table 

try I could obtain not only wonderful 
teapots, but any amount of informa- 
tion about tea itself and its recepta- 
cles. It was here I chanced on some 
old books with quaint descriptions 
of how Pope, Dryden, and Mr. Pepys 
had their little 'tay' parties, as they 
called them; and I saw in Pepys's 
diary, under date of Sept. 25, 1660, 
'I did send for a cup of tea, a Chi- 
nese drink, of which I had never 
drunk before.' Then I poked around 
old curiosity shops, hunting for fac- 
similes of Johnson's teapots; for the 
famous doctor had two, one of a rare 
Oriental design, painted and gilded. 

"In the mtdst of this hunt, I one 
day discovered a treasure. It was in 
a dingy street of Solio, and in a junk 
shop whose extreme dust bespoke 
the antiquity it claimed. The dealer 
said it was a genuine Elizabethan pot; 
and, you will notice, it has two divi- 



sions and two spouts for holding both 
black and green tea. I hesitated be- 
tween this and a singular- looking ves- 
sel that had no opening at the top. 



tea, than I decided the 'Land of Lib- 
erty Tea' was the very place to ob- 
tain new specimens. I haunted the 
Boston Museum of Aft, where they 



Some Rare Old Pieces 



The aperture at the bottom admitted 
the water, and atmospheric pressure 
prevented its running. I wish I had 
one of these to show you, for it was 
quaint and curious. It came from 
Holland, and bespoke the singular 
evolution of the rude water jar of the 
Assyrian, through the water-pot of 
the Persian, to this, which lacked both 
handle and mouth-piece. I afterward 
saw one of these pots in a collection 
of Chinese ceramics; and it was la- 
belled 'After an Aztec model,' which 
I felt was a mistake. Though I failed 
to get this, I bought this Wedgwood 
pot of blue and white jasper, which I 
value highly as a fine example of what 
De Quincey calls 'the eternal teapot'; 
for I find it a stand-by in making the 
social, mirth- provoking beverage which 
we call tea. 

"I was interrupted in my search for 
other pots, which I felt would be val- 
uable in my collection, by that stern 
arbiter of one's fate, a husband, who, 
I think, really brought me home, lest 
the family patrimony should be wasted 
in pottery. He counted without his 
host, though; for I no sooner reached 
these shores and landed in Boston 
Harbor, which was once fairly steeped in 



have a collection gathered for the pur- 
pose of forming a guide to the evolu- 
tion of ceramic productions. I fancied 
the New England dames, following the 
fashion of their sisters in England, 
tripping to the apothecary shop for 
a 'chaw of tay,' and, in Salem, boiling 
it in an iron kettle. Perhaps some of 
you can remember her grandmother 
telling of carrying her own teapot. 
My grandmother even carried her own 
tea to parties, and I believe I must 
inherit her tea -drinking propensities. 

"I can show you two teapots ob- 
tained on this shore that I am particu- 
larly proud of. You see that queer 
brown jug over there, with the inscrip- 
tion, — 



I would not part with that pot for any 
money, nor with the one next to it, 
which is a Cardogan pot, made in the 
time of George IV., and is filled through 
the bottom with a spiral tube running 
to the top." 

Eleanor paused to gain breath, and 
glanced around her visitors. Each 
woman's face was alight with interest 
and each held her raku cup. "I have 



A Cha-na-yu Party

kept you waiting a long time," she 
said with a smile, "but it was because 
you honored me by seeming interested. 
Now I shall make the tea. You will 
notice that I boil my tea eight minutes 
for English breakfast and five minutes 
for Ceylon. It adds greatly to the 
flavor, but even correct brewing needs 
good tea. 

"There is a sacred story told of the 
tea plant, which has always appealed 
to me. You know it; but I will re- 
peat it, that we may enjoy it together. 
It is said that Darumah, a great Buddh- 
ist saint of India in the sixth cen- 
tury, spent nine years in meditation. 
At the end of that time he slept sound 
one night, being wearied with mental 
exhaustion. So great was the saint's 
anger when he awoke that he cut off 
his lazy eyelids, and flung them to the 
ground. Each lid was suddenly trans- 
formed into a plant, which we now 
call the tea plant. Whatever its origin, 
tea has been a favorite beverage with 
the Buddhists of Japan, who have 
be^n drinking it for so many years that 



they have a right to assume a teapot as 
a national crest. 

"The division of tea into black and 
green you are familiar with. Perhaps 
you do not know they are not from 
different parts, but get their color from 
different curing processes. Yester- 
day I used English breakfast tea, which 
is a general name for all Chinese black 
teas, on account of their popularity 
in England. To-day I use three parts 
of Japan and souchong, two parts of 
orange pekoe, and five parts of oolong. 
I think you will like it ; for the formula 
was given me by an old Chinaman 
who brewed tea for the missionaries, 
and whose invariable answer to in- 
quiries was, 'Me boilee tea long nuff 
to makee lobster red.' Another recipe 
of this wonderful man is six ounces 
of Formosa oolong to two of Ning 
Choe and basket-fired Japan, mixed. 
It is the correct blending that gives 
the fragrance and taste to tea. My 
researches have not been profound, 
but I have learned something in regard 
to teapots and tea." 



A Collection of Rare China 



Spring Song 

By Lucia W. Eames 



With laughter on our lips we go 

Into the fields a-Maying, 
In ways of light, through sunshine bright, 

With rhythmic steps advancing. 

Chased by the breeze, the fleecy clouds 

Across the blue are flying, 
While at our feet the meadows sweet 

In gray and green are blending. 



The bobolinks in friendly glee 
Above our heads are circling. 

And all the throng with languid song 
The balmy air are flooding. 

Forget-me-nots close by the stream 
Behind the grass are hiding. 

And everywhere the daisies fair 
For doubting maids are growing. 



Ah, what delight to roam the fields 
When hearts with love are swelling, 

And, soothed by song, to linger long, 
Among the blossoms bending! 



A Chapter in Bluebird History 

By Mrs. Charles Norman 



FROM time to time there has been 
recounted in one periodical or 
another delightful experiences in 
taming wild bluebirds, which have 
given every reader a hope of having a 
like story to relate. It has seemed 
only a question of opportunity. Some 
day the bluebirds would come, and, 
finding a house ready for them, they 
would only need to be fed upon meal- 
worms, and then would follow all those 
happy events of which others had writ- 
ten. Perhaps, too, there would be a 
series of charming photographs, which 
would be a joy forever I 

Alas! the opportunity has come, and 
no sensational story attaches thereto 1 
That which follows is simply "a round, 
unvarnished tale" of disappointing 
facts, a true story of bluebirds that 
could not be "tamed to eat on the 
window-sill in three hours' time," or 
in three months' time. 

We took possession of our country 
home May i, and, in spite of a topsy- 
turvyness in domestic affairs, at once 
constructed a bird-house, facetiously la- 
belled "For Bluebirds," and placed it in 
a walnut-tree, about eighteen feet above 
ground. It was not built with a re- 
movable front, as it should have been, 
but it was a charming bark-covered 
habitation. It was made without a 
veranda or door-step, in the hope of 
keeping out English sparrows, and 
we doubted if any bird could get into 
it. 

We did not know there was a blue- 
bird in the vicinity, and when, a few 
days later, one honored us with a call, 
we were greatly shocked to see him 
rudely driven away by a pair of robins 
that were nesting in the walnut-tree. 
Indeed, for four weeks the robins were 
so aggressive that a young observer was 
led to inquire, very seriously, if we sup- 



posed the robins would allow any nuts 
to grow on that tree. 

By June i, however, robin rule ended. 
Father and mother robin and four baby 
robins had gone noisily away, and blue- 
birds began to pipe their mellow notes 
from our fences and trees. On June 6 
we had the joy of seeing a bluebird 
enter the bird-house. It was almost 
dusk. Two birds sat side by side on a 
branch, when, with a low murmur, the 
male darted into the tiny door. Three 
times he repeated the performance, 
while his mate sat by, apparently un- 
interested. Then they departed, per- 
haps for the night. 

At six o'clock the next morning we 
were stationed at the observation win- 
dow to watch proceedings. The male 
bluebird was present, and was enter- 
taining himself by flying in and out of 
the box-house, as if to show how very 
easy it was and how superfluous a door- 
step would have been. His mate was 
not visible, but we had a feeling that 
she was somewhere about. Almost con- 
stantly for an hour and a half the male 
continued his inspection of the quar- 
ters, when suddenly his mate darted 
into sight, and flew determinedly at a 
tin can which was mounted on the 
clothes-line post for the use of wrens. 
The opening in the can was scarcely an 
inch in diameter, and it is useless to 
say that Madame Bluebird found it 
impossible to enter. However, she 
perched upon the top of the can for 
some time, and viewed it thoroughly. 
Meantime her lord sat in front of the 
bird-house, talking quite gently. Mad- 
ame made a few more reckless dashes at 
the can! Her companion even came 
down, and tried the door. One effort 
was enough for him. He returned to 
the little house, and flew in and out, 
over and over, as if to show her how

nice it was in comparison. This be- 
havior must have irritated the lady, 
for off she went, without so much as a 
glance at his chosen abode. 

In her absence we enlarged the en- 
trance to the tin can, and tied thereon 
a green branch, to attract attention to 
it. We were anxious to see whose will 
would prevail, when the two situa- 
tions became possibilities. For the re- 
mainder of the day, and during the 
succeeding days, the male bird did not 
long desert the rustic home. He 
seemed to have his heart set upon it. 
His mate, whom we christened "Mis- 
tress Mary, quite contrary," never went 
near the can, so far as we knew. She 
wanted it only on condition she couldn't 
get it. She was not even seen for three 
whole days. We wondered if she were 
not off in the woods, pouting. 

On June 10 she reappeared, and 
carried one piece of grass into the box. 
Then she was off again for twenty-four 
hours, keeping her handsome lord in 
suspense, as she did us. The next 
morning she returned, and worked in- 
dustriously for some time. The male 
bird must have breathed a sigh of relief, 
or perhaps he knew her well enough to 
suspect that the matter was not settled 
yet. He politely accompanied her on 
every trip to the tree, admired her. work 
immensely, but did not venture any as- 
sistance. He often came alone to the 
tree, but it was a risk much too great 
for his lady to incur. 

By afternoon Mistress Mary had re- 
pented her haste in accepting the bird- 
box. Her heart began to yearn for the 
privacy of the woods and the comforts 
of a hollow tree. So she carried away 
her building material as fast as she had 
taken it in. Her observers almost de- 
spaired, and the small child expressed 
a hope that the "papa bluebird would 
take the house, whether the mamma did 
or not." Imagine his establishing there 
a club-house or bachelor apartments ! 

Matters continued in the same way 



for several days, and, when, at last, it 
was determined that the bluebirds were 
actually nesting in the house, it was 
still doubtful if they would raise a brood, 
as they seemed to spend all their time 
giddy-gaddying. We thought they 
themselves had certainly been reared 
in the deep forest, for they were so ex- 
tremely timid, and took alarm at every 
sound; and, although we were feeding 
chipping-sparrows and song-sparrows 
at the door, we could never succeed in 
getting a bluebird to take a morsel of 
our food. We thought it would be 
different when the young were hatched, 
if that climax were ever reached; but 
the situation was even worse than be- 
fore. Bluebirds never perched on our 
trees in the three months that followed, 
and all manner of sacrifices to their 
comfort did not decrease their reticence 
toward us. We tried to treat them 
fairly, and we never once laid our eager 
hands upon the three little ones, — the 
much heard but unseen fledglings. 

Both parent birds worked earnestly 
in carrying food, always going to a dis- 
tance to obtain it. They went and 
came in silence, and would even refrain 
from going in at all if any one was in 
sight. Trips to the nest were made 
every three minutes during the entire 
time the young were there. Work 
began at 5 a.m., and continued until 
about 8 p.m.; that is, fifteen hours, 
which means three hundred trips daily. 
We noticed no variation in the feeding 
of one-day-old infants and fifteen-day- 
old, except that the morsels became 
distinctly visible as the age of the nest- 
lings advanced. 

On the afternoon that they were six- 
teen days old we were absent from 
home for two hours. We returned, 
half expecting to see the bluebird family 
perching upon the nearest branch, for 
we had heard that day a somewhat new 
tone from the parent birds, and we 
thought they were urging their brood 
to come out. We had already arranged 



Aunt Patty and the Spencerian Philosophy

our photographing outfit, and we were 
determined to get one picture, no matter 
how resentful an expression they had. 
Hence it was that we almost ran home 
to discover if the little ones were yet 
out of their dark little house. 

They were out, alas ! and gone, as we 
soon found to our chagrin. It seemed 
hard to believe that those young birds 
were not somewhere in the walnut-tree, 
but the closest scrutiny and the most 
diligent listening failed to reveal them. 
We waited till dark for the familiar 
clamoring calls. We were outwitted! 
They had repudiated our courtesies, 
refused our offered food. We felt 
sick. "Ingratitude more strong than 
traitors' arms quite vanquished us." 

The next day we pursued the fugi- 
tives. The "many- voiced clamor" of 
the infants was audible from an impene- 



trable swamp, but we did not get one 
glimpse of them. Later on the trail 
led us to a near-by woods, where we 
found a family of five bluebirds; but, 
whenever we appeared, the young were 
at once beguiled to distant treetops 
with the same persuasive tones which 
had induced them from the box- 
house. 

So ended the study of our bluebirds. 
They never returned to sing their thanks 
for our hospitality, and a bluebird 
was never again seen upon our walnut 
until October 1 1 , when one came with 
a wisp of hay, and darted into an up- 
turned basket that hung in the tree. 
What could it mean? The basket was 
no fit place for spending winter nights. 
Surely, the ways of birds are past find- 
ing out, or, perhaps, this was only 
Mistress Mary, still quite contrary. 



Aunt Patty and the Spencerian Philosophy 

By Helen Campbell 



l€ 




AIN'T much on books. I might 
say I ain't certain but what I 
could do without them an' never 
know, what with folks, an' animals, 
an' my flower garden, an' just bein' 
alive an' kind of wonderin' at it all 
round. There ain't nothing stranger, if 
you come to think of it." 

The young schoolmaster smiled, but 
was silent. He had lived with Aunt 
Patty long enough to know that it 
was often quite worth while to be silent, 
since there came as his reward curious 
bits of wisdom, born first of keen 
powers of observation, and, added to 
it, as keen a sense of humor. 

"You get more out of being laughed 
at by Aunt Patty than by a whole 
township crying over you," a neigh- 
bor had said to him, and added: "We'd 



all feel as if the bottom had dropped 
out of things, if anything happened 
to her. She kind of keeps us all to- 
gether." 

She stood now before the school- 
master, holding the package he had 
just put into her hands, and begin- 
ning to untie the knots. 

"String is a good deal cheaper than 
time," he said, his sharp knife as he 
spoke ending any future usefulness 
for that one; and now, as Aunt Patty 
shook her head, a box disclosed itself. 

"Oh! Then 'tain't a book. I did 
think it was a queer kind of shaped 
one, but there ! Books an' 'most every- 
thing else ain't always the shape you'd 
expect, an' I don' know as they're 
obleeged to be. Lawful heart! You 
hain't gone an' bought a pitcher, when

I told you the little one you broke 
was good for nothing, anyhow.' ' 

It was a three-sided, highly deco- 
rated little pitcher, with the barest 
suggestion of spout; and the little old 
lady, whose lips had shut close as she 
looked at it, now raised her still youth- 
ful blue eyes. 

"To think of you remembering it! 
I'm sure I'm obleeged to you over an' 
over." 

"You couldn't be more welcome," 
the schoolmaster said, but his hand 
had already moved toward the book- 
rack at the end of the long table; and 
Aunt Patty, whose dusting, thorough 
as it was, never altered the place of 
even the smallest trifle, tinned to go, 
then faced him again. 

"It's an awful thick book. Both of 
them are. But you've always told 
me to look at 'em, if I wanted to; an' 
I opened right to him that wrote it, 
an' Herbert Spencer underneath, an' 
him humbly enough to split the cover. 
But my ! what sense for a man ! " 

' ' Which volume, Aunt Patty ? " But 
her hand was already on it. 

"You won't mind. I slipped in a 
bit of paper just because I was so took 
aback at his knowing, that I wanted 
to read it again. I seemed kind of 
directed to jest that page. You have 
to study it out, — or I did, — for his words 
are the longest he could pick; an', if 
I hadn't known an Englishwoman 
once that always said jug for pitcher, — 
so much so that it sort of got into 
folks' minds that she was anti-pro- 
hibition, — I couldn't a-told what he 
meant. Who is he, anyhow?" 

"A famous philosopher," the young 
schoolmaster said as she pointed again 
to the second volume of Herbert Spen- 
cer's Autobiography. 

"That, too? I am only just be- 
ginning the first one. What is it?" 

"Words I couldn't pronounce, not 
to save me, letting alone knowing what 
they meant. But I kind of took it 



in somehow; an* then I jest sat down 
with your big dictionary an' worried 
it all out best I could, so pleased to 
think he'd said jest what I've thought 
a long spell, that I wouldn't a-minded 
twice the trouble. Read it out, do. 
You always make things so plain, an' 
I'll see if I can remember them mean- 
ings. You see he starts out with 
something I made up my mind to long 
ago, — that folks try all ways of doing 
a thing wrong before they worry out 
the right one. It's page 238. I'm 
real pleased to think you're going to 
read it to me." And now she faced 
him with intent eyes, as he read: — 

"'I have often startled people by 
the paradox that mankind go right 
only when they have tried all possi- 
ble ways of going wrong, intending 
it, of course, not to be taken quite 
literally. Of late, however, I have 
observed sundry cases in which, in- 
stead of going beyond the fact, it falls 
short of it, — cases in which, having 
found the right, people deliberately de- 
sert it for the wrong. They do this even 
in simple household usages, where a 
small modicum of sense might have 
been expected to prevent them. . . . 
In my boyhood a jug was made of 
a form at once convenient and grace- 
ful. The body of the jug had a shape 
deviating but little from a sphere, 
and therefore had the advantage that, 
however the jug was inclined, the sur- 
face of the contained liqiiid had, for 
a considerable time, nearly the same 
area, so that, with increasing inclina- 
tion, pouring out went on at a toler- 
ably uniform rate. The spout, too, 
was sufficiently large, and of such shape 
that it would deliver either a small or 
a large quantity without waste. And 
then, within the limits of convenience, 
the outline of jug and handle admitted 
of numerous elegant combinations of 
curves. Now, however, the prevailing 
— indeed almost universal — form of jug 
in use is a frustum of a cone, with a 



miniature spout. It combines all pos- 
sible defects. When anything like full, 
it is impossible to pour out a small 
quantity without part of the liquid 
trickling down beneath the spout; and 
a larger quantity cannot be poured out 
without exceeding the limits of the 
spout, and running over on each side of 
it. If the jug is half empty, the tilting 
must be continued for a long time be- 
fore any liquid comes, and then, when 
it does come, it comes with a gush, 
because its surface has now become so 
large that a small inclination delivers 
a great deal. To all which add that 
the shape is as ugly a one as can well 
be hit upon.'" 

"To think of him watching till he 
got it all straight as a string," Aunt 
Patty said admiringly, as the school- 
master laid down the book and gazed 
on his purchase with an entirely re- 
constructed idea of what a pitcher 
should be. "An' he's a philosopher! 
I didn't know any of 'em had that 
much sense," she went on thoughtfully. 
"There was one here last summer at 
the summer school, you know, or they 
said he was one, but he never seemed to 
see anything before him, an' his wife 
running after him constant, like a hen 
with one chicken, for he didn't know 
enough to go in when it rained. The 
new minister said he was a Hegaleian, 
an' that they was mostly so, but who 
Hegaleian was I don't know. Laugh 
away. It'll do you good." For from 
the schoolmaster came suddenly a roar 
of laughter. 



'"Twas funny," Aunt Patty went on, 
"but they ain't all that way. This 
man isn't, an' I'm going to stick to 
him an' read as much as I can under- 
stand, but why a man should say 
'frustum' when he means just a piece 
beats me. Otherwise, so far an' so 
forth, I'm a believer, far as I've got. 
For the land's sake!" For now the 
schoolmaster, rising, laid the pitcher on 
the coal-scuttle, and with a blow of the 
poker ended its mission of inadequacy. 

"I'm glad I've got something to go 
by now," he said, "and I'll hunt up 
one according to his prescription. He 
has certainly given me a new notion of 
how to judge." 

"Have to have your eyes open be- 
fore you can see," Aunt Patty replied 
as she put the volume carefully in its 
place. "I guess I've been a Spencer- 
ian without knowing it some consider- 
able time, but I'll look into him some 
more, for there's more right along there 
about inkstands and snuffers that ain't 
all they should be." 

"Yes, you are a Spencerian," the 
schoolmaster said seriously; "and you 
hit upon one of the most practical pages 
he ever wrote, though he is certainly 
a practical philosopher. You are a 
Spencerian through and through, Aunt 
Patty. Shake hands. He's a oner, 
and so are you." 

"I couldn't say just what that means, 
but you can call me the other whenever 
you're a mind to." And Aunt Patty, 
gathering up the remnants of the pitcher, 
descended to her own place. 



The Awakening

The sunshine kissed the sodden earth. 
And, lot bright flowers bloomed above: 

Kindness touched a heart that was cold, 
It woke; and blossomed in deeds of love. 



A Lesson in Simplicity 

By Kate Gannett Wells 



IF ever there was a man who, un- 
awares to himself, yet through his 
personality, set forth the beauty of 
the simple life, it was John G. Whit- 
tier, the New England poet, for he dis- 
liked the conventions of society and 
expensive menus as much as he relished 
New England pumpkin pie, — 

"none sweeter or better 
E'er smoked from an oven or circled a platter!" 

And he gleefully recalled the boyhood 
days, — 

"When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin 
. . . with a candle within." 

It was his unaffected greeting, his 
kindly manners at table, and his simple 
tastes in food and pleasures that made 
him one summer the unconscious moni- 
tor of a little country hotel, where some 
of us were puzzled how to look pleasant 
or to be sociable, when we did not like 
the menus, if any genuine New England 
fare can, be called such. Then was it 
that we gained our lessons in the polite- 
ness of the heart, for Mr. Whittier al- 
ways seemed to like everything. Or, if 
we fancied he could not, he so bright- 
ened us with some quaint bit of cor- 
diality that our own appetites revived. 

There we were, just an average lot 
of people, and with children who cried, 
and who spilt their milk on the clean 
table-cloth next to Mr. Whittier's plate. 
Yet he never was fretted. Thus we 
learned from him what democracy 
meant, and how cordiality is duty, and 
sympathy is good manners, and how 
exclusiveness is particularly out of 
place at a long, country dinner table 
or on a sunny piazza. 

He had gone there for rest — but that 
he could not have, if any one were 
lonely — and to have a quiet, sociable 
time, and that he gave us by never 
ignoring us. His simple breakfast 



greeting was a benediction to friend or 
stranger. If all boarding-houses could 
be what his simplicity made that one, 
there would not be so many lonely 
lives in them. Withal he was most 
courteous, never obtruding or aggres- 
sive, but mindful alike of the etiquette 
of reserve, and of table manners. The 
very children learned to imitate his 
quiet mode of eating, of handling his 
knife and fork, and of never leaving 
crumbs on the table around his plate. 

Better than his kindliness at meal 
times or in piazza chats was his en- 
joyment of the ample spaces of the 
barn for our talking place. We soon 
cared more for those hours with him 
than for any other delight of the days, 
the conversation usually turning on 
poetry, anti-slavery, and religion. At 
first he was amused at the business 
way in which we had planned to take 
our vacation, — just so many pages to 
read, so many miles to walk, and so 
many stitches to embroider for the 
Christmas ahead of us. And, at first, 
we rather rebelled against his kindly 
humor, and tried to justify our efforts 
at self-improvement, but, as no one 
could long resist his appeal for a good, 
lazy talk in the hay mound, we quickly 
gathered from him the secret of growth 
through rest and letting ourselves 
alone. 

Sometimes he tested our love of 
poetry by asking us to read aloud. 
"Oh," he once exclaimed, after a lady 
had read to him her favorite poem, 
"you brought out the meaning and left 
out the rhythm. Where is the sing- 
song?" Then she recited some dog- 
gerel, and also some directions for 
knitting. "That's better," he an- 
swered. "I like them just because of 
their sing-song measure." 

He was very fond of story-telling; 



and, laughing at me for my way of 
being sleepy at breakfast, because I 
still persisted in rising early to accom- 
plish my self-prescribed quota of pages 
from Herbert Spencer, would beg: 
* ' Now we have had enough of the eter- 
nal and everlasting. Tell a story." 

Those were stirring hours when we 
had persuaded him to talk of by-gone 
days, — how, as a boy of seventeen, he 
had caught the newspaper thrown to 
him over a stone wall, in which was 
published his first poem, and, holding 
it in his hands, burst out with the 
words, "That's me!" Another time he 
told us of the German who, at the first 
slave trial in Philadelphia, "drove a 
thunderbolt of oaths through seven 
languages" at the criminal. Such a 
phrase was almost as exciting as if 
Mr. Whittier himself had sworn. And, 
again, he spoke of his lack of physical 
bravery (as he alone fancied), adding, 
"What I did, I did as duty." 

Occasionally he spoke with a quiet 
earnestness that seemed to throw an 
atmosphere of holiness across the rafters 
of that barn, saying: "My belief in 
God and immortality is so strong that 
no argument could convince me of the 
contrary. What can we know if not 
ourselves?" "But," inquired someone, 
"is it intuition?" "It is God," he re- 
plied. ' ' Is our bother and wonder over 
immortality to go for nothing? No. 
We all for nothing? No." 

Perhaps no single act of his made a 
deeper impression upon our often care- 
less mirth than his courtesy to one of 
the household guests, whose shyness 
had kept her from having good times 
with the rest of us. We were still at 
the dining-table one day, when the 
noon coach drove up to cany passen- 
gers to the depot. "Who is leaving?" 
he asked, and, when he saw that none 
of us rose to go and wish the custom- 
ary good-bye of the house, he pushed 



away his plate and chair, and with a 
pained look left the room. Long after 
I learned that the young girl to whom 
he went to say good-bye had greeted 
him with a choking sob. "Oh, Mr. 
Whittier, you are so good, just for me;" 
and from that time had begun her 
trust in human goodness, because of 
his hand-shake through the coach win- 
dow and his pleasant words of fare- 
well. 

It was just that trust which Mr. 
Whittier gave to many of us that sum- 
mer. We were more or less discordant 
with ourselves and others, we had 
little money, we did much of our own 
work, and yet tried to seem at leisure 
and young. We were not social suc- 
cesses. Disappointments with our- 
selves, our futile ambitions, our house- 
keeping failures, our daily drudgery, 
which we had not had the common 
sense to turn into a blessing, had led 
to our going off to recover prestige 
and health. And we stumbled, or a 
benignant fate led us into the presence 
of a perfectly simple man, who had 
faith in human goodness. 

He was so much of a gentleman we 
could not ignore his high-bred ease. He 
was so little of an aristocrat we did not 
much mind being just our tired selves. 
His truthfulness was so exact that we 
told our stories, when we had any, 
without exaggeration. His simplicity 
was so beautiful that we laid aside our 
social hankerings. Our regeneration 
began with his quiet demeanor at table, 
his freedom from fault-finding, and his 
acceptance of whatever was set before 
him, and our salvation was attained 
by those talks in the barn. 

Others remember him as poet and 
reformer. We recall him as the serene 
man, who made us contented with our 
daily duties and with being just our 
average selves, with our purposes truer 
than their often awkward results. 



How Betty Learned to Cook 

By Bertha C. Ely 



i€ 




HERB can my Caesar be! 
I know I left it with my 
other books I " And Betty 
tossed things about in the library, 
and then ran to her own room in a 
fruitless search. The missing book 
was finally discovered in a corner of 
the divan, where Betty had, the even- 
ing before, curled up to learn a few 
last things. 

With a hurried good-bye, she was 
off to school. Then her mother quietly 
went upstairs. As she passed her 
daughter's room, she paused and looked 
in, and saw confusion, indeed, — the bed 
not even opened, and the bureau in 
great disorder. As she closed drawers, 
picked up the scattered clothes, and 
smoothed out tumbled hair ribbons, 
she thought: "I wonder how my little 
girl is ever to learn the many things 
she should know when she has such 
taxing school and outside duties to 
attend to first. The years are slip- 
ping away, and there seems to be no 
time for household tasks." Then she 
remembered the long vacation that 
was now not far off, and determined 
that a part of it, at least, should be 
spent in learning homely as well as 
homey duties. 

So it happened that, when the long 
rest from school came, Betty was given 
regular home duties, and among them 
was responsibility in the kitchen. 

The plan had been talked over with 
the cook, who was willing to assist; 
for she had always been fond of Betty 
and her sunny ways, and never felt 
her presence in the kitchen an intru- 
sion. 

The bread of all kinds was to be 
Betty's care, and to be made by her. 
She could have all the help and ask 
for all the instruction or information 
she wished; but the care was to be 



hers, as well as the opportunity to 
branch out and use original ideas. 

She began by making yeast, then 
plain white bread. She was closely 
watched by the cook, who felt that 
her reputation was at stake. 

Then came rolls of different kinds; 
and Betty's enthusiasm grew, espe- 
cially as all possible encouragement 
was given her. In order that all re- 
sponsibility might be hers, she never 
was to be reminded of her charge or 
given unsought advice. 

All went well at first, while the new- 
ness lasted. Then came an evening 
when "not a bite was there fit to eat 
in the house," as Bridget said. At 
another time a suddenly planned pic- 
nic called for sandwiches, and, behold! 
an empty bread jar. 

Of course there was the baker to 
call on, but that was somewhat of 
a reflection upon Betty. A few such 
reminders kept her more on her guard. 

Then her interest seemed to take 
on new life, and she began to ask about 
French rolls and German bread. 

Her pretty curls were often bent 
over a cook-book, while her brow was 
wrinkled in her efforts to fathom some 
new mystery. 

The experiment was really working. 
As Betty's confidence grew, she be- 
came delighted with her success, and 
divulged to her friends her new study. 

Of course, they did not wish to be 
left behind; and so each, in her own 
home, assumed a responsibility, — one 
of cake, another of soup, and a third 
of pastry. They ransacked cook- 
books, begged and borrowed recipes 
from their friends and relatives; and 
then they began to invent little new 
combinations of their own. 

One afternoon the girls were to- 
gether on Betty's piazza, — two in the 



How Betty Learned to Cook

hammock, one propped up against the 
post doing fancy work, while Betty 
was tilted back in a rocking-chair, 
clasping her knee, her brow all crum- 
pled in thought. Suddenly she burst 
out: "If only we had girls to prepare 
meat, vegetables, and salads also, we 
could give little luncheons. Wouldn't 
it be fun!" 

"Yesterday Fanny Brown asked me 
if she could join us, provided she 
cooked something," said the soup girl, 
and added: "If we can't find enough 
girls to care for the courses, why not 
do a little more ourselves? I could 
take vegetables, and that would leave 
salads only." 

"Perhaps Gertrude Payne would do 
that. She is always helping her mother 
do something, you know. Let us ask 
her, anyway!" suggested the pastry 
girl. 

"It would be jolly," added Betty. 
"We could do everything ourselves, and 
the girl who entertained at her own 
home could have the care of the table 
and the decorations. We would send 
her word beforehand what each one 
intended to furnish, so she might 
make out the menu." 

"How delightful!" said the cake 
girl. "And, if we only dared, we could 
invite a few of our friends to the 
spreads!" 

"Yes, and have an outdoor affair, 
setting the table on the lawn," some 
one suggested. 

"Why not have one or two luncheons 
first, to see how they succeed? and 
then, if all is satisfactory, each one 
of us would be privileged to invite 
a guest to the last one," added the 
pastry girl. 

."Perhaps we might have a sale for 
the Fresh Air Fund. I shouldn't be 
ashamed of my rolls," said Betty. 

"Oh, it would be fine to have a 
home bakery, and earn some money 
for Christmas! Do you suppose we 
could? " asked the cake girl, eagerly. 



"Of course," cried all at once. And 
the soup girl added: "You could have 
it in our annex. Don't you remember 
that empty building near the ell? it 
is just the place." 

"We have first to secure a few more 
girls, and they must have experience. 
So let us have the luncheons first, and, 
if they are successful, try the bakery," 
said practical Betty, and added: "I 
thought by this time I could always 
make fine rolls, but we have a new 
barrel of flour, and it is such a trial. 
However, I am learning its ways, 
and therefore mix my dough soft, and 
knead little. Bridget says I'm get- 
ting on, and she is as pleased as I am." 

"I used to hate being called on to 
assist any," said the soup girl; "but 
now it does not seem a hardship at 
all, for I am so interested. There is 
Fanny Brown coming down the street 
this minute. I will call her, and maybe 
she will take salads." 

So they all trooped off the piazza. 
The day finally arrived for the first 
luncheon, and Betty was to be chief 
hostess, as she was the promoter of 
the scheme. There were delicious hot 
cross-buns and bread sticks and sweet 
German bread as her share. 

Such happy, girlish faces as gathered 
about the table! Proud girls they 
were, too, as they realized all had been 
accomplished by themselves. They 
told their recipes and experiences, 
and laughed over mishaps. 

"You should have seen my puff 
paste," said the pastry girl. "My 
oven was so hot it was melting all 
to butter, and Maggie saved it just in 
time. She didn't like it one bit at 
first to have me messing about; but 
now she finds I really do help a little, 
and is much nicer to me." 

"This cake just melts in my mouth. 
How did you make it?" said Betty, 
addressing the responsible member. 

"It's the easiest recipe you ever 
saw, one that a friend gave our cook,

Katie. The knack is really in the 
baking. I call it my Foundation 
Sponge; for it can be used in so many 
ways, either split and filled with 
whipped cream, as this is, or frosted, or 
for russe. My family are really delighted 
with it. Shall I give you the recipe?" 

"Yes, do, ' ' they all answered. 

"You take a cup of granulated sugar 
and two eggs, not beaten separately, 
and a pinch of salt. Beat all these 
toegther with an egg-beater until very 
light. Then into one cup of bread flour, 
that has been sifted four times, put 
one heaping teaspoonful of baking- 
powder. Add these to your egg mixt- 
ure, and also one teaspoonful of 
lemon extract. Beat until very light, 
and add one-half cup of boiling milk, 
and continue to beat. It will make 
a thin batter. Bake in a moderate 
oven for about half an hour." 

"I must remember that recipe," 
said Betty, "for cake is to be my 
next charge; and mother thinks I 



might begin at any time. Not that 
I have exhausted the bread subject, 
by any means, but to have a little 
change and widen my experience." 

"Isn't it strange how interested we 
have become, when only a short time 
ago we thought it a perfect bore to 
help, even when the cook had her 
recreation afternoon?" said the vege- 
table girl. 

"I know it," added the salad maker. 
"And I have been thinking a good deal, 
of late, of joining classes, or going to 
a college, where I can study especially 
these things. I do so want to know 
all I can about the right and best way 
to keep house. I want to be really 
of use in the world, but I haven't 
been able to think just how before this." 

So they chattered, planning the next 
luncheon, and hoping that a bakery 
might be possible at Christmas time, 
or a sale later, for the Fresh Air Fund; 
for experience was giving them con- 
fidence and courage. 



A "Kaffeeklatsch" 

By Mary Alden Hopkins 



THE living-room in a German 
household always contains a 
large sofa at one side of the 
room, which is the seat of honor ac- 
corded a guest. At a Kaffeeklatsch 
(literally, coffee-gossip) the guests of 
honor are seated on this sofa, and the 
large round table is wheeled up before 
them. The other guests seat them- 
selves in chairs about the table. If 
there is not room for all, small tables 
are provided, also. Perhaps the young 
girls will sit at these side tables. The 
first course consists of Kaffee, Kaffee- 



kranz (coffee-cake), and Kaffeekuchlein 
(little coffee-cakes). 

Kaffee 

The coffee served is strong, GeseU- 
schaftskaffee (company coffee), not the 
weak, Blumchenkaffee (flower-coffee) 
which is preferred at usual meals. 
Blumchenkaffee got its name from the 
fact that it is light-colored enough for 
the Blumchen, or little flower, painted 
inside the cup at the bottom to show 
through the liquid. The coffee is 
served with hot milk instead of cream; 



for Germans consider the resulting 
flavor finer, and the drink less harm- 
ful. 

Kaffeekranz 
To one quart of light bread dough 
add one-fourth a cup of melted butter, 
six tablespoon fills of sugar, two eggs, 
and two yolks. Beat these together. 
Then add flour to make stiff, and let 
rise until it has doubled in bulk. 
Cut down, knead slightly, divide into 
three portions, and braid in one long 
braid, bringing the ends together to 
form a circle or crown. Let rise. 
Sprinkle generously with sugar and 
cinnamon, and bake. This large loaf 
will be far too large for any ordinary 
pan. It can be baked on two flat 
cooky-sheets, made without sides, or 
on the bottoms of two inverted bak- 
ing-sheets, if the chasm between is 
covered with a strip of tin. The truly 
German Kafleekram has sugar and 
cinnamon on top; but it is delicious 
to substitute icing and chopped nuts, 
put on after the cake is baked. 

Kaffeekiiehlein 

These are small cakes made like 
our cream cakes and eclairs, except 
that the batter is richer. They are 
tender and rich, and are eaten without 
filling. Sometimes the batter is dropped 
into hot -lard and fried, and a skilled 
cook with a paper funnel can fashion 
it into all sorts of figures. 

The coffee and cakes are removed, 
and the second course is brought on, — 
red wine, Sandtorte (pound cake), and 
confections. Sometimes plum or fruit 
cake is substituted for pound cake, 
but only one kind is served. The 
confections are little fancy cakes, which 
a German cook makes so well. Per- 
haps the nicest of all is Malzipan 
(marchpane). 



Malzipan 

Eight ounces of sweet almonds, one- 
half ounce of bitter almonds, eight 
ounces of sugar. 

Chop and pound the almonds to a 
paste. Boil with the sugar and some 
water until it forms a thick paste. 
Press into a flat sheet, and let cool. 
If one has a stamp, a design can be 
stamped upon the top or moulded on 
with a knife. Then icing, flavored 
with rose water, is poured over, filling 
the depressions; and bits of citron are 
added for decoration. Or the flat 
sheet may be simply iced and cut into 
squares. Marchpane will keep for sev- 
eral weeks in a tin box. 

This dainty is a favorite with Rus- 
sians as well as Germans, and is men- 
tioned in a popular anecdote. A Ger- 
man officer visiting Russia laughingly 
referred to the saying that Russians 
ate tallow. "Indeed, we do," re- 
plied a Russian official. ' ' If you'll 
come to my house to-morrow, I'll 
show you how I can eat it." Upon 
his return home he gave the servant 
orders to prepare two candles, one of 
purest tallow and one of marchpane. 
At dinner the servant was to give the 
tallow candle to the guest and the 
marchpane one to the host. When 
the time came to pass the candles, 
the servant, by mistake, handed the 
marchpane to the guest and the tal- 
low to the master. The guest ate the 
marchpane with satisfaction; and the 
host, unwilling to admit a joke on 
himself, ate — the tallow. 

The third course at the Kaffee- 
klatsch is bread and butter and cut 
meats ; and it is put on the table with- 
out the wine and cake being removed, 
so that, during the remainder of the 
meal, those who wish can have bread 
and meat, and those who wish can con- 
tinue to nibble cake. 



Lessons in Cookery and Food Economy for 
High School and College Classes 

By Mary D, Chambers 
Lesson VII. Meats (continued) 



A SMALL standing roast, the first 
two ribs, -weight about four 
pounds, was chosen to illustrate 
this process. 

Method. — Saw off two or three inches 
from the thin ends of the ribs, slanting 
the saw well in under the meat, to 
avoid exposure of the bone from 
shrinkage during cooking. Place meat 
on rack in roasting-pan, and dredge very 
lightly with flour. Set into hot oven 
for ten to fifteen minutes, to sear. 
Then baste well with a cupful or two 
of hot water, reduce temperature until 
joint barely "sizzles," and baste with 
liquid from pan (water and melted 
fat) every ten or fifteen minutes until 
cooked. Cook ten to fifteen minutes to 
every pound. To serve, pull out the 
small pieces of backbone from thick 
end of roast. If cooked, they can be 
removed easily. Place on hot platter, 
garnish with cress, parsley, duchess 
potatoes, rice croquettes, etc., and set 
before carver with thick end to the 
left. 

Notes. — The cut-off ends of the ribs can be 
cooked with the meat, and used with the " left- 
overs" in making croquettes, shepherd's pie, 
or any of the various forms of re-serving: The 
joint looks sightlier, and is easier to carve, 
when the unnecessary length of rib bone is 
removed. 

Time for cooking depends on shape of joint, 
quality of meat, and various other factors, 
so that number of minutes to a pound is barely 
approximate. To test whether meat is done, 
press with the back of a fork close to the bone: 
if the juice flows red, the meat is not suffi- 
ciently done; if pink, the meat is rare; and, if 
only very faintly pink, the meat is medium 
well done, and should not require further 
cooking. If muscle is dry and has lost 
all elasticity, the joint is over-cooked. 



Bratzed Meat 
A piece of the bottom round, weigh- 
ing two pounds, was chosen. 

Method. — If very lean, the meat may 
first be larded (strips of fat pork 
drawn through upper surface with 
larding needle at about an inch apart, 
ends left about an inch long), barded 
(perpendicular incisions made with bon- 
ing-knife in the meat, strips of fat pork 
thrust into these, and ends cut off even 
with surface), or daubed (thin slices of 
fat pork placed on upper surface of 
meat). 

Sear whole surface of meat in very 
hot pan until brown. Place on rack 
in braizing pan, pour in hot water just 
to reach to rack, put on cover, and 
cook in a slow oven about half an hour 
to every pound of meat. When a 
large piece of meat is to be braized, 
the oven should be of such a tempera- 
ture that the water in the pan will not 
boil for one hour. 

Onion, carrot, turnip, cut in dice, 
about a' cupful of each or more, ac- 
cording to size of piece of meat to be 
braized, can be used to fill in the empty 
space in the pan, and afterwards served 
with the meat. The dish is then 
sometimes called "braized meat a la 
jardiniere" or "a la printaniere." 

Not*. — As braized meat is cooked by a 
combination of roasting and steaming, it is 
not necessary to baste it, and the braizing-pan 
should remain covered during the whole time 
of cooking. 

In default of a regular braizing-pan the 
meat, previously seared, can be placed no a 
bed of vegetables in an ordinary kettle, suffi- 
cient water added barely to reach to top of 
vegetables, and cooked on top of the stove. 
It is then sometimes called "pot roast."

Beef a la Mode 
A piece similar to that for braizing, 
to which fat is added usually by means 
of barding, is seared by pouring boiling 
water over surface, then placed in 
kettle, and hot water added to reach to 
half the height of the meat. Kettle 
is closely covered, and water allowed 
to simmer (180 F.) until meat is 
cooked. Vegetables may be added, as 
in braized meat. 

Notts. — When the meats are cooked by fore- 
going processes, the liquid remaining in pan 
or kettle is strained, skimmed free from fat, 
seasoned, thickened (see stew, p. 446), and 
served in a gravy boat as an accompaniment 
to the roast meat, or poured over the braized 
meat or beef a la mode on platter. 

For larding, etc., the fresh pork fat b most 
suitable. It is recommended, however, in this 
lesson that both fresh and salt pork fat be 
used for similar processes, in order to illustrate 
the effect of oxidation on the coloring matter 
of meat. The principle of osmosis is also in- 
volved, and good correlation can be made 
with general chemistry, physics, and physiol- 
ogy, even should the students have had no 
work in physiological chemistry. 

Pieces of meat, similar to above, can easily 
be prepared, cooked, and served by class in 
a two hour period. The meat, in every case, is 
weighed before and after cooking. 

Corned Beef 
Put on in cold water. Let come 
slowly to a boil, and simmer (180 F.) 
for half an hour to every pound. If 
meat is to be used cold, it will be juicier 
if allowed to cool in the water in which 
it was cooked. Home corned beef, or 
meat not quite so salty as that pur- 
chased from the butcher usually is, 
may be put on in boiling water, tem- 
perature reduced, and then "simmered" 
as before. 

Soup Stock 
During the cooking of the meat, 
soup stock is prepared by the class, 
each student weighing and measuring 
ingredients for stock on a basis of one- 
quarter to one pound of meat, accord- 
ing to size of class. The individual 



gether in one or more soup kettles, and 
the process completed by the teacher. 

Ingredients for Soup Stock. — Meat, 
one or more kinds, with bone. Vege- 
tables, onion, carrot, turnip, celery. 
Herbs, marjoram, thyme, savory, etc. 
Seasoning, allspice cloves, whole pep- 
per, bay leaf. A sour apple or one 
ounce of chopped ham to every two 
quarts of stock gives a good flavor. 

Proportions. — For a light stock, one 
quart of water to one pound of meat. 
For a rich stock, one pint of water to 
one pound of meat. About one-fourth 
as much bone, by weight, as meat. 
One-half to one cup of each vegetable, 
cut in cubes, to every two quarts of 
stock. One-half teaspoon of each herb, 
if dried, one-half teaspoon of the spices, 
mixed, and one bay leaf to every two 
quarts of stock. 

Method. — Wipe meat, and cut into 
small pieces. Put on in cold water, 
and let stand thirty minutes. Place 
over gentle heat, and allow to come to 
a boil very slowly. It should take an 
hour, at least, before boiling-point is 
reached. Add vegetables, with herbs 
and seasoning, tied loosely in cheese- 
cloth, and let simmer six hours (180 
to 185 F.). Strain and cool. 

Questions 

Compare the effect of the three 
methods of searing meat. 

What was the percentage of loss in 
weight during cooking in each cut pre- 
pared to-day? Account for the differ- 
ence in the proportionate loss. 

Why was the roast meat dredged 
with flour? 

Which needs the hotter oven and 
the more frequent basting, a small 
joint or a large one ? Why ? 

What do you think would be the 
result of braizing the rib piece and of 
roasting the bottom round ? Formulate 
two rules regarding time and tempera- 
ture applicable to the cooking of meat.

Song of Sowing 



The furrow lies brown in the wake of the 
plough, 
And the overturned sod is sweet; 
And the sower sings as the seed he flings, 
And his strain keeps time, as his right arm 
swings 
To and fro in a rhythmic beat. 

His song is a prayer that the wind and the rain, 

And their kinsman, the kindly sun, 
Keep a balance fine, betwixt shade and shine, 
In the mystic sequence of growth divine, 
With the work of his hands begun ! 

His song is a dream of the season to be, 

From the blade to the waving June, 
Till the fields unfold into autumn gold 
That shall crown his toil with a wealth untold, 
In the height of the harvest moon! 

Edith Hope Kinney. 



VACATION TIME 

PEOPLE are now beginning to 
think about vacation, the summer 
"outing," and life in the open 
air. The wide-spread custom of a reg- 
ular vacation is commendable. Noth- 
ing is more wholesome than a some- 
time change of scene; nothing is more 
conducive to renewed activity and con- 
tentment in life. Especially in these 
strenuous days everybody needs an 
occasional outing or change of mood. 
In confirmation of this, is not the prac- 
tice of our chief magistrate a notable 
example? There are others in high 
positions, who are manifestly fond of 
recreation, who, no doubt, have realized 
its invigorating effects. 

Let the inland dweller plan to visit 
the seaside, and the denizen of the city 
go to the hill towns, and the change 
will be complete, and the results most 
beneficial. 

And why should not every family, 
according to its respective needs and 
means, plan a yearly outing for its sev- 
eral members? A summer vacation, 
though brief, is the best of tonics. It 
may be far less expensive than a doc- 
tor's bill. By its influence, life becomes 
more significant and inspiring. In the 
field of labor the trend of modern 
thought is for fewer hours of concen- 
trated effort, and more time for recre- 
ation and self improvement. Is not 
the saying strictly true, "The life is 
more than meat, and the body is more 
than raiment"? 




HOUSEHOLD ART 

AINT PAUL thought 'woman 
should learn in silence.' To the 

present day his words have had 

profound influence over the conduct of 
women. But times have gradually 
changed, and larger light and broader 
education have emancipated woman 
from many an old-time custom. With 
all due deference to the opinion of Paul, 



certainly in many places and on many 
occasions women are no longer silent 
listeners. Witness the countless 
women's clubs and conferences, the 
temperance unions, the mothers' coun- 
cils and congresses. In fact, women are 
diligently seeking for information and 
cultivation in the broadest sense. They 
are learning to help themselves,- and, 
consequently, are helping each other. 

Once woman as teacher was rare to 
meet. To-day young women in large 
numbers are trained in special schools 
and colleges to teach, and their work 
is done both scientifically and effec- 
tively. In civilized lands there are, 
even, some schools of domestic science 
for women, and the number of these 
is increasing; and, besides, household 
economics is now taught as a branch 
in many other schools and institutions 
of learning. More and more home- 
making is coming to be regarded as an 
art. And this is the sign of the times, 
that woman's chief work has come to 
be recognized as an art, and not as .the 
drudgery of housekeeping. For art 
means work and something more. It 
involves thought, intelligence, and feel- 
ing. "Art," says Tolstoy, "is one of 
the two organs of human progress. 
By words man interchanges thoughts: 
by the forms of art he interchanges 
feelings. And this with all men, not 
only of the present time, but also of 
the past and of the future." 

Not long since we heard a young 
woman say that she was a member of 
two luncheon clubs. Once a week she 
went to the city to attend a club of 
former schoolmates and friends. The 
object was to cultivate social relations 
and learn the progress each was mak- 
ing in her respective calling in life. 
From every point of view, it is plain that 
the progressive woman of the day, instead 
of having everything done for her, as was 
the case with women in the past, is learn- 
ing to think and act for herself. She has 
a. zeal for self-culture and imnrovement. 



SOAP AND WATER 

BOSTON is reported to use daily 
about 147 gallons of water per 
capita of population. From 50 
to 150 are the figures that indicate ap- 
proximately the number of gallons of 
water per capita with which cities and 
suburban towns are furnished daily. 
This shows what a huge stream of water 
must be pouring through all large resi- 
dential places, in order to insure clean- 
liness, health, and comfort. How de- 
pendent we are upon our water sup- 
plies! Everywhere the water problem 
is second to none other in importance 
and significance. The world over water, 
pure and abundant, is an indispen- 
sable condition of health and happi- 
ness, and the situation is growing less 
and less favorable. 

Soap and water, both in the quality 
and the quantity of the article used, 
may be considered as the measure of 
the degree of civilization to which a 
people has advanced. Without a 
goodly supply of the one, life is re- 
stricted ; without a free use of the other, 
civilization is impossible. It behooves 
people to look well to the source of their 
water supply. It means cleanly and 
wholesome living. 

Of course, a small fraction only of 
the water carried in the water pipes 
of a city is used for drinking, cooking, 
or other domestic purposes. The 
greater part is used to generate steam 
and power for innumerable objects, but 
the purity of the supply is none the less 
important. 

The danger of infection from poor 
food is, doubtless, less than that from 
impure water. Almost universally the 
water from wells is thought to be un- 
safe for drinking. Spring water, though 
generally approved, needs be carefully 
tested and analyzed. In case of all 
large water supplies, filtration is neces- 
sary, but this process is only partially 
effective. It does not remove all im- 
niire matter. Rnilinp- seems tn he the 



5°° 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



one safe and sure way to destroy the 
unfriendly germs that are so apt to be 
found in water. 

We sometimes wonder that more 
people do not learn to make use of 
distilled water at least for drinking 
purposes. A proper still is not ex- 
pensive. The process is simple. It 
can be carried on in the average 
kitchen, and the result is absolutely 
pure, soft water. 

Fortunate are they who are situated 
near the source of pure, fresh water. 



FRUIT AS FOOD 

LAST week it was reported that 
36,007 bunches of bananas were 
^landed in Boston from a single 
fruit steamer, the largest number ever 
brought in one vessel. And yet, as the 
same authority §ays, once the banana 
was held to be the most indigestible of 
foods, and it was condemned by prudent 
parents as an unwholesome and dan- 
gerous foe. Likewise tomatoes were 
once shunned as poisonous, and even 
now there are those who believe im- 
plicitly that tomatoes woo cancer. 
The luscious grape-fruit, also, now so 
fashionable, was long despised. 

Thus custom changes, and in the 
process of time long-neglected or for- 
bidden articles of diet come to be es- 
teemed among the choicest of deli- 
cacies. 

Pigs, dates, and the banana are the 
most nutritious of all fruits. The ba- 
nana, it is said, yields about 20 per cent, 
of sugar, about 2 per cent, of proteids, 
5 of starch, and rather more of fat. 
It constitutes the chief food of those 
in many parts of the tropic who are too 
lazy to perform any kind of labor. As 
a people, we are just beginning to ap- 
preciate the merits of the Jamaican 
banana. It is prudent, we presume, 
not to partake too freely of this fruit 
at the close of a hearty meal, for the 
banana is rich enough to constitute the 



chief item of the ordinary luncheon 
for old and young. 

Fruit, fresh and seasonable, may well 
be given a prominent place in every 
dietary; for fruit and nuts are natu- 
ral foods. Modern facilities of trans- 
portation now place these natural 
productions of many climes within the 
reach of all. Thus one's diet may be 
changed without a change of scene. 
But the apple, we surmise, will still re- 
tain its place as the king of fruits. 

WITH this issue the Cook- 
ing-School Magazine is nine 
years old. The numbers 
that compose each volume make a 
very respectable cook-book, while the 
nine volumes embrace a very excel- 
lent encyclopaedia of cookery, together 
with a large amount of extraneous 
reading matter. 

The magazine has become the most 
distinctive, practical, and useful culi- 
nary publication in the world. Almost 
daily our readers are assuring us of its 
timely assistance and its constantly 
increasing value and usefulness in the 
home. In respect to subjects treated, 
the magazine is not experimental; it 
is simply and always 'reliable and pro- 
gressive. It has a single aim and pur- 
pose; and this one thing it does. 

With the kindly aid and intelligent 
co-operation of our readers we hope 
to make each succeeding number more 
useful and valuable to housekeepers 
than the preceding. We intend that 
our patrons shall in no wise be dis- 
appointed. 

In the tenth volume, therefore, of 
the Cooking-School Magazine look out 
for expansion in outlook and general 
improvement in content and make-up 
of the respective issues.

Clam Chowder 
Have ready a quart of clams, those 
of small size being preferable. Pour 
over them a quart of cold water, and 
rinse the clams in this, to free them 
from sand. Pinch off, at this time, 
the black portion of the body, and re- 
move with it the firm, gelatinous tube. 
The black end may also be cut off, if 
desired. Cut the tough portion into

and seasoned with pepper, salt, a 
little butter and cream. Dispose 
the veal in a pyramid in the centre 
of a platter, with nests of spinach 
around it. Put half a cup of olive 
oil in a frying-pan, and, when hot, 
break into it as many eggs as 
nests of spinach. Dip the oil over 
the eggs, to cook soft, drain on a

(Entree at Dinner or main dish for 

Luncheon) 

(7b itrvtfiur at lunehton, Hx 

or tight at Dinner) 
Cook the asparagus as 
above, but remove from the fire before 
it is cooked quite enough to serve. For a 
large bunch of asparagus make a sauce 
of the following ingredients : three table- 
spoonfuls, each, of butter and flour, 
one-fourth a teaspoonful of salt, one 
cup of white broth or water in which 
the asparagus was cooked, and half a 
cup of cream. Add the beaten yolks 
of two eggs, and from one-fourth to 
one-half a cup of grated cheese. F"ut 
the asparagus and sauce in a buttered 
pudding-dish, in alternate layers, having 
the last layer of sauce. Sprinkle each 
layer of sauce with cheese, and add 
buttered cracker crumbs to the last 
layer of sauce. Set the dish 
into the oven to brown the 
crumbs. If preferred, the 
tender portions of the stalks, 
cut into inch lengths before 
cooking, may be used instead 
of the whole stalks. 

Asparagus Timbale, 
Cheese Sauce 
Cook two large bunches of 
asparagus, leaving them a 
little underdone. Use one 
bunch, cut before cooking to the 
height of the mould, to line a mould, 
first lined with paper, and heavily but- 
tered. Make a sauce of two table- 
spoons, each, of butter and flour, salt, 



pepper, and one cup of rich milk or a teaspoonful of salt. Add 
thin cream. Add one cup of asparagus two eggs (one whole egg maj 
tips and the pulp from the rest of the stituted), and beat in, little 
asparagus pushed through a sieve, half a cup of milk. When 
Add, also, the yolks of six 
eggs, and one whole egg, beaten 
until well mixed (four whole 
eggs may also be used), and 
turn the mixture into the pre- 
pared mould. Bake, set on 
several folds of paper, until 
firm in the centre. The mould 
should hold one pint and a half. 



Cheese Sauce 
Melt three tablespoonfuls of 
butter. Cook in it till yellowed 
a slice of onion or a clove of garlic has been about half added, 
in which a gash has been cut. Add mixture very thoroughly. Let 
three tablespoonfuls of flour, a scant hour, or longer, before using 
half- teaspoonful of salt, and a dash ready to cook, heat the rosi 
of paprika. Cook until frothy, then in the hot fat. Dip into th 
add one cup of asparagus water, and 
stir until thickened and boiling, then

Wash half a pound of prunes, cover 
with cold water, and let stand over 
night. Cook until tender. Cut the 
prunes in lengthwise pieces, taking out 
the stones. Add two tablespoonf uls of 
candied orange peel, cut in tiny pieces 
and softened in hot water, a few sliced 
almonds (blanched), if at hand, the 
juice of half a lemon, two or three 
tablespoonfuls of sherry wine, if de- 
sired, half a cup of sugar, the gelatine 
dissolved in a little of the hot prune 
liquid, and hot water to make three cups 
of material, generous measure. Turn 
into a mould, and, when ready to serve, 
unmould and decorate with stuffed 
prunes and whipped cream. One cup 
of double cream, one-third a cup of 
milk, and one-fourth a cup of sugar, 
beaten stiff with a Dover egg-beater, 
will suffice. For the stuffed prunes 
cook about a dozen prunes, removing 
them from the fire before they are 
quite tender. Drain, cut open at the 
side, and take out the stone, then let 
dry in the warming oven. Fill with 
chopped nuts (almonds or pecans) 
mixed with chopped figs or fondant. 
Close securely, and roll in granulated 
sugar. 

Rhubarb Meringue 

Select pink- tinted rhubarb; peel, if 
needed, then cut into inch lengths. In 
a buttered pudding-dish put a layer of 
stale sponge cake, over this dispose a 
layer of the rhubarb, and sprinkle this 
with sugar, a grating of candied orange 
peel, and a few grains of salt. Continue 
the layers until the dish is filled. Bake 
about half an hour, having the dish 
covered for the first ten minutes. 
Beat the whites of three eggs until 
very foamy and nearly dry, then beat 
into them, gradually, three level table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, and continue the 
beating until the mixture becomes very 
glossy. Then cut and fold in three 
level tablespoonfuls of sugar. Spread 
this over the pudding, cooled a little, 



dredge the top with granulated sugar, 
and bake to a delicate fawn color. 
The oven should not be hot enough to 
color the meringue until after ten 
minutes. 

Pineapple Souffle 

(Sweet for Luncheon or Dinner) 
(To strive tight §r mort) 

Cook a cup or more of grated pine- 
apple with three-fourths a cup of sugar 
and the juice of half a lemon until well 
reduced and thick. Beat the whites 
of five eggs with one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful of cream of tartar until dry, then 
gradually beat in the cold pineapple 
mixture. Turn into a two-quart mould, 
buttered and dredged with sugar, set 
into a dish on several folds of paper, 
surround with boiling water, and let 
cook about half an hour. The water 
should not boil during the cooking. 
Serve turned from the mould with 
cream and sugar or a boiled custard. 

Pineapple Cake 

Cream half a cup of butter. Beat 
into it one cup and a half of sugar, 
then add, alternately, half a cup of 
milk and two and one-fourth cups 
(half a pound) of flour, sifted with one- 
fourth a teaspoonful of soda and three- 
fourths a teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar. Lastly beat in the whites of 
five eggs, beaten dry. Bake in two 
layer cake tins. Mix half a cup of 
grated pineapple and the juice of half 
a lemon heated to the boiling-point 
with confectioner's sugar, to make a 
frosting that will not run from the 
cake. Use as a filling between the 
layers and as an icing for the top. 
When the top is covered with the icing, 
brush it over with a little water and 
sprinkle with about a dozen blanched 
pistachio nuts, chopped fine.

After Breakfast Chat 

By Janet M. Hill 

" A BOVEall, study well your sauce: if it fail, disaster is inevitable; if it succeed, place laurel 
XX. leaves in your hair, for you will have conquered. 'A woman who has mastered sauces tits 
on the apex of civilization.' " — Tkt Feasts of Avtolycus. 



GREAT diversity is said to be a 
marked characteristic of Amer- 
ican cookery. This is possi- 
ble on account of the diversity with 
which our markets, stocked from the 
markets of the world, are supplied. 
If we were dependent for fresh prod- 
ucts upon those produced in our own 
land, the same diversity would be 
possible. Even now in the months 
of sowing, when few home-grown 
vegetables are obtainable, radical 
changes may be made daily in our 
food supplies. In city markets, as- 
paragus, string beans, beets, cress, 
radishes, cucumbers, and celery are 
found, choice in quality and at prices 
but little higher than those of the reg- 
ular months of production, while spin- 
ach and lettuce are sold at the regular 
rates. In the country a hot-bed may 
furnish lettuce and radishes, which are 
easily grown. A headless barrel, turned 
over a root of rhubarb, will give stalks 
as delicate as the heart could wish; 
while cress, dandelion, sorrel, dock, 
plantain, and cowslip are to be had 
for the picking. 

In the fish market, clams have su- 
perseded oysters, and shad, brook 
trout, mackerel, blue-fish, pompano, 
and white fish from the Great Lakes, 
are all abundant. 

But the rich diversity attributed 
to American cookery is true, only when 



it refers to cookery as a whole, and not 
of cookery in individual families. 

There are few things upon which 
the average family is more conserva- 
tive than upon food, where, as a rule, 
the same articles, cooked in identi- 
cally the same manner, are served day 
after day, year in and year out. 

Lentils, like beans, are inexpensive, 
and contain a goodly proportion of 
the nitrogenous element found in meat 
and fish. They are more easily di- 
gested than beans, but they are rarely 
prepared for the home table. 

Nine people out of ten will not eat 
olive oil, though they know it is con- 
ducive to health and longevity. Nay 
more, they will not even taste to see 
if, perchance, it might not be agree- 
able to them. If they ever learn to 
like an oil-dressed salad, it is inad- 
vertently. As for cooking in olive 
oil, the first cost is sufficient reason 
why it should not be provided for 
those who would make a careless use 
of it; but the woman, who takes time 
to prepare with her own hands, at 
least, some of the dishes that appear 
on her table, will thoroughly enjoy 
cooking in olive oil, and articles thus 
cooked lose much of the objectionable 
feature justly attributed to this form 
of cooking. Try frying eggs in olive 
oil. Prom appearance you would say 
they had been poached in boiling 



After Breakfast Chat

water. Do not heat the oil to the 
smoking- point; for the high degree 
of heat to which it may be raised be- 
fore it burns is its chief point of ex- 
cellence. Test with a bread crumb, 
to determine the proper temperature; 
for, even when too hot for frying, the 
oil will not appear hot. Used with 
care and strained after use, the oil 
will have the appearance of that fresh 
from the bottle, and may be used again 
and again. 

On "The Theory of Frying" Bril- 
lat-Savarin says to his chef: "I say 
nothing about choosing oils or fats, 
because the various cook-books which 
I have placed in your library give 
sufficient information on that hand. 
Do not forget, however, when you 
have any of those trout, weighing 
scarcely more than a quarter of a 
pound, and caught in running brooks 
that murmur far from the capital, — 
do not forget, I say, to fry them in 
the very finest olive oil you have. 
This simple dish, properly sprinkled 
and served up with slices of lemon, 
is worthy of being offered to a cardinal." 

Brook trout, weighing scarcely more 
than one-fourth a pound, are now 
to be had for the catching, in all our 
mountain brooks "that murmur far 
from the capital"; but, alas I too often 
they are valued less by the dweller 
in the country than by those whom 
the city holds, these joyous spring days, 
in durance vile. 

But dainty speckled trout are not 
the only fish that is delectable in May. 
In no country are fish more plentiful 
or of finer quality than in this; but 
here fish are eaten from choice by the 
few, rather than by the many. Much 
of this discrimination against fish is 
due to the fact that it is not served 
attractively. When all refuse is re- 
moved, and only clean fillets of fish, 
every portion of which may be eaten, 
are sent to the table, the objectionable 
features are done away with. 



Pish contains identically the same 
elements as meat; and, as the muscles 
have large fibres and little connective 
tissue, compared with meat, it is much 
more easily digested than meat. Thus 
fish commends itself to the family 
table, around which both old and 
young, the sedentary and the active, 
are gathered. 

Shad is a delicacy in fish, during the 
May time. They are usually served 
at least once in the season for the sake 
of their delicate savor, but the bones 
are objectionable. For broiling and 
planking, the backbone and many of 
the smaller bones can be easily taken 
out. Often the creamed or broiled 
roe is served above the fish, but this 
only complicates the removal of the 
bones; and it were better that the roe 
be sent to the table in an au gratin 
dish. The delicate and elusive flavor 
of brook trout and shad should not be 
lost in rich sauces, but a green salad, 
properly dressed, is a necessary ad- 
junct. Left-over shad, as also blue- 
fish, make truly delectable salads. 

The standard varieties of white 
fish need rich sauces and careful cook- 
ing, and are amenable to great diver- 
sity in their service. In the cooking 
of all fish, we should read from the 
classic authors, Walton, Baron Brisse, 
Savarin, and Thackeray, and profit by 
the reading. Armed with the en- 
thusiasm engendered by a perusal of 
the works of these writers, who could 
not take up the casserole and the fry- 
ing-pan, prepare court bouillon, fish 
stock, and glaze, select choice oil, 
onion, garlic, green pepper, and a 
bouquet garni, and assay to send to 
the table fish possessed of the am- 
brosial qualities described by the elect ? 

It is yet too early for spring chickens, 
but fowl can be used to advantage in 
those dishes in which a first cooking 
of some length is not impracticable. 
Indeed, for many purposes, the rich 
flavor of a fowl is needed for the best 



results. Among such dishes are cro- 
quettes; and these can be so made 
that they will hold scant relationship 
to the "glorified" hash so often served 
as croquettes. Let the pieces of chick- 
en be of good size, cut nearly half an 
inch square, and with a knife, then 
no doubt will be as to whether the 
dish be "fish or flesh or good red 
herring." As to the sauce which holds 
these tangible bits together, you can- 
not depart much from the conven- 
tional standard. Make the sauce of 
such volume that each bit of meat 
will be separated from all others by 
the surrounding sauce, and the whole, 
when cold, will be of a consistency to 
handle with ease. Use the recipe 
given for clam croquettes; but let 
chicken broth, which jellies when cold, 
take the place of the clam broth. 
The flavoring of the sauce is a nice 
matter. "A pianissimo touch" of gar- 
lic, or a slice of onion cooked in the 
butter of which the roux is made, will 
be found advantageous, so also a 
sprinkling of fine-chopped parsley in 
the sifted bread crumbs used for the 
final crumbing.

Seasonable Recipes 

(Concluded from page 509) 
Press enough of these through a puree 
sieve to fill a cup. Simmer this pulp 
with half a cup of sugar five to ten 
minutes, then set aside to become cold. 
Beat three-fourths a cup of double 
cream and three-fourths a cup of single 
cream from the top of a can of milk 
until firm to the bottom of the bowl. 
Turn the fruit puree over the cream, 
and cut and fold the two together. 
Turn the mixture into a quart mould 
lined with paper after the usual man- 
ner, filling the mould to overflow. 
Spread a paper over the top of the 
mixture, press down the cover, and let 
stand packed in equal measures of ice 
and salt about two hours. Garnish 
the parfait, when removed from the 
mould, with two halves of apricot hold- 
ing a little whipped cream. Sprinkle 
the cream with chopped pistachio nuts. 
This parfait is not over-sweet, and will 
freeze in less than two hours. The 
syrup in the can, cooked with half a 
cup of sugar five or six minutes and 
cooled, may be used as a sauce for the 
parfait. 

Rhubarb Jellied with Candied 
Orange Peel 
Cut a pound and half of rhubarb 
into pieces an inch in length, sprinkle 
over it a cup and a half of sugar, 
and about a fourth a cup of candied 
orange peel, cut in tiny bits, also a 
few tablespoon fuls of hot water. 
Cover and bake, or cook directly over 
the fire, until the rhubarb is tender. 
For three cups of material soften one- 
third a package of gelatine in one-third 
a cup of cold water; and, when well 
hydrated, turn into the hot rhubarb. 
Pour into a mould to harden. Serve 
with thin cream, sweetened and frothed 
with a whip chum. Decorate the 
cream with figures cut from candied 
orange peel. Soften the peel, if needed, 
by cooking it in sugar and water.

When the Italian cooks Corn-meal 

THERE are many in this country 
who cherish the conceit that the 
use of Indian corn for human food is 
chiefly confined to the United States, 
but immense quantities of maize are 
grown in Servia, in Bulgaria, in Rou- 
mania, — in fact, all over the southern 
part of Europe. 

The Italian is not given to corn breads 
and such. He cooks his meal not very 
different from our hasty pudding: it is 
the trimmings and fixings that give 
renown to his polenta. The corn- 
meal is stirred into rapidly boiling 
water, and salted to taste. It is cooked 
slowly until done. Frequently a few 
cloves of garlic and half a cup of olive 
oil are added. The mass is then turned 
into a dish, cooled, cut in slices, and 
heated in a hot tomato or brown sauce, 
or it is fried in hot oil, sprinkled with 
cheese, and served with onions fried in 
oil, to which tomatoes may be added 
at option. 

If the polenta is to be eaten as soon 
as cooked, grated cheese is added to 
it. Another method of cooking it is 
to fry some onions in olive oil. When 
brown, add a quart of tomatoes and a 
quart of water. In this two cupfuls 
of corn-meal and a teaspoonful of salt 
are stirred slowly. Then the kettle is 
drawn to the back of the stove, and the 
mixture cooked until done. 

The Italians are more fond of birds 
and fowl than of beef and pork, and 
meats are usually stewed or boiled, and 



For distinguished occasions the po- 
lenta is shaped, after cooking, into a 
round mould, to give it form. It is 
then turned out, and the centre hol- 
lowed out. Stewed reed birds are 
placed in the centre, and the rich gravy 
is poured over all. It is then placed 
in the oven for a few moments before 
serving. Eleanor M. Lucas, 

Several Sandwiches 

A FRIEND returns from Cuba and 
offers her afternoon callers soda 
crackers, on which she has placed 
a square of Swiss cheese (they won- 
dered whether the particular cheese in 
question had penetrated to the utter- 
most parts of the earth), and on top 
of the aforesaid cheese a thicker square 
of guava jelly. We usually see this 
jelly in small round boxes, but in Cuba 
it is packed in square wooden boxes. 

Cold lamb sandwiches may be made 
more palatable by the addition of some 
carefully bestowed currant jelly, and 
an equally interesting diversion in the 
sandwich line is the addition of a paste 
made from cold lamb and capers spread 
between whole-wheat bread. 

A most refreshing and tasty sand- 
wich contains a liberal allowance of 
water-cress, some shavings of Bermuda 
or Spanish onion, and sufficient horse- 
radish to give the necessary snap. 

The far-famed housewife, who as- 
serted that the sale of rags ought to 
buy the brooms, now contends that

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



rises to the point of public proclama- 
tion in favor of the scrubbing of every 
fowl before he goes to the roasting-pan. 
Every self-respecting bird should be 
accorded the bath he never had, and 
a Turkish bath at that, with soap and 
suds. 

Follow the treatment with a refresh- 
ing shower bath under the cold spigot, 
and wrap your feathered friend in a 
linen towel to absorb the surplus water.

Novel Strawberries and Cherries 

THE strawberry is a fruit often 
imitated in marzipan, — almond 
paste confectionery, — but, at fifteen 
cents apiece, they are rather dearer 
than a forced crop of real berries from 
a hot-bed, or those sent from Florida 

in winter. 

• The newest strawberries are not made 

of candy, but are of cake, — cream cake. 
Small pieces, cut from layer cake the 
size of a large berry and approximating 
in form, are dipped in an icing colored 
a true strawberry red. Deposited in 
frilled paper cases, and finished with 
such green hulls as come for the mar- 
zipan berries and artificial flowers, these 
tiny brilliant cakelets are well adapted 
to the garniture of choice arrange- 
ments of petits fours. They look very 
enticing under the lighted candles or 
softly shaded lamps of an afternoon 
reception or supper table. The sug- 
gestion is one of which many a hostess 
can wisely avail herself when, as in 
summer, she may be far from pastry 
shops and caterers. 

Upon a table set for a reception on 
February 22, when cherries appropri- 
ately predominated, these strawberries 
were also seen, and attracted more at- 
tention than the cherries in various 
forms, — the usual frozen cherries, the 
silver dishes of crystalized ones for a 
bonne-bouche, and, most novel of all, 
cherries that were not cherries at all, 
except in appearance. They were made 



of chestnut paste, moulded in balls, and 
daintily glac£d in red, which readily 
melted in one's mouth. These are a 
new suggestion for Washington's Birth- 
day, or a cherry festival the coming 
June. For a "strawberry supper," for 
the benefit of a church, or at a country 
estate for a family party, these forms of 
strawberries and cherries would carry 
out the idea of the occasion very prettily. 
Instead of the chestnut paste, which 
might not be easily obtained, almond 
paste could be easily made, and fla- 
vored with kirsch or maraschino, for 
both are cherry cordials, and often 
used for flavoring sweet dishes, candy, 
and ices. Even bitter almond sug- 
gests the flavor of cherry pits so often 
used in various cherry dishes, pies, and 
preserves. 

If a recipe for the almond paste be 
needed, refer to the December issue of 
this magazine, in the leading article on 
Holland and the dainties appropriate 
for the feast of St. Nicholas. The recipe 
is headed "Marshpeins," and was ob- 
tained in Amsterdam. Marshpeins, or 
marchpanes, or marzipan, as it is va- 
riously spelled, is a very ancient form 
of sweetmeat, as valued now every- 
where as it was in the palaces of nobles 
centuries ago. This recipe is about as it 
is usually made at home. Confectioners, 
however, omit the use of eggs, and make 
it by a different process. 

Possibly small cream puffs could be 
made for the mock strawberries, but, to 
all appearances, they were carefully 
manipulated portions of layer cream 
cake, freshly iced.

For Cleaning Rugs, etc. 

THE housekeepers who are freeing 
themselves of carpets are fast 
solving the problem of the " annual up- 
roar" of house-cleaning. They find 
that the general "tearing up" is over, 
and the rooms are now easily and 
quietly cleaned and put in order. The

following recipe makes one of the finest 
compounds for cleaning Smyrna rugs, 
chenille draperies, plush-covered 
couches and furniture, etc. : — 

Shave- two and one-half bars of Ivory 
soap fine, and boil until it is dissolved 
in one and one-half quarts of soft water. 
Add half a pound of borax. Boil ten 
minutes longer. Steep three ounces of 
soap bark in one quart of water for half 
an hour, and strain. Add one-fourth a 
pint of aqua ammonia, put into one 
quart of cold water. Mix all together, 
and add water enough to make good 
six gallons. Soft water is preferred. 
Set aside to cool, and cover to keep 
clean. When ready to use, dust the 
articles well and apply with a good 
large brush, rubbing vigorously. Then 
wipe with a cloth until quite dry. For 
doing large rugs it is desirable to have two 
people working, one to follow up with the 
dry cloth as soon as a space is rubbed. 

The recipe sells for twenty-five cents, 
and is the cheapest cleaner I have ever 
bought. I make the entire recipe at 
the cost of about fifty cents. It will 
supply my wants for a year. One 
woman made it for others, and sold it, 
when wanted, at twenty cents per gal- 
lon. Sadbttb Harrington. 



A Good Morning Drink 
Every one ought to drink water the 
first thing in the morning before break- 
fast. 

As soon as you get up, brush the teeth 
and rinse out the mouth with cold water, 
and gargle the throat with cold water. 
Then take a glass of either hot or cold 
water, not ice cold, but just cool, and 
squeeze into the water the juice of an 
orange. Drink this about half an hour 
before breakfast. This cleanses the 
stomach, and puts it in good condition 
to digest the breakfast. However, 
there are some cases where any acid 
will disagree. In such cases, of course, 
the water should be taken without the 



A PRETTY, inexpensive, yet sim- 
ple and sanitary method of treat- 
ing old or unsightly kitchen walls 
is to, first, paper them in the usual 
manner, then, when thoroughly dry, 
apply a thin coating of white varnish. 
This treatment renders the paper 
impervious to moisture, preserves the 
colors, and is easily kept clean. It is 
equally good for laundry or nursery 
or any room much used. Many dollars 
may thus be saved, as paper thus 
treated will last ever so much longer, 

L. H. 

Dear Editor, — I want to tell your 
readers of my latest find in hygienic 
and "labor-saving devices." Many 
people think that, when washing dishes, 
one or two more don't matter much, but 
after all they do count, if they are cook- 
ing dishes that need be scraped or 
soaked before washing. 

Now we do not live in the "pie belt," 
but I have always noticed that, if we 
have a really good pie, — rhubarb, berry, 
cherry, apple, lemon, custard, or any 
other variety of the genus pie, — none of 
it ever goes begging. And, if on any 
occasion the main part of my dinner 
or luncheon be planned on more than 
ordinarily economical lines, I am always 
sure, if I have a pie with a tender, well- 
cooked crust to finish up with, the 
meal will meet with favor. 

Now as to my "find." It is a pie 
plate made of wood pulp, — nothing but 
pure wood pulp and water. The plate 
is very porous. You first carefully 
dry the plate, and then bake your pie 
on it. The absorbent wood pulp takes 
up any surplus fat in the lower crust, 
and, at the same time, as the plate is a 
good conductor of heat, the lower crust 
is well baked, and a light, flaky, well- 
baked undercrust is insured. Then, 
when the pie is eaten, the plate, which 
costs but one cent, is burned. When 
another pie is desired, a fresh, new plate, 



Some Cuban Dulces 

By Mrs. L. O. Harris 



DELICATELY tinted, either in 
solid colors or variegated in 
hue, cut in all manner of grace- 
ful and fanciful shapes, nothing could 
be more seductive to the eye than 
Cuban dulces, and nothing is more dis- 
appointing to the taste; that is, of a 
foreigner. The Cubans themselves are 
exceedingly fond of them, and munch 
them at all hours. With few excep- 
tions they are cloyingly, even mawk- 
ishly sweet, and lacking distinctive 
flavor. Many of them are composed 
largely of the yolk of egg f and this al- 
ways tastes as if it were not sufficiently 
cooked. Others, which are more like 
our meringues, are very much nicer, 
and of these there is a greater variety 
than we make. 

Many of these famous dulces are 
truly named boucMes; for in size they 
are just about a mouthful. The Cuban 
is very fond of sponge cake, but it is 
not the dry cake that we know as such. 
An exceeding moistness is its sine qua 
non, and this is obtained by soaking it 
in flavored syrup, in wine or cordial 
or fruit brandy. They are baked in 
all sorts of fetching shapes. One, a 
slender cone, about as long as the fore- 
finger, is particularly dainty. 

The almond pastes, of which there 
are several varieties, are most delicious. 
One made of ground nuts, with a good 
deal of honey in the mixture, cannot 
be surpassed ; while another of chopped 
almonds, stirred in with prodigal hand, 
is equally good. 

There are slender, loaf-shaped sugar- 
and-egg confections, of crystalline 
whiteness, that never fail to awaken 
the curiosity of the stranger who sees 
them for the first time. These are 
panelos, and are used by the Cubans 
to sweeten the hot milk, which they 
all drink with so much zest, also the 



coffee, which is their national drink. 
The Cubans, perhaps with the best of 
reasons, have always regarded un- 
boiled milk with disfavor, as being un- 
wholesome. They drink it very hot, 
with the faintest of sweetening; and the 
panelo, delicately fashioned of white of 
egg and loaf sugar, then hardened in 
the oven, sweetens the cup of milk 
juste au point. They will keep indefi- 
nitely if protected against the air and 
the ant, the pest of Cuban housekeep- 
ing. 

The Cubans crystalize almost every- 
thing, and successfully. Many of these 
confections are new to the foreigner, 
such as the pawpaw and the guava. 
The latter preserves all of the delight- 
ful flavor; but the pawpaw, while beau- 
tiful to look upon, has no more flavor 
than preserved watermelon rind. They 
do marvelous things with the sweet 
potato, and one would never recognize 
the plebeian root in its new coat. 

The kumquat, that fairylike Japan- 
ese orange, which you take at one 
mouthful (rind, seeds, and all), the lime, 
the grape-fruit, and the orange they 
convert into translucent cates of dis- 
tinctive and delicious flavor. The 
loquat, too, the Japanese plum, makes 
a confection of dear delight. Of guava 
jelly and paste nothing need be said 
here; but they have a guava marma- 
lade, little known outside the island 
which is very good indeed, and 
cheap. The guava cream, which 
comes in tins, is also cheap, and makes 
a rarely nice filling for layer cakes, 
also for the pudding, which Americans 
call guava duff. Jellied cocoanut, 
which is the nut in its unripe state, 
served ice-cold, with powdered sugar 
and maraschino, is as good as anything 
ever served on Mount Olympus. The 
cocoanut milk is one of the favorite 




drinks in the cafes, and it is as 
much liked by the men as by the 



The Cubans are not to be surpassed 
in the variety and delightful flavor of 
their ices, and these the confectioners 
furnish at most reasonable rates. If 
you order pineapple ice for dessert, it 
comes to you frozen in a hollowed pine. 
Grape-fruit and orange ice comes in 
the rinds of those fruits, heaped up as 
though just plucked from the tree. If 
a sapota ice, it is served in the lustrous 
rough brown, pear-shaped skin of the 
fruit, and, when cut into lengthwise 
slices, discloses a rose-red pulp, most 
beautiful to the eye and most luscious 
to the taste. The sour-sop, which 
tastes like cotton soaked in vinegar, 
when eaten as a fruit, makes, strangely 
enough, one of the most delectable of 
all ices. 

A most Oriental-looking dish is frozen 
pomegranate seeds. Its flavor is not 
particularly distinctive, unless wedded 



to that of some other fruit, but its 
beauty is most delicate and appealing. 
The sugar apple, whose outward ap- 
pearance suggests a cross between the 
pineapple and the burr artichoke, and 
whose interior is packed full of cottony 
capsules, each of which has its ink- 
black seed, tastes much like sugar-cane, 
and furnishes another good ice. The 
lorioni, which are made of cream, eggs, 
sugar, and powdered macaroons, are 
Neapolitan in origin, and are the same 
as the famous biscuits glacis of New 
Orleans. 

In a warm climate, man solaces him- 
self with many cooling drinks. Not 
only limes and lemons furnish these, 
but the tamarind also. The brown 
seeds, so sour that the bare mention 
of them is enough to lock the jaws, are 
packed in wide-mouthed earthen jars, 
and sugared heavily. The resulting 
juice, added in small quantity to a glass 
of crushed ice, makes refreshing tama- 
rindade. 



May Rain 

By Marie Gregory 



Subtile and lithe, the shafts of the rain, — 
In shivering gray, May leads her train. 
Dun procession of sunless hours, 
Sodden skies with their bunting showers, 
Till over my soul the rain-cloud creeps, 
And every gladness of Spring-time sleeps. 
My soul, it is thou who art dark and grayl 
With iinkle of music come rains of May. 
The dull persistence of dripping eaves 
Is melody sweet to the greening leaves, 
And glinting rain as the dark cloud lowers 
Is Piper of Hamelin to eager flowers. 
Sheen silver of mist is weaving a spell 
That the witch of the rain will never tell 
Through gossamer web, tear wet as with dew, 
Shine the myriad lights of the rainbow's hue,

Corn-and-Tomato Soup 

Press a cup of canned tomatoes 
through a sieve. Cook a cup of canned 
corn, half an onion, a piece of bay leaf, 
and a cup of water in a double boiler 
twenty minutes, then press through a 
sieve. Cook one-fourth a cup of flour 
and a teaspoonful of salt in one-fourth 
a cup of butter. Add three cups of 
milk, and, when the sauce has boiled, 
add the hot tomato and corn, with 
more seasoning, if needed. 

Sauces for Fillet of Beef 

Bernaise sauce, given on page x of 
the January, 1905, magazine, and the 
sauce given with the veal cutlets, 
luncheon style, omitting the cream, on 
page 455, are both suitable to serve with 
a fillet of beef. Creole sauce is partic- 
ularly good, when green peppers and 
tomatoes' are seasonable. 

Creole Sauce 

Slice fine an onion and half a green 
pepper (plunge in boiling water, and 
rub off the skin, then discard the seeds), 
and fry them in three tablespoonfuls 
of butter until yellowed and softened. 
Then add a clove of garlic in which a 
gash has been cut, and three table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Let cook until 
frothy, then add a cup of rich brown 
stock. Scald and peel two large ripe 
tomatoes, cut in coarse pieces, and 
press out the seeds. Strain the sauce 



over the tomatoes, add salt and pa- 
prika, and let cook ten minutes. Be- 
fore serving, remove any butter that 
separates from the sauce. 

Chestnut Souffle 

Let two dozen large chestnuts, shelled 
and blanched, boil until tender; drain, 
and press through a sieve. Melt 
one-fourth a cup of butter, and cook 
in it one-fourth a cup of flour and 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Then add 
one cup of thin cream or rich milk, and 
cook and stir until boiling. Then add 
the chestnut pulp and half a cup of 
sugar, and stir until smoothly blended 
and hot. Remove from the fire, and 
beat in the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs and a teaspoonful of vanilla ex- 
tract, and fold in the whites of four 
eggs, beaten dry. Bake in a buttered 
pudding-dish, set on several folds of 
paper, in a dish of hot water, until well 
risen and firm in the centre. Serve 
with creamy or Sabayon sauce. This 
recipe will serve eight or ten people.

Qobky 1033— E. S. P., Poughkecpsie, N.Y.: 
"Recipes for Bar-le-duc, chocolate peppermint 
creams, and candied grape-fruit peel." 

Bar-le-Duc Preserves 
When the currant season comes, we 
plan to try to work out a recipe for 
Bar-le-duc currants, but, as many of 
our subscribers would, possibly, like 
to try a few glasses at the same time, 
we will give now such general direc- 
tions as we think should produce the 
desired confection. Take selected cur- 
rants of large size, one by one, and with 
a pair of tiny embroidery scissors care- 
fully cut the skin on one side, making 
a slit of perhaps one-fourth an inch. 
Through this, with a sharp needle, re- 
move the seeds, one at a time, to pre- 
serve the shape of the currants. Take 
the weight of the currants in strained 
honey, and, when hot, add the cur- 
rants. Let simmer two or three min- 
utes. Then seal as jelly. If the cur- 
rants liquefy the honey too much, ear- 
fully skim them out. Reduce the 
syrup, at a gentle simmer, to the desired 
consistency. Then store as before. 

Chocolate Peppermint Creams 

Prepare fondant (see December, 1905, 

magazine) . After the fondant has stood

The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



twenty-four hours, take out a part of 
it, flavor with peppermint, knead and 
shape into a long roll an inch in diam- 
eter. If the fondant be sticky, knead 
in XXXX confectioner's sugar. Cut 
the roll into rounds, and set these on 
waxed paper to dry off. Melt the rest 
of the fondant in a double boiler, add- 
ing a few drops of water, and stirring 
constantly all the time. Add melted 
chocolate and vanilla to tint and flavor 
as desired. Dip the rounds into the 
melted fondant, and set on waxed paper 
to dry. These creams are also coated 
with sweet, coating chocolate, which 
may be purchased of a confectioner. 
The price is thirty or thirty-five cents 
per pound. Melt the coating over hot 
water. Do not add water to it. Knead 
thoroughly until the heat has left it. 
Then roll the centres in it, one at a time. 
Rub over the chocolate with the finger, 
to completely cover the centre, and 
make the coating uniform in the thick- 
ness. Then set them on waxed paper. 

Candied Grape-fruit Peel 

Cut the peel in quarter sections. 
Then carefully peel from the fruit. 
Let stand over night in cold water, to 
which salt is added, — a teaspoonful to 
a quart. Weigh when taken from the 
fruit. Cook the peel in water to cover 
until tender. Then drain. Make a 
syrup of sugar equal in weight to the 
peel, and half a cup of water to each 
cup of sugar. Skim and put in the 
peel. Let simmer until the syrup is 
well reduced. Then cook, and very 
gently stir until the peel is coated with 
the syrup. Spread the peel on agate 
plates to dry. 

Query 1024. — H. H. C, Boston: "Recipe 
for cake to be baked in Waldorf tins that will 
use the whites of six eggs." 

Angel Cake 

To three-fourths a cup of egg whites, 
take three-fourths a cup, each, of sugar 
and flour, a scant half-teaspoonful of 



cream of tartar, one-fourth a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
The flour should weigh three ounces. 
Beat the whites of eggs with the salt 
until very foamy. Add the cream of 
tartar, and beat dry. Then gradually 
beat in the flavoring and sugar, and 
cut and fold in the flour. 



Query 1025. — Mrs. A. C. M., Pictou, N.S.: 
"Recipe for pineapple marmalade and a hot 
pineapple pudding." 

Pineapple Marmalade 

Remove the skin and eyes from the 
pineapples. Then grate the pulp from 
the hard centre. Weigh the pulp and 
juice. Allow the juice of a lemon and 
three-fourths to one pound of sugar to 
each pound of pulp and juice. Let the 
pineapple simmer over the fire until 
well scalded. Then add the lemon 
juice and the sugar, made hot in the 
oven, and let cook until, when tested on 
a cold saucer, no watery liquid separates 
from the mass. Store as jelly. 

Pineapple Omelet 

(Illustrated in " Practical Cooking and Serving* 1 ) 

Melt two level tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter. In it cook two level tablespoonfuls 
of flour with one-fourth a teaspoonful 
of salt. Add one cup of grated pine- 
apple, juice and pulp, one-fourth a 
cup of sugar, and one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice. Stir and cook until the 
boiling-point is reached. Then remove 
from the fire, and beat the mixture into 
the yolks of five eggs, beaten very light 
Then fold in the whites of five eggs, 
beaten dry. Melt two tablespoonfuls 
of butter in a large omelet pan. Pour 
in the mixture, and let stand on the 
top of the range, to become "set" on 
the bottom. Then cook in the oven 
until a knife cut down into the omelet 
comes out clean. Score entirely across 
the top at right angles to the handle 
of the pan. Fold the omelet at the 
scoring, and turn onto a hot platter. 



Sift confectioner's sugar thickly over 
the top. Score diagonally with a hot 
iron. Serve surrounded with a second 
cup of grated pineapple, cooked with 
a little sugar and lemon juice, or with 
half slices of pineapple cooked in syrup. 
This omelet makes a particularly nice 
dessert. It will serve six or more.

QuSry 1016. — L.B.L.: " Explicit directions 
for a pot roast." 

Pot Roast 
Select a solid piece of meat from the 
round, or, if a roast of small size be 
desired, it may be cut from the aitch 
bone. Cut a slice of salt pork into tiny 
bits, and try out the fat either in an 
iron frying-pan or a kettle. Put in the 
meat, and let cook until browned on all 
sides. An onion cut in thin slices may 
be browned with the meat. Add about 
a pint of water, less rather than more. 
Cover the kettle, and let the meat sim- 
mer very gently until tender, adding 
a little water occasionally, if needed. 
Add salt, when the meat is about half 
cooked. The meat needs be cooked 
from four to six hours. Serve the gravy 
in a dish apart. If preferred, thicken 
with roux (flour cooked in butter) for 
a sauce. Strain the gravy or sauce 
before serving. 

QuSry 10*7. — Madame G. E. L., Montreal, 
Can.: "Recipes for boiled and uncooked icing, 
and plain pancakes. Have tried the recipe 
for truffled fish, but, when turned from the 
mould, it was like water. Tried the sponge 
drops, using one-half cup of flour, but the paste 
spread too much and was heavy. Do you use 
prepared flour for cake?" 

Boiled Icing 
Boil one cup of sugar, one-eighth a 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar, and one- 
fourth a cup of boiling water until the 
syrup, when turned from the spoon, 
makes a heavy and continuous thread, 
or until the syrup registers 238 F. on the 
sugar thermometer. Do not stir after 
the sugar is dissolved. Wash down 



the crystals from the sides of the pan. 
Then cover the saucepan for three or 
four minutes, that the steam may re- 
move any remaining grains of sugar. 
Have ready the white of an egg beaten 
dry. Continue beating while the syrup 
is poured in a fine stream into the egg. 
Beat for some minutes, occasionally, 
until the icing is cold. Then flavor 
and spread upon the cake. 

Confectioner's Icing 
Stir boiling water, milk, fruit juice, 
cream, or syrup, into sifted confec- 
tioner's sugar, to make a paste that will 
not run from the cake. This frosting 
will harden and thicken a little when 
cold. The sugar, which should be four 
X (XXXX), is as fine and soft as flour. 

Plain Pancakes 
Sift together two and three-fourths 
cups of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and four teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
Mix to a batter with about two cups 
of sweet milk. Bake on a griddle. 
These are better when made with two 
eggs and two and a half cups of flour, 
or even with one egg. Add the yolks 
with the milk and the stiff-beaten 
whites last. 

Truffled Fish 
There is nothing wrong with the 
recipe for truffled fish. It needs be 
cooked at a low temperature, below 
the boiling-point of water, to avoid 
the curdling of the eggs and the coagu- 
lation of the juices of the fish. A 
slight separation always takes place, 
and, if the fish be unmoulded on the 
serving-dish, the liquid can be taken 
up with a bit of cheese-cloth. Halibut, 
salmon, bass, or flounder, give good 
results. Cod and haddock are not 
suitable for this dish. 

Sponge Drops 

Another yolk of eggoratablespoonful 

or two of flour may be added to the 

quantities given in the recipe, but we 



5*4 



The Boston Cooking-School Magazine 



suspect that the trouble is with the 
mixing rather than in the recipe. A 
sponge cake, proper, is made light by 
the expansion of the air added to the 
mixture in beaten eggs. If, in adding 
the flour and sugar to the beaten eggs, 
the mixture be stirred, thus breaking 
down the bubbles of air, the cake will 
be heavy and tough. Notice that the 
only motions indicated are beating and 
"cutting and folding." We do not use 
prepared flour for cake. No "rising" 
ingredient is called for in a sponge cake. 

Qussy 1028. — M. L. H. : " Recipes for cream 
of peanut soup, brown cheese balls, bread 
and butter crisps for soup, braised beef 
tongue, braised calf s liver, and prune cock- 
tail." 

Cream-of-Peanut Soup 

Cook a cup of roasted peanuts, 
shelled and blanched, in boiling water 
until tender. Then press them through 
a sieve. There should be about a pint 
of thin pur£e. Make a sauce of one- 
fourth a cup, each, of butter and flour, 
half a teaspoonf ul of salt, and a pint of 
milk. Add the pur6e and enough hot 
milk to make the soup of the desired 
consistency. Vegetable flavoring may 
be added by cooking bits of vegetable 
in the butter of which the sauce is made. 

Brown Cheese Balls 

We do not know that the adjective 
"brown" can be applied to cheese balls 
made by the following recipe, but, as 
we know of no other recipe to which 
such term could be applied, we give it. 
Mix together a cup and a half of grated 
cheese (American factory cheese an- 
swers well) and one-fourth a teaspoon- 
f ul, each, of salt and paprika. Then cut 
and fold this mixture into the whites 
of three eggs, beaten dry. Shape in 
small balls, roll these in sifted cracker 
crumbs, and fry in deep fat to a delicate 
brown color. The balls will cook in 
less than a minute, and must be re- 
moved at once from the fat, or they will 
be tough. Drain on soft paper, and 



serve piled, cannon-ball fashion, on a 
lace napkin. Serve with celery and 
pulled bread at the close of dinner or 
with a green vegetable salad before the 
sweet course. 

Bread-and-Butter Crisps for Soup 

Spread bread, cut in half -inch slices, 
with crust removed, then into strips 
or squares, with butter, and set into a 
hot oven to brown the bread. 

Braised Beef Tongue 

Cover a mild-cured tongue with cold 
water. Heat slowly to the boiling- 
point, and let simmer six or eight min- 
utes. Then set the tongue in cold 
water, and remove the skin. Take a 
large earthen casserole, and in it put 
half a cup, each, of small bits of bacon, 
carrot, onion, and celery. Put the 
tongue on these. Add about a pint of 
light stock or water, a piece of bay leaf, 
a piece of red pepper, and a sprig of 
parsley. Spread a few cubes of bacon 
and vegetables on the top. Put on the 
cover, and set into the oven. Let cook 
very slowly about three hours. Press 
the liquid through a sieve, and thicken 
with flour and butter cooked together. 
Pour the sauce over the tongue. Set 
on a plate. Garnish the dish with po- 
tato and carrot balls, cooked separately. 

Braised Calf's Liver 

Wash and wipe a calf's liver. Lard, 
if desired, upon one side. Try out the 
fat from two or three slices of bacon, 
and in it brown the liver first on one 
side and then on the other. Put the 
liver into a casserole with vegetables as 
above, using, however, small onions, 
parboiled and drained, in the place of 
the sliced onions. Add a pint of brown 
stock or sauce. Cover, and let cook 
about two hours. Serve from the cas- 
serole. 

Prune Cocktail 

Cook choice prunes in the usual 
manner. Cut neatly in halves, and

N.Y.: "Recipes for vermicelli with tomatoes 
and coffee mousse." 

Vermicelli with Tomatoes 

Cook half a cup of vermicelli in boil- 
ing salted water until tender. Drain 
and rinse in cold water. Let half a can 
of tomatoes, a scant half-teaspoonful of 
salt, half a green pepper, cut in fine 
shreds, and a grating of onion or a clove 
of garlic, crushed a little, simmer over 
the fire about half an hour. Remove 
the garlic. Add the vermicelli, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, and, if de- 
sired, one-fourth a cup of grated cheese. 
Serve as soon as the cheese is melted. 
Vermicelli is added, after cooking, to 
soups, and it is also used for sweet 
puddings. 

Coffee Mousse 

Add half a cup of clear, black coffee 
and two-thirds a cup of powdered sugar 
to a pint of double cream. Then beat 
the mixture until it is solid to the bot- 
tom of the bowl. Turn into a mould 
lined with paper, filling the mould to 
overflow. Spread a paper over the top 
of the cream, fit the cover in place, and 
pack in equal measures of crushed ice 
and salt. Let stand between two and 
three hours. Serve in slices, or in slen- 
der glasses with a spoonful of whipped 
cream on the top.

Editor Browne 

Of the Rockford Morning Star 

"About seven years ago I ceased 
drinking coffee, to give your Postum 
a trial. 

"I had suffered acutely from various 



forms of indigestion, and my stomach 
had become so disordered as to repel 
almost every sort of substantial food. 
My general health was bad. At close 
intervals I would suffer severe at- 
tacks, which confined me in bed for a 
week or more. Soon after changing 
from coffee to Postum the indigestion 
abated, and in a short time ceased en- 
tirely. I have continued the daily use 
of your excellent Food Coffee, and as- 
sure you most cordially that I am in- 
debted to you for the relief it has 
brought me. 

"Wishing you a continued success, 
I am, Yours very truly, 

"J. Stanley Browne, 
"Managing Editor." 

Of course, when a man's health shows 
he can stand coffee without trouble, let 
him drink it, but most highly organized 
brain workers simply cannot. 

The drugs natural to the coffee berry 
affect the stomach and other organs, and 
thence to the complex nervous system, 
throwing it out of balance and pro- 
ducing disorders in various parts of the 
. body. Keep up .this daily poisoning, 
and serious disease is sure to supervene. 
So, when man or woman finds that coffee 
is a smooth, but deadly enemy, and 
health is of any value at all, there is but 
one road, — quit. 

It is easy to find out if coffee be the 
cause of the troubles, for, if left off ten 
days and Postum be used in its place 
and the sick and diseased conditions 
begin to disappear, the proof is un- 
answerable. 

Postum is not good if made by short 
boiling. It must be boiled full fifteen 
minutes, when the crisp coffee flavor 
and the food elements are brought out 
of the grains, and the beverage is ready 
to fulfil its mission of palatable com- 
fort and renewing the cells and nerve 
centres broken down by coffee. 

There's a reason.

Wellville," in each package.

Sweet Pickled Red Cherries 
Select tart cherries, stone the fruit, 
and weigh it. For seven pounds of 
fruit take five pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar, one cup of water, two-thirds 
a cup of stick cinnamon, one-third a 
cup of whole cloves, and a bay leaf. 
Make a syrup of the sugar, water, vine- 
gar, and cherry juice. Skim thor- 
oughly, and add the cherries and spices. 
Let simmer until the cherries are tender. 
Skim the cherries into jars, and cook 
the syrup until well reduced. Then 
use to fill the jars. If the cherries are 
very juicy (i.e., more than a cup for 
the quantity given in the recipe) omit 
the water.

Honest Confession 
A Doctor's Talk on Food 

There are no fairer set of men on earth 
than the doctors, and, when they find 
they have been in error, they are usually 
apt to make honest and manly con- 
fession of the fact. 

A case in point is that of an eminent 
practitioner, one of the good old school 
who lives in Texas. His plain, un- 
varnished tale needs no dressing up : — 

"I had always had an intense preju- 
dice, which I can now see was un- 
warrantable and unreasonable, against 
all muchly advertised foods. Hence I 
never read a line of the many ads. of 
Grape-nuts, nor tested the food till last 
winter. 

"While in Corpus Christi for my 
health, and visiting my youngest son, 
who has four of the ruddiest, healthiest 
little boys I ever saw, I ate my first 
dish of Grape-nuts food for supper with 
my little grandsons. I became exceed- 
ingly fond of it, and have eaten a pack- 
age of it every week since, and find it a 
delicious, refreshing, and strengthening 
food, leaving no ill effects whatever, 
causing no eructations (with which I 
was formerly much troubled), no sense 
of fulness, nausea, nor distress of stom- 
ach in any way. 

"There is no other food that agrees 
with me so well or sits as lightly or 
pleasantly upon my stomach as this 
does. I am stronger and more active 
since I began the use of Grape-nuts 
than I have been for ten years, and am 
no longer troubled with nausea and in- 
digestion." Name given by Postum 
Company, Battle Creek, Mich.

and seeds. Chop fine one onion and 
the pepper trimmings, discarding the 
stems. Let these cook with a table- 
spoonful of curry powder in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter until well softened, 
but not browned. Add two cups of 
boiled rice, sixteen shrimps, peeled and 
broken into small pieces, and about

nedy. Illustrated. Cloth. i2tno. 
$1.50. New York: The Macmillan 
Company. 

The modern novel is realistic. It is 
human, and consequently natural. Su- 
perstition is a constantly waning in- 
influence. The age is practical. As- 
tounding fiction no longer fascinates us. 
It is weariness to the flesh. The real 
things of earth are strange enough. 
The course of human life is sufficiently 
mysterious to satisfy the curious crav- 
ings of all. 

The story before us is interesting 
reading. The picture it gives of New 
England life is characteristic and reason- 
able. One might meet all the charac- 
ters presented, on a summer vacation in 
a Connecticut village. In them the 
reader becomes interested at once, and 
follows the course of the narrative 
with pleasure to the end. The story 
is strictly clean and wholesome, emi- 
nently fitted to please and amuse. It 
will afford hours of restful pleasure on 
a summer's day to many a reader. 

One thing can be said of the good 
novel. By it we gain wider knowledge 
of men and women. The writer studies 
and portrays for us the spirit and 
motives that actuate us all in life. 



The April issue of The Printing Art, 
published by the University Press, 
Cambridge, is a fine number. This 
periodical, now in its fifth volume, is 
far in the lead of anything of the kind. 
It is recognized as the highest exponent 
of the art of printing. By those who 
are in any wise interested in the trade 
this magazine must be esteemed as the 
source of a liberal education. 



Thb Foundation of All Reform. By 
Otto Carque\ Paper, 25 cents; cloth 
SO cents. Chicago: Kosmos Pub- 
lishing Company. 

This is a popular yet scientific treat- 
ise on the diet question. We may not 
agree fully with the conclusions of the 
author, but we cannot fail to be im- 
pressed by the facts set before us and 
the pressing need of more extended 
knowledge of the laws of nature and 
health. The essay will be of especial 
interest to the vegetarian, the fruitarian, 
and others who are seeking for radical 
reform in diet. 

"The great need of the present time 
is a better standard of health and 
morals. Legislative measures may ac- 
complish much in bettering our con- 
ditions, but the only true and lasting 
reform is that which is wrought within

Lowney's Cocoa is not like other cocoas, it is better. The flavor is better — 
full and delicious. It is absolutely a natural product; no "treatment" with alka- 
lies or other chemicals in order to cheapen the process of making. No adulteration 
with flour, starch or ground cocoa shells or coloring matter — nothing but the nutri- 
tive and digestible product of the choicest Cocoa Beans. A trial will show what it is.

physiology, and hygiene, should form 
an important part of every common 
school education, as we can hardly 
expect that people who know little

Don't Eat unless Hungry 

It is not wise to eat unless one is 
really hungry. No food should be taken 
unless there is real, natural hunger. It 
is far better to miss a meal than to eat 
without an appetite. 

A prolific cause of chronic indigestion 
is eating from habit, and simply be- 
cause it is meal time and others are 
eating. To eat when not hungry is to 
eat without relish, and food taken with- 
out relish is worse than wasted. With- 
out relish the salivary glands do not act, 
the gastric fluids are not freely se- 
creted, and the best of foods will not 
be digested. Many perfectly harmless 
dishes are severely condemned for no 
other reason than they were eaten per- 
functorily and without relish and due 
insalivation. 

Hunger makes the plainest food en- 
joyable. It causes vigorous secretion 
and outpouring of all the digestive 
fluids, — the sources of ptyalin, pepsin, 
trypsin, etc., without a plentiful supply 
of which no foods can be perfectly di- 
gested. 

Wait for an appetite if it takes a week. 
Pasting is one of the saving graces. It 
has a spiritual significance only through 
its great physical and physiologic im- 
portance. If breakfast is a bore or 
lunch a matter of indifference, cut one 
or both of them out. Wait for distinct 
and unmistakable hunger, and then eat 
slowly. If you do this, you need ask 
few questions as to the propriety and 
digestibility of what you eat, and it 
need not be predigested !

A Hopeless Case 

"Now, doctor," said she after he had 
made a careful examination, "I want 
you to tell me the truth. Don't — 
please don't— keep anything back." 

He shook his head, and replied : — 

"Do you fully realize what you are 
asking me to do? Think again." 

"Yes, yes," she insisted. "I want 
to know the truth. Don't keep any- 
thing from me. Tell me the worst." 

"It is very bad. I'm afraid you will 
never forgive me after I have spoken 
out." 

"No, no, no! Don't think that! I 
understand how you feel. Come, I 
must know. You must not keep me in 
suspense, doctor. You are cruel." 

"Well, if you insist upon knowing 
the worst, it is my opinion that a regu- 
lar course of dish-washing, bed-making, 
and sweeping, is the only thing that 
will save you from weighing one hundred 
and sixty pounds inside of five years." 

Realizing that her worst fears had 
been as naught compared with the ter- 
rible truth, the unfortunate woman fell 
back among her pillows, and gave up all 
hope. — Chicago Record-Herald. 

At a meeting of the Incorporated 
Society of Medical Officers of Health 
on November 1 1, "Hygiene in its Several 
Bearings" was the subject discussed. 
In the course of the discussion Dr. News- 
holme said that the kind of teaching 
which had been given was indicated by 
some of the answers given in certain 
examinations. One student, asked what 
should be done in a case of carbolic acid 
poisoning, replied, "An emetic should 
be given, then artificial respiration 
ought to be performed." Another, in 
reply to a question as to a dog bite, 
stated, "If any person is handy and 
foolish enough to suck the bite, let it 
be done." "Burn it out with a cos- 
metic," was the answer of a third. 
"The best way to avoid impure water 
in cisterns is having it direct from the 
main sewer in the road." "Nitro-

genous foods help to build up the waist 
of the body." "Coffee is adulterated 
by adding brickdust and sometimes by 
ground cayenne pepper, but chiefly by 
additional chickory." "In boiling meat, 
let the meat simper until finished." 
"Icebergs are not a desirable source of 
water supply, as they may not be made 
of pure water." "Cesspools are among 
the chief sources of water supply," and 
"Some water supplies come from ar- 
tisan wells." These were genuine an- 
swers given by students. Another 
speaker stated that he knew of a case 
where a student defined tuberculosis 
as a disease '.'occurring in an emanci- 
pated cow." 

The possibilities of utilizing a by- 
product were never more plainly 
shown than by the growing popularity 
of buttermilk drinking. This fluid 
was once thrown to the pigs in disgust. 
Now cool buttermilk is called for by 
all sorts of people during the summer 
months at the most fashionable 
places. 

The tomato has now secured a place 
among those foods that directly con- 
tribute to the health. Once tomatoes 
were looked on with suspicion, pre- 
sumed to cause cancer and other 
horrid ailments. This prejudice passed, 
and now a noted physician has ex- 
perimented with the juice as a mede- 
cine and says as a health preservative 
it is unequalled. 



There is satisfaction in knowing 
something that is worth knowing and 
doing something that is worth doing.

The fact that nearly a hundred thou- 
sand visitors to Niagara Falls passed 
through the "home of shredded wheat" 
last year, and witnessed the process of 
cooking, curing, and shredding wheat, 
is significant of the popular interest in 
this unique industry. Two questions 
naturally suggest themselves to the 
visitor to this plant: How do they 
"shred" wheat, and why do they 
"shred" it? 

Those who have not gone through the 
wonderful plant at Niagara Falls and 
who have not actually witnessed the 
process of shredding wheat can form 
but an imperfect idea of this remark- 
able industry. Some idea of the clean- 
liness and wholesomeness of the product 
may be gained from the fact that the 
wheat passes through twenty-two clean- 
ing and dusting machines before it 
is steam-cooked ready for shredding. 
Each of these machines has a particu- 
lar work to do. One of them, called a 
"stoner," removes all the little stones 
that get mixed up with the wheat. It is 
a most ingenious mechanism, and utilizes

the principle of gravity in separating 
the stones from the wheat. Another 
takes out the "wild oat," another re- 
moves the wild mustard seed, another 
takes out the cockle, others collect the 
dust, straw, chess, and other foreign 
substances. 

After cooking, the wheat is spread 
upon clean white cloths to dry for six- 
teen hours, and then run through shred- 
ding machines which draw it out into 
fine porous shreds. These shreds are 
formed into biscuits, and baked. 

And why do they cook and "shred" 
the wheat? Of course there's a reason 
for it. The wheat is cooked so as to 
make the starch of which the white 
flour is largely composed soluble and 
easy to digest. The "shreds" also 
contain all the rich nutriment in the 
outer coats of the wheat kernel, which 
are not found in white flour. These 
"shreds" are not only light and porous, 
readily absorbing the saliva and gastric 
juices of the stomach, but present a 
vast surface to the action of the di- 
gestive fluids.

PREFACE 



**BUT for life the universe were nothing; and all 
that has life requires nourishment" 

With the progress of knowledge the needs of the 
human body have not been fbrgotten. During the last 
decade much time has been given by scientists to the 
study of foods and their dietetic value, and it is a 
subject which rightfully should demand much con- 
sideration from alL I certainly feel that the time is 
not far distant when a knowledge of the principles of 
diet will be an essential part of one's education. Then 
mankind will eat to live, will be able to do better 
mental and physical work, and disease will be less 
frequent. 

At the earnest solicitation of educators, pupils, and 
friends, I have been urged to prepare this book, and I 
trust it may be a help to many who need its aid. It 
is my wish that it may not only be looked upon as a 
compilation of tried and tested recipes, but that it may 
awaken an interest through its condensed scientific 
knowledge which will lead to deeper thought and 
broader study of what to eat

THE BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL 
COOK BOOK 



CHAPTER I 
POOD 

FOOD is anything which nourishes the body. From fifteen 
to twenty elements enter into the composition of the 
body, of which the following thirteen are considered : oxy- 
gen, 62>^% ; carbon, 21}4%; hydrogen, 10%; nitrogen, 
3% ; calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, chlorine, so- 
dium, magnesium, iron, and fluorine the remaining 3%. 

Food is necessary for growth, repair, and energy ; there- 
fore the elements composing the body must be found in the 
food. The thirteen elements named are formed into chem- 
ical compounds by the vegetable and animal kingdoms to 
support the highest order of being, man. All food must 
undergo chemical change after being taken into the body, 
before it can be utilized by the body ; this is the office of the 
digestive system. 

Food is classified as follows : — 

(1. Proteid (nitrogenous or albuminous) 
2. Carbohydrates (sugar and starch) 
3. Fats and oils 
Mineral matter 
Water 



II. Inorganic 



The chief oflSce of proteids is to build and repair tissues. 
They furnish energy, but at greater cost than carbohydrates, 
fats, and oils. They contain nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, hy- 
drogeii) and sulphur or phosphorus, and include all forms of 



2 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

animal foods (excepting fats and glycogen) and some vegeta- 
ble foods. Examples : milk, cheese, eggs, meat, fish, cere- 
als, peas, beans, and lentils. The principal constituent of 
proteid food is albamen. Albumen as found in food takes 
dilTerent names, but has the same chemical composition ; as, 
<dbume7i in eggs, fibrin in meat, casein in milk and cheese, 
vegetable casein or legumen in peas, beans, and lentils ; and 
gluten in wheat. To this same class belongs gelatin. 

The chief office of the carbohydrates is to furnish energy 
and maintain heat. They contain carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, and include foods containing starch and sugar. 
Examples : vegetables, fruits, cereals, sugars, and gums. 

The chief office of fats and oils is to store energy and heat 
to be used as needed, and constitute the adipose tissues of 
the body. Examples: butter, cream, fat of meat, fish, 
cereals, nuts, and the berry of the olive-tree. 

The chief office of mineral matter is to furnish the neces- 
sary salts which are found in all animal and vegetable foods. 
Examples : sodium chloride (common salt) ; carbonates, sul- 
phates and phosphates of sodium, potassium, and magne- 
sium ; besides calcium phosphates and iron. 

Water constitutes about two-thirds the weight of the body, 
and is in all tissues and fluids ; therefore its abundant use is 
necessary. One of the greatest errors in diet is ne<]^lect to 
take enough water ; while it is found in all animal and vege- 
table food, the amount is insufficient. 

CORRECT PROPORTIONS OF FOOD 

Age, sex, occupation, climate, and season must determine 
the diet of a person in normal condition. 

Liquid food (milk or milk in preparation with the various 
prepared foods on the market) should constitute the diet of 
a child for the first eighteen months. After the teeth appear, 
by which time ferments have been developed for the diges- 
tion of starchy foods, entire wheat bread, baked potatoes, 
cereals, meat broths, and occasionally boiled eggs may be 
given. If mothers would use Dr. Johnson's Educators in 
place of the various sweet crackers, children would be as 



OOBRECT PROPORllONS OF FOOD 8 

weU pleased and better nourished; with a glass of milk 
they form a supper suited to the needs of little ones, and ex- 
perience has shown that children seldom tire of them. The 
diet should be gradually increased by the addition of cooked 
fruits, Yegetables, and simple desserts; the third or fourth 
year fish and meat may be introduced, if given sparingly. 
Always avoid salted meats, coarse vegetables (beets, carrots, 
and turnips), cheese, fried food, pastry, rich desserts, con- 
fections, condiments, tea, coffee, and iced water. For school 
children the diet should be varied and abundant, constantly 
bearing in mind that this is a period of great mental and 
physical growth. Where children have broken down, sup- 
posedly from over- work, the cause has often been traced to 
impoverished diet It must not be forgotten that diges- 
tive proeesses go on so rapidly that the stomach is soon 
emptied. Thanks to the iustitutor of the sehool luncheon- 
counter I 

The daily average ration of ao adult requires 

4>^ oz. proteid 18 oz. starch 

2 oz. fat 5 pints water 

About one-third of the water is taken in our food, the 
remainder as a beverage. To keep in health and do the 
best mental and physical work, authorities agree that a 
mixed diet is suited for temperate climates, although sound 
arguments appear from the vegetarian. Women, even though 
they do the same amount of work as men, as a rule require 
less food. Brain workers should take their proteid in a form 
easily digested. In consideration of this fact, fish and eggs 
form desirable substitutes for meat The working man needs 
quantity as well as quality, that the stomach may have some- 
thing to act upon. Corned beef, cabbage, brown-bread, 
and pastry, will not overtax his digestion. In old age the 
digestive organs lessen in activity, and the diet should be 
almost as simple as that of a child, increasing the amount 
of carbohydrates and decreasing the amount of proteids 
and fat. Many diseases which occur after middle life are 
due to eating and drinking such foods as were indulged in 
during vigorous manhood. 



BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 



WATEE (H,0) 

Water is a transparent, odorless, tasteless liquid. It is 
derived from five sources, — rains, rivers, surface-water or 
shallow wells, deep wells, and springs. Water is never 
found pure in nature ; it is nearly pure when gathered in 
an open field, after a heavy rainfall, or from springs. For 
town and city supply, surface-water is furnished by some 
adjacent pond or lake. Samples of such water are carefully 
and frequently analyzed, to make sure that it is not polluted 
with disease germs. 

The hardness of water depends upon the amount of salts 
of lime and magnesia which it contains. Soft water is free 
from objectionable salts, and is preferable for household 
purposes.. Hard water may be softened by boiling, or by 
the addition of a small amount of bicarbonate of soda 
(NaHCO,). 

Water freezes at a temperature of 32° F., boils at 
212° F. ; when bubbles appear on the surface and burst, 
the boiling-point is reached. In high altitudes water boils 
at a lower temperature. From 32° to 65° F. water is termed 
cold; from 65° to 92° F., tepid; 92° to 100° F., warm; over 
that temperature, hot. Boiled water is freed from all organic 
impurities, and salts of lime are precipitated; it does not 
ferment, and is a valuable antiseptic. Hot water is more 
stimulating than cold, and is of use taken on an empty 
stomach, while at a temperature of from 60'' to 95** F. it; 
is used as an emetic; 90° F. being the most favorable; 
temperature. 

Distilled water is chemically pure and is always used for 
medicinal purposes. It is flat and insipid to the taste, hav- 
ing been deprived of its atmospheric gases. 

There are many charged, carborated, and mineral spring- 
waters bottled and put on the market ; many of these are 
used as agreeable table beverages. Examples : Soda Water, 
Apollinaris, Poland, Seltzer, and Vichy. Some contain min- 
erals of medicinal value. Examples : Lithia, saline, and 
sulphur waters. 



STARCH 



SALTS 



Of all salts found in the body,' the most abundant and 
valuable is sodium chloride (NaCl), common salt; it exists 
in all tissues, secretions, and fluids of the body, with the ex- 
ception of enamel of the teeth. The amount found in food 
is not always sufl3cient ; therefore salt is used as a condiment 
It assists digestion, inasmuch as it furnishes chlorine for 
hydrochloric acid found in gastric juice. 

Common salt is obtained from evaporation of spring and 
sea water, also from mines. Our supply of salt obtained 
by evaporation comes chiefly from Michigan and New York ; 
mined salt from Louisiana and Kansas. 

Salt is a great preservative ; advantage is taken of this in 
salting meat and fish. 

Other salts — lime, phosphorus, magnesia, potash, sul- 
phur, and iron — are obtained in suflScient quantity from 
food we eat and water we drink. In young children, perfect 
formation of bones and teeth depends upon phosphorus and 
lime taken into the system ; these are found in meat and fish, 
but abound in cereals. 

STAECH (CeHioOe) 

Starch is a white, glistening powder; it, is largely distrib- 
uted throughout the vegetable kingdom, being found most 
abundantly in cereals and potatoes. Being a force-producer 
and heat-giver it forms one of the most important foods. 
Alone it cannot sustain life, but must be taken in combina- 
tion with foods which build and repair tissues. 

Test for Starch. A weak solution of iodine added to cold 
cooked starch gives an intense blue color. 

Starch is insoluble in cold water, and soluble to but a 
small extent in boiling water. Cold water separates starch- 
grains, boiling water causes them to swell and burst, thus 
forming a paste. 

Starch subjected to dry heat is changed to dextrine 
(CeHioOfi), British gum. Dextrine subjected to heat plus an 



O BOSTON COOKIMG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

acid or a ferment is changed to dextrose (CgHuOe). Dextrose 
occurs in ripe fruit, honey, sweet wine, and as a manufactured 
product. When grain is allowed to germinate for malting 
purposes, starch is changed to dextrine and dextrose. In 
fermentation, dextrose is changed to alcohol (C^HsHO) and 
carbon dioxide (CO,). Examples : bread making, vinegar, 
and distilled liquors. 

Glycogen, animal starch, is found in many animal tis- 
sues and in some fungi. Examples: in liver of meat and 
oysters. 

Raw starch is not digestible ; consequently all foods con- 
taining starch should be subjected to boiling water or dry 
heat, and thoroughly cooked. Starch is manufactured from 
wheat, corn, and potatoes. Cornstarch is manufactured 
from Indian corn. Arrowroot, the purest form of starch, is 
obtained from two or three species of the Maranta plant, 
which grows in the West Indies and other tropical countries. 
Bermuda arrowroot is most highly esteemed. Tapioca is 
starch obtained from tuberous roots of the bitter cassava, 
native of South America. Sa£;o is starch obtained from sago 
palms, native of India. 

STTGAE (CijHmOu) 

Sugar is a crystalline substance, differing from starch by 
its sweet taste and solubility in cold water. As food, its 
uses are the same as starch ; all starch must be converted 
into sugar before it can be assimilated. 

The principal kinds of sugar are : cane sugar or sucrose, 
grape sugar or glucose (CeHiaOe)? milk sugar or lactose 
(CiaHgjOii), and fruit sugar or levulose (CelliaOe). 

Cane sugar is obtained from sugar cane, beets, and the 
palm and sugar-maple trees. Sugar cane is a grass sup- 
posed to be native to Southern Asia, but now grown 
throughout the tropics, a large amount coming from Cuba 
and Louisiana; it is the commonest of all, and in all 
cases the manufacture is essentially the same. The prod- 
ucts of manufacture are: molasses, syrup, brown sugar, 
loaf, cut, granulated, powdered, and confectioners' sugar. 
Brown sugar is cheapest, but is not so pure or sweet as white 



GUM, PEOTOSE, AND CELLULOSE 7 

grades ; powdered and confectioners' sugars are fine grades, 
pulverized, and, althoagh seeming less sweet to the taste, 
are equally pure. Confectioners' sugar when applied to the 
tongue will dissolve at once ; powdered sugar is a little 
granular. 

Cane sugar when added to fruits, and allowed to cook for 
some time, changes to grape sugar, losing one- third of its 
sweetness ; therefore the reason for adding it when fruit is 
nearly cooked. Cane sugar is of great preservative value, 
hence its use in preserving fruits and milk; also, for the 
preparation of syrups. 

Three changes take place in the cooking of sugar : first, 
barley sugar ; second, caramel ; thii-d, carbon. 

Orape sugar is found in honey and all sweet fruits. It 
appears on the outside of dried fruits, such as raisins, dates, 
etc., and is only two-thirds as sweet as cane sugar. As a 
manufactured product it is obtained from the starch of corn. 

Bflilk sugar is obtained from the milk of mammalia, but 
unlike cane sugar does not ferment. 

Fruit sugar is obtained from sweet fruits, and is sold as 
diabetin, is sweeter than cane sugar, and is principally used 
by diabetic patients. 

OUH, PECTOSE, AND CELLVLOSE 

These compounds found in food are closely allied to the 
carbohydrates, but are neither starchy, saccharine, nor oily. 
Gum exists in the juices of almost all plants, coming from 
the stems, branches, and fruits. Examples: gum arable, 
gum tragacanth, and mucilage. Pectose exists in the fleshy 
pulp of unripe fruit; daring the process of ripening it 
changes to pectin ; by cooking, pectin is changed to pectosic 
acid, and by longer cooking to pectic acid. Pectosic acid is 
jelly-like when cold; pectic acid is jelly-like when hot or 
cold. Cellulose constitutes the cell-walls of vegetable life ; 
in very young vegetables it is possible that it can be acted 
upon by the digestive ferments ; in older vegetables it be- 
comes woody and completely indigestible. 



BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 



FATS AND OILB 

Fats and oils are found in both the animal and vegetable 
kingdom. Fats are solid ; oils are liquid ; they may be eon- 
verted into a liquid state by application of heat ; they contain 
three substances, — stearin (solid), olein (liquid), palmitin 
(semi-solid). Suet is an example where stearin is found in 
excess ; lard, where olien is in excess ; and butter, where pal- 
mitin is in excess. Margariu is a mixture of stearin and 
palmitin. The fatty acids are formed of stearin, olein, 
and palmitin, with glycerine as the base. Examples : stearic, 
palmitic, and oleic acid. Butyric acid is acid found in but- 
ter. These are not sour to the taste, but arc called acids on 
account of their chemical composition. 

Among animal fats cream and butter are of first impor- 
tance as foods, on account of their easy assimilation. Other 
examples are : tlie fat of meats, bone- marrow, suet (the 
best found around the loin and kidneys of the beef creature), 
lard, cottolene, coto-suet, cocoanut butter, butterine, and 
oleomargarine. The principal animal oils are cod-liver oil 
and oil found in the yolk of egg ; principal vegetable oils 
are olive, cottonseed, poppy, and cocoanut oils, and oils 
obtained from various nuts. 

Oils are divided into two classes, essential VLX\d fixed. Es- 
sential oils are volatile and soluble in alcohol. Examples : 
clove, rose, nutmeg, and violet. Fixed oils are non-volatile 
and soluble in ether, oil, or turpentine. Examples : oil of 
nuts, corn mcaU and mustard. 

Fats may be heated to a high temperature, as considered 
in cookery they have no boiling-point. When appearing to 
boil, it is evident water has been added, and the temperature 
lowered to that of boiling water, 212° F.

Boston Chemist, 

The value of milk as a food is obvious from the fact that 
it constitutes the natural food of all young mammalia during 
the period of their most rapid growth. There is some danger, 
however, of overestimating its value in the dietary of adults, 
as solid food is essential, and liquid taken should act as a 
stimulant and a solvent rather than as a nutrient. One ob- 
tains the greatest benefit from milk when taken alone at reg- 
ular intervals between meals, or before retiring, and sipped, 
rather than drunk. Hot milk is often given to produce 
sleep. 

When milk is allowed to stand for a few hours, the globules 
of fat, which have been held in suspension throughout the 
liquid, rise to the top in the form of cream; tliis is due to 
their lower specific gravity. 

The difference in quality of milk depends chiefly on the 
quantity of fat therein : casein, lactose, and mineral matter 
being nearly constant, water varying but little unless milk 
is adulterated. 

Why Milk Bours. A germ found floating in the air at- 
tacks a portion of the lactose in the milk, converting it into 
lactic acid; this, in turn, acts upon the casein (proteid) and 
precipitates it, producing what is known as curd and wTiey. 
Whey contains water, salts, and some sugar. 

Milk is preserved by sterilization, pasteurization, and evap- 
oration. Fresh condensed milk, a form of evaporized milk, 
is sold in bulk, and is preferred by many to serve with coffee. 
Various brands of condensed milk and cream are on the mar- 
ket in tin cans, hermetically sealed. Examples: Nestle's 
Swiss Condensed Milk, Eagle Condensed Milk, Daisy Con- 
densed Milk, Highland Evaporated Cream, Borden's Peerless 
Evaporated Cream. Malted milk — evaporized milk in com- 



10 BOSTON COOKING 80HOOL COOK BOOK 

bination with extracts of malted barley and wheat — is used 
to a considerable extent ; it is sold in the form of powder. 

Thin, or strawberry, and thick cream may be obtained 
from almost all creameries. Devonshire, or clotted cream, 
is cream which has been removed from milk allowed to heat 
slowly to a temperature of about 1 50° F. 

In feeding infants with milk, sterilization or pasteurization 
is sometimes recommended to avoid danger of infectious 
germs. By this process milk can be kept for many days, 
and transported if necessary. To prevent acidity of the 
stomach, add from one to two teaspoonfuls of lime water to 
each half-pint of milk. Lime water may be bought at any 
druggist's, or easily prepared at home. 

Idme "Water. Pour two quarts boiling water over an inch 
cube unslacked lime; stir thoroughly and stand over night; 
in the morning pour off the liquid that is clear, and bottle for 
use. Keep in a cool place.

Butter of commerce is made from cream of cow's milk. 
The quality depends upon the breed of cow, manner of, and 
care in, feeding. Milk from Jersey and Guernsey cows yields 
the largest amount of butter. 

Butter should be kept in a cool place and well covered, 
otherwise it is liable to become rancid; this is due to the 
albuminous constituents of tiie milk, acting as a ferment, 
setting free the fatty acids. First-quality butter should 
be used; this does not include pat butter or fancy grades. 
Poor butter has not been as thoroughly worked during man- 
ufacture, consequently more casein remains ; therefore it is 
more apt to become rancid. Fresh butter spoils quickly; 
salt acts as a preservative. Butter which has become rancid 
by too long keeping may be greatly improved by melting, 



OHEESB 11 

heating, and quickly chilling with ice-water. The hutter will 
rise to the top, and may be easily removed. 

Where butter cannot be aflPorded, there are several products 
on the market which have the same chemical composition as 
butter, and are equally wholesome. Examples: butterine 
and oleomargarine. 

Buttermilk is liquid remaining after butter '^ has come." 
When taken fresh, it makes a wholesome beverage. 

CHEESB

Cheese is the solid part of sweet milk obtained by heating 
milk and coagulating it by means of rennet or an acid. Ren- 
net is an infusion made from prepared inner membrane of 
the fourth stomach of the calf. The curd is salted and sub- 
jected to pressure. Cheese is made from skim milk, milk plus 
cream, or cream. Cheese is kept for a longer or shorter 
time, according to the kind, that fermentation or decompo- 
sition may take place. This is called ripening. Some cream 
cheeses are not allowed to ripen. Milk from Jersey and 
Guernsey cows yields the largest amount of cheese. 

Cheese is very valuable food; being rich in proteid, it 
may be used as a substitute for meat. A pound of cheese 
is equal in proteid to two pounds of beef. Cheese in the raw 
state is difficult of digestion. This is somewhat overcome 
by cooking and adding a small amount of bicarbonate of 
soda. A small piece of rich cheese is often eaten to assist 
digestion. 

The various brands of cheese take their names from the 
places where made. Many foreign ones are now well imi- 
tated in this country. The favorite kinds of skim-milk 
cheese are: Edam, Gruy^re, and Parmesan. Parmesan is 
very hard and used principally for grating. The holes in 
Gruy^re are due to aeration. 

The favorite kinds of milk cheese are : Gloucester, Che-

shire, Cheddar, and Gorgonzola ; Milk and Cream cheese : 
Stilton and Double Gloucester; Cream cheese: Brie, Neuf- 
chatel, a^d Camembert. 

FBUITS 

The varieties of fruits consumed are numerous, and their 
uses important. They are chiefly valuable for their sugar, 
acids, and salts, and are cooling, refreshing, and stimulating. 
They act as a tonic, and assist in purifying the blood. Many 
contain a jelly-like substance, called pectin, and several con- 
tain starch, which during the ripening process is converted 
into glucose. Bananas, dates, figs, prunes, and grapes, 
owing to their large amount of sugar, are the most nutritious. 
Melons, oranges, lemons, and grapes contain the largest 
amount of water. Apples, lemons, and oranges are valuable 
for their potash salts, and oranges and lemons especially 
valuable for their citric acid. It is of importance to those 
who are obliged to exclude much sugar from their dietary, 
to know that plums, peaches, apricots, and raspberries have 
less sugar than other fruits ; apples, sweet cherries, grapes, 
and pears contain the largest amount. Apples are obtain- 
able nearly all the year,, and on account of their variety, 
cheapness, and abundance, are termed queen of fruits. 

Thoroughly ripe fruits should be freely indulged in, and 
to many are more acceptable than desserts prepared in the 
kitchen. If possible, fruits should always appear on the 
breakfast-table. In cases where uncooked fruit cannot be 
freely eaten, many kinds may be cooked and prove valuable. 
Never eat unripe fruit, or that which is beginning to decay. 
Fruits should be wiped or rinsed before serving. 

VEGETABLE ACIDS, AND WHEBE FOUND 

The principal vegetable acids are: 

I. Acetic (HCaHjOa), found in wine and vinegar. 

II. Tartaric (H2C4H40«), found in grapes, pineapples, 
and tamarinds. 

III. Malic, much like tartaric, found in apples, pears, 
peaches, apricots, gooseberries, and currants. 



GONDIMSNTS 13 

IV. Citric (HsCeHsO?), found in lemons, oranges, limes, 
and citron. 

V. Oxalic (HaC204), found in rhubarb and sorrel. 

To these may be added tannic acid, obtained from gall 
nuts. Some fruits contain two or more acids. Malic and 
citric are found in strawberries, raspberries, goosebenies, 
and cherries ; malic, citric, and oxalic in cranberries. 

CONDIMENTS 

Condiments are not classed among foods, but are known 
as food adjuncts. They are used to stimulate the appetite 
by adding flavor to food. Among the most important ai'e 
salt, spices, and various flavorings. Salt, according to some 
authorities, is called a food, being necessary to life. 

Black pepper is ground peppercorns. Peppercorns are 
the dried berries of Pipor nigrum^ grown in the West Indies, 
Sumatra, and other eastern countines. 

"White pepper is made from the same beiTy, the outer husk 
being removed before grinding. It is less irritating than 
black pepper to the coating of the stomach. 

Cayenne pepper is the powdered pod of Capsicum grown 
on the eastern coast of Africa and in Zanzibar. 

Mustard is the ground seed of two species of the Brassica. 
Brassica cUba yields white mustard seeds ; Brassica ntgra^- 
black mustard seeds. Both species are grown in Europe and 
America. 

Ginger is the pulverized dried root of Zanzibar officindlej 
grown in Jamaica, China, and India. Commercially speak' 
ing, there are three grades, — Jamaica, best and strongest; 
Cochin, and African. 

Cinnamon is the ground inner bark of Cinnamomum zey- 
laTucumy principally grown in Ceylon. The cinnamon of 
commerce (cassia) is the powdered bark of different species 
of the same shrub, which is principally grown in China, and 
called Chinese cinnamon. It is cheaper than true cinnamon. 

ClcTe is the ground flower buds of Caryophyllus aromati- 
ctt^, native to the Moluccas or Spice Islands, but now grpwo 
prinpipally in Zaus^ibftr, P^mb?^, m(\ the W?pt Jndie^. 



14 nOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

PlmoJito (commonly called allspice) is the ground fruit of 
Eugenia inmenta grown in Jamaica and the West Indies. 

Nutmeg IB the kernel of the fruit of the MyrisHoa fror 
gransy grown in Banda Islands. 

Mace. The fibrous network which envelops the nutmeg 
seed constitutes the mace of commerce. 

Vinegar is made from apple cider, malt, and wine, and is 
the product of fermentation. It is a great perservative ; 
hence its use in the making of pickles, sauces, and other 
condiments. The amount of acetic acid in vinegar varies 
from two to seven per cent 

Capers are flower buds of Capparis spinoaa^ grown in 
countries bordering the Mediterranean. They are preserved 
in vinegar, and bottled for exportation. 

Horse-radish is the root of Cochliaria armordcta^ — a plant 
native to Europe, but now grown in our own country. It is 
generally grated, mixed with vinegar, and bottled. 

FLAVORING EXTRACTS 

Many flavoring extracts are on the market Examples: 
almond, vanilla, lemon, orange, peach, and rose. These 
are made from the flower, fruit, or seed from which they are 
named. Strawberry, pineapple, and banana extracts are 
manufactured from chemicals.

CHAPTER II 

COOKEBT 

COOKERY is the art of preparing food for the nomish- 
nient of the body. 

Prehistoric man may have lived on uncooked foods, but 
there are no savage races to-day who do not practise cookery 
in some way, however cmde. Progress in civilization has 
been accompanied by progress in cookery. 

Much time has been given in the last few years to the 
stady of foods, their necessary proportions, and manner of 
cooking them. Educators have been shown by scientists 
that this knowledge should be disseminated; as a result, 
** Cookery" is found in the curriculum of public schools of 
many of our towns and cities. 

Food is cooked to develop new flavors, to make it more 
palatable and digestible, and to destroy micro-organisms. 
For cooking there are three essentials (besides the material 
to be cooked), — heat, air, and moisture. 

Heat is molecular motion, and is produced by combustion. 
Heat used for cookery is obtained by the combustion of in- 
flammable substances — wood, coal, charcoal, coke, gas, 
gasoline, kerosene, and alcohol — called fuels. Heat for 
cookery is applied by radiation, conduction, and convection. 

Air is composed of oxygen, nitrogen, and argon,' and 
surrounds everything. Combustion cannot take place with- 
out it, the oxygen of the air being the only supporter of 
combustion. 

MoUtnre, in the form of water, either found in the food 
or added to it. 

The combined effect of heat and moisture swells and 
bursts starch-grains; hardens albumen in eggs, fish, and 
meat; softens fibrous portions of meat, and cellulose of 
vegetables. 



16 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Among fuels, kerosene oil is the cheapest ; gas gives the 
greatest amount of heat in the shortest time. Soft woody 
like pine, on account of its coarse fibre, burns quickly; 
therefore makes the best kindling. Hard wood^ like oak 
and ash, having the fibres closely packed, burns slowly, and 
is used in addition to pine wood for kindling coal. Where 
only wood is used as a fuel, it is principally hard wood. 

Charcoal for fuel is produced by the smothered combus- 
tion of wood. It gives an intense, even heat, therefore makes 
a good broiling fire. Its use for kindling is not infrequent. 

There are two kinds of coal: Anthracite^ or hard coal. 
Examples: Hard and free-burning White Ash, Shamokin, 
and Franklin. Nut is any kind of hard coal obtained from 
screenings. Bituminous^ or soft coal. Example: cannel 
coal. 

Coke is the solid product of carbonized coal, and bears 
the same relation to coal that charcoal bears to wood. 

Alcohol is employed as fuel when the chafing-dish is used. 

FIEE 

Fire for cookery is confined in a stove or range, so that 
heat may be utilized and regulated. Flame-heat is obtained 
from kerosene, gas, or alcohol, as used in oil-stoves, gas- 
stoves or gas-ranges, and chafing-dishes. 

A cooking-Btove is a large iron box set on legs. It has a 
fire-box in the front, the sides of which are lined with fire- 
proof material similar to that gf which bricks are made. 
The bottom is furnished with a movable Iron grate. Under- 
neath the fire-box is a space which extends from the grate to 
a pan for receiving ashes. At the back of fire-box is a com- 
partment called the oven, accessible on each side of the stove 
by a door. Between the oven and the top of the stove is a 
space for the circulation of air. 

Stoves are connected with chimney-flues by means of a 
stovepipe, and have dampers to regulate the supply of air 
and heat, and as an outlet for smoke and gases. 

The damper below the fire-box is known as the front 
damper, by means of which the air supply is regulated, thus 
regulating the heat 



HOW TO BUILD A FIRE 17 

The oven is heated by a circulation of hot air. This is 
accomplished by closing the oven-damper, which is situated 
near the oven. When this damper is left open, the hot air 
rushes up the chimney. The damper near the chimney is 
known as the chlmnei/-damper. When open it gives a free 
outlet for the escape of smoke and gas. When partially 
closed, as is usually the case in most ranges, except when 
the fire is started, it serves as a saver of heat. There is 
also a check, which, when open, cools the fire and saves heat, 
but should always be closed except when used for this 
purpose. 

Stoves are but seldom used, portable ranges having taken 
their places. 

A portable range is a cooking-stove with one oven door ; 
it often has an under oven, of use for warming dishes and 
keeping food hot. 

A set range is built in a fireplace. It usually has two 
ovens, one on each side of the fire-box, or two above it at 
the back. Set ranges, as they consume so large an amount 
of fuel, are being replaced by portable ones. 

HOW TO BTTILB A FIBE 

Before starting to build a fire, free the grtite from ashes. 
To do this, put on covers, close front and back dampers, 
and open oven-damper ; turn grate, and ashes will fall into 
the ash receiver. If these rules are not followed, ashes will 
fly over the room. Turn grate back into place, remove the 
covers over fire-box, and cover grate with pieces of paper 
(twisted in centre and left loose at the ends). Cover paper 
with small sticks, or pieces of pine wood, being sure that 
the wood reaches the ends of fire-box, and so arranged that 
it will admit air. Over pine wood arrange hard wood; 
then sprinkle with two shovelfuls of coal. Put on covers, 
open closed dampers, strike a match, — suflficient friction is 
formed to burn the phosphoiiis, this in turn lights the sul- 
phur, and the sulphur the wood, — then apply the lighted 
match under the grate, and you have a fire. 

Now blacken the stove. Begin at front of range, and 



18 BOSTON COOKIK0-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

work towards ihe back; as the iron heats, a good polish 
may be obtained. When the wood is thoroughly kindled, 
add more coal. A blue flame will soon appear, which is the 
gas (CO) in the coal burning to carbon dioxide (COj), when 
the blue flame changes to a white flame; then the oven- 
damper should be closed. In a few moments the front 
damper may be nearly closed, leaving space to admit suffi- 
cient oxygen to feed the Are. It is sometimes forgotten that 
oxygen is necessary to keep a fire burning. As soon as the 
coal is well ignited, half close the chimney-damper, unless 
the draft be very poor. 

Never allow the fire-box to be more than three*fonrths 
filled. When full, the draft is checked, a larger amount of 
fuel is consumed, and much heat is lost. This is a point 
that should be impressed on the mind of the cook. 

Ashes must be removed and sifted daily ; pick over and 
save good coals, — which are known as cinders, — throwing 
out useless pieces, known as clinkers. 

If a fire is used constantly during the day, replenish coal 
frequently, but in small quantities. If for any length of 
time the fire is not needed, open check, the dampers being 
closed ; when again wanted for use, close check, open front 
damper, and wjth a poker rake out ashes from under fire, 
and wait for fire to burn brightly before adding new coal. 

Coal when red hot has parted with most of its heat. 
Some refuse to believe this, and insist upon keeping dampers 
open until most of the heat has escaped into the chimney. 

To keep a fire over night, remove the ashes from under the 
fire, put on enough coal to fill the box, close the dampers, 
and lift the back covers enough to admit air. This is better 
than lifting the covers over the fire-box and prevents poison- 
ous gases entering the room. 

WATS OF cooznra 

The principal ways of cooking are boiling, broiling, 
stewing, roasting, baking, frying, sauteing, braising, and 
fricasseeing. 

Boiling is cooking in boiling water. Solid food so cooked 



WAYS OP OOOKINQ 19 

la called boiled food, though literally this expresflion is io- 
oorrect Examples : boiled eggs, potatoes, mutton, etc. 

Water boils at 212° F. (sea level), and simmers at 185^ F. 
Slowly boiling water has the same temperature as rapidly 
boiling water, consequently is able to do the same work, — 
a fact often forgotten by the cook, who is too apt " to wood " 
the fire that water may boil vigorously. 

Watery vapor and steam pass off from boiling water. 
Steam is invisible ; watery vapor is visible, and is often mis- 
called steam. Cooking utensils commonly used permit the 
escape of watery vapor and steam ; thereby much heat is lost 
if food is cooked in rapidly boiling water. 

Water is boiled for two purposes : first, cooking of itself 
to destroy organic impurities; second, for cooking foods. 
Boiling water toughens and hardens albumen in eggs; 
toughens fibrin and dissolves tissues in meat ; bursts starch- 
grains and softens cellulose in cereals and vegetables. Milk 
should never be allowed to boil. At boiling temperature 
(214° F.) the casein is slightly hardened, and the fat is ren- 
dered more difficult of digestion. Milk heated over boiling 
water, as in a double boiler, is called scalded milk, and 
reaches a temperature of 196° F. When foods are cooked 
over hot water the process is called steaming. 

Stewing is cooking in a small amount of hot water for a 
long time at low temperature ; it is the most economical way 
of cooking meats, as all nutriment is retained, and the 
ordinary way of cooking cheaper cuts. Thus fibre and con- 
nective tissues are softened, and the whole is made tender 
and palatable. 

Broiling is cooking over or in front of a clear fire. The 
food to be cooked is usually placed in a greased broiler or on 
a gridiron held near the coals, turned often at first to sear 
the outside, — thus preventing escape of inner juices, — 
afterwards turned occasionally. Tender meats and fish may 
be cooked in this way. The flavor obtained by broiling is 
particularly fine ; there is, however, a greater loss of weight 
in this than in any other way of cooking, as the food thus 
cooked is exposed to free circulation of air. When coal is 
not used, or a fire is not in condition for broiling, a plan for 



20 BOSTON COOKINGH8CHOOL COOK BOOK 

pan broiling has been adopted. This is done by placing food 
to be cooked in a hissing hot frying-pan, turning often as in 
broiling. 

RoaBtiiig is cooking before a clear fire, with a reflector to 
concentrate the heat. Heat is applied in the same way as 
for broiling, the difference being that the meat for roasting 
is placed on a spit and allowed to revolve, thicker pieces 
alway being employed. Tin-kitchens are now but seldom 
used. Meats cooked in a range oven, though really baked, 
are said to be roasted. Meats so cooked are pleasing to the 
sight and agreeable to the palate, although, according to 
Edward Atkinson, not so easily digested as when cooked at 
a lower temperature in the Aladdin oven. 

Baking is cooking in a range oven. 

Frying is cooking by means of immersion in deep fat 
raised to a temperature of 350° to 400° F. For frying pur- 
poses olive oil, lard, beef drippings, cottolene, coto suet, and 
cocoanut butter are used. A combination of two- thirds lard 
and one-third beef suet (tried out and clarified) is better than 
lard alone. Cottolene, coto suet, and cocoanut butter are 
economical, inasmuch as they may be heated to a high tem- 
perature without discoloring, therefore may be used for a 
larger number of fryings. Cod fat obtained from beef is 
often used by chefs for frying. 

Great care should be taken in frying that fat is of the 
right temperature; otherwise food so cooked will absorb 
fat. 

Nearly all foods which do not contain eggs are dipped 
in flour or crumbs, egg^ and crumbs, before frying. The in- 
tense heat of fat hardens the albumen, thus forming a coating 
which prevents food from " soaking fat." 

When meat or fish is to be fried, it should be kept in a 
warm room for some time previous to cooking, and- wiped 
as dry as possible. If cold, it decreases the temperature 
of the fat to such extent that a coating is not formed 
quickly enough to prevent fat from penetrating the food. 
The ebullition of fat is due to water found in food to be 
cooked. 

Great car? must be taken thftt too much iq not put into

the fat at one time, not only because it lowers the tem- 
perature of the fat, but because it causes it to bubble and 
go over the sides of the kettle. It is not fat that boils, but 
water which fat has received from food. 

All fried food on removal from fat should be drained on 
brown paper. 

Roles lor Testing Fat lor Frying. 1. When the fat 
begins to smoke, drop in an inch cube of bread from soft 
part of loaf, and if in forty seconds it is golden brown, the 
fat is then of right temperature for frying any cooked 
mixture. 

2. Use same test for uncooked mixtures, allowing one 
minute for bread to brown. 

Many kinds of food may be fried in the same fat ; new 
fat should be used for batter and dough mixtures, potatoes, 
and fishballs ; after these, fish, meat, and croquettes. Fat 
should be frequently clarified. 

To Clarify Fat. Melt fat, add raw potato cut in quarter- 
inch slices, and allow fat to heat gradually ; when fat ceases 
to bubble and potatoes are well browned, strain through 
double cheeseclotli, placed over wire strainer, into a pan. 
The potato absorbs any odors or gases, and collects to itself 
some of the sediment, remainder settling to bottom of 
kettle. 

When small amount of fat is to be clarified, add to cold 
fat boiling water, stir vigorously, and set aside to cool ; the 
fat will form a cake on top, which may be easily removed ; 
on bottom of the cake will be found sediment, which may be 
readily scraped off with a knife. 

Kemnants of fat, either cooked or uncooked, should be 
saved and tried out, and when necessary clarified. 

Fat from beef, poultry, chicken, and pork, may be used 
for shortening or frying purposes; fat from mutton and 
smoked meats may be used for making hard and soft soap ; 
fat removed from soup stock, the water in which corned 
beef has been cooked, and drippings from roast beef, may 
be tried out, clarified, and used for shortening or frying 
purposes. 

To Try out Fat. Cut in small pieces and melt in top of 



2i BOSTON COOKIKG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

A double boiler; in this way it will require less watching 
than if placed in kettle on the back of range. Leaf lard 
is tried out in the same way; in cutting tbe leaf, remove 
membrane. After straining lard, that which remains may 
be salted, pressed, and eaten as a relish, and is called 
scraps. 

ftattt^lng Is frying in a small quantity of fat. Food so 
cooked is much more difficult of digestion than when fried 
in deep fat ; it is impossible to cook in this way without the 
food absorbing fat A frying-pan or griddle is used; the 
food is cooked on one side, then turned, and cooked on 
the other. 

Braising is stewing and baking (meat). Meat to be 
braised is frequently first santM to prevent escape of much 
Juice in the gravy. The meat is placed in a pan with a small 
quantity of stock or water, vegetables (carrot, turnip, celery, 
and union) cut in pieces, salt, pepper, and sweet herbs. The 
pan should have a tight-fitting cover. Meat so prepai'ed 
should be cooked in an oven at low uniform temperature for 
a long time. This is an economical way of cooking, and the 
only way besides stewing or boiling of making a large piece 
of tough meat palatable and digestible. 

Frioasseeing; is saut^ing and serving with a sauce. Ten- 
der meat is fricasseed without previous cooking ; less tender 
meat requires cooking in hot water before frlcasseeing. 
Although veal is obtained from a young creature, it requires 
long cooking; it is usually sauted, and then cooked in a 
sauce at low temperature for a long time.

Bgging and Crumbing. Use for crumbing dried bread 
crumbs which have been rolled and sifted, or soft stale 
bread broken in pieces and forced through a colander. An 
ingenious machine on the market, ^^ Tiie Bread Crumber," 
does this work. Egg used for crumbing should be broken 
into a shallow plate and beaten with a silver fork to blend 
yolk and white; dilute each egg with two tablespoons 



WAYS OF PBBPARI^fO FOOD FOB. COOKING 28 

water. The crumbs should be taken on a board ; food to be 
fried should be firat rolled in crumbs (care being taken that 
all parts are covered with crumbs), then dipped in egg 
mixture (equal care being taken to cover all parts), then 
rolled in crumbs again ; after the last crumbing remove food 
to a place on the board where there are no crumbs, and 
shake off some of the outer ones which make coating too 
thick. A broad-bladed knife with short handle — the Teller 
knife — is the most convenient utensil for lifting food to be 
crumbed from egg mixture. Small scallops, oysters, and 
crabs are more easily crumbed by putting crumbs and fish 
in paper and shaking paper until the fish is covered with 
crumbs. The object of first crumbing is to dry the surface 
that egg may ding to it; and where a thin coating is desired 
flour is often used in place of crumbs. 

Larding is introducing small pieces of fat salt pork or 
bacon through the surface of uncooked meat The flavor 
of lean and dry meat is much improved by larding ; tender- 
loin of beef (fillet), grouse, partridge, pigeon, and liver are 
often prepared in this way. Pig pork being firm, is best 
for larding. Pork should be kept in a cold place that it may 
be well chilled. Remove rind and use the part of pork 
which lies between rind and vein. With sharp knife (which 
is sure to make a clean cut) remove slices a little less than 
one-fourth inch thick ; cut the slices into strips a little less 
than one-fourth inch wide ; these strips should be two and 
one-fourth inches long, and are called lardoons. Lardoons 
for small birds — quail, for example — should be cut smaller 
and not quite so long. To lard, insert one end of lardoon 
into larding- needle, hold needle firmly, and with pointed end 
take up a stitch one-third inch deep and three-fourths inch 
wide ; draw needle through, care being taken that lardoon is 
left in meat and its ends project to equal lengths. Arrange 
lardoons in parallel rows, one inch apart, stitches in the 
alternate rows being directly underneath each other. Lard 
the upper surface of cuts of meat with the grain, never 
across it. In birds, insert lardoons at right angles to breast- 
bone on either side. When large lardoons are forced 
through meat from surface to surface, the process is called 



24 BOSTON OOOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

daubing. Example: Beef 4 la mode. Thin slices of fat 
salt pork placed over meat may be substituted for larding, 
but flavor is not the same as when porl^ is drawn through 
flesh, and the dish is far less sightly. 

Boning is removing bones from meat or fish, lea^nng the 
flesh nearly in its original shape. For boning, a small 
sharp knife with pointed blade is essential. Legs of mutton 
and veal and loins of beef may be ordered boned at market, 
no extra charge being made. 

Whoever wishes to learn how to bone should first be 
taught boning of a small bird ; when this is accomplished, 
larger birds, chickens, and turkeys may easily be done, 
the processes varying but little. In large birds tendons 
are drawn from legs, and the wings are left on and boned. 

How to Bone a Bird 

In buying birds for boning, select those which have been 
fresh killed, dry picked, and not drawn. Singe, remove 
pin feathers, head, and feet, and cut off wings close to body. 
Lay bird on a board, breast down. 

Begin at neck and with sharp knife cut through the 
skin the entire length of body. Scrape the flesh from back- 
bone until end of one shoulder-blade is found ; scrape flesh 
from shoulder-blade and continue around wing-joint, cutting 
through tendinous portions which are encountered; then 
bone other side. Scrape skin from backbone the entire 
length of body, working across the ribs. Free wishbone 
and collar-bones, at same time removing crop and windpipe ; 
continue down breastbone, particular care being taken not 
to break the skin as it lies very near bone, or to cut the 
delicate membranes which enclose entrails. Scrape flesh 
from second joints and drumsticks, laying it back and 
drawing off as a glove may be drawn from the hand. 
Withdraw carcass and put flesh back in its original shape. 
In large birds where wings are boned, scrape flesh to middle 
joint, where bone should be broken, leaving bone at tip end 
to assist in preser\ang shape. 



HOW TO M£ASnBB 25 

How to Measure 

Correct measurements are absolutely necessary to insure 
the best results. Good judgment, with experience, has 
taught some to measure by sight; but the majority need 
definite guides. 

Tin, granite-ware, and glass measuring-cups, divided in 
quarters or thirds, holding one half-pint, and tea and table 
spoons of regulation sizes, — which may be bought at any 
store where kitchen furnishings are sold, — and a case knife, 
are essentials for correct measurement Mixing-spdbns, 
which are little larger than tablespoons, should not be con- 
founded with the latter. 

Measuring Ingredients. Flour, meal, powdered and con- 
fectioners' sugar, and soda should be sifted before measur- 
ing. Mustard and baking-powder, from standing in boxes, 
settle, therefore should be stirred to lighten; salt frequently 
lumps, and these lumps should be broken. A cupful is meas- 
ured level. To measure a cupful, put in the ingredient by 
spoonfuls or from a scoop, round slightly, and level with 
a case knife, care being taken not to shake the cup. A 
tablespoofiful is measured level, A teaspoonful is measured 
level. 

To measure tea or table spoonfuls, dip the spoon in the 
ingredient, fill, lift, and level with a knife, the sharp edge 
of knife being toward tip of spoon. Divide with knife 
lengthwise of spoon, for a half-spoonful; divide halves 
crosswise for quarters, and quarters crosswise for eighths. 
Less than one-eighth of a teaspoonful is considered a few 
grains. 

Measuring Liquids. A cupful of liquid is all the cup will 
hold. 

A tea or table spoonful is all the spoon will hold. 

Measuring Butter, Lard, etc. To measure butter, lard, 
and other solid fats, pack solidly into cup or spoon, and 
level with a knife. 

When dry ingredients, liquids, and fats are called for 
in the same recipe, measure in the order given, thereby 
using but one cup.

Next to measuring comes care in eombmiog, ^-^ a fact 
tiot always recognized by the inexpetienccd. Three ways 
are considered, — stirring, beating, and cutting and folding. 

To Btir, mix by using circular motion, widening the circles 
antil all is blended. Stirring is the motion ordinarily em- 
ployed in all cookery, alone or in combination with beating. 

To b«at, turn ingredient or ingredients over and over, 
continually bringing the under part to the surface, thus 
alloVing the utensil used for beating to be constantly 
brought in contact witii bottom of the dish and throughout 
the mixture. 

To oQt and fold, introduce one ingredient into another 
ingredient or mixture by two motions: with a spoon, a 
repeated vertical downward motion, known as cutting ; and 
a turning over and over of mixture, allowing bowl of spoon 
each time to come in contact with bottom of dish, is 
called folding. These repeated motions are alternated until 
thorough blending is accomplished. 

Bj Btinring^ ingredients are mixed; by beating^ a large 
amount of air is inclosed ; by cutting and folding^ air already 
introduced is prevented from escaping. 

Ways of Preserving 

1. By Freezing. Foods which spoil readily are frozen 
for transportation, and must be kept packed in ice until 
used. Examples : Fish and poultry. 

2. By Refrigeration. Foods so preserved are kept in 
cold storage. The cooling is accomplished by means of 
ice, or by a machine where compressed gas is cooled and 
then permitted to expand. Examples : meat, milk, butter, 
eggs, etc. 

3. By Canning. Which is preserving in air-tight glass 
Jars, or tin cans hermetically sealed. When fruit is canned, 
sugar is usually added. 

4. By Sugar. Examples: fruit-juices and condensed 
milk. 

5. By Exclusion of Air. Foods are preserved by ex* 



TABIiB OF MEASUaOS AKP WEIGHTS

clasion of air in other wajs than canning. Examples: 
grapeB in bran, eggs in lime water, eta 

6. By Drying. Drying consists in evaporation of nearly 
all moisture, and is generally combined with salting, except 
in vegetables and fruits. 

7. By Bvaporatlon. There are examples where con- 
siderable moisture remains, though much is driven off. 
Example : beef extract. 

8. By Salting. There are two kinds of salting, — dry, 
and corning or salting in brine. Examples: salt codfish, 
beef, pork, tripe, etc. 

9. By Smoking. Some foods, after being salted, are 
hung in a closed room for several hours, where hickory 
wood is allowed to smother. Examples: ham, beef, and 
fish. 

10. By Pickling. Vinegar, to which salt is added, and 
sometimes sugar and spices, is scalded; and cucumbers, 
onions, and various kinds of fruit are allowed to remain 
in it. 

11. By Oil. Examples : sardines, anchovies, etc. 

12. By AntiBeptics. The least wholesome way is by 
the use of antiseptics. Borax and salicylic acid, when 
employed, should be used sparingly.

CHAPTER III 

BEVEBAGES 

A BEVERAGE is any drink. Water is the beverage 
provided for man by Nature. Water is an essential 
to life. All beverages contain a large percentage of water, 
therefore their uses should be considered : — 

I. To quench thirst. 
II. To introduce water into the circulatory system. 

III. To regulate body temperature. 

IV. To assist in carrying off waste. 
V. To nourish. 

VI. To stimulate the nervous system and various organs. 
VII. For medicinal purposes 

Freshly boiled water should be used for making hot bev- 
erages ; freshly drawn water for making cold beverages. 

TEA 

Tea is used by more than one-half the human race; 
and, although the United States is not a tea-drinking 
country, one and one-half pounds are consumed per capita 
per annum. 

All tea is grown from one species of shrub, Tliea^ the 
leaves of which constitute the tea of commerce. Climate, 
elevation, soil, cultivation, and care in picking and cur- 
ing all go to make up the differences. First-quality tea 
is made from young, whole leaves. Two kinds of tea are 
considered : — ■ 

Black tea^ made from leaves which have been allowed 
to ferment before curing. 

Green tea., made from unfermented leaves artificially 
colored. 



TEA 33 

The best black tea comes from India and Ceylon. Some 
familiar brands aie Oolong, Formosa, English Breakfast, 
Orange Pekoe, and Flowery Pekoe. The last two named, 
often employed at the '* five o'clock tea," command high 
prices; they are made from the youngest leaves. Orange 
Pekoe is scented with orange leaves. The best green tea 
comes from Japan. Some familiar brands are Hyson, 
Japan, and Gunpowder. 

From analysis, it has been found that tea is rich in 
proteid, but taken as an infusion acts as a stimulant 
rather than as a nutrient. The nutriment is gained from 
sugar and milk served with it. The stimulating property of 
tea is due to the alkaloid, theine^ together with an essential 
oil; it contains an astringent, tannin. Black tea contains 
less theine, essential oil, and tannin than green tea. The 
tannic acid, developed from the tannin by infusion, Injures 
the coating of the stomach. 

Although tea is not a substitute for food, it appears so 
for a considerable period of time, as its stimulating effect 
is immediate. It is certain that less food is required where 
much tea is taken, for by its use there is less wear of the 
tissues, consequently need of repair. When taken to excess, 
it so acts on the nervous 83rstem as to produce sleeplessness 
or insomnia, and finally makes a complete wreck of its 
victim. Taken in moderation, it acts as a mild stimulant, 
and ingests a considerable amount of water into the system ; 
it heats the body in winter, and cools the body in summer. 
Children should never be allowed to drink tea, and it had 
better be avoided by the young, while it may be indulged in 
by the aged, as it proves a valuable stimulant as the func- 
tional activities of the stomach become weakened. 

Freshly boiled water should be used for making tea. 
Boiled, because below the boiling-point tiie stimulating prop- 
erty, theine, would not be extracted. Freshly boiled, because 
long cooking renders it flat and insipid to taste on account 
of escape of its atmospheric gases. Tea should always be 
infused, never boiled. Long steeping destroys the delicate 
flavor by developing a larger amount of tannic ftcid. 



34 BOSTON COOKING-9CHOOL COOK BOOK 

How to Make Tea 

8 teaspoons tea 2 caps boiliug water 

Scald an eartheni or china teapot. 

Put in tea, and pour on boiling water. Let stand on 
back of range or in a warm place five minutes. Strain 
and serve immediately, with or without sugar and milk. 
Avoid second steeping of leaves with addition of a few 
fresh ones. If this is done, so large an amount of tannin is 
extracted that various ills are apt to follow. 

Five o'clock Tea 

When tea is made in dining or drawing room, a '^ Five 
o'clock Tea-kettle'' (Samovar), and tea-ball or teapot are 
used. 

Rvuiaian Tea 

Follow recipe for making tea. Russian Tea may be 
served hot or cold, but always without milk. A thin slice 
of lemon, from which seeds have been removed, or a few 
drops of lemon-juice, is allowed for each cup. Sugar is 
added according to taste. In Russia a preserved straw- 
berry to each cup is considered an improvement. We 
imitate our Russian friends by garnishing with a candied 
cherry. 

De John's Tea 

Follow recipe for making tea and serve hot, allowing 
three whole cloves to each cup. Sugar is added according 
to taste. 

Iced Tea 
4 teaspoons tea 2 cups boiling water 

Follow recipe for making tea. Strain into glasses one- 
third full of cracked ice. Sweeten to taste, and allow one 
slice lemon to each glass tea. The flavor is much finer by 
ohilling the infusion quickly. 

Wellealey Tea 

Make same as Iced Tea, having three crushed mint leaves 
in each glass into which the hot infusion is strained.

COFFEE 

The coffee-tree is native to Abyssinia, but is now grown 
in all tropical countries. It belongs to the genus Cqfea, 
of which there are about twenty-two species. The seeds 
of berries of coffee^trees constitute the coffee of commerce. 
£ach berry contains two seeds, with e:cception of maleberry, 
which is a single round seed. In their natural state they are 
almost tasteless; therefore color, shape, and size determine 
value. Formerly, coffee was cured by exposure to the sun ; 
but on account of wann climate and sudden rainfalls, coffee 
was often injured. By the new method coffee is washed, 
and then dried by steam heat. 

In coffee plantations, trees are planted in parallel rows, 
from six to eight feet apart, and arc pruned so as never to 
exceed six feet in height. Bananft-trees are often grown in 
coffee plantations, advantage being taken of their outspread- 
ing leaves, which protect coffee-trees from direct rays of the 
sun. Brazil produces about two-thinls the coffee used. 
Central America, Java, and Arabia are also coffee centres. 

Tea comes to us ready for use; coffee needs roasting. 
In process of roasting the seeds increase in size, but lose 
fifteen per cent in weight Roasting is necessary to develop 
the delightful aroma and flavor. Java coffee is considered 
finest Mocha commands a higher price, owing to certain 
acidity and sparkle, which alone is not desirable ; but when 
combined with Java, in proportion of two parts Java to one 
part Mocha, the coffee best suited to average taste is made. 
Some people prefer Maleberry Java ; so especial care is 
taken to have maleberries separated, that they may be sold 
for higher price. Old Government Java has deservedly 
gained a good reputation, as it is carefully inspected, and its 
sale controlled by Dutch government. Strange as it may 
seem to the consumer, all coffee sold as Java does not come 
from the island of Java. Any coffee, wherever grown, hav* 
ing same characteristics and flavor, is sold as Java. The 
same is true of other kinds of coffee. 

The stimulating property of coffee is due to the alkaloid 
caffeine^ together with an essential oil. Like tea, it contains 



36 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

an astringent. Coffee is more stimalating than tea, although, 
weight for weight, tea contains about twice as much tJieine 
as coffee contains caffeine. The smaller proportion of tea 
used accounts for the difference. A cup of coffee with 
breakfast, and a cup of tea with supper, serve as a mild 
stimulant for an adult, and form a valuable food adjunct, 
but should never be found in the dietary of a child or dys- 
peptic. Coffee taken in moderation quickens action of the 
heart, acts directly upon the nervous system, and assists 
gastric digestion. Fatigue of body and mind are much les- 
sened by moderate use of coffee ; severe exposure to cold can 
be better endured by the coffee drinker. In times of war, 
coffee has proved more valuable than alcoholic stimulants to 
keep up the enduring power of soldiers. Coffee acts as an 
antidote for opium and alcoholic poisoning. Tea and coffee 
are much more readily absorbed when taken on an empty 
stomach ; therefore this should be avoided except when used 
for medicinal purposes. Coffee must be taken in modera- 
tion ; its excessive use means palpitation of the heart, tremor, 
insomnia, and nervous prostration. 

Coffee is often adulterated with chiccory, beans, peas, and 
various cereals, which are colored, roasted, and ground. 
By many, a small amount of chiccory is considered an im- 
provement, owing to the bitter principle and volatile oil 
which it contains. Chiccory is void of caffeine. The addi- 
tion of chiccory may be detected by adding cold water to 
supposed coffee; if chiccory is present, the liquid will be 
quickly discolored, and chiccory will sink; pure coffee will 
float. 

Buying of Coffee. Coffee should be bought for family use 
in small quantities, freshly roasted and ground ; or, if one 
has a coffee mill, it may be ground at home as needed. 
After being ground, unless kept air tight, it quickly deterio- 
rates. If not bought in air-tight cans, with tight-fitting 
cover, or glass jar, it should be emptied into canister as 
soon as brought from grocer's. 

Coffee may be served as filtered coffee, infusion of coffee, 
or decoction of coffee. Commonly speaking, boiled coffee is 



COFFEE 37 

preferred, and is more economical for the consamer. Coffee 
is ground fine, coarse, and medium; and the grinding de- 
pends on the way in which it is to be made. For filtered 
coffee have it finely ground ; for boiled, coarse or medium. 

Filtered Coffee 

(French or Percolated) 

1 cup coffee (finely ground) 6 cups boiling water 

Various kinds of coffee-pots are on the market for making 
filtered coffee. They all contain a strainer to hold coffee 
without allowing grounds to mix with infusion. Some have 
additional vessel to hold boiling water, upon which coffee-pot 
may rest 

Place coffee in strainer, strainer in coffee pot, and pot 
on the range. Add gradually boiling water, and allow it 
to filter. Cover between additions of water. If desired 
stronger, re-filter. Serve at once with cut sugar and cream. 

Put sugar and cream in cup before hot coffee. There will 
be perceptible difference if cream is added last. If cream is 
not obtainable, scalded milk may be substituted, or part 
milk and part cream may be used, if a diluted cup of coffee 
is desired. 

Boiled Coffee 

1 cup coffee 1 cup cold water 

1 Qgg 6 cups boiling water 

Scald granite-ware coffee-pot. Wash egg, break, and beat 
slightly. Dilute with one-half the cold water, add crushed 
shell, and mix with coffee. Turn into coffee-pot, pour on 
boiling water, and stir thoroughly. Place on front of range, 
and boil three minutes. If not boiled, coffee is cloudy ; if 
boiled too long, too much tannic acid is developed. The 
spout of pot should be covered or stuffed with soft paper to 
preveut escape of fragrant aroma. Stir and pour some in a 
cup to be sure that spout is free from grounds. Return to 
coffee-pot and repeat. Add remaining cold water, which 
perfects clearing. Cold water being heavier than hot water 
einks to the bottom, carrying grounds with it Place on 



38 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

back of range for ten minutes, where coffee will not boil. 
Serve at once. If any is left over, drain from grounds, and 
reserve for making of jelly or other dessert, 

£gg'Bbells may be saved and used for clearing coffee. 
Three egg-shells are sufficient to effect clearing where one 
cup of ground coffee is used. The shell performs no office 
in clearing except for the albumen which clings to it. Bur- 
nett's Crystal Coffee Settler, or salt fish skin, washed, dried, 
and cut in inch pieces, is used for same purpose. 

Coffee made with an egg has a rich flavor which egg alone 
can give. Where strict economy \a necessary, if great care 
is taken, egg may be omitted. Coffee so made should be 
served from range, as much motion causes it to become 
roiled. 

Tin is an undesirable material for a coffee-pot, as tannic 
acid acts on such metal and is apt to form a poisonous 
compound. 

When coffee and scalded milk are served in equal propor- 
tions, it is called CafS an lait. Coffee served with whipped 
cream is called Vienna Coffee. 

To Make a Small Pot of Coffee. Mix one cup ground 
coffee with one egg, sligbtly beaten, and crushed shell. To 
one-third of this amount add one-third cup cold water. 
Turn into a scalded coffee-pot, add one pint boiling water, 
and boil three minutes. Let stand on back of range ten 
minutes; serve. Keep remaining coffee and egg closely 
covered, in a cool place, to use two successive mornings. 

To Make Coffee for One. Allow two tablespoons ground 
coffee to one cup cold water. Add coffee to cold water, 
cover closely, and let stand over night. In the morning 
bring to a boiling-point. If carefully poured, a clear cup of 
coffee may be ser\^ed. 

After-Dixmer Coffee 

{Black Coffee, or Cafi Noir) 

For after-dinner coffee use twice the quantity of coffee, 
or half the amount of liquid, given in previous recipes. Fil* 
tered coffee is often preferred where milk or cream is not 



GOOOA AND OHOOOLATB 89 

used, as is always the case with black coffee. Serve in after- 
dinner coffee cups, with or without cut sugar. 

Coffee retards gastric digestion; but where the stomach 
has been overtaxed by a hearty meal, c&t^ noir may prove 
beneficial, so great are its stimalatii^ effects. 

KOLA 

The preparations on the maricet made from the kola-nut 
have much the same effect upon the system as eoffee and 
chocolate, inasmuch as they contain caffeine and theobro- 
mine ; they are also valuable for their diastase and a milk- 
digesting ferment. 

COCOA AHD CHOCOLATE 

The cacao-tree {Theobroma cacao) is native to Mexico. 
Although successfully cultivated between the twentieth par- 
allels of latitude, its industry is chiefly confined to Mexico, 
South America, and the West Indies. Cocoa and chocolate 
are both prepared from seeds of the cocoa beanv The 
bean pod is from seven to ten inches long, and three to four 
and one-half inches in diameter. Each pod contains from 
twenty to forty seeds, imbedded in mucili^inous material. 
Cocoa beans are dried previous to importation. Like coffee, 
they need roasting to develop flavor. After roasting, outer 
covering of bean is removed; this covering makes what is 
known as cocoa shells, which have little nutritive value. 
The beans are broken and sold as cocoa nibs. 

The various preparations of cocoa on the market are made 
from the ground cocoa nibs, from which, by means of hy- 
draulic pressure, a large amount of fat is expressed, leaving 
a solid cake. This in turn irf pulverized and mixed with 
sugar^ and frequently a small amount of corn-starch or arrow- 
root. To some preparations cinnamon or vanilla is added^ 
Broma contains both arrowroot and cinnamon. 

Chocolate is made from cocoa nibs, but contains a much 
larger proportion of fat than cocoa preparations. Bitter 
sweet, or flavored chocolate is always sold in cakes. 



40 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

The fat obtained from cocoa bean is cocoa butter, which 
gives cocoa its principal nutrient. 

Cocoa and chocolate differ from tea and coffee inasmuch 
as they contain nutriment as well as stimulant. Theobro- 
mme, the active principle, is almost identical with theine 
and caffeine in its composition and effects. 

Many people who abstain from the use of tea and coffee 
find cocoa indispensable. Not only is it valuable for its own 
nutriment, but for the large amount of milk added to it. 
Cocoa may be well placed in the dietary of a child after his 
third year, while chocolate should be avoided as a beverage^ 
but may be given as a confection. Invalids and those of 
weak digestion can take cocoa where chocolate would prove 
too rich. 

Cocoa Shells 
1 cup cocoa shells 6 cups boiling water 

Boil shells and water three hours; as water boils away 
it will be necessary to add more. Strain, and serve with 
milk and sugar. By adding one-third cup cocoa nibs, a 
much more satisfactory drink is obtained. 

Cracked Cocoa 

}4 cup cracked cocoa 3 pints boiling water 

Boil cracked cocoa and water two hours. Strain, and 
serve with milk and sugar. If cocoa is pounded in a mortar 
and soaked over night in three pints water, it will require 
but one hour's boiling.

milling.

CHAPTER IV 
BREAD AND BREAD MAKINO 

BREAD is the most important article of food, and history 
tells of its use thousands of years before the Christian 
era. Many processes have been employed in making and 
baking ; and as a result, from the first flat cake has come 
the perfect loaf. The study of bread making is of no slight 
importance, and deserves more attention than it receives. 

Considering its great value, it seems unnecessary and 
wrong to find poor bread on the table; and would that 
our standard might be raised as high as that of our friends 
across the water! Who does not appreciate the loaf pro- 
duced by the French baker, who has worked months to 
learn the art of bread making? 

Bread is made from flour of wheat, or other cereals, by 
addition of water, salt, and a ferment. Wheat flour is best 
adapted for bread making, as it contains gluten in the right 
proportion to make the spongy loaf. But for its slight de- 
ficiency in fat, wheat bread is a perfect food ; hence arose 
the custom of spreading it with butter. It should be remem- 
bered, in speaking of wheat bread as perfect food, that it 
must be made of flour rich in gluten. Next to wheat flour 
ranks rye in importance for bread making ; but it is best 
used in combination with wheat, for alone it makes heavy, 
sticky, moist bread. Corn also needs to be used in com- 
bination with wheat for bread making, for if used alone the 
bread will be crumbly. 

The miller, in order to produce flour which will make the 
white loaf (so sightly to many), in the process of grinding 
wheat has been forced to remove the inner bran coats, so 
rich in mineral matter, and much of the gluten intimately 
connected with them. 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 47 

To anderstand better the details of bread making, wheat, 
from which bread is principally made, should be considered. 

A grain of wheat consists of (1) an outer covering or 
husk, which is always removed before milling; (2) bran 
coats* which contain mineral matter ; (3) gluten, the proteid 
matter and fat; and (4) starch, the centre and largest part 
of the grain. Wheat is distinguished as white and soft^ or 
red and hard. The former is known as winter wheats having 
been sown in the fall, and living through the winter; the 
latter is known as spring wheats having been sown in the 
spring. From winter wheat, pastry flour, sometimes called 
St. Louis, is made; from spring wheat, bread flour, also 
called Haxall. St. Louis flour takes its name from the old 
process of grinding; Haxall, from the name of the inventor 
of the new process. All flours are now milled by the same 
process. For difference in composition of wheat flours, con- 
sult table in Chapter VI on Cereals. 

Wheat is milled for converting into flour by processes 
producing essentially the same results, all requiring cleans- 
ing, grinding, and bolting. Entire wheat flour has only the 
outer husk removetl, the remainder of the kernel being finely 
ground. Graham flour^ confounded with entire wheat, is 
too often found to be an inferior flour, mixed with coarse 
bran. 

Grinding is accomplished by one of four systems : (1) low 
milling ; (2) Hungarian system, or high milling ; (3) roller 
milling ; and (4) by a machine known as distintegrator. 

In low milling process, grooved stones are employed for 
gnmling. The stones ai-e enclosed in a metal case, and pro- 
vision is made within case for passage of air to prevent 
wheat from becoming overheated. The lower stone being 
permanently fixed, the upper stone being so balanced above 
it that grooves may exactly correspond, when upper stone 
rotates, sharp edges of grooves meet each other, and operate 
like a pair of scissors. By this process flour is made ready 
for bolting by one grinding. 

In high milling process, grooved stones are employed, but 
are kept so far apart that at first the wheat is only bruised, 
and a series of grindings and siftings is necessary. Iliis 



48 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

process is applicable only to the hardest wheats, and is par- 
tially supplanted by roller-milling. 

In roller-milling, wheat is subjected to action of a pair of 
steel or chilled-iron horizontal rollers, having toothed sur- 
faces. They revolve in opposite directions, at different rates 
of speed, and have a cutting action. 

Porcelain rollers, with rough surfaces, are sometimes em- 
ployed. In this system, grinding is accomplished by cutting 
rather than crushing. 

"The disintegrator consists of a pair of circular metal 
disks, set face to face, studded with circles of projecting 
bars so arranged that circles of bars on one disk alternate 
with those of the other. The disks are mounted on the same 
centre, and so closely set to one anotlier that projecting bars 
of one disk come quite close to plane surface of the other. 
They are inclosed within an external casing. The disks 
are caused to rotate in opposite directions with great rapid- 
ity, and the grain is almost instantaneously reduced to a 
powder." 

After grinding comes bolting, by which process the differ- 
ent grades of flour are obtained. The ground wheat is 
placed in octagonal cylinders (covered with silk or linen 
Dol ting-cloth of different degrees of fineness), which are 
allowed to rotate, thus forcing the wheat through. The 
flour from first siftings contains the largest percentage of 
gluten. 

Flour is branded under different names to suit manufac- 
turer or dealer. In consequence, the same wheat, milled by 
the same process, makes flour which is sold under different 
names. 

In buying flour, whether bread or pastry, select the best 
kept by your grocer. Some of the well-known brands of 
bread flour are King Arthur, Swansdown, Bridal Veil, 
Columbia. W:\ahbnni's Extra, and Pillsliury's Rest ; of pastry. 
Best St. Louis. Bread flour should be used in all cases 
where yeast is called for, with few exceptions; in other 
cases, pastry flour. The difference between bread and pas- 
try flour may be readily determined. Take bread flour in 
the hand, close hand tightly, then open, and flour will not 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 49 

keep in shape ; if allowed to pass through fiugers it will feel 
slightly granular. Take pastry flour in the hand^ close hand 
tightly, open, and flour will be in shape, having impression 
of the lines of the hand, and feeling soft and velvety to 
touch. Flour should always be sifted before measuring. 

Entire wheat flour differs from ordinary flour inasmuch 
as it contains all the gluten found in wheat, the outer husk 
of kernels only being removed, the remainder ground to 
different degrees of fineness and left unbolted. Such flours 
are now quite generally sold by all first class grocers. Included 
in this class is the Franklin Mills Company, the Pioneers, in 
making Fine Flour of the Entire Wheat 

Gluten, the proteid of wheat, is a gray, tough, elastic sub- 
stance, insoluble in water. On account of its great power 
of expansion, it holds the gas developed in bread dough by 
fermentation, which otherwise would escape. 

Teast 

Yeast is a microscopic plant of fungous growth, and is the 
lowest form of vegetable life. It consists of spores, or 
germs, found floating in air, and belongs to a family of 
which there are many species. These spores grow by bud- 
ding and division, and multiply very rapidly under favorable 
conditions, and produce fermentation. 

Fermentation is the process by which, under influence of 
air, warmth, moisture, and some ferment, sugar (or dex- 
trose, starch converted into sugar) is changed into alcohol 
(CaHjHO) and carbon dioxide (COg). The product of all 
fermentation is the same. Three kinds are considered, — 
alcoholic, acetic, and lactic. Where bread dough is allowed 
to ferment by addition of yeast, the fermentation is alcoTiolic ; 
where alcoholic fermentation continues too long, acetic fer- 
mentation sets in, which is a continuation of alcoholic. 
Lactic fermentation is fermentation which takes place when 
milk sours. 

Liquid, dry, or compressed yeast may be used for rais- 
ing bread. The compressed yeast cakes done up in tinfoil 
have long proved satisfactory, and are now almost uni- 
versally used, having replaced the home-made liquid yeast 

4 



50 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Never use a yeast cake unless perfectly fresh, which 
may be determined by its light color and absence of dark 
streaks. 

The yedst plant is killed at 212° F. ; life is suspended, but 
not entirely destroyed, 32° F. The temi)erature best suited 
for its growth is from 65° to 68° F. The most favorable 
conditions for the growth of yeast are a warm, moist, sweet, 
nitrogenous soil. These must be especially considered in 
bread making. 

Bread Making 

Fermented bread is made by mixing to a dough, fiour, 
with a definite quantity of water, milk, or water and milk, 
salt, and a ferment. Sugar is usually added to hasten fer- 
mentation. 13ough is then kneaded that the ingredients may 
be thoroughly incorporated, covered, and allowed to rise in 
a temperature of 68° F., until dough has doubled its bulk. 
This change has been caused by action of the ferment, which 
attacks some of the starch in flour, and changes it to sugar, 
and sugar in turn to alcohol and carbon dioxide, thus light- 
ening the whole mass. Dough is then kneaded a second 
time to break bubbles and distribute evenly the carbon 
dioxide. It is shaped in loaves, put in greased bread pans 
(they being half filled), covered, allowed to rise in tempera- 
ture same as for first rising, to double its bulk. If risen too 
long, it will be full of large holes ; if not risen long enough, 
it will be heavy and soggy. If pans containing loaves are 
put in too hot a place while rising, a heavy streak will be 
found near bottom of loaf. 

How to Shape Loaves and Biscuits. To shape bread 
dough in loaves, divide dough in parts, each part large 
enough for a loaf, knead until smooth, and if possible avoid 
seams in under part of loaf. If baked in brick pan, place 
two loaves in one pan, brushed between with a little melted 
butter. If baked in long shallow pan, when well kneaded, 
roll with both hands to lengthen, care being taken that it is 
smooth and of uniform thickness. Where long loaves are 
baked on sheets, shape and roll loosely in a towel sprinkled 
with corn meal for last rising. 



BREAD AND BREAD MAKING 51 

To shape bread dough in biscuits, pull or cut off as many 
small pieces (having them of unifoim size) as there are to be 
biscuits. Flour palms of hands slightly ; take up each piece 
and shape separately, lifting, with thumb and first two 
fingers of right hand, and placing in palm of left hand, con- 
stantly moving dough round and round, while folding to- 
wards the centre ; when smooth, turn it over and roll between 
palms of hands. Place in greased pans near together, 
brushed between with a little melted butter, which will cause 
biscuits to separate easily after baking. For finger rolls, 
shape biscuits and roll with one hand on part of board where 
there is no flour, until of desired length, care being taken to 
make smooth, of uniform size, and round at ends. 

Biscuits may be shaped in a great variety of ways, but 
they should always be small. Large biscuits, though equally 
good, never tempt one by their daintiness. 

Bread is often brushed over with milk before baking, to 
make a darker crust. 

Where bread is allowed to rise over night, a small piece 
of yeast cake must be used ; one-fourth yeast cake to one 
pint liquid is sufiScient, one-third yeast cake to one quart 
liquid. Bread mixed and baked during the day requires 
a larger quantity of yeast; one yeast cake, or sometimes 
even more, to one pint of liquid. Bread dough mixed with 
a large quantity of yeast should be watched during rising, 
and cut down as soon as mixture doubles its bulk. If proper 
care is taken, the bread will be found most satisfactory, 
having neither " yeasty ** nor sour taste. 

Fermented bread was formerly raised by means of leaven. 

Baking of Bread 

Bread is baked : (1) To kill ferment, (2) to make soluble 
the starch, (3) to drive off alcohol and carbon dioxide, and 
(4) to form brown crust of pleasant flavor. Bread should 
be baked in a hot oven. If the oven be too hot the crust 
will brown quickly before the heat has reached the centre, 
and prevent further rising ; loaf should continue rising for 
first fifteen minutes of baking, when it should begin to brown, 



62 BOSTON COOKING-80HOOL COOK BOOK 

and continue browning for the next twenty minutes. The 
last fifteen minutes it should finish baking, when the heat 
may be reduced. When bread is done, it will not cling to 
sides of pan, and may be easily removed. Biscuits require 
more heat than loaf bread, should continue rising the first 
five minutes, and begin to brown in eight minutes. Experi- 
ence is the best guide for testing temperature of oven. Vari- 
ous oven thermometers have been made, but none have 
proved practical. Bread may be brushed over with melted 
butter, three minutes before removal from oven, if a more 
tender crust is desired. 

Care of Bread after Baking 

Remove loaves at once from pans, and place side down 
on a wire bread or cake cooler. If a crisp crust is desired, 
allow bread to cool without covering; if soft crust, cover 
with a towel during cooling. When cool, put in tin box or 
stone jar, and cover closely. 

Never keep bread wrapped in cloth, as the cloth will ab- 
sorb moisture and transmit an unpleasant taste to bread. 
Bread tins or jars should be washed and scalded twice a 
week in winter, and every other day in summer; otherwise 
bread is apt to mould. As there are so many ways of using 
small and stale pieces of bread, care should be taken that 
none is wasted. 

Unfermented bread is raised without a ferment, the car- 
bon dioxide being produced by the use of soda (alkaline salt) 
and an acid. Soda, employed in combination with cream 
of tartar, for raising mixtures, in proportion of one-third 
soda to two-thirds cream of tartar, was formerly used to a 
great extent, but has been generally superseded by baking 
powder. 

Soda bicarbonate (NaHCOs) is manufactured from sodium 
chloride (NaCl), common salt or cryolite. 

Baking powder is composed of soda and cream of tartar 
in definite, correct proportions, mixed with small quantity 
of dry material (flour or cornstarch) to keep action from 
taking place. If found to contain alum or ammonia, it is 



BREAD AND BREAD IfAKING 53 

impure. lo using baking powder, allow two teaspoons 
baking powder to each cup of flour, when eggs are not used ; 
to egg mixtures allow one and one-half teaspoons baking 
powder. When a recipe calls for soda and cream of tartar, 
in substituting baking powder use double amount of cream 
of tartar given. 

These rules apply to the various soda and cream of 
tartar baking powders on the market. Horsford's Baking 
Powder, the only mineral one, requires one-third less than 
others. 

Soda and cream of tartar, or baking powder mixtures, are 
made light by liberation of gas in mixture ; the gas in soda 
is set free by the acid in cream of tartar ; in order to accom- 
plish this, moisture and heat are both required. As soon as 
moisture is added to baking powder mixtures, the gas will 
begin to escape ; hence the necessity of baking as soon as 
possible. If baking powder only is used for raising, put 
mixture to be cooked in a hot oven. 

Cream of tartar (HKC40yH4) is obtained from argols 
found adhering to bottom and sides of wine casks, which 
are ninety per cent cream of tartar. The argols are ground 
and dissolved in boiling water, coloring matter removed 
by filtering through animal charcoal, and by a process of 
recrystallization the cream of tartar of commerce is obtained. 

The acid found in molasses, sour milk, and lemon juice 
will liberate gas in soda, but the action is much quicker than 
when cream of tartar is used. 

Fermented and unfermented breads are raised to be made 
light and porous, that they may be easily acted upon by the 
digestive ferments. Some mixtures are made light by beat- 
ing sufficiently to enclose a large amount of air, and when 
baked in a hot oven air is forced to expand. 

Aerated bread is made light by carbon dioxide forced 
into dough under pressure. The carbon dioxide is generated 
from sulphuric acid and lime. Aerated bread is of close 
texture, and has a flavor peculiar to itself. It is a product 
of the baker's skill, but has found little favor except in few 
localities.

Water Bread 

2 caps boiling water l)^ teaspoons salt 

1 tablespoon butter ^ yeast cake dissolved in 

1 tablespoon lard j^ cup lukewarm water 

1 tablespoon sugar 6 cups sifted flour 

Put butter, lard, sugar, and salt in bread raiser, or large 
bowl without a lip ; pour on boiling water ; when lukewarm, 
add dissolved yeast cake and five cups of flour; then stir 
until thoroughly mixed, using a knife or mixing-spoon. 
Add remaining flour, mix, and turn on a floured board, leav- 
ing a clean bowl ; knead until mixture is smooth, elastic to 
touch, and bubbles may be seen under the surface. Some 
practice is required to knead quickly, but the motion once 
acquired will never be forgotten. Return to bowl, cover 
with a clean cloth kept for the purpose, and board or tin 
cover; let rise over night in temperature of 65° F. In 
morning cut down : this is accomplished by cutting through 
and turning over dough several times with a case knife, and 
checks fermentation for a short time ; dough may be again 
raised, and recut down if it is not convenient to shape into 
loaves or biscuits after first cutting. When properly cared 
for, bread need never sour. Toss on board slightly floured, 
knead, shape into loaves or biscuits, place in greased pans, 
having pans nearly half full. Cover, let rise again to double 
its bulk, and bake in hot oven. (See Baking of Bread and 
Time-Table for Baking.) This recipe will make a double 
loaf of bread and pan of biscuit. Cottolene, coto suet, or 
beef drippings may be used for shortening, one-third less 
being required. Bread shortened with butter has a good 
flavor, but is not as white as when lard is used.

mixed, raised, and baked in five hours, by using one yeast 
cake. Bread made in this way has proved most satisfac- 
tory. It is usually mixed in the morning, and the cook is 
able to watch the dough while rising and keep it at uni- 
form temperature. It is often desirable to place bowl con- 
taining dough in pan of water, keeping water at uniform 
temperature of from 95° to 100° F. Cooks who have not 
proved themselves satisfactory bread makers are successful 
when employing this method. 

Entire Wheat Bread 

2 cups scalded milk 1 teaspoon salt

warm add dissolved yeast cake and flour ; beat well, cover, 
and let rise to double its bulk. Again beat, and turn into 
greased bread pans, having pans one-half full ; let rise, and 
bake. Entire Wheat Bread should not quite double its bulk 
during last rising. This mixture may be baked in gem pans. 

German Caraway Bread 

Follow recipe for Milk and Water Bread (see p. 54), 
using rye flour in place of entire wheat flour, and one table- 
spoon sugar for sweetening. After first rising while knead- 
ing add one-third tablespoon caraway seed. Shape, let rise 
again, and bake in a loaf. 

Bntire Wheat and White Flour Bread 

Use same ingredients as for Entire Wheat Bread, with 
exception of flour. For flour use three and one-fourth cups 
entire wheat and two and three-fourths cups white flour. 
The dough should be slightly kneaded, and if handled 
quickly will not stick to board. Loaves and biscuits should 
be shaped with hands instead of pouring into pans, as in 
Entire Wheat Bread.

dough is better suited for biscuits, but, being soft, is difii- 
cult to handle. To make shaping of biscuits easy, take up 
mixture by spoonfuls, drop into plate of flour, and have 
palms of hands well covered with flour before attempting to 
shape.

until well mixed, turn into a well-buttered mould, and steam 
three and one-half hours. The cover should be buttered 
before being placed on mould, and then tied down with 
string ; otherwise the bread in rising might force off cover. 
Mould should never be filled more than two-thirds full. A 
melon-mould or one-pound baking-powder boxes make the 
most attractive-shaped loaves, but a five-pound lard pail 
answers the purpose. For steaming, place mould on a trivet 
in kettle containing boiling water, allowing water to come 
half-way up around mould, cover closely, and steam, adding, 
as needed, more boiling water.

melted butter, fold, and press edges together. Place in 
greased pan, one inch apart, cover, let rise, and bake in hot 
oven twelve to fifteen minutes. As rolls rise they will part 
slightly, and if hastened in rising are apt to lose their 
shape. 

Parker House Rolls may be shaped by cutting or tearing 
off small pieces of dough, and shaping round like a biscuit ; 
place in rows on floured board, cover, and let rise fifteen 
minutes. With handle of large wooden spoon, or toy roll- 
ing-pin, roll through centre of each biscuit, brush edge of 
lower halves with melted butter, fold, press lightly, place in 
buttered pan one inch apart, cover, let rise, and bake. 

Salad or Dinner Rolls 

Use same ingredients as for Parker House Rolls, allowing 
one-fourth cup butter. Shape in small biscuits, place in 
rows on a floured board, cover with cloth and pan, and let 
rise until light and well puffed. Flour handle of wooden 
spoon and make a deep crease in middle of each biscuit, 
take up, and press edges together. Place closely in buttered 
pan, cover, let rise, and bake twelve to fifteen minutes in 
hot oven. From this same mixture crescents, braids, twists, 
bow-knots, clover leaves, and other fancy shapes may be 
made.

To shape sticks, first shape as small biscuits, roll on board 
(where there is no flour) with hands until eight inches in 
length, keeping of uniform size and rounded ends, w^hich 
may be done by bringing fingers close to, but not over, 
ends of sticks.

color a golden brown on each side. Toast, if piled compactly 
and allowed to stand, will soon become moist. Toast may 
be buttered at table or before sending to table.

Dip slices of dry toast quickly in boiling salted water, 
allowing one-half teaspoon salt to one cup boiling water. 
Spread slices with butter, and serve at once.

brown other side. Serve for breakfast or luncheon, or with 
a sauce for dessert. 

Bre^vls 

Break stale bits or slices of brown and white bread in 
small pieces, allowing one and one-half cups brown bread to 
one- half cup white bread. Butter a hot frying pan, put in 
bread, and cover with equal parts milk and water. Cook 
until soft; add butter and salt to taste. 

Bread for Garnishing 

Dry toast is often used for garnishing, cut in various 
shapes. Always shape before toasting. Cubes of bread, 
toast points, and small oblong pieces are most common. 
Cubes of stale bread, from which centres are removed, are 
fried in deep fat and called croustades; half-inch cubes, 
browned in butter^ or fried in deep fat, are called crodtons. 

Uses for Stale Bread 

All pieces of bread should be saved and utilized. Large 
pieces are best for toast. Soft stale bread, from which 
crust is removed, when crumbed, is called stale bread crumbs, 
or raspings, and is used for puddings, griddle-cakes, omelets, 
scalloped dishes, and dipping food to be fried. Remnants 
of bread, from which crusts have not been removed, are 
dried in oven, rolled^ and sifted. These are called dry bread 
crumbs, and are useful for crumbing croquettes, cutlets, 
fish, meat, etc.

Batten, Sponges, and Doughs 

BATTER is a mixture of flour and some liquid (usually 
combined with other ingredients, as sugar, salt, eggs, 
etc.), of consistency to pour easily, or to drop from a spoon. 
Batters are termed thin or thick, according to their 
consistency. 

Sponge is a batter to which yeast is added. 
Dough differs from batter inasmuch as it is stiff enough to 
be bandied. 

Cream Scones

to differences in flour. Toss on a floured board, pat and 
roll lightly to one-half inch in thickness. Shape with a bis- 
cuit-cotter. Place on buttered pan, and bake in hot oven 
twelve to fifteen minutes. If baked in too slow an oven, the 
gas will escape before it has done its work. Many obtain 
better results by using bread flour.

CHAPTER VI 
GEBEALS 

CEREALS (cultivated grasses) rank first among vege« 
table foods; being of hardy growth and easy culti- 
vation, they are more widely diffused over the globe than 
any of the flowering plants. They include wheat, oats, 
rye, barley, maize (Indian corn), and rice ; some authori- 
ties place buckwheat among them. Wheat probably is the 
most largely consumed ; next to wheat, comes rice.

Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 

Macaroniy spagJietti, and vermicelli are made from wheaten 
flour, rich in gluten, moistened to a stiff dough with water, 
and forced through small apertures in an iron plate by 
means of a screw press. Various Italian pastes are made 
from the same mixture. Macaroni is manufactured to 
some extent in this country, but the best comes from Italy, 
Lagana and Pejero, being the favorite brand. When maca- 
roni is colored, it is done by the use of saffron, not by eggs, 
as is generally supposed. The only egg macaroni is manu- 
factured in strips, and comes from Minneapolis. 



86 BOSTON COOKIKG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Macaroni is valuable food, as it is very cheap and nutri- 
tious; but being deficient in fat, it should be combined 
with cream, butter, or cheese, to make a perfect food. 

From cereals many preparations are made, used alone, 
or in combination with other food products. From rice 
is made rice flour; from oats, oatmeal, and oats steam- 
cooked and rolled, — as Rolled Avena, Quaker Rolled Oats, 
H-0, etc. There are many species of corn, the principal 
varieties being white, yellow, and red. From corn is made 
corn meal, — both white and yellow, — cornstarch, hominy, 
maizena, cerealine, samp, and hulled corn; from wheat, 
wheaten or white flour, Wheatena, Wheatlet, Rolled Wheat, 
Pettijohn's, etc. Rye is useS for Rye Flakes, meal, and flour ; 
barley, for flour and pearl barley. Buckwheat, throughout 
the United States, is used only when made into flour for 
buckwheat cakes. 

For family use, cereals should be bought in small quanti- 
ties, and kept in glass jars, tightly covered. Many cereal 
preparations are on the market for making breakfast mushes, 
put up in one and two pound packages, with directions for 
cooking. In nearly all cases, time allowed for cooking is 
not sufficient, unless dish containing cereal is brought ia 
direct contact with fire, which is not the best way. Mushes 
should be cooked over hot water after the first five minutes ; 
if a double boiler is not procurable, improvise one. Boiling 
water and salt should always be added to cereals, allowing 
one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal, — boiled to soften 
cellulose and swell starch grains, salted to give flavor. 
Indian meal and finely ground preparations should be 
mixed with cold water before adding boiling water, to 
prevent lumping.

1 tablespoon salt 

French Chef 

Pick over rice ; add slowly to boiling, salted water, 
so as not to check boiling of water. Boil thirty minutes, 
or until soft, which may be determined by testing ker- 
nels. Old rice absorbs much more water than new rice, 
and takes longer for cooking. Drain in coarse strainer, 
and pour over one quart hot water ; return to kettle 
in which it was cooked; cover, place on back of range, 
and let stand to dry off, when kernels are distinct. 
When stirring rice, always use a fork to avoid breaking 
kernels.

1 teaspoon salt (according to age of rice)

a fork to prevent adhering to boiler. Boil five minutes, 
cover, place over under part double boiler, and steam forty- 
five minutes, or until kernels are soft ; uncover, that steam 
may escape. When rice is steamed for a simple dessert, 
use one-half quantity of water given in recipe, and steam 
until rice has absorbed water; then add scalded milk for 
remaining liquid. 

To wash rice. Put rice in strainer, place strainer over 
bowl nearly full of cold water ; rub rice between hands, lift 
strainer from bowl, and change water. Repeat process three 
or four times, until water is quite clear.

CHAPTER VII 
EGOS 

OOMPOBITIOX 

Proteid, 14.9% Mineral matter, 1% 

Fat, 10.6% Water, 73.5% 

EGGS, like milk, form a typical food, inasrauch as they 
contain all the elements, in the right proportion, neces- 
sary for the support of the body. Their highly concentrated, 
nutritive value renders it necessary to use them in combina- 
tion with other foods rich in starch (bread, potatoes, etc.). 
In order that the stomach may have enough to act upon, a 
certain amount of bulk must be furnished. 

A pound of eggs (nine) is equivalent in nutritive value to 
a pound of beef. From this it may be seen that eggs, at 
even twenty-five cents per dozen, should not be freely used 
by the strict economist. Eggs being rich in proteid ser\'e as 
a valuable substitute for meat. In most families, their use 
in the making of cake, custard, puddings, etc., renders them 
almost indispensable. It is surprising how many intelligent 
women, who look well to the aflfairs of the kitchen, are satis- 
fied to use what are termed *• cooking eggs"; this shows 
poor judgment from an economical standpoint. Strictly 
fresh eggs should always be used if obtainable. An egg 
after the first twenty four hours steadily deteriorates. If 
exposed to air, owing to the porous structure of the shell, 
there is an evaporation of water, air rushes in, and decom- 
position takes place. 

White of egg contains albumen in its purest form. Al- 
bumen coagulates at a temperature of from 134° to 160° F. 
Herein lies the importance of cooking eggs at a low tempera- 
ture, thus rendering them easy of digestion. Eggs cooked 



EOGS 96 

in boiling water are tough and horny, difficult of digestion, 
and should never be served. 

When eggs come from the market, they should be washed, 
and put away in a cold place. 

Ways of Determining Freshness of Eggs. I. Hold in front 
of candle flame in dark room, and the centre should look 
clear. 

II. Place in basin of cold water, and they should sink. 

III. Place large end to the cheek, and a warmth should 
be felt 

Ways of Keeping Eggs. I. Pack in sawdust, small end 
down. 

II. Keep in lime water. 

III. From July to September a large number of eggs are 
packed, small ends down, in cases having compartments, 
one for each egg, and kept in cold storage. Eggs are often 
kept in cold storage six months, and then sold as cooking 
eggs. 

Boiled Eggs 

Have ready a saucepan containing boiling water. Care- 
fully put in with a spoon the number of eggs desired, cover- 
ing them with water. Remove saucepan to back of range, 
where water will not boil. Cook from six to eight minutes 
if liked ** soft-boiled," forty to forty-five if liked •' hard- 
boiled." Eggs may be cooked by placing in cold water and 
allowing water to heat gradually until the boiling-point is 
reached, when they will be *^soft boiled." In using hard- 
boiled eggs for making other dishes, when taken from the 
hot water they should be plunged into cold water to prevent, 
if possible, discoloration of yolks. 

Eggs perfectly cooked should be placed and kept in water 
at a uniform temperature of 175° F. 

Dropped Egga (Poached) 
Have ready a shallow pan two-thirds full of boiling salted 
water, allowing one-half tablespoon salt to one quart of 
water. Put two or three buttered muffin rings in the water. 
Break each egg separately into a cup, and carefully slip into 
a muffin ring. The water should cover the eggs. When 



96 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

there is a film over the top, and the white is firm, carefully 
remove with a buttered skimmer to circular pieces of but- 
tered toast, and let each person season his own egg with 
butter, salt, and pepper. If cooked for an invalid, garnish 
with four toast-points and a bit of parsley. An egg-poacher 
may be used instead of muffin rings.

serve on buttered toast. Strain cream over the toast. 

Eggs Susette 

Wash and bake six large potatoes, cut slice from top of 
each, scoop out inside, and mash. To three cups mashed 
potato add six tablespoons finely chopped ham, two table- 
spoons finely chopped parsley, whites of two eggs well 
beaten, three tablespoons butter, four tablespoons cream, 
and salt and pepper. Line potato shells with mixture, place 
in each cavity a poached egg, cover with potato mixture, 
and bake until browned. Care must be taken to have eggs 
delicat^'ly parched. 



EGGS 97 

Baked or Shirred Eggs 

Butter an egg-shirrer. Cover bottom and sides with fine 
cracker crumbs. Break an egg into a cup, and carefully 
slip into shirrer. Cover with seasoned buttered crumbs, 
and bake in moderate oven until white is firm and crumbs 
brown. The shirrers should be placed on a tin plate, that 
they may be easily removed from the oven.

omelet pan. 

Plain Omelet 

4 eggs 4 tablespoons hot water 

)4 teaspoon salt 1 tablespoon butter 

Few grains pepper 1}^^ cups Thin White Sauce 

Separate yolks from whites. To yolks add salt, pepper, 
and hot water and beat until thick and lemon-colored. Beat 
whites until stiff and dry, cutting and folding them into 
first mixture until they have taken up mixture. Heat omelet 
pan, and butter sides and bottom. Turn in mixture, spread 
evenly, place on range where it will cook slowly, occa- 
sionally turning the pan that omelet may brown evenly. 
When well "puffed" and delicately browned underneath, 
place pan on centre grate of oven to finish cooking the top. 
The omelet is cooked if it is firm to the touch when pressed 
by the finger. If it clings to the finger like the beaten white 
of egg, it needs longer cooking. Fold, and turn on hot plat- 
ter, and pour around one and one-half cups Thin White 
Sauce 

Milk is sometimes used in place of hot water, but hot 
water makes a more tender omelet. A few grains baking 
powder are used by some cooks to hold up an omelet.

SOUPS 109 



CHAPTER VIII 
SOUPS 

IT cannot be denied that the French excel all nations in 
the excellence of their cuisine, and to their soups and 
sauces belong the greatest praise. It would be well to follow 
their example, and it is the duty of every housekeeper to 
learn the art of soup making. How may a hearty dinner be 
better begun than with a thin soup ? The hot liquid, taken 
into an empty stomach, is easily assimilated, acts as a stim- 
ulant rather than a nutrient (as is the popular opinion), and 
prepares the way for the meal which is to follow. The 
cream soups and purees are so nutritious that, with bread 
and butter, they furnish a satisfactory meal. 

Soups are divided into two great classes: soups with 
stock ; soups without stock. 

Soups with stock have, for their basis, beef, veal, mutton, 
fish, poultry, or game, separately or in combination. They 
are classified as : — 

Bouilloii, made from lean beef, delicately seasoned, and 
usually cleared. Exception, — clam bouillon. 

Brown Soup Stock, made from beef (two-thirds lean meat, 
and remainder bone and fat), highly seasoned with vegeta- 
bles, spices, and sweet herbs. 

White Soup Stock, made from chicken or veal, with deli- 
cate seasonings. 

Coiiaomm6, usually made from two or three kinds of meat 
(beef, veal, and fowl being employed), highly seasoned with 
vegetables, spices, and sweet herbs. Always served, clear. 

I«amb Stock, delicately seasoned, is served as mutton 
broth. 

Soups without stock are classified as : — 

Cream Soups, made of vegetables or fish, with milk, and a 
small amount of cream and seasonings. Always thickened. 

Fnr^B, made from vegetables or fish, forced through 



110 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

a strainer, and retained in soup, milk, and seasonings. 
Generally thicker than cream soup. Sometimes* White Stock 
is added. 

Bisqaes, generally made from shell-fish, milk, and sea- 
sonings, and sei-ved with fish dice ; made similarly to parses. 
Tbey may be made of meat, game, or vegetables, with small 
dice of the same. 

Various names have been given to soups, according to 
their flavorings, chief ingredients, the people who use them, 
etc. To the Scotch belongs Scotch Broth ; to the French, 
Pot-au-feu ; to the Indo, Mulligatawny ; and to the Spanish, 
Olla Podrida. 

SOUP KAKDra 

The art of soup making is more easily mastered than at 
first appears. The young housekeeper is startled at the 
amazingly large number of ingredients the recipe calls for, 
and often is discouraged. One may, with but little expense, 
keep at hand what is essential for the making of a good 
soup. Winter vegetables — turnips, carrots, celery, and 
onions — may be bought in large or small quantities. The 
outer stalks of celery, often not suitable for serving, should 
be saved for soups. At seasons when celery is a luxury, 
the tips and roots should be saved and dried. Sweet herbs, 
including thyme, savory, and marjoram, are dried and put 
up in packages, retailing from five to ten cents. Bay leaves, 
which should be used sparingly, may be obtained at firet- 
class grocers' or druggists' ; seeming never to lose strength, 
they may be kept indefinitely. Spices, including whole 
cloves, allspice berries, peppercorns, and stick cinnamon, 
should be kept on hand. These seasonings, with the addi- 
tion of salt, pepper, and parsley, are the essential flavorings 
for stock soups. Flour, cornstarch, arrowroot, fine tapioca, 
sago, pearl barley, rice, bread, or eggs are added to give 
consistency and nourishment. 

In small families, where there are few left-overs, fresh 
meat must be bought for the making of soup stock, as a 
good soup cannot be made from a small amount of poor 
material. On the other hand, large families need seldom 



SOUPS 111 

buy fresh meat, provided all left-overs are properly cared 
for. The soup kettle should receive small pieces of beef 
(roasted, broiled, or stewed), veal, carcasses of fowl or 
cbickeD, chop bones, bones left from lamb roast, and all 
trimmings and bones, which a careful housewife should see 
are sent from the market with her order. Avoid the use of 
smoked or corned meats, or large pieces of raw mutton or 
lamb surrounded by fat, on account of the strong flavor so 
disagreeable to many. A small piece of bacon or lean ham 
is sometimes cooked with vegetables for flavor. 

Beef ranks first as regards utility and economy in soup 
making. It should be cut from the fore or hind shin (which 
cuts contain marrow-bone), the middle cuts being most de- 
sirable. If the lower part of shin is used, the soup, although 
rich in gelatin, lacks flavor, unless a cheap piece of lean meat 
is used with it, which frequently is done. It must be remem- 
bered that meat, bone, and fat in the right proportions are 
all necessary; allow two-thirds lean meat, the remaining 
one-third bone and fat. From the meat the soluble juices, 
saltSy extractives (which give color and flavor), and a small 
quantity of gelatin are extracted ; from the bone, gelatin 
(which gives the stock when cold a jelly-like consistency) 
and mineral matter. Gelatin is also obtained from cartilage, 
skin, tendons, and ligaments. Some of the fat is absorbed ; 
the remainder rises to the top and should be removed. 

Soup-stock making is rendered easier by use of proper 
utensils. Sharp meat knives, hardwood board, two pur^e 
strainers having meshes of different size, and a soup digester 
(a porcelain-lined iron pot, having tight-fitting cover, with 
valve in the top), or covered granite kettle, are essentials. 
An iron kettle, which formerly constituted one of the fur- 
nishings of a range, may be used if perfectly smooth. A 
saw, cleaver, and scales, although not necessary, are useful, 
and lighten labor. 

When meat comes from market, remove from paper and 
put in cool place. When ready to start stock, if scales are 
at hand, weigh meat and bone to see if correct proportions 
have been sent. Wipe meat with clean cheesecloth wrung 
oat of cold water. Cut lean meat in one-inch cubes ; by so 



112 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

doing, a large amount of surface is exposed to the water, 
and juices are more easily drawn out. Heat frying-pan 
hissing hot; remove marrow from marrow-bone, and use 
enough to brown one-third of the lean meat, stirring con- 
stantly, that all parts of surface may be seared, thus pre- 
venting escape of juices, — sacrificing a certain amount of 
goodness in the stock to give additional color and flavor, 
which is obtained by caramelization. Put fat, bone, and 
remaining lean meat in soup kettle ; cover with cold water, 
allowing one pint to each pound of meat, bone, and fat. 
Let stand one hour, that cold water may draw out juices 
from meat. Add browned meat, taking water from soup 
kettle to rinse out frying-pan, that none of the coloring may 
be lost. Heat gradually to boiling-point, and cook six or 
seven hours at low temperature. A scum will rise on the 
top, which contains coagulated albuminous juices ; these give 
to soup its chief nutritive value ; many, however, prefer a 
clear soup, and have them removed. If allowed to remain, 
when straining, a large part will pass through strainer. 
Vegetables, spices, and salt should be added the last hour 
of cooking. Strain and cool quickly ; by so doing, stock is 
less apt to ferment. A knuckle of veal is often used for 
making white soup stock. Fowl should be used for stock in 
preference to chicken, as it is cheaper, and contains a larger 
amount of nutriment. A cake of fat forms on stock when 
cold, which excludes air, and should not be removed until 
stock is used. To remove fat, run a knife around edge of 
bowl and carefully remove the same. A small quantity will 
remain, which should be removed by passing a cloth wrung 
out of hot water around edge and over top of stock. This 
fat should be clarified and used for drippings. If time can- 
not be allowed for stock to cool before using, take off as 
much fat as possible with a spoon, and remove the remainder 
by passing tissue or any absorbent paper over the surface. 

Bow to Clear Soup Stock 

Whites of eggs slightly beaten, or raw, lean beef finely 
chopped, are employed for clearing soup stock. The al- 



SOUPS 113 

bumen found in each effects the clearing by drawing to itself 
some of the juices which have been extracted from the meat, 
and by action of heat have been coagulated. Some rise to 
the top and form a scum, others are precipitated. 

Remove fat from stock, and put quantity to be cleared in 
stew-pan, allowing white and shell of one egg to each quart 
of stock. Beat egg slightly, break shell iu small pieces and 
add to stock. Place on front of range, and stir constantly 
until boiling-point is reached ; boil two minutes. Set back 
where it may simmer twenty minutes; remove scum, and 
strain through double thickness of cheesecloth placed over 
a fine strainer. If stock to be cleared is not sufficiently sea- 
soned, additional seasoning must be added as soon as stock 
has lost its jelly-like consistency ; not after clearing is 
effected. Many think the flavor obtained from a few shav- 
ings of lemon rind an agreeable addition. 

How to Bind Soups 

Cream soups and purees, if allowed to stand, separate, 
unless bound together. To bind a soup, melt butter, and 
when bubbling add an equal quantity of flour; when well 
mixed add to boiling soup, stirring constantly. If recipe 
calls for more flour than butter, or soup is one that should 
be made in double boiler, add gradually a portion of hot 
mixture to butter and flour until of such consistency that it 
may be poured into the mixture remaining in double boiler.

FISH 151 



CHAPTER XI 
FISH 

THE meat of fish is the animal food next in importance 
to that of bii-ds and mammals. Fish meat, with but 
few exceptions, is less stimulating and nourishing than meat 
of other animals, but is usually easier of digestion. Salmon, 
mackerel, and eels are exceptions to these rules, and should 
not be eaten by those of weak digestion. White Ush, on 
account of their easy digestibility^ are especially desirable 
for those of sedentary habits. Fish is not recommended for 
brain-workers on account of the large amount of phosphorus 
(an element abounding largely in nerve tissue) which it con- 
tains, but because of its easy digestibility. It is a conceded 
fact that many fish contain less of this element than meat. 

Fish meat is generally considered cheaper than meat of 
other animals. This is true when compared with the better 
cuts of meat, but not so when compared with cheaper cuts. 

To obtain from fish its greatest value and flavor, it should 
be eaten fresh, and in season. Turbot, which is improved 
by keeping, is the only exception to this rule. 

To Determine Freshness of Fish, Examine the flesh, and 
it should be firm; the eyes and gills, and they should be 
bright. 

Broiling and baking are best methods for cooking fish. 
White fish may often be fried, but oily rarely. Frozen fish 
are undesirable, but if used, should be thawed in cold water 
just before cooking. 

On account of its strong odor, fish should never be put in 
an ice-box with other food, unless closely covered. A tin 
lard pail will be found useful for this purpose. 



152 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

White and OUy Fioh 

White fish have fat secreted in the liver. Examples : cod, 
haddock, trout, flounder, smelt, perch, etc. 

Oily fish have fat distributed throughout the fiesh. Ex- 
amples: salmon, eels, mackerel, bluefish, swordfish, shad, 
herring, etc. 

Cod belongs to one of the most prolific fish families 
(Gadidoe), and is widely distributed throughout the northern 
and temperate seas of both hemispheres. On account of its 
abundance, cheapness, and easy procurability, it forms, 
from an economical standpoint, one of the most important 
fish foods. Cod have been caught weighing over a hundred 
pounds, but average market cod weigh from six to ten 
pounds ; a six-pound cod measures about twenty-three inches 
in length. Large cod' are cut into steaks. The skin of cod 
is white, heavily mottled with gray, with a white line run- 
ning the entire length of fish on either side. Cod is caught 
in shallow or deep waters. Shallow-water cod (caught off 
rocks) is called rock cod ; deep-water cod is called off-shore 
cod. Rock cod are apt to be wormy. Cod obtained off 
George's Banks, Newfoundland, are called Geoi^e's cod, 
and are commercially known as the best fish. Quantities of 
cod are preserved by drying and salting. Salted George's 
cod is the best brand on the market Cod is in season 
throughout the year. 

Cod Liver Oil is obtained from cods* livers, and has great 
therapeutic value. Isinglass, made from swimming bladder 
of cod, nearly equals in quality that made from bladder of 
sturgeon. 

Haddock is more closely allied to cod than any other fish. 
It is smaller (its average weight being about four pounds), 
and differently mottled. The distinguishing mark of the 
haddock is a black line running the entire length of fish on 
either side. Haddock is found in the same water and in 
company with cod, but not so abundantly. Like cod, had- 
dock is cheap, and in season throughout the year. Haddock, 
when dried, smoked, and salted, is known as Finnan Haddie. 

Halibut is the largest of the fiatfish family (Pleuronectidae), 



FISH 153 

specimens haviDg been caught weighing from three to four 
hundred pounds. Small, or chicken, halibut is the kind 
usually found in market, and weighs from fifteen to twenty- 
five pounds. Halibut are distinctively cold-water fish, being 
caught in water at from 32° to 45° F. They are found in 
the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, where they are 
nearly identical. The halibut has a compressed body, the 
skin on one side being white, on the other light, or dark gray, 
and both eyes are found on the dark side of head. Halibut 
is in season throughout the year. 

Tnrbot (called little halibut) is a species of the flatfish 
family, being smaller than halibut, and of more delicate 
flavor. Turbot are in season from January to March. 

Flounder is a small flatfish, which closely resembles the 
sole which is caught in English waters, and is often served 
under that name. 

Trout are generally fresh- water fish, varying much in size 
and skin-coloring. Lake trout, which are the largest, reach 
their greatest perfection in Lakes Huron, Michigan, and 
Superior, but are found in many lakes. Salmon trout is the 
name applied to trout caught in New York lakes. Brook 
trout, caught in brooks and small lakes, are superior eating. 
Trout are in season from April to August, but a few are 
found later. 

'Whitefish is the finest fish found in the Great Lakes. 

Smelts are small salt-water fish, and are usually caught in 
temperate waters at the mouths of rivers. New Brunswick 
and Maine send large quantities of smelts to market. 
Selected smelts are the largest in size, and command higher 
price. The Massachusetts Fish and Game Protective Law 
forbids their sale from March 15th to June 1st. Smelts are 
always sold by the pound. 

Bluefish belongs to the Pomatomidse family. It is widely 
distributed in temperate waters, taking different names in 
different localities. In New England and the Middle States 
it is generally called Bluefish, although in some parts called 
Snappers, or Snapping Mackerel. In the Southern States it 
is called Greenfish. It is in season in our markets from May 
to October; as it is frozen and kept in cold storage from 



164 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

six to nine months, it may be obtained throughout the year. 
The heavier the fish, the better its quality. Bluefish weigh 
from one to eight pounds^ and are from fourteen to twenty, 
nine inches in length. 

Mackerel is one of the best-known food fishes, and is 
caught in North Atlantic waters. Its skin is lustrous dark 
blue above, with wavy blackish lines, and silvery below. It 
sometimes attains a length of eighteen inches, but is usually 
less. Mackerel weigh from three-fourths of a pound to two 
pounds, and are sold by the piece. They are in season from 
May 1st to September 1st. Mackerel, when first in market, 
contain less fat than later in the season, therefore are easier 
of digestion. The supply of mackerel varies greatly from 
year to year, and some years is very small. Spanish 
inackerel are found in waters farther south than common 
mackerel, and in our markets command higher price. 

Salmon live in both fresh and salt waters, always goings 
inland, usually to the head of rivers, during the spawning 
season. The young after a time seek salt water, but 
generally return to fresh water. Penobscot River Salmon 
are the best, and come from Maine and St John, New 
Brunswick. The average weight of salmon is from fifteen 
to twenty-five pounds, and the flesh is of pinkish orange 
color. Salmon are in season from May to September, but 
frozen salmon may be obtained the greater part of the year. 
In the Columbia Elver and its tributaries salmon are so abun- 
dant that extensive canneries are built along the banks. 

Shad, like salmon, are found in both salt and fresh water, 
always ascending rivers for spawning. Shad is caught on 
the Atlantic Coast of the United States, and its capture con- 
stitutes one of the most important fisheries. Shad have a 
silvery hue, which becomes bluish on the back ; they vary in 
length from eighteen to twenty-eight inches, and are always 
sold by the piece, price being irrespective of size. Jack shad 
are usually cheaper than roe shad. The roe of shad is highly 
esteemed. Shad are in season from January to June. First 
shad in market come from Florida, and retail from one and 
one-half to two dollars each. The finest come from New 
Brunswick, and ap[)ear in market about the first of May. 



SHELLFISH 155 

Caviare is the salted roe of the stargeon. 
Herring are usually smoked, or smoked and salted, and, 
heing very cheap, are a most economical food. 

SHELinSH 

Z. Bivalve MoUusks 

Oysters are mollusks, having two shells. The shells are 
on the right and left side of the oyster, and are called right 
and left valves. The one upon which the oyster rests grows 
faster, becomes deeper, and is known as the left valve. 
The valves are fastened by a ligament, which, on account of 
its elasticity, admits of opening and closing of the shells. 
The oyster contains a tough muscle, by which it is attached 
to the shell ; the body is made up largely of the liver (which 
contains glycogen^ animal starch), and is partially surrounded 
by fluted layers, which are the gills. Natural oyster beds 
(or banks) are found in shallow salt water having stony bot- 
tom, along the entire Atlantic Coast. The oyster industry 
of the world is chiefly in the United States and France, and 
on account of its increase many artificial beds have been 
prepared for oyster culture. Oysters are five years old be- 
fore suitable for eating. Blue Points, which are small, 
plump oysters, take their name from Blue Point, Long 
Island, from which place they originally came. Their popu- 
larity grew so rapidly that the supply became inadequate for 
the demand, and any small, plump oysters were soon sold 
for Blue Points. During the oyster season they form the 
first course of a dinner, served raw on the half-shell. In 
our markets, selected oysters (which are extremely large and 
used for broiling) Providence River, and Norfolk oysters are 
familiarly known, and, taken out of the shells, are sold by 
the quart. Farther south, they are sold by count. 

Oysters are obtainable all the year, but are in season from 
September to May. Dunng the summer months they are 
flabby and of poor flavor, although when fresh they are per- 
fectly wholesome. Mussels^ eaten in England and other 
parts of Europe, are similar to oysters, though of inferior 



166 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

quality. Oysters are nutritious and of easy digestibility, 
especially when eaten raw. 

To Open Oysters. Put a thin flat knife under the back 
end of the right valve, and push forward until it cuts the 
strong muscle which holds the shells together. As soon as 
this is done, the right valve may be raised and separated 
from the left. 

To Clean Oysters, Put oysters in a strainer placed over a 
bowl. Pour over oysters cold water, allowing one-half cup 
water to each quart oysters. Carefully pick over oysters, 
taking each one separately in the Angers, to remove any 
particles of shell which adhere to tough muscle. 

Clams, among bivalve moUusks, rank in value next to 
oysters. They are found just below the surface of sand and 
mud, above low- water mark, and are easily dug with shovel or 
rake. Clams have hard or soft shells. Soft-shell clams are 
dear to the New Englander. From New York to Florida 
are found hard-shelled clams (quahaugs). Small quahaygs 
are called Zittle Neck Clams and take the place of Blue 
Points at dinner, when Blue Points are out of season. 

ScaUopa are bivalve mollusks, the best being found in 
Long Island Sound and Narragansett Bay. The central 
muscle forms the edible portion, and is the only part sent to 
market. Scallops are in season from October first to April 
first. 

n. CroBtaoeana 

Lobsters belong to the highest order of Crustaceans, live 
exclusively in sea-water, generally near rocky coasts, and 
are caught in pots set on gravelly bottoms. The largest 
and best species are found in Atlantic waters from Maine 
to New Jersey, being most abundant on Maine and Massa- 
chusetts coasts. Lobsters have been found weighing from 
sixteen to twenty-five pounds, but such have been exter- 
minated from our coast. The average weight is two 
pounds, and the length from ten to fifteen inches. Lol>- 
sters are largest and most abundant from June to Septem« 
ber, but are obtainable all the year. When taken from 
the water, shells are of mottled dark green color, except 



8UKLLFI8H 157 

when found od sandy bottoms, when they are quite red. 
Lobsters are generally boiled, causing the shell to turn 
red. 

A lobster consists of body, tail, two large claws, and 
four pairs of small claws. On lower side of body, in front 
of large claws, are various small organs which surround 
the mouth, and a long and short pair of feelers. Under 
the tail are found several pairs of appendages. In the 
female lobster, also called hen lobster, is found, during 
the breeding season, the spawn, known as cored. Sex is 
determined by the pair of appendages in the tail which lie 
nearest the body ; in the female they are soft and pliable, 
in the male hard and stiff. At one time small lobsters 
were taken in such quantities that it was feared, if the 
practice was long continued, they would be exterminated. 
To protect the continuance of lobster fisheries, a law has 
been passed in many States prohibiting their sale unless 
at least ten inches long. 

Lobsters shed their shells at irregular intervals, when 
old ones are outgrown. The new ones begin to form and 
take on distinctive characteristics before the old ones are 
discarded. New shells after twenty-four hours' exposure 
to the water are quite hard. 

Lobsters, being coarse feeders (taking almost any animal 
substance attainable), are difficult of digestion, and with 
some create great gastric disturbance; notwithstanding) 
they are seldom found diseased. 

To Select a Lobster, Take in the hand, and if heavy in 
proportion to its size, the lobster is fresh. Straighten the 
tail, and if it springs into place the lobster was alive (as it 
should have been) when put into the pot for boiling. There 
is greater shrinkage in lobsters than in any other fish. 

To Open Lobsters, Take off large claws, small claws, 
and separate tail from body. Tail meat may sometimes 
be drawn out whole. with a fork; more often it is neces- 
sary to cut the thin shell portion (using scissors or a can- 
opener) in under part of the tail, then the tail meat may 
always be removed whole. Separate tail meat through 
centre, and remove the small intestinal vein which runs 



158 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

its entire length ; although generally darker than the meat, 
it is sometimes found of the same color. Hold body shell 
firmly in left hand, and with first tv/o fingers and thumb of 
right hand draw out the body, leaving in shell the stomach 
(known as the lady), which is not edible, and also some of 
the green part, the liver. The liver may be removed by 
shaking the shell. The sides of the body are covered with 
the lungs ; these are always discarded. Break body through 
the middle and separate body bones, picking out meat that 
lies between them, which is some of the sweetest and ten- 
derest to be found. Separate large claws at joints. If 
shells are thin, with a knife cut off a strip down the sharp 
edge, so that shell may be broken apart and meat removed 
whole. Where shell is thick, it must be broken with a 
mallet or hammer. Small claws are used for garnishing. 
The shell of body, tail, and lower part of large claws, if not 
broken, may be washed, dried, and used for serving of 
lobster meat after it has been prepared. The portions of 
lobsters which are not edible are lungs, stomach (lady), and 
intestinal vein. 

Crabs among Crustaceans are next in importance to lob- 
sters, commercially speaking. They are about two and one- 
half inches long by five inches wide, and are found along 
the Atlantic Coast from Massaclmsetts to Florida, and in the 
Gulf of Mexico. Crabs, like lobsters, change their shells. 
Soft-shell crabs are those which have recently shed their old 
shells, and the new shells have not had time to harden ; these 
are considered by many a great luxury. Oyster crabs (very 
small crabs found in shells with oysters) are a delicacy not 
often indulged in. Crabs are in season during the spring 
and summer. 

Shrimpa are found largely in our Southern waters, the 
largest and best coming from Lake Pontchartrain. They 
are about two inches long, covered with a thin shell, and are 
boiled and sent to market with heads removed. Their gray- 
ish color is changed to pink by boiling. Shrimps are in sear 
son from May first to October first, and are generally used 
for salads. Canned shrimps are much used and favorably 
known. 



SHELLFISH 159 

I Beptilas. Frogs and terrapin belong to a lower order of 
animals than fish, — reptiles. They are both table delica- 
cies, and are eaten by the few. 

Only the hind legs of frogs are eaten, and have much the 
same flavor as chicken. 
! Terrapin, although sold in our large cities, specially be- 
long to Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, where they 
are cooked and served at their best. Tliey are shipped from 
I the South, packed in seaweed, and may be kept for some 
I time in a dark place. Terrapin are found in both fresh and 
j salt water. The Diamond Back, salt-water terrapin, coming 
from Chesapeake Bay, are considered the best, and command 
! a very high price. Terrapin closely resembling Diamond 
I Back, coming from Texas and Florida, are principally sold 
in our markets. Terrapin are in season from November to

should always be cooked alive.

TO PREPAKS FISH FOB COOKING 

To dean a Fish. Fish are cleaned and dressed at mar- 

j ket as ordered, but need additional cleaning before cooking. 

I Remove scales which have not been taken off. This is done 

! by drawing a knife over fish, beginning at tail and working 

' towards head, occasionally wiping knife and scales from fish, 

I Incline knife slightly towards you to prevent scales from 

flying. The largest number of scales will be found on the 

flank. Wipe thorougtily inside and out with cloth wrung out 

of cold water, removing any clotted blood which may be 

I found adhering to backbone. 

I Head and tail may or may not be removed, according to 

size of fish and manner of cooking. Small fish are generally 
served with head and tail left on. 

To Skin a Pish. With sharp knife remove fins along the 
back and cut off a narrow strip of skin the entire length of 
back. Loosen skin on one side from bony part of gills, and 
i being once started, if fish is fresh, it may be readily drawn 
off; if flesh is soft do not work too quickly, as it will be 
badly torn. By allowing knife to closely follow skin this 



160 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

may be avoided. After removing skin from one side, turn 
fish and skin the other side. 

To Bone a Fish. Clean and skin before boning. Begin- 
ning at the tail, run a sharp knife under flesh close to back- 
bone, and with knife follow bone (making as clean a cut as 
possible) its entire length, thus accomplishing the removal of 
one-half the flesh ; turn, and remove flesh from other side. 
Pick out with Angers any small bones that may remain. 
Cod, haddock, halibut, and whitefish are easily and fre- 
quently boned ; flounders and smelts occasionally. 

To Fillet Fish. Clean, skin, and bone. A piece of fish, 
large or small, freed from skin and bones, is known as a 
fillet. Halibut, cut in three-fourths inch slices, is more often 
cut in fillets than any kind of fish, and fillets are frequently 
rolled. When flounder is cut in fillets it is served under the 
name of jUlet of sole. Sole found in English waters is much 
esteemed, and flounder is our nearest approach to it. 

WATS OF COOXmO FISH 

To Cook Fish in Boiling "Water. Small cod, haddock, or 
cusk are cooked whole in enough boiling water to cover, to 
which is added salt and lemon juice or vinegar. Salt gives 
flavor ; lemon juice or vinegar keeps the flesh white. A long 
fish-kettle containing a rack on which to place fish is useful 
but rather expensive. In place of fish-kettle, if the fish is 
not too large to be coiled in it, a frying-basket may be used 
placed in any kettle. 

Large fish are cut in thick pieces ior boiling, containing 
the number of pounds required. Examples: salmon and 
halibut. 

Pieces cut from large fish for boiling should be cleaned 
and tied in a piece of cheesecloth to prevent scum being 
deposited on the fish. If skin is not removed before serv- 
ing, scald the dark skin and scrape to remove coloring ; this 
may be easily accomplished by holding fish on two forks, 
and lowering into boiling water the part covered with black 
skin; then remove and scrape. Time required for boiling 
fish depends on extent of surface exposed to water. Con-

CHAPTER Xn 

BEEF 

MEAT is the name applied to the flesh of all animals 
used for food. Beef is the meat of steer, ox, or 
cow, and is the most nutritious and largely consumed of 
all animal foods. Meat is chiefly composed of the albumi- 
noids (fibrin, albumen, gelatin), fat, mineral matter, and 
water. 

Fibrin is that substance in blood which causes it to 
coagulate when shed. It consists of innumerable delicate 
fibrils which entangle the blood corpuscles, and form with 
them a mass called blood clot Fibrin is insoluble in both 
cold and hot water. * 

Albumen is a substance found in the blood and muscle. 
It is soluble in cold water, and is coagulated by hot water 
or heat. It begins to coagulate at 134^ F. and becomes 
solid at 160° F. Here lies the necessity of cooking meat 
in hot water at a low temperature; of broiling meat at a 
high temperature, to quickly sear surface. 

Gtelatin in its raw state is termed collagen. It is a 
transparent, tasteless substance, obtained by boiling with 
water, muscle, skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, ligament, or 
membrane of animals. By this process, collagen of con- 
nective tissues is dissolved and converted into gelatin. 
Gelatin is insoluble in cold water, soluble in hot water, 
but in boiling water is decomposed, and by much boiling 
will not solidify on cooling. When subjected to cold water 
it swells, and is called hydrated gelatin. Myosin is the 
albuminoid of muscle, collagen of tendons, ossein of bones, 
and chondrin of cartilage and gristle. 

Gelatin, although highly nitrogenous, does not act in the 
system as other nitrc^enous f oodS; as a large quantity passes 
out unchanged. 



192 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Fat is the white or yellowish oily solid substance forming 
the chief part of the adipose tissue. Fat is found in thick 
layers directly under the skin, in other parts of the body, in 
bone, and is intermingled throughout the flesh. Fat as 
food is a great heat-giver and force-producer. Suet is the 
name given to fat which lies about the loins and kidneys. 
Beef suet tried out and clarified is much used in cookery 
for shortening and frying. 

Mineral Matter. The largest amount of mineral matter 
is found in bone. It is principally calcium phosphate 
(phosphate of lime). Sodium chloride (common salt) is 
found in the blood and throughout the tissues. 

"Water abounds in all animals, constituting a large per- 
centage of their weight. 

The color of meat is due to the coloring matter (haemo- 
globin) which abounds in the red corpuscles of the blood. 

The distinctive flavor of meat is principally due to 
peptones and allied substances, and is intensified by the 
presence of sodium chloride and other salts. 

The beef creature is divided by splitting through the back- 
bone in two parts, each part being called a side of beef. 
Four hundred and fifty pounds is good market weight for 
a side of beef. 

The most expensive cuts come from that part of the 
creature where muscles are but little used, which makes the 
meat finer-grained and consequently more tender, taking 
less time for cooking. Many of the cheapest cuts, though 
equally nutritious, need long, slow cooking to render them 
tender enough to digest easily. Tough meat which has 
long and coarse fibres is often found to be very juicy, on 
account of the greater motion of that part of the creature, 
which causes the juices to flow freely. Roasting and broil- 
ing, which develop so fine a flavor, can only be applied to 
the more expensive cuts. The liver kidneys, and heart 
are of firm, close texture, and difficult of digestion. Tripe, 
which is the first stomach of the ox, is easy of digestion, 
but on account of the large amount of fat which it contains, 
it is undesirable for those of weak digestion. 

The quality of beef depends on age of the creatare and 



BEEF 



193 



manner of feeding. The best beef is obtained from a steer 
of four or tve years. Good beef should be firm and of 
fine-grained texture, bright red in color, and well mottled 
and coated with fat. The fat should be firm and of a yel- 
lowish color. Suet should be dry, and crumble easily. Beef 
should not be eaten as soon as killed, but allowed to hang 
and ripen, — from two to three weeks in winter, and two 
Tveeks in summer. 

Meat should be removed from paper as soon as it comes 
from market, otherwise paper absorbs some of the juices. 

Meat should be kept in a cool place. In winter, beef may 
be bought in large quantities and cut as needed. If one 
chooses, a loin or rump may be bought and kept by the 
butcher, w^ho sends cuts as ordered. 

Always wipe beef, before cooking, with a cheese-cloth 
wrung out of cold water, but never allow it to stand in a 
pan of cold water, as juices will be drawn out

The Effect of Different Temperatures on the 
Cooking of Meat 

By putting meat in cold water and allowing water to heat 
gradually, a large amount of juice is extracted and meat is 
tasteless; and by long cooking the connective tissues are 
softened and dissolved, which gives to the stock when cold a 
jelly-like coDsistency. This principle applies to soup-making. 

By putting meat in boiling water, allowing the water to 
boil for a few minutes, then lowering iA\e temperature, 
juices in the outer surface are quickly coagulated, and tUe 
inner juices are prevented from escaping. This principle 
applies where nutriment and flavor is desired in meat Ex- 
am pies : boil ed m u tton , f o w I . 

By putting in cold water, bringing quickly to the boiling 
point, then lowering the temperature and -cooking slowly 
mntiil meat is tender, some of the goodness will be in the 
stock, but a large portion left in the zneat Examples : f airl|

Broiled Beefsteak 

The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse, sirloin, 
ciOBS-cat of rump steaks, and second and third cuts from top 



196 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

ef rouDd. Porterhouse and sirloin cuts are the most expen- 
sive, on account of the great loss in bone and fat, although 
price per pound is about the same as for cross-cut of ramp. 
Round steak is very juicy, but, having coarser fibre, is not 
as tender. Steaks should be cut at least an inch thick, and 
from that to two and one-half inches. The flank end of sir- 
loin steak should be removed before cooking. It may be put 
in soup kettle, or lean part may be chopped and utilized for 
meat cakes, fat tried out and clarified for shortening. 

To BroU Steak. Wipe with a cloth wrung out of cold 
water, and trim off superfluous fat. With some of the fat 
grease a wire broiler, place meat in broiler (having fat edge 
next to handle), and broil over a clear fire, turning every 
ten seconds for the first minute, that surface may be well 
seared, thus preventing escape of juices. After the first 
minute, turn occasionally until well cooked on both sides. 
Steak cut one inch thick will take five minutes, if liked rare ; 
six minutes, if well done. Remove to hot platter, spread 
with butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.

and chopped parsley. Arrange around steak stuffed tomar 
toes, and fried potato balls served in shells made from noodle 
mixture. Pour around the following sauce : Melt two table- 
spoons butter, add two and one-half tablespoons browned 
flour, then add one cup Chicken Stock. Season with one 
tablespoon tomato catsup and salt and pepper. 

Noodle Shells. Make noodle mixture (see p. 1^7), roll as 
thinly as possible, cut in pieces, and shape over buttered 
inverted scallop shells. Put in dripping-pan and bake in a 
slow oven. As mixture bakes it curls from edges, when cases 
should be slipped from shells and pressed flrmly in insides of 
shells to finish cooking and leave an impression of shells. 
Potato balls served in these shells make an attractive garnish 
for broiled fish and meats. 

Beefsteak with Oyster Blanket 

Wipe a sirloin steak, cut one and one- half inches thick, 
broil five minutes, and remove to platter. Spread with

three fourths inches thick. Butter a plank and arrange a 
border of Duchess Potatoes close to edge, using a pastry 
bag and rose tube. Remove steak to plank, put in a hot 
oven, and bake until steak is cooked and potatoes are 
browned. Spread steak with butter, sprinkle with salt, 
pepper, and finely chopped parsley. Garnish top of steak 
with sauted mushroom caps, and put around steak at equal 
distances halves of small tomatoes sauted in butter, and oq 
top of each tomato a circular slice of cucumber.

utes. Baste every five minutes with one-fourth cup butter 
melted in one cup boiling water. Serve with Brown Mush- 
room Sauce I. 

Roaat Beef 

The best cuts of beef for roasting are : tip or middle of 
sirloin, back of rump, or first three ribs. Tip of sirloin 
roast is desirable for a small family. Back of rump makes 
a superior roast for a large family, and is more economical 
than sirloin. It is especially desirable where a large quan- 
tity of dish gravy is liked, for in carving the meat juices fol- 
low the knife. Rib roasts contain more fat than either of 
the others, and are somewhat cheaper. 

To Roast Beef. Wipe, put on a rack in dripping-pan, 
skin side down, rub over with Salt, and dredge meat and pan 
with flour. Place in hot oven, that the surface may be 
qaickly seared, thus preventing escape of inner juices. 
After flour in pan is browned, reduce heat, and baste with 
fat which has tried out ; if meat is quite lean, it may be neces- 
sary to put trimmings of fat in .pan. Baste every ten min- 
utes ; if this rule is followed, meat will be found more juicy. 
When meat is about half done, turn it over and dredge with 
flour, that skin side may be uppermost for final browning. 
For roasting, consult Time Table for Baking Meats, page 30. 

If there is danger of flour burning in pan, add a small 
quantity of water ; this, however, is not desirable, and seldom 
need be done if size of pan is adapted to size of roast. Beef 
to be well roasted should be started in hot oven and heat 
decreased, so that when carved the slices will be red through- 
out, with a crisp layer of golden brown fat on the top. 



202 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Beef roasted when temperature is so high that surface is 
hardened before heat can penetrate to the centre is most 
unsatisfactory. 

Sirloin or rib roasts may have the bones removed, and be 
rolled, skewered, and tied in shape. Chicago Butt is cut 
from the most tender part of back of rump. They are 
shipped from Chicago, our greatest beef centre, and if fresh 
and from a heavy creature^ make excellent roasts at a small 
price. 

Roast Beef Gravy. Remove some of the fat from pan, 
leaving four tablespoons. Place on front of range, add 
four tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. The 
flour, dredged and browned in pan, should give additional 
color to gravy. Add gradually one and one-half cups boil- 
ing water, cook five minutes, season with salt and pepper, 
and strain. If flour should burn in pan, gravy will be full 
of black particles. 

To Carve a Roast of Beef. Have roast placed on 
platter skin side up ; with a pointed, thin-bladed, sharp knife 
cut a sirloin or rib roast in thin slices at right angles to the 
ribs, and cut sliccvs from ribs. If there is tenderloin, remove 
it from under the bone, and cut in thin slices across grain 
of meat. Carve back of rump in thin slices with the grain of 
meat ; by so doing, some of the least tender muscle will be 
served with that which is tender. By cutting across grain 
of meat, the tenderest portion is sliced by itself, as is the 
less tender portion.

Larded FiUet of Beef 

The tenderloin of beef which lies under the loin and ramp 
is called fillet of beef. The fillet under the loin is known 
as the long fillet, and when removed no porterhouse steaks 
can be cut ; therefore it commands a higher price than the 
short fillet lying under rump. Two short fillets are often 
skewered together, and served in place of a long fillet. 

Wipe, remove fat, veins, and any tendonous portions; 
skewer in shape, and lard upper side with grain of meat, 
following directions for larding on page 23. Place on a rack 
in small pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and put in bottom of pan small pieces of pork. Bake 
twenty to thirty minutes in hot oven, basting three times. 
Take out skewer, remove meat to hot platter, and garnish 
with watercress. Serve with Mushroom, Figaro, or Horse- 
radish Sauce I. 

FiUet of Beef with Vegetables 

Wipe a three-pound fillet, trim, and remove fat. Put one- 
half pound butter in hot frying-pan and when melted add 
fillet, and turn frequently until the entire surface is seared 
and well browned; then turn occasionally until done, the 
time required being about thirty minutes. Remove to 
serving dish and garnish with one cup each cooked peas and 
carrots cut in fancy shapes, both well seasoned, one-half cup 
raisins seeded and cooked in boiling water until soft, and 
the caps from one-half pound fresh mushrooms sauted in 
butter five minutes. Serve with 

Brown Mushroom Sauce. Pour off one-fourth cup fat 
from frying-pan. add ^xe tablespoons flour, and stir until 
well browned; then add one cup Brown Soup Stock, one- 
third cup mushroom liquor, and the caps from one-half pound 
mushrooms cut in slices and sauted in butter three minutes. 
Season with salt and pepper, and just before serving add 
gradually, while stirring constantly, the butter remaining in 
frying-pan. 

To obtain mushroom liquor, scrape stems of mushrooms, 
break in pieces, cover with cold water, and ceok slowly until 
liquid is reduced to one-third cup.

with salt and pepper, dredge with flour, and brown entire 
surface in pork fat. When turning meat, avoid piercing 
with fork or skewer, which allows the inner juices to escape. 
Place on trivet in deep granite pan or in earthen pudding- 
dish, and surround with vegetables, peppercorns, and three 
cups boiling water; cover closely, and bake four hours in 
very slow oven, basting every half-hour, and turning after 
second hour. Throughout the cooking, the liquid should be 
kept below the boiling-point. Serve with Horseradish Sauce, 
or with sauce made from liquor in pan. 

Beef k la Mode 
Insei-t twelve large lardoons in a four-pound piece of beef 
cut from the round. Make incisions for lardoons by running 
through the meat a large skewer. Season with salt and pep- 
per, dredge with flour, and brown the entire surface in pork fat. 
Put on a trivet in kettle, surround with one- third cup each 
carrot, turnip, celery, and onion cut in dice, sprig of parsley, 
bit of bay leaf, and water to half cover meat. Cover closely, 
and cook slowly four hours, keeping liquor below the boiling- 
point. Remove to hot platter. Strain liquor, thicken and 
season to serve as a gravy. When beef is similarly prepared 
(with exception of lardoons and vegetables), and cooked in 
smaller amount of water, it is called Smothered Beef, or Pot 
Roast. A bean-pot (covered with a piece of buttered paper, 
tied firmly down) is the best utensil to use for a Pot Roast. 

Pressed Beef Flank 

Wipe, remove superfluous fat, and roll a flank of beef. 
Put in a kettle, cover with boiling water, and add one 
tablespoon salt, one-half teaspoon peppercorns, a bit of bay 
leaf, and a bone or two which may be at hand. Cook 
alowly until meat is in shreds; there should be but little 



BBEF 205 

liqnor in kettle when meat is done. Arrange meat in a deep 
pan, pour over liquor, cover, and press with a heavy weight. 
Serve cold, thinly sliced.

Carrot \ half-inch cubes Pepper 

Wipe meat, remove from boue, cut in one and one-half 
inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dredge with 
flour. Cut some of the fat in small pieces and try out in 
frying-pan. Add meat and stir constantly, that the surface 
may be quickly seared; when well browned, put in kettle, 
and rinse frying-pan with boiling water, that none of the 
goodness may be lost. Add to meat remaining fat, and 
bone sawed in pieces ; cover with boiling water and boil five 
minutes, then cook at a lower temperature until meat is ten- 
der (time required being about three hours). Add carrot, 
turnip, and onion, with salt and pepper the last hour of 
cooking. Parboil potatoes five minutes, and add to stew 
fifteen minutes before taking from fire. Remove bones, 
large pieces of fat, and then skim. Thicken with one- 
fourth cup flour, diluted with enough cold water to pour 
easily. Pour in deep hot platter, and surround with dump- 
lings. Remnants of roast beef are usually made into a beef 
stew ; the meat having been once cooked, there is no neces- 
sity of browning it If gravy is left, it should be added to 
the stew. 

DumplingB 
2 cups flour }^ teaspoon salt

Mix and sift dry ingredients. Work in butter with tips of 
fingers, and add milk gradually, using a knife for mixing. 
Toss on a floured board, pat, and roll out to one-half inch in 
thickness. Shape with biscuit-cutter, first dipped in flour. 
Place closely together in a buttered steamer, put over kettle of 
boiling water, cover closely, and steam twelve minutes. A 



206 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

perforated tin pie-plate may be osed in place of steamer. A 
little more milk may be used in the mixture, when it may be 
taken up by spoonfuls, dropped and cooked on top of stew. 
In this case some of the liquid must be removed, that dumpy- 
lings may rest on meat and potato, and not settle into 
liquid. 

Corned Beef 

Corned beef has but little nutritive value. It is used to 
give variety to our diet in summer, when fresh meats prove 
too stimulating. It is eaten by the workingmau to give 
bulk to his food. The best pieces of corned beef are the 
rattle rand and fancy brisket. The fancy brisket com- 
mands a higher price and may be easily told from the rattle 
rand by the selvage on lower side and the absence of bones. 
The upper end of brisket (butt end) is thick and composed 
mostly of lean meat, the middle cut has more fat but is not 
well mixed, while the lower (navel end) has a large quantity 
of fat. The rattle rand contains a thick lean end; the 
second cut contains three distinct layers of meat and fat, 
and is considered the best cut by those who prefer meat 
well streaked with fat. The rattle rand has a thin end, 
which contains but one layer of lean meat and much fat, 
consequently is not a desirable piece. 

To Boil Corned Beef. Wipe the meat and tie securely in 
shape, if this has not been already done at market Put 
in kettle, cover with cold water, and bring slowly to boiling- 
point Boil five minutes, remove scum, and cook at a lower 
temperature until tender. Cool slightly in water in which it 
was cooked, remove to a dish, cover, and place on cover a 
weight, that meat may be well pressed. The lean meat and 
fat may be separated and put in alternate layers in a 
bread pan, then covered and pressed. 

Boiled Dinner 

A boiled dinner consists of warm unpreased oomed beef, 
served with cabbage, beets, turnips, carrots, and potatoes. 
After removing meat from water, skim off fat and oook 
vegetables (with exception of beets, which require a long 



BEBF 207 

time for cooking) in this water. Carrots require a longer 
time for cooking than cabbage or turnips. Carrots and 
turnips, if small, may be cooked whole ; if large, cut in 
pieces. Cabbage and beets are served in separate dishes, 
other vegetables on same dish with meat. 

Boiled Tong;ae 
A boiled corned tongue is cooked the same as Boiled 
Corned Beef. If very salt, it should be soaked in cold 
water several hours, or over night, before cooking. Take 
from water when slightly cooled and remove skin. 

Braised Tone:ue 

A fresh tongue is necessary for braising. Put tongue 
in kettle, cover with boiling water, and cook slowly two 
hours. Take tongue from water and remove skin and roots. 
Place in deep pan and surround with one-third cup each 
carrot, onion, and celery, cut in dice, and one sprig parsley ; 
then pour over four cups sauce. Cover closely, and bake 
two hours, turning after the first hour. Serve on platter 
and strain around the sauce. 

Sauce for Tongue. Brown one-fourth cup butter, add 
one-fourth cup flour and stir together until well browned. 
Add gradually four cups of water in which tongue was 
cooked. Season with salt and pepper and add one teaspoon 
Worcestershire Sauce. One and one-half cups stewed and 
strained tomatoes may be used in place of some of the 
water.

CHAPTER XIII 
LAMB AST) MTJTTOir 

LAMB is the name given to the meat of lambs ; mutton, 
to the meat of sheep. Lamb, coming as it does from 
the young creature, is immature, and less nutritious than 
mutton. The flesh of mutton ranks with the flesh of beef in 
nutritive value and digestibility. The fat of mutton, on ac- 
count of its larger percentage of stearic acid, is more difficult 
of digestion than the fat of beef. 

Lamb may be eaten soon after the animal is killed and 
dressed ; mutton must hang to ripen. Good mutton comes 
from a sheep about three years old, and should hang from 
two to three weeks. The English South Down Mutton is cut 
from creatures even older than three years. Young lamb, 
when killed from six weeks to three months old, is called 
spring lamb, and appears in the market as early as the last 
of January, but is very scarce until March. Lamb one year 
old is called a yearling. Many object to the strong flavor of 
mutton ; this is greatly overcome by removing the pink skin 
and trimming off superfluous fat. 

Lamb and mutton are divided into two parts by cutting 
through entire length of backbone; then subdivided into 
fore and hind quarter, eight ribs being left on hind quarter, 
— while in beef but three ribs are left on hind-quarter. 
These eight ribs are cut into chops and are known as rib 
chops. The meat which lies between these ribs and the leg, 
cut into chops, is known as loifi or kidney chops. 

Lamb and mutton chops cut from loin have a small piece 
of tenderloin on one side of bone, and correspond to porter- 
house steaks in the beef creature. Rib chops which have the 



ULMB AND MUTTON 215 

bone cut short and scraped clean, nearly to the lean meat, 
are called French chops. 

Hie leg is sold whole for boiling or roasting. The fore- 
quarter raay be boned, stuffed, rolled, and roasted, but is 
more often used for broth, stew, or fricassee. 

For a saddle of mutton the loin is removed whole before 
splitting the creature. Some of the bones are removed and 
the flank ends are rolled, fastened with wooden skewers, 
and securely tied to keep skewers in place. 

Good quality mutton should be fine-grained and of bright 
pink color ; the fat white, hard, and flaky. If the outside 
skin comes off easily, mutton is sure to be good. Lamb 
chops may be easily distinguished from mutton chops by the 
red color of bone. As lamb grows older, blood recedes 
from bones ; therefore in mutton the bone is white. In leg 
of lamb the bone at joint is serrated, while in leg of mutton 
the bone at joint is smooth and rounded. Good mutton 
contains a larger proportion of fat than good beef. Poor 
mutton is often told by the relatively small proportion of 
fat and lean as compared to bone. 

Lamb is usually preferred well done; mutton is often 
cooked rare. 

Broiled Lamb or Mutton Chops 
Wipe chops, remove superfluous fat, and place in a broiler 
greased with some of mutton fat. In loin chops, flank may 
be rolled and fastened with a small wooden skewer. Follow 
directions for Broiling Beefsteak on page 196. 

Pan-broiled Chopa 

Chops for pan broiling should have flank and most of fat 
removed. Wipe chops and put in hissing hot frying-pan. 

Turn as soon as under surface is seared, and sear other 
side. Turn often, using knife and fork that the surface 
may not be pierced, as would be liable if fork alone were 
used. Cook six minutes if liked rare, eight to ten minutes 
if liked well done. Let stand around edge of frying-pan to 
brown the outside fat. When half cooked, sprinkle witn 
salt Drain on brown paper, put on hot platter, and spread 
with butter or serve with Tomato or Soubise Sauoe. 



216 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Breaded Mutton Chops 
Wipe and trim chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip 
in crumbs, egg, and crumbs, fry in deep fat from five to 
eight minutes, and drain. Serve with Tomato Sauce, or 
stack around a mound of mashed potatoes, fried potato 
balls, or green peas. Never fry but four at a time, and 
allow fat to reheat between fryings. After testing fat for 
temperature, put in chops and place kettle on back of range, 
that surface of chops may not be too brown while the inside 
is still underdone. ' 

Chops d la Slgnora 

Gash French Chops on outer edge, extending cut half- 
way through lean meat. Insert in each gash a slice of 
truffle, sprinkle with salt and pepper, wrap in calfs caul. 
Roll in flour, dip in egg, then in stale bread crumbs, and 
saut3 in butter eight minutes, turning often. Place in oven 
four minutes to finish cooking. Arrange on hot platter for 
serving, and place on top of each a fresh broiled mushroom 
or mushroom baked in cream. To fat in pan add a small 
quantity of boiling water and pour around chops. This is a 
delicious way of cooking chops for a dinner party.

Roast Lamb 

A leg of lamb is usually sent from market wrapped in caul ; 
remove caul, wipe meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place 
on rack in dripping-pan, and dredge meat and bottom of 
pan with flour. Place in hot oven, and baste as soon as 
flour in pan is brown, and every fifteen minutes afterwards 
until meat is done, which will take about one and three- 
fourths hours. It may be necessary to put a small quantity 
of water in pan while meat is cooking. Leg of lamb may be 
boned and stuffed for roasting. See StuflSng, under Braised 
Mutton.

CHAPTER XIV 
VEAL 

VEAL is the meat obtained from a jouDg calf killed 
when six to eight weeks old. Veal from a yoanger 
animal is very unwholesome, and ia liable to provoke serioos 
gastric disturbances. Veal contains a much smaller per- 
centage of fat than beef or mutton, is less nutritious, and 
(though from a young creature) more difficult of digestion. 
Like lamb, it is not improved by long hanging, but should 
be eaten soon after killing and dressing. It should always 
be remembered that the flesh of young animals does not keep 
fresh as long as that of older ones. Veal is divided in same 
manner as lamb, into fore and hind quarters. The fore- 
quarjer is subdivided into breast, shoulder, and neck ; the 
hind-quarter into loin, leg, and knuckle. Cutlets, fillets 
(cushion), and fricandeau are cut from the thick part of 
leg. 

Good veal may be known by its pinkish-colored flesh and 
white fat ; when the flesh lacks color, it has been taken from 
a creature which was too young to kill for food, or, if of the 
right age, was bled before killing. Veal may be obtained 
throughout the year, but is in season during the spring. 
Veal should be thoroughly cooked; being deficient in fat 
and having but little flavor, pork or butter should be added 
while cooking, and more seasoning is required than for 
other meats. 

Veal Cutlets 

Use slices of veal from leg cut one-half inch thick. Wipe, 

remove bone and skin, then cut in pieces for serving. The 

long, irregular-shaped pieces may be rolled, and fastened 

with small wooden skewers. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; 



YBAL 227 

dip in flonr, egg, and cruq^bs ; fry slowly, until well browned, 
in salt pork fat or butter ; then remove cutlets to stewpan 
and pour over one and one-half cups Brown Sauce. Place 
on back of range and cook slowly forty minutes, or until 
cutlets are tender. 

Veal may be cooked first iu boiling water until tender, 
then crumbed and fried. The water in which veal was 
cooked may be used for sauce. Arrange on hot platter, 
strain sauce and pour around cutlets, and garnish with 
parsley. 

Brown Sance. Brown three tablespoons butter, add three 
tablespoons flour, and stir until well browned. Add gradu- 
ally one and one-half cups stock or water, or half stock and 
half stewed and strained tomatoes. Season with salt, pep- 
per, lemon juice, and Worcestershire Sauce. The trimmings 
from veal (including skin and bones) may be covered with 
one and one-half cups cold water, allowed to heat slowly to 
boiling-point, then cooked, strained, and used for sauce. 

Veal Chops Bavarian 

Wipe six loin chops and put in a stewpan with one-half 
onion, eight slices carrot, two stalks celery, one-half tea- 
spoon peppercorns, four cloves, and two tablespoons butter. 
Cover with boiling water and cook until tender. Drain, 
season with salt and pepper, dip in flonr, egg, and crumbs, 
fry in deep fat, and drain on brown paper. Arrange chops 
on hot serving dish and surround with boiled flat maccaroni 
to which Soubise Sauce (see p. 267) is added. 

Fricassee of Veal 

Wipe two pounds sliced veal, cut from loin, and cover 
with boiling water ; add one small onion, two stalks celery, 
and six slices carrot. Cook slowly until meat is tender. 
Remove meat, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour, and saut^ in pork fat. Strain liquor (there should be 
two cups). Melt four tablespoons butter, add four table- 
spoons flour and strained liquor. Bring to boiling-point, 
season with salt and pepper, and pour around meat. Gar- 
nish with parsley.

CHAPTER XV 
" SWEETBREADS 

A SWEETBREAD is the thymus gland of lamb or calf, 
but in cookery, veal sweetbreads only are consid- 
ered. It is prenatally developed, of unknown function, and 
as soon as calf is taken from liquid food it gradually dis- 
appears. Pancreas, stomach sweetbread, is sold in some 
sections of the country, but in our markets this custom is 
not practised. Sweetbreads are a reputed table delicacy, 
and a valuable addition to the menu of the convalescent. 

A sweetbread consists or' two parts, connected by tubing 
and membranes. The round, compact part is called the 
heart sweetbread, as its position is nearer the heart; the 
other part is called the throat sweetbread. When sweet- 
bread is found in market separated, avoid buying two of 
the throat sweetbreads, as the heart sweetbread is more 
desirable. 

Sweetbreads spoil very quickly. They should be re- 
moved from paper as soon as received from market, 
plunged into cold water and allowed to stand one hour, 
drained, and put into acidulated salted boiling water 
then allowed to cook slowly twenty minutes ; again drained, 
and plunged into cold water, that they may be kept white 
and firm. Sweetbreads are always parboiled in this manner 
for subsequent cooking.

CHAPTER XVI 
FOBE 

PORK is the ilesh and fat of pig or hog. Different 
parts of the creature, when dressed, take different 
names. 

The chine and spareribs, which correspond to the loin in 
lamb and veal, are used for roasts or steaks. Two ribs are 
left on the chine. The hind legs furnish hams. These are 
cured, salted, and smoked. Sugar-cured hams are considered 
the best. Pickle, to which is added light brown sugar, 
molasses, and saltpetre, is introduced close to bone ; hams 
are allowed to hang one week, then smoked with hickory 
wood. Shoulders are usually corned, or salted and smoked, 
though sometimes cooked fresh. Pigs' feet are boiled until 
tender, split, and covered with vinegar made from white 
wine. Hocks, the part just above the feet, are corned, and 
much used by Oermans. Heads are soused, and cooked 
by boiling. The flank, which lies just below the ribs, is 
salted and smoked, and furnishes bacon. The best pieces of 
fat salt pork come from the back, on either side of backbone. 

Fat, when separated from flesh and membrane, is tried 
out and called lard. Leaf-lard is the best, and is tried out 
from the leaf shaped pieces of solid fat which lie inside the 
flank. Sansages are trimmings of lean and fat meat^ minced, 
highly seasoned, and forced into thin casings made of the 
prepared entrails. Little pigs (four weeks old) are some- 
times killed, dressed, and roasted whole. 

Pork contains the largest percentage of fat of any meat.

although found in market through the entire year, it should 
be but seldom served, and then only during the winter months. 
By curing, salting, and smoking, pork is rendered more whole- 
some. jBocon, next to butter and cream, is the most easily 
assimilated of all fatty foods. 

Pork Chops 
Wipe chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place in a hot 
frying-pan, and cook slowly until tender, and well browned 
on each side. 

Pork Chops with Fried Apples 
Arrange Pork Chops on a platter, and surround with 
slices of apples, cut one-half inch thick, fried in the fat 
remaining in pan. 

Roast Pork 
Wipe pork, sprinkle with salt and pepper, place on a rack 
m a dripping-pan, and dredge meat and botton of pan with 
flour. Bake in a moderate oven three or four hours, basting 
every fifteen minutes with fat in pan. Make a gravy as for 
other roasts. 

Pork Tenderloins with Sweet Potatoes 
Wipe tenderloins, put in a dripping-pan, and brown quickly 

in a hot oven ; then sprinkle with salt and pepper, and bake 

forty-five minutes, basting every fifteen minutes. 

Sweet Potatoes. Pare six potatx>es and parboil ten 

minutes, drain, put in pan with meat, and cook until soft, 

basting when basting meat. 

Breakfast Bacon 
See Liver and Bacon, page 207. 

Fried Salt Pork with Codfish 
Cut fat salt pork in one-fourth inch slices, cut gashes one- 
third inch apart in slices, nearly to rind. Try out in a hot 
frying-pan until brown and crisp, occasionally turning off 
fat from pan. Serve around strips of codfish which have 
been soaked in pan of lukewarm water and allowed to stand 
on back of range until soft. Serve with Drawn Butter Sauce, 
boiled potatoes, and beets.

Broiled Ham 
Soak thin slices of ham one hour in lukewarm water. 
Drain, wipe, and broil three minutes. 

Fried Ham and Eggs 

Wipe ham, remove one-half outside layer of fat, and place 

in frying-pan. Cover with tepid water and let stand on back 

of range thii*ty minutes ; drain, and dry on a towel. Heat 

pan, put in ham, brown quickly on one side, turn and brown 

other side; or soak ham over night, dry, and cook in hot 

I frying-pan. If cooked too long, ham will become hard and 

I dry. Serve with fried eggs cooked in the tried-out ham 

fat. 

Barbecned Ham 

Soak thin slices of ham one hour in lukewarm water; 
drain, wipe, and cook in a hot frying-pan until slightly 
browned. Remove to serving dish and add to fat in pan 
three tablespoons vinegar mixed with one and one-half tea- 
spoons mustard, one-half teaspoon sugar, and one-eighth 
teaspoon paprika. When thoroughly heated pour over ham 
and serve at once. 

Boiled Ham 
Soak several hours or over night in cold water to cover. 
Wash thoroughly, trim off hard skin near end of bone, put 
in a kettle, cov^r with cold water, heat to boiling-point, and 
cook slowly until tender. See Time Table for Cooking, 
page 28. Remove kettle from range and set aside, that ham 
may partially cool ; then take from water, remove outside 
skin, sprinkle with sugar and fine cracker crumbs, and stick 
with cloves one-half inch apart. Bake one hour in a slow 
oven. Serve cold, thinly sliced. 

Roast Ham "with Champagne Sauce 

Place a whole baked ham in the oven fifteen minutes 
before serving time, that outside fat may be heated. Re- 
move to a hot platter, garnish bone end with a paper rufile^ 
and serve with Champagne Sauce. 



238 BOSTON COOKINQ-SOHOOL COOK BOOK 

'Westphalian Ham 
These bams are imported from Germany, and need no 
additional cooking. Cut in very thin slices for serving. 

Broiled Pigs' Feet 

Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and broil six to 
eight minutes. Serve with Maltre d'Hdtel Butter or Sauce 
Piquante. 

Fried Figs' Feet 

Wipe, sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in crumbs, egg, 
and crumbs, fry in deep fat, and drain. 

Sausages 

Cut apart a string of sausages. Pierce each sausage 
several times with a carving fork. Put in frying-pan, cover 
with boiling water, and cook fifteen minutes ; drain, return 
to frying-pan, and fry until well ])rowned. Serve with fried 
apples. Sausages are often broiled same as bacon and 
apples baked in pan under them. 

Boston Baked Beans 

Pick over one quart pea beans, cover with cold water, 
and soak over night. In morning, drain, cover with fresh 
water, heat slowly (keeping water below boiling-point), and 
cook until skins will burst, — which is best determined by 
taking a few beans on the tip of a spoon and blowing on 
them, when skins will burst if sufficiently cooked. Beans 
thus tested must, of course, be thrown away. Drain beansi 
throwing bean-water out of doors, not in sink. Scald rind of 
three-fourths pound fat salt pork, scrape, remove one- fourth 
inch slice and put in bottom of bean-pot. Cut through rind 
of remaining pork every one-half inch, making cuts one inch 
deep. Put beans in pot and bury pork in beans, leaving 
rind exposed. Mix one tablespoon salt, one tablespoon 
molasseo, and three tablespoons sugar; add one cup boiling 
water, and pour over beans ; then add enough more boiling 
water to cover beans. Cover bean-pot, put in oven, and 
bake slowly six or eight hours, uncovering the last hour of 



POBK 289 

cooking, that rind may become brown and crisp. Add 
water as needed. Many feel sure that by adding with sea- 
sonings one-half tablespoon mustard, the beans are more 
easily digested. If pork mixed with lean is preferred, use 
less salt 

The fine reputation which Boston Baked Beans have 
gained has been attributed to the earthen bean-pot with 
small top and bulging sides in which they are supposed to 
be cooked. Equally good beans have often been eaten 
where a five-pound lard pail was substituted for the broken 
bean-pot. 

Yellow-eyed beans are very good when baked.

CHAPTER XVII 

POIJLTBT AND GAME 

POULTRY includes all domestic birds suitable for food 
except pigeon and squab. Examples: chicken, fowl, 
turkey, duck, goose, etc. Game includes such birds and 
animals suitable for food as are pursued and taken in field 
and forest. Examples : quail, partridge, wild duck, plover, 
deer, etc. 

The flesh of chicken, fowl, and turkey has much shorter 
fibre than that of ruminating animals, and is not inter- 
mingled with fat, — the fat always being found in layers 
directly under the skin, and surrounding the intestines. 
Chicken, fowl, and turkey are nutritious, and chicken is 
specially easy of digestion. The white meat found on breast 
and wing is more readily digested than the dark meat. The 
legs, on account of constant motion, are of a coarser fibre 
and darker color. 

Since incubators have been so much used for hatching 
chickens, small birds suitable for broiling may be always 
found in market. Chickens which appear in market during 
January weighing about one and one-half pounds are called 
spring chickens. 

Fowl is found in market throughout the year, but is at its 
best from March until June. 

Philadelphia, until recently, furnished our market with 
Philadelphia chickens and capons^ but now Massachusctte 
furnishes equally good ones, which are found in market from 
December to June. They are very large, plump, and supe- 
rior eating. At an early age they are deprived of the organs 
of reproduction, penned, and specially fatted for killing. 



POTJLTRY AND GAME 241 

They are recognized by the presence of head, tail^ and wing 
feathers. 

Turkeys are foand in market throughout the year, but are 
best during the winter months. Tame ducks and geese are 
very indigestible on account of the large quantity of fat 
they contain. Groose meat is thoroughly infiltrated with fat, 
containing sometimes forty to forty-five per cent. Pigeons, 
being old birds, need long, slow cooking to make them ten- 
der. Squabs (young pigeons) make a delicious tidbit for 
the convalescent, and are often the first meat allowed a 
patient by the physician. 

The flesh of game, with the exception of wild duck and 
wild geese, is tender, contains less fat than poultry, is of 
fine though strong flavor, and easy of digestion. Game 
meat is usually of dark color, partridge and quail being ex- 
ceptions, and is usually cooked rare. Venison, the flesh of 
deer, is short-fibred, dark-colored, highly savored, tender, 
and easy of digestion ; being highly savored, it often dis- 
agrees with those of weak digestion. 

Geese are in market throughout the year, Massachusetts 
and Rhode Island furnishing specially good ones. A goose 
twelve weeks old is known as a green goose. They may be 
found in market from May to September. Young geese 
which appear in market September first and continue through 
December are called goslings. They have been hatched 
during May and June, and then fatted for market. 

Young ducks, found in market about March first, are 
called ducklings. Canvasback Ducks have gained a fine 
reputation throughout the country, and are found in mar- 
ket from the last of November until March. Redhead 
Ducks are in season two weeks earlier, and are about as 
good eating as Canvasback Ducks, and much less in price. 
The distinctive flavor of both is due to the wild celery on 
which they feed. Many other kinds of ducks are found in 
market during the fall and winter. Examples: Widgeon, 
Mallard, Lake Erie Teal, Black Ducks, and Butterballs. 

Fresh quail are in market from October fifteenth to Janu- 
ary first, the law forbidding their being killed at any other 
time in .the year. The same is true of partridge, but both 



242 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

are frozen and kept in cold storage several months. Cali- 
fornia sends frozen quail in large numbers to Eastern mar- 
kets. Grouse (prairie chicken) are always obtainable, — 
fresh ones in the fall ; later, those kept in cold storage. 
Plover may be bought from April until December. 

To Select Poultry and Gkime. A chicken is known by 
soft feet, smooth skin, and soft cartilage at end of breast- 
bone. An abundance of pinfeatbers always indicates a 
young bird, while the presence of long hairs denotes age. 1 n 
a fowl the feet have become harci and dry with coarse scales, 
and cartilage at end of breastbone has ossified. Cock turkeys 
arc usually better eating than hen turkeys, unless hen turkey 
is young, small, and plump. A good turkey should be 
plump, have smooth dark legs, and cartilage at end of breast- 
bone soft and pliable. Good geese abound in pinfeathers. 
Small birds should be plump, have soft feet and pliable bills. 

To Dress and Clean Poultry. Remove hairs and down 
by holding the bird over a flame (from gas, alcohol, or burn- 
ing paper) and constantly changing position until all parts 
of surface have been exposed to flame; this is known as 
singeing. Cut off the head and draw out pinfeathers, using 
a small pointed knife. Cut through the skin around the leg 
one and one-half inches below the leg joint, care being taken 
not to cut tendons ; place leg at this cut over edge of board, 
press downward to snap the bone, then take foot in right 
hand, holding bird firmly in left hand, and pull off foot, and 
with it the tendons. In old birds the tendons must be drawn 
separately, which is best accomplished by using a steel 
skewer. Make an incision through skin below breastbone, 
just large enough to admit the hand. With the hand remove 
entrails, gizzard, heart, and liver ; the last three named con- 
stitute what is known as giblets. The gall bladder, lying on 
the under surface of the right lobe of the liver, is removed 
with liver, and great care must be taken that it is not broken, 
as a small quantity of the bile which it contains would im- 
part a bitter flavor to the parts with which it came in contact. 
Enclosed by the ribs, on either side of backbone, may be 
found the lungs, of spongy consistency and red color. Care 
must be taken that every part of them is removed. Kidneys. 



POULTRY AND GAME 243 

lying in the hollow near end of backbone, must also be re- 
moved. By introducing first two fingers under skin close to 
neck, the windpipe may be easily found and withdrawn ; also 
the crop, which will he found adhering to skin close to breast 
Draw down neck skin, and cut off neck close to body, leav- 
ing skin long enough to fasten under the back. Remove oil 
bag, and wash bird by allowing cold water to run through it, 
not allowing bird to soak in cold water. Wipe inside and 
outside, looking carefully to see that everything has been 
withdrawn. If there is disagreeable odor, suggesting that 
fowl may have been kept too long, clean at once, wash inside 
and out with soda water, and sprinkle inside with charcoal 
and place some under wings. 

Poultry dressed at market seldom have tendons removed 
unless so ordered. ' It is always desirable to have them with- 
drawn, as they become hard and bony during cooking. It is 
the practice of market- men to cut a gash through the skin, 
to easier reach crop and windpipe. This gash must be sewed 
before stufi9ng, find causes the bird to look less attractive 
when cooked. 

To Cut up a Fowl. Singe, draw out pinfeathers, cut off 
head, remove tendons and oil bag. Cut through skin be- 
tween leg and body close to body, bend back leg (thus break- 
ing ligaments), cut through flesh, and separate at joint. 
Separate the upper part of leg, second Joints from lower part 
of leg, drumstick, as leg is separated from body. Remove 
wing by cutting through skin and flesh around upper wing 
joint which lies next to body, then disjoint from body. Cut 
off tip of wing and separate wing at middle joint. Remove 
leg and wing from other side. Separate breast from back 
by cutting through skin, beginning two inches below breast- 
bone and passing knife between terminus of small ribs on 
either side and extending cut to collar-bone. Before removing 
entrails, gizzard, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, crop, and wind- 
pipe, observe their position, that the anatomy of the bird may 
be understood. The back is sometimes divided by cutting 
through the middle crosswise. The wishbone, with adjoin- 
ing meat, is frequently removed, and the breast meat may 
be separated in two parts by cutting through flesh close to 



244 BOSTOK COOKlK(J-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

breastbone with cleaver. Wipe pieces, excepting back, with 
cheese-cloth wrung out of cold water. Back piece needs thor- 
ough washing. 

To Clean Giblets. Remove thin membrane, arteries, veins, 
and clotted blood around heart. Separate gall bladder from 
liver, cutting off any of liver that may have a greenish tinge. 
Cut fat and membranes from gizzard. Make a gash through 
thickest part of gizzard, and cut as far as inner lining, being 
careful not to pierce it Remove the inner sack and discard. 
Wash giblets and cook until tender, with neck and tips of 
wings, putting them in cold water and heating water quickly 
that some of thd flavor may be drawn out into stock, which 
is to be used for making gravy. 

To Stuff Poultry. Put stuffing by spoonfuls in neck end, 
using enough to sufficiently fill the skin, that bird may look 
plump when served. Where cracker stuffing is used, allow- 
ance must be made for the swelling of crackers, otherwise 
skin may burst during cooking. Put remaining stuffing in 
body; if the body is full, sew skin; if not full, bring skin 
together with a skewer. 

To Truss Fowl. Draw thighs close to body and hold by 
inserting a steel skewer under middle joint running it 
through body, coming out under middle joint on other side- 
Cut piece three-fourths inch wide from neck skin, and with 
it fasten legs together at ends; or cross drumsticks, tie 
securely witb a long string, and fasten to tail. Place wings 
close to body and hold them by inserting a second skewer 
through wing, body, and wing on opposite side. Draw neck 
skin under back and fasten with a small wooden skewer. 
Turn bird on its breast. Cross string attached to tail piece 
and draw it around each end of lower skewer ; again cross 
string and draw around each end of upper skewer; fasten 
string in a knot and cut off ends. In birds that are not 
stuffed legs are often passed through incisions cut in body 
under bones near tail. 

To Dress Birds for Broiling. Singe, wipe, and with a 
sharp-pointed knife, beginning at back of neck, make a cut 
through backbone the entire length of bird. Lay open the 
bird and remove contents from inside. Cut out rib bones 



POULTRY AND 6AMB 245 

on either side of backbone, remove from breastbone, then 
cut through tendons at joints. 

To Fillet a Chicken. Remove skin from breast, and with 
a small sharp knife begin at end of collar-bone and cut 
through flesh, following close to wish and breast bones the 
entire length of meat. Raise flesh with fingers, and with 
knife free the piece of meat from bones which lie under it. 
Cut meat away from wing joint ; this solid piece of breast is 
meat known as bl fillet. This meat is easily separated in two 
parts. The upper, larger part is Called the large fillet; the 
lower part the mignonfiUet, The tough skin on the outside 
of large fillet should be removed, also the sinew from mignon 
fillet. To remove tough skin, place large fillet on a board, 
upper side down, make an incision through flesh at top of 
fillet, and cut entire length of fillet, holding knife as close to 
skin as possible. Trim edges, that fillet may look shapely. 

Broiled Chicken 

Dress for broiling, following directions on page 244. 
Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and place in a well-greased 
broiler. Broil twenty minutes over a clear fire, watching 
carefully and turning broiler so that all parts may be equally 
browned. The flesh side must be exposed to the fire the 
greater part of time, as the skin side will brown quickly. 
Remove to a hot platter, spread with soft butter, and 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Chickens are so apt to burn 
while broiling that many prefer to partially cook in oven. 
Place chicken in dripping-pan, skin side down, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, dot over with butter, and bake fifteen min- 
utes in hot oven; then broil to finish cooking. Guinea 
chickens are becoming popular cooked in this way. 

Boiled Fowl 
Dress, deaif, and truss a four-pound fowl, tie in cheese- 
cloth, place on trivet in a kettle, half surround with boiling 
water, cover, and cook slowly until tender, turning occa- 
sionally. Add salt the last hour of cooking. Serve with 
Egg, Oyster, or Celery Sauce. It is not desirable to stuff 
a boiled fowl.

RoBBt Chicken 
Dress, clean, stuff, and truss a chicken. Place on its back 
on rack in a dripping pan. rub entire surface with salt, and 
spread breast and legs with three tablespoons butter, rubbed 
until creamy and mixed with two tablespoons flour. Dredge 
bottom of pan with flour. Place in a hot oven, and when 
flour is well browned, reduce the heat, then baste. Continue 
basting every ten minutes until chicken is cooked. For 
basting, use one-fourth cup butter, melted in two- thirds cup 
boiling water, and after this is gone, use fat in pan, and 
when necessary to prevent flour burning, add one cup boiling 
water. During cooking, turn chicken frequently', that it 
may brown evenly. If a thick crust is desired, dredge bird 
with flour two or three times during cooking. I^ a glazed 
surface is preferred, spread bird with butter, omitting flour, 
and do not dredge during baking. When breast meat is 
tender, bird is suflSciently cooked. A four-pound chicken 
requires about one and one-half hours.

pan, rub entire surface with salt, and spread breast, legs, 
and wings with one-third cup butter, rubbed until creamy 
and mixed with one-fourth cup flour. Dredge bottom of pan 
with flour. Place in a hot oven, and when flour on turkey 
begins to brown, reduce heat, and baste every fifteen minutes 
until turkey is cooked, which will require about three hours. 
For basting use one-half cup butter melted in one-half cup 
boiling water and after this is used baste with fat in pan. 
Pour water in pan during the cooking as needed to prevent 
flour from burning. During cooking turn turkey frequently, 
that it may brown evenly. If turkey is browning too fast, 
cover with buttered paper to prevent burning. Remove 
string and skewers before serving. Garnish with parsley, 
or celery tips, or curled celery and rings and discs of carrots 
strung on fine wire. 

For stuffing, use double the quantities given in recipes 
under Roast Chicken. If stuffing is to be served cold, 
add one beaten egg. Turkey is often roasted with Chestnut

To Truss a Ooose 

A goose, having short legs, is trussed differently from 
chicken, fowl, and turkey. After inserting skewers, wind 
string twice around one leg bone, then around other leg 
bone, having one inch space of string between legs. Draw 
legs with both ends of string close to back, cross string 
under back, then fasten around skewers and tie in a knot. 

Roast Wild Duck 

Dress and clean a wild duck and truss as goose. Place on 
rack in dripping-pan, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and

twenty to thirty minutes in a very hot oven, basting every 
five minutes with fat in pan ; cut string and remove string 
and skewers. Serve with Orange or Olive Sauce. Currant 
jelly should accompany a duck course. Domestic ducks 
should always be well cooked, requiring little more than twice 
the time allowed for wild ducks. 

Ducks are sometimes stuffed with apples, pared, cored, 
and cut in quarters, or three small onions may be put in body 
of duck to improve flavor. Neither apples nor onions are to 
be served. If a stuffing to be eaten is desired, cover pieces 
of dry bread with boiling water; as soon as bread has 
absorbed water, press out the water ; season bread with salt, 
pepper, melted butter, finely chopped onion, or use

FISH AND MEAT SAUCES 266 



CHAPTER XVIII 
FISH AKD MEAT SAVCES 

THE French chef keeps always on hand four sauces, — 
White, Brown, Bechamel, and Tomato, — and with 
these as a basis is able to make kinds innumerable. Butter 
and flour are usually cooked together for thickening sauces. 
When not browned, it is called roux; when browned, brovu^n 
roux. The French mix butter and flour together, put in 
saucepan, place over fire, stir for five minutes ; set aside to 
cool, again place over fire, and add liquid, stirring constantly 
until thick and smooth. Butter and flour for brown sauces 
are cooked together much longer, and watched carefully lest 
butter should burn. The American cook makes sauce by 
stirring butter in saucepan until melted and bubbling, adds 
flour and continues stirring, then adds liquid, gradually stir- 
ring or beating until the boiling-point is reached. For Brown 
Sauce, butter should be stirred until well browned; flour 
should be added and stirred with butter until both are 
browned before the addition of liquid. The secret in mak- 
ing a Brown Sauce is to have butter and flour well browned 
before adding liquid. 

It is well worth remembering that a sauce of average 
thickness is made by allowing two tablespoons each of butter 
and flour to one cup liquid, whether it be milk, stock, or to- 
mato. For Brown Sauce a slightly larger quantity of flour 
is necessary, as by browning flour its thickening property is 
lessened, its starch being changed to dextrine. When sauces 
are set away, put a few bits of butter on top to prevent crust 
from forming.

W, 0. Atwaler, Ph.D, 



Vegetables include, commonly though not botanically 
speaking, all plants used for food except grains and fruits. 
With exception of beans, peas, and lentils, which contain a 



VEGBTABLBS 281 

large amount of proteid, they are chiefly valuable for their 
potash salts, and should form a part of each day's dietary. 
Many contain much cellulose, which gives needed bulk to 
the food. The legumes, peas, beans, and lentils may be 
used in place of flesh food. 

For the various vegetables different parts of the plant are 
used. Some are eaten in the natural state, others are 
cooked. 

Tubers White potatoes and Jerusalem artichokes 

1^^ r Beets, carrots, parsnips, radishes, sweet potatoes, 

\ salsify or oyster plant, and turnips 
Bulbs Garlic, onions, and shallots 
Stems Asparagus, celery, and chives 
. r Brussels sprouts, beet greens, cabbages, dandelions, 

\ lettuce, sorrel, spinach, aud watercress 
Flowers Canlifiower 
^ . j Beans, corn, cucumbers, okra, egg-plant, peas, lentils, 

\ squash, and tomatoes. 

Young, tender vegetables, — as lettuce, radishes, cucum- 
bers, water-cress, and tomatoes, — eaten uncooked, served 
separately or combined in salads, help to stimulate a flag- 
ging appetite, and when dressed with oil furnish considerable 
nutriment. 

Beans, and peas when old, should be employed in mak- 
ing purees and soups; by so doing, the outer covering of 
.cellulose, so irritating to the stomach, is removed. 

Care of Vegetables 

Summer vegetables should be cooked as soon after gather- 
ing as possible; in case they must be kept, spread on 
bottom of cool, dry, well-ventilated cellar, or place in ice- 
box. Lettuce may be best kept by sprinkling with cold 
water and placing in a tin pail closely covered. Wilted 
vegetables may be freshened by allowing to stand in cold 
water. Vegetables which contain sugar lose some of their 
sweetness by standing; corn and peas are more quickly 
affected than others. Winter vegetables should be kept in 
a cold, dry place. Beets, carrots, turnips, potatoes, etc.» 



282 BOSTON cooKnsra-soHooL cook book 

should be put in barrels or piled in bins, to exclade as much 
air as possible. Squash should be spread, and needs care- 
ful watching ; when dark spots appear, cook at once. 

In using canned goods, empty contents from can as soon 
as opened, lest the acid therein act on the tin to produce 
poisonous compounds, and let stand one hour, that it may 
become reoxygenated. Beans, peas, asparagus, etc., should 
be emptied into a strainer, drained, and cold water poured 
over them and allowed to run through. In using dried 
vegetables, soak in cold water several hours before cooking. 
A few years ago native vegetables were alone sold; but 
now our markets are largely supplied from the Southern 
States and California, thus allowing us fresh vegetables • 
throughout the year. 

Cooking of Vegetables 

A small scrubbing-brush, which may be bought for five 
cents, and two small pointed knives for preparing vegetables 
should be found in every kitchen. 

Vegetables should be washed in cold water, and cooked 
until soft in boiling salted water ; if cooked in an uncovered 
vessel, their color is better kept. For peas and beans add 
salt to water last half hour of cooking. Time for cooking 
the same vegetable varies according to freshness and age, 
therefore time-tables for cooking serve only as guides. 

Mushrooms and TmfELes 

These are classed among vegetables. Mushrooms, which 
grow about us abundantly, may be easily gathered, and as 
they contain considerable nutriment, should often be found 
on the table. While there are hundreds of varieties, one by 
a little study may acquaint herself with a dozen or more of 
the most common ones which are valuable as food. Consult 
W. Hamilton Gibson, "Our Edible Toadstools and Mush- 
rooms." Many might cause illness, but only a few varieties 
of the Amanita family are deadly poison. Mushrooms 
require heat and moisture, — a severe drought or very wet 
soil being unfavorable for their growth. Never gather 
mushrooms in the vicinity of decaying matter. They appear 



VEGBTABLBS 288 

the middle of May, and last until frost comes. Oampestris 
is the variety always found in market ; French canned are 
of this family. Boleti are dried, canned, and sold as cepes, 

Traffles 

Truffles belong to the same family as mushrooms, and 
are grown underground. France is the most famous field 
for their production, from which country they are exported 
in tin cans, and are too expensive for ordinary use. 

Artichokea 
French artichokes, imported throughout the year, are the 
ones principally used. They retail from thirty to forty 
cents each, and are cheapest and best in November, Decem- 
ber, and January. Artichokes are appearing in market from 
California and are somewhat cheaper in price than the 
French Artichoke. Jerusalem artichokes are employed for 
pickling, and can be bought for fifteen cents per quart 

Boiled ArtichokeB 

Cut off stem close to leaves, remove outside bottom 
leaves, trim artichoke, cut off one inch from top of leaves, 
and with a sharp knife remove choke ; then tie artichoke 
with a string to keep its shape. Soak one-half hour in 
cold water. Drain, and cook thirty to forty-five minutes 
in boiling, salted, acidulated water. Remove from water, 
place upside down to drain, then take o£f string. Serve 
with Bechamel or HoUandaise Sauce.' Boiled Artichokes 
often constitute a course at dinner. Leaves are drawn 
out separately with fingers, dipped in sauce, and fieshy ends 
only eaten, although the bottom is edible. Artichokes may 
be cut in quarters, cooked, drained, and served with Sauce 
Bearnaise. When prepared in this way they are served with 
mutton. 

Fried Artichokes 

Sprinkle Boiled Artichokes cut in quarters with salt, 
pepper, and finely chopped parsley. Dip in Batter I, fry in 
deep fat, and drain. In preparing artichokes, trim off tops 
of leaves closer than when served as Boiled Artichokes. 



284 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Artichoke Bottoms 

Remove all leaves and the choke. Trim bottoms in 
shape, and cook until soft in boiling, salted, acidulated 
water. Serve with Hollandaise or Bechamel Sauce. 

Stuffed Artichokes 

Prepare and cook as Boiled Artichokes, having them 
slightly underdone. Fill with Chicken Force-meat I or 
II. and bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven, basting 
twice with Thin White Sauce. Remove to serving dish and 
pour around Thin White Sauce. 

Asparagus 

Hothouse asparagus is found in market during winter, 
but is not very satisfactory, and is sold for about one 
dollar per bunch. Oyster Bay (white asparagus) appears 
first of May, and commands a very high price. Large and 
small green stalk asparagus is in season from first of June 
to middle of July, and cheapest the middle of June. 

Boiled Asparagus 

Cut off lower parts of stalks as far down as they will 
snap, untie bunches, wash, remove scales, and retie. Cook 
in boiling salted water fifteen minutes or until soft, leaving 
tips out of water first ten minutes. Drain, remove string, 
and spread with soft butter, allowing one and one-half 
tablespoons butter to each bunch asparagus. Asparagus is 
often broken or cut in inch pieces for boiling, cooking tips a 
shorter time than stalks. 

Asparagus on Toast 
Serve Boiled Asparagus on Buttered or Milk Toast. 

Asparagus in White Sauce 
Boil asparagus cut in one-inch pieces, drain, and add 
to White Sauce I, allowing one cup sauce to each bunch 
asparagus. Serve in Croustades of Bread for a vegetable 
course.

Pour Hollandaise Sauce I over Boiled Asparagus. 

Asparagus in Crusts 

Remove centres from small rolls, fry shells in deep fat, 
drain, and fill with Asparagus in White Sauce. 

Beans 

String Beans that are obtainable in winter come from 
California ; natives appear in market the last of June and 
continue until the last of September. There are two varie- 
ties, green (pole cranberry being best flavored) and yellow 
(butter bean). 

Shell Beans^ including horticultural and sieva, are sold in 
the pod or shelled, five quarts in pod making one quart 
shelled. They are found in market during July and August. 
Common lima and improved lima shell beans are in season 
in August and September. Dried litoa beans are procurable 
throughout the year. 

String Beans 

Remove strings, and snap or cut in one-inch pieces ; wash, 
and cook in boiling water from one to three hours, adding 
salt last half-hour of cooking. Drain, season with butter 
and salt 

Shell Beans 

Wash, and cook in boiling water from one to one and a 
half hours, adding salt last half-hour of cooking. Cook in 
sufficiently small quantity of water, that there may be 
none left to drain off when beans are cooked. Season 
with butter and salt. 

Cream of Lima Beans 

Soak one cup dried beans over night, drain, and cook 
in boiling salted water until soft ; drain, add three-fourths 
cup cream, an4 season with butter and salt. Reheat before 
serving. 



286 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Boiled Beetg 

Wash, and cook whole in boiling water until soft; time 
required being from one to four hours. Old beets will never 
be tender, no matter how long they may be cooked. Drain, 
and put in cold water that skins may be easily removed. 
Serve cut in quarters or slices. 

Sugared Beets 

4 hot boiled beets 1)4 tablespoons sugar 

3 tablespoons butter i^ teaspoon salt 

Cut beets in one-fourth inch slices, add butter, sugar, and 
salt ; reheat for serving. 

Pickled Beets 
Slice cold boiled beets and cover with vinegar. 

Beets, Sour Sauce 

Wash beets, and cook in boiling salted water until soft. 
Drain, and reserve one-half cup water in which beets were 
cooked. Plunge into cold water, rub off skins and cut into 
cubes. Reheat in 

Sour Sauce. Melt two tablespoons butter, add two table- 
spoons flour, and pour on the beet water. Add one-fourth 
cup, each, vinegar and cream, one teaspoon sugar, one-half 
teaspoon salt, and a few grains pepper. 

Harvard Beets 

Wash twelve small beets, cook in boiling water until soft, 
remove skins, and cut beets in thin slices, small cubes, or 
fancy shapes, using French vegetable cutter. Mix one-half 
cup sugar and one-half tablespoon corn-starch. Add one- 
half cup vinegar and let boil five minutes. Pour over beets, 
and let stand on back of range one-half hour. Just before 
serving add two tablespoons butter. 

Brussels Sprouts 

Brussels sprouts belong to the same family && cabbage, 
and the small heads grow from one to two inches apart, 



YEOBTABLBS 28T 

on the axis of the entire stem, one root yielding about two 
quarts. They are imported, and also grow in this country, 
being cheapest and best in December and January. 

BruBselB Sprouts in White Sauce 

Pick over, remove wilted leaves, and soak in cold water 
fifteen minutes. Cook in boiling salted water twenty min- 
utes, or until easily pierced with a skewer. Drain, and to 
each pint add one cup Whito Sauce I. 

Scalloped BrusBelB Sprouts 

Pick over, remove wilted leaves, and soak in cold water 
one quart sprouts. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, 
then drain. Wash celery and cut in pieces ; there should be 
one and one-half cups. Melt three tablespoons butter, add 
celery, cook two minutes, add three tablespoons flour, and 
pour on gradually one and one-half cups scalded milk ; add 
sprouts and turn mixture into a baking-dish. Cover with 
buttered crumbs and bake in a hot oven until crumbs are 
brown. 

Cabbage 

There are four kinds of cabbage in the market, — drum- 
head, sugar-loaf, Savoy, and purple ; and some variety may 
be found throughout the year. The Savoy is best for boil- 
ing; drum-head and purple for Cole-Slaw. In buying, 
select heavy cabbages. 

Boiled Cabbage 

Take off outside leaves, cut in quarters, and remove 
tough stalk. Soak in cold water and cook in an uncovered 
vessel in boiling salted water, to which is added one-fourth 
teaspoon soda ; this prevents disagreeable odor during cook- 
ing. Cook from thirty minutes to one hour, drain, and serve ; 
or chop, and season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

Bsealloped Cabbage 

Cut one-half boiled cabbage in pieces; put in buttered 
bftking-dish, aprinkle with salt and pepper, and add one 
i«p WMte Saoee I. Lift cabbage with fork, that it may be

well mixed with sauce, cover with buttered crumbs, and 
bake until crumbs are brown. 

German Cabbage 
Slice red cabbage and soak in cold water. Put one quart 
in stewpan with two tablespoons butter, one-half teaspoon 
salt, one tablespoon finely chopped onion, few gratings of 
nutmeg, and few grains cayenne; cover, and cook until 
cabbage is tender. Add two tablespoons vinegar and one- 
half tablespoon sugar, and cook five minutes. 

Cole-Slaw 

Select a small, heavy cabbage, take off outside leaves, 
and cut in quarters; with a sharp knife slice very thinly. 
Soak in cold water until crisp, drain, dry between towels, 
and mix with Cream Salad Dressing. 

Hot Slaw 

Slice cabbage as for Cole-Slaw, using one-half cabbage. 
Heat in a dressing made of yolks of two eggs slightly 
beaten, one-fourth cup cold water, one tablespoon butter, 
one- fourth cup hot vinegar, and one-half teaspoon salt, 
stirred over hot water until thickened. 

Carrots 

Carrots may always be found in market. New carrots 
appear last of April, and are sold in bunches ; these may be 
boiled and served, but carrots are chiefly used for flavoring 
soups, and for garnishing, on account of their bright color. 
To prepare carrots for cooking, wash and scrape, as best 
flavor and brightest color are near the skin. 

Carrots and Peas

Cauliflower 

Cauliflowers comprise the stalks and flowerets of a plant 
which belongs to the same family as Brussels sprouts and 
cabbage ; they may be obtained throughout the year, but are 
cheapest and best in September and October. In selecting 
cauliflowers, choose those with white heads and fresh green 
leaves ; if dark spots are on the heads, they are not fresh.

generally served raw. During the latter part of the summer 
they are gathered and pickled for subsequent use. Small 
pickled cucumbers are called gherkins. 

Sliced Cucumbers 

Remove thick slices from both ends and cut off a thick

or until tender in boiling salted water. Allow two quarts 
water to one peck dandelions. Season with butter^ salt, 
and pepper. Serve with vinegar. 

Lettuce 

Lettuce is obtainable all the year, and is especially 
valuable during the winter and spring, when other green 
vegetables in market command a high price. Although 
containing but little nutriment, it is useful for the large 
quantity of water and potash salts that it contains, and 
assists in stimulating the appetite. Curly lettuce is of less 
value than Tennis Ball, but makes an effective garnish. 

Lettuce should be separated by removing leaves from 
stalk (discarding wilted outer leaves), washed, kept in cold 
water until crisp, drained, and so placed on a towel that 
water may drop from leaves. A bag made from white 
mosquito netting is useful for drying lettuce. Wash lettuce

range lettuce for serving in nearly its original shape. 

Leeks on Toast 
Wash and trim leeks, cook in boiling salted water until 
soft, and drain. Arrange on pieces of buttered toast and 
pour over melted butter, seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Onions 

The onion belongs to the same family (Lily) as do shallot^ 
garlic^ leek, and chive. Onions are cooked and served as a 
vegetable. They are wholesome, and contain considerable 
nutriment, but are objectionable on acccount of the strong 
odor they impart to the breath, due to volatile substances 
absorbed by the blood, and by the blood carried to the 
lungS; where they are set free. The common garden onion 
is obtainable throughout the year, the new ones appearing 
in market about the first of June. In large centres Bermuda 
and Spanish onions are procurable from March Ist to June 
1st, and are of delicate flavor. 

Shallot, leek, garlic, and chive are principally used to 
give additional flavor to food. Shallot, garlic, and chive 
are used, to some extent, in making salads.

ParBiiips 

Parsnips are not so commonly served as other vegetables ; 
however, they often accompany a boiled dinner. They are 
raised mostly for feeding cattle. Unless young they con- 
tain a large amount of woody fibre, which extends through 
centre of roots and makes tiiem undesirable as food. 

Parsnips with Drawn Butter Sauce 

Wash and scrape parsnips, and cut in pieces two inches 
long and one-half inch wide and thick. Cook five minutes 
in boiling salted water, or until soft. Drain, and to two

salted water. Drain, plunge into cold water, when skins 
will be found to slip off easily. Mash, season with butter, 
salt, and pepper, shape in small flat round cakes, roll in flour, 
and saut^ in butter. 

Peas 

Peas contain, next to beans, the largest percentage of 
proteid of any of the vegetables, and when young are easy 
of digestion. They appear in market as early as April, 
coming from Florida and California, and although high 
in price are hardly worth buying, having been picked so 
long. Native peas may be obtained the middle of June, 
and last until the first of September. The early June are 
small peas, contained in a small pod. McLean, the best 
peas, are small peas in large flat pods. Champion peas are 
large, and the pods are well filled, but they lack sweetness. 
Marrowfat peas are the largest in the market, and are 
usually sweet 

Boiled Peas 

Remove peas from pods, cover with cold water, and let 
stand one-half hour. Skim off undeveloped peas which rise 
to top of water, and drain remaining peas. Cook until soft 
in a small quantity of boiling water, adding salt the last fif-

teen minuteB of cookii>g. (Consult Time Table for Cooking, 
p. 28). There should be but little, if any, water to drain 
from peas when they are cooked. Season with butter, salt, 
and pepper. If peas have lost much of their natural sweet- 
ness, they are improved by the addition of a small amount 
of sugar. 

Creamed Peas 

Drain Boiled Peas, and to two cups peas add three-fourths 
cup White Sauce II. Canned peas are often drained^ rinsed, 
and reheated in this way. 

Pea Timbales

Pumpkina 

Pumpkins are boiled or steamed same as squash, bat re- 
quire longer cooking. They are principally used for making 
pies. 

Radishea 

Radishes may be obtained throughout the year. There 
are round and long varieties, the small round ones being 
considered best. They are bought in bunches, six or seven 
constituting a bunch. Radishes are used merely for a relish, 
and are served uncooked. To prepare radishes for table, 
remove leaves, stems, and tip end of root, scrape roots, and 
serve on crushed ice. Round radishes look very attractive 
cut to imitate tulips, when they should not be scraped ; to 
accomplish this, begin at root end and make six incisions 
through skin running three-fourths length of radish. Pass 
knife under sections of skin, and cut down as far as incisions 
extend. Place in cold water, and sections of skin will fold 
back, giving radish a tulip-like appearance. 

Spinach 

Spinach is cheapest and best in early summer, but is ob- 
tainable throughout tbe year. It ^ives variety to winter diet, 
when most green vegetables are expensive and of inferior 
quality. 

Boiled Spinach 

Remove roots, carefully pick ovr.r (discarding wilted 
leaves), and wash in several waters to be sure that it is free 
from all sand. When young and tender put in a stewpan, 
allow to heat gradually, and boil twenty-five minutes, or 
until tender, in its ovn juices. Old spinach is better cooked 
in boiling salted water, allowing two quarts water to one 
peck spinach. Drain thoroughly, chop finely, reheat, and 
season with butter, salt, and pepper. Mound on a serving 
dish and garnish with slices of '' hard-boiled " eggs and toast 
points. The green color of spinach is better retained by 
cooking in a large quantity of water in an uncovered 
vessel.

Squash 

Summer squash, which are in market during the summer 
months, should be young, tender, and thin skinned. The 
common varieties are the white round and yellow crook- 
neck. Some of the winter varieties appear in market as 
early as the middle of August; among the most common 
are Marrow, Turban, and Hubbard. Turban and Hubbard 
are usually drier than Marrow. Marrow and Turban have 
a thin shell, which may be pared off before cooking. Hub- 
bard Squash has a very hard shell, which must be split in 
order to separate squash in pieces, and squash then cooHed 
in the shell. In selecting winter squash, see that it is heavy 
in proportion to its size.

POTATOBS 309 



CHAPTER XX 
POTATOES 

COMPOSITION 

Water, 78.9% Proteid, 2.1 % 

Starch, 18% Mineral matter, .9% 

Fat 1.% 

POTATOES stand pre-eminent among the vegetables 
used for food. They are tubers belonging to the 
Nightshade family ; their hardy growth renders them easj> 
of cultivation in almost any soil or climate, and, resisting 
early frosts, they may be raised in a higher latitude tiian the 
cereals. 

They give needed bulk to food rather than nutriment, 
and, lacking in proteid, should be used in combination with 
meat, fish, or eggs. 

Potatoes contain an acrid juice, the greater part of which 
lies near the skin ; it passes into the water during boiling of 
potatoes, and escapes with the steam from a baked potato. 

Potatoes are best in the fall, and keep well through the 
winter. By spring the starch is partially changed to dex- 
trin, giving the potatoes a sweetness, and when cooked a 
waxiness. The same change takes place when potatoes are 
frozen. To prevent freezing, keep a pail of cold water 
standing near them. 

Potatoes keep best in a cool dry cellar, in barrels or piled 
in a bin. When sprouts appear they should be removed; 
receiving their nourishment from the starch, they deteriorate 
the potato. 

New potatoes may be compared to unripe fruit, the starch 
grains not having reached maturity ; therefore they should 
not be given to children or invalids. 



810 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Sweet Potatoes 

Sweet potatoes, although analogous to white potatoes, are 
fleshy roots of the plant, belong to a different family (Con- 
volvulus), and contain a much larger percentage of sugar. 
Oui' own country produces large quantities of sweet potatoes, 
which may be grown as far north as New Jersey and South- 
ern Michigan. Kiln-dried sweet potatoes are the best, as 
they do not so quickly spoil. 

Baked Potatoes 

Select smooth, medium-sized potatoes. Wash, using a 
vegetable brush, and place in dripping-pan. Bake in hot 
oven forty minutes or until soft, remove from oven, and serve 
at once. If allowed to stand, unless the skin is ruptured for 
escape of steam, they become soggy. Properly baked pota- 
toes are more easily digested than potatoes cooked in any 
other way, as some of the starch is changed to dextrin by 
the intense heat. They are better cooked in boiling water 
than baked in a slow oven. 

Boiled Potatoes 

Select potatoes of uniform size. Wash, pare, and drop 
at once in cold water to prevent discoloration; soak one- 
half hour In the fall, and one to two hours in winter and 
spring. Cook in boiling salted water until soft, which is 
easily determined by piercing with a skewer. For seven 
potatoes allow one tablespoon salt, and boiling' water to 
cover. Drain from water, and keep uncovered in warm 
place until serving time. Avoid sending to table in a cov- 
ered vegetable dish. In boiling large potatoes, it often 
happens that outside is soft, while centre is underdone. To 
finish cooking without potatoes breaking apart, add one pint 
cold water, which drives heat to centre, thus accomplishing 
the cooking. 

Riced Potatoes 

Force hot boiled potatoes through a potato ricer or coarse 
strainer. Serve lightly piled in a hot vegetable dish. 



POTATOES 811

CHAPTER XXI 
SALADS AND SALAD DRESSmOS 

SALADS, which constitute a course iu almost every dinner, 
but a few years since seldom appeared on the table. They 
are now made in an endless variety of ways, and are com- 
posed of meat, fish, vegetables (alone or in combination) or 
fruits, with the addition of a dressing. Tlie salad plants, 
lettuce, watercress, chiccory, cucumbers, etc., contain but 
little nutriment, but are cooling, refreshing, and assist in 
stimulating the appetite. They are valuable for the water 
and potash salts they contain. The olive oil, which usually 
forms the largest part of the dressing, furnishes nutriment, 
and is of much value to the system. 

Salads made of greens should always be served crisp and 
cold. The vegetables should be thoroughly washed, allowed 
to stand in cold or ice-water until crisp, then drained and 
spread on a towel and set aside in a cold place until serving 
time. See Lettuce, page 294. Dressing may be added at 
table or just before sending to table. If greens are allowed 
to stand in dressing they will soon wilt It should be re- 
membered that winter greens are raised under glass and 
should be tror\ted as any other hotliouse plant. Lettuce will 
be affected by a change of temperature and wilt just as 
quickly as delicate flowers. 

Canned or cold cooked left-over vegetables are well utilized 
in salads, but are best mixed with French Dressing and 
allowed to stand in a cold place one hour before serving. 
Where several A-egei tables are uscmI in the same salad they 
should be marinated separately, and arranged for serving 
just before sending to table. 



SALAD DBB8SINOS 823 

Meat for salads should be freed from skin and gristle, cut 
in small cubes, and allowed to stand mixed with French 
Dressing before combining with vegetables. Fish should be 
flaked or cut in cubes. 

Where salads are dressed at table, first sprinkle with salt 
and pepper, add oil, and lastly vinegar. If vinegar is added 
before oil, the greens will become wet, and oil will not cling, 
but settle to bottom of bowl. 

A Chapon. liemovc a small piece from end of French 
loaf and rub over with a clove of garlic, first dipped in salt. 
Place in bottom of salad bowl before arranging salad. A 
chapon is often used in vegetable salads, and gives an 
agreeable additional flavor. 

To Marinate. The word marinate, as used in cookery, 
means to add salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar to a salad 
ingredient or mixture, then allow to let stand until well 
seasoned. 



SALAD DRESSmaS 

French Dreaaing 

}4 teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vinegar 

^ teaspoon pepper 4 tablespoons olive oil

the addition of a few drops onion juice. French Dressing 
is more easily prepared and largely used than any other 
dressing.

Mix dry ingredients, add egg yolks, and when well mixed 
add one-half teaspoon of vinegar. Add oil gradually, at 
first drop by drop, and stir constantly. As mixture thickens, 
thin with vinegar or lemon juice. Add oil, and vinegar or 
lemon juice alternately, until all is used, stirring or beating 
constantly. If oil is added too rapidly, dressing will have a 
curdled appearance. A smooth consistency may be restored 
by taking yolk of another egg and adding curdled mixture 
slowly to it It is desirable to have bowl containing mix- 
ture placed in a larger bowl of crushed ice, to which a small 
quantity of water has been added. Olive oil for making 
Mayonnaise should always be thoroughly chilled. A silver 
fork, wire whisk, small wooden spoon, or Dover Egg-beater 
may be used as preferred. If one has a Keystone Egg- 
beater, dressing may be made very quickly by its use. 
Mayonnaise should be stiff enough to hold its shape. It soon 
liqueties when added to meat or vegetables; therefore it 
should be added just before serving time. 

Mayonnaise Dressing II 

Use same ingredients as for Mayonnaise Dressing I, add- 
ing mashed yolk of a *' hard-boiled " egg to dry ingredients.

Swedish Timbales 

% cup flour y^ cup milk 

}4 teaspoon salt 1 Qgg 

1 teaspoon sugar 1 tablespoon olive oil 

Mix dry ingredients, add milk gradually, and beaten egg ; 
then add olive oil. Shape, using a hot timbale iron, fry in 
deep fat until crisp and brown ; take from iron' and invert 
on brown paper to drain. 

To Heat Timbale Iron. Heat fat until nearly hot enough 
to fry uncooked mixtures. Put iron into hot fat, having fat 
deep enough to more than cover it, and let stand until 
heated. The only way of knowing when iron is of right 
temperature is to take it from fat, shake what fat may drip 
from it, lower in batter to three-fourths its depth, raise from 
batter, then immerse in hot fat. If batter does not cling to 
iron, or drops from iron as soon as immersed in fat, it is 
either too hot or not sufficiently heated. 

To Porm Timbalea. Turn timbale batter into a cup. 
Lower hot iron into cup, taking care that batter covers 
iron to only three-fourths its depth. When immersed in 
fat, mixture will rise to top of iron, and when crisp and 
brown may be easily slipped ofif. If too much batter is 
used, in cooking it will rise over top of iron, and in order 
to remove timbale it must be cut around with a sharp knife 
close to top of iron. If the cases are soft rather than crisp, 
batter is too thick and must be diluted with milk. 

Fill cases with Creamed Oysters, Chicken, Sweetbreads, 
or Chicken and Sweetbreads in combination with Mush- 
rooms.

Use recipe for and fry same as Swedish Timbales, using a

Aspic jelly is always made with meat stock, and is princi- 
pally used in elaborate entrees where fish, chicken, game, or 
vegetables are to be served moulded in jelly. In making 
Aspic Jelly, use as much liquid as the pan which is to con- 
tain moulded dish will hold. 

Put vegetables, seasonings, and wine in a saucepan ; 
cook eight minutes, and strain, reserving liquid. Add gela- 
tine to stock, then add lemon juice and strained liquid. 
Season with salt and cayenne and whites of eggs slightly 
beaten. Add slowly to remaining mixture, stirring con- 
stantly until boiling-point is reached. Place on back of 
range and let stand thirty minutes. Strain through a 
double cheese-cloth placed over a fine wire strainer, or 
through a jelly bag. 

Tomatoes in Aaplo 

Peel six small firm tomatoes, and remove pulp, having 
opening in tops as small as possible. Sprinkle insides with 
salt, invert, and let stand thirty minutes. Fill with vegeta- 
ble or chicken salad. Cover tops with Mayonnaise to which 
has been added a small quantity of dissolved gelatine, and 
garnish with capers and sliced pickles.- Place a pan in ice- 
water, cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, and let stand 



ENTREES 883 

until jelly is firm. Arrange tomatoes on Jelly garnished side 
down. Add more aspic jelly mixture, let stand until firm, 
and so continue until all is used. Chill thoroughly , turn on 
a serving dish, and garnish around base with parsley. 

Stuffed Olives in Aspic 

Stone olives, using an olive stoner, and fill cavities thus 
made with green butter. Place small Dario moulds in pan of 
ice-water, and pour in aspic jelly mixture (see p. 382) one- 
fourth inch deep. When firm put an olive in each mould 
(keeping olives in place by means of small wooden skewers) 
and add aspic by spoonfuls until moulds are filled. Chill 
thoroughly, remove to circular slices of liver sausage, garnish 
with green butter forced through a pastry bag and tube, yolks 
of " hard-boiled " eggs forced through a strainer, and red pep- 
pers cut in fancy shapes. 

Green Butter. Mix yolk one ^* hard-boiled " egg, two table- 
spoons butter, one sprig parsley, one sprig tarragon, one 
small shallot, one-half teaspoon anchovy paste, one teaspoon 
capers, and one teaspoon chopped gherkins, and pound in a 
mortar; then rub through a very fine sieve. Season with 
salt and pepper, and add a few drops vinegar. 

Tongue in Aspic 

Cook a tongue according to directions on page 210. After 
removing skin and roots, run a skewer through tip of tongue 
and fleshy part, thus keeping tongue in shape. When cool, 
remove skewer. Put a round pan in ice- water, cover bottom 
with brown aspic, and when firm decorate with cooked car- 
rot, turnip, beet cut in fancy shapes, and parsley. Cover 
with aspic jelly mixture, adding it by spoonfuls so as not to 
disarrange vegetables. When this layer of mixture is firm, 
put in tongue, adding gradually remaining mixture as in To- 
matoes in Aspic.

884 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

a pan in ice- water, cover bottom with aspic jelly mixture, 
and when firm garnish with truffles and Pigg custard thinly 
sliced and cut in fancy shapes. The smaller the shapes 
the more elaborate may be the designs. When garnishing 
with small shapes, pieces are so difficult to handle that 
they should be taken on the pointed end of a larding-needle, 
and placed as desired on jelly. Add aspic mixture by 
spoonfuls, that designs may not be disturbed. When mix- 
ture is added, and firm to the depth of three-fourths inch, 
place in the bird, breast down. If sides of mould are to 
be decorated, dip pieces in jelly and they will cling to pan. 
Add remaining mixture gradually as in Tomatoes in Aspic. 
Small birds, chicken, capou, or turkey, may be put in 
aspic. 

Egg Custard for Decorating

one-half cup cracker crumbs, hot stock to moisten, salt, 
pepper, celery salt, cayenne, lemon juice, and one egg 
slightly beaten. In stuffing boned chicken, stuff body, legs, 
and wings, being careful that too much stuffing is not used, 
as an allowance must be made for the swelling of cracker 
crumbs. 

Spring Mousse 

Chop three-fourths cup cold cooked chicken or veal, and 
pound in a mortar. Add gradually one-half cup heavy 
cream, and force mixture through pur^e strainer. Add

one tablespoon granulated gelatine soaked in three-fourths 
tablespoon each tarragon vinegar and cold water. Strain, 
and cool. 

Jellied Vegetables 

Soak one tablespoon granulated gelatine in one-fourth cup 
cold water, and dissolve in one cup boiling water ; then add 
one-fourth cup, each, sugar and vinegar, two tablespoons 
lemon juice, and one teaspoon salt. Strain, cool, and when 
beginning to stiffen, add one cup celery cut in small pieces, 
one-half cup finely shredded cabbage, and one and one-half 
canned pimentoes cut in small pieces. Turn into a mould

tinue stirring until mixture thickens and a coating is formed 
on the spoon^ strain immediately ; chill and flavor. If cooked 
too long the custard will curdle ; should this happen, by 
using a Dover egg-beater it may be restored to a smooth 
consistency, but custard will not be as thick. Eggs should 
be beaten slightly for custard, that it may be of smooth, 
thick consistency. To prevent scum from forming, cover 
with a perforated tin. When eggs are scarce, use yolks two 
eggs and one-half tablespoon corn-starch.

To "VThip Cream 

Thin and heavy cream are both used in making and gar- 
nishing desserts. 

Heavy cream is bought in half-pint, pint, and quart glass 
jars, and usually retails at sixty cents per quart ; thin or 
strawberry cream comes in glass jars or may be bought in 
bulk, and usually retails for thirty cents per quart. Heavy 
cream is very rich ; for which reason, when whipped without 



426 BOSTON COOKmO-SdHOOL COOK BOOK 

being diluted, it is employed as a garnish^ even when so 
used, it is generally diluted with one-fourth to one-third its 
bulk in milk ; when used in combination with other ingredients 
for making desserts, it is diluted from one-half to two-thirds 
its bulk in milk. Thin cream is whipped without being 
diluted. Cream should be thoroughly chilled for whipping. 
Turn cream to be whipped into a bowl (care being taken not 
to select too large a bowl), and set in pan of crushed ice, 
to which water is added that cream may be quickly chilled ; 
without addition of water, cream will not be so thoroughly 
chilled. 

For whipping heavy cream undiluted, or diluted with one- 
third or less its bulk in milk, use Dover egg-beater ; un- 
diluted heavy cream if beaten a moment too long will come 
to butter. Heavy cream diluted, whipped, sweetened, and 
flavored, is often served with puddings, and called Cream 
Sauce. 

Thin cream is whipped by using a whip churn, as is heavy 
cream when diluted with one-half to two-thirds its bulk in 
milk. Place churn in bowl containing cream, hold down 
cover with left hand, with right hand work dasher with quick 
downward and slow upward motions; avoid raising dasher 
too high in cylinder, thus escaping spattering of cream. 
The first whip which appears should be stirred into cream, 
as air bubbles are too large and will break ; second whip 
should be removed by spoonfuls to a strainer, strainer 
to be placed in a pan, as some cream will drain through. 
The first cream which drains through may be turned into 
bowl to be rewhipped, and continue whipping as long as 
possible. 

There will be some cream left in bowl which does not 
come above perforations in whip churn, and cannot be 
whipped. Cream which remains may be scalded and used 
to dissolve gelatine when rfiaking desserts which require 
gelatine. Cream should treble its bulk in whipping. By 
following these directions one need have no difficulty, if 
cream is of right consistency; always bearing in mind heavy 
cream must be whipped with a Dover egg-beater ; thin cream 
must be whipped with a churn.

CHAPTER XXVI 
ICES, ICE CBEAMS, AND OTHER FBOZEN DESSEBTS 

ICES and other frozen dishes comprise the most popular 
desserts. Hygieuically speaking, they cannot be recom- 
mended for the final course of a dinner, as cold mixtures 
reduce the temperature of the stomach, thus retarding diges- 
tion until the normal temperature is again reached. But 
how cooling, refreshing, and nourishing, when properly taken, 
and of what inestimable value in the sick room ! 

Frozen dishes include : — 

Water Ice, — fruit juice sweetened, diluted with water, and 
frozen. 

Sherbet^ — water ice to which is added a small quantity of 
dissolved gelatine or beaten whites of eggs. 

Frapp4, — water ice frozen to consistency of mush ; in 
freezing, equal parts of salt and ice being used to make it 
granalar. 

Punchy — water ice to which is added spirit and spice. 

Sorbet^ — strictly speaking, frozen punch; the name is 
often given to a water ice where several kinds of fruit are 
used. 

Philadelphia Ice Cream^ — thin cream, sweetened, flavored, 
and frozen. 

Plain Ice Cream, — custard foundation, thin cream, and 
flavoring. 

Mousse^ — heavy cream, beaten until stiff, sweetened, 
flavored, placed in a mould, packed in salt and ice (using 
two parts crushed ice to one part salt), and allowed to stand 
three hours ; or wliip from thin cream may be used folded 
into mixture containing small quantity of gelatine,

How to Freeze Desserts 

The prejudice of thinking a frozen dessert difficult to pre* 
pare has long since been overcome. With ice cream freezer, 
burlap bag, wooden mallet or axe, small saucepan, sufficient 
ice and coarse rock salt, the process neither takes much time 
nor patience. Snow may be used instead of ice; if not 
readily acted on by salt, pour in one cup cold water. Crush 
ice finely by placing in bag and giving a few blows with 
mallet or broad side of axe ; if there are any coarse pieces, 
remove them. Place can containing mixture to be frozen in 
wooden tub, cover, and adjust top. Turn crank to make 
sure can fits in socket. Allow three level measures ice to 
one of salt, and repeat until ice and salt come to top of can, 
packing solidly, using handle of mallet to force it down. If 
only small quantity is to be frozen, the ice and salt need 
come only a little higher in the tub than mixture to be frozen. 
These are found the best proportions of ice and salt to 
insure smooth, fine-grained cream, sherbet, or water ice, 
while equal parts of salt and ice are used for freezing frappe. 
If a larger proportion of salt is used, mixture will freeze iu 
shorter time and be of granular consistency, which is desirable 
only for frappe. 

The mixture increases in bulk during freezing, so the can 
should never be more than three-fourths filled; by over- 
crowding can, cream w^ill be made coarse-grained. Turn the 
crank slowly and steadily to expose as large surface of mix- 
ture as possible to ice and salt. After frozen to a mush, the 
crank may be turned more rapidly, adding more ice and salt 
if needed ; never draw off salt water until mixture is frozen, 
unless there is possibility of its getting into the can, for salt 
water is what effects freezing; until ice melts, no change 
will take place. After freezing is accomplished, draw off 
water, remove dasher, and with spoon pack solidly. Put 
cork in opening of cover, then put on cover. Re-pack 
freezer, using four measures ice to one of salt Place over 
top newspapers or piece of carpet ; when serving time comes, 
remove can, wipe carefully, and place in vessel of cool water ; 
let stand one minute, remove cover, and run a knife around 



lOES, ICE CBEAMS, ETC. 436 

edge of cream, invert can on serving dish, and frozen mix- 
tare will slip out. Should there be any difficulty, a cloth 
wrung out of hot water, passed over can, will aid in removing 
mixture. 

To Line a Mould 

Allow mould to stand in salt and ice until well chilled. 
Remove cover, put in mixture by spoonfuls, and spread with 
hack of spoon or a case knife evenly three-quarters iuch 
thick. 

To Mould Frozen Mixtures 

"When frozen mixtures are to be bricked or moulded, avoid 
freezing too hard. Pack mixture solidly in moulds and cover 
with buttered paper, buttered side up. Have moulds so well 
filled that mixture is forced down sides of mould jrhen cover 
is pressed down. Re-pack in salt and ice, using four parts 
ice to one part salt. If these directions are carefully fol- 
lowed, one miay feel no fear that salt water will enter cream, 
even though moulds be immersed in salt water.

CHAPTER XXVII 
PASTEY 

PASTRY cannot be easily excluded from the menu of 
the New Englander. Who can dream of a Thanks- 
giving dinner without a pie! The last decade has done 
much to remove pies from the daily bill of fare, and in 
their place are found delicate puddings and seasonable 
fruits. 

If pastry is to be served, have it of the best, — light, flaky, 
and tender. 

To pastry belongs, Ist, Puff Paste ; 2d,^Plain Paste. 

Puff paste, which to many seems so difficult of preparation, 
is rarely attempted by any except professionals. As a mat- 
ter of fact, one who has never handled a rolling-pin is less 
liable to fail, under the guidance of a good teacher, than an 
old cook, who finds it difficult to overcome the bad habit of 
using too much force in rolling. It is necessary to work 
rapidly and with a light touch. A cold room is of great 
advantage. 

For making pastry, pastry flour and the best shortenings, 
thoroughly chilled, are essential. Its lightness depends on 
the amount of air enclosed and expansion of that air in bak- 
ing. The flakiness depends upon kind and amount of 
shortening used. Lard makes more tender crust than but- 
ter, but lacks flavor which butter gives. Puff paste is 
usually shortened with butter, though some chefs prefer 
beef suet. Eggs and ice were formerly used, but are not 
essentials. 

Butter should be washed if pastry is to be of the best, so 
as to remove salt and buttermilk, thus making it of a waxy 
consistency, easy to handle,

PASTRY 461 

Rules for Washing Butter. Scald and chill an earthen 
bowl. Heat palms of hands in hot water, and chill in cold 
water. Bj following these directions, butter will not adhere 
to bowl nor hands. Wash butter in bowl by squeezing with 
hands until soft and waxy, placing bowl under a cold-water 
faucet and allowing water to run. A small amount of butter 
may be washed by using a wooden spoon in place of the 
hands. 

For rolling paste, use a smooth wooden board, and wooden 
rolling-pin with handles. 

Puff paste should be used for vol-au-vents, patties^ ris- 
soles, bouch^es, cheese straws, tarts, etc. It may be used 
for rims and upper crusts of pies, but never for lower crusts. 
Plain paste may be used where pastry is needed, except for 
Yol-au-vents and patties. 

Puff Paste 

1 poand butter 1 pound pastry flour or 14 ozs. bread flour 
Cold water 

Wash the butter, pat and fold until no water flies. Re- 
serve two tablespoons of butter, and shape remainder into a 
circular piece one-half inch thick, and put on floured board. 
Work two tablespoons of butter into flour with the tips of 
fingers of the right hand. Moisten to a dough with cold 
water, turn on slightly floured board, and knead one minute. 
Cover with towel, and let stand five minutes. 

Pat and roll one- fourth inch thick, keeping paste a little 
wider than long, and corners square. If this cannot be ac- 
complished with rolling-pin, draw into shape with fingers. 
Place butter on centre of lower half of paste. Cover butter 
by folding upper half of paste over it Press edges firmly, 
to enclose as much air as possible. 

Fold right side of paste over enclosed butter, the left side 
under enclosed butter. Turn paste half-way round, cover, 
and let stand five minutes. Pat, and roll one-fourth inch 
thick, having paste longer than wide, lifting often to prevent 
paste from sticking, and dredging board slightly with flour 
when necessary. Fold from ends towards centre, making 
three layers. Cover, and let stand five minutes. Repeat 



462 BOSTON COOKINChSOHOOL COOK BOOK 

twice, turning paste half-way round each time before rolling. 
After fourth rolling, fold from ends to centre, and double, 
making four layers. Put in cold place to chill; if outside 
temperature is not sufficiently cold, fold paste in a towel, put 
in a dripping-pan, and place between dripping pans of crushed 
ice. If paste is to be kept for several days, wrap in a nap- 
kin, put in tin pail and cover tightly, then put in cold place ; 
if in ice box, do not allow pail to come in direct contact with 
ice. 

To Bake Puff Paste 

Baking of puff paste requires as much care and judgment 
as making. After shaping, chill thoroughly before baking. 
Puff paste requires hot oven, greatest heat coming from the 
bottom, that the paste may properly rise. While rising it is 
often necessary to decrease the heat by lifting covers or 
opening the check to stove. Turn frequently, that it may 
rise evenly. When it has risen its full height, slip a pan 
under the sheet on which paste is baking to prevent burning 
on the bottom. Puff paste should be baked on a tin sheet 
covered with a double thickness of brown paper, or dripping- 
pan may be used, lined with brown paper. The temperature 
for baking of patties should be about the same as for raised 
biscuit ; vol-au-vents require less heat, and are covered for 
first half-hour to prevent scorching on top. 

Patty Shells 
« 

Roll puff paste one-quarter inch thick, shape with a patty 
cutter, first dipped in flour ; remove centres from one-haLf 
the rounds with smaller cutter. Brush over with cold water 
the larger pieces near the edge, and fit on rings, pressing 
lightly. Place in towel between pans of crushed ice, and 
chill until paste is stiff; if cold weather, chill out of doors. 
Place on iron or tin sheet covered with brown paper, and 
bake twenty-five minutes in hot oven. The shells should rise 
their full height and begin to brown in twelve to fifteen min- 
utes ; continue browning, and finish baking in twenty-five 
minutes. Pieces cut from centre of rings of patties may be 
baked and used for patty covers, or put together, rolled, and

cat for unders. Trimmings from puff paste should be care- 
folly laid on top of each other, patted, and rolled out 

Vcl-au-ventB 

Roll puff paste one-third inch thick, mark an oval on paste 
with cutter or mould, and cut out with sharp knife, first 
dipped in flour. Brush over near the edge with cold water, 
put on a rim three-fourths inch wide, press lightly, chill, and 
bake. Vol-au-vents require for baking forty-five minutes to 
one hour. During the first half- hour they should be covered, 
watched carefully, and frequently turned. The paste cut 
from centre of rim should be rolled one-quarter inch thick, 
shaped same size as before rolling, chilled, baked, and used 
for cover to the Vol au-vent 

Qnick Puff Paste 

1 cup bread flour Cold water 

1 tablespoon lard % cup butter 

Work lard into flour, first using knife then tips of fingers. 
Moisten to a dough with cold water, pat, and roll out same 
as Puff Paste. Dot paste with small pieces of butter, using 
one- third the quantity. Dredge with fiour, fold from ends 
toward centre, then double, making four layers. Pat, and 
roll out. Repeat until butter is used. Roll, shape, chill, and 
bake in a hot oven.

to flour, and work in lard with tips of fingers or case knife. 
Moisten to dough with cold water ; ice-water is not an essen- 
tial, but is desirable in summer. Toss on board dredged 
sparingly with flour, pat, and roll out ; fold in butter as for 
puff paste, pat, and roll out. Fold so as to make three lay- 
ers, turn half-way round, pat, and roll out; repeat The

Cold water 

Wash butter. Mix salt with flour, put in chopping tray, 
add lard and butter, and chop until well mixed. Moisten to 
a dough with cold water. Toss n floured cloth (Magic 
Cover), pat, and roll out. Fold so as to make three layers, 
turn half-way round, pat, and roll out; repeat. Should the 
butter be too hard, it will not mix readily with the flour, in 
which case the result will be a tough crust Omit lard, and 
use all butter, if preferred. 

Quick Paste 

\}4 cups flour }^ cup cottolene or cocoanut 

^ teaspoon salt butter 

Cold water 

Mix salt with flour, cut in shortening with knife. Moisten 
to dough with cold water. Toss on floured board, pat. roll 
out, and roll up like a jelly roll. Use one- third cup of short- 
ening if a richer paste is desired. 

Paste with Lard 

1% cups flour J3 cup lard 

% teaspoon salt Cold water 

Mix salt with flour. Reserve one and one-fourth table- 
spoons lard, work in remainder to flour, using tips of fingers 
or a case knife. Moisten to a dough with water. Toss on 
a floured board, pat, and roll out. Spread with one table- 
spoon resers^ed lard, dredge with flour, roll up like a jelly 
roll, pat, and roll out ; again roll up. Cut from the end of 
roll a piece large enough to line a pie plate. Pat and roll 
out, keeping the paste as circular in form as possible. With 
care and experience there need be no trimmings. Worked- 
over pastry is never as satisfactory. The remaining one- 
fourth tablespoon lard is used to dot over upper crust of pie 



PASTRT 465 

JQst before sending to oven; this gives the pie a flaky 
appearance. Ice- water has a similar effect If milk is 
brushed over the pie it has a glazed appearance. This 
quantity of paste will make one pie with two crusts and a 
few puffs, or two pies with one crust where the rim is built 
up and fluted.

cold water, and spi inkle with chopped nut meat seasoned 
with salt. Return to oven to slightly brown nut meats. 
Serve with salad course. 

Quality Paste 

2 cups flour % cup batter 

J^ cup lard Ice water 

Put flour in bowl, add lard, and cut it in with knife. When 
finely chopped add water to make a very stiff dough, using 
as little as possible. Cut the butter into the dough leaving 
it in rather coarse pieces. Chill in icebox for several hours 
or over night. Place ball of paste on fioured cloth, pat and 
roll out. Fold so as to make three layers, turn half way 
round, pat and roll out. Pat, roll and fold four times, shape 
and bake at once in hot oven.

CHAPTER XXVIII 

PIES 

ASTE for pies should be one-fourth inch thick and 
rolled a little larger than the plate to allow for shrink- 
ing. In dividing paste for pies, allow more for upper than 
under crusts. Always perforate upper crusts that steam 
may escape. Some make a design, others pierce with a 
large fork. 

Flat rims for pies should be cut in strips three-fourths 
inch wide. Under crusts should be brushed with cold water 
before putting on rims, and rims slightly fulled, otherwise 
they will shrink from edge of plate. The pastry-jagger, a 
simple device for cutting paste, makes rims with fluted 
edges. 

Pies requiring two crusts sometimes have a rim between 
the crusts. This is mostly confined to mince pieces, where 
there is little danger of juice escaping. Sometimes a rim 
is placed over upper crust. Where two pieces of paste 
are put together, the under piece should always be brushed 
with cold water, the upper piece placed over, and the two 
pressed lightly together ; otherwise they will separate during 
baking. 

When juicy fruit is used for filling pies, some of the 
juices are apt to escape during baking. As a precaution, 
bind with a strip of cotton cloth wrung out of cold water 
and cut one inch wide and long enough to encircle the 
plate. Squash, pumpkin, and custard pies are much less 
care during baking when bound. Where cooked fruits are 
used for filling, it is desirable to bake crusts separately. 
This is best accomplished by covering an inverted deep 
I pie plate with paste and baking for under crust Prick 

I with a fork before baking. Slip from plate, and fill- For 



PIK8 467 

upper crusts, roll a piece of paste a little larger than the 
pie plate, prick, and bake on a tin sheet. 

For baking pies, perforated tin plates are used. They 
may be bought shallow or deep. By the use of such plates 
the under crust is well cooked. Pastry should be thor- 
oughly baked and well browned. Pies require from thirty- 
five to forty-five minutes for baking. Never grease a pie 
plate ; good pastry greases its own tin. Slip pies, when 
slightly cooled, to earthen plates. 

Apple Pie I 

4 or 5 sour apples ^ teaspoon salt 

^ cup sugar 1 teaspoon butter 

^ teaspoon grated nutmeg 1 teaspoon lemon juice 

Few gratings lemon rind 

Line pie plate with paste. Pare, core, and cut the apples 
into eighths, put row around plate one-half inch from edge, 
and work towards centre until plate is covered; then pile 
on remainder. Mix sugar, nutmeg, salt, lemon juice, and 
grated rind, and sprinkle over apples. Dot over with 
butter. Wet edges of under crust, cover with upper crust, 
and press edges together. 

Bake forty to forty-five minutes in moderate oven. A 
very good pie may. be made without butter, lemon juice, and 
grated rind. Cinnamon may be substituted for nutmeg. 
Evaporated apples may be used in place of fresh fruit. If 
used, they should be soaked over night in cold water. 

Apple Pie II 

Use same ingredients as for Apple Pie I. Place in small 
earthen baking-dish and add hot water to prevent apples 
from burning. Cover closely, and bake three hours in very 
slow oven, when apples will be a dark red color. Brown 
sugar may be used instead of white sugar, a little more 
l)eing required. Cool, and bake between two crusts. 

Blackberry Pie 

Pick over and wash one and one-half cups berries. Stew 
until soft with enough water to prevent burning. Add sugar 



468 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

to taste, and one-eighth teaspoon salt. Line plate with 
paste, put on a rim, fill with berries (which have been 
cooled) ; arrange six strips pastry acrosa the top, cut same 
width as rim ; put on an upper rim. Bake thirty minutes in 
moderate oven. 

Blueberry Pie 

2>^ cups berries J^ cup sugar 

Flour ^ teaspoon salt 

Line a deep plate with Plain Paste, fill with berries 
slightly dredged with flour; sprinkle with sugar and salt, 
cover, and bake forty-five to fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. For sweetening, some prefer to use one-third molas- 
ses, the remaining two-thirds to be sugar. Six green grapes 
(from which seeds have been removed) cut in small pieces 
much improve the flavor, particularly where huckleberries 
are used in place of blueberries. 

Cranberry Pie 

1^ cups cranberries /^ cup water 

% cup sugar 

Put ingredients in saucepan in order given, and cook ten 
minutes ; cool, and bake in one crust, with a rim, and strips 
across the top. 

Currant Pie 

1 cup currants J^ cup flour 

1 cup sugar 2 egg yolks 

2 tablespoons water 

Mix flour and sugar, add yolks of eggs slightly beaten 
and diluted with water. Wash currants, drain, remove 
stems, then measure ; add to first mixture and bake in one 
crust; cool, and cover with Meringue I. Cook in slow oven 
until delicately browned. 

Cream Pie 

Bake three crusts on separate pie plates. Put together 
with Cream Filling and dust over with i)owdered sugar. If 



PIES^ 469 

allowed to stand after filling for any length of time, the 
pastry will soften. 

Cnstard Pie 

2 eggs ^ teaspoon salt 

3 tablespoons sugar 1)^ cups milk 

Few gratings nutmeg 

Beat eggs slightly, add sugar, salt, and milk. Line plate 
with paste, and build up a fluted rim. Strain in the mix* 
ture and sprinkle witii few gratings nutmeg. Bake in quick 
oven at first to set rim, decrease the heat afterwards, as 
egg and milk in combination need to be cooked at low 
temperature. 

Date Pie 

2 cups milk 2 eggs 

}^ pound sugar dates ^ teaspoon salt 

Few gratings nutmeg 

Cook dates with milk twenty minutes in top of double 
boiler. Strain, and rub through sieve, then add eggs and 
salt. Bake same as Custard Pie. 

Lemon Pie I

Mince Pies 

Mince pies should be always baked with two crusts. 
For Thanksgiving and Christmas pies, Puff Paste is often 
used for rims and upper crusts, but is never satisfactory 
when used for under crusts.

cut squares apart with a sharp knife, and roll while warm in 
tubular or cornucopia shape. If squares become too brittle 
to roll, place in oven to soften. If rolled tubular shape, tie 
in bunches with narrow ribbon. These are very attractive, 
and may be served with sherbet, ice cream, or chocolate. If 
rolled cornucopia shape, they may be fllled with whipped 
cream just before sending to table. Colored wafers may be 
made from this mixture by adding leaf green or fruit red. 
If colored green, flavor with one-fourth teaspoon almond and 
three-fourths teaspoon vanilla. If colored pink, flavor with 
rose. Colored wafers must be baked in a very slow oven 
and turned frequently, otherwise they will not be of the 
uniform color that is desired.

CHAPTER XXXI 
CAKE 

THE mixing and baking of cake requires more care and 
judgment than any other branch of cookery ; notwith- 
standing, it seems the one most frequently attempted by the 
inexperienced. 

Two kinds of cake mixtures are considered : — 

L Without butter. Example : Sponge Cakes. 

n. With butter. Examples : Cup and Pound Cakes. 

In cake making (1) the best ingredients are essential ; (2) 
great care must be taken in measuring and combining in- 
gredients; (3) pans must be properly prepared; (4) oven 
heat must be regulated, and cake watched during baking. 

Best tub butter, fine granulated sugar, fresh eggs, and 
pastry flour are essentials for good cake. Coarse granulated 
sugar, bought by so many, if used in cake making, gives a 
coarse texture and hard crust. Pastry flour contains more 
starch and less gluten than bread flour, therefore makes a 
lighter, more tender cake. If bread flour must be used, 
allow two tablespoons less for each cup than the recipe calls 
for. Flour differs greatly in thickening properties; for 
this reason it is always well when using from a new bag to 
try a small cake, as the amount of flour given may not 
make the perfect loaf. In winter, cake may be made of less 
flour than in summer. 

Before attempting to mix cake, study How to Measure 
(p. 25) and How to Combine Ingredients (p. 26). 

Look at the fire, and replenish by sprinkling on a small 
quantity of coal if there is not suflScient heat to effect the 
bftking.

To Mix Sponge Cake. Separate yolks from whites of 
eggs. Beat yolks until thick and lemon -colored, using an 
egg-heater; add sugar gradually, and continue beating; 
then add flavoring. Beat whites until stiff and dry, — when 
they will fly from the beater, — and add to the first mixture. 
Mix and sift flour with salt, and cut and fold in at the last. 
If mixture is beaten after the addition of flour, much of the 
work, already done of enclosing a large amount of air will 
be undone by breaking air bubbles. These rules apply to a 
mixture where baking powder is not employed. 

To Mix Batter Cakes. An earthen bowl should always 
be used for mixing cake, and a wooden cake-spoon with slits 
lightens the labor. Measure dry ingredients, and mix and 
sift baking powder and spices, if used, with flour. Count 
out number of eggs required, breaking each separately that 
there may be no loss should a stale egg chance to be found 
in the number, separating yolks from whites if rule so speci- 
fies. Measure butter, then liquid. Having everything in 
readiness, the mixing may be quickly accomplished. If but- 
ter is very hard, by allowing it to stand a short time in a 
warm room it is measured and creamed much easier. If 
time cannot be allowed for this to be done, warm bowl by 
pouring in some hot water, letting stand one minute, then 
emptying and wiping dry. Avoid overheating bowl, as but- 
ter will become oily rather than creamy. Put butter in bowl, 
and cream by working with a wooden spoon until soft and 
of a creamy consistency ; then add sugar gradually, and con- 
tinue beating. Add yolks of eggs or whole eggs beaten 
until light, liquid, and flour mixed and sifted with baking 
powder; or liquid and flour may be added alternately. 
When yolks and whites of eggs are beaten separately, whites 
are usually added at the last, as is the case when whites of 
eggs alone are used. A cake can be made flne-grained only 
by long beating, although light and delicate with a small 
amount of beating. Never stir cake after the final beating, 
remembering that beating motion should always be the last 
used. Fruit, when added to cake, is usually floured to pre- 
vent its settling to the bottom. This is not necessary if it is 
added directly after the sugar, which is desirable in all dark 



CAKK 499 

cakes. If a light fruit cake is made, fruit added in this way 
discolors the loaf. Citron is first cut in thin slices, then in 
strips^ floured, and put in between layers of cake mixtures. 
Raisins are seeded and cut, rather than chopped. To seed 
raisins, wet tips of fingers in a cup of warm water. Then 
break skins with fingers or cut with a vegetable knife ; re- 
move seeds, and put in cup of water. This is better than 
covering raisins with warm water; if this be done, water 
clings to fruit, and when dredged with flour a pasty mass is 
formed on the outside. Washed currants, put up in pack- 
ages, are quite free from stems and foreign substances, and 
need only picking over and rolling in flour. Currants bought 
in bulk need thorough cleaning. First roll in flour, which 
helps to start dirt ; wash in cold water, drain, and spread to 
dry ; then roll again in flour before using. 

To Batter and Fill Pans. Grease pans with melted fat, 
applying the same with a butter bmsh. If butter is used, 
put in a small saucepan and place on back of range ; wiien 
melted, salt will settle to the bottom; butter is then called 
darified. Just before putting in mixture, dredge pans thor- 
oughly with flour, invert, and shake pan to remove all super- 
fluous flour, leaving only a thin coating which adheres to 
butter. This gives to cake a smooth under surface, which is 
especially desirable if cake is to be frosted. Pans may be 
lined with paper. If this is done, paper should just cover 
bottom of pan and project over sides. Then ends of pan 
and paper are buttered. 

In filling pans, have the mixture come well to the corners 
and sides of pans, leaving a slight depression in the centre, 
and when baked the cake will be perfectly flat on top. Cake 
pans should be filled nearly two-thirds full if cake is expected 
to rise to top of pan. 

To Bake Cake. The baking of cake is more critical than 
the mixing. Many a well- mixed cake has been spoiled in 
the baking. No oven thermometer has yet proved practical, 
and although many teachers of cookery have given oven 
tests, experience alone has proved the most reliable teacher. 
In baking cake, divide the time required into quarters. Dur- 
ing the first quarter the mixture should begin to rise ; second 



500 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

quarter, continue rising and begin to brown ; third quarter, 
continue browning ; fourth quarter, finish baking and shrink 
from pan. If oven is too hot, open check and raise back 
covers, or leave oven door ajar. It is sometimes^ necessary 
to cover cake with brown paper ; there is, however, danger 
of cake adhering to paper. Cake should be often looked at 
during baking, and providing oven door is opened and closed 
carefully, there is no danger of this causidg cake to fall. 
Cake should not be moved in oven until it has risen its full 
height ; after this it is usually desirable to move it that it 
may be evenly browned. Cake when done shrinks from the 
pan, and in most cases this is a sufficient test ; however, in 
pound cakes this rule does not apply. Pound' and rich fruit 
cakes are tested by pressing surface with tip of finger. If 
cake feels firm to touch and follows finger back into place, 
it is safe to remoye it from the oven. When baking cake 
arrange to have nothing else in the oven, and place loaf or 
loaves as near the centre of oven as possible. If placed close 
to fire box, one side of loaf is apt to become burned before 
sufficiently risen to turn. If cake is put in too slow an oven, 
it often rises over sides of pan and is of very coarse texture ; 
if put in too hot an oven, it browns on top before suflSciently 
risen, and in its attempt to rise breaks through the crust, 
thus making an unsightly loaf. Cake will also crack on top 
if too much flour has been used. The oven should be kept 
at as nearly uniform temperature as possible. Small and 
layer cakes require a hotter oven than loaf cakes. 

To Remove Cake From Pans. Remove cake from pans 
as soon as it comes from the oven, by inverting pan on a 
wire cake cooler, or on a board covered with a piece of old 
linen. If cake is inclined to stick, do not hurry it from pan, 
but loosen with knife around edges, and rest pan on its four 
sides successively J thus by its own weight cake may be 
helped out. 

To Frost Cake. Where cooked frostings are used, it 
makes but little difference whether they are spread on hot 
or cold cake. Where uncooked frostings are used, it is best 
to have the cake slightly warm, with the exception of Con- 
fectioners' Frosting, where boiling water is employed.

remove beater, and carefully cut and fold in flour mixed and 
sifted with salt. Bake one hour in a slow oven, in an angel 
cake pan or deep naiTow pan. 

Genuine sponge cake contains no rising properties, but is 
made light by the quantity of air beaten into both yolks and 
whites of eggs, and the expansion of that air in baking. It 
requires a slow oven. All so-called sponge cakes which have 
the addition of soda and cream of tartar or baking powder 
require same oven temperature as butter cakes. When 
failures are made in Sunshine and Angel Cake, they are 
usually traced to baking in too slow an oven, and removing 
from oven before thoroughly cooked.

To aiaze Cakes. Beat white of one egg slightly, and add 
one tablespoon powdered sugar. Apply with a brush to top 
and sides of cakes. After glazing, cakes should stand over 
night before dipping. 

To Dip Cakes. Melt fondant over hot water, and color 
and flavor as desired. Stir, to prevent crust from forming 
on top. Take cake to be dipped on a three-tined fork and 
lower in fondant three-fourths the depth of cake. Remove 
from fondant, invert, and slip from fork to a board. Deco- 
rate with ornamental frosting and nut meat, candied cherries, 
angelica, or candied violets. For small ornamented cakes, 
pound cake mixture is baked a little more than one inch 
thick in shallow pans, and when cool cut in squares, dia- 
monds, triangles, circles, crescents, etc. 

Marshmallcw Frosting 

Melt one cup white fondant; add the white of one egg 
beaten until stiff, and stir over the fire two minutes. Re- 
move from range, and beat until of right consistency to 
spread. Flavor with one-fourth teaspoon water white vanilla.

This is a most delicious frosting for chocolate cake, but will 
never spread perfectly smooth. 

Ornamental FroBting I 

2 cups auger Whites 3 eggs 

1 cup water )^ teaspoon tartaric acid 

Boil sugar and water until syrup when dropped from tip 
of spoon forms a long thread. Pour syrup gradually on 
beaten whites of eggs, beating constantly; then add acid 
and continue beating. When stiff enough to spread, put a 
thin coating over cake. Beat remaining frosting until cold 
and stiff enough to keep in shape after being forced through 
a pastry tube. After first coating on cake has hardened, 
cover with a thicker layer, and crease for cutting. If frost- 
ing is too stiff to spread smoothly, thin with a few drops of 
water. With a pastry bag and variety of tubes, cake may 
be ornamented as desired. 

Ornamental Froating II 

Whites 3 eggs 1 tablespoon lemon juice 

Confectioners' sugar, sifted 

Put eggs in a large bowl, add two tablespoons sugar, and 
beat three minutes, using a perforated wooden spoon. Re- 
peat until one and one-half cups sugar are used. Add 
lemon juice gradually, as mixture thickens. Continue add- 
ing sugar by spoonfuls, and beating until frosting is stiff 
enough to spread. This may be determined by taking up 
some of mixture on back of spoon, and with a case knife 
making a cut through mixture ; if knife makes a clean cut 
and frosting remains parted, it is of right consistency. 
Spread cake thinly with frosting ; when this has hardened, 
put on a thicker layer, having mixture somewhat stiffer than 
first coating, and then crease for cutting. To remaining 
frosting add enough more sugar, that frosting may keep in 
shape after being forced through a pastry bag and tube. 

With a pastry bag and variety of tubes, cake may be 
ornamented as desired.

FANCY CAKES AND CONFECTIONS 633 



CHAPTER XXXIII 
FAirCT CAKES AITD CONEECTIONS 

ALMOND paste for making macaroons and small fancy 
cakes may be bought of dealers who keep confectioners* 
supplies, although sometimes a resident baker or confectioner 
will sell a small quantity. Almond paste is put up in five- 
pound tin pails, and retails for one and one-half dollars per 
pail. During the cold weather it will keep after being opened 
for a long time. 

Macaroons 

}4 lb. almond paste Whites 3 eggs 

I % lt>- powdered sugar 

Work together almond paste and sugar on a smooth board 
or marble slab. Then add whites of eggs gradually, and 
work until mixture is perfectly smooth. Confectioners at 
first use the hand, afterwards a palette knife, which is not 
only of use for mixing but for keeping board clean. Shape, 
using a pastry bag and tube, on a tin sheet covered with 
buttered paper, one-half inch apart ; or drop mixture from 
tip of spoon in small piles. Macaroon mixture is stiff enough 
to hold its shape, but in baking spreads. Bake fifteen to 
twenty minutes in a slow oven. If liked soft, they should 
be slightly baked. After removing from oven, invert paper, 
and wet with a cloth wrung out of cold water, when macaroons 
will easily slip off. 

Almond Macaroons 

Sprinkle Macaroons, before baking, with almonds blanched 
and shredded, or chopped. 



684 BOSTON GOOKING-SGBOOIi COOK BOOK 

Crescents 

% lb. almond paste Almonds, blanched and 

2 ozs. confectioners' sngar finely chopped 

White 1 small egg 

Mix same as MacarooDS. Shape mixture, which is quite 
soft, in a long roll. Cut pieces from roll three-fourths inch 
long. Roll each separately in chopped nuts, at the same 
time shaping to form a crescent Bake twenty minutes on a 
buttered tin sheet in a slow oven. Cool, and frost with Con- 
fectioners' Frosting, made thin enough to apply with a brush, 
and flavored with lemon juice until quite acid. Other nuts 
may be used in place of almonds. 

Cinnamon Bars 

10 ozs. almond paste White 1 ^gg 

5 ozs. confectioners' sugar y^ teaspoon cinnamon 

Mix same as Macaroons. Dredge a board with sngar, 
knead mixture slightly, and shape in a long roll. Pat, and 
roll one-fourth inch thick, using a rolling-pin. After rolling 
the piece should be four inches wide. Spread with frosting 
made of white of one egg and two- thirds cup confectioners' 
sugar beaten together until stiff enough to spread. Cat in 
strips four inches long by three-fourths inch wide. This must 
be quickly done, as a crust soon forms over frosting. To 
accomplish this, use two knives, one placed through mixture 
where dividing line is to be made, and the other used to 
make a clean sharp cut on both sides of first knife. Knives 
should be kept clean by wiping on a damp cloth. Remove 
strips as soon as cut, to a tin sheet, greased with lard and 
then floured. Bake twenty minutes on centre grate in a 
slow oven. 

Horaeshoes 

Use Cinnamon Bar mixture. Cover with frosting colored 
with fruit red. Cut in strips six inches long by one-half 
inch wide. As soon as cut, shape quickly, at the same time 
carefully, in form of horseshoes. Bake same as Cinnamon 
Bars. When cool, make eight dots with chocolate frostmg 
to represent nails.

mixture clings to spoon, add whites of eggs, stir vigorously, 
and cook until mixture feels sticky when tried between the 
fingers. Spread in a wet pan, cover with wet paper, and 
chill on ice. Shape in small balls, first dipping hands in cold 
3(?ater: Bake twenty minutes in a slow oven on a tin sheet 
greased with white wax. 

Cocoanut Cakes II 

1 lb. fresh grated cocoanut ^ lb. sugar

Cook, shape, and bake same as Cocoanut Cakes I. 

Btuffed Datea I 

Make a cut the entire length of dates and remove stones. 
Fill cavities with castanea nuts, English walnuts, or blanched 
almonds, and shape in original form. Roll in granulated 
sugar. Pile in rows on a small plate covered with a doily. 
If castanea nuts are used, with a sharp knife cut off the 
brown skin which lies next to shell. 

Stuffed Dates 11 

Remove stones from dates and fill cavities with Neufchfttel 
cheese. 

Salted Almonda I 

Blanch one-fourth pound Jordan almonds and dry on a 
towel. Put one-third cup olive oil in a very small sauce- 
pan. When hot, put in one-fourth of the almonds and fry 
until delicately browned, stirring to keep almonds constantly 
in motion. Remove with a spoon or small skimmer, taking 
up as little oil as possible. Drain on brown paper and 
sprinkle with salt ; repeat until all are fried. It may be 



636 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

necessary to remove some of the salt by wiping nuts with a 
napkin. 

Salted Almonds II 

Prepare almonds as for Salted Almonds I. Fry in one- 
third cup fat, using half lard and half clarified butter or all 
eocoanut butter. Drain, and sprinkle with salt 

Salted Peanuts 

In buying peanuts for salting, get those which have not 
bQen roasted. Remove skins and fry same as Salted 
Almonds I or II. 

Salted Pecans 

Shelled pecans may be bought by the pound, which is 
much the best way when used for salting, as it is difficult to 
remove the nut meat without breaking. Fry same as salted 
Almonds I or II. Care must be taken that they do not re- 
main in fat too long; having a dark skin, color does not 
determine when they are sufficiently cooked. 

PMisian Sweets 

I lb. figs 1 lb. English walnut meat 

1 lb. dates Confectioners' sugar 

Pick over and remove stems from figs and stones from 
dates. Mix fruit with walnut meat, and force through a 
meat-chopper. Work, using the hands, on a board dretlgcd 
with confectioners' sugar, until well blended. Roll to one- 
fourth inch thickness, using confectioners' sugar for dredg- 
ing board and pin. Shape with a small round cutter, first 
dipped in sugar, or cut with a sharp knife in three-fourth 
inch squares. Roll each piece in confectioners' sugar, and 
shake to remove supei*fluous sugai\ Pack in layers in a tin 
box, putting paper between each layer. These confections 
may be used at dinner in place of bonbons or ginger chips. 
A combination of nut meat (walnut, almond, and filbert) 
may be used in equal proportions.

with sugar. 

Molasses Candy 

2 cups Porto Rico molasses 3 tablespoons butter 
% cup sugar 1 tablespoon vinegar 

An iron kettle with a rounding bottom (Scotch kettle) or 
copper kettle is best for candy making. If one has no cop- 
per kettle, a granite kettle is best for sugar candies. 

Put butter in kettle, place oyer fire, and when melted, add 
molasses and sugar. Stir until sugar is dissolved. During 
the first of the boiling stirring is unnecessary, but when 
nearly cooked, it should be constantly stirred. Boil until, 
when tried in cold water, mixture will become brittle. Add 
vinegar just before taking from fire. Pour into a well but- 
tered pan. When cool enough to handle, pull until porous 
and light-colored, allowing candy to come in contact with 
tips of fingers and thumbs, not to be squeezed in the hand. 
Cut in small pieces, using large shears or a sharp knife, and 
then arrange on slightly buttered plates to cool.

colored. Shape on a floured board, having strip wide enough 
to enclose a roll of fondant one inch in diameter. Place 
fondant on candy, bring edges of candy together, and press 
firmly over fondant. With both hands pull candy into a 
long strip. Cut in small pieces ; each piece will consist of 
fondant encircled with molasses candy. Care must be taken 
that candy is not cooked too long, as it should be soft rather 
than brittle. 

Vineg;ar Candy

Put sugar in a saucepan, place on range, and stir con- 
stantly until melted ; add almonds, and pour on an oiled 
marble. Fold mixture as it spreads with a broad-bladed 
knife,, keeping it constantly in motion. Divide in four 
parts, and as soon as cool enough to handle shape in long 
rolls about one-third inch in diameter, keeping rolls in 
motion until almost cold. Wlien cold, snap in pieces one 
and one-half inches long. This is done by holding roll 
at point to be snapped over the sharp edge of a broad- 
bladed knife and snapping. Melt confectioners' chocolate 
over hot water, beat with a fork until ligh^ and smooth, 
and when slightly cooled dip pieces in chocolate and with 
a two-tin ed fork or bonbon dipper remove from chocolate 
to oiled paper, drawing dipper through top of each the en- 
tire length, thus leaving a ridge. Chocolate best adapted 
for dipping bonbons and confections must be bought where 
confectioners' supplies are kept.

BOILED SXrOAE FOE COVFECTIOVS 

Eleven tests are considered for boiling sugar : — 

Small thread, 215° F. The feather, 232o 

Large thread, 217° Soft ball, 238o 

Pearl, 220° Hardball, 24So 

Large pearl, 222° Small crack, 290° 

The blow, 230° Crack, 310° 

Caramel, 350° 

Fondant, the basis of all French, candy, is made of sagar 
and water boiled together (with a small quantity of cream 
of tartar to prevent sugar from granulating) to soft ball, 238° 
F. The professional confectioner is able to decide when 
syrup has boiled to the right temperature by sound while 
boiling, and by testing in cold water; these tests at first 
seem somewhat difficult to the amateur, but only a little 
experience is necessary to make fondant successfully. A 
sugar thermometer is often employed, and proves yaluable, 
as by its use one need not exercise his judgment. 

"Wliite Fondant 

2)4 lbs. sugar 1)4 cups hot water 

J^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put ingredients into a smooth granite stewpan. Stir, 
place on range, and heat gradually to boiling point Boil 
without stirring until, when tried in cold water, a soft ball 
may be formed that will just keep in shape, which is 238° F. 
After a few minutes' boiling, sugar will adhere to sides of 
kettle ; this should be washed off with the hand first 
dipped in cold water. Have a pan of cold water near at 



CONFECTIONS 545 

hand, dip hand in cold water, then quickly wash o£P a small 
part of the sugar with tips of fingers, and repeat until all 
sugar adhering to side of saucepan is removed. If this is 
quickly done, there is no danger of burning the fingers. 
Pour slowly on a slightly oiled marble slab. Let stand a few 
minutes to cool, but not long enough to become hard around 
the edge. Scrape fondant with chopping knife to one end of 
marble, and work with a wooden spatula until white and 
creamy. It will quickly change from this consistency, and 
begin to lump, when it should be kneaded with the hands 
until perfectly smooth. 

Put into a bowl, cover with oiled paper to exclude air, 
that a crust may not form on top, and let stand twenty-four 
hours. A large oiled platter and wooden spoon may be used 
in place of marble slab and spatula. Always make fondant 
on a clear day, as a damp, heavy atmosphere has an unfa- 
vorable effect on the boiling of sugar. 

Coffee Fondant 

2>^ lbs. sugar J^' cup ground coffee 

1 j^ cups cold water )/^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put water and coffee in saucepan, and heat to boiling- 
point Strain through double cheese-cloth ; then add sugar 
and cntam of tartar. Boil, and work same as White Fondant. 

Maple Fondant 

\)^ lbs. maple sugar .1 cup hot water 

1)^ lbs. sugar J^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Break maple sugar in pieces and add to remaining ingre- 
dients. Boil, and work same as White Fondant. 

Bonbons 

The centres of bonbons are made of fondant shaped in 
small balls. If White Fondant is used, flavor as desired, — 
vanilla being usually preferred. For cocoanut centres, work 
as much shredded coacoanut as possible into a small quantity 
of fondant; for nut centres, surround pieces of nut meat with 
fondant, using just enough to cover. French candied cher- 

j»5 



546 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

ries are often used in this way. Allow balls to stand over 
night, and dip the following day. 

To Dip Bonbons. Put fondant in saucepan, and melt 
over hot water; color and flavor as desired. In coloring 
fondant, dip a small wooden skewer in coloring paste, take 
up a small quantity, and dip skewer in fondant. If care is 
not taken, the color is apt to be too intense. During dipping, 
keep fondant over hot water that it may be kept of right 
consistency. For dipping, use a two-tined fork or confec- 
tioners' bonbon dipper. Drop centres in fondant one at a 
time, stir until covered, remove from fondant, put on oiled 
paper, and bring end of dipper over the top of bonbon, thas 
leaving a tail-piece which shows that bonbons have been 
hand dipped. Stir fondant between dippings to prevent a 
crust from forming. 

Cream Mints 

Melt fondant over hot water, flavor with a few drops of 
oil of peppermint, wintergreen, clove, cinnamon, or orange, 
and color if desired. Drop from tip of spoon on oiled paper. 
Confectioners use rubber moulds for shaping cream mints; 
but these are expensive for home use, unless one is to make 
mints in large quantities. 

Cream Nut Bars 

Melt fondant and flavor, stir in any kind of nut meat, cut 
in pieces. Turn in an oiled pan, cool, and cut in bars with 
a sharp knife. Maple Fondant is delicious with nuts. 

Dipped "Walnuts 

Melt fondant and flavor. Dip halves of walnuts as bon- 
bon centres are dipped. Halves of pecan or whole blanched 
almonds may be similarly dipped. 

Tutti-Prutti Candy 

Fill an oiled border -mould with three layers of melted 
fondant. Have bottom layer maple, well mixed with Eng- 
lish walnut meat; the second layer colored pink, flavored 



CONFBCTION8 547 

with rose, and mixed with candied cherries cut in quarters 
and figs finely chopped ; the third layer white, flavored with 
vanilla, mixed with nuts, candied cherries cut in quarters, 
and candied pineapple cut in small pieces. Cover mould 
with oiled paper, and let stand over night. Remove from 
mould, and' place on a plate covered with a lace paper 
napkin. Fill centre with Bonbons and Glace Nuts. 

01ac6 Nuts 
2 cups sugar 1 cup boiling water 

3^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put ingredients in a smooth saucepan, stir, place on 
range, and heat to boiling-point. Boil without stirring until 
syrup begins to discolor, which is 310° F. Wash off sugar 
which adheres to sides of saucepan, as in making fondant. 
Remove saucepan from fire, and place in larger pan of cold 
water to instantly stop boiling. Remove from cold water 
and place in a saucepan of hot water during dipping. Take 
nuts separately on a long pin, dip in syrup to cover, remove 
from syrup, and place on oiled paper. 

Qlac6 Fruits 

For Glac^ Fruits, grapes, strawberries, sections of man- 
darins and oranges, and candied cherries are most commonly 
used. Take grapes separately from clusters, leaving a short 
stem on each grape. Dip in syrup made as for Glace Nuts, 
holding by stem with pincers. Remove to oiled paper. Glace 
fruits keep but a day, and should only be attempted in cold 
and clear weather. 

Candied Orange Peel 

Remove peel from four thin-skinned oranges in quarters. 
Cover with cold water, bring to boiling-point, and cook 
slowly until soft Drain, remove white portion, using a 
spoon, and cut yellow portion in thin strips, using scissors. 
Boil one-half cup water and one cup sugar until syrup will 
thread when dropped from tip of spoon. Cook strips in 
syrup five minutes, drain, and coat with fine granulated 
sugar.

2 lbs. sugar 2 cups boiling water 

)^ teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put ingredients in a smooth saacepan. Boil without stir- 
ring until syrup begins to discolor, which is SOO'* F. Wash 
off sugar which adheres to sides of saucepan, as in making 
fondant. Remove saucepan from fire, and place in a larger 
pan of cold water to instantly stop boiling. Remove from 
cold water, and place in saucepan of hot water. Place two 
broomstick-handles over backs of chairs, and spread paper 
on the floor under them. When syrup is slightly cooled, 
put dipper in syrup, remove from syrup, and shake quickly 
back and forth over broomhandles. Carefully take off spun 
sugar as soon as formed, and shape in nests, or pile lightly 
on a cold dish. Syrup may be colored if desired. Spun 
Sugar is served around bricks or moulds of frozen creams 
and ices. 

Dippers for spinning sugar are made of coarse wires; 
about twenty wires, ten inches long, are put in a bundle, 
and fastened with wire coiled round and round to form a 
handle.

CHAPTER XXXIV 
SANDWICHES AND CANAPES 

IN preparing bread for sandwiches, cut slices as thinly as 
possible, and remove crusts. If butter is used, cream 
the butter, and spread bread before cutting from loaf. 
Spread half the slices witli mixture to be used for filling, 
cover with remaining pieces, and cut in squares, oblongs, or 
triangles. If sandwiches are shaped with round or fancy 
cutters, bread should be shaped before spreading, that there 
may be no waste of butter. Sandwiches which are prepared 
several hours before serving-time may be kept fresh and 
moist by wrapping in a napkin wrung as dry as possible out 
of hot water, and keeping in a cool place. Paraffine paper 
is often used for the same purpose. Bread for sandwiches 
cuts better when a day old. Serve sandwiches piled on a 
plate covered with a doily. 

Rolled Bread 

Cut fresh bread, while still warm, in as thin slices as pos- 
sible, using a very sharp knife. Spread evenly with butter 
which has been creamed. Roll slices separately, and tie 
each with baby ribbon. 

Bread and Butter Folds 

Remove end slice from bread. Spread end of loaf spar- 
ingly and evenly with butter which has been creamed. Cut 
off as thin a slice as possible. Repeat until the number of 
slices required are prepared. Remove crusts, put together 
in pairs, and cut in squares, oblongs, or triangles. Use 
white, entire wheat, Graham, or brown bread. Three layer 
sandwiches are attractive when made of entire wheat bread 
between white slices.

CHAPTER XXXV 
BECIPES FOB TH£ CHAFINO-DISH 

THE chafing-dish, which, within the last few years, has 
gained so much favor, is by no means a utensil of 
modern invention, as its history may be traced to the time 
of Louis XIV. It finds its place on the breakfast table, 
when the eggs may be cooked to suit the most fastidious; 
on the luncheon table, when a dainty hot dish may be pre- 
pared to serve in place of the so-oft seen cold meat; but it 
is made of greatest use for the cooking of late suppers, and 
always seems to accompany hospitality and good cheer. 

It is appreciated and enjoyed by the housekeeper who 
does her own work, or has hut one maid, as well as by the 
society girl who, by its use, first gains a taste for the art of 
cooking. The simple tin chafing-dishes may be bought for 
as small a sum as ninety cents, while the elaborate silver 
ones command as high a price as one hundred dollars. Very 
attractive dishes are made of granite ware, nickel, or copper. 
The latest patterns have the lamp with a screw adjustment 
to regulate the flame, and a metal tray on which to set dish- 
that it may be moved if necessary while hot, without danger 
of burnt fingers, and that it may not injure the polished 
table. 

A chafing-dish has two pans, the under one for holding 
hot water, the upper one with long handle for holding food 
to be cooked. A blazer differs from a chafing-dish, inas- 
much as it has no hot-water pan. 

Wood alcohol, which is much lower in price than high-proof 
spirits, is generally used in chafing-dishes. 

The Davy Toaster may be used over the chafing-dish for 
toasting bread and broiling.

FRUITS: F&BSH, PJi£SfiRV£D, AND CANNED 567 



CHAPTER XXXVI 
FETJITS: FBESH, PBESERVED, AND CAITirED 

FRUITS are usually at their best when served ripe and 
in season; however, a few cannot be taken in their 
raw state, and still others are rendered more easy of diges- 
tion by cooking. The methods employed are stewing and 
baking. Fruit should be cooked in earthen or granite ware 
utensils, and silver or wooden spoons should be employed 
for stirring. It must be remembered that all fruits contain 
one or more acids, and when exposed to air and brought in 
contact with an iron or tin surface, a poisonous compound 
may be formed. 

How to Prepare Strawberries for Senring 

1. Pick over strawberries, place in colander, pour over 
cold water, drain thoroughly, hull, and turn into dish. Serve 
with powdered sugar and cream. 

2. Pick over selected strawberries, place in colander, pour 
over cold water, and drain thoroughly. Press powdered 
sugar into cordial glasses. Remove from glasses on centres 
of fruit plates. Arrange twelve berries around each mound 
of sugar. Berries served in this way should not be 
hulled. 

How to Prepare Cantaloupes and Muskmelons for Serving 

Canteloupes and muskmelons should be very ripe and 
thoroughly chilled in ice box before being prepared for 
serving. Wipe melons, — if small, cut in halves lengthwise ; if 
larger, cut in sections, and remove seeds and stringy portion. 
If one-half is served as a portion, put in cavity one table- 
spoon crashed ice. Serve with salt or powdered sugar.

How to Prepare Orapea for Serving 

Put bunches in colander and pour over cold water, drain, 
chill, and arrange on serving dish. Imperfect grapes, as 
well as those under-ripe or over-rjpe, should be removed. 
Garnish with grape leaves, if at hand. 

Ways of Preparing Oranges for Serving 

1. Wipe orange and cut in halves crosswise. Place one- 
half on a fruit plate, having an orange spoon or teaspoon on 
plate at right of fruit. 

2. Peel an orange and remove as much of the white por- 
tion as possible. Remove pulp by sections, which may be 
accomplished by using a sharp knife and cutting pulp from 
tough portion first on one side of section, then on the other. 
Should there be any white portion of skin remaining on pulp 
it should be cut off. Arrange sections on glass dish or fruit 
plate. If the orange is a seeded one, remove seeds. 

3. Remove peel from an orange in such a way that there 
remains a one-half inch band of peel equal distance from 
stem and blossom end. Cut band, separate sections, and 
arrange around a mould of sugar. 

How to Prepare Qrape Froit for Serving 

Wipe grape fruit and cut in halves crosswise. With a 
small, sharp-pointed knife make a cut separating pulp from 
skin around entire circumference ; then make cuts separating 
pulp from tough portion which divides fruit into sections. 
Remove tough portion in one piece, which may be accom- 
plished by one cutting with scissors at stem or blossom end 
close to skin. Sprinkle fruit pulp left in grape fruit skin 
generously with sugar. Let stand ten minutes, and serve 
very cold. Place on fruit plate and garnish with a candied 
cherry. 

Qrape Fruit with Sherry 

Prepare grape fruit for serving, add to each portion one 
tablespoon Sherry wine, and let stand one hour in ice box or 
cold place. 



FBUITS: FRESH, PKESERVBD, AND CANNED 669 

Orape Fruit with Apricot Brandy 

Prepare grape fruit for serving and add to each portion 
one-half tablespoon apricot brandy. 

Qrape Fmit with Sloe GMn 

Prepare grape fruit for serving and add to each portion 
oue-half tablespoon sloe gin. 

Fruit CocktaU 

Remove pulp from grape fruit, and mix with shredded 
pineapple, bananas cut in slices and slices cut in quarters^ 
and strawberries cut in halves, using half as much pine- 
apple and banana as grape fruit, and allowing four straw- 
berries to each serve. There should be two cups fruit. 
Pour over a dressing made of one-third cup Sherry wine, 
three tablespoons apricot brandy, one-half cup sugar, and a 
few grains salt. Chill thoroughly, serve in double cocktail 
glasses, and garnish with candied cherries and leaves. 

Baked Apples 

Wipe and core sour apples. Put in a baking-dish, and fill 
cavities with sugar and spice. Allow one- half cup sugar 
and one-fourth teaspoon cinnamon or nutmeg to eight apples. 
If nutmeg is used, a few drops lemon juice and few gratings 
from rind of lemon to each apple is an improvement. Cover 
bottom of dish with boiling water^ and bake in a hot oven 
until soft, basting often with syrup in dish. Serve hot or 
cold with cream. Many prefer to pare apples before bak- 
ing. When this is done, core before paring, that fruit may 
keep in shape. In the fall, when apples are at their best, 
do not add spices to apples, as their flavor cannot be im- 
proved; but towards spring they become somewhat taste- 
less, and spice is an improvement. 

Baked Sweet Apples 

Wipe and core eight sweet apples. Put in a baking-dish, 
and fill cavities with sugar, allowing one-third cup, or 
sweeten with molasses. Add two-thirds cup boiling water. 



570 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

Cover, and bake three hours in a slow oven, adding more 
water if necessary. 

Apple Sanoe 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour apples. Make a 
syrup by boiling seven minutes one cup sugar and one cap 
water with thin shaving from rind of a lemon. Remove 
lemon, add enough apples to cover bottom of saucepan, 
watch carefully during cooking, and remove as soon as soft 
Continue until all are cooked. Strain remaining syrup over 
apples. 

Spiced Apple Sauce 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight sour apples. Put in 
a saucepan, sprinkle with one cup sugar, add eight cloves, 
and enough water to prevent apples from burning. Cook to 
a mush, stirring occasionally. 

Apple Qinger 

Wipe, quarter, core, pare, and chop sour apples; there 
should be two and one-half pounds. Put in a stewpaD 
and add one and one-half pounds light brown sugar, juice 
and rind of one and one-half lemons, one-half ounce ginger 
root, a few grains salt, and enough water to prevent apples 
from burning. Cover, and cook slowly four hours, adding 
water as necessary. Apple Ginger may be kept for several 
weeks. 

Apple Porcupine 

Make a syrup by boiling eight minutes one and one-half 
cups sugs^r and one and one-half cups water. Wipe, core, 
and pare eight apples. Put apples in syrup as soon as pared, 
that they may not discolor. Cook until soft, occasionally 
skimming syrup during cooking. Apples cook better cov- 
ered with the syrup; therefore it is better to use a deep 
saucepan and have two cookings. Drain apples from syrnp^ 
cool, fill cavities with jelly, marmalade, or preserved fruit, 
and stick apples with almonds blanched and split in halves 
lengthwise. Serve with Cream Sauce I.

Baked Bananas I 

Remove skins from six bananas and cut in halves length 
wise. Put in a shallow granite pan or on an old platter. 
Mix two tablespoons melted butter, one- third cup sugar, 
and two tablespoons lemon juice. Baste bananas with one- 
half the mixture. Bake twenty minutes in a slow oven, 
basting during baking with remaining mixture. 

Baked Bananae II 

Arrange bananas in a shallow pan, cover, and bake until 
skins become very dark in color. Remove from skins, and 
serve hot sprinkled with sugar. 

Sauted Bananas 

Remove skins from bananas, cut in halves lengthwise, and 
again cut in halves crosswise. Dredge with flour, and saute 
in clarified butter. Drain, and sprinkle with powdered 
sugar. 

Baked Peaches 

Peel, cut in halves, and remove stones from six peaches. 
Place in a shallow granite pan. Fill each cavity with one 
teaspoon sugar, one-half teaspoon butter, few drops lemon 
juice, and a slight grating nutmeg. Cook twenty minutes, 
and serve on circular pieces of buttered dry toast. 

Baked Pears 

Wipe, quarter, and core pears. Put in a deep pudding- 
dish, sprinkle with sugar or add a small quantity of molas- 
ses, then add water to prevent pears from burning. Cover, 
and cook two or three hours in a very slow oven. Small 
pears may be baked whole. Seckel pears are delicious 
when baked. 

Baked Quinces 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare eight quinces. Put in a 
baking dish, sprinkle with three-fourths cup sugar, add one 
and one-half cups water, cover, and cook until soft in a slow 
oven. Quinces require a long time for cooking.

Cranberry Sauoe 

Pick over and wash three caps cranberries. Pat in a 
stewpan, add one and one-fourth cups sugar and one cup 
boiling water. Cover, and boil ten minutes. Care must be 
taken that they do not boil over. Skim and cool. 

Cranberry Jelly 

Pick over and wash four cups cranberries. Put in a stew- 
pan with one cup boiling wat«r, and boil twenty minutes. 
Rub through a sieve, add two cups sugar, and cook five 
minutes. Turn into a mould or glasses. 

Stewed Prunes 

Wash and pick over prunes. Put in a saucepan, cover 
with cold water, and soak two hours ; then cook until soft 
in same water. When nearly cooked, add sugar or molasses 
to sweeten. Many prefer the addition of a small quantity of 
lemon juice. 

Rhubarb Sauce 

Peel and cut rhubarb in one-inch pieces. Put in a sauce- 
pan, sprinkle generously with sugar, and add enough water 
to prevent rhubarb from burning. Rhubarb contains such a 
large percentage of water that but little additional water is 
needed. Cook until soft. If rhubarb is covered with boU- 
ing water, allowed to stand five minutes, then drained and 
cooked, less sugar will be required. Rhubarb is sometimes 
baked in an earthen pudding-dish. If baked slowly for a 
long time it has a rich red color. 



JELLIES 

Jellies are made of cooked fruit juice and sugar, in nearly 
all cases the proportions being equal. Where failures occnr, 
they may usually be traced to the use of too ripe fruit

ually to boiling-point. Remove glasses, and drain. Place 
glasses while filling on a cloth wrung out of hot water. 

To Cover Jelly aiasses. Cut letter paper in circular 
pieces just to fit in top of glasses. Dip in brandy, and cover 
jelly. Put on tin covers or circular pieces of paper cut 
larger than the glasses, and fastened securely over the edge 
with mucilage. Some prefer to cover jelly with melted 
paraffine then to adjust covers. 

To Make a Jelly Bag. Fold two opposite corners of a piece 
of cotton and wool flannel three-fourths yard long. Sew up 
in the form of a cornucopia, rounding at the end. Fell the 
seam to make more secure. Bind the top with tape, and fur- 
nish with two or three heavy loops by which it may be hung. 

Apple Jelly 

Wipe apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and cut in 
quarters. Put in a granite or porcelain-lined preserving ket- 
tle, and add cold water to come nearly to top of apples. 
Cover, and cook slowly until apples are soft; mash, and 
drain through a coarse sieve. Avoid squeezing apples, which 
makes jelly cloudy. Then allow juice to drip through a 
double thickness of cheese-cloth or a jelly bag. Boil twenty 
minutes, and add an equal quantity of heated sugar ; boil 
five minutes, skim, and turn in glasses. Put in a sunny win- 
dow, and let stand twenty-four hours. Cover, and keep in a 
cool, dry place. Porter apples make a delicious flavored 
jelh'. If apples are pared, a much lighter jelly may be 
made. Gravenstein apples make a very spicy jelly. 

To Heat Sugar. Put in a granite dish, place in oven, 
leaving oven door ajar, and stir occasionally. 

Quince Jelly 

Follow recipe for Apple Jelly, using quinces in place of 
apples, and removing seeds from fruit. Quince parings are 
often used for jelly, the better part of the fruit being used 
for canning. 

Crab Apple Jelly

Currant Jelly 

Currants are in the best condition for making jelly between 
June twenty-eighth and July tiiird, and should not be picked 
directly after a rain. Cherry currants make the best jelly. 
Equal proportions of red and white currants are considered 
desirable, and make a lighter colored jolly. 

Pick over currants, but do not remove stems ; wash and 
drain. Mash a few in the bottom of a preserving kettle, 
using a wooden potato masher ; so continue until berries are 
used. Cook slowly until currants look white. Strain through 
a course strainer, then allow juice to drop through a double 
thickness of clieese-cloth or a jelly bag. Measure, bring to 
boiling-point, and boil five minutes ; add an equal measure 
of heated sugar, boil three minutes, skim, and pour into 
glasses. Place in a sunny window, and let stand twenty- 
four hours. Cover, and keep in a cool, dry place. 

Currant and Raspberry Jelly 

Follow recipe for Currant Jelly, using equal parts of cur- 
rants and raspberries. 

Blackberry Jelly 

Follow recipe for Currant Jelly, using blackberries in place 
of currants. 

Raspberry Jelly 

Follow recipe for Currant Jelly, using raspberries in place 
of currants. Raspberry Jelly is the most critical to make, 
and should not be attempted if fruit is thoroughly ripe, or if 
it has been long picked. 

Barberry Jelly 

Barberry Jelly is firmer and of better color if made from 
fruit picked before the frost comes, while some of the berries 
are still green. Make same as Currant Jelly, allowing one 
cup water to one peck barberries. 

Grape Jelly 

Grapes should be picked over, washed, and stems removed 
before putting into a preserving kettle. Heat to boiling-

Separate pulp from skins. Put pulp in preserving kettle* 
Heat to boiling-point, and cook slowly until seeds separate 
from pulp ; then rub through a hair sieve. Return to kettle 
with skins, add an equal measure of sugar, and cook slowly 
thirty minutes, occasionally stirring to prevent burning. Put 
in a stone jar or tumblers. 

Quince Marmalade 

Wipe quinces, remove blossom ends, cut in quarters, re- 
move seeds ; then cut in small pieces. Put into a preserving 
kettle, and add enough water to nearly cover. Cook slowly

its measure of heated sugar. Cook slowly twenty minutes, 
stirring occasionally to prevent burning. Put in tumblers. 

Orange Marmalade I 

Select sour, smooth-skinned oranges. Weigh oranges, 
and allow three-fourths their weight in cut sugar. Remove 
peel from oranges in quarters. Cook peel until soft in 
enough boiling water to cover; drain, remove white part 
from peel by scraping it with a spoon. Cut thin yellow rind 
in stnps, using a pair of scissors. This is more quickly 
accomplished by cutting through two or three pieces at a 
time. Divide oranges in sections, remove seeds and tough 
part of the skin. Put into a preserving kettle and heat to 
boiling-point, add sugar gradually, and cook slowly one 
hour; add rind, and cook one hour longer. Turn into 
glasses.

inch pieces. Heat to boiling-point, and boil one-half hour; 
then add four pounds cut sugar and cut rind. Cook slowly 
two hours. Turn into glasses. 

Quince Honey 

Pare and grate five large quinces. To one pint boiling 
water add five pounds sugar. Stir over fire until sugar is 
dissolved, add quince, and cook fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Turn into glasses. When cold it should be about the color 
and consistency of honey. 

CAiornro and PRESEETnro 

Preserving fruit is cooking it with from three-fourths to its 
whole weight of sugar. By so doing, much of the natural 
flavor of the fruit is destroyed ; therefore canning is usually 
preferred to preser\ang. 

Canning fruit is presemng sterilized fruit in sterilized air- 
tight jars, the sugar being added to give sweetness. Fruits 
may be canned without sugar if perfectly sterilized, that is, 
freed from all germ life. 

Directions for Canning 

Fruit for canning should be fresh, firm, of good quality, 
and not over-ripe ; if over-ripe, some of the spores may sur- 
vive the boiling, then fermentation will take place in a short 
time. 

For canning fruit, allow one-third its weight in sugar, 
and two and one-half to three cups water to each pound of 
sugar. Boil sugar and water ten minutes to make a thin 

37 



678 BOST^ON COOKING-BOHOOL COOK BOOK 

syrup ; then cook a small quantity of the fruit at a time in 
the syrup ; by so doing, fruit may be kept in perfect shape. 
Hard fruits, like pineapple and quince, are cooked in boiling 
water until nearly soft, then put in syrup to finish cooking. 
Sterilized jars are then filled with fruit, and enough syrup 
added to overflow jars. If there is not sufficient syrup, add 
boiling water, as jars must be filled to overflow. Introduce 
a spoon between fruit and jar, that air bubbles may rise to 
the top and break ; then quickly put on rubbers and screw 
on sterilized covers. Let stand until cold, again screw cov- 
ers, being sure this time that jars are air-tight. While filling 
jars, place them on a cloth wrung out of hot water. 

To Sterilize Jars 

Wash jars and fill with cold water. Set in a kettle on a 
trivet, and surround with cold water. Heat gradually to 
boiling-point, remove from water, empty, and fill while hot 
Put covers in hot water and let stand five minutes. Dip rub- 
ber bands in hot water, but do not allow them to stand. 
New rubbers should be used each season, and care must be 
taken that rims of covers are not bent, as jars caynot then 
be hermetically sealed. 

Canned Porter Apples 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare Porter apples, then weigh. 
Make a syrup by boiling for ten minutes one-third their 
weight in sugar with water, allowing two and one-half 
cups to each pound of sugar. Cook apples in syrup until 
soft, doing a few at a time. Fill jars, following Directions 
for Canning. 

Canned Peaches 

Wipe peaches and put in boiling water, allowing them to 
stand just long enough to easily loosen skins. Remove skins 
and cook fruit at once, that it may not discolor, following 
Directions for Canning. Some prefer to pare peaches, 
sprinkle with sugar, and let stand over night. In morning 
drain, add water to fruit syrup, bring to boiling-point, and 
then cook fruit. Peaches may be cut in halves, or smaller 
pieces if desired. 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 679 

Canned Pears 

Wipe and pare fruit. Cook whole with stems left on, or 
remove stems, cut in quarters, and core. Follow Directions 
for Canning. A small piece of ginger root or a few slicings 
of lemon rind may be cooked with syrup. Bartlett pears are 
the best for canning. 

Canned Pineapples 

Eemove skin and eyes from pineapples ; then cut in half- 
inch slices, and slices in cubes, at the same time discarding 
the core. Follow Directions for Canning. Pineapples may be 
shredded and cooked in one-half their weight of sugar with- 
out water, and then put in jars. When put up in this way 
they are useful for the making of sherbets and fancy des- 
serts. 

Canned Quinces 

Wipe, quarter, core, and pare quinces. Follow Directions 
for Canning. Quinces may be cooked with an equal weight 
of sweet apples wiped, quartered, cored, and paired ; in this 
case use no extra sugar for apples. 

Canned Cherries 

Use lai^e white or red cherries. Wash, remove stems, 
then follow Durections for Canning. 

Canned Huckleberries 

Pick over and wash berries, then put in a preserving ket- 
tle with a small quantity of water to prevent berries from 
burning. Cook until soft, stirring occasionally, and put 
in jars. No sugar is required, but a sprinkling of salt is 
an agreeable addition. 

Canned Rhubarb 

Pare rhubarb and cut in one-inch pieces. Pack in a jar, 
put under cold water faucet, and let water run twenty min- 
utes, then screw on cover. Rhubarb canned in this way has 
often been known to keep a year.

jars, following directions given. 

Damson Preserves 

Wipe damsons with a piece of cheese-cloth wrung out 
of cold water, and prick each fruit Ave or six times, using 
a large needle; then weigh. Make a syrup by boiling three- 
fourths their weight in sugar with water, allowing one cup to 
each pound of sugar. As soon as syrup reaches boiling- 
point, skim, and add plums, a few at a time, that fruit may 
better keep in shape during cooking. Cook until soft It is 
well to use two kettles, that work may be more quickly done, 
and syrup need not cook too long a time. Put into glass or 
stone jars. 

Strawberry Preserves 

Pick over, wash, drain, and hull strawberries ; then weigh. 
Fill glass jars with berries. Make a syrup same as for 
Damson Preserve, cooking the syrup fifteen minutes. Add 
syrup to overflow jars ; let stand fifteen minutes, when fruit 
will have shrunk, and more fruit must be added to fill jars. 
Screw on covers, put on a trivet in a kettle of cold water, 
heat water to boiling-point, and keep just below boiling-point 
one hour. 

Raspberries may be preserved in the same way.

HELPFUL HUrXS FOB THE YOUHO HOITSEXEEPEB 

To Scald Biilk. Put in top of double boiler, having 
water boiling in under part. Cover, and let stand on top of 
range until milk around edge of double boiler has a bead- 
like appearance. 

For Buttered Cracker Crambs, allow from one-fonrth to 
one- third cup melted butter to each cup of crumbs. Stir 
lightly with a fork in mixing, that crumbs may be evenly 
coated and light rather than compact. 

To Cream Butter. Put in a bowl and work with a wooden 
spoon until soft and of creamy consistency. Should butter- 
milk exude from butter it should be poured off. 

To Extract Juice from Onion. Cut a slice from root end 
of onion, draw back the skin, and press onion on a coarse 
grater, working with a rotary motion. 

To Chop Parsley. Remove leaves from parsley. ■ If 

parsley is wet. first dry in a towel. Gather parsley between 
thumb and fingers and press compactly. With a sharp 
vegetable knife cut through and through. Again gather in 
fingers and recut, so continuing until parsley is finely cut. 

To Caramelize Sugar. Put in a smooth granite saucei)an 
or omelet pan, place over hot part of range, and stir con- 
stantly until melted and of the color of maple syrup. Care 
must be taken to prevent sugar from adhering to sides of 
pan or spoon. 

To Make Caramel. Continue the caramelization of sugar 
until syrup is quite brown and a whitish smoke arises from 



HELPFUL HINTS FOR THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 587 

it Add an equal quantity of boiling water, and simmer 
until of the consistency of a thick syrup. Of use in coloring 
soups, sauces, etc. 

Acidulated VTater is water to which vinegar or lemon 
juice is added One tablespoon of the acid is allowed to 
one quart water. 

To Blanch Almonds. Cover Jordan almonds with boiling 
water and let stand two minutes ; drain, put into cold water, 
and rub off the skins. Dry between towels. 

To Shred Almonds. Cut blanched almonds in thin strips 
lengthwise of the nut. 

Macaroon Dust. Dry macaroons pounded and sifted. 

To Shell Chestnuts. Cut a half-inch gash on fiat sides 
and put in an omelet pan, allowing one-half teaspoon butter 
to each cup chestnuts. Shake over range until butter is 
melted. Put in oven and let stand five minutes. Remove 
from oven, and with a small knife take off shells. By this 
method shelling and blanching is accomplished at the same 
time, as skins adhere to shells. 

Flavoring Extracts and "Wine should be added if possible 
to a mixture when cold. If added while mixture is hot, 
much of the goodness passes off with the steam. 

Meat Glaze. Four quarts stock reduced to one cup. 

Biised Mustard. Mix two tablespoons mustard and one 
teasppon sugar, add hot water gradually until of the con- 
sistency of a thick paste. Vinegar may be used in place of 
water. 

To Prevent SiQt from Lumping. Mix with corn-starch, 
allowing one teaspoon corn-starch to six teaspoons salt. 

To VTash Csurafes. Half fill with hot soapsuds, to which 
is added one teaspoon washing soda. Put in newspaper torn 
in small pieces. Let stand one-half hour, occasionally shak- 
ing. Empty, rinse with hot water, drain, wipe outside, and 
let stand to dry inside. 



588 BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

After Broiling or Prying, if any fat lias spattered ou range, 
wipe surface at once with newspaper. 

To Remove Fruit Stains. Pour boiling water over stained 
surface, having it fall from a distance of three feet This 
is a much better way than dipping stain in and out of hot 
water ; or wring articles out of cold water and hang out of 
doors on a frosty night. 

To Remove Stains of Claret VTlne. As soon as claret 
is spilt, cover spot with salt. Let stand a few minutes, 
then rinse in cold water. 

To Clean Graniteware where mixtures have been cooked 
or burned on. Half fill with cold water, add washing soda, 
heat water gradually to boiling-point, then empty, when dish 
may be easily washed. Pearline or any soap-powder may be 
used in place of washing soda. 

To 'Wash Mirrors and 'Windows. Rub over with chamois 
skin wrung out of warm water, then wipe with a piece of dry 
chamois skin. This method saves much strength. 

To Remove 'White Spots from Furniture. Dip a cloth 
in hot water nearly to boiling-point. Place over spot, remove 
quickly, and rub over spot with a dry cloth. Repeat if spot 
is not removed. Alcohol or camphor quickly applied may 
be used. 

Tumblers which have contained milk should be first rinsed 
in cold water before washing in hot water. 

To keep a Sink Drain free from grease, pour down ODce 
a week at night one-half can Babbitt's potash dissolved in 
one quart water. 

Should Sink Drain chance to get choked, pour into sink 
one-fourth pound copperas dissolved in two quarts boiling 
water. If this is not efficacious, repeat before sending for a 
plumber. 

Never put Knives with ivory handles in water. Hot water 
causes them to crack and discolor. 



HELPFUL HINTS FOR THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 589 

To prevent Glassware from being easily broken, put in a 
kettle of cold water, heat gradually until water has reached 
boiling-point. Set aside ; when water is cold take out glass. 
This is a most desirable way to toughen lamp chimneys. 

To Remove Grease Spots. Cold water and Ivory Soap 
will remove grease spots from cotton and woollen fabrics. 
Castilian Cream is useful for black woollen goods, but leaves 
a light ring on delicately colored goods. Ether is always sure 
and safe to use. 

To Remove Iron Rust. Saturate spot with lemon juice, 
then cover with salt. Let stand in the sun for several hours; 
or a solution of hydrochloric acid may be used. 

Iron Rust may be removed from delicate fabrics by cov- 
ering spot thickly with cream of tartar, then twisting cloth 
to keep cream of tartar over spot ; put in a saucepan of cold 
water, and heat water gradually to boiling-point. 

To Remove Grass Stains from cotton goods, wash in 
alcohol. 

To Remove Ink Stains. Wash in a solution of hydro- 
chloric acid, and rinse in ammonia water. Wet the spot 
with warm water, put on Sapolio, rub gently between the 
hands, and generally the spot will disappear. 

Cut Glass should be washed and rinsed in water that is 
not very hot and of same temperature. 

In Sweeping Carpets, keep broom close to floor and work 
with the grain of the carpet. Occasionally turn broom that 
it may wear evenly. 

Tie Strands of a New Broom closely together, put into 
a pail of boiling water, and soak two hours. Dry thoroughly 
before using. 

Never wash the inside of Tea or Coffee Pots with soap- 
suds. If granite or agate ware is used, and becomes badly 
discolored, nearly fill pot with cold water, add one table- 
spoon borax, and heat gradually until water reaches the boil- 



690 BOSTON COOKIKG-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

ing-point. Rinse with hot water, wipe, and keep on back of 
range until perfectly dry. 

Never put cogs of a Dover Egg-beater in water. 

Never wash Bread Boards in a sink. Scrub with grain of 
wood, using a small brush. 

Before using a new Iron Kettle, grease inside and outside, 
and let stand forty -eight hours ; then wash in hot water in 
which a large lump of cooking soda has been dissolved. 

To clean a Copper Boiler, use Putz Pomade Cream. Ap- 
ply with a woollen cloth when boiler is warm, not hot ; then 
rub off with second woollen cloth and polish with flannel or 
chamois. If badly tarnished, use oxalic acid. Faucets and 
brasses are treated in the same way. 

A bottle containing Oxalic Acid should be marked poison, 
and kept on a high shelf. 

To keep an Ice Chest in good condition, wash thoroughly 
once a week with cold or lukewarm water in which washing 
soda has been dissolved. If by chance anything is spilt in 
an ice chest, it should be wiped off at once. 

Milk and butter very quickly absorb odors, and if in ice 
chest with other foods, should be kept closely covered. 

Hard "Wood Floors and Furniture may be polished by 
using a small quantity of kerosene oil applied with a woollen 
cloth, then rubbing with a clean woollen cloth. A very good 
furniture polish is made by using equal parts linseed oil and 
turpentine. 

Polish for Hard VTood Floors. Use one part beeswax 
to two parts turpentine. Put in saucepan on range, and 
when wax is dissolved a i)a8te will be formed. 

To clean Piano Eleys, rub over with alcohol. 

To remove old Tea and Coffee Stains, wet spot with cold 
water, cover with glycerine, and let stand two or three hours. 
Then wash with cold water and hard soap. Repeat if 

necessary. 



HELPFUL HINTS FOR THE YOUNG HOUSEKEEPER 591 

Before Sweeping Old Carpets, sprinkle with pieces of 
newspaper wrung out of water. After sweeping, wipe over 
with a cloth wrung out of a weak solution of ammonia water, 
which seems to brighten colors. 

Piatt's Chloride is one of the best Disinfectants. Chloride 
of lime is a valuable disinfectant, and much cheaper than 
Piatt's Chloride. 

Iiisterine is an excellent disinfectant to use for the mouth 
and throat 

To Make a Pastry Bag. Fold a twelve-inch square of 
rubber cloth from two opposite corners. Sew edges together, 
forming a triangular bag. Cut off point to make opening 
large enough to* insert a tin pastry tube. A set comprising 
bag and twelve adjustable tubes may be bought for two and 
one-half dollars. 

Smoked Ceilings may be cleaned by washing with cloths 
wrung out of water in which a small piece of washing soda 
has been dissolved. 

Per a Burn apply equal parts of white of egg and olive 
oil mixed together, then cover with a piece of old linen ; if 
applied at once no blister will form. Or apply at once cook- 
ing soda, then cover with cloth and keep the same wet with 
cold water. This takes out the pain and prevents blistering. 

Curtain and Portiere Poles allow the hangings to slip 
easily if rubbed with hard soap. This is much better than 
greasing. 

Creaking Doors and Drawers should be treated in the 
same way. 

To Remove Dust from Rattan Furniture use a painter's 
small brush.

are frequently served before guests enter the diniog-room. 

Second Course 

Clear soup, with bread sticks, small rolls, or crisp crackers. 
Where two soups are served, one may be a cream soup. 
Cream soups are served with croutons. Radishes, celery, or

A FULL COUESB DINNER *601 

Third Course 
Bouchees or rissoles. The filling to be of light meat. 

Fourth Course 
Fish, baked, boiled, or fried. Cole slaw, dressed cucum- 
bers, or tomatoes accompany this course; with fried fish 
potatoes are often served. 

Fifth Course 
Roast saddle of venison or mutton, spring lamb, or fillet 
of beef ; potatoes and one other vegetable. 

Sixth Course 
Entree, made of light meat or fish. 

Seventh Course 

A vegetable. Mushrooms^ cauliflower, asparagus, or arti- 
chokes are served. 

Eighth Course 

Punch or cheese course. Punch, when served, always 
precedes the game course. 

Ninth Course 
Game, with vegetable salad, usually lettuce or celery ; or 
cheese sticks may be served with the salad, and game omitted. 

Tenth Course 
Dessert, usually cold. 

Eleventh Course 

Frozen dessert and fancy cakes. Bonbons are passed 
after this course. 

Twelfth Course 

Cracker, cheese, and caf^ noir. Caf^ noir is frequently 
served in the drawing and smoking rooms after the dinner. 

Where wines and liquors are served, the first course is not 
usually accompanied by either ; but if desired, Sauterne or 
other white wine may be used. 

With soup, serve Sherry ; with fish, white wine ; with 
game, Claret ; with roast and other courses, Champagne. 



60Sr BOSTON COOKING-SCHOOL COOK BOOK 

After serving cafd ooir in drawing-room, pass pony of 
brandy for men, sweet liqueur (Chartreuse, Benedictine, or 
Parfait d'Amour) for women ; then Cr§me de Menthe for ail. 

After a short time Apollinaris should be passed. White 
wines should be served cool ; Sherry should be as near the 
temperature of the room in which it is served as possible. 
Champagne should be served very cold by allowing it to 
remain in salt and ice at least one-half hour before dinner 
time. Claret, served without cooling, and as it contains so 
small amount of alchohol, is not good the day after opening. 

For a simpler dinner, the third, seventh, eighth, and tenth 
courses, and the game in the ninth course, may be omitted. 

For a home dinner, it is always desirable to serve for first 
course a soup; second course, meat or fish, with potatoes 
and two other vegetables ; third course, a vegetable salad, 
with French dressing ; fourth course, dessert ; fifth coarse, 
crackers, cheese, and caf^ noir. 

At a ladies' luncheon the courses are as many as at a 
small dinner. In winter, grape fruit is sometimes served 
in place of oysters; in summer, selected strawberries in 
small Swedish Timbale cases.

principles necessary for a day's ration, for those of different 
age, sex, and occupation, is emphasized, thus enabling the 
pupil to arrange well-balanced dietaries. Attention is paid 
to the selection of supplies with reference to economy and 
utility, thus tending to develop an interest in marketing and
