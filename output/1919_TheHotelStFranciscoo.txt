PREFACE 

In this, my book, I have endeavored to give expression to the art of cook- 
ery as developed in recent years in keeping with the importance of the catering 
business, in particular the hotel business, which, in America, now leads the 
world. 

I have been fortunate in studying under the great masters of the art in 
Europe and America; and since my graduation as Chef I have made several 
journeys of observation to New York, and to England, France and Switzer- 
land to learn the new in cooking and catering. 

I have named my book The Hotel St. Francis Cook Book in compliment 
to the house which has given me in so generous measure the opportunity to 
produce and reproduce, always with the object of reflecting a cuisine that is 
the best possible. 

The recipes in my book calling for wines and liqueurs for flavoring may 
be followed by those whose legitimate supplies are not used up; and where 
these cannot be had there are non-alcoholic substitutes available with the 
flavor near perfect. The juic; of lemons will serve in many cases to give 
agreeable flavor. 

The spaces left open in the pages of the book are for the purpose of afford- 
ing convenient place for writing in additional recipes. The paper on which 
the book is printed is specially selected for this purpose.

the oysters in the center. Serve with light cream around the omelet. 

Perch saute, meuniere. Season the fish well with salt and pepper, roll in 
flour, put in frying pan and cook with butter. When done, put fish on platter, 
and put a fresh piece of butter in pan, over fire, and allow to become hazelnut 
color. Pour the butter and the juice of a lemon over the fish, sprinkle with 
chopped parsley, and garnish with quartered lemons and parsley in branches. 

Browned hashed potatoes. Hash three cold boiled potatoes. Melt three 
ounces of butter in a frying pan, add the potatoes, season with salt and pepper,

wide vessel. Dip a tablespoon in hot water and form the beaten eggs, or 
meringue, into the shape and size of an tgg, and drop into the boiling milk. 
Dip the spoon in hot water each time so the meringue will not stick. Take off 
the fire and let stand for a few minutes, turning the floating eggs several times. 
Then take out of the milk and dress on napkin to cool. Boil the milk again and 
bind with the yolks of two eggs, strain and cool. Put the sauce in a bowl, or 
deep dish, and float the "islands" on top. Serve very cold.

signifying cut in slender strips, or match shape. For consomme garnish cut 
"Julienne" style one carrot, one turnip, one leek, a small piece of celery, four 
leaves of cabbage, and one-half of an onion. Season with a spoonful of salt, 
and one-half teaspoonful of sugar. Mix well. Put in a well-buttered casserole, 
cover with buttered paper and the casserole cover, put in oven moderately 
hot, and allow to simmer slowly. Turn occasionally, using a fork to avoid 
breaking the vegetables. They should simmer without adding liquid, but 
should they be too dry, a half cup of consomme may be added. Cook until soft, 
and drain on a sieve so all the juice will run off. Combine with two quarts 
of consomme, and before serving add a few peas and some chervil. 

Fillet of sole, Gasser. Put four fillets of sole in cold milk seasoned with 
salt and pepper, and leave for four hours. Then wrap around raw potatoes, 
cut like a cork, and about three inches long. Let one side extend over the 
potato, and fasten with a toothpick. Fry slowly in swimming lard until golden 
brown, then take out, remove the toothpick, push out the potato, and fill the 
center of the sole with a very thick filling composed of two-thirds Bearnaise 
sauce and one-third of reduced tomato sauce. Serve on napkin with fried 
parsley, and tomato sauce, separate.

from a five-cent loaf of bread, twelve whole boiled chestnuts, three boiled 
fresh, or canned, apricots, six stewed prunes, three boiled, or canned, pears, 
and two peaches. Put in a bowl, add an egg and one gill of brandy, and mix 
well. Fill the capon, wrap a piece of fat pork around it, and put in roasting 
pan with a carrot, onion, bouquet garni, and three ounces of butter. Put in 
oven and roast slowly, basting continually until done. Remove the capon to 
a platter and take off the fat pork. Return the pan to fire and bring to a boil. 
When the fat is clear drain it off and add to the pan one-half cup of bouillon 
and one cup of brown gravy. Season, boil, strain and pour over the capon.

few minutes. Then add a cup of fresh-boiled chestnuts, mix well, and serve

Boiled spinach. Clean the spinach and wash in four or five waters, as it 
is difficult to remove the sand. It is sometimes necessary to wash as many as 
ten times to remove it all. Put a gallon of water and a handful of salt in a 
pot and bring to the boiling point. Add the spinach, and boil over a very hot 
fire, so it will remain green. It will require from five to ten minutes, depending 
upon the tenderness of the spinach. Drain off water and serve plain. Or, 
cool with cold water, press dry with the hand, and prepare as desired. 

Spinach, English style. Add a small piece of butter to plain spinach.

four raw beaten eggs, put in buttered mould, set in pan in boiling water, and 
put in moderate oven for ten minutes. Allow to cool, cut in slices, and serve

tos, drain off the juice, cut the pepper in four, place on a platter, season with 
salt and pepper, add one part vinegar and two parts olive oil, and sprinkle 
with chopped parsley.

and serve the meat and potatoes very hot, with chopped parsley on top. 

Rolled oats pudding. Boil one pint of milk with half of a split vanilla 
bean; add two ounces of rolled oats and two ounces of sugar, and cook for

Fillet of sole, Rose Caron. Skin the four fillets of one large sole and 
place on a buttered pan. Put on top of each, three slices of cooked lobster, 
season with salt and paprika, add one-half glass of white wine, cover with 
buttered paper, put in oven and cook for twelve minutes. Remove the fillets 
to a platter, taking care that the lobster does not fall off. To the gravy in 
the pan add one pint of white wine sauce and boil for ten minutes, then add 
two tablespoonsful of ecrevisse butter, and strain the sauce over the fish. 
Heat in sherry wine sixteen slices of truffles, and put four on top of each 
fillet, after the sauce has been added. Garnish with ileurons. 

Sweet potatoes. Southern style. Peel and slice some boiled sweet pota- 
toes and put in buttered shirred egg dishes, or pie plates. Add a little salt, 
molasses and maple syrup, sprinkle with powdered sugar, put some small 
bits of butter on top, and bake in oven until brown. 

Vol au vent, or patty shells. Take some puff paste, with six turns, and 
roll out to about one-quarter inch in thickness. With a round pastry cutter 
about three inches in diameter, cut the paste. Then moisten with egg, and 
with the tip of a small knife trace a ring on each patty about one-half inch 
from the edge. Bakfe in a hot oven for about twenty minutes. Take out of 
the oven and with the knife point lift off the center cover within the traced 
circle, and empty of the uncooked paste inside. 

Garniture Toulouse. Cut the garnishing to agree with the size of the 
patty. For the size described above cut in pieces about one-half inch square. 
For larger patties cut from an inch to an inch and a half square. Use the 
boiled breast of chicken, sweetbreads boiled in chicken broth, and French 
mushrooms in equal parts, one-half of a sliced truffle to each person, three 
chicken dumplings, teaspoon size cut in two, rooster kidneys and rooster 
combs. Mix well, and stew in a sauce Allemande made of chicken broth and

Cup custard. Mix four eggs, one-quarter pound of sugar, one pint of 
milk, and flavor with vanilla. Strain, pour into cups, and bake in bain-marie 
until firm. It will require about one-half hour in a moderate oven. 

Bain-marie. This is a term used in cookery for a vessel holding hot 
water in which another vessel may be heated at a temperature not above that 
of boiling water. Different dishes are variously allowed to stand, cook or 
bake in bain-marie. For example, Hollandaise sauce should be kept in bain- 
marie in hot water. Hollandaise or Bearnaise sauce, if kept in boiling water, 
would turn. A cream soup should be kept in boiling water, as extra cooking 
will not harm it. Timbale of chicken, custard for soup, or cup custard, should 
be cooked in bain-marie. 

Puree Crecy (soup). Slice six carrots very thin, put in casserole with 
three ounces of butter, and simmer for thirty minutes. Then add three pints 
of well-seasoned chicken broth, and boil for one hour. Strain through a fine 
sieve. Serve in a separate dish small squares of bread fried in butter. 

Roast leg of mutton. The leg of mutton should hang in the ice box at 
least four days before using. If too fresh it will be tough. Rub the mutton 
with salt and pepper and, if desired, a little garlic. Put in a roasting pan, 
one sliced onion, one sliced carrot, one bay leaf and two cloves. Now put 
in the mutton, with a piece of butter on top, and place in oven to roast. 
Baste continually. It will require from forty-five to sixty minutes to cook. 
If desired well done cook for another thirty minutes. When done take out 
the leg, drain off the fat, and make a gravy by adding one cup of stock and 
one spoonful of meat extract; boil, season, and strain.

Thon marine salad. Tunny fish can be obtained in cans, the best quality 
being the French brands. Break up the fish with the fingers, and place on a 
platter with leaves of lettuce. The fish should be in pieces about one inch 
and a half thick. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, chopped parsley, chervil, and 
a little finely sliced chives, and a sauce of one-third vinegar and two-thirds 
olive oil. 

Stuffed breast of veal, au jus. Have your butcher prepare a breast of 
veal ready for stuffing. Use the same dressing as for chicken, and sew up 
the end so the dressing will not fall out while roasting. Put in the roasting 
pan one sliced onion and one carrot. Put in the veal and sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. Put bits of butter all over the top and roast in oven, basting 
often. It will take about an hour to cook in a moderate oven. Remove the 
veal to platter when done, and make a sauce by adding to the gravy in pan 
one cup of bouillon and one spoonful of meat extract, boil for five minutes, 
and strain. 

Asparagus tips, au gratin. Put the tips in a buttered pan or silver dish, 
cover with well-seasoned cream sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese and small 
bits of butter and bake in oven until brown. 

Corned beef and cabbage. The best corned beef is that made from the 
brisket. Put on fire in cold water and skim when it comes to the boiling 
point. Cover and let it boil slowly until about three-quarters done. *Then 
add two heads of well-washed cabbage cut in four, and cook with the beef for 
at least one hour. ">

Russian salad. Equal parts of boiled carrots, turnips, beets and pota- 
toes, cut in small dice, boiled peas, boiled string beans cut in small pieces, 
and one slice of cold roast beef cut in small squares. Put all in salad bowl, 
season with salt, pepper, a little Cayenne pepper, and just enough tarragon 
vinegar to wet the mixture. Let stand for one hour, drain off the liquid, if 
any, and form the salad in pyramid shape in the bowl. Spread some thick 
mayonnaise over all, and garnish with boiled potatoes and truffles, cut like 
a five-cent piece, linking one to the other around the base of the salad like a 
chain. On top put a small flower of a boiled and seasoned cauliflower, and 
serve very cold. 

Caramel custard. Put two ounces of sugar in a copper pan and cook 
until it is brown in color, then pour into a custard mould and allow to become 
cold. Mix four eggs with one-quarter of a pound of sugar, flavor with vanilla, 
add one pint of milk, and strain. Pour over the burned sugar, and fill the 
mould. Put in bain-marie and cook until firm. When cool, reverse the cus- 
tard on a dish, and serve. The caramel at the bottom of the mould will 
serve as a sauce. 

Tomate Parisienne (Hors d'oeuvres). Peel and slice four tomatoes and 
lay on platter with lettuce leaves. Cut the inside of a stalk of celery in very 
small dice, and six anchovies in small squares. Put in a bowl, add a pinch 
of salt, some fresh-ground black pepper, some chives, parsley and chervil 
chopped fine, and one spoonful of vinegar and two of olive oiL Mix well and 
pour over the tomatoes. 

Sorrel. Sorrel is a fine vegetable for the promotion of health. Remove 
the stems from a peck of sorrel and wash the leaves in four different waters, 
to remove all the sand. Have a kettle with salted water on the fire. Put the 
sorrel into the boiling water and cook for ten minutes, stirring often. Pour 
off the water and let stand in the colander fifteen minutes so it will drain 
dry, then strain through a fine sieve. Then put the sorrel in a sauce pan 
with three ounces of butter and bring to the boiling point. Season with salt 
and pepper, and bind with two whole eggs, beaten. Do not let it boil after 
adding the eggs, but let it get just hot enough to give the sorrel a firm body. 
Garnish with the half of a hard boiled egg, if desired.

Eggs a la Russe. Spread a piece of toast with fresh caviar, put an egg 
fried in oil on top, and put anchovy sauce around the edge on the platter. 

Eggs fried in oil. Fry the eggs one at a time. Have a very small frying 
pan with plenty of very hot olive oil in it. Drop a fresh egg in it, and turn 
with a wooden spoon. If any other kind of spoon is used the egg will stick 
to it. When of a good yellow color, take out and place on a towel, so the oil 
can drain off, and season with salt. The eggs should be soft inside, like a 
poached egg. 

Anchovy sauce. To a cup of cream add one spoonful of essence of 
anchovies, or one teaspoonful of anchovy paste. Anchovy sauce is also 
made with sauce Allemande, white wine sauce, or even a brown sauce, if 
desired. The cream sauce with the essence is more commonly used with eggs. 

Boiled beef tongue. Put a fresh beef tongue in cold water and bring 
to the boiling point, skim, add salt, one carrot, one onion, a bouquet garni, 
one stalk of celery, and one of leek. Boil until tongue is soft. The bouillon 
may be used for stock or soup, or to make caper sauce. For beef tongue 
with spinach, put plain boiled spinach on platter, sliced tongue on top, and 
pour a little of the broth over all. 

Raspberry Bavarois. (For four or five persons.) One pint of milk, one 
pint of whipped cream, the yolks of four eggs, one-quarter pound of sugar, 
six sheets of French gelatine, and one-half pint of raspberry juice. Boil the 
milk with the sugar, then pour over the yolks, and set on the fire again until 
it thickens, but do not let it boil. Wash the gelatine in cold water, add to 
the mixture, and stir until melted. Then set aside until cold. Mix the rasp- 
berry pulp with the whipped cream, and stir into the mixture. Put in mould 
and place in ice box until set. Turn out on platter, and serve with whipped 
cream or raspberry syrup, separate or around the bavarois. 

Sardines on toast. Take sardines from can and put on a fine thin wire 
broiler and heat quickly. Serve on toast with maitre d'hotel butter on top, 
and garnish with quartered lemons and parsley.

season with salt and pepper; add one-half glass of white wine and one-half 
glass of stock, bouillon, fish broth or water, cover with buttered paper, and 
put in oven to bake. When done place the aiguillettes on a platter and cover

dozen clams and cut in two ; cut half of the tail of a lobster in small squares, 
and six heads of mushrooms cut in two. Put all of this in the strained sauce, 
and season well. 

Giblet sauce. Clean the giblets of chickens, turkeys, or other fowl, boil 
in salt water, and chop. Put in casserole two chopped onions, and two ounces 
of butter, and simmer for ten minutes, or until soft and yellow. Then add 
one tablespoonful of flour, and simmer again until brown. Add the gravy

boiled in. Cook for half an hour, season with salt and pepper and chopped 
parsley. A little sherry wine may be added before serving, if desired.

Fried whitebait. Wash the whitebait well and dry on a towel or napkin. 
Roll in milk, then in flour, and fry in very hot swimming lard, just enough to 
make them crisp. Lay them on a napkin, sprinkle with salt, and garnish 
with fried parsley and quartered lemons. Serve brown bread and butter 
sandwiches and sauce Tartar or remoulade. 

Pot au feu. Put in a pot one brisket of beef ; or five pounds of short ribs 
of beef; two gallons of cold water, and a handful of salt. Bring slowly to 
a boil and skim well, so the broth will remain clear. When the boiling point 
is reached add two whole carrots, two turnips, three stalks of leeks, one stalk 
of celery, a bouquet garni, one small head of Savoy cabbage, and two large 
onions, all well washed. Bring to the boiling point again, cover, and put on 
the side of the stove where it will simmer slowly. The vegetables will be 
done before the meat, so when they are cooked remove them and throw out 
the bouguet garni. Let the beef cook until very soft. Cut the vegetables, with 
the exception of the onions, in thin slices; and when the beef is done strain 
the broth over the vegetables. Give it another boil, season well, add some 
chopped chervil, and serve with toasted bread crusts, separate. 

The boiled beef may be served as an extra course, usually after the soup, 
if no fish is served. 

Loin of pork, baker's oven style. For a large family, take eight pounds 
of pork ribs, season with salt and pepper, rub with a piece of garlic thoroughly, 
and put into a stoneware pot. Cut six large potatoes in strips lengthwise 
and one inch square, slice three onions and add, with three pints of water, 
a bay leaf and two cloves, to the meat. Your baker will bake it for you in 
a brick oven, and it will be a dish quite different from the usual roasted pork. 
If necessary, put it in your own oven, baking for not less than four hours 
with a slow, even fire. However, it is preferable to have it baked in a 
brick oven. 

Fried chicken, Vienna style. Cut a chicken in six pieces ; two legs, two 
wings, and two pieces of breast. Season with salt and pepper, roll in flour, 
then in beaten eggs, and finally in fresh bread crumbs. Put in a saute pan 
in two spoonfuls of hot butter, and fry. When done dish up on a platter, 
garnish with corn fritters, and serve sauce supreme separate. 

Peas, farmer style. Shell enough peas to make two cupsful. Take twelve 
firm large asparagus tips, an onion, a firm head of lettuce cut fine, six small 
French carrots cut in two, three ounces of butter, a pinch of salt and one of 
sugar. Add enough water to cover, and simmer slowly until all the vegetables 
are thoroughly done.

Broiled kippered herring. Kippered herring may be obtained in cans. 
Dip in oil and broil very lightly, cover with maitre d'hotel sauce, and garnish 
with lemon and parsley. 

Eggs, Careme. Butter a shirred &gg dish, crack two eggs into it, and 
season with salt and pepper. Slice a truffle and a few canned mushrooms, 
mix with a little cream sauce, and pour over the eggs. Bake in oven. 

Hot buckwurst. Secure the buckwurst from your butcher, lay them in 
boiling water for ten minutes, but do not let the water boil after they have 
been put in it. 

Potage Eliza. Same as potage sante. 

How to boil terrapin. Put two live terrapin into boiling water and leave 
for two minutes. Then remove the outer skin from the feet, neck and head, 
with a towel. Put the terrapin in a kettle with two quarts of cold water, an 
onion, a carrot, a bay leaf, and one clove, and boil until the feet are soft. The 
time required depends upon the age of the terrapin, some being cooked in 
fifteen minutes, and others requiring two or three hours. When done open 
the shell, take out all the meat, and the liver, removing the gall from the 
latter with scissors. Remove the tail and claws and head. Cut up the legs 
in inch-long pieces, or at the joints, as preferred. Reduce the broth by boiling 
down to about a cupful, and put in a jar with the meat, and add a whiskey 
glass of sherry wine. The terrapin is then ready to prepare in any style 
desired. 

Terrapin, Maryland. Put one cup of terrapin, prepared as above, in a 
flat pan, add a little grated nutmeg, salt and pepper, and half a glass of dry 
sherry. Boil until half reduced, then add a cup of thick cream, boil, and 
thicken with the yolks of two eggs, a quarter of a cup of thick cream and an 
ounce of butter beaten together. Heat, but do not boil. Serve in chafing dish, 
with dry sherry, and toast on the side. 

Terrapin, Jockey club. Same as Terrapin, Maryland. Before serving 
add two ponies of Cognac and six slices of truffles. 

Terrapin, Baltimore. One cup of the prepared terrapin without the liver. 
Put in saucepan with salt, pepper, nutmeg, celery salt, and a glass of dry 
sherry. Boil for five minutes. Mash the liver in a salad bowl, add the yolks 
of two raw eggs, one ounce of sweet butter, and strain through a fine sieve. 
Add a cup of brown sauce to the simmering terrapin, then add the liver pre- 
pared as above, pouring in gradually. Heat barely enough to thicken. Before 
serving add half a glass of dry sherry.

Crab in chafing dish. Mince a shallot onion and brown slightly with 
two spoonfuls of butter. Add a spoonful of flour, mixing well, then add a 
half pint of sweet milk, and stir to a smooth cream. Add the meat of a Cali- 
fornia crab (or six eastern crabs) and a tablespoonful of sherry. Place toast, 
cut in fancy shapes, on a deep platter, and cover with the crab. This is a favorite 
way of preparing crab. 

Crab meat au gratin. Shred the meat of one crab, mix with a cup of 
cream sauce and a little paprika, or Cayenne ; or if this is too strong use white 
pepper. Fill individual baking dishes, and sprinkle the top liberally with 
grated Parmesan cheese. Bake in an oven until the top is an even brown. 

Crab meat. Gourmet. Put a quarter of a pound of picked shrimps in a 
saucepan, add one ounce of butter and one-half whiskey-glassful of dry sherry 
wine. Simmer for five minutes, then add the meat of one crab, prepared 
Monza. 

Crab meat, Suzette. Bake four good-sized potatoes, and cut off one side 
like the cover of a box. Scoop the insides out with a spoon, and fill with the 
meat of one crab prepared in cream. Sprinkle some grated Parmesan or Swiss 
cheese on top, and bake in oven until nice and brown. Serve on napkins, gar- v 
nished with parsley in branches and quartered lemons. 

Oysters or crab, a la Poulette. If for oysters, boil them in their own 
liquid for about five minutes. If the small California oysters are used boil for 
half that time. Into this liquid of, say, a pint of oysters, stir a heaping tea- 
spoonful of corn starch mixed with a half pint of white wine. Then beat the 
yolks of two eggs with half a cup of cream, and stir slowly into the above, 
add two large spoonfuls of butter, and keep on the stove but do not let it boil. 
Finally squeeze in the juice of half a small lemon. If crab is used, cut the 
meat in small pieces, and make the sauce in the same manner, but instead of 
beginning with the Juice of oysters for the foundation of the sauce, begin 
with a cup and a half of cream and water in equal proportions, thicken with 
corn starch, then add the yolks of eggs, etc., as above. The oysters or the 
crab meat should be added last. 

Crab meat, a la Louise. Have the crab meat thoroughly chilled, and 
allow one crab to three or four people, according to the size of the fish. Use 
small fancy fish plates, or salad plates. Lay on each plate some slices of the 
white hearts of firm heads of lettuce. Lay on top some canned Spanish 
pimentos, using the brilliant red variety, which is sweet. On top of this place 
the crab meat, taking care not to break it too small. Over all pour French 
dressing made with tarragon vinegar, well-seasoned with freshly-ground black 
pepper.

Pnme souffle. Wash a cupful of prunes thoroughly, and soak them over 
night. Boil them in the water in which they were soaked, flavoring with half 
of a vanilla bean, and sweetened with a cupful of sugar. When done pour off 
and save the juice. Strain the pulp through a colander or wire sieve, making 
a good firm puree, and about a cupful in quantity. Whip the whites of six 
eggs until dry, then whip in the prune pulp, and bake in the same manner as 
an omelette souffle. Bake on a platter, formed into a symmetrical mound; 
or in a buttered pudding mould. Serve hot or cold, with a sauce made of the 
flavored juice in which the prunes were cooked, or it may be served with

flavor is liked. Cook for about ten minutes. Chop the clams, and add last 
of all, as they do not require much cooking. Just before serving add a few 
hard crackers broken into bits. 

Crab cocktail, Victor. Place a boiled crab on ice and chill thoroughly, 
then remove the meat, taking care not to break the pieces more than neces- 
sary. Make a sauce with three-quarters of a cup of tomato ketchup, a tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce, two tablespoonfuls of tarragon vinegar, 
and a good pinch of freshly-ground pepper. Mix with the crab meat, fill the

two hares, and lard them with thin strips of larding pork. Put them in an 
agate pan, add a little salt, and one-half cup of whole black peppers wrapped 
in cheese cloth. Cover with from two to three quarts of sour cream, and stand 
in a cool place for forty-eight hours. Then put the saddles in a roasting pan 
with a sliced onion and carrot, and a little butter on top, and roast in a hot oven 
for about ten minutes, or until brown. Then strain the sour cream, and add 
little by little to the saddles, while roasting. Baste continually, and after 
forty minutes you should have a nice brown sauce. Remove the saddles to a 
platter, reduce the sauce one-half, season with salt if necessary, and a little 
paprika, strain part over the saddles, and serve the remainder in a bowl.

butter, and allow it to brown. Serve in the shape of an omelet. 

Corned beef hash au gratin. Make a corned beef hash and put in a but- 
tered, deep, silver vegetable dish, sprinkle with bread crumbs, put a small piece 
of butter on top, and bake in oven until brown. 

Lamb cutlets in papers. Fry the cutlets in a saute pan, in melted fat pork, 
turning frequently. Brown only slightly, allowing them to remain rare. Then 
remove the cutlets, and in the fat simmer some minced onions, mushrooms and 
parsley for a few minutes. When nearly done add some shredded lean ham. 
Now prepare some oiled paper, tearing it heart-shaped, lay the cutlet on one 
half, surrounding it with the minced herbs, with a little on top also ; then fold 
over the paper, creasing the edges together like a hem. Lay on a buttered 
dish, and set in oven until nicely colored. 

Puree of onions (Soubise). Peel and slice one dozen large white onions, 
put in a casserole with one-quarter pound of butter, cover, and put in oven for 
about forty-five minutes, or until soft ; but do not allow them to become brown. 
Then drain off the butter and add one pint of thick cream sauce, season well 
with salt and white pepper, and strain through a fine sieve.

Venetian egg in chafing dish. Mince an onion and cook in saute pan in

minutes. Add a pound of eastern cheese, broken into small bits ; season with 
salt, paprika, a little Worcestershire sauce, and half a teaspoonful of mustard. 
Stir continuously. Last, add three lightly beaten eggs, and stir until thick. It

Eggs, Voltaire. In the bottom of a buttered cocotte or tgg dish place a 
spoonful of chicken hash, on top break a raw tgg, and season. Cover with 
cream sauce and grated cheese. Bake until the tops are brown. 

Cream of chicken, Reine Hortense. Make a cream of chicken soup in the 
usual way. Take a cup of peeled almonds to each quart of the soup, pound 
into a pulp in a mortar, pulverizing thoroughly ; mix with milk, strain, and add 
to the soup. 

Canape Romanoff. Mix a boxful of smoked Norwegian sardines with 
three ounces of hot butter, mash fine, and force through a sieve. Stir in four 
spoonfuls of cream, and spread over toast cut in fancy shapes. Garnish with 
ripe and green olives. Serve as a fancy sandwich at tea or bridge parties, or as 
an appetiser for dinner. 

Braised sweetbreads, Marie Louise. Soak the sweetbreads in cold water 
for no less than three hours, changing the water two or three times. This

water to cool. In a saucepan put a sliced carrot, a sliced onion, a bay leaf, a 
clove, parsley in branches, a piece of salt pork rind, butter the size of half an 
egg, and one cup of stock or broth of any kind. Place the sweetbreads on top, 
and place in oven and cook for half an hour, basting frequently. The sweet- 
breads should turn an even yellow. Trim some artichoke bottoms, cut in half, 
and place the sweetbreads on top. Mix the juice from the baked sweetbreads 
with a cup of cream sauce and a sherry glassful of dry sherry. Pour this 
over the top, sprinkle with chopped parsley, and return to oven for two minutes. 

Pears in syrup. Make a syrup with a cup of sugar, and water enough to 
cover. Add the juice or rind of a lemon, a few cloves, and a stick of cinnamon. 
Quarter the pears, remove the cores, and cook in the syrup for eight or ten 
minutes, or until tender. Old hard pears may require a half an hour or more 
before they are sufficiently cooked. A little claret or white wine may be 
added, if desired.

Cocoa cake. Half a cup of butter, a cup of sugar, three eggs, a teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla, three-fourths of a cup of milk, six level tablespoonfuls of cocoa, 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and one and three-fourth cups of sifted 
flour. Cream the butter, adding the sugar gradually, then add the eggs one 
by one, whipping vigorously. Sift together half of the flour, the cocoa and 
the baking powder, then add the milk and the rest of the flour, making a 
mixture that will drop from the spoon. When all is mixed together put in 
a pan or mould, and bake for thirty-five minutes. Cover the cake with a plain 
icing. A cake is baked when it shrinks from the pan, or if, when you press it 
it springs back. 

Dubney sandwiches. To a cupful of chopped chicken or turkey meat 
add a spoonful of mayonnaise, a teaspoonful of minced onion, two minced 
shallots, a pinch of chopped chives, and season with salt and pepper. Spread

crushed salted almonds, and a liqueur glassful of kirsch. Spread on thin 
slices of brown bread. 

Olive sandwiches. Chop equal parts of olives and onions together, add 
a few drops of olive oil and a little pepper, but no salt, as the olives have 
enough. Spread on thin slices of buttered bread. 

Windsor sandwiches. Chop enough chicken or turkey to make a cup of 
meat, add half as much chopped ham, and half a dozen chopped olives. Bind 
together with mayonnaise. Spread on white and on brown buttered bread. 

Creole sandwiches. Chop some fresh or canned sweet peppers, bind 
together with mayonnaise, and add a bit of minced parsley. Spread on both 
white and brown bread. Always make the sandwiches dainty and thin. 

Brown Betty. Pull half a loaf of white bread to bits, or use bread crumbs. 
The pulled bread makes the lighter pudding. Butter the inside of a pudding 
dish liberally, put in a layer of crumbs, then twice as much sliced apple or 
other fruit, sprinkle with sugar, nutmeg and bits of butter, add another layer 
of crumbs, and so on, for about three layers, having the crumbs last. Bake 
until brown, and the fruit well done, or about twenty minutes. Serve with 
cream.

Consomme Valentienne. Make some small dumplings of cream puff paste 
and boil in salt water for two minutes. Cook some lettuce, cut Julienne style, 
in consomme. Boil some Italian paste. Serve equal parts of each in boiling 
consomme. 

Suggestions and recipes for preserves, jellies and pickles. For jelly select 
your fruit before it is too ripe, as the flavor will then be much better. Put it 
on the stove and bring to a heat, to facilitate the easy extraction of the juice. 
Have a funnel-shaped bag made of flannel, to strain the juice through. The 
first time it is strained use a wire sieve with a revolving wire to crush the 
fruit. The juice should always be strained twice, and the second time if the 
flannel bag is used, and it is allowed to hang over night and drip, it will be 
much clearer. Put on the juice over a good fire and allow it to come to a 
heat, then add the sugar, which should be first heated in the oven. Boil 
rapidly in a pan with a very large bottom, so that as much surface can be on 
the stove as possible. If it is desired that the color be light add a little gelatine. 
From fifteen to twenty minutes is long enough to boil it, but it should not 
stop boiling during this time. Better success will probably be had if the jelly 
is cooked in small quantities. After pouring the jelly in glasses set in the hot 
sun until set, and then cover with melted paraffine. 

If corn starch be put in the juice before adding the sugar it will make it 
clearer. Use two teaspoonfuls in two tablespoonfuls of water, to three pints 
of juice. A teaspoonful of sugar on top of jelly, in the glass, prevents moulding. 
(To one pint of juice Ij^lbs. sugar). 

Preserves. Small stone jars are best for preserves. If glass jars are 
used they should be wrapped in paper to exclude the light. To prevent pre- 
serves from sugaring add a little tartaric acid after they are cooked. 

Pickles, Cider vinegar is best for pickles. If vinegar is too strong dilute 



132 THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 

it with water. The pickles should be tightly sealed to prevent the air reaching 
the vinegar, as this kills it. The vinegar should always be poured on hot, 
just as it comes to the first scald — never allowing it to boil. 

Never put up pickles in anything that has held grease; and never let 
them freeze. If pickles are put into brine it should be strong enough to bear 
an egg. To make the brine, use a heaping pint of salt to each gallon of water. 
Put the pickles in bottles, and seal while the brine is hot. A half bushel of 
grape leaves added to the barrel of salt pickles will keep them sound and firm. 
A slice of horseradish added to each jar or bottle of vinegar pickles will ke^ 
the vinegar clear.

bottle of Chili sauce, pour on a platter and lay the tripe on top. 

Preserves. Amount of fruit required. Seven and one-half pounds of 
cherries and seven and one-half pounds of sugar will make one gallon of 
preserves. 

Fourteen pounds of berries and fourteen pounds of sugar will make five 
quarts of jam. 

Two quarts of stemmed currants will make two pints of juice. Added to 
two pounds of sugar it will make three tumblers of jelly. 

Always wash strawberries before removing the hulls, and then put in a 
colander to drain. Always select strawberries for their flavor rather than 
for their size. 

Strawberry preserves. Prepare a small quantity at a time to secure the 
best results. Make a syrup in a kettle with two pounds of cane sugar and 
half a cup of water. Drop the berries into it and cook rapidly for twenty 
minutes. Do not stir, but remove any scum which may arise. After twenty 



THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 133 

minutes remove the berries and put in tumblers. Cook the syrup to a jelly 
and fill up the tumblers with it. Allow to become cold before covering. 

Blackberry jam. Four quarts of blackberries, two quarts of nice cooked 
apples, four quarts of cane sugar. Boil for twenty-five or thirty minutes. 

Raspberry or loganberry jam. In making raspberry jam, if two-thirds 
red raspberries and one-third currants are used the jam will be better, as the 
berries alone do not contain enough acid. Loganberries are sufficiently acid. 
Mash the fruit well, and boil it for twenty minutes. Weigh, and to every 
pound of fruit use three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Boil until when some 
is placed on a saucer no juice will gather around it. Put in small jars or 
glasses, in the same manner as jelly. 

Canned strawberries. Wash well before hulling. Weigh, and to each 
pound of berries add one-quarter pound of cane sugar. Boil for fifteen min- 
utes. Put in pint jars and seal while hot. 

Apple jelly. Take ripe Belleflower, or other fine-flavored cooking apples. 
Cut in quarters and remove the cores. Drop in water as fast as cut, to prevent 
them from turning black. Add a little lemon juice to the water. When all 
are ready drain off the water, and put the apples in a copper preserving kettle. 
Pour a little water over them and cook until soft, then strain through a flannel 
bag. Boil the juice with an equal weight of sugar, until it jells, and pour 
while hot into jelly glasses. 

Blackberry jelly. Heat the berries to the boiling point, mash, and strain 
through a flannel bag. Add an equal weight of sugar to the juice, and boil 
briskly for twenty-five minutes. Pour into glasses while hot.

Cranberry jelly. To three quarts of cranberries add two pounds of gran- 
ulated sugar and one quart of water. Cook thoroughly, and force through a 
fine sieve. Cook the juice for fifteen minutes, and then pour into individual 
moulds. 

Crab apple jelly, and marmalade. To eight quarts of crab apples add 
three quarts of water. Boil slowly for an hour, adding more water to make 
up for evaporation. Strain through a flannel bag, but do not squeeze. Measure 
the juice and add an equal amount of sugar. Boil for twenty minutes, pour 
into glasses, and seal when cold. Make a marmalade of the remainder of 
the apples left in the bag, by pressing through a sieve, and then adding an 
equal amount of cane sugar. Cook until well done. Flavor with lemon or 
cinnamon. 

Apricot and peach marmalade. Cut some firm ripe apricots in half and 



THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 173 

remove the stones. Add a few spoonfuls of water and cook until soft. Strain 
through a sieve, and add three-quarters of a pound of cane sugar to every 
pound of fruit. Crack some of the stones and add the kernels to the fruit. 
Continue to stir and cook until it thickens. Then pour immediately into hot 
glasses. Allow to become thoroughly cold before covering. Peach marmalade 
may be prepared in the same manner. 

Brandied cherries. Select some fine Queen Anne cherries and cut off 
about half of the stem with scissors. Arrange the cherries in glass jars or 
bottles. Melt two and one-half pounds of granulated cane sugar with a very 
little water, being very careful not to let it scorch. Remove from the fire and 
add half a vanilla bean, then add slowly one gallon of brandy. When cold 
pour over the cherries, seal well, and keep in a cool place. 

Brandied peaches. Rub some sound white peaches with a crash towel 
to remove the down. Prick all over with a needle, drop in cold water, drain, 
put in a kettle, cover with fresh cold water, and add a small piece of alum 
the size of a hazelnut. Place over a fire, stir occasionally, and as they float 
to the surface of the liquid take them out and place in a pan of cold water. 
Drain, and arrange in quart glass jars. Pour over brandy enough to cover the 
peaches. 

Seal and put away in a cool place, and let stand for two weeks. Then 
drain off brandy into a kettle, and allow three pounds of sugar to each 
gallon of brandy. Stir well to melt the sugar. Pour this over the peaches, 
seal hermetically, and put away in a cool place. 

Preserved cherries. To each pound of stoned cherries allow one pound 
of granulated cane sugar. Crack some of the stones and tie the kernels in 
a piece of gauze, so they may be removed after the boiling. Then put all in 
a preserving kettle, boil, and skim, until the syrup is clear. Then put the 
cherries in jars ; boil the syrup a little longer, and pour over the fruit. 

Preserved green gage plums. Use a pound of sugar for each pound of 
plums. Have the fruit clean and dry, and prick all over to keep the skins 
from breaking. Melt the sugar with as little water as possible, and when 
boiling add the plums, a layer at a time. Boil for a few minutes, then lift out 
with a skimmer and place singly on a dish to cool. Continue in this way 
until the plums are removed. When the last layer is finished return the first 
ones cooked to the kettle, and continue in reverse order, and boil until trans- 
parent. Then take out and arrange closely in glass jars. When all are in the 
jars pour the hot syrup over them, and seal.

sherbet, or to make small fancy cakes, or for use in decorating cakes, pies, 
tarts, etc. 

How to cook sugar to a blow. Dissolve one pound of sugar in one gill 
of water, and put on fire to cook. After about five minutes of good boiling 
dip a skimmer into it and remove immediately. Let the syrup drain a little, 
and then blow through. If small air bubbles fly out the sugar is cooked to 
a blow. If no air bubbles fly continue cooking until they do. It may possibly 
require some time to get it right.

the same size. Lay the strips lengthwise of the pie. Add a few peeled 
blanched or parboiled pistachio nuts, then another layer of forcemeat, and so 
continue until the form is full. Cover the top with thin layer of larding pork, 
and then cover all with dough. Moisten the edges where the dough comes 
together, and close carefully, so there will be no leak. Cut a round hole in 
the center and insert a little chimney made of a small piece of stiff paper; 
otherwise the dough will close while cooking. Put in the oven and cook for

Calf's foot jelly. Parboil four calf's feet; allow to become cool ; put back 
in vessel with an onion and a carrot, a piece of leek, a piece of celery, one 
clove, a bay leaf, a sprig of thyme, a spoonful of whole black peppers, a gallon 
of water, a quart of white wine, and a small handful of salt. Boil until the 
feet are soft. Then strain the broth, let it stand for a couple of minutes, and 
then remove all the fat from the top. Put a spoonful of the broth on a plate 
and set on ice. If it sets too hard add a little water, if it is too soft boil down 
until it is thick enough to set. Then put six whites of eggs in a casserole, beat 
with a whip, add slowly to the broth, put on a slow fire and bring to the 
boiling point. This serves to clarify the broth. Then strain, and set to cool. 
If the broth is for invalids omit the spices and vegetables, use but a little 
salt, and do not clarify. The cooked calf's feet may be used for an entree, or 
for soup or salad. 

Eggs, Moscow. Poach six eggs, and set in ice box until cold. Then re- 
move the yolks carefully by making a very small hole, and letting the soft 
yolks run out. Fill the eggs with fresh caviar, roll in flour, then in beaten 
eggs, and finally in bread crumbs ; fry in very hot swimming lard or melted 
butter for a few seconds only ; or until the crumbs are yellow. Serve imme- 
diately on a napkin, with fried parsley, and two lemons cut in half.

jelly in the bottom, and set on cracked ice until it is firm. Cut some foie gras 
from a terrine with a spoon, and lay in the mould, then cover with a little 
more melted jelly, then another layer of foie gras, and so continue until the

green peppers, and one-third celery cut Julienne style. Place in a salad bowl, 
separately. In the center put some French dressing. Sprinkle with chopped 
parsley and chervil. 

Fillet of flounder, St. Avertin. Put four fillets of flounder in a pan, cover 
with water, add a spoonful of salt and the juice of a lemon, and boil for seven 
minutes. Then place on a platter, and cover with a pint of Hollandaise sauce 
to which has been added a spoonful of French mustard. Garnish with four

fat, put in casserole, add two fresh pig's feet, one soup hen, and three pounds 
of shin of beef, one bouquet garni, a handful of salt, and two gallons of water. 
Cook until the hen and beef are soft, when they may be removed. When the 
pig's feet are done take out the bone, the fat and the lean meat, so nothing 
is left but the skin. Cut the skin in small squares, or round pieces the size 
of a dime. Cut some carrots in the same shape, and boil in salted water until 
soft. Put one pound of chopped beef in a casserole, add the whites of six eggs, 
stir well, add slowly the strained broth, and bring to a boil. This will clarify it. 
Season with salt and Cayenne pepper to taste. Boil for fifteen minutes, strain 
through a cheese cloth into another pot, bring to a boil, and reduce slowly for 
half an hour. Mix two spoonfuls of arrow root and a cup of sherry wine 
well together, and let run slowly into the boiling broth. Boil again for ten 
minutes. Before serving add a glass of dry amontillado. The beef and the 
soup hen then may be used for salads, croquettes, or other purposes.

spoonful of puree of fresh tomatoes. Break two eggs in each dish, season 
with salt and pepper, and bake in oven. 

Kalter aufschnitt. Assorted cold meats, such as roast beef, ham, tongue, 
lamb, etc. Garnish with a lettuce leaf filled with potato salad, for each person. 

Chicken mulligatawney soup. Cut the breast from an uncooked soup 
hen, and cut in small squares of about one-quarter inch. Make about two 
quarts of broth from the bones and trimmings. Heat three ounces of butter 
in a casserole, add the cut-up breast of chicken, and simmer for five minutes. 
Then add an onion chopped very fine, and simmer again until yellow. Then 
add two spoonfuls of flour and one spoonful of curry powder, and heat through. 
Now pour in the strained chicken broth and a cup of rice, and boil slowly 
until the rice is cooked. Cut two apples in quarter inch squares, and simmer 
in butter until cooked, and add to the soup. Season with salt and pepper. 

To preserve limes. Remove the cores from the limes with a small tin 
tube made for the purpose. Then cover with salad water, using a large hand- 
ful of salt to the gallon. Soak for four or five hours ; then drain off the water, 
and throw the limes into boiling water. As soon as they are soft take them 
out, one by one, and drop them into cold water. Change the cold water sev- 
eral times. To turn the limes green again put two gallons of water in a copper 
pan, add two large handfuls of cooking salt, one cup of vinegar, and several 
handfuls of fresh spinach. Put the pan on the fire and boil for a few minutes, 
then put the limes in the pan, and boil up several times. Remove from the 
fire, and allow to stand until cold; when the limes will have resumed their 
natural color. Drain off the liquid and let the limes soak in fresh water for 
about fourteen hours, changing the water frequently. Prepare a fifteen degree 
syrup, testing with a syrup gauge or cooking thermometer ; and when boiling 
throw the limes into this, boil up, and then put into a vessel and leave for 
twelve hours. Then pour off the syrup, and boil it to sixteen degrees, pour 
it over the limes again, leaving it for twelve hours. Then drain and boil 
again to twenty degrees, pour over the limes, stand for twelve hours, and 



THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 205 

continue every twelve hours until thirty-two degrees are reached. Then boil 
for two minutes, and pour into small stone jars. Seal hermetically when cool. 

Jellied cherries. Stone three pounds of cherries. Crush a handful of the 
cherry stones, and tie in a gauze bag. Put a pound of currant juice on the fire, 
add the crushed cherry stones, and steep. Put the cherries in a copper pan 
over a slow fire, and reduce one-half. Then add three pounds of granulated 
cane sugar and the currant juice, after the gauze bag has been removed ; and 
boil steadily until a little tried on a saucer will not spread. Add half a gill of 
kirschwasser, and pour at once into jelly glasses. Place in a cool place, and 
when cold pour melted paraffine over the top and cover tightly. 

Candied lemon or orange peels. Put a sufficient quantity of lemon or 
orange peels on the fire with enough water to cover. Boil until soft to the 
touch, then drain, and put in cold water and soak for twenty-four hours, 
changing the water often. Then pour off the water, and put the peels in an 
earthern jar, covering with a fifteen degree boiling syrup. Use a syrup guage 
or cooking thermometer to determine the density. Let the peels stand for 
twelve hours, then pour off the syrup and boil it up to eighteen degrees. 
Pour again over the peels and let it set for twelve hours. Repeat this opera- 
tion six or seven times, gradually increasing the density of the syrup until it 
reaches thirty-two degrees. The last time prepare a fresh thirty-two degree 
syrup. Drain the old syrup from the peels, add them to the fresh boiling 
syrup, and boil up once. Then put the peels in stone jars or pots, cover with 
the syrup, and seal when cold. 

Fig jam. Select large white firm figs, remove the stems, and cut in 
quarters. Dissolve a half pound of sugar in a little water for each pound of 
figs. Bring to a boil, then add the figs and boil steadily until the marmalade 
coats the spoon and drops from it in beads. Then pour into hot jelly glasses. 

Blackberry cordial, for medicinal purposes. Heat and strain through 
fine cheese cloth some ripe blackberries. To one pint of juice add one pound 
of granulated sugar, one-fourth ounce of powdered cinnamon, one-fourth 
ounce of mace, and one teaspoonful of cloves. Boil all together for twenty 
minutes, strain, and to each pint add a jill of French brandy. Put up in 
small bottles. 

Vanilla brandy. Cut some vanilla beans very fine, pound in a mortar, 
put in bottles and cover with strong brandy. This is much better than 
ordinary vanilla extract.

Scrambled eggs, Lucullus. Put in a casserole one ounce of butter, and 
three truffles cut in dices about one-eighth inch square. Heat through, and 
then add eight beaten eggs, and one-half cup of cream. Season with salt and 
pepper, then scramble, and dish up on a china platter. Cut about a dozen 
slices of truffle, heat on a plate with the addition of half a spoonful of meat 
extract, and lay over the eggs. 

Galantine of capon. Split open down the back a good-sized fowl or capon, 
and remove every bone, being careful not to remove any of the meat, and not 
to cut the skin. Lay out flat on the table skinside down, and season with salt 
and pepper. Prepare a forcemeat with one pound of veal, and one and one- 
half pounds of lean pork. Strain through a sieve, season with salt and pepper 
and a little grated nutmeg, and add a pint of cream. Cut in small squares the 
tip of a smoked boiled beef tongue, one-half pound of white fat pork, one- 
quarter pound of ham, one-quarter pound of peeled pistache nuts, and four 
truffles. Mix thoroughly with the force meat, and put on top of the fowl. 
Close, by drawing both sides together, forming a big sausage. Roll very 
tightly in a towel or napkin, and tie with a string on both ends and twice 
around the middle. Cook in bouillon, stock or salted water slowly for from 
one and one-half to two hours. When cooked, untie, remove the cloth, roll 
tight again and re-tie. Set in the ice box for at least eight hours. Serve 
sliced in the same manner as sausage, and about one-quarter inch thick. Gar- 
nish with meat jelly and parsley in branches. Galantine of chicken, squab, 
etc., may be prepared in the same manner. 

Salade Cupid d' Azure. Cut alligator pears in slices, lay on a platter, and 
sprinkle with one chopped shallot, salt and pepper, one chopped green pepper, 
one spoonful of vinegar, and two spoonfuls of olive oil. Allow to stand for 
an hour. Cut two heads of well-washed romaine salad in two, and on each 
lay a slice of grapefruit, then a slice of alligator pear, then a slice of grape- 
fruit, and so continue until the romaine is full. Divide the dressing over the 
individual salads ; and if not sufficient, finish with French dressing. 

Consomme Trianon. To each portion of consomme royal add six slices 
of truffle cut in triangle shape. 

Mustard sauce. To one pint of cream sauce add two spoonfuls of French 
mustard, and mix well.

Eggs & la Patti. Make a chicken hash in cream and put on a platter. 
Lay four poached eggs on top, and one slice of truffle on top of each egg. 
Pour sauce Madere around the hash. 

Puff paste roses. Roll out some puff paste about one-eighth inch thick, 
and out with a star cutter. Brush over with a little water, and fold the points 
of the stars to the center. Bake, and when nearly done dust with powdered 
sugar, and return to oven to finish baking. The cakes will puff up like a 
rose. Fill with jelly and serve. 

Consomme Alexandria. Add one cupful of boiled white meat of chicken, 
cut in small dices, to three pints of consomme brunoise. 

Orange or lemon brandy, for flavoring. Peel very thin the yellow outside 
from oranges or lemons. The inner white skin is not good. Crush with a 
little granulated sugar. Put in a bottle and cover with strong brandy. In the 
same manner can be prepared the kernels of cherries, plums, apricots or 
peaches. Pound the kernels slightly before putting them in the brandy. 

Glace fruit. Be very particular in selecting the fruit. Cherries should be 
large and not quite ripe, and without blemishes; and the stones must be 
removed. Apricots and peaches should be of medium size, and almost green. 
Make as small a hole as possible when removing the stones. Pears should 
be peeled, and the stems left on. Figs should be green. Strawberries should 
be very green, but full grown ; wash and dry well, and leave the stems on. 
Nectarines should be green, and the stones removed. Any hard green plums 
may be used, but leave their stones in. Cut pineapple in thick slices, remove 
the core, and any brown outside spots. All fruit should be thoroughly washed 
and dried before being prepared. It is well to make new syrup for each kind 
of fruit. To make the syrup boil two pounds of granulated sugar and two 
gills of water for eight minutes. Put the fruit in the syrup piece by piece ; 
do not let it stop boiling ; and wait a few seconds between each piece, so the 
syrup will boil up over the fruit. Then remove piece by piece in the same 
order as placed in the kettle. Use a silver spoon or an aluminum skimmer to 
handle the fruit, and under no circumstances use a fork. Place the fruit on 



THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 225 

a thick piece of waxed paper, and set in a cool place. Repeat the process the 
next day, adding a pound of sugar and a gfill of water to the syrup of the 
day before. Allow the fruit to boil hard for a minute, and remove as before. 
This must be continued for about eight days before the fruit will have ab- 
sorbed enough sugar, and not be mushy. When the fruit is finished line a 
broad shallow stone jar with waxed paper, lay the fruit in singly, not allowing 
the pieces to touch, put waxed paper between the layers, and cover closely. 

Baked pears, for canning. Wash as many ripe, firm unspecked pears as 
will fill a baking pan. Fill the pan almost full of boiling water. Sweeten as 
though for immediate use. Set the pan in the oven, baste frequently, and 
turn the pears around so they will brown lightly and evenly. Add a few 
cloves and a small stick of cinnamon. When the pears are very tender and 
almost candied, pack in hot glass jars, and pour the boiling syrup over them. 
Be sure to have enough thick syrup to cover the fruit. Seal while hot. 
Should the water evaporate too much while cooking, add a little more from 
time to time.

cream sauce. In a buttered baking dish put one spoonful of cream sauce, 
then one-third of the fish ; cover with cream sauce ; then another third of the 
fish; cover with sauce; and then the remainder of the fish, and pour the 
remainder of the sauce on top. The sauce should be highly seasoned. Sprinkle 
the top with grated Swiss or Parmesan cheese, put small bits of butter on top, 
and bake in oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Sprinkle with the juice of 
two lemons, and serve from the baking dish.

roll in oil, and broil. When done place on a platter, and garnish with four 
stuffed tomatoes with rice, and four stuffed cucumbers (see index). Pour 
a little sauce Madere over the steaks. 

Consomm6 Medina. Boil six chicken livers in bouillon. When done, cut 
in Julienne style. Boil one-quarter pound of spaghetti until soft, cut in pieces 
one inch long, and add with the chickens' livers, to one and one-half quarts 
of very hot consomme. Serve grated cheese separate. 

Pickled nasturtion seeds. Select the small and green seeds, and put 
them in salted water; changing the water twice in the course of a week. 
Then pour off the brine and cover with scalding vinegar with a little alum 
in it. Use in salads.

of vinegfar add a teacup of sugar, one cup of salt, a teaspoonful of alum, and 
one-quarter ounce of cloves and black pepper. Bring to the boiling point, 
pour over the artichokes, and seal while hot. 

Pickled onions. Select very small white onions, peel them, and boil in 
equal parts of sweet milk and water for ten minutes. Drain well, place in 
glass jars, and pour scalding spiced vinegar over them immediately. Use no 
sugar, and no allspice in the vinegar as it would tend to darken the onions. 

Pickles. Take one hundred green cucumbers two inches long, or under; 
and peel as many small white onions as desired. Wash well, and put into a 
stone jar. Sprinkle plenty of table salt over them, and toss all about with 
the hands. Allow to stand for twenty-four hours, then drain off the liquor, 
place the cucumbers and onions in glass jars, and cover with spiced vinegar 
without sugar. Add a small red pepper to each jar. Seal hot.

of sugar, one quart of vinegar, one ounce of stick cinnamon, and one ounce 
of whole cloves. Boil the sugar and vinegar with the cinnamon for two min- 
utes. Stick one or two cloves in each peach, and put in the boiling syrup. 
When the peaches are done place in jars, and put others in the syrup to cook 
until all are done. Then reduce the syrup to half the original quantity, and 
pour over the fruit. Seal hot. Plums and pears may be pickled in the same 
manner. 

Green tomato pickle. Slice one peck of green tomatoes and one dozen 
large onions very thin. Put the tomatoes in a jar with salt sprinkled between 
layers, and allow to stand for a few hours. Put the onions in another jar, 
pour boiling water over them, and allow them to stand for a few hours also. 
Then squeeze the juice from both, and arrange them in a stone jar in alternate 
layers, sprinkling through them celery and mustard seed. Pour over all a 
quart of vinegar and a pint of sugar brought to a boil. It will be ready to use 
when cold. 

Ripe cucumber sweet pickles. Pare twelve large ripe cucumbers, cut out 
the pulp, and cut them in strips. Boil together two pounds of sugar, one pint of 
vinegar, and one-half ounce of cinnamon and cloves. Skim well. Then put in 
the cucumbers, and cook until tender. Then remove the cucumbers, reduce the 
liquor, pour over the cucumbers, and cover tightly.

THE HOTEL ST. FRANCIS COOK BOOK 299 

Then remove the hen and cut the meat in half inch squares. Strain the 
broth, bring to a boil, and add two cupfuls of boiled rice and the chicken meat. 
Season well with salt and pepper, and add some chopped chervil. 

Merry widow cocktail. Use wide glasses. Put in the bottom the tails 
of six ecrevisses, or crawfish. Lay six asparagus tips on top, season with salt 
and pepper, and cover with plenty of mayonnaise. Set in tiie ice box as near 
the ice as possible, to chill thoroughly. 

Scallops k la poulette. Parboil the scallops from two to three minutes 
in their own juice, but not longer, as they will become tough and rubbery. 
Drain, and keep the juice. Heat two spoonfuls of flour and two spoonfuls of 
butter, and add the juice and, a little stock, making a thin sauce. Season with 
salt and pepper, add the yolk of one egg and two spoonfuls of cream, but do 
not boil. Mix in the scallops, and serve. Oysters and clams may be prepared 
in the same manner. 

Cranberry water ice. Cook the berries in a very small quantity of water 
in a granite or porcelain lined kettle, as otherwise the berries will become 
discolored. Then strain the cooked berries through a hair-sieve, making a 
thin puree. To every quart of berries add the juice of two lemons. For each 
quart of berries dissolve a pint of sugar in a cup of water, and add to the puree. 
Taste to see if sweet enough. Freeze in the same manner as other water ices. 
Serve as an ice, for dessert, or between courses; although the latter manner 
of serving ices is going out of vogue.

one-half teaspoonful of English mustard, a little salt, pepper and celery salt. 
Stir until the butter melts. Then add a teacupful of very finely chopped 
celery, and stir well until the celery is nearly cooked. Then pour in slowly, 
while stirring, one pint of rich cream, and allow to come to the boiling point. 
Then put in a dozen freshly opened oysters and cook for four or five minutes. 
Add a tablespoonful of good sherry or Madeira, and serve on very hot plates. 

Spoon or mush, bread. Scald two cups of com meal in two cups of boiling 
water, allow to cool slightly, then add one cup of buttermilk, one teaspoonful

of the potato. Thin with sweet milk, flavor with ginger and spices, or vanilla 
can be used. Beat the eggs well before adding to the mixture. Bake in a 
moderate oven very slowly. The potatoes in the west are not as sweet as the 
southern variety, therefore more sugar may be required. A good rule is to 
bake a small portion first to see if the flavor is right. It is considered a luxury 
in certain parts of the South. 

Loganberry ice cream. Put in a pan one quart of milk and one-h»ll 
pound of sugar, and place on the fire. Mix the yolks of sixteen eggs with 
one-half pound of sugar. Stir the milk and sugar, after it has reached the

but do not let it boil. Then remove from the fire, add one quart of cream, 
strain and freeze. When nearly frozen add one quart of bottled logan- 
berry juice, and finish freezing. A few drops of red coloring can be added 
if a bright color is desired.

Puff paste crescents. Two pounds of flour, one pound of butter, one pint 
of milk, one ounce of salt, one and one-half ounces of sugar and two ounces 
of yeast dissolved in warm water. Mix one-half pound of the flour with one- 
half pint of water and the dissolved yeast. Stand in warm place for about 
twenty minutes. Put the remainder of flour on board and mix in the yeast 
paste; when sufficiently risen, add salt, sugar and milk, make a stiff dough 
and allow to stand for a few minutes. Roll out, put the butter into the dough 
as for ordinary puff paste, and roll in the same way, but giving it only half 
the number of turns.

thick, and place in the center one pound of butter, well-worked and flexible. 
Fold the edges of the paste over the butter and roll out about one-quarter 
inch thick, taking care that the butter does not run out of the dough. Brush 
off the flour and fold in three. Roll out again to the same thickness as be- 
fore and repeat the folding. Put in cool place or ice box for about one-half 
hour, then roll and fold as before. Again rest for one-half hour, and then roll 
and fold again. The paste will then have six turns in all, and after a little 
rest it can be used. 

Brown gravy. One pound of veal bones, cut in pieces and browned in 
oven, with one carrot, one onion, a little thyme, one bay leaf, two cloves and 
three ounces of butter. Baste well, then add three ounces of flour, allow to

salt and pepper, cover with a light cream sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese, 
and bake in oven for about eight minutes. 

Pont Neuf potatoes. Three times the size of regular "French" fried po- 
tatoes.

sliced onion, one carrot, a little parsley, a bay leaf and a clove, and a few pep- 
per berries. Put three parboiled sweetbreads, which may be larded with fresh 
or salted pork if desired, on top, add one-half cup of bouillon, salt, and put 
over fire to boil. When reduced place in oven, add a small quantity of meat 
extract, and glace by basting continually with its own broth, until well 
browned. When done lay on platter and strain the broth over them. 

Bisque d'ecrevisses. Remove the tails of three dozen ecrivisses. Use two- 
thirds of the shells, broken up, to make the soup, and one-third for ecrevisse 
butter. Simmer in butter one onion, one carrot, a leek and a little celery, all 
cut up ; with one bay leaf, some thyme and one spoonful of black pepper ber- 
ries. Then add the broken shells, two spoonsful of flour, one glass of white 
wine, one-half glass of brandy, one gallon of bouillon and one cup of raw rice. 
Season with salt and Cayenne pepper, cook till rice is very soft, and strain 
through fine sieve. Bisque should be a little thicker than other cream soups. 
Before serving add two spoonsful of ecrevisse butter and stir well, then add 
the ecrevisse tails and one-half glass of Cognac. 

Ecrevisse butter. Break fine in mortar some ecrevisse (crayfish) shells.

a small piece of celery, one-half of a leek stalk, a little thyme, one bay leaf and 
a few pepper berries, and simmer in oven till butter is clarified, or clear, and 
all the other liquids evaporated. Squeeze through cheese cloth into a bowl 
standing in ice. The butter will rise to the top, and may be easily removed 
when cold. This butter is used with many sauces, soups, etc.

ecrevisse butter. This butter is used for lobster sauce, Newburg dishes, 
soups, etc.

The Epicurean 

By Ghas. Ranhofer 

An AU-Around Cook Book for the Kitchen, Pastry 
Room, Pantry, Storeroom, and Beverage Room 

The opening chapter is on "Table Service," and leads off with the arrangement of the bill of fare, 
tollowed with a chapter on wines, including a list of the different wines appropriate for the different 
ODurses, and the wines usually called for at dinners of Americans, Frenchmen and Germans, respectively. 
Ihis IS followed by a system of menu-compiling for course dinners ranging from 4 to 36 covers, and 
stating the time it should take to serve the dinners. 

How to lay and decorate the table; the seating of the host and guests; the fixing of the sideboard; the 
duties of the steward and waiters; dinner table etiquette, the manner of serving the different courses, 
including wines, and the windup with the tea service are cleverly explained. The French and Russian 
service are explained and a list is presented of the china, glassware, silver, etc., required for a dinner 
of twenty-four persons. Next comes valuable information regarding breakfasts, luncheons and suppers. 

Note the Diversity of the Contents 



There is a table of supplies in which is given the French 
and English names of the foods and the time of year each 
is in season. This table includes "fish and shell fish," 
"poultry," "fruits," "game," "meats," and "vegetables." 
This is followed with a model market list to show at a 
glance quantities received, on hand, and needed. 

We have so far got to page 24 and we come to "Bills of 
Fare." These occupy J 44 pages and present specimens for 
breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, buffet or standing suppers, 
collations, hunting parties, garden parties served ambigue,. 
sit down suppers, and dancing parties, including the re- 
freshments and supper. Every dish is numbered to corre- 
spond with a recipe for its preparation in another part of 
the book, the 3,715 recipes given being all represented in 
these bills of fare. 

Next comes a chapter on "Elementary Methods," in 
which is taught such information as how to peel almonds, 
to blanch vegetables, to make paste borders, to prepare 
bouchees, to braise, bread, carve, mold jellies, make vege- 
table colors, prepare different style creams, make puff paste, 
beat up eggs, clean fish, prepare forcemeats and bread 
stuffing and gelatines, grate cheese, cook icing, prepare 
jellies, cut fat pork for larding, lard meat, poultry and 
game, cut lemons, dress meringues, make mince ^ meat, 
flute mushrooms, stone olives, fix parsley for garnishing, 
make almond and many other pastes; press meats, gela- 
tines, breasts, sweetbreads, etc., prepare quenelles, clean 
currants, reduce and strain sauces, prepare rissoles, cut 
roots with a spoon and with a vegetable cutter; to prepare 
salpicon; to scald and sieve; the use of spices, aromatics 
and seasonings for cooking purposes; to cast and color 
stearine, to strain purees, cook sugar, make^ tarts; make 
thickenings for soups, sauces and stews; to line and bake 
timbale crusts, brush and peel truffles, dress, singe and 
truss poultry and game for entrees and roasting; make 
vol-au-vent crust, white stock for meats and vegetables, 
etc., etc., etc. 

Then follows a chapter on "Kitchen Utensils," in which 
about every known article of kitchen furniture and equip- 
ment (when the book was written) is described and illus- 
trated. This includes the cold storage department, as well. 
Next comes the department of "Soups," of which the mak- 



ing of two hundred kinds is explained. This is followed by 
"Sauces — Stocks, Essences and Auxiliaries," for which 251 
recipes are given. Following the sauces is a department 
of ' garnishings," for which there are 133 recipes. Next 
is a chapter on "Side Dishes," in which recipes for 63 
cold and 158 hot are given. Then follows a chapter on 
"MoUusks and Crustaceans," with 101 recipes. A chapter 
on "Fish" comes next with 218 recipes. This is followed 
with chapters on "Beef," 165 recipes; "Veal," 165 recipes; 
"Mutton," 75 recipes; "Lamb," 109 recipes: "Pork,''^ 48 
recipes; "Poultry," 224 recipes; and "Game," 163 recipes. 
As yet we have got only about half way through the book. 
The next chapter is headed "Miscellaneous Entrees," and 
gives 198 recipes. Next is a department of "Cold Service," 
including garnishings for cold dishes, the making of cooked 
salads, cooked and raw vegetable salads, green salads, etc. 
There are 267 recipes in this department. Following 
comes a chapter on Vegetables," with 172 recipes. Then 
one on "Eggs," with 100 .different ways of cookmg. Then 
comes a chapter headed "Farinaceous," with 37 recipes. 
This is followed with "Sweet Entremets," of which there 
are recipes for 134 hot and 99 cold. 

We now come to the "Pastry," beginning with large 
cakes for entremets, 40 recipes; breakfast cakes, 19 reci- 
peSf small cakes for entremets. 52 recipes; tea cakes, 24 
recipes; and fancy cakes, 40 recipes. 

Next is the "Bakery" department with 17 recipes, to- 
gether with full information regarding utensils, yeast, fer- 
ment, leaves, etc., etc. 

Then follows a chapter on "Ices," including "Iced 
Drinks," with 189 recipes. Following this is a depart- 
ment of "Confectionery,^' with 90 recipes, including large 
?ieces, candies, preserves, salted almonds, cheeses and 
resh fruits, chocolate, coffees, raccahout, teas, etc. 

Then follows a very interesting chapter on "Wines," 
with information regarding the care of bottling, clarifying, 
decanting, and freezing; punches, dessert, drinks, etc. 

This is followed with a pictorial display of "last century" 
tables, and a "Collection of Delmonico's Menus," occupy- 
ing 64 pages of the book. 

The volume ends with a comprehensive index occupying 
44 double column pages. 



The book is profusely' illustrated — there being no less than 806 cuts interspersed among the 
reading matter. The pictures are very good of their kind, too. Another most excellent fea- 
ture of this great cook book is that every recipe in it appears under a good, honest English 
name, alongside of which is the translation of it into the French.

Clarenbach's Hotel Accounting $3.00 

In writing this book it was Mr. Clarenbach's purpose to 
outline a simple system of hotel accounting that would 
meet the neec^ of the average hotel, particularly of ho- 
tels from 60 to 200 rooms. His first book was published 
in 1908 and the system was adopted by thousands of ho- 
tels. Since then there have been two revisions to meet 
new conditions of the more modern hotels. This is the 
third revision, thoroly up-to-date, and with illustrations 
that show the actual account books rulings and facsimile 
entries ; and the text matter is so clear that one need not 
be a practical bookkeeper to understand. The book is in 
four parts, these covering all departments. It shows how 
to get the storeroom "per dollar" costs ; how to handle the 
cigar business ; how to get an accurate statement of the 
hotel's business from month to month, and a method of 
auditing the front office. A ''Profit and Loss" statement 
is shown. The text matter emphasizes the importance of 
being accurate, of a check on every transaction, and the 
economy of doing things the right way, thus preventing 
vexatious mistakes that take valuable time in making 
corrections, and giving the operator the satisfaction that 
comes from being master of his business. Hotels now 
having workable accounting systems can find in the Glar- 
enbach book ideas that may be incorporated by them to 
advantage. Also they will find the Clarenbach system 
elastic, and its results can be put on a comparable basis 
with results obtained from other systems of hotel ac- 
counting. The book is supplemented with a chapter head- 
ed "An outline of the front office methods of the largest • 
hotel in the world." The book is 9x12 inches and contains 
66 pages, printed on ledger paper, attractively bound in 
cloUi cover. 

Front Oifice Psrchology (Heldenbrond) $1.00 

This is the only book that outlines rules of conduct for 
the people in the front office who meet the public, where 
a pleasing personality and correct habit of deportment, 
speech, dress, and all-around cleanliness makes for ideal 
salesmanship. The suggestions are classified under dif- 
ferent heads as Employee relations. Your personality. 
Receiving and rooming guests, Handling of mail. Infor- 
mation, Checking out. Front office tactics. The book is 
written from the practical viewpoint of a, student of 
human nature, and in this respect is a classic. It inspires 
to an improvement in service and can be read with profit 
by young and old in the small or the large hotel, or insti- 
tution, or business house. Pocket size, 6x8 inches, 100 
pages. Attractively bound in waterproof cover. (A special 
price is made to hotels and chains of hotels buying in 
quantities of ten or more.) 

The BeU-Bo7's Guide (Heldenbrond) $1.00 

This book was written with the object of training young 
men of good habits in the duties customarily performed 
by bell-boys. It was prepared by the author to instruct 
those not familiar with hotels in the particular bell-boy 
work required for his own hotel — the Hotel Heldenbrand 
of Pontiac, Michigan. With slight variation this book will 
meet the needs of the average hotel thruout America. It is 
pocket size, 32 pages. (Package of four books for $1.00.) 

The Epicurean (Ranhofer) $7.00 

The king of cook books is "The Epicurean," by Charles 
Ranhofer. of Delmonico's. This book is 1,200 pages and 
weighs about ten pounds. It is the most extensive, the 
most complete, the most readable, the most attractive 
and the best all-around cook book that has ever been pub- 
lished. The first chapter is devoted to table service, with 
instruction in menu-making and tJie care and service of 
wines, the decoration of the table, the fixing of the side- 
board, complete dining room instructions for the service 
of course dinners. French and Russian service is ex- 
plained. There are lists of china, glass and silver, etc. ; 
a table of supplies in which the French and English 
names are given, and a market list. Then follows 144 
pages of menus for breakfasts, luncheons, dinners, buffet 
or standing suppers, collations, hunting parties, garden 
parties, dancing parties, etc. All dishes in these menus 
are numbered to conform with recipes for them in the 
body of the book. There is a chapter on elementary meth- 
ods, in which even the drudgery work in the kitchen ifl 
explained, and all the work done by apprentices in the 



early stages of hotel kitchen work. The chapter on kit- 
chen utensils is very full, every utensil illustrated. Then 
come the recipes: 200 soups, 261 sauces. 138 garnishes, 
.191 side dishes. 101 shell fish, 218 fish, 165 beef, 166 veal, 
76 mutton. 109 lamb. 48 pork, 224 poultry, 163 game, 198 
miscellaneous entrees. 267 salads, 172 vegetables, 100 
eggs, 37 farinaceous foods. 233 sweet entrees, 170 cakes, 
17 breads. 189 ices and iced drinks, 90 confectionery, and 
several illustrations of centerpieces. There is an exhaus- 
tive chapter on wines, several recipes for mixed drinks, 
and 64 pages devoted to a collection of Delmonico menus. 
The index occupies 44 double-column pages. There are 
more than 800 illustrations. A most excellent feature of 
The Epicurean is that every recipe in it appears under 
a good honest English name, alongside of which is the 
translation of it into French. It is beautifully bound in 
Eeratol Levant grain, embossed in gold. 

The Edgewcrter Beach Salad Book (Shirclifle). . .$5.00 

Contains more than 600 tested recipes for salads and 
salad dressings. Mr. Shircliffe has not only given the 
recipes, but in many cases has supplemented them with 
author's notes, calling attention to special health-giving 
features, and suggesting diets for the different ailments 
that afflict humans. He also takes opportunity to preach 
many a short sermon on the importance of right eating 
and what is best for health from the cradle to old age. 
He also intersperses much of himian interest in the way 
of anecdote, legend and historic events. In this way it is 
more than a cook book — it is readable to those who are 
not so much interested in how to make salads as In the 
enjoyment of them. The great charm of the book is the 
illustrations, which are from direct photographs in the 
natural colors, so that the dishes illustrated have the eye- 
appeal and the enticing qualities of the real dish. It is a 
book that fits into every kitchen — ^home. hotel, club, hos- 
pital, restaurant, lunch room, cafeteria, steamship, din- 
ing car, industrial catering plant, institution, army mess 
— in fact, wherever information is desired as to the why 
and how to prepare for the table. 

Salad Portfolio (Shircliffe) $2.00 

A set of beautiful illustrations of salads taken from the 
Edgewater Beach Salad Book. They are mounted on 
, heavy green cover stock, 11 x 16 inches, each showing 
three or four of the salads, and are suitable for framing. 
The portfolio may be used by the maitre d'hotel to assist 
him in selling party menus. The illustrations are so 
natural and appetizing that they make strong appeal to 
patrons when selecting the salad course for special
