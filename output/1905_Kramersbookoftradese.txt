INTRODUCTION 




HIS little book, "Kramer's Book of 
Trade Secrets," will recommend itself 
to all who desire, in a condensed form, 
full information for the manufacture 
of Flavoring Extracts, Baking Powders, Soda Foun- 
tain Syrups, Jellies, Jams, Preserves, Vinegars, all 
kinds of Ciders, Maple Syrup, Egg Preserving, etc., 
All formulas are practical and they are put in such 
shape so that persons of limited education can use 
them. In fact, it is a text book for the manufacturer, 
jobber and dealer. For lack of that information 
which this book contains, business men lose thou- 
sands of dollars every year.

VANILLA 



Vanilla Culture 

THE vanilla plant is a native of Yu- 
catan, and the Mexican plant is 
considered the best in the world. 
It is, however, cultivated all over Central 
America and most of the islands of the 
West Indies. It has been successfully 
introduced by the Dutch into Java and 
by the French into the island of Reunion 
(one of the Mascarene group in the In- 
dian ocean). The entire production of 
Central America approximately one hun- 
dred and fifty thousand pounds per an- 
num goes to the United States: that of 
Jamaica to England; of Java to Holland 
and Germany; and of Reunion to France. 
The Germans manufacture a substitute 
for vanilla from a species of a fir tree. 
The planters claim that true vanilla is 
absolutely harmless and that much of 
the poisoning which is frequentl}' the 
case from eating ice cream, is traceable 
to the use of the artificial German pro- 
duct. It is supposed to be analogous to 
wood alcohol, which is exceedingly poi- 
sonous. I know of a few manufactures 
in this country who use wood alcohol in 
the manufacture of vanilla and I can 
point to one small factory that is turning 
out hundreds of gallons of vanilla at a 
cost of only thirty cents per gallon; com- 
plete formula is given in full for making 
it on another page, but I wouldn't be 
guilty of turning out such a piece of 
goods. 

It is a curious fact that the sole use 
made of vanilla in England is for the 



manufacture of perfumes; while in the 
United States it is used for flavoring. 

The fruit of the vanilla is a pod, exter- 
nally resembling a bean pod, from six to 
twelve inches long and a half inch in 
diameter. It is a dark chocolate brown 
color, often nearly black, with a very 
strong characteristic vanilla odor. To 
tell whether it is ripe you must pinch it 
between your fingers. If it crackles it is 
ripe and must be picked, if left too long 
in the pod it become valueless. As soon 
as they are cut off they are thrown into 
boiling hot water and allowed to remain 
two or three minutes when they are 
wrapped in flannel cloths and laid in the 
sun until perfectly dry. They are then 
annointed with olive oil, still being left 
in the sun until they are perfectly dry, 
though they are frequently drawn 
through the fingers to keep them soft 
and pliable. After having gone through 
this treatment two or three times they 
are left in the sun for five weeks or until 
they are perfectly cured. 



Materials Used in Making Vanilla 
Extract 



In the bean we have the Mexican, 
Bourbon, South American, Tahite Vanil- 
lous or Wild California beans, sometimes 
called Pomponas. 

B 

Artilicial Vanillin, Sugar, Glucose, 
Glycerine, Saccharine, Prune Juice, Va- 
nilla Resin, Vanilla, Benzoin, etc., etc.

Angostura Tonkas. 

Surinan Tonkas. 

Para Tonkas. 

Artificial Cumarin, the flavoring prin- 
ciple of Tonka beans. 

Cocoa shells; Caramel or brown sugar 
color and other coloring matters. Cu- 
marin natural is obtained also from deer 
tongue and various other sources. 

All material entering into vanilla ex- 
tract is cheaper now than has ever been 
known before. Mexican beans are the 
highest priced, beans split in the ends in 
the curing are a little cheaper. Cut 
beans are still cheaper. Bourbons are 
worth perhaps two-thirds as much as 
Mexican. Tahites and Vanillous are not 
used by honest extract makers. 

Tonkas and Cumarin should never be 
used in making an extract labeled "Va- 
nilla." If used in combination with va- 
nilla and Vanillin the extract should be 
labeled "Vanilla and Tonka." 

Artificial Vanillin is now the principle 
source of vanilla flavor. It was discovered 
about thirty years ago and was sold first 
for $5.50 per oz., then reduced to $5.00, 
at which price it remained for nearly ten 
years; five or six years ago it went down 
to $2.00 per oz. This year it has sold as 
low as sixty five cents per oz., but it was 
adulterated with Acetanlid; a first-class 
grade has been sold as low as seventy- 
five cents per ounce in large quanity. 

Angostura Tonka vary in price, some- 
times reaching $2.00 to $2.50 per lb., they 
now can be had at 75c. to $1.00 per lb. 
Surinams and Paras are cheaper, but the 
principle source of Tonka flavor is arti- 
ficial Cumarin. Cumarin was first sold 
for twenty-five dollars per pound, it is 
now worth about $4.50 per pound. You 
will observe a white crystal on the Mexi- 
can and Bourbon, that is a true Vanillin. 
During the last year this part has been 
adulterated, so a cheap bean has been 
sold for fancy stock. 

Natural Vanillin is not now, and never 
was an article of commerce, all state- 
ments to the contrary are false. 



The crystals which you will notice on 
the Tonka beans are natural Cumarin — 
it is often collected from the bottom of 
casks that have contained Tonkas and 
sold much higher that the artificial but 
it is not any better, perhaps not quite so 
uniform and satisfactory to work. 

Vanillin and Cumarin therefore are 
the proper materials to be used in the 
making extracts of vanilla and Tonka. 
Tonka beans have almost gone out of 
use for extract making and are chiefly 
used by tobacconists. Vanilla beans are 
still used for the most part to meet the 
requirements of the food laws.

Add water enough to make one gallon. 
This is a fine vanilla extract and will 
give the best practical results. It would 
please some better if it contained two or 
three pints of alcohol instead of one, but 
this would add to the cost of the extract 
without really adding to its value. This 
is the proper thing to use for ice creams 
and all cold works, but for cooking, bak- 
ing, and where heat is involved Tonka, 
that is to say Cumarin, should be em- 
ployed.

This will cost 80 cents per gallon, the 
six pints of glycerine could be replaced 
with six pounds of sugar still reducing 
the cost. Some eight or ten years ago a 
New York house made vanilla by the 
above formula and sold it in large quan- 
tities at 812.00 per gallon. One of the 
largest extract houses in Chicago now 
make it under the name of Baker's Va- 
nilla and sells it at prices varying from 
live to six dollars per gallon. 

I will insert here a formula for a pure 
Vanilla (Bourbon beans), but will have 
more to say regarding Vanillin.

Take Hlb. medium Vanilla Bour- 
bons at say S5.00 per lb $ 2.50 

% gallon alcohol 1.25 

1 II). sugar 06 

% 3.81 
Cut the vanilla beans very fine and put 
into any suitable bottle or other recep- 
tacle that can be corked or covered, pour 
on one-half gallon water, let stand a few 
hours; then add alcohol and let stand at 
least ten days with frequent shaking or 
stirring, then filter and add sugar in 
form of syrup after filtering. 

It would be better to keep this a 
month, still better to keep it a year, be- 
fore filtering, but don't throw away the 
bean; put it into some convenient recep- 
tacle and let it stand and macerate, keep- 
ing it covered with alcohol and water, at 
least 25 per cent alcohol, or put it into a 
percolator and don't throw it away until 
exhausted, that is, until it will yield no 
more color or flavor. This extract will 
cost $3.81 per gallon. 

An extract in which much vanilla bean 
is used should contain 50 per cent alco- 



hol. Less than that will not properly 
dissolve the resin and in the vanilla 
more than 50 per cent is unnecessary. 
An extract containing one-half pound 
vanilla to the gallon will be a pretty good 
color. Tahites, vanillins, cocoa shells 
and prune juice are used to give color 
and body in the food law states, espe- 
cially in Michigan where it is contrary to 
law to color vanilla; but I would advise 
you to avoid them altogether if possible 
as they add to the cost of your extract 
without adding anything to its value. 

I would advise you in labeling your 
extracts to draw the line sharply between 
pure vanilla or vanilla with vanillin, 
which is a true vanilla flavor, — and ex- 
tracts which contain Tonka or Cumarin 
— such extracts are all right, but they 
should be sold under their true names, 
food law or no food law. 

Rose, orange and all other extracts 
made from the pure oils need nothing 
special on the label, but the artificial ex- 
tracts must be labeled "artificial" in the 
food law states, and if colored must be 
labeled "colored." Their sale is prohib- 
ited in Michigan. 

I could show you a bottle of extract 
labeled vanilla and Tonka, made by one 
of the largest wholesale grocers in Chi- 
cago. It contains no vanilla and no 
Tonka. It is made from Cumarin with- 
out even the addition of anything more 
than a trace of vanillin, and is colored 
but not so labeled, and this in a pure 
food law state. Of course they make 
big money by doing this though if they 
do pay one or two fines. 

One of the largest extract houses in 
Chicago make an extract of which they 
sell from 50 to 100 gallons per week, thus: 

8 oz. Cumarin $ 2.00 

10 lbs. Sugar 2.00 

5 gallons Alcohol 12. 50 

1 gallon ( Jaramel 1.00 

Water to make 40 gallons 0.00 

This extract will cost you forty-four 
cents per gallon. The price could be re- 
duced considerable lower than the above 
by using only four gallons of alcohol in- 
stead of five gallons, or you might put 



KRAMER'S BOOK OP TRADE SECRETS 



in two ounces vanillin in with the above 
five gallons of alcohol formula and still 
keep the price under fifty cents per gal- 
lon. This would make a much finer 
extract and would be O. K. for baking 
and cold work. This Chicago firm sells 
it all the way from 82.00 to 83.00 per gal- 
lon, owing to quantity. They label it 
"Vanilla and Tonka, Colored." It should 
really be labeled "Vanillin and Cumarin, 
Colored" in a food law state. 



ing it seventy-two cents. The fifty cent 
article is alright and you ought to get 
82.00 to 83.00 for it. The seventy-two 
cent goods ought to bring more money. 



A 30 Cent Per Gallon Vanilla 

To make a thirty cent per gallon va- 
nilla, take 

34 oz. Cumarin 10 

1 lb. Sugar 06 

9 oz. Columbian Spirit (refined 
wood alcohol) 12 

1 oz. Caramel 01 

10 drops tincture artificial musk or 
civetol 01 

Water to make one gallon. 

This needs no treatment but to dis- 
solve the Cumarin in the alcohol, dis- 
solve the sugar and caramel in the water 
and mix all together. 

A certain Iowa house are putting out 
a good many gallons per week of this 
grade and are making 83,000 per year off 
this vanilla alone. Wood alcohol is an 
absolute poison and in using it in large 
quantity it would destroy the optic nerve 
and produce blindness. Don't be guilty 
in putting out such a piece of goods and 
you will keep out of trouble, but if you 
want something better try the following: 



Vanilla at 39 Cents Per Gallon. 

Take: 

34 oz. of Cumarin .10 

12 oz. Grain Alcohol 22 

1 lb. Sugar 06 

Caramel 01 

This makes a vanilla which will cost 
thirty-nine cents per gallon. To make it 
a little better you may add 3 s ounce va- 
nillin, 10 cents, making; it cost forty-nine 
cents per gallon. This will make a very 
satisfactory article. _ To make it still 
better use 34 ounce vanillin making it- 
sixty-one cents, or % ounce vanillin mak- 



True Vanilla. 

The above contains Cumarin which is 
the flavoring principle of Tonka. To 
make a true vanilla flavor from Vanillin 
use: 

1 oz. Vanillin 8 .75 

1 pt. Alcohol 35 

1 oz. Caramel 01 

Add water to make 1 gallon 00 

This would cost 81.10 per gallon and 
you find this No. 1 for ice cream or 
any cold work and you can't get any- 
thing better. To make it more ex- 
pensive and so as to take the fancy of 
one who thinks he is an expert in flavors, 
use one pint of tincture of Vanilla Bean 
to the gallon cost say 50 cents a pint, 
but for all practical use it does not in- 
crease its value very much. Or you may 
use two pints or three pints if you like. 
If you want to make a vanilla without 
artificial color use still more, say one-half 
gallon or 50 per cent of vanilla tincture 
from bean. 

Vanilla and Vanillin Extract 

Take 1 oz. Vanillin % .75 

1 pt. alcochol 35 

1 lb. Sugar 06 

1 oz. Caramel 01 

Water to make 1 gallon 00 

Then add tincture of vanilla enough 
to raise the cost to 81.50, 81.75 or 82.00 
per gallon and you will have a true va- 
nilla for ice cream and cold work equal 
the finest in the market. This is extra 
fine and ought to sell for five or six dol- 
lars per gallon. 



A $2.00 Vanilla Extract 

Take 1 oz. vanillin say 8 .75 

1 pt. alcohol 35 

1 pt. sugar 06 

1 pt. good tincture or first infusion 
of vanilla bean, color with Cara- 
mel 69 

In the above you will have as good 
vanilla for any practical purpose as any- 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS

thing in the market. For sweetening 
some manufactures use Saccharine, now 
sold under the name of Garantose. 
Saccharine has been advertised as being 
550 times as sweet as sugar. It was sold 
as high as $20.00 a pound, but it has 
been condemned by the Russian govern- 
ment and some other European govern- 
ments as antiseptic and therefore unfit 
for food. It costs now about twenty-five 
cents per ounce or $3.50 per pound. 

Before I forget I desire to speak about 
vanillons. Vanillons has no flavor and is 
used by some manufacturers to give 
color, body, vanilla resin, etc., but would 
not advise its use. 



Tincture of Vanilla 

The rule for Tincture of Vanilla or 
first infusion vanilla bean is three-fourth 
pounds to one gallon of fifty per cent 
alcohol — cut up beans, pour on water 
one-half gallon, and let stand a few hours, 
then add alcohol one-half gallon, when it 
has stood say ten days, with occasional 
shaking, filter, add water to make full 
gallon — put weaker alcohol on exhausted 
beans for the second infusion, say one 
pint alcohol to two pints water. If you 
use an expensive bean use only one-half 
pound; if a cheap bean, one pound to the 
gallon. You must keep your old bean as 
long as it yields any flavor or color. You 
need not throw it away for two years. 



Vanilla Extract at 66c 

2 oz. Vanillin 6 1.50 

2 oz. Cumarin 00 

1 gal. Alcohol 2.50 

3 quarts Syrup 15 

i oz. Caramel 05 

Water to make five gallons 00 

This will make a good cheap extract 
and will give good satisfaction, it could 
be improved by adding at least two 
ounces of Benzoic Acid, but in pure food 
law states you would perhaps be com- 
pelled to put the Benzoic Acid on the 
label. 



Fancy Vanilla Extract at $3.11 

Take: 

1 lb. Bourbon cuts $ 3.60 

2 lbs Gran. Sugar 12 

1 gal. Alcohol 2.50 

1 gal. Water 00 

Cut up the beans in a chopping bowl, 
some use a sausage grinder, pour on 
water first, then after a few hours, not 
more than twenty- four hours at longest, 
pour on alcohol, let stand, with occa- 
sional stirring, for at least four or five 
days, filter off, then add sugar in the 
form of a nice clear white syrup, add 
water enough to make at least two gal- 
lons, costing 83.11 per gallon. 

The above will make an absolutely 
pure vanilla Or you may add water 
enough to make two and one-half gal- 
lons and one ounce of vanillin — then if 
color is too light add a little artificial 
brown color (not caramel) You will have 
a fancy vanilla the same which is being 
put out by a large Chicago extract house, 
the cost would be about 82.75 per gallon. 
This grade would sell easily for $7.00 or 
$8.00 per gallon. 

The following formula, which will cost 
$1.92 per gallon, will give better satisfac- 
tion. 
Take: 

1 oz Vanillin $ .75 

1 pint Alcohol 35 

1 pint first infusion of cheap Va- 
nilla Bean 50 

'1 to 1 oz. Caramel 01 

1 pt. second infusion Vanilla Bean .25 
Water to make 1 gal 00 

You might leave out the second infu- 
sion, making the cost 81.G7, or you could 
put in water enough, using a little more 
syrup also, to make one and one fourth 
gallons, costing $1.51 per gallon, and still 
have a vanilla that, for practical flavor- 
ing purposes, would be equal to the for- 
mula which cost $3.11. 

Or you might leave out the vanilla 
beans altogether, making your extract 
thus: 
1 oz. Vanillin $ .75 

1 pt. Alcohol :;;, 

J pt. Syrup in; 

Water to make one gallon 00 



10 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



This formula would cost $1.16 per gal- 
lon and still you will have a vanilla bet- 
ter than most of the pure vanillas in the 
market, one that will give splendid re- 
sults in ice cream and all cold work (but 
for hot work remember that Cumarin is 
necessary). 



A 6oc Vanilla Extract 

Take: 

2oz. Vanillin $1.50 

1 oz. Cumarin 30 

1 gal. Syrup of Sugar, white 50 

1 gal. Alcohol 2.50 

Add water enough to make eight gal- 
lons. Color with caramel. 

This will cost 60c per gallon and will 
make a good standard extract. If vanilla 
is not strong enough add a little more 
cumarin. 

Extract of Vanilla Cost $4.25 

Take: 
2>% lbs. Bourbon beans at $6.00 per lb. 
2% lbs. Gran. Sugar. 
214 gals. Colonge Spirits, 188 per cent. 
1% gals. Water. 

Proceed same as formula for Extract 
of Vanilla to cost $3.11 per gallon. 



Vanilla and Tonka 

8 oz. Tonka beans. 

Marc left from above formula which 
cost $1.25 per gallon. 

1% S^ s - hot water. 

1 pt. simple syrup. 

3 qts. alcohol. 

1 oz. caramel. 

Cut up the Tonka beans and bruise in 
a mortar, pour one-half gallon of boiling 
water on them, cork or cover up, skim 
off any fat that may arise, strain and set 
aside. Stew the marc left from above 
formula for half an hour with a gallon 
of water in a tightly closed vessel, strain 
when cold and add three quarts of alco- 
hol, one pint of simple syrup, sugar, col- 
oring and the Tonka extract. Mix well 
and filter. 



Pure Vanilla Extract 

If you want a vanilla for fancy trade 
and for a class of people that don't care 
for price, try 

12 ozs. Mexican bean, cost $10.00 per 
pound. 

1^ lbs. sugar. 

80 ozs. alcohol. 

48 ozs. water. 

Proceed to make the same as in 
formula which cost $3.11. If you desire 
to make the extract stronger and bring 
the cost down you may use 8 oz. Vanilla 
beans and 4 oz. Tonka beans. 

Be careful in using container in which 
you make your extract, a wine keg will 
no doubt do if thoroughly steamed or 
rinsed with hot water, but a brandy keg 
is better. Do not grind your beans in a 
mill which is being used for spices, for 
small quantity use a chopping bowl. 
Some use a sausage grinder. 



LEMON 



THE lemons are taken to the labora- 
tory and each is cut lengthwise 
into three slices. The pulp is first 
removed and put into a press when it is 
squeezed in order to obtain the lemon 
juice, which is sold in its natural concen- 
trated state to the manufacturers of cit- 
ric acid. The residue of the pulp is used 
for animal food. The peel is put into 
large baskets, which are stored in a cool 
place for some hours, when it is ready to 
be pressed. Each workman holds in his 
left hand a medium sized sponge of super- 
fine quality, which has been previously 
washed most carefully and thoroughly. 
Between the fingers of the same hand he 
has also small sponges to prevent the loss 
of any of the oil, which is very volatile. 
With the right hand the workman takes 
a piece of peel from the basket, which 
is kept in easy reach, and squeezes it 
against the sponge, thus forcing the oil 
through the pores of the rind into the 
sponge or sponges. When the sponge is 
full of essence it is squeezed into a tin 
lined copper bowl having a lip, which 



KRAMER'S BOOK OP TRADE SECRETS 



11 



every workman has before him. In 
order to make sure that the peel has 
yielded all the essence that can be pressed 
by the hand, the overseer from time to 
time takes the rejected by squeezing it 
close to a flame. (We have seen chil- 
dren try the same experiment with peel 
after having eaten their oranges.) This 
is hand pressed peel and is then put into 
brine and sold to manufacturers of can- 
died lemons. When the tin lined copper 
bowl is full it is set aside for a short time 
to permit the impurities to settle, after 
which the bowl is slowly and carefully 
decanted and the clear essence emptied 
into large tin lined copper vessels. Be- 
fore this is put into the various sized 
coppers for shipments, it is passed 
through filtered paper. This not only 
perfectly purifies it, but also gives it lim- 
pidity. The quantity and quality of es- 
sence yielded by the lemon varies accord- 
ing to the season. During November, 
December and January most of the 
essence is manufactured, about 1000 
lemons being then required to make one 
and one-half pounds of essence. Lemons 
not fully ripe are preferred as they yield 
a larger quantity and more fragrant 
quality of essence then those most fully 
matured. 

The principal materials to be used in 
making extracts of lemon are oil of lemon, 
ethyl alcohol, that is to say grain alcohol, 
which is the same thing as colonge 
spirits, the latter being only selected 
alcohol or what the distillers call the 
"middle run." 

Those persons who make extract of 
lemon or claim to make it from lemons 
or lemon peel, do so only through ignor- 
ance or fraud. Lemons are now grown 
in California, but the oil lemon made 
there thus far is of inferior quality and 
unfit to make a fine extract. The finest 
lemons come from Messina, Italy. The 
best oil of lemon is also made there. It 
must be plain to any one who thinks on 
the subject that it is cheaper to import 
the oil from Italy than to import the 
lemons and make the oil here. Of course 



a perfect lemon flavor should contain the 
oil from the oil cells in the rind and some 
of the citric acid contained in the juice, 
but no such extract is made, or if made 
would begin to deteriorate in less then 
twenty-four hours. 

Oil of lemon and the acid of the juice 
(Citric acid) are incompatible, and nature 
has recognized this fact by interposing a 
wall of pulp between the acid in the juice 
and the oil in the cells in the exterior of 
the rind or peel. Besides if lemon peel 
were used making extract as a great 
many receipt books direct, a bitter ex- 
tractive matter from the pulp would 
destroy the fine flavor of the extract. 

In all French, Italian and Spanish 
works on the subject lemon is called 
"essence of lemon" the word "essence" 
being equivalent in those languages to 
"essential oil." "Columbian spirit," or re- 
fined wood alcohol is used by many un- 
scrupulous makers of lemon extract, but 
its use for such purposes is punishable 
by fine or imprisonment in the food law 
states as it is a poison particularly in- 
jurious to the sight, the continual use 
will cause paralysis of the optic nerve 
and consequently blindness. Many ex- 
tracts improve with age, this is particu- 
larly true of vanilla. Some keep for an 
indefinite length of time rather improv- 
ing than otherwise, such as Cinnamon, 
Clove, Rose, Nutmeg, Almond, etc. Those 
made from ether keep well, especially if 
not exposed to strong light. But lemon 
and all citrine flavors such as Orange, 
Limes, Bergomot, etc., soon begin to 
deteriorate with age, especially when 
kept in a warm place or exposed to a 
strong light. Oil of lemon as obtained 
by expression, (oil of lemon should be 
pressed out, never distilled) consists of 
two distilled oils namely: 93 per cent 
terpene and 7 per cent citral. One pound 
of genuine natural citral costs as much 
as sixteen pounds of oil of lemon. Citral 
of inferior quality is obtained from oil of 
lemon grass and other sources, it is also 
produced synthetically, but the artificial 
or synthetic oil of lemon is poor stuff

and is not to be recommended. The food 
commission in the states of Michigan, 
Wisconsin and Illinois have examined 
and analyzed many samples of extract of 
lemon purchased in the open market and 
found some of them as Burnett's to 
contain over eight per cent true oil of 
lemon in about 95 per cent ethyl or 
grain alcohol, others of high gcade con- 
tain 4 per cent, 5 per cent, 6 per cent, 
etc.; others again % of 1 per cent, 1 per 
cent, 2 per cent, 1% per cent, etc. While 
some contained no true oil of lemon at 
all and less than 20 per cent alcohol, and 
in some cases "Columbian spirit" or re- 
fined wood alcohol In the food law 
states the law requires an extract of 
lemon to contain 5 per cent oil of lemon 
in ethyl alcohol, but does not prohibit 
the use of some water provided it can be 
worked in without reducing the per- 
centage of oil, neither do the food lawa 
prohibit coloring extract of lemon. Be- 
fore these laws came into operation the 
highest grade of extract were the most 
lightly colored and the cheaper and 
inferior grades colored more deeply. 
Some manufacturers of fine and high 
grade extracts use about eight fluid 
ounces of glycerine to a gallon of lemon 
extract. It is thought that this has a 
tendency to make the extract keep 
better. Cheap lemon is made by rub- 
bing the oil in magnesia and sugar, then 
rocking or churning the lemon for a 
couple of days after it is made and 
lastly washing out the oil which a low 
percentage of alcohol fails to take up. 
Citral or artificial oil lemon is also sub- 
stituted in whole or in part for oil of 
lemon, but of this I will speak of later 
on.

The terpenless oil may be omitted, and 
one-half or four ounces glycerine may be 
replaced by four ounces soft water. A 
great deal of talk is made about distilled 
water, but would not recommend you to 
use it unless you have a still of your own. 
The so-called distilled water taken from 
boiler condensers, etc., is poor stuff and 
not as good as pure rain or river water. 
Extract made according to the above 
formula needs no treatment except filter- 
ing and if you have no means of filtering 
you may let it stand a few days and then 
decant it. But then it is best to filter; 
the expense is trilling.

Pour the oil of lemon into a medium

ounces granulated sugar and 1 £ ounce to 
one ounce powdered carbonate of mag- 
nesia, orput in enough magnesia to make 
mixture about as thick as molasses, then 
rub for % of an hour to one hour; this 
makes the oil more soluble so that more 
water can be used; now pour on the alco- 
hol or put oil, etc., into large bottle or 
other suitable receptacle and add the 
alcohol. Shake and then add hot (not 
boiling) water and color with few drops 
of lemon yellow dissolved in alcohol or 
water. Some manufacturers use tinc- 
ture of tumeric for coloring. Water 
enough should be added to yield one 
gallon extract after Alteration. This will 
require about thirty-six ounces.

About one-eighth ounce or at most 
one-fourth ounce artificial concentrated

sugar and alcohol added and water last. 
If put into a churn (a revolving churn) 
with a small quantity of animal charcoal 
(powdered bone black) and kept in mo- 
tion for about an hour a good result will 
be obtained on filtering. This will make 
a good standard lemon extract. I know 
of one house that is putting out large 
quantities of it. Some manufacturers 
would use more oil, say two ounces to 
the gallon and churn the extract in re- 
volving churn, then they put it in sepa- 
rator and wash out the oil which the 
menstruum will not take up. This oil is 
then sold to bakers at about half of the 
price of new oil. 



Lemon Extract Cost $2.50 

The following formula will make a very

one large Chicago house at about 88.00 
per gallon. 

Take: 

6^ oz. Oil Lemon.

Magnesia and Sugar. 

Rub oil in mortar with two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar and some of magnesia for 
twenty to thirty minutes, pour on alco- 
hol, let stand twenty-four hours and fil- 
ter. I should have said that the water 
should be added gradually and if quite 
warm or even hot, but not boiling, all the 
better, you had better add twenty ounces 
of water to allow for what is absorbed by 
the filter paper and lost by evaporation. 
About one Jl u id drahm of lemon yellow 
color will be sufficient to color one gal- 
lon. In using color be careful or you 
may get in too much. The extract should 
be thoroughly shaken up and the mag- 
nesia and sugar distributed before you

KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS. 



pour extract into filter. After you have 
filtered this lemon and got your full gal- 
lon of extract you may wash the filter, 
that is to say let about a quart of clear 
water run through it and keep this fil- 
trate to be used as so much water in 
making your cheap lemon. If you put 
about a tablespoonful of bone black (ani- 
mal charcoal powder) into your filter it 
will clear it when it would not come 
clear without it. Six and one-half 
ounces to the gallon or six and four- 
tenths ounces would be the exact amount 
of oil of lemon in order to make a five 
per cent extract so as to pass in some 
food law states. About seven ounces 
ought to be put in as some is lost in fil- 
tration and by evaporation and in the 
analytical process itself. 

A lemon about as good as the above 
for practical flavoring purposes, and bet- 
ter for soda fountains, may be made thus:

This will cost §2.00 per gallon, but this 
will not go into food law states where 5 
per cent oil is required. All states do 
not require 5 per cent. Use water in the 
above formula as directed in other 
formulas.

per gallon. 
Take:

Use 4 heaping tablesponsful of sugar 
and about 5 or 6 heaping spoonsful mag- 
nesia — rub very thoroughly in mortar, 
and 5}4 or 5% pints water so that you 
will get off a full gallon of extract. If 
this is thoroughly rubbed for an hour or 
two it will be soluble, that is you can 
put it into water or add water to it with- 
out making it cloudy. To rub this oil of 
lemon in the manner above described an 
iron mortar is bv far the best — a half 



gallon mortar can be had for 75c, gallon 
for $1.25. A gallon would be the best to 
get for then when necessary you can rub 
a larger quantity at a time. The weight 
of the jestle is sufficient — no pressure 
required and the iron mortar is so deep 
that there is no splashing over the sides, 
etc. The wedgewood mortar is the best 
for general purposes and will do for oil of 
lemon, (but for that, iron is the best.)

By varying the proportions of concen- 
trated oil, natural oil and citral extracts 
can be made of almost any desired 
strength and delicacy of flavor. Citral 
undoubtedly enjoys some popular flavor, 
in just the same way that cumarin and 
tonka do. It serves much the same pur- 
pose in supplying a "strong" flavor at a 
low price. It is plainly discernible 
either in cooked or uncooked articles. 



Orange Extract 

Orange extract may be made in the 
same manner as directed for lemon. I 
think you could use a little less oil than 
in making lemon and perhaps a little 
more alcohol. Color with orange color 
or you may use one ounce tincture tu- 
meric and perhaps just a trifle of cara- 
mel. A good many manufacturers use 
only the tincture of tumeric for coloring 
orange. Other extracts made from es- 
sential oils may be treated in a similar 
way except that for some of them a 
much less amount of oil will be neces- 
sary. In making extract of Almond, for 
example: One ounce to one and one-half 
ounces oil per gallon is quite enough 
and 50 per cent, alcohol will be found 
sufficient, or, say 50 per cent, or 60 per 
cent, according to the amount of oil. In 
making Almond use genuine oil free 
from prussic acid. It will cost about 
$5.00 to 85.50 per pound; the artificial is 
worth about seventv-five cents per 
pound. 

Extract Cinnamon 

8 oz. Oil Cassia 

8 oz. water 

Alcohol 188 per cent q. s. for one gallon. 



Mix oil with seven pints alcohol; to 
this add the water which has previously 
been mixed with one-half pint alcohol. 
Or proceed as with lemon, using magne- 
sia. 



Extract Cinnamon 

Take: 

2 oz. Oil Cinnamon. 

l i gal Alcohol, 188 per cent. 

2 pints Water. 

Color with tincture of red saunders or 
use cinnamon color which is already pre- 
pared. Instead of rubbing oil and mag- 
nesia together you may use one ounce 
magnesia and put in filter and filter 
through magnesia. You may make any 
price of extract of cinnamon by using 
less quantity of oil and alcohol; also you 
may do the same with other extracts.

with about one ounce of Carbonate Mag- 
nesia and place in paper filter, pour on 
the alcohol and water over the seeds and 
the magnesia or you may macerate the 
celery with 1 pint alcohol and }/% pint of 
water for about 3 days and then put 
in percolator and mix balance of alcohol 
with about 2 pints of alcohol and pour 
upon the drug, when percolating is done 
run water through to make one gallon.

use more alcohol and also work in % oz. 
y z oz. or 1 oz. of oil of celery. 



ARTIFICIAL EXTRACTS 



BY artificial extracts it is understood 
those that are not made directly 
from the fruits, but from ether, etc. 
You can make orange and lemon artifi- 
cially, but I consider them very poor in 
comparison to those made from the 
natural flavors. 

In point of fact nearly all the flavors, 
all the odors and all the colors are now 
made artificially and can probably all be 
produced from the same material, that 
is to say from crude petroleum. It is a 
curious fact that in the cold measures 
there are stored up all the products of 
many centuries of sunshine and vegetable 
life and growth, all the heat of centuries 
of sunshine, all the colors of the sunlight, 
all the flavors of all the fruits and all 
the odors of all the flowers and that 
that most wonderful of magicians, the 
modern chemist is able to reproduce 
them all from crude petroleum. 

There has been a great demand for 
artificial extracts heretofore, but it seems 
to be rather less now. Their sale is pro- 
hibited in the state of Michigan, which 
is probably unwise, for they are not in- 
jurious, although in my opinion they are 

not very great value. 



Extract of Pineapple 

1 part Chloroform. 
1 part Aldehyde. 

5 parts Butyric Ether. 

10 parts Amyl Butyric Ether. 

3 parts Glycerine. 

These 20 parts will give you 20 oz., 
which you may call Oil of Pineapple. 
Make as follows: 

10 oz. Pineapple. 

10 oz. Tincture of Orris Root. 

4 pints Alcohol. 
1 pint Syrup. 

Water to make 1 gallon. 
Color light yellow and filter. 

You may make a stronger extract by 
using 15 to 20 oz. each of the oil of Pine- 
apple and tincture of Orris root; in that 
case you have to use 5 pints alcohol to 
the gallon. Use tincture of Orris root in 
the same way with Raspberry and Straw- 
berry. 

Extract of Banana 

6 oz. of Aceate Amyl. 
2oz of Butyrate Amyl. 
16 oz. Glycerine. 

Alcohol, 188 per cent, to make one gal- 
lon. 

Mix and color with Tincture Tumeric, 
4 drahms. 



Banana Extract 

To make banana oil use equal parts of 
amyle acetate and butyric ether. Use 
two ounces glycerine and one drahm 
tincture of tumeric, alcohol to make one 
gallon. Mix thoroughly and filter through 
one-half ounce carbonate magnesia.

of carbonate magnesia. Color yellow 
with tumeric. 



Coloring for Extracts 

Dealers in extract material handle all 
kinds of colors, yellow, green , etc., and 
they are extensively used by manufac- 
turers of extracts, perfumery, etc. They 
take the place of turmeric and other col- 
orings.

1 pt. Alcohol. 

Mix by agitation. 

This is the usual strength as sold in 
shops, but the new Br. Ph. gives it to 
make it very nearly double the strength, 
as follows: With 1 oz. oil use 9 oz. rec- 
tified spirit. 



Lemon Extract 

(Soluble.) 

5 oz. Oil of Lemon. 

2 pts. Alcohol, 188 per cent. 

6 pts. Water. 

2 oz. Carbonate Magnesia. 

Tincture of Tumeric to color. Rub 
the oil and magnesia in mortar, pour in 
alcohol slowly and set aside for two days 
and then add the water, a little at a time 
and shake well and let stand for a week 
or ten days and then filter and add color. 
You can make Orange soluble in same 
way but make color darker by using 
small amount of Caramel, (burnt sugar.) 
The cheap extracts of cloves, pepper- 
mint, cinnamon, etc., are made as given 
in formulae for lemon extract, soluble. 



Soluble Lemon 

1 oz. Oil Lemon. 

10 oz. Alcohol, 188 per cent. 

9 oz. Water. 

Magnesia, q. s. 

Combine oil and alcohol and let stand 
48 hours and add magnesia. Heat water 
100 degrees (not over) turn very slowly 
into the first mixture, stirring well, filter. 



FRUIT JUICES 



I GIVE instructions by which all con- 
fectioners may extract and preserve 
their own fruit essences, and so 
guard their health and add to the pleas- 
ure of all for whom they provide. 
Among the juicy fruits are strawber- 
ries, raspberries, blackberrries, cherries 



and currants. Among non-juicy fruits 
are apples, pears, peaches, quinces, apri- 
cots and plums. 

Mash the juicy fruits in a basin to a 
pulp. Place on the fire and make scald- 
ing hot. Now pour into a hair sieve and 
allow the juice to strain through. Put 
into bottles and securely tie down. Place 
the bottles in a caldron of cold water and 
boil for twenty minutes. Remove from 
the fire and allow to remain in the cal- 
dron until cold. Then set away for use. 

In the case of non-juicy fruits, such 
as apples, pears, peaches, etc., put the 
fruit into a basin, cover with water and 
boil to a pulp. Now place on hair sieve 
and allow to drain without any pressing. 
Observe now that it is only the liquor 
which passes through the sieve without 
pressing which is to be used for flavor- 
ing purposes. What remains in the form 
of pulp is not adapted for these uses. 
Now put the juice as obtained as above 
into bottles and proceed to treat as al- 
ready laid down for the juicy fruits. The 
foregoing processes are to be gone 
through with in the case where extracts 
are to be kept transparent and clear, 
as for syrups, cordials and beverages. 

In case where the flavorings are to be 
used for any purpose where transpar- 
ency or clearness is desirable, such as 
for ice creams, fruit ices or bonbons, then 
I would use not' only the clear fluid, but 
the pulp of the fruit also. I would for 
these opaque purposes save and utilize 
everything of the fruit except the skins 
and seeds. This pulp is to be treated as 
already laid down. 

As thus obtained and preserved our 
confectioners can supply themselves 
with a quantity of perfectly pure ex- 
tracts of all their favorite fruits, and 
which can always be at hand, for flavor- 
ing every description of pastry, cakes, 
pies, tarts, puddings, creams, ices and 
beverages at any season of the year. Es- 
pecially when there is any one in the 
house who is sick or feverish, cordials 
may be flavored with these delightful

FORMULAS 



For Preparing Ciders, Butters, 
Jellies, Mustards, Catsup, Etc. 

Formula for Preparing Condensed 
Cider 

1 gallon of Compound Cider acid. 
% pint of coloring solution. 

2 pints of double concentrated cider. 
2 pints of Garantose. 

2 quarts of solution of Benzoate of 
soda. 

2 or 3 gallons of boiled cider, added to

Simply mix by adding forty-eight gal- 
lons of water, and in adding the water, 
see that it is thoroughly mixed, and you 
will have one of the best ciders on the 
market. Or you can sell the cider in 
concentrated form, when shipping it a 
long distance. Or preparing it for home 
trade as artificial cider, simply add water. 

Whiskey kegs or barrels are the best 
packages for shipment or storing this 
cider. If you use new packages, be sure 
and have them paraflned.

and place it into a one gallon glass bot- 
tle and partly fill with warm water, and 
shake it up until all is dissolved, then 
fill the bottle with water and again 
thoroughly shake. Always shake the 
bottle before using and keep it well 
corked. 

Use the following prepared colorings 
for different kind of Ciders. 



Caramel or Sugar Coloring For Apple 
Cider 

Orange coloring for Orange Cider. 

Cherry coloring for Cherry Cider. 

Caramel or Currant for Blackberry 
Cider. 

Currant coloring for Grape Cider. 

These colorings are the cheapest, best 
and purest. Be certain to prepare them 
as instructed and use according to form- 
ula. (For any of the above ingredients 
entering into the formulas write for 
prices to Kelso & Co., Manufacturers and

111. They are responsible). 

Should you desire to have a heavy 
body to the artificial ciders use the fol- 
lowing: Simply add 3 or 4 gallons of 
Gum Tragacanth. 



Directions For Preparing Gum^Trag- 
acanth 

Take five pounds of Gum-Tragacanth 
and put it in a 45 gallon barrel and fill 
up with warm water, stirring same 3 or 
4 times daily until all is dissolved — it may 
take a week or ten days to thoroughly 
dissolve, and when it is all dissolved add 
one (1) pound of Benzoate of Soda 
thoroughly dissolved in one gallon of hot 
water. 



Directions for Preparing Sugar Col- 
oring 

Disolve one (1) pound of dry coloring 
in two (2) gallons of hot water, thor- 
oughly stirring; be sure that it is thor- 
oughly dissolved, then let same boil for 
about a minute or less, when it is ready 
for use. (Kelso & Co. Importers, 209, 
211 S. Clinton, Chicago, Illinois, will 
supply you with all colors.) 



Formula for Peach Butter 

Use peaches unfit for preserving, re- 
moving the stones, to those you may add 
the peelings of good peaches; add enough 
water to boil; and boil to a fine pulp, 
then run through a pulper with No. 1 
seive — to each 100 lbs. of pulp add 25 lbs. 
of yellow sugar and ^ oz. extract of 
peach, then boil a little over four hours. 
Then add for each 100 lbs. 4 oz. of Ben- 
zoate of Soda, dissolve well with hot but- 
ter and added, then let boil once more. 
Pill in pails or jars, but do not cover un- 
til quite cool — stir well while boiling. 



burning. When well cooked run through 
pulper, using No. 3 sieve. To each 100 
pounds of pulp, add twenty -five pounds 
yellow sugar, J^ oz. of finely powdered 
cloves, and % oz. aniline coloring, then 
bcil for six hours. Add three ounces of 
benzoate of soda for each 100 pounds, 
dissolved in hot pulp and add to the 
rest. Stir well while boiling. 



Formula for Plum Butter 

Use plums unfit for preserving — boil 
well with sufficient water to prevent 



Formula for Apple Butter 

Slice apples, add sufficient water to pre- 
vent burning, and increase water until all 
are cooked, to a fine pulp; take clean cloth 
and strain off all the juice, then replace 
pulp in kettle, and to every 100 pounds 
of pulp, add 20 lbs. of brown sugar and 
one (1) ounce finely powdered Saigon 
Cassia. Boil for 7 or 8 hours then put 
in jars, and add for each 100 pounds 
two (2) ounces of Benzoate of Soda, 
thoroughly dissolved in hot water, then 
put into kettle and boil once more, then 
fill into pails, kegs or barrels. 

Boil (with stirrer) from 8 to 10 hours 
with kettle covered, steam will escape 
through the opening for stirrer. When 
butter is finished run it through the 
pulp machine. Properly cooked apple 
butter will keep without any preser- 
vative. 

Formula for Quince Butter 

Cut in slices and boil with plenty of 
water to a fine pulp, run through pulper 
then replace in kettle and for every 100 
pounds of pulp add 25 lbs. of yellow 
sugar and boil for six hours slowly, add 
after dissolving in hot water, % ounce 
extract of Quince to each 100 pounds and 
4 ounces of Benzoate of Soda. If packed 
in pails, put a sheet of wax paper over 
each. 

If butter is made in large quantities, 
store in empty glucose barrels in cool 
cellar. When kept in pails for a long 
time use solution of Benzoate of Soda. 
Spread very lightly over the top. 

To prevent leakage, parafine the pails, 



22 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



but in that case put the butter in after 
cooling. 

For naking Cheap Jelly 

Take two barrels of apple waste, put 
in tank with water sufficient to boil with 
open steam. When cooked to a pulp, 
run through a press while hot, and ex- 
tract all the juice possible, then boil 
juice down to 16 per cent syrup scale, 
and add as much glucose as juice, color 
to suit, with aniline, and flavor to suit 
with extract — then boil once more. 

Dissolve 5 pounds Citric acid, and 5 
pounds Tartaric acid in 5 gallons of hot 
water, mix well, then put the mixed acid 
in the bottom of each pail, in the follow- 
ing quantities. 

For a 30 lb. pail 4 oz. 

For a 20 lb. pail 3 oz. 

For a 10 lb. pail 2 oz. 

For a 5 lb. pail 1 oz. 

Run hot jelly into pails and skim off 
the foam, before it gets cool. Jelly will 
harden in a very short time. 



Formula for Jelly from Apple Juice 

Boil 50 gallons of juice down to 18 per 
cent syrup scale, then add 80 lbs. of 
glucose, 20 lbs, of white sugar, and 8 oz. 
of jelly acid. If you make strawberry 
add 2 ounces of extract of strawberry 
and one ounce of aniline coloring, watch 
closely when boiling, and when jelly be- 
gins to string off the perforation, shut 
off steam — add flavoring and acid when 
jelly is nearly done. 

The acid is made by dissolving 10 lbs. 
of Tartaric acid and 10 lbs. of Citric acid 
in four gallons of boiling water. 

The aniline is made by dissolving J^ 
lb. of aniline in one quart of alcohol — 
when dark color is wanted, add more 
coloring. For blackberry jelly, use a 
few ounces of sugar coloring. For apple 
and pear jelly use no coloring; for pine- 
apple, quinces, and peach use no color- 
ing. Use the different flavors for differ- 
ent jellies. When packing jelly put wax 



paper on top, and if kept long time, add 
a very light layer of preserving solution. 
Never leave apple juice over night, it will 
sour. 

Formula for Preserves 

100 pounds preserved fruits (see for- 
mula.) 

12 gals, of Juice. 

60 lbs. Glucose. 

40 lbs. of Granulated White Sugar. 

Place the above in kettle and boil, use 
perforation, keeping it stirring all the 
time — after cooking for 30 to 45 minutes, 
add 8 ounces of jelly acid, stir in well 
and shut off steam. Fill into pails or 
glasses while hot. After standing for a 
time, and before it hardens, stir it, as 
fruit will sick to the bottom. If you 
want highly flavored goods, add 4 ounces 
of extract of the fruit you preserve. 



Formula for Producing a fine L)rink = 
ing Cider from Boiled Cider 

30 gals, of Soft Water. 

25 lbs. of Granulated Sugar. 

%lbs. Tartaric Acid. 

2 gals. Heavy Boiled Cider. 

Dissolve the sugar in the water, then 
add the boiled cider and acid — agitate 
well, and after coloring to suit your 
taste, allow the mixture to settle for 10 
or 20 hours, and then draw off the clear 
liquid from the sediment in clean casks, 
at a temperature of 80 or 85 it will re- 
quire 3 or 4 days to produce effervesence 
— then add preservative (say 1 ounce of 
Benzoate of Soda, to each 10 gallons of 
finished goods) and it is fit for immediate 
use — keep it in a cool place. 

The writer, of this formula, has made 
hundreds of barrels, in this way. when 
cider was scarce and it cannot be told 
generally from the pure juice. 



Formula for Preserving Fruit for Pre= 

serves 

For every 100 pounds of selected clean 
fruit, such as Raspberries, Strawberries, 
Huckleberries, Gooseberries, or Black- 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



23 



berries add .30 pounds of granulated su- 
gar: boil in a copper kettle for a few 
minutes, if not enough natural juice, add 
from two to four gallons of apple juice — 
then add for each 100 pounds of fruit 
with sugar, three (3) ounces of Salicylic 
acid, well mixed with hot juice before 
adding. 

Pack away in 15 to 30 gallon kegs 
(new) and store in cool cellar until need- 
ed for preserves. Mark kegs thus: 

100 pounds strawberry, 3 ounces, xxx 
—1816197. 
Or 

200 pounds of strawberry 6 ounces xxx 
—1816197. 

In case of peaches and quinces, after 
cleaning and stoning peaches, cut in 
slices, then cover well with water and 
boil until soft, but not too soft. Quinces 
take longer to boil than peaches as they 
require more water. Weigh fruit before 
putting in the kettle, and for every 100 
pounds add 30 pounds granulated sugar 
and three (3) ounces of Salicylic acid. 
Treat apples and pears in the same man- 
ner. 

In the case of plums and cherries, if 
not enough natural juice, add apple 
juice sufficient to cover — boil' till soft, 
then run through pulper No. 3 sieve, 
then replace in kettle, add sugar and 
Salicylic acid as before. 

For grapes use finer seive, say No. 12, 
and treat same as plums and cherries.

flour and cold water enough to make a 
thin batter, and mix well, then pour al- 
together and boil until it gets thick 
as you want it. Add cinnamon or all- 
spice to suit taste. This will make a 
splendid apple butter at a cost of about 
2 cents per pound, it will be pure as far 
as any chemicals are concerned. Make 
small lots until you get it to suit your 
taste, and then make larger quantity.

Hop Ale 

Of the best quality is made direct from 
hops exactly in the same manner as 
ordinary bitter ale, with a malt and 
sugar rnort adjusted so that the fer- 
mented liquor may not contain more 
than the non-excisable percentage of 
proof spirit. Considerable skill is re- 
quired in making this beer. Thequanity 
of hop used is 1 pound to 12 gallons of 
boiling water. After standing for three 
hours in covered vessel the infusion is 
strained through a twill bag, and in it are 
dissolved 7 pounds of sugar and 1 pound 
of malt extract, then being made up to 
12 gallons with water and when the 
temperature reaches 70 degrees F., 1 
ounce compressed yeast is added. Fer- 
ment eight hours, strain, add 1 ounce of 
bisulphate of lime solution and a hand- 
ful of isinglass findings; then rack for 
three days and bottle. Another formula 
is. 

5 lbs of Demeraga Sugar.

Marmalade 

(From Skuse's Art of Confectionery) 

Have every ingredient of prime qual- 
ity and utensils scrupulously clean. Use 
sound heavy Seville or Malaga oranges. 
There is a fine quality of almost trans- 
parent marmalade now in the market, 
known as homemade. Almost innocent 
of chips, consequently not so bitter and 
a great favorite with the children. This 
sort is largely made up of orange pulp 
known in the trade as "Dummies." 

Within the last few years, the rinds 
only of the orange is used by some firms 
for making essential oils. The pulpy 
portion is sold at a low price to marma- 
lade makers. 

To PREPARE THE CHIP AND PULP: Put 

any quantity of oranges into a tub, cover 
them with boiling water and let them 
soak for a few minutes, then pick them 
up, one at a time, and mark the rind 
with a knife into four quarters; now 
separate the pulp from the rind, pack 
the rind cup shape into boxes of the 
machine, and cut them into slices. When 
cold, sort them over; take out those 
imperfectly cut and put them through 
the machine again; if well packed in the 
machine box in the first instance, there 
will be but few that require recutting. 
Now take the slices, fill the steam tub, 
turn on the steam and let them cook 
until tender; try them between the 
fingers and thumb; when you can nip 



them off short, they are done, or they 
may be boiled in a steam pan by cover- 
ing them with water, the steam turned 
on, and allow to cook for nearly two and 
a half hours; when ready, take them out 
and strain through a wicker sieve. 

To prepare the jmlp, put anv quantity 
into a steam pan, cover them with water, 
turn on the steam and stir with a long 
flat stick until reduced to a mass of 
pulp, now take them out and rub them 
through a cone sieve, just large enough 
to keep back the pips, or put them 
through a pulping machine with copper 
sieve, eight holes to the inch. Dummies 
are treated, of course, same as pulp. 



Sup. Orange Harmalade 

40 lbs. Orange Pulp strained. 

10 lbs. Orange Chips. 

60 lbs. Dutch Crushed Sugar. 

1 gal. Best Apple Juice. 

Process: Pass half of the pulp while 
hot through a coarse hair sieve; mix all 
the ingredients together in a pan and 
boil off in the ordinary way. The 
oranges for home made article should be 
specially heavy, with a thinnish skin. N. 
B. — When there is a super-abundance of 
chips and no dummies to be had, work 
up the surplus chips in cheaper qualities, 
using apple juice and glucose. When 
preserving the orange pulp for future 
use, mix the pulp and chips together in 
the proportion for boiling.

Tea Tasting 

The following hints on tasting have 
been abridged from the "Tea Planters' 
Vode Mecum" and "Rutherford's Note 
Book." In tasting tea the tea-maker 
should look to the four following char- 
acteristics: (1) Its nose or smell; (2nd) 
Its liquor; (3rd) Its infusion; (4th) Its 
leaf. 

1st. Its nose, whether strong, rich 
scent, minty, nutty, musty, burnt, high 
fired, or brisk, judged by smell. 

2nd. Its liquor, whether strong, rasp- 
ing, pungent, brisk, flavory, full, thick, 
nutty, dark, or wanting in strength, dull, 
insipid, thin, burnt, over-fired, soft; 
judged by taste. 

3rd. Its infusion bright or dark col- 
ored, or mixed with green, or any dark 
or burnt leaves, amount of stalk, and 
whether over or under fermented; judged 
by sight. 

4th. Leaf. Its make and appearance, 
whether black, wiry, even, regular, well, 
little or open twisted, hard or light 
rolled, flaky, bold, tippy, grey, dusty or 
irregular, wanting in tips, etc; judged by 
sight. 



Chewing Gum 

2 lbs. Prepared Balsam of Tolu. 

3 lbs. Pine Powdered Oatmeal.

then add the sugar with which you have 
mixed the oil, stir and gradually add the 
oatmeal. Work up with hands, when 
well mixed, keeping them rubbed in fine 
powdered sugar. Then roll out flat and 
cut in sticks or cakes the size wanted. 



Prepared Balsam of Tolu 

1 lb. Genuine Balsam of Tolu. 

4 lbs. White Resin (crushed). 

6 ozs. Mutton Suet.

tute any other flavoring for the Winter- 
green. 



Grease Remover 

1 pint Benzine. 

2 ozs. Pure Alcohol. 

2 ozs. Sulphuric Ether. 
\% drams Essence of Lemon. 

This is a great seller and the profits 
are large. A one ounce bottle of this 
sells for ten cents. The direction is to 
sponge over the grease marks with a 
piece of clean flannel wet with the 
remover. 



Artificial Honey 

The best is: 

10 lbs. Brown Sugar. 

4 pints Water. 

45 grs. Cream of Tartar. 

10 drops Essence of Peppermint. 

3 lbs. Bee's Honey. 

Dissolve the sugar in the water over a 
slow fire and take off the scum. Then 
dissolve the cream of tartar in half a cup 
of hot water and add; stir well, warm 
the honey and add that; stir again until 
well mixed, then take off the fire, add 
the peppermint and stir until cold. 

The formula without bee's honey is 
this: 

4 lbs. Brown Sugar. 
1 pint Water. 

Bring them to a boil and take off the 
scum; then add powdered alum, one- 
fourth ounce, and cream of tartar, one- 
half ounce, dissolved in half cup of hot 
water. Stir well until thoroughly mixed; 
take off the fire and stir in fifteen drops 
of essence of honeysuckle flowers. Stir 
well until cold.

The direction is to use one teaspoonful 
to each pint of starch. Put in 3 ounce 
bottles to retail at 10 cents. This shows 
a large profit and as it has merit there is 
a constant demand for it after once used. 



Sand Balls 

Cut up two pounds of yellow soap in 
thin slices and melt in a kettle with six 
ounces water. When melted stir in 1 lb. 
finely sifted and washed sand, the clear 
white silver sand or sea shore sand be- 
ing the best. Mix up well and pour into 
a tray, continuing stirring as it begins to 
set. Before it sets hard mould it with 
the hands into balls or ovals about the 
size of a hen's egg and set aside for a day 
or two to dry. 

These balls are very durable, especially 
if you arrange to dr}' them a month or 
two before selling, and in many manu- 
facturing and iron working districts sell 
largely.

Oak Varnish 

3% lbs. Crushed Clear Rosin, 
1 Gallon Turpentine. 

Dissolve by gentle heat. Great care 
must be taken in making this or the 
turpentine will catch fire very easily. If 
you like you can put them in a demijohn, 
cork well, and by shaking for a few days 
avoid using heat. Unless you are used 
to handling turpentine over a fire this 
will be the safer way. 

A three ounce bottle retails for fifteen 
cents and the directions is to apply it to 
the furniture to be brightened up with a 
soft brush. I think it would be best to 
put up bottle and small brush so as to 
retail for twenty -five cents. 



Black Stain for Leather 

3 ozs. Extract of Logwood. 

3 4 oz. Ivory Black. 

i.. oz. Glycerine. 

i'2 grains Bichromote of Potash. 

12 grains Copperas. 

% gal. Water. 

Boil all together. As well as being 
efficient this is also cheap and can be 
put in 3 oz. bottles to retail for fifteen 
cents. It is largely used for turning 
shoes black, 

Directions: Apply with a sponge or 
soft brush, giving a second coat if neces- 
sary. 

This will be good. 



Furniture Oil 

2 oz. Acetic Acid. 

y 2 oz. Cheap Oil of Lavender. 

1 oz. Cheap Wood Alcohol. 

Mix and shake well together. 

Rub on the furniture with a small pad 
of woolen cloth and polish with a piece 
of Canton flannel. This will make a 
good seller. 

To Keep Cider from Souring 

When the cider has reached the flavor 
desired, add one or two tumblersful of 
grated horseradish (according to size 
of barrel) to each barrel and stir it a 
little so as to mix with the cider. 



Liquid Bluing 

1 oz. Prussian Blue. 

% oz. Oxalic Acid. 

1 qt. Warm Water. 

This is to be put up in small bottles 
to retail for 5 or 10 cents. Directions: 
A few drops to be added to the water in 
which the clothes are rinsed until the 
desired shade is obtained. 



Razor Paste 

Butter powder, Jeweler's rogue, finest 
emery powder, beef suet, of each 1 ounce. 

Mix the powder first, then melt the 
suet and mix all together.

Have all in fine powder and mix thor- 
oughly; wrap in waxed paper % ounce 
packets which sell for 5 cents in some 
places and 10 cents in others. The % 
ounce is to be dissolved in % pint of 
boiling water. There is a good profit in 
this. 

Laundry Tablets 

This is a good seller and will sell 
rapidly when introduced and pay a big 
profit. It is a repeater. 

Melt 6 pounds of white paraffine. In 
a quart of warm water dissolve 6 ounces 
of powdered borax and when dissolved 
pour into the melted wax and stir well. 
When mixed pour into a large pan to 
cool and set. You now have a big cake 
borated wax with the water you used 
left at the bottom. Throw away the 
water and again melt up the wax and as 
soon as melted pour into a shallow tray 
to set. Pour about }4 inch deep. When 
cold cut into square tablets of about x / 2 
inch each. One of these is to be dis- 
solved in the water to work the dirty 
clothes. It saves rubbing, saves time 
and saves wear on the clothes. The best 
way is to wrap two tablets in a circular 
advertising them, and sell for 5 cents.

Cheap Vanilla Extract 

This paragraph refers to the cheap 
Vanilla at 30 cents per gallon on another 
page. Use musk baur. Civetal is another 
kind of musk and it is better to make 
cheap vanilla. Some manufacturers use 
a little genuine musk in making a fine 
vanilla. 



Flour— How to Select 

The Scientific Encyclopedia says: Look 
at its color. If it is white with a slightly 
yellowish straw color tint, it is a good 
sign. If it is very white with a bluish 
cast, or with black specks in it, the flour 
is not good. 2nd. — Examine its ad- 
hesiveness — wet and knead a little of it 
between the fingers; if it works dry and 
elastic, it is good; if it works soft and 
sticky it is poor. Flour made from spring 
wheat is likely to be sticky. 3rd— Throw 
a little lump of dry flour against a dry 
smooth, perpendicular surface; if it ad- 
heres in a lump, the flour has life in it, 
if it falls like powder it is bad. 4th. — 
Squeeze some of the flour in your hand; 
if it retains the shape given by the 
pressure, that too, is a good sign. Flour 
that will stand all of these tests is safe 
to buy. 

Flour, Self Rising: The following 
•are the composition of several of these 
powders in extensive use: (1) — Bicarbo- 
nate Soda, 23 ozs; burnt alum, 19 ozs;

Cement for Attaching Labels to Tin 

Much difficulty is experienced by many 
people in attaching labels to tin boxes. 
We give the following. On another page 
we give another formula. You may take 
your choice. 

Gum Tragacanth 10 parts 

Honey 10 parts

Flavoring Powders 

A good many people would rather use 
a powder extract in preference to a liquid, 
believing the powders contain no alcohol. 

Oil of Lemon 1 oz. 

Alcohol 1 oz. 

Powdered Sugar 2 lbs. 

Put the oil and alcohol in a bottle, and 
shake thoroughly; place the sugar in a 
dish, and add the liquid slowly and stir 
constantly. When thoroughly mixed, 
set away to dry. When thoroughly dry 
it should be pulverized aeain, and packed 
in air tight boxes or cans holding 2 ozs. 
This is a good seller. Proceed the same 
with oil of Orange, Cloves, Cinnamon or 
other oils or extracts. 

Directions for using Pou'ders — Use 
from one-fourth to one-half teaspoonful 
to the quart of mixture, varying more or 
less to suit the taste. Can be used in 
dry state or dissolved in water. Retail 
price ten cent an ounce, or three ounces

Ambergris; 7, natural musk from the 
musk ox; 8, artificial musk; 9, civet; 10

KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



civetol; 11, artificial essential oils; 12, 
products of the new chemistry. 

The finest handkerchief extracts made 
by the old world-renowned manufactur- 
ers are made from the pomade washings 
combined with natural musk, ambergris, 
essential oils and aromatic gums. 

The concrete flower essence are sub- 
stitutes for the pomade washings, but 
not in my opinion equal to them. The 
artificial essential oils are for the most 
part inferior to the natural. The cheap 
perfumes with which the market is 
flooded are products of the new chem- 
istry. 

The pomades from which the pomade 
washings are made are regular articles 
of commerce and are sold by all dealers 
in perfume supplies. The pomades are 
imported mostly from Prance and Ger- 
many. The washings may be bought, 
but it is more economical to buy your 
pomades and wash them yourself. 



grease is then run into cans and exported 
for the use of perfumes. There are 
other methods, some new, but none in 
my opinion which give so good results as 
the one above described. 



Pomades 

The pomades used by perfumers are 
made mostly in France. They are put 
up in tin cans of 2% and 5 kilogrammes 
each. It is often hard to get the smaller 
cans, the large ones being generally kept 
in stock by dealers. I cannot quote the 
price at the present writing, but rose, 
jasmine, orange, tube rose, etc., are 
worth from $1.50 to §2.00 per pound, per- 
haps some $2.25 per pound and violet is 
worth $2.50 to $2.75 per pound, according 
to the number of enfleuroges, or in other 
words according to the strength of the 
pomades. 

Enfleuroges 

Cotton batting is saturated with 
grease and spread on trays in a room 
kept at proper temperature. The 
greased cotton is covered with say rose 
leaves, after a few days the rose leaves 
are faded and scentless, the oder having 
been absorbed by the grease. The ex- 
hausted leaves are then removed and 
replaced by fresh ones until the grease 
is fully saturated with the oder. The 



Washing Pomades 

Take a vessel with wide opening in the 
top, a milk can does very well, put into 
it say 4 gallons alcohol. If the can con- 
taining the alcohol is set into a wash tub 
with a little ice and salt around it so as 
to chill the alcohol a better result will be 
secured than if the alcohol is at an ordi- 
nary temperature. Melt the pomade 
with very gentle heat — this can be done 
by setting can into warm water. Then 
carry the melted grease to a considerable 
hight. If you are in a two story building 
you may bore a hole in the upper floor 
to put funnel through and set can with 
cold alcohol on floor below. Then the 
melted pomade which should be about 
the consistency of molasses is poured 
into alcohol from the floor above. This 
is the principle of the shot tower. In its 
passage down, the pomade is formed into 
globules and, hardened by the cold alco- 
hol, they are prevented from cohering in 
a mass. The pomade in alcohol may 
then be kept at ordinary temperature 
for about six weeks, stirred gently every 
few days after which the alcohol is poured 
or rather strained or filtered. The alco- 
hol now contains the flower odor and is 
known to perfumers as pomade wash- 
ings. The grease may be treated by 
pouring on fresh alcohol enough to cover 
it, stirred occasionally for 2 or 3 weeks — 
this gives what is called second washing. 
The grease so exhausted is sold to soap 
makers. But the pomade washings are 
not yet finished, the r^eohol takes up a 
certain amount of the grease and if this 
were not chilled out ic would ruin your 
handkerchief. 

Extracts: Winter is the best time 
to chill pomade washings. They 
may be set out doors ov r night in the 
coldest weather and filtered in n very 
cold place. This tuk s uuL the groase

To make the tincture or washings 
from concrete essence, take one ounce 
of the latter, warm it by placing the con- 
tainer in warm water, then pour it into 
1 gallon of warm colonge spirits. Do 
not warm the concrete essence nor the 
colonge spirits to more than one hundred 
Shake well and you have a gallon of fine 
washings or tincture. To make tincture 



of vanilla for perfumery purposes, use 4 
ounces of vanillin to 1 gallon of colonge 
spirits. 

To make other tinctures would refer 
you to Grffith's Formula book. I would 
advise all to procure a copy of this book, 
as it is valuable — price $5.00. Remit to 
Sioux Publishing Co., Sutherland, Iowa. 

The cost to make the above perfumes 
(not the concentrate) will be about $4.50 
to $5.00 per gallon and it is claimed will 
produce a very fine perfume.

BAKING POWDERS 



There are several kinds of Baking 
Powder on the market and it is only a 
question of what price you care to make 
it. I will give you a number of formulas 
so you may take your choice. 



No. 1 



Equal in purity and strength to any 
Baking Powder on the market: 



46 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



Pure Grape Cream of Tartar 3 lbs. 

Soda Bicorbonate (baking soda)..lJ^ lbs. 

Corn Starch 1% lbs. 

Tartaric Acid 1 oz. 

Powdered Carbonate Ammonia. 2 drams. 
Use two teaspoonf uls to one quart flour. 



Formula No. i 

This powder is equal to some of the 

highest priced baking powders in the 

market. Costs about 10c per pound. 

Pure Grape Cream of Tartar 1% lbs. 

Soda Bicarbonate 1 lb. 

Corn Starch 2 lbs. 

Tartaric Acid 3 ozs. 

Squibbs Powdered Carbonate Am- 
monia 1 dram. 

Use two teaspoonsful to one quart of 

flour. 



Farmula No. 3 

This is a very fine cheap baking pow- 
der. Costs about 7c per pound: 

Pure Grape Cream of Tartar % lb. 

Cream of Tartar Substitute 1 lb. 

Soda Bicorbonate 1% lbs. 

Acid Phosphate of Lime lib. 

Corn Starch 2% lbs. 

Use two teaspoonfuls to one quart of 
flour. 



Formula No. 4 

A very good baking powder, especially 
when you desire to make one at a cheap 
price. Costs about 3 cents per pound. 

Cream of Tartar Substitute 1J< lbs. 

Soda Bircarbonate 1% l bs - 

Acid Phosphate of Lime l}£ lbs* 

Corn Starch 3 lbs. 

Mix thoroughly. Use two teaspoons- 
ful to one quart flour. All above formu- 
las must be mixed thoroughly and dry. 
Cream of tartar has about 15 per cent 
moisture, it should not contain over 5 to 
7 per cent moisture or the baking pow- 
der will bake. 



Formula No. 5 

A cheap baking powder without alum. 

Acid Sulphate of Potash 6 ozs. 

Soda Bicarbonate 8 ozs. 

Corn Starch 16 ozs. 

Mix well. 



Formula No. 6 
A tine cream tartar baking powder, 
costs about 10 to 12 cents per pound. 

Cream of Tartar 2)4 lbs. 

Bicarb, of Soda lib. 

Starch \% lb. 

Mix thoroughly. 



Formula No. 7 

The following is a formula for alum 
baking powder. 

25 lbs. C. I. S. (burnt alum pwd.) 

25 lbs. B. C. S. Bicarb, soda granulated. 

50 lbs. Powdered Starch. 

1 to 2 ozs. Egg Albumen. 

To make a 14 per cent Alum and 
Phosphate powder. 

Take 

100 lbs. C. I. S. (burnt alum.) 

02''.; lbs. Phosphate, granulated is best 
but is more expensive — besides the Rum- 
ford people claim this is their process — 
the other does very well. 

II6I4 lbs. B. C. Soda. 
136)1 lbs. Starch (filler). 
1 lb. Egg Albumen. 

This will make a powder very strong — 
you might add starch enough to make 
500 lbs. and then have a good powder 
equal to — - make. 

The Rumford people are making a 
phosphate powder which is giving very 
good satisfaction, but they are bringing 
suit against other manufacturers who 
are imitating their product. The great 
trouble with a phosphate baking powder 
is that it will not keep. By using a 
granulated, that is to say coarsejy pow- 
dered phosphate and also a granulated 
soda the difficulty is in some measure 
overcome; but the Rumford people 
claim that this" is their method and that 
any one using it infringes on them, etc. 
The writer does not know the outcome 
of it. 



Egg Powder 

Egg albumen, that is the whites of 
eggs, is imported in large quantities 
mostly from Russia and powdered in 
this country- It is a regular article of 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



47 



commerce. Powdered egg albumen may 
be bought from A. Klipstein & Co., 122 
Pearl St., New York, or from any dealer in 
this line. It costs 75 to 80 cents per 
pound in 5 and 10 pound lots — the price 
fluctuates. 

It may be put into any kind of baking 
powder, and I think when the article is 
good and fresh and dry, etc., it is some 
improvement to any baking powder it is 
put into. It is mostly used in the cheaper 
powders and causes them to show to much 
better advantage than they otherwise 
would in what is called the gloss test. 
One ounce to 100 pounds will make quite 
a difference. I think it may be better to 
use 2 or 3 ounces to 100 pounds — some 
use a good deal more than that but it is 
quite unnecessary. Do not go more than 
4 ounces to 100 pounds at most. Try 1 
or 2 ounces to 100 pounds. 



The following baking powder formulas 
are taken from Griffith's Non-Secret 
Formulas. By all means you should 
have this book and an order will be filled 
by the Sioux Publishing Co., Suther- 
land, Iowa. Price, S5.00 per copy. The 
book contains 513 large pages, elegantly 
bound and contains a great deal of good 
information. The writer cannot recom- 
mend the book too highly. 



General Directions for Mixing Baking 
Powder 

The ingredients should be sifted sepa- 
rately into a mixing trough; sift the 
starch or flour first; then the acid, mix 
well and then sift the soda, mix well 
again, using preferably a fiat wooden 
paddle. Then put the powders into a 
mixing machine; or sift them well at least 
three times so as to ensure thorough 
mixing; be careful to have all your mate- 
rials quite dry; moisture is detrimental 
to the keeping proprieties of all baking 
powders, especially those made with tar- 
taric acid or cream of tartar. The starch 
in baking powders tends to preserve the 
quality unimpaired by preventing the 
acids from attacking the soda.

It wholesales for two dollars per dozen 
and retails at twenty- five cents per can 
and as you see will leave a very good 
margin to the manufacturer. 



Baking Powder 

We give below the analysis of a num- 
ber of baking powders which are now on 
the market, they are first class sellers, 
and will give good satisfaction. Al- 
though about every jobber and retailer 
in the U. S. are handling these goods, 
we prefer not to mention the manufac- 
turers name. An analysis of article No. 
1 contained; 

Phosphate 7 . 73 

Sodium Aluminum (burnt alum). 21.73 

Bicarb. Soda 24.81 

Starch 45.73 

100.00 
Sample marked No. 2 proved to be the 
following: 

Phosphate 8 . 15 

Ammonium Aluminum Sulphate 

(burnt alum) 20 . 16 

Soda Bicarbonate 18 .35 

Starch (commercial) 53 . 34 

100.00 
The above two samples are about the 
same in cost and effect, though they sell 
by the manufacturer at over $1.00 per 
dozen difference in the price. Some 
states have no food law and it would not 
be necessary to pay any attention to the 
label, but in those states where the food 
law is in effect, you may be compelled to 
label "This can of Powder Contains 
Alum." You may obtain a copy of the 
food law of any state by applying to the 
State Food Commissioner. 

Sample of article No. 3 turned out to 
be what is called an "alum phosphate 
baking powder;" not much difference in 
the three formulas, but you will notice 
the posphate has been reduced. The 
manufacturer who sold this put it out 
under the name of "Leader," and retail- 
ing at 10 cents per can and at 75 cents 
per dozen wholesale. 

Phosphate 6 . 90 

Sodium Aluminum Sulphate 
(burntalum) 19.87 



Bicarbonate of Soda 24 .73 

Starch 43.50 

100.00 

This formula at 75 cents per dozen is 

nearly as good powder as the one selling 

at $2.00 per dozen as given in formula 

No. 2. 

Sample No. 4 is as follows: 

Phosphate 2G.03 

Sodium Aluminum Sulphate 

(burnt alum) , 26.24 

Bicarbonate of Soda 22 . 55 

Starch 25. IS 

100.00 

You will notice the phosphate has been 
increased to 26 per cent in the above 
This powder retails at 25 cents per can. 

Sample No. 5 is as follows: 

Burnt Alum (Sodium Aluminum 

Sulphate) 21.99 

Phosphate 12.06 

Albumen 0.07 

Sodium Bicarbonate 26.55 

Starch 39.33 

Jobs at 82.00 per dozen and retails at 
25 cents per can. The firm who manu- 
factures this article put out more baking 
powder than any firm in the U. S. out- 
side of the baking powder trust. 

Albumen is a commercial product and 
may be obtained from any of the supply 
dealers. 

Sample No. 6:

While these formulas run about the 
same in composition, you may wonder 
why we give so many when one or two 
would do. We do this simply to show 
you what other manufacturers are doing 
and what you have got to do to meet 
competition. 



Baking Powder 

Acid phosphate of soda is admirably 
adopted for mixing with the ordinary 
phosphate of lime, as a substitute for 
the granular phosphate of lime, in mak- 
ing baking powder free from alum. It 
is considerably stronger in acid than 
either cream of tartar or acid phosphate 
of lime, the ration being as follows: 100 
lbs. Acid Phosphate of Soda neutralizes 
75 lbs. Bi-Carbonate of Soda; 100 lbs. 
Cream of Tartar neutralizes 45 lbs. of 
Bi-Carbonate Soda; 100 lbs. Acid Phos- 
phate of Lime neutralizes 45 lbs. Bi- 
carbonate of Soda. 

In mixing acid phosphate of soda and 
acid phosphate of lime together the best 
results are obtained in using them in 
about equal quantities. The following 
formulas show approximately the relative 
cost of baking powder manufactured 
from granular phosphate of lime and 
from a mixture of acid phosphate of 
soda and ordinary acid phosphate of lime. 
Each powder tests 13 per cent of Car- 
bonic Acid Gas. 

50 lbs. Granular Acid Phosphate Lime. 
25 lbs. Granular Bi-Carbonate Soda. 
25 lbs. Corn Starch. 

This will cost $5.25 per 100 pounds. 



20 lbs. Acid Phosphate of Soda. 

20 lbs. Acid Phosphate of Lime. 

25 lbs. Granular Bi-Carbonate of Soda. 

35 lbs. Corn Starch. 

Cost per 100 pounds, $5.54. 

In the above formula use granular soda 
in place of fine soda at an extra cost of 
ten cents per hundred. This is not es- 
sential, though it makes a better keep- 
ing powder. Special pains should be 
taken to use acid phosphate of lime that 
does not contain free acid, as free acid 
endangers the keeping qualities. 

To insure best results the starch and 
soda should be kept in a drying room at 
a temperature of about 130 for three or 
four days before mixing. In damp or 
muggy weather it is also desirable that 
the acid phosphate of lime and acid 
phosphate of soda should be kept dry 
while being prepared. Its action is a 
little slower than Cream of Tartar.

Mix well. 

It is not necessary to say anything 
more now regarding baking powder, as 
you may get up any price baking powder 
you may desire. 



Fruit Juice Syrup 

Select fruit should be used and all 
damaged particles removed, as decayed 
matter will spoil the product besides giv- 
ing it a bad flavor. Press the juice out 
of the fresh fruit, strain and add to each 
gallon of juice a half pint of the strong- 
est cologne spirits in which two drams of 
salicylic acid is dissolved, or if cologne 
spirits cannot be easily obtained, a good 
quality of alcohol may be used, set aside 
for twenty four hours to allow the 
pectin to precipitate, decant the clear 
juice and filter the sediment. Into each 
gallon of fruit juice dissolve by bringing 
to a boil 10 pounds of the best granulat- 
ed sugar, set aside and cool, skim and 
bottle. 

If desirable, a small amount of artifi- 
cial flavor may be added, but the pure 



50 



KRAMER'S BOOK OP TRADE SECRETS 



fruit should give better satisfaction, a 
small quantity of citric acid or tartaric 
acid may be added to accentuate the 
flavor. 

In boiling fruit juice, well enameled 
whiteware or clean copper kettles should 
be used. 



Soda Fountain Syrups 

There is good money in making soda 
fountain syrups and they are very easy 
made. A good strong A No. 1 vanilla 
syrup can be made as low as 25 cents 
per gallon and will give the best satis- 
faction. 

To Make Simple Syrup 

To make syrup, pour % gallon boiling 
water on 8 pounds granulated sugar — 
this makes 1 gallon finished syrup, to 
which add glucose in any proportion you 
may see fit. Flavor vanilla syrup with 
2 ounces good vanilla extract (from va- 
nillin; you will not need the coumarin) 
per gallon. Directions are given how to 
prepare a good vanillin extract on an 
another page. Other syrups same way 
except that for orange and lemon you 
should have soluble extracts, which are 
best made from the terpineless oil. 
There are formulas given here so you 
will have no trouble. Flavor other 
syrups same as vanilla, perhaps some not 
quite so much, and then you may use 
gum foam about 1 ounce to 1 gallon. 
For instance: 

Vanilla 

Simple Syrup 1 gal. 

Extract Vanilla 2 ozs 1 

Gum Foam 1 oz. 

Fruit Acid 34 oz - 

Color with caramel. 

Florida Orange 

Simple syrup 1 gal. 

Extract Orange 2 l 4 ozs. 

Fruit acid % oz. 

Gum Foam 1 oz. 

Color slightly with curcuma.

Fruit Acid 1 oz. 

Sarsaparilla 

Simple Syrup 1 gal. 

Extract Sarsaparilla 1 oz. 

Gum Foam 1 oz. 

Caramel to color. 



To Make Simple Syrup 

This makes a fine syrup at a cost of 
30c per gallon. The cost may be reduced 
by adding glucose. 

To make simple syrup use G lbs. granu- 
lated sugar and enough filtered water to 
make a gallon, and make by the cold 
process and strain through cheese cloth. 
It will require about 3 pints of water to 
the gallon.

To Increase the Weight of Coffee 

The roasted beans are plunged in a 5 
per cent solution of borax and then let 
dry. The borax makes them shine and 
absorbs water, thus adding to the 
weight of coffee. The way to distinguish 
this adulteration is to dry the coffee, and 
if it looses over 4 per cent in weight 
there has been a fraudulent absorption 
of water. 

Cereal Coffee 

This formula, only it is given in a 
small amount, is used by one of the larg- 
est concerns in the U. S. Mix up a 
small amount and try it. 

3*2 Quarts of Bran. 

\% Quarts of Corn Meal 

1 Pint of New Orleans Molasses. 

1 cup of Hot Water.

Rye 12 lbs. 

Horse Beans 1 lb. 

Roast in a big open pan over a quick 
fire, greasing the pan with butter. When

KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



roasted, cool and grind in a coffee mill 
with 34 pound of cassia buds. Mix 1 
pound of ground chicory with the ground 
cereal coffee and it is ready for use in 
place of the ordinary coffee. 



Tea Fortifier and Improver 

Baking Soda x / 2 lb - 

Powdered Borax % oz - 

Otto of Roses 5 drops 

Mix thoroughly. Use as much of the 
powder as will lay on a dime to a teapot 
holding six cups of tea. Wrap in waxed 
paper for sale. This will make a poor 
tea good. 

Coffeeline 

Coffeline, or "coffee essence" is made 
as follows: 

Best Ground Coffee 6 lbs. 

Best Ground Chicory 3 lbs. 

Boil gently in a covered sauce pan 
with 3 gallons of water, and when cold 
strain and press thoroughly, and add 
enough water to make 3 gallons of the 
extract. To this add: 

Pure Alcohol % pt. 

Pure Glycerine 24 fl. ozs. 

And enough simple syrup to make 6 
gallons. Mix thoroughly and put up in 
bottles holding one pint. 

Directions for use: Use 1 tablespoon- 
fultoacupof boiling water, little hot 
milk or cream may be added if desised. 
Simple syrup is made by dissolving 40 
pounds of lump sugar in 2 gallons of 
water by as gentle a heat as possible, 
then strain. Chicory neutralizes the 
bad effects of coffee, improves the flavor, 
imparts to it wholesome and beneficial 
qualities, and renders it perfectly harm- 
less to old and young. 

Fire Extinguisher Powder 

A superior fire extinguisher powder is 
made as follows and there is plenty of 
money in it. 

Take: 

Common Salt 8 lbs. 

Sodium Bicarbonate 6 lbs. 

Glauber's Salt 2 lbs. 

Calcium Chloride 2 lbs. 

Sodium Silicate 2 lbs. 



Mix thoroughly and pack in tin tubes 
about twenty inches long and two inches 
in diameter. The tubes should be closed 
at one end and be provided with a screw 
cap on the other. To extinguish a fire, 
remove the cap and scatter the contents 
of the tube on the flame. When the 
powder comes in contact with the fire it 
generates a gas which smothers the 
flame. The extinguisher retails for 83.00 
but can be made for a few cents. The 
usual wholesale price is 812.00 per dozen. 



Vinegar 

To produce a vinegar at about 3 cents 
per gallon, 40 to 45 grains and that which 
will keep pickles, write to Messrs. Kelso 
& Co., Chicago, 111., and request them to 
send you a sample of their "Vinegar 
Essence" and instructions for making 
the vinegar and you will be able to turn 
out vinegar in any quantity. 



Egg Preserving 

1 qt. Waterglass. 

10 qts. Water. 

Waterglass is a thick syrup and costs 
at wholesale about 1% cents per pound 
in carboy lots. The retail price varies, 
sometimes as high as 10c per pound is 
charged. If the waterglass powder is 
used, then less amount is required. Pure 
water only should be used and it should 
be boiled and allowed to cool before using 
it. They should be packed in clean bar- 
rels and stored where it is cool. If placed 
where it is too warm, silicate deposits on 
the shell and the eggs do not keep well. 

Do not wash the eggs before packing. 
One gallon of the solution is sufficient 
for 50 dozen of eggs if they are properly 
packed, so you see this is a very cheap 
method. 

Window Steam Preventer 

Green Castile Soap, cut small % oz - 

Alcohol (kind called Colum- 
bian Spirits is best) 4 ozs 

Glycerine 1 oz. 

Water 2 pts. 

Dissolve the soap in the water, hot, 
let it stand for a day, shaking often 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS

Then filter through paper and to the 
clear solution add the others. 

Directions: Wet a chamois leather 
with the soultion and rub over the win- 
dow, taking care not to smear. Do not 
let the windows dry. Six ounce bottles 
sell for twenty-five cents. 



Preserving All Kinds of Fruit 

This formula has been sold all over 
the country for $10.00, though perhaps 
$10.00 is a big price for it. Those who 
have used the process claim that it is 
alright and that you can can fruit with- 
out any cooking or the use of sugar. 

Take: 

Sulphur 8 ozs. 

Pulverized Saltpeter 1 oz. 

Pulverized Licorice Root 1 oz. 

Mix all thoroughly. The cost will be 
small. This is your preserving powder. 

Peel and slice your apples. You will 
need several plates and cups and a six 
gallon jar. Set a cup on a plate, pile 
apples on a plate about one and one- 
half inches deep and let the whole in 
the bottom of your jar. Fix another 
plate like the first and set it on the cup 
in the jar, and continue until the last 
plate reaches nearly the top of the jar. 
On the top of the last plate, set the tin 
cover of a baking powder can, and 
in this plate a round tablespoonful of 
your powder. Take a red-hot coal from 
the fire and lay it on the powder, which 
will begin to burn. Cover the jar closely 
with a board to keep in the gas, as that 
is what preserves the fruit. Let stand 
an hour then pack the apples in glass 
jars, pushing them in tight, and screw 
on the covers. Do not expect the pow- 
der to be all burned, for as soon as the 
jar becomes full of gas it stops burning. 
Be sure and have a nice red coal and the 
powder will do the rest, provided the jar 
is covered well. When wanted for use 
spread the apples on a platter for an 
hour before cooking, and every bit of the 
sulphur will leave them. All kinds of 
fruit can be canned in the same way. A 
large can or tight box can be used for 



canning on larger scale. This is said to 
be perfectly harmless and very sour 
apples or fruit require much less sugar 
when so canned, as the gas neutralizes 
the acid in sour grapes, apples, etc., so 
less sugar is needed when cooked. 



New French Drink 

The following is a recipe given for its 
preparation by one of the leading manu- 
facturers of Bordeaux, France: 

100 lbs. Dried Apples. 

100 lbs. Raisins. 

100 gals. Water. 

Can use smaller quantities but use the 
same ratio. Put in open cask and let 
stand for three days; bottle with a half 
teaspoonful of sugar and a bit of cinna- 
mon for each bottle. Vary the flavor to 
suit the taste. The dried apples are the 
lowest grade and the raisins are also 
the cheapest. If put up in kegs use a 
preservative as given elsewhere. 



Rat, Mouse and Roach Exterminator 

One pint alcohol, % ounce cayenne 
pepper, 1 ounce powdered anise seed, % 
ounce saltpetre, 34 ounce white lead, 4 
ounces essence of hops. Steam this 
slowly for an hour, then add 30 drops 
Quassia. Let stand 48 hours, and add 
one gallon of water; bottle for use. To 
use, saturate bread, meat, etc., and lay it 
in their frequented places. In two nights 
not one will be seen.

ings. Wait about 8 or ]0 days and if not 
gone repeat as before. 



Preserving Eggs 

You will find a good many fakirs in 
selling egg formulas and you had better 
pass them all up. A firm located at New 
Concord, Ohio, have been doing a land 
office business for a number of years in 
the egg formula line. They would send 
you the formula for 50 cents and give 
you five directions how to proceed to 
make the solution, but the formula call- 
ed for "Hyper Samthire" which could 
be procured only through them for $2.50 
per box of 4 ounces or $10.00 per pound. 
The name was finely changed to "Algetta 
Borocylic," and a branch was located in 
California. A recent analysis of the 
compound proved to be nothing more or 
less than salicylic acid, which is worth 
but a few cents per pound. 

Below we give a formula and directions 
for putting up eggs which you may try 
on a small scale. The originator of this 
formula is clearing up the year round 
over 

$5,000 Per Year 

and it is claimed it will keep eggs to per- 
fection, and as the expense is nothing to 
try it, why not give it a thorough trial? 
It pays to buy eggs when they are cheap 
in the spring and summer and then put 
them up for winter use. To preserve 
eggs for one year take 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



55 



Common Baking Soda 1 lb. 

Pow. Borax 2 lbs. 

Mix thoroughly. 

Put up in 4 ounces boxes and sell for 
81.00. 

Directions for preserving eggs are- 
take one-half pound of unslacked lime, 
slack it with a little water, when com- 
pletely slacked and in a fine, white pow- 
der, put it into two gallons of cold water; 
add half pound of table salt and stir well 
at frequent intervals, for about a day, 
then let it settle and draw the clear 
liquid. Add to this clear, prepared liquid 
one full tablespoonful of the above mix- 
ture, first dissolved in about a pint of 
boiling water. This will preserve 10 doz- 
en of eggs, and the actual cost, next to 
nothing. When the eggs are taken out 
for sale, first dry them, and then brush 
on ivhiting, and you will be able to fool 
an egg expert, regarding the freshness of 
the eggs. This solution can be put in a 
jar, barrel, tub or any clean vessel, and 
the eggs put in a few at a time. Put in 
no more eggs than the liquid will cover. 
The eggs must be kept covered with the 
liquid, all the time. This can be accom- 
plished by putting a cloth over the eggs 
and laying a board on the cloth, with 
some stone or weight to keep the eggs 
under the solution. Leave the eggs in 
the solution until you are ready to sell 
them, and then take out and pack as 
you would fresh eggs. Important — Be 
careful to put only fresh eggs in the 
liquid.

Sea Foam 

The mistake made by most druggists, 
who start out to compound a "dry" sham- 
poo of the nature of "sea foam," is in 
the directions of overloading the mix- 
ture with soap. The principal ingre- 
dients should be a volatile alkali. A 
"sea foam" is intended to be supplied in 
small quantities and the hair rubbed 
with the fingers until nearly dry, the last 
traces being removed by a wet towel. 
The liquid should be rather strong of 
ammonia, the spirit of ammonia being 
superior to water of ammonia. A satis- 
factory article may be produced as fol- 
lows: 

Spirit of Ammonia 3 ozs. 

Alcohol 1 oz. 

Vanillin 1 gr.

$io Formula for Sharpening Razors 

Sometime ago the writer was in a 
barber shop, and while there a smooth 
talking young man dropped in and pro- 
ceeded to sell a formula and right to use 
of same, of a composition to save time in 
honing razors. The article, in question, 
would save nine-tenths of the time in 
honing, and it was soon figured out how 
much the barber would be ahead in the 
deal. It would be useless to say the 
barber didn't buy, for he did. An analy- 
sis of the same proved to be simply mu- 
riatic acid and water, in the proportion 
of one part of muriatic to nineteen parts 
of water. The use of the solution brings 
up a keen edge and no doubt but will do 



58 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



all that is claimed for it. Try it. The 
directions the young man gave was to let 
the razor blade remain in the solution for 
30 minutes before honing and stropping. 



of this in your extract, just to suit your 
taste, say 15, 20 or 30 per cent. 



Hair Restorer 

Here is a correct formula of a well ad- 
vertised hair restorer, upon which a fort- 
une has been made: 

Resorcin 3 drs. 

Tincture Capsicum 1 oz. 

Tincture Quilliaya 2 ozs. 

Glycerine 4 drs. 

Tincture Cantharides. . . 6 drs. 

Spirit Rosemary 3 ozs. 

Rose Water enough to make a 

total of 16 ozs. 



Prune Juice 

We give you here a formula that is 
more than worth the price of several 
books, and that is a formula for Prune 
Jucce. This formula really belongs in 
the extract department. Pure Prune 
Juice of this quality sells at $2.50 to $3.00 
per gallon in barrel lots; you can pro- 
duce the same quality for 50 to 60 cents 
per gallon and know it to be absolutely 
pure. Prune Juice will improve the 
quality of your vanilla extract and will 
answer the purpose of tincture of vanil- 
la, which sold for $7.00 to $8.00 per gal- 
lon. It will give a fine fruity flavor (bakers 
and manufacturers of cookies take no- 
tice,) which cannot be equalled in impart- 
ing fine fruity flavor to cakes and cookies. 
You can make the juice this way: Take 
2 lbs. Black Turkish (or Santa Clara, 
California) prunes and stone them, (or 
use them without stoning, or you can 
stone them after they have been soaked 
in the liquor; before washing them in wa- 
ter and throwing them away) put on them 
1 quart of alcohol and 3 quarts of water, 
let stand 10 days or longer. Don't boil. 
Don't crush, but strain off the liquor, 
then wash prunes with water, so as not 
to throw away any alcohol. Filter pro- 
duct if necessary. This will answer about 
the same purpose as tincture of vanilla, 
when used in connection with vanillin, 
coumarin, etc. You may use any amount 



Miscellaneous Formulas 



Poultry Tonic 

The following is a formula for a poultry 
tonic which has been advertised very 
extensively over the country for the past 
few years, and the originator of it claims 
to have sold 20,000 of them at $1.00 
each. 

Copperas 24 ozs. 

Blue Vitriol 1 oz. 

Cayenne Pepper 8 ozs. 

Nitrate of Potassium 1 oz. 

Venetian Red 16 ozs. 

Laying hens, tablespoonf ul to 2 gallons 
of feed; sick hens, double the dose. Feed 
once or twice a dav. 



A $5.00 Vermin Remedy 

The following has been sold all over 
the west for $5.00, and those who have 
tried the remedy pronounce it to be all 
O.K. 

For skunks, coyotes and such, take a 
piece of brimstone the size of a walnut, 
split a dry stick and press the brimstone 
into the stick. Place the stick and brim- 
stone in turpentine, use a small pail for 
the turpentine. Light the stick with a 
match and drop it into the den while 
blazing. After about three minutes, 
close up the hole with sod, and it is good- 
bye to vermin; but be careful and not 
choke the fire by pressing the sod too 
tight in the hole. 



Grape Juice 

A large amount of Grape Juice now on 
the market contains nothing more, ac- 
cording to a chemical analysis recently 
made, than sweet cider colored with a 
coal tar dye. Any of the supply houses 
furnish the coloring dye. Flavor and 
preserve with an antiseptic. 

Orange Cider 

The following formula for orange cider 
belongs in another part of the book. 
Some manufacturers use it, but you will 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



59 



find it is not as good as given in the 
Cider department: 

Citric Acid 4 ozs. 

Phosphoric Acid 2 ozs. 

Boric Acid 1 dr. 

Water and Syrup to make 1 gal. 
Orange Extract q. s. 
Orange Color q. s. 

This quantity of boric acid may cause 
fermentation, and if it does it will have 
to be increased a trifle. If, however, 
boric acid is used in too large quantities 
it may prove injurious. 



First=Class Carbolic Salve 

White Beeswax , 2!.< ozs. 

Linseed Oil B ozs. 

Carbolic Acid 3 drs. 

Melt the oil and beeswax together and 
pour in the carbolic acid, and pack in 
wide mouth bottles or boxes. 

Turpentine Salve 

Take equal parts of sweet oil, white 
beeswax and turpentine and prepare 
same as above for Carbolic salve. This 
is very fine for burns, etc. 

Photo Paste 

Every office should make their own 
paste, as the cost is trifling when made 
according to the following formula: 

Wheat Flour 1 lb. 

Water 2 pints 

Nictric Acid % oz. 

Boracic Acid 40 grs. 

Oil of Cloves 20 mms. 

Mix the flour, boracic acid and water, 
and strain; add the nitric acid, apply 
heat and stir until the mixture thickens; 
when nearly cold add the oil of cloves. 
Try this. It will keep sweet until used. 

Grease Remover 

A recent analysis of one of the many 
"grease removers" on the market turned 
out to be as follows: 

Sulphuric Ether 1 oz. 

Benzine 8 ozs. 

Best Alcohol 1 oz. 

Essence of Lemon ;l t dr. 

It usually sells for 10c per ounce. Take 
a clean piece of flannel and wet with re- 
mover and sponge over the goods. 



Hecktograph Composition 

A good many firms are making money 
out of Hecktographs, and if you want a 
formula you will find the following a 
very good one: Take 3 ozs. gelatine, 
pour over enough water to cover it and 
let stand say, 12 hours or longer, and 
then pour off all the water not absorbed. 
Next you may heat 20 ozs. of glycerine, 
and while hot add the gelatine, which 
has been soaked, and stir until it has 
been dissolved. Add 60 drops oil of 
cloves and stir thoroughly. Get some 
tin trays, the size you desire and A ± inch 
deep, and pour in and when it is set it 
is ready for use. 

To make the hecktograph ink, 40 grs. 
of any water soluble aniline color in 1 oz. 
hot water, adding, say, 1 oz. of glycerine, 
and shaking. 



French Reviver 

If you want something good for pol- 
ishing pianos, show cases, etc., in fact 
anything where a high polish is desired, 
try the following: 

Cider Vinegar 1 oz. 

Gum Camphor \^ oz. 

Spirit of Hartshorn 1 dr. 

Butter of Antimony i ^ oz. 

Linseed Oil i ozs. 

The gum camphor should be dissolved 
in the oil by gentle heat, then add the 
others slowly and use considerable 
"shake." Below we give a formula for 
making a quick Jell^ Powder, and as 
there is a great deal of it sold it may 
prove a good seller with you. 



Jelly Powder 

Powdered Sugar 1 lb. 

Powdered Gelatine 4 ozs. 

Powdered Tartaric Acid }4 oz. 

Oil of Lemon, say about l ., oz. 

Mix well. Dissolve 4 ozs. of this com- 
position in % pint of boiling water. For 
orange flavor use % oz - oil of orange; for 
raspberry, use 1 oz. of essence of rasp- 
berry; for strawberry, use 1 oz. essence 
of strawberry; for wild cherry use % oz. 
of essence of wild cherry. Of course it 
will be necessary to use artificial colors

for these, which may be had from any of 
the supply dealers. 

Custard Powder 

The writer doesn't know whether this 
is a very good seller or not, though he 
occasionally runs across lady agents sell- 
ing it. It ought to sell in the winter 
time when eggs are high. You may try 
this: Powdered arrow root, y 2 lb.; corn 
flour, % lb.; powdered sugar, 4 ozs.; 
powdered tumeric, y± oz.; oil of bitter 
almonds, 15 drops; oil of nutmeg, say 13 
drops. 

Directions are to mix all the powders 
well by sieving and then add the oils and 
mix again. % ounce of this boiled with 
a pint of milk will make a delicious 
custard or pudding. 



absorb enough in a liniment to do harm 
in the constant use of same. 



Plate Glass Polish 

In an Illinois town the writer ran 
across a man who wasselling any amount 
of a plate glass polish and coining money. 
He said it was the very best thing on 
the market and gave the following form- 
ula for making it: Powdered Kaolin, 16 
ozs.; Calcined Magnesia, 8 ozs.; Benzine, 
2 quarts: strong liquid Ammonia, 2*4 
pints. Mix the powders thoroughly and 
work into a paste with a little of the 
benzine, and then you may add rest of 
benzine and ammonia. Shake. Apply 
with a piece of flannel and then wipe 
with a dry flannel. 



White Liniment 

For a white liniment try the following 
formula for toothache, headache, sprains, 
etc.: 

Oil of Mustard ^ oz. 

Gum Camphor i^ oz. 

Oil Eucalyptus 1 oz. 

Alcohol, best 1 pint 

Direction*: Apply to the parts affected. 
Instead of using grain alcohol, a good 
many formuals call for wood alcohol. Do 
not think any liniment should contain 
wood alcohol except when used for 
stock, as wood alcohol is a deadly poison 
and has been proven that the system will 



Chicago Furniture Polish 

The following formula will make this 
furniture polish and will give good 
satisfaction: 

Raw Oil, say y 2 gallon 

Butter Antimony % pint 

Alcohol Shellac Varnish 1 pint 

Turpentine to make one gallon. 

Directions: Apply with a rag and 
rub till dry and glossy. 



Pile Ointment— good one 

Tannic Acid 20 grains 

Ext. Strommonium 12 grains 

Bismuth Subnitrate 60 grains 

Lanolin % oz. 

Petrolatum l / z oz. 

Apply as needed. 



Fire Extinguishing Powder 

Fire Extinguishing Powder is a good 
seller and there are a number of firms 
who are getting rich out of this business. 
The powder and the liquid preparations 
are all right as far as they go. 

The writer can point out one firm who 
is clearing up 820,000 a year through 
agents. Try this: 

Common Salt 96 lbs. 

Sulphate of Soda 24 lbs. 

Siliciate of Soda 24 lbs. 

Baking Soda 72 lbs. 

Chloride of Calcium 24 lbs. 

Ground Rice 12 lbs. 

Ingredients must be all dry and in fine 
powder and mix thoroughly through 
sieve; preparations of this kind should 
always pass through the sieve at least 
three or four times so as to get evenly 
mixed through and through. Without 
the ground rice being in, the preparation 
would likely pack during wet and damp 
weather. This powder is sold mostly in 
long tin tubes, nicely painted or labeled, 
and are about fifteen inches long and 
one and one-half or two inches in diame- 
ter. So the powder may be thrown out 
evenly you should fix pieces of wire 
across to form a net work. The tube 



KRAMER'S BOOK OF TRADE SECRETS 



&1 



sells readily at $1.00 to 83.00 each— the 
cost is but a few cents, especially when 
the tube is made out of cardboard. 



Paint Remover 

A very good one on the market is one 
pound of ParafBne dissolved in Benzol to 
make one gallon. Apply with a brush, 
let stand a minute or till the paint is 
soft and then remove the paint with a 
scraper. 



A Good Salve 

You will find the following to give 
good satisfaction: 

Petrolatum 1 lb. 

Pow. Camphor }<£ oz - 

Carbolic Acid j| oz. 

Oil of Lavender 34 oz. 

Apply as needed. 

Gloss Ink 

If you want to make a gloss ink and if 
in a hurry you may add one-half ounce 
of Fluid Waterglass to three ounces of 
any colored ink and shake well. 



VANILLIN 

Our Vanillin (made for us by The Bulls Ferry 
Chemical Co.) is more like the former imported article, 
for which you had to pay from $1.25 to $5.00 per ounce, 
than is any other on the market. The price of it is 
no higher than the inferior brands; we will sell you a 
trial quantity at the market price and make you a low 
price for contract. 

EGG ALBUMEN 

We import largely Russian, German, Austrian and 
Chinese Egg Albumen, and are always in position to 
make low quotations for prime goods. 

EGG YELLOW 

The Egg Yellow that we handle is the reddish 
shade, not the green shade, and is made especially for 
us in Switzerland. We also have the other colors 
you require. 

We do not handle a general line of supplies, our 
specialties are: 

Vanillin, Egg Albumen, Egg Yellow and other 
colors, Coumarin, Lemon Oil

The excellence of the Practical Druggist Home Study Course lies in its 
remarkable fullness, clearness, and simplicity. All useless technicalties are 
avoided, the instructions given are personal and adapted to each student 
in a simple conversational language. J. R. Gould, Bell Bend. Pa., writes: 
"I am highly pleased with your lectures. Have learned more already in 
chemical equations, etc., and metric system, than I did in the Junior 
Course in the College of Pharmacy. You make everything so plain that 
it is impossible not to understand." 

Another student writes: " Your course is absolutely perfect. I ought 
to know, because I have taken two other mail courses, and neither helped 
me to any extent in my attempts to pass an examination. Your course not 
only helped me to pass the board successfully, but it also helped me to pass 
the Regent's examination in chemistry with 96 per cent. The other courses 
may be lower priced and give more in bulk, but their explanations are poor 
and unsatisfactory. One might as well take one of the text-books on phar- 
macy. 1 recommend all my friends to use the Practical Druggist 
Course, as there is nothing to be compared to it." 

It is very easy to send big lectures, filled with miscellaneous matter, 
but the question is: Does the student understand the subject properly and 
can he digest it? If quanity alone counted, the cheapest way would be to 
buy for four or five dollars a big text-book on Pharmacy and Chemistry. 
But the trouble is, the average student does not understand the text-books. 
All such defects are remedied by the Practical Druggist Course. With 
a minimum compass it gives absolutely everything that is essential for the 
retail pharmacist to know and what he must know if he wants to reach his 
object: that of Passing the Board and becoming a licensed, independent, 
and competent pharmacist. 

While passing the board of pharmacy examination should not be 
the final goal of the best and most successful pharmacist, that is neverthe- 
less the first thing he must accomplish if he does not want to remain an 
underpaid, overworked drudge— or a junior clerk. Nothing will help you 
so much to gain independence, knowledge, and a license, as a course in the 
Practical Druggist Institute. Sample lectures free.

DO IT NOW! 



My Dear Friend. — 

If you are interested in various phases of advanced thought, rational 
hygiene and practical phychology, I will be pleased to send you a sam- 
ple copy of Suggestion for your consideration. 

Suggestion is a journal of the New Psychology for health, happiness, 
and success; it teaches how to apply the great basic Law of Suggestion in 
the everyday affairs of life through auto-suggestion. How shall I succeed 
in life? Suggestion is the publication that points the way. It is the only 
publication in the world that shows why some fail and why some succeed; 
the teachings of Suggestion, if followed consistently, will turn sickness in- 
to health, despondency into cheerfulness and failure into brilliant success. 
Why not read Suggestion? Why not understand the secret of power, 
health, success? Why not? Do it Now. 

Suggestion deals with the following subjects of vital interest to 
mankind: — 

Drugless Healing, Auto Suggestion, 

Nature Cure, Suggestive Therapeutics, 

Psychic Research, New Psychology, 

Advanced Thought, Personal Magnetism, 

Memory and Will Culture, 

and in general the principles of the New Psychology for Health, Happiness 
and Success. 

Suggestion is a magazine for thinkers; for those who will not shy at 
an idea; for those who do not use predigested thought; for those who wear 
no tag or brand or collar; for those who want facts. 

Do you want to see a copy of a magazine that is an exponent of such 
ideas? Send a postal card— 



Herbert A. Parkyn, M. D., Editor 

4020 Drexel Boulevard, Chicago 



If you arc a subscriber to Suggestion or are not interested, would you kindly 
mention this to a thinking friend?
