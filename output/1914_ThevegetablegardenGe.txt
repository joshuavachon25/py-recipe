in cold water, but they should not remain longer than a half 
hour. 

5. AVilted green vegetables may be freshened by first cutting 
them while beneath the surface of the water, and allowing 
them to stand for 10 or 15 minutes in the water. 

Send for government bulletin, Dept. of Agriculture, Wash- 
ington, D. C. (No. 256).

bed for the baby seeds. 



SPECIAL RULES FOR POTATOES 

1. Pare thinly to avoid removing most nutritive portion. 

2. Boil slowly so the potato cooks evenly. 

3. After draining, shake the potatoes gently in the pan in 
which they were boiled over the heat to dry them. 

4. Serve always in an uncovered dish. 

5. Baked potatoes: Scrub potatoes well and bake in hot oven 
or hot ashes, crack the potato open just as soon as soft to 
allow the steam to escape and keep the potato from being 
heavy and soggy. 



FEBRUARY. 




A FIELD OP RADISHES. 



LAYING OFF AND FERTILIZING THE GARDEN ; TRANS- 
PLANTING AND SEEDING IN THE OPExN. 

1. The vegetables will get more sunlight if the rows run north 
and south. 

2. Mark the distance apart the plants should stand when trans- 
planted. See plant table of last page. 

3. Transplant cabbage and lettuce from cold frame to field in 
rows 3 feet apart for cabbage and 18 to 24 inches apart in 
rows, lettuce in rows 12 to 15 inches apart, 8 to 10 in the 
rows. 

4. Transplant plants from hotbed to cold frame, usually set- 
ting 4 inches apart each way. 

5. If the soil is properly fertilized plant beets, radishes, tur- 
nips, peas and Irish potatoes. Notice table in back of book. 

6. If soil has not been properly fertilized spade under barn 
yard manure about 2 to 4 loads to 1-10 acre. 



10

possible and cook gently. 



II 

MARCH. 




A COLLECTION OF VEGETABLES READY FOR MARKET. 

GENERAL PLANTING OF THE GARDEN. 

1. In Southern Louisiana all the available space in the garden 
should be filled this month. 

2. Plant bush and pole beans, squash, cucumbers, melons, 
okra and sweet corn as soon as the soil is warm and mellow 
and works well. See table in back of book. 

3. Transplant tomatoes, eggplants and bell peppers in the 
garden after the danger of frost is over. See table in back 
of book. 

4. Look out for cut worms; they hide in the earth around the 
base of the plant. 

5. Do not spread stable manure on the land just before trans- 
planting tomatoes. 

To kill cut worms: Mix 1 cupful wheat bran with molasses 
to hold it together, adding % teaspoon paris green; make into 
small balls and drop around plants. 



12 

SPECIAL RULES FOR TOMATOES. 

1. If you are cooking the tomatoes to serve as a vegetable, cook 
in uncovered vessel. 

2. If you are cooking tomatoes for a soup, cook them covered. 

3. Special rules for cooking rice: Wash rice through at least 
six waters, or until all cloudiness is removed. Drain thor- 
oughly. Bring to the boiling point three brimful cups of 
water. Add the salt and a tiny bit of lard. When water 
is boiling briskly add the rice gradually, so as not to stop 
the boiling. Don't stir. The grains should be kept moving 
by the boiling water. Cook about fifteen minutes, during this 
time the cover pushed to one side. At the end of the fifteen 
minutes the grains should be soft, not the least gritty. Re- 
move the cover and at the same heat let dry out for five min- 
utes. If cooking on gas stove, at the end of five minutes 
lower gas and let the drying out process continue for twenty 
to thirty minutes longer. If cooking on a wood or coke 
stove, at the end of the five minutes place cooked rice on 
back of stove or in oven to dry out. When cooked each 
grain will be puffed to almost three times the size of the un- 
cooked grain. Always cook rice with a lid over the flame. 
On gas stoves an asbestos lid is recommended. Never stir 
rice while cooking. If lard is objected to it can be omitted. 
It lends a brilliancy to the cooked product. 

BAKING POWDER BISCUITS. 

1. 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon salt, 4 teaspoons baking powder, 2 
tablespoons lard, 1 cup of milk. Mix and sift dry ingredi- 
ents, cut in lard with two knives, add gradually enough of 
the fluid to make a soft dough (it is impossible to determine 
the exact amount of liquid owing to difference in flour) , toss 
on a floured board and roll lightly to a half-inch in thick- 
ness, cut with a biscuit cutter, place in a pan and bake in a 
hot oven fifteen minutes. 

Caution: Handle as little as possible.

CULTIVATING THE VARIOUS CROPS. 

In North Louisiana the tender vegetables, «uch as beans, 

cucumbers, etc., may have to be planted during the early 

part of this month after a severe winter. 

Keep the garden well worked with prong hoe. 

Cultivate often ; no weeds or grasses should appear in a well 

kept garden. 

Train the tomatoes to stakes and prune them by pinching 

out the suckers which appear between the main stalk and 

leaf stem. 



14 
MAY. 




STRAWBERRIES. 

CULTIVATION CONTINUED. 

1. Work with all your might ; keep down weeds and grasses. 

2. Ground from which crops have been harvested may be 
planted to okra, butter beans, corn and sweet potatoes. See 
table in back of book. 

3. Watch for worms and bugs; kill them. 

4. Catch a toad and keep him in your garden; insects taste 
good to him. 

5. Let no weeds go to seed. 



FOR A DELICIOUS STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE. 

. Use biscuit dough baked in cake tin, split through the center, 
butter well, add sweetened curshed strawberries, sprinkle 
top with powdered sugar and decorate with whole berries. 
This may be served with plain cream or whipped cream. 

. Artichokes. Serve with mutton or as a salad.

PREPARING AND PLANTING THE PALL GARDEN. 

1. Two hundred pounds of a good brand of cotton fertilizer or a 
mixture of equal parts of cotton seed meal and acid phos- 
phate to one-tenth of an acre may be necessary on soils of 
average fertility. 

2. Begin to plant for fall garden. 

3. Plant cabbage, cauliflower and tomatoes in hills in the gar- 
den. See table in the back of the book. 



2. 



PEANUT BUTTER. 

Shell freshly roasted peanuts, remove the skin; now grind 

the nuts and work to a smooth paste, adding enough salt to 

season. 

Sometimes when the nuts are not oily enough a little butter 

or olive oil is worked into the paste. 



18 
AUGUST. 




YOUNG PLANTS IN OUTDOOR SEED BED. 

PLANTING OP FALL CROPS CONTINUED. 

1. This is the time when most of the fall garden is planted. 

2. Plant radishes, beets, turnips, bush beans, lettuce, mustard, 
cabbage, fall Irish potatoes, shallots and onion sets. See 
the table in the back of the book. 

3. Cabbage worms should be hand picked or poisoned with 
powdered arsenate of lead by dusting lightly from a cheese 
cloth sack. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS FOR CANNING VEGETA- 
BLES. 
Most people believe there is some mystery about canning. 
The secret of canning all vegetables, first, is absolute cleanliness 
and sterilization. To begin, good fresh vegetables are necessary; 
withered vegetables do not make a good canned product. Cans 
should be scalded, jars must be covered with cold water, allowed 
to boil fifteen minutes, filled with clean vegetables or fruit, ster- 
ilised and sealed air tight. This done, there is no danger of your 
product not keeping. Follow recipes in government bulletins 
Nos. 521, 359, 203. 

Different vegetables and fruit have to be sterilized or proc- 
essed for different length of time. 



19 
SEPTEMBER. 




DRY ONIONS PROPERLY TRIMMED AND READY FOR MARKET. 

PLANTING HARDY VEGETABLES FOR THE WINTER 

GARDEN. 

1. Sow onion seed after September 15 in Southern Louisi- 
ana for spring crop or green onions for late winter. 

2. Plant all vegetables mentioned for August except Irish pota- 
toes and bush beans. 

3. Plant lice should be killed with a whale-oil soap spray; 
about 1 pound to 8 or 10 gallons of water. 

4. Set strawberry plants during this month. 



20 

CREAMED ONIONS. 

Put onions in cold water, remove skins while under water, 
drain, put in boiling salted water; boil 5 minutes, drain and 
again cover with boiling water; cook until soft but not broken 
drain and cover with a thin white sauce. 

White Sauce. — Melt 2 tablespoons butter and add l 1 /) table 
spoons of flour, y± teaspoon salt and a few grain? of pepper 
then add gradually the cup of scalded milk, adding about y s a t 
a time, stirring until well mixed, then beating until it thickens 
and is smooth. 

Pickled Onions. — Peel small white onions, cover with brine, 
allowing l 1 /!' cups salt to 2 quarts of boiling water, and let stand 
2 days; drain and cover with more brine and let stand 2 days 
and again drain; make more brine and heat to boiling, put in 
onions and boil 3 minutes, piit in jars, with bits of mace, white 
pepper, corn cloves, bayleaf and red peppers; fill jars to over- 
flowing with vinegar scalded with sugar, allowing 1 cup sugar 
to 1 gallou. Cork while hot. 



21 
OCTOBER. 




BEANS READY TO PICK PROM AUGUST SOWING. 

HARVESTING THE SUMMER PLANTINGS. 

1. Any available space in the garden may be filled with root 
crops, such as turnips and radishes ; also spinach, lettuce, etc. 

2. Cabbage may also be planted in South Louisiana. 

3. In North Louisiana build a cold frame. 

4. Select a protected spot for the cold frame. Put a 1 x 12-inch 
plank 10 to 12 feet long on edge, supporting it with pegs. 
Four or five feet in fiont of this place a 1 x 6-inch plank 
of same length. Board up the ends, making a box. About 
every 2 or 3 feet nail a narrow strip from the back to the 
front to hold up the cloth covering. One edge of this cloth 
should be tacked to the back of the frame, the other edge 
extending several inches over the front. It is a good plan 
to hem the front edge and place a pole through this hem. 
This pole will serve to weight the cloth down when the cold 
frame is closed. It will also be convenient to roll the cloth 
on in ventilating. 



22 
NOVEMBER. 




MEMBER OP BOYS' CORN CLUB IN HIS CORN FIELD. 

PREPARING FOR WINTER. 

1. In North Louisiana onions and cabbage seed should be plant- 
ed in cold frames for transplanting during the winter. 

2. In South Louisiana keep all ground busy growing the hard- 
ier crops, such as lettuce, spinach, radishes, mustard, turnips, 
carrots, etc. 

3. Try to give all the land a dressing of manure and commercial 
fertilizer at least twice a year. 

COMBINATION. 

RICE, TOMATOES AND BELL PEPPER. 

Use deep baking dish, well greased; cover the bottom with 
about 1 inch of cooked rice; above this put in a thin layer of 
tomatoes ; season well with butter, salt and bell peppers cut in 
small pieces; continue a layer of rice and a layer of tomatoes 
until top is reached ; cover top with layer of bread crumbs ; bake. 
Top may be sprinkled with cheese before bread crumbs are added. 



23 



BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Pick over blackberries ; mash a few in the bottom of a pre- 
serving kettle, using a wooden spoon or a potato masher, and 
continue mashing until fruit is used ; heat slowly to boiling point 
and add gradually an equal quantity of heated sugar. Cook 
slowly 45 minutes; put in stone jar or tumblers. Blackberries 
and raspberries are fruits most often used for making jam and 
both require equal weight of sugar. 



MAYHAW JELLY. 

Follow recipe for apple jelly. Wash, remove stem and blos- 
som end. Put in granite or porcelain preserving kettle and add 
cold water to come nearly to top of apples ; cover and cook slowly 
until apples are soft; mash, draw through a coarse sieve; avoid 
squeezing apples, which makes jelly cloudy. Then allow juice 
to drip through a double thickness of cheese cloth or jelly bag. 
Boil juice 20 minutes, add equal quantity of sugar, boil 5 min- 
utes, skim and if a spoonful will jell when tried in a cold saucer, 
turn it into glasses. Put in a sunny window and let stand 24 
hours; cover and keep in a cool, dark place. (Mayhaws may be 
left whole.) 



24 
DECEMBER. 




GROUND AROUND EVERY HOUSE SHOULD BE SHADED BY 
SUCH TREES. 

MAKING OUT YEARLY REPORT. 

1. Prepare a record of your year's work. 

2. You should have grown two or more crops on the same land 
during the year. 

3. Take good care of your plants in the cold frame in North 
Louisiana, airing them occasionally. 

4. Plan for the hotbed and cold frame in South Louisiana.
