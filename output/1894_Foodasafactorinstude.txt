SOCIAL AND DOMESTIC CONDITIONS OF THE 
INVESTIGATION. 



CHARACTER OF INVESTIGATION. 

It has seemed fitting to many students of sociology that 
there should be exemplified in some college or other educational 
institution the possibilities of healthful physical and mental life, 
as they have been made known by recent advances in both 
social and physiological science. Under the auspices of the 
University of Chicago, a practical study of the subject has been 
made. Its results seem of sufficient value and interest to war- 
rant the presentation of a brief account of them. 

NEGLECT OF DIETETICS. 

In nearly every state in the Union there is an agricultural 
experiment station, and in many there are agricultural colleges. 
The government, representing the people, in this way expends 
large sums annually for the study of the food of cattle and other 
animals, but it rarely makes any appropriation for the study of 
the food of any citizen, even though his body and brain may 
represent hundreds of thousands of dollars in invested capital, 
while the brute animal is worth only one or two hundred 
dollars. 

HUMAN BODY AS A MACHINE. 

The animal body both of brute and of human being is a living 
machine, capable of doing work — raising weights, pulling loads 
and the like. The power of the engine to do its work comes 
from the consumption of fuel — the burning of wood, coal, or gas. 
The power of the animal body to do its work comes from the 



4 FOOD AS A FACTOR 

consumption of fuel which is furnished to it in the form of food. 
Animals are more economical machines than the most perfect 
steam-engine. The latter cannot convert more than one eighth 
of its available energ}- into work ; the animal may yield as much 
as one fifth. In spite of its superiority, however, it is incapable 
of evolving something from nothing. Nevertheless, it is a 
common delusion that the animal can go on and do its work 
indefinitely without fuel, and, therefore, that it has nothing 
in common with the locomotive or engine. The reason for this 
delusion is that the latter runs only so long as the supply of 
visible fuel lasts and then stops dead ; while the human body 
runs on comfortably for a long time with very little fuel, and it 
may keep on for some three weeks without any visible supply at 
all. The explanation of this difference is that the body contains 
a store of fuel laid up in itself against the time of need. Fat is 
just as available as fuel when stored up in the body as if supplied 
from an external source. Five pounds of fat will last ten or 
twelve days, and the body will support itself on other reserve 
materials still longer. The work which the human machine can 
do may be measured by the same standard as the work of any 
machine, i. e., by the mechanical unit of energy, the foot ton, or 
the Calorie. The foot ton represents the amount of energy 
required to raise one ton one foot. The Calorie represents 
energy in the form of heat sufficient to raise one kilogram of 
water one degree Centigrade. One Calorie corresponds to 1.53 
foot tons. 

The animal body, however, is more than a machine. It 
requires fuel, not only to enable it to work, but it must live or 
exist, even though it does no work in the ordinary meaning of 
the term. About two thirds of the food eaten goes merely to 
sustain existence. While the inanimate machine is sent peri- 
odically to the repair shop, the living machine must do its own 
repairing day by day, and minute by minute. 

The food eaten over and above the amount needed to sustain 
life is the source of the energy which may be manifested in the 
power to think, to create artistic designs, to write essays and 
poems, to stimulate others to high endeavor, as well as in the 
activities which are more purely physical. When its importance 



IN STUDEN7 LIIE. 5 

is thus measured, it becomes a matter of wonder why the study 
of food is a subject that is so generally ignored. 

There is another phase of the subject which often escapes 
notice. It is not enough to shovel fuel into the locomotive. It 
must burn. So food must be assimilated and made a part of the 
body, and thus become the available capital of the brain. It is 
therefore necessary that the conditions of nutrition should be as 
favorable as possible. The engineer knows that he must not 
clog his drafts with smoke, nor load his fire-box with stony coal. 
The student does not seem to know that his fire of genius will 
not burn clear if he clogs his brain with irritating substances, loads 
his stomach with indigestible or semi-poisonous food, and neglects 
exercise and sleep. 

SPECIAL NEGLECT OF STUDENT DIETETICS. 

The prevalent disregard of the importance of human dietetics 
is especially noticeable in connection with the life of students. 
Farmers know that their oxen and horses must be well fed in 
order that they may do their best work. On the other hand, 
college trustees and professors too frequently think that they do 
their duty by their students if they provide a sufficiently heavy 
load to be hauled. If a student breaks down, the remark is 
heard on all sides, " What a pity he studied so hard," and no 
one asks, "Was he well fed?" 

PRESENT EXPERIMENT. 

It was the privilege of the University of Chicago to take the 
first step toward remedying this condition, undaunted by the 
evident difficulties which, owing to the apathy of the community 
in regard to such matters, seemed almost insurmountable. 

To make the experiment in a college was eminently suitable, 
and as young women are proverbially more exacting and critical 
as to the table than young men, and at the same time more 
conversant with household matters, it was quite appropriate to 
make the first trial in a women's dormitory. 

The conditions existing at the University of Chicago were 
very favorable for an experiment of this kind. The authorities 
were in sympathy with the movement and the students coming 
from alljparts of the world formed a cosmopolitan community. 



6 FOOD AS A FACTOR 

ARRANGEMENT OF BUILDINGS. 

Three well-appointed, adjoining buildings, each providing 
accommodations for about 40 students, were ready or nearly 
ready for occupancy. Each hall had its well-equipped dining 
room and serving room. Supplementary cooking apparatus only 
was placed in the two end buildings, the central kitchen, in which 
the bulk of the cooking was done, being placed in the central 
building, Kelly Hall. From this the food, ready cooked, was 
carried to the dining rooms. To these were admitted only the 
ofificers and students living in the houses and their guests, or the 
guests of the University. 

It was also at this time possible to secure not only the 
apparatus used in the widely known Rumford Kitchen at the 
World's Fair but also the invaluable services of its manager. 

THEORETICAL PLAN. 

The three halls were organized with the aim in view of estab- 
lishing a healthful mental and physical life for the 100 or more 
women who should live in them. In order to help secure the latter 
end, it was decided to provide a limited variety of food of the best 
attainable quality, prepared in the best manner, and selected so 
as to give sufficient nutriment in the right proportion. The low 
sum of three dollars and a half per week was the price tenta- 
tively fixed for board, in the hope that the advantages of life in 
the halls might thus be made possible to a large number of stu- 
dents. This theoretical plan was held very elastic in order to 
make it possible to adapt instantaneously the results of the study 
of the existing conditions. A working scheme having been 
established, it was hoped that the details might give to others a 
basis for further accomplishment. 

TIME COVERED. 

The time assigned to the experiment was from October i, 
1893, to April I, 1894. Owing to delays in obtaining possession 
of the halls, and to the difficulty in securing workmen or service 
during the last month of the World's Fair, the whole plant was 
not in full working order until nearly the end of the first quarter, 
so that in reality, the plan as perfected was in operation only 
three months. During that time the average number of students 
occupying the halls was 106. 



IN STUDENT LIFE. 7 

THE STAFF. 

The entire staff of service for the three halls included, 
besides the director of the experiment, three housekeepers, — 
one for each hall, — two indoor men, three cooks, one kitchen 
maid, seven waitresses, seven chambermaids, one scrubbing 
woman, one laundress, twenty-five persons in all. 

SOCIAL SIDE. 

The life in the Women's Quadrangle began without any fixed 
traditions save those which had been forming gradually, while 
the women students were temporarily residing in an apartment 
house during the first year of the University. 

It was the desire of the Deans that the new life should have 
as far as possible the simple quiet attractions of a home, and be 
freed from the objectionable features of an ordinary students' 
boarding house. Hence it was attempted to adopt the standard 
of living which prevails in good American homes, and it was 
deemed an economy of mental power, as well as of physical 
strength, to secure the relief of the students from duties which 
could be performed by others. The saving of time and potential 
energy which was thus effected, although involving consider- 
able outlay for service, was believed to outweigh the advantages 
which have been claimed for domestic work done by students 
themselves. The possibilities of the social side of the life were 
not overlooked. An element of educational value is added to a 
college home when hospitality may be extended with freedom 
and ease, and in the new University the contribution of the Wo- 
men's Halls to the general social life seemed of significance, 
apart from the direct benefit to those partaking in it. At best 
the life of any student living in a dormitory has a monastic 
tinge, a selfish or self-absorbed side unfavorable to the best 
development of character. Provision was therefore made not 
only for the occasional entertainment of guests privately, but for 
weekly receptions to members of the University and their friends, 
the expense of which should not be met by any special tax, but 
which should be included in the general price for board. This 
hospitality increased the expense of service far more than that 
of food, and it should be taken into consideration in comparing 
the cost of this experiment with that of any other institution. 



8 FOOD AS A FACTOR 

AUXILIARY MEASURES. 

To secure this amount of service and this freedom and dig- 
nity in the dining rooms for the limited sum of three and one half 
dollars a week would have been difificult with full numbers of 
paying members and with years of experience ; with two thirds 
the maximum number and with little or no precedent, it was 
not an easy task. It was evident that the outlay for food mate- 
rial must be kept as low as possible, but it was believed that 
inexpensive food, if it were at the same time wholesome and nu- 
tritious, would be eventually, if not at first, acceptable to the 
majority, provided that it could be made perfect of its kind, and 
could be served attractively. Special attention was therefore 
given to the choice of table ware, to the quality and freshness of 
the table linen, and to serving the food in courses and so quickly 
that it would be quite hot on reaching the table. The closest 
attention was paid to securing the greatest attainable digestibility 
of the food material by means of the best known methods of 
cookery. It seems to be true that for this purpose a low degree 
of heat applied for a greater length of time is in general more 
effective than a high degree applied for a shorter time ; hence the 
largest part of the cooking has been done with apparatus 
designed according to this idea. Coal, gas, steam and kerosene 
were all used as fuel, each in the most efficient form. 

It is, however, true that even the best methods of cookery 
will not always make an article of inferior grade equal to one of 
superior grade ; therefore special attention was given to securing 
the best quality of the food material bought. Even after the 
standard of quality was once set, constant vigilance was needed 
to maintain it, as is the common experience. Excellent cold 
storage facilities aided greatly in the possibilities of economical 
buying at wholesale rates. 

FINANCIAL RESULTS, 

The financial results were very satisfactory. By unremitting 
attention to every detail of expenditure and administration, the 
income was made to meet the entire cost of the experiment, 
although it had not been thought probable that, in addition to 
the current expenses, the extra items of the cost of the inaugura-

tion and the salary of the director of the experiment could be 
met within so short a time. These last expenses once incurred 
will not be needed again, and the sum thus saved can go in 
future for greater variety in food, repairs, replacement, etc. 

Since detailed records were kept of each item and of the 
time of service required for each part of the work, it has been 
possible to gain valuable information for future use. 

For instance, the following facts were learned as to the 
apportionment of the ^3.50 received per week, per person : 

For food, .... 

" condiments, tea, coffee, . . - 

" food of servants, ... 

" cooking food .... 

" serving food, ... 

Extra service in cleaning, laundry, and small expenses 
For expense of inauguration.

SUMMARY OF SCIENTIFIC RESULTS. 

The scientific results may be summed up as follows : The 
family was well fed, having, after all allowances for waste and 
refuse, a ration of equal food value to that furnished to the 
American soldier, if the relative weights of the man and woman 
are taken into consideration. The proportion of the several 
ingredients, as will be seen in the statement in Table VI, was also 
closely corresponding to the theoretical. 

An additional proof of the sufficiency of the food was the 
fact that nearly all gained in weight, in general physical con- 
dition, and were able to work with less headache than usual, in 
spite of the fact that fundamental principles of right livmg were 
occasionally ignored, as is unfortunately too frequently the case 
when the liberty of the individual is unrestricted. 

Lest it should be supposed that the simple diet necessitated 
monotony, there is taken from the record books the menu of 
three consecutive weeks in the most difficult month of the year, 
when the winter diet palls and the spring vegetables are yet costly. 

In order to indicate the liberality of the diet, there is given 
in the following pages a comparison of the quantity and cost of 
each class of food with that of the most economical dietary 
known to us, that of the Normal School and Business Institute 
at Valparaiso, Indiana, kindly furnished by Mr. O. P. Kinsey. 



lo FOOD AS A FACTOR 

Many other results of value from a scientific point of view 
might be deduced from the tables, notably the large proportion 
of food purchased which never reaches the table, and the large 
proportion of that so prepared which is not eaten. 

This is due in part to the method in vogue in the market of 
selling without trimming, so that each household has much gar- 
bage, and in part to careless ways of providing, and in part to 
the fact that service costs more than food, and that it is cheaper 
to lose one third of a bushel of potatoes by paring than to pay for 
careful peeling. 

COOPERATION OF HOUSEHOLD. 

As to the readiness with which the students accepted the diet, 
there is less assurance of complete success. So many people are 
in the habit of finding fault with whatever food is provided, and 
expect, usually with good reason, to have a choice of a dozen 
dishes, out of which number one or two may suit, that it would 
be unreasonable to expect that a simple, nourishing diet, known to 
be of low cost, would be entirely pleasing to every one, especially 
in a household made up of people used to the most varied stand- 
ards of living. It is not too much to say, however, that while a 
few of the college women failed to enter into the experiment 
with sympathy, the general body of students were pleased, and 
made frequent expressions of their interest and approval. 

A large measure of the success of the plan and its establish- 
ment on a firm foundation is due to the Heads of the Houses, Miss 
Myra Reynolds, Miss Elizabeth Wallace, and Miss F. C. Brown. 

The carrying out of the matter was entrusted to the Deans, 
Mrs. Alice Freeman Palmer and Miss Marion Talbot, with Mrs. 
Ellen H. Richards, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
as expert adviser, and Miss Maria Daniell as manager. Their 
efforts were ably seconded in a technical way by Miss S. E. 
Wentworth, of the New England Kitchen, Miss Antoinette Gary, 
Mrs. Biggers, Miss Knapp, and Miss Yeomans. 

The employees, although laboring under many difficulties 
with new kinds of apparatus, new methods of work and unusual 
division of labors, contributed largely to the success of the 
experiment by their willing efforts.

SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION. 

Table I. — Detailed Statement of the Cost and Composition of the Food 
Materials Used in the Kitchen at Kelly Hall, University of Chi- 
cago, during the Six Months from October 1 to April 1. 

The three most important classes of the nutritive ingredients of foods are proteids, 
fats, and carbohydrates. The human being must have enough of proteid or tissue 
building substance to malce up for the wear and tear of the body, and since many have 
not reached the period of full development, students must also be furnished with 
enough to allow also for growth. In the second place, there must be a supply of the en- 
ergy and heat producing ingredients of food, viz., tl>e proteids, fats and the carbohydrates. 
The right proportion of fat must be introduced in a palatable and digestible form, 
since there are indications that its general use in this country may in part account for 
the excess of energy of the American over his continental neighbors. It is becoming 
increasingly probable that fat in the daily diet is one of the most necessary ingredients 
for brain workers, partly for the reason above stated, that it is a storehouse of energy, 
but also in that it can produce energy without the intervention of some of the processes 
required in the conversion of starch. After the proteid and fat elements of the food 
are supplied, there remain the starch, sugars, etc., the so- called carbohydrates, which 
furnish the rest of the heat and energy needed by the body. 

The following table gives therefore not only the quantities and prices, but also the 
nutrients in the food material purchased and sent to the Kitchen.

FOOD AS A FACTOR 



Table III.— Tabular Statement of Bills of Fare of Three Consecutive 
WEEKS, WITH Costs and Quantities. 

Table III. gives bills of fare for a period of three consecutive weeks. These are 
presented with a view to showing the variety secured and the daily apportionment of 
expense. The proposed limit of expenditure was fixed at ^29.00 per day, or $0,223 per 
day per person for 130 persons fed. Any sum spent in excess of this on one day was 
necessarily offset by the choice of some less expensive articles of food on a following 
day. After some careful study it was learned that nearly the same amount of certain 
articles (constants) was used daily. Their value (13.51) deducted from the day's 
appropriation of $29.00 gave the sum to be spent on variables. 

It will be noted that the season when these bills of fare were given is one when 
it is difficult to secure much variety. With the advance of spring many articles can be 
procured which add to the variety and relish. 

The following abbreviations are used : 
K— Kelly Hall. 
B— Beecher Hall. 
F — Nancy Foster Hall. 

Ciphers indicate that the cost of the article was charged on the account of a pre- 
vious day.

Table V.— Comparison of a School Dietary with the University of 
Chicago Dietary. 

Several significant and interesting facts are shown by an examination of tlie follow- 
ing comparison of a wholesome and sufficient dietary of a school in Indiana, where 600 
students were boarded at $1.40 per week, with that of the University of Chicago, where 
106 students were boarded at $1.^0 per week. One source of advantage on the side of 
the school is that a much larger number of persons are fed and certain expenses are 
proportionately reduced. In the second place, very little service beside student help 
is furnished at the school, and a large item of expense is thus removed. Another dif- 
ference is seen in the substitution at the school of cheaper foods, such as cereals, veg- 
etables, syrup, and butterine, for meat, milk, cream, fruits, and otlier more expensive 
foods, though the actual amount of nourishment furnished was practically the same in 
both cases.

FOOD AS A FACTOR 



Table VI. — Standard and Actual Dietaries. 

The question arises of how much significance are such computations as to real 
nutrition. In otlier words how much dependence can be put upon calculations of 
nutritive values. It can only be completely answered by many experiments of a char- 
acter similar to the present one, but the results of many investigations in Germany and 
elsewhere have given considerable confidence in certain standards for the average 
person, although it is granted at the outset that there are personal idios}'ncrasies in 
the human animal more often than in the domestic animal, so that only a general 
average dietary can be assumed. From this, however wisely it may be chosen, a few 
individuals will of necessity vary in their needs. 

To the zeal of Professor W. O. Atwater, of Wesleyan University and the Storrs 
Agricultural Experiment Station, is due most of the work in the investigation of foods 
and dietaries which has been done in this country. From his tables are taken the 
following standard dietaries with which the one now reported is compared :

Table VII. — University of Chicago Dietary. 

In order to establish a factor for future calculations, an estimate of actual waste 
was made, which, although far from being as exact as is desirable, is a distinct contri- 
bution to our knowledge. It shows that ten per cent., the usual estimate, is the mini- 
mum amount which must be deducted from the usual dietaries, while the actual amount 
is frequently much larger. 

The per cent, of indigestibility would be in most cases somewhat greater than in 
the present one, since in this case great pains was taken to secure the highest limit 
of digestibility as well as the lowest limit of waste.
