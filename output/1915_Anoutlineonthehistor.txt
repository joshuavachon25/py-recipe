4 TECHNICAL EOT/CATION BULLETIN 

II. All of these processes are dependent on stage of advance in civil- 
ization. 

III. All pass through successive stages, as do all other processes, from 

extremely simple to extremely complex. 

IV. There is no possibility of hard-and-fast chronology, as we find 

extremely complex stage of civilization existing side by side with, 
and exerting strong influence upon, extremely simple stage, e.g., 
Rome and Britain at time of Caesars; America and Philippines. 

V. Civilization proceeds in successive waves. The older cultures, each 
in turn, pass through all periods of development from savagery 
through barbarism to civilization ; from simplicity and frugality 
to luxury, extravagance, then to decay, and to a merging with a 
neighboring civilization in early stages of development, e.g., 
Egypt and Persia ; Greece and Rome ; Roman Empire and Franks. 

VI. Question of food is inextricably bound with four other factors in 
civilization : 

1. Climate and geographic limitations. 

2. Shelter. 

3. Production and control of fire. 

4. Utensils. 

FIRE 

I. DISCOVERY. 

1. Legendary. India Vedas ; Phoenicia; Greece Prometheus, 

Hephaestus, Zeus; Persia; Rome Vulcan, Vesta; Scandi- 
navia; Aztecs; American Indians. 

2. Natural sources. 

a. Lightning setting fire to vegetation. 

b. Sparks struck in working flints. 

II. CONTROL. 

Preservation of fire kindled naturally. 
Artificial kindling. 

Friction of two pieces of dry wood; fire-drill later develop- 
ment of this process. 

b. Striking of flints to produce spark; quartz and pyrites used 

in certain localities. 

c. Burning glass much later development. 

III. FIRE-PLACES. 

1. Open fire on ground. 

2. Rude fire-place of stones piled together. 

3. Dug-out pit lined with stones. 

4. Fire-places in caves; near opening, with outlet for smoke and 

draft. 



AN OUTLINE ON THE HISTORY OF COOKERY 5 

5. Artificial containers, as early forms of braziers; examples in 

Egyptian paintings, in Persian reliefs, descriptions in Homeric 
poems ; used in China and Orient to-day. 

6. Artificial structure, of stones fitted carefully together, with chim- 

ney for draft. All architecture begins with shelter of fire 
from wind and rain. 

TOOLS AND UTENSILS 

All tools imitations of forms found in nature as bowl, from hollow 
stone; knife from flint splinter; spoon from shell; forked instrument 
from forked stick, or human hand, or claw of bird ; hammer from human 
fist. 

I. CONTAINERS : Hollowed stone, natural or artificial ; hollowed wood, 
stumps, ends of logs ; gourds for dippers ; shells for ladles or 
spoons; skin bottles and jars; nets and baskets of fibre and reed; 
baskets daubed with clay for fire-proofing; clay pottery; metal 
bowls and vessels. 

II. BREAKERS : Rude natural core of stone, fitting hand, used as mallet ; 
grooved to fit handle of wood or stone; chipped on edge for 
cutting and scraping; knife with handle; spear; arrow-head. 

III. WEAPONS : Mallet ; knife ; adze ; spear and shield ; bow and arrow. 

IV. DOMESTIC TOOLS : Knife ; scraper ; hand-plow ; mortar and pestle ; 

rolling mill ; quern or rotary mill ; washboard and rubber ; spoons 
of shell; forks. Bone and ivory needles and pins, combs, hair- 
pins, files, small jars, ornaments of all kinds. 



PREHISTORIC TIMES 

I. PREHISTORIC MAN. 

1. Remains of man found in "River-drift" period in England and on 

continent indicate no use of tools, nor knowledge of fire. 
Earlier stage of development than found in any known sav- 
ages in historic times. 

2. EARLY STONE- AGE MAN (Paleolithic). To this age belong 

"kitchen-middens" of Denmark, Scandinavia, many cave- 
remains of France, Spain, and England. Name derived from 
rude stone implements. 

a. Fire known and under partial control could be preserved 

when naturally kindled. 

b. Food. Mainly vegetable; animals occasionally slain included 

shell-fish, insects, etc. Most food eaten raw. No domes- 
ticated animals save dog; no cultivated plants. Food 
supply wholly that of nature. 



O TECHNICAL EDUCATION BULLETIN 

c. Industries. Fishing, some hunting, making of utensils of stone 
and bone ; rude flaked flints chipped to shape, never ground 
or polished ; some spirited drawings as decorations on 
walls of cave-shelters and on implements. 

3. LATE STONE- AGE MAN (Neolithic). To this period belong the 

numerous burial monuments, houses, barrows, graves, mono- 
liths, so common throughout the world. The remains of the 
pile-dwellings, or lake-dwellings, of Switzerland, Ireland, etc., 
probably belong to this period. 

a. Fire under pretty complete control. Can be artificially 

kindled as well as controlled. Used not only for warmth, 
but for cooking food. 

b. Food, both vegetable and animal, prepared by cooking; 

obtained by hunting, fishing, stock-breeding and tillage. 
Nearly all food-animals domesticated, many grains, vege- 
tables and fruits cultivated. 

c. Industries : Spinning, weaving, mining, agriculture, stock- 

raising, making of polished stone implements of many 
types, making of pottery, stone-cutting on large scale. 

4. BRONZE OR METAL-AGE MAN. This period grows out of the pre- 

ceding so gradually that everywhere there is evidence of 
overlapping. With the Iron-Age, which is the outgrowth of 
the Bronze-Age, we come to historic times. This was the 
period of development of the Homeric heroes. 

II. STAGES OF CIVILIZATION. 

There are three recognized steps in development from rudest sav- 
agery to civilization ; these are : 

1. SAVAGERY. 

a. Lowest stage : food consists of fruit, roots, nuts ; since there 

is no knowledge of fire or use of artificially produced 
tools, it is all eaten raw. 

b. Middle stage : in addition to above, food is shellfish, including 

crabs, molluscs; sea slugs; fish; wild animals caught in 
chase. Fire is known and used. Weapons are invented. 

c. Higher stage : invention of bow and arrow makes animal food 

staple ; hunting normal occupation. Control of food pro- 
duction, storage of surplus in settled places, make supply 
less uncertain. Industries are making of wooden and 
stone vessels, hand-weaving of rough fibres for fishing 
nets, reed baskets for cookery, but as yet no making of 
pottery. 

2. BARBARISM. Marked from preceding by invention of pottery. 

Discovery at first probably accidental, through action of heat 
on mud or clay daubed on outside of basket in cooking, or 
through coating food with clay (as fish or bird) before 
baking in ashes. 



AN OUTLINE ON THE HISTORY OF COOKERY 7 

a. Early stage: use of pottery, domestication of animals and 

first cultivation of cereals. 

b. Middle stage : cultivation and irrigation of plants and cereals, 

taming and breeding of animals for both flesh and milk; 
life of herdsman the common one. Use of bronze metal 
for tools and for ornament. 

c. Higher stage : begins with melting of iron-ore. Iron plow, 

drawn by animals, revolutionizes production of vegetable 
foods ; ship-building widens intercourse and equalizes dis- 
tribution of food. This is the stage reached by the 
Egyptians at the time of their earliest records, by the 
Greeks in the Homeric legends, by the Germans as recorded 
by Tacitus, and by the Incas at the time of the conquest 
of Peru. From this stage barbarism merges into civil- 
ization. 

III. FOOD. STAGF.S OF COOKERY. 

1. Stages of preparation of cereals. 

a. Eaten raw and whole. 

b. Ground into meal, eaten raw or dried in sun. 

c. Parched before open blaze. 

d. Roasted or baked in pits with heated stones. 

e. As mush or gruel. 

f. As thin griddle cakes baked on hot surface. 

g. Boiled in a pot (after invention of pottery), at first by 

dropping red hot stones into the water, later by placing 
pot itself directly over flame. 

2. Stages of preparation of meats. Little meat eaten until use of 

fire is well established. 

a. Carcass thrown directly on fire. 

b. Meat roasted on stick over flame of fire; from this spit was 

developed. 

c. Buried in leaves in embers. 

d. Daubed in mud or clay, buried in embers. 

e. Boiled in skin of animal made into rude vessel, or simply 

used to line cavity in rock or earth. Cooking by means 
of stones heated red-hot and dropped into water. 

f. Pot of soapstone or steatite, which could be propped on 

smaller stones and have fire directly beneath. From this, 
legs of pots were developed. 

g. Pottery vessels, set directly on fire. 

3. Food supply of uncivilized man. 

a. Vegetable: corn, rice, cereals, maize, acorns, nuts, dates, figs, 
cocoanuts, lichens, wild celery, service berry, olive, grape, 
apple, cherry, squash and potato in America, sunflower 
seed, chili. 



5 TECHNICAL EDUCATION BULLETIN 

b. Animal: fish, both fresh and salt; all shellfish, oysters and 
mussels especially; birds, both game and fowl; animals, 
domesticated and wild. From these, milk products, espec- 
ially cheese and butter. 

IV. FOLKLORE. 

1. Legends of fire in every mythology: Persian, Hindoo, Chinese, 

Greek, Scandinavian, American Indian. 

2. Taboos of foods and ways of preparation, usually embodied in 

religious practices, i.e., Mosaic code; Code of Manu; Greek 
rites. 

3. Traditions of divine gifts of foods : Asia, rice ; Greece, olive ; 

America, maize; etc. 

REFERENCES : Aesop's Fables ; Apocrypha ; Arabian Nights Entertain- 
ment; Confucius; Herodotus; Koran; Mythology of Greeks, Romans, 
Scandinavians ; Talmud ; Vedas.

PERSIA. 

Rise of Persia contemporary with Greece. Conquered Babylonia, 
reigned as mistress of East till conquered in 5th century B. c. by Greece. 



AN OUTLINE ON THE HISTORY OF COOKERY 13 

I.\ Wonderfully fruitful country reputed seat of Garden of Eden. 
N Climate semi-tropical, many fruit-trees native to soil. 

II. Early history shows greatest moderation and simplicity of living. 

1. Food largely vegetable, fruits abounding, rice a staple. 

2. Flesh food of secondary importance in diet to milk and cheese, 

which form a large part of food of people. 

3. Preparation marked by simplicity, as shown both by records and 

by simplicity of utensils. Little variety in kinds of dishes 
and utensils, though there is elaborate ornamentation. 

4. Contrast with food-habits of Egypt and Babylonia, and their 

luxuries, shown in story of Ochus (Table Traits, p. 306). 

III. Later, Persian living gradually becomes more luxurious, as shown by 

1. Records of great feasts as feast of Ahasuerus in Book of Esther. 

2. Remains of great banquet halls, as that of Darius at Persepolis, 

Cyrus at Susa. 

3. Sculptured records of table-scenes. 

IV. Influence of foreign trade upon food of Persia, 
r. Introduction of new foods. 

a. Melon from India. 

b. Plums and cherries from Africa. 

c. Spices and condiments from Arabia. 

2. More elaborate methods of cookery, by contact with highly 
developed Egyptian and Babylonian cookery. 

V. Persian luxury, unlike that of Greece, Rome, and barbarian Europe, 
consisted in skill of preparation and delicacy of flavor rather 
than in profusion of viands and magnificence of mere bulk. 

VI. With conquest by Greece, Persian wealth declines, civilization decays. 
Country to-day differs little in food-stuffs and food-preparation 
from Persia of 600 B. c. 



GREECE. 

I. HOMERIC TIMES. Stage of civilization, higher barbarism life of 
men, husbandry, cattle-raising, fighting; life of women, care of 
household, spinning and weaving, care, storage and preparation of 
food. 
i. Flesh food. 

a. Cattle, sheep, goats, swine. 

b. Roasted on spits over flame of fire mention of spits large 

enough to support carcass of an ox, turned by hand. 

c. Fat of animals and marrow of bones esteemed delicacies. 

d. Fish held in contempt, eaten only when nothing else was 

obtainable ; fishing by nets, harpoons, hooks mentioned. 



14 TECHNICAL EDUCATION BULLETIN 

e. Homeric heroes did their own cooking skill of several in 
special fields mentioned. 

2. Vegetables and grains. 

a. Bread stuffs barley, meal, and wheaten flour, baked into 

loaves, without leaven.

3. Beverages. 

a. Wine only drink, mixed with water. 

b. Milk not esteemed Polyphemus, type of savage, only user. 

c. Honey sometimes mixed with wine for sweetening.

II. POST-HOMERIC PERIOD, three main centres: 

1. Sparta, noted for frugality. 

a. Public table for men ; common contributions to general 

stock; levy of certain amount per diem. 

b. Light meat diet ; staples, barley meal, cheese, black broth, 

dried figs, and dates; moderate use of wine. 

2. Athens, frugal also allowance of about fifty cents a day for 

four adults considered extravagant. 

a. Meat, usually obtained from sacrifices or public festivities. 

Whole meat diet regarded as a hardship. Sausage and 
fish esteemed. 

b. Vegetables, cereals, fruits cultivated extensively beans and 

peas, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, radishes, onions, leeks, 
turnips ; pease porridge staple in diet. Figs, olives, raisin 
and wine grapes, apples, pears, quinces, pomegranates;

Claudius, Vitellius. 

2. Articles brought from great distances and noted for their rarity 

and costliness. See Good Cheer, p. 57. 

3. Gluttony rather than epicureanism the custom of the time.

II. NORMAN ENGLAND. 

i. Foods. 

a. Greater refinement at once came in with the more cultured 

Normans. Cookery for first time in England regarded as 
an art. Flavor and delicacy more esteemed than mere 
quantity, as among Saxons. With this period comes 
influence of Crusades, with its importation of Eastern 
fruits, as citron, cloves, lemons, oranges, figs, and dates, 
and its spices for preserving meats through winter. 
Norman nobles brought their own stewards and cooks, 
and these positions became posts of honor in household. 

b. Drinks. Upper classes used wines almost entirely; despised 

beer, ale and mead, which continued to be beverages of

CHINA 

A vast country, shut off from rest of civilization both by natural 
barriers and by temper of people themselves. Its civilization goes back to 
3000 B. c. In itself and apparently independent of any surrounding civil- 
ization, China passes through all the stages outlined from simple brute 
existence to the most complex social organization and development. It 
had, however, almost no influence on other peoples, because of its isolation. 
Therefore its food customs are considered with those of modern times, 
for it is only in our own day that they have become familiar. 

FOOD PRODUCTS. 

1. Animal. Fish of all kinds, shellfish, sea-snails, eels, shark-fins, 

sea slugs. Beef not used as food, mutton esteemed, pork 
used freely, deer and antelope used. Fowl or game birds 
regarded as delicacy. Dogs, rats, moles, used for food. 
Eggs staple of diet.

celery, bamboo shoots; nuts, fruits, oranges, etc., fir cones.

ization as ancient as Persia. Climate ranges from tropical to temperate.

AN OUTLINE ON THE HISTORY OF COOKERY 33 

CHRISTMAS 

In the celebration of the Christmas festival on the 25th of December, 
Christian nations are in reality perpetuating the older pagan feasts which 
marked the period of the winter solstice, the time when the sun begins his 
upward climb in the heavens, the return to light and warmth. From 
earliest times this has been the occasion of revelry, feasting and rejoicing 
among all peoples. Among the Phoenicians it was the feast of Baal, or 
Bel, the Sun God ; among the Romans, the feast of Saturn, or Saturnalia, 
and it is from the customs of this celebration that the masking, mumming, 
or pantomime, so characteristic a part of the Christmas festivities in the 
Old World, is derived. Among our Teutonic ancestors, it was the Feast 
of Odin, and our name of Yule-tide, and the ceremonial of the Yule-log, 
are reminders of these older forms of Druid worship, to mark the turn 
of the year, or the "wheeling" of the sun in the heavens. The canny fathers 
of the church endeavored, in so far as was possible, to make the high-days 
and holy-days of the Christian calendar coincide with the periods of 
traditional celebration among the people, thus making a painless transition. 
And in their successful carrying out of this policy, hosts of customs in no 
way connected with the Christian character of the celebration were trans- 
ferred bodily. Thus mince-pie, a characteristic Christmas dish, is the 
lineal descendant of the old Teutonic "blood-pudding" or sausage, which 
differed from common sausage by being sweetened and having plums 
mixed with it. Not until a comparatively late date was it baked in a 
crust; and indeed plum-pudding and mince pie are first cousins, both 
springing from this famous dish. We may include here, too, the old 
plum-porridge, or pottage, with which the Christmas feast always opened, 
for it belongs with the other two in point of derivation. 

In England, the main dish of the Christmas feast was the boar's head. 
It was prepared by pickling, then roasted, and served on a platter of gold 
or silver, its tusks gilded, a roast apple in its mouth, sprigs of rosemary 
and bay to deck it, and the inevitable mustard to season it. So important 
was its place in the feast that its entrance was preceded by heralds or 
trumpeters, and it was borne in, held aloft by the chief steward himself. 
None meaner in degree than a knight might carve it. The old Oxford 
carol, 

"Caput apri defero," 
was sung as it was borne around the board. 

Another dish in high favor for this feast was the peacock. One can 
only account for the esteem in which this bird was held by the fact of its 
rarity and beauty, for even after all the elaborate preparation and the 
lavish use of good materials to make it palatable (one old recipe calls for 
the flesh of three wethers, tender and good, to make the gravy for a 
single bird), the meat was dry, stringy, and tasteless. The bird was first 
carefully skinned, then stuffed with minced flesh, savory herbs, and a 
dressing of yolks of eggs, then roasted and dressed with the before- 
mentioned gravy. The skin with the plumage was then sewn in place, 
the tail spread to display its full beauty, the beak gilded, and a bit of

cotton soaked in brandy inserted therein. It was borne to the table with 
this ablaze, and only the ladies might bring it in, or carve it and serve it. 
Sometimes it was baked in a pie, and then in serving, the head protruded 
from one end, the full-spread tail from the other. An oath taken upon this 
pie was peculiarly sacred, and knights swore upon it their devotion to the 
lady of their choice. Hence comes the old expression "by cock and pie." 
Swans were sometimes given the place of honor when peacock could not 
be obtained, and brawn and sirloin of beef were other Christmas favorites. 
In France and Spain as well as in England, the oyster occupies a promi- 
nent place at the feast, and a gift of a barrel of oysters is a delicate 
attention from one friend to another. While we find frequent mention 
of venison-pasties, this is not a distinctively Christmas dish in any 
country. 

The Christmas cake is an institution in every land. It is of the 
richest composition the means of the household can afford ; old tradition 
says it should be baked a month before it is to be eaten, and dipped in 
spiced ale or brandy every day for a fortnight. It usually contains fruits 
and nuts, and in the old days was sometimes so huge as to be baked in 
sections, as a single oven could not accommodate it. It was iced and 
built up with sugar devices, much as bride-cakes sometimes are. Some- 
times it was called Twelfth-cake, and then in the baking, a bean, a pea, 
and a clove were put in it. When it was cut, the person to whose portion 
the bean fell was king, she who had the pea was queen, and the clove 
designated the knave. These dignitaries were installed with revelry, and 
ruled till Twelfth Night, being absolute in all commands for their little 
reigns. 

The wassail-bowl was another famous Christmas institution. The 
derivation of the word signifies a health, and in the older days ; before 
wines were common and easily obtainable, it was composed of spiced ale, 
with roasted apples bobbing in it. In later days, mulled wine was its basis. 
It was passed round the board, hot and spicy, and each took a deep draft 
from the common cup. It is not until the sixteenth century that we find 
individual cups used for this drink, for the ceremony of partaking of it 
was in itself of a certain democratic significance. 

Frumenty, a dish of wheat cakes seethed in milk, with pounded 
almonds, was a great standby, served sometimes with venison, sometimes 
as a dish by itself. Geese, capon, pheasant, and carp-tongue pie are all 
mentioned as Christmas dishes. Hares, venison, a fine piece of brawn, 
were all customary Christmas gifts from one householder to another. 
Originally such gifts were made on New Year's Day, and this is still the 
custom in some continental countries. New Year's day marked the 
height of the Roman Saturnalia, and this is but another relic from that 
time. 

Certain games and folk-customs, which with us are associated with 
Hallowe'en, really belong to the Yule celebration. Among these are 
bobbing for apples, and jumping for the cake. This last was a rude sport, 
where a cake, daubed with treacle, was suspended by a string from a

beam in the ceiling, and the contestants, with arms bound behind them, 
jumped and tried to bite the cake. Then there was the Christmas Eve 
blessing of the orchards, where the whole company, after partaking of 
offered the remnants of the cake to the largest apple tree, and sprinkled the 
ground with the wine, thus assuring abundance for the coming year. 

On Christmas morning all the children of the community could go 
from house to house, asking for simnel cakes, and no one would refuse 
them. Their elders made similar calls, but instead of the simnel cakes, 
they were served with "egg-hot," a forerunner of our own "egg-nogg," 
made with cider, and with cakes of pounded almonds, our marzipan. 
Everywhere extravagance of provision, hearty eating and deeper drinking 
were the rule of the day. 

With the Period of the Reformation, and especially with the rise of 
the Puritans in England, all observation of Christmas and of Twelfth- 
night as times of feast and revel was not only frowned on, but forbidden 
both by law and by church authority. But the love of the festival was 
too deeply implanted to be thus uprooted, and with the passing of Crom- 
well, we see the old spirit breaking out again in even wilder rejoicing. 
Our own Puritan ancestors came to America while Christmas was in 
eclipse, and consequently New Englanders kept the day as a fast, till their 
Knickerbocker neighbors had corrupted them. Much of the character of 
the celebration in America to-day is borrowed from our German settlers, 
and dates back only to the middle of the last century.
