PREFACE 

All the receipts embodied in this book have been tested and 
are therefore reliable. They have been gleaned from many 
sources in many lands. Some of them have been recorded 
under the difficulty of translating those foreign idioms which 
correspond to our ** fist of flour,'* '* some butter '* or "as 
much sugar as you think it needs ' ' ; many have been given 
by friends, to whom I here return my thanks ; some are heir- 
looms, handed down by thrifty New England housewives, 
while others come from the old homes of the South ; others still 
have been cut* from newspapers, here and there in the odd 
corners of the world to which my travels have taken me. 

To those who are constantly changing their abode and can- 
not therefore enjoy the conveniences of a settled home, like 
the families of army and navy officers, the suggestions and 
simple remedies of Part II may mean all the difference be- 
tween comfort and discomfort. 

It is the aim of this book to introduce into American house- 
holds some of the toothsome dishes of other lands; and to 
suggest to the American housewife that she make use of the 
best cookery of New England, the South and the West, — for 
the distinctive dishes of these regions should be known and 
enjoyed throughout the land.

Put the terrapin in boiling water for 5 minutes, to loosen 
the skin; then take it out, skin it and replace it in the hot 
water. When the claws are soft it is sufficiently boiled. 

Take it out, and remove the bottom shell first. Cut off 
the head and claws, and take out the gall and sand-bag; 
and then cut up the remainder. Cut up entrails and all, 
about i/^-inch lengths. Be careful to preserve all the juice. 

Put the terrapin meat into a stewpan, and make a dressing 
of flour, yolks of 2 hard-boiled eggs, a third of a pound of 
good butter, salt, red pepper, a small quantity of rich cream 
and a half cup of madeira or good sherry to each terrapin. 

All of the ingredients should be of the best quality. Stew

CURRY 

This, the great dish of the East, originateci in India. Rice, 
any kind of meat, fish, or game may be used ; but the accom- 
paniments or sauces are really what make the dish. 

The rice should be well boiled and served in a separate 
dish. 

Place in a stewpan a pint of finely cut (not chopped) meat, 
one gill of milk, or stock, and to this add soft peppers and two 
teaspoons of curry powder. Let this simmer for 10 or 15 
minutes. This should be served in a separate dish. 

The rice should be put on the plates and the curry later 
over it. 

With this should be served the following: Dried fish, or 
*' Bombay duck" (in America a good substitute for ** Bora- 
bay duck" is dried herring) — sweet, sour, and spiced pickles 
of all kinds, grated cocoanut, finely chopped hard-boiled eggs, 
and chutney sauce. 

The best body for curry is made from chicken, lamb or lob- 
ster. Curry powder, itself, is compounded of turmeric, 
coriander seed, ginger and Cayenne pepper, to which salt, 
cloves, cardamons, pounded cinnamon, onions, garlic and 
scraped cocoanut are added — the latter, **coprath," being 
only the vehicle or body to carry the various other condi- 
ments.

MEATS AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Pepper, 1 teaspoon, 
Thyme, a pinch. 

Work the butter into the bread-crumbs. Add a teaspoon 
of salt, a teaspoon of pepper, and a pinch of thyme. Mix 
these well together and moisten with 2 tablespoons of the oys- 
ter liquor. 

Drain the oysters and stuff the turkey with alternate table- 
spoons of the bread-crumbs and of the oysters. Sew up the 
opening. 

Boil the oyster liquor and skim it; put it into the baking- 
pan hot, and frequently baste the turkey with it, while roast- 
ing. 

Eub the turkey with salt and pepper, and dredge with flour, 
before putting it into the oven. 

TURKEY STUFFING 

Two quarts of stuffing is generally needed for a good-sized 
turkey. The foundation is stale bread, finely crumbled. 
When the crusts are used they should be soaked in water un- 
til they are soft, and then squeezed as dry as possible. To 
this may be added a high seasoning, and at least half a cup- 
ful of melted butter, or other shortening. 

Additions may be made at will, of chopped celery, raw 
oysters, drained and quartered, raw sausage-meat, chopped 
raw veal, boiled chestnuts, chopped or rubbed through a sieve, 
chopped hard-boiled eggs, chopped parsley, and truffles.

Chestnuts, 1 pint, 
Stock, 1 cup,

Onion juice, 1 teaspoon, 

Bread-crumbs, 2 tablespoons. 

Butter, 1 tablespoon, 

Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

Eggs, 2 yolks, 

Grated lemon-peel, Cayenne and black pepper. 

Roast and blanch the chestnuts, boil for about 20 minutes 
in strong chicken or veal stock. Drain, and put through a 
vegetable press, or through a meat-chopper. Add to this, the 
boiled liver of the fowl, a slice of ham, both ground fine. 
Also add the onion juice, bread-crumbs and butter, a pinch 
of grated lemon-peel, the salt, a dash of Cayenne, and a salt- 
spoon of black pepper. 

Moisten all with the yolks of 2 eggs, and use as a stuffing. 
This is a delicious stuffing for turkeys, ducks, or chickens. 

BOILED HAM 

Put the ham in a bucket of tepid water, and let it stand all 
night. In the morning put it into a pot of cold water and 
allow it to come to a simmer — ^not boiling; and let it stew 
thus for 5 hours. When it has boiled until tender, take it 
from the fire, and let it cool in the water in which it has been 
boiled. 

Take off the skin, and rub the ham with bread-crumbs and 
sugar. At intervals sprinkle spots of black pepper; and in 
the center of each spot stick a whole clove. Then let it brown 
in the oven. 

BOILED HAM 

CHAMBERLIN'S METHOD 

Put the ham into a tub of cold water the night before you 
intend to cook it. Place it in the tub with the fleshy part 
downward, and the skin partly up. 

Next morning put it into a large kettle or pot, with cold 

76 



AROUNDTHE-WORLD COOK BOOK MEATS 

water, to boil. Let the water get hot gradually, and continue 
to cook the ham in a slow boil, scarcely more than a simmer. 
At the end of 5 hours take it out of the pot, and fill the pot 
with fresh cold water, then put back at once, and let it sim- 
mer 5 hours more. Add, according to your purse, a gallon 
of vinegar, claret, or champagne. 

Simmer 3 hours longer. Take it ofi:*, and put it in a cool 
place. In the morning trim it neatly before serving. 

To prevent the ham from tearing, or the water from sud- 
denly boiling too fast, it is best to sew a piece of cotton cloth 
tightly around the ham, so as to fit it closely. This will 
keep the meat firm, and guard against the neglect of the cook, 
in letting the water boil too fast.

Ham, 
Mustard,

Stock (pigeon), 1 pint. 
Minced parsley, 1 teaspoon, 
Onion juice, 1 teaspoon, 
77 



MEATS AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Eggs, 2, 

Salt and pepper. 

Line a deep dish with pie crust, and place it in the oven to 
bake. Stew the pigeons until tender, then remove the meat 
as whole as possible from the bones. 

Drop 12 clams and 12 oysters into the pigeon stock, and 
stew until the edges curl; then remove them and chop them 
coarsely. 

Boil the pigeon stock down, until it is only 1 pint, then add 
to it the butter, flour, onion juice, and parsley. 

Place the pigeons, clams, and oysters in the crust. Pour 
the hot pigeon stock over 2 beaten eggs, stirring constantly 
to prevent coagulation; then pour this over the pigeons, and 
cover with the top crust. 

Place it in the oven, and bake until it is a light brown. 

BRAISED BEEF HEART 

The beef heart should be first thoroughly washed, running 
a knife well down into the cavities, and cutting through the 
adjacent walls, that all blood-clots may be removed. Trim 
off the rough *^ear" at the top, and dry on a cloth. 

Make a savory stuffing with equal parts of sausage meat 
and fine stale bread-crumbs; adding a large spoonful or more 
of finely chopped parsley. Fill all the cavities with this, 
and if any of the stuffing remains, roll it into small balls and 
place them together with the beef heart into a shallow greased 
pan. 

Fasten the top of the heart with a couple of stitches or 
skewers. Then brown the entire outside of the heart in a 
spoonful or two of hot fat in the pan. 

Transfer to a deep earthen casserole, or baking-dish hav- 
ing a tightly fitting cover, laying it in, with the point down- 
ward. Pour round it a scant pint of either a thin tomato- or 

78 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK MEATS 

savory "brown sauce. Lacking either of these, use soup-stock, 
or plain boiling water — these variations giving different re- 
sults in the flavor of the finished dish. 

Cover the casserole or dish closely and place in a moderate 
oven for 4 hours. When an earthen dish is used, the evapora- 
tion will be less than wnth a metal one, the latter usually neces- 
sitating the addition of more sauce during the cooking. 

It is well to have an extra amount of the sauce, that there 
may be sufficient to fill the gravy-boat. 

With this meat a dish of spiced or pickled peaches, or a tart 
jelly, will harmonize admirably. 

Pork tender-loin may be prepared and braised in the same 
manner. 

BAKED LIVEE 

Take one calf's liver; wash and wipe it dry. Lard it with 
strips of pork. Dredge flour over it, salt it, and bake for half 
an 'iour in a hot oven. 

BAKED CALF'S LIVER 

Wipe the liver and cut into 1-inch cubes. Sprinkle it with 
salt and pepper, cover with thin slices of lemon and sprigs of

ter until well browned on both sides, turning frequently. 

Serve with slices of lemon.

KIDNEYS AND BACON 

Cut the kidneys in halves, lengthwise, remove all the fat, 
and skin them. Wash them and lay them in cold water for 
half an hour and then cut them crosswise, in thin slices. 

Slice the bacon thin, and cut each slice into 2 pieces. Place 
a piece of bacon on a skewer, then a piece of kidney, and thus 
alternate them until you have 5 pieces of each on a skewer. 
Dip the pieces of kidney into melted butter before they are 
put on the skewer. 

Place the skewer on a broiler and hold it over a bright fire, 
turning frequently until all sides are cooked. When the kid- 
neys are broiled, place each skewer on a finger of toast and 
sprinkle lightly with pepper. Put a tiny bit of butter on 
each piece of kidney and serve immediately.

When properly boiled, the grains of rice should each one 
be perfect, and stand apart. The following method will en- 
sure this result: 

Pick over, and wash 1 cup of raw rice, rubbing it hard, 
and changing the water until it runs off clear, and then drain. 

Have fully 4 quarts of water boiling rapidly in the kettle. 
Add the rice, and a half-teaspoon of salt, and cover until 
it boils again, then uncover, or it will boil over. Keep the 
water at a galloping boil. In 10 minutes begin to test, lifting 
out a few grains with a fork, and rubbing them between the 
thumb and finger. 

When tender to the center, which will take about 20 min- 
utes, the rice is done. 

Turn it into a colander, cover it with a cloth, and let it 
steam in the oven for 5 or 10 minutes.

MACARONI 

The wholesome, nourishing qualities of macaroni have never 
been fully appreciated by the average housewife. As a nour- 
ishing food it offers much the same nutrition as white bread; 
but unless it is eaten to excess it is less apt to cause indiges- 
tion than the so-called staff of life. 

Its flavor depends largely upon the manner in which it is 
cooked ; whether it is offered alone, or in combination with 
some vegetable or meat. 

To prepare macaroni properly, boil it rapidly for 30 min- 
utes, in boiling, salted water. To keep the tubes of the 
macaroni from sticking together, the water must be kept at 
a galloping boil, as with rice. 

When it is done, it should be turned into a colander, and 
thoroughly rinsed under the cold-water tap, to remove the 
loose, pasty starch on the outside of the tubes. After drain- 
ing it can be creamed, or finished in any desired way. 

Each nation has a different way of preparing macaroni. 
Here are a number of desirable receipts:

VEGETABLES 

Great difference in result may be obtained in cooking vege- 
tables, according to the method employed in preparing them. 

When cooking such vegetables as cabbage, sprouts, sea- 
kale, lettuce, spinach, cauliflower, etc., they should be 
*' blanched,*' by either soaking in hot water for from 10 to 
15 minutes, or scalded by a short but rapid boiling. This 
is in some cases for the purpose of whitening thera, and in 
others for the purpose of making them firmer. 

The best results will be obtained by combining the two 
methods, first soaking the vegetables in salted water for 
from 10 to 15 minutes, and then quickly boiling for 2 minutes 
in fresh water. Next drain as completely as possible, and 
then cook in fresh water, to which, in the case of such vege- 
tables as spinach, etc., where it is desired to preserve the 
color of the greens, a pinch of soda has been added. Other- 
wise, as with cauliflower, etc., do not add soda. 

Keep covered while cooking, as this retains the strength 
of the juices. Take care not to overcook, as that is liable to 
make the vegetables too soft, and certainly less tasteful. 
Strain off the water as soon as the vegetables have been 
cooked. Leaving them in the water makes them soggy and 
tasteless. 

After draining, which should be done as completely as 
possible, a little butter, or a spoonful of cream may be 
added, which will moisten and make them more palatable. 
Then place the pot, covered, where it will keep warm until 
required. 

The water drained off should be saved. It has often been 

107 



VEGETABLES AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

remarked that a French family can live upon what an 
American family wastes; or, as some one has more aptly 
stated it, ' * the cook can throw more out of the kitchen window 
with a spoon, than the housekeeper can throw into the cellar 
with a shovel/' 

In France, when vegetables are boiled, the water is not 
thrown away, but is saved, and later used for '*maigre" soups, 
and for stock when cooking other vegetables.

sauce. 

This is enough for 8 or 10 persons. 

CREAMED ONIONS 

Onions, 

Salt and pepper, 

Cream sauce. 

Select onions of medium size. The white variety is milder 
than the red. Peel the onions, cover with boiling water, and 
let them stand 5 minutes, then drain; this makes them less 
rank in flavor. Boil the onions in a saucepan, add a teaspoon 
of salt, barely cover with water, and let them boil slowly until 
tender through and through. 

Unless the onions are very small this will require about 
an hour and a half. 

Serve them with a cream sauce.

EGGS 

OMELETTES 

The omelette, like the pie, can be made of anything which 
''takes kindly to flavoring." Eggs may be combined with 
good results with fish, meat, vegetables, cheese, etc., and the 
variety of sweet omelettes is endless. Sugar, jam or any 
kind of preserves, or fruits, and also rum, can be used in 
combination to make very tasteful omelettes. 

A simple method of making an omelette is to break four 
eggs into a bowl, season with salt and pepper, and beat lightly 
until well broken. Place on a fire, which while glowing is yet 
not too fierce, the omelette pan, and dissolve in it 2 level 
tablespoons of butter — you should always allow half a table- 
spoon of butter for each additional egg you may use. 

Let the butter froth up well, or, as the cooks say, ''fritter 
in the pan.'* When you pour in the egg mixture let it cook 
for a few seconds — not minutes — until a film of cooked egg 
has formed in the bottom of the pan. Then with a flexible 
knife lift the edge of the omelette, and if a puff of steam 
escapes at this point, near the knife, tilt the pan, so as to let 
as much of the egg as is still liquid run under the omelette, 
repeating this process until there is no liquid left. 

Loosen the omelette on all sides, fold it over, slide it from 
the pan onto a platter, and serve at once. 

The above is for a simple omelette. Any omelettes requir- 
ing seasoning should have the seasoning mixed with the eggs 
before they are placed in the omelette pan ; and in case of a 
sweet omelette, in which there is a sauce, filling, or fruit, this 

133 



EGGS AROUND TTTE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

should be placed in the center of the omelette, just before it 
is folded over, and the outside of the omelette dusted with 
sugar. 

The following is a partial list of materials which are suit- 
able for combination with eggs, for making omelettes : 

Fish (cold boiled), ham, chicken, veal, oysters, shrimps, 
onions, lamb, etc., tomatoes, green beans, peas, mushrooms, 
cheese, etc., etc. 

With sweet omelettes : Jams, preserves of any kind, fruits, 
and rum. 

The same combinations may be used with eggs for a scram- 
ble, but while the same results may be obtained as regards 
flavor, the omelette is more attractive, and seems more invit- 
ing. However, eggs scrambled with meats or vegetables may 
be served on toast, and thus make a more finished dish.

ters, beating hard as you gradually add them. 

Pour in the melted butter, and lastly stir in the whites 
lightly. Melt some more butter in a skillet, pour the omelette 
mixture iiito it, and leave over the fire until the omelette is 
set.

SAUCES 

Much of the former superiority of French cookery over 
that of other nationalities was due to their ingenious methods 
of preparing appetizing sauces for their various dishes. 

Some of these sauces are quite simple, and readily made, 
while others are more elaborate, and require more time in 
their preparation. 

Most sauces are made by cooking together equal quantities 
of butter and flour for the body of the sauce, and then add- 
ing a seasoning and a liquid, cooking these together also 
with the thickening, or body, until well corporated. 

White sauces are the simplest, and most frequently used; 
and derive their name from the fact that the flour in the 
thickening is not allowed to color. Milk is always used in 
white sauces, while in brown sauces, stock or gravy is used, 
which also tends to make the sauce a darker color. 

For white sauces the ingredients are, butter, flour and 
milk, in the proportion of 1 tablespoon each of flour and 
butter to half a pint of milk. 

To make a white sauce, first put the milk in a stewpan, 
and let it heat to the scalding point. In another pan put 
the flour and butter, and let them melt, stirring occasionally 
until the flour and butter are well mixed together. Bring 
it to a bubble, and then add the hot milk gradually, and 
stir all together, until the whole is smoothly thickened. Then 
season and set aside and allow it to simmer for a few minutes. 

Brown sauces are made by cooking the butter and flour 
together, constantly stirring all the while to prevent burning, 
but until the flour is well browned. As browned flour does 

143 



SAUCES AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

not have the thickening effect that unbrowned flour has, it is 
necessary to use a heaping tablespoon of flour to a tablespoon 
of butter and half a pint of the gravy or stock used as a 
liquid. 

*'Piquante'* sauces are those which contain vinegar in some 
form. For example, a tablespoon of vinegar added to finely 
chopped pickles makes a *'poivrade'' sauce, and this, or finely 
chopped pickles with mustard are good sauces to serve with 
pork chops or with mutton cutlets. 

Various other sauces, most of which start with either a 
white or a brown sauce, derive their names from the manner 
in which they are prepared, or the ingredients which they 
contain. 

When milk cannot be had for a white sauce, water may be 
used instead, in which case the sauce becomes known as a 
drawn-butter sauce. Using cream instead of milk, makes a 
cream sauce; while a bechamel sauce is composed of equal 
parts of cream, and either chicken stock, or veal stock. 

Breaking the yolks of eggs into a white sauce makes it a 
**polette'*; while a good sauce for fish is made by adding to 
a white sauce, either a few chopped oysters, or hard-boiled 
eggs, or capers, or chopped parsley. Capers added to white 
sauce makes a good sauce for boiled mutton. Chopped mush- 
rooms added to white or brown sauce, makes a mushroom 
sauce. An olive sauce is made by adding chopped olives to 
a brown sauce; etc., etc. 

In making sauces do not simply stir the flour and butter 
into an already hot liquid, but first combine the flour and 
butter together, and then add the hot liquid, gradually to 
the mixture. This prevents the sauce from being lumpy.

SALADS 

Salads are economical dishes, and in many cases furnish 
opportunity to utilize remnants, or ''left-overs" of cold 
cooked meats, fish and vegetables, where these have flavors 
which will harmonize. 

The different foods should be kept apart until about to 
make the salad. All raw greens, such as lettuce, cabbage, 
etc., should be well washed in clear cold water to make them 
crisp, then dried on a cloth. Remove all bone, gristle and fat 
from the meats, and flake cold fish into fine bits. Vegetables 
should not be chopped fine, but diced with a sharp knife. 
All green vegetables, and some other vegetables, are much 
improved if they are marinated, or sprinkled with French 
dressing and allowed to remain an hour before preparing the 
salad. 

Vegetable salads may be made of lettuce, cauliflower, green 
string beans, celery, cold boiled potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes, 
cabbage, etc. Nuts may be also used with almost any vege- 
table or fruit combination. 

Lettuce, celery, cabbage, etc., should be placed in cold 
water to make crisp. Asparagus should be boiled, then 
cooled, cut into small lengths, and the tougher parts of the 
stalks removed, then served with mayonnaise or with French 
dressing. 

Cold boiled potatoes cut in dice, may be used, flavored 
with onion or with parsley, and served with either a French 
dressing or with mayonnaise. Potatoes may also be combined 
with other vegetables such as beets, beans, peas, carrots, and 
green peppers. Vegetable salads are particularly appro- 
priate to serve at luncheon with cold meats. 

158 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK SALADS 

Cold boiled cauliflower, the flowers picked apart, and the 
tender parts of the stems cut in small pieces, mixed with 
olives or tomatoes, may be served with mayonnaise or with 
French dressing. 

Cabbage, white, raw and tender, cut in fine strips, and 
mixed with celery, or with strips of green pepper, is served 
with either French dressing or with mayonnaise. 

Cooked green beans, cut in 2-inch lengths, flavored with 
finely chopped onion, and put on lettuce leaves, may be 
served with French dressing. 

Young dandelion, mixed with either lettuce leaves or with 
watercress, may be served with a French dressing. 

Tomatoes, raw, should have the skins removed, then either 
sliced, or served whole. If sliced, add onion and green pep- 
pers and serve with a French or a mayonnaise dressing ; but 
if served whole, the tomatoes should have a filling of celery, 
nuts, vegetables or fish, and should always have a mayonnaise 
dressing. 

CHEESE BALLS 

Grated cheese, 1 cup, 
Whites of eggs, 2, 
Worcestershire, % teaspoon, 
Salt, bread-crumbs. 

Beat the eggs well, mix all the ingredients together, and

salt, rub in the butter and roll out thin, using enough milk to 
make it roll. Sprinkle thickly with the cheese, a dash of 
cayenne, and cut in strips, and bake in the oven till brown. 

SALAD DRESSINGS 

Dressings for salads are both cooked and raw. The 
simplest uncooked dressing is called a French dressing. An- 
other well-known dressing is called a mayonnaise. 

A cooked dressing may be made with cream, eggs, or but- 
ter, for those who do not care for the taste of oil. 

FRENCH DRESSING, NO, 1 ' 

Oil, 4 tablespoons, 
Vinegar, 1 tablespoon, 
Salt, % teaspoon, 
Pepper, 14 teaspoon. 

Put the salt, pepper, and oil in a bowl, and mix well by 
stirring ; add slowly the vinegar, and stir vigorously, and con- 
tinue to stir it until the mixture looks slightly grayish, which 
is the sign that the vinegar and oil are blended. 

This dressing should be used at once, for the ingredients 
will soon separate.

slowly and when well blended together, last add the Worcester- 
shire, and stir it well in. 

160 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK SALADS 

It may be well to state here that a bit of ice put into the 
oil and vinegar for a French dressing results in its being 
surprisingly thickened and remaining the consistency of 
cream for some time. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING, NO. 1 

Eggs, 2 yolks, 
Olive oil, 1 pint, 
Vinegar, 4 tablespoons.

Beat the yolks and put them in a bowl with the mustard 
and the dash of cayenne. Mix well together; and add, 
slowly, drop by drop, the oil. When the mixture is well 
beaten then add the vinegar, the salt being last put in. 

Much of the success depends on the ingredients being cold ; 
and a silver fork is best to do the beating. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING, NO. 2

mustard. Mix well together, then add the oil, drop by drop, 
stirring constantly. When thick add slowly the vinegar, and 
lastly the salt. 

If the dressing is to be kept for any length of time omit the 
salt until just before putting over the salad. 

The yolk of a hard-boiled egg may be used instead of the 

161 



SALADS AROUND-THE-WOKLD COOK BOOK 

raw egg. Also lemon-juice may be used in place of vinegar. 
To obtain the best results the bowl and the ingredients 
should be cold. When the oil is added to the egg and mus- 
tard, should it curdle, then take another yolk, and to it add 
the mixture and beat until smooth. 

MAYONNAISE WITHOUT OIL 

Butter, 1 tablespoon. 
Vinegar, 3 tablespoons.

cool put it in the ice-box, and when needed pour it over the 
salad.

kinds of fruit. Grape-fruit, orange, pineapple, grapes, or 
cherries make the best mixtures. 

The dressing for such a salad should be made of sugar, 
lemon- juice, sherry, or Madeira wine. Sometimes a little 
grated cocoanut is an improvement. 

Fruit salads should be prepared several hours before re- 
quired, and should be served cold. If vegetables, such as cel- 
ery, or olives, are added to the fruit, the salad may require a 
French dressing.

FLOWER SALADS 

These salads, which are said to be of Japanese origin, make 
very attractive dishes representing different flowers. They 
are rather difficult to make, and should always, after being 
prepared, be placed in the refrigerator until wanted for serv- 
ing, as they are liable to wilt. 

CHRYSANTHEMITM SALAD 

This is made with a bed of lettuce leaves and a hard-boiled 
egg to represent the center of the flower. Peel the egg under 
water, and then cut through the white, lengthwise, in strips, 
leaving a little uncut at the top and bottom to hold the strips 
together. Then wrap in a warm damp cloth till required.' 

Lay small lettuce leaves in a plate, tips outward, so as to 
represent curled leaves; then take the egg, still covered with 
the damp cloth, and press it gently together, endwise, causing 
the strips to open, exposing the yellow. Put the egg in the 

181 



SALADS AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

center of the bed of lettuce, and serve with a French 
dressing. 

LILY SALAD 

This requires cold boiled beets, egg and lettuce leaves. For 
each individual salad make a cornucopia of three or four 
sizes of lettuce leaves, the largest leaf being outside. Tie 
these in a roll, at both ends, and let them remain in a cool 
place for some hours, to set. 

Boil an egg hard, and when cold slice it into several rings. 
Remove all the yellow, and chop it fine, and season it with 
salt and pepper. 

When about to serve, remove the strings, putting one of 
the rings of egg around the base of each cornucopia, to hold 
it in shape. 

Put some of the chopped beets and chopped yellow of egg 
into the cornucopia, and serve with a French dressing. 

POPPY SALAD 

Use red beets, lettuce and hard-boiled eggs. The beets 
should be boiled, cooled in water, skinned and dried. Then 
cut from stem upward, forming petals. Gouge out the inner 
part, leaving half an inch at the bottom, and around the 
inner sides. Fill the space with yellow and white of egg, 
seasoned and chopped. Put in the center of a plate, and gar- 
nish with white lettuce. Serve with French dressing, or with 
mayonnaise. 

EOSE SALAD 

Use white lettuce leaves, celery, and red tomatoes. Wash 
and dry the lettuce, cut the celery into small lengths, shave 
these lengthwise, and place in cold water to curl the shavings. 

182 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK SALADS 

Scald the tomatoes for a few moments, then cool, but do 
not remove the skins. From the stem side of each, remove 
a square plug, taking care to leave 1-8-inch or 1-16-inch below 
the portion removed. Then, commencing at the edges of the 
square, cut through the skin of the tomato, in rose-shaped 
leaves, and roll them backward. 

Fill the square with a Japanese salad dressing, or with 
mayonnaise. Place in the center of a plate on a bed of lettuce 
leaves, and around it, put a circle of the curled celery. 

Chop blanched pecans, or almonds, and sprinkle a teaspoon 
of this like pollen, o-^er the top of the tomato. 

TULIP SALAD 

Use egg and white cabbage. This, like the chrysanthemum, 
has a hard-boiled egg to represent the center of each flower. 

The eggs, hard-boiled, should be put into cold water until 
required, to keep them moist. Shave the cabbage into fine 
threads. 

Thrust a long needle through the center of each egg, and 
draw a coarse thread through, passing it completely around 
the egg, as a girdle. Then from the top, downward, cut 
through the white, making four leaves, ending at the thread. 
Curve these slightly outward, leaving the yolk partly ex- 
posed, then withdraw the thread. 

Season with salt and pepper, and put in the center of a 
salad plate, on a bed of the shaved cabbage, and serve with 
a French dressing, or with mayonnaise.

SANDWICHES 

An almost endless variety of fillings may be suggested for 
sandwiches : Fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs, cheese, fish, meat, 
olives, jams, and preserves, — almost any combination is good 
if well put together. 

The bread should be cut thin and well trimmed. Should 
mayonnaise or French dressing be used, it is not necessary 
to spread the bread with butter. 

The savorj^ sandwiches are appropriate for a luncheon, or 
supper. Sweet or fruit sandwiches seem better for afternoon 
teas. 

Sweet sandwiches are variously made. Either chopped nuts 
or grated cocoanut may be with good results combined with 
jam, jelly, marmalade, preserved ginger, maraschino cherries, 
chopped raisins, figs, or dates. 

The dried fruits are always improved by the addition of 
a little sherry or grape-juice. Cream cheese may also be 
added to either the preserved or the dried fruits. 

The following is a good list of fillings for various sand- 
w^iches : 

Apple and celery — Chopped apples, chopped celery, and grated 
cheese, moistened with French or mayonnaise dressing. 

Baked beans — Beans, tomato catsup, and French dressing. 

Caviare — Caviare made into a paste with fresh lemon-juice.

onnaise.

CAKE 

REMARKS 

Handling cakes — To turn out a cake from a tin without 
breaking, wrap a damp cloth around it for a few moments. 
This will prevent its sticking to the tin. 

Icing cake — Cake icing will not crack when cut, if a little 
thick cream is added to it. Allow 1 teaspoon of cream to 
each white of egg. Before icing a cake, rub the top over 
with flour. This vnW make the icing stick more firmly. If you 
wish the idng to stand up, round the edge of the top, pin 
a band of oiled paper round it before icing. 

Blanching almonds — Put them in a stewpan with enough 
cold water to cover, and bring quickly to a boil. Strain, 
rinse them in cold water, and rub them in a clean cloth. The 
skins will then come off easily. 

Pounding almonds — When pounding almonds add a few 
drops of cold water, or they are liable to oil. Almonds al- 
ready pounded can be bought in tins, or by the pound. In 
any case they need to be stored in tins, as any paper left in 
contact with them absorbs oil.

kind of liquid. Stir often with a metal spoon, or one of agate- 
ware. As the sugar heats it will at first lump, then as it 
grows hotter will gradually melt. 

Do not let the syrup turn darker than weak coffee; and 
in stirring be careful not to allow it to splash on the skin, 
as it makes a painful burn. 

When melted, and pale brown, stir in the nuts, then turn 
out quickly into a flat well-greased pan, resting in cold water. 

Pound out the mixture as thin as possible, and put aside 
in a cold place to harden before breaking the candy into 
pieces.

NOUGAT 

Sweet almonds, 1 pound, 
Loaf sugar, 1 pound. 
Lemons (juice only), 3.

CANDY AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Blanch the almonds, and with a sharp knife split each into 
several parts. Spread them over a large dish and place in a 
slow oven. 

Powder the loaf sugar, and put it in a preserving-pan with- 
out any water at all, and set it on the back of the stove, or 
over a gentle fire and stir with a wooden spoon till the sugar 
is nearly dissolved. 

The almonds should not be allowed to brown in the oven. 
Take them out and mix them with the juice of 3 lemons, and 
put the almonds, a few at a time, into the melted sugar, and 
allow them to simmer until a thick paste is formed, taking 
care to stir hard all the time. 

Prepare a mold or square tin, well greased inside with 
olive-oil, and into it pour the mixture ; smooth it evenly, and 
set it in a cool place to harden ; then cut it into oblong blocks 
with a buttered knife. 

FRENCH FONDANT 

As fondant forms the base for many candies, it is of im- 
portance that in the making of such candies care in making 
the fondant be always exercised. 

Fondant can be used at any time for the foundation of 
candies ; when any of this mixture is left over in candy-making, 
it can be used after the lapse of time. 

The regular formula for making fondant is as follows : 

Granulated sugar, 1 pound, 
Water, % pint, 
Flavoring. 

Place a graniteware or enameled stewpan over the fire — 
not next to the blaze — and stir in the sugar and water, con- 
stantly stirring until all the sugar is dissolved. Then let the 
syrup boil for from 5 to 6 minutes, trying it by dropping a 

262 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK CANDY 

few drops into a glass of cold water. When it will form soft 
balls in the fingers take it from the fire and pour the syrup 
into a large platter that has been cooled in cold water. 

When the syrup begins to thicken and cool, beat it rapidly 
with a wooden spoon. Add any desired flavoring before this 
beating. 

After having beaten until white, knead it with the fingers, 
as kneading dough. This will cause the fondant to become 
smooth and of good consistency, which will enable it to be 
easily shaped to suit one's fancy. 

CHOCOLATE COATING 

Chocolate coating for almonds and creams is made by melt- 
ing sweetened chocolate in a double-boiler. 

Run a thick skewer into each nut, and dip into the melted 
chocolate until thoroughly coated. 

Spread on buttered tins to dry, or on waxed paper. 

CHOCOLATE BONBONS 

Sweetened chocolate, i/^ pound, 
Gum arabic, 1 ounce, 
Confectioner's sugar, 2 ounces. 

The gum arabic should be dissolved in l^A tablespoons of 
hot water. Put the chocolate into a boiler and cook until 
soft, then add the gum arabic, dissolved in water and stir 
till smooth. Add the sugar, mix all together, and then drop 
the chocolate, gradually, from the spout of the sugar-boiler, 
cutting off with a wire, to desirable size. When the candy is 
dry it is ready to eat.

Butter, 1 tablespoon. 

Wash the salt from the butter. Stir the sugar and 1 cup 
of water together, and mix in the cornstarch, or arrowroot, 
and bring to a boil, stirring constantly to induce granulation. 
Boil about 10 minutes, and then add the butter. 

Take from the fire, and beat as you would eggs, until it 
begins to look like granulated cheese. Then put in the vanilla 
extract. Butter your hands well. Make the cream into balls 
about the size of large marbles, and lay them on a greased 
dish. 

During this time the chocolate should have been melted, by 
putting it, grated fine, into a tin pail, or a saucepan, and 
plunging it into another pail, containing boiling water. 

When the chocolate is a black syrup add about two table- 
spoons of the powdered sugar to it, beat it smooth, turn it out 
on a hot dish, and roll the cream balls in it until sufficiently 
coated. 

Lay them on a cold dry dish to dry, taking care that they 
do not touch each other. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS, NO. 2

the sugar and cream, or milk, and return to the stove. After 
it comes to a boil stir in the butter and a large pinch of salt. 

Boil till the mixture forms a very soft ball when dropped 
into cold water. It should have just consistency enough not 
to go to pieces when handled. 

Beat it vigorously, stirring in the vanilla, and when the 
candy has slightly cooled, pour it into buttered pans, and 
when almost set, mark it in squares with a knife.

MAEEONS GLACES 

Fresh chestnuts, 1 quart, 
Butter, 2 teaspoons. 
Lemon-juice, 2 tablespoons. 

Syrup 
Sugar, 2 quarts, 
Vanilla bean, 1-inch length. 

Use freshly gathered chestnuts if possible. Score each nut 
on one side with a sharp knife, then cover them with boiling 
water, cook for 5 minutes, and then drain and dry them. 
Add a teaspoon of butter to each pint of chestnuts, and placing 
them in a pan, shake them over the fire for 5 minutes, which 
will loosen both inner and outer skin and these must now be 
removed together, while the nuts are hot. 

Cover the bared nuts with cold water, adding the 2 table- 
spoons of lemon-juice, and let them stand overnight, when the 
nuts will be firm, and will not break in cooking. 

In the morning drain and let them dry, and then cover them 
with a syrup made of 2 pints of sugar and a cup of water, 
for each pint of nuts used — or in this case, 2 quarts of sugar, 
and 2 cups of water. Cook without boiling for 2 hours, or 
until the nuts look clear. 

Drain off the syrup, taking care not to break the nuts, and 
reduce the syrup by rapid boiling. If the nuts are to be put 
away in syrup, then 5 to 8 minutes* boiling will be enough and 
in this case, when the syrup is cooked down, put back the 
nuts, and add the desired flavoring: This should be, either; 
an inch-length of vanilla bean for each quart of nuts, or, 
the juice and thin rind of one lemon, or, 2 tablespoons of 
maraschino. 

After the flavoring is gently stirred in, pour the nuts and 
the syrup into small glasses, and seal when cold.

PART II 
USEFUL INFORMATION 



CLEANING AND REMOVING STAINS 

JAVELLE WATER 

Javelle water is excellent for removing stains from table 
linen, or other linen, and if carefully used is quite harmless, 
but the bleach is a strong one, and if permitted to stand for 
an instant after the discoloration has disappeared, the ma- 
terial is likely to be weakened, and in a short time a hole will 
appear. 

The water is made as follows : 

Sal -sod a, V2 pound. 
Boiling water, 1 pint, 
Chlorid of lime, 14 pound, 
Boiling water, 1 quart. 

Dissolve the sal-soda in a pint of boiling water, and in a 
separate vessel dissolve the chlorid of lime in a quart of 
boiling water. 

When these two mixtures have dissolved then mingle them, 
and give the compound mixture a thorough stirring and leave 
the liquid to cool; when a clear portion will arise, which 
should be poured off and bottled and tightly corked. The 
bottles containing it should be kept in a dark place. 

To use it, put a little of the bottled liquid into a basin, 
and wet the discolored linen with clear water, then put it 
into the basin containing the bleach. The stain should dis- 
appear in a moment — ^not a minute — and the material then 
at once plunged into clear cold water, and then into another 
supply of cold water, continuing this long enough to check 
any further action of the acid. 

303 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Only that portion of the linen that is stained should be 
wet with the javelle water as near as possible. 

JAVELLE WATER 

SECOND METHOD 

Cold water, 1 gallon, 

Chlorid of lime, 1 pound (1 can), 

Sal-soda (common washing-soda), 4 pounds. 

Place all on the fire and allow it to boil for 10 minutes. 
Take off and cool, and when cool put into bottles, fruit-jars, 
or stone jugs. Keep tightly corked. 

A cup of this liquid in a tub of water will loosen the dirt 
in most soiled clothes, bleaching perfectly. It is also good 
for cleaning greasy cooking-utensils, drain-pipes, etc., and 
for removing all bad odors. 

JAVELLE WATER 

THIRD METHOD 

Chlorid of lime, % pound, 
Sal-soda, 1 pound. 

Put the lime and soda into a wooden pail, pour on boiling 
water till the pail is full, to dissolve the soda. Let it remain 
for some hours, and next day stir it well, strain through a 
cloth and put it into bottles and cork, and keep in the dark. 

For taking out stains, wet the linen with water, and rub 
some of the javelle water on the stain, then rub with washing- 
soap, and roll up tightly, and put it in, to boil. 

OXALIC ACID 

Oxalic acid may be used in the same manner as javelle 
water to remove stains, unless they are very deep-seated. It 
is prepared as follows: 

304 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Crystals of oxalic acid, 2 ounces, 
Water, 1 giU. 

Place the oxalic acid crj'stals in a bottle, add the water, 
and shake frequently until many of the crystals have dis- 
solved, which may not, possibly, be before 12 hours. If the 
crystals are small it may be less. Then strain off the solution, 
1 gill of which put into a gallon of water if the acid is to be 
used for a general bleach for clothes that have been made 
yellow by being long put away. But even in this case the 
clothes must be well wet before being put into the acid bath. 

To use for taking out stains, add a gill of the solution to 
a pint of water, and the spot to be removed is touched with 
it, the same as with javelle water. 

Both javelle water and oxalic acid are poison, and the bot- 
tles should be so labeled. They should not be used if there 
are abrasions on the hands. 

REMOVING STAINS WITH SULPHTm MATCHES 

Very small spots on white linen may be removed by wetting 
the heads of sulphur matches, one after the other, and rub- 
bing them over the discoloration. 

It is the sulphur in the composition which acts as a bleach. 

TO CLEAN DECANTERS OR WATER-BOTTLES 

Mix half a gill of vinegar with a handful of salt, and put 
a little of the liquid in each decanter, and shake well then 
rinse in clear water. Milk bottles should be washed first 
with cold water. 

SOFT SOAP 

Potash, % pound, 
Grease, 1 pound. 
305 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Soak the potash in cold water overnight, and next day boil 
it until the potash dissolves, then while still boiling hot, pour 
it over the grease which has been placed in the receptacle in 
which you intend to keep the soap. 

Every day pour on more boiling water, according to the 
quantity of soap being made, and stir well. 

Twenty-five pounds of grease will make about 1 barrel of 
soap. Pour on a kettle of hot water each day until it comes 
to the right consistency. 

TO EEMOVE SPOTS FROM CLOTHING 

Sometimes the application of soap, ammonia, or gasoline to 
fabrics that have been soiled seems only to make the stains 
more prominent. This is partly because the cleaning agent 
was not suitable to the material. 

No matter whether it is silk, wool, or cotton, there should 
always be a fresh piece of cloth placed underneath, to absorb 
the soiled fluid that soaks through, otherwise the cleaning- 
fluid, laden with dirt, has no place to go, and simply spreads 
over the original place. Several layers of some absorbent ma- 
terial should be used; layers of cheese-cloth are very good for 
this purpose. 

It is also important that the fabric to be cleaned be spread 
out smoothly, so that it may be seen that no dirty ring is 
formed outside the stained portion. To prevent the forma- 
tion of such a ring, the stained portion should be surrounded 
with cornstarch, which will prevent the cleaning-fluid from 
spreading. If there should be a ring formed outside the 
cleaned portion, it may in some cases be removed by holding 
it over the spout of a boiling tea-kettle. 

The absorbent cloth should also be large enough to admit 
of moving the stained spot to a different place, so as not to 
rub in again, the old washed-out dirt. 

Use a piece of old, but clean flannel for wetting and for 

306 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

rubbing; and also have another clean piece for use in drying 
the spot as nearly as possible. 

GREASE SPOTS ON LINEN OR COTTON 

To remove grease spots from linen or cotton, use soap or 
weak lyes, and rub well with glycerin, and wash them out in 
warm water. 

TO REMOVE GREASE SPOTS FROM WOOLENS 

To remove grease spots from woolen goods use soapsuds, 
or ammonia. 

TO REMOVE GREASE SPOTS FROM SILKS 

To remove grease spots from silks, use benzine, ether, mag- 
nesia, chalk, or ammonia. 

TWEED AND SERGE GARMENTS 

For cleaning tweed and serge garments, a mixture of pure 
alcohol and salt is very useful. As much coarse common salt 
should be used as the alcohol will absorb, and the liquid 
should be applied as evenly as possible over the whole spot 
to be cleaned, using a brush to apply it. 

TO REMOVE MILDEW FROM LINEN 

To remove mildew from linen rub the linen well with soap, 
and then add a scraping of fine chalk. Cover well with the 
soap and chalk, and rub it well into the fabric. Put it in 
the air, and as it dries keep moistening it again. After two 
or three applications of the chalk and soap, the mildew will 
disappear. 

Another method of removing mildew is by using chlorid of 
lime. For strong fabrics dissolve 4 tablespoons of dry chlorid 

307 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

of lime in half a pint of water, and let the mildewed article 
lie in this for 15 minutes ; then wring it out gently, and put 
it into weak muriatic acid solution made of 1 part of muriatic 
acid and 4 parts of water. 

For delicate fabrics the above solution of chlorid would be 
too strong, therefore the solution should be made of only 1 
part of chlorid of lime to 12 parts of water, and furthermore 
the fabric should not be allowed to remain in the solution 
longer than 5 minutes. 

IRON-RTJST STAINS 

Iron-rust stains are removed by using cream of tartar. If 
this be sprinkled on the stain and the damaged fabric be 
allowed to remain in the sun for a little while, the spot will 
disappear. If the first application is not entirely successful, 
a second will almost surely remove the stain. 

TO REMOVE INK-SPOTS 

To remove ink-spots from fabrics make a thick paste of milk 
and starch, and spread this on the spots and leave it for 
2 days ; and at the end of that time the spots will be hardly 
visible when the paste has been brushed off. It is, however, 
of use only if the spots are treated soon after they have 
been made. 

TO REMOVE GRASS-STAINS 

Grass-stains may be removed from clothing with common 
cooking-molasses, or with glycerin, by allowing the stained 
cloth to remain for 2 or 3 hours with either of these spread 
over the stained spot, then afterward washing out in luke- 
warm water. If the first application does not entirely remove 
the stain, then apply again. 

308 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 



TO TAKE A SCORCH-MARK OUT OF LINEN 

A scorch-mark on linen, if not too brown, may sometimes 
be removed by moistening the linen with water, and laying 
in the sun. Repeat the moistening two or three times, and 
the mark will disappear. 

TO REMOVE PAINT-STAINS 

Turpentine is generally a very good liquid to use for re- 
moving paint-stains, and in this case it is always well to use 
if possible, the surrounding cornstarch, to prevent the tur- 
pentine from spreading. 

STAINS MADE BY TAR 

Stains made by tar are always best removed by the use of 
turpentine; and the spot should be surrounded with corn- 
starch, to prevent the spreading of the cleanser. 

TO REMOVE COFFEE AND TEA STAINS 

To remove stains of coffee and tea, rub the spots with a 
little borax, and soak for half an hour in cold water; then 
hold the fabric over the mouth of a deep bowl, and pour 
boiling water through the spot. 

Another method of removing coffee stains, is to rub the 
stained portion with pure glycerin. This will remove stains 
of coffee and even of cream, from woolen and other materials. 
The stained place should be afterward well washed with luke- 
warm water, and ironed on the under, or wrong side, until 
dry. 

TO REMOVE BLOOD-SPOTS 

Blood-spots may be removed from the most delicate fabrics 
by dropping cold water quickly over the stains (that is, im- 

309 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

mediately after the blood-spots are made), and then covering 
the place witji a thick layer of common laundry starch, finely 
powdered. When dry, brush off the starch, and it will be 
found that the stains are gone. This remedy, however, is of 
no use unless applied at once. 

KEROSENE FOR WASHING CLOTHES 

The washing of clothes can be made much easier by soaking 
them overnight, especially clothes that are particularly soiled, 
in water to which has been added a tablespoon of kerosene. 
In the morning wring out the clothes, and put them in a 
boiler, to which has been added another tablespoon of kero- 
sene, then rinse through cold water, and hang them out. 

TO REMOVE STAINS OF PEACHES 

To remove peach-stains, place a tablespoon of sulphur on 
a plate, add a few drops of pure alcohol and ignite. Over 
this place a tin funnel, mouth downward, and wet the stain 
and hold over the smaller opening of the funnel, allowing 
the fumes of the sulphur to come in contact with every part 
of the stain. The action is a quick, chemical bleaching, which 
is effective for stains on white goods. Be careful to rinse 
the material immediately, and thoroughly in weak ammonia, 
and then launder as usual. 

TO REMOVE BERRY- OR FRUIT-STAINS FROM THE 

HANDS 

To remove fruit-stains from the hands, use the fumes from 
a few sulphur matches, lighting them one by one, and hold- 
ing the fingers over the fumes. If the stains are large, light 
a bunch at a time.

TO REMOVE ERESH FRUIT-STAINS FROM FABRICS 

To remove fresh fruit-stains from fabrics, first try by pour- 
ing boiling water over them; if this fails, then rub them 
with a half-lemon, dipped into salt, and then wash the gar- 
ment. 

Javelle water will surely take out the stains, but the utmost 
care must be used in using javelle water — or rather in wash- 
ing away every trace of the cleaning-fluid after the stain has 
been removed — else the result will be a hole. 

REMOVING SPOTS ON WOOLEN CLOTH 

Spots on woolen cloth may be removed by using sulphuric 
ether, which should always be applied with a piece of the 
same material as that of the goods being cleaned if possible. 
This method is recommended by a prominent woolen-cloth 
manufacturer 

TO CLEAN IVORY HANDLES OF KNIVES 

Knives which have ivory handles that may have become 
darkened, may be cleaned by rubbing the handles with half 
a lemon, which has been dipped in salt. After treating them 
thus, then wash in warm water, and wipe dry. 

TO CLEAN CHAMOIS GLOVES 

Make a strong lather, put the gloves on the hands, and go 
over all parts of the gloves with this lather, squeezing and 
rubbing as if washing the hands. Rinse them in the same 
manner, always in cold water. Wipe them with a soft linen 
cloth, getting as much of the water out of them as possible, 
while the gloves are still on the hands. 

Dry them, and push them in shape with a glove-stretcher, 
and do not under any circumstances, rub the soap into them.

AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 



TO CLEAN WHITE PLimES 

Cut some soap (white) into small pieces, and put it into 
boiling water, adding a little pearl-ash. When the mixture 
has dissolved put the plumes into it, and draw them through 
the hand till they look clean, then put them into a clean lather, 
and rinse in cold water to which is added a little bit of blue. 

TO WASH FINE LACE 

Sew the lace to a piece of white cotton cloth and wet thor- 
oughly, and rub copiously with naphtha soap. Let it stand 
for several hours — overnight if possible. Gently wash until 
the lace is clean. When dry take carefully from the cloth, 
and pull the lace into shape and pick out the edge; then 
press down on the wrong side laying it on a felt cloth. 

** Brown spots" may be removed from lace or from fine 
embroidery, by repeated soaping and putting in the sun. 

TO RESTORE BLACK LACE 

Water, % cup. 
Borax, 1 teaspoon. 
Alcohol, 1 teaspoon. 

Squeeze the lace through this mixture, then rinse in a cup 
of hot water in which an old kid glove has been boiled. Pull 
out the edges till almost dry, then press for 2 days between 
the leaves of a heavy book. 

Another method is, to lay the lace on a clean smooth board, 
and moisten it all over with a piece of black silk dipped in 
a solution of 1 teaspoon of borax to a pint of warm water. 
Iron it while still damp, covering the lace with a piece of 
cloth, or between sheets of thick brovm paper. 

A method for cleaning black lace is to make a solution of 
2 parts of alcohol and 1 part water, and after soaking the 

312 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

lace in this, dry it in the air, and stiffen with a very thin 
solution of gum arabic. 

TO CLEAN JET PASSEMENTERIE 

To clean jet passementerie, rub it with a cloth or a soft 
brush, dipped in equal parts of alcohol and water, and then 
dry it with a clean cloth. 

TO CLEAN SOILED SILK EMBROIDERY 

To clean soiled silk embroidery use spirits of wine, and 
dip a camel's-hair brush in it and brush the trimming until 
all the dirt is removed. 

HOW TO USE MAGNESIA 

When using magnesia as a cleanser, first dampen the stained 
place, then moisten the magnesia, and rub it vigorously on 
the stain, and allow it to dry thoroughly, when the magnesia 
powder may be easily shaken out. 

TO DRY-CLEAN A RTTO 

Beat the rug till no more dust flies from it, then lay it 
flat on the floor, and spread over it, powdered fuller's earth. 
Rub the powder in with a brush as if you were scouring, 
and then roll the rug up, and leave it for a week before brush- 
ing and beating. When well beaten and swept, take a dishpan 
half full of water, to which add a cup of ammonia, and dip- 
ping a broom into the pan, sweep with the broom, the wrong 
way of the nap. This will leave the rug lookiiig fresh and 
clean. 

TO CLEAN AN OIL-PAINTING 

Take the picture from the frame, and lay it on the table 
face upward. Prepare a bowl of tepid water and go care- 

313 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

fully over the entire surface of the picture using a soft 
sponge. 

Then take a large white potato, peel it, and cut in half, 
and after wiping it off, go over the picture with the smoothly- 
cut part of the potato, while it is still moist from the cutting. 

Do not rub hard, and the dirt will soon begin to soften and 
make a suds, quite black, continue to rub it until all the stains 
and spots disappear, and then carefully wash with the tepid 
water and the sponge. 

Never use soap on an oil-painting. It may clean it, but 
the chemicals in soap do damage. Later, wipe the fly-specks 
and soot off, with tepid water and pearline, using a sponge. 
After it is cleaned and dried, varnish with picture varnish 
applied with a bristle-brush. Spread quickly, and don't go 
over the same place twice. 

TO CLEAN GUT FRAMES 

Beat up the white of an egg^ add to it a pinch of soda, 
and brush this mixture over the frames. Then wash with soft 
water and dry with a white flannel cloth. 

TO CLEAN A MIRROR 

First rub the surface with a rag dipped in a little methylated 
spirit, then sprinkle with a little finely powdered blue. Wipe 
quite clean, and polish with a silk duster. 

TO CLEAN BRASS AND SILVERWARE 

Take half a cup of whiting and fill the cup with cold water ; 
pour this into a bottle, and add 1 ounce of ammonia; shake 
well, before using. Wet a flannel cloth with this, and rub 
the silver or brass.

Ci\JlE OF FURNITURE 

FUHNITTTRE POLISH, NO. 1 

A good furniture polish is easily made as follows: 

Turpentine, 1 tablespoon, 
Vinegar, 1 tablespoon, 
Olive-oil, 2 tablespoons. 

This should always be well shaken just before using. 

FUKNITXTKE POLISH, NO. 2 

Beeswax, 1 ounce, 
Castile soap, i/^ ounce. 
Turpentine, 1 pint. 

Pare the soap and wax, and put them in a qnart bottle 
and add the turpentine. Let it remain for 24 hours, and 
shake the bottle well to mix the ingredients. Next day shake 
it well again, and fill the bottle with water. On the fol- 
lowing day it should be of the consistency of thick cream, 
and is then ready for use. Always just before using shake it 
well. 

CEMENT 

A good cement can be made by mixing powdered rice with 
a little cold water, slowly adding to it boiling water, till the 
right consistency is obtained, then pour into a saucepan, and 
boil it for a minute. 

This paste is almost transparent, and is well adapted for 

315 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

fancy paper-work, for which a strong and colorless cement is 
required. 

CEMENT FOE BROKEN GLASS 

Plaster of Paris, mixed into a paste with white of eggy 
makes a strong cement for mending broken glass or china. 

Another excellent cement is made as follows : Into a small 
bottle press as much isinglass as will fit in; then pour in, by 
degrees, unsweetened gin, which will gradually dissolve the 
isinglass, if the bottle is kept in a warm place. 

CHINESE CEMENT 

Orange shellac (broken small), 4 ounces, 
Rectified spirits, 3 ounces. 

Digest together in a warm place till dissolved, then apply 
to the broken parts and these will adhere so that should the 
article break again it will break in another place. The mix- 
ture should be about the consistency of molasses. It is good 
for mending porcelain, glass, fancy-works, jewelry, etc. 

WATERPROOF GLUE 

Waterproof glue may be made from 3 parts gum shellac, 
and 1 part india rubber; these being dissolved separately, 
in ether, under the influence of heat, and the two solutions 
afterward mixed and kept for a time in a sealed bottle. 

Water, either hot or cold, and most acids and alkalies will 
have no effect on this glue. 

LACQUER FOR TOILET SILVER 

Methylated spirits, 1 pint. 
Shellac, 1 ounce. 

316 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Put the shellac in a bottle and dissolve with the methylated 
spirits, cork the bottle tightly, and let it stand for 24 hours, 
then pour off the clear liquid. 

Heat the metal slightly, and paint the solution over it with 
a carael's-hair brush. Any metal ornament may be lac^^uered 
in the same way. 

A little of this solution may be added with good results 
to the powder ordinarily used to clean silverware. 

PAINTING BEASS-WOKK WITH SHELLAC 

If brass chandeliers, stair rails, and so forth, are painted 
with a coating of shellac, they will long keep their polish. 

While the fixtures are still bright and fresh they should 
be given a coating of white sliellac, such as is used by painters. 
The best quality of shellac should be used, and applied with 
a camers-hair brush. 

In the case of brasswork that is not fresh, it should first 
be thorouglily scoured and polished, and dried with a soft 
cloth, then carefully painted, avoiding too wet a brush, as 
that will make streaks, or look smeary. When properly 
painted with shellac, the beds, chandeliers, etc., will not need 
attention for a long time. 

TO CLEAN TAENISHED SILVER 

Water, 1 gallon, 

Cyanid of potassium (fused), 1 pound. 

This preparation is used by a noted firm of silverware 
manufacturers. The same proportions made in smaller quan- 
tities will be of great use, as the cleaning fluid may be kept 
and used any number of times. 

Dip the silver and leave it entirely covered for 4 or 5 
minutes, then wash off with cold water, then with hot water, 

317 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

soap and sponge, then with cold water again, wipe dry, with 
a soft cloth, and polish with chamois and jeweler's rouge. 

TO CLEAN ALUMINUM 

Dissolve 20 grammes of borax in water, and a third as much 
ammonia as you have of water. Shake well together, apply, 
and polish until the white glittering effect is seen that is al- 
ways on new aluminum articles. 

GILDING MIXTURE 

Take equal parts of copal varnish and turpentine, and 
enough Japan drier to give a glisten. Add bronze powder 
enough to bring to the consistency of mucilage and apply 
with a sizing brush. 

TO WRITE ON METALS 

Muriatic acid, 1 ounce, 
Nitric acid, % ounce, 
Beeswax. 

To write on iron, steel, silver or gold, mix the above acids 
and use as follows: Cover the place in which you wish to 
write with melted beeswax, and when the wax is cold, write 
the name^ or words plainly with a file-point, or with an 
etching needle, carrying the writing through the wax, and 
cleaning all the wax out of the letter. 

Then apply the mixed acids with a feather, carefully filling 
all parts of each letter. Let the acid remain for from 1 to 
10 minutes, according to the appearance desired, and then 
put on some water, which will dilute the acid and stop the 
process. 

Either of the acids separately would cut iron or steel, but 
it requires the mixture of the two to take hold of either gold 

318 



AROUND THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

or silver. After the acids are washed off it is well to apply 
a little oil. 

IMITATION OF GROUND GLASS 

In many rooms, especially in apartments, where windows 
or door should have }yoei\ furnished with ^ound ^lass, a 
^'ood imitation of ground glass may \>e made as follows: 

Take a soft piece of putty and tie it closely in a piece of 
clieese-cloth, and pat the plain glass with it until every part 
is covered with a thin white coating. When this covering 
has dried so that it will not rub off, brush the putty over 
with one coat of white varnish. The window may then be 
cleaned like a pane of plain glass. 

TO CLEAN SPOTS FROM MAHOGANY 

Mahogany tables and desks are freipiently disfigured by 
white marks caused by the standing of hot dishes upon them 
without a mat between. To remove the stains, rub on a few 
drops of sweet oil, and afterward polish with a little spirits 
of wine, using a soft cloth. 

PUTTING RODS IN CURTAINS 

When running brass rods through window, or sash curtains, 
put an old glove-finger over the end of the rod that is being 
pushed through the hem. It will prevent the rod from tearing 
the material. 

TO DESTROY SILVER-BUGS 

Oil of pennyroyal, 2 ounces, 
Oil of sassafras, 2 ounces, 
Alcohol, 4 ounces. 

Let it mix well and then sprinkle where the bugs have been 
congregating.

TO RID A CLOSET OF MOTHS 

Place some bricks in the closet, and take a tin or iron pan 
and after having heated the pan red hot, pour into it hot 
vinegar, and placing the pan on the bricks, close the door 
as soon as the vinegar commences to hiss on the heated sur- 
face of the pan, and keep the closet-door closed for the re- 
mainder of the day.

CARE OF THE HAIR 

FALLING HAIR 

Glycerin, Vli ounce, 
Eau de Cologne, 14 pint, 
Liquid ammonia, 1 dram. 
Oil of rosemary, Vi dram, 
Oil of organum, Vj dram. 
Tincture of cantharides, 1 ounce. 

Mix and agitate well for 10 minutes. A few drops of es- 
sence of musk, or other perfume, may be added if so desired. 

HAIE TONIC, NO. 1 

Cologne, 8 ounces, 

Tincture of cantharides, 1 ounce. 

Oil of lavender, % dram, 

Oil of rosemary, % dram. 

Apply to the roots of the hair daily. It is necessary that 
the scalp be absolutely clean; shampooing at least once a 
week, while using the tonic. 

BEILLIANTINE FOR THE HAIR 

Brilliantine is used to give the hair a gloss, and to keep 
it smooth. 

Sweet almond oil, 8 fluid oimces, 
Alcohol, 4 fluid ounces, 
321 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Glycerin, 1 fluid ounce, 
Oil of geranium, 12 drops. 

HAIR TONIC, NO. 2 

Phenic acid, 2 grammes. 
Tincture nux vomica, 7 grammes. 
Tincture cinchona rub, 30 grammes, 
Eau de Cologne, 120 grammes. 

This is a good tonic for the hair, and also for removing 
dandruff from the scalp. 

POWDER FOR OILY HAIR 

A powder to clean oily hair is made as follows : 

Powdered orris, 1/4 pound, 
Bergamot rind, 1% drams, 
Cassia flowers, II/2 drains. 
Coarsely ground cloves, i/4 drams. 

Mix all, and put through a sieve. The best way of using 
is to rub into the hair at night, and let it remain until morn- 
ing, then brush it out. This will perfume the hair. 

TO KEEP THE HAIR CURLED 

The following mixture will keep the hair curled : 

Gum arable, 1 ounce. 
Moist sugar, % ounce, 
Hot water, % pint. 
Alcohol, 2 fluid ounces, 
Bichlorid of mercury, 6 grains. 
Sal-ammoniac, 6 grains. 

The mercury and sal-ammoniac should be dissolved in the 
alcohol before mixing with the other ingredients. At the last 

322 



AROUND-THEWORLD COOK BOOK 

add enough water to make the whole mixture measure 1 pint. 

Perfume with colo<2:ne or lavender water. ^loisten the hair 
with the fluid hefore putting it in papers or curlers. 

This is too strong a solution to be applied repeatedly, as 
it would surely have a destructive effect on the hair follicles, 
and for that reason it should not be applied too frequently, 
nor at too short intervals. An occasional use, however, is 
practically harmless. 

EGG SHAMPOO 

A good egg shampoo can be easily made as follows: 

Egg, 1, 

Hot rain-water, 1 pint, 

Spirits of rosemary, 1 ounce. 

Beat the mixture thoroughly and use it warm. Rub it well 
into the scalp, and rinse several times in clear water. 

HENNA AS A STAIN FOR THE HAIR 

Henna is a vegetable stain, quite harmless, and producing 
an attractive reddish tint to the hair. For home use it will 
be found much safer than anything else. 

Shampoo the hair and dry, and then apply the stain of 
henna. 

CAEE OF THE EYEBROWS 

Before brushing the eyebrows rub them with vaseline. 
This will help them to run in the one direction. 

TO GROW HEAVY EYEBROWS 

The following recipe for promoting the growth of the eye- 
brows is very good, and is perfectly harmless: 

323 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Vaseline, 2 ounces, 
Cantharides, % ounce, 
Oil of rosemary, 15 drops. 
Lavender extract, 15 drops. 

Mix thoroughly, and apply to the eyebrows with a tiny 
toothbrush once a day until the growth is sufficiently stim- 
ulated, and then less often. 

This ointment may be used for the eyelashes also, but in 
this case apply carefully, for it will inflame the eyes if it 
gets into them. 

TO DAEKEN THE EYEBEOWS 

Make a strong brew of sage tea, strain it through a muslin, 
and to a pint of the liquid add a tablespoon of alcohol. 
Apply this to the eyebrows with a brush. It is perfectly 
harmless, and will, in fact, stimulate the growth of the eye- 
brows. 

CHINESE EYELASH STAIN 

Gum arable, 1 dram, 
India ink, % dram. 
Rose-water, 4 ounces. 

Powder the ink and gum, and triturate small quantities of 
the powder until there is obtained a uniform black liquid 
in a powder, and then add the rose-water. Be careful not to 
get this stain in the eyes. 



324 



.CAEE OF THE SKIN 

ALMOND MEAL 

Orris-root, powdered, 4 ounces, 

Wheat flour, 4 ounces. 

White Castile soap, powdered, 1 ounce, 

Borax, 1 ounce. 

Oil of bitter almonds, 10 drops. 

Oil of bcri^amot, 2 dranis. 

Tincture of musk, 1 dram. 

Mix well, and pass through a sieve. This should be used 
instead of soap. 

ALMOND MILK 

Jordan almonds, 30, 
Distilled water, % pint, 
Sugar. 

Blanch the almonds, and bruise them to a fine powder, by- 
pounding in a mortar, in which has been placed also the dis- 
tilled water. Add also a lump of sugar, so that the oil will 
not separate from the mixture. 

The almonds should be pounded as finely as possible, and 
it will take some time. When pounded to an impalpable 
powder, then strain through cheese-cloth. 

To make the milk richer, increase the number of almonds 
used with the same quantity of water. The preparation is 
both soothing and bleaching.

THE lEMON BATH 

The lemon bath is a great invigorator, an excellent cleanser, 
and has a most soothing, refreshing, and softening influence 
on the skin. It is prepared as follows: 

Cut five lemons in slices, and leave them to soak in a basin 
of water for half an hour. After the bath-water has been 
drawn from the faucet, the lemon- water should be added and 
the whole vigorously stirred. 

BATH BAGS 

Oatmeal, 4 pounds, 

Bran, 2 quarts. 

Almond meal, II/2 pounds, 

White Castile soap, 1 pound, 

Violet sachet, 3 ounces. 

Have the soap dried and powdered. Mix all together, and 
keep in glass jars, from which to fill small cheese-cloth bags, 
to use as sponges. The bags should be about 4 inches square, 
and filled a^ needed. 

EOUGE 

A simple preparation of rouge is made as follows: 

Carmine, % dram, 

Oil of almonds, 1 dram, 

French chalk, 2 ounces. 

Mix thoroughly, and it will be found that the chalk absorbs 
the oil, making an adhesive powder. One advantage in using 
this rouge is that it does not contain any mercury.

LIP SALVE 

Spermaceti ointment, V2 ounce, 
Balsam of Peru, IY2 grains, 
Alkanet, lYo grains. 
Oil of cloves, 2 drops. 

Mix the alkanet with the spermaceti ointment, in a bottle 
or in a dish, and let it stand over a gentle heat till the liquid 
is rose-colored, then put it through a strainer. When cool, 
stir in the balsam and let it settle. 

When it is clear pour off the liciuid, lea\ing the sediment, 
then add the cloves to the liquid. When it becomes cold, it 
should be hard, but it will not get hard if in the course of 
making it has been subjected to too much heat; therefore, it 
should simply be allowed to get warm. 

COLD CEEAM 

Sweet oil of almonds, 75 grains, 
Virgin wax, 20 grains. 
Spermaceti, 8 grammes. 
Perfume.

AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Melt all together, and stir for 20 minutes, and when cooling 
add any desired perfume. 

ORANGE-FLOWER CREAM 

Oil of sweet almonds, 4 ounces, 

White wax, 6 drams, 

Spermaceti, 6 drams, 

Borax, 2 drams. 

Glycerin, li/^ ounces, 

Oil of neroli, 15 drops. 

Oil of orange-skin (bigarde), 15 drops. 

Melt the sweet almond, wax, and spermaceti, and add to it 
the orange-flower water. Dissolve the borax in the mixture, 
and then pour it slowly into the blended fats, stirring con- 
tinuously. This is a good **food for the skin." 

FOR MOIST HANDS 

Tincture of belladonna, % ounce, 
Eau de Cologne, 3 ounces. 

Mix the two well, and use when desired during the day, 
always washing the hands in hot water and drying them 
quickly just before applying the lotion. Rub it well into 
the skin. 

(Keep this out of the way of children and ignorant per- 
sons.) After having applied the lotion, the hands should 
be rubbed with a little talcum powder. 

ORRIS POWDER FOR PERSPIRATION 

Phenic acid, 3 fluid drams, 
Alcohol, 5% fluid drams. 
Starch, 6% ounces, 
328 



AROUND THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Florentine orris, 51/2 ounces, 
Essence of violet, 32 minims. 

Dissolve the acid in the alcohol, add the violet essence, then 
the starcli, and then the orris. 

TO REMOVE TAN 

Hatho in pure lemon-juioc. First wash the skin thoroughly 
with warm \\'at^r and a pure soap; then after dryin«r thor- 
oufjhly with a soft towel, apply the lemon-juice with a wad 
of absorbent cotton. 

Peroxid of hydrogen, diluted with water and applied in 
the same manner, will also remove tan. 

PEROXID AS A FACE BLEACH 

When using peroxid as a face bleach it should be left on 
the face for an hour or two after it dries. Instead of wash- 
ing it off with water, rub the skin with a good cold cream, 
and the skin will be much smoother and softer. 

TO REMOVE A MOTH-PATCH 

Cocoa-butter, 214 drams, 

Castor oil, 2^/2 drams. 

White precipitate of mercury, l^A grains, 

Essence of rose, 10 drops. 

Apply the mixture to the moth-patch night and morning.

PERFUMES 

COLOGNE 

The following' is a very good' recipe for making cologne : 

Essence of lemon, 10 grammes, 
Essence of cedrat (citron), 10 grammes, 
Essence of bergamot, 10 grammes. 
Essence of fine lavender, 10 grammes, 
Essence of rosemary, 4 grammes. 
Essence of thyme, 2 grammes, 
Alcohol, 2 quarts. 

• Mix the essences with the alcohol, and filter through paper. 

BLENDING OF PEEFTJMES 

In making sachet-bags, the blending of the perfumes is of 
much importance. The two odors that mix most perfectly 
are violet and heliotrope ; and the addition of a little sandal- 
wood to these will produce an exquisite odor. 

Rose and heliotrope blend very sweetly; and lilac and 
violet make a dainty combination. 

A little sandal-wood or orris-root added to almost any com- 
bination of odors will increase the pungency, and make the 
result more lasting. 

SCENT-BAGS 

An old-fashioned filling for scent-bags is made as follows: 

Coriander seed, % pound. 
Powdered orris-root, % pound, 
330 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Aromatic calamus, 14 pound, 
Daraask-rose leaves, i/4 pound, 
Lavender blossoms, 2 ounces, 
Mace, 1/0 ounce. 
Cinnamon, ^4 ounce. 
Cloves, 14 ounce. 
Powdered musk, 2 drams.

VIOLET SACHET-POWDER 

The following is a very good recipe for making a pleasant 
sachet-powder. 

Powdered orris, 1 ounce, 
Powdered bergamot-peel, 1/4 ounce. 
Powdered acacia, V4 ounce. 
Musk, 20 grains. 

Bottle for 10 days, at the end of which time it is ready 
for use. 

ROSE SACHET-POWDER 

Lavender leaves, % pound, 
Dried rose-lpaves, i/4 pound, 
Powdered orris-root, % pound, 
Civet, 8 grains. 
Powdered musk, 10 grains. 

Mix thoroughly and keep air-tight until ready to make up 
into sachets. If the odor of musk is not agreeable it may be 
omitted. 

ROSE SACHET 

Dried rose-leaves, l^ pound, 
Ground sandal-wood, 14 pound, 
Attar of rose, % ounce. 
331 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Keep in a tightly corked bottle when not needed for use 
to fill the bags. 

HELIOTROPE SACHET 

Dried rose-leaves, i/4 pound, 
Powdered orris-root, i/^ pound. 
Powdered tonka bean, 2 ounces. 
Vanilla bean, 1 ounce, 
Attar of almonds, 2 drops. 

Powder all and mix by sifting them together. 

LAVENDER SMELLING-SALTS 

Carbonate of ammonia, 8 ounces, 
Oil of cloves, 1 fluid ounce. 
Oil of lavender, % fluid ounce. 
Oil of bergamot, % fluid ounce, 
Oil of cassia, y^ fluid ounce. 

Crush the ammonia into very small pieces, and put it into 
a smelling-bottle; mix the oils thoroughly, and pour just 
enough into the bottle to barely cover the ammonia, keeping 
the remainder to replenish the smelling-bottle when required. 

TO MAKE POTPOURRI JARS 

"Whole allspice (crushed), 2 ounces. 

Stick cinnamon (broken coarsely), 2 ounces. 

Orris-root (bruised and shredded), 1 ounce, 

Lavender flowers, 2 ounces, 

Oil of rose, 5 drops. 

Good cologne, % piiit, 

Rose petals, 

Salt. 

332 



AROUNDTHE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Gather the rose leaves in the morning and let them stand 
in a cool place to dry. Toss them lightly, then put them in 
a large covered dish in layers. Sprinkle each layer freely 
with salt. 

Add to this several mornings, till enough stock of leaves 
has been gathered. Shake up, or stir every morning, and let 
the whole stand 10 days after the last petals are added. 

Transfer to a glass fruit-jar, in the bottom of which have 
been placed the allspice and cinnamon. Let it stand 6 weeks 
closely covered, when it is then ready for the permanent jar. 

Add to it now the orris, lavender, and a small quantity of 
any other sweet-scented dried leaves that may be desired, and 
mix all together, and put it into the permanent rose-jar, in 
alternate layers; with the rose stock and the few drops of 
Tose-oil, and pour over the whole, the fourth of a pint of 
good strong cologne. 

This will last for years; though from time to time one may 
add a little lavender, or orange-flower water, or any nice 
perfume, and at some seasons, may ev^n add a few more 
fresh rose-petals. 

TO MAKE FOTPOTJERI JARS 

ANOTHER METHOD 

Violet powder, % ounce, 
Orris-root, y^ ounce, 
Mace, y^ teaspoon. 
Rose powder, i/^ ounce. 
Heliotrope jwwder, V2 ounce. 
Cinnamon, y^ teaspoon, 
Cloves, 1/2 teaspoon. 
Oil of roses, 4 drops, 
Oil chiris, 10 drops. 
Oil melissa, 20 drops. 
Oil eucalyptus, 20 drops, 
333 



AROUND-THE- WORLD COOK BOOK 

Bergamot, 10 drops, 
Alcohol, 2 drams. 

Use fresh rose-leaves for the vehicle to hold the powders. 
It is best to gather the leaves when the roses are in their 
richest bloom. Pack them in a jar in layers, about 2 inches 
deep, and sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of fine, dry salt on 
each layer. 

Continue this until the jar is full, adding fresh leaves and 
salt daily, and keep it in a dark, dry, cool place. 

A week after the last layer is gathered, turn out the salted 
petals on a broad platter, mix, and toss together until the 
mass is loosened; then incorporate them thoroughly with the 
formula given above, pack them in a clean permanent jar, 
cover lightly, and set it away to ripen. 

If not in its permanent jar it will be ready for permanent 
jars in a fortnight, and if well-covered will be good and 
fragrant for 25 years, if not longer. 

PERFUMED BEADS 

Old-fashioned perfumed beads are made in the following 
manner : 

Powdered red-rose petals, 4 ounces, 
Carmine, 20 grains. 
Tincture of musk, 1 dram, 
Gum tragacanth. 

Mix all the ingredients together, and add enough of the 
gum tragacanth to mold into spheres; pierce them before 
they are perfectly dry. They can be highly polished, or can 
be incised in various fashions. 



334 



AROUND-TIIE-WORLD COOK BOOK 



ATTAE OF ROSE 

Rose leaves, 
Salt, 
Olive oil. 

Pick enonp:h rose leaves to make a quart when closely pressed 
down. Put a layer of these in a 2-(|uart pjlass fruit-jar, and 
sprinkle lightly with salt, then cover with a thin layer of 
absorbent cotton wet with olive oil. 

Fill the jar with alternate layers in the same manner, and 
put on the rubber cover and set the jar in the sun daily for 
2 weeks or longer, if the weather be cloudy. 

Uncover, and press the oil from the leaves and cotton, and 
place it in very closely corked vials.

SIMPLE EEMEDIES, AND FIEST AIDS 

USES FOR HOT WATER 

In case of colic — Apply to the abdomen a large square of 
house flannel which has been dipped into boiling water and 
wrung out by twisting it in a towel. After twisting or wring- 
ing, the flannel should be given one shake, folded into a light 
soft pad, and applied, and covered with waterproof, or thick 
flannel. 

Headache, or neuralgia — The same kind of application to 
the nape of the neck, and to the forehead, gives great relief, 
no matter to what specific cause the headache may be due. 

Lumbago — Thick flannel wrung out of boiling water will 
also assuage lumbago. When applied for this purpose the 
flannel should be changed every 10 or 15 minutes, having the 
fresh one wrung out and ready to go on, before the other one 
comes off. 

Constipation — This may in many cases be cured without the 
use of drugs, by drinking a hot tumbler of water every night 
before going to bed, and another tumbler, next morning, half 
an hour or so, before breakfast. 

Indigestion — A small tumbler of hot water, drank half an 
hour before dinner, is frequently of great service to sufferers 
from indigestion. The same, taken shortly after meals, is 
often found beneficial. 

Sprains and strains — The very best thing to relieve the pain 
of a sprain is to immediately envelope the injured part in a 
piece of thick flannel which has been wrung out of boiling 
water. 

336 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Fomentations of this kind should be kept up until the pain 
lessens. 

Sleeplessness — Give hot spinal douches — that is, pouring hot 
water down the spine from a jug, or a big sponge. These 
douches are of more value for the cure of sleeplessness than 
sleeping draughts, for they cannot do harm, and in most cases 
soothe the nerves, draw blood from the brain, and induce 
sleep. 

Convulsions — The immediate treatment of convulsions in 
young children is a hot bath — not too hot, remember. You 
should be able to bear your own elbow quite comfortably in 
the water. The elbow is much more sensitive than the hand, 
and can therefore, better test the heat, if a bath thermometer 
be not at hand. If a bath thermometer is obtainable let the 
temperature of water be not over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Ovei-stoutness — The drinking of hot water, combined with a 
diet from which farinaceous foods, sugar, potatoes, and beer 
are eliminated, does much toward reducing a too superabun- 
dant amount of fat. The water should be taken in this man- 
ner: 

Take from % pint to 1 pint in the morning, either in bed, 
or while dressing; and take the same quantity an hour and a 
half before each meal, and half an hour before bedtime. 

The water should not be gulped down, but slowly sipped; 
taking from 5 to 15 minutes to drink — it can be rewarmed 
during the drinking, if necessary. By taking it in this man- 
ner uncomfortable distention is avoided. It is best to begin 
with a smaller quantity, and increase as it is found to agree. 

VEGETABLES AS MEDICIKE 

Asparagus benefits the kidneys. 
Potatoes contain salts and potash. 
French beans and lentils give iron. 

337 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

Celery is good for rheumatism and neuralgia. 

Tomatoes stimulate the healthy action of the liver. 

Lettuce is good for tired nerves, and induces sleep. 

Cabbage, cauliflower, and spinach are beneficial to anemic 
people. 

Food specialists vote spinach as the most precious of vege- 
tables. It contains salts of potassium and much iron. 

It is claimed that carrots form blood, beautify the skin, and 
improve the appetite. 

For that tired feeling that comes in the spring, the best 
vegetables are, parsley, horseradish, mustard, dock, dandelion 
and beet-tops, as they clear the blood, and regulate the system. 

MUSTARD PLASTERS 

To make a mustard plaster take equal parts of mustard and 
flour; stir together with a little warm water, just sufficient to 
make it into a thick paste. Spread it on a piece of linen that 
is large enough to fold over and prevent the paste from touch- 
ing the skin. Apply the plaster to that part of the skin that 
it is desired to irritate. 

Ginger plasters may be made in the same manner, as mus- 
tard plasters, and produce the same results and do not blister. 

CURE FOR SEASICKNESS 

A glass of hot milk with a generous dash of cayenne will 
often cure seasickness. 

SICK HEADACHE 

The juice of half a lemon, in a cup of black coffee, without 
any sugar, has been found to cure a sick headache. 



338 



AROUND THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 



TO CURE A BILIOUS ATTACK 

A strong, unsweetened lemon, taken before breakfast, will 
prevent and will cure a bilious attack. 

GRAPE- AND PINEAPPLE-JUICE 

These are great blessings in the sickroom. Only the jaice 
of either should be swallowed. It allays thirst, and is nourish- 
ing, acting beneficially upon the liver and kidneys. 

FOR SPRAINS 

If the ankle is sprained, rest is all important. Handage the 
part and keep tfiis bandage soaked with water as hot as the 
patient can bear, or with witch-hazel. 

For a sprained wrist, use the same treatment and put the 
arm in a sling. 

FOE NOSE BLEED 

Lay the sufferer on his back, with arms elevated above the 
head, and apply the coldest water obtainable to the nose, fore- 
head, and back of the neck. 

FAINTING 

Lay the patient on his back, and do not raise the head, but 
allow it to remain at the same level as the rest of the body. 
Loosen the collar, and anything tight about the neck and body, 
and apply smelling-salts to the nose, and bathe the face and 
head with cold water, dashing it on. 

When the patient is able to swallow, administer brandy. 
The all-important point is to keep the patient's head low. 

HYSTERICS 

Hysterics may be treated in the same manner as fainting. 

339 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 



HICCOUGHS 

Severe cases demand drastic treatment, such as hot mustard 
plasters laid directly on the pit of the stomach. For milder 
cases cloths dipped in either hot vinegar, brandy, or whisky, 
will sometimes give immediate relief. 

TO STOP THE FLOW OF BLOOD 

In case of an accident when the flow of blood from a wound 
is excessive, an application of equal parts of flour and sugar, 
mixed well, will effectually check the flow until the arrival of 
a physician. 

RELIEF FOR BURNS 

Slight burns and scalds may be relieved by wrapping the 
parts in a soft cloth saturated with a strong solution of borax. 

A dressing of carbolized vaseline, olive-oil, or the white of 
egg, are all excellent to exclude the air from a burn. 

If blisters have formed, they should be opened by pricking, 
and dressed at once, to protect from the air. 

TO REMOVE A SPLINTER 

To extract a splinter from the flesh with but little pain, 
nearly fill a wide-mouthed bottle with hot water, place the in- 
jured part over the mouth of the bottle, and press tightly down. 
The suction will draw the flesh down, and in a minute or two 
the splinter will come out. 

STINGS OF INSECTS 

To relieve the stings of insects apply ammonia, or peroxide 
to the affected part. An old-time cure was as follows : 

Take the sting out with a needle and then with the place 

340 



AROUND-THE-WORLD COOK BOOK 

tightly squeezed, suck, and afterwards apply a liniment of 
powdered chalk and olive-oil to the part. 

FOR BURNING FEET 

Arnica diluted with warm water is soothing for tired and 
burning feet. After the lotion has dried in, rub the feet gen- 
tly, using a good toilet-cream of sweet-almonds. 

Always draw the blood from the ankle or the instep, toward 
the toes. Support the instep or the ball of the foot with the 
left hand, while rubbing with the right ; using the downward 
motion on the outside of the foot, or ankle. A rotary motion 
on the instep is very restful. 

LIME-WATER 

Put a heaping teaspoon of pure slaked lime into 1 quart 
of boiled or distilled water. Cork, and shake several times 
during the first hour. Then let the lime settle, and after 24 
hours pour off the clear liquid. Keep in a dark bottle, and 
well stoppered. 

TOOTH-POWDEK 

The following recipe gives an excellent tooth-powder, easily 
made, and pleasant to use : 

Peruvian bark, % ounce, 
Myrrh, % ounce, 
Powdered Orris-root, i^ ounce, 
Chalk, 1 ounce. 

Flavor very strongly with wintergreen.
