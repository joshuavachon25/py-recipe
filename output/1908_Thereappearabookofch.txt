Of all appeals— although 

I grant the power of pathos and of gold, 
Of beauty, flattery, threats, a shilling— no 

Method's more sure at moments to take hold 
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow 

More tender, as we every day behold, 
Than that all-softening, overpowering knell, 
The Tocsin of the soul— the dinner bell. 

—Byron.

"Would you know how first he met her? 
She was cutting bread and butter." 

—Goethe 



PERPETUAL YEAST-Mrs. Briggs 

A quart preserving can is the most convenient thing to start 
and to keep this yeast in. To begin a can of this perpetual 
yeast, dissolve a compressed yeast cake in a quarter of a cup of 
lukewarm potato water — that is, the water in which the potatoes 
for dinner are cooked. Fill a quart can of glass half full of luke- 
warm potato water. Add half a cup granulated sugar to it, and 
when this is dissolved add the quarter of a cup of dissolved 
yeast. Stir well and set the can containing the yeast in a 
moderately warm place, but not where it will be heated percep- 
tibly, and let it stand until the whole is very light. Seal up the 
can and the day before you are ready to make bread, fill the can 
full of lukewarm potato water and add another half cup of sugar. 
Let the can stand for about twenty-four hours. Beat the foam- 
ing white yeast and use a pint, or half the can, for four small 
or three large loaves of bread. Use as much lukewarm water 
as you do of yeast, and mix the bread at once, kneading it 
thoroughly. Seal up the can of yeast, set it away and a day be- 
fore the yeast is needed fill up the can again with lukewarm 
potato water, in which the potatoes were boiled, and a half cup 
sugar, and it is ready for use again when it is risen. 

GRAHAM BREAD -Mrs. Baldwin 

Stir into a quart of water (warm in winter and cold in sum- 
mer) enough wheat flour to make a soft batter, also a cup of 
yeast. Let rise over night. In the morning add salt, one-half 
tea cup molasses, one teaspoon soda in cup of boiling water and 
enough Graham flour to make batter thick enough to pour into 
well greased tins. Let rise very light and bake in moderate oven.

One heaping cup flour, two-thirds cup cold boiled rice, one and 
one-half cups sour milk, one tablespoon butter, one egg, pinch 
salt, one teaspoon soda. Beat hard and bake in buttered gem 
pans, in hot oven about twenty minutes. 

GOOD BROWN BREAD-Mrs. A. Faught 

One cup Indian meal, one cup of rye, one cup of wheat flour, 
one cup sour milk, one-half cup molasses, one teaspoon salt, two 
teaspoons soda. Steam four hours and then put it in the oven 
a little while.

tartar and one teaspoon salt. Sift all together. Rub in one table- 
spoon lard, mix with sweet milk to soft dough and bake im- 
mediately.

to this one cup of molasses. Thoroughly mix; pour over dry in- 
gredients, mixing well. Pour into greased two-quart molds, 
cover tight, and steam five hours. Lift out, allow to cool, and 
bake half an hour. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD— Mrs. Wilkinson 

Three eggs, one breakfast cup of milk, one tablespoon melted 
butter, one tablespoon sugar, a pinch of salt, two heaping tea- 
spoons of baking powder. Beat the eggs well and mix with the 
milk; put melted butter with the above ingredients, mixing in 
flour enough to make batter. Bake in round tins, and when al- 
most done wash the top of each with a feather dipped in milk. 

POP-OVERS— Miss Annie Laughlin

Beat thoroughly and cook in hot oven.

Rub one tablespoon butter and one tablespoon lard into one 
quart sifted flour, one teaspoon salt, milk enough to make a stiff 
dough. Use the hands in mixing dough. When the milk, flour and 
shortening have been thoroughly mixed, flour the bread-board, lay 
dough on it and beat it with rolling pin until it blisters and cracks 
loudly. This beating will occupy at least one-half hour. When 
the blisters are abundant, tear off pieces of dough as large as 
an egg, mold with hand in form of a biscuit. Prick the top of 
each biscuit with fork and bake in moderate oven.

teen minutes. Set in cool place for six hours and then roll out 
about one-half inch thick and cut with a biscuit cutter. Moisten 
one edge with butter, and fold together like rolls; lay in the pan 
so they will not touch. Set for half hour in a warm place to rise

DELICIOUS BREAD-Mrs. J. W. Mitchell 

One quart flour, one-half cup sugar, two teaspoons baking- 
powder sifted together dry. Rub in piece of butter the size of 
an egg. Add yolks of two or three eggs and milk enough to 
make a stiff batter. Beat until well blistered, then fold in the 
whites of eggs. 

HOT CROSS BUNS— Mrs. E. S. Denner 

Sift into a bowl one quart of flour, half a cup of sugar, and a 
teaspoon of salt; melt one-fourth cup of butter in a generous 
half-pint of milk, warmed; add to the dry ingredients with the 
well-beaten yolks of two eggs, and half a good yeast cake dis- 
solved in water, half a grated nutmeg, and the whites of eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth. This will make a very soft dough. 
Cover in warm place, and let rise until light. When raised, take 
out on well-floured board, and mold pieces the size of an egg, 
flatten, and place in buttered pan, allowing space between. 
Cover and put to rise until they double in size, then make a 
cross in the top of each, and bake in steady oven half an hour. 
Brush the top over with syrup made from sugar and a little 
water to glaze.

cup water, one-third cup melted butter, one-fourth cup sugar, 
one-half teaspoonful salt, one egg, grating of lemon rind, flour. 
Make a sponge with the milk, yeast softened in the water, and 
flour; when light add the other ingredients and flour to make a 
very stiff batter; beat thoroughly; when light again spread in a 
buttered dripping-pan, cover and let rise. When ready for the 
oven, brush over with beaten egg and dust thickly with sugar 
and cinnamon, mixed. Bake in a hot oven. 

SALLY LUNN-Janet Mackenzie Hill

—Rabelais. 

SOUP STOCK 

To a two-bit shin of beef I add what beefsteak and meatbones 
I may have, add six quarts of water, cover tightly, and boil 
gently all day. Strain at night and set away to cool. The next 
day skim the fat from it and, if the stock is not a thick jelly, 
put it on the stove and boil still longer. This should make three 
quarts of rich jelly, to which you can add rice, barley, macaroni, 
vermicelli or vegetables, or whatever you fancy, as a flavoring. 
The fat I skim from the soup I put on the stove and boil until 
it is transparent, pour it into a small pan or tin and use it in the 
place of butter or lard for cooking. It is much superior to but- 
ter or lard for frying or shortening. 

BEAN SOUP-Mrs. Ford 

Wash and boil your beans with a piece of salt pork. When 
the beans are soft take them out and press through a colander, 
then put them back in the water they were boiled in, together 
with four hard boiled eggs, quartered, and half a lemon sliced, 
a little pepper and salt. Boil up and serve. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Boil two bunches of asparagus one-half hour. Put one quart 
milk on stove, press tender stalks through colander into milk. 
Thicken with two tablespoons flour rubbed into one tablespoon 
butter. Let come to a boil and serve hot. Season with pepper 
and salt. 

CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP-Mrs. A. L. House 

One quart milk, one can tomatoes strained, one teaspoon of 
soda in tomatoes just before removing from the stove. Butter 
size of an egg, salt and cayenne pepper to taste, two crackers 
rolled fine. Heat milk and tomatoes separately. Mix in tureen 
just before serving. 

OYSTER STEW— Mrs. R. H. Thomson 

One can of best cove oysters, one quart sweet milk, one table- 
spoon butter, two tablespoons flour, salt and pepper to taste. 



18 

Strain the liquor from the oysters and to this add the milk. 
When it has reached the boiling point thicken with the flour 
into which the butter has been rubbed. When this has boiled, 
pour over the oysters which are in the soup tureen and serve 
immediately. 

POTATO SOUP-Mrs. Eldredge 

Four medium sized potatoes cut in very small pieces. Pour on 
one quart boiling water, little salt, pepper and good slice of but- 
ter. Let boil until soft. Rub through a sieve. Just before serv- 
ing add one teaspoon of flour mixed with cold water, two cups 
of milk and let boil up once. 

ONION SOUP-Mrs. Bryant 

Slice and fry six large onions until quite brown, add two 
quarts rich milk, one tablespoon butter, one teaspoon cayenne 
pepper and salt to taste. Thicken with two tablespoons flour 
mixed with cold water. Serve very hot. 

SPLIT PEA SOUP-Mrs. R. H. Thomson 

One cup split peas, one and one-half pounds lean neck of beef 
(no bone) , two thin slices of salt pork, three quarts cold water. 
Wash and soak peas for an hour, cut meat in small pieces. Put 
all together in soup kettle and cook for three hours; you may 
have to add some boiling water at the last. When done thicken 
with one tablespoon of flour rubbed smooth in one-half cup of 
creamy milk; strain and serve with toast bread cubes. 

CREAM CELERY SOUP-Mrs. S. E. Polhemus 

Take the root and several stalks of celery cut in small pieces, 
cover with water (being careful not to use too much) add a lump 
of butter and salt and pepper. Boil until celery is tender, then 
add a quart of milk and let come to the boiling point. Take three 
or four slices of bread cut in small squares and fry in a little 
butter to a light brown, place in tureen and pour the soup over 
them. 

BEAN SOUP-Mrs. R. H. Thomson 

One large cup of small white beans, two pounds lean neck of 
beef. Soak the beans over night and boil three-fourths of an 
hour, changing water twice. Put the beans into the soup kettle 
with the meat, cook until the beans can not be found, and the 
meat to shreds. Salt and pepper to taste, add a cup of creamy 
milk, strain and serve. This is also nice with toast cubes 
instead of crackers. 



19 
CLAM SOUP-Mrs. SamuelJ. Holms 

Place one pint clams in bowl and chop very fine. Put one 
quart milk on the stove with the liquor of the c'ams, season 
with pepper and salt. Roll four or five crackers and sprinkle in 
milk. Chop fine one small piece of onion and let all boil up. 
Just before removing from the fire put in butter the size of a 
walnut. 

CLAM CHOWDER— Mrs. W. P. Slusser 

One dozen and one-half of clams. Scrub shells and place in 
a kettle over the fire. Cover with one quart of boiling water. 
As soon as shells open, remove from fire. Save the water. Chop 
fine a little salt pork, and slice four large potatoes thin. Put 
pork in kettle; after frying until brown add strained water and 
the juice of the clams, the potatoes, and three onions sliced thin. 
Simmer one and one-quarter hours. Add a quart of milk, or 
water if preferred, cook fifteen minutes longer, add clams and 
serve. 

TOMATO FOR SOUPS, SAUCES, ETC.— Mrs. M. J. Granger 

Skin and boil tomatoes, then strain free from seeds. Then 
boil down as thick as possible without burning, and bottle hot 
in glass jars or bottles that can be made air tight, the same as 
in canning fruit. Small bottles are preferable to large ones, as 
it does not keep well after being opened. The pulp after being 
boiled down, can also be dried, by being spread thinly on buttered 
plates. The dried pulp readily dissolves in soup. 

NOODLES— Mrs. E. S. Denner 

Into two eggs work with a knife as much flour as possible, 
also a pinch of salt. Turn out on molding-board and mold well, 
using plenty of flour. Roll very thin, and leave for two or three 
hours to dry. Cut in equal pieces and place one above the other, 
then cut in thin strips and shake loosely apart. Put into rapidly 
boiling water for ten minutes. Have ready frying-pan with a 
good piece of butter melted and hot; remove the noodles with a 
skimmer, let drain a minute, then put into the pan with the 
butter for ten minutes, and serve. Good with or without meat. 

FRENCH SOUP-Mrs. E. S. Denner 

In a strong, clear soup, just before serving, add two well 
beaten eggs very gradually. Pour into tureen at once.

Pick to pieces, fish previously boiled, season with salt, pepper, 
and butter, mix in rolled crackers or bread crumbs, cover with 
cream and bake. 

CREAMED SALMON— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Make a white sauce of one-half pint milk and as much cream, 
two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour. Melt butter, 
stirring in flour and diluting with hot cream and milk. Season 
with salt, cayenne, and nutmeg. To this add a can of nice sal- 
mon freed from skin and bone. Stir until hot and serve in little 
individual cases. 

FILLETS OF FISH WITH BECHAMEL SAUCE— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Slice salmon or any white fish; fry lightly in butter for six 
minutes, then dip in beaten egg, roll in crumbs, season, dot 
thickly with butter and place in a good oven for fifteen minutes. 
Serve with a sauce made by melting one tablespoonful of butter, 
rub smoothly in this one of flour, and dilute with a half pint of 
stock made from chicken or veal; season nicely, lift out fish, 
sprinkle thickly with minced parsley and pour the sauce over. 
You can prepare the fish beforehand, cooking it only ten min- 
utes, and then merely place in the oven to heat while the soup 
is being served. The sauce will keep if stood in a vessel of hot 
water. 



24 
CREAMED OYSTERS— Mrs. Samuel J. Holms 

One-half teacup of butter melted in a sauce-pan. Add one 
heaping tablespoonful flour. Cook a few minutes and stir in 
gradually one cup of milk, seasoned with salt and pepper. Boil 
one pint of fresh oysters in their own liquor until plump, drain, 
and place on squares of buttered toast. Pour the sauce over 
and serve immediately. 

HALIBUT STEAK- Mrs. R. H. Thomson 

Cut fish one and one-half inches thick, remove the bones and 
skin. Place in cold water and salt one hour before cooking, 
drain and wipe. Dip pieces of fish in beaten egg, roll in crack- 
er crumbs, submerge in hot fat and fry until a delicate brown, 
Remove with wire skimmer and serve immediately, Cooked in 
this way it retains its delicate flavor and is free from grease. 

OKRA GUMBO (Creole) —Mrs. H. H. Brooks 

One onion, one tablespoon of flour, parsley, thyme, two cloves 
of garlic, salt to taste, one slice of ham, three dozen shrimps, 
one-half dozen crabs, two large tomatoes, one-half pod of red 
pepper (without seeds) , one bay leaf, fifty green okra pods, cut 
fine. Cut ham in small squares, put into lard and let brown; 
then put in onions, parsley, and thyme. Skin and chop fine the 
tomatoes and put in, saving out the juice. Let cook ten min- 
utes and put in the flour. When brown put in the crabs and let 
cook another ten minutes, covering tight. Then put in chopped 
okra, and watch carefully, as okra burns easily. When okra 
browns put in two quarts of water with the tomato juice; set 
back on the stove and let simmer for about an hour longer. Put 
in the shrimps (prepared by scalding and removing the shells 
or skin) about twenty minutes before serving. Serve hot with 
boiled rice. (Prepare the crabs by scalding or boiling about five 
minutes. When cool enough cut off claws and crack, separating 
the joints. Remove the "apron," the spongy substance, and 
the shell, and cut the body into four parts, cutting down the 
center and across. ) 

BAKED HALIBUT WITH TOMATO SAUCE— Mrs. M. D. Brown 

Two pounds fish. Cook two cups tomatoes with one cup water,

fourth cup of flour; add the fish and a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley. When the mixture is thoroughly cold, form into chops. 
Egg and bread-crumb them, adding a little chopped parsley to 
the crumbs. Put a piece of macoroni into the end of the chop,

crabs, put into the sauce, stew two minutes, and serve on toast. 

CRAB a La NEWBURG— Miss Marion W. Thomson

boiled egg, rubbing the yolk in one tablespoon melted butter;

per, mustard, and salt to taste; one and one-half mustard-spoons

To Preserve 
the Eyesight 



Infant's eyes should not be exposed to intense sunlight; 
if left to wink and blink at the sun permanent bad effects 
may result to the retina or other parts of the eye. 

Vision is a mechanical function, and as few eyes are 
proportioned so as to give perfect sight, the sooner marked 
defects, indicated by eyeache, headache, inflamed eyes and 
lids are corrected with glasses the better for either children 
or adults. No strain, no pain. No injury to an organ, no 
disease of it. Glasses fitted by us will give perfect vision 
and keep the eyes healthy and strong.

OLD-FASHIONED FRITTERS— Mrs. Parker Maddux 

Beat five eggs light, add a cup of milk, a half cup of water, 
and a scant teaspoonful of baking-powder. Flour enough to

And some would eat that want it. 
But we hae meat, and we can eat,

RULES FOR COOKING MEATS 



Put all salt meats in cold water; all fresh meats, excepting 
for soups, into hot water, then cook slowly. All roast meats, 
excepting veal, are put dry into a very hot oven; veal requiring 
a little more moisture. When well browned, add hot water; and 
when about half done, salt. Never salt meat until partially 
cooked. Rare meat requires about fifteen minutes to the pound. 
Baste all roasts frequently. Roast beef requires a hotter oven 
than any other meat. 

MOLDED VEAL— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Ten cent knuckle veal and boil until it can be pierced with 
fork. Take from liquor and cool. When cold cut into small 
pieces. Have ready three hard boiled eggs. Slice eggs length- 
wise. Commence by putting slices of egg in mold, then meat 
and alternate in this wise until all is used with an occasional all 
clove and pepper corn. When all is ready pour over the liquor 
which is boiling hot and has been freed from grease or settlings. 
Set away to cool. Serve cold cut in slices. If liquor seems too 
thin, add one teaspoon Knox Gelatine. 

DUMPLINGS— Mrs. Miller 

To each cup full of sifted flour add one teaspoon of baking 
powder, add a little salt, sift until thoroughly mixed, then add 
half as much milk as flour (by measure) and beat a minute. 
Drop by spoonfuls into the stew, cover tightly and boil twelve 
minutes. 

STUFFING FOR A TURKEY 

For a turkey weighing from eight to ten pounds allow one loaf 
of stale baker's bread, one quart of oysters, one lemon, two 



42 

roots of celery and one-quarter of a pound of butter. It is taken 
for granted that the turkey is thoroughly cleaned and wiped dry 
before putting the stuffing in. Crumble the bread till very fine; 
season with pepper and salt. Drain the oysters, setting the 
liquor aside. Now take a very sharp knife and peel off the 
outer rind of the lemon, being careful not to have any of the 
bitter and tough white skin left on. Cut the peel in very small 
bits, chop the white part of the celery very fine, adding the but- 
ter and the juice of the lemon. Mix the ingredients mentioned, 
stirring until thoroughly mixed; then proceed to stuff body and 
crop. A turkey of the size spoken of requires at least two hours 
baking, and it should be basted frequently; the liquor of the 
oysters should be put in the pan when the pan is first set in the 
oven, and this is to be used in basting. The giblets and livers 
should be cooked in a basin on top of the stove, then chopped 
fine, and when the gravy is made, add them to it. 

VEAL OR. BEEF LOAF— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Three pounds chopped veal or beef, three well-beaten eggs, 
salt and pepper to taste, one-half cup butter. Powdered cracker 
to make the above the consistency of dough. Make into a loaf 
and bake until done, basting with butter. Use hot water to 
moisten the ingredients if it is too dry to mold with hand. 

BOILED TONGUE— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Soak tongue over night and boil four hours in milk and water, 
peel and place on platter; garnish with parsley. 

DAUBE a La CREOLE -Mrs. H. H. Brooks 

Three pounds of the round of veal or beef, two large onions, 
two tablespoons of flour, two cloves of garlic, two large toma- 
toes, one bay leaf, one sprig of thyme and parsley, salt, pepper, 
and cayenne to taste, one tablespoon of lard. Make incisions 
in the meat and put the garlic into them; then rub the meat 
well with salt and pepper. Put into the hot lard and cover well; 
when brown on both sides put in a half cup of water; when this 
cooks up, put in onions and flour; when brown put in tomatoes 
and other ingredients, and set back on stove; let simmer slowly 
about five minutes, then put in three cups of water and let cook 
one hour slowly.

CANNELON OF BEEF— Janet Mackenzie Hill 

Two pounds of lean beef from top of round, one tablespoon- 
f ul of fine-chopped parsley, one teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, one-fourth teaspoonful of mace, one 
egg beaten, one-third cup of soft bread crumbs, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of pepper. Pass the meat through a chopper several 
times; add the other ingredients, the egg, beaten, and the bread 
crumbs, wrung dry after standing some time in cold water; mix 
thoroughly and shape in a roll. Bake on a rack in a small pan 
between thirty and forty minutes. Baste frequently with fat 
from salt pork and hot water. Serve, if desired, with tomato 
sauce. 

GRILLADES a La CREOLE— Mrs. H. H. Brooks 

One round steak, two tomatoes, one large onion, one clove of 
garlic, salt and pepper and cayenne to taste. Select a nice round 
steak and beat well; cut into grillades (pieces) about four inches 
square. Put a tablespoon of lard in a deep frying-pan and cover 
closely. When the steak browns put in a half cup of water and 
set back on the stove; when this browns put in the sliced onions 
and garlic; when a light brown, put in a tablespoon of flour, and 
as it browns, put in tomatoes and let brown. Then put in two cups 
of water and stir well. Set it back on stove and let it simmer 
slowly for about half an hour. This makes enough for six 
persons. 

WHOLESOME WAY TO COOK HAM— Miss C. Denner 

Cut the pieces of meat in full thick slices straight across the 
ham, and place them in a frying-pan, covering well with boiling 
water. Set the pan directly over the fire for a few minutes, 
that it may boil rapidly, and then transfer it to the bottom of 
the oven, where it must be left to cook slowly for fully one hour. 
Replenish the pan with hot water as often as necessary, as the 
ham must not actually "fry" until the hour has passed. When 
this time has elapsed, howeyer, return the pan to the top of the 
stove that the meat may brown. 

A GOOD WAY TO COOK MUTTON OR LAMB- Mrs. Chas. Hoffer 

Take a leg of lamb and put in a kettle with some lard and 
brown thoroughly, then add one-half cup of water and cook 
gently for one-half hour. Then add one cup of clabber and one 
cup of sour cream, and about a tablespoon of salt. Cook slowly 
for two hours. Serve with mashed potatoes.

Select two chickens about a year old, clean, cut up well, and 
stew in just enough water to cover. When nearly cooked, 
season with salt and pepper. Stew down until the water is 
nearly all boiled out and the meat drops easily from the bones. 
Remove the bones and gristle, chop the meat rather coarsely, 
then put back into the stew kettle with broth (first skimming 
off all fat), and let it heat again. Turn it into an oblong bread- 
pan, drop in along center four hard boiled eggs. Place a weight

Success depends upon not having too much water, and see that 
the chickens are not too young.

Add four tablespoons grated cheese, stir well, and when thor- 
oughly hot put into baking dish that can go on table. Drop in 
eggs as if for poaching, and bake in hot oven until eggs are set. 

CROQUETTES— Miss E. Granger 

One cup of cold cooked meat or fowl, one cup of dry bread or 
cracker crumbs, one egg, one small onion chopped fine, one 
tablespoon of melted butter, salt and pepper, a little sage or 
other preferred herb. Chop or grind the meat, and mix all the 
ingredients with enough milk to enable the mixture to be mold- 
ed into soft flat cakes. Fry brown. If a little cooked fat salt 
pork or ham can be added, the butter may be omitted. The 
quantities may be somewhat varied, and the addition of cold 
cooked vegetables will vary the flavor. 

RICE SPANISH- Mrs. Chas. Roat 

Put one-half cup rice into a pan with one heaping tablespoon 
lard, and let boil until all the kernels turn white. Add one 
quart tomatoes, one green pepper, one large onion browned in

of milk or chicken stock or part of each, one-half cup of fine 
bread crumbs, three eggs, one pint of fine chopped chicken 
(cold) , salt and paprika, onion juice, parsley, celery-salt. Make 
a sauce of the first three ingredients; add the bread crumbs, 
the chicken (cooked and chopped very fine) , the yolks of eggs

hour or longer. Fry one large onion and two Chili peppers until 
well done, add one quart of tomatoes, salt, a few sparing dashes 
of cinnamon and nutmeg, one tablespoon sugar, one-quarter 
cup vinegar. Let boil and add to tripe after water has been 
poured off. Boil a few minutes. 

GULOSCH— Mrs. Parker Maddux 

Put some drippings or lard in a pot or other rather deep 
utensil, and fry with an onion cut up fine. Cut up lean beef in 
pieces the size of an egg, rub in flour, flavor with white pepper 
and salt. Fry a little, then set it on the back of the stove and 
let cook three hours in its own juices; then put in half a cup of 
sour cream, which makes a thick rich gravy. 

DEVILLED EGGS— Mrs. W. C. Fowler 

Prepare a dressing of one-half cup rich thick cream beaten 
until it begins to swell, one teaspoon sugar, one-half teaspoon 
mustard, a dash of cayenne, salt, and one-fourth cup vinegar 
added last and slowly. Have as many eggs as desired hard 
boiled and cold. Remove shells and cut in halves, lengthwise, 
and remove hard yolks. Mash yolks well with a fork and add 
to them enough or all of the dressing to make a moist filling for 
the whites of the eggs. Then fill them and round up the whites 
with the prepared yolks. 



FOR THE SHVAILgD p S TRAY 

"Simple diet is best, for many dishes bring many diseases, 
and rich sauces are worse than even heaping several meats 
upon each other."— Pliny. 

NOURISHING DRINK- Miss Ella Wood 
One teaspoon dry coffee in one cup milk brought to a boil. 
Have ready a well beaten egg, add strained milk to the egg-, 
sweeten if desired. . 

CHEESE STRAWS -Miss Annie Laughlin 
Take a pint of flour and one-half pint grated cheese. Mix 
them and make a paste with lard as you do for pies. Roll out 
in a thick sheet, cut in strips half an inch broad and five or six 
inches long, bake a light brown. 

BEEF BROTH Mrs. Baldwin 

Trim off all the fat from one pound round steak, add three 
coffee cups cold water, also salt and pepper and let simmer 
about one-half hour or until there is a pint of broth. Strain 
through fine sieve and serve hot. 

EXTRACT OF BEEF BLOOD— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Catch in bowl warm beef blood and let it stand until it clots, 
which will not be long. Now take out and lay on a clean and 
smooth board and cut in narrow strips, tilt board and stand in 
hot sun. In a short time all watery substance will have run 
away and that left is dry and will crumble. It must crumble 
or it is not ready, rub in palm of hand until a fine powder, sift 
through fine wire sieve, bottle and it will keep for years. This 
can be taken in plain soup or dry as most acceptable to patient; 
the strength gained is wonderful. When cutting to dry, cut in 
as narrow strips as possible. To be given to any person with 
little strength or vitality. 

GRAPE JUICE -Mrs. Wm. Woolsey 

Take Zinfandel grapes and run through a cider mill. Put juice 
in earthen jars where it stands over night. Next morning pour 
into preserving kettle only what looks clear, rejecting sediment, 
which is the sugar that ferments. Put kettle on fire and bring 
juice to a good boiling point only. Skim if needful. Bottle 
while hot, straining through a thin cloth. Seal bottles and keep 
in a dark place.

BLACKBERRY CORDIAL— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Pick over and wash the berries and drain; place in double 
boiler and let them steam, the water boiling well about them 
for good thirty minutes. Turn them into a jelly bag and hang 
up to drain; do not squeeze the bag. To one pint of juice put 
one-half pound sugar and boil five minutes. When cold add half 
as much brandy as juice. Bottle and cork tight. 

MUTTON TOAST— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Cut in pieces one pound of mutton, the bony part is the best, 
and put on the stove early, in one quart of cold water. Cook 
slowly. When the meat is tender strain the broth through a 
sieve and set away to cool. After removing the grease that has 
risen to the top, let the broth come to boiling, and add flour 
thickening, with a little cream or butter. Meanwhile toast 
slices of white or brown bread, and dip in hot water to soften. 
Pour the stew over the bread, adding the pieces of mutton. 

OAT MEAL BLANC MANGE— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Stir two heaping tablespoonfuls fine oat meal into a little cold 
water and then stir in a quart of boiling milk; boil a few min- 
utes, salt, turn into a mold. When cold eat with jelly and cream. 

PURE BEEF JUICE— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Take good juicy round steak, remove all fat. Place in hat 
skillet, sear both sides of meat, gash pieces with knife, place 
on earthen plate, cover with another plate and set in hot oven. 
Let remain until all juice leaves meat. One tablespoon of this 
juice is equivalent to one cup of broth. 

REFRESHING DRINK— Miss Annie Laughlin 

Cover raspberries with vinegar and soak over night. Drain 
off or squeeze out the juice, to every pint of which add one 
pound of sugar. Let it simmer about fifteen minutes; when 
cool bottle, and when used as a drink put in as much of it to a 
glass of water as is palatable to the invalid. 

Washing Made a Pleasure — HORTON Washing Machine at MAILER'S 



COOBUBJG DIRKED FRUITS 



To make a most delicious conserve of either apples, apricots, 
pears, peaches, figs or prunes, proceed as follows: Pick over the 
fruit and wash it thoroughly but quickly. Put it in a dish, 
earthen is preferable, at about noontime, and covering it gen- 
erously with water, allow it to soak during that afternoon and 
night. In the morning take the fruit carefully out into a cook- 
ing utensil — a graniteware kettle or saucepan or an earthen 
crock — and pour over it, being careful not to disturb the sedi- 
ment at the bottom, the water in which it was soaked; then 
cover the dish tightly and set it either on the back of the range 
or in a moderate oven, where it will quietly simmer, and let it 
remain there for eight or ten hours. 

If you have an unreasoning sweet tooth, and must spoil things 
with sugar, add that article not more than twenty minutes be- 
fore removing the cooked fruit from the range, and add it spar- 
ingly, since, by this method of cooking, all the natural flavor 
and saccharine quality of the fruits are preserved, and nearly 
everyone who is privileged to taste them thus prepared readily 
concedes that they are quite "sufficient unto themselves." 

Prunes and dried grapes become simply "idealized" under 
this treatment- plump, smooth, juicy and generally delicious, 
and the sliced or quartered fruits rival the daintiest and richest 
of preserves in their amber-hued translucency, as well as in 
flavor. 

Verily, if the cooks and housewives would add to their little 
bills of fares the dried fruits of California, cooked after the 
fashion herein prescribed, the cry for "more" would be so loud 
and so unanimous that all the State's broad orchards would be 
quite inadequate to supply the demand of even the home market.
