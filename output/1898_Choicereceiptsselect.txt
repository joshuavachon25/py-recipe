RED PUDDING NO. i. 

This pudding is known as Rothe Grutze in Sweden, where it is 
a favorite dessert. The receipt for making it was lately brought to 
America by the proprietor of a famous hostelry, who stated that it 
was worth to him the entire cost of his summer journeyings. By 
the original formula fresh fruits are required, but we give below an 
additional receipt, the result of a recent experiment, by which the 

62 



/'r/)/)/.y(;s, j\isyK]\ arc. 

pudding may be made when fresh fruit is not to be had. Rothe 
Grutze, as prepared in Sweden, is made as follows: Take equal 
parts of red currants, raspberries and cold water, and to i qt. of this 
mixture allow iJ^S teacupfuls of sugar; or if the currants are very 
acid and a sweet pudding is desired, increase the (luantity of sugar 
to 2 cupfuls. Now add 2 sticks of cinnamon 3 inches long and not 
too thick, broken into small bits; boil Yi hour in a porcelain or 
enameled kettle or saucepan, and press the whole through a coland- 
er. Next add Yi a teacupful of thinly sliced blanched almonds 
and the same quantity of finely shaved citron, and cook 20 minutes 
longer. Thicken the liquid with rice-flour or sago till it is a little 
stifTer than blanc-mange, and pour it into a wet mould; turn it when 
cold upon the serving dish, and pour about it sweetened fresh cream 
or whipped cream. In Sweden the pudding is eaten with thick fresh 
cream, sugar being passed after it is served. 



RED PUDDING NO. 2. 

Mix Y2 pt- currant jelly and the same quantity of red raspberry 
jam with I pt. of water, and add 2 or 3 sticks of cinnamon 2 inches 
long, well broken up. Boil till thoroughly melted, then strain 
through a colander. Return the liquid to the kettle, add Yi a tea- 
cupful each of finely sliced blanched almonds and shaved citron, 
boil 20 minutes, and thicken with rice-flour as in the preceding 
receipt. If candied citron is not at hand, ordinary home-made pre- 
served citron may be sliced into the mixture just before the last 
boiling is completed and the pudding is ready to mould. The pre- 
served citron should be stirred in carefully to prevent breaking. 
Owing to the nature of its ingredients, this pudding should be care- 
fully sweetened to suit the taste. Serve on a pretty dish, surround- 
ing the pudding with whipped and flavored cream or a rich plain 
cream, and ornamenting it, if desired, with quartered almonds thrust 
into the top.

ROMAN PUNCH. 

Prepare a very rich pineappleade and make it a little tart with 
lemon-juice, taking great care that none of the zest or oil from the 
yellow rind or the bitterness from the seeds or the white portion 
of the rind be allowed to afifect its flavor. This preparation must 
be well frozen but, being very rich, it will form only a semi ice. 
Half an hour before the punch is to be served, work into it 
thoroughly i gi. of old Jamaica rum and I2 pt. of the best cham- 
pagne to every qt. of the frozen mixture. After this Havoring has 
been well incorporated, add the well-beaten whites of 2 eggs sweet- 
ened with 2 ozs. of powdered sugar, stir the whole vigorously, turn 
the crank a few times more, and set the punch aside till needed. 

The history of punch a la romaine is rather a curious one and is 
not generally known. The punch was for nearly a century the fav- 
orite summer refreshment of successive Popes, and their cooks were 
bound in the most solemn manner to preserve inviolable the secret 
of its compounding. When Napoleon invaded Italy in 1796, a 
young son of the chief confectioner to Pius VI., Molas by name, 
ran away from his father and his post in the culinary department 
of the Vatican, and united his fortunes with those of the conqueror. 
He soon became a favorite servant of the ill-starred Josephine, and 
when she died, he obtained a situation in the kitchen of a Russian 
prince. This prince was shortly afterward appointed ambassador to 
the court of St. James and, taking his Italian cook with him to Lon- 
don, was the first to introduce Roman punch in that city, greatly 
delighting his guests with the new delicacy. The receipt was sent 
to Carlton House in compliance with the wish of the Prince Regent, 
who in turn permitted copies to be sent to a select few of his friends. 
Thus by degrees the punch became widely known, while the sing- 
ular tale of its origin was well-nigh forgotten.

74 



FOR /WW LIDS 

CHICKEN JELLY. 
(Very Nouri.'^hing.) 
Half a raw chicken pounded with a mallet, bones and meat 
together; plenty of cold water to cover it well (about i qt.). Heat 
slowly in a covered vessel, and let it simmer till the meat is in white 
rags and the liquid reduced y'y. Strain and press, first through 
a colander, then through a coarse cloth. Salt to taste, and pepper, 
if desired; return to fire and simmer s minutes longer. Skim when 
cool; give to the patient cold from the ice, with unleavened wafers; 
keep on the ice. You can make it into sandwiches by putting the 
jelly between thin slices of bread lightly spread with butter. 

FLOUR B.-\LL. 
Take I lb. good wheat flour (unbolted is best), tie up very tightly 
in strong pudding bag, place in saucepan of water and boil steadily 
for ID hours. When cold remove cloth, cut ofif soft outer covering, 
and as required, reduce hard interior to a powder by grating. When 
using rub the quantity ordered to a powder, adding a table-spoonful 
of milk and reducing to a smooth paste, add second table-spoonful 
of milk to give creamy mixture and add to total quantity of liquid 
ordered for a meal. 

LIME WATER. 
Drop a piece of unslaked lime as large as a walnut into 2 qts. pure 
filtered water in an earthen vessel, stir thoroughly and allow to 
settle. Use only from top, replacing water and stirring as 
consumed. 

LE.\IONADE. 

\\ hen the throat is dry and irritated, a little weak slippery elm 
or flaxseed tea may be prepared and kept in the ice-box for making 
lemonade, provided lemons are allowed. 

WINE WHEY. 
Boil I pt. of milk in an earthenware or enameled saucepan; as 
soon as the milk begins to rise in a foam, turn into it 2 glasses of 



CHOICE RECEIPTS 

sherry, stir thoroughly, and then draw it back where it cannot 
scorch, so that it may stand undisturbed till the curd sets. Strain 
the liquid, sweeten and cool it by placing ice about the vessel. 

SANDWICHES. 

If the patient is permitted to eat a little solid food, delicious and 
nourishing sandwiches may be made by scraping fresh beef on 
which there is no fat and mixing with a little potted or scraped 
boiled salt tongue. Spread this mixture over thin slices of yester- 
day's bread, trim them neatly after the parts are pressed together, 
and cut them in 2-inch squares. Arrange them invitingly upon a 
pretty plate or upon a folded napkin, and serve on any little dish or 
tray. If no tongue is at hand, salt must be added to the beef. 

OATMEAL OR CRACKED WHEAT WATER. 

Add I to 3 table-spoonfuls well-cooked oatmeal or cracked wheat 
porridge to i pt. water, heat almost to boiling point, stirring con- 
stantly till smooth, strain. The amount of porridge to be added 
varies from i to 3 teaspoonfuls to a pt. of water, according to thick- 
ness of the porridge, and whether a thinner or thicker oatmeal 
water is desired. 

RAW BEEF JUICE. 

Warm i lb. sirloin beef in a broiler before a quick fire, cut into 
^-inch cubes, place in lemon squeezer or meat press and forcibly- 
express juice. Remove fat rising to surface after cooling. Never 
actually cook the meat. 



MISCELLANEOUS 

What's there? '" 

Thing's for the cook. sir. but I know not what." 



Wlicn Ijakinsa: a cake do not s]ani the oven door or the cake may 
fall. 

The coflfee-pot will lose its musty odor, if a spoonful of borax is 
boiled in it once a week. A pinch of borax placed in the coffee 
releases the essential oils of the coffee and improves the aroma. 

To keep fruit jellies from molding, put an even half inch of sugar 
over the top after the jelly has cooled and then cover the glass with 
thick paper that has been coated with white of egg. 

When meats are being roasted and there is danger of their becom- 
ing too brown, place a basin of water in the oven. The steam will 
prevent scorching, and the meat will cook better. 

Food that has little odor itself and food that absorbs odors 
readily should be placed at the bottom of the refrigerator. All 
foods with a strong odor should be ke])t on the top shelves. Sour 
milk or cream should not be kept in the refrigerator. Salad dress- 
ings, tartar sauce and celery shouUl be covered closely or they 
will flavor everything that is shut u]) with them. Pineapple, straw- 
berries and raspberries should not 1)e shut into common ice chest 
with milk or cream. In the refrigerators where there is a circula- 
tion of dry air, butter, milk, cream and other delicate foods may be kept 
in the lower part of the refrigerator, and the fruits, vegetables, etc., 
with strong flavors and odors may be kept on the top shelves. If 
arranged in this wa)', there w'lll be but little danger that one kind of 
food will absorb the flavor or odor of another. 



CHOICE RECEIPTS 

POTPOURRI OF LAVENDER. 

(Delicious for Linen Closet.) 

One lb. dried lavender, i lb. dried rose leaves, 1/2 lb. coarsely 
crushed orris-root, 2 ozs. broken cloves, 2 ozs. cinnamon, 2 ozs. 
allspice, i lb. dry table salt. Keep in air-tight jar for a couple of 
weeks before using. — Mrs. Clark. 

ROSE PASTE. 

A delicate flavor of rose leaves is a great addition to certain 
cakes and confections, and a rose paste made at home is much 
purer than many of the extracts sold for the purpose. Chop the 
leaves of fragrant roses into a smooth mass with white sugar and 
place them in an oven long enough to heat thoroughly, but not 
entirely melt the sugar. Use i cupful of the leaves to 3 of sugar. 
Keep in air-tight cans and allow to stand 6 months before opening. 
The paste must be used carefully, only a small quantity being neces- 
sary to flavor a large cake. A novelty at a recent dinner was a 
Roman punch flavored in this way with the Turkish preserved rose 
leaves, which may be purchased at any store dealing in Oriental 
goods. Into an ordinary Roman punch the rose leaves were stirred, 
a few at a time, until a delicate flavor was obtained, and the mix- 
ture was then frozen to a soft and snowy consistency and served in 
small glasses. Half a can of the Turkish leaves would flavor a 
sufficient quantity for eight persons. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR FOR WATER ICES. 

To each qt. of water allow 2 lbs. of granulated sitgar and i tea- 
spoonful of whipped white of t^^. Mix all well together, and boil 
the liquid 7 or 8 minutes. All scum should be carefully removed 
and the syrup allowed to cool before adding the fruit juices.

Take 2 lbs. powdered Florentine orris-root, i lb. rose petals, 1 lb. 
cassia flower-heads, i lb. black currant leaves, ^ dr. attar of

powder stand in a tight glass jar for a week before using.
