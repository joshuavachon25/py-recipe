MOTH-INFESTED BISCUIT. 



REPORT OF THE TEMPERATURE REACHED 
IN ARMY BISCUITS DURING BAKING. 
ESPECIALLY WITH REFERENCE TO THE 
DESTRUCTION OF THE IMPORTED FLOUR- 
MOTH, EPHESTIA KUHNIELLA Zeller. 

By J. HARTLEY DURRANT, F.E.S., Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), and 
Colonel W. W. O. BEVERIDGE, C.B., D.S.O., R.A.M.C. 

For some time past attention has been drawn to the fact that ration 
biscuits exported to the Colonies have become after a time quite 
unfit for consumption, owing to the ravages of certain moths and 
beetles — this has been specially noted in South Africa, Ceylon, 
Gibraltar, Malta, Mauritius, and the Sudan. 

An enquiry has been undertaken to endeavour to ascertain : — 

(1) How and when infestation of biscuit takes place ; 

(2) Whether any steps can be taken to avoid, or minimise, such 
infestation. 

The insects met with during this enquiry are all widely distri- 
buted species whose range has doubtless been greatly extended by 
commerce — all occur in this country. The list is as follows : —

Linne, were found, and the beetles Palorus melinus Herbst, and 
Latheticus oryzac Waterhouse, have not yet been met with by us. 

First, as to infestation : — Biscuit must become infested either 
(1) at home before packing, (2) during transit, or (3) in the country 
where stored. The biscuits are packed in tins, liermetically sealed, 
and enclosed in wooden cases to prevent injury ; it was, therefore, 
obvious that if insects could be found within intact tins it would be 
demonstrated at once that infestment must have taken place in the 
factories, and not subsequently. With a view to determine the 
origin of infestation, sample tins were withdrawn from stocks at 
various stations abroad, for inspection at Woolwich by experts, and 
tins, which after careful examination had been pronounced intact, 
were found to contain Ephcstia kuhniella, etc., in various stages of 
development ; thus proving conclusively that infestation had taken 
place in the factories before the tins were soldered, and indicating 
that preventative or remedial measures must be undertaken in the 
factories themselves. 

It is obvious, either that the heat acquired by biscuit in the 
process of baking is insufficient to destroy ova present in the moist 
dough, or that moths and beetles deposit their ova in or on the 
biscuits after baking, and during the process of cooling or packing in 
the tins. Cooling before packing is necessary, to allow the moisture 
in the centre of the biscuit to become evenly distributed throughout, 
and it is during the time occupied in cooling and packing that the 
biscuit is exposed to the greatest risk of infestation — any risk 
occasioned by subsequent injury to the case must be quite excep- 
tionalj and is probably unimportant. 

The flour when received is often infested by insects in various 
stages, and the suggestion has been made that possil)ly the tempera- 
ture reached during baking is not sufficient to sterilise the interior 
of the biscuit. What exactly occurs during the baking of the biscuit 
does not appear to have been accurately recorded, and some attempt has 
been made during this in vestigation to obtain an insight into the process. 

In order to ascertain whether the heat within the biscuit durinf^ 
baking was of sufficient intensity to destroy the ova of these pests, 
it was necessary to determine the temperature actually reached in the 
interior of the biscuits during baking, and also the lowest tempera- 
ture that would destroy the living ova within a reasonable time. 

At the request of Brig.-General S. S. Long, Director of Supplies, 
we carried out some thermometric experiments at the factory of 
Messrs. Spillers and Bakers, at Bermondsey, who very kindly placed

their ovens at our disposal, and their consulting chemist, Mr. F. G. 
Treharne, and Mr. E. Belfield, lent us every assistance. 

Army Biscuits are made from dough containing about 25 per cent, 
of water, and when stamped-out are immediately placed on the floor 
of an oven and baked in about 20 minutes while travelling a distance 
of about 40 feet. During baking the moisture is reduced to about 
10 per cent., and collects in the centre of the mass of the biscuit, in 
consequence of its external hardening, or caramel isation — the holes 
pricked in the biscuits enable them to part readily with excessive 
moisture. After cooling, the moisture distributes itself throughout 
the biscuit, and, as shown by analysis, then averages between 8 and 
10 per cent. If the biscuits were packed immediately after baking, 
while hot, they would contain an excess of moisture and could not 
be supplied in accordance with specification. 

To determine accurately the range of temperature within the 
biscuits, during the passage through the oven, it was necessary to 
employ some form of apparatus by which the actual temperature 
during the whole, process of baking could be recorded. Ordinary 
thermometers, contact thermometers, fusible metals and other such- 
like devices cannot in general register accurate results, for although 
the maximum temperature reached in the biscuit can be determined 
by thermometers and contact thermometers, the range, distribution 
and variations cannot be recorded. Fusible alloys in the form of 
beads are not satisfactory for exact work, as they can only record 
a temperature corresponding to the melting point selected. The 
melting point itself cannot always be depended upon to give constant 
results, as the mass of metal, in contact thermometers and fusible 
metals, acts as a reservoir of heat and will not respond as rapidly as 
desired. It was necessary, therefore, in this case to use some form 
of instrument which would indicate only the heat of that portion of 
the biscuit with which it was in direct contact, and to ensure that 
other sources of external heat were entirely excluded. To meet these 
requirements a thermocouple was used in the present experiments. 
{See Plate II.) 

The apparatus consisted of : — 

(1) A Thermocouple. — This was inserted into the centre of the 
biscuit at equal distance from either surface. It consisted of two 
wires, one of constantan, the other of copper, L.S.G., 030 in size, 
and about four inches long — these were soldered together at one end 
by means of silver solder. The free ends of the wire were in turn 
connected to thicker bare constantan and copper wires, 57 feet in 



PLATE II.

length, which were insulated by glass tubes and mica discs, and 
again connected to copper and constantan wires made up info a 
flexible braided cable. 

(2) The Cold Junction. — Nine inches of the approximate length 
of the constantan wire were left bare, and this length was soldered 
to a bare copper wire, thus constituting a cold junction. The first 
copper wire, and the copper wire soldered to the portion of constantan 
wire forming the cold junction, were again made-up into an insulated 
and braided cable, and led to the recording milli voltmeter, and, when 
in use, the cold junction was inserted into a thermos flask filled with 
melting ice, so as to maintain it at a constant temperature of 0° C. 

(3) A 3Iillivoltmeter. — This is a galvanometer, reading from zero 
to 250° C, and by means of a resistance or multiplying coil inserted 
in circuit, its range could be increased to 500° C. The readings from 
the scale of the millivoltmeter were recorded every half minute, 
during the passage of the biscuit through the oven, and also for some 
time afterwards, to show the continued rise until cooling set in. 
The instrument was calibrated to read correctly at 20° C, its 
temperature-coefficient being about 0'03 per cent, per degree C. — 
this error was practically negligible at the temperature at which the 
instrument was used, and an exact reading was therefore only 
necessary. The thermocouple being inserted into the biscuit, which 
was placed upon the floor of the travelling oven, the flexible cable 
was guided through by an assistant, the moment of exit being care- 
fully noted at the far end. Other biscuits were being baked in the 
same oven, so that the conditions were precisely those of the ordinary 
daily process of baking. 

During baking a certain proportion of the water contained in the 
biscuit is dissipated from the surface, which then becomes hard from 
caramelisation — the remainder of the water, being concentrated in a 
portion about the centre, rises to 100° C, or to a temperature little 
below that point. 

On breaking open a biscuit, immediately after removal from the 
oven, steam issues and the centre is found to be soft and moist. 

It would seem that when any reading exceeds 100° C, the 
temperature registered is that of the actual biscuit-structure and not 
of the contained steam, and that the biscuit-material, which is con- 
veying heat to the water, must necessarily be of a higher temperature 
in order that heat may pass from it to the water — the caramel, or 
hardened portion of the biscuit, could, of course, acquire any tem- 
perature compatible with the surrounding heat by direct conduction. 



Report on Army Biscuits 



In order to destroy the ova of insect pests the lowest temperature 
retained in any part of the biscuit must be regarded as the critical 
one, and in this case readings of not less than 100° C. were obtained 
in the centre of the biscuit. The experiments show that when the 
tip of the thermocouple lay within the moist area, or immediately 
adjacent to it, the temperature was only a little over 100° C, but 
when the tip, on the contrary, lay in tlie hardened portion, a much 
higher temperature was observed, in one case reaching as high as 
125° C. It must be borne in mind that the temperature recorded 
in the later stages of the baking would probably be lower than the

actual temperature attained in the biscuit, since the greater length 
of the wires connecting the tliermocouple to the recording instrument 
would be in the oven, and consequently their temperature would be 
raised — this would result in nn increase of their resistance, and a 
consequent decrease in the current flowing through them, thus giving 
a lower reading. 

The temperature of the oven was determined beforehand, and the 
range is shown in the curve above. 

The highest temperature recorded was 236° C. at the 4th minute, 
at the proximal end of the oven, while, after 18 minutes' baking, 
when a biscuit was removed at the other end of the oven 171° C. 
was refjistered.

Experiment 1. — The temperature gradually rose to 95° C, at 
the 4th minute, and continued rising very slowly -as the water in 
the biscuit was converted into vapour until it reached 100° C. at 
the 21st minute. There was then a rise of about 2°, followed by a 
gradual increase of temperature to 102*5° C. between the 22nd and 
23rd minutes. On removal from the oven, the temperature of the 
biscuit fell and rose again (this was probably due to difficulties in 
manipulation when recovering the biscuit from the oven, but may 
also have been occasioned by draughts of cold air), and when the 
temperature had reached 93° C, gradual cooling set in.

Experiment 3. — The thermocouple was nearer the surface and 
in the portion which was caramelised ; 95° C. was reached between 
the 3rd and 4th minutes. At the 5th minute a temperature of 
99° C. was registered, and no change took place until the 9th minute, 
when a greater increase of temperature per unit of time was 
recorded, 100° C. being attained at 9 -5 minutes. There was then 
a gradual increase in temperature until between the 21st and 22nd- 
minute, when 118° C. was recorded. After the biscuit was removed 
from the oven at 24*5 minutes the temperature rose further to 
124° C. at the 25th minute, and then gradually fell. 

Experiment 4. — The temperature was recorded in a special oven 
designed to bake the biscuit in 12 minutes at a higher temperature. 
Between the 3rd and 4th minutes 95° C. was reached ; there was 
then a gradual further rise, due to the vaporisation of water, 
until a temperature of 100° C. was reached between the 11th and 
12th minutes. The biscuit was baked between the 13th and 14th 
minutes, a temperature of 101° C, being recorded, and when removed 
from the oven at a temperature of 100° C. a gradual fall from that 
point was observed.

EXPEBIMENT 4. 

With regard to the second part of our enquiry : — The lowest 
temperature required to kill the ova of these insects can only be 
ascertained by experiment carried out in the laboratory. 

A few preliminary observations have already been made to test 
methods of procedure and apparatus, and as ova become available 
during the warmer weather, batches will be exposed to different 
temperatures for varying lengths of time. Ova which have been 
exposed to a temperature of 69° C. for 12 minutes have failed to 
survive [as also to 52° C. for 12 minutes. — see footnote]. 

The experiments to record the temperatures occurring within 
the biscuits themselves have shown that by this process of baking, 
a temperature of 95° C. is reached between the 3rd and 4th minutes 
of exposure, with a continued rise to 100° C. in the centre of the 
biscuit, or, in one case, to as much as 105° C, before the biscuit was 
removed at the end of the usual period of baking. 

We are at present unable to state definitely the degree of heat 
necessary to kill the ova of insects, but we think it is very unlikely 
that these ova could withstand such temperatures as are reached 
and maintained during the process of baking.** 

** 60° C. (= 140° P.) may probably be accepted as a maximum temperature above 
which it is unnecessary to go for the destruction of ova, since coagulation of egg- 
albumen takes place at 56° C. {= 132-4° F.), but we should put on record that ova 
of kilhniella exposed to 52° C. (= 126*1° F.) for 12 minutes failed to survive. 



lo Report on Army Biscuits 

We are also of opinion that infestation of the biscuits must take 
place after baking, during cooling, and prior to the tins being 
soldered. 

We have considered the practicability of destroying insect life after 
packing, by puncturing the biscuit-tins before leaving the factory, 
raising the temperature to a lethal point and then finally soldering— 
there are technical difficulties, and also tlie question of added expense. 

Until the temperature destructive to the ova of the motli 
JEphestia huhniclla (which may be considered as also representing 
the otlier species) has been actually determined, the only practical 
suggestions we can offer are that the temperature conditions during 
cooling should be rendered as uncomfortable as possible for the 
moths, by introducing screened cooled air which should be con- 
tinuously withdrawn by revolving fans, suction, or some similar 
contrivance. We think this would more rapidly cool the biscuit, 
and also render it practically impossible for 'the moth to oviposit on 
the biscuits. 

Especial attention should be paid to prevent access of the moth 
to the places where the biscuits are cooled or packed. 

We also suggest that tlie attention of the Board of Agriculture 
should be drawn to the advisability of protecting the Trade by 
scheduling Ephestia kuhniella, Corcyra ceplialoniea, and perhaps other 
species also. 

" Worms" in British Army Biscuits in 1801. — It would appear 
that insect pests have attacked our Army Biscuits for more than 
a hundred years, as shown by Serjeant Daniel Nicol, 92nd (Gordon) 
Highlanders, in his diary of his experiences during the expedition 
to Egypt under Lieut. -General Sir Ealph Abercromby. Writing of 
events in February, 1801, at Marmorice Bay, Asia Minor, where the 
British forces concentrated prior to setting sail for Alexandria, 
Serjeant Nicol writes : — 

" Some vessels were despatched to Maori bay for bullocks, and 
others to Smyrna and Aleppo for bread which was furnished us 
by the Turks, a kind of hard dry husk. We were glad to get this, 
as we were then put on full rations and our biscuits were bad and 
full of worms ; many of our men could only eat them in the 
dakk!" [*'With Napoleon at Waterloo," by Edward Bruce Low, 
edited by MacKenzie MacBride, p. 21 (London: Francis Griffiths, 
34 Maiden Lane, Strand, W.C, 1911).] 

When Ephestia kiihrdella was first observed damaging flour at 



Report on Army Biscuits 1 1 

Halle, in 1877, it was thought that it had been recently introduced 
by commerce from America, and even when notices began to appear 
about its introduction into England (1887-1889) it was still 
suggested that it came with American meal from Mediterranean 
ports — Trieste and Fiume are specially mentioned as the ports from 
which it reached London, In 1889 Miss E. A. Ormerod endeavoured 
to clear up this question of origin by submitting specimens to 
Professor C. V. Riley, of Washington, who replied : " I think I can 
safely say that this species does not occur in the United States." 
{Insect Life 1. 315.) On the strength of this statement, the species, 
which had vaguely been termed " this pest of Mediterranean ports," 
gradually became known as " The Mediterranean Flour-moth," a 
name which perhaps would hardly have been applied to it had 
sufficient attention been called to a subsequent note by Professor 
Ptiley in Insect Life, vol. 2, pp. 166-7 (1889):— 

" It will be remembered that in Insect Life for March (Vol. I., 
p. 315) we published a long letter from Miss Ormerod, in which sh^e 
described the damage done by this pest in England, and that in our 
reply {loc. cit.) we stated that the species does not occur in the 
United States. In the hurry of getting ready to leave for Paris we 
allowed this statement to be made, notwithstanding the fact that we 
had in the National Museum collection for some time specimens of a 
moth indistinguishable from this species from A. W. Latimer, of 
Eufaula, Ala. On referring to our notes we find also that we had 
seen specimens from North Carolina in the collection of M. Eagonot 
in Paris. These facts undoubtedly prove the occurrence of the insect 
in North America for at least some years back. Up to the present 
time the species seems to have been rare here, for every case of 
serious damage to grain by Lepidopterous larvoe which has been 
carefully investigated has shown that the author of the damage was 
either the Angoumois Moth (Gelechia cerealella), the Grain Moth 
( Tinea granella), or E'phestea interpunctella ( = zecc Fitch), a congeneric 
insect which was treated by Dr. Fitch under the common name of 
the ' Indian-meal Moth.' " 

In the American Naturalist for February, 1890 (Vol. 24, p. 200), 
Mr. J. J. Bell wrote :— 

" The Flour Moth. — A new insect pest has recently made its 
appearance on the continent of America. It is known as the flour 
moth (UjjJiestia kiihniella). . . . The flour moth is indigenous to 
the Mediterranean, and a few years ago it would have been likely to 
stay there. But increasing commerce has its attendant dangers. 



12 Report on Army Biscnits 

Experience has shown that as trade in the milling industry enlarges, 
weed and insect pests, confined at one time to a certain locality, 
have spread to places far distant. The flour moth has probably 
come to America with importations of seed wheat, or in bags in 
which flour has been exported, and which before their return may 
have been stored for a time in some place infested by the insect." 

But Ephestia kuhniella had been resident on the continent of 
North America for at least ten years when this was written ! 

In the Biologia Centrali- Americana [Insecta, Lep-Het. 2, p. 286 
(1896)] the late Mr. Herbert Druce recorded Ephestia kuhniella Z. 
from Guatemala, and, under the synonym " gitonella Eagonot, MS.," 
from Mexico and Guatemala, as follows : — 

" 1. Ephestia gitonella.

One specimen, so named by Eagonot. The insect was described^ 
from specimens found at Halle, but it was supposed to have been 
introduced from North America in the larval state in meal. It is 
a destructive pest iii the United States and Canada, as well as in 
Europe." [Druce Biol. C-Am. Ins. Lp-Het. 2. 286 (III. 1896).] 

Two of these records are important, and the data can now be 
given more exactly : 

Guatemala : solola : Panajachel, 5000 feet, 30 December 1880 
(G. C. Champion). 

Mr. Champion has kindly given the following additional informa- 
tion : " The house I stayed in at Panajachel was a flour-mill, on the 
banks of the Lake of Atitlan, some distance from the village. The 
wheat ground there is all grown in the district. G. C. C, 1. IV. 
1913."

Mexico : durango : Ciudad, 8100 feet, and Milpas, 5900 feet, 
[June to September] 1881 {A. Forrer). 

It now becomes manifest that the so-called " Mediterranean " 
Flour-moth, which was first observed in Europe, at Halle in 1877, 
was resident in Guatemala in 1880, in Mexico in 1881, and that 
it occurred in Alabama (at Eufaula, A. W. Latimer) and North 
Carolina (probably 1883, H. K. Morrison) before it reached England 
or Canada. 

It would seem fair to infer that Ephestia kuhniella extended its 
range from Central America through the Southern States north- 
ward, and perhaps reached Europe from a southern port (such as 
New Orleans) before its depredations had been observed and recorded 
in the United States, Certainly one would expect the moth to 
travel with the grain trade toward Europe, rather than (as suggested) 
in empty bags, or sacks, in the opposite direction ! 



The following exact data with reference to the duration of life of 
Ephestia Jciihniella Zeller, were obtained for us by careful observation 
by Mr. Herbert Stringer, during 1912, in the British Museum (Nat. Hist.).

contrasted with Mr. W. G. Johnson's period of fifty-nine days in CaHfornia 
and Illinois, and M. Danysz' period of about two months in France. 

It is only too apparent from these data how rapidly destruction of the 
contents of an infested case of biscuit will be accelerated by removal to a 
hot climate. 

The species of Lepidoptera which most seriously infest Army 
Biscuit are Uphcstia kuhniella Z. and Corcyra ccphalonica Stn., 
but Epkcstia elutella Hb. and Uphestia cautella Wkr. have been 
found almost equally destructive to some samples. It would seem 
that Corcyra ccphalonica is a less serious pest than the Uphestiac, 
for if the percentage of moisture present in the biscuit be con- 
siderably reduced, the young larvae of the Corcyra are imable to 
bite the dry biscuit, and die of starvation — this has not been found 
to be the case with the Ephestiac. 

Apart from shape and general appearance the Corcyra will be 
easily distinguished by the projecting tufts on the head, and by the 
long projecting palpi of the female. The palpi appear to be absent 
in the male, but are in reality appressed to the face and concealed 
in dense scaling — the Ephestiac, on the other hand, have distinct 
ascending palpi in both sexes. These differences are clearly shown 
by the figures, as also the different arrangement of veins in the 
wings, which renders it a matter of no great difficulty to determine 
the genus from dead and badly worn specimens — generic deter- 
mination is easy if the wings are placed on a glass slide and 
moistened with alcohol, when the scales may be removed by an 
ordinary camel-hair pencil. 

Ephestia kuhniella may be briefly described as a pale slaty grey species, 
with an outwardly oblique, indented, dark fuscous, or blackish transverse 
line at one-third, and another, strongly indented inwardly, before the end 
of the wing, the first preceded, and the second followed by a more or less 
clearly indicated pale line ; between these fasciae, beyond the middle of 
the wing, are two blackish discal dots, one above the other, and sometimes 
with some dark scales above and below them ; the hindwings are con- 
spicuously whitish. The Larva of Jciihniella is rather stout, sometimes 
whitish, but generally with a pinkish tint ; the head is shining, chitinous 
bi'ownish, or honey brownish, or even paler ; the pronotal and anal plates 
are somewhat paler than the head ; .spots distinct, with long fine hairs. 
Pupa shining, fuliginous ; enclosed in whitish silken cocoon. 

The larva photographed (19. VIII. 1913) was immersed in absolute alcohol for 
2 hours, and after half-an-hour's interval in strong liquid ammonia (-880) for 
30 minutes. It was then gummed on glass and photographed under electric light — 
this treatment did not kill the larva, which subsequently crawled away and was lost.

Corcyra cephalonica may be briefly described as smoky fuscous, pale 
fuscous, whitish fuscous, or ochraceous, apparently all darker or paler 
tones of the same colour, when darker markings are present these tend to 
arrange themselves longitudinally in the direction of the veins, the dorsal 
margin is always of the pale ground-colour ; sometimes two irregular, 
dentate, darker transverse lines are present (this is the form described 
as translineella Ragonot) ; the hindwings are fuscous in the male, whitish 
fuscous in the female ; the head and the basal joint of the antennae are 
distinctly tufted with long scales, and are of a paler colour than the 
wings. The Larva of cephalonica is dull whitish, the spots inconspicuous, 
but indicated by long fine hairs ; the head is shining, pitchy, or honey 
brownish ; pronotal plates slightly paler, the anal plate small, still paler. 
The yellowish olivaceous pupa is enclosed in a somewhat dense silky 
whitish cocoon.

Antennae whitish fuscous ; basal joint with some darker fuscous scales. 
Head and Thorax very pale fuscous, sometimes whitish fuscous, or darker 
fuscous. Forewings very pale fuscous, the veins more or less indicated by 
darker fuscous scaling, and with a tendency to suffusion over the whole 
wing, except along the dorsum which remains of the pale ground-colour ; 
in some specimens the darker markings are almost absent, in others there 
is a tendency to form two irregular transverse dark lines, one at the end 
of the cell, the other at about half the wing-length, with some dark 
shading towards the base ; a more or less distinct dark spot occurs on the 
margin at the end of each vein ; cilia pale fuscous, with some admixture 
of darker scales. Exj). al. 14-24 mm. Hindwings, $ fuscous ; 9 shining

This would appear to be a species of Eastern origin, introduced into 
Europe, and elsewhere, by the rice-trade ; it was thought to be specially 
attached to currants, but it is imported to this country freely with 
Rangoon rice which seems to be its natural food ; there seems little doubt 
that anything that will satisfy an Ephestia will be equally nourishing to 
Corcyra.

ARMY BISCUIT ENQUIRY: SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES. 

By J. HARTLEY DURRANT^ F.E.S., Brit. Mus. (Nat. Hist.), 



Lieutenant-Colonel W. W. 0. BEVERIDGE, D.S.O., 
Royal Army Medical Corps. 

{Continued from Vol. 20. p. 634.) 

For practical purposes it has been necessary to ascertain the exact 
average dimensions of the ova of Ephestia kuhniella Z., and Major S. Lyle 
Cummins, R.A.M.C., has kindly furnished us with the following careful 
measurements : —

From these measurements it would appear that if, when screening 
flour, a mesh of 160 strands to the inch be relied upon to eliminate the 
ova of kuhniella, such reliance must rest on the assumption that the ova 
of this moth always approach the screen broadside-on.

Major J. G. McNaught, R.A.M.C. [Journal op the Royal Army 
Medical Corps, vol. 21. p. 136 (1913)] quotes from MM. Lemoine and 
Decaux, that Ephestia elutella Hb., Plodia interpunctella Hb., and Pyralis 
farinalis L. " only frequent the cases of biscuits from the end of May to 
the beginning of September : hence the indication to pack the biscuits 
only in the intervening period of the year." A similar suggestion was 
fully discussed during this Enquiry, at Woolwich, in November, 1911. 
Apart from the possibility of placing contracts at any specified date, or 
dates, a reference to this Journal, vol. 20. p. 627, will demonstrate that, 
so far as Ephestia Mhniella is concerned, such immunity can hardly be 
hoped for during the winter months, since moths are recorded as emerging 
in September, October, and November, and they continue to emerge 
plentifully in December, January, etc. ; in fact, the species seems to be 
normally an autumnal insect.

" To the Editor of the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps. 

" Sir, — In making the measui*ements of ova of Ephestia Jcuhniella 
mentioned in the Journal of February, 1914 ('Army Biscuit Enquiry: 
Supplementary Notes' by J. Hartley Durrant, F.E.S., and Lt.-Col. 
W. W. O. Beveridge, D.S.O., R.A.M.C), a micrometer was used which, 
in the absence of numbers on the scale, was thought to be graduated in 
tenths of a millimetre. On continuing the measurements with a fresh 
series of eggs and checking the results with a recently purchased micro- 
meter scale, the instrument previously used was discovered to be in 
twentieths, not tenths, and the calculations have to be raised accordingly. 
The true measurements of the eggs is 0"58 by 0*31 mm., which lends still 
more point to Lt.-Col. Beveridge's conclusion that the screening of flour 
with a mesh of 160 strands to the inch cannot be relied on to eliminate 
the eggs of Ephestia hiihniella. 

I am, etc.,
