SOUPS. 

White Stock.— 1. 

One pint soaked haricot beans, three pints water, one 
large carrot, one large onion, one large turnip, a little 
celery, one ounce butter, one teaspoonful salt, a very small 
quantity each of mixed herbs, mace and pepper-corns. 
Dissolve the butter in a saucepan, add the beans, vege- 
tables sliced, the seasonings and water ; boil all together 
for two and a half hours. Strain. 

Brown Stock.— 2, 

Four pounds of the shin of beef, four young carrots, 
four Bermuda onions, one small turnip, one-half head of 
celery, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful 
of white pepper-corns, one-half teaspoonful of black 
pepper-corns. First, cutting all the meat from the bone, 
remove the marrow, and break up the bone with a 
hammer. Put the meat and bone together in a large 
saucepan, and pour over these five pints of cold water, 
placing the saucepan over the fire. Bring the water 
now quickly to the boiling point and skim off, when 
boiling, all of the scum that rises to the surface. Throw 
into the saucepan then the salt, which will bring any 
remaining to the top ; when, skimming once more, add 
to the contents of the pan the carrot, turnip and celery, 
all cut into very small pieces. Before adding the onion, 
blanch it with boiling water, to draw from it the green- 



— lO — 

ness which produces indigestion; having done which, 
put it together with the pepper-corns into the saucepan 
and allow all again to boil. When this is done, draw the 
saucepan to the side of the fire, cover it closely, and 
allow its contents to simmer slowly for five hours, at 
the end of which time the stock should be strained 
through a clean towel to remove the meat and vegetables, 
the juices and flavors of which have been extracted, and 
put away to cool for future use. 

Soup Stock. — 3. 

Two pounds coarse lean beef, chopped almost as fine 
as sausage-meat; one pound of lean veal, also chopped; 
two pounds of bones (beef, veal or mutton), cracked in 
several places ; half or three stalks of celery, when you 
can get it ; five quarts of cold water. 

Consomme a la Royale.— 4. 

Beat up the yolks of two eggs with a tablespoonful of 
clear soup, pour it into a greased basin, cover the top 
and steam it twenty minutes. Cut it into squares, throw 
them into a soup tureen among clear soup, and serve 
hot. 

Vermicelli Soup.— 5. 

Two quarts clear soup, one-fourth pound vermicelli, 
one teacupful tomato puree. Put the soup in a bright 
saucepan to boil ; crush the vermicelli and put it into 
boiling salted water to boil for five minutes, drain it, and 
add it with the tomato puree to the soup; allow it to boil ; 
season with pepper and salt, and serve. 



II — 



Vegetable Soup.— 6. 

An excellent soup can be made solely from vegetables 
as follows : Take the heart of a pretty large cabbage, a 
good-sized carrot, one-half pound of onions, one break- 
fast-cupful of green peas, a couple of parsnips, and two 
or three golden ball turnips. Wash and clean all these 
vegetables thoroughly, cut and mince the roots into very 
small dice, and put into a clean pot of boiling water and 
boil till the vegetables are all tender ; add a little parsley 
a quarter of an hour before dishing. Do not put in salt 
or pepper till the soup is about to go on the table; add 
more peas if desired, and have some slices of toasted 
bread cut into half-inch pieces for those who like it 
among their soup. All vegetables should be well 
boiled, and this soup should not be too thick of vege- 
tables. Put in the turnip first, then the chopped carrot 
— a portion of the carrot should be grated. This soup 
will take about two hours to make ready. 

Ox-TaU Soup.— 7. 

Three ox tails will make a large tureenfull of soup. 
Desire the butcher to divide them at the joints. Rub 
them with salt, and put them to soak in warm water, 
while you prepare the vegetables. Put into a large pot 
or stewpan four onions peeled and quartered, a bunch of 
parsley, two sliced carrots, two sliced turnips and two 
dozen pepper-corns. Then put in the tails, and pour on 
three quarts of water. Cover the pot and set it on hot 
coals by the side of the fire. Keep it gently simmering 
for about three hours, supplying it well with fresh, hot 
coals. Skim it carefully. When the meat is quite ten- 



12 

der, and falls from the bones, strain the soup into another 
pot, and add to it a spoonful of mushroom catchup, and 
two spoonfuls of butter nibbed in flour. You may 
thicken it also with the pulp of a dozen onions first fried 
soft and then rubbed through a colander. After it is 
thickened, let it just boil up, and then send it to table, 
with small squares of toasted bread in the tureen. 

Veal Soup.— 8. 

To about three pounds of a joint of veal, which must 
be well broken up, put four quarts of water and set it 
over to boil. Prepare one-fourth pound of macaroni by 
boiling it by itself, with sufficient water to cover it ; add 
a little butter to the macaroni when it is tender ; strain 
the soup and season to taste with salt and pepper; then 
add the macaroni in the water in which it is boiled. 
The addition of a pint of rich milk or cream and celery 
flavor is relished by many. 

Barley Broth.— 9. 

Six-pound leg of beef or knuckle of veal, one-half 
pound pearl barley, two quarts of cold water, two large 
onions, one small bunch of sweet herbs, one teaspoonful 
of chopped parsley, one head of celery, two turnips cut 
into squares, one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful 
of black pepper. Simmer this all together for two hours, 
removing the scum carefully ; then add two more quarts 
of hot water very gradually, and continue to simmer for 
two hours longer. Take out the meat, and skim off" the 
fat. Do not strain the broth ; send it to table with the 
vegetables and barley in it. 



— 13 — 

Clam Soup.— 10. 

One quart, or two dozen, clams. Strain off the liquor 
and chop them fine. Add two quarts of boiling water 
and let all boil slowly for two hours in a porcelain kettle. 
Add two tablespoonfuls of butter, creamed with an equal 
amount of flour. Let it boil up once and add pepper 
and salt to taste. When ready to serve, add the yolks of 
two eggs, well beaten, and mixed with a pint of fresh 
milk. Do not boil after the eggs and milk are in. 

Potato Soup. — 11. 

One pound bone or a small piece of dripping, four or 
five potatoes, two pints water, one onion, one-half carrot, 
pepper and salt. Wash the potatoes, peel them thinly, 
cut them in small pieces; wash the bone; put it and the 
potatoes into a pot; add the water. Peel and scald the 
onion, cut it in pieces, add it to the soup, also a little 
salt. Let it boil ; skim well. Grate the carrot, add it to 
the soup. Let all boil for one and a half hours, then 
add a little pepper, and more salt if necessary. 

Cabbage Soup. — 12. 

Wash and trim a fine young cabbage with a good 
white heart, cut the leaves into fine shreds, and boil them 
until tender in a quart of water. Add the cabbage and 
the water in which it was boiled to a quart of good 
broth (the liquor in which mutton or pork has been 
boiled, or, indeed, any fresh pot liquor answers well), 
season with pepper and salt, and just before serving stir 
in an ounce of fresh butter and two lumps of sugar. 
The cabbage should be in sufficient quantity to make 
the soup thick. 



— 14 — 

Hodge-Podge.— 13. 

Take the neck and back ribs of mutton ; put them in 
a pan with a teacupful of pearl barley ; fill up the pan 
with cold water, put it on the stove, and boil it until the 
meat is done ; take it out and put away for use. Strain 
through a sieve ; skim off the fat, and return the stock 
into the pan ; put it back on the stove. Wash a few 
carrots and turnips ; peel and cut them in dice ; add to 
the soup a few young onions, cauliflower, two heads of 
lettuce, peas, beans and a little parsley. Boil all the 
vegetables till quite tender; then take some lamb or 
mutton chops, fry them a light-brown color, and put 
them into the soup-pot; skim off all the fat; add a little 
salt to taste, and dish, 

Tomato Soup. — 14. 

Add a quart of raw tomatoes peeled and sliced, or a 
can of stewed tomatoes, and half a small onion to a 
quart of stock, and stew slowly one hour. Strain and 
rub through a colander and set again over the fire. Stir 
in a tablespoonful of butter cut up and rubbed into a 
tablespoonful of flour. A tablespoonful of corn-starch 
wet up in the cold water. Season to taste with pepper 
and salt, boil once more and pour out. 

Celery Cream. — 15. 

Cook four or five heads of celery with a small onion 
in a stewpanful of boiling water, and when tender rub it 
all through a sieve ; dilute it with some of the water in 
which it was boiled, season to taste, let it boil up, then 
stir in (off the fire) the yolks of two eggs beaten up with 
a gill of cream, and serve. Chicory can be treated in 
the same way. 



— IS — 

Chicken Soup.— 16. 

Cut up the chicken, cut each joint, and let it boil an 
hour ; make dumplings of a pint of milk, an egg, a little 
salt, and flour stirred in till quite stiff; drop this in, a 
spoonful at a time, while it is boiling; stir in a little 
thickening, with enough pepper, salt and parsley to 
season the whole ; let it boil a few minutes longer, and 
take it up in a tureen. Chopped celery is a great im- 
provement to chicken soup. 

Tomato Bisque.— 17. 

One can of tomatoes. Let them come to a boil, pass 
through a colander, then through a fine strainer. Put 
back in the pot, add a small teaspoonful of bread soda to 
the tomatoes, stir in one tablespoonful of corn-starch or 
cracker powdered very fine, moistened to a paste with a 
little water. One quart of rich new milk : let it come to 
a boil, then stir into the tomatoes ; add one teaspoonful 
of sugar, and salt. 

Soubise Soup. — 18. 

One and a half pints of water, half a pint of milk, one 
and a half ounces of butter, two onions, five ounces of 
bread, the yolks of one or two eggs or one gill of cream, 
pepper and salt to taste. Cut the bread into very thin 
slices, boil it in the water and milk, with the onions 
thinly sliced; add the butter, pepper and salt; when 
thoroughly stewed to a pulp, rub through a wire sieve. 
Now set it again on the fire, and let it simmer for a few 
minutes, and just before sending it to table add the cream 
or the yolks of eggs. 



— i6 — 

Mock Turtle Soup.— 19. 

Take a calf s head, and remove the skin by soaking it 
for a couple of hours in cold water. When thoroughly- 
cleansed, put the head into a large saucepan, pour on 
cold water sufficient to cover, and place on a moderate 
fire till it boils. Now take off the lid and remove the 
scum. Let the soup simmer gently for seven hours, or 
until the bone and meat separate, when strain off 
through a clean towel and set aside till quite cold. The 
grease will now have come to the surface, and must be 
carefully removed. Replace the soup on a slow fire for 
five minutes; again set aside to cool ; add a little sweet 
herb, a shred of celery, the peel of half a lemon, the 
whisked whites and crushed shells of two eggs. Pour 
the mixture from one saucepan to another, which greatly 
helps the process of clearing ; replace on a fire, allowing 
the whole to boil ; then let it settle for a few minutes, 
after which strain through another clean towel. Before 
serving, add sufficient " browning," salt to taste. Have 
ready in the tureen some thin slices of the soup-meat and 
tongue, on which pour the boiling soup. 

Asparagus Soup. — 20. 

Three or four pounds of veal cut fine, a little salt 
pork, two or three bunches of asparagus, three quarts 
of water, one pint of milk. Boil one-half of the aspar- 
agus with the meat, leaving the rest in water until about 
twenty minutes before serving; add the milk, thicken 
with a little flour, and season. The soup should boil 
about three hours before adding the last half of the 
asparagus. 



— 17 — 

Ox-Tail Soup in Baking-Pan.— 21. 

Divide two ox tails, wash them well in cold water, 
then put them in the pan, with three teaspoonfuls of 
salt, one of pepper, four cloves, a little thyme, if handy, 
two good onions ; add three quarts of water, two table- 
spoonfuls of coloring ; put on the cover, place it in a 
moderate oven for three hours to simmer, take off the 
fat (which save for use), and serve. Haifa pound of any 
vegetable, mixed or not, cut in dice, can be added with 
advantage. 

Brown Turkey Soup. — 22. 

Use for this soup the carcass of a cold roast turkey ; 
cut all the scraps of meat from it, and mince them fine ; 
mince also any bits of heart, liver or gizzard which may 
be available; put two tablespoonfuls of butter in the 
soup-kettle, and set it over the fire to get smoking hot ; 
peel and slice an onion, and when the butter is hot add 
the onion to it, together with the minced turkey-meat 
and any cold stuffing on hand, and let all these ingredi- 
ents brown together; when they are brown, stir among 
them two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour and let that 
brown ; then pour in four quarts of boiling water, add 
two teaspoonfuls of salt and a level saltspoonful of 
pepper. Stir the soup thoroughly, put in the carcass of 
the turkey without breaking it, cover the soup-kettle, 
and let the soup cook slowly for at least two hours; 
then remove the carcass of the turkey, and serve the 
soup hot, with all the other ingredients in it. A glass 
of wine poured into the tureen containing the soup is a 
great addition to it when the flavor of wine is liked, but 
the soup is excellent without it. 



— i8 — 

Cream of Onion Soup.— 23. 

Peel and slice thinly six white onions, put them in the 
soup-kettle with one tablespoonful of butter, and cook 
for ten minutes without browning. Add one quart of 
water, one pint of milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of white pepper, a pinch of mace 
and one-half teaspoonful of sugar. Cook slowly for 
one hour, then rub through a puree sieve. Return to 
the fire, add one teaspoonful of corn-starch dissolved in 
a little cold water, and bring again to the boiling point. 
Cook two minutes, then draw to the side of the fire and 
stir in the beaten yolks of three eggs, mixed with one 
cupful of cream. Take immediately from the fire and 
serve with croutons of fried bread. 

Vegetable Soup. — 24. 
One-third cupful of carrot, one-third cupful of turnip, 
one-half cupful of celery, one and one-half cupfuls of 
potato, one-half onion, one quart water, five tablespoonfuls 
butter, one-half tablespoonful finely chopped parsley, salt 
and pepper. Wash and scrape a small carrot; cut in quar- 
ters lengthwise; cut quarters in thirds lengthwise; cut 
strips thus made in thin slices crosswise. Wash and pare 
half a turnip, and cut and slice same as carrot. Wash, pare, 
and cut potatoes in small pieces. Wash and scrape 
celery and cut in quarter-inch pieces. Prepare vegetables 
before measuring. Cut onion in thin slices. Mix 
vegetables (except potatoes), and cook ten minutes 
in four tablespoonfuls butter, stirring constantly. Add 
potatoes, cover, and cook two minutes. Add water, and 
boil one hour. Beat with spoon or fork to break 
vegetables. Add remaining butter and parsley. Season 
with salt and pepper, 



FISH AND OYSTERS. 

Baked Ood.— 25. 

One and one-half pounds cod, one teacupful bread 
crumbs, one dessertspoonful chopped parsley, one tea- 
spoonful dripping or butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, a 
little pepper, one teacupful milk, a little flour, one egg. 
Wash the cod, take off the fins, or skin it, which is better. 
A middle cut is preferable, where the opening of the 
stomach is. Dry the fish well outside and inside. Rub 
together the bread and dripping ; add the parsley, salt 
and pepper ; moisten the whole with the egg beaten up, 
and fill the opening in the stomach with the mixture. 
Dust the fish over with a little flour, and put it in a 
pudding dish ; put in one teacupful of milk, and put the 
butter all over the top in little bits. Put it in the oven 
to bake about half an hour, basting it with the milk now 
and again. Fish contains gelatine, fibrine, albumen, and 
phosphorus. Take out the fish on a hot dish, and pour 
the sauce round it. This is a most nutritious dish of 
fish, seeing that all the substance is retained, making it 
both light and nourishing. 

Baked Pike.— 26. 

First draw, scale and wash the pike thoroughly ; truss 
it in the form of an S ; put it in a baking-dish with a 
little stock, a good piece of fresh butter, two tablespoon- 
fuls of catchup, a little anchovy and some chopped 



20 

parsley and shallot. Set the pike in the oven to bake 
until it is done, remembering it must be frequently- 
basted with its own liquor, and that the heat of the oven 
must not be fierce, as in that case it would burn up the 
moisture and spoil the fish. When thoroughly done 
through, lift the pike carefully on the dish, strain the 
liquor it has been baked with into a stewpan, thicken it 
with two ounces of butter kneaded with two ounces of 
flour, add a few sliced gherkins and a glass of sherry. 
Stir the sauce over the fire for ten minutes, pour it over 
the fish, and send to table. Pike may be plain boiled, 
same as haddock, and served with plain butter sauce, 
anchovy or Dutch sauce. Pike may also be filleted, 
egged, bread-crumbed and fried, same as other white 
fish, and served with Dutch or anchovy sauce. 

Bluefish Baked Whole.— 27. 
Choose a medium-sized bluefish ; have it drawn from 
the gills to avoid splitting it; wash it in cold salted 
water, and stuff it with the following force-meat : Soak a 
pint of stale bread in cold water, and squeeze out the 
water when the bread is soft; meanwhile chop fine a 
small onion, two tablespoonfuls of parsley, and a tea- 
spoonful of fresh thyme, savory or sweet marjoram ; 
put these ingredients into a frying-pan with a table- 
spoonful of butter over the fire until they are smoking 
hot. Use this force-meat for stuffing the fish. On the 
bottom of a dripping-pan put half a pound of salt pork, 
cut in slices ; lay the fish on the pork, season it highly 
with salt and pepper, and put it into a hot oven to bake. 
Let it cook until it is nicely browned and the skin 
begins to crack. A medium-sized fish will cook in 



21 — 

about an hour. Change the fish from the pan to a hot 
platter, lay the pork on it ; serve it as soon as it is done. 
Bluefish is excellent either fried or boiled. 

Baked Halibut.— 28. 

Three or four pounds of halibut Dip the dark skin 
in boiling water, and scrape clean. Rub well with salt 
and pepper. Put it into a clean pan, and pour milk over 
it till half an inch deep. Bake about an hour, basting 
with the milk. Remove the bone and skin, and arrange 
on the platter in the original form. Serve with plain 
drawn butter, egg sauce or cream sauce, and garnish 
with slices of boiled eggs. The milk keeps the fish 
moist, is a good substitute for pork, and makes the fish 
brown better. Use just enough milk to baste, and let it 
cook away toward the last, or sprinkle buttered crumbs 
over the top when the fish is nearly done, and serve 
with tomato sauce. A large cod, or any whole fish too 
large for a small family, may be cooked as follows : 
Remove the skin and bones from the middle and 
thickest part ; stuff and bake, Use the bones and head 
for a chowder. Cut the tail piece into slices, salt well, 
and fry or broil them. Or crimp them by soaking in 
salted water ; then simmer in water with salt and lemon 
juice, and serve cold with Tartar sauce. 

Baked Shad.— 29. 

Choose the very finest for this purpose, and, besides 
the usual cleaning, remove the backbone if the fish be 
male, and roe if it be female ; in the cavities thus formed, 
insert a rich stuiifing of bread crumbs, seasoned exactly 
as if you were preparing to roast poultry. As at the 



— 22 — 

season for shad eggs are also plentiful, it will improve 
this stuffing to add to it one or two eggs, beaten light, 
and incorporate with the other things. When the fish 
is well stuffed, cover it all over on top with grated bread 
crumbs, glazed with some of the egg kept out on 
purpose; place it at full length in a baking-pan con- 
taining about a pint of water ; baste it with butter from 
time to time, and let it bake gently till done through. 
Broil the roe, and serve it in a dish separately, and 
placed conveniently, so that each person at table may 
be helped to a bit. Unless where persons are fond of 
very rich food, no gravy is needed with baked shad. If 
called for, though, prepare some out of the juice li;ft in the 
pan where the fish was baked, adding a little water, and 
thickening with butter and browned flour. Serve in the 
usual gravy-boat. 

Fish Cakes.— 30. 

One small cooked haddock or a small piece of cooked 
cod, three potatoes, one teaspoonful of flour, two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, a 
little pepper and salt. Wash, peel and boil the potatoes ; 
put them in a basin, beat them till smooth. Remove 
the skin and bones from the fish, break it in small pieces, 
mix it with the potatoes, add pepper and salt to taste. 
Put the flour on a plate, mix the milk with it ; put the 
bread crumbs on a piece of paper. Make the fish and 
potato into small, round cakes, cover them with a little 
dry flour, brush them with the flour and milk. Toss 
them into the bread crumbs ; fry them in plenty of hot, 
clarified fat or dripping, in the same manner as fried fish. 



— 23 — 

Boiled. Salmon. — 31. 

Salmon should be perfectly fresh and hand-led as little 
as possible. Have plenty of boiling water pretty well 
tasted with salt. Skim it carefully. If the fish is not 
newly caught, add one-half teacupful of vinegar. Let 
the salmon boil the necessary time, skimming carefully 
as long as any scum rises, and then remove the fish 
kettle from the fire, and let the fish remain in the water 
for twenty minutes. This improves salmon, but no 
other fish. Then drain it on the drainer, and serve on a 
napkin with salad and Tartar sauce. The time salmon 
requires to boil is as follows : — 

A slice weighing i lb. requires 15 minutes. 

2 lbs. " 20 " 

" " s " from a thick fish, 30 " 

" " 5 " from a small fish, 25 " 

A whole fish weighing 8 lbs. requires 30 " 

Fried Smelts.— 32. 

Dip them in milk for a few minutes, drain them, flour 
them well on both sides, and fry a pale gold color. 
Serve with any sauce liked. 

Mackerel -with Black Butter. — 33. 

Take the mackerel and soak it for a couple of hours 
in oil, season it with pepper and salt, and then broil it, 
basting with oil. For sauce, melt a tablespoonful of 
butter in a frying-pan till quite hot, fry some parsley in 
it and a tablespoonful of vinegar and two of stock ; boil 
up and pour over the mackerel, and serve very hot. 



— 24 — 

Small Fish.— 34. 
Put in a deep pan four teaspoonfuls of onions, 
chopped, half a pint of melted butter, a gill of vinegar; 
lay over six pounds of any common fish, season over 
with two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of pepper ; place it in 
the oven for twenty minutes, then turn it, baste it with 
the sauce now and then ; dish it up, and pour sauce over, 
or serve in the pan. If the sauce should be too thin, boil 
on the fire till it gets of a thickish substance. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel.— 35. 

When cleaned, freshen theni in a gallon of cold water 
over night. In the morning, pour off the water, drain, 
and soak them one hour in milk enough to cover them. 
Before broiling, drain them and wipe dry. Put them 
into a wire broiler and proceed as for fresh mackerel. 
Or, bake them in a moderate oven, and to two mackerel 
allow a cupful of milk. Bake in the milk. Some think 
this an improvement on fried or broiled salt mackerel. 

Soused Mackerel.— 36. 
Two mackerel, one-half pint vinegar, a few bay 
leaves, one gill liquor in which the fish was boiled, 
pepper and salt. After the mackerel have been boiled, 
remove the heads and skin, split them open, and take 
away the backbones. Lay one of the fish into a deep 
dish, and season it well with pepper and salt and bay 
leaves ; lay the other fish on the top of it, and season again. 
Mix together the liquor and vinegar, pour them over 
the fish, and set the dish aside in a cool place. This is 
an excellent luncheon or supper dish, and will keep good 
for many days. 



— 25 — 

Pish Entree— 37. 

Free two pounds of any white fish from bonos and skin, 
chop fine, then rub through a sieve. Put in a mortar 
with four ounces of butter and two ounces of bread 
crumbs, and pound until well mixed. Season with 
pepper, salt and nutmeg, add three raw egg yolks, beat 
well, then add two whole eggs. When thoroughly 
mixed add one tablespoonful of thick cream and the 
juice of a lemon. Turn out on a floured board, divide 
into twelve parts, form into oval cakes, dip in beaten 
egg, then in bread crumbs, and fry in butter. Dish them 
in a circle, filling the center with cooked mushrooms, and 
serve with a lemon sauce. 

Twin Soles.— 38. 

Take the fillets from flounder or bass, freed from skin 
and bone; or use two thin half-inch slices of halibut, cut 
from below the middle, and remove the two fillets or 
sections of fish from each side of the backbone. Strip 
ofl" the skin, season with salt and pepper, lay the fillets 
in fine buttered cracker crumbs until crumbed all over. 
On half of the fillets put a mixture of fine chopped 
onion, olives, pickles and parsley, enough to cover ; lay 
the other fillets on top, being careful to have them fit 
perfectly, and press them together firmly. Put into a 
baking-pan a thin slice of fat salt pork for each pair of 
fillets, lay them on the pork, pour over them a little 
melted butter, and bake about twenty minutes or until 
brown. Remove to a hot platter, and garnish with sliced 
lemon and parsley. 



— 26 — 

Fried Perch.— 39. 

Perch is a fresh-water fish, abounding in rivers, lakes 
and ponds. They are clad with scales and fins. Clean, 
and dry them well in a cloth ; then roll them in salted 
meal. Fry them in plenty of sweet drippings. Serve 
them quickly, with crisp parsley. 

Baked Rock-fish..— 40. 

Rub the fish with salt, black pepper and a dust of 
cayenne, inside and out ; prepare a stuffing of bread and 
butter, seasoned with pepper, salt, parsley and thyme ; 
mix an egg in it, fill the fish with this, and sew it up or 
tie a string around it; put it in a deep pan or oval oven, 
and bake it as you would a fowl. To a large fish add 
half a pint of water ; you can add more for the gravy if 
necessary ; dust flour over and baste it with butter. 
Any other fresh fish can be baked in the same way. 
A large one will bake slowly in an hour and a half, small 
ones in half an hour. 

Baked Black Bass.— 41. 

Eight good-sized onions chopped fine, half that 
quantity of bread crumbs, butter the size of a hen's egg, 
plenty of pepper and salt ; mix thoroughly with anchovy 
sauce until quite red. Stuff your fish with this compound 
and pour the rest over it, previously sprinkling it with a 
little red pepper. Shad, pickerel and trout are good the 
same way. Tomatoes can be used instead of anchovies 
and are more economical. If using them, take pork in 
place of butter, and chop fine. 



— 27 — 

Boiled Trout.— 42. 

Put a handful of salt into the water. When it boils, 
put in the trout. Boil them fast about twenty minutes, 
according to their size. For the sauce, send with them 
melted butter, and put some soy into it, or flavor it 
with catchup. 

Fried Herring.— 43. 

Clean them well, dry them, dip them in flour, brush 
them over with hot, clarified fat, toss them into oatmeal, 
fry in hot fat a nice brown. 

PUlets of Haddock with Tomato Sauce.— 44. 

Put one pound of tomatoes into a saucepan with one 
ounce of butter, cover the pan, and simmer till soft; 
then rub them through a sieve. Mix with the pulp a cup- 
ful of good stock and a few drops of lemon juice and 
a tablespoonful of minced parsley, pepper and salt to 
taste. Lay the fillets of haddock in this sauce and cook 
them over the fire till done. When laid in the dish, garnish 
with little heaps of potato balls cooked in milk. 

Escaloped Oysters. — 45. 

Take a quart of oysters, strain and clean them ; then 
place a layer of oysters in a dish, season slightly with 
pepper and salt, cover with bread or cracker crumbs 
and some of the oyster juice, repeating the process until 
the dish is full. Take three eggs, beat light, and stir 
into a pint of fresh milk and pour over the oysters, 
taking care to have the top layer of crumbs. Bake in a 
quick oven about twenty minutes. Serve in the same 
dish. 



— 28 — 

Fried Oysters.~46. 

Take twelve to fourteen oysters, open them carefully, 
and put by the liquor for them ; put them into a stewpan 
over the fire in a little v/ater to blanch for a few minutes 
(if there is enough liquor to warm them in, it is better 
than water); take out the oysters, keep the liquor, 
beard the oysters and lay them on a sieve, then on to a 
cloth to dry. Break a fresh egg on a plate, beat well 
with a fork ; have about a quarter of a pound of bread 
crumbs, to which has been added a spoonful of chopped 
parsley, a grate of nutmeg, and a little pepper, and dust 
of cayenne. Dip each oyster first in the egg, then in 
the bread crumbs. Put them into a small wire basket, 
fry for one minute in very hot lard. 

Pigs in Blankets. — 47. 

Select large, plump oysters, roll each in a thin slice of 
fresh bacon, skewered with a wooden toothpick ; place 
them in a pan singly with a little butter, pepper and 
salt; let them remain in the oven until thoroughly 
heated, not baked, and serve just as they are, using the 
sticks as a handle. When once tasted, pigs in blankets 
will prove a toothsome morsel never to be forgotten. 

Macaroni with Oysters. — 48. 

Boil macaroni in salt water, after which drain through 
a colander ; take a deep earthen dish or tin, put in 
alternate layers of macaroni and oysters, sprinkle the 
layers of macaroni with grated cheese, bake until 
brown. Delicious as a side dish at dinner. 



— 29 — 

Panned Oysters. — i9. 

Drain the oysters from the liquor ; put them in a hot 
pan or spider; as soon as they begin to curl, add butter, 
pepper and salt. Serve on toast, or without, if preferred. 

01am Fritters.— 50. 

Two dozen clams, one egg, one cup milk, two small 
cups flour (or enough for thin batter), salt and pepper. 
Chop the clams fine, and stir them into the batter made 
of the milk, clam liquor, beaten eggs and the flour. 
Season to taste, and fry by the spoonful in very hot lard. 

Boiled Grabs. — 51. 

Put the crabs into a large kettle with about one quart 
of hot salted water to a kettleful of crabs and let them 
steam twenty minutes. Put a cover over the kettle and 
on it a weight, in order that the steam may not escape. 
Then take them out, wipe them clean, and if the backs 
can be easily removed, they are done ; if not, steam them 
longer. Then take off the small claws, the backs, and 
all between the backs and the inner shell, and throw 
them away. The large claws may be cracked and sent 
to the table with the rest of the crabs when picked. 

Deviled Crabs.- 52. 

Two dozen crabs, nicely picked, one-half pound melted 
butter, one teacupful of sweet oil, one-third teacupful of 
cayenne pepper, one-half teaspoonful of mustard (made), 
one-half teacupful of Worcestershire sauce,one-half table- 
spoonful of celery seed, four eggs, two handfuls of 
cracker dust. Mix well, fill your shells, sprinkle them 
with cracker dust, and bake a light brown. 



— 30 — 

Escaloped Lobster. — 53. 
Strain the liquor from a tin of preserved lobster into 
a basin, mix with it two tablespoonfuls of fine flour, and 
stir into it a gill of boiling water. Put this into a 
stewpan with an ounce of fresh butter, and stir until 
thick ; add a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy, and a 
pinch of cayenne pepper; pick any bits of shell or 
cartilage from the lobster, and add it to the sauce. 
Butter a tin dish ; put in it a thick layer of bread crumbs 
and on this the lobster; cover with a thick layer of 
crumbs, spread bits of butter thickly on the top, and 
bake in a quick oven for fifteen minutes. 

Chowder. — 64. 
Take a half a pound of salt pork, and having half 
boiled it, cut it into slips, and with some of them cover 
the bottom of a pot. Then strew on some sliced onion. 
Have ready a large fresh cod, or an equal quantity of 
haddock, tautog or any firm fish. Cut the fish into 
large pieces, and lay part of it on the pork and onions. 
Season it with pepper. Then cover it with a layer of 
biscuits, or crackers that have been previously soaked in 
milk or water. You may add also a layer of sliced 
potatoes. Next proceed with a second layer of pork, 
onions, fish, etc., and continue as before till the pot is 
nearly full, finishing with soaked crackers. Pour in 
about a pint and a half of cold water. Cover it close, 
set it on hot coals, and let it simmer about an hour. 
Then skim it, and turn it out into a deep dish. Leave 
the gravy in the pot till you have thickened it with a bit 
of butter rolled in flour, and some chopped parsley. 
Then give it one boil-up, and pour it hot into the dish. 
Chowder is made of clams, first cutting off the hard part. 



MEAT AND FOWL. 

Rules for Baking Meat. — 56. 

In baking meat, there are two or three points which 
should be most carefully attended to. The oven should 
be well ventilated and kept perfectly clean. The baking- 
tin must also be scrupulously clean ; any juice from fruit 
or meat gravy which has been spilled in the oven or on 
the baking-tin, and not removed, will burn and give an 
unpleasant taste to the meat. The baking-tin, if possible, 
should be a double one. For the first half-hour, the 
oven should be hot, afterwards it must be kept at a 
moderate heat. If this is not done, the outside of the 
meat will scorch and dry up before the inside is cooked. 
The basting should be as constant as when the meat is 
roasted. The oven should be made hot again at the 
finish to insure the surface being nice and crisp. The 
common fault in baking is to have the oven too hot, and 
then the meat gets dried up and wasted. As a general 
rule, twenty minutes to the pound will not be too long if 
the oven is at the right temperature, but all the con- 
ditions mentioned in the rules for roasting must be taken 
into consideration. Always put the meat on the trivet ; 
do not let it soak in its own fat. Gravy is made as for 
roasted meat. 

Boiled Corned Beef.— 56. 
Lay in clean cold water for five or six hours when 
you have washed off all the salt. Wipe and put it into 



— 32 — 

a pot and cover deep in cold water. Boil gently twenty- 
five minutes per pound. When done, take the pot from 
the fire and set it in the sink with the meat in it, while you 
make the sauce. Strain a large cupfial of the liquor into 
a saucepan and set it over the fire. Wet the tablespoon- 
ful of flour up with cold water, and when the liquor 
boils stir it in with a great spoonful of butter. Beat it 
smooth before adding the juice of a lemon. Serve in a 
gravy-dish. Take up the beef, letting all the liquor 
drain from it, and send it on a hot platter. (Save the 
pot4iquor for bean soup.) 

Roast Veal. — 57. 
The loin of veal is the best piece for roasting. The 
breast and rack are good roasted. The breast also is 
good made into a pot-pie, and the rack cut into small 
pieces and broiled. The leg is nice for frying, and when 
several slices have been cut off for cutlets, the remainder 
is nice boiled with a small piece of salt pork. Veal for 
roasting should be salted, peppered, and a little butter 
rubbed on it, and basted frequently. Put a little water 
in the dripping-pan, and unless the meat is quite fat a 
little butter should be put in. The fillet is good baked. 
The bone should be cut out, and the place filled with a 
dressing made of bread soaked soft in cold water, a 
little salt, pepper, a couple of eggs, and a tablespoonful 
of melted butter put in, then sew it up, put it in your 
bake-pan with about a pint of water, cover the top of 
the meat with some of the dressing. When baked sufifi- 
ciently, take it up, thicken the gravy with a little flour 
and water well mixed, put in a small piece of butter, and 
a little wine and catchup, if you like the gravy rich. 



— 33 — 
Rolled Loin of Mutton.— 58. 

With a sharp Knife remove all the bones from three 
pounds of the best end of a loin of mutton, cut away the 
fillet from the bones, mince it very fine, add an equal 
weight of bread crumbs, a shallot scraped and minced, a 
little fresh parsley chopped, salt and pepper, and enough 
egg to bind it. Place this on the mutton, bind it up 
lightly with tape, rub the outside with flour, pepper and 
salt, and roast slowly in the V-oven, or in any other way 
you choose. Fry the bones with onions until brown, 
and make them into a good gravy with a little stock 
and any morsels of meat you happen to have. Thicken 
the gravy and pour round the meat. Garnish with 
stewed or glazed onions. 

A Nice Way to Serve Cold Beef.— 59. 

Cut cold roast beef into slices, put gravy enough to 
cover them, and a wineglassful of catchup or wine, or a 
lemon sliced thin ; if you have not gravy, put hot water 
and a good bit of butter, with a teaspoonful or more of 
browned flour ; put it in a closely covered stewpan, and 
let it simmer gently for half an hour. If you choose, 
when the meat is done, cut a leek in thin slices, and 
chop a bunch of parsley small, and add it; serve boiled 
or mashed potatoes with it. This is equal to beef a la 
mode. Or, cold beef may be served cut in neat slices, 
garnished with sprigs of parsley and made mustard, and 
tomato catchup in the castor. Serve mashed (if not new) 
potatoes with it, and ripe fruit, or pie, or both, for des- 
sert, for a small family dinner. 



— 34— 

Fried Livej*. — 60. 

Cut the liver into thin shces. Cut the onions fine. Put 
a tablespoonful of dripping in a pan and let it get hot. Add 
the liver, and let it cook for about ten minutes. Then 
turn it out on a warm dish. Put in the onions, and fry 
them brown. Mix a teaspoonful of flour and some 
pepper and salt in half a cup of water, and stir it into 
the pan with the onions ; let it boil up for a minute, then 
pour it over the liver. 

Beefsteak and Mushrooms. — 61. 

Take one quart of fresh mushrooms, skin, and wash 
them carefully through several waters, and put them in 
a stewpan with no more water than that which adheres 
to them. Season with salt and pepper, and dredge 
through them a dessertspoonful of flour, stirring them 
lightly ; when half done add two ounces of fresh butter. 
Broil one or more steaks, which, when done, place on a 
well heated dish and season with salt and pepper, basting 
them with butter. Then pour the mushrooms over, and 
serve hot. 

Cold Meat Balls,— 62. 

One-half pound of cooked meat, one large tabiCspoonful 
of mashed potatoes, a small cooked onion, a little parsley, 
chopped, three-fourths of a teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, one-half an egg. Chop the meat, the parsley and 
the onion very fine ; add the seasoning, the potatoes and 
the egg, and mix with a fork. Roll the mi.xture up into 
balls with floured hands ; drop the balls into smoking- 
hot fat, a few at a time, and fry. Pile up within the 
potato border, and pour brown sauce over them. 



— 35 — 

Minced OoUops.— 63. 

Minced coUops form a favorite dinner and supper 
dish. Butchers now keep the minced meat at call, but 
care should be taken, for obvious reasons, to procure 
the mince at a respectable butcher's. Season the collops 
to taste with pepper and salt, and about a tablespoonful 
of catchup to a pound. Place in a stewpan and do them 
over a slow fire; keep constantly moving the collops 
with a wooden spoon to prevent them from lumping or 
burning. Some cooks put in a small teacupful of gravy 
or soup stock, others a little browned butter, so as to 
liquefy them. Many people cut up an onion very small 
to cook along with the collops ; others, if they are to be 
used at once, add a few toasted bread crumbs. The 
mince should be ready in about an hour. 

Croquettes of Gold Meat.— 64. 

One-half pound of cooked meat, one dessertspoonful 
of ilour, one-half teacupful of water, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, six potatoes boiled and mashed, one-fourth 
teaspoonful of pepper. Chop up the meat very 
fine, and mix with it the flour, pepper and salt. Put 
the water in a small saucepan and add the chopped 
meat, etc., and stir all over the fire till it boils and 
becomes quite thick. Turn it out on a plate to get 
cold. Now take one tablespoonful of the mashed 
potato and one of flour; knead them together till firm; 
roll the paste out quite thin ; cut it in round or square 
pieces ; wet the edges of them. Put some of the meat 
inside each, double them over and put them on a greased 
oven-tin in a quick oven to bake, or else put them into 
smoking-hot dripping to fry. 



-36- 

Beef Hash.— 65. 
Two parts of cold roast beef, freed from fat and 
chopped fine; one part of cold potatoes, chopped fine; 
a little pepper, salt and melted butter. Turn in a frying- 
pan, and stir until it is heated through, but not brown ; 
put into a deep dish and form into a hillock. Or, cease 
stirring for a few minutes, and let a brown crust form ; 
then serve in a round dish, with the crust upper- 
most. The hash may also be served on small squares 
of toast. Corned beef hash is made in precisely the same 
way, never allowing, however, a crust to form. Serve 
with poached eggs on top. 

Beef a la Mode.— 66. 

Take a piece of the thick part of the rump of beef, 
about four pounds, not too fat ; half a pound of fat 
bacon, and a calf's foot. Cut the bacon into pieces about 
two inches long and half an inch square ; lard the beef 
through with the bacon, place the beef in the pan, and 
also the foot, divided into two, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs, two middle-sized carrots cut into squares, 
twenty button onions, or four or six large ones, cut into 
slices, half a gill of brandy, a teaspoonful of salt, half 
a teaspoonful of pepper, one pint of water. Put the 
cover on the pan to prevent the steam escaping, and 
bake for three hours ; turn the pan so that the heat is 
equal on all sides ; when done, remove the fat from the 
top, put the beef into a dish, with half the foot on each 
side, and the carrots and onions around ; throw the 
gravy over; take away the herbs. This, you may 
perceive, is a most exquisite dish, will keep good many- 
days in winter and five or six in summer. It is good cold. 



-^37 — 

Venison Cutlets. — 67. 

Cut neat cutlets from the neck and fry them ten 
minutes in a stewpan with butter ; then add one-fourth of 
a pint of good gravy, a tablespoonful of vinegar, pepper 
and salt, two wineglassfuls of port or claret, and one 
ounce of butter rolled in flour. Stew gently for twenty 
minutes, then dish the cutlets around a heap of French 
beans, and strain the gravy around. 

Salmi of Wild Duck.— 68. 

One wild duck, one lemon, one bunch of sweet herbs, 
cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, one sherryglassful of 
port, one pint of well-seasoned gravy, eight olives. 
Roast the duck, and be careful it is not too much dried ; 
cut into neat pieces ; put the gravy with all the season- 
ing, the juice of half the lemon, and a pinch of cayenne. 
Stew for an hour ; then strain, thicken with arrowroot, 
and color brown. Pour over the pieces of duck, which 
should be laid in a clean stewpan. Stone the olives and 
warm up with duck. Place in a silver entree dish ; 
garnish with olives and crisp toast sippets. 

Rump Steak, Stuffed.— 69. 

Two pounds rump steak, two ounces suet, three 
ounces of bread crumbs, six olives, one dessertspoonful of 
chopped parsley, pepper and salt, two eggs. Peel and 
chop the olives small ; chop the suet ; put into a basin 
with the crumbs, parsley, olives, suet, pepper and salt ; 
mix well with the eggs; spread the mixture on the 
steak, roll and tie securely ; place in a greased paper and 
roast about three-quarters of an hour. 



-38- 

Tenderloin of Pork with Pried Apples.— 70. 

Cut the thin, membranous skin from the tenderloin, 
and put the latter in a marinade of claret seasoned with 
whole spice and a few slices of oranges. Let it stand in 
this four hours ; drain and dry on a cloth, and split in 
two lengthwise ; rub it with butter and broil until well 
done. Put in the center of a dish a mound of fried 
apples ; arrange the meat around it, and serve. The 
marinade may be boiled down, thickened, and served as 
a sauce, if a sauce is desired. 

Calf's Liver en Matelote.— 71. 

Cut the liver into rather thick slices and soak for a 
few moments in cold water. Drain and then dredge 
with flour and fry a nice brown in butter. In the mean- 
time mince two shallots and put into the stewpan with a 
sprig of chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and a couple 
of cloves. Pour in a glass of wine, and when boiled up 
add the fried liver and serve very hot. It will take a 
good half-hour to cook this dish, but it is worth the 
trouble. 

Baked Ham.— 72. 

One-half of a smoked or York ham, three-fourths of 
a pound of flour. Soak the ham for twelve hours, and 
scrape very clean in every part ; then make a paste with 
the flour and water — a pretty firm paste ; roll it out into 
a sheet large enough to cover all the bacon ; wrap the 
bacon up in this and wet the edges where it is joined, to 
make it adhere. See that it is covered in every part. 
Put this now in a roasting-pan, and put in the oven to 



— 39 — 

roast about two and one-half hours ; when this is done 
the paste will be very brown and hard ; crack it off and 
remove the skin. It may be covered with raspings and 
served hot, which is best, or served cold, having been 
glazed and decorated. The flavor of this is delicious. 



Mutton or Lamb Outlets with Tomato 
Sauce.— 73. 

Cut the cutlets off the loin and back ribs, and trim 
them; then dip them in the beaten yolks of eggs; have 
some parsley minced, a little nutmeg, the grating of a 
lemon, pepper and salt. Mix these together and dip the 
cutlets into it. Fry them on both sides till they become 
a nice light brown ; then put them before the fire upon 
paper to drain ; dish them in a circle around the dish ; 
pour some tomato sauce around them, and some whole 
tomatoes in the center — when whole tomato is not to be 
had, green peas or asparagus peas may be substituted, 
and also a macedoine of vegetables. 



Lamb's Pry.— 74. 

Parboil the sweetbreads. Throw them into cold 
water, and when cold trim them. Flour all the pieces 
and fry in the frying-pan in a little dripping or in the fat 
of the fried bacon, which should be served with the fry. 
When nicely browned, pour a little water into the drip- 
ping-pan and thicken it with a little flour. Throw in a 
little chopped parsley and season with pepper and salt ; 
it takes about ten minutes to fry. 



— 40 — 

Oannelon of Beef with Mushroom Sauce. — 75. 

Two pounds of lean beef cut from round, the grated rind 
of half a lemon, one tablespoohftrl of^n^lychopped pars- 
ley, one egg, one-half teaspoonful of onion juice, two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a few gratings of nutmeg, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. 
Chop meat fine and add remaining ingredients in order 
given. Shape in a roll six inches long, wrap in buttered 
paper, place on rack in dripping-pan, and bake thirty- 
minutes. Baste every five minutes with one-fourth cup- 
ful of butter melted in one cupful of boiling water. Serve 
with brown mushroom sauce. 

Pried Salt Pork.— 76. 

Cut into slices and lay them in cold water in the 
spider, boil them up two or three minutes, then pour off 
the water and set the spider again on the coals and 
brown the slices on each side. It is an improvement to 
dip the pork, after being parboiled, into Indian meal be- 
fore frying it. 

To Fry Sausages.— 77. 

These are fried in the cases in a clean, dry frying-pan 
until brown. If you have the sausage meat in bulk, 
make into small, round, flat cakes, and fry in the same man- 
ner. Some dip into egg and pounded crackers, others roll 
in flour before cooking. Their own fat will cook them. 
Send to the table dry and hot, and do not let them fry 
hard. Fifteen or twenty minutes is long enough to cook 
them.

— 41 — 

Boiled or Steamed Turkey or Fowl. — 78. 

Clean, rub well with salt, pepper and lemon juice, and 
stuff with oyster or bread stuffing. It is better without 
the stuffing, as the oysters are usually overdone, and 
the same flavor may be obtained from an oyster sauce 
served with the turkey. Truss the legs and wings close 
to the body, pin the fowl in a cloth to keep it whiter and 
preserve the shape. Put into boiling salted water. 
Allow twenty minutes to the pound. Cook slowly till 
tender, but not long enough for it to fall apart. Turkeys 
are much nicer steamed than boiled. Serve with oyster, 
celery, lemon or caper sauce. Garnish with a border of 
boiled rice or macaroni and pour part of the sauce over 
the fowl. Fowls are sometimes stuffed with boiled 
celery cut into pieces an inch long, or with macaroni 
which has been boiled and seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Partridge Pie.— 79. 

One brace of partridges, one pound of fillet of veal, 
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, three gills of 
brown stock, four ounces of butter, one dessertspoonful 
of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Pluck, draw and 
singe the partridges, after which split each in halves. 
Put into each a piece of butter, sprinkling them also 
with a little pepper and salt. Place then in the bottom 
of a deep pie-dish the fillet of veal, sprinkle over it the 
chopped parsley, and, putting the halves of partridges 
upon this, line the edge of the dish with a strip of puff 
paste ; pour over all the stock, and cover over all a 
blanket' of the paste rolled to half an inch in thickness, 
Pake the pie in a quick oven for an hour and a half 



— 42 — 

Supreme of Chicken. — 80. 
Breast and second joints of uncooked chicken weigh- 
ing four pounds, four eggs, two-thirds cupful of thick 
cream, salt and pepper. Force chicken through a meat 
chopper or chop very fine. Beat eggs separately, add one 
at a time, stirring until mixture is smooth. Add cream and 
season with salt and pepper. Turn into slightly buttered 
dariole moulds and bake as lobster timbals, allowing 
thirty minutes for baking. Serve with bechamel sauce. 

Roast Duck. — 81. 
Clean, wash and wipe the ducks very carefully. To 
the usual dressing add a little sage and a minced shallot. 
Stuff and sew up as usual, reserving the giblets for the 
gravy. If they are tender, they will not require more 
than an hour to roast. Baste well. Skim the gravy 
before putting in the giblets and thickening. The giblets 
should be stewed in a very little water, then chopped 
fine and added to the gravy in the dripping-pan with a 
chopped shallot and a spoonful of browned flour. 

Creamed Chicken. — 82. 
Creamed chicken is delicious and should be prepared 
thus : Cut a cold fowl into slices, season with salt and 
pepper and put away in a cool place overnight ; in the 
morning put a tablespoonful of butter in the frying-pan 
and when boiling stir into it a tablespoonful of flour; 
add a coffeecupful of broth, stir until smooth, and then 
add gradually a teacupful of hot milk ; let all come to a 
boil, add the chicken and let simmer for five minutes • 
slices of nicely browned toast placed on the dish are an 
improvement. 



— 43 — 

Boast Partridge. — 83. 

When ready for eating, prepare and truss the same as 
pheasant or grouse. Dredge with flour, skewer a slice 
of fat bacon over the breast, roast for twenty or thirty 
minutes. Five minutes before done, remove the bacon, 
and allow the breast to brown nicely. Baste well the 
whole time. Serve with brown gravy, bread sauce and 
fried bread crumbs. 

Blanquettes of Turkey. — 84. 

Take the remains of cold turkey and cut into neat 
slices ; break up the bones and put them on to stew in 
enough cold water to cover them, with a small piece of 
ham, a shallot and a blade of mace. Let this cook 
for half an hour, then strain it, pour it back into the 
saucepan, season with salt, pepper, a little nutmeg, half a 
teaspoonful of grated lemon rind, and one gill of cream. 
Beat in the yolk of an egg. Simmer three or four min- 
utes, stirring all the time. Put the pieces of turkey in to 
heat, and serve with fried croutons. 

PricELSseed Chicken.— 85. 

Cut up the chickens, wash them, and let them remain 
in water half an hour in order to make them white. 
Drain them and put them in a saucepan with a pint of 
fresh water. Season them with pepper and salt, place 
them on the fire and let them stew half an hour. Then 
take two tablespoonfuls of flour and two ounces of 
butter, stir them well together till quite smooth, and add 
this to the chickens with half a pint of cream. Boil till 
the chickens are tender. A little mace or onion parsley 
may be added if desired. 



— 44 — 

Wild Ducks.— 86. 

One pair of wild ducks, one-quarter of a pound of 
butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper. Carefully pluck, draw and singe the fowls, wash 
them slightly, and dry them inside and outside with a 
towel. Sprinkle inside of each the pepper and salt, spread 
the butter well over the breasts, and placing them side by 
side upon a dripping-pan, bake in a very quick hot oven 
fifteen minutes. The blood should follow the knife 
when carved, if the duck be properly cooked. Cut into 
slices some boiled hominy, fry them to a Hght brown in 
butter, and, arranging these upon a platter, serve the 
fowl upon this with an accompaniment of currant jelly. 

"Oervelles," or Brains.— 87. 

Put the brains to soak in warm water until you can 
easily remove the skin and free them from blood. Then 
put them in cold water with a little salt, and let them 
remain for an hour or two. Now simmer them very 
gently for about three-quarters of an hour in sufficient 
milk to cover them, with a carrot, turnip, onion, two 
cloves, pepper, salt and a tablespoonful of vinegar. The 
vegetables and cloves must be tied in a piece of muslin. 
The stock the brains are cooked in can be used for a 
vegetable soup. After the brains are cooked, cut them 
into pieces, egg and bread-crumb them. Fry them 
slightly on both sides in butter, then toss a little chopped 
parsley in the same butter; add a squeeze of lemon, and 
pour the butter and parsley over the brains, 



MEAT AND FISH SAUCES 

AND SALAD DRESSING. 

Plain Lobster Sauce. — 88. 

One small lobster, some spawn, one and one-half 
ounces of butter, one ounce of flour, three-fourths of a 
pint of milk, a few drops of lemon juice, pepper and salt. 
Remove the flesh from the body and claws of the lobster, 
and cut it into small pieces. Then boil the shell, broken 
small, in the milk. Rub the spawn with one-fourth of 
an ounce of butter through a hair sieve. Melt the 
remaining butter in a small stewpan. Mix in the flour 
smoothly, and then add the milk strained. Stir until it 
thickens. Put in the spawn and butter, and continue stir- 
ring until the flour is well cooked. Then add the cream — 
let it boil in the sauce — and lastly, the lemon juice, pep- 
per and salt and lobster. 

Dutch Sauce.— 89. 

Take two ounces of butter, put it into a stewpan with 
four yolks of eggs, and stand the pan in a saucepan of 
hot water over the fire, and keep stirring it well ; season 
it with salt to taste and a dust of cayenne ; stir till it 
thickens and is quite smooth, and be very careful that it 
does not boil or it will curdle. When ready to serve, 
put in one tablespoonful of French vinegar, one of 
tarragon, and half the juice of a lemon. 

45 



-46- 

Oaper Sauce. — 90. 

One ounce of butter, three-quarters of a pint of milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of capers, pepper and salt. Melt the 
butter, add the flour, then the milk ; stir well one way, 
let it boil two minutes, then add the capers. 

Cream Sauce. — 91. 

Warm one cupful of cream. Beat the yolks of two eggs, 
strain them into the warm cream, and cook over hot 
water till the eggs thicken the cream like boiled custard. 
Stir all the time, and when smooth and thickened remove 
from the fire and add salt and pepper to taste. Serve 
with boiled celery, cauliilower, chicken, oysters, fish, etc. 

Plain White Sauce.— 92 

One ounce of butter ; three-fourths of an ounce of 
flour, one-half pint of milk, a few drops of lemon juice, 
pepper and salt. Melt the butter in a small stewpan. 
Mix in the flour smoothly. Add the milk. Stir and 
cook well. Then add the lemon juice and seasoning. 
A little cream may also be added if desired. 

Parsley Sauce. — 93. 

Two ounces of butter, one and one-half ounces of 
flour, one pint of milk, a few drops of lemon juice, 
pepper and salt, two dessertspoonfuls of finely chopped 
parsley. Melt the butter in a small stewpan. Mix in 
the flour smoothly Add the milk, stir and cook well. 
Then add the lemon juice, seasoning and chopped 
parsley. 



— 47 — 

Mayonnaise Sauce.— 94. 

Take a round-bottomed basin ; put therein three yolks 
of eggs, and with a wooden spoon work it by stirring 
quickly until the yolks become light ; add about half a 
pint of salad oil and half a gill of tarragon vinegar ; 
these must be incorporated by degrees ; and in order to 
produce the sauce in perfection, it must present the 
appearance of a firm, creamy substance. This cold sauce 
is especially adapted for chicken and lobster salads. 
When made, pepper and salt must be added, also two 
tablespoonfuls of thick cream. 

Shrimp Sauce.— 96. 

Pound your shrimp, shells and all, in a mortar, and 
then boil the lot for about twelve minutes in half a pint 
of water, strain the liquor obtained into a stewpan, and 
add a piece of butter of the size of a small egg, mixed 
up in a teaspoonful of flour. Stir till the sauce is upon 
the point of boiling, season with a little cayenne and a 
taste of anchovy sauce. 

Bechamel Sauce. — 96. 

One and one-half cupfuls of white stock, one slice of 
onion, one slice of carrot, bit of bay leaf, sprig of pars- 
ley, six pepper-corns, one-fourth cupful of butter, one- 
fourth cupful of flour, one cupful of scalded milk, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper. 
Cook stock twenty minutes with onion, carrot, bay leaf, 
parsley and pepper-corn, then strain. There should be 
one cupful. Melt the butter, add the flour, and gradually 
the hot stock and milk. Season with salt and pepper. 



-48- 

Onion Sauce. — 97. 

Four or five fair-sized onions, one-half pint of plain 
white sauce or melted butter. First, blanch the onions 
by putting them in cold water and bringing it to a boil. 
Throw the water away. Put the onions in fresh water 
and boil for an hour or an hour and a half, until tender. 
Chop them finely and add them to the sauce or melted 
butter. 

Plain Salad Dressing. — 98. 

Plain salad dressing is admissible with nearly all 
salads. It is composed of oil, vinegar, pepper and salt, 
and nothing else. Many who do not care particularly 
for oil, use equal quantities of oil and vinegar, others 
one-third vinegar to two-thirds oil. These proportions 
satisfy a large class, but four parts of oil to one of vine- 
gar are about the right proportions, provided the vinegar 
is of the best. The plain dressing is made in two ways, 
either mixed in a bowl and the salad added to it, or as 
follows: Take a tablespoon and put in it (holding it 
over the salad) one saltspoonful of salt, one-fourth this 
quantity of freshly ground pepper, and a tablespoonful of 
oil ; mix and add to the salad. Add three more table- 
spoonfuls of oil ; toss the salad lightly for a few seconds. 
Lastly, add a tablespoonful of sharp vinegar ; toss the 
salad again and serve. 



VEGETABLES. 

Tomatoes.— 99. 

These are better baked tjian boiled ; boiling destroys 
their flavor. Put them on a baking-tin, greased with 
butter or dripping. Sprinkle over them a little pepper 
and salt, and cover them with a greased paper. Put 
them in a moderate oven for about ten minutes or a 
quarter of an hour. 

Boston Baked Pork and Beans.— 100. 

Soak one quart of pea beans in cold water overnight. 
In the morning put them into fresh, cold water and 
simmer till soft enough to pierce with a pin, being care- 
ful not to let them boil enough to break. If you like, 
boil one onion with them. When soft, turn them into a 
colander and pour cold water through them. Place 
them with the onion in a bean-pot. Pour boiling water 
over one-quarter of a pound of salt pork, part fat and 
part lean; scrape the rind till white. Cut the rind in 
half-inch strips ; bury the pork in the beans, leaving only 
the rind exposed. Mix one teaspoonful of salt — more, 
if the pork is not very salt — and one teaspoonful of 
mustard with one-quarter of a cup of molasses. Fill 
the cup with hot water, and when well mixed pour it 
over the beans ; add enough more water to cover them. 
Keep them covered with water until the last hour ; then 



— 50 — 

lift the pork to the surface and let it crisp. Bake eight 
hours in a moderate oven. Use more salt and one-third 
of a cup of butter if you dislike pork, or use half a 
pound of fat and lean corned beef The mustard gives 
the beans a delicious flavor and also renders them more 
wholesome. Many add a teaspoonful of soda to the 
water in which the beans are boiled, to destroy the acid 
in the skin of the beans. Yellow-eyed beans and Lima 
beans are also good when baked. Much of the excel- 
lence of baked beans depends upon the bean-pot. It 
should be earthen, with a narrow mouth and bulging 
sides. This shape is seldom found outside of New 
England, and is said to have been modeled after the 
Assyrian pots. In spite of the slurs against " Boston 
baked beans," it is often remarked that strangers enjoy 
them as much as natives ; and many a New England 
bean-pot has been carried to the extreme South and 
West, that people there might have "baked beans" in 
perfection. They afford a nutritious and cheap food for 
people who labor in the open air. 

Asparagus.— 101 . 
Wash it, trim off the white ends and tie it up in 
bunches with a twine or a strip of old cotton. Throw 
them into boiling water with salt in it. Boil twenty 
minutes or half an hour. Have ready two or three 
slices of toasted bread, dip them into the water and lay 
them in the dish. Spread them with butter and lay the 
bunches of asparagus upon the toast. Cut the strings 
with scissors and draw them out without breaking the 
stalks ; lay thin shavings of butter over the asparagus 
and send it to the table. 



— 51 — 

Boiled Cauliflower.- 102. 

Soak it in salt and water to draw out any insects, and 
trim off the outside leaves. Put it, with the flower 
downwards, into a saucepan of boiling water with salt in 
it, and cook from twenty to thirty minutes, according to 
its age. Drain it on a sieve or colander. If liked, it 
may be served with white or French sauce poured 
over it. 

French Baked Potatoes.— 103. 

Six large potatoes ; bake them in the oven ; cut them 
neatly in halves. Scoop out all the potato carefully and 
work it through a sieve; melt half an ounce of butter in 
a saucepan ; add two tablespoonfuls of milk, one tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, pepper and salt to taste; 
work this up into a paste over the fire. Now fill each 
half potato quite full ; rub the top over with the white of 
an egg or a few drops of melted butter ; brown the top 
either with a salamander or a hot "iron," or, failing 
these articles, put the potato halves into the oven for a 
few minutes. Serve alone or with cold meats. If you 
have cream, use it instead of milk. 

Boiled Beets.— 104. 

Wash the roots ; do not brush or scrape them. Put 
them in a saucepan and cover them with boiling water ; 
boil very gently for one or two hours, according to size. 
Strain off the water, pare and trim the roots and serve 
cut in thick slices with melted butter poured over. If to 
be eaten cold, pour vinegar and a very little good salad 
oil over the slices. 



— 52 — 

stewed Parsnips.— 105. 

Two parsnips, one-half ounce of butter, one large tea- 
cupful of milk, pepper and salt, one-half ounce of flour. 
Wash the parsnips very clean ; if necessary, brush them. 
Have plenty of boiling water and a little salt. Put the 
parsnips in, and boil till tender for about three-quarters 
of an hour, but that depends on their size. Take them 
out of the pan and scrape all the skin off quite clean, 
then cut them into slices. Put the butter, flour and milk 
into a small saucepan and mix smoothly. Stir till it 
boils ; season a little. Put the parsnips in among the 
sauce to heat; let them be well covered with it and 
serve hot. 

To Fry Egg-plant.— 106. 

Cut them in slices half an inch thick, sprinkle them 
with salt, and let them stand a few minutes to extract 
the bitter taste ; wash them in cold water, and wipe 
them dry ; season them with salt and pepper ; dip them 
in flour, and fry them in butter. Another way of cook- 
ing them is to cut them in thin slices, and bake them on 
a bake-iron that is hot enough to bake cakes. 

Stewed Mushrooms. — 107. 

Peel and rinse the mushrooms, and cut off the ends 
of the stalks. Stew them gently in water, stock or 
milk until quite tender, adding pepper and salt to taste. 
Then thicken the gravy with a little flour, and let it cook 
well, stirring carefully. Before serving, stir in a little 
cream or butter. 



— S3 — 

Succotash.— 108. 

One pint of green corn cut from the cob, and two- 
thirds of a pint of Lima beans; let them stew in just 
enough water to cover them, until tender, then season 
with butter, pepper and salt and a little milk ; simmer 
together a few moments and serve. 

Celery a la Creme.— 109. 

Time to boil the celery, three-quarters of an hour. 
Six heads of celery, half a pint of cream or milk, a piece 
of butter rolled in flour, nutmeg and salt. Cut the 
celery three or four inches long, wash very clean 
and boil in water until tender. Boil up the cream, 
butter and flour till it is thick and smooth, pour over 
the celery and serve hot. 

Summer Squash. — 110. 

If the rind is tender, boil it whole in a little bag kept 
for the purpose. Put it in boiling water, and cook three- 
quarters of an hour. Take the bag into a pan and press 
it with the edge of the plate or with a ladle until the 
water is out ; then turn the squash out into a dish, add 
salt and butter, and smooth over the top. 

Fried Cucumbers. — 111. 

Slice the cucumbers when the seeds are full grown, 
and before they turn yellow or ripen ; sprinkle salt on 
the slices, let them stand for an hour, and fry th^m ?is 
fish, with hot Urd or butter, 



— 54 — 

Tomatoes on Toast. — 112. 
Take six or eight ripe tomatoes, cut off the stalks and 
any green part there may be, take out the seeds and cut 
the tomatoes into thick slices ; arrange these in a single 
layer on a greased baking-tin, sprinkle over them some 
finely sifted bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper, 
put a little piece of butter on each slice and bake in a 
brisk oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. Serve on 
neatly cut pieces of hot buttered toast, with the gravy 
that is in the dish with them poured over. A few drops 
of lemon juice is an improvement. 

Corn Croquettes. — 113. 

To two cupfuls of green corn, chopped, add one well- 
beaten egg, a teaspoonful of butter, one of sugar, salt to 
taste, and just enough flour to hold the ingredients 
together. Form into croquettes with floured hands, and 
fry in deep fat. 

Water-cress. — 114. 

Wash, trim and pick the cress, drain it in a colander, 
put it into a dry, clean cloth and gently shake it about 
until all moisture is absorbed. Arrange the cress in 
circles on a fat dish, and serve within an hour of prepar- 
ing it, as it will lose its crispness if left standing too 
long. 

Parsnip Fritters. — 115. 

Boil parsnips till tender, cool, and remove pith and 
skin ; mash fine. To every teacupful add a beaten egg ; 
add flour to thicken and salt to taste. Drop into boiling 
lard and brown. 



SALADS. 

Breakfast Salad.— 116. 

Scald two ripe tomatoes, peel off the skin, and place 
them in ice-water; when very cold slice them. Peel and 
slice very thin one small cucumber. Put four leaves of 
lettuce, the tomatoes and cucumber into a salad-bowl. 
Cut up one spring onion, add it, and, if possible, add four or 
five tarragon leaves. Now add a plain dressing and serve. 

Sardine Salad.— 117. 

Arrange one quart of any kind of cooked fish on a bed 
of crisp lettuce. Split six sardines, and if there are any 
bones, remove them. Cover the fish with the sardine 
dressing. Over this put the sardines, having the ends 
meet in the center of the dish. At the base of the dish 
make a wreath of thin slices of lemon. Garnish with 
parsley or lettuce and serve immediately. 

Gold Slaw.— 118. 

One cup of vinegar, a piece of butter the size of a 
walnut, one egg, one teaspoonful of mustard, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoon- 
ful of flour, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Boil the 
vinegar and melt the butter in it and pour over the 
above mixture ; stir it well, then put it back on the stove 
to boil again about a minute ; then pour the whole upon 
the chopped cabbage. 



-56- 

Lettuce Salad. — 119. 

Get that in which the head is hard and compact. Lay 
it in ice-water until nearly time to serve. Then break off 
the imperfect leaves and throw them aside. Cut off the 
remainder of the leaves from the root and look them 
over carefully. Wash in two or three waters and 
arrange the leaves in the bottom of a salad dish. Allow 
two hard boiled eggs for each head of lettuce. Put bits 
of ice in here and there, after you have sliced in the hard 
boiled eggs. Send at once to the table and serve with 
sugar, vinegar, mustard and the best salad oil. 

Cucumber Salad.— 120. 

If properly prepared, cucumbers are not apt to inter- 
fere with digestion. They should be gathered early in 
the morning and kept in a cool place until wanted. 
After peeling, slice them very thin, sprinkle a little salt 
over them, let stand ten minutes and add cayenne and 
equal parts of oil and vinegar. If allowed to remain in 
salt water any length of time, if oil is omitted, or if their

powdered coral. 

Chicken Salad.— 123. 

The white meat of cold boiled chicken or turkey, 
three-quarters of the same bulk of chopped celery, a rich 
mayonnaise. Chop the meat fine, removing every scrap 
of fat, gristle and skin ; mix carefully with the celery, 
and set in a cold place while you mix the mayonnaise. 
Be sure to make enough mayonnaise, not only to mix 
thoroughly with the chicken, but to lie on the top. 
Garnish with a wreath of lettuce hearts, hard boiled 
eggs, pickled cucumbers and beets cut into shapes. 

Shrimp Salad.— 124. 

Boil a quart of fresh shrimps for twenty minutes. 
Open and throw away the shells. Take the crisp leaves 
of a head of lettuce, and place in a salad-bowl with two 
fresh tomatoes peeled and sliced. Add the shrimps and 
pour over all a mayonnaise — red, if convenient — and 
serve. 

Tomato Salad.— 125. 

Twelve tomatoes peeled and sliced, four eggs boiled 
hard, one egg (raw) well beaten, one teaspoonful of 
salt, one-half of a teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, one 
teaspoonful of sugar, one teacupful of vinegar ; set on 
ice to become perfectly cold. 



-58- 

Lobster Salad.— 126. 

One fine lobster, one lettuce, one endive, three or four 
hard boiled eggs, some mayonnaise dressing ; if possible, 
some aspic jelly. Remove the flesh from the body and 
claws of the lobster, and cut into pieces. Let the lettuce 
be well washed and dried, cut it up, and mix it with the 
lobster and some mayonnaise sauce. Put a border of 
chopped aspic on a dish. Heap the salad in the middle. 
Decorate the salad with pieces of endive and hard boiled 
eggs cut in quarters. 

Orange Salad.— 127. 

Two oranges, one-fourth of a pint of oil, one teaspoon- 
ful of vinegar, one saltspoonful of pepper, one-half of a 
saltspoonful of salt. Cut the oranges into thin slices. 
Mix the vinegar, pepper, salt and oil^ and pour over- the 
orange. 

Oyster Salad.— 128. 

Directions for dressing one gallon of oysters : Heat 
the oysters until they curd or plump ; mix together the 
well-beaten yolks of twelve raw eggs, half a cupful of 
made mustard, one teacupful of white sugar, one teacup- 
ful of butter. These ingredients must be made hot, and 
be ready to pour over the oysters as soon as these are 
ladled out of the kettle. As shortly before the time of 
serving supper as is practicable, chop up as much 
bleached celery as will fill a quart measure ; add it to the 
dressed oysters, mixing lightly with a wooden fork and 
spoon, and placing it in a salad bowl, ready for serving. 



— 59 — 

Egg Salad,— 129. 

Slice hard boiled eggs, arrange them upon crisp let- 
tuce leaves, and pour over them all a mayonnaise 
dressing. 

Potato Salad.— 130. 

Potato salad is composed of boiled potatoes, peeled 
and sliced ; one onion, peeled and sliced very thin, to six 
potatoes ; and plenty of plain salad dressing. Sometimes 
a little chopped parsley is added. Variations of potato 
salad are made by the addition of green onions chopped 
fine, lettuce, or small dice of fried salt pork. 

Spring Salad.— 131. 

In a salad-bowl put first a layer of fresh, crisp water- 
cress, then a layer of thinly sliced cucumbers which have 
been soaked in cold water fifteen minutes, then a tea- 
spoonful of minced chives, then another layer of cucum- 
bers, and around the edge a light border of the cresses. 
When ready to serve, pour a French dressing over it 
and toss it over until well mingled. This is appropriate 
to serve with a course of broiled fish. 

Potato Salad.— 132. 

Boil and peel potatoes ; let them get perfectly cold, 
and cut into dice shape. Seven large potatoes, one 
goblet of rich cream, one-half of a teacupful of vinegar, 
one teaspoonful of black pepper, one tablespoonful of 
olive oil (more if you hke), three onions sliced thin; 
salt and pepper to taste, and garnish the dish with 
radishes and lettuce leaves. 



— 6o — 

Scallop Salad.— 133. 

Rinse one pint of scallops in cold water, then cook in 
boiling water with one teaspoonful of salt, and one table- 
spoonful of lemon juice half an hour. Drain, plunge 
into cold water, and when chilled and firm dry them in a 
napkin. Cut them in very thin slices across the grain, 
and mix them with an equal quantity of thinly sliced 
cucumbers, add a sprinkling of thinly sliced onion or 
chives and dress them with salt, cayenne, oil and vinegar, 
and serve on a bed of shredded lettuce. 

Veal Salad.— 134. 

Chop the veal fine and allow one cup of celery to one 
cup of meat. Mix well. For the dressing, put one cup 
of milk on to heat, add one egg and butter the size of an

one-half teaspoonful of mustard and the same of salt and 
sugar. 

Russian Salad. — 135.

naise, half a pint of aspic jelly, six gherkins. Boil the

Arrange the salad in layers, paying attention to the 
effect of color, each layer getting smaller till the top 
comes to a point. 



PASTRY. 

A Light Paste.— 136. 

Three-fourths of a pound of flour, one-half of a pound 
of butter, the whole of an egg. Beat the white of egg 
to a strong froth. Then mix it with a little water, suffi- 
cient to mix the flour to a paste. Handle it very lightly. 
Roll it out thin and lay the third part of the butter 
about it in little pieces. Dredge it with flour and roll it 
up. Roll out again, and put in the same proportion of 
butter. Do this once more and the paste is ready. 

PuflF Paste.— 137. 

Dry and sift a pound of flour and put it on a marble 
slab (if there is one); make a hole in the center, and put 
into it half a teaspoonful of salt and not quite half a pint 
of water; mix this in with a knife till it is a clear, smooth 
paste; work it lightly with the hands till it ceases to 
adhere to the board ; let it remain to cool for two min- 
utes, then flatten the paste till it is an inch thick ; have 
ready three-quarters of a pound of butter free from salt 
and moisture, and lay the butter on in the center, and 
fold over the four sides of the paste so as to form a 
square and completely hide the butter ; let this cool for 
a few minutes, then dredge the slab or board and the 
paste with flour, and roll the paste out till it is three 
feet in length; take care the butter does not break 
through the flour; fold over a third upon it; let the 

6j 



— 62 — 

paste rest for ten minutes, then give it two more turns ; 
then let it rest and give it two more turns, making in all 
five turns. The paste should be baked as soon as 
possible. For patties and vol-au-vent, six or seven turns 
will be required. 

Orange Pie.— 138. 

One pound of sugar, half a pound of butter, the grated 
rind and juice of four oranges, the yolks of four eggs 
beaten light ; add to the butter and sugar and beat hard, 
and then add the orange ; beat the whites very light and 
mix in last. Bake in paste in tin pie-plates. 

Berry Pie.— 139. 

Pick over the berries and sprinkle slightly with flour ; 
add sugar to taste — about one cupful for a quart of fruit. 
Do not spoil the fruit flavor by using spices. Bake in a 
deep plate, with two crusts. 

Oocoanut Pie.— 140. 

One quart of new milk, three eggs, one tablespoonful 
of butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one pint of grated 
oocoanut, which should be fresh. Bake like custard pie. 

Mince Pie. — 141. 

Take as many beef tongues as you wish; salt and rub 
sweet spices into them, and let them boil for twenty-four 
hours. When tender, remove the skins while hot. 
When cold, add to each tongue three pounds of beef 
suet, two pounds of currants, two pounds of raisins, one 
pound of citron, and one of sugar, one pint of sherry and 
one of brandy ; spice to taste ; moisten with cider. 



-63- 

Mince Pie. — 142. 

Boil and chop three pounds of lean beef, two pounds 
of suet, four pounds of good raisins, four pounds of cur- 
rants, one pound of citron, four pounds of sugar, grated 
rind and juice of three lemons and two sweet oranges, 
three grated nutmegs, two large tablespoonfuls of cloves, 
two of mace, one quart of cooking brandy, three large 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, some wine, four tablespoon- 
fuls of salt; pack it down tightly in a jar, and stir well 
before using. In making a pie, take nearly two-thirds 
of apples and more than one-third of meat ; add enough 
cider to make very juicy, and enough sugar to make 
very sweet. 

Prune Pie.— 143. 

Prunes that are too dry to eat without stewing can be 
made into good pies. Turn enough boiling water on the 
prunes to cover them, set them on a few coals, and let 
them remain till swelled out plump. If there is not 
water sufficient to make a nice syrup for the pies, add 
more, and season them with cinnamon or cloves. The 
juice and grated peel of a lemon gives them a fine flavor. 
Add sugar to the taste and bake them in deep pie-plates. 



Rice Pie.— 144. 

One quart of boiled milk, one small teacupful of rice 
flour mixed in a little cold milk ; add to the boiling milk 
two teaspoonfuls of butter ; when cold, add five eggs well 
beaten, sweeten to taste, flavor with vanilla, and bake. 



-64- 

Marlborough Pie.— 145. 

Procure sweet, mellow apples, pare and grate them. 
To a pint of the grated pulp put a pint of milk, a couple 
of eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, the grated 
peel of a lemon, and half a wineglassful of brandy. 
Sweeten it to the taste with nice brown sugar. The 
eggs should be beaten to a froth, then the sugar stirred 
into them and mixed with the rest of the ingredients. 
A little stewed pumpkin, mixed with the apples, im- 
proves the pie. Bake the pie in deep plates, without an 
upper crust. 

Apple Pie.— 146. 

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and 
cored them. Mash to a smooth compote, sweeten to 
taste, and, while hot, stir in a teaspoonful of butter for 
each pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your 
crust, and either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, 
or bake without cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar 
strewed over it. 

Custard Pie.— 147. 

Make a custard of the yolks of three eggs, with milk; 
season to taste; bake it in ordinary crust ; put it in a 
brick oven, that the crust may not be heavy ; and as soon 
as that is heated remove it to a place in the oven of a 
moderate heat, that the custard may bake slowly and not 
curdle ; when 'done, beat the whites to a froth, add the 
sugar, and spread over the top, and return to the oven to 
brown slightly. A small pinch of salt added to a custard 
heightens the flavor; a little soda in the crust prevents it 
from being heavy. Very nice. 



-6s- 

Ohocolate Pie.— 148. 
One cupful of water and two tablespoonfuls of flour 
cooked together. Into this put the following ingredients, 
after mixing: one cupful of sugar, one-fourth cupful

grated chocolate. Cook until it thickens. Put into baked 
crust, and frost with meringue made of the whites of the 
eggs and a little sugar. 

Currant Pie.— 149. 

One teacupful of red currants, one cupful of sugar, 
yolks of two eggs, one tablespoonful of flour, one-half 
tablespoonful of water. Mix and bake in lower pie crust.

pulverized sugar; spread over top and brown slightly. 

Pineapple Pie.— 150. 

One large pineapple pared and grated, half a pound 
of fresh butter, half a pound of sugar, one wineglassful 
of brandy, one tablespoonful of rose-water, a little grated 
nutmeg. Mix all together with the juice and pulp 
of the pineapple, adding a little grated bread ; bake ten 
minutes in a crust. 

Peach Pie.— 151. 

Take mellow clingstone peaches, pare bjut do not cut 
them, put them into a deep pie-plate lined with crust, 
sugar them well, put in a tablespoonful of water, and 
sprinkle a little flour over the peaches; cover with a 
thick crust, in which make a cut in the center, and bake 
for from three-quarters to one hour. 



— 66 — 

Lemon Pie. — 152. 
One tablespoonful of corn-starch, one cupful of sugar, 
one cupful of cold water, three eggs, the juice and pulp 
of one lemon, a little salt. Cook the corn-starch in the 
water ; when cold, add the yolks of the eggs, sugar, 
lemon and salt. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, 
and stir them in carefully just before putting in the oven. 

Oream Pie. — 153. 
One cupful of powdered sugar, one cupful of flour, 
one teaspoonful of cream of tartar and one-half of a tea- 
spoonful of soda, five eggs beaten separately, the grated 
rind of a lemon. Cream : Set in hot water one-half of 
a pint of milk ; when scalding hot add one-half cupful of 
sugar, a little salt and one egg beaten together ; stir

vanilla. Put between crusts. 

Cheese Straws.— 154. 
Two ounces of flour, two ounces of butter, two ounces 
of grated Parmesan cheese, the yolk of an egg, a little 
cayenne, pepper and salt. Rub the butter lightly into 
the flour. Add the grated cheese and seasoning, and 
mix with the yolk of egg. If necessary, add another 
yolk, but no water. Roll out and cut into fingers about 
a quarter of an inch wide and two inches long. Lay 
them on a greased baking-sheet. Stamp out, with a 
cutter the size of an egg-cup, some rounds, and make 
them into rings by stamping out the middle with a 
smaller cutter. Bake the rings and straws a pale brown 
color, and serve them with a bundle of straws placed in 
each ring. 



-67- 

Squash Pie. — 155. 

Peel a Hubbard squash, cut it into pieces about two 
inches square, remove the seeds without taking away 
any of the substance of the squash, and put it to steam 
in a colander closely covered %nd set over a pot of boil- 
ing water, gr place it in a porcelain-lined saucepan with- 
out water, and set it over a gentle fire where it will 
soften slowly without burning, stirring it occasionally to 
prevent burning ; or boil it until tender, in sufficient 
water to cover it. When the squash is tender, drain it 
until it is quite free from water, and rub it through a 
sieve or a fine colander with a wooden spoon or potato- 
masher. Mix one quart of the squash so prepared with 
one quart of milk, four eggs well beaten, one tablespoon- 
ful of mixed -ground cinnamon, mace and ginger, one 
teaspoonful of salt and one cupful of sugar; and use it to 
fill two large pie-plates lined with a good, plain pastry. 
Do not cover the pies with pastry, but grate a little nut- 
meg over the top, or sprinkle over them the grated rind 
of a lemon.

of sugar, four apples, one-half pound of prunes.

the mixture into the pie-dish and allow it to cool. 
Cover with short crust, and bake for about half an hour. 



— 68 — 

Red Currant and Raspberry Tart. — 157. 

Time to bake, three-quarters of an hour. A pint and 
a half of picked red currants, three-fourths of a pint of 
raspberries, one-fourth of a pound of puff paste. Pick 
the currants and raspberries from their stalks, mix them 
together in a pie-dish with the moist sugar. Wet the 
edge of the dish, place a band of puff paste around it, 
wet that also. Cover the top with puff paste, pressing 
it around the edge with your thumbs. Cut the over- 
hanging edge off evenly. Then scallop the edge by first 
chopping it in lines all around and then giving them a 
little twist at regular intervals with the knife. Take the 
edges you have cut off, flour them, roll them out, and 
cut them into leaves to ornament the top. Egg it over 
and bake it. When done, dredge it with white sugar, 
and salamander it. 

Baked Apple Dumpling.— 158.

given ; cut it into squares large enough to fold over the 
apples ; peel and core sound apples of medium size and 
tart flavor, put one in the center of each piece of pastry, 
fill the apples with sugar and half a saltspoonful of 
powdered cinnamon, and fold the pastry up over each 
apple lightly, wetting the tips of the corners and pressing 
them lightly together; arrange the dumplings in a bak- 
ing-pan, brush them with beaten egg, and bake them 
for about half an hour, or until they are done, in a mod- 
erate oven. Serve them hot or cold with powdered 
sugar and cream, or with either of the sauces for which 
recipes are given elsewhere.

rocky shape, the whites of two or three eggs beaten to 
a froth, with a large teaspoonful of powdered sugar to 
each egg, and a few drops of extract of vanilla. Put 
the pudding into a brisk but not too hot oven, and

put a wire sieve and rub through with the hands the 
necessary quantity of bread crumbs. Add these crumbs 
to the ingredients in the bowl. Whip the eggs now

One pint of fine bread crumbs, one quart of fresh, 
rich milk (hot), yolks of four eggs, one and one-half 
cupfuls of white sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one- 
half cupful of jelly or jam. Soak the crumbs in the hot 
milk, rub the butter and sugar together, and stir in the 
yolks well beaten. Mix all together with such flavoring 
as you like, and bake in a deep pudding-dish. When 
done, make the meringue of the whipped whites and 
one-half cupful of sugar; cover the pudding with the 
jelly, and over that place the meringue and brown in the 
oven. Eat cold with cream. Fresh fruit is very nice 
instead of the jelly. 

Graham Pudding.— 171. 
One and one-half cupfuls of graham flour, one cupful 
of sweet milk, one-half cupful of molasses, one cupful of 
chopped raisins, four figs chopped fine, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one teaspoonful of soda. Steam four hours in 
a two-quart pan and serve with golden sauce. 

Orange Custard Pudding. — 172. 

Boil a pint of new milk, pour it on to three eggs 
lightly beaten, mix in the grated peel of an orange and 
two ounces of loaf sugar. Beat all together for ten 
minutes, then pour the custard into a pie-dish, set it in 
another containing a little water and put it in a moderate 
oven. When the custard is set (it generally takes about 
half an hour), take it out and let it get cold. Then 
sprinkle over rather thickly some very finely sifted 
sugar and brown it with the salamander. To be eaten 
cold,

Crystal Palace Pudding.— 173. 
One ounce of gelatine, one and one-half pints of milk, 
one-fourth pound of sugar, three yolks of eggs, two 
ounces of sponge cake ; one ounce of ratifias, two bay 
leaves, three-fourths teaspoonful vanilla, two ounces of 
candied fruit or sultana raisins, a few drops of cochineal 
or carmine. Soak the gelatine in a quarter pint of 
milk; put the yolks, sugar and vanilla in a basin, 
and beat all well with a wooden spoon. Put the pint of 
milk on to boil with the bay leaves in it (it is better to 
be rather slow in coming to the boil). When boiling, 
pick out the leaves and stir in gradually among the eggs 
and sugar; return it to the saucepan with the soaked 
gelatine, and stir over the fire till the custard thickens — 
it must not boil. Pour it all out into two basins to 
get cold. Color half of it pink with the carmine. 
Now take a cream mould; put a few cherries or any 
other fruit in the bottom, add a few thin slices of the 
sponge cake and a few ratifias, and pour in some custard 
and let it get firm; then a little more cake and fruit 
and some pink custard, and repeat once more. Let it 
get quite firm and cold ; turn it out like a shape of cream. 

Peach Pudding.— 174. 

Fill a baking-dish about three-fourths full of ripe, 
juicy peaches, pared, stoned and cut into medium-sized 
pieces. Beat light the yolks of three eggs. Add four 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar, three of milk or cream 
and three of sifted flour. Add the beaten whites, and 
after sifting three tablespoonfuls of sugar over the fruit 
pour on the batter. Mix all well together and bake 
three-fourths of an hour. Eat hot with sauce. 



— 75 — 

Coffee Cream. — 175. 

Put about a breakfastcupful of strong coffee into a pan 
with half a pint of boiled cream and half a pound of sugar. 
Beat up the yolks of six eggs ; to these add a pinch of 
salt; whisk the whole well together. Place the pan 
on the stove over a slow fire, keep stirring till it 
thickens and is nearly boiling, pass it through a hair 
sieve into a basin, then add one-half ounce of dissolved 
gelatine, and stir until it is nearly cold. Pour it into a 
mould, and when set firm turn it out. 

Tapioca Cream. — 176. 

Some tapioca boiled to a jelly, some apricot jam. Put 
a layer of each alternately in a glass dish till full, then 
cover with whipped cream and decorate with crystallized 
cherries. 

Stewed Prunes.— 177. 

Put about a pound and a quarter of prunes into a pan 
with about a quarter of a pound of lump sugar. Add 
as much cold water as will nearly cover them. Put the 
pan on a slow fire or stove and stew the prunes slowly 
until tender ; then remove the stones without breaking 
the fruit much. Place the prunes in a circle round the 
dish, the same as with cutlets. Break the stones and 
pick out the kernels ; dip them in boiling water and skin 
them. Place the kernel upon each prune. The juice of 
the fruit must be boiled down to a syrup. Strain 
through muslin, color slightly with cochineal and pour 
it round the base. Whip up about half a pint of thick 
cream, heap it u n spoonfuls in the center of the dish. 
Sprinkle a little pink sugar over it and serve. 



-76- 

Snow Pyramids. — 178. 

Beat to a stiff foam the whites of half a dozen eggs, 
add a small teacupful of currant jelly and whip all 
together again. Fill as many saucers half full of cream 
as you have guests, dropping in the center of each 
saucer a tablespoonful of the beaten eggs and jelly in 
the shape of a pyramid. 

Blancmange. — 179. 

An ounce packet of gelatine, one pint of milk, one 
pint of cream, three or four ounces of castor sugar, flavor- 
ing essence. Soak the gelatine in the milk ; add the sugar 
and stir over the fire until both are dissolved. Then 
pour in the cream ; stir occasionally until cold. Add 
the flavoring essence and pour all into a wetted mould. 

Compote of Rice. — 180. 

One-fourth pound of rice, one-fourth pound of 
sugar, one pint or more of milk, vanilla or other 
flavoring. Boil the rice in the milk with the sugar for 
twenty minutes; if very stiff add a little more milk or 
cream. Flavor with vanilla and put into a buttered 
mould with a well in the center. Any fruit may be put 
in the middle when it is served. If oranges are used, 
boil a gill and a half of water with one-fourth 
pound of lump sugar until it sticks to a knife like an 
icicle. Peel the oranges and roll them in it. If apples 
are used, boil them gently in one pint of water with one- 
fourth pound of sugar. When tender, add a little 
cochineal. Take the apples out and reduce the syrup to 
less than a quarter of a pint. Roll the apples in it. 



— 77 — 

Fairy Butter.— 181. 

Two ounces of butter, the rind of one lemon, one- 
half teaspoonful of lemon juice, ten macaroons, three 
ounces of ratifia biscuit, one wineglassful of sherry, 
two ounces of sugar. Place the macaroons and ratifias 
in a crystal dish. Pour over them in spoonfuls the 
sherry, and allow them to soak for an hour; then 
sprinkle the sugar over them. Then place the butter in 
a basin, grate over it the lemon rind, add the juice, and 
with the back of a spoon beat all together till very 
smooth. Place a wire sieve over the crystal dish and 
rub the butter through with the spoon, allowing it to 
fall over the macaroons. 

Lemon Sponge.— 182. 

Put into a saucepan one-half ounce of gelatine, two 
ounces of loaf sugar, the rind of one lemon, and one- 
half pint of cold water. Melt these carefully at the side 
of the fire, then strain it into a basin to cool for five or 
ten minutes, then add to it the juice of a lemon, and the 
white of an egg. Whisk till firm. Pour it into a wetted 
mould, or serve rocky on a crystal dish. 

Red Robin.— 183. 

Take a pound of lump sugar and put it into a stewpan 
with one-half pint of water, and boil till it becomes very 
thick ; then add about two pounds of apples, peeled and 
cored, and the grated rind of a lemon ; boil all together 
till it is quite stiff; keep stirring all the time. Pour it 
into a buttered mould, and when cold turn out and serve 
with custard around. 



-78- 

Oompote of Oranges and Oocoanut. — 184. 

Six sweet oranges, grated cocoanut, one lemon, one-half 
pound of sugar, one pint of common cream, one-half pint 
of water. Peel the oranges, grating the yellow part of the 
rind of one and of the lemon. Remove all the white part 
of the rind very carefully without breaking the oranges in 
the least; divide them into liths very carefully. Put 
water, sugar, juice and grate of lemon, and the grate of 
the orange into a bright saucepan, and allow it to boil for 
five minutes, then add the oranges, and after it boils 
again, allow them to boil for five minutes. Remove the 
oranges from the pan, and boil the syrup till it becomes 
quite thick. Allow all to get quite cold. Arrange some 
of the orange liths neatly on a glass dish, add a good 
sprinkling of cocoanut, then a little syrup, then the 
remainder of the oranges, some more cocoanut and the 
remainder of the syrup. Whip up the cream to froth, 
and pile it on the top, sprinkling over some chopped 
pistachio-nuts. 

Apple Turnovers. — 185. 

Make the paste of lard or dripping in the same manner 
as puff paste, using four ounces of the fat to eight of 
flour and a gill of water. Roll the paste out one-fourth 
inch thick, and cut into squares of about four inches. 
In the center of each square pile up baking apples cut 
small, but not in slices, mixed with half their weight 
of moist sugar. Gather the edges of the paste together, 
press them and mark with a pastry-wheel, place on a 
floured baking-sheet and bake in a moderate oven for 
half an hour. 



— 79 — 

Banana Oanteloupe. — 186. 

One-half box of gelatine or two and one-half tablespoon- 
fuls of granulated gelatine, one-half cupful of cold water, 
whites of two eggs, one-fourth cupful of powdered sugar, 
three-fourths cupful of scalded cream, two-thirds cupful 
of sugar, four bananas mashed to a pulp, one tablespoonful 
of lemon juice, whip three and one-half cupfuls of cream, 
twelve lady fingers. Soak gelatine in cold water, beat 
whites of eggs slightly, add powdered sugar, and grad- 
ually hot cream, cook over hot water until it thickens ; 
add soaked gelatine and remaining sugar, strain into a 
pan set in ice-water, add bananas and lemon juice, stir 
until it begins to thicken, then fold in whips from cream. 
Line a melon mould with lady fingers trimmed to just 
fit sections of mould, turn in the mixture, spread evenly, 
and chill. 



Cheap Custard.— 187. 

One tablespoonful of corn flour, one pint of milk, the 
yolks of two eggs, two ounces of castor sugar, vanilla 
or other flavoring. Put the milk and sugar on to boil. 
When boiling, stir in the corn flour, which should be 
mixed very smoothly with a little cold milk ; boil, stirring 
all the time for ten minutes ; then remove from the fire, 
and when it has cooled a little beat in the yolks of the 
eggs. Stir again over the fire to cook the eggs, but take 
care they do not curdle. Flavor to taste, and when cold 
pour into custard glasses. A cheaper substitute for 
custard may be made by omitting the eggs. 



— 8o — 

Chocolate Custard. — 188. 
One-fourth pound of chocolate, one-fourth pound of 
sugar crushed and sifted, a pint and a half of good 
milk, four eggs, six drops of vanilla. Take a clean 
saucepan, put in it the crushed chocolate and sugar, 
pour the milk over by degrees, thoroughly stirring all 
the time. Let it boil up, still stirring. Move it to the 
side of the fire to stand simmering for twenty minutes. 
Break four eggs separately; take the yolks of four and 
the whites of three and mix them with the cream, being 
careful it is not too hot. Strain the whole through a 
fine strainer into a jug. Stand in a saucepan of boiling 
water and keep stirring the same way until the custard 
thickens; it will take about twenty minutes after the 
water in the saucepan boils. When it is thick enough 
take it out of the hot water and leave it in the jug until 
cold. Stir a teaspoonful of vanilla into the cream. 
Serve when required in a glass dish or in custard cups, 
and pass sponge cake with it. 

German Puffs.— 189. 

To one pint of milk add six eggs well beaten, four 
tablespoonfuls of flour, one spoonful of melted butter, 
and a grated nutmeg. Mix these ingredients well, 
leaving out the whites of three eggs for sauce. Pour 
the mixture into cups well buttered, filling them half 
full. Bake in a quick oven. Turn them on a dish and 
pour the sauce over them. 

SAUCE. 

The whites of the three eggs madt into a thin icing 
with crushed sugar, to which add lemon juice or rose- 
water. 



strawberry Shortcake. — 190. 

Two cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
two small tablespoonfuls of butter, a pinch of salt, milk 
enough to make a soft dough. Do not roll, but pat in 
place with the hand. Can be split and fruit put between, 
or baked in a thinner cake in a large tin, which will 
make it more crusty. Butter well and spread plenty of 
berries between and on top. 

Chocolate Cream Qlace. — 191. 

Put into a saucepan over the fire one gill of water, six 
ounces of sugar and three ounces of grated chocolate. 
Boil until thick and smooth ; take off the fire, and add 
the whites of two eggs without beating. Use this while 
hot, covering the sides and top of the cake. It firms as 
it cools. 

Salted Almonds.— 192. 

After shelling almonds, pour boiling water upon them 
and let them remain in it until the skin begins to loosen, 
which will be soon. Rub the almonds in a clean towel 
to remove the skins; put the blanched almonds into a 
pan with enough butter to prevent burning (very little 
will sufKce), and put the pan into a quick oven. Watch 
the almonds and shake the pan frequently, so that they 
may brown equally. When they are delicately and 
evenly colored, take them up, let them cool, and then 
dust a little salt over them and use them as a relish at 
luncheon or dinner, or serve them as a course with some 
fine sherry or Madeira. 



PUDDING SAUCES. 

German Pudding Sauce. — 193. 

Dissolve one and one-half ounces of sugar in two 
glasses of white wine ; when quite hot, stir in the well- 
beaten yolks of three eggs; whisk it up until quite 
frothy and pour hot over the pudding. Whilst you 
whisk, keep the saucepan well to the side of the fire, as, if 
this sauce boils, it will curdle. 

Sauce. — 194. 

Half a cupful of milk, stir in two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, beat the whites of two eggs to a slight froth and 
stir in. Flavor with vanilla before serving. 

Wine Sauce. — 195. 

One-half cupful of butter, one cupful of powdered 
sugar, three tablespoonfuls of sherry or Madeira wine, 
slight grating of nutmeg. Cream the butter, add the 
sugar gradually and wine slowly ; pile on a glass dish and 
sprinkle with grated nutmeg. 

Hard Sauce.— 196. 

Beat to a cream one-fourth of a pound of butter, add 
gradually one-fourth of a pound of sugar ; heat it until 
very white; add a little lemon juice, or grate nutmeg on 
top. 



-83- 

Wine Sauce.— 197. 

One cupful of boiling water, one tablespoonful of corn- 
starch, one-fourth cupful of butter, one cupful of pow- 
dered sugar, one egg, one saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
one-half cupful of wine. Wet the corn-starch in cold 
water and stir into the boiling water. Boil ten minutes. 
Rub the butter to a cream, add the sugar gradually, then 
the egg, well beaten, and the nutmeg. When the corn- 
starch has cooked ten minutes, add the wine and pour the 
whole into the butter, sugar and egg, stirring until well 
mixed. 

Orange Sauce. — 198. 

Five large oranges, six lumps of sugar, one wineglass- 
ful of curagoa, one dessertspoonful of arrowroot. Rub the 
sugar on the oranges to absorb the zest. Put it into a 
stewpan and add the strained juice of the oranges. Mix 
the arrowroot smoothly with the curagoa and mix in. 
Boil the sauce and it is ready. If too thick, add more 
orange juice. 

Sauce for Puddings. — 199. 

One breakfastcupful of milk, two small teaspoonfuls 
of flour, one egg, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, a few drops 
of essence of lemon, small piece of butter. Mix the flour 
and milk together, put it into a small saucepan and stir 
till it boils. Beat the egg and sugar together. Let the 
milk cool slightly and add it to the egg and sugar. Add 
the butter. Return all to the saucepan and stir till it 
gets a little thick, but do not let it boil. Add the essence 
of lemon. 



-84- 

Oold Sauce for Puddings.— 200. 

Four ounces of butter, six ounces of sugar, white of an 
egg, one wineglassful of wine. Flavor with nutmeg or 
vanilla. 

German Sauce. — 201. 

The whites of two eggs, the juice of one lemon, sugar 
enough to beat up to a proper consistency for serving. 

Foaming Pudding Sauce. — 202. 

Whites of three eggs well beaten, one teacupful of 
sugar, one-third of a cupful of water, one glass of wine. 
Melt and boil the sugar in the water. Add the wine and 
stir in the whites. Serve at once. 



Cherry Sauce.— 203. 

Take thoroughly ripe and stoned cherries, pour over 
them melted sugar while boiling hot, in the proportion 
of half a pound of sugar to a pound of cherries. Put 
them on ice till cold, when the sauce is ready for the 
table. 

Maple Sugar Sauce.— 204. 

Break half a pound of maple sugar into small bits, put 
it into a thick saucepan with half a gill of cold water, set 
the saucepan over the fire, and melt the sugar until it 
forms a clear syrup ; then remove it from the fire, and 
stir in two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter cut into 
small bits. Serve the sauce hot with any fruit. 



-8s- 

Dinah's Charming Sauce. — 205. 

One small cupful of sifted sugar, half the quantity of 
butter, one large cupful of boiling milk, one dessert- 
spoonful of ground cinnamon. Stir the butter and 
sugar to a cream; then stir in the cinnamon and the 
boiling milk ; stir briskly till smooth, then pour into the 
sauce boat. May be eaten hot or cold. 

Molasses Sauce.— 206. 

Put one-half pint of molasses to boil in a skillet with 
a piece of butter the size of an egg ; when it has boiled 
a few minutes, pour in a teacupful of cream, and grate 
in half a nutmeg. This is the most economical way of 
making sauce. 

Pudding Sauce.— 207. 

One dessertspoonful of flour, one tablespoonful of 
sugar, one breakfastcupful of milk and water. Mix all these 
ingredients in a small saucepan, put it on the fire, and 
stir constantly till it boils. A little seasoning, such as 
ginger, cinnamon or nutmeg may be added. 

Lemon Sauce. — 208. 

One small lemon, one large teaspoonful of corn flour, 
one teacupful of water, one tablespoonful of sugar, a 
little cochineal or carmine. Put into an enameled 
saucepan the corn flour and sugar, and mix; then add 
the juice of the lemon and mix, then the water and 
coloring ; stir over the fire till it boils. Pour round the 
puddings, and serve. 



ICES AND ICE CREAM. 

Apple Ice.— 209. 

Take one pound of green cooking apples ; peel, core 
and cut into slices ; cook them over the fire soft with the 
juice of half a lemon and two tablespoonfuls of sugar; 
then pass them through a sieve. Add four tablespoon- 
fuls of clarified sugar and freeze. 

Cherry Water Ice.— 210. 

Bruise about a pound and a half of ripe cherries in a 
mortar, and put them into a pan with five ounces of 
sugar. Boil for a few minutes and rub through a sieve 
into a basin ; then add a pint of syrup and half a pint of 
cold water. Freeze and mould the ice. 

Lemon Water Ice. — 211. 

Take three lemons and rasp them on sugar, the juice 
of six lemoris, the juice of one orange, one pint of 
clarified sugar and half a pint of water. Mix ; strain 
through a hair or lawn sieve ; freeze. One quart. Or, 
take a sufficient quantity of lemons, six or eight to one 
quart, rasp three or four of them on a lump of sugar 
and scrape it into the vessel you are about to mix in, 
squeeze the lemons and add the juice of two oranges, 
half a pint of water and one pint of clarified sugar ; 
Strain; freeze. 



-87- 

Ohinese Ice.— 212. 

Beat the yolks of fifteen eggs with three-quarters of a 
pound of powdered sugar ; pound four ounces of pis- 
tachio-nuts (blanched) with the white of an egg ; put to 
it three gills of water; stir it over the fire in a double 
boiler till it is as thick as cream ; take great care that it 
does not boil. Color it green, or part green and part 
yellow; flavor as you please; cut up a couple of candied 
Chinese oranges small, and a little preserved ginger, and 
freeze. 

Peach Ice Cream.— 213. 

Take perfectly ripe freestone peaches, pare them, and 
mash them fine ; make them very sweet, and measure 
the peaches — to each quart add one quart of rich cream 
or milk; crack half a dozen stones, and mash the 
kernels fine, and put into the cream and freeze. Splen- 
did. 

Raspberry Ice Cream. — 214. 

The juice only must be used in making raspberry ice 
cream, about one pint of juice to one quart of cream 
and a light pound of sugar. The red Antwerp raspberry, 
when blended with the cream, produces a lovely color, 
and has exquisite fragrance as well as delicate flavor, 
but even the juice of the common wild raspberry makes 
a very nice variety in the matter of creams. In winter, 
canned raspberries, or even raspberry jam, put into a small 
sieve, and the juice from them strained into cream, 
will prove most satisfactory. Allow five ounces of 
sugar to a quart of the flavored cream, if the fruit has 
not been sweetened ; otherwise, sweeten to taste. 



— 88 — 

Tutti Prutti Ice Cream.— 215. 

Make a very rich custard — a caramel custard is best 
for the purpose, following the usual rule of making it 
one-third sweeter than if it were not to be frozen — and 
stir in some candied fruit, chopped fine, regulating the 
quantity by the quantity of custard ; freeze as usual. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. — 216. 

One quart of cream, one pint of new milk, two cupfuls 
of sugar, two eggs beaten very light, five tablespoon- 
fuls of chocolate rubbed smooth in a little milk. Heat 
the milk nearly to boiling, and pour slowly in with the 
beaten egg and sugar. Stir in the chocolate, beat well 
three minutes, and return to the inner kettle. Heat 
until it thickens well, stirring constantly ; take from the 
fire and set aside to cool. When the custard is cold, 
beat in the cream and freeze. 

Plain Ice Cream. — 217. 

The sort of ice cream usually made at home is com- 
posed of milk, with a small proportion of cream, with 
eggs and sugar added to it ; for instance, dissolve half a 
pound of sugar in a quart of milk, place it over the fire, 
and let it heat to the boiling point ; meantime beat three 
eggs to a cream, pour the boiling milk into them, and 
then return to the fire, and stir it until it begins to 
thicken ; then at once remove it from the fire, stir it until 
it is smooth ; then flavor it, cool it, and, when it is cool, 
freeze it, according to directions given, in the freezer.

-89- 

Neapolitan Ice Cream.— 218. 
For this a proper mould is necessary ; lay three ice 
creams differently flavored and colored in it, in layers. 
Choose flavors that will go well together. Freeze for an 
hour. 

Strawberry Ice Cream.— 219. 

One pint of milk, four eggs, one and one-half pints of 
fresh strawberries, one quart of cream, one-half pound 
of sugar. Beat the eggs until very light, make the milk 
hot, and pour it over them. Pour these together into a 
saucepan, and stir them over the fire until the eggs begin 
to thicken. Transfer the custard to a bowl and allow it 
to cool. In the meantime place the strawberries into a 
hair sieve, sprinkle over them a little sugar, and then rub 
them through the sieve with the back of a wooden 
spoon. When this is done, add the sugar to the syrup 
so formed, and when the custard has become quite cold, 
stir the fruit mixture into it. Add the cream, and, stirring 
this well through the custard, pour all into a freezer, and 
freeze until quite solid, stirring the cream down from the 
sides from time to time, to keep it smooth while freezing, 
unless the freezer be arranged to do this while being 
turned. 

Ratifla Ice Cream.— 220. 

Take one pint of cream, a little milk, four ounces of 
sugar, the yolks of two eggs, two ounces of ratifias ; 
put them into a stewpan over a gentle fire; set as thin as 
custard. Add the juice of half a lemon ; when cold, 
freeze; take two ounces more ratifias, rub through a 
sieve, and add when the former is frozen, together with 
one glass of noyau or maraschino. One quart. 



— 90 — 

Italian Cream. — 221. 

Put two pints of cream into two bowls. With that in 
one bowl mix six ounces of powdered loaf sugar, the juice 
of two large lemons, and two glasses of white wine. Then 
add the other pint of cream, and stir the whole very- 
hard. Boil two ounces of gelatine with four small tea- 
cupfuls of water, till it is reduced to one half Then stir 
the gelatine lukewarm into the other ingredients, and 
put them into a glass dish to congeal. 

Velvet Cream.— 222. 

Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in a gill of water ; 
add to it half a pint of light sherry, grated lemon peel 
and the juice of one lemon, and five ounces of sugar.

bowl or pan three pounds of the flour, and mix with it 
the salt. Put the yeast cake into a bowl, and, covering 
it with the tepid water, let it dissolve. Make a hole in 
the center of the flour and into this pour the yeast and 
water, pouring it through a strainer to remove any 
remaining lump. Stir into this from the side the dry 
flour until it becomes smooth, and, covering the bowl, 
place it in a warm, dry place, giving its contents two 
hours in which to rise. At the end of this time sprinkle 
the remaining half pound of flour over the light dough, 
and knead all together until the dough cleaves cleanly 
from the sides of the bowl or pan. Divide the dough 
into two equal parts, mould these into loaves, and, 
greasing slightly two bread-pans, place the loaves 
therein, and set them in a warm place for half an hour 
to rise. When this time expires place the bread-pans 
in a moderate oven, and bake the bread for one hour 
and a half When done, the bread should be placed 
upon the sieve or folded towel to cool before being put 
away; otherwise, being put into a close place hot, the 
steam which it generates will make it damp and heavy 
and inclined to crumble when dry.

add the milk and butter, make a stiff paste. When quite 
light, knead it well, roll it out an inch thick, cut it with 
a tumbler, prick them with a fork, bake in buttered pans 
with a quick heat. Split and butter before sending them 
to the table. 

Rusks.— 278. 

One cupful of milk, scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
cupful of yeast, two cupfuls of flour. Mix into a sponge 
at night or very early in the morning. When well 
risen, add flour enough to make a stiff dough. Knead 
and let it rise again, then add one-fourth cup of butter 
rubbed to a cream, half a cup of sugar, and one egg 
beaten with butter and sugar. Let it rise in the bowl 
till light. Shape into small, round biscuit ; put them 
close together in a shallow cake pan, that they may rise 
very high. When ready to bake, rub the tops with 
sugar dissolved in milk, sprinkle with dry sugar and 
bake in a moderate oven.

Baking-powder Biscuits.— 279. 

One quart of flour, four heaping teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing-powder, a little salt ; mix the powder and salt well into 
the flour. Wet up with sweet milk stiff enough to roll, 
but do not knead. Cut with biscuit cutter and bake 
fifteen minutes. They are much nicer than with short- 
ening. If desired, one can use a piece of lard the size of 
an English walnut, well rubbed into the flour. 

Milk RoUs.— 280. 
One pound of flour, two ounces of butter, two heaping 
teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, enough milk to mix to a 
dough. Rub the butter into the flour lightly, add the 
baking-powder and mix with the milk. Make into 
small rolls as soon as possible, and bake for a few min- 
utes in a quick oven. Brush over with a little milk to 
glaze them. 

Passion Biscuits.— 281. 
One pound of flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of 
salt and a little new milk. Rub the butter into the 
flour, then the salt ; moisten with the milk. Put it into 
the mortar, and beat the paste for twenty minutes, then 
cut it into pieces the size of walnuts. Roll into little 
balls, then roll these pieces out as thin as a sixpence, 
prick them, then bake in a quick oven, watching them 
till of a light brown color. 

Waffles.— 282. 
Four eggs, one quart of sweet milk, one quart of 
flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of butter. 
Beat eggs separately, and bake quick. 



— Ill — 

Buns.— 283. 
Sixteen ounces of flour, half an ounce of yeast, half a 
pint of milk, two ounces of sugar, two ounces of sul- 
tanas, two ounces of butter, one egg. Put ten ounces of 
flour into a basin. Mix the yeast smoothly with the 
milk, which should be made tepid. Stir into the flour. 
Beat for five minutes, and set to rise in a warm place for 
about two hours. Then beat in the remainder of the 
flour, sultanas, sugar, butter and egg. Set to rise for 
about two hours more. Then form into buns. Place 
them on a floured tin and let them rise for ten minutes. 
Bake in a very quick oven for five minutes until nicely 
colored. Boil half an ounce of sugar with half a gill of 
water, and brush the buns over with this to glaze them. 

Soda Scones.— 284. 

One pound of flour, nearly a teaspoonful of carbonate 
of soda, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, buttermilk. Rub the soda and salt till 
they are quite smooth, and mix them thoroughly well 
with the flour; add sufificient buttermilk to form into a 
little dough. Turn the dough onto a floured board 
and knead it a little ; then form into two rounds half an 
inch in thickness, cut each round into four scones across 
and across and bake on a floured griddle not too hot. 

Potato Scones.— 285. 

Six or eight potatoes, flour, salt and a little sugar. 
Peel and boil the potatoes, with salt in the water; 
steam and mash. Take out a large tablespoonful on the 
bakeboard, and add to it half a teaspoonful of sugar and 



112 

one tablespoonful of flour. Knead this until it feels 
firm (it will take up nearly all the flour), then sprinkle 
some flour on the board, roll it round and quite thin. 
Cut it into quarters, prick all over with a fork, and put 
the scones on a hot griddle for about five minutes. 
Serve hot. Potatoes get out of season in the spring of 
the year, and are then not so suitable for making scones. 

Quick Sally Lunn.— 286. 

Three eggs, one-half cupful of butter, one cupful of 
milk, three cupfuls of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking- 
powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt. Stir the melted 
butter into the beaten yolks, then add the flour, which 
must have the baking-powder sifted into it. Add the 
well-beaten whites last, and bake in a loaf in a steady 
oven. 

Graham Meal Griddles.— 287. 

One quart of sweet milk, two cupfuls of graham flour, 
one cupful of white flour, one teaspoonful of salt, two 
spoonfuls of nice molasses, half a cake of compressed 
yeast or half a cup of fluid yeast. Stir the milk to the 
graham and flour; add salt, molasses and yeast. Beat all 
together, and set in a warm place to rise overnight. In the 
morning beat well and set near the fire for a second 
rising. When everything is ready for breakfast, dissolve 
half a teaspoonful of soda and stir into it. Bake them 
on a griddle greased only enough to keep them from 
sticking. Bake both sides a nice brown. Do not turn 
them twice. Serve only a few at a time. These are 
much more nourishing and wholesome than any buck- 
wheat griddles. 



— IIS-— 

Rice Pancakes.— 288. 

Have ready a pint of rice, boiled quite soft; sift to- 
gether a pint of flour and one teaspoonful each of baking- 
powder and salt ; beat three eggs, and mix them with a 
pint of milk. Before putting these ingredients together, 
see that the griddle is hot ; then mix the pancakes, and 
begin to bake them at once. If the first ones seem too 
stiff, add a little more milk to the pancake batter. 
Serve the pancakes hot, as fast as they are done. 



Johnnycake. — 289. 

One and one-half cupfuls of meal, one and one-half 
cupfuls of flour, three teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, 
one-half cupful of butter, not quite one-half cupful of 
sugar, three eggs, two cupfuls of sweet milk. Beat but- 
ter and sugar, then eggs, then milk, lastly meal and flour 
with baking-powder mixed in. Bake one-half hour. 



Raised Buckwheat Cakes.— 290. 

Mix the following ingredients to a smooth batter at 
night : one quart of buckwheat flour, one gill each of 
liquid yeast and molasses, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
enough lukewarm water to make a thick batter. Put the 
batter into an earthen jar or pitcher, cover it with a 
folded towel, and let it stand in a warm place over- 
night. The next morning, fry the cakes. If the batter 
is at all sour, stir into it a saltspoonful of baking soda 
dissolved in a little warm water before cooking the cakes. 



— 114 — 

Flannel Cakes.— 291. 

Beat six eggs very light, stir into them two pounds of 
flour, one gill of yeast, a small spoonful of salt, and suffi- 
cient milk to make a thick batter. Make them at night 
for breakfast, and at ten in the morning for tea. Have 
your griddle hot, grease it well, and bake as buckwheat. 
Butter and send them hot to the table, commencing 
after the family are seated. 

Hoecake.— 292. 

Three spoonfuls of small hominy or grits, two spoon- 
fuls of rice flour, a teaspoonful of butter, and milk suffi- 
cient to make the mixture into a thin batter (half a pint 
would be the proper thing), a saltspoonful of salt. 
Bake on a hoe or hot griddle. 

Vienna Rolls.— 293. 

Mix one ounce of dry German yeast with one ounce 
of pounded sugar and two ounces of butter; then stir into 
it one pint of warm milk. Have two pounds of flour 
mixed with two eggs and some salt. Stir the milk and 
yeast gradually into the flour; mix it all up very thor- 
oughly. Let it stand in a warm place for three hours ; 
then divide it into small shapes. Flour some tins; place 
the rolls upon them, and let them stand for about twenty 
minutes in a warm place. Bake in a quick oven for about 
fifteen minutes ; rub them over with a little sugar and 
water, and finish baking a few minutes longer. 



PICKLES. 

Pickles.— 294. 

Wash one hundred small cucumbers in cold water, 
dry them in a cloth, and put them in a butter firkin or 
an unglazed crock. Boil two gallons of water, and add 
a pound and a quarter of coarse kitchen salt; skim 
until clear, and pour it on the cucumbers; let them 
remain in the brine three days ; drain them in a colander. 
Wash out the vessel, and put into it a sliced raw onion, 
three green peppers sliced, a tablespoonful of mustard 
seed, a tablespoonful each of whole cloves, pepper-corns, 
and allspice. Now add the cucumbers, and pour over 
them two gallons of boiling cider vinegar. The spices 
may be put into a thin cloth bag if desired ; and if you 
wish to have the pickles brittle, add a bit of alum the 
size of two peas. The cucumbers may remain in the 
brine for days, but should be soaked in fresh water 
before pickling. 

Peach Pickle.— 295. 

Peel peaches ; let them stand in cold water until you 
have prepared the vinegar after the following recipe : to 
one peck of peaches, one tablespoonful of ground cori- 
ander seed, one tablespoonful of ground cinnamon, one 
tablespoonful of ground ginger, one tablespoonful of 
ground celery seed, one tablespoonful of ground mace, 
one tablespoonful of ground black pepper, two table- 



— ii6 — 

spoonfuls of whole white mustard seed, one-half gallon 
of cider vinegar. Allow one-half pound of sugar to 
each pound of fruit. Put all on the fire together ; as 
soon as it boils, drop in the peaches ; boil till tender ; 
take them out carefully, and put into jars. Pour boiling 
vinegar and spices over them ; cover closely. 

Pickled Onions.— 296. 

Take small button onions, peel them, and throw them 
into salt and water for twenty-four hours ; then put them 
on the fire in a porcelain-lined preserving kettle, with 
fresh salt and water, and let them come to a boil. Re- 
move from the fire, pour off the water, put the onions into 
a large crock, and pour over them the scalding hot 
vinegar, which must have been scalded with mace, whole 
pepper-corns, red pepper pods, spices (all unground), a 
tablespoonful of sugar, and salt to taste. Cover the 
crock and set away until cold ; then bottle. 

Pickled French Beans.— 297. 

French beans, vinegar, a blade of mace, two ounces 
each of whole pepper and ginger. Gather the beans 
when they are young, and put into a strong salt and 
water until they become yellow. Drain the salt from 
them, and wipe them quite dry. Then put them into a 
stone jar with a small piece of alum ; boil the vinegar 
with the mace, ginger and whole pepper, and pour it 
boiling on the beans every twenty-four hours, preventing 
the escape of steam. Continue this for a few days until 
they become green. Put them by in bottles for use. 



— 117 — 

Green Pickle.— 298. 

Cucumbers, snap-beans, gherkins, green fox grapes 
and tomatoes are principally used for this pickle. Put 
your materials in brine that will bear an egg. Let them 
remain so a fortnight, or as long as you choose, for they 
may remain for six months or even a year thus without 
injury if you only see to it that they are well covered up 
with grape leaves weighted down upon them and sub- 
merged in brine. When you are ready to pickle, take 
them out and soak them in weak vinegar for several 
days, then scald them in strong spiced vinegar 
(which will be sufficient for a peck of pickles), put four 
ounces of long pepper, one ounce of cloves, four ounces 
of mustard seed (half white, half black), one ounce of 
mace, two ounces of celery seed, six red pepper pods, a 
handful of horse-radish ; sweeten to your taste. Three 
pounds would not be too much for most modern tastes. 

Lord Higden's Pickle.— 299. 

Take three quarts of chopped cucumbers, four 
quarts of chopped onions, four quarts of chopped green 
and red peppers mixed, one pint of table salt ; mix all 
together, and let it remain in a jar for twelve hours ; put 
it into a sieve and press all the juice out as dry as 
possible. Have half a gallon of good vinegar scalding hot, 
into which put four tablespoonfuls of white mustard 
seed, four tablespoonfuls of black pepper, cloves and 
allspice, three large tablespoonfuls of olive oil. Pack the 
pickle in an open-mouth jar, and pour the boiling 
vinegar over it. Stir frequently for two weeks. This is an 
English recipe, and very good. 



— Ii8 — 

Green Tomato Pickle.— 300. 

One peck of green tomatoes, twenty-four large cu- 
cumbers, twelve large onions. Chop these ingredients 
very fine, salt well and hang out in the air overnight; 
this will allow all juice to drain off. The next morning 
place the chopped ingredients in a kettle and cover with the 
best cider vinegar and let come to a boil. Put into jars 
and leave until celery time in the fall ; then take one 
dozen bunches of celery, chop very fine and add spices ; 
two pounds of stick cinnamon, two pounds of white 
mustard seed, and red pepper to taste; to each pint 
of this mixture add one pint of sugar and boil all 
together before putting into jars. 

Pickled Peaches.— 301. 

Choose perfectly sound peaches of medium size ; 
brush them all over with a soft brush. Boil together 
six quarts of water and a pint of coarse salt, and skim it 
until it is clear; then cool it. The quantity may be 
increased or diminished to suit the quantity of peaches, 
enough being used to cover the peaches, but this pro- 
portion of salt and water must be used. When the 
brine is cold, put the peaches into it, and let them stand 
for forty-eight hours. Then rinse them in a clean water, 
dry them on a soft towel, and stick half a dozen cloves 
into each one. Boil, and skim till clear, as much vinegar 
as will well cover the peaches — the quantity may be 
gauged by measuring the brine — allowing for each 
quart of vinegar four blades of mace and a quarter of an 
ounce of stick cinnamon. When the vinegar has boiled 
about fifteen minutes, put in the peaches, and remove 



— 119 — 

the preserving kettle containing them to the back of the 
fire, where its contents will not boil. Let the peaches 
stand in the hot vinegar for five minutes, and then put 
both peaches and vinegar at once into glass jars, and 
seal them air-tight. Sweet pickled peaches are made by 
allowing a pound of brown sugar to each pint of vinegar, 
and boiling the sugar with the vinegar and spices. 

Tomato Catchup.— 302. 

One peck of ripe tomatoes, one ounce of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of cayenne pepper, one tablespoonful each of 
black pepper, powdered cloves and celery seed in a bag, 
seven tablespoonfuls of ground mustard, half an ounce 
of mace. Cut the tomatoes into halves, and put in the 
preserving kettle. Boil until the pulp is dissolved. 
Press through a hair sieve. Return to the fire, add the 
seasoning and boil four hours, stirring frequently. 
When cold, add a pint of strong vinegar. Take out the 
celery seed, and bottle, sealing the corks. Keep in a 
cool, dark place. 

Walnut Catchup.- 303. 

Gather the walnuts as for pickling and put them in salt 
and water for ten days ; then pound them in a mortar 
and to every dozen walnuts put a quart of strong 
vinegar and stir it every day for a week ; then strain it 
through a bag, and to every quart of liquor put a tea- 
spoonful of pounded mace, the same of cloves and a few 
pieces of garlic or onion; boil it twenty minutes and 
when cold bottle it. White or black walnuts are as good 
for catchup as the English walnut, and will keep good for 
several years. 



— 120 — 

Grape Catchup. — 304. 

Boil five pounds of grapes and press through a col- 
ander. Add two and a half pounds of sugar, one pint 
of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, one table- 
spoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of salt. Boil until 
thick. 

Plum Catchup.— 305. 

Take one peck of plums, cut them into halves, and take 
out the stones ; then add to them seven pounds of extra 
C sugar, one-half pint of vinegar, two tablespoonfuls of 
ground cloves, two tablespoonfuls of allspice and two 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon. Boil all together one hour, 
then bottle it. 

Chutney.— 306. 

One pound of tomatoes, four ounces of raisins, four 
ounces of powdered ginger, four ounces of brown sugar, 
half an ounce of garlic, one ounce of shallots, four 
ounces of apples pared and cored, two ounces of chillies, 
four ounces of salt. Pound the raisins, chillies, shallots 
and garlic separately. Break up the tomatoes and mix 
the whole together; put into ajar and add two quarts of 
vinegar. Place the jar, covered over, on the stove and 
let the pickle remain a month at a moderate heat, stirring 
it every day. Strain off and bottle the liquor for use 
with any fish, cold meat, etc., and for flavoring hashes, 
mince, etc. Then put the sediment, which is the chut- 
ney, and must not be drained too dry, into pickle 
bottles. After keeping a few months it will be improved 
by the addition of a little more vinegar or Chili vinegar. 



— 121 — 



PiccaliUi.— 307. 



One peck of green tomatoes (if the flavor of onions is 
desired, take eight, but it is very nice without any), four 
green peppers. Slice all and put in layers, sprinkle on one 
cupful of salt and let them remain overnight. In the 
morning press dry through a sieve, put it in a porcelain 
kettle and cover with vinegar, add one cupful of sugar, a 
tablespoonful of each kind of spice ; put into a muslin 
bag ; stew slowly about an hour, or until the tomatoes 
are as soft as you desire. 

Ohowchow. — 308. 

Take a peck of cucumbers, a peck of onions, half a peck 
of string beans, three heads of cauliflower, three bunches 
of celery, half ■< dozen sweet peppers ; soak the whole 
in strong <-alt . ' ^i.er overnight. In the morning, drain 
off the brine and scald them all in weak salt and water, 
but before scalding cut them into shape so that they will 
go easily into glass jars ; add three-fourths of a pound 
of mustard, two packages of curry powder and six 
quarts of good vinegar ; put the mustard and curry 
powder into vinegar and let it come to a boil ; put the 
pickles into the cans and pour the liquid over them 
while hot. Do not cover while scalding. 

To Qreen Pickles.— 309. 

To a piece of alum the size of an ordinary walnut 
add one gallon of water. Put the cucumbers in, and let 
them stand half a day, then take them and throw them 
into cold water. An easy way to green all pickles is to 
boil them in strong ginger tea. 



— 122 — 

To Pickle Red Cabbage.— 310. 

Choose the cabbage of a deep red color, take off the 
outer leaves and cut the heart into strips. Put a layer 
of cabbage into a sieve, sprinkle it with salt; then another 
layer of cabbage and of salt until it is all used ; when it 
has stood twenty-four hours, squeeze and put it into a 
jar. If convenient, add a beet sliced ; it may be used 
raw, but it is better if baked or boiled. For a large 
cabbage, boil an ounce of whole ginger crushed, an 
ounce of black pepper-corns and half an ounce of allspice 
in a pint of vinegar for ten minutes. Mix this with the 
cabbage and fill up the jar with vinegar. Let it stand 
for a day, then fasten down and keep as air-tight as 
possible. 

Herb Powder for Winter Use. — 311. 

Two ounces of sweet marjoram, two ounces of winter 
savory; two ounces of thyme; four ounces of pars- 
ley ; two ounces of lemon peel. After the herbs are all 
thoroughly dry, pick off the leaves, pound them to a 
powder, and then sift them through a sieve. Mix all 
well together, adding the lemon peel dried and pounded 
as fine as the leaves. Keep it in glass bottles for use, 
tightly corked down. All other herbs dried and pounded 
are better kept in separate bottles, and added when 
required. 



PRESERVES. 

Grape Jam.— 312. 

Wash the grapes and squeeze or pinch the pulps from 
the skins. Boil the pulp until it separates from the seeds, 
and rub it through a sieve. Then add the skins to the pulp, 
and boil with an equal weight of sugar fifteen minutes. 
Put into small jars or tumblers and cover with paper. 

Plum Jam.— 313. 

The plums must be quite ripe, so as to be easily- 
stoned. Boil them for forty minutes, stirring all the 
time ; add to this three-fourths pound of sugar to every 
pound of plums, and one-fourth of the kernels blanched 
and pounded, and boil twenty minutes longer. Pour into 
pots, and cover hot. 

Gooseberry Jam,— 314. 

Six pounds of gooseberries, six pounds of preserving 
sugar. Pick, top and tail red gooseberries, thoroughly 
ripe. Boil them for twenty minutes, skimming frequently 
as required. Add the sugar. Boil for half an hour 
after the sugar is added. Skim well, and pour hot into 
earthenware jars. If it be wished that the gooseberries 
should remain whole, dissolve the sugar in a little water 
or currant juice, and as soon as the sugar is melted and 
clear put in the gooseberries. Shake the pan to prevent 
the jam burning. If it is stirred, the fruit may break. 

123 



— 124 — 

Black Currant Jam. — 315. 
Time, three-fourths hour to one hour. To every pound 
of currants allow three-fourths pound of sugar. Gather 
the currants when they are thoroughly ripe and dry, and 
pick them from the stalks. Bruise them lightly in a 
large bowl, and to every pound of fruit put three-fourths 
pound fine beaten loaf sugar; put sugar and fruit into a 
preserving pan, and boil them from three-fourths to one 
hour, skimming as the scum rises, and stirring constantly ; 
then put the jam into pots, cover them with brandy 
paper, and tie them closely over. 

Rhubarb Jam. — 316. 
Take the rhubarb, peel and cut it as for a tart, put it 
into a preserving kettle and boil for a quarter of an 
hour. Then put in sugar in the proportion of three- 
fourths of a pound to a pound of fruit, and to each pound 
four bitter almonds blanched and split into halves. Boil 
for a full hour longer, or until it is a beautiful green and 
very thick. Almonds that have been used for making 
flavoring are best for this purpose, and with them the jam 
is an excellent substitute for green gage jam. There are 
many sorts of rhubarb ; avoid large, coarse growths, and 
be sure it is perfectly fresh. The later in the season 
rhubarb jam can be made the better ; the second growth, 
having more fibre and less juice than the first, makes a 
stronger preserve. 

Raspberry Jam.— 317. 

Four pounds of raspberries, five pounds of sugar one 

pint of red currant juice. Put the juice and sugar on to 

boil, stirring all the time ; add the fruit all picked nicely. 

Boil for twenty minutes or so after it boils. Put into pots. 



— 125 — 

Preserved Peaches. — 318. 

Fill a four-quart steamer with perfectly sound peaches ; 
place the steamer on top of a pot of fast boiling water 
for three minutes, then remove, and allow the fruit to 
become cold; peel them carefully and weigh them. 
Boil together three pounds of sugar and one pint of 
water ; remove all scum until quite clear. Soak a table- 
spoonful of a good gelatine in a gill of cold water ten 
minutes, drain off the cold water and add a pint of hot 
water. Add this to the sugar, and boil and skim until 
clear. If not clear enough, whisk into it the white and 
shell of one egg, and strain through a flannel bag, but 
this is hardly necessary for ordinary syrup used in pre- 
serving. Make an incision in one side of each peach 
down to the stone. Add four pounds of the peaches to 
the syrup, and boil five minutes. Scald the jars care- 
fully, so as not to crack them, then place them in a 
dripping-pan, and surround them with hot water. Fill 
the jars with the syrup, and put about nine peaches into 
each quart jar. Place the clean rubber band on each jar 
as fast as it is filled, and screw on the cover. Remove, 
and when they are cold test the covers to make them as 
tight as possible. (The gelatine is used only when a 
thick syrup is desirable.) 

Quince Preserves.— 319. 

Allow one pound and a quarter of loaf sugar to every 
pound of fruit, after they have been peeled and cut into 
halves ; to this add one pint of water. Keep the kettle 
covered until the quinces are done, take them out and 
spread on dishes, boil the syrup up once and pour hot 
over them. 



— 126 — 

Preserved Peaches. — 320. 

Fine yellow peaches pared and stoned; equal weight 
of loaf sugar with the pared and stoned peaches. Put 
a layer of loaf sugar at the bottom of a preserving 
kettle, then a layer of fruit, and so on until the kettle is 
full ; put the kettle in a cool corner of the range until 
the sugar is dissolved, then boil the fruit until it is clear 
and thoroughly cooked, then take out the pieces 
with a perforated skimmer and lay on dry dishes. Boil 
the syrup in the kettle until quite thick; fill the jars half 
full with fruit ; pour over the syrup, adding one-quarter 
of the kernels, which have been blanched and boiled 
until soft in enough water to barely cover them. When 
cold, cover them and close them as usual. 

Rhubarb Ginger.— 321. 

Six pounds of rhubarb, six pounds of lump sugar, two 
ounces of whole ginger. With a damp towel rub well 
the stalks of rhubarb; cut them into lengths. Place the 
ginger between the folds of a kitchen towel, and bruise 
it with a hammer. Place the ginger in a large basin, 
and place over it alternate layers of the rhubarb and 
sugar. Allow this to stand twenty-four hours. At the 
end of this time pour the syrup from the rhubarb. Pour 
the syrup into a preserving pan ; stir it over the fire until 
it boils. Pour the boiling syrup over the rhubarb, and 
allow this to stand twenty-four hours longer. Pour all 
now into a large preserving pan, place the pan over a 
brisk fire, and stir the contents until boiling. Skim well, 
draw the pan to one side, and let all simmer slowly half an 
hour, when the preserve is ready to pour into the pots. 



— 12/ — 

Canned Pea.— 322. 

The Bartlett pears or Flemish Beauties are preferred 
by many, but any good flavored pear will do. Pare 
them as thin as possible. If you wish them whole, 
remove the blossom end, and with a sharp knife cut part 
of the stem off. If cut into halves, cut out the cores, and 
cut so as to split the stem in two. Drop them into a 
bowl of cold water as they are pared. When ready, 
cover them with cold water, and boil until you can put a 
fork through easily. They may be steamed, which some 
think is better than boiling. Have ready a rich syrup 
made as in preserves, drop the pears in and cook a 
few moments ; then fill your cans, which stand in hot 
water, with the pears, and fill to running over with hot 
syrup. Screw the tops down quickly, set them upside 
down on the table. If you like them flavored, add 
ginger root or sliced lemons to the syrup and boil with 
it. 

Preserved Pieplant. — 323. 

Peel, and remove the seeds from, one-half dozen 
oranges; slice and put into a preserving kettle. Add one 
quart of pieplant cut into small pieces, and one and one- 
half pounds of sugar. Cook as for preserves. 

* Preserved Quinces.— 324. 
As you peel and core the quinces, throw them into 
cold water ; strain them out of the water and make a 
syrup. To a pint of water put a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit. When the syrup boils, put in fruit and 
boil until soft. Boil the syrup down as usual with other 
preserves. 



— 128 — 

Preserved Pigs.— 326. 

Take figs when perfectly ripe, and wipe them carefully, 
leaving the stem about half an inch long. Boil them 
rapidly for about ten minutes in water that has a bag 
of hickory wood ashes laid at the bottom of the pre- 
serving kettle. Then take them out carefully, so as not 
to break the skins. Wash out the kettle, and boil the 
figs a second time, in clean, hot water, for ten minutes. 
Take them out, spread them separately on large dishes, 
and let them rest till next morning. Prepare a syrup by 
allowing to every pound of the finest loaf sugar half a 
pint of water, and, when melted together, placing the 
kettle over the fire. When the syrup has boiled and is 
thoroughly skimmed, put in the figs and boil them about 
twenty-five minutes or half an hour. Then take them 
out, and again spread them to cool on large dishes. 
Afterward put them up in glass jars, pouring the syrup 
over them. Cover the jars closely, and set them in the 
hot sun all next day. Then seal the corks. 

Quince Jelly.— 326. 

Halve the quinces, and take out the cores. Boil the 
quinces in clear water till very soft ; mash them, and let 
them drain through a flannel bag without squeezing 
them. Put to the quince liquor, when drained through 
the bag, white sugar in the proportion of a pound to a 
pint of the liquor. Add the whites of eggs, and clarify 
it. When clear, boil it on a moderate fire, till it becomes 
a thick jelly. Fill glasses with the jelly, and cover 
them tight. The quince pulp that remains in the jelly- 
bag can be made into marmalade. 



— 129 — 

Red Currant Jelly.— 327. 

Gather the currants when they are dry, bruise them 
with the hand, put them into a brass pan, place it on the 
stove, stir the berries until they are hot, then pour into a 
jelly bag. When the juice has all run through, put it 
into a preserve pan. To every pint of juice allow one 
pound of crushed loaf sugar. Place the pan on the 
stove or clear fire, and stir all the time, removing the 
scum as it rises. Allow it to boil for about two minutes, 
then put it into pots. 

Cherries Preserved in Syrup.— 328. 

Choose light, sound cherries. Remove the stones 
without injuring the fruit, which may be done by 
drawing them out with the stalk, or pushing them out at 
one end with a bodkin or quill. Allow a pint and a 
half of water and a pound of sugar for every pound of 
fruit, weighed after it has been stoned. Put the sugar 
and water in a preserving pan, and let it boil for a 
quarter of an hour, skimming it carefully ; then throw in 
the fruit and let it boil for another quarter of an hour. 
Pour the fruit with the syrup into a large jar, and let it 
remain till next day, when the cherries must be put into 
a sieve to drain. Allow a pint of white currant juice for 
every four pounds of cherries. The juice and the syrup 
must be boiled together for fifteen minutes, when the 
cherries may be put in and boiled again for four or 
five minutes. Put the cherries into jars, cover them with 
the syrup, lay brandy papers on the top, and tie closely 
down. 



— ISO- 
Watermelon Rind.— 329. 

Cut off the outer rind and all of the red part from the 
inside ; cut the rind into strips or squares, and boil in a 
liberal quantity of syrup, allowing a pound and a quarter 
of sugar in a quart of water to the pound of rind. 
Bake the syrup first, and clarify it with white of an egg ; 
skim, and add the rind ; simmer until quite transparent, 
remove the rind, boil down the syrup one-third, then 
pour it over the rind. 

Clear Orange Jelly.— 330. 

Soak one ounce of gelatine in an English pint of cold 
water, add the juice of eight sweet oranges, one-half 
pound of lump sugar, the whites and shells of three 
eggs. Whisk all well together in a brass pan, and stir 
it on the fire until it boils for a few minutes; then pour 
it through a jelly bag; return it to the bag until it runs 
perfectly clear. Pour it into a mould, and when set 
turn it out upon its dish. 

Grab Apple Jelly.— 331. 

Wash and stem the apples, cut them into halves, put 
them over the fire in enough cold water to cover them, 
and stew them to a pulp ; then pour them into a jelly-bag, 
and let the juice drain from them. The apple pulp may 
be sweetened and used for luncheon. To make the jelly, 
allow a pound of sugar to a pint of juice; boil them 
together, removing all scum, for about twenty minutes, 
or until a little of the juice forms a jelly on being cooled. 
Then partly cool the jelly and put it up as already 
directed for jellies. 



— 131 — 

Claret Jelly.— 332. 

One ounce packet of gelatine, one pint of water, one 
pint of claret, one-half pound of lump sugar, a few drops 
of cochineal. Soak the gelatine in the water. Add the 
sugar and stir over the fire until dissolved. Pour in the 
wine, and color with cochineal. Strain into a wetted 
mould. When firm, dip into hot water for a second or 
two and turn onto a glass dish. This jelly is not 
clarified. Cake is usually served with claret jelly. 

Green Gage Plums.— 333. 

These make tarts next to gooseberry in excellence, if 
gathered while green, the seeds taken out with a pen- 
knife, and stewed for fifteen minutes with a pound of 
sugar for every pound of fruit. These may also 
be put up for winter use in self-sealing cans, just as 
gooseberries are. A delightful jam is furnished by 
stewing the seeded fruit alone for twenty minutes, then 
adding half a pound of sugar to each pound of plums 
and cooking them together until they are as thick a 
jam as you like. 

Canned Strawberries. — 334. 

After the berries are pulled, let as many as can be put 
carefully in the preserve kettle at once be placed on a 
platter. To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a 
pound of sugar ; let them stand two or three hours till 
the juice is drawn from them ; pour it into the kettle and 
let it come to a boil, and remove the scum which rises ; 
then put in the berries very carefully. As soon as they 
come thoroughly to a boil, put them in warm jars and 
seal while boiling hot. Be sure the cans are air-tight. 



— 132 — 

Orange Marmalade. — 335. 

Cut up twelve oranges into thin strips ; then put 
them into six quarts of water; allow them to stand 
twenty-four hours. Boil till reduced to half, then add 
eight pounds of loaf sugar. Boil one and a half hours, 
or till it sets. The seeds may be boiled in a pint of water 
two hours and added to the fruit when the sugar is put 
in ; also a few pieces of lemon peel. 

Canned Pineapples. — 386. 

Six pounds of fruit (after being cut), two and one-half 
pounds of sugar, three pints of water. Make a syrup 
of the sugar and water and boil for five minutes and 
skim or strain if necessary. Then add the fruit and let 
it boil up. Have cans hot; fill and shut up as soon as 
possible. As the cans cool, keep tightening them up. 

Canned Strawberries. — 337. 

Half a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit; put all 
on the fire and let them get boiling hot; put them imme- 
diately into glass jars (which must be hot) ; seal them 
up tight; keep jars in hot water while you fill them. 
Raspberries require only one-quarter of sugar for 
canning. 

Cranberries. — 338. 

To preserve cranberries, allow them their weight in 
sugar; make a syrup in the proportions of half a pint of 
water to two pounds of the sugar, boil and skim it 
before you put the fruit in, then let them boil and clear. 
To make sauce to eat with roast fowls, put three-fourths 
of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. 



CANDIES. 

Crystallized Popcorn.— 339. 

One cupful of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, three 
tablespoonfuls of water. Boil in a large kettle until 
thoroughly melted, stir in a large panful of popped corn, 
and stir until all is covered. Take off the stove, and stir 
until cold. 

Best White Molasses Candy.— 340. 

One pound of granulated sugar, one pint of good 
syrup, boil till quite thick when dropped into cold water. 
Then add one pint of best Porto Rico molasses, three or 
four tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Boil to the snap, remove 
from the fire and stir in quickly half a small tablespoon- 
ful of soda, and flavor with essence of lemon. Pour on 
the slab and work white. This makes a better candy 
than that which is usually sold by confectioners. Good 
candy can also be made with no sugar. 

Chocolate Caramels, — 341. 

Take six tablespoonfuls of molasses, put it in the 
kettle with six tablespoonfuls of extra C sugar, three 
tablespoonfuls of milk of butter and seven tablespoonfuls 
of grated chocolate. Boil all together fifteen minutes, 
then add three tablespoonfuls of butter and half a tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Boil until brittle. Pour into well- 
greased tins. Cut into squares when a little cool. 



— 134 — 

Marshmallows.— 342. 
Take halt a pound of gum arabic and put it to soak 
in one pint of cold water. When dissolved, strain into 
an agate saucepan, then set the saucepan in another one 
of hot water to boil, and add to the gum arabic two 
cupfuls and a half of powdered sugar, to boil until it 
thickens. Try a little of the mixture in cold water, if it 
forms a firm, but not hard ball, it is done. Then set the 
saucepan on the table and beat the mixture with an egg- 
beater fifteen minutes. Now slowly add the whites of 
three eggs beaten to a stiff froth, and beat them in 
thoroughly. Flavor with orange flower, and beat fifteen 
minutes longer. Pour the paste upon a pan covered 
with corn-starch. When cold and set, cut into squares 
or into long strips, and pack it in confectioners' sugar 
until used. To have success with marshmallows, they 
should be beaten at least one hour with an egg-beater or 
^^ egg-whip. Beat diligently ; then, when the gum has 
been beaten very white and light, add the whites of eggs 
beaten stiff, and beat the mixture a little longer. Marsh- 
mallows without eggs must be beaten in the same 
manner. 

Nougat Candy.— 343. 

A simple and satisfactory way to make nougat candy 
is to blanch a pound of almonds and cut lengthwise in 
thin slips ; lay them in front of the fire to dry, melt half 
a pound of loaf sugar, and when it becomes a rich brown 
lay in the almonds. Oil small moulds with almond oil, 
pour in the syrup, and with the handle of an oiled tea- 
spoon spread it so as to line the mould. When cold, 
turn out. 



— 135 — 

Walnut Oream Oandy. — 344. 
White of one egg, as much water as egg ; add a pinch 
of salt, a little vanilla and a little brandy. Stir (not beat) 
enough confectioners' sugar to form a cream, or until 
like dough. Crack English walnuts so as to get the 
halves out whole, press on each one of the halves, on 
each side, a little of the cream, so that the cream will 
meet at the edges. 

Oocoanut Balls.— 345. 

Any confectioner now will furnish his customers with 
freshly grated cocoanut at a reasonable price, which is a 
great saving of labor at home. To one pound and a half 
of white sugar put one pint of water, and boil until ropy ; 
then turn it out into the bowl, and stir into it one good- 
sized cocoanut, and when cool make into balls with the 
hand and set away to dry. 

Newport Oandy. — 346. 
One pint of molasses, half a pint of brown sugar, 
one-quarter pound of butter. Choose a cold winter day 
for your candy making, and you can hardly fail to be 
pleased with your success, for this recipe is generally 
liked. Boil for several hours until a drop cast into a 
cup of cold water will harden by the time it reaches the 
bottom. Have ready some buttered dishes, and pour a 
thin layer of the boiling candy over the surface. Let it 
cool without pulling. It is crisp and very good. 

Butter-scotch.— 347. 
Three tablespoonfuls of molasses, two of sugar, two of 
water, one of butter; add a pinch of soda before taking 
up. 



— 136 — 

Chocolate Drops. — 348. 
Two cupfuls of sugar, half a cupful of milk ; let it boil 
eight minutes ; take off and set it into a pan of cold 
water ; make into balls. Steam half a cake of choco- 
late over hot water and roll the balls in the chocolate. 
Add a little vanilla. 

Soft Oream Taffy.— 349. 
Three pounds of granulated sugar, enough water to 
dissolve, a tablespoonful of vinegar. Cover closely and 
boil till it will make a ball in the fingers when tried 
in water. Remove from the fire, keep it covered and 
stand it in a cool place for twenty-four hours. Then 
place it near the fire just long enough to get it from the 
kettle. Pull with a little confectioners' sugar on the 
hands. When very white, roll in confectioners' sugar 
and cut into squares. Do not let the squares touch, 
and keep in a cool place. This is easy to make in cold 
weather . 

Molasses Candy. — 350. 

One pint of New Orleans molasses, one pint of yellow 
sugar, half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar, two table- 
spoonfuls of water, butter the size of a walnut. Mix 
well the molasses, sugar, cream of tartar and water 
before placing on the fire. Wipe down the edges of the 
pan, cover closely, and cook over a moderate fire. When 
it begins to look thick and rich, test in cold water. If 
brittle when struck on the edge of the cup, add the 
butter and remove from the fire. Turn into buttered 
tins. Scrape what adheres to the pan into a saucer by 
itself, as it is apt to grain. When cool enough to handle, 
pull and cut as desired. 



— 137 — 

Peanut Oandy.— 351, 

Two quarts of peanuts roasted in their shells and then 
shelled and hulled ; two pounds of light brown sugar. 
Boil the sugar in a preserving kettle with enough water 
to wet it thoroughly and form a syrup. When the 
sugar begins to boil, throw in the white of an egg to 
clear it ; strain it, and try, by dropping a little of the 
sugar into cold water, if it is done enough. If it hardens 
and becomes brittle, it is sufficiently boiled and must be 
.taken from the fire. The blanched nuts must then be 
stirred thoroughly through the sugar. Then wet with a 
brush a marble slab free from all grease, and drop the 
hot mixture upon it. Flatten into small oblong blocks. 
When cold, take them off the board with a knife. 

Chocolate Caramels.— 352. 

Two pounds of New Orleans brown sugar, one-fourth 
pound of chocolate, one cup of rich cream, butter 
the size of an egg. Boil the sugar and milk and 
teat it hard (don't stir) all the time it is cook- 
ing. When it comes to a boil, then add the grated 
chocolate and let it boil five minutes, then take it off and 
add a tablespoonful of vanilla, beating it hard for five 
minutes. Pour it on buttered pans. Never stir it, but 
beat hard. 

Vassar College Molasses Candy.— 353. 

One cupful of molasses, two cupfuls of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. Mix and boil for ten minutes. 
When done add a lump of butter and a teaspoonful of 
vanilla or any other flavoring; to be pulled until light. 



-138- 

Nut Taflfy.— 354. 

Two pounds of sugar, half a pint of water; boil until it 
becomes brittle in cold water. Just before pouring it 
out, add a tablespoonful of good vinegar. Use any kind 
of nuts; put them in buttered pans and pour taffy- 
over them. Set in a cool place. 

Maple Sugar Caramels. — 355. 

Two pounds of maple sugar, one quart of rich milk. 
Break the maple sugar into small pieces and put into a 
pan on the fire with the milk; the pan must be deep 
enough to allow the sugar to expand as it boils. Stir 
without ceasing ; test as usual in cold water, and when it 
is sufficiently brittle it is done. Then pour into square 
buttered pans and score with a knife into small tablets. 

Oream Dates. — 356. 

Remove the seeds from choice dates and fill the open- 
ings with a smooth cream ; flavor according to taste. A 
nice variety. The soft part of figs, prunes and nicely 
preserved fruits, as peaches, apricots, cherries, oranges 
and pieces of pineapple may all be dried out in a little 
confectioners' sugar, then wrapped in pieces of smooth 
cream. All make choice confections. 

Chocolate Caramels. — 357. 

One cupful of molasses, one cupful of sweet milk, one 
cupful of brown sugar, one-fourth cake of chocolate, 
butter the size of a walnut. Stir while cooking ; and 
when, if dropped into water, it will form a stiff ball when 
taken in the fingers, remove, turn into buttered tins, and 
put into squares when cold. 



BEVERAGES. 

Eggnog.— 358. 

Whip the whites and yolks of six eggs into a stiff 
cream, adding half a cupful of sugar. Pour into a quart 
of rich milk, adding half a pint of good brandy, and a 
little flavoring of nutmeg. Stir up and thoroughly mix 
the ingredients, and add the whites of three additional 
eggs well whipped. 

Hop Beer.— 359. 

One handful of hops ; boil an hour and add one 
pint of molasses and enough water to make two 
gallons. When milk-warm, add one cup or cake of 
yeast ; let it stand overnight ; skim and pour it off from 
the yeast carefully; add one tablespoonful of winter- 
green, and bottle for use. 

Good Cooking Wine.— 360. 
One quart of grape juice (fox grapes, Catawbas, Con- 
cords, or the small wild grapes, gathered after frost, will 
answer), three quarts of water, two and a half pounds of 
common brown sugar. Let the juice of the grapes be 
strained clear, mix it with the water and sugar and put 
directly into an open barrel or cask (for the vessel 
should be full), and let it stand so in a cellar for nine 
days ; then cork up the cask tight, fasten the bung, and 
set aside till spring, when it may be bottled, and is ready 
for use.

Blackberry Oordial.— 363. 

Warm and squeeze the berries. To one pint of juice 
allow one pound of white sugar, half an ounce of ground 
cinnamon, one-fourth ounce of mace, two teaspoonfuls of

add for each pint a glass of French brandy. 

Ginger Beer. — 364, 

Boil gently, in a gallon of water, three tablespoonfuls 
of cream of tartar, three of ginger, and a lemon cut into 
slices. When it has boiled half an hour, take it from the 
fire, strain and sweeten it to your taste — white sugar is 
the best, but brown sugar or molasses answers very 
well. Put to it, when lukewarm, half a pint of fresh 
yeast. Turn it off carefully. When fermented, bottle it, 
and keep it in a cool place. It will be fit to drink in the 
course of seven or eight days. 



— 141 — 

Grape Wine.— 365. 

Bruise the grapes, which should be perfectly ripe. To 
each gallon of grapes put a gallon of water, and let the 
whole remain a week, without being stirred. At the end 
of that time, draw off the liquor carefully, and put to 
each gallon three pounds of lump sugar. Let it ferment 
in a temperate situation — when fermented, stop it up 
tight. In the course of six months, it will be fit to 
bottle. 

Grape Wine.— 366. 

Strip the grapes from their stalks, leaving out all 
decayed ones. Put them into a bowl or wooden tub, 
and with a wooden beetle mash them thoroughly. 
Cover with a cotton or linen cloth and let stand for sev- 
eral days in a moderately cool place until fermentation 
has well begun. Strain and measure, and to each gallon 
add one pound of granulated sugar. When the sugar is 
thoroughly dissolved, put into a cask (the vessel, whatever 
its size, should be full); let stand uncovered for twenty- 
four hours, then bung up and cover the bung with clay 
or paraffine to keep out the air. Let stand for six 
months ; then draw off and bottle. 

Ginger Pop.— 367. 

Two pounds of brown sugar, one large tablespoonful 
of the fibrous part of ginger, half a lemon sliced, one 
dessertspoonful of cream of tartar. Pour on it two

at night, It will be ready for use in three days. 



— 142 — 

strawberry Acid. — 368. 

Dissolve four ounces of citric acid in one-half gallon 
of water, and pour it over two gallons of ripe stawberries. 
Let stand twenty-four hours, and then drain. To every 
pint of juice add a pound of sugar. Let it boil well for 
five minutes ; then let it stand three days before bottling. 
When ready to serve, add two tablespoonfuls to a glass 
of ice-water. 

Mulled Cider.— 369. 

This is excellent, and to be good must be served as 
it is prepared. Put one quart of cider on to boil, add to 
it twenty whole cloves. When it comes to a boil, let it 
boil three minutes, then add white sugar to make it 
rather sweet. Beat six eggs, whites and yolks together, 
until very light. Pour the boiling cider upon the eggs, 
beating rapidly all the while; then pour the mixture 
backward and forward, from one pitcher to another, 
until frothy and well mixed. Pour into glasses, grate a 
little nutmeg on top of each glass and serve right away. 

Cafe' au Lait.— 370. 

This is delicious for either the after-dinner or luncheon 
beverage. Make one quart of strong, clear coffee of 
Mocha and Java mixed, add one quart of boiling milk. 
These must be added together in the hot coffee-pot and 
covered immediately. Have in the cream pitcher, ready 
to serve with the coffee, the whites of three eggs, beaten 
very stiff. Then put a tablespoonful of the beaten whites 
into each cup when served, stirring it to a foamy billow in 
the center. Let each one add cut sugar to taste.

paste, two bitter almonds blanched and pounded to 
paste, two lumps of loaf sugar, one pint of water. Mix 
one gill of boiling water with the almonds when you 
have pounded them in a mortar ; strain, return to the 
mortar and pound with more water until you have used 
a pint in all ; sweeten to taste. A delicious beverage, 
but it does not keep long. 

Oodfee with Egg.— 373. 

One egg is sufficient to clear one cupful of ground 
coffee. If a smaller quantity be desired half an egg 
may be used, as if fresh, the remainder will keep till the 
next day. Or, the whole egg may be beaten with the 
ground coffee and such portion of it used as is needed, 
keeping the remainder closely covered. To make the 
coffee, add half a cupful of cold water to the portion of 
egg to be used and one-third of a cupful of coffee. 
Beat well, put it into the hot coffee-pot, add one pint of 
boiling water and boil five minutes. Keep it hot, but 
not boiling, for ten minutes. Pour out a little and pour 
it back to clear the spout.

little cold water. Do not make starch of it. Be 
sure your milk is scalding hot when you add your 
thickening, which pour into the middle of the milk, 
stirring it gently till all is thickened. After simmering 
till there is no raw taste of the flour, add a little butter 
and stir it through the milk. Have your toast ready. 
Lay a few slices on a deep dish, pour over them some 
of the hot cream, then lay on a few more slices and pour

pan ; add a tablespoonful of milk and one of broth or 
gravy, pepper and salt; break in two eggs and stir 
quickly until they begin to thicken, then put the stewpan 
on the table, and continue stirring until the eggs finish 
cooking in their own heat. Scrambled eggs should 
look lumpy and be very thick. When done, pour the 
eggs onto buttered toast. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. — 389. 
Cut cold boiled potatoes into dice. When in the stew- 
pan, add cream to keep them moist, and simmer till hot 
They should be of a light color. When hot, mix in a 
little chopped parsley and butter. Serve immediately 
while hot. 

Pried Potatoes.— 390. 
Pare the potatoes raw, and cut them lengthwise into 
slices ; cut these again into thin strips ; lay in ice-water 
for half an hour; drain, dry thoroughly, and drop into 
boiling lard ; when brown, put them into a colander and 
set it in a hot oven to drain ; serve hot. 

Potato Balls— Duchesses.— 391. 
Take one-half dozen potatoes ; boil them ; pass them 
through a sieve, and work into them, in a bowl, one gill 
of cream and the yolks of three eggs ; add pepper, salt, a 
grating of nutmeg, and some parsley finely grated ; when 
they are well mixed and smooth, mould them into perfectly 
round balls, flour them, and fry them in hot lard or 
butter, rolhng them continually so that they may be 
evenly browned ; drain, and serve on a folded napkin. 



— 149 — 

Tomato Omelet.— 392. 

Pour boiling water on the tomatoes; skin, and cut them 
fine. To one quart of this, put two chopped onions and 
a lump of butter the size of an egg; let them boil half an 
hour; then mash them. Put in the grated bread, pepper, 
salt and the yolks of two eggs. 

Egg Omelet.— 393. 
Soak a teacupful of bread crumbs overnight in a cup- 
ful of new milk. Beat separately the yolks and whites 
of three eggs. Mix the yolks with the bread and milk, 
stir in the whites, and salt and make as usual. 

Oyster Omelet.— 394. 
Three eggs, eighteen oysters, lemon juice, two ounces 
of butter, cayenne pepper, salt. Beat the eggs very 
lightly. Beard the oysters; stir them into the beaten 
eggs, and season highly with cayenne, salt and lemon 
juice. Melt the butter in a clean omelet pan, skim away 
all froth, and pour in the egg mixture before the butter 
becomes colored. Hold the handle, and keep the pan 
moving over the fire until the omelet mixture looks of 
the consistency of thick cream ; let the pan rest over the 
fire for about a minute. Swiftly slide a broad, pliable 
knife or a slice under one half, and fold it over the other 
half to form an oval. Trim the edges neatly, and tilt the 
pan, so that the lower side of the omelet may become of 
a golden-brown color ; it will then be ready. Reverse 
the pan over a hot dish, and serve quickly with the 
brown side uppermost. The omelet should be brown 
and firm on the outside, but soft and creamy inside when 
broken. Never turn an omelet, as this makes it heavy. 



— ISO- 
Savory Omelet. — 395. 

Break four eggs into a basin, add to them a little 
pepper and salt, a dessertspoonful of finely chopped 
parsley, a tiny piece of onion scalded and finely chopped; 
beat them all well together. Melt half an ounce of 
butter in an omelet pan ; pour the mixture into it. Move 
the pan round until the eggs are set ; fold it over in half; 
turn it onto a hot dish and serve immediately. 

Egg Baskets.— 396. 

Make these for breakfast the day after you have had 
roast chicken, duck or turkey for dinner. Boil six eggs 
hard, cut nearly into halves and extract the yolks ; rub 
these to a paste with some melted butter, pepper and salt, 
and set aside. Pound the minced meat of the cold fowl fine 
in the same manner and mix with the egg paste, moist- 
ening with melted butter as you proceed, or with a little 
gravy if you have it to spare. Cut off a slice from the 
hollowed whites of the eggs to make them stand ; fill in 
with the paste ; arrange close together upon a flat dish, 
and pour over them the gravy left from yesterday's 
roast, heated boiling hot and mellowed by a few spoon- 
fuls of cream or rich milk. 

Eggs and Bacon.— 397. 

Time, three to four minutes. Six eggs, a quarter of a 
pound of dripping or butter, some slices of ham or 
bacon. Break five or six fresh eggs into cups, and slip 
them into a delicately clean frying-pan of boiling drip- 
ping or butter. When the whites are set, take them up 
with a slice, trim off the rough edges and drain them 



— iSi — 

from the grease. Then place them in the center of the 
dish, and the slices of fried bacon round the edge, or 
the eggs may be served on the bacon, whichever you 
prefer. 

Breakfast Kidney and Eggs.— 398. 
Prepare four lamb kidneys by scalding and skinning. 
Put into the chafing-dish a walnut of butter and half a 
teaspoonful of chopped onions. When browned, add a 
tablespoonful of water, and then drop into the dish four 
raw eggs. As soon as these set, serve the dish. 

Oyster en Surprise. — 399. 
Cut a small slice from each end of four hardboiled 
eggs, and cut them into halves the round way. Take 
out the yolks and pound them in a mortar, and pound 
in with them a mixture made of a dozen bearded 
oysters, a little lemon juice, a dust of cayenne, and half 
an ounce of butter. Be sure to mix and pound thor- 
oughly. Fill the whites of eggs with this mixture, dish 
them up, garnish with cut lemon and rolled brown bread 
and butter. 

Grilled Mackerel.— 400. 

Split the mackerel down the back, season with pepper 
and salt, oil it over, place it on a gridiron over a mod- 
erate fire, and when done on both sides take it up on a 
hot dish and fill the inside with cold maitre d ' kotel sa.uce. 

Grilled Smoked Haddock.— 401. 
One haddock, a little milk, one teaspoonful of butter, 
a little cayenne. Wash, dry and skin the haddock. It 
may be cut into square pieces or left whole. Put a little 



— 152 — 

milk on a plate ; let it soak in this for an hour or two. 
Take the pieces up, and either grill them or toast them 
for a few minutes ; put the butter over them in little bits, 
and the pepper ; serve hot. They may be served on 
toast. 

Broiled Salted Oodflsh.— 402. 

Cut from the medium-sized salt codfish three pieces 
about two inches square ; split each piece into two, and 
soak in water overnight ; change the water two or three 
times. Next morning rinse the pieces in fresh, cold 
water, and drain and dry in a napkin; brush a little 
butter over each, and broil. When done, pour over them 
melted butter seasoned with pepper and lemon juice. 

Mutton Outlets.— 403. 

It is often convenient to dress loin chops as a break- 
fast dish for one or two persons as follows : Trim away the 
fat, cut the meat neatly from the bones, and divide each 
chop into two. Egg and bread-crumb them, and fry in 
a little butter. Take the bones with an onion and make 
them into gravy. Thicken this either with a cooked 
potato rubbed through the sieve, a little tomato sauce, 
or flour, or serve plain. 

Stuffed Kidneys.— 404. 

Three or four kidneys, one-half ounce of butter, one- 
half shallot chopped fine, one dessertspoonful of parsley, 
one tablespoonful of bread crumbs, a few drops of lemon 
juice, a little cayenne, pepper and salt. Toast or broil 
the kidneys and split them open. Fry the shallot in the 



— IS3 — 

butter ; mix in the bread crumbs and parsley ; add lemon 
juice, cayenne, pepper and salt. Lay a little of the 
stuffing in each kidney and fold it over. Serve very hot. 

Pried Salt Pork.— 405. 

Cut into slices, and lay them in cold water in the 
spider ; boil them up two or three minutes, then pour 
off the water and set the spider again on the coals and 
brown the slices on each side. Fried pork with baked 
potatoes and fried sour apples makes a very good dinner. 
It is an inprovement to dip the pork, after being parboiled, 
into Indian meal before frying it. 

Fried Calf's Liver.— 406. 

Cut the liver into thin slices ; wash and drain them ; 
then dip them in cracker crumbs (or stale bread), and 
fry with salt pork gravy or butter ; add a little cayenne 
pepper. 

Fried Sausages. — 407. 

One pound of sausages, one-half tablespoonful flour, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper, one and one-half gills of cold water. Prick the 
sausages well with a fork, place them in a cold frying- 
pan, place the pan over a slow fire, and turn the sausages 
frequently for fifteen minutes. Place the sausages on a 
hot dish, and add to the dripping which has drawn from 
the sausages in the frying-pan the flour, pepper, and salt. 
Stir all well together, and add the cold water; stir till 
boiling, let it boil for two minutes, and pour it over the 
sausages. If desired, a piece of diy toast may be served 
under each sausage. 



— 154 — 

Beef Croquettes.— 408. 

You can make these of the cold hash by moulding it 
into rolls about three and one-half inches long, and 
rather more than an inch in diameter. Roll these over 
and over on a flavored dish or board to get them smooth 
and of regular shape ; flatten the ends by setting each up- 
right on the floury dish, and put enough dripping in the 
pan to cover them as they lie on their sides in it. It 
should be very hot before they go in. Roll over carefully 
in the fat as they brown, not to spoil the shape. Do not 
put too many into the pan at once. As fast as they are 
done take them up and lay in a hot colander until they 
are ready. Arrange neatly on a heated flat dish and 
serve. 

Corned Beef Hash.— 409. 

Chop rather fine some cold corned beef. To each pint 
add one and one-half pints of cold boiled potatoes 
chopped fine, one tablespoonful of butter, and one cupful 
of stock, or, if no stock is on hand, two-thirds cupful of 
hot water. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Put 
the mixture into a frying pan, and stir over the fire for 
about eight minutes, being careful not to burn it. Spread 
smoothly. Cover the pan and set it back where the hash 
will brown slowly. It will take about half an hour. 
When done, fold in like an omelet, and turn onto a 
hot dish. Garnish with points of toast and parsley. 
Serve hot. If there are no cold potatoes, the same 
quantity of hot mashed potatoes may be used. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 

Welsh Rarebit.— 410. 

Some slices of bread about half an inch in thickness ; 
some slices of cheese, a little butter, the yolk of an egg, 
pepper and salt, a little cayenne. Toast the bread and 
keep it quite hot. Cut the cheese into very thin slices. 
Put it into a saucepan with the butter, pepper and salt to 
taste. Stir until it has melted, then mix in the yolk. 
Spread it on the toast, and brown before the fire. 

Fried Apples.— 411. 

Choose very firm, sound, sour apples ; wash and wipe 
them, cut them in quarters, and take out the cores ; put 
the frying-pan over the fire with half an inch of fat in it, 
and when the fat is smoking hot, put in the apples and 
fry them brown, turning them carefully to prevent 
breaking. Just before they are quite brown, dust them 
with sugar ; when they are done, take them up without 
breaking, and serve them hot as a vegetable. 

Fritters.— 412. 

Two well beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of melted 
lard, two-thirds cupful of sweet milk, one heaping tea- 
spoonful of baking-powder, a little salt, and flour enough 
to make a stiff batter. Drop from a spoon into hot 
lard ; turn two or three times while cooking to prevent 
too much browning. To be eaten with maple syrup. 



-iS6- 

Banana Fritters. — 413. 

Remove the skin from four large yellow bananas. 
Cut the fruit in two crosswise, then lengthwise, in not 
too thin slices ; dip them into a batter, fry in hot fat, and 
serve with a sweet sauce, flavored with kirsch or other 
liquor. Make the batter as follows : Beat the yolks of 
three eggs and add a gill of milk, a saltspoonful of salt, 
four ounces of sifted flour, and mix thoroughly. 

Apple Fritters.— 414. 

Make a smooth batter of half a pound of flour, three 
eggs and half a pint of sweet milk ; salt to taste. Cut a 
dozen large, juicy apples into slices, after peeling and 
coring them. Throw the slices into the batter. Have 
ready a pan of equal parts of lard and butter boiling hot. 
Take the batter up in a ladle, allowing a slice of apple 
to each fritter and drop into the hot lard. Fry brown, 
drain a moment, and serve with powdered sugar and 
nutmeg. 

Huckleberry Shortcake.— 415. 

One quart of sifted flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of soda, one large pint of berries, half a 
cupful of creamed butter, half a cupful or more of sugar, 
two eggs, two cupfuls of sour milk. Sift soda and salt 
with flour. Mix berries with the flour, coating every 
berry so as to be separate. Beat the eggs and mix with 
the butter and sugar. Make a hollow in the middle of 
the flour and pour in the mixture, then the sour milk. 
Stir all carefully together, else you will mash the 
berries. Bake in pans, three-quarters full. 



— 157 — 

Oranges.— 416. 
Of the many ways of serving oranges, I prefer them 
sliced. If in summer, keep them cold until wanted. 
Remove all seeds, and cut large slices in two. Man- 
darins are served whole, with the peel scored but not 
removed. 

Farina Jelly.— 417. 

Boil one quart of new milk ; while boiling, sprinkle in 
slowly a quarter of a pound of farina ; continue the boil- 
ing from half an hour to an hour, season with a teacup- 
ful of sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. When done, 
turn out into a mould and place it on the ice to stiffen. 
Serve it with whipped cream. 

Baked Apples.— 418. 
Peel one pound of apples, cut into slices, remove the 
cores, put into a stewpan with three or four ounces of 
white pounded sugar, one ounce of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of water ; stir gently on a slow fire till tender ; 
use hot or cold, as required. Brown sugar may be 
used. To the above add the juice of half a lemon or of 
one orange, and a little of the peel of either, or a small 
piece of cinnamon, or in powder. 

Friar's Omelet.— 419. 
Pare, core, slice and stew one dozen apples ; stir in 
two ounces of butter, and the same of pounded sugar, or 
rather more sugar if the apples are acid; allow the 
apples to cool. Beat up four eggs, put them in a baking 
dish well lined with bread crumbs, put in the apples, 
strew bread crumbs over the top, and bake three- 
quarters of an hour in a rather quick oven. Turn out, 
sift sugar over the top, and serve with cream. 



-158- 

Rice Cakes.— 420. 

Mix two ounces of ground rice with six ounces of 
flour and one teaspoonful of baking-powder; rub in 
an ounce of fresh butter and two ounces of sugar. 
Beat up an egg into one-fourth pint of milk with a 
little lemon flavoring. Have ready small patty-pans 
rubbed with butter, half fill each with the cake mixture, 
put immediately into the oven, and bake for fiifteen 
minutes. 

Macaroons. — 421. 

Blanch and pound three ounces of sweet almonds with 
half a pound of fine powdered sugar ; beat up to a very 
light froth the whites of four eggs with an ounce of rice 
flour and a tablespoonful of dry sherry ; whisk it into 
the almond paste ; drop the mixture on paper in wafers 
about two inches apart, and bake in a moderate oven. 
Neatly arrayed around whipped cream, they are used 
quite frequently. 

Scotch Short Bread.— 422. 

Three-quarters pound of finest flour, one-half pound of 
butter, one-fourth pound of castor sugar. Put the flour 
and sugar into a basin and rub the butter thoroughly in ; 
turn it out on the board, and knead firmly till it is 
a smooth paste (it requires a great deal of strength to 
knead it), roll it out to the thickness of about an inch, 
and shape to suit. It should not be much rolled, as 
rolling makes it tough. Bake on a sheet in a brisk 
oven for from twenty minutes to half an hour.
