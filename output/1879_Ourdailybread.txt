PREFACE, 



We may live without poetry, music and art; 
We may live without conscience, and live without heart; 
We may live without friends, we may live without books ; 
But civilized man cannot live without cooks." 

People who know nothing of our ways say we starve. We say, know- 
ingly, that we are the only people who do not starve. Because we use 
such food as can be appropriated by the vital system, and hence the body 
is nourished and strengthened, for vital force is expended in tising^ not in 
resisting or expelling food material. 

The true office of cooking is to render food better, not worse. Keep- 
ing this in mind, we readily decide what good cooking really means. It 
is combining articles of food in such a way and subjecting them to such 
processes as will not detract from, but will rather add to their health and 
life sustaining qualities. 

There is in hygienic cooking a call for more skill, more nicety in 
adaptation of means, more thoughtful painstaking, than in the ordinary 
methods of preparing food, because, using little or nothing in the way of 
condiments, the flavor of food is dependent on the material itself, and the 
natural sweetness and flavor must be developed by proper cooking, not 
made by the additions of foreign ingredients. 

Hygienic food must not deprive us of esthetic any more than gusta- 
tory pleasure, in fact those delights can be, and are, not only secured but 
enhanced by rendering fo^d simple and wholesome. 

But I have seen this mistake made by good honest, earnest, self sacri- 
ficing people, who were laboring most ineffectually to induce in others a 
liking for great, coarse, ugly looking, insipid food. Bread made in huge 
gem pans, or cut in crooked thick slices from the loaf, or shaped in clumsy 



OUR DAILY BREAD. 



biscuits or thick door mats of pancakes — vegetables cooked too much or too 
little and served floating in their " watery grave," — fruits only half cooked, 
pies with thick, tough, unshapely looking crusts — puddings badly com- 
bined and worse served, — all very good material in the first place, but 
because of omitting to observe some simple common sense measures, all is 
spoiled and hygienic cooking is not acceptable, and no wonder. 

Bread, of whatever kind, to be good, must be well baked. Pancakes 
should be thin, small and light. Gems baked in small moulds — they are 
thus crisp and delicate. The biscuit cutter should be not over an inch and 
a half or two inches in diameter. Pies must be made with thin crust neatly 
trimmed and delicate at the edges. Puddings should be served in small 
dishes ; mushes, also, etc-,, etc., etc. 

Our daily bread is not so radical as we would have it, perhaps, 
but the dietetic world must be won rather than forced to natural states. 

Science and reason are consulted, it seems, not until grim dyspepsia 
takes hold and will not let go his clutch. 

And so, I believe this an opportune moment for hygienic cook books, 
and hygienic ways generally. For all sorts of chronic diseases prevail and 
persistently refuse to depart at the command of oi-dinary eating and drug 
taking, and at last we may hope that people will listen to " common 
sense," and be guided out of this quagmire of disease and death.

SOUPS. 

Soup can be made in such variety that but few general 
directions need be here given. We sometimes use " stock " 
made from boiling good fresh beef or mutton several hours, 
allowing the liquor to cool and skimming the fat from it. Again, 
vegetable soup may be very nice made without meat. Other 
soups also. 

ASPARAGUS SOUP. 

1. Boil fifteen or twenty stalks of asparagus in a little more 
than enough water to cover it; when done, take up with a skim- 
mer, and serve on toast, or cut up in small pieces and leave in 
the soup, to which add half a cup of sweet milk and thicken 
with flour or corn starch to the consistency of cream. Add salt 
to taste. 

BEAN SOUP. 

2. Soak the beans over night, boil them till soft, then run 
them through a colander. Put the liquor back in the pot and 
add half a pint of milk in which have been stirred two or three 
tablespoonfuls of white flour ; add salt to taste. Have ready in 
your soup tureen two or three slices of toast cut into small 
squares ; pour the soup over these and send to the table hot. 

CORN SOUP. 

3. Take of corn, cut from the cob, one quart ; boil in one 
quart of water for fifteen minutes, then add a pint of milk ; salt 
to taste. Thicken with flour or corn starch to the desired con- 
sistency. 



lO OUR DAILY BREAD. 



PEA SOUP. 

4. Pea soup may be made in the same way as asparagus 
soup. 

POTATO SOUP. 

5. Peel and cut into slices one quart of potatoes ; boil in 
two quarts of water ; when done mash fine ; add salt and two 
table spoonfuls of white flour, stirred in half a pint of rich milk. 
Pour over toast ; serve hot. 

MISS LOTTIE DUBACH'S TURNIP SOUP. 

6. Take three medium sized turnips, slice into small narrow 
strips, put on in a pot of two quarts of cold water, boil till ten- 
der ; then stir in a desert spoonful of flour with a little milk, and 
butter the size of an egg, add one pint of milk and salt to suit 
the taste; let it come to a boil, put in a cup full of crushed 
crackers just as you take it off, and you have a good mock oys- 
ter soup. 

Adding half a teacupful of picked up codfish to the above 
soup decides the flavor as oyster. 

CHICKEN OR BEEF SOUP. 

7. Take the broth in which you have boiled a chicken or a 
piece of fresh beef, add salt to taste, and half a teacupful of 
rice, or noodles. These are made by beating an egg, then 
working in flour till you have a very stiff dough; roll very 
thin, flour well, roll up and cut off in as narrow strips as you 
can, throwing the strips into flour to dry; let them boil in the 
soup for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 

8. One parsnip, one carrot, one turnip, one-eighth of a 
head of cabbage ; chop fine, put into three quarts of water, sim- 
mer for an hour and a half; then add three potatoes chopped 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 



fine, one pint of tomatoes, two large onions which must be first 
chopped fine and fried in a little butter for five or ten minutes. 
Frying the onions greatly improves the soup. Let the soup boil 
for half an hour longer, and five minutes before taking up add 
salt and a few sprigs of chopped parsley. You can leave out 
any vegetable you do not like or do not happen to have at hand. 

GREEN CORN SOUP 

9. Grate or scrape from the cob a pint of corn, to this add 
one pint of milk and one pint of water, a little salt and butter, 
boil gently for ten or fifteen minutes. If you like it better add 
one tablespoonful of fine flour; it gives more body to the soup. 

RACKABONE SOUP. 

10. Put all the bones, scraps of meat, and the dressing of a 
cold roast turkey or chicken into a kettle with enough water to 
cover them; let them boil for one or two hours, then skim out 
the bones and meat, chop the meat fine, return to the soup, add- 
ing a little salt ; let it boil up well together and serve. Or, if 
you like, strain all the meat and bones out, and serve clear, or 
with a little rice or barley boiled in it. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

11. To six good sized tomatoes add water to cover, boil 
one hour, then strain through a coarse sieve. Put back in the 
kettle and bring to a boil ; stir in one tablespoonful of fine flour 
mixed to a smooth batter with cold water, let it boil five min- 
utes. Season to suit the taste. 

MISS LOTTIE DUBACH'S PEA SOUP. 

12. Take about two pounds of beef, put on a slow fire in 
cold water and skim before it boils ; wash a pint of dried peas, put 
on the fire in cold water in a separate vessel. After they boil a 



OUR DAILY BREAD. 



few minutes skim out and put into the boiling soup. Steep till 
soft, one half pint of barley in cold water and pour into the soup; 
add one onion peeled and sliced fine, also one turnip or carrot, 
with salt to flavor. Boil the whole on a slow steady fire for 
three hours or more, being careful not to let it burn. 



FISH. 



We have been taught that fish is the lowest form of animal 

food, but as it is a favorite dish with many we will give the 

simplest methods of preparing it for the table — methods that we 

have tried and proved to our own satisfaction as well as that 

^ of all who partook thereof. 

BAKED FISH. 

1. After scaling, cleaning and washing, salt the fish, roll in 
corn meal, put in a baking pan with a little water and bake half 
or three quarters of an hour in a hot oven, basting as you would 
a fowl. You will be surprised that it can taste so nice with so 
simple cooking. Good either hot or cold. 

BOILED FISH. 

2. Wrap your fish in a cloth, which you may either sew or 
pin on, and put into boiling water, which must be salted ; sim- 
mer gently an hour, more or less, according to the size of the fish, 
or until the fish will leave the bone easily ; have ready a dressing 
made of milk, with' salt to taste, a little parsley chopped fine, 
and thickened with white flour to the consistency of drawn but- 
ter sauce. Take the fish from the cloth, remove the skin, put it 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 



whole on a platter and pour the dressing over. Serve hot. If 
any should be left over, either of this or baked fish, you will 
find it nice to use in n:iaking a dish which we call 

ESCALLOPED FISH. 

3. Carefully remove all the bones from the cold fish ; have 
about the same quantity of bread crumbs as fish ; chop fine one 
or two onions and some parsley, mix these with the bread crumbs 
with salt to taste ; then in a pudding dish put a layer of bread 
crumbs, then a layer of fish, until the dish is full, letting a layer 
of bread crumbs come last. Take butter the size of a hickory 
nut, cut in small pieces and put over the top, pour over the 
whole milk, or half milk and half water, till it rises to the top. 
It is better to let it stand an hour or two before baking. Bake 
in a quick oven for half an hour, or until nicely browned. 

FRIED FISH. 

4. Cut your fish into pieces the size of your hand, salt each 
piece and roll in corn meal, have just enough grease on 
the griddle to prevent stickirrg, and when the fish is brown on 
one side turn it, and keep turning till thoroughly done. Serve 
hot. 

STEWED CODFISH. 

5 Cut off a piece of codfish the size you wish to cook, 
soak over night ; in the morning turn off the water, add more 
cold water and bring to a boil, then turn off the water again. 
Mash or pick apart the fish, taking out the bones; add milk and 
thicken with white flour. This makes a nice breakfast dish 
with hot corn meal mush or baked potatoes. 

CODFISH AND POTATOES. 

6. Peel and boil a . dozen good sized potatoes ; soak in 
warm water a piece of codfish as large as your two hands, for 



OUR DAILY BREAD. 



three or four hours, letting it come to a boil at the last; then take 
out of the water, remove the bones, and chop up or mash fine. 
When the potatoes are done pour off the water, mash, add the 
codfish, a small piece of butter and half a pint of sweet milk ; 
stir all well together, put on a plate or dish, make the top 
smooth, put in the oven and brown. Serve hot. 

CODFISH BALLS. 

7. Prepare the same as for codfish and potatoes ; when cool 
enough mould with the hand into round cakes half an inch 
thick ; fry a delicate brown on both sides on slightly buttered 
griddles. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

8. Take good fresh fish, such kind as has few bones ; cut, 
after it is nicely cleaned, into pieces an inch or two square ; put 
in the bottom of a dinner pot some pieces of fat beef; let this 
fry a few moments, when put in a layer of thinly sliced potatoes, 
a layer of fish and a layer of bread grumbs ; repeat these layers 
until you have as much chowder as you wish to make. Season 
with salt and sliced onions. Pour over this a pint or more of 
hot water and as much rich milk as will cover the whole; a 
small piece of butter may be added. We usually fry the onions 
first with the fat beef. Cover the pot tight and let the chowder 
cook slow half an hour or more, till well done. Serve hot.

MEAT. 

BUYING AND COOKING. 

Beef and mutton are considered the best animal food. 
Never buy meat of any kind when the fat looks yellow. It is 
a sure sign of a diseased liver, hence is unwholesome. The 
lean part of an ox beef is bright red ; cow beef, pale red ; bull 
beef, dark red. 

In regard to the practice of pounding steak : Tender beef 
steak will not need pounding before broiling or frying. If it is 
tough, stew it, for in no other way will it be palatable. 

Skinning mutton takes from it its strong taste. 

BROILED BEEF STEAK. 

1. The best way to cook steak is to broil it. Wash and 
dry on a clean cloth your steak, then, having your broiler hot, 
put on the steak, turn it two or three times a minute to keep the 
juice from wasting; when done remove to a platter, add a little 
salt and butter. Serve immediately. 

FRIED STEAK. 

2. Have your skillet hot; put your steak in whole, or cut 
in pieces the size of the palm of your hand ; sprinkle on a little 
salt. When done brown on one side, turn and let it brown on 
the other side; then take it up on a platter, pour a cup of boiling 
water into the skillet, add a little salt and butter, thicken the 
gravy and turn over the meat ; if not ready to have it served at 
once, keep in a warm place. 

BAKED STEAK. 

3. Take a round stea.k ; make a stuffing of Graham bread 
crumbs, with an onion chopped fine, a little salt and sage ; wet 



1 6 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



up with milk, spread on the steak, then roll up Hke a roll jelly- 
cake; skewer or sew it together, put in a baking pan with a 
little water, sprinkle the steak with salt, bake an hour, basting 
as you would a fowl. This is very nice sliced up cold. 

STEWED BEEF STEAK. 

4. Cut in small pieces, put in a stew pan with just water 
enough to cover; add salt to taste ; when cooked tender make 
a crust of biscuit dough and put over the top of the meat; cover 
tight and let it cook for twenty minutes longer, then turn all 
out on a platter. This is an excellent way to cook a tough 
steak. 

POT ROAST. 

5. Take any nice roast, put it in your pot with a little boil- 
ing water, when nearly done add salt ; boil the water all down 
so that the juices of the meat may all be re-absorbed; let it brown 
a little but not burn. Good either hot or for cold sliced meat. 

MEAT PIE. 

6. Take any scraps of cold meat and boil till tender ; take 
out of the liquor and chop fine, then put back again with half a 
dozen potatoes and three or four sliced onions ; cook till all are 
done, having a good deal of liquor ; salt to taste. Have ready 
a deep dish lined on the sides with a good biscuit dough crust • 
pour into this your mixture, cover with a top crust half an inch 
thick, bake till the crust is done. Easily made and very nice. 

MEAT STEW. 

7. Same as the above, only instead of putting it in a pie 
put dumplings of biscuit dough in the pot and boil till done, 
turning all out on a platter. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 1 7 



LAMB OR MUTTON AND PEASE STEW. 

8. Cut your meat in smair pieces, boil till almost done, 
then add your peas and boil half an hour longer ; add a little 
parsley if you like it, and thicken with white flour stirred up in 
a little milk. Salt to taste. 

MUTTON CHOPS. 

9. Mutton takes a long time to cook, say two or three hours. 
Put your chops in a skillet with water to cover ; when the water 
has all evaporated and the chops are tender, let them brown on 
both sides, then turn on a pint of boiling water. Let all boil up, 
thicken and salt the gravy, and turn all together on a plate. 

IRISH STEW. 

10. Take lean mutton, potatoes and onions; first put in a 
deep kettle a layer of potatoes cut in slices, then a layer of 
onions, then mutton; then another layer of potatoes, onions and 
mutton, and finish with a layer of potatoes on top. Between 
each layer sprinkle salt and a little flour ; then put in enough 
water to prevent burning and cook slowly for four hours without 
•stirring. Cooked on the top of the stove with a hot fire it will 
not burn. 

BAKED MEAT. 

11. In a pudding dish put a thick layer of stale bread 
crumbs, on this a layer of cold boiled beef chopped fine and 
seasoned with salt, a little sage or parsley ; then another layer 
of bread crumbs ; moisten the whole with beef broth or water, 
and bake half an hour in a moderate oven. 

MEAT AND POTATO PIE. 

12. Line a shallow buttered pudding dish with finely 
mashed potato, seasoned to the taste ; fill to within an inch of 



l8 * OUR DAILY BREAD. 



the top with finely chopped cold beef, seasoned with salt and a 
little chopped onion moistened with beef gravy ; cover with the 
mashed potato and bake half an hour. 

BAKED MUTTON CHOPS. 

13. Place your chops in a baking pan and sprinkle salt 
over ; add a little water, cover with another pan and bake 
slowly for two hours, or until done ; take up the chops, make a 
gravy by adding a litde water, and thicken with a spoonful of 
flour mixed with milk, and pour over the chops. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

14. An old hen will answer very well for this. Cut up and 
soak over night in slightly salted water : in the morning put on 
cooking as early as possible in cold water ; watch it and when it 
comes to a boil skim it and let it simmer all the morning ; you 
can hardly cook it too much ; do not salt till nearly done. When 
done, take up the chicken on a platter,, add a pint of milk to 
the broth, and thicken with white flour stirred up with milk ; 
pour the gravy over the chicken and garnish the dish with 
parsley. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

15. Cut up a chicken and boil it until the flesh leaves the 
bones ; remove all the bones, picking the meat well apart, and 
boil down the broth to a consistency that will form jelly when 
cold, or if you like it not so rich boil less and use a little corn 
starch to thicken. Then add the meat and season with salt ; 
boil up once, pour into a mould and put a weight on it. When 
cold cut off in slices. 

PRESSED BEEF. 

16. Take a shank bone and boil till you can remove the 
bones ; chop the meat pretty fine and put back in the liquor 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 1 9 



with salt and a little sage ; boil till it will become jellied when 
cold and then mould. Cut in slices when cold. 



BAKED TURKEY. 

17. We will suppose you buy your turkey ready^dressed. 
Examine it carefully to be sure everything is removed that should 
be ; wash well with salt and water and then prepare your dress- 
ing by taking one or two quarts of brown bread crumbs seasoned 
to taste with salt and powdered sage and moisten with boiling 
milk just enough to hold together well ; then cut lengthwise a 
slit in the craw of the turkey, fill with dressing and sew up with 
long stitches ; put the rest of the dressing inside, no matter if it 
is not full, and then sew up the cavity ; next cut the neck off 
short and draw the skin over it and tie with a cord ; tie the 
wings and legs firmly in place, and it is then ready for the oven. 
Put it in a large dripping pan, rub it over with salt and put a 
cup of water in the pan. Bake from two to three hours, accord- 
ing to age or size, allowing lo or 15 minutes for each pound, 
basting every ten or fifteen minutes. When done take up on a 
platter, cut off the strings and pull out the stitches. For gravy, 
pour off the grease from the pan and add a pint or more of boil- 
ing water, a little butter, and thicken with white flour mixed 
with cold water. 

ESCALLOPED TURKEY. 

18. Take all the cold bits and dressing left from a baked tur- 
key and chop fine ; take twice the quantity of bread crumbs, add 
to these salt and chopped parsley, and onions, if you like them ; 
mix well ; then in a baking dish put first a layer of the crumbs, 
then a layer of turkey, and so on till your dish is full. Add any 
gravy left over and pour cold water over the whole, and let it 
stand half an hour, then" bake till nicely browned. 



20 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



OLD-FASHIONED CHICKEN POT PIE. 

19. Make a crust of light bread dough, shortened with butter^ 
as for raised biscuits. A good fat tender hen is the choice for 
a pot pie. Cut it in pieces as for fricasseed chicken and stew- 
in water enough to cover it until nearly done ; a few sliced po- 
tatoes nij^y be added. Then line the sides of a smooth round- 
bottomed kettle with the light crust, first buttering the sides of 
the kettle ; just at the bottom put no crust ; pour into this the 
stewed chicken, seasoned with salt and a small piece of butter ; 
have an abundance of gravy ; cut small inch square pieces of the 
dough and drop in the stew, then cover with crust rolled about 
as thick as for biscuit ; cover tight and on top of this lay a dry 
clean cotton cloth several folds in thickness and then put on 
your lid. It will take from half to three quarters of an hour for 
this to cook over a gentle fire. Serve immediately after remov- 
ing the cover and your pot pie will be a success — light and 
toothsome. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

20. Prepare tender young chickens as for stew or fricassee. 
Put them in a skillet and cover with water ; season with salt and 
very little butter. Let the skillet be covered tight and stand 
on the back of the stove, or where the chicken will simmer, not 
cook rapidly, for an hour or so, or until it is tender. Just before 
it is time to remove, take off the lid, place the skillet over the 
fire and let the water simmer down entirely; then sprinkle from 
the dredging box a little flour over the chicken and let it be 
turned and browned on both sides of each piece. It is much 
better cooked thus than when fried in lard or any consid- 
erable amount of grease. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 



VEGETABLES. 



A few p;eneral rules apply to the cooking of vegetables. 
Unless the water in which they are cooked is to be used as part 
of the dressing, it should be wholly evaporated, not allowed to 
be poured off, thus losing to the vegetable a great portion of its 
sweetness and richness. Thus cooked, there is no demand for 
for rich seasoning. 

ASPARAGUS. 

1. Put into, boiling water and boil till tender ; have ready 
in a dish or small platter some slices ot dry toast and lay the 
asparagus on the toast ; add a little butter to the water in which 
it was boiled and then pour over the toast. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

2. Cut the asparagus into small pieces and boil till tender ; 
then stir in a batter made of one tablespoonful of flour and half 
a cup of milk ; pour over toast or not, as you like. 

BEETS. 

3. Boil three or four large beets until tender ; put into cold 
water that the skin may be rubbed off; slice up in a dish, add a 
little salt and butter, and serve hot. 

YOUNG BEETS. 

4. Young beets with the tops cooked until tender, an hour 
or more, make a nice dish eaten with a little vinegar or lemon 
juice. 



22 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



BEET STEW. 

5. Cut in thick slices nice red beets and boil till nearly 
done, then add about the same quantity of sliced potatoes ; 
when done season with a little salt and milk after the water is 
nearly or quite evaporated. Serve hot. 

BAKED BEETS. 

6. Place nicely washed beets in a deep dish or porcelain 
pan, cover with water, and place in the oven to bake till tender. 
They are unusually sweet cooked in this way. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS. 

7. Boil in just enough water to cover them, and a few min- 
utes before taking up add a little salt and a tablespoonful of flour 
stirred up with milk enough to make a thin batter. 

DRY LIMA BEANS. 

8. These may be prepared the same way, only that it takes 
them longer to cook. 

STRING BEANS. 

9. Break or cut the pods in small pieces, first removing the 
strings ; then put in cold water enough to more than cover them 
and boil three or four hours. A little salt may be added and a 
small piece of butter, or a little cream, just before serving. 

BOILED WHITE BEANS. 

10. Wash and rinse in two warm waters and then cover 
with cold water three or four times their quantity, and boil 
slowly till done. Do not stir them, but be careful to serve well 
done, but unbroken. If more water is needed while cooking, 
add it boiling hot ; never pour cold water on them after they 
begin to boil. Salt very lightly. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 23 



BAKED BEANS, NO. i. 

11. To one pint of beans prepared as above, add three 
pints of cold water, a teaspoonful of sugar and half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. Bake in a stone jar or very deep dish, in a moder- 
ate oven, all day, and let them remain in the oven until after 
breakfast next morning. If while baking more water is required, 
add it hot. 

BAKED BEANS, NO. 2. 

12. Prepare the beans as for boiling and cook until partly 
done, then put into an earthen or porcelain dish, add a little 
salt and sugar, and, if you prefer, a piece of beefsteak the size of 
your hand , bake to a nice brown. We prefer this dish without 
the meat. 

BOILED CABBAGE 

13. Cut a cabbage into quarters and put into boiling water 
enough to cover it; let it cook for two or more hours, letting 
the water all evaporate, so as to retain the juices; add a little 
salt at table or pour over it a milk dressing. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

14. Remove all the green leaves, cut in half or cook whole 
the same as cabbage, until tender, then take up in a dish and 
pour over it a dressing of milk thickened with flour and slightly 
salted. 

GREEN CORN. 

15. Have your water boiling and drop your ears of corn in; 
boil from ten to fifteen minutes; too much boiling injures it. 
Eat without salt or butter if you would simplify your taste and 
get the full delicious flavor of the corn. 



24 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



STEWED CORN. 

1 6. In cutting corn from the cob, split the kernels length- 
wise with a sharp knife and then scrape the cob ; this is even 
better than grating the corn, as the fineness of the inside kernel 
is thus obtained with less of the outside coating. Or, with a 
sharp knife cut the very outside of the grains and then scrape. 
Stewed corn may be cooked in just enough water to cover it; 
cook ten minutes, add a very little salt and butter as seasoning, 
or a little milk in which is stirred smoothly a spoonful of white 
flour as thickening. 

BAKED CORN. 

17. Put the cut or scraped corn in a pudding dish and 
cover it with sweet milk; salt to taste and bake half an hour. 

GREEN CORN OMELET. 

18. Grate or scrape the corn from the cob and to one quart 
of corn add two eggs, a half pint of sweet milk, two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of flour ; salt to taste and bake till browned over. 
Some add sugar to this and use as a dessert. 

CORN OSYTERS. 

19. Two cups of corn pulp, one egg, a little salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of sweet milk, about one spoonful of white flour or 
enough to make a stiff batter ; drop on a hot, well greased grid- 
dle and fry a delicate brown. 

CORN AND TOMATOES. 

20 A layer of sliced tomatoes, one of green corn pulp, and 
then a layer of bread crumbs ; pour over it half a teacupful of 
hot water, and a little salt ; have as many layers as you like ; 
bake till well done. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 25 



SUCCOTASH. 

21. Boil one quart of lima beans till tender and then add 
one quart of sweet corn cut from the cob, and boil ten or fifteen 
minutes longer; salt slightly. Some like more corn, some less. 
Proportion it to suit yourself. 

GREENS. 

22. Pick carefully and wash in three waters; use a large pan 
to wash them in ; shake well, a handful at a time, in the water 
and place them in another large pan ; then pour a quantity of 
fresh water over the greens and shake and rinse as before, always 
lifting them from the water, as they are left gritty by pouring 
the water off. Have your pot boiling and pack the greens in it, 
(as they fill a large space before wilted), and boil until done. 
The length of time required depends on the kind of greens ; 
some will become tender in an hour, others need two hours or 
more boiling. When done, drain them in a colander, pressing 
the water well out. Put on a large v/hite platter, cut in neat 
blocks, and dress, for esthetic rather than gustatory effect, with 
dehcate slices of hard boiled eggs — about two eggs to a large 
platter of greens. A little butter may be spread over the greens 
previous to putting on the eggs. Good cider vinegar or lemon 
juice may also be used. Salt to taste. 

BOILED ONIONS. 

23. Peel half a dozen large onions and put them in boiling 
water with salt to taste ; boil till tender and then simmer down 
so as to retain all the juices; they need no other seasoning, 
but are delicious. 

ONION TOAST. 

24.. Boil some small onions till tender with a Httle salt in 
the water. Have ready some slices of toast in a dish and when 



26 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



the onions are done take them up with a skimmer and put them 
on the toast ; thicken the water, which should be boiled away 
to about a pint, with a little corn starch or fine flour and pour 
over the onions and toast. 

STEWED ONIONS. 

25. Cut half a dozen onions into slices and cook in just 
enough water to cover them for half or three quarters of an hour ; 
when done add a little salt and two or three spoonfuls of sweet 
cream ; thicken a little if you like. 

PARSNIPS. 

26. Wash and scrape as many parsnips as you wish to cook. 
Put them in boiling water and boil for two or three hours or 
until tender ; add a little salt when they are nearly done, and 
let them boil down in the water they are cooked in, and brown 
a little ; serve in this way or with a dressing of milk thickened 
with flour poured over them. 

GREEN PEAS. 

27. Shell your peas just before cooking and put into boiling 
water just enough to cover them ; add salt when nearly done and 
let the water boil away, don't turn any off"; cook from fifteen 
minutes to half an hour, according to their age. Some prefer to 
add a little cream or milk thickening. 

DRY PEAS. 

28. Cook as you do boiled dry beans. 

NEW POTATOES. 

29. New potatoes and green peas boiled together make a 
nice dish. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 27 



POTATO STEW. 



30. After paring and slicing the potatoes boil them till 
partly dissolved in the water ; have just enough water to cover 
them ; salt and add dumplings, if you like, made of sour milk 
and soda, stirred quite stiff with Graham flour. 



BAKED TOMATOES. 

31. Slice up tomatoes in a pudding dish until the dish is full, 
sprinkling salt on each layer, and bake an hour. 

FRIED TOMATOES 

32. Cut off the ends of the tomato, then cut each tomato 
into, say, three slices. Fry in as little butter as possible, just 
to prevent sticking, and turn like pancakes ; sprinkle on a little 
salt while cooking and serve smoking hot. If you like it better 
you can pour over the tomatoes, while still on the griddle, milk 
with a little fine flour stired in, and let it boil up ; this forms a 
gravy which is nice with corn mush or pancakes. 

ESCALLOPED TOMATOES. 

33. Take one quart of canned tomatoes, one quart or a 
little more of Graham bread crumbs ; chop fine two or three 
onions and mix with the bread crumbs ; then put in a baking 
dish a layer of tomatoes and a layer of bread crumbs alternately, 
sprinkling a little salt on each layer ; pour over the whole water 
enough to moisten and bake half an hour in a quick oven. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

34. Boil and season your tomatoes and then add a little 
milk thickened with white flour. Or, use bread crumbs instead 
of the milk and flour ; or better still, cook them for a long time 
and use no thickening at all. 



28 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



TURNIPS. 

35. Boil them down in the water in which they are cooked ; 
then mash fine and add a little salt and a spoonful or two of 
sweet cream. 

VEGETABLE OYSTERS. 

36. Pare and cut in transverse slices and boil in a small 
quantity of water. When tender, add a little thickening made 
of milk or cream and flour. It may be poured over toasted 
bread. 

CARROTS. 

37. Scrape, slice and boil till tender, boiling them down 
till all the water evaporates, then add a little butter and let them 
brown slightly ; then pour over them half a pint of sweet milk 
with a tablespoonful of white flour stirred in, and let it boil for 
a minute ; serve hot. Some like parsnips cooked with the car- 
rots in this same style, only the carrots require longer cooking 
than the parsnips. 

POTATOES. 

38. The very best way to cook potatoes is this : Wash 
them thoroughly, having them of even size if possible, and drop 
in boiling water, not allowing the pot to stop boiling fast till a 
fork will pierce the potato with but slight resistance. Then 
pour ofl" the water and set the pot on the fire, removing the 
cover, allowing the steam to escape. Send to the table hot and 
without removing the skins. In boiling potatoes, a wire basket 
is an important adjunct ; place it and the potatoes right in the 
boiling water, and they can be as quickly removed from the 
kettle when done. 

Potatoes are liked simply pared and and boiled, and served 
as above. The parings should be very thin, as the choice part 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 2g 



of the tuber is that nearest the outer integument ; it is the richest 
in starch gravies. 

After placing the nicely boiled potatoes in the vegetable 
dish, a dressing of milk in which has been stirred a thin batter, 
making the whole of the consistency of cream, may be poured 
over them hot. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

39. Boil as above, nicely pared potatoes ; when done pour 
off what water is left in the pot (there should be very lit- 
tle), empty them from the basket into the pot, and place them 
on the fire, mashing them rapidly laMe hot\ then stir with an 
iron spoon, mash again, and continue to do this until the whole 
mass is even and creamy. Add a little salt. 

FORKED POTATOES. 

40. Pare and boil mealy potatoes in slightly salted water 
and when done turn off the water and let them dry out well ; 
then, still keeping them in the kettle on the stove, beat with a 
fork as you would eggs, till they are light and foamy. Serve at 
once, and all who partake will declare it the best way to serve 
potatoes. 

BAKED SWEET POTATOES. 

41. Select potatoes as near the same size as possible; put in 
a baking pan and fill the pan half full, or rather half cover the 
potatoes with water, and bake till done in a hot oven, when the 
water will have cooked down to a rich syrup. 

ANOTHER WAY. 

42. Boil till half done, then take out, put in a baking pan 
dry, and finish cooking in the oven.

BREAD. 



HOT WATER BREAD. 

1. Pour boiling water over Graham flour, making a stiff 
dough ; roll out rather thin, cut into small biscuits ; don't let them 
touch each other in the pan, and bake in a hot oven for twenty 
minutes or half an hour. 

BEAT BISCUITS. 

2. Mix Graham flour with cold water into a stiff dough and 
then beat with a hammer, if you can get one, for fifteen minutes 
to half an hour ; cut into squares, prick on top, and bake in a 
hot oven. All unleavened bread requires a very hot oven. 

GRAHAM GEMS 

3. First be sure you have good brown flour, otherwise you 
need not expect to have good gems. Take one and a half cups 
of cold water, half a cup of sweet milk and enough Graham 
flour to make a batter stiff enough to smooth off well when you 
drop it into your gem pans, which have standing on the stove 
hot and greased enough to prevent sticking ; beat your batter 
well while mixing, and after putting in the hot pans let them 
stand on the stove from two to five minutes, and then put 
in a hot oven and bake half an hour. The only object in 
using the sweet milk is that it helps to brown them. 

DR. FAIRCHILD'S LIGHT BREAD. 

4. Set your yeast over night. Take one part brOwn and 
two parts of white flour; in the morning scald the brown flour 
you are going to use with thin hot cornmeal mush or hot water, 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 



31 



(the mush makes it moist and scalding the flour makes the 
bread sweeter) ; when cool enough add the yeast, making a 
rather soft dough ; let it rise once, as rapidly as possible, knead, 
into pans, and when light, bake in a quick oven. 

SALT-RISING BREAD. 

5. To one quart of warm water add a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of salt ; thicken to a stiff batter with half white and half Graham 
flour; set the vessel containing this batter into another contain- 
ing quite warm, but not hot water. Do this as soon as you can 
in the morning, keeping the water in the outer vessel warm, and 
by one o'clock the yeast ought to be light enough to mix your 
bread, which do by adding enough warm water to make as 
much bread as you require. Mould at once into pans, let it rise, 
say an hour, then bake, and if you do not have sweet light bread, 
it won't be the fault of the directions. 

GRAHAM SODA BISCUITS. 

6. Take as much Graham flour as you think you will need for 
the quantity of biscuits; use a little beef drippings or butter for 
shortening, ve?y little. For the moistening take half butter- milk 
and half cold water (milk alone toughens the biscuits;) use 
half a teaspoonful of soda to a pint of milk and water, knead 
quite stiff and thoroughly ; roll rather thin and bake quickly. 

RYE BISCUITS. 

7. We make the same as Graham soda biscuits, except to 
use the unbolted rye flour ; be sure that it is unbolted. 

RYE LIGHT BREAD. 

8. Two-thirds unbolted rye flour, one-third cold corn meal 
mush; mix with warm water, and as much yeast as you think nee- 



32 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



essary. We usually make it at the same time we make Graham 
light bread and use part of the yeast made for that. Let it rise 
once, mould, and when light bake. 

SODA GEMS. 

9. One teacupful of buttermilk, one of cold water, one 
half teaspoon ful of soda, and Graham flour to make a batter; 
bake in greased gem pans, or drop them by the spoonful in a 
large baking pan, so that they will not touch each other. 

CORN AND GRAHAM GEMS. 

10. Soak cold corn bread over night, or for several hours 
in sour milk, mash up fine, add a little soda, and thicken with 
Graham flour to a rather stiff batter. Bake in gem pans. 

CORN MEAL GEMS. 

11. Take two-thirds of the quantity of corn meal that you 
wish to use, pour over it boiling water enough to make a stiff 
batter, thin with cold sweet milk ; then add the cold corn meal 
till of the right consistency to drop into hot greased gem pans, let 
them stand on the stove a few minutes, and then bake half or 
three-quarters of an hour. 

BATTER BREAD. 

12. Take cold corn meal mush, thin with a little cold sweet 
milk, then add Graham flour and cold corn meal till as thick as 
you think best, which must be very thick ; pour into a baking 
pan and bake half an hour. 

CORN LIGHT BREAD. 

13. Take two quarts of corn meal and scald with boiling 
water to the consistency of mush ; when cool add a pint, or a 
little more of Graham flour, a pinch of salt ; if you have yeast 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 33 

add half a teacupful, it will rise quicker, but it will rise without 
if allowed time ; let it stand till it cracks open on top, then 
bake for two hours. Eat hot or cold. 

CORN AND GRAHAM BISCUITS. 

14. Knead Graham flour into cold corn meal mush until stiff 
enough to mold. Roll, cut out, and bake like biscuits. 

HOMINY MUFFINS. 

15. Mash fine one quart cold-boiled hominey, add one egg, 
half a teacupful of sweet milk, and thicken with white flour. 
Bake in gem pans or muflin rings. 

KENTUCKY CORN BREAD. 

16. Take one pint, or more if you wish, of corn meal; stir 
in cold water enough to make a pretty stiff batter; have your 
iron griddle on the stove, hot and well greased; put on your 
batter, spreading it smoothly, covering all the surface ; when 
browned on the under side, cooking slowly, turn it it over, or if 
you like remove the griddle from the top of the stove to a quick 
oven and bake half or three quarters of an hour. If made rightly 
this is the best and most wholesome corn bread made. Some 
use boiling water instead of cold, in mixing the meal ; either 
way is good. 

SQUASH OR PUMPKIN JOHNNY CAKE. 

17. Pare and stew your squash or pumpkin till well done ; 
mash fine, then stir in while boiling, corn meal enough to make 
a stiff batter, add enough white flour to keep the batter from 
sticking to the griddle, and bake on a griddle or in the oven in 
bread pans. 



34 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



SNOW BREAD. 

1 8. Take equal parts of corn meal or Graham flour and 
dry light snow, stir well together quickly, fill your pans full 
and bake immediately in a hot oven. Eaten warm this is de- 
licious. 

POTATO BISCUITS. 

19. When you have mashed potato left from dinner, take 
it before getting too cold an4 add an equal amount of flour, 
rub thoroughly together, roll out and cut as for biscuit — not 
too thick — and bake in a quick oven till a light brown. 

WHITE GEMS. 

20. One cup of sweet milk, one cup of water; thicken with 
white flour till it will drop easily from the spoon ; beat thorough- 
ly, have your gem pans hot before filling. These do not require 
so hot an oven as the Graham gems. 

HALF-AND-HALF GEMS. 

21. One cup of sweet milk, one cup of cold water, one cup 
of corn meal, and a cup and a half of Graham flour ; beat rap- 
idly for four or five minutes, drop into hot gem pans, and bake 
twenty minutes in a hot oven. 

BREAD OMELET. 

, 2 2. Put into a pan a teacupful of bread crumbs, pour over 
this a teacupful of milk ; salt slightly, and then add two well 
beaten eggs ; fry in as little butter as possible, roll up and serve 
hot. 

JUG YEAST. 

23. Pare and boil in half a gallon of water six potatoes; tie 
a handful of hops in a small cloth and boil with them ; with the 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 35 



liquor scald one teacupful of flour, mash the potatoes and add 
them ; when cool enough add one teacupful of yeast. When 
light put into a jug and keep in a cool place. 

DRY YEAST. 

2 4.. Take three quarts of water, three handfuls of hops and 
boil the hops twenty minutes; take one quart of flour, one hand- 
ful of salt and scald the flour with the hop water; when cooled 
till milk warm add one teacupful of good sweet yeast, previously 
soaked ; let it stand twelve hours, stirring down twice while in 
process of fermentation, then thicken with corn meal stiff" enough 
to make into cakes and let it stand twelve hours longer, then 
make in cakes and put in the shade to dry where it will not 
freeze — turn frequently. 

LIGHT BREAD. 

25. Over one quart of Graham flour pour one and a half 
pints of boiling corn meal mush (the mush should be very thin), 
and when cool enough add half a teacupful of jug yeast or one 
cake of dry and let it stand over night in a warm place ; in the 
morning it should be light ; then work in what flour you need 
for the quantity of bread you wish, adding water if necessary; 
stir up as stiff as you can with a spoon (some think it better to 
knead it well with the hands), and be sure and have it a very 
soft dough ; let it rise, then mould or dip with a spoon into 
pans, (add no flour this time), fill your pans half full and let it 
rise to the top. Bake in a hot oven one hour. 



36 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



PUDDINGS. 



APPLE CUSTARD. 

1. One pint of smooth apple sauce (either green or dried), 
one pint of milk, one cup of sugar, one or two eggs, and flavor 
with lemon or cinnamon. Bake half an hour. This amount 
will make the filling for two pies. 

APPLE DUMPLINGS. 

2. Make a crust of biscuit dough, the same as for hot water 
bread, of either white or Graham flour; pare, quarter and core 
as many nice tart apples as you wish dumplings (or use the 
apple whole, extracting the core) ; cut off a piece of the crust, 
roll out about a quarter of an inch thick, and put in your apple ; 
add sugar and a little allspice, pinch your dough well together, 
put your dumplings in a baking pan as you would biscuit; have 
enough to fill your pan and then pour over them boihng water 
enough to half fill the pan. Bake half an hour in a quick oven. 
Eat hot with fruit sauce or sugar and milk. 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. 

3. Thin slices of bread in layers with apples sliced and 
sugar sprinkled over them (between) ; pour water over, cover 
with a plate and bake a long time in a slow oven. Eat with 
cream or fruit sauce. 

BOILED PUDDING. 

4. Make a rather stiff batter of one pint of buttermilk, one 
pint of cold water, an even teaspoonful of soda and a little salt; 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 37

cherries, currants, etc. Scald and flour a pudding cloth, put 
your batter in, leaving room for swelling, and boil for two 
hours. 

BREAD PUDDING. 

5. Take a quart of bread crumbs and pour over them a 
quart of boiling sweet milk ; when cool add two eggs, a cup of 
sugar, and flavoring to suit the taste. Bake till the custard is 
set. 

BREAD AND APPLE PUDDING. 

6. One quart of bread crumbs, one quart of dried apple 
sauce; alternate layers of crumbs and sauce ; sweeten and flavor 
the sauce to taste. Have a layer of crumbs on top and pour 
over a little water, enough to moisten the bread. Bake half an 
hour. 

COTTAGE PUDDING. 

7. One pint of buttermilk, one teacupful of sugar and 
enough soda to correct the acidity of the milk ; stir in Graham 
flour to make a stiff" cake ; bake quickly and eat hot with fruit 
or lemon sauce. 

CORN MEAL PUDDING. 

8. To five spoonfuls of corn meal scalded with boiHng 
water add a quart of sweet milk, a cup of sugar, a little cinna- 
mon, a pinch of salt and a cup of raisins or currants ; stir it once 
or twice when it first begins to bake. Bake two hours. 

BAKED INDIAN PUDDING. 

9. Eight tablepoonfuls of Indian meal, stirred into three 
pints of scalding milk. Be careful to scald the meal without

letting it boil. Add one pint cold milk, and a little wheat flour 
or not as one pleases, one small teacup of molasses, and, if liked, 
two teacups of chopped sweet apples. Stir well together and 
bake three hours Some mix all together, and set in the oven 
without scalding the meal, stirring it there when it begins to bake 
and it is less trouble and nearly or quite as good. 

GRAHAM PUDDING. 

10. Take sour milk, soda, Graham flour (according to the 
size you want), and make a stiff batter. Put a layer of fruit, 
then a layer of the batter alternately, and bake half an hour. Eat 
with any kind of sauce you like. 

BAKED APPLE PUDDING, 

11. Peel and slice about three quarts good cooking apples;

15. Pour boiling water over a teacupful of tapioca and let 
it stand on the back of the stove till transparent ; have your 
fruit, peaches, berries or tart apples in a baking dish, sweetened 
to taste ; pour the tapioca over and bake till the fruit is cooked. 
Or stir canned fruit in with the tapioca, boil altogether, and 
mold and eat cold. 

TO BOIL RICE SAVANNAH FASHION. 

16. Take one pound of rice and pick it thoroughly over. Put 
on the fire in a porcelain or tin-lined pot, three quarts of water. 
Wash the rice in three waters to get rid of the pulverized rice- 
flour which adheres to the grain. This is a necessity ; otherwise 
the rice never will be dry. Throw the rice in the water when 
it is at the full boil. Let it boil rapidly for twenty minutes. 
Put the cover on and drain the water entirely off. Cover the 
pot, shake well, and put on the back of the stove, where it is not 
too hot, for fifteen minutes. This evaporates all remaining 
moisture. Shake the rice into the dish you wish to serve it in. 
Never use a spoon. Rice should never be glutinous. 

BAKED RICE PUDDING. 

17. One teacupful of well washed rice, one cupful of sugar, 
one cupful of raisins or currants, and two quarts of sweet milk. 
Put the rice and raisins in a pudding dish on the top of the stove 
and pour over them a pint of boiling water; let it stand till the 
rice swells enough to absorb all the water, then add the sugar 
and milk, a little salt, and a very little, if any, of cinnamon. 
Bake in a slow oven two hours. If the milk drys out too much 
add more. Stir occasionally to prevent the top from burning 
and the fruit from settling at the bottom. 



40 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



RICE AND STRAWBERRY PUDDING. 

1 8. Boil one cup of rice till done; have ready, sugared, a 
pint or more of strawberries, stir these into the rice, turn out 
in a glass fruit dish and serve warm, or mould and serve cold 
with milk or cream. 

BLANC-MANGE. 

ig. To one quart of sweet milk allow six tablespoonFuls of 
corn starch ; bring the milk to a boil and then stir in the corn 
starch, dissolved in cold milk. Mould and eat cold. 

FRUIT BLANC-MANGE. 

20. Take one quart of any of the rich dark colored fruit, 
such as cherries, currants, or berries ; after they are prepared as 
for the table as sauce, add four tablespoonfuls of corn starch 
and let it cook two or three minutes ; then mould as blanc- 
mange. It is nice to put this into the mould in alternate layers 
with the white blanc-mange, or with Graham or rye mush. Eat 
cold with cream or fruit sauce. 

OATMEAL BLANC-MANGE. 

2 1. Take one quart of boiling milk, slightly salted, or boil- 
ing water will do, and two heaping tablespoonfuls of oat flour, 
mixed in a little cold water to form a paste, and stir into the 
boiling milk, and continue to stir it twenty minutes. Turn it 
into a mould. May be eaten either cold or warm, with sugar 
and cream. 

FLUMMERY. 

2 2. With one half teacupful of corn starch mix cold milk 
till quite thin ; add to this two quarts of boiling milk, stirring as 
you pour it, and let it boil one minute ; then add three well 
beaten eggs, a cup of sugar dissolved in cold milk, a little salt* 



HOW .TO PREPARE IT. 4 1 



and flavor with lemon extract ; let it boil a minute longer and 
serve warm or cold. It makes a nice sauce for cracked wheat, 
puddings, etc. 

THE MOST DELICATE BLANC-MANGE. 

23. Two parts of milk and one part of water; when it boils 
thicken with equal parts of white flour and corn starch. Mould 
and eat cold with the following sauce : 

COLD LEMON SAUCE. 

24. Into a pint of boiling water stir enough white flour wet 
with cold water to make it the consistency of thin cream ; 
sweeten to taste and add the juice and grated rind of one lemon ; 
let it stand till cold and then use with the above or any of the 
cold blanc-mange or puddings in this book. 

PLAIN CAKE AND FRUIT DESERT. 

25. Cut in slices any plain cake ; put one slice in a saucer 
and pour over it half a teacupful or more of any juicy acid 
stewed fruit, such as cherries or currants, etc. 

RHUBARB BLANC-MANGE. 

26. Prepare your rhubarb as for sauce, then, while boiling, 
stir in bolted rye or sifted Graham flour till stiff enough to mould. 
To be eaten cold with rhubarb or lemon sauce. Delicious. 

ICE CREAM. 

27. Into one quart of rich milk brought to a boil, stir 
enough white flour mixed in a thin batter with cold milk to 
make of tlie consistency of cream ; let it boil a minute or two, 
then run through a seive ; sweeten and flavor to taste, adding a 
small pinch of salt ; set aside till cold and then freeze. Now^ 
don't be disgusted with its plainness, but try it, and it will afford 
you as much satisfaction as the richest custards and creams, 
without their bad effects. 



42 OUR DAILY BRifAD. 



LEMON ICE. 

28. Make near a gallon of rather thick corn starch and to 
this amount add the juice of five or six lemons, and sugar to 
suit your taste (the less the better for you), one teaspoonful of 
lemon extract or a little of the grated rind of the lemon, and a 
scant half teaspoonful of salt ; freeze as you would ice cream. 

LEMON TAPIOCA. 

29. One teacupful of tapioca soaked over night in one 
quart of water ; in the morning let it simmer slowly till trans- 
parent, then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, one 
cup of sugar, one tablespoonful of corn starch and pour into 
moulds. Serve cold with or without sauce. 

BRAN JELLY. 

30. Into three quarts of boiling water stir bran enough to 
make it the consistency of gruel ; let it boil half or three-quar- 
ters of an hour and then strain through a fine seive. Put the 
liquor back in the pot and let it come to a boil ; stir in enough 
sifted Graham flour, wet in cold water to a smooth batter so it 
will not lump, to make it as stiff as blanc-mange ; mould and 
eat cold with cream or any of the sauces. Allways wet your 
mould in cold water before filling, to prevent sticking. This 
jelly is more nutritious than beef tea and an excellent substitute 
for it. 

GIRAFFE STRAWBERRY DESSERT. 

31. I thus denominate this dessert, as it was the result of 
one of our experiments, and nameless. After eating it we all 
wished that the gustatory pleasure might be prolonged, and 
could see no harmless way to reach the desideratum unless it 
would be to have necks like a giraffe, so the good taste might be 
longer continued. Make a batter of two cups very sour milk, 
one heaping cup sugar, one heaping tablespoonful butter; mix the 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 43 

sugar and butter well together ; add lemon flavoring ; then pour 
in the sour milk and stir in part of the flour — good Graham 
flour; dissolve one teaspoonful of soda with a spoonful of hot 
water, and add this and enough more flour to make a moderate- 
ly stiff" batter — not too stiff". Have your jelly cake pans butter- 
ed, and bake this in delicate layers as for jelly cake. Now 
make a frosting, using the whites of two eggs and fine sugar 
enough to thicken so it can be spread on each layer. On taking 
the pans from the oven, cut with a large sized biscuit cutter 
a hole directly in the centre of each layer. Place a 
layer on a large white plate, spread on some frosting, and so 
on to the last, then frost the sides and top ; this leaves a ''well" 
in the middle of the cake. Just as you sit down to dinner fill 
this " well " with mashed and sweetened strawberries ; place a 
row of large fine berries around the top, and a wreath of myrtle 
around the bottom of the cake ; intersperse this with the red 
berries. To serve, cut this as you would jelly cake, putting 
with each piece a portion of the jam. It calls for no other 
trimmings. 

Stewed and thickened strawberries are also nice for this. 
The same may be varied by filling the " well" with soft peaches, 
canned peaches, any kind of berries, or even ice cream or lemon 
ice. 

Nice tart apples, stewed and run through a hair-seive; 
then the white of an egg beaten to a stiff froth and stirred with 
this, adding sugar and a little nutmeg, makes nice filling. This 
is also nice for tarts, or to be eaten with plain cake as dessert. 

STRAWBERRY SHORT CAKE 

32. Make nice biscuit dough; roll quite thin, though not 
as thin as for pie crust ; bake in large sheets in a dripping pan ; 
then cut in pieces to fit "a large platter. Have ready a quantity 
of mashed and sweetened strawberries, and spread this thickly 



44 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



over the first crust ; then put on another layer, and spread more 
of the jam, and so on for as many layers as you like. Around 
the edge of the dish place a row of very nice large whole ber- 
ries, and if you like, make a pyramid of berries on the top, and 
sprinkle with powdered sugar. This does not need cream and 
sugar, or even butter, to be eaten with it. Stewed strawberries, 
the juice thickened to a jelly with corn starch and sweetened, 
is very nice to use in this way. Any kind of berries may be 
substituted for strawberries, and its name changed accordingly. 

BAKED CUSTARD. 

^^. To one quart of mock cream, made the same as for ice 
cream, take one egg beaten with half a cupful of sugar, or more 
sugar if preferred. Mix the egg and sugar with the cream, when 
the cream has cooled so as not to allow the egg to coagulate. 
"Add salt and vanilla or lemon flavoring. Bake until the custard is. 
■just turned. This makes nice filling for crust, thus calling it 
custard pie. 

APPLE PUDDING. 

34. Peel and stew nice tart apples until well done ; then 
stir slowly in this sauce dry corn meal until you have a delicate 
mush. Cook half an hour or more. Serve hot as dessert^ 
Cream and sugar, or mock cream sauce, or nice syrup, may be 
eaten with this. 

FLOATING ISLAND. 

35. To one quart of mock cream, use two eggs. First 
bring the milk to a boil; have the whites of the eggs beaten to 
a stiff froth; dip a spoonful at a time of this into the scalding 
milk ; turn it over and let it remain a moment, just long enough 
to "set" the egg. Put this in a dish; have some thin white 
fiour batter, with which thicken the milk, till of the consistency 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 45 



of thick cream. Run it through a seive, and while hot add the 
yolks of the eggs, beaten with sugar, and some cold milk, so the 
yolks will not curdle; stir briskly and set to cool; flavor with 
lemon and put in a pinch of salt. This may be brought to the 
table in a large glass dish or in individual glasses. The whites 
of the eggs will be placed on top of the dish. Some like colored 
sugar sprinkled over the top. It is prettier in its pure white- 
ness. 



SAUCES FOR PUDDINGS. 

LEMON SAUGE. 

1. Four tablespoonfuls of white flour or common starch ; 
mix smoothly, so that there shall be no lumps, with half a tea- 
cupful of cold water ; pour over this a pint of boiling water, 
stirring all the time. Put on the stove ; add a teacupful of 
sugar, the grated rind and juice of one lemon and a small pinch 
of salt. If stiffer than you like add more hot water. Let it 
cook for ten minutes. 

ORANGE SAUCE. 

2. Orange sauce we make the same as the above, substi- 
tuting for the lemon the juice of two oranges, though none of 
the rind. 

FRUIT SAUCE. 

3. Take a quart of the juice of any fruit; if too rich make 
it half water ; sweeten to taste, and while hot add a tablespoon- 
ful of corn starch. This is nice for fruit blanc-mange or any of 
the flour blanc-manges. 



46 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



PATENT CREAM. 

4. One quart of sweet milk brought to a boil, into which 
stir a tablespoonful of corn starch. Cook one minute, not 
more. 

JELLY SAUCE. 

5. This is made the same as lemon sauce, only instead of 
the lemon use any fruit jelly or jam for flavoring. 

MILK GRAVY. 

6. To a quart of good sweet milk as it comes to the boiling 
point add a heaping tablespoonful of superfine flour, mixed to a 
batter with milk or cream, adding a beaten egg. As soon as 
the mixture boils it is ready for the table. If allowed to boil 
over half a minute it is nearly spoiled, the creaminess which 
nice care in cooking gives it being lost. 

PUDDING SAUCE. 

7. The same gravy made thinner, without the egg, and 
sweetened, and, perhaps, with a little more cream added, makes 
a very nice sauce for puddings and dumplings. 



PIES. 

Fruit pies should be made generally with cooked fruit, 
when very rich crust is not used, because the time required for 
cooking the raw fruit when inside the pie is so disproportioned 
to that which the crust requires, as to bring the crust overdone 
or the fruit underdone. In making apple pie I prefer to have 
the fruit stewed and seasoned before putting into tht crust. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 47 



Berries, grapes, plums, etc., require a little thickening of 
corn starch or white flour. Add this in the form of a smooth, 
thin batter to the boiling fruit as it is about to be removed from 
the stove. The right consistency of the juice thus prepared 
should be that of a light jelly. 

Tomato pie is very nice made like any fruit pie — stewing 
the tomatoes, sweetening and adding some flavoring — lemon is 
mostly preferred. 

PREPARED SUET OR SHORTENING. 

1. To one pound of nice white beef suet, cut fine, put one 
quart of cold water ; boil this until the water is wholly evapor- 
ated, then simmer a few moments and strain. Salt may be 
added if preferred. This, if well prepared, makes the most de- 
sirable material for shortening. For most uses I prefer it tO' 
butter in point of wholesomeness. It has no flavor of *' tallow," 
which is always present when suet is merely " tried out," with- 
out first being subjected to the boiling process. 

PIE GRUST. 

2. One cup of prepared suet to two cups cold water, 
and a small pinch of soda — less than one-fourth of a teaspoon- 
ful. Have the suet somewhat softened by being placed near 
the fire ; rub this into a small quantity of flour until well mixed; 
add the soda first, then the water. Make a stifl" dough, work it 
well and roll very thin. Graham flour requires less shortening 
than white flour. We use Graham flour for pie crust. 

ANOTHER WAY 

3. Take equal quantities of mashed potatoes and flour, 
adding a little cream if liked. Roll this kind of crust a little 
thicker. 



48 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



STILL ANOTHER. 

4. An easier crust to make is to wet up the flour with milk 
or cream — the more cream the richer. Even sour cream needs 
no soda, or but little, and shortens better than sweet cream. 

CUSTARD PIES. 

5. Two pints of milk, two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of 
white flour, one cup of sugar. Bring half the milk to a boil ; 
stir in the flour dissolved in half a cup of cold water ; let 
it boil a minute; then take off and add the cold milk, sugar and 
last the eggs, well beaten. Flavor with lemon. This makes 
two pies. 

FRUIT COBBLER. 

6. Make a biscuit crust; line with it the bottom and sides 
of a baking pan ; have your fruit ready cooked and sweetened 
to taste ; put it in your pan, and cover with an upper crust. 
Bake till the crust is done. Remove it from the oven, take off 
the top crust, lay it on a platter, spread over it a thick layer of 
the fruit ; then cut the side crusts loose and lay on the top of 
the fruit, then more fruit, then the bottom crust, and if there is 
still more fruit pour it over the top. Good either hot or cold, 
with or without sauce. If you make it of apples or peaches it is 
not necessary to thicken the juice, but if of berries or cherries, 
stir in a little white flour when cooking before putting into the 
pie. 

ANOTHER COBBLER. 

7. Another cobbler, more easily made, is to bake a cake of 
biscuit dough rolled out half an inch thick. When done split it 
in two with a sharp knife, lay on a platter, and pour your pre- 
pared fruit over it, having plenty of juice.

SQUASH PIE. 

8. Stew squash thoroughly, allowing it to stew down quite 
dry ; rub it through a collander. To one pint of squash add 
one spoonful of white flour, mix well, and pour over this a scant 
pint of boiling milk ; a pinch of salt ; flavor and sweeten to 
taste. Pumpkin may be treated similarly. 

TARTS. 

9. Make a crust of Graham flour and sweet cream ; roll 
thin ; cut out with a biscuit cutter, and line gem pans with it, 
or turn up the edge of each and pinch it in place ; prick with a 
fork to prevent blistering. Bake quickly. Take out of the pans 
and put on plates to cool. Fill with any nice fruit sauce or with 
filling for cream pie. 

RICE PIE. 

10. Take one pint of cold boiled rice, one pint of sweet 
milk, one egg, and two-thirds of a cup of sugar ; stir all well to- 
gether. This amount will make two pies. Add more milk if 
you wish it thinner. Bake with an under crust, as custard pie. 

APPLE PIE. 

11. Bake with lower and upper crust. Cut tart apples into 
quarters ; fill the pie plate heaping full ; sweeten, add a little 
water, and put on the top crust. Bake slowly till the apples are 
cooked, which should be about half an hour. 

CREAM PIE. 

12. Bake your crust first, and lift it out on a plate. For 
filling take half a pint sweet milk and half a pint of water ; 
bring to a boil ; then stir in two heaping tablespoonfuls of white 
flour made into a smooth batter with a little cold milk. Then 
add the yolk of one egg, half a teacupful ol sugar, a pinch of 



50 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



-salt, and flavor with lemon or vanilla, and pour into the crust. 
Beat the white of the egg to a froth with one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, and spread over the pie. Put it in the oven and 
let it brown. To be eaten cold. 

LEMON PIE. 

13. Into one pint of boiling water stir three tablespoonfuls 
of corn starch and one cup of sugar and a little salt ; let it stand 
till cool; then add the juice and grated rind of one lemon and 
the yolk of an egg. Bake till done ; then spread over the top 
the white of the egg beaten stiff, to which add one spoonful of 
sugar. Return to the oven and brown. 



CAKE. 

HYGIENE CAKE. 

1. One cup of sugar, one cup of sour cream (or half cup of 
sour milk and two tablespoonfuls of butter), one scant teaspoon- 
ful of soda and two eggs ; flavor with lemon extract ; thicken 
with Graham flour, not quite so stiff as if you were using white 
flour. Bake as a loaf cake, or in layers with jelly between. 

You can make a jelly at any time for this by taking any 
acid fruit juice — pie plant, cherry, etc. — sweetening to suit the 
taste, and thickening to a jelly with corn starch. Spread it on 
the cakes while warm. 

GINGER BREAD. 

2. One cup of sugar, one cup of molasses, one tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter, one teacupful of sour milk, one teaspoonful 
soda, one of ginger, and one of cinnamon. Thicken with Gra- 
ham flour and bake twenty minutes.

GRAHAM COOKIES. 

3. Two cups of sugar, two cups of hot water, one cup of 
butter, one half teaspoonful of soda; flavor with a little cinna- 
mon or lemon. Mould soft with Graham flour and bake in a 
quick oven. 

GRAHAM COOKIES NO. 2. 

4. One cup of sour cream, one cup of sugar, one half tea- 
spoonful of soda. Flavor to taste. Mould very soft. 

YEAST CAKE. 

5. To two cups of light bread dough add one cup of sugar, 
one heaping tablespoonful of butter, one half cup of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful of either cinnamon or ginger. Drop from a 
spoon into gem pans, and let them stand till light ; then bake. 

SOFT GINGER BREAD. 

6. One cup of molasses, one cup of sugar, one cup of hot 
water, one tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of soda ; 
mix not very stiff with Graham flour; flavor with ginger or cin- 
namon or both to taste. Bake quickly. 

FRUIT CAKE. 

7. One cup of butter, two cups sour milk, three cups sugar, 
two teaspoonfuls soda, one teaspoonful cinnamon, one of cloves, 
and one of ginger; of currants and chopped raisins more or less 
as desired. Brown half of the flour used, and make not very 
stiff. Bake four hours in a slow oven. This improves with 
age. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

8. Two cups of sugar, four eggs, two cups of sifted Graham 
flour, one cup boiling water, two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 



52 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



der; flavor with lemon or vanilla. Beat the eggs and sugar 
together for twenty minutes, add the flour and baking powder 
and flavoring, and last the boiling water. Bake immediately, 
in not too hot an oven. May be baked in layers, with jelly or 
cocoanut between. 

PLAIN CAKE. 

9. One cup sugar, one cup sour milk, one teaspoonful 
soda ; rather thin batter with Graham flour ; lemon flavoring. 
Eat warm. 

WHITE CAKE. 

10. Whites of two eggs beaten till very light, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one and a half cups of sugar beaten to a 
cream, half a cup of sweet milk, one teaspoonful of baking 
powder, one and a half or two cups of flour 3 flavor to taste. 

DELICATE CAKE. 

II. Whites of four eggs, one cup of sweet milk, half a cup of 
butter, two cups of sugar, two and a half cups of flour, and two 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 

LEMON JELLY FOR LAYER CAKE. 

12. One cup of sugar, one egg, one tablespoonful butter, 
the gratedf ind and juice of one lemon ; boil till thick. 

CREAM FILLING FOR CAKE. 

13. One half cup of sweet milk, three tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, one tablespoonful of fine flour: boil till thick; flavor 
with vanilla. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 53 



FRUITS. 



Cooked fruit should never be sweetened until just as it is 
taken from the fire. Jellies made similarly are better, allowing 
the juice to boil well before adding the sugar, and one fourth 
sugar is better than one half. 

BAKED APPLE SAUCE. 

1. Quarter and core, but do not pare, your apples; put 
them in a deep baking dish, earthen ware is best, and add 
enough water to nearly fill the dish ; bake in a slow oven for 
two, three or more hours ; do not let them burn. It is a good 
plan to cover them with a plate while baking. If the water all 
evaporates add more, so that the apples will be juicy when done- 
Persons whose stomachs are so weak that they can eat apples 
cooked in no other way, can eat this sauce. The long cooking 
does away with the need of sugar. We make our boiled apple 
sauce in the same way, cooking slowly for two or three hours, but 
the baked is nicer. 

PIE PLANT. 

2. Wash the stalks, cut off the leaves, cut the stalks into 
inch pieces and fill a pudding or other baking dish full; add 
water till near the top, but not so that it will run over when it 
begins to cook. Bake for two hours slowly, so that the pieces 
will not break ; about fifteen minutes before taking out pour 
over it the sugar and a tablespoonful of corn starch to a quart of 
the fruit, dissolved in water. Let it boil up well together, then 
take up and let it cool in the dish it is baked in. Nothing could 
be nicer. 



54 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



GOOSEBERRIES. 



3. Put your berries in an earthen or porcelain kettle or pan 
and pour over them enough boiling water to almost cover 
them; when cooked add sugar to taste and enough corn starch 
so that the juice will be about as thick as thin cream. 



CHERRIES, CURRANTS, BERRIES, ETC. 

4. These may all be cooked in the same way as the goose- 
berries, adding corn starch, if preferred, or if the fruit is very 
juicy. As we do not approve of drinking at meals, we like to 
have our fruit as juicy as possible. In all the sauces we wse as 
little sugar as we can and yet have the fruit palatable. 



DRIED FRUITS. 

5. Dried apples and peaches we wash in two or three waters. 
Apples will cook in three hours but peaches take longer. Peaches 
are better if mashed up when almost done. We sometimes cook 
the two together, mashing them up when done. We also add 
raisins or currants, as this gives us a variety in sauces. We use 
no sugar with these. Prunes we cook in a good deal of water, 
adding a little sugar ; the prunes absorb so much water that 
to have any juice at all when cold we have to cook them in a 
large quantity of water and sugar to give a little more body to 
to the juice. 

Many pleasant combinations can be made by mixing the 
different fruits ; as peaches with apples, raspberries with apples, 
raspberries with blackberries, etc. This to many is an improve- 
ment. Thus, peaches alone are too rich, but mixed in small 
proportions with apples add very much to their excellence, 
either for pies or sauce. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 55 



CRANBERRIES. 

6. We use two parts cranberries and one part raisins, 
cooked together, and think it a great improvement, as then the 
cranberries do not require as much sugar. A little corn starch 
added to this sauce is also ,an improvement. 

CANNED FRUITS. 

7. We always open twelve hours before using, that the car- 
bonic acid gas may escape ; or else bring it to a boil, which has 
the same effect. Peaches, especially, should be so treated. 

ORANGE AND LEMON EXTRACTS. 

8. Pare the orange or lemon before extracting the juice ; 
lay the peeling by to dry until you have as much as you wish, 
then put into a tightly corked bottle and cover with alcohol ; let 
it stand four or five days and then pour off and bottle for use. 
This is far superior to any extract you can buy. 



TOAST. 



MILK TOAST. 



I. Cut bread in even slices ; cover the bottom of a large 
dripping pan with them and put in a hot oven ; if it browns on 
the top first turn the slices over ; this is the nicest way to 
make toast as then it is toasted through and only requires 
enough attention to keep it from burning. While this is toast- 
ing prepare your mock cream by adding to one quart of boiling 
milk one heaping tablespoonful of fine flour mixed in a smooth 
batter with cold milk ; salt slightly and boil one minute, not 
longer. Have ready a pan of boiling water into which dip each 



56 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



slice of toast ; lay in a dish and when full pour over all the 
dressing. 

Brown bread is used in all these toasts. It is realy much 
nicer than the white. 

CODFISH TOAST. 

2. Prepare the toast as for milk toast, only dip each slice in 
boiling milk instead of water ; put a layer of slices in a dish and 
spread over this a layer of codfish (which is prepared by being 
soaked for an hour or two in hot water, well picked to pieces ; 
put over the fire, with a little cream or milk and batter added, 
and brought to a boil), then another layer of toast, alternating 
till the dish is full ; over this pour the mock cream. 

EGG TOAST. 

3. Dip each slice of toast in boiling milk, lay on a platter, 
and then on each slice put a poached egg. Serve hot. 

MINCE BEEF TOAST. 

4. Take round steak or cold rare steak, chop fine and put 
in a skillet with a little water, butter and salt; let it simmer for 
half a minute or so.' Have your toast prepared as for egg 
toast, spread some of the meat over each slice and send to the 
table smoking hot. 

CORN BREAD TOAST. 

5. Cut cold corn bread into slices, toast in the oven, dip in 
water and pour over it the milk dressing. It is very nice to use 
some corn and some Graham bread together for milk toast. 

TOMATO TOAST. 

6. Pour over nicely browned toast stewed ripe or green 
tomatoes, or if preferred fry the tomatoes, either ripe or green, 
season, lay on slices of toast dipped in boiling milk. 

CREAM TOAST. 

7. Dip slices of toast in boiling water, then pour on each 
slice two or three tablespoonfuls of cream. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 57 



MUSHES. 



CORN MEAL MUSH. 

1. If you can get it use the unbolted corn meal and sift it. 
To three quarts of boiling water add one pint of corn meal mixed 
smoothly in one pint of cold water; stir briskly while pouring 
in this batter. The mixture will look more like gruel than 
mush, but by the time it has boiled two hours (it is not fit to eat 
with less cooking) it will be thick enough, and you will say it is 
the best mush you ever ate. Some add a teaspoonful of salt to 
the above quantity. Let your mush boil for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, stirring all the time, and then set on the back of the 
stove and stir occasionally. 

In the winter you can make a large quantity of mush and 
either fry or bake for breakfast the next morning. To bake it 
put as much as you wish in a baking pan and put in a hot oven 
for half an hour or more. You can not cook corn meal too 
much. 

GRAHAM MUSH. 

2. Graham and rye mush we make in the same way as corn 
meal mush, only that it takes twice as much flour to the quan- 
tity of water and does not need to cook more than half an hour. 
These mushes we often mould and eat cold with any of the 
pudding sauces or sugar and cream. Dates stirred in with the 
Graham mush and then eaten cold with milk or cream is de- 
licious. 

OAT MEAL PORRIDGE. 
5. Into one quart of boiling water stir one teacupful of 
granulated oats, and let it boil actively two hours. Boil it in a 
double boiler, and do not take off the lid or stir it until done,, 
when it may be stirred thoroughly and poured into a mould. 



58 OUR DAILY BREAD. 



OAT MEAL MUSH. 

4. Oat meal mush we seldom make as it is too strong food 
for a week stomach, but strong healthy people can digest it. 
Make it as Graham mush, only do not stir it more than necessa- 
ry to keep it from burning and let it cook for an hour. . Most 
people make their mushes too stiff; they are not nearly so deli- 
cate. You do not want it stiff enough to cut with a knife, but 
so it will almost run from the spoon — especially if you wish to 
mould it;. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 

5. Is best cooked in a double boiler, so that it needs no 
stirring; cook two or three hours. Longer does not hurt it. If 
you like cook raisins with it and add sugar and a little cream 
or milk half an hour before taking up. This makes a nice des- 
sert. 

HOMINY. 

6 Wash in two or three waters, a quart of hominy ; have 
a kettle half full of boiling water (be sure it is boiling), then put 
your hominy in and let it cook fully half a day. All day will 
be better. Stir it often enough to keep from burning ; if more 
water is needed add it boiling hot. When ready for use add a 
little salt, cream or milk, and serve hot. It is just as good (or 
better) every time it is warmed over ; only season as much at a 
time as you wish to use. In winter you can cook enough at 
one time to last a week. It is nice cut in slices, rolled in flour, 
and fried in a little butter or suet. 

FRIED CORN MEAL MUSH. 

7. Cut in slices a quarter of an inch thick, roll in white flour 
and fry a delicate brown in as little butter or suet as you can use. 
Don't burn it on one side and leave it white on the other. 
Oat meal or Graham mush is nice prepared in the same ^ay. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 59 



TO WARM OVER HOMINY. 

8. Put into the vessel as much hominy as you want to use, 
then mash it well with the potato masher ; add a little milk and 
salt, and stir constantly while over the fire. Don't use to much 
milk; half a pint to a quart of hominy will be enough. 



GRIDDLE CAKES. 



BREAD GRIDDLE CAKES. 

1. Soak dry bread, either Graham or corn meal, over night 
in sour milk. In the morning beat it up well, add enough soda 
to correct the acidity of the milk, and enough graham flour to 
make it a thin batter. Fry on griddles just greased enough to 
prevent sticking. These cakes are light, and eaten with a little 
sugar or syrup are delicious. 

BRAN CAKES. 

2. Take one pint of bran, pour boiling water over it and 
let it stand over night ; in the morning add one egg, a pint of 
sour milk, one teaspoonful of soda and thicken with corn meal. 
Fry as griddle cakes. 

HOMINY GRIDDLE CAKES. 

3. Mash well one pint of cold boiled hominy, add one 
pint of sour milk and one teaspoonful of soda or sweet milk and 
one egg; thicken with white or Graham flour. 

EARL'S PANNIE CAKES. 

4. One quart of sour milk, as little soda as possible, thick- 
ened with equal quantities of Graham flour, white flour and corn 
meal. 



6o OUR DAILY BREAD. 



YEAST GRIDDLE CAKES. 

5. Take two quarts of warm water, make a thin batter with 
either Graham, rye or buckwheat flour, add half a teacupful of 
yeast. Let it set in a warm place over night. In the morning, 
if the batter is too thick (as the flour swells), add water to make 
it of the right consistency. These cakes, we think more whole- 
some than those made of sour milk and soda. 

CORN MUSH PATTIES. 

6. One pint and a half of cold corn mush and to this add 
half a teacupful of sweet milk ; mix well together and then stir 
in three tablespoonfuls of corn meal and one of white flour, and 
drop from the end of a spoon on to hot greased griddles, putting 
some eight or nine on at once. They are more delicate cooked 
in small cakes ; (this is true of all griddle cakes. When well 
browned on one side, turn as other cakes, and serve hot. 

CORN MEAL GRIDDLE CAKES. 

7. Take one quart of sweet milk and a pint and a half of 
corn meal, bring half the milk to a boil, and with it scald half 
the meal, then add the cold milk, the rest of the meal, and two 
tablespoonfuls of white flour, or an eg5 if you prefer. Bake in 
small thin cakes and they will be light and tender. 

WAFFLES. 

8. To one pint of sweet milk add one pint of boiling water 
and while warm stir in Graham flour enough to make a thin bat- 
ter, then add half a teacupful of jug yeast or a small yeast cake, 
and let it stand in a warm place all night. In the morning 
warm and grease with suet your waffle irons, pour in the batter 
and bake each side about two minutes. 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 6l 



GRUELS. 



CORN MEAL GRUEL. 

1. Have the water boiling; make a thin batter of corn 
meal and cold water and put one tablespoonful of this batter in 
the boiling water ; let this boil up, then add the rest, a table- 
spoonful at a time, or at first, and let it boil an hour or more. 

Other gruels are made in the same way, except rice gruel. 

RICE GRUEL. 

2. Boil a teacupful of rice in two quarts of water, or so 
much water that a pint of gruel will be left when the rice is 
done. The thin gruel may be obtained by pouring the well 
boiled rice in a seive, thus straining it. In some cases a little, 
a tablespoonful or so, of meat broth may be added, and very 
little salt — the less the better. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 



PONHAUS OR WINTER MUSH FOR FRYING. 

I. This dish should be used only in cold weather, hence we 
designate it as above. To two pounds of rough pieces of lean 
beef, or of scraps you may have on hand, put one gallon of 
water and boil till the meat is very tender. Take it from the 
pot and chop or mash find. Strain the liquor and replace it in 
the pot, adding the chopped meat, and seasoning with salt, sage 



St OUR DAILY BREAD. 

or summer savory, and garlic"; or onions to taste. Stir in this 
boiling mass enough corn meal to make a moderately stiff mush. 
Put it when well cooked into a pan to get cold. Slice neatly, 
roll in white flour, and fry a delicate brown on a well greased 
griddle. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. ^ 

2. Bring skim milk to a scald, almost but not quite boiling,' 
Now pour into this enough buttermilk to turn the whole mass to 
curds and whey. (It is not possible to give the exact propor- 
tions, as the acid of the buttermilk varies in quantity proportion- 
ate to the age of the milk, etc). Now skim out the curd and 
put it in a bag of thin tough muslin made for this purpose, and 
let it drain till quite dry, then turn out into a pan and with the 
hands Mtork it into a smooth mass, putting in a small piece :of; 
butter and a little salt. Make into small balls. This, if made 
just right, is the most delicious cottage cheese ever invented. 

CREAM CURD. 

3. Take " klaughbered" milk and place it on a warm, not 
hot, stove until the curds and whey separate, then pour into a 
collander and let it drain thoroughly. Put this in a dish and 
pour over it salted cream, or cream without the salt — enough to 
cover well the curd. 



BUTTER MILK CHEESE. 

'.4. Put new buttermilk over a slow fire, there to remain un-j 
til almost scalding hot, when the curd will separate. Pour the; 
whole in a cheese bag and hang up to drip. This should be:wel\.. 
worked with the hand, a little butter or cream, and salt ^dded.^ 
Make into Httle balls and keep in a cool place. ': 



HOW TO PREPARE IT. 6^ 

BAKING POWDER. 

5. Six ounces of pure tartaric acid, eight ounces of the best 
baking soda and one quart of flour, sift five or six times through 
a fine sieve, so as to thoroughly mix the ingredients. Always 
procure the best material. Keep tightly corked and use as any 
other baking powder. 

JELLIES. 

6. After preparing the juice take a pint and a half of it and 
boil rapidly for fifteen minutes ; have in the oven heating half 
a pint of best white sugar, add this to the boiling juice and boil 
five minutes longer, or until it will leave the spoon ; boiling it 
one minute too long will make syrup of it. If you like your jelly 
sweeter add a little more sugar, but the quantity given is better, 
while some prefer the mixture in the preportion of three or four 
parts of juice to one of sugar. 

LEMONADE. 

7. Lemonade must always be made from from peeled lem- 
ons. To one lemon take one tablespoonful of sugar, mash the 
lemon and sugar well together, then add a glass of water, and, 
if desirable, a piece of ice. 

Hot lemonade may be made in the same way, using boiling 
water. Less sugar may be used or none at all, in making either 
hot or cold lemonade.

AND MOVEMENT CURE. 

Corner Broadway and Sixth Street, QUINCY, ILL 



In every respect a First-Class Medical Institution, de- 
voted to the treatment and care of Invalid Women. 



ITS FACILITIES ARE UNEQUALLED. 



Only tlie Most Scientific, Rational and Speedy Methods are employed. 



1. I have Steam Propelled Mechanical Apparatus in great variety, for apply- 
ing numerous forms of remedial or medicinal motioix, which cannot be effected by any 
other means Curative operations by the hand, and special movements also comprise 
the treatment by JNIotion, 

2. Baths. One side of the principal bath-room is of glass. I have Full Baths, 
Electrical, Electro-Vapor, Electro-Thermal, Hot .Air, Vapor, Spray, etc., etc., besides 
every other essential lor ireatment. 

3. During the twenty years of my medical practice I have, by experience and ob- 
servation, become confirmed in the OfMnion hf-ld by many eminent physicians, both in 
this country and Europe, that the best medical results are secured where no large num- 
ber of invalids are congregated at any one time in one infirmary or Cure. Acting upon 
this, I purchased an elegant private residence, peculiarly adapted to my purpose. It is 
a restful, cheerful, home, for the small number, only about twenty of invalid women 
who can be received at any one time. The house is a sub.'^.tantially built brick, with high 
ceilings, ample southern piazzas, large, higli, southward sloping grounds, and situated 
in one of the most desirable residence portions of this " most beautiful city of the West " 
Opposite is a grand elm-shaded park, in the centre of which stands the magnificent Court 
House, thus affording a fine architectural as well as rural front. Street cars within one 
block. Churches and places of amusement in close proximity. 

4. My table is abundantly supplied with most carefully prepared and excellent food. 

Invalid Women everywhere are invited to send for my illustrated and descriptive 
Circular. Address,
