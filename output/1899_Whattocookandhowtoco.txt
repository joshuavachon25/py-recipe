PREFACE. 



"The less refined, the less they cook." — Hood. 



Cooking is a fine art, and to be successful one 
must be painstaking, thorough in detail, and be 
guided by a system of rules, which I will try to give 
and make so plain that anyone can follow them and 
make a success of the dishes they undertake. 

This is indeed a day of cook books, most of them 
containing several thousand receipts, which is con- 
fusing and bewildering. Hence it is not my aim to 
see how many receipts I can place before the public, 
but how good receipts I can give. None will be 
found in the book that have not been thoroughly 
tested and that will not prove satisfactory if the 
directions are followed. 

Study the principles laid down plainly in the 
very beginning, apply them to all food material, use 
common sejise and ingenuity, and one can make an 
endless variety of dishes. 



DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS. 



Boiling is immersing the article to be cooked in 
water after it has reached the boiling point. 

Steaming is cooking by exposing the food to 
steam. 

Stewing is boiling the food in a small quantity of 
water. The article to be stewed is generally cut into 
pieces. 

Baking is cooking food inside the oven. 

Roasting is cooking before a clear fire by sus- 
pending the article and allowing it to revolve. 

Broiling is quickly searing or browning the food 
before the cooking begins in order to shut in the 
juices. It can be done successfully on top of a stove, 
over a bed of live coals, or in a hot oven. 

Fricasseeing is sauteing food and then stewing. 

Sauteing is frying in a small quantity of fat — 
cooking the food on one side and then turning it 
over and cooking the other side. 

Frying is cooking food by immersing in hot fat, 



fi DIRECTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS. 

To Test the Fat. — When it begins to smoke, put 
into it a thin slice of potato, If it sinks to the bot- 
tom and stays, then it is not hot enough to cook any- 
thing. If it rises to the top in a minute, it is right 
for uncooked food. If the potato does not sink at 
all, but comes to the top and browns in one minute, 
it is at the right temperature for browning crumbed 
articles that have been previously cooked — as cro- 
quettes, etc. Olive oil and lard and beef drippings 
are generally used for frying. It can be clarified 
and used a number of times. 

To Clarify Fat. — Add slices of raw potato and 
heat the fat gradually until the potato browns. 
Strain through a cloth or fine sieve. When the fat 
is much discolored you can add, ,when it is cold, one 
quart of boiling water and one-half teaspoonful of 
soda. Stir constantly and take off the scum that 
rises. Let it boil a few minutes and set aside to 
cool. The fat will form a cake which can be removed. 
Put it on the fire and let it melt. All of the water 
evaporates and the remaining impurities settle at the 
bottom. Then pour off the clear fat. 



PREPARING ARTICLES FOR COOKING. 



Use for crumbing, stale light bread; you can use' 
crackers or stale biscuit, but light bread is preferable. 
Save all the pieces trimmed from bread when mak- 
ing toast or sandwiches, the crust edges are good. 
Hang up in a paper sack in a dry place, or if wanted 
for immediate use, dry by putting in a warm oven or 
a warmer. Grind in a meat grinder and sift. Use. 
the sifted crumbs for the outside crumbing and the 
others for puddings and cooked mixtures. 

Egg used for crumbing is beaten enough to mix 
the yolk and white well and diluted with water or 
sweet milk, allowing two tablespoons of liquid tO' 
each egg. 

Larding is drawing small pieces of salt pork 
through the surface of lean meat. Out the pieces of 
pork into one-fourth inch strips, press them into the 
needle and take stitches at regular intervals, leaving 
the lardoons projecting on either side. It adds ta 
the appearance and very much to the flavor of lean, 
meats. 

Daubing is making incisions into meat and insert- 
ing strips of pork or prepared dressing. 

Boning is freeing the flesh from the bones, leav- 
ing the meat whole, and is done with a sharp-pointed 
knife for cutting and a dull one for scraping the.

8 PREPARING ARTICLES FOR COOKING, 

bones. A boned fowl is generally stuffed with meat 
that has been cooked, ground, and seasoned, then 
pressed into shape and served hot; or the stuffing 
can be highly seasoned and a little gelatine and hard 
boiled eggs used. This is served in thin slices, cold. 
Trussing is shaping fowls for baking or boiling 
by tying or by the use of skewers. 



MEASURING AND MIXING. 



Flour, meal, powdered sugar, baking powder and 
soda should always be sifted before using. 

Use tin or glass cups holding one-half pint, 
divided into fourths and thirds. To insure good 
results correct measurements are absolutely neces- 
sary. Do not put the cup into the flour or meal and 
dip it up, but put the ingredients into the cup by 
spoonfuls until it is level full. 

Do not confound stirring, beating and folding. 

To stir is to blend ingredients with a circular 
motion. 

To heat is to turn ingredients over and over, 
bringing the under surface continually to the top. 

To cut and fold is to make incisions in the batter 
with the side of the spoon. Turn the mixture very 
carefully upside down (and enfold the air that has 
been stirred or beaten into it) . This is done with a 
spoon by lifting the under part and carefully putting 
it on top. 

Teaspoonfuls and tablespoonf uls are always meas- 
ured rounding, unless specified in the receipt. 

A rounding spoonful is as much over the edge of 
the spoon as in the bowl. 

A heaping spoonful is all the spoon will hold. 

In most of the receipts given in this book ingre- 



10 MEASURING AND MIXING. 

dients are measured inst^^ad of weighed, as it is 
tQuch easier. Below is tb'e table of weights: 

Four cups of flour 1 pound 

Three cups of powdered supfar 1 pound 

Two and one-fourth cups granulated sug-ar 1 pound 

Two cups of butter 1 pound 

Ten eggs, generally 1 pound 

One tablespoonful flour and spices 1 ounce 

One tablespoonful granulated sugar 1 ounce 

One full tablespoon of powdered sugar ... 1 ounce 
One level tablespoon of butter 1 ounce 



HELPFUL HINTS 
AND THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 



To heat cooked food requires a hot oven. 
Cook all starchy food in boiling salted water. 
Frozen vegetables and fruit should be placed in 
cold water. 

Melt butter and mix with crumbs for the tops of 
crumbed dishes. 

When milk has boiled over on the stove, sprinkle 
salt over the place. 

The flavor of one-third lemon and two- thirds 
vanilla is very nice. 

Curdled sauces or custards can be beaten smooth 
with an egg beater. 

Put a pinch of salt in the whites of eggs to make 
them froth quickly. 

Use a glass lemon squeezer for extracting juice 
from lemon and oranges. 

Always add a liquid gradually to a dry material 
to keep it from lumping. 

Wrap lemons and oranges in tissue paper and 
keep in a cool, dry place. 

Dried crumbs absorb more moisture than fresh, 
and are better for watery dishes. 



12 ttKLPFUL HINTS AND THINGS WOBTH KNOWING. 

Soak gelatine always in cold water for some min- 
utes before dissolving in hot water, 

Pistachio flavoring caji be made by using one- 
third almond and two-thirds vanilla. 

Butter and flour cooked together for sauces pre- 
vent a greasy scum from forming on top. 

To chop meat select a cool place and add a little 
flour to prevent it, from sticking together. 

To extract juice from an onion, cut a slice from 
the bottom of the onion and twist it on a grater. 

Cook meringue, or any egg mixture, in a warm 
oven. If cooked in a hot oven, it invariably falls. 

To extract juice from fruit, warm the fruit, press 
through a puree strainer and strain through cheese 
cloth. 

To butter crumbs, melt the butter and to each 
cup of crumbs pour one-third cup of melted butter^ 
and mix with a fork. 

To chop parsley, wash, dry in a towel, pull from 
the stem, gather together compactly and cut through ; 
continue this until it is cut. 

Work fresh butter well, so that it will be entirely 
free from milk; pack in stone jars in layers, cover 
each layer with three inches of coarse salt. 

In thickening a hot liquid, mix the corn starch, 
flour or arrow root with a little cold water or milk 
and pour slowly into the hot mixture, stirring con- 
stantly. 



HELPFUL HINTS AND THINGS WORTH KNOWING. 13 

To scald milk, put it in a vessel and set the 
vessel in boiling water (a double boiler is good for 
this) . When the milk has little beads around the 
edge it is scalded. 

To blanche almonds, pour boiling water over 
shelled almonds, let stand until the skins are loosened 
from the almond, pour off the hot water, cover with 
cold water and slip off the skins, dry between towels. 

In making cakes, meringues or any dish where 
you do not need the yolks of eggs, drop the yolks, as 
you break the eggs into a vessel of hot water. Set 
on the back of the stove until they are cooked. You 
can then use them for garnishing salads and soups. 

To make a pastry bag, one-third of a yard of 
rubber cloth of medium width will make three bags 
by folding it so they will be triangular in shape. 
Stitch together and cut an opening in the end to suit 
the size of tube you want to use. The tubes are 
bought from a kitchen furnishing store. 



MISCELLANEOUS. 



Ammonia removes stains from marble. 

Use a little ammonia in hot water to wash silver 

Wash brushes in ammonia water. Soap and soda 
soften them. 

Use ammonia in cleaning brass, and coal oil in 
cleaning nickel. 

Use ammonia in water instead of soap to wash 
windows. Wipe with a soft cloth and polish with 
chamois skin or paper. 

Wash mattings in salt water and rub dry with a 
cloth. 

To wash a carpet use H. & H. soap, shaved inta 
the water. Rub with a scrubbing brush and wipe- 
with dry cloths. 

Dish cloths should be scalded and washed daily. 

To wash lace curtains, cut in shavings Ivory soap 
in enough cold water to cover one pair of curtains, 
allowing one-half bar to one pair of curtains, and 
one tablespoonf ul of coal oil to each pair. Put them 
on the stove and let them stand two hours. Wash 
out lightly in warm water, rinse in cold thin starch, 
und put them in the stretchers. 

14 



MISCELLANEOUS. 15 

To set color, a teaspoon of turpentine and one of 
ammonia to one gallon of water. 

To set blue in wash goods, one cup of salt dis- 
solved in two gallons of boiling water, Lay the 
goods in until the water cools, then wash it in light 
soap suds. 

To remove ink stains, use Sapolio. To remove 
grass stain, wash in alcohol. 

To remove iron rust, rub the spot with lemon 
juice, cover with salt, let stand in the sun several 
hours. 

To remove fruit stains, stretch the piece over 
a vessel and pour boiling water, in a small stream 
from a distance of two or three feet, over the stained 
surface. 

Mix your polish with weak alum water to make 
your stove look well and to keep it bright. 

Rub lard on a fresh bruise; a little soda and 
water on a sting or burn, and turpentine on a cut. 
Wrap with a cloth to exclude the air. 



SOUPS. 



Soups are divided into two classes — soups with 
stock and soups without stock. While beef forms 
the foundation- of brown soup stock, bits of ham, 
bacon and veal can be used; also the carcasses of 
fowls and chop bones. Meat, bone and fat are all 
necessary in making good soup. 

White stock is made exactly as the brown, using 
fowls, fish or any light colored meat. Avoid season- 
ing with anything that would make the stock dark. 

The meat should be cut from the bone in one 
inch cubes and should stand in cold water from one- 
half to one hour in order to extract the juices. Then 
heat slowly, and when it gets to the simmering point, 
keep it there for four or five hours, never allowing it 
to boil. There are a few things necessary for mak- 
ing stocks, but if carried out one will have no 
trouble in securing good results. 

To Clarify Stock — To every quart of stock allow 
the whites of one egg slightly beaten. Heat together 
and boil up once. Set on the back of the stove ten 
minutes, skim off the egg and scum, and strain. 

Brown Soup Stock. 

Seven pounds of beef, three quarts of cold water, 
six pepper coma, six cloves, one bay leaf, one tea- 



SOUPS. 11 

spoonful of thyme, one teaspooriful marjoram, one 
sprig of parsley, two cups of chopped vegetables, 
two teaspoonfuls of salt. Cut the meat in one inch 
cubes, put two-thirds of it in a kettle with three 
quarts of cold water, let it stand for an hour, put the 
one-third of meat in a skillet with some of the trim- 
mings and marrow from the bones, brown and add to 
the stock. Let it simmer four or five hours, then 
add the seasonings and vegetables and simmer one 
hour, then strain. When cold, the grease will rise 
to the" top and form a thick cake. This you take off 
when ready for use, and the stock forms a jelly-like 
substance. 

White Soup Stock. 

Cut a large, grown chicken into pieces and cover 
with cold water. Add one teaspoonful of salt and 
let simmer for several hours, or until perfectly cooked. 
Then add one-fourth cup of chopped celery, one 
blade of parsley, a small onion, a tiny bit of mace, 
and let it simmer one-half hour longer. Strain, and 
it is ready for use. 

The fowl can be removed when the vegetables are 
put in and can be used for salad, hash, creamed 
chicken, or any mixture where the chicken is to be 
chopped or ground. 

Compound Stock. 

Use a beef bone, a knuckle of veal, the legs and 
wings of fowls, a small onion, some chopped carrot 



18 SOUPS. 

and celery, one-half dozen cloves and pepper corns, 
one teaspoonful of salt. Let this simmer four or 
five hours and strain. 

One can use scraps of bones from fowls, beef, . 
mutton or veal, pieces of meat left over and vegetables, 
cover with cold water and simmer several hours and 
make what is called "Mixed Stock." 

Have a stock pot always ready for receiving such 
left-overs, and nothing need be wasted and good 
stock can always be on hand. 

Bouillon. 

Brown soup stock, clarified, served in bouillon 
cups. 

Consomme. 

Clarify compound stock and you have consomme. 

Black Bean Soup. 

Soak one pint of turtle beans iti one quart of cold 
water over night. Cook two hours in four cups of 
boiling water. Press through a sieve and add the pulp 
to one quart of hot stock and let it cook until thor- 
oughly heated, stirring all the time to blend well. 
Put into the tureen slices of lemon and hard boiled 
eggs. Season the soup with salt and psppcr, pour it 
over the eggs and lemon into the tureen and serve. 
One half cup of wine can be added, if desired. 



SOUPS. 19 

Pea Soup. 

Drain the liquor from a can of peas and add to 
the peas three cups of cold water and cook twenty- 
minutes. Press through a sieve, melt two tablespoons 
of butter and stir into it two tablespoons of flour. 
Pour into this two cups of stock, add the strained 
peas, season with salt and pepper and serve. 

Fea Soup, No. 2. 

Drain the liquor from a can of peas and add three- 
fourths of a cup of water, one sprig of parsley, a bit 
of bay leaf, a slice of onion, cook twenty minutes 
and strain. Melt one tablespoon of butter, stir into 
it one tablespoon of flour, add three cups of stock, 
combine the two mixtures, season with pepper and 
salt, sprinkle croutons over the top and serve. 

Croutons are bits of toasted or fried bread. 

Macaroni Soup. 

Break macaroni or spaghetti into small bits and 
cook in boiling salted water, drain off the water and 
to each cup of macaroni add three cups of heated 
stock. Season with salt and pepper. 

Julienne Soup. 

Cook vegetables cut into dice in boiling salted 
water. Heat the stock, pour off the water from the 
vegetables, add them to the stock, season and serve. 



20 SOUPS. 

Tomato Puree. 

Cook. one can of tomatoes with a .slice of onion, 
one sprig of parsley and a bit of bay leaf, ten min- 
utes, then strain. Melt two tablespoons of butter, 
add two tablespoons of flour, one cup of hot stock and 
one cup of hot water and add the whole to the strained 
tomato. Season with salt and pepper and chopped 
parsley. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Cook two cups of chopped tomatoes, one cup of 
okra cut into small pieces for twenty minutes. Add 
one cup of Irish potatoes cut into dice, one cup of 
corn cut from the cob, and one slice of onion, and cook 
all together until the vegetables are tender. Heat 
one quart of stock and add the vegetables. Season 
and serve. If it is not thick enough, add a little cold 
water to one full tablespoon of corn starch or two of 
flour and pour into the soup, stirring all the time, and 
let it cook until it thickens. 

Chicken Gumbo. 

Cut a chicken for frying and fry out several slices 
of bacon. Remove the bacon, dredge the chicken 
with flour and sauto it in the bacon grease. Put two 
quarts of cold water into the soup kettle with a cup 
of okra sliced, two cups of tomatoes, one-half cup of 
corn, one cup of Irish potatoes cut into cubes, and 
one small onion. Boil all together until done. Pour 
one quart of boiling water o-o-er the chicken and boil 



SOUPS. 21 

until the meat falls from the bones. Remove the 
chicken, chop it fine and add the water in which it 
was cooked and the chopped chicken to the vegeta- 
bles. Thicken, season and serve.

To four cups of white stock add one-half cup of 
chopped celery and one teaspoon of chopped onion. 
Simmer fifteen minutes, add one-half cup of hot 
boiled rice, and season to taste. 

Lenten Soup. 

To two cups of mashed Irish potatoes add four 
cups of white stock or water. Cook one-fourth cup 
each of carrot and turnip, and one one-half cup of 
celery in two tablespoons of butter. Press through 
a sieve, add to the soup, and season with pepper, salt 
and chopped parsley. 

Macedoine Soup. 

Line the bottom of the soup kettle with thin slices 
of ham, cut up three medium-sized Irish potatoes, 
two turnips and one onion and put them in the pot

22 SOUPS. 

let simmer for three-fourths of an hour. Press 
through a sieve. Return to the kettle and add one 
pint of cream. Season with salt and pepper. 

Wine Soup. 

Beat the yolks of six eggs and the whites of 
three together until very light. Add three table- 
spoons of sugar, one tablespoon of lemon juice, the 
grated peel of one lemon and two cups of wine. Set 
on the stove and whip with a wire whip until it 
reaches the boiling point. Serve at once with lady 
fingers or bread sticks. 

Wine of Sago Soup. 

Heat three pints of consomme. Cook one-third 
of a cup of sago in boiling water, drain and add to 
the consomme with one-half cup of sherry wine. 

Tomato Bisque. 
Cook one can of tomatoes and one slice of onion to- 
gether and strain. Melt two tablespoons of butter aud 
stir in two tablespoons of flour. Pour on this two cups 
of light cream. Cook until it thickens. Add a pinch 
of soda to the strained tomatoes and then pour on 
the thickened cream. Season and serve at once. 

Oyster Bisque. 

Melt two tablespoons of butter. Add two full table- 
spoons of flour and three cups of fresh milk ; cook until 
it thickens. Drain a pint of oysters. Scald, by putting 



SOUPS. 23 

them in a double boiler. When tlio edges curl, chop 
them fine and add them to the bisque with one cup 
of hot cream. Season with salt and white pepper. 
Bisque of clams can be made in the same way as the 
oyster bisque. 

Cream of Oyster. 

The same as oyster bisque, except you use the 
oysters whole and use one cup of liquor and two of 
milk. 

Cream of Asparagus. 

Cook one can of Asparagus in one pint of water 
ten or fifteen minutes. Press through a sieve and 
reserve one-half cup of the tips. Melt two table- 
spoons of butter. Add two tablespoons of flour and 
two cups of milk. Pour this over the strained aspar- 
agus, cook together a minute or two to blend, then 
add one cup of hot cream and the tips. Season with 
salt and white pepper. 

Cream of Celery. 

Cream of celery is made in the same way, using 
two cups of chopped celery and a piece of celery 
root, and cooking it until tender enough to extract 
the juice. Or it can bo made entirely from the root. 

All cream soups are made very much this way, 
using more or less of the vegetable from which you 
make the soup, according to the flavor. 

Cook ^6 vegetables in a small quantity of water. 
Press through a sieve. To one cup of vegetable pulp 



add three cups of milk or cream. Bind always with 
butter and flour or corn starch cooked together. The 
easiest and best way is while the vegetables are cook- 
ing, to cook the butter and flour together, add the 
cream or milk, pour it over the vegetable pulp, return 
to the fire just a moment, season and serve. If you 
wish to add to the richness of the soup, you can add 
the yolk of an egg beaten and poured in very grad- 
ually just before serving. 



GARNISHES FOR SOUPS. 



Force Meat. 

Grrind. or chop - fine the meat you want to use,, 
chicken, fish, clams or oysters. Add white of an egg 
and work until smooth, then add a little cream until 
of the consistency to shape. Season, roll into little 
balls and poach in boiling water. 

Croutons. 

Croutons are small, fancifully cut shapes of light 
bread, fried or toasted and sprinkled over the soup 
just before serving. 

Breadsticks. 

Make a beaten biscuit dough. Roll thin and cut 
in strips one inch wide and four or five long, with a 
pie jagger. Bake and arrange on a plate like a log 
cabin or cut light bread into strips one-half inch 
wide, four or five inches long, and toast. 

Noodles. 

Make a dough of one egg slightly beaten, one-half 
teaspoon of salt and flour enough to make it stifE. 



26 GARNISHES FOR SOUPS 

Roll thin, cut in fine strips or fancy shapes. Cook 
them in boiling water fifteen or twenty minutes, drain 
and add to the soup. 

Yolks of hard boiled eggs, sliced, and lemons sliced 
very thin, are used as garnishes. 

Caramel for Coloring and Flavoring Soup. 

Put one cup of granulated sugar on the stove and 
when it has melted and browned (but not burned J 
pour in one cup of hot water„ Let it cook slowly a 
few minutes. 



FISH. 

To get the best flavor of fish it sliould be eaten 
fresli and in season. You can determine the fresh- 
ness by the firmness of its flesli, and the eyes and 
gills should be bright. If the fish is frozen, thaw it by 
putting it in cold water a short time before cooking. 

Cream Sauce. 

As there are so many fish dishes made with a 
cream sauce and its variations', I will give the formula 
and the way of preparing at the beginning: 

One tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of flour, 
one cup of milk or cream> season with salt and pep- 
per. Put the butter in a sauce pan and cook until it 
bubbles, then put in the flour and stir a few minutes; 
add the milk and cook, stirring all the while, until it 
thickens to the consistency of heavy cream. You 
can use stock instead of milk, or half and half. 
Sometimes the yolk of egg is added just before serv- 
ing, and many seasonings, such as chopped parsley, 
grated nutmeg, chopped mushrooms, sweetbreads and 
oysters. 

Stuffing for Fish. 

Mix one cup of dry bread crumbs with sufficient 
melted butter to moisten. Add a little chopped 
onion, celery and parsley, pepper and salt. 

' ' 27 " 



28 FISH. 

Bread Stuffing. 

Pour one cup of boiling water over one cup of 
crumbs. Add a small lump of butter, a little chop- 
ped onion, celery and parsley, pepper and salt. One 
egg, beaten lightly is sometimes added. 

To Boil Fish. 

Cover the fish with hot, but not boiling, water, as 
the boiling water tears the skin and disfigures the 
fish. Add one teaspoon of vinegar and one table- 
spoon of salt to each two quarts of water. The vin- 
egar and salt bleaches and hardens and seasons the 
fish as well. Boil gently, allowing ten or twelve 
minutes to the pound. If you haven't a fish kettle, 
put the fish in a cloth, having the ends long enough 
on either side to lift it out with. When done, lift it 
out and serve with drawn butter or egg sauce, or 
holandaise sauce is also nice to serve it with, Always 
a little garnish of green gives attractiveness to the 
dish, and there is no better appetizer than the eye. 

Court Bouillon. 

Out fine one carrot, one onion, a stalk of celery, 
and cook them in a little butter. Add a sprig of 
parsley, one-half dozen pepper cones and three or 
four cloves. Pour over this two quarts of hot water 
and one cup of wine or ono-half cup of vinegar. 
Let it boil ten or fifteen minutes, skim and pour over 
the fish, which has been rubbed with lemon and salt. 



FISH. 29 

Cook gently until tender in a cooking pan covered 
over. Serve with sauce. The stock in which this 
fish was cooked can be used several times. 

Baked Fish. 

Stuff a fish weighing three or four pounds with 
bread stuffiing, thread a trussing needle with twine 
and sew it together, beginning at the head and tak- 
ing a few stitches down. To hold the dressing 
securely in, wrap the string several times around the 
tail. Out gashes, two or three on each side of the 
fish, and lay pieces of bacon in these gashes. Shape 
the fish with skewers into the shape of the letter S. 
Put several pieces of bacon on the fish sheet. Rub 
the fish over with butter, salt and pepper. Dredge 
with flour. Place the fish on the sheet, bake in a 
moderate oven, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound; 
baste often with butter and water. Garnish with 
lemon and parsley and serve with a cream sauce, or 
with parisienne potatoes and cream sauce. 

Broiled Fish. 

To broil a fish in the oven, split the fish and lay it 
skin side down on oiled paper in a baking pan. Sea- 
son with salt, pepper and butter, and dredge with flour. 
Cook on the upper grate of a hot oven. When done, 
season with melted butter and chopped parsley; serve. 

Fish cm Gratin. 

Make a cream sauce by cooking one tablespoon of 
butter, one tablespoon of flour and one cup of milk

together until it thickens. Skin and bone a three- 
pound fish, cut into pieces an inch or two long. 
Arrange in a baking dish. Pour over it a half cup 
of wine. Season with a little red pepper and salt. 
Pour the cream sauce over it, spread the top with 
buttered crumbs and bake. 

Fish a la Creme. 

Make a cream sauce as for Fish au Gratin. Boil 
a fish until tender. When cold, loose from the bones 
and pull into small pieces. Put a layer of fish in a 
baking pan with bits of butter, salt and cayenne 
pepper, then a layer of cream sauce, and so on until 
the pan is filled. Put around the dish triangular 
pieces of light bread and bake in the oven long 
enough to toast the bread. You can garnish the 
center of the dish with hard boiled eggs cut in fancy 
shapes. 

Molded Fish With Parisienne Potatoes or Potato- 
Border. 

Grind a cold, boiled fish, after the bones have 
been removed, in a meat grinder. To every pint of 
fish pulp add one-half cup of cream sauce and two 
unbeaten eggs, a little chopped onion, salt and pep- 
per. Boat the mixture as you would a batter. Grease- 
with butter or oil, a border mold (a round mold with 
a large opening in the center) , press the creamed fish 
into it, set the tin mold in a pan of hot water and 
cover with greased paper or a close-fitting top and

tjook inside the oven until it is firm to the touch. 
Turn on a hot platter and fill the center with Parisi- 
enne potatoes. Serve with a cream sauce, and gar- 
nish with parsley. Or, you can cook in any shaped 
pan or mold in the same manner and serve with 
seasoned mashed Irish potatoes, with the yellow of 
one egg added to hold in shape and pressed through 
a star-shaped tube to form a wavy border around the 
dish. Set inside the stove a moment to brown. 

Parisienne Potatoes. 

Peel Irish Potatoes and use a French potato cut- 
ter (which you can buy at the kitchen furnishing 
stores) and cut into little balls enough potatoes to fill 
the center of the mold. Let them stand in cold water 
for a while and then boil for ten or fifteen minutes in 
salted water. Pour off the water, sprinkle with a 
little salt to absorb all moisture, pour into the center 
of the creamed fish. Serve with cream sauce. 

Fish Timhalls. 

Use the mixture for molded fish, but cook in indi- 
vidual molds, round or any shape. Cook in the same 
way. Serve as a fish course with Parisienne potatoes 
and parsley sauce, or you can line each mold with 
small rings of boiled macaroni or spaghetti cooked in 
long sticks and wound around the greased moulds. 
Then put in the fish mixture, cook in the same way 
and serve with a cream sauce. 



32 PISH. 

Fried Fish,

it is quite hot, put in the fish. Cook on one side, turn 
and cook the other. 

Salt Mackerel. 

Soak the fish over night and the next morning 
change the water and soak again a short time. Stew 
for fifteen minutes in water enough to cover it with 
one teaspoon of vinegar. When done serve on a hot

SHELL FISH. 



OYSTERS. 



Oysters on the Half Shell. 

Place several oysters on deep half shell. Put 
them on a plate of crushed ice with a slice or a quar- 
ter of lemon to each person. Serve peppsr and salt 
and wafers with raw oysters. It is very pretty to fill 
the shell with lemon points and a little jjarsley. 

Oyster Cocktail. 

Put blue points, one-half dozen to each person, 
in slender glass tumblers half filled with crushed ice. 
Pour over each tumbler a sauce made of three table- 
spoons of tomato catsup, one tablespoon of lemon 
juice, one tablespoon of strained tomato juice, one- 
half teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, one drop of 
Tobasco sauce. 

Panned Oysters. 

Put two tablespoons of butter in a skillet. When 
melted, put in as many oysters, that have been 
drained and washed, as will cover the bottom of the 
skillet. Dust with poxjper and salt. Cook until the 
edges curl and serve on buttered toast. 



SHELLED FISH. 35 

Deviled Oysters. 
These are the same as panned oysters. The only 
difference is, that just before serving, you should 
sprinkle them with red* pepper and add one table- 
spoon of Worcestershire sauce. They are both nice 
chafing dish receipts. 

Scalloped Oysters. 

Wash and drain one pint of oysters. Reserve 
the liquors. Pour one half cup of liquor and one 
half cup of cream or wino over one full cup of bread 
crumbs. Beat the butter into this. Put a layer in 
the bottom of the baking dish, cover with oysters, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, and so on until you 
have two layers of oysters. Sprinkle the top with 
buttered crumbs and cook in the oven twenty or 
thirty minutes. 

Scalloped Oysters, No. 2. 

Put a layer of crumbs in the bottom of a shallow 
baking dish, then a layer of oysters that have been 
drained from the liquor. Sprinkle with pepper and 
salt, dot over with little bits of butter. Repeat this 
until the pan is full. Pour over this enough liquor 
to moisten,, sprinkle buttered crumbs over the top 
and bake twenty or thirty minutes. 

Broiled Oysters. 

Drain and pick over nice, large oysters. Wipe 
them dry, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dip in 



36 SHELLED FISH. 

melted butter. Have a clean, hot skillet and lay the 
oysters on it close together, until the bottom is cov- 
ered. Then begin to turn the ones first put in. By 
the time you have finished turning them they will be 
ready to serve. Pour melted butter over them. 

Oysters a la France. 

Scald one pint of oysters in their own liquor. 
Make a sauce of two tablespoons of butter and two of 
flour. Cook together, then add the oyster liquor and 
cook until smooth. Then add one cup of cream, a 
little salt and a little red and white pepper. Draw 
to the back of the stove and stir in slowly the beaten 
yolks of two eggs and a dash of nutmeg. Put 
pieces of toast in the bottom of the dish and pour 
the mixture over it. This should not be made until 
ready to serve. Add oysters after nutmeg. 

Fried Oysters. 

Drain and pour cold water over the oysters. W:.p© 
them dry and flatten with the hand. Sprinkle with pep- 
per and salt, dip in crumbs and the yolk of egg (diluted

tablespoon of btitter. Add one tablespoon of flour, 
throo-fourths of a cup of cream and cook until it 
thickens a little. Add one pint of oysters that have 
boon drained and season with salt and pepper. Just 
before serving, add the yolk of one egg very slowly. 
This is a nice mixture for pastry cups or patty-shells. 
Tou can leave out the egg if you choose. 

Clams. 

Little neck clams are served raw as oysters and 
when the oyster is out of season. 

Boiled Clams. 

Wash the clams very carefully and put them in a 
pot over a hot fire with very little v/ater in order to 
save their juices. When they open lift out the shell 
and remove the clams and return, them to the water. 
Add butter, pepper and salt and boil ten minutes. 
Serve hot. 

Broiled Clams. 

Select large clams and broil as oysters. 

Crabs. 
Crabs must be put on the lire in cold water. If 
put into hot water they shoot their claws which spoil

them. Heat gradually and boil one-half hour. Put 
into a dish, face downwards, to dry. 

Deviled Crab. 

Open boiled crabs by raising the body from the 
Bhell without breaking the shell. Remove the gills 
and other uneatable parts. Pick the white meat from 
the claws and body. Do the same with what is good 
of the inside, namely, the white and yellow curd and 
the coral. Chop them fine, season with oil or butter, 
vinegar, mustard or pepper. Clean the shell well 
and serve the mixture in the shell. Garnish with 
parsley. Serve with thin slices of bread and butter. 

Deviled Crab (Served Hot.)

pan and heat. Place them in the shell and sprinkle 
the top with buttered crumbs. Put in the oven and 
brown. 

Lobster. 

To boil lobster, tie the claws of the lobster together. 
Put it head first into the hot salt water for fifteen or 
twenty minutes or longer if the size requires. After 
it is cold break off the tail, then the claws, and remove 
the body from the shell. Remove the stomach which 
lies under the head, and also the gills. Break open 
the body and take the small pieces of meat that lie 
under the gills. Break the claws and remove the 
meat. Cut the membrane on the inside of the tail 



SHELLED FISH. 3^ 

and take the meat out in one piece and open it to 
remove the intestine that runs the length of the tail 
piece. 

Broiled Lobster. 

After the lobster has been boiled, split it length- 
wise. Take out all uneatable parts. Open it out flat, 
sprinkle with pepper and put a piece of butter on 
each side. Cook over coals or in a hot oven. Serve 
in the shells with a parsley garnish. You prepare 
lobster stewed, creamed or scalloped in the same 
manner as for fish or oysters. 

Lobster a la Newberg. 

Pick all the meat from the lobster and cut into 
inch pieces, cook it in one tablespoon of butter, a 
pinch of salt, a little red pepper, cook for five min- 
utes and add a third of a cup of wine. Beat the 
yolks of two eggs light, add one-third of a cup of 
cream, pour this over the lobster, cook for two min- 
utes, gently stirring. 



MEATS. 



BEEF. 

In order to shut in the juice you expose the sur- 
face of the meat to a great heat by putting the meat 
in a hot pan on the top of the range, pressing it down 
close and turning on every side until well seared, 
then put it inside the oven and cook with moderate 
heat. Slow cooking breaks the fiber of meat and 
renders it more tender. This principle holds good in 
boiling, baking and broiling. Meat with very little 
fat is much improved by larding. 

Roast Beef. 

Wipe the roast with a piece of wet cheese cloth. 
Do not wash, as water draws out the juices. Dredge 
with flour, put into a pan on top of the stove and 
sear all sides. Then place inside of the oven and 
cook, allowing eight to twelve minutes to the pound, 
according as you like it rare or well done. Put a little 
pepper and salt in one corner of the pan and some 
drippings, or three or four pieces of bacon. Baste 
every ten or twelve minutes. Larded beef is cooked 
in the same way, but before cooking insert lardons 

40 



MEATS. 41 

of salt pork over the top and at the sides. If you 
like, you may insert them at regular intervals, making 
a most attractive appearance. Serve roast beef with 
Irish potatoes, left whole or cut in fancy shapes and 
cooked with the meat. There arc many ways of shaping 
the potatoes. A very pretty way is to peal them and 
cut one-fourth inch slices -crossways, cutting almost 
through. If the slices should fall apart, stick a 
wooden toothpick through them. Cook them with 
the roast, basting often. Pull out the skewers or 
toothpicks and arrange around the roast with little 
pieces of parsley, 

Braised Beef. 
Cover the bottom of a braising pan with chopped 
vegetables, mixed with a little stock or water. Place 
a piece of beef, dredged with flour, and weighing 
from four to six pounds, on top of the vegetables. 
Place in a hot oven for fifteen or twenty minutes. 
Cover the top of the beef with chopped vegetables 
(carrots, turnips, onions and celery) . Cover the 
whole with two cupfuls of stock or water. Add a 
little parsley, six whole peppers, four or five cloves, 
a bit of bay leaf and a little salt. Cover it closely, 
so that the steam can not escape, and cook very 
slowly for three or four hours. 

Beef a-la-mode. 
Cut out the bone from a round of beef. Wipe 
with a wet cloth. Fill the cavity where the bone 
was taken out with a dressing made of buttered 



42 MEATS. 

bread crumbs seasoned with pepper, salt and onions. 
Make deep incisions in the beef with a knife. Cut 
thin strips of salt pork, dip them in a seasoning made 
of a teaspoon each of salt, pepper, cloves and a little 
nutmeg. Dip the strips of pork in this and insert 
them in the cuts. Put the remainder of the spices 
over the top. Cover over- the top with thin strips of 
pork and tie in shape. Cover with two quarts of 
water and cook in the oven for four hours. Baste 
frequently with butter and water with a little flour. 
When done, skim off the fat. Thicken the gravy 
and season with wine. 

Fillet of Beef. 

The fillet is the under side of the loin of beef ^ 
it is covered with skin and fat. This must be 
removed from the top. Your butcher will cut it for 
you according to direction. Lard over the top, put. 
pieces of salt pork in the bottom of a baking dish, 
lay the fillet on, baste with water and butter, with 
pepper and salt or beef drippings. Cook thirty min- 
utes. Serve with mushroom sauce. Fillet of beef 
can be braised and the garnishes are many — truffles,, 
livers, olives, etc., all cooked in wine. 

Beef or Veal Loaf. 

Grind three pounds of the meat. Mix it with one- 
cup of breadcrumbs, one cup of mashed Irish potatoes^ 
a tablespoon of butter, a little chopped parsley arid 
pepper and salt to taste. Shape into a round or 



MEATS. 43 

oblong loaf. Put into a baking pan with one pint 
of water. Baste frequently and bake two and one- 
half hours. This can be served cold or hot. 

Broiled Beefsteak. 

Select a steak from one to one and a half inches 
thick. If sirloin is used, cut the flank end off and 
grind for Hamburg steak. Have the broiler or 
griddle very hot. Piit on the steak, turn at once, 
and sear on both sides. Turn several times while 
cooking. Have some butter in the platter and put 
it where the dish will keep warm and the butter 
will melt. When the steak is as done as you like, 
sprinkle with pepper and salt, lay it on the platter 
and turn it bo that it will get the seasoning of but- 
ter. Garnish with parsley or serve with Saratoga 
potatoes. There are many ways of serving steak 
which give a different taste and appearance to the 
same broiled steak: Use mushrooms cooked in a 
cream or brown sauce, pour this over the steak or 
serve in a sauce bowl; tomato sauce is used; lemons 
are cut in quarters or crescents and used as a garnish 
with parsley; water-cress is appetizing, easy and 
always acceptable. Beefsteak and onions are popu- 
lar; fry or saute the onions in butter and spread over 
the steak, serve in a brown sauce with the steak. 

Broiled Steak With Oysters. 

Broil your steak in the same manner as in the 
above receipt, and just before it is done cover the

top with oysters and place inside of the oven long 
enough to curl the edges of the oysters, sprinkle with 
pepper and salt and serve at once. 

Hamburg Steak. 
Grind lean beef, season with a little onion, pepper 
and salt. E,oll into a flat mound about an inch thick. 
Put it on a very hot griddle, turn it when done and 
pour over it melted butter. Or you can make it into 
little cakes and broil. 

Hamburg Steak, No. 2. 
Grind the meat, season with onion, pepper and 
salt. Mix with one or two unbeaten eggs, shape as 
cutlets, dip in crumbs, saute in hot butter, and serve 
around a mound of, boiled Irish potatoes pressed 
through a ricer. A ricer is a potato press that 
makes the potato, when pressed through, very light 
and ornamental, resembling little curls. 

Beef Hash. 
Cut cold beef into small bits. Put it into a skil- 
let with water or stock enough to cover and a little 
onion. When thoroughly heated, mix one table- 
spoon of flour with a cup of cream or stock and 
pour into the hash and when it has cooked long 
enough to thicken, season with salt and pepper. 

Beef Hash, No. 2. 
Out cold beef into small pieces, pour over enough 
brown stock to cover well; cook ten or fifteen min- 



MEATS. 45 

utes, season with one tablespooo of butter, pepper

thicken with a little brown flour and butter cooked 
together. 

Beef Tongue {Cured). 

Soak it over night in cold water. Put it to cook 
the next morning in cold water with a slice of lemon, 
a little vinegar, four or five cloves and six pepper 
corns. Cook several hours. Let it cool in the water.

Fresh Beef Tongue. 

Soak over night in cold water. Cook in boiling 
water with a tablespoon of lemon juice and a table- 
spoon of vinegar, four or five cloves and six pepper 
corns and a little salt. Cook until tender, leave in 
the water until cold. Skin and serve in thin slices. 
One-half cup of wine can be added to the water in 
place of the vinegar. 

Frizzled Beef. 

Use dried beef, cut very thin or shaved. You 
can get it put up in cans, which is preferable to the 
other, as it is shaved and ready for use. Put a lump 
of butter in the skillet, when hot put in the slices of 
beef. Stir it well, and when thoroughly heated it is 
ready. Pour the butter over it and serve. 

Saddle of Mutton. 
Remove the skin from the top. Wipe it off with 
a cloth dipped in water with one teaspoon of soda

dissolved in it, and then wipe it dry. Make incis- 
ions in the meat and fill with a dressing made hy 
mixing one-half cup of bread crumbs, one table- 
spoon of brown sugar, one tablespoon of butter, a 
little chopped celery, one teaspoon of allspice, a lit- 
tle salt and pepper. Put over the surface of the 
meat with brown sugar, cayenne pepper, a little salt 
and soda and nutmeg. Roast four hours and serve 
with sauce. Baste of ten with butter and water. 

Roast Leg of Mutton. 

Chop ofE the knuckle bone. Remove the thick 
skin. Sprinkle it with pepper and dredge with flour. 
Place in a baking pan with a little salt water. Baste 
frequently and cook until done, allowing twenty 
minutes to the pound. Serve with the gravy made 
from the bastings. Dress the top with currant jelly. 

Crown Roast. 

This is made from the full loin. Split the bones 
between the chops. Take off all the meat on the 
bones down to a certain point, leaving the shape of 
French chops. Tie or skewer the roast together, 
turning it backwards into a crown or circle. Wrap 
each bojie with greased letter paper so it will not 
burn while cooking. Bake it, basting frequently 
with stock or water and butter. Pill the center with 
cooked potatoes and carrots, cut into balls, or Saratoga 
chips.

Breaded Chops {Sauted). 

Prepare as for broiling. Dip them in egg and 
then in crumbs. Have a tablespoon of drippings or 
butter in the saute pan. Cook three or four minutes 
on one side, then turn and cook the other. Serve 
with a tomato sauce and garnish with parsley. 

Lamb. 

Cook lamb as you do mutton, only, cook it more 
thoroughly, as it should always be well done. It is 
served with green peas, asparagus and mint sauce.

Like lamb, veal should be thoroughly cooked, 
and use the receipt for roasting and baking lamb for 
roasting and baking veal. 

Veal Cutlets. 
These can be either broiled, sauted or fried, as 
you would for lamb or mutton.

To Boil a Ham. 

Wash the ham well and put it to soak over night. 
Put it on in cold water and let it come to the boiling 
point, then simmer five or six hours, or until the 
bone in the end can be removed. Let it cool in 
ihe water. Remove the skin and rub the top with 
bread crumbs and brown sugar, or dress with dots of 
pepper and cloves. Put in the oven a few minutes

water for an hour or two. Wipe dry and place in 
the broiler and broil over coals or in a very hot 
griddle. 

Ham and Eggs. 

When a boiled or baked ham is about used up, 
cut all the meat from the bono and grind it or shred. 
Put a lump of butter in a skillet. When melted put 
the ham in and break four or five eggs and stir as 
you would for scrambled eggs. Season and serve. 
Or you can" boil one-half dozen eggs hard. Cook 
the grated ham in butter and place in the center of 
a dish. Press the yolks of the eggs through a ricer 
over the top and garnish the outside with the chop- 
ped whites.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



To Pick a Fowl. 

Tou can pick a fowl dry and it is considered 
superior to scalding, but it is much easier and quicker 
to pick them after they have been scalded. Plunge 
the fowl head downward into very hot water and 
repeat several times. Then take the fowl by the legs, 
in the left hand and strip the feathers beginning at 
the legs and going toward the head. Then rub hard 
with a clean cloth to remove the pin feathers. Put 
a little alcohol in a saucer and light it and hold the 
fowl over the blaze. This singes it and makes it per- 
fectly clean and smooth. 

To Draw a Fowl. 

Lay the fowl on its back with the tail toward you. 
Cut a circle through the skin around the vent. Make 
the incisions large enough for two fingers. Carefully 
draw out the coiitentB of the body. Cut the skin the 
length of the neck at the back and loosen the neck 
from the craw. Cut off the neck and remove the craw 
and windpipe being careful not to tear the skin. If 
it is a grown chicken the sinews from the legs can be 

50 



POULTKY AND GAME 5] 

drawn by laying the chicken on its back and cutting 
the skin around the first joint of the leg. Carefully 
turning it backward you will find a bunch of sinews 
on the outside. By putting a skewer under each one, 
holding the fowl securely and pulling from you they 
<5an be drawn and the lower joint of the leg made as 
tender as the upper. 

The liver, gizzard and heart are the giblets. After 
the gizzard is opened and cleaned and the liver and 
heart washed, they can be cooked and cut into small 
pieces and made into sauce and gravies. 

To Bone a Fowl. 

Begin at the neck and make an incision the whole 
length of the back. Out close to the bon© and scrape 
as you go. The wings are difficult to bone, so just 
leave those and break the joint in order to free the 
body. Be very careful in cutting around the breast- 
bone as you are liable to tear the skin. All fowls are 
boned in the same manner. 

To Truss a Fowl. 

Bring the wings over the back having the tips to 
touch each other and press down close and skewer 
Press the legs into shape holding them close to the 
body and run a skewer through the thigh and through 
the body to the other side. Put a string through the 
loop of the skewer that holds the wings and cross to 
the other side and wrap around the end. Then under 
the Wing to the opposite one and fasten to the skewer

that holds the leg and cross to the opposite leg. 
Then tie securely. When it is cooked remove the 
skewers and string.

VEGETABLES. 



Vegetables, if possible, should be cooked when 
perfectly fresh. They should be kept (if necessary 
to keep) in a cool, dry place. Cook all green and 
starchy vegetables in boiling water with a little salt. 
The salt seasons and helps to preserve the color. A 
time-table can not be depended upon, as so much 
depends upon the age and the freshness of the vege- 
ables. Fresh ones take much less time in cooking. 
Study the serving of vegetables with your meats, 
as some seem to harmonize with, certain kinds of 
meats more than others. Two vegetables with a 
course is all that is needed or advisable. 

Boiled Potatoes.

ones. Put in cold water to prevent discolor. If the 
potatoes are wilted, let them stand in ice cold water 
for an hour. Have the potatoes as near the same 
size as possible; cut the larger ones to correspond 
with the smaller. Cook in boiling, salted water from 
twenty to thirty minutes. Drain off all the water 
and sprinkle a little salt to help absorb all moisture. 
Set on the back of stove, cover, leaving just enough 
opening for steam to escape, or cover with a piece of 
cheese cloth. Serve plain, or with a white sauce 
poured over them.

EGGS. 

Eggs are a very nutritious and easily digested food 
■when properly cooked. There are numerous ways of 
preparing them, giving a wonderful variety. 

To Boil an Egg. 

Pour one pint of boiling water over it, cover and 
let stand on back of stove six minutes to soft boil. 
If a larger number is to be boiled, allow one pint of 
water to each egg. Allow twenty minutes to hard 
toil. 

To Saute Eggs. 

Put a tablespoon of butter in the pan; when 
melted, break one egg at a time. Don't have butter 
too hot. If you want egg cooked on both sides, 
turn and cook through. They are very nice served 
with boiled ham or bacon; if served with either of 
these, cook the meat first, put on a platter and keep 
warm and cook the eggs in the same pan in drippings 
from the meat. 

To Poach an Egg. 

Break one egg at a time in a shallow vessel of 
hot water and cook until the white is firm. Lift

until creamy. Season with salt and pepper. 

Ways of Serving Hard Boiled Eggs. 

Take the shells from around hard boiled eggs 
and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve whole in a 
cream sauce, or cut in small pieces, mix in with cream 
sauce and serve on toast. Cut the whites in daisy- 
shaped petals, dip each one in cream sauce, arrange 
around a shallow dish, put a spoonful or two of cream 
sauce in the bottom of the dish and press the yolks 
on to it through a ricer. Chop the whites of eggs 
and mix with a cream sauce, line a dish with toast 
dipped in butter, cover each piece with creamed 
eggs. Season the yolks with a little butter, pepper 
and salt, press through a ricer over the top of dish. 
There are many ways of preparing hard boiled egg» 
as garnishes. 

Dressed Eggs. 

Cut hard boiled eggs in two, crossways or length- 
ways. Season the yolks with butter, pepper, salt, a 
little mustard and vinegar. Roll in balls and place 
a ball in each half of the whites.

chopped parsley, drop an egg into each one. Put 



EGGS. 85 

the molds into a pan of hot water. Cover over the 
top, cook until the whites are set. Turn each one on 
to a round of toast and put a tablespoon of well- 
seasoned cream sauce on each one. 

Baked Eggs with Cheese.

twenty minutes. 

Plain Omelet. 

Four eggs beaten separately until light; add to 
the yolks four tablespoons of milk and one teaspoon 
of baking powder; fold in whites, sprinkle with salt 
and a very little white pepper. Put tablespoon of 
butter in the omelet pan; do not have it too hot; 
pour in the mixture; cut long cuts through the bot- 
tom to get the heat through in order to cook, and 
when it is set, put inside the oven on the grate and 
let brown slightly; fold and turn on hot platter, 
garnish with parsley and serve at once. There 
are many variations to this omelet. It can be 
served with macaroni, cut in pieces and boiled, 
arranged around the omelet and a tomato sauce 
poured over it. By sprinkling the top of omelet 
with parsley, mushrooms, ham, oysters, fruits, jel- 
lies, etc., etc., you have as many different kinds of 
omelet. 



Creamy Omelet. 

Beat together (just enough to break the eggs 
well) four eggs, add four tablespoons of water or 
milk. Melt one tablespoon of butter in an omelet 
pan; when hot, but not brown, pour in the eggs; 
when it is slightly set at the bottom, cut and turn 
the cooked parts on top, letting the uncooked slip to 
the bottom; continue this until it all seems cooked, 
then stand for a moment to set. Tip the omelet pan 
and with a broad-bladed knife or spatula fold and 
turn on a warm platter. Garnish and serve at once.

HOW TO COOK DRIED AND FRESH FRUITS. 



To Cook Fresh Fruit., 

Fresh fruit is generally stewed and should be 
cooked in a granite or porcelain vessel and stirred, 
with a wooden spoon. Tin or iron utensils affect the 
color and flavor. Add a pinch of salt while cooking. 
Stew with a small quantity of water until nearly 
done, then add sugar to suit the taste. Sugar added 
to acid fruit while cooking loses its sweetening quali- 
ties, and it is advisable not to add it until the fruit, 
is almost or entirely done. 

To Stew Apples. 

Pare, core and cut in halves. Put in a stew pan. 
with a small quantity of water. Cover closely and 
stew until tender. Add the sugar and stir in lightly,, 
so that you do not break the apples. More water is. 
necessary to cook some apples than others, and when 
necessary to use a good deal of water, pour it off' 
before adding the sugar. 

To Stew Fears. 

Wash the pears and pare, if preferred. Put a 
small quantity of water, about one cup to six or 
eight medium-sized pears, and one cup of sugar over

them; three or four cloves added to the water is an 
improvement. Cover the vessel well and cook until 
tender. 

To Stew Peaches. 
Pare and seed, cut in halves and cOok as pears. 

To Stew Cranberries. 

Wash one quart of cranberries and add three- 
fourths of a pint of boiling water, cover closely and 
cook, five minutes over a quick fire. Stir with a 
wooden spoon, press through a colander, add three- 
fourths of a pint of sugar. Simmer five minutes. 
Serve hot or cold. When cold, it will jelly. 

To Stew Pie-Plant. 

Wash and scrape, cut in inch long pieces, cover 
with water, heat to the boiling point, drain off the 
water, add two cups of sugar to each quart of pie- 
plant and simmer five minutes. 

To Stew Gooseberries. 

Stem and wash the berries. Cook as pie-plant, 
using the same quantity of sugar. A little more 
time is necessary in stewing the gooseberries than 
pie-plant. 

To Stew Dried Fruits. 

Wash well in warm water. Soak in cold water 
until they lose their shriveled appearance. It is well 
to soak some dried fruit over night. Cook in the 



HOW TO COOK DRIED AND FRESH FRUITS. gQ 

water in which they were soaked until tender; cook 
slowly in a covered vessel. Sweeten, and simmer 
five minutes. Serve hot or cold. 

Prunes should be soaked several hours and cooked 
slowly for one and one-half or two hours. Stew dried 
plums as you do prunes. 

Apricots should be washed in warm water and 
soaked in cold water for several hours and cooked in 
enough water to cover for one hour. Sweeten to 
taste and simmer five minutes. 

To Stew Dried Apples or Peaches. 

Both dried peaches and apples should be washed, 
and soaked over night or several hours. Cook slowly 
in a small quantity of water in a covered vessel. 
Cook until tender. Add sugar, simmer a few min- 
utes and serve hot or cold. 

Baked Pears. 

Use fresh or canned pears; put in a baking dish, 
pour over the syrup from the can, sprinkle with 
sugar, add a little lemon peel and bake for fifteen or 
twenty minutes. If fresh pears are used, stew until 
tender, put in the baking dish, add sugar and water 
and bake 

Baked Peaches and Apricots. 

Peaches and apricots are baked in the same way 
as pears. 



COMPOTES. 



Compotes are fresh fruit stewed in a syrup, and 
can be used as a dessert with cake. A mold of rice 
is often garnished and served with compotes. 

Syrup for Cooking Compotes. 

Two cups of sugar and two cups of water, boil 
five minutes after it reaches the boiling point, put in 
the fruit and cook until tender. 

Apple, Pear, Peach and Apricot Compote. 

Pare and core the apples, cut in halves or quar- 
ters. Drop them in the syrup and cook until tender ;. 
lift out with a perforated skimmer. Cook the syrup- 
down and pour over the apples. Pears are cooked in 
the same way. Peaches and apricots are pared and 
stoned, cut in halves and cooked in the syrup as the- 
apples and pears. 

Orange Compote. 

Peel the oranges down to the pulp, cut in two,, 
crosswise, and cut out the core or break in sections. 
Take off the thin skin, add a little lemon juice to the 
syrup, drop in the orange pieces and cook until ten- 
der. Remove and cook the syrup down and pour 
over the oranges. Serve with whipped cream.

BREADS. 



Since bread forms so large a part of the daily 
diet, it is very important that it should be good bread. 
It is a mistake to think it difficult to make; it is easy 
when the principles are understood. It is necessary 
to have good flour. You can not make good bread 
with new wheat flour. It should be at least three 
months old. You can dry flour by spreading a small 
quantity in the sun or putting it near a fire, but this 
is troublesome. The proportions of raising materials 
are given below, and directions and explanations for 
mixing and baking. Carry them out and see what 
you can do in bread making. Of course it takes 
some experience in mixing and baking, but you can 
get this in a few times making. 

Proportions. 

Use one level teaspoon of baking powder to each 
cup of flour. 

Use one level teaspoon of soda and two full tea- 
spoons of cream of tartar to one quart of flour. 

Use one level teaspoon of soda to one pint of 
sour or butter milk. 

Corn and batter breads should be made with 
fresh sour milk. Biscuits are better when the milk is 
a little more acid. 



92 BREADS. 

Use about three and one-half cups of flour to one 
pint of liquid in yeast bread, rolls or loaf bread. 

Use three-fourths cup of liquid to two cups of 
flour for baking powder or soda biscuit. 

Use one cup and a half of liquid to two cups of 
flour for batter breads, unless otherwise directed in 
receipts. 

Yeast Bread. 

Bread made from yeast requires certain condi- 
tions in order to be good. If cold, it will not rise, if 
too hot it will not rise, since the yeast is a plant and 
heat and cold alike will kill it. The yeast should be 
mixed with warm water, not hot, and set to rise in a 
warm place. It requires moisture and nourishment 
which it gets by mixing with the flour. Allow from 
four to five hours for making. It can be made in two 
and a half hours if a sufficient quantity of yeast is 
used. 

Yeast bread should be baked in a hot oven. If it 
is loaf bread, have the fire hot enough to allow the 
bread to rise fifteen minutes before browning. Keep 
the oven at the same temperature while baking. To- 
ward the last when you think the bread is done 
through, you can lower the temperature a little and 
let it stay a little longer to settle. 

White Bread. 

Scald one cupful of milk, add one cupful of hot 
water. Pour over one-half tablespoon each of lard, 
butter and sugar, and one and one-half teaspoons of 



BREADS. 93 

salt. Disolve one yeast cake in one-fourth cup of 
lukewarm water and add to the first mixture when 
lukewarm. Add enough flour to knead and knead 
until smooth and elastic. Let it rise until it has 
doubled its bulk. Cut it down, rise again, shape, rise 
again, and bake in a hot oven from fifty to sixty 
minutes. 

Water Bread. 
Use the receipt for white bread using all water. 

Rolls. 

Scald one pint of milk, pour it over two table- 
spoons each of butter and sugar, and one teaspoon 
of salt. Cool, add one-fourth of an yeast cake dis- 
solved in one-fourth cup of lukewarm water. Add 
flour to make a sponge, about three cups. Beat well, 
let it rise until light, then add enough flour to knead. 
Knead thoroughly, let it rise until light, cut down, 
shape, rise until light and bake in quick oven. 

If the bread is made at night to be used for break- 
fast, or early in the morning to be used for tea, use 
the above receipt. If you want to make bread in four 
or five hours use the same receipt except use one yeast 
cake instead of one-fourth. Do not use one cake in 
all yeast bread receipts. Be guided by the length of 
time you have for making the bread. 

Use this same receipt in making all rolls. If 
shaped differently they take the name from the shape 
into which they are made. Sometimes they are glazed

with whites of egg over the top and sugar sprinkled, 
over. Sometimes a little pulverized cinnamon is added

Bread Sticks. J 

Take off small pieces of white bread dough, roll 
with the hand on the board into slender sticks about 
seven or eight inches long. Bake in a hot oven.. 
They should be baked brown and be crisp through. 

Crescents and Twists. 

Crescents and Twists are made from the same 
dough. For twists use two sticks twisted together. 
For crescents make the sticks a little larger and shape 
as crescents. 

Potato JRolls. 

One cup of flour, one cup of mashed boiled Irish 
potatoes, three-fourths cup of lard, one cup of milk, two 
eggs well beaten, one-half (scant) cup of sugar, salt to 
taste; one cake of compressed yeast dissolved in one- 
half cup of lukewarm water; mix flour, lard, potatoes,, 
sugar, salt and eggs, then milk, then yeast, set to rise

makes a nice breakfast dish to pour while it is hot in 
baking powder cans, and when cold, remove and slice 
in thin slices; dip in flour and saute in butter on both 
sides until brown. 



ENTREES. 

Entrees are made from left-overs and are nsed to 
supplement the prepared dishes of meat for a il and 
are generally brought in with the third or four\, course 
or between courses. There will not be a great variety 
given in this chapter as they will be found through 
the book. 

Croquettes. 

Croquettes can be made by simply mixing, grind- 
ing or mincing the material you want to use and mix- 
ing with a highly seasoned sauce.. Or, they can be 
made richer by combining two or three meats, and 
adding sweetbreads, brains, truffles or mushrooms. 

Sauce for Croquettes. 

Melt one tablespoon of butter, add one teaspoon of 
chopped onion and cook until tender; add two table- 
spoons of flour, one cup of cream or milk. Just before 
removing from the flre add two eggs beaten. Season 
with salt, white and red pepper and a little nutmeg. 
Mix with two cups of minced meat. Spread on a flat 
dish, when cool shape in balls or fingers or pear shape. 
Dip in sifted crumbs, then in egg, again in crumbs, 
taking care to entirely cover to prevent the grease 
from penetrating. Put five or six in a frying basket, 
dip in smoking hot fat and fry a delicate brown. 



106 ENTREES. 

Drain on manilla paper over a colander. Do not fry 
more than five or six at a time as you cool the lard toO' 
much and you have to wait between each frying to re- 
heat the fat (see crumbing) . 

Chicken Croquettes. 

Boil one good-sized chicken until tender; when 
cold take all the meat from the bones and grind it 
with one can of mushrooms, soak one-half pound of 
dry bread crumbs in one and one-half pints of the broth 
the chicken was cooked in; add one-fourth pound of 
butter, one teaspoon of chopped onion and four eggs; 
mix altogether and cook; season with celery, salt, red 
pepper and parsley; let it cool, shape, chill, dip in 
crumbs, egg, crumbs, and fry in deep fat. Serve with 
Alemonde or Tomato Sauce. You can use one cup 
of sweetbreads or brains instead of mushrooms. 

Sweetbread Croquettes. 

Sweetbreads are so delicate and light that you 

must mix some chicken and mushrooms with the 

chopped sweetbreads; mix with croquette sauce. 

Chill, shape, crumb, egg and crumb. Fry a delicate 

brown. 

Salmon Croquettes. 

One can of Salmon, one cup of bread crumbs, one 
cup of cream or milk, one tablespoon of butter, two 
eggs, red pepper and salt. Scald the milk and pour 
over the bread crumbs, add the butter and eggs. 
While the mixture is hot put in the minced salmon, 



ENTREES. 107 

season. You. can use one-half cup of crumbs and one 
cup of mashed potatoes, if desired. Do not season 
with lemon, but serve with lemon quarters and let 
each person use the lemon to suit the taste. When 
the mixture is cold, shape, dip in crumbs, egg and 
crumbs. Fry in smoking fat. 

Fish Croquettes. 

Pour one cup of croquette sauce while hot over one- 
half cup of bread crumbs. When cool mix in two 
cups of ground or minced fish. Shape, dip in crumbs, 
egg and crumbs again and fry. 

Egg Croquettes. 

Eight hard boiled eggs, one-half pound of crumbs 
one pint of cream, one-fourth pound of butter. Scald 
the cream and pour over the crumbs, beating all the 
while; add eggs, ground or put through ricer, season 
with salt and red pepper, chill, shape, dip in crumbs, 
egg and crumbs; fry a delicate brown in hot lard. 

Cheese Croquettes, No. 1. 
Mix one-half cup of croquette sauce with one and 
one-half cups of grated cheese. Beat the whites of 
two eggs stifE and light. Shape in rounds or cut in 
pieces one-half inch wide and four inches long. Dip 
in crumbs only and fry. 

Cheese Croquettes, No. 2. 
Beat the whites of four eggs stiff, add two cups of 
grated or ground cheese, one heaping tablespoon of 



108 ENTREES. 

flour, a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper or paprica 
to taste, shape in fingers or balls, roll in crumbs and 
fry a delicate brown. 

Veal, Lamb, Oysters, and Lobsters, Potatoes, Kice 
and Peas, can all be made into croquettes, using the 
receipt for chicken croquettes in making the meat 
croquettes and mixing the vegetables with the cro- 
quette sauce. Or, you can make the meat cro- 
quettes with the sauce and perhaps it will be a little 
less trouble. 

Almond Croquettes. 

Make a heavy cream sauce by cooking two table- 
spoons of butter with two tablespoons of flour to- 
gether. Add one cup of milk and cook until it be- 
gins to thicken, add one cup of almonds blanched and 
chopped. Pour on a flat dish; when cool cut in small 
squares or oblong pieces, dip in crumbs, egg and 
crumbs and fry a delicate brown. 

Chicken Cutlets. 

Mix two cups of ground chicken with one cup of 
cream sauce. When cold, make into pear shape, 
then flatten between the palms of the hands until 
they are one-half inch thick. Dip in crumbs, egg and 
crumbs. Insert a piece of spaghetti an inch long in 
the small end to represent a bone. Fry in smoking 
fat, and serve with oyster sauce. 



ENTREES. 109 

Sweetbread Cutlet&. 

Sweetbread cutlets are made in the same manner, 
using all sweetbreads, or mixing some chicken and 
mushrooms with it. Serve with alemonde sauce. 

Boiodans. 

One pound of chicken breast, one-fourth pound 
of butter, one-fourth pound of pickled pork; grind 
all the meat together, running it through the grinder 
twice; then mash through a colander, add three eggs, 
breaking in one at a time and beating the mixture as 
you would batter for cake; pepper and salt to taste, 
also a little onion chopped fine; stew a can of mush- 
rooms in their own liquor; put half into the meat 
before it is ground fine, the other to be cut up fine 
into the sauce; put the liquor from mushrooms into 
the meat, put into small molds and set them in a pan 
of hot water, cover over and cook twenty or thirty 
minutes in the oven; serve with a mushroom ; sauce 
made with two tablespoons of butter and one of flour 
cooked together; pour one pint of hot milk into it, 
add the mushrooms; salt and pepper to taste. 

You can give variety to these by filling the centers 
with a spoonful of peas or mushrooms, sweetbreads, 
truffles or brains. Cover the top with boudan mix- 
ture, so that whatever is used in the center will bo 
entirely encased. Sorhetimes nuts are stuck thick 
over the boudans after they have been removed from 
the molds. This improves the appearance very much. 



110 ENTEEES. 

Creme de Volaille, No. 1. 

Boil a chicken, pick the meat from the bones and 
grind; to three cups of chicken ground add half can 
of mushrooms, grind together, mix with one cup of 
cream sauce. Beat in one full tablespoon of butter

der mold, press the creamed chicken into it, set in a 



ENTREES. Ill 

pan of hot water, cover over, set inside the oven and 
•cook until firm — about thirty minutes, the time de- 
pending on the shape of the mold. If large and 
shallow, it will take less time. If cooked in a border 
mold, fill the center with peas or Parisienne potatoes. 
If a round or oblong mold, put the peas or potatoes 
■on the outside. This is a good receipt to use for any 
■cold meat; if pork, serve a puree of sweet potatoes; 
if lamb, serve peas; if beef, Irish potatoes, and so 
with other meats, serve with them the vegetables 
best suited, using your own taste and judgment. 
Any of these creamed dishes can be cooked and 
served in individual molds. They are then called 
timbals. 

Macaroni Timbals, or Spaghetti. 

Wind long strips of macaroni or spaghetti around 
email buttered molds, or cut the macaroni in pieces 
and ornament the molds in any fanciful way. Fill 
the centers with bits of cheese and macaroni, cut in 
small pieces, mixed with a cream sauce or filled with 
•creamed chicken, Place the molds in a pan of hot 
water, cover and cook until firm; turn out and servo 
with a cheese sauce. You can use fish, lobster and 
other meat and name them according to the meat 

used. 

Timbal Shells. 

Mix three-fourths of a cup of flour with one-half 
teaspoon of salt; add two-thirds of a cup of milk and 
one egg slightly beaten; when perfectly smooth, add 



112 ENTREES. 

one tablespoon of oil, dip a hot timbal iron in this 
batter and. fry the mixture which clings to the iron 
in hot fat deep enough to cover. They can be filled 
with oysters, mushrooms, sweetbreads or peas or a 
combination of these. If tha batter is not perfectly 
smooth, strain it. 

Bread Books. 

Out light bread in slices one and one-half inches 
thick, trim off the crust, making squares, or cut into 
rounds, cut out the centers loaving about ono-fourth 
of an inch from the edge. Do not cut clear through. 
Toast, dip in melted butter and fill the centers with 
asparagus tips or creamed oysters or sweetbreads. 

Sweetbreads. 

Let them stand in the cold water for an hour; 
change the water once or twice; put in cold water 
with a teaspoon full of vinegar and one of salL Cook 
gently until tender; plunge in cold water. Remove 
the strings and fibers without breaking the sweet- 
breads. 

To Squto Sweetbreads. 

Parboil the sweetbreads, press flat by wrapping in 
a cloth and putting weights on until cold; slice; melt 
two tablespoons of butter in a saute pan, put in the 
sweetbreads and saute on both sides. Servo with pep- 
per and salt. Serve with poas or asparagus tips 
placed in the center of the dish with sweatbreads 
arranged around them. 



ENTREES. 113 

To Fry Sweetbreads. 

Parboil, press flat, cut in pieces, dip in crumbs, 
egg and crumbs, fry in deep fat. Serve with any 
desired sauce. 

Creamed Sweetbreads. 

Parboil, pull in small pieces, pour a hot cream 
sauce over and stir lightly until heated through. 
Season with white pepper and salt. 

Calf Brains. 

Soak over night, free from the skin, drain and 
parboil as you would sweetbreads. Break in pieces, 
add one-half tablespoon of lemon juice, one-half cup 
of crumbs, two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, a table- 
spoon of tomato catsup if desired; sprinkle the top 
with crumbs and dot over with pepper and salt and 
bits of butter. Put inside the oven and cook fifteen 
or twenty minutes. It is very attractive to serve 
them in a border of rice with a parsley garnish. 

Aspic. 

Aspic is made from brown or white stock highly 
seasoned, clarified, and gelatine added. Add three- 
fourths of a box of gelatine that has been soaked one 
hour to one cup of cold water, then one quart of stock 
and one cup of wine. If veal has been used in mak- 
ing stock, use one-half box of gelatine. Clear as for 
soups, allowing the white of one egg to one quart of 



J 14 ENTREES. 

stock. Aspic is lised in ornamenting meats and for 
fancy moldings, and can be made very attractive if 
made properly. 

Some of the Ways for Serving Aspic Jelly. — 
Mold in flat pans one or one and a half inches deep. 
Turn out on a flat dish, cut in squares, diamonds, 
and triangles. Use as a garnish to cold meats. Mold 
in narrow, deep molds, brick shape convenient for 
slicing. Cut in slices one-half inch thick. Place on a 
lettuce leaf. Serve a celery and nut mayonaise over it. 

Patti Shells Filled wUh Creamed Meats. — Vol-au 
vents, rissoles, cheese ramekins, and many other 
dishes scattered through the book make nice entrees. 



SANDWICHES. 



Sandwiches are made by cutting bread into thin 
slices and then shaping. Spread with softened but- 
ter and then with the desired filling, press two pieces 
together. 

The bread for sandwiches should not be too fresh. 
Cut off the crusts of the bread, put in a paper bag in 
a dry place and use for crumbs. The bread may be 
<!ut into any shape. There are a great many fancy 
cutters for this purpose. 

The butter should be softened before spreading. 
The meat should be ground or minced fine, well sea- 
soned or mixed with a little mayonaise dressing, 
enough to moisten sufficiently to spread. Eggs, 
cheese, jellies, meats and nuts are used for sand- 
wiches. After they are made put in a shallow dish. 
Put a napkin dipped in cold water and wrung out 
well over the top, put a dry cloth on top of this and 
eet in a cool place. If they are to be packed and be 
used for lunch, wrap in oiled paper. 

Chicken Sandwiches. 

Mince or grind one chicken, moisten with mayo- 
naise. Cut the bread into any shape desired. Spread 
with softened butter, then with chicken mayonaise 

113

and press together. Chopped nuts can be added, 
and then you have a chicken and nut sandwich; or 
celery, and you have a chicken and celery, or salad 
sandwich. 

Nut Sandwiches. 

Grind or chop fine peanuts or pecans. Spread 
the sandwich with butter and then with mayonaise 
dressing. Sprinkle the nuts and then press together. 
A little shredded lettuce is sometimes used, or the 
nuts can be mixed with the mayonaise. 

Lettuce Sandwiches. 

Out the sandwich, butter, and spread with mayo- 
naise. Put a crisp lettuce leaf between, letting the 
green edge just come a little beyond the bread. Tri- 
angles, oblong pieces, squares or rounds are easily 
cut and are pretty looking. 

Egg Sandwiches. 

Chop hard boiled eggs and mix with mayonaise. 
Spread on the buttered sandwiches, or spread the 
sandwiches with mayonaise and cut the eggs in 
slices, putting a slice between the sandwich. 

Cheese Sandwiches. 

Spread the sandwich with butter and grated 
cheese worked together until it makes a paste. 
Sprinkle with a little salt and cayenne pepper. 



SANDWICHES. 

Olive and Cheese Sandwiches. 



117 



Use Neufchatel cheese and mix with it chopped 
olives. Butter the sandwiches and spread with the 
mixed cheese and olives. 

Candied Orange Peel and Ginger Sandwiches. 

Spread the sandwich with butter and lay thin 
slices of candied orange peel and ginger between. 

Ham Sandwiches. 

Cut very thin slices of ham, spread the sandwich 
with butter, put a slice of ham betweenf or grind or 
mince the ham, moisten with mayonaise and spread 
between the sandwich. 




PASTRY. 

PufP paste is used in making vol-au-vents, patty- 
shells, timbals, etc. It should be made in a cool place 
with cold material and thoroughly chilled before 
baking. The butter should be washed until the milk 
and salt are removed, and until it becomes pliable. 
Pat or work all the water out, fold in a napkin and 
keep in a cool place until ready for use. Paste can 
be kept several days. 

Puff Paste 

Two cups of flour, one cup of butter and one 
teaspoon of salt; use water enough to make a rather 
stiff dough. Wash the butter well and put a round- 
ing tablespoonful in the flour. Shape the other in a 
square cake and wrap it in a napkin and put it in a 
cool place. Mix the tablespoon of butter with the 
flour, with the tips of the fingers, working it to a 
rather stiff dough with about one-third of a cup of 
ice water and teaspoon of salt. Knead until smooth. 
Roll out an oblong piece, twice as long as wide. Put 
the cake of butter in the center, fold the sides and 
then the ends of the paste over the butter. Let it 
stand ten minutes. Turn the paste half around. 
Roll with rolling pin into an oblong piece with 

118 



PASTRY. 11(> 

light, quick strokes. Fold the ends to the center 
and then fold together. Turn and roll as before. 
Let stand a few minutes between each rolling. It 
should be rolled five or six times, then cut into 8hape> 
chilled and baked in a hot oven. 

Patty Shells. 

Roll puff paste one-fourth of an inch thick, cut 
with any desired shaped patty cutters. The pieces 
are put together, the top one having a small piece 
cut from the center. This piece should be baked 
separately and used as the top after the shells are- 
filled. These shells are generally made round, but 
hearts, diamonds, crescents and other shapes are 
sometimes used. They should be thoroughly chilled 
before baking, and should be baked on double ma- 
nilla paper, on baking sheets or in shallow baking 
pans. 

Vol-ato- Vents. 

Roll puff paste one-fourth of an inch thick, cut 
in rounds, the size desired. Put two or more layers. 
Cut out the centers of two top layers (if three lay- 
ers are used) . Bake the pieces that come from the 
centers for tops to vol-au-vents ; chill thoroughly and 
bake about thirty-five or forty minutes. Fill the cen- 
ters with mushrooms, sweetbreads, oysters, creamed 
chicken or anything desired. Pie pans are generally 
used to cut vol-au-vents. 



120 PASTEY.

mixed, if it is to be used; if not, wrap in a napkin 
and put in a cool place. 

Plain Paste, No. 2: 

Work one-fourth of a cup of lard into one and one- 
half cups of flour with the tips of the fingers; add one-

sweeten. Add one teaspoon of arrowroot dissolved 
in a little cold water, to each cup of syrup. Cook 
until fruit is tender. Apples, combined with orange, 
lemon, pine-apple, apricots, plums and all kinds of

raisins, candied cherries and orange peel, cut in small 
pieces, pour into the lined mold. When cold and stiff

ers of wine jelly and fruit bavarian. Put gelatine, one- 
half inch thick, in mold; when it begins to set, pour in 
a layer of bavarian, then wine jelly and so on until it is 
the size you wish. By the use of a double mold it can 
be made with the outside a sparkling gelatine and the 
inside bavarian, or it can be molded in a border mold 
and the inside filled with crystal gelatine or whipped 
cream. 



Charlotte Russe. 



Use cream at least twenty-four hours old; if too 
old, it will go to butter; if it is not old enough, it does 
not whip well. It should be very cold. Set in a 
bowl of ice and water; whip with a Lyon or wire egg 
whip; if the cream is just right, it will whip in a few 
minutes. Keep in a cool place until ready for use. 
If it is to be sweetened and flavored, do it when ready 
for use. The quickest and simplest way of making 
Charlotte Kusse is by the following receipt. 

Charlotte Russe, No. 1.

a cup of cold water for an hour, dissolve by adding one- 
third cup of boihng water; whip two cups of cream,

any desired flavoring; pour in the gelatine and beat 
hard with cream whip; line a mold with lady fingers 
or strips of cake and pour in the mixture; when it 
stiffens, it is ready to serve. It gives variety to use 
cake iced in two colors, a strip one inch wide of white 
and one of pink or any other color; alternate tho 
colors. Line the mold with oiled paper, then with 
the cake, pour in the charlotte russe. When it 
stiffens, turn out and garnish through a rose tube 
with some of the charlotte russe filling.

of ice water until it begins to thicken, add the whites 
of three eggs beaten stiff, and the whip from one pint 
of cream. Chill before serving. The cream may be 
omitted. If preserved strawberries are used, less 
sugar is required. This dish can be made very at- 
tractive by molding in a melon shaped mold — turn on 
a flat dish; garnish the outside of dish with straw- 
berry leaves and large fresh strawberries. li the 
strawberry juice does not give sufficient color use pink 
fruit coloring.

sugar and three cups of cream. Cook in double 
boiler, stirring all the while, until it is thick. Divide 
the custard and add to one-half, one-fourth of a cake 
of Baker's chocolate, melted and diluted with two 
tablespoons of hot water, also twelve macaroons, pul- 
verized or broken in small pieces; let this cook a 
moment and set aside to cool. Add to the other half

dered iji a mortar, and one-fourth pound of citron 
shaved and powdered or minced; let it cook a 
moment and when cool spread one cake with choco- 
late mixture, piling it up high; the other with the 
almond. Stack together and spread a meringue 
(made of the whites of eggs) over the top and sides. 
Brown in the oven. 




JELLIES. 



Always soak gelatine in cold water some time 
before dissolving in hot water. Use one-half cup of 
sugar to one pint of liquid, unless the fruit juice 
requires more. If you use very acid fruit, it neces- 
sitates more sugar. Use the third of a box of gela- 
tine to three cups of liquid. 

Wine Jelly, No. 1. 

Pour one pint of cold water over the contents of 
a box of gelatine, let stand for one hour; pour one 
pint of boiling water over, add one and a half cups of 
sugar, the white of an egg slightly beaten, the juice 
of two lemons, a piece of stick cinnamon; let it boil 
a minute, add two cups of wine, strain. 

Wine Jelly, No. 2. 

Soak a box of gelatine in one pint of cold water. 
In one hour add two pints of boiling water, two cups

more of sugar. 

Grape-juice Jelly. 

Pour over one-half box of gelatine, one cup of cold 
water, let stand an hour, add one and one-half cups of' 
boiling water, one and one-half cups of sugar, one- 
fourth cup of lemon juice, and one cup of grape- 
juice. 

Champagne Jelly. 

Pour one pint of water over one box of gelatine, 
let stand one hour. Add one and one-half pints of

lemon juice, two-thirds cup of orange juice, the whites- 
of two eggs and the shell broken in pieces, let it cook 
five minutes, stirring all the while until it reaches the 
boiling point; let it stand for ten or fifteen minutes- 
on back of stove. Strain through a flannel bag; add 
one pint of champagne. 

Crystal Jelly. 

Make any one of the preceding jellies and when 
it begins to thicken, whip briskly with a wire whip 
until it becomes light and frothy. 



152 JELLIES. 

Fruit Jelly. 

Use lemon or orange jellies and just before it stiff- 
ens add candied fruits cut in pieces. 

Pine-apple Jelly. 

Pour one cup of cold water over one-half box of 
gelatine ; add one and one-half cups of boiling water, 
one cup of sugar, the juice of one or two lemons, one 
cup of pine-apple syrup. When it begins to stiffen 
add the pine-apple cut in small pieces and stir to get 
the pieces of pine-apple mixed well through. 

Jellied Peaches. 

Peel peaches and seed them, cut in halves, pour 
jelly (just before it becomes stiff) over them and mix 
lightly with a fork, so that the peaches will be well 
coated with the jelly. 

Jelly with Whipped Cream and Fruit. 

Mold jelly in any pretty shaped mold and surround 
with whipped cream; if a border mold is used, fill the 
center with cream. To retain perfect shape when un- 
molded a smaller quanity of liquid or a larger quanity 
of gelatine must be used. Champagne jelly with a 
little gold leaf added and made quite stiff, makes a 
handsome center piece by using pyramid-shape mold. 
Wine or any of the fruit jellies can be molded in bor- 
der or fancy molds, the dish garnished with fruit and 
served together. Candied cherries, pine-apple and 
other candied fruits can be molded in jelly, either 



JELLIES. 153 

mixed in, or the mold can be lined with them, cut in 
fanciful shapes and molded in layers through the 
jelly. The jelly can be colored in delicate tints 
broken up and piled together. A delicate green is 
attractive with malaga grapes molded in it either in a 
large bunch or scattered through, or colored pink and 
pink grapes used. 



CAKE. 



Always sift the flour and sugar before measuring. 
The success of making cake depends upon the kind 
of butter and flour used, and how it is mixed and 
baked. Use light-colored butter. The rich yellow 
butter does not make good cake, it is too oily. The 
flour must be at least three months old, light and 
dry. Wash the butter in water (in summer use ice 
water) and cream until very light; add the sugar and 
cream well together, alternate the milk and flour, add 
the baking powder to the last cup of flour, beat the 
eggs stiff and fold in at the very last. It is not so im- 
portant about the mixing of flour and eggs, the secret 
is in creaming the butter and sugar. Delightful cake 
can be made without beating the eggs separately, but 
adding one at a time to the mixture and beating the 
batter well. In that case one cup of the flour is put 
in last with the baking powder. Line the bottom of 
the pans or molds with manilla paper, brush over 
with a brush dipped in melted lard. Bake with an 
increasing heat, avoid having the oven hot at first. 
If you are cooking a large mold cake, cover with a 
tin top and put a pan of water on the upper grate. 
After it has been in the oven fifteen minutes increase 
the heat a little, when it has risen to the top of the 

134 



CAKES. 155 

pan increase the heat a little more, remove the cover 
and bake until it begins to brown, then the pan of 
water can be taken from the upper grate ; continue 
the baking until done. You can determine this by 
inserting a broom straw, if it is perfectly smooth, 
none of the batter adhering, it is done. Leave in the 
pan until cold, slip a thin-bladed knife around the 
edges, invert the pan and the cake will slip out; trim 
off the rough and brown edges, when icing can be 
spread on if it is to be iced. Cakes to be used for layer 
cake or filled cake are baked in round, square or dia- 
mond pans from one half to two inches deep. When 
baked in square pans, each layer can be cut in half and 
two small cakes made in brick shape. Use different 
fillings for each one, which gives variety with juat a 
little niore work and expense. Layer cakes are baked 
as the mold cakes, with an increasing heat, and bakod 
from twenty to thirty-five minutes, according to the 
thickness of the layers. Do not cover them over the 
top, and it is rarely necessary to use a pan of water 
in the upper grate. There can be no accurate test 
for the heat of an oven ; stoves, and stove material, 
differ so in the amount of fuel required and the way 
they retain the heat. The best test is experience. 

Layer Cake, No. 1. 

One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, one cup of 
milk or water, three and one-half cups of flour, two 
full teaspoons of baking powder, the whites of eight 
eggs. Follow directions for mixing and baking. 



156 CAKBS. 

Layer Cake, No. 2. 

Three-fourths of a cup of butter, one and three- 
fourths cups of sugar, three-fourths cup of milk, three 
cups of flour, two teaspoons of baking powder, the 
whites of six eggs. 

Gup Cake. 

Use above receipt, using three whole eggs instead 
of six whites and one-half cup of butter instead of 
three-fourths. 

Plain White Loaf Cake. 

Either of the receipts for layer cake can be baked 
in loaf pans and are very nice, but if one is willing 
to do the work of mixing and baking the cake, by 
using the receipt below you will find it will pay you 
for your trouble. 

Plain White Cake. 

Cream one-half pound of butter, add very slowly 
and gradually three-fourths of a pound of flour. Beat 
the whites of fourteen eggs stiff. Add one pound 
of sugar slowly, beating all the while. Combine the 
two mixtures at first by adding a spoonful of the 
sugar and egg mixture until it becomes a stiff batter, 
and then you can beat the remaining egg and sugar 
more rapidly. Dissolve one-fourth of a teaspoon of 
soda and one teaspoon of cream of tartar in one table- 
spoon of whisky or water, stir in the batter. Line 
the bottom of cake mold with paper, grease around the 
sides and stem, bake with increasing heat from one 



CAKES. X57 

and one-half to two hours, or even longer. Cover 
the cake pan with a top, put a pan of hot water on 
the upper grate. Cook very slowly for the first hour, 
after that increase the heat. Leave the cake in the 
pan until it is cold. This same receipt can be used 
and mixed as layer cake receipt, but it is thought by 
some to be better mixed by the receipt I have given. — 
Mrs. Amos Turney. 

Pound Cake. 

Three-fourths of a pound of butter, one pound of 
sugar, one pound of flour, the whites of eight eggs, 
the yolks of six. Cream butter and sugar until very 
light, put the yolks of eggs in and beat hard, then 
add the flour gradually, beating all the while; stir in 
the whites of the eggs last. Bake from two to three 
hours. This same receipt can be used, leaving out 
the yolks and adding the six whites. 

Marble Cake. 

Use plain white cake batter and divide in two or 
three parts. Color one pink, another chocolate or 
spice one part and add the yolks of two eggs, put in 
a mold in layers and they will run together giving it 
a motled appearance; or you can arrange the batter 
in the pan to suit the taste. Bake as a white cake.

FRUIT CAKE. 



In making fruit cake always prepare the fruit 
before mixing the cake. Haisins should be seeded 
and cut in pieces, currants washed and stemmed, citron 
shaved, nuts shelled and broken in pieces, almonds 
must first be blanched and then broken or split, the 
fruit dredged with flour, put it in a wooden tray, sift 
a little flour over, mix it well through, this is very 
important as the fruit will all go to the botton unless 
it is well dredged. In making black cake you use 
browned flour which you make by putting a pan of 
white flour in the oven, stirring it all the while, so it 
■will be browned evenly. This should be done the day 
before, or it can be browned and kept in a dry place 
and used when needed. 

Fruit Cake, No. 1. 

Two cups of butter, one of sugar, two cups of 
molasses, one cup of sweet milk, five cups of flour, 
four eggs, one teaspoonful of soda, one teaspoon of

cinnamon, one pound of raisins, one pound of cur- 
rants and one-half pound of citron. Bake in a slow 
oven for three hours.

the yolks of eggs beaten light, then the flour and 
spices, then the whites of eggs beaten, then the 
brandy, seed and chop the raisins, clean the currants, 
cut the figs and citron in thin slices, dredge with 
flour and put in the batter alternately, with the nuts 
broken in pieces.

cup of sour milk, three cups of flour, one cup of 
blackberry jam, three eggs, one teaspoon of cinna- 
mon, one of allspice, nutmeg to suit the taste, one 
teaspoon of soda. Bake in a mold or layer cake pan; 
if the latter, fill with chocolate or caramel filling.

square pans. When cool, trim the brown crust off, 
cut in square, triangle and diamond shapes. Use 
plain, white icing, cream or caramel icing or choco- 
late filling. Dip the little cakes in the icing by the 
use of a skewer; when cool, ornament with some of 
the icing with a fancy tube inserted in rubber cloth 
bags, which can be bought at any kitchen furnishing 
store. The icing for ornamenting must be stifEer 
than for dipping. If when the icing is cold, it is 
not stiff enough, add pulverized sugar. One can 



FKUrr CAKE. 183 

make an innumerable variety of fancy cakes by using 
the different receipts for cakes, bake in shallow pans, 
cut in fancy shapes, use any desired icing, ornament 
with fruits, nuts, cocoanut, jellies, etc. The icing 
can be made in different colors by the use of fruit 
colorings. When the cakes are dipped in one color, 
ornament with another; if you use white icing, orna- 
ment with pink or green ; if you dip the cakes in pink, 
ornament with a deeper shade or use white, and so on. 
Use your own taste and make the cakes to suit the 
occasion. Green and white is attractive and suited 
for the springtime; warmer colors for cooler seasons. 

Orange Cake. 

One-half cup of butter, two cups of sugar, the

dessert can be made from cooking sponge cake in gem 
pans, when cool scoop out the center, fill with whip- 
ped cream and candied cherries; cut in pieces angel- 
ique, (candied vegetable stems) serve on little plates. 



CAKES. 165 

ornament around the plate with cherries, whipped 
cream and little pieces of angelique. The angelique 
should be soaked in warm water for one half hour 
before using. When it is soft, cut in thin strips, or 
cut in any shape desired. Tho easiest way of making 
little cakes is simply to cut in one and one-half inch 
squares, dip in different colored icings and ornament 
with candied cherries or nuts. You can secure fancy 
cutters of any shape, such as daisies, apples, peaches, 
etc. Then ornament to suit the cutter used. One 
can secure leaves and stems already made, but you 
can cut them from angelique. If you wish to imi- 
tate apples and peaches, the use of a brush with col- 
oring is necessary. One will hare to be something of 
an artist for this. If you have the taste or possess the 
accomplishment it is delightful to indulge in making 
flowers and fruit to eat instead of hanging them upon 
the walls. A 'very pretty and easy way of making 
little cakes, is to bake cake batter in shallow pans, 
cut in oblongs, squares, rounds and triangles; split, 
fill with an acid jelly or some of the fillings given in 
receipts, spread a thin icing over the top and orna- 
ment with a piece of fruit in the top, or it can bo 
made more elaborate with the addition of a fancy 
tube, making stems, etc.

fry the mixture that clings to the iron. Shake from 
the iron and repeat. 



FILLINGS FOR CAKES. 



White Icing. 

The proportion of sugar, water and eggs is three- 
fourths of a cup of sugar to each white of egg; one- 
third cup of water to each cup of sugar. Cook the 
sugar until it hairs or threads, when poured from a 
spoon. Beat the egg to a stiff froth and pour on the 
syrup slowly in a fine stream; beat until it is thick 
enough to spread. Flavor. If it should become 
grainy add a little hot water; if it is not cooked 
enough put the bowl of icing inside of a warm oven 
and stir now and then to prevent a crust forming. A 
spatula or a broad bladed knife is generally used in 
icing a cake. In icing a layer cake, you trim off the 
brown crust, and if cooked in a square pan, by cut- 
ting each layer in half you can make two cakes of 
three layers each, and they are called brick cakes. 
Icing is spread thin, between each layer, and then 
smoothed over the tops and sides. For filling a brick 
cake, it requires the whites of two eggs, one and- one- 
half cups of sugar and t,vo- thirds of a cup of cold 
water. If iced whole, use one more egg and sugar 
and water in proportion. This icing is colored pink, 
green, or any desired color by the use of fruit color- 
ing. If the paste is used dissolve in a teaspoon of 



172 FILLINGS FOR CAKES. 

water; if liquid, use a very little at a time or you will 
color too deeply. Almond filling. Use white icdng, 
and, after spreading the icing, sprinkle heavily on 
the top with almonds chopped fine. Ornament the 
top with almonds split in half. 

Cocoanut Icing. 
Use white icing, sprinkle freshly grated cocoanut 
over as you do the almonds. Sprinkle over the tops 
and sides while the icing is moist and the cocoanut 
adheres well without any trouble. 

Marshmallow Icing. 

Use white icing, and just before spreading it on 
the cake, melt one-fourth of a pound of marshmal- 
lows by putting three tablespoons of hot water over 
them and set in a vessel of hot water until melted. 
Pour the melted marshmallow into the icing, spread 
between and over the tops and sides of cake, and 
ornament the top with marshmallows cut in halves 
and quarters. 

Marshmallow Filling. 

Two cups of granulated sugar, one cup of milk, 
cook together until it strings; melt one-fourth of a 
pound of marshmallows, as in the above receipt, add 
to the cream filling and beat until stiff enough to 
spread. 

Fruit Filling. 

Use white icing and sprinkle candied chopped 
fruits over, ornament the sides and top by sticking 
bits of fruit thickly into the icing while it is soft. 



FILLINGS FOR CAKES. 173 

Rough and Ready Icing. 

Use white icing and stir into it before spreading 
on cake chopped nuts and seeded and chopped rais- 
ins and some candied cherries and pine-apple. The 
two last receipts can be made in numberless ways; 
mix different combinations of fruits and nuts in with 
the icing, or spread the icing on plain and then 
sprinkle with nuts or fruits, or both. Ornament the 
top and sides with whole kernels of nuts or fruits 
cut in fancy shapes. Candied pine-apple is nice for 
this. You can procure strawberries, limes, apricots 
and different fruits candied, and by the use of them 
you can ornament with little labor and skill. Chop- 
ped figSu are often used in icing for fig cake. 

Uncooked Icing. 

Beat the whites of two eggs until light, add enough 
pulverized sugar to make it of a proper consistency 
to spread. Flavor to suit the taste. 

Lemon Jelly. 

Into three tablespoons of fresh butter and a cup- 
ful of sugar, melted together, stir the beaten yolks 
of three eggs into which has been mixed the grated 
peel of a large lemon; stir over the fire until it be- 
gins to thicken, and add the juice of the lemon. 
Continue to stir until it is as thick as honey and then 
pour into jelly tumblers and cover. It makes a fill- 
ing for layer cake, and may be used for flavoring. 



174 FILLINGS FOE CAKES. 

Chocolate Filling, No. 1. 

One and three-fourths cups of sugar, three-fourths 
cup of water, cooked together until it makes a syrup

it reaches a soft ball stage when tried in cold water. 
Pour on a greased slab or dish. When it begins to 
cool work with a spatula until creamy. It can be 
flavored and colored to suit the taste. If it gets too 
stiff and a little grainy, wet the hand with cold water 
and work. Wrap in oiled paper ; melt over hot water 
when ready to use

FROZEN DESSERTS. 



Their name is legion. They consist of Philadel- 
phia and French ice creams with different degrees of 
richness. Frozen pudding, parfaits, biscuits, mousses, 
water ices, sherbets, punches and all of these varieties 
with different flavorings and manner of molding and 
construction give an infinite variety of beautiful 
ices. 

Plain cream is cream sweetened and flavored and 
frozen. 

French cream is made with a custard foundation 
(differing in richness) with cream added and frozen. 

Parfaits and biscuits are whipped cream with or 
without eggs, frozen by packing in ice and salt with- 
out stirring. 

Mousses are whipped cream and gelatine frozen 
as parfaits and biscuits. 

Sherbets are fruit juices sweetened with syrup 
and frozen. 

Punches are sherbets with liquor added before or 
after freezing. 

In freezing creams, use an ice bag and mallet, or 
put the ice in a small tub and use an ice shaver. Have 
the ice pounded or shaved fine; fit the can into the 
freezing bucket by placing the pivot which is on the 

177 



178 FROZEN DESSERTS. 

bottom of the can into the socket in the bottom of 
the bucket. Cork the opening in top of the can and 
put three inches of ice and one inch of salt around 
the can; press it down close, fill the bucket within two 
inches of the top of can, turn the can several times 
to see that it is in right, i Remove the top of can, put 
in the paddle, fitting it in the groove in the bottom of 
can, then pour in the mixture to be frozen, put on the 
top and adjust the crank, fill around with ice and salt 
within one inch of the top. Freeze with a steady 
turn for twenty or thirty minutes. Too rapid freez- 
ing makes the cream coarse-grained. When it is 
frozen (you can determine that by the crank becoming 
hard to turn) wipe with a wet cloth around the top and 
sides so that no salt can get in; remove the top and 
paddle, if there is to be any whipped cream, fruit, or 
nuts to be added, do it at this time, beating them in 
well; cut from the sides, press down, put on the top 
and cork the opening well. Fill around with ice and 
salt to the- top, crumple newspapers and put around 
the sides to keep the warm air out. Put away until 
it is ready for use, unless the cream is to be molded; 
in that case it is packed in the mold as soon as the 
cream is frozen, and it should not be frozen too stiff 
to press smooth into the molds. 

Molding Ices. 

The mold should be well chilled. Put the mix- 
ture in with a spoon and spread in smooth and even 
with the back of a spoon or a knife. Fill the mold 



FROZEN DESSERTS. 179 

with the mixture one wishes to use to the very top. 
Grease a piece of paper a little larger than the top of 
the mold with butter or lard, lay it over the mixture 
(greased side up) . Put on the top, which should fit 
very tight, seal around the edges with a strip of pa- 
per with a heavy coating of lard or butter, or a strip 
of cloth, one inch wide, dipped in melted lard. Set 
the mold on a bed of ice, pounded in small pieces, 
sprinkle heavily with salt, fill around the sides and 
over the top with ice and salt, pack in a bucket just 
large enough to allow for the packing. If two or 
more kinds of ices are to be used in the same mold, 
place the mold in ice and salt, line it an inch or more 
thick with one kind of cream, fill the center with a 
different kind of flavor and coiored ice, or you can 
pack with three or four colors in layers, or in round 
cans, having the stripes run vertically; this is done 
by the use of a heavy piece of paper and draw- 
ing it out when filled. Biscuits are put in little 
paper boxes and then packed in tin boxes with trays 
and immersed in ice and salt. Individual ices are 
packed in this way in lead molds. They are trouble- 
some to make and the molds expensive, so that it does 
not pay one to worry with them when they can be 
bought in almost any design from the confectioneries 
at a reasonable price. 

To Unmold Creams. 

Dip the mold in cold water, wipe off dry, invert oil 
a dish. Put a cloth wrung out of warm water around 



180 FROZEN DESSERTS. 

for a moment and raise the mold. This should be 
done quickly and with care to prevent the edges 
melting. 

Garnishing Ices. 

There are many ways of garnishing and serving 
ices to make them attractive. If a melon mold is used 
and the colors are pink and white, or pink and green, 
use pink roses laid on the side of the dish. If it is 
corn color or yellow and in season, use Jonquils and 
some delicate green, or fruit can be used with their 
leaves very effectively. If a border mold is used, fill 
the center with fruit or whipped cream. Many of 
the ices are now served with a sauce.

kind of fruit and the taste of the person it is to be 
made for. Sugar is added to the fruit according to 
the acidity of it. If bananas are used they have 
only to be pressed through a sieve or cut in small 
pieces, they will not need additional sugar. Peaches 
do not need more sugar. Strawberries, apricots and 
raspberries need sugar sprinkled over and let stand 
in a warm place for an hour and press through a 
sieve. Apples should be stewed and pressed through 
a sieve and sweetened afterwards, then added to the

Sherbets are fruit juices sweetened with sugar or 
syrup and frozen or served with crushed ice, and are 
generally served with a meat course or between 
courses. By the addition of liquors before or after 
freezing, you have punch. If the liquor is put in be- 
fore the freezing it will take longer to freeze. Some

sufficiently to take the form of the mold, pour out the 
unfrozen water and serve the cups on a small plate 
with a fancy mat or doily; fill stacked up high with a 
frozen sherbet, plain or fruit. Each cup can be made 
a different color, and is a very attractive way of serv- 
ing ices.

sugar, cool and add one-half cup of tea infusion, one- 
half cup of lemon juice and one-half cup of orange 
juice; freeze to a mush and add one-half cup of rum. 

Champagne Punch. 
Use above receipt and substitute one cup of cham- 
pagne for one-half cup of rum, or more champagne 
can be used. 

Maraschino Punch. 

Use receipt for Roman Punch, and substitute one 
cup of marashino wine for the one-half cup of rum. 

Pistaschio Punch. 
Make a lemon or fruit sherbet, color a delicate

pistaschio nuts. 

Fruit Punch. 

Use two cups of fruit juice — strawberry, raspberry 
or any fruit desired — or mix several kinds with two 
cups of water, one-half cup of lemon juice, two cups 
of sugar; if the fruit used is sweet, use more lemon, 
or add one-half cup of orange juice. Apollonaris 
water is used in punches and is very nice. Some 
prepared fruit can also be added to give variety. 



SAUCES FOR CREAMS.

cool, a little lemon or orange juice, if the fruit is 
very sweet. 

Orange Sauce. 

Remove the peel from three oranges, and pull the 
oranges in pieces. Make a syrup of one cup of sugar 
and one-half cup of water. Boil the pieces of 
oranges for two or three minutes, remove and boil 
the syrup down a little. Use the orange as a garnish. 
Add one-half cup of curacco cordial to the syrup and 
use as sauce. 

Whipped Cream Sauce. 

Whip one cup of cream stiff; add one tablespoon 
of powdered sugar, and two tablespoonfuls of sherry

can use fruit syrup instead of wine to flavor with. 

Sauce for Frozen Puddings. 

Beat the yolks of three eggs light and add one- 
third of a cup of powdered sugar. Dissolve one des- 
sertspoon of gelatine in two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Cook the egg and sugar over hot water until it be- 
gins to thicken. Remove from the fire and add the 
gelatine. When cool add one cup of cream whipped, 
two tablespoons of brandy and four of sherry wine, 
or use only vanilla. 



FRUIT. 

Fruit is best served fresh. It should not be too 
ripe and should be cold. Combined with green leaves 
it can be arranged with good effect. Grrape leaves, 
with different colored grapes and interspersed with 
other fruits, give a pleasing effect. Apples should 
be washed and rubbed until polished. Peaches should 
have the down taken off with a soft brush before serv- 
ing, or they can be peeled and seeded, cut in halves 
and quarters, put in a stone jar, packed in ice and salt 
around and let stand an hour. Serve with whipped 
cream. A very pretty way is to rub well and seed, 
put on ice and when ready to serve peel and fill the 
cavities with whipped cream. Serve one peach to 
each person. Do not peel until ready for use as they 
discolor quickly. 

Strawberries. 

Strawberries when large and fine can be used as 
a fruit course with good effect by leaving their stems 
on. Place on the side of a small plate with a mound 
of pulverized sugar. 

Oranges. 

Out in halves, sprinkle with sugar and eat with a 
spoon, or cut a thick slice from the stem end, loosen

the orange pulp and remove. Pull in pieces, and put 
in a ston6 jar with sugar sprinkled over and a little 
sherry wine. Surround the jar with ice and salt. 
Vandike the edges of the orange shell and serve the 
orange pulp in the baskets. The baskets should be 
kept in cold water until ready for use. 

Frozen Fruit in Oranges. 

Cut fresh or canned pine-apple in small pieces. 
Prepare oranges as above receipt, put a layer of pine- 
apple and one of orange and another of any kind of 
fruit you choose, a layer of sugar and so on. Put in 
a stone jar, pack in ice and salt, and serve in orange 
baskets with a teaspoon of sherry wine poured over 
each one. Two or three fresh strawberries put on top 
of each basket add to the appearance. If you do not 
care for the wine use a little fruit syrup or juice. 

Grape Fruit. 

Baskets can be made from the peel the same as 
for oranges for serving grape fruit, and are nice for 
breakfast or luncheon. Separate the pulp from the 
•skin, as the skin is very bitter, add sugar and let 
stand in a cool place until ready for use. Serve in 
baskets on a small plate; garnish the plate with 
orange leaves or holly. 

Pine-apple. 

Cut off the top of a large, fresh pine-apple. Cut 
the bottom so that it will stand upright and firm on 



FRUIT. 1991 

the plate. Scoop out the pine-apple pulp, put it in a. 
jar, pour one cup of orange juice over. Set on ice 
and surround with ice. When very cold, turn into 
the pine-apple shell. Garnish the dish with the pine- 
apple leaves from the crown. 

Bananas. 
Bananas are served whole with peel on as they 
discolor quickly. Arrange on a pretty fruit dish, or 
just before using, peel, slice and serve with pulver- 
ized sugar and whipped cream. They are often com- 
bined with other fruit and served as fruit salad or 
macedoine of fruit. 

Melons. 

Watermelon should be ice cold and cut in half, 
then cut in long vandikes; take the ripe meat from 
the pieces that were cut out and pile on top of the 
half melon. Serve one section to each person, or 
cut in halves, scoop out the ripe meat, pile in pieces 
on a dish, thus doing away with the rind that is sO' 
hard to manage. Cantaloupes are cut in halves and 
the seed scraped out. Fill each side with crushed 
ice. Serve one-half to each person. 

Macedoine of Fruit. 

Peel and slice, several oranges, use one pine-apple, 
or one can of pine-apple, two or three bananas. Al- 
ternate slices of the fruit in a deep bdwl, sprinkle- 
each layer with grated cocoanut. Pile grated cocoa^ 
nut over the top. Serve with whipped cream.

To Make Boiled Coffee. 

Use a good qualify of coffee, fresh boiled water 
and a thoroughly clean coffee pot; all these things 
are absolutely necessary for making good coffee. Do 
not grind the coffee too fine nor too coarse; if too fine 
it ■will be druggy, if too coarse you do not get the 
strength of the coffee without too much boiling. It 
should be ground a little coarser than granulated 
sugar. To one cup of ground coffee add the slightly 
beaten white of an egg and one cup of cold water; 
pour over four cups of freshly boiled water and boil 
three or four minutes; stop the spout of coffee pot 
with paper. Set on back of stove, cut down grounds 
from around the sides and add one-fourth cup of cold 
water. Let it stand ten minutes and serve. 

Coffee Made with Cold Water. 

The proportion is the same as for boiled coffee, 
Mix with white of an egg and a little' cold water, pour 
on the four cups of cold water and let it just reach 
the boil. Set on the back of stove three or four 
minutes and serve.

Drip Coffee. 

Grind the coffee very fine ; when a pot with strainer 
is used, put in the cofPee, allowing one full tablespoon 
of coffee to each cup of coffee. Set the coffee pot 
where it will keep hot, but not boil, pour the water 
on slowly, a cup at a time, it is ready to serve as soon 
as the water has dripped through. 

Cafe au Lait. 

Use receipt for boiled coffee, using one-half milk 
and one-half water. 

To Make Tea. 

Use all green, all black, or a mixture of the two, the 

latter being considered best by most people. Use one 

teaspoonful of tea to one cup of fresh boiled water. 

Pour the water on boiling, set on back of stove and 

let steep five minutes and be careful to use fresh 

boiling water. When a large quantity of tea is needed 

it is better to tie the tea in a swiss bag and pour over 

the boiling water. Allow enough tea to make very 

strong. Kemove the bag and add more fresh boiled 

water. 

Russian Tea. 

Add a slice of lemon to each cup of sweetened 

tea. 

Iced Tea. 

Iced tea should not be made too strong or it will

-fingers into a ball, which will retain any shape it is 
pressed into, it has reached the right degree, which 
is called soft ball. Carefully pour into a wide, flat, 
ungreased pan and stand in a cool place. When cold, 
or almost so, gather into a mass and stir constantly 
with a large spoon or wooden paddle until too thick 
to stir, then gather quickly into a ball and put on a 
marble slab and knead with the hands as you would 
bread. Let it stand a few minutes after kneading if 
you want to use it that day, if not, pack away in an 
«arthen dish until wanted. It should be a mass of 
pure white cream, looking like lard. It should be 
so firm you can cut it with a knife, and should melt in 
the mouth, leaving absolutely no grain. If there is 
a grain, it has either been stirred while boiling, 
shaken while cooking, or stirred before it was cool 
enough. This candy can be made into balls and 
Tolled in chopped nuts, or covered with chocolate, 
nuts worked into it and cut in squares; it can be col- 
ored with different fruit coloring; cinnamon is used 
to roll oblong pieces making potatoes. Holl in cocoa- 
nut for cocoanut balls. There are many ways of 
using fondant. It is the foundation of all French 
candies. The candy pudding can be used in the 
same way by leaving out the fruit at first and adding 
it as you want in making fruit candies.

To Use Scraps of Fondant. 

Take the scraps of fondant and roll into pieces 
the size of a lead pencil an inch long; chop the bits 
of nuts left and roll the candy into a little melted 
fondant and then into the nuts. 




CANNING. 



Canned goods can be bought from our grocery 
man so cheap that persons rarely find it necessary to 
can their own fruits or vegetables. To retain the 
color and flavor of fruit and vegetables should be a 
special aim; cook in a porcelain or granite kettle, stir 
with a wooden spoon. Hard, tough fruits should be 
cooked in water until tender before any sugar is added. 
Soft fruit should be cooked with the water and sugar 
or the juice of the fruit and sugar. Some fruits 
retain their color and flavor with sugar and some 
without sugar. All canned fruits should be put up 
boiling hot in the cans or jars, wrapped in paper and 
put in a cool, dry place. Use only the perfect fruit, 
not too ripe, and the sound, fresh vegetables. Have 
the cans or jars in readiness filled with boiling water, 
the tops, rubbers and sealing wax where they can be 
used at once for sealing the jars and cans. 

To Can Tomatoes. 

Pour boiling water over the tomatoes and remove 
the skins. Put into a kettle and let them become 
thoroughly heated or scalded. Fill the cans, wipe 
around the top and seal at once. If there is much 
juice it can be used for making catsup. 

213 



214 CANNING. 

To Can Corn. 

Cut tender, green corn from the cob, add one-half 
teaspoon of tartaric acid and two quarts of boiling 
water. Pour it over one gallon of corn and cook un- 
til the corn becomes tender. Seal at once. 

To Can Tomatoes and Okra. 

Peel ripe tomatoes and put in a porcelain kettle to 
cook. Wash and drain the okra, cut in pieces, pour 
boiling water over it and cook until tender. Skim up 
with a perforated spoon or ladle, and drop into the 
tomatoes. Put in the cans and seal at once. 

Peas, corn, lima an.d string beans, can be canned 
by filling jars compactly. Set the jars on a rack and 
set in a kettle of warm water and cook. Cook corn 
three hours, beans and peas one hour. 

To Can Asparagus. 

Wash the asparagus and cut in equal lengths. 
Stand them in cans, tips upward. Proceed as for the 
above receipt for canning vegetables, only cook one- 
half hour. A little salt should be added to all veg- 
etables. 

To Can Apples. 

Make a syrup of one pound of sugar, and two and 
one-half cups of water, boil ten minutes. Drop into 
the hot syrup four pounds of apples that have been 
washed, pared, cored and cut in halves or quarters. 



CANNING. 215 

Cook until tender. Put in jars. Drop the apples 
as soon as pared into cold water to prevent dis- 
coloring 

To Can Peaches. 

Pare and cut in halves (if the peaches are soft) ; 
make a syrup as above receipt, drop in the peaches, 
and if firm or a little tough, cook a few minutes in 
boiling water and then add them to the syrup and 
cook a few minutes; put in bottles and seal. 

To Can Pears. 

Use receipt for canning peaches. A little lemon 
juice or race ginger cooked in the syrup is an im- 
provement. 

To Can Quinces. 

Use the receipt for canning fruit, but cook the 
quinces first until tender in boiling clear water. 

The same directions can be followed for canning 
cherries and plums and all fruit. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 



Preserves should be cooked in small quantities, 
and cooked quickly, in order to be fair and retain the 
flavor. Use only the best granulated or loaf sugar; 
select the best fruits, not over-ripe, for jellies and pre- 
serves and reserve the over-ripe and blemished fruits 
for marmalades and jams. There are several ways 
of making preserves, and all satisfactory, but the 
easiest, quickest, the most satisfactory, is to cook 
fruit and sugar together; cook a small quantity at a 
time. Sometimes in making jellies it becomes ropy 
and will not congeal; choose always fruit in its prime, 
over-ripe fruit will not congeal well; too little sugar 
will also cause this, and sometimes a lack of acid 
in the fruit. In that case use a little tartaric acid 
or lemon juice. Jelly bags are made of part cotton 
and part wool flannel cut cornucopia shape, the seam 
felled to make strong; bind around the top. Sew 
several loops of tape around the top to hang it 
by. Dip in warm water before straining the jelly 
through. Jellies are made from fruit juices and 
sugar cooked together in equal proportions. After 
they are cooked and put in the glasses seal by cut- 
ting a piece of cotton or muslin the size of the top 
of the glass; dip this in whisky and lay over the jelly.

PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 217 

Cut letter paper one-half inch larger than the top, 
moisten the edge with the white of an egg and press 
it down closely all around the edge of the glass. 
Some glasses are made with the tops, in that case do 
not use the paper. 

Strawberry Preserves No. 1. 

Cap fresh, ripe strawberries, cook two pounds of 
berries and two pounds of sugar together until the 
berries are tender; put in the jars and seal. 

Strawberry Preserves No. 2. 

Use pound to pound of sugar and fruit; mix the 
sugar and berries and let stand all night or several 
hours. Put on stove, and when it is heated through, 
dip off some of the syrup; cook the preserves until 
tender; cook the syrup ten or fifteen minutes, bottle 
it and keep for flavoring, etc., or use for .ielly. Rasp- 
berries and blackberries are preserved in the same 
way. 

Raspberry Preserves. 

Use strawberry receipt No. 1, if you want the 
preserves especially nice, but strawberry No. 2 is good, 
and the syrup is useful for many things. 

Cherry Preserves. 

Pick the stems from cherries, seed them (preserve 
a few with the seeds) add a pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit and cook until the fruit is transparent. 



218 PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 

Damson Preserves. 

Damson preserves are made as cherries, or make 
a syrup of the sugar, adding just enough water to 
dissolve, then drop in the prepared fruit, a few at a 
time; prick each plum in several places to prevent 
the skin from coming off. 

Peach Preserves. 

Pare and cut in halves, use pound to pound of 
sugar and fruit. Cook together until the peaches 
are tender. Another nice way to make peach pre- 
serves is to pour water over the peach stones until the 
water is well flavored. Make a syrup of that water 
and the sugar and pour over the peaches. Cook un- 
til tender. 

Pear Preserves. 

Pare and cut in quarters, remove seeds and core. 
Cook in boiling water until tender, add to a syrup 
and cook a few minutes. The syrup is made by cook- 
ing three-fourths pound of sugar to one of fruit with 
enough water to moisten well. 

Quince Preserves. 

Quince preserves are made as pears. The par- 
ings are used in making jelly.

of sugar. Cook (after it begins cooking) thirty 
minutes. 

Citron Preserves. 

Pare, trim nicely and cut in fancy shapes. Cook 
ginger root tied in a thin cloth in one quart of clear 
water, cook until the flavpr is extracted. Remove 
the ginger, make a syrup of sugar and ginger water, 
add the citron and some lemon peel. Cook until. the 
citron becomes transparent. 

Marmalades. 

It is well to make marmalades with the preserves, 
using the very ripe and blemished fruit for marma- 
lades and the perfect fruit for preserves. 

Peach Marmalade. 

Pare and seed the peaches, cut in pieces, using 
pound to pound of fruit and sugar. Cook together 
until it begins to look clear. Try a little on a plate 
and if it becomes thick and stiff it is done. If the 
fruit is dry add a little water to prevent scorching. 

Quince Marmalade. 

Pare and cut in small pieces, cook in a little boil- 
ing water until it begins to get tender, add sugar (us- 
ing pound to pound of sugar and fruit) cook until 
thick. If you make the quince preserves at the same 
time use the water the quinces were cooked in for 
marmalade and the parings for jelly. 



220 PRESERVES AND JELLIES 

Brandied Peaches, No. 1. 

Use firm clingstone peaches, rub well to remove 
down; prick with a fork, or pare the peach. To each 
pound of fruit use one-half pound of sugar. To 
each one-half pound of sugar use one-half cup of 
water; cook peaches in syrup until tender, remove 
the peaches and place in a jar; to the syrup add 
(to each pound of fruit) one cup of the best brandy. 
Pour over the peaches; put in jars and seal. 

Brandied Peaches, No. 2. 

Pare clingstone peaches; use one-half pound of 
sugar to one pound of fruit, place in alternate layers 
in a stone jar, cover well with good brandy; cover the 
top securely. 

Grape Jelly. 

You can use green grapes or grapes barely ripe, 
or a mixture of the two. You can then have three 
colors from the same fruit. It is sometimes made 
separately. Put a layer of one in the glass and when 
it congeals then a layer of a darker shade, and so on. 
This is very pretty, but causes some labor and a little 
trouble. Currant jelly is made in the same" way, 
using white and red currants. Put about one pint of 
water over a gallon of grapes, picked from the stems, 
cook until the grapes are thoroughly scalded, strain 
through a puree strainer and the juice through a 
jelly bag: to each pint of juice add a pint of sugar; 
when it dissolves, strain again. Cook about twenty or 



PRESERVES AND JELLIid. "21 

twenty-fi^ , jainutes, or until it drops, thick from a 
spoon. Have the glass hot to pour the jelly in, 

Currant Jelly. 
Use all white, all red or a mixture. Pick from the 
stems, add barely enough water to prevent burning; 
cook about twenty minutes, strain, but do not press 
the bag. Use one pint of juice to one pound of loaf 
sugar after it begins to boil;' boil about twenty or 
twenty-five minutes. 

Blackberry or Raspberry Jelly. 
Blackberry and raspberry jellies are made the same 
as grape and currant. Raspberries are hard to jelly; 
Never gather fruit for jelly after a heavy rain or dew. 

Apple Jelly. 
Cut the apples from the core, and barely cover 
with water. Cook until tender when pierced with a 
straw. Strain and cook one pint of juice and one 
pint of sugar together until it jelUes. 

Crab Apple Jelly. 
Crab Apple Jelly is made as Apple Jelly. 

Quince Jelly. 
Use only the parings or cut the fruit from the 
core. Do not use the seed as they make the jelly 
ropy. , Pour over enough water to cover. Cook un- 
til tender and proceed as for apple or other jelly. 
Peaches, plums and gooseberries make nice jelly and 
are made as other fruit jellies,

SALADS. 



Meats, vegetables and fruits are served as salads. 
They can be served separately, or two or three or 
more together. Nuts are sometimes added, different 
dressings used, with numberless garnishings, making 
an infinite variety. 

It is necessary in making salads to have the dress- 
ings and ingredients cold. Cut the meat into 
cubes (not too small) , about one-half of an inch 
square. Season it with a little red pepper, salt and 
vinegar; let stand in a cool place until a short time 
before using, then mix with the dressing. 

There are many ways of serving meat salads. 
They can be piled in a dish and garnished with 
curled celery, lettuce leaves, endive, watercress, nas- 
turtiums, etc., or served in red and green peppers, 
which have had a piece cut from the stem end, seeds 
removed and stood in cold water for an hour or two; ' 
or serve in red apples. Cut out most of the apple, 
leaving only a hull or shell. Cut the apple that has 
been removed into pieces, mix with the meat, fill the 
shells and stand on lettuce leaves. There are many 
pretty ways of serving the salads, according to one's 
fancy and the occasion. 

In serving the green vegetables for salads, such 
as lettuce, endive, watercress, celery, etc., let them

mustard and pepper with the egg. Add a few drops 
of vinegar, then a few drops of oil, and so on, alter- 
nating the vinegar, oil and lemon juice. After the 
oil is thoroughly blended, adding it very slowly at 
first, you can then add it more rapidly. You can 
give variety to this dressing by using all lemon juice,, 
which makes a lighter colored mayonaise, and fold- 
ing in whipped cream just before using; or it can be 
colored a delicate green or pink by the use of fruit 
coloring. If the dressing should separate and begin.

into deep square pans to make a layer about one-half 
inch thick. When it begins to set put whole English 
walnut kernels over the top about one and one-half 
inches apart. Pour over more aspic, when it is cold 
turn out on a flat dish and cut in squares having a 
kernel of English walnut in each square. Serve on 
a leaf of lettuce. 




COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 



There will be no special receipts given under this 
head, as food properly cooked (when it can be eaten 
at all) is used for invalids. Select the material you 
wish to prepare and consult the chapter under which 
it belongs and there will be found delicate ways of 
cooking it. Beef tea is often given, and you have 
■only to extract the juice from the beef, cut into small 
Mts, pour a little cold water over it, cover and cook 
slowly; or put the meat into a bottle, cook and set 
the bottle in a pan of cold water; heat and let it 
stand in this water until the juice is extracted. 
Oruels are generally used without much seasoning; 
blanc manges without sugar or very little. Jellies 
are made in the same way, and eggs cooked in some 
of the various ways of preparing them. There is 
much in the serving of food for the sick; make it 
attractive. There is no better appetizer than the eye; 
use nice thin china, clear, well polished glass and 
silver made bright by rubbing; a tray to suit the size 
of the dishes served, the whitest and daintiest tray 
cloths and napkins; garnish the tray with a flower, 
or flowers, or something green and delicate. If the 
dish you serve is meant to be hot, have it hot, not 
lukewarm; if cold, have it cold; if congealed, do not 
let it look mushy; if frozen, have it well frozen. Con- 
gealed dishes are made more attractive by molding 
in a pretty-shaped individual mold with some whip- 
ped cream around.

MENUS. 



In preparing Menus consult the season, the mar- 
ket, the guests. Do not have canned goods when you. 
can secure fresh ones that are seasonable. Some can- 
ned goods are preferable to some found in the market 
for fresh. Fruits and vegetables are in season when 
plentiful and sold at a reasonable price. Do not use 
oysters in hot September weather even when they 
can be secured fresh. When preparing a meal for 
ladies select light and delicate things. If for gentle- 
men alone, use more substantial, but shorter course. 

Oysters as a rule come first, little neck clams in 
months when you cannot get oysters. 

Soups are served next. A clear soup if the meal 
is a heavy one. Bread sticks (toasted or baked) , 
wafers or cracker biscuits are served • with soups,. 
Hot hors d'aurve generally consists of timbales. 
croustades, ' etc. Olives, radishes, celery, etc., are 
served with this course. 

Fish is served next with potatoes or cucumbers 
dressed in vinegar and oil or the fish can be served 
with cucumber sauce. 

Usually an entree is served after the fish. Roasts 
or joints of meats with one or two vegetables come, 
next. 

247 



248 MENUS. 

Punch is served between the meat and game 
course, or a cheese course can be put in place of the 
punch. 

The game comes next, A salad is served with this 
course. 

Hot and cold sweet dishes are served next, such 
as suet, raisin or plum pudding, bavarians, charlottes, 
jellies, etc. 

Ices or frozen desserts and cakes. 

Fruits and bon-bons, 

Coffee. 

This is given as a guide for preparing menus. 
One or two entrees can be used, or both omitted. The 
first course can be omitted, and often only one meat 
course is served. But with the knowledge of how to 
arrange the dishes and a book full of good receipts, 
any one can make successfully their own menus. The 
direction given is for a full course dinner. For a 
home dinner have first a soup, then a meat and vege- 
table course, a salad, then dessert, crackers, cheese, 
and coffee. 

Luncheons are almost as elaborate as dinners.

that form on the sides should be wiped away with a 
doth or a little brush dipped in cold water and passed 
quickly around the edge. Syrups can be prepared and 
kept in air tight jars in a cool place until needed. In 
preparing syrups for ices use the proportion of sugar 
and water that your receipt calls for and after it has 



286 Appendix.

colored. Drop on buttered paper or slab into small 
rounds.

Canning Tomatoes Without Cooking. 

Select perfectly fresh and firm tomatoes and not coo 
ripe. Of a size that will slip in the jars without cut- 
ting. Eemove the skins and fill the jars. Add a tea- 
spoon of salt and fill the jars with boiling water. See 
that all the spaces are filled allowing no air bubbles. 
Seal at once with the tops that have been well soaked in 
boiling water. Set the jars in boiling water and let 
stand until the water is cold. Tighten the tops again 
if needed and put in a cool dark place. Fruit is canned 
in the same way using boiling syrup instead of salt and 
water. Strawberries, hard peaches, hard pears and 
apples will not keep this way. 

Pineapple in Shells. 

Cut off the blossom end of the pineapple and tiien 
cut them half in two. Cut out the pulp in small pieces 
leaving a thin shell only. Sprinkle the fruit over with 
sugar and mix any kind of fruit with it. Put in a 
stone jar and pack in ice and salt until thoroughly 
chilled. When ready for use fill the pineapples. Put

this and garnish with the leaves cut from the pineapple 
tops. 

Grape Fruit, Waldorf Style. 

Separate the pulp from the skin and break or pull in- 
to, small pieces. Shave some ice and fill large cham- 
pagne glasses. Put the fruit in a two-inch smaller 
glass with the stem broken off. Set this in the larger 
glass filled -with the ice. Put a teaspoon of wine over 
the fruit and sprinkle sugar over it. Set on a small 
plate with lace mat, decorate with red cherries and tiny 
green leaves. Tie a bow of red ribbon on the stem of 
the glass. Other fruits can be served in this way, u£- 
ing different decorations to suit the kind of fruit used. 

Rhubarb Wine. 

Cut rhubarb in inch pieces and cover with water. 
Set on the stove long enough to scald. Strain through 
a sieve and then a bag. To each gallon of straijied juice 
add one quart of boiling water and three pounds of 
sugar. Put in a stone jar and cover with a cloth. Skim 
every morning until fermentation ceases. Bottle and 
put in jaxs. — Mrs. Hdrbison.
