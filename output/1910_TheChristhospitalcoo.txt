This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

HOW TO MEASURE 

Correct meSisurements are absolutely neces- 
sary to insure the best results. Measuring cups 
which are divided into quarters and thirds, hold- 
ing Yz pint, are indispensable, also tea and table- 
spoons and a case knife. 

Flour, meal, powdered and confectioner's 
sugar should be sifted before measuring. 

A cupful is measured level. 

To measure a cupful, put in the ingredients 
by spoonfuls, rounded slightly and level with a 
case knife. 

To measure a tea or tablespoonful, dip the 
spoon in the ingredient, fill, lift, then with the 
straight edge of the knife resting on both edges 
of the spoon, push off all the extra material, leav- 
ing the material exactly level with the edges of 
the spoon. To measure J^, divide with a knife 
lengthwise of spoon. Divide halves crosswise 
for quarters. 

Measuring Liquids: 

A cup of liquid is all the cup will hold. A tea 
or tablespoon is all the spoon will hold. 

Measuring Butter, Lard, etc.: 

To measure butter, lard, or other solid fats, 
pack solidly into the cup or spoon and level with 
a knife. 

When dry ingredients, fats, and liquids are 
called for in the same recipe, measure in the order 
given, thus prevent using more than one cup. 



Soups. 



SOUPS. 

Soup making is not as difficult a task as it first 
appears. A stock pot is indispensable. When the 
meat comes from the market, all bones which are 
removed before meat is cobk-ed should be put into 
the pot together with any left over pieces of meat, 
cold water added, and be allowed to cook for 6 
or 7 hours; Vegetables, spices, and salt should 
be, added the last hour of cooking. In small 
families where the quantity of meat is less, it will 
be necessary to buy meat especially for soup. 
When this is done the meat is cut from the fore 
or hind shiri — because of the marrow-bones they 
contain. 

To clarify soup stock : 

I qt. stock. I eggy white anci sheU. 

3/2 cup cold water. 

Remove all fat. Beat egg white slightly. Add 
this and crushed shell to the jelly. Heat slowly to 
the boiling pointy stirring constantly. Boil 3 min., 
simmer 10 min., or until the soup clears, without 
stirring. Let settle, adding cold water. Strain 
through damp cheese cloth. 

Season, reheat, serve at once.

of the tray.

the tray.

the knife at the right of the plate — cutting edge 
toward the /plate. Place the spoon at the right 
of the knife, bowl up. Place the fork at the left 
of the plate, tines up. The individual butter is 
placed at the tip of the fork a little to the left. 
Place the cup and saucer at the right of the 
spoon, with the handle of the cup to the right.
