PREFACE 

This volume, like its companion, Shelter and Clothing y is in- 
tended for use in the course in household arts in the high 
school and normal school, whether the work be vocational or 
general in its aim. It is hoped that both volumes will prove 
useful in the home as well, including as they do a treatment 
of the homecrafts, and the related topics now so significant to 
the home maker, — the cost and purchasing of foods and 
clothing, the cost of operating, the management of the home, 
and questions of state and city sanitation vital to the health 
of the individual family. 

The volume treats specifically of foods, their production, 
sanitation, cost, nutritive value, preparation, and serving, these 
topics being closely interwoven with the practical aspects of 
household management, and they are followed by a study of 
the household budget and accounts, methods of buying, house- 
wifery, and laundering. It includes about 160 carefully se- 
lected and tested recipes, together with a large number of 
cooking exercises of a more experimental nature designed to 
develop initiative and resourcefulness. Shelter and Clothing 
deals with the organization and ideals of the home, house sani- 
tation, decoration, and furnishing ; and treats in full, textiles, 
sewing, costume design, and dressmaking. 

Some of the recipes here given are adapted from those of 
such authorities as Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Farmer, and Miss Bar- 
rows, and others are original and from private sources. 

The authors are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to 
those who have read and criticized the manuscript : Professor

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 

The topics in this volume are so arranged that they can be 
followed in sequence as the course of study develops through 
the year, with such modifications as seem necessary to the 
teacher in order that the work may best meet the needs of the 
pupils. The practice has become quite general of beginning 
the practical work in the autumn with the preparation and 
preservation of fruit, especially for those pupils who have had 
previous work in foods ; and this plan commends itself as be- 
ing seasonable and as making an appeal to the interest of the 
pupils. The opening chapters furnish material that is in part 
preliminary and that may also be studied as the practical work 
progresses from Chapter V onward. The preparation of a 
meal need not be deferred until all types of dishes have been 
cooked singly, as it is possible to prepare a luncheon box, to 
set an invalid tray, or to serve a simple breakfast quite early 
in the course, provided the equipment permits. If the school 
program allows, it is well to give a period to recitation at 
stated intervals, which would include a discussion of the text 
and of problems that arise from the laboratory work. The 
cost of food is a topic to be borne in mind throughout the 
year. It is an excellent plan for the pupils to record the 
current prices of each food material as it is used, and the cost 
of a given dish for a given number of people, the topic culmi- 
nating in a detailed discussion when the chapter on the cost of 
food is read. A similar method may be pursued in connection 
with the nutritive values of food, the theme developing from 
lesson to lesson, until the pupils are ready for the chapter on

menus and dietaries. An occasional lesson on housewifery oi 
laundering may be introduced from time to time, if a complete 
sequence of lessons on these topics does not seem practicable ; 
and through the year the pupils may be encouraged to keep 
simple accounts for themselves' and in connection with the 
supplies of the school kitchen. Those teachers are fortunate 
who may cooperate with a school lunch room, thus affording 
their pupils opportunity for dealing with practical administra- 
tive and economic problems. The way in which the topics are 
used must of necessity vary with the previous experience of 
the pupils, whether or not they have had cookery, chemistry, 
and physiology, and the teacher will use the exercises at the 
end of the chapters with freedom, omitting some questions, 
and adding others as the need arises.

FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD 
MANAGEMENT 

CHAPTER I 
FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 

Food problems. — " What shall I plan for the three 
meals? '' is a question as new each day as the day itself. 
That many women ask it, and are glad for an answer or a 
suggestion is proved by a glance at the daily or weekly paper 
or woman's magazine, whose publishers know that it pays 
to print menus innumerable. Indeed, the daily press is full 
of signs that the food problem is an acute one, for the cur- 
rent joke about food prices, the accounts of boycotts by house- 
keepers, popular articles on nutrition and pure foods, and the 
records of state and national legislation, all show that as a 
nation we are awake and seeking a way out of our present 
difficulties. 

Doubtless, the housekeeper has always found the task of 
suppl3dng food to her family one of the most perplexing, but 
modem conditions have made the difficulties manifold when 
contrasted with olden times. A pretty picture of household 
management in seventeenth century England is drawn by Sir 
Walter Scott in " Peveril of the Peak.'' The lord of the 
castle has invited the village people to a great feast in cele- 
bration of the restoration of Charles the Second, and Lady 
Peveril finds her larder rather low. To be sure, there are

carp in the pond, and deer in the park, but the beef question 
is puzzling, for the steward does not wish to kill his choice 
steer. Then appear in the courtyard two fine oxen, and 
several wethers, or sheep, gifts from a neighbor, and the 
menu is complete. Lady Peveril is described as an excellent 
housekeeper, and doubtless felt burdened by many cares, 
but how different were, her problems from ours, and how 
simple by comparison ! Beef trusts and the high price of 
beef, tuberculous cattle, unsanitary transportation and 
markets were not factors in her problem. In her day, and 
in the time of our grandmothers, less variety in diet was 
possible, and less expected except on state occasions; food 
was not transported over great distances, and the cost was 
not so much out of proportion to the average income. 

Now every large city, and even the small town, is the mar- 
ket of the world. We have long been accustomed to the im- 
portation of oranges and lemons, and dried fruits from distant 
lands ; but now we have peaches and pears from South Africa, 
melons from Spain, pineapples from the Azores, hothouse 
grapes from England, and apples from Australia, and in 
1913, we read of the shipment of beef from Argentina. In 
our own country, early fruits and vegetables travel from the 
south to the north, so that the season of some foods is long 
extended. The large amount of canned food also does away 
with the natural limits of the season, and this is further 
affected by cold storage. Both the quality and the cost 
of food are modified by these new methods of commerce, and 
furthermore, modern methods of manufacture have changed 
the quality. In an ideal community these changes would 
be for the better, but manufacturers often think more of 
their own profit than of the quality of their goods, and as a 
result adulterations have crept in, making necessary the 
enactment and enforcement of pure food laws. This is by 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 3 

no means so simple a matter as it seems, for we must first 
understand what pure food really is. 

Instinct guides somewhat in the selection of food where con- 
ditions of living are simple. Under more complex conditions 
there must be a scientific study of the whole situation in 
order that the individual may cope with it. Then, too, with 
such a variety of foods from which to select, it is easy to be 
tempted beyond our means, and to disregard the simple and 
the wholesome. We know that it is easy to develop a taste 
for some one food in excess, as for instance, sweets or dishes 
rich in fat and too highly flavored, and the physician adds his 
word here to the plea for a. study of food and its functions. 

The conclusion is this, that the housekeeper who has the 
welfare of her family at heart will not] confine her interest 
in food to cooking processes and new recipes. Good cooks 
we must have, and our standard of cooking could easily be 
raised. But other facts about food are important to-day, and 
as we learn to prepare and serve food daintily, we must study 
such topics as the following : 

What food is, its composition and how it nourishes us; 
how it is manufactured and transported; "pure food"; 
sanitary and convenient markets ; the cost of food and how 
to buy ; principles of food preparation ; suitable combina- ' 
tions and amounts of food. These topics are all treated 
in this volume, and should be considered as important as the 
actual preparation of food. 

Food Materials 

What is food ? — This would seem to be a difficult ques- 
tion to answer as we look about a modem grocery or market 
with its bewildering assortment of foods. It seems hardly 
possible to describe such a variety of articles in a brief sen- 



4 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tence, or to find a definition that will apply to all. Yet we 
seem to know instinctively what food is, although we may 
not find it easy to give a definition. Even the lower animals 
are guided in selecting food by some natural instinct and 
seldom make a mistake. 

A widely used government bulletin gives this definition : 
" Food is that which taken into the body builds tissue or 
yields energy or does both.'' Probably we have learned this 
in our physiology, and admit it to be true, but for practical 
purposes, we need a more complete statement than this. 
Let us carefully determine what our foods really are, and 
what elements they contain, in order that we may select 
wisely for purposes of nutrition,' and also that we may learn 
how to prepare food materials in a way that will utilize every- 
thing in them and waste nothing. 

Vegetable and animal foods. — It is easy to divide food 
materials in a general way into those derived from the vege- 
table kingdom and those derived from the animal kingdom. 
In the vegetable group we have first, the diflFerent parts of 
many plants, and second, substances manufactured from 
plants. While we do not usually eat the whole of any one 
plant, yet there is not any part of the plant that we have not 
adopted as food. We use roots and tubers in beets, carrots, 
and potatoes, and the onion is a bulb. In celery and 
asparagus we eat the plant stalk. Plant leaves give us 
lettuce and other salads, cabbage and the like. Peas and 
beans and nuts are seeds, and cauliflower is a part of the 
flower. The fruit as a whole is familiar in many forms. 
Manufactured vegetable food materials include flour, meals, 
breakfast cereals, starch, sugar, molasses and sirups. The 
animal kingdom gives us the flesh of animals, fish and shell 
fish, and substances derived from animals, like eggs, milk, 
and the milk products, cream, butter, and cheese. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 5 

These materials vary so much in appearance that they 
would seem to have nothing in common. If, however, we 
compare the food of different animals and different races of 
men, we cannot but conclude that this is a mistaken judg- 
ment. We find an animal like the lion feeding entirely upon 
the flesh of other animals, and a strong creature like the ox, 
eating nothing but grass and grain. We also note that one 
race of men includes meat in its diet, and another subsists 
almost entirely upon vegetable food, such as rice and beans. 
Yet in both cases, these diverse kinds of food accomplish the 
same end, — body building and the supplying of energy. 
Let us study two common foods, from the two kingdoms, 
and see if through this study we can discover in what ways 
they are alike. 

Comparison of milk and beans. — A moment's thought! 
enables us to see that in milk we have a food that must have 
all the elements needed in nutrition, since it is the only food 
taken by many young animals. The baby and the young 
calf find in it everything that is needed to build the growing 
body, and to give them energy. If you see a young calf 
frisking about the field, you can appreciate how well his food 
supplies his needs. 

A simple experiment will help us to find some of the sub- 
stances contained ,in milk. Let the milk stand imtil the 
cream rises on the top. Skim the cream, warm it slightly 
and beat it with an egg beater. Butter will soon " come," 
and butter, we know, is a form of fat. Warm a pint of the 
skimmed milk, add to it a dissolved rennet tablet, and set it 
in a warm place. In a short time, the milk becomes solidified 
to a consistency like that of jelly. If allowed to stand longer, 
a watery liquid will separate itself from the solid portion. 
These are the " curds and whey " that result, also, from 
the souring of milk. The whey can be squeezed out of the 



6 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

curd, leaving it quite dry. We have now found at least three 
constituents of milk, — water, fat, and curd. 

You may then surmise from the sweet taste of milk that 
sugar is present; the chemist knows how to obtain it in 
pure form as " sugar of milk." The chemist also finds cer-

tain mineral substances which remain behind when all the 
water is evaporated and the curds and sugar burned away. 
These mineral substances are spoken of by the chemist as 
" ash," because this is what remams after burning the other 
portions of a food material, as ashes remain from a wood fire. 
Figure 1 shows you these substances in the amounts in which 
each occurs in a pint of milk. The sugar is one of a class of 
substances to which the chemist gives the name carbohy- 
drate. To the substance in the curd that is different from 
all the other substances in the milk the name " protein " is 
given. 

We will now turn to the composition of beans, for in beans 
we find food stored up to nourish the young plant, which we, 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 7 

also, appropriate as food. The composition of both the milk 
and the beans is given in this table. Compare also Figures 
35 and 41.

Notice that the substances in the beans are the same in 
general nature as those in the milk, although the amounts are 
dififerent. The water that the young plant needs is, of course, 
supplied from the earth. There is another difference to 
note although this is not shown iuvthe table; in the beans 
the carbohydrate is of two kinds, sugar and starch. 



Foodstuffs ^ 

All the varieties of food with which we are supplied will 
be found to contain some of these substances : protein, fat, 
carbohydrate, mineral matter, water ; and to these we give 
the name foodstuffs. Some food materials (like the milk 
and beans just studied) contain all the foodstuffs, some only 
one, as in the case of sugar. We can now define food as 
something that contains one or more of the substances 
known as foodstuffs. But what are the foodstuffs them- 
selves? 

Elements in the foodstuffs. — Although we are not 
chemists, and may not even have taken a course in chemistry. 



1 Teacher's Note. — The term "foodstufif" is used in place of *'food 
principle," as being the later and better term. 



8 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

yet through our nature study or physiology lessons, we are 
familiar with the fact that all the materials about us, in- 
cluding our own bodies and our food, are made up of simple 
substances that we call " elements." We know, for instance, 
that coal is chiefly carbon, and we are familiar with such sub- 
stances as sulphur, calcium, phosphorus, and iron. We 
^oiow that the air contains oxygen, which we inhale, and 
that we breathe out a combination of carbon and oxygen 
called " carbon dioxide." Since our bodies are composed 
of these and other elements, these elements must be supplied 
by our foods, and therefore, the foodstuffs in turn are com- 
posed of these same elements. 

Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates all contain large amounts 
of carbon, and on this account are called fuel foods. But 
proteins are distinguished because they contain nitrogen in 
addition, which is found in no other foodstuff. Sulphur, 
too, we get only from protein, but we need less of it than of 
nitrogen, so we think about the nitrogen and let the sulphur 
take care of itself. The nitrogen that we draw in from the 
air with every breath, we breathe out again without being 
able to use it. This element is necessary to every living cell, 
but we can make it ours only through our protein food. 
Nitrogen is cheapest when obtained from the grains, from 
dried beans and peas. We pay a higher price for it in milk, 
eggs, fish, meat, and nuts. Carbon, which is found in all 
foodstuffs except water and some kinds of mineral matter, 
costs much less, especially when we take it in the form of 
carbohydrates such as starches and sugars. Oxygen is also 
abundant in our foods, but we get it even more cheaply in 
water and by breathing it in from the air. Phosphorus, 
iron, and calcium are very important elements, but we do 
not need them in very large quantities. We can get them 
cheaply in whole grains, peas and beans, some fruits and 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 9 

green vegetables, but they are worth paying for in milk and 
eggs. The elements last mentioned are present in the food 
partly as constituents of certain proteins and fats, partiy 
as mineral salts. Other elements found as mineral matter 
are sodium and chlorine (which we take as common salt), 
potassium, magnesium, and traces of iodine and fluorine. 
These are all necessary to keep our bodies in good working 
order. We shall see later how to select our food materials 
so as to have all the dififerent elements in the foodstuffs 
present in sufficient amounts. 

Functions of the Foodstuffs 

Food for energy. — The first requirement of the body is 
for fuel, because it has a great deal of work to do. Even 
when one Ues perfectly quiet and appears to be resting, the 
heart is working to keep up the circulation of the blood, the 
chest and diaphragm muscles are working to maintain the 
oxygen supply to the lungs, the alimentary tract is moving 
food material along, working to digest it and get rid of waste, 
and the skeletal muscles are being held up to " tone " so as 
to be ready for further action. All this work that we scarcely 
realize, may be called involuntary. To it we may add all 
sorts of volimtary movements, from simply speaking a word 
to turning somersaults or lifting heavy weights. All work 
involves energy, which we can obtain only from the fuel foods, 
proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 

Energy takes different forms. Our supply comes from the 
sun in the forms of heat and hght, and plants store it up in 
the form of chemical energy when they build carbohydrates, 
fats, and proteins. This may be changed into the forms of 
work or of heat when we eat the food. Whenever an attempt 
is made to change chemical energy to work, some of it will 



10 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

change to heat. So in our bodies, the fuel foods, which 
enable us to do both involuntary and voluntary work, fur- 
nish heat at the same time, to keep our bodies warm. When 
we are too cold, we can shiver or run or jump, and thus, by 
doing more work, get more heat too. 

The unit of fuel value. — - In our studies of food materials, 
we must find out just how much energy, or working power, 
can be obtained from each kind. We must have a measure 
of energy or fuel value ; and just as the inch is a measure of 
length, and the pound of weight, so the Calorie serves as a 
measure of fuel value. This unit ^ measures energy as heat, 
being the amount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of 
water 1° C. (or 1 poimd of water about 4° F.), but we can 
express it also as work, being sufficient energy to raise a 
1-pound weight 3087 feet into the air (or 1 ton about 1| feet) 
if it were possible to convert it into mechanical work without 
loss. By burning foods in pure oxygen in a vessel placed in 
water so that all the heat is given off to the water, and then 
noting the change in temperature of the water, it is possible 
to find out just how much energy each will yield. Such a 
device is called a calorimeter. In the body there is usually a 
small portion of each kind of foodstuff which escapes diges- 
tion, and protein is not quite so completely burned as in the 
calorimeter. When allowance for the probable loss is made, 
the energy values of the fuel foodstuffs are as follows : 

Protein 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound 

Pat 9 Calories per gram or 4082 per pound. 

Carbohydrate .... 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. 

The standard portion. — Knowing the composition of any 
food material, it is possible from these figures to calculate 

* This is the "greater calorie" or "kilogram calorie," and is written 
Calorie to distinguish it from the "lesser calorie" or "gram calorie," largely 
used in physics and chemistry. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 11 

the total fuel value, or we can refer to tables in which this 
has been calculated, and save ourselves labor. For com- 
parison of different foods the Standard, or lOO-Calorie, 
Portion is used, as this corresponds very closely with the 
amount of food 'for a single serving in many cases. In the 
sections treating. of different foods the Standard Portion will 
be stated. 

Food for body building. — Every living cell has a little 
life history of its own, and constantly demands a certain 
amount of .new material to replace old which it has worn out. 
Besides this, old cells die, and new ones have to be made to 
replace them. Hence even a full-grown person needs build- 
mg material, and much more is required in proportion when 
the person is growing and perhaps adding several ounces 
a week to his weight. The foodstuffs which have especial 
value as building material are protein and mineral matter. 

Food for body regulating. — To help in the digestion of 
food, to keep the blood in proper condition, the muscles 
supple, and all the processes of the body at their best, ash 
constituents and water in the diet are necessary. A tabular 
summary of the functions of the foodstuffs and an outline of 
the changes which take place in digestion will be found in the 
appendix. 

We are now able to give a more complete answer to our 
question, " What is Food? '' 

Food has been said to be that which taken into the body 
builds tissue or yields energy, or both. The food as a whole 
must contain all the chemical elements needed by the body, 
these elements being supplied in substances known as food- 
stuffs, viz., protein, fat, carbohydrates, mineral matter or 
ash, water. To be a food, a substance must contain one or 
all of the foodstuffs. 

It must be noted here that our food materials as bought, 



12 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

contain inedible matter, as in the shells of eggs, the bone of 
meat, the skins and pods of vegetables. Moreover, the fiber 
that we eat in vegetable foods is not digested mider ordinary 
circmnstances, but seems rather to serve a useful purpose in 
giving bulk to our foods. 

Food adjuncts. — In preparing foods for the table, we 
have the habit of adding substances to develop or give flavor. 
With the exception of sugar, which we use largely for its 
agreeable taste, these substances have no nutritive value. 
They are not hurtful unless used in excess, although pepper 
and other spices sometimes disturb digestion. Pepper, too, 
irritates a delicate throat. 

Only a few flavors are really detected by the sense of 
taste. These are salt, sugar, acids; and something in the 
spices that gives a sensation hard to describe, but is unmis- 
takable in an overdose of mustard or horse-radish. " Pun- 
gent " is the descriptive word for such a flavor. 

The other flavors are really odors, and are detected by 
the sense of smell. Have you not at some time seemed to 
lose the sense of taste when suffering from a severe cold in 
the head? Yet even then you could taste sugar, salt, 
vinegar, and feel the pungency of pepper. These other 
flavors or odors are due to a volatile oil in the flavoring 
material, that is, an oil that readily evaporates, especially 
when heated, as distinguished from the non-volatile oils and 
fats like olive oil and butter. This is a practical bit of knowl- 
edge in our cookery, for whatever passes off as fragrance 
during the cooking process, is lost as flavor. For instance, 
to cook vanilla essence in a soft custard is equivalent to 
throwing most of it away. 

Salt. — A mineral substance that develops other flavors. It 
should not be used in excess. A small amount is desirable even in 
sweet dishes. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 13 

Adds. — Vinegar, lemon juice, and juices of other sour fruits. 
These are pleasing in themselves, and in small quantities develop 
other flavors and give a certain brightness of taste. They are 
used with meat and fish, and in sweet dishes. 

Spices. — Red, black, and white pepper, cinnamon, cloves, all- 
spice, nutmeg, mace, and ginger are examples. They are made 
from the seeds of certain plants, used whole or ground. Stick cinna- 
mon is a layer of a stem. Ginger is a root. 

Herbs. — Thyme, mint, sweet marjoram, summer savory are 
the leaves of old-fashioned pot herbs, used either fresh or dried. 
There were many others used in olden days that are not common 
now, such as sweet basil and pot marigold. A quite complete list 
win be found nowadays in any good seed catalogue. These herbs 
are used with meat dishes. 

Vegetable flavors. — Celery seeds and stalks, onions, leek and 
garlick, carrots and turnips, all contain flavoring oils, and we use 
them for their flavors in small portions, in meat dishes. 

Essences. — The oils of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon and orange 
peel are dissolved in alcohol, and used in liquid form in cakes and 
desserts. Violet leaves and violet essence are sometimes used, but 
are a fad as a flavor. Rose water made from rose leaves is an old- 
fashioned flavoring, used infrequently now in blancmanges. The 
fresh leaf of a rose geranium gives a pleasing flavor, for occasional 
use. Chocolate, coffee, and tea are used for flavorings as well as for 
beverages. 

Coloring substances. — These come of many colors made from 
aniline dyes, and while probably not often hurtful, they should be 
used only in sweets and candies, and very seldom, if ever. It is 
better to depend on natural fruit coloring when color is wanted. 

The fine art of cooking is to develop the natural flavor of 
each foodstuff by the proper application of heat, and never 
to use these condiments and flavorings in excess. The artist 
in cookery has a gift for flavoring, somewhat as the painter 
has for color. 

Beverages. — The dictionary defines " beverage '' as 
" drink of any kind." The word is used in different forms in 
several languages and is traced back to the Latin bibere^ 



14 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

to drink. The common beverages will be studied in detail 
in connection with their preparation. They have shght 
nutritive value, save for the added milk, cream, and sugar. 
Cocoa and chocolate contain fat, and so have to be classed 
as foods. Milk is not a beverage, strictly speaking, but a 
food, and should be coimted as a part of a meal.

KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 

Thbeb i&no more attractive room than a well-fitted kitchen, 
shining with cleanliness ; and the kitchen furnishings should 
have their fair share of the money spent in buying furniture 
for the house. 

A spotless cleanliness is the standard for the kitchen, and

all the equipment should be selected with the thought of 
making cleanhness easily possible. Next in order is fore- 
thought in securing the comfort and convenience of the 
worker. 



16 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Plan of the kitchen. — Here the motto should be " Save 
-steps," How many weary miles do women walk within their 
kitchen walls because the sink, the stove, the refrigerator 
and the closets for food and dishes are put in to fit the spaces 
allowed by the windows and doors, with no thought of the 
rapid and easy dispatch of work. 

Figure 2 shows the plan of a kitchen, of the " buffet " type, 
suitable for a small home or apartment. As this plan is 
drawn it would be necessary to use either electric apparatus, 



Fia. 3. — Plan of a larger kitchen. 

or a small gas stove upon one of the tables. A large gas 
stove could stand in place of the table at (1), or against the 
wall at (2), pushing the table at (3) nearer the door. The 
cupboards at .(4) and (5) should be raised, leaving table 
space at both the right and left of the sink. Notice that the 
ice box is in the entry, and also that there is a cupboard that 
could be used for food. The china cupboard is conveniently 
near in the dining-room. 

Figure 3 shows a larger kitchen, with a serving room be- 
tween it and the dining-room. The ice box is in the outer 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 17 

wall and is filled from the outside. The cupboard at (1) could 
hold the cooking utensils, as it stands conveniently between 
the sink and the range. A kitchen as large as this should 
have a sm^ll table on rollers for carrying food materials and 
utensils back and forth. If you have ever visited the kitchen 
in a dining-car you will realize that compactness is one 
of the advantages of the small kitchen over the large, although 
the latter may be better ventilated and cooler. 

Furnishing the kitchen. — The walls and floors, and even 
the ceiUng, should be washable. A tiled wall is as easy to 
wash as a china dish, but the expense is prohibitive in many 
cases. Table oilcloth for wall and ceihng is very satis- 
factory ; next to this in desirability is paint, and for the last 
choice a washable paper. This paper will bear scarcely 
more than a damp cloth for cleansing purposes, however. 
Avoid cracks and crevices in the woodwork, having all 
surfaces as plain as possible. 

The best floor is one covered with an inlaid Unoleum, 
which gives warmth and comfort to the foot, is easy to clean, 
and wears for many years (Fig. 4). It should be cemented 
down at the edges that no dust may collect. The first cost 
is rather high, but it pays in the end. A hardwood floor of 
maple or yellow pine is also satisfactory. Tiling is the 
cleanest of all floorings, but is very fatiguing to the worker. 

Enamel-paint makes a smooth finish for the woodwork. 
In the kitchen of the future, which will be fireproof, steel 
fittings will probably take the place of all wood. 

Have harmonious colors in the kitchen. Decide upon a 
cheerful color scheme, and carry it out in all the fittings. 
One most attractive kitchen is furnished in soft brown and 
bufiF, with a touch of blue in the linoleum on the floor. Figure 
4 shows the interior of a small kitchen, practical for a family 

of six or eight. The curtain at the window, which gives a

touch of daintiness, is of a washable material. Figure 5 shows 
a much larger kitchen, with two sinks, and a work-table in 
the center. See how conveniently the refrigerator is placed for 
serving, and for retiu*ning food from the serving room to the

refrigerator. The vegetable sink is near the stove, and the 
utensils, too, are near by, A rolling table is seen at the left. 
No plan can be drawn that would be perfect in all situations. 
If you ever have the opportunity to plan your own kitchen, 
decide just what you want it to contain, and then plan the 
places for each article. Sometimes there are too many drawers 
and shelves, and these not of the right size or position. 



20 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The kitchen table. — The table should have a top with 
room for food materials and utensils to stand in neat order 
without crowding. Glass is the cleanest top, painted steel 
and hard maple coming next in order. Have some arrange- 
ment of shelves and drawers that small utensils and some food 
materials may be always at hand. Figure 6 shows a kitchen 
" cabinet " of painted steel with such conveniences. Notice 
the bin for flour, and the inverted jar for sugar, both with an 
opening at the bottom. Spices and flavorings and materials 
needed in small quantities are kept in jars on the shelves. 
The cupboard and drawers beneath will hold small utensils, 
towels, and whatever proves to be needed close by. Several 
makes of such cabinets are now on sale. A flat-topped table 
for a large kitchen, Fig. 5, could have drawers and cup- 
boards below. If the outlay for a cabinet seems too great, 
the bins for sugar and flour may be purchased separately 
and fastened on the wall above the table, and one or two 
shelves screwed on the wall for the jars, with hooks fastened 
in underneath on which a few small utensils may be hung. 

A small rolling table may be made inexpensively by putting 
castors on a Ught table costing not more than a dollar. Put 
table oilcloth over the top. This is a great convenience in 
many ways. The height of the table should be such that the 
worker is not fatigued by bending over. Thirty-two inches 
is a good table height for a woman of five feet four or five 
inches. Blocks hollowed to fit the table legs may be used 
with a table of ordinary height for a tall person. 

Cupboards and shelves. — If you purchase a cupboard 
see that the shelves are movable, and of varjdng widths. 
There are a few large utensils that need a deep shelf, about 
fifteen inches. If the shelves are to be built in, provide several 
widths from six to ten inches. Much space is sometimes 
wasted between shelves. Vary the distances here. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 21 

Smooth paint is the best surface for the shelf. Shelf 
covers of paper or oilcloth look clean when they are fresh, but 



are less sanitary than uncovered shelves. Drawers should 
not be too lai^e, for these are heavy to pull and push when 



22 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

full. Cupboard shelves are oa the whole more satisfactory 
than drawers, because this tiresome pulliag out and pushing 
in are avoided. Towels can be piled on the shelves, and 
small utensils hung on right- 
angled screw hooks. Do not 
use curved hooks, except for 
hanging cups from the bottom 
of a shelf. 

The refrigerator. — A good 
refrigerator is built with 
double walb, and has several 
layers of non-conducting ma^ 
terial. Figure 7 shows the 
careful way in which the 
refrigerator wall is made.

the house, make sure that it is properly trapped (Fig. 8) . See 
" Shelter and Clothing," page 51, for description of the S trap. 
The closets for the food should have an enamel or tiled 
lining. This is non-absorptive, and may be kept perfectly 
clean. A large refrigerator is more economical of ice than a

box, painted outside and in, the opening toward the window 
having a curtain of table oilcloth. A piece of wire netting 
Bet in one aide of the box permits of a current of air. 

The sink. — White enameled iron and porcelain are the 
most desirable materials for the sink. A simply constructed 
sink is shown in Fig. 10. Notice that the sink is supported 
from the wall, leavii^ a free space underneath. A larger 



Fio. 10. —A aink of simplf 

sink is shown in Fig, 11, with the draining board in the aink. 
The trap below the sink should be a large S trap, and 
the trap and faucets should be nickel plate. 

An iron sink should be rubbed and polished until it becomes 
very smooth. Do not attempt to p^nt it. If it is left 
perfectly dry, it will not rust. 

Hot water supply. — A good supply is essential to rapid 
and thorough work. The apartment dweller who finds it 
piped to the sink is most fortunate. The separate house 
must have a boiler connected with the coal range, or a water 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 25 

tank fastened to the range. If gas ia used, have some kmd 
of gas water heater that will give a sufficient flow for dish- 
washing and cleaning purposes. A boiler may be heated 
with a kerosene stove. The boiler should be fastened above 
the floor with space below for a one-burner blue flame kero-

sene stove. Have a faucet in the boiler. Wherever a boiler 
is used it is economy to have it covered with some non- 
conducting material, just as steam pipes are packed. 

Utensils. — The expert cook is known by the small number 
of utensils that she uses. If you watch the expert at work, 
you will see too, that each utensil is exactly fitted to its use. 

The skilled cook is like the carpenter or painter, and her 
set of tools is individual. The list given on page 28 is a 
sample one, to be changed to suit the individual preference, 
and increased as the need arises; it could be smaller, if 



' 



26 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

necessary. When you first furnish a kitchen, avoid an 
elaborate display of tools, beginning with the few essentials 
only. 

No one material is suitable for the construction of all 
utensils. Those subjected to intense heat must be of material 
able to resist it. The material for a given utensil must be se- 
lected with the purpose of the utensil in mind. The material 
should be durable, easy to clean, and of such a nature that 
it does not affect chemically the food material cooked in it. 

Aluminium, — A white metal, fairly durable, very light in weight. 
Discolors easily, and is not easy to clean. Expensive. Used for all 
kinds of utensils. 

Copper. — Endures heat, durable, fairly light to handle. Hard 
to keep clean. Expensive. Used for kettles. Not desirable for 
family use. 

Earthenware. — Will not endure the highest temperatures with- 
out crackling. Easily breakable. Easy to clean, unless crackled. 
Inexpensive. Useful for slow oven processes, for pitchers and mix- 
ing bowls. 

Enamel. — A vitrified material upon iron or steel. The English 
enamel ware upon iron is durable, excellent for preserving, heavy. 
The German and American enamels are lighter. Avoid the attrac- 
tive blue, and blue and white except for pitchers, cups, bowls, and 
plates. They crackle and chip off more easily with heat then the 
gray enamels. One German make, of a dark mottled gray, is less 
brittle in the finish than most American makes. All the enamels 
are easy to keep clean. Used for kettles, saucepans, roasting, 
and baking. Less durable than steel and iron. 

Iron. — Endures intense heat. Durable. Heavy to handle. 
Becomes smooth with long use, and then is not difficult to clean. 
Affects the color of acid fruits. Not expensive. Used for frying 
kettles and pans and kettles for boiling. 

Russia iron is a sheet iron of good quality for roasting and 
bread pans. Expensive. 

Steel. — Endures intense heat. Durable. Medium weight. 
Fairly easy to clean. Affects acid fruits. Medium cost. Same 
uses as iron, also for roasting and baking pans, and smaller kettles. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 27 

Tin. — Tin, a " useful metal," is plated on thin sheet iron for 
utensils. So called block tin is the best quality. Will not endure 
intense heat. The tin wears and scratches off with use. Not 
easy to clean. Discolors easily, and colors acid fruit. Poor tin 
ware is not worth bujdng. Good quality is not cheap. May be 
used for measures, and for small saucepans, but is less desirable 
than other wares. 

Wooden ware, — Used for molding boards, meat boards, and 
spoons. 

The patterns of utensils. — Select those made without 
seams, or flutings, where food particles collect. Bowls, 
saucepans, and kettles should have a lip on the side, for the 
pouring out of liquids. A pitcher should be of such shape 
that it can be easily washed, and it should have a lip that 
will pour well. A pot for boiling coffee should have a lip 
and not a spout. Select utensils with non-conducting 
handles. 

Study carefully the selection of knives, and do not try to 
economize in their purchase. Knives must be sharp, and 
poor quality steel will never take a good edge. A worn table 
knife of Sheffield steel, when ground down, makes the best of 
kitchen knives. Buy a good sharpener and use it frequently. 

Labor-saving devices. — A good machine saves the wear 
and tear of human muscle, and also much time. If you have 
studied the principles of the lever and other mechanical 
devices, you will understand why this is.^ 

Learn to pay for, use, and clean good machines. 

A " Dover " egg beater is built on the principle of the 
" wheel and axle.'' The large wheel has five times as many

of the "wheel and axle," or the windlass, or both. The mechanical advan<

cogs as the small, one revolution of the large wheel giving 
five of the small, and one turn of the handle five revolutions 
of the blades. It saves your wrist, and saves time to use the 
" Dover " in place of a fork. It is more trouble to wash the

Dover beater than the fork. Yet a cook may object to a 
bread mixer and meat chopper, because they are harder to 
clean than the bowl and spoon and knife, 

A good bread mixer aaves strength and is sanitary. Fig. 12. 

A meat chopper or grinder also saves strength and time, 
and is cleaner than the wooden chopping bowl.

Care of the kitchen. — The daily cleaning must include 
the care of the sink and traps, the cleaning of the stove, 
brushing the floor, and washing off of tables. More thorough 
cleaning includes the scrubbing of the floor, washing of walls, 
woodwork, and windows, cleaning of closets and drawers. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 31 

The stoves should be rubbed often with paper, and washed 
thoroughly when necessary. Great pains must be taken to 
keep the ovens clean, by frequent washing out. Gas burners 
must be taken off and boiled in a solution of sal soda 
once in a while. The top and bottom of coal ovens should 
be cleaned out once a month. Kerosene stoves need con- 
stant cleaning. Stove blacking makes the stove more 
attractive. 

Dish-washing. — It is not difficult to wash dishes well, 
although many people make it a very disagreeable process. 
The necessary apparatus is given in the utensil Kst. The 
cleansing materials include a plentiful supply of hot water, 
a good soap, ammonia or borax to soften the water, a gritty 
soap or powder. Have a pan for washing and another for 
rinsing, and a tray for draining if there is no drainer attached 
to the sink. 

Order of work. — Prepare the dishes by scraping and neatly 
piling articles of a kind together. Rub greasy dishes with soft 
paper, and put water and ammonia or washing powder into utensils 
that need soaking. Have clean towels at hand. Make ready a 
pan of hot soap suds, by using a soap shaker, or soap solution, but 
do not put the cake of soap in the pan. Have rinsing water ready. 

Wash the cleanest dishes first, usually the glasses, next the cups 
and saucers, and the silver next. Have the soiled dishes near the 
pan, and put in only one or two articles at a time, washing with 
mop or dish cloth. To pile in a number means the nicking of 
china, and scratching of silver. Dip each dish in the rinsing water 
and then put in the drainer. If there is not room for two pans, 
the dishes may be piled on the drainer not too many at a time, 
and the rinsing water poured over. Be careful not to use too hot 
water for delicate china and glass. Change the soapy water when 
it becomes in the least greasy. 

Wipe the dishes while they are still warm, and use dry towels. 

Wash the utensils thoroughly, especially on the bottom. Heavy 
utensils can be dried without wiping, on or near the stove. Do 
not put any utensils away until they are perfectly dry. 



32 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Steel knives should be scoured and thoroughly rinsed and 
dried. Wash out the towels and dishpan, and leave the sink and 
drainboard perfectly clean. It does take time and work for this 
whole process, but spotless cleanliness is our aim.^ 

Home dish-washers are being devised, and should save some of 
the labor. None as yet has proved very satisfactory.

CHAPTER III 

^ FUEL AND STOVES 

The fuels most widely used in this country are coal, gas, 
and kerosene. Wood is still used for cooking by those who 
own wood lots, or who Kve in a district where wood is abun- 
dant, but in a sense it is the fuel of the past. Electricity is 
generated from coal except in the few communities where 
the electric cmrent is derived through machinery from the 
energy of falling water but electricity is not in common 
household use, and is still the method of the future for the 
average family. Other substances are burned for fuel 
occasionally or in restricted localities. Com cobs are used 
sometimes in the corn belt. Peat is an old-world fuel. 
It is a vegetable substance taken in blocks from marshes, 
in reality the first stage of coal formation. It is a slow-burning 
fuel which is cheap in its own locality. 

Economy of fuel is a world problem, for it is evident that 
the coal supply will be exhausted in course of time, and this 
is true also of coal oil or petroleum. Scientists are experi- 
menting to discover practical methods, not dependent upon 
the burning of coal, for generating electricity. Water power 
is the only practicable method so far, and to make it per- 
manently available we must conserve the forests still remain- 
ing to us, and thus safeguard the sources of our rivers. 

Another effort toward economy is seen in the use for fuel 

of waste products treated in some way to make them readily 

combustible. The briquet is used in Europe where the fuel 

supply is limited. It is made of sawdust or waste coal, with 

D 33 



34 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

some petroleum, tar, resin, or other substance, heated together 
and molded. Good briquets yield a large amount of heat in 
proportion to bulk and weight. The problem here, as with 
all waste, is to find a manufacturing process that will make 
the product cheap enough to be practical for conunon 
use. 

It is a natural impulse to use lavishly whatever is at hand 
in abundance, and it is only a highly civilized conununity 
that takes thought for the economy of the future. Con- 
sidered only from a selfish point of view, however, with coal 
and petroleum at the high prices that are likely to prevail, 
the saving of fuel is one of our most important economies. 

The common fuels. — Coal is of two kinds, anthracite 
and bituminous, or hard and soft. Hard coal of good quality 
has 90 per cent or more of carbon, and burns with little 
flame. Soft coal contains as much as 18 per cent of flame- 
making substances, and gives off a heavy smoke. Hard 
coal is therefore cleaner, but it is more costly than soft coal, 
because the supply is smaller. The most important anthra- 
cite mines are found in the eastern United States, and hard 
coal is used more in this section than elsewhere. Good hard 
coal may be recognized by its glossy black color and bright 
surfaces. It is sold under different names taken often from 
the locality where it is mined. There are two kinds, one 
leaving a reddish ash, and the other a white. The red ash 
coal bums more freely than the white ash and the ash is 
heavier and therefore cleaner. The price is higher per ton 
or bag. 

Coai is sorted in different sizes, a medium size being best 
for the ordinary range. Poor coal has slaty pieces in it, 
that will not bum but break up and mingle with the ashes. 
You can learn to detect it by the slaty color. Clinkers are 
formed by unbumable minerals, mixed with the coal, that 



FUEL AND STOVES 36 

melt and stick together, and even adhere to the lining or the 
grate. They are not often troublesome in the cooking range. 

Coal is measured by the ton of two thousand pounds avoir- 
dupois. A conunon hod of coal holds about thirty pounds. 
Coal should be bought in large quantity, and stored away 
in summer, if possible. The retail dealer in the city often 
charges an exorbitant simi for coal by the bag, so that the 
buyer of small quantities pays a much higher price for a ton 
bought in this way. The wholesale price of coal has 
increased on an average about 13 per cent since 1900. 

Coke is the sohd substance remaining after gas has been 
made from certain kinds of poal, and is sometimes sold by 
gas compaiiies, as a by-product. It is Kght, and therefore 
easy to handle and does not smoke, but it burns out quickly, 
and the fire of coke requires frequent replenishing. It is 
sold by the bag, or in large quantities by the ton, also some^ 
times by the chaldron, an old English measure for coal, 
containing from thirty-two to thirty-six bushels. 

Gas was used for illuminating long before it came into 
conamon use for heating and cooking. Conmiercial gas 
manufactured for both lighting and cooking is really a mix- 
ture of various gases. One method produces it from bitu- 
minous coal heated in retorts. Another method gives 
" water gas," by passing steam through heated coal. The 
value of gas will depend upon the components of the mixture, 
and the manufacturer has an opportunity to make ah in- 
ferior gas unless the law stipulates what the quality shall 
be. 

The small town or country dweller may use a gas machine 
on the premises, the gas to be stored or generated in some 
tank in the ground, and piped into the house. Acetylene, 
a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is used in this way. 
Acetylene has a low flashing point, and there is question as to 



36 



FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



its safety. One firm sends a mixed gas of good quality in 
metal bottles to the consumer, the bottles being placed in a 
metal closet above ground outside the house. The firm 
claims that an explosion has never occurred. 

Gas is measured by the cubic foot, and its price estimated 
per 1000 cubic feet. The amount is recorded on a meter as 
the gas passes into the house. See Fig. 13. It is an easy 
matter to learn to read a meter, and every one should do so

who uses gas. Always compare the gas bill with the amount 
recorded by the meter. If the gas bill becomes larger than 
usual, and you feel sure that the consumption has been nor- 
mal, report the matter to the company. A meter may be 
out of order, and need repair. 

To redd the meter, — Figure 13 shows the three dials found 
on the face of a gas meter. The arrows show the direction. 
The dial at the right indicates 100 cubic feet between the 
numbers, the middle dial 1000 and the left hand dial 10,000. 
The dials in this figure record 53,250 cubic feet. The price 
of gas varies from eighty cents to a dollar and a half per 
thousand cubic feet. " Eighty-cent gas " is the hope of many 
a consumer. At a dollar and a half it is not a cheap fuel. 



FUEL AND STOVES 37 

Gas does away with the handhng of coal and ashes in the 
kitchen and is thus a clean and labor-saving fuel. It gives 
an intense heat the moment the flame is lighted and this heat 
is easily regulated in a well-made stove. The flame should 
bum with a clear blue or greenish color. With a properly 
constructed stove only a small percentage of the heat is lost. 
In all these points it has the advantage over coal. The 
comparative cost is studied in the problems on page 53. 

Natural gas is used in those regions where it occurs, piped 
to the house from a central source. It is found in limited 
areas only, and in some places has already been exhausted. 

Coal oil, or petroleum, sometimes found oozing from crevices 
in rocks, or even floating on water, is a natural inflammable 
oil stored in the earth. It was known in ancient Persia, 
Greece, and Rome, but did not become of great commercial 
importance until the middle of the nineteenth century. It is 
now obtained by boring wells, and is found in great quantities 
in certain regions of the country. The crude oil yields many 
products valuable in the arts, medicine, and manufacture. 
Kerosene is the substance useful as a fuel and for giving 
light. When of good quality it is nearly colorless, and the 
flashing point should be 149° F., or 65° C. This flashing 
point is the temperature at which the vapor from the kero- 
sene explodes or flashes. If the vapor flashes at *a point 
lower than this, it means that the oil has not been suffi- 
ciently refined ; that is, in the process of manufacture the 
substances that flash at a low temperature have not been 
removed, and therefore the oil is less safe. 

Kerosene is sold by the gallon or barrel. The price for a 
good quality is about seventy cents for a five-gallon can. 
By the barrel a saving is made of several cents a gallon. It 
is useful as a fuel to those housekeepers who cannot have 
gas, and who find it a convenient substitute for coal in the 



38 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

summer. With the new blue flame stoves it gives an intense 
heat, easily regulated. There is no heavy labor involved 
in its use, but even the best stove requires constant care and 
watchfulness. It is not so clean and easy to use as gas. The 
kerosene supply should be kept in a cool place, and stoves 
and lamps should never be filled by candle or lamplight. 

Gasolene is used as a fuel for cooking in some places, but 
in others the fire insurance companies have such strict rules 
in regard to it that its use is practically prohibited. It is 
more volatile than kerosene, and its flashing point is very 
low. Kerosene is much safer for household use. 

Alcohol is used with the chafing dish. Denatured alcohol 
is so cheap in Germany that it is used in large and especially 
adapted stoves for cooking purposes. There are denatured 
alcohol stoves on the market here, but they are little used. 

Charcoal, wood partially burnt out, is little used for do- 
mestic purposes now. 

The relative value of the common fuels is stated in quan- 
tities as follows, but this is of course dependent on the quality 
of the coal and the gas. One thousand feet of gas about 
equals from fifty to sixty pounds of coal, or four and one half 
gallons of kerosene ; and one half ton of coal approximates 
a cord of wood. 

4 

Those who may be interested will find a fuller discussion 
of fuels and fuel values in SnelFs " Elementary Household 
Chemistry.'' 

Electricity is not a fuel, but is classed here as a source of 
heat. It may be supplied for cooking purposes by any com- 
pany that furnishes electric light, and should be available 
in the country wherever an electric trolley runs. The energy 
supplied is measured and paid for by the kilowatt ; that is, 
one thousand watts. The terms used for electrical measure- 
ments cannot be really understood until one has studied 



FUEL AND STOVES 39 

electricity. It may be said, however, that the ampere ^ is 
the unit of current strength, the volt is the unit of electrical 
pressure or electromotive force, the watt is the unit of elec- 
trical power and the basis of payment for current suppKed 
for heating or lighting. 

Voltage, amperage, and watt or kilowatt are the terms 
in common use. If you read the circulars that advertise 
electric cooking apparatus, you will find the request to state 
the voltage of your electric current in ordering a piece of 
apparatus. Or again, the nimiber of watts used per hour is 
given, with the catalogue number and the size of an electric 
stove. 

The cost of electricity per kilowatt (usually from ten to 
fifteen cents) varies in different localities. 

The great advantage of electricity is that little heat is 
lost in radiation, and that the degree of heat is well under 
control. There are also^ no products of combustion present, 
and this is the only source of heat for cooking of which this 
is true. Both gas and kerosene vitiate the air to some extent. 

Cooking apparatus. — The wastefulness of cooking opera- 
tions, past and present, is due largely to the defects of the 
apparatus used. The open fireplace for wood, and the open 
grate for coal, are two arrangements that permit most of 
the heat to pass up the chinmey, and into the room. See 
Frontispiece and Fig. 14. In Fig. 14 there is illustrated at 
the right a brick oven with a flue opening into the chimney. 
This was one of the earliest inventions for saving fuel and 
heat. This oven was lined with brick or stone, and the fire 
of wood was built in it, and allowed to remain until it had

work in electricity. Volta was an Italian who invented an electric battery ; 
Ampere was a French electrician; and Watt a Scottish engineer and 
electrician.

burned out. The coals and ashes were removed, and when 
the brick had cooled somewhat cakes and pies were put in 
to bake. This oven retained its heat for twenty-four hours, 
and beans put in Saturday afternoon were taken out hot for 
the Sunday morning breakfast. The method was clumsy, 
but a good heat saver. 



Fio. 14. — A colonial Greplftoe. 

Figure 15 is an American stove, early nineteenth century, 
wood the fuel ; and from this form, modified for using coal, 
has developed the modem American coal range (Fig. 18). 
Even the latest types are very wasteful of heat. Stoves 
like that shown in Fig. 19 have been devised for use with 
gas. Even with these only a small percentage of the heat 
generated is available for cooking. 

The ideal system is that which gives the largest possible 
percentage of its heat for cooking, and puts the degree of 



PVEL AND STOVES 41

and of labor in operating. This does not mean that the 



Covlay of lAe Brj/iov

stove which gives the most intense heat is the best, although 
some stoves seem to be constructed with that as the aim. 

Let us consider some of the methods of saving heat, and 
study different kinds of apparatus with this knowledge in mind. 



42 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We recall the f9;Ct, first, that some substances are good 
conductors of heat, and others poor.^ If you hold a metal 
poker in your hand, and place the other end in red hot coals, 
you will realize that metal is a rapid conductor of heat. If 
the poker has a wooden handle, the heat of the coals does 
not readily reach your hand, for the wood is a poor conductor. 
Moreover, this good conductor is a poor holder of heat, the 
heat radiating rapidly from it into the surrounding air, but 
the poor conductor, once thoroughly heated, cools off slowly. 

You can think of many illustrations from your daily life. Why 
do you prefer a woolen blanket on a cool night, rather than a linen 
sheet, merely ? Why do you use a cloth holder in ironing ? What 
is the principle of a hot water bottle ? Air is a poor conductor. Can 
you think of an illustration of this? What is the principle of a 
thermos bottle ? 

Ijb is not difficult to see how these facts apply in our cooking 
apparatus. From an oven with metal sides heat is lost by 
radiation. In a double oven, with an air space between 
the inner and outer part, som^ heat is saved. If the outer 
cover is of some non-conducting material, even less radiation 
takes place. This is the principle of the oven devised by 
Mr. Edward Atkinson. Here the inner oven is of sheet 
iron, and the outer covering of a- non-conducting material, 
some composition with wood pulp or paper as the basis. If 
in this way heat can be trapped, as it were, in an oven, it 
will follow that less heat will have to be supplied, and we can 
use a smaller amount of fuel. This is the case in the Atkin- 
son oven (Fig. 16), where the source of heat is either a kero- 
sene lamp, or a small Bunsen burner of the rose type, which 
uses only a small amount of gas.

throughout the whole topic of apparatus and cooking processes.

Another illustration of the conserving of heat by the pre- 
vention of radiation is in the fireless cooker. This is a method 
used in Sweden in simple form, and adapted and improved 
to suit modem needs. Heat is supplied in the first place by 
gas or kerosene, and the water in the vessel containing the 
food is raised to the boiling point, and held there in some 
cases for a few minutes. The vessel is then placed in the 
" cooker," which is a box with thick walls of some non-con- 
ducting material, and the heat already 
present is sufficient to finish the cook- 
ing process, since the radiation is very 
slow. In some cookers a heated stone 
is introduced to raise the temperature 
slightly. Both of these devices are ex- 
cellent for the long, slow cooking that 
seems to mellow the food material and 
develop the flavors that do not result 
from rapid cooking. 

At the same time, we need rapid pro- 
cesses, such as broiling and toasting, 
which give characteristic flavors. To 
meet this double need, a new type of 

gas stove has been made. See Fig 17. ^'''' ^®~oken^*^'''*''' 

This is a gas stove, where the oven 
has thick walls of a non-conducting material. The oven is 
heated, for a short time only, the gas flame being cut off when 
the oven has reached the desired temperature. At the left 
is an attachment where rapid cooking may be accomplished 
when desired, and there is a device at (1) with the same prin- 
ciple as the fireless cooker, or the tea '' cosey." This cover is 
dropped over the kettle when the boiling point is reached, the 
flame is turned out, and the heat in the water finishes the 
process. There is no good reason why stoves embodying 




44 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

this same principle should not be used with kerosene, and 
with the electric current. Improved stoves of this type will 
be constructed, and ceri^ainly will tend toward great economy 
of fuel. 

One method of saving fuel is by the use of a steam cooker, 
which consists of a series of compartments, one above an- 



Coarlat i^Domaitc Eitttpnumi Co,

other, containing several kinds of food, all to be cooked over 
the same burner, either gas or kerosene, or on one section of 
the top of the coal range when space is being used for the 
wash boiler or irons. 

It requires intelligence to use such devices, and those who 
lack it cling obstinately to hot fires and violent cooking. 



FUEL AND STOVES 45 

The coal range. — Progress is slow, and the coal range 
will not be abolished at present. Figure 18 is an example of 
a good range as easy to manage as possible. The coal box 
at (1) has a lining that prevents the iron from burning out. 
The air enters at (2) and passes out at (3), when the fire is 
first made. When it is necessary to heat the oven, a damper 



Caaraty 14 Datait suae workt. 
Fia. 18. — A modem coal range. 

is closed at (4), and the heated air then passes around the 
oven in the direction of the arrows. The coal is put in at 
(5) and the ashes shaken down at (6). Larger ranges, resting 
upon the floor, have a " dump " for the ashes directly into 
the ash box in the cellar, and some makes have a device for 
operatii^ this with the foot. The coal stove involves the 



46 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

labor of bringing in coal and taking out ashee^ and space 
must be given to the coal bin and ash pit. A range of this 
size would serve for a family of five or six. It requires from 
2 to 3 hods per day. A hood should be placed above a large 
range, whether coal or gas. 

To make a coal fire. — See that the grate is clean and that the 
ashes have been removed. You know that a current of air con- 
taining oxygen is needed to make the fire bum. How will you 
arrange the damper at (2) and (3) when you are starting the fire ? 

Coal does not begin to burn easily. Therefore we kindle it by 
materials that have a low kindling temperature, light wood, paper, 
and matches. 

In the bottom of the grate, lay twisted pieces of paper, or very 
finely split pieces of wood, or shavings, next in order larger pieces 
of wood laid ** crisscross," yet close enough not to let the coal fall 
through, and on the top a shovelful or two of coal. Why do you 
not put in flat newspapers, and lay the kindling lengthwise and 
solid? Put on the stove lids, arrange the dampers properly, and 
touch the match. Why do you use the match? Why does the 
match light? Perhaps your nature study lessons will help you to 
explain this whole kindling process. 

What should be the next step in the fire making? How should 
you finally arrange the dampers ? 

A coal fire will keep well for a considerable length of time, if the 
coal is put on and the ash removed regularly, provided the stove is 
well constructed, and the coal of good quality. Add fresh coal 
before the fire becomes a dull red, and shows ashes. If it gets too 
low, wood kindling will be needed, and this is poor management. 
Be careful not to put in so much coal that you cannot put the lid 
on firmly. It ruins the top of a stove if the hot coals touch it. 

Soot must be removed once in a while from the top and bottom 
of the oven, and from the stove pipe. 

The gas stove. — Figure 19 shows a well-constructed stove 
of the usual type. Notice the air space, and asbestos lining 
around the oven. The burner for heating the oven is at (1). 
Holes in the sides allow the heated air to pass outside of the 



FUEL AND STOVES 47 

oven at (2) and into the oven as indicated by the arrows. 
The heated current passes out of the oven at the back of the 
top, and passes out of the stove at (3), where it should be 
carried away by a pipe into a flue. The heat of the oven

The gas burner (Fig. 20} is constructed on the principle 
of the Bunsen burner, which you may have used in the labora- 
tory. There is an opening in the pipe, near the stopcock, 
which admits the air, that it may mix with the gas, and give 
the blue flame. If there is not enough air, the ilame burns 
with a yellow color, and smokes. If there is too much air, 
there is a roaring sound, and the Flame "pulls back" and 
burns with a smoky yellow flame, and disagreeable odor, 

There is a valve always to r^- 

ulate the air supply for each 
burner. Figure 20 shows a 
burner removed from the range. 
(1) is the hollow, star-shaped 
chamber which gives space for 
the thorough mixing of the gas 
with the air. The gas enters 
from the connecting pipe at

air supply. 

Gas ranges of this type are built in different sizes, and 
with varying arrangements of ovens and hot-closets. An 
oven above the stove is convenient. Ranges are built also 
for using either gas or coal. A range of the size pictured, 
with four large burners on the top, will serve for a family of 
five or six, if the work is well planned. The oven burner 
consumes 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the top burners 
2 cubic feet each, and the simmering burner somewhat 
less. This is estimated for a burner turned on full. 

To manage a gas stove. — Before lightii^ the top or oven burners 
see that the stopcocks are all tight, with no escaping gas. To 
light the top bumers, strike the match, turn on the stopcock, and 
touch the match to the gas when it is flowing well. A disaffreeable 



FUEL AND STOVES 49 



(( 



popping " follows if the match is applied to the burner before 
the gas flows. For lighting the oven, a " leader " burner at the 
side of the stove acts as a taper. Open the oven doors, and the 
door below, strike the match, turn on the leader, and light it, turn 
on the back burner, and then the front burner, and turn out the 
leader. The so-called explosion of a gas stove is due to the sudden 
lighting of a quantity of gas under the oven that has collected with- 
out being lighted. 

The important point in managing a gas stove is to keep the stop- 
cock turned so that the flame is low. The full flame is needed only 
when water is being brought to the boiling point, and for the first 
heating of the oven. The low flame should be protected from 
draft. Many gas stoves now have a small simmering burner 
that is more useful than the large burner. Another i)oint in the 
use of the stove is the prevention of the ** boiling over '* from some 
kettle. The low flame helps here, and it is also necessary that the 
kettles should not be too full. " Boiling over " clogs the burners, 
and makes necessary the frequent cleaning of the pan underneath 
the burners. 

The oven burner should be lighted from five to ten minutes be- 
fore the oven is wanted, depending upon the intensity of the flames. 
After the food has been put in the oven, allow a few minutes, not 
more than five, for the food to heat through, and then turn the 
flame as low as possible. Often, one burner can be turned out. 
This you have to learn by experience. When toasting or broiling 
is the process, light the oven burner before using, because the work 
is performed by the heated iron as well as by the gas flame. Leave 
the lower door open, as bread toasts or meat broils, to hasten the 
browning process, for it is the oxygen of the air that causes the 
browning. Some coal ovens have a damper for admitting air for 
this same purpose and though some flavor is lost in this way by 
evaporation, the amount is negligible in a quick cooking process. 
The Atkinson oven is so tightly closed, that food does not acquire 
a rich brown in it. An opening at the top is available when a deli- 
cate brown is wanted. It is true, however, that the slow process 
with a minimum of evaporation gives a flavor that compensates for 
the brown color and flavor. All burners should be removed if 
the holes seem clogged and be boiled out in a solution of washing 
soda, two tablespoonfuls to a gallon of water. Do not blacken the 
burners.

Kerosene stoves. — The best type is a blue-flame stove 
with a wick. Kerosene stoves are made with no wick, the 
kerosene being vaporized just before it reaches the burner, 
but such a stove requires occasional pumping to force the 
kerosene into the vaporizing chamber, and on the whole is 
less satisfactory than the stove with the wick. The heat is 
intense from this blue flame, and the burner is economical of 
the fuel. The small kerosene stoves, burning with a yellow 
flame are always inclined to smoke, and difficult to keep 
clean. A three- or four-burner oil stove with a portable oven 
will do the cooking in summer for a family of five or six. 
One burner consumes a gallon of oil in 15 hours. Portable 
double ovens are furnished with such stoves. 

The kerosene stove is cheaper to operate than a gas range, 
even with kerosene at fourteen cents a gallon, but the heat 
is not under such perfect control, and the stove requires more 
work to keep it clean. 

The one important point in the management of this bliie-flame 
wick stove is to keep the flame down by having the wiok low, and 
where it belongs. The cylinder around the burner prevents the 
escai)e of heat and carries it to the utensil above. A careless 
I)erson, by raising the wick too high, and producing a yellow smoky 
flame, makes much trouble for herself. It is important to fill the 
tank without spilling a drop of kerosene, and to keep every part 
of the stove well washed off with soap and water. The wick should 
be rubbed off occasionally, never cut, and if an odor becomes per- 
ceptible, the burner should be taken apart and boiled in a solution 
of washing soda and water. The wick will need to be renewed at 
intervals, depending upon the amount of use that it has. With 
care a stove of this kind is clean and odorless. 

Electric apparatus. — Figure 21 shows a table arranged 
for cooking by electricity, each piece of apparatus having its 
own connection. Compare this with the frontispiece, the 
method of cooking in the eighteenth century, and you will

realize how far we have prc^essed in the way of convenience, 
comfort, and heat economy. Figure 22 shows a disk stove 
four and a half inches in diameter, upon which a saucepan

may stand, and which is therefore available for more than 
one purpose. 

The advantages of electric cooking are obvious. The heat 
is directly conducted to each utensil, and a minimum amount 
is lost in radiation. The degree of heat is perfectly under 
control, and the manipulation is nothing more than the 
turning of a knob. When the apparatus is installed, it is 
adjusted to the volt^e, so that no further regulation ia 



52 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

necessary. There are no waste products, and no matches to 
light or throw away. If the wiring is properly done, there ia 
no danger from fire. The one present disadvantage is the 
cost. Each piece of apparatus is expensive. The cost of 
running must depend upon the cost of electricity in the neigh- 
borhood, and the number of watts per hour used by each 
piece of apparatus. The larger the utensil, the more watts 
consumed. The disk stove in Fig, 22 uses 250 watts ; a disk 
of 6 inches diame- 
ter, 475 watts; of 
8 inches, 650 watte. 
Some pieces of ap- 
paratus are ar- 
ranged for three 
different heats, 
with a different 
number of watts 
for each heat. With 
one disk stove 10 inches in diameter, 3 heats are possible, 
with 250, 500, and 1000 watts respectively. 

Oven thermometers. ^ A thermometer is furnished set 
in the door of many ranges. While these are guides after 
one has learned to use the oven, they are not really accurate 
by scale. For exact work in testing oven temperature, a 
hole must be bored in the side of the oven, and a chemical 
thermometer inserted, protected by asbestos and metal. 

Simple teste for oven temperature will be found in Chapter 
XI.

CHAPTER IV 

FOOD PREPARATION, THE PRINCIPLES AND 

TECHNIQUE 

The principles of cooking. — In science the word " prin- 
ciple *' ordinarily means a formulation of some general or 
constant mode of behavior — a generalization based on many- 
observations of fact. In cookery the word is used in the 
same sense ; for example, one may say that an important 
principle to bear in mind when cooking with any fat is that 
the fats may be melted without decomposition, but when too 
strongly heated they begin to decompose with the production 
of acrid and irritating products. Sometimes, however, we 
speak of " principles of cookery " in a broader and some- 
what less exact sense to indicate the general purposes of 
cooking operations, as when we say that the most important 
principle of vegetable cookery is to soften the fiber without 
destroying the flavor or dissolving away the ash constituents 
of the vegetable. 

That is, the change either chemical or physical that takes 
place in a certain foodstuff by the application of heat or 
cold or by the use of a fermentation process may be referred 
to as the underlying, working principle. We shall study in 
detail these changes as we experiment with and prepare each 
food material, but a general statement of the effect of heat 
on various foodstuffs will be helpful here. 

Protein, — There are several forms of protein, with dif- 
ferences that we can understand only after a thorough study 
of chemistry. The most important proteins in meat, fish, 

54 



FOOD PREPARATION 55 

eggS; milk, old beans and peas coagulate, or become slightly 
harder or firmer at a temperature below the boiling point of 
water. We shall perform an experiment to show this while 
studying the egg. There is no marked chemical change; 
that is, the protein is not changed to another substance. 

Fats. — Solid fats are liquefied by heat, and freed from the 
tissue that contains them In animal fats like suet. 

When a fat begins to smoke with heat, a chemical chajige is 
taking place. If intense heat is continued, all the hydrogen 
and oxygen are driven off and pure carbon remains. When 
the fat is " brown," giving the flavor we like, a part of the 
oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off. The " boiling " 
of fat in a kettle is ordinarily due to the boiling of the water 
contained in the fat. 

Starch. — Starch occurs in the form of granules. See 
Fig. 39. In boiling water, the granule expands and finally 
bursts, and frees the content, the pure starch, and the whole 
mass thickens. 

Boiled with an acid the starch is changed to dextrin, a sub- 
stance resembling a gum, and the mixture becomes thin; 
and this process continued changes the dextrin to dextrose. 

With intense " dry " heat, as in toasting, the granule 
expands and opens, and the contents change to' dextrin. 
Continued heat reduces the starch to pure carbon. The 
brown color and pleasant flavor in toast are a stage on the 
road to carbon. 

Sitgar. — Sugar first melts with heat, then begins to de- 
compose, giving off water. This is also a stage on the road 
to pure carbon. Caramel, a familiar flavor, is sugar in the 
brown stage, with the water partly driven off. 

The art in appljdng intense heat to fat, starch, and sugar 
is to know the stopping point, — to reach the " brown taste " 
and stop short of the '' burnt taste.'' 



66 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Mineral maMer. — The " ash " remains for the most part 
unchanged by heat, but may be lost in the water in which 
vegetables and meat are cooked if the water is thrown 
away. 

Vegetable fiber is softened by heat and moisture, and the 
protein, starch, fat, and sugar are freed, making them avail- 
able for our digestion and nutrition. 

Meat fiber softens at a low temperature, that is, below the 
boiling point of water, with moisture; continued intense 
heat shrinks and hardens it. A tender steak fried with fat 
in a hot pan will soon resemble sole leather. 

The technique of food preparation. — From the moment 
the food materials enter the kitchen until the unusable 
portions are destroyed or carried away, there is a best way 
of working with them at each step, and the sum of these may 
be said to make a good technique. This technique will 
include cleanliness first and foremost, then skill in the use of 
tools, judgment in managing cooking apparatus and in ap- 
plying heat in cooking processes, and accuracy and rapidity 
of execution. It will also include or add to itself the aesthetic 
element, the fine art of flavoring, the dainty garnishing of a 
dish. Moreover, this technique is the method of putting 
into practice some basic, scientific principle. To illustrate : 

The principle that underlies toast-making is threefold, — 

Heat evaporates moisture throughout the slice of hread. 

Intense heat changes the content of the starch granules on the 
surface of the slice of bread to dextrin. 

Intense heat, long continued, will change first the surface starch, 
and then all, to carbon (charcoal). 

A good technique will secure the first two, and avoid the third and 
includes, — 

The selection of bread already partially dry. 

The cutting of bread into slices of uniform thickness. 

Regulating the source of heat. 



FOOD PREPARATION 67 

Placing the slioes fimdy in a toaster, or on a fork, or evenly on a 
rack when toasting by gas. 

Keeping the toast at a distance from the source of heat that in- 
sures a steady but not too rapid change. 

Turning the toaster or the slices to cook each surface in turn 
and thus to make the process slower. 

Stopping the process before carbon is formed and the toast 
'* burned." (A good technique does not include scraping the toast!) 

The (Bathetic element in toast-making might be a pretty shape 
of the slices, say triangular pieces, and a dainty arrangement. In 
this case and in others it is true that the result of a good technique 
is Aesthetic, in that correct manipulation while securing the desired 
chemical change also develops the pleasing golden brown that 
makes the toast so attractive. 

The care of food materials. — When food materials are 
delivered, have receptacles ready for each kind of food. (See 
kitchen furnishing.) Attend first to perishable foods. 
Wash and dry milk and cream bottles before putting them in 
the refrigerator. Treat eggs in the same way. This is also 
a good plan with lemons and other skin fruit, imless the 
quantity is too large, in which case they should not be put 
into the refrigerator. Remove wrappings from meat, 
poultry, and fish; wipe them with a soft cloth, dipped in 
salt and water, dry them, and place them in the ice box. 
Wash the cloth thoroughly and dry it. Fish should be 
covered that its odor may not affect other food. Vegetables 
like lettuce, celery, and spinach should be washed and 
picked over immediately, and the poor portions thrown away. 
All semi-perishable foods should be put in a cool, dry place, 
and the non-perishables in their separate receptacles. (See 
page 20.) Do not keep anything in brown paper bags, but 
save these bags for other uses. 

Have a regular time for inspecting and for cleaning all the 
places and receptacles where food is kept. Do not allow any 
spilled food material to remain anywhere, and do not tolerate 



58 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the presence of any material, cooked or uncooked, that shows 
the least taint. A keen sense of smell is a good servant here. 

The processes of food preparation. — ' With kitchen in 
order, tools ready, and food materials at hand, we are ready 
for the actual food preparation. A distinction is to be 
made between cookery and cooking. Cookery includes 
all the steps necessary to produce the finished product, 
while cooking is the actual application of heat, only one 
step of the whole process, though, indeed, one of the most 
important and difficult. The order of procedure in food 
preparation is as •follows : 

See first that the stove is ready (Chapter IV). Then 
comes the choice and study of the recipe or the method of 
cooking. The word " recipe '' is from a Latin word meaning 
" take." Follow this advice and " take '' or bring together 
on the work table whatever materials are needed. Decide 
upon the necessary utensils, and place them conveniently 
near. As you gather the materials together you will measure 
and weigh the exact amounts. Do this before you begin 
the putting together or mixing. Sometimes instead of mixing, 
the necessary process is paring, or scraping, or cutting, each 
with its own best way. Then follows the application of 
heat. Some foods are then served at once, others must be 
carefully put away after cooling. Or again, there is no ap- 
plication of heat, for instance, when the freezing temperature 
is used in ice cream ; or in a salad, or fruit preparation where 
cooling in the refrigerator is the next step. The technique 
of preparing a meal and serving will be found in Chapter XVI. 

How to study a recipe. — Remember that a recipe is a 
bit of experience handed down for us to make useful. Some 
one experimented at some time long ago, perhaps failed at 
first, tried again, finally succeeded, and passed on the result 
by word of mouth to others. There were doubtless good 



FOOD PREPARATION 69 

cooks long before there were printed or written recipes. Some 
recipes, however, have been handed down from Roman times, 
and recipes were printed as early as the sixteenth century. 
Modem recipes are much more accurate than the old, as 
you may see if you have opportunity to read some old cook 
book. 

At first in using a recipe follow its directions exactly. 
Notice the proportions, and read carefully the directions for 
combmmg the ingredients, noting those points that are 
most important. Have the whole process well in mind before 
you begin work. Do not let it be necessary to refer to the 
printed page at every move you make. This is poor 
technique. 

When the use of a recipe is preceded by some simple ex- 
periment that makes the basic principle clear, it is much 
easier to use the recipe with intelligence. 

When you are no longer a novice you may take liberties 
with a recipe, even a new one, scanning it with a critical eye, 
and perhaps giving it a cool welcome. It may not be new 
at all ! For this is the secret of recipes, — there are really 
only a few, and the key to their use is the recognition of the 
old in the new garb, and the having of a few type recipes 
clearly in mind. Each kind of prepared dish has one, or 
two, or three basic forms or mixtures. Learn these, and then 
with experience you will become inventive, and make your 
own variations. For example, there are but two kinds of 
cake, — those made with butter (or other fat) and those 
without butter (the sponge cake). You will not attempt to 
memorize many recipes, but you will find that in studying 
these type recipes you have learned a few proportions so well 
that you cannot forget them. When you have reached this 
stage of freedom you will still do exact work, but your in- 
genuity and taste wiJ^ have free play and you will not be 



60 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tied to other people's recipes. But you cannot well begin 
at this end. 

Make some plan for recording new recipes that you test 
and find good. It may be a printed recipe, or one that a 
friend gives you. The most convenient plan is a recipe box 
or card file. The guide cards are arranged alphabetically, 
and each recipe is either pasted upon a card or written 
upon it. This plan makes it easy to discard an old recipe, 
or one that has proved unsatisfactory, and to keep new 
recipes in alphabetical order, which cannot be done in a book. 
A loose leaf book is made for recipes, alphabetized at the side, 
with envelopes for holding cuttings that may be fastened in 
between the pages. This is a little less easy to use than 
the card file. 

Weighing and measuring. — The system is "Avoir- 
dupois," sixteen ounces to the pound. Learn to read the 
scales exactly, and when weighing, always allow for the 
weight of the utensil or paper holding the food. Weighing 
is more accurate than measuring, but it is slower, and the 
measuring can be made sufficiently accurate for most daily 
work. Weighing is necessary in the cookery of large pieces 
of meat and with poultry in order to estimate correctly the 
time for cooking; and it is more convenient to weigh than 
measure when preserving fruit if the quantities are large. 
Also in studying food values it is usually necessary to weigh 
the articles of food. 

The measures in common use are the saltspoon, teaspoon, and 
tablespoon, the half-pint measuring cup, the pint, quart, and 
gallon of liquid measure. The saltspoon is not accurate, and 
it is better to use some fraction of a teaspoonful. Teaspoons 
and tablespoons of a standard volume may be found at some fur- 
nishing shops. The spoons in common use vary in size, and the 
only way to approximate accuracy is to use the level spoonful. ^ 



FOOD PREPARATION 61 

This is now the common practice. Tin and glass half-pint 
cups are made gauged in quarters and thirds. Those 
commonly on sale sometimes measure more than one fourth 
of the standard quart. Inquire when you buy if the cup 
measure is standard, — that is, exactly one half standard 
pint. A quart measure, with four divisions, is necessary 
for careful work. A pint measure is convenient, but not 
necessary if you have the quart and half-pint measuring cup. 

It is necessary to know the relation of these different 
weights and measures to each other. While you may find 
tables of relative weight and measures in many cookbooks, 
it is much better for you to work out a few of the most useful 
for yourself, making careful record in your notebooks. 

The following abbreviations are short cuts in reading and 
writmg. 



oz. = ounce 
lb. = pound 
ssp. = saltspoonful 
tsp. = teaspoonful 
tb«p. = tablespoonful 



cp. = cup 

pt. = pint 

qt. = quart 

gall. = gallon 



If you wish something quicker even than this for note- 
book work, you can use. 



t = teaspoonful 
T = tablespoonful 
C = cup 



P =pint 
Q = quart 
G = gallon 



Experiments in weighing and measuring.^ 

Answer these questions by performing the experiments. Record 
in notebook in orderly form. 

* Tbacheb's Note. — These experiments may be performed as each food 
material is used. In this case a page should be kept in the notebook for 
the table of weights and measures, and each observation recorded as it is 
made. It may be that the perishable articles will not be on hand, except 
as they are used in order. The weighing and measuring should be dwelt 
on all through the course. 



62 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Apparatus, Standard scales, a quart measure, and for each pu- 
pil a measuring cup, table knife, teaspoon, and tablespoon. 
Materials, Those mentioned below. 

1. How many eggs (medium size) to 1 lb.? 

2. What is the weight of one egg ? 

3. Of one pint of flour? 

4. Of one cup of flour? 

5. Of one cup of granulated sugar? 

6. Of one cup of powdered sugar ? 

7. Of one pint of milk? 

8. Average the weight of six potatoes. 

9. How many level teaspoonfuls of flour to a level tablespoonful ? 

10. How many teaspoonfuls of water to a tablespoonful ? 

11. How many tablespoonfuls of flour to a cup? 

12. How many tablespoonfuls of water to a cup ? 

(These relative measures are convenient for dividing recipes.) 

13. Measure a level tablespoonful of flour, by filling the spoon, 
holding it level, and leveling the flour by running the back of the 
knife quickly from the base of the bowl of the spoon to the tip. 

How can you most accurately divide this in halves ? In quar- 
ters? 

14. How much does a cup of flaked cereal weigh ? 

15. How much does a cup of granular cereal weigh? 

16. Butter is hard to measure in a cup. If a recipe calls for i 
cup butter, it is easier to measure it by tablespoonfuls. Find out 
how many make i cup. 

17. How much does a cup of butter weigh? If you know this, 
you can weigh it, instead of measuring, or if your butter is in pound 
" pats,** you will be able to cut off a cupful, instead of weighing it. 

18. An old-fashioned recipe for sponge cake reads thus : Take 
the weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour. Trans- 
late this into measures. 

Preparing and mixing. — Food materials that are not to 
be mixed with others still need special preparation before 
heat is applied. 

For fruits and vegetables, washing is the first stage, followed by 
scraping, paring, peeling, cutting, or slicing. Meats, poultry, and 



FOOD PREPARATION 63 

fish must be cleaned by wiping, and cut and trimmed with a sharp 
knife. 

Cooked meats and fish and vegetables may be chopped or sliced. 

Cooked vegetables are also masked and beaten. 

Cream is whipped or beden, and eggs served raw likewise. 

These seem simple processes, but each one needs a good tool and 
a knack in the muscles. Each method will be taken up in detail, 
with each food material. 

Methods of mixing are important, where several ingredients 
are combined. We seek for a way that will give the most 
complete mingling of all the substances with smoothness 
and lightness, at the same time saving time and strength. 
We must look always for the " short cut." It is necessary 
to have the texture of the food such that it can be well 
masticated and mixed with the digestive fluids, but time is 
too precious to spend hours on a dessert, or in beating 
biscuits. 

Sifting, or putting materials through a fine mesh, is used to lighten 
flour that has been packed down, to remove coarse portions, or to 
mix thoroughly several dry inljedients. j 

Stirring is done with a spoon, and is a round and round motion, 
used for mixing a liquid and a dry ingredient. 

Rubbing is used for combining a dry ingredient with a semi-solid 
substance like butter. Creaming is a term used for the rubbing of 
butter until it becomes soft and creamy. A spoon should be used, 
not the hand. 

" Cutting in *' with a knife is used for combining butter with 
flour in biscuit and pastry wher^ the butter should not be softened. 

Beating with a spoon, or beater of the spoon type, is a free over 
and over motion, the spoon being lifted from the mixture for the 
backward stroke. This is used for increasing the smoothness of 
the mixture after the first stirring, and for beating in air. It needs 
a strong free motion of the forearm. Beating is also accomplished 
by the rotary motion of a mechanical beater like the Dover. 

Cutting and folding is the delicate process of mixing lightly beaten 
egg with a liquid or semi-liquid without losing out the air. The 



64 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

spoon is cut in, sidewise, a rotary motion carries it down and up 
again, and it folds in the beaten egg as it goes. 

Kneading is a motion used with dough, and is a combination of 
a rocking and pressing motion, .accomplished by the hands. A 
good result can be obtained by some bread machines, and this is the 
cleaner method. 

Rolling out is just what the term denotes, a rolling of a thick piece 
of dough by means of a cylindrical wooden " pin " to the thickness 
proper for cookies and crusts. Dry bread is also rolled to break 
it into fine crumbs. 

Pounding and grinding are usually accomplished for us now in 
factories in breaking of spices and coffee. It is better to have a 
coffee mill at home. 

The order of mixing is important in its effect in batters and doughs 
and is discussed in that chapter. 

Cooking processes. — For the beginnings of cooking we 
should need to go back to the days when game was roasted 
by the open fire, built for warmth, or corn parched on hot 
stones. Perhaps some root was cooked in the hot ashes. 
This primitive method of roasting we still use in camp fires, 
and in modified form wherever food is directly exposed to 
the heat of coal or gas. Water could not be a cooking 
medium until man advanced at least to the first stage of 
pottery making, when some rude basket daubed with clay 
was water-tight and sufficiently heat proof. 

Application of heat is the most difficult stage of the whole 
process of cookery. It is so easy to have the heat too intense, 
or too low, to expose the food for too long or too short a time 
to its action. Most of our apparatus fails to give us a uni- 
form heat, the tendency being to an increase or decrease 
of temperature. Since the boiling temperature of water re- 
"mains at 212® F., boiling is an easy process to manage, pro- 
vided the water does not boil out. The presence of water 
insures a low or moderate temperature always. 

It requires patience and time to learn how to bring this 



FOOD PREPARATION 65 

natural force of heat under control. One novice who had 
allowed a flour paste to boil over and bum while she was 
looking out of the window remarked : " We may forget, 
but they never do ! " — a pretty way of stating the steady 
working of nature's forces which we can harness for our use 
only by the exercise of reason and will and constant watch- 
fulness. The unintelligent cook is impatient of slow pro- 
cesses, and cannot believe that food will finally be " done " 
unless the water is at a " galloping " boil, and a red-hot fire 
is keeping the oven at burning temperature. 

Look upon the application of heat as a continuation of 
nature's slow ripening process, a softening of tough fibers 
and a development of pleasing flavors. For why do we cook 
at all except for these reasons? Primitive man thought only 
that the food had a better taste. He may have decided, too, 
that it was easier to masticate; but we have learned that 
in some cases we may, with right methods of cooking, make it 
easier to digest farther on in the alimentary canal. Modern 
science carries us a step farther and teaches us that cooking 
destroys lower organisms, such as harmful bacteria that may 
be present, and even animal parasites in meats. 

We cook, therefore, to improve the appearance of Jood, to 
develop flavors, to render some foodstuffs more digestible and to 
destroy microorganisms. 

We have at our command the following processes : 

Heat direct from coal, charcoal, wood, or gas. 

Toasting. — Surfaces of food exposed and turned for browning. 

Broiling. — Thin portions of meat or fish exposed and turned for 
searing, browning, and short cooking of the interior. 

Roasting. — Thicker cuts of meat exposed and turned frequently 
for searing, browning, and gradual cooking of the interior. This 
is an ancient method. It survives in the French " Rdtisserie " ; 
and we use it in the modem gas stove when we cook directly under 
the gas. 

p 



66 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Heat through an interrening medium. 

Waier, the medium. 

Boiling. — Cooking in boiling water, temperature, 212" F., or 
IW C. 

Simmering t stewing, or " coddling J" — Cooking in water below 
the boiling temperature. ISO** F. up to 210** F. < 

Steaming, — Cooking in a receptacle into which steam pene- 
trates, 212** F. — ^ or in a closed receptacle surrounded by steam or 
boiling water as in a double boiler, o^ a " stealner,*' temperature 
from 200** F. to 210'' F. 

Fat, the medium. 

Deep fat frying, temperature 350**-400'' F. 
Heated surfaces, the medium. 

Pan broiling — Cooking of chops or steaks in a heated pan, with- 
out additional fat. 

Saut4. — To cook in a heated pan with a small amount of fat, 
enough merely to prevent the food from sticking to the pan and to 
hasten the browning process. ." Baking *' cakes on a griddle is a 
modification of this method. 

Baking. — Cooking in a heated oven, temperature from 300** F. to 
450® F., or higher for rapid browning. Meat and poultry cooked 
in an oven are baked and not roasted, although we use the word 
" roast " for this method. 

Braising, — Cooking meat in a heated oven in a closed vessel, 
with a supply of water to keep down the temperature. This might 
be called an " oven stew." 

These methods are sometimes combined in one process. In 
a brown stew, the meat is first cooked in a pan with a little fat to 
brown it, and to sear the outside for retaining the juices, before the 
actual stewing begins. A *' pot-roast,'' is an old-fashioned method 
of cooking a solid piece of meat with a little water in a pot on top 
of the stove. The water simmers out, and the meat is browned. 
What methods does this process unite ? 

The American Indians in their Squantum, or Clam Bake, heated 
a layer of stones by means of a fire on top, removing the ashes 
when the fire died down. A layer of wet seaweed was placed on the 
stones, and upon this clams, fish, and com were laid, and covered 
with another layer of seaweed. We have inherited this method from 
the Indians, and use it at the shore. What is the cooking process ? 



FOOD PREPARATION 67 

Care of food after cooking. — Bread, cake, cookies, and 
pastry should be cooled on a rack, or spread out \n such a 
way that they do not steam. They should then be placed 
in a tin box or stone jar, which has been cleaned by washing 
and scalding with boiling water, and thoroughly dried. 
This process destroys any mold that might be lurking about. 
Keep paraffin paper on haiid to cover this class of food in 
its box or jar. This will prevent too rapid drying out. Do 
not use cloth. It flavors the bread or cake, no matter how 
clean it may be. 

All food that is to be served cold or reheated should be 
cooled before placing in the ice box. For what reason? 
Cool by placing in a draught, or set the vessel containing 
the food in running cold water from the faucet. It is par- 
ticularly important to cool soups and broths rapidly. Which 
of these methods will you use, as being the more rapid? 

All meat that is to be served cold should be cooled, es- 
pecially if it is rare, or underdone. How will you accomplish 
this? 

Care of left overs. — This is one of the tests of food manage- 
ment. It is so easy at the end of a meal either to throw^ 
food away, or set it into the refrigerator on the dish in which 
it has been served. Have a good supply of cheap bowls, 
plates, and saucers to hold left overs in the refrigerator, thus 
avoiding one possibility for breakage of the table china. 

Keep slices of bread for toasting, pieces of bread, to dry for crumbs, 
with special receptacles for each. Return pieces of cake to the cake 
box. Muffins may be reheated. Toast may be kept to serve under 
eggs or meat. 

All butter should be saved. Pieces left on butter plates if clean 
should be scraped into a wide-mouthed jar and kept for cooking. 

Pieces of meat should be kept for reheating or *■ made " dishes, 
stews or soups or for salads. In hot weather, let your first order 
of meat be small, and dispose of left overs as rapidly as possible. 



68 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Vegetables may be reheated, or used for flavoring soups and stews, 
or used cold in salads. 

Desserts and fruits may be used for a '* pick up " luncheon. 

Salads do not keep their freshness and flavor well, and should 
be used very soon. 

Milk and cream should be returned to proper receptacles in the 
refrigerator as soon as possible. 

Disposal of waste food. — This is the final test of good 
housekeeping, and many otherwise good housekeepers fail 
just here. Even at its best the garbage pail is not altogether 
a pleasing object, and at its worst it is unspeakable. It 
must not be ignored. 

Have a system adapted to your own kitchen, and the 
municipal method of disposal, if there is such. 

Use a covered pail of enamel ware, rather than one of galvanized 
iron. The surface of the enamel is smooth, and therefore easier 
to wash, and there is no excuse for putting off the cleansing of the 
pail. Wash, rinse, and dry the pail and the cover immediately after it 
is emptied. Do not put a piece of paper in the bottom of the pail. 
This request is made by the department in New York City, and it is 
always better not to mix food waste and paper waste. If you hve in 
an apartment house, your name should be painted on the pail. 

Never put liquid into the garbage pail with solid refuse. Strain 
out whatever liquid may be left in coffee or tea, and pour it into the 
sink drain. ■ If there is a greasy hquid to throw away, add to it a 
teaspoonful or more of washing powder, and let it stand a time. If 
you have used enough of the powder, you will find that you have a 
soapy liquid to pour down the sink. 

Coffee, tea, cocoa, or lemonade left in cups should be diluted 
and poured down the sink and never into the garbage pail. 

Empty garbage at evening when possible, to prevent the long 
standing through the night. Keep the pail closely covered both 
day. and night, to keep out flies, and water bugs, if they are about. 
AUow the pail to stand outside the kitchen unless the fire escape is 
the only accessible out-of-doors. Remember that the fire escape 
is not a back porch, and that you would be fined for using it as such 
if the inspectors were efficient. 



FOOD PREPARATION 69 

There are two classes of waste: uncooked refuse, like 
potato skins, egg shells, pea pods, meat trimmings and 
bones ; and table scraps from plates. 

Pieces of fat may be " tried out," but do not accumulate more 
than you use. A few egg shells may be kept for settling coffee, 
but again do not keep too many. 

The country dweller has a simple problem. What the farm ani- 
mals do not eat will serve as fertilizer for plant life. After the bones 
have been picked, keep them together, in some receptacle, and 
finally bury or bum them. Have a compost heap properly covered 
where the uneaten fragments will decompose and make fertilizer, 
or bury them at once if preferred. 

The city dweller who uses a coal stove is able to bum some refuse. 
Strain out whatever liquid is present, dry the refuse under the 
grate, and put it into a hot fire. Do not crowd damp refuse into 
the fire box when the fire is low, for it will smoulder, and this heavy 
smoke will eventually clog the fines. The odor of this smoke, too, 
is disagreeable in the neighborhood. A garbage drier, set into the 
stove pipe, has been devised, but the simpler plan of drjdng the refuse 
under the grate is quite as satisfactory. 

Where gas or kerosene is the fuel, or where electricity is used, the 
garbage pail is the only resort, unless onelives in a building equipped 
with a special stove or " garbage burner " for the disposal of waste.

CHAPTER V 
WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 

Although water does not supply energy to the body, it 
plays an important part in nutrition. As building material, 
it constitutes about two thirds of the body weight, and as a 
regulator of body processes it serves as a solvent and carrier 
of nutritive material and waste, keeps the blood and digestive 
fluids of proper concentration, and helps to regulate the 
temperature of the body. It is contained in nearly all food 
materials and is the basis of all beverages. 

Water as a beverage. — Water is being given off all the 
time from the body through the lungs, skin, and kidneys. 
The exact amount depends partly upon atmospheric con- 
ditions and the amount of exercise, which affect the loss 
through the lungs and skin, and partly on the amount taken 
in, for water passes through the body rather quickly. We 
can endure lack of food for weeks, but can exist only a few 
days without water. 

A drink of water taken the first thing in the morning tends 
to clean out the digestive tract and put one in good condition 
for breakfast. Water with meals aids digestion, provided 
it is not used to wash down food but is taken when the 
mouth is empty. It should not be extremely cold nor hot. 
Two glasses at a single meal are usually all that are desirable. 
When there is much water in the food, as in soups, milk, 
fruits, and some vegetables, or when other beverages are 
taken, less will be taken as plain water. When one feels 

70 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 71 

hungry and uncomfortable between meals a drink of water 
will often relieve the sensation. 

Water is either soft or hard. Rain water is perfectly soft, 
but as it passes through the earth after falling, it sometimes 
becomes laden with mineral substances, that affect its cleans- 
ing properties, and that may affect its physiological action. 
Such water is called hard. 

Temporary hardness is caused by a soluble lime compound 
which is precipitated by boiling. If the teakettle is in- 
crusted inside by a layer of lime, the hardness is of this 
character. Such water should be boiled and cooled for 
drinking. Permanent hardness is due to other compounds of 
lime and magnesia which are not precipitated by boiling, 
but which can be counteracted for cleansing purposes by the 
addition of some substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. 
If the excess of salts has some undesirable physiological 
effect, this water should be distilled, or bottled water for 
drinking brought from ^sewhere. 

Of much greater importance is the question of the freedom 
of the water supply from harmful bacteria and organic matter. 
Never use a well without having the water tested by an 
expert. This will sometimes be done by the local or state 
Board of Health or Experiment Station. All water sources 
should be guarded from contamination. (See " Shelter and 
Clothing,'' Chapter V.) Filters may be used, and are effective 
in straining out sediment, but the home filter is seldom to be 
relied upon to remove actual bacterial contamination. If used 
at all, the filter should be frequently cleaned and sterilized in 
boiling water. In case the supply is suspected, the water for 
drinking should be boiled for at least ten minutes, allowed to 
settle, if necessary, and poured off into bottles for cooling. This 
is a practice to be commended after a heavy rainfall, and espe- 
cially in the autumn. These bottles may be placed on the ice. 



72 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Ice must be used with caution always in drinking water, 
and it is the safer way to cool the water beside the ice. The 
freezing of water in pond and river does not purify or sterilize 
it. Natural ice is usiially questionable. Artificial ice, if 
properly manufactured, is much safer. 

Always have a supply of water in covered pitcher or water 
bottle, with clean glasses at hand, where it may be taken 
freely when wanted. Remember that the individual cup or 
glass is an absolute necessity. The dipper or glass in common 
must not be countenanced. In a large family of many chil- 
dren it would save labor to use paper cups between meals. 

Water should be swallowed slowly, and ice-cold water 
should not be taken when one is overheated. When one is 
overthirsty, control must be exercised in regard to quantity 
and rapidity of drinking. 

Water in cooking. — Water is necessary to the softening 
of fiber, and the cooking of starch. It acts as a solvent for 
sugar and salt and for gelatin, ai^ is the basis of meat soups, 
certain substances in the meat dissolving in the water. The 
flavors of tea and coffee are extracted by water. 

As a medium in cooking it supplies heat in the steaming, 
boiling, and stewing processes, and in the form of melting ice 
with salt it acts as a freezing medium. 

It is not necessary to lift the cover of a kettle to see if the 
water boils, if one is familiar with the action of water nearing 
and at the boiling point. A simple experiment with the 
boiling of water in a Florence flask is always interesting, and 
from it one gains practical knowledge. 

Experiments with the boiling temperature of water. 

A, Apparatus: A ring stand, a Florence flask, a square of wire 

net, a chemical thermometer, a Bunsen burner. 
Method: Place the Florence flask, half full of water, on the 

square of wire net upon the large ring of the ring stand 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 73 

over the Bunsen burner. Put the ohemioal thermometer 
ill the Florence flask, clamping it in such a way that the 
bulb is covered by the water and yet does not touch the 
bottom of the flask. 
Make record in the notebook as follows : 

(1) The temperature when the first small bubbles appear on 

the side of the flask. 

(2) Temperature when the first large bubbles appear on the 

bottom. 

(3) Temperatm-e when many bubbles rise rapidly to the top. 

(4) Point at which temperature ceases to rise. 

(5) Temperature when vapor first appears at the mouth of the 

flask. 

(6) What differences are apparent in the amount and motion 

of the vapor before and after boiling ? 

(7) Lift the thermometer above the water and note the tem- 

perature just above the surface, when the water is 
rapidly boiling. 
The small bubbles are bubbles of air. The large are bubbles of 
steam. A complete study of the boiling process should be made in 
the Physics class. The boiling point is the point at which water 
becomes steam, and also the point at which steam condenses again 
to water. The temperature of boiling water and steam are the 
same. Under pressure steam may be heated to a higher tempera- 
ture. 
B. Boil water in a small saucepan closely covered. 

(1) Note the sounds of the water just before boiling, and the 

change in sound as the boiling begins. 

(2) Note the difference between the vapor escaping, before 

boiling, and after. This experiment is best performed 
in a teakettle. 

C Test the temperature of the inner part of the double boiler, 
when the water boils rapidly below. To be exact, a 
hole should be bored in the cover of the boiler, a cork with 
a hole inserted, the thermometer run through the cork. 
An approximate result is obtained by putting in the 
thermometer, setting on the cover tilted, and covering 
the opening with a cloth. 

D, Stir salt into rapidly boiling water in the lower part of the 



74 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

double boiler until no more salt will dissolve (a saturated 
solution). Test the temperature. 
E. Put the inner part of the double boiler containing water into 
this boiling solution of saturated salt, being sure that 
the inner part is sufficiently deep in the salt solution. 
Note the temperature of the water in the inner boiler 
when it becomes heated. 

Boiling at high altitudes. — When the air pressure upon 
the surface of the water is lessened, the water boils at a lower 
temperature. As the altitude increases, the air pressure 
decreases, as many a mountain traveler knows to his cost. 
The boiling temperature of water is so much lowered that 
tlie dwellers in high regiohs of several thousand feet find 
it difficult to cook starchy vegetables well. A heavy iron 
pot is made with clamps for fastening down a tight cover, 
which increases the temperature somewhat. Experiments D 
and E indicate a method that can be used to a small extent. 
The baking process should be largely used, and boiling 
avoided. For meat, eggs, and fish the lower temperature is 
not undesirable. (See the chapters relating to these foods.) 

The uses of ice. — Water freezes and ice melts at the 
same point, 32° F., or 0° C. If ice is mixed with salt, the 
temperature is reduced far below the freezing point, nearly 
to 0° F. This process reduces any watery substance which it 
surrounds to its freezing point, the heat being used in the 
melting of the ice. This is an interesting topic to discuss 
in the Physics class. 

Ice at its ordinary temperature of 32° F. is used for cooling 
food agreeably. Its most important function in the refrigera- 
tor is as preserver of food for a short time at least. For 
this it is invaluable, and cheap ice is really necessary in 
sunmier to the health of a great city. 

Ice substitutes. — Where the supply fails or the price is 
exorbitant, one property of water makes it a partial aid. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 75 

The rapid evaporation of water will absorb heat so rapidly 
as to reduce the temperature of adjacent bodies. In the 
tropics when ice is lacking, water is hung in porous jars in the 
breeze, and the temperature of the water in the Jar is reduced. 

To keep milk and butter cool wrap a wet cloth about the 
containing jar, and set the jar upon the window sill, keeping 
one end of the towel in a vessel of water ; or the cloth may 
be wrapped directly around the butter. This method is 
surprisingly effective. 

Fruit beverages. — Fruit juices with water and sugar 
make refreshing beverages and have nutritive value as well. 
(See the next chapter.) ^ 

Cocoa and chocolate, coffee, and tea. — These are the 
three most important non-alcoholic beverages used by man. 
They are used because of the agreeable flavor given them by 
volatile oils, and also because they have a stimulating effect. 
The stimulating property is due to an alkaloid, a crystalliz- 
able substance known in cocoa as theobromine, in coffee as 
caffeine, and in tea as theine. Chemical investigation in- 
dicates that caffeine and theine are the same and theobromine 
is a closely related substance. These substances have a recog- 
nized stimulating effect upon the nervous system, and the 
beverages containing them should therefore be used with 
caution by all. In the opinion of the writers, tea and coffee 
should not be taken by young people under twenty-five years 
of age. Tea and coffee also contain tannin, an astringent 
substance giving a disagreeable flavor to coffee and tea when 
these are improperly made, and having an undesirable effect 
upon digestion. Chocolate contains a non-volatile fat (cocoa 
butter) in large amount, and should be classed as a food as 
well as a beverage. 

The plants from which cocoa, coffee, and tea are derived 
are natives of semi-tropical or tropical Africa, Asia, and 



76 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

America, having been introduced to Europe by early travel- 
ers in these lands. 

The introduction of these beverages is an interesting bit of his- 
tory. The Spaniards found cocoa in tropical America, and carried 
it back to Spain, and it was not used in England until 1657. It 
was sold in Danvers, Massachusetts, in 1771, the raw material 
having been brought by Gloucester fishermen from the West Indies. 
Coffee is said to have originated in Abyssinia, reaching Europe by 
way of Arabia, and being sold in England in 1650. Coffee-houses 
were licensed in America in 1715. A Chinese tradition places the 
discovery of the use of tea at 2700 b.c. It was first used in England 
in 1657, and was imported into America in 1711. An amusing 
story is told of the first tea party in a town of western Connecticut, 
where the tea was boiled violently in a large iron kettle and served 
on a platter with the leaves, as a form of soup, the leaves themselves 
being eaten. 

Cocoa and chocolate. — Cocoa and chocolate are manu- 
factured from the seed of a tree, Theobroma cacao, grown in 
tropical America. The seeds, when removed from the con- 
taining pod, are fermented to improve the flavor, dried, 
cleaned, roasted, and finally ground. The outer husk is 
loosened in the roasting, and is then removed, and sold 
as " cocoa shells." It is the basis of a cheap beverage 
with an agreeable flavor. The first crushing of the seeds 
gives cocoa " nibs," and these are further ground in a mill, 
and finally molded into the cake of plain chocolate. The 
addition of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and sometimes other 
spices gives a variety of sweet chocolates. Powdered cocoa 
is prepared by the removal of the fat, which is a valuable 
product in itself, sugar and flavorings are added and some- 
times a starch. The Dutch manufacturers use alkalies 
for removing the crude fiber and improving the color, and 
the consequent loss of flavor is balanced by the use of other 
flavoring matter. The adulterations of cocoa are largely 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 77 

starch in excess. The French and American cocoas are 
flavored with vanilla, the Dutch manufacturers using cinna- 
mon as well. 

The so-called soluble cocoas are very finely ground, and 
therefore mix readily with water, remaining in suspension 
for some time, but the cocoa itself is not dissolved. Powdered 
cocoa is bought in tin cans, is cheap, and is even more eco- 
nomical if bought in large cans than in small. Chocolate is 
more expensive always than the cocoa, and may be bought 
in cakes in poimd packages, or in powdered form for im- 
mediate use. 

Coffee is the inner seed of a berry from a tree, Coffea arabka, 
the process of manufacture consisting of the removal of the 
outer pulp, fermentation, washing, drying, and rqastmg. 
The first stages of the process are carried on at the coffee 
plantation, the raw berries being imported, and roasted 
shortly before using. The roasting in cocoa, coffee, and 
tea is necessary for desirable flavors, the heat developing 
volatile, aromatic principles, caramelizing the sugar, and 
causing other chemical changes. The differences in the flavor 
of coffees are due to the variety, the soil and climate, and 
methods of production and manufacture. No coffee grown 
in the western hemisphere has excelled, and scarcely has any 
equaled, the original Mocha and Java coffees, and these 
have long been trade names for coffee from other places, 
because of the popular liking for these brands. Brazil is 
now the great coffee producing country of the world, and from 
South and Central America and the West Indies we obtain 
coffee of excellent flavor. 

The adulterations of coffee should be noted, although 
these are of the kind that gives the buyer something cheaper 
in place of coffee, rather than a substance that is injurious. 
Groimd chicory root is sometimes mixed with coffee, but 



78 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cannot be classed strictly as an adulterant, because many 
people, notably the French, add it openly, preferring its 
flavor. Among adulterants are rye meal, bran, beans and 
peas, cocoa shells, and even sawdust. Artificial beans have 
been made of bran, molasses, and water, sometimes with the 
addition of chicory and coloring matter. If ground coffee is 
put into a glass of cold water, it floats on the top and remains 
hard, while several of the adulterants named soften and sink 
to the bottom of the glass. Highly roasted coffee, however, 
will sometimes sink. Coffee beans from which coffee ex- 
tract has been made are sometimes mixed with other coffee. 

Coffee extracts and crystallized coffee are manufactured 
to simplify the coffee-making process, but the flavor is not 
equal to that of coffee infusion made directly from the bean. 
A preparation of coffee is also offered with the caffeine re- 
moved by some chemical process, but it is expensive in this 
country. 

Buy coffee in the bean, and see that it is freshly roasted. 
Coffee, whole or ground, is sold extensively by the pound in 
tin cans, with a fancy label and name, and in this form it is 
usually expensive. Good coffee may be bought for twenty- 
five cents a pound of many reliable dealers, and may be pur- 
chased in five or ten pound packages, or bought in bulk to be 
kept in a tightly closed can. 

Tea is the dried leaf of a shrub. Camellia thea, growing in 
the comparatively high lands of Japan, China, India, and 
Ceylon. A tea plantation exists in South Carolina, U.S.A., 
and furnishes a very pleasing grade of tea, somewhat re- 
sembling Japan tea in flavor. We are familiar with the 
fact that there are many kinds and grades of tea, the tea 
shrub varying as does the coffee tree, and the methods of 
curing affecting both color and flavor. The teas from the 
countries named have characteristic flavors, and each 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 79 

country has different varieties and grades. Russian tea is 
not grown in Russia, but is Chinese tea carried across the 
continent of Asia. 

In general, tea may be classed as green or black, this 
difference in color depending upon the age of the leaf, and 
largely upon differences m the curing process. Green tea 
is made from the yoimg leaf, and after picking is dried im- 
mediately by artificial heat, being constantly stirred for about 
an hour, in which time the leaves twist and curl. For black 
tea the leaves are allowed to wilt and ferment, before they 
are rolled and heated ; and sometimes the heating is repeated. 
These details of the process vary in different localities. The 
leaves are finally sorted and graded for packing. 

Both black and green teas are made in China. " Bohea " 
is one of the famous black Chinese teas. " English Breakfast 
Tea '' is known as such only in America, and is a blend of 
black teas. Black tea is not so successfully made in Japan 
as in China. " Oolong,'' from the island of Formosa, has 
the appearance of a black tea, with the flavor of a green. 
In Japan and China old-time methods prevail, with much 
handling of the tea leaves, but in Ceylon and India modem 
machinery makes the process a much more cleanly one. 

Another classification of tea is that depending upon the 
age and size of the leaf, the young leaf making the finer grade 
tea. For example, in the black teas of India " flowery 
pekoe " is made from the youngest leaf, " orange pekoe " 
from the second, " pekoe " from the third, and " souchong " 
and " congou " come from the larger leaves. 

The adulterations of tea are usually the leaves of other 
plants, but as a matter of fact very little adulterated tea is 
imported. The first grades of teas, however, and those 
most highly prized by the Chinese and Japanese, seldom 
find their way to America. 



80 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other beverages. — Several very acceptable coffee sub- 
stitutes are on the market, made from roasted and groimd 
grain, and they give an agreeable hot drink for breakfast 
when served with cream or milk. In some cases they seem 
to have a laxative effect, which is well for some people and 
not for others. A pleasant hot drink of the same nature 
may be made from the browned crusts of bread. 

The substitutes for tea are not usually satisfactory. The 
Indians of the western coast of the United States make a tea 
from a plant which they call " Buona Yerba," but for us it 
has a strong resemblance to the medicinal herb teas formerly 
used for curative purposes, such as sage, catnip, motherwort, 
and the like. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

I. Lemonade and fruit drinks. 

Utensils, — Silver knife for paring and slicing, glass lemon 
squeezer, a grater, a strainer, and a saucepan. Avoid the 
use of tin and iron utensils. 

Materials. — Lemon or other fruits, sugar water. 

Proportions, — One half lemon to a glass, or 2 or 3 to a quart 
of water. Other fruits * * according to taste. ' ' Experiment here, 
using the juice and pulp of any fruit, combining those that 
are very acid with those that lack acidity, — lemon and rasi>- 
berry, for example. One third to J cup sugar to a quart. The 
proportion cannot be stated with exactness, for fruit varies in 
acidity, and the final result must always be tested by the taste. 

Method, 

Plain lemonade. — After deciding upon the proper amounts 
to be used, dissolve the sugar in a part of the water, brought 
to the boiling point. When cool, add the lemon juice and re- 
maining water, ice and serve. A small portion of grated rind 
may be added to the boiling water. 

Another method is to use lump sugar, rubbing the peel of the 
lemon upon each lump before dissolving. 

The general method is the same with other fruits, pulpy fruit 
and berries being mashed, the water added, and strained. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 81 

CherrieSy strawberries, and pieces of pulp are sometimes added 
before serving, when the fruit drink is ladled from a bowl as 
fruit punch. Be sure to cut the berries if they are large. A 
brightness is imparted to the fruit punch by the addition of 
carbonated water just before serving. A quart of fruit punch, 
if served in small cups, will suffice for eight i)eople. 

3. Cocoa shells. 

Principle. — To extract the flavor from the shells, by boiling 
in water. 

Utensil. — A saucepan or coffee boiler. 

Proportions. — One half cup shells to 1 quart boiling water. 
As much as 1 cup of the shells may be used. 

Method. 

Wash the shells in a strainer under the faucet. Put the 
sheUs in the pot, pour on boiling water, and simmer gently for 
J hour. Strain off, and serve with cream, or milk, or evap- 
orated milk and sugar. 

3. Cocoa. 

Principle. — To mix the particles smoothly and evenly with 
the liquid by stirring and by heating. 

Utensils. — A measuring cup, a saucepan, spoon, and beater. 
A double boiler, if milk only is used. 

Ingredients. — Powdered cocoa, sugar, water, or milk, or 
milk and water. Cocoa made with milk does not agree with 
some people, in which case it may be made with water only, 
and served with cream, milk, or evaporated milk. 

Proportions. — One teaspoonful of cocoa to J measuring cup. 
More or less as preferred. One teaspoonful of sugar, ditto. 

Method. 

Heat the liquid. Stir a portion of the liquid cold, with 
the cocoa, add this to the hot liquid, add the sugar, and beat 
vigorously for a minute before removing from the fire. 

4. Chocolate. 

Principle. — To mix the chocolate smoothly with the liquid 
that the fat may not float on the top. This is accomplished 
by having all the ingredients either hot or cold. If after the 
chocolate is dissolved in a hot liquid, cold liquid is added, the 
oil separates and floats. 



82 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Utensils. — A grater, or sharp knife, a saucepan, mixing: 
spoon, and beater. 

A French chocolate maker claims that any metal utensil 
affects the flavor of the chocolate, and always uses an earthen 
pot and wooden spoon and heater. An earthenware choco- 
late pot for this purpose is on the market. 

Ingredients, — Chocolate, sugar, milk, or milk and water. 

Proportions, — The amount of chocolate may be varied, de- 
pending upon the richness desired. Three or 4 ounce squares 
to 1 quart liquid, 4 teaspoonfuls sugar to 1 quart. The liquid 
is better half milk and half water, rather than milk only. 

Method 1,^ 

The cold method. 

Put the liquid and sugar into the saucepan. Break or cut 
the chocolate into small pieces, add to the liquid, and heat the 
liquid slowly, stirring occasionally but not constantly. When 
the liquid is hot, just before it reaches the boiling point, beat 
vigorously with a wooden spoon, or beater. The Dover 
beater is convenient. This beating makes a velvety smooth 
and a foamy mixture. 

Method 2.^ 

The hot method. 

Heat the liquid with the sugar. Grate the chocolate or shave 
it with a knife. Protect the chocolate from the warmth of 
the fingers by a piece of paper. The process is less " sticky " 
if the chocolate and grater are chilled in the refrigerator. 
Just as the liquid is reaching the boiling point, pour in the 
grated chocolate, and beat vigorously.* 

Beaten chocolate does not need any additional cream when 
served. Beaten whipped cream is attractive on the top of each 
cup. But remember that chocolate is already rich in fat, and 
that additional fat may be indigestible. Such a cup of choco- 
late taken for luncheon with a roll is sufficient for the meal, and 
is certainly too rich in fat for serving at an afternoon tea. . 

5. Coffee. 

Principle, — To extract the flavoring oils at the boiling point 
of water, and to avoid the extraction of the tannin. The 

1 Both these methods were taught by French cooks connected with well 
known chocolate firms, and both give good results. 




WATER AND OTHER BEVERAOES 83 

tannin is exto-aoted by prolonged boiling, snd when the liquid 

cofiee stands upon the grounds. 

UlensUs. — Coffee grinder, measuring cup, pot. The kind of 

pot depends upon the method used. One house furnishing 

firm displays some 

seventy different 

coffee pots, but 

they may be di- 
vided into three 

elasses, the pot for 

boiling, the drip 

coffee pot, and the ' 

percolator (see Figs. 

23 and 24). The 

coffee boiler should 

have a lip, and not 

a spout. A word 

of warning is needed in regard to the care of the pot. Coffee 

grounds should be removed From any pot immediately, and the 

pot washed at once in scalding hot soapsuds, rinsed, dried, and 
aired. Let the pot stand with 
cover off. If this is not done, a 
coat is soon formed on the inside 
of the pot, which spoils the flavor 
of the coffee. Where the pot has 
been neglected, boiling it out with 
a solution of caustic soda is some- 
times a remedy. 

IngredierUa. — Ground coffee, 
water, cold or boiling, white of 
egg or egg shell for boiled coffee. 
The coffee should be ground to 
medium fineness for boiled coffee, 

catirMsifLioiden.Fnirtaniciart. to s finer powder for the pei^ 
Fio. 24. — Acoffeeperrolatot. colated and drip coffee. 

Proportions. — One part of 

coffee to 5 or 6 of water, depending upon the strength desired. 

One egg shell, or half the white of an egg to 1 cup of ground 



84 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method 1. 

Boiling. — Measure the coffee and water. Stir the white or 
the shell of an egg with the coffee, adding a little of the water, put 
this into the pot, add the remaining water cold, stir thoroughly, 
allow the water to rise slowly to the boiling point, and to boil 
one minute, remove the pot from the fire, pour in a 
small amount of cold water, and let the coffee stand for 
five minutes or until the grounds settle. During the cooking 
close the lip with clean soft paper if it has no lid. The 
actual boiling is continued for a brief period only, and coffee 
made by this method is considered by some people to have a 
flavor lacking in drip or percolator coffee. The egg is added 
to clarify the coffee. Pour off the liquid coffee from the grounds, 
and keep hot until it is time to serve it. 

A second method differs from this in that the water is poured 
on at the boiling temperatiu-e, allowed to reach the boiling 
point in two or three minutes, and boiled for five minutes. 
The first gives uniformly better results. It is true, however, 
that different kinds of coffee need different treatment, and 
there is room here for much experimenting. 

Method 2. 

Drip coffee. — In this method the coffee is put in a recep- 
tacle above, the water passes slowly through, collecting in the 
pot below, from which it is served. Stand the lower part 
of the pot in a pan of hot water, or where it will keep hot. 
Measure the water, and bring it to the boiling point. Heat 
the ground coffee slightly, put it in the upper section of the 
pot, and pour on the water very slowly. Of course, the water 
is not actually boiling when it touches the coffee. If the liquid 
coffee is not strong enough, pour it from the lower part and 
pass it through the grounds again. This is the French method, 
and is an excellent way to prepare after-dinner coffee. 

Method 3. 

Percolator coffee. — In the percolator the water boils within 
the pot, and passes through the coffee at the boiling tem- 
perature. The exact method depends upon the pattern of 
the pot, and directions always accompany a given pot. For 
those who can use electricity, the electric percolator certainly 
gives an excellent coffee. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 85 

Coflfee is served " black," or with cream, milk, or evaporated 
milk and sugar. If milk is used for breakfast coffee, serve it hot. 

6. Tea. 

Principle, — To extract flavor by allowing the leaves to re- 
main for a few minutes, in water which has been poured on 
at the boiling temperature, and to avoid the extraction of 
tannin by making the period of steeping short. Tea must 
never be boiled. 

Utensils, — An earthen pot, measuring cup, teaspoon, 
strainer. Sometimes a tea ball or piece of cheesecloth. 

Proportion, — One teaspoonful of tea to about 1 cup of 
water, the amount depending upon the kind of tea. 

Method. — Measure the water and bring it to the boiling 
point. Heat the tea slightly in the pot, pour on the water 
rapidly, allow to stand three to five minutes, strain into a 
heated pot for serving. The length of the steeping depends ^ 
also upon the kind of tea. If there is an astringent flavor, the 
tea has stood too long. 

The following method was recommended by an expert in 
India teas. Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, throw 
in the tea leaves, lift the saucepan instantly to stop the boil- 
ing, steep for 3 or 4 minutes, strain ofif and keep hot. This 
expert claimed that by actually having the tea leaves at the 
boiling temperature for an instant the flavor is improved. 
Serve with cream or milk, or sliced lemon and sugar. 

Where tea is to be served in very large quantities, this last 
method is very convenient. The water can be brought to the 
boil in a large kettle, and the tea thrown in, but care must be 
exercised to see that the steeping does not last too long. The 
tea, once decanted, can be kept hot for several hours, without 
losing flavor. Or again, a small amount of extra strong tea 
may be prepared, to be diluted with boiling water as it is 
served. The tea ball, or the plan of tying the tea in small 
pieces of cheesecloth, is convenient for serving at an after- 
noon tea. 

7. Iced cocoa, coffee, and tea. 

Cocoa and coffee are agreeable in hot weather served in a 
glass with ice, and cream and powdered sugar. Make both 



86 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

slightly stronger than for hot drinks, as the ice in melting 
dilutes the liquid. 

Iced tea. — Prepare a small amount of strong tea, using 4 
teaspoonfuls to 1 cup boiling water, strain off and cool. Dilute 
with iced water to the proper strength, sweeten with powdered 
sugar, and serve in glasses witli one or two slices of lemon to 
each glass. For those who do not like the lemon, iced tea may 
be served with cream. 

EXERCISES 

1. l^hat are the functions of water in the body? 

2. What cautions should be exercised when drinking water? 

3. Explain the likenesses and differences of cocoa and chocolate, 
coffee and tea. 

4. Why is it better to serve whipped cream with cocoa, rather 
than with chocolate? 

5. Explain the principles in making each beverage. 



Teacher's Note. — The beverages are treated in one chapter for con- 
venience, but need not of necessity come at the beginning of the course. 
A fruit beverage, or cocoa, may make a convenient first lesson, when the 
pupils are becoming acquainted with the school kitchen. Coffee and tea 
may be made during the baking lessons. 



CHAPTER VI 
FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 

The United States is fortunate in the native fruit supply, 
including as it does so many degrees of latitude and longitude 
with the differences in altitude, climate, and soil needed by 
different varieties. Now that we count Porto Rico among 
our possessions, a list of our fruits would include most of the 
varieties known in the temperate and semi-tropical zones. 
The United States Department of Agriculture experiments 
with new varieties from foreign lands that may make them- 
selves at home in our soil, and work like that of Luther Bur- 
bank produces new species. Scientific methods of fruit 
growing are becoming more common, and the quality of 
fruit will doubtless improve in spite of fungous diseases and 
injurious insects. Our wild fruits are not yet entirely rooted 
out. The Maine blueberry, for example, is found on hundreds 
of acres and needs no cultivation beyond burning over every 
third jear. 

Fruit is necessary in our diet, and is not an extravagance 
unless we buy fancy varieties brought from a distance, or 
native fruits out of season. 

Composition and nutritive value. — The chief foodstuffs 
in fruits are carbohydrates and mineral ipatter. Fresh 
fruit contains from 75 to 95 per cent of water, and its presence 
is apparent in such juicy fruits as the melon and the orange. 
Figure 25 shows that seemingly dry fruits like the banana 
and the apple also (contain much water. Even fruits which 
have been artificially dried, like prunes and raisins, (contain

some water. (Fig. 26.) Although the carbohydrates of fruits 
are largely in the form of sugars easily digested and valuable 
as fuel, this kind of food is especially valuable for its rich 
supply of ash, iccluding the compounds of calcium, magne- 
sium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron. The iron is of great 
importance, being in a form much more useful to the normal

of the body than that prescribed medicinally. 
The bulk given by cellulose, and the laxative property of 
fruit acids also are safeguards against constipation, especially 
in a meat diet. Fruit is the best possible dessert after a 
hearty meat dinner. 

The digestibility of fruit is increased for some people by 
cooking. This is probably due to the softening of the fiber, 
to the destruction of any bacteria present, and in the case of 
the banana, to the cooking of the starch. Fruit juice can 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 91

be taken by little children and invalids who might find the 
fiber troublesome. Some people cannot eat berries on ac- 
count of irritation caused by the seeds. In this case, juice 
may be squeezed from cooked berries and used for beverages 
and jelly. 

How to buy. — Since we should eat fruit daily, and not 
merely as a " treat," it is important to practice economy in 
buying it. Fresh fruits in season, and dried fruits are the 
cheapest. Canned fruit is economical when it is a product 
of one's own garden, or put up when some fruit has a low 
market price. Prices are so variable, even with one variety, 
that no definite sum can be given as a fixed price. Apples 
vary from fifty cents a bushel near the orchard and in season, 
to ten cents apiece for a fancy table variety in the winter. 
When you buy fresh fruit, inquire the prices of the many kinds 
offered, note which is cheapest, and then observe whether 
the cheaper kind is such because it is abundant, or because it 
is of inferior quality. If you chance to want apples for cook- 
ing, and the only cheap apples are spotted and bruised, then 
buy dried apples, or even canned. It is best to decide upon 
the fruit after you have studied market conditions rather than 
before.

sliced and served with sugar and cream. 
Fruit juice. — Cut the fruit in two, and press on the glass squeezer 

over a cup. 

Cooked Fruits 
Principles of cooking. 
The fiber, and skin when retained, are softened. 
Flavors are developed at a low temperature long continued. A 
high temperature at the end of process, browns, and adds 
flavor. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 93 

Flavors retained by prevention of evaporation through covering 

tightly. 
Bacteria and molds are destroyed. 
Adjuncts. — Sugar. Sometimes a bit of butter. 
Acid fruit juices, or 
An acid jelly. 

Seeded raisins, with acid fruit, as sour apples. 
Nutmeg or cinnamon with some fruits. 
Cooking processes. — Stewing and baking. 
Utensils. — Knife and corer. 
Stew pan, enamel ware, close cover. 
Round or square baking pans, enamel ware, covered. 
Earthenware pot, covered. 
Methods. — If you can cook one fruit, you can cook all. Two 
common fruits are selected for your experiments, the apple 
and the prune ; both are delicious, and both contain iron, 
the prune more than the apple. 

The apple. — A tart variety is best for cooking. The Greening 

and the Baldwin are excellent. 
Apples are cooked whole, or as a sauce. 
Whohf cooked with or without the skin, either stewed or 

baked. 
For cooking whole, select those of uniform size. 
For cooking whole, with the skin, select those with fair skins. 
For cooking whole without skini select firm texture, not mellow. 
An apple sauce may consist of slices, or may be mashed or strained, 

and may be either stewed or baked. Less perfect apples 

may be used than for baking. 
First step for all. — Wash, and examine carefully for blemishes, 

bruises, and insects in the interior. 

I. Whole apple baked, with skin. 

(1) Remove core. 

(2) Place in pan, with enough water to barely cover the 

bottom of the pan. 

(3) Pour sugar into the holes. 

(4) A bit of butter may be put on the top of the sugar. 

(5) Nutmeg or cinnamon may be mixed with the sugar if 

the apples are flat in taste. 



94 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) Cover the pan, and bake in a moderate oven, until the 
apples are tender. The length of time depends upon 
the quality of the apple. (See class experiment.) 
Half apples. — This is a modification of (1). 

Cut the apples in two crosswise, and proceed as with the 
whole apple. 

2. Whole apples baked, without skin. — A good method when skins 

are tough. 

(1) Remove core and pare. 

(2) Place in earthen baking dish. The remainder of the 

process is the same. 

(3) Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

(4) Currant jelly, or seeded raisins may be placed in the core 

holes instead of sugar. 

Class experiment. — Bake side by side two apples of uniform 
size, one with, one without, the skin. Note carefully the length 
of time for baking each. What difference? Why is this? It 
may be necessary in the school kitchen to bake in a quick oven, 
on account of the shortness of the class period. It does not spoil 
the apple to do this ; but the longer process that you can use at 
home gives a richer color and flavor. 

For this experiment, one pupil may bake the apple without the 
skin, and the next pupil one with the skin in case there is but one 
apple apiece ; or it may be made a class experiment with two apples. 

3. Whole, stewed. (Compote.) — This is a more difficult method 

than method 2, and really no better. 

(1) Core and pare five or six apples. 

(2) Dissolve i cup sugar in J pint water in a saucepan. 

(3) Place apples in the sirup. They should be barely 

covered. ' 

(4) Cover closely and keep just below the boiling point, 

until the apples are tender. 

(5) Cool slightly, remove the apples with care and place in 

the serving dish. Put a spoonful of jelly in each apple. 

(6) Boil down the sirup and pour it over the apples. 

(7) Chill, before serving with plain or whipped cream. 

4. Apple sauces. — In the cooking of the whole apple you have 

all the principles and processes of apple cooking. You 
can now make apple sauce of your own invention, and need 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 95 

no printed directions. Answer these questions before you 
begin work. After you have made the sauce, record the 
work exactly in your notebook. 

If you want the slices of apple to remain whole, will the method 
be like i, 2, or 3? 

If you wish a smooth sauce, what utensil will you need? 

How will you determine the amount of sugar required? If 
you are very fond of sugar, your taste may not be the safest guide. 

Practical home work. — If you can secure a very slow oven, say a 
coal oven at night, or a gas oven with a low flame, make an apple 
sauce in an earthenware pot, as heavy as a bean pot, closely covered, 
leaving the pot in the oven from six to eight hours. This process is 
satisfactory in a fireless cooker where a hot stone or iron is used. 
Remember that water keeps down temperature, and also that it 
evaporates steadily even in a slow oven. How much water will you 
put over the apples when the process begins? 

If you have never cooked apples in this way you will be sur- 
prised at the color and flavor. 

Some other fruits. — Pears and quinces develop pleasing flavors 
when baked. 

Cook the quinces sliced, as suggested for the apples, in the bean 
pot, using a little molasses for sweetening and you will have the 
delicious old-time " molasses quince.'* 

Prunes. — We are dealing now with a dried fruit. If you com- 
pare the raisins with the grapes in Fig. 26, you will see how much 
water is lost in the drying process. The same difference would be 
evident if you had pictures of a fresh plum and a prune, side by side. 
This water must be supplied in the process of preparation. The 
best way to accomplish this is by soaking the prunes many hours, 
say over night. Prunes have a most undeserved reputation, because 
they are not well cooked, and at some tables are served too often. 

With this one new step introduced you may plan the cooking 
of the prunes, from what you know of apple sauce. The slower 
and longer the process, the better. The cheaper kinds of prunes 
will be very satisfactory, with the soaking and slow cooking. What 
is the sensible thing to do in regard to sugar? 

If on some occasion you would like prunes to be unusually nice, 
remove the stones carefully, and in their places slip in seeded raisins 
which have also been soaked and gently stewed. 



96 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other dried fruits may be treated in the same way. 
Apricots and peaches yield delightful flavors when carefully 
prepared ; and dried apples are also excellent. 

Preservation op Fruit and Other Foods 

The preservation of fruit and other foods has been a house- 
hold industry for generations, and it is now an important 
commercial industry. The old-time farm had its smoke- 
house where hams and beef were " cured/' the barrel of brine 
stood in the cellar for pork and corned beef, apples and 
com were dried for winlter use, and rows of preserve jars 
stood upon the shelves. Food was preserved by simple 
processes long before the reason for the decay and spoiling 
of food was fully understood, but with larger knowledge and 
better appliances, we now preserve food more effectively and 
in quantities larger than were possible in former days. 

Fruit is the food material now most commonly preserved 
in the home kitchen. Vegetables need to be subjected to 
heat for a much longer time than fruit, and many people 
prefer to buy canned vegetables rather than to go to the 
trouble and expense of canning them at home. Where 
there is an oversupply of vegetables in the home garden, it 
is sometimes economy to can them, and this may be done if 
care is exercised. The cost of fuel and labor must be coimted 
in, when studying the question of home preserving versus 
buying the canned product. 

Whatever the food material, and the process, the principles 
of preservation are the same for all. 

Why does food spoil? — The decay and moldiness of 
fresh fruit are matters of common observation; and the 
housekeeper knows that mold is liable to cover the top of a 
jelly glass, and that a can of fruit will ferment at times, 
even to the point of bursting the can. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 



97 



We recognize another kind of deterioration in meat and 
fish that have become tainted, even when no mold is visible, 
and there is no opportunity for ordinary fermentation. The 
microscope has given us eyes to see, and as a result of the 
patient work of the scientist with this instrument we now 
know that the difficulties in keeping food are caused by the 
presence of minute vegetable organisms known as molds, 





Fio. 28. — Three species of mold. 

yeasts, and bacteria. It is impossible in some cases to draw 
a sharp line between these different forms of lower life, yet 
we are able to distinguish them sufficiently for practical 
purposes. 

Masses of mold that can be seen with the naked eye are 
distinguished by a feathery appearance and bright color. 
Figure 28 shows three species of the green mold that aifects 
jam and jellies. Other species are found in Roquefort 
and Camembert cheese, and give the flavors characteristic 
in these cheeses. 

The presence of yeast can be detected by its action, but it 
cannot itself be seen without the microscope. When canned 
fruit or homemade fruit juice " works," yeasts cells are 



98 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

present in great number. Figure 29 shows one form of 
yeast, highly magnified, and Fig. 30 shows a single yeast 
cell. The yeast cake is a mixture of thousands of such cells 




— One form of yeast. 

with some flour or flour and meal, and the cells lie dormant 

in the cake, until we are ready to use them in bread. (See 

Chapter XII.) The actual yeast, however, \s what Fig. 

30 shows it to be, a tiny, one-celled 

plant, increasing in number by the 

^ division ot the single cell, or by the 

budding out of one cell from another. 

" When conditions are favorable the 

yeast cells increase in number with 

great rapidity, and some of the sugar 

that is present is broken down into 

cgranuiM. d, nuci™a. e and carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. It 

*■ '■ is this gas that causes the familiar 

bubbling when fermentation is taking place. We put yeast 

cells into bread and cultivate it for this gas. But how do^ 

it occur in canned fruits, when its presence is not desired? 

Wild yeast floats in the air, and lies upon the surface of fruit. 

All cultivated yeast has been derived from wild yeast. In 

old-fashioned ways of bread-making no yeast was introduced, 



A yeaat cell. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 99 

a soft dough being left in a warm place to ferment naturally, 
the yeast cells probably being present in the flour. The 
yeast that spoils the canned fruit is present in the fruit, in 
the utensiHs, or can, and has not been killed as it should be 
in the canning process. 

The bacteria are also one-celled microorganisms, smaller 
than the yeast. Figure 31 shows the four tjT>es of bacterial 
cells. Their siae is measured by the unit used in the 




— Tfie tour types of bacterii 
C. spirilla. I>, branched Blan 



microscope, called the micron, which is about ytW of on* 
inch. Bacteria may measure from one to three or four of 
these microns in length. Some bacteria are reproduced by 
means of spores which form within the cell. Bacteria, as 
they develop in some material, produce substances from the 
material that may or may not be injurious to us. One im- 
portant truth about the bacteria is this : that many of them 
are harmless, and may even be made useful, as in the 
manufacture of fruit vinegar. The pleasant acid of butter- 
milk and of sour milk is due also to bacteria which are 
not harmful to us. However, there may be disease pro- 
ducing bacteria present in milk that is not clean, and 
their presence must not be tolerated. Other bacteria, de- 



100 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

veloping in meat and fish, produce substances known as 
ptomaines, which are dangerous poisons ; or, more often, the 
kinds of bacteria which thrivQ in meats and fish may them- 
selves be directly injurious to man. 

It is evident, therefore, that the problem before us is the 
control of these lower organisms, that we may increase or 
destroy them as we will. 

The control of microorganisms. — With warmth, water, 
and food all living things flourish and grow ; most organisms 
require air, but some of the microorganisms do not. Where 
these conditions are best met, the organism is most active 
and multiplies most rapidly. To retard growth or to destroy 
life, the conditions must be the reverse of favorable. While 
warmth, say a temperature from 70® to 90® F., promotes the 
life of most microorganisms, intense heat destroys it. The 
boiling temperature, 212® F., will kill these lower organisms, 
although this heat has to be continued for some length of 
time, particularly in the case of spores. The spores of 
certain bacteria are quite resistant. A temperature of 32® F. 
and lower retards growth, but it requires extreme cold to 
destroy bacteria. Since moisture is necessary to all the lower 
organisms, they do not develop in a dry material or dry 
place. 

We cannot destroy these lower forms of life by removing 
food from them, since they are ever present, but we can 
make the food unavailable to them through the introduction 
in the material of certain substances called preservatives 
which prevent their growth. The preservatives long familiar 
are salt, sugar, wood-smoke, spices, vinegar, and alcohol. 
While a small amount of sugar is necessary in the fermenta- 
tion process, a large amoimt acts as a preservative, as in 
candied fruit. It is an interesting fact that alcohol and 
vinegar, products of fermentation processes, tend (when 



«» *

Fi^CZ/r AND ITS PRESERVATION :l':'\lQh 

sufficiently concentrated) to stop the growth of the fermen- 
tation organisms. 

To the reader who desires a fuller account of the bacteria, 
yeast, and molds, especially as related to household affairs, 
Buchanan's '* Household Bacteriology" is recommended as 
the most recent and satisfactory book in this field. 

A word about buying canned goods. — When canned goods 
are put up in large quantities at the factory, abuses are likely 
to exist. Poor, even decayed, fruit may be used, the whole 
process may be unclean from beginning to end, and unde- 
sirable preservatives or an excess of sugar or spice may be in- 
troduced to cover the use of poor materials or methods. The 
condition of the worker in the cannery is one of the important 
industrial problems at the present time. Unhappily, poor 
conditions do often exist in canneries that turn out a cheap 
product. On the other hand, there are firms that may well 
take pride in their system from beginning to end. 

Serving canned food. — All canned food should be ex- 
posed to the air for a short time before serving, and stirred 
that the material may be aerated. This partially removes a 
certain flatness of taste. Canned fruit is improved by re- 
heating, even. 

When possible, vegetables bought in a tin can should be 
washed in the colander before they are heated. This greatly 
improves the flavor. 

Principles of preservation. 
Sterilization of food and all apparatus by the boiling tempera- 
ture, 2120 F. 
The removal of moisture by some drying process. 
The addition of a preservative. 
Sealing, to prevent the entrance of air. 

Practical methods. 
Canning, — Fruit or vegetables sterilized at 212® F. and tightly 
sealed in jars or cans.

and allowing the water to reach the boiling point and to boil for 
half an hour. Covers and rubber rings should be treated in the 
same way. 

Prepare the fruit by careful washing, picking over, paring and 
nutting. 

The skins may be loosened on peaches and tomatoes by pouring 
hot water over them. 

Weigh both fruit and sugar, or measure if no scales are available. 

See that the cooking apparatus is in good order, that the proper 
heat may be continued. 

Avoid rapid boiling of the fruit. 



104 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Plaoe the cans when they ore to be filled with hot fruit upon a 
towel wet in very hot water, or in a pan holding: an inch or so of 
hot water. Never hold the can or glass in the hand. 

Use a dipper for putting cooked fruit into the oan. A funnel is 
useful placed in the mouth of the jar. 

Put whole fruit and halves compactly in the jar, using table- 
spoon and fork, or two tablespoons. It requires practice to do this 
well. 

See that all air bubbles are removed, and fill the cans to over- 
flowing, before putting on the glass tops and fastening on the spring. 
Wipe off the jars, carefully, and stand them on their tops for a day 
in order to test the tightness of the rubbers and the fastening. 

After filling jelly glasses, set them at one side, and cover them 
all with a piece of cheesecloth, until the jelly becomes firm. Then 
pour melted paraffin upon the jelly in each glass, and when the 
paraffin is cooled, put the covers on firmly. 

Label the jars with the name of the fruit and the date of the 
preserving before putting them away. 

Canning. 

Method 1. — Material cooked before it is put into the can. This 
is a good method for berries, and for fruit that will be served as a 
sauce. Proceed in the preparation and finishing according to the 
general directions. Cook the fruit gently for half an hour. Use 
as little water as possible. No sugar is required in the canning pro- 
cess, but the fiavor is better if a small amount is used in the begin- 
ning, a half cup of sugar to a pound of fruit. 

Method 2, — Material cooked in the can. This is the better 
method for whole fruit and halves. Select firm, well-shaped fruit 
for this method, rejecting the mellow and soft fruit. Pack the cans 
tightly with the fruit, and pour in hot water with sugar dissolved 
in it, a half cup to the quart can. More sugar can be used, if 
so desired. Set the jars in a boiler on a rack, and surround them 
with warm water, to a height that will not allow the water to boil" 
into the cans. 

Set the cover on each jar, but do not fasten them. Cover the 
boiler closely, bring the water to a boil, and allow it to boil for an 
hour. At the end of this time, test the fruit for tenderness with a 
fork, pour in more sirup if it is necessary. Remove the jars when 
the water has cooled sufficiently, and adjust the covers. Cold 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 105 

water is sometimes used at the begimiing, but this makes the 
process longer. 

This is a good method also for the oamiing of whole vegetables 
like peas and asparagus. The cooking of vegetables should con- 
tinue for at least two hours, and three hours are better for peas and 
string beans. 

Apparatus is constructed for this method of canning, but the 
ordinary boiler answers the purpose. 

Preserving. 

A good method for peached, apricots, and quinces. Select firm 
and handsome fruit and prepare it carefully. Allow a i)ound of 
sugar to a i)ound of fruit. (What is the measure of a pound of 
sugar?) Place enough water in the kettle to cover the fruit, dis- 
solve the sugar in the water, put the fruit into the kettle, and cook 
very gently until the fruit becomes a clear color. Rapid boiling 
spoils the shape of the fruit. Do not stir at all, but skim off any 
scum that rises to the top. When the fruit is done, put it with 
great care into the jars. If the sirup is thin, boil it down for a 
short time, and then fill the jar. Close the jar as in canning. 

This is a difficult process for beginners. 

Jam making, and fruit butter. 

This is the most economical of the preserving processes and the 
easiest for the novice. It is nothing more than a fruit sauce, with 
a larger amount of sugar than usual to assist in its preservation. 

Soft and somewhat imperfect fruit may be used. If in the 
basket of fruit bought for canning or preserving there are some 
fuUy ripe or pdorly shaped specimens, these may be used for jam. 
For jam proper allow a pint of sugar to a i)ound of fruit. Cook the 
fruit with enough water to prevent its sticking to the kettle, using 
as little as possible. 

Mash the fruit by stirring it occasionally as it cooks. When the 
fruit is soft, add the sugar, stir thoroughly, and cook gently for 
about five minutes. Test by cooling a siMonful on a saucer. The 
jam should thicken slightly. When ready, pour it into jelly glasses, 
or somewhat larger earthen jars — " jam pot^." Seal, as directed 
for jelly. 

The fruit butter is even more like fruit sauce than is the jam, for 
it is softer than jam, and contains less sugar. A cup or only a half 



106 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

oup of sugao: to the pound of fruit is enough. Proceed exactly as 
in jam-making. 

Apple huUer may be flavored with spices, with ginger root and 
lemon juice, and with other fruits. One or two quinces or a slice 
of pineapple cooked with the apples gives a pleasing variety. 
Exercise the inventive faculty here. 

Jelly making. — There is another principle involved in jelly 
making in addition to the principle of preservation. Fruit contains 
a substance known as pectose, one of the carbohydrates, that 
partially solidifies the fruit juice when the water in the juice is 
partially evaporated. The addition of sugar helps in this process, 
but no amount of sugar will set the jelly if the pectose is not present. 
Some fruits have more than others, and also more when not over- 
ripe. Currants and firm apples are good jelly makers, and serve 
as a basis for other fruits that do not jelly well. Mellow summer 
apples do not set well. Crab apples are excellent for this pur- 
pose. 

There is another step in this process, the straining out of the 
juice from the pulp. For this, prepare a jelly bag from firm cotton 
cloth which has been boiled and washed. This bag must be hung 
in such a way that the juice drops from the point of the bag into a 
bowl below. It may be hung upon a stick between two chairs, or 
upon the rod of a strong towel rack over a table. 

I. Apple jelly. — Select tart, red-skinned apples, cut them in small 
pieces with the skins on, retain the cores, and put them in 
a kettle with cold water to barely cover. When thoroughly 
cooked and mashed, put this pulp into the jelly bag, and 
allow the juice to drip as long as it will. Do not squeeze 
the bag, nor stir the pulp if you wish clear jelly. This drip- 
ping process is a matter of hours, and in the home kitchen 
may continue all night. Allow a pint of sugar to a pint of 
juice. Return the juice to the kettle, and allow it to simmer 
for twenty-five minutes or half an hour, skimming when 
necessary. In the meantime, heat the sugar, being careful 
not to melt or bum it. Stir the sugar gently into the juice, 
and boil five minutes. Test a little upon a saucer. It should 
show signs of jellying as it cools. Boil longer, if necessary. 
Finish as directed. Jelly often does not set until twenty-four 
hours have elapsed. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 107 

2. Currant jelly. — The method is the same as with apple jelly. 
It is not necessary to remove the ciirrants from the stem. 
Heat just long enough before the straining to make the juices 
flow well. 

Very agreeable flavors are secured by the combining of two 
or more fruits in a jelly ; quince and pineapple with apple ; 
— a leaf of rose geranium or lemon verbena in a glass of apple 
jelly; raspberry with currant. White apple jelly may be 
flavored with mint leaves, and used in place of mint sauce with 
meat. 

Pickling. 

Pickles are not desirable in the diet. If acid is craved, it is 
much wiser to secure it by fresh fruits, and by the use of lemon 
juice. 

Drying. 

This process should not be discarded if there is a supply of fruit 
in the orchard or garden. Place thinly sliced apples and peaches 
upon plates or trays, protect by clean cheesecloth, and dry in the 
sun. The color may be dark, but the flavor is excellent.

but some fruit is available at any time of year: in the winter, apple and 
peach butter from the dried fruit; in the spring rhubarb jam or jelly; in the 
late spring or early summer, strawberry jam. If the school program and the 
equipment permit the serving of meals by the class, fruit may be preserved 
in the fall for these occasions.

CHAPTER VII 
VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 

• 

The distinction between the fruit and the vegetable is 
purely arbitrary, since both are parts of plants and have the 
same general composition. Botanically the tomato is as 
truly a fruit as the apple ; but when it is stewed and served 
with meat, it is classed as a vegetable. Other parts of 
plants, however, besides the fruit are used as vegetables. 

Composition and nutritiye value. — Vegetables are much 
like fruits in composition, being richest usually in carbohy- 
drates and ash, but sometimes containing a large amount of 
protein. Some have carbohydrates in the form of starch, 
as the potato, and others in the form of sugar, as the beet ; 
young com is rich in sugar, old com in starch. All have 
more or less cellulose, that in lettuce being very tender, 
while that in beets is so firm as to be softened only by 
long cooking. Study carefully Figs. 34 and 35. Notice how 
the amoimt of water compares with the amount in fruits. 
See, too, that beans, both green and dry, are richer in protein 
than other vegetables. Celery has the highest percentage 
of water, and is valuable for its ash and the bulk it gives 
because of the large amount of cellulose. 

To explain these facts we must understand something of 

the physiology of the plant. The stem is the carrier of water 

and nutritive material to other parts of the plant. The 

onion bulb, the parsnip root, and the potato tuber are the 

winter storehouses of food for the next year's plant when the

leaves first sprout. In the dry bean seed, and also in the 
pea and lentil, the young plant lies dormant, with a large 
supply of all the foodstuffs ready for its. first growth when 
warmth and moisture are supplied in the spring. Classified 
according to their nutritive value, the vegetables rank as 
follows. Leaves are grouped with stems. 

The seeds Contain all the foodstuffs. High in 

protein. 
Roots and tubers Contain all the foodstuffs. Low in 

and the bulb protein and fat. High in starch 

or some form of sugar. 
Rinds (squash and Contain all the foodstuffs in small 
pumpkin) amounts. Mineral content the 

chief value. 
Leaves and stems Mineral content the chief value. 

Certain substances in some vegetables are supposed to have 
a physiological effect, but we should be cautious in accepting 
statements that have not been scientifically proved; for 
instance, that celery is "good for the nerves." It is doubt- 
less true that the oils which give onions and the cabbage 
their strong flavors do not agree with some people, and these 
vegetables should be eaten with caution. 

How to buy. — Much interest is added to the study of 
vegetables by the examination of a seed catalogue easily 
obtainable from a firm selling seeds and plants. In this 
way, one may increase one's knowledge of varieties for 
planting in the home garden, even if they are not common on 
the market. City markets offer an increasing variety of 
vegetables, and the purchaser should not hesitate to buy a 
vegetable because it is new to her. An inexpensive Italian 
vegetable, fenucchi, is now sometimes found on sale, and its 
characteristic flavor is very agreeable.

114 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The season of vegetables is so extended by canning, by 
the shipping of vegetables from the South, and by/ growing 
under glass that there is always a wide range of choice. 
There are in winter, however, some tempting delicacies in 
the way of green vegetables that the buyer with a limited 
purse should pass by. A cucumber at fifty cents or even at 
ten cents is not a sensible purchase. Lettuce, grown under 
glass, at ten cents a head is not an extravagance, if the in- 
come allows thirty-five to forty cents per capita per day for 
food. As a rule, select the less expensive vegetable, provided 
it is in good condition. The prices are so fluctuating that a 
definite statement is impossible. (See Chapter XVII.) 

Root vegetables should be imiforin in size, sound, the skins fair. 

Head vegetables should be solid, with but few waste leaves on 
the outside. 

. Vegetables with hard rind should be sound and firm. 

Asparagus should be even in size, the stalks not bitten by insects. 

Cauliflower should be firm and white, not affected by insects 
or blight. 

Celery should be firm and white, free from blemishes, fine in 
texture. 
. . Pea^ should have crisp pods well filled, but not too full. 

String beans should be crisp and snap easily. 

All leaf vegetables should be crisp — not wilted. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Uncooked vegetables. — Crisp vegetables with tender fiber are 
eaten raw. Their preparation includes freshening in cold water, 
thorough washing to remove grit and insects, thorough drying by 
shaking in a soft cloth or wire basket, and cooling on the ice. Let- 
tuce should not be served so wet that the water collects on the plate, 
making it impossible to dress the salad with oil. See salad making, 
Chapter XV. 

Cooked vegetables. — Vegetable cooking is an art much neg- 
lected, and in consequence vegetables are sometimes served lacking 
their proper flavor and their original nutrients. To cook vege- 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 115 

tables in boiling salted water, throwing the water away, is not the 
oorreot method, except in a few eases. With this method much of 
the valuable mineral matter and the flavoring substances are lost 
in the water. With such strong flavored vegetables as the cabbage, 
old onions and beets, and old potatoes this method is permissible, 
but even in these cases the nutritive value is decreased. 

Principles of cooking. — Softening of the fiber. 

Opening of the starch granules, when starch is present, at a tem- 
peratiure of 212® F. Retaining mineral and flavoring matters. 

Cooking processes. — These rank in value as they do or do not 
retain the mineral and flavoring matters. 

Baking. — No nutritive material lost. The best method for 
potatoes and sweet potatoes. Used also for squash, pumpkin, 
beets, young onions, dried beans, peas, and lentils. 

Steaming. (Cooking in a steamer.) — No nutritive material lost. 
A good method for all fresh vegetables. Steamed veget^^bles have 
less flavor than baked. 

Stewing, — Cooking in a stew pan or kettle with so little water 
that it is almost boiled out at the end of the process, any remaining 
liquid being served with the vegetable. The best method for 
spinach, which can be cooked with no additional water, beyond that 
remaining on the leaves from the washing. The French use this 
method almost entirely, and with tender peas and carrots they omit 
water and use butter only. A substitute for this latter is a very 
small amoimt of water, with the addition of butterine or some good 
butter substitute. 

Boiling, — Cooking in a large amount of boiling, salted water, 
the water to be drained off and thrown away. May be used with 
old beets of rank flavor, strpng onions, old potatoes, or potatoes 
boiled with the skins on. A wasteful method. 

Adjuncts. — Salt, pepper, butter, or some other fat, milk, cheese, 
bread crumbs, parsley, eggs. 

Utensils. — A vegetable brush, a sharp knife, a chopper, a po- 
tato masher, a strainer, a colander, a stew pan, kettle or steamer, 
baking pan, baking dish, bean pot, frying pan or kettle. 

General directions. — Wash the vegetables, scrubbing the skin 
vegetables with a brush. Washing in several waters is important 
with spinach to remove all grit. Scrape off thin skins or pare off 
the thicker. Thick skins such as those of old beets are more easily 



/' 



116 FOOD& AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

removed after cooking. The outer covering must be removed in the 
case of peas, shell beans, and sweet corn. Pull or cut strings from 
string beans with great care. Discard all poor portions. Remove and 
throw away the inner pulp and seeds of old squashes and pumpkins. 
The whole of a tender summer squash is eatable. 

When boiling salted water is used, allow one tablespoonful of 
salt to four quarts of Water. Steamed and stewed vegetables are 
salted and dressed with butter or butter substitute before serving. 
Butter is a better dressing for vegetables than white sauce. Where 
cream is available, nothing is so delicious. Use white sauce very spar- 
ingly with some escalloped vegetable for variety. Making a sauce 
adds to the labor of preparation, and the sauce hides the delicious 
flavor of a well-cooked vegetable. Some vegetables are mashed 
before serving; potatoes, turnip, squash, either boiled or baked. 

Time of cooking. — The foDowing table is a guide, but one must 
learn from practice, for the time depends upon the quality of the 
vegetable, whether tender or tough, and upon the size whether large 
or small. Test by gently inserting a fork. 

Allow more time for cooking in a steamer, than for stewing or 
boiling. It requires more time to bake a potato than to boil one of 
the same size. Why? 

Time-table 

(For stewing and boiling unless stated otherwise.) 

Fifteen minutes. — Tender cabbage and sweet corn. These are 
usually cooked too long. 

Thirty minutes. — Asparagus ; peas ; potatoes of medium size ; 
summer squash ; tomatoes. 

Forty-five minutes. — Young beets and carrots ; onions ; yoimg 
parsnips ; medium potatoes baked, sweet potatoes boiled. 

One hour. — String and shelled beans ; cauliflower ; oyster plant ; 
winter squash, steamed or baked ; young turnips. 

Two hours. — Old carrots, beets, and turnips. 

Six to eight hours {or more). — Dried beans, lentils, and peas, 
baked in the oven, with water added. 

The potato, a starchy vegetable. — Make it your pride to serve 
a plain potato, mealy and inviting. Potatoes are " new," fully 
ripe, and old. The new potato is in market in July and August, 
and may be recognized by its very thin skin. The later potatoes 
have a thicker skin, the color still being fresh. In the spring after 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 117 

its winter storage, the potato is *' old.*' It -seems a little less firm, 
the color of the exterior is somewhat changed ; perhaps the buds in 
the eyes of the potato are beginning to grow. When cooked it has 
a stronger flavor, and rather darker color. If the potato has been 
frozen, a sweet flavor is developed, and the quality is waxy. Po- 
tatoes are sometimes inferior in quality when the season is a poor 
one, or when some potato disease is prevalent. The following classi- 
fication shows you in how many ways potatoes may be cooked, and 
also shows you how easy it is to classify recipes in an orderly way. 

I. Potatoes cooked whole.

6. Without skin. 

2. Boiled. 

a. With skin. 

b. Without skin. 

3. Baked.

6. Creamed. From either cold boiled or baked j)otatoes ; 

the latter are better. 
c. Saut^. 

(a) Sliced and browned. 

(b) Hashed and browned. 

If you know some other method, see if you can fit it into this 
grouping. 

X. Baked potatoes. 

Method 1, The best method, for new potatoes. Select those 
of uniform size. When scrubbed, place them in a shallow 



118 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

pan, or upon the rack of the oven. The oven should be hot, 
about 450® F. or even a higher temperature. (See oven tests, 
Chapter IX.) The length of time required depends upon the 
size of the potato, forty-five minutes being the average time. 

A potato is largely water. What is the temperature of the 
interior of the potato during the baking process ? 

Test by pressing firmly, protecting the fingers by a soft cloth ; 
or insert a fork. When the potato is done, it yields to the 
pressure of the finge^rs. If the potatoes cannot be served at 
once, break the skin that the steam may escape, cover with a 
cloth, and keep them hot. 

For convenience at the table, cut the potatoes in two length- 
wise, loosen the content of each half with a fork, sprinkle with salt, 
and add a bit of butter, as much as one would add at the table. 

Potato on the half shell carries serving one step farther. 
Cut the baked potatoes in two lengthwise, remove the con- 
tents, mash lightly, add butter or butterine, milk, and salt, al- 
lowing a teaspoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of milk and a 
shake or two of salt to each potato. These measurements can- 
not be given with exactness , because potatoes vary in size. Beat 
this mixture well, replace lightly in each half shell, and brown 
the tops slightly. This is nothing more than mashed baked 
potato, prettily served. 

Invent other variations of this dish, adding ingredients that 
are agreeable when mixed with the potato. The beaten white 
of an egg added, gives greater lightness to the mixture in the 
potato shell. 

Method 2. The same as Method 1, except that the potatoes 
are pared before baking. A good method when the skins are 
not fair. A brown crust is formed on the potato, which is 
crisp and pleasant to eat. Large potatoes may be out in two 
before baking, or even sliced. 

What difference in length of baking will there be between 
Methods 1 and 2 ? 

2. Boiled potatoes. 

The only way to prevent the loss of nutrients in using this 
process is to boil the potatoes with the " jackets " on. This 
is the best way with new potatoes. This method with ripe 
and old potatoes gives a yellowish color to the surface and 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 119 

indeed throughout. It is a labor-saving method for the busy 
housewife, as the skin eracks and loosens at the end of the 
boiling process, and is easily removed. 

If you choose to have a snow-white potato, it must be pared 
before boiling, and thus you deliberately waste the valuable 
mineral matter provided by nature. If your income permits 
this sBsthetic pleasure, the mineral matter can of course be 
supplied in other vegetables. The woman who can spend but 
twenty to thirty cents per capita for food per day should boil 
the potatoes with the skins on and gratify her artistic sense in 
some other way. 

The method of boiling is the same in either case, whether the 
potato is pared or not. 

Have enough boiling water to cover the potatoes. Put the 
potatoes of uniform size one at a time into the kettle that 
the boiling may not stop. Allow a gentle boiling to continue 
until the potatoes are done. Why avoid rapid boiling? Test 
with a fork at the end of half an hour. When the potatoes 
are meUow, drain off the water, and set the kettle where the 
remaining moisture will steam off. Shake gently to hasten 
this process, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt. If they must 
stand before serving will you place a tin cover or a cloth over 
the kettle ? Old potatoes, with a strong flavor, should be pared 
before boiling, or even soaked in cold water. 

3* Mashed potatoes. — Some one devised this convenient method of 
serving, to save trouble at the table. Mashed potato can be 
very poor and unappetizing when wet and limipy. Do not at- 
tempt it with new, poor, or old potatoes. See that the boiled 
potatoes are as dry as can be — every particle of water steamed 
away. Mash thoroughly with the wire masher, add butter or 
butterine, salt and milk in about the proportions given for potato 
in the half shell. Use a tablespoonful or so of cream if it is avail- 
able. Beat vigorovsly. The mealiness of the potato and the 
vigorous beating are the secrets of success. The finished product 
should be light and somewhat moist, — not wet. Reheat in the 
kettle. Pile lightly in a hot dish and serve ; or brown the top 
before serving. 

Potato "puff, (Souffle.) — With your knowledge of mashed 
potato, can you not invent a potato puff ?

4. Escalloped potato. — The name escalloped is applied to any 

baked dish that is arranged in layers. Esoalloped potato 
is a palatable dish and this is one of the most economical of 
methods. 

Wash, pare, and slice the potatoes in i-inch pieces. Slightly 
grease an earthen or enameled baking dish. Cover the bottom 
of the dish with a layer of the slices, sprinkle the slices lightly 
with flour, and put on two teaspoonfuls of butter, or butterine, 
in small bits. Continue until the dish is nearly full. Pour 
in milk to barely cover the potatoes, put a cover on the dish 
and set the dish in an oven of 380° F. Remove the cover in 
time to allow the top to brown. Allow rather more than half 
an hour for the baking. 

5. Creamed potatoes. — Methodic an easy way. Chop cold baked 

potatoes with the chopper. Allow one tablespoonful of butter 
to 1 pint of chopped potato. Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
Stir in the potatoes. Shake from the dredger the equiva- 
lent of a tablespoonful of flour, stirring the potato with one 
hand as you shake with the other. Pour in enough milk to 
barely cover the chopped potato. Set the saucepan in the 
coolest spot on the range ; or on the simmering burner of a gas 
range, upon an asbestos mat; or turn all into an earthen- 
ware jar, or baking dish, and proceed as with escalloped potato. 
Allow the mixture to cook until it becomes creamy. 

Method 2, Cut the cold potatoes in cubes, and heat in a 
thin white sauce. See Chapter X. 

Boiled potatoes may be used, but baked are better in tex- 
ture and flavor for creaming. 

6. French fried potatoes. — Wash and pare small potatoes, cut in 

eighths lengthwise, and soak a few minutes in cold water. 
Take from water, dry between towels, and fry in deep fat. 
Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt. 

(1) Deep fat frying, — An iron kettle is the best for deep 
fat, 3 quarts a convenient size. A wire basket is almost neces- 
sary for frying soft material. 

Fill the kettle i full of fat and place over fire. When a 
slight blue smoke or vapor rises from it, it is ready to test. 
Test with small cubes of bread. If bread browns in 1 minute, 
the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures. If it browns 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 121 

in 10 seconds, it is right for cooked materials. Care must be 
taken to keep the temperatures at the right point, for if too cool, 
the material will soak fat ; if too hot, both fat and material to 
be cooked will bum. 

(2) To clarify fat, — Drop several slices raw, pared potato 
into the fat and let bubble up. Strain all through cheesecloth 
back into pail from which fat was taken. The potatoes seem 
to absorb food odors and collect crumbs and leave the fat 
clear. 

7. Stewed celery. — A green vegetable. Stalks of celery, too 

tough or coarse for serving imcooked, are delicious when 
stewed. The process is simple. Wash, scrape, and cut the 
stalks crosswise. Place them in a stewpan, barely cover with 
hot water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of celery. 
Cook gently for half an hour or until the celery is tender. Use 
the liquid remaining in making a sauce, adding some milk 
to make the necessary amount of liquid. Three fourths of a cup 
of sauce is enough for a pint of celery. See Chapter X. 

8. Cabbage. — The method given makes cabbage a delicious and 

attractive vegetable, as delicate as cauliflower, and the odor 
in the kitchen is not noticeable. 

Select a small cabbage, with the ribs in the leaves not too 
thick. Prepare the cabbage before washing it by cutting out 
the stalks from below with a sharp knife. Separate the leaves. 
Have ready the largest kettle available, nearly full of rapidly 
boiling water. Drop in one cabbage leaf at a time, pressing 
each one down with a long-handled spoon or skimmer. Do 
this so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. Leave the 
kettle uncovered, and allow the cabbage to cook from 12 to 
15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the leaf stalks. 
Remove the leaves with a long-handled skimmer, putting them 
into a colander standing on a plate. Immediately pour the hot 
water down the sink drain, turn ofi the cold water to flush 
away the odor, and fill the kettle with cold water. While 
the cabbage is cooking, you have made a pint of white sauce, 
No. 2 (Gh. X), adding a teaspoonful of salt, and have prepared 
i cup of buttered crumbs. Cut the cabbage leaves slightly, 
place them in a baking dish, pour the white sauce over them, 
sprinkle the crumbs on the top, and brown the crumbs in the 



122 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

oven or under the gas. If you can, prepare this as a surprise 
at home, and ask the family to " gfuess '' what it is. If the 
cabbage is a good one, some of the leaves turn a very pretty 
green with this method of boiling. 

9. Baked beans. — A nitrogenous vegetable and a meat substi- 
tute. A dish known in old days in New England, baked 
to perfection in the old brick oven. Baked beans seem diffi- 
cult of digestion for some people. The mustard is supposed 
to be helpful, and adds something to the flavor. If the mo- 
lasses is omitted, or but a small amount used, and if butter 
takes the place of pork or suet, the beans seem more digestible. 
In different parts of New England the dish is varied. Some 
people prefer rather dry baked beans, others wish them moist 
and very sweet. 

Utensils. — A kettle. A covered bean pot. 
Ingredients, — 1 quart of white beans. 

1 teaspoonful of soda. 
J lb. salt pork or more, or 
4 tablespoonfuls of beef fat or butter sub- 
stitute. 
Molasses, from two tablespoonfuls to i cup, 

or none, 
1 teaspoonful of mustard. 

Method, — Wash, and soak the beans in cold water over 
night. Pour off any water that remains. Put the beans into 
the kettle, cover with cold water, add the soda, and cook gently 
until the beans are slightly softened. The soda aids the soften- 
ing. Pour off the water again, and put the beans into the 
pot. Mix the molasses and mustard with a pint of water, and 
pour this over the beans, adding more water if the beans are 
not covered. Place the pork or other fat upon the beans, and 
cover the pot. If fat other than pork is used, salt must be 
added to the beans. The beans should bake slowly, for from 
6 to 8 hours, and even longer in a very slow oven. A stove 
. of the type shown in Fig. 17 is good for this purpose. They 

Laboratory management. — The last experiment is the only one not easily 
performed in the school kitchen. The process can begin perhaps on one day, 
and be finished the next. If there is some apparatus that cooks at a lo^ 
temperature, the practical difficulties may be overcome. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 123 

can be baked in the ordinary gas oven, if only one burner is 
used, and that is turned very low. 

Vegetable, or " cream ** soups. 

These are of two classes : the purees (porridge), or thick soups, 
with vegetable pulp as the thickening material, and the cream 
soups, which are somewhat thinner, the juices of some vegetable 
giving the flavor. 

Potato pur^e, or soup, is an example of the flrst; cream of 
tomato of the second. The line is not sharply drawn between the 
two in many cook books. Milk is an important ingredient in these 
soups, so that they are sometimes known as milk soups. Butter and 
flour are used in both, — the flour in the pur6e " binds " the 
mixture and makes it smoother; in the cream soup the flour is 
used for thickening as well. 

Dried beans, x>6as, or lentils make a delicious pur^e, the secret of 
success being long slow cooking in some low temperature appa- 
ratus. They are brought to perfection in the Atkinson Cooker. 

10. Potato Pure6. 

Ingredients. 

Potato 1 cup 

Milk 1 quart 

Flour 1 tablespoonful 

Butter 1 tablespoonful 

Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 
Celery stalks, cut small 1 teaspoonful 

Onion, chopped 1 tablespoonful 

Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks. — If a thicker pur6e is desired, use more of the 
mashed potato. If celery salt is used, omit one teaspoonful 
of the salt. Less onion may be used, and the pepper omitted. 

Utensils, — Make the list yourself, after reading the direc- 
tions for mixing. 

Method of mixing, — Boil and mash the potato, or use cold 
mashed potato. Heat the milk in the double boiler with the 
celery and onion. Add the milk gradually to the mashed po- 
tato, beating vigorously. 

Put this mixture through a strainer into the double boiler, 



124 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and reheat it. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, or stir in 
the flour, add slowly half a cup of the soup to the butter and 
flour paste, and then pour this slowly into the mixture in the 
double boiler, stirring all the time. The soup will be ready to 
serve in about ten minutes. 

The important point in this recipe is the quality of the 
mashed potato. It should be dry and light. It may be made 
from hot, mealy baked potatoes. If cold mashed potato is 
used, this should be made light again with a fork. An excel- 
lent luncheon dish. Will serve four to six people. 

1 1 . Cream of tomato soup. 

Ingredients. 

Tomato juice i cup 

Milk 1 quart 

Flour 2 tablespoonfuls 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 

Bicarbonate of soda i teaspoonful 

Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks, — Celery and onion may be added, but are not 
necessary. When you become expert, you will be able to 
use a larger amount of tomato juice, and even omit the soda. 

Method of mixing. — This you will be able to work out for 
yourself. First perform this simple experiment. Stir together 
a tablespoonful of stewed tomato and a tablespoonful of milk. 
What happens? Heat this mixture. What further do you 
notice ? How may you best extract the juice from the tomato ? 
You have noticed the effect of the acid tomato upon the 
milk. The soda is added to partly counteract this effect. 
Will you stir the soda into the tomato juice or into the milk? 
Will you stir the tomato juice into the milk, or the milk into 
the tomato juice? Will you cook the mixture at all? How 
long before serving will you mix the two? When will you 
add the butter and flour? 



Laboratory management. — An individual portion of soup n^ay be made 
with i cup of liquid, but it is better to allow 1 cup when possible to each 
pupil, or two pupils may work together. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 125 

The important point in this soup is to prevent the curdling, 
so you safeg^uard the milk at each step. 

Croutons may be served with any of these soups. 

12. Chili sauce. 

Ingredients. 

Tomatoes 12, medium sized and ripe 

Green pepper 1, finely chopped 

Vinegar 2 cups 

Sugar 3 tablespoonfuls 

Salt 1 tablespoonful 

Clove 2 teaspoonfuls 

Cinnamon 2 teaspoonfuls 

Allspice 2 teaspoonfuls 

Nutmeg 2 teaspoonfuls grated 

Method, — Peel tomatoes and slice into a preserving kettle. 
Add other ingredients and heat to the boiling point. Cook 
slowly two and one half hours. Pour into preserve jars and 
seal.

CHAPTER VIII 
CEREAL PRODUCTS 

The common grains^ sometimes called cereals,^ yield some 
of the most important of all the food materials. Those most 
widely used are wheat, maize, or Indian corn, oats, rice, 
barley, rye, and millet. In this country wheat and com are 
the two great crops upon which our prosperity largely de- 
pends, and a shortage in one of these crops is felt in the busi- 
ness world, not only in this country, but abroad. Rice is 
the important cereal in China, Japan, and India, and a 
failure of the rice crop may mean famine to millions of people, 
especially in India. These facts are mentioned to show that 
the race has learned to depend upon the grains as a staple 
food, and a study of their composition proves that this 
common habit is founded in reason. The grains are all 
members of the grass family, and the edible portion is the 
seed. From these seeds are manufactured pure starch, 
breakfast cereals, meal, and flour. Like beans and peas, 
these seeds are the storehouses of food for the young plants, 
and we therefore find the high nutritive value depicted in 
Fig. 37. Notice that the carbohydrate (starch) dontent is 
high in all ; that all contain protein, oats, wheat, and rye 
being about equal in this and higher than the others ; oats 
are highest in fat, com ranking next. The ash contains the 
same important mineral substances that we found in the 
fruits, the percentages of each differing somewhat with the 

» "Cereal" is derived from the Latin word *'cerealis,*' pertaining to Ceres, 
the Roman goddess of agriculture.

different grains and being quite different for the cereals as a 
class than for the fruits and vegetables as a class. It must 
be remembered that these percentages are given for the 
whole grain, and that the amoimts of the nutrients in the 
manufactured product depend upon the process employed. 

Manufacture of cereal food materials.^ — The primitive 
method of making the material in the grain available for use 
was by grinding the grain between two stones, or by pound- 
ing one stone upon another, and this method is used by the 
Mexicans and certain of the American Indians to this day, 
himaan muscle being the power employed. Wind and water 
were harnessed for grinding grain, and were the only motive 
powers available until the invention of steam, the grinding 
being done by stones. In a Connecticut town there still 
exists a mill stone, one of a pair so small that they were 
carried into the settlement on horseback, and when placed in 
a small mill by a brook, they ground a bushel of com in a day. 

Breakfast cereals and meal are now made in the great 
factories that produce flour ; steam is the motive power and 
the grains are broken, or rolled, between steel rollers. (See 
Chapter XII.) 

Breakfast cereals. — The ready-to-eat breakfast cereal 
has met the popular demand for a quickly prepared food for 
the first meal of the day. A few of these are made imder 
known conditions, but they are sometimes manufactured 
from inferior grain, and the presence of grit at times indi- 
cates a possible lack of cleanliness in the process. It is a 
question, too, whether or not the starch has been subjected 
to heat for a sufficient length of time, and whether they can 
be masticated sufficiently to make the grain digestible, 
and the nutritive material available. Their use for young 
children is undesirable. For older people, they add variety 

^ The manufacture of flour is discussed in the chapter on bread making. 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 129 

to the diet, but they are usually more expensive than the 
home-cooked breakfast foods, even when the cost of fuel is 
taken into account. See Fig. 38. 

Cooked breakfast cereals. — It is an easy task to cook a 
cereal, especially now that the fireless cooker in some form 
is present in so many homes. The cereal for breakfast does 
not necessitate early rising ; as it may be prepared the day or 
evening before and be served in palatable form in the morning. 

The most common breakfast cereals are made from oats, 
wheat, and com, varying in fineness of grain from those 
ground like a meal to the coarser cracked wheat and the 
samp made from com. It is well to use kinds made from 
different grains, but when the worth of a few has been proved, 
it is not wise to try another kind simply because it has a new 
label. One manufacturer confessed to a visitor that the 
same cereal was put into boxes of different colors and sold 
under different names as a means of inviting purchasers. 
The cereal foods made from whole grains are especially 
valuable on account of the high mineral content. 

It usually pays to buy in boxes, rather than in bulk, in 
the case of cereals; and always from a reliable grocer. If 
you purchase a box of cereal as a '* bargain," weigh its con- 
tents and compare the weight with the weight of a box 
bought in the regular way. Also examine such a box for 
the presence of insects. These may be reoognized some- 
times by a webby substance, and again the insects themselves 
may be detected. Do not buy too large a stock of cereals, 
since they are better when they are fresh from the factory, 
and a good firm renews its stock often. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. — 1. Softening of the fiber by long-con- 
tinued low temi)erature with a supply of water present. 



130 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



■i , i K i ^ 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 131 

2. Complete opening of the starch granules by the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

3. The protein present presents no special prqblem. Its diges- 
tibility is not especially affected, but the softening of the fiber of 
the cereal makes the protein available to us. 

Methods. — There are two classes into which the cereals may be 
divided, — the flaked and the granular. The weighing experi- 
ments (page 62) show that the granular is the heavier. This means 
that niore watei' \7ill be absorbed by a given measure of the granular, 
because it contains more material. 

In experimenting with a cereal at home it is well to try the 
proportion of water and cereal printed on the box the first time, 
altering the proportion if the first result is not satisfactory. There 
should be enough water to soften the cereal, and only just enough. 
If the cooked cereal is stiff, the measure of water is short; if so 
thin that the cereal runs on the plate, too much water was allowed. 

I. Preparation of breakfast cereal. 

Ingredients, 

1 part, by measure, flaked cereal to 2 of water. 

1 part granular cereal to 3 to 4 of water. 

1 cup of dry cereal will serve three or four people. 

Samp, eracked wheat, and coarse com meal will take from 

4 to 6 parts of water. 
Salt. A tablespoonful to a quart of water is an average 
amount. 

Utensils : a measuring cup ; a double boiler ; a fork. 

Method. — Measure the cereal and water, put the water into the 
inner part of the double boiler with the salt. Have the 
lower part of the boiler ready — about half full of hot water ; 
place the inner boiler directly upon the stove or over the flame. 
When the water is boiling rapidly, shake thecerealinto the water 
from a cup, so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. This 
is the first secret of a well-cooked cereal. The rapidly boiling 
water keeps the grains of cereal in motion, and thus they do 
not stick to the vessel nor to each other, and the heat reaches 
the starch in the grains equally. If the grains begin to settle, 
shake the vessel gently, but do not stir, even with a fork. 
Allow this process to continue for about five minutes, or until 
you see a thickening of the mass, so much so that the separate 



132 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

grains do not settle. If toward the end of this stage there is 
danger of sticking, lift the mass with the fork, but do not stir 
it, as this motion will break the grains. This first process 
opens the starch grains. Place the inner part of the boiler 
in the outer over boiling water and allow the cooking to con- 
tinue for at least one hour. For this is the second secret of the 
perfect cereal, — a long-continued process that softens the 
fiber and develops flavor. One cereal, advertised as being 
cooked in three minutes, remains unpalatable after that length 
of time, but is delicious at the end of two hours. If you have a 
fireless cooker, put the cereal in the double boiler into the 
cooker overnight for the second stage. Any low temperature 
apparatus gives the desired result. 

2. The uses of cold cereal. — Never throw away cooked cereals. 

The cold cereal is useful in many ways. 

(a) Mold in small cups with dates or other fruit, and serve 
with sugar and cream for luncheon. 

(b) Cool com meal mush in a flat dish, cut it in slices when 
cold, and brown the slices in a frying pan, with beef fat, or 
a butter substitute. Serve with sugar, molasses, or sirup for 
breakfast or luncheon. 

(c) Rice or hominy may be mixed with a beaten egg, molded 
into small cakes, and browned either in the frjdng pan, or 
in the oven. 

(d) A small remaining portion of any cereal may be used to 
thicken soup. 

(e) Any cooked cereal may be used in muffins or even yeast 
bread. (See those chapters.) 

3. Com meal "mush." — This is cooked by the same method as 

the other cereals, except that the amount of water is larger 
and the first boiling should continue longer. The meal must 
be scattered slowly into the boiling water, or else be mixed 
first with cold water, as it lumps very easily. The second stage 
of the process should continue several hours. 

Rice. — Rice varies very much in quality and in the shape 
of the grain. Louisiana and Chinese rice are among those 
that have a firm and large grain keeping its shape well when 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 133 

cooked. Inferior varieties become too soft, and the finished 
product is pasty and poor in color and flavor. Much is said 
at present about the harmful effect of the polishing process 
upon the quality of the. rice. An unpolished rice may some- 
times be found on the market, brownish in color and with a 
good flavor. 

4. Boiled rice. — Rice may be cooked in the double boiler by the 
same method as other cereals, allowing 1 part of rice to 3 of 
water. The rice should be well washed in cold water. 

The second stage need not be continued so long, from three 
quarters of an hour to an hour being sufficient. The flavor is 
improved by the use of milk in place of half of the water. By 
this method the nutritive value is much increased. 

Another method used by the Chinese continues the boiling 
throughout the whole process. A very large amount of water 
is used, several quarts for one cup of rice, and when the water 
is boiling violently the rice is scattered in very slowly. The 
boiling continues from twenty minutes to half an hour, or until 
the grains are tender, and then the water is drained off, through 
a colander. The rice in the colander should then be placed 
where the remaining moisture will steam off. By this method 
nutrients are lost, but the grains of the rice stand out dis- 
tinctly and are light and dry. It is a difficult method for the 
novice, because its success depends upon the removal of the 
rice from the water just at the moment it is tender, but not too 
soft. The grains should be tested in twenty minutes. 

Com products, — Com being oiu* most abundant grain, it 
is the cheapest, and we should promote its use. Hominy 
and samp and Indian meal, when well cooked, are all most 
palatable. There is a difference between old and new pro- 
cess com meal, to be noticed in the flavor and in the behavior 
of the two kinds in cooking. The new process meal now more 
largely on the market has been deprived of the germ, which 
contains a large amount of oil, and although the meal does 
not deteriorate so soon, there is some loss of flavor. More- 



134 - FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over, when the new process meal is used in an old-time 
recipe, more wetting must be used than the recipe calls for 
and a larger amount of fat. 

The old process of grinding between stones is still employed 
in some localities. Southern and Rhode Island com meal 
are ground in this way, and may be found at some groceries. 
There are also two colors, the yellow and the white, each with 
a distinctive flavor, and some people who think they dislike 
com meal find the white meal agreeable. 

Pure starches. — These occur as food materials in several 
forms. Cornstarch is the starchy portion only removed 
from the grain of com. Wheat starch is more largely used 
for laimdry purposes than for food. Rice flour may be 
treated as starch in cooking. Arrowroot is a fine starch 
from the roots of a family of plants growing in the West 
Indies and other warm climates. It is used principally in 
cooking for invalids. Cassava, manioca, tapioca, and sago 
are starchy materials in granular form. The first three are 
made from the pith of the cassava plant, the sago from the 
sago palm. The pure starches are all easily digested and 
inexpensive. Com starch is the most abimdant and cheap- 
est piu'e starch in this country. 

The starch granule. — To understand the behavior of 
materials Uke cornstarch, rice flour, and arrowroot in cook- 
ing, we need to know more of the starch grain. Cornstarch 
is composed of myriads of tiny granules somewhat Uke those 
pictiu-ed in Fig. 39, but smaller. The starch granules of dif- 
ferent plants differ in size and even in shape, but they all 
have a covering lying in folds, the piu'e starch being within. 
The granule unfolds or bursts when exposed to heat. When 
these granules are floating in water, and, being heated, open 
at the same moment, the starch paste is smooth ; otherwise, 
the starch lumps.

proportion is used. It may be made very palatable, and is 
too valuable in cooking and too inexpensive to be discarded.

Milk 1 pint 

Comstai*ch 3 tablespoonfuls, level 

Cocoa (Baker's) 3 tablespoonfuls, levd 

Sugar i oup 

Salt i teaspoonful

What utensils? You should be able to plan the method of 
mixing. The milk must be heated in a double boiler. Which 
method of mixing in the cornstarch will you use ? How can 
you best add the cocoa, sugar, and salt ? The vanilla ? 

It is difficult to boil milk directly over the fire or flame, 
without scorching it. Since the starch cannot well be exposed 
to the boiling temperature in this case, the process must con- 
tinue in the double boiler until the mixture has thickened well, 
for at least half an hour, three quarters being better. When 
the cooking is finished, pour the mixture into molds which have 
been wet in cold water. When the mixture is cooled, chill it 
in the refrigerator. Serve with cream or milk and sugar for 
those who may want it sweeter. This gives a soft mold, that 
is much more palatable than one so stiff that it has a firm shape. 
This will serve four or five people. 

6. Tapioca and sago. — These materials make delicious desserts 

with fruit. They are also used with eggs and milk. (See 
Chapter XV.) 

Macaronij spaghetti, and vermicelli are valuable cereal 
products made from flour, this form of cereal food having 
originated in Italy. The Italians manufacture the paste in 
a large variety of forms, and some of the small fancy shapes 
are also used in soup. The composition of macaroni is shown 
in Fig. 51. It is a valuable material, and when served or 
cooked with cheese may well be the main dish of a home 
luncheon. 



Laboraiory management. — The undivided portion of cereal may be J cup. 
Cornstarch may be made with J cup of liquid.

Ingredients. 

Maoaroni } oup, broken in inch pieces 

Boiling water 2 quarts 

Salt 1 tablespoonful 

Cream } cup 

Method, — Cook macaroni in boiling salted water twenty 
minutes or until soft, drain in a strainer, pour cold water over 
it to remove stickiness. Add cream and reheat. A thin 
white sauce may be used in place of the cream. 

8. Macaroni baked with cheese. — Cover the bottom of a baking 

dish with plain boiled macaroni. Sprinkle with grated 
cheese. Add another layer of macaroni and another of cheese. 
Repeat until the dish is full. Pour a thin sauce over this, 
almost filling the dish. Cover with buttered crumbs and 
bake in hot oven until crumbs are brown. Some prefer to 
omit the crumbs and have a thick layer of the cheese on top 
which becomes crisp and brown. Boiled macaroni and spa- 
ghetti may be served with tomato sauce and a little grated cheese 
This is called t* Italian style."

CHAPTER IX 
EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 

Eoos are a specially interesting food because they contain 
all the elements necessary to the development of the young 
chick within the shell. The structure of the egg is famiUar, 
with its division into the yolk and white, and it is interesting 
to note the details of this structure. 

Break a fresh egg carefully into a saucer. The shell is 
porous, allowing water to evaporate from the egg and air 
to enter. To this porosity is due the fact that other sub- 
stances may enter the egg, giving it an unnatural flavor and 
even hastening its deterioration. Within the shell is a fine 
membrane which protects the white. The yolk is also di- 
vided from the white by a more delicate membrane which 
enables one to separate the yolk from the white of a fresh 
egg. A careful examination reveals at each end of the yolk 
a continuation of this membrane in the form of small cords 
which are fastened at each end of the shell, holding the yolk 
evenly suspended in the center of the shell. Rough handling 
or jolting breaks this membrane, and the yolk drops to one 
side. 

Lift the white carefully with a fork, and notice its elas- 
ticity. This cohesive property makes it possible to beat air 
into the white until the whole mass become porous. The 
yolk is creamy rather than light when beaten, and a bit of 
the yolk mixed with the white prevents the latter from be- 
coming light and dry.

Fio. 40. — Composition of egua and cheese. 



140 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Composition of the egg. — Figure 40 gives the composition 
of the yolk and white taken together, and of the yolk and 
white separated. The protein content is high, and the fat 
content as well, the yolk containing a higher percentage of 
these two foodstuffs than the white. The mineral matter is 
of high value, iron and phosphorus being foimd in ideal 
forms in the yolk. In using the egg as food we are availing 
ourselves of one of nature's richest storehouses. A single 
egg of average size yields about 75 calories, of which 60 come 
from the yolk and 15 from the white. A very large egg, 
weighing two and two thirds ounces, will yield 100 calories. 

Fresh eggs and cold storage eggs. — The fresh-laid egg is 
always desired for its delicious flavor, and this flavor changes 
but little in a week or two if the egg is kept cool. It is de- 
sirable to preserve eggs, however, for future use at the season 
when they are most abundant and cheap. Many methods 
have been tried, such as laying them away in sawdust, sink- 
ing them in water-glass solution, or coating the shell with 
paraflBji or some other substance to prevent evaporation and 
the entrance of air. The introduction of cold storage on a 
large scale promises a solution of the problem. If eggs are 
fresh when placed in storage, it is possible to keep them 
just above the freezing temperature for months without 
appreciable deterioration. 

Eggs too long in storage may be detected by the musty 
odor and flavor, the rimning of the yolk into the white, and 
the thin quality of the white which prevents beating stiff. 
Some states have already passed stringent laws in regard to 
the sale of cold storage eggs. 

The cost of eggs and how to buy. — The demand for fresh 
eggs is great, and so many eggs are exported, that the price is 
high, even in the summer. Twenty-five cents a dozen is a 
reasonable price, but this is below the average at the present 



. EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 141 

date. The thirty-five or forty-cent daily allowance for food 
will permit the moderate use of eggs at thirty-five cents a 
dozen, but not a liberal use in cakes and desserts. They 
should be used at such a price and with that allowance as 
the main dish for breakfast or luncheon at times, and not 
in sweet dishes calling for three or four eggs. If a recipe 
for soft custard calls for three eggs to a pint of milk, leave 
out one egg or even two, and use one or two tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch instead. Select eggs with a hard shell, and 
yolk of rich yellow. If the shell is soft and the yolk pale, 
these deficiences should be reported, as they can be corrected 
by the poultryman. The difference in color of the shells, 
whether white or brown, is not of great consequence. If you 
can buy eggs by the crate direct from the poultryman, this 
is a saving, provided the eggs can be used before they de- 
teriorate. A small crate holds fifteen dozen ; the usual size 
thirty dozen. Some express companies have a special rate 
for eggs, and parcel post should aid in this method of buying. 
Relative digestibility of soft and hard cooked eggs. — The 
fact must be recalled that to digest is to dissolve, and that 
the digestion of food means a dissolving by the digestive 
juices, aided by water. When we speak of the digestibility 
of food we may mean the ease and comfort of digestion, or 
the length of time taken by the process, or the completeness 
of the process. If we take the third of these meanings, hard- 
cooked egg is as digestible as the soft-cooked or the raw egg, 
because it is completely dissolved in digestion in the course 
of time. If the second meaning of digestion is taken, the 
hard-cooked egg may be slightly less digestible, for a slightly 
longer time is consumed in the process. The latest researches, 
however, show that the digestive process is longer with any 
food than was formerly supposed, and the difference in this 
case is not especially important. Indeed, we must accept 



142 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the conclusions of the scientist and frankly admit that the 
differences of temperature in cooking of egg do not have any- 
great effect upon its digestibility. 

Why then the popular idea that a hard-boiled egg is " ab- 
solutely indigestible " ? A hard boiled egg, or more than one, 
eaten rapidly, without mastication, at a picnic, and with 
much sweet food at an unusual hour, may interfere with the 
" ease and comfort in digestion " resulting from such a meal. 
But if the \ whites of the hard-boiled eggs are chopped fine, 
the yolk mashed, and the two served upon toast, thus insur- 
ing mastication, a dish is produced that is of average diges- 
tibility and that may be used for breakfast or luncheon with- 
out hesitation. 

If a tender, jellylike consistency is wanted, cook the egg 
below the boiling point of water. If, however, a firmer egg 
is preferred, use the old time method, and cook the egg three 
or four minutes in boiling water. It is the easier and quicker 
method. 

Moreover, do not hesitate to use an egg " boiled " half an 
hour, provided it is chopped fine or sliced. 

I 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

1. Eggs used raw. — An egg, swallowed whole, followed by a cracker, 

is a ** quick lunch " that is not harmful, and it is sometimes 
convenient to be able to take an egg in this way. A sprinkling 
of salt upon it makes it more agreeable. 

2. Beaten eggs. — Beat the yolk and white separately. Add to 

the yolk a teaspoonful of sugar, a shake of salt, some flavor- 
ing, and f of a cup of milk. Beat the white gently into this 
mixture and serve in a glass. The flavoring may be a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of vanilla, or a tablespoonful of orange juice. 
This is sometimes served to an invalid who can take milk, and 
is an agreeable luncheon for any one. If milk does not agree 
with one, a larger amount of fruit juice may be used with the 
addition of some water, possibly carbonated. The "whito 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 143 

alone is g^iven in cases of severe illness, mixed with a small 

amount of water, and fruit juice if the physician permits the 

latter. This is sometimes the only food that can be retained 

by an invalid. 

Principles of egg cookery. — Protein in the form of an egg-albumin 

is the foodstuff to consider in the cooking of eggs. Heat produces 

in the egg a change in color and in texture or firmness, the firmness 

or hardness depending upon the degree of heat and the length of 

time given to the cooking. Coagulation is the term used for this 

change in the egg-albumin. 

1. The white of egg begins to coagulate and to show an opaque 
white at about 180** F. 

2. A temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water 
for about ten minutes will give the white a jellylike, tender con- 
sistency, and slightly cook the yolk. Continued for an hour, the 
white becomes solid and adheres to the shell. 

3. The boiling point of water gives a firmer consistency than a 
temperature below this point. The white is free from the shell. 

4. A high temperature, that of a hot pan, will produce a leathery 
consistency if long continued. 

A. An experiment with the egg. 

Apparatus and materials. — A ring stand, wire net, Bunsen burner, 
glass beaker, test tube, chemical thermometer, white of egg. 

Method. — Put the beaker two thirds full of water on the wire 
net over the flame. Put enough white of egg into the test tube to 
cover the bulb of the thermometer when this is put into the tube. 
Clamp the test tube so that it rests in the water in the beaker. 
The surface of the water should stand above the top of the white of 
egg. Clamp the thermometer so that it is held in the white of egg 
in the test tube. The white should be stirred with a fork before 
it is put into the test tube, and only a small quantity used. 

Note : 1. The temp«»ture when the first visible change occurs. 

2. The temperature when the whole mass becomes of a 

jeUylike consistency. 

3. The temperature when the water reaches the boiling 

point. Remove ; note the consistency. 

3. Jellied or coddled eggs. — See that the shells are whole and clean. 
If the eggs are just taken from the refrigerator, lay them in 



144 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

warm water a few minutes. Make ready a double boiler, the 
lower part half full of boiling water. Put the required number 
of eggs into the inner boiler, cover with water that has just 
stopped boiling, put on the boiler cover, and stand the boiler 
where the water below will no longer boil. The eggs will be 
done in from six to eight minutes. 

Having performed the preceding experiment, you should be 
able to invent another way of accomplishing this result. 

4. Boiled eggs. — Put one egg at a time from a tablespoon in- 

to boiling water. Allow the water to boil for three or four 
minutes, depending upon the preference of those served. 
Remove the eggs, and serve at once. 

The hard-boiled egg should remain in the boiling water half 
an hour. 

Bearing in 'mind the fact that hard-boiled eggs must be 
chopped or sliced, cannot you invent a way of using them in a 
luncheon dish? 

5. Poached eggs. — Make ready a frying pan by setting muffin 

rings in it, and filling it about half full of gently simmering 
water, with a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Break the 
eggs one at a time into a saucer, and slip each egg carefully into 
a muffin ring. See that the pan stands where the water is just 
below the boiUng point, for rapidly bubbling water breaks the 
eggs. When the white begins to set, pour the hot water 
gently over the tops of the eggs from a spoon. Cook until the 
white is firm. Slip a griddle cake turner under the egg^ lift 
it gently, and place it upon a piece of buttered toast which 
you have ready on a hot plate, or platter, and remove the ring. 
An easier method resembling the poached egg is to break 
the egg raw into a small buttered cup or ** patty," standing the 
cups in a pan of water just below the boihng point, the pan 
being on the top of the stove or in the oven. Each egg should 
have a sprinkling of salt, and may have a bit of butter, and a 
shake of pepper. Cover the pan. This process is longer than 
the other, and the eggs must be watched to see when the 
process is complete. 

6. Scrambled eggs. — As the name denotes, this is a process needing 

a quick motion. Allow an egg to each person. Have ready 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 145 

a fr3dng pan heated, a broad bladed knife, and a tablespoonful 
of butter, or butter substitute, ready to melt in the pan. 

(1) Melt the butter, break the eggs into the pan, without 
beating them, and begin to scrape them from the bottom of 
the pan with the knife, as fast as you can move your hand. 
This is an old-time method, and gives s, mixture of white and 
yellow color. Stop the process when the eggs are softer than 
you wish them for serving, as they will stiffen after they are 
removed from the fire. Sprinkle in salt, before you give 
the last scramble, and serve at once. 

(2) Beat the eggs, adding a tablespoonful of water for each 
egg, and a shake of salt for each, and proceed as in (1). 

7. The omelet. — The novice should see an omelet made, as there 
is a " knack/* in the motion not to be conveyed by words. 
The omelet is a French dish, and is made to perfection by the 
French cook. A perfect oijaelet is rolled or folded over, and is 
creamy within and a golden brown without. " Omelet pans " 
are made for the purpose, but a small frsdng pan may be used. 
The pan should be perfectly smooth. Do not attempt to 
make an omelet with more than two eggs until you become 
exi)ert. This is one method, and others are used by different 
French cooks. The first stage makes the whole mass creamy, 
the second browns one surface. 

(1) Have the pan warm enough to melt two teaspoonfuls of 
butter, but not hot. Beat two eggs with a fork until they are 
creamy but not foamy, and add two teaspoonfuls of water, 
with two shakes of salt. 

Put the mixture into the pan, standing the pan where it 
has a medium heat. If over gas, the flame should be low, and 
covered with asbestos. Proceed as with the scrambled egg, 
with great rapidity, and when the mass is creamy, lift the pan, 
tip it slightly, and push the whole mass toward the handle end 
of the pan. Put two teaspoonfuls more of butter in the pan,, 
and set it where the heat is intense. Smooth the mass of egg 
over the whole surface of the pan that the omelet may become 
brown underneath. Shake the pan gently back and forth, lift 
the omelet at the edge with a knife to see if the browning is 
accomplished, take the p8.n from the fire, fold or roll the omelet 
from the handle end of the pan to the front, and turn it out 
upon a hot plate. 

L 



146 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A method easier for the novioe is to aooomplish the first 
stage in a bowl set into a teakettle, beating into the mass as 
it thickens a teaspoonfui of butter, or a tabiespoonful of 
cream. When the mixture is evenly creamy, turn it into the 
hot buttered pan and proceed as with (1). 

(2) Light omdeL — This is not a true omelet, but in reality 
a souffl6 cooked in a trying pan. It is somewhat insipid in 
flavor and is not easier to make weU than the French omelet. 
As commonly served it is apt to be underdone or tough. 

With the light omelet, the eggs and whites are separated and 
the whites beaten until light and dry. Beat the yolks until 
creamy, adding water and salt as in (1). Pour this mixture 
over the white, and cut and fold the mass. See page 63. 
Pour this into a buttered baking dish and set in a moderate 
oven. The oven should not be more than 300® F. Serve in 
the pan. 

When gas is used, the souffle may be set in the oven with 
the flame low, and browned for a moment under the flame 
turned high. 

Both of these omelets may be varied by the addition of 
chopped parsley or chopped ham, or grated cheese. 



Laboratory management. When the price of eggs is high, some of the 
experiments can be demonstrated by the teacher. Eggs should be used 
when the price is at its lowest, even if this interferes with the logictd se- 
quence of lessons. 

Milk and Milk Products 

Milk is the natural food of the young mammal, and con- 
tains all the foodstuffs in a form easily assimilable. Starch 
is not present, the carbohydrate being found in the form of 
lactose, or milk sugar, a sugar dififering somewhat from the 
sugars found in vegetables and fruit (see Chapter X). 

Whole milk and the milk products, cream, butter, and 
cheese, are all important food materials among the nations 
of the western world ; and the manufacture of milk products, 
such as condensed milk, butter, and cheese, has developed 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 147 

large industries. While the Chinese and Japanese are two 
great peoples who have not utilized milk or any of its prod- 
ucts as food for grown people to any extent, yet we are fully 
justified in counting these foods among the necessities. 
Nothing can fully take the place of milk in the family dietary. 
Figure 41 shows how all the foodstuffs are represented in 
milk. When milk first comes from the cow the fat is sus- 
pended in tiny, invisible particles throughout the water, 
giving the milk its yellow tint, and the fat rises to the top 
in the form of cream after a few hours. The protein, sugar, 
and ash are dissolved in the water. When milk reaches the 
stomach, the protein separates from the water in the form of 
curd. This change is brought about by an enzyme (soluble 
ferment) called rennin, which is present, along with pepsin, 
in the gastric juice. Curd is also formed by the souring of 
milk through the action of bacteria, or by adding acid di- 
rectly to the milk. Milk should never be gulped down, but 
taken in sips, so that only small portions of curd are formed 
in the stomach, because these are much easier to digest than 
large ones. Sometimes milk is soured purposely, as in butter- 
milk or zoolak or matzoon, that curds may form and be 
beaten fine before it is drunk. This is very easy to digest, 
because then no large curds can form. For the same reason, 
it is often better to take milk with bread or some other food, 
or to cook it in some dish. Skim milk is a valuable food, for 
it has everything foimd in whole milk but the fat. We miss 
the flavor of the fat in drinking it, hence it is better to use it 
in pudding or soup or in cooking cereals where we do not care 
so much about the milk flavor. Study Fig. 41, comparing 
the percentages of the foodstuffs in whole, skim, and butter- 
milk, and cream. Notice that the skim milk is higher than 
the whole milk in protein and sugar, that it has as much ash, 
and a trace of fat even. It does not tell us, however, that

how closely the country and the city are united, A case of 
typhoid fever in one farm family, not properly cared for, may 
be the seed of a serious epidemic in some town. To insure 
clean milk to the consumer, and a fair return in money to the 
producer, is a great sanitary and commercial problem, not 
to be solved in a day. 

Milk is a medium in which bacteria flourish, both the harm- 
less and the disease producing. Typhoid fever and other 
fatal diseases may be carried by milk from unclean bams

and dairies, and tuberculoBis is possible from diseased cows. 
The cows must be in good health, and the stable clean. 
Figure 43 shows a stable with cement floor and good drainage. 
The cows must themselves be' clean, and should be ciuried 



FiQ. 43. — A modem cow house. 

and washed. The milkers should have clean clothes and 
hands, and all receptacles should be sterilized. The milk 
must be rapidly cooled (see Fig, 44), bottled in sterilized 
bottles, kept cool during transportation, and delivered as 
promptly as possible to the consumer. " Certified " milk 
is produced and handled under the best conditions, but costs 
at least 15 cents a quart. Since a quart of milk is equiv- 
alent to a pound of steak or to 8 eggs, milk even at 15 to 
20 cents a quart b more economical than meat and eggs at 
ordinary prices. At the usual price of 8 to 10 cents a 
quart, milk is very economical as compared with other per- 
ishable foods. 

The question of preservation and pasteurization can be 
treated here but briefly. Preservatives are forbidden by 
law in most states. Pasteurization is heating at a tempera- 



EGGS. MILK, AND CHEESE 151 

ture sufficiently high to kill any disease germs present, but 
not high enough to give a cooked taste. This process, while 
it destroys most of the bacteria, does not kill the spores of all. 
The chief arguments against pasteurization are (1) that on a 
commercial scale it is difficult to really accomplish this, and 
(2) that it is easily used to cover the sale of unclean milk. 
The argument for it is, that it is impossible to obtain as yet 



Fio. 44. — Milk botUJDK room. 

an ideal supply for a large city in hot weather, and that 
pasteurization, if properly conducted, kills nearly all of the 
dangerous bacteria and saves the lives of many babies. 
Clean milk that needs no pasteurization is our ultimate 
^m, and we must remember that milk pasteurized under 
unknown conditions needs to be kept cold and treated with 
even more care than fresh milk, for it " spoils " quite as easily, 
only we may not know it because it may not taste sour. 
In the last few years the question of pasteurization has 



152 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

been studied with very great care. It is found best to heat 
the milk for 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 140° to 
155** F. If it is certain that this method has been used, one 
need not hesitate to trust the milk, for the arguments against 
pasteurization do not properly apply here. 

How to buy. — Investigate by question and inspection, if 
possible, the available milk supply. Be sure to do this in the 
country in the summer. Always buy bottled milk. ' Where 
the income is small, good quality milk should be used for the 
little children and invalids, and skim milk purchased for 
cooking. In many places skim milk is supplied in bottles 
by reliable firms. The usual price for bottled milk in the 
city is 8 to 10 cents, and this is of good average quality. 
Keep milk cold. If there is no ice, use an ice substitute 
(page 74), and in very hot weather pasteurize or scald the 
milk, cooling afterward as quickly as possible by placing in 
cold water and stirring the water. 

GENERAL METHODS AND R£Cn>ES 

Principles of cookery. — Clean, sweet milk is an ideal food, which 
requires no cooking. Heating milk to 212° F. changes its proper- 
ties in some way, so that it is not considered an ideal food for 
babies' regular diet. If it must be used, for reasons of safety, 
some uncooked food, such as orange juice, should also be given. 
This is the reason for pasteurizing milk instead of boiling it. 

Heating milk in an open vessel causes some of the protein to 
harden into a thin " skin " on the top. This can be prevented 
by stirring the milk until it is cool. 

I. To pasteurize milk. — This cannot be done accurately without 
a thermometer. The milk bottle should be placed upon a 
rack in a kettle of water, with a clean thermometer inserted 
through the cover of the bottle. Heat the water slowly, 
and watch the thermometer. When it reaches 155® F., see that 
the water becomes no hotter. Set the kettle on a rack on 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 153 

the stove top, or use a simmering burner with rack and as- 
bestos mat. It is difficult to keep the temperature even, but 
it should remain at 140-155'' F. half an hour. At the end of 
half an hour, the bottle should be removed, and cooled as 
rapidly as possible in running cold water. 

2. Rennet custard. — 1 quart milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 

a shake of salt, flavoring, 1 rennet tablet. The flavoring 
may be: 1 teaspoonful vanilla, or a few tablespoonfuls of 
orange juice, or the vanilla, plus three or four tablespoonfuls of 
cocoa to suit the taste. 

To prepare. — This is a process without cooking. Rennet 
tablets are made from the stomach of the calf, and contain the 
digestive enzyme, rennin, which results in the solidifying of the 
curd of the milk. Rennet custard has passed the flrst stage of 
milk digestion. 

Put all the flavoring substances into the milk, and warm it 
slightly, not more than 100° F. The cocoa when used should 
be " dissolved " in a small amount of hot water. Dissolve 
the rennet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and stir this very 
thoroughly into the milk. Pour the milk into the cups in which 
the custard will be served, and set the cups in a warm but not 
hot place. A good method is to place them in a pan of warm 
water (100® F.). The milk becomes firm in a half hour or an 
hour, and as soon as it is set, should be put in the ice box, other- 
wise the process continues and the custard becomes watery 
as the curd shrinks and forces out the whey. Serve very cold 
with fruit on the top, or whipped cream with the cocoa flavoring ; 
or put grated nutmeg or powdered cinnamon on the top. 
This is a simple and delicious dessert, and one of the most whole- 
some. For children it should be flavored with fruit juice or 
vanilla rather than with cocoa. 

3. Uses of sour milk. — Do not throw away any sour milk that is 

clean and not stale. Milk that has soured enough to set, is a 
delicious dessert, with cream and sugar. The acid is very pleas- 
ant, being the same as that of buttermilk. Sour milk is better for 
griddlecakes and muffins than sweet milk. (See Chapter XI.) 
Another excellent use for sour milk is to make it into cottage 
cheese. (See below.) 



154 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Matzoon and other similar preparations are essentially 
soured milks, prepared under controlled conditions. These 
preparations are the common form of milk in certain parts 
of the Orient, where milk is never used sweet. 

Kumyss is milk slightly soured and fermented with one 
species of yeast. This is a Russian method. These prep- 
arations are excellent for invalids and exhausted people, 
for they can sometimes be assimilated because of the fine 
curds when sweet milk cannot. 

Condensed milk is a practical method of preserving milk. 
The milk is evaporated under pressure at a high temperature 
in apparatus constructed for the purpose. Cane sugar or 
glucose is sometimes added. A new patent process con- 
denses the milk at low temperature, preserving it for a short 
period, as compared with the condensed milk in tins, but it 
keeps well for several days, and bears transportation. Con- 
densed milk may be used in cooking, when clean fresh milk 
is not available. The unsweetened kinds are most useful, 
but, like pasteurized milk, must be treated with care after 
the cans are opened. 

Cheese. — Cheese is made from the curd of milk, and con- 
tains the most nutritive parts of the milk in highly con- 
centrated form. In the process of manufacture, the milk 
is first curdled by rennet, and the whey strained out. The 
curds after preliminary treatment, varying according to the 
style of cheese to be made, are finally pressed together very 
slowly in a cheese press, which is screwed down more tightly 
as the cheese becomes dryer. The cheeses are then covered 
with cheesecloth and " ripened " slowly, the ripening process 
giving characteristic consistency and flavor. This ripening 
is due to the action of bacteria and molds. (See page 97.) 
Foreign varieties of cheese, made originally in some one lo- 
cality, have marked colors, quality, and flavors, as Brie, 



EOas, MILK. AND CHEESE 

Camembert, Roquefort, and 
the Swiss cheeses. . Parmesan 
is an Italian cheese, excellent 
with macaroni and spaghetti. 
' American cheeses vary in 
color, in strength of flavor, 
in creaminess, and in d^ree 
of hardness. Much the 
greater part is, however, of 
the general type known as 
"American cheddar" or 
"standard factory" cheese. 

Clvb cheese is an American 
cheese of good quality, put 
up in small jars. It is a soft 
cheese, excellent to serve with 
crackers, but is too expensive 
for common use. 

Cottage cheese is a home 
product made from sour milk, 
and used at once. 

Composition and nutritive ^ J 

value. — Cheese is high in ^ g 

protem, and usually in fat. g 

(See Fig. 40.) Note the small I 

amount of water, which * 

makes cheese a very concen- 
trated food. The protein 
content makes it a meat sub- 
stitute, for those with whom 
cheese does not disagree.

centrated form of food, it

should be eaten in small quantities, and in combination with 
other food materials in such a way that it will become finely 
divided, or it will not be easily digested. The ash content 
is high, the most valuable of the ash constituents of the milk 
being retained in the cheese. 

The cost of cheese. — .The foreign cheeses are expensive, 
but American cheeses may be classed among the moderate 
priced foods and they compare favorably with other protein 
foods. 

Cheese costs more than beans, and less than most cuts 
of meat. A good American cheese costs about twenty-five 
cents per pound. Taking accoimt of composition as well as 
cost per pound, we find that a given amount of money buys 
about twice as much food value when spent for cheese as it 
would if spent for beef. See Fig. 45. 

Care of cheese in the pantry. — Cheese should be kept dry 
and covered, that its odor may not be noticeable. Soft 
cheese should be kept in the ice box. The receptacle for 
cheese should be thoroughly sterilized before each uew pur- 
chase is put away. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

z. Uncooked cheese. — Serve a cream cheese with a salad of let- 
tuce, and the imported cheeses with crackers and fruit for 
dessert. American cheese may be thinly sliced and used in 
sandwiches. A small piece of cheese with apple pie or pudding 
is an old-fashioned combination that is always agreeable, but 
sometimes difficult of digestion. 

2. Cottage cheese. — Use sour milk that has set. Other ingre- 
dients: salt to taste, cayenne pepper or paprika, if liked. 
Quality and flavor are improved by the addition of a table- 
spoonful of butter or two tablespoonfuls of cream to a pint of 
the curd, but these are not necessary. 

Warm the milk slowly, until the whey begins to separate 
from the curd. If this process is continued too long, and the 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 157 

milk becomes hot, the curd will be tough. Place a piece of 
cheesecloth over a bowl, pour in the curds and whey, and lift 
the cloth carefully, allowing the whey to run through. Squeeze 
out the remaining whey. Add the seasoning and other ingre- 
dients to the curd, shape in balls, and chill before serving. It 
is delicious served with lettuce and dressing as a salad, or with 
gingerbread for dessert at luncheon or supper. 
Principles of cooking cheese. — The fat in the cheese is melted by 
heat. The protein is toughened by a high temperature, there- 
fore a low temperature process should be used. 

3. Cheese cooked with other food materials. — A creamy cheese 

should be selected for cooking. Cheese may be grated and 
sprinkled on the top of potato on the half shell, or any 
other mashed potato ; or it may be sliced and placed with each 
layer in escalloped potato. Its use is common with macaroni ; 
and a dish of macaroni with milk and cheese is a good meat 
substitute, and may be used as the main dish of a luncheon or 
simple dinner. Those to whom cheese is agreeable will find 
many places for its use. Its flavor harmonizes with celery and 
with tomato. The Italians serve grated Parmesan cheese with 
soup, and with spaghetti that has a tomato sauce. 

4. Cheese crackers. — Select crackers of a firm quality that will 

not crumble or flake easily, and of a small size. Spread very 
thinly with soft butter, put the crackers in a pan, and 
sprinkle grated cheese upon each one. Set the pan in a mod- 
erate oven until the cheese is melted. A sprinkling of paprika 
may be used. Serve with lettuce, celery, or other green salad.

CHAPTER X 
THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 

Fats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but 
have much more carbon than the other kinds of foodstuffs. 
Notice in Fig. 46 that olive oil and lard are pure fats 
the other fat foods containing water, protein, and ash. Fat 
is available in various forms, with differing flavors and a 
wide range of prices. To many people it is unpalatable in 
some of its cheapest f onns ; yet itsWeis important, and some 
kind should be included in the diet. Fluid and emulsified 
fats are the most easily digested, hence olive oil, cream, and 
egg yolk are highly desirable. Bacon and butter belong 
nearly in the same class. A vigorous man at hard labor can 
digest fat of any kind without difficulty, and needs it because 
it gives so much fuel in proportion to its bulk. 

Fat tends to retard gastric digestion, and delicate persons 
must be careful about taking with it other foods which are 
hard to digest, or taking it in the form of fried foods, pastries, 
rich cakes, and sauces. Persons with delicate appetite, 
who lose weight because they do not get enough fuel, may be 
benefited by taking a little more fat in the diet, especially 
if they do not digest starch and sugar readily, but a very 
large amount (over 6 or 7 ounces a day) will not be perfectly 
digested. 

Fat as a food. — Beef fat^ as it occurs with lean, is a digestible fat. 
If thoroughly browned in the cooking process, it is most pala- 
table, and the taste for it should be cultivated. In gravy, it may 
be used with potato, instead of butter. Fat tried out from suet, may

be used in place of butter as an ingredient in some puddings, and 
even in batter mixtures. It may also be used with vegetables when 
the price of butter is prohibitive. See Fig. 47. 

Bacon is a digestible and agreeable form of fat, but it is not so 
cheap as beef fat, though cheaper than butter. 

Fat pork is lower in price than bacon, and can be assimilated by 
vigorous people, especially those living out of doors. 

Cream is one of the most delicious fatty food materials, and is 
digestible, but ranks with butter and bacon as to. cost. While it 
is not a cheap food, it is not such an extravagance when moderately 
used as some people suppose, who have not worked out the problem. 
Usually the most economical source of cream is to take it from 
the top of the bottle of milk. The remaining partially skimmed 
milk may be used at table or in cooking or for making cottage 
cheese. 

Butter is a digestible fat, ranking at present among the more 
expensive food materials. 

Watchfulness is necessary with both cream and milk that clean- 
liness and quality may be insured. 

Butter substitutes, — These are made from beef fat and other 
edible fats and oils, and are much less expensive than butter. They 
may be used in cooking with good result. The usual trade names 
are butterine, or oleomargarine, or some word similar to these. 
Oleomargarine has the same food value as butter at lower cost, but 
lacks fine flavor. 

Olive or sweet oil. — The fat content of olive oil is one hundred 
per cent, its fuel value being equal to that of lard. See Fig. 46. 
It is made in Italy, France, Spain, and California, the oils from 
the different countries differing somewhat in flavor. The cheaper 
grades are sometimes adulterated with corn oil or cottonseed oil, 
which have the same food value but should, of course, be sold under 
their own names and not at olive oil prices. An American firm is 
now manufacturing olive oil in Spain ; this and the California 
olive oil are of high grade. Italian oil by the gallon is of good 
quality, and usually somewhat less expensive than the French. 
It is a costly food material, but valuable in the dietary. Never 
buy it in small bottles, as this adds greatly to the cost. The most 
economical method is to purchase by the gallon in a tin can. If 
kept cool, it will not deteriorate except very slowly. Always wipe 
off the mouth of the bottle or can before pouring out the oil. 

M 



162 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Fat as a cooking medium. — Fat is necessary for the saut£, 
and for deep fat frying. For deep fat frying several prep- 
arations are made from cottonseed oil that are agreeable 
to use and of moderate price. 

Lard has been the most commonly used, but many people object 
to the flavor. Beef drippings should be saved and kept cool in 
covered jelly glasses. These drippings are useful for browning 
vegetables, meatballs, and in pan-broiling if a small amount of 
additional fat is necessary. 

When deep fat frying is used, great pains must be taken to 
see that the fat is sufficiently hot in order that the food ma- 
terial may not soak fat, and the cooked food must be kept 
hot when the fat is draining off on absorptive paper. The 
best fats for this purpose are the vegetable oils. The re- 
fined cottonseed oils now on the market are excellent. For 
details of use see page 120. Keep a box of sand to pour into 
it, if the kettle of fat takes fire. Never pour water into 
blazing fat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND Rl^CIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

Fat melts at a low temperature. 

At about 350** F. it begins to smoke. 

At a higher temperature, a chemical change takes place, and the 
fat finally " bimis," as the hydrogen and oxygen pass off. 

It is emulsified by mixing with a substance like egg. 

1. To whip cream. — Chill the cream, and set it in a bowl of ice 

water, or chipped ice. If the cream is warm, the beating will 
chum the cream to butter. 

(1) For a fine, close-whipped cream use a Dover egg beater. 

(2) For a lighter whipped cream, use a wire beater. 

2. To mold butter. — A pair of wooden butter pats is necessary 

for this. Dip these first into hot water, then into cold. Cut 
off a square piece of butter, enough for one person, make it 
flat or round with two knives, and then roll it into shape 
between the butter pats. Chill, and serve in a dish on ice; 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 163 

or give one to each person on a butter plate, just at the last 
moment before serving the meal. Never serve soft butter. 

3. To cook bacon. — Bacon has alternate layers of fat and lean, 

but it is the fat that has chief consideration in the cook- 
ing process. The aim is to brown and crisp the fat without 
burning it and without causing a volume of smoke in the 
kitchen. Make ready a frying pan, and have at hand a jar 
for holding fat standing on a plate. Cut the bacon in thin 
slices with a sharp knife. Heat the pan, and put in the bacon. 
The fat will begin to " try out " at the melting point. Pour 
this melted fat into the jar. Turn the pieces of bacon with a fork. 
If the smoke is rising in volumes the pan is too hat. The 
novice should not try this experiment for the first time by her- 
self. The fat may even burst into flame if the pan is too hot. 
When the bacon is sufficiently cooked to become crisp on cool- 
ing, it is ready to serve, by itself, with toast, or with eggs. 

The making of sauces and gravies. — Many sauces and 
gravies are made from a fat, mixed with a starchy substance, 
the two mingled with a liquid. The fat gives flavor and 
nutriment, the starch is used for thickening, the liquid also 
gives flavor. You are now familiar with the cooking of fat 
and starch, and can readily understand that the combination 
of all these ingredients is not an easy matter. The fat will 
float upon the top of the liquid unless the right amount of 
starch or flour is used, and the flour will have a tendency to 
lump. There are several good methods in use. The method 
given for your experiment is one of the simplest, because it 
uses only a few utensils, and gives uniformly good results. 
It requires no more watchfulness than the other methods. 

These sauces and gravies are not foods for little children 
and invalids. 

4. Foundation recipe for sauces. 

Proportions, 

(1) Thin sauce (for milk toast) 

1 tablespoonful of fat, 1 of flour, i pint liquid. 



164 FOODS AND HOVSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

or (2) Medium sauce (for vegetables) . 

2 tablespoonfuls of fat, 2 of flour, i pint liquid. 

or (3) Thicker sauce, also for vegetables, meats, flsh, and 
macaroni. 

3 tablespoonfuls of fat- 3 of flour, i pint liquid. 
Salt is used to taste. 

Method, — Melt the fat in a saucepan. Pour in the flour, 
all at once, and stir the flour and fat together, until the mass 
thickens slightly. Pour in all the liquid at once, cold. Set 
the saucepan where the heat is moderate. 

Stir steadily with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens. 

5. A white sauce is made with butter, and milk the liquid. Stop 

the cooking just short of the boiling point. 

6. A tomato sauce is made with butter or beef fat, strained tomato 

juice the liquid. Cook a piece of onion, a sprig of parsley, 
or a small portion of dried herbs, and a clove with the tomato 
before straining, if these flavors are liked. 

7. A brown sauce or meat gravy may be made in the same way, using 

beef fat, and (as the liquid) water that has been poured into 
the pan in which the meat is cooked. When you are familiar 
with cooking there is an easier way for thickened meat gravies, 
as follows : 

Pour off some of the fat from the meat pan. Set the pan 
upon the stove and stir in the flour, — about two tablespoonfuls 
for the ordinary roasting pan. When the flour is thoroughly 
mixed in, add about a pint of water, cold or warm, and stir 
again. Pour this mixture through a strainer. With practice 
you can make an excellent gravy in this way. It requires 
judgment to proportion the flour and liquid to the material 
in the pan. 

The Sugars 

Sugars are of common occurrence in the vegetable world 
in the fruits and juices of many plants. Pure grape juice 
may contain as high as 25 per cent of glucose though usually 
it is not so concentrated. Glucose is also found in consider- 
able amount in sweet corn and onions. It is not so sweet as

cane sugar (sucrose). Fructose is one of the sweetest of 
sugars, and helps to give honey its great sweetness. 

Lactose or milk sugar is found chiefly in milk. It is the 
least sweet of all the sugars. If there were as much cane 
sugar in milk, we should soon grow tired of it because it would 
be too sweet. It is sometimes added to milk to make its 
fuel value higher, especially in case the milk has been diluted, 
as in the diet of babies and invalids. 

Maltose or malt sugar is formed from starch in germinating 
seeds. 

Sucrose or cane sugar is most commonly manufactured 
from sugar cane and sugar beets. To a much smaller extent 
it is made commercially from the sugar maple, sorghum cane, 
and sugar palm, and it is found in considerable amount in 
some common fruits and vegetables. 

Its manufacture forms a great industry, and its consumption 
is enormous, some ten million tons coming into commerce 
annually, and this does not represent the total consumption. 

Figure 48 shows the composition of several common sugars. 
Notice that the granulated sugar is a pure foodstuff, being 
100 per cent carbohydrate, while all the others contain traces 
of protein, ash, and water. Sugar is a fuel food, exclusively, 
like olive oil and other pure fats. 

Sugar is a valuable food material, but should not be used 
in excess ; the tendency in the United States is rather toward 
an excessive use of sugar. It is liable to cause an acid fer- 
mentation in digestion, when taken in large amounts, and is 
sure to irritate the stomach. It should be well diluted by 
other foods. The amount that may be eaten daily varies 
for most people from two ounces for young children to four 
ounces for adults, but many people cannot eat these amounts 
without more or less irritation of the stomach. It is a com- 
mon practice to oversweeten cakes and desserts, the sweet- 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 167 

ness of the sugar often disguising other agreeable flavors. 
The liking for sweets should be well- under control,, for the 
eating of too much sugar is a habit easy to form, and one 
which crowds put other valuable foods. 

Cane Sugar is sold both brown and white, and is manu- 
factured in powdered, granulated, and solid form, the latter 
usually cut in cubes or dominoes. 

The canes are first crushed, the juices passing from the 
machine being of a rather dark greenish color. This juice 
is first clarified and filtered, and then boiled down in order to 
crystallize the sugar, the liquid sirup forming molasses. 
In the older methods the sirup was boiled in open pans, and 
the crystals filtered from the molasses by a slow process. 
In the modem process the sirup is boiled at a low temperature 
in vacuum pans, and the sugar is separated from the molasses 
by a centrifugal machine, built on the same principle as a 
cream separator. The principles of beet sugar manufacture 
are essentially the same, with some differences in detail. 

The molasses manufactured in the older method is richer 
in cane sugar and is a better table molasses than the new 
process molasses, the latter being used chiefly for the manu- 
facture of alcohol. Molasses is either dark or light, the 
darker having a stronger flavor especially suited to ginger- 
bread and Indian meal pudding. Molasses comes in the 
bulk, and may be slightly acid ; or in cans, in which case no 
acid fermentation should have taken place. Where canned 
molasses is used in a batter, it is sometimes necessary to 
use baking powder instead of soda. " New Orleans " is a 
light-colored molasses, *' Porto Rico " dark. 

Brown sugar has not passed through the refining processes 
necessary to the whitening of the sugar. It is softer than the 
granulated white, has a decided brownish color and a rich 
flavor. 



168 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

In buying sugar it is economy to purchase granulated in 
large quantities, a fraction of a cent per pound being saved 
in this way. The cut sugar comes in convenient boxes, 
which keep the product clean. Powdered sugar may be 
bought in small quantities, three or five pounds, since it is 
not used so much in cooking as the granulated. 

Candy, homemade and purchased. — Candy, if not eaten 
between meals, is an allowable form of sugar. The best 
time for eating it is at the end of a meal, one or two pieces. 
Even in this case, however, it would be better for the body if 
the craving for sweet were satisfied by fruit rather than candy. ' 

Candy made at home costs less than high grade conuner- 
cial candy, even counting in the labor. It is superior to cheap 
grade candy, which may even contain poisonous coloring 
matter. It is a pleasure to make it at times, and it is always 
a pleasing gift at the holiday season. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

A sirup is formed by cooking sugar with water. 

The sirup thickens if process is prolonged and water evaporates. 

Cane sugar is changed to glucose and fructose by boiling with 
an acid. 

Heated without additional water, the sugar is partially decom- 
posed, giving off water and becoming brown in color. This is 
** caramel," used for coloring, and flavoring. 

The final stage of heating leaves pure carbon.

rich brown color. The sugar will lump badly at first, but these 
lumpc will entirely melt in time. Turn the chopped peanuts 
and salt into the sirup and stir together and immediately 
turn out on a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces. 

9. Fudge. 

Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar i teaspoonful 

Chocolate 2 squares 

Milk or water 1 cup 

Vanilla 1 teaspoonful 

Method. — Mix the first four ingredients and place over a 
hot fire. Stir steadily until the mixture begins to boil. Stir 
occasionally after this until, when half a teaspoonful is dropped 
into cold water, it may be rolled to a soft ball with the fingers. 
Set the saucepan in a cool place and leave until it becomes 
just lukewarm. Add the vanilla and stir the mixture until it 
becomes thick and seems very slightly granular. Pour it into 
a buttered tin and as soon as possible cut into squares. The 
exact point at which to remove the fudge from the fire and 
again at which to cease stirring and pour into the pan is a 
matter which only practice can teach. 

10. Penocha. 

Ingredients. 

Brown sugar 2 cups 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk, cream, or water 1 cup 

Cream of tartar J teaspoon or less 

Vanilla 1 teaspoon 

Method. — As with recipe 9. The very dark brown sugar 
contains some acid and therefore less cream of tartar may 
be used. Chopped nuts may be added with the vanilla to 
both fudge and penocha. 

11. Fondant for French creams. 

Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar J teaspoonful 

Boiling water J cup 



170 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method. — Mix the sugar and cream of tartar. Add the 
boiling water and place over a moderate fire, stirring slowly 
and steadily until the sugar is dissolved. Do not stir after 
the mixture begins to boil, but let it boil slowly until the 
sirup will form a soft ball in cold water. Turn out on a platter 
without scraping the saucepan. The success of the fondant 
depends upon the complete changing of the cane sugar into 
fructose and glucose, the crystals of the latter being much finer 
than those of cane sugar. Stirring the mixture while it boils or 
before it has cooled sufficiently will result in the formation of 
cane sugar crystals, and the fondant will be harsh and rough. 

When the fondant is barely lukewarm begin to stir it with 
long steady strokes and continue this until the mixture becomes 
creamy and thick and begins to break away from the sides of 
the dish and the spoon. Then gather it all together into a 
round mass and knead like bread until it becomes pliable. It 
may then be wrapped in oiled paper or put into a covered 
bowl or fruit jar and kept until wanted. 

Fondant is the foundation for all bon bons and may be made 
up into a great variety of shapes and with many flavors. It 
may be mixed with chopped candied fruits or nuts or coated 
with chocolate.

CHAPTER XI 
MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 

Wheat flour is the important material in this group, but 
muffins and biscuit may be varied by the use of corn meal, 
rye, and Graham flour, and cooked cereals may also be uti- 
lized. The ingredients are flour, salt, a liquid, sometimes a 
fat, eggs, and sugar. The flavorings are spices, essences, 
fruit juice, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate. The mixture must 
be smooth, but it is also necessary to make it porous or 
" light." This is accomplished by means of leavening agents, 
" to leaven " meaning '' to make light.'* 

Leavening agents. — The batter, or dough, is leavened by 
introducing into it air or a gas that expands when heated in 
the oven, thus making the whole more porous and larger in 
bulk. 

Air. — This is introduced into the batter by beating, or by beat- 
ing air into the "^hite of egg and stirring the beaten white into the 
batter. 

Steam. — The water in the batter turns to steam in the oven, 
and as it expands it assists in the leavening of the mass. See 
Popovers. 

Carbon dioxide gas. — This is introduced in three ways. 

(1) By using an acid with a carbonate. 

(2) By yeast fermentation. * 

(3) By machinery. 

Yeast fermentation is studied in the chapter on bread making 
(Chapter XII), and the mechanical method is a commercial process 
exclusively. Only the first method will be treated in this 
chapter. 

When an acid and any alkaline carbonate are dissolved together, 

171 



172 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a chemical action takes place, a gas is given off (carbon dioxide) 
and another substance is formed that is neutral, being neither acid 
nor alkaline, and known as a '* salt.*' In selecting the two sub- 
stances we must bear in mind this neutral substance that remains 
in the batter and insure its harmlessness. 

The lactic acid of sour milk is probably the earliest used, being a 
domestic product. The lactic acid is neutralized by bicarbonate 
of sodium, the latter being also called ' * baking soda." The resulting 
salt is harmless. 

Acid molasses with soda is another old-fashioned method. Here 
the acid is developed by the fermentation of the molasses. 

Cream of tartar (acid potassium tartrate), obtained from crystals 
deposited in wine vats, came into use later, neutralized by bicar- 
bonate of soda, two parts of cream of tartar to one of soda. 

Baking powder. — The first baking powders were made of cream 
of tartar and bicarbonate of soda, mixed with a starch, to prevent 
the slight chemical action which would cause the powder to lose 
strength ; and these two substances are now used in the best baking 
powders. The resulting salt is the Rochelle salt of medicine. 

An add phosphate is sometimes used with soda, and this gives 
a harmless neutral substance. . 

Cheaper acids have sometimes been used, especially alum. It 
is best not to use an alum powder. Select a standard kind, avoid- 
ing those that offer prizes for a certain number of boxes purchased. 
Even if these latter do not contain alum, there is probably an excess 
of starch or flour. 

The advantage of baking powder is in the accuracy of the propor- 
tions of the two substances by weight. Even though the measur- 
ing of the cream of tartar and soda separately is accurate, the 
proportions may not be correct. There is no great advantage in 
homemade baking powder. It costs almost as much as the manu- 
factured, and is not as perfect a product. 

The proportions of the main ingredients. — Attempts are 
made to define the degrees of stiffness of batters and doughs, 
but these distinctions are not very accurate. A ''pour bat- 
ter" is liquid enough to pour, and a "dough batter" soft 
enough to drop from a spoon; a "soft dough" is next in 
grade, and " dough " is the stiffest of all. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 173 

To understand proportioning the ingredients, the nature 
of the ingredients when heated must be taken into account. 
Butter and other fats melt when heated, and behave like a 
liquid in the mixture. Therefore, when there is a very large 
amount of butter, no other wetting is necessary, as in pound 
cake. We may make a scale, with a thin popover mixture 
at one extreme, with no butter in it, and the stiff poimd cake 
at the other, with butter the only liquid (except the flavor- 
ing). Between these two are the mixtures of medium stiff- 
ness, with both butter and liquid. This general rule may 
be given: As the quantity of butter is increased, the batter 
must increase in stiffness, and there must be either less liquid 
or more flour. 

A beaten egg looks like a liquid and behaves so during the 
mixing, but in the oven it stiffens. For this reason we can 
make a sponge cake with many eggs and no liquid in the 
mixing, and use no other leavening ^gent than the air beaten 
into the egg. 

One old-fashioned rule for sponge cake reads : Take the 
weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour, 
with the juice and rind of a lemon for ten eggs. Such a rule 
was adapted to the days when eggs were cheap. We should 
now use fewer eggs in sponge cake, and this means that water 
and baking powder must replace the eggs omitted. 

Methods of mixing. — (1) For popover s, griddlecakes, muffins, and 
plain cake. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 

Beat the eggs, without separating the yolk and white, and stir 
the eggs and milk together. 

Pour the liquid gradually into the flour, first stirring, then 
beating. 

Melt the butter or other shortening, and beat it into the batter. 

(2) Biscuits and shortcakes. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 



174 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cut in or chop in the butter. 
Add the wetting slowly. 

(3) A richer f fine-grained butter cake. 
Sift together the dry ingredients. 
Cream the butter, and beat in the sugar. 

Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 

Beat the yolks into the creamed butter and sugar. 

Add the flour and milk alternately ; that is, a quarter or third 
of the flour, then a portion of the milk, and so on. First stir, then 
beat vigorously. 

Fold in the beaten whites lightly and do not beat the mixture 
again. 

(4) Sponge cake. 

If baking powder is used, sift with the flour. 
Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 
Beat the sugar into the yolks, and add the liquid and flavoring. 
Add the flour and beaten whites in alternate x)ortion8, dividing 
both into quarters or thirds. 

Baking. — This is a science and an arl that requires much 
practice. Do not be discouraged if you do not succeed at 
first. 

Concerning the utensils for baking, see Chapter II. The 
cups or pans are prepared by wanning and greasing. Use a 
bit of soft paper or a brush for greasing the pan and 
ordinarily an inexpensive fat, reserving butter for delicate 
cake. Flour sprinkled on a pan is suflScient for biscuit and 
cookies. Line a pan for loaf cake with white paper, and 
grease the paper. 

See that the oven is ready before the mixing begins. We 
shall not be able to bake accurately until our ovens are 
equipped with thermometers. In the meantime we must 
use some simple oven test. The indicators on the doors of 
some ovens are a guide, although they are not really accurate 
according to the scale of the thermometer. A glass door is 
also a convenience. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 175 

A loaf should be baked at a lower temperature than a 
biscuit or mufi^. Why? 

For loaves, 380® F. Test by the hand, counting fifteen 
slowly, fifteen seconds. A piece of white paper will become 
a delicate brown in five minutes. 

For biscuits, muffins^ and small cakes, 425® to 450® F. — 
Test by the hand, a count of ten. A piece of paper becomes 
a deeper golden brown in five minutes. 

Any mixture containing baking powder may stand some 
little time before it is, put in the oven, provided it is kept 
cold. The action of the baking powder is not immediate, 
and is very slight at a low temperature. 

The stages of the baking are first, the rising ; second, the 
crusting over ; third, the baking of the interior ; and last, a 
shrinkage of the whole. 

Many ovens bake unevenly, and pans must be shifted. 
This should be done with care and not before the third stage 
of the baking. It is often well to cool oflf the oven the latter 
part of the time. An oven that is too hot may be cooled by 
a pan of water. Paper may be laid over the top of the cake 
if the browning has been too rapid. These are all make- 
shifts, and indicate a poor oven, or poor management of the 
fire. Do not look into the oven for the first ten minutes of 
baking, and always close the oven door gently. 

When we are privileged to have electric ovens, with glass 
doors, and an accurate thermometer, baking will be an easy 
and accurate process. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

A. Experiments with baking powder. 

1. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of baking powder in two table- 
spoonfuls of water and heat in a test tube, or saucepan, over a 
flame ; notice the effervescence when the bubbUng is at its height, 



176 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and hold a lighted match in the mouth of the tube. This is a simple 
test for oarbon dioxide. 

2. Dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of oream of tartar in i cup water in 
a glass. 

Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda in i cup water in 
a glass. 

Taste both of these. 
, Test both with litmus paper, noting the change of color. There 
are several vegetable coloring matters that change color in this 
way, in the presence of an acid or an alkaline substance. 

Turn the two solutions together, and test with both blue and 
pink litmus paper, after the solution has stood for several minutes. 
What results ? 

Taste this mixed solution to see if you can detect any difference. 

To prove that there is a substance still left, evaporate Jhe water. 

3. A pretty form of this experiment is to use, instead of litmus 
the water in which red cabbage has previously been boiled and 
which therefore contains some of the coloring matter of the cabbage. 
The changes in color are very striking, and prove conclusively that 
neither the cream of tartar nor the soda remains such. 

B, Oven experiments. 

If one oven in the school kitchen can be equipped with a chemi- 
cal thermometer inserted in the oven, the following experiments 
are helpful. 

1. Let each pupil test the oven by feeling, when it has reached 
380° F., 400° F., 425° F., 450° F., 475° F.-500° F. 

2. Place pieces of white paper, one for each pupil, in the oven 
for five minutes at the various temperatures. These may be pasted 
in the notebook for future reference.

MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 177 

Special pointsA — The liquid must be poured very slowly into 
the flour to prevent lumping. A large Dover egg beater is 
convenient for beating out lumps, if any occur. 

The leavening of the popover is effected by steam, and it 
is not necessary therefore to spend time and strength in the 
long beating sometimes recommended. This has been con- 
clusively proved by experiment. Neither is it necessary to 
put the batter into the oven immediately, as sometimes di- 
rected. It may stand all day or even over night. 

Pour the batter in the hot cups, having each cup two thirds 
full. The baking of the popovers is unique, in that they should 
be put into an intensely hot oven for the first stage of the baking 
— as hot as 475** F., or even more — then the oven must be 
cooled. This first stage crusts the top; then the expansive 
force of the steam pushes up the top ; and the muffin " pops " or 
" puffs " over. The more moderate heat cooks the sides and 
the bottom, and makes an agreeable crust. The perfect puff- 
over is hollow. Three quarters of an hour is the average time 
of baking. If at the end of that time the oven door is set ajar, 
and the popovers aUowed to remain longer, they are improved, 
coming from the oven stiff and crisp with a rich brown color, 
rather than soft and underdone. In an old family cookbook, 
one recipe, sixty years old, caUs popovers " Mahogany Cakes." 

They may be eaten as a muffin, or served with a pudding 
sauce as a dessert.

(c) One cup Graham or rye meal in place of an equal 
quantity of flour. 

3. Baking powder biscuit. 

Ingredients, 

Flour 1 pint 

Baking powder 3 teaspoonfuls 

Salt 1 teaspoonful 

Butter, or butter substitute 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk 1 scant cup 

For shaping^ molding board, rolling pin, and biscuit cutter. 

For baking^ an iron sheet or pan sprinkled with flour. Oven 
about 425° F., a ten-second test, or golden brown paper. 
Bake twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Method of mixing is No. 2. 

To shape. Dust the board with flour, turn out the dough, 
dredge with flour, pat into a firm mass, and then pat or lightly 
roll out to 1 inch thickness. Cut out with a cutter dipped in 
flour. (A small glass or the top of a round tin can may be used. ) 

Variations. — Add 1 egg. This makes a delicious biscuit. 
Sprinkle the top with granulated sugar, and spice. Dried 
currants washed, and dredged with flour, may be laid on the top. 

Increase the butter to two or three tablespoonfuls, and de- 
crease the wetting and the mixture becomes shortcake. This 
is the mixture to use for the true strawberry shortcake. Many 
other fruits may be used, both uncooked and cooked.

The method of mixing is No. 3. Notice that this is a stiff 
dough. The amount of flour depends somewhat upon the ex- 
pertness of the cooky maker. The flour used in rolling out 
must be accounted for, as the expert can manage a softer 
. dough than the novice. Mix the baking powder and salt with 
one cup of the flour. 

Shaping the cookies. — Figure 49 shows you the apparatus. 
The dough is turned out upon the floured board, gently rolled 
out to a quarter of an inch, cut and placed in a floured pan ; or 
cut off a small piece, roll in the flour, until it forms a ball, set 
the ball in the pan, and pat it down to a round. This may seem 
to take longer, but it is easier, and there is no board to clean 
afterward. 

A plainer cooky is made with i cup butter, and i cup water 
or milk, with somewhat more flour.

Method. — Melt butter in boiling water. Mix dry ingredients. 
Add the molasses to the water and butter and stir this mix- 
ture into the dry ingredients, beating vigorously. Pour into a 
buttered shallow pan and bake twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven. If the molasses is taken from a freshly opened can, no 
acid will be present and the soda should be omitted and 3 tear 
spoonfuls of baking powder used instead. 

Pastry. — Pastry is a stiff dough with a large proportion 
of shortening, and is flaky when baked rather than porous. 
Pastry and pies should not be used as a staple food, but when 
well made and properly masticated, pies may be eaten oc- 
casionally by people in good health. The crust should be 
flaky, and thoroughly baked. 



Lctboratory management. — Effective work in batters cannot be accom- 
plished with less than \ cup liquid, though a smaller portion is sometimes 
used. It is well to have some group work, so that the pupils may learn to 
beat larger quantities. If there is a school lunch room, large quantities 
may be utilized there.

2. Method of mixing for all. 

Have all the ingredients and utensils icy cold. Mix the dry 
ingredients and cut in the fat with two knives. Stir in the ice 
water until the dough will just hold together. Toss upon a 
floured board and roll to i inch or less in thickness. Roll this 
up. If not ready to be used, this pie crust may be covered 
with moist cheesecloth and put on the ice until wanted. This 
amount of crust will make two medium-sized pies with two 
crusts each. 

3. Method of shaping. 

For plain crust. — Cut oflf i of the roll of crust. Roll out 
to about i inch thickness. Have a deep dish ready contain- 
ing either the apple or meat fillings (see recipes below) and 
with the edge of dish buttered. Invert a small cup in the 
center of the dish to hold up the crust if apples are used. 
Lay the roUed-out crust over the top, having rolled it a little

• 
larger than the dish. Turn under the edges of the crust and 
crimp them down on the dish. Make several small cuts in the 
top of the crust to let the steam escape. Bake in a moderate 
oven until the filling (if apples) is cooked and the crust brown. 

For short crust. — Cut off i of the roll of crust and roll out 
very thin, keeping the shape round. Line a buttered pie 
plate with the crust. Fill this with the desired filling, moisten 
the edge of bottom crust with water, and cover with another ♦ 
round of crust rolled as before. Crimp down the edges of the 
top crust and make cuts in the top as before. Bake until the 
fiUing is cooked and the crust is brown. 

For rich crust. — Roll the crust to i inch thickness. Have 
ready J cup ice-cold fat. Cut off small bits of this and spread 
it in dabs over the roUed-out crust. Roll this again and then 
proceed as for the !* short " crust (2). 

12. Apple pie filling. 

Use juicy, tart apples. Pare, cut in quarters, core, and 
slice apples into pie dish, filling it heaping full. Add } cup 
water and i cup sugar. Any flavor desired may be used, lemon 
rind, or spices. A little butter gives an agreeable flavor. 

13. Lemon pie filling. 

Ingredients. 

1 heaping tablespoonful corn- ( 1 egg whole, or 

starch mixed with ( yolks of 2 eggs 

A little cold water Juice and rind of 1 lemon 

Large cup hot water A very little salt 

Piece butter the size of walnut Whites of 2 eggs 

1 cup sugar Powdered sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful 

Method. 

Mix the starch with the cold water, add the boiling water 
and cook until it thickens, and add the butter and sugar. 
Beat the egg (or yolks) and add the other ingredients. Add the 
lemon last. When the pie is done, if two yolks were used, beat 
the whites with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, place on the 
top, and brown in a moderate oven.

14. Meat or chicken pie. 

Use left-over, cooked meat. Cut the meat into dice or small 
bits and fill the dish. Sprinkle with salt and moisten with 
gravy, if possible. If not, add 1 cup hot water and dredge 
lightly with flour. Have top crust only. 

How would the time for cooking this pie compare with that 
for deep apple pie?

CHAPTER XII 
YEAST BREAD 

Yeast bread when well made is a food of which the palate 
never tires, and it is usually recognized as a part of every well- 
planned meal. The quick breads are a convenient substi- 
tute at times, but they are not the staff of life in the same 
sense, and are, on the whole, less widely used. 

The making of a perfect loaf of bread is the goal of all 
those who aspire to excel in cookery ; and the art of bread 
making requires not only a clear understanding of the imder- 
lying principles, but patience and persistence in experimen- 
tation and practice until a uniformly perfect product is 
achieved. The fact that in yeast we have a living organism 
with which to deal makes the whole process a delicate one, 
in which every detail is of importance, whether it be a matter 
of ingredients^ proportions, methods of mixing, or tempera- 
ture. 

The standard of good bread. — There will always be some 
difference of opiiiion in regard to a desirable quality in bread, 
and individual preference will control the final result, whether 
the crumb of the bread shall be dry and porous or somewhat 
more moist and finer in grain. French bread is of the former 
type, the English preferring a close grain and solid loaf. 
Allowing for these differences, it is still possible to standardize 
bread, and to state in percentages the different points to be 
considered in judging a loaf. 

We must consider the size and symmetry of the loaf, in 

order that the interior of the bread may be baked to the very 

187 



188 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

center, without overbaking or burning the crust, and there- 
fore very large loaves should be avoided. The crust should 
be uniform in color, the shade ranging from a light golden 
to a darker brown, and the quality may be soft or crisp, but 
never tough. The crumb should be light, the cavities evenly 
distributed throughout the loaf and of uniform size. It 
should also be elastic, tender, and yet not pasty, evenly 
baked without streaks and heavy portions near the crust, 
and the color should be creamy rather than a snowy white. 
(Fig. 65.)

Note. — These two score cards are the average of the work of 
sixty students in judging bread in experimental cookery. Depart- 
ment of Foods and Cookery, Teachers College, Colimibia Univer- 
sity. See also Bulletin 25, University of lUinois. 

Digestibility and nutritive value. — Bread of the standard 
described is readily digestible when at least twelve hours old 
and stands high in nutritive value. Figure 61 compares 
the composition of several varieties. 

Like the cereals, it has considerable protein, and some fat, 
but is highest in starch. The white bread, unless made with 
milk, has very little ash. A slice almost one inch thick 
weighing 1.38 ounces, from a baker's five-cent loaf, will yield 
100 Calories. 

The cost of bread. -^ The table in Chapter XVII states 
the amount of protein and energy obtained for ten cents from 
bread as compared with other common foods, and makes the 
fact clear that bread is essentially one of the cheapest foods, 
remaining relatively so whatever the general fluctuations in 
food prices may be. 

A pound loaf of bread at the bakery should cost five cents, 
the cost being slightly less when the bread is made at home, 
even taking the fuel into account. It is an open question, 
however, whether bread should be made at home or bought 
at the bakery, all the circumstances being weighed in the 
balance by the individual. (See Chapter XVII.) In America, 
we need to leam to dictate and control the methods in the 



YEAST BREAD 191 

public bakeries because bakers' bread is being used more and 
more, although it is said that 50 per cent is still made at 
home. If bread is to be bought, it is necessary for the house-^ 
keeper to understand the bread-making process and the 
standard of good bread that she may criticize intelligently, 
and force the public bakeries to furnish bread made under 
ideal conditions. Such bread is supplied in France, where 
the housekeepers in the city, though noted for their 
thrift, do not think of bread making at home as a practical 
or economical procedure. It must be understood that the 
baker's oven is fitted to do better work than the small oven 
of the average kitchen, and if the public through laws and in- 
spection will control the quality of the materials used and 
the cleanliness of the process, baker's bread will be a useful 
" ready-cooked " food. 

The ingredients of bread. — The essential ingredients are 
flour, water, and yeast. The liquid may be milk, or milk 
and water, the milk changing the flavor slightly and increas- 
ing the nutritive value, while the cream in the milk increases 
the tenderness of the cnmib and crust. The non-essentials 
include salt to develop flavor, sugar sometimes added to 
hasten fermentation and also for flavor, and a fat to increase 
tenderness, as, for instance, butter or some cheaper fat. 
Spices and dried fruits are used in sweet breads, and when 
eggs are added sweet bread becomes a plain cake having a 
delicious and characteristic flavor. 

The characteristics of good flour. — The average com- 
position of flour is as follows : 

Protein 11.4 per cent 

Fat 1.0 " 

Carbohydrate 75.1 " 

Fuel value 1610 Cal. per pound 

100-Calorie portion 28 grams (1 ounce)

The protein occurs in the form of gluten, which has the 
property of stretching and expanding, and which makes the 
framework of the loaf of bread, since it retains the air and 
carbon dioxide, and hardens when baked. The protein of 
oats and com lacks ttiis property, and therefore oatmeal and 
com meal give a very different type of bread. Rye flour 



lit AtrlcaUvrat CeOiti. 



contains gluten, and the rye loaf therefore resembles the 
wheat loaf. Wheat and flour differ lai^ely on account of 
the difference in the amount of gluten, and the gluten itself 
varies in quality with the variety of wheat. 

Figure 52 shows the result of an experiment with flour 
made from different kinds of wheat, all the other factors in 
the bread making being identical. This effect of the differ- 
ence in the composition of the flour is very striking. Again, 
the same variety of wheat will differ from season to season, 



YEAST BREAD

and the time of planting, also, affects the quality of the 
grain. The time of planting and reaping gives us two classes 
of wh6at and flour, the winter and spring. Winter wheat 
is sown in the fall and obtains its first growth before winter, 
living through the winter in those latitudes where the climate 
is suflBciently mild, being harvested in early smnmer. Spring 
wheat is sown in the spring and harvested late and it is the 
wheat of the great flour-producing state, Minnesota. The 
difference in the composition of the two wheats is shown in 
this table.^

Note that the spring wheat contains more protein and there- 
fore more gluten. The flour from spring wheat is creamy in 
color, granular to the touch, has more gluten, and is known 
as a strong flour. Flour from winter wheat is somewhat whiter 
in color and smoother to the touch, feeling more like corn- 
starch, and if a portion is squeezed in the hand, it retains 
the unprint of the fingers. It has less gluten, more starch, 
and is known as a soft flour. This type of flour is some- 
times called " pastry flour," the smaller percentage of gluten 
making it more desirable for pastry or cake than the stronger 
flour. 

Flour manufacturers and bakers are constantly experi- 
menting to find the best possible varieties and combinations 
of varieties for bread flour. Some difference of opinion exists, 

^ U. S. Department of A^culture, Fanners' Bulletin 389, p. 16. 
o 



194 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



but a combination of winter and spring wheat in flour is 
considered the beat for bread by some authorities. 

We must leam to like a creamy color in bread, for this 
means the presence of more gluten. To summarize : a good 
bread Sour contains a large percentage of gluten, is creamy 
in color, and granular to the touch. 

Manufacture of flour. — Modem machinery has taken the 
place of the old-time stones in the grinding of flour, although 
the two main divisions of the 
process remain the same, these 
being the crushing of the grain 
and the sifting out of the coarse 
portion. Milling now includes 
many stages in the process not 
possible with the cruder ma- 
chinery of former times, and the 
present effects a greater number 
of separations and permits the 
miller to make a greater variety 
of products. 

Figure 53 shows a dissected 
kernel of wheat, with its five 
layers of bran. Within these at 
cmriamfwaiiaiirncrDiinica. B is a shell of glutiuous matter, 
Pio. 53. — A dissected grain of yellowish and of fUnty hardness, 
, " ^* " and within this, but not sharply 

divided from it, lie the starch granules in a network of woody 
fiber, the germ lying at A. The milling process must remove 
the bran coats and the germ, and crush and roll the remain- 
ing portions to the necessary fineness. The germ if allowed 
to remain affects the color and keeping properties. The 
breaking and rolUng are accomplished by steel machinery, 
and the final sifting is done through silk bolting cloth. By 



YEAST BREAD 195 

the new machinery about 70 per cent of the wheat is saved 
for food, 30 per cent being bran, " shorts," and other by- 
products used chiefly for cattle feeding. 

Figure 54 shows the vertical section of a mill, simplified 
in the drawing that all the steps of the process may be clear. 
The diagram does not, of course, show the actual arrange- 
ment of the mill.^ 

The typical parts in a modem flour mill are as follows: 
(1) Scales, for weighing wheat as it is received. (2) Receiv- 
ing separator, for separating other kinds of seeds from wheat. 
(3) Storage bins, for reserve supply of wheat in advance of 
mill requirements. (4) Mill separator, for further separating 
foreign seeds from wheat. (5) Scourer, for removing dust 
from wheat kernels. (6) Cockle cylinder, for removing all 
round seeds. (7) Wheat washer, for thoroughly cleansing 
the wheat. (8) Wheat dryer, for drjdng wheat after washing. 
(9) 1st break rolls, for rupturing bran, enabling bran and 
germ to be separated from interior. (10) Ist^break scalper, 
for sifting middlings through bolting cloth to separate from 
bran. (11) 2d break rolls, for further loosening the mid- 
dlings from bran. (12) 2d break scalper, for separating 
more middlings from bran. (13) 3d break rolls, for further 
loosening middlings from bran. (14) 3d break scalper, for 
final separation of middlings from bran. (15) Bran duster, 
for dusting low grade flour from bran. (16) Bran bin, for 
packing bran for shipment. (17) Grading reel, for separating 
middlings by sifting through various sizes of bolting cloth. 
(18) Dust collector and purifier, for cleaning and purifjdng 
middlings by air and sifting. (19) Smooth rolls, for grinding 
purified middlings very fine to flour. (20) Flour bolter, for 
sifting flour from purified middlings. (21) 2d reduction

Other forms of flour. — There has been much discussion 
of entire wheat flour versiis white flour, and the practical 
conclusions are as follows: the bread from whole wheat 
flour compares favorably with that from white flour (see 
Fig. 51), but this material is slightly less available for 
digestion than the material of the white flour. The mineral 
content is higher, and when the income is so limited that this 
cannot be furnished in milk, green vegetables, and fruit, 
whole wheat bread should be used. It makes a pleasing 
variety, too, for any table. 

Graham flour is a coarse flour, containing the outer bran. 
It is useful for its effect upon the intestines in case of con- 
stipation, but has to be avoided by some people on account 
of its irritating effect. White flour may have coarser mate- 
rial mixed with it, for variety in bread making, such as rye or 
Indian meal, or graham flour. 

Yeast in bread. — Yeast is put into bread dough in order 
to produce carbon dioxide gas to Hghten the whole mass. It 
is studied in the chapter on preservation of fruit, but in 
bread making we need ;to foster its growth instead of destroy- 
ing it as, you will recall, we found necessary in preserving. 
You can easily reason out for yourself just how this should be 
done, especially after performing the experiments with yeast. 

If yeast is in good condition, it has little effect on the flavor 
of bread, even if used in a rather large quantity to hasten the 
process. 

The best forms of yeast now in use are the compressed 
and dried cakes, the former needing to be fresh, the latter 



198 FOODS AND HOUSEHOlsD MANAGEMENT 

keeping the vitality of the yeast cells for a long time. Liquid 
yeast may be made at home, but it is somewhat uncertain 
imless made with great exactness, and less easy to manage 
on the whole than the other forms. 

Proportions of the ingredients. — One part of water to 
three of flour, or one cup to three of flour for a loaf, is an 
average proportion. The practiced bread maker will vary 
this slightly to suit the variations in the flour from time to 
time, but it is a safe rule for the beginner to follow. Winter 
wheat flour requires somewhat more water than the spring 
wheat, or the blend of the two. Salt should be used sparingly, 
for although it improves the flavor of the loaf, salt is a pre- 
servative which retards or prevents the growth of lower 
organisms, and in the case of bread it acts therefore as a 
check to fermentation. One teaspoonful to a loaf is the 
largest amoimt that it is best to use. 

The quantity of yeast depends upon several conditions. 
The larger the amount of yeast used, the shorter is the time 
of rising, and as many as two compressed yeast cakes may be 
used to one loaf if it is necessary to hasten the process, with- 
out any perceptible effect on the color, texture or flavor. 
If a very large amount of yeast is used, the bread is 
" crumbly," and a difference in flavor will be noticed. A 
smaller amount may be used if time is allowed for the rising, 
even \ cake of compressed yeast to a loaf, if the bread is to 
rise over night in warm weather. It must be remembered 
that, if the rising process is too prolonged, other organisms 
have a chance to work, and the bread may sour. 

A small amount of sugar hastens fermentation, and from 
one to two teaspoonfuls to a loaf may be used* Many 
people prefer the flavor of bread with no sugar, however. 
Some bakers use malt extract both as a yeast food to hasten 
fermentation and for its effect upon the flavor. 



bW. 



200 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Fat J or shortening J should be sparingly used, not more than 
one or two teaspoonfuls being allowed to a loaf. If you 
study a number of bread recipes, you will see that this in- 
gredient varies more than the others. As a matter of fact, 
if the flour is of good quality and the bread well made, this 
ingredient is not necessary (in loaf bread at least), although 
it seems to improve the quality of biscuit and rolls. 

Methods of mixing and the rising of bread. — Dissolve 
the yeast in a portion of the liquid, stir this mixture into the 
remaining Uquid, add half the flour, and beat the mixture 
thoroughly at this stage. Add the sugar if any is to be used. 
When this soft mixture, called the "sponge," becomes full of 
bubbles, add the salt, the shortening if used, and the remain- 
ing flour. Knead the dough by the hand, or by the machine, 
for about ten minutes, or imtil it is smooth and elastic. 
Put it into a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow the 
dough to remain until it doubles its bulk. Some bread 
makers knead in all the flour at the first, and obtain a good 
result. The first rising is more rapid, however, and expe- 
rience seems to prove that the results are better on the whole 
with the sponge. Cut the dough down, knead again, using 
as little flour as possible. Shape into loaves, place the loaves 
in greased pans, cover, and leave again until the loaves double 
their bulk, when they are ready for baking. If left too long, 
the bubbles of gas become too large. 

Temperature and time are important, in this matter of 
mixing and using. The process may be shortened to five or 
six hours, including the baking, or lengthened to twenty-four 
by the choice of the amount of yeast and the temperature. 
The shorter process is the better, on the whole. After 
reading over the sections of the chapter on preservation of 
fruit, performing the yeast experiments, and discussing the 
results, you will be able to answer these questions : 



YEAST BREAD 201 

1. What should be the temperature of the ingredients when 
the bread is mixed ? 

2. If milk is used, how may the souring of the milk be prevented ? 

3. What temperature will you secure for the bread while it is 
rising? 

4. If an emergency occurs, and the dough cannot be kneaded 
or baked at the moment it is ready, what can be done ? Can you 
think of two expedients ? 

A few suggestions. — The kneading stretches the gluten 
and long kneading gives a fine grain. In such a recipe as 
that for the making of Parker House rolls, a very 4'elicate 
quality results from a protracted process ; one old-fashioned 
housekeeper recommends a half hour's kneading three times. 
Fortunately a sufficiently good bread or roll may be made 
by ten or fifteen minutes' kneading at a time. 

Bread dough may be cut or stirred with a large knife in 
place of the kneading, and this is a good method to teach to 
those who live in crowded space and find it difficult to have 
a perfectly clean kitchen and proper utensils. With this 
method the dough must be softer, and it remains in the bowl 
until it is turned into the baking pan. The resulting loaf is 
somewhat moist, and not fine-grained, but the flavor is good. 

Brushing the surface of the dough in the bowl or pan with 
water or milk will prevent the formation of a dry crust on the 
top. 

• Baking the bread. — The temperature of the oven should 
be steady, and about 380° F. An authority recommends 
180*^ C. (355*^ F.) when the loaf is put in, rising to 220° C. 
(425° F.).^ The amount of flour for one loaf has been given. 
A loaf this size should be baked in a pan 8| to 9 inches X 
3§ to 4 X 3 to 3 J. The material of the pan is not of great 
consequence. Tin gives good results, a longer time being

7. Toast. — Directions for making toast will be found in Chapter 
IV. 

To serve toast — Toast should be served as soon as it is made, 
if possible, and if not must be kept hot. Fold it in a napkin. 
Toast may also be buttered, piled neatly on a plate, and kept 
hot in the oven until it is time for serving. 

For milk toast the bread is cut somewhat thicker than for 
buttered toast. The milk is prepared by thickening. No. 1 under 
White Sauce. Dip each slice of toast in the thickened milk 
and then put the slices in a dish for serving and pour the thick- 
ened milk over. To moisten toast that is too dry, or when 
moist toast is wanted to serve under some other food, place it 
in a steamer or colander over boiling water a few minutes be- 



Lahoratory management. — For individual work or for work in groups of 
two, the use of i cup of liquid will be found to make as small an amount 
of dough as it is desirable to handle. In making the white bread two por- 
tions may be baked in one tin, brushing with butter where the two por- 
tions touch each other, so that the loaves will separate when baked. 

. Where it is necessary to hurry the process not less than J yeast cake 
should be used with this quantity. 

It is impossible in an ordinary school period to complete the entire pro- 
cess. A number of solutions will occur to the teacher. One of these is to 
arrange the lessons as follows : 

Lesson I. 

Yeast experiments, summary, bread mixed in groups and set to rise, 
demonstration by teacher of kneading, using dough previously prepared. 

Lesson II.

fore buttering it. This is muoh better than toast moistened 
with boiling water. 

8. The sandwich. — The sandwich is a eonvenient way of serving 

bread and other foods away from the table, for picnics, teas, 
and receptions. 

To prepare the bread. — Either white or brown bread may 
be used. Select a well-shaped loaf of fine grain that will not 
crumb when it is sliced. Cut off the end of the loaf, spread 
the loaf evenly with butter, cut a thin slice, butter again, and 
so on. The butter should be softened. Be careful to spread 
it evenly and see that it is near the edge of the bread. Sand- 
wiches may be made either with or without the crust. If the 
crust is to be removed, cut it off die loaf before buttering and 
slicing. 

The filing, — There is an endless variety of filling pos- 
sible for sandwiches, from slices of meat and poultry, which 
make a substantial luncheon for picnics, to the dainty fillings 
used for afternoon teas and receptions. A crisp bit of lettuce 
leaf with Mayonnaise dressing is always acceptable. Cream 
cheese mixed with nuts and raisins is a good filling. For a 
sweet sandwich, jam or jelly may be spread on the slices and 
possibly a small amount of crecun cheese put between. You 
can invent many combinations. 

The shape of the sandwich may be oblong, triangular, or round. 
The round sandwich is cut with a sharp cooky cutter. The 
pieces remaining may be dried and used for bread crumbs. 
The crusts may always be utilized in this way. 

9. Croutons. — Cut a slice of bread a day old i inch thick. Spread 

with soft butter, cut off the crust, put the slices in a pan, 
cut in cubes and set the pan in the oven until the croutons are 
brown.

MEATS AND POULTRY 

The meats that we commoDly use are derived from the 
flesh of domestic and wild animals of herbiverous habits 
and from fowls. The flesh of carnivorous 
animals is seldom used as food. The vari- 
ous kinds are obtained as follows :

Beef 


Ox 


Veal 


Calf 


Mutton 


Sheep 


Lamb

Pork 


Pig 


Ham and bacon

Under the head of poultry we include the 
conunon fowl, turkeys, ducks and geese, 
the guine^. hen, and game birds. 

Quality of good meat. — Tfae quality of 
meat is dependent on the condition of the 
animal from which it is derived. The crea^ Fio. 57.— Fiber cells 
ture should be in perfect health and well ^^'° musoukr 
fed. Good beef is largely obtained from 
the cattle ranges of the West, but there is no reason why 
cattle should not be raised to greater extent in the East. 
Sheep for mutton are best raised where the climate is not 
too severe. Methods of slaughter, transportation, and pres-

ervation all affect the quality of beef. The pure food laws 
and Federal meat inspection law are valuable to the consumer 
in their control of the quality of the meat, that it shall be 
free from disease and from adulterations. See Chapter XVII 
for the discussion of preservatives and pure food laws.

In meat as it is purchased we have bone, fat, and the 
flesh, consisting of the muscle of the animal with its con- 
nective tissue. The color of the meat should be clear and 
fairly bright, not purplish or dull. There should be Httle 
or no odor, and the meat should be firm and elastic to the 
touch. 

Beef should be a bright red and well streaked with fat. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 211 

Veal should be pink and is some- 
what less firm than beef If watery 
and flabby, it is too young. 

Mutton is a duller red, and Srm. 
The fat is white or slightly yellow 
and hard. 

Latnb is pink, rather than red, 
and slightly less firm. 

Pork is rather pale, somewhat 
less firm than beef and mutton, and 
the fat is softer. 

Tough and tender meat. — To 
understand the difference between 
the tough and tender cuts we must 
be familiar with the structure of the 
muscle (see Fig. 57). Each muscle 
consists of bundles of tubes held 
together by connective tissue. In 
tough meat, the muscle tubes are 
thicker and there is more connective 
tissue present. Exercise strength- 
ens the muscle, and this accounts 
for the fact that the unexercised 
muscles of the young animal pve 
us a softer meat. In the mature 
animal the muscles most exercised 
furnish the tough meat, and the 

less used muscles the tender. If g. kg bone: >•. socket bone; 

you study Fig. 58, you can easily L"^" ^"^^ '^^ ';rri^"^ 
determine where the tough meat "■■'"Brib, 
will occur, if you think of the proportionate amount of 
exercise that the different muscles receive. The tough cuts 
come from the neck and legs, the tender cuts from the middle

of the back, the toughness increasing as the cuts approach 
the neck and the hind legs. The muscles of the abdomen 
are also tender, but they give a coarse-grained meat. The 
various cuts of meat are shown as they occur in the standing 
animal in Fig. 58, and in the hind and fore quarters hanging, in 
Figs. 59 and 60. The individual cuts of beef and mutton are 
shown in the figures that follow. The tender cuts from the 
ribs and loin are the most highly prized, and therefore bring 
the highest price. These cuts are liked because of their ten- 
derness although the nutritive value of the tough meat is as 
high or possibly even higher than that of the tender. All 
meat is now high priced, and you will find the reasons for 
this discussed in Chapter XVII. For the sake of economy we 
are forced to use the relatively cheaper cuts, and to seek for 
meat substitutes. We must also take pains to use the cook- 
ing processes that will make the tough meats palatable. 

Composition and nutritive value. — Figure 64 shows you 
the composition of several common meats. Meat is valuable 
chiefly for its protein, fat, and mineral salts. The juices of 
the meat in the muscle cells contain nitrogenous extractive 
materials which give flavor, and are possibly stimulating, 
but they have no food value. From the bone and also from 
the connective tissue, gelatin is dissolved in cooking. Gela- 
tin is a protein, but differs in certain chemical properties 
from other proteins, and cannot be used as the only source of 
nitrogen. It is a very useful protein, however, and as it can 
be substituted in part for more expensive proteins, it used 
to be called a " protein saver." 

In spite of the fact that meat is a common article of diet 
it should not be used in excess. Other forms of protein, as 
those in eggs and milk, are usually digested as easily, and 
most people can digest vegetable proteins if the vegetables 
are carefully prepared. Very little children should not have 



216 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

meat, for it has stimulating properties which are undesirable 
for them, and it takes away the taste for foods more important 
for growth (see Food for Growth, Chapter XVIH). When 
used largely in the diet, meat tends to cause intestinal putre- 
faction and to form excess of acid in the body. It is less 
likely to be harmful if taken with plenty of fruits and green 
vegetables and liberal drinking of clear water. 

It should be realized that in none of the European coun- 
tries is meat used so liberally as in the United States, and 
that there are reasons to believe that we might be better off 
if we could satisfy ourselves with a meat consumption nearer 
the average of other civilized peoples — say half as much 
meat per person per year as we are now accustomed to use. 
The fuel value of meat depends largely upon the amount of 
fat which is eaten. If a pound of steak contains 2 ounces of 
fat and 14 ounces of clear lean; the rejection of the fat means 
a loss of fully one half of the fuel value. The following table 
shows the difference between raw meat of the same cut, free 
from bones and connective tissue, due to differences in amounts 
of fat. Most people would prefer the strictly lean meat.

Dangers from meat. — Three dangers from meat must be 
recognized; (1) animal parasites, such as the trichina some- 
times found in pork, (2) poisons developed in the meat by 
bacteria when it is kept too long or without sufficient refrigera- 
tion, this danger being recognized as ptomaine poisoning, 
(3) bacteria, sometimes present in meat, which are directly 
injurious to man and which are now held to be the cause of 
most of the sickness conmionly attributed to ptomaine 
poisoning. Government protection must be given us here, 
but the housekeeper too has a responsibility. If the raw meat 
has failed to receive proper inspection, we can protect our- 
selves by cooking the meat to a degree that will kill any 
' parasite present. For this reason meat should not be served 
that looks raw or too underdone. The cooked meat should 
be pink rather than red. 

Meat poisoning may be avoided in the first place by exer- 
cising great care in regard to the odor of meat. Meat may 
hang to " ripen," as the butchers say, but one must learn to 
distinguish between the odor of properly ripened meat, and 
that of even slightly tainted meat. Quite as important is 
the rapid cooling of meat, poultry, fish, and soups that are 
not to be used at once. Cases of digestive disturbance and 
even actual poisoning sometimes occur when underdone 
meat, especially lamb, veal, or poultry, remains warm over- 
night. 

The effect of heat upon meat. — The fat of meat is 
melted by heat. The meat fiber shrinks and hardens

with intense heat; on the other hand it softens at a 
temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water. 
The structm*e of the muscle must be studied further in order 
to make the principles of cooking perfectly clear. If you 
think of the structure of the muscle cell as somewhat 
resembling the structure of an orange, you can picture quite 
clearly what happens under different conditions. Open a 
section of orange and separate some of the single cells. These 
may represent the muscle cells of meat that can be seen only 
under the microscope. If you cut across one of these tiny 
cells, the contents will escape, and this is what happens when 
the muscle cells are cut across. Then, too, if the muscle is 
heated, the juices will pass through the membrane of the 
cell, and this happens, too, if the meat is put into cold water. 
The substances in the juices of the meat which are not 
coagulated by heat are called the extractives, because they 
can be extracted by hot water. The most valuable protein 
matter remains behind in the muscle cell, however. Among 
these proteins are those known as meat albumin, and this 
behaves in cooking very much as does the white of egg, — 
that is to say, it coagulates. 

Bearing these facts in mind, we can decide just what to do 
in order to bring about the result that we desire in meat 
cookery, for sometimes we wish to extract the juices and 
sometimes we wish to have all, or nearly all, retained in the 
meat. We are now ready to state the principles of meat 
cookery as follows : 

1. Juices retained. 

In broiling, pan broiling, roasting, and boiling the high 
temperature coagulates the meat albumin and hardens the 
fiber on the surface, thus forming a coating which prevents 
the further escape of juices. In the roasting and boiling of 



MEATS AND POULTRY 221 

large pieces the temperature may then be lowered to pre- 
vent the further shrinking and hardening of the fiber in the 
interior of the meat, which comes from a protracted high 
temperature. With a very thick steak after the smface 
searing the cooking may be completed in the oven. 

2. Juices extracted. 

In beef juice or beef tea, this may be made by placing 
the chopped beef in a jar and placing the jar in an oven, or 
in hot water ; or for beef tea and ordinary soup by putting 
the chopped meat, or small pieces of meat, in cold water and 
heating the water slowly. 

3. Juices partly retained and partly extracted. 

This is desirable in stews, in braised beef, and in pot roast. 
State for yourself just how this would be accomplished. 

4. Connective tissue softened at low temperature, and with 

water. 

5. Sterilization by continued heat which destroys parasites 

and bacteria. 

6. Rapid cooling^ when serving is not inunediate. 

Flavors suitable with meat. 

Herbs. All the pot herbs including savory, marjoram, thyme, 
sage, pot marigold. 

Vegetables. Onion,* carrot, turnip, celery, celery root, parsley 
root and leaf. 

Spices. Clove, allspice, mustard, red, black, and white pepper. 
Some nationalities use nutmeg. 

Acids. Lemon, tomato, and other acid fruits. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

Experiment A. 

Chop finely a small piece of meat, squeeze out the juice with a 
lemon squeezer and heat this juice in a saucepan. Observe the 
coagulation that takes place. 



222 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Experiment B. 

(1) Apparatus, — If ];)ossible, 2 glass beakers, 1 square wire 
net. If these are not available, use an ordinary tumbler and a 
small saucepan. 

(2) Method. — a. Put a small piece of meat in a beaker with 
cold water, and allow it to stand. 

5. Bring water to the boiling point in the beaker on the net 
over the gas flame. Throw in a small piece of meat. 

Compare the appearance of the two pieces of meat and the water 
in the two beakers. 

1. Broiled steak. — (1) Wipe steak with a damp cloth. If a wood 

or coal stove is used, have a bed of glowing coals ready. If 
gas is used, have the gas broiler thoroughly heated. Grease 
the bars of the broiler. Place steak in the broiler and sear meat 
first on one side, then on the other. Continue to turn the 
broiler and cook the meat until it is brown and done according 
to taste. Steak an inch thick will take about ten minutes to 
be cooked to a medium degree. Chops are broiled in the same 
way. 

(2) Steak and chops may also be broiled in the pan. An 
iron frying pan is the best utensil. Heat the pan, and brush 
it over with a small piece of fat cut from the steak or the 
chops. The purpose of this is merely to keep the meat from 
stickij^ to the pan. The principle of procedure is the same as 
with (1). The steak or chops must be frequently turned, 
using a knife and a fork, being careful not to prick the meat 
with the fork. The length of time is slightly longer than^ 
for (1). This method must not be confused with the frying 
of steak in a pan with a large amount of*fat. By this method 
the steak is not fried, and it is often a convenient substitute 
for (1). 

2. Roast of beef . — Wipe roast with a damp cloth. Sprinkle with 

salt and dredge with flour. Place in a roasting pan, fat side 
up if it is a standing roast. Put the roast in a very hot 
oven and after fifteen minutes reduce the heat. Baste roast 
two or three times with the fat that tries out during cooking. 
The usual allowance of time for a medium rare roast is fifteen 
minutes for every pound of meat. 

Roast beef gravy. — After the roast has been taken from the 



MEATS AND POULTRY 223 

pan, pour out all but 1} tablespoonfuls of the melted fat. Stir 
in 1 heaping tablespoonful of flour and brown very slightly. 
Add one cup of cold water and stir constantly until thickened. 
Add i teaspoonful salt. Strain.

Wipe beef and cut the lean meat in inch cubes. Brown one 
third of the meat in fat cut from meat or marrow from a mar- 
row bone. Put remaining two thirds with bone and fat in 
soup kettle, add water and let stand for thirty minutes. Place 
on back of range, add browned meat, and heat gradually to 
the boiling point. Cover and cook slowly six hours, keeping 
below the boiling point during cooking. Add the vegetables 
and seasonings, cook one and one half hours, strain and cool as 
quickly as possible. This is caUed soup stock. 

To clarify houiUon. — When stock is cold, remove fat 
which has hardened on top and put quantity to be cleared into 
a stew pan. Allow white and shell of one egg to each quart of 
stock. Put over fire and stir constantly until boiling point 
is reached. Boil two minutes. Set back on stove and let 
simmer twenty minutes. Remove scum and strain through 
double thickness of cheesecloth. 

4. General directions for meat soups. — Soup making is an art that 
is well worth cultivating. The expert soup maker will obtain 
delicious flavors by adding bits of many kinds of left overs — 
almost anything that is found in the refrigerator in the way of 
fruit, vegetables, and pieces of meat. With the coming of the 
gas stove, many people have given up soup making. These 
various left overs add much to the flavor of the soup and 
can be used in a thickened soup which is like the bouillon 
strained and thickened. The thickening may be flour, arrow- 
root, cold cereal, sago, tapioca, or rice. Spaghetti, vermicelli, 



224 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



and fanoy forms of paste are sometimes served. Vegetables 
may be cut into dice or fancy shapes and served in the clear 
soup. A great variety is possible in flavofing and serving soup 
if one wiU take the trouble to make it an art. 

Soup meat may be served in a soup of the old-fashioned 
kind, thickened and containing vegetables. In such a soup some 
fat is left, and the total result is a dish that makes a meal when 
served with bread. 

When the soup is a clear soup, the meat that is left may be 
used for made over dishes; although some practical house- 
keex>ers think that it costs almost as much to make it palatable 
as to buy fresh meat. Try it in an escalloped dish with plenty 
of tomato, onion, and some dried herh^ for additional flavor.

browned, put in kettle, and rinse frying pan with boiling water, 
that none of the flavor may be lost. Cover with boiling water 
and boil five minutes, then cook below the boiling point until 
meat is tender (about 3 hours). Add vegetables except potatoes 
and seasoning the last hour of cooking. Parboil potatoes five 
minutes and add to stew 15 minutes before taking from fire. 



Teacher's Note. — Broiled steak would be suitable for group work, 
using small steaks (Delmonico cut). A small roast may be prepared by a 
group and roasted after class. This meat and that left from the steak should 
be used in a subsequent class for a lesson on left over meat. Broiled or 
pan-broiled chops may be prepared individually.

This is a simple method of serving left over meat that needs 
no specific recipe. Layers of bread crumbs are alternated with 
layers of meat which may be chopped or cut into small pieces. 
Liquid may be used like tomato or tomato juice, or soup that 
is left over, or plain water. The flavor may be varied by the 
use of the different materials that are suitable to meat. Layers 
of mashed potato may be used instead of bread. 

Poultry 

In selecting poultry see that the flesh is firm, that there is 
a good amount of fat underneath the skin, and that the skin 
is whole and a good yellow. Notice the odor of the fowl 
particularly. The skin of cold-storage poultry has not such 
a good color and is sometimes broken. Often the flesh is 
shrunken, and if the cold storage has been too long continued 
the odor is unpleasant. Refrigeration is allowable for a 
period. Another way to judge cold-storage 'poultry is by 



MEATS AND POULTRY 227 

the price. Well-fed poultry freshly killed brings a high 
market price and a bargain quite often proves to be poultry 
too long in cold storage. Good quaUty poultry is at present 
a high-priced food. 

To prepare poultry for cooking, the " dressing " of the 
chicken is often done now at the market. If it is necessary 
to do this at home, make an incision with a sharp knife just 
inside of one of the legs, in the groin. Insert the hand and 
remove all the entrails. The skin must be loosened at the 
neck and the crop removed. In any case, wash the chicken 
thoroughly inside and out, even holding the cavity under 
running water. If there is hair remaining on the chicken, 
singe this oflf over burning paper or over a gas flame. 

The composition is essentially the same as that of meat. 
The white of chicken, fowls, and turkeys is thought to be 
more digestible than the dark meat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The principles of cookery are the same as with the meat. Chicken 
soup is made on the same principle as beef soup. After straining, 
it is delicious with the addition of milk or cream. The meat of the 
chicken may be chopped iine and used as a thickening. Rice may 
be added or a hard-boiled egg chopped fine. 

Chicken may be served cold, for luncheon or supper, and is 
always very desirable in made-over dishes. Any stuffing left over 
may be used in the made dishes. 

I. Roast chicken. — Dress and clean a chicken. Fill the cavity with 
stuffing and sew edges together. Truss chicken and place on 
its back in a roasting pan. Rub surface with salt and spread 
breast and legs with butter. Dredge with flour. Put a little 
water in bottom of pan. Place in hot oven and when flour is 
well browned, reduce the temperature. Baste frequently during 
roasting with liquid in pan. When breast meat is tender and 
a brown crust formed the bird is cooked. A f our^pound chicken 
requires about J. } hours. 



228 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Stuffing, (See recipe for stuffing, page 237.) 

Mix all together. No moisture need be added as the 
juices of the chicken will be sufficient. 

Gravy, — Pour off liquid from pan in which chicken has 
been roasted. Add 2 tablespoonf uls of either chicken fat or 
butter. Stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and let bubble 
up. Add one cup stock, in which giblets, neck, and tips 
of wings have been cooked, and stir steadily until thick- 
ened. Add i teaspoonful salt. 

2. Chicken fricassee. — Clean and cut up a fowl. Cover with 
boiling water and let boil 5 minutes. Simmer until meat is 
tender. Remove chicken from kettle and place pieces in hot, 
greased frying pan. Saut^ until browned. Put on platter. 
Melt 4 tablespoonfuls chicken fat in pan. Add 4 tablespoon- 
fuls flour. Stir and let bubble up. Add 2 cups chicken 
stock, stir and let boil until thickened. Pour over chicken 
on platter. 

Preserved meats and poultry. — Smoked and salted meats 
are valuable foods, although the nutritive content is some- 
what less available for digestion. The salted and smoked 
mea^ts need long and slow cooking below the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

Canned meats and poultry of good quality are now in the 
market, and they are convenient and useful when not 
used to excess. Buy well-known brands. The govern- 
ment inspection of canned meats is of great importance, 
for the individual cannot protect himself. Canned soups 
are convenient for those who cook by gas and who live 
in small quarters. Buy good brands even if they are some- 
what more expensive. The best firms manufacturing canned 



Laboratory management. — A lesson on poultry is a very expensive one and 
difficult to manage so that each may have a share of the work. Such a lesson 
is suitable where the pupils have had work in previous years and are used to 
working in groups. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 229 

soup are scrupulously clean in their methods and pride 
themselves on using good material. 

Other parts of meat and poultry. — Some of the internal 
organs of the animals and fowl are used for food. Most 
of them are comparatively cheap, and may be made palat- 
able. 

The liver and kidneys are organs having to do with the waste 
products of the body and objection is raised to their use on that ac- 
count. If used, they should be soaked in cold salted water, put 
into fresh cold water, and allowed to heat very slowly. This 
water should be poured off, and then a brown stew can be made. 
What flavors are pleasant with liver and kidneys? 

Make your own recipe for hver or kidney stew. 

The heart does not contain waste products. Why is it tough? 
What process would you select to make it tender? Even when 
softened, it would not be attractive or very palatable without 
further treatment. It is hollow, somewhat as the chicken is before 
roasting. Look over the recipes and flavors suitable to .meat and 
see if you cannot make your own for Baked Heart. 

Sweetbreads t the pancreas, are highly prized on account of their 
deUcacy, and are costly. They may be broiled, or served in sauce

CHAPTER XIV 
FISH, SHELLFISH, AND OTHER MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Fish and shellfish are valuable assets as food, so much so 
that the govenunent has a Bureau of Fisheries, and has es- 
tablished stations at intervals on the coast and on inland 
lakes for the study and production of those foods that come 
from salt and fresh water. We have used these products of 
the waters as if the supply were limitless, forgetting that fish 
and shellfish are living creatures with hs^bits that we cannot 
ignore without working havoc to the species. Young salmon 
and shad are hatched in the upper reaches of the rivers, and 
if we insist on trapping the mature fish at the river mouth on 
their northern migrations, the number of young decreases, 
and salmon and shad become high-priced foods. To ignore 
fishery and game laws is an ignorant and dishonest proceed- 
ing, with far-reaching economic results. 

Varieties of fish. — In Bulletin No. 28 of the Office of 
Experiment Stations, United States Department of Agri- 
culture, forty-four different fish are listed, all used as food. 
A visit to the fish stall in the market of a seaboard city will 
acquaint you with many interesting species. Fresh and salt 
water fish differ in flavor, and there is a difference to be de- 
tected between fish from running, or from lake water, brook 
trout, for instance, having a superior flavor. The food supply 
also influences the flavor, and both fresh and salt water fish 
have a better flavor when taken from sandy and rocky 

bottoms rather than muddy. The habit of the fish also has 

231 



232 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



— Compositioii of fiah. 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 233 

an effect on the quality and taste. The chequit, for instance, 
is so sluggish and easy to catch that it is sometimes called 
*' lazy '' or *' weakfish," and it is watery and poor flavored 
compared with the shad, a fish of more vigorous habits. The 
amount of fat also causes a difference in flavor, such high 
flavored fish as salmon and shad containing much fat. The 
distinctive flavors of mackerel and herring are apparently not 
due to fat, since their fat content is not particularly highi 
Among the most conmion and best liked fish are bass, black- 
fish, bluefish, cod, flounder, haddock, halibut, herring, 
mackerel, porgy (sometimes called scup or scuppaug), 
salmon, shad, smelt, weakfish, whitefish. Brook trout and 
salmon trout are luxuries. 

Composition and nutritive value. — Figure 65 shows the 
composition of several kinds. Compare their composition 
with that of meat. The nutritive content is high, yet fish 
seems a lighter and less satisfying food than meat, although 
on the seaboard of some countries it is the chief animal food. 
The digestibility of fish and meat are about equal, but some 
varieties of fish are less digestible than others, this being 
true of the oily and strong-flavored fish, — herring, mackerel, 
salmon, and shad. 

There are popular prejudices for and against fish that are 
not warranted. The idea that fish is a " brain food " be- 
cause it contains phosphorus was exploded long since, for 
fish contains no more phosphorus than some other foods, 
and phosphorus is no more valuable to the brain than to the 
other tissues. 

Fish, however, is valuable in the dietary for supplying 
protein and giving variety, and in season, it is one of the 
cheaper foods. 

Quality of fish. — Fish deteriorates and decomposes much 
more rapidly than meat, and is at its best when cleaned and 



234 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cooked just after being caught. Ice will preserve fish for a 
short time only. If ever on a camping trip you have eaten 
bluefish caught in the surf, or trout from the brook, cooked 

■ 

immediately, you know what flavor a fish may have. Fish 
should be killed immediately, and put on ice if they are 
not to be cooked at once. If there is no ice, clean the fish, 
sprinkle the flesh with pepper and salt, wrap in a wet cloth, 
and set in a breeze or draught. 

When fish are transported over long distances they should be 
packed in ice in refrigerator cars, and you will notice that the 
fishman in the shop keeps the fish on ice until he sells 
them. 

In selecting fish, see that the flesh feels firm and that the 
eyes are still bright. If you have a keen sense of smell, 
this will also guide you, although to the novice the odor of 
fish may be disagreeable even if untainted. 

Fish in season and caught plentifully near by, are of good 
quality and should be cheap. Shad and salmon have their 
season in the spring, bluefish come north in the simimer, 
sometimes as late as August, porgies are a summer and au- 
tmnn fish, alid smelt are abundant in the winter. Deep- 
sea fish like cod and halibut have a long season, and may be 
bought at any time. 



GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The scaling and cleaning of fish are important first steps. In the 
city this may be done for you at the market, but sometimes on 
fishing expeditions when you are not a successful fisher you may 
make yourself useful by cleaning the fish. Clean the fish on a 
large piece of paper. Use a sharp strong knife, and rub oflf the 
scales from the tail to the head. To skin a fish well, you should 
first watch an expert. Cut through the skin of the back and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 235 

abdomen, loosen it at the tail and pull it off. Remove the head, 
open the abdomen, and take out the entrails. Bum the paper 
on which the fish has been cleaned. Fish is boned by slitting the 
flesh down the back, and patiently separating the flesh from the 
side bones, and finally pulling out the spine and attached bones. 
The strong odor of fish clings to everything the fish touches. Wash 
the fish, the knife, and your own hands in cold water and salt. 
Always pour the water in which fish is washed or cooked down the 
sink at once, pour in some salt, an'd flush the trap with cold water. 
The utensils, and dishes in which fish is served, need very careful 
washing in several waters. 

The connective tissue of fish softens and dissolves more readily 
than does that of meat. Fish varies in the dryness of the flesh, but 
there is no such thing as tough flsh, and the texture of the muscles 
is about the same in all parts of the fish, although there is a differ- 
ence in flavor in the dark and white flesh when these both occur. 
On account of this characteristic of the connective tissue the fish 
" falls apart " and our aim must be to prevent this. 



Principles of cool 

1. The protein is affected as in all other foods where it occurs. 

2. The fat is melted. 

3. Connective tissue quickly softened. 

To avoid the breaking of the fish it may be wrapped in cloth for 
boiling, and the water should simmer only. The coating of small 
fish or slices of large fish with beaten egg and crumbs tends to hold 
it together. In all cases avoid overcooking. Fish is done when 
a fork easily pierces it and separates the flakes of flesh from the 
bone. 

I. Boiled fish. — Use thick pieces of large fish for boiling, or 
if small fish are used they may be boiled whole. Add salt and 
vinegar to water in proportion of 1 tablespoonful of salt and 
two of vinegar to three quarts of water. Use enough water 
to cover the fish. Wrap the fish in cheesecloth to prevent 
breaking apart, and plunge into boiling water. Do not let 
the water boil after fish is in. The fish is done when the flesh 
leaves the bone or when the flesh flakes apart easily. The usual 
time- for a thick piece is 30-40 minutes.

Make as for white sauce, adding the beaten eggs just before 
taking from fire and stirring until well thickened. Add lemon 
juice just before serving. This sauce is suitable for boiled fish and 
vegetables. 

2. Left over fish. — Fish may be picked apart, mixed with cream 

sauce, and served as creamed fish or served as an escallop. 

Escalloped fish. 

2 cups left over fish, picked over and freed of bones. 
1 cup thin white sauce, dried bread crumbs buttered. 

Butter a baking dish and line with crumbs. Add a layer 
• of fish, using half, and cover with half the sauce. Cover with 
a layer of crumbs. Add another layer of fish, sauce, and 
crumbs, making this last layer of crumbs quite thick. Place 
in a hot oven and leave until crumbs are brown and fish is 
heated through. 

To butter crumbs. 

Melt a little butter in a saucepan and turn the crumbs 
in, stirring them over and over with a spoon until all the 
crumbs are coated. 

3. Baked fish. — Almost any medium sized fish is suitable for bak- 

ing. The favorites are bluefish, shad, haddock, and halibut, 
sliced. 

Clean the fish, seeing that aU scales are removed. Stuff and 
sew. Shape with skewers to form a letter S and place upright on • 
a baking pan or lay fish on side. If the fish is not a fat kind, put 
strips of salt pork over it and in pan or cut gashes in fish and 
lay strips of pork in them. Dredge with flour. Bake one 
hour for a three-pound fish, in a hot oven, basting frequently 
with the tried-out fat. Serve with drawn butter or Hollandaise 
sauce.

4. Creamed codfish. — Soak the fish in cold water, and pull it apart 

with knife and fork. Put it in a saucepan of cold water, 
allow the water to heat slowly, and stop the heating just 
before the water reaches the boiling point. Pour off the water, 
• shake the saucepan over the fire, add a thin white sauce, No. 2, 
and reheat. Serve on toast if desired. 

5. Codfish balls or cakes. 

Ingredients. 

Codfish, picked 1 cup 

Potatoes, cut in cubes 2 cups 

Egg 1 

Salt, if needed to taste 

Flour for dredging 
Method, 

Put the fish and potatoes in a stewpan, cover with cold 
water, bring the water to the boiling point, and cook imtil 
the potato is tender. The whole process wiU take about 20 
minutes. Drain off the water very thoroughly and shake the 
stewpan over the fire to dry the contents. It is very neces- 
sary to have the mixture free from water. Mash and heat 
the mixture in the stewpan, and add the egg. Taste to see 
if more salt is needed, as is sometimes the case. Finish as 
follows : 

(a) Shape into round fiat cakes about an inch thick, dredge 
with fiour and saut^. 



Laboratory maruigement. — For individual work or work in groups of two, 
small fish, as perch, may be procured and these may be stuffed and baked 
in the period. 



238 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(b) The same, browning the cakes on a greased pan in the 
oven, or under the gas flame, turning if necessary. ' 

(c) Shape in balls, place these in a wire frying basket, lower 
the basket into hot fat'imtil the baUs brown, lift the basket, 
drain, and drain the balls on paper. Keep hot imtil it is time 
to serve. 

Shellfish 

The shellfish are of two classes ; the moUusks including 
clams, mussels (seldom used in this country), oysters, and 
scallops, and the crustaceans, — lobsters and crabs. None 
of the moUusks have high nutritive value, but they are a 
protein food, and add to the variety of the diet. The com- 
position of the oyster is shown in Fig. 65, and it will be noted 
that the fat percentage is small and the calorie value low. 

The oyster is raised in beds in the ocean, or bays often near 
the river mouth, and it is the neighborhood to the river that 
makes it possible*for the oyster to carry germs of contagion, 
particularly of typhoid fever, when city sewage poured into 
the river passes over the oyster bed. Here, too, government 
protection is essential, and this is a matter that has created 
so much excitement that conditions are already improved. 
There is an association of oyster growers who make a point 
of advertising clean oyster beds, and cleanly methods of 
handling and transporting. 

Oysters vary in size and flavor, the flavor seeming to de- 
pend upon the locality. The smaller are sought for serving 
raw, and the medium and larger for cooking. They are sold 
by the measure or nimiber when taken from the shell, the 
latter giving the surer quantity ; and the price is usually one 
cent apiece. They are in season from September to May. 
The whole flesh of the oyster is soft and edible, even the 
muscle by which it opens and shuts its shell being tender. 

Clams are of two kinds, distinguished differently in differ- 
ent places. They are known as hard and soft, or roimd and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 239 

long, and in Rhode Island the hard round clam still bears the 
Indian name Quahaug, the soft shell clam being the only 
" clam/' 

The long clam lies buried in the soft mud of creeks and 
muddy shores left exposed at low tide, when they are dug by 
hoes from the mud. The round clam lies on the bottom of 
shallow warm waters, and is raked with an implement made 
for the purpose. The round clam is used when very yoimg 
and small in place of raw oysters; but both kinds when 
matured have a tough portion that is not softened in cooking, 
and that is more or less indigestible. The long " neck " 
which protrudes from the shell has to be discarded. 

Both kinds may be roasted in the shell, and are very palat- 
able served hot with melted butter, salt, and pepper. They 
are most conmionly used in soups and in chowder. They are 
purchased by the quantity or number, are cheaper than oys- 
ters, and are always in season. 

Scallops, as purchased, are only a part of the animal in the 
shell, consisting solely of the round white muscle which op- 
erates the shell. The escallop, or scallop, is migratory, mov- 
ing by a shooting motion, the mature scallops reaching the 
creeks and shores in the autumn, and though found in so- 
called beds they are not fixtures like the oysters. The flavor 
is sweet, and they have a quality that makes them more or 
less indigestible, especially when fried. They are very 
palatable and more digestible served in a stew made like an 
oyster stew. They are sold by the measure and are cheap 
in season. 

The lobster is now a luxury, for methods of catching in the 
past have m'ade them scarce in their old haunts. The lobster 
is a much more highly developed animal than the moUusk, 
having strong muscles inside its coat of mail, and the flesh 
has a protein content that compares very favorably with 



240 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

meat. When fresh, and not served with rich sauces or eaten 
at irregular hours, it is not especially indigestible, and may 
be the main* dish at luncheon or supper, served simply with 
salt, pepper, and melted butter and not taken with meat 
foods. Its own delicious flavor needs no addition in the way 
of sauces and high seasoning. 

The crab is essentially like the lobster, being smaller, and 
having a sweeter flavor. The soft shell crab is caught just 
as the old shell is shed, and is highly esteemed as a delicacy. 
Both lobsters and crabs are cooked in the shell, and if al- 
lowed to die naturally before cooking they are uneatable. 
They may be purchased alive or cooked, and one is surer of 
their condition when they are bought alive. Twenty-five 
cents a pound is now an average price for lobsters in shell. 
Crabs are somewhat less expensive at times, but soft shells 
are always high-priced. 

The following table shows the food value of a few of this 
group in terms of the weight of the 100-Calorie portion.

Preserved fish and shellfish. — Smoking and salting are 
two old-time methods that are still in use, and smoked salmon, 
herring, and finnan haddie furnish us well-flavored foods at 
a reasonable price. Small smoked herring are eaten un- 
cooked, and the other two kinds are excellent broiled, or 
parboiled and finished in the oven. Salt cod should not be 
despised, for it is convenient and may be made palatable. 
Like the meats, the fish preserved by these methods are 
slightly less available for digestion. 

Preserving in ail is made familiar to us by the sardine of 
Italy in olive oil and the small herring of America in cotton- 
seed oil, which also bears the name of sardine. The latter 
is less delicate in flavor than the European sardine, but is of 
course cheaper, and is palatable and of equal food value. 

Canned fish and shellfish are used in localities where fresh 
fish are not easily available, and should not be unwholesome 
if the process is properly inspected. Canned salmon is the 
most common, and makes an excellent luncheon dish when 
well prepared (see chapter on salads). 



242 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Principles of cooking. — The protein in all of these is the 

chief consideration. The oyster is more delicate when cooked 

just below the boiling point of water for a brief period only. 

This is also true of the clam, except the tough membranes 

which must be chopped. The flesh of both lobster and 

clam is toughened by cooking, and the process should be 

short. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. — All fish and shellfish should be thoroughly 
cleansed in cold water before using, and imder running water when 
possible. Wash oysters, clams, and scallops in a colander or 
strainer imder the faucet. If the oyster or clam liquor is used, 
put it through a fine strainer. 

I. To serve oysters and small clams raw. — Arrange on finely 
chopped ice on a plate, with a piece of lemon in the center. 
Cut a section of lemon, not a slice. Horse-radish is sometimes 
served with the raw oyster. Garnish with parsley if you wish. 

a. Creamed oysters. — Clean oysters of aU pieces of shell. Cook 
them below the boiling point for a few minutes until plump 
and edges begin to curl. Drain and add to white sauce sea- 
soned with celery salt. Serve on toast, in bread cases, or patty 
shells. 

3. Sauted oysters. — Clean one pint of oysters, sprinkle on both 
sides with salt and pepper. Lift by the tough muscle with 
a fork and dip on both sides in crackJBr crumbs and saut^ in 
butter until well browned on both sides.

Clean and pick over olams, separate the hard and soft part 
of clams and chop the former. Strain clam liquor through 
cheesecloth. Try out the pork and fry the onion in it until 
brown and turn into a large kettle. Boil potatoes imtil tender, 
drain, and pour potatoes into kettle. Add clams, milk, butter, 
and crackers broken into smaU pieces. Let cook three minutes. 
Just before serving add clam liquor previously heated. Serve 
in bowls. 

5. To prepare lobster and crabs for serving. — Make ready a large 
kettle of rapidly boiling water. Wrap a piece of paper around 
the lobster or crab, and plunge it head downward into the boil- 
ing water. Let the water boil gently for 20 minutes — longer 
if the lobsters are very large. 

To open, a strong pair of scissors is the best utensil and some- 
times a hammer is necessary for the heavy claws. Pull out 
the flesh, keeping it as whole as possible, The stomach of the 
lobster and crab should be taken out and can be recognized 
near the h^ad. The long intestine should also be removed 
and is easy to find in the hinderpart by splitting open this part 
and removing a long white string. The soft green portion 
is the liver and is eatable. 

To serve. — (a) Pick apart and serve on lettuce with a 
French dressing, or (6) Serve hot with melted butter. 

Meat Substitutes 

Among these, beans, peas, lentils, eggs, milk, and cheese 
have already been mentioned. Fish is classed also as a meat 
substitute. 

Nuts. — These are a valuable meat substitute, some of 
them having a good protein content, and a high fat content 
as well. (See Fig. 66.) They may be served raw for dessert, 
with some fruit either fresh or dried, raisins and nuts being a 
pleasing combination. They should be thoroughly masti- 
cated. They are also palatable and possibly more digestible 
when cooked. The reason that many people consider nuts 
indigestible is because they eat them between meals, and do 
not give them a proper place in a meal, eating them when

enough food of other kinds has been taken. One who is 
open-minded in the matter of menus will find that nuts, raw 
or cooked, can literally take the place of meat in a meal. 

Almonds are always available in the markets and are so rich in 
protein and fat that a pound of shelled almonds is equivalent in 
food value to about three pounds of steak. At usual prices a good 
grade of almonds is more economical than the ordinary cuts of meat. 

Chestnuts are a staple food in parts of Italy, and have a dehcious 
flavor in soups, stuffings, and sauces. Oiu" own native chestnuts, 
boiled and served whole or roasted, make an excellent simple dessert. 

Hickory nuts, English walnuts, pecan nuts, and filberts are not 
only palatable in muffins, cake, and yeast bread, but add to the 
food value in a rational way. 

Peanuts are rich in oil and protein. They are nearly equal to 
almonds in food value and are even more economical. Peanuts 
are too concentrated a food for eating between meals or to be taken 
after a meal already sufficient, but they may take the place of meat in 
the meal and peanut butter may be used on bread and in sandwiches 
without butter. They, too, may be used with cake and cookies. 

Chopped nuts may be served with a variety of desserts. Remem- 
ber always that they are to be considered food.

Teacher's Note. — When time permits and circumstances make desir- 
able the development of the economic phase of the food work, students 
maybe directed to look up the composition, or the food value per ounce or per 
pound, of a variety of the foods of whatever group is under study and work 
out the return in food value for a given expenditure of money. The tables 
in Rose's "Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics*' will be found especially 
useful in such work.

CHAPTER XV 
SALADS AND DESSERTS 

Salads and desserts are sometimes looked upon as luxuries, 
and something to be omitted where people must exercise 
strict economy, and as more or less indigestible forms of food 
to be avoided. As a matter of fact both of these types of 
dishes are extremely valuable in giving variety to the diet. 
They may be very inexpensive, and when they have the 
right relation to the rest of the meal, are not more indigestible 
than many other forms of food. A heavy salad or rich dessert 
eaten after a sufficient amount of other food will naturally 
cause digestive disturbance. 

To disprove the theory of great cost of desserts, two 
friends once had an amusing contest to see which could serve 
the largest number of palatable desserts at the lowest price. 
It was interesting to see how many could be made for a cost 
of from six to ten cents for a family of five. 

Matei^als used for salad. — The word *' salad " is said to 
be derived from the Latin " salis " (salt) which implies that 
the salad has been looked upon more or less as a relish. We 
all associate with a salad appetizing crispness and freshness. 
The materials used in the modem salad are so varied that a 
complete list would include nearly all our fruits and vege- 
tables and meat foods.

Cooked vegetables. — Beans, string and whole, beets, canKflower, 
carrots, potatoes, and spinach. 

Fruits uncooked, — Any fresh fruit, possibly with the exception of 
some of the berries. 

Meat and poultry. — The white meats like veal, chicken, and 
turkey are more attractive in salad, but any kind of cold meat may 
be used. 

Fish and shellfish. — Lobsters, crabs, scallops, and cold fish. 

Nuts. — Several kinds may be used in combination with fruit. 

Jellies. — Tomato jelly, meat, chicken, and fish molded in 
jelly, may be served as a salad. 

Eggs. — Hard-boiled eggs are used as a garnish. 

Cream cheese. — May be served with lettuce. 

Salad dressings. — Plain lettuce or celery served with salt 
is in a sense a salad, but it is our custom to dress the lettuce 
with a mixture which contains an acid and usually an oil. 
A very simple, old-fashioned form of dressing used in this 
country is vinegar and sugar. Substitute lemon juice or 
fresh lime juice for the vinegar and you will have a very 
refreshing and simple salad for a summer day. 

The ordinary dressing consists of vinegar or lemon juice, 
and oil; another form is mayonnaise, where the yolk and 
sometimes the white of egg are used to hold the oil and vine- 
gar together. 

Another form is a cooked dressing which may be bottled 
and kept for a longer time than the French dressing or the 
mayonnaise. 

OlitiiB oil. -^ This is the most delicious oil for salad dressing when the 
flavor is liked and when it can be afforded. 

Cottonseed and corn oil. — There are now in the market clarified 
cottonseed oil and com oil that may be used in mayonnaise dress- 
ing, and the flavor is not unacceptable, and certainly superior 
to the poorer grades of olive oil which quite likely contain one of 
these oils as an adulterant. Cottonseed oil makes a better substi- 
tute for olive oil then does com oil as it is at present refined. 



SALADS AND DESSERTS 249 

Butter. — Butter may be used in boiled salad dressing for tbose 
vho dislike the flavor of the oils. 

The acids in dressing. — These may be either vin^ar or lemon juioe, 
aad many people with whom the vin^ar disagrees can eat a salad 
made with lemon jiiiee. The acid shoiild not be used in excess 
in any caee; the best dressings do not give a distinctively B«id 
taste. 

AdjuncU. — Salt, mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika. 

GENERAL METHODS AHD RECIPES 

Genend directions. — The two important points in the prep- 
aration ol the material for salad are, first, that everything should

bethoroughly dry, and, second, thoroughly chilled. The importance 
of these two points cannot be overemphasized, and they are of 
equal value in salad making. Many a salad is unpalatable because 
it is watery and wilted. For the preparation of green v^etables 
see Chapter VII. Vegetables should be cut in cubes or sometimes 
in slices. Meat, poultry, and shellfish should be cut in small pieces 
or chopped. The prepared meat should be mixed with some of 



250 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the oil uid acid and allowed to atand in an ice box for some time 
before it is dressed and arran^d for serving. This prooees is called 
marinating in the cookbooks, and gives a flavor to the salad that 
it cannot have if a dresBing is poured over the meat just before 
aerving. 

ComUnationB in salad. — Several well-known combinations 
will at once occur to you. Meat salads usually have a mixture 
of celery. SevertiJ. vegetables may be used together, as beans and 
carrots, or carrotB, poaa, and string beans with lettuce. Apples, 
nuts, and celery make a pleasing combination. Indeed there would 
seem to be no end to the possibilities here. 

Sernng and garnishing. — The principle here is to make the 
dish attractive with as little labor as possible. Everything served

as a garnish should be eatable. A bed of crisp dry lettuce leaves 
is the most attractive setting for any salad. When this is not 
procurable, cresa makes an attractive border to a salad. Figure 
68 shows you a salmon jelly molded in a ring and attractively 
served in lettuce. Figure 67 shows a cucumber placed on lettuce 
leaves, dressed with a French dressing and sprinkled with chopped 
peppers. The cucumber is sliced ready to serve ; the slices being cut 
not entirely through the cucumber. This is rapidly prepared and

is most attractive. When the salad is arranged in its dish, it should 
be put in the ice box and allowed to remain until it is time to take 
it to the table. The salad is sometimes served on individual 
plates. 

I. French dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Salt } teasi)oonful 

Pepper i teaspoonful . 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 4 tablespoonfuls 

Method, 

Mix the salt, pepper, and vinegar and stir in the olive oil 
slowly. A few drops of onion juice may be added. 

a. Mayonnaise dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Mustard 1 teaspoonful 

Salt 1 teaspoonful 

Powdered sugar 1 teaspoonful 
A few grains of cayenne 

Eggs Yolks of 2 

Lemon juice 2 tablespoonfuls 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 1} cups 

Method. 

Stir together the eggs, mustard, salt, pepper, and sugar. 
Add the oil, a drop at a time, stirring and beating constantly. 
The back of a silver fork is a good thing for mixing mayonnaise, 
though some people prefer a Dover beater. As the dressing be- 
comes very thick it should be thinned occasionally with vinegar 
and lemon, alternately, but never let it lose its consistency. 
After the first, the oil may be added more rapidly. AU ingre- 
dients and utensils must be cold. If the weather is warm, the 
bowl should be surrounded with ice water. If the dressing should 
separate, begin with another yolk of egg and stir the separated 
mixture into it slowly, as before. Set the bowl in a cold 
place and it should keep for many days.

3. Boiled dressing. 

Ingredients, 

Eggs 2 

Mustard i teaspoonful 

Salt } tablespoonful 

Sugar i tablespoonful 

Vinegar 3 tablespoonfuls

Butter 1 tablespoonful 

A few grains of cayenne 
Method. 

Mix the dry ingredients and beat with the eggs until light. 
Add the vinegar and water and cook in a double boiler, stirring 
constantly until thick and smooth. Remove from the fire, stir 
in the butter and set away to cool. A little cream added after the 
dressing cools is a great addition. Sour cream may be used instead 
of the water, in which case less vinegar and butter should be used. 

4. Potato salad. 

Ingredients. 

Potatoes, cold boiled or baked 

Parsley or onion juice 

Egg, hard boiled, olives, pickled beets, etc. 

French dressing 
Method. 

Cut the cold-boiled or baked potatoes into §-inch cubes. 

Marinate (i. e. mix and let stand ) with French dressing. Chopped 

parsley or onion juice may be mixed with potatoes. Arrange 

in a mound and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg, olives, 

pickled beets, etc. 

5. Chicken salad. 

Ingredients. 

Cold-boiled or roast fowl 

Celery, } as much as fowl 

French dressing 

Mayonnaise or boiled dressing 

Olives 
Method. 

Cut cold-boiled or roast fowl in i-inch cubes. Add to this 

} as much celery which has been washed, scraped, and out into 



SALADS AND DESSERTS 263 

cubes. Marinate with French dressing. Just before serving 
moisten with mayonnaise or boiled salad dressing. Garnish 
with celery tips and olives. 

6. Waldorf salad. 

Ingredients. 

Apples, tart and juicy 

Celery, i as much as apples 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce leaves 
Method, 

Select tart, juicy apples. Cut in quarters, pare and core 

and cut in }-inch cubes. Add half as much celery, washed, 

scraped, and cut into cubes. Mix with boiled or mayonnaise 

dressing and serve cold on lettuce leaves. If handsome red 

apples can be had, they may be washed and polished and a 

slice cut from the stem end and the apple used as a cup after 

scooping out the inside to use for a filling with the celery. Serve 

on a lettuce leaf. Chopped nuts may be mixed with the apple 

and celery if desired. 

7. Stuffed tomato salad. 

Ingredients, 

Tomatoes, medium sized 

Boiling water 

Salt 

Cucumbers (or celery) 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce leaves 
Method, 

Cover medium sized tomatoes with boiling water for a min- 
ute and remove the skin. Cut a thin slice from the top and 
take out part of the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle inside of the 
tomato with salt, invert, and let stand one half hour. Fill 
tomatoes with cucumbers (or celery) cut in small cubes and 
moistened with mayonnaise dressing. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and garnish top with mayonnaise dressing. 



LdborciUyriMnanagement. — J egg yolk (1 teaspoonful) and i cup of olive 
oil is as small a quantity as is practicable to use in making the mayonnaise. 
This quantity made by groups of two works out well as the process of adding 
the oil drop by drop is difficult for a beginner working alone. The boiled 
dressing works in well as a variation of the boiled custard.

Desserts 

The dessert in this country includes the sweet dish, or the 
fruit at the end of the meal. In simple meals the dessert is 
usually one of the two, although in more elaborate meals 
fruit is served after the sweet dish, and sometimes crackers 
and cheese are served at the last. From the point of view 
of nutrition and digestibility this is more than is necessary, 
and you will notice that when both are served, the fruit is 
often declined. Like the salad, the dessert may be made 
from a large variety of materials and bears different names. 
There are hot puddings and cold puddings, pies and tarts, 
jellies and ices and ice creams. It is very interesting to read 
over the many dishes of this class in a cookbook and to attempt 
to classify them. If you are fortunate enough to have access 
to a cookbook of the eighteenth century, you will find 
that much labor was given to the preparation of elaborate 
structures which served as table ornaments ; even now you 
will find French cooks who spend much time in making 
elaborate displays of their skill. For everyday life the 
dessert should be attractive to the eye and yet simple. 

Materials used in desserts. 

Eggs, milk, and cream; these are important and are used in cus- 
tards, in dishes stiffened with gelatin or thickened with cornstarch, 
or in ice cream. 

Breadsiuffs. — Cake and sponge cake, bread crumbs and sliced 
bread, are valuable in desserts. Bread pudding may be made a 
very delicious dish. Bread may be combined with fruit in the shape 
of an escalloped dish. Baking powder biscuits, crust, and short- 
cake are also used. 

Other starchy substances. — These are cornstarch, arrowroot, 
sago, tapioca and manioca. 

Fruits. — Raw and cooked fruits of every possible kind. A few 
fruits like the lemon, orange, grapefruit, and melon are not cooked. 
For preparing fruit served alone, see Chapter VI. 



SALADS AND DESSERTS 255 

Oelatitt. — This material haa been mentioned in the chapter on 
meat. It ia prepared for use in desserts in a number of forms, the 
granular beins the most convenient. Oelatiu has the property, 
first, uf absorbing water, then of dissolving at the boiling tempera- 
ture of water and becoming stiS again when oool. After dissolving, 
as it is eooliog and just as it begins to thicken slightly, it can be 
. beaten like white of e^. If beating is attempted while the liquid is 
warm, or again if it becomes too stiS, the result is not successful. 
This property makes it useful in the sponges and other fancy 
desserts where the light spongy texture is desirable.

Whipping the cream and putting it around the base takes 
only a few minutes. As in salad, the garnish should be eat- 
able and easily prepared. 

z. Boiled custard. 

Ingredients. 

Milk 1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Eggs 3 

Vanilla i teaspoonful 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Method, 

Put the milk, sugar, and salt in a double boiler to scald. Sepa- 
rate the eggs and set the whites in a cold place until wanted. 
Beat the yolks until lemon-^solored. Pour a little of the scalded 
milk on the yolks of the eggs, stirring until well mixed. Set the 
double'boiler back on the stove and pour the egg and milk mixture 
slowly into the rest of the scalded milk, stirring constantly until 
thickened enough to coat the spoon. Remove from the fire, add 
the flavoring, and turn into a dish to cool. Just before serving 
beat the whites to a very stiff froth and pile by spoonfuls on the 
custard. The whites may be sweetened with powdered sugar 
after beating if desired. Com starch may be used, and fewer eggs. 

2. Baked custard. 

Ingredients. 

Milk .1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Eggs 2 

Lemon or 

Vanilla i teaspoonful 

Method. 

Scald the milk, sugar, and salt together. Beat the eggs in .a 
baking dish and pour the scalded milk over them. Add the 
flavoring and stir well. Set the baking dish in a pan of boil- 
ing water and bake in a moderate oven until a knife thrust into 
the custard will come out clean. Serve cold either plain, or with 
chocolate sauce. Nutmeg may be grated on top of the custard 
before baking, or caramel flavoring may be added in place of 
the vanilla.

crush with a spoon. When the shortcake is done remove from 
the pan, cut around the edge with a sharp knife and right through 
the center of the cake, making two layers of it. Spread the lower 
layer with butter and then with the crushed strawberry. Replace 
the top layer and serve hot. Fresh peaches, preserves, or a 
mixture of orange and banana may be used for this shortcake,

the beaten whites, and continue to beat lightly until quite 
stiff. Pile by spoonfuls on a plate and serve with boiled cus- 
tard, or mold as in Fig. 69. 

Frozen mixtures. — There are some interesting principles 
to note here. The freezing is accomplished by using a mix- 
ture of chopped ice and rock salt. Can you explain how this 
reduces the temperature? 

Another interesting point is this : Have you ever seen a 
milk bottle on a cold winter morning with the paper cover or 
even the metal cap pushed up, the frozen milk standing high 
above the top of the bottle ? What does this suggest to you 
in connection with the filling of the ice cream freezer? 

It must be noted, too, that a larger amount of flavoring 
material is needed in a frozen dessert than in one that is not. 
The frozen custard, for instance, needs more vanilla than one 
prepared in the ordinary manner. Can you account for this ? 

Method of freezing. 

There are many patterns of ice cream freezers that are well 
constructed and inexi)ensive. They are sold by the size, a 2 quart 



262 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

freezer giving you 2 quarts of the frozen cream. See that the crank 
is oiled and the whole apparatus clean. Have ready pounded ice 
and rock salt, usually in the proportion of 1 part salt to 3 of ice. 
Machines come for cutting the ice, but it is easy to pound it in a 
strong bag. Set the freezer can in place, put around it the ice and 
salt alternately, shaking down and packing firmly. Have the ice 
cream mixture cool, x)our it in, having the can not more than } full. 
Put on the lid, cover with ice and salt, and begin to turn the 
crank. Open and stir down once or twice, being careful to keep 
out the salt. Take out the crank before the cream is too stiff. Pack 
the cream firmly down in the can. See that the melted water is 
removed from the pail, put in more ice and salt, and leave until the 
ice cream is firm.

CHAPTER XVI 
PREPARATION OF MEALS AND TABLE SERVICE 

The preparation of a number of dishes assembled for a 
meal requires a skill quite different from that necessary for 
the making of a single dish. A menu being decided upon, 
it needs an accurate sense of time, forethought, and prompt- 
ness, to have a number of dishes ready at the same time, or 
in proper sequence if several courses are served. Such 
questions as the following must be answered : 

Technique of preparation, 

1. What steps in preparation can be taken ahead of time, as 
washing, paring, cutting, etc. ? 

2. What dishes take the longest to cook? 

3. Which must be served the moment they are done ? 

4. Which can be kept hot for some time without injury ? 

5. Which can be finished and cooled perhaps several hours 
before ? 

6. Do the dishes selected require the same utensils at the same 
time? (If so, the menus must be changed.) 

7. What is the order of serving ? 

To understand the bearing of these questions you will need 
to select some menu and make a plan for preparing it. (See 
exercises at the end of this chapter.) 

The fact is obvious that in preparing a meal you cannot 

finish the dishes one at a time, but that steps individual to 

each dish must be interwoven with each other, and the cook 

must have them all " on her mind," and is often doing half 

a dozen things at once. As a high school girl, preparing a 

265 



266 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

part of her first meal, remarked, " This is as good training as 
mathematics." 

The woman at home will devise many ways of easing and 
shortening the labor just before the meal is served, avoiding 
haste and anxiety in this way. With the fireless cooker and 
other slow-cooking apparatus, the heavy work may sometimes 
be done far ahead of mealtime. A dessert can be prepared 
and be cooking as breakfast dishes are washed, and at the 
time left overs are put away they can be arranged ready for 
serving, as in the case of poultry or meat to be served cold. 
While the preparation of the midday meal is in progress, 
something can sometimes be done for the last meal, too. 
This, indeed, is a field for generalship, and it is a successful 
campaign when the meals are all on time and well prepared, 
and the cook and family cheerful. 

Important points in serving each dish. — Each dish should 
be perfectly done, neither over nor under cooked. All hot 
dishes should be hot, and cold dishes cold. Lukewarm food 
is not agreeable. Bread and cake and some kinds of pastry 
are the only foods that may have the temperature of the 
room. Sliced meat and salads should be cold. Chill choc- 
olate Eclairs before serving and see how much they are im- 
proved ; indeed, experiment with a number of foods that are 
usually served at room temperature. 

To keep food hot. — A hot closet above a coal or gas range is 
made for this purpose, and steam heaters sometimes have hot 
closets. A double boiler is a help, and one utensil may be set into 
a larger, filled with boiling water. Some dishes can be set back on 
the stove, or over a simmering gas burner with an asbestos mat 
underneath. The oven may be used sometimes, with the door set 
ajar. The food may be kept covered unless it will steam, in 
which case cover it with a towel. Serve food in hot dishes. 

To keep food cool. — Leave the dish in the ice box until the last 
possible moment. Sometimes serve with iee (butter in warm

* 

weather). If ice is lacking, use other cooling devices. Serve in 
chilled dishes. 

Garnishing the dish. — All food must be neatly placed in the 
dish, and arranged or piled with some sort of symmetry, and this is 
the most that some people have time to do. Many foods may be 
served in the utensil or dish in which they are cooked, and in the 
case of a baking dish, if its appearance is not neat, a napkin can 
be folded about it. The simplest form of garnish is browning on 
the top, which makes many dishes attractive (mashed potato). 

Make the garnishing simple, and have it eatable when x)ossible. 
Slices of hard boiled eggs on spinach, chopped parsley and butter 
on boiled or mashed potato, parsley and slices of lemon, with meat 
and fish. 

Vegetable borders are attractive and save labor in dish washing! 
Arrange the meat in the center of the platter, and pile mashed po- 
tato, or boiled rice or peas or beans, or a mixture of hot vegetables 
around the edge. This saves time in table service, too. 

The garnishing of salads, desserts, and cakes is treated in pre- 
vious chapters. 

Table equipment and service. — This is a place where 
beauty is a large element, and most people understand the 
charm of a daintily laid table, as the family gathers for a 
meal. But many factors must be taken into account, for 
it is an easy matter to pass from the simple and beautiful 
to an extravagant display, to spend more on the dining-room 
equipment than the income warrants, and to waste much 
energy in unnecessary work. Our great need here is to learn 
to see beauty in simpUcity. We must remember, too, that 
many people in our country live in crowded quarters, and have 
no time for anything but the simplest kind of table service.^ 

The table should be firm, large enough to accommodate the family 
comfortably, and it should permit of extension when occasion de- 
mands a larger board. The top should have an oil finish that will 
not easily mar and that can be washed off. Have a thick cloth or 
pad to protect it — the "silence cloth." 

* For Furnishing the Dining Room, see "Shelter and Clothing," p. 88.

Table covers may be the small doilies with centerpiece, strips 
of fine linen crash, or blue or brown and white Japanese toweling 
laid across both ways, a cloth that just covers the table, or a large 
cloth that hangs well below the table edge. The doilies and strips 
are used conventionally for breakfast and dinner, but save much 
labor when used for all meals. The color may be white, or tinted, 
but the dark-KK)lored cloth should be banished. 

The material may be linen or mercerized cotton. Many people 
think white table oilcloth is impossible, but a table covered with 
it may be made very pretty ; it can be kept clean by washing at 
the end of each meal, and the saving in labor is incalculable. 

The pattern and quality and cost of table linens are mentioned 
in Chapter XXI. 

Napkins may match the tablecloths. A small size economizes 
labor. Avoid fringes, selecting a scalloped edge or hemstitch. 
Japanese paper napkins are useful in summer, and for box luncheons. 

The dishes. — Only a few practical suggestions can be given here. 
This is a topic for the art class. 

Buy from "open stock." This means, not a single set, but a 
pattern that the manufacturer and retailer have always on hand, so 
that the purchaser can buy one plate or cup and saucer, to replace 
breakage. 

An elaborate or highly colored design becomes wearisome, is 
not practical for those who have a limited supply of dishes, and is 
in questionable taste. A positive color demands always the same 
general scheme for other decorations. A band of color, or a narrow 
design at the edge, of a color harmonizing easily with other colors, 
is in good taste. Gold and green are safe colors. See Fig. 72. 
White dishes with a raised border are dainty, and any color scheme 
may be used with them. See Fig. 71. 

The number of dishes depends upon the simplicity or elaborate- 
ness of the method of living and the size of the family. It is much 
better to begin with a few, and increase the number when neces- 
sary, than to have the shelves filled with unused ware. (See 
exercises.) 

Glassware is pressed or cut, the latter being beautiful, but an 
expensive luxury. Glasses for water, and dishes for berries, are made 
with simple and attractive designs in the pressed ware, and serve 
all ordinary purposes. A pretty shape for the glass for water, is 
shown in Fig. 71.

Silver and plated silver for knives, forks, and spoons, coffee and 
tea sets, all add to the charm of the table. A large collection is 
not necessary for everyday use, and it adds greatly to the labor of 
the housewife. Figure 70 shows some good designs in spoons, 
and spoons and forks of different sizes come in the same design. A 
simple design is easy to clean. Three sizes of spoons, tablespoons, 
teaspoons, and coffee spoons, and two sizes of forks are all suffi- 
cient, with a few larger spoons for service and desserts. 

Triple-plated ware lasts for years, if well cared for, and comes 
in good designs. 

Pewter, familiar in olden days, is being used again in Colonial 
designs, and makes an attractive tea or coffee set, is less costly 
than solid silver, and has a better tone and color than plated ware. 

CuUery, -^ Plated knives are easy to care for, but steel knives 
are more effective for some purposes. Purchase good quality steel 
knives, especially in the carving set. 

Setting the table. — The first principles here are to have 
everything clean and shining, and to lay everything straight. 
Have as little on the table as possible. It is not comfortable 
to have a large array of articles at one's place. Figure 71 
shows you a dainty and well-laid table, arranged for a Sunday- 
night supper, and this arrangement is a good one for any 
meal, with substitutes for the chafing dish. 

Be sure that the doth is straight, the center fold in the middle of 
the table, and that the cloth hangs evenly on all sides. See that 
centerpiece and doihes are laid at even distance. . 

Laying each place. — In Fig. 71 the knife, edge out, is at the right, 
with one spoon, and the glass is at the right, in Une with the end of 
the knife. Two forks are at the left, and a plate for bread and but- 
ter, with bread knife are at the left, opposite the glass. The napkin 
is at the left. This plan, somewhat elaborated, may be safely fol- 
lowed for formal service. Two knives may be placed at the right, 
with the soup spoon, and three forks at the left. If more than 
these are needed, they may be supplied later, laid on the plate placed 
for a certain course, in the middle of the plate, handle toward the 
guest.

The other articles on the table may vary widely. For every- 
day use, where there is no maid, or only one, set in places convenient 
to pass, the salt and pepper, vinegar and sugar, bread plate and 
butter plate, and any small dish of condiment or pickle, with pretty 
mats for the hot dishes to be set on later, and enough spoons for 
serving. See that the arrangement is symmetrical and convenient. 
A table laid in this way has room for little more in the way of 
" decoration " than a slender vase holding a few flowers in the center. 
The dishes for dessert can be ready on a side table. 

For formal service nothing is placed on the table in addition 
to the equipment at each place, but some centerpiece containing 
ferns or flowers, with pretty dishes of silver or glass holding relishes, 
candies, or dried fruits, a graceful arrangement being to alternate 
four of these with four candlesticks for meals served late in the 
day. 

Table decorations, — Here fancy may run riot with color schemes, 
and pretty devices for special occasions. A painted place card, a 
small bonbon box, a single flower with a pin for fastening it on, — • 
all these have their place at times. Satin ribbon is not an appropriate 
table decoration laid across the table in a broad band, even when it 
displays a class color. Find some other way to make the color 
effective. A color scheme in the food can be carried out to a degree 
for some occasion, but do not let the color interfere with a really 
satisfactory menu. 

Relishes have already been suggested as decoration — radishes 
cut in rose shape, olives, candies, and fruit. 

The tray for invalid and convalescent, — Figures 72 and 73 suggest 
the daintiness possible in setting a tray. It is well worth while to 
spend time in the careful arrangement of the tray, for pretty dishes 
in orderly array may tempt the appetite of the invalid. 

Waiting on the table. — When we wait on ourselves, this 
should be done with cheerfulness, and all should take a share. 
After the food is on the table, one person can *' help " one 
thing and one another. It is a good plan for the young people 
of the family to take turns as waiter in removing the soiled 
dishes and food and putting on the dessert. A quick method 
is to place a tray on a small stand near the table, taking the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



274 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

dishes from one place at a time, and sorting them on the tray 
as you go. The tray can then be carried into the kitchen, 
with the dishes partly arranged for washing. 

One mother uses a plan for having everybody help at 
breakfast time, modeled after the tray system of a cafeteria. 
The breakfast is cooked ready to serve, and on the kitchen 
table is a small tray for each one of the family of four. All 
necessary articles are at hand, and even the boy of seven sets 
his own tray and helps himself to food, and takes his place 
at the table; and then when the meal is ended each one 
carries out his dishes and puts them in neat array for washing. 

The waitress at a formal meal has to be alert, rapid yet 
gentle in all her motions, with a desire to make other 
people comfortable, and a faculty for remembering their 
likes and dislikes. A good waitress does not pass a second 
time a dish once declined. 

The waitress must know the menu, and have everything 
ready for each coiu-se at hand on the sideboard, with dishes 
kept hot in the hot closet. 

The table is laid in time, she herself is immaculate, and the 
room is well aired and the temperature agreeable. A piece 
of bread is folded in each napkin. If the first coiu'se is cold, 
— perhaps a grapefruit, — she arranges these at each place. 
If it is to be a hot bouillon, the cook tells her that all is ready, 
and then she informs the hostess that dinner or luncheon is 
served. 

The details of this t>'pe of waiting vary with the. place and 
the taste of the hostess, but the following method is simple 
and rapid. 

Serving. — Serve everything from the side table. Hold the 
dish to be served firmly in two hands with a napkin underneath, 
a tablespoon and fork being placed on the dish. Pass to the left 
of the guest, and hold the dish at a convenient height and near the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



II 



276 F00D8 AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

plate. After all the dishes in a course are passed in this way, watch 
to see if second helps are needed. 

Remove the soiled plates at the left, and place the clean at the 
left, removing with the left hand and placing with the right. 

Fill glasses at the right, and remove silver at the right before 
dessert when there are pieces left unused. 

Brush crumbs with a soft, folded napkin upon a plate, at the 
left, just before dessert when everything is taken from the table 
but the center decoration, the candies, and the glass of water. 
With* this plan the guest helps himself each time, even the after 
dinner coffee being passed on a tray with cream and sugar, and he 
can take as little as he pleases, or decline. Some hostesses have some 
of the courses arranged on individual plates and placed, and these 
may be placed either from the left or right. But the other method 
is simple and satisfactory. 

/ The finger bowls may be set on plates of dessert size with a 
doily underneath. If a spoon or fork is needed with the dessert, 
one or both may be placed on the plate also, one on each side, if both 
are used. The bowls should be less than half full of water and the 
water should be a comfortable temperature, neither cold nor notice- 
ably warm. Set the plates arranged in this way before each guest. 
The guest himself will remove the bowl and doily and silver before 
the dessert is passed. In large banquets the food must be placed 
on the individual plate. 

The question is sometimes asked, ** Who shall be served first? " 
It is a good plan to change this from course to course, begin- 
ning the first time with the guest of honor. It is not a matter of 
great importance, provided no one has to wait long. Two waitresses 
make the service quicker. 

The guests of honor sit at the right of the host and hostess. 

The number of courses. — Two or three courses are enough for 
everyday comfort and health. In formal serving, it is good taste 
not to have too many. A first course of grapefruit or perhaps 
oyster cocktail, a soup, a fish course, or some light substitute for it, 
— the main course with meat, a salad, dessert, coffee — make a quite 
sufficient meal. The " entree " is a light dish, say sweetbreads in 
cases, after the fish course, but it is quite unnecessary. Many 
people are becoming very weary of the long-drawn-out dinners and 
banquets, which are certainly far from hygienic. 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 277 

Carving. — This is an art that used to be taught as an 
accomplishment to girls, and it is not an easy matter to master. 

If not done at the table, it must nevertheless be well done. 
Watch a good carver, and practice when you have a chance. A few 
simple directions can be given, but a demonstration is really neces- 
sary. First and foremost, have a sharp, strong knife, and a strong 
fork. The next essential is a platter large enough to hold the meat, 
without having it slip off. The fork must be firmly placed in the 
meat, and the meat held down.. Notice the shape of the cut of 
meat. Meat must be cut across the grain. Loosen from the bone, 
notice the grain, and cut evenly and firmly. With fowl, discover 
the joints, pierce with the end of the knife, disjoint, and lay at the 
side, and then slice the breast across the grain. If carving at the 
table, learn the preference of those served, whether they wish light 
or dark meat, meat well done or underdone. Have a spoon for 
dish gravy and stufi&ng.

CHAPTER XVII 
THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 

This is at all times an important matter, but the notable 
increase in food prices, during the last decade, has made it a 
matter of interest to all. The cost of food is one item only 
in the whole cost of living, and this is afifected by many con- 
ditions in manufacture and conmierce and the business of 
the nations. Economists and others interested in social 
questions are studying the problem, but as yet they do not 
agree upon the cause, or causes, of the increased cost of Uving. 
We cannot hope, therefore, to understand the situation fully ; 
but we must be determined to spend money as wisely as we 
can, and to learn what we may about food prices in relation to 
food values. There are a few causes of the difference in price 
between one food and another that are more or less unchang- 
ing. The cost of food may be considered from several points 
of view. The question of the cost for each individual a day 
and relation of cost and nutritive value are studied in Chapter 
XVIII. ^ The proportion of the income to be spent for food 
is taken up in Chapter XIX. 

Labor and prices. — The amount of labor involved in 
producing a food material affects its price. Meats cost 
more than staple vegetable foods, like com, wheat, or beans, 
because we must raise the com first to feed the animals. 
Meat is as cheap as vegetable foods only when the animal 
can find its own food, as in the pioneer days of any country, 
when only a small part of the land is imder cultivation. To 
the Pilgrim Fathers, meat was cheaper than com, in terms of 

278 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 279 

labor, with deer at hand in the forest and corn raised with 
difficulty in small clearings. Meat production is now an 
industry, and the product an expensive one, especially as the 
wide cattle ranges of our West, where the animals have for- 
merly found natural food, are now used more and more for 
other purposes. 

Transportation. — Carrying food from place to place in- 
creases its cost. In one sense this is another form of labor. 
Each person who handles the food material from producer 
to consumer adds something to what the consumer pays. 
We have heard much discussion of late of the " middleman," 
and the effort to bring the producer and consumer closer 
together. This simply means doing away with some person 
who handles the product after it leaves the producer and 
before it reaches the consumer and who must have something 
for his labor. In transportation there is another element in- 
volved, the original cost of the means of conveyance ; and the 
natural wear and tear on the product are items that increase 
the final cost. The modern farmer who carries his produce 
to market in an auto truck must have a return for the original 
cast of the truck and the keeping of it in repair. The long- 
distance railway furnishes cold-storage cars, and the cost* of 
these and their maintenance afifect freight rates. A peach 
from South Africa costs from fifty to sixty cents in the Boston 
market. It is probably true, in this case, that a fancy price 
is asked because African fruit is a novelty here ; but the diffi- 
culty and expense of long-distance transportation naturally 
make it costly. 

Demand and supply. — The relation of demand to supply 
affects the price of food in a way not difficult to understand. 
Where the supply is permanently small and the demand 
widespread, the price of the particular food material will be 
high, and vice versa. Olive oil is a good example of the per- 



280 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

manently high-priced food. California olive oil brings a high 
price not only because it is pure and well flavored, but be- 
cause many people want it, and the industry is a small one. 
Many years are needed to establish an olive grove, and olive 
raising is not a popular way of making money, because it is 
slow. One enterprising American firm has bought an olive 
grove in Spain, and is using new methods there, but the prod- 
uct, though delicious, is no cheaper. Although the manu- 
facture of olive oil will doubtless remain a rather small in- 
dustry, the use of olive oil is increasing, in this coimtry, at 
least. It does not seem likely, therefore, to become a cheap 
form of fat. 

We find nearly the opposite of this in cottonseed oil, a 
large supply and a relatively smaller demand making a low 
price. The seed (a by-product of the cotton industry) con- 
tains a large quantity of oil, and it is not all used as food. 
Therefor^, it is permanently a low-priced fat, as contrasted 
with the permanently high-priced fat, olive oil. 

Agricultural conditions. — There are two things of which 
the farmer can never feel sure, the kind of weather to expect 
and the general character of the season. Of course, the 
season afifects the quality and the amount of any crop, and 
this, again, influences the price. 

Another aspect of the effect of season on food is this : that 
a food is in its own locality cheaper when it is in season than at 
other times of year, when it has to be brought from a distance. 

Insect pests and plant diseases not infrequently spoil a 
crop, and the market price goes up with the smaller supply. 
This is what happened not long since to the potato crop and 
potato prices, when potatoes were affected by the potato 
blight. Moreover, if the farmer succeeds in keeping his 
crop free from a particular pest, it means a more or less per- 
manent increase in his expenses, for in fighting insects and 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 281 

fungi there is an outlay for machinery and chemicals, and 
much labor is expended. Unfortunately, injurious insects 
and plant diseases are on the increase, and this may mean a 
permanent rise in the cost of certain foods. Another fact 
has to be reckoned with in comparing the prices of different 
foods. Some vegetables are more difficult to raise than 
others, even when the season is favorable, and the insects 
at least partly conquered. Some plants have more vitality 
than others, and grow under almost any condition of soil and 
moisture. 

Animal diseases must also affect the price of food. If a 
large number of cattle are found to have tuberculosis, and 
are condemned as food, healthy cattle bring a higher price, 
because, again, the supply is small in relation to the demand. 

Quality of food. — Poor food always costs less money than 
good food, but it may not be economy to buy it. There 
may be more usable material in one good apple at five cents 
than in three wormy ones for five. 

Form and place in which food is sold. — Food in the 
package costs more than in bulk, and each fancy label adds a 
fraction to the cost. Plate-glass windows and ribbon decora- 
tions in a shop and the large expense of rent on a fashionable 
street are all paid for by the consumer. 

Relative cost of home and shop products. — When pre- 
pared food of any kind is purchased, one pays for raw mate- 
rial plus the cost of fuel and the labor involved in the cooking 
and the cleaning of apparatus and ,kitchen. For example, 
canned soup sold by one of the best manufacturers brings 
a good price because so much time and labor are used in a 
careful inspection of all material, and in keeping up a high 
standard of cleanliness. Remember, too, that whenever 
cooked food appears on the table, these two items, fuel and 
labor, are in reality added to the cost of the raw material. 



282 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We may not pay cash always for the labor, but it must be 
accounted for in time and energy. The woman who says, 
" My time doesn't count," has a poor opinion of herself. 
Whether or not it is better to buy cooked food or to prepare 
food at home is discussed on page 292. 

Other elements in food prices. — So far we have considered 
those causes of food prices that are what m.ay be called 
" natural," always to be taken into account, and only partly 
under our control. There are others that have to do with 
big business methods and interests and that have great in- 
fluence at some one period in a nation's life, and less at others. 
They are more or less under our control if we have the wis- 
dom and courage to act. A discussion of these causes is 
part of the study of economics proper, and we can only stop 
by the way to think of them for a moment. 

Transportation must always increase cost, as we have 
learned, but bad methods, involving the handling of food by 
many people, increase it unnecessarily. Our present methods 
of marketing food are clumsy, and not economical, especially 
in large cities. The subject is being seriously studied with a 
view to improvement, possibly by the establishment of public 
markets. - 

At present we have a bewildering state of things, but the 
housekeeper who sincerely desires, can learn to buy and pre- 
pare the less eostly foods in an appetizing way, and leave 
nothing for the garbage pail but the parts that are actually 
not eatable. 

Comparative costs. — It would be useless to print here a 
list of actual prices, since they vary in different localities, 
and are constantly changing. This list can be made by 
yourselves in your notebooks for your own home town, and 
for the current year. The table on page 317 is a guide, how- 
ever, for in spite of fluctuations in prices there are certain 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 



283 



foods that are permanently more economical than others ; 
for example, grain products than meats, for reasons already 
explained. As a rule, the rising cost of food has been so 
general as not to change greatly the relative economy of the 
different types of food as compared with each other. 

Cost and N nutritive value. — The discussion of cost has 
dealt so far with the cost of food materials as they are found 
in the market. What we are really seeking to learn is the 
amount of nutritive material to be obtained for a given sum 
of money, and in order to do this, we must think of our pur- 
chases in terms of the foodstuffs and their values. The 
accompanying table from a government bulletin ^ gives an 
elstimate of cost from this point of view in terms of protein 
and fuel value. Notice that wheat bread is a cheap food, 
standing first in the amount of building material and energy.

The price quoted for eggs is low, and even less could be ob- 
tained for ten cents at prevailing prices in 1913-1914. This 
kind of estimate is a help in making menus and dietaries. 
(See Chapter XVIII.) Another method of estimating econ- 
omy for this purpose is by calculating the cost of lOO-Calorie 
portions of various food materials. A table giving such a 
comparison will be found in the next chapter. 

Purchasing Food 

In addition to the general principles of buying discussed 
in Chapter XXI there are some details to be studied in 
purchasing food. 

Personal attention in bu3ring food. — It is absolutely 
necessary to visit the market and the grocery where food is 
purchased. The purchaser would not fail to visit a shop 
before deciding to patronize it regularly, but frequent calls 
are necessary if buying is to be economical. Select the 
grocery, market, and bakery with a view to their cleanliness. 
Notice if the doors and windows are screened, and if proper 
effort is made to catch flies that may have entered. Refuse 
to buy food that is exposed upon the sidewalk, and if it is 
within doors, see that it is protected from dust and flies. 
The best markets now have tiled walls and floors, which help 
to insure cleanliness. The difference in odor is marked be- 
tween a market that is properly cleaned daily, and one where 
the proprietor uses uncleanly methods. Meat and vege- 
tables, in particular, should be personally selected whenever 
this is possible. The butcher must understand that the pur- 
chaser is familiar with the different cuts of meat and that 
honest service is demanded in regard to the quality, trimming, 
and weight of the meat. One does not want to be too sus- 
picious, but it is well for the butcher to know that the pur- 
chaser has a set of standard scales at home by which to prove 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 285 

the accuracy of his weighing. It is also important to inspect 
fruit and vegetables for quality and cost. 

Quantities in which to purchase food. — The amount that 
one purchases of a certain food depends on its keeping quali- 
ties, and upon the storage space available at home. A gen- 
eral rule may be stated: Buy perishable foods in small 
quantities; non-perishable foods in large. The reason for 
buying in larger quantity is that the cost is somewhat less, 
although sometimes it seems but little less. Some one has 
remarked that no one is a good buyer who does not consider 
a quarter of a cent. In a modern house or apartment where 
there is not room for a barrel of flour or sugar, then the 
quantity must be gauged by the space. The same is true of 
canned goods as of flour and sugar. Buying by the dozen 
saves a little on each can if you have shelf room for piling the 
cans. 

Foods may be classed in this connection as perishable, 
semi-perishable, and non-perishable. This depends some- 
what for any one housekeeper upon the size of her refrigera- 
tor, and upon an available place where food may be cool, 
even if not so cold as in the refrigerator. Those foods 
classed here as perishable are those which readily *' spoil," 
that is, those that are affected by mold and bacteria on ac- 
count of the moisture that they contain, and also those that 
lose flavor and freshness quickly. Those most easily affected 
should be kept the coldest; those in the semi-perishable 
group do not deteriorate so rapidly, although a low tem- 
perature is desirable with all of these. Under the non-perish- 
able foods are classed those that are not subject to bacteria 
or mold in ordinary circumstances. . These should be kept 
dry, however, and never in a heated place. In a sense, no 
food material is non-perishable. Insects sometimes develop 
in the cereal products, for instance, and the material is thus 



286 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

rendered unfit for food. The food adjuncts do not spoil 
except as they lose flavor if kept too long. 

Perishable. — Milk, cream, uncooked meat, uncooked fish, shell- 
fish, herries, fruits with deUcate skins, lettuce, and vegetables that 
wilt easily. 

Semi-periahable. — Butter, eggs, cooked meat and fish, root 
vegetables, cooked vegetables, left overs in general, skin fruits like 
apples, bananas, oranges, and lemons, dried fruits, scalded milk 
and cream, smoked and salted fish and meats, open molasses and 
sirup. 

NoTi'periahable, — Floiu", meals and cereals, sugar, salt, and other 
condiments and flavorings, jellies, preserves and canned goods, 
coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate. 

Suggestions for bu3ring. — Milk and cream must be de- 
livered daily. The average amount used by the family is 
the regular order. Fresh meat should be delivered on the 
day wanted unless the refrigerator is large with a space for 
hanging meat. Even then, it should not be kept more than 
twenty-four hours. Meat should not be placed directly on 
the ice. Fresh berries and delicate vegetables should be 
delivered on the day wanted. Butter and eggs may be pur- 
chased once a week; other semi-perishables in quantities 
depending on storage space. It is economical to buy a box 
of lemons, and the root vegetables in large quantities. Flour 
and sugar are purchased by the bag or barrel ; lump sugar, 
in boxes. Breakfast cereals are best bought in packages, 
and it is wise not to buy a large number at one time. 
It is better to purchase oftcner and have fresher material. 
Coffee may be bought in pound cans, but it is economy to 
purchase it in five or ten pound quantities, unground. Tea 
comes in closely sealed packages, in J, i, and 1 lb. and 
larger. Cocoa is bought in i lb. cans, but it is economy 
to buy in large cans if it is frequently used. Macaroni is 
bought by the package, and the number at one time must 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 287 

depend on how much it is used in the menu. Rice, tapioca, 
and sago may be bought in bulk and kept in tin or glass jars. 
Salt by the bag or "box. Spices, ground, in tight boxes; 
whole in bulk, to be kept in tightly closed cans. Molasses 
comes by the gallon or in cans. If in bulk, it is usually acid ; 
in the can it is not. Vinegar comes by the gallon, or in 
bottles. Canned and preserved goods, singly, by the dozen, 
or case. Bakery products, when bought at all, should be 
purchased daily, or every other day. Do not buy so much 
that stale bread accumulates. 

Weights, measures, and packages. — The buyer is at a 
disadvantage here in regard to quantities, for the baskets in 
which fruits and vegetables are sold do not always conform 
to the standard dry measures, and dishonest dealers evade 
the law in regard to the use of standard scales. Even if 
they have the standard, they resort to tricks that give the 
customer short weights. Here the Bureau of Weights and 
Measures, with its Commissioner and corps of inspectors, 
comes to the aid of the purchaser. Effective work has been 
done in our cities in enforcing the laws, and this work con- 
tinues. 

Selling fruit, vegetables, and even eggs by weight would 
simplify matters in many ways, and this is the custom in 
some parts of the United States with vegetables and fruit, 
although it is not yet a common practice ; with eggs it seems 
more convenient to sell by the dozen, but grading according 
to size is a step toward standardization. 

The alluring packages in which so many articles are offered 
are quite uneven as to the quantities they contain. They 
certainly do away with some handling of food, and they keep 
out dust. Unfortunately, an attractive package does not 
guarantee a clean factory or clean handling in the packing. 
Dried figs, for example, in pretty baskets are sometimes 



288 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

packed in uncleanly places. Moreover, small packages are 
poor economy, since the box adds to the cost of the food 
material, and sometimes there seems even more package than 
food. If the family consumes many biscuits or '* crackers,'' 
it costs considerably more to buy them in packages. Yet, 
these are convenient, and should be cleanly, and are justi- 
fied for these reasons, provided the housekeeper does not buy 
many small packages. 

The quantities in canned goods are variable and sometimes 
below measure when purchased from a second-rate dealer. 
In September, 1914, the net weight amendment to the 
National Food Law will go into effect, after which, in general, 
foods sold in packages must be labeled to show net weight 
or measure or numerical count. 

As already suggested, you should own standard scales for 
testing the purchases made by weight, even baker's bread. 
Buy fruit and vegetables by the quart, peck, and bushel, 
rather than by the basket of uncertain measure. Examine 
baskets containing small fruits to see if they have false 
bottoms. If you discover small measure, report at once to 
the dealer, and to whatever authority has charge of such 
matters in your town. 

Quality. — Modern methods of manufacture, transporta- 
tion, and storage make it difficult to determine the history 
and quality of food we purchase in the markets. Yet the 
consumer has a natural right to know if the food offered for 
sale is the best of its kind ; fresh eggs, clean milk, meat from 
healthy animals, untainted and free from harmful preserva- 
tives, sound vegetables and fruit, manufactured and pre- 
served foodstuffs unspoiled by the manufacturing processes, 
free from harmful preservatives, and of good flavor. Many 
people must be in danger of forgetting the flavor of a fresh- 
laid egg. The familiar signs in many small shops, " Fresh 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 289 

eggs," *' Strictly fresh eggs," " Fancy eggs," are amusing, 
but they bespeak an unnatural state of things. 

As our business methods have created conditions beyond 
the control of the individual consumer it follows that we must 
take concerted action, and make and enforce whatever laws 
are necessary. This is done partly through the Federal 
government, and partly through state laws and municipal 
ordinances. Thus, while we may not know the actual con- 
ditions in which food is produced, we may through legislation 
seek to insure that the food we buy shall be 

(1) what it purports to be in kind and amoimt, 

(2) free from deterioration or unwholesome conditions, 

(3) possessed of full nutritive value. 

The Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, com- 
monly known as " The Pure Food Law," and on which sub- 
sequent legislation by most of the states has been largely 
based, defines the main types of adulteration and misbrand- 
ing, but, except in the case of confectionery and of habit- 
forming drugs, does not name the specific substances which 
are to be prohibited or restricted in use, nor does the law 
itself contain standards of composition for foods. 

According to this law a food is deemed adulterated: 

(1) If any substance has been mixed or packed with it. so 
as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or 
strength. 

(2) If any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part. 

(3) If any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part 
abstracted. 

(4) If it be mixed, colored, coated, powdered, or stained 
in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed. 

(5) If it contain any added poisonous or other added 
deleterious ingredient which may render such article in- 
jurious to health. 



290 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decom- 
posed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any por- 
tion of an animal unfit for food, or if it be the product of a 
diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by 
slaughter. 

And a food is deemed to be misbranded : 

(1) If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the 
distinctive name of another article. 

(2) If it be labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead 
the purchaser, or purport to be a foreign product when not 
so, or if the contents shall have been substituted in whole or 
in part, or if it fail to bear a statement on the label of the 
quantity or proportion of any narcotic or habit-forming 
drug which it contains. 

(3) If it bear an incorrect statement of weight or 
measure. 

(4) If the package containing it or its label shall bear any 
statement, design, or device which is false or misleading in 
any particular. 

For a fuller discussion of the basis of pure food legislation 
and the essential features of the United States laws see Sher- 
man's " Food Products," from which a part of the smnmary 
here given is drawn. 

The modern cold storage plant is of immense service in 
keeping food from the season of abundance to that of scar- 
city, but it may prove worse than useless if improperly 
managed. State and federal laws must control the manage- 
ment, and government inspection must be thorough. Cold 
storage would be a benefit to all under proper conditions of 
management, and the prices of many foods would be evenly 
adjusted by the maintenance of a steady supply. Many 
states now have laws regulating cold storage plants and 
there is every reason to hope that the abuses which have 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 291 

sometimes existed will be eliminated and the usefulness of 
cold storage extended. 

We may feel that the progress of the pure food movement 
has been most satisfactory, even though much more remains 
to be done. The states generally have either enacted new 
food laws, or revised their laws following the national law. 
Under the national law over 2000 prosecutions have already 
(1913) been decided in favor of the government. 

Congress has passed an even more stringent law for meat 
inspection supplementary to the Pure Food Law with ample 
appropriation for its enforcement. Moreover, in 1913, the 
Secretary of Agriculture appointed outside experts to in- 
spect meat-packing establishments throughout the country. 
This inspection is to check up the regular work being done 
by the Bureau of Animal Industry. 

The enforcing of federal and state laws has already largely 
stopped the misbranding of package foods as to weight or 
measure, cheap substitutions, the removal of valuable in- 
gredients, and the sale of decomposed or tainted food derived 
from diseased animals. Remember that abuses can be kept 
down to any extent that we are willing to pay for. Tax- 
payers must appropriate money to pay for inspection, for 
laws, no matter how good, will not insure pure food unless 
carried out faithfully by an adequate number of specially 
trained inspectors. 

In the face of all these dij95culties we must not be frightened 
into that state of mind where danger seems to lurk in every 
mouthful. We must use caution and common sense in our 
buying, and earnestly support every good movement for 
bettering conditions. 

There is a certain difference in quality even at a first class 
dealer's that one must learn to distinguish. One can of 
peaches will cost more than another, because the peaches are 



292 FOODS AND HOUSEHOfjD MANAGEMENT 

larger. If it is only this, and there is only a slight difference 
in flavor in favor of the more costly, buy the cheaper by all 
means. A fancy brand of imported preserves brings a fancy 
price which it is not worth while to pay. We have to learn 
to distinguish between poor and good quality, on the one 
hand, and between good and what may be called " fancy," 
on the other. We should demand the good, but most of us 
cannot afford the " fancy." 

Ready-cooked foods. — More and more cooked food, 
canned or otherwise, is taking its place in the market. When 
canned goods were first manufactured on a large scale they 
comprised fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish, but we are now 
accustomed to a miscellaneous variety, including soups, 
baked beans, puddings, and pudding sauces, spaghetti, 
hashed meat, and shellfish. Bakery products have a larger 
sale than ever, and are found in small towns, and even in 
country districts carried there by bakers' wagons. In our 
large cities we find the " delicatessen shop " very common, 
where small portions of cooked meats and fowl may be pur- 
chased after the custom of Europe, and these stores are open 
even on Sunday. 

How shall we decide what is best for us in our buying? 
We must not condemn entirely the buying of cooked food 
without a careful study of the situation. The custom has 
grown with changes in our mode of living, especially in cities, 
where the small apartment is common, and where gas is the 
fuel. Under these conditions it is diflScult to prepare foods 
that need long and slow cooking, and these processes are 
more expensive when gas is used. The long slow cooking of 
soup and beans, the even baking of bread, are diflScult to 
accomplish. The odors from these processes fill the small 
apartment, and scent it for some time, and this is unpleasant 
at all seasons. 



. THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 293 

* 

Take another example, the canning and preserving of 
fruits. The first cost of the fruit is usually high in the city, 
and this plus the sugar and the gas, and the labor and the 
lack of storage space make it seem impracticable in these 
conditions, and many people decide in favor of buying goods 
ah-eady canned. Such housekeeping is simplified by buying 
cooked products to some extent. The fireless cooker helps 
here, but not for all processes. Counting in fuel, the cost is 
not so much greater as we might suppose ; and comfort and 
convenience are increased. Under other conditions, even in 
the city, a different conclusion is reached. If coal is the fuel, 
and a steady fire is kept, perhaps in winter for heating pur- 
poses, then it is economy to cook most food materials at 
home. 

In the country and small village different conditions pre- 
vail. H^re the abundance of certain fruits in season makes 
it economical to can and dry, even counting fuel and labor. 
In some sections many people can their own vegetables also. 
However, even in the country in the summer, it is a decided 
relief to the farmer^s wife, probably short of " help," to win 
a little leisure by buying staple bakery products. Here if 
strict economy is not necessary, is it not better to save 
strength rather than money? Each housekeeper must work 
out these problems for herself.

CHAPTER XVIII 

MENUS AND DIETARIES ^ 

When we have learned to choose and cook wholesome and 
appetizing food we have not solved the whole problem of 
successful feeding. It is possible to make people sick with 
good food, if it is badly selected and fed at wroiig times or in 
unsuitable amounts. Whether children grow to their full 
size and strength depends more upon the choice of their 
food than upon any other one thing. The effect of food is 
strikingly shown in the case of the white rats in Fig. 74. 
The two upper ones are the same age. Both had the same 
mother, lived in the same kind of clean cages, and had plenty 
of food, but the diet of the upper was good for growth, while 
that for the middle one was not. It remained perfectly well, 
but became stunted because of the character of its food. You 
can see that it resembles the lowest one in the illustration, 
which is only one fourth as old. In this chapter we shall 
consider how and when and in what amounts to serve food 
so that every one may get from it the fullest benefit in both 
health and happiness. 

In Chapter I we learned that the body is a working machine 
whose first requirement is fuel. Hence the first considera^ 
tion in the diet is to have the proper amount of fuel for each 
day, to provide energy for the constant internal work that 
keeps the body alive, and for the variable external work

which may be so light as to consist of the few movements 
that one makes lying in bed, or sitting quietly ; or so hard 
as to exercise many muscles, as playing tennis, bicycling, or 
swimming. 

Energy requirements of adults. — We have also learned 
something about the foods which supply this enei^; we 
must now find out how much fuel (in the form of food) it 
takes to do different amounts of work, just as the owner of 
an automobile wants to know how much gasoline per mile 
or per hour is required to nm his machine under different 
conditions. Very careful experiments have been made on 
many men in different ways to measure their energy output, 



FiQ. 7S. — Heapiration calorimeter, open. From the "Journal of Biological 
Cheniistry." 



298 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the most accurate and interesting being those made in a 
respiration calorimeter, a device so delicate as to be able to 
measure the extra heat ^ven off when one changes from lying 
perfectly quiet to sitting up equally still, thus adding the 
work of holding the upper part of the body upright. A 
respiration calorimeter large enough to hold a child is shown 
in Figs. 75 and 76. You can see that it consists of a chamber 



From the "Journal of Bio- 



with thick walls to prevent loss of heat. In Fig. 75 the door 
is open. When an experiment is going on the door is closed, 
as in Fig. 76, air being fiunished through special tubes. The 
walls are fitted with delicate thermometers and every device 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 299 

which will help to get the exact amount of heat given off 
from the body is employed. 

Just as it takes more fuel to run a big machine than a 
little one, so it takes more energy for a large person than a 
small one; therefore we must know the weight of the one 
whose food requirements we wish to calculate, as well as the 
amount of energy required to do different kinds and amoimts 
of work. The following table will help in calculating the 
approximate fuel requirements of any grown person. The 
food needs of children and young people under twenty-five 
will be discussed later. 

Approximate Energy Requirements of Averaqe-sized Man 

Occupation Calories per pound 

per hour 

Sleeping 0.4 

Sitting quietly 0.6 

At light muscular exercise ........ 1.0 

At active muscular exercise ........ 2.0 

At severe muscular exercise ........ 3.0 

Light exercise may be understood to include work equiv- 
alent to standing and working with the hands, as at a desk 
in chemistry or cookery ; or work involving the feet like walk- 
ing or running a sewing machine. Many persons, as stu- 
dents, stenographers, seamstresses, bookkeepers, teachers, and 
tailors do little or no work heavier than this. 

Active exercise involves more muscles, as in bicycling 
compared with walking, or exercise with dumb-bells as com- 
pared with typewriting. Carpenters, general houseworkers, 
and mail carriers do about this grade of work while on duty. 

Severe exercise not only involves a good many muscles, 
but causes enough strain to harden and enlarge them. Bicy- 
cUng up grade, swimming, and other active sports would be 
included in this kind of exercise. Lumbermen, excavators, 
and a few others do even heavier work than this. 



300 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Knowing the weight of a grown man or woman, and some- 
thing of the daily occupation, as in the case of a professional 
man, we can estimate the probable energy requirement 
somewhat as follows : 

Sleeping, 8 hours ; 8 X 0.4 Calories = 3.2 Calories per pound. 
Sitting quietly (at meals, reading, etc.), 8 hours ; 8 X 0.6 Calories 

= 4.8 per pound. 
At light muscular exercise (dressing, standing, walking, etc.), 

6 X 1.0 Calories = 6.0 Calories per pound 
At active muscular exercise 2 hours, 2 X 2.0 Calories 

= 4 Calories per pound. 

Total Calories per poimd for 24 hours, 18 ; 18 X 154 poimds 
(the weight of the average man) = 2772, or approximately 
2680, Calories per day required. Calculate in this way the 
energy requirement for various grown persons whom you 
know. 

Energy requirements during growth. — In estimating food 
requirements of those who are under twenty-five years old, 
we must bear in mind that the same materials which serve 
for fuel serve in part for building material. Protein is used 
for muscle building as well as for supplying energy, and the 
larger one grows, the greater the reserves of carbohydrate 
and fat which he can carry. Furthermore, internal activity 
is greater in the young than the middle aged or very old, and 
external activity is apt also to be greater. Think, for in- 
stance, how much running children do compared with their 
parents. For all these reasons, we cannot use the table for 
adults in calculating the energy requirement of young people. 
In the following table an attempt has been made to take ac- 
count of their greater needs, but the estimates include only 
moderate exercise; with hard work more will be required. 
Notice that the highest allowance per pound of body weight 
is for the youngest children.

6-9 36-30 

10-13 30-27 

14-17 27-20 

17-25 not less than 18 

With these two tables for calculating energy requirement 
we can determine about how much will be needed by each 
member of the family. A group consisting of a professional 
man, his wife, and three children under 16 will require about 
10,000 Calories per day ; a workingman's family with the 
same number of children from 12,000 to 14,000, because of 
the harder work which both parents and possibly the chil- 
dren will do. 

Protein requirement. — Since few of our foods consist 
of a single foodstuff, and we are not likely to make even a 
single meal on pure fat, or pure protein, or pure carbohydrate 
alone, we are sure to get some building material in any diet, 
but we must see to it that we are getting amounts which 
furnish the best possible conditions for growth and repair. 

As we have already seen, nitrogen in the form of protein 
is necessary to the life of every cell in the body. From pro- 
tein, too, muscle is built, though we cannot build good muscle 
merely by feeding protein ; a diet moderate in its amount of 
protein, but with plenty of fuel for healthy exercise is best 
for muscle building. Under all ordinary conditions, if ten 
to fifteen Calories in every hundred (10 to 15 per cent of the 
total Calories) are from protein, the need for this kind of 
building material will be met. Thus a family requiring 
10,000 Calories per day should have from 1000 to 1500 of 
these as protein Calories. The following table gives the pro-

Notice that feome foods, like bread, have about the right 
proportion of protein calories ; others, like beef, beans, and 
peas are very high in protein calories. By combining some 
foods high in protein with others containing little or none, we 
can get the right proportion. Thus, 100 Calories of beef 
combined with 400 each of bread and butter will give 900 
Calories of which 114, or 12.7 per cent, are from protein.

It is interesting to work out other combinations which give 
these good proportions. 

Ash requirement. — We are also assured of ash in any ordi- 
nary diet, but some attention should be paid to kind and 
amount, especially as many common foods have lost the parts 
richest in ash. Patent flour, for instance, made from the 
inner part of the grain, is not so rich in ash as whole or cracked 
wheat. Valuable salts are also lost in cooking vegetables 
when the water in which they were cooked is thrown away. 
If not desired with the vegetable, this should be saved for 
gravy or soup. It is not necessary to calculate a definite 
amount of ash for the diet, if ash-bearing foods are freely 
used. By reference to the table on page 384 you can see what 
foods are valuable for supplying the important kinds of ash. 
Milk is particularly rich in calcium and hence is required 
when the bones are growing. Eggs have iron and phosphorus 
in forms well suited to growth. But if eggs are too expensive. 



304 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the vegetables and fruits generally will supply these same 
substances. 

Diet for growth. — Diets made in the chemical labora- 
tory from mixtures of pure (isolated) protein, fat, carbohy- 
drate, and ash to satisfy all the requirements which we have 
so far mentioned, do not behave alike when fed to animals. 
The kind of protein is important as well as the amount. 
This is shown by experiments in which only one protein is 
fed at a time. On some, the animals will not thrive. On 
others, adult animals do very well, but the young ones be- 
come stunted like the one shown on page 296. Milk has 
been found to contain proteins on which young animals can 
thri^'^e. But even in diets containing the protein from milk, 
young animals do not develop normally unless the salts of 
milk are added too. No perfect substitute for milk has ever 
been found. During the first year of life, a child lives on it 
almost exclusively ; for the first five years it should be con- 
sidered the most important article in the diet ; and through- 
out the period of growth it should be freely used if children 
are to become vigorous men and women. If not liked as a 
beverage, it can be used in cocoa, or cereal cofifee, in soups, 
puddings, and other dishes. Considering what milk may 
save in the way of more expensive protein foods, such as eggs 
and meat, and of ash-supplying foods like fruits and vege- 
tables, it is to be regarded as a cheap food. It is possible to 
get the proper amounts of fuel and protein from white bread 
and meat, but such a diet is poorly balanced as to ash con- 
stituents and especially lacks calcium. It would need to be 
balanced by adding some fruit or vegetable and even then 
would not contain as much calcium as is best for growing 
people. A diet of bread and milk, on the other hand, is so 
nearly perfectly balanced (supplying fuel, protein, and ash 
constituents in suitable amounts) that it can be taken ex- 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 305 

clusively for a long time. Whole wheat bread and milk 
would be even better, because the whole wheat would supply 
more iron, in which white bread and milk are not rich. The 
addition of fruits and vegetables to the bread and milk diet 
would also be an advantage — partly for the same reason. ^ 

Other foods especially valuable for growth are eggs and 
cereals from whole grains. Children should acquire the 
habit of eating fruits and green vegetables of all kinds, for 
when they are older and likely to take less milk and cereals, 
the fruits and vegetables supply important ash constituents 
and also help to prevent constipation. 

The foods good for children are also good for adults, but 
the latter can keep their bodies in good repair with less 
protein and ash in proportion to body weight than are re- 
quired during growth, and many kinds of protein serve for 
repair. If there are not enough milk and eggs to go around, 
adults can take meat, nuts, peas, beans and bread for protein, 
and trust to these and fruit and vegetables for ash. When 
the body has been wasted by sickness, however, a return to 
the foods of growth, especially a diet of milk and eggs, is 
best for building it up again. 

The number of meals in a day. — Knowing how much and 
what kinds of food are best for each member of the family, 
we must next find out how to divide the total food for the 
day into meals. Few of us could take our required fuel in 
one meal, and if we could, we should probably be hungry 
before the time for the next meal. Some persons get along 
very well with two meals a day, but usually their fuel re- 
quirement is not high. Most people are more comfortable 
and more likely to eat a suitable amount in a deliberate 
fashion if they have three meals a day. When large amounts 
of fuel have to be taken, four or five meals may be better than 
three ; babies who have to eat in proportion to their size. 



306 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

often 2i times as much as their mothers, take 2\ times as 
many meals, i.e. 7 or 8 in a day. 

The amount of food for each meal. — While the number 
of meals depends largely on the amount to be eaten in the 
whole day, and the appetite of the subject, the amount at each 
meal is most influenced by the nature of the daily occupation. 
The baby with nothing to do but eat and sleep has meals 
uniform in kind and amount. The business man who works 
very hard through the middle of the day, and has not time 
to take an elaborate meal, nor time to rest after it so that it 
may digest easily, takes a light luncheon and makes up for it 
at breakfast and dinner. The outdoor worker who has a long 
hard day and expends much energy, takes an hour at noon for 
a substantial dinner, in addition to a hearty breakfast and 
supper and sometimes a mid-forenoon or mid-afternoon lunch. 

Regularity of meals. — More important than the number 
of meals is regularity as to time of eating and amount of 
food. Training for the digestive tract is just as important 
as training the eye or the hand or the brain. We cannot 
expect good digestions if we have a hearty luncheon to-day, 
none at all to-morrow, and perhaps a scanty and hasty late 
one the next day. To take food into the stomach between 
meals is to demoralize the digestive system. Foods that 
are excellent as part of a meal provoke headaches and bad 
complexions, and many symptoms of a protesting stomach, 
when taken between meals. The younger the person, the 
more important is regularity. Little children soon suffer if 
their meals are not " on the minute." Adults have more 
difficulty in controlling their time, but if they have to be 
late to meals, they should be more careful than usual to eat 
slowly and to choose plain simple food that will digest easily. 

Mental attitude toward meals. — Good food may be pro- 
vided at the proper time and yet the members of a family 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 307 

may fail to keep well and happy unless they come to meals 
in the right condition. Haste, chill, exhaustion, anxiety, 
excitement, fretfulness, or anger may interfere with the 
digestion of the most digestible of meals. Orderly table 
service, good manners, and cheerful conversation are very 
important factors in the success of a meal. Peace and joy 
as well as " calories" are watchwords of good nutrition. 

Balanced meals. — Having determined how many meals 
to serve in the day and what their hours shall be, the next 
question is how to choose and distribute the constituents of 
the day's ration so as to promote digestibility and satisfac- 
tion. A meal of pure protein, or fat, or carbohydrate would 
not be relished, and would have some physiological disad- 
vantages. Digestion is likely to be more complete on a 
mixed diet. A meal of carbohydrate alone leaves the stom- 
ach more quickly than any other kind, and one would feel 
hungry before the next meal, though one might have had 
plenty of fuel ; a meal of fat alone would leave the stomach 
very slowly, and one would not have so good an appetite 
for the next meal ; a meal of pure protein would stimulate 
heat production without any particular advantages, except 
possibly in very cold weather : it would be decidedly undesir- 
able in hot weather. For these and other reasons it is best 
to have the different foodstuffs represented in each meal, 
and to see that no one contains an excess of fat, which tends 
to retard all digestion. This is what is usually meant by a 
balanced meal, but it may also include care that about the 
same proportion of fuel is served at the same meal each day. 
A meal does not need to be " balanced " in quite the same 
sense as a day's ration. The latter must have a definite 
amount of fuel, a suitable proportion of protein, ash well 
represented, some food for bulk, the whole selected with 
regard for the physical condition, tastes, habits, and pocket- 
books of those to be fed. 



308 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Menus. — Food taken at a stated time constitutes a meal. 
It may consist of a single food material, as bread, or a single 
dish, as soup; or it may contain many kinds of food and 
many dishes. When the day's ration consists of a single food, 
there is no trouble in arranging the bill of fare, for all meals 
are alike. But as soon as we have two foods, we may con- 
sider whether they will digest better if eaten together or 
separately, and which way they will please the palate better. 
Balanced diets do not necessarily afford attractive menus. 
Macaroni and oatmeal would make a fairly well balanced 
meal except as regards ash constituents, but no one would call 
such a combination pleasing. By the substitution of a little 
cheese and an orange for the oatmeal, a meal containing 
about the same fuel value and proportion of protein could be 
arranged, and it would certainly appeal more to the appetite, 
and furnish better proportions of ash constituents. 

In the construction of the menu for the day or meal, we 
must consider not only food values and time of day and com- 
binations which shall be digestible, but flavor, color, texture, 
and temperature of our foods. The study of digestible com- 
binations belongs to the science of nutrition. The harmoni- 
ous blending of tastes, odors, colors, and the like is an art. 
Just as there are pleasing combinations of sound, so there 
are harmonies of flavor; certain dishes seem naturally to 
'* go together." Habit has a great deal to *do with food 
combinations. A Chinaman would not eat sugar on rice; 
a Japanese would not cook beans with molasses as the Bos- 
tonian does. It is interesting to experiment with new com- 
binations, and study to find out why old ones are pleasing. 
Why do we like crackers with soup? Butter on bread? 
Toast with eggs? Peas with lamb chops? 

Digestible menus. — Some of our eating habits are worth 
preserving and cultivating. Fresh fruit for breakfast stimu- 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 309 

lates the appetite and helps to prevent or overcome constipa- 
tion. A mild-flavored food Uke cereal is better relished be- 
fore we have had meats or other highly flavored food. Soup 
at the beginning of a meal puts the stomach in better condi- 
tion to digest the food that follows. Ice cream at the end 
of a meal is less likely to chill the stomach than at the be- 
ginning. Bread and butter afford a good combination of 
fat and carbohydrate. Crackers help in the breaking up of 
cheese into particles easy to digest. 

Not all of our eating habits are good, however. Griddle- 
cakes, melted butter, and maple sirup taste good, but the 
cakes make a pasty mass difiicult for digestive juices to pene- 
trate. The sirup is likely to ferment, and the butter coating 
the whole delays digestion greatly. Chicken salad is popu- 
lar, but combinations of protein with much fat (as in the 
mayonnaise dressing) always digest very slowly. Simple 
dishes, without rich sauces or gravies, and not excessively 
high in fat, are easiest of digestion. Pastries, fried foods, 
meats with much fat, like pork and sausage, are always more 
or less difiicult and should be attempted only by the strong, 
or when the body is free from physical or nervous wearmess, 
and not about to undertake mental work. 

Attention to the art of menu making not only helps to 
make the diet easier to digest, but also better balanced. 
Foods which are similar in color, flavor, and texture, like 
potatoes and rice, are not artistic in combination, and it is 
better to substitute for one of them a green vegetable, or 
meat or butter, in which case we get a better balance, as 
more a^h, protein, or fat would then be included with the 
starch of the rice or potato. 

In making the bill of fare it is a great mistake to consider 
each meal by itself alone. If we do so, some days are likely 
to be very high in fuel, while others may be very low. Then, 



310 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



too, the impression left from one meal carries over to the next. 
We do not care to see on the dinner table the same foods that 
we saw at luncheon. Our love of variety is one of nature's 
ways of seeing to it that we get different kinds of foodstuffs in 
our diet. Variety stimulates appetite, but this does not 
mean a great variety at one meal. The truest variety is ob- 
tained by a few well-selected dishes at each meal. If we do not 
exhaust our resources on one meal, wc shall be able to have a 
greater range of foods in the course of a week. A hotel may 
have fifty or sixty items on its bill of fare, but after a few days 
one feels as if there were a great sameness, because all of 
them are impressed on the mind at each meal and every day. 

Dietaries. — A dietary, as we shall use the term here,^ is 
a statement of the food requirements of a person or group of 
persons for a day or some other definite length of time, with 
a selection of foods to satisfy this requirement. 

The first part of a family dietary will have to be calculated 
according to the age, weight, and occupation, as stated on 
pages 299-303. When complete, it will stand somewhat like 
this :

^ Observations of the food eaten by individuals or groups of people are 
also called dietary studies, whether the observed dietary is such as to satisfy 
the food requirement or not. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 311 

In selecting food to satisfy these requirements it is a good 
plan to make first a list of those foods that need to be in- 
cluded in the day's dietary, no matter what the particular 
menu may be. This will include foods for growth where 
there are children, special dishes needed if any one is sick, 
and those common foods which we are accustomed to include 
in every day's menu, such as bread and butter. 

For the family which we are considering, this list will stand 
somewhat as follows : 

Food 100-Cai<orie Portions 

Milk 20 1 (6 for each child, the rest 

for the adults) 

Cereal 5 

Eggs (for children) 2 (counting I portion per egg) 

Fruit 5 

Green vegetable 2 

Meat or meat substitute .... 5 

Bread 15 

Butter 15 

This list is to be kept in planning the menu, whose char- 
acter is further determined by certain dishes which we wish 
particularly to have included. For instance, we may desire 
roast beef for dinner. This is a highly flavored meat, and a 
protein food which will go a long way towards satisfying the 
adult's protein needs. Special protein food for breakfast 
may well be omitted, or take the form of eggs, which are a 
contrast to the meat in flavor, form, etc. Protein food for 
luncheon might be fish or some other meat substitute. 

Vegetables for dinner should not only harmonize with the 
meat, but contrast pleasingly with each other. This result 
is insured by choosing one vegetable from the starchy type, 
as potatoes or sweet potatoes, and the other vegetable of the 
green or succulent group, as spinach or asparagus. 

Below are two menus, in which have been kept in mind the

we have well-balanced dietaries. Let us take, for example,

It is evident that we have enough protein, and as a good 
share of it is from milk, we know that it will satisfy the 
children's requirements in the best possible way. The adults 
will get theirs largely from the salmon and meat. Compar- 
ing this list with our first tentative one, we find that we 
have used in building up our dietary 21 portions of milk, 
5 of cereal, 5 of fruit (not including lemon juice), 4.1 of green 
vegetable, 8 of meat (including salmon), 18 of bread, and 22 
of butter, but no eggs. We have a good representation of the 
different kinds of foodstuffs, with this exception, and as the 
boys would need the eggs most, we could put them in for 
their breakfast, thus adding about 140 total Calories and 50 
protein Calories. With this addition we are still slightly 
deficient in total energy, but to add one or two hundred 
Calories is a very simple matter. A second serving of pota- 
toes, an extra roll for those whose fuel requirement is highest, 
or a slightly more liberal use of butter, might well solve the 
problem. This dietary calculation shows how the menu 
may help in getting a balanced diet, and how knowledge of 
food values can be applied as a check on the menu. If we 
had had fewer dishes in each meal, we should have had to 
plan to serve larger portions of some or all of them, or to use 
more freely such staples as bread, butter, and milk. 

Each family must find out the kind of menu best suited 
to its resources. Some typical meal plans suitable for 
everyday use are given below.

The cost of the dietary. — The types of menu used will 
depend very largely upon the income of the family. ' It is 
comparatively easy to plan attractive bills of fare if one does 
not have to consider the amount of work involved in prepar- 
ing them, or the cost of the materials to be used. With 
knowledge of food values an expensive dietary may be whole- 
some, but there is great temptation to overeating and waste 
of food, and it is wise to keep meals simple for the sake of 
good digestion. Most families have to consider carefully 
the cost of food if any money is to be saved for books or 
travel or emergencies. A dietary such as planned on page 
313 will probably cost from $1.50 to $2.00 for the day, or 
from 1^ to 2 cents per 100 Calories, depending on the locality. 
Nothing is allowed for waste, which may, if the cook and those 
who eat the food are not careful, amount to from 10 to 15 



316 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

per cent of the total cost. It is often estimated that the 
" average " man will consume about 3000 Calories per day, 
and the cost may be expressed on this basis as from 45 to 
60 cents per man per day ; or the dietary spoken of as a 45- 
cent or 60-cent dietary or whatever the exact cost per 3000 
Calories may be. The cost of food for such a family for a 
year would at this rate be from $550 to $750. 

If the allowance for food be placed at 25 per cent of the 
total income/ this dietary would be appropriate for a family 
with an income of $2200 to $3000 per year. The majority 
of families have to get along with a lower expenditure for 
food, yet they want to be well nourished and to enjoy their 
fare.. Fortunately there is no real connection between cost 
and nutritive value, some of the most nutritious foods being 
among the cheapest. At the same time, we cannot get 
wholesome food for nothing. There are very few foods which 
to-day cost less than ^ of a cent per 100 Calories, and these 
are mostly cereal products, such as cornmeal, rolled oats, 
and flour, or sugars and molasses. These alone will not 
make *a well-balanced, palatable dietary, though they will 
supply all the fuel needed for an " average " man for a day 
for ten cents. In many parts of the country to-day it is 
hardly possible to make a dietary satisfactory week in and 
week out with an average allowance of less than f of a cent 
per 100 Calories, and even this sum will prove satisfactory 
only provided there be skill in food preparation as well as 
food selection. With an allowance of 1 cent per 100 Calories 
it is possible almost anywhere to make a balanced dietary 
with some attractiveness in appearance and flavor. In 

1 The apportionment of the income to the different expenses of living 
(food, clothing, shelter, etc.) is discussed in Chapter XIX. It will be found 
that the smaller the income the higher is the percentage of it which must 
be allowed for food.

choosing foods with regard to cost a table that shows which 
are cheap fuel and which dear, is a great help. Prices vary 
so much with place and season that it is difficult to make 
one which is very exact, and some rearrangement to suit 
any particular region may be necessary. The table on page 
317 will, however, serve as a guide. 

Inspection of this table shows that if we can afford only 
one cent per 100 Calories for food, we must get a large share 
from Group I, and a few from Group II ; if we wish to use 
foods in Group III, we shall have to do so sparingly, or offset 
them with some of the very cheapest in Group I, to keep the 
average as we wish it. 

When we plan an attractive menu and find it is too ex- 
pensive for us, we may often carry out our plan bysubstitut- 
mg cheaper foods of the same sort. Thus in the dietary on 
page 313 we may substitute as follows : 

Bananas for oranges. 

Top milk for cream. 

Oleomargarine for a part of the butter. 

Bean loaf with tomato sauce for creamed salmon and peas. 

Stewed apricots for pears. 

Rump roast instead of rib roast. 
Doing this, omitting the soup and crackers and the salad 
for dinner, and increasing bread and potatoes, flaked wheat, 
and other cheaper foods to prevent any deficiency in fuel, 
we can still prepare palatable and digestible meals with the 
right food values, and save perhaps 25 per cent on the total 
cost for the day. 

Feeding the sick. — When illness is serious enough for a 
physician to be consulted, he will give directions concerning 
the diet, and these should be scrupulously followed. If the 
case is so severe as to demand a trained nurse, she will have 
charge of the feeding, under the physician's guidance. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 319 

Many times, however, a member of the family is temporarily 
indisposed and needs food different from the ordinary family 
bill of fare. It is well to remember that in the first day or 
two of illness, fasting or taking of very little food does no 
harm, and may be an excellent help toward recovery, as it 
gives the digestive tract a chance to rest, if it has been 
disturbed. 

Nevertheless, the internal work of the body goes on, 0.4 
Calorie per pound per hour being expended during sleep, and 
about 0.6 Calorie per pound per hour during waking hours 
in bed. A person in bed for twenty-four hours will require 
about 0.5 Calorie per pound per hour to prevent use of body 
material for fuel. A man of average weight, lying in bed, 
will thus need about 1850 calories per day. Hence we must 
see to it, that after a person has been sick for more than a 
few days (during which he can afford to burn body fat) enough 
fuel is given to satisfy his energy requirements if he can pos- 
sibly digest it. 

Food for an invalid must always be given in its most diges- 
tible forms. Milk is one of the most valuable foods in sick- 
ness, not only because it supplies so many body needs, but 
because it can be used in so many ways, — hot, or cold, 
flavored or plain, made into junkets or sherbets, combined 
with eggs in eggnogs and custards, fermented as in kumyss 
or soured as in buttermilk or zoojak. In some form or other 
milk can almost always be made digestible. Eggs are also 
of great value, not only poached or dropped and served on 
toast, but as dainty omelets, or in beverages, as eggnog, egg 
lemonade, and orangeade. Mild fruit juices, as orange, 
grape, or pineapple, are not only refreshing but of considerable 
fuel value. If there is no fever, chicken, lamb chops, tender 
broiled steak or roast beef may serve to add variety to the 
menu. Broths stimulate the appetite and help digestion, 



320 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

though they are of little or no food value themselves. Cereals, 
eggs, and milk may be added to increase their food value. 
Cereals in the form of gruels or delicate puddings, as corn- 
starch blancmange and tapioca cream, are easily digested. 
Vegetables are best given rather sparingly, and only delicate, 
mild-flavored ones, such as spinach or asparagus, if digestion 
is much disturbed. In getting an invalid to take sufficient 
food, much depends upon the attractiveness of the service. 
Remember that very little things, like a fingermark on a 
glass, or coffee spilled into the saucer, may take away appetite 
and prevent enough food being eaten. Food in small quan- 
tities and taken at more frequent intervals than in health 
helps towards the best results. Knowledge of what particular 
diet is best in different diseases comes only through careful 
study of the science of nutrition after much study of chem- 
istry and physiology.

CHAPTER XIX 
THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 

The divisions of the income for which we should provide 
are food, shelter, including taxes and operating expenses, 
clothing, and the " higher life," including recreation, educa- 
tion, and savings. The size of the income determines largely 
the proportion of money allotted to each division. We 
must be nourished and protected from the elements by shel- 
ter and clothing, and an income must at least provide for these 
necessities to be a living wage. Yet we justly claim some- 
thing more from our income than mere existence. 

In most famiUes there is a fairly definite income. When 
the amount is not known it is wise to estimate upon the 
minimimi income and have a surplus, rather than to expend 
too much. Seventy-five years ago things cost less and in- 
comes were less, to-day the incomes have increased and cost 
of living is growing higher. The question is one to be 
studied relatively, and the cost of living will depend on the 
ratio between income and one's methods of living. 

Just what other satisfactions than the merely physical 
are to be gratified is the great question for the woman who 
divides the income. The problem is naturally hardest with 
the smallest income, where the " must be '' crowds out the 
" may be." But there is room for choice even with the small 
wage. 

This work of dividing the income and deciding on the ideals 

should be shared by the family. When the home is first 

started the husband and wife should discuss frankly the prob- 
T 321 



322 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

lems of division and should agree on the methods of expen- 
.diture. This common understanding between members of a 
family forms a bond of union, and each feels a greater pleas- 
ure and pride in doing his part. The fact that there is a 
budget and a system brings orderliness in methods of work 
and freedom from worry and anxiety as well as a saving of 
money. And this saving of money and strength is the same 
as an increase in income. This budget or division of ex- 
penses acts as a sailing chart and can be referred to from 
month to month. It should not, however, become a burden, 
and one should not worry if every penny is not accounted for. 

Statisticians tell us that about 75 per cent of the male 
adults of our country earn somewhat less than $600 a year. 
That in large cities $900 to $1000 a year is necessary to bring 
up a family to live decently and enjoy human happiness. 
Much depends upon how this income is divided as to whether 
results will tend to develop eflScienoy in the members of such 
a family. As the income increases from $1000 to $5000 it is 
possible to apportion the income and indicate certain per- 
centages which represent wise family expenditures so as to 
include the higher intellectual and emotional life as well as 
the physical welfare of the family. 

From comparison of many budgets statisticians have 
worked out certain percentages that are helpful in making 
our decisions, although they are not to be taken as fixed rules. 

Expenditure for food. — On examining the budgets of 
families having incomes from $500 to $5000, it is found that 
the percentage spent for food increases as the income de- 
creases, amounting sometimes to at least 50 per cent of the in- 
come. This means that there is a limit to the money spent 
per capita per day for food, below which we cannot go and 
maintain life with even sufficient efficiency for unskilled labor. 
Figure 77 shows that a $900 income gives about 45 per cent to 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 323 

food. An expenditure of thirty cents per capita per day for 
food in a family of five with an income of $1500, is 36.5 per 
cent; i.e. more than one third of the total income. Sug-

324 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

come, and highly important with the larger where we are prone 
to yield to a foolish impulse to please a whim of the palate. 

Expenditure for shelter. — The increased cost of building 
and the general advance in rentals make the expenditure for 
shelter a large one. 

The question whether homes should be owned or rented is 
a vital one. Ownership is possible for comparatively few, 
but there is probably nothing that contributes more to the 
upbuilding of a community and the development of good 
citizenship than the permanent residence of families in 
localities. The pride of the members is enlisted in the home, 
its surroundings and general community welfare. This 
sense of ownership makes a house more sl home although real 
home spirit is not confined to ownership of buildings. There 
are of course advantages and disadvantages of ownership, 
and these should be carefully weighed. Preference for fresh 
air, more space, less crowded conditions even if they necessi- 
tate daily travel, have driven people of limited incomes and 
certain ideals from the crowded cities to the suburbs in search 
of homes. When it is possible it is certainly much more 
advantageous to own than to rent a home, when living means 
the attainment of certain ideals in the lives of the members of 
the family. 

In deciding upon the proper expenditure, we must take 
into account the location, whether convenient to business, 
school, and church, sanitary conditions in surroundings and 
in the house or apartment, the appearance of the house and 
the attractiveness of the neighborhood as well as its con- 
venience and healthfulness. The house should be adapted 
to the needs of the family and selected with this thought in 
mind. See the companion volume, ''Shelter and Clothing," 
Chapters II and III. 

It has been estimated that 20 per cent of incomes ranging 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 325 

from $500 to $5000 will secure a home, not including operat- 
ing expenses, with the proper sanitary conditions and one 
which will contribute to a right standard of living. If neces- 
sary to secure healthful surroundings more than 20 per cent 
may need to be spent, but 25 per cent of the income is the 
limit of the amount to be spent upon rent unless this also 
includes heat (as in many apartments) when as much as 
28 per cent may be so spent. If more than this is paid, it is 
practically impossible to avoid debt when any unforeseen 
contingency arises. One thrifty German woman used 30 
per cent of the small family income for rent, in order to have 
more bedrooms than most tenement-house dwellers can 
afford. She did make ends meet by working until midnight 
at the family sewing, and tailoring ; but though she was the 
very soul of thrift in regard to food, and had never called 
in a doctor, she could not save money until the children 
began to earn. 

Operating expenses. — The question of operating expense 
is closely associated with the selection of shelter and should 
be carefully considered with it in the division of the income. 
They are the expenses necessary to keep the house clean, 
warm, lighted, insured, and in constant repair. To these 
must be added in a suburban community water tax, property 
tax, perhaps even a fire tax. 

In city apartments, heat and hot water are often furnished, 
and this must be taken into account in deciding between 
apartment and house, and between renting and ownership. 

Labor is an important item in the running of the house. 
The close connection of selecting and operating a home will 
be seen. Should the administrator divide the family income 
in such a way that little is left for operating, the little things 
of everyday life become a constant source of worry. 

The questions of the number of rooms, and their care, 



326 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

relative expense of heating by furnace, steam, or hot water, 
the cost of regular service in wages per week in order to 
attain one's ideals, the cost of extra service, the lighting by 
gas, oil, or electricity are all problems of operating. Knowl- 
edge of sanitary science will make the homemaker demand 
cleanliness in her surroundings, quick disposal of waste, and 
the prompt removal of dust. Much care in planning is 
necessary here in order that there may be no leakage and that 
there may be the full share of comfort for each member. 

For the. income of from $500 to $5000 it has been estimated 
that a proportion of from 10 to 20 per cent must usually be 
spent for operating in order to secure comfort. Much must 
necessarily depend upon the amount of hired service required, 
which, in turn, depends largely upon whether the homemaker 
is to give her time chiefly to the care of her children or chiefly 
to the conduct of the housework. 

Clothing. — A large proportion of the family income is 
spent on clothing. A knowledge of textiles and of purchasing 
is necessary in order to do this wisely and economically. 
Clothing is as necessary an expense as food, for it con- 
serves the heat which the food furnishes and thus main- 
tains body temperature. Health is the main factor in 
efficiency, and health is preserved by clothing which protects 
the body from sudden changes in temperatures, and con- 
serves the energy for other purposes. Money should be 
spent on clothing to secure health, but too often more than 
the right percentage of income is expended because of love 
of display. The instinct for show, color, ornamentation 
is a primitive one, and the aesthetic '' want '' is, in one sense, 
as real as the physical and should be considered in expendi- 
tures for this purpose. It is a duty to look well, but it is not 
necessary, nor does it show good sense, to sacrifice the health, 
happiness, and higher life of the family by economizing on 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 327 

food and other essentials in order to secure hats, shoes, gowns, 
and accessories that cater to a mania for show. If the in- 
come be limited so that the essentials of clothing only can 
be purchased, the margin of income which can be spent for 
pleasure may, if taste so dictates, be spent on clothing instead 
of pictures, books, or some recreation. That is a matter for 
the individual or family to decide. In the typical budgets 
cited below it will be seen that the expenditure for clothing 
was usually between 10 and 18 per cent. 

The higher life. — There are other needs of family life 
for which money must be spent besides the material ones of 
food, shelter, and clothing. In the division of some family 
incomes little thought is given to this phase of living. After 
the income reaches a certain amoimt, it is possible so to plan 
that education, recreation, philanthropy, and savings all 
figure in the division of expenditures. Some writers say 
that 25 per cent of the income of $1000 to $5000 sjiould be 
spent in this way. If thought is given to this, it would mean 
opportimities for books, periodicals, lectures, and member- 
ship in societies; some travel and vacation, social clubs, 
theaters and concerts; charity and church expenditures; 
life insurance and other savings. It is the idea of ownership 
of property, of homes, of possessions of all kinds that has 
led from primitive living to advanced civilization. And 
with advanced civilization comes the need for the higher life 
which should be satisfied and can be through wise division 
of fimds. The choice of things to satisfy this higher life rests 
with the individual ; it may be music, it may be the culti- 
vation of altruistic feeling in the help given to neighbors ; 
it may be a bank account for some future good, or money 
spent on excursions, lectures, or theater. Whatever it is, it 
satisfies the emotional, spiritual, and intellectual life of man 
and distinguishes him as one of advanced civilization. 



328 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Savings. — Something should be saved yearly even if at 
.first it is but little. Small amounts put away regularly in a 
savings bank moimt up to a considerable sum at compound 
interest, for regular saving is the only kind that counts. Life 
and sickness insurance are other forms of saving. 

Allowances. — Each member of the family should have a 
personal allowance, even though it is small. One mother 
gave each of her children five cents a week, beginning at five 
years of age, and increasing a cent a week each year, until they 
were old enough to be trusted with more. Even at this age 
opposite characteristics showed themselves. One boy saved 
his allowance until he had a quarter to spend at one time ; 
another was in debt before the end of the week. Each had 
a bank, and kept accounts, as well. It is sometimes better 
for a child if he " earns '' his allowances by performance of 
such household duties as seem best adapted to promote his 
development. 

Suggested and typical budgets. — In preparation for the 
division of one's income it is helpful to study the budgets of 
other families or individuals. Mrs. Richards in her book on 
" The Cost of Living " gives a theoretical division of in- 
comes, which is shown in the accompanying table headed 
Suggested Budgets. It is interesting to study this account 
and then those of families who have worked out their prob- 
lems (either with or without the preparation of definite 
budgets in advance) as shown in the table of Tjrpical 
Budgets. 

In New York City it has been estimated by those studying 
the problems of the cost of living of to-day that it is im- 
possible for the average family of mother, father, and three 
children imder 14 years to get food enough to keep the 
body in good condition with clothing and shelter to meet 
the most urgent demands of decency for less than $900. 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 



329 



This amount in other localities would probably buy more. 
This means that in New York City for $900 a family of five 
can have a very bare existence, ^.nd that with $1000 this 
family can begin to maintain a decent standard of living 
imless there is long sickness or other catastrophe. At $1200 
a normal family standard can be maintained so as to preserve 
health, and so that the family will have opportunities to 
develop in a self-respecting manner. When one con- 
siders that many families subsist on $500 or $600 a year, 
it is necessarily under conditions of shelter* and with 
limitations of food and clothing, not conducive to the best 
development.

CHAPTER XX 
SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT ^ 

The housekeeper should learn to use the labor-saving de- 
vices for her records that are now employed so largely in the 
world of business. This equipment should include a desk 
with fittings for systematized and rapid work. A roll-top 
desk, with pigeonholes and drawers is convenient, but a flat- 
topped desk with drawers below gives a larger space for 
writing, although it has to be supplemented by boxes to take 
the place of pigeonholes. Such desks may be purchased for 
twenty dollars and upward, in woods to match other furni- 
ture. It is a pleasure to have artistic desk furnishings, but a 
large amount may be spent on these, and the desk still be un- 
equipped for practical purposes. 

Files and loose-leaf books. — A card file is as advantageous 
to the housekeeper as to the business man. Some desks 
contain a place for the card file in the upper right-hand drawer. 

Guide cards are furnished in several colors to indicate 
divisions of the file, and these are plain, or with printed 
nmnbers and letters. The record cards also are made of 
several colors, to indicate different uses. The suggestions 
here cover only a few of the possibilities. Visit some office 
furnishing department or shop to see what an array of con- 
veniences has been devised for the dispatch of business. If 
you once form the habit, you will find new uses for the card 
file almost daily, and will keep on the cards, addresses, en- 
gagements, cash accounts, shopping lists, inventories of 

332 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 333 

clothing and furnishings, menus and recipes. A loose-leaf 
book is preferred by some people for inventories and accounts. 

A letter file shaped like a pocketbook can be purchased for 
only twenty-five cents, and will serve the purpose for a small 
correspondence. Large files with guide cards are made for a 
larger correspondence. 

The small file will answer for filing bills and is useful also 
for chppings. Some desks have bill files in the pigeonholes, 
and a letter file in one of the large drawers. 

Have regular hours daily for attending to work at the 
(desk, stated times for planning menus, making shopping 
lists, looking over the inventories, recording expenditures, 
and balancing accounts. 

Order in time and place are studied further in the chapter 
on Housewifery. , 

Keeping of accounts. — This has been called by many, 
drudgery and tedious routine. Many business men go 
through much such drudgery to attain their goals, why should 
not the housewife be willing to make a similar sacrifice in 
her home for the sake of the service she is rendering the 
members of her household ? The aim in keeping the accounts 
is to register the amounts spent for various purposes so that 
all phases of life will be considered and so that the manager 
will be able to profit the second year because of the expe- 
rience of the first year. This makes housekeeping interesting 
and businesslike. The expenditure is made to produce the 
maximum of value received and is accompanied by the 
greatest possible pleasure. 

In keeping accounts there should be some method of show- 
ing the receipts and expenses, the income and the outgo, so 
that a balance can be made at any time. The items should 
be so listed, too, that it is possible to tell what expenditure 
has been made for any one item, as rent, or food, or other 



334 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

necessities. It is only in this way that the accounts become 
of value for future use. 

There are many ways of keeping such accounts. The 
simplest one for the housewife is the best if it shows the 
points mentioned above. The envelope system is used by 
some when the income is small, and a certain amount of 
money according to budget plan is put in labeled en- 
velopes for various purposes, as rent, food, operating ex- 
penses, etc. As sums are drawn from the various envelopes, 
a slip of paper put in the particular envelope registers the 
amount drawn. It is easy at the end of the month to balance 
the accounts. This system necessitates the presence of a 
good deal of money on hand, and sometimes of confusion of 
accounts, if money is borrowed from one envelope for use 
in anothef . 

Various systems of card catalogues, journals, and ledgers 
are in use, and all have more or less value. The simplest form 
for the average yoimg woman or housewife can be kept in 
an ordinary blank book and the spaces ruled according to 
one's need. The account book can be started in somewhat 
the following manner, with the dates of expenditures in the 
first coliunn and the respective amounts opposite under their

proper heads. In this way it is possible by using double 
pages of the blank book to keep all the items for each month 
in horizontal series. The colunms for ivems of expenses 
should be ruled as needed, but it is desirable to keep them 
under as few heads as will suffice to give the information 
which may be desired. The use of the double page is ad- 
visable, for then the outer edge of the left-hand page can be 
used for the dates of purchase and plenty of room for columns 
of expense left across the two pages. The total in the various 
columns can be easily calculated at the end of the first month 
and a new set of pages ruled for the second. The expendi- 
tures should be entered daily so as not to be forgotten. A 
slip of paper kept in one's purse is of help if amounts are 
jotted down while one is shopping. The totals for each 
month should be entered in another part of the blank book. 
Rule spaces for the year with columns for the months across 
the page and items of expense corresponding to those in the 
daily entry at the left-hand side. In this way at the end of 
twelve months the totals for each item of expense can be easily 
found. If one desires to know from day to day of a month 
how the balance stands, it is possible to add to Form I two 
columns for this purpose. One column should show the in-

the expense of each item across the page for the day and 
entering in the expense column. 

Somewhere in the book there should be kept an account 
of the receipts from all sources. The balance of the yearly 
expense account with the sheet of receipt can be easily made. 

Some plan must be made for showing which purchases are 
paid for in cash, and which are charged. A simple method 
is to record the articles charged, with the place, date, and 
price on a card in the card file in a division kept for this pur- 
pose, and labeled '' Purchases charged." When the bill is 
rendered, it can be checked up from these cards, and the 
purchases entered in the permanent account book. The 
record in the account book gives thus the date of payment,

but not the date of purchase, unless this is added too. The 
date of purchase can be recorded in the inventory of housed 
hold goods (see Chapter XXII). 

This simple method of keeping accounts enables one to 
look over the monthly and yearly expenses and to see if the 
expenditure is apportioned to the dififerent divisions as it 
should be. If some of the needs of the physical or intellectual 
life are being neglected, it should be possible to cut down or 
readjust the next year to the satisfaction both of the house- 
wife and of her family. 

It is wise for all girls before they have homes of their own 

to keep account of their own small incomes. In many 

families daughters are given money for clothing and daily 

expenses. Some such system of keeping accounts as the 

above can be used. It is astonishing in examining ao- 
z 



338 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

counts for clothing, to see how few maintain a correct balance. 
One girl found, by keeping accounts, that she spent entirely 
too much for hats and gloves and did not have the proper 
underwear to protect her body and maintain the correct 
temperature for health. Accounts help us to determine 
whether our methods of living measure up to the ideals or 
standards of life which we have established in order to live 
rightly. 

Methods of payment. — Pajonent is either immediate, 
known as " spot cash,'' or deferred. If deferred, the articles 
purchased are charged by the dealer, and a bill rendered the 
first of each month. When a charge account is opened, a 
good business reference must be given. According to another 
system, articles may be paid for in installments, — that is, 
so much each month, according to some agreement. Of 
this method it may be said that it is unsafe, or at least 
unwise, always. Remember that more is always paid in 
the end. 

In either case the payment may be made in bills, specie, 
t)r by checks; although in ordinary shopping inmiediate 
payment is usually made in bills and specie. 

The advantage of immediate payment is that the buyer 
spends only what she has, and does not count on future 
money. This method of payment enables one to keep the 
balance well in hand. It necessitates, however, keeping 
bills and specie in the house, and in one's pocketbook, with 
the possibility of theft or loss ; , and cash payment takes more 
time in the shop, with the long wait for change. Sending 
" collect on deliyery " (C.O.D.) is a way of making cash 
payment and saving time at the shop. Be sure that in this 
case there is the exact change at home, and some one ready to 
receive the goods. 

Charging goods makes for economy of time. If you can 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 339 

remember that an article charged means money spent, this is 
a safe plan. One careful buyer says that she is too optimistic 
to have a charge account; too sure that while she has not 
cash enough to-day for something that she wants, she will 
surely have it by the first of next month. 

There is another method of payment introduced by a few 
large department stores. The firm requires a monthly de- 
posit at the first of each month and charges up purchases 
against this. This is good in so far that the customer is 
spending money that he really has, but it restricts purchases 
to that one shop, and this is inadvisable in the case of a small 
income. 

The bank account and check book. — Whether payment 
.is immediate or deferred, payment by check is a great con- 
venience. It saves time and is also a record of money paid. 

Select a bank, conveniently located, and recommended by 
a conservative business man. Take to the bank a letter of 
introduction, with the siun for deposit. The bank will 
record your signature, and give yqu a bank book in which is 
recorded the amount deposited. A check book will be given 
you that contains blank checks, and provides for keeping ac- 
count of deposits and checks drawn. Each check has to 
be filled in, and signed with your name exactly as recorded at 
the bank, when you make a payment. This must be re- 
corded in the proper place when the check is made out, stating 
date, amount, and payee. The sums paid out are added, 
usually for every three checks, and this siun deducted from 
the deposit, and the balance carried forward. In this way 
you may always know your balance in the bank, provided 
you are accurate. Great care must be taken to fill in the 
blank spaces correctly so that the check cannot be easily 
altered by any one. 

If a check is made out to you, and you wish to cash it, or 



340 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

deposit it, you " indorse " it by writing your aame on the 
back across the left-hand end of the check. The name must 
be written exactly as it appears on the face of the check. 
If by chance the name is misspelled, write it in with the cor- 
rect spelling below. 

The checks that you make out are indorsed by the payee 
in the same way, and cannot be cashed until so indorsed. 
Therefore, if a check is lost in the mail, you do not lose the 
money. The bank should be notified to " stop pajonent " 
on the lost check, and you can then send another check in 
place of the first one. 

When you wish bills or specie, you go to the bank and 
present to the paying teller a check made out to " Cash " 
and signed by yourself. It is wise not to make out or sign 
such a check until you reach the bank, because if such a 
check is lost on the way, there is danger of its being cashed 
by the finder. 

Once a month you should leave the book with the teller 
to be balanced. In a few days you may call for it, and will 
receive with it the checks that you have drawn, and that have 
been returned to the bank by the date to which the book is 
balanced. These checks are called vouchers. With these 
there is also a Ust of the amounts showing the total paid out 
on them by the bank. Check up the vouchers with the list, 
then check up the vouchers with your check book to see if 
all in your check book had been returned to the bank by the 
date of balancing. If there are some still out, add that 
sum to your check book balance, and then compare the bank 
book balance with your check book. 

Deposits may be sent by mail, either with or without the 
check book. If the book is sent, it should go by registered 
mail. If you do not send the book, the bank will send a 
receipt, which you return with the book the next time the 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 341 

balance is made. In either case, write " For deposit " above 
your signature on the back.

CHAPTER XXI 
HOW TO BUY 

The first rule in good buying is to know standard quality 
in your intended purchase, for then you need not be depend- 
ent upon the salesman. The second is to know your own 
needs, that you may not be beguiled by the clever advertise- 
ment in the daily paper, or the well-displayed bargain, and 
will not need to ask the salesman's advice about quantity. 
Keep lists of articles needed in the card file, and make your 
shopping lists from these. The third rule is to apportion 
your purchases to your income and the divisions of your 
budget. 

Where to buy. — Patronize reliable firms. There are in 
any community shops of different grades, and you will not 
find the best return for your money always at those houses 
where there is the greatest parade of cut prices and bargains. 
In the end the reliable places are the cheapest. Sometimes a 
firm trades on its reputation and a degree of fashion it has 
attained, but on the whole it is true that if one house has 
goods uniformly cheaper than another, it is because the 
quality is inferior. 

One fact that a good shopper learns is this — that certain 
articles may be purchased to greater advantage at one place 
than another. One firm excels in silks, another in household 
linen, another in coffee, and so on. 

Almost every community now has a *' white list " and a 

branch of the Consumers' League, the significance of which 

was explained in *' Shelter and Clothing," p. 202. 

342 



HOW TO BUY 343 

How to shop. — Know the shops you patronize, first by 
personal inspection, unless, of course, you are ordering from 
a distance. 

Mail orders and the telephone are helps to the buyer. 
These should not entirely take the place of personal visits 
to the shops, but, if well used, save many weary hours. The 
parcel post makes possible buying by mail even perishable 
articles direct from the producer. Many country dwellers 
do a large part of their shopping even for clothing and fur- 
niture by mail, and there are reputable firms who cater largely 
to this trade, and send out well-illustrated price lists as guides. 
However, this method should be used very cautiously, and 
it may be unsatisfactory for articles where the aesthetic 
element is important, as well as the quality. 

Bargains, sales, and advertisements. — Here the buyer 
matches her wit against the wiles of the seller. Bargain 
sales may be made up of sweat shop goods. Many women 
ignorant of textile production, flock to the sales of materials 
and garments, helping the storekeeper to dispose of silk 
which is rotting on his shelves, or garments which have 
been poorly or cheaply constructed and which go to pieces 
the first time laundered. Remnants are often cut from 
materials on the regular shelves, and sometimes are offered at 
an advance in price at the so-called bargain sales. In reliable 
shops one can sometimes find bargains during clearance sales. 
It pays to wait and buy out of season, as much can be saved 
in this way. A '' best '' hat in January, or a white dress in 
August, may often be purchased to advantage. In order to 
do this, one must plan the wardrobe systematically. 

Trading stamps and prizes. — Remember that nothing is 
given away, and that you pay for everything that you receive. 
It is well to deal with a firm that sells standard goods at 
standard prices. A discount is sometimes allowed for cash. 



344 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Buying on installments. — Methods of payment are dis- 
cussed in Chapter XX. The instalhnent plan is important to 
consider, since it is so conmion for people of small means. 
How tempting for a young couple, who have no savings, to 
furnish the new home in this way? It is a " gambUng on 
futures,'' however, as much as are some methods in the 
Stock Exchange. If the income stops, because the position 
is lost, or if sickness comes, and the installments cannot be 
paid, the whole outfit may be lost. There have been real 
household tragedies of this kind. The better way is to save 
until a small amount of simple furniture can be purchased 
outright. The installment method is also used by estabhshed 
firms of sound reputation to tempt one to buy the latest 
enc3'^clop8edia, or the new musical instrument, or some other 
much-desired possession. This is safe if one is absolutely 
sure of a fixed future income ; but here again it is better to 
save first and buy outright. You may say that the install- 
ment plan gives the use of the encyclopaedia at once, and 
this is true. But if you have the saving habit, there will 
already be a fund on which to draw. 

The ethics of shopping. — There is no greater test of good 
breeding and kindness than the tour of a crowded shop; 
and sometimes the silken thread is strained to the snapping 
point. Remember that tired human beings are at the counter. 

Time your shopping that you may not help to crowd busi- 
ness at the closing hour. If the shop closes at five, leave 
several minutes before the hour. As a matter of fact it is 
only to the shopper that the shop closes at the stated hour; 
some of the hardest work of the day comes after hours. 
Avoid shopping at the luncheon hour, and on Saturday after- 
noon at the time of the week when the salespeople are most 
tired. This is also a hard time for dehvery men and boys. 
Consult here the pamphlets of the Consumers' League. 



HOW TO BUY 345 

In times of stress, the shopkeeper asks you to carry small 
bundles home with you, and this you should cheerfully do. 
Some women carry the C.O.D. privilege to an extreme, or- 
dering in this way with the intention of sending certain 
articles back, thus creating much unnecessary labor. 

Purchasing of clothing and household textiles. — Experi- 
ence is a good teacher, but knowledge so gained is, Often paid 
for at high price. It seems an easier way, with much saving 
of time, money, and energy, for girls to learn beforehand 
what to guard against in purchasing their household textiles 
for both clothing and furnishings. Our great-grandmothers 
were sure their household textiles would wear, for they fol- 
lowed every step of their manufacture and knew they were 
durable and honest. Conditions changed with the factory 
system of manufacture, and to-day women know very little^ 
about textile fabrics or the making of garments. This 
ignorance of manufacturing processes results in the increased 
cost of living by the wasteful expenditures made for house- 
hold textiles. Women rely on the information given by 
clerks in stores, often to their sad disadvantage. As we have 
learned, about 15 to 20 per cent of the family income is usu- 
ally spent on clothing and household furnishings for a family 
of four. Is it not necessary then that girls should learn to 
make the dollars earned buy just as much as possible? 

There is need of a pure textile law in order that the adul- 
terations of textiles may be defined. Some of us cannot 
afford to buy pure hnen or all wool, but we do wish to know 
the percentage of adulterant in order that we may judge 
whether the materials will meet our needs. It is beyond the 
power of women now to control the making of fabrics, and 
the government, therefore, must help to maintain standards 
and proper supervision of textile labehng. Women can, 
however, study this problem, and with a knowledge of the 



346 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

I 

manufacture and composition of textiles will come the powei 
to choose wisely, for manufacturers have been able to per- 
petuate these frauds chiefly because of ignorance. (See the 
companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing.") 

Some things to remember in purchasing household linens, 

1. Design is important. French designs are the most beautiful 
in damasksf Scotch and Irish are good, and German patterns per- 
haps the least attractive. Weave often affects the wearing quality 
of linen as well as the appearance. The satin stripes and long 
threads on surface are apt to wear off quickly and they are some- 
times introduced to cover defects beneath. Ttey cannot stand 
heavy ironing as the closer, more even, weaves. 

2. Linen is sometimes adulterated with cotton; if bought as 
imion goods one may expect it. If bought for pure linen, ravel the 
material and untwist warp and woof threads. Do the threads 
appear long and lustrous ? The round threads are best. If cotton 
has been used, the ends will fly apart and fuzz, if linen they will 
appear more parallel and pointed at the ends when separated. 
The cheaper *' all linens '* are sometimes made from the tow or 
short refuse. If the fiber is short, it will not last as well as the long. 
Moistening with the finger was an old-fashioned test. A better 
one is to use a drop of olive oil. This test must be made at home. 
Water spreads more rapidly on linen than on cotton. The oil 
makes the linen fibers more translucent than cotton. 

3. Cost is a guide. Linen is expensive. Is the price that 
which should insure a good article? If cheap, beware. 

4. Feel the cloth. Is it cold and does it feel rather heavy when 
crushed in the hand? Many buyers in department stores judge 
by weight. In piurchasing table linen less than 4i oz. to the square 
yard is not worth buying. Above that it improves. Reliable 
firms will tell the weight. Custom house inspectors judge by the 
picks or throws of woof to the inch. 

5. Notice the finish. Is it full of starch and sizing which can 
be picked off? If so, in washing that will all disappear, leaving a 
loosely woven instead of a smooth satiny surface. Calendering 
and beetling make the material smooth and lustrous and reduce 
the thickness. Do not be deceived. It is better to buy a soft 
linen than one stiff with starch which wiU crack. 



HOW TO BUY 347 

6. In buying table linen the goods received in December and 
January are apt to be the bleach of the previous summer. Remem- 
ber that poor bleaching affects the wearing quality. One can 
sometimes tell by tearing a sample. 

For quality, beauty, and variety of patterns, Scotch, French, and 
Irish linens are the best. German damask is excellent. The 
unbleached will wear much longer, is less expensive, and is bought 
by many housewives and bleached as used. 

Damask by the yard for tablecloths is slightly cheaper. Table- 
cloths from 2J to 3 yards are good size for a medium family of five 
or six. One dollar a yard is a fair price for everyday linen. The 
cloth should about equal 1 dozen napkins in cost, and a cloth will 
usually wear as long as 1} to 2 dozen napkins. Napkins come in 
three sizes, f , 17-22 inches ; f , 23-27 inches ; J, 29-31 inches. 

7. For family towels, huckaback is the most serviceable, 
although damask is used a great deal (see Fig. 78). linen 
towels vary in price from three dollars a dozen up, according to 
size and quality. Dish towels of linen crash are very serviceable. 

8. Bedding. Sheets can be purchased ready made in linen 
or cotton in various sizes. If they are to be made at home, buy 
sheeting that can be obtained for single, two thirds, or fuU-sized 
bed. If cotton, buy in bleached or unbleached condition. Purchase 
sheets which are long enough to fold over at the top and protect 
the blankets. There are several good brandy of cotton sheeting. 
" Fruit of the Loom *' is one of the best known. 

Tubing for pillow cases may also be bought. It has no seams, 
and comes in several widths. 

9. It is better to purchase a certain amount of new linen annually 
and gradually supplement that worn than to wait and have all 
wear out at once. 

Some things to remember in purchasing silk* 

1. That pure silk is seldom manufactured. It is nearly always 
weighted, and a large proportion of weighting is to be guarded 
against, as it weakens the wearing quality. Up to 30 per cent is 
not harmful and helps the silk to take the dye. The fact that it is 
heavy in the hand does not always mean that it is a good piece of 
material and will wear well — the weight may be due to artificial 
** weighting " and not silk. Choose rather a softer pliable silk. 



348 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



HOW TO BUY 349 

2. Try the test for strength with the thumb (see ** Shelter and 
Clothing/* page 199) to see if the warp and woof threads are equally 
strong, or stronger one way than the other. If the latter, it will 
not wear well. 

3. Fray out the threads. Do they break easily ? If so, the silk 
is not of good quality. If the warp threads are weak, the silk will 
split across, if the woof is weak, the silk dress will go in ribbons. 

4. If you have time before purchasing, test a sample of silk by 
burning. Place in a porcelain dish and heat gently for thirty 
minutes. The silk will vanish and the weighting remain. 

Burn the threads to see if there is cotton in warp or woof. Burn 
end of sample. If it is the same shape after burned, it is probably 
weighted. 

5. Close weaves wear better than more loosely woven ones and 
soft silks better than stiff. Guard against buying soft silks, how- 
ever, that are so woven as to pull in the seams when worn. 

6. Are you buying material made of reeled or spun silk? Bar- 
gains are seldom found at silk sales. Should you expect to find 
pure silk at 50 or 60 cents a yard or as many yards of silk thread 
B as A on a spool? Remember that the demand for a cheap 
product means the production of cheap products. Wear something 
else rather than cheap silks. 

7. Is the silk adulterated with mercerized cotton or artificial 
silk? Try the tests. (See " Shelter and Clothing," page 196.) 

Some things to remember in purchasing wool. 

1. Wool mixed with cotton makes a cheat>er fabric and should 
not be sold for all wool. It wears well, but is not as warm as all 
wool. Garments made of it do not keep their shape as well. Wool- 
ens are often adulterated in felting. Pull the closely woven fabric 
apart and untwist the fibers to see if cotton is present. 

2. The burning test will help in deciding on the composition. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," page 198.) 

3. A good woolen or worsted fabric can always be remade. 
The inexi)ensive is not cheap unless you wish something which costs 
little but does not look weU or wear well. One should not expect 
to get blankets of all wool for two dollars a pair. They cost five or 
six. 

4. Shoddy is one kind of recovered wool and is used to cheapen 



350 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

oost of all-wool material. It can be detected because of shortness 
of the staple of wool, but when mixed is difficult to see. 

5. The weave of material affects the wearing quality. A close 
twill weave is more durable than a basket weave. ' 

Some things to remember about color, 

1. Blue, Dark blue in woolen material or gingham usually 
fades little. Light blue is not as durable in color. 

2. Red, Woolen material of this color wears well and usually 
fades little. Red cotton when washed looks less brilliant. It 
soon fades by washing. 

3. Black and gray, . Woolen materials of gray, white, and black 
or in combination are generally satisfactory. Cotton materials of 
gray or black are apt to show starch in washing. 

4. Lavender. This is a poor color to buy. It fades easily in 
cotton goods. 

5. Pink. Fades with washing. If a deep shade be bought it 
may be satisfactory. 

6. Green, Usually very unsatisfactory. In good high priced 
ginghams it may not fade, but in cheap ones it is apt to turn yellow. 

7. Brown, Good usually in ginghams, but likely to fade in 
woolen materials. 

8. See chapters on costume design and dressmaking in ** Shelter 
and Clothing," for suggestions in relation to colors one should wear. 

The above brief suggestions must be considered in the light of 
the knowledge gained from the study of the chapters on textiles 
in the companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing." 

In purchasing any materials for clothing or household 
furnishings, remember that demand causes production and 
those who are intelligent will make the right demands in the 
right places. Insist on the honest labeling of goods and 
demand that for which you pay. Why should cotton manu- 
facturers label handkerchiefs which are cotton ** pure linen/' 
and sell them at ten cents? We too should know linen can- 
not be bought at that price. The United States government 
employs experts to examine the standards of textiles used in 
making army, navy, and other imiforms, and will accept only 



HOW TO BUY 351 

those materials from the contracting manufacturers which 
stand their tests. If a fuller discussion of the buying of 
textile materials is desired, see Woolman and McGowan's

of textiles, on social and economic conditions, and on clothing 
budgets.

CHAPTER XXII 
HOUSEWIFERY 

This old-fashioned word is used here to include the methods 
and processes connected with the actual work of the house, 
excepting the cookery, sewing, and laundering, which have 
fuller treatment elsewhere. This department of household 
management is a combination of sanitation and the economics 
of labor. 

Order in place. — Keep articles of a kind together con- 
veniently arranged in places set apart for them, these places 
to be easily accessible. Make an inventory of household 
goods in a card file, — household linen, personal apparel, 
including lists of clothing put away for summer or winter, 
dishes, and valuables. Each housekeeper must make a 
scheme that suits her own needs, but a few suggestions may 
be helpful. 

Keep bed linen and towels^ piled preferably on shelves, near bed- 
rooms and bathrooms, marked and numbered. Put the clean 
underneath when they come from the laundry. 

Clothing should be kept in an orderly way by each member of 
the family. Winter clothing and furs should be cleansed for putting 
away, protected from moths by wrapping in paper, hangmg in tar 
bags, putting in cedar chests, or in trunks with some strong odored 
substances, — moth balls or cedar oil. Camphor is too expensive. 
Summer clothing should be washed and put away unstarched and 
unironed. 

Dishes and silver should be carefully arranged in very definite 
placed, and counted often enough to keep account of breakage and 
loss.

354 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT • 

Brooms, brushes, dusters, and cleansing materials should have a 
plaoe of their own, well ventilated when possible, and all articles 
put away clean. 

Order in work and division of labor. — This depends so 
largely upon the number of workers, and upon the equip- 
ment of the house that no definite plan can be made for all. 
The question must be differently answered for the woman 
who has a helper one day a week, or with one or two, or with 
a large staff of workers. However, there should be some 
definite plan for the days of the week and the hours of the 
day, and some division of work among the members of the 
family or between the family and paid helpers. The young 
people of the family should each have some regular piece 
of work, at least in their own rooms ; and the paid helpers 
should have a definite plan given them, including some hours 
to themselves, as regular as possible. There are emergen- 
cies that upset even the most perfect system, and these 
must be met as they come, but a fair amount of work at 
regular times should be the system. 

" Domestic service '' is too large a social and economic 
problem to discuss at length here. Miss Jane Addams calls 
it " belated industry," meaning that in domestic work we 
are far behind the productive industries of commerce in 
organization. We are trying experiments in putting work 
out, and having helpers come in, and in time we may bring 
order out of chaos when employers and employees are all 
properly trained and have the right relation to each other. 

Processes of housewifery. — Good working equipment, 
including labor-saving apparatus, is an essential; and we 
must have knowledge of the effect of different cleansing 
materials on fabrics, wood, paint, glass, and metal. 

Equipment. — Brooms should be made of pliable straw 
(broom com), be evenly made, with a Ught and comfortable 
handle. 



HOUSEWIFERY 355 

Brushes may include the whisk broom, soft brush of 
bristles both short and long handled for floors, a long handled 
brush of wool or soft material for walls, ceilings, and cornices, 
a soft brush for furniture, a thin brush for radiators, a silver 
brush, and stiflf scrubbing brush. The variety of brushes at 
a furnishing shop is very large, and interesting to study. It 
is economy to buy good quality when you can, and if cleaned 
and not abused they last* a long time. Wash the brushes 
in soapsuds and water, drain and dry before putting away. 
A baniboo beater is convenient. The dustpan should have a 
narrow cover at the handle side, and a strong handle. 

Carpet sweepers prevent dust from flying and are easy to 
use, but inclined to wear off the pile of the carpet. 

Vacuum cleaners are a necessity in crowded city quarters, 
where we cannot beat and shake dusty carpets and rugs out 
of windows, on the roof, or in the street, on account of our 
neighbors. That we cannot all have them does not make 
them less necessary. While they may involve no less mus- 
cular exertion they remove dust and old dirt in a remarkable 
way from fabrics, and are very useful for taking dirt from 
cracks in the floor and woodwork and from upholstered fur- 
niture. The principle of operation differs with different 
makes, and some are less effective than others, but there are 
several patterns that do good work and are not expensive. 
Experiment with one at the first opportunity. A room 
cleaned in this way is markedly different in odor from a room 
that has been swept with a broom, even when this is well done. 

A good vacuum cleaner must have an air convejdng sys- 
tem, a separator or other means of disposal of the material 
picked up, and a vacuum producer. They may be divided, 
according to the method employed, into those worked by 
bellows, by fan, by rotary pump and piston pump. This is 
a problem to take to the class in physics. 



356 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cleaning cloths. — Have a good supply of cheesecloth 
dusters, and heavier cloth for work on the floors. A sponge 
and chamois are useful. The mop, which is a cloth or fiber 
fabric on a handle, is something that we ought to banish 
when we can, for it is hard to keep clean, and is a trap for 
bacteria. A substitute for the conunon mop is a long handle 
with a cross bar covered with corrugated rubber, which is 
held down on the cloth, and rubbed back and forth but not 
fastened to the cloth. Avoid the use of linty old cloths, 
because the thread and lint clog the traps and drains. 

Cleaning cloths should be boiled in strong soap suds, 
rinsed, and thoroughly dried before putting away. This is 
a difficult rule to enforce, for it is a temptation to tuck 
such things away where they will not show. Watch this 
matter as you do the garbage pail. When a cloth is too 
dirty to wash clean, bum it or send it away with paper 
refuse. 

Cleaning materials, — Air, sunshine, and water are the 
great purifiers, plus muscular energy or the power of ma- 
chinery, but we frequently use chemical aids. These should 
all be kept in stock. 

Soaps and alkalies. — White and yellow soap, some washing 
powder, sal soda, caustic soda, household ammonia. Buy these in 
quantities if you have room to store them, and if they will not be 
used too lavishly because the supply is large. The soap is not much 
cheaper by the box, but it hardens with age, and then it wastes 
less rapidly when used. 

Oils and polishes. — Crude oil, kerosene, a mixture of linseed 
oil, vinegar, and turpentine, one part each, cottonseed oil, alcohol. 

Acids. — A solution of oxalic acid marked poison. Vinegar is 
on hand among kitchen supplies. 

Gritty substances. — Rotten stone, whiting, some gritty soap of a 
kind that does not scratch, a gritty powder, or fine sand for coarse 
work. 

Disinfectant and deodorizers. — A weak solution of carbolic acid 



HOUSEWIFERY 357 

marked poison, chloride of lime, or some reliable preparation^ 
(though these are rather expensive), rock salt, and coarse common 
salt. 

Methods of cleaning. — We must first consider what the 
substance is that has to be removed. The fabrics and up- 
holstery used in furnishing catch dust which contains lint, 
grit, organic material from our bodies, and bacteria. Fab- 
rics also become spotted (see next chapter). The walls 
and ceilings, floors and cracks, catch dust. All wood and 
glass surfaces become soiled from the touch of even clean 
fingers, and the moisture of the air mixed with dust dulls 
them. Metal surfaces oxidize, and this oxidized layer must 
be rubbed ofif. 

To dean fabrics, — If you live in a suburb or in the country, 
brush, shake, and beat articles to be cleaned out of doors, noticing 
the way of the wind that the dust may not be carried back into the 
house. 

To cleanse a rug, spread it on the grass, rub with a medium 
stiff brush with white soap solution on the wrong side, turn it over, 
and rinse with water from the hose ; or better still, tack it by two 
comers to a wooden wall, and then wash with hose. The city 
dweller must resort to the vacuum cleaner, or rely upon a cleaning 
establishment. The other alternative is to shake out the dust in 
the room, remove each article as it is cleaned, let the dust settle, 
.and take it out as well as it can be. One apartment dweller heard 
this remark rise from the window below her: " Shut the window 
quick. Those dirty people upstairs are brushing a rug out the 
window ! " 

Painted surfaces and woodwork should be wiped off with a soft 
cloth wrung out of tepid water. A small amount of neutral white 
soap solution in the water can be used for paint if it is greasy, but 
alkalies are ruinous. 

A highly polished surface (piano) is cleaned by washing with 

1 Some of the widely advertised disinfectants are rather ineffective. 
Those interested should look up the tests of commercial disinfectants pub- 
lished from time to time by the United States Public Health Servicfe. 



358 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a sponge and tepid water, and rubbing until dry with a toet chamois 
wrung out of oold water. This method was learned from a piano 
polisher, and it works excellently. A dry ohamois streaks the 

surface. 

« 

The wood of furniture is kept clean by rubbing with a soft dry 
cloth, but once in a while needs cleaning with crude oil or the mix- 
ture of oil, turpentine, and vinegar. Bureau drawers need watch- 
ing for finger marks. 

Glass is best cleaned by rubbing on a mixture of whiting and 
water. Leave it to dry and rub off with a dry cloth. A fine gritty 
soap comes for this purpose. Ammonia and water and a soft 
cloth work well, the success depending upon the final polishing. 
Very soft tissue paper is satisfactory for polishing. 

MarblCy 'porcelain, and enamel need little more than white soap 
suds, rinsed off and the surface dried. If i^potted, use the finest 
kind of metal soap* 

Metals. — Fine silver and plated ware should be kept polished 
by the daily careful washing, rinsing in hot water. Silver will 
spot and tarnish. Use whiting and alcohol, let it dry on, and rub 
off with a clean cloth or chamois. 

The silver powders sold at the silversmith's are very good, but 
the patent powders and liquids should not be used, as they remove 
too much of the silver. 

Brass and copper are polished with rotten stone and oil. If 
the metal is spotted, use oxalic acid solution with the rotten stone. 
After rubbing well, the metal should be washed off in hot soap suds 
and finished with a dry cloth. 

Nickel plate keeps bright if kept clean by daily dry rubbing. 

Care of rooms. — The bedroom, — The daily care includes 
airing the room and its closets, airing and making the bed, 
dusting, removing lint and threads from the floor, and re- 
moving slops and bringing fresh water if bathing apparatus 
is in the room. 

To make the bed, — The amount of airing of the bedclothes 
depends somewhat upon the weather ; bed linen absorbs too much 
damp if placed by the window on a rainy or foggy day. Pull back 
the bedclothes and hang them over a chair set front to the foot of 



HOUSEWIFERY 359 

the bed, seeing that the bedclothes do not drag on the floor. On a 
bright, fresh day remove all the clothes and hang them singly near 
the window. If there is a screen in the room, this is convenient for 
this purpose. The blankets should be hung out on the line once in 
a while, and washed twice a year. One important point in the 
cleanliness of the bed is a pad or thick cloth placed on the mat- 
tress under the sheet. The mattress should be sunned and aired 
often, and beaten or cleaned with the vacuum cleaner. 

To make the bed, place the cover on the mattress, lay the under 
sheet straight, tuck in firmly at top and bottom, and fold the sides 
under straight, making angles at the comers. Put each piece on 
separately, turning the upper sheet down over the others. The 
cover is sometimes placed over all, and a strip to match over the 
pillows. 

Care of the washstand. — This is all important, and cannot be 
neglected a day, without causing an unpleasant odor. The jars 
containing slops should be rinsed in cold water, washed out in warm 
soap suds, dried, and aired. If the ware is china, hot water may 
crackle the glaze, and then it is impossible to remove odors. Wash 
and dry all the small articles and wipe out and refill the water 
pitcher. 

Care of the bedroom at night, — Fold back, or remove the covers, 
and lay the bedclothes partly back. See that drinking water 
is in the room, and lighting conveniences. 

The living room, dining room, and halls. — The daily 
care consists in setting furniture and such small articles as 
the pictures and ornaments straight, removing lint and dust 
from the floor, dusting wherever needed. 

The weekly cleaning of 'all rooms. — Whether a thorough 
cleaning is needed weekly, depends upon the situation of the 
house, and the number of people who use the rooms. The 
rooms in a country house set in wide green spaces do not need 
cleaning so often as those of a city house. 

General order for all rooms. — Dust all small articles, place 
them together and cover them. Dust and clean off furniture and 
take the lighter pieces from the room. Cover what remains. Clean 



360 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the textile fabrics in the best way available. Brush the walls, 
with a special brush, or soft cloth on a broom. Dust and cover 
pictures. Brush the rugs, or use vacuum cleaner. If the floor is' 
hardwood, brush it with a soft brush, taking long, steady strokes 
from comer and sides to center. Take up dust in pan, and carry 
away to bum, or put in dust can at once. Wipe the floor with moist 
cloth, or with oiled cloth. 

If there is a carpet and a broom is to be used, scatter pieces of 
wet paper over it, moisten the broom, and sweep as directed for 
brushing, using steady strokes and not allowing the dust to fly. 
The broom should be washed and dried. If dust flies, allow it 
time to settle. Dust the surfaces left exposed. Wipe off the wood- 
work if necessary, remove covers, and replace all articles. To have 
the room perfectly clean, windows should be washed, but if this is 
not convenient at the time, or the weather is bad, rub them and 
dust the sashes. Wash mirrors and the glass of pictures. This 
means much labor, and some people cannot accomplish it every 
week ; and different rooms should have different cleaning days. But 
such thorough cleaning occasionally is necessary for keeping all 
articles in good condition and also for the health of the family. 

The old-fashioned yearly house cleaning seems hardly necessary 
if cleaning is well done through the year, but in both fall and spring 
some extra freshening may be necessary in the way of thorough 
cleansing of textiles and furniture. All closets should have every- 
thing removed from them and the whole closet cleansed. Drawers 
should come out, be emptied, washed and aired, and fresh white 
or brown paper put in all. 

The bathroom and toilet. — This needs very particular 
care, no matter what the type may be. All drains and traps 
should be flushed daily, and a solution of caustic soda put 
down weekly. If there is an odor about the water closet, 
try salt first, and then some chloride preparation. The basin, 
the tub, and the seat and basin of the toilet should be thor- 
oughly washed daily. When the bathroom is used by more 
than one person, all should be taught to leave all the toilet 
equipment perfectly clean. If the toilet is not of the water- 
closet type, even greater care should be taken. Everything 



HOUSEWIFERY 361 

must be kept scrubbed clean, and chloride of lime should 
be put down daily, if there is not a removable pail with earth. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," p. 48.) 

Care of lamps. — If kerosene is used, this is an important 
feature of housework. 

Have a tray for holding necessary articles, soft cloth, paper, 
strong, sharp scissors, lamp chimney brush. When the lamp is to 
be cleaned, set it upon this tray. Take off all the easily removable 
parts. Fill the lamp through a funnel, and do not let the kerosene 
run over. Wipe off the charred wick with paper, and wipe the 
burner. Wash off the lamp in warm soap suds, wash and polish 
the chimney and shade, and replace. If you cannot get rid of odor, 
take the burner apart, boil it in a solution of washing soda, and put 
in a new wick. Cleaning a lamp is not nearly so disagreeable as 
many people think it, when it is done with good will. To shirk it 
means an unpleasant odor in the room and a poor light. Always 
fiU the lamp in the daytime and keep it away from the fire. 

Household insects. — Keep out flies and mosquitoes by 
screens, but see first that your premises are clean, and do 
what you can in the whole neighborhood. 

Flies breed in dirty stables and mosquitoes in standing water. 
The stables must be cleaned and kept so, and water drained off or 
kerosene put upon it. Mosquitoes will breed in water in an empty 
milk bottle or old tomato can. If flies enter the house, kill them in 
some way. Wire or net fly killers cost only ten cents, and do 
good work. If the flies are very numerous, catch them in wire traps, 
or bum pjrrethrum powder in the room. At night when they are 
on the ceiling, catch them in a glass of hot water and soap, not 
quite full, by holding the glass under the fly and gently knocking 
the glass against the ceiling. If the ceiling is high, tack an empty 
can on the end of an old broom stick and set the glass in that. 

Clothing moths are kept out by precautions already mentioned. 

If bed bugs appear, go over the bed with great care and examine 
the bedstead. Wash it off with kerosene, putting this well into 
the cracks. A single insect may be brought in on the clothing. If 
they continue to appear, all wall paper should be removed, wood- 



362 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

work varnished or painted. It may be necessary to resort to fumi- 
gation, but this should be done by an expert. Croton or water 
bugs are difficult to destroy, if they are once in a house. No gar- 
bage should be left about, to attract them at night. There are 
powders that drive them ^ away, and another remedy is sulphur 
paste, which comes for the purpose, and which may be spread on 
slices of potato. The U. S. Department of Agriculture issues free 
bulletins on the suppression of household insects. 

Precautions against fire. — So many disastrous fires occur 
as a result of a careless act that we need to train ourselves 
in caution. The matches used should be of the safety type. 
They should be blown out, never shaken, and never thrown 
into a basket of papers. When matches are used, always 
have a small fire-proof receptacle in each room. Smokers 
are often careless in regard to their matches, cigars, and pipes. 
Be careful in summer to see that a breeze cannot blow some 
light curtain over a candle or lamp. 

If a kettle of fat catches fire, pour on sand, but never water. 
As a general rule, extinguish a flame by covering it rather than by 
throwing on water. 

If clothing catches on fire, wrap a rug or any large woolen article 
tightly around the body. To rush into the air is fatal. 

If a towel or apron catches fire, roll it lip quickly before the blaze 
spreads. This can be done without injury to the hands. 

Small fire extinguishers are not expensive. Most kinds contain 
a solution of soda and a bottle of sulphuric acid which mix when the 
extinguisher is inverted, and throw out a stream of water charged 
with gas from a small hose. This works well just as a fire starts. Ex- 
tinguishers arranged to throw a stream, of carbon tetrachloride are 
also on the market. 

Repairs. — Too often in planning the budget, and the 
daily work, the housekeeper forgets to allow for the constant 
wear and tear on the house itself, and its furnishings ; but 
to preserve the beauty and usefulness of both the house and 
furniture, as much thought and time are necessary as for the 



HOUSEWIFERY 363 

repair of clothing. In addition to the care and cleaning, 
there must be a constant attention to small repairs. 

Inspecting and reporting, — Have a series of cards in the card 
file, or pages in the notebook, where needed repairs may be jotted 
down. Have a regular time for looking over different parts of the 
house ; and give a brief daily look as you pass from room to room. 
Each member of the family should be asked to report whatever goes 
wrong in his province, — a leaky faucet, a squeaky door, or broken 
castor, a tear in a curtain, a shade roller that does not work. 

For large repairs, like a leak in the water or waste system or 
shingle on a roof, a trained worker is needed ; but for small repairs 
a special worker from outside is too expensive, and there needs to 
be a handy person in the house, who can put in a screw, and use a 
monkey wrench, touch up the paint or varnish, or mend the waU 
paper. It is pleasant work, and in these days when schools teach so 
much handicraft, there should be some one in the family glad to 
do it. 

A repair outfit. — Have a shelf somewhere for the repair **kit," 
Look at the woodwork of your house, and see what is needed; 
whether paint, or varnish, an oil mixture or stain, or all of them. 
Have on hand a small can of each, and bottles of alcohol, turpentine, 
and glue. Two or three paint brushes of good quality and of dif- 
ferent sizes are needed. Keep a bundle of wall paper including 
pieces of all the patterns on the walls. A box of tools is needed, 
including a hammer, gimlet, screw driver, monkey wrench, a sharp 
knife, with boxes of nails and screws of mixed kinds and sizes such 
as may be found at any hardware store.

CHAPTER XXIII 
LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 

" Washing is a necessity, ironing a luxury." This terse 
sentence expresses very clearly the relative value of the two 
large divisions of the laundering process. The thorough 
washing of clothing is a most important branch of household 
sanitation, upon which the health of the family and of the 
whole community depends, for disease is communicable by 
means of soiled garments and those that are imperfectly 
cleansed in unsanitary houses and possibly in commercial 
laundries. The ideal city will have many large and spot- 
lessly clean laundries, where skilled labor intelligently di- 
rected will insure clothing as clean as it can possibly be made. 

There is an aesthetic element in laundering as well, for good 
washing methods give a tinted white to fabrics that it is a 
pleasure to see, and ironing makes a smoothness that is 
pleasant to the touch, and brings out beauty of design, as 
in damasks and embroideries. There is an economic feature, 
too, in that poor and rough methods of work in both washing 
and ironing injure fabrics and shorten their term of usable- 
ness. 

" Washing Day " has an ill repute that it does not deserve, 
for laundering is a science and an art that it is a pleasure to 
practice, if one has skill. Make it one of the household arts 
which you must carefully study, and you will find it pleasur- 
able as well as necessary. 

Soil in garments. — The dust and dirt of the street and 

house that soil our garments contain inorganic particles of 

365 



366 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

earth, lint from textiles, organic matter from animals and 
human beings, and also bacteria. The material from our 
bodies consists of particles of skin, skin secretions, and bac- 
teria, which are collected in underwear and bed linen and 
towels. Spots of grease and stains may fall upon our outer 
clothing, and fruit stains affect table linen in particular. 

Cleansing agents. — Water is the great cleanser, and if 
it is not available in abundance and used freely, the washing 
is a failure. All other agents are merely aids to the water 
or substitutes for it. In primitive outdoor methods, still 
largely used in some countries, the flowing water is the only 
agent, and yet the result is fairly good. We aid the process 
by the use of soap or washing powders or ammonia. 

The air and sun are also purifiers, and clothing should be 
exposed to their action for drying whenever possible. There 
is a sweetness in air and sun-dried clothing that no artificial 
drier seems to give. Probably there takes place some oxi- 
dation of impurities present in very small amount and, more- 
over, any bacteria still clinging to the fabric may be killed 
by the sun's rays. Heat is a purifier, oily substances being 
more readily removed by hot water and soap than by cold ; 
and the boiling temperature of water renders bacteria and 
organic matter harmless. 

Some mechanical action that forces water through the 
fabric is necessary, and the method of accomplishing this is 
one of the important problems in laundering. We seek a 
method that will be thorough, that will not injure the fabric, 
and that will economize the muscular energy of the worker. 
Beating, pounding, and rubbing are the old methods, the 
use of a machine the new, and that is the best machine that 
meets all the requirements of the properly conducted washing 
process as described below. 

The water should be soft and clean. Rain water is a per- 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 367 

fectly soft water and excellent for laundering if the cistern 
is kept clean, and free from the dust of the roof. Lake, 
river, and well water are sometimes soft. Strainers may be 
used on the faucets if at any time the water from these 
sources becomes muddy. (See Chapter V for discussion of 
soft and hard water.) 

Hard water prevents the soap from lathering, and this 
must be counteracted for laundering. Temporary hardness 
is removed by boiling. Permanent hardness is not affected 
by boiling and can be overcome only by the addition of some 
substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. Only enough of 
these should be used to allow the soap to do its work, since 
they may injure fabric and the skin of the worker. 

Soap is the most useful of the cleansing agents added to 
water. It may have been accidentally made in the first 
place by some housewife who put a greasy pot to soak with 
a solution of lye made from the ashes of her hearth fire. Heat 
and alkali break up the fat into two parts, glycerin and a fatty 
acid. The fatty acid combines with the alkali, giving soap, 
and the glycerin remains free. Both animal and vegetable 
fats are used, and different forms of alkali, usually potash or 
caustic soda, the former for soft, the latter for hard, soap. 

In these days soap is much better made in the factory than 
it can be at home. In the factory the alkali is proportioned 
by weight, so that as little free alkali is left as possible. 
Such a soap is called " neutral." Resin is added, in yellow 
laxmdry soaps, and is supposed to aid in forming suds. When 
there is an excess of resin, as in some cheap soaps, it is hard 
to rinse out and colors the clothes. Borax is sometimes 
added to soap, and is useful when the water is hard, but not 
necessary in soft water. Naphtha or some other petroleum 
oil in soap increases the cleansing property of soap, by dis- 
solving fatty or greasy impurities. 



368 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A soap solution is essential for use in the boiler and in 
washing machines and is useful for rubbing on spots before 
washing. 

To make soap solution, cut up the soap and dissolve it in hot 
water, one poiuid soap to one gallon of water. It should be strong 
enough to jelly when oool, and may be kept in jars ready to use. 
Even more convenient are soap chips which come by the barrel, but 
may be bought at pound rates. 

Bleaching and bluing agents. — The sun, as it bleaches 
white fabrics, may be counted in this group. Chemical 
bleaches are used to whiten clothes, but should not be re- 
sorted to unless clothes are yellow from poor washing, as in 
the end they weaken the fabric. Commercial laundries 
sometimes use an excess of acid for this purpose. Cream of 
tartar is a harmless bleach. Javelle water is another house- 
hold bleach, chloride of lime being the bleaching substance. 
This is also a good disinfectant. 

To use cream of tartar. — Dissolve cream of tartar in hot water, 

1 teaspoonful to each quart. After the yellowed fabrics have been 
thoroughly washed and rinsed, lay them overnight in a solution 
of this strength, rinse, blue, and dry in the morning. 

Javelle water. — J pound chloride of lime, 1 pound sal soda, 

2 quarts of cold water. Dissolve the chloride in half^ the water 
cold, and the sal soda in the other half boiling. Stir together 
thoroughly, allow the mixture to stand several hours, pour off the 
clear water with care, and bottle it. Use a tablespoonful of the 
solution to a gallon of water, and heat the yellow fabric in this 
mixture after thorough washing, for half an hour, not allowing the 
temperature to rise above 100** F. Rinse very thoroughly before 
bluing and drying. 

Bluing is used to neutralize the slightly yellowish tint of 

the fabric, when it cannot be completely bleached. 

Ultramarine blue is sold in small balls and cakes. 

Aniline blue is a strong color, and in a very dilute solution gives 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 369 

a pleasing pearly tint to the fabric, especially when the violet tint 
is used. Mix an ounce of the blue with one gallon water, and bottle 
for use. 

Prussian blue is to be avoided, since it is a salt of iron, and often 
yellows or spots the clothes. It is usually sold in liquid form. To 
test, mix the liquid blue with a strong solution of washing soda and 
heat. If the mixture turns red, and there is a reddish precipitate, 
the blue is this salt of iron. 

Starch is used to fill the interstices of fabrics and give a 
smoothness and stififness to the cloth that prevents the 
rumpling of garments. Both wheat and cornstarch are used 
for laundry purposes when only the natural starches are 
available, the wheat starch being better for home laundering, 
as the cornstarch gives a quality that is too stifif and crack- 
ling. Recently, however, the manufacturers have learned 
to make " thin boiling " starches from corn and have placed 
on the market a variety of such modifications of cornstarch 
for laundry use. Rice starch or " rice water '' is used for 
very thin muslins. 

To make starch, — For method of making, see starch experiments, 
Chapter VIII. The starch must be perfectly smooth, and should be 
stirred while it is boiling for a few minutes, and strained. 

Proportions, 

1. For lingerie, 1 teaspoonful of starch to 1 quart water. 

2. For medium fabrics, 1} to 3 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart 
water. 

3. For stiff work, 5 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart water. 

Ironing. — The ironing process is the most difficult art 
in laimdering, and requires good tools, practice, and patience. 
In the summer it is an exhausting labor unless an electric 
or gas iron is available. Much energy may be saved in hot 
weather by omitting the ironing of certain articles. Dish 
towels, even toilet towels, and soft underwear may be 
stretched and folded, and are perfectly comfortable to use. 
2b 



370 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Some women who do their own work even fold sheets and 
pillow cases without ironing. 

The smoothing of the fabric is accomplished by heated 
irons, or by pressing between rollers in a mangle. 

To summarize, — The essential steps in laundering are: 
the forcing of clear water through the fabric ; loosening of 
the soil and stains by soap and appropriate chemicals, sterili- 
zation by boiling temperature, drying and sweetening in the 
air if possible. The less essential are bluing, starching, and 
in some cases ironing. 

Laundry equipment. — We are beginning to realize that a 
separate room for laundering purposes is an essential in a 
well-equipped home. Such a laundry will be light and well 
ventilated, will have washable floors, walls, and ceilings, 
running water and, hot water supply, sanitary tubs and con- 
veniences in the shape of machinery. We shall not have 
perfect laundries until electric power is available at a fair 
price. Much is said about electricity on the farm, and the 
progressive farmer who has his own engine should not fail 
to use the power for all laundry work. Trolley power should 
be available, and this use of electricity should be made co- 
operative when practicable. In a few communities abroad 
and at home, the power available in a creamery is used for 
laundering purposes as well. 

Where there cannot be a separate laundry, take pains to 
have the equipment as good as space will allow. 

The tubs. — If possible, have three tubs, for this makes for econ- 
omy of time. Enameled tubs are the most sanitary, and be sure 
that they are white. You cannot tell whether or not the clothes 
are clean and blued to the proper tint in a buff-tinted tub, which 
you may be tempted to buy because it is cheaper. 

Round portable tubs, to be set upon a bench, should be of gal- 
vanized iron, which is sanitary and light. Wooden tubs are things 
of the past, unsanitary and heavy. 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 371 

Equipmfnt for forcing water. — The rubbing board is the old-time 
method, yet it wears the fabric and wears out the worker, and 
should be used as little as possible. If still considered necessary, 
it should be of glass set in wood. The wooden board is unsanitary 
and the metal board may at any moment develop a tiny crack that 
wiU.tear the fabric. 

Fortunately, many women are learning that the washing machine, 
properly used, is a great economy of fabric, time, and strength. 
Many machines are on the market, and we need to discriminate 
and to select the machine constructed to force the water through 
the fabric without injury to the fabric, and with the smallest 
amount of muscular energy and that properly exerted without 
strain. Of course, if machine power is available, the problem is 
easy. These many washers may be classed in four groups. One 
is a revolving arrangement, sometimes consisting of two corrugated 
boards set in the center of a tub of clothes, one objection being that 
the clothes are sometimes torn. Another type has a revolving 
perforated inner cyUnder for the clothes, and an outer one for the 
soap and water. This is much more expensive. Still a third rocks 
the clothes in soap and water and is very effective. A fourth type 
makes use of suction. 

The principle of cleansing by pressure and suction is used in 
several machines and hand washers, and these are, on the whole, 
inexpensive and practical for home work. The work is accomplished 
by an inverted cone, pushed down on the clothes, and lifted. Such 
a washer is seen standing on the floor in Fig. 80. The same figure 
also shows another of this type standing on the table, and stilly 
another to be used in the boiler. 

Most of these devices can be used with power. 

The boiler. — A portable boiler is convenient. It should be 
made of good quality tin with copper bottom and must be thoroughly 
washed and dried after using. 

The wringer is of great assistance to good work. It should be a 
good machine having hard rubber rollers, ball-bearing action, and 
strong springs at the side. It must be cleaned after using, dried, 
the pressure loosened, and the whole kept covered. 

The drier. — If clothesline or heavy wire is used, this must be of 
good quality, and well cared for. The clothesline should be taken 
in after each using. A revolving drier is convenient, and may even 



372 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 373 

be used in apartment houses. The steam drier has a rack on which 
clothes are hung, and economizes space and time. 

Irons. — The hand iron is heated in several different ways. 
The old-fashioned iron heated on the stove, and the electric iron are 
the most satisfactory. In buying hand irons, select those of good 
weight, for this makes the work easier. Three or four will suffice 
for ordinary work, and they should weigh from 4 or 5 to 7 pounds. 
A small pointed iron is necessary for fine work, and for sleeves there 
is a special, narrow iron. The irons must be kept clean, and per- 
fectly dry when not in use. Wax tied in a cloth is a good cleaner, 
and should be at hand during the ironing process. A stand is nec- 
essary on which the iron may rest, and paper or cloth on which 
to rub the iron when it comes from the stove. 

Electric irons are proving very satisfactory, and although the 
first cost is high, they should be used wherever possible. 

The mangle. — Small mangles, used either cold or heated, are 
now made for family use, and are great labor savers in flat work. 
Towels and small flat pieces may even be put through the wringer, 
while they are still damp, with very good effect. 

The ironing board. — This should be firm, well padded, and 
covered with clean cloth. The cover may be made to tie on so 
that it can be easily changed. Ironing boards should be placed 
in a good Ught. Boards may be attached to the wall, and these 
have firm support. In a small room, the board can be made to 
turnup. 

Other apparatus. — A hamper or bag for soiled clothes, a basket 
for clean, pail and dipper, a clothes stick, a large pan, a small and a 
large saucepan, a teakettle for boiling water, a knife, wooden sx)oon, 
common spoons and measures, a sprinkler or brush for sprinkling 
clothes, a clotheshorse, clothes hangers for waists and dresses. 
The soiled clothes bag should be washed weekly, and the hamper 
should have a removable lining also for weekly washing. 

Monday and Tuesday are the traditional days for washing 
and ironing, but the woman who does her own work, or per- 
haps has a helper, or one maid, may find it a good plan to do 
no more on Monday than the mending, removing of stains, 
and sorting. This gives time to make the house orderly, 
after Sunday, and to prepare food, some of which may last 



374 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over the next two days. Some of the clothes may then be 
soaked overnight. 

Order of work. — Mending, sorting the clothes, removing 
stains, soaking, washing, boiling, rinsing, bluing, starching, 
drying, sprinkling and rolling, ironing, folding, airing, 
sortmg, and distributing. 

Methods. — Mending and removing spots from fabrics 
are discussed in ''Shelter and Clothing." A few common 
stains are removed as follows : 

Fruit and coffee stains. — Hold the spotted fabric tightly over a 
bowl and pour boiling water through it. Of course, remove stains 
at once if possible. 

Peach stains are removed by Javelle water. Apply a few drops 
and pour boiling water through at once. 

Cocoa and chocolate stains are helped by borax, and by soap and 
cold water. 

Ink, — Liquid ink removers provided for the Ubrary table are 
convenient. Wet the spot, use 1, dry with a blotter, and use 2, 
and rinse at once. The same thing is done by wetting, applying 
an oxahc acid solution first, then Javelle water and rinsing. 

Blood stains are removed by soaking in lukewarm water, and 
washmg in a soap solution with a Uttle ammonia and kerosene, or 
with a naphtha soap. 

Sorting. — Separate the fabrics, wool from cotton and so on, 
and colored cotton from white ; also separate body linen from bed 
linen and from table Hnen. 

Soaking. — This hastens the process since it loosens dirt, and 
one laboratory experiment seemed to show that soaked clothes are 
freer from bacteria, than those that are not. 

Shrinkable fabrics cannot be soaked. Body and table linen 
should be soaked separately. The water should be cold, softened 
with a little ammonia. 

Washing. — Wash woolens and silk underwear first, in warm^ 
not hot, soap suds, wring out, rinse, and hang to dry. Use a white, 
neutral soap. Have the same temperature for both washing and 
rinsing. Boiling water shrinks wool, and yellows silk. Hand- 
knit wool, as shawls and jackets, stretch in drying. If dried in a 



, LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 375 

bag or pillow case, this is partly obviated, or lay them on a pad on 
the table. 

Prepare hot water in the tub, with dissolved soap in it, either for 
handwork or a washer. Wash table linen first, then bed linen and 
towels, and next the body clothes. Soap the articles well, and 
rub or use a washer. It is well to wash handkerchiefs by them- 
selves, boiling in a pail for half an hour. If one of the family has a 
cold or influenza, soak his handkerchiefs in a solution of salt and 
water and perhaps a little bleaching powder before washing and 
boiling. 

Make fresh suds often. This means heavy labor in the case 
of portable tubs, but clothes cannot be cleansed in dirty water. 

Colored cotton and linen articles may be washed last. They 
should be put first into salt and water to set the color, washed in 
tepid water with white soap, rinsed thoroughly and hung in the 
shade, wrong side out. 

Boiling. — Boil the washed clothes in soap solution for ten min- 
utes. In case of infectious disease, all the patient's linen should 
be boiled an hour,^ and of course exposed clothing is kept separate 
through the whole process. 

Rinsing. — This must be thorough and two or three waters must 
be used. This is the stage where many laundresses fail. The 
suction washers are very useful here. 

Wringing. — This must take place between every two stages of 
the process. 

Bluing. — Add the bluing solution to clean water to the desired 
shade, shake each piece, put it through the water, and wring out 
at once. Do not use bluing in excess. 

Starching. — Next the fabrics that need a little thin starch may 
be starched. Starch for stiff collars and shirts is rubbed in at the 
time of ironing. 

Drying. — Hang out the . clothes, having pieces of a kind to- 
gether, and the threads straight. If out of doors, hang in such a 
way that the air will have easy access. 

Take down, when dry, and fold lightly in a basket. 

Sprinkle, roll tightly, and leave them until ironing time. Thin 
fabrics should be very moist, as they dry quickly. 

1 Depending upon the nature of the infection, it may be possible to sub- 
stitute the use of a proper disinfectant, followed by short boiling. 



376 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Ironing. — This art must be acquired by watching the expert 
and by practice. 

Shake or stretch the article, and lay it straight upon the board.

and iron with the long thread of the material. Bring the article 
on the board toward you. Iron first the parts that will wrinkle least, 
such as ruffles and trimming and sleeves. Embroidery and damask 
should be ironed on a very soft material like a Turkish towel, right 
side down. Always iron until the fabric is dry. 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING

3. 



All tucks and folds myst be carefully straightened, and if ironed 
crooked, they must be made very wet and done over again. When 
ironing a waist will you do the sleeve or the body first ? 

Large flat pieces, 
towels, and napkins 
are folded in the iron- 
ing. Doilies and 
centerpieces should 
not be folded. 

Folding is neces- 
sary in order to make 
the garments of con- 
venient shape for put- 
ting away. Figures 
81 and 82 will suggest 
the method for some 
garments. 

Commercial laun- 
dries. — The con- 
venience of these 
has been suggested 
already. When we 
can make them all 
sanitary, and when 
methods are used 
that will not injure 
the fabric, we can 
safely put this kind 
of work out of the 
house, but at present many commercial laundries are unsan- 
itary and ruin the clothes. 

Cost of laundering. — We cannot have good service with- 
out paying for it, and one cause of poor laundry work is the 
public demand for cheap work, and this too has its effect 
upon the laimdry worker. The housekeeper often fails to

378 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

have the laundry ready when the wagon calls, and yet de- 
mands a quick return, which also results in poor work. 

If you have never done any laundering and expect a laun- 
dress to do up fine lingerie at a low rate, it will be a revelation 
to you to attempt to iron a shirt waist or lingerie dress, and 
then decide what remuneration you would yourself like to 
receive. One class of high school girls, after a course of six 
laundry lessons, decided that a dollar a dozen was fair pay 
for ordinary work ! This is an interesting question for class 
and home discussion. 

Dry cleaning. — This is accomplished by gasoline, 
naphtha, or benzine, and should not be attempted by the 
city dweller. In the country or suburbs, it should be done 
out of doors, far from any source of fire. Use a basin or tub, 
and immerse the article in the liquid, using as much as if 
water, lifting gently up and down. Rinse in a second por- 
tion. A suction washer may be used with large garments. 
Do not rub the fabric in the liquid. Lift, drain, and hang to 
dry. Keep the can in a safe place, safety being insured by 
coolness. 

Powdered French chalk may be rubbed into delicate silk 
and wool, where there is a grease spot, or an oiliness from 
the skin. Leave for twenty-four hours, then shake, and 
brush out. 

Ether and chalk may be used, but the ether affects some 
people unpleasantly, and dissolves out some delicate colors. 
Meal may also be used for cleaning wool, especially knitted 
fabrics, but it is difficult to shake out, and it needs blowing 
out on the clothesline. 

Labvraiory management. — A few lessons can be given in laundering where 
there is no complete equipment. Dish towels, doilies, and napkins can at 
least be washed in dishpans in the school kitchen, and a few irons provided. 
A few such lessons are helpful at least in developing an appreciation of what 
good laundering means at home and to the community.

Digestion of the foodstuffs 

Having seen wbat each of the foodstuffs does in nourishing the 
body, we may now see how they are prepared for the use of the body 
in the digestive tract. 

Digestion of carbohydrate. — The simplest carbohydrate is a 
sugar which cannot be broken up into other sugars. Such a simple 
sugar is called a monosaccharid. There are two common in foods, 
glucose and fructose ; a third, galactose, is derived from more com- 
plex sugars. Two simple sugars united chemically make a double 
sugar or disaccharid ; thus cane sugar or sucrose will yield glucose 
and fructose, while milk sugar or lactose will yield glucose and 
galactose, and maltose will yield two portions of glucose. These ' 
three disaccharids are the only common ones. Starches, dextrins, 
and cellulose or vegetable fiber are made of many simple glucose 



APPENDIX 385 

groups, and are henoe called polysaccharids. All carbohydrates 
to be used by the body must be reduced to simple sugars. Glucose 
needs no digestion therefore, but the double sugars must be split 
by enzymes into two simple sugars in the intestinal juice, one 
for each kind, namely, sucrase (sucrose-splitting), maltase (mal- 
tose-splitting) and lactase (lactose-splitting). The digestion of 
starches and dextrins begins in the mouth, where amylase (starch- 
splitting) changes starch first to dextrin and finally to maltose, 
and maltase may change a little of the maltose so formed into 
glucose. In the stomach there are no enzymes acting on carbo- 
hydrates, but the digestion may continue under the infiuence of 
swallowed saliva for a time. In the pancreatic juice there is another 
amylase, which completes the splitting of starch to maltose, and 
then the intestinal maltase can reduce this to glucose, which will be 
absorbed. Cellulose cannot be digested and simply serves to add 
bulk to the diet. 

Digestion of fat. — A fat is made up of two parts, one a fatty 
acid, the other glycerol. Fat cannot be absorbed by the body until 
it is split into these two parts. A fat splitting enzyme is called a 
lipase. There is none in the mouth ; one in the stomach works only 
on fat in the state of emulsion ; the most powerful is found in the 
pancreatic juice. Since fat cannot be digested in the mouth nor to 
any great extent in the stomach, it is bad to have food coated with 
it, for the protein and carbohydrates will have to wait till the fat is 
digested away, before they can be digested ; that is, till the intestine 
is reached. This is one reason why pastries and fried foods are hard 
to digest. 

Digestion of protein. — There are no enzymes in the mouth acting 
on protein. In the stomach, the hydrochloric acid helps to make it 
soften and swell, and then pepsin begins its digestion. Protein, 
like fat and carbohydrate, can be subdivided into smaller and 
smaller portions, finally being reduced to a form which the body can 
absorb, namely, amino acids, of which there may be 17 or 18 kinds 
from a single protein. 

The digestion in the stomach produces chiefly large fragments of 
the original protein, called proteoses. In the pancreatic juice is a 
powerful enzyme called trypsin, which digests proteins, first to frag- 
ments, next smaller than proteoses, called peptones, and finally 
breaks these peptones into amino acids. In the intestinal juice is 

2c 



386 APPENDIX 

another enzyme called erepsin, which also forms amino acids from 
proteoses and peptones, thus finishing any digestion of protein left 
incomplete by the trypsin. 

Fate of the absorbed foodstuffs 

Carbohydrates, absorbed as glucose or other monosaccharids, are 
carried by the portal blood to the liver, and thence passed into the 
bloo^, to be burned in the muscles, if needed for fuel, or stored tem- 
porarily in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a polysaccharid yield- 
ing glucose) for future conversion to sugar when required as fuel. 

Fats, passing through the intestinal wall as fatty acids and 
glycerol, enter the lymph largely as fat again, and finally pass to 
the blood to be burned in the muscles for fuel, or to be stored as fat 
until needed. 

Proteins pass into the blood as amino acids. Those needed for 
building material are taken up by the cells (especially cells of the 
muscles) and those not required for this purpose are freed from their 
nitrogen (in the liver or muscles) and then burned for fuel. 

For a fuller discussion of the fate of the absorbed foodstuffs see 
Chapter IV of Sherman's " Chemistry of Food and Nutrition."

Chemistry and its Relations to Daily Life 

By LOUIS KAHLENBERG and EDWIN B. HART | 

Professors of Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin I 

Clothi J2m0f illustrated, jg J pages. List price. Si. 25 



If the contributions of chemical science to modern civilization 
were suddenly swept away, what a blank there would be ! If, on 
the other hand, every person were acquainted with the elements of 
chemistry and its bearing upon our daily life, what an uplift human 
efficiency would receive ! It is to further this latter end that this 
book has been prepared. Designed particularly for use by students 
of agriculture and home economics in secondary schools, its use will 
do much to increase the efficiency of the farm and the home. In 
the language of modern educational philosophy, it "functions in the 
life of the pupil." 

Useful facts rather than mere theory have been emphasized, 
although the theory has not been neglected. The practical char- 
/ acter of the work is indicated by the following selected chapter 
headings :

Practical Physics 



By N. HENRY BLACK of the Roxbury Latin School, 
Boston, and Professor HARVEY N. DAVIS of Harvard 
University. 

Clothe i2mo, illustrated^ 488 pages. List price^ %t,2S 

" In preparing this book," say the authors in the Preface, " we have tried to 
select only those topics which are of vital interest to young people, whether or 
not they intend to continue the study of physics in a college course. 

"In particular, we believe that the chief value of the informational side of 
such a course lies in its applications to the machinery of daily life. Everybody 
needs to know something about the working of electrical machinery, optical 
instruments, ships, automobiles, and all those labor-saving devices, such as 
vacuum cleaners, fireless cookers, pressure cookers, and electric irons, which 
are found in many American homes. We have, therefore, drawn as much of 
our illustrative material as possible from the common devices in modem life. 
We see no reason why this should detract in the least from the educational 
value of the study of physics, for one can learn to think straight just as well by 
thinking about an electrical generator, as by thinking about a Geissler tube. . . . 

" To understand any machine clearly, the student must have clearly in mind 
the fundamental principles involved. Therefore, although we have tried to 
begin each new topic, however short, with some concrete illustration familiar 
to young people, we have proceeded, as rapidly as seemed wise, to a deduction 
of the general principle. Then, to show how to make use of this principle, we 
have discussed other practical applications. We have tried to emphasize still 
further the value of principles, that is, generalizations, in science, by summariz- 
ing at the end of each chapter the principles discussed in that chapter. In 
these summaries we have aimed to make the phrasing brief and vivid so that 
it may be easily remembered and easily used." 

The new and noteworthy features of the book are the admirable 
selection of familiar material used to develop and apply the principles 
of physical science, the exceptionally clear and forceful exposition, 
showing the hand of the master teacher, the practical, interesting, 
thought-provoking problems, and the superior illustrations.

Botany for Secondary Schools 

By L. H. bailey 

Of Cornell University 

Cloth, i2mo, illustrated, ^ pages. List price, %us 

It is not essential nor desirable that everybody should become a botanist 
but it is inevitable that people shall be interested in the more human side 
of plant and animal life. We are interested in the evident things of natural 
history, and the greater our interest in such things, the wider is our horizon 
and the deeper our hold on life. 

The secondary school could not teach botanical science if it would ; lack of 
time and the immaturity of the pupils forbid it. But it can encourage a 
love of nature and an interest in plant study ; indeed, it can originate these, 
and it does. Professor Bailey's Botany has been known to do it. 

In the revision of this book that has just been made, the effective simplicity 
of the nature teacher and the genuine sympathy of the nature lover are as 
successfully blended as they were in the former book. Bailey's Botany for 
Secondary Schools recognizes four or five general life principles : that no 
two natural things are alike ; that each individual has to make and main- 
tain its place through struggle with its fellows ; that " as the twig is bent 
the tree inclines " ; that " like produces like," and so on. From these 
simple laws and others like them Professor Bailey proceeds to unfold a 
wonderful story of plant individuals that have improved upon their race 
characteristics, of plant communities that have adopted manners from 
their neighbors, of features and characteristics that have been lost by 
plants because of changed conditions of life or surroundings. The story 
vibrates with interest. 

The book is, moreover, perfectly organized along the logical lines of 
approach to a scientific subject. Four general divisions of material insure 
its pedagogical success : 

Part I.— The Plant Itself; 

Part II. — The Plant in Its Relation to Environment and to Man; 
Part III.— Histology, or the Minute Structure of Plants ; 
Part IV, — The Kinds of Plants, including a Flora of 130 pages.

Studies in Literature 



By FREDERICK MONROE TISDEL 

Assistant Professor of English in the University of Missouri. 

Clo^^ i2mo.y illustrated, jjj P^g^^* list price $.go 

In Part I of this book the author introduces the student to more than 
twenty standard English classics, giving in connection with each a brief 
explanatory introduction, suggestions for study and topics for oral and 
written discussion. These classics are grouped with respect to the dif- 
ferent types of literature which they represent, — epic, drama, essay, 
novel, etc., and there is a brief exposition of the type. The result is 
that in the mind of the reader the individual masterpiece and the type 
with its characteristics are inseparably connected. 

Part II consists of a brief but masterly survey of English literature. 
The book as a whole serves to systematize and unify the study of sec- 
ondary school literature, — a most desirable end. 

Professor E. A. Cross, State Teachers G)llege, Greeley, Colo. " It meets 
with my heartiest approval. It is brief, considers all the writers high school 
students need to know, touches the interesting features in the lives and works 
of these men, — about all you could want it to do." 

Mr. John B. Opdycke, English Department of the High School of Commerce, 
New York City. "I like it very much indeed. It has just enough in its re- 
view of the history of English literature, and its treatment of the classics is 
restrained and dignified. So far as I have seen, this is the only book that 
combines the two in one volume. I am all against the use of an abstract 
History of English Literature in the high school and I am all in favor of put- 
ting into the hands of the students some book that analyzes classics fully and 
yet with restraint. This book seems to have combined the two in just the 
right proportions and treated them in just the right manner,"

PREFACE 

This volume, like its companion, Shelter and Clothing, is in- 
tended for use in the course in household arts in the high 
school and normal school, whether the work be vocational or 
general in its aim. It is hoped that both volumes will prove 
useful in the home as well, including as they do a treatment 
of the homecrafts, and the related topics now so significant to 
the home maker, — the cost and purchasing of foods and 
clothing, the cost of operating, the management of the home, 
and questions of state and city sanitation vital to the health 
of the individual family. 

The volume treats specifically of foods, their production, 
sanitation, cost, nutritive value, preparation, and serving, these 
topics being closely interwoven with the practical aspects of 
household management, and they are followed by a study of 
the household budget and accounts, methods of buying, house- 
wifery, and laundering. It includes about 160 carefully se- 
lected and tested recipes, together with a large number of 
cooking exercises of a more experimental nature designed to 
develop initiative and resourcefulness. Shelter and Clothing 
deals with the organization and ideals of the home, house sani- 
tation, decoration, and furnishing ; and treats in full, textiles, 
sewing, costume design, and dressmaking. 

Some of the recipes here given are adapted from those of 
such authorities as Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Farmer, and Miss Bar- 
rows, and others are original and from private sources. 

The authors are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to 
those who have read and criticized the manuscript : Professor 



Vi PREFACE 

Mary Swartz Eose of Teachers College, for her criticism and 
contributions to the book ; Miss L. Ray Balderston, of Teach- 
ers College, for reading the chapters on Housewifery and 
Laundering ; Professor May B. Van Arsdale, of Teachers Col- 
lege, for reading the chapters on Pood ; Professor Van Ars- 
dale, Miss Bertha E. Shapleigh, and Miss Mary H. Peacock 
for their assistance in arranging for photographs ; Miss Laura 
B. Whittemore, formerly of Teachers College, and Miss Amy 
L. Logan of the Horace Mann School for criticizing the manu- 
script from the point of view of the high school teacher ; and 
also Professor Hermann Vulte for his kind assistance. 



SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 

The topics in this volume are so arranged that they can be 
followed in sequence as the course of study develops through 
the year, with such modifications as seem necessary to the 
teacher in order that the work may best meet the needs of the 
pupils. The practice has become quite general of beginning 
the practical work in the autumn with the preparation and 
preservation of fruit, especially for those pupils who have had 
previous work in foods ; and this plan commends itself as be- 
ing seasonable and as making an appeal to the interest of the 
pupils. The opening chapters furnish material that is in part 
preliminary and that may also be studied as the practical work 
progresses from Chapter V onward. The preparation of a 
meal need not be deferred until all types of dishes have been 
cooked singly, as it is possible to prepare a luncheon box, to 
set an invalid tray, or to serve a simple breakfast quite early 
in the course, provided the equipment permits. If the school 
program allows, it is well to give a period to recitation at 
stated intervals, which would include a discussion of the text 
and of problems that arise from the laboratory work. The 
cost of food is a topic to be borne in mind throughout the 
year. It is an excellent plan for the pupils to record the 
current prices of each food material as it is used, and the cost 
of a given dish for a given number of people, the topic culmi- 
nating in a detailed discussion when the chapter on the cost of 
food is read. A similar method may be pursued in connection 
with the nutritive values of food, the theme developing from 
lesson to lesson, until the pupils are ready for the chapter on 



viii SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 

menus and dietaries. An occasional lesson on housewifery or 
laundering may be introduced from time to time, if a complete 
sequence of lessons on these topics does not seem practicable ; 
and through the year the pupils may be encouraged to keep 
simple accounts for themselves and in connection with the 
supplies of the school kitchen. Those teachers are fortunate 
who may cooperate with a school lunch room, thus affording 
their pupils opportunity for dealing with practical administra- 
tive and economic problems. The way in which the topics are 
used must of necessity vary with the previous experience of 
the pupils, whether or not they have had cookery, chemistry, 
and physiology, and the teacher will use the exercises at the 
end of the chapters with freedom, omitting some questions, 
and adding others as the need arises.

FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD 
MANAGEMENT 

CHAPTER I 
FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 

Food problems. — " What shall I plan for the three 
meals ? " is a question as new each day as the day itself. 
That many women ask it, and are glad for an answer or a 
suggestion is proved by a glance at the daily or weekly paper 
or woman's magazine, whose publishers know that it pays 
to print menus innumerable. Indeed, the daily press is full 
of signs that the food problem is an acute one, for the cur- 
rent joke about food prices, the accounts of boycotts by house- 
keepers, popular articles on nutrition and pure foods, and the 
records of state and national legislation, all show that as a 
nation we are awake and seeking a way out of our present 
difficulties. 

Doubtless, the housekeeper has always found the task of 
supplying food to her family one of the most perplexing, but 
modern conditions have made the difficulties manifold when 
contrasted with olden times. A pretty picture of household 
management in seventeenth century England is drawn by Sir 
Walter Scott in " Peveril of the Peak." The lord of the 
castle has invited the village people to a great feast in cele- 
bration of the restoration of Charles the Second, and Lady 
Peveril finds her larder rather low. To be sure, there are 
b 1 



2 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

carp in the pond, and deer in the park, but the beef question 
is puzzling, for the steward does not wish to kill his choice 
steer. Then appear in the courtyard two fine oxen, and 
several wethers, or sheep, gifts from a neighbor, and the 
menu is complete. Lady Peveril is described as an excellent 
housekeeper, and doubtless felt burdened by many cares, 
but how different were her problems from ours, and how 
simple by comparison ! Beef trusts and the high price of 
beef, tuberculous cattle, unsanitary transportation and 
markets were not factors in her problem. In her day, and 
in the time of our grandmothers, less variety in diet was 
possible, and less expected except on state occasions; food 
was not transported over great distances, and the cost was 
not so much out of proportion to the average income. 

Now every large city, and even the small town, is the mar- 
ket of the world. We have long been accustomed to the im- 
portation of oranges and lemons, and dried fruits from distant 
lands ; but now we have peaches and pears from South Africa, 
melons from Spain, pineapples from the Azores, hothouse 
grapes from England, and apples from Australia, and in 
1913, we read of the shipment of beef from Argentina. In 
our own country, early fruits and vegetables travel from the 
south to the north, so that the season of some foods is long 
extended. The large amount of canned food also does away 
with the natural limits of the season, and this is further 
affected by cold storage. Both the quality and the cost 
of food are modified by these new methods of commerce, and 
furthermore, modern methods of manufacture have changed 
the quality. In an ideal community these changes would 
be for the better, but manufacturers often think more of 
their own profit than of the quality of their goods, and as a 
result adulterations have crept in, making necessary the 
enactment and enforcement of pure food laws. This is by 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 3 

no means so simple a matter as it seems, for we must first 
understand what pure food really is. 

Instinct guides somewhat in the selection of food where con- 
ditions of living are simple. Under more complex conditions 
there must be a scientific study of the whole situation in 
order that the individual may cope with it. Then, too, with 
such a variety of foods from which to select, it is easy to be 
tempted beyond our means, and to disregard the simple and 
the wholesome. We know that it is easy to develop a taste 
for some one food in excess, as for instance, sweets or dishes 
rich in fat and too highly flavored, and the physician adds his 
word here to the plea for a study of food and its functions. 

The conclusion is this, that the housekeeper who has the 
welfare of her family at heart will not 1 ' confine her interest 
in food to cooking processes and new recipes. Good cooks 
we must have, and our standard of cooking could easily be 
raised. But other facts about food are important to-day, and 
as we learn to prepare and serve food daintily, we must study 
such topics as the following : 

What food is, its composition and how it nourishes us; 
how it is manufactured and transported; "pure food"; 
sanitary and convenient markets ; the cost of food and how 
to buy; principles of food preparation; suitable combina- 
tions and amounts of food. These topics are all treated 
in this volume, and should be considered as important as the 
actual preparation of food. 

Food Materials 

What is food ? — This would seem to be a difficult ques- 
tion to answer as we look about a modern grocery or market 
with its bewildering assortment of foods. It seems hardly 
possible to describe such a variety of articles in a brief sen- 



4 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tence, or to find a definition that will apply to all. Yet we 
seem to know instinctively what food is, although we may 
not find it easy to give a definition. Even the lower animals 
are guided in selecting food by some natural instinct and 
seldom make a mistake. 

A widely used government bulletin gives this definition : 
" Food is that which taken into the body builds tissue or 
yields energy or does both." Probably we have learned this 
in our physiology, and admit it to be true, but for practical 
purposes, we need a more complete statement than this. 
Let us carefully determine what our foods really are, and 
what elements they contain, in order that we may select 
wisely for purposes of nutrition, and also that we may learn 
how to prepare food materials in a way that will utilize every- 
thing in them and waste nothing. 

Vegetable and animal foods. — It is easy to divide food 
materials in a general way into those derived from the vege- 
table kingdom and those derived from the animal kingdom. 
In the vegetable group we have first, the different parts of 
many plants, and second, substances manufactured from 
plants. While we do not usually eat the whole of any one 
plant, yet there is not any part of the plant that we have not 
adopted as food. We use roots and tubers in beets, carrots, 
and potatoes, and the onion is a bulb. In celery and 
asparagus we eat the plant stalk. Plant leaves give us 
lettuce and other salads, cabbage and the like. Peas and 
beans and nuts are seeds, and cauliflower is a part of the 
flower. The fruit as a whole is familiar in many forms. 
Manufactured vegetable food materials include flour, meals, 
breakfast cereals, starch, sugar, molasses and sirups. The 
animal kingdom gives us the flesh of animals, fish and shell 
fish, and substances derived from animals, like eggs, milk, 
and the milk products, cream, butter, and cheese. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 5 

These materials vary so much in appearance that they 
would seem to have nothing in common. If, however, we 
compare the food of different animals and different races of 
men,' we cannot but conclude that this is a mistaken judg- 
ment. We find an animal like the lion feeding entirely upon 
the flesh of other animals, and a strong creature like the ox, 
eating nothing but grass and grain. We also note that one 
race of men includes meat in its diet, and another subsists 
almost entirely upon vegetable food, such as rice and beans. 
Yet in both cases, these diverse kinds of food accomplish the 
same end, — body building and the supplying of energy. 
Let us study two common foods, from the two kingdoms, 
and see if through this study we can discover in what ways 
they are alike. 

Comparison of milk and beans. — A moment's thought 
enables us to see that in milk we have a food that must have 
all the elements needed in nutrition, since it is the only food 
taken by many young animals. The baby and the young 
calf find in it everything that is needed to build the growing 
body, and to give them energy. If you see a young calf 
frisking about the field, you can appreciate how well his food 
supplies his needs. 

A simple experiment will help us to find some of the sub- 
stances contained in milk. Let the milk stand until the 
cream rises on the top. Skim the cream, warm it slightly 
and beat it with an egg beater. Butter will soon " come," 
and butter, we know, is a form of fat. Warm a pint of the 
skimmed milk, add to it a dissolved rennet tablet, and set it 
in a warm place. In a short time, the milk becomes solidified 
to a consistency like that of jelly. If allowed to stand longer, 
a watery liquid will separate itself from the solid portion. 
These are the " curds and whey " that result, also, from 
the souring of milk. The whey can be squeezed out of the 



6 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

curd, leaving it quite dry. We have now found at least three 
constituents of milk, — water, fat, and curd. 

You may then surmise from the sweet taste of milk that 
sugar is present ; the chemist knows how to obtain it in 
pure form as " sugar of milk." The chemist also finds cer-

tain mineral substances which remain behind when all the 
water is evaporated and the curds and sugar burned away. 
These mineral substances are spoken of by the chemist as 
" ash," because this is what remains after burning the other 
pbrtions of a food material, as ashes remain from a wood fire. 
Figure 1 shows you these substances in the amounts in which 
each occurs in a pint of milk. The sugar is one of a class of 
substances to which the chemist gives the name carbohy- 
drate. To the substance in the curd that is different from 
all the other substances in the milk the name " protein " is 
given. 

We will now turn to the composition of beans, for in beans 
we find food stored up to nourish the young plant, which we, 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 7 

also, appropriate as food. The composition of both the milk 
and the beans is given in this table. Compare also Figures 
35 and 41.

Notice that the substances in the beans are the same in 
general nature as those in the milk, although the amounts are 
different. The water that the young plant needs is, of course, 
supplied from the earth. There is another difference to 
note although this is not shown in the table; in the beans 
the carbohydrate is of two kinds, sugar and starch. 



Foodstuffs 1 

All the varieties of food with which we are supplied will 
be found to contain some of these substances : protein, fat, 
carbohydrate, mineral matter, water ; and to these we give 
the name foodstuffs. Some food materials (like the milk 
and beans just studied) contain all the foodstuffs, some only 
one, as in the case of sugar. We can now define food as 
something that contains one or more of the substances 
known as foodstuffs. But what are the foodstuffs them- 
selves ? 

Elements in the foodstuffs. — Although we are not 
chemists, and may not even have taken a course in chemistry, 



'Teacher's Note. — The term "foodstuff" is used in place of "food 
principle," as being the later and better term. 



8 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

yet through our nature study or physiology lessons, we are 
familiar with the fact that all the materials about us, in- 
cluding our own bodies and our food, are made up of simple 
substances that we call " elements." We know, for instance, 
that coal is chiefly carbon, and we are familiar with such sub- 
stances as sulphur, calcium, phosphorus, and iron. We 
know that the air contains oxygen, which we inhale, and 
that we breathe out a combination of carbon and oxygen 
called " carbon dioxide." Since our bodies are composed 
of these and other elements, these elements must be supplied 
by our foods, and therefore, the foodstuffs in turn are com- 
posed of these same elements. 

Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates all contain large amounts 
of carbon, and on this account are called fuel foods. But 
proteins are distinguished because they contain nitrogen in 
addition, which is found in no other foodstuff. Sulphur, 
too, we get only from protein, but we need less of it than of 
nitrogen, so we think about the nitrogen and let the sulphur 
take care of itself. The nitrogen that we draw in from the 
air with every breath, we breathe out again without being 
able to use it. This element is necessary to every living cell, 
but we can make it ours only through our protein food. 
Nitrogen is cheapest when obtained from the grains, from 
dried beans and peas. We pay a higher price for it in milk, 
eggs, fish, meat, and nuts. Carbon, which is found in all 
foodstuffs except water and some kinds of mineral matter, 
costs much less, especially when we take it in the form of 
carbohydrates such as starches and sugars. Oxygen is also 
abundant in our foods, but we get it even more cheaply in 
water and by breathing it in from the air. Phosphorus, 
iron, and calcium are very important elements, but we do 
not need them in very large quantities. We can get them 
cheaply in whole grains, peas and beans, some fruits and 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 9 

green vegetables, but they are worth paying for in milk and 
eggs. The elements last mentioned are present in the food 
partly as constituents of certain proteins and fats, partly 
as mineral salts. Other elements found as mineral matter 
are sodium and chlorine (which we take as common salt), 
potassium, magnesium, and traces of iodine and fluorine. 
These are all necessary to keep our bodies in good working 
order. We shall see later how to select our food materials 
so as to have all the different elements in the foodstuffs 
present in sufficient amounts. 

Functions of the Foodstuffs 

Food for energy. — The first requirement of the body is 
for fuel, because it has a great deal of work to do. Even 
when one lies perfectly quiet and appears to be resting, the 
heart is working to keep up the circulation of the blood, the 
chest and diaphragm muscles are working to maintain the 
oxygen supply to the lungs, the alimentary tract is moving 
food material along, working to digest it and get rid of waste, 
and the skeletal muscles are being held up to " tone " so as 
to be ready for further action. All this work that we scarcely 
realize, may be called involuntary. To it we may add all 
sorts of voluntary movements, from simply speaking a word 
to turning somersaults or lifting heavy weights. All work 
involves energy, which we can obtain only from the fuel foods, 
proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 

Energy takes different forms. Our supply comes from the 
sun in the forms of heat and light, and plants store it up in 
the form of chemical energy when they build carbohydrates, 
fats, and proteins. This may be changed into the forms of 
work or of heat when we eat the food. Whenever an attempt 
is made to change chemical energy to work, some of it will 



10 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

change to heat. So in our bodies, the fuel foods, which 
enable us to do both involuntary and voluntary work, fur- 
nish heat at the same time, to keep our bodies warm. When 
we are too cold, we can shiver or run or jump, and thus, by 
doing more work, get more heat too. 

The unit of fuel value. — ■ In our studies of food materials, 
we must find out just how much energy, or working power, 
can be obtained from each kind. We must have a measure 
of energy or fuel value ; and just as the inch is a measure of 
length, and the pound of weight, so the Calorie serves as a 
measure of fuel value. This unit ' measures energy as heat, 
being the amount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of 
water 1° C. (or 1 pound of water about 4° F.), but we can 
express it also as work, being sufficient energy to raise a 
1-pound weight 3087 feet into the air (or 1 ton about lj feet) 
if it were possible to convert it into mechanical work without 
loss. By burning foods in pure oxygen in a vessel placed in 
water so that all the heat is given off to the water, and then 
noting the change in temperature of the water, it is possible 
to find out just how much energy each will yield. Such a 
device is called a calorimeter. In the body there is usually a 
small portion of each kind of foodstuff which escapes diges- 
tion, and protein is not quite so completely burned as in the 
calorimeter. When allowance for the probable loss is made, 
the energy values of the fuel foodstuffs are as follows : 

Protein . . .4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. 

Fat ... ... 9 Calories per gram or 4082 per pound. 

Carbohydrate . . . 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. 

The standard portion. — ■ Knowing the composition of any 
food material, it is possible from these figures to calculate 

'This is the "greater calorie" or "kilogram calorie,'' and is written 
Calorie to distinguish it from the "lesser calorie" or "gram calorie," largely 
used in physics and chemistry. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 11 

the total fuel value, or we can refer to tables in which this 
has been calculated, and save ourselves labor. For com- 
parison of different foods the Standard, or 100-Calorie, 
Portion is used, as this corresponds very closely with the 
amount of food for a single serving in many cases. In the 
sections treating of different foods the Standard Portion will 
be stated. 

Food for body building. — Every living cell has a little 
life history of its own, and constantly demands a certain 
amount of new material to replace old which it has worn out. 
Besides this, old cells die, and new ones have to be made to 
replace them. Hence even a full-grown person needs build- 
ing material, and much more is required in proportion when 
the person is growing and perhaps adding several ounces 
a week to his weight. The foodstuffs which have especial 
value as building material are protein and mineral matter. 

Food for body regulating. — To help in the digestion of 
food, to keep the blood in proper condition, the muscles 
supple, and all the processes of the body at their best, ash 
constituents and water in the diet are necessary. A tabular 
summary of the functions of the foodstuffs and an outline of 
the changes which take place in digestion will be found in the 
appendix. 

We are now able to give a more complete answer to our 
question, " What is Food? " 

Food has been said to be that which taken into the body 
builds tissue or yields energy, or both. The food as a whole 
must contain all the chemical elements needed by the body, 
these elements being supplied in substances known as food- 
stuffs, viz., protein, fat, carbohydrates, mineral matter or 
ash, water. To be a food, a substance must contain one or 
all of the foodstuffs. 

It must be noted here that our food materials as bought, 



12 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

contain inedible matter, as in the shells of eggs, the bone of 
meat, the skins and pods of vegetables. Moreover, the fiber 
that we eat in vegetable foods is not digested under ordinary- 
circumstances, but seems rather to serve a useful purpose in 
giving bulk to our foods. 

Food adjuncts. — In preparing foods for the table, we 
have the habit of adding substances to develop or give flavor. 
With the exception of sugar, which we use largely for its 
agreeable taste, these substances have no nutritive value. 
They are not hurtful unless used in excess, although pepper 
and other spices sometimes disturb digestion. Pepper, too, 
irritates a delicate throat. 

Only a few flavors are really detected by the sense of 
taste. These are salt, sugar, acids; and something in the 
spices that gives a sensation hard to describe, but is unmis- 
takable in an overdose of mustard or horse-radish. " Pun- 
gent " is the descriptive word for such a flavor. 

The other flavors are really odors, and are detected by 
the sense of smell. Have you not at some time seemed to 
lose the sense of taste when suffering from a severe cold in 
the head? Yet even then you could taste sugar, salt, 
vinegar, and feel the pungency of pepper. These other 
flavors or odors are due to a volatile oil in the flavoring 
material, that is, an oil that readily evaporates, especially 
when heated, as distinguished from the non-volatile oils and 
fats like olive oil and butter. This is a practical bit of knowl- 
edge in our cookery, for whatever passes off as fragrance 
during the cooking process, is lost as flavor. For instance, 
to cook vanilla essence in a soft custard is equivalent to 
throwing most of it away. 

Salt. — A mineral substance that develops other flavors. It 
should not be used in excess. A small amount is desirable even in 

sweet dishes. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 13 

Adds. — Vinegar, lemon juice, and juices of other sour fruits. 
These are pleasing in themselves, and in small quantities develop 
other flavors and give a certain brightness of taste. They are 
used with meat and fish, and in sweet dishes. 

Spices. — Red, black, and white pepper, cinnamon, cloves, all- 
spice, nutmeg, mace, and ginger are examples. They are made 
from the seeds of certain plants, used whole or ground. Stick cinna- 
mon is a layer of a stem. Ginger is a root. 

Herbs. — Thyme, mint, sweet marjoram, summer savory are 
the leaves of old-fashioned pot herbs, used either fresh or dried. 
There were many others used in olden days' that are not common 
now, such as sweet basil and pot marigold. A quite complete list 
will be found nowadays in any good seed catalogue. These herbs 
are used with meat dishes. 

Vegetable flavors. — Celery seeds and stalks, onions, leek and 
garlick, carrots and turnips, all contain flavoring oils, and we use 
them for their flavors in small portions, in meat dishes. 

Essences. — The oils of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon and orange 
peel are dissolved in alcohol, and used in liquid form in cakes and 
desserts. Violet leaves and violet essence are sometimes used, but 
are a fad as a flavor. Rose water made from rose leaves is an old- 
fashioned flavoring, used infrequently now in blancmanges. The 
fresh leaf of a rose geranium gives a pleasing flavor, for occasional 
use. Chocolate, coffee, and tea are used for flavorings as well as for 
beverages. 

Coloring substances. — These come of many colors made from 
aniline dyes, and while probably not often hurtful, they should be 
used only in sweets and candies, and very seldom, if ever. It is 
better to depend on natural fruit coloring when color is wanted. 

The fine art of cooking is to develop the natural flavor of 
each foodstuff by the proper application of heat, and never 
to use these condiments and flavorings in excess. The artist 
in cookery has a gift for flavoring, somewhat as the painter 
has for color. 

Beverages. — The dictionary defines " beverage " as 
" drink of any kind." The word is used in different forms in 
several languages and is traced back to the Latin bibere, 



14 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT' 

to drink. The common beverages will be studied in detail 
in connection with their preparation. They have slight 
nutritive value, save for the added milk, cream, and sugar. 
Cocoa and chocolate contain fat, and so have to be classed 
as foods. Milk is not a beverage, strictly speaking, but a 
food, and should be counted as a part of a meal.

KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 

There is no more attractive room than a well-fitted kitchen, 
shining with cleanliness ; and the kitchen furnishings should 
have their fair share of the money spent in buying furniture 
for the house. 

A spotless cleanliness is the standard for the kitchen, and

making cleanliness easily possible. Next in order is fore- 
thought in securing the comfort and convenience of the 
worker.

Plan of the kitchen. — Here the motto should be " Save 
steps." How many weary miles do women walk within their 
kitchen walls because the sink, the stove, the refrigerator 
and the closets for food and dishes are put in to fit the spaces 
allowed by the windows and doors, with no thought of the 
rapid and easy dispatch of work. 

Figure 2 shows the plan of a kitchen, of the " buffet " type, 
suitable for a small home or apartment. As this plan is 
drawn it would be necessary to use either electric apparatus,

or a small gas stove upon one of the tables. A large gas 
stove could stand in place of the table at (1), or 'against the 
wall at (2), pushing the table at (3) nearer the door. The 
cupboards at (4) and (5) should be raised, leaving table 
space at both the right and left of the sink. Notice that the 
ice box is in the entry, and also that there is a cupboard that 
could be used for food. The china cupboard is conveniently 
near in the dining-room. 

Figure 3 shows a larger kitchen, with a serving room be- 
tween it and the dining-room. The ice box is in the outer 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 17 

wall and is filled from the outside. The cupboard at (1) could 
hold the cooking utensils, as it stands conveniently between 
the sink and the range. A kitchen as large as this should 
have a small table on rollers for carrying food materials and 
utensils back and forth. If you have ever visited the kitchen 
in a dining-car you will realize that compactness is one 
of the advantages of the small kitchen over the large, although 
the latter may be better ventilated and cooler. 

Furnishing the kitchen. — The walls and floors, and even 
the ceiling, should be washable. A tiled wall is as easy to 
wash as a china dish, but the expense is prohibitive in many 
cases. Table oilcloth for wall and ceiling is very satis- 
factory ; next to this in desirability is paint, and for the last 
choice a washable paper. This paper will bear scarcely 
more than a damp, cloth for cleansing purposes, however. 
Avoid cracks and crevices in the woodwork, having all 
surfaces as plain as possible. 

The best floor is one covered with an inlaid linoleum, 
which gives warmth and comfort to the foot, is easy to clean, 
and wears for many years (Fig. 4). It should be cemented 
down at the edges that no dust may collect. The first cost 
is rather high, but it pays in the end. A hardwood floor of 
maple or yellow pine is also satisfactory. Tiling is the 
cleanest of all floorings, but is very fatiguing to the worker. 

Enamel-paint makes a smooth finish for the woodwork. 
In the kitchen of the future, which will be fireproof, steel 
fittings will probably take the place of all wood. 

Have harmonious colors in the kitchen. Decide upon a 
cheerful color scheme, and carry it out in all the fittings. 
One most attractive kitchen is furnished in soft brown and 
buff, with a touch of blue in the linoleum on the floor. Figure 
4 shows the interior of a small kitchen, practical for a family 
of six or eight. The curtain at the window, which gives a

touch of daintiness, is of a washable material. Figure 5 shows 
a much larger kitchen, with two sinks, and a work-table in 
the center. See how conveniently the refrigerator is placed for 
serving, and for returning food from the serving room to the 




refrigerator. The vegetable sink is near the stove, and the 
utensils, too, are near by. A rolling table is seen at the left. 
No plan can be drawn that would be perfect in all situations. 
If you ever have the opportunity to plan your own kitchen, 
decide just what you want it to contain, and then plan the 
places for each article. Sometimes there are too many drawers 
and shelves, and these not of the right size or position. 



20 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The kitchen table. — The table should have a top with 
room for food materials and utensils to stand in neat order 
without crowding. Glass is the cleanest top, painted steel 
and hard maple coming next in order. Have some arrange- 
ment of shelves and drawers that small utensils and some food 
materials may be always at hand. Figure 6 shows a kitchen 
" cabinet " of painted steel with such conveniences. Notice 
the bin for flour, and the inverted jar for sugar, both with an 
opening at the bottom. Spices and flavorings and materials 
needed in small quantities are kept in jars on the shelves. 
The cupboard and drawers beneath will hold small utensils, 
towels, and whatever proves to be needed close by. Several 
makes of such cabinets are now on sale. A flat-topped table 
for a large kitchen, Fig. 5, could have drawers and cup- 
boards below. If the outlay for a cabinet seems too great, 
the bins for sugar and flour may be purchased separately 
and fastened on the wall above the table, and one or two 
shelves screwed on the wall for the jars, with hooks fastened 
in underneath on which a few small utensils may be hung. 

A small rolling table may be made inexpensively by putting 
castors on a light table costing not more than a dollar. Put 
table oilcloth over the top. This is a great convenience in 
many ways. The height of the table should be such that the 
worker is not fatigued by bending over. Thirty-two inches 
is a good table height for a woman of five feet four or five 
inches. Blocks hollowed to fit the table legs may be used 
with a table of ordinary height for a tall person. 

Cupboards and shelves. — If you purchase a cupboard 
see that the shelves are movable, and of varying widths. 
There are a few large utensils that need a deep shelf, about 
fifteen inches. If the shelves are to be built in, provide several 
widths from six to ten inches. Much space is sometimes 
wasted between shelves. Vary the distances here.

tank fastened to the range. If gas is used, have some kind 
of gas water heater that will give a sufficient flow for dish- 
washing and cleaning purposes. A boiler may be heated 
with a kerosene stove. The boiler should be fastened above

sene stove. Have a faucet in the boiler. Wherever a boiler 
is used it is economy to have it covered with some non- 
conducting material, just as steam pipes are packed. 

Utensils. — The expert cook is known by the small number 
of utensils that she uses. If you watch the expert at work, 
you will see too, that each utensil is exactly fitted to its use. 

The skilled cook is like the carpenter or painter, and her 
set of tools is individual. The list given on page 28 is a 
sample one, to be changed to suit the individual preference, 
and increased as the need arises; it could be smaller, if 



26 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

necessary. When you first furnish a kitchen, avoid an 
elaborate display of tools, beginning with the few essentials 
only. 

No one material is suitable for the construction of all 
utensils. Those subjected to intense heat must be of material 
able to resist it. The material for a given utensil must be se- 
lected with the purpose of the utensil in mind. The material 
should be durable, easy to clean, and of such a nature that 
it does not affect chemically the food material cooked in it. 

Aluminium. — A white metal, fairly durable, very light in weight. 
Discolors easily, and is not easy to clean. Expensive. Used for all 
kinds of utensils. 

Copper. — Endures heat, durable, fairly light to handle. Hard 
to keep clean. Expensive. Used for kettles. Not desirable for 
family use. 

Earthenware. — Will not endure the highest temperatures with- 
out crackling. Easily breakable. Easy to clean, unless crackled. 
Inexpensive. Useful for slow oven processes, for pitchers and mix- 
ing bowls. 

Enamel. — A vitrified material upon iron or steel. The English 
enamel ware upon iron is durable, excellent for preserving, heavy. 
The German and American enamels are lighter. Avoid the attrac- 
tive blue, and blue and white except for pitchers, cups, bowls, and 
plates. They crackle and chip off more easily with heat then the 
gray enamels. One German make, of a dark mottled gray, is less 
brittle in the finish than most American makes. All the enamels 
are easy to keep clean. Used for kettles, saucepans, roasting, 
and baking. Less durable than steel and iron. 

Iron. — Endures intense heat. Durable. Heavy to handle. 
Becomes smooth with long use, and then is not difficult to clean. 
Affects the color of acid fruits. Not expensive. Used for frying 
kettles and pans and kettles for boiling. 

Russia iron is a sheet iron of good quality for roasting and 
bread pans. Expensive. 

Steel. — Endures intense heat. Durable. Medium weight. 
Fairly easy to clean. Affects acid fruits. Medium cost. Same 
uses as iron, also for roasting and baking pans, and smaller kettles. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 27 

Tin. '■ — Tin, a " useful metal," is plated on thin sheet iron for 
utensils. So called block tin is the best quality. Will not endure 
intense heat. The tin wears and scratches off with use. Not 
easy to clean. Discolors easily, and colors acid fruit. Poor tin 
ware is not worth buying. Good quality is not cheap. May be 
used for measures, and for small saucepans, but is less desirable 
than other wares. 

Wooden ware. — Used for molding boards, meat boards, and 
spoons. 

The patterns of utensils. — Select those made without 
seams, or flirtings, where food particles collect. Bowls, 
saucepans, and kettles should have a lip on the side, for the 
pouring out of liquids. A pitcher should be of such shape 
that it can be easily washed, and it should have a lip that 
will pour well. A pot for boiling coffee should have a lip 
and not a spout. Select utensils with non-conducting 
handles. 

Study carefully the selection of knives, and do not try to 
economize in their purchase. Knives must be sharp, and 
poor quality steel will never take a good edge. A worn table 
knife of Sheffield steel, when ground down, makes the best of 
kitchen knives. Buy a good sharpener and use it frequently. 

Labor-saving devices. — A good machine saves the wear 
and tear of human muscle, and also much time. If you have 
studied the principles of the lever and other mechanical 
devices, you will understand why this is. 1 

Learn to pay for, use, and clean good machines.

bread mixer and meat chopper, because they are harder to 
clean than the bowl and spoon and knife.

and is cleaner than the wooden chopping bowl.

Care of the kitchen. — The daily cleaning must include 
the care of the sink and traps, the cleaning of the stove, 
brushing the floor, and washing off of tables. More thorough 
cleaning includes the scrubbing of the floor, washing of walls, 
woodwork, and windows^ cleaning of closets and drawers. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 31 

The stoves should be rubbed often with paper, and washed 
thoroughly when necessary. Great pains must be taken to 
keep the ovens clean, by frequent washing out. Gas burners 
must be taken off and boiled in a solution of sal soda 
once in a while. The top and bottom of coal ovens should 
be cleaned out once a month. Kerosene stoves need con- 
stant cleaning. Stove blacking makes the stove more 
attractive. 

Dish-washing. — It is not difficult to wash dishes well, 
although many people make it a very disagreeable process. 
The necessary apparatus is given in the utensil list. The 
cleansing materials include a plentiful supply of hot water, 
a good soap, ammonia or borax to soften the water, a gritty 
soap or powder. Have a pan for washing and another for 
rinsing, and a tray for draining if there is no drainer attached 
to the sink. 

Order of work. — Prepare the dishes by scraping and neatly 
piling articles of a kind together. Rub greasy dishes with soft 
paper, and put water and ammonia or washing powder into utensils 
that need soaking. Have clean towels at hand. Make ready a 
pan of hot soap suds, by using a soap shaker, or soap solution, but 
do not put the cake of soap in the pan. Have rinsing water ready. 

Wash the cleanest dishes first, usually the glasses, next the cups 
and saucers, and the silver next. Have the soiled dishes near the 
pan, and put in only one or two articles at a time, washing with 
mop or dish cloth. To pile in a number means the nicking of 
china, and scratching of silver. Dip each dish in the rinsing water 
and then put in the drainer. If there is not room for two pans, 
the dishes may be piled on the drainer not too many at a time, 
and the rinsing water poured over. Be careful not to use too hot 
water for delicate china and glass. Change the soapy water when 
it becomes in the least greasy. 

Wipe the dishes while they are still warm, and use dry towels. 

Wash the utensils thoroughly, especially on the bottom. Heavy 
utensils can be dried without wiping, on or near the stove. Do 
not put any utensils away until they are perfectly dry. 



32 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Steel knives should be scoured and thoroughly rinsed and 
dried. Wash out the towels and dishpan, and leave the sink and 
drainboard perfectly clean. It does take time and work for this 
whole process, but spotless cleanliness is our aim. 1 

Home dish-washers are being devised, and should save some of 
the labor. None as yet has proved very satisfactory.

CHAPTER III 
FUEL AND STOVES 

The fuels most widely used in this country are coal, gas, 
and kerosene. Wood is still used for cooking by those who 
own wood lots, or who live in a district where wood is abun- 
dant, but in a sense it is the fuel of the past. Electricity is 
generated from coal except in the few communities where 
the electric current is derived through machinery from the 
energy of falling water but electricity is not in common 
household use, and is still the method of the future for the 
average family. Other substances are burned for fuel 
occasionally or in restricted localities. Corn cobs are used 
sometimes in the corn belt. Peat is an old-world fuel. 
It is a vegetable substance taken in blocks from marshes, 
in reality the first stage of coal formation. It is a slow-burning 
fuel which is cheap in its own locality. 

Economy of fuel is a world problem, for it is evident that 
the coal supply will be exhausted in course of time, and this 
is true also of coal oil or petroleum. Scientists are experi- 
menting to discover practical methods, not dependent upon 
the burning of coal, for generating electricity. Water power 
is the only practicable method so far, and to make it per- 
manently available we must conserve the forests still remain- 
ing to us, and thus safeguard the sources of our rivers. 

Another effort toward economy is seen in the use for fuel 

of waste products treated in some way to make them readily 

combustible. The briquet is used in Europe where the fuel 

supply is limited. It is made of sawdust or waste coal, with 

d 33 



34 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

some petroleum, tar, resin, or other substance, heated together 
and molded. Good briquets yield a large amount of heat in 
proportion to bulk and weight. The problem here, as with 
all waste, is to find a manufacturing process that will make 
the product cheap enough to be practical for 'common 
use. 

It is a natural impulse to use lavishly whatever is at hand 
in abundance, and it is only a highly civilized community 
that takes thought for the economy of the future. Con- 
sidered only from a selfish point of view, however, with coal 
and petroleum at the high prices that are likely to prevail, 
the saving of fuel is one of our most important economies. , 

The common fuels. — Coal is of two kinds, anthracite 
and bituminous, or hard and soft. Hard coal of good quality 
has 90 per cent or more of carbon, and burns with little 
flame. Soft coal contains as much as 18 per cent of flame- 
making substances, and gives off a heavy smoke. Hard 
coal is therefore cleaner, but it is more costly than soft coal, 
because the supply is smaller. The most important anthra- 
cite mines are found in the eastern United States, and hard 
coal is used more in this section than elsewhere. Good hard 
coal may be recognized by its glossy black color and bright 
surfaces. It is sold under different names taken often from 
the locality where it is mined. There are two kinds, one 
leaving a reddish ash, and the other a white. The red ash 
coal burns more freely than the white ash and the ash is 
heavier and therefore cleaner. The price is higher per ton 
or bag. 

Coal is sorted in different sizes, a medium size being best 
for the ordinary range. Poor coal has slaty pieces in it, 
that will not burn but break up and mingle with the ashes. 
You can learn to detect it by the slaty color. Clinkers are 
formed by unburnable minerals, mixed with the coal, that 



FUEL AND STOVES 35 

melt and stick together, and even adhere to the lining or the 
grate. They are not often troublesome in the cooking range. 

Coal is measured by the ton of two thousand pounds avoir- 
dupois. A common hod of coal holds about thirty pounds. 
Coal should be bought in large quantity, and stored away 
in summer, if possible. The retail dealer in the city often 
charges an- exorbitant sum for coal by the bag, so that the 
buyer of small quantities pays a much higher price for a ton 
bought in this way. The wholesale price of coal has 
increased on an average about 13 per cent since 1900. 

Coke is the solid substance remaining after gas has been 
made from certain kinds of coal, and is sometimes sold by 
gas companies, as a by-product. It is light, and therefore 
easy to handle and does not smoke, but it burns out quickly, 
and the fire of coke requires frequent replenishing. It is 
sold by the bag, or in large quantities by the ton, also some- 
times by the chaldron, an old English measure for coal, 
containing from thirty-two to thirty-six bushels. 

Gas was used for illuminating long before it came into 
common use for heating and cooking. Commercial gas 
manufactured for both lighting and cooking is really a mix- 
ture of various gases. One method produces it from bitu- 
minous coal heated in retorts. Another method gives 
lf water gas," by passing steam through heated coal. The 
value of gas will depend upon the components of the mixture, 
and the manufacturer has an opportunity to make an in- 
ferior gas unless the law stipulates what the quality shall 
be. 

The small town or country dweller may use a gas machine 
on the premises, the gas to be stored or generated in some 
tank in the ground, and piped into the house. Acetylene, 
a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is used in this way. 
Acetylene has a low flashing point, and there is question as to 



36 



FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



its safety. One firm sends a mixed gas of good quality in 
metal bottles to the consumer, the bottles being placed in a 
metal closet above ground outside the house. The firm 
claims that an explosion has never occurred. 

Gas is measured by the cubic foot, and its price estimated 
per 1000 cubic feet. The amount is recorded on a meter as 
the gas passes into the house. See Fig. 13. It is an easy 
matter to learn to read a meter, and every one should do so

who uses gas. Always compare the gas bill with the amount 
recorded by the meter. If the gas bill becomes larger than 
usual, and you feel sure that the consumption has been nor- 
mal, report the matter to the company. A meter may be 
out of order, and need repair. 

To read the meter. — Figure 13 shows the three dials found 
on the face of a gas meter. The arrows show the direction. 
The dial at the right indicates 100 cubic feet between the 
numbers, the middle dial 1000 and the left hand dial 10,000. 
The dials in this figure record 53,250 cubic feet. The price 
of gas varies from eighty cents to a dollar and a half per 
thousand cubic feet. " Eighty-cent gas " is the hope of many 
a consumer. At a dollar and a half it is not a cheap fuel. 



FUEL AND STOVES 37 

Gas does away with the handling of coal and ashes in the 
kitchen and is thus a clean and labor-saving fuel. It gives 
an intense heat the moment the flame is lighted and this heat 
is easily regulated in a well-made stove. The flame should 
burn with a clear blue or greenish color. With a properly 
constructed stove only a small percentage of the heat is lost. 
In all these points it has the advantage over coal. The 
comparative cost is studied in the problems on page 53. 

Natural gas is used in those regions where it occurs, piped 
to the house from a central source. It is found in limited 
areas only, and in some places has already been exhausted. 
Coal oil, or petroleum, sometimes found oozing from crevices 
in rocks, or even floating on water, is a natural inflammable 
oil stored in the earth. It was known in ancient Persia, 
Greece, and Rome, but did not become of great commercial 
importance until the middle of the nineteenth century. It is 
now obtained by boring wells, and is found in great quantities 
in certain regions of the country. The crude oil yields many 
products valuable in the arts, medicine, and manufacture. 
Kerosene is the substance useful as a fuel and for giving 
light. When of good quality it is nearly colorless, and the 
flashing point should be 149° F., or 65° C. This flashing 
point is the temperature at which the vapor from the kero- 
sene explodes or flashes. If the vapor flashes at a point 
lower than this, it means that the oil has not been suffi- 
ciently refined ; that is, in the process of manufacture the 
substances that flash at a low temperature have not been 
removed, and therefore the oil is less safe. 

Kerosene is sold by the gallon or barrel. The price for a 

jgood quality is about seventy cents for a five-gallon can. 

' By the barrel a saving is made of several cents a gallon. It 
is useful as a fuel to those housekeepers who cannot have 
gas, and who find it a convenient substitute for coal in the 



38 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

summer. With the new blue flame stoves it gives an intense 
heat, easily regulated. There is no heavy labor involved 
in its use, but even the best stove requires constant care and 
watchfulness. It is not so clean and easy to use as gas. The 
kerosene supply should be kept in a cool place, and stoves 
and lamps should never be filled by candle or lamplight. 

Gasolene is used as a fuel for cooking in some places, but 
in others the fire insurance companies have such strict rules 
in regard to it that its use is practically prohibited. It i» 
more volatile than kerosene, and its flashing point is very 
low. Kerosene is much safer for household use. 

Alcohol is used with the chafing dish. Denatured alcohol 
is so cheap in Germany that it is used in large and especially 
adapted stoves for cooking purposes. There are denatured 
alcohol stoves on the market here, but they are little used. 

Charcoal, wood partially burnt out, is little used for do- 
mestic purposes now. 

The relative value of the common fuels is stated in quan- 
tities as follows, but this is of course dependent on the quality 
of the coal and the gas. One thousand feet of gas about 
equals from fifty to sixty pounds of coal, or four and one half 
gallons of kerosene; and one half ton of coal approximates 
a cord of wood. 

Those who may be interested will find a fuller discussion 
of fuels and fuel values in Snell's " Elementary Household 
Chemistry." 

Electricity is not a fuel, but is classed here as a source of 
heat. It may be supplied for cooking purposes by any com- 
pany that furnishes electric fight, and should be available 
in the country wherever an electric trolley runs. The energy 
supplied is measured and paid for by the kilowatt ; that is, 
one thousand watts. The terms used for electrical measure- 
ments cannot be really understood until one has studied 



FUEL AND STOVES 39 

electricity. It may be said, however, that the ampere l is 
the unit of current strength, the volt is the unit of electrical 
pressure or electromotive force, the watt is the unit of elec- 
trical power and the basis of payment for current supplied 
for heating or lighting. 

Voltage, amperage, and watt or kilowatt are the terms 
in common use. If you read the circulars that advertise 
electric cooking apparatus, you will find the request to state 
the voltage of your electric current in ordering a piece of 
apparatus. Or again, the number of watts used per hour is 
given, with the catalogue number and the size of an electric 
stove. 

The cost of electricity per kilowatt (usually from ten to 
fifteen cents) varies in different localities. 

The great advantage of electricity is that little heat is 
lost in radiation, and that the degree of heat is well under 
control. There are also no products of combustion present, 
and this is the only source of heat for cooking of which this 
is true. Both gas and kerosene vitiate the air to some extent. 

Cooking apparatus. — ■ The wastefulness of cooking opera- 
tions, past and present, is due largely to the defects of the 
apparatus used. The open fireplace for wood, and the open 
grate for coal, are two arrangements that permit most of 
the heat to pass up the chimney, and into the room. See 
Frontispiece and Fig. 14. In Fig. 14 there is illustrated at 
the right a brick oven with a flue opening into the chimney. 
This was one of the earliest inventions for saving fuel and 
heat. This oven was lined with brick or stone, and the fire 
of wood was built in it, and allowed to remain until it had

work in electricity. Volta was an Italian who invented an electric battery ;

burned out. The coals and ashes were removed, and when 
the brick had cooled somewhat cakes and pies were put in 
to bake. This oven retained its heat for twenty-four hours, 
and beans put in Saturday afternoon were taken out hot for 
the Sunday morning breakfast. The method was clumsy, 
but a good heat saver.

Figure 15 is an American stove, early nineteenth century, 
wood the fuel ; and from this form, modified for using coal, 
has developed the modern American coal range (Fig. 18). 
Even the latest types are very wasteful of heat. Stoves 
like that shown in Fig. 19 have been devised for use with 
gas. Even with these only a small percentage of the heat 
generated is available for cooking. 

The ideal system is that which gives the largest possible 
percentage of its heat for cooking, and puts the degree of 



FUEL AND STOVES 41 

heat under quick control with the greatest saving of fuel, 
and of labor in operating. This does not mean that the

stove which gives the most intense heat is the best, although 
some stoves seem to be constructed with that as the aim. 

Let us consider some of the methods of saving heat, and 
study different kinds of apparatus with this knowledge in mind. 



42 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We recall the fact, first, that some substances are good 
conductors of heat, and others poor. 1 If you hold a metal 
poker in your hand, and place the other end in red hot coals, 
you will realize that metal is a rapid conductor of heat. If 
the poker has a wooden handle, the heat of the coals does 
not readily reach your hand, for the wood is a poor conductor. 
Moreover, this good conductor is a poor holder of heat, the 
heat radiating rapidly from it into the surrounding air, but 
the poor conductor, once thoroughly heated, cools off slowly. 

You can think of many illustrations from your daily life. Why 
do you prefer a woolen blanket on a cool night, rather than a linen 
sheet, merely ? Why do you use a cloth holder in ironing ? What 
is the principle of a hot water bottle ? Air is a poor conductor. Can 
you think of an illustration of this? What is the principle of a 
thermos bottle ? 

It is not difficult to see how these facts apply in our cooking 
apparatus. From an oven with metal sides heat is lost by 
radiation. In a double oven, with an air space between 
the inner and outer part, some heat is saved. If the outer 
cover is of some non-conducting material, even less radiation 
takes place. This is the principle of the oven devised by 
Mr. Edward Atkinson. Here the inner oven is of sheet 
iron, and the outer covering of a non-conducting material, 
some composition with wood pulp or paper as the basis. If 
in this way heat can be trapped, as it were, in an oven, it 
will follow that less heat will have to be supplied, and we can 
use a smaller amount of fuel. This is the case in the Atkin- 
son oven (Fig. 16), where the source of heat is either a kero- 
sene lamp, or a small Bunsen burner of the rose type, which 
uses only a small amount of gas. 



1 Teacher's Note . — The teacher of physics can cooperate here, and indeed 
throughout the whole topic of apparatus and cooking processes. 



FUEL AND STOVES 



43 



Another illustration of the conserving of heat by the pre- 
vention of radiation is in the fireless cooker. This is a method 
used in Sweden in simple form, and adapted and improved 
to suit modern needs. Heat is supplied in the first place by 
gas or kerosene, and the water in the vessel containing the 
food is raised to the boiling point, and held there in some 
cases for a few minutes. The vessel is- then placed in the 
" cooker," which is a box with thick walls of some non-con- 
ducting material, and the heat already 
present is sufficient to finish the cook- 
ing process, since the radiation is very 
slow. In some cookers a heated stone 
is introduced to raise the temperature 
slightly. Both of these devices are ex- 
cellent for the long, slow cooking that 
seems to mellow the food material and 
develop the flavors that do not result 
from rapid cooking. 

At the same time, we need rapid pro- 
cesses, such as broiling and toasting, 
which give characteristic flavors. To 
meet this double need, a new type of 
gas stove has been made. See Fig 17. 

This is a gas stove, where the oven 
has thick walls of a non-conducting material. The oven is 
heated, for a short time only, the gas flame being cut off when 
the oven has reached the desired temperature. At the left 
is an attachment where rapid cooking may be accomplished 
when desired, and there is a device at (1) with the same prin- 
ciple as the tireless cooker, or the tea " cosey." This cover is 
dropped over the kettle when the boiling point is reached, the 
flame is turned out, and the heat in the water finishes the 
process. There is no good reason why stoves embodying

this same principle should not be used with kerosene, and 
with the electric current. Improved stoves of this type will 
be constructed, and certainly will tend toward great economy 
of fuel. 

One method of saving fuel is by the use of a steam cooker, 
which consists of a series of compartments, one above an-

other, containing several kinds of food, all to be cooked over 
the same burner, either gas or kerosene, or on one section of 
the top of the coal range when space is being used for the 
wash boiler or irons. 

It requires intelligence to use such devices, and those who 
lack it cling obstinately to hot fires and violent cooking.

The coal range. — Progress is slow, and the coal range 
will not be abolished at present. Figure 18 is an example of 
a good range as easy to manage as possible. The coal box 
at (1) has a lining that prevents the iron from burning out. 
The air enters at (2) and passes out at (3), when the fire is 
first made. When it is necessary to heat the oven, a damper

is closed at (4), and the heated air then passes around the 
oven in the direction of the arrows. The coal is put in at 
(5) and the ashes shaken down at (6). Larger ranges, resting 
upon the floor, have a " dump " for the ashes directly into 
the ash box in the cellar, and some makes have a device for 
operating this with the foot. The coal stove involves the 



46 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

labor of bringing in coal and taking out ashes, and space 
must be given to the coal bin and ash pit. A range of this 
size would serve for a family of five or six. It requires from 
2 to 3 hods per day. A hood should be placed above a large 
range, whether coal or gas. 

To make a coal fire. — See that the grate is clean and that the 
ashes have been removed. You know that a current of air con- 
taining oxygen is needed to make the Are burn. How will you 
arrange the damper at (2) and (3) when you are starting the fibre? 

Coal does not begin to burn easily. Therefore we kindle it by 
materials that have a low kindling temperature, light wood, paper, 
and matches. 

In the bottom of the grate, lay twisted pieces of paper, or very 
finely split pieces of wood, or shavings, next in order larger pieces 
of wood laid " crisscross," yet close enough not to let the coal fall 
through, and on the top a shovelful or two of coal. Why do you 
not put in flat newspapers, and lay the kindling lengthwise and 
solid? Put on the stove lids, arrange the dampers properly, and 
touch the match. Why do you use the match? Why does the 
match light? Perhaps your nature study lessons will help you to 
explain this whole kindling process. 

What should be the next step in the fire making? How should 
you finally arrange the dampers ? 

A coal fire will keep well for a considerable length of time, if the 
coal is put on and the ash removed regularly, provided the stove is 
well constructed, and the coal of good quality. Add fresh coal 
before the fire becomes a dull red, and shows ashes. If it gets too 
low, wood kindling will be needed, and this is poor management. 
Be careful not to put in so much coal that you cannot put the lid 
on firmly. It ruins the top of a stove if the hot coals touch it. 

Soot must be removed once in a while from the top and bottom 
of the oven, and from the stove pipe. 

The gas stove. — Figure 19 shows a well-constructed stove 
of the usual type. Notice the air space, and asbestos lining 
around the oven. The burner for heating the oven is at (1). 
Holes in the sides allow the heated air to pass outside of the

oven at (2) and into the oven as indicated by the arrows. 
The heated current passes out of the oven at the back of the 
top, and passes out of the stove at (3), where it should be 
carried away by a pipe into a flue. The heat of the oven 
burner is also used for toasting and roasting underneath, on 




the movable rack at (4). The oven burner is lighted by a 
leader burner at (5). The top burners, five in number, are 
at (6). Below those is a removable pan at (7). The top of 
the stove is removable in sections, and the burners are easily 
removed when cleaning is necessary.

FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



The gas burner (Fig. 20) is constructed on the principle 
of the Bunsen burner, which you may have used in the labora- 
tory. There is an opening in the pipe, near the stopcock, 
which admits the air, that it may mix with the gas, and give 
the blue flame. If there is not enough air, the flame burns 
with a yellow color, and smokes. If there is too much air, 
there is a roaring sound, and the flame " pulls back " and 
burns with a smoky yellow flame, and disagreeable odor. 

There is a valve always to reg- 
ulate the air supply for each 
burner. Figure 20 shows a 
burnerremoved fromtherange. 
(1) is the hollow, star-shaped 
chamber which gives space for 
the thorough mixing of the gas 
with the air. The gas enters 
from the connecting pipe at 
(2), the air at (3), and (4) is 
the valve for regulating the 
air supply. 

Gas ranges of this type are built in different sizes, and 
with varying arrangements of ovens and hot-closets. An 
oven above the stove is convenient. Ranges are built also 
for using either gas or coal. A range of the size pictured, 
with four large burners on the top, will serve for a family of 
five or six, if the work is well planned. The oven burner 
consumes 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the top burners 
2 cubic feet each, and the simmering burner somewhat 
less. This is estimated for a burner turned on full.

To manage a gas stove. — Before lighting the top or oven burners 
see that the stopcocks are all tight, with no escaping gas. To 
light the top burners, strike the match, turn on the stopcock, and 
touch the match to the gas when it is flowing well. A disagreeable 



FUEL AND STOVES 49 

" popping " follows if the match is applied to the burner before 
the gas flows. For lighting the oven, a " leader " burner at the 
side of the stove acts as a taper. Open the oven doors, and the 
door below, strike the match, turn on the leader, and light it, turn 
on the back burner, and then the front burner, and turn out the 
leader. The so-called explosion of a gas stove is due to the sudden 
lighting of a quantity of gas under the oven that has collected with- 
out being lighted. 

The important point in managing a gas stove is to keep the stop- 
cock turned so that the flame is low. The full flame is needed only 
when water is being brought to the boiling point, and for the first 
heating of the oven. The low flame should be protected from 
draft. Many gas stoves now have a small simmering burner 
that is more useful than the large burner. Another point in the 
use of the stove is the prevention of the " boiling over " from some 
kettle. The low flame helps here, and it is also necessary that the . 
kettles should not be too full. " Boiling over " clogs the burners, 
and makes necessary the frequent cleaning of the pan underneath 
the burners. 

The oven burner should be lighted from five to ten minutes be- 
fore the oven is wanted, depending upon the intensity of the flames. 
After the food has been put in the oven, allow a few minutes, not 
more than five, for the food to heat through, and then turn the 
flame as low as possible. Often, one burner can be turned out. 
This you have to learn by experience. When toasting or broiling 
is the process, light the oven burner before using, because the work 
is performed by the heated iron as well as by the gas flame. Leave 
the lower door open, as bread toasts or meat broils, to hasten the 
browning process, for it is the oxygen of the air that causes the 
browning. Some coal ovens have a damper for admitting air for 
this same purpose and though some flavor is lost in this way by 
evaporation, the amount is negligible in a quick cooking process. 
The Atkinson oven is so tightly closed, that food does not acquire 
a rich brown in it. An opening at the top is available when a deli- 
cate brown is wanted. It is true, however, that the slow process 
with a minimum of evaporation gives a flavor that compensates for 
the brown color and flavor. All burners should be removed if 
the holes seem clogged and be boiled out in a solution of washing 
soda, two tablespoonfuls to a gallon of water. Do not blacken the 
burners. 



50 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Kerosene stoves. — The best type is a blue-flame stove 
with a wick. Kerosene stoves are made with no wick, the 
kerosene being vaporized just before it reaches the burner, 
but such a stove requires occasional pumping to force the 
kerosene into the vaporizing chamber, and on the whole is 
less satisfactory than the stove with the wick. The heat is 
intense from this blue flame, and the burner is economical of 
the fuel. The small kerosene stoves, burning with a yellow 
flame are always inclined to smoke, and difficult to keep 
clean. A three- or four-burner oil stove with a portable oven 
will do the cooking in summer for a family of five or six. 
One burner consumes a gallon of oil in 15 hours. Portable 
double ovens are furnished with such stoves. 

The kerosene stove is cheaper to operate than a gas range, 
even with kerosene at fourteen cents a gallon, but the heat 
is not under such perfect control, and the stove requires more 
work to keep it clean. 

The one important point in the management of this blue-flame 
wick stove is to keep the flame down by having the wick low, and 
where it belongs. The cylinder around the burner prevents the 
escape of heat and carries it to the utensil above. A careless 
person, by raising the wick too high, and producing a yellow smoky 
flame, makes much trouble for herself. It is important to fill the 
tank without spilling a drop of kerosene, and to keep every part 
of the stove well washed off with soap and water. The wick should 
be rubbed off occasionally, never cut, and if an odor becomes per- 
ceptible, the burner should be taken apart and boiled in a solution 
of washing soda and water. The wick will need to be renewed at 
intervals, depending upon the amount of use that it has. With 
care a stove of this kind is clean and odorless. 

Electric apparatus. — Figure 21 shows a table arranged 
for cooking by electricity, each piece of apparatus having its 
own connection. Compare this with the frontispiece, the 
method of cooking in the eighteenth century, and you will

realize how far' we have progressed in the way of convenience, 
comfort, and heat economy. Figure 22 shows a disk stove 
four and a half inches in diameter, upon which a saucepan

may stand, and which is therefore available for more than 
one purpose. 

The advantages of electric cooking are obvious. The heat 
is directly conducted to each utensil, and a minimum amount 
is lost in radiation. The degree of heat is perfectly under 
control, and the manipulation is nothing more than the 
turning of a knob. When the apparatus is installed, it is 
adjusted to the voltage, so that no further regulation is 



52 



FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



necessary. There are no waste products, and no matches to 
light or throw away. If the wiring is properly done, there is 
no danger from fire. The one present disadvantage is the 
cost. Each piece of apparatus is expensive. The cost of 
running must depend upon the cost of electricity in the neigh- 
borhood, and the number of watts per hour used by each 
piece of apparatus. The larger the utensil, the more watts 
consumed. The disk stove in Fig. 22 uses 250 watts ; a disk 

of 6 inches diame- 
ter, 475 watts; of 
8 inches, 650 watts. 
Some pieces of ap- 
paratus are ar- 
ranged for three 
different heats, 
with a different 
number of watts 
for each heat. With 
3 heats are possible,

Oven thermometers. — A thermometer is furnished set 
in the door of many ranges. While these are guides after 
one has learned to use the oven, they are not really accurate 
by scale. For exact work in testing oven temperature, a 
hole must be bored in the side of the oven, and a chemical 
thermometer inserted, protected by asbestos and metal. 

Simple tests for oven temperature will be found in Chapter 
XI.

CHAPTER IV 

FOOD PREPARATION, THE PRINCIPLES AND 
TECHNIQUE 

The principles of cooking. — In science the word " prin- 
ciple " ordinarily means a formulation of some general or 
constant mode of behavior — a generalization based on many 
observations of fact. In cookery the word is used in the 
same sense ; for example, one may say that an important 
principle to bear in mind when cooking with any fat is that 
the fats may be melted without decomposition, but when too 
strongly heated they begin to decompose with the production 
of acrid and irritating products. Sometimes, however, we 
speak of " principles of cookery " in a broader and some- 
what less exact sense to indicate the general purposes of 
cooking operations, as when we say that the most important 
principle of vegetable cookery is to soften the fiber without 
destroying the flavor or dissolving away the ash constituents 
of the vegetable. 

That is, the change either chemical or physical that takes 
place in a certain foodstuff by the application of heat or 
cold or by the use of a fermentation process may be referred 
to as the underlying, working principle. We shall study in 
detail these changes as we experiment with and prepare each 
food material, but a general statement of the effect of heat 
on various foodstuffs will be helpful here. 

Protein. — There are several forms of protein, with dif- 
ferences that we can understand only after a thorough study 
of chemistry. The most important proteins in meat, fish, 

64 



FOOD PREPARATION 55 

eggs, milk, old beans and peas coagulate, or become slightly 
harder or firmer at a temperature below the boiling point of 
water. We shall perform an experiment to show this while 
studying the egg. There is no marked chemical change; 
that is, the protein is not changed to another substance. 

Fats. — Solid fats are liquefied by heat, and freed from the 
tissue that contains them in animal fats like suet. 

When a fat begins to smoke with heat, a chemical change is 
taking place. If intense heat is continued, all the hydrogen 
and oxygen are driven off and pure carbon remains. When 
the fat is " brown," giving the flavor we like, a part of the 
oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off. The " boiling " 
of fat in a kettle is ordinarily due to the boiling of the water 
contained in the fat. 

Starch. — Starch occurs in the form of granules. See 
Fig. 39. In boiling water, the granule expands and finally 
bursts, and frees the content, the pure starch, and the whole 
mass thickens. 

Boiled with an acid the starch is changed to dextrin, a sub- 
stance resembling a gum, and the mixture becomes thin; 
and this process continued changes the dextrin to dextrose. 

With intense " dry " heat, as in toasting, the granule 
expands and opens, and the contents change to dextrin. 
Continued heat reduces the starch to pure carbon. The 
brown color and pleasant flavor in toast are a stage on the 
road to carbon. 

Sugar. — Sugar first melts with heat, then begins to de- 
compose, giving off water. This is also a stage on the road 
to pure carbon. Caramel, a familiar flavor, is sugar in the 
brown stage, with the water partly driven off. 

The art in applying intense heat to fat, starch, and sugar 
is to know the stopping point, — to reach the " brown taste " 
and stop short of the " burnt taste." 



56 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Mineral matter. — The " ash " remains for the most part 
unchanged by heat, but may be lost in the water in which- 
vegetables and meat are cooked if the water is thrown 
away. 

Vegetable fiber is softened by heat and moisture, and the 
protein, starch, fat, and sugar are freed, making them avail- 
able for our digestion and nutrition. 

Meat fiber softens at a low temperature, that is, below the 
boiling point of water, with moisture; continued intense 
heat shrinks and hardens it. A tender steak fried with fat 
in a hot pan will soon resemble sole leather. 

The technique of food preparation. — From the moment 
the food materials enter the kitchen until the unusable 
portions are destroyed or carried away, there is a best way 
of working with them at each step, and the sum of these may 
be said to make a good technique. This technique will 
include cleanliness first and foremost, then skill in the use of 
tools, judgment in managing cooking apparatus and in ap- 
plying heat in cooking processes, and accuracy and rapidity 
of execution. It will also include or add to itself the aesthetic 
element, the fine art of flavoring, the dainty garnishing of a 
dish. Moreover, this technique is the method of putting 
into practice some basic, scientific principle. To illustrate : 

The principle that underlies toast-making is threefold, — 

Heat evaporates moisture throughout the slice of bread. 

Intense heat changes the content of the starch granules on the 
surface of the slice of bread to dextrin. 

Intense heat, long continued, will change first the surface starch, 
and then all, to carbon (charcoal). 

A good technique will secure the first two, and avoid the third and 
includes, — 

The selection of bread already partially dry. 

The cutting of bread into slices of uniform thickness. 

Regulating the source of heat. 



FOOD PREPARATION 57 

Placing the slices firmly in a toaster, or on a fork, or evenly on a 
rack when toasting by gas. 

Keeping the toast at a distance from the source of heat that in- 
sures a steady but not too rapid change. 

Turning the toaster or the slices to cook each surface in turn 
and thus to make the process slower. 

Stopping the process before carbon is formed and the toast 
"burned." (A good technique doesnot include scraping the toast!) 

The (Esthetic element in toast-making might be a pretty shape 
of the shoes, say triangular pieces, and a dainty arrangement. In 
this case and in others it is true that the result of a good technique 
is aesthetic, in that correct manipulation while securing the desired 
chemical change also develops the pleasing golden brown that 
makes the toast so attractive. 

The care of food materials. — When food materials are 
delivered, have receptacles ready for each kind of food. (See 
kitchen furnishing.) Attend first to perishable foods. 
Wash and dry milk and cream bottles before putting them in 
the refrigerator. Treat eggs in the same way. This is also 
a good plan with lemons and other skin fruit, unless the 
quantity is too large, in which case they should not be put 
into the refrigerator. Remove wrappings from meat, 
poultry, and fish ; wipe them with a soft cloth, dipped in 
salt and water, dry them, and place them in the ice box. 
Wash the cloth thoroughly and dry it. Fish should be 
covered that its odor may not affect other food. Vegetables 
like lettuce, celery, and spinach should be washed and 
picked over immediately, and the poor portions thrown away. 
All semi-perishable foods should be put in a cool, dry place, 
and the non-perishables in their separate receptacles. (See 
page 20.) Do not keep anything in brown paper bags, but 
save these bags for other uses. 

Have a regular time for inspecting and for cleaning all the 
places and receptacles where food is kept. Do not allow any 
spilled food material to remain anywhere, and do not tolerate 



58 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the presence of any material, cooked or uncooked, that shows 
the least taint. A keen sense of smell is a good servant here. 

The processes of food preparation. — With kitchen in 
order, tools ready, and food materials at hand, we are ready 
for the actual food preparation. A distinction is to be 
made between cookery and cooking. Cookery includes 
all the steps necessary to produce the finished product, 
while cooking is the actual application of heat, only one 
step of the whole process, though, indeed, one of the most 
important and difficult. The order of procedure in food 
preparation is as follows : 

See first that the stove is ready (Chapter IV). Then 
comes the choice and study of the recipe or the method of 
cooking. The word " recipe " is from a Latin word meaning 
" take." Follow this advice and "take " or bring together 
on the work table whatever materials are needed. Decide 
upon the necessary utensils, and place them conveniently 
near. As you gather the materials together you will measure 
and weigh the exact amounts. Do this before you begin 
the putting together or mixing. Sometimes instead of mixing, 
the necessary process is paring, or scraping, or cutting, each 
with its own best way. Then follows the application of 
heat. Some foods are then served at once, others must be 
carefully put away after cooling. Or again, there is no ap- 
plication of heat, for instance, when the freezing temperature 
is used in ice cream ; or in a salad, or fruit preparation where 
cooling in the refrigerator is the next step. The technique 
of preparing a meal and serving will be found in Chapter XVI. 

How to study a recipe. — Remember that a recipe is a 
bit of experience handed down for us to make useful. Some 
one experimented at some time long ago, perhaps failed at 
first, tried again, finally succeeded, and passed on the result 
by word of mouth to others. There were doubtless good 



FOOD PREPARATION 59 

cooks long before there were printed or written recipes. Some 
recipes, however, have been handed down from Roman times, 
and recipes were printed as early as the sixteenth century. 
Modern recipes are much more accurate than the old, as 
you may see if you have opportunity to read some old cook 
book. 

At first in using a recipe follow its directions exactly. 
Notice the proportions, and read carefully the directions for 
combining the ingredients, noting those points that are 
most important. Have the whole process well in mind before 
you begin work. Do not let it be necessary to refer to the 
printed page at every move you make. This is poor 
technique. 

When the use of a recipe is preceded by some simple ex- 
periment that makes the basic principle clear, it is much 
easier to use the recipe with intelligence. 

When you are no longer a novice you may take liberties 
with a recipe, even a new one, scanning it with a critical eye, 
and perhaps giving it a cool welcome. It may not be new 
at all ! For this is the secret of recipes, — there are really 
only a few, and the key to their use is the recognition of the 
old in the new garb, and the having of a few type recipes 
clearly in mind. Each kind of prepared dish has one f or 
two, or three basic forms or mixtures. Learn these, and then 
with experience you will become inventive, and make your 
own variations. For example, there are but two kinds of 
cake, — those made with butter (or other fat) and those 
without butter (the sponge cake). You will not attempt to 
memorize many recipes, but you will find that in studying 
these type recipes you have learned a few proportions so well 
that you cannot forget them. When you have reached this 
stage of freedom you will still do exact work, but your in- 
genuity and taste wil T have free play and you will not be 



60 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tied to other people's recipes. But you cannot well begin 
at this end. 

Make some plan for recording new recipes that you test 
and find good. It may be a printed recipe, or one that a 
friend gives you. The most convenient plan is a recipe box 
or card file. The guide cards are arranged alphabetically, 
and each recipe is either pasted upon a card or written 
upon it. This plan makes it easy to discard an old recipe, 
or one that has proved unsatisfactory, and to keep new 
recipes in alphabetical order, which cannot be done in a book. 
A loose leaf book is made for recipes, alphabetized at the side, 
with envelopes for holding cuttings that may be fastened in 
between the pages. This is a little less easy to use than 
the card file. 

Weighing and measuring. — The system is "Avoir- 
dupois," sixteen ounces to the pound. Learn to read the 
scales exactly, and when weighing, always allow for the 
weight of the utensil or paper holding the food. Weighing 
is more accurate than measuring, but it is slower, and the 
measuring can be made sufficiently accurate for most daily 
work. Weighing is necessary in the cookery of large pieces 
of meat and with poultry in order to estimate correctly the 
time for cooking; and it is more convenient to weigh than 
measure when preserving fruit if the quantities are large. 
Also in studying food values it is usually necessary to weigh 
the articles of food. 

The measures in common use are the saltspoon, teaspoon, and 
tablespoon, the half-pint measuring cup, the pint, quart, and 
gallon of liquid measure. The saltspoon is not accurate, and 
it is better to use some fraction of a teaspoonful. Teaspoons 
and tablespoons of a standard volume may be found at some fur- 
nishing shops. The spoons in common use vary in size, and the 
only way to approximate accuracy is to use the level spoonful. 



FOOD PREPARATION 61 

This is now the common practice. Tin and glass half-pint 
cups are made gauged in quarters and thirds. Those 
commonly on sale sometimes measure more than one fourth 
of the standard quart. Inquire when you buy if the cup 
measure is standard, — that is, exactly one half standard 
pint. A quart measure, with four divisions, is necessary 
for careful work. A pint measure is convenient, but not 
necessary if you have the quart and half -pint measuring cup. 
It is necessary to know the relation of these different 
weights and measures to each other. While you may find 
tables of relative weight and measures in many cookbooks, 
it is much better for you to work out a few of the most useful 
for yourself, making careful record in your notebooks. 

The following abbreviations are short cuts in reading and 
writing. 

oz. = ounce 

lb. = pound 

ssp. = saltspoonful 

tsp. = teaspoonful 

tbsp. = tablespoonful

Experiments in weighing and measuring. 1 

Answer these questions by performing the experiments. Record 
in notebook in orderly form. 



1 Teacheb's Note. — These experiments may be performed as each food 
material is used. In this ease a page should be kept in the notebook for 
the table of weights and measures, and each observation recorded as it is 
made. It may be that the perishable articles will not be on hand, except 
as they are used in order. The weighing and measuring should be dwelt 
on all through the course. 



62 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Apparatus. Standard scales, a quart measure, and for each pu- 
pil a measuring cup, table knife, teaspoon, and tablespoon. 
Materials. Those mentioned below. 

1. How many eggs (medium size) to 1 lb.? 

2. What is the weight of one egg ? 

3. Of one pint of flour? 

4. Of one cup of flour ? 

5. Of one cup of granulated sugar? 

6. Of one cup of powdered sugar ? 

7. Of one pint of milk? 

8. Average the weight of six potatoes. 

9. How many level teaspoonf uls of flour to a level tablespoonful ? 

10. How many teaspoonfuls of water to a tablespoonful ? 

11. How many tablespoonfuls of flour to a cup? 

12. How many tablespoonfuls of water to a cup ? 

(These relative measures are convenient for dividing recipes.) 

13. Measure a level tablespoonful of flour, by filling the spoon, 
holding it level, and leveling the flour by running the back of the 
knife quickly from the base of the bowl of the spoon to the tip. 

How can you most accurately divide this in halves ? In quar- 
ters? 

14. How much does a cup of flaked cereal weigh? 

15. How much does a cup of granular cereal weigh? 

16. Butter is hard to measure in a cup. If a recipe calls for- \ 
cup butter, it is easier to measure it by tablespoonfuls. Find out 
how many make { cup. 

17. How much does a cup of butter weigh? If you know this, 
you can weigh it, instead of measuring, or if your butter is in pound 
" pats," you will be able to cut off a cupful, instead of weighing it. 

18. An old-fashioned recipe for sponge cake reads thus : Take 
the weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour. Trans- 
late this into measures. 

Preparing and mixing. — Food materials that are not to 
be mixed with others still need special preparation before 
heat is applied. 

For fruits and vegetables, washing is the first stage, followed by 
scraping, paring, peeling, cutting, or slicing. Meats, poultry, and 



FOOD PREPARATION 63 

fish must be cleaned by wiping, and cut and trimmed with a sharp 
knife. 

Cooked meats and fish and vegetables may be chopped or sliced. 

Cooked vegetables are also mashed and beaten. 

Cream is whipped or beaten, and eggs served raw likewise. 

These seem simple processes, but each one needs a good tool and 
a knack in the muscles. Each method will be taken up m detail, 
with each food material. 

Methods of mixing are important, where several ingredients 
are combined. We seek for a way that will give the most 
complete mingling of all the substances with smoothness 
and lightness, at the same time saving time and strength. 
We must look always for the "short cut." It is necessary 
to have the texture of the food such that it can be well 
masticated and mixed with the digestive fluids, but time is 
too precious to spend hours on a dessert, or in beating 
biscuits. 

Sifting, or putting materials through a fine mesh, is used to lighten 
flour that has been packed down, to remove coarse portions, or to 
mix thoroughly several dry ingredients. 

Stirring is done with a spoon, and is a round and round motion, 
used for mixing a liquid and a dry ingredient. 

Rubbing is used for combining a dry ingredient with a semi-solid 
substance hke butter. Creaming is a term used for the rubbing of 
butter until it becomes soft and creamy. A spoon should be used, 
not the hand. 

" Cutting in " with a knife is used for combining butter with 
flour in biscuit and pastry where the butter should not be softened. 

Beating with a spoon, or beater of the spoon type, is a free over 
and over motion, the spoon being lifted from the mixture for the 
backward stroke. This is used for increasing the smoothness of 
the mixture after the first stirring, and for beating in air. It needs 
a strong free motion of the forearm. Beating is also accomplished 
by the rotary motion of a mechanical beater like the Dover. 

Cutting and folding is the delicate process of mixing lightly beaten 
egg with a liquid or semi-liquid without losing out the air. The 



64 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

spoon is cut in, side-wise, a rotary motion carries it down and up 
again, and it folds in the beaten egg as it goes. 

Kneading is a motion used with dough, and is a combination of 
a rocking and pressing motion, accomplished by the hands. A 
good result can be obtained by some bread machines, and this is the 
cleaner method. 

Rolling out is just what the term denotes, a rolling of a thick piece 
of dough by means of a cylindrical wooden " pin " to the thickness 
proper for cookies and crusts. Dry bread is also rolled to break 
it into fine crumbs. 

Pounding and grinding are usually accomplished for us now in 
factories in breaking of spices and coffee. It is better to have a 
coffee mill at home. 

The order of mixing is important in its effect in batters and doughs 
and is discussed in that chapter. 

Cooking processes. — For the beginnings of cooking we 
should need to go back to the days when game was roasted 
by the open fire, built for warmth, or corn parched on hot 
stones. Perhaps some root was cooked in the hot ashes. 
This primitive method of roasting we still use in camp fires, 
and in modified form wherever food is directly exposed to 
the heat of coal or gas. Water could not be a cooking 
medium until man advanced at least to the first stage of 
pottery making, when some rude basket daubed with clay 
was water-tight and sufficiently heat proof. 

Application of heat is the most difficult stage of the whole 
process of cookery. It is so easy to have the heat too intense, 
or too low, to expose the food for too long or too short a time 
to its action. Most of our apparatus fails to give us a uni- 
form heat, the tendency being to an increase or decrease 
of temperature. Since the boiling temperature of water re- 
mains at 212° F., boiling is an easy process to manage, pro- 
vided the water does not boil out. The presence of water 
insures a low or moderate temperature always. 

It requires patience and time to learn how to bring this 



FOOD PREPARATION 65 

natural force of heat under control. One novice who had 
allowed a flour paste to boil over and burn while she was 
looking out of the window remarked : " We may forget, 
but they never do ! " — a pretty way of stating the steady 
working of nature's forces which we can harness for our use 
only by the exercise of reason and will and constant watch- 
fulness. The unintelligent cook is impatient of slow pro- 
cesses, and cannot believe that food will finally be " done " 
unless the water is at a " galloping " boil, and a red-hot fire 
is keeping the oven at burning temperature. 

Look upon the application of heat as a continuation of 
nature's slow ripening process, a softening of tough fibers 
and a development of pleasing flavors. For why do we cook 
at all except for these reasons ? Primitive man thought only 
that the food had a better taste. He may have decided, too, 
that it was easier to masticate; but we have learned that 
in some cases we may, with right methods of cooking, make it 
easier to digest farther on in the alimentary canal. Modern 
science carries us a step farther and teaches us that cooking 
destroys lower organisms, such as harmful bacteria that may 
be present, and even animal parasites in meats. 

We cook, therefore, to improve the appearance of food, to 
develop flavors, to render some foodstuffs more digestible and to 
destroy microorganisms. f 

We have at our command the following processes : 
Heat direct from coal, charcoal, wood, or gas. 

Toasting. — Surfaces of food exposed and turned for browning. 

Broiling. — Thin portions of meat or fish exposed and turned for 
searing, browning, and short cooking of the interior. 

Roasting. — Thicker cuts of meat exposed and turned frequently 
for searing, browning, and gradual cooking of the interior. This 
is an ancient method. It survives in the French " R6tisserie " ; 
and we use it in the modern gas stove when we cook directly under 
the gas.

Heat through an intervening medium. 

Water, the medium. 

Boiling. — Cooking in boiling water, temperature, 212° F., or 
100° c. 

Simmering, stewing, or "coddling." — Cooking in water below 
the boiling temperature, 180° F. up to 210° F. 

Steaming. — Cooking in a receptacle into which steam pene- 
trates, 212° F. — or in a closed receptacle surrounded by steam or 
boiling water as in a double boiler, or a " steamer," temperature 
from 200° F. to 210° F. 
Fat, the medium. 

Deep fat frying, temperature 350°-400° F. 
Heated surfaces, the medium. 

Pan broiling — Cooking of chops or steaks in a heated pan, with- 
out additional fat. 

Saute. — To cook in a heated pan with a small amount of fat, 
enough merely to prevent the food from sticking to the pan and to 
hasten the browning process. " Baking " cakes on a griddle is a 
modification of this method. 

Baking. — Cooking in a heated oven, temperature from 300° F. to 
450° F., or higher for rapid browning. Meat and poultry cooked 
in an oven are baked and not roasted, although we use the word 
" roast " for this method. 

Braising. — Cooking meat in a heated oven in a closed vessel, 
with a supply of water to keep down the temperature. This might 
be called an " oven stew." 

These methods are sometimes combined in one process. In 
a brown stew, the meat is first cooked in a pan with a little fat to 
brown it, and to sear the outside for retaining the juices, before the 
actual stewing begins. A " pot-roast," is an old-fashioned method 
of cooking a solid piece of meat with a little water in a pot on top 
of the stove. The water simmers, out, and the meat is browned. 
What methods does this process unite ? 

The American Indians in their Squantum, or Clam Bake, heated 
a layer of stones by means of a fire on top, removing the ashes 
when the fire died down. A layer of wet seaweed was placed on the 
stones, and upon this clams, fish, and corn were laid, and covered 
with another layer of seaweed. We have inherited this method from 
the Indians, and use it at the shore. What is the cooking process ? 



FOOD PREPARATION 67 

Care of food after cooking. — Bread, cake, cookies, and 
pastry should be cooled on a rack, or spread out in such a 
way that they do not steam. They should then be placed 
in a tin box or stone jar, which has been cleaned by washing 
and scalding with boiling water, and thoroughly dried. 
This process destroys any mold that might be lurking about. 
Keep paraffin paper on hand to cover this class of food in 
its box or jar. This will prevent too rapid drying out. Do 
not use cloth. It flavors the bread or cake, no matter how 
clean it may be. 

All food that is to be served cold or reheated should be 
cooled before placing in the ice box. For what reason? 
Cool by placing in a draught, or set the vessel containing 
the food in running cold water from the faucet. It is par- 
ticularly important to cool soups and broths rapidly. Which 
of these methods will you use, as being the more rapid ? 

All meat that is to be served cold should be cooled, es- 
pecially if it is rare, or underdone. How will you accomplish 
this? 

Care of left overs. — This is one of the tests of food manage- 
ment. It is so easy at the end of a meal either to throw 
food away, or set it into the refrigerator on the dish in which 
it has been served. Have a good supply of cheap bowls, 
plates, and saucers to hold left overs in the refrigerator, thus 
avoiding one possibility for breakage of the table china. 

Keep slices of bread for toasting, pieces of bread, to dry for crumbs, 
with special receptacles for each. Return pieces of cake to the cake 
box. Muffins may be reheated. Toast may be kept to serve under 
eggs or meat. 

All butter should be saved. Pieces left on butter plates if clean 
should be scraped into a wide-mouthed jar and kept for cooking. 

Pieces of meat should be kept for reheating or " made " dishes, 
stews or soups or for salads. In hot weather, let your first order 
of meat be small, and dispose of left overs as rapidly as possible. 



68 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Vegetables may be reheated, or used for flavoring soups and stews, 
or used cold in salads. 

Desserts and fruits may be used for a " pick up " luncheon. 

Salads do not keep their freshness and flavor well, and should 
be used very soon. 

Milk and cream should be returned to proper receptacles in the 
refrigerator as soon as possible. 

Disposal of waste food. — This is the final test of good 
housekeeping, and many otherwise good housekeepers fail 
just here. Even at its best the garbage pail is not altogether 
a pleasing object, and at its worst it is unspeakable. It 
must not be ignored. 

Have a system adapted to your own kitchen, and the 
municipal method of disposal, if there is such. 

Use a covered pail of enamel ware, rather than one of galvanized 
iron. The surface of the enamel is smooth, and therefore easier 
to wash, and there is no excuse for putting off the cleansing of the 
pail. Wash, rinse, and dry the pail and the cover immediately after it 
is emptied. Do not put a piece of paper in the bottom of the pail. 
This request is made by the department in New York City, and it is 
always better not to mix food waste and paper waste. If you live in 
an apartment house, your name should be painted on the pail. 

Never put liquid into the garbage pail with solid refuse. Strain 
out whatever liquid may be left in coffee or tea, and pour it into the 
sink drain. If there is a greasy liquid to throw away, add to it a 
teaspoonful or more of washing powder, and let it stand a time. If 
you have used enough of the powder, you will find that you have a 
soapy liquid to pour down the sink. 

Coffee, tea, cocoa, or lemonade left in cups should be diluted 
and poured down the sink and never into the garbage pail. 

Empty garbage at evening when possible, to prevent the long 
standing through the night. Keep the pail closely covered both 
day and night, to keep out flies, and water bugs, if they are about. 
Allow the pail to stand outside the kitchen unless the fire escape is 
the only accessible out-of-doors. Remember that the fire escape 
is not a back porch, and that you would be fined for using it as such 
if the inspectors were efficient. 



FOOD PREPARATION 69 

There are two classes of waste : uncooked refuse, like 
potato skins, egg shells, pea pods, meat trimmings and 
bones ; and table scraps from plates. 

Pieces of fat may be " tried out," but do not accumulate more 
than you use. A few egg shells may be kept for settling coffee, 
but again do not keep too many. 

The country dweller has a simple problem. What the farm ani- 
mals do not eat will serve as fertilizer for plant life. After the bones 
have been picked, keep them together, in some receptacle, and 
finally bury or burn them. Have a compost heap properly covered 
where the uneaten fragments will decompose and make fertilizer, 
or bury them at once if preferred. 

The city dweller who uses a coal stove is able to burn some refuse. 
Strain out whatever liquid is present, dry the refuse under the 
grate, and put it into a hot fire. Do not crowd damp refuse into 
the fire box when the fire is low, for it will smoulder, and this heavy 
smoke will eventually clog the flues. The odor of this smoke, too, 
is disagreeable in the neighborhood. A garbage drier, set into the 
stove pipe, has been devised, but the simpler plan of drying the refuse 
under the grate is quite as satisfactory. 

Where gas or kerosene is the fuel, or where electricity is used, the 
garbage pail is the only resort, unless one lives in a building equipped 
with a special stove or " garbage burner " for the disposal of waste.

CHAPTER V 
WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 

Although water does not supply energy to the body, it 
plays an important part in nutrition. As building material, 
it constitutes about two thirds of the body weight, and as a 
regulator of body processes it serves as a solvent and carrier 
of nutritive material and waste, keeps the blood and digestive 
fluids of proper concentration, and helps to regulate the 
temperature of the body. It is contained in nearly all food 
materials and is the basis of all beverages. 

Water as a beverage. — Water is being given off all the 
time from the body through the lungs, skin, and kidneys. 
The exact amount depends partly upon atmospheric con- 
ditions and the amount of exercise, which affect the loss 
through the lungs and skin, and partly on the amount taken 
in, for water passes through the body rather quickly. We 
can endure lack of food for weeks, but can exist only a few 
days without water. 

A drink of water taken the first thing in the morning tends 
to clean out the digestive tract and put one in good condition 
for breakfast. Water with meals aids digestion, provided 
it is not used to wash down food but is taken when the 
mouth is empty. It should not be extremely cold nor hot. 
Two glasses at a single meal are usually all that are desirable. 
When there is much water in the food, as in soups, milk, 
fruits, and some vegetables, or when other beverages are 
taken, less will be taken as plain water. When one feels 

70 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 71 

hungry and uncomfortable between meals a drink of water 
will often relieve the sensation. 

Water is either soft or hard. Rain water is perfectly soft, 
but as it passes through the earth after falling, it sometimes 
becomes laden with mineral substances, that affect its cleans- 
ing properties, and that may affect its physiological action. 
Such water is called hard. 

Temporary hardness is caused by a soluble lime compound 
which is precipitated by boiling. If the teakettle is in- 
crusted inside by a layer of lime, the hardness is of this 
character. Such water should be boiled and cooled for 
drinking. Permanent hardness is due to other compounds of 
lime and magnesia which are not precipitated by boiling, 
but which can be counteracted for cleansing purposes by the 
addition of some substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. 
If the excess of salts has some undesirable physiological 
effect, this water should be distilled, or bottled water for 
drinking brought from elsewhere. 

Of much greater importance is the question of the freedom 
of the water supply from harmful bacteria and organic matter. 
Never use a well without having the water tested by an 
expert. This will sometimes be done by the local or state 
Board of Health or Experiment Station. All water sources 
should be guarded from contamination. (See " Shelter and 
Clothing," Chapter V.) Filters may be used, and are effective 
in straining out sediment, but the home filter is seldom to be 
relied upon to remove actual bacterial contamination. If used 
at all, the filter should be frequently cleaned and sterilized in 
boiling water. In case the supply is suspected, the water for 
drinking should be boiled for at least ten minutes, allowed to 
settle, if necessary, and poured off into bottles for cooling. This 
is a practice to be commended after a heavy rainfall, and espe- 
cially in the autumn. These bottles may be placed on the ice. 



72 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Ice must be used with caution always in drinking water, 
and it is the safer way to cool the water beside the ice. The 
freezing of water in pond and river does not purify or sterilize 
it. Natural ice is usually questionable. Artificial ice, if 
properly manufactured, is much safer. 

Always have a supply of water in covered pitcher or water 
bottle, with clean glasses at hand, where it may be taken 
freely when wanted. Remember that the individual cup or 
glass is an absolute necessity. The dipper or glass in common 
must not be countenanced. In a large family of many chil- 
dren it would save labor to use paper cups between meals. 

Water should be swallowed slowly, and ice-cold water 
should not be taken when one is overheated. When one is 
overthirsty, control must be exercised in regard to quantity 
and rapidity of drinking. 

Water in cooking. — Water is necessary to the softening 
of fiber, and the cooking of starch. It acts as a solvent for 
sugar and salt and for gelatin, and is the basis of meat soups, 
certain substances in the meat dissolving in the water. The 
flavors of tea and coffee are extracted by water. 

As a medium in cooking it supplies heat in the steaming, 
boiling, and stewing processes, and in the form of melting ice 
with salt it acts as a freezing medium. 

It is not necessary to lift the cover of a kettle to see if the 
water boils, if one is familiar with the action of water nearing 
and at the boiling point. A simple experiment with the 
boiling of water in a Florence flask is always interesting, and 
from it one gains practical knowledge. 

Experiments with the boiling temperature of water. 

A. Apparatus: A ring stand, a Florence flask, a square of wire 

net, a chemical thermometer, a Bunsen. burner. 
Method: Place the Florence flask, half full of water, on the 

square of wire net upon the large ring of the ring stand 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 73 

over the Bunsen burner. Put the chemical thermometer 
in the Florence flask, clamping it in such a way that the 
bulb is covered by the water and yet does not touch the 
bottom of the flask. 
Make record in the notebook as follows : 

(1) The temperature when the first small bubbles appear on 

the side of the flask. 

(2) Temperature when the first large bubbles appear on the 

bottom. 

(3) Temperature when many bubbles rise rapidly to the top. 

(4) Point at which temperature ceases to rise. 

(5) Temperature when vapor first appears at the mouth of the 

flask. 

(6) What differences are apparent in the amount and motion 

of the vapor before and after boiling? 

(7) Lift the thermometer above the water and note the tem- 

perature just above the surface, when the water is 

rapidly boiling. 
The small bubbles are bubbles of air. The large are bubbles of 
steam. A complete study of the boiling process should be made in 
the Physics class. The boiling point is the point at which water 
becomes steam, and also the point at which steam condenses again 
to water. The temperature of boiling water and steam are the 
same. Under pressure steam may be heated to a higher tempera- 
ture. 

B. Boil water in a small saucepan closely covered. 

(1) Note the sounds of the water just before boiling, and the 

change in sound as the boiling begins. 

(2) Note the difference between the vapor escaping, before 

boiling, and after. This experiment is best performed 
in a teakettle. 

C. Test the temperature of the inner part of the double boiler, 

when the water boils rapidly below. To be exact, a 
hole should be bored in the cover of the boiler, a cork with 
a hole inserted, the thermometer run through the cork. 
An approximate result is obtained by putting in the 
thermometer, setting on the cover tilted, and covering 
the opening with a cloth. 

D. Stir salt into rapidly boiling water in the lower part of the 



74 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

double boiler until no more salt will dissolve (a saturated 
solution). Test the temperature. 
E. Put the inner part of the double boiler containing water into 
this boiling solution of saturated salt, being sure that 
the inner part is sufficiently deep in the salt solution. 
Note the temperature of the water in the inner boiler 
when it becomes heated. 

Boiling at high altitudes. — When the air pressure upon 
the surface of the water is lessened, the water boils at a lower 
temperature. As the altitude increases, the air pressure 
decreases, as many a mountain traveler knows to his cost. 
The boiling temperature of water is so much lowered that 
the dwellers in high regions of several thousand feet find 
it difficult to cook starchy vegetables well. A heavy iron 
pot is made with clamps for fastening down a tight cover, 
which increases the temperature somewhat. Experiments D 
and E indicate a method that can be used to a small extent. 
The baking process should be largely used, and boiling 
avoided. For meat, eggs, and fish the lower temperature is 
not undesirable. (See the chapters relating to these foods.) 

The uses of ice. — Water freezes and ice melts at the 
same point, 32° F., or 0° C. If ice is mixed with salt, the 
temperature is reduced far below the freezing point, nearly 
to 0° F. This process reduces any watery substance which it 
surrounds to its freezing point, the heat being used in the 
melting of the ice. This is an interesting topic to discuss 
in the Physics class. 

Ice at its ordinary temperature of 32° F. is used for cooling 
food agreeably. Its most important function in the refrigerar 
tor is as preserver of food for a short time at least. For 
this it is invaluable, and cheap ice is really necessary in 
summer to the health of a great xity. 

Ice substitutes. — Where the supply fails or the price is 
exorbitant, one property of water makes it a partial aid. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 75 

The rapid evaporation of water will absorb heat so rapidly 
as to reduce the temperature of adjacent bodies. In the 
tropics when ice is lacking, water is hung in porous jars in the 
breeze, and the temperature of the water in the jar is reduced. 

To keep milk and butter cool wrap a wet cloth about the 
containing jar, and set the jar upon the window sill, keeping 
one end of the towel in a vessel of water ; or the cloth may- 
be wrapped directly around the butter. This method is 
surprisingly effective. 

Fruit beverages. — Fruit juices with water and sugar 
make refreshing beverages and have nutritive value as well. 
(See the next chapter.) 

Cocoa and chocolate, coffee, and tea. — These are the 
three most important non-alcoholic beverages used by man. 
They are used because of the agreeable flavor given them by 
volatile oils, and also because they have a stimulating effect. 
The stimulating property is due to an alkaloid, a crystalliz- 
able substance known in cocoa as theobromine, in coffee as 
caffeine, and in tea as theine. Chemical investigation in- 
dicates that caffeine and theine are the same and theobromine 
is a closely related substance. These substances have a recog- 
nized stimulating effect upon the nervous system, and the 
beverages containing them should therefore be used with 
caution by all. In the opinion of the writers, tea and coffee 
should not be taken by young people under twenty-five years 
of age. Tea and coffee also contain tannin, an astringent 
substance giving a disagreeable flavor to coffee and tea when 
these are improperly made, and having an undesirable effect 
upon digestion. Chocolate contains a non-volatile fat (cocoa 
butter) in large amount, and should be classed as a food as 
well as a beverage. 

The plants from which cocoa, coffee, and tea are derived 
are natives of semi-tropical or tropical Africa, Asia, and 



76 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

America, having been introduced to Europe by early travel- 
ers in these lands. 

The introduction of these beverages is an interesting bit of his- 
tory. The Spaniards found cocoa in tropical America, and carried 
it back to Spain, and it was not used in England until 1657. It 
was sold in Danvers, Massachusetts, in 1771, the raw material 
having been brought by Gloucester fishermen from the West Indies. 
Coffee is said to have originated in Abyssinia, reaching Europe by 
way of Arabia, and being sold in England in 1650. Coffee-houses 
were licensed in America in 1715. A Chinese tradition places the 
discovery of the use of tea at 2700 B.C. It was first used in England 
in 1657, and was imported into America in 1711. An amusing 
story is told of the first tea party in a town of western 'Connecticut, 
where the tea was boiled violently in a large iron kettle and served 
on a platter with the leaves, as a form of soup, the leaves themselves 
being eaten. 

Cocoa and chocolate. — Cocoa and chocolate are manu- 
factured from the seed of a tree, Theobroma cacao, grown in 
tropical America. The seeds, when removed from the con- 
taining pod, are fermented to improve the flavor, dried, 
cleaned, roasted, and finally ground. The outer husk is 
loosened in the roasting, and, is then removed, and sold 
as " cocoa shells." It is the basis of a cheap beverage 
with an agreeable flavor. The first crushing of the seeds 
gives cocoa " nibs," and these are further ground in a mill, 
and finally molded into the cake of plain chocolate. The 
addition of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and sometimes other 
spices gives a variety of sweet chocolates. Powdered cocoa 
is prepared by the removal of the fat, which is a valuable 
product in itself, sugar and flavorings are added and some- 
times a starch. The Dutch manufacturers use alkalies 
for removing the crude fiber and improving the color, and 
the consequent loss of flavor is balanced by the use of other 
flavoring matter. The adulterations of cocoa are largely 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 77 

starch in excess. The French and American cocoas are 
flavored with vanilla, the Dutch manufacturers using cinna- 
mon as well. 

The so-called soluble cocoas are very finely ground, and 
therefore mix readily with water, remaining in suspension 
for some time, but the cocoa itself is not dissolved. Powdered 
cocoa is bought in tin cans, is cheap, and is even more eco- 
nomical if bought in large cans than in small. Chocolate is 
more expensive always than the cocoa, and may be bought 
in cakes in pound packages, or in powdered form for im- 
mediate use. 

Coffee is the inner seed of a berry from a tree, Coffea arabica, 
the process of manufacture consisting of the removal of the 
outer pulp, fermentation, washing, drying, and roasting. 
The first stages of the process are carried on at the coffee 
plantation, the raw berries being imported, and roasted 
shortly before using. The roasting in cocoa, coffee, and 
tea is necessary for desirable flavors, the heat developing 
volatile, aromatic principles, caramelizing the sugar, and 
causing other chemical changes. ' The differences in the flavor 
of coffees are due to the variety, the soil and climate, and 
methods of production and manufacture. No coffee grown 
in the western hemisphere has excelled, and scarcely has any 
equaled, the original Mocha and Java coffees, and these 
have long been trade names for coffee from other places, 
because of the popular liking for these brands. Brazil is 
now the great coffee producing country of the world, and from 
South and Central America and the West Indies we obtain 
coffee of excellent flavor. 

The adulterations of coffee should be noted, although 
these are of the kind that gives the buyer something cheaper 
in place of coffee, rather than a substance that is injurious. 
Ground chicory root is sometimes mixed with coffee, but 



78 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cannot be classed strictly as an adulterant, because many 
people, notably the French, add it openly, preferring its 
flavor. Among adulterants are rye meal, bran, beans and 
peas, cocoa shells, and even sawdust. Artificial beans have 
been made of bran, molasses, and water, sometimes with the 
addition of chicory and coloring matter. If ground coffee is 
put into a glass of cold water, it floats on the top and remains 
hard, while several of the adulterants named soften and sink 
to the bottom of the glass. Highly roasted coffee, however, 
will sometimes sink. Coffee beans from which coffee ex- 
tract has been made are sometimes mixed with other coffee. 

Coffee extracts and crystallized coffee are manufactured 
to simplify the coffee-making process, but the flavor is not 
equal to that of coffee infusion made directly from the bean. 
A preparation of coffee is also offered with the caffeine re- 
moved by some chemical process, but it is expensive in this 
country. 

Buy coffee in the bean, and see that it is freshly roasted. 
Coffee, whole or ground, is sold extensively by the pound in 
tin cans, with a fancy label and name, and in this form it is 
usually expensive. Good coffee may be bought for twenty- 
five cents a pound of many reliable dealers, and may be pur- 
chased in five or ten pound packages, or bought in bulk to be 
kept in a tightly closed can. 

Tea is the dried leaf of a shrub, Camellia ihea, growing in 
the comparatively high lands of Japan, China, India, and 
Ceylon. A tea plantation exists in South Carolina, U.S.A., 
and furnishes a very pleasing grade of tea, somewhat re- 
sembling Japan tea in flavor. We are familiar with the 
fact that there are many kinds and grades of tea, the tea 
shrub varying as does the coffee tree, and the methods of 
curing affecting both color and flavor. The teas from the 
countries named have characteristic flavors, and each 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 79 

country has different varieties and grades. Russian tea is 
not grown in Russia, but is Chinese tea carried across the 
continent of Asia. 

In general, tea may be classed as green or black, this 
difference in color depending upon the age of the leaf, and 
largely upon differences in the curing process. Green tea 
is made from the young leaf, and after picking is dried im- 
mediately by artificial heat, being constantly stirred for about 
an hour, in which time the leaves twist and curl. For black 
tea the leaves are allowed to wilt and ferment, before they 
are rolled and heated ; and sometimes the heating is repeated. 
These details of the process vary in different localities. The 
leaves are finally sorted and graded for packing. 

Both black and green teas are made in China. " Bohea " 
is one of the famous black Chinese teas. " English Breakfast 
Tea " is known as such only in America, and is a blend of 
black teas. Black tea is not so successfully made in Japan 
as in China. " Oolong," from the island of Formosa, has 
the appearance of a black tea, with the flavor of a green. 
In Japan and China old-time methods prevail, with much 
handling of the tea leaves, but in Ceylon and India modern 
machinery makes the process a much more cleanly one. 

Another classification of tea is that depending upon the 
age and size of the leaf, the young leaf making the finer grade 
tea. For example, in the black teas of India " flower y 
pekoe " is made from the youngest leaf, " orange pekoe " 
from the second, " pekoe " from the third, and " souchong " 
and " congou " come from the larger leaves. 

The adulterations of tea are usually the leaves of other 
plants, but as a matter of fact very little adulterated tea is 
imported. The first grades of teas, however, and those 
most highly prized by the Chinese and Japanese, seldom 
find their way to America. 



80 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other beverages. — Several very acceptable coffee sub- 
stitutes are on the market, made from roasted and ground 
grain, and they give an agreeable hot drink for breakfast 
when served with cream or milk. In some cases they seem 
to have a laxative effect, which is well for some people and 
not for others. A pleasant hot drink of the same nature 
may be made from the browned crusts of bread. 

The substitutes for tea are not usually satisfactory. The 
Indians of the western coast of the United States make a tea 
from a plant which they call " Buona Yerba," but for us it 
has a strong resemblance to the medicinal herb teas formerly 
used for curative purposes, such as sage, catnip, motherwort, 
and the like. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 
i. Lemonade and fruit drinks. 

Utensils. — Silver knife for paring and slicing, glass lemon 
squeezer, a grater, a strainer, and a saucepan. Avoid the 
use of tin and iron utensils. 

Materials. — Lemon or other fruits, sugar water. 

Proportions. — One half lemon to a glass, or 2 or 3 to a quart 
of water. Other fruits "according to taste." Experiment here, 
using the juice and pulp of any fruit, combining those that 
are very acid with those that lack acidity, — lemon and rasp- 
berry, for example. One third to J cup sugar to a quart. The 
proportion cannot be stated with exactness, for fruit varies in 
acidity, and the final result must always be tested by the taste. 

Method. 

Plain lemonade. — After deciding upon the proper amounts 
to be used, dissolve the sugar in a part of the water, brought 
to the boiling point. When cool, add the lemon juice and re- 
maining water, ice and serve. A small portion of grated rind 
may be added to the boiling water. 

Another method is to use lump sugar, rubbing the peel of the 
lemon upon each lump before dissolving. 

The general method is the same with other fruits, pulpy fruit 
and berries being mashed, the water added, and strained. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 81 

Cherries, strawberries, and pieces of pulp are sometimes added 
before serving, when the fruit drink is ladled from a bowl as 
fruit punch. Be sure to cut the berries if they are large. A 
brightness is imparted to the fruit punch by the addition of 
carbonated water just before serving. A quart of fruit punch, 
if served in small cups, will suffice for eight people. 

2. Cocoa shells.' 

Principle. — To extract the flavor from the shells, by boiling 
in water. 

Utensil. — A saucepan or coffee boiler. 

Proportions. — One half cup shells to 1 quart boiling water. 
As much as 1 cup of the shells may be used. 

Method. 

Wash the shells in a strainer under the faucet. Put the 
shells in the pot, pour on boiling water, and simmer gently for 
| hour. Strain off, and serve with cream, or milk, or evap- 
orated milk and sugar. 

3. Cocoa. 

Principle. — To mix the particles smoothly and evenly with 
the liquid by stirring and by heating. 

Utensils. — A measuring cup, a saucepan, spoon, and beater. 
A double boiler, if milk only is used. 

Ingredients. ■ — Powdered cocoa, sugar, water, or milk, or 
milk and water. Cocoa made with milk does not agree with 
some people, in which case it may be made with water only, 
and served with cream, milk, or evaporated milk. 

Proportions. — One teaspoonful of cocoa to J measuring cup. 
More' or less as preferred. One teaspoonful of sugar, ditto. 

Method. 

Heat the liquid. Stir a portion of the liquid cold, with 
the cocoa, add this to the hot liquid, add the sugar, and beat 
vigorously for a minute before removing from the fire. 

4. Chocolate. 

Principle. — To mix the chocolate smoothly with the liquid 

that the fat may not float on the top. This is accomplished 

■ by having all the ingredients either hot or cold. If after the 

chocolate is dissolved in a hot liquid, cold liquid is added, the 

oil separates and floats. 



82 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Utensils. — A grater, or sharp knife, a saucepan, mixing 
spoon, and beater. 

A French chocolate maker claims that any metal utensil 
affects the flavor of the chocolate, and always uses an earthen 
pot and wooden spoon and heater. An earthenware choco- 
late pot for this purpose is on the market. 

Ingredients. — Chocolate, sugar, milk, or milk and water. 

Proportions. — The amount of chocolate may be varied, de- 
pending upon the richness desired. Three or 4 ounce squares 
to 1 quart liquid, 4 teaspoonfuls sugar to 1 quart. The liquid 
is better half milk and half water, rather than milk only. 

Method I. 1 

The cold method. 

Put the liquid and sugar into the saucepan. Break or cut 
the chocolate into small pieces, add to the liquid, and heat the 
liquid slowly, stirring occasionally but not constantly. When 
the liquid is hot, just before it reaches the boiling point, beat 
vigorously with a wooden spoon, or beater. The Dover 
beater is convenient. This beating makes a velvety smooth 
and a foamy mixture. 

Method B. 1 

The hot method. 

Heat the liquid with the sugar. Grate the chocolate or shave 
it with a knife. Protect the chocolate from the warmth of 
the fingers by a piece of paper. The process is less " sticky " 
if the chocolate and grater are chilled in the refrigerator. 
Just as the liquid is reaching the boiling point, pour in the 
grated chocolate, and beat vigorously. 1 

* Beaten chocolate does not need any additional cream when 
served. Beaten whipped cream is attractive on the top of each 
cup. But remember that chocolate is already rich in fat, and 
that additional fat may be indigestible. Such a cup of choco- 
late taken for luncheon with a roll is sufficient for the meal, and 
is certainly too rich in fat for serving at x an afternoon tea. 

5. Coffee. 

Principle. — To extract the flavoring oils at the boiling point 
of water, and to avoid the extraction of the tannin. The 



1 Both these methods were taught by French cooks connected with well 
known chocolate firms, and both give good results.

drip coffee. 



tannin is extracted by prolonged boiling, and when the liquid 

coffee stands upon the grounds. 

Utensils. — Coffee grinder, measuring cup, pot. The kind of 

pot depends upon the method used. One house furnishing 

firm displays some 

seventy different 

coffee pots, but 

they may be di- 
vided into three 

classes, the pot for 

boiling, the drip 

coffee pot, and the 

percolator (see Figs. 

23 and 24). The 

coffee boiler should 

have a lip, and not 

a spout. A word 

of warning is needed in regard to the care of the pot. Coffee 

grounds should be removed from any pot immediately, and the 

pot washed at once in scalding hot soapsuds, rinseoj, dried, and 

aired. Let the pot stand with 
cover off. If this is not done, a 
coat is soon formed on the inside 
of the pot, which spoils the flavor 
of the coffee. Where the pot has 
been neglected, boiling it out with 
a solution of caustic soda is some- 
times a remedy. 

Ingredients. — Ground coffee, 
water, cold or boiling, white of 
egg or egg shell for boiled coffee. 
The coffee should be ground to 
medium fineness for boiled coffee, 
to a finer powder for the per- 
colated and drip coffee. 

Proportions. — One part of 

coffee to 5 or 6 of water, depending upon the strength desired. 

One egg shell, or half the white of an egg to 1 cup of ground 

coffee.

84 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method 1. 

Boiling. — ■ Measure the coffee and water. Stir the white or 
the shell of an egg with the coffee, adding a little of the water, put 
this into the pot, add the remaining water cold, stir thoroughly, 
allow the water to rise slowly to the boiling point, and to boil 
one minute, remove the pot from the fire, pour in a 
small amount of cold water, and let the coffee stand for 
five minutes or until the grounds settle. During the cooking 
close the lip with clean soft paper if it has no lid. The 
actual boiling is continued for a brief period only, and coffee 
made by this method is considered by some people to have a 
flavor lacking in drip or percolator coffee. The egg is added 
to clarify the coffee. Pour off the liquid coffee from the grounds, 
and keep hot until it is time to serve it. 

A second method differs from this in that the water is poured 
on at the boiling temperature, allowed to reach the boiling 
point in two or three minutes, and boiled for five minutes. 
The first gives uniformly better results. It is true, however, 
that different kinds of coffee need different treatment, and 
there is room here for much experimenting. 

Method 2. 

Drip coffee. — In this method the coffee is put in a recep- 
tacle above, the water passes slowly through, collecting in the 
pot below, from which it is served. Stand the lower part 
of the pot in a pan of hot water, or where it will keep hot. 
Measure the water, and bring it to the boiling point. Heat 
the ground coffee slightly, put it in the upper section of the 
pot, and pour on the water very slowly. Of course, the water 
is not actually boiling when it touches the coffee. If the liquid 
coffee is not strong enough, pour it from the lower part and 
pass it through the grounds again. This is the French method, 
and is an excellent way to prepare after-dinner coffee. 

Method 3. 

Percolator coffee. — In the percolator the water boils within 
the pot, and passes through the coffee at the boiling tem- 
perature. The exact method depends upon the pattern of 
the pot, and directions always accompany a given pot. For 
those who can use electricity, the electric percolator certainly 
gives an excellent coffee. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 85 

Coffee is served "black," or with cream, milk, or evaporated 
milk and sugar. If milk is used for breakfast coffee, serve it hot. 

6. Tea. 

Principle. — To extract flavor by allowing the leaves to re- 
main for a few minutes, in water which has been, poured on 
at the boiling temperature, and to avoid the extraction of 
tannin by making the period of steeping short. Tea must 
never be boiled. 

Utensils. — An earthen pot, measuring cup, teaspoon, 
strainer. Sometimes a tea ball or piece of cheesecloth. 

Proportion. — One teaspoonful of tea to about 1 cup of 
water, the amount depending upon the kind of tea. 

Method. — Measure the water and bring it to the boiling 
point. Heat the tea slightly in the pot, pour on the water 
rapidly, allow to stand three to five minutes, strain into a 
heated pot for serving. The length of the steeping depends 
also upon the kind of tea. If there is an astringent flavor, the 
tea has stood too long. 

The following method was recommended by an expert in 
India teas. Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, throw 
in the tea leaves, lift the saucepan instantly to stop the boil- 
ing, steep for 3 or 4 minutes, strain off and keep hot. This 
expert claimed that by actually having the tea leaves at the 
boiling temperature for an instant the flavor is improved. 
Serve with cream or milk, or sliced lemon and sugar. 

Where tea is to be served in very large quantities, this last 
method is very convenient. The water can be brought to the 
boil in a large kettle, and the tea thrown in, but care must be 
exercised to see that the steeping does not last too long. The 
tea, once decanted, can be kept hot for several hours, without 
losing flavor. Or again, a small amount of extra strong tea 
may be prepared, to be diluted with boiling water as it is 
served. The tea ball, or the plan of tying the tea in small 
pieces of cheesecloth, is convenient for serving at an after- 
noon tea. 

7. Iced cocoa, coffee, and tea. 

Cocoa and coffee are agreeable in hot weather served in a 
glass with ice, and cream and powdered sugar. Make both 



86 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

slightly stronger than for hot drinks, as the ice in melting 
dilutes the liquid. 

Iced tea. — Prepare a small amount of strong tea, using 4 
teaspoonfuls to 1 eup boiling water, strain off and cool. Dilute 
with iced water to the proper strength, sweeten with powdered 
sugar, and serve in glasses with one or two slices of lemon to 
each glass. For those who do not like the lemon, iced tea may 
be served with cream. 

EXERCISES 

1. What are the functions of water in the body? 

2. What cautions should be exercised when drinking water? 

3. Explain the likenesses and differences of cocoa and chocolate, 
coffee and tea. 

4. Why is it better to serve whipped cream with cocoa, rather 
than with chocolate? 

5. Explain the principles in making each beverage. 



Teacher's Note. — The beverages are treated in one chapter for con- 
venience, but need not of necessity come at the beginning of the course. 
A fruit beverage, or cocoa, may make a convenient first lesson, when the 
pupils are becoming acquainted with the school kitchen. Coffee and tea 
may be made during the baking lessons. 



CHAPTER VI 
FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 

The United States is fortunate in the native fruit supply, 
including as it does so many degrees of latitude and longitude 
with the differences in altitude, climate, and soil needed by 
different varieties. Now that we count Porto Rico among 
our possessions, a list of our fruits would include most of the 
varieties known in the temperate and semi-tropical zones. 
The United States Department of Agriculture experiments 
with new varieties from foreign lands that may make them- 
selves at home in our soil, and work like that of Luther Bur- 
bank produces new species. Scientific methods of fruit 
growing are becoming more common, and the quality of 
fruit will doubtless improve in spite of fungous diseases and 
injurious insects. Our wild fruits are not yet entirely rooted 
out. The Maine blueberry, for example, is found on hundreds 
of acres and needs no cultivation beyond burning over every 
third year. 

Fruit is necessary in our diet, and is not an extravagance 
unless we buy fancy varieties brought from a distance, or 
native fruits out of season. 

Composition and nutritive value. — The chief foodstuffs 
in fruits are carbohydrates and mineral matter. Fresh 
fruit contains from 75 to 95 per cent of water, and its presence 
is apparent in such juicy fruits as the melon and the orange. 
Figure 25 shows that seemingly dry fruits like the banana 
and ,the apple also contain much water. Even fruits which 
have been artificially dried, like prunes and raisins, contain

are largely in the form of sugars easily digested and valuable

processes of the body than that prescribed medicinally. 
The bulk given by cellulose, and the laxative property of 
fruit acids also are safeguards against constipation, especially 
in a meat diet. Fruit is the best possible dessert after, a 
hearty meat dinner. 

The digestibility of fruit is increased for some people by 
cooking. This is probably due to the softening of the fiber, 
to the destruction of any bacteria present, and in the case of 
the banana, to the cooking of the starch. Fruit juice can 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 91 

be taken by little children and invalids who might find the 
fiber troublesome. Some people cannot eat berries on ac- 
count of irritation caused by the seeds. In this case, juice 
may be squeezed from cooked berries and used for beverages 
and jelly. ^ 

How to buy. — Since we should eat fruit daily, and not 
merely as a " treat," it is important to practice economy in 
buying it. Fresh fruits in season, and dried fruits are the 
cheapest. Canned fruit is economical when it is a product 
of one's own garden, or put up when some fruit has a low 
market price. Prices are so variable, even with one variety, 
that no definite sum can be given as a fixed price. Apples 
vary from fifty cents a bushel near the orchard and in season, 
to ten cents apiece for a fancy table variety in the winter. 
When you buy fresh fruit, inquire the prices of the many kinds 
offered, note which is cheapest, and then observe whether 
the cheaper kind is such because it is abundant, or because it 
is of inferior quality. If you chance to want apples for cook- 
ing, and the only cheap apples are spotted and bruised, then 
buy dried apples, or even canned. It is best to decide upon 
the fruit after you have studied market conditions rather than 
before.

Methods. 

Berries. — Pick over. 
Wash in colander with a gentle stream of water, and shake 

carefully to avoid bruising and breaking. 
Chill in the refrigerator. 
Sprinkle with sugar when served. 
Oranges. — Scrub the peel with a brush. 

(1) Cut in two crosswise and serve. 

(2) Peel with a sharp knife and remove the pith. 

Cut crosswise, remove seeds, and break up the slices. 

Sprinkle with sugar. 
Chill in the refrigerator. 
Grapefruit. — The same method as with the orange, but in 

method (2) the pulp only should be served. 
Bananas. — Wash thoroughly. 

(1) Cut in two lengthwise, and serve, or 

Pour a teaspoonful of lemon juice on each half, and 

sprinkle with sugar. 
Chill in the refrigerator. ' 

(2) Pull off the skin, lengthwise. 
Cut in slices crosswise. 

Chill, and serve with sugar and cream, or 

Pour on lemon or orange juice, add sugar, and chill. 
Peaches. — Wash gently. 

Hold the peach on a fork at one end. 

Peel with a plated knife, and slice. 

Chill in the refrigerator for a short time only before serving, 
as peaches discolor quickly. 

Sprinkle with sugar when served. 
Pears and apples. — When very mellow, these are delicious 

sliced and served with sugar and cream. 
Fruit juice. — Cut the fruit in two, and press on the glass squeezer 

over a cup. 

Cooked Fruits 
Principles of cooking. 

The fiber, and skin when retained, are softened. 

Flavors are developed at a low temperature long continued. A 

high temperature at the end of process, browns, and adds 

flavor. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 93 

Flavors retained by prevention of evaporation through covering 

tightly. 
Bacteria and molds are destroyed. 
Adjuncts. — Sugar. Sometimes a bit of butter. 
Acid fruit juices, or 
An acid jelly. 

Seeded raisins, with acid fruit, as sour apples. 
Nutmeg or cinnamon with some fruits. 
Cooking processes. — Stewing and baking. 
Utensils. — Knife and corer. 

Stew pan, enamel ware, close cover. 
Round or square baking pans, enamel ware, covered. 
Earthenware pot, covered. 
Methods. — If you can pook one fruit, you can cook all. Two 
common fruits are selected for your experiments, the apple 
and the prune ; both are delicious, and both contain iron, 
the prune more than the apple. 

The apple. — A tart variety is best for cooking. The Greening 

and the Baldwin are excellent. 
Apples are cooked whole, or as a sauce. 
Whole, cooked with or without the skin, either stewed or 

baked. 
For cooking whole, select those of uniform size. 
For cooking whole, with the skin, select those with fair skins. 
For cooking whole without skin, select firm texture, not mellow. 
An apple sauce may consist of slices, or may be mashed or strained, 

and may be either stewed or baked. Less perfect apples 

may be used than for baking. 
First step for all. — Wash, and examine carefully for blemishes, 

bruises, and insects in the interior. 

i. Whole apple baked, with skin. 

(1) Remove core. 

(2) Place in pan, with enough water to barely cover the 

bottom of the pan. 

(3) Pour sugar into the holes. 

(4) A bit of butter may be put on the top of the sugar. 

(5) Nutmeg or cinnamon may be mixed with the sugar if 

the apples are flat in taste. 



94 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) Cover the pan, and bake in a moderate oven, until the 
apples are tender. The length of time depends upon 
the quality of the apple. (See class experiment.) 
Half apples. — This is a modification of (1). 

Cut the apples in two crosswise, and proceed as with the 
whole apple. 

2. Whole apples baked, without skin. — A good method when skins 

are tough. 

(1) Remove core and pare. 

(2) Place in earthen baking dish. The remainder of the 

process is the same. 

(3) Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

(4) Currant jelly, or seeded raisins may be placed in the core 

holes instead of sugar. 

Class experiment. — Bake side by side two apples of uniform 
size, one with, one without, the skin. Note carefully the length 
of time for baking each. What difference? Why is this? It 
may be necessary in the school kitchen to bake in a quick oven, 
on account of the shortness of the class period. It does not spoil 
the apple to do this ; but the longer process that you can use at 
home gives a richer color and flavor. 

For this experiment, one pupil may bake the apple without the 
skin, and the next pupil one with the skin in case there is but one 
apple apiece ; or it may be made a class experiment with two apples. 

3. Whole, stewed. (Compote.) — This is a more difficult method 

than method 2, and really no better. 

(1) Core and pare five or six apples. 

(2) Dissolve | cup sugar in J pint water in a saucepan. 

(3) Place apples in the sirup. They should be barely 

covered. 

(4) Cover closely and keep just below the boiling point, 

until the apples are tender. 

(5) Cool slightly, remove the apples with care and place in 

the serving dish. Put a spoonful of jelly in each apple. 

(6) Boil down the sirup and pour it over the apples. 

(7) Chill, before serving with plain or whipped cream. 

4. Apple sauces. — In the cooking of the whole apple you have 

all the principles and processes of apple cooking. You 
can now make apple sauce of your own invention, and need 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 95 

no printed directions. Answer these questions before you 
begin work. After you have made the sauce, record the 
work exactly in your notebook. 

If you want the slices of appie to remain whole, will the method 
be like i, 2, or 3? 

If you wish a smooth sauce, what utensil will you need? 

How will you determine the amount of sugar required? If 
you are very fond of sugar, your taste may not be the safest guide. 

Practical home work. — If you can secure a very slow oven, say a 
coal oven at night, or a gas oven with a low flame, make an apple 
sauce in an earthenware pot, as heavy as a bean pot, closely covered, 
leaving the pot in the oven from six to eight hours. This process is 
satisfactory in a flreless cooker where a hot stone or iron is used. 
Remember that water keeps down temperature, and also that it 
evaporates steadily even in a slow oven. How much water will you 
put over the apples when the process begins? 

If you have never cooked apples in this way you will be sur- 
prised at the color and flavor. 

Some other fruits. — Pears and quinces develop pleasing flavors 
when baked. 

Cook the quinces sliced, as suggested for the apples, in the bean 
pot, using a little molasses for sweetening and you will have the 
delicious old-time " molasses quince." 

Prunes. — We are dealing now with a dried fruit. If you com- 
pare the raisins with the grapes in Fig. 26, you will see how much 
water is lost in the drying process. The same difference would be 
evident if you had pictures of a fresh plum and a prune, side by side. 
This water must be supplied in the process of preparation. The 
best way to accomplish this is by soaking the prunes many hours, 
say over night. Prunes have a most undeserved reputation, because 
they are not well cooked, and at some tables are served too often. 

With this one new step introduced you may plan the cooking 
of the prunes, from what you know of apple sauce. The slower 
and longer the process, the better. The cheaper kinds of prunes 
will be very satisfactory, with the soaking and slow cooking. What 
is the sensible thing to do in regard to sugar? 

If on some occasion you would like prunes to % be unusually nice, 
remove the stones carefully, and in their places slip in seeded raisins 
which have also been soaked and gently stewed. 



96 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other dried fruits may be treated in the same way. 
Apricots and peaches yield delightful flavors when carefully 
prepared ; and dried apples are also excellent. 

Preservation of Fruit and Other Foods 

The preservation of fruit and other foods has been a house- 
hold industry for generations, and it is now an important 
commercial industry. The old-time farm had its smoke- 
house where hams and beef were " cured," the barrel of brine 
stood in the cellar for pork and corned beef, apples and 
corn were dried for winter use, and rows of preserve jars 
stood upon the shelves. Food was preserved by simple 
processes long before the reason for the decay and spoiling 
of food was fully understood, but with larger knowledge and 
better appliances, we now preserve food more effectively and 
in quantities larger than were possible in former days. 

Fruit is the food material now most commonly preserved 
in the home kitchen. Vegetables need to be subjected to 
heat for a much longer time than fruit, and maily people 
prefer to buy canned vegetables rather than to go to the 
trouble and expense of canning them at home. Where 
there is an oversupply of vegetables in the home garden, it 
is sometimes economy to can them, and this may be done if 
care is exercised. The cost of fuel and labor must be counted 
in, when studying the question of home preserving versus 
buying the canned product. 

Whatever the food material, and the process, the principles 
of preservation are the same for all. 

Why does food spoil ? — The decay and moldiness of 
fresh fruit are matters of common observation ; and the 
housekeeper knows that mold is liable to cover the top of a 
jelly glass, and 'that a can of fruit will ferment at times, 
even to the point of bursting the can. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 



97 



We recognize another kind of deterioration in meat and 
fish that have become tainted, even when no mold is visible, 
and there is no opportunity for ordinary fermentation. The 
microscope has given us eyes to see, and as a result of the 
patient work of the scientist with this instrument we now 
know that the difficulties in keeping food are caused by the 
presence of minute vegetable organisms known as molds, 




Buchanan's Household Bacteriology.

yeasts, and bacteria. It is impossible in some cases to draw 
a sharp line between these different forms of lower life, yet 
we are able to distinguish them sufficiently for practical 
purposes. 

Masses of mold that can be seen with the naked eye are 
distinguished by a feathery appearance and bright color. 
Figure 28 shows three species of the green mold that affects 
jam and jellies. Other species are found in Roquefort 
and Camembert cheese, and give the flavors characteristic 
in these cheeses. 

The presence of yeast can be detected by its action, but it 
cannot itself be seen without the microscope. When canned 
fruit or homemade fruit juice " works," yeasts cells are

present in great number. Figure 29 shows one form of

with some flour or flour and meal, and the cells lie dormant 
in the cake, until we are ready to use them in bread. (See 
Chapter XII.) The actual yeast, however, is what Fig. 
30 shows it to be, a tiny, one-celled 
plant, increasing in number by the 
division of the single cell, or by the 
budding out of one cell from another. 
When conditions are favorable the 
yeast cells increase in number with 
great rapidity, and some of the sugar 
that is present is broken down into 
carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. It 
is this gas that causes the familiar 
bubbling when fermentation is taking place. We put yeast 
cells into bread and cultivate it for this gas. But how does 
it occur in canned fruits, when its presence is not desired? 
Wild yeast floats in the air, and lies upon the surface of fruit. 
All cultivated yeast has been derived from wild yeast. In 
old-fashioned ways of bread-making no yeast was introduced,

a soft dough being left in a warm place to ferment naturally, 
the yeast cells probably being present in the flour. The 
yeast that spoils the canned fruit is present in the fruit, in 
the utensils, or can, and has not been killed as it should be 
in the canning process. 

The bacteria are also one-celled microorganisms, smaller 
than the yeast. Figure 31 shows the four types of bacterial 
cells. Their size is measured by the unit used in the

microscope, called the micron, which is about 25 oo t of one 
inch. Bacteria may measure from one to three or four of 
these microns in length. Some bacteria are reproduced by 
means of spores which form within the cell. Bacteria, as 
they develop in some material, produce substances from the 
material that may or may not be injurious to us. One im- 
portant truth about the bacteria is this : that many of them 
are harmless, and may even be made useful, as in the 
manufacture of fruit vinegar. The pleasant acid of butter- 
milk and of sour milk is due also to bacteria which are 
not harmful to us. However, there may be disease pro- 
ducing bacteria present in milk that is not clean, and 
their presence must not be tolerated. Other bacteria, de- 



100 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

veloping in meat and fish, produce substances known as 
ptomaines, which are dangerous poisons ; or, more often, the 
kinds of bacteria, which thrive in meats and fish may them- 
selves be directly injurious to man. 

It is evident, therefore, that the problem before us is the 
control of these lower organisms, that we may increase or 
destroy them as we will. 

The control of micro6rganisms. — With warmth, water, 
and food all living things flourish and grow ; most organisms 
require air, but some of the microorganisms do not. Where 
these conditions are best met, the organism is most active 
and multiplies most rapidly. To retard growth or to destroy 
life, the conditions must be the reverse of favorable. While 
warmth, say a temperature from 70° to 90° F., promotes the 
life of most microorganisms, intense heat destroys it. The 
boiling temperature, 212° F., will kill these lower organisms, 
although this heat has to be continued for some length of 
time, particularly in the case of spores. The spores of 
certain bacteria are quite resistant. A temperature of 32° F. 
and lower retards growth, but it requires extreme cold to 
destroy bacteria. Since moisture is necessary to all the lower 
organisms, they do not develop in a dry material or dry 
place. 

We cannot destroy these lower forms of life by removing 
food from them, since they are ever present, but we can 
make the food unavailable to them through the introduction 
in the material of certain substances called preservatives 
which prevent their growth. The preservatives long familiar 
are salt, sugar, wood-smoke, spices, vinegar, and alcohol. 
While a small amount of sugar is necessary in the fermenta- 
tion process, a large amount acts as a preservative, as in 
candied fruit. It is an interesting fact that alcohol and 
vinegar, products of fermentation processes, tend (when 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 101 

sufficiently concentrated) to stop the growth of the fermen- 
tation organisms. 

To the reader who desires a fuller account of the bacteria, 
yeast, and molds, especially as related to household affairs, 
Buchanan's "Household Bacteriology" is recommended as 
the most recent and satisfactory book in this field. 

A word about buying canned goods. — When canned goods 
are put up in large quantities at the factory, abuses are likely 
to exist. Poor, even decayed, fruit may be used, the whole 
process may be unclean from beginning to end, and unde- 
sirable preservatives or an excess of sugar or spice may be in- 
troduced to cover the use of poor materials or methods. The 
condition of the worker in the cannery is one of the important 
industrial problems at the present time. Unhappily, poor 
conditions do often exist in canneries that turn out a cheap 
product. On the other hand, there are firms that may well 
take pride in their system from beginning to end. 

Serving canned food. — All canned food should be ex- 
posed to the air for a short time before serving, and stirred 
that the material may be aerated. This partially removes a 
certain flatness of taste. Canned fruit is improved by re- 
heating, even. 

When possible, vegetables bought in a tin can should be 
washed in the colander before they are heated. This greatly 
improves the flavor.

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. — Thoroughly wash all the utensils, just 
before using. Sterilize the cans and glasses by placing them in a 
large kettle or boiler on the stove, covering them with cold water,

and allowing the water to reach the boiling point and to boil for 
half an hour. Covers and rubber rings should be treated in the 
same way. 

Prepare the fruit by careful washing, picking over, paring and 
cutting. 

The skins may be loosened on peaches and tomatoes by pouring 
hot water over them. 

Weigh both fruit and sugar, or measure if no scales are available. 

See that the cooking apparatus is in good order, that the proper 
heat may be continued. 

Avoid rapid boiling of the fruit. 



104 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Place the cans when they are to be filled with hot fruit upon a 
towel wet in very hot water, or in a pan holding an inch or so of 
hot water. Never hold the can or glass in the hand. 

Use a dipper for putting cooked fruit into the can. A funnel is 
useful placed in the mouth of the jar. 

Put whole fruit and halves compactly in the jar, using table- 
spoon and fork, or two tablespoons. It requires practice to do this 
well. 

See that all air bubbles are removed, and fill the cans to over- 
flowing, before putting on the glass tops and fastening on the spring. 
Wipe off the jars, carefully, and stand them on their tops for a day 
in order to test the tightness of the rubbers and the fastening. 

After filling jelly glasses, set them at one side, and cover them 
all with a piece of cheesecloth, until the jelly becomes firm. Then 
pour melted paraffin upon the jelly in each glass, and when the 
paraffin is cooled, put the covers on firmly. 

Label the jars with the name of the fruit and the date of the 
preserving before putting them away. 

Canning. 

Method 1 . — Material cooked before it is put into the can. This 
is a good method for berries, and for fruit that will be served as a 
sauce. Proceed in the preparation and finishing according to the 
general directions. Cook the fruit gently for half an hour. Use 
as little water as possible. No sugar is required in the canning pro- 
cess, but the flavor is better if a small amount is used in the begin- 
ning, a half cup of sugar to a pound of fruit. 

Method 2. — Material cooked in the can. This is the better 
method for whole fruit and halves. Select firm, well-shaped fruit 
for this method, rejecting the mellow and soft fruit. Pack the cans 
tightly with the fruit, and pour in hot water with sugar dissolved 
in it, a half cup to the quart can. More sugar can be used, if 
so desired. Set the jars in a boiler on a rack, and surround them 
with warm water, to a height that will not allow the water to boil 
into the cans. 

Set the cover on each jar, but do not fasten them. Cover the 
boiler closely, bring the water to a boil, and allow it to boil for an 
hour. At the end of this time, test the fruit for tenderness with a 
fork, pour in more sirup if it is necessary. Remove the jars when 
the water has cooled sufficiently, and adjust the covers. Cold 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 105 

water is sometimes used at the beginning, but this makes the 
process longer. 

This is a good method also for the canning of whole vegetables 
like peas and asparagus. The cooking of vegetables should con- 
tinue for at least two hours, and three hours are better for peas and 
string beans. 

Apparatus is constructed for this method of canning, but the 
ordinary boiler answers the purpose. 

Preserving. 

A good method for peaches, apricots, and quinces. Select firm 
and handsome fruit and prepare it carefully. Allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. (What is the measure of a pound of 
sugar?) Place enough water in the kettle to cover the fruit, dis- 
solve the sugar in the water, put the fruit into the kettle, and cook 
very gently until the fruit becomes a clear color. Rapid boiling 
spoils the shape of the fruit. Do not stir at all, but skim off any 
scum that rises to the top. When the fruit is done, put it with 
great care into the jars. If the sirup is thin, boil it down for a 
short time, and then fill the jar. Close the jar as in canning. 

This is a difficult process for beginners. 

Jam making, and fruit butter. 

This is the most economical of the preserving processes and the 
easiest for the novice. It is nothing more than a fruit sauce, with 
a larger amount of sugar than usual to assist in its preservation. 

Soft and somewhat imperfect fruit may be used. If in the 
basket of fruit bought for canning or preserving there are some 
fully ripe or poorly shaped specimens, these may be used for jam. 
For jam proper allow a pint of sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook the 
fruit with enough water to prevent its sticking to the kettle, using 
as little as possible. 

Mash the fruit by stirring it occasionally as it cooks. When the 
fruit is soft, add the sugar, stir thoroughly, and cook gently for 
about five minutes. Test by cooling a spoonful on a saucer. The 
jam should thicken slightly. When ready, pour it into jelly glasses, 
or somewhat larger earthen jars — _" jam pots." Seal, as directed 
for jelly. 

The fruit butter is even more like fruit sauce than is the jam, for 
it is softer than jam, and contains less sugar. A cup or only a half 



106 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cup of sugar to the pound of fruit is enough. Proceed exactly as 
in jam-making. 

Apple butter may be flavored with spices, with ginger root and 
lemon juice, and with other fruits. One or two quinces or a slice 
of pineapple cooked with the apples gives a pleasing variety. 
Exercise the inventive faculty here. 

Jelly making. — There is another principle involved in jelly 
making in addition to the principle of preservation. Fruit contains 
a substance kno^n as pectose, one of the carbohydrates, that 
partially solidifies the fruit juice when the water in the juice is 
partially evaporated. The addition of sugar helps in this process, 
but no amount of sugar will set the jelly if the pectose is not present. 
Some fruits have more than others, and also more when not over- 
ripe. Currants and firm apples are good jelly makers, and serve 
as a basis for other fruits that do not jelly well. Mellow summer 
apples do not set well. Crab apples are excellent for this pur- 
pose. 

There is another step in this process, the straining out of the 
juice from the pulp. For this, prepare a jelly bag from firm cotton 
cloth which has been boiled and washed. This bag must be hung 
in such a way that the juice drops from the point of the bag into a 
bowl below. It may be hung upon a stick between two chairs, or 
upon the rod of a strong towel rack over a table. 

i. Apple jelly. — Select tart, red-skinned apples, cut them in small 
pieces with the skins on, retain the cores, and put them in 
a kettle with cold water to barely cover. When thoroughly 
cooked and mashed, put this pulp into the jelly bag, and 
allow the juice to drip as long as it will. Do not squeeze 
the bag, nor stir the pulp if you wish clear jelly. This drip- 
ping process is a matter of hours, and in the home kitchen 
may continue all night. Allow a pint of sugar to a pint of 
juice. Return the juice to the kettle, and allow it to simmer 
for twenty-five minutes or half an hour, skimming when 
necessary. In the meantime, heat the sugar, being careful 
not to melt or burn it. Stir the sugar gently into the juice, 
and boil five minutes. Test a little upon a saucer. It should 
show signs of jellying as it cools. Boil longer, if necessary. 
Finish as directed. Jelly often does not set until twenty-four 
hours have elapsed. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 107 

2. Currant jelly. — The method is the same as with apple jelly. 
It is not necessary to remove the currants from the stem. 
Heat just long enough before the straining to make the juices 
flow well. 

Very agreeable flavors are secured by the combining of two 
or more fruits in a jelly ; quince and pineapple with apple ; 
— a leaf of rose geranium or lemon verbena in a glass of apple 
jelly ; raspberry with currant. White apple jelly may be 
flavored with mint leaves, and used in place of mint sauce with 
meat. 

Pickling. 

Pickles are not desirable in the diet. If acid is craved, it is 
much wiser to secure it by fresh fruits, and by the use of lemon 
juice. 

Drying. 

This process should not be discarded if there is a supply of fruit 
in the orchard or garden. Place thinly sliced apples and peaches 
upon plates or trays, protect by clean cheesecloth, and dry in the 
sun. The color may be dark, but the flavor is excellent.

but some fruit is available at any time of year : in the winter, apple and 
peach butter from the dried fruit; in the spring rhubarb jam or jelly; in the 
late spring or early summer, strawberry jam. If the school program and the 
equipment permit the serving of meals by the class, fruit may be preserved 
in the fall for these occasions.

CHAPTER VII 

VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 

The distinction between the fruit and the vegetable is 
purely arbitrary, since both are parts of plants and have the 
same general composition. Botanically the tomato is as 
truly a fruit as the apple ; but when it is stewed and served 
with meat, it is classed as a vegetable. Other parts of 
plants, however, besides the fruit are used as- vegetables. 

Composition and nutritive value. — Vegetables are much 
like fruits in composition, being richest usually in carbohy- 
drates and ash, but sometimes containing a large amount of 
protein. Some have carbohydrates in the form of starch, 
as the potato, and others in the form of sugar, as the beet ; 
young corn is rich in sugar, old corn in starch. All have 
more or less cellulose, that in lettuce being very tender, 
while that in beets is so firm as to be softened only by 
long cooking. Study carefully Figs. 34 and 35. Notice how 
the amount of water compares with the amount in fruits. 
See, too, that beans, both green and dry, are richer in protein 
than other vegetables. Celery has the highest percentage 
of water, and is valuable for its ash and the bulk it gives 
because of the large amount of cellulose. 

To explain these facts we must understand something of 
the physiology of the plant. The stem is the carrier of water 
and nutritive material to other parts of the plant. The 
onion bulb, the parsnip root, and the potato tuber are the 
winter storehouses of food for the next year's plant when the

leaves first sprout. In the dry bean seed, and also in the 
pea and lentil, the young plant lies dormant, with a large 
supply of all the foodstuffs ready for its first growth when 
warmth and moisture are supplied in the spring. Classified 
according to their nutritive value, the vegetables rank as 
follows. Leaves are grouped with stems. 

The seeds Contain all the foodstuffs. High in

Roots and tubers Contain all the foodstuffs. Low in 

and the bulb protein and fat. High in starch 

or some form of sugar. 
Rinds (squash and Contain all the foodstuffs in small

chief value. 
Leaves and stems Mineral content the chief value. 

Certain substances in some vegetables are supposed to have 
a physiological effect, but we should be cautious in accepting 
statements that have not been scientifically proved ; for 
instance, that celery is "good for the nerves." It is doubt- 
less true that the oils which give onions and the cabbage 
their strong flavors do not agree with some people, and these 
vegetables should be eaten with caution. 

How to buy. — Much interest is added to the study of 
vegetables by the examination of a seed catalogue easily 
obtainable from a firm selling seeds and plants. In this 
way, one may increase one's knowledge of varieties for 
planting in the home garden, even if they are not common on 
the market. City markets offer an increasing variety of 
vegetables, and the purchaser should not hesitate to buy a 
vegetable because it is new to her. An inexpensive Italian 
vegetable, fenucchi, is now sometimes found on sale, and its 
characteristic flavor is very agreeable. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 113 







114 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The season of vegetables is so extended by canning, by 
the shipping of vegetables from the South, and by growing 
under glass that there is always a wide range of choice. 
There are in winter, however, some tempting delicacies in 
the way of green vegetables that the buyer with a limited 
purse should pass by. A cucumber at fifty cents or even at 
ten cents is not a sensible purchase. Lettuce, grown under 
glass, at ten cents a head is not an extravagance, if the in- 
come allows thirty-five to forty cents per capita per day for 
food. As a rule, select the less expensive vegetable, provided 
it is in good condition. The prices are so fluctuating that a 
definite statement is impossible. (See Chapter XVII.) 

Root vegetables should be uniform in size, sound, the skins fair. 

Head vegetables should be solid, with but few waste leaves on 
'the outside. 

Vegetables with hard rind should be sound and firm. 

Asparagus should be even in size, the stalks not bitten by insects. 

Cauliflower should be firm and white, not affected by insects 
or blight. 

Celery should be firm and white, free from blemishes, fine in 
texture. 

Peas should have crisp pods well filled, but not too full. 

String beans should be crisp and snap easily. 

All leaf vegetables should be crisp — not wilted. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Uncooked vegetables. — Crisp vegetables with tender fiber are 
eaten raw. Their preparation includes freshening in cold water, 
thorough washing to remove grit and insects, thorough drying by 
shaking in a soft cloth or wire basket, and cooling on the ice. Let- 
tuce should not be served so wet that the water collects on the plate, 
making it impossible to dress the salad with oil. See salad making, 
Chapter XV. 

Cooked vegetables. — Vegetable cooking is an art much neg- 
lected, and in consequence vegetables are sometimes served lacking 
their proper flavor and their original nutrients. To cook vege- 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 115 

tables in boiling salted water, throwing the water away, is not the 
correct method, except in a few cases. With this method much of 
the valuable mineral matter and the flavoring substances are lost 
in the water. With such strong flavored, vegetables as the cabbage, 
old onions and beets, and old potatoes this method is permissible, 
but even in these cases the nutritive value is decreased. 

Principles of cooking. — Softening of the fiber. 

Opening of the starch granules, when starch is present, at a tem- 
perature of 212° F. Retaining mineral and flavoring matters. 

Cooking processes. — These rank in value as they do or do not 
retain the mineral and flavoring matters. 

Baking. — No nutritive material lost. The best method for 
potatoes and sweet potatoes. Used also for squash, pumpkin, 
beets, young onions, dried beans, peas, and lentils. 

Steaming. (Cooking in a steamer.) — No nutritive material lost. 
A good method for all fresh vegetables. Steamed vegetables have 
less flavor than baked. 

Stewing. — Cooking in a stew pan or kettle with so little water 
that it is almost boiled out at the end of the process, any remaining 
liquid being served with the vegetable. The best method for 
spinach, which can be cooked with no additional water, beyond that 
remaining on the leaves from the washing. The French use this 
method almost entirely, and with tender peas and carrots they omit 
water and use butter only. A substitute for this latter is a very 
small amount of water, with the addition of butterine or some good 
butter substitute. 

Boiling. — Cooking in a large amount of boiling, salted water, 
the water to be drained off and thrown away. May be used with 
old beets of rank flavor, strong onions, old potatoes, or potatoes 
boiled with the skins on. A wasteful method. 

Adjuncts. — Salt, pepper, butter, or some other fat, milk, cheese, 
bread crumbs, parsley, eggs. 

Utensils. — A vegetable brush, a sharp knife, a chopper, a po- 
tato masher, a strainer, a colander, a stew pan, kettle or steamer, 
baking pan, baking dish, bean pot, frying pan or kettle. 

General directions. — Wash the vegetables, scrubbing the skin 
vegetables with a brush. Washing in several waters is important 
with spinach to remove all grit. Scrape off thin skins or pare off 
the thicker. Thick skins such as those of old beets are more easily 



116 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

removed after cooking. The outer covering must be removed in the 
case of peas, shell beans, and sweet corn. Pull or cut strings from 
string beans with great care. Discard all poor portions. Remove and 
throw away the inner pulp and seeds of old squashes and pumpkins. 
The whole of a tender summer squash is eatable. 

When boiling salted water is used, allow one tablespoonful of 
salt to four quarts of water. Steamed and stewed vegetables are 
salted and dressed with butter or butter substitute before serving. 
Butter is a better dressing for vegetables than white sauce. Where 
cream is available, nothing is so delicious. Use white sauce very spar- 
ingly with some esealloped vegetable for variety. Making a sauce 
adds to the labor of i preparation, and the sauce hides the delicious 
flavor of a well-cooked vegetable. Some vegetables are mashed 
before serving ; potatoes, turnip, squash, either boiled or baked. 

Time of cooking. — The following table is a guide, but one must 
learn from practice, for the time depends upon the quality of the 
vegetable, whether tender or tough, and upon the size whether large 
or small. Test by gently inserting a fork. 

Allow more time for cooking in a steamer, than for stewing or 
boiling. It requires more time to bake a potato than to boil one of 
the same size. Why? 

Time-table 

(For stewing and boiling unless stated otherwise.) 

Fifteen minutes. — Tender cabbage and sweet corn. These are 
usually cooked too long. 

Thirty minutes. — Asparagus ; peas ; potatoes of medium size ; 
summer squash ; tomatoes. 

Forty-five minutes. — Young beets and carrots ; onions ; young 
parsnips ; medium potatoes baked, sweet potatoes boiled. 

One hour. — String and shelled beans ; cauliflower ; oyster plant ; 
winter squash, steamed or baked ; young turnips. 

Two hours. — Old carrots, beets, and turnips. 

Six to eight hours (or more). — Dried beans, lentils, and peas, 
baked in the oven, with water added. 

The potato, a starchy vegetable. — Make it your pride to serve 
a plain potato, mealy and inviting. Potatoes are " new," fully 
ripe, and old. The new potato is in market in July and August, 
and may be recognized by its very thin skin. The later potatoes 
have a thicker skin, the color still being fresh. In the spring after 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 117 

its winter storage, the potato is " old." It seems a little less firm, 
the color of the exterior is somewhat changed ; perhaps the buds in 
the eyes of the potato are beginning to grow. When cooked it has 
a stronger flavor, and rather darker color. If the potato has been 
frozen, a sweet flavor is developed, and the quality is waxy. Po- 
tatoes are sometimes inferior in quality when the season is a poor 
one, or when some potato disease is prevalent. The following classi- 
fication shows you in how many ways potatoes may be cooked, and 
also shows you how easy it is to classify recipes in an orderly way. 

I. Potatoes cooked whole. 

1. Steamed. 

a. With skin. 

b. Without skin. 

2. Boiled. 

a. With skin. 

b. Without skin. 

3. Baked. 

a. With skin. 
6. Without skin. 
II. Potatoes, not whole. 
1. From raw potatoes. 

a. Sliced and escalloped. 
6. Cut in cubes and stewed. 

c. Cut in shoes or fancy shapes and fried. 
' 2. From cooked potatoes. 

a. Mashed. 

(a) From boiled potatoes, plain or browned on top. 
(6) From baked potatoes, seasoned and served in shell. 

b. Creamed. From either cold boiled or baked potatoes ; 

the latter are better. 

c. SautS. 

(a) Sliced and browned. 
(6) Hashed and browned. 
If you know some other method, see if you can fit it into this 
grouping. 

i. Baked potatoes. 

Method 1. The best method, for new potatoes. Select those 
of uniform size. When scrubbed, place them in a shallow 



118 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

pan, or upon the rack of the oven. The oven should be hot, 
about 450° F. or even a higher temperature. (See oven tests, 
Chapter IX.) The length of time required depends upon the 
size of the potato, forty-five minutes being the average time. 

A potato is largely water. What is the temperature of the 
interior of the potato during the baking process? 

Test by pressing firmly, protecting the fingers by a soft cloth ; 
or insert a fork. When the potato is done, it yields to the 
pressure of the fingers. If the potatoes cannot be served at 
once, break the skin that the steam may escape, cover with a 
cloth, and keep them hot. 

For convenience at the table, cut the potatoes in two length- 
wise, loosen the content of each half with a fork, sprinkle with salt, 
and add a bit of butter, as much as one would add at the table. 

Potato on the half shell carries serving one step farther. 
Cut the baked potatoes in two lengthwise, remove the con- 
tents, mash lightly, add butter or butterine, milk, and salt, al- 
lowing a teaspoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of milk and a 
shake or two of salt to each potato. These measurements can- 
not be given with exactness , because potatoes vary in size. Beat 
this mixture well, replace lightly in each half shell, and brown 
the tops slightly. This is nothing more than mashed baked 
potato, prettily served. 

Invent other variations of this dish, adding ingredients that 
are agreeable when mixed with the potato. The beaten white 
of an egg added, gives greater lightness to the mixture in the 
potato shell. 

Method 2. The same as Method 1, except that the potatoes 
are pared before baking. A good method when the skins are 
not fair. A brown crust is formed on the potato, which is 
crisp and pleasant to eat. Large potatoes may be cut in two 
before baking, or even sliced. 

What difference in length of baking will there be between 
Methods 1 and 2 ? 

2. Boiled potatoes. 

The only way to prevent the loss of nutrients in using this 
process is to boil the potatoes with the " jackets " on. This 
is the best way with new potatoes. This method with ripe 
and old potatoes gives a yellowish color to the surface and 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 119 

indeed throughout. It is a labor-saving method for the busy 
housewife, as the skin cracks and loosens at the end of the 
boiling process, and is easily removed. 

If you choose to have a snow-white potato, it must be pared 
before boiling, and thus you deliberately waste the valuable 
mineral matter provided by nature. If your income permits 
this aesthetic pleasure, the mineral matter can of course be 
supplied in other vegetables. The woman who can spend but 
twenty to thirty cents per capita for food per day should boil 
the potatoes with the skins on and gratify her artistic sense in 
some other way. 

The method of boiling is the same in either case, whether the 
potato is pared or not. 

Have enough boiling water to cover the potatoes. Put the 
potatoes of uniform size one at a time into the kettle that 
the boiling may not stop. Allow a gentle boiling to continue 
until the potatoes are done. Why avoid rapid boiling ? Test 
with a fork at the end of half an hour. When the potatoes 
are mellow, drain off the water, and set the kettle where the 
remaining moisture will steam off. Shake gently to hasten 
this process, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt. If they must 
stand before serving will you place a tin cover or a cloth over 
the kettle ? Old potatoes, with a strong flavor, should be pared 
before boiling, or even soaked in cold water. 

Mashed potatoes. — Some one devised this convenient method of 
serving, to save trouble at the table. Mashed potato can be 
very poor and unappetizing when wet and lumpy. Do not at- 
tempt it with new, poor, or old potatoes. See that the boiled 
potatoes are as dry as can be — every particle of water steamed 
away. Mash thoroughly with the wire masher, add butter or 
butterine, salt and milk in about the proportions given for potato 
in the half shell. Use a tablespoonful or so of cream if it is avail- 
able. Beat vigorously. The mealiness of the potato and the 
vigorous beating are the secrets of success. The finished product 
should be light and somewhat moist, — not wet. Reheat in the 
kettle. Pile lightly in a hot dish and serve ; or brown the top 
before serving. 

Potato puff. (Souffle.) — With your knowledge of mashed 
potato, can you not invent a potato puff ? 



120 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

4. Escalloped potato. — The name escalloped is applied to any 

baked dish that is arranged in layers. Escalloped potato 
is a palatable dish and this is one of the most economical of 
methods. 

Wash, pare, and slice the potatoes in J-inch pieces. Slightly 
grease an earthen or enameled baking dish. Cover the bottom 
of the dish with a layer of the slices, sprinkle the slices lightly 
with flour, and put on two teaspoonfuls of butter, or butterine, 
in small bits. Continue until the dish is nearly full. Pour 
in milk to barely cover the potatoes, put a cover on the dish 
and set the dish in an oven of 380° F. Remove the cover in 
time to allow the top to brown. Allow rather more than half 
an hour for the baking. 

5. Creamed potatoes. — Method 1, an easy way. Chop cold -baked 

potatoes with the chopper. Allow one tablespoonful of butter 
to 1 pint of chopped potato. Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
Stir in the potatoes. Shake from the dredger the equiva- 
lent of a tablespoonful of flour, stirring the potato with one 
hand as you shake with the other. Pour in enough milk to 
barely cover the chopped potato. Set the saucepan in the 
coolest spot on the range ; or on the simmering burner of a gas 
range, upon an asbestos mat ; or turn all into an earthen- 
ware jar, or baking dish, and proceed as with escalloped potato. 
Allow the mixture to cook until it becomes creamy. 

Method 2. Cut the cold potatoes in cubes, and heat in a 
thin white sauce. See Chapter X. 

Boiled potatoes may be used, but baked are better in tex- 
ture and flavor for creaming. 

6. French fried potatoes. — Wash and pare small potatoes, cut in 

eighths lengthwise, and soak a few minutes in cold water. 
Take from water, dry between towels, and fry in deep fat. 
Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt. 

(1) Deep fat frying. — An iron kettle is the best for deep 
fat, 3 quarts a convenient, size. A wire basket is almost neces- 
sary for frying soft material. 

Fill the kettle | full of fat and place over fire. When a 
slight blue smoke or vapor rises from it, it is ready to test. 
Test with small cubes of bread. If bread browns in 1 minute, 
the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures. If it browns 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 121 

in 10 seconds, it is right for cooked materials. Care must be 
taken to keep the temperatures at the right point, for if too cool, 
the material will soak fat ; if too hot, both fat and material to 
be cooked will burn. 

(2) To clarify fat. — Drop several slices raw, pared potato 
into the fat and let bubble up. Strain all through cheesecloth 
back into pail from which fat was taken. The potatoes seem 
to absorb food odors and collect crumbs and leave the fat 
clear. 

7. Stewed celery. — A green vegetable. Stalks of celery, too 

tough or coarse for serving uncooked, are delicious when 
stewed. The process is simple. Wash, scrape, and cut the 
stalks crosswise. Place them in a stewpan, barely cover with 
hot water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of celery. 
Cook gently for half an hour or until the celery is tender. Use 
the liquid remaining in making a sauce, • adding some milk 
to make the necessary amount of liquid. Three fourths of a cup 
of sauce is enough for a pint of celery. See Chapter X. % 

8. Cabbage. — The method given makes cabbage a delicious and 

attractive vegetable, as delicate as cauliflower, and the odor 
in the kitchen is not noticeable. 

Select a small cabbage, with the ribs in the leaves not too 
thick. Prepare the cabbage before washing it by cutting out 
the stalks from below with a sharp knife. Separate the leaves. 
Have ready the largest kettle available, nearly full of rapidly 
boiling water. Drop in one cabbage leaf at a time, pressing 
each one down with a long-handled spoon or skimmer. Do 
this so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. Leave the 
kettle uncovered, and allow the cabbage to cook from 12 to 
15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the leaf stalks. 
Remove the leaves with a long-handled skimmer, putting them 
into a colander standing on a plate. Immediately pour the hot 
water down the sink drain, turn on the cold water to flush 
away the odor, and fill the kettle with cold water. While 
the cabbage is cooking, you have made a pint of white sauce, 
No. 2 (Ch. X), adding a teaspoonful of salt, and have prepared 
§ cup of buttered crumbs. Cut the cabbage leaves slightly, 
place them in a baking dish, pour the white sauce over them, 
sprinkle the crumbs on the top, and brown the crumbs in the 



122 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

oven or under the gas. If you can, prepare this as a surprise 
at home, and ask the family to " guess " what it is. If the 
cabbage is a good one, some of the leaves turn a very pretty 
green with this method of boiling. 
9. Baked beans. — A nitrogenous vegetable and a meat substi- 
tute. A dish known in old days in New England, baked 
to perfection in the old brick oven. Baked beans seem diffi- 
cult of digestion for some people. The mustard is supposed 
to be helpful, and adds something to the flavor. If the mo- 
lasses is omitted, or but a small amount used, and if butter 
takes the place of pork or suet, the beans seem more digestible. 
In different parts of New England the dish is varied. Some 
pebple prefer rather dry baked beans, others wish them moist 
and very sweet. 

Utensils. — A kettle. A covered bean pot. 
Ingredients. — 1 quart of white beans. 
1 teaspoonful of soda, 
i lb. salt pork or more, or 
4 tablespoonfuls of beef fat or butter sub- 
stitute. 
Molasses, from two tablespoonfuls to J cup, 
or none. 
j 1 teaspoonful of mustard. 

Method. — Wash, and soak the beans in cold water over 
night. Pour off any water that remains. Put the beans into 
the kettle, cover with cold water, add the soda, and cook gently 
until the beans are slightly softened. The soda aids the soften- 
ing. Pour off the water again, and put the beans into the 
pot. Mix the molasses and mustard with a pint of water, and 
pour this over the beans, adding more water if the beans are 
not covered. Place the pork or other fat upon the beans, and 
cover the pot. If fat other than pork is used, salt must be 
added to the beans. The beans should bake slowly, for from 
6 to 8 hours, and even longer in a very slow oven. - A stove 
of the type shown in Fig. 17 is good for this purpose. They 



Laboratory management. — The last experiment is the only one not easily 
performed in the school kitchen. The process can begin perhaps on one day, 
and be finished the next. If there is some apparatus that cooks at a low 
temperature, the practical difficulties may be overcome. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 123 

can be baked in the ordinary gas oven, if only one burner is 
used, and that is turned very low. 

Vegetable, or " cream " soups. 

These are of two classes: the purees (porridge), or thick soups, 
with vegetable pulp as the thickening material, and the cream 
soups, which are somewhat thinner, the juices of some vegetable 
giving the flavor. 

Potato puree, or soup, is an example of the first ; cream of 
tomato of the second. The line is not sharply drawn between the 
two in many cook books. Milk is an important ingredient in these 
soups, so that they are sometimes known as milk soups. Butter and 
flour are used in both, — the flour in the puree " binds " the 
mixture and makes it smoother ; in the cream soup the flour is 
used for thickening as well. 

Dried beans, peas, or lentils make a delicious puree, the secret of 
success being long slow cooking in some low temperature appa- 
ratus. They are brought to perfection in the Atkinson Cooker. 

10. Potato Puree. 

Ingredients. 

Potato 1 cup 

Milk 1 quart 

Flour 1 tablespoonful 

Butter 1 tablespoonful 

Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 
Celery stalks, cut small 1 teaspoonful 

Onion, chopped 1 tablespoonful 

Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks. — If a thicker puree is desired, use more of the 
mashed potato. If celery salt is used, omit one teaspoonful 
of the salt. Less onion may be used, and the pepper omitted. 
Utensils. — Make the list yourself, after reading the direc- 
tions for mixing. 

Method of mixing. — Boil and mash the potato, or use cold 
mashed potato. Heat the milk in the double boiler with the 
celery and onion. Add the milk gradually to the mashed po- 
tato, beating vigorously. 

Put this mixture through a strainer into the double boiler, 



124 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and reheat it. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, or stir in 
the flour, add slowly half a cup of the soup to the butter and 
flour paste, and then pour this slowly into the mixture in the 
double boiler, stirring all the time. The soup will be ready to 
serve in about ten minutes. 

The important point in this recipe is the quality of the ' 
mashed potato. It should be dry and light. It may be made 
from hot, mealy baked potatoes. If cold mashed potato is 
used, this should be made light again with a fork. An excel- 
lent luncheon dish. Will serve four to six people. 

ii. Cream of tomato soup. 

Ingredients. 

Tomato juice i cup 

Milk 1 quart 

Flour 2 tablespoonfuls 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 

Bicarbonate of soda J teaspoonful 

Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks. — Celery and onion may be added, but are not 
necessary. When you become expert, you will be able to 
use a larger amount of tomato juice, and even omit the soda. 

Method of mixing. — This you will be able to work out for 
yourself. First perform this simple experiment. Stir together 
a tablespoonful of stewed tomato and a tablespoonful of milk. 
What happens? Heat this mixture. What further do you 
notice ? How may you best extract the juice from the tomato ? 
You have noticed the effect of the acid tomato upon the 
milk. The soda is added to partly counteract this effect. 
Will you stir the soda into the tomato juice or into the milk ? 
Will you stir the tomato juice into the milk, or the milk into 
the tomato juice? Will you cook the mixture at all? How 
long before serving will you mix the two? When will you 
add the butter and flour? 



Laboratory management. — An individual portion of soup may be made 
with i cup of liquid, but it is better to allow 1 cup when possible to each 
pupil, or two pupils may work together. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 125 

The important point in this soup is to prevent the curdling, 
so you safeguard the milk at each step. 

Croutons may be served with any of these soups.

CHAPTER VIII 

CEREAL PRODUCTS 

The common grains, sometimes called cereals, 1 yield some 
of the most important of all the food materials. Those most 
widely used are wheat, maize, or Indian corn, oats, rice, 
barley, rye, and millet. In this country wheat and corn are 
the two great crops upon which our prosperity largely de- 
pends, and a shortage in one of these crops is felt in the busi- 
ness world, not only in this country, but abroad. Rice is 
the important cereal in China, Japan, and India, and a 
failure of the rice crop may mean famine to millions of people, 
especially in India. These facts are mentioned to show that 
the race has learned to depend upon the grains as a staple 
food, and a study of their composition proves that this 
common habit is founded in reason. The grains are all 
members of the grass family, and the edible portion is the 
seed. From these seeds are manufactured pure starch, 
breakfast cereals, meal, and flour. Like beans and pSas, 
these seeds are the storehouses of food for the young plants, 
and we therefore find the high nutritive value depicted in 
Fig. 37. Notice that the carbohydrate (starch) content is 
high in all; that all contain protein, oats, wheat, and rye 
being about equal in this and higher than the others ; oats 
are highest in fat, corn ranking next. The ash contains the 
same important mineral substances that we found in the 
fruits, the percentages of each differing somewhat with the 

1 "Cereal" is derived from the Latin word "cerealis,'' pertaining to Ceres, 
the Roman goddess of agriculture.

different grains and being quite different for the cereals as a 
class than for the fruits and vegetables as a class. It must 
be remembered that these percentages are given for the 
whole grain, and that the amounts of the nutrients in the 
manufactured product depend upon the process employed. 

Manufacture of cereal food materials. 1 — The primitive 
method of making the material in the grain available for use 
was by grinding the grain between two -stones, or by pound- 
ing one stone upon another, and this method is used by the 
Mexicans and certain of the American Indians to this day, 
human muscle being the power employed. Wind and water 
were harnessed for grinding grain, and were the only motive 
powers available until the invention of steam, the grinding 
being done by stones. In a Connecticut town there still 
exists a mill stone, one of a pair so small that they were 
carried into the settlement on horseback, and when placed in 
a small mill by a brook, they ground a bushel of corn in a day. 

Breakfast cereals and meal are now made in the great 
factories that produce flour ; steam is the motive power and 
the grains are broken, or rolled, between steel rollers. (See 
Chapter XII.) 

Breakfast cereals. — The ready-to-eat breakfast cereal 
has met the popular demand for a quickly prepared food for 
the first meal of the day. A few of these are made under 
known conditions, but they are sometimes manufactured 
from inferior grain, and the presence of grit at times indi- 
cates a possible lack of cleanliness in the process. It is a 
question, too, whether or not the starch has been subjected 
to heat for a sufficient length of time, and whether they can 
be masticated sufficiently to make the grain digestible, 
and the nutritive material available. Their use for young 
children is undesirable. For older people, they add variety 

1 The manufacture of flour is discussed in the chapter on bread making. 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 129 

to the diet, but they are usually more expensive than the 
home-cooked breakfast foods, even when the cost of fuel is 
taken into account. See Fig. 38. 

Cooked breakfast cereals. — It is an easy task to cook a 
cereal, especially now that the tireless cooker in some form 
is present in so many homes. The cereal for breakfast does 
not necessitate early rising ; as it may be prepared the day or 
evening before and be served in palatable form in the morning. 

The most common breakfast cereals are made from oais^ 
wheat , and corn^-^varying in fineness of grain from those 
ground like a meal to the coarser cracked wheat and the 
samp made from corn. It is well to use kinds made from 
different grains, but when the worth of a few has been proved, 
it is not wise to try another kind simply because it has a new 
label. One manufacturer confessed to a visitor that the 
same cereal was put into boxes of different colors and sold 
under different names as a means of inviting purchasers. 
The cereal foods made from whole grains are especially 
valuable on account of the high mineral, content. 

It usually pays to buy in boxes, rather than in bulk, in 
the case of cereals; and always from a reliable grocer. If 
you purchase a box of cereal as a " bargain," weigh its con- 
tents and compare the weight with the weight of a box 
bought in the regular way. Also examine such a box for 
the presence of insects. These may be recognized some- 
times by a webby substance, and again the insects themselves 
may be detected. Do not buy too large a stock of cereals, 
since they are better when they are fresh from the factory, 
and a good firm renews its stock often. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. — 1. Softening of the fiber by long-con- 
tinued low temperature with a supply of water present.

2. Complete opening of the starch granules by the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

3. The protein present presents no special problem. Its diges- 
tibility is not especially affected, but the softening of the fiber of 
the cereal makes the protein available to us. 

Methods. — There are two classes into which the cereals may be 
divided, — the flaked and the granular. The weighing experi- 
ments (page 62) show that the granular is the heavier. This means 
that more water will be absorbed by a given measure of the granular, 
because it contains more material. 

In experimenting with a cereal at home it is well to try the 
proportion of water and cereal printed on the box the first time, 
altering the proportion if the first result is not satisfactory. There 
should be enough water to soften the cereal, and only just enough. 
If the cooked cereal is stiff, the measure of water is short ; if so 
thin that the cereal runs on the plate, too much water was allowed. 

i. Preparation of breakfast cereal. 

Ingredients. 

1 part, by measure, flaked cereal to 2 of water. 

1 part granular cereal to 3 to 4 of water. 

1 cup of dry cereal will serve three or four people. 

Samp, cracked wheat, and coarse corn meal will take from 

4 to 6 parts of water. 
Salt. A tablespoonful to a quart of water is an average 
amount. 

Utensils : a measuring cup ; a double boiler ; a fork. 

Method. — Measure the cereal and water, put the water into the 
inner part of the double boiler with the salt. Have the 
lower part of the boiler ready — about half full of hot water ; 
place the inner boiler directly upon the stove or over the flame. 
When the water is boiling rapidly, shake thecereal into the water 
from a cup, so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. This 
is the first secret of a well-eooked cereal. The rapidly boiling 
water keeps the grains of cereal in motion, and thus they do 
not stick to the vessel nor to each other, and the heat reaches 
the starch in the grains equally. If the grains begin to settle, 
shake the vessel gently, but do not stir, even with a fork. 
Allow this process to continue for about five minutes, or until 
you see a thickening of the mass, so much so that the separate 



132 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

grains do not settle. If toward the end of this stage there is 
danger of sticking, lift the mass with the fork, but do not stir 
it, as this motion will break the grains. This first process 
opens the starch grains. Place the inner part of the boiler 
in the outer over boiling water and allow the cooking to con- 
tinue for at least one hour. For this is the second secret of the 
perfect cereal, — a long-continued process that softens the 
fiber and develops flavor. One cereal, advertised as being 
cooked in three minutes, remains unpalatable after that length 
of time, but is delicious at the end of two hours. If you have a 
fireless cooker, put the cereal in the double boiler into the 
cooker overnight for the second stage. Any low temperature 
apparatus gives the desired result. 

2. The uses of cold cereal. — Never throw away cooked cereals. 

The cold cereal is useful in many ways. 

(a) Mold in small cups with dates or other fruit, and serve 
with sugar and cream for luncheon. 

(b) Cool corn meal mush in a flat dish, cut it in slices when 
cold, and brown the slices in a frying pan, with beef fat, or 
a butter substitute. Serve with sugar, molasses, or sirup for 
breakfast or luncheon. 

(c) Rice or hominy may be mixed with a beaten egg, molded 
into small cakes, and browned either in the frying pan, or 
in the oven. 

(d) A small remaining portion of any cereal may be used to 
thicken soup. 

(e) Any cooked cereal may be used in muffins or even yeast 
bread. (See those chapters.) 

3. Corn meal "mush." — This is cooked by the same method as 

the other cereals, except that the amount of water is larger 
and the first boiling should continue longer. The meal must 
be scattered slowly into the boiling water, or else be mixed 
first with cold water, as it lumps very easily. The second stage 
of the process should continue several hours. 

Rice. — Rice varies very much in quality and in the shape 
of the grain. Louisiana and Chinese rice are among those 
that have a firm and large grain keeping its shape well when 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 133 

cooked. Inferior varieties become too soft, and the finished 
product is pasty and poor in color and flavor. Much is said 
at present about the harmful effect of the polishing process 
upon the quality of the rice. An unpolished rice may some- 
times be found on the market, brownish in color and with a 
good flavor. 

4. Boiled rice. — Rice may be cooked in the double boiler by the 
same method as other cereals, allowing 1 part of rice to 3 of 
water. The rice should be well washed in cold water. 

The second stage need not be continued so long, from three 
quarters of an hour to an hour being sufficient. The flavor is 
improved by the use of milk in place of half of the water. By 
this method the nutritive value is much increased. 

Another method used by the Chinese continues the boiling 
throughout the whole process. A very large amount of water 
is used, several quarts for one cup of rice, and when the water 
is boiling violently the rice is scattered in very slowly. The 
boiling continues from twenty minutes to half an hour, or until 
the grains are tender, and then the water is drained off, through 
a colander. The rice in the colander should then be placed 
where the remaining moisture will steam off. By this method 
nutrients are lost, but the grains of the rice stand out dis- 
tinctly and are light and dry. It is a difficult method for the 
novice, because its success depends upon the removal of the 
rice from the water just at the moment it is tender, but not too 
soft. The grains should be tested in twenty minutes. 

Corn products. — Corn being our most abundant grain, it 
is the cheapest, and we should promote its use. Hominy 
and samp and Indian meal, when well cooked, are all most 
palatable. There is a difference between old and new pro- 
cess corn meal, to be noticed in the flavor and in the behavior 
of the two kinds in cooking. The new process meal now more 
largely on the market has been deprived of the germ, which 
contains a large amount of oil, and although the meal does 
not deteriorate so soon, there is some loss of flavor. More- 



134 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over, when the new process meal is used in an old-time 
recipe, more wetting must be used than the recipe calls for 
and a larger amount of fat. 

The old process of grinding between stones is still employed 
in some localities. Southern and Rhode Island corn meal 
are ground in this way, and may be found at some groceries. 
There are also two colors, the yellow and the white, each with 
a distinctive flavor, and some people who think they dislike 
corn meal find the white meal agreeable. 

Pure starches. — These occur as food materials in several 
forms. Cornstarch is the starchy portion only removed 
from the grain of corn. Wheat starch is more largely used 
for laundry purposes than for food. Rice flour may be 
treated as starch in cooking. Arrowroot is a fine starch 
from the roots of a family of plants growing in the West 
Indies and other warm climates. It is used principally in 
cooking for invalids. Cassava, manioca, tapioca, and sago 
are starchy materials in granular form. The first three are 
made from the pith of the cassava plant, the sago from the 
sago palm. The pure starches are all easily digested and 
inexpensive. Corn starch is the most abundant and cheap- 
est pure starch in this country. 

The starch granule. — To understand the behavior of 
materials like cornstarch, rice flour, and arrowroot in cook- 
ing, we need to know more of the starch grain. Cornstarch 
is composed of myriads of tiny granules somewhat like those 
pictured in Fig. 39, but smaller. The starch granules of dif- 
ferent plants differ in size and even in shape, but they all 
have a covering lying in folds, the pure starch being within. 
The granule unfolds or bursts when exposed to heat. When 
these granules are floating in water, and, being heated, open 
at the same moment, the starch paste is smooth ; otherwise, 
the starch lumps.

A. Starch experiments. 

Starch turns a characteristic blue color in the presence of iodine. 
This is an unfailing starch test, but must be used in the cold. 

1. Grate a piece of potato into a small amount of water, and 
strain out the pulp. The starch settles from the water in a few 
minutes. Pour off the water, and add a drop of diluted iodine to 
the remaining starch. If a microscope is available, dilute this 
mixture and with a dropper tube place a drop upon a slide. The 




Farmers' Bulletin No. 295, V. S. Dept. Agriculture. 

Fig. 39. — Changes of starch cells in cooking : a, cells of a raw potato with 
starch grains in natural condition ; 6, cells of a partially cooked potato ; 
c, cells of a thoroughly boiled potato. 

potato starch granules are comparatively large and easy to see 
through the microscope. 

2. Drop a teaspoonful of dry starch into boiling water. 

3. Mix a teaspoonful of starch with a small quantity of cold 
water, and stir this into boiling water. 

4. Mix a teaspoonful of starch with \ cup of cold water, and 
bring the water to the boiling point, stirring the mixture as it heats. 

Why are 3 and 4 similar in result, and different from 2? 



Desserts from the starches. — ■ Cornstarch, in particular, is 
often disliked, because it is undercooked, and too large a 
proportion is used. It may be made very palatable, and is 
too valuable in cooking and too inexpensive to be discarded.

5. Chocolate cornstarch. 

Milk 1 pint 

Cornstarch 3 tablespoonfuls, level 

Cocoa (Baker's) 3 tablespoonfuls, level 

Sugar i cup 

Salt J teaspoonful 

Vanilla 1 teas'poonful 

What utensils? You should be able to plan the method of 
mixing. The milk must be heated in a double boiler. Which 
method of mixing in the cornstarch will you use ? How can 
you best add the cocoa, sugar, and salt ? The vanilla ? 

It is difficult to boil milk directly over the fire or flame, 
without scorching it. Since the starch cannot well be exposed 
to the boiling temperature in this case, the process must con- 
tinue in the double boiler until the mixture has thickened well, 
for at least half an hour, three quarters being better. When 
the cooking is finished, pour the mixture into molds which have 
been wet in cold water. When the mixture is cooled, chill it 
in the refrigerator. Serve with cream or milk and sugar for 
those who may want it sweeter. This gives a soft mold, that 
is much more palatable than one so stiff that it has a firm shape. 
This will serve four or five people. 

6. Tapioca and sago. — These materials make delicious desserts 

with fruit. They are also used with eggs and milk. (See 
Chapter XV.) 

Macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli are valuable cereal 
products made from flour, this form of cereal food having 
originated in Italy. The Italians manufacture the paste- in 
a large variety of forms, and some of the small fancy shapes 
are also used in soup. The composition of macaroni is shown 
in Fig. 51. It is a valuable material, and when served or 
cooked with cheese may well be the main dish of a home 
luncheon.

Method. — Cook macaroni in boihng salted water twenty 
minutes or until soft, drain in a strainer, pour cold water over 
it to remove stickiness. Add cream and reheat. A thin 
white sauce may be used in place of the cream. 

8. Macaroni baked with cheese. — Cover the bottom of a baking 

dish with plain boiled macaroni. Sprinkle with grated 
cheese. Add another layer of macaroni and another of cheese. 
Repeat until the dish is full. Pour a thin sauce over this, 
almost filling the dish. Cover with buttered crumbs and 
bake in hot oven until crumbs are brown. Some prefer to 
omit the crumbs and have a thick layer of the cheese on top 
which becomes crisp and brown. Boiled macaroni and spa- 
ghetti may be served with tomato sauce and a little grated cheese 
This is called " Italian style."

CHAPTER IX 

EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 

Eggs are a specially interesting food because they contain 
all the elements necessary to the development of the young 
chick within the shell. The structure of the egg is familiar, 
with its division into the yolk and white, and it is interesting 
to note the details of this structure. 

Break a fresh egg carefully into a saucer. The shell is 
porous, allowing water to evaporate from the egg and air 
to enter. To this porosity is due the fact that other sub- 
stances may enter the egg, giving it an unnatural flavor and 
even hastening its deterioration. Within the shell is a fine 
membrane which protects the white. The yolk is also di- 
vided from the white by a more delicate membrane which 
enables one to separate the yolk from the white of a fresh 
egg. A careful examination reveals at each end of the yolk 
a continuation of this membrane in the form of small cords 
which are fastened at each end of the shell, holding the yolk 
evenly suspended in the center of the shell. Rough handling 
or jolting breaks this membrane, and the yolk drops to one 
side. 

Lift the white carefully with a fork, and notice its elas- 
ticity. This cohesive property makes it possible to beat air 
into the white until the whole mass become porous. The 
yolk is creamy rather than light when beaten, and a bit of 
the yolk mixed with the white prevents the latter from be- 
coming light and dry.

140 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Composition of the egg. — ■ Figure 40 gives the composition 
of the yolk and white taken together, and of the yolk and 
white separated. The protein content is high, and the fat 
content as well, the yolk containing a higher percentage of 
these two foodstuffs than the white. The mineral matter is 
of high value, iron and phosphorus being found in ideal 
forms in the yolk. In using the egg as food we are availing 
ourselves of one of nature's richest storehouses. A single 
egg of average size yields about 75 calories, of which 60 come 
from the yolk and 15 from the white. A very large egg, 
weighing two and two thirds ounces, will yield 100 calories. 

Fresh eggs and cold storage eggs. — The fresh-laid egg is 
always desired for its delicious flavor, and this flavor changes 
but little in a week or two if the egg is kept cool. It is de- 
sirable to preserve eggs, however, for future use at the season 
when they are most abundant and cheap. Many methods 
have been tried, such as laying them away in sawdust, sink- 
ing them in water-glass solution, or coating the shell with 
paraffin or some other substance to prevent evaporation and 
the entrance of air. The introduction of cold storage on a 
large scale promises a solution of the problem. If eggs are 
fresh when placed in storage, it is possible to keep them 
just above the freezing temperature for months without 
appreciable deterioration. 

Eggs too long in storage may be detected by the musty 
odor and flavor, the running of the yolk into the white, and 
the thin quality of the white which prevents beating stiff. 
Some states have already passed stringent laws in regard to 
the sale of cold storage eggs. 

The cost of eggs and how to buy. — The demand for fresh 
eggs is great, and so many eggs are exported, that the price is 
high, even in the summer. Twenty-five cents a dozen is a 
reasonable price, but this is below the average at the present 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 141 

date. The thirty-five or forty-cent daily allowance for food 
will permit the moderate use of eggs at thirty-five cents a 
dozen, but not a liberal use in cakes and desserts. They 
should be used at such a price and with that allowance as 
the main dish for breakfast or luncheon at times, and not 
in sweet dishes calling for three or four eggs. If a recipe 
for soft custard calls for three eggs to a pint of milk, leave 
out one egg or even two, and use one or two tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch instead. Select eggs with a hard shell, and 
yolk of rich yellow. If the shell is soft and the yolk pale, 
these deficiences should be reported, as they can be corrected 
by the poultryman. The difference in color of the shells, 
whether white or brown, is not of great consequence. If you 
can buy eggs by the crate direct from the poultryman, this 
is a saving, provided the eggs can be used before they de- 
teriorate. A small crate holds fifteen dozen ; the usual size 
thirty dozen. Some express companies have a special rate 
for eggs, and parcel post should aid in this method of buying. 
Relative digestibility of soft and hard cooked eggs. — The 
fact must be recalled that to digest is to dissolve, and that 
the digestion of food means a dissolving by the digestive 
juices, aided by water. When we speak of the digestibility 
of food we may mean the ease and comfort of digestion, or 
the length of time taken by the process, or the completeness 
of the process. If we take the third of these meanings, hard- 
cooked egg is as digestible as the soft-cooked or the raw egg, 
because it is completely dissolved in digestion in the course 
of time. If the second meaning of digestion is taken, the 
hard-cooked egg may be slightly less digestible, for a slightly 
longer time is consumed in the process. The latest researches, 
however, show that the digestive process is longer with any 
food than was formerly supposed, and the difference in this 
case is not especially important. Indeed, we must accept 



142 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the conclusions of the scientist and frankly admit that the 
differences of temperature in cooking of egg do not have any 
great effect upon its digestibility. 

Why then the popular idea that a hard-boiled egg is " ab- 
solutely indigestible " ? A hard boiled egg, or more than one, 
eaten rapidly, without mastication, at a picnic, and with 
much sweet food at. an unusual hour, may interfere with the 
" ease and comfort in digestion " resulting from such a meal. 
But if the whites of the hard-boiled eggs are chopped fine, 
the yolk mashed, and the two served upon toast, thus insur- 
ing mastication, a dish is produced that is of average diges- 
tibility and that may be used for breakfast or luncheon with- 
out hesitation. 

If a tender, jellylike consistency is wanted, cook the egg 
below the boiling point of water. If, however, a firmer egg 
is preferred, use the old time method, and cook the egg three 
or four minutes in boiling water. It is the easier and quicker 
method. 

Moreover, do not hesitate to use an egg " boiled " half an 
hour, provided it is chopped fine or sliced. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

i. Eggs used raw. — An egg, swallowed whole, followed by a cracker, 
is a " quick lunch " that is not harmful, and it is sometimes 
convenient to be able to take an egg in this way. A sprinkling 
of salt upon it makes it more agreeable. 

2. Beaten eggs. — Beat the yolk and white separately. Add to 
the yolk a teaspoonful of sugar, a shake of salt, some flavor- 
ing, and | of a cup of milk. Beat the white gently into this 
mixture and serve in a glass. The flavoring may be a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of vanilla, or a tablespoonful of orange juice. 
This is sometimes served to an invalid who can take milk, and 
is an agreeable luncheon for any one. If milk does not agree 
with one, a larger amount of fruit juice may be used with the 
addition of some water, possibly carbonated. The white 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 143 

alone is given in cases of severe illness, mixed with a small 

amount of water, and fruit juice if the physician permits the 

latter. This is sometimes the only food that can be retained 

by an invalid. 

Principles of egg cookery. — Protein in the form of an egg-albumin 

is the foodstuff to consider in the cooking of eggs. Heat produces 

in the egg a change in color and in texture or firmness, the firmness 

or hardness depending upon the degree of heat and the length of 

time given to the cooking. Coagulation is the term used for this 

change in the egg-albumin. 

1. The white of egg begins to coagulate and to show an opaque 
white at about 180° F. 

2. A temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water 
for about ten minutes will give the white a jellylike, tender con- 
sistency, and slightly cook the yolk. Continued for an hour, the 
white becomes solid and adheres to the shell. 

3. The boiling point of water gives a firmer consistency than a 
temperature below this point. The white is free from the shell. 

4. A high temperature, that of a hot pan, will produce a leathery 
consistency if long continued. 

A. An experiment with the egg. 

Apparatus and materials. — A ring stand, wire net, Bunsen burner, 
glass beaker, test tube, chemical thermometer, white or egg. 

Method. — Put the beaker two thirds full of water on the wire 
net over the flame. Put enough white of egg into the test tube to 
cover the bulb of the thermometer when this is put into the tube. 
Clamp the test tube so that it rests in the water in the beaker. 
The surface of the water should stand above the top of the white of 
egg. Clamp the thermometer so that it is held in the white of egg 
in the test tube. The white should be stirred with a fork before 
it is put into the test tube, and only a small quantity used. 

Note: 1. The temperature when the first visible change occurs. 

2. The temperature when the whole mass becomes of a 

jellylike consistency. 

3. The temperature when the water reaches the boiling 

point. Remove ; note the consistency. 

3. Jellied or coddled eggs. — See that the shells are whole and clean. 
If the eggs are just taken from the refrigerator, lay them in 



144 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

warm water a few minutes. Make ready a double boiler, the 
lower part half full of boiling water. Put the required number 
of eggs into the inner boiler, cover with water that has just 
stopped boiling, put on the boiler cover, and stand the boiler 
where the water below will no longer boil. The eggs will be 
done in from six to eight minutes. 

Having performed the preceding experiment, you should be 
able to invent another way of accomplishing this result. 

4. Boiled eggs. — Put one egg at a time from a tablespoon in- 

to boiling water. Allow the water to boil for three or four 
minutes, depending upon the preference of those served. 
Remove the eggs, and serve at once. 

The hard-boiled egg should remain in the boiling water half 
an hour. 

Bearing in mind the fact that hard-boiled eggs must be 
chopped or sliced, cannot you invent a way of using them in a 
luncheon dish? 

5. Poached eggs. — Make ready a frying pan by setting muffin 

rings in it, and filling it about half full of gently simmering 
water, with a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Break the 
eggs one at a time into a saucer, and slip each egg carefully into 
a muffin ring. See that the pan stands where the water is just 
below the boiling point, for rapidly bubbling water breaks the 
eggs. When the white begins to set, pour the hot water 
gently over the tops of the eggs from a spoon. Cook until the 
white is firm. Slip a griddle cake turner under the egg, lift 
it gently, and place it upon a piece of buttered toast which 
you have ready on a hot plate, or platter, and remove the ring. 
An easier method resembling the poached egg is to break 
the egg raw into a small buttered cup or " patty," standing the 
cups in a pan of water just below the boiling point, the pan 
being on the top of the stove or in the oven. Each egg should 
have a sprinkling of salt, and may have a bit of butter, and a 
shake of pepper. Cover the pan. This process is longer than 
the other, and the eggs must be watched to see when the 
process is complete. 

6. Scrambled eggs. — As the name denotes, this is a process needing 
'a quick motion. Allow an egg to each person. Have ready 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 145 

a frying pan heated, a broad bladed knife, and a tablespoonful 
of butter, or butter substitute, ready to melt in the pan. 

(1) Melt the butter, break the eggs into the pan, without 
beating them, and begin to scrape them from the bottom of 
the pan with the knife, as fast as you can move your hand. 
This is an old-time method, and gives a mixture of white and 
yellow color. Stop the process when the eggs are softer than 
you wish them for serving, as they will stiffen after they are 
removed from the fire. Sprinkle in salt, before you give 
the last scramble, and serve at once. 

(2) Beat the eggs, adding a tablespoonful of water for each 
egg, and a shake of salt for each, and proceed as in (1). 

The omelet. — The novice should see an omelet made, as there 
is a " knack " in the motion not to be conveyed by words. 
The omelet is a French dish, and is made to perfection by the 
French cook. A perfect omelet is rolled or folded over, and is 
creamy within and a golden brown without. " Omelet pans " 
are made for the purpose, but a small frying pan may be used. 
The pan should be perfectly smooth. Do not attempt to 
make an omelet with more than two eggs until you become 
expert. This is one method, and others are used by different 
French cooks. The first stage makes the whole mass creamy, 
the second browns one surface. 

(1) Have the pan warm enough to melt two teaspoonfuls of 
butter, but not hot. Beat two eggs with a fork until they are 
creamy but not foamy, and add two teaspoonfuls of water,' 
with two shakes of salt. 

Put the mixture into the pan, standing the pan where it 
has a medium heat. If over gas, the 1 flame should be low, and 
covered with asbestos. Proceed as with the scrambled egg, 
with great rapidity, and when the mass is creamy, lift the pan, 
tip it slightly, and push the whole mass toward the handle end 
of the pan. Put two teaspoonfuls more of butter in the pan, 
and set it where the heat is intense. Smooth the mass of egg 
over the whole surface of the pan that the omelet may become 
brown underneath. Shake the pan gently back and forth, lift 
the omelet at the edge with a knife to see if the browning is 
accomplished, take the pan from the fire, fold or roll the omelet 
from the handle end of the pan to the front, and turn it out 
upon a hot plate. 



146 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A method easier for the novice is to accomplish the first 
stage in a bowl set into a teakettle, beating into the mass as 
it thickens a teaspoonful of butter, or a tablespoonful of 
cream. When the mixture is evenly creamy, turn it into the 
hot buttered pan and proceed as with (1). 

(2) Light omelet. — This is not a true omelet, but in reality 
a souffle cooked in a frying pan. It is somewhat insipid in 
flavor and is not easier to make well than the French omelet. 
As commonly served it is apt to be underdone or tough. 

With the light omelet, the eggs and whites are separated and 
the whites beaten until light and dry. Beat the yolks until 
creamy, adding water and salt as in (1). Pour this mixture 
over the white, and cut and fold the mass. See page 63. 
Pour this into a buttered baking dish and set in a moderate 
oven. The oven should not be more than 300° F. Serve in 
the pan. 

When gas is used, the souffle may be set in the oven with 
the flame low, and browned for a moment under the flame 
turned high. 

Both of these omelets may be varied by the addition of 
chopped parsley or chopped ham, or grated cheese. 



Laboratory management. When the price of eggs is high, some of the 
experiments can be demonstrated by the teacher. Eggs should be used 
when the price is at its lowest, even if this interferes with the logical se- 
quence of lessons. 

Milk and Milk Products 

Milk is the natural food of the young mammal, and con- 
tains all the foodstuffs in a form easily assimilable. Starch 
is not present, the carbohydrate being found in the form of 
lactose, or milk sugar, a sugar differing somewhat from the 
sugars found in vegetables and fruit (see Chapter X). 

Whole milk and the milk products, cream, butter, and 
cheese, are all important food materials among the nations 
of the western world ; and the manufacture of milk products, 
such as condensed milk, butter, and cheese, has developed 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 147 

large industries. While the Chinese and Japanese are two 
great peoples who have not utilized milk or any of its prod- 
ucts as food for grown people to any extent, yet we are fully 
justified in counting these foods among the necessities. 
Nothing can fully take the place of milk in the family dietary. 
Figure 41 shows how all the foodstuffs are represented in 
milk. When milk first comes from the cow the fat is sus- 
pended in tiny, invisible particles throughout the water, 
giving the milk its yellow tint, and the fat rises to the top 
in the form of cream after a few hours. The protein, sugar, 
and ash are dissolved in the water. When milk reaches the 
stomach, the protein separates from the water in the form of 
curd. This change is brought about by an enzyme (soluble 
ferment) called rennin, which is present, along with pepsin, 
in the gastric juice. Curd is also formed by the souring of 
milk through the action of bacteria, or by adding acid di- 
rectly to the milk. Milk should never be gulped down, but 
taken in sips, so that only small portions of curd are formed 
in the stomach, because these are much easier to digest than 
large ones. Sometimes milk is soured purposely, as in butter- 
milk or zoolak or matzoon, that curds may form and be 
beaten fine before it is drunk. This is very easy to digest, 
because then no large curds can form. For the same reason, 
it is often better to take milk with bread or some other food, 
or to cook it in some dish. Skim milk is a valuable food, for 
it has everything found in whole milk but the fat. We miss 
the flavor of the fat in drinking it, hence it is better to use it 
in pudding or soup or in cooking cereals where we do not care 
so much about the milk flavor. Study Fig. 41, comparing 
the percentages of the foodstuffs in whole, skim, and butter- 
milk, and cream. Notice that the skim milk is higher than

the forms of ash in milk are most valuable, and that it is 
richer in calcium than any other food material. How these 
foods compare in fuel value is shown in Fig. 42. 

Wholesome and clean milk. — At present, the milk supply 
is one of our most pressing community problems, showing

how closely the country and the city are united. A case of 
typhoid fever in one farm family, not properly cared for, may 
be the seed of a serious epidemic in some town. To insure 
clean milk to the consumer, and a fair return in money to the 
producer, is a great sanitary and commercial problem, not 
to be solved in a day. 

Milk is a medium in which bacteria nourish, both the harm- 
less and the disease producing. Typhoid fever and other 
fatal diseases may be carried by milk from unclean barns 



150 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and dairies, and tuberculosis is possible from diseased cows. 
The cows must be in good health, and the stable clean. 
Figure 43 shows a stable with cement floor and good drainage. 
The cows must themselves be clean, and should be curried

and washed. The milkers should have clean clothes and 
hands, and all receptacles should be sterilized. The milk 
must be rapidly cooled (see Fig. 44), bottled in sterilized 
bottles, kept cool during transportation, and delivered as 
promptly as possible to the consumer. " Certified " milk 
is produced and handled under the best conditions, but costs 
at least 15 cents a quart. Since a quart of milk is equiv- 
alent to a pound of steak or to 8 eggs, milk even at 15 to 
20 cents a quart is more economical than meat and eggs at 
ordinary prices. At the usual price of 8 to 10 cents a 
quart, milk is very economical as compared with other per- 
ishable foods. 

The question of preservation and pasteurization can be 
treated here but briefly. Preservatives are forbidden by 
law in most states. Pasteurization is heating at a tempera- 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 



151 



ture sufficiently high to kill any disease germs present, but 
not high enough to give a cooked taste. This process, while 
it destroys most of the bacteria, does not kill the spores of all. 
The chief arguments against pasteurization are (1) that on a 
commercial scale it is difficult to really accomplish this, and 
(2) that it is easily used to cover the sale of unclean milk. 
The argument for it is, that it is impossible to obtain as yet

an ideal supply for a large city in hot weather, and that 
pasteurization, if properly conducted, kills nearly all of the 
dangerous bacteria and saves the lives of many babies. 
Clean milk that needs no pasteurization is our ultimate 
aim, and we must remember that milk pasteurized under 
unknown conditions needs to be kept cold and treated with 
even more care than fresh milk, for it " spoils " quite as easily, 
only we may not know it because it may not taste sour. 
In the last few years the question of pasteurization has 



152 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

been studied with very great care. It is found best to heat 
the milk for 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 140° to 
155° F. If it is certain that this method has been used, one 
need not hesitate to trust the milk, for the arguments against 
pasteurization do not properly apply here. 

How to buy. — Investigate by question and inspection, if 
possible, the available milk supply. Be sure to do this in the 
country in the summer. Always buy bottled milk. Where 
the income is small, good quality milk should be used for the 
little children and invalids, and skim milk purchased for 
cooking. In many places skim milk is supplied in bottles 
by reliable firms. The usual price for bottled milk in the 
city is 8 to 10 cents, and this is of good average quality. 
Keep milk cold. If there is no ice, use an ice substitute 
(page 74), and in very hot weather pasteurize or scald the 
milk, cooling afterward as quickly as possible by placing in 
cold water and stirring the water. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cookery. — Clean, sweet milk is an ideal food, which 
requires no cooking. Heating milk to 212° F. changes its proper- 
ties in some way, so that it is not considered an ideal food for 
babies' regular diet. If it must be used, for reasons of safety, 
some uncooked food, such as orange juice, should also be given. 
This is the reason for pasteurizing milk instead of boiling it. 

Heating milk in an open vessel causes some of the protein to 
harden into a thin " skin " on the top. This can be prevented 
by stirring the milk until it is cool. 

i. To pasteurize milk. — This cannot be done accurately without 
a thermometer. The milk bottle should be placed upon a 
rack in a kettle of .water, with a clean thermometer inserted 
through the cover of the bottle. Heat the water slowly, 
and watch the thermometer. When it reaches 155° F., see that 
the water becomes no hotter. Set the kettle on a rack on 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 153 

the stove top, or use a simmering burner with rack and as- 
bestos mat. It is difficult to keep the temperature even, but 
it should remain at 140-155° F. half an hour. At the end of 
half an hour, the bottle should be removed, and eooled as 
rapidly as possible in running cold water. 

2. Rennet custard. — 1 quart milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 

a shake of salt, flavoring, 1 rennet tablet. The flavoring 
may be : 1 teaspoonful vanilla, or a few tablespoonfuls of 
orange juice, or the vanilla, plus three or four tablespoonfuls of 
cocoa to suit the taste. 

To prepare. — This is a process without cooking. Rennet 
tablets are made from the stomach of the calf, and contain the 
digestive enzyme, rennin, which results in the solidifying of the 
curd of the milk. Rennet custard has passed the first stage of 
milk digestion. 

Put all the flavoring substances into the milk, and warm it 
slightly, not more than 100° F. The cocoa when used should 
be " dissolved " in a small amount of hot water. Dissolve 
the rennet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and stir this very 
thoroughly into the milk. Pour the milk into the cups in which 
the custard will be served, and set the cups in a warm but not 
hot place. A good method is to place them in a pan of warm 
water (100° F.). The milk becomes firm in a half hour or an 
hour, and as soon as it is set, should be put in the ice box, other- 
wise the process continues and the custard becomes watery 
as the curd shrinks and forces out the whey. Serve very cold 
with fruit on the top, or whipped cream with the cocoa flavoring ; 
or put grated nutmeg or powdered cinnamon on the top. 
This is a simple and delicious dessert, and one of the most whole- 
some. For children it should be flavored with fruit juice or 
vanilla rather than with cocoa. 

3. Uses of sour milk. — Do not throw away any sour milk that is 

clean and not stale. Milk that has soured enough to set, is a 
delicious dessert, with cream and sugar. The acid is very pleas- 
ant, being the same as that of buttermilk. Sour milk is better for 
griddlecakes and muffins than sweet milk. (See Chapter XI.) 
Another excellent use for sour milk is to make it into cottage 
cheese. (See below.) 



154 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Matzoon and other similar preparations are essentially 
soured milks, prepared under controlled conditions. These 
preparations . are the common form of milk in certain parts 
of the Orient, where milk is never used sweet. 

Kumyss is milk slightly soured and fermented with one 
species of yeast. This is a Russian method. These prep- 
arations are excellent for invalids and exhausted people, 
for they can sometimes be assimilated because of the fine 
curds when sweet milk cannot. 

Condensed milk is a practical method of preserving milk. 
The milk is evaporated under pressure at a high temperature 
in apparatus constructed for the purpose. Cane sugar or 
glucose is sometimes added. A new patent process con- 
denses the milk at low temperature, preserving it for a short 
period, as compared with the condensed milk in tins, but it 
keeps well for several days, and bears transportation. Con- 
densed milk may be used in cooking, when clean fresh milk 
is not available. The unsweetened kinds are most useful, 
but, like pasteurized milk, must be treated with care after 
the cans are opened. 

Cheese. — Cheese is made from the curd of milk, and con- 
tains the most nutritive parts of the milk in highly con- 
centrated form. In the process of manufacture, the milk 
is first curdled by rennet, and the whey strained out. The 
curds after preliminary treatment, varying according to the 
style of cheese to be made, are finally pressed together very 
slowly in a cheese press, which is screwed down more tightly 
as the cheese becomes dryer. The cheeses are then covered 
with cheesecloth and " ripened " slowly, the ripening process 
giving characteristic consistency and flavor. This ripening 
is due to the action of bacteria and molds. (See page 97.) 
Foreign varieties of cheese, made originally in some one lo- 
cality, have marked colors, quality, and flavors, as Brie, 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 



155 



Camembert, Roquefort, and 

the Swiss cheeses. Parmesan 
is an Italian cheese, excellent 
with macaroni and spaghetti. 

American cheeses vary in 
color, in strength of flavor, 
in creaminess, and in degree 
of hardness. Much the 
greater part is, however, of 
the general type known as 
"American cheddar" or 
"standard factory" cheese. 

Club cheese is an American 
cheese of good quality, put 
up in small jars. It is a soft 
cheese, excellent to serve with 
crackers, but is too expensive 
for common use. 

Cottage cheese is a home 
product made from sour milk, 
and used at once. 

Composition and nutritive 
value. — Cheese is high in 
protein, and usually in fat. 
(See Fig. 40.) Note the small 
amount of water, which 
makes cheese a very concen- 
trated food. The protein 
content makes it a meat sub- 
stitute, for those with whom 
cheese does not disagree. 
Being a dense as well as con- 
centrated form of food, it 




156 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

should be eaten in small quantities, and in combination with 
other food materials .in such a way that it will become finely 
divided, or it will not be easily digested. The ash content 
is high, the most valuable of the ash constituents of the milk 
being retained in the cheese. 

The cost of cheese. — The foreign cheeses are expensive, 
but American cheeses may be classed among the moderate 
priced foods and they compare favorably with other protein 
foods. 

Cheese costs more than beans, and less than most cuts 
of meat. A good American cheese costs about twenty-five 
cents per pound. Taking account of composition as well as 
cost per pound, we find that a given amount of money buys 
about twice as much food value when spent for cheese as it 
would if spent for beef. See Fig. 45. 

Care of cheese in the pantry. — Cheese should be kept dry 
and covered, that its odor may not be noticeable. Soft 
cheese should be kept in the ice box. The receptacle for 
cheese should be thoroughly sterilized before each new pur- 
chase is put away. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

i. Uncooked cheese. — Serve a cream cheese with a salad of let- 
tuce, and the imported cheeses with crackers and fruit for 
dessert. American cheese may be thinly sliced and used in 
sandwiches. A small piece of cheese with apple pie or pudding 
is an old-fashioned combination that is always agreeable, but 
sometimes difficult of digestion. 

2. Cottage cheese. — Use sour milk that has set. Other ingre- 
dients : salt to taste, cayenne pepper or paprika, if liked. 
Quality and flavor are improved by the addition of a table- 
spoonful of butter or two tablespoonfuls of cream to a pint of 
the curd, but these are not necessary. 

Warm the milk slowly, until the whey begins to separate 
from the curd. If this process is continued too long, and the 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 157 

milk becomes hot, the curd will be tough. Place a piece of 
cheesecloth over a bowl, pour in the curds and whey, and lift 
the cloth carefully, allowing the whey to run through. Squeeze 
out the remaining whey. Add the seasoning and other ingre- 
dients to the curd, shape in balls, and chill before serving. It 
is delicious served with lettuce and dressing as a salad, or with 
gingerbread for dessert at luncheon or supper. 
Principles of cooking cheese. — The fat in the cheese is melted by 
heat. The protein is toughened by a high temperature, there- 
fore a low temperature process should be used. 

3. Cheese cooked with other food materials. — A creamy cheese 

should be selected for cooking. Cheese may be grated and 
sprinkled on the top of potato on the half shell, or any 
other mashed potato ; or it may be sliced and placed with each 
layer in escalloped potato. Its use is common with macaroni ; 
and a dish of macaroni with milk and cheese is a good meat 
substitute, and may be used as the main dish of a luncheon or 
simple dinner. Those to whom cheese is agreeable will find 
many places for its use. Its flavor harmonizes with celery and 
with tomato. The Italians serve grated Parmesan cheese with 
soup, and with spaghetti that has a tomato sauce. 

4. Cheese crackers. — Select crackers of a firm quality that will 

not crumble or flake easily, and of a small size. Spread very 
thinly with soft butter, put the crackers in a pan, and 
sprinkle grated cheese upon each one. Set the pan in a mod- 
erate oven until the cheese is melted. A sprinkling of paprika 
may be used. Serve with lettuce, celery, or other green salad.

CHAPTER X 

THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 

Fats are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but 
have much more carbon than the other kinds of foodstuffs. 
Notice in Fig. 46 that olive oil and lard are pure fats 
the other fat foods containing water, protein, and ash. Fat 
is available in various forms, with differing flavors and a 
wide range of prices. To many people it is unpalatable in 
some of its cheapest forms ; yet its use is important, and some 
kind should be included in the diet. Fluid and emulsified 
fats are the most easily digested, hence olive oil, cream, and 
egg yolk are highly desirable. Bacon and butter belong 
nearly in the same class. A vigorous man at hard labor can 
digest fat of any kind without difficulty, and needs it because 
it gives so much fuel in proportion to its bulk. 

Fat tends to retard gastric digestion, and delicate persons 
must be careful about taking with it other foods which are 
hard to digest, or taking it in the form of fried foods, pastries, 
rich cakes, and sauces. Persons with delicate appetite, 
who lose weight because they do not get enough fuel, may be 
benefited by taking a little more fat in the diet, especially 
if they do not digest starch and sugar readily, but a very 
large amount (over 6 or 7 ounces a day) will not be perfectly 
digested. 

Fat as a food. — Beef fat, as it occurs with lean, is a digestible fat. 
If thoroughly browned in the cooking process, it is most pala- 
table, and the taste for it should be cultivated. In gravy, it may 
be used with potato, instead of butter. Pat tried out from suet, may

be used in place of butter as an ingredient in some puddings, and 
even in batter mixtures. It may also be used with vegetables when 
the price of butter is prohibitive. See Fig. 47. 

Bacon is a digestible and agreeable form of fat, but it is not so 
cheap as beef fat, though cheaper than, butter. 

Fat pork is lower in price than bacon, and can be assimilated by 
vigorous people, especially those living out of doors. 

Cream is one of the most delicious fatty food materials, and is 
digestible, but ranks with butter and bacon as to cost. While it 
is not a cheap food, it is not such an extravagance when moderately 
used as some people suppose, who have not worked out the problem. 
Usually the most economical source of cream is to take it from 
the top of the bottle of milk. The remaining partially skimmed 
milk may be used at table or in cooking or for making cottage 
cheese. 

Butter is a digestible fat, ranking at present among the more 
expensive food materials. 

Watchfulness is necessary with both cream and milk that clean- 
liness and quality may be insured. 

Butter substitutes. — These are made from beef fat and other 
edible fats and oils, and are much less expensive than butter. They 
may be used in cooking -with good result. The usual trade names 
are butterine, or oleomargarine, or some word similar to these. 
Oleomargarine has .the same food value as butter at lower cost, but 
lacks fine flavor. 

Olive or sweet oil. — The fat content of olive oil is one hundred 
per cent, its fuel value being equal to that of lard. See Fig. 46. 
It is made in Italy, France, Spain, and California, the oils from 
the different countries differing somewhat in flavor. The cheaper 
grades are sometimes adulterated with corn oil or cottonseed oil, 
which have the same food value but should, of course, be sold undei- 
their own names and not at olive oil prices. An American firm is 
now manufacturing olive oil in Spain ; this and the California 
olive oil are of high grade. Italian oil by the gallon is of good 
quality, and usually somewhat less expensive than the French. 
It is a costly food material, but valuable in the dietary. Never 
buy it in small bottles, as this adds greatly to the cost. The most 
economical- method is to purchase by the gallon in a tin can. If 
kept cool, it will not deteriorate except very slowly. Always wipe 
off the mouth of the bottle or can before pouring out the oil. 

M 



162 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Fat as a cooking medium. — Fat is necessary for the saut6, 
and for deep fat frying./- For deep fat frying several prep- 
arations are made from cottonseed oil that are agreeable 
to use and of moderate price. 

Lard has been the most commonly used, but many people object 
to the flavor. Beef drippings should be saved and kept cool in 
covered jelly glasses. These drippings are useful for browning 
vegetables, meatballs, and in pan-broiling if a small amount of 
additional fat is necessary. 

When deep fat frying is used, great pains must be taken to 
see that the fat is sufficiently hot in order that the food ma- 
terial may not soak fat, and the cooked food must be kept 
hot when the fat is draining off on absorptive paper. The 
best fats for this purpose are the vegetable oils. The re- 
fined cottonseed oils now on the market are excellent. For 
details of use see page 120. Keep a box of sand to pour into 
it, if the kettle of fat takes fire. Never pour water into 
blazing fat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

Fat melts at a low temperature. 
At about 350° F. it begins to smoke. 

At a higher temperature, a chemical change takes place, and the 
fat finally " burns," as the hydrogen and oxygen pass off. 

It is emulsified by mixing with a substance like egg. 
i. To whip cream. — Chill the cream, and set it in a bowl of ice 
water, or chipped ice. If the cream is warm, the beating will 
churn the cream to butter. 

(1) For a fine, close-whipped eream use a Dover egg beater. 

(2) For a lighter whipped cream, use a wire beater. 

2. To mold butter. — A pair of wooden butter pats is necessary 
for this. Dip these first into hot water, then into cold. Cut 
off a square piece of butter, enough for one person, make it 
flat or round with two knives, and then roll it into shape 
between the butter pats. Chill, and serve in a dish on ice ; 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 163 

or give one to each person on a butter plate, just at the last 
moment before serving the meal. Never serve soft butter. 

3. To cook bacon. — Bacon has alternate layers of fat and lean, 

but it is the fat that has chief consideration in the cook- 
ing process. The aim is to brown and crisp the fat without 
burning it and without causing a volume of smoke in the 
kitchen. Make ready a frying pan, and have at hand a jar 
for holding fat standing on a plate. Cut the bacon in thin 
shoes with a sharp knife. Heat the pan, and put in the bacon. 
The fat will begin to '' try out " at the melting point. Pour 
this melted fat into the jar. Turn the pieces of bacon with a fork. 
If the smoke is rising in volumes the pan is too hot. The 
novice should not try this experiment for the first time by her- 
self. The fat may even burst into flame if the pan is too hot. 
When the bacon is sufficiently cooked to become crisp on cool- 
ing, it is ready to serve, by itself, with toast, or with eggs. 

The making of sauces and gravies. — Many sauces and 
gravies are made from a fat, mixed with a starchy substance, 
the two mingled with a liquid. The fat gives flavor and 
nutriment, the starch is used for thickening, the liquid also 
gives flavor. You are now familiar with the cooking of fat 
and starch, and can readily understand that the combination 
of all these ingredients is not an easy matter. The fat will 
float upon the top of the liquid unless the right amount of 
starch or flour is used, and the flour will have a tendency to 
lump. There are several good methods in use. The method 
given for your experiment is one of the simplest, because it 
uses only a few utensils, and gives uniformly good results. 
It requires no more watchfulness than the other methods. 

These sauces and gravies are not foods for little children 
and invalids. 

4. Foundation recipe for sauces. 

Proportions. 

(1) Thin sauce (for milk toast) 

1 tablespoonful of fat, 1 of flour, f pint liquid. 



164 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

or (2) Medium sauce (for vegetables). 

2 tablespoonfuls of fat, 2 of flour, i pint liquid. 

or (3) Thicker sauce, also for vegetables, meats, fish, and 
macaroni. 

3 tablespoonfuls of fat- 3 of flour, f pint liquid. 
Salt is used to taste. 

Method. — Melt the fat in a saucepan. Pour in the flour, 
all at once, and stir the flour and fat together, until the mass 
thickens slightly. Pour in all the liquid at once, cold. Set 
the saucepan where the heat is moderate. 

Stir steadily with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens. 

5. A white sauce is made with butter, and milk the liquid. Stop 

the cooking just short of the boiling point. 

6. A tomato sauce is made with butter or beef fat, strained tomato 

juice the liquid. Cook a piece of onion, a sprig of parsley, 
or a small portion of dried herbs, and a clove with the tomato 
before straining, if these flavors are liked. 

7. A brown sauce or meal gravy may be made in the same way, using 

beef fat, and (as the liquid) water that has been poured into 
the pan in which the meat is cooked. When you are familiar 
with cooking there is an easier way for thickened meat gravies, 
as follows : 

Pour off some of the fat from the meat pan. Set the pan 
upon the stove and stir in the flour, — about two tablespoonfuls 
for the ordinary roasting pan. When the flour is thoroughly 
mixed in, add about a pint of water, cold or warm, and stir 
again. Pour this mixture through a strainer. With practice 
you can make an excellent gravy in this way. It requires 
judgment to proportion the flour and liquid to the material 
in the pan. 

The Sugars 

Sugars are of common occurrence in the vegetable world 
in the fruits and juices of many plants. Pure grape juice 
may contain as high as 25 per cent of glucose though usually 
it is not so concentrated. Glucose is also found in consider- 
able amount in sweet corn and onions. It is not so sweet as

cane sugar (sucrose). Fructose is one of the sweetest of 
sugars, and helps to give honey its great sweetness. 

Lactose or milk sugar is found chiefly in milk. It is the 
least sweet of all the sugars. If there were as much cane 
sugar in milk, we should soon grow tired of it because it would 
be too sweet. It is sometimes added to milk to make its 
fuel value higher, especially in case the milk has been diluted, 
as in the diet of babies and invalids. 

Maltose or malt sugar is formed from starch in germinating 
seeds. 

Sucrose or cane sugar is most commonly manufactured 
from sugar cane and sugar beets. To a much smaller extent 
it is made commercially from the sugar maple, sorghum cane, 
and sugar palm, and it is found in considerable amount in 
some common fruits and vegetables. 

Its manufacture forms a great industry, and its consumption 
is enormous, some ten million tons coming into commerce 
annually, and this does not represent the total consumption. 

Figure 48 shows the composition of several common sugars. 
Notice that the granulated sugar is a pure foodstuff, being 
100 per cent carbohydrate, while all the others contain traces 
of protein, ash, and water. Sugar is a fuel food, exclusively, 
like olive oil and other pure fats. 

Sugar is a valuable food material, but should not be used 
in excess ; the tendency in the United States is rather toward 
an excessive use of sugar. It is liable to cause an acid fer- 
mentation in digestion, when taken in large amounts, and is 
sure to irritate the stomach. It should be well diluted by 
other foods. The amount that may be eaten daily varies 
for most people from two ounces for young children to four 
ounces for adults, but many people cannot eat these amounts 
without more or less irritation of the stomach. It is a com- 
mon practice to oversweeten cakes and desserts, the sweet- 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 167 

ness of the sugar often disguising other agreeable flavors. 
The liking for sweets should be well under control, for the 
eating of too much sugar is a habit easy to form, and one 
which crowds out other valuable foods. 

Cane Sugar is sold both brown and white, and is manu- 
factured in powdered, granulated, and solid form, the latter 
usually cut in cubes or dominoes. 

The canes are first crushed, the juices passing from the 
machine being of a rather dark greenish color. This juice 
is first clarified and filtered, and then boiled down in order to 
crystallize the sugar, the liquid sirup forming molasses. 
In the older methods the sirup was boiled in open pans, and 
the crystals filtered from the molasses by a slow process. 
In the modern process the sirup is boiled at a low temperature 
in vacuum pans, and the sugar is separated from the molasses 
by a centrifugal machine, built on the same principle as a 
cream separator. The principles of beet sugar manufacture 
are essentially the same, with some differences in detail. 

The molasses manufactured in the older method is richer 
in cane sugar and is a better table molasses than the new 
process molasses, the latter being used chiefly for the manu- 
facture of alcohol. Molasses is either dark or light, the 
darker having a stronger flavor especially suited to ginger- 
bread and Indian meal pudding. Molasses comes in the 
bulk, and may be slightly acid ; or in cans, in which case no 
acid fermentation should have taken place. Where canned 
molasses is used in a batter, it is sometimes necessary to 
use baking powder instead of soda. " New Orleans " is a 
light-colored molasses, " Porto Rico " dark. 

Brown sugar has not passed through the refining processes 
necessary to the whitening of the sugar. It is softer than the 
granulated white, has a decided brownish color and a rich 
flavor. 



168 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

In buying sugar it is economy to purchase granulated in 
large quantities, a fraction of a cent per pound being saved 
in this way. The cut sugar comes in convenient boxes, 
which keep the product clean. Powdered sugar may be 
bought in small quantities, three or five pounds, since it is 
not used so much in cooking as the granulated. 

Candy, homemade and purchased. — Candy, if not eaten 
between meals, is an allowable form of sugar. The best 
time for eating it is at the end of a meal, one or two pieces. 
Even in this case, however, it would be better for the body if 
the craving for sweet were satisfied by fruit rather than candy. 

Candy made at home costs less than high grade commer- 
cial candy, even counting in the labor. It is superior to cheap 
grade candy, which may even contain poisonous coloring 
matter. It is a pleasure to make it at times, and it is always 
a pleasing gift at the holiday season. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

A sirup is formed by cooking sugar with water. 

The sirup thickens if process is prolonged and water evaporates. 

Cane sugar is changed to glucose and fructose by boiling with 
an acid. 

Heated without additional water, the sugar is partially decom- 
posed, giving off water and becoming brown in color. This is 
" caramel," used for coloring, and flavoring. 

The final stage of heating leaves pure carbon.

rich brown color. The sugar will lump badly at first, but these 
lumps will entirely melt in time. Turn the chopped peanuts 
and salt into the sirup and stir together and immediately 
turn out on a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces. 

9. Fudge. 

Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar J teaspoonful 

Chocolate 2 squares 

Milk or water 1 cup 

Vanilla 1 teaspoonful 

Method. — Mix the first four ingredients and place over a 
hot fire. Stir steadily until the mixture begins to boil. Stir 
occasionally after this until, when half a teaspoonful is dropped 
into cold water, it may be rolled to a soft ball with the fingers. 
Set the saucepan in a cool place and leave until it becomes 
just lukewarm. Add the vanilla and stir the mixture until it 
becomes thick and seems very slightly granular. Pour it into 
a buttered tin and as soon as possible cut into squares. The 
exact point at which to remove the fudge from the fire and 
again at which to cease stirring and pour into the pan is a 
matter which only practice can teach. 

10. Penocha. 

Ingredients. 

Brown sugar 2 cups 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk, cream, or water 1 cup 

Cream of tartar | teaspoon or less 

Vanilla 1 teaspoon 

Method. — As with recipe 9. The very dark brown sugar 
contains some acid and therefore less cream of tartar may 
be used. Chopped nuts may be added with the vanilla to 
both fudge and penocha. 

11. Fondant for French creams. 

Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar \ teaspoonful 

Boiling water f cup 



170 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method. — Mix the sugar and cream of tartar. Add the 
boiling water and place over a moderate fire, stirring slowly 
and steadily until the sugar is dissolved. Do not stir after 
the mixture begins to boil, but let it boil slowly until the 
sirup will form a soft ball in cold water. Turn out on a platter 
without scraping the saucepan. The success of the fondant 
depends upon the complete changing of the cane sugar into 
fructose and glucose, the crystals of the latter being much finer 
than those of cane sugar. Stirring the mixture while it boils or 
before it has cooled sufficiently will result in the formation of 
cane sugar crystals, and the fondant will be harsh and rough. 

When the fondant is barely lukewarm begin to stir it with 
long steady strokes and continue this until the mixture becomes 
creamy and thick and begins to break away from the sides of 
the dish and the spoon. Then gather it all together into a 
round mass and knead like bread until it becomes pliable. It 
may then be wrapped in oiled paper or put into a covered 
bowl or fruit jar and kept until wanted. 

Fondant is the foundation for all bon bons and may be made 
up into a great variety of shapes and with many flavors. It 
may be mixed with chopped candied fruits or nuts or coated 
with chocolate.

CHAPTER XI 

MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 

Wheat flour is the important material in this group, but 
muffins and biscuit may be varied by the use of corn meal, 
rye, and Graham flour, and cooked cereals may also be uti- 
lized. The ingredients are flour, salt, a liquid, sometimes a 
fat, eggs, and sugar. The flavorings are spices, essences, 
fruit juice, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate. The mixture must 
be smooth, but it is also necessary to make it porous or 
" light." This is accomplished by means of leavening agents, 
" to leaven " meaning " to make light." 

Leavening agents. — The batter, or dough, is leavened by 
introducing into it air or a gas that expands when heated in 
the oven, thus making the whole more porous and larger in 
bulk. 

Air. — This is introduced into the batter by beating, or by beat- 
ing air into the white of egg and stirring the beaten white into the 
batter. 

Steam. — The water in the batter turns to steam in the oven, 
and as it expands it assists in the leavening of the mass. See 
Popovers. ** 

Carbon dioxide gas. — This is introduced in three ways. 

(1) By using an acid with a carbonate. 

(2) By yeast fermentation. 

(3) By machinery. 

Yeast fermentation is studied in the chapter on bread making 
(Chapter XII), and the mechanical method is a commercial process 
exclusively. Only the first method will be treated in this 
chapter. 

When an acid and any alkaline carbonate are dissolved together, 

171 



172 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a chemical action takes place, a gas is given off (carbon dioxide) 
and another substance is formed that is neutral, being neither acid 
nor alkaline, and known as a " salt." In selecting the two sub- 
stances we must bear in mind this neutral substance that remains 
in the batter and insure its harmlessness. 

The lactic acid of sour milk is probably the earliest used, being a 
domestic product. The lactic acid is neutralized by bicarbonate 
of sodium, the latter being also called " baking soda." The resulting 
salt is harmless. 

Acid molasses with soda is another old-fashioned method. Here 
the acid is developed by the fermentation of the molasses. 

Cream of tartar (acid potassium tartrate), obtained from crystals 
deposited in wine vats, came into use later, neutralized by bicar- 
bonate of soda, two parts of cream of tartar to one of soda. 

Baking powder. — The first baking powders were made of cream 
of tartar and bicarbonate of soda, mixed with a starch, to prevent 
the slight chemical action which would cause the. powder to lose 
strength ; and these two substances are now used in the best baking 
powders. The resulting salt is the Rochelle salt of medicine. 

An acid phosphate is sometimes used with soda, and this gives 
a harmless neutral substance. 

Cheaper acids have sometimes been used, especially alum. It 
is best not to use an alum powder. Select a standard kind, avoid- 
ing those that offer prizes for a certain number of boxes purchased. 
Even if these latter do not contain alum, there is probably an excess 
of starch or flour. 

The advantage of baking powder is in the accuracy of the propor- 
tions of the two substances by weight. Even though the measur- 
ing of the cream of tartar and soda separately is accurate, the 
proportions may not be correct. There is no great advantage in 
homemade baking powder. It costs almost as much as the manu- 
factured, and is not as perfect a product. 

The proportions of the main ingredients. — Attempts are 
made to define the degrees of stiffness of batters and doughs, 
but these distinctions are not very accurate. A "pour bat- 
ter " is liquid enough to pour, and a " dough batter " soft 
enough to drop from a spoon; a "soft dough" is next in 
grade, and " dough " is the stiff est of all. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 173 

To understand proportioning the ingredients, the nature 
of the ingredients when heated must be taken into account. 
Butter and other fats melt when heated, and behave like a 
liquid in the mixture. Therefore, when there is a very large 
amount of butter, no other wetting is necessary, as in pound 
cake. We may make a scale, with a thin popover mixture 
at one extreme, with no butter in it, and the stiff pound cake 
at the other, with butter the only liquid (except the flavor- 
ing). Between these two are the mixtures of medium stiff- 
ness, with both butter and liquid. This general rule may 
be given : As the quantity of butter is increased, the batter 
must increase in stiffness, and there must be either less liquid 
or more flour. 

A beaten egg looks like a liquid and behaves so during the 
mixing, but in the oven it stiffens. For this reason we can 
make a sponge cake with many eggs and no liquid in the 
mixing, and use no other leavening agent than the air beaten 
into the egg. 

One old-fashioned rule for sponge cake reads : Take the 
weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour, 
with the juice and rind of a lemon for ten eggs. Such a rule 
was adapted to the days when eggs were cheap. We should 
now use fewer eggs in sponge cake, and this means that water 
and baking powder must replace the eggs omitted. 

Methods of mixing. — (1) For popovers, griddlecakes, muffins, and 
plain cake. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 

Beat the eggs, without separating the yolk and white, and stir 
the eggs and milk together. 

Pour the liquid gradually into the flour, first stirring, then 
beating. 

Melt the butter or other shortening, and beat it into the batter. 

(2) Biscuits and shortcakes. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 



174 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cut in or chop in the butter. 

Add the wetting slowly. 

(3) A richer, fine-grained butter cake. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 

Cream the butter, and beat in the sugar. 

Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 

Beat the yolks into the creamed butter and sugar. 

Add the flour and milk alternately ; that is, a quarter or third 
of the flour, then a portion of the milk, and so on. First stir, then 
beat vigorously. 

Fold in the beaten whites lightly and do not beat the mixture 
again. 
• (4) Sponge cake. 

If baking powder is used, sift with the flour. 

Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 

Beat the sugar into the yolks, and add the liquid and flavoring. 

Add the flour and beaten whites in alternate portions, dividing 
both into quarters or thirds. 

Baking. — This is a science and an art that requires much 
practice. Do not be discouraged if you do not succeed at 
first. 

Concerning the utensils for baking, see Chapter II. The 
cups or pans are prepared by warming and greasing. Use a 
bit of soft paper or a brush for greasing the pan and 
ordinarily an inexpensive fat, reserving butter for delicate 
cake. Flour sprinkled on a pan is sufficient for biscuit and 
cookies. Line a pan for loaf cake with white paper, and 
grease the paper. 

See that the oven is ready before the mixing begins. We 
shall not be able to bake accurately until our ovens are 
equipped with thermometers. In the meantime we must 
use some simple oven test. The indicators on the doors of 
some ovens are a guide, although they are not really accurate 
according to the scale of the thermometer. A glass door is 
also a convenience. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 175 

A loaf should be baked at a lower temperature than a 
biscuit or muffin. Why? 

For loaves, 380° F. Test by the hand, counting fifteen 
slowly, fifteen seconds. A piece of white paper will become 
a delicate brown in five minutes. 

For biscuits, muffins, and small cakes, 425° to 450° F. — 
Test by the hand, a count of ten. A piece of paper becomes 
a deeper golden brown in five minutes. 

Any mixture containing baking powder may stand some 
little time before it is put in the oven, provided it is kept 
cold. The action of the baking powder is not immediate, 
and is very slight "at a low temperature. 

The stages of the baking are first, the rising ; second, the 
crusting over ; third, the baking of the interior ; and last, a 
shrinkage of the whole. 

Many ovens bake unevenly, and pans must be shifted. 
This should be done with care and not befdre the third stage 
of the baking. It is often well to cool off the oven the latter 
part of the time. An oven that is too hot may be cooled by 
a pan of water. Paper may be laid over the top of the cake 
if the browning has been too rapid. These are all make- 
shifts, and indicate a poor oven, or poor management of the 
fire. Do not look into the oven for the first ten minutes of 
baking, and always close the oven door gently. 

When we are privileged to have electric ovens, with glass 
doors, and an accurate thermometer, baking will be an easy 
and accurate process. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

A. Experiments with baking powder. 

1. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of baking powder in two table- 
spoonfuls of water and heat in a test tube, or saucepan, over a 
flame ; notice the effervescence when the bubbling is at its height, 



176 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and hold a lighted match in the mouth of the tube. This is a simple 
test for carbon dioxide. 

2. Dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar in J cup water in 
a glass. 

Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda in J cup water in 
a glass. 

Taste both of these. 

Test both with litmus paper, noting the change of color. There 
are several vegetable coloring matters that change color in this 
way, in the presence of an acid or an alkaline substance. 

Turn the two solutions together, and test with both blue and 
pink litmus paper, after the solution has stood for several minutes. 
What results? 

Taste this mixed solution to see if you can detect any difference. 

To prove that there is a substance still left, evaporate the water. 

3. A pretty form of this experiment is to use, instead of litmus 
the water in which red cabbage has previously been boiled and 
which therefore contains some of the coloring matter of the cabbage. 
The changes in color are very striking, and prove conclusively that 
neither the cream of tartar nor the soda remains such. 

B. Oven experiments. 

If one oven in the school kitchen can be equipped with a' chemi- 
cal thermometer inserted in the oven, the following experiments 
are helpful. 

1. Let each pupil test the oven by feeling, when it has reached 
380° F., 400° F., 425° F., 450° F., 475° F.-500 F. 

2. Place pieces of white paper, one for each pupil, in the oven 
for five minutes at the various temperatures. These may be pasted 
in the notebook for future reference. 

i. Popovers, puffovers, or mahogany cakes. 

Ingredients for 12.

Some rules give two eggs only. 

For baking, heavy earthen cups, hot and greased. 
Method of mixing is No. 1. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 177 

Special points.: — The liquid must be poured very slowly into 
the flour to prevent lumping. A large. Dover egg beater is 
convenient for beating out lumps, if any occur. 

The leavening of the popover is effected by steam, and it 
is not necessary therefore to spend time and strength in the 
long beating sometimes recommended. This has been con- 
clusively proved by experiment. \ Neither is it necessary to 
, put the batter into the oven immediately, as sometimes di- 
rected. It may stand all day or even over nightj 

Pour the batter in the hot cups, having each cup two thirds 
full. The baking of the popovers is unique, in that they should 
be put into an intensely hot oven for the first stage of the baking 
— as hot as 475° F., or even more — then the oven must be 
cooled. This first stage crusts the top ; then the expansive 
force of the steam pushes up the top ; and the muffin " pops " or 
" puffs " over. The more moderate heat cooks the sides and 
the bottom, and makes an agreeable crust. The perfect puff- 
over is hollow. ( Three quarters of an hour is the average time 
of baking.) If at the end of that time the oven door is set ajar, 
and the popovers allowed to remain longer, they are improved, 
coming from the oven stiff and crisp with a rich brown color, 
rather than soft and underdone. In an old family cookbook, 
one recipe, sixty years old, calls popovers " Mahogany Cakes." 
They may be eaten as a muffin, or served with a pudding 
sauce as a dessert. 
Plain muffins. 

Ingredients for 12. 
Flour 1 pint 

Baking powder 3 teaspoonfuls 

Salt I teaspoonful 

Eggs 2 or 1 

Milk li cup 

Butter, or butter substitute 1 tablespoonful 
Sugar, if desired 1 tablespoonful 

For baking, greased muffin pan. Bake about half an hour. 
Method of mixing is No. 1. 
This recipe may be varied in many ways. 

(a) Use | cup cooked cereal in place of an equal quantity 
of flour. Will you change the amount of wetting? 



178 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) One cup fine white corn meal, or J eup yellow meal in 
place of equal quantities of flour. Corn meal ab- 
sorbs more water than white flour. 

What change in the wetting ? 

The oven should be the temperature for bread, and the 
baking at least f of an hour. 

(c) One cup Graham or rye meal in place of an equal 
quantity of flour. 

3. Baking powder biscuit. 

Ingredients. 

Flour 1 pint 

Baking powder 3 teaspoonfuls 

Salt j teaspoonful 

Butter, or butter substitute 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk 1 scant cup 

For shaping, molding board, rolling pin, and biscuit cutter. 

For baking, an iron sheet or pan sprinkled with flour. Oven 
about 425° F., a ten-second test, or golden brown paper. 
Bake twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Method of mixing is No. 2. 

To shape. Dust the board with flour, turn out the dough, 
dredge with flour, pat into a firm mass, and then pat or lightly 
roll out to 5 inch thickness. Cut out with a cutter dipped in 
flour. (A small glass or the top of a round tin can may be used.) 

Variations. — Add 1 egg. This makes a delicious biscuit. 
Sprinkle the top with granulated sugar, and spice. Dried 
currants washed, and dredged with flour, may be laid on the top. 

Increase the butter to two or three tablespoonfuls, and de- 
crease the wetting and the mixture becomes shortcake. This 
is the mixture to use for the true strawberry shortcake. Many 
other fruits may be used, both uncooked and cooked.

the cakes the same as with sour milk griddlecakes. 

6. Cookies. — Cookies may be plain, or rich in butter ; crisp 
and thin, or soft and thick. They may be sweetened with 
sugar, or molasses, and spiced in various ways. It would be 
an interesting exercise to tabulate all the possible forms of 
cookies.

The flavoring may be two teaspoonfuls of vanilla, or lemon 
essence, one or two tablespoonfuls of ground spice, or caraway 
seeds. 

For baking, a floured iron sheet or flat pan. Temperature 
425° F., or even more. The baking requires from 15 to 20 
minutes, depending on the thickness of the cooky.

The method of mixing is No. 3. Notice that this is a stiff 
dough. The amount of flour depends somewhat upon the ex- 
pertness of the cooky maker. The flour used in rolling out 
must be accounted for, as the expert can manage a softer 
dough than the novice. Mix the baking powder and salt with 
one cup of the flour. 

Shaping the cookies. — ■ Figure 49 shows you the apparatus. 
The dough is turned out upon the floured board, gently rolled 
out to a quarter of an inch, cut and placed in a floured pan ; or 
cut off a small piece, roll in the flour, until it forms a ball, set 
the ball in the pan, and pat it down to a round. This may seem 
to take longer, but it is easier, and there is no board to clean 
afterward.. 

A plainer cooky is made with J cup butter, and § cup water 
or milk, with somewhat more flour.

Flour 2 1 cups 

Soda 1 teaspoonful 

Ginger If teaspoonfuls 

Salt J teaspoonful 

Butter 4 tablespoonfuls 

Method. — Melt butter in boiling water. Mix dry ingredients. 
Add the molasses to the water and butter and stir this mix- 
ture into the dry ingredients, beating vigorously. Pour into a 
buttered shallow pan and bake twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven. If the molasses is taken from a freshly opened can, no 
acid will be present and the soda should be omitted and 3 tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder used instead. 

Pastry. — Pastry is a stiff dough with a large proportion 
of shortening, and is flaky when baked rather than porous. 
Pastry and pies should not be used as a staple food, but when 
well made and properly masticated, pies may be eaten oc- 
casionally by people in good health. The crust should be 
flaky, and thoroughly baked. 



Laboratory management. — Effective work in batters cannot be accom- 
plished with less than J cup liquid, though a smaller portion is sometimes 
used. It is well to have some group work, so that the pupils may learn to 
beat larger quantities. If there is a, school lunch room, large quantities 
may be utilized there.

2. Method of mixing for all. 

Have all the ingredients and utensils icy cold. Mix the dry 
ingredients and cut in the fat with two knives. Stir in the ice . 
water until the dough will just hold together. Toss upon a 
floured board and roll to f inch or less in thickness. Roll this 
up. If not ready to be used, this pie crust may be covered 
'with moist cheesecloth and put on the ice until wanted. This 
amount of crust will make two medium-sized pies with two 
crusts each. 

3. Method of shaping. 

For plain crust. — Cut off f of the roll of crust. Roll out 
to about | inch thickness. Have a deep dish ready contain- 
ing either the apple or meat fillings (see recipes below) and 
with the edge of dish buttered. Invert a small cup in the 
center of the dish to hold up the crust if apples are used. 
Lay the rolled-out crust over the top, having rolled it a little 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 185 

larger than the dish. Turn under the edges of the crust and 
crimp them down on the dish. Make several small cuts in the 
top of the crust to let the steam escape. Bake in a moderate 
oven until the filling (if apples) is cooked and the crust brown. 

For short crust. — Cut off I of the roll of crust and roll out 
very thin, keeping the shape round. Line a buttered pie 
plate with the crust. Pill this with the desired filling, moisten 
the edge of bottom crust with water, and cover with another 
round of crust rolled as before. Crimp down the edges of the 
top crust and make cuts in the top as before. Bake until the 
filling is cooked and the crust is brown. 

For rich crust. — Roll the crust to J inch thickness. Have 
ready | cup ice-cold fat. Cut off small bits of this and spread 
it in dabs over the rolled-out crust. Roll this again and then 
proceed as for the " short " crust (2). 

12. Apple pie filling. 

Use juicy, tart apples. Pare, cut in quarters, core, and 
slice apples into pie dish, filling it heaping full. Add | cup 
water and J cup sugar. Any flavor desired may be used, lemon 
rind, or spices. A little butter gives an agreeable flavor. 

13. Lemon pie filling. 

Ingredients. 

1 heaping tablespoonful corn- ( 1 egg whole, or 

starch mixed with j yolks of 2 eggs 

A little cold water Juice and rind of 1 lemon 

Large cup hot water A very little salt . « 

Piece butter the size of walnut Whites of 2 eggs 

1 cup sugar Powdered sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful 

Method. 

Mix the starch with the cold water, add the boiling water 
and cook until it thickens, and add the butter and sugar. 
Beat the egg (or yolks) and add the other ingredients. Add the 
lemon last. When the pie is done, if two yolks were used, beat 
the whites with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, place on the 
top, and brown in a moderate oven.

14. Meat or chicken pie. 

Use left-over, cooked meat. Cut the meat into dice or small 
bits and fill the dish. Sprinkle with salt and moisten with 
gravy, if possible. If not, add 1 cup hot water and dredge 
rightly with flour. Have top crust only.

CHAPTER XII 

YEAST BREAD 

Yeast bread when well made is a food of which the palate 
never tires, and it is usually recognized as a part of every well- 
planned meal. The quick breads are a convenient substi- 
tute at times, but they are not the staff of life in the same 
sense, and are, on the whole, less widely used. 

The making of a perfect loaf, of bread is the goal of all 
those who aspire to excel in cookery; and the art of bread 
making requires not only a clear understanding of the under- 
lying principles, but patience and persistence in experimen- 
tation and practice until a uniformly perfect product is 
achieved. The fact that in yeast we have a living organism 
with which to deal makes the whole process a delicate one, 
in which every detail is of importance, whether it be a matter 
of ingredients, proportions, methods of mixing, or tempera- 
ture. 

The standard of good bread. — There will always be some 
difference of opinion in regard to a desirable quality in bread, 
and individual preference will control the final result, whether 
the crumb of the bread shall be dry and porous or somewhat 
more moist and finer in grain. French bread is of the former 
type, the English preferring a close grain and solid loaf. 
Allowing for these differences, it is still possible to standardize 
bread, and to state in percentages the different points to be 
considered in judging a loaf. 

We must consider the size and symmetry of the loaf, in 
order that the interior of the bread may be baked to the very 

187 



188 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

center, without overbaking or burning the crust, and there- 
fore very large loaves should be avoided. The crust should 
be uniform in color, the shade ranging from a light golden 
to a darker brown, and the quality may be soft or crisp, but 
never tough. The crumb should be light, the cavities evenly 
distributed throughout the loaf and of uniform size. It 
should also be elastic, tender, and yet not pasty, evenly 
baked without streaks and heavy portions near the crust, 
and the color should be creamy rather than a snowy white. 
(Fig. 55.)

Note. — These two score cards are the average of the work of 
sixty students in judging bread in experimental cookery, Depart- 
ment of Foods and Cookery, Teachers College, Columbia Univer- 
sity. See also Bulletin 25, University of Illinois. 

Digestibility and nutritive value. — Bread of the standard 
described is readily digestible when at least twelve hours old 
and stands high in nutritive value. Figure 51 compares 
the composition of several varieties. 

Like the cereals, it has considerable protein, and some fat, 
but is highest in starch. The white bread, unless made with 
milk, has very little ash. A slice almost one inch thick 
weighing 1.38 ounces, from a baker's five-cent loaf, will yield 
100 Calories. 

The cost of bread. — The table in Chapter XVII states 
the amount of protein and energy obtained for ten cents from 
bread as compared with other common foods, and makes the 
fact clear that bread is essentially one of the cheapest foods, 
remaining relatively so whatever the general fluctuations in 
food prices may be. 

A pound loaf of bread at the bakery should cost five cents, 
the cost being slightly less when the bread is made at home, 
even taking the fuel into account. It is an open question, 
however, whether bread should be made at home or bought 
at the bakery, all the circumstances being weighed in the 
balance by the individual. (See Chapter XVII.) In America, 
we need to learn to dictate and control the methods in the 



YEAST BREAD 191 

public bakeries because bakers' bread is being used more and 
more, although it is said that 50 per cent is still made at 
home. If bread is to be bought, it is necessary for the house- 
keeper to understand the bread-making process and the 
standard of good bread that she may criticize intelligently, 
and force the public bakeries to furnish bread made under 
ideal conditions. Such bread is supplied in France, where 
the housekeepers in the city, though noted for their 
thrift, do not think of bread making at home as a practical 
or economical procedure. It must be understood that the 
baker's oven is fitted to do better work than the small oven 
of the average kitchen, and if the public through laws and in- 
spection will control the quality of the materials used and 
the cleanliness of the process, baker's bread will be a useful 
" ready-cooked " food. 

The ingredients of bread. — The essential ingredients are 
flour, water, and yeast. The liquid may be milk, or milk 
and water, the milk changing the flavor slightly and increas- 
ing the nutritive value, while the cream in the milk increases 
the tenderness of the crumb and crust. The non-essentials 
include salt to develop flavor, sugar sometimes added to 
hasten fermentation and also for flavor, and a fat to increase 
tenderness, as, for instance, butter or some cheaper fat. 
Spices and dried fruits are used in sweet breads, and when 
eggs are added sweet bread becomes a plain cake having a 
delicious and characteristic flavor. 

The characteristics of good flour. — The average com- 
position of flour is as follows : 

Protein . H-4 per cent 

Fat . . .... 1.0 " 

Carbohydrate . ... 75.1

The protein occurs in the form of gluten, which has the; 
property of stretching and expanding, and which makes the 
framework of the loaf of bread, since it retains the air and 
carbon dioxide, and hardens when baked. The protein of 
oats and corn lacks this property, and therefore oatmeal and 
corn meal give a very different type of bread. Rye flour

size of the loaf. 



contains gluten, and the rye loaf therefore resembles the 
wheat loaf. Wheat and flour differ largely on account of 
the difference in the amount of gluten, and the gluten itself 
varies in quality with the variety of wheat. 

Figure 52 shows the result of an experiment with flour 
made from different kinds of wheat, all the other factors in 
the bread making being identical. This effect of the differ- 
ence in the composition of the flour is very striking. Again, 
the same variety of wheat will differ from season to season, 



YEAST BREAD

and the time of planting, also, affects the quality of the 
grain. The time of planting and reaping gives us two classes 
of wheat and flour, the winter and spring. Winter wheat 
is sown in the fall and obtains its first growth before winter, 
living through the winter in those latitudes where the climate 
is sufficiently mild, being harvested in early summer. Spring 
wheat is sown in the spring and harvested late and it is the 
wheat of the great flour-producing state, Minnesota. The 
difference in the composition of the two wheats is shown in 
this table. 1

Note that the spring wheat contains more protein and there- 
fore more gluten. The flour from spring wheat is creamy in 
color,* granular to the touch, has more gluten, and is known 
as a strong flour. Flour from winter wheat is somewhat whiter 
in color and smoother to the touch, feeling more like corn- 
starch, and if a portion is squeezed in the hand, it retains 
the imprint of the fingers. It has less gluten, more starch, 
and is known as a soft flour. This type of flour is some- 
times called " pastry flour," the smaller percentage of gluten 
making it more desirable for pastry or cake than the stronger 
flour. 

Flour manufacturers and bakers are constantly experi- 
menting to find the best possible varieties and combinations 
of varieties for bread flour. Some difference of opinion exists, 

1 U. S. Department of Agriculture, Farmers' Bulletin 389, p. 16. 
o 



194 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



but a combination of winter and spring wheat in flour is 
considered the best for bread by some authorities. 

We must learn to like a creamy color in bread, for this 
means the presence of more gluten. To summarize : a good 
bread flour contains a large percentage of gluten, is creamy 
in color, and granular to the touch.' 

Manufacture of flour. — Modern machinery has taken the 
place of the old-time stones in the grinding of flour, although 

the two main divisions of the 
process remain the same, these 
being the crushing of the grain 
and the sifting out of the coarse 
portion. Milling now includes 
many stages in the process not 
possible with the cruder ma- 
chinery of former times, and the 
present effects a greater number 
of separations and permits the 
miller to make a greater variety 
of products. 

Figure 53 shows a dissected 
kernel of wheat, with its five 
layers of bran. Within these at 
B is a shell of glutinous matter, 
yellowish and of flinty hardness, 
and within this, but not sharply 
divided from it, lie the starch granules in a network of woody 
fiber, the germ lying at A. The milling process must remove 
the bran coats and the germ, and crush and roll the remain- 
ing portions to the necessary fineness. The germ if allowed 
to remain affects the color and keeping properties. The 
breaking and rolling are accomplished by steel machinery, 
and the final sifting is done through silk bolting cloth. By

the new machinery about 70 per cent of the wheat is saved 
for food, 30 per cent being bran, "shorts," and other by- 
products used chiefly for cattle feeding. 

Figure 54 shows the vertical section of a mill, simplified 
in the drawing that all the steps of the process may be clear. 
The diagram does not, of course, show the actual arrange- 
ment of the mill. 1 

The typical parts in a modern flour mill are as follows : 
(1) Scales, for weighing wheat as it is received. (2) Receiv- 
ing separator, for separating other kinds of seeds from wheat. 
(3) Storage bins, for reserve supply of wheat in advance of 
mill requirements. (4) Mill separator, for further separating 
foreign seeds from wheat. (5) Scourer, for removing dust 
from wheat kernels. (6) Cockle cylinder, for removing all 
round seeds. (7) Wheat washer, for thoroughly cleansing 
the wheat. (8) Wheat dryer, for drying wheat after washing. 
(9) 1st break rolls, for rupturing bran, enabling bran and 
germ to be separated from interior. (10) 1st break scalper, 
for sifting middlings through bolting cloth to separate from 
bran. (11) 2d break rolls, for further loosening the mid- 
dlings from bran. (12) 2d break scalper, for separating 
more middlings from bran. (13) 3d break rolls, for further 
loosening middlings from bran. (14) 3d break scalper, for 
final separation of middlings from bran. (15) Bran duster, 
for dusting low grade flour from bran. (16) Bran bin, for 
packing bran for shipment. (17) Grading reel, for separating 
middlings by sifting through various sizes of bolting cloth. 
(18) Dust collector and purifier, for cleaning anci purifying 
middlings by air and sifting. (19) Smooth rolls, for grinding 
purified middlings very fine to flour. (20) Flour bolter, for 
sifting flour from purified middlings. (21) 2d reduction

Other forms of flour. — • There has been much discussion 
of entire wheat flour versus white flour, and the practical 
conclusions are as follows : the bread from whole wheat 
flour compares favorably with that from white flour (see 
Fig. 51), /but this material is slightly less available for 
digestion than the material of the white flour. The mineral 
content is higher, and when the income is so limited that this 
cannot be furnished in milk, green vegetables, and fruit, 
whole wheat bread should be used. It makes a pleasing 
variety, too, for any table. 

Graham flour is a coarse flour, containing the outer bran. 
It is useful for its effect upon the intestines in case of con- 
stipation, but has to be avoided by some people on account 
of its irritating effect. White flour may have coarser mate- 
rial mixed with it, for variety in bread making, such as rye or 
Indian meal, or graham flour. 

Yeast in bread. — ■ Yeast is put into bread dough in order 
to produce carbon dioxide gas to lighten the whole mass. It 
is studied in the chapter on preservation of fruit, but in 
bread making we need to foster its growth instead of destroy- 
ing it as, you will recall, we found necessary in preserving. 
You can easily reason out for yourself just how this should be 
done, especially after performing the experiments with yeast. 

If yeast is in good condition, it has little effect on the flavor 
of bread, even if used in a rather large quantity to hasten the 
process. 

The best forms of yeast now in use are the compressed 
and dried cakes, the former needing to be fresh, the latter 



198 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

keeping the vitality of the yeast cells for a long time. Liquid 
yeast may be made at home, but it is somewhat uncertain 
unless made with great exactness, and less easy to manage 
on the whole than the other forms. 

Proportions of the ingredients. — ■ One part of water to 
three of flour, or one cup to three of flour for a loaf, is an 
average proportion. The practiced bread maker will vary 
this slightly to suit the variations in the flour from time to 
time, but it is a safe rule for the beginner to follow. Winter 
wheat flour requires somewhat more water than the spring 
wheat, or the blend of the two. Salt should be used sparingly, 
for although it improves the flavor of the loaf, salt is a pre- 
servative which retards or prevents the growth of lower 
organisms, and in the case of bread it acts therefore as a 
check to fermentation. One teaspoonful to a loaf is the 
largest amount that it is best to use. 

The quantity of yeast depends upon several conditions. 
The larger the amount of yeast used, the shorter is the time 
of rising, and as many as two compressed yeast cakes may be 
used to one loaf if it is necessary to hasten the process, with- 
out any perceptible effect on the color, texture or flavor. 
If a very large amount of yeast is used, the bread is 
" crumbly," and a difference in flavor will be noticed. A 
smaller amount may be used if time is allowed for the rising, 
even § cake of compressed yeast to a loaf, if the bread is to 
rise over night in warm weather. It must be remembered 
that, if the rising process is too prolonged, other organisms 
have a chance to work, and the bread may sour. 

A small amount of sugar hastens fermentation, and from 
one to two teaspoonfuls to a loaf may be used. Many 
people prefer the flavor of bread with no sugar, however. 
Some bakers use malt extract both as a yeast food to hasten 
fermentation and for its effect upon the flavor. 



YEAST BREAD

Fat, or shortening, should be sparingly used, not more than 
one or two teaspoonfuls being allowed to a loaf. If you 
study a number of bread recipes, you will see that this in- 
gredient varies more than the others. As a matter of fact, 
if the flour is of good quality and the bread well made, this 
ingredient is not necessary (in loaf bread at least), although 
it seems to improve the quality of biscuit and rolls. 

Methods of mixing and the rising of bread. — ■ Dissolve 
the yeast in a portion of the liquid, stir this mixture into the 
remaining liquid, add half the' flour, and beat the mixture 
thoroughly at this stage. Add the sugar if any is to be used. 
When this soft mixture, called the "sponge," becomes full of 
bubbles, add the salt, the shortening if used, and the remain- 
ing flour. Knead the dough by the hand, or by the machine, 
for about ten minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. 
Put it into a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow the 
dough to remain until it doubles its bulk. Some bread 
makers knead in all the flour at the first, and obtain a good 
result. The first rising is more rapid, however, and expe- 
rience seems to prove that the results are better on the whole 
with the sponge. Cut the dough down, knead again, using 
as little flour as possible. Shape into loaves, place the loaves 
in greased pans, cover, and leave again until the loaves double 
their bulk, when they are ready for baking. If left too long, 
the bubbles of gas become too large. 

Temperature and time are important, in this matter of 
mixing and using. The process may be shortened to five or 
six hours, including the baking, or lengthened to twenty-four 
by the choice of the amount of yeast and the temperature. 
The shorter process is the better, on the whole. After 
reading over the sections of the chapter on preservation of 
fruit, performing the yeast experiments, and discussing the 
results, you will be able to answer these questions : 



YEAST BREAD 201 

1. What should be the temperature of the ingredients when 
the bread is mixed ? 

2. If milk is used, how may the souring of the milk be prevented ? 

3. What temperature will you secure for the bread while it is 
rising ? 

4. If an emergency occurs, and the dough cannot be kneaded 
or baked at the moment it is ready, what can be done? Can you 
think of two expedients? 

A few suggestions. — The kneading stretches the gluten 
and long kneading gives a fine grain. In such a recipe as 
that for the making of Parker House rolls, a very delicate 
quality results from a protracted process ; one old-fashioned 
housekeeper recommends a half hour's kneading three times. 
Fortunately a sufficiently good bread or roll may be made 
by ten or fifteen minutes' kneading at a time. 

Bread dough may be cut or stirred with a large knife in 
place of the kneading, and this is a good method to teach to 
those who live in crowded space and find it difficult to have 
a perfectly clean kitchen and proper utensils. With this 
method the dough must be softer, and it remains in the bowl 
until it is turned into the baking pan. The resulting loaf is 
somewhat moist, and not fine-grained, but the flavor is good. 

Brushing the surface of the dough in the bowl or pan with 
water or milk will prevent the formation of a dry crust on the 
top. 

Baking the bread. — The temperature of the oven should 
be steady, and about 380° F. An authority recommends 
180° C. (355° F.) when the loaf is put in, rising to 220° C. 
(425° F.). 1 The amount of flour for one loaf has been given. 
A loaf this size should be baked in a pan 8| to 9 inches X 
3§ to 4 X 3 to 3|. The material of the pan is not of great 
consequence. Tin gives good results, a longer time being

required for baking in a 
granite pan. A loaf should 
bake about one hour. 
(See Fig. 55.) 

Rolls and biscuit may 
be shaped in many ways. 
(See Fig. 56.) How will 
the baking differ from that 
of the loaf? 

Care of bread after bak- 
ing. — Remove from the 
pans, cool on a rack, place 
in tin box or stone jar, and 
cover with paraffin paper. 

Uses of stale bread. — 
Bread that has become 
too dry may be freshened 
by moistening the surface 
and heating in the oven. 
Bread may be used for 
toast, croutons for soup, 
escalloped dishes, pud- 
dings, crumbs for coating 
other food materials, and 
may be made into cups for 
holding other materials.

10-inch, square of cheesecloth, 
a piece of string, a pan or tin 
or granite plate. 



YEAST BREAD 203 

Method. — Tie the flour in the cheesecloth, and wash it, prefer- 
ably under the faucet, until the starch is washed out. Remove the 
gluten, stretch and knead into a ball. Place the ball on a pan in the 
oven. Note results. Note temperature of oven, if possible. 
B. Experiments with yeast. 

1. Materials, (a) 1 cake of yeast dissolved in J of a cupful 
of lukewarm water with water added to make i cupful, (b) \ cup 
water and \ cup flour stirred together + 1 tablespoonful of molasses. 
Divide this mixture into three parts. 

Method. — Add 2 tablespoonfuls of (a) to each of two thirds of (b). 
Put remaining portion of (a) into a saucepan and bring it to the 
boiling point and then add it to the third part of (b). Number these 
bowls 1, 2, 3. 

(1) Surround bowl No. 1 with lukewarm water and keep the 
water at this temperature by adding warmer water from time to 
time. Note result. 

(2) Surround bowl No. 2 with cracked ice and salt. Note result. 

(3) Surround bowl No. 3 with lukewarm water as in No. 1. 
Note result. 

(4) Before the end of the hour remove bowl No. 2 from the ice 
water and surround it with water at 100° P. and watch results.

7. Toast. — Directions for making toast will be found in Chapter 
IV. 

To serve toast. — Toast should be served as soon as it is made, 
if possible, and if not must be kept hot. Fold it in a napkin. 
Toast may also be buttered, piled neatly on a plate, and kept 
hot in the oven until it is time for serving. 

For milk toast the bread is cut somewhat thicker than for 
buttered toast. The milk is prepared by thickening, No. 1 under 
White Sauce. Dip each slice of toast in the thickened milk 
and then put the slices in a dish for serving and pour the thick- 
ened milk over. To moisten toast that is too dry, or when 
moist toast is wanted to serve under some other food, place it 
in a steamer or colander over boiling water a few minutes be- 



Laboratory management. — For individual work or for work in groups of 
two, the use of 5 cup of liquid will be found to make as small an amount 
of dough as it is desirable to handle. In making the white bread two por- 
tions may be baked in one tin, brushing with butter where the two por- 
tions touch each other, so that the loaves will separate when baked. 

Where it is necessary to hurry the process not less than ^ yeast cake 
should be used with this quantity. 

It is impossible in an ordinary school period to complete the entire pro- 
cess. A number of solutions will occur to the teacher. One of these is to 
arrange the lessons as follows : 

Lesson I. 

Yeast experiments, summary, bread .mixed in groups and set to rise, 
demonstration by teacher of kneading, using dough previously prepared. 

Lesson II.

kneaded, shaped and set to rise by pupils. Review of yeast experiments. 
Baking of bread. 

Lesson III.

fore buttering it. This is much better than toast moistened 
with boiling water. 

8. The sandwich. — The sandwich is a convenient way of serving 

bread and other foods away from the table, for picnics, teas, 
and receptions. 

To prepare the bread. — Either white or brown bread may 
be used. Select a well-shaped loaf of fine grain that will not 
crumb when it is sliced. Cut off the end of the loaf, spread 
the loaf evenly with butter, cut a thin slice, butter again, and 
so on. The butter should be softened. Be careful to spread 
it evenly and see that it is near the edge of the bread. Sand- 
wiches may be made either with or without the crust. If the 
crust is to be removed, cut it off the loaf before buttering and 
slicing. 

The filling. — There is an endless variety of filling pos- 
sible for sandwiches, from slices of meat and poultry, which 
make a substantial luncheon for picnics, to the dainty fillings 
used for afternoon teas and receptions. A crisp bit of lettuce 
leaf with Mayonnaise dressing is always acceptable. Cream 
cheese mixed with nuts and raisins is a good filling. For a 
sweet sandwich, jam or jelly may be spread on the slices and 
possibly a small amount of cream cheese put between. You 
can invent many combinations. 

The shape of the sandwich may be oblong, triangular, or round. 
The round sandwich is cut with a sharp cooky cutter. The 
pieces remaining may be dried and used for bread crumbs. 
The crusts may always be utilized in this way. 

9. Croutons. — Cut a slice of bread a day old i inch thick. Spread 

with soft butter, cut off the crust, put the slices in a pan, 
cut in cubes and set the pan in the oven until the croutons are 
brown.

CHAPTER XIII 



MEATS AND POULTRY 

The meats that we commonly use are derived from the 
flesh of domestic and wild animals of herbiverous habits 
and from fowls. The flesh of carnivorous 
animals is seldom used as food. The vari- 
ous kinds are obtained as follows : 



Meat 


Animal 


Beef 


Ox 


Veal 


Calf 


Mutton 


Sheep 


Lamb 


Young sheep 


Pork 


Pig 


Ham and bacon 


Pig 


Venison 


Deer 




Under the head of poultry we include the 
common fowl, turkeys, ducks and geese, 
the guinea hen, and game birds. 

Quality of good meat. — • The quality of 
meat is dependent on the condition of the 
animal from which it is derived. The crea- Fig. 57 
ture should be in perfect health and well 
fed. Good beef is largely obtained from 
the cattle ranges of the West, but there is no reason why 
cattle should not be raised to greater extent in the East. 
Sheep for mutton are best raised where the climate is not 
too severe. Methods of slaughter, transportation, and pres- 
p 209

ervation all affect the quality of beef. The pure food laws 
and Federal meat inspection law are valuable to the consumer 
in their control of the quality of the meat, that it shall be 
free from disease and from adulterations. See Chapter XVII 
for the discussion of preservatives and pure food laws.

In meat as it is purchased we have bone, fat, and the 
flesh, consisting of the muscle of the animal with its con- 
nective tissue. The color of the meat should be clear and 
fairly bright, not purplish or dull. There should be little 
or no odor, and the meat should be firm and elastic to the 
touch. 

Beef should be a bright red and well streaked with fat. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 



211 



Veal should be pink and is some- 
what less firm than beef If watery 
and flabby, it is too young. 

Mutton is a duller red, and firm. 
The fat is white or slightly yellow 
and hard. 

Lamb is pink, rather than red, 
and slightly less firm. 

Pork is rather pale, somewhat 
less firm than beef and mutton, and 
the fat is softer. 

Tough, and tender meat. — To 
understand the difference between 
the tough and tender cuts we must 
be familiar with the structure of the 
muscle (see Fig. 57). Each muscle 
consists of bundles of Tubes held 
together by connective tissue. In 
tough meat, the muscle tubes are 
thicker and there is more connective 
tissue present. Exercise strength- 
ens the muscle, and this accounts 
for the fact that the unexercised 
muscles of the young animal give 
us a softer meat. In the mature 
animal the muscles most exercised 
furnish the tough meat, and the 
less used muscles the tender. If

come from the neck and legs, the tender cuts from the middle

of the back, the toughness increasing as the cuts approach 
the neck and the hind legs. The_ muscles of the abdomen 
are also tender, but they give a coarse-grained meat. The 
-"various cuts of meat are shown as they occur in the standing 
animal in Fig. 58, and in the hind and fore quarters hanging, in 
Figs. 59 and 60. The individual cuts of beef and mutton are 
shown in the figures that follow. The tender cuts from the 
ribs and loin are the most highly prized, and therefore bring 
the highest price. These cuts are liked because of their ten- 
derness although the nutritive value of J;he tough meatus as 
high or possibly even higher than that of the tender. All 
meat is now nigh priced, and you will find the reasons for 
this discussed in Chapter XVII. For the sake of economy we 
are forced to use the relatively cheaper cuts, and to seek for 
meat substitutes. We must also take pains to use the cook- 
ing processes that will make the tough meats palatable. 

Composition and nutritive value. — Figure 64 shows you 
the composition of several common meats. Meat is valuable 
chiefly for its protein, fat, and mineral salts. The juices of 
the meat in the muscle cells contain nitrogenous extractive 
materials which give flavor, and are possibly stimulating, 
but they have no food value. From the bone and also from 
the connective tissue, gelatin is dissolved in cooking. Gela- 
tin is a protein, but differs in certain chemical properties 
from other proteins, and cannot be used as the only source of 
nitrogen. It is a very useful protein, however, and as it can 
be substituted in part for more expensive proteins, it used 
to be called a " protein saver." 

In spite of the fact that meat is a common article of diet 
it should not be used in excess. Other forms of protein, as 
those in eggs and milk, are usually digested as easily, and 
most people can digest vegetable proteins if the vegetables 
are carefully prepared. Very little children should not have 



214 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT

216 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

meat, for it has stimulating properties which are undesirable 
for them, and it takes away the taste for foods more important 
for growth (see Food for Growth, Chapter XVIII). When 
used largely in the diet, meat tends to cause intestinal putf e- - 
faction and to form excess of acid in the body. It is less 
likely to be harmful if taken with plenty of fruits and green 
vegetables and liberal drinking of clear water. 

It should be realized that in none of the European coun- 
tries is meat used so liberally as in the United States, and 
that there are reasons to believe that we might be better off 
if we could satisfy ourselves with a meat consumption nearer 
the average of other civilized peoples — say half as much 
meat per person per year as we are now accustomed to use. 
The fuel value of meat depends largely upon the amount of 
fat which is eaten. If a pound of steak contains 2 ounces of 
fat and 14 ounces of clear lean, the rejection of the fat means 
a loss of fully one half of the fuel value. The following table 
shows the difference between raw meat of the same cut, free 
from bones and connective tissue, due to differences in amounts 
of fat. Most people would prefer the strictly lean meat.

Dangers from meat. — Three dangers from meat must be 
recognized ; (1) animal parasites, such as the trichina some- 
times found in pork, (2) poisons developed in the meat by 
bacteria when it is kept too long or without sufficient refrigera- 
tion, this danger being recognized as ptomaine poisoning, 
(3) bacteria, sometimes present in meat, which are directly 
injurious to man and which are now held to be the cause of 
most of the sickness commonly attributed to ptomaine 
poisoning. Government protection must be given us here, 
but the housekeeper too has a responsibility. If the raw meat 
has failed to receive proper inspection, we can protect our- 
selves by cooking the meat to a degree that will kill any 
parasite present. For this reason meat should not be served 
that looks raw or too underdone. The cooked meat should 
be pink rather than red. 

Meat poisoning may be avoided in the first place by exer- 
cising great care in regard to the odor of meat. Meat may 
hang to " ripen," as the butchers say, but one must learn to 
distinguish between the odor of properly ripened meat, and 
that of even slightly tainted meat. Quite as important is 
the rapid cooling of meat, poultry, fish, and soups that are 
not to be used at once. Cases of digestive disturbance and 
even actual poisoning sometimes occur when underdone 
meat, especially lamb, veal, or poultry, remains warm over- 
night. 

The effect of heat upon meat. — The fat of meat is 
melted by heat. The meat fiber shrinks and hardens

with intense heat; on the other hand it softens at a 
temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water. 
The structure of the muscle must be studied further in order 
to make the principles of cooking perfectly clear. If you 
think of the structure of the muscle cell as somewhat 
resembling the structure of an orange, you can picture quite 
clearly what happens under different conditions. Open a 
section of orange and separate some of the single cells. These 
may represent the muscle cells of meat that can be seen only 
under the microscope. If you cut across one of these tiny 
cells, the contents will escape, and this is what happens when 
the muscle cells are cut across. Then, too, if the muscle is 
heated, the juices will pass through the membrane of the 
cell, and this happens, too, if the meat is put into cold water. 
The substances in the juices of the meat which are not 
coagulated by heat are called the extractives, because they 
can be extracted by hot water. The most valuable protein 
matter remains behind in the muscle cell, however. Among 
these proteins are those known as meat albumin, and this 
behaves in cooking very much as does the white of egg, — ■ 
that is to say, it coagulates. 

Bearing these facts in mind, we can decide just what to do 
in order to bring about the result that we desire in meat 
cookery, for sometimes we wish to extract the juices and 
sometimes we wish to have all, or nearly all, retained in the 
meat. We are now ready to state the principles of meat 
cookery as follows : 

1. Juices retained. 

In broiling, pan broiling, roasting, and boiling the high 
temperature coagulates the meat albumin and hardens the 
fiber on the surface, thus forming a coating which prevents 
the further escape of juices. In the roasting and boiling of 



MEATS AND POULTRY 221 

large pieces the temperature may then be lowered to pre- 
vent the further shrinking and hardening of the fiber in the 
interior of the meat, which comes from a protracted high 
temperature. With a very thick steak after the surface 
searing the cooking may be completed in the oven. 

2. Juices extracted. 

In beef juice or beef tea, this may be made by placing 
the chopped beef in a jar and placing the jar in an oven, or 
in hot water ; or for beef tea and ordinary soup by putting 
the chopped meat, or small pieces of meat, in cold water and 
heating the water slowly. 

3. Juices partly retained and partly extracted. 

This is desirable in stews, in braised beef, and in pot roast. 
State for yourself just how this would be accomplished. 

4. Connective tissue softened at low temperature, and with 

water. 

5. Sterilization by continued heat which destroys parasites 

and bacteria. 

6. Rapid cooling, when serving is not immediate. 

Flavors suitable with meat. 

Herbs. All the pot herbs including savory, marjoram, thyme, 
sage, pot marigold. 

Vegetables. Onion, carrot, turnip, celery, celery root, parsley 
root and leaf. 

Spices. Clove, allspice, mustard, red, black, and white pepper. 
Some nationalities use nutmeg. 

Acids. Lemon, tomato, and other acid fruits. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

/ 

' Experiment A. 

Chop finely a small piece of meat, squeeze out the juice with a 
lemon squeezer and heat this juice in a saucepan. Observe the 
coagulation that takes place. 



222 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Experiment B. 

(1) Apparatus. — If possible, 2 glass beakers, 1 square wire 
net. If these are not available, use an ordinary tumbler and a 
small saucepan. 

(2) Method. — a. Put a small piece of meat in a beaker with 
cold water, and allow it to stand. 

6. Bring water to the boiling point in the beaker on the net 
over the gas flame. Throw in a small piece of meat. 

Compare the appearance of the two pieces of meat and the water 
in the two beakers. 

i. Broiled steak. — (1) Wipe steak with a damp cloth. If a wood 
or coal stove is used, have a bed of glowing coals ready. If 
gas is used, have the gas broiler thoroughly heated. Grease 
the bars of the broiler. Place steak in the broiler and sear meat 
first on one side, then on the other. Continue to turn the 
broiler and cook the meat until it is brown and done according 
to taste. Steak an inch thick will take about ten minutes to 
be cooked to a medium degree. Chops are broiled in the same 
way. 

(2) Steak and chops may also be broiled in the pan. An 
iron frying pan is the best utensil. Heat the pan, and brush 
it over with a small piece of fat cut from the steak or the 
chops. The purpose of this is merely to keep the meat from 
sticking to the pan. The principle of procedure is the same as 
with (1). The steak or chops must be frequently turned, 
using a knife and a fork, being careful not to prick the meat 
with the fork. The length of time is slightly longer than 
for (1). This method must not be confused with the frying 
of steak in a pan with a large amount of fat. By this method 
the steak is not fried, and it is often a convenient substitute 
for (1). 

2. Roast of beef . — Wipe roast with a damp cloth. Sprinkle with 
salt and dredge with flour. Place in a roasting pan, fat side 
up if it is a standing roast. Put the roast in a very hot 
oven and after fifteen minutes reduce the heat. Baste roast 
two or three times with the fat that tries out during cooking. 
The usual allowance of time for a medium rare roast is fifteen 
minutes for every pound of meat. 

Boast beef gravy. — After the roast has been taken from the 



MEATS AND POULTRY 223 

pan, pour out all but 1J tablespoonfuls of the melted fat. Stir 
in 1 heaping tablespoonful of flour and brown very slightly. 
Add one cup of cold water and stir constantly until thickened. 
Add § teaspoonful salt. Strain. 

3. Bouillon. 

Shin of beef 6 pounds Parsley 2 sprigs 

Cold water 3 quarts Carrot ] 

Peppercorns \ teaspoonful Turnip i cup each 

Cloves 6 Onion cut in dice 



Bay leaf J Celery 

Thyme 3 sprigs Salt 1 tablespoonful 

Marjoram 1 sprig 

Wipe beef and cut the lean meat in inch cubes. Brown one 
third of the meat in fat cut from meat or marrow from a mar- 
row bone. Put remaining two thirds with bone and fat in 
soup kettle, add water and let stand for thirty minutes. Place 
on back of range, add browned meat, and heat gradually to 
the boiling point. Cover and cook slowly six hours, keeping 
below the boiling point during cooking. Add the vegetables 
and seasonings, cook one and one half hours, strain and cool as 
quickly as possible. This is called soup stock. 

To clarify bouillon. — When stock is cold, remove fat 
which has hardened on top and put quantity to be cleared into

stock. Put over fire and stir constantly until boiling point

. General directions for meat soups. — Soup making is an art that 
is well worth cultivating. The expert soup maker will obtain 
delicious flavors by adding bits of many kinds of left overs — 
almost anything that is found in the refrigerator in the way of 
fruit, vegetables, and pieces of meat. With the coming of the 
gas stove, many people have given up soup making. These 
various left overs add much to the flavor of the soup and 
can be used in a thickened soup which is like the bouillon 
strained and thickened. The thickening may be flour, arrow- 
root, cold cereal, sago, tapioca, or rice. Spaghetti, vermicelli, 



224 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and fancy forms of paste are sometimes served. Vegetables 
may be cut into dice or fancy shapes and served in the clear 
soup. A great variety is possible in flavoring and serving soup 
if one will take the trouble to make it an art. 

Soup meat may be served in a soup of the old-fashioned 
kind, thickened and containing vegetables. In such a soup some 
fat is left, and the total result is a dish that makes a meal when 
served with bread. 

When the soup is a clear soup, the meat that is left may be 
used for made over dishes ; although some practical house- 
keepers think that it costs almost as much to make it palatable 
as to buy fresh meat. Try it in an escalloped dish with plenty 
of tomato, onion, and some dried herbs for additional flavor.

Potatoes 4 cups, cut in \ inch shoes 

Turnip 1 f cup each, cut in half inch 

Carrot J cubes 

Onion I small one, cut in' thin

Wipe meat, cut in 1J inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and dredge with flour. Cut some of the fat in small 
pieces and try out in frying pan. Add meat and stir con- 
stantly, that the surface may be quickly seared. When well 
browned, put in kettle, and rinse frying pan with boiling water, 
that none of the flavor may be lost. Cover with boiling water 
and boil five minutes, then cook below the boiling point until 
meat is tender (about 3 hours). Add vegetables except potatoes 
and seasoning the last hour of cooking. Parboil potatoes five 
minutes and add to stew 15 minutes before taking from fire. 



Teacher's Note. — Broiled steak would be suitable for group work, 
using small steaks (Delmonico cut). A small roast may be prepared by a 
group and roasted after class. This meat and that left from the steak should 
be used in a subsequent class for a lesson on left over meat. Broiled or 
pan-broiled chops may be prepared individually.

7. Uses of left over meat. 

(1) Rissoles. — Run meat together with small piece of onion 
through a chopper. Add salt, pepper, a little cold cereal, 
or bread crumbs, and beaten egg, allowing one egg to about a 
pound of meat. Shape into flat round cakes, roll in flour and 
saute in butter until well browned. These may be served 
with tomato sauce.

This is a simple method of serving left over meat that needs 
no specific recipe. Layers of bread crumbs are alternated with 
layers of meat which may be chopped or cut into small pieces. 
Liquid may be used like tomato or tomato juice, or soup that 
is left over, or plain water. The flavor may be varied by the 
use of the different materials that are suitable to meat. Layers 
of mashed potato may be used instead of bread. 

Poultry 

In selecting poultry see that the flesh is firm, that there is 
a good amount of fat underneath the skin, and that the skin 
is whole and a good yellow. Notice the odor of the fowl 
particularly. The skin of cold-storage poultry has not such 
a good color and is sometimes broken. Often the flesh is 
shrunken, and if the cold storage has been too long continued 
the odor is unpleasant. Refrigeration is allowable for a 
period. Another way to judge cold-storage poultry is by 



MEATS AND POULTRY 227 

the price. Well-fed poultry freshly killed brings a high 
market price and a bargain quite often proves to be poultry 
too long in cold storage. Good quality poultry is at present 
a high-priced food. 

To prepare poultry for cooking, the " dressing " of the 
chicken is often done now at the market. If it is necessary 
to do this at home, make an incision with a sharp knife just 
inside of one of the legs, in the groin.' Insert the hand and 
remove all the entrails. The skin must be loosened at the 
neck and the crop removed. In any case, wash the chicken 
thoroughly inside and out, even holding the cavity under 
running water. If there is hair remaining on the chicken, 
singe this off over burning paper or over a gas flame. 

The composition is essentially the same as that of meat. 
The white of chicken, fowls, and turkeys is thought to be 
more digestible than the dark meat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The principles of cookery are the same as with the meat. Chicken 
soup is made on the same principle as beef soup. After straining, 
it is delicious with the addition of milk or cream. The meat of the 
chicken may be chopped fine and used as a thickening. Rice may 
be added or a hard-boiled egg chopped fine. 

Chicken may be served cold, for luncheon or supper, and is 
always very desirable in made-over dishes. Any stuffing left over 
may be used in the made dishes. 

i. Roast chicken. — Dress and clean a chicken. Fill the cavity with 
stuffing and sew edges together. Truss chicken and place on 
its back in a roasting pan. Rub surface with salt and spread 
breast and legs with butter. Dredge with flour. Put a little 
water in bottom of pan. Place in hot oven and when flour is 
well browned, reduce the temperature. Baste frequently during 
roasting with liquid in pan. When breast meat is tender and 
a brown crust formed the bird is cooked. A four-pound chicken 
requires about 1$ hours. 



228 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Stuffing. (See recipe for stuffing, page 237.) 

Mix all together. No moisture need be added as the 
juices of the chicken will be sufficient. 

Gravy. — Pour off liquid from pan in which chicken has 
beenroasted. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of either chicken fat or 
butter. Stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and let bubble 
up. Add one cup stock, in which giblets, neck, and tips 
of wings have been cooked, and stir steadily until thick- 
ened. Add J teaspoonful salt. 

2. Chicken fricassee. — Clean and cut up a fowl. Cover with 
boiling water and let boil 5 minutes. Simmer until meat is 
tender. Remove chicken from kettle and place pieces in hot, 
greased frying pan. Saute until browned. Put on platter. 
Melt 4 tablespoonfuls chicken fat in pan. Add 4 tablespoon- 
fuls flour. Stir and let bubble up. Add 2 cups chicken 
stock, stir and let boil until thickened. Pour over chicken 
on platter. 

Preserved meats and poultry. — Smoked and salted meats 
are valuable foods, although the nutritive content is some- 
what less available for digestion. The salted and smoked 
meats need long and slow cooking below the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

Canned meats and poultry of good quality are now in the 
market, and they are convenient and useful when not 
used to excess. Buy well-known brands. The govern- 
ment inspection of canned meats is of great importance, 
for the individual cannot protect himself. Canned soups 
are convenient for those who cook by gas and who live 
in small quarters. Buy good brands even if they are some- 
what more expensive. The best firms manufacturing canned 



Laboratory management. — A lesson on poultry is a very expensive one and 
difficult to manage so that each may have a share of the work. Such a lesson 
is suitable where the pupils have had work in previous years and are used to 
working in groups. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 229 

soup are scrupulously clean in their methods and pride 
themselves on using good material. 

Other parts of meat and poultry. — Some of the internal 
organs of the animals and fowl are used for food. Most 
of them are comparatively cheap, and may be made palat- 
able. 

The liver and kidneys are organs having to do with the waste 
products of the body and objection is raised to their use on that ac- 
count. If used, they should be soaked in cold salted water, put 
into fresh cold water, and allowed to heat very slowly. This 
water should be poured off, and then a brown stew can be made. 
What flavors are pleasant with liver and kidneys? 

Make your own recipe for liver or kidney stew. 

The heart does not contain waste products. Why is it tough? 
What process would you select to make it tender? Even when 
softened, it would not be attractive or very palatable without 
further treatment. It is hollow, somewhat as the chicken is before 
roasting. Look over the recipes and flavors suitable to meat and 
see if you cannot make your own for Baked Heart. 

Sweetbreads, the pancreas, are highly prized on account of their 
delicacy, and are costly. They may be broiled, or served in sauce 
in pastry cases or in patties. 

Calf's head and brain. — The brain is sometimes used as substi- 
tute for sweetbreads. From the meat and bones of the head soup 
and stew may be made.

CHAPTER XIV 
FISH, SHELLFISH, AND OTHER MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Fish and shellfish are valuable assets as food, so much so 
that the government has a Bureau of Fisheries, and has es- 
tablished stations at intervals on the coast and on inland 
lakes for the study and production of those foods that come 
from salt and fresh water. We have used these products of 
the waters as if the supply were limitless, forgetting that fish 
and shellfish are living creatures with habits that we cannot 
ignore without working havoc to the species. Young salmon 
and shad are hatched in the upper reaches of the rivers, and 
if we insist on trapping the mature fish at the river mouth on 
their northern migrations, the number of young decreases, 
and salmon and shad become high-priced foods. To ignore 
fishery and game laws is an ignorant and dishonest proceed- 
ing, with far-reaching economic results. 

Varieties of fish. — In Bulletin No. 28 of the Office of 
Experiment Stations, United States Department of Agri- 
culture, forty-four different fish are listed, all used as food. 
A visit to the fish stall in the market of a seaboard city will 
acquaint you with many interesting species. Fresh and salt 
water fish differ in flavor, and there is a difference to be de- 
tected between fish from running, or from lake water, brook 
trout, for instance, having a superior flavor. The food supply 
also influences the flavor, and both fresh and salt water fish 
have a better flavor when taken from sandy and rocky 
bottoms rather than muddy. The habit of the fish also has

FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 233 

an effect on the quality and taste. The chequit, for instance, 
is so sluggish and easy to catch that it is sometimes called 
" lazy " or " weakfish," and it is watery and poor flavored 
compared with the shad, a fish of more vigorous habits. The 
amount of fat also causes a difference in flavor, such high 
flavored fish as salmon and shad containing much fat. The 
distinctive flavors of mackerel and herring are apparently not 
due to fat, since their fat content is not particularly high. 
Among the most common and best liked fish are bass, black- 
fish, bluefish, cod, flounder, haddock, halibut, herring, 
mackerel, porgy (sometimes called scup or scuppaug), 
salmon, shad, smelt, weakfish, whitefish. Brook trout and 
salmon trout are luxuries. 

Composition and nutritive value. — Figure 65 shows the 
composition of several kinds. Compare their composition 
with that of meat. The nutritive content is high, yet fish 
seems a lighter and less satisfying food than meat, although 
on the seaboard of some countries it is the chief animal food. 
The digestibility of fish and meat are about equal, but some 
varieties of fish are less digestible than others, this being 
true of the oily and strong-flavored fish, — herring, mackerel, 
salmon, and shad. 

There are popular prejudices for and against fish that are 
not warranted. The idea that fish is a " brain food " be- 
cause it contains phosphorus was exploded long since, for 
fish contains no more phosphorus than some other foods, 
and phosphorus is no more valuable to the brain than to the 
other tissues. 

Fish, however, is valuable in the dietary for supplying 
protein and giving variety, and in season, it is one of the 
cheaper foods. 

Quality of fish. — Fish deteriorates and decomposes much 
more rapidly than meat, and is at its best when cleaned and 



234 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cooked just after being caught. Ice will preserve fish for a 
short time only. If ever on a camping trip you have eaten 
bluefish caught in the surf, or trout from the brook, cooked 
immediately, you know what flavor a fish may have. Fish 
should be killed immediately, and put on ice if they are 
not to be cooked at once. If there is no ice, clean the fish, 
sprinkle the flesh with pepper and salt, wrap in a wet cloth, 
and set in a breeze or draught. 

When fish are transported over long distances they should be 
packed in ice in refrigerator cars, and you will notice that the 
fishman in the shop keeps the fish on ice until he sells 
them. 

In selecting fish, see that the flesh feels firm and that the 
eyes are still bright, If you have a keen sense of smell, 
this will also guide you, although to the novice the odor of 
fish may be disagreeable even if untainted. 

Fish in season and caught plentifully near by, are of good 
quality and should be cheap. Shad and salmon have their 
season in the spring, bluefish come north in the summer, 
sometimes as late as August, porgies are a summer and au- 
tumn fish, and smelt are abundant in the winter. Deep- 
sea fish like cod and halibut have a long season, and may be 
bought at any time. 



GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The scaling and cleaning of fish are important first steps. In the 
city this may be done for you at the market, but sometimes on 
fishing expeditions when you are not a successful fisher you may 
make yourself useful by cleaning the fish. Clean the fish on a 
large piece of paper. Use a sharp strong knife, and rub off the 
scales from the tail to the head. To skin a fish well, you should 
first watch an expert. Cut through the skin of the back and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 235 

abdomen, loosen it at the tail and pull it off. Remove the head, 
open the abdomen, and take out the entrails. Burn the paper 
on which the fish has been cleaned. Fish is boned by slitting the 
flesh down the back, and patiently separating the flesh from the 
side bones, and finally pulling out the spine and attached bones. 
The strong odor of fish clings to everything the fish touches. Wash 
the fish, the knife, and your own hands in cold water and salt. 
Always pour the water in which fish is washed or cooked down the 
sink at once, pour in some salt, and flush the trap with cold water. 
The utensils, and dishes in which fish is served, need very careful 
washing in several waters. 

The connective tissue of fish softens and dissolves more readily 
than does that of meat. Fish varies in the dryness of the flesh, but 
there is no such thing as tough fish, and the texture of the muscles 
is about the same in all parts of the fish, although there is a differ- 
ence in flavor in the dark and white flesh when these both occur. 
On account of this characteristic of the connective tissue the fish 
" falls apart " and our aim must be to prevent this. 

Principles of cooking. 

1. The protein is affected as in all other foods where it occurs. 

2. The fat is melted. 

3. Connective tissue quickly softened. 

To avoid the breaking of the fish it may be wrapped in cloth for 
boiling, and the water should simmer only. The coating of small 
fish or slices of large fish with beaten egg and crumbs tends to hold 
it together. In all cases avoid overcooking. Fish is done when 
a fork easily pierces it and separates the flakes of flesh from the 
bone. 

i. Boiled fish. — Use thick pieces of large fish for boiling, or 
if small fish are used they may be boiled whole. Add salt and 
vinegar to water in proportion of 1 tablespoonful of salt and 
two of vinegar to three quarts of water. Use enough water 
to cover the fish. Wrap the fish in cheesecloth to prevent 
breaking apart, and plunge into boiling water. Do not let 
the water boil after fish is in. The fish is done when the flesh 
leaves the bone or when the flesh flakes apart easily. The usual 
time for a thick piece is 30-40 minutes.

Make as for white sauce, adding the beaten eggs just before 
taking from fire and stirring until well thickened. Add lemon 
juice just before serving. This sauce is suitable for boiled fish and 
vegetables. 

2. Left over fish. — Fish may be picked apart, mixed with cream 
sauce, and served as creamed fish or served as an escallop. 

Escalloped fish. 

2 cups left over fish, picked over and freed of bones. 
1 cup thin white sauce, dried bread crumbs buttered. 

Butter a baking dish and line with crumbs. Add a layer 
of fish, using half, and cover with half the sauce. Cover with 
a layer of crumbs. Add another layer of fish, sauce, and 
crumbs, making this last layer of crumbs quite thick. Place 
in a hot oven and leave until crumbs are brown and fish is 
heated through. 

To butter crumbs. 

Melt a little butter in a saucepan and turn the crumbs 
in, stirring them over and over with a spoon until all the 
crumbs are coated. 

■3. Baked fish. — Almost any medium sized fish is suitable for bak- 
ing. The favorites are bluefish, shad, haddock, and halibut, 
sliced. 

Clean the fish, seeing that all scales are removed. Stuff and 
sew. Shape with skewers to form a letter S and place upright on 
a baking pan or lay fish on side. If the fish is not a fat kind, put 
strips of salt pork over it and in pan or cut gashes in fish and 
lay strips of pork in them. Dredge with flour. Bake one 
hour for a three-pound fish, in a hot oven, basting frequently 
with the tried-out fat. Serve with drawn butter or Hollandaise 
sauce.

the potato is tender. The whole process will take about 20 
minutes. Drain off the water very thoroughly and shake the 
stewpan over the fire to dry the contents. It is very neces- 
sary to have the mixture free from water. Mash and heat 
the mixture in the stewpan, and add the egg. Taste to see 
if more salt is needed, as is sometimes the case. Finish as 
follows :

(6) The same, browning the cakes on a greased pan in the 
oven, or under the gas flame, turning if necessary. 

(c) Shape in balls, place these in a wire frying basket, lower 
the basket into hot fat until the balls brown, lift the basket, 
drain, and drain the balls on paper. Keep hot until it is time 
to serve. 

Shellfish 

The shellfish are of two classes; the mollusks including 
clams, mussels (seldom used in this country), oysters, and 
scallops, and the crustaceans, — lobsters and crabs. None 
of the mollusks have high nutritive value, but they are a 
protein food, and add to the variety of the diet. The com- 
position of the oyster is shown in Fig. 65, and it will be noted 
that the fat percentage is small and the calorie value low. 

The oyster is raised in beds in the ocean, or bays often near 
the river mouth, and it is the neighborhood to the river that 
makes it possible for the oyster to carry germs of contagion, 
particularly of typhoid fever, when city sewage poured into 
the river passes over the oyster bed. Here, too, government 
protection is essential, and this is a matter that has created 
so much excitement that conditions are already improved. 
There is an association of oyster growers who make a point 
of advertising clean oyster beds, and cleanly methods of 
handling and transporting. 

Oysters vary in size and flavor, the flavor seeming to de- 
pend upon the locality. The smaller are sought for serving 
raw, and the medium and larger for cooking. They are sold 
by the measure or number when taken from the shell, the 
latter giving the surer quantity ; and the price is usually one . 
cent apiece. They are in season from September to May. 
The whole flesh of the oyster is soft and edible, even the 
muscle by which it opens and shuts its shell being tender. 

Clams are of two kinds, distinguished differently in differ- 
ent places. They are known as hard and soft, or round and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 239 

long, and in Rhode Island the hard round clam still bears the 
Indian name Quahaug, the soft shell clam being the only 
"clam." 

The long clam lies buried in the soft mud of creeks and 
muddy shores left exposed at low tide, when they are dug by 
hoes from the mud. The round clam lies on the bottom of 
shallow warm waters, and is raked with an implement made 
for the purpose. The round clam is used when very young 
and small in place of raw oysters; but both kinds when 
matured have a tough portion that is not softened in cooking, 
and that is more or less indigestible. The long " neck " 
which protrudes from the shell has to be discarded. 

Both kinds may be roasted in the shell, and are very palat- 
able served hot with melted butter, salt, and pepper. They 
are most commonly used in soups and in chowder. They are 
purchased by the quantity or number, are cheaper than oys- 
ters, and are always in season. 

Scallops, as purchased, are only a part of the animal in the 
shell, consisting solely of the round white muscle which op- 
erates the shell. The escallop, or scallop, is migratory, mov- 
ing by a shooting motion, the mature scallops reaching the 
creeks and shores in the autumn, and though found in so- 
called beds they are not fixtures like the oysters. The flavor 
is sweet, and they have a quality that makes them more or 
less indigestible, especially when fried. They are very 
palatable and more digestible served in a stew made like an 
oyster stew. They are sold by the measure and are cheap 
in season. 

The lobster is now a luxury, for methods of catching in the 
past have made them scarce in their old haunts. The lobster 
is a much more highly developed animal than the mollusk, 
having strong muscles inside its coat of mail, and the flesh 
has a protein content that compares very favorably with 



240 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

meat. When fresh, and not served with rich sauces or eaten 
at irregular hours, it is not especially indigestible, and may- 
be the main dish at luncheon or supper, served simply with 
salt, pepper, and melted butter and not taken with meat 
foods. Its own delicious flavor needs no addition in the way 
of sauces and high seasoning. 

The crab is essentially like the lobster, being smaller, and 
having a sweeter flavor. The soft shell crab is caught just 
as the old shell is shed, and is highly esteemed as a delicacy. 
Both lobsters and crabs are cooked in the shell, and if al- 
lowed to die naturally before cooking they are uneatable. 
They may be purchased alive or cooked, and one is surer of 
their condition when they are bought alive. Twenty-five 
cents a pound is now an average price for lobsters in shell. 
Crabs are somewhat less expensive at times, but soft shells 
are always high-priced.

group in terms of the weight of the 100-Calorie portion.

Preserved fish and shellfish. — Smoking and salting are 
two old-time methods that are still in use, and smoked salmon, 
herring, and finnan haddie furnish us well-flavored foods at 
a reasonable price. Small smoked herring are eaten un- 
cooked, and the other two kinds are excellent broiled, or 
parboiled and finished in the oven. Salt cod should not be 
despised, for it is convenient and may be made palatable. 
Like the meats, the fish preserved by these methods are 
slightly less available for digestion. 

Preserving in oil is made familiar to us by the sardine of 
Italy in olive oil and the small herring of America in cotton- 
seed oil, which also bears the name of sardine. The latter 
is less delicate in flavor than the European sardine, but is of 
course cheaper, and is palatable and of equal food value. 

Canned fish and shellfish axe used in localities where fresh 
fish are not easily available, and should not be unwholesome 
if the process is properly inspected. Canned salmon is the 
most common, and makes an excellent luncheon dish when 
well prepared (see chapter on salads). 



242 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Principles of cooking. — The protein in all of these is the 
chief consideration. The oyster is more delicate when cooked 
just below the boiling point of water for a brief period only. 
This is also true of the clam, except the tough membranes 
which must be chopped. The flesh of both lobster and 
clam is toughened by cooking, and the process should be 
short. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. — All fish and shellfish should be thoroughly 
cleansed in cold water before using, and under running water when 
possible. Wash oysters, clams, and scallops in a colander or 
strainer under the faucet. If the oyster or clam liquor is used, 
put it through a fine strainer. 

i. To serve oysters and small clams raw. — Arrange on finely 
chopped ice on a plate, with a piece of lemon in the center. 
Cut a section of lemon, not a slice. Horse-radish is sometimes 
served with the raw oyster. Garnish with parsley if you wish. 

2. Creamed oysters. — Clean oysters of all pieces of shell. Cook 

them below the boiling point for a few minutes until plump 
and edges begin to curl. Drain and add to white sauce sea- 
soned with celery salt. Serve on toast, in bread cases, or patty 
shells. 

3. Sauted oysters. — Clean one pint of oysters, sprinkle on both 

sides with salt and pepper. Lift by the tough muscle with 
a fork and dip on both sides in cracker crumbs and saute' in 
butter until well browned on both sides.

Clean and pick over clams, separate the hard and soft part 
of clams and chop the former. Strain clam liquor through 
cheesecloth. Try out the pork and fry the onion in it until 
brown and turn into a large kettle. Boil potatoes until tender, 
drain, and pour potatoes into kettle. Add clams, milk, butter, 
and crackers broken into small pieces. Let cook three minutes. 
Just before serving add clam liquor previously heated. Serve 
in bowls. 
5. To prepare lobster and crabs for serving. — Make ready a large 
kettle of rapidly boiling water. Wrap a piece of paper around 
the lobster or crab, and plunge it head downward into the boil- 
ing water. Let the water boil gently for 20 minutes — longer 
if the lobsters are very large. 

To open, a strong pair of scissors is the best utensil and some- 
times a hammer is necessary for the heavy claws. Pull out 
the flesh, keeping it as whole as possible. The stomach of the 
lobster and crab should be taken out and can be recognized 
near the head. The long intestine should also be removed 
and is easy to find in the hinderpart by splitting open this part 
and removing a long white string. The soft green portion 
is the liver and is eatable. 

To serve. — (a) Pick apart and serve on lettuce with a 
French dressing, or (6) Serve hot with melted butter. 

Meat Substitutes 

Among these, beans, peas, lentils, eggs, milk, and cheese 
have already been mentioned. Fish is classed also as a meat 
substitute. 

Nuts. — These are a valuable meat substitute, some of 
them having a good protein content, and a high fat content 
as well. (See Fig. 66.) They may be served raw for dessert, 
with some fruit either fresh or dried, raisins and nuts being a 
pleasing combination. They should be thoroughly masti- 
cated. They are also palatable and possibly more digestible 
when cooked. The reason that many people consider nuts 
indigestible is because they eat them between meals, and do 
not give them a proper place in a meal, eating them when

enough food of other kinds has been taken. One who is 
open-minded in the matter of menus will find that nuts, raw 
or cooked, can literally take the place of meat in a meal. 

Almonds are always available in the markets and are so rich in 
protein and fat that a pound of shelled almonds is equivalent in 
food value to about three pounds of steak. At usual prices a good 
grade of almonds is more eeonomieal than the ordinary outs of meat. 

Chestnuts are a staple food in parts of Italy, and have a delicious 
flavor in soups, stuffings, and sauces. Our own native chestnuts, 
boiled and served whole or roasted, make an excellent simple dessert. 

Hickory nuts, English walnuts, pecan nuts, and filberts are not 
only palatable in muffins, eake, and yeast bread, but add to the 
food value in a rational way. 

Peanuts are rich in oil and protein. They are nearly equal to 
almonds in food value and are even more economical. Peanuts 
are too concentrated a food for eating between meals or to be taken 
after a meal already sufficient, but they may take the place of meat in 
the meal and peanut butter may be used on bread and in sandwiches 
without butter. They, too, may be used with cake and cookies. 

Chopped nuts may be served with a variety of desserts. Remem- 
ber always that they are to be considered food.

Teacheb's Note. — When time permits and circumstances make desir- 
able the development of the economic phase of the food work, students 
maybe directed to look up the composition, or the food value per ounce or per 
pound, of a variety of the foods of whatever group is under study and work 
out the return in food value for a given expenditure of money. The tables 
in Rose's "Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics" will be found especially 
useful in such work.

CHAPTER XV 

SALADS AND DESSERTS 

Salads and desserts are sometimes looked upon as luxuries, 
and something to be omitted where people must exercise 
strict economy, and as more or less indigestible forms of food 
to be avoided. As a matter of fact both of these types of 
dishes are extremely valuable in giving variety to the diet. 
They may be very inexpensive, and when they have the 
right relation to the rest of the meal, are not more indigestible 
than many other forms of food. A heavy salad or rich dessert 
eaten after a sufficient amount of other food will naturally 
cause digestive disturbance. 

To disprove the theory of great cost of desserts, two 
friends once had an amusing contest to see which could serve 
the largest number of palatable desserts at the lowest price. 
It was interesting to see how many could be made for a cost 
of from six to ten cents for a family of five. 

Materials used for salad. — The word " salad " is said to 
be derived from the Latin " salis " (salt) which implies that 
the salad has been looked upon more or less as a relish. We 
all associate with a salad appetizing crispness and freshness. 
The materials used in the modern salad -are so varied that a 
complete list would include nearly all our fruits and vege- 
tables and meat foods. 

Green vegetables. — Celery, chicory or endive, corn salad, cress, 
cucumber, dandelion, lettuce, onions, peppers, romaine or cos let- 
tuce, radishes, and tomatoes. 

247 



248 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cooked vegetables. — Beans, string and whole, beets, cauliflower, 
carrots, potatoes, and spinach. 

Fruits uncooked. — Any fresh fruit, possibly with the exception of 
some of the berries. 

Meat and poultry. — The white meats like veal, chicken, and 
turkey are more attractive in salad, but any kind of cold meat may 
be used. 

Fish and shellfish. — Lobsters, crabs, scallops, and cold fish. 

Nuts. — Several kinds may be used in combination with fruit. 

Jellies. — Tomato jelly, meat, chicken, and fish molded in 
jelly, may be served as a salad. 

Eggs. — Hard-boiled eggs are used as a garnish. 

Cream cheese. — May be-served with lettuce. 

Salad dressings. — Plain lettuce or celery served with salt 
is in a sense a salad, but it is our custom to dress the lettuce 
with a mixture which contains an acid and usually an oil. 
A very simple, old-fashioned form of dressing used in this 
country is vinegar and sugar. Substitute lemon juice or 
fresh lime juice for the vinegar and you will have a very 
refreshing and simple salad for a summer day. 

The ordinary dressing consists 1 of vinegar or lemon juice, 
and oil; another form is mayonnaise, where the yolk and 
sometimes the white of egg are used to hold the oil and vine- 
gar together. 

Another form is a cooked dressing which may be bottled 
and kept for a longer time than the French dressing or the 
mayonnaise. 

Olive oil. — This is the most delicious oil for salad dressing when the 
flavor is liked and when it can be afforded. 

Cottonseed and corn oil. — There are now in the market clarified 
cottonseed oil and corn oil that may be used in mayonnaise dress- 
ing, and the flavor is not unacceptable, and certainly superior 
to the poorer grades of olive oil which quite likely contain one of 
these oils as an adulterant. Cottonseed oil makes a better substi- 
tute for olive oil then does corn oil as it is at present refined. 



SALADS AND DESSERTS 



249 



Butler. — Butter may be used in boiled salad dressing for those 
who dislike the flavor of the oils. 

The acids in dressing. — These may be either vinegar or lemon juice, 
and many people with whom the vinegar disagrees can eat a salad 
made with lemon juice. The acid should not be used in excess 
in any case; the best dressings do not give a distinctively acid 
taste. 

Adjuncts. — Salt, mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. — The two important points in the prep- 
aration of the material for salad are, first, that everything should

be thoroughly dry, and, second, thoroughly chilled. The importance 
of these two points cannot be overemphasized, and they are of 
equal value in salad making. Many a salad is unpalatable because 
it is watery and wilted. For the preparation of green vegetables 
see Chapter VII. Vegetables should be cut in cubes or sometimes 
in slices. Meat, poultry, and shellfish should be cut in small pieces 
or chopped. The prepared meat should be mixed with some of 



250 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the oil and acid and allowed to stand in an ice box for some time 
before it is dressed and arranged for serving. This process is called 
marinating in the cookbooks, and gives a flavor to the salad that 
it cannot have if a dressing is poured over the meat just before 
serving. 

Combinations in salad. — Several well-known combinations 
will at once occur to you. Meat salads usually have a mixture 
of celery. Several vegetables may be used together, as beans and 
carrots, or carrots, peas, and string beans with lettuce. Apples, 
nuts, and celery make a pleasing combination. Indeed there would 
seem to be no end to the possibilities here. 

Serving and garnishing. — The principle here is to make the 
dish attractive with as little labor as possible. Everything served

as a garnish should be eatable. A bed of crisp dry lettuce leaves 
is the most attractive setting for any salad. When this is not 
procurable, cress makes an attractive border to a salad. Figure 
68 shows you a salmon jelly molded in a ring and attractively 
served in lettuce. Figure 67 shows a cucumber placed on lettuce 
leaves, dressed with a French dressing and sprinkled with chopped 
peppers. The cucumber is sliced ready to serve ; the slices being cut 
not entirely through the cucumber. This is rapidly prepared and

is most attractive. When the salad is arranged in its dish, it should 
be put in the ice box and allowed to remain until it is time to take 
it to the table. The salad is sometimes served on individual 
plates. 

i. French dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Salt | teaspoonful 

Pepper \ teaspoonful 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 4 tablespoonfuls 

Method. 

Mix the salt, pepper, and vinegar and stir in the olive oil 
slowly. A few drops of onion juice may be added. 

2. Mayonnaise dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Mustard 1 teaspoonful 

Salt 1 teaspoonful 

Powdered sugar 1 teaspoonful 
A few grains of cayenne 

Eggs Yolks of 2 

Lemon juice 2 tablespoonfuls 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 1J cups 

Method. 

Stir together the eggs, mustard, salt, pepper, and sugar. 
Add the oil, a drop at a time, stirring and beating constantly. 
The back of a silver fork is a good thing for mixing mayonnaise, 
though some people prefer a Dover beater. As the dressing be- 
comes very thick it should be thinned occasionally with vinegar 
and lemon, alternately, but never let it lose its consistency. 
After the first, the oil may be added more rapidly. All ingre- 
dients and utensils must be cold. If the weather is warm, the 
bowl should be surrounded with ice water. If the dressing should 
separate, begin with another yolk of egg and stir the separated 
mixture into it slowly, as before. Set the bowl in a cold 
place and it should keep for many days.

Add the vinegar and water and cook in a double boiler, stirring 
constantly until thick and smooth. Remove from the fire, stir 
in the butter and set away to cool. A little cream added after the 
dressing cools is a great addition. Sour cream may be used instead 
of the water, in which case less vinegar and butter should be used. 

4. Potato salad.

Select tart, juicy apples. Cut in quarters, pare and core 
and cut in 5-inch cubes. Add half as much celery, washed, 
scraped, and cut into cubes. Mix with boiled or mayonnaise 
dressing and serve cold on lettuce leaves. If handsome red 
apples can be had, they may be washed and polished and a 
slice cut from the stem end and the apple used as a cup after 
scooping out the inside to use for a filling with the celery. Serve 
on a lettuce leaf. Chopped nuts may be mixed with the apple 
and celery if desired. 

Stuffed tomato salad. 

Ingredients. 

Tomatoes, medium sized 

Boiling water 

Salt 

Cucumbers (or celery) 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce leaves 
Method. 

Cover medium sized tomatoes with boiling water for a min- 
ute and remove the skin. Cut a thin slice from the top and 
take out part of the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle inside of the 
tomato with salt, invert, and let stand one half hour. Fill 
tomatoes with cucumbers (or celery) cut in small cubes and 
moistened with mayonnaise dressing. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and garnish top with mayonnaise dressing. 



Laboratory management. — \ egg yolk (1 teaspoonful) and \ cup of olive 
oil is as small a quantity as is practicable to use in making the mayonnaise. 
This quantity made by groups of two works- out well as the process of adding 
the oil drop by drop is difficult for a begini, r working alone. The boiled 
dressing works in well as a variation of the boiled custard. 



254 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Desserts 

The dessert in this country includes the sweet dish, or the 
fruit at the end of the meal. In simple meals the dessert is 
usually one of the two, although in more elaborate meals 
fruit is served after the sweet dish, and sometimes crackers 
and cheese are served at the last. From the point of view 
of nutrition and digestibility this is more than is necessary, 
and you will notice that when both are served, the fruit is 
often declined. Like the salad, the, dessert may be made 
from a large variety of materials and bears different names. 
There are hot puddings and cold puddings, pies and tarts, 
jellies and ices and ice creams. It is very interesting to read 
over the many dishes of this class in a cookbook and to attempt 
to classify them. If you are fortunate enough to have access 
to a cookbook of the eighteenth century, you will find 
that much labor was given to the preparation of elaborate 
structures which served as table ornaments ; even now you 
will find French cooks who spend much time in making 
elaborate displays of their skill. For everyday life the 
dessert should be attractive to the eye and yet simple. 
Materials used in desserts. 

Eggs, milk, and cream; these are important and are used in cus- 
tards, in dishes stiffened with gelatin or thickened with cornstarch, 
or in ice cream. 

Breadstuff's. — Cake and sponge cake, bread crumbs and sliced 
bread, are valuable in desserts. Bread pudding may be made a 
very delicious dish. Bread may be combined with fruit in the shape 
of an escalloped dish. Baking powder biscuits, crust, and short- 
cake are also used. 

Other starchy substances. — These are cornstarch, arrowroot, 
sago, tapioca and manioca. 

Fruits. — Raw and cooked fruits of every possible kind. A few 
fruits like the lemon, orange, grapefruit, and melon are not cooked. 
For preparing fruit served alone, see Chapter VI. 



SALADS AND' DESSERTS 



255 



'Gelatin. — This material has been mentioned in the chapter on 
meat. It is prepared for use in desserts in a number of forms, the 
granular being the most convenient. Gelatin has the property, 
first, of absorbing water, then of dissolving at the boiling tempera- 
ture of water and becoming stiff again when cool. After dissolving, 
as it is cooling and just as it begins to thicken slightly, it can be 
beaten like white of egg. If beating is attempted while the liquid is 
warm, or again if it becomes too stiff, the result is not successful. 
This property makes it useful in the sponges and other fancy 
desserts where the light spongy texture is desirable. 

Making desserts attractive. — This is done by serving 
hot desserts in a dish around which a napkin may be folded ;

and cold desserts, especially those made with gelatin, may 
be molded in some attractive form and garnished. Figure 69 
shows a very simple gelatin dessert garnished with candied 
cherries and a little angelica, the stem of a plant which has 
been sugared, and the whole surrounded with whipped cream. 



256 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Whipping the cream and putting it around the' base takes 
only a few minutes. As in salad, the garnish should be eat- 
able and easily prepared. 

i. Boiled custard. 

Ingredients. 

Milk 1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Eggs 3 

Vanilla § teaspoonful 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Method. 

Put the milk, sugar, and salt in a double boiler to scald. Sepa- 
rate the eggs and set .the whites in a cold place until wanted. 
Beat the yolks until lemon-colored. Pour a little of the scalded 
milk on the yolks of the eggs, stirring until well mixed. Set the 
double boiler back on the stove and pour the egg and milk mixture 
slowly into the rest of the scalded milk, stirring constantly until 
thickened enough to coat the spoon. Remove from the fire, add 
the flavoring, and turn into a dish to cool. Just before serving 
beat the whites to a very stiff froth and pile by spoonfuls on the 
custard. The whites may be sweetened with powdered sugar 
after beating if desired. Corn starch may be used, and fewer eggs. 
2. Baked custard. 
Ingredients. 

Milk 1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt | teaspoonful 

Eggs 2 

Lemon or 

Vanilla J teaspoonful 

Method. 

Scald the milk, sugar, and salt together. Beat the eggs in a 
baking dish and pour the scalded milk over them. Add the 
flavoring and stir well. Set the baking dish in a pan of boil- 
ing water and bake in a moderate oven until a knife thrust into 
the custard will come out clean. Serve cold either plain, or with 
chocolate sauce. Nutmeg may be. grated on top of the custard 
before baking, or caramel flavoring may be added in place of 
the vanilla.

pick over and seed the dried fruit, slice the citron if it is used, 
and dredge all with flour. Stir together the milk and molasses, 
sift the dry ingredients with the flour, and stir the liquid into 
the flour slowly. Add the suet, beating the mass thoroughly, 
and last the fruit, sprinkling in both the suet and the fruit as 
you stir. Fill a greased mold f full, close tightly, and cook in 
a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Serve with a hard 
or foamy sauce. 



Laboratory management. — This can be made in class if each pupil will 
bring an empty baking powder or cocoa tin to school. A strip of greased 
cloth should be fastened around the edge of the cover. The recipe can be 
made in J cup proportions, and this amount can be cooked if the class 
period is two hours in length, but it is better to have the cooking finished 
at home. This is a seasonable exercise at Thanksgiving or Christmas.

Minute tapioca needs no soaking. If pearl tapioca is used, 
it must be soaked one hour in cold water to cover. Pick over 
and wash the tapioca, drain off the water and add tapioca to 
the milk and salt scalded in the double boiler, and cook until 
the tapioca is transparent, or about | hour. Beat eggs and 
add the sugar to them. Combine mixtures by pouring a little 
of the hot mixture in the egg and then stirring this into the 
mixture remaining in the double boiler. Stir over fire until 
it "becomes thick. Add the flavoring and pour into a dish to 
cool.

soon as it becomes sirupy stir occasionally until quite thick. 
Then beat with wire spoon or whisk until frothy. Fold in 
the beaten whites, and continue to beat lightly until quite 
stiff. Pile by spoonfuls on a plate and serve with boiled cus- 
tard, or mold as in Fig. 69. 

Frozen mixtures. — There are some interesting principles 
to note here. The freezing is accomplished by using a mix- 
ture of chopped ice and rock salt. Can you explain how this 
reduces the temperature? 

Another interesting point is this : Have you ever seen a 
milk bottle on a cold winter morning with the paper cover or 
even the metal cap pushed up, the frozen milk standing high 
above the top of the bottle? What does this suggest to you 
in connection with the filling of the ice cream freezer? 

It must be noted, too, that a larger amount of flavoring 
material is needed in a frozen dessert than in one that is not. 
The frozen custard, for instance, needs more vanilla than one 
prepared in the ordinary manner. Can you account for this ? 

Method of freezing. 

There are many patterns of ice cream freezers that are well 
constructed and inexpensive. They are sold by the size, a 2 quart 



262 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

freezer giving you 2 quarts of the frozen cream. See that the crank 
is oiled and the whole apparatus clean. Have ready pounded ice 
and rock salt, usually in the proportion of 1 part salt to 3 of ice. 
Machines come for cutting the ice, but it is easy to pound it in a 
strong bag. Set the freezer can in place, put around it the ice and 
salt alternately, shaking down and packing firmly. Have the ice 
cream mixture cool, pour it in, having the can not more than f full. 
Put on the lid, cover with ice and salt, and begin to turn the 
crank. Open and stir down once or twice, being careful to keep 
out the salt. Take out the crank before the cream is too stiff. Pack 
the cream firmly down in the can. See that the melted water is 
removed from the pail, put in more ice and salt, and leave until the 
ice cream is firm.

are given under strawberry mousse.

CHAPTER XVI 

PREPARATION OF MEALS AND TABLE SERVICE 

The preparation of a number of dishes assembled for a 
meal requires a skill quite different from that necessary for 
the making of a single dish. A menu being decided upon, 
it needs an accurate sense of time, forethought, and prompt- 
ness, to have a number of dishes ready at the same time, or 
in proper sequence if several courses are served. Such 
questions as the following must be answered : 

Technique of preparation. 

1. What steps in preparation can be taken ahead of time, as 
washing, paring, cutting, etc.? 

2. What dishes take the longest to cook ? 

3. Which must be served the moment they are done? 

4. Which can be kept hot for some time -without injury ? 

5. Which can be finished and cooled perhaps several hours 
before ? 

6. Do the dishes selected require the same utensils at the same 
time ? (If so, the menus must be changed.) 

7. What is the order of serving ? 

To understand the bearing of these questions you will need 
to select some menu and make a plan, for preparing it. (See 
exercises at the end of this chapter.) 

The fact is obvious that in preparing a meal you cannot 
finish the dishes one at a time, but that steps individual to 
each dish must be interwoven with each other, and the cook 
must have them all " on her mind," and is often doing half 
a dozen things at once. As a high school girl, preparing a 

265 



266 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

part of her first meal, remarked, " This is as good training as 
mathematics." 

The woman at home will devise many ways of easing and 
shortening the labor just before the meal is served, avoiding 
haste and anxiety in this way. With the fireless cooker and 
other slow-cooking apparatus, the heavy work may sometimes 
be done far ahead of mealtime. A dessert can be prepared 
and be cooking as breakfast dishes are washed, and at the 
time left overs are put away they can be arranged ready for 
serving, as in the case of poultry or meat to be served cold. 
While the preparation of the midday meal is in progress, 
something can sometimes be done for the last meal, too. 
This, indeed, is a field for generalship, and it is a successful 
campaign when the meals are all on time and well prepared, 
and the cook and family cheerful. 

Important points in serving each dish. — • Each dish should 
be perfectly done, neither over nor under cooked. All hot 
dishes should be hot, and cold dishes cold. Lukewarm food 
is not agreeable. Bread and cake and some kinds of pastry 
are the only foods that may have the temperature of the 
room. Sliced meat and salads should be cold. Chill choc- 
olate Eclairs before serving and see how much they are im- 
proved ; indeed, experiment with a number of foods that are 
usually served at room temperature. 

To keep food hot. — A hot closet above a* coal or gas range is 
made for this purpose, and steam heaters sometimes have hot 
closets. A double boiler is a help, and one utensil may be set into 
a larger, filled with boiling water. Some dishes can be set back on 
the stove, or over a simmering gas burner with an asbestos mat 
underneath. The oven may be used sometimes, with the door set 
ajar. The food may be kept covered unless it will steam, in 
which case cover it with a towel. Serve food in hot dishes. 

To keep food cool. — Leave the dish in the iee box until the last 
possible moment. Sometimes serve with ice (butter in warm 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 267 

weather). If ice is lacking, use other cooling devices. Serve in 
chilled dishes. 

Garnishing the dish. — All food must be neatly placed in the 
dish, and arranged or piled with some sort of symmetry, and this is 
the most that some people have time to do. Many foods may be 
served in the utensil or dish in which they are cooked, and in the 
case of a baking dish, if its appearance is not neat, a napkin can 
be folded about it. The simplest form of garnish is browning on 
the top, which makes many dishes attractive (mashed potato). 

Make the garnishing simple, and have it eatable when possible. 
Slices of hard boiled eggs on spinach, chopped parsley and butter 
on boiled or mashed potato, parsley and slices of lemon, with meat 
and fish. 

Vegetable borders are attractive and save labor in dish washing. 
Arrange the meat in the center of the platter, and pile mashed po- 
tato, or boiled rice or peas or beans, or a mixture of hot vegetables 
around the edge. This saves time in table service, too. 

The garnishing of salads, desserts, and cakes is treated in pre- 
vious chapters. 

Table equipment and service. — ■ This is a place where 
beauty is a large element, and most people understand the 
charm of a daintily laid table, as the family gathers for a 
meal. But many factors must be taken into account, for 
it is an easy matter to pass from the simple and beautiful 
to an extravagant display, to spend more on the dining-room 
equipment than the income warrants, and to waste much 
energy in unnecessary work. Our great need here is to learn 
to see beauty in simplicity. We must remember, too, that 
many people in our country live in crowded quarters, and have 
no time for anything but the simplest kind of table service. 1 

The table should be firm, large enough to accommodate the family 
comfortably, and it should permit of extension when occasion de- 
mands a larger board. The top should have an oil finish that will 
not easily mar and that can be washed off. Have a thick cloth or 
pad to protect it — the "silence cloth." 



1 For Furnishing the Dining Room, see "Shelter and Clothing," p. I 



268 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Table covers may be the small doilies with centerpiece, strips 
of fine linen crash, or blue or brown and white Japanese toweling 
laid across both ways, a cloth that just covers the table, or a large 
cloth that hangs well below the table edge. The doilies and strips 
are used conventionally for breakfast and dinner, but save much 
labor when used for all meals. The color may be white, or tinted, 
but the dark-colored cloth should be banished. 

The material may be linen or mercerized cotton. Many people 
think white table oilcloth is impossible, but a table covered with 
it may be made very pretty ; it can be kept clean by washing at 
the end of each meal, and the saving in labor is incalculable. 

The pattern and quality and cost of table linens are mentioned 
in Chapter XXI. 

Napkins may match the tablecloths. A small size economizes 
labor. Avoid fringes, selecting a scalloped edge or hemstitch. 
Japanese paper napkins are useful in summer, and for box luncheons. 

The dishes. — Only a few practical suggestions can be given here. 
This is a topic for the art class. 

Buy from "open stock." This means, not a single set, but a 
pattern that the manufacturer and retailer have always on hand, so 
that the purchaser can buy one plate or cup and saucer, to replace 
breakage. 

An elaborate or highly colored design becomes wearisome, is 
not practical for those who have a limited supply of dishes, and is 
in questionable taste. A positive color demands always the same 
general scheme for other decorations. A band of color, or a narrow 
design at the edge, of a color harmonizing easily with other colors, 
is in good taste. Gold and green are safe colors. See Fig. 72. 
White dishes with a raised border are dainty, and any color scheme 
may be used with them. See Pig. 71. 

The number of dishes depends upon the simplicity or elaborate- 
ness of the method of living and the size of the family. It is much 
better to begin with a few, and increase the number when neces- 
sary, than to have the shelves filled with unused ware. (See 
exercises.) 

Glassware is pressed or cut, the latter being beautiful, but an 
expensive luxury. Glasses for water, and dishes for berries, are made 
with simple and attractive designs in the pressed ware, and serve 
all ordinary purposes. A pretty shape for the glass for water is 
shown in Fig. 71.

Silver and plated silver for knives, forks, and spoons, coffee and 
tea sets, all add to the charm of the table." A large collection is 
not necessary for everyday use, and it adds greatly to the labor of 
the housewife. Figure 70 shows some good designs in spoons, 
and spoons and forks of different sizes come in the same design. A 
simple design is easy to clean. Three sizes of spoons, tablespoons, 
teaspoons, and coffee spoons, and two sizes of forks are all suffi- 
cient, with a few larger spoons for service and desserts. 

Triple-plated ware lasts for years, if well cared for, and comes 
in good designs. 

Pewter, familiar in olden days, is being used again in Colonial 
designs, and makes an attractive tea or coffee set, is less costly 
than solid silver, and has a better tone and color than plated ware. 

Cutlery. — Plated knives are easy to care for, but steel knives 
are more effective for some purposes. Purchase good quality steel 
knives, especially in the carving set. 

Setting the table. — The first principles here are to have 
everything clean and shining, and to lay everything straight. 
Have as little on the table as possible. It is not comfortable 
to have a large array of articles at one's place. Figure 71 
shows you a dainty and well-laid table, arranged for a Sunday 
night supper, and this arrangement is a good one for any 
meal, with substitutes for the chafing dish. 

Be sure that the cloth is straight, the center fold in the middle of 
the table, and that the cloth hangs evenly on all sides. See that 
centerpiece and doilies are laid at even distance. 

Laying each place. — In Fig. 71 the knife, edge out, is at the right, 
with one spoon, and the glass is at the right, in line with the end of 
the knife. Two forks are at the left, and a plate for bread and but- 
ter, with bread knife are at the left, opposite the glass. The napkin 
is at the left. This plan, somewhat elaborated, may be safely fol- 
lowed for formal service. Two knives may be placed at the right, 
with the soup spoon, and three forks at the left. If more than 
these are needed, they may be supplied later, laid on the plate placed 
for a certain course, in the middle of the plate, handle toward the 
guest. 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



271 




272 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The other articles on the table may vary widely. For every- 
day use, where there is no maid, or only one, set in places convenient 
to pass, the salt and pepper, vinegar and sugar, bread plate and 
butter plate, and any small dish of condiment or pickle, with pretty 
mats for the hot dishes to be set on later, and enough spoons for ' 
serving. See that the arrangement is symmetrical and convenient. 
A table laid in this way has room for little more in the way of 
" decoration " than a slender vase holding a few flowers in the center. 
The dishes for dessert can be ready on a side table. 

For formal service nothing is placed on the table in addition 
to the equipment at each place, but some centerpiece containing 
ferns or flowers, with pretty dishes of silver or glass holding relishes, 
candies, or dried fruits, a graceful arrangement being to alternate 
four of these with four candlesticks for meals served late in the 
day. 

Table decorations. — Here fancy may run riot with color schemes, 
and pretty devices for special occasions. A painted place card, a 
small bonbon box, a single flower with a pin for fastening it on, — ■ 
all these have their place at times. Satin ribbon is not an appropriate 
table decoration laid across the table in a broad band, even when it 
displays a class color. Find some other way to make the color 
effective. A color scheme in the food can be carried out to a degree 
for some occasion, but do not let the color interfere with a really 
satisfactory menu. 

Relishes have already been suggested as decoration — radishes 
cut in rose shape, olives, candies, and fruit. 

The tray for invalid and convalescent. — Figures 72 and 73 suggest 
the daintiness possible in setting a tray. It is well worth while to 
spend time in the careful arrangement of the tray, for pretty dishes 
in orderly array may tempt the appetite of the invalid. 

Waiting on the table. — When we wait on ourselves, this 
should be done with cheerfulness, arid all should take a share. 
After the food is on the table, one person can " help " one 
thing and one another. It is a good plan for the young people 
of the family to take turns as waiter in removing the soiled 
dishes and food and putting on the dessert. A quick method 
is to place a tray on a small stand near the table, taking the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



273 




2 



274 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

dishes from one place at a time, and sorting them on the tray 
as you go. The tray can then be carried into the kitchen, 
with the dishes partly arranged for washing. 

One mother uses a plan for having everybody help at 
breakfast time, modeled after the tray system of a cafeteria. 
The breakfast is cooked ready to serve, and on the kitchen 
table is a small tray for each one of the family of four. All 
necessary articles are at hand, and even the boy of seven sets 
his own tray and helps himself to food, and takes his place 
at the table ; and then when the meal is ended each one 
carries out his dishes and puts them in neat array for washing. 

The waitress at a formal meal has to be alert, rapid yet 
gentle in all her motions, with a desire to make other 
people comfortable, and a faculty for remembering their 
likes and dislikes. A good waitress does not pass a second 
time a dish once declined. 

The waitress must know the menu, and have everything 
ready for each course at hand on the sideboard, with dishes 
kept hot in the hot closet. 

The table is laid in time, she herself is immaculate, and the 
room is well aired and the temperature agreeable. A piece 
of bread is folded in each napkin. If the first course is cold, 
— perhaps a grapefruit, — she arranges these at each place. 
If it is to be a hot bouillon, the cook tells her that all is ready, 
and then she informs the hostess that dinner or luncheon is 
served. 

The details of this type of waiting vary with the place and 
the taste of the hostess, but the following method is simple 
and rapid. 

Serving. — Serve everything from the side table. Hold the 
dish to be served firmly in two hands with a napkin underneath, 
a tablespoon and fork being placed on the dish. Pass to the left 
of the guest, and hold the dish at a convenient height and near the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



275 




a 



276 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

plate. After all the dishes in a course are passed in this way, watch 
to see if second helps are needed. 

Remove the soiled plates at the left, and place the clean at the 
left, removing with the left hand and placing with the right. 

Fill glasses at the right, and remove silver at the right before 
dessert when, there are pieces left unused. 

Brush crumbs with a soft, folded napkin upon a plate, at the 
left, just before dessert when everything is taken from the table 
but the center decoration, the candies, and the glass of water. 
" With this plan the guest helps himself each time, even the after 
dinner coffee being passed on a tray with cream and sugar, and he 
can take as little as he pleases, or decline. Some hostesses have some 
of the courses arranged on individual plates and placed, and these 
may be placed either from the left or right. But the other method 
is simple and satisfactory. 

The finger bowls may be set on plates of dessert size with a 
doily underneath. If a spoon or fork is needed with the dessert, 
one or both may be placed on the plate also, one on_each side, if both 
are used. The bowls should be less than half full of water and the 
water should be a comfortable temperature, neither cold nor notice- 
ably warm. Set the plates arranged in this way before each guest. 
The guest himself will remove the bowl and doily and silver before 
the dessert is passed. In large banquets the food must be placed 
on the individual plate. 

The question is sometimes asked, " Who shall be served first? " 
It is a good plan to change this from course to course, begin- 
ning the first time with the guest of honor. It is not a matter of 
great importance, provided no one has to wait long. Two waitresses 
make the service quicker. 
. The guests of honor sit at the right of the host and hostess. 

The number of courses. — Two or three courses are enough for 
everyday comfort and health. In formal serving, it is good taste 
not to have too many. A first course of grapefruit or perhaps 
oyster cocktail, a soup, a fish course, or some light substitute for it, 
— the main course with meat, a salad, dessert, coffee — make a quite 
sufficient meal. The " entree " is a light dish, say sweetbreads in 
cases, after the meat course, but it is quite unnecessary. Many 
people are becoming very weary of the long-drawn-out dinners and 
banquets, which are certainly far from hygienic. 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 277 

Carving. — This is an art that used to be taught as an 
accomplishment to girls, and it is not an easy matter to master. 

If not done at the table, it must nevertheless be well done. 
Watch a good carver, and practice when you have a chance. A few 
simple directions can be given, but a demonstration is really neces- 
sary. First and foremost, have a sharp, strong knife, and a strong 
fork. The next essential is a platter large enough to hold the meat, 
without having it slip off. The fork must be firmly placed in the 
meat, and the meat held down. Notice the shape of the cut of 
meat. Meat must be cut across the grain. Loosen from the bone, 
notice the grain, and cut evenly and firmly. With fowl, discover 
the joints, pierce with the end of the knife, disjoint, and lay at the 
side, and then slice the breast across the grain. If carving at the 
table, learn the preference of those served, whether they wish light 
or dark meat, meat well done or underdone. Have a spoon for 
dish gravy and stuffing.

CHAPTER XVII 
THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 

This is at all times an important matter, but the notable 
increase in food prices, during the last decade, has made it a 
matter of interest to all. The cost of food is one item only 
in the whole cost of living, and this is affected by many con- 
ditions in manufacture and commerce and the business of 
the nations. Economists and others interested in social 
questions are studying the problem, but as yet they do not 
agree upon the cause, or causes, of the increased cost of living. 
We cannot hope, therefore, to understand the situation fully ; 
but we must be determined to spend money as wisely as we 
can, and to learn what we may about food prices in relation to 
food values. There are a few causes of the difference in price 
between one food and another that are more or less unchang- 
ing. The cost of food may be considered from several points 
of view. The question of the cost for each individual a day 
and relation of cost and nutritive value are studied in Chapter 
XVIII. The proportion of the income to be spent for food 
is taken up in Chapter XIX. 

Labor and prices. — The amount of labor involved in 
producing a food material affects its price. Meats cost 
more than staple vegetable foods, like corn, wheat, or beans, 
because we must raise the corn first to feed the animals. 
Meat is as cheap as vegetable foods only when the animal 
can find its own food, as in the pioneer days of any country, 
when only a small part of the land is under cultivation. To 
the Pilgrim Fathers, meat was cheaper than corn, in terms of 

'278 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 279 

labor, with deer at hand in the forest and corn raised with 
difficulty in small clearings. Meat production is now an 
industry, and the product an expensive one, especially as the 
wide cattle ranges of our West, where the animals have for- 
merly found natural food, are now used more and more for 
other purposes. 

Transportation. — Carrying food from place to place in- 
creases its cost. In one sense this is another form of labor. 
Each person who handles the food material from producer 
to consumer adds something to what the consumer pays. 
We have heard much discussion of late of the " middleman," 
and the effort to bring the producer and consumer closer 
together. This simply means doing away with some person 
who handles the product after it leaves the producer and 
before it reaches the consumer and who must have something 
for his labor. In transportation there is another element in- 
volved, the original cost of the means of conveyance ; and the 
natural wear and tear on the product are items that increase 
the final cost. The modern farmer who carries his produce 
to market in an auto truck must have a return for the original 
cost of the truck and the keeping of it in repair. The long- 
distance railway furnishes cold-storage cars, and the cost of 
these and their maintenance affect freight rates. A peach 
from South Africa costs from fifty to sixty cents in the Boston 
market. It is probably true, in this case, that a fancy price 
is asked because African fruit is a novelty here ; but the diffi- 
culty and expense of long-distance transportation naturally 
make it costly. 

Demand and supply. — The relation of demand to supply 
affects the price of food in a way not difficult to understand. 
Where the supply is permanently small and the demand 
widespread, the price of the particular food material will be 
high, and vice versa. Olive oil is a good example of the per- 



280 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

manently high-priced food. California olive oil brings a high 
price not only because it is pure and well flavored, but be- 
cause jnany people want it, and the industry is a small one. 
Many years are needed to establish an olive grove, and olive 
raising is not a popular way of making money, because it is 
slow. One enterprising American firm has bought an olive 
grove in Spain, and is using new methods there, but the prod- 
uct, though delicious, is no cheaper. Although the manu- 
facture of olive oil will doubtless remain a rather small in- 
dustry, the use of olive oil is increasing, in this country, at 
least. It does not seem likely, therefore, to become a cheap 
form of fat. 

We find nearly the opposite of this in cottonseed oil, a 
large supply and a relatively smaller demand making a low 
price. The seed (a by-product of the cotton industry) con- 
tains a large quantity of oil, and it is not all used as food. 
Therefore, it is permanently a low-priced fat, as contrasted 
with the permanently high-priced fat, olive oil. 

Agricultural conditions. — There are two things of which 
the farmer can never feel sure, the kind of weather to expect 
and the general character of the season. Of course, the 
season affects the quality and the amount of any crop, and 
this, again, influences' the price. 

Another aspect of the effect of season on food is this : that 
a food is in its own locality cheaper when it is in season than at 
other times of year, when it has to be brought from a distance. 

Insect pests and plant diseases not infrequently spoil a 
crop, and the market price goes up with the smaller supply. 
This is what happened not long since to the potato crop and 
potato prices, when potatoes were affected by the potato 
blight. Moreover, if the farmer succeeds in keeping his 
crop free from a particular pest, it means a more or less per- 
manent increase in his expenses, for in fighting insects and 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 281 

r 

fungi there is an outlay for machinery and chemicals, and 
much labor is expended. Unfortunately, injurious insects 
and plant diseases are on the increase, and this may mean a 
permanent rise in the cost of certain foods. Another fact 
has to be reckoned with in comparing the prices of different 
foods. Some vegetables are more difficult to raise than 
others, even when the season is favorable, and the insects 
at least partly conquered. Some plants have more vitality 
than others, and grow under almost any condition of soil and 
moisture. 

Animal diseases must also affect the price of food. If a 
large number of cattle are found to have tuberculosis, and 
are condemned as food, healthy cattle bring a higher price, 
because, again, the supply is small in relation to the demand. 

Quality of food. — Poor food always costs less money than 
good food, but it may not be economy to buy it. There 
may be more usable material in one good apple at five cents 
than in three wormy ones for five. 

Form and place in which food is sold. — Food in the 
package costs more than in bulk, and each fancy label adds a 
fraction to the cost. Plate-glass windows and ribbon decora- 
tions in a shop and the large expense of rent on a fashionable 
street are all paid for by the consumer. 

Relative cost of home and shop products. — When pre- 
pared food of any kind is purchased, one pays for raw mate- 
rial plus the cost of fuel and the labor involved in the cooking 
and the cleaning of apparatus and kitchen. For example, 
canned soup sold by one of the best manufacturers brings 
a good price because so much time and labor are used in a 
careful inspection of all material, and in keeping up a high 
standard of cleanliness. Remember, too, that whenever 
cooked food appears on the table, these two items, fuel and 
labor, are in reality added to the cost of the raw material. 



282 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We may not pay cash always for the labor, but it must be 
accounted for in time and energy. The woman who says, 
" My time doesn't count," has a poor opinion of herself. 
Whether or not it is better to buy cooked food or to prepare 
food at home is discussed on page 292. 

Other elements in food prices. — So far we have considered 
those causes of food prices that are what may be called 
" natural," always to be taken into account, and only partly 
under our control. There are others that have to do with 
big business methods and interests and that have great in- 
fluence at some one period in a nation's life, and less at others. 
They are more or less under our control if we have the wis- 
dom and courage to act. A discussion of these causes is 
part of the study of economics proper, and we can only stop 
by the way to think of them for a moment. 

Transportation must always increase cost, as we have 
learned, but bad methods, involving the handling of food by 
many people, increase it unnecessarily. Our present methods 
of marketing food are clumsy, and not economical, especially 
in large cities. The subject is being seriously studied with a 
view to improvement, possibly by the establishment of public 
markets. 

At present we have a bewildering state of things, but the 
housekeeper who sincerely desires, can learn to buy and pre- 
pare the less costly foods in an appetizing way, and leave 
nothing for the garbage pail but the parts that are actually 
not eatable. 

Comparative costs. — It would be useless to print here a 
list of actual prices, since they vary in different localities, 
and are constantly changing. This list can be made by 
yourselves in your notebooks for your own home town, and 
for the current year. The table on page 317 is a guide, how- 
ever, for in spite of fluctuations in prices there are certain 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 



283 



foods that are permanently more economical than others; 
for example, grain products than meats, for reasons already- 
explained. As a rule, the rising cost of food has been so 
general as not to change greatly the relative economy of the 
different types of food as compared with each other. 

Cost and nutritive value. — The discussion of cost has 
dealt so far with the cost of food materials as they are found 
in the market. What we are really seeking to learn is the 
amount of nutritive material to be obtained for a given sum 
of money, and in order to do this, we must think of our pur- 
chases in terms of the foodstuffs and their values. The 
accompanying table from a government bulletin 1 gives an 
estimate of cost from this point of view in terms of protein 
and fuel value. Notice that wheat bread is a cheap food, 
standing first in the amount of building material and energy.

The price quoted for eggs is low, and even less could be ob- 
tained for ten cents at prevailing prices in 1913-1914. This 
kind of estimate is a help in making menus and dietaries. 
(See Chapter XVIII.) Another method of estimating econ- 
omy for this purpose is by calculating the cost of 100-Calorie 
portions of various food materials. A table giving such a 
comparison will be found in the next chapter. 

Purchasing Food 

In addition to the general principles of buying discussed 
in Chapter XXI there are some details to be studied in 
purchasing food. 

Personal attention in buying food. — It is absolutely 
necessary to visit the market and the grocery where food is 
purchased. The purchaser would not fail to visit a shop 
before deciding to patronize it regularly, but frequent calls 
are necessary if buying is to be economical. Select the 
grocery, market, and bakery with a view to their cleanliness. 
Notice if the doors and windows are screened, and if proper 
effort is made to catch flies that may have entered. Refuse 
to buy food that is exposed upon the sidewalk, and if it is 
within doors, see that it is protected from dust and flies. 
The best markets now have tiled walls and floors, which help 
to insure cleanliness. The difference in odor is marked be- 
tween a market that is properly cleaned daily, and one where 
the proprietor uses uncleanly methods. Meat and vege- 
tables, in particular, should be personally selected whenever 
this is possible. The butcher must understand that the pur- 
chaser is familiar with the different cuts of meat and that 
honest service is demanded in regard to the quality, trimming, 
and weight of the meat. One does not want to be too sus- 
picious, but it is well for the butcher to know that the pur- 
chaser has a set of standard scales at home by which to prove 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 285 

the accuracy of his weighing. It is also important to inspect 
fruit and vegetables for quality and cost. 

Quantities in which to purchase food. — The amount that 
one purchases of a certain food depends on its keeping quali- 
ties, and upon the storage space available at home. A gen- 
eral rule may be stated : Buy perishable foods in small 
quantities; non-perishable foods in large. The reason for 
buying in larger quantity is that the cost is somewhat less, 
although sometimes it seems but little less. Some one has 
remarked that no one is a good buyer who does not consider 
a quarter of a cent. In a modern house or apartment where 
there is not room for a barrel of flour or sugar, then the 
quantity must be gauged by the space. The same is true of 
canned goods as of flour and sugar. Buying by the dozen 
saves a little on each can if you have shelf room for piling the 
cans. 

Foods may be classed in this connection as perishable, 
semi-perishable, and non-perishable. This depends some- 
what for any one housekeeper upon the size of her refrigera- 
tor, and upon an available place where food may be cool, 
even if not so cold as in the refrigerator. Those foods 
classed here as perishable are those which readily " spoil," 
that is, those that are affected by mold and bacteria on ac- 
count of the moisture that they contain, and also those that 
lose flavor and freshness quickly. Those most easily affected 
should be kept the coldest ; those in the semi-perishable 
group do not deteriorate so rapidly, although a low tem- 
perature is desirable with all of these. Under the non-perish- 
able foods are classed those that are not subject to bacteria 
or mold in ordinary circumstances. These should be kept 
dry, however, and never in a heated place. In a sense, no 
food material is non-perishable. Insects sometimes develop 
in the cereal products, for instance, and the material is thus 



286 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

rendered unfit for food. The food adjuncts do not spoil 
except as they lose flavor if kept too long. 

Perishable. — Milk, cream, uncooked meat, uncooked fish, shell- 
fish, berries, fruits with delicate skins, lettuce, and vegetables that 
wilt easily. 

Semi-perishable. — Butter, eggs, cooked meat and fish, root 
vegetables, cooked vegetables, left overs in general, skin fruits like 
apples, bananas, oranges, and lemons, dried fruits, scalded milk 
and cream, smoked and salted fish and meats, open molasses and 
sirup. 

Non-perishable. — Flour, meals and cereals, sugar, salt, and other 
condiments and flavorings, jellies, preserves and canned goods, 
coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate. 

Suggestions for buying. — Milk and cream must be de- 
livered daily. The average amount used by the family is 
the regular order. Fresh meat should be delivered on the 
day wanted unless the refrigerator is large with a space for 
hanging meat. Even then, it should not be kept more than 
twenty-four hours. Meat should not be placed directly on 
the ice. Fresh berries and delicate vegetables should be 
delivered on the day wanted. Butter and eggs may be - pur- 
chased once a week ; other semi-perishables in quantities 
depending on storage space. It is economical to buy a box 
of lemons, and the root vegetables in large quantities. Flour 
and sugar are purchased by the bag or barrel ; lump sugar, 
in boxes. Breakfast cereals are best bought in packages, 
and it is wise not to buy a large number at one time. 
It is better to purchase oftener and have fresher material. 
Coffee may be bought in pound cans, but it is economy to 
purchase it in five or ten pound quantities, unground. Tea 
comes in closely sealed packages, in \, J, and 1 lb. and 
larger. Cocoa is bought in \ lb. cans, but it is economy 
to buy in large cans if it is frequently used. Macaroni is 
bought by the package, and the number at one time must 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 287 

depend on how much it is used in the menu. Rice, tapioca, 
and sago may be bought in bulk and kept in tin or glass jars. 
Salt by the bag or box. Spices, ground, in tight boxes; 
whole in bulk, to be kept in tightly closed cans. Molasses 
comes by the gallon or in cans. If in bulk, it is usually acid ; 
in the can it is not. Vinegar comes by the gallon, or in 
bottles. Canned and preserved goods, singly, by the dozen, 
or case. Bakery products, when bought at all, should be 
purchased daily, or every other day. Do not buy so much 
that stale bread accumulates. 

Weights, measures, and packages. — The buyer is at a 
disadvantage here in regard to quantities, for the baskets in 
which fruits and vegetables are sold do not always conform 
to the standard dry measures, and dishonest dealers evade 
the law in regard to the use of standard scales. Even if 
they have the standard, they resort to tricks that give the 
customer short weights. Here the Bureau of Weights and 
Measures, with its Commissioner and corps of inspectors, 
comes to the aid of the purchaser. Effective work has been 
done in our cities in enforcing the laws, and this work con- 
tinues. 

Selling fruit, vegetables, and even eggs by weight would 
simplify matters in many ways, and this is the custom in 
some parts of the United States with vegetables and fruit, 
although it is not yet a common practice ; with eggs it seems 
more convenient to sell by the dozen, but grading according 
to size is a step toward standardization. 

The alluring packages in which so many articles are offered 
are quite uneven as to the quantities they contain. They 
certainly do awaywith some handling of food, and they keep 
out dust. Unfortunately, an attractive package does not 
guarantee a clean factory or clean handling in the packing. 
Dried figs, for example, in pretty baskets are sometimes 



288 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

packed in uncleanly places. Moreover, small packages are 
poor economy, since the box adds to the cost of the food 
material, and sometimes there seems even more package than 
food. If the family consumes many biscuits or " crackers," 
it costs considerably more to buy them in packages. Yet, 
these are convenient, and should be cleanly, and are justi- 
fied for these reasons, provided the housekeeper does not buy 
many small packages. 

The quantities in canned goods are variable and sometimes 
below measure when purchased from a second-rate dealer. 
In September, 1914, the net weight amendment to the 
National Food Law will go into effect, after which, in general, 
foods sold in packages must be labeled to show net weight 
or measure or numerical count. 

As already suggested, you should own standard scales for 
testing the purchases made by weight, even baker's bread. 
Buy fruit and vegetables by the quart, peck, and bushel, 
rather than by the basket of uncertain measure. Examine 
baskets containing small fruits to see if they have false 
bottoms. If you discover small measure, report at once to 
the dealer, and to whatever authority has charge of such 
matters in your town. 

Quality. — Modern methods of manufacture, transporta- 
tion, and storage make it difficult to determine the history 
and quality of food we purchase in the markets. Yet the 
consumer has a natural right to know if the food offered for 
sale is the best of its kind ; fresh eggs, clean milk, meat from 
healthy animals, untainted and free from harmful preserva- 
tives, sound vegetables and fruit, manufactured and pre- 
served foodstuffs unspoiled by the manufacturing processes, 
free from harmful preservatives, and of good flavor. Many 
people must be in danger of forgetting the flavor of a fresh- 
laid egg. The familiar signs in many small shops, " Fresh 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 289 

eggs," " Strictly fresh eggs," " Fancy eggs," are amusing, 
but they bespeak an unnatural state of things. 

As our business methods have created conditions beyond 
the control of the individual consumer it follows that we must 
take concerted action, and make and enforce whatever laws 
are' necessary. This is done partly through the Federal 
government, and partly through state laws and municipal 
ordinances. Thus, while we may not know the actual con- 
ditions in which food is produced, we may through legislation 
seek to insure that the food we buy shall be 

(1) what it purports to be in kind and amount, 

(2) free from deterioration or unwholesome conditions, 

(3) possessed of full nutritive value. 

The Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, com- 
monly known as " The Pure Food Law," and on which sub- 
sequent legislation by most of the states has been largely 
based, defines the main types of adulteration and misbrand- 
ing, but, except in the case of confectionery and of habit- 
forming drugs, does not name the specific substances which 
are to be prohibited or restricted in use, nor does the law 
itself contain standards of composition for foods. 

According to this law a food is deemed adulterated : 

(1) If any substance has been mixed or packed with it so 
as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or 
strength. 

(2) If any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part. 

(3) If any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part 
abstracted. 

(4) If it be mixed, colored, coated, powdered, or stained 
in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed. 

(5) If it contain any added poisonous or other added 
deleterious ingredient which may render such article in- 
jurious to health. 

tr 



290 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) If it consists in whole or in part of a filthy, decom- 
posed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any por- 
tion of an animal Unfit for food, or if it be the product of a 
diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by 
slaughter. 

And a food is deemed to be misbranded : 

(1) If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the 
distinctive name of another article. 

(2) If it be labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead 
the purchaser, or purport to be a foreign product when not 
so, or if the contents shall have been substituted in whole or 
in part, or if it fail to bear a statement on the label of the 
quantity or proportion of any narcotic or habit-forming 
drug which it contains. 

(3) If it bear an incorrect statement of weight or 
measure. 

(4) If the package containing it or its label shall bear any 
statement, design, or device which is false or misleading in 
any particular. 

For a fuller discussion of the basis of pure food legislation 
and the essential features of the United States laws see Sher- 
man's "Food Products," from which a part of the summary 
here given is drawn. 

The modern cold storage plant is of immense service in 
keeping food from the season of abundance to that of scar- 
city, but it may prove worse than useless if improperly 
managed. State and federal laws must control the manage- 
ment, and government inspection must be thorough. Cold 
storage would be a benefit to all under proper conditions of 
management, and the prices of many foods would be evenly 
adjusted by the maintenance of a steady supply. Many 
states now have laws regulating cold storage plants and 
there is every reason to hope that the abuses which have 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 291 

sometimes existed will be eliminated and the usefulness of 
cold storage extended. 

We may feel that the progress of the pure food movement 
has been most satisfactory, even though much more remains 
to be done. The states generally have either enacted new 
food laws, or revised their laws following the national law. 
Under the national law over 2000 prosecutions have already 
(1913) been decided in favor of the government. 

Congress has passed an even more stringent law for meat 
inspection supplementary to the Pure Food Law with ample 
appropriation for its enforcement. Moreover, in 1913, the 
Secretary of Agriculture appointed outside experts to in- 
spect meat-packing establishments throughout the country. 
This inspection is to check up the regular work being done 
by the Bureau of Animal Industry. 

The enforcing of federal and state laws has already largely 
stopped the misbranding of package foods as to weight or 
measure, cheap substitutions, the removal of valuable in- 
gredients, and the sale of decomposed or tainted food derived 
from diseased animals. Remember that abuses can be kept 
down to any extent that we are willing to pay for. Tax- 
payers must appropriate money to pay for inspection, for 
laws, no matter how good, will not insure pure food unless 
carried out faithfully by an adequate number of specially 
trained inspectors. 

In the face of all these difficulties we must not be frightened 
into that state of mind where danger seems to lurk in every 
mouthful. We must use caution and common sense in our 
buying, and earnestly, support every good movement for 
bettering conditions. 

There is a certain difference in quality even at a first class 
dealer's that one must learn to distinguish. One can of 
peaches will cost more than another, because the peaches are 



292 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

larger. If it is only this, and there is only a slight difference 
in flavor in favor of the more costly, buy the cheaper by all 
means. A fancy brand of imported preserves brings a fancy 
price which it is not worth while to pay. We have to learn 
to distinguish between poor and good quality, on the one 
hand, and between good and what may be called " fancy," 
on the other. We should demand the good, but most of us 
cannot afford the " fancy." 

Ready-cooked foods. — More and more cooked food, 
canned or otherwise, is taking its place in the market. When 
canned goods were first manufactured on a large scale they 
comprised fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish, but we are now 
accustomed to a miscellaneous variety, including soups, 
baked beans, puddings, and pudding sauces, spaghetti, 
hashed meat, and shellfish. Bakery products have a larger 
sale than ever, and are found in small towns, and even in 
country districts carried there by bakers' wagons. In our 
large cities we find the " delicatessen shop " very common, 
where small portions of cooked meats and fowl may be pur- 
chased after the custom of Europe, and these stores are open 
even on Sunday. 

How shall we decide what is best for us in our buying? 
We must not condemn entirely the buying of cooked food 
without a careful study of the situation. The custom has 
grown with changes in our mode of living, especially in cities, 
where the small apartment is common, and where gas is the 
fuel. Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare foods 
that need long and slow cooking, and these processes are 
more expensive when gas is used. The long slow cooking of 
soup and beans, the even baking of bread, are difficult to 
accomplish. The odors from these processes fill the small 
apartment, and scent it for some time, and this is unpleasant 
at all seasons. 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 293 

Take another example, the canning and preserving of 
fruits. The first cost of the fruit is usually high in the city, 
and this plus the sugar and the gas, and the labor and the 
lack of storage space make it seem impracticable in these 
conditions, and many people decide in favor of buying goods 
already canned. Such housekeeping is simplified by buying 
cooked products to some extent. The fireless cooker helps 
here, but not for all processes. Counting in fuel, the cost is 
not so much greater as we might suppose ; and comfort and 
convenience are increased. Under other conditions, even in 
the city, a different conclusion is reached. If coal is the fuel, 
and a steady fire is kept, perhaps in winter for heating pur- 
poses, then it is economy to cook most food materials at 
home. 

In the country and small village different conditions pre- 
vail. Here the abundance of certain fruits in season makes 
it economical to can and dry, even counting fuel and labor. 
In some sections many people can their own vegetables also. 
However, even in the country in the summer, it is a decided 
relief to the farmer's wife, probably short of " help," to win 
a little leisure by buying staple bakery products. Here if 
strict economy is not necessary, is it not better to save 
strength rather than money ? Each housekeeper must work 
out these problems for herself.

CHAPTER XVIII 

MENUS AND DIETARIES 1 

When we have learned to choose and cook wholesome and 
appetizing food we have not solved the whole problem of 
successful feeding. It is possible to make people sick with 
good food, if it is badly selected and fed at wrong times or in 
unsuitable amounts. Whether children grow to their full 
size and strength depends more upon the choice of their 
food than upon any other one thing. The effect of food is 
strikingly shown in the case of the white rats in Fig. 74. 
The two upper ones are the same age. Both had the same 
mother, lived in the same kind of clean cages, and had plenty 
of food, but the diet of the upper was good for growth, while 
that for the middle one was not. It remained perfectly well, 
but became stunted because of the character of its food. You 
can see that it resembles the lowest one in the illustration, 
which is only one fourth as old. In this chapter we shall 
consider how and when and in what amounts to serve food 
so that every one may get from it the fullest benefit in both 
health and happiness. 

In Chapter I we learned that the body is a working machine 
whose first requirement is fuel. Hence the first considera- 
tion in the diet is to have the proper amount of fuel for each 
day, to provide energy for the constant internal work that 
keeps the body alive, and for the variable external work

which may be so light as to consist of the few movements 
that one makes lying in bed, or sitting quietly ; or so hard 
as to exercise many muscles, as playing tennis, bicycling, or 
swimming. 

Energy requirements of adults. — We have also learned 
something about the foods which supply this energy; we 
must now find out how much fuel (in the form of food) it 
takes to do different amounts of work, just as the owner of 
an automobile wants to know how much gasoline per mile 
or per hour is required to run his machine under different 
conditions. Very careful experiments have been made on 
many men in different ways to measure their energy output,

the most accurate and interesting being those made in a 
respiration calorimeter, a device so delicate as to be able to 
measure the extra heat given off when one changes from lying 
perfectly quiet to sitting up equally still, thus adding the 
work of holding the upper part of the body upright. A 
respiration calorimeter large enough to hold a child is shown 
in Figs. 75 and 76. You can see that it consists of a chamber

which will help to get the exact amount of heat given off 
from the body is employed. 

Just as it takes more fuel to run a big machine than a 
little one, so it takes more energy for a large person than a 
small one; therefore we must know the weight of the one 
whose food requirements we wish to calculate, as well as the 
amount of energy required to do different kinds and amounts 
of work. The following table will help in calculating the 
approximate fuel requirements of any grown person. The 
food needs of children and young people under twenty-five 
will be discussed later.

At active muscular exercise 2.0

Light exercise may be understood to include work equiv- 
alent to standing and working with the hands, as at a desk 
in chemistry or cookery ; or work involving the feet like walk- 
ing or running a sewing machine. Many persons, as stu- 
dents, stenographers, seamstresses, bookkeepers, teachers, and 
tailors do little or no work heavier than this. 

Active exercise involves more muscles, as in bicycling 
compared with walking, or exercise with dumb-bells as com- 
pared with typewriting. Carpenters, general houseworkers, 
and mail carriers do about this grade of work while on duty. 

Severe exercise not only involves a good many muscles, 
but causes enough strain to harden and enlarge them. Bicy- 
cling up grade, swimming, and other active sports would be 
included in this kind of exercise. Lumbermen, excavators, 
and a few others do even heavier work than this. 



300 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Knowing the weight of a grown man or woman, and some- 
thing of the daily occupation, as in the case of a professional 
man, we can estimate the probable energy requirement 
somewhat as follows : 

Sleeping, 8 tours ; 8 X 0.4 Calories = 3.2 Calories per pound. 
Sitting quietly (at meals, reading, etc.), 8 hours ; 8 X 0.6 Calories 

= 4.2 per pound. 
At light muscular exercise (dressing, standing, walking, etc.), 

6 X 1.0 Calories = 6.0 Calories per pound 
At active muscular exercise 2 hours, 2 X 2.0 Calories 

= 4 Calories per pound. 

Total Calories per pound for 24 hours, 17.4 ; 17.4 X 154 
pounds (the weight of the average man) = 2679.8, or 
2680, Calories per day required. Calculate in this way the 
energy requirement for various grown persons whom you 
know. 

Energy requirements during growth. — In estimating food 
requirements of those who are under twenty-five years old, 
we must bear in mind that the same materials which serve 
for fuel serve in part for building material. Protein is used 
for muscle building as well as for supplying energy, and the 
larger one grows, the greater the reserves of carbohydrate 
and fat which he can carry. Furthermore, internal activity 
is greater in the young than the middle aged or very old, and 
external activity is apt also to be greater. Think, for in- 
stance, how much running children do compared with their 
parents. For all these reasons, we cannot use the table for 
adults in calculating the energy requirement of young people. 
In the following table an attempt has been made to take ac- 
count of their greater needs, but the estimates include only 
moderate exercise; with hard work more will be required. 
Notice that the highest allowance per pound of body weight 
is for the youngest children. ,

With these two tables for calculating energy requirement 
we can determine about how much will be needed by -each 
member of the family. A group consisting of a professional 
man, his wife, and three children under 16 will require about 
10,000 Calories per day; a workingman's family with the 
same number of children from 12,000 to 14,000, because of 
the harder work which both parents and possibly the chil- 
dren will do. 

Protein requirement. — Since few of our foods consist 
of a single foodstuff, and we are not likely to make even a 
single meal on pure fat, or pure protein, or pure carbohydrate 
alone, we are sure to get some building material in any diet, 
but we must see to it that we are getting amounts which 
furnish the best possible conditions for growth and repair. 

As we have already seen, nitrogen in the form of protein 
is necessary to the life of every cell in the body. From pro- 
tein, too, muscle is built, though we cannot build good muscle 
merely by feeding protein ; a diet moderate in its amount of 
protein, but with plenty of fuel for healthy exercise is best 
for muscle building. Under all ordinary conditions, if ten 
to fifteen Calories in every hundred (10 to 15 per cent of the 
total Calories) are from protein, the need for this kind of 
building material will be met. Thus a family requiring 
10,000 Calories per day should have from 1000 to 1500 of 
these as protein Calories. The following table gives the pro-

Notice that some foods, like bread, have about the right 
proportion of protein calories ; others, like beef, beans, and 
peas are very high in protein calories. By combining some 
foods high in protein with others containing little or none, we 
can get the right proportion. Thus, 100 Calories of beef 
combined with 400 each of bread and butter will give 900 
Calories of which 114, or 12.7 per cent, are from protein.

It is interesting to work out other combinations which give 
these good proportions. 

Ash requirement. — We are also assured of ash in any ordi- 
nary diet, but some attention should be paid to kind and 
amount, especially as many common foods have lost the parts 
richest in ash. Patent flour, for instance, made from the 
inner part of the grain, is not so rich in ash as whole or cracked 
wheat. Valuable salts are also lost in cooking vegetables 
when the water in which they were cooked is thrown away. 
If not desired with the vegetable, this should be saved for 
gravy or soup. It is not necessary to calculate a definite 
amount of ash for the diet, if ash-bearing foods are freely 
used. By reference to the table on page 384 you can see what 
foods are valuable for supplying the important kinds of ash. 
Milk is particularly rich in calcium and hence is required 
when the bones are growing. Eggs have iron and phosphorus 
in forms well suited to growth. But if eggs are too expensive, 



304 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the vegetables and fruits generally will supply these same 
substances. 

Diet for growth. — Diets made in the chemical labora- 
tory from mixtures of pure (isolated) protein, fat, carbohy- 
drate, and ash to satisfy all the requirements which we have 
so far mentioned, do not behave alike when fed to animals. 
The kind of protein is important as well as the amount. 
This is shown by experiments in which only one protein is 
fed at a time. On some, the animals will not thrive. On 
others, adult animals do very well, but the young ones be- 
come stunted like the one shown on page 296. Milk has 
been found to contain proteins on which young animals can 
thrive. But even in diets containing the protein from milk, 
young animals do not develop normally unless the salts of 
milk are added too. No perfect substitute for milk has ever 
been found. During the first year of life, a child lives on it 
almost exclusively ; for the first five years it should be con- 
sidered the most important article in the diet ; and through- 
out the period of growth it should be freely used if children 
are to become vigorous men and women. If not liked as a 
beverage, it can be used in cocoa, or cereal coffee, in soups, 
puddings, and other dishes. Considering what milk may 
save in the way of more expensive protein foods, such as eggs 
and meat, and of ash-supplying foods like fruits and vege- 
tables, it is to be regarded as a cheap food. It is possible to 
get the proper amounts of fuel and protein from white bread 
and meat, but such a diet is poorly balanced as to ash con- 
stituents and especially lacks calcium. It would need to be 
balanced by adding some fruit or vegetable and even then 
would not contain as much calcium as is best for growing 
people. A diet of bread and milk, on the other hand, is so 
nearly perfectly balanced (supplying fuel, protein, and ash 
constituents in suitable amounts) that it can be taken ex- 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 305 

clusively for a long time. Whole wheat bread and milk 
would be even better, because the whole wheat would supply 
more iron, in which white bread and milk are not rich. The 
addition of fruits and vegetables to the bread and milk diet 
would also be an advantage — partly for the same reason. 

Other foods especially valuable for growth are eggs and 
cereals from whole grains. Children should acquire the 
habit of eating fruits and green vegetables of all kinds, for 
when they are older and likely to take less milk and cereals, 
the fruits and vegetables supply important ash constituents 
and also help to prevent constipation. 

The foods good for children are also good for adults, but 
the latter can keep their bodies in good repair with less 
protein and ash in proportion to body weight than are re- 
quired during growth, and many kinds of protein serve for 
repair. If there are not enough milk and eggs to go around, 
adults can take meat, nuts, peas, beans and bread for protein, 
and trust to these and fruit and vegetables for ash. When 
the body has been wasted by sickness, however, a return to 
the foods of growth, especially a diet of milk and eggs, is 
best for building it up again. 

The number of meals in a day. — Knowing how much and 
what kinds of food are best for each member of the family, 
we must next find out how to divide the total food for the 
day into meals. Few of us could take our required fuel in 
one meal, and if we could, we should probably be hungry 
before the time for the next meal. Some persons get along 
very well with two meals a day, but usually their fuel re- 
quirement is not high. Most people are more comfortable 
and more likely to eat a suitable amount in a deliberate 
fashion if they have three meals a day. When large amounts 
of fuel have to be taken, four or five meals may be better than 
three ; babies who have to eat in proportion to their size, 



306 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

often 2| times as much as their mothers, take 2\ times as 
many meals, i.e. 7 or 8 in a day. 

The amount of food for each meal. — While the number 
of meals depends largely on the amount to be eaten in the 
whole day, and the appetite of the subject, the amount at each 
meal is most influenced by the nature of the daily occupation. 
The baby with nothing to do but eat and sleep has meals 
uniform in kind and amount. The business man who works 
very hard through the middle of the day, and has not time 
to take an elaborate meal, nor time to rest after it so that it 
may digest easily, takes a light luncheon and makes up for it 
at breakfast and dinner. The outdoor worker who has a long 
hard day and expends much energy, takes an hour at noon for 
a substantial dinner, in addition to a hearty breakfast and 
supper and sometimes a mid-forenoon or mid-afternoon lunch. 

Regularity of meals. — More important than the number 
of meals is regularity as to time of eating and amount of 
food. Training for the digestive tract is just as important 
as training the eye or the hand or the brain. We cannot 
expect good digestions if we have a hearty luncheon to-day, 
none at all to-morrow, and perhaps a scanty and hasty late 
one the next day. To take food into the stomach between 
meals is to demoralize the digestive system. Foods that 
are excellent as part of a meal provoke headaches and bad 
complexions, and many symptoms of a protesting stomach, 
when taken between meals. The younger the person, the 
more important is regularity. Little children soon suffer if 
their meals are not " on the minute." Adults have more 
difficulty in controlling their time, but if they have to be 
late to meals, they should be more careful than usual to eat 
slowly and to choose plain simple food that will digest easily. 

Mental attitude toward meals. — Good food may be pro- 
vided at the proper time and yet the members of a family 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 307 

may fail to keep well and happy unless they come to meals 
in the right condition. Haste, chill, exhaustion, anxiety, 
excitement, fretfulness, or anger may interfere with the 
digestion of the most digestible of meals. Orderly table 
service, good manners, and cheerful conversation are very 
important factors in the success of a meal. Peace and joy 
as well as " calories" are watchwords of good nutrition. 

Balanced meals. — Having determined how many meals 
to serve in the day and what their hours shall be, the next 
question is how to choose and distribute the constituents of 
the day's ration so as to promote digestibility and satisfac- 
tion. A meal of pure protein, or fat, or carbohydrate would 
not be relished, and would have some physiological disad- 
vantages. Digestion is likely to be more complete on a 
mixed diet. A meal of carbohydrate alone leaves the stom- 
ach more quickly than any other kind, and one would feel 
hungry before the next meal, though one might have had 
plenty of fuel ; a meal of fat alone would leave the stomach 
very slowly, and one would not have so good an appetite 
for the next meal ; a meal of pure protein would stimulate 
heat production without any particular advantages, except 
possibly in very cold weather : it would be decidedly undesir- 
able in hot weather. For these and other reasons it is best 
to have the different foodstuffs represented in each meal, 
and to see that no one contains an excess of fat, which tends 
to retard all digestion. This is what is usually meant by a 
balanced meal, but it may also include care that about the 
same proportion of fuel is served at the same meal each day. 
A meal does not need to be " balanced " in quite the same 
sense as a day's ration. The latter must have a definite 
amount of fuel, a suitable proportion of protein, ash well 
represented, some food for bulk, the whole selected with 
regard for the physical condition, tastes, habits, and pocket- 
books of those to be fed. 



308 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Menus. — ■ Food taken at a stated time constitutes a meal. 
It may consist of a single food material, as bread, or a single 
dish, as soup; or it may contain many kinds of food and 
many dishes. When the day's ration consists of a single food, 
there is no trouble in arranging the bill of fare, for all meals 
are alike. But as soon as we have two foods, we may con- 
sider whether they will digest better if eaten together or 
separately, and which way they will please the palate better. 
Balanced diets do not necessarily afford attractive menus. 
Macaroni and oatmeal would make a fairly well balanced 
meal except as regards ash constituents, but no one would call 
such a combination pleasing. By the substitution of a little 
cheese and an orange for the oatmeal, a meal containing 
about the same fuel value and proportion of protein could be 
arranged, and it would certainly appeal more to the appetite, 
and furnish better proportions of ash constituents. 

In the construction of the menu for the day or meal, we 
must consider not only food values and time of day and com- 
binations which shall be digestible, but flavor, color, texture, 
and temperature of our foods. The study of digestible com- 
binations belongs to the science of nutrition. The harmoni- 
ous blending of tastes, odors, colors, and the like is an art. 
Just as there are pleasing combinations of sound, so there 
are harmonies of flavor; certain dishes seem naturally to 
"go together." Habit has a great deal to do with food 
combinations. A Chinaman would not eat sugar on rice; 
a Japanese would not cook beans with molasses as the Bos- 
tonian does. It is interesting to experiment with new com- 
binations, and study to find out why old ones are pleasing. 
Why do we like crackers with soup? Butter on bread? 
Toast with eggs? Peas with lamb chops? 

Digestible menus. — Some of our eating habits are worth 
preserving and cultivating. Fresh fruit for breakfast stimu- 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 309 

lates the appetite and helps to prevent or overcome constipa- 
tion. A mild-flavored food like cereal is better relished be- 
fore we have had meats or other highly flavored food. Soup 
at the beginning of a meal puts the stomach in better condi- 
tion to digest the food that follows. Ice cream at the end 
of a meal is less likely to chill the stomach than at the be- 
ginning. Bread and butter afford a good combination of 
fat and carbohydrate. Crackers help in the breaking up of 
cheese into particles easy to digest. 

Not all of our eating habits are good, however. Griddle- 
cakes, melted butter, and maple sirup taste good, but the 
cakes make a pasty mass difficult for digestive juices to pene- 
trate. The sirup is likely to ferment, and the butter coating 
the whole delays digestion greatly. Chicken salad is popu- 
lar, but combinations of protein with much fat (as in the 
mayonnaise dressing) always digest very slowly. Simple 
dishes, without rich sauces or gravies, and not excessively 
high in fat, are easiest of digestion. Pastries, fried foods, 
meats with much fat, like pork and sausage, are always more 
or less difficult and should be attempted only by the strong, 
or when the body is free from physical or nervous weariness, 
and not about to undertake mental work. 

Attention to the art of menu making not only helps to 
make the diet easier to digest, but also better balanced. 
Foods which are similar in color, flavor, and texture, like 
potatoes and rice, are not artistic in combination, and it is 
better to substitute for one of them a green vegetable, or 
meat or butter, in which case we get a better balance, as 
more ash, protein, or fat would then be included with the 
starch of the rice or potato. 

In making the bill of fare it is a great mistake to consider 
each meal by itself alone. If we do so, some days are likely 
to be very high in fuel, while others may be very low. Then, 



310 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



too, the impression left from one meal carries over to the next. 
We do not care to see on the dinner table the same foods that 
we saw at luncheon. Our love of variety is one of nature's 
ways of seeing to it that we get different kinds of foodstuffs in 
our diet. Variety stimulates appetite, but this does not 
mean a great variety at one meal. The truest variety is ob- 
tained by a few well-selected dishes at each meal. If we do not 
exhaust our resources on one meal, we shall be able to have a 
greater range of foods in the course of a week. A hotel may 
have fifty or sixty items on its bill of fare, but after a few days 
one feels as if there were a great sameness, because all of 
them are impressed on the mind at each meal and every day. 

Dietaries. — A dietary, as we shall use the term here, 1 is 
a statement of the food requirements of a person or group of 
persons for a day or some other definite length of time, with 
a selection of foods to satisfy this requirement. 

The first part of a family dietary will have to be calculated 
according to the age, weight, and occupation, as stated on 
pages 299-303. When complete, it will stand somewhat like 
this :

1 Observations of the food eaten by individuals or groups of people are 
also called dietary studies, whether the observed dietary is such as to satisfy 
the food requirement or not. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 311 

In selecting food to satisfy these requirements it is a good 
plan to make first a list of those foods that need to be in- 
cluded in the day's dietary, no matter what the particular 
menu may be. This will include foods for growth where 
there are children, special dishes needed if any one is sick, 
and those common foods which we are accustomed to include 
in every day's menu, such as bread and butter. 

For the family which we are considering, this list will stand 
somewhat as follows : 

Food 100-Calorie Portions 

Milk 20 1 (6 for each child, the rest 

for the adults) 

Cereal 5 

Eggs (for children) . . . . 2 (counting I portion per egg) 

Fruit ... . ... 5 

Green vegetable . . . 2 

Meat or meat substitute . . 5 

Bread 15 

Butter 15 

This list is to be kept in planning the menu, whose char- 
acter is further determined by certain dishes which we wish 
particularly to have inducted. For instance, we may desire 
roast beef for dinner. This is a highly flavored meat, and a 
protein food which will go a long way towards satisfying the 
adult's protein needs. Special protein food for breakfast 
may well be omitted, or take the form of eggs, which are a 
contrast to the meat in flavor, form, etc. Protein food for 
luncheon might be fish or some other meat substitute. 

Vegetables for dinner should not only harmonize with the 
meat, but contrast pleasingly with each other. This result 
is insured by choosing one vegetable from the starchy type, 
as potatoes or sweet potatoes, and the other vegetable of the 
green or succulent group, as spinach or asparagus. 

Below are two menus, in which have been kept in mind the

314 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

It is evident that we have enough protein, and as a good 
share of it is from milk, we know that it will satisfy the 
children's requirements in the best possible way. The adults 
will get theirs largely from the salmon and meat. Compar- 
ing this list with our first tentative one, we find that we 
have used in building up our dietary 21 portions of milk, 
5 of cereal, 5 of fruit (not including lemon juice), 4.1 of green 
vegetable, 8 of meat (including salmon), 18 of bread, and 22 
of butter, but no eggs. We have a good representation of the 
different kinds of foodstuffs, with this exception, and as the 
boys would need the eggs most, we could put them in for 
their breakfast, thus adding about 140 total Calories and 50 
protein Calories. With this addition we are still slightly 
deficient in total energy, but to add one or two hundred 
Calories is a very simple matter. A second serving of pota- 
toes, an extra roll for those whose fuel requirement is highest, 
or a slightly more liberal use of butter, might well solve the 
problem. This dietary calculation shows how the menu 
may help in getting a balanced diet, and how knowledge of 
food values can be applied as a check on the menu. If we 
had had fewer dishes in each meal, we should have had to 
plan to serve larger portions of sorne or all of them, or to use 
more freely such staples as bread, butter, and milk. 

Each family must find out the kind of menu best suited 
to its resources. Some typical meal plans suitable for 
everyday use are given below.

The cost of the dietary. — The types of menu used will 
depend very largely upon the income of the family. It is 
comparatively easy to plan attractive bills of fare if one does 
not have to consider the amount of work involved in prepar- 
ing them, or the cost of the materials to be used. With 
knowledge of food values an expensive dietary may be whole- 
some, but there is great temptation to overeating and waste 
of food, and it is wise to keep meals simple for the sake of 
good digestion. Most families have to consider carefully 
the cost of food if any money is to be saved for books or 
travel or emergencies. A dietary such as planned on page 
313 will probably cost from $1.50 to $2.00 for the day, or 
from \\ to 2 cents per 100 Calories, depending on the locality. 
Nothing is allowed for waste, which may, if the cook and those 
who eat the food are not careful, amount to from 10 to 15 



316 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

per cent of the total cost. It is often estimated that the 
" average " man will consume about 3000 Calories per day, 
and the cost may be expressed on this basis as from 45 to 
60 cents per man per day ; or the dietary spoken of as a 45- 
cent or 60-cent dietary or whatever the exact cost per 3000 
Calories may be. The cost of food for such a family for a 
year would at this rate be from $550 to $750. 

If the allowance for food be placed at 25 per cent of the 
total income, 1 this dietary would be appropriate for a family 
with an income of $2200 to $3000 per year. The majority 
of families have to get along with a lower expenditure for 
food, yet they want to be well nourished and to enjoy their 
fare. Fortunately there is no real connection between cost 
and nutritive value, some of the most nutritious foods being 
among the cheapest. At the same time, we cannot get 
wholesome food for nothing. There are very few foods which 
to-day cost less than ^ of a cent per 100 Calories, and these 
are mostly cereal products, such as commeal, rolled oats, 
and flour, or sugars and molasses. These alone will not 
make a well-balanced, palatable dietary, though they will 
supply all the fuel needed for an " average " man for a day 
for ten cents. In many parts of the country to-day it is 
hardly possible to make a dietary satisfactory week in and 
week out with an average allowance of less than | of a cent 
per 100 Calories, and even this sum will prove satisfactory 
only provided there be skill in food preparation as well as 
food selection. With an allowance of 1 cent per 100 Calories 
it is possible almost anywhere to make a balanced dietary 
with some attractiveness in appearance and flavor. In 

1 The apportionment of the income to the different expenses of living 
(food, clothing, shelter, etc.) is discussed in Chapter XIX. It will be found 
that the smaller the income the higher is the percentage of it which must 
be allowed for food.

choosing foods with regard to cost a table that shows which 
are cheap fuel and which dear, is a great help. Prices vary 
so much with place and season that it is difficult to make 
one which is very exact, and some rearrangement to suit 
any particular region may be necessary. The table on page 
317 will, however, serve as a guide. 

Inspection of this table shows that if we can afford only 
one cent per 100 Calories for food, we must get a large share 
from Group I, and a few from Group II ; if we wish to use 
foods in Group III, we shall have to do so sparingly, or offset 
them with some of the very cheapest in Group I, to keep the 
average as we wish it. 

When we plan an attractive menu and find it is too ex- 
pensive for us, we may often carry out our plan by substitut- 
ing cheaper foods of the same sort. Thus in the dietary on 
page 313 we may substitute as follows : 

Bananas for oranges. ; 

Top milk for cream. 

Oleomargarine for a part of the butter. 

Bean loaf with tomato sauce for creamed salmon and peas. 

Stewed apricots for pears. 

Rump roast instead of rib roast. 
Doing this, omitting the soup and crackers and the salad 
for dinner, and increasing bread and potatoes, flaked wheat, 
and other cheaper foods to prevent any deficiency in fuel, 
we can still prepare palatable and digestible meals with the 
right food values, and save perhaps 25 per cent on the total 
cost for the day. 

Feeding the sick. — When illness is serious enough for a 
physician to be consulted, he will give directions concerning 
the diet, and these should be scrupulously followed. If the 
case is so severe as to demand a trained nurse, she will have 
charge of the feeding, under the physician's guidance. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 319 

Many times, however, a member of the family is temporarily 
indisposed and needs food different from the ordinary family 
bill of fare. It is well to remember that in the first day or 
two of illness, fasting or taking of very little food does no 
harm, and may be an excellent help toward recovery, as it 
gives the digestive tract a chance to rest, if it has been 
disturbed. 

Nevertheless, the internal work of the body goes on, 0.4 
Calorie per pound per hour being expended during sleep, and 
about 0.6 Calorie per pound per hour during waking hours 
in bed. A person in bed for twenty-four hours will require 
about 0.5 Calorie per pound per hour to prevent use of body 
material for fuel. A man of average weight, lying in bed, 
will thus need about 1850 calories per day. Hence we must 
see to it, that after a person has been sick for more than a 
few days (during which he can afford to burn body fat) enough 
fuel is given to satisfy his energy requirements if he can pos- 
sibly digest it. 

Food for an invalid must always be given in its most diges- 
tible forms. Milk is one of the most valuable foods in sick- 
ness, not only because it supplies so many body needs, but 
because it can be used in so many ways, — hot, or cold, 
flavored or plain, made into junkets or sherbets, combined 
with eggs in eggnogs and custards, fermented as in kumyss 
or soured as in buttermilk or zoolak. In some form or other 
milk can almost always be made digestible. Eggs are also 
of great value, not only poached or dropped and served on 
toast, but as dainty omelets, or in beverages, as eggnog, egg 
lemonade, and orangeade. Mild fruit juices, as orange, 
grape, or pineapple, are not only refreshing but of considerable 
fuel value. If there is no fever, chicken, lamb chops, tender 
broiled steak or roast beef may serve to add variety to the 
menu. Broths stimulate the appetite and help digestion, 



320 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

though they are of little or no food value themselves. Cereals, 
eggs, and milk may be added to increase their food value. 
Cereals in the form of gruels or delicate puddings, as corn- 
starch blancmange and tapioca cream, are easily digested. 
Vegetables are best given rather sparingly, and only delicate, 
mild-flavored ones, such as spinach or asparagus, if digestion 
is much disturbed. In getting an invalid to take sufficient 
food, much depends upon the attractiveness of the service. 
Remember that very little things, like a fingermark on a 
glass, or coffee spilled into the saucer, may take away appetite 
and prevent enough food being eaten. Food in small quan- 
tities and taken at more frequent intervals than in health 
helps towards the best results. Knowledge of what particular 
diet is best in different diseases comes only through careful 
study of the science of nutrition after much study of chem- 
istry and physiology.

CHAPTER XIX 
THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 

The divisions of the income for which we should provide 
are food, shelter, including taxes and operating expenses, 
clothing, and the " higher life," including recreation, educa- 
tion, and savings. The size of the income determines largely 
the proportion of money allotted to each division. We 
must be nourished and protected from the elements by shel- 
ter and clothing, and an income must at least provide for these 
necessities to be a living wage. Yet we justly claim some- 
thing more from our income than mere existence. 

In most families there is a fairly definite income. When 
the amount is not known it is wise to estimate upon the 
minimum income and have a surplus, rather than to expend 
too much. Seventy-five years ago things cost less and in- 
comes were less, to-day the incomes have increased and cost 
of living is growing higher. The question is one to be 
studied relatively, and the cost of living will depend on the 
ratio between income and one's methods of living. 

Just what other satisfactions than the merely physical 
are to be gratified is the great question for the woman who 
divides the income. The problem is naturally hardest with 
the smallest income, where the " must be " crowds out the 
" may be." But there is room for choice even with the small 
wage. 

This work of dividing the income and deciding on the ideals 
should be shared by the family. When the home is first 
started the husband and wife should discuss frankly the prob- 
t 321 



322 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

lems of division and should agree on the methods of expen- 
diture. This common understanding between members of a 
family forms a bond of union, and each feels a greater pleas- 
ure and pride in doing his part. The fact that there is a 
budget and a system brings orderliness in methods of work 
and freedom from worry and anxiety as well as a saving of 
money. And this saving of money and strength is the same 
as an increase in income. This budget or division of ex- 
penses acts as a sailing chart and can be referred to from 
month to month. It should not, however, become a burden, 
and one should not worry if every penny is not accounted for. 

Statisticians tell us that about 75 per cent of the male 
adults of our country earn somewhat less than $600 a year. 
That in large cities $900 to $1000 a year is necessary to bring 
up a family to live decently and enjoy human happiness. 
Much depends upon how this income is divided as to whether 
results will tend to develop efficiency in the members of such 
a family. As the income increases from $1000 to $5000 it is 
possible to apportion the income and indicate certain per- 
centages which represent wise family expenditures so as to 
include the higher intellectual and emotional life as well as 
the physical welfare of the family. 

From comparison of many budgets statisticians have 
worked out certain percentages that are helpful in making 
our decisions, although they are not to be taken as fixed rules. 

Expenditure for food. — On examining the budgets of 
families having incomes from $500 to $5000, it is found that 
the percentage spent for food increases as the income de- 
creases, amounting sometimes to at least 50 per cent of the in- 
come. This means that there i.s a limit to the money spent 
per capita per day for food, below which we cannot go and 
maintain life with even sufficient efficiency for unskilled labor. 
Figure 77 shows that a $900 income gives about 45 per cent to 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 



323 



food. An expenditure of thirty cents per capita per day for 
food in a family of five with an income of $1500, is 36.5 per 
cent ; i.e. more than 'one third of the total income. Sug-

come, and highly important with the larger where we are prone 
to yield to a foolish impulse to please a whim of the palate. 

Expenditure for shelter. — The increased cost of building 
and the general advance in rentals make the expenditure for 
shelter a large one. 

The question whether homes should be owned or rented is 
a vital one. Ownership is possible for comparatively few, 
but there is probably nothing that contributes more to the 
upbuilding of a community and the development of good 
citizenship than the permanent residence of families in 
localities. The pride of the members is enlisted in the home, 
its surroundings and general community welfare. This 
sense of ownership makes a house more a home although real 
home spirit is not confined to ownership of buildings. There 
are of course advantages and disadvantages of ownership, 
and these should be carefully weighed. Preference for fresh 
air, more space, less crowded conditions even if they necessi- 
tate daily travel, have driven people of limited incomes and 
certain ideals from the crowded cities to the suburbs in search 
of homes. When it is possible it is certainly much more 
advantageous to own than to rent a home, when living means 
the attainment of certain ideals in the fives of the members of 
the family. 

In deciding upon the proper expenditure, we must take 
into account the location, whether convenient to business, 
school, and church, sanitary conditions in surroundings and 
in the house or apartment, the appearance of the house and 
the attractiveness of the neighborhood as well as its con- 
venience and healthfulness. The house should be adapted 
to the needs of the family and selected with this thought in 
mind. See the companion volume, "Shelter and Clothing," 
Chapters II and III. 

It has been estimated that 20 per cent of incomes ranging 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 325 

from $500 to $5000 will secure a home, not including operat- 
ing expenses, with the proper sanitary conditions and one 
which will contribute to a right standard of living. If neces- 
sary to secure healthful surroundings more than 20 per cent 
may need to be spent, but 25 per cent of the income is the 
limit of the amount to be spent upon rent unless this also 
includes heat (as in many apartments) when as much as 
28 per cent may be so spent. If more than this is paid, it is 
practically impossible to avoid debt when any unforeseen 
contingency arises. One thrifty German woman used 30 
per cent of the small family income for rent, in order to have 
more bedrooms than most tenement-house dwellers can 
afford. She did make ends meet by working until midnight 
at the family sewing, and tailoring ; but though she was the 
very soul of thrift in regard to food, and had never' called 
in a doctor, she could not save money until the children' 
began to earn. 

Operating expenses. — The question of operating expense 
is closely associated with the selection of shelter and should 
be carefully considered with it in the division of the income. 
They are the expenses necessary to keep the house clean, 
warm, lighted, insured, and in constant repair. To these 
must be added in a suburban community water tax, property 
tax, perhaps even a fire tax. 

In city apartments, heat and hot water are often furnished, 
and this must be taken into account in deciding between 
apartment and house, and between renting and ownership. 

Labor is an important item in the running of the house. 
The close connection of selecting and operating a home will 
be seen. Should the administrator divide the family income 
in such a way that little is left for operating, the little things 
of everyday life become a constant source of worry. 

The questions of the number of rooms, and their care, 



326 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

relative expense of heating by furnace, steam, or hot water, 
the cost of regular service in wages per week in order to 
attain one's ideals, the cost of extra service, the lighting by 
gas, oil, or electricity are all problems of operating. Knowl- 
edge of sanitary science will make the homemaker demand 
cleanliness in her surroundings, quick disposal of waste, and 
the prompt removal of dust. Much care in planning is 
necessary here in order that there may be no leakage and that 
there may be the full share of comfort for each member. 

For the income of from $500 to $5000 it has been estimated 
that a proportion of from 10 to 20 per cent must usually be 
spent for operating in order to secure comfort. Much must 
necessarily depend upon the amount of hired service required, 
which, in turn, depends largely upon whether the homemaker 
is to give her time chiefly to the care of her children or chiefly 
to the conduct of the housework. 

Clothing. — A large proportion of the family income is 
spent on clothing. A knowledge of textiles and of purchasing 
is necessary in order to do this, wisely and economically. 
Clothing is as necessary an expense as food, for it con- 
serves the heat which the food furnishes and thus main- 
tains body temperature. Health is the main factor in 
efficiency, and health is preserved by clothing which protects 
the body from sudden changes in temperatures, and con- 
serves the energy for other purposes. Money should be 
spent on clothing to secure health, but too often more than 
the right percentage of income is expended because of love 
of display. The instinct for show, color, ornamentation 
is a primitive one, and the aesthetic " want " is, in one sense, 
as real as the physical and should be considered in expendi- 
tures for this purpose. It is a duty to look well, but it is not 
necessary, nor does it show good sense, to sacrifice the health, 
happiness, and higher life of the family by economizing on 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 327 

food and other essentials in order to secure hats, shoes, gowns, 
and accessories that cater to a mania for show. If the in- 
come be limited so that the essentials of clothing only can 
be purchased, the margin of income which can be spent for 
pleasure may, if taste so dictates, be spent on clothing instead 
of pictures, books, or some recreation. That is a matter for 
the individual or family to decide. In the typical budgets 
cited below it will be seen that the expenditure for clothing 
was usually between 10 and 18 per cent. 

The higher life. — There are other needs of family life 
for which money must be spent besides the material ones of 
food, shelter, and clothing. In the division of some family 
incomes little thought is given to this phase of living. After 
the income reaches a certain amount, it is possible so to plan 
that education, recreation, philanthropy, and savings all 
figure in the division of expenditures. Some writers say 
that 25 per cent of the income of $1000 to $5000 should be 
spent in this way. If thought is given to this, it would mean 
opportunities for books, periodicals, lectures, and member- 
ship in societies; some travel and vacation, social clubs, 
theaters and concerts ; charity and church expenditures ; 
life insurance and other savings. It is the idea of ownership 
of property, of homes, of possessions of all kinds that has 
led from primitive living to advanced civilization. And 
with advanced civilization comes the need for the higher life 
which should be satisfied and can be through wise division 
of funds. The choice of things to satisfy this higher life rests 
with the individual ; it may be music, it may be the culti- 
vation of altruistic feeling in the help given to neighbors; 
it may be a bank account for some future good, or money 
spent on excursions, lectures, or theater. Whatever it is, it 
satisfies the emotional, spiritual, and intellectual life of man 
and distinguishes him as one of advanced civilization. 



328 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Savings. — • Something should be saved yearly even if at 
first it is but little. Small amounts put away regularly in a 
savings bank mount up to a considerable sum at compound 
interest, for regular saving is the only kind that counts. Life 
and sickness insurance are other forms of saving. 

Allowances. — Each member of the family should have a 
personal allowance, even though it is small. One mother 
gave each of her children five cents a week, beginning at five 
years of age, and increasing a cent a week each year, until they 
were old enough to be trusted with more. Even at this age 
opposite characteristics showed themselves. One boy saved 
his allowance until he had a quarter to spend at one time ; 
another was in debt before the end of the week. Each had 
a bank, and kept accounts, as well. It is sometimes better 
for a child if he " earns " his allowances by performance of 
such household duties as seem best adapted to promote his 
development. 

Suggested and typical budgets. — In preparation for the 
division of one's income it is helpful to study the budgets of 
other families or individuals. Mrs. Richards in her book on 
" The Cost of Living " gives a theoretical division of in- 
comes, which is shown in the accompanying table headed 
Suggested Budgets. It is interesting to study this account 
and then those of families who have worked out their prob- 
lems (either with or without the preparation of definite 
budgets in advance) as shown in the table of Typical 
Budgets. 

In New York City it has been estimated by those studying 
the problems of the cost of living of to-day that it is im- 
possible for the average family of mother, father, and three 
children under 14 years to get food enough to keep the 
body in good condition with clothing and shelter to meet 
the most urgent demands of decency for less than $900. 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET

This amount in other localities would probably buy more. 
This means that in New York City for $900 a family of five 
can have a very bare existence, and that with $1000 this 
family can begin to maintain a decent standard of living 
unless there is long sickness or other catastrophe. At $1200 
a normal family standard can be maintained so as to preserve 
health, and so that the family will have opportunities to 
develop in a self-respecting manner. When one con- 
siders that many families subsist on $500 or $600 a year, 
it is necessarily under conditions of shelter and with 
limitations of food and clothing, not conducive to the best 
development.

CHAPTER XX 

SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 

The housekeeper should learn to use the labor-saving de- 
vices for her records that are now employed so largely in the 
world of business. This equipment should include a desk 
with fittings for systematized and rapid work. A roll-top 
desk, with pigeonholes and drawers is convenient, but a flat- 
topped desk with drawers below gives a larger space for 
writing, although it has to be supplemented by boxes to take 
the place of pigeonholes. Such desks may be purchased for 
twenty dollars and upward, in woods to match other furni- 
ture. It is a pleasure to have artistic desk furnishings, but a 
large amount may be spent on these, and the desk still be un- 
equipped for practical purposes. 

Files and loose-leaf books. — A card file is as advantageous 
to the housekeeper as to the business man. Some desks 
contain a place for the card file in the upper right-hand drawer. 

Guide cards are furnished in several colors to indicate 
divisions of the file, and these are plain, or with printed 
numbers and letters. The record cards also are made of 
several colors, to indicate different uses. The suggestions 
here cover only a few of the possibilities. Visit some office 
furnishing department or shop to see what an array of con- 
veniences has been devised for the dispatch of business. If 
you once form the habit, you will find new uses for the card 
file almost daily, and will keep on the cards, addresses, en- 
gagements, cash accounts, shopping lists, inventories of 

332 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 333 

clothing and furnishings, menus and recipes. A loose-leaf 
book is preferred by some people for inventories and accounts. 

A letter file shaped like a pocketbook can be purchased for 
only twenty-five cents, and will serve the purpose for a small 
correspondence. Large files with guide cards are made for a 
larger correspondence. 

The small file will answer for fifing bills and is useful also 
for clippings. Some desks have bill files in the pigeonholes, 
and a letter file in one of the large drawers. 

Have regular hours daily for attending to work at the 
desk, stated times for planning menus, making shopping 
lists, looking over the inventories, recording expenditures, 
and balancing accounts. 

Order in time and place are studied further in the chapter 
on Housewifery. 

Keeping of accounts. — This has been called by many, 
drudgery and tedious routine. Many business men go 
through much such drudgery to attain their goals, why should 
not the housewife be willing to make a similar sacrifice in 
her home for the sake of the service she is rendering the 
members of her household ? The aim in keeping the accounts 
is to register the amounts spent for various purposes so that 
all phases of life will be considered and so that the manager 
will be able to profit the second year because of the expe- 
rience of the first year. This makes housekeeping interesting 
and businesslike. The expenditure is made to produce the 
maximum of value received and is accompanied by the 
greatest possible pleasure. 

In keeping accounts there should be some method of show- 
ing the receipts and expenses, the income and the outgo, so 
that a balance can be made at any time. The items should 
be so listed, too, that it is possible to tell what expenditure 
has been made for any one item, as rent, or food, or other 



334 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

necessities. It is only in this way that the accounts become 
of value for future use. 

There are many ways of keeping such accounts. The 
simplest one for the housewife is the best if it shows the 
points mentioned above. The envelope system is used by 
some when the income is small, and a certain amount of 
money according to budget plan is put in labeled en- 
velopes for various purposes, as rent, food, operating ex- 
penses, etc. As sums are drawn from the various envelopes, 
a slip of paper put in the particular envelope registers the 
amount drawn. It is easy at the end of the month to balance 
the accounts. This system necessitates the presence of a 
good deal of money on hand, and sometimes of confusion of 
accounts, if money is borrowed from one envelope for use 
in another. 

Various systems of card catalogues, journals, and ledgers 
are in use, and all have more or less value. The simplest form 
for the average young woman or housewife can be kept in 
an ordinary blank book and the spaces ruled according to 
one's need. The account book can be started in somewhat 
the following manner, with the dates of expenditures in the 
first column and the respective amounts opposite under their

proper heads. In this way it is possible by using double 
pages of the blank book to keep all the items for each month 
in horizontal series. The columns for items of expenses 
should be ruled as needed, but it is desirable to keep them 
under as few heads as will suffice to give the information 
which may be desired. The use of the double page is ad- 
visable, for then the outer edge of the left-hand page can be 
used for the dates of purchase and plenty of room for columns 
of expense left across the two pages. The total in the various 
columns can be easily calculated at the end of the first month 
and a new set of pages ruled for the second. The expendi- 
' tures should be entered daily so as not to be forgotten. A 
slip of paper kept in one's purse is of help if amounts are 
jotted down while one is shopping. The totals for each 
month should be entered in another part of the blank book. 
Rule spaces for the year with columns for the months across 
the page and items of expense corresponding to those in the 
daily entry at the left-hand side. In this way at the end of 
twelve months the totals for each item of expense can be easily 
found. If one desires to know from day to day of a month 
how the balance stands, it is possible to add to Form I two 
columns for this purpose. One column should show the in-

come or amounts received with dates, and the second the 
total sum expended each day. This sum is found by adding 
the expense of each item across the page for the day and 
entering in the expense column. 

Somewhere in the book there should be kept an account 
of the receipts from all sources. The balance of the yearly 
expense account with the sheet of receipt can be easily made. 

Some plan must be made for showing which purchases are 
paid for in cash, and which are charged. A simple method 
is to record the articles charged, with the place, date, and 
price on a card in the card file in a division kept for this pur- 
pose, and labeled " Purchases charged." When the bill is 
rendered, it can be checked up from these cards, and the 
purchases entered in the permanent account book. The 
record in the account book gives thus the date of payment,

Totals 



but not the date of purchase, unless this is added too. The 
date of purchase can be recorded in the inventory of house- 
hold goods (see Chapter XXII) . 

This simple method of keeping accounts enables one to 
look over the monthly and yearly expenses and to see if the 
expenditure is apportioned to the different divisions as it 
should be. If some of the needs of the physical or intellectual 
life are being neglected, it should be possible to cut down or 
readjust the next year to the satisfaction both of the house- 
wife and of her family. 

It is wise for all girls before they have homes of their own 
to keep account of their own small incomes. In many 
families daughters are given money for clothing and daily 
expenses. Some such system of keeping accounts as the 
above can be used. It is astonishing in examining ac- 



338 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

counts for clothing, to see how few maintain a correct balance. 
One girl found, by keeping accounts, that she spent entirely 
too much for hats and gloves and did not have the proper 
underwear to protect her body and maintain the correct 
temperature for health. Accounts help us to determine 
whether our methods of living measure up to the ideals or 
standards of life which we have established in order to live 
rightly. 

Methods of payment. — Payment is either immediate, 
known as " spot cash," or deferred. If deferred, the articles 
purchased are charged by the dealer, and a bill rendered the 
first of each month. When a charge account is opened, a 
good business reference must be given. According to another 
system, articles may be paid for in installments, — that is, 
so much each month, according to some agreement. Of 
this method it may be said that it is unsafe, or at least 
unwise, always. Remember that more is always paid in 
the end. 

In either case the payment may be made in bills, specie, 
or by checks; although in ordinary shopping immediate 
payment is usually made in bills and specie. 

The advantage of immediate payment is that the buyer 
spends only what she has, and does not count on future 
money. This method of payment enables one to keep the 
balance well in hand. It necessitates, however, keeping 
bills and specie in the house, and in one's pocketbook, with 
the possibility of theft or loss ; and cash payment takes more 
time in the shop, with the long wait for change. Sending 
" collect on delivery " (C.O.D.) is a way of making cash 
payment and saving time at the shop. Be sure that in this 
case there is the exact change at home, and some one ready to 
receive the goods. 

Charging goods makes for economy of time. If you can 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 339 

remember that an article charged means money spent, this is 
a safe plan. One careful buyer says that she is too optimistic 
to have a charge account; too sure that while she has not 
cash enough to-day for something that she wants, she will 
surely have it by the first of next month. 

There is another method of payment introduced by a few 
large department stores. The firm requires a monthly de- 
posit at the first of each month and, charges up purchases 
against this. This is good in so far that the customer is 
spending money that he really has, but it restricts purchases 
to that one shop, and this is inadvisable in the case of a small 
income. 

The bank account and check book. — Whether payment 
is immediate or deferred, payment by check is a great con- 
venience. It saves time and is also a record of money paid. 

Select a bank, conveniently located, and recommended by 
a conservative business man. Take to the bank a letter of 
introduction, with the sum for deposit. The bank will 
record your signature, and give you a bank book in which is 
recorded the amount deposited. A check book will be given 
you that contains blank checks, and provides for keeping ac- 
count of deposits and checks drawn. Each check has to 
be filled in, and signed with your name exactly as recorded at 
the bank, when you make a payment. This must be re- 
corded in the proper place when the check is made out, stating 
date, amount, and payee. The sums paid out are added, 
.usually for every three checks, and this sum deducted from 
the deposit, and the balance carried forward. In this way 
you may always know your balance in the bank, provided 
you are accurate. Great care must be taken to fill in the 
blank spaces correctly so that the check cannot be easily 
altered by any one. 

If a check is made out to you, and you wish to cash it, or 



340 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

deposit it, you " indorse " it by writing your name on the 
back across the left-hand end of the check. The name must 
be written exactly as it appears on the face of the check. 
If by chance the name is misspelled, write it in with the cor- 
rect spelling below. 

The checks that you make out are indorsed by the payee 
in the same way, and cannot be cashed until so indorsed. 
Therefore, if a check is lost in the mail, you do not lose the 
money. The bank should be notified to " stop payment " 
on the lost check, and you can then send another check in 
place of the first one. 

When you wish bills or specie, you go to the bank and 
present to the paying teller a check made out to " Cash " 
and signed by yourself. It is wise not to make out or sign 
such a check until you reach the bank, because if such a 
check is lost on the way, there is danger of its being cashed 
by the finder. 

Once a month you should leave the book with the teller 
to be balanced. In a few days you may call for it, and will 
receive with it the checks that you have drawn, and that have 
been returned to the bank by the date to which the book is 
balanced. These checks are called vouchers. With these 
there is also a list of the amounts showing the total paid out 
on them by the bank. Check up the vouchers with the list, 
then check up the vouchers with your check book to see if 
all in your check book had been returned to the bank by the 
date of balancing. If there are some still out, add that, 
sum to your check book balance, and then compare the bank 
book balance with your check book. 

Deposits may be sent by mail, either with or without the 
check book. If the book is sent, it should go by registered 
mail. If you do not send the book, the bank will send a 
receipt, which you return with the book the next time the 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 341 

balance is made. In either case, write " For deposit " above 
your signature on the back.

CHAPTER XXI 
HOW TO BUY 

The first rule in good buying is to know standard quality 
in your intended purchase, for then you need not be depend- 
ent upon the salesman. The second is to know your own 
needs, that you may not be beguiled by the clever advertise- 
ment in the daily paper, or the well-displayed bargain, and 
will not need to ask the salesman's advice about quantity. 
Keep fists of articles needed in the card file, and make your 
shopping lists from these. The third rule is to apportion 
your purchases to your income and the divisions of your 
budget. 

Where to buy. — Patronize reliable firms. There are in 
any community shops of different grades, and you will not 
find the best return for your money always at those houses 
where there is the greatest parade of cut prices and bargains. 
In the end the reliable places are the cheapest. Sometimes a 
firm trades on its reputation and a degree of fashion it has 
attained, but on the whole it is true that if one house has 
goods uniformly cheaper than another, it is because the 
quality is inferior. 

One fact that a good shopper learns is this — that certain 
articles may be purchased to greater advantage at one place 
than another. One firm excels in silks, another in household 
linen, another in coffee, and so on. 

Almost every community now has a " white list " and a 
branch of the Consumers' League, the significance of which 
was explained in " Shelter and Clothing," p. 202. 

342 



HOW TO BUY 343 

How to shop. — Know the shops you patronize, first by- 
personal inspection, unless, of course, you are ordering from 
a distance. 

Mail orders and the telephone are helps to the buyer. 
These should not entirely take the place of personal visits 
to the shops, but, if well used, save many weary hours. The 
parcel post makes possible buying by mail even perishable 
articles direct from the producer. Many country dwellers 
do a large part of their shopping even for clothing and fur- 
niture by mail, and there are reputable firms who cater largely 
to this trade, and send out well-illustrated price lists as guides. 
However, this method should be used very cautiously, and 
it may be unsatisfactory for articles where the aesthetic 
element is important, as well as the quality. 

Bargains, sales, and advertisements. — Here the buyer 
matches her wit against the wiles of the seller. Bargain 
sales may be made up of sweat shop goods. Many women 
ignorant of textile production, flock to the sales of materials 
and garments, helping the storekeeper to dispose of silk 
which is rotting on his shelves, or garments which have 
been poorly or cheaply constructed and which go to pieces 
the first time laundered. Remnants are often cut from 
materials on the regular shelves, and sometimes are offered at 
an advance in price at the so-called bargain sales. In reliable 
shops one can sometimes find bargains during clearance sales. 
It pays to wait and buy out of season, as much can be saved 
in this way. A " best " hat in January, or a white dress in 
August, may often be purchased to advantage. In order to 
do this, one must plan the wardrobe systematically. 

Trading stamps and prizes. — Remember that nothing is 
given away, and that you pay for everything that you receive. 
It is well to deal with a firm that sells standard goods at 
standard prices. A discount is sometimes allowed for cash. 



344 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Buying on installments. — Methods of payment are dis- 
cussed in Chapter XX. The installment plan is important to 
consider, since it is so common for people of small means. 
How tempting for a young couple, who have no savings, to 
furnish the new home in this way? It is a " gambling on 
futures," however, as much as are some methods in the 
Stock Exchange. If the income stops, because the position 
is lost, or if sickness comes, and the installments cannot be 
paid, the whole outfit may be lost. There have been real 
household tragedies of this kind. The better way is to save 
until a small amount of simple furniture can be purchased 
outright. The installment method is also used by established 
firms of sound reputation to tempt one to buy the latest 
encyclopaedia, or the new musical instrument, or some other 
much-desired possession. This is safe if one is absolutely 
sure of a fixed future income ; but here again it is better to 
save first and buy outright. You may say that the install- 
ment plan gives the use of the encyclopaedia at once, and 
this is true. But if you have the saving habit, there will 
already be a fund on which to draw. 

The ethics of shopping. — There is no greater test of good 
breeding and kindness than the tour of a crowded shop ; 
and sometimes the silken thread is strained to the snapping 
point. Remember that tired human beings are at the counter. 

Time your shopping that you may not help to crowd busi- 
ness at the closing hour. If the shop closes at five, leave 
several minutes before the hour. As a matter of fact it is 
only to the shopper that the shop closes at the stated hour ; 
some of the hardest work of the day comes after hours. 
Avoid shopping at the luncheon hour, and on Saturday after- 
noon at the time of the week when the salespeople are most 
tired. This is also a hard time for delivery men and boys. 
Consult here the pamphlets of the Consumers' League. 



HOW TO BUY 345 

In times of stress, the shopkeeper asks you to carry small 
bundles home with you, and this you should cheerfully do. 
Some women carry the C.O.D. privilege to an extreme, or- 
dering in this way with the intention of sending certain 
articles back, thus creating much unnecessary labor. 

Purchasing of clothing and household textiles. — Experi- 
ence is a good teacher, but knowledge so gained is often paid 
for at high price. It seems an easier way, with much saving 
of time, money, and energy, for girls to learn beforehand 
what to guard against in purchasing their household textiles 
for both clothing and furnishings. Our great-grandmothers 
were sure their household textiles would wear, for they fol- 
lowed every step of their manufacture and knew they were 
durable and honest. Conditions changed with the factory 
system of manufacture, and to-day women know very little 
about textile fabrics or the making of garments. This 
ignorance of manufacturing processes results in the increased 
cost of living by the wasteful expenditures made for house- 
hold textiles. Women rely on the information given by 
clerks in stores, often to their sad disadvantage. As we have 
learned, about 15 to 20 per cent of the family income is usu- 
ally spent on clothing and household furnishings for a family 
of four. Is it not necessary then that girls should learn to 
make the dollars earned buy just as much as possible? 

There is need of a pure textile law in order that the adul- 
terations of textiles may be defined. Some of us cannot 
afford to buy pure linen or all wool, but we do wish to know 
the percentage of adulterant in order that we may judge 
whether the materials will meet our needs. It is beyond the 
power of women now to control the making of fabrics, and 
the government, therefore, must help to maintain standards 
and proper supervision of textile labeling. Women can, 
however, study this problem, and with a knowledge of the 



346 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

manufacture and composition of textiles will come the power 
to choose wisely, for manufacturers have been able to per- 
petuate these frauds chiefly because of ignorance. (See the 
companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing.") 

Some things to remember in purchasing household linens. 

1. Design is important. French designs are the most beautiful 
in damasks, Scotch and Irish are good, and German patterns per- 
haps the least attractive. Weave often affects the wearing quality 
of linen as well as the appearance. The satin stripes and long 
threads on surface are apt to wear off quickly and they are some- 
times introduced to cover defects beneath. They- cannot stand 
heavy ironing as the closer, more even, weaves. 

2. Linen is sometimes adulterated with cotton ; if bought as 
union goods one may expect it. If bought for pure linen, ravel the 
material and untwist warp and woof threads. Do the threads 
appear long and lustrous ? The round threads are best. If cotton 
has been used, the ends will fly apart and fuzz, if linen they will 
appear more parallel and pointed at the ends when separated. 
The cheaper " all linens " are sometimes made from the tow or 
short refuse. If the fiber is short, it will not last as well as the long. 
Moistening with the finger was an old-fashioned test. A better 
one is to use a drop of olive oil. This test must be made at home. 
Water spreads more rapidly on linen than on cotton. The oil 
makes the linen fibers more translucent than cotton. 

3. Cost is a guide. Linen is expensive. Is the price that 
which should insure a good article? If cheap, beware. 

4. Feel the cloth. Is it cold and does it feel rather heavy when 
crushed in the hand? Many buyers in department stores judge 
by weight. In purchasing table linen less than 4J oz. to the square 
yard is not worth buying. Above that it improves. Reliable 
firms will tell the weight. Custom house inspectors judge by the 
picks or throws of woof to the inch. 

5. Notice the finish. Is it full of starch and sizing which can 
be picked off? If so, in washing that will all disappear, leaving a 
loosely woven instead of a smooth satiny surface. Calendering 
and beetling make the material smooth and lustrous and reduce 
the thickness. Do not be deceived. It is better to buy a soft 
linen than one stiff with starch which will crack.

6. In buying table linen the goods received in December and 
January are apt to be the bleach of the previous summer. Remem- 
ber that poor bleaching affects the wearing quality. One can 
sometimes tell by tearing a sample. 

For quality, beauty, and variety of patterns, Scotch, French, and 
Irish linens are the best. German damask is excellent. The 
unbleached will wear much longer, is less expensive, and is bought 
by many housewives and bleached as used. 

Damask by the yard for tablecloths is slightly cheaper. Table- 
cloths from 1\ to 3 yards are good size for a medium family of five 
or six. One dollar a yard is a fair price for everyday linen. The 
cloth should about equal 1 dozen napkins in cost, and a cloth will 
usually wear as long as 1J to 2 dozen napkins. Napkins come in 
three sizes, f , 17-22 inches ; f , 23-27 inches ; f , 29-31 inches. 

7. For family towels, huckaback is the most serviceable, 
although damask is used a great deal (see Fig. 78). Linen 
towels vary in price from three dollars a dozen up, according to 
size and quality. Dish towels of linen crash are very serviceable. 

8. Bedding. Sheets can be purchased ready made in linen 
or cotton in various sizes. If they are to be: made at home, buy 
sheeting that can be obtained for single, two thirds, or full-sized 
bed. If cotton, buy in bleached or unbleached condition. Purchase 
sheets which are long enough to fold over at the top and protect 
the blankets. There are several good brands of cotton sheeting. 
." Fruit of the Loom " is one of the best known. 

Tubing for pillow cases may also be bought. It has no seams, 
and comes in several widths. 

9. It is better to purchase a certain amount of new linen annually 
and gradually supplement that worn than to wait and have ah 
wear out at once. 

Some things to remember in purchasing silk. 

1. That pure silk is seldom manufactured. It is nearly always 
weighted, and a large proportion of weighting is to be guarded 
against, as it weakens the wearing quality. Up to 30 per cent is 
not harmful and helps the silk to take the dye. The fact that it is 
heavy in the hand does not always mean that it is a good piece of 
material and will wear well — the weight may be due to artificial 
" weighting " and not silk. Choose rather a softer pliable silk.

2. Try the test for strength with the thumb (see " Shelter and 
Clothing," page 199) to see if the warp' and woof threads are equally 
strong, or stronger one way than the other. If the latter, it will 
not wear well. 

3. Fray out the threads. Do they break easily ? If so, the silk 
is not of good quality. If the warp threads are weak, the silk will 
split across, if the woof is weak, the silk dress will go in ribbons. 

4. If you have time before purchasing, test a sample of silk by 
burning. Place .in a porcelain dish and heat gently' for thirty 
minutes. The silk will vanish and the weighting remain. 

Burn the threads to see if there is cotton in warp or woof. Burn 
end of sample. If it is the same shape after burned, it is probably 
weighted. 

5. Close weaves wear better than more loosely woven ones and 
soft silks better than stiff. Guard against buying soft silks, how- 
ever, that are so woven as to pull in the seams when worn. 

6. Are you buying material made of reeled or spun silk? Bar- 
gains are seldom found at silk sales. Should you expect to find 
pure silk at 50 or 60 cents a yard or as many yards of silk thread 
B as A on a spool? Remember that the demand for a cheap 
product means the production of cheap products. Wear something 
else rather than cheap silks. 

7. Is the silk adulterated with mercerized cotton or artificial 
silk? Try the tests. (See " Shelter and Clothing," page 196.) 

Some things to remember in purchasing wool. 

1. Wool mixed with cotton makes a cheaper fabric and should 
not be sold for all wool. It wears well, but is not as warm as all 
wool. Garments made of it do not keep their shape as well. Wool- 
ens are often adulterated in felting. Pull the closely woven fabric 
apart and untwist the fibers to see if cotton is present. 

2. The burning test will help in deciding on the composition. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," page 198.) 

3. A good woolen or worsted fabric can always be remade. 
The inexpensive is not cheap unless you wish something which costs 
little but does not look well or wear well. One should not expect 
to get blankets of all wool for two dollars a pair. They cost five or 
six. 

4. Shoddy is one kind of recovered wool and is used to cheapen 



350 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cost of all-wool material. It can be detected because of shortness 
of the staple of wool, but when mixed is difficult to see. 

5. The weave of material affects the wearing quality. A close 
twill weave is more durable than a basket weave. 

Some things to remember about color. 

1. Blue. Dark blue in woolen material or gingham usually 
fades little. Light blue is not as durable in color. 

2. Red. Woolen material of this color wears well and usually 
fades little. Red cotton when washed looks less brilliant. It 
soon fades by washing. 

3. Black and gray. Woolen materials of gray, white, and black 
or in combination are generally satisfactory. Cotton materials of 
gray or black are apt to show starch in washing. 

4. Lavender. This is a poor color to buy. It fades easily in 
cotton goods. 

5. Pink. Fades with washing. If a deep shade be bought it 
may be satisfactory. 

6. Green. Usually very unsatisfactory. In good high priced 
ginghams it may not fade, but in cheap ones it is apt to turn yellow. 

7. Brown. Good usually in ginghams, but likely to fade in 
woolen materials. 

8. See chapters on costume design and dressmaking in " Shelter 
and Clothing," for suggestions in relation to colors one should wear. 

The above brief suggestions must be considered in the light of 
the knowledge gained from the study of the chapters on textiles 
in the companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing." 

In purchasing any materials for clothing or household 
furnishings, remember that demand causes production and 
those who are intelligent will make the right demands in the 
right places. Insist on the honest labeling of goods and 
demand that for which you pay. Why should cotton manu- 
facturers label handkerchiefs which are cotton " pure linen," 
and sell them at ten cents? We too should know linen can- 
not be bought at that price. The United States government 
employs experts to examine the standards of textiles used in 
making army, navy, and other uniforms, and will accept only 



HOW TO BUY 351 

those materials from the contracting manufacturers which 
stand their tests. If a fuller discussion of the buying of 
textile materials is desired, see Woolman and McGowan's 
" Textiles," particularly the chapters on consumer's judgment 
of textiles, on social and economic conditions, and on clothing 
budgets.

CHAPTER XXII 
HOUSEWIFERY 

This old-fashioned word is used here to include the methods 
and processes connected with the actual work of the house, 
excepting the cookery, sewing, and laundering, which have 
fuller treatment elsewhere. This department of household 
management is a combination of sanitation and the economics 
of labor. 

Order in place. — ■ Keep articles of a kind together con- 
veniently arranged in places set apart for them, these places 
to be easily accessible. Make an inventory of household 
goods in a card file, — household linen, personal apparel, 
including lists of clothing put away for summer or winter, 
dishes, and valuables. Each housekeeper must make a 
scheme that suits her own needs, but a few suggestions may 
be helpful. 

Keep bed linen and towels, piled preferably on shelves, near bed- 
rooms and bathrooms, marked and numbered. Put the clean 
underneath when they come from the laundry. 

Clothing should be kept in an orderly way by each member of 
the family. Winter clothing and furs should be cleansed for putting 
away, protected from moths by wrapping in paper, hanging in tar 
bags, putting in cedar chests, or in trunks with some strong odored 
substances, — moth balls or cedar oil. Camphor is too expensive. 
Summer clothing should be washed and put away unstarched and 
unironed. 

Dishes and silver should be carefully arranged in very definite 
places, and counted often enough to keep account of breakage and 
loss.

354 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Brooms, brushes, dusters, and cleansing materials should have a 
place of their own, well ventilated when possible, and all articles 
put away clean. 

Order in work and division of labor. — This depends so 
largely upon the number of workers, and upon the equip- 
ment of the house that no definite plan can be made for all. 
The question must be differently answered for the woman 
who has a helper one day a week, or with one or two, or with 
a large staff of workers. However, there should be some 
definite plan for the days of the week and the hours of the 
day, and some division of work among the members of the 
family or between the family and paid helpers. The young 
people of the family should each have some regular piece 
of work, at least in their own rooms ; and the paid helpers 
should have a definite plan given them, including some hours 
to themselves, as regular as possible. There are emergen- 
cies that upset even the most perfect system, and these 
must be met as they come, but a fair amount of work at 
regular times should be the system. 

" Domestic service " is too large a social and economic 
problem to discuss at length here. Miss Jane Addams calls 
it " belated industry," meaning that in domestic work we 
are far behind the productive industries of commerce in 
organization. We are trying experiments in putting work 
out, and having helpers come in, and in time we may bring 
order out of chaos when employers and employees are all 
properly trained and have the right relation to each other. 

Processes of housewifery. — Good working equipment, 
including labor-saving apparatus, is an essential ; and we 
must have knowledge of the effect of different cleansing 
materials on fabrics, wood, paint, glass, and metal. 

Equipment. — Brooms should be made of pliable straw 
(broom corn), be evenly made, with a light and comfortable 
handle. 



HOUSEWIFERY 355 

Brushes may include the whisk broom, soft brush of 
bristles both short and long handled for floors, a long handled 
brush of wool or soft material for walls, ceilings, and cornices, 
a soft brush for furniture, a thin brush for radiators, a silver 
brush, and stiff scrubbing brush. The variety of brushes at 
a furnishing shop is very large, and interesting to study. It 
is economy to buy good quality when you can, and if cleaned 
and not abused they last a long time. Wash the brushes 
in soapsuds and water, drain and dry before putting away. 
A bamboo beater is convenient. The dustpan should have a 
narrow cover at the handle side, and a strong handle. 

Carpet sweepers prevent dust from flying and are easy to 
use, but inclined to wear off the pile of the carpet. 

Vacuum cleaners are a necessity in crowded city quarters, 
where we cannot beat and shake dusty carpets and rugs out 
of windows, on the roof, or in the street, on account of our 
neighbors. That we cannot all have them does not make 
them less necessary. While they may involve no less mus- 
cular exertion they remove dust and old dirt in a remarkable 
way from fabrics, and are very useful for taking dirt from 
cracks in the floor and woodwork and from upholstered fur- 
niture. The principle of operation differs with different 
makes, and some are less effective than others, but there are 
several patterns that do good work and are not expensive. 
Experiment with one at the first opportunity. A room 
cleaned in this way is markedly different in odor from a room 
that has been swept with a broom, even when this is well done. 

A good vacuum cleaner must have an air conveying sys- 
tem, a separator or other means of disposal of the material 
picked up, and a vacuum producer. They may be divided, 
according to the method employed, into those worked by 
bellows, by fan, by rotary pump and piston pump. This is 
a problem to take to the class in physics. 



356 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cleaning cloths. — Have a good supply of cheesecloth 
dusters, and heavier cloth for work on the floors. A sponge 
and chamois are useful. The mop, which is a cloth or fiber 
fabric on a handle, is something that we ought to banish 
when we can, for it is hard to keep clean, and is a trap for 
bacteria. A substitute for the common mop is a long handle 
with a cross bar covered with corrugated rubber, which is 
held down on the cloth, and rubbed back and forth but not 
fastened to the cloth. Avoid the use of linty old cloths, 
because the thread and lint clog the traps and drains. 

Cleaning cloths should be boiled in strong soap suds, 
rinsed, and thoroughly dried before putting away. This is 
a difficult rule to enforce, for it is a temptation to tuck 
such things away where they will not show. Watch this 
matter as you do the garbage pail. When a cloth is too 
dirty to wash clean, burn it or send it away with paper 
refuse. 

Cleaning materials. — Air, sunshine, and water are the 
great purifiers, plus muscular energy or the power of ma- 
chinery, but we frequently use chemical aids. These should 
all be kept in stock. 

Soaps and alkalies. — White and yellow soap, some washing 
powder, sal soda, caustic soda, household ammonia. Buy these in 
quantities if you have room to store them, and if they will not be 
used too lavishly because the supply is large. The soap is not much 
cheaper by the box, but it hardens with age, and then it wastes 
less rapidly when used. 

Oils and polishes. — Crude oil, kerosene, a mixture of linseed 
oil, vinegar, and turpentine, one part each, cottonseed oil, alcohol. 

Acids. — A solution of oxalic acid marked poison. Vinegar is 
on hand among kitchen supplies. 

Gritty substances. — Rotten stone, whiting, some gritty soap of a 
kind that does not scratch, a gritty powder, or fine sand for coarse 
work. 

Disinfectant and deodorizers. — A weak solution of carbolic acid 



HOUSEWIFERY 357 

marked poison, chloride of lime, or some reliable preparation 1 
(though, these are rather expensive), rock salt, and coarse common 
salt. 

Methods of cleaning. — We must first consider what the 
substance is that has to be removed. The fabrics and up- 
holstery used in furnishing catch dust which contains lint, 
grit, organic material from our bodies, and bacteria. Fab- 
rics also become spotted (see next chapter). The walls 
and ceilings, floors and cracks, catch dust. All wood and 
glass surfaces become soiled from the touch of even clean 
fingers, and the moisture of the air mixed with dust dulls 
them. Metal surfaces oxidize, and this oxidized layer must 
be rubbed off. 

To clean fabrics. — If you live in a suburb or in the country, 
brush, shake, and beat articles to be cleaned out of doors, noticing 
the way of the wind that the dust may not be carried back into the 
house. 

To cleanse a rug, spread it on the grass, rub with a medium 
stiff brush with white soap solution on the wrong side, turn it over, 
and rinse with water from the hose ; or better still, tack it by two 
corners to a wooden wall, and then wash with hose. The city 
dweller must resort to the vacuum cleaner, or rely upon a cleaning 
establishment. The other alternative is to shake out the dust in 
the room, remove each article as it is cleaned, let the dust settle, 
and take it out as well as it can be. One apartment dweller heard 
this remark rise from the window below her: " Shut the window 
quick. Those dirty people upstairs are brushing a rug out the 
window ! " 

Painted surfaces and woodwork should be wiped off with a soft 
cloth wrung out of tepid water. A small amount of neutral white 
soap solution in the water can be used for paint if it is greasy, but 
alkalies are ruinous. 

A highly polished surface (piano) is cleaned by washing with 

1 Some of the widely advertised disinfectants are rather ineffective. 
Those interested should look up the tests of commercial disinfectants pub- 
lished from time to time by the United States Public Health Service. 



358 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a sponge and tepid water, and rubbing until dry with a wet chamois 
wrung out of cold water. This method was learned from a piano 
polisher, and it works excellently. A dry chamois streaks the 
surface. 

The wood of furniture is kept clean by rubbing with a soft dry 
cloth, but once in a while needs cleaning with crude oil or the mix- 
ture of oil, turpentine, and vinegar. Bureau drawers need watch- 
ing for finger marks. 

Glass is best cleaned by rubbing on a mixture of whiting and 
water. Leave it to dry and rub off with a dry cloth. A fine gritty 
soap comes for this purpose. Ammonia and water and a soft 
cloth work well, the success depending upon the final polishing. 
Very soft tissue paper is satisfactory for polishing. 

Marble, porcelain, and enamel need little more than white soap 
suds, rinsed off and the surface dried. If spotted, use the finest 
kind of metal soap. 

Metals. — Fine silver and plated ware should be kept polished 
by the daily careful washing, rinsing in hot water. Silver will 
spot and tarnish. Use whiting and alcohol, let it dry on, and rub 
off with a clean cloth or chamois. 

The silver powders sold at the silversmith's are very good, but 
the patent powders and liquids should not be used, as they remove 
too much of the silver. 

Brass and copper are polished with rotten stone and oil. If 
the metal is spotted, use oxalic acid solution with the rotten stone. 
After rubbing well, the metal should be washed off in hot soap suds 
and finished with a dry cloth. 

Nickel plate keeps bright if kept clean by daily dry rubbing. 

Care of rooms. — The bedroom. — The daily care includes 
airing the room and its closets, airing and making the bed, 
dusting, removing lint and threads from the floor, and re- 
moving slops and bringing fresh water if bathing apparatus 
is in the room. 

To make the bed. — The amount of airing of the bedclothes 
depends somewhat upon the weather ; bed linen absorbs too much 
damp if placed by the window on a rainy or foggy day. Pull back 
the bedclothes and hang them over a chair set front to the foot of 



HOUSEWIFERY 359 

the bed, seeing that the bedclothes do not drag on the floor. On a 
bright, fresh day remove all the clothes and hang them singly near 
the window. If there is a screen in the room, this is convenient for 
this purpose. The blankets should be hung out on the line once in 
a while, and washed twice a year. One important point in the 
cleanliness of the bed is a pad or thiek cloth placed on the mat- 
tress under the sheet. The mattress should be sunned and aired 
often, and beaten or cleaned with the vacuum cleaner. 

To make the bed, place the cover on the mattress, lay the under 
sheet straight, tuck in firmly at top and bottom, and fold the sides 
under straight, making angles at the corners. Put each piece on 
separately, turning the upper sheet down over the others. The 
cover is sometimes placed over all, and a strip to match over the 
pillows. 

Care of the washstand. — This is all important, and cannot be 
neglected a day, without causing an unpleasant odor. The jars 
containing slops should be rinsed in cold water, washed out in warm 
soap suds, dried, and aired. If the ware is china, hot water may 
crackle the glaze, and then it is impossible to remove odors. Wash 
and dry all the small articles and wipe out and refill the water 
pitcher. 

Care of the bedroom at night. — Fold back, or remove the covers, 
and lay the bedclothes partly back. See that drinking water 
is in the room, and lighting conveniences. 

The living room, dining room, and halls. — The daily 
care consists in setting furniture and such small articles as 
the pictures and ornaments straight, removing lint and dust 
from the floor, dusting wherever needed. 

The weekly cleaning of all rooms. — Whether a thorough 
cleaning is needed weekly, depends upon the situation of the 
house, and the number of people jvho use the rooms. The 
rooms in a country house set in wide green spaces do not need 
cleaning so often as those of a city house. 

General order for all rooms. — Dust all small articles, place 
them together and cover them. Dust and clean off furniture and 
take the lighter pieces from the room. Cover what remains. Clean 



360 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the textile fabrics in the best way available. Brush the walls, 
with a special brush, or soft cloth on a broom. Dust and cover 
pictures. Brush the rugs, or use vacuum cleaner. If the floor is 
hardwood, brush it with a soft brush, taking long, steady strokes 
from corner and sides to center. Take up dust in pan, and carry 
away to burn, or put in dust can at once. Wipe the floor with moist 
cloth, or with oiled cloth. 

If there is a carpet and a broom is to be used, scatter pieces of 
wet paper over it, moisten the broom, and sweep as directed for 
brushing, using steady strokes and not allowing the dust to fly. 
The broom should be washed and dried. If dust flies, allow it 
time to settle. Dust the surfaces left exposed. Wipe off the wood- 
work if necessary, <remove covers, and replace all articles. To have 
the room perfectly clean, windows should be washed, but if this is 
not convenient at the time, or the weather is bad, rub them and 
dust the sashes. Wash mirrors and the glass of pictures. This 
means much labor, and some people cannot accomplish it every 
week ; and different rooms should have different cleaning days. But 
such thorough cleaning occasionally is necessary for keeping all 
articles in good condition and also for the health of the family. 

The old-fashioned yearly house cleaning seems hardly necessary 
if cleaning is well done through the year, but in both fall and spring 
some' extra freshening may be necessary in the way of thorough 
cleansing of textiles and furniture. All closets should have every- 
thing removed from them and the whole closet cleansed. Drawers 
should come out, be emptied, washed and aired, and fresh white 
or brown paper put in all. 

The bathroom and toilet. — This needs very particular 
care, no matter what the type may be. All drains and traps 
should be flushed daily, and a solution of caustic soda put 
down weekly. If there is an odor about the water closet, 
try salt first, and then some chloride preparation. The basin, 
# the tub, and the seat and basin of the toilet should be thor- 
oughly washed daily. When the bathroom is used by more 
than one person, all should be taught to leave all the toilet 
equipment perfectly clean. If the toilet is not of the water- 
closet type, even greater care should be taken. Everything 



HOUSEWIFERY 361 

must be kept scrubbed clean, and chloride of lime should 
be put down daily, if there is not a removable pail with earth. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," p. 48.) 

Care of lamps. — If. kerosene is used, this is an important 
feature of housework. 

Have a tray for holding necessary articles, soft cloth, paper, 
strong, sharp scissors, lamp chimney brush. When the lamp is to 
be cleaned, set it upon this tray. Take off all the easily removable 
parts. Fill the lamp through a funnel, and do not let the kerosene 
run over. Wipe off the charred wick with paper, and wipe the 
burner. Wash off the lamp in warm soap suds, wash and polish 
the chimney and shade, and replace. If you cannot get rid of odor, 
take the burner apart, boil it in a solution of washing soda, and put 
in a new wick. Cleaning a lamp is not nearly so disagreeable as 
many people think it, when it is done with good will. To shirk it 
means an unpleasant odor in the room and a poor light. Always 
fill the lamp in the daytime and keep it away from the fire. 

Household insects. — Keep out flies and mosquitoes by 
screens, but see first that your premises are clean, and do 
what you can in the whole neighborhood. 

Flies breed in dirty stables and mosquitoes in standing water. 
The stables must be cleaned and kept so, and water drained off or 
kerosene put upon it. Mosquitoes will breed in water in an empty 
milk bottle or old tomato can. If flies enter the house, kill them in 
some way. Wire or net fly killers cost only ten cents, and do 
good work. If the flies are very numerous, catch them in wire traps, 
or burn pyrethrum powder in the room. At night when they are 
on the ceiling, catch them in a glass of hot water and soap, not 
quite full, by holding the glass under the fly and gently knocking 
the glass against the ceiling. If the ceiling is high, tack an empty 
can on the end of an old broom stick and set the glass in that. 

Clothing moths are kept out by precautions already mentioned. 

If bed bugs appear, go over the bed with great care and examine 
the bedstead. Wash it off with kerosene, putting this well into 
the cracks. A single insect may be brought in on the clothing. If 
they continue to appear, all wall paper should be removed, wood- 



362 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

work varnished or painted. It may be necessary to resort to fumi- 
gation, but this should be done by an expert. Croton or water 
bugs are difficult to destroy, if they are once in a house. No gar- 
bage should be left about, to attract them at night. There are 
powders that drive them away, and another remedy is sulphur 
paste, which comes for the purpose, and which may be spread on 
shoes of potato. The U. S. Department of Agriculture issues free 
bulletins on the suppression of household insects. 

Precautions against fire. — So many disastrous fires occur 
as a result of a careless act that we need to train ourselves 
in caution. The matches used should be of the safety type. 
They should be blown out, never shaken, and never thrown 
into a basket of papers. When matches are used, always 
have a small fire-proof receptacle in each room. Smokers 
are often careless in regard to their matches, cigars, and pipes. 
Be careful in summer to see that a breeze cannot blow some 
light curtain over a candle or lamp. 

If a kettle of fat catches fire, pour on sand, but never water. 
As a general rule, extinguish a flame by covering it rather than by 
throwing on water. 

If clothing catches on fire, wrap a rug or any large woolen article 
tightly around the body. To rush into the air is fatal. 

If a towel or apron catches fire, roll it up quickly before the blaze 
spreads. This can be done without injury to the hands. 

Small fire extinguishers are not expensive. Most kinds contain 
a solution of soda and a bottle of sulphuric acid which mix when the 
extinguisher is inverted, and throw out a stream of water charged 
with gas from a small hose. This works well just as a fire starts. Ex- 
tinguishers arranged to throw a stream of carbon tetrachloride are 
also on the market. 

Repairs. — Too often in planning the budget, and the 
daily work, the housekeeper forgets to allow for the constant 
wear and tear on the house itself, and its furnishings; but 
to preserve the beauty and usefulness of both the house and 
furniture, as much thought and time are necessary as for the 



HOUSEWIFERY 363 

repair of clothing. In addition to the care and cleaning, 
there must be a constant attention to small repairs. 

Inspecting and reporting. — Have a series of cards in the card 
file, or pages in the notebook, where needed repairs may be jotted 
down. Have a regular time for looking over different parts of the 
house ; and give a brief daily look as you pass from room to room. 
Each member of the family, should be asked to report whatever goes 
wrong in his province, — a leaky faucet, a squeaky door, or broken 
castor, a tear in a curtain, a shade roller that does not work. 

For large repairs, like a leak in the water or waste system or 
shingle on a roof, a trained worker is needed ; but for small repairs 
a special worker from outside is too expensive, and there needs to 
be a handy person in the house, who can put in a screw, and use a 
monkey wrench, touch up the paint or varnish, or mend the wall 
paper. It is pleasant work, and in these days when schools teach so 
much handicraft, there should be some one in the family glad to 
do it. 

A repair outfit. — Have a shelf somewhere for the repair "kit." 
Look at the woodwork of your house, and see what is needed ; 
whether paint, or varnish, an oil mixture or stain, or all of them. 
Have on hand a small can of each, and bottles of alcohol, turpentine, 
and glue. Two or three paint brushes of good quality and of dif- 
ferent sizes are needed. Keep a bundle of wall paper including 
pieces of all the patterns on the walls. A box of tools is needed, 
including a hammer, gimlet, screw driver, monkey wrench, a sharp 
knife, with boxes of nails and screws of mixed kinds and sizes such 
as may be found at any hardware store.

CHAPTER XXIII 

LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 

" Washing is a necessity, ironing a luxury." This terse 
sentence expresses very clearly the relative value of the two 
large divisions of the laundering process. The thorough 
washing of clothing is a most important branch of household 
sanitation, upon which the health of the family and of the 
whole community depends, for disease is communicable by 
means of soiled garments and those that are imperfectly 
cleansed in unsanitary houses and possibly in commercial 
laundries. The ideal city will have many large and spot- 
lessly clean laundries, where skilled labor intelligently di- 
rected will insure clothing as clean as it can possibly be made. 

There is an aesthetic element in laundering as well, for good 
washing methods give a tinted white to fabrics that it is a 
pleasure to see, and ironing makes a smoothness that is 
pleasant to the touch, and brings out beauty of design, as 
in damasks and embroideries. There is an economic feature, 
too, in that poor and rough methods of work in both washing 
and ironing injure fabrics and shorten their term of usable- 
ness. 

" Washing Day " has an ill repute that it does not deserve, 
for laundering is a science and an art. that it is a pleasure to 
practice, if one has skill. Make it one of the household arts 
which you must carefully study, and you will find it pleasur- 
able as well as necessary. 

Soil in garments. — The dust and dirt of the street and 
house that soil our garments contain inorganic particles of 

365 



366 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

earth, lint from textiles, organic matter from animals and 
human beings, and also bacteria. The material from our 
bodies consists of particles of skin, skin secretions, and bac- 
teria, which are collected in underwear and bed linen and 
towels. Spots of grease and stains may fall upon our outer 
clothing, and fruit stains affect table linen in particular. 

Cleansing agents. — Water is the great cleanser, and if 
it is not available in abundance and used freely, the washing 
is a failure. All other agents are merely aids to the water 
or substitutes for it. In primitive outdoor methods, still 
largely used in some countries, the flowing water is the only 
agent, and yet the result is fairly good. We aid the process 
by the use of soap or washing powders or ammonia. 

The air and sun are also purifiers, and clothing should be 
exposed to their action for drying whenever possible. There 
is a sweetness in air and sun-dried clothing that no artificial 
drier seems to give. Probably there takes place some oxi- 
dation of impurities present in very small amount and, more- 
over, any bacteria still clinging to the fabric may be killed 
by the sun's rays. Heat is a purifier, oily substances being 
more readily removed by hot water and soap than by cold ; 
and the boiling temperature of water renders bacteria and 
organic matter harmless. 

Some mechanical action that forces water through the 
fabric is necessary, and the method of accomplishing this is 
one of the important problems in laundering. We seek a 
method that will be thorough, that will not injure the fabric, 
and that will economize the muscular energy of the worker. 
Beating, pounding, and rubbing are the old methods, the 
use of a machine the new, and that is the best machine that 
meets all the requirements of the properly conducted washing 
process as described below. 

The water should be soft and clean. Rain water is a per- 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 367 

fectly soft water and excellent for laundering if the cistern 
is kept clean, and free from the dust of the roof. Lake, 
river, and well water are sometimes soft. Strainers may be 
used on the faucets if at any time the water from these 
sources becomes muddy. (See Chapter V for discussion of 
soft and hard water.) 

Hard water prevents the soap from lathering, and this 
must be counteracted for laundering. Temporary hardness 
is removed by boiling. Permanent hardness is not affected 
by boiling and can be overcome only by the addition of some 
substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. Only enough of 
these should be used to allow the soap to do its work, since 
they may injure fabric and the skin of the worker. 

Soap is the most useful of the cleansing agents added to 
water. It may have been accidentally made in the first 
place by some housewife who put a greasy pot to soak with 
a solution of lye made from the ashes of her hearth fire. Heat 
and alkali break up the fat into two parts, glycerin and a fatty 
acid. The fatty acid combines with the alkali, giving soap, 
and the glycerin remains free. Both animal and vegetable 
fats are used, and different forms of alkali, usually potash or 
caustic soda, the former for soft, the latter for hard, soap. 

In these days soap is much better made in the factory than 
it can be at home. In the factory the alkali is proportioned 
by weight, so that as little free alkali is left as possible. 
Such a soap is called " neutral." Resin is added, in yellow 
laundry soaps, and is supposed to aid in forming suds. When 
there is an excess of resin, as in some cheap soaps, it is hard 
to rinse out and colors the clothes. Borax is sometimes 
added to soap, and is useful when the water is hard, but not 
necessary in soft water. Naphtha or some other petroleum 
oil in soap increases the cleansing property of soap, by dis- 
solving fatty or greasy impurities. 



368 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A soap solution is essential for use in the boiler and in 
washing machines and is useful for rubbing on spots before 
washing. 

To make soap solution, cut up the soap and dissolve it in hot 
water, one pound soap to one gallon of water. It should be strong 
enough to jelly when cool, and may be kept in jars ready to use. 
Even more convenient are soap chips which come by the barrel, but 
may be bought at pound rates. 

Bleaching and bluing agents. — The sun, as it bleaches 
white fabrics, may be counted in this group. Chemical 
bleaches are used to whiten clothes, but should not be re- 
sorted to unless clothes are yellow from poor washing, as in 
the end they weaken the fabric. Commercial laundries 
sometimes use an excess of acid for this purpose. Cream of 
tartar is a harmless bleach. Javelle water is another house- 
hold bleach, chloride of lime being the bleaching substance. 
This is also a good disinfectant. 

To use cream of tartar. — Dissolve cream of tartar in hot water, 

1 teaspoonful to each quart. After the yellowed fabrics have been 
thoroughly washed and rinsed, lay them overnight in a solution 
of this strength, rinse, blue, and dry in the morning. 

Javelle water. — \ pound chloride of lime, 1 pound sal soda, 

2 quarts of cold water. Dissolve the chloride in half the water 
cold, and the sal soda in the other half boiling. Stir together 
thoroughly, allow the mixture to stand several hours, pour off the 
clear water with care, and bottle it. Use a tablespoonful of the 
solution to a gallon of water, and heat the yellow fabric in this 
mixture after thorough washing, for half an hour, not allowing the 
temperature to rise above 100° P. Rinse very thoroughly before 
bluing and drying. 

Bluing is used to neutralize the slightly yellowish tint of 
the fabric, when it cannot be completely bleached. 

Ultramarine blue is sold in small balls and cakes. 

Aniline blue is a strong color, and in a very dilute solution gives 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 369 

a pleasing pearly tint to the fabric, especially when the violet tint 
is used. Mix an ounce of the blue with one gallon water, and bottle 
for use. 

Prussian blue is to be avoided, since it is a salt of iron, and often 
yellows or spots the clothes. It is usually sold in liquid form. To 
test, mix the liquid blue with a strong solution of washing soda and 
heat. If the mixture turns red, and there is a reddish precipitate, 
the blue is this salt of iron. 

Starch is used to fill the interstices of fabrics and give a 
smoothness and stiffness to the cloth that prevents the 
rumpling of garments. Both wheat and cornstarch are used 
for laundry purposes when only the natural starches are 
available, the wheat starch being better for home laundering, 
as the cornstarch gives a quality that is too stiff and crack- 
ling. Recently, however, the manufacturers have learned 
to make " thin boiling " starches from corn and have placed 
on the market a variety of such modifications of cornstarch 
for laundry use. Rice starch or " rice water " is used for 
very thin muslins. 

To make starch. — For method of making, see starch experiments, 
Chapter VIII. The starch must be perfectly smooth, and should be 
stirred while it is boiling for a few minutes, and strained. 
Proportions. 

1. For lingerie, 1 teaspoonful of starch to 1 quart water. 

2. For medium fabrics, \\ to 3 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart 
water. 

3. For stiff work, 5 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart water. 

Ironing. — The ironing process is the most difficult art 
in laundering, and requires good tools, practice, and patience. 
In the summer it is an exhausting labor unless an electric 
or gas iron is available. Much energy may be saved in hot 
weather by omitting the ironing of certain articles. Dish 
'towels, even toilet towels, and soft underwear may be 
stretched and folded, and are perfectly comfortable to use. 
2b 



370 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Some women who do their own work even fold sheets and 
pillow cases without ironing. 

The smoothing of the fabric is accomplished by heated 
irons, or by pressing between rollers in a mangle. 

To summarize. — The essential steps in laundering are : 
the forcing of clear water through the fabric ; loosening of 
the soil and stains by soap and appropriate chemicals, sterili- 
zation by boiling temperature, drying and sweetening in the 
air if possible. The less essential are bluing, starching, and 
in some cases ironing. 

Laundry equipment. — We are beginning to realize that a 
separate room for laundering purposes is an essential in a 
well-equipped home. Such a laundry will be light and well 
ventilated, will have washable floors, walls, and ceilings, 
running water and hot water supply, sanitary tubs and con- 
veniences in the shape of machinery. We shall not have 
perfect laundries until electric power is available at a fair 
price. Much is said about electricity on the farm, and the 
progressive farmer who has his own engine should not fail 
to use the power for all laundry work. Trolley power should 
be available, and this use of electricity should be made co- 
operative when practicable. In a few communities abroad 
and at home, the power available in a creamery is used for 
laundering purposes as well. 

Where there cannot be a separate laundry, take pains to 
have the equipment as good as space will allow. 

The tubs. — If possible, have three tubs, for this makes for econ- 
omy of time. Enameled tubs are the most sanitary, and be sure 
that they are white. You cannot tell whether or not the clothes 
are clean and blued to the proper tint in a buff-tinted tub, which 
you may be tempted to buy because it is cheaper. 

Round portable tubs, to be set upon a bench, should be of gal- 
vanized iron, which is sanitary and light. Wooden tubs are things 
of the past, unsanitary and heavy. 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 371 

. Equipment for forcing water. — The rubbing board is the old-time 
method, yet it wears the fabric and wears out the worker, and 
should be used as little as possible. If still considered necessary, 
it should be of glass set in wood. The wooden board is unsanitary 
and the metal board may at any moment develop a tiny crack that 
will tear the fabric. 

Fortunately, many women are learning that the washing machine, 
properly used, is a great economy of fabric, time, and strength. 
Many machines are on the market, and we need to discriminate 
and to select the machine constructed to force the water through 
the fabric without injury to the fabric, and with the smallest 
amount of muscular energy and that properly exerted without 
strain. Of course, if machine power is available, the problem is 
easy. These many washers may be classed in four groups. One 
is a revolving arrangement, sometimes consisting of two corrugated 
boards set in the center of a tub of clothes, one objection being that 
the clothes are sometimes torn. Another type has a revolving 
perforated inner cylinder for the clothes, and an outer one for the 
soap and water. This is much more expensive. Still a third rocks 
the clothes in soap and water and is very effective. A fourth type 
makes use of suction. 

The principle of cleansing by pressure and suction is used in 
several machines and hand washers, and these are, on the whole, 
inexpensive and practical for home work. The work is accomplished 
by an inverted cone, pushed down on the clothes, and lifted. Such 
a washer is seen standing on the floor in Fig. 80. The same figure 
also shows another of this type standing on the table, and still 
another to be used in the boiler. 

Most of these devices can be used with power. 

The boiler. — A portable boiler is convenient. It should be 
made of good quality tin with copper bottom and must be thoroughly 
washed and dried after using. 

The wringer is of great assistance to good work. It should be a 
good machine having hard rubber rollers, ball-bearing action, and 
strong springs at the side. It must be cleaned after using, dried, 
the pressure loosened, and the whole kept covered. 

The drier. — If clothesline or heavy wire is used, this must be of 
good quality, and well cared for. The clothesline should be taken 
in- after each using. A revolving drier is convenient, and may even 



372 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 




LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING ■ 373 

be used in apartment houses. The steam drier has a rack on which 
clothes are hung, and economizes space and time. 

Irons. — The hand iron is heated in several different ways. 
The old-fashioned iron heated on the stove, and the electric iron are 
the most satisfactory. In buying hand irons, select those of good 
weight, for this makes the work easier. Three or four will suffice 
for ordinary work, and they should weigh from 4 or 5 to 7 pounds. 
A small pointed iron is necessary for fine work, and for sleeves there 
is a special, narrow iron. The irons must be kept clean, and per- 
fectly dry when not in use. Wax tied in a cloth is a good cleaner, 
and should be at hand during the ironing process. A stand is nec- 
essary on which the iron may rest, and paper or cloth on which 
to rub the iron when it comes from the stove. 

Electric irons are proving very satisfactory, and although the 
first cost is high, they should be used wherever possible. 

The mangle. — Small mangles, used either cold or heated, are 
now made for family use, and are great labor savers in flat work. 
Towels and small flat pieces may even be put through the wringer, 
while they are still damp, with very good effect. 

The ironing board. — This should be firm, well padded, and 
covered with clean cloth. The cover may be made to tie on so 
that it can be easily changed. Ironing boards should be placed 
in a good light. Boards may be attached to the wall, and these 
have firm support. In a small room, the board can be made to 
turn up. 

Other apparatus. — A hamper or bag for soiled clothes, a basket 
for clean, pail and dipper, a clothes stick, a large pan, a small and a 
large saucepan, a teakettle for boiling water, a knife, wooden spoon, 
common spoons and measures, a sprinkler or brush for sprinkling 
clothes, a clotheshorse, clothes hangers for waists and dresses. 
The soiled clothes bag should be washed weekly, and the hamper 
should have a removable lining also for weekly washing. 

Monday and Tuesday are the traditional days for washing 
and ironing, but the woman who does her own work, or per- 
haps has a helper, or one maid, may find it a good plan to do 
no more on Monday than the mending, removing of stains, 
and sorting. This gives time to make the house orderly, 
after Sunday, and to prepare food, some of which may last 



374 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over the next two days. Some of the clothes may then be 
soaked overnight. 

Order of work. — Mending, sorting the clothes, removing 
stains, soaking, washing, boiling, rinsing, bluing, starching, 
drying, sprinkling and rolling, ironing, folding, airing, 
sorting, and distributing. 

Methods. — Mending and removing spots from fabrics 
are discussed in " Shelter and Clothing." A few common 
stains are removed as follows : 

Fruit and coffee stains. — Hold the spotted fabric tightly over a 
bowl and pour boiling water through it. Of course, remove stains 
at once if possible. 

Peach stains are removed by Javelle water. Apply a few drops 
and pour boiling water through at once. 

Cocoa and chocolate stains are helped by borax, and by soap and 
cold water. 

Ink. — Liquid ink removers provided for the library table are 
convenient. Wet the spot, use 1, dry with a blotter, and use 2, 
and rinse at once. The same thing is done by wetting, applying 
an oxalic acid solution first, then Javelle water and rinsing. 

Blood stains are removed by soaking in lukewarm water, and 
washing in a soap solution with a little ammonia and kerosene, or 
with a naphtha soap. 

Sorting. — Separate the fabrics, wool from cotton and so on, 
and colored cotton from white ; also separate body linen from bed 
linen and from table linen. 

Soaking. — This hastens the process since it loosens dirt, and 
one laboratory experiment seemed to show that soaked clothes are 
freer from bacteria, than those that are not. 

Shrinkable fabrics cannot be soaked. Body and table linen 
should be soaked separately. The water should be cold, softened 
with a little ammonia. 

Washing. — Wash woolens and silk underwear first, in warm, 
not hot, soap suds, wring out, rinse, and hang to dry. Use a white, 
neutral soap. Have the same temperature for both washing and 
rinsing. Boiling water shrinks wool, and yellows silk. Hand- 
knit wool, as shawls and jackets, stretch in drying. If dried in a 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 375 

bag or pillow case, this is partly obviated, or lay them on a pad on 
the table. 

Prepare hot water in the tub, with dissolved soap in it, either for 
handwork or a washer. Wash table linen first, then bed linen and 
towels, and next the body clothes. Soap the articles well, and 
rub or use a washer. It is well to wash handkerchiefs by them- 
selves, boiling in a pail for half an hour. If one of the family has a 
cold or influenza, soak his handkerchiefs in a solution of salt and 
water and perhaps a little bleaching powder before washing and 
boiling. 

Make fresh suds often. This means heavy labor in the case 
of portable tubs, but clothes cannot be cleansed in dirty water. 

Colored cotton and linen articles may be washed last. They 
should be put first into salt and water to set the color, washed in 
tepid water with white soap, rinsed thoroughly and hung in the 
shade, wrong side out. 

Boiling. — Boil the washed clothes in soap solution for ten min- 
utes. In case of infectious disease, all the patient's linen should 
be boiled an hour, 1 and of course exposed clothing is kept separate 
through the whole process. 

Rinsing. — This must be thorough and two or three waters must 
be used. This is the stage where many laundresses fail. The 
suction washers are very useful here. 

Wringing. — This must take place between every two stages of 
the process. 

Bluing. — Add the bluing solution to clean water to the desired 
shade, shake each piece, put it through the water, and wring out 
at once. Do not use bluing in excess. 

Starching. — Next the fabrics that need a little thin starch may 
be starched. Starch for stiff collars and shirts is rubbed in at the 
time of ironing. 

Drying. — Hang out the clothes, having pieces of a kind to- 
gether, and the threads straight. If out of doors, hang in such a 
way that the air will have easy access. 

Take down, when dry, and fold lightly in a basket. 

Sprinkle, roll tightly, and leave them until ironing time. Thin 
fabrics should be very moist, as they dry quickly. 

1 Depenumg upon the nature of the infection, it may be possible to sub- 
stitute the use of a proper disinfectant, followed by short boiling. 



376 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Ironing. — This art must be acquired by watching the expert 
and by practice. 

Shake or stretch the article, and lay it straight upon the board. 
Iron from right to left, arranging the material with the left hand,

and iron with the long thread of the material. Bring the article 
on the board toward you. Iron first the parts that will wrinkle least, 
such as ruffles and trimming and sleeves. Embroidery and damask 
should be ironed on a very soft material like a Turkish towel, right 
side down. Always iron until the fabric is dry. 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 



377 




All tucks and folds must be carefully straightened, and if ironed 
crooked, they must be made very wet and done over again. When 
ironing a waist will you do the sleeve or the body first ? 

Large flat pieces, 
towels, and napkins 
are folded in the iron- 
ing. Doilies and 
centerpieces should 
not be folded. 

Folding is neces- 
sary in order to make 
the garments of con- 
venient shape for put- 
ting away. Figures 
81 and 82 will suggest 
the method for some 
garments. 

Commercial laun- 
dries. — The con- 
venience of these 
has been suggested 
already. When we 
can make them all 
sanitary, and when 
methods are used 
that will not injure 
the fabric, we can 
safely put this kind 
of work out of the 
house, but at present many commercial laundries are unsan- 
itary and ruin the clothes. 

Cost of laundering. — We cannot have good service with- 
out paying for it, and one cause of poor laundry work is the 
public demand for cheap work, and this too has its effect 
upon the laundry worker. The housekeeper often fails to

378 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

have the laundry ready when the wagon calls, and yet de- 
mands a quick return, which also results in poor work. 

If you have never done any laundering and expect a laun- 
dress to do up fine lingerie at a low rate, it will be a revelation 
to you to attempt to iron a shirt waist or lingerie dress, and 
then decide what remuneration you would yourself like to 
receive. One class of high school girls, after a course of six 
laundry lessons, decided that a dollar a dozen was fair pay 
for ordinary work ! This is an interesting question for class 
and home discussion. 

Dry cleaning. — This is accomplished by gasoline, 
naphtha, or benzine, and should not be attempted by the 
city dweller. In the country or suburbs, it should be done 
out of doors, far from any source of fire. Use a basin or tub, 
and immerse the article in the liquid, using as much as if 
water, lifting gently up and down. Rinse in a second por- 
tion. A suction washer may be used with large garments. 
Do not rub the fabric in the liquid. Lift, drain, and hang to 
dry. Keep the can in a safe place, safety being insured by 
coolness. 

Powdered French chalk may be rubbed into delicate silk 
and wool, where there is a grease spot, or an oiliness from 
the skin. Leave for twenty-four hours, then shake, and 
brush out. 

Ether and chalk may be used, but the ether affects some 
people unpleasantly, and dissolves out some delicate colors. 
Meal may also be used for cleaning wool, especially knitted 
fabrics, but it is difficult to shake out, and it needs blowing 
out on the clothesline. 



Laboratory management. — A few lessons can be given in laundering where 
there is no complete equipment. Dish towels, doilies, and napkins can at 
least be washed in dishpans in the school kitchen, and a few irons provided. 
A few such lessons are helpful at least in developing an appreciation of what 
good laundering means at home and to the community.

cient laundry equipment. 

13. Obtain a laundry list from a commercial laundry. Make 
a list of the articles washed at home, and compare cost with the 
cost of putting out clothes, estimating fuel, cleansers, labor, and 
some wear and tear of apparatus. 



APPENDIX 

CLASSIFICATION OF FOODSTUFFS 

Elements required by the body 

Carbon Phosphorus Sodium 

Hydrogen Iron Chlorine 

Oxygen Calcium Iodine (traces) 

Nitrogen Magnesium Fluorine (traces) 

Sulphur Potassium Silicon (traces) 

Foodstuffs furnishing these elements 

Proteins — furnish carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, 

and sometimes phosphorus and iron 
Fats — • furnish carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
Carbohydrates — furnish carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen 
Mineral matter — furnishes phosphorus, iron, calcium, magnesium, 

sodium, potassium, chlorine, iodine, fluorine 
Water — furnishes hydrogen and oxygen 

General functions of these foodstuffs 

To supply energy 

To supply building material 

To regulate body processes 

Special functions of each foodstuff 

Proteins — supply energy ; also nitrogen, sulphur, and sometimes 

phosphorus for body building 
Fats — supply energy in the most concentrated form 
Carbohydrates — supply energy in the most economical form 
Mineral matter — supplies building material and helps to regulate 

body processes 
Water — supplies necessary material (about 60 per cent of body 

being water) and helps to regulate body processes

Digestion of trie foodstuffs 

Having seen what each of the foodstuffs does in nourishing the 
body, we may now see how they are prepared for the use of the body 
in the digestive tract. 

Digestion of carbohydrate. — The simplest carbohydrate is a 
sugar which cannot be broken up into other sugars. Such a simple 
sugar is called a monosaccharid. There are two common in foods, 
glucose and fructose ; a third, galactose, is derived from more com- 
plex sugars. Two simple sugars united chemically make a double 
sugar or disaccharid ; thus cane sugar or sucrose will yield glucose 
and fructose, while milk sugar or lactose will yield glucose and 
galactose, and maltose will yield two portions of glucose. These 
three disaccharids are the only common ones. Starches^ dextrins, 
and cellulose or vegetable fiber are made of many simple glucose 



APPENDIX 385 

groups, and are hence called polysaecharids. All carbohydrates 
to be used by the body must be reduced to simple sugars. Glucose 
needs no digestion therefore, but the double sugars must be split 
by enzymes into two simple sugars in the intestinal juice, one 
for each kind, namely, sucrase (sucrose-splitting), maltase (mal- 
tose-splitting) and lactase (lactose-splitting). The digestion of 
starches and dextrins begins in the mouth, where amylase (starch- 
splitting) changes starch first to dextrin and finally to maltose, 
and maltase may change a little of the maltose so formed into 
glucose. In the stomach there are no enzymes acting on carbo- 
hydrates, but the digestion may continue under the influence of 
swallowed saliva for a time. In the pancreatic juice there is another 
amylase, which completes the splitting of starch to maltose, and 
then the intestinal maltase can reduce this to glucose, which will be 
absorbed. Cellulose -cannot be digested and simply serves to add 
bulk to the diet. 

-Digestion of fat. — A fat is made up of two parts, one a fatty 
acid, the other glycerol. Fat cannot be absorbed by the body until 
it is split into these two parts. A fat splitting enzyme is called a 
lipase. There is none in the mouth ; one in the stomach works only 
on fat in the state of emulsion; the most powerful is found in the 
pancreatic juice. Since fat cannot be digested in the mouth nor to 
any great extent in the stomach, it is bad to have food coated with 
it, for the protein and carbohydrates will have to wait till the fat is 
digested away, before they can be digested ; that is, till the intestine 
is reached. This is one reason why pastries and fried foods are hard 
to digest. 

Digestion of protein. — There are no enzymes in the mouth acting 
on protein. In the stomach, the hydrochloric acid helps to make it 
soften and swell, and then pepsin begins its digestion. Protein, 
like fat and carbohydrate, can be subdivided into smaller and 
smaller portions, finally being reduced to a form which the body can 
absorb, namely, amino acids, of which there may be 17 or 18 kinds 
from a single protein. 

The digestion in the stomach produces chiefly large fragments of 
the original protein, called proteoses. In the pancreatic juice is a 
powerful enzyme called trypsin, which digests proteins, first to frag- 
ments, next smaller than proteoses, called peptones, and finally 
breaks these peptones into amino acids. In the intestinal juice is 

2c 



386 APPENDIX 

another enzyme called erepsin, which also forms amino acids from 
proteoses and peptones, thus finishing any digestion of protein left 
incomplete by the trypsin. 

Fate of the absorbed foodstuffs 

Carbohydrates, absorbed as glucose or other monosaccharids, are 
carried by the portal blood to the liver, and thence passed into the 
blood, to be burned in the muscles, if needed for fuel, or stored tem- 
porarily in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a polysaccharid yield- 
ing glucose) for future conversion to sugar when required as fuel. 

Fats, passing through the intestinal wall as fatty acids and 
glycerol, enter the lymph largely as fat again, and finally pass to 
the blood to be burned in the muscles for fuel, or to be stored as fat 
until needed. 

Proteins pass into the blood as amino acids. Those needed for 
building material are taken up by the cells (especially cells of the 
muscles) and those not required for this purpose are freed from their 
nitrogen (in the liver or muscles) and then burned for fuel. 

For a fuller discussion of the fate of the absorbed foodstuffs see 
Chapter IV of Sherman's " Chemistry of Food and Nutrition."

Chemistry and its Relations to Daily Life 

By LOUIS KAHLENBERG and EDWIN B. HART 

Professors of Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin 

Cloth, 1 21110, ilhistrated, jpj pages. List % pricc, $1.25 



If the contributions of chemical science to modern civilization 
were suddenly swept away, what a blank there would be ! If, on 
the other hand, every person were acquainted with the elements of 
chemistry and its bearing upon our daily life, what an uplift human 
efficiency would receive ! It is to further this latter end that this 
book has been prepared. Designed particularly for use by students 
of agriculture and home economics in secondary schools, its use will 
do much to increase the efficiency of the farm and the home. In 
the language of modern educational philosophy, it " functions in the 
life of the pupil." 

Useful facts rather than mere theory have been emphasized, 
although the theory has not been neglected. The practical char- 
acter of the work is indicated by the following selected chapter 
headings -. 

IL The Composition and Uses of Water. 

IV. The Air, Nitrogen, Nitric Acid, and Ammonia. 

EX. Carbon and Its Compounds. 

XII. Paints, Oils, and Varnishes. 

XIIL Leather, Silk, Wool, Cotton, and Rubber. 

XV. Commercial Fertilizers. 

XVL Farm Manure. 

XX. Milk and Its Products. 

XXL Poisons for Farm and Orchard Pests.

Practical Physics 



By N. HENRY BLACK of the Roxbury Latin School, 
Boston, and Professor HARVEY N. DAVIS of Harvard 
University. 

Cloth, i2mo, illustrated, 488 pages. List price, %i.s; 

" In preparing this book," say the authors in the Preface, " we have tried to 
select only those topics which are of vital interest to young people, whether or 
not they intend to continue the study of physics in a college course. 

" In particular, we believe that the chief value of the informational side of 
such a course lies in its applications to the machinery of daily life. Everybody 
needs to know something about the working of electrical machinery, optical 
instruments, ships, automobiles, and all those labor-saving devices, such as 
vacuum cleaners, tireless cookers, pressure cookers, and electric irons, which 
are found in many American homes. We have, therefore, drawn as much of 
our illustrative material as possible from the common devices in modern life. 
We see no reason why this should detract in the least from the educational 
value of the study of physics, for one can learn to think straight just as well by 
thinking about an electrical generator, as by thinking about a Geissler tube. . . . 

" To understand any machine clearly, the student must have clearly in mind 
the fundamental principles involved. Therefore, although we have tried to 
begin each new topic, however short, with some concrete illustration familiar 
to young people, we have proceeded, as rapidly as seemed wise, to a deduction 
of the general principle. Then, to show how to make use of this principle, we 
have discussed other practical applications. We have tried to emphasize still 
further the value of principles, that is, generalizations, in science, by summariz- 
ing at the end of each chapter the principles discussed in that chapter. In 
these summaries we have aimed to make the phrasing brief and vivid so that 
it may be easily remembered and easily used." 

The new and noteworthy features of the book are the admirable 
selection of familiar material used to develop and apply the principles 
of physical science, the exceptionally clear and forceful exposition, 
showing the hand of the master teacher, the practical, interesting, 
thought-provoking problems, and the superior illustrations.

Botany for Secondary Schools 

By L. H. BAILEY 

Of Cornell University 

Cloth, i2mo, illustrated, 460 pages. List price, $1.25 

It is not essential nor desirable that everybody should become a botanist 
but it is inevitable that people shall be interested in the more human side 
of plant and animal life. We are interested in the evident things of natural 
history, and the greater our interest in such things, the wider is our horizon 
and the deeper our hold on life. 

The secondary school could not teach botanical science if it would ; lack of 
time and the immaturity of the pupils forbid it. But it can encourage a 
love of nature and an interest in plant study; indeed, it can originate these, 
and it does. Professor Bailey's Botany has been known to do it. 

In the revision of this book that has just been made, the effective simplicity 
of the nature teacher and the genuine sympathy of the nature lover are as 
successfully blended as they were in the former book. Bailey's Botany for 
Secondary Schools recognizes four or five general life principles : that no 
two natural things are alike ; that each individual has to make and main- 
tain its place through struggle with its fellows ; that " as the twig is bent 
the tree inclines " ; that " like produces like," and so on. From these 
simple laws and others like them Professor Bailey proceeds to unfold a 
wonderful story of plant individuals that have improved upon their race 
characteristics, of plant communities that have adopted manners from 
their neighbors, of features and characteristics that have been lost by 
plants because of changed conditions of life or surroundings. The story 
vibrates with interest. 

The book is, moreover, perfectly organized along the logical lines of 
approach to a scientific subject. Four general divisions of material insure 
its pedagogical success : 

PART I. — The Plant Itself; 

Part II. — The Plant in Its Relation to Environment and to Man; 

PART III. — Histology, or the Minute Structure of Plants ; 

PART IV. — The Kinds of Plants, including a Flora of 130 pages.

Studies in Literature 



By FREDERICK MONROE TISDEL 

Assistant Professor of English in the University of Missouri. 

Cloth, i2ino., illustrated, 333 pages, list price $.90 

In Part I of this book the author introduces the student to more than 
twenty standard English classics, giving in connection with each a brief 
explanatory introduction, suggestions for study and topics for oral and 
written discussion. These classics are grouped with respect to the dif- 
ferent types of literature which they represent, — epic, drama, essay, 
novel, etc., and there is a brief exposition of the type. The result is 
that in the mind of the reader the individual masterpiece and the type 
with its characteristics are inseparably connected. 

Part II consists of a brief but masterly survey of English literature. 
The book as a whole serves to systematize and unify the study of sec- 
ondary school literature, — a most desirable end. 

Professor E. A. Cross, State Teachers College, Greeley, Colo. " It meets 
with my heartiest approval. It is brief, considers all the writers high school 
students need to know, touches the interesting features in the lives and works 
of these men, ■ — about all you could want it to do." 

Mr. John B. Opdycke, English Department of the High School of Commerce, 
New York City. " I like it very much indeed. It has just enough in its re- 
view of the history of English literature, and its treatment of the classics is 
restrained and dignified. So far as I have seen, this is the only book that 
combines the two in one volume. I am all against the use of an abstract 
. History of English Literature in the high school and I am all in favor of put- 
ting into the hands of the students some book that analyzes classics fully and 
yet with restraint. This book seems to have combined the two in just the 
right proportions and treated them in just the right manner."

PREFACE 

THIS volume, like its companion, Shelter and Clothing, is in- 
tended for use in the course in household arts in the high 
school and normal school, whether the work be vocational or 
general in its aim. It is hoped that both volumes will prove 
useful in the home as well, including as they do a treatment 
of the homecrafts, and the related topics now so significant to 
the home maker, the cost and purchasing of foods and 
clothing, the cost of operating, the management of the home, 
and questions of state and city sanitation vital to the health 
of the individual family. 

The volume treats specifically of foods, their production, 
sanitation, cost, nutritive value, preparation, and serving, these 
topics being closely interwoven with the practical aspects of 
household management, and they are followed by a study of 
the household budget and accounts, methods of buying, house- 
wifery, and laundering. It includes about 160 carefully se- 
lected and tested recipes, together with a large number of 
cooking exercises of a more experimental nature designed to 
develop initiative and resourcefulness. Shelter and Clothing 
deals with the organization and ideals of the home, house sani- 
tation, decoration, and furnishing ; and treats in full, textiles, 
sewing, costume design, and dressmaking. 

Some of the recipes here given are adapted from those of 
such authorities as Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Farmer, and Miss Bar- 
rows, and others are original and from private sources. 

The authors are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to 
those who have read and criticized the manuscript : Professor 



yi PREFACE 

Mary Swartz Rose of Teachers College, for her criticism and 
contributions to the book ; Miss L. Kay Balderston, of Teach- 
ers College, for reading the chapters on Housewifery and 
Laundering ; Professor May B. Van Arsdale, of Teachers Col- 
lege, for reading the chapters on Food ; Professor Van Ars- 
dale, Miss Bertha E. Shapleigh, and Miss Mary H. Peacock 
for their assistance in arranging for photographs ; Miss Laura 
B. Whittemore, formerly of Teachers College, and Miss Amy 
L. Logan of the Horace Mann School for criticizing the manu- 
script from the point of view of the high school teacher ; and 
also Professor Hermann Vulte for his kind assistance. 



SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS 

THE topics in this volume are so arranged that they can be 
followed in sequence as the course of study develops through 
the year, with such modifications as seem necessary to the 
teacher in order that the work may best meet the needs of the 
pupils. The practice has become/quite general of beginning 
the practical work in the autumn with the preparation and 
preservation of fruit, especially for those pupils who have had 
previous work in foods ; and this plan commends itself as be- 
ing seasonable and as making an appeal to the interest of the 
pupils. The opening chapters furnish material that is in part 
preliminary and that may also be studied as the practical work 
progresses from Chapter V onward. The preparation of a 
meal need not be deferred until all types of dishes have been 
cooked singly, as it is possible to prepare a luncheon box, to 
set an invalid tray, or to serve a simple breakfast quite early 
in the course, provided the equipment permits. If the school 
program allows, it is well to give a period to recitation at 
stated intervals, which would include a discussion of the text 
and of problems that arise from the laboratory work. The 
cost of food is a topic to be borne in mind throughout the 
year. It is an excellent plan for the pupils to record the 
current prices of each food material as it is used, and the cost 
of a given dish for a given number of people, the topic culmi- 
nating in a detailed discussion when the chapter on the cost of 
food is read. A similar method may be pursued in connection 
with the nutritive values of food, the theme developing from 
lesson to lesson, until the pupils are ready for the chapter on 



Viii SUGGESTIONS fO TEACHERS 

menus and dietaries. An occasional lesson on housewifery 01 
laundering may be introduced from time to time, if a complete 
sequence of lessons on these topics does not seem practicable ; 
and through the year the pupils may be encouraged to keep 
simple accounts for themselves' and in connection with the 
supplies of the school kitchen. Those teachers are fortunate 
who may cooperate with a school lunch room, thus affording 
their pupils opportunity for dealing with practical administra- 
tive and economic problems. The way in which the topics are 
used must of necessity vary with the previous experience of 
the pupils, whether or not they have had cookery, chemistry, 
and physiology, and the teacher will use the exercises at the 
end of the chapters with freedom, omitting some questions, 
and adding others as the need arises.

FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD 
MANAGEMENT 

CHAPTER I 
FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 

Food problems. " What shall I plan for the three 
meals? " is a question as new each day as the day itself. 
That many women ask it, and are glad for an answer or a 
suggestion is proved by a glance at the daily or weekly paper 
or woman's magazine, whose publishers know that it pays 
to print menus innumerable. Indeed, the daily press is full 
of signs that the food problem is an acute one, for the cur- 
rent joke about food prices, the accounts of boycotts by house- 
keepers, popular articles on nutrition and pure foods, and the 
records of state and national legislation, all show that as a 
nation we are awake and seeking a way out of our present 
difficulties. 

Doubtless, the housekeeper has always found the task of 
supplying food to her family one of the most perplexing, but 
modern conditions have made the difficulties manifold when 
contrasted with olden times. A pretty picture of household 
management in seventeenth century England is drawn by Sir 
Walter Scott in " Peveril of the Peak." The lord of the 
castle has invited the village people to a great feast in cele- 
bration of the restoration of Charles the Second, and Lady 
Peveril finds her larder rather low. To be sure, there are 
B 1

carp in the pond, and deer in the park, but the beef question 
is puzzling, for the steward does not wish to kill his choice 
steer. Then appear in the courtyard two fine oxen, and 
several wethers, or sheep, gifts from a neighbor, and the 
menu is complete. Lady Peveril is described as an excellent 
housekeeper, and doubtless felt burdened by many cares, 
but how different were her problems from ours, and how 
simple by comparison ! Beef trusts and the high price of 
beef, tuberculous cattle, unsanitary transportation and 
markets were not factors in her problem. In her day, and 
in the time of our grandmothers, less variety in diet was 
possible, and less expected except on state occasions; food 
was not transported over great distances, and the cost was 
not so much out of proportion to the average income. 

Now every large city, and even the small town, is the mar- 
ket of the world. We have long been accustomed to the im- 
portation of oranges and lemons, and dried fruits from distant 
lands ; but now we have peaches and pears from South Africa, 
melons from Spain, pineapples from the Azores, hothouse 
grapes from England, and apples from Australia, and in 
1913, we read of the shipment of beef 'from Argentina. In 
our own country, early fruits and vegetables travel from the 
south to the north, so that the season of some foods is long 
extended. The large amount of canned food also does away 
with the natural limits of the season, and this is further 
affected by cold storage. Both the quality and the cost 
of food are modified by these new methods of commerce, and 
furthermore, modern methods of manufacture have changed 
the quality. In an ideal community these changes would 
be for the better, but manufacturers often think more of 
their own profit than of the quality of their goods, and as a 
result adulterations have crept in, making necessary the 
enactment and enforcement of pure food laws. This is by 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 3 

no means so simple a matter as it seems, for we must first 
understand what pure food really is. 

Instinct guides somewhat in the selection of food where con- 
ditions of living are simple. Under more complex conditions 
there must be a scientific study of the whole situation in 
order that the individual may cope with it. Then, too, with 
such a variety of foods from which to select, it is easy to be 
tempted beyond our means, and to disregard the simple and 
the wholesome. We know that it is easy to develop a taste 
for some one food in excess, as for instance, sweets or dishes 
rich in fat and too highly flavored, and the physician adds his 
word here to the plea for a study of food and its functions. 

The conclusion is this, that the housekeeper who has the 
welfare of her family at heart will not] confine her interest 
in food to cooking processes and new recipes. Good cooks 
we must have, and our standard of cooking could easily be 
raised. But other facts about food are important to-day, and 
as we learn to prepare and serve food daintily, we must study 
such topics as the following : 

What food is, its composition and how it nourishes us; 
how it is manufactured and transported; " pure food' 7 ; 
sanitary and convenient markets ; the cost of food and how 
to buy; principles of food preparation; suitable combina- 
tions and amounts of food. These topics are all treated 
in this volume, and should be considered as important as the 
actual preparation of food. 

FOOD MATERIALS 

What is food ? This would seem to be a difficult ques- 
tion to answer as we look about a modern grocery or market 
with its bewildering assortment of foods. It seems hardly 
possible to describe such a variety of articles in a brief sen- 



4 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tence, or to find a definition that will apply to all. Yet we 
seem to know instinctively what food is, although we may 
not find it easy to give a definition. Even the lower animals 
are guided in selecting food by some natural instinct and 
seldom make a mistake. 

A widely used government bulletin gives this definition : 
" Food is that which taken into the body builds tissue or 
yields energy or does both." Probably we have learned this 
in our physiology, and admit it to be true, but for practical 
purposes, we need a more complete statement than this. 
Let us carefully determine what our foods really are, and 
what elements they contain, in order that we may select 
wisely for purposes of nutrition, and also that we may learn 
how to prepare food materials in a way that will utilize every- 
thing in them and waste nothing. 

Vegetable and animal foods. It is easy to divide food 
materials in a general way into those derived from the vege- 
table kingdom and those derived from the animal kingdom. 
In the vegetable group we have first, the different parts of 
many plants, and second, substances manufactured from 
plants. While we do not usually eat the whole of any one 
plant, yet there is not any part of the plant that we have not 
adopted as food. We use roots and tubers in beets, carrots, 
and potatoes, and the onion is a bulb. In celery and 
asparagus we eat the plant stalk. Plant leaves give us 
lettuce and other salads, cabbage and the like. Peas and 
beans and nuts are seeds, and cauliflower is a part of the 
flower. The fruit as a whole is familiar in many forms. 
Manufactured vegetable food materials include flour, meals, 
breakfast cereals, starch, sugar, molasses and sirups. The 
animal kingdom gives us the flesh of animals, fish and shell 
fish, and substances derived from animals, like eggs, milk, 
and the milk products, cream, butter, and cheese. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 5 

These materials vary so much in appearance that they 
would seem to have nothing in common. If, however, we 
compare the food of different animals and different races of 
men, we cannot but conclude that this is a mistaken judg- 
ment. We find an animal like the lion feeding entirely upon 
the flesh of other animals, and a strong creature like the ox, 
eating nothing but grass and grain. We also note that one 
race of men includes meat in its diet, and another subsists 
almost entirely upon vegetable food, such as rice and beans. 
Yet in both cases, these diverse kinds of food accomplish the 
same end, body building and the supplying of energy. 
Let us study two common foods, from the two kingdoms, 
and see if through this study we can discover in what ways 
they are alike. 

Comparison of milk and beans. A moment's thought 
enables us to see that in milk we have a food that must have 
all the elements needed in nutrition, since it is the only food 
taken by many young animals. The baby and the young 
calf find in it everything that is needed to build the growing 
body, and to give them energy. If you see a young calf 
frisking about the field, you can appreciate how well his food 
supplies his needs. 

A simple experiment will help us to find some of the sub- 
stances contained in milk. Let the milk stand until the 
cream rises on the top. Skim the cream, warm it slightly 
and beat it with an egg beater. Butter will soon " come," 
and butter, we know, is a form of fat. Warm a pint of the 
skimmed milk, add to it a dissolved rennet tablet, and set it 
in a warm place. In a short time, the milk becomes solidified 
to a consistency like that of jelly. If allowed to stand longer, 
a watery liquid will separate itself from the solid portion. 
These are the " curds and whey " that result, also, from 
the souring of milk. The whey can be squeezed out of the 



6 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

curd, leaving it quite dry. . We have now found at least three 
constituents of milk, water, fat, and curd. 

You may then surmise from the sweet taste of milk that 
sugar is present; the chemist knows how to obtain it in 
pure form as " sugar of milk." The chemist also finds cer-

tain mineral substances which remain behind when all the 
water is evaporated and the curds and sugar burned away. 
These mineral substances are spoken of by the chemist as 
" ash," because this is what remains after burning the other 
portions of a food material, as ashes remain from a wood fire. 
Figure 1 shows you these substances in the amounts in which 
each occurs in a pint of milk. The sugar is one of a class of 
substances to which the chemist gives the name carbohy- 
drate. To the substance in the curd that is different from 
all the other substances in the milk the name " protein " is 
given. 

We will now turn to the composition of beans, for in beans 
we find food stored up to nourish the young plant, which we, 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 



also, appropriate as food. The composition of both the milk 
and the beans is given in this table. Compare also Figures 
35 and 41.

Notice that the substances in the beans are the same in 
general nature as those in the milk, although the amounts are 
different. The water that the young plant needs is, of course, 
supplied from the earth. There is another difference to 
note although this is not shown in^the table; in the beans 
the carbohydrate is of two kinds, sugar and starch. 



FOODSTUFFS l 

All the varieties of food with which we are supplied will 
be found to contain some of these substances : protein, fat, 
carbohydrate, mineral matter, water; and to these we give 
the name foodstuffs. Some food materials (like the milk 
and beans just studied) contain all the foodstuffs, some only 
one, as in the case of sugar. We can now define food as 
something that contains one or more of the substances 
known as foodstuffs. But what are the foodstuffs them- 
selves ? 

Elements in the foodstuffs. Although we are not 
chemists, and may not even have taken a course in chemistry, 



1 TEACHER'S NOTE. The term "foodstuff" is used in place of "food 
principle," as being the later and better term. 



8 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

yet through our nature study or physiology lessons, we are 
familiar with the fact that all the materials about us, in- 
cluding our own bodies and our food, are made up of simple 
substances that we call " elements." We know, for instance, 
that coal is chiefly carbon, and we are familiar with such sub- 
stances as sulphur, calcium, phosphorus, and iron. We 
-know that the air contains oxygen, which we inhale, and 
that we breathe out a combination of carbon and oxygen 
called " carbon dioxide." Since our bodies are composed 
of these and other elements, these elements must be supplied 
by our foods, and therefore, the foodstuffs in turn are com- 
posed of these same elements. 

Proteins, fats, and carbohydrates all contain large amounts 
of carbon, and on this account are called fuel foods. But 
proteins are distinguished because they contain nitrogen in 
addition, which is found in no other foodstuff. Sulphur, 
too, we get only from protein, but we need less of it than of 
nitrogen, so we think about the nitrogen and let the sulphur 
take care of itself. The nitrogen that we draw in from the 
air with every breath, we breathe out again without being 
able to use it. This element is necessary to every living cell, 
but we can make it ours only through our protein food. 
Nitrogen is cheapest when obtained from the grains, from 
dried beans and peas. We pay a higher price for it in milk, 
eggs, fish, meat, and nuts. Carbon, which is found in all 
foodstuffs except water and some kinds of mineral matter, 
costs much less, especially when we take it in the form of 
carbohydrates such as starches and sugars. Oxygen is also 
abundant in our foods, but we get it even more cheaply in 
water and by breathing it in from the air. Phosphorus, 
iron, and calcium are very important elements, but we do 
not need them in very large quantities. We can get them 
cheaply in whole grains, peas and beans, some fruits and 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 9 

green vegetables, but they are worth paying for in milk and 
eggs. The elements last mentioned are present in the food 
partly as constituents of certain proteins and fats, partly 
as mineral salts. Other elements found as mineral matter 
are sodium and chlorine (which we take as common salt), 
potassium, magnesium, and traces of iodine and fluorine. 
These are all necessary to keep our bodies in good working 
order. We shall see later how to select our food materials 
so as to have all the different elements in the foodstuffs 
present in sufficient amounts. 

FUNCTIONS OF THE FOODSTUFFS 

Food for energy. The first requirement of the body is 
for fuel, because it has a great deal of work to do. Even 
when one lies perfectly quiet and appears to be resting, the 
heart is working to keep up the circulation of the blood, the 
chest and diaphragm muscles are working to maintain the 
oxygen supply to the lungs, the alimentary tract is moving 
food material along, working to digest it and get rid of waste, 
and the skeletal muscles are being held up to " tone " so as 
to be ready for further action. All this work that we scarcely 
realize, may be called involuntary. To it we may add all 
sorts of voluntary movements, from simply speaking a word 
to turning somersaults or lifting heavy weights. All work 
involves energy, which we can obtain only from the fuel foods, 
proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. 

Energy takes different forms. Our supply comes from the 
sun in the forms of heat and light, and plants store it up in 
the form of chemical energy when they build carbohydrates, 
fats, and proteins. This may be changed into the forms of 
work or of heat when we eat the food. Whenever an attempt 
is made to change chemical energy to work, some of it will 

V 



10 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

change to heat. So in our bodies, the fuel foods, which 
enable us to do both involuntary and voluntary work, fur- 
nish heat at the same time, to keep our bodies warm. When 
we are too cold, we can shiver or run or jump, and thus, by 
doing more work, get more heat too. 

The unit of fuel value. In our studies of food materials, 
we must find out just how much energy, or working power, 
can be obtained from each kind. We must have a measure 
of energy or fuel value ; and just as the inch is a measure of 
length, and the pound of weight, so the Calorie serves as a 
measure of fuel value. This unit x measures energy as heat, 
being the amount of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of 
water 1 C. (or 1 pound of water about 4 F.), but we can 
express it also as work, being sufficient energy to raise a 
1 -pound weight 3087 feet into the air (or 1 ton about lj feet) 
if it were possible to convert it into mechanical work without 
loss. By burning foods in pure oxygen in a vessel placed in 
water so that all the heat is given off to the water, and then 
noting the change in temperature of the water, it is possible 
to find out just how much energy each will yield. Such a 
device is called a calorimeter. In the body there is usually a 
small portion of each kind of foodstuff which escapes diges- 
tion, and protein is not quite so completely burned as in the 
calorimeter. When allowance for the probable loss is made, 
the energy values of the fuel foodstuffs are as follows : 

Protein 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound 

Fat 9 Calories per gram or 4082 per pound. 

Carbohydrate .... 4 Calories per gram or 1814 per pound. 

The standard portion. Knowing the composition of any 
food material, it is possible from these figures to calculate 

1 This is the "greater calorie" or "kilogram calorie," and is written 
Calorie to distinguish it from the "lesser calorie" or "gram calorie," largely 
used in physics and chemistry. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 11 

the total fuel value, or we can refer to tables in which this 
has been calculated, and save ourselves labor. For com- 
parison of different foods the Standard, or 100-Calorie, 
Portion is used, as this corresponds very closely with the 
amount of food 'for a single serving in many cases. In the 
sections treating of different foods the Standard Portion will 
be stated. 

Food for body building. Every living cell has a little 
life history of its own, and constantly demands a certain 
amount of. new material to replace old which it has worn out. 
Besides this, old cells die, and new ones have to be made to 
replace them. Hence even a full-grown person needs build- 
ing material, and much more is required in proportion when 
the person is growing and perhaps adding several ounces 
a week to his weight. The foodstuffs which have especial 
value as building material are protein and mineral matter. 

Food for body regulating. To help in the digestion of 
food, to keep the blood in proper condition, the muscles 
supple, and all the processes of the body at their best, ash 
constituents and water in the diet are necessary. A tabular 
summary of the functions of the foodstuffs and an outline of 
the changes which take place in digestion will be found in the 
appendix. 

We are now able to give a more complete answer to our 
question, " What is Food? " 

Food has been said to be that which taken into the body 
builds tissue or yields energy, or both. The food as a whole 
must contain all the chemical elements needed by the body, 
these elements being supplied in substances known as food- 
stuffs, viz., protein, fat, carbohydrates, mineral matter or 
ash, water. To be a food, a substance must contain one or 
all of the foodstuffs. 

It must be noted here that our food materials as bought, 



12 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

contain inedible matter, as in the shells of eggs, the bone of 
meat, the skins and pods of vegetables. Moreover, the fiber 
that we eat in vegetable foods is not digested under ordinary 
circumstances, but seems rather to serve a useful purpose in 
giving bulk to our foods. 

Food adjuncts. In preparing foods for the table, we 
have the habit of adding substances to develop or give flavor. 
With the exception of sugar, which we use largely for its 
agreeable taste, these substances have no nutritive value. 
They are not hurtful unless used in excess, although pepper 
and other spices sometimes disturb digestion. Pepper, too, 
irritates a delicate throat. 

Only a few flavors are really detected by the sense of 
taste. These are salt, sugar, acids; and something in the 
spices that gives a sensation hard to describe, but is unmis- 
takable in an overdose of mustard or horse-radish. " Pun- 
gent " is the descriptive word for such a flavor. 

The other flavors are really odors, and are detected by 
the sense of smell. Have you not at some time seemed to 
lose the sense of taste when suffering from a severe cold in 
the head? Yet even then you could taste sugar, salt, 
vinegar, and feel the pungency of pepper. These other 
flavors or odors are due to a volatile oil in the flavoring 
material, that is, an oil that readily evaporates, especially 
when heated, as distinguished from the non-volatile oils and 
fats like olive oil and butter. This is a practical bit of knowl- 
edge in our cookery, for whatever passes off as fragrance 
during the cooking process, is lost as flavor. For instance, 
to cook vanilla essence in a soft custard is equivalent to 
throwing most of it away. 

Salt. A mineral substance that develops other flavors. It 
should not be used in excess. A small amount is desirable even in 
sweet dishes. 



FOOD MATERIALS AND FOODSTUFFS 13 

Acids. Vinegar, lemon juice, and juices of other sour fruits. 
These are pleasing in themselves, and in small quantities develop 
other flavors and give a certain brightness of taste. They are 
used with meat and fish, and in sweet dishes. 

Spices. Red, black, and white pepper, cinnamon, cloves, all- 
spice, nutmeg, mace, and ginger are examples. They are made 
from the seeds of certain plants, used whole or ground. Stick cinna- 
mon is a layer of a stem. Ginger is a root. 

Herbs. Thyme, mint, sweet marjoram, summer savory are 
the leaves of old-fashioned pot herbs, used either fresh or dried. 
There were many others used in olden days that are not common 
now, such as sweet basil and pot marigold. A quite complete list 
will be found nowadays in any good seed catalogue. These herbs 
are used with meat dishes. 

Vegetable flavors. Celery seeds and stalks, onions, leek and 
garlick, carrots and turnips, all contain flavoring oils, and we use 
them for their flavors in small portions, in meat dishes. 

Essences. The oils of vanilla, bitter almonds, lemon and orange 
peel are dissolved in alcohol, and used in liquid form in cakes and 
desserts. Violet leaves and violet essence are sometimes used, but 
are a fad as a flavor. Rose water made from rose leaves is an old- 
fashioned flavoring, used infrequently now in blancmanges. The 
fresh leaf of a rose geranium gives a pleasing flavor, for occasional 
use. Chocolate, coffee, and tea are used for flavorings as well as for 
beverages. 

Coloring substances. These come of many colors made from 
aniline dyes, and while probably not often hurtful, they should be 
used only in sweets and candies, and very seldom, if ever. It is 
better to depend on natural fruit coloring when color is wanted. 

The fine art of cooking is to develop the natural flavor of 
each foodstuff by the proper application of heat, and never 
to use these condiments and flavorings in excess. The artist 
in cookery has a gift for flavoring, somewhat as the painter 
has for color. 

Beverages. The dictionary defines " beverage " as 
" drink of any kind." The word is used in different forms in 
several languages and is traced back to the Latin bibere, 



14 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

to drink. The common beverages will be studied in detail 
in connection with their preparation. They have slight 
nutritive value, save for the added milk, cream, and sugar. 
Cocoa and chocolate contain fat, and so have to be classed 
as foods. Milk is not a beverage, strictly speaking, but a 
food, and should be counted as a part of a meal.

KITCHEN FURNISHINGS

shining with cleanliness ; and the kitchen furnishings should 
have their fair share of the money spent in buying furniture 
for the house.

Plan of the kitchen. Here the motto should be " Save 
-steps." How many weary miles do women walk within their 
kitchen walls because the sink, the stove, the refrigerator 
and the closets for food and dishes are put in to fit the spaces 
allowed by the windows and doors, with no thought of the 
rapid and easy dispatch of work. 

Figure 2 shows the plan of a kitchen, of the " buffet " type, 
suitable for a small home or apartment. As this plan is 
drawn it would be necessary to use either electric apparatus,

or a small gas stove upon one of the tables. A large gas 
stove could stand in place of the table at (1), or against the 
wall at (2), pushing the table at (3) nearer the door. The 
cupboards at -(4) and (5) should be raised, leaving table 
space at both the right and left of the sink. Notice that the 
ice box is in the entry, and also that there is a cupboard that 
could be used for food. The china cupboard is conveniently 
near in the dining-room. 

Figure 3 shows a larger kitchen, with a serving room be- 
tween it and the dining-room. The ice box is in the outer 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 17 

wall and is filled from the outside. The cupboard at (1) could 
hold the cooking utensils, as it stands conveniently between 
the sink and the range. A kitchen as large as this should 
have a sm&ll table on rollers for carrying food materials and 
utensils back and forth. If you have ever visited the kitchen 
in a dining-car you will realize that compactness is one 
of the advantages of the small kitchen over the large, although 
the latter may be better ventilated and cooler. 

Furnishing the kitchen. The walls and floors, and even 
the ceiling, should be washable. A tiled wall is as easy to 
wash as a china dish, but the expense is prohibitive in many 
cases. Table "oilcloth for wall and ceiling is very satis- 
factory ; next to this in desirability is paint, and for the last 
choice a washable paper. This paper will bear scarcely 
more than a damp cloth for cleansing purposes, however. 
Avoid cracks and crevices in the woodwork, having all 
surfaces as plain as possible. 

The best floor is one covered with an inlaid linoleum, 
which gives warmth and comfort to the foot, is easy to clean, 
and wears for many years (Fig. 4). It should be cemented 
down at the edges that no dust may collect. The first cost 
is rather high, but it pays in the end. A hardwood floor of 
maple or yellow pine is also satisfactory. Tiling is the 
cleanest of all floorings, but is very fatiguing to the worker. 

Enamel-paint makes a smooth finish for the woodwork. 
In the kitchen of the future, which will be fireproof, steel 
fittings will probably take the place of all wood.

No plan can be drawn that would be perfect in all situations. 
If you ever have the opportunity to plan your own kitchen, 
decide just what you want it to contain, and then plan the 
places for each article. Sometimes there are too many drawers 
and shelves, and these not of the right size or position.

The kitchen table. The table should have a top with 
room for food materials and utensils to stand in neat order 
without crowding. Glass is the cleanest top, painted steel 
and hard maple coming next in order. Have some arrange- 
ment of shelves and drawers that small utensils and some food 
materials may be always at hand. Figure 6 shows a kitchen 
" cabinet " of painted steel with such conveniences. Notice 
the bin for flour, and the inverted jar for sugar, both with an 
opening at the bottom. Spices and flavorings and materials 
needed in small quantities are kept in jars on the shelves. 
The cupboard and drawers beneath will hold small utensils, 
towels, and whatever proves to be needed close by. Several 
makes of such cabinets are now on sale. A flat-topped table 
for a large kitchen, Fig. 5, could have drawers and cup- 
boards below. If the outlay for a cabinet seems too great, 
the bins for sugar and flour may be purchased separately 
and fastened on the wall above the table, and one or two 
shelves screwed on the wall for the jars, with hooks fastened 
in underneath on which a few small utensils may be hung. 

A small rolling table may be made inexpensively by putting 
castors on a light table costing not more than a dollar. Put 
table oilcloth over the top. This is a great convenience in 
many ways. The height of the table should be such that the 
worker is not fatigued by bending over. Thirty-two inches 
is a good table height for a woman of five feet four or five 
inches. Blocks hollowed to fit the table legs may be used 
with a table of ordinary height for a tall person. 

Cupboards and shelves. If you purchase a cupboard 
see that the shelves are movable, and of varying widths. 
There are a few large utensils that need a deep shelf, about 
fifteen inches. If the shelves are to be built in, provide several 
widths from six to ten inches. Much space is sometimes 
wasted between shelves. Vary the distances here.

hanging cups from the bottom

the trap and faucets should be nickel plate. 

An iron sink should be rubbed and polished until it becomes 
very smooth. Do not attempt to paint it. If it is left 
perfectly dry, it will not rust. 

Hot water supply. A good supply is essential to rapid 
and thorough work. The apartment dweller who finds it 
piped to the sink is most fortunate. The separate house 
must have a boiler connected with the coal range, or a water

is used it is economy to have it covered with some non-

Utensils. The expert cook is known by the small number 
of utensils that she uses. If you watch the expert at work, 
you will see too, that each utensil is exactly fitted to its use. 

The skilled cook is like the carpenter or painter, and her 
set of tools is individual. The list given on page 28 is a 
sample one, to be changed to suit the individual preference, 
and increased as the need arises; it could be smaller, if

necessary. When you first furnish a kitchen, avoid an 
elaborate display of tools, beginning with the few essentials 
only. 

No one material is suitable for the construction of all 
utensils. Those subjected to intense heat must be of material 
able to resist it. The material for a given utensil must be se- 
lected with the purpose of the utensil in mind. The material 
should be durable, easy to clean, and of such a nature that 
it does not affect chemically the food material cooked in it. 

Aluminium. A white metal, fairly durable, very light in weight. 
Discolors easily, and is not easy to clean. Expensive. Used for all 
kinds of utensils. 

Copper. Endures heat, durable, fairly light to handle. Hard 
to keep clean. Expensive. Used for kettles. Not desirable for 
family use. 

Earthenware. Will not endure the highest temperatures with- 
out crackling. Easily breakable. Easy to clean, unless crackled. 
Inexpensive. Useful for slow oven processes, for pitchers and mix- 
ing bowls. 

Enamel. A vitrified material upon iron or steel. The English 
enamel ware upon iron is durable, excellent for preserving, heavy. 
The German and American enamels are lighter. Avoid the attrac- 
tive blue, and blue and white except for pitchers, cups, bowls, and 
plates. They crackle and chip off more easily with heat then the 
gray enamels. One German make, of a dark mottled gray, is less 
brittle in the finish than most American makes. All the enamels 
are easy to keep clean. Used for kettles, saucepans, roasting, 
and baking. Less durable than steel and iron. 

Iron. Endures intense heat. Durable. Heavy to handle. 
Becomes smooth with long use, and then is not difficult to clean. 
Affects the color of acid fruits. Not expensive. Used for frying 
kettles and pans and kettles for boiling. 

Russia iron is a sheet iron of good quality for roasting and 
bread pans. Expensive. 

Steel. Endures intense heat. Durable. Medium weight. 
Fairly easy to clean. Affects acid fruits. Medium cost. Same 
uses as iron, also for roasting and baking pans, and smaller kettles. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 27 

Tin. Tin, a " useful metal," is plated on thin sheet iron for 
utensils. So called block tin is the best quality. Will not endure 
intense heat. The tin wears and scratches off with use. Not 
easy to clean. Discolors easily, and colors acid fruit. Poor tin 
ware is not worth buying. Good quality is not cheap. May be 
used for measures, and for small saucepans, but is less desirable 
than other wares. 

Wooden ware. Used for molding boards, meat boards, and 
spoons. 

The patterns of utensils. Select those made without 
seams, or flutings, where food particles collect. Bowls, 
saucepans, and kettles should have a lip on the side, for the 
pouring out of liquids. A pitcher should be of such shape 
that it can be easily washed, and it should have a lip that 
will pour well. A pot for boiling coffee should have a lip 
and not a spout. Select utensils with non-conducting 
handles. 

Study carefully the selection of knives, and do not try to 
economize in their purchase. Knives must be sharp, and 
poor quality steel will never take a good edge. A worn table 
knife of Sheffield steel, when ground down, makes the best of 
kitchen knives. Buy a good sharpener and use it frequently. 

Labor-saving devices. A good machine saves the wear 
and tear of human muscle, and also much time. If you have 
studied the principles of the lever and other mechanical 
devices, you will understand why this is. 1 

Learn to pay for, use, and clean good machines.

Care of the kitchen. The daily cleaning must include 
the care of the sink and traps, the cleaning of the stove, 
brushing the floor, and washing off of tables. More thorough 
cleaning includes the scrubbing of the floor, washing of walls, 
woodwork, and windows, cleaning of closets and drawers. 



KITCHEN FURNISHINGS 31 

The stoves should be rubbed often with paper, and washed 
thoroughly when necessary. Great pains must be taken to 
keep the ovens clean, by frequent washing out. Gas burners 
must be taken off and boiled in a solution of sal soda 
once in a while. The top and bottom of coal ovens should 
be cleaned out once a month. Kerosene stoves need con- 
stant cleaning. Stove blacking makes the stove more 
attractive. 

Dish-washing. It is not difficult to wash dishes well, 
although many people make it a very disagreeable process. 
The necessary apparatus is given in the utensil list. The 
cleansing materials include a plentiful supply of hot water, 
a good soap, ammonia or borax to soften the water, a gritty 
soap or powder. Have a pan for washing and another for 
rinsing, and a tray for draining if there is no drainer attached 
to the sink. 

Order of work. Prepare the dishes by scraping and neatly 
piling articles of a kind together. Rub greasy dishes with soft 
paper, and put water and ammonia or washing powder into utensils 
that need soaking. Have clean towels at hand. Make ready a 
pan of hot soap suds, by using a soap shaker, or soap solution, but 
do not put the cake of soap in the pan. Have rinsing water ready. 

Wash the cleanest dishes first, usually the glasses, next the cups 
and saucers, and the silver next. Have the soiled dishes near the 
pan, and put in only one or two articles at a time, washing with 
mop or dish cloth. To pile in a number means the nicking of 
china, and scratching of silver. Dip each dish in the rinsing water 
and then put in the drainer. If there is not room for two pans, 
the dishes may be piled on the drainer not too many at a time, 
and the rinsing water poured over. Be careful not to use too hot 
water for delicate china and glass. Change the soapy water when 
it becomes in the least greasy. 

Wipe the dishes while they are still warm, and use dry towels. 

Wash the utensils thoroughly, especially on the bottom. Heavy 
utensils can be dried without wiping, on or near the stove. Do 
not put any utensils away until they are perfectly dry. 



32 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Steel knives should be scoured and thoroughly rinsed and 
dried. Wash out the towels and dishpan, and leave the sink and 
drainboard perfectly clean. It does take time and work for this 
whole process, but spotless cleanliness is our aim. 1 

Home dish-washers are being devised, and should save some of 
the labor. None as yet has proved very satisfactory.

CHAPTER III 
FUEL AND STOVES 

THE fuels most widely used in this country are coal, gas, 
and kerosene. Wood is still used for cooking by those who 
own wood lots, or who live in a district where wood is abun- 
dant, but in a sense it is the fuel of the past. Electricity is 
generated from coal except in the few communities where 
the electric current is derived through machinery from the 
energy of falling water but electricity is not in common 
household use, and is still the method of the future for the 
average family. Other substances are burned for fuel 
occasionally or in restricted localities. Corn cobs are used 
sometimes in the corn belt. Peat is an old-world fuel. 
It is a vegetable substance taken in blocks from marshes, 
in reality the first stage of coal formation. It is a slow-burning 
fuel which is cheap in its own locality. 

Economy of fuel is a world problem, for it is evident that 
the coal supply will be exhausted in course of time, and this 
is true also of coal oil or petroleum, Scientists are experi- 
menting to discover practical methods, not dependent upon 
the burning of coal, for generating electricity. Water power 
is the only practicable method so far, and to make it per- 
manently available we must conserve the forests still remain- 
ing to us, and thus safeguard the sources of our rivers. 

Another effort toward economy is seen in the use for fuel 

of waste products treated in some way to make them readily 

combustible. The briquet is used in Europe where the fuel 

supply is limited. It is made of sawdust or waste coal, with 

D 33 



34 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

some petroleum, tar, resin, or other substance, heated together 
and molded. Good briquets yield a large amount of heat in 
proportion to bulk and weight. The problem here, as with 
all waste, is to find a manufacturing process that will make 
the product cheap enough to be practical for 'common 
use. 

It is a natural impulse to use lavishly whatever is at hand 
in abundance, and it is only a highly civilized community 
that takes thought for the economy of the future. Con- 
sidered only from a selfish point of view, however, with coal 
and petroleum at the high prices that are likely to prevail, 
the saving of fuel is one of our most important economies. 

The common fuels. Coal is of two kinds, anthracite 
and bituminous, or hard and soft. Hard coal of good quality 
has 90 per cent or more of carbon, and burns with little 
flame. Soft coal contains as much as 18 per cent of flame- 
making substances, and gives off a heavy smoke. Hard 
coal is therefore cleaner, but it is more costly than soft coal, 
because the supply is smaller. The most important anthra- 
cite mines are found in the eastern United States, and hard 
coal is used more in this section than elsewhere. Good hard 
coal may be recognized by its glossy black color and bright 
surfaces. It is sold under different names taken often from 
the locality where it is mined. There are two kinds, one 
leaving a reddish ash, and the other a white. The red ash 
coal burns more freely than the white ash and the ash is 
heavier and therefore cleaner. The price is higher per ton 
or bag. 

Coal is sorted in different sizes, a medium size being best 
for the ordinary range. Poor coal has slaty pieces in it, 
that will not burn but break up and mingle with the ashes. 
You can learn to detect it by the slaty color. Clinkers are 
formed by unburnable minerals, mixed with the coal, that 



FUEL AND STOVES 35 

melt and stick together, and even adhere to the lining or the 
grate. They are not often troublesome in the cooking range. 

Coal is measured by the ton of two thousand pounds avoir- 
dupois. A common hod of coal holds about thirty pounds. 
Coal should be bought in large quantity, and stored away 
in summer, if possible. The retail dealer in the city often 
charges an exorbitant sum for coal by the bag, so that the 
buyer of small quantities pays a much higher price for a ton 
bought in this way. The wholesale price of coal has 
increased on an average about 13 per cent since 1900. 

Coke is the solid substance remaining after gas has been 
made from certain kinds of coal, and is sometimes sold by 
gas companies, as a by-product. It is light, and therefore 
easy to handle and does not smoke, but it burns out quickly, 
and the fire of coke requires frequent replenishing. It is 
sold by the bag, or in large quantities by the ton, also some- 
times by the chaldron, an old English measure for coal, 
containing from thirty-two to thirty-six bushels. 

Gas was used for illuminating long before it came into 
common use for heating and cooking. Commercial gas 
manufactured for both lighting and cooking is really a mix- 
ture of various gases. One method produces it from bitu- 
minous coal heated in retorts. Another method gives 
" water gas," by passing steam through heated coal. The 
value of gas will depend upon the components of the mixture, 
and the manufacturer has an opportunity to make ah in- 
ferior gas unless the law stipulates what the quality shall 
be. 

The small town or country dweller may use a gas machine 
on the premises, the gas to be stored or generated in some 
tank in the ground, and piped into the house. Acetylene, 
a compound of carbon and hydrogen, is used in this way. 
Acetylene has a low flashing point, and there is question as to 



36 



FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



its safety. One firm sends a mixed gas of good quality in 
metal bottles to the consumer, the bottles being placed in a 
metal closet above ground outside the house. The firm 
claims that an explosion has never occurred. 

Gas is measured by the cubic foot, and its price estimated 
per 1000 cubic feet. The amount is recorded on a meter as 
the gas passes into the house. See Fig. 13. It is an easy 
matter to learn to read a meter, and every one should do so 




Courtesy of New York Consolidated Gas Co. 
FIG. 13. Reading the gas meter. 

who uses gas. Always compare the gas bill with the amount 
recorded by the meter. If the gas bill becomes larger than 
usual, and you feel sure that the consumption has been nor- 
mal, report the matter to the company. A meter may be 
out of order, and need repair. 

To read the meter. Figure 13 shows the three dials found 
on the face of a gas meter. The arrows show the direction. 
The dial at the right indicates 100 cubic feet between the 
numbers, the middle dial 1000 and the left hand dial 10,000. 
The dials in this figure record 53,250 cubic feet. The price 
of gas varies from eighty cents to a dollar and a half per 
thousand cubic feet. " Eighty-cent gas " is the hope of many 
a consumer. At a dollar and a half it is not a cheap fuel. 



FUEL AND STOVES 37 

Gas does away with the handling of coal and ashes in the 
kitchen and is thus a clean and labor-saving fuel. It gives 
an intense heat the moment the flame is lighted and this heat 
is easily regulated in a well-made stove. The flame should 
burn with a clear blue or greenish color. With a properly 
constructed stove only a small percentage of the heat is lost. 
In all these points it has the advantage over coal. The 
comparative cost is studied in the problems on page 53. 

Natural gas is used in those regions where it occurs, piped 
to the house from a central source. It is found in limited 
areas only, and in some places has already been exhausted. 

Coal oil, or petroleum, sometimes found oozing from crevices 
in rocks, or even floating on water, is a natural inflammable 
oil stored in the earth. It was known in ancient Persia, 
Greece, and Rome, but did not become of great commercial 
importance until the middle of the nineteenth century. It is 
now obtained by boring wells, and is found in great quantities 
in certain regions of the country. The crude oil yields many 
products valuable in the arts, medicine, and manufacture. 
Kerosene is the substance useful as a fuel and for giving 
light. When of good quality it is nearly colorless, and the 
flashing point should be 149 F., or 65 C. This flashing 
point is the temperature at which the vapor from the kero- 
sene explodes or flashes. If the vapor flashes at *a point 
lower than this, it means that the oil has not been suffi- 
ciently refined ; that is, in the process of manufacture the 
substances that flash at a low temperature have not been 
removed, and therefore the oil is less safe. 

Kerosene is sold by the gallon or barrel. The price for a 
good quality is about seventy cents for a five-gallon can. 
By the barrel a saving is made of several cents a gallon. It 
is useful as a fuel to those housekeepers who cannot have 
gas, and who find it a convenient substitute for coal in the

summer. With the new blue flame stoves it gives an intense 
heat, easily regulated. There is no heavy labor involved 
in its use, but even the best stove requires constant care and 
watchfulness. It is not so clean and easy to use as gas. The 
kerosene supply should be kept in a cool place, and stoves 
and lamps should never be filled by candle or lamplight. 

Gasolene is used as a fuel for cooking in some places, but 
in others the fire insurance companies have such strict rules 
in regard to it that its use is practically prohibited. It is 
more volatile than kerosene, and its flashing point is very 
low. Kerosene is much safer for household use. 

Alcohol is used with the chafing dish. Denatured alcohol 
is so cheap in Germany that it is used in large and especially 
adapted stoves for cooking purposes. There are denatured 
alcohol stoves on the market here, but they are little used. 

Charcoal, wood partially burnt out, is little used for do- 
mestic purposes now. 

The relative value of the common fuels is stated in quan- 
tities as follows, but this is of course dependent on the quality 
of the coal and the gas. One thousand feet of gas about 
equals from fifty to sixty pounds of coal, or four and one half 
gallons of kerosene; and one half ton of coal approximates 
a cord of wood. 

Those who may be interested will find a fuller discussion 
of fuels and fuel values in SnelPs " Elementary Household 
Chemistry." 

Electricity is not a fuel, but is classed here as a source of 
heat. It may be supplied for cooking purposes by any com- 
pany that furnishes electric light, and should be available 
in the country wherever an electric trolley runs. The energy 
supplied is measured and paid for by the kilowatt ; that is, 
one thousand watts. The terms used for electrical measure- 
ments cannot be really understood until one has studied 



FUEL AND STOVES 39 

electricity. It may be said, however, that the ampere l is 
the unit of current strength, the volt is the unit of electrical 
pressure or electromotive force, the watt is the unit of elec- 
trical power and the basis of payment for current supplied 
for heating or lighting. 

Voltage, amperage, and watt or kilowatt are the terms 
in common use. If you read the circulars that advertise 
electric cooking apparatus, you will find the request to state 
the voltage of your electric current in ordering a piece of 
apparatus. Or again, the number of watts used per hour is 
given, with the catalogue number and the size of an electric 
stove. 

The cost of electricity per kilowatt (usually from ten to 
fifteen cents) varies in different localities. 

The great advantage of electricity is that little heat is 
lost in radiation, and that the degree of heat is well under 
control. There are also % no products of combustion present, 
and this is the only source of heat for cooking of which this 
is true. Both gas and kerosene vitiate the air to some extent. 

Cooking apparatus. The wastefulness of cooking opera- 
tions, past and present, is due largely to the defects of the 
apparatus used. The open fireplace for wood, and the open 
grate for coal, are two arrangements that permit most of 
the heat to pass up the chimney, and into the room. See 
Frontispiece and Fig. 14. In Fig. 14 there is illustrated at 
the right a brick oven with a flue opening into the chimney. 
This was one of the earliest inventions for saving fuel and 
heat. This oven was lined with brick or stone, and the fire 
of wood was built in it, and allowed to remain until it had

burned out. The coals and ashes were removed, and when 
the brick had cooled somewhat cakes and pies were put in 
to bake. This oven retained its heat for twenty-four hours, 
and beans put in Saturday afternoon were taken out hot for 
the Sunday morning breakfast. The method was clumsy, 
but a good heat saver.

Even the latest types are very wasteful of heat. Stoves 
like that shown in Fig. 19 have been devised for use with 
gas. Even with these only a small percentage of the heat 
generated is available for cooking. 

The ideal system is that which gives the largest possible 
percentage of its heat for cooking, and puts the degree of

and of labor in operating. This does not mean that the

stove which gives the most intense heat is the best, although 
some stoves seem to be constructed with that as the aim. 

Let us consider some of the methods of saving heat, and 
study different kinds of apparatus with this knowledge in mind. 



42 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We recall the fact, first, that some substances are good 
conductors of heat, and others poor. 1 If you hold a metal 
poker in your hand, and place the other end in red hot coals, 
you will realize that metal is a rapid conductor of heat. If 
the poker has a wooden handle, the heat of the coals does 
not readily reach your hand, for the wood is a poor conductor. 
Moreover, this good conductor is a poor holder of heat, the 
heat radiating rapidly from it into the surrounding air, but 
the poor conductor, once thoroughly heated, cools off slowly. 

You can think of many illustrations from your daily life. Why 
do you prefer a woolen blanket on a cool night, rather than a linen 
sheet, merely? Why do you use a cloth holder in ironing? What 
is the principle of a hot water bottle ? Air is a poor conductor. Can 
you think of an illustration of this? What is the principle of a 
thermos bottle ? 

It is not difficult to see how these facts apply in our cooking 
apparatus. From an oven with metal sides heat is lost by 
radiation. In a double oven, with an air space between 
the inner and outer part, some heat is saved. If the outer 
cover is of some non-conducting material, even less radiation 
takes place. This is the principle of the oven devised by 
Mr. Edward Atkinson. Here the inner oven is of sheet 
iron, and the outer covering of a non-conducting material, 
some composition with wood pulp or paper as the basis. If 
in this way heat can be trapped, as it were, in an oven, it 
will follow that less heat will have to be supplied, and we can 
use a smaller amount of fuel. This is the case in the Atkin- 
son oven (Fig. 16), where the source of heat is either a kero- 
sene lamp, or a small Bunsen burner of the rose type, which 
uses only a small amount of gas. 



1 TEACHER'S NOTE. The teacher of physics can cooperate here, and indeed 
throughout the whole topic of apparatus and cooking processes.

Another illustration of the conserving of heat by the pre- 
vention of radiation is in the fireless cooker. This is a method 
used in Sweden in simple form, and adapted and improved 
to suit modern needs. Heat is supplied in the first place by 
gas or kerosene, and the water in the vessel containing the 
food is raised to the boiling point, and held there in some 
cases for a few minutes. The vessel is then placed in the 
" cooker," which is a box with thick walls of some non-con- 
ducting material, and the heat already 
present is sufficient to finish the cook- 
ing process, since the radiation is very 
slow. In some cookers a heated stone 
is introduced to raise the temperature 
slightly. Both of these devices are ex- 
cellent for the long, slow cooking that 
seems to mellow the food material and 
develop the flavors that do not result 
from rapid cooking. 

At the same time, we need rapid pro- 
cesses, such as broiling and toasting, 
which give characteristic flavors. To 
meet this double need, a new type of 
gas stove has been made. See Fig 17. FlG> 16- 

This is a gas stove, where the oven 
has thick walls of a non-conducting material. The oven is 
heated, for a short time only, the gas flame being cut off when 
the oven has reached the desired temperature. At the left 
is an attachment where rapid cooking may be accomplished 
when desired, and there is a device at (1) with the same prin- 
ciple as the fireless cooker, or the tea " cosey." This cover is 
dropped over the kettle when the boiling point is reached, the 
flame is turned out, and the heat in the water finishes the 
process. There is no good reason why stoves embodying

this same principle should not be used with kerosene, and 
with the electric current. Improved stoves of this type will 
be constructed, and certainly will tend toward great economy 
of fuel.

which consists of a series of compartments, one above an-

other, containing several kinds of food, all to be cooked over 
the same burner, either gas or kerosene, or on one section of 
the top of the coal range when space is being used for the 
wash boiler or irons.

lack it cling obstinately to hot fires and violent cooking.

The coal range. Progress is slow, and the coal range 
will not be abolished at present. Figure 18 is an example of 
a good range as easy to manage as possible. The coal box 
at (1) has a lining that prevents the iron from burning out. 
The air enters at (2) and passes out at (3), when the fire is 
first made. When it is necessary to heat the oven, a damper

is closed at (4), and the heated air then passes around the 
oven in the direction of the arrows. The coal is put in at 
(5) and the ashes shaken down at (6). Larger ranges, resting 
upon the floor, have a " dump " for the ashes directly into 
the ash box in the cellar, and some makes have a device for 
operating this with the foot. The coal stove involves the 



46 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

labor of bringing in coal and taking out ashee, and space 
must be given to the coal bin and ash pit. A range of this 
size would serve for a family of five or six. It requires from 
2 to 3 hods per day. A hood should be placed above a large 
range, whether coal or gas. 

To make a coal fire. See that the grate is clean and that the 
ashes have been removed. You know that a current of air con- 
taining oxygen is needed to make the fire burn. How will you 
arrange the damper at (2) and (3) when you are starting the fire? 

Coal does not begin to burn easily. Therefore we kindle it by 
materials that have a low kindling temperature, light wood, paper, 
and matches. 

In the bottom of the grate, lay twisted pieces of paper, or very 
finely split pieces of wood, or shavings, next in order larger pieces 
of wood laid " crisscross," yet close enough not to let the coal fall 
through, and on the top a shovelful or two of coal. Why do you 
not put in flat newspapers, and lay the kindling lengthwise and 
solid? Put on the stove lids, arrange the dampers properly, and 
touch the match. Why do you use the match? Why does the 
match light? Perhaps your nature study lessons will help you to 
explain this whole kindling process. 

What should be the next step in the fire making? How should 
you finally arrange the dampers? 

A coal fire will keep well for a considerable length of time, if the 
coal is put on and the ash removed regularly, provided the stove is 
well constructed, and the coal of good quality. Add fresh coal 
before the fire becomes a dull red, and shows ashes. If it gets too 
low, wood kindling will be needed, and this is poor management. 
Be careful not to put in so much coal that you cannot put the lid 
on firmly. It ruins the top of a stove if the hot coals touch it. 

Soot must be removed once in a while from the top and bottom 
of the oven, and from the stove pipe.

FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 






The gas burner (Fig. 20) is constructed on the principle 
of the Bunsen burner, which you may have used in the labora- 
tory. There is an opening in the pipe, near the stopcock, 
which admits the air, that it may mix with the gas, and give 
the blue flame. If there is not enough air, the flame burns 
with a yellow color, and smokes. If there is too much air, 
there is a roaring sound, and the flame " pulls back " and 
burns with a smoky yellow flame, and disagreeable odor. 

There is a valve always to reg- 
ulate the air supply for each 
burner. Figure 20 shows a 
burner removed from the range, 
(1) is the hollow, star-shaped 
chamber which gives space for 
the thorough mixing of the gas 
with the air. The gas enters 
from the connecting pipe at 
(2), the air at (3), and (4) is 
the valve for regulating the 
air supply. 

Gas ranges of this type are built in different sizes, and 
with varying arrangements of ovens and hot-closets. An 
oven above the stove is convenient. Ranges are built also 
for using either gas or coal. A range of the size pictured, 
with four large burners on the top, will serve for a family of 
five or six, if the work is well planned. The oven burner 
consumes 30 to 40 cubic feet per hour, the top burners 
2 cubic feet each, and the simmering burner somewhat 
less. This is estimated for a burner turned on full. 

To manage a gas stove. Before lighting the top or oven burners 
see that the stopcocks are all tight, with no escaping gas. To 
light the top burners, strike the match, turn on the stopcock, and 
touch the match to the gas when it is flowing well. A disagreeable

FUEL AND STOVES 49 

" popping " follows if the match is applied to the burner before 
the gas flows. For lighting the oven, a " leader " burner at the 
side of the stove acts as a taper. Open the oven doors, and the 
door below, strike the match, turn on the leader, and light it, turn 
on the back burner, and then the front burner, and turn out the 
leader. The so-called explosion of a gas stove is due to the sudden 
lighting of a quantity of gas under the oven that has collected with- 
out being lighted. 

The important point in managing a gas stove is to keep the stop- 
cock turned so that the flame is low. The full flame is needed only 
when water is being brought to the boiling point, and for the first 
heating of the oven. The low flame should be protected from 
draft. Many gas stoves now have a small simmering burner 
that is more useful than the large burner. Another point in the 
use of the stove is the prevention of the " boiling over " from some 
kettle. The low flame helps here, and it is also necessary that the 
kettles should not be too full. " Boiling over " clogs the burners, 
and makes necessary the frequent cleaning of the pan underneath 
the burners. 

The oven burner should be lighted from five to ten minutes be- 
fore the oven is wanted, depending upon the intensity of the flames. 
After the food has been put in the oven, allow a few minutes, not 
more than five, for the food to heat through, and then turn the 
flame as low as possible. Often, one burner can be turned out. 
This you have to learn by experience. When toasting or broiling 
is the process, light the oven burner before using, because the work 
is performed by the heated iron as well as by the gas flame. Leave 
the lower door open, as bread toasts or meat broils, to hasten the 
browning process, for it is the oxygen of the air that causes the 
browning. Some coal ovens have a damper for admitting air for 
this same purpose and though some flavor is lost in this way by 
evaporation, the amount is negligible in a quick cooking process. 
The Atkinson oven is so tightly closed, that food does not acquire 
a rich brown in it. An opening at the top is available when a deli- 
cate brown is wanted. It is true, however, that the slow process 
with a minimum of evaporation gives a flavor that compensates for 
the brown color and flavor. All burners should be removed if 
the holes seem clogged and be boiled out in a solution of washing 
soda, two tablespoonfuls to a gallon of water. Do not blacken the 
burners. 



50 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Kerosene stoves. The best type is a blue-flame stove 
with a wick. Kerosene stoves are made with no wick, the 
kerosene being vaporized just before it reaches the burner, 
but such a stove requires occasional pumping to force the 
kerosene into the vaporizing chamber, and on the whole is 
less satisfactory than the stove with the wick. The heat is 
intense from this blue flame, and the burner is economical of 
the fuel. The small kerosene stoves, burning with a yellow 
flame are always inclined to smoke, and difficult to keep 
clean. A three- or four-burner oil stove with a portable oven 
will do the cooking in summer for a family of five or six. 
One burner consumes a gallon of oil in 15 hours. Portable 
double ovens are furnished with such stoves. 

The kerosene stove is cheaper to operate than a gas range, 
even with kerosene at fourteen cents a gallon, but the heat 
is not under such perfect control, and the stove requires more 
work to keep it clean. 

The one important point in the management of this blue-flame 
wick stove is to keep the flame down by having the wick low, and 
where it belongs. The cylinder around the burner prevents the 
escape of heat and carries it to the utensil above. A careless 
person, by raising the wick too high, and producing a yellow smoky 
flame, makes much trouble for herself. It is important to fill the 
tank without spilling a drop of kerosene, and to keep every part 
of the stove well washed off with soap and water. The wick should 
be rubbed off occasionally, never cut, and if an odor becomes per- 
ceptible, the burner should be taken apart and boiled in a solution 
of washing soda and water. The wick will need to be renewed at 
intervals, depending upon the amount of use that it has. With 
care a stove of this kind is clean and odorless.

for cooking by electricity, each piece of apparatus having its

may stand, and which is therefore available for more than 
one purpose. 

The advantages of electric cooking are obvious. The heat 
is directly conducted to each utensil, and a minimum amount 
is lost in radiation. The degree of heat is perfectly under 
control, and the manipulation is nothing more than the 
turning of a knob. When the apparatus is installed, it is 
adjusted to the voltage, so that no further regulation is

necessary. There are no waste products, and no matches to 
light or throw away. If the wiring is properly done, there is 
no danger from fire. The one present disadvantage is the 
cost. Each piece of apparatus is expensive. The cost of 
running must depend upon the cost of electricity in the neigh- 
borhood, and the number of watts per hour used by each 
piece of apparatus. The larger the utensil, the more watts 
consumed. The disk stove in Fig. 22 uses 250 watts ; a disk

ter, 475 watts; of

one has learned to use the oven, they are not really accurate

thermometer inserted, protected by asbestos and metal.

CHAPTER IV 

FOOD PREPARATION, THE PRINCIPLES AND 
TECHNIQUE 

The principles of cooking. In science the word " prin- 
ciple " ordinarily means a formulation of some general or 
constant mode of behavior a generalization based on many 
observations of fact. In cookery the word is used in the 
same sense ; for example, one may say that an important 
principle to bear in mind when cooking with any fat is that 
the fats may be melted without decomposition, but when too 
strongly heated they begin to decompose with the production 
of acrid and irritating products. Sometimes, however, we 
speak of " principles of cookery " in a broader and some- 
what less exact sense to indicate the general purposes of 
cooking operations, as when we say that the most important 
principle of vegetable cookery is to soften the fiber without 
destroying the flavor or dissolving away the ash constituents 
of the vegetable. 

That is, the change either chemical or physical that takes 
place in a certain foodstuff by the application of heat or 
cold or by the use of a fermentation process may be referred 
to as the underlying, working principle. We shall study in 
detail these changes as we experiment with and prepare each 
food material, but a general statement of the effect of heat 
on various foodstuffs will be helpful here. 

Protein. There are several forms of protein, with dif- 
ferences that we can understand only after a thorough study 
of chemistry. The most important proteins in meat, fish, 

54 



FOOD PREPARATION 55 

eggs, milk, old beans and peas coagulate, or become slightly 
harder or firmer at a temperature below the boiling point of 
water. We shall perform an experiment to show this while 
studying the egg. There is no marked chemical change ; 
that is, the protein is not changed to another substance. 

Fats. Solid fats are liquefied by heat, and freed from the 
tissue that contains them in animal fats like suet. 

When a fat begins to smoke with heat, a chemical change is 
taking place. If intense heat is continued, all the hydrogen 
and oxygen are driven off and pure carbon remains. When 
the fat is " brown," giving the flavor we like, a part of the 
oxygen and hydrogen have been driven off. The " boiling " 
of fat in a kettle is ordinarily due to the boiling of the water 
contained in the fat. 

Starch. Starch occurs in the form of granules. See 
Fig. 39. In boiling water, the granule expands and finally 
bursts, and frees the content, the pure starch, and the whole 
mass thickens. 

Boiled with an acid the starch is changed to dextrin, a sub- 
stance resembling a gum, and the mixture becomes thin; 
and this process continued changes the dextrin to dextrose. 

With intense " dry " heat, as in toasting, the granule 
expands and opens, and the contents change to % dextrin. 
Continued heat reduces the starch to pure carbon. The 
brown color and pleasant flavor in toast are a stage on the 
road to carbon. 

Sugar. Sugar first melts with heat, then begins to de- 
compose, giving off water. This is also a stage on the road 
to pure carbon. Caramel, a familiar flavor, is sugar in the 
brown stage, with the water partly driven off. 

The art in applying intense heat to fat, starch, and sugar 
is to know the stopping point, to reach the " brown taste " 
and stop short of the " burnt taste." 



56 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Mineral matter. The " ash " remains for the most part 
unchanged by heat, but may be lost in the water in which 
vegetables and meat are cooked if the water is thrown 
away. 

Vegetable fiber is softened by heat and moisture, and the 
protein, starch, fat, and sugar are freed, making them avail- 
able for our digestion and nutrition. 

Meat fiber softens at a low temperature, that is, below the 
boiling point of water, with moisture; continued intense 
heat shrinks and hardens it. A tender steak fried with fat 
in a hot pan will soon resemble sole leather. 

The technique of food preparation. From the moment 
the food materials enter the kitchen until the unusable 
portions are destroyed or carried away, there is a best way 
of working with them at each step, and the sum of these may 
be said to make a good technique. This technique will 
include cleanliness first and foremost, then skill in the use of 
tools, judgment in managing cooking apparatus and in ap- 
plying heat in cooking processes, and accuracy and rapidity 
of execution. It will also include or add to itself the aesthetic 
element, the fine art of flavoring, the dainty garnishing of a 
dish. Moreover, this technique is the method of putting 
into practice some basic, scientific principle. To illustrate : 

The principle that underlies toast-making is threefold, 

Heat evaporates moisture throughout the slice of bread. 

Intense heat changes the content of the starch granules on the 
surface of the slice of bread to dextrin. 

Intense heat, long continued, will change first the surface starch, 
and then all, to carbon (charcoal). 

A good technique will secure the first two, and avoid the third and 
includes, 

The selection of bread already partially dry. 

The cutting of bread into slices of uniform thickness. 

Regulating the source of heat. 



FOOD PREPARATION 57 

Placing the slices firmly in a toaster, or on a fork, or evenly on a 
rack when toasting by gas. 

Keeping the toast at a distance from the source of heat that in- 
sures a steady but not too rapid change. 

Turning the toaster or the slices to cook each surface in turn 
and thus to make the process slower. 

Stopping the process before carbon is formed and the toast 
" burned." (A good technique does not include scraping the toast !) 

The cesthetic element in toast-making might be a pretty shape 
of the slices, say triangular pieces, and a dainty arrangement. In 
this case and in others it is true that the result of a good technique 
is aesthetic, in that correct manipulation while securing the desired 
chemical change also develops the pleasing golden brown that 
makes the toast so attractive. 

The care of food materials. When food materials are 
delivered, have receptacles ready for each kind of food. (See 
kitchen furnishing.) Attend first to perishable foods. 
Wash and dry milk and cream bottles before putting them in 
the refrigerator. Treat eggs in the same way. This is also 
a good plan with lemons and other skin fruit, unless the 
quantity is too large, in which case they should not be put 
into the refrigerator. Remove wrappings from meat, 
poultry, and fish; wipe them with a soft cloth, dipped in 
salt and water, dry them, and place them in the ice box. 
Wash the cloth thoroughly and dry it. Fish should be 
covered that its odor may not affect other food. Vegetables 
like lettuce, celery, and spinach should be washed and 
picked over immediately, and the poor portions thrown away. 
All semi-perishable foods should be put in a cool, dry place, 
and the non-perishables in their separate receptacles. (See 
page 20.) Do not keep anything in brown paper bags, but 
save these bags for other uses. 

Have a regular time for inspecting and for cleaning all the 
places and receptacles where food is kept. Do not allow any 
spilled food material to remain anywhere, and do not tolerate

the presence of any material, cooked or uncooked, that shows 
the least taint. A keen sense of smell is a good servant here. 

The processes of food preparation. With kitchen in 
order, tools ready, and food materials at hand, we are ready 
for the actual food preparation. A distinction is to be 
made between cookery and cooking. Cookery includes 
all the steps necessary to produce the finished product, 
while cooking is the actual application of heat, only one 
step of the whole process, though, indeed, one of the most 
important and difficult. The order of procedure in food 
preparation is as .follows : 

See first that the stove is ready (Chapter IV). Then 
comes the choice and study of the recipe or the method of 
cooking. The word " recipe " is from a Latin word meaning 
" take." Follow this advice and " take " or bring together 
on the work table whatever materials are needed. Decide 
upon the necessary utensils, and place them conveniently 
near. As you gather the materials together you will measure 
and weigh the exact amounts. Do this before you begin 
the putting together or mixing. Sometimes instead of mixing, 
the necessary process is paring, or scraping, or cutting, each 
with its own best way. Then follows the application of 
heat. Some foods are then served at once, others must be 
carefully put away after cooling. Or again, there is no ap- 
plication of heat, for instance, when the freezing temperature 
is used in ice cream ; or in a salad, or fruit preparation where 
cooling in the refrigerator is the next step. The technique 
of preparing a meal and serving will be found in Chapter XVI. 

How to study a recipe. Remember that a recipe is a 
bit of experience handed down for us to make useful. Some 
one experimented at some time long ago, perhaps failed at 
first, tried again, finally succeeded, and passed on the result 
by word of mouth to others. There were doubtless good 



FOOD PREPARATION 59 

cooks long before there were printed or written recipes. Some 
recipes, however, have been handed down from Roman times, 
and recipes were printed as early as the sixteenth century. 
Modern recipes are much more accurate than the old, as 
you may see if you have opportunity to read some old cook 
book. 

At first in using a recipe follow its directions exactly. 
Notice the proportions, and read carefully the directions for 
combining the ingredients, noting those points that are 
most important. Have the whole process well in mind before 
you begin work. Do not let it be necessary to refer to the 
printed page at every move you make. This is poor 
technique. 

When the use of a recipe is preceded by some simple ex- 
periment that makes the basic principle clear, it is much 
easier to use the recipe with intelligence. 

When you are no longer a novice you may take liberties 
with a recipe, even a new one, scanning it with a critical eye, 
and perhaps giving it a cool welcome. It may not be new 
at all ! For this is the secret of recipes, there are really 
only a few, and the key to their use is the recognition of the 
old in the new garb, and the having of a few type recipes 
clearly in mind. Each kind of prepared dish has one, or 
two, or three basic forms or mixtures. Learn these, and then 
with experience you will become inventive, and make your 
own variations. For example, there are but two kinds of 
cake, those made with butter (or other fat) and those 
without butter (the sponge cake). You will not attempt to 
memorize many recipes, but you will find that in studying 
these type recipes you have learned a few proportions so well 
that you cannot forget them. When you have reached this 
stage of freedom you will still do exact work, but your in- 
genuity and taste wi]^ have free play and you will not be 



60 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

tied to other people's recipes. But you cannot well begin 
at this end. 

Make some plan for recording new recipes that you test 
and find good. It may be a printed recipe, or one that a 
friend gives you. The most convenient plan is a recipe box 
or card file. The guide cards are arranged alphabetically, 
and each recipe is either pasted upon a card or written 
upon it. This plan makes it easy to discard an old recipe, 
or one that has proved unsatisfactory, and to keep new 
recipes in alphabetical order, which cannot be done in a book. 
A loose leaf book is made for recipes, alphabetized at the side, 
with envelopes for holding cuttings that may be fastened in 
between the pages. This is a little less easy to use than 
the card file. 

Weighing and measuring. The system is " Avoir- 
dupois," sixteen ounces to the pound. Learn to read the 
scales exactly, and when weighing, always allow for the 
weight of the utensil or paper holding the food. Weighing 
is more accurate than measuring, but it is slower, and the 
measuring can be made sufficiently accurate for most daily 
work. Weighing is necessary in the cookery of large pieces 
of meat and with poultry in order to estimate correctly the 
time for cooking; and it is more convenient to weigh than 
measure when preserving fruit if the quantities are large. 
Also in studying food values it is usually necessary to weigh 
the articles of food. 

The measures in common use are the saltspoon, teaspoon, and 
tablespoon, the half-pint measuring cup, the pint, quart, and 
gallon of liquid measure. The saltspoon is not accurate, and 
it is better to use some fraction of a teaspoonful. Teaspoons 
and tablespoons of a standard volume may be found at some fur- 
nishing shops. The spoons in common use vary in size, and the 
only way to approximate accuracy is to use the level spoonful. 



FOOD PREPARATION 61 

This is now the common practice. Tin and glass half-pint 
cups are made gauged in quarters and thirds. Those 
commonly on sale sometimes measure more than one fourth 
of the standard quart. Inquire when you buy if the cup 
measure is standard, that is, exactly one half standard 
pint. A quart measure, with four divisions, is necessary 
for careful work. A pint measure is convenient, but not 
necessary if you have the quart and half-pint measuring cup. 

It is necessary to know the relation of these different 
weights and measures to each other. While you may find 
tables of relative weight and measures in many cookbooks, 
it is much better for you to work out a few of the most useful 
for yourself, making careful record in your notebooks. 

The following abbreviations are short cuts in reading and 
writing. 



oz. = ounce 
Ib. = pound 
ssp. = saltspoonful 
tsp. = teaspoonful 
tbsp. = tablespoonful 



cp. = cup 

pt. = pint 

qt. = quart 

gall. = gallon 



If you wish something quicker even than this for note- 
book work, you can use, 



t = teaspoonful 
T = tablespoonful 
C = cup 



P = pint 
Q = quart 
G = gallon 



Experiments in weighing and measuring. 1 

Answer these questions by performing the experiments. Record 
in notebook in orderly form. . 



1 TEACHER'S NOTE. These experiments may be performed as each food 
material is used. In this case a page should be kept in the notebook for 
the table of weights and measures, and each observation recorded as it is 
made. It may be that the perishable articles will not be on hand, except 
as they are used in order. The weighing and measuring should be dwelt 
on all through the course. 



62 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Apparatus. Standard scales, a quart measure, and for each pu- 
pil a measuring cup, table knife, teaspoon, and tablespoon. 
Materials. Those mentioned below. 

1. How many eggs (medium size) to 1 lb.? 

2. What is the weight of one egg? 

3. Of one pint of flour? 

4. Of one cup of flour? 

5. Of one cup of granulated sugar? 

6. Of one cup of powdered sugar ? 

7. Of one pint of milk? 

8. Average the weight of six potatoes. 

9. How many level teaspoonf uls of flour to a level tablespoonf ul ? 

10. How many teaspoonf uls of water to a tablespoonf ul ? 

11. How many tablespoonf uls of flour to a cup? 

12. How many tablespoonfuls of water to a cup ? 

(These relative measures are convenient for dividing recipes.) 

13. Measure a level tablespoonf ul of flour, by filling the spoon, 
holding it level, and leveling the flour by running the back of the 
knife quickly from the base of the bowl of the spoon to the tip. 

How can you most accurately divide this in halves ? In quar- 
ters? 

14. How much does a cup of flaked cereal weigh ? 

15. How much does a cup of granular cereal weigh? 

16. Butter is hard to measure in a cup. If a recipe calls for | 
cup butter, it is easier to measure it by tablespoonfuls. Find out 
how many make cup. 

17. How much does a cup of butter weigh? If you know this, 
you can weigh it, instead of measuring, or if your butter is in pound 
" pats," you will be able to cut off a cupful, instead of weighing it. 

18. An old-fashioned recipe for sponge cake reads thus : Take 
the weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour. Trans- 
late this into measures. 

Preparing and mixing. Food materials that are not to 
be mixed with others still need special preparation before 
heat is applied. 

For fruits and vegetables, washing is the first stage, followed by 
scraping, paring, peeling, cutting, or slicing. Meats, poultry, and 



FOOD PREPARATION 63 

fish must be cleaned by wiping, and cut and trimmed with a sharp 
knife. 

Cooked meats and fish and vegetables may be chopped or sliced. 

Cooked vegetables are also mashed and beaten. 

Cream is whipped or beaten, and eggs served raw likewise. 

These seem simple processes, but each one needs a good tool and 
a knack in the muscles. Each method will be taken up m detail, 
with each food material. 

Methods of mixing are important, where several ingredients 
are combined. We seek for a way that will give the most 
complete mingling of all the substances with smoothness 
and lightness, at the same time saving time and strength. 
We must look always for the " short cut." It is necessary 
to have the texture of the food such that it can be well 
masticated and mixed with the digestive fluids, but time is 
too precious to spend hours on a dessert, or in beating 
biscuits. 

Sifting, or putting materials through a fine mesh, is used to lighten 
flour that has been packed down, to remove coarse portions, or to 
mix thoroughly several dry ingredients. 

Stirring is done with a spoon, and is a round and round motion, 
used for mixing a liquid and a dry ingredient. 

Rubbing is used for combining a dry ingredient with a semi-solid 
substance like butter. Creaming is a term used for the rubbing of 
butter until it becomes soft and creamy. A spoon should be used, 
not the hand. 

" Cutting in " with a knife is used for combining butter with 
flour in biscuit and pastry where the butter should not be softened. 

Beating with a spoon, or beater of the spoon type, is a free over 
and over motion, the spoon being lifted from the mixture for the 
backward stroke. This is used for increasing the smoothness of 
the mixture after the first stirring, and for beating in air. It needs 
a strong free motion of the forearm. Beating is also accomplished 
by the rotary motion of a mechanical beater like the Dover. 

Cutting and folding is the delicate process of mixing lightly beaten 
egg with a liquid or semi-liquid without losing out the air. The 



64 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

spoon is cut in, sidewise, a rotary motion carries it down and up 
again, and it folds in the beaten egg as it goes. 

Kneading is a motion used with dough, and is a combination of 
a rocking and pressing motion, .accomplished by the hands. A 
good result can be obtained by some bread machines, and this is the 
cleaner method. 

Rolling out is just what the term denotes, a rolling of a thick piece 
of dough by means of a cylindrical wooden " pin " to the thickness 
proper for cookies and crusts. Dry bread is also rolled to break 
it into fine crumbs. 

Pounding and grinding are usually accomplished for us now in 
factories in breaking of spices and coffee. It is better to have a 
coffee mill at home. 

The order of mixing is important in its effect in batters and doughs 
and is discussed in that chapter. 

Cooking processes. For the beginnings of cooking we 
should need to go back to the days when game was roasted 
by the open fire, built for warmth, or corn parched on hot 
stones. Perhaps some root was cooked in the hot ashes. 
This primitive method of roasting we still use in camp fires, 
and in modified form wherever food is directly exposed to 
the heat of coal or gas. Water could not be a cooking 
medium until man advanced at least to the first stage of 
pottery making, when some rude basket daubed with clay 
was water-tight and sufficiently heat proof. 

Application of heat is the most difficult stage of the whole 
process of cookery. It is so easy to have the heat too intense, 
or too low, to expose the food for too long or too short a time 
to its action. Most of our apparatus fails to give us a uni- 
form heat, the tendency being to an increase or decrease 
of temperature. Since the boiling temperature of water re- 
'mains at 212 F., boiling is an easy process to manage, pro- 
vided the water does not boil out. The presence of water 
insures a low or moderate temperature always. 

It requires patience and time to learn how to bring this 



FOOD PREPARATION 65 

natural force of heat under control. One novice who had 
allowed a flour paste to boil over and burn while she was 
looking out of the window remarked : " We may forget, 
but they never do ! " a pretty way of stating the steady 
working of nature's forces which we can harness for our use 
only by the exercise of reason and will and constant watch- 
fulness. The unintelligent cook is impatient of slow pro- 
cesses, and cannot believe that food will finally be " done " 
unless the water is at a " galloping " boil, and a red-hot fire 
is keeping the oven at burning temperature. 

Look upon the application of heat as a continuation of 
nature's slow ripening process, a softening of tough fibers 
and a development of pleasing flavors. For why do we cook 
at all except for these reasons ? Primitive man thought only 
that the food had a better taste. He may have decided, too, 
that it was easier to masticate; but we have learned that 
in some cases we may, with right methods of cooking, make it 
easier to digest farther on in the alimentary canal. Modern 
science carries us a step farther and teaches us that cooking 
destroys lower organisms, such as harmful bacteria that may 
be present, and even animal parasites in meats. 

We cook, therefore, to improve the appearance of food, to 
develop flavors, to render some foodstuffs more digestible and to 
destroy microorganisms. 

We have at our command the following processes : 
Heat direct from coal, charcoal, wood, or gas. 

Toasting. Surfaces of food exposed and turned for browning. 

Broiling. Thin portions of meat or fish exposed and turned for 
searing, browning, and short cooking of the interior. 

Roasting. Thicker cuts of meat exposed and turned frequently 
for searing, browning, and gradual cooking of the interior. This 
is an ancient method. It survives in the French " Rotisserie " ; 
and we use it in the modern gas stove when we cook directly under 
the gas. 



66 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Heat through an intervening medium. 
Water, the medium. 

Boiling. Cooking in boiling water, temperature, 212 F., or 
100 C. 

Simmering, stewing, or " coddling." Cooking in water below 
the boiling temperature, 180 F. up to 210 F. < 

Steaming. Cooking in a receptacle into which steam pene- 
trates, 212 F. or in a closed receptacle surrounded by steam or 
boiling water as in a double boiler, O A ~ a " steatner," temperature 
from 200 F. to 210 F. 
Fat, the medium. 

Deep fat frying, temperature 350-400 F. 
Heated surfaces, the medium. 

Pan broiling Cooking of chops or steaks in a heated pan, with- 
out additional fat. 

Saute. To cook in a heated pan with a small amount of fat, 
enough merely to prevent the food from sticking to the pan and to 
hasten the browning process. " Baking " cakes on a griddle is a 
modification of this method. 

Baking. Cooking in a heated oven, temperature from 300 F. to 
450 F., or higher for rapid browning. Meat and poultry cooked 
in an oven are baked and not roasted, although we use the word 
" roast " for this method. 

Braising. Cooking meat in a heated oven in a closed vessel, 
with a supply of water to keep down the temperature. This might 
be called an " oven stew." 

These methods are sometimes combined in one process. In 
a brown stew, the meat is first cooked in a pan with a little fat to 
brown it, and to sear the outside for retaining the juices, before the 
actual stewing begins. A " pot-roast," is an old-fashioned method 
of cooking a solid piece of meat with a little water in a pot on top 
of the stove. The water simmers out, and the meat is browned. 
What methods does this process unite? 

The American Indians in their Squantum, or Clam Bake, heated 
a layer of stones by means of a fire on top, removing the ashes 
when the fire died down. A layer of wet seaweed was placed on the 
stones, and upon this clams, fish, and corn were laid, and covered 
with another layer of seaweed. We have inherited this method from 
the Indians, and use it at the shore. What is the cooking process ? 



FOOD PREPARATION 67 

Care of food after cooking. Bread, cake, cookies, and 
pastry should be cooled on a rack, or spread out in such a 
way that they do not steam. They should then be placed 
in a tin box or stone jar, which has been cleaned by washing 
and scalding with boiling water, and thoroughly dried. 
This process destroys any mold that might be lurking about. 
Keep paraffin paper on hand to cover this class of food in 
its box or jar. This will prevent too rapid drying out. Do 
not use cloth. It flavors the bread or cake, no matter how 
clean it may be. 

All food that is to be served cold or reheated should be 
cooled before placing in the ice box. For what reason? 
Cool by placing in a draught, or set the vessel containing 
the food in running cold water from the faucet. It is par- 
ticularly important to cool soups and broths rapidly. Which 
of these methods will you use, as being the more rapid ? 

All meat that is to be served cold should be cooled, es- 
pecially if it is rare, or underdone. How will you accomplish 
this? 

Care of left overs. This is one of the tests of food manage- 
ment. It is so easy at the end of a meal either to throw 
food away, or set it into the refrigerator on the dish in which 
it has been served. Have a good supply of cheap bowls, 
plates, and saucers to hold left overs in the refrigerator, thus 
avoiding one possibility for breakage of the table china. 

Keep slices of bread for toasting, pieces of bread, to dry for crumbs, 
with special receptacles for each. Return pieces of cake to the cake 
box. Muffins may be reheated. Toast may be kept to serve under 
eggs or meat. 

All butter should be saved. Pieces left on butter plates if clean 
should be scraped into a wide-mouthed jar and kept for cooking. 

Pieces of meat should be kept for reheating or " made " dishes, 
stews or soups or for salads. In hot weather, let your first order 
of meat be small, and dispose of left overs as rapidly as possible. 



68 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Vegetables may be reheated, or used for flavoring soups and stews, 
or used cold in salads. 

Desserts and fruits may be used for a " pick up " luncheon. 

Salads do not keep their freshness and flavor well, and should 
be used very soon. 

Milk and cream should be returned to proper receptacles in the 
refrigerator as soon as possible. 

Disposal of waste food. This is the final test of good 
housekeeping, and many otherwise good housekeepers fail 
just here. Even at its best the garbage pail is not altogether 
a pleasing object, and at its worst it is unspeakable. It 
must not be ignored. 

Have a system adapted to your own kitchen, and the 
municipal method of disposal, if there is such. 

Use a covered pail of enamel ware, rather than one of galvanized 
iron. The surface of the enamel is smooth, and therefore easier 
to wash, and there is no excuse for putting off the cleansing of the 
pail. Wash, rinse, and dry the pail and the cover immediately after it 
is emptied. Do not put a piece of paper in the bottom of the pail. 
This request is made by the department in New York City, and it is 
always better not to mix food waste and paper waste. If you live in 
an apartment house, your name should be painted on the pail. 

Never put liquid into the garbage pail with solid refuse. Strain 
out whatever liquid may be left in coffee or tea, and pour it into the 
sink drain. . If there is a greasy liquid to throw away, add to it a 
teaspoonful or more of washing powder, and let it stand a time. If 
you have used enough of the powder, you will find that you have a 
soapy liquid to pour down the sink. 

Coffee, tea, cocoa, or lemonade left in cups should be diluted 
and poured down the sink and never into the garbage pail. 

Empty garbage at evening when possible, to prevent the long 
standing through the night. Keep the pail closely covered both 
day. and night, to keep out flies, and water bugs, if they are about. 
Allow the pail to stand outside the kitchen unless the fire escape is 
the only accessible out-of-doors. Remember that the fire escape 
is not a back porch, and that you would be fined for using it as such 
if the inspectors were efficient. 



FOOD PREPARATION 69 

There are two classes of waste : uncooked refuse, like 
potato skins, egg shells, pea pods, meat trimmings and 
bones ; and table scraps from plates. 

Pieces of fat may be " tried out," but do not accumulate more 
than you use. A few egg shells may be kept for settling coffee, 
but again do not keep too many. 

The country dweller has a simple problem. What the farm ani- 
mals do not eat will serve as fertilizer for plant life. After the bones 
have been picked, keep them together, in some receptacle, and 
finally bury or burn them. Have a compost heap properly covered 
where the uneaten fragments will decompose and make fertilizer, 
or bury them at once if preferred. "V . 

The city dweller who uses a coal stove is able to burn some refuse. 
Strain out whatever liquid is present, dry the refuse under the 
grate, and put it- into a hot fire. Do not crowd damp refuse into 
the fire box when the fire is low, for it will smoulder, and this heavy 
smoke will eventually clog the flues. The odor of this smoke, too, 
is disagreeable in the neighborhood. A garbage drier, set into the 
stove pipe, has been devised, but the simpler plan of drying the refuse 
under the grate is quite as satisfactory. 

Where gas or kerosene is the fuel, or where electricity is used, the 
garbage pail is the only resort, unless one'iives in a building equipped 
with a special stove or " garbage burner " for the disposal of waste.

CHAPTER V 
WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 

ALTHOUGH water does not supply energy to the body, it 
plays an important part in nutrition. As building material, 
it constitutes about two thirds of the body weight, and as a 
regulator of' body processes it serves as a solvent and carrier 
of nutritive material and waste, keeps the blood and digestive 
fluids of proper concentration, and helps to regulate the 
temperature of the body. It is contained in nearly all food 
materials and is the basis of all beverages. 

Water as a beverage. Water is being given off all the 
time from the body through the lungs, skin, and kidneys. 
The exact .amount depends partly upon atmospheric con- 
ditions and the amount of exercise, which affect the loss 
through the lungs and skin, and partly on the amount taken 
in, for water passes through the body rather quickly. We 
can endure lack of food for weeks, but can exist only a few 
days without water. 

A drink of water taken the first thing in the morning tends 
to clean out the digestive tract and put one in good condition 
for breakfast. Water with meals aids digestion, provided 
it is not used to wash down food but is taken when the 
mouth is empty. It should not be extremely cold nor hot. 
Two glasses at a single meal are usually all that are desirable. 
When there is much water in the food, as in soups, milk, 
fruits, and some vegetables, or when other beverages are 
taken, less will be taken as plain water. When one feels 

70 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 71 

hungry and uncomfortable between meals a drink of water 
will often relieve the sensation. 

Water is either soft or hard. Rain water is perfectly soft, 
but as it passes through the earth after falling, it sometimes 
becomes laden with mineral substances, that affect its cleans- 
ing properties, and that may affect its physiological action. 
Such water is called hard. 

Temporary hardness is caused by a soluble lime compound 
which is precipitated by boiling. If the teakettle is in- 
crusted inside by a layer of lime, the hardness is of this 
character. Such water should be boiled and cooled for 
drinking. Permanent hardness is due to other compounds of 
lime and magnesia which are not precipitated by boiling, 
but which can be -counteracted for cleansing purposes by the 
addition of some substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. 
If the excess of salts has some undesirable physiological 
effect, this water should be distilled, or bottled water for 
drinking brought from ejsewhere. 

Of much greater importance is the question of the freedom 
of the water supply from harmful bacteria and organic matter. 
Never use a well without having the water tested by an 
expert. This will sometimes be done by the local or state 
Board of Health or Experiment Station. All water sources 
should be guarded from contamination. (See " Shelter and 
Clothing," Chapter V.) Filters may be used, and are effective 
in straining out sediment, but the home filter is seldom to be 
relied upon to remove actual bacterial contamination. If used 
at all, the filter should be frequently cleaned and sterilized in 
boiling water. In case the supply is suspected, the water for 
drinking should be boiled for at least ten minutes, allowed to 
settle, if necessary, and poured off into bottles for cooling. This 
is a practice to be commended after a heavy rainfall, and espe- 
cially in the autumn. These bottles may be placed on the ice. 



72 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Ice must be used with caution always in drinking water, 
and it is the safer way to cool the water beside the ice. The 
freezing of water in pond and river does not purify or sterilize 
it. Natural ice is usually questionable. Artificial ice, if 
properly manufactured, is much safer. 

Always have a supply of water in covered pitcher or water 
bottle, with clean glasses at hand, where it may be taken 
freely when wanted. Remember that the individual cup or 
glass is an absolute necessity. The dipper or glass in common 
must not be countenanced. In a large family of many chil- 
dren it would save labor to use paper cups between meals. 

Water should be swallowed slowly, and ice-cold water 
should not be taken when one is overheated. When one is 
overthirsty, control must be exercised in regard to quantity 
and rapidity of drinking. 

Water in cooking. Water is necessary to the softening 
of fiber, and the cooking of starch. It acts as a solvent for 
sugar and salt and for gelatin, an/1 is the basis of meat soups, 
certain substances in the meat dissolving in the water. The 
flavors of tea and coffee are extracted by water. 

As a medium in cooking it supplies heat in the steaming, 
boiling, and stewing processes, and in the form of melting ice 
with salt it acts as a freezing medium. 

It is not necessary to lift the cover of a kettle to see if the 
water boils, if one is familiar with the action of water nearing 
and at the boiling point. A simple experiment with the 
boiling of water in a Florence flask is always interesting, and 
from it one gains practical knowledge. 

Experiments with the boiling temperature of water. 

A. Apparatus: A ring stand, a Florence flask, a square of wire 

net, a chemical thermometer, a Bunsen burner. 
Method: Place the Florence flask, half full of water, on the 

square of wire net upon the large ring of the ring stand 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 73 

over the Bunsen burner. Put the chemical thermometer 
in the Florence flask, clamping it in such a way that the 
bulb is covered by the water and yet does not touch the 
bottom of the flask. 
Make record in the notebook as follows : 

(1) The temperature when the first small bubbles appear on 

the side of the flask. 

(2) Temperature when the first large bubbles appear on the 

bottom. 

(3) Temperature when many bubbles rise rapidly to the top. 

(4) Point at which temperature ceases to rise. 

(5) Temperature when vapor first appears at the mouth of the 

flask. 

(6) What differences are apparent in the amount and motion 

of the vapor before and after boiling ? 

(7) Lift the thermometer above the water and note the tem- 

perature just above the surface, when the water is 

rapidly boiling. 

The small bubbles are bubbles of air. The large are bubbles of 
steam. A complete study of the boiling process should be made in 
the Physics class. The boiling point is the point at which water 
becomes steam, and also the point at which steam condenses again 
to water. The temperature of boiling water and steam are the 
same. Under pressure steam may be heated to a higher tempera- 
ture. 

B. Boil water in a small saucepan closely covered. 

(1) Note the sounds of the water just before boiling, and the 

change in sound as the boiling begins. 

(2) Note the difference between the vapor escaping, before 

boiling, and after. This experiment is best performed 
in a teakettle. 

C. Test the temperature of the inner part of the double boiler, 

when the water boils rapidly below. To be exact, a 
hole should be bored in the cover of the boiler, a cork with 
a hole inserted, the thermometer run through the cork. 
An approximate result is obtained by putting in the 
thermometer, setting on the cover tilted, and covering 
the opening with a cloth. 

D. Stir salt into rapidly boiling water in the lower part of the 



74 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

double boiler until no more salt will dissolve (a saturated 
solution). Test the temperature. 

E. Put the inner part of the double boiler containing water into 
this boiling solution of saturated salt, being sure that 
the inner part is sufficiently deep in the salt solution. 
Note the temperature of the water in the inner boiler 
when it becomes heated. 

Boiling at high altitudes. When the air pressure upon 
the surface of the water is lessened, the water boils at a lower 
temperature. As the altitude increases, the air pressure 
decreases, as many a mountain traveler knows to his cost. 
The boiling temperature of water is so much lowered that 
t"he dwellers in high regions of several thousand feet find 
it difficult to cook starchy vegetables well. A heavy iron 
pot is made with clamps for fastening down a tight cover, 
which increases the temperature somewhat. Experiments D 
and E indicate a method that can be used to a small extent. 
The baking process should be largely used, and boiling 
avoided. For meat, eggs, and fish the lower temperature is 
not undesirable. (See the chapters relating to these foods.) 

The uses of ice. Water freezes and ice melts at the 
same point, 32 F., or C. If ice is mixed with salt, the 
temperature is reduced far below the freezing point, nearly 
to F. This process reduces any watery substance which it 
surrounds to its freezing point, the heat being used in the 
melting of the ice. This is an interesting topic to discuss 
in the Physics class. 

Ice at its ordinary temperature of 32 F. is used for cooling 
food agreeably. Its most important function in the refrigera- 
tor is as preserver of food for a short time at least. For 
this it is invaluable, and cheap ice is really necessary in 
summer to the health of a great city. 

Ice substitutes. Where the supply fails or the price is 
exorbitant, one property of water makes it a partial aid. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 75 

The rapid evaporation of water will absorb heat so rapidly 
as to reduce the temperature of adjacent bodies. In the 
tropics when ice is lacking, water is hung in porous jars in the 
breeze, and the temperature of the water in the jar is reduced. 

To keep milk and butter cool wrap a wet cloth about the 
containing jar, and set the jar upon the window sill, keeping 
one end of the towel in a vessel of water ; or the cloth may 
be wrapped directly around the butter. This method is 
surprisingly effective. 

Fruit beverages. Fruit juices with water and sugar 
make refreshing beverages and have nutritive value as well. 
(See the next chapter.) k 

Cocoa and chocolate, coffee, and tea. These are the 
three most important non-alcoholic beverages used by man. 
They are used because of the agreeable flavor given them by 
volatile oils, and also because they have a stimulating effect. 
The stimulating property is due to an alkaloid, a crystalliz- 
able substance known in cocoa as theobromine, in coffee as 
caffeine, and in tea as theine. Chemical investigation in- 
dicates that caffeine and theine are the same and theobromine 
is a closely related substance. These substances have a recog- 
nized stimulating effect upon the nervous system, and the 
beverages containing them should therefore be used with 
caution by all. In the opinion of the writers, tea and coffee 
should not be taken by young people under twenty-five years 
of age. Tea and coffee also contain tannin, an astringent 
substance giving a disagreeable flavor to coffee and tea when 
these are improperly made, and having an undesirable effect 
upon digestion. Chocolate contains a non-volatile fat (cocoa 
butter) in large amount, and should be classed as a food as 
well as a beverage. 

The plants from which cocoa, coffee, and tea are derived 
are natives of semi-tropical or tropical Africa, Asia, and 



76 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

America, having been introduced to Europe by early travel- 
ers in these lands. 

The introduction of these beverages is an interesting bit of his- 
tory. The Spaniards found cocoa in tropical America, and carried 
it back to Spain, and it was not used in England until 1657. It 
was sold in Danvers, Massachusetts, in 1771, the raw material 
having been brought by Gloucester fishermen from the West Indies. 
Coffee is said to have originated in Abyssinia, reaching Europe by 
way of Arabia, and being sold in England in 1650. Coffee-houses 
were licensed in America in 1715. A Chinese tradition places the 
discovery of the use of tea at 2700 B.C. It was first used in England 
in 1657, and was imported into America in 1711. An amusing 
story is told of the first tea party in a town of western Connecticut, 
where the tea was boiled violently in a large iron kettle and served 
on a platter with the leaves, as a form of soup, the leaves themselves 
being eaten. 

Cocoa and chocolate. Cocoa and chocolate are manu- 
factured from the seed of a tree, Theobroma cacao, grown in 
tropical America. The seeds, when removed from the con- 
taining pod, are fermented to improve the flavor, dried, 
cleaned, roasted, and finally ground. The outer husk is 
loosened in the roasting, and is then removed, and sold 
as " cocoa shells." It is the basis of a cheap beverage 
with an agreeable flavor. The first crushing of the seeds 
gives cocoa " nibs," and these are further ground in a mill, 
and finally molded into the cake of plain chocolate. The 
addition of sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, and sometimes other 
spices gives a variety of sweet chocolates. Powdered cocoa 
is prepared by the removal of the fat, which is a valuable 
product in itself, sugar and flavorings are added and some- 
times a starch. The Dutch manufacturers use alkalies 
for removing the crude fiber and improving the color, and 
the consequent loss of flavor is balanced by the use of other 
flavoring matter. The adulterations of cocoa are largely 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 77 

starch in excess. The French and American cocoas are 
flavored with vanilla, the Dutch manufacturers using cinna- 
mon as well. 

The so-called soluble cocoas are very finely ground, and 
therefore mix readily with water, remaining in suspension 
for some time, but the cocoa itself is not dissolved. Powdered 
cocoa is bought in tin cans, is cheap, and is even more eco- 
nomical if bought in large cans than in small. Chocolate is 
more expensive always than the cocoa, and may be bought 
in cakes in pound packages, or in powdered form for im- 
mediate use. 

Coffee is the inner seed of a berry from a tree, Coffea arabica, 
the process of manufacture consisting of the removal of the 
outer pulp, fermentation, washing, drying, and roasting. 
The first stages of the process are carried on at the coffee 
plantation, the raw berries being imported, and roasted 
shortly before using. The roasting in cocoa, coffee, and 
tea is necessary for desirable flavors, the heat developing 
volatile, aromatic principles, caramelizing the sugar, and 
causing other chemical changes. The differences in the flavor 
of coffees are due to the variety, the soil and climate, and 
methods of production and manufacture. No coffee grown 
in the western hemisphere has excelled, and scarcely has any 
equaled, the original Mocha and Java coffees, and these 
have long been trade names for coffee from other places, 
because of the popular liking for these brands. Brazil is 
now the great coffee producing country of the world, and from 
South and Central America and the West Indies we obtain 
coffee of excellent flavor. 

The adulterations of coffee should be noted, although 
these are of the kind that gives the buyer something cheaper 
in place of coffee, rather than a substance that is injurious. 
Ground chicory root is sometimes mixed with coffee, but 



78 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cannot be classed strictly as an adulterant, because many 
people, notably the French, add it openly, preferring its 
flavor. Among adulterants are rye meal, bran, beans and 
peas, cocoa shells, and even sawdust. Artificial beans have 
been made of bran, molasses, and water, sometimes with the 
addition of chicory and coloring matter. If ground coffee is 
put into a glass of cold water, it floats on the top and remains 
hard, while several of the adulterants named soften and sink 
to the bottom of the glass. Highly roasted coffee, however, 
will sometimes sink. Coffee beans from which coffee ex- 
tract has been made are sometimes mixed with other coffee. 

Coffee extracts and crystallized coffee are manufactured 
to simplify the coffee-making process, but the flavor is not 
equal to that of coffee infusion made directly from the bean. 
A preparation of coffee is also offered with the caffeine re- 
moved by some chemical process, but it is expensive in this 
country. 

Buy coffee in the bean, and see that it is freshly roasted. 
Coffee, whole or ground, is sold extensively by the pound in 
tin cans, with a fancy label and name, and in this form it is 
usually expensive. Good coffee may be bought for twenty- 
five cents a pound of many reliable dealers, and may be pur- 
chased in five or ten pound packages, or bought in bulk to be 
kept in a tightly closed can. 

Tea is the dried leaf of a shrub, Camellia thea, growing in 
the comparatively high lands of Japan, China, India, and 
Ceylon. A tea plantation exists in South Carolina, U.S.A., 
and furnishes a very pleasing grade of tea, somewhat re- 
sembling Japan tea in flavor. We are familiar with the 
fact that there are many kinds and grades of tea, the tea 
shrub varying as does the coffee tree, and the methods of 
curing affecting both color and flavor. The teas from the 
countries named have characteristic flavors, and each 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 79 

country has different varieties and grades. Russian tea is 
not grown in Russia, but is Chinese tea carried across the 
continent of Asia. 

In general, tea may be classed as green or black, this 
difference in color depending upon the age of the leaf, and 
largely upon differences in the curing process. Green tea 
is made from the young leaf, and after picking is dried im- 
mediately by artificial heat, being constantly stirred for about 
an hour, in which time the leaves twist and curl. For black 
tea the leaves are allowed to wilt and ferment, before they 
are rolled and heated ; and sometimes the heating is repeated. 
These details of the process vary in different localities. The 
leaves are finally sorted and graded for packing. 

Both black and green teas are made in China. " Bohea " 
is one of the famous black Chinese teas. " English Breakfast 
Tea " is known as such only in America, and is a blend of 
black teas. Black tea is not so successfully made in Japan 
as in China. " Oolong," from the island of Formosa, has 
the appearance of a black tea, with the flavor of a green. 
In Japan and China old-time methods prevail, with much 
handling of the tea leaves, but in Ceylon and India modern 
machinery makes the process a much more cleanly one. 

Another classification of tea is that depending upon the 
age and size of the leaf, the young leaf making the finer grade 
tea. For example, in the black teas of India " flowery 
pekoe " is made from the youngest leaf, " orange pekoe " 
from the second, " pekoe " from the third, and " souchong " 
and " congou " come from the larger leaves. 

The adulterations of tea are usually the leaves of other 
plants, but as a matter of fact very little adulterated tea is 
imported. The first grades of teas, however, and those 
most highly prized by the Chinese and Japanese, seldom 
find their way to America. 



80 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other beverages. Several very acceptable coffee sub- 
stitutes are on the market, made from roasted and ground 
grain, and they give an agreeable hot drink for breakfast 
when served with cream or milk. In some cases they seem 
to have a laxative effect, which is well for some people and 
not for others. A pleasant hot drink of the same nature 
may be made from the browned crusts of bread. 

The substitutes for tea are not usually satisfactory. The 
Indians of the western coast of the United States make a tea 
from a plant which they call " Buona Yerba," but for us it 
has a strong resemblance to the medicinal herb teas formerly 
used for curative purposes, such as sage, catnip, motherwort, 
and the like. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 
i. Lemonade and fruit drinks. 

Utensils. Silver knife for paring and slicing, glass lemon 
squeezer, a grater, a strainer, and a saucepan. Avoid the 
use of tin and iron utensils. 

Materials. Lemon or other fruits, sugar water. 

Proportions. One half lemon to a glass, or 2 or 3 to a quart 
of water. Other fruits ' ' according to taste. ' ' Experiment here, 
using the juice and pulp of any fruit, combining those that 
are very acid with those that lack acidity, lemon and rasp- 
berry, for example. One third to \ cup sugar to a quart. The 
proportion cannot be stated with exactness, for fruit varies in 
acidity, and the final result must always be tested by the taste. 

Method. 

Plain lemonade. After deciding upon the proper amounts 
to be used, dissolve the sugar in a part of the water, brought 
to the boiling point. When cool, add the lemon juice and re- 
maining water, ice and serve. A small portion of grated rind 
may be added to the boiling water. 

Another method is to use lump sugar, rubbing the peel of the 
lemon upon each lump before dissolving. 

The general method is the same with other fruits, pulpy fruit 
and berries being mashed, the water added, and strained. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 81 

Cherries, strawberries, and pieces of pulp are sometimes added 
before serving, when the fruit drink is ladled from a bowl as 
fruit punch. Be sure to cut the berries if they are large. A 
brightness is imparted to the fruit punch by the addition of 
carbonated water just before serving. A quart of fruit punch, 
if served in small cups, will suffice for eight people. 

Cocoa shells. 

Principle. To extract the flavor from the shells, by boiling 
in water. 

Utensil. A saucepan or coffee boiler. 

Proportions. One half cup shells to 1 quart boiling water. 
As much as 1 cup of the shells may be used. 

Method. 

Wash the shells in a strainer under the faucet. Put the 
shells in the pot, pour on boiling water, and simmer gently for 
\ hour. Strain off, and serve with cream, or milk, or evap- 
orated milk and sugar. 

Cocoa. 

Principle. To mix the particles smoothly and evenly with 
the liquid by stirring and by heating. 

Utensils. A measuring cup, a saucepan, spoon, and beater. 
A double boiler, if milk only is used. 

Ingredients. Powdered cocoa, sugar, water, or milk, or 
milk and water. Cocoa made with milk does not agree with 
some people, in which case it may be made with water only, 
and served with cream, milk, or evaporated milk. 

Proportions. One teaspoonful of cocoa to \ measuring cup. 
More or less as preferred. One teaspoonful of sugar, ditto. 

Method. 

Heat the liquid. Stir a portion of the liquid cold, with 
the cocoa, add this to the hot liquid, add the sugar, and beat 
vigorously for a minute before removing from the fire. 

Chocolate. 

Principle. To mix the chocolate smoothly with the liquid 
that the fat may not float on the top. This is accomplished 
by having all the ingredients either hot or cold. If after the 
chocolate is dissolved in a hot liquid, cold liquid is added, the 
oil separates and floats. 
G 



82 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Utensils. A grater, or sharp knife, a saucepan, mixing 
spoon, and beater. 

A French chocolate maker claims that any metal utensil 
affects the flavor of the chocolate, and always uses an earthen 
pot and wooden spoon and heater. An earthenware choco- 
late pot for this purpose is on the market. 

Ingredients. Chocolate, sugar, milk, or milk and water. 

Proportions. The amount of chocolate may be varied, de- 
pending upon the richness desired. Three or 4 ou,nce squares 
to 1 quart liquid, 4 teaspoonfuls sugar to 1 quart. The liquid 
is better half milk and half water, rather than milk only. 

Method I. 1 

The cold method. 

Put the liquid and sugar into the saucepan. Break or cut 
the chocolate into small pieces, add to the liquid, and heat the 
liquid slowly, stirring occasionally but not constantly. When 
the liquid is hot, just before it reaches the boiling point, beat 
vigorously with a wooden spoon, or beater. The Dover 
beater is convenient. This beating makes a velvety smooth 
and a foamy mixture. 

Method 2. 1 

The hot method. 

Heat the liquid with the sugar. Grate the chocolate or shave 
it with a knife. Protect the chocolate from the warmth of 
the fingers by a piece of paper. The process is less " sticky " 
if the chocolate and grater are chilled in the refrigerator. 
Just as the liquid is reaching the boiling point, pour in the 
grated chocolate, and beat vigorously. 1 

Beaten chocolate does not need any additional cream when 
served. Beaten whipped cream is attractive on the top of each 
cup. But remember that chocolate is already rich in fat, and 
that additional fat may be indigestible. Such a cup of choco- 
late taken for luncheon with a roll is sufficient for the meal, and 
is certainly too rich in fat for serving at an afternoon tea. 

5. Coffee. 

Principle. To extract the flavoring oils at the boiling point 
of water, and to avoid the extraction of the tannin. The 



1 Both these methods were taught by French cooks connected with well 
known chocolate firms, and both give good results. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 



83 



tannin is extracted by prolonged boiling, and when the liquid 
coffee stands upon the grounds. 

Utensils. Coffee grinder, measuring cup, pot. The kind of 
pot depends upon the method used. One house furnishing 
firm displays some 
seventy different 
coffee pots, but 
they may be di- 
vided into three 
classes, the pot for 
boiling, the drip 
coffee pot, and the 
percolator (see Figs. 
23 and 24). The 

coffee boiler should .

FIG. 23. 



have a lip, and not 

a spout. A word 

of warning is needed in regard to the care of the pot. Coffee 

grounds should be removed from any pot immediately, and the 

pot washed at once in scalding hot soapsuds, rinsed, dried, and 

aired. Let the pot stand with 
cover off. If this is not done, a 
coat is soon formed on the inside 
of the pot, which spoils the flavor 
of the coffee. Where the pot has 
been neglected, boiling it out with 
a solution of caustic soda is some- 
times a remedy. 

Ingredients. Ground coffee, 
water, cold or boiling, white of 
egg or egg shell for boiled coffee. 
The coffee should be ground to 
medium fineness for boiled coffee, 
to a finer powder for the per- 
colated and drip coffee. 

Proportions. One part of 

coffee to 5 or 6 of water, depending upon the strength desired. 

One egg shell, or half the white of an egg to 1 cup of ground 

coffee.

FIG. 24. A coffee percolator. 



84 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method 1. 

Boiling. Measure the coffee and water. Stir the white or 
the shell of an egg with the coffee, adding a little of the water, put 
this into the pot, add the remaining water cold, stir thoroughly, 
allow the water to rise slowly to the boiling point, and to boil 
one minute, remove the pot from the fire, pour in a 
small amount of cold water, and let the coffee stand for 
five minutes or until the grounds settle. During the cooking 
close the lip with clean soft paper if it has no lid. The 
actual boiling is continued for a brief period only, and coffee 
made by this method is considered by some people to have a 
flavor lacking in drip or percolator coffee. The egg is added 
to clarify the coffee. Pour off the liquid coffee from the grounds, 
and keep hot until it is time to serve it. 

A second method differs from this in that the water is poured 
on at the boiling temperature, allowed to reach the boiling 
point in two or three minutes, and boiled for five minutes. 
The first gives uniformly better results. It is true, however, 
that different kinds of coffee need different treatment, and 
there is room here for much experimenting. 

Method. 

Drip coffee. In this method the coffee is put in a recep- 
tacle above, the water passes slowly through, collecting in the 
pot below, from which it is served. Stand the lower part 
of the pot in a pan of hot water, or where it will keep hot. 
Measure the water, and bring it to the boiling point. Heat 
the ground coffee slightly, put it in the upper section of the 
pot, and pour on the water very slowly. Of course, the water 
is not actually boiling when it touches the coffee. If the liquid 
coffee is not strong enough, pour it from the lower part and 
pass it through the grounds again. This is the French method, 
and is an excellent way to prepare after-dinner coffee. 

Method 3. 

Percolator coffee. In the percolator the water boils within 
the pot, and passes through the coffee at the boiling tem- 
perature. The exact method depends upon the pattern of 
the pot, and directions always accompany a given pot. For 
those who can use electricity, the electric percolator certainly 
gives an excellent coffee. 



WATER AND OTHER BEVERAGES 85 

Coffee is served " black," or with cream, milk, or evaporated 
milk and sugar. If milk is used for breakfast coffee, serve it hot. 

6. Tea. 

Principle. To extract flavor by allowing the leaves to re- 
main for a few minutes, in water which has been poured on 
at the boiling temperature, and to avoid the extraction of 
tannin by making the period of steeping short. Tea must 
never be boiled. 

Utensils. An earthen pot, measuring cup, teaspoon, 
strainer. Sometimes a tea ball or piece of cheesecloth. 

Proportion. One teaspoonful of tea to about 1 cup ot" 
water, the amount depending upon the kind of tea. 

Method. Measure the water and bring it to the boiling 
point. Heat the tea slightly in the pot, pour on the water 
rapidly, allow to stand three to five minutes, strain into a 
heated pot for serving. The length of the steeping depends 
also upon the kind of tea. If there is an astringent flavor, the 
tea has stood too long. 

The following method was recommended by an expert in 
India teas. Bring the water to a boil in a saucepan, throw 
in the tea leaves, lift the saucepan instantly to stop the boil- 
ing, steep for 3 or 4 minutes, strain off and keep hot. This 
expert claimed that by actually having the tea leaves at the 
boiling temperature for an instant the flavor is improved. 
Serve with cream or milk, or sliced lemon and sugar. 

Where tea is to be served in very large quantities, this last 
method is very convenient. The water can be brought to the 
boil in a large kettle, and the tea thrown in, but care must be 
exercised to see that the steeping does not last too long. The 
tea, once decanted, can be kept hot for several hours, without 
losing flavor. Or again, a small amount of extra strong tea 
may be prepared, to be diluted with boiling water as it is 
served. The tea ball, or the plan of tying the tea in small 
pieces of cheesecloth, is convenient for serving at an after- 
noon tea. 

7. Iced cocoa, coffee, and tea. 

Cocoa and coffee are agreeable in hot weather served in a 
glass with ice, and cream and powdered sugar. Make both 



86 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

slightly stronger than for hot drinks, as the ice in melting 
dilutes the liquid. 

Iced tea. Prepare a small amount of strong tea, using 4 
teaspoonfuls to 1 cup boiling water, strain off and cool. Dilute 
with iced water to the proper strength, sweeten with powdered 
sugar, and serve in glasses with one or two slices of lemon to 
each glass. For those who do not like the lemon, iced tea may 
be served with cream. 

EXERCISES 

1. 'What are the functions of water in the body? 

2. What cautions should be exercised when drinking water? 

3. Explain the likenesses and differences of cocoa and chocolate, 
coffee and tea. 

4. Why is it better to serve whipped cream with cocoa, rather 
than with chocolate? 

5. Explain the principles in making each beverage. 



TEACHER'S NOTE. The beverages are treated in one chapter for con- 
venience, but need not of necessity come at the beginning of the course. 
A fruit beverage, or cocoa, may make a convenient first lesson, when the 
pupils are becoming acquainted with the school kitchen. Coffee and tea 
may be made during the baking lessons. 



CHAPTER VI 
FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 

THE United States is fortunate in the native fruit supply, 
including as it does so many degrees of latitude and longitude 
with the differences in altitude, climate, and soil needed by 
different varieties. Now that we count Porto Rico among 
our possessions, a list of our fruits would include most of the 
varieties known in the temperate and semi-tropical zones. 
The United States Department of Agriculture experiments 
with new varieties from foreign lands that may make them- 
selves at home in. our soil, and work like that of Luther Bur- 
bank produces new species. Scientific methods of fruit 
growing are becoming more common, and the quality of 
fruit will doubtless improve in spite of fungous diseases and 
injurious insects. Our wild fruits are not yet entirely rooted 
out. The Maine blueberry, for example, is found on hundreds 
of acres and needs no cultivation beyond burning over every 
third jear. 

Fruit is necessary in our diet, and is not an extravagance 
unless we buy fancy varieties brought from a distance, or 
native fruits out of season. 

Composition and nutritive value. The chief foodstuffs 
in fruits are carbohydrates and mineral matter. Fresh 
fruit contains from 75 to 95 per cent of water, and its presence 
is apparent in such juicy fruits as the melon and the orange. 
Figure 25 shows that seemingly dry fruits like the banana 
and the apple also contain much water. Even fruits which 
have been artificially dried, like prunes and raisins, contain

processes of the body than that prescribed medicinally. 
The bulk given by cellulose, and the laxative property of 
fruit acids also are safeguards against constipation, especially 
in a meat diet. Fruit is the best possible dessert after a 
hearty meat dinner. 

The digestibility of fruit is increased for some people by 
cooking. This is probably due to the softening of the fiber, 
to the destruction of any bacteria present, and in the case of 
the banana, to the cooking of the starch. Fruit juice can

he taken by little children and invalids who might find the 
fiber troublesome. Some people cannot eat berries on ac- 
count of irritation caused by the seeds. In this case, juice 
may be squeezed from cooked berries and used for beverages 
and jelly. 

How to buy. Since we should eat fruit daily, and not 
merely as a " treat," it is important to practice economy in 
buying it. Fresh fruits in season, and dried fruits are the 
cheapest. Canned fruit is economical when it is a product 
of one's own garden, or put up when some fruit has a low 
market price. Prices are so variable, even with one variety, 
that no definite sum can be given as a fixed price. Apples 
vary from fifty cents a bushel near the orchard and in season, 
to ten cents apiece for a fancy table variety in the winter. 
When you buy fresh fruit, inquire the prices of the many kinds 
offered, note which is cheapest, and then observe whether 
the cheaper kind is such because it is abundant, or because it 
is of inferior quality. If you chance to want apples for cook- 
ing, and the only cheap apples are spotted and bruised, then 
buy dried apples, or even canned. It is best to decide upon 
the fruit after you have studied market conditions rather than 
before.

Cooked Fruits 
Principles of cooking. 

The fiber, and skin when retained, are softened. 
Flavors are developed at a low temperature long continued. A 
high temperature at the end of process, browns, and adds 
flavor. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 93 

Flavors retained by prevention of evaporation through covering 

tightly. 

Bacteria and molds are destroyed. 
Adjuncts. Sugar. Sometimes a bit of butter. 
Acid fruit juices, or 
An acid jelly. 

Seeded raisins, with acid fruit, as sour apples. 
Nutmeg or cinnamon with some fruits. 
Cooking processes. Stewing and baking. 
Utensils. Knife and corer. 

Stew pan, enamel ware, close cover. 
Round or square baking pans, enamel ware, covered. 
Earthenware pot, covered. 

Methods. If you can cook one fruit, you can cook all. Two 
common fruits are selected for your experiments, the apple 
and the prune ; both are delicious, and both contain iron, 
the prune more than the apple. 

The apple. A tart variety is best for cooking. The Greening 

and the Baldwin are excellent. 
Apples are cooked whole, or as a sauce. 
Whole, cooked with or without the skin, either stewed or 

baked. 

For cooking whole, select those of uniform size. 
For cooking whole, with the skin, select those with fair skins. 
For cooking whole without skin, select firm texture, not mellow. 
An apple sauce may consist of slices, or may be mashed or strained, 

and may be either stewed or baked. Less perfect apples 

may be used than for baking. 
First step for all. Wash, and examine carefully for blemishes, 

bruises, and insects in the interior. 

i. Whole apple baked, with skin. 

(1) Remove core. 

(2) Place in pan, with enough water to barely cover the 

bottom of the pan. 

(3) Pour sugar into the holes. 

(4) A bit of butter may be put on the top of the sugar. 

(5) Nutmeg or cinnamon may be mixed with the sugar if 

the apples are flat in taste. 



94 /'V)OMS AND HurxHHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) Cover the pan, and bake in a moderate oven, until the 
apples are tender. The length of time depends upon 
the quality of the apple. (See class experiment.) 
Half apples. This is a modification of (1). 

Cut the apples in two crosswise, and proceed as with the 
whole apple. 

2. Whole apples baked, without skin. A good method when skins 

are tough. 

(1) Remove core and pare. 

(2) Place in earthen baking dish. The remainder of the 

process is the same. 

(3) Serve in the dish in which they are baked. 

(4) Currant jelly, or seeded raisins may be placed in the core 

holes instead of sugar. 

Class experiment. Bake side by side two apples of uniform 
size, one with, one without, the skin. Note carefully the length 
of time for baking each. What difference? Why is this? It 
may be necessary in the school kitchen to bake in a quick oven, 
on account of the shortness of the class period. It does not spoil 
the apple to do this ; but the longer process that you can use at 
home gives a richer color and flavor. 

For this experiment, one pupil may bake the apple without the 
skin, and the next pupil one with the skin in case there is but one 
apple apiece ; or it may be made a class experiment with two apples. 

3. Whole, stewed. (Compote.) This is a more difficult method 

than method 2, and really no better. 

(1) Core and pare five or six apples. 

(2) Dissolve \ cup sugar in \ pint water in a saucepan. 

(3) Place apples in the sirup. They should be barely 

covered. 

(4) Cover closely and keep just below the boiling point, 

until the apples are tender. 

(5) Cool slightly, remove the apples with care and place in 

the serving dish. Put a spoonful of jelly in each apple. 

(6) Boil down the sirup and pour it over the apples. 

(7) Chill, before serving with plain or whipped cream. 

4. Apple sauces. In the cooking of the whole apple you have 

all the principles and processes of apple cooking. You 
can now make apple sauce of your own invention, and need 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 95 

no printed directions. Answer these questions before you 
begin work. After you have made the sauce, record the 
work exactly in your notebook. 

If you want the slices of apple to remain whole, will the method 
be like i, 2, or 3? 

If you wish a smooth sauce, what utensil will you need? 

How will you determine the amount of sugar required? If 
you are very fond of sugar, your taste may not be the safest guide. 

Practical home work. If you can secure a very slow oven, say a 
coal oven at night, or a gas oven with a low flame, make an apple 
sauce in an earthenware pot, as heavy as a bean pot, closely covered, 
leaving the pot in the oven from six to eight hours. This process is 
satisfactory in a fireless cooker where a hot stone or iron is used. 
Remember that water keeps down temperature, and also that it 
evaporates steadily even in a slow oven. How much water will you 
put over the apples when the process begins? 

If you have never cooked apples in this way you will be sur- 
prised at the color and flavor. 

Some other fruits. Pears and quinces develop pleasing flavors 
when baked. 

Cook the quinces sliced, as suggested for the apples, in the bean 
pot, using a little molasses for sweetening and you will have the 
delicious old-time " molasses quince." 

Prunes. We are dealing now with a dried fruit. If you com- 
pare the raisins with the grapes in Fig. 26, you will see how much 
water is lost in the drying process. The same difference would be 
evident if you had pictures of a fresh plum and a prune, side by side. 
This water must be supplied in the process of preparation. The 
best way to accomplish this is by soaking the prunes many hours, 
say over night. Prunes have a most undeserved reputation, because 
they are not well cooked, and at some tables are served too often. 

With this one new step introduced you may plan the cooking 
of the prunes, from what you know of apple sauce. The slower 
and longer the process, the better. The cheaper kinds of prunes 
will be very satisfactory, with the soaking and slow cooking. What 
is the sensible thing to do in regard to sugar? 

If on some occasion you would like prunes to be unusually nice, 
remove the stones carefully, and in their places slip in seeded raisins 
which have also been soaked and gently stewed. 



96 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Other dried fruits may be treated in the same way. 
Apricots and peaches yield delightful flavors when carefully 
prepared ; and dried apples are also excellent. 

PRESEKVATION OF FRUIT AND OTHER FOODS 

The preservation of fruit and other foods has been a house- 
hold industry for generations, and it is now an important 
commercial industry. The old-time farm had its smoke- 
house where hams and beef were " cured," the barrel of brine 
stood in the cellar for pork and corned beef, apples and 
corn were dried for winter use, and rows of preserve jars 
stood upon the shelves. Food was preserved by simple 
processes long before the reason for the decay and spoiling 
of food was fully understood, but with larger knowledge and 
better appliances, we now preserve food more effectively and 
in quantities larger than were possible in former days. 

Fruit is the food material now most commonly preserved 
in the home kitchen. Vegetables need to be subjected to 
heat for a much longer time than fruit, and many people 
prefer to buy canned vegetables rather than to go to the 
trouble and expense of canning them at home. Where 
there is an oversupply of vegetables in the home garden, it 
is sometimes economy to can them, and this may be done if 
care is exercised. The cost of fuel and labor must be counted 
in, when studying the question of home preserving versus 
buying the canned product. 

Whatever the food material, and the process, the principles 
of preservation are the same for all. 

Why does food spoil? The decay and moldiness of 
fresh fruit are matters of common observation; and the 
housekeeper knows that mold is liable to cover the top of a 
jelly glass, and that a can of fruit will ferment at times, 
even to the point of bursting the can. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 



97 



We recognize another kind of deterioration in meat and 
fish that have become tainted, even when no mold is visible, 
and there is no opportunity for ordinary fermentation. The 
microscope has given us eyes to see, and as a result of the 
patient work of the scientist with this instrument we now 
know that the difficulties in keeping food are caused by the 
presence of minute vegetable organisms known as molds, 




Buchanan's Household Bacteriology. 
FIG. 28. Three species of mold. 

yeasts, and bacteria. It is impossible in some cases to draw 
a sharp line between these different forms of lower life, yet 
we are able to distinguish them sufficiently for practical 
purposes. 

Masses of mold that can be seen with the naked eye are 
distinguished by a feathery appearance and bright color. 
Figure 28 shows three species of the green mold that affects 
jam and jellies. Other species are found in Roquefort 
and Camembert cheese, and give the flavors characteristic 
in these cheeses. 

The presence of yeast can be detected by its action, but it 
cannot itself be seen without the microscope. When canned 
fruit or homemade fruit juice " works," yeasts cells are 



98 



FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



present in great number. Figure 29 shows one form of 
yeast, highly magnified, and Fig. 30 shows a single yeast 
cell. The yeast cake is a mixture of thousands of such cells

FIG. 29. One form of yeast. 

with some flour or flour and meal, and the cells lie dormant 
in the cake, until we are ready to use them in bread. (See 
Chapter XII.) The actual yeast, however, is what Fig. 
30 shows it to be, a tiny, one-celled 
plant, increasing in number by the 
division of the single cell, or by the 
budding out of one cell from another. 
When conditions are favorable the 
yeast cells increase in number with 
great rapidity, and some of the sugar 
that is present is broken down into 
carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. It 
is this gas that causes the familiar 
bubbling when fermentation is taking place. We put yeast 
cells into bread and cultivate it for this gas. But how does 
it occur in canned fruits, when its presence is not desired? 
Wild yeast floats in the air, and lies upon the surface of fruit. 
All cultivated yeast has been derived from wild yeast. In 
old-fashioned ways of bread-making no yeast was introduced,

a soft dough being left in a warm place to ferment naturally, 
the yeast cells probably being present in the flour. The 
yeast that spoils the canned fruit is present in the fruit, in 
the utensils, or can, and has not been killed as it should be 
in the canning process. 

The bacteria are also one-celled microorganisms, smaller 
than the yeast. Figure 31 shows the four types of bacterial 
cells. Their size is measured by the unit used in the

microscope, called the micron, which is about ^wo^ of one 
inch. Bacteria may measure from one to three or four of 
these microns in length. Some bacteria are reproduced by 
means of spores which form within the cell. Bacteria, as 
they develop in some material, produce substances from the 
material that may or may not be injurious to us. One im- 
portant truth about the bacteria is this : that many of them 
are harmless, and may even be made useful, as in the 
manufacture of fruit vinegar. The pleasant acid of butter- 
milk and of sour milk is due also to bacteria which are 
not harmful to us. However, there may be disease pro- 
ducing bacteria present in milk that is not clean, and 
their presence must not be tolerated. Other bacteria, de- 



100 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

veloping in meat and fish, produce substances known as 
ptomaines, which are dangerous poisons ; or, more often, the 
kinds of bacteria which thrive, in meats and fish may them- 
selves be directly injurious to man. 

It is evident, therefore, that the problem before us is the 
control of these lower organisms, that we may increase or 
destroy them as we will. 

The control of microorganisms. With warmth, water, 
and food all living things flourish and grow ; most organisms 
require air, but some of the microorganisms do not. Where 
these conditions are best met, the organism is most active 
and multiplies most rapidly. To retard growth or to destroy 
life, the conditions must be the reverse of favorable. While 
warmth, say a temperature from 70 to 90 F., promotes the 
life of most microorganisms, intense heat destroys it. The 
boiling temperature, 212 F., will kill these lower organisms, 
although this heat has to be continued for some length of 
time, particularly in the case of spores. The spores of 
certain bacteria are quite resistant. A temperature of 32 F. 
and lower retards growth, but it requires extreme cold to 
destroy bacteria. Since moisture is necessary to all the lower 
organisms, they do not develop in a dry material or dry 
place. 

We cannot destroy these lower forms of life by removing 
food from them, since they are ever present, but we can 
make the food unavailable to them through the introduction 
in the material of certain substances called preservatives 
which prevent their growth. The preservatives long familiar 
are salt, sugar, wood-smoke, spices, vinegar, and alcohol. 
While a small amount of sugar is necessary in the fermenta- 
tion process, a large amount acts as a preservative, as in 
candied fruit. It is an interesting fact that alcohol and 
vinegar, products of fermentation processes, tend (when 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION Y* 



sufficiently concentrated) to stop the growth of the fermen- 
tation organisms. 

To the reader who desires a fuller account of the bacteria, 
yeast, and molds, especially as related to household affairs, 
Buchanan's " Household Bacteriology" is recommended as 
the most recent and satisfactory book in this field. 

A word about buying canned goods. When canned goods 
are put up in large quantities at the factory, abuses are likely 
to exist. Poor, even decayed, fruit may be used, the whole 
process may be unclean from beginning to end, and unde- 
sirable preservatives or an excess of sugar or spice may be in- 
troduced to cover the use of poor materials or methods. The 
condition of the worker in the cannery is one of the important 
industrial problems at the present time. Unhappily, poor 
conditions do often exist in canneries that turn out a cheap 
product. On the other hand, there are firms that may well 
take pride in their system from beginning to end. 

Serving canned food. All canned food should be ex- 
posed to the air for a short time before serving, and stirred 
that the material may be aerated. This partially removes a 
certain flatness of taste. Canned fruit is improved by re- 
heating, even. 

When possible, vegetables bought in a tin can should be 
washed in the colander before they are heated. This greatly 
improves the flavor.

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. Thoroughly wash all the utensils, just 
before using. Sterilize the cans and glasses by placing them in a 
large kettle or boiler on the stove, covering them with cold water,

and allowing the water to reach the boiling point and to boil for 
half an hour. Covers and rubber rings should be treated in the 
same way. 

Prepare the fruit by careful washing, picking over, paring and 
cutting. 

The skins may be loosened on peaches and tomatoes by pouring 
hot water over them. 

Weigh both fruit and sugar, or measure if no scales are available. 

See that the cooking apparatus is in good order, that the proper 
heat may be continued. 

Avoid rapid boiling of the fruit. 



104 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Place the cans when they are to be filled with hot fruit upon a 
towel wet in very hot water, or in a pan holding an inch or so of 
hot water. Never hold the can or glass in the hand. 

Use a dipper for putting cooked fruit into the can. A funnel is 
useful placed in the mouth of the jar. 

Put whole fruit and halves compactly in the jar, using table- 
spoon and fork, or two tablespoons. It requires practice to do this 
well. 

See that all air bubbles are removed, and fill the cans to over- 
flowing, before putting on the glass tops and fastening on the spring. 
Wipe off the jars, carefully, and stand them on their tops for a day 
in order to test the tightness of the rubbers and the fastening. 

After filling jelly glasses, set them at one side, and cover them 
all with a piece of cheesecloth, until the jelly becomes firm. Then 
pour melted paraffin upon the jelly in each glass, and when the 
paraffin is cooled, put the covers on firmly. 

Label the jars with the name of the fruit and the date of the 
preserving before putting them away. 

Canning. 

Method 1. Material cooked before it is put into the can. This 
is a good method for berries, and for fruit that will be served as a 
sauce. Proceed in the preparation and finishing according to the 
general directions. Cook the fruit gently for half an hour. Use 
as little water as possible. No sugar is required in the canning pro- 
cess, but the flavor is better if a small amount is used in the begin- 
ning, a half cup of sugar to a pound of fruit. 

Method 2. Material cooked in the can. This is the better 
method for whole fruit and halves. Select firm, well-shaped fruit 
for this method, rejecting the mellow and soft fruit. Pack the cans 
tightly with the fruit, and pour in hot water with sugar dissolved 
in it, a half cup to the quart can. More sugar can be used, if 
so desired. Set the jars in a boiler on a rack, and surround them 
with warm water, to a height that will not allow the water to boil 
into the cans. 

Set the cover on each jar, but do not fasten them. Cover the 
boiler closely, bring the water to a boil, and allow it to boil for an 
hour. At the end of this time, test the fruit for tenderness with a 
fork, pour in more sirup if it is necessary. Remove the jars when 
the water has cooled sufficiently, and adjust the covers. Cold 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 105 

water is sometimes used at the beginning, but this makes the 
process longer. 

This is a good method also for the canning of whole vegetables 
like peas and asparagus. The cooking of vegetables should con- 
tinue for at least two hours, and three hours are better for peas and 
string beans. 

Apparatus is constructed for this method of canning, but the 
ordinary boiler answers the purpose. 

Preserving. 

A good method for peaches\ apricots, and quinces. Select firm 
and handsome fruit and prepare it carefully. Allow a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. (What is the measure of a pound of 
sugar?) Place enough water in the kettle to cover the fruit, dis- 
solve the sugar in the water, put the fruit into the kettle, and cook 
very gently until the fruit becomes a clear color. Rapid boiling 
spoils the shape of the fruit. Do not stir at all, but skim off any 
scum that rises to the top. When the fruit is done, put it with 
great care into the jars. If the sirup is thin, boil it down for a 
short time, and then fill the jar. Close the jar as in canning. 

This is a difficult process for beginners. 

Jam making, and fruit butter. 

This is the most economical of the preserving processes and the 
easiest for the novice. It is nothing more than a fruit sauce, with 
a larger amount of sugar than usual to assist in its preservation. 

Soft and somewhat imperfect fruit may be used. If in the 
basket of fruit bought for canning or preserving there are some 
fully ripe or poorly shaped specimens, these may be used for jam. 
For jam proper allow a pint of sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook the 
fruit with enough water to prevent its sticking to the kettle, using 
as little as possible. 

Mash the fruit by stirring it occasionally as it cooks. When the 
fruit is soft, add the sugar, stir thoroughly, and cook gently for 
about five minutes. Test by cooling a spoonful on a saucer. The 
jam should thicken slightly. When ready, pour it into jelly glasses, 
or somewhat larger earthen jars " jam potis." Seal, as directed 
for jelly. 

The fruit butter is even more like fruit sauce than is the jam, for 
it is softer than jam, and contains less sugar. A cup or only a half 



106 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cup of sugar to the pound of fruit is enough. Proceed exactly as 
in jam-making. 

Apple butter may be flavored with spices, with ginger root and 
lemon juice, and with other fruits. One or two quinces or a slice 
of pineapple cooked with the apples gives a pleasing variety. 
Exercise the inventive faculty here. 

Jelly making. There is another principle involved in jelly 
making in addition to the principle of preservation. Fruit contains 
a substance known as pectose, one of the carbohydrates, that 
partially solidifies the fruit juice when the water in the juice is 
partially evaporated. The addition of sugar helps in this process, 
but no amount of sugar will set the jelly if the pectose is not present. 
Some fruits have more than others, and also more when not over- 
ripe. Currants and firm apples are good jelly makers, and serve 
as a basis for other fruits that do not jelly well. Mellow summer 
apples do not set well. Crab apples are excellent for this pur- 
pose. 

There is another step in this process, the straining out of the 
juice from the pulp. For this, prepare a jelly bag from firm cotton 
cloth which has been boiled and washed. This bag must be hung 
in such a way that the juice drops from the point of the bag into a 
bowl below. It may be hung upon a stick between two chairs, or 
upon the rod of a strong towel rack over a table. 

i. Apple jelly. Select tart, red-skinned apples, cut them in small 
pieces with the skins on, retain the cores, and put them in 
a kettle with cold water to barely cover. When thoroughly 
cooked and mashed, put this pulp into the jelly bag, and 
allow the juice to drip as long as it will. Do not squeeze 
the bag, nor stir the pulp if you wish clear jelly. This drip- 
ping process is a matter of hours, and in the home kitchen 
may continue all night. Allow a pint of sugar to a pint of 
juice. Return the juice to the kettle, and allow it to simmer 
for twenty-five minutes or half an hour, skimming when 
necessary. In the meantime, heat the sugar, being careful 
not to melt or burn it. Stir the sugar gently into the juice, 
and boil five minutes. Test a little upon a saucer. It should 
show signs of jellying as it cools. Boil longer, if necessary. 
Finish as directed. Jelly often does not set until twenty-four 
hours have elapsed. 



FRUIT AND ITS PRESERVATION 107 

2. Currant jelly. The method is the same as with apple jelly. 
It is not necessary to remove the currants from the stem. 
Heat just long enough before the straining to make the juices 
flow well. 

Very agreeable flavors are secured by the combining of two 
or more fruits in a jelly ; quince and pineapple with apple ; 
a leaf of rose geranium or lemon verbena in a glass of apple 
jelly ; raspberry with currant. White apple jelly may be 
flavored with mint leaves, and used in place of mint sauce with 
meat. 

Pickling. 

Pickles are not desirable in the diet. If acid is craved, it is 
much wiser to secure it by fresh fruits, and by the use of lemon 
juice. 

Drying. 

This process should not be discarded if there is a supply of fruit 
in the orchard or garden. Place thinly sliced apples and peaches 
upon plates or trays,' protect by clean cheesecloth, and dry in the 
sun. The color may be dark, but the flavor is excellent.

Laboratory management. The fruit selected for use in the school kitchen 
depends upon the time of year. The autumn is the season for preserving, 
but some fruit is available at any time of year : in the winter, apple and 
peach butter from the dried fruit; in the spring rhubarb jam or jelly; in the 
late spring or early summer, strawberry jam. If the school program and the 
equipment permit the serving of meals by the class, fruit may be preserved 
in the fall for these occasions.

CHAPTER VII 
VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 

THE distinction between the fruit and the vegetable is 
purely arbitrary, since both are parts of plants and have the 
same general composition. Botanically the tomato is as 
truly a fruit as the apple ; but when it is stewed and served 
with meat, it is classed as a vegetable. Other parts of 
plants, however, besides the fruit are used as vegetables. 

Composition and nutritive value. Vegetables are much 
like fruits in composition, being richest usually in carbohy- 
drates and ash, but sometimes containing a large amount of 
protein. Some have carbohydrates in the form of starch, 
as the potato, and others in the form of sugar, as the beet ; 
young corn is rich in sugar, old corn in starch. All have 
more or less cellulose, that in lettuce being very tender, 
while that in beets is so firm as to be softened only by 
long cooking. Study carefully Figs. 34 and 35. Notice how 
the amount of water compares with the amount in fruits. 
See, too, that beans, both green and dry, are richer in protein 
than other vegetables. Celery has the highest percentage 
of water, and is valuable for its ash and the bulk it gives 
because of the large amount of cellulose. 

To explain these facts we must understand something of 
the physiology of the plant. The stem is the carrier of water 
and nutritive material to other parts of the plant. The 
onion bulb, the parsnip root, and the potato tuber are the 
winter storehouses of food for the next year's plant when the

leaves first sprout. In the dry bean seed, and also in the 
pea and lentil, the young plant lies dormant, with a large 
supply of all the foodstuffs ready for its first growth when 
warmth and moisture are supplied in the spring. Classified 
according to their nutritive value, the vegetables rank as 
follows. Leaves are grouped with stems. 

The seeds Contain all the foodstuffs. High in 

protein. 

Roots and tubers Contain all the foodstuffs. Low in 

and the bulb protein and fat. High in starch 

or some form of sugar. 

Rinds (squash and Contain all the foodstuffs in small 
pumpkin) amounts. Mineral content the 

chief value. 
Leaves and stems Mineral content the chief value. 

Certain substances in some vegetables are supposed to have 
a physiological effect, but we should be cautious in accepting 
statements that have not been scientifically proved ; for 
instance, that celery is "good for the nerves." It is doubt- 
less true that the oils which give onions and the cabbage 
their strong flavors do not agree with some people, and these 
vegetables should be eaten with caution. 

How to buy. Much interest is added to the study of 
vegetables by the examination of a seed catalogue easily 
obtainable from a firm selling seeds and plants. In this 
way, one may increase one's knowledge of varieties for 
planting in the home garden, even if they are not common on 
the market. City markets offer an increasing variety of 
vegetables, and the purchaser should not hesitate to buy a 
vegetable because it is new to her. An inexpensive Italian 
vegetable, fenucchi, is now sometimes found on sale, and its 
characteristic flavor is very agreeable. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 113 




114 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The season of vegetables is so extended by canning, by 
the shipping of vegetables from the South, and by growing 
under glass that there is always a wide range of choice. 
There are in winter, however, some tempting delicacies in 
the way of green vegetables that the buyer with a limited 
purse should pass by. A cucumber at fifty cents or even at 
ten cents is not a sensible purchase. Lettuce, grown under 
glass, at ten cents a head is not an extravagance, if the in- 
come allows thirty-five to forty cents per capita per day for 
food. As a rule, select the less expensive vegetable, provided 
it is in good condition. The prices are so fluctuating that a 
definite statement is impossible. (See Chapter XVII.) 

Root vegetables should be uniform in size, sound, the skins fair. 

Head vegetables should be solid, with but few waste leaves on 
the outside. 

m Vegetables with hard rind should be sound and firm. 

Asparagus should be even in size, the stalks not bitten by insects. 

Cauliflower should be firm and white, not affected by insects 
or blight. 

Celery should be firm and white, free from blemishes, fine in 
texture. 

Peas should have crisp pods well filled, but not too full. 

String beans should be crisp and snap easily. 

All leaf vegetables should be crisp not wilted. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Uncooked vegetables. Crisp vegetables with tender fiber are 
eaten raw. Their preparation includes freshening in cold water, 
thorough washing to remove grit and insects, thorough drying by 
shaking in a soft cloth or wire basket, and cooling on the ice. Let- 
tuce should not be served so wet that the water collects on the plate, 
making it impossible to dress the salad with oil. See salad making, 
Chapter XV. 

Cooked vegetables. Vegetable cooking is an art much neg- 
lected, and in consequence vegetables are sometimes served lacking 
their proper flavor and their original nutrients. To cook vege- 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 115 

tables in boiling salted water, throwing the water away, is not the 
correct method, except in a few cases. With this method much of 
the valuable mineral matter and the flavoring substances are lost 
in the water. With such strong flavored vegetables as the cabbage, 
old onions and beets, and old potatoes this method is permissible, 
but even in these cases the nutritive value is decreased. 

Principles of cooking. Softening of the fiber. 

Opening of the starch granules, when starch is present, at a tem- 
perature of 212 F. Retaining mineral and flavoring matters. 

Cooking processes. These rank in value as they do or do not 
retain the mineral and flavoring matters. 

Baking. No nutritive material lost. The best method for 
potatoes and sweet potatoes. Used also for squash, pumpkin, 
beets, young onions, dried beans, peas, and lentils. 

Steaming. (Cooking in a steamer.) No nutritive material lost. 
A good method for all fresh vegetables. Steamed vegetables have 
less flavor than baked. 

Stewing. Cooking in a stew pan or kettle with so little water 
that it is almost boiled out at the end of the process, any remaining 
liquid being served with the vegetable. The best method for 
spinach, which can be cooked with no additional water > beyond that 
remaining on the leaves from the washing. The French use this 
method almost entirely, and with tender peas and carrots they omit 
water and use butter only. A substitute for this latter is a very 
small amount of water, with the addition of butterine or some good 
butter substitute. 

Boiling. Cooking in a large amount of boiling, salted water, 
the water to be drained off and thrown away. May be used with 
old beets of rank flavor, strong onions, old potatoes, or potatoes 
boiled with the skins on. A wasteful method. 

Adjuncts. Salt, pepper, butter, or some other fat, milk, cheese, 
bread crumbs, parsley, eggs. 

Utensils. A vegetable brush, a sharp knife, a chopper, a po- 
tato masher, a strainer, a colander, a stew pan, kettle or steamer, 
baking pan, baking dish, bean pot, frying pan or kettle. 

General directions. Wash the vegetables, scrubbing the skin 
vegetables with a brush. Washing in several waters is important 
with spinach to remove all grit. Scrape off thin skins or pare off 
the thicker. Thick skins such as those of old beets are more easily 



116 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

removed after cooking. The outer covering must be removed in the 
case of peas, shell beans, and sweet corn. Pull or cut strings from 
string beans with great care. Discard all poor portions. Remove and 
throw away the inner pulp and seeds of old squashes and pumpkins. 
The whole of a tender summer squash is eatable. 

When boiling salted water is used, allow one tablespoonful of 
salt to four quarts of water. Steamed and stewed vegetables are 
salted and dressed with butter or butter substitute before serving. 
Butter is a better dressing for vegetables than white sauce. Where 
cream is available, nothing is so delicious. Use white sauce very spar- 
ingly with some escalloped vegetable for variety. Making a sauce 
adds to the labor of preparation, and the sauce hides the delicious 
flavor of a well-cooked vegetable. Some vegetables are mashed 
before serving; potatoes, turnip, squash, either boiled or baked. 
Time of cooking. The following table is a guide, but one must 
learn from practice, for the time depends upon the quality of the 
vegetable, whether tender or tough, and upon the size whether large 
or small. Test by gently inserting a fork. 

Allow more time for cooking in a steamer, than for stewing or 
boiling. It requires more time to bake a potato than to boil one of 
the same size. Why? 

Time-table 

(For stewing and boiling unless stated otherwise.) 

Fifteen minutes. Tender cabbage and sweet corn. These are 
usually cooked too long. 

Thirty minutes. Asparagus ; peas ; potatoes of medium size ; 
summer squash ; tomatoes. 

Forty-five minutes. Young beets and carrots ; onions ; young 
parsnips ; medium potatoes baked, sweet potatoes boiled. 

One hour. String and shelled beans ; cauliflower ; oyster plant ; 
winter squash, steamed or baked ; young turnips. 

Two hours. Old carrots, beets, and turnips. 

Six to eight hours (or more). Dried beans, lentils, and peas, 
baked in the oven, with water added. 

The potato, a starchy vegetable. Make it your pride to serve 
a plain potato, mealy and inviting. Potatoes are " new," fully 
ripe, and old. The new potato is in market in July and August, 
and may be recognized by its very thin skin. The later potatoes 
have a thicker skin, the color still being fresh. In the spring after 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 117 

its winter storage, the potato is " old." It -seems a little less firm, 
the color of the exterior is somewhat changed ; perhaps the buds in 
the eyes of the potato are beginning to grow. When cooked it has 
a stronger flavor, and rather darker color. If the potato has been 
frozen, a sweet flavor is developed, and the quality is waxy. Po- 
tatoes are sometimes inferior in quality when the season is a poor 
one, or when some potato disease is prevalent. The following classi- 
fication shows you in how many ways potatoes may be cooked, and 
also shows you how easy it is to classify recipes in an orderly way. 

I. Potatoes cooked whole. 

1. Steamed. 

a. With skin. 
6. Without skin. 

2. Boiled. 

a. With skin. 

5. Without skin. 

3. Baked. 

a. With skin. 

b. Without skin. 
II. Potatoes, not whole. 

1. From raw potatoes. 

a. Sliced and escalloped. 

6. Cut in cubes and stewed. 

c. Cut in slices or fancy shapes and fried. 

2. From cooked potatoes, 
a. Mashed. 

(a) From boiled potatoes, plain or browned on top. 
(6) From baked potatoes, seasoned and served in shell. 
&. Creamed. From either cold boiled or baked potatoes ; 

the latter are better, 
c. Saute. 

(a) Sliced and browned. 
(6) Hashed and browned. 

If you know some other method, see if you can fit it into this 
grouping. 

i. Baked potatoes. 

Method 1 . The best method, for new potatoes. Select those 
of uniform size. When scrubbed, place them in a shallow 



118 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

pan, or upon the rack of the oven. The oven should be hot, 
about 450 F. or even a higher temperature. (See oven tests, 
Chapter IX.) The length of time required depends upon the 
size of the potato, forty-five minutes being the average time. 

A potato is largely water. What is the temperature of the 
interior of the potato during the baking process ? 

Test by pressing firmly, protecting the fingers by a soft cloth ; 
or insert a fork. When the potato is done, it yields to the 
pressure of the fingers. If the potatoes cannot be served at 
once, break the skin that the steam may escape, cover with a 
cloth, and keep them hot. 

For convenience at the table, cut the potatoes in two length- 
wise, loosen the content of each half with a fork, sprinkle with salt, 
and add a bit of butter, as much as one would add at the table. 

Potato on the half shell carries serving one step farther. 
Cut the baked potatoes in two lengthwise, remove the con- 
tents, mash lightly, add butter or butterine, milk, and salt, al- 
lowing a teaspoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of milk and a 
shake or two of salt to each potato. These measurements can- 
not be given with exactness, because potatoes vary in size. Beat 
this mixture well, replace lightly in each half shell, and brown 
the tops slightly. This is nothing more than mashed baked 
potato, prettily served. 

Invent other variations of this dish, adding ingredients that 
are agreeable when mixed with the potato. The beaten white 
of an egg added, gives greater lightness to the mixture in the 
potato shell. 

Method 2. The same as Method 1, except that the potatoes 
are pared before baking. A good method when the skins are 
not fair. A brown crust is formed on the potato, which is 
crisp and pleasant to eat. Large potatoes may be cut in two 
before baking, or even sliced. 

What difference in length of baking will there be between 
Methods 1 and 2 ? 

2. Boiled potatoes. 

The only way to prevent the loss of nutrients in using this 
process is to boil the potatoes with the " jackets " on. This 
is the best way with new potatoes. This method with ripe 
and old potatoes gives a yellowish color to the surface and 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 119 

indeed throughout. It is a labor-saving method for the busy 
housewife, as the skin cracks and loosens at the end of the 
boiling process, and is easily removed. 

If you choose to have a snow-white potato, it must be pared 
before boiling, and thus you deliberately waste the valuable 
mineral matter provided by nature. If your income permits 
this aesthetic pleasure, the mineral matter can of course be 
supplied in other vegetables. The woman who can spend but 
twenty to thirty cents per capita for food per day should boil 
the potatoes with the skins on and gratify her artistic sense in 
some other way. 

The method of boiling is the same in either case, whether the 
potato is pared or not. 

Have enough boiling water to cover the potatoes. Put the 
potatoes of uniform size one at a time into the kettle that 
the boiling may not stop. Allow a gentle boiling to continue 
until the potatoes are done. Why avoid rapid boiling? Test 
with a fork at the end of half an hour. When the potatoes 
are mellow, drain off the water, and set the kettle where the 
remaining moisture will steam off. Shake gently to hasten 
this process, and sprinkle the potatoes with salt. If they must 
stand before serving will you place a tin cover or a cloth over 
the kettle ? Old potatoes, with a strong flavor, should be pared 
before boiling, or even soaked in cold water. 

Mashed potatoes. Some one devised this convenient method of 
serving, to save trouble at the table. Mashed potato can be 
very poor and unappetizing when wet and lumpy. Do not at- 
tempt it with new, poor, or old potatoes. See that the boiled 
potatoes are as dry as can be every particle of water steamed 
away. Mash thoroughly with the wire masher, add butter or 
butterine, salt and milk in about the proportions given for potato 
in the hah 3 shell. Use a tablespoonful or so of cream if it is avail- 
able. Beat vigorously. The mealiness of the potato and the 
vigorous beating are the secrets of success. The finished product 
should be light and somewhat moist, not wet. Reheat in the 
kettle. Pile lightly in a hot dish and serve ; or brown the top 
before serving. 

Potato puff. (Souffle.) With your knowledge of mashed 
potato, can you not invent a potato puff ? 



120 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

4. Escalloped potato. The name escalloped is applied to any 

baked dish that is arranged in layers. Escalloped potato 
is a palatable dish and this is one of the most economical of 
methods. 

Wash, pare, and slice the potatoes in Hnch pieces. Slightly 
grease an earthen or enameled baking dish. Cover the bottom 
of the dish with a layer of the slices, sprinkle the slices lightly 
with flour, and put on two teaspoonfuls of butter, or butterine, 
in small bits. Continue until the dish is nearly full. Pour 
in milk to barely cover the potatoes, put a cover on the dish 
and set the dish in an oven of 380 F. Remove the cover in 
time to allow the top to brown. Allow rather more than half 
an hour for the baking. 

5. Creamed potatoes. Method 1, an easy way. Chop cold baked 

potatoes with the chopper. Allow one tablespoonful of butter 
to 1 pint of chopped potato. Melt the butter in a saucepan. 
Stir in the potatoes. Shake from the dredger the equiva- 
lent of a tablespoonful of flour, stirring the potato with one 
hand as you shake with the other. Pour in enough milk to 
barely cover the chopped potato. Set the saucepan in the 
coolest spot on the range ; or on the simmering burner of a gas 
range, upon an asbestos mat; or turn all into an earthen- 
ware jar, or baking dish, and proceed as with escalloped potato. 
Allow the mixture to cook until it becomes creamy. 

Method 2. Cut the cold potatoes in cubes, and heat in a 
thin white sauce. See Chapter X. 

Boiled potatoes may be used, but baked are better in tex- 
ture and flavor for creaming. 

6. French fried potatoes. Wash and pare small potatoes, cut in 

eighths lengthwise, and soak a few minutes in cold water. 
Take from water, dry between towels, and fry in deep fat. 
Drain on brown paper and sprinkle with salt. 

(1) Deep fat frying. An iron kettle is the best for deep 
fat, 3 quarts a convenient size. A wire basket is almost neces- 
sary for frying soft material. 

Fill the kettle | full of fat and place over fire. When a 
slight blue smoke or vapor rises from it, it is ready to test. 
Test with small cubes of bread. If bread browns in 1 minute, 
the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures. If it browns 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 121 

in 10 seconds, it is right for cooked materials. Care must be 
taken to keep the temperatures at the right point, for if too cool, 
the material will soak fat ; if too hot, both fat and material to 
be cooked will burn. 

(2) To clarify fat. Drop several slices raw, pared potato 
into the fat and let bubble up. Strain all through cheesecloth 
back into pail from which fat was taken. The potatoes seem 
to absorb food odors and collect crumbs and leave the fat 
clear. 

7. Stewed celery. A green vegetable. Stalks of celery, too 

tough or coarse for serving uncooked, are delicious when 
stewed. The process is simple. Wash, scrape, and cut the 
stalks crosswise. Place them in a stewpan, barely cover with 
hot water, adding a teaspoonful of salt to a pint of celery. 
Cook gently for half an hour or until the celery is tender. Use 
the liquid remaining in making a sauce, adding some milk 
to make the necessary amount of liquid. Three fourths of a cup 
of sauce is enough for a pint of celery. See Chapter X. 

8. Cabbage. The method given makes cabbage a delicious and 

attractive vegetable, as delicate as cauliflower, and the odor 
in the kitchen is not noticeable. 

Select a small cabbage, with the ribs in the leaves not too 
thick. Prepare the cabbage before washing it by cutting out 
the stalks from below with a sharp knife. Separate the leaves. 
Have ready the largest kettle available, nearly full of rapidly 
boiling water. Drop in one cabbage leaf at a time, pressing 
each one down with a long-handled spoon or skimmer. Do 
this so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. Leave the 
kettle uncovered, and allow the cabbage to cook from 12 to 
15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the leaf stalks. 
Remove the leaves with a long-handled skimmer, putting them 
into a colander standing on a plate. Immediately pour the hot 
water down the sink drain, turn on the cold water to flush 
away the odor, and fill the kettle with cold water. While 
the cabbage is cooking, you have made a pint of white sauce, 
No. 2 (Ch. X), adding a teaspoonful of salt, and have prepared 
\ cup of buttered crumbs. Cut the cabbage leaves slightly, 
place them in a baking dish, pour the white sauce over them, 
sprinkle the crumbs on the top, and brown the crumbs in the 



122 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

oven or under the gas. If you can, prepare this as a surprise 
at home, and ask the family to " guess " what it is. If the 
cabbage is a good one, some of the leaves turn a very pretty 
green with this method of boiling. 

9. Baked beans. A nitrogenous vegetable and a meat substi- 
tute. A dish known in old days in New England, baked 
to perfection in the old brick oven. Baked beans seem diffi- 
cult of digestion for some people. The mustard is supposed 
to be helpful, and adds something to the flavor. If the mo- 
lasses is omitted, or but a small amount used, and if butter 
takes the place of pork or suet, the beans seem more digestible. 
In different parts of New England the dish is varied. Some 
people prefer rather dry baked beans, others wish them moist 
and very sweet. 

Utensils. A kettle. A covered bean pot. 
Ingredients. 1 quart of white beans. 
1 teaspoonful of soda, 
j Ib. salt pork or more, or 
4 tablespoonfuls of beef fat or butter sub- 
stitute. 
Molasses, from two tablespoonfuls to \ cup, 

or none. 

1 teaspoonful of mustard. 

Method. Wash, and soak the beans in cold water over 
night. Pour off any water that remains. Put the beans into 
the kettle, cover with cold water, add the soda, and cook gently 
until the beans are slightly softened. The soda aids the soften- 
ing. Pour off the water again, and put the beans into the 
pot. Mix the molasses and mustard with a pint of water, and 
pour this over the beans, adding more water if the beans are 
not covered. Place the pork or other fat upon the beans, and 
cover the pot. If fat other than pork is used, salt must be 
added to the beans. The beans should bake slowly, i ? or from 
6 to 8 hours, and even longer in a very slow oven. A stove 
of the type shown in Fig. 17 is good for this purpose. They 



Laboratory management. The last experiment is the only one not easily 
performed in the school kitchen. The process can begin perhaps on one day, 
and be finished the next. If there is some apparatus that cooks at a lav) 
temperature, the practical difficulties may be overcome. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETABLE COOKERY 123 

can be baked in the ordinary gas oven, if only one burner is 
used, and that is turned very low. 

Vegetable, or " cream " soups. 

These are of two classes: the purees (porridge), or thick soups, 
with vegetable pulp as the thickening material, and the cream 
soups, which are somewhat thinner, the juices of some vegetable 
giving the flavor. 

Potato puree, or soup, is an example of the first; cream of 
tomato of the second. The line is not sharply drawn between the 
two in many cook books. Milk is an important ingredient in these 
soups, so that they are sometimes known as milk soups. Butter and 
flour are used in both, the flour in the puree " binds " the 
mixture and makes it smoother; in the cream soup the flour is 
used for thickening as well. 

Dried beans, peas, or lentils make a delicious puree, the secret of 
success being long slow cooking in some low temperature appa- 
ratus. They are brought to perfection in the Atkinson Cooker. 

10. Potato Puree. 



Ingredients. 
Potato 
Milk 
Flour 
Butter 



Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 



Celery stalks, cut small 
Onion, chopped 



cup 

quart 

tablespoonful 

tablespoonful 



teaspoonful 
tablespoonful 



Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks. If a thicker puree is desired, use more of the 
mashed potato. If celery salt is used, omit one teaspoonful 
of the salt. Less onion may be used, and the pepper omitted. 

Utensils. Make the list yourself, after reading the direc- 
tions for mixing. 

Method of mixing. Boil and mash the potato, or use cold 
mashed potato. Heat the milk in the double boiler with the 
celery and onion. Add the milk gradually to the mashed po- 
tato, beating vigorously. 

Put this mixture through a strainer into the double boiler, 



124 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and reheat it. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, or stir in 
the flour, add slowly half a cup of the soup to the butter and 
flour paste, and then pour this slowly into the mixture in the 
double boiler, stirring all the time. The soup will be ready to 
serve in about ten minutes. 

The important point in this recipe is the quality of the 
mashed potato. It should be dry and light. It may be made 
from hot, mealy baked potatoes. If cold mashed potato is 
used, this should be made light again with a fork. An excel- 
lent luncheon dish. Will serve four to six people. 

ii. Cream of tomato soup. 

Ingredients. 

Tomato juice I cup 

Milk 1 quart 

Flour 2 tablespoonfuls 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt 2 teaspoonfuls 

Bicarbonate of soda \ teaspoonful 

Pepper, Cayenne To taste. 

Remarks. Celery and onion may be added, but are not 
necessary. When you become expert, you will be able to 
use a larger amount of tomato juice, and even omit the soda. 

Method of mixing. This you will be able to work out for 
yourself. First perform this simple experiment. Stir together 
a tablespoonful of stewed tomato and a tablespoonful of milk. 
What happens? Heat this mixture. What further do you 
notice ? How may you best extract the juice from the tomato ? 
You have noticed the effect of the acid tomato upon the 
milk. The soda is added to partly counteract this effect. 
Will you stir the soda into the tomato juice or into the milk? 
Will you stir the tomato juice into the milk, or the milk into 
the tomato juice? Will you cook the mixture at all? How 
long before serving will you mix the two? When will you 
add the butter and flour? 



Laboratory management. An individual portion of soup n:ay be made

CHAPTER VIII 
CEREAL PRODUCTS 

THE common grains, sometimes called cereals, 1 yield some 
of the most important of all the food materials. Those most 
widely used are wheat, maize, or Indian corn, oats, rice, 
barley, rye, and millet. In this country wheat and corn are 
the two great crops upon which our prosperity largely de- 
pends, and a shortage in one of these crops is felt in the busi- 
ness world, not only in this country, but abroad. Rice is 
the important cereal in China, Japan, and India, and a 
failure of the rice crop may mean famine to millions of people, 
especially in India. These facts are mentioned to show that 
the race has learned to depend upon the grains as a staple 
food, and a study of their composition proves that this 
common habit is founded in reason. The grains are all 
members of the grass family, and the edible portion is the 
seed. From these seeds are manufactured pure starch, 
breakfast cereals, meal, and flour. Like beans and peas, 
these seeds are the storehouses of food for the young plants, 
and we therefore find the high nutritive value depicted in 
Fig. 37. Notice that the carbohydrate (starch) content is 
high in all ; that all contain protein, oats, wheat, and rye 
being about equal in this and higher than the others ; oats 
are highest in fat, corn ranking next. The ash contains the 
same important mineral substances that we found in the 
fruits, the percentages of each differing somewhat with the

the Roman goddess of agriculture.

different grains and being quite different for the cereals as a 
class than for the fruits and vegetables as a class. It must 
be remembered that these percentages are given for the 
whole grain, and that the amounts of the nutrients in the 
manufactured product depend upon the process employed. 

Manufacture of cereal food materials. 1 The primitive 
method of making the material in the grain available for use 
was by grinding the grain between two stones, or by pound- 
ing one stone upon another, and this method is used by the 
Mexicans and certain of the American Indians to this day, 
human muscle being the power employed. Wind and water 
were harnessed for grinding grain, and were the only motive 
powers available until the invention of steam, the grinding 
being done by stones. In a Connecticut town there still 
exists a mill stone, one of a pair so small that they were 
carried into the settlement on horseback, and when placed in 
a small mill by a brook, they ground a bushel of corn in a day. 

Breakfast cereals and meal are now made in the great 
factories that produce flour ; steam is the motive power and 
the grains are broken, or rolled, between steel rollers. (See 
Chapter XII.) 

Breakfast cereals. The ready-to-eat breakfast cereal 
has met the popular demand for a quickly prepared food for 
the first meal of the day. A few of these are made under 
known conditions, but they are sometimes manufactured 
from inferior grain, and the presence of grit at times indi- 
cates a possible lack of cleanliness in the process. It is a 
question, too, whether or not the starch has been subjected 
to heat for a sufficient length of time, and whether they can 
be masticated sufficiently to make the grain digestible, 
and the nutritive material available. Their use for young 
children is undesirable. For older people, they add variety 

1 The manufacture of flour is discussed in the chapter on bread making. 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 129 

to the diet, but they are usually more expensive than the 
home-cooked breakfast foods, even when the cost of fuel is 
taken into account. See Fig. 38. 

Cooked breakfast cereals. It is an easy task to cook a 
cereal, especially now that the fireless cooker in some form 
is present in so many homes. The cereal for breakfast does 
not necessitate early rising ; as it may be prepared the day or 
evening before and be served in palatable form in the morning. 

The most common breakfast cereals are made from oats, 
wheat, and corn, varying in fineness of grain from those 
ground like a meal to the coarser cracked wheat and the 
samp made from corn. It is well to use kinds made from 
different grains, but when the worth of a few has been proved, 
it is not wise to try another kind simply because it has a new 
label. One manufacturer confessed to a visitor that the 
same cereal was put into boxes of different colors and sold 
under different names as a means of inviting purchasers. 
The cereal foods made from whole grains are especially 
valuable on account of the high mineral content. 

It usually pays to buy in boxes, rather than in bulk, in 
the case of cereals; and always from a reliable grocer. If 
you purchase a box of cereal as a " bargain," weigh its con- 
tents and compare the weight with the weight of a box 
bought in the regular way. Also examine such a box for 
the presence of insects. These may be recognized some- 
times by a webby substance, and again the insects themselves 
may be detected. Do not buy too large a stock of cereals, 
since they are better when they are fresh from the factory, 
and a good firm renews its stock often. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 1. Softening of the fiber by long-con- 
tinued low temperature with a supply of water present.

2. Complete opening of the starch granules by the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

3. The protein present presents no special problem. Its diges- 
tibility is not especially affected, but the softening of the fiber of 
the cereal makes the protein available to us. 

Methods. There are two classes into which the cereals may be 
divided, the flaked and the granular. The weighing experi- 
ments (page 62) show that the granular is the heavier. This means 
that more water \rill be absorbed by a given measure of the granular, 
because it contains more material. 

In experimenting with a cereal at home it is well to try the 
proportion of water and cereal printed on the box the first time, 
altering the proportion if the first result is not satisfactory. There 
should be enough water to soften the cereal, and only just enough. 
If the cooked cereal is stiff, the measure of water is short; if so 
thin that the cereal runs on the plate, too much water was allowed. 

i. Preparation of breakfast cereal. 

Ingredients. 

1 part, by measure, flaked cereal to 2 of water. 

1 part granular cereal to 3 to 4 of water. 

1 cup of dry cereal will serve three or four people. 

Samp, cracked wheat, and coarse corn meal will take from 

4 to 6 parts of water. 

Salt. A tablespoonful to a quart of water is an average 
amount. 

Utensils : a measuring cup ; a double boiler ; a fork. 

Method. Measure the cereal and water, put the water into the 
inner part of the double boiler with the salt. Have the 
lower part of the boiler ready about half full of hot water ; 
place the inner boiler directly upon the stove or over the flame. 
When the water is boiling rapidly, shake the cereal into the water 
from a cup, so slowly that the water does not stop boiling. This 
is the first secret of a well-cooked cereal. The rapidly boiling 
water keeps the grains of cereal in motion, and thus they do 
not stick to the vessel nor to each other, and the heat reaches 
the starch in the grains equally. If the grains begin to settle, 
shake the vessel gently, but do not stir, even with a fork. 
Allow this process to continue for about five minutes, or until 
you see a thickening of the mass, so much so that the separate 



132 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

grains do not settle. If toward the end of this stage there is 
danger of sticking, lift the mass with the fork, but do not stir 
it, as this motion will break the grains. This first process 
opens the starch grains. Place the inner part of the boiler 
in the outer over boiling water and allow the cooking to con- 
tinue for at least one hour. For this is the second secret of the 
perfect cereal, a long-continued process that softens the 
fiber and develops flavor. One cereal, advertised as being 
cooked in three minutes, remains unpalatable after that length 
of time, but is delicious at the end of two hours. If you have a 
fireless cooker, put the cereal in the double boiler into the 
cooker overnight for the second stage. Any low temperature 
apparatus gives the desired result. 

2. The uses of cold cereal. Never throw away cooked cereals. 

The cold cereal is useful in many ways. 

(a) Mold in small cups with dates or other fruit, and serve 
with sugar and cream for luncheon. 

(6) Cool corn meal mush in a flat dish, cut it in slices when 
cold, and brown the slices in a frying pan, with beef fat, or 
a butter substitute. Serve with sugar, molasses, or sirup for 
breakfast or luncheon. 

(c) Rice or hominy may be mixed with a beaten egg, molded 
into small cakes, and browned either in the frying pan, or 
in the oven. 

(d) A small remaining portion of any cereal may be used to 
thicken soup. 

(e) Any cooked cereal may be used in muffins or even yeast 
bread. (See those chapters.) 

3. Corn meal "mush." This is cooked by the same method as 

the other cereals, except that the amount of water is larger 
and the first boiling should continue longer. The meal must 
be scattered slowly into the boiling water, or else be mixed 
first with cold water, as it lumps very easily. The second stage 
of the process should continue several hours. 

Rice. Rice varies very much in quality and in the shape 
of the grain. Louisiana and Chinese rice are among those 
that have a firm and large grain keeping its shape well when 



CEREAL PRODUCTS 133 

cooked. Inferior varieties become too soft, and the finished 
product is pasty and poor in color and flavor. Much is said 
at present about the harmful effect of the polishing process 
upon the quality of the rice. An unpolished rice may some- 
times be found on the market, brownish in color and with a 
good flavor. 

4. Boiled rice. Rice may be cooked in the double boiler by the 
same method as other cereals, allowing 1 part of rice to 3 of 
water. The rice should be well washed in cold water. 

The second stage need not be continued so long, from three 
quarters of an hour to an hour being sufficient. The flavor is 
improved by the use of milk in place of hah* of the water. By 
this method the nutritive value is much increased. 

Another method used by the Chinese continues the boiling 
throughout the whole process. A very large amount of water 
is used, several quarts for one cup of rice, and when the water 
is boiling violently the rice is scattered in very slowly. The 
boiling continues from twenty minutes to half an hour, or until 
the grains are tender, and then the water is drained off, through 
a colander. The rice in the colander should then be placed 
where the remaining moisture will steam off. By this method 
nutrients are lost, but the grains of the rice stand out dis- 
tinctly and are light and dry. It is a difficult method for the 
novice, because its success depends upon the removal of the 
rice from the water just at the moment it is tender, but not too 
soft. The grains should be tested in twenty minutes. 

Corn products. Corn being our most abundant grain, it 
is the cheapest, and we should promote its use. Hominy 
and samp and Indian meal, when well cooked, are all most 
palatable. There is a difference between old and new pro- 
cess corn meal, to be noticed in the flavor and in the behavior 
of the two kinds in cooking. The new process meal now more 
largely on the market has been deprived of the germ, which 
contains a large amount of oil, and although the meal does 
not deteriorate so soon, there is some loss of flavor. More- 



134 - FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over, when the new process meal is used in an old-time 
recipe, more wetting must be used than the recipe calls for 
and a larger amount of fat. 

The old process of grinding between stones is still employed 
in some localities. Southern and Rhode Island corn meal 
are ground in this way, and may be found at some groceries. 
There are also two colors, the yellow and the white, each with 
a distinctive flavor, and some people who think they dislike 
corn meal find the white meal agreeable. 

Pure starches. These occur as food materials in several 
forms. Cornstarch is the starchy portion only removed 
from the grain of corn. Wheat starch is more largely used 
for laundry purposes than for food. Rice flour may be 
treated as starch in cooking. Arrowroot is a fine starch 
from the roots of a family of plants growing in the West 
Indies and other warm climates. It is used principally in 
cooking for invalids. Cassava, manioca, tapioca, and sago 
are starchy materials in granular form. The first three are 
made from the pith of the cassava plant, the sago from the 
sago palm. The pure starches are all easily digested and 
inexpensive. Corn starch is the most abundant and cheap- 
est pure starch in this country. 

The starch granule. To understand the behavior of 
materials like cornstarch, rice flour, and arrowroot in cook- 
ing, we need to know more of the starch grain. Cornstarch 
is composed of myriads of tiny granules somewhat like those 
pictured in Fig. 39, but smaller. The starch granules of dif- 
ferent plants differ in size and even in shape, but they all 
have a covering lying in folds, the pure starch being within. 
The granule unfolds or bursts when exposed to heat. When 
these granules are floating in water, and, being heated, open 
at the same moment, the starch paste is smooth ; otherwise, 
the starch lumps.

A. Starch experiments. 

Starch turns a characteristic blue color in the presence of iodine. 
This is an unfailing starch, test, but must be used in the cold. 

1. Grate a piece of potato into a small amount of water, and 
strain out the pulp. The starch settles from the water in a few 
minutes. Pour off the water, and add a drop of diluted iodine to 
the remaining starch. If a microscope is available, dilute this 
mixture and with a dropper tube place a drop upon a slide. The

Why are 3 and 4 similar in result, and different from 2 ? 

Desserts from the starches. Cornstarch, in particular, is 
often disliked, because it is undercooked, and too large a 
proportion is used. It may be made very palatable, and is 
too valuable in cooking and too inexpensive to be discarded.

5. Chocolate cornstarch. 

Milk 1 pint 

Cornstarch 3 tablespoonfuls, level 

Cocoa (Baker's) 3 tablespoonfuls, level 

Sugar cup 

Salt | teaspoonful 

Vanilla 1 teaspoonful 

What utensils? You should be able to plan the method of 
mixing. The milk must be heated in a double boiler. Which 
method of mixing in the cornstarch will you use ? How can 
you best add the cocoa, sugar, and salt? The vanilla? 

It is difficult to boil milk directly over the fire or flame, 
without scorching it. Since the starch cannot well be exposed 
to the boiling temperature in this case, the process must con- 
tinue in the double boiler until the mixture has thickened well, 
for at least half an hour, three quarters being better. When 
the cooking is finished, pour the mixture into molds which have 
been wet in cold water. When the mixture is cooled, chill it 
in the refrigerator. Serve with cream or milk and sugar for 
those who may want it sweeter. This gives a soft mold, that 
is much more palatable than one so stiff that it has a firm shape. 
This will serve four or five people. 

6. Tapioca and sago. These materials make delicious desserts 

with fruit. They are also used with eggs and milk. (See 
Chapter XV.) 

Macaroni, spaghetti, and vermicelli are valuable cereal 
products made from flour, this form of cereal food having 
originated in Italy. The Italians manufacture the paste in 
a large variety of forms, and some of the small fancy shapes 
are also used in soup. The composition of macaroni is shown 
in Fig. 51. It is a valuable material, and when served or 
cooked with cheese may well be the main dish of a home 
luncheon.

bake in hot oven until crumbs are brown. Some prefer to 
omit the crumbs and have a thick layer of the cheese on top 
which becomes crisp and brown. Boiled macaroni and spa- 
ghetti may be served with tomato sauce and a little grated cheese 
This is called " Italian style."

CHAPTER IX 
EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 

EGGS are a specially interesting food because they contain 
all the elements necessary to the development of the young 
chick within the shell. The structure of the egg is familiar, 
with its division into the yolk and white, and it is interesting 
to note the details of this structure. 

Break a fresh egg carefully into a saucer. The shell is 
porous, allowing water to evaporate from the egg and air 
to enter. To this porosity is due the fact that other sub- 
stances may enter the egg, giving it an unnatural flavor and 
even hastening its deterioration. Within the shell is a fine 
membrane which protects the white. The yolk is also di- 
vided from the white by a more delicate membrane which 
enables one to separate the yolk from the white of a fresh 
egg. A careful examination reveals at each end of the yolk 
a continuation of this membrane in the form of small cords 
which are fastened at each end of the shell, holding the yolk 
evenly suspended in the center of the shell. Rough handling 
or jolting breaks this membrane, and the yolk drops to one 
side. 

Lift the white carefully with a fork, and notice its elas- 
ticity. This cohesive property makes it possible to beat air 
into the white until the whole mass become porous. The 
yolk is creamy rather than light when beaten, and a bit of 
the yolk mixed with the white prevents the latter from be- 
coming light and dry.

FIG. 40. Composition of eggs and cheese. 



140 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Composition of the egg. Figure 40 gives the composition 
of the yolk and white taken together, and of the yolk and 
white separated. The protein content is high, and the fat 
content as well, the yolk containing a higher percentage of 
these two foodstuffs than the white. The mineral matter is 
of high value, iron and phosphorus being found in ideal 
forms in the yolk. In using the egg as food we are availing 
ourselves of one of nature's richest storehouses. A single 
egg of average size yields about 75 calories, of which 60 come 
from the yolk and 15 from the white. A very large egg, 
weighing two and two thirds ounces, will yield 100 calories. 

Fresh eggs and cold storage eggs. The fresh-laid egg is 
always desired for its delicious flavor, and this flavor changes 
but little in a week or two if the egg is kept cool. It is de- 
sirable to preserve eggs, however, for future use at the season 
when they are most abundant and cheap. Many methods 
have been tried, such as laying them away in sawdust, sink- 
ing them in water-glass solution, or coating the shell with 
paraffin or some other substance to prevent evaporation and 
the entrance of air. The introduction of cold storage on a 
large scale promises a solution of the problem. If eggs are 
fresh when placed in storage, it is possible to keep them 
just above the freezing temperature for months without 
appreciable deterioration. 

Eggs too long in storage may be detected by the musty 
odor and flavor, the running of the yolk into the white, and 
the thin quality of the white which prevents beating stiff. 
Some states have already passed stringent laws in regard to 
the sale of cold storage eggs. 

The cost of eggs and how to buy. The demand for fresh 
eggs is great, and so many eggs are exported, that the price is 
high, even in the summer. Twenty-five cents a dozen is a 
reasonable price, but this is below the average at the present 



. EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 141 

date. The thirty-five or forty-cent daily allowance for food 
will permit the moderate use of eggs at thirty-five cents a 
dozen, but not a liberal use in cakes and desserts. They 
should be used at such a price and with that allowance as 
the main dish for breakfast or luncheon at times, and not 
in sweet dishes calling for three or four eggs. If a recipe 
for soft custard calls for three eggs to a pint of milk, leave 
out one egg or even two, and use one or two tablespoonf uls 
of cornstarch instead. Select eggs with a hard shell, and 
yolk of rich yellow. If the shell is soft and the yolk pale, 
these deficiences should be reported, as they can be corrected 
by the poultryman. The difference in color of the shells, 
whether white or brown, is not of great consequence. If you 
can buy eggs by the crate direct from the poultryman, this 
is a saving, provided the eggs can be used before they de- 
teriorate. A small, crate holds fifteen dozen ; the usual size 
thirty dozen. Some express companies have a special rate 
for eggs, and parcel post should aid in this method of buying. 
Relative digestibility of soft and hard cooked eggs. The 
fact must be recalled that to digest is to dissolve, and that 
the digestion of food means a dissolving by the digestive 
juices, aided by water. When we speak of the digestibility 
of food we may mean the ease and comfort of digestion, or 
the length of time taken by the process, or the completeness 
of the process. If we take the third of these meanings, hard- 
cooked egg is as digestible as the soft-cooked or the raw egg, 
because it is completely dissolved in digestion in the course 
of time. If the second meaning of digestion is taken, the 
hard-cooked egg may be slightly less digestible, for a slightly 
longer time is consumed in the process. The latest researches, 
however, show that the digestive process is longer with any 
food than was formerly supposed, and the difference in this 
case is not especially important. Indeed, we must accept 



142 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the conclusions of the scientist and frankly admit that the 
differences of temperature in cooking of egg do not have any 
great effect upon its digestibility. 

Why then the popular idea that a hard-boiled egg is " ab- 
solutely indigestible " ? A hard boiled egg, or more than one, 
eaten rapidly, without mastication, at a picnic, and with 
much sweet food at an unusual hour, may interfere with the 
" ease and comfort in digestion " resulting from such a meal. 
But if the i whites of the hard-boiled eggs are chopped fine, 
the yolk mashed, and the two served upon toast, thus insur- 
ing mastication, a dish is produced that is of average diges- 
tibility and that may be used for breakfast or luncheon with- 
out hesitation. 

If a tender, jellylike consistency is wanted, cook the egg 
below the boiling point of water. If, however, a firmer egg 
is preferred, use the old time method, and cook the egg three 
or four minutes in boiling water. It is the easier and quicker 
method. 

Moreover, do not hesitate to use an egg " boiled " half an 
hour, provided it is chopped fine or sliced.

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

1. Eggs used raw. An egg, swallowed whole, followed by a cracker, 

is a " quick lunch " that is not harmful, and it is sometimes 
convenient to be able to take an egg in this way. A sprinkling 
of salt upon it makes it more agreeable. 

2. Beaten eggs. Beat the yolk and white separately. Add to 

the yolk a teaspoonful of sugar, a shake of salt, some flavor- 
ing, and f of a cup of milk. Beat the white gently into this 
mixture and serve in a glass. The flavoring may be a quarter 
of a teaspoonful of vanilla, or a tablespoonful of orange juice. 
This is sometimes served to an invalid who can take milk, and 
is an agreeable luncheon for any one. If milk does not agree 
with one, a larger amount of fruit juice may be used with the 
addition of some water, possibly carbonated. The white 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 143 

alone is given in cases of severe illness, mixed with a small 
amount of water, and fruit juice if the physician permits the 
latter. This is sometimes the only food that can be retained 
by an invalid. 

Principles of egg cookery. Protein in the form of an egg-albumin 
is the foodstuff to consider in the cooking of eggs. Heat produces 
in the egg a change in color and in texture or firmness, the firmness 
or hardness depending upon the degree of heat and the length of 
time given to the cooking. Coagulation is the term used for this 
change in the egg-albumin. 

1. The white of egg begins to coagulate and to show an opaque 
white at about 180 F. 

2. A temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water 
for about ten minutes will give the white a jellylike, tender con- 
sistency, and slightly cook the yolk. Continued for an hour, the 
white becomes solid and adheres to the shell. 

3. The boiling point of water gives a firmer consistency than a 
temperature below this point. The white is free from the shell. 

4. A high temperature, that of a hot pan, will produce a leathery 
consistency if long continued. 

A. An experiment with the egg. 

Apparatus and materials. A ring stand, wire net, Bunsen burner, 
glass beaker, test tube, chemical thermometer, white of egg. 

Method. Put the beaker two thirds full of water on the wire 
net over the flame. Put enough white of egg into the test tube to 
cover the bulb of the thermometer when this is put into the tube. 
Clamp the test tube so that it rests in the water in the beaker. 
The surface of the water should stand above the top of the white of 
egg. Clamp the thermometer so that it is held in the white of egg 
in the test tube. The white should be stirred with a fork before 
it is put into the test tube, and only a small quantity used. 

Note : 1. The temperature when the first visible change occurs. 

2. The temperature when the whole mass becomes of a 

jellylike consistency. 

3. The temperature when the water reaches the boiling 

point. Remove ; note the consistency. 

3. Jellied or coddled eggs. See that the shells are whole and clean. 
If the eggs are just taken from the refrigerator, lay them in 



144 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

warm water a few minutes. Make ready a double boiler, the 
lower part half full of boiling water. Put the required number 
of eggs into the inner boiler, cover with water that has just 
stopped boiling, put on the boiler cover, and stand the boiler 
where the water below will no longer boil. The eggs will be 
done in from six to eight minutes. 

Having performed the preceding experiment, you should be 
able to invent another way of accomplishing this result. 

4. Boiled eggs. Put one egg at a time from a tablespoon in- 

to boiling water. Allow the water to boil for three or four 
minutes, depending upon the preference of those served. 
Remove the eggs, and serve at once. 

The hard-boiled egg should remain in the boiling water half 
an hour. 

Bearing in 'mind the fact that hard-boiled eggs must be 
chopped or sliced, cannot you invent a way of using them in a 
luncheon dish? 

5. Poached eggs. Make ready a frying pan by setting muffin 

rings in it, and filling it about half full of gently simmering 
water, with a teaspoonful of salt dissolved in it. Break the 
eggs one at a time into a saucer, and slip each egg carefully into 
a muffin ring. See that the pan stands where the water is just 
below the boiling point, for rapidly bubbling water breaks the 
eggs. When the white begins to set, pour the hot water 
gently over the tops of the eggs from a spoon. Cook until the 
white is firm. Slip a griddle cake turner under the egg, lift 
it gently, and place it upon a piece of buttered toast which 
you have ready on a hot plate, or platter, and remove the ring. 
An easier method resembling the poached egg is to break 
the egg raw into a small buttered cup or " patty," standing the 
cups in a pan of water just below the boiling point, the pan 
being on the top of the stove or in the oven. Each egg should 
have a sprinkling of salt, and may have a bit of butter, and a 
shake of pepper. Cover the pan. This process is longer than 
the other, and the eggs must be watched to see when the 
process is complete. 

6. Scrambled eggs. As the name denotes, this is a process needing 

a quick motion. Allow an egg to each person. Have ready 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 145 

a frying pan heated, a broad bladed knife, and a tablespoonful 
of butter, or butter substitute, ready to melt in the pan. 

(1) Melt the butter, break the eggs into the pan, without 
beating them, and begin to scrape them from the bottom of 
the pan with the knife, as fast as you can move your hand. 
This is an old-time method, and gives a mixture of white and 
yellow color. Stop the process when the eggs are softer than 
you wish them for serving, as they will stiffen after they are 
removed from the fire. Sprinkle in salt, before you give 
the last scramble, and serve at once. 

(2) Beat the eggs, adding a tablespoonful of water for each 
egg, and a shake of salt for each, and proceed as in (1). 

7. The omelet. The novice should see an omelet made, as there 
is a " knack/' in the motion not to be conveyed by words. 
The omelet is a French dish, and is made to perfection by the 
French cook. A perfect omelet is rolled or folded over, and is 
creamy within and a golden brown without. " Omelet pans " 
are made for the purpose, but a small frying pan may be used. 
The pan should be perfectly smooth. Do not attempt to 
make an omelet with more than two eggs until you become 
expert. This is one method, and others are used by different 
French cooks. The first stage makes the whole mass creamy, 
the second browns one surface. 

(1) Have the pan warm enough to melt two teaspoonfuls of 
butter, but not hot. Beat two eggs with a fork until they are 
creamy but not foamy, and add two teaspoonfuls of water, 
with two shakes of salt. 

Put the mixture into the pan, standing the pan where it 
has a medium heat. If over gas, the flame should be low, and 
covered with asbestos. Proceed as with the scrambled egg, 
with great rapidity, and when the mass is creamy, lift the pan, 
tip it slightly, and push the whole mass toward the handle end 
of the pan. Put two teaspoonfuls more of butter in the pan,, 
and set it where the heat is intense. Smooth the mass of egg 
over the whole surface of the pan that the omelet may become 
brown underneath. Shake the pan gently back and forth, lift 
the omelet at the edge with a knife to see if the browning is 
accomplished, take the pan from the fire, fold or roll the omelet 
from the handle end of the pan to the front, and turn it out 
upon a hot plate. 
L 



146 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A method easier for the novice is to accomplish the first 
stage in a bowl set into a teakettle, beating into the mass as 
it thickens a teaspoonful of butter, or a tablespoonful of 
cream. When the mixture is evenly creamy, turn it into the 
hot buttered pan and proceed as with (1). 

(2) Light omelet. This is not a true omelet, but in reality 
a souffle cooked in a frying pan. It is somewhat insipid in 
flavor and is not easier to make well than the French omelet. 
As commonly served it is apt to be underdone or tough. 

With the light omelet, the eggs and whites are separated and 
the whites beaten until light and dry. Beat the yolks until 
creamy, adding water and salt as in (1). Pour this mixture 
over the white, and cut and fold the mass. See page 63. 
Pour this into a buttered baking dish and set in a moderate 
oven. The oven should not be more than 300 F. Serve in 
the pan. 

When gas is used, the souffle may be set in the oven with 
the flame low, and browned for a moment under the flame 
turned high. 

Both of these omelets may be varied by the addition of 
chopped parsley or chopped ham, or grated cheese. 



Laboratory management. When the price of eggs is high, some of th 
experiments can be demonstrated by the teacher. Eggs should be used 
when the price is at its lowest, even if this interferes with the logical se- 
quence of lessons. 

MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 

Milk is the natural food of the young mammal, and con- 
tains all the foodstuffs in a form easily assimilable. Starch 
is not present, the carbohydrate being found in the form of 
'lactose, or milk sugar, a sugar differing somewhat from the 
sugars found in vegetables and fruit (see Chapter X). 

Whole milk and the milk products, cream, butter, and 
cheese, are all important food materials among the nations 
of the western world ; and the manufacture of milk products, 
such as condensed milk, butter, and cheese, has developed 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 147 

large industries. While the Chinese and Japanese are two 
great peoples who have not utilized milk or any of its prod- 
ucts as food for grown people to any extent, yet we are fully 
justified in counting these foods among the necessities. 
Nothing can fully take the place of milk in the family dietary. 
Figure 41 shows how all the foodstuffs are represented in 
milk. When milk first comes from the cow the fat is sus- 
pended in tiny, invisible particles throughout the water, 
giving the milk its yellow tint, and the fat rises to the top 
in the form of cream after a few hours. The protein, sugar, 
and ash are dissolved in the water. When milk reaches the 
stomach, the protein separates from the water in the form of 
curd. This change is brought about by an enzyme (soluble 
ferment) called rennin, which is present, along with pepsin, 
in the gastric juice. Curd is also formed by the souring of 
milk through the action of bacteria, or by adding acid di- 
rectly to the milk. Milk should never be gulped down, but 
taken in sips, so that only small portions of curd are formed 
in the stomach, because these are much easier to digest than 
large ones. Sometimes milk is soured purposely, as in butter- 
milk or zoolak or matzoon, that curds may form and be 
beaten fine before it is drunk. This is very easy to digest, 
because then no large curds can form. For the same reason, 
it is often better to take milk with bread or some other food, 
or to cook it in some dish. Skim milk is a valuable food, for 
it has everything found in whole milk but the fat. We miss 
the flavor of the fat in drinking it, hence it is better to use it 
in pudding or soup or in cooking cereals where we do riot care 
so much about the milk flavor. Study Fig. 41, comparing 
the percentages of the foodstuffs in whole, skim, and butter- 
milk, and cream. Notice that the skim milk is higher than 
the whole milk in protein and sugar, that it has as much ash, 
and a trace of fat even. It does not tell us, however, that

foods compare in fuel value is shown in Fig. 42. 

Wholesome and clean milk. At present, the milk supply 
is one of our most pressing community problems, showing

how closely the country and the city are united. A case of 
typhoid fever in one farm family, not properly cared for, may 
be the seed of a serious epidemic in some town. To insure 
clean milk to the consumer, and a fair return in money to the 
producer, is a great sanitary and commercial problem, not 
to be solved in a day. 

Milk is a medium in which bacteria flourish, both the harm- 
less and the disease producing. Typhoid fever and other 
fatal diseases may be carried by milk from unclean barns 



150 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and dairies, and tuberculosis is possible from diseased cows. 
The cows must be in good health, and the stable clean. 
Figure 43 shows a stable with cement floor and good drainage. 
The cows must themselves be clean, and should be curried

and washed. The milkers should have clean clothes and 
hands, and all receptacles should be sterilized. The milk 
must be rapidly cooled (see Fig. 44), bottled in sterilized 
bottles, kept cool during transportation, and delivered as 
promptly as possible to the consumer. " Certified " milk 
is produced and handled under the best conditions, but costs 
at least 15 cents a quart. Since a quart of milk is equiv- 
alent to a pound of steak or to 8 eggs, milk even at 15 to 
20 cents a quart is more economical than meat and eggs at 
ordinary prices. At the usual price of 8 to 10 cents a 
quart, milk is very economical as compared with other per- 
ishable foods. 

The question of preservation and pasteurization can be 
treated here but briefly. Preservatives are forbidden by 
law in most states. Pasteurization is heating at a tempera- 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 151 

ture sufficiently high to kill any disease germs present, but 
not high enough to give a cooked taste. This process, while 
it destroys most of the bacteria, does not kill the spores of all. 
The chief arguments against pasteurization are (1) that on a 
commercial scale it is difficult to really accomplish this, and 
(2) that it is easily used to cover the sale of unclean milk. 
The argument for it is, that it is impossible to obtain as yet

FIG. 44. Milk bottling room. 

an ideal supply for a large city in hot weather, and that 
pasteurization, if properly conducted, kills nearly all of the 
dangerous bacteria and saves the lives of many babies. 
Clean milk that needs no pasteurization is our ultimate 
aim, and we must remember that milk pasteurized under 
unknown conditions needs to be kept cold and treated with 
even more care than fresh milk, for it " spoils" quite as easily, 
only we may not know it because it may not taste sour. 
In the last few years the question of pasteurization has 



152 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

been studied with very great care. It is found best to heat 
the milk for 20 to 30 minutes at a temperature of 140 to 
155 F. If it is certain that this method has been used, one 
need not hesitate to trust the milk, for the arguments against 
pasteurization do not properly apply here. 

How to buy. Investigate by question and inspection, if 
possible, the available milk supply. Be sure to do this in the 
country in the summer. Always buy bottled milk. Where 
the income is small, good quality milk should be used for the 
little children and invalids, and skim milk purchased for 
cooking. In many places skim milk is supplied in bottles 
by reliable firms. The usual price for bottled milk in the 
city is 8 to 10 cents, and this is of good average quality. 
Keep milk cold. If there is no ice, use an ice substitute 
(page 74), and in very hot weather pasteurize or scald the 
milk, cooling afterward as quickly as possible by placing in 
cold water and stirring the water. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cookery. Clean, sweet milk is an ideal food, which 
requires no cooking. Heating milk to 212 F. changes its proper- 
ties in some way, so that it is not considered an ideal food for 
babies' regular diet. If it must be used, for reasons of safety, 
some uncooked food, such as orange juice, should also be given. 
This is the reason for pasteurizing milk instead of boiling it. 

Heating milk in an open vessel causes some of the protein to 
harden into a thin " skin " on the top. This can be prevented 
by stirring the milk until it is cool. 

i. To pasteurize milk. This cannot be done accurately without 
a thermometer. The milk bottle should be placed upon a 
rack in a kettle of water, with a clean thermometer inserted 
through the cover of the bottle. Heat the water slowly, 
and watch the thermometer. When it reaches 155 F., see that 
the water becomes no hotter. Set the kettle on a rack on 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 153 

the stove top, or use a simmering burner with, rack and as- 
bestos mat. It is difficult to keep the temperature even, but 
it should remain at 140-155 F. hah 3 an hour. At the end of 
hah 3 an hour, the bottle should be removed, and cooled as 
rapidly as possible in running cold water. 

2. Rennet custard. 1 quart milk, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 

a shake of salt, flavoring, 1 rennet tablet. The flavoring 
may be: 1 teaspoonful vanilla, or a few tablespoonfuls of 
orange juice, or the vanilla, plus three or four tablespoonfuls of 
cocoa to suit the taste. 

To prepare. This is a process without cooking. Rennet 
tablets are made from the stomach of the calf, and contain the 
digestive enzyme, rennin, which results in the solidifying of the 
curd of the milk. Rennet custard has passed the first stage of 
milk digestion. 

Put all the flavoring substances into the milk, and warm it 
slightly, not more than 100 F. The cocoa when used should 
be " dissolved '- in a small amount of hot water. Dissolve 
the rennet in a tablespoonful of cold water, and stir this very 
thoroughly into the milk. Pour the milk into the cups in which 
the custard will be served, and set the cups in a warm but not 
hot place. A good method is to place them in a pan of warm 
water (100 F.). The milk becomes firm in a hah 3 hour or an 
hour, and as soon as it is set, should be put in the ice box, other- 
wise the process continues and the custard becomes watery 
as the curd shrinks and forces out the whey. Serve very cold 
with fruit on the top, or whipped cream with the cocoa flavoring ; 
or put grated nutmeg or powdered cinnamon on the top. 
This is a simple and delicious dessert, and one of the most whole- 
some. For children it should be flavored with fruit juice or 
vanilla rather than with cocoa. 

3. Uses of sour milk. Do not throw away any sour milk that is 

clean and not stale. Milk that has soured enough to set, is a 
delicious dessert, with cream and sugar. The acid is very pleas- 
ant, being the same as that of buttermilk. Sour milk is better for 
griddlecakes and muffins than sweet milk. (See Chapter XI.) 
Another excellent use for sour milk is to make it into cottage 
cheese. (See below.) 



154 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Matzoon and other similar preparations are essentially 
soured milks, prepared under controlled conditions. These 
preparations are the common form of milk in certain parts 
of the Orient, where milk is never used sweet. 

Kumyss is milk slightly soured and fermented with one 
species of yeast. This is a Russian method. These prep- 
arations are excellent for invalids and exhausted people, 
for they can sometimes be assimilated because of the fine 
curds when sweet milk cannot. 

Condensed milk is a practical method of preserving milk. 
The milk is evaporated under pressure at a high temperature 
in apparatus constructed for the purpose. Cane sugar or 
glucose is sometimes added. A new patent process con- 
denses the milk at low temperature, preserving it for a short 
period, as compared with the condensed milk in tins, but it 
keeps well for several days, and bears transportation. Con- 
densed milk may be used in cooking, when clean fresh milk 
is not available. The unsweetened kinds are most useful, 
but, like pasteurized milk, must be treated with care after 
the cans are opened. 

Cheese. Cheese is made from the curd of milk, and con- 
tains the most nutritive parts of the milk in highly con- 
centrated form. In the process of manufacture, the milk 
is first curdled by rennet, and the whey strained out. The 
curds after preliminary treatment, varying according to the 
style of cheese to be made, are finally pressed together very 
slowly in a cheese press, which is screwed down more tightly 
as the cheese becomes dryer. The cheeses are then covered 
with cheesecloth and " ripened " slowly, the ripening process 
giving characteristic consistency and flavor. This ripening 
is due to the action of bacteria and molds. (See page 97.) 
Foreign varieties of cheese, made originally in some one lo- 
cality, have marked colors, quality, and flavors, as Brie, 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 



155 



Camembert, Roquefort, and 
the Swiss cheeses. . Parmesan 
is an Italian cheese, excellent 
with macaroni and spaghetti. 
American cheeses vary in 
color, in strength of flavor, 
in creaminess, and in degree 
of hardness. Much the 
greater part is, however, of 
the general type known as 
"American cheddar" or 
"standard factory" cheese. 

Club cheese is an American 
cheese of good quality, put 
up in small jars. It is a soft 
cheese, excellent to serve with 
crackers, but is too expensive 
for common use. 

Cottage cheese is a home 
product made from sour milk, 
and used at once. 

Composition and nutritive 
value. Cheese is high in 
protein, and usually in fat. 
(See Fig. 40.) Note the small 
amount of water, which 
makes cheese a very concen- 
trated food. The protein 
content makes it a meat sub- 
stitute, for those with whom 
cheese does not disagree. 
Being a dense as welt as con- 
centrated form of food, it 




156 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

should be eaten in small quantities, and in combination with 
other food materials in such a way that it will become finely 
divided, or it will not be easily digested. The ash content 
is high, the most valuable of the ash constituents of the milk 
being retained in the cheese. 

The cost of cheese. The foreign cheeses are expensive, 
but American cheeses may be classed among the moderate 
priced foods and they compare favorably with other protein 
foods. 

Cheese costs more than beans, and less than most cuts 
of meat. A good American cheese costs about twenty-five 
cents per pound. Taking account of composition as well as 
cost per pound, we find that a given amount of money buys 
about twice as much food value when spent for cheese as it 
would if spent for beef. See Fig. 45. 

Care of cheese in the pantry. Cheese should be kept dry 
and covered, that its odor may not be noticeable. Soft 
cheese should be kept in the ice box. The receptacle for 
cheese should be thoroughly sterilized before each new pur- 
chase is put away. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

1. Uncooked cheese. Serve a cream cheese with a salad of let- 

tuce, and the imported cheeses with crackers and fruit for 
dessert. American cheese may be thinly sliced and used in 
sandwiches. A small piece of cheese with apple pie or pudding 
is an old-fashioned combination that is always agreeable, but 
sometimes difficult of digestion. 

2. Cottage cheese. Use sour milk that has set. Other ingre- 

dients: salt to taste, cayenne pepper or paprika, if liked. 
Quality and flavor are improved by the addition of a table- 
spoonful of butter or two tablespoonfuls of cream to a pint of 
the curd, but these are not necessary. 

Warm the milk slowly, until the whey begins to separate 
from the curd. If this process is continued too long, and the 



EGGS, MILK, AND CHEESE 157 

milk becomes hot, the curd will be tough. Place a piece of 
cheesecloth over a bowl, pour in the curds and whey, and lift 
the cloth carefully, allowing the whey to run through. Squeeze 
out the remaining whey. Add the seasoning and other ingre- 
dients to the curd, shape in balls, and chill before serving. It 
is delicious served with lettuce and dressing as a salad, or with 
gingerbread for dessert at luncheon or supper. 
Principles of cooking cheese. The fat in the cheese is melted by 
heat. The protein is toughened by a high temperature, there- 
fore a low temperature process should be used. 

3. Cheese cooked with other food materials. A creamy cheese 

should be selected for cooking. Cheese may be grated and 
sprinkled on the top of potato on the half shell, or any 
other mashed potato ; or it may be sliced and placed with each 
layer in escalloped potato. Its use is common with macaroni ; 
and a dish of macaroni with milk and cheese is a good meat 
substitute, and may be used as the main dish of a luncheon or 
simple dinner. Those to whom cheese is agreeable will find 
many places for -its use. Its flavor harmonizes with celery and 
with tomato. The Italians serve grated Parmesan cheese with 
soup, and with spaghetti that has a tomato sauce. 

4. Cheese crackers. Select crackers of a firm quality that will 

not crumble or flake easily, and of a small size. Spread very 
thinly with soft butter, put the crackers in a pan, and 
sprinkle grated cheese upon each one. Set the pan in a mod- 
erate oven until the cheese is melted. A sprinkling of paprika 
may be used. Serve with lettuce, celery, or other green salad.

CHAPTER X 
THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 

FATS are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but 
have much more carbon than the other kinds of foodstuffs. 
Notice in Fig. 46 that olive oil and lard are pure fats 
the other fat foods containing water, protein, and ash. Fat 
is available in various forms, with differing flavors and a 
wide range of prices. To many people it is unpalatable in 
some of its cheapest forms ; yet its use is important, and some 
kind should be included in the diet. Fluid and emulsified 
fats are the most easily digested, hence olive oil, cream, and 
egg yolk are highly desirable. Bacon and butter belong 
nearly in the same class. A vigorous man at hard labor can 
digest fat of any kind without difficulty, and needs it because 
it gives so much fuel in proportion to its bulk. 

Fat tends to retard gastric digestion, and delicate persons 
must be careful about taking with it other foods which are 
hard to digest, or taking it in the form of fried foods, pastries, 
rich cakes, and sauces. Persons with delicate appetite, 
who lose weight because they do not get enough fuel, may be 
benefited by taking a little more fat in the diet, especially 
if they do not digest starch and sugar readily, but a very 
large amount (over 6 or 7 ounces a day) will not be perfectly 
digested. 

Fat as a food. Beef fat, as it occurs with lean, is a digestible fat. 
If thoroughly browned in the cooking process, it is most pala- 
table, and the taste for it should be cultivated. In gravy, it may 
be used with potato, instead of butter. Fat tried out from suet, may

be used in place of butter as an ingredient in some puddings, and 
even in batter mixtures. It may also be used with vegetables when 
the price of butter is prohibitive. See Fig. 47. 

Bacon is a digestible and agreeable form of fat, but it is not so 
cheap as beef fat, though cheaper than butter. 

Fat pork is lower in price than bacon, and can be assimilated by 
vigorous people, especially those living out of doors. 

Cream is one of the most delicious fatty food materials, and is 
digestible, but ranks with butter and bacon as to cost. While it 
is not a cheap food, it is not such an extravagance when moderately 
used as some people suppose, who have not worked out the problem. 
Usually the most economical source of cream is to take it from 
the top of the bottle of milk. The remaining partially skimmed 
milk may be used at table or in cooking or for making cottage 
cheese. 

Butter is a digestible fat, ranking at present among the more 
expensive food materials. 

Watchfulness is necessary with both cream and milk that clean- 
liness and quality may be insured. 

Butter substitutes. These are made from beef fat and other 
edible fats and oils, and are much less expensive than butter. They 
may be used in cooking with good result. The usual trade names 
are butterine, or oleomargarine, or some word similar to these. 
Oleomargarine has the same food value as butter at lower cost, but 
lacks fine flavor. 

Olive or sweet oil. The fat content of olive oil is one hundred 
per cent, its fuel value being equal to that of lard. See Fig. 46. 
It is made in Italy, France, Spain, and California, the oils from 
the different countries differing somewhat in flavor. The cheaper 
grades are sometimes adulterated with corn oil or cottonseed oil, 
which have the same food value but should, of course, be sold under 
their own names and not at olive oil prices. An American firm is 
now manufacturing olive oil in Spain ; this and the California 
olive oil are of high grade. Italian oil by the gallon is of good 
quality, and usually somewhat less expensive than the French. 
It is a costly food material, but valuable in the dietary. Never 
buy it in small bottles, as this adds greatly to the cost. The most 
economical method is to purchase by the gallon in a tin can. If 
kept cool, it will not deteriorate except very slowly. Always wipe 
off the mouth of the bottle or can before pouring out the oil. 



162 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Fat as a cooking medium. Fat is necessary for the; saute*, 
and for deep fat frying. For deep fat frying several prep- 
arations are made from cottonseed oil that are agreeable 
to use and of moderate price. 

Lard has been the most commonly used, but many people object 
to the flavor. Beef drippings should be saved and kept cool in 
covered jelly glasses. These drippings are useful for browning 
vegetables, meatballs, and in pan-broiling if a small amount of 
additional fat is necessary. 

When deep fat frying is used, great pains must be taken to 
see that the fat is sufficiently hot in order that the food ma- 
terial may not soak fat, and the cooked food must be kept 
hot when the fat is draining off on absorptive paper. The 
best fats for this purpose are the vegetable oils. The re- 
fined cottonseed oils now on the market are excellent. For 
details of use see page 120. Keep a box of sand to pour into 
it, if the kettle of fat takes fire. Never pour water into 
blazing fat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

Fat melts at a low temperature. 

At about 350 F. it begins to smoke. 

At a higher temperature, a chemical change takes place, and the 
fat finally " burns," as the hydrogen and oxygen pass off. 

It is emulsified by mixing with a substance like egg. 

1. To whip cream. Chill the cream, and set it in a bowl of ice 

water, or chipped ice. If the cream is warm, the beating will 
churn the cream to butter. 

(1) For a fine, close-whipped cream use a Dover egg beater. 

(2) For a lighter whipped cream, use a wire beater. 

2. To mold butter. A pair of wooden butter pats is necessary 

for this. Dip these first into hot water, then into cold. Cut 
off a square piece of butter, enough for one person, make it 
flat or round with two knives, and then roll it into shape 
between the butter pats. Chill, and serve in a dish on ice; 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 163 

or give one to each person on a butter plate, just at the last 
moment before serving the meal. Never serve soft butter. 

3. To cook bacon. Bacon has alternate layers of fat and lean, 

but it is the fat that has chief consideration in the cook- 
ing process. The aim is to brown and crisp the fat without 
burning it and without causing a volume of smoke in the 
kitchen. Make ready a frying pan, and have at hand a jar 
for holding fat standing on a plate. Cut the bacon in thin 
slices with a sharp knife. Heat the pan, and put in the bacon. 
The fat will begin to " try out " at the melting point. Pour 
this melted fat into the jar. Turn the pieces of bacon with a fork. 
If the smoke is rising in volumes the pan is too hot. The 
novice should not try this experiment for the first time by her- 
self. The fat may even burst into flame if the pan is too hot. 
When the bacon is sufficiently cooked to become crisp on cool- 
ing, it is ready to serve, by itself, with toast, or with eggs. 

The making of sauces and gravies. Many sauces and 
gravies are made from a fat, mixed with a starchy substance, 
the two mingled with a liquid. The fat gives flavor and 
nutriment, the starch is used for thickening, the liquid also 
gives flavor. You are now familiar with the cooking of fat 
and starch, and can readily understand that the combination 
of all these ingredients is not an easy matter. The fat will 
float upon the top of the liquid unless the right amount of 
starch or flour is used, and the flour will have a tendency to 
lump. There are several good methods in use. The method 
given for your experiment is one of the simplest, because it 
uses only a few utensils, and gives uniformly good results. 
It requires no more watchfulness than the other methods. 

These sauces and gravies are not foods for little children 
and invalids. 

4. Foundation recipe for sauces. 

Proportions. 

(1) Thin sauce (for milk toast) 

1 tablespoonful of fat, 1 of flour, pint liquid. 



164 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

or (2) Medium sauce (for vegetables) . 

2 tablespoonfuls of fat, 2 of flour, f pint liquid. 

or (3) Thicker sauce, also for vegetables, meats, fish, and 
macaroni. 

3 tablespoonfuls of fat 3 of flour, % pint liquid. 
Salt is used to taste. 

Method. Melt the fat in a saucepan. Pour in the flour, 
all at once, and stir the flour and fat together, until the mass 
thickens slightly. Pour in all the liquid at once, cold. Set 
the saucepan where the heat is moderate. 

Stir steadily with a wooden spoon until the mixture thickens. 

5. A white sauce is made with butter, and milk the liquid. Stop 

the cooking just short of the boiling point. 

6. A tomato sauce is made with butter or beef fat, strained tomato 

juice the liquid. Cook a piece of onion, a sprig of parsley, 
or a small portion of dried herbs, and a clove with the tomato 
before straining, if these flavors are liked. 

7. A brown sauce or meat gravy may be made in the same way, using 

beef fat, and (as the liquid) water that has been poured into 
the pan in which the meat is cooked. When you are familiar 
with cooking there is an easier way for thickened meat gravies, 
as follows : 

Pour off some of the fat from the meat pan. Set the pan 
upon the stove and stir in the flour, about two tablespoonfuls 
for the ordinary roasting pan. When the flour is thoroughly 
mixed in, add about a pint of water, cold or warm, and stir 
again. Pour this mixture through a strainer. With practice 
you can make an excellent gravy in this way. It requires 
judgment to proportion the flour and liquid to the material 
in the pan. 

THE SUGARS 

Sugars are of common occurrence in the vegetable world 
in the fruits and juices of many plants. Pure grape juice 
may contain as high as 25 per cent of glucose though usually 
it is not so concentrated. Glucose is also found in consider- 
able amount in sweet corn and onions. It is not so sweet as

166 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cane sugar (sucrose). Fructose is one of the sweetest of 
sugars, and helps to give honey its great sweetness. 

Lactose or milk sugar is found chiefly in milk. It is the 
least sweet of all the sugars. If there were as much cane 
sugar in milk, we should soon grow tired of it because it would 
be too sweet. It is sometimes added to milk to make its 
fuel value higher, especially in case the milk has been diluted, 
as in the diet of babies and invalids. 

Maltose or malt sugar is formed from starch in germinating 
seeds. 

Sucrose or cane sugar is most commonly manufactured 
from sugar cane and sugar beets. To a much smaller extent 
it is made commercially from the sugar maple, sorghum cane, 
and sugar palm, and it is found in considerable amount in 
some common fruits and vegetables. 

Its manufacture forms a great industry, and its consumption 
is enormous, some ten million tons coming into commerce 
annually, and this does not represent the total consumption. 

Figure 48 shows the composition of several common sugars. 
Notice that the granulated sugar is a pure foodstuff, being 
100 per cent carbohydrate, while all the others contain traces 
of protein, ash, and water. Sugar is a fuel food, exclusively, 
like olive oil and other pure fats. 

Sugar is a valuable food material, but should not be used 
in excess ; the tendency in the United States is rather toward 
an excessive use of sugar. It is liable to cause an acid fer- 
mentation in digestion, when taken in large amounts, and is 
sure to irritate the stomach. It should be well diluted by 
other foods. The amount that may be eaten daily varies 
for most people from two ounces for young children to four 
ounces for adults, but many people cannot eat these amounts 
without more or less irritation of the stomach. It is a com- 
mon practice to oversweeten cakes and desserts, the sweet- 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 167 

ness of the sugar often disguising other agreeable flavors. 
The liking for sweets should be well under control, for the 
eating of too much sugar is a habit easy to form, and one 
which crowds out other valuable foods. 

Cane Sugar is sold both brown and white, and is manu- 
factured in powdered, granulated, and solid form, the latter 
usually cut in cubes or dominoes. 

The canes are first crushed, the juices passing from the 
machine being of a rather dark greenish color. This juice 
is first clarified and filtered, and then boiled down in order to 
crystallize the sugar, the liquid sirup forming molasses. 
In the older methods the sirup was boiled in open pans, and 
the crystals filtered from the molasses by a slow process. 
In the modern process the sirup is boiled at a low temperature 
in vacuum pans, and the sugar is separated from the molasses 
by a centrifugal machine, built on the same principle as a 
cream separator. The principles of beet sugar manufacture 
are essentially the same, with some differences in detail. 

The molasses manufactured in the older method is richer 
in cane sugar and is a better table molasses than the new 
process molasses, the latter being used chiefly for the manu- 
facture of alcohol. Molasses is either dark or light, the 
darker having a stronger flavor especially suited to ginger- 
bread and Indian meal pudding. Molasses comes in the 
bulk, and may be slightly acid ; or in cans, in which case no 
acid fermentation should have taken place. Where canned 
molasses is used in a batter, it is sometimes necessary to 
use baking powder instead of soda. " New Orleans " is a 
light-colored molasses, " Porto Rico " dark. 

Brown sugar has not passed through the refining processes 
necessary to the whitening of the sugar. It is softer than the 
granulated white, has a decided brownish color and a rich 
flavor. 



168 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

In buying sugar it is economy to purchase granulated in 
large quantities, a fraction of a cent per pound being saved 
in this way. The cut sugar comes in convenient boxes, 
which keep the product clean. Powdered sugar may be 
bought in small quantities, three or five pounds, since it is 
not used so much in cooking as the granulated. 

Candy, homemade and purchased. Candy, if not eaten 
between meals, is an allowable form of sugar. The best 
time for eating it is at the end of a meal, one or two pieces. 
Even in this case, however, it would be better for the body if 
the craving for sweet were satisfied by fruit rather than candy. 

Candy made at home costs less than high grade commer- 
cial candy, even counting in the labor. It is superior to cheap 
grade candy, which may even contain poisonous coloring 
matter. It is a pleasure to make it at times, and it is always 
a pleasing gift at the holiday season. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

Principles of cooking. 

A sirup is formed by cooking sugar with water. 
The sirup thickens if process is prolonged and water evaporates. 
Cane sugar is changed to glucose and fructose by boiling with 
an acid. 

Heated without additional water, the sugar is partially decom- 
posed, giving off water and becoming brown in color. This is 
" caramel," used for coloring, and flavoring. 

The final stage of heating leaves pure carbon. 
8. Peanut brittle. 
Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Peanuts 1 quart 

Method. Shell the peanuts and chop them in small pieces. 
Put the sugar in a saucepan and place over a moderate fire. 
Stir from the bottom until the sugar is entirely melted and of a 



THE FATS AND THE SUGARS 169 

rich brown color. The sugar will lump badly at first, but these 
lumpc will entirely melt in time. Turn the chopped peanuts 
and salt into the sirup and stir together and immediately 
turn out on a buttered pan. When cold, break into pieces. 

9. Fudge. 

Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar f teaspoonful 

Chocolate 2 squares 

Milk or water 1 cup 

Vanilla 1 teaspoonful 

Method. Mix the first four ingredients and place over a 
hot fire. Stir steadily until the mixture begins to boil. Stir 
occasionally after this until, when half a teaspoonful is dropped 
into cold water, it may be rolled to a Softball with the fingers. 
Set the saucepan in a cool place and leave until it becomes 
just lukewarm. Add the vanilla and stir the mixture until it 
becomes thick and seems very slightly granular. Pour it into 
a buttered tin and as soon as possible cut into squares. The 
exact point at which to remove the fudge from the fire and 
again at which to cease stirring and pour into the pan is a 
matter which only practice can teach. 

10. Penocha. 

Ingredients. 

Brown sugar 2 cups 

Butter 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk, cream, or water 1 cup 

Cream of tartar | teaspoon or less 

Vanilla 1 teaspoon 

Method. As with recipe 9. The very dark brown sugar 
contains some acid and therefore less cream of tartar may 
be used. Chopped nuts may be added with the vanilla to 
both fudge and penocha. 
IT. Fondant for French creams. 
Ingredients. 

Sugar 2 cups 

Cream of tartar | teaspoonful 

Boiling water f cup 



170 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Method. Mix the sugar and cream of tartar. Add the 
boiling water and place over a moderate fire, stirring slowly 
and steadily until the sugar is dissolved. Do not stir after 
the mixture begins to boil, but let it boil slowly until the 
sirup will form a soft ball in cold water. Turn out on a platter 
without scraping the saucepan. The success of the fondant 
depends upon the complete changing of the cane sugar into 
fructose and glucose, the crystals of the latter being much finer 
than those of cane sugar. Stirring the mixture while it boils or 
before it has cooled sufficiently will result in the formation of 
cane sugar crystals, and the fondant will be harsh and rough. 

When the fondant is barely lukewarm begin to stir it with 
long steady strokes and continue this until the mixture becomes 
creamy and thick and begins to break away from the sides of 
the dish and the spoon. Then gather it all together into a 
round mass and knead like bread until it becomes pliable. It 
may then be wrapped in oiled paper or put into a covered 
bowl or fruit jar and kept until wanted. 

Fondant is the foundation for all bon bons and may be made 
up into a great variety of shapes and with many flavors. It 
may be mixed with chopped candied fruits or nuts or coated 
with chocolate.

CHAPTER XI 
MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 

WHEAT flour is the important material in this group, but 
muffins and biscuit may be varied by the use of corn meal, 
rye, and Graham flour, and cooked cereals may also be uti- 
lized. The ingredients are flour, salt, a liquid, sometimes a 
fat, eggs, and sugar. The flavorings are spices, essences, 
fruit juice, dried fruits, nuts, chocolate. The mixture must 
be smooth, but it is also necessary to make it porous or 
" light." This is accomplished by means of leavening agents, 
" to leaven " meaning " to make light." 

Leavening agents. The batter, or dough, is leavened by 
introducing into it air or a gas that expands when heated in 
the oven, thus making the whole more porous and larger in 
bulk. 

Air. This is introduced into the batter by beating, or by beat- 
ing air into the w,hite of egg and stirring the beaten white into the 
batter. 

Steam. The water in the batter turns to steam in the oven, 
and as it expands it assists in the leavening of the mass. See 
Popovers. 

Carbon dioxide gas. This is introduced in three ways. 

(1) By using an acid with a carbonate. 

(2) By yeast fermentation. * \* 

(3) By machinery. 

Yeast fermentation is studied in the chapter on bread making 
(Chapter XII), and the mechanical method is a commercial process 
exclusively. Only the first method will be treated in this 
chapter. 

When an acid and any alkaline carbonate are dissolved together, 

171 



172 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a chemical action takes place, a gas is given off (carbon dioxide) 
and another substance is formed that is neutral, being neither acid 
nor alkaline, and known as a " salt." In selecting the two sub- 
stances we must bear in mind this neutral substance that remains 
in the batter and insure its harmlessness. 

The lactic acid of sour milk is probably the earliest used, being a 
domestic product. The lactic acid is neutralized by bicarbonate 
of sodium, the latter being also called " baking soda." The resulting 
salt is harmless. 

Acid molasses with soda is another old-fashioned method. Here 
the acid is developed by the fermentation of the molasses. 

Cream of tartar (acid potassium tartrate), obtained from crystals 
deposited in wine vats, came into use later, neutralized by bicar- 
bonate of soda, two parts of cream of tartar to one of soda. 

Baking powder. The first baking powders were made of cream 
of tartar and bicarbonate of soda, mixed with a starch, to prevent 
the slight chemical action which would cause the powder to lose 
strength ; and these two substances are now used in the best baking 
powders. The resulting salt is the Rochelle salt of medicine. 

An acid phosphate is sometimes used with soda, and this gives 
a harmless neutral substance. . 

Cheaper acids have sometimes been used, especially alum. It 
is best not to use an alum powder. Select a standard kind, avoid- 
ing those that offer prizes for a certain number of boxes purchased. 
Even if these latter do not contain alum, there is probably an excess 
of starch or flour. 

The advantage of baking powder is in the accuracy of the propor- 
tions of the two substances by weight. Even though the measur- 
ing of the cream of tartar and soda separately is accurate, the 
proportions may not be correct. There is no great advantage in 
homemade baking powder. It costs almost as much as the manu- 
factured, and is not as perfect a product. 

The proportions of the main ingredients. Attempts are 
made to define the degrees of stiffness of batters and doughs, 
but these distinctions are not very accurate. A " pour bat- 
ter " is liquid enough to pour, and a " dough batter" soft 
enough to drop from a spoon; a "soft dough" is next in 
grade, and " dough " is the stiff est of all. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 173 

To understand proportioning the ingredients, the nature 
of the ingredients when heated must be taken into account. 
Butter and other fats melt when heated, and behave like a 
liquid in the mixture. Therefore, when there is a very large 
amount of butter, no other wetting is necessary, as in pound 
cake. We may make a scale, with a thin popover mixture 
at one extreme, with no butter in it, and the stiff pound cake 
at the other, with butter the only liquid (except the flavor- 
ing). Between these two are the mixtures of medium stiff- 
ness, with both butter and liquid. This general rule may 
be given : As the quantity of butter is increased, the batter 
must increase in stiffness, and there must be either less liquid 
or more flour. 

A beaten egg looks like a liquid and behaves so during the 
mixing, but in the oven it stiffens. For this reason we can 
make a sponge cake with many eggs and no liquid in the 
mixing, and use no other leavening agent than the air beaten 
into the eggi 

One old-fashioned rule for sponge cake reads : Take the 
weight of the eggs in sugar and half their weight in flour, 
with the juice and rind of a lemon for ten eggs. Such a rule 
was adapted to the days when eggs were cheap. We should 
now use fewer eggs in sponge cake, and this means that water 
and baking powder must replace the eggs omitted. 

Methods of mixing. (1) For popovers, griddlecakes, muffins, and 
plain cake. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 

Beat the eggs, without separating the yolk and white, and stir 
the eggs and milk together. 

Pour the liquid gradually into the flour, first stirring, then 
beating. 

Melt the butter or other shortening, and beat it into the batter. 

(2) Biscuits and shortcakes. 

Sift together the dry ingredients. 



174 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cut in or chop in the butter. 
Add the wetting slowly. 

(3) A richer, fine-grained butter cake. 
Sift together the dry ingredients. 
Cream the butter, and beat in the sugar. 

Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 

Beat the yolks into the creamed butter and sugar. 

Add the flour and milk alternately ; that is, a quarter or third 
of the flour, then a portion of the milk, and so on. First stir, then 
beat vigorously. 

Fold in the beaten whites lightly and do not beat the mixture 
again. 

(4) Sponge cake. 

If baking powder is used, sift with the flour. 
Beat the whites and yolks of the eggs separately. 
Beat the sugar into the yolks, and add the liquid and flavoring. 
Add the flour and beaten whites in alternate portions, dividing 
both into quarters or thirds. 

Baking. This is a science and an arl that requires much 
practice. Do not be discouraged if you do not succeed at 
first. 

Concerning the utensils for baking, see Chapter II. The 
cups or pans are prepared by warming and greasing. Use a 
bit of soft paper or a brush for greasing the pan and 
ordinarily an inexpensive fat, reserving butter for delicate 
cake. Flour sprinkled on a pan is sufficient for biscuit and 
cookies. Line a pan for loaf cake with white paper, and 
grease the paper. 

See that the oven is ready before the mixing begins. We 
shall not be able to bake accurately until our ovens are 
equipped with thermometers. In the meantime we must 
use some simple oven test. The indicators on the doors of 
some ovens are a guide, although they are not really accurate 
according to the scale of the thermometer. A glass door is 
also a convenience. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 175 

A loaf should be baked at a lower temperature than a 
biscuit or muffin. Why? 

For loaves, 380 F. Test by the hand, counting fifteen 
slowly, fifteen seconds. A piece of white paper will become 
a delicate brown in five minutes. 

For biscuits, muffins, and small cakes, 425 to 450 F. 
Test by the hand, a count of ten. A piece of paper becomes 
a deeper golden brown in five minutes. 

Any mixture containing baking powder may stand some 
little time before it is put in the oven, provided it is kept 
cold. The action of the baking powder is not immediate, 
and is very slight at a low temperature. 

The stages of the baking are first, the rising ; second, the 
crusting over ; third, the baking of the interior ; and last, a 
shrinkage of the whole. 

Many ovens bake unevenly, and pans must be shifted. 
This should be done with care and not before the third stage 
of the baking. It is often well to cool off the oven the latter 
part of the time. An oven that is too hot may be cooled by 
a pan of water. Paper may be laid over the top of the cake 
if the browning has been too rapid. These are all make- 
shifts, and indicate a poor oven, or poor management of the 
fire. Do not look into the oven for the first ten minutes of 
baking, and always close the oven door gently. 

When we are privileged to have electric ovens, with glass 
doors, and an accurate thermometer, baking will be an easy 
and accurate process. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

A. Experiments with baking powder. 

1. Dissolve half a teaspoonful of baking powder in two table- 
spoonfuls of water and heat in a test tube, or saucepan, over a 
flame ; notice the effervescence when the bubbling is at its height, 



176 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and hold a lighted match in the mouth of the tube. This is a simple 
test for carbon dioxide. 

2. Dissolve 2 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar in | cup water in 
a glass. 

Dissolve 1 teaspoonful of bicarbonate of soda in cup water in 
a glass. 

Taste both of these. 

Test both with litmus paper, noting the change of color. There 
are several vegetable coloring matters that change color in this 
way, in the presence of an acid or an alkaline substance. 

Turn the two solutions together, and test with both blue and 
pink litmus paper, after the solution has stood for several minutes. 
What results ? 

Taste this mixed solution to see if you can detect any difference. 

To prove that there is a substance still left, evaporate the water. 

3. A pretty form of this experiment is to use, instead of litmus 
the water in which red cabbage has previously been boiled and 
which therefore contains some of the coloring matter of the cabbage. 
The changes in color are very striking, and prove conclusively that 
neither the cream of tartar nor the soda remains such. 

B. Oven experiments. 

If one oven in the school kitchen can be equipped with a chemi- 
cal thermometer inserted in the oven, the following experiments

1. Let each pupil test the oven by feeling, when it has reached 
380 F., 400 F., 425 F., 450 F., 475 F.-500 F.

Milk 1 pint 

Eggs 3 

Salt | teaspoonful 

Some rules give two eggs only. 

For baking, heavy earthen cups, hot and greased. 
Method of mixing is No. 1. 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 177 

Special points.\ The liquid must be poured very slowly into 
the flour to prevent lumping. A large Dover egg beater is 
convenient for beating out lumps, if any occur. 

The leavening of the popover is effected by steam, and it 
is not necessary therefore to spend time and strength in the 
long beating sometimes recommended. This has been con- 
clusively proved by experiment. Neither is it necessary to 
put the batter into the oven immediately, as sometimes di- 
rected. It may stand all day or even over night. 

Pour the batter in the hot cups, having each cup two thirds 
full. The baking of the popovers is unique, in that they should 
be put into an intensely hot oven for the first stage of the baking 
as hot as 475 F., or even more then the oven must be 
cooled. This first stage crusts the top ; then the expansive 
force of the steam pushes up the top ; and the muffin " pops " or 
" puffs " over. The more moderate heat cooks the sides and 
the bottom, and makes an agreeable crust. The perfect puff- 
over is hollow. Three quarters of an hour is the average time 
of baking. If at the end of that time the oven door is set ajar, 
and the popovers allowed to remain longer, they are improved, 
coming from the oven stiff and crisp with a rich brown color, 
rather than soft and underdone. In an old family cookbook, 
one recipe, sixty years old, calls popovers " Mahogany Cakes." 
They may be eaten as a muffin, or served with a pudding 
sauce as a dessert. 
2. Plain muffins. 

Ingredients for 12. 

Flour 1 pint 

Baking powder 3 teaspoonfuls 

Salt teaspoonful 

Eggs 2 or 1 

Milk \\ cup 

Butter, or butter substitute 1 tablespoonful 
Sugar, if desired 1 tablespoonful 

For baking, greased muffin pan. Bake about hah 3 an hour. 
Method of mixing is No. 1. 
This recipe may be varied in many ways. 

(a) Use \ cup cooked cereal in place o/ an equal quantity 
of flour. Will you change the amount of wetting? 

N 



178 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

(6) One cup fine white corn meal, or \ cup yellow meal in 
place of equal quantities of flour. Corn meal ab- 
sorbs more water than white flour. 

What change in the wetting ? 

The oven should be the temperature for bread, and the 
baking at least f of an hour. 

(c) One cup Graham or rye meal in place of an equal 
quantity of flour. 

3. Baking powder biscuit. 

Ingredients. 

Flour 1 pint 

Baking powder 3 teaspoonfuls 

Salt I teaspoonful 

Butter, or butter substitute 1 or 2 tablespoonfuls 

Milk 1 scant cup 

For shaping, molding board, rolling pin, and biscuit cutter. 

For baking, an iron sheet or pan sprinkled with flour. Oven 
about 425 F., a ten-second test, or golden brown paper. 
Bake twenty minutes to half an hour. 

Method of mixing is No. 2. 

To shape. Dust the board with flour, turn out the dough, 
dredge with flour, pat into a firm mass, and then pat or lightly 
roll out to 5 inch thickness. Cut out with a cutter dipped in 
flour. (A small glass or the top of a round tin can may be used. ) 

Variations. Add 1 egg. This makes a delicious biscuit. 
Sprinkle the top with granulated sugar, and spice. Dried 
currants washed, and dredged with flour, may be laid on the top. 

Increase the butter to two or three tablespoonfuls, and de- 
crease the wetting and the mixture becomes shortcake. This 
is the mixture to use for the true strawberry shortcake. Many 
other fruits may be used, both uncooked and cooked. 

4. Sour milk griddlecakes. 

Ingredients. 

Flour 2 cups

the milk. Pour, liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients and 
stir altogether until smooth. Add the melted butter- and cook 
the cakes the same as with sour milk griddlecakes. 

6. Cookies. Cookies may be plain, or rich in butter ; crisp 

and thin, or soft and thick. They may be sweetened with 
sugar, or molasses, and spiced in various ways. It would be 
an interesting exercise to tabulate all the possible forms of 
cookies. 

Ingredients.

The method of mixing is No. 3. Notice that this is a stiff 
dough. The amount of flour depends somewhat upon the ex- 
pertness of the cooky maker. The flour used in rolling out 
must be accounted for, as the expert can manage a softer 
dough than the novice. Mix the baking powder and salt with 
one cup of the flour. 

Shaping the cookies. Figure 49 shows you the apparatus. 
The dough is turned out upon the floured board, gently rolled 
out to a quarter of an inch, cut and placed in a floured pan ; or 
cut off a small piece, roll in the flour, until it forms a ball, set 
the ball in the pan, and pat it down to a round. This may seem 
to take longer, but it is easier, and there is no board to clean 
afterward. 

A plainer cooky is made with \ cup butter, and | cup water 
or milk, with somewhat more flour.

Ginger 1 teaspoonfuls 

Salt teaspoonful 

Butter 4 tablespoonfuls 

Method. Melt butter in boiling water. Mix dry ingredients. 
Add the molasses to the water and butter and stir this mix- 
ture into the dry ingredients, beating vigorously. Pour into a 
buttered shallow pan and bake twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven. If the molasses is taken from a freshly opened can, no 
acid will be present and the soda should be omitted and 3 tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder used instead. 

Pastry. Pastry is a stiff dough with a large proportion 
of shortening, and is flaky when baked rather than porous. 
Pastry and pies should not be used as a staple food, but when 
well made and properly masticated, pies may be eaten oc- 
casionally by people in good health. The crust should bo 
flaky, and thoroughly baked. 



Laboratory management. Effective work in batters cannot be accom- 
plished with less than | cup liquid, though a smaller portion is sometimes 
used. It is well to have some group work, so that the pupils may learn to 
beat larger quantities. If there is a school lunch room, large quantities 
may be utilized there.

ii. Foundation recipes for pastry. 

1. Proportions. 

(1) Plain crust. 

This crust is more digestible and more economical than the 
" short " or rich crust and may be used for English deep apple 
pie, or meat or chicken pies. 

Flour 2 cups 

Baking powder 2 teaspoonfuls 

Salt \ teaspoonful 
Fat (butter or lard, or 

half of each) \ cup (measured solid) 

Ice water \ cup 

(2) Short crust. 

Flour 2 cups 

Salt \ teaspoonful 

Fat (equal parts butter 

and lard) f cup 

Ice water \ cup 

(3) Rich flaky crust. 

Same as (2) (more fat is to be added later) 

2. Method of mixing for all. 

Have all the ingredients and utensils icy cold. Mix the dry 
ingredients and cut in the fat with two knives. Stir in the ice 
water until the dough will just hold together. Toss upon a 
floured board and roll to | inch or less in thickness. Roll this 
up. If not ready to be used, this pie crust may be covered 
with moist cheesecloth and put on the ice until wanted. This 
amount of crust will make two medium-sized pies with two 
crusts each. 

3. Method of shaping. 

For plain crust. Cut off of the roll of crust. Roll out 
to about | inch thickness. Have a deep dish ready contain- 
ing either the apple or meat fillings (see recipes below) and 
with the edge of dish buttered. Invert a small cup in the 
center of the dish to hold up the crust if apples are used. 
Lay the rolled-out crust over the top, having rolled it a little 



MUFFINS, BISCUIT, CAKE, AND PASTRY 185 

larger than the dish. Turn under the edges of the crust and 
crimp them down on the dish. Make several small cuts in the 
top of the crust to let the steam escape. Bake in a moderate 
oven until the filling (if apples) is cooked and the crust brown. 

For short crust. Cut off | of the roll of crust and roll out 
very thin, keeping the shape round. Line a buttered pie 
plate with the crust. Fill this with the desired filling, moisten 
the edge of bottom crust with water, and cover with another 
round of crust rolled as before. Crimp down the edges of the 
top crust and make cuts in the top as before. Bake until the 
filling is cooked and the crust is brown. 

For rich crust. Roll the crust to \ inch thickness. Have 
ready cup ice-cold fat. Cut off small bits of this and spread 
it in dabs over the rolled-out crust. Roll this again and then 
proceed as for the " short " crust (2). 

12. Apple pie filling. 

Use juicy, tart apples. Pare, cut in quarters, core, and 
slice apples into pie dish, filling it heaping full. Add \ cup 
water and \ cup sugar. Any flavor desired may be used, lemon 
rind, or spices. A little butter gives an agreeable flavor. 

13. Lemon pie filling. 

Ingredients. 

1 heaping tablespoonful corn- ( 1 egg whole, or 

starch mixed with ( yolks of 2 eggs 

A little cold water Juice and rind of 1 lemon 

Large cup hot water A very little salt 

Piece butter the size of walnut Whites of 2 eggs 

1 cup sugar Powdered sugar, 1 table- 
spoonful 

Method. 

Mix the starch with the cold water, add the boiling water 
and cook until it thickens, and add the butter and sugar. 
Beat the egg (or yolks) and add the other ingredients. Add the 
lemon last. When the pie is done, if two yolks were used, beat 
the whites with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, place on the 
top, and brown in a moderate oven. 



186 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

14. Meat or chicken pie. 

Use left-over, cooked meat. Cut the meat into dice or small 
bits and fill the dish. Sprinkle with salt and moisten with 
gravy, if possible. If not, add 1 cup hot water and dredge 
lightly with flour. Have top crust only. 

How would the time for cooking this pie compare with that 
for deep apple pie ?

CHAPTER XII 
YEAST BREAD 

YEAST bread when well made is a food of which the palate 
never tires, and it is usually recognized as a part of every well- 
planned meal. The quick breads are a convenient substi- 
tute at times, but they are not the staff of life in the same 
sense, and are, on the whole, less widely used. 

The making of a perfect loaf of bread is the goal of all 
those who aspire to excel in cookery ; and the art of bread 
making requires not only a clear understanding of the under- 
lying principles, but patience and persistence in experimen- 
tation and practice until a uniformly perfect product is 
achieved. The fact that in yeast we have a living organism 
with which to deal makes the whole process a delicate one, 
in which every detail is of importance, whether it be a matter 
of ingredients, proportions, methods of mixing, or tempera- 
ture. 

The standard of good bread. There will always be some 
difference of opinion in regard to a desirable quality in bread, 
and individual preference will control the final result, whether 
the crumb of the bread shall be dry and porous or somewhat 
more moist and finer in grain. French bread is of the former 
type, the English preferring a close grain and solid loaf. 
Allowing for these differences, it is still possible to standardize 
bread, and to state in percentages the different points to be 
considered in judging a loaf. 

We must consider the size and symmetry of the loaf, in 
order that the interior of the bread may be baked to the very 

187 



188 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

center, without overbaking or burning the crust, and there- 
fore very large loaves should be avoided. The crust should 
be uniform in color, the shade ranging from a light golden 
to a darker brown, and the quality may be soft or crisp, but 
never tough. The crumb should be light, the cavities evenly 
distributed throughout the loaf and of uniform size. It 
should also be elastic, tender, and yet not pasty, evenly 
baked without streaks and heavy portions near the crust, 
and the color should be creamy rather than a snowy white, 
(Fig. 55.) 

The following score cards will be useful in judging loaves, 
and in the bread contests which are interesting and helpful.

Digestibility and nutritive value. Bread of the standard 
described is readily digestible when at least twelve hours old 
and stands high in nutritive value. Figure 51 compares 
the composition of several varieties. 

Like the cereals, it has considerable protein, and some fat, 
but is highest in starch. The white bread, unless made with 
milk, has very little ash. A slice almost one inch thick 
weighing 1.38 ounces, from a baker's five-cent loaf, will yield 
100 Calories. 

The cost of bread. The table in Chapter XVII states 
the amount of protein and energy obtained for ten cents from 
bread as compared with other common foods, and makes the 
fact clear that bread is essentially one of the cheapest foods, 
remaining relatively so whatever the general fluctuations in 
food prices may be. 

A pound loaf of bread at the bakery should cost five cents, 
the cost being slightly less when the bread is made at home, 
even taking the fuel into account. It is an open question, 
however, whether bread should be made at home or bought 
at the bakery, all the circumstances being weighed in the 
balance by the individual. (See Chapter XVII.) In America, 
we need to learn to dictate and control the methods in the 



YEAST BREAD 191 

public bakeries because bakers' bread is being used more and 
more, although it is said that 50 per cent is still made at 
home. If bread is to be bought, it is necessary for the house- 
keeper to understand the bread-making process and the 
standard of good bread that she may criticize intelligently, 
and force the public bakeries to furnish bread made under 
ideal conditions. Such bread is supplied in France, where 
the housekeepers in the city, though noted for their 
thrift, do not think of bread making at home as a practical 
or economical procedure. It must be understood that the 
baker's oven is fitted to do better work than the small oven 
of the average kitchen, and if the public through laws and in- 
spection will control the quality of the materials used and 
the cleanliness of the process, baker's bread will be a useful 
" ready-cooked " food. 

The ingredients of bread. The essential ingredients are 
flour, water, and yeast. The liquid may be milk, or milk 
and water, the milk changing the flavor slightly and increas- 
ing the nutritive value, while the cream in the milk increases 
the tenderness of the crumb and crust. The non-essentials 
include salt to develop flavor, sugar sometimes added to 
hasten fermentation and also for flavor, and a fat to increase 
tenderness, as, for instance, butter or some cheaper fat. 
Spices and dried fruits are used in sweet breads, and when 
eggs are added sweet bread becomes a plain cake having a 
delicious and characteristic flavor. 

The characteristics of good flour. The average com- 
position of flour is as follows : 

Protein 11.4 per cent 

Fat 1.0 

Carbohydrate 75.1 

Fuel value 1610 Cal. per pound 

100-Calorie portion 28 grams (1 ounce)

The protein occurs in the form of gluten, which has the 
property of stretching and expanding, and which makes the 
framework of the loaf of bread, since it retains the air and 
carbon dioxide, and hardens when baked. The protein of 
oats and corn lacks this property, and therefore oatmeal and 
corn meal give a very different type of bread. Rye flour

FIG. 52. Experiment illustrating the effect of the kind of wheat upon the 
size of the loaf. 

contains gluten, and the rye loaf therefore resembles the 
wheat loaf. Wheat and flour differ largely on account of 
the difference in the amount of gluten, and the gluten itself 
varies in quality with the variety of wheat. 

Figure 52 shows the result of an experiment with flour 
made from different kinds of wheat, all the other factors in 
the bread making being identical. This effect of the differ- 
ence in the composition of the flour is very striking. Again, 
the same variety of wheat will differ from season to season, 



YEAST BREAD 



193 



and the time of planting, also, affects the quality of the 
grain. The time of planting and reaping gives us two classes 
of wheat and flour, the winter and spring. Winter wheat 
is sown in the fall and obtains its first growth before winter, 
living through the winter in those latitudes where the climate 
is sufficiently mild, being harvested in early summer. Spring 
wheat is sown in the spring and harvested late and it is the 
wheat of the great flour-producing state, Minnesota. The 
difference in the composition of the two wheats is shown in 
this table. 1

Note that the spring wheat contains more protein and there- 
fore more gluten. The flour from spring wheat is creamy in 
color, granular to the touch, has more gluten, and is known 
as a strong flour. Flour from winter wheat is somewhat whiter 
in color and smoother to the touch, feeling more like corn- 
starch, and if a portion is squeezed in the hand, it retains 
the imprint of the fingers. It has less gluten, more starch, 
and is known as a soft flour. This type of flour is some- 
times called " pastry flour," the smaller percentage of gluten 
making it more desirable for pastry or cake than the stronger 
flour. 

Flour manufacturers and bakers are constantly experi- 
menting to find the best possible varieties and combinations 
of varieties for bread flour. Some difference of opinion exists, 



1 U. S. Department of Agriculture, Farmers' Bulletin 389, p. 16. 
O 



194 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



but a combination of winter and spring wheat in flour is 
considered the best for bread by some authorities. 

We must learn to like a creamy color in bread, for this 
means the presence of more gluten. To summarize : a good 
bread flour contains a large percentage of gluten, is creamy 
in color, and granular to the touch. 

Manufacture of flour. Modern machinery has taken the 
place of the old-time stones in the grinding of flour, although 

the two main divisions of the 
process remain the same, these 
being the crushing of the grain 
and the sifting out of the coarse 
portion. Milling now includes 
many stages in the process not 
possible with the cruder ma- 
chinery of former times, and the 
present effects a greater number 
of separations and permits the 
miller to make a greater variety 
of products. 

Figure 53 shows a dissected 
kernel of wheat, with its five 
layers of bran. Within these at 

courtesy of washbum Crosby Co. B is a shell of glutinous matter, 
yellowish and of flinty hardness, 
and within this, but not sharply 
divided from it, lie the starch granules in a network of woody 
fiber, the germ lying at A. The milling process must remove 
the bran coats and the germ, and crush and roll the remain- 
ing portions to the necessary fineness. The germ if allowed 
to remain affects the color and keeping properties. The 
breaking and rolling are accomplished by steel machinery, 
and the final sifting is done through silk bolting cloth. By 




FIG. 53. A dissected grain of 
wheat. 



YEAST BREAD 195 

the new machinery about 70 per cent of the wheat is saved 
for food, 30 per cent being bran, " shorts," and other by- 
products used chiefly for cattle feeding. 

Figure 54 shows the vertical section of a mill, simplified 
in the drawing that all the steps of the process may be clear. 
The diagram does not, of course, show the actual arrange- 
ment of the mill. 1 

The typical parts in a modern flour mill are as follows : 
(1) Scales, for weighing wheat as it is received. (2) Receiv- 
ing separator, for separating other kinds of seeds from wheat. 
(3) Storage bins, for reserve supply of wheat in advance of 
mill requirements. (4) Mill separator, for further separating 
foreign seeds from wheat. (5) Scourer, for removing dust

Other forms of flour. There has been much discussion 
of entire wheat flour versus white flour, and the practical 
conclusions are as follows : the bread from whole wheat 
flour compares favorably with that from white flour (see 
Fig. 51), but this material is slightly less available for 
digestion than the material of the white flour. The mineral 
content is higher, and when the income is so limited that this 
cannot be furnished in milk, green vegetables, and fruit, 
whole wheat bread should be used. It makes a pleasing 
variety, too, for any table. 

Graham flour is a coarse flour, containing the outer bran. 
It is useful for its effect upon the intestines in case of con- 
stipation, but has to be avoided by some people on account 
of its irritating effect. White flour may have coarser mate- 
rial mixed with it, for variety in bread making, such as rye or 
Indian meal, or graham flour. 

Yeast in bread. Yeast is put into bread dough in order 
to produce carbon dioxide gas to lighten the whole mass. It 
is studied in the chapter on preservation of fruit, but in 
bread making we need ;to foster its growth instead of destroy- 
ing it as, you will recall, we found necessary in preserving. 
You can easily reason out for yourself just how this should be 
done, especially after performing the experiments with yeast. 

If yeast is in good condition, it has little effect on the flavor 
of bread, even if used in a rather large quantity to hasten the 
process. 

The best forms of yeast now in use are the compressed 
and dried cakes, the former needing to be fresh, the latter 



198 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

keeping the vitality of the yeast cells for a long time. Liquid 
yeast may be made at home, but it is somewhat uncertain 
unless made with great exactness, and less easy to manage 
on the whole than the other forms. 

Proportions of the ingredients. One part of water to 
three of flour, or one cup to three of flour for a loaf, is an 
average proportion. The practiced bread maker will vary 
this slightly to suit the variations in the flour from time to 
time, but it is a safe rule for the beginner to follow. Winter 
wheat flour requires somewhat more water than the spring 
wheat, or the blend of the two. Salt should be used sparingly, 
for although it improves the flavor of the loaf, salt is a pre- 
servative which retards or prevents the growth of lower 
organisms, and in the case of bread it acts therefore as a 
check to fermentation. One teaspoonful to a loaf is the 
largest amount that it is best to use. 

The quantity of yeast depends upon several conditions. 
The larger the amount of yeast used, the shorter is the time 
of rising, and as many as two compressed yeast cakes may be 
used to one loaf if it is necessary to hasten the process, with- 
out any perceptible effect on the color, texture or flavor. 
If a very large amount of yeast is used, the bread is 
" crumbly," and a difference in flavor will be noticed. A 
smaller amount may be used if time is allowed for the rising, 
even f cake of compressed yeast to a loaf, if the bread is to 
rise over night in warm weather. It must be remembered 
that, if the rising process is too prolonged, other organisms 
have a chance to work, and the bread may sour. 

A small amount of sugar hastens fermentation, and from 
one to two teaspoonfuls to a loaf may be used. Many 
people prefer the flavor of bread with no sugar, however. 
Some bakers use malt extract both as a yeast food to hasten 
fermentation and for its effect upon the flavor.

Fat, or shortening, should be sparingly used, not more than 
one or two teaspoonfuls being allowed to a loaf. If you 
study a number of bread recipes, you will see that this in- 
gredient varies more than the others. As a matter of fact, 
if the flour is of good quality and the bread well made, this 
ingredient is not necessary (in loaf bread at least), although 
it seems to improve the quality of biscuit and rolls. 

Methods of mixing and the rising of bread. Dissolve 
the yeast in a portion of the liquid, stir this mixture into the 
remaining liquid, add half the flour, and beat the mixture 
thoroughly at this stage. Add the sugar if any is to be used. 
When this soft mixture, called the " sponge," becomes full of 
bubbles, add the salt, the shortening if used, and the remain- 
ing flour. Knead the dough by the hand, or by the machine, 
for about ten minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic. 
Put it into a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow the 
dough to remain until it doubles its bulk. Some bread 
makers knead in all the flour at the first, and obtain a good 
result. The first rising is more rapid, however, and expe- 
rience seems to prove that the results are better on the whole 
with the sponge. Cut the dough down, knead again, using 
as little flour as possible. Shape into loaves, place the loaves 
in greased pans, cover, and leave again until the loaves double 
their bulk, when they are ready for baking. If left too long, 
the bubbles of gas become too large. 

Temperature and time are important, in this matter of 
mixing and using. The process may be shortened to five or 
six hours, including the baking, or lengthened to twenty-four 
by the choice of the amount of yeast and the temperature. 
The shorter process is the better, on the whole. After 
reading over the sections of the chapter on preservation of 
fruit, performing the yeast experiments, and discussing the 
results, you will be able to answer these questions : 



YEAST BREAD 201 

1. What should be the temperature of the ingredients when 
the bread is mixed ? 

2. If milk is used, how may the souring of the milk be prevented ? 

3. What temperature will you secure for the bread while it is 
rising ? 

4. If an emergency occurs, and the dough cannot be kneaded 
or baked at the moment it is ready, what can be done? Can you 
think of two expedients? 

A few suggestions. The kneading stretches the gluten 
and long kneading gives a fine grain. In such a recipe as 
that for the making of Parker House rolls, a very delicate 
quality results from a protracted process ; one old-fashioned 
housekeeper recommends a half hour's kneading three times. 
Fortunately a sufficiently good bread or roll may be made 
by ten or fifteen minutes' kneading at a time. 

Bread dough may be cut or stirred with a large knife in 
place of the kneading, and this is a good method to teach to 
those who live in crowded space and find it difficult to have 
a perfectly clean kitchen and proper utensils. With this 
method the dough must be softer, and it remains in the bowl 
until it is turned into the baking pan. The resulting loaf is 
somewhat moist, and not fine-grained, but the flavor is good. 

Brushing the surface of the dough in the bowl or pan with 
water or milk will prevent the formation of a dry crust on the 
top. 

Baking the bread. The temperature of the oven should 
be steady, and about 380 F. An authority recommends 
180 C. (355 F.) when the loaf is put in, rising to 220 C. 
(425 F.). 1 The amount of flour for one loaf has been given. 
A loaf this size should be baked in a pan 8j to 9 inches X 
3i to 4 X 3 to 3|. The material of the pan is not of great 
consequence. Tin gives good results, a longer time being

required for baking in a 
granite pan. A loaf should 
bake about one hour. 
(See Fig. 55.) 

Rolls and biscuit may 
be shaped in many ways. 
(See Fig. 56.) How will 
the baking differ from that 
of the loaf? 

Care of bread after bak- 
ing. Remove from the 
pans, cool on a rack, place 
in tin box or stone jar, and 
cover with paraffin paper. 

Uses of stale bread. 
Bread that has become 
too dry may be freshened 
by moistening the surface 
and heating in the oven. 
Bread may be used for 
toast, croutons for soup, 
escalloped dishes, pud- 
dings, crumbs for coating 
other food materials, and 
may be made into cups for 
holding other materials.

let rise again. Before baking brush over with well beaten egg 
and cover with following mixture. Melt 3 tablespoonfuls 
butter, add 3 cup sugar and 1 teaspoonful cinnamon. When 
sugar is partially melted, add 3 tablespoonfuls flour and remove 
from fire. 

7. Toast. Directions for making toast will be found in Chapter 
IV. 

To serve toast. Toast should be served as soon as it is made, 
if possible, and if not must be kept hot. Fold it in a napkin. 
Toast may also be buttered, piled neatly on a plate, and kept 
hot in the oven until it is time for serving. 

For milk toast the bread is cut somewhat thicker than for 
buttered toast. The milk is prepared by thickening, No. 1 under 
White Sauce. Dip each slice of toast in the thickened milk 
and then put the slices in a dish for serving and pour the thick- 
ened milk over. To moisten toast that is too dry, or when 
moist toast is wanted to serve under some other food, place it 
in a steamer or colander over boiling water a few minutes be- 



Laboratory management. For individual work or for work in groups of 
two, the use of ^ cup of liquid will be found to make as small an amount 
of dough as it is desirable to handle. In making the white bread two por- 
tions may be baked in one tin, brushing with butter where the two por- 
tions touch each other, so that the loaves will separate when baked. 

Where it is necessary to hurry the process not less than | yeast cake 
should be used with this quantity. 

It is impossible in an ordinary school period to complete the entire pro- 
cess. A number of solutions will occur to the teacher. One of these is to 
arrange the lessons as follows : 
Lesson I. 

Yeast experiments, summary, bread mixed in groups and set to rise, 
demonstration by teacher of kneading, using dough previously prepared. 

Lesson II.

fore buttering it. This is much better than toast moistened 
with boiling water. 

8. The sandwich. The sandwich is a convenient way of serving 

bread and other foods away from the table, for picnics, teas, 
and receptions. 

To prepare the bread. Either white or brown bread may 
be used. Select a well-shaped loaf of fine grain that will not 
crumb when it is sliced. Cut off the end of the loaf, spread 
the loaf evenly with butter, cut a thin slice, butter again, and 
so on. The butter should be softened. Be careful to spread 
it evenly and see that it is near the edge of the bread. Sand- 
wiches may be made either with or without the crust. If the 
crust is to be removed, cut it off the loaf before buttering and 
slicing. 

The filling. There is an endless variety of filling pos- 
sible for sandwiches, from slices of meat and poultry, which 
make a substantial luncheon for picnics, to the dainty fillings 
used for afternoon teas and receptions. A crisp bit of lettuce 
leaf with Mayonnaise dressing is always acceptable. Cream 
cheese mixed with nuts and raisins is a good filling. For a 
sweet sandwich, jam or jelly may be spread on the slices and 
possibly a small amount of cream cheese put between. You 
can invent many combinations. 

The shape of the sandwich may be oblong, triangular, or round. 
The round sandwich is cut with a sharp cooky cutter. The 
pieces remaining may be dried and used for bread crumbs. 
The crusts may always be utilized in this way. 

9. Croutons. Cut a slice of bread a day old \ inch thick. Spread 

with soft butter, cut off the crust, put the slices in a pan, 
cut in cubes and set the pan in the oven until the croutons are 
brown.

CHAPTER XIII 
MEATS AND POULTRY 

THE meats that we commonly use are derived from the 
flesh of domestic and wild animals of herbiverous habits 
and from fowls. The flesh of carnivorous 
animals is seldom used as food. The vari- 
ous kinds are obtained as follows : 



Meat 

Beef 

Veal 

Mutton 

Lamb 

Pork 

Ham and bacon 

Venison 



Animal 

Ox 

Calf 
Sheep 

Young sheep 
Pig 

Pig 
Deer 




Under the head of poultry we include the 
common fowl, turkeys, ducks and geese, 
the guinea hen, and game birds. 

Quality of good meat. The quality of 
meat is dependent on the condition of the 
animal from which it is derived. The crea- FIG. 57. Fiber cells 
ture should be in perfect health and well 
fed. Good beef is largely obtained from 
the cattle ranges of the West, but there is no reason why 
cattle should not be raised to greater extent in the East.

too severe. Methods of slaughter, transportation, and pres-

ervation all affect the quality of beef. The pure food laws 
and Federal meat inspection law are valuable to the consumer 
in their control of the quality of the meat, that it shall be 
free from disease and from adulterations. See Chapter XVII 
for the discussion of preservatives and pure food laws.

In meat as it is purchased we have bone, fat, and the 
flesh, consisting of the muscle of the animal with its con- 
nective tissue. The color of the meat should be clear and 
fairly bright, not purplish or dull. There should be little 
or no odor, and the meat should be firm and elastic to the 
touch. 

Beef should be a bright red and well streaked with fat. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 



211 



Veal should be pink and is some- 
what less firm than beef If watery 
and flabby, it is too young. 

Mutton is a duller red, and firm. 
The fat is white or slightly yellow 
and hard. 

Lamb is pink, rather than red, 
and slightly less firm. 

Pork is rather pale, somewhat 
less firm than beef and mutton, and 
the fat is softer. 

Tough and tender meat. To 
understand the difference between 
the tough and tender cuts we must 
be familiar with the structure of the 
muscle (see Fig. 57). Each muscle 
consists of bundles of tubes held 
together by connective tissue. In 
tough meat, the muscle tubes are 
thicker and there is more connective 
tissue present. Exercise strength- 
ens the muscle, and this accounts 
for the fact that the unexercised 
muscles of the young animal give 
us a softer meat. In the mature 
animal the muscles most exercised 
furnish the tough meat, and the 
less used muscles the tender. If 
you study Fig. 58, you can easily 
determine where the tough meat 
will occur, if you think of the proportionate amount of 
exercise that the different muscles receive. The tough cuts 
come from the neck and legs, the tender cuts from the middle

of the back, the toughness increasing as the cuts approach 
the neck and the hind legs. The muscles of the abdomen 
are also tender, but they give a coarse-grained meat. The 
various cuts of meat are shown as they occur in the standing 
animal in Fig. 58, and in the hind and fore quarters hanging, in 
Figs. 59 and 60. The individual cuts of beef and mutton are 
shown in the figures that follow. The tender cuts from the 
ribs and loin are the most highly prized, and therefore bring 
the highest price. These cuts are liked because of their ten- 
derness although the nutritive value of the tough meat is as 
high or possibly even higher than that of the tender. All 
meat is now high priced, and you will find the reasons for 
this discussed in Chapter XVII. For the sake of economy we 
are forced to use the relatively cheaper cuts, and to seek for 
meat substitutes. We must also take pains to use the cook- 
ing processes that will make the tough meats palatable. 

Composition and nutritive value. Figure 64 shows you 
the composition of several common meats. Meat is valuable 
chiefly for its protein, fat, and mineral salts. The juices of 
the meat in the muscle cells contain nitrogenous extractive 
materials which give flavor, and are possibly stimulating, 
but they have no food value. From the bone and also from 
the connective tissue, gelatin is dissolved in cooking. Gela- 
tin is a protein, but differs in certain chemical properties 
from other proteins, and cannot be used as the only source of 
nitrogen. It is a very useful protein, however, and as it can 
be substituted in part for more expensive proteins, it used 
to be called a " protein saver." 

In spite of the fact that meat is a common article of diet 
it should not be used in excess. Other forms of protein, as 
those in eggs and milk, are usually digested as easily, and 
most people can digest vegetable proteins if the vegetables 
are carefully prepared. Very little children should not have 



214 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT

216 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



meat, for it has stimulating properties which are undesirable 
for them, and it takes away the taste for foods more important 
for growth (see Food for Growth, Chapter XVIII). When 
used largely in the diet, meat tends to cause intestinal putre- 
faction and to form excess of acid in the body. It is less 
likely to be harmful if taken with plenty of fruits and green 
vegetables and liberal drinking of clear water. 

It should be realized that in none of the European coun- 
tries is meat used so liberally as in the United States, and 
that there are reasons to believe that we might be better off 
if we could satisfy ourselves with a meat consumption nearer 
the average of other civilized peoples say half as much 
meat per person per year as we are now accustomed to use. 
The fuel value of meat depends largely upon the amount of 
fat which is eaten. If a pound of steak contains 2 ounces of 
fat and 14 ounces of clear lean; the rejection of the fat means 
a loss of fully one half of the fuel value. The following table 
shows the difference between raw meat of the same cut, free 
from bones and connective tissue, due to differences in amounts 
of fat. Most people would prefer the strictly lean meat.

Dangers from meat. Three dangers from meat must be 
recognized; (1) animal parasites, such as the trichina some- 
times found in pork, (2) poisons developed in the meat by 
bacteria when it is kept too long or without sufficient refrigera- 
tion, this danger being recognized as ptomaine poisoning, 
(3) bacteria, sometimes present in meat, which are directly 
injurious to man and which are now held to be the cause of 
most of the sickness commonly attributed to ptomaine 
poisoning. Government protection must be given us here, 
but the housekeeper too has a responsibility. If the raw meat 
has failed to receive proper inspection, we can protect our- 
selves by cooking the meat to a degree that will kill any 
parasite present. For this reason meat should not be served 
that looks raw or too underdone. The cooked meat should 
be pink rather than red. 

Meat poisoning may be avoided in the first place by exer- 
cising great care in regard to the odor of meat. Meat may 
hang to " ripen/' as the butchers say, but one must learn to 
distinguish between the odor of properly ripened meat, and 
that of even slightly tainted meat. Quite as important is 
the rapid cooling of meat, poultry, fish, and soups that are 
not to be used at once. Cases of digestive disturbance and 
even actual poisoning sometimes occur when underdone 
meat, especially lamb, veal, or poultry, remains warm over- 
night. 

The effect of heat upon meat. The fat of meat is 
melted by heat. The meat fiber shrinks and hardens

with intense heat ; on the other hand it softens at a 
temperature somewhat below the boiling point of water. 
The structure of the muscle must be studied further in order 
to make the principles of cooking perfectly clear. If you 
think of the structure of the muscle cell as somewhat 
resembling the structure of an orange, you can picture quite 
clearly what happens under different conditions. Open a 
section of orange and separate some of the single cells. These 
may represent the muscle cells of meat that can be seen only 
under the microscope. If you cut across one of these tiny 
cells, the contents will escape, and this is what happens when 
the muscle cells are cut across. Then, too, if the muscle is 
heated, the juices will pass through the membrane of the 
cell, and this happens, too, if the meat is put into cold water. 
The substances in the juices of the meat which are not 
coagulated by heat are called the extractives, because they 
can be extracted by hot water. The most valuable protein 
matter remains behind in the muscle cell, however. Among 
these proteins are those known as meat albumin, and this 
behaves in cooking very much as does the white of egg, 
that is to say, it coagulates. 

Bearing these facts in mind, we can decide just what to do 
in order to bring about the result that we desire in meat 
cookery, for sometimes we wish to extract the juices and 
" sometimes we wish to have all, or nearly all, retained in the 
meat. We are now ready to state the principles of meat 
cookery as follows : 

1. Juices retained. 

In broiling, pan broiling, roasting, and boiling the high 
temperature coagulates the meat albumin and hardens the 
fiber on the surface, thus forming a coating which prevents 
the further escape of juices. In the roasting and boiling of 



MEATS AND POULTRY 221 

large pieces the temperature may then be lowered to pre- 
vent the further shrinking and hardening of the fiber in the 
interior of the meat, which comes from a protracted high 
temperature. With a very thick steak after the surface 
searing the cooking may be completed in the oven. 

2. Juices extracted. 

In beef juice or beef tea, this may be made by placing 
the chopped beef in a jar and placing the jar in an oven, or 
in hot water ; or for beef tea and ordinary soup by putting 
the chopped meat, or small pieces of meat, in cold water and 
heating the water slowly. 

3. Juices partly retained and partly extracted. 

This is desirable in stews, in braised beef, and in pot roast. 
State for yourself just how this would be accomplished. 

4. Connective tissue softened at low temperature, and with 

water. 

5. Sterilization by continued heat which destroys parasites 

and bacteria. 

6. Rapid cooling, when serving is not immediate. 

Flavors suitable with meat. 

Herbs. All the pot herbs including savory, marjoram, thyme, 
sage, pot marigold. 

Vegetables. Onion,* carrot, turnip, celery, celery root, parsley- 
root and leaf. 

Spices. Clove, allspice, mustard, red, black, and white pepper. 
Some nationalities use nutmeg. 

Acids. Lemon, tomato, and other acid fruits. 

EXPERIMENTS AND RECIPES 

Experiment A. 

Chop finely a small piece of meat, squeeze out the juice with a 
lemon squeezer and heat this juice in a saucepan. Observe the 
coagulation that takes place. 



222 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Experiment B. 

(1) Apparatus. If possible, 2 glass beakers, 1 square wire 
net. If these are not available, use an ordinary tumbler and a 
small saucepan. 

(2) Method. a. Put a small piece of meat in a beaker with 
cold water, and allow it to stand. 

b. Bring water to the boiling point in the beaker on the net 
over the gas flame. Throw in a small piece of meat. 

Compare the appearance of the two pieces of meat and the water 
in the two beakers. 

1. Broiled steak. (1) Wipe steak with a damp cloth. If a wood 

or coal stove is used, have a bed of glowing coals ready. If 
gas is used, have the gas broiler thoroughly heated. Grease 
the bars of the broiler. Place steak in the broiler and sear meat 
first on one side, then on the other. Continue to turn the 
broiler and cook the meat until it is brown and done according 
to taste. Steak an inch thick will take about ten minutes to 
be cooked to a medium degree. Chops are broiled in the same 
way. 

(2) Steak and chops may also be broiled in the pan. An 
iron frying pan is the best utensil. Heat the pan, and brush 
it over with a small piece of fat cut from the steak or the 
chops. The purpose of this is merely to keep the meat from 
sticking to the pan. The principle of procedure is the same as 
with (1). The steak or chops must be frequently turned, 
using a knife and a fork, being careful not to prick the meat 
with the fork. The length of time is slightly longer than 
for (1). This method must not be confused with the frying 
of steak in a pan with a large amount of *fat. By this method 
the steak is not fried, and it is often a convenient substitute 
for (1). 

2. Roast of beef. Wipe roast with a damp cloth. Sprinkle with 

salt and dredge with flour. Place in a roasting pan, fat side 
up if it is a standing roast. Put the roast in a very hot 
oven and after fifteen minutes reduce the heat. Baste roast 
two or three times with the fat that tries out during cooking. 
The usual allowance of time for a medium rare roast is fifteen 
minutes for every pound of meat. 

Roast beef gravy. After the roast has been taken from the 



MEATS AND POULTRY 223 

pan, pour out all but 1 tablespoonfuls of the melted fat. Stir 
in 1 heaping tablespoonful of flour and brown very slightly. 
Add one cup of cold water and stir constantly until thickened. 
Add ^ teaspoonful salt. Strain. 

Bouillon. 

Shin of beef 6 pounds Parsley 2 sprigs 

Cold water 3 quarts Carrot 1 

Peppercorns \ teaspoonful Turnip ' \ cup each 

Cloves 6 Onion j cut in dice 

Bay leaf \ Celery J 

Thyme 3 sprigs Salt 1 tablespoonful 

Marjoram 1 sprig 

Wipe beef and cut the lean meat in inch cubes. Brown one 
third of the meat in fat cut from meat or marrow from a mar- 
row bone. Put remaining two thirds with bone and fat in 
soup kettle, add water and let stand for thirty minutes. Place 
on back of range, add browned meat, and heat gradually to 
the boiling point. Cover and cook slowly six hours, keeping 
below the boiling point during cooking. Add the vegetables 
and seasonings, cook one and one half hours, strain and cool as 
quickly as possible. This is called soup stock. 

To clarify bouillon. When stock is cold, remove fat 
which has hardened on top and put quantity to be cleared into 
a stew pan. Allow white and shell of one egg to each quart of 
stock. Put over fire and stir constantly until boiling point 
is reached. Boil two minutes. Set back on stove and let 
simmer twenty minutes. Remove scum and strain through 
double thickness of cheesecloth. 

General directions for meat soups. Soup making is an art that 
is well worth cultivating. The expert soup maker will obtain 
delicious flavors by adding bits of many kinds of left overs 
almost anything that is found in the refrigerator in the way of 
fruit, vegetables, and pieces of meat. With the coming of the 
gas stove, many people have given up soup making. These 
various left overs add much to the flavor of the soup and 
can be used in a thickened soup which is like the bouillon 
strained and thickened. The thickening may be flour, arrow- 
root, cold cereal, sago, tapioca, or rice. Spaghetti, vermicelli, 



224 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

and fancy forms of paste are sometimes served. Vegetables 
may be cut into dice or fancy shapes and served in the clear 
soup. A great variety is possible in flavoring and serving soup 
if one will take the trouble to make it an art. 

Soup meat may be served in a soup of the old-fashioned 
kind, thickened and containing vegetables. In such a soup some 
fat is left, and the total result is a dish that makes a meal when 
served with bread. 

When the soup is a clear soup, the meat that is left may be 
used for made over dishes; although some practical house- 
keepers think that it costs almost as much to make it palatable 
as to buy fresh meat. Try it in an escalloped dish with plenty 
of tomato, onion, and some dried herb's for additional flavor. 

5. Beef stew with dumplings. 

Lean meat 3 pounds 

Potatoes 4 cups, cut in J inch sttees 

Turnip 1 f cup each, cut in half inch 

Carrot J cubes 

Onion | small one, cut in thin 

slices 

Flour \ cup 
Salt 
Pepper 

Wipe meat, cut in 1| inch cubes, sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, and dredge with flour. Cut some of the fat in small 
pieces and try out in frying pan. Add meat and stir con- 
stantly, that the surface may be quickly seared. When well 
browned, put in kettle, and rinse frying pan with boiling water, 
that none of the flavor may be lost. Cover with boiling water 
and boil five minutes, then cook below the boiling point until 
meat is tender (about 3 hours). Add vegetables except potatoes 
and seasoning the last hour of cooking. Parboil potatoes five 
minutes and add to stew 15 minutes before taking from fire. 



TEACHER'S NOTE. Broiled steak would be suitable for group work, 
using small steaks (Delmonico cut). A small roast may be prepared by a 
group and roasted after class. This meat and that left from the steak should 
be used in a subsequent class for a lesson on left over meat. Broiled or 
pan-broiled chops may be prepared individually.

Mix and sift dry ingredients. Work in butter with a knife, 
add milk gradually. Remove enough liquid from stew so that 
when dumplings are dropped in they will rest on top of meat. 
Drop by spoonfuls and let cook about twenty minutes. 

The stew should be thickened before dumplings are 
dropped in. 

7. Uses of left over meat. 

(1) Rissoles. Run meat together with small piece of onion 
through a chopper. Add salt, pepper, a little cold cereal, 
or bread crumbs, and beaten egg, allowing one egg to about a 
pound of meat. Shape into flat round cakes, roll in flour and 
saute in butter until well browned. These may be served 
with tomato sauce. 

Tomato Sauce. 

Onion 1 teaspoonful chopped 

Salt | teaspoonful

(2) Croquettes. 

Cold meat or chicken 2 cups 

Salt ^ teaspoonful 

Pepper f teaspoonful 

Cayenne Few grains 

Onion juice Few drops 

White sauce 1 cup, thick, hot 

Beaten egg 

Dried bread crumbs 

Mix ingredients in order given and let mixture cool. Shape

place in a frying basket and fry in deep fat to a golden brown. 

(3) Escalloped meat 
Cold meat 

Bread crumbs, soft 2 cups 

Onion 1 slice, chopped fine 

Salt teaspoonful 

Mixed poultry seasoning 1 tablespoonful 
A little chopped celery is desirable 

This is a simple method of serving left over meat that needs 
no specific recipe. Layers of bread crumbs are alternated with 
layers of meat which may be chopped or cut into small pieces. 
Liquid may be used like tomato or tomato juice, or soup that 
is left over, or plain water. The flavor may be varied by the 
use of the different materials that are suitable to meat. Layers 
of mashed potato may be used instead of bread. 

POULTRY 

In selecting poultry see that the flesh is firm, that there is 
a good amount of fat underneath the skin, and that the skin 
is whole and a good yellow. Notice the odor of the fowl 
particularly. The skin of cold-storage poultry has not such 
a good color and is sometimes broken. Often the flesh is 
shrunken, and if the cold storage has been too long continued 
the odor is unpleasant. Refrigeration is allowable for a 
period. Another way to judge cold-storage poultry is by 



MEATS AND POULTRY 227 

the price. Well-fed poultry freshly killed brings a high 
market price and a bargain quite often proves to be poultry 
too long in cold storage. Good quality poultry is at present 
a high-priced food. 

To prepare poultry for cooking, the " dressing " of the 
chicken is often done now at the market. If it is necessary 
to do this at home, make an incision with a sharp knife just 
inside of one of the legs, in the groin. Insert the hand and 
remove all the entrails. The skin must be loosened at the 
neck and the crop removed. In any case, wash the chicken 
thoroughly inside and out, even holding the cavity under 
running water. If there is hair remaining on the chicken, 
singe this off over burning paper or over a gas flame. 

The composition is essentially the same as that of meat. 
The white of chicken, fowls, and turkeys is thought to be 
more digestible than the dark meat. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The principles of cookery are the same as with the meat. Chicken 
soup is made on the same principle as beef soup. After straining, 
it is delicious with the addition of milk or cream. The meat of the 
chicken may be chopped fine and used as a thickening. Rice may 
be added or a hard-boiled egg chopped fine. 

Chicken may be served cold, for luncheon or supper, and is 
always very desirable in made-over dishes. Any stuffing left over 
may be used in the made dishes. 

i. Roast chicken. Dress and clean a chicken. Fill the cavity with 
stuffing and sew edges together. Truss chicken and place on 
its back in a roasting pan. Rub surface with salt and spread 
breast and legs with butter. Dredge with flour. Put a little 
water in bottom of pan. Place in hot oven and when flour is 
well browned, reduce the temperature. Baste frequently during 
roasting with liquid in pan. When breast meat is tender and 
a brown crust formed the bird is cooked. A four-pound chicken 
requires about 1| hours. 



228 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Stuffing. (See recipe for stuffing, page 237.) 

Mix all together. No moisture need be added as the 
juices of the chicken will be sufficient. 

Gravy. Pour off liquid from pan in which chicken has 
been roasted. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of either chicken fat or 
butter. Stir in 2 tablespoonfuls of flour and let bubble 
up. Add one cup stock, in which giblets, neck, and tips 
of wings have been cooked, and stir steadily until thick- 
ened. Add \ teaspoonful salt. 

2. Chicken fricassee. Clean and cut up a fowl. Cover with 
boiling water and let boil 5 minutes. Simmer until meat is 
tender. Remove chicken from kettle and place pieces in hot, 
greased frying pan. Saute until browned. Put on platter. 
Melt 4 tablespoonfuls chicken fat in pan. Add 4 tablespoon- 
fuls flour. Stir and let bubble up. Add 2 cups chicken 
stock, stir and let boil until thickened. Pour over chicken 
on platter. 

Preserved meats and poultry. Smoked and salted meats 
are valuable foods, although the nutritive content is some- 
what less available for digestion. The salted and smoked 
mea^ts need long and slow cooking below the boiling tem- 
perature of water. 

Canned meats and poultry of good quality are now in the 
market, and they are convenient and useful when not 
used to excess. Buy well-known brands. The govern- 
ment inspection of canned meats is of great importance, 
for the individual cannot protect himself. Canned soups 
are convenient for those who cook by gas and who live 
in small quarters. Buy good brands even if they are some- 
what more expensive. The best firms manufacturing canned 



Laboratory management. A lesson on poultry is a very expensive one and 
difficult to manage so that each may have a share of the work. Such a lesson 
is suitable where the pupils have had work in previous years and are used to 
working in groups. 



MEATS AND POULTRY 229 

soup are scrupulously clean in their methods and pride 
themselves on using good material. 

Other parts of meat and poultry. Some of the internal 
organs of the animals and fowl are used for food. Most 
of them are comparatively cheap, and may be made palat- 
able. 

The liver and kidneys are organs having to do with the waste 
products of the body and objection is raised to their use on that ac- 
count. If used, they should be soaked in cold salted water, put 
into fresh cold water, and allowed to heat very slowly. This 
water should be poured off, and then a brown stew can be made. 
What flavors are pleasant with liver and kidneys? 

Make your own recipe for liver or kidney stew. 

The heart does not contain waste products. Why is it tough? 
What process would you select to make it tender? Even when 
softened, it would' not be attractive or very palatable without 
further treatment. It is hollow, somewhat as the chicken is before 
roasting. Look over the recipes and flavors suitable to meat and 
see if you cannot make your own for Baked Heart. 

Sweetbreads, the pancreas, are highly prized on account of their 
delicacy, and are costly. They may be broiled, or served in sauce 
in pastry cases or in patties. 

Calf's head and brain.. The brain is sometimes used as substi- 
tute for sweetbreads. From the meat and bones of the head soup 
and stew may be made.

CHAPTER XIV 
FISH, SHELLFISH, AND OTHER MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

FISH and shellfish are valuable assets as food, so much so 
that the government has a Bureau of Fisheries, and has es- 
tablished stations at intervals on the coast and on inland 
lakes for the study and production of those foods that come 
from salt and fresh water. We have used these products of 
the waters as if the supply were limitless, forgetting that fish 
and shellfish are living creatures with habits that we cannot 
ignore without working havoc to the species. Young salmon 
and shad are hatched in the upper reaches of the rivers, and 
if we insist on trapping the mature fish at the river mouth on 
their northern migrations, the number of young decreases, 
and salmon and shad become high-priced foods. To ignore 
fishery and game laws is an ignorant and dishonest proceed- 
ing, with far-reaching economic results. 

Varieties of fish. In Bulletin No. 28 of the Office of 
Experiment Stations, United States Department of Agri- 
culture, forty-four different fish are listed, all used as food. 
A visit to the fish stall in the market of a seaboard city will 
acquaint you with many interesting species. Fresh and salt 
water fish differ in flavor, and there is a difference to be de- 
tected between fish from running, or from lake water, brook 
trout, for instance, having a superior flavor. The food supply 
also influences the flavor, and both fresh and salt water fish 
have a better flavor when taken from sandy and rocky 
bottoms rather than muddy. The habit of the fish also has

an effect on the quality and taste. The chequit, for instance, 
is so sluggish and easy to catch that it is sometimes called 
" lazy " or " weakfish," and it is watery and poor flavored 
compared with the shad, a fish of more vigorous habits. The 
amount of fat also causes a difference in flavor, such high 
flavored fish as salmon and shad containing much fat. The 
distinctive flavors of mackerel and herring are apparently not 
due to fat, since their fat content is not particularly high. 
Among the most common and best liked fish are bass, black- 
fish, bluefish, cod, flounder, haddock, halibut, herring, 
mackerel, porgy (sometimes called scup or scuppaug), 
salmon, shad, smelt, weakfish, whitefish. Brook trout and 
salmon trout are luxuries. 

Composition and nutritive value. Figure 65 shows the 
composition of several kinds. Compare their composition 
with that of meat. The nutritive content is high, yet fish 
seems a lighter and less satisfying food than meat, although 
on the seaboard of some countries it is the chief animal food. 
The digestibility of fish and meat are about equal, but some 
varieties of fish are less digestible than others, this being 
true of the oily and strong-flavored fish, herring, mackerel, 
salmon, and shad. 

There are popular prejudices for and against fish that are 
not warranted. The idea that fish is a " brain food " be- 
cause it contains phosphorus was exploded long since, for 
fish contains no more phosphorus than some other foods, 
and phosphorus is no more valuable to the brain than to the 
other tissues. 

Fish, however, is valuable in the dietary for supplying 
protein and giving variety, and in season, it is one of the 
cheaper foods. 

Quality of fish. Fish deteriorates and decomposes much 
more rapidly than meat, and is at its best when cleaned and 



234 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

cooked just after being caught. Ice will preserve fish for a 
short time only. If ever on a camping trip you have eaten 
bluefish caught in the surf, or trout from the brook, cooked 
immediately, you know what flavor a fish may have. Fish 
should be killed immediately, and put on ice if they are 
not to be cooked at once. If there is no ice, clean the fish, 
sprinkle the flesh with pepper and salt, wrap in a wet cloth, 
and set in a breeze or draught. 

When fish are transported over long distances they should be 
packed in ice in refrigerator cars, and you will notice that the 
fishman in the shop keeps the fish on ice until he sells 
them. 

In selecting fish, see that the flesh feels firm and that the 
eyes are still bright. If you have a keen sense of smell, 
this will also guide you, although to the novice the odor of 
fish may be disagreeable even if untainted. 

Fish in season and caught plentifully near by, are of good 
quality and should be cheap. Shad and salmon have their 
season in the spring, bluefish come north in the summer, 
sometimes as late as August, porgies are a summer and au- 
tumn fish, and smelt are abundant in the winter. Deep- 
sea fish like cod and halibut have a long season, and may be 
bought at any time. 



GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

The scaling and cleaning of fish are important first steps. In the 
city this may be done for you at the market, but sometimes on 
fishing expeditions when you are not a successful fisher you may 
make yourself useful by cleaning the fish. Clean the fish on a 
large piece of paper. Use a sharp strong knife, and rub off the 
scales from the tail to the head. To skin a fish well, you should 
first watch an expert. Cut through the skin of the back and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 235 

abdomen, loosen it at the tail and pull it off. Remove the head, 
open the abdomen, and take out the entrails. Burn the paper 
on which the fish has been cleaned. Fish is boned by slitting the 
flesh down the back, and patiently separating the flesh from the 
side bones, and finally pulling out the spine and attached bones. 
The strong odor of fish clings to everything the fish touches. Wash 
the fish, the knife, and your own hands in cold water and salt. 
Always pour the water in which fish is washed or cooked down the 
sink at once, pour in some salt, arid flush the trap with cold water. 
The utensils, and dishes in which fish is served, need very careful 
washing in several waters. 

The connective tissue of fish softens and dissolves more readily 
than does that of meat. Fish varies in the dryness of the flesh, but 
there is no such thing as tough fish, and the texture of the muscles 
is about the same in all parts of the fish, although there is a differ- 
ence in flavor in the dark and white flesh when these both occur. 
On account of this -characteristic of the connective tissue the fish 
'* falls apart " and our aim must be to prevent this. 

Principles of cooking. 

1. The protein is affected as in all other foods where it occurs. 

2. The fat is melted. 

3. Connective tissue quickly softened. 

To avoid the breaking of the fish it may be wrapped in cloth for 
boiling, and the water should simmer only. The coating of small 
fish or slices of large fish with beaten egg and crumbs tends to hold 
it together. In all cases avoid overcooking. Fish is done when 
a fork easily pierces it and separates the flakes of flesh from the 
bone. 

i. Boiled fish. Use thick pieces of large fish for boiling, or 
if small fish are used they may be boiled whole. Add salt and 
vinegar to water in proportion of 1 tablespoonful of salt and 
two of vinegar to three quarts of water. Use enough water 
to cover the fish. Wrap the fish in cheesecloth to prevent 
breaking apart, and plunge into boiling water. Do not let 
the water boil after fish is in. The fish is done when the flesh 
leaves the bone or when the flesh flakes apart easily. The usual 
time for a thick piece is 30-40 minutes.

Mock Hollandaise sauce. 

Butter 3 tablespoonfuls 

Flour 3 tablespoonfuls 

Eggs 2 

Milk 2 cups 

Salt 1 teaspoonful 

Lemon i to 1. 

Make as for white sauce, adding the beaten eggs just before 
taking from fire and stirring until well thickened. Add lemon 
juice just before serving. This sauce is suitable for boiled fish and 
vegetables. 

2. Left over fish. Fish may be picked apart, mixed with cream 

sauce, and served as creamed fish or served as an escallop. 

Escalloped fish. 

2 cups left over fish, picked over and freed of bones. 
1 cup thin white sauce, dried bread crumbs buttered. 

Butter a baking dish and line with crumbs. Add a layer 
of fish, using half, and cover with half the sauce. Cover with 
a layer of crumbs. Add another layer of fish, sauce, and 
crumbs, making this last layer of crumbs quite thick. Place 
in a hot oven and leave until crumbs are brown and fish is 
heated through. 

To butter crumbs. 

Melt a little butter in a saucepan and turn the crumbs 
in, stirring them over and over with a spoon until all the 
crumbs are coated. 

3. Baked fish. Almost any medium sized fish is suitable for bak- 

ing. The favorites are bluefish, shad, haddock, and halibut, 
sliced. 

Clean the fish, seeing that all scales are removed. Stuff and 
sew. Shape with skewers to form a letter S and place upright on 
a baking pan or lay fish on side. If the fish is not a fat kind, put 
strips of salt pork over it and in pan or cut gashes in fish and 
lay strips of pork in them. Dredge with flour. Bake one 
hour for a three-pound fish, in a hot oven, basting frequently 
with the tried-out fat. Serve with drawn butter or Hollandaise 
sauce.

4. Creamed codfish. Soak the fish in cold water, and pull it apart 

with knife and fork. Put it in a saucepan of cold water, 
allow the water to heat slowly, and stop the heating just 
before the water reaches the boiling point. Pour off the water, 
shake the saucepan over the fire, add a thin white sauce, No. 2, 
and reheat. Serve on toast if desired. 

5. Codfish balls or cakes. 

Ingredients. 

Codfish, picked 1 cup 

Potatoes, cut in cubes 2 cups 

Egg 1 

Salt, if needed to taste 

Flour for dredging 
Method. 

Put the fish and potatoes in a stewpan, cover with cold 
water, bring the water to the boiling point, and cook until 
the potato is tender. The whole process will take about 20 
minutes. Drain off the water very thoroughly and shake the 
stewpan over the fire to dry the contents. It is very neces- 
sary to have the mixture free from water. Mash and heat 
the mixture in the stewpan, and add the egg. Taste to see 
if more salt is needed, as is sometimes the case. Finish as 
follows : 

(a) Shape into round flat cakes about an inch thick, dredge 
with flour and saute. 



Laboratory management. For individual work or work in groups of two, 
small fish, as perch, may be procured and these may be stuffed and baked

(6) The same, browning the cakes on a greased pan in the 
oven, or under the gas flame, turning if necessary. 

(c) Shape in balls, place these in a wire frying basket, lower 
the basket into hot fat 'until the balls brown, lift the basket, 
drain, and drain the balls on paper. Keep hot until it is time 
to serve. 

SHELLFISH 

The shellfish are of two classes ; the mollusks including 
clams, mussels (seldom used in this country), oysters, and 
scallops, and the crustaceans, lobsters and crabs. None 
of the mollusks have high nutritive value, but they are a 
protein food, and add to the variety of the diet. The com- 
position of the oyster is shown in Fig. 65, and it will be noted 
that the fat percentage is small and the calorie value low. 

The oyster is raised in beds in the ocean, or bays often near 
the river mouth, and it is the neighborhood to the river that 
makes it possible for the oyster to carry germs of contagion, 
particularly of typhoid fever, when city sewage poured into 
the river passes over the oyster bed. Here, too, government 
protection is essential, and this is a matter that has created 
so much excitement that conditions are already improved. 
There is an association of oyster growers who make a point 
of advertising clean oyster beds, and cleanly methods of 
handling and transporting. 

Oysters vary in size and flavor, the flavor seeming to de- 
pend upon the locality. The smaller are sought for serving 
raw, and the medium and larger for cooking. They are sold 
by the measure or number when taken from the shell, the 
latter giving the surer quantity ; and the price is usually one 
cent apiece. They are in season from September to May. 
The whole flesh of the oyster is soft and edible, even the 
muscle by which it opens and shuts its shell being tender. 

Clams are of two kinds, distinguished differently in differ- 
ent places. They are known as hard and soft, or round and 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 239 

long, and in Rhode Island the hard round clam still bears the 
Indian name Quahaug, the soft shell clam being the only 
" clam." 

The long clam lies buried in the soft mud of creeks and 
muddy shores left exposed at low tide, when they are dug by 
hoes from the mud. The round clam lies on the bottom of 
shallow warm waters, and is raked with an implement made 
for the purpose. The round clam is used when very young 
and small in place of raw oysters; but both kinds when 
matured have a tough portion that is not softened in cooking, 
and that is more or less indigestible. The long " neck " 
which protrudes from the shell has to be discarded. 

Both kinds may be roasted in the shell, and are very palat- 
able served hot with melted butter, salt, and pepper. They 
are most commonly used in soups and in chowder. They are 
purchased by the quantity or number, are cheaper than oys- 
ters, and are always in season. 

Scallops, as purchased, are only a part of the animal in the 
shell, consisting solely of the round white muscle which op- 
erates the shell. The escallop, or scallop, is migratory, mov- 
ing by a shooting motion, the mature scallops reaching the 
creeks and shores in the autumn, and though found in so- 
called beds they are not fixtures like the oysters. The flavor 
is sweet, and they have a quality that makes them more or 
less indigestible, especially when fried. They are very 
palatable and more digestible served in a stew made like an 
oyster stew. They are sold by the measure and are cheap 
in season. 

The lobster is now a luxury, for methods of catching in the 
past have made them scarce in their old haunts. The lobster 
is a much more highly developed animal than the mollusk, 
having strong muscles inside its coat of mail, and the flesh 
has a protein content that compares very favorably with 



240 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



meat. When fresh, and not served with rich sauces or eaten 
at irregular hours, it is not especially indigestible, and may 
be the main dish at luncheon or supper, served simply with 
salt, pepper, and melted butter and not taken with meat 
foods. Its own delicious flavor needs no addition in the way 
of sauces and high seasoning. 

The crab is essentially like the lobster, being smaller, and 
having a sweeter flavor. The soft shell crab is caught just 
as the old shell is shed, and is highly esteemed as a delicacy. 
Both lobsters and crabs are cooked in the shell, and if al- 
lowed to die naturally before cooking they are uneatable. 
They may be purchased alive or cooked, and one is surer of 
their condition when they are bought alive. Twenty-five 
cents a pound is now an average price for lobsters in shell. 
Crabs are somewhat less expensive at times, but soft shells 
are always high-priced. 

The following table shows the food value of a few of this 
group in terms of the weight of the 100-Calorie portion.

Preserved fish and shellfish. Smoking and salting are 
two old-time methods that are still in use, and smoked salmon, 
herring, and finnan haddie furnish us well-flavored foods at 
a reasonable price. Small smoked herring are eaten un- 
cooked, and the other two kinds are excellent broiled, or 
parboiled and finished in the oven. Salt cod should not be 
despised, for it is convenient and may be made palatable. 
Like the meats, the fish preserved by these methods are 
slightly less available for digestion. 

Preserving in oil is made familiar to us by the sardine of 
Italy in olive oil and the small herring of America in cotton- 
seed oil, which also bears the name of sardine. The latter 
is less delicate in flavor than the European sardine, but is of 
course cheaper, and is palatable and of equal food value. 

Canned fish and shellfish are used in localities where fresh 
fish are not easily available, and should not be unwholesome 
if the process is properly inspected. Canned salmon is the 
most common, and makes an excellent luncheon dish when 
well prepared (see chapter on salads). 



242 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Principles of cooking. The protein in all of these is the 
chief consideration. The oyster is more delicate when cooked 
just below the boiling point of water for a brief period only. 
This is also true of the clam, except the tough membranes 
which must be chopped. The flesh of both lobster and 
clam is toughened by cooking, and the process should be 
short. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. All fish and shellfish should be thoroughly 
cleansed in cold water before using, and under running water when 
possible. Wash oysters, clams, and scallops in a colander or 
strainer under the faucet. If the oyster or clam liquor is used, 
put it through a fine strainer. 

1. To serve oysters and small clams raw. Arrange on finely 

chopped ice on a plate, with a piece of lemon in the center. 
Cut a section of lemon, not a slice. Horse-radish is sometimes 
served with the raw oyster. Garnish with parsley if you wish. 

2. Creamed oysters. Clean oysters of all pieces of shell. Cook 

them below the boiling point for a few minutes until plump 
and edges begin to curl. Drain and add to white sauce sea- 
soned with celery salt. Serve on toast, in bread cases, or patty 
shells. 

3. Sauted oysters. Clean one pint of oysters, sprinkle on both 

sides with salt and pepper. Lift by the tough muscle with 
a fork and dip on both sides in cracker crumbs and saute in 
butter until well browned on both sides. 

4. Clam chowder. 

Proportions. 

Clams 1 quart 

Potatoes 4 cups, cut in f inch dice 

Onion One, chopped 

Salt 1 tablespoonful 

Pepper I teaspoonful 

Butter 4 tablespoonfuls 

Milk 6 cups, scalded 
Soda Crackers 



FISH, SHELLFISH, AND MEAT SUBSTITUTES 243 

Clean and pick over clams, separate the hard and soft part 
of clams and chop the former. Strain clam liquor through 
cheesecloth. Try out the pork and fry the onion in it until 
brown and turn into a large kettle. Boil potatoes until tender, 
drain, and pour potatoes into kettle. Add clams, milk, butter, 
and crackers broken into small pieces. Let cook three minutes. 
Just before serving add clam liquor previously heated. Serve 
in bowls. 

5. To prepare lobster and crabs for serving. Make ready a large 
kettle of rapidly boiling water. Wrap a piece of paper around 
the lobster or crab, and plunge it head downward into the boil- 
ing water. Let the water boil gently for 20 minutes longer 
if the lobsters are very large. 

To open, a strong pair of scissors is the best utensil and some- 
times a hammer is necessary for the heavy claws. Pull out 
the flesh, keeping it as whole as possible. The stomach of the 
lobster and crab should be taken out and can be recognized 
near the head. The long intestine should also be removed 
and is easy to find in the hinderpart by splitting open this part 
and removing a long white string. The soft green portion 
is the liver and is eatable. 

To serve. (a) Pick apart and serve on lettuce with a 
French dressing, or (6) Serve hot with melted butter. 

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Among these, beans, peas, lentils, eggs, milk, and cheese 
have already been mentioned. Fish is classed also as a meat 
substitute. 

Nuts. These are a valuable meat substitute, some of 
them having a good protein content, and a high fat content 
as well. (See Fig. 66.) They may be served raw for dessert, 
with some fruit either fresh or dried, raisins and nuts being a 
pleasing combination. They should be thoroughly masti- 
cated. They are also palatable and possibly more digestible 
when cooked. The reason that many people consider nuts 
indigestible is because they eat them between meals, and do 
not give them a proper place in a meal, eating them when

enough food of other kinds has been taken. One who is 
open-minded in the matter of menus will find that nuts, raw 
or cooked, can literally take the place of meat in a meal. 

Almonds are always available in the markets and are so rich in 
protein and fat that a pound of shelled almonds is equivalent in 
food value to about three pounds of steak. At usual prices a good 
grade of almonds is more economical than the ordinary cuts of meat. 

Chestnuts are a staple food in parts of Italy, and have a delicious 
flavor in soups, stuffings, and sauces. Our own native chestnuts, 
boiled and served whole or roasted, make an excellent simple dessert. 

Hickory nuts, English walnuts, pecan nuts, and filberts are not 
only palatable in muffins, cake, and yeast bread, but add to the 
food value in a rational way. 

Peanuts are rich in oil and protein. They are nearly equal to 
almonds in food value and are even more economical. Peanuts 
are too concentrated a food for eating between meals or to be taken 
after a meal already sufficient, but they may take the place of meat in 
the meal and peanut butter may be used on bread and in sandwiches 
without butter. They, too, may be used with cake and cookies. 

Chopped nuts may be served with a variety of desserts. Remem- 
ber always that they are to be considered food.

may be directed to look up the composition, or the food value per ounce or per 
pound, of a variety of the foods of whatever group is under study and work 
out the return in food value for a given expenditure of money. The tables 
in Rose's "Laboratory Handbook for Dietetics" will be found especially 
useful in such work.

CHAPTER XV 
SALADS AND DESSERTS 

SALADS and desserts are sometimes looked upon as luxuries, 
and something to be omitted where people must exercise 
strict economy, and as more or less indigestible forms of food 
to be avoided. As a matter of fact both of these types of 
dishes are extremely valuable in giving variety to the diet. 
They may be very inexpensive, and when they have the 
right relation to the rest of the meal, are not more indigestible 
than many other forms of food. A heavy salad or rich dessert 
eaten after a sufficient amount of other food will naturally 
cause digestive disturbance. 

To disprove the theory of great cost of desserts, two 
friends once had an amusing contest to see which could serve 
the largest number of palatable desserts at the lowest price. 
It was interesting to see how many could be made for a cost 
of from six to ten cents for a family of five. 

Materials used for salad. The word " salad " is said to 
be derived from the Latin " salis " (salt) which implies that 
the salad has been looked upon more or less as a relish. We 
all associate with a salad appetizing crispness and freshness. 
The materials used in the modern salad are so varied that a 
complete list would include nearly all our fruits and vege- 
tables and meat foods. 

Green vegetables. Celery, chicory or endive, corn salad, cress, 
cucumber, dandelion, lettuce, onions, peppers, romaine or cos let- 
tuce, radishes, and tomatoes. 

247 



248 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cooked vegetables. Beans, string and whole, beets, cauliflower, 
carrots, potatoes, and spinach. 

Fruits uncooked. Any fresh fruit, possibly with the exception of 
some of the berries. 

Meat and poultry. The white meats like veal, chicken, and 
turkey are more attractive in salad, but any kind of cold meat may 
be used. 

Fish and shellfish. Lobsters, crabs, scallops, and cold fish. 

Nuts. Several kinds may be used in combination with fruit. 

Jellies. Tomato jelly, meat, chicken, and fish molded in 
jelly, may be served as a salad. 

Eggs. Hard-boiled eggs are used as a garnish. 

Cream cheese. May be served with lettuce. 

Salad dressings. Plain lettuce or celery served with salt 
is in a sense a salad, but it is our custom to dress the lettuce 
with a mixture which contains an acid and usually an oil. 
A very simple, old-fashioned form of dressing used in this 
country is vinegar and sugar. Substitute lemon juice or 
fresh lime juice for the vinegar and you will have a very 
refreshing and simple salad for a summer day. 

The ordinary dressing consists of vinegar or lemon juice, 
and oil; another form is mayonnaise, where the yolk and 
sometimes the white of egg are used to hold the oil and vine- 
gar together. 

Another form is a cooked dressing which may be bottled 
and kept for a longer time than the French dressing or the 
mayonnaise. 

Olitie oil. This is the most delicious oil for salad dressing when the 
flavor is liked and when it can be afforded. 

Cottonseed and corn oil. There are now in the market clarified 
cottonseed oil and corn oil that may be used in mayonnaise dress- 
ing, and the flavor is not unacceptable, and certainly superior 
to the poorer grades of olive oil which quite likely contain one of 
these oils as an adulterant. Cottonseed oil makes a better substi- 
tute for olive oil then does corn oil as it is at present refined. 



SALADS AND DESSERTS 



249 



Butter. Butter may be used in boiled salad dressing for those 
who dislike the flavor of the oils. 

The acids in dressing. These may be either vinegar or lemon juice, 
and many people with whom the vinegar disagrees can eat a salad 
made with lemon juice. The acid should not be used in excess 
in any case ; the best dressings do not give a distinctively acid 
taste. 

Adjuncts. Salt, mustard, cayenne pepper, paprika. 

GENERAL METHODS AND RECIPES 

General directions. The two important points in the prep- 
aration of the material for salad are, first, that everything should

be thoroughly dry, and, second, thoroughly chilled. The importance 
of these two points cannot be overemphasized, and they are of 
equal value in salad making. Many a salad is unpalatable because 
it is watery and wilted. For the preparation of green vegetables 
see Chapter VII. Vegetables should be cut in cubes or sometimes 
in slices. Meat, poultry, and shellfish should be cut in small pieces 
or chopped. The prepared meat should be mixed with some of 



250 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the oil and acid and allowed to stand in an ice box for some time 
before it is dressed and arranged for serving. This process is called 
marinating in the cookbooks, and gives a flavor to the salad that 
it cannot have if a dressing is poured over the meat just before 
serving. 

Combinations in salad. Several well-known combinations 
will at once occur to you. Meat salads usually have a mixture 
of celery. Several vegetables may be used together, as beans and 
carrots, or carrots, peas, and string beans with lettuce. Apples, 
nuts, and celery make a pleasing combination. Indeed there would 
seem to be no end to the possibilities here. 

Serving and garnishing. The principle here is to make the 
dish attractive with as little labor as possible. Everything served

as a garnish should be eatable. A bed of crisp dry lettuce leaves 
is the most attractive setting for any salad. When this is not 
procurable, cress makes an attractive border to a salad. Figure 
68 shows you a salmon jelly molded in a ring and attractively 
served in lettuce. Figure 67 shows a cucumber placed on lettuce 
leaves, dressed with a French dressing and sprinkled with chopped 
peppers. The cucumber is sliced ready to serve ; the slices being cut 
not entirely through the cucumber. This is rapidly prepared and

is most attractive. When the salad is arranged in its dish, it should 
be put in the ice box and allowed to remain until it is time to take 
it to the table. The salad is sometimes served on individual 
plates. 

1. French dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Salt \ teaspoonful 

Pepper \ teaspoonful . 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 4 tablespoonfuls 

Method. 

Mix the salt, pepper, and vinegar and stir in the olive oil 
slowly. A few drops of onion juice may be added. 

2. Mayonnaise dressing. 

Ingredients. ' 

Mustard 1 teaspoonful 

Salt 1 teaspoonful 

Powdered sugar 1 teaspoonful 
A few grains of cayenne 

Eggs Yolks of 2 

Lemon juice 2 tablespoonfuls 

Vinegar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Olive oil 1? cups 

Method. 

Stir together the eggs, mustard, salt, pepper, and sugar. 
Add the oil, a drop at a time, stirring and beating constantly. 
The back of a silver fork is a good thing for mixing mayonnaise, 
though some people prefer a Dover beater. As the dressing be- 
comes very thick it should be thinned occasionally with vinegar 
and lemon, alternately, but never let it lose its consistency. 
After the first, the oil may be added more rapidly. All ingre- 
dients and utensils must be cold. If the weather is warm, the 
bowl should be surrounded with ice water. If the dressing should 
separate, begin with another yolk of egg and stir the separated 
mixture into it slowly, as before. Set the bowl in a cold 
place and it should keep for many days.

3. Boiled dressing. 

Ingredients. 

Eggs 2 

Mustard I teaspoonful 

Salt tablespoonful 

Sugar tablespoonful 

Vinegar 3 tablespoonfuls 

Hot water cup 

Butter 1 tablespoonful

Method. 

Mix the dry ingredients and beat with the eggs until light. 
Add the vinegar and water and cook in a double boiler, stirring 
constantly until thick and smooth. Remove from the fire, stir 
in the butter and set away to cool. A little cream added after the 
dressing cools is a great addition. Sour cream may be used instead 
of the water, in which case less vinegar and butter should be used.

cubes. Marinate with French dressing. Just before serving 
moisten with mayonnaise or boiled salad dressing. Garnish 
with celery tips and olives. 

6. Waldorf salad. 

Ingredients. 

Apples, tart and juicy 

Celery, % as much as apples 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce leaves 
Method. 

Select tart, juicy apples. Cut in quarters, pare and core 
and cut in |-inch cubes. Add half as much celery, washed, 
scraped, and cut into cubes. Mix with boiled or mayonnaise 
dressing and serve cold on lettuce leaves. If handsome red 
apples can be had, they may be washed and polished and a 
slice cut from the stem end and the apple used as a cup after 
scooping out the inside to use for a filling with the celery. Serve 
on a lettuce leaf. Chopped nuts may be mixed with the apple 
and celery if desired. 

7. Stuffed tomato salad. 

Ingredients. 

Tomatoes, medium sized 

Boiling water 

Salt 

Cucumbers (or celery) 

Mayonnaise dressing 

Lettuce leaves 
Method. 

Cover medium sized tomatoes with boiling water for a min- 
ute and remove the skin. Cut a thin slice from the top and 
take out part of the seeds and pulp. Sprinkle inside of the 
tomato with salt, invert, and let stand one half hour. Fill 
tomatoes with cucumbers (or celery) cut in small cubes and 
moistened with mayonnaise dressing. Arrange on lettuce 
leaves and garnish top with mayonnaise dressing. 



Labor atory~management. \ egg yolk (1 teaspoonful) and | cup of olive 
oil is as small a quantity as is practicable to use in making the mayonnaise. 
This quantity made by groups of two works out well as the process of adding 
the oil drop by drop is difficult for a beginner working alone. The boiled 
dressing works in well as a variation of the boiled custard.

DESSERTS 

The dessert in this country includes the sweet dish, or the 
fruit at the end of the meal. In simple meals the dessert is 
usually one of the two, although in more elaborate meals 
fruit is served after the sweet dish, and sometimes crackers 
and cheese are served at the last. From the point of view 
of nutrition and digestibility this is more than is necessary, 
and you will notice that when both are served, the fruit is 
often declined. Like the salad, the dessert may be made 
from a large variety of materials and bears different names. 
There are hot puddings and cold puddings, pies and tarts, 
jellies and ices and ice creams. It is very interesting to read 
over the many dishes of this class in a cookbook and to attempt 
to classify them. If you are fortunate enough to have access 
to a cookbook of the eighteenth century, you will find 
that much labor was given to the preparation of elaborate 
structures which served as table ornaments ; even now you 
will find French cooks who spend much time in making 
elaborate displays of their skill. For everyday life the 
dessert should be attractive to the eye and yet simple. 
Materials used in desserts. 

Eggs, milk, and cream; these are important and are used in cus- 
tards, in dishes stiffened with gelatin or thickened with cornstarch, 
or in ice cream. 

Breadstuffs. Cake and sponge cake, bread crumbs and sliced 
bread, are valuable in desserts. Bread pudding may be made a 
very delicious dish. Bread may be combined with fruit in the shape 
of an escalloped dish. Baking powder biscuits, crust, and short- 
cake are also used. 

Other starchy substances. These are cornstarch, arrowroot, 
sago, tapioca and manioca. 

Fruits. Raw and cooked fruits of every possible kind. A few 
fruits like the lemon, orange, grapefruit, and melon are not cooked. 
For preparing fruit served alone, see Chapter VI.

Gelatin. This material has been mentioned in the chapter on 
meat. It is prepared for use in desserts in a number of forms, the 
granular being the most convenient. Gelatin has the property, 
first, of absorbing water, then of dissolving at the boiling tempera- 
ture of water and becoming stiff again when cool. After dissolving, 
as it is cooling and just as it begins to thicken slightly, it can be 
beaten like white of egg. If beating is attempted while the liquid is 
warm, or again if it becomes too stiff, the result is not successful. 
This property makes it useful in the sponges and other fancy 
desserts where the light spongy texture is desirable. 

Making desserts attractive. This is done by serving 
hot desserts in a dish around which a napkin may be folded ;

and cold desserts, especially those made with gelatin, may 
be molded in some attractive form and garnished. Figure 69 
shows a very simple gelatin dessert garnished with candied 
cherries and a little angelica, the stem of a plant which has 
been sugared, and the whole surrounded with whipped cream.

Whipping the cream and putting it around the base takes 
only a few minutes. As in salad, the garnish should be eat- 
able and easily prepared. 

1. Boiled custard. 

Ingredients. 

Milk 1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Eggs 3 

Vanilla | teaspoonful 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Method. 

Put the milk, sugar, and salt in a double boiler to scald. Sepa- 
rate the eggs and set the whites in a cold place until wanted. 
Beat the yolks until lemon-colored. Pour a little of the scalded 
milk on the yolks of the eggs, stirring until well mixed. Set the 
double'boilerbackon the stove and pour the egg and milk mixture 
slowly into the rest of the scalded milk, stirring constantly until 
thickened enough to coat the spoon. Remove from the fire, add 
the flavoring, and turn into a dish to cool. Just before serving 
beat the whites to a very stiff froth and pile by spoonfuls on the 
custard. The whites may be sweetened with powdered sugar 
after beating if desired. Corn starch may be used, and fewer eggs. 

2. Baked custard. 

Ingredients. 

Milk .1 pt. 

Sugar 2 tablespoonfuls 

Salt i teaspoonful 

Eggs 2 

Lemon or 

Vanilla | teaspoonful 

Method. 

Scald the milk, sugar, and salt together. Beat the eggs in a 
baking dish and pour the scalded milk over them. Add the 
flavoring and stir well. Set the baking dish in a pan of boil- 
ing water and bake in a moderate oven until a knife thrust into 
the custard will come out clean. Serve cold either plain, or with 
chocolate sauce. Nutmeg may be grated on top of the custard 
before baking, or caramel flavoring may be added in place of 
the vanilla.

knives. Stir in the milk and spread the mixture out on a but- 
tered layer cake tin. Bake in a hot oven until brown. Wash 
and hull a box of strawberries, sprinkle with | cup of sugar, and 
crush with a spoon. When the shortcake is done remove from 
the pan, cut around the edge with a sharp knife and right through 
the center of the cake, making two layers of it. Spread the lower 
layer with butter and then with the crushed strawberry. Replace 
the top layer and serve hot. Fresh peaches, preserves, or a 
mixture of orange and banana may be used for this shortcake.

Skin, wash, and chop the suet, and dredge with flour. Wash, 
pick over and seed the dried fruit, slice the citron if it is used, 
and dredge all with flour. Stir together the milk and molasses, 
sift the dry ingredients with the flour, and stir the liquid into 
the flour slowly. Add the suet, beating the mass thoroughly, 
and last the fruit, sprinkling in both the suet and the fruit as 
you stir. Fill a greased mold f full, close tightly, and cook in 
a kettle of boiling water for three hours. Serve with a hard 
or foamy sauce. 



Laboratory management. This can be made in class if each pupil will 
bring an empty baking powder or cocoa tin to school. A strip of greased 
cloth should be fastened around the edge of the cover. The recipe can be 
made in j cup proportions, and this amount can be cooked if the class 
period is two hours in length, but it is better to have the cooking finished 
at home. This is a seasonable exercise at Thanksgiving or Christmas. 



Brown Betty or apple scallop.

Minute tapioca needs no soaking. If pearl tapioca is used, 
it must be soaked one hour in cold water to cover. Pick over 
and wash the tapioca, drain off the water and add tapioca to 
the milk and salt scalded in the double boiler, and cook until 
the tapioca is transparent, or about | hour. Beat eggs and 
add the sugar to them. Combine mixtures by pouring a little 
of the hot mixture in the egg and then stirring this into the 
mixture remaining in the double boiler. Stir over fire until 
it becomes thick. Add the flavoring and pour into a dish to 
cool.

juice and strain into a mold and set away to harden. When it 
is stiff loosen from the sides of the mold (a cloth wrung out of 
hot water may be needed). Turn on to a plate and serve with 
whipped cream or soft custard. 

13. Snow pudding. 

Ingredients. 

Granulated gelatin 1 tablespoonful 
Cold water cup 

Boiling water 1 cup 

Sugar 1 cup 

Lemon juice \ cup 

Eggs Whites of 3 

Method. 

Mix as for lemon jelly. Set aside in a cool place, and as 
soon as it becomes sirupy stir occasionally until quite thick. 
Then beat with wire spoon or whisk until frothy. Fold in 
the beaten whites, and continue to beat lightly until quite 
stiff. Pile by spoonfuls on a plate and serve with boiled cus- 
tard, or mold as in Fig. 69. 

Frozen mixtures. There are some interesting principles 
to note here. The freezing is accomplished by using a mix- 
ture of chopped ice and rock salt. Can you explain how this 
reduces the temperature? 

Another interesting point is this : Have you ever seen a 
milk bottle on a cold winter morning with the paper cover or 
even the metal cap pushed up, the frozen milk standing high 
above the top of the bottle? What does this suggest to you 
in connection with the filling of the ice cream freezer? 

It must be noted, too, that a larger amount of flavoring 
material is needed in a frozen dessert than in one that is not. 
The frozen custard, for instance, needs more vanilla than one 
prepared in the ordinary manner. Can you account for this ? 

Method of freezing. 

There are many patterns of ice cream freezers that are well 
constructed and inexpensive. They are sold by the size, a 2 quart 



262 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

freezer giving you 2 quarts of the frozen cream. See that the crank 
is oiled and the whole apparatus clean. Have ready pounded ice 
and rock salt, usually in the proportion of 1 part salt to 3 of ice. 
Machines come for cutting the ice, but it is easy to pound it in a 
strong bag. Set the freezer can in place, put around it the ice and 
salt alternately, shaking down and packing firmly. Have the ice 
cream mixture cool, pour it in, having the can not more than f full. 
Put on the lid, cover with ice and salt, and begin to turn the 
crank. Open and stir down once or twice, being careful to keep 
out the salt. Take out the crank before the cream is too stiff. Pack 
the cream firmly down in the can. See that the melted water is 
removed from the pail, put in more ice and salt, and leave until the 
ice cream is firm.

are given under strawberry mousse.

CHAPTER XVI 
PREPARATION OF MEALS AND TABLE SERVICE 

THE preparation of a number of dishes assembled for a 
meal requires a skill quite different from that necessary for 
the making of a single dish. A menu being decided upon, 
it needs an accurate sense of time, forethought, and prompt- 
ness, to have a number of dishes ready at the same time, or 
in proper sequence if several courses are served. Such 
questions as the following must be answered : 

Technique of preparation. 

1. What steps in preparation can be taken ahead of time, as 
washing, paring, cutting, etc. ? 

2. What dishes take the longest to cook ? 

3. Which must be served the moment they are done? 

4. Which can be kept hot for some time without injury ? 

5. Which can be finished and cooled perhaps several hours 
before ? 

6. Do the dishes selected require the same utensils at the same 
time? (If so, the menus must be changed.) 

7. What is the order of serving? 

To understand the bearing of these questions you will need 
to select some menu and make a plan for preparing it. (See 
exercises at the end of this chapter.) 

The fact is obvious that in preparing a meal you cannot 
finish the dishes one at a time, but that steps individual to 
each dish must be interwoven with each other, and the cook 
must have them all " on her mind/' and is often doing half 
a dozen things at once. As a high school girl, preparing a 

265 



266 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

part of her first meal, remarked, " This is as good training as 
mathematics." 

The woman at home will devise many ways of easing and 
shortening the labor just before the meal is served, avoiding 
haste and anxiety in this way. With the fireless cooker and 
other slow-cooking apparatus, the heavy work may sometimes 
be done far ahead of mealtime. A dessert can be prepared 
and be cooking as breakfast dishes are washed, and at the 
time left overs are put away they can be arranged ready for 
serving, as in the case of poultry or meat to be served cold. 
While the preparation of the midday meal is in progress, 
something can sometimes be done for the last meal, too. 
This, indeed, is a field for generalship, and it is a successful 
campaign when the meals are all on time and well prepared, 
and the cook and family cheerful. 

Important points in serving each dish. Each dish should 
be perfectly done, neither over nor under cooked. All hot 
dishes should be hot, and cold dishes cold. Lukewarm food 
is not agreeable. Bread and cake and some kinds of pastry 
are the only foods that may have the temperature of the 
room. Sliced meat and salads should be cold. Chill choc- 
olate eclairs before serving and see how much they are im- 
proved ; indeed, experiment with a number of foods that are 
usually served at room temperature. 

To keep food hot. A hot closet above a coal or gas range is 
made for this purpose, and steam heaters sometimes have hot 
closets. A double boiler is a help, and one utensil may be set into 
a larger, filled with boiling water. Some dishes can be set back on 
the stove, or over a simmering gas burner with an asbestos mat 
underneath. The oven may be used sometimes, with the door set 
ajar. The food may be kept covered unless it will steam, in 
which case cover it with a towel. Serve food in hot dishes. 

To keep food cool. Leave the dish in the ice box until the last 
possible moment. Sometimes serve with iee (butter in warm 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 267 

weather). If ice is lacking, use other cooling devices. Serve in 
chilled dishes. 

Garnishing the dish. All food must be neatly placed in the 
dish, and arranged or piled with some sort of symmetry, and this is 
the most that some people have time to do. Many foods may be 
served in the utensil or dish in which they are cooked, and in the 
case of a baking dish, if its appearance is not neat, a napkin can 
be folded about it. The simplest form of garnish is browning on 
the top, which makes many dishes attractive (mashed potato). 

Make the garnishing simple, and have it eatable when possible. 
Slices of hard boiled eggs on spinach, chopped parsley and butter 
on boiled or mashed potato, parsley and slices of lemon, with meat 
and fish. 

Vegetable borders are attractive and save labor in dish washing. 
Arrange the meat in the center of the platter, and pile mashed po- 
tato, or boiled rice or peas or beans, or a mixture of hot vegetables 
around the edge. This saves time in table service, too. 

The garnishing of salads, desserts, and cakes is treated in pre- 
vious chapters. 

Table equipment and service. This is a place where 
beauty is a large element, and most people understand the 
charm of a daintily laid table, as the family gathers for a 
meal. But many factors must be taken into account, for 
it is an easy matter to pass from the simple and beautiful 
to an extravagant display, to spend more on the dining-room 
equipment than the income warrants, and to waste much 
energy in unnecessary work. Our great need here is to learn 
to see beauty in simplicity. We must remember, too, that 
many people in our country live in crowded quarters, and have 
no time for anything but the simplest kind of table service. 1 

The table should be firm, large enough to accommodate the family 
comfortably, and it should permit of extension when occasion de- 
mands a larger board. The top should have an oil finish that will 
not easily mar and that can be washed off. Have a thick cloth or 
pad to protect it the "silence cloth." 

1 For Furnishing the Dining Room, see "Shelter and Clothing," p. 88. 



268 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Table covers may be the small doilies with centerpiece, strips 
of fine linen crash, or blue or brown and white Japanese toweling 
laid across both ways, a cloth that just covers the table, or a large 
cloth that hangs well below the table edge. The doilies and strips 
are used conventionally for breakfast and dinner, but save much 
labor when used for all meals. The color may be white, or tinted, 
but the dark-colored cloth should be banished. 

The material may be linen or mercerized cotton. Many people 
think white table oilcloth is impossible, but a table covered with 
it may be made very pretty ; it can be kept clean by washing at 
the end of each meal, and the saving in labor is incalculable. 

The pattern and quality and cost of table linens are mentioned 
in Chapter XXI. 

Napkins may match the tablecloths. A small size economizes 
labor. Avoid fringes, selecting a scalloped edge or hemstitch. 
Japanese paper napkins are useful in summer, and for box luncheons. 

The dishes. Only a few practical suggestions can be given here. 
This is a topic for the art class. 

Buy from "open stock." This means, not a single set, but a 
pattern that the manufacturer and retailer have always on hand, so 
that the purchaser can buy one plate or cup and saucer, to replace 
breakage. 

An elaborate or highly colored design becomes wearisome, is 
not practical for those who have a limited supply of dishes, and is 
in questionable taste. A positive color demands always the same 
general scheme for other decorations. A band of color, or a narrow 
design at the edge, of a color harmonizing easily with other colors, 
is in good taste. Gold and green are safe colors. See Fig. 72. 
White dishes with a raised border are dainty, and any color scheme 
may be used with them. See Fig. 71. 

The number of dishes depends upon the simplicity or elaborate- 
ness of the method of living and the size of the family. It is much 
better to begin with a few, and increase the number when neces- 
sary, than to have the shelves filled with unused ware. (See 
exercises.) 

Glassware is pressed or cut, the latter being beautiful, but an 
expensive luxury. Glasses for water, and dishes for berries, are made 
with simple and attractive designs in the pressed ware, and serve 
all ordinary purposes. A pretty shape for the glass for water is 
shown in Fig. 71. 



PREPARATION OF MEALS

270 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Silver and plated silver for knives, forks, and spoons, coffee and 
tea sets, all add to the charm of the table. A large collection is 
not necessary for everyday use, and it adds greatly to the labor of 
the housewife. Figure 70 shows some good designs in spoons, 
and spoons and forks of different sizes come in the same design. A 
simple design is easy to clean. Three sizes of spoons, tablespoons, 
teaspoons, and coffee spoons, and two sizes of forks are all suffi- 
cient, with a few larger spoons for service and desserts. 

Triple-plated ware lasts for years, if well cared for, and comes 
in good designs. 

Pewter, familiar in olden days, is being used again in Colonial 
designs, and makes an attractive tea or coffee set, is less costly 
than solid silver, and has a better tone and color than plated ware. 

Cutlery. Plated knives are easy to care for, but steel knives 
are more effective for some purposes. Purchase good quality steel 
knives, especially in the carving set. 

Setting the table. The first principles here are to have 
everything clean and shining, and to lay everything straight. 
Have as little on the table as possible. It is not comfortable 
to have a large array of articles at one's place. Figure 71 
shows you a dainty and well-laid table, arranged for a Sunday 
night supper, and this arrangement is a good one for any 
meal, with substitutes for the chafing dish. 

Be sure that the cloth is straight, the center fold in the middle of 
the table, and that the cloth hangs evenly on all sides. See that 
centerpiece and doilies are laid at even distance. . 

Laying each place. In Fig. 71 the knife, edge out, is at the right, 
with one spoon, and the glass is at the right, in line with the end of 
the knife. Two forks are at the left, and a plate for bread and but- 
ter, with bread knife are at the left, opposite the glass. The napkin 
is at the left. This plan, somewhat elaborated, may be safely fol- 
lowed for formal service. Two knives may be placed at the right, 
with the soup spoon, and three forks at the left. If more than 
these are needed, they may be supplied later, laid on the plate placed 
for a certain course, in the middle of the plate, handle toward the 
guest.

272 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

The other articles on the table may vary widely. For every- 
day use, where there is no maid, or only one, set in places convenient 
to pass, the salt and pepper, vinegar and sugar, bread plate and 
butter plate, and any small dish of condiment or pickle, with pretty 
mats for the hot dishes to be set on later, and enough spoons for 
serving. See that the arrangement is symmetrical and convenient. 
A table laid in this way has room for little more in the way of 
" decoration " than a slender vase holding a few flowers in the center. 
The dishes for dessert can be ready on a side table. 

For formal service nothing is placed on the table in addition 
to the equipment at each place, but some centerpiece containing 
ferns or flowers, with pretty dishes of silver or glass holding relishes, 
candies, or dried fruits, a graceful arrangement being to alternate 
four of these with four candlesticks for meals served late in the 
day. 

Table decorations. Here fancy may run riot with color schemes, 
and pretty devices for special occasions. A painted place card, a 
small bonbon box, a single flower with a pin for fastening it on, 
all these have their place at times. Satin ribbon is not an appropriate 
table decoration laid across the table in a broad band, even when it 
displays a class color. Find some other way to make the color 
effective. A color scheme in the food can be carried out to a degree 
for some occasion, but do not let the color interfere with a really 
satisfactory menu. 

Relishes have already been suggested as decoration radishes 
cut in rose shape, olives, candies, and fruit. 

The tray for invalid and convalescent. Figures 72 and 73 suggest 
the daintiness possible in setting a tray. It is well worth while to 
spend time in the careful arrangement of the tray, for pretty dishes 
in orderly array may tempt the appetite of the invalid. 

Waiting on the table. When we wait on ourselves, this 
should be done with cheerfulness, and all should take a share. 
After the food is on the table, one person can " help " one 
thing and one another. It is a good plan for the young people 
of the family to take turns as waiter in removing the soiled 
dishes and food and putting on the dessert. A quick method 
is to place a tray on a small stand near the table, taking the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



273 




274 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

dishes from one place at a time, and sorting them on the tray 
as you go. The tray can then be carried into the kitchen, 
with the dishes partly arranged for washing. 

One mother uses a plan for having everybody help at 
breakfast time, modeled after the tray system of a cafeteria. 
The breakfast is cooked ready to serve, and on the kitchen 
table is a small tray for each one of the family of four. All 
necessary articles are at hand, and even the boy of seven sets 
his own tray and helps himself to food, and takes his place 
at the table; and then when the meal is ended each one 
carries out his dishes and puts them in neat array for washing. 

The waitress at a formal meal has to be alert, rapid yet 
gentle in all her motions, with a desire to make other 
people comfortable, and a faculty for remembering their 
likes and dislikes. A good waitress does not pass a second 
time a dish once declined. 

The waitress must know the menu, and have everything 
ready for each course at hand on the sideboard, with dishes 
kept hot in the hot closet. 

The table is laid in time, she herself is immaculate, and the 
room is well aired and the temperature agreeable. A piece 
of bread is folded in each napkin. If the first course is cold, 
perhaps a grapefruit, she arranges these at each place. 
If it is to be a hot bouillon, the cook tells her that all is ready, 
and then she informs the hostess that dinner or luncheon is 
served. 

The details of this type of waiting vary with the place and 
the taste of the hostess, but the following method is simple 
and rapid. 

Serving. Serve everything from the side table. Hold the 
dish to be served firmly in two hands with a napkin underneath, 
a tablespoon and fork being placed on the dish. Pass to the left 
of the guest, and hold the dish at a convenient height and near the 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 



275 




276 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

plate. After all the dishes in a course are passed in this way, watch 
to see if second helps are needed. 

Remove the soiled plates at the left, and place the clean at the 
left, removing with the left hand and placing with the right. 

Fill glasses at the right, and remove silver at the right before 
dessert when there are pieces left unused. 

Brush crumbs with a soft, folded napkin upon a plate, at the 
left, just before dessert when everything is taken from the table 
but the center decoration, the candies, and the glass of water. 
With' this plan the guest helps himself each time, even the after 
dinner coffee being passed on a tray with cream and sugar, and he 
can take as little as he pleases, or decline. Some hostesses have some 
of the courses arranged on individual plates and placed, and these 
may be placed either from the left or right. But the other method 
is simple and satisfactory. 

/ The finger bowls may be set on plates of dessert size with a 
doily underneath. If a spoon or fork is needed with the dessert, 
one or both may be placed on the plate also, one on each side, if both 
are used. The bowls should be less than half full of water and the 
water should be a comfortable temperature, neither cold nor notice- 
ably warm. Set the plates arranged in this way before each guest. 
The guest himself will remove the bowl and doily and silver before 
the dessert is passed. In large banquets the food must be placed 
on the individual plate. 

The question is sometimes asked, " Who shall be served first? " 
It is a good plan to change this from course to course, begin- 
ning the first time with the guest of honor. It is not a matter of 
great importance, provided no one has to wait long. Two waitresses 
make the service quicker. 

The guests of honor sit at the right of the host and hostess. 

The number of courses. Two or three courses are enough for 
everyday comfort and health. In formal serving, it is good taste 
not to have too many. A first course of grapefruit or perhaps 
oyster cocktail, a soup, a fish course, or some light substitute for it, 
the main course with meat, a salad, dessert, coffee make a quite 
sufficient meal. The " entree " is a light dish, say sweetbreads in 
cases, after the fish course, but it is quite unnecessary. Many 
people are becoming very weary of the long-drawn-out dinners and 
banquets, which are certainly far from hygienic. 



PREPARATION OF MEALS 277 

Carving. This is an art that used to be taught as an 
accomplishment to girls, and it is not an easy matter to master. 

If not done at the table, it must nevertheless be well done. 
Watch a good carver, and practice when you have a chance. A few 
simple directions can be given, but a demonstration is really neces- 
sary. First and foremost, have a sharp, strong knife, and a strong 
fork. The next essential is a platter large enough to hold the meat, 
without having it slip off. The fork must be firmly placed in the 
meat, and the meat held down.. Notice the shape of the cut of 
meat. Meat must be cut across the grain. Loosen from the bone, 
notice the grain, and cut evenly and firmly. With fowl, discover 
the joints, pierce with the end of the knife, disjoint, and lay at the 
side, and then slice the breast across the grain. If carving at the 
table, learn the preference of those served, whether they wish light 
or dark meat, meat well done or underdone. Have a spoon for 
dish gravy and stuffing.

CHAPTER XVII 

THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD ' 

THIS is at all times an important matter, but the notable 
increase in food prices, during the last decade, has made it a 
matter of interest to all. The cost of food is one item only 
in the whole cost of living, and this is affected by many con- 
ditions in manufacture and commerce and the business of 
the nations. Economists and others interested in social 
questions are studying the problem, but as yet they do not 
agree upon the cause, or causes, of the increased cost of living. 
We cannot hope, therefore, to understand the situation fully ; 
but we must be determined to spend money as wisely as we 
can, and to learn what we may about food prices in relation to 
food values. There are a few causes of the difference in price 
between one food and another that are more or less unchang- 
ing. The cost of food may be considered from several points 
of view. The question of the cost for each individual a day 
and relation of cost and nutritive value are studied in Chapter 
XVIII. The proportion of the income to be spent for food 
is taken up in Chapter XIX. 

Labor and prices. The amount of labor involved in 
producing a food material affects its price. Meats cost 
more than staple vegetable foods, like corn, wheat, or beans, 
because we must raise the corn first to feed the animals. 
Meat is as cheap as vegetable foods only when the animal 
can find its own food, as in the pioneer days of any country, 
when only a small part of the land is under cultivation. To 
the Pilgrim Fathers, meat was cheaper than corn, in terms of 

278 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 279 

labor, with deer at hand in the forest and corn raised with 
difficulty in small clearings. Meat production is now an 
industry, and the product an expensive one, especially as the 
wide cattle ranges of our West, where the animals have for- 
merly found natural food, are now used more and more for 
other purposes. 

Transportation. Carrying food from place to place in- 
creases its cost. In one sense this is another form of labor. 
Each person who handles the food material from producer 
to consumer adds something to what the consumer pays. 
We have heard much discussion of late of the " middleman," 
and the effort to bring the producer and consumer closer 
together. This simply means doing away with some person 
who handles the product after it leaves the producer and 
before it reaches the consumer and who must have something 
for his labor. In transportation there is another element in- 
volved, the original cost of the means of conveyance ; and the 
natural wear and tear on the product are items that increase 
the final cost. The modern farmer who carries his produce 
to market in an auto truck must have a return for the original 
cost of the truck and the keeping of it in repair. The long- 
distance railway furnishes cold-storage cars, and the cost' of 
these and their maintenance affect freight rates. A peach 
from South Africa costs from fifty to sixty cents in the Boston 
market. It is probably true, in this case, that a fancy price 
is asked because African fruit is a novelty here ; but the diffi- 
culty and expense of long-distance transportation naturally 
make it costly. 

Demand and supply. The relation of demand to supply 
affects the price of food in a way not difficult to understand. 
Where the supply is permanently small and the demand 
widespread, the price of the particular food material will be 
high, and vice versa. Olive oil is a good example of the per- 



280 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

manently high-priced food. California olive oil brings a high 
price not only because it is pure and well flavored, but be- 
cause many people want it, and the industry is a small one. 
Many years are needed to establish an olive grove, and olive 
raising is not a popular way of making money, because it is 
slow. One enterprising American firm has bought an olive 
grove in Spain, and is using new methods there, but the prod- 
uct, though delicious, is no cheaper. Although the manu- 
facture of olive oil will doubtless remain a rather, small in- 
dustry, the use of olive oil is increasing, in this country, at 
least. It does not seem likely, therefore, to become a cheap 
form of fat. 

We find nearly the opposite of this in cottonseed oil, a 
large supply and a relatively smaller demand making a low 
price. The seed (a by-product of the cotton industry) con- 
tains a large quantity of oil, and it is not all used as food. 
Therefore, it is permanently a low-priced fat, as contrasted 
with the permanently high-priced fat, olive oil. 

Agricultural conditions. There are two things of which 
the farmer can never feel sure, the kind of weather to expect 
and the general character of the season. Of course, the 
sea'son affects the quality and the amount of any crop, and 
this, again, influences the price. 

Another aspect of the effect of season on food is this : that 
a food is in its own locality cheaper when it is in season than at 
other times of year, when it has to be brought from a distance. 

Insect pests and plant diseases not infrequently spoil a 
crop, and the market price goes up with the smaller supply. 
This is what happened not long since to the potato crop and 
potato prices, when potatoes were affected by the potato 
blight. Moreover, if the farmer succeeds in keeping his 
crop free from a particular pest, it means a more or less per- 
manent increase in his expenses, for in fighting insects and 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 281 

fungi there is an outlay for machinery and chemicals, and 
much labor is expended. Unfortunately, injurious insects 
and plant diseases are on the increase, and this may mean a 
permanent rise in the cost of certain foods. Another fact 
has to be reckoned with in comparing the prices of different 
foods. Some vegetables are more difficult to raise than 
others, even when the season is favorable, and the insects 
at least partly conquered. Some plants have more vitality 
than others, and grow under almost any condition of soil and 
moisture. 

Animal diseases must also affect the price of food. If a 
large number of cattle are found .to have tuberculosis, and 
are condemned as food, healthy cattle bring a higher price, 
because, again, the supply is small in relation to the demand. 

Quality of food. Poor food always costs less money than 
good food, but it may not be economy to buy it. There 
may be more usable material in one good apple at five cents 
than in three wormy ones for five. 

Form and place in which food is sold. Food in the 
package costs more than in bulk, and each fancy label adds a 
fraction to the cost. Plate-glass windows and ribbon decora- 
tions in a shop and the large expense of rent on a fashionable 
street are all paid for by the consumer. 

Relative cost of home and shop products. When pre- 
pared food of any kind is purchased, one pays for raw mate- 
rial plus the cost of fuel and the labor involved in the cooking 
and the cleaning of apparatus and .kitchen. For example, 
canned soup sold by one of the best manufacturers brings 
a good price because so much time and labor are used in a 
careful inspection of all material, and in keeping up a high 
standard of cleanliness. Remember, too, that whenever 
cooked food appears on the table, these two items, fuel and 
labor, are in reality added to the cost of the raw material. 



282 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

We may not pay cash always for the labor, but it must be 
accounted for in time and energy. The woman who says, 
" My time doesn't count," has a poor opinion of herself. 
Whether or not it is better to buy cooked food or to prepare 
food at home is discussed on page 292. 

Other elements in food prices. So far we have considered 
those causes of food prices that are what may be called 
" natural," always to be taken into account, and only partly 
under our control. There are others that have to do with 
big business methods and interests and that have great in- 
fluence at some one period in a nation's life, and less at others. 
They are more or less under our control if we have the wis- 
dom and courage to act. A discussion of these causes is 
part of the study of economics proper, and we can only stop 
by the way to think of them for a moment. 

Transportation must always increase cost, as we have 
learned, but bad methods, involving the handling of food by 
many people, increase it unnecessarily. Our present methods 
of marketing food are clumsy, and not economical, especially 
in large cities. The subject is being seriously studied with a 
view to improvement, possibly by the establishment of public 
markets. 

At present we have a bewildering state of things, but the 
housekeeper who sincerely desires, can learn to buy and pre- 
pare the less costly foods in an appetizing way, and leave 
nothing for the garbage pail but the parts that are actually 
not eatable. 

Comparative costs. It would be useless to print here a 
list of actual prices, since they vary in different localities, 
and are constantly changing. This list can be made by 
yourselves in your notebooks for your own home town, and 
for the current year. The table on page 317 is a guide, how- 
ever, for in spite of fluctuations in prices there are certain 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 



283 



foods that are permanently more economical than others; 
for example, grain products than meats, for reasons already 
explained. As a rule, the rising cost of food has been so 
general as not to change greatly the relative economy of the 
different types of food as compared with each other. 

Cost and nutritive value. The discussion of cost has 
dealt so far with the cost of food materials as they are found 
in the market. What we are really seeking to learn is the 
amount of nutritive material to be obtained for a given sum 
of money, and in order to do this, we must think of our pur- 
chases in terms of the foodstuffs and their values. The 
accompanying table from a government bulletin 1 gives an 
estimate of cost from this point of view in terms of protein 
and fuel value. Notice that wheat bread is a cheap food, 
standing first in the amount of building material and energy.

The price quoted for eggs is low, and even less could be ob- 
tained for ten cents at prevailing prices in 1913-1914. This 
kind of estimate is a help in making menus and dietaries. 
(See Chapter XVIII.) Another method of estimating econ- 
omy for this purpose is by calculating the cost of 100-Calorie 
portions of various food materials. A table giving such a 
comparison will be found in the next chapter. 

PURCHASING FOOD 

In addition to the general principles of buying discussed 
in Chapter XXI there are some details to be studied in 
purchasing food. 

Personal attention in buying food. It is absolutely 
necessary to visit the market and the grocery where food is 
purchased. The purchaser would not fail to visit a shop 
before deciding to patronize it regularly, but frequent calls 
are necessary if buying is to be economical. Select the 
grocery, market, and bakery with a view to their cleanliness. 
Notice if the doors and windows are screened, and if proper 
effort is made to catch flies that may have entered. Refuse 
to buy food that is exposed upon the sidewalk, and if it is 
within doors, see that it is protected from dust and flies. 
The best markets now have tiled walls and floors, which help 
to insure cleanliness. The difference in odor is marked be- 
tween a market that is properly cleaned daily, and one where 
the proprietor uses uncleanly methods. Meat and vege- 
tables, in particular, should be personally selected whenever 
this is possible. The butcher must understand that the pur- 
chaser is familiar with the different cuts of meat and that 
honest service is demanded in regard to the quality, trimming, 
and weight of the meat. One does not want to be too sus- 
picious, but it is well for the butcher to know that the pur- 
chaser has a set of standard scales at home by which to prove 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 285 

the accuracy of his weighing. It is also important to inspect 
fruit and vegetables for quality and cost. 

Quantities in which to purchase food. The amount that 
one purchases of a certain food depends on its keeping quali- 
ties, and upon the storage space available at home. A gen- 
eral rule may be stated : Buy perishable foods in small 
quantities; non-perishable foods in large. The reason for 
buying in larger quantity is that the cost is somewhat less, 
although sometimes it seems but little less. Some one has 
remarked that no one is a good buyer who does not consider 
a quarter of a cent. In a modern house or apartment where 
there is not room for a barrel of flour or sugar, then the 
quantity must be gauged by the space. The same is true of 
canned goods as of flour and sugar. Buying by the dozen 
saves a little on each can if you have shelf room for piling the 
cans. 

Foods may be classed in this connection as perishable, 
semi-perishable, and non-perishable. This depends some- 
what for any one housekeeper upon the size of her refrigera- 
tor, and upon an available place where food may be cool, 
even if not so cold as in the refrigerator. Those foods 
classed here as perishable are those which readily " spoil," 
that is, those that are affected by mold and bacteria on ac- 
count of the moisture that they contain, and also those that 
lose flavor and freshness quickly. Those most easily affected 
should be kept the coldest; those in the semi-perishable 
group do not deteriorate so rapidly, although a low tem- 
perature is desirable with all of these. Under the non-perish- 
able foods are classed those that are not subject to bacteria 
or mold in ordinary circumstances. These should be kept 
dry, however, and never in a heated place. In a sense, no 
food material is non-perishable. Insects sometimes develop 
in the cereal products, for instance, and the material is thus 



286 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

rendered unfit for food. The food adjuncts do not spoil 
except as they lose flavor if kept too long. 

Perishable. Milk, cream, uncooked meat, uncooked fish, shell- 
fish, berries, fruits with delicate skins, lettuce, and vegetables that 
wilt easily. 

Semi-perishable. Butter, eggs, cooked meat and fish, root 
vegetables, cooked vegetables, left overs in general, skin fruits like 
apples, bananas, oranges, and lemons, dried fruits, scalded milk 
and cream, smoked and salted fish and meats, open molasses and 
sirup. 

Non-perishable. Flour, meals and cereals, sugar, salt, and other 
condiments and flavorings, jellies, preserves and canned goods, 
coffee, tea, cocoa, and chocolate. 

Suggestions for buying. Milk and cream must be de- 
livered daily. The average amount used by the family is 
the regular order. Fresh meat should be delivered on the 
day wanted unless the refrigerator is large with a space for 
hanging meat. Even then, it should not be kept more than 
twenty-four hours. Meat should not be placed directly on 
the ice. Fresh berries and delicate vegetables should be 
delivered on the day wanted. Butter and eggs may be pur- 
chased once a week; other semi-perishables in quantities 
depending on storage space. It is economical to buy a box 
of lemons, and the root vegetables in large quantities. Flour 
and sugar are purchased by the bag or barrel ; lump sugar, 
in boxes. Breakfast cereals are best bought in packages, 
and it is wise not to buy a large number at one time. 
It is better to purchase oftener and have fresher material. 
Coffee may be bought in pound cans, but it is economy to 
purchase it in five or ten pound quantities, unground. Tea 
comes in closely sealed packages, in J, J, and 1 Ib. and 
larger. Cocoa is bought in J Ib. cans, but it is economy 
to buy in large cans if it is frequently used. Macaroni is 
bought by the package, and the number at one time must 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 287 

depend on how much it is used in the menu. Rice, tapioca, 
and sago may be bought in bulk and kept in tin or glass jars. 
Salt by the bag or box. Spices, ground, hi tight boxes; 
whole hi bulk, to be kept in tightly closed cans. Molasses 
comes by the gallon or in cans. If hi bulk, it is usually acid ; 
in the can it is not. Vinegar comes by the gallon, or hi 
bottles. Canned and preserved goods, singly, by the dozen, 
or case. Bakery products, when bought at all, should be 
purchased daily, or every other day. Do not buy so much 
that stale bread accumulates. 

Weights, measures, and packages. The buyer is at a 
disadvantage here in regard to quantities, for the baskets hi 
which fruits and vegetables are sold do not always conform 
to the standard dry measures, and dishonest dealers evade 
the law in regard to the use of standard scales. Even if 
they have the standard, they resort to tricks that give the 
customer short weights. Here the Bureau of Weights and 
Measures, with its Commissioner and corps of inspectors, 
comes to the aid of the purchaser. Effective work has been 
done hi our cities in enforcing the laws, and this work con- 
tinues. 

Selling fruit, vegetables, and even eggs by weight would 
simplify matters in many ways, and this is the custom in 
some parts of the United States with vegetables and fruit, 
although it is not yet a common practice ; with eggs it seems 
more convenient to sell by the dozen, but grading according 
to size is a step toward standardization. 

The alluring packages in which so many articles are offered 
are quite uneven as to the quantities they contain. They 
certainly do away with some handling of food, and they keep 
out dust. Unfortunately, an attractive package does not 
guarantee a clean factory or clean handling hi the packing. 
Dried figs, for example, in pretty baskets are sometimes 



288 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

packed in uncleanly places. Moreover, small packages are 
poor economy, since the box adds to the cost of the food 
material, and sometimes there seems even more package than 
food. If the family consumes many biscuits or " crackers," 
it costs considerably more to buy them in packages. Yet, 
these are convenient, and should be cleanly, and are justi- 
fied for these reasons, provided the housekeeper does not buy 
many small packages. 

The quantities in canned goods are variable and sometimes 
below measure when purchased from a second-rate dealer. 
In September, 1914, the net weight amendment to the 
National Food Law will go into effect, after which, in general, 
foods sold in packages must be labeled to show net weight 
or measure or numerical count. 

As already suggested, you should own standard scales for 
testing the purchases made by weight, even baker's bread. 
Buy fruit and vegetables by the quart, peck, and bushel, 
rather than by the basket of uncertain measure. Examine 
baskets containing small fruits to see if they have false 
bottoms. If you discover small measure, report at once to 
the dealer, and to whatever authority has charge of such 
matters in your town. 

Quality. Modern methods of manufacture, transporta- 
tion, and storage make it difficult to determine the history 
and quality of food we purchase in the markets. Yet the 
consumer has a natural right to know if the food offered for 
sale is the best of its kind ; fresh eggs, clean milk, meat from 
healthy animals, untainted and free from harmful preserva- 
tives, sound vegetables and fruit, manufactured and pre- 
served foodstuffs unspoiled by the manufacturing processes, 
free from harmful preservatives, and of good flavor. Many 
people must be in danger of forgetting the flavor of a fresh- 
laid egg. The familiar signs in many small shops, " Fresh 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 289 

eggs/' " Strictly fresh eggs," " Fancy eggs," are amusing, 
but they bespeak an unnatural state of things. 

As our business methods have created conditions beyond 
the control of the individual consumer it follows that we must 
take concerted action, and make and enforce whatever laws 
are necessary. This is done partly through the Federal 
government, and partly through state laws and municipal 
ordinances. Thus, while we may not know the actual con- 
ditions in which food is produced, we may through legislation 
seek to insure that the food we buy shall be 

(1) what it purports to be in kind and amount, 

(2) free from deterioration or unwholesome conditions, 

(3) possessed of full nutritive value. 

The Federal Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, com- 
monly known as " The Pure Food Law," and on which sub- 
sequent legislation by most of the states has been .largely 
based, defines the main types of adulteration and misbrand- 
ing, but, except in the case of confectionery and of habit- 
forming drugs, does not name the specific substances which 
are to be prohibited or restricted in use, nor does the law 
itself contain standards of composition for foods. 

According to this law a food is deemed adulterated : 

(1) If any substance has been mixed or packed with it. so 
as to reduce or lower or injuriously affect its quality or 
strength. 

(2) If any substance has been substituted, wholly or in part. 

(3) If any valuable constituent has been wholly or in part 
abstracted. 

(4) If it be mixed, colored, coated, powdered, or stained 
in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed. 

(5) If it contain any added poisonous or other added 
deleterious ingredient which may render such article in- 
jurious to health. 



290 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT

posed, or putrid animal or vegetable substance, or any por- 
tion of an animal unfit for food, or if it be the product of a 
diseased animal, or one that has died otherwise than by 
slaughter. 

And a food is deemed to be misbranded : 

(1) If it be an imitation of or offered for sale under the 
distinctive name of another article. 

(2) If it be labeled or branded so as to deceive or mislead 
the purchaser, or purport to be a foreign product when not 
so, or if the contents shall have been substituted in whole or 
in part, or if it fail to bear a statement on the label of the 
quantity or proportion of any narcotic or habit-forming 
drug which it contains. 

(3) If it bear an incorrect statement of weight or 
measure. 

(4) If the package containing it or its label shall bear any 
statement, design, or device which is false or misleading in 
any particular. 

For a fuller discussion of the basis of pure food legislation 
and the essential features of the United States laws see Sher- 
man's " Food Products/' from which a part of the summary 
here given is drawn. 

The modern cold storage plant is of immense service in 
keeping food from the season of abundance to that of scar- 
city, but it may prove worse than useless if improperly 
managed. State and federal laws must control the manage- 
ment, and government inspection must be thorough. Cold 
storage would be a benefit to all under proper conditions of 
management, and the prices of many foods would be evenly 
adjusted by the maintenance of a steady supply. Many 
states now have laws regulating cold storage plants and 
there is every reason to hope that the abuses which have 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 291 

sometimes existed will be eliminated and the usefulness of 
cold storage extended. 

We may feel that the progress of the pure food movement 
has been most satisfactory, even though much more remains 
to be done. The states generally have either enacted new 
food laws, or revised their laws following the national law. 
Under the national law over 2000 prosecutions have already 
(1913) been decided in favor of the government. 

Congress has passed an even more stringent law for meat 
inspection supplementary to the Pure Food Law with ample 
appropriation for its enforcement. Moreover, in 1913, the 
Secretary of Agriculture appointed outside experts to in- 
spect meat-packing establishments throughout the country. 
This inspection is to check up the regular work being done 
by the Bureau of Animal Industry. 

The enforcing of federal and state laws has already largely 
stopped the misbranding of package foods as to weight or 
measure, cheap substitutions, the removal of valuable in- 
gredients, and the sale of decomposed or tainted food derived 
from diseased animals. Remember that abuses can be kept 
down to any extent that we are willing to pay for. Tax- 
payers must appropriate money to pay for inspection, for 
laws, no matter how good, will not insure pure food unless 
carried out faithfully by an adequate number of specially 
trained inspectors. 

In the face of all these difficulties we must not be frightened 
into that state of mind where danger seems to lurk in every 
mouthful. We must use caution and common sense in our 
buying, and earnestly support every good movement for 
bettering conditions. 

There is a certain difference in quality even at a first class 
dealer's that one must learn to distinguish. One can of 
peaches will cost more than another, because the peaches are 



292 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

larger. If it is only this, and there is only a slight difference 
in flavor in favor of the more costly, buy the cheaper by all 
means. A fancy brand of imported preserves brings a fancy 
price which it is not worth while to pay. We have to learn 
to distinguish between poor and good quality, on the one 
hand, and between good and what may be called " fancy," 
on the other. We should demand the good, but most of us 
cannot afford the " fancy." 

Ready-cooked foods. More and more cooked food, 
canned or otherwise, is taking its place in the market. When 
canned goods were first manufactured on a large scale they 
comprised fruits, vegetables, meats, and fish, but we are now 
accustomed to a miscellaneous variety, including soups, 
baked beans, puddings, and pudding sauces, spaghetti, 
hashed meat, and shellfish. Bakery products have a larger 
sale than ever, and are found in small towns, and even in 
country districts carried there by bakers' wagons. In our 
large cities we find the " delicatessen shop " very common, 
where small portions of cooked meats and fowl may be pur- 
chased after the custom of Europe, and these stores are open 
even on Sunday. 

How shall we decide what is best for us in our buying? 
We must not condemn entirely the buying of cooked food 
without a careful study of the situation. The custom has 
grown with changes in our mode of living, especially in cities, 
where the small apartment is common, and where gas is the 
fuel. Under these conditions it is difficult to prepare foods 
that need long and slow cooking, and these processes are 
more expensive when gas is used. The long slow cooking of 
soup and beans, the even baking of bread, are difficult to 
accomplish. The odors from these processes fill the small 
apartment, and scent it for some time, and this is unpleasant 
at all seasons. 



THE COST AND PURCHASING OF FOOD 293 

Take another example, the canning and preserving of 
fruits. The first cost of the fruit is usually high in the city, 
and this plus the sugar and the gas, and the labor and the 
lack of storage space make it seem impracticable in these 
conditions, and many people decide in favor of buying goods 
already canned. Such housekeeping is simplified by buying 
cooked products to some extent. The fireless cooker helps 
here, but not for all processes. Counting in fuel, the cost is 
not so much greater as we might suppose ; and comfort and 
convenience are increased. Under other conditions, even in 
the city, a different conclusion is reached. If coal is the fuel, 
and a steady fire is kept, perhaps in winter for heating pur- 
poses, then it is economy to cook most food materials at 
home. 

In the country and small village different conditions pre- 
vail. Here the abundance of certain fruits in season makes 
it economical to can and dry, even counting fuel and labor. 
In some sections many people can their own vegetables also. 
However, even in the country in the summer, it is a decided 
relief to the farmer's wife, probably short of " help/' to win 
a little leisure by buying staple bakery products. Here if 
strict economy is not necessary, is it not better to save 
strength rather than money ? Each housekeeper must work 
out these problems for herself.

CHAPTER XVIII 
MENUS AND DIETARIES 1 

WHEN we have learned to choose and cook wholesome and 
appetizing food we have not solved the whole problem of 
successful feeding. It is possible to make people sick with 
good food, if it is badly selected and fed at wrong times or in 
unsuitable amounts. Whether children grow to their full 
size and strength depends more upon the choice of their 
food than upon any other one thing. The effect of food is 
strikingly shown in the case of the white rats in Fig. 74. 
The two upper ones are the same age. Both had the same 
mother, lived in the same kind of clean cages, and had plenty 
of food, but the diet of the upper was good for growth, while 
that for the middle one was not. It remained perfectly well, 
but became stunted because of the character of its food. You 
can see that it resembles the lowest one in the illustration, 
which is only one fourth as old. In this chapter we shall 
consider how and when and in what amounts to serve food 
so that every one may get from it the fullest benefit in both 
health and happiness. 

In Chapter I we learned that the body is a working machine 
whose first requirement is fuel. Hence the first considera- 
tion in the diet is to have the proper amount of fuel for each 
day, to provide energy for the constant internal work that 
keeps the body alive, and for the variable external work

which may be so light as to consist of the few movements 
that one makes lying in bed, or sitting quietly ; or so hard 
as to exercise many muscles, as playing tennis, bicycling, or 
swimming. 

Energy requirements of adults. We have also learned 
something about the foods which supply this energy; we 
must now find out how much fuel (in the form of food) it 
takes to do different amounts of work, just as the owner of 
an automobile wants to know how much gasoline per mile 
or per hour is required to run his machine under different 
conditions. Very careful experiments have been made on 
many men in different ways to measure their energy output,

the most accurate and interesting being those made in a 
respiration calorimeter, a device so delicate as to be able to 
measure the extra heat given off when one changes from lying 
perfectly quiet to sitting up equally still, thus adding the 
work of holding the upper part of the body upright. A 
respiration calorimeter large enough to hold a child is shown 
in Figs. 75 and 76. You can see that it consists of a chamber

is open. When an experiment is going on the door is closed,

walls are fitted with delicate thermometers and every device

which will help to get the exact amount of heat given off 
from the body is employed. 

Just as it takes more fuel to run a big machine than a 
little one, so it takes more energy for a large person than a 
small one; therefore we must know the weight of the one 
whose food requirements we wish to calculate, as well as the 
amount of energy required to do different kinds and amounts 
of work. The following table will help in calculating the 
approximate fuel requirements of any grown person. The 
food needs of children and young people under twenty-five 
will be discussed later.

At severe muscular exercise 3.0 

Light exercise may be understood to include work equiv- 
alent to standing and working with the hands, as at a desk 
in chemistry or cookery ; or work involving the feet like walk- 
ing or running a sewing machine. Many persons, as stu- 
dents, stenographers, seamstresses, bookkeepers, teachers, and 
tailors do little or no work heavier than this. 

Active exercise involves more muscles, as in bicycling 
compared with walking, or exercise with dumb-bells as com- 
pared with typewriting. Carpenters, general houseworkers, 
and mail carriers do about this grade of work while on duty. 

Severe exercise not only involves a good many muscles, 
but causes enough strain to harden and enlarge them. Bicy- 
cling up grade, swimming, and other active sports would be 
included in this kind of exercise. Lumbermen, excavators, 
and a few others do even heavier work than this. 



300 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Knowing the weight of a grown man or woman, and some- 
thing of the daily occupation, as in the case of a professional 
man, we can estimate the probable energy requirement 
somewhat as follows : 

Sleeping, 8 hours ; 8 X 0.4 Calories = 3.2 Calories per pound. 
Sitting quietly (at meals, reading, etc.), 8 hours ; 8 X 0.6 Calories 

= 4.8 per pound. 
At light muscular exercise (dressing, standing, walking, etc.), 

6 X 1.0 Calories = 6.0 Calories per pound 
At active muscular exercise 2 hours, 2 x 2.0 Calories 

= 4 Calories per pound. 

Total Calories per pound for 24 hours, 18; 18 X 154 pounds 
(the weight of the average man) = 2772, or approximately 
2680, Calories per day required. Calculate in this way the 
energy requirement for various grown persons whom you 
know. 

Energy requirements during growth. In estimating food 
requirements of those who are under twenty-five years old, 
we must bear in mind that the same materials which serve 
for fuel serve in part for building material. Protein is used 
for muscle building as well as for supplying energy, and the 
larger one grows, the greater the reserves of carbohydrate 
and fat which he can carry. Furthermore, internal activity 
is greater in the young than the middle aged or very old, and 
external activity is 'apt also to be greater. Think, for in- 
stance, how much running children do compared with their 
parents. For all these reasons, we cannot use the table for 
adults in calculating the energy requirement of young people. 
In the following table an attempt has been made to take ac- 
count of their greater needs, but the estimates include only 
moderate exercise; with hard work more will be required. 
Notice that the highest allowance per pound of body weight 
is for the youngest children.

With these two tables for calculating energy requirement 
we can determine about how much will be needed by each 
member of the family. A group consisting of a professional 
man, his wife, and three children under 16 will require about 
10,000 Calories per day; a workingman's family with the 
same number of children from 12,000 to 14,000, because of 
the harder work which both parents and possibly the chil- 
dren will do. 

Protein requirement. Since few of our foods consist 
of a single foodstuff, and we are not likely to make even a 
single meal on pure fat, or pure protein, or pure carbohydrate 
alone, we are sure to get some building material in any diet, 
but we must see to it that we are getting amounts which 
furnish the best possible conditions for growth and repair. 

As we have already seen, nitrogen in the form of protein 
is necessary to the life of every cell in the body. From pro- 
tein, too, muscle is built, though we cannot build good muscle 
merely by feeding protein ; a diet moderate in its amount of 
protein, but with plenty of fuel for healthy exercise is best 
for muscle building. Under all ordinary conditions, if ten 
to fifteen Calories in every hundred (10 to 15 per cent of the 
total Calories) are from protein, the need for this kind of 
building material will be met. Thus a family requiring 
10,000 Calories per day should have from 1000 to 1500 of 
these as protein Calories. The following table gives the pro- 



302 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT

food materials.

Notice that 'some foods, like bread, have about the right 
proportion of protein calories ; others, like beef, beans, and 
peas are very high in protein calories. By combining some 
foods high in protein with others containing little or none, we 
can get the right proportion. Thus, 100 Calories of beef 
combined with 400 each of bread and butter will give 900 
Calories of which 114, or 12.7 per cent, are from protein.

It is interesting to work out other combinations which give 
these good proportions. 

Ash requirement. We are also assured of ash in any ordi- 
nary diet, but some attention should be paid to kind and 
amount, especially as many common foods have lost the parts 
richest in ash. Patent flour, for instance, made from the 
inner part of the grain, is not so rich in ash as whole or cracked 
wheat. Valuable salts are also lost in cooking vegetables 
when the water in which they were cooked is thrown away. 
If not desired with the vegetable, this should be saved for 
gravy or soup. It is not necessary to calculate a definite 
amount of ash for the diet, if ash-bearing foods are freely 
used. By reference to the table on page 384 you can see what 
foods are valuable for supplying the important kinds of ash. 
Milk is particularly rich in calcium and hence is required 
when the bones are growing. Eggs have iron and phosphorus 
in forms well suited to growth. But if eggs are too expensive, 



304 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the vegetables and fruits generally will supply these same 
substances. 

Diet for growth. Diets made in the chemical labora- 
tory from mixtures of pure (isolated) protein, fat, carbohy- 
drate, and ash to satisfy all the requirements which we have 
so far mentioned, do not behave alike when fed to animals. 
The kind of protein is important as well as the amount. 
This is shown by experiments in which only one protein is 
fed at a time. On some, the animals will not thrive. On 
others, adult animals do very well, but the young ones be- 
come stunted like the one shown on page 296. Milk has 
been found to contain proteins on which young animals can 
thrive. But even in diets containing the protein from milk, 
young animals do not develop normally unless the salts of 
milk are added too. No perfect substitute for milk has ever 
been found. During the first year of life, a child lives on it 
almost exclusively ; for the first five years it should be con- 
sidered the most important article in the diet ; and through- 
out the period of growth it should be freely used if children 
are to become vigorous men and women. If not liked as a 
beverage, it can be used in cocoa, or cereal coffee, in soups, 
puddings, and other dishes. Considering what milk may 
save in the way of more expensive protein foods, such as eggs 
and meat, and of ash-supplying foods like fruits and vege- 
tables, it is to be regarded as a cheap food. It is possible to 
get the proper amounts of fuel and protein from white bread 
and meat, but such a diet is poorly balanced as to ash con- 
stituents and especially lacks calcium. It would need to be 
balanced by adding some fruit or vegetable and even then 
would not contain as much calcium as is best for growing 
people. A diet of bread and milk, on the other hand, is so 
nearly perfectly balanced (supplying fuel, protein, and ash 
constituents in suitable amounts) that it can be taken ex- 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 305 

clusively for a long time. Whole wheat bread and milk 
would be even better, because the whole wheat would supply 
more iron, in which white bread and milk are not rich. The 
addition of fruits and vegetables to the bread and milk diet 
would also be an advantage partly for the same reason. N 

Other foods especially valuable for growth are eggs and 
cereals from whole grains. Children should acquire the 
habit of eating fruits and green vegetables of all kinds, for 
when they are older and likely to take less milk and cereals, 
the fruits and vegetables supply important ash constituents 
and also help to prevent constipation. 

The foods good for children are also good for adults, but 
the latter can keep their bodies in good repair with less 
protein and ash in proportion to body weight than are re- 
quired during growth, and many kinds of protein serve for 
repair. If there are not enough milk and eggs to go around, 
adults can take meat, nuts, peas, beans and bread for protein, 
and trust to these and fruit and vegetables for ash. When 
the body has been wasted by sickness, however, a return to 
the foods of growth, especially a diet of milk and eggs, is 
best for building it up again. 

The number of meals in a day. Knowing how much and 
what kinds of food are best for each member of the family, 
we must next find out how to divide the total food for the 
day into meals. Few of us could take our required fuel in 
one meal, and if we could, we should probably be hungry 
before the time for the next meal. Some persons get along 
very well with two meals a day, but usually their fuel re- 
quirement is not high. Most people are more comfortable 
and more likely to eat a suitable amount in a deliberate 
fashion if they have three meals a day. When large amounts 
of fuel have to be taken, four or five meals may be better than 
three ; babies who have to eat in proportion to their size, 



306 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

often 2J times as much as their mothers, take 2J times as 
many meals, i.e. 7 or 8 in a day. 

The amount of food for each meal. While the number 
of meals depends largely on the amount to be eaten in the 
whole day, and the appetite of the subject, the amount at each 
meal is most influenced by the nature of the daily occupation. 
The baby with nothing to do but eat and sleep has meals 
uniform in kind and amount. The business man who works 
very hard through the middle of the day, and has not time 
to take an elaborate meal, nor time to rest after it so that it 
may digest easily, takes a light luncheon and makes up for it 
at breakfast and dinner. The outdoor worker who has a long 
hard day and expends much energy, takes an hour at noon for 
a substantial dinner, in addition to a hearty breakfast and 
supper and sometimes a mid-forenoon or mid-afternoon lunch. 

Regularity of meals. More important than the number 
of meals is regularity as to time of eating and amount of 
food. Training for the digestive tract is just as important 
as training the eye or the hand or the brain. We cannot 
expect good digestions if we have a hearty luncheon to-day, 
none at all to-morrow, and perhaps a scanty and hasty late 
one the next day. To take food into the stomach between 
meals is to demoralize the digestive system. Foods that 
are excellent as part of a meal provoke headaches and bad 
complexions, and many symptoms of a protesting stomach, 
when taken between meals. The younger the person, the 
more important is regularity. Little children soon suffer if 
their meals are not " on the minute." Adults have more 
difficulty in controlling their time, but if they have to be 
late to meals, they should be more careful than usual to eat 
slowly and to choose plain simple food that will digest easily. 

Mental attitude toward meals. Good food may be pro- 
vided at the proper time and yet the members of a family 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 307 

may fail to keep well and happy unless they come to meals 
in the right condition. Haste, chill, exhaustion, anxiety, 
excitement, fretfulness, or anger may interfere with the 
digestion of the most digestible of meals. Orderly table 
service, good manners, and cheerful conversation are very 
important factors in the success of a meal. Peace and joy 
as well as " calories" are watchwords of good nutrition. 

Balanced meals. Having determined how many meals 
to serve in the day and what their hours shall be, the next 
question is how to choose and distribute the constituents of 
the day's ration so as to promote digestibility and satisfac- 
tion. A meal of pure protein, or fat, or carbohydrate would 
not be relished, and would have some physiological disad- 
vantages. Digestion is likely to be more complete on a 
mixed diet. A meal of carbohydrate alone leaves the stom- 
ach more quickly than any other kind, and one would feel 
hungry before the next meal, though one might have had 
plenty of fuel ; a meal of fat alone would leave the stomach 
very slowly, and one would not have so good an appetit.e 
for the next meal ; a meal of pure protein would stimulate 
heat production without any particular advantages, except 
possibly in very cold weather : it would be decidedly undesir- 
able in hot weather. For these and other reasons it is best 
to have the different foodstuffs represented in each meal, 
and to see that no one contains an excess of fat, which tends 
to retard all digestion. This is what is usually meant by a 
balanced meal, but it may also include care that about the 
same proportion of fuel is served at the same meal each day. 
A meal does not need to be " balanced " in quite the same 
sense as a day's ration. The latter must have a definite 
amount of fuel, a suitable proportion of protein, ash well 
represented, some food for bulk, the whole selected with 
regard for the physical condition, tastes, habits, and pocket- 
books of those to be fed. 



308 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Menus. Food taken at a stated time constitutes a meal. 
It may consist of a single food material, as bread, or a single 
dish, as soup; or it may contain many kinds of food and 
many dishes. When the day's ration consists of a single food, 
there is no trouble in arranging the bill of fare, for all meals 
are alike. But as soon as we have two foods, we may con- 
sider whether they will digest better if eaten together or 
separately, and which way they will please the palate better. 
Balanced diets do not necessarily afford attractive menus. 
Macaroni and oatmeal would make a fairly well balanced 
meal except as regards ash constituents, but no one would call 
such a combination pleasing. By the substitution of a little 
cheese and an orange for the oatmeal, a meal containing 
about the same fuel value and proportion of protein could be 
arranged, and it would certainly appeal more to the appetite, 
and furnish better proportions of ash constituents. 

In the construction of the menu for the day or meal, we 
must consider not only food values and time of day and com- 
binations which shall be digestible, but flavor, color, texture, 
and temperature of our foods. The study of digestible com- 
binations belongs to the science of nutrition. The harmoni- 
ous blending of tastes, odors, colors, and the like is an art. 
Just as there are pleasing combinations of sound, so there 
are harmonies of flavor; certain dishes seem naturally to 
" go together." Habit has a great deal to "do with food 
combinations. A Chinaman would not eat sugar on rice; 
a Japanese would not cook beans with molasses as the Bos- 
tonian does. It is interesting to experiment with new com- 
binations, and study to find out why old ones are pleasing. 
Why do we like crackers with soup? Butter on bread? 
Toast with eggs? Peas with lamb chops? 

Digestible menus. Some of our eating habits are worth 
preserving and cultivating. Fresh fruit for breakfast stimu-

lates the appetite and helps to prevent or overcome constipa- 
tion. A mild-flavored food like cereal is better relished be- 
fore we have had meats or other highly flavored food. Soup 
at the beginning of a meal puts the stomach in better condi- 
tion to digest the food that follows. Ice cream at the end 
of a meal is less likely to chill the stomach than at the be- 
ginning. Bread and butter afford a good combination of 
fat and carbohydrate. Crackers help in the breaking up of 
cheese into particles easy to digest. 

Not all of our eating habits are good, however. Griddle- 
cakes, melted butter, and maple sirup taste good, but the 
cakes make a pasty mass difficult for digestive juices to pene- 
trate. The sirup is likely to ferment, and the butter coating 
the whole delays digestion greatly. Chicken salad is popu- 
lar, but combinations of protein with much fat (as in the 
mayonnaise dressing) always digest very slowly. Simple 
dishes, without rich sauces or gravies, and not excessively 
high in fat, are easiest of digestion. Pastries, fried foods, 
meats with much fat, like pork and sausage, are always more 
or less difficult and should be attempted only by the strong, 
or when the body is free from physical or nervous weariness, 
and not about to undertake mental work. 

Attention to the art of menu making not only helps to 
make the diet easier to digest, but also better balanced. 
Foods which are similar in color, flavor, and texture, like 
potatoes and rice, are not artistic in combination, and it is 
better to substitute for one of them a green vegetable, or 
meat or butter, in which case we get a better balance, as 
more ash, protein, or fat would then be included with the 
starch of the rice or potato. 

In making the bill of fare it is a great mistake to consider 
each meal by itself alone. If we do so, some days are likely 
to be very high in fuel, while others may be very low. Then, 



310 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



too, the impression left from one meal carries over to the next. 
We do not care to see on the dinner table the same foods that 
we saw at luncheon. Our love of variety is one of nature's 
ways of seeing to it that we get different kinds of foodstuffs in 
our diet. Variety stimulates appetite, but this does not 
mean a great variety at one meal. The truest variety is ob- 
tained by a few well-selected dishes at each meal. If we do not 
exhaust our resources on one meal, we shall be able to have a 
greater range of foods in the course of a week. A hotel may 
have fifty or sixty items on its bill of fare, but after a few days 
one feels as if there were a great sameness, because all of 
them are impressed on the mind at each meal and every day. 

Dietaries. A dietary, as we shall use the term here, 1 is 
a statement of the food requirements of a person or group of 
persons for a day or some other definite length of time, with 
a selection of foods to satisfy this requirement. 

The first part of a family dietary will have to be calculated 
according to the age, weight, and occupation, as stated on 
pages 299-303. When complete, it will stand somewhat like 
this :

also called dietary studies, whether the observed dietary is such as to satisfy 
the food requirement or not. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 311 

In selecting food to satisfy these requirements it is a good 
plan to make first a list of those foods that need to be in- 
cluded in the day's dietary, no matter what the particular 
menu may be. This will include foods for growth where 
there are children, special dishes needed if any one is sick, 
and those common foods which we are accustomed to include 
in every day's menu, such as bread and butter. 

For the family which we are considering, this list will stand 
somewhat as follows : 

FOOD IOO-CALORIE PORTIONS 

Milk ..-.. . 20 1 (6 for each child, the rest 

for the adults) 

Cereal . . . 5 

Eggs (for children) * . .. , 2 (counting f portion per egg) 

Fruit 5 

Green vegetable 2 

Meat or meat substitute .... 5 

Bread -....; 15 

Butter .... .= . . . . . 15 

This list is to be kept in planning the menu, whose char- 
acter is further determined by certain dishes which we wish 
particularly to have included. For instance, we may desire 
roast beef for dinner. This is a highly flavored meat, and a 
protein food which will go a long way towards satisfying the 
adult's protein needs. Special protein food for breakfast 
may well be omitted, or take the form of eggs, which are a 
contrast to the meat in flavor, form, etc. Protein food for 
luncheon might be fish or some other meat substitute. 

Vegetables for dinner should not only harmonize with the 
meat, but contrast pleasingly with each other. This result 
is insured by choosing one vegetable from the starchy type, 
as potatoes or sweet potatoes, and the other vegetable of the 
green or succulent group, as spinach or asparagus. 

Below are two menus, in which have been kept in mind the

we have well-balanced dietaries. Let us take, for example,

It is evident that we have enough protein, and as a good 
share of it is from milk, we know that it will satisfy the 
children's requirements in the best possible way. The adults 
will get theirs largely from the salmon and meat. Compar- 
ing this list with our first tentative one, we find that we 
have used in building up our dietary 21 portions of milk, 
5 of cereal, 5 of fruit (not including lemon juice), 4.1 of green 
vegetable, 8 of meat (including salmon), 18 of bread, and 22 
of butter, but no eggs. We have a good representation of the 
different kinds of foodstuffs, with this exception, and as the 
'boys would need the eggs most, we could put them in for 
their breakfast, thus adding about 140 total Calories and 50 
protein Calories. With this addition we are still slightly 
deficient in total energy, but to add one or two hundred 
Calories is a very simple matter. A second serving of pota- 
toes, an extra roll for those whose fuel requirement is highest, 
or a slightly more liberal use of butter, might well solve the 
problem. This dietary calculation shows how the menu 
may help in getting a balanced diet, and how knowledge of 
food values can be applied as a check on the menu. If we 
had had fewer dishes in each meal, we should have had to 
plan to serve larger portions of some or all of them, or to use 
more freely such staples as bread, butter, and milk. 

Each family must find out the kind of menu best suited 
to its resources. Some typical meal plans suitable for 
everyday use are given below.

More elaborate plans than these should usually be reserved for 
state occasions. 

The cost of the dietary. The types of menu used will 
depend very largely upon the income of the family. ' It is 
comparatively easy to plan attractive bills of fare if one does 
not have to consider the amount of work involved in prepar- 
ing them, or the cost of the materials to be used. With 
knowledge of food values an expensive dietary may be whole- 
some, but there is great temptation to overeating and waste 
of food, and it is wise to keep meals simple for the sake of 
good digestion. Most families have to consider carefully 
the cost of food if any money is to be saved for books or 
travel or emergencies. A dietary such as planned on page 
313 will probably cost from $1.50 to $2.00 for the day, or 
from 1 J to 2 cents per 100 Calories, depending on the locality. 
Nothing is allowed for waste, which may, if the cook and those 
who eat the food are not careful, amount to from 10 to 15 



316 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

per cent of the total cost. It is often estimated that the 
" average " man will consume about 3000 Calories per day, 
and the cost may be expressed on this basis as from 45 to 
60 cents per man per day ; or the dietary spoken of as a 45- 
cent or 60-cent dietary or whatever the exact cost per 3000 
Calories may be. The cost of food for such a family for a 
year would at this rate be from $550 to $750. 

If the allowance for food be placed at 25 per cent of the 
total income, 1 this dietary would be appropriate for a family 
with an income of $2200 to $3000 per year. The majority 
of families have to get along with a lower expenditure for 
food, yet they want to be well nourished and to enjoy their 
fare. Fortunately there is no real connection between cost 
and nutritive value, some of the most nutritious foods being 
among the cheapest. At the same time, we cannot get 
wholesome food for nothing. There are very few foods which 
to-day cost less than J of a cent per 100 Calories, and these 
are mostly cereal products, such as cornmeal, rolled oats, 
and flour, or sugars and molasses. These alone will not 
make 'a well-balanced, palatable dietary, though they will 
supply all the fuel needed for an " average " man for a day 
for ten cents. In many parts of the country to-day it is 
hardly possible to make a dietary satisfactory week in and 
week out with an average allowance of less than f of a cent 
per 100 Calories, and even this sum will prove satisfactory 
only provided there be skill in food preparation as well as 
food selection. With an allowance of 1 cent per 100 Calories 
it is possible almost anywhere to make a balanced dietary 
with some attractiveness in appearance and flavor. In 

1 The apportionment of the income to the different expenses of living 
(food, clothing, shelter, etc.) is discussed in Chapter XIX. It will be found 
that the smaller the income the higher is the percentage of it which must 
be allowed for food.

choosing foods with regard to cost a table that shows which 
are cheap fuel and which dear, is a great help. Prices vary 
so much with place and season that it is difficult to make 
one which is very exact, and some rearrangement to suit 
any particular region may be necessary. The table on page 
317 will, however, serve as a guide. 

Inspection of this table shows that if we can afford only 
one cent per 100 Calories for food, we must get a large share 
from Group I, and a few from Group II ; if we wish to use 
foods in Group III, we shall have to do so sparingly, or offset 
them with some of the very cheapest in Group I, to keep the 
average as we wish it. 

When we plan an attractive menu and find it is too ex- 
pensive for us, we may often carry out our plan by substitut- 
ing cheaper foods of the same sort. Thus in the dietary on 
page 313 we may substitute as follows : 

Bananas for oranges. 

Top milk for cream. 

Oleomargarine for a part of the butter. 

Bean loaf with tomato sauce for creamed salmon and peas. 

Stewed apricots for pears. 

Rump roast instead of rib roast. 

Doing this, omitting the soup and crackers and the salad 
for dinner, and increasing bread and potatoes, flaked wheat, 
and other cheaper foods to prevent any deficiency in fuel, 
we can still prepare palatable and digestible meals with the 
right food values, and save perhaps 25 per cent on the total 
cost for the day. 

Feeding the sick. When illness is serious enough for a 
physician to be consulted, he will give directions concerning 
the diet, and these should be scrupulously followed. If the 
case is so severe as to demand a trained nurse, she will have 
charge of the feeding, under the physician's guidance. 



MENUS AND DIETARIES 319 

Many times, however, a member of the family is temporarily 
indisposed and needs food different from the ordinary family 
bill of fare. It is well to remember that in the first day or 
two of illness, fasting or taking of very little food does no 
harm, and may be an excellent help toward recovery, as it 
gives the digestive tract a chance to rest, if it has been 
disturbed. 

Nevertheless, the internal work of the body goes on, 0.4 
Calorie per pound per hour being expended during sleep, and 
about 0.6 Calorie per pound per hour during waking hours 
in bed. A person in bed for twenty-four hours will require 
about 0.5 Calorie per pound per hour to prevent use of body 
material for fuel. A man of average weight, lying in bed, 
will thus need about 1850 calories per day. Hence we must 
see to it, that after a person has been sick for more than a 
few days (during which he can afford to burn body fat) enough 
fuel is given to satisfy his energy requirements if he can pos- 
sibly digest it. 

Food for an invalid must always be given in its most diges- 
tible forms. Milk is one of the most valuable foods in sick- 
ness, not only because it supplies so many body needs, but 
because it can be used in so many ways, hot, or cold, 
flavored or plain, made into junkets or sherbets, combined 
with eggs in eggnogs and custards, fermented as in kumyss 
or soured as in buttermilk or zoolak. In some form or other 
milk can almost always be made digestible. Eggs are also 
of great value, not only poached or dropped and served on 
toast, but as dainty omelets, or in beverages, as eggnog, egg 
lemonade, and orangeade. Mild fruit juices, as orange, 
grape, or pineapple, are not only refreshing but of considerable 
fuel value. If there is no fever, chicken, lamb chops, tender 
broiled steak or roast beef may serve to add variety to the 
menu. Broths stimulate the appetite and help digestion, 



320 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

though they are of little or no food value themselves. Cereals, 
eggs, and milk may be added to increase their food value. 
Cereals in the form of gruels or delicate puddings, as corn- 
starch blancmange and tapioca cream, are easily digested. 
Vegetables are best given rather sparingly, and only delicate, 
mild-flavored ones, such as spinach or asparagus, if digestion 
is much disturbed. In getting an invalid to take sufficient 
food, much depends upon the attractiveness of the service. 
Remember that very little things, like a fingermark on a 
glass, or coffee spilled into the saucer, may take away appetite 
and prevent enough food being eaten. Food in small quan- 
tities and taken at more frequent intervals than in health 
helps towards the best results. Knowledge of what particular 
diet is best in different diseases comes only through careful 
study of the science of nutrition after much study of chem- 
istry and physiology.

CHAPTER XIX 
THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 

THE divisions of the income for which we should provide 
are food, shelter, including taxes and operating expenses, 
clothing, and the " higher life," including recreation, educa- 
tion, and savings. The size of the income determines largely 
the proportion of money allotted to each division. We 
must be nourished and protected from the elements by shel- 
ter and clothing, and an income must at least provide for these 
necessities to be a living wage. Yet we justly claim some- 
thing more from our income than mere existence. 

In most families there is a fairly definite income. When 
the amount is not known it is wise to estimate upon the 
minimum income and have a surplus, rather than to expend 
too much. Seventy-five years ago things cost less and in- 
comes were less, to-day the incomes have increased and cost 
of living is growing higher. The question is one to be 
studied relatively, and the cost of living will depend on the 
ratio between income and one's methods of living. 

Just what other satisfactions than the merely physical 
are to be gratified is the great question for the woman who 
divides the income. The problem is naturally hardest with 
the smallest income, where the " must be " crowds out the 
" may be." But there is room for choice even with the small 
wage. 

This work of dividing the income and deciding on the ideals 
should be shared by the family. When the home is first 
started the husband and wife should discuss frankly the prob- 
T 321 



322 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

lems of division and should agree on the methods of expen- 
.diture. This common understanding between members of a 
family forms a bond of union, and each feels a greater pleas- 
ure and pride in doing his part. The fact that there is a 
budget and a system brings orderliness in methods of work 
and freedom from worry and anxiety as well as a saving of 
money. And this saving of money and strength is the same 
as an increase in income. This budget or division of ex- 
penses acts as a sailing chart and can be referred to from 
month to month. It should not, however, become a burden, 
and one should not worry if every penny is not accounted for. 

Statisticians tell us that about 75 per cent of the male 
adults of our country earn somewhat less than $600 a year. 
That in large cities $900 to $1000 a year is necessary to bring 
up a family to live decently and enjoy human happiness. 
Much depends upon how this income is divided as to whether 
results will tend to develop efficiency in the members of such 
a family. As the income increases from $1000 to $5000 it is 
possible to apportion the income and indicate certain per- 
centages which represent wise family expenditures so as to 
include the higher intellectual and emotional life as well as 
the physical welfare of the family. 

From comparison of many budgets statisticians have 
worked out certain percentages that are helpful in making 
our decisions, although they are not to be taken as fixed rules. 

Expenditure for food. On examining the budgets of 
families having incomes from $500 to $5000, it is found that 
the percentage spent for food increases as the income de- 
creases, amounting sometimes to at least 50 per cent of the in- 
come. This means that there is a limit to the money spent 
per capita per day for food, below which we cannot go and 
maintain life with even sufficient efficiency for unskilled labor. 
Figure 77 shows that a $900 income gives about 45 per cent to

food. An expenditure of thirty cents per capita per day for 
food in a family of five with an income of $1500, is 36.5 per 
cent; i.e. more than one third of the total income. Sug-

come, and highly important with the larger where we are prone 
to yield to a foolish impulse to please a whim of the palate. 

Expenditure for shelter. The increased cost of building 
and the general advance in rentals make the expenditure for 
shelter a large one. 

The question whether homes should be owned or rented is 
a vital one. Ownership is possible for comparatively few, 
but there is probably nothing that contributes more to the 
upbuilding of a community and the development of good 
citizenship than the permanent residence of families in 
localities. The pride of the members is enlisted in the home, 
its surroundings and general community welfare. This 
sense of ownership makes a house more a home although real 
home spirit is not confined to ownership of buildings. There 
are of course advantages and disadvantages of ownership, 
and these should be carefully weighed. Preference for fresh 
air, more space, less crowded conditions even if they necessi- 
tate daily travel, have driven people of limited incomes and 
certain ideals from the crowded cities to the suburbs in search 
of homes. When it is possible it is certainly much more 
advantageous to own than to rent a home, when living means 
the attainment of certain ideals in the lives of the members of 
the family. 

In deciding upon the proper expenditure, we must take 
into account the location, whether convenient to business, 
school, and church, sanitary conditions in surroundings and 
in the house or apartment, the appearance of the house and 
the attractiveness of the neighborhood as well as its con- 
venience and healthfulness. The house should be adapted 
to the needs of the family and selected with this thought in 
mind. See the companion volume, "Shelter and Clothing," 
Chapters II and III. 

It has been estimated that 20 per cent of incomes ranging 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 325 

from $500 to $5000 will secure a home, not including operat- 
ing expenses, with the proper sanitary conditions and one 
which will contribute to a right standard of living. If neces- 
sary to secure healthful surroundings more than 20 per cent 
may need to be spent, but 25 per cent of the income is the 
limit of the amount to be spent upon rent unless this also 
includes heat (as in many apartments) when as much as 
28 per cent may be so spent. If more than this is paid, it is 
practically impossible to avoid debt when any unforeseen 
contingency arises. One thrifty German woman used 30 
per cent of the small family income for rent, in order to have 
more bedrooms than most tenement-house dwellers can 
afford. She did make ends meet by working until midnight 
at the family sewing, and tailoring ; but though she was the 
very soul of thrift in regard to food, and had never called 
in a doctor, she could not save money until the children 
began to earn. 

Operating expenses. The question of operating expense 
is closely associated with the selection of shelter and should 
be carefully considered with it in the division of the income. 
They are the expenses necessary to keep the house clean, 
warm, lighted, insured, and in constant repair. To these 
must be added in a suburban community water tax, property 
tax, perhaps even a fire tax. 

In city apartments, heat and hot water are often furnished, 
and this must be taken into account in deciding between 
apartment and house, and between renting and ownership. 

Labor is an important item in the running of the house. 
The close connection of selecting and operating a home will 
be seen. Should the administrator divide the family income 
in such a way that little is left for operating, the little things 
of everyday life become a constant source of worry. 

The questions of the number of rooms, and their care, 



326 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

relative expense of heating by furnace, steam, or hot water, 
the cost of regular service in wages per week in order to 
attain one's ideals, the cost of extra service, the lighting by 
gas, oil, or electricity are all problems of operating. Knowl- 
edge of sanitary science will make the homemaker demand 
cleanliness in her surroundings, quick disposal of waste, and 
the prompt removal of dust. Much care in planning is 
necessary here in order that there may be no leakage and that 
there may be the full share of comfort for each member. 

For the income of from $500 to $5000 it has been estimated 
that a proportion of from 10 to 20 per cent must usually be 
spent for operating in order to secure comfort. Much must 
necessarily depend upon the amount of hired service required, 
which, in turn, depends largely upon whether the homemaker 
is to give her time chiefly to the care of her children or chiefly 
to the conduct of the housework. 

Clothing. A large proportion of the family income is 
spent on clothing. A knowledge of textiles and of purchasing 
is necessary in order to do this wisely and economically. 
Clothing is as necessary an expense as food, for it con- 
serves the heat which the food furnishes and thus main- 
tains body temperature. Health is the main factor in 
efficiency, and health is preserved by clothing which protects 
the body from sudden changes in temperatures, and con- 
serves the energy for other purposes. Money should be 
spent on clothing to secure health, but too often more than 
the right percentage of income is expended because of love 
of display. The instinct for show, color, ornamentation 
is a primitive one, and the aesthetic " want " is, in one sense, 
as real as the physical and should be considered in expendi- 
tures for this purpose. It is a duty to look well, but it is not 
necessary, nor does it show good sense, to sacrifice the health, 
happiness, and higher life of the family by economizing on 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 327 

food and other essentials in order to secure hats, shoes, gowns, 
and accessories that cater to a mania for show. If the in- 
come be limited so that the essentials of clothing only can 
be purchased, the margin of income which can be spent for 
pleasure may, if taste so dictates, be spent on clothing instead 
of pictures, books, or some recreation. That is a matter for 
the individual or family to decide. In the typical budgets 
cited below it will be seen that the expenditure for clothing 
was usually between 10 and 18 per cent. 

The higher life. There are other needs of family life 
for which money must be spent besides the material ones of 
food, shelter, and clothing. In the. division of some family 
incomes little thought is given to this phase of living. After 
the income reaches a certain amount, it is possible so to plan 
that education, recreation, philanthropy, and savings all 
figure in the division of expenditures. Some writers say 
that 25 per cent of the income of $1000 to $5000 should be 
spent in this way. If thought is given to this, it would mean 
opportunities for books, periodicals, lectures, and member- 
ship in societies ; some travel and vacation, social clubs, 
theaters and concerts; charity and church expenditures; 
life insurance and other savings. It is the idea of ownership 
of property, of homes, of possessions of all kinds that has 
led from primitive living to advanced civilization. And 
with advanced civilization comes the need for the higher life 
which should be satisfied and can be through wise division 
of funds. The choice of things to satisfy this higher life rests 
with the individual ; it may be music, it may be the culti- 
vation of altruistic feeling in the help given to neighbors ; 
it may be a bank account for some future good, or money 
spent on excursions, lectures, or theater. Whatever it is, it 
satisfies the emotional, spiritual, and intellectual life of man 
and distinguishes him as one of advanced civilization. 



328 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Savings. Something should be saved yearly even if at 
first it is but little. Small amounts put away regularly in a 
savings bank mount up to a considerable sum at compound 
interest, for regular saving is the only kind that counts. Life 
and sickness insurance are other forms of saving. 

Allowances. Each member of the family should have a 
personal allowance, even though it is small. One mother 
gave each of her children five cents a week, beginning at five 
years of age, and increasing a cent a week each year, until they 
were old enough to be trusted with more. Even at this age 
opposite characteristics showed themselves. One boy saved 
his allowance until he had a quarter to spend at one time ; 
another was in debt before the end of the week. Each had 
a bank, and kept accounts, as well. It is sometimes better 
for a child if he " earns " his allowances by performance of 
such household duties as seem best adapted to promote his 
development. 

Suggested and typical budgets. In preparation for the 
division of one's income it is helpful to study the budgets of 
other families or individuals. Mrs. Richards in her book on 
" The Cost of Living " gives a theoretical division of in- 
comes, which is shown in the accompanying table headed 
Suggested Budgets. It is interesting to study this account 
and then those of families who have worked out their prob- 
lems (either with or without the preparation of definite 
budgets in advance) as shown in the table of Typical 
Budgets. 

In New York City it has been estimated by those studying 
the problems of the cost of living of to-day that it is im- 
possible for the average family of mother, father, and three 
children under 14 years to get food enough to keep the 
body in good condition with clothing and shelter to meet 
the most urgent demands of decency for less than $900. 



THE HOUSEHOLD BUDGET 



329 



This amount in other localities would probably buy more. 
This means that in New York City for $900 a family of five 
can have a very bare existence, and that with $1000 this 
family can begin to maintain a decent standard of living 
unless there is long sickness or other catastrophe. At $1200 
a normal family standard can be maintained so as to preserve 
health, and so that the family will have opportunities to 
develop in a self-respecting manner. When one con- 
siders that many families subsist on $500 or $600 a year, 
it is necessarily under conditions of shelter and with 
limitations of food and clothing, not conducive to the best 
development.

CHAPTER XX 
SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 

THE housekeeper should learn to use the labor-saving de- 
vices for her records that are now employed so largely in the 
world of business. This equipment should include a desk 
with fittings for systematized and rapid work. A roll-top 
desk, with pigeonholes and drawers is convenient, but a flat- 
topped desk with drawers below gives a larger space for 
writing, although it has to be supplemented by boxes to take 
the place of pigeonholes. Such desks may be purchased for 
twenty dollars and upward, in woods to match other furni- 
ture. It is a pleasure to have artistic desk furnishings, but a 
large amount may be spent on these, and the desk still be un- 
equipped for practical purposes. 

Files and loose-leaf books. A card file is as advantageous 
to the housekeeper as to the business man. Some desks 
contain a place for the card file in the upper right-hand drawer. 

Guide cards are furnished in several colors to indicate 
divisions of the file, and these are plain, or with printed 
numbers and letters. The record cards also are made of 
several colors, to indicate different uses. The suggestions 
here cover only a few of the possibilities. Visit some office 
furnishing department or shop to see what an array of con- 
veniences has been devised for the dispatch of business. If 
you once form the habit, you will find new uses for the card 
file almost daily, and will keep on the cards, addresses, en- 
gagements, cash accounts, shopping lists, inventories of 

332 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 333 

clothing and furnishings, menus and recipes. A loose-leaf 
book is preferred by some people for inventories and accounts. 

A letter file shaped like a pocketbook can be purchased for 
only twenty-five cents, and will serve the purpose for a small 
correspondence. Large files with guide cards are made for a 
larger correspondence. 

The small file will answer for filing bills and is useful also 
for clippings. Some desks have bill files in the pigeonholes, 
and a letter file in one of the large drawers. 

Have regular hours daily for attending to work at the 
desk, stated times for planning menus, making shopping 
lists, looking over the inventories, recording expenditures, 
and balancing accounts. 

Order in time and place are studied further in the chapter 
on Housewifery. / 

Keeping of accounts. This has been called by many, 
drudgery and tedious routine. Many business men go 
through much such drudgery to attain their goals, why should 
not the housewife be willing to make a similar sacrifice in 
her home for the sake of the service she is rendering the 
members of her household ? The aim in keeping the accounts 
is to register the amounts spent for various purposes so that 
all phases of life will be considered and so that the manager 
will be able to profit the second year because of the expe- 
rience of the first year. This makes housekeeping interesting 
and businesslike. The expenditure is made to produce the 
maximum of value received and is accompanied by the 
greatest possible pleasure. 

In keeping accounts there should be some method of show- 
ing the receipts and expenses, the income and the outgo, so 
that a balance can be made at any time. The items should 
be so listed, too, that it is possible to tell what expenditure 
has been made for any one item, as rent, or food, or other 



334 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 



necessities. It is only in this way that the accounts become 
of value for future use. 

There are many ways of keeping such accounts. The 
simplest one for the housewife is the best if it shows the 
points mentioned above. The envelope system is used by 
some when the income is small, and a certain amount of 
money according to budget plan is put in labeled en- 
velopes for various purposes, as rent, food, operating ex- 
penses, etc. As sums are drawn from the various envelopes, 
a slip of paper put in the particular envelope registers the 
amount drawn. It is easy at the end of the month to balance 
the accounts. This system necessitates the presence of a 
good deal of money on hand, and sometimes of confusion of 
accounts, if money is borrowed from one envelope for use 
in another. 

Various systems of card catalogues, journals, and ledgers 
are in use, and all have more or less value. The simplest form 
for the average young woman or housewife can be kept in 
an ordinary blank book and the spaces ruled according to 
one's need. The account book can be started in somewhat 
the following manner, with the dates of expenditures in the 
first column and the respective amounts opposite under their

proper heads. In this way it is possible by using double 
pages of the blank book to keep all the items for each month 
in horizontal series. The columns for Lems of expenses 
should be ruled as needed, but it is desirable to keep them 
under as few heads as will suffice to give the information 
which may be desired. The use of the double page is ad- 
visable, for then the outer edge of the left-hand page can be 
used for the dates of purchase and plenty of room for columns 
of expense left across the two pages. The total in the various 
columns can be easily calculated at the end of the first month 
and a new set of pages ruled for the second. The expendi- 
tures should be entered daily so as not to be forgotten. A 
slip of paper kept in one's purse is of help if amounts are 
jotted down while one is shopping. The totals for each 
month should be entered in another part of the blank book. 
Rule spaces for the year with columns for the months across 
the page and items of expense corresponding to those in the 
daily entry at the left-hand side. In this way at the end of 
twelve months the totals for each item of expense can be easily 
found. If one desires to know from day to day of a month 
how the balance stands, it is possible to add to Form I two 
columns for this purpose. One column should show the in-

Total expenditure for year 



come or amounts received with dates, and the second the 
total sum expended each day. This sum is found by adding 
the expense of each item across the page for the day and 
entering in the expense column. 

Somewhere in the book there should be kept an account 
of the receipts from all sources. The balance of the yearly 
expense account with the sheet of receipt can be easily made. 

Some plan must be made for showing which purchases are 
paid for in cash, and which are charged. A simple method 
is to record the articles charged, with the place, date, and 
price on a card in the card file in a division kept for this pur- 
pose, and labeled " Purchases charged." When the bill is 
rendered, it can be checked up from these cards, and the 
purchases entered in the permanent account book. The 
record in the account book gives thus the date of payment,

but not the date of purchase, unless this is added too. The 
date of purchase can be recorded in the inventory of house- 
hold goods (see Chapter XXII). 

This simple method of keeping accounts enables one to 
look over the monthly and yearly expenses and to see if the 
expenditure is apportioned to the different divisions as it 
should be. If some of the needs of the physical or intellectual 
life are being neglected, it should be possible to cut down or 
readjust the next year to the satisfaction both of the house- 
wife and of her family. 

It is wise for all girls before they have homes of their own 
to keep account of their own small incomes. In many 
families daughters are given money for clothing and daily 
expenses. Some such system of keeping accounts as the 
above can be used. It is astonishing in examining ac- 



338 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

counts for clothing, to see how few maintain a correct balance. 
One girl found, by keeping accounts ; that she spent entirely 
too much for hats and gloves and did not have the proper 
underwear to protect her body and maintain the correct 
temperature for health. Accounts help us to determine 
whether our methods of living measure up to the ideals or 
standards of life which we have established in order to live 
rightly. 

Methods of payment. Payment is either immediate, 
known as " spot cash," or deferred. If deferred, the articles 
purchased are charged by the dealer, and a bill rendered the 
first of each month. When a charge account is opened, a 
good business reference must be given. According to another 
system, articles may be paid for in installments, that is, 
so much each month, according to some agreement. Of 
this method it may be said that it is unsafe, or at least 
unwise, always. Remember that more is always paid in 
the end. 

In either case the payment may be made in bills, specie, 
or by checks; although in ordinary shopping immediate 
payment is usually made in bills and specie. 

The advantage of immediate payment is that the buyer 
spends only what she has, and does not count on future 
money. This method of payment enables one to keep the 
balance well in hand. It necessitates, however, keeping 
bills and specie in the house, and in one's pocketbook, with 
the possibility of theft or loss ; and cash payment takes more 
time in the shop, with the long wait for change. Sending 
" collect on delivery " (C.O.D.) is a way of making cash 
payment and saving time at the shop. Be sure that in this 
case there is the exact change at home, and some one ready to 
receive the goods. 

Charging goods makes for economy of time. If you can 



SYSTEM IN MANAGEMENT 339 

remember that an article charged means money spent, this is 
a safe plan. One careful buyer says that she is too optimistic 
to have a charge account; too sure that while she has not 
cash enough to-day for something that she wants, she will 
surely have it by the first of next month. 

There is another method of payment introduced by a few 
large department stores. The firm requires a monthly de- 
posit at the first of each month and charges up purchases 
against this. This is good in so far that the customer is 
spending money that he really has, but it restricts purchases 
to that one shop, and this is inadvisable in the case of a small 
income. 

The bank account and check book. Whether payment 
is immediate or deferred, payment by check is a great con- 
venience. It saves time and is also a record of money paid. 

Select a bank, conveniently located, and recommended by 
a conservative business man. Take to the bank a letter of 
introduction, with the sum for deposit. The bank will 
record your signature, and give you a bank book in which is 
recorded the amount deposited. A check book will be given 
you that contains blank checks, and provides for keeping ac- 
count of deposits and checks drawn. Each check has to 
be filled in, and signed with your name exactly as recorded at 
the bank, when you make a payment. This must be re- 
corded in the proper place when the check is made out, stating 
date, amount, and payee. The sums paid out are added, 
usually for every three checks, and this sum deducted from 
the deposit, and the balance carried forward. In this way 
you may always know your balance in the bank, provided 
you are accurate. Great care must be taken to fill in the 
blank spaces correctly so that the check cannot be easily 
altered by any one. 

If a check is made out to you, and you wish to cash it, or 



340 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

deposit it, you " indorse " it by writing your name on the 
back across the left-hand end of the check. The name must 
be written exactly as it appears on the face of the check. 
If by chance the name is misspelled, write it in with the cor- 
rect spelling below. 

The checks that you make out are indorsed by the payee 
in the same way, and cannot be cashed until so indorsed. 
Therefore, if a check is lost in the mail, you do not lose the 
money. The bank should be notified to " stop payment " 
on the lost check, and you can then send another check in 
place of the first one. 

When you wish bills or specie, you go to the bank and 
present to the paying teller a check made out to " Cash " 
and signed by yourself. It is wise not to. make out or sign 
such a check until you reach the bank, because if such a 
check is lost on the way, there is danger of its being cashed 
by the finder. 

Once a month you should leave the book with the teller 
to be balanced. In a few days you may call for it, and will 
receive with it the checks that you have drawn, and that have 
been returned to the bank by the date to which the book is 
balanced. These checks are called vouchers. With these 
there is also a list of the amounts showing the total paid out 
on them by the bank. Check up the vouchers with the list, 
then check up the vouchers with your check book to see if 
all in your check book had been returned to the bank by the 
date of balancing. If there are some still out, add that 
sum to your check book balance, and then compare the bank 
book balance with your check book. 

Deposits may be sent by mail, either with or without the

CHAPTER XXI 
HOW TO BUY 

THE first rule in good buying is to know standard quality 
in your intended purchase, for then you need not be depend- 
ent upon the salesman. The second is to know your own 
needs, that you may not be beguiled by the clever advertise- 
ment in the daily paper, or the well-displayed bargain, and 
will not need to ask the salesman's advice about quantity. 
Keep lists of articles needed in the card file, and make your 
shopping lists from these. The third rule is to apportion 
your purchases to your income and the divisions of your 
budget. 

Where to buy. Patronize reliable firms. There are in 
any community shops of different grades, and you will not 
find the best return for your money always at those houses 
where there is the greatest parade of cut prices and bargains. 
In the end the reliable places are the cheapest. Sometimes a 
firm trades on its reputation and a degree of fashion it has 
attained, but on the whole it is true that if one house has 
goods uniformly cheaper than another, it is because the 
quality is inferior. 

One fact that a good shopper learns is this that certain 
articles may be purchased to greater advantage at one place 
than another. One firm excels in silks, another in household 
linen, another in coffee, and so on. 

Almost every community now has a " white list " and a 
branch of the Consumers' League, the significance of which 
was explained in " Shelter and Clothing," p. 202.

HOW TO BUY 343 

How to shop. Know the shops you patronize, first by 
personal inspection, unless, of course, you are ordering from 
a distance. 

Mail orders and the telephone are helps to the buyer. 
These should not entirely take the place of personal visits 
to the shops, but, if well used, save many weary hours. The 
parcel post makes possible buying by mail even perishable 
articles direct from the producer. Many country dwellers 
do a large part of their shopping even for clothing and fur- 
niture by mail, and there are reputable firms who cater largely 
to this trade, and send out well-illustrated price lists as guides. 
However, this method should be used very cautiously, and 
it may be unsatisfactory for articles where the aesthetic 
element is important, as well as the quality. 

Bargains, sales, and advertisements. Here the buyer 
matches her wit against the wiles of the seller. Bargain 
sales may be made up of sweat shop goods. Many women 
ignorant of textile production, flock to the sales of materials 
and garments, helping the storekeeper to dispose of silk 
which is rotting on his shelves, or garments which have 
been poorly or cheaply constructed and which go to pieces 
the first time laundered. Remnants are often cut from 
materials on the regular shelves, and sometimes are offered at 
an advance in price at the so-called bargain sales. In reliable 
shops one can sometimes find bargains during clearance sales. 
It pays to wait and buy out of season, as much can be saved 
in this way. A " best " hat in January, or a white dress in 
August, may often be purchased to advantage. In order to 
do this, one must plan the wardrobe systematically. 

Trading stamps and prizes. Remember that nothing is 
given away, and that you pay for everything that you receive. 
It is well to deal with a firm that sells standard goods at 
standard prices. A discount is sometimes allowed for cash. 



344 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Buying on installments. Methods of payment are dis- 
cussed in Chapter XX. The installment plan is important to 
consider, since it is so common for people of small means. 
How tempting for a young couple, who have no savings, to 
furnish the new home in this way? It is a " gambling on 
futures," however, as much as are some methods in the 
Stock Exchange. If the income stops, because the position 
is lost, or if sickness comes, and the installments cannot be 
paid, the whole outfit may be lost. There have been real 
household tragedies of this kind. The better way is to save 
until a small amount of simple furniture can be purchased 
outright. The installment method is also used by established 
firms of sound reputation to tempt one to buy the latest 
encyclopaedia, or the new musical instrument, or some other 
much-desired possession. This is safe if one is absolutely 
sure of a fixed future income ; but here again it is better to 
save first and buy outright. You may say that the install- 
ment plan gives the use of the encyclopaedia at once, and 
this is true. But if you have the saving habit, there will 
already be a fund on which to draw. 

The ethics of shopping. There is no greater test of good 
breeding and kindness than the tour of a crowded shop; 
and sometimes the silken thread is strained to the snapping 
point. Remember that tired human beings are at the counter. 

Time your shopping that you may not help to crowd busi- 
ness at the closing hour. If the shop closes at five, leave 
several minutes before the hour. As a matter of fact it is 
only to the shopper that the shop closes at the stated hour ; 
some of the hardest work of the day comes after hours. 
Avoid shopping at the luncheon hour, and on Saturday after- 
noon at the time of the week when the salespeople are most 
tired. This is also a hard time for delivery men and boys. 
Consult here the pamphlets of the Consumers' League. 



HOW TO BUY 345 

In times of stress, the shopkeeper asks you to carry small 
bundles home with you, and this you should cheerfully do. 
Some women carry the C.O.D. privilege to an extreme, or- 
dering in this way with the intention of sending certain 
articles back, thus creating much unnecessary labor. 

Purchasing of clothing and household textiles. Experi- 
ence is a good teacher, but knowledge so gained is. often paid 
for at high price. It seems an easier way, with much saving 
of time, money, and energy, for girls to learn beforehand 
what to guard against in purchasing their household textiles 
for both clothing and furnishings. Our great-grandmothers 
were sure their household textiles would wear, for they fol- 
lowed every step of their manufacture and knew they were 
durable and honest. Conditions changed with the factory 
system of manufacture, and to-day women know very little, 
about textile fabrics or the making of garments. This 
ignorance of manufacturing processes results in the increased 
cost of living by the wasteful expenditures made for house- 
hold textiles. Women rely on the information given by 
clerks in stores, often to their sad disadvantage. As we have 
learned, about 15 to 20 per cent of the family income is usu- 
ally spent on clothing and household furnishings for a family 
of four. Is it not necessary then that girls should learn to 
make the dollars earned buy just as much as possible? 

There is need of a pure textile law in order that the adul- 
terations of textiles may be defined. Some of us cannot 
afford to buy pure linen or all wool, but we do wish to know 
the percentage of adulterant in order that we may judge 
whether the materials will meet our needs. It is beyond the 
power of women now to control the making of fabrics, and 
the government, therefore, must help to maintain standards 
and proper supervision of textile labeling. Women can, 
however, study this problem, and with a knowledge of the 



346 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

manufacture and composition of textiles will come the powei 
to choose wisely, for manufacturers have been able to per- 
petuate these frauds chiefly because of ignorance. (See the 
companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing/') 

Some things to remember in purchasing household linens. 

1. Design is important. French designs are the most beautiful 
in damasks? Scotch and Irish are good, and German patterns per- 
haps the least attractive. Weave often affects the wearing quality 
of linen as well as the appearance. The satin stripes and long 
threads on surface are apt to wear off quickly and they are some- 
times introduced to cover defects beneath. They cannot stand 
heavy ironing as the closer, more even, weaves. 

2. Linen is sometimes adulterated with cotton; if bought as 
union goods one may expect it. If bought for pure linen, ravel the 
material and untwist warp and woof threads. Do the threads 
appear long and lustrous ? The round threads are best. If cotton 
has been used, the ends will fly apart and fuzz, if linen they will 
appear more parallel and pointed at the ends when separated. 
The cheaper " all linens " are sometimes made from the tow or 
short refuse. If the fiber is short, it will not last as well as the long. 
Moistening with the finger was an old-fashioned test. A better 
one is to use a drop of olive oil. This test must be made at home. 
Water spreads more rapidly on linen than on cotton. The oil 
makes the linen fibers more translucent than cotton. 

3. Cost is a guide. Linen is expensive. Is the price that 
which should insure a good article ? If cheap, beware. 

4. Feel the cloth. Is it cold and does it feel rather heavy when 
crushed in the hand? Many buyers in department stores judge 
by weight. In purchasing table linen less than 4 oz. to the square 
yard is not worth buying. Above that it improves. Reliable 
firms will tell the weight. Custom house inspectors judge by the 
picks or throws of woof to the inch. 

5. Notice the finish. Is it full of starch and sizing which can 
be picked off? If so, in washing that will all disappear, leaving a 
loosely woven instead of a smooth satiny surface. Calendering 
and beetling make the material smooth and lustrous and reduce 
the thickness. Do not be deceived. It is better to buy a soft 
linen than one stiff with starch which will crack. 



HOW TO BUY 347 

6. In buying table linen the goods received in December and 
January are apt to be the bleach of the previous summer. Remem- 
ber that poor bleaching affects the wearing quality. One can 
sometimes tell by tearing a sample. 

For quality, beauty, and variety of patterns, Scotch, French, and 
Irish linens are the best. German damask is excellent. The 
unbleached will wear much longer, is less expensive, and is bought 
by many housewives and bleached as used. 

Damask by the yard for tablecloths is slightly cheaper. Table- 
cloths from 2| to 3 yards are good size for a medium family of five 
or six. One dollar a yard is a fair price for everyday linen. The 
cloth should about equal 1 dozen napkins in cost, and a cloth will 
usually wear as long as 1 \ to 2 dozen napkins. Napkins come in 
three sizes, f , 17-22 inches ; f , 23-27. inches ; |, 29-31 inches. 

7. For family towels, huckaback is the most serviceable, 
although damask is used a great deal (see Fig. 78). Linen 
towels vary in price from three dollars a dozen up, according to 
size and quality. Dish towels of linen crash are very serviceable. 

8. Bedding. Sheets can be purchased ready made in linen 
or cotton in various sizes. If they are to be made at home, buy 
sheeting that can be obtained for single, two thirds, or full-sized 
bed. If cotton, buy in bleached or unbleached condition. Purchase 
sheets which are long enough to fold over at the top and protect 
the blankets. There are several good brands of cotton sheeting. 
" Fruit of the Loom " is one of the best known. 

Tubing for pillow cases may also be bought. It has no seams, 
and comes in several widths. 

9. It is better to purchase a certain amount of new linen annually 
and gradually supplement that worn than to wait and have all 
wear out at once. 

Some things to remember in purchasing silk. 

1. That pure silk is seldom manufactured. It is nearly always 
weighted, and a large proportion of weighting is to be guarded 
against, as it weakens the wearing quality. Up to 30 per cent is 
not harmful and helps the silk to take the dye. The fact that it is 
heavy in the hand does not always mean that it is a good piece of 
material and will wear well the weight may be due to artificial 
" weighting " and not silk. Choose rather a softer pliable silk. 



348 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 




HOW TO BUY 349 

2. Try the test for strength with the thumb (see *' Shelter and 
Clothing," page 199) to see if the warp and woof threads are equally 
strong, or stronger one way than the other. If the latter, it will 
not wear well. 

3. Fray out the threads. Do they break easily? If so, the silk 
is not of good quality. If the warp threads are weak, the silk will 
split across, if the woof is weak, the silk dress will go in ribbons. 

4. If you have time before purchasing, test a sample of silk by 
burning. Place in a porcelain dish and heat gently for thirty 
minutes. The silk will vanish and the weighting remain. 

Burn the threads to see if there is cotton in warp or woof. Burn 
end of sample. If it is the same shape after burned, it is probably 
weighted. 

5. Close weaves wear better than more loosely woven ones and 
soft silks better than stiff. Guard against buying soft silks, how- 
ever, that are so woven as to pull in the seams when worn. 

6. Are you buying material made of reeled or spun silk? Bar- 
gains are seldom found at silk sales. Should you expect to find 
pure silk at 50 or 60 cents a yard or as many yards of silk thread 
B as A on a spool? Remember that the demand for a cheap 
product means the production of cheap products. Wear something 
else rather than cheap silks. 

7. Is the silk adulterated with mercerized cotton or artificial 
silk? Try the tests. (See " Shelter and Clothing," page 196.) 

Some things to remember in purchasing wool. 

1. Wool mixed with cotton makes a cheaper fabric and should 
not be sold for all wool. It wears well, but is not as warm as all 
wool. Garments made of it do not keep their shape as well. Wool- 
ens are often adulterated in felting. Pull the closely woven fabric 
apart and untwist the fibers to see if cotton is present. 

2. The burning test will help in deciding on the composition. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," page 198.) 

3. A good woolen or worsted fabric can always be remade. 
The inexpensive is not cheap unless you wish something which costs 
little but does not look well or wear well. One should not expect 
to get blankets of all wool for two dollars a pair. They cost five or 
six. 

4. Shoddy is one kind of recovered wool and is used to cheapen 



350 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 
\^ 

cost of all-wool material. It can be detected because of shortness 
of the staple of wool, but when mixed is difficult to see. 

5. The weave of material affects the wearing quality. A close 
twill weave is more durable than a basket weave. 

Some things to remember about color. 

1. Blue. Dark blue in woolen material or gingham usually 
fades little. Light blue is not as durable in color. 

2. Red. Woolen material of this color wears well and usually 
fades little. Red cotton when washed looks less brilliant. It 
soon fades by washing. 

3. Black and gray. . Woolen materials of gray, white, and black 
or in combination are generally satisfactory. Cotton materials of 
gray or black are apt to show starch in washing. 

4. Lavender, This is a poor color to buy. It fades easily in 
cotton goods. 

5. Pink. Fades with washing. If a deep shade be bought it 
may be satisfactory. 

6. Green. Usually very unsatisfactory. In good high priced 
ginghams it may not fade, but in cheap ones it is apt to turn yellow. 

7. Brown. Good usually in ginghams, but likely to fade in 
woolen materials. 

8. See chapters on costume design and dressmaking in " Shelter 
and Clothing," for suggestions in relation to colors one should wear. 

The above brief suggestions must be considered in the light of 
the knowledge gained from the study of the chapters on textiles 
in the companion volume, " Shelter and Clothing." 

In purchasing any materials for clothing or household 
furnishings, remember that demand causes production and 
those who are intelligent will make the right demands in the 
right places. Insist on the honest labeling of goods and 
demand that for which you pay. Why should cotton manu- 
facturers label handkerchiefs which are cotton " pure linen," 
and sell them at ten cents? We too should know linen can- 
not be bought at that price. The United States government 
employs experts to examine the standards of textiles used in 
making army, navy, and other uniforms, and will accept only 



HOW TO BUY 351 

those materials from the contracting manufacturers which 
stand their tests. If a fuller discussion of the buying of 
textile materials is desired, see Woolman and McGowan's 
" Textiles/' particularly the chapters on consumer's judgment 
of textiles, on social and economic conditions, and on clothing 
budgets.

CHAPTER XXII 
HOUSEWIFERY 

THIS old-fashioned word is used here to include the methods 
and processes connected with the actual work of the house, 
excepting the cookery, sewing, and laundering, which have 
fuller treatment elsewhere. This department of household 
management is a combination of sanitation and the economics 
of labor. 

Order in place. Keep articles of a kind together con- 
veniently arranged in places set apart for them, these places 
to be easily accessible. Make an inventory of household 
goods in a card file, household linen, personal apparel, 
including lists of clothing put away for summer or winter, 
dishes, and valuables. Each housekeeper must make a 
scheme that suits her own needs, but a few suggestions may 
be helpful. 

Keep bed linen and towels, piled preferably on shelves, near bed- 
rooms and bathrooms, marked and numbered. Put the clean 
underneath when they come from the laundry. 

Clothing should be kept in an orderly way by each member of 
the family. Winter clothing and furs should be cleansed for putting 
away, protected from moths by wrapping in paper, hanging in tar 
bags, putting in cedar chests, or in trunks with some strong odored 
substances, moth balls or cedar oil. Camphor is too expensive. 
Summer clothing should be washed and put away unstarched and 
unironed. 

Dishes and silver should be carefully arranged in very definite 
places, and counted often enough to keep account of breakage and 
loss.

Brooms, brushes, dusters, and cleansing materials should have a 
place of their own, well ventilated when possible, and all articles 
put away clean. 

Order in work and division of labor. This depends so 
largely upon the number of workers, and upon the equip- 
ment of the house that no definite plan can be made for all. 
The question must be differently answered for the woman 
who has a helper one day a week, or with one or two, or with 
a large staff of workers. However, there should be some 
definite plan for the days of the week and the hours of the 
day, and some division of work among the members of the 
family or between the family and paid helpers. The young 
people of the family should each have some regular piece 
of work, at least in their own rooms ; and the paid helpers 
should have a definite plan given them, including some hours 
to themselves, as regular as possible. There are emergen- 
cies that upset even the most perfect system, and these 
must be met as they come, but a fair amount of work at 
regular times should be the system. 

11 Domestic service " is too large a social and economic 
problem to discuss at length here. Miss Jane Addams calls 
it " belated industry," meaning that in domestic work we 
are far behind the productive industries of commerce in 
organization. We are trying experiments in putting work 
out, and having helpers come in, and in time we may bring 
order out of chaos when employers and employees are all 
properly trained and have the right relation to each other. 

Processes of housewifery. Good working equipment, 
including labor-saving apparatus, is an essential; and we 
must have knowledge of the effect of different cleansing 
materials on fabrics, wood, paint, glass, and metal. 

Equipment. Brooms should be made of pliable straw 
(broom corn), be evenly made, with a light and comfortable 
handle. 



HOUSEWIFERY 355 

Brushes may include the whisk broom, soft brush of 
bristles both short and long handled for floors, a long handled 
brush of wool or soft material for walls, ceilings, and cornices, 
a soft brush for furniture, a thin brush for radiators, a silver 
brush, and stiff scrubbing brush. The variety of brushes at 
a furnishing shop is very large, and interesting to study. It 
is economy to buy good quality when you can, and if cleaned 
and not abused they last a long time. Wash the brushes 
in soapsuds and water, drain and dry before putting away. 
A bamboo beater is convenient. The dustpan should have a 
narrow cover at the handle side, and a strong handle. 

Carpet sweepers prevent dust from flying and are easy to 
use, but inclined to wear off the pile of the carpet. 

Vacuum cleaners are a necessity in crowded city quarters, 
where we cannot beat and shake dusty carpets and rugs out 
of windows, on the roof, or in the street, on account of our 
neighbors. That we cannot all have them does not make 
them less necessary. While they may involve no less mus- 
cular exertion they remove dust and old dirt in a remarkable 
way from fabrics, and are very useful for taking dirt from 
cracks in the floor and woodwork and from upholstered fur- 
niture. The principle of operation differs with different 
makes, and some are less effective than others, but there are 
several patterns that do good work and are not expensive. 
Experiment with one at the first opportunity. A room 
cleaned in this way is markedly different in odor from a room 
that has been swept with a broom, even when this is well done. 

A good vacuum cleaner must have an air conveying sys- 
tem, a separator or other means of disposal of the material 
picked up, and a vacuum producer. They may be divided, 
according to the method employed, into those worked by 
bellows, by fan, by rotary pump and piston pump. This is 
a problem to take to the class in physics. 



356 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Cleaning cloths. Have a good supply of cheesecloth 
dusters, and heavier cloth for work on the floors. A sponge 
and chamois are useful. The mop, which is a cloth or fiber 
fabric on a handle, is something that we ought to banish 
when we can, for it is hard to keep clean, and is a trap for 
bacteria. A substitute for the common mop is a long handle 
with a cross bar covered with corrugated rubber, which is 
held down on the cloth, and rubbed back and forth but not 
fastened to the cloth. Avoid the use of linty old cloths, 
because the thread and lint clog the traps and drains. 

Cleaning cloths should be boiled in strong soap suds, 
rinsed, and thoroughly dried before putting away. This is 
a difficult rule to enforce, for it is a temptation to tuck 
such things away where they will not show. Watch this 
matter as you do the garbage pail. When a cloth is too 
dirty to wash clean, burn it or send it away with paper 
refuse. 

Cleaning materials. Air, sunshine, and water are the 
great purifiers, plus muscular energy or the power of ma- 
chinery, but we frequently use chemical aids. These should 
all be kept in stock. 

Soaps and alkalies. White and yellow soap, some washing 
powder, sal soda, caustic soda, household ammonia. Buy these in 
quantities if you have room to store them, and if they will not be 
used too lavishly because the supply is large. The soap is not much 
cheaper by the box, but it hardens with age, and then it wastes 
less rapidly when used. 

Oils and polishes. Crude oil, kerosene, a mixture of linseed 
oil, vinegar, and turpentine, one part each, cottonseed oil, alcohol. 

Acids. A solution of oxalic acid marked poison. Vinegar is 
on hand among kitchen supplies. 

Gritty substances. Rotten stone, whiting, some gritty soap of a 
kind that does not scratch, a gritty powder, or fine sand for coarse 
work. 

Disinfectant and deodorizers. A weak solution of carbolic acid 



HOUSEWIFERY 357 

marked poison, chloride of lime, or some reliable preparation 1 
(though these are rather expensive), rock salt, and coarse common 
salt. 

Methods of cleaning. We must first consider what the 
substance is that has to be removed. The fabrics and up- 
holstery used in furnishing catch dust which contains lint, 
grit, organic material from our bodies, and bacteria. Fab- 
rics also become spotted (see next chapter). The walls 
and ceilings, floors and cracks, catch dust. All wood and 
glass surfaces become soiled from the touch of even clean 
fingers, and the moisture of the air mixed with dust dulls 
them. Metal surfaces oxidize, and this oxidized layer must 
be rubbed off. 

To clean fabrics. If you live in a suburb or in the country, 
brush, shake, and beat articles to be cleaned out of doors, noticing 
the way of the wind that the dust may not be carried back into the 
house. 

To cleanse a rug, spread it on the grass, rub with a medium 
stiff brush with white soap solution on the wrong side, turn it over, 
and rinse with water from the hose ; or better still, tack it by two 
corners to a wooden wall, and then wash with hose. The city 
dweller must resort to the vacuum cleaner, or rely upon a cleaning 
establishment. The other alternative is to shake out the dust in 
the room, remove each article as it is cleaned, let the dust settle, 
and take it out as well as it can be. One apartment dweller heard 
this remark rise from the window below her: " Shut the window 
quick. Those dirty people upstairs are brushing a rug out the 
window ! " 

Painted surfaces and woodwork should be wiped off with a soft 
cloth wrung out of tepid water. A small amount of neutral white 
soap solution in the water can be used for paint if it is greasy, but 
alkalies are ruinous. 

A highly polished surface (piano) is cleaned by washing with 

1 Some of the widely advertised disinfectants are rather ineffective. 
Those interested should look up the tests of commercial disinfectants pub- 
lished from time to time by the United States Public Health Service. 



358 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

a sponge and tepid water, and rubbing until dry with a wet chamois 
wrung out of cold water. This method was learned from a piano 
polisher, and it works excellently. A dry chamois streaks the 
surface. 

The wood of furniture is kept clean by rubbing with a soft dry 
cloth, but once in a while needs cleaning with crude oil or the mix- 
ture of oil, turpentine, and vinegar. Bureau drawers need watch- 
ing for finger marks. 

Glass is best cleaned by rubbing on a mixture of whiting and 
water. Leave it to dry and rub off with a dry cloth. A fine gritty 
soap comes for this purpose. Ammonia and water and a soft 
cloth work well, the success depending upon the final polishing. 
Very soft tissue paper is satisfactory for polishing. 

Marble, porcelain, and enamel need little more than white soap 
suds, rinsed off and the surface dried. If spotted, use the finest 
kind of metal soap. 

Metals. Fine silver and plated ware should be kept polished 
by the daily careful washing, rinsing in hot water. Silver will 
spot and tarnish. Use whiting and alcohol, let it dry on, and rub 
off with a clean cloth or chamois. 

The silver powders sold at the silversmith's are very good, but 
the patent powders and liquids should not be used, as they remove 
too much of the silver. 

Brass and copper are polished with rotten stone and oil. If 
the metal is spotted, use oxalic acid solution with the rotten stone. 
After rubbing well, the metal should be washed off in hot soap suds 
and finished with a dry cloth. 

Nickel plate keeps bright if kept clean by daily dry rubbing. 

Care of rooms. The bedroom. The daily care includes 
airing the room and its closets, airing and making the bed, 
dusting, removing lint and threads from the floor, and re- 
moving slops and bringing fresh water if bathing apparatus 
is in the room. 

To make the bed. The amount of airing of the bedclothes 
depends somewhat upon the weather ; bed linen absorbs too much 
damp if placed by the window on a rainy or foggy day. Pull back 
the bedclothes and hang them over a chair set front to the foot of 



HOUSEWIFERY 359 

the bed, seeing that the bedclothes do not drag on the floor. On a 
bright, fresh day remove all the clothes and hang them singly near 
the window. If there is a screen in the room, this is convenient for 
this purpose. The blankets should be hung out on the line once in 
a while, and washed twice a year. One important point in the 
cleanliness of the bed is a pad or thick cloth placed on the mat- 
tress under the sheet. The mattress should be sunned and aired 
often, and beaten or cleaned with the vacuum cleaner. 

To make the bed, place the cover on the mattress, lay the under 
sheet straight, tuck in firmly at top and bottom, and fold the sides 
under straight, making angles at the corners. Put each piece on 
separately, turning the upper sheet down over the others. The 
cover is sometimes placed over all, and a strip to match over the 
pillows. 

Care of the washstand. This is all important, and cannot be 
neglected a day, without causing an unpleasant odor. The jars 
containing slops should be rinsed in cold water, washed out in warm 
soap suds, dried, and aired. If the ware is china, hot water may 
crackle the glaze, and then it is impossible to remove odors. Wash 
and dry all the small articles and wipe out and refill the water 
pitcher. 

Care of the bedroom at night. Fold back, or remove the covers, 
and lay the bedclothes partly back. See that drinking water 
is in the room, and lighting conveniences. 

The living room, dining room, and halls. The daily 
care consists in setting furniture and such small articles as 
the pictures and ornaments straight, removing lint and dust 
from the floor, dusting wherever needed. 

The weekly cleaning of all rooms. Whether a thorough 
cleaning is needed weekly, depends upon the situation of the 
house, and the number of people who use the rooms. The 
rooms in a country house set in wide green spaces do not need 
cleaning so often as those of a city house. 

General order for all rooms. Dust all small articles, place 
them together and cover them. Dust and clean off furniture and 
take the lighter pieces from the room. Cover what remains. Clean 



360 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

the textile fabrics in the best way available. Brush the walls, 
with a special brush, or soft cloth on a broom. Dust and cover 
pictures. Brush the rugs, or use vacuum cleaner. If the floor is* 
hardwood, brush it with a soft brush, taking long, steady strokes 
from corner and sides to center. Take up dust in pan, and carry 
away to burn, or put in dust can at once. Wipe the floor with moist 
cloth, or with oiled cloth. 

If there is a carpet and a broom is to be used, scatter pieces of 
wet paper over it, moisten the broom, and sweep as directed for 
brushing, using steady strokes and not allowing the dust to fly. 
The broom should be washed and dried. If dust flies, allow it 
time to settle. Dust the surfaces left exposed. Wipe off the wood- 
work if necessary, remove covers, and replace all articles. To have 
the room perfectly clean, windows should be washed, but if this is 
not convenient at the time, or the weather is bad, rub them and 
dust the sashes. Wash mirrors and the glass of pictures. This 
means much labor, and some people cannot accomplish it every 
week ; and different rooms should have different cleaning days. But 
such thorough cleaning occasionally is necessary for keeping all 
articles in good condition and also for the health of the family. 

The old-fashioned yearly house cleaning seems hardly necessary 
if cleaning is well done through the year, but in both fall and spring 
some extra freshening may be necessary in the way of thorough 
cleansing of textiles and furniture. All closets should have every- 
thing removed from them and the whole closet cleansed. Drawers 
should come out, be emptied, washed and aired, and fresh white 
or brown paper put in all. 

The bathroom and toilet. This needs very particular 
care, no matter what the type may be. All drains and traps 
should be flushed daily, and a solution of caustic soda put 
down weekly. If there is an odor about the water closet, 
try salt first, and then some chloride preparation. The basin, 
the tub, and the seat and basin of the toilet should be thor- 
oughly washed daily. When the bathroom is used by more 
than one person, all should be taught to leave all the toilet 
equipment perfectly clean. If the toilet is not of the water- 
closet type, even greater care should be taken. Everything 



HOUSEWIFERY 361 

must be kept scrubbed clean, and chloride of lime should 
be put down daily, if there is not a removable pail with earth. 
(See " Shelter and Clothing," p. 48.) 

Care of lamps. If kerosene is used, this is an important 
feature of housework. 

Have a tray for holding necessary articles, soft cloth, paper, 
strong, sharp scissors, lamp chimney brush. When the lamp is to 
be cleaned, set it upon this tray. Take off all the easily removable 
parts. Fill the lamp through a funnel, and do not let the kerosene 
run over. Wipe off the charred wick with paper, and wipe the 
burner. Wash off the lamp in warm soap suds, wash and polish 
the chimney and shade, and replace. If you cannot get rid of odor, 
take the burner apart, boil it in a solution of washing soda, and put 
in a new wick. Cleaning a lamp is not nearly so disagreeable as 
many people think it, when it is done with good will. To shirk it 
means an unpleasant odor in the room and a poor light. Always 
fill the lamp in the daytime and keep it away from the fire. 

Household insects. Keep out flies and mosquitoes by 
screens, but see first that your premises are clean, and do 
what you can in the whole neighborhood. 

Flies breed in dirty stables and mosquitoes in standing water. 
The stables must be cleaned and kept so, and water drained off or 
kerosene put upon it. Mosquitoes will breed in water in an empty 
milk bottle or old tomato can. If flies enter the house, kill them in 
some way. Wire or net fly killers cost only ten cents, and do 
good work. If the flies are very numerous, catch them in wire traps, 
or burn pyrethrum powder in the room. At night when they are 
on the ceiling, catch them in a glass of hot water and soap, not 
quite full, by holding the glass under the fly and gently knocking 
the glass against the ceiling. If the ceiling is high, tack an empty 
can on the end of an old broom stick and set the glass in that. 

Clothing moths are kept out by precautions already mentioned. 

If bed bugs appear, go over the bed with great care and examine 
the bedstead. Wash it off with kerosene, putting this well into 
the cracks. A single insect may be brought in on the clothing. If 
they continue to appear, all wall paper should be removed, wood- 



362 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

work varnished or painted. It may be necessary to resort to fumi- 
gation, but this should be done by an expert. Croton or water 
bugs are difficult to destroy, if they are once in a house. No gar- 
bage should be left about, to attract them at night. There are 
powders that drive them x away, and an'other remedy is sulphur 
paste, which comes for the purpose, and which may be spread on 
slices of potato. The U. S. Department of Agriculture issues free 
bulletins on the suppression of household insects. 

Precautions against fire. So many disastrous fires occur 
as a result of a careless act that we need to train ourselves 
in caution. The matches used should be of the safety type. 
They should be blown out, never shaken, and never thrown 
into a basket of papers. When matches are used, always 
have a small fire-proof receptacle in each room. Smokers 
are often careless in regard to their matches, cigars, and pipes. 
Be careful in summer to see that a breeze cannot blow some 
light curtain over a candle or lamp. 

If a kettle of fat catches fire, pour on sand, but never water. 
As a general rule, extinguish a flame by covering it rather than by 
throwing on water. 

If clothing catches on fire, wrap a rug or any large woolen article 
tightly around the body. To rush into the air is fatal. 

If a towel or apron catches fire, roll it up quickly before the blaze 
spreads. This can be done without injury to the hands. 

Small fire extinguishers are not expensive. Most kinds contain 
a solution of soda and a bottle of sulphuric acid which mix when the 
extinguisher is inverted, and throw out a stream of water charged 
with gas from a small hose. This works well just as a fire starts. Ex- 
tinguishers arranged to throw a stream of carbon tetrachloride are 
also on the market. 

Repairs. Too often in planning the budget, and the 
daily work, the housekeeper forgets to allow for the constant 
wear and tear on the house itself, and its furnishings ; but 
to preserve the beauty and usefulness of both the house and 
furniture, as much thought and time are necessary as for the 



HOUSEWIFERY 363 

repair of clothing. In addition to the care and cleaning, 
there must be a constant attention to small repairs. 

Inspecting and reporting. Have a series of cards in the card 
file, or pages in the notebook, where needed repairs may be jotted 
down. Have a regular time for looking over different parts of the 
house ; and give a brief daily look as you pass from room to room. 
Each member of the family should be asked to report whatever goes 
wrong in his province, a leaky faucet, a squeaky door, or broken 
castor, a tear in a curtain, a shade roller that does not work. 

For large repairs, like a leak in the water or waste system or 
shingle on a roof, a trained worker is needed ; but for small repairs 
a special worker from outside is too expensive, and there needs to 
be a handy person in the house, who can put in a screw, and use a 
monkey wrench, touch up the paint or varnish, or mend the wall 
paper. It is pleasant work, and in these days when schools teach so 
much handicraft, there should be some one in the family glad to 
do it. 

A repair outfit. Have a shelf somewhere for the repair "kit." 
Look at the woodwork of your house, and see what is needed ; 
whether paint, or varnish, an oil mixture or stain, or all of them. 
Have on hand a small can of each, and bottles of alcohol, turpentine, 
and glue. Two or three paint brushes of good quality and of dif- 
ferent sizes are needed. Keep a bundle of wall paper including 
pieces of all the patterns on the walls. A box of tools is needed, 
including a hammer, gimlet, screw driver, monkey wrench, a sharp 
knife, with boxes of nails and screws of mixed kinds and sizes such 
as may be found at any hardware store.

CHAPTER XXIII 
LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 

" WASHING is a necessity, ironing a luxury." This terse 
sentence expresses very clearly the relative value of the two 
large divisions of the laundering process. The thorough 
washing of clothing is a most important branch of household 
sanitation, upon which the health of the family and of the 
whole community depends, for disease is communicable by 
means of soiled garments and those that are imperfectly 
cleansed in unsanitary houses and possibly in commercial 
laundries. The ideal city will have many large and spot- 
lessly clean laundries, where skilled labor intelligently di- 
rected will insure clothing as clean as it can possibly be made. 

There is an aesthetic element in laundering as well, for good 
washing methods give a tinted white to fabrics that it is a 
pleasure to see, and ironing makes a smoothness that is 
pleasant to the touch, and brings out beauty of design, as 
in damasks and embroideries. There is an economic feature, 
too, in that poor and rough methods of work in both washing 
and ironing injure fabrics and shorten their term of usable- 
ness. 

" Washing Day " has an ill repute that it does not deserve, 
for laundering is a science and an art that it is a pleasure to 
practice, if one has skill. Make it one of the household arts 
which you must carefully study, and you will find it pleasur- 
able as well as necessary. 

Soil in garments. The dust and dirt of the street and 
house that soil our garments contain inorganic particles of 

365 



366 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

earth, lint from textiles, organic matter from animals and 
human beings, and also bacteria. The material from our 
bodies consists of particles of skin, skin secretions, and bac- 
teria, which are collected in underwear and bed linen and 
towels. Spots of grease and stains may fall upon our outer 
clothing, and fruit stains affect table linen in particular. 

Cleansing agents. Water is the great cleanser, and if 
it is not available in abundance and used freely, the washing 
is a failure. All other agents are merely aids to the water 
or substitutes for it. In primitive outdoor methods, still 
largely used in some countries, the flowing water is the only 
agent, and yet the result is fairly good. We aid the process 
by the use of soap or washing powders or ammonia. 

The air and sun are also purifiers, and clothing should be 
exposed to their action for drying whenever possible. There 
is a sweetness in air and sun-dried clothing that no artificial 
drier seems to give. Probably there takes place some oxi- 
dation of impurities present in very small amount and, more- 
over, any bacteria still clinging to the fabric may be killed 
by the sun's rays. Heat is a purifier, oily substances being 
more readily removed by hot water and soap than by cold ; 
and the boiling temperature of water renders bacteria and 
organic matter harmless. 

Some mechanical action that forces water through the 
fabric is necessary, and the method of accomplishing this is 
one of the important problems in laundering. We seek a 
method that will be thorough, that will not injure the fabric, 
and that will economize the muscular energy of the worker. 
Beating, pounding, and rubbing are the old methods, the 
use of a machine the new, and that is the best machine that 
meets all the requirements of the properly conducted washing 
process as described below. 

The water should be soft and clean. Rain water is a per- 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 367 

fectly soft water and excellent for laundering if the cistern 
is kept clean, and free from the dust of the roof. Lake, 
river, and well water are sometimes soft. Strainers may be 
used on the faucets if at any time the water from these 
sources becomes muddy. (See Chapter V for discussion of 
soft and hard water.) 

Hard water prevents the soap from lathering, and this 
must be counteracted for laundering. Temporary hardness 
is removed by boiling. Permanent hardness is not affected 
by boiling and can be overcome only by the addition of some 
substance like ammonia, borax, or soda. Only enough of 
these should be used to allow the soap to do its work, since 
they may injure fabric and the skin of the worker. 

Soap is the most useful of the cleansing agents added to 
water. It may have been accidentally made in the first 
place by some housewife who put a greasy pot to soak with 
a solution of lye made from the ashes of her hearth fire. Heat 
and alkali break up the fat into two parts, glycerin and a fatty 
acid. The fatty acid combines with the alkali, giving soap, 
and the glycerin remains free. Both animal and vegetable 
fats are used, and different forms of alkali, usually potash or 
caustic soda, the former for soft, the latter for hard, soap. 

In these days soap is much better made in the factory than 
it can be at home. In the factory the alkali is proportioned 
by weight, so that as little free alkali is left as possible. 
Such a soap is called " neutral." Resin is added, in yellow 
laundry soaps, and is supposed to aid in forming suds. When 
there is an excess of resin, as in some cheap soaps, it is hard 
to rinse out and colors the clothes. Borax is sometimes 
added to soap, and is useful when the water is hard, but not 
necessary in soft water. Naphtha or some other petroleum 
oil in soap increases the cleansing property of soap, by dis- 
solving fatty or greasy impurities. 



368 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

A soap solution is essential for use in the boiler and in 
washing machines and is useful for rubbing on spots before 
washing. 

To make soap solution, cut up the soap and dissolve it in hot 
water, one pound soap to one gallon of water. It should be strong 
enough to jelly when cool, and may be kept in jars ready to use. 
Even more convenient are soap chips which come by the barrel, but 
may be bought at pound rates. 

Bleaching and bluing agents. The sun, as it bleaches 
white fabrics, may be counted in this group. Chemical 
bleaches are used to whiten clothes, but should not be re- 
sorted to unless clothes are yellow from poor washing, as in 
the end they weaken the fabric. Commercial laundries 
sometimes use an excess of acid for this purpose. Cream of 
tartar is a harmless bleach. Javelle water is another house- 
hold bleach, chloride of lime being the bleaching substance. 
This is also a good disinfectant. 

To use cream of tartar. Dissolve cream of tartar in hot water, 

1 teaspoonful to each quart. After the yellowed fabrics have been 
thoroughly washed and rinsed, lay them overnight in a solution 
of this strength, rinse, blue, and dry in the morning. 

Javelle water. | pound chloride of lime, 1 pound sal soda, 

2 quarts of cold water. Dissolve the chloride in half the water 
cold, and the sal soda in the other half boiling. Stir together 
thoroughly, allow the mixture to stand several hours, pour off the 
clear water with care, and bottle it. Use a tablespoonful of the 
solution to a gallon of water, and heat the yellow fabric in this 
mixture after thorough washing, for half an hour, not allowing the 
temperature to rise above 100 F. Rinse very thoroughly before 
bluing and drying. 

Bluing is used to neutralize the slightly yellowish tint of 
the fabric, when it cannot be completely bleached. 

Ultramarine blue is sold in small balls and cakes. 

Aniline blue is a strong color, and in a very dilute solution gives 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 369 

a pleasing pearly tint to the fabric, especially when the violet tint 
is used. Mix an ounce of the blue with one gallon water, and bottle 
for use. 

Prussian blue is to be avoided, since it is a salt of iron, and often 
yellows or spots the clothes. It is usually sold in liquid form. To 
test, mix the liquid blue with a strong solution of washing soda and 
heat. If the mixture turns red, and there is a reddish precipitate, 
the blue is this salt of iron. 

Starch is used to fill the interstices of fabrics and give a 
smoothness and stiffness to the cloth that prevents the 
rumpling of garments. Both wheat and cornstarch are used 
for laundry purposes when only the natural starches are 
available, the wheat starch being better for home laundering, 
as the cornstarch gives a quality that is too stiff and crack- 
ling. Recently, however, the manufacturers have learned 
to make " thin boiling " starches from corn and have placed 
on the market a variety of such modifications of cornstarch 
for laundry use. Rice starch or " rice water " is used for 
very thin muslins. 

To make starch. For method of making, see starch experiments, 
Chapter VIII. The starch must be perfectly smooth, and should be 
stirred while it is boiling for a few minutes, and strained. 
Proportions. 

1. For lingerie, 1 teaspoonful of starch to 1 quart water. 

2. For medium fabrics, 1| to 3 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart 
water. 

3. For stiff work, 5 tablespoonfuls starch to 1 quart water. 

Ironing. The ironing process is the most difficult art 
in laundering, and requires good tools, practice, and patience. 
In the summer it is an exhausting labor unless an electric 
or gas iron is available. Much energy may be saved in hot 
weather by omitting the ironing of certain articles. Dish 
towels, even toilet towels, and soft underwear may be 
stretched and folded, and are perfectly comfortable to use. 
2s 



370 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

Some women who do their own work even fold sheets and 
pillow cases without ironing. 

The smoothing of the fabric is accomplished by heated 
irons, or by pressing between rollers in a mangle. 

To summarize. The essential steps in laundering are : 
the forcing of clear water through the fabric ; loosening of 
the soil and stains by soap and appropriate chemicals, sterili- 
zation by boiling temperature, drying and sweetening in the 
air if possible. The less essential are bluing, starching, and 
in some cases ironing. 

Laundry equipment. We are beginning to realize that a 
separate room for laundering purposes is an essential in a 
well-equipped home. Such a laundry will be light and well 
ventilated, will have washable floors, walls, and ceilings, 
running water and, hot water supply, sanitary tubs and con- 
veniences in the shape of machinery. We shall not have 
perfect laundries until electric power is available at a fair 
price. Much is said about electricity on the farm, and the 
progressive farmer who has his own engine should not fail 
to use the power for all laundry work. Trolley power should 
be available, and this use of electricity should be made co- 
operative when practicable. In a few communities abroad 
and at home, the power available in a creamery is used for 
laundering purposes as well. 

Where there cannot be a separate laundry, take pains to 
have the equipment as good as space will allow. 

The tubs. If possible, have three tubs, for this makes for econ- 
omy of time. Enameled tubs are the most sanitary, and be sure 
that they are white. You cannot tell whether or not the clothes 
are clean and blued to the proper tint in a buff- tinted tub, which 
you may be tempted to buy because it is cheaper. 

Round portable tubs, to be set upon a bench, should be of gal- 
vanized iron, which is sanitary and light. Wooden tubs are things 
of the past, unsanitary and heavy. 



LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 371 

Equipment for forcing water. The rubbing board is the old-time 
method, yet it wears the fabric and wears out the worker, and 
should be used as little as possible. If still considered necessary, 
it should be of glass set in wood. The wooden board is unsanitary 
and the metal board may at any moment develop a tiny crack that 
wilLtear the fabric. 

Fortunately, many women are learning that the washing machine, 
properly used, is a great economy of fabric, time, and strength. 
Many machines are on the market, and we need to discriminate 
and to select the machine constructed to force the water through 
the fabric without injury to the fabric, and with the smallest 
amount of muscular energy and that properly exerted without 
strain. Of course, if machine power is available, the problem is 
easy. These many washers may be classed in four groups. One 
is a revolving arrangement, sometimes consisting of two corrugated 
boards set in the center of a tub of clothes, one objection being that 
the clothes are sometimes torn. Another type has a revolving 
perforated inner cylinder for the clothes, and an outer one for the 
soap and water. This is much more expensive. Still a third rocks 
the clothes in soap and water and is very effective. A fourth type 
makes use of suction. 

The principle of cleansing by pressure and suction is used in 
several machines and hand washers, and these are, on the whole, 
inexpensive and practical for home work. The work is accomplished 
by an inverted cone, pushed down on the clothes, and lifted. Such 
a washer is seen standing on the floor in Fig. 80. The same figure 
also shows another of this type standing on the table, and still ( 
another to be used in the boiler. 

Most of these devices can be used with power. 

The boiler. A portable boiler is convenient. It should be 
made of good quality tin with copper bottom and must be thoroughly 
washed and dried after using. 

The wringer is of great assistance to good work. It should be a 
good machine having hard rubber rollers, ball-bearing action, and 
strong springs at the side. It must be cleaned after using, dried, 
the pressure loosened, and the whole kept covered. 

The drier. If clothesline or heavy wire is used, this must be of 
good quality, and well cared for. The clothesline should be taken 
in after each using. A revolving drier is convenient, and may even 



372 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 




LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 373 

be used in apartment houses. The steam drier has a rack on which 
clothes are hung, and economizes space and time. 

Irons. The hand iron is heated in several different ways. 
The old-fashioned iron heated on the stove, and the electric iron are 
the most satisfactory. In buying hand irons, select those of good 
weight, for this makes the work easier. Three or four will suffice 
for ordinary work, and they should weigh from 4 or 5 to 7 pounds. 
A small pointed iron is necessary for fine work, and for sleeves there 
is a special, narrow iron. The irons must be kept clean, and per- 
fectly dry when not in use. Wax tied in a cloth is a good cleaner, 
and should be at hand during the ironing process. A stand is nec- 
essary on which the iron may rest, and paper or cloth on which 
to rub the iron when it comes from the stove. 

Electric irons are proving very satisfactory, and although the 
first cost is high, they should be used wherever possible. 

The mangle. Small mangles, used either cold or heated, are 
now made for family use, and are great labor savers in flat work. 
Towels and small flat pieces may even be put through the wringer, 
while they are still damp, with very good effect. 

The ironing board. This should be firm, well padded, and 
covered with clean cloth. The cover may be made to tie on so 
that it can be easily changed. Ironing boards should be placed 
in a good light. Boards may be attached to the wall, and these 
have firm support. In a small room, the board can be made to 
turn up. 

Other apparatus. A hamper or bag for soiled clothes, a basket 
for clean, pail and dipper, a clothes stick, a large pan, a small and a 
large saucepan, a teakettle for boiling water, a knife, wooden spoon, 
common spoons and measures, a sprinkler or brush for sprinkling 
clothes, a clotheshorse, clothes hangers for waists and dresses. 
The soiled clothes bag should be washed weekly, and the hamper 
should have a removable lining also for weekly washing. 

Monday and Tuesday are the traditional days for washing 
and ironing, but the woman who does her own work, or per- 
haps has a helper, or one maid, may find it a good plan to do 
no more on Monday than the mending, removing of stains, 
and sorting. This gives time to make the house orderly, 
after Sunday, and to prepare food, some of which may last 



374 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

over the next two days. Some of the clothes may then be 
soaked overnight. 

Order of work. Mending, sorting the clothes, removing 
stains, soaking, washing, boiling, rinsing, bluing, starching, 
drying, sprinkling and rolling, ironing, folding, airing, 
sorting, and distributing. 

Methods. Mending and removing spots from fabrics 
are discussed in " Shelter and Clothing." A few common 
stains are removed as follows : 

Fruit and coffee stains. Hold the spotted fabric tightly over a 
bowl and pour boiling water through it. Of course, remove stains 
at once if possible. 

Peach stains are removed by Javelle water. Apply a few drops 
and pour boiling water through at once. 

Cocoa and chocolate stains are helped by borax, and by soap and 
cold water. 

Ink. Liquid ink removers provided for the library table are 
convenient. Wet the spot, use 1, dry with a blotter, and use 2, 
and rinse at once. The same thing is done by wetting, applying 
an oxalic acid solution first, then Javelle water and rinsing. 

Blood stains are removed by soaking in lukewarm water, and 
washing in a soap solution with a little ammonia and kerosene, or 
with a naphtha soap. 

Sorting. Separate the fabrics, wool from cotton and so on, 
and colored cotton from white ; also separate body linen from bed 
linen and from table linen. 

Soaking. This hastens the process since it loosens dirt, and 
one laboratory experiment seemed to show that soaked clothes are 
freer from bacteria, than those that are not. 

Shrinkable fabrics cannot be soaked. Body and table linen 
should be soaked separately. The water should be cold, softened 
with a little ammonia. 

Washing. Wash woolens and silk underwear first, in warm, 
not hot, soap suds, wring out, rinse, and hang to dry. Use a white, 
neutral soap. Have the same temperature for both washing and 
rinsing. Boiling water shrinks wool, and yellows silk. Hand- 
knit wool, as shawls and jackets, stretch in drying. If dried in a 



, LAUNDERING AND DRY CLEANSING 375 

bag or pillow case, this is partly obviated, or lay them on a pad on 
the table. 

Prepare hot water in the tub, with dissolved soap in it, either for 
handwork or a washer. Wash table linen first, then bed linen and 
towels, and next the body clothes. Soap the articles well, and 
rub or use a washer. It is well to wash handkerchiefs by them- 
selves, boiling in a pail for half an hour. If one of the family has a 
cold or influenza, soak his handkerchiefs in a solution of salt and 
water and perhaps a little bleaching powder before washing and 
boiling. 

Make fresh suds often. This means heavy labor in the case 
of portable tubs, but clothes cannot be cleansed in dirty water. 

Colored cotton and linen articles may be washed last. They 
should be put first into salt and water to set the color, washed in 
tepid water with white soap, rinsed thoroughly and hung in the 
shade, wrong side out. 

Boiling. Boil the washed clothes in soap solution for ten min- 
utes. In case of infectious disease, all the patient's linen should 
be boiled an hour, 1 and of course exposed clothing is kept separate 
through the whole process. 

Rinsing. This must be thorough and two or three waters must 
be used. This is the stage where many laundresses fail. The 
suction washers are very useful here. 

Wringing. This must take place between every two stages of 
the process. 

Bluing. Add the bluing solution to clean water to the desired 
shade, shake each piece, put it through the water, and wring out 
at once. Do not use bluing in excess. 

Starching. Next the fabrics that need a little thin starch may 
be starched. Starch for stiff collars and shirts is rubbed in at the 
time of ironing. 

Drying. Hang out the clothes, having pieces of a kind to- 
gether, and the threads straight. If out of doors, hang in such a 
way that the air will have easy access. 

Take down, when dry, and fold lightly in a basket. 

Sprinkle, roll tightly, and leave them until ironing time. Thin 
fabrics should be very moist, as they dry quickly. 

1 Depending upon the nature of the infection, it may be possible to sub- 
stitute the use of a proper disinfectant, followed by short boiling.

and iron with the long thread of the material. Bring the article 
on the board toward you. Iron first the parts that will wrinkle least, 
such as ruffles and trimming and sleeves. Embroidery and damask 
should be ironed on a very soft material like a Turkish towel, right 
side down. Always iron until the fabric is dry.

All tucks and folds must be carefully straightened, and if 
crooked, they must be made very wet and done over again, 
ironing a waist will you do the sleeve or the body first ? 

Large flat pieces, 
towels, and napkins 
are folded in the iron- 
ing. Doilies and 
centerpieces should 
not be folded. 

Folding is neces- 
sary in order to make 
the garments of con- 
venient shape for put- 
ting away. Figures 
81 and 82 will suggest 
the method for some 
garments. 



Commercial laun- 
dries. The con- 
venience of these 
has been suggested 
already. When we 
can make them all 
sanitary, and when 
methods are used 
that will not injure 
the fabric, we can 
safely put this kind 
of work out of the

house, but at present many commercial laundries are unsan- 
itary and ruin the clothes. 

Cost of laundering. We cannot have good service with- 
out paying for it, and one cause of poor laundry work is the 
public demand for cheap work, and this too has its effect 
upon the laundry worker. The housekeeper often fails to 



378 FOODS AND HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT 

have the laundry ready when the wagon calls, and yet de- 
mands a quick return, which also results in poor work. 

If you have never done any laundering and expect a laun- 
dress to do up fine lingerie at a low rate, it will be a revelation 
to you to attempt to iron a shirt waist or lingerie dress, and 
then decide what remuneration you would yourself like to 
receive. One class of high school girls, after a course of six 
laundry lessons, decided that a dollar a dozen was fair pay 
for ordinary work ! This is an interesting question for class 
and home discussion. 

Dry cleaning. This is accomplished by gasoline, 
naphtha, or benzine, and should not be attempted by the 
city dweller. In the country or suburbs, it should be done 
out of doors, far from any source of fire. Use a basin or tub, 
and immerse the article in the liquid, using as much as if 
water, lifting gently up and down. Rinse in a second por- 
tion. A suction washer may be used with large garments. 
Do not rub the fabric in the liquid. Lift, drain, and hang to 
dry. Keep the can in a safe place, safety being insured by 
coolness. 

Powdered French chalk may be rubbed into delicate silk 
and wool, where there is a grease spot, or an oiliness from 
the skin. Leave for twenty-four hours, then shake, and 
brush out. 

Ether and chalk may be used, but the ether affects some 
people unpleasantly, and dissolves out some delicate colors. 
Meal may also be used for cleaning wool, especially knitted 
fabrics, but it is difficult to shake out, and it needs blowing 
out on the clothesline. 



Laboratory management. A few lessons can be given in laundering where 
there is no complete equipment. Dish towels, doilies, and napkins can at 
least be washed in dishpans in the school kitchen, and a few irons provided. 
A few such lessons are helpful at least in developing an appreciation of what 
good laundering means at home and to the community.

Digestion of the foodstuffs 

Having seen what each of the foodstuffs does in nourishing the 
body, we may now see how they are prepared for the use of the body 
in the digestive tract. 

Digestion of carbohydrate. The simplest carbohydrate is a 
sugar which cannot be broken up into other sugars. Such a simple 
sugar is called a monosaccharid. There are two common in foods, 
glucose and fructose ; a third, galactose, is derived from more com- 
plex sugars. Two simple sugars united chemically make a double 
sugar or disaccharid ; thus cane sugar or sucrose will yield glucose 
and fructose, while milk sugar or lactose will yield glucose and 
galactose, and maltose will yield two portions of glucose. These ' 
three disaccharids are the only common ones. Starches, dextrins, 
and cellulose or vegetable fiber are made of many simple glucose 



APPENDIX 385 

groups, and are hence called polysaccharids. All carbohydrates 
to be used by the body must be reduced to simple sugars. Glucose 
needs no digestion therefore, but the double sugars must be split 
by enzymes into two simple sugars in the intestinal juice, one 
for each kind, namely, sucrase (sucrose-splitting), maltase (mal- 
tose-splitting) and lactase (lactose-splitting). The digestion of 
starches and dextrins begins in the mouth, where amylase (starch- 
splitting) changes starch first to dextrin and finally to maltose, 
and maltase may change a little of the maltose so formed into 
glucose. In the stomach there are no enzymes acting on carbo- 
hydrates, but the digestion may continue under the influence of 
swallowed saliva for a time. In the pancreatic juice there is another 
amylase, which completes the splitting of starch to maltose, and 
then the intestinal maltase can reduce this to glucose, which will be 
absorbed. Cellulose cannot be digested and simply serves to add 
bulk to the diet. 

Digestion of fat. A fat is made up of two parts, one a fatty 
acid, the other glycerol. Fat cannot be absorbed by the body until 
it is split into these two parts. A fat splitting enzyme is called a 
lipase. There is none in the mouth ; one in the stomach works only 
on fat in the state of emulsion ; the most powerful is found in the 
pancreatic juice. Since fat cannot be digested in the mouth nor to 
any great extent in the stomach, it is bad to have food coated with 
it, for the protein and carbohydrates will have to wait till the fat is 
digested away, before they can be digested ; that is, till the intestine 
is reached. This is one reason why pastries and fried foods are hard 
to digest. 

Digestion of protein. There are no enzymes in the mouth acting 
on protein. In the stomach, the hydrochloric acid helps to make it 
soften and swell, and then pepsin begins its digestion. Protein, 
like fat and carbohydrate, can be subdivided into smaller and 
smaller portions, finally being reduced to a form which the body can 
absorb, namely, amino acids, of which there may be 17 or 18 kinds 
from a single protein. 

The digestion in the stomach produces chiefly large fragments of 
the original protein, called proteoses. In the pancreatic juice is a 
powerful enzyme called trypsin, which digests proteins, first to frag- 
ments, next smaller than proteoses, called peptones, and finally 
breaks these peptones into amino acids. In the intestinal juice is 

2c 



386 APPENDIX 

another enzyme called erepsin, which also forms amino acids from 
proteoses and peptones, thus finishing any digestion of protein left 
incomplete by the trypsin. 

Fate of the absorbed foodstuffs 

Carbohydrates, absorbed as glucose or other monosaccharids, are 
carried by the portal blood to the liver, and thence passed into the 
bloool, to be burned in the muscles, if needed for fuel, or stored tem- 
porarily in the liver and muscles as glycogen (a polysaccharid yield- 
ing glucose) for future conversion to sugar when required as fuel. 

Fats, passing through the intestinal wall as fatty acids and 
glycerol, enter the lymph largely as fat again, and finally pass to 
the blood to be burned in the muscles for fuel, or to be stored as fat 
until needed. 

Proteins pass into the blood as amino acids. Those needed for 
building material are taken up by the cells (especially cells of the 
muscles) and those not required for this purpose are freed from their 
nitrogen (in the liver or muscles) and then burned for fuel. 

For a fuller discussion of the fate of the absorbed foodstuffs see 
Chapter IV of Sherman's " Chemistry of Food and Nutrition."

Chemistry and its Relations to Daily Life 

BY LOUIS KAHLENBERG AND EDWIN B. HART 

Professors of Chemistry in the University of Wisconsin 

Cloth, J2mo, illustrated, 3Q3 pages. List price, 



If the contributions of chemical science to modern civilization 
were suddenly swept away, what a blank there would be ! If, on 
the other hand, every person were acquainted with the elements of 
chemistry and its bearing upon our daily life, what an uplift human 
efficiency would receive ! It is to further this latter end that this 
book has been prepared. Designed particularly for use by students 
of agriculture and home economics in secondary schools, its use will 
do much to increase the efficiency of the farm and the home. In 
the language of modern educational philosophy, it " functions in the 
life of the pupil." 

Useful facts - rather than mere theory have been emphasized, 
although the theory has not been neglected. The practical char- 
acter of the work is indicated by the following selected chapter 
headings : 

IL The Composition and Uses of Water, 

IV. The Air, Nitrogen, Nitric Acid, and Ammonia. 

IX* Carbon and Its Compounds. 

XIL Paints, Oils, and Varnishes. 

XIIL Leather, Silk, Wool, Cotton, and Rubber. 

XV* Commercial Fertilizers. 

XVI. Farm Manure. 

XX. Milk and Its Products. 

XXL Poisons for Farm and Orchard Pests.

Practical Physics 



By N. HENRY BLACK of the Roxbury Latin School, 
Boston, and Professor HARVEY N. DAVIS of Harvard 

University. 

Cloth, J2mo, illustrated, 488 pages. List price, $r.2j 

" In preparing this book," say the authors in the Preface, " we have tried to 
select only those topics which are of vital interest to young people, whether or 
not they intend to continue the study of physics in a college course. 

" In particular, we believe that the chief value of the informational side of 
such a course lies in its applications to the machinery of daily life. Everybody 
needs to know something about the working of electrical machinery, optical 
instruments, ships, automobiles, and all those labor-saving devices, such as 
vacuum cleaners, fireless cookers, pressure cookers, and electric irons, which 
are found in many American homes. We have, therefore, drawn as much of 
our illustrative material as possible from the common devices in modern life. 
We see no reason why this should detract in the least from the educational 
value of the study of physics, for one can learn to think straight just as well by 
thinking about an electrical generator, as by thinking about a Geissler tube. . . . 

" To understand any machine clearly, the student must have clearly in mind 
the fundamental principles involved. Therefore, although we have tried to 
begin each new topic, however short, with some concrete illustration familiar 
to young people, we have proceeded, as rapidly as seemed wise, to a deduction 
of the general principle. Then, to show how to make use of this principle, we 
have discussed other practical applications. We have tried to emphasize still 
further the value of principles, that is, generalizations, in science, by summariz- 
ing at the end of each chapter the principles discussed in that chapter. In 
these summaries we have aimed to make the phrasing brief and vivid so that 
it may be easily remembered and easily used." 

The new and noteworthy features of the book are the admirable 
selection of familiar material used to develop and apply the principles 
of physical science, the exceptionally clear and forceful exposition, 
showing the hand of the master teacher, the practical, interesting, 
thought-provoking problems, and the superior illustrations.

Botany for Secondary Schools 

BY L. H. BAILEY 

Of Cornell University 

Cloth, I2mo, illustrated, 460 pages. List price, 

It is not essential nor desirable that everybody should become a botanist 
but it is inevitable that people shall be interested in the more human side 
of plant and animal life. We are interested in the evident things of natural 
history, and the greater our interest in such things , the wider is our horizon 
and the deeper our hold on life. 

The secondary school could not teach botanical science if it would ; lack of 
time and the immaturity of the pupils forbid it. But it can encourage a 
love of nature and an interest in plant study ; indeed, it can originate these, 
and it does. Professor Bailey's Botany has been known to do it. 

In the revision of this book that has just been made, the effective simplicity 
of the nature teacher and the genuine sympathy of the nature lover are as 
successfully blended as they were in the former book. Bailey's Botany for 
Secondary Schools recognizes four or five general life principles : that no 
two natural things are alike ; that each individual has to make and main- 
tain its place through struggle with its fellows ; that " as the twig is bent 
the tree inclines " ; that " like produces like," and so on. . From these 
simple laws and others like them Professor Bailey proceeds to unfold a 
wonderful story of plant individuals that have improved upon their race 
characteristics, of plant communities that have adopted manners from 
their neighbors, of features and characteristics that have been lost by 
plants because of changed conditions of life or surroundings. The story 
vibrates with interest. 

The book is, moreover, perfectly organized along the logical lines of 
approach to a scientific subject. Four general divisions of material insure 
its pedagogical success : 

PART L The Plant Itself; 

PART II. The Plant in Its Relation to Environment and to Man; 

PART III. Histology, or the Minute Structure of Plants ; 

PART IV. The Kinds of Plants, including a Flora of 130 pages.

Studies in Literature 



BY FREDERICK MONROE TISDEL 

Assistant Professor of English in the University of Missouri. 

Cloth, i2ino. t illustrated, jjj> pages, list price $.90 

In Part I of this book the author introduces the student to more than 
twenty standard English classics, giving in connection with each a brief 
explanatory introduction, suggestions for study and topics for oral and 
written discussion. These classics are grouped with respect to the dif- 
ferent types of literature which they represent, epic, drama, essay, 
novel, etc., and there is a brief exposition of the type. The result is 
that in the mind of the reader the individual masterpiece and the type 
with its characteristics are inseparably connected. 

Part II consists of a brief but masterly survey of English literature. 
The book as a whole serves to systematize and unify the study of sec- 
ondary school literature, a most desirable end. 

Professor E. A. Cross, State Teachers College, Greeley, Colo. " It meets 
with my heartiest approval. It is brief, considers all the writers high school 
students need to know, touches the interesting features in the lives and works 
of these men, about all you could want it to do." 

Mr. John B. Opdycke, English Department of the High School of Commerce, 
New York City. " I like it very much indeed. It has just enough in its re- 
view of the history of English literature, and its treatment of the classics is 
restrained and dignified. So far as I have seen, this is the only book that 
combines the two in one volume. I am all against the use of an abstract 
History of English Literature in the high school and I am all in favor of put- 
ting into the hands of the students some book that analyzes classics fully and 
yet with restraint. This book seems to have combined the two in just the 
right proportions and treated them in just the right manner."
