This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

As the following directions were intended for 
the conduct of the families of the authoress's own 
daughters, and for the arrangement of their table, 
so as to unite a good figure with proper economy, 
she has avoided all excessive luvwy, such as essence 
of ham, and that wastrful expenditure of large 
quantities df meat for grwy, which so greatly 
contributes to keep up the price, and is no less in- 
jurious to those who eat' than to those whose penury 
obliges them to abstain* Many receipts are given 
for things, which being in daily Vse, the mode of 
preparing them may be supposed too well known to 
require a place in a cookery-hook ; yet how rarely 
-do we saeet withfne melted butter^goodtoast and 
water, or well-made coffee! She makes no apo" 
logy for minuteness in some articles, or for leaving 
others unnoticed, because she does not write for pro- 
fessed cooks. This little zcork would have been a 
treasure to herself when she first set out in life, and 
she therefore hopes it may prove useful to others. 
In that expectation it is given to the Public; and 
as she will receive from it no emolument, so she 
trusts it will escape without censure.

MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS 

FOR THB USE Or 

THE MISTRESS OF A FAMILY. 



In every rank^ those deserve the greatest praise, wiio 
best acquit themsel^ of the duties, iii^hich their station 
requires. Indeed tim line of conduct is not a matter of 
choice but of necessity, if we would msuntain the dignity 
of our character as rational beings. 

In the variety of female acquirements, though domes- 
tic occupations stand not so high in esteem as they for- 
merly did, yet when neglected, they produce much human 
misery. There was a time wjien ladies l^new nothing beyond 
their own family concerns ; but inthe present day there are 
many who know nothing aboiU them. Each of these ex- 
tremes should be avoided : but is there no way to unite 
in the lemale character, cultivation of talents and habits 
of usefiilness? Happily there are still great numbers ip 
every situation, whose example proves that this is possi- 
ble. Instances may be found of ladies in the higher 
ifalks of life, ^ho coodescend to examine the accounts 
of their house-steward ; and, by overlooking and wisely 
directing the expenditure of that part of their husband's 
income, which faUs under their own inspection, avoid 
the incon vjeniences of embarrassed circumstances. How , 
much more necessary, then, is domestic knowledge in 



( n ) 

' tliose whose limked fortunes pitfss on their attention con- 
sideratkxw of the strictest economy ! There ought to be 
a material difference in the degree of care which a per- 
son of a large and independent estate bestows on money 
concerns, and that of a person in confined circumstances: 
, yet both may very commendably employ some portion 
of their time and thoughts on thi? subject. The custom 
. of the times tends in some measure to abolish the dis- 
. tinctions of rank; and the education given to young peo- 
ple, is nearly the same in all: but though the leisure' of 
the higher may be well devoted tojglegant accomplish- 
ments, the pursuits of those in a middle line, if less or- 
namental, would better secure their own happiness and 
that of others connected with them. We somethnes 
bring up children in a manner calculated rather to -fit 
them for the station we wish, than that^which it is likely 
they will actually possess; and it is in all cases worth th^ 
, while of parents to consider whether the expectation or 
hope of raising their offspring ^ibove their own situation 
. b^ well-founded. 

The cultivation ©f the miderstanding aiid disposition, 

; however, is not here alhided to; for a judicious im- 

. provement of 'both, united to firm and early taught re- 

. ligious principles, would enable the happy possessor of 

, these advantages to act well on all occasions; nor would 

young ladies find domestic knowledge a burthen, or in- 

' consistent with higher attainments, if the rudiments of it 

were hiculcated at a tender age, when activity is $• 

. i laftasing. If employment be thesome to a healthy child, 

if«^ic fiLuH must be traced to habits which, firom many 

causes, are not at present favourable to the future con- 

'^-doGt^yt women. It frequently happens, that before im- 



( Hi ) 

prefsioDS of duty are made on the mmd, ornameut^ 

education commeBces ; and it erer after takes the lead t 

thus, what should be only the enibcllishinent^ becomes 

(he main business of life. There is no opportunity of 

attarning a knowledge of femily management at school; 

and during vacations, all subjects that might interfere 

with amusement are aWided. 

Wiien a giri, whose family moves In the higlier ranks 
of life, returns to reside at her father's house after com* 
pleting her education, her introduction to the gay wx>rld^ 
-gmd a 'Continued course of pleasures, persuade her at 
QBee tkat she was born to be the ornament of 'fiifhionable 
circles, rather than to ^toop (as she would conceive it) 
to undertake the arrangement of a family, tliongh by that 
Cleans she might in various ways augment the satisfaction 
find comfort of her parents. On the other hand, per* 
sons 'Of an inferior sphere, aad especially in the lower 
order .of middling iife, are almost always anxious to 
^ive^eir children sucii advantages of education as them* 
selves did not possess. Wh^her their indulgence be 
productive of the happiness so kindly aimed at, must be 
judged by the effects, which are not very favourable, if 
M^hat has been taught has net produced humility in her* 
self, and increased gratitude and respect to the authors 
of her being. Were a young woman brought to rdish 
home society, -and the calm delights of agreeable occu* 
patioQ, before she entered into the delusive scenes of 
pleasure, presented by the theatre and other dissipations, 
it is probable she would soon make a comparisoEi much 
in fiavour of the former, especially if restraiat did not 
jgivC'to the latter additional relish. 

If w« carry ou our observations to married life we shall 



( iv ) 

iindalo^ 0f employ ment to be the source of unnumbefed 
pleasures. To attend to the nui^iiig, aad at kast early 
instruction of children, and rear a healthy progeny in the 
^.ays of piety and usefulness : — to preside over the family 
jtfid regulate 4be income allotted to its maintenance: to 
indke heme the sweet nfugepf a husband fatigued by in;- 
tercourse with a jarring world : to be his enlightened comp 
panipn and the chosen friend of bis heart: these, these, 
;ire woman's duties 1 and delightful ones they are, if 
haply she be married to a man whose soul can duly e»* 
iimate lier woith, ^nd who will bring, his share to tbe 
cpmrnon stock of felicity. . Of such a woman, one. may 
truly sa^, « Happy the man who can call ber his wife. 
iUessed are the children who call her mother/' 

Wben we thqs observe ber, ^exercising her activity and 
lielt abilities in impropriate cares and increasing jex« 
cellence, are we not ready tp say, she is the agent for 
igpod of that benevolent Beii^, who placed her on earth 
fb fulfil such sacped oblig^ions, oof to *. ^te the talentf 
committed to her ""^ V- ? 

When it is. thus evident that the high intellectual at- 
tainments may £nd exercise in the multifarious occupa* 
lions «f t)ie daugbi^> the wife, the mother, and the mis- 
treses of the bou^e, can any one urge that the female mind .

Hence the direction of a table h no inconsiderable 
branch of a lady's concern, as it involves judgment iu 
expenditure ; respectability of appearance ; and the com- 
fort of her husband and those who partake their hospi- 
tality. 

The mode of covering the table diflfers in taste. It is 
not the multiplicity of things, but the choice, the dre«- 
* ing, and the neat pleasing look of the whole, which' 
gives respectability to her who presides. Too much, or 
too little dinners are extremes not uncommon : the latter 
is in appearance and reality the effort of poverty or pe^ 
iiuriousness to be gcnted; and the former, if constantly 
given, may endanger the circumfltances of those who dsp 
not affluent. 

Generally speaking, dianets are far less sinnphiouSj 
than formerly, when half a doz«n dishes were svpplied 
i^ what one now costs ; consequently those wh66€ for- 
tunes are not great, and who wish to make a genteel ap«^ 
plarance, without extravagance, rej^ulate their table ac- 
cordingly. 

^Perhaps there 2xst few incidents in which the respecta^ 
bility of a man is more immediately felt, than the style 
of dinner to which he accidentally may bring home a « 
visitor. Every one is to Hve as he can afibrd, and the . 
meal of the tradesman ought not to emulate the enter- \ 
tainraents of the higher classes, but if two or three dt^hes 
are' well served, with the usual saude^, the taS^e-linea . 
clean, the small sideboard nrdHy laid^^and all\tliat'\s " 
necessary be at hand, the expectation of the.^Hisoaha , 
ana fnend will be gratified, because no irregu^rity'of 
oom^tic arrangement will disturb the social mtercourse. ^., 
the same observatloiv holds good' <$n a largi^r scale. Ir .,

all situations of life, the entertainmotit should be no less 
suited to the station, than to the fortune of the enter^ 
tainer, aud to the number and rank of those Invited. 

"The manner of carving is not only a very necessary 
branch of information, to enable a lady to doifae honours 
of her table, but makes a considerable difierence m the 
consumption of a family : and though in large parties 
she is so much assisted as to render this knowledge z^ 
parently of less consequence, yet she must at times fed 
the deficiency ; and should not fail to acquaint herself 
with an attainment^ the advantage of which is evident 
everyday. 

I Iifdeed, as fashions are so fleeting, itas more dian pre* 
bs^^^that before the end of this century, gceat atten* 
lion to guests may be again the mode, as it was in the 
commencement of the last. Some people haggle meat 
^^p n^uchj as not. to be able to help half-a-dozen persons 
. decently from. a large .tongue, or a sirloio of beef; and 
the dish goes away ^th the appearance of having been 
gnawediby dogs. If the daughters of the family were to 
take the. head of. the table under the direction of their 
raother> they .would fulfil its duties with grace, in the 
same easy .manner as an early practice in other domestic 
affairs gradually j^ts tliem for their own future houses. 
Habit alone can .make good cacvers^ but some principal 
directions ^re hereafter j;iven, with a reference to t£e an- 
nexed plates. 

The mistress of a femily «hould always remember that 
the welfare and good management of the house depend 
on the eye of the superior ; and consequently that no- 
thing b too trifling for her notice, whereby .waste may- 
be avoided ; and this attention is of more importance 



( vii ). 

BOW that the price of every necessary of life is increased 
to a& enormous degree^ 

If a lady has never been accustomed, wkile single, to 
Hatik of family management, let her not upon that ac- 
count fear that she cannot attain it ; she may consult 
others who are move experienced,, and acquaint herself 
with the necessary quantities of the severat articles of 
family expenditure, in proportion to the number it con- 
sists of, the proper prices to pay,. &c. &c. 

Aminnte account of the annual income, and the times 
of payment,, should be taken in writing ; likewise an esti* 
nateof the supposed amount of each article of expense ; 
and those who are early accustomed to calculations 'on 
domestic articles^ will acquire so accurate a knowledge 
of what their establishment requires, as will give them 
the happy medium between prodigality atd parsimony, 
without acquiring the character of meanness. 

Perhaps few branches of female education are so use- 
ful, as great readiness at figures. Accounts should be 
regularly kept, and not the smallest article omitted to be 
entered ; and if balanced every week and montli, &c. 
the income and outgoings will be ascertained with faci- 
lity, and their proportions to each other be duly ol> 
sei^ved.. Somtt peopJe fix on stated sunm to be appro- 
priated to each different article, and keep the money in 
separate purses; as house, clothes, pocket,, education 
of children, &c. Whichever way accounts be entered, 
a certain mode should be adopted, and strictly adhered 
to. Many women are unfortunately ignorant of the state 
of their husband's income ; and others are only made 
acquainted with it, when some speculative project, or 
profitable transaction, leads them to make a false ebti-

those that are most reasonable, when they will answer as 
weU for others of the same kind, but which are more 
costly. A false notion of economy leads many to pur- 
chase aa* bargains, what is not. wanted,, and sometimes 
nefer is used. Were this error avoided, more money 
would remain iet other purposes. It is not unusual among 
lower dealers to put oiT a larger quantity of goods^ by 
assurances that they are advancmg in price ;.and many 
who supply fancy articles are so successful in persuasioo, 
that purchasers not unfrequently go far beyond their 
•ri^^nal^inteBtton, even to their own future disquiet. Som.e 
things: are better for keeping, and, being in constant con- 
sumption, should be laid in accordingly ; such as papcr^ 
soap, and candles. Of these more hereafter* 

To give -unvarying rulos cannot be attempted; for 
people ought lo form tlieir conduct on their .circum- 
stances, but it is presumed that a judicious arrangement 
according to them, will be found equally advantageDus 
to all. The minutiae of mans^ement must be.regulated 
by every one's fortune and rank ; some ladies, not dc* 
iicient in either> charge themselves with giving outji once 
.m a month, to a superintending servant, such quantities 
of household articles, as by observation and calculatiou 
they know to be sufficient, reserving for their own key 
the large stock of things usually laid in for very large 
families in the country. Should there be several more 
visitors than usual, they can easily account for increase 
of consumption, and vice versa. Such a degree of judg^ 
ment will be respectable even in the eye of domestics^ 
if they are not interested in the ignorance of their .eni-» 
ployers ; and if they are, their services will not comptm* 
sate for want of honesty.

When young, ladies marry, they frequently conlinue.

If the subject of servants be thought ill-timed in a 
book upon Bsimity arrangement, it must be by those whet 
do not recollect that the regularity and good manage* 
ment of the hf^ds will be insufficient, if not seconded 
by these who are to execute orders.. It behaves every 
person to. be extremely carefu^ whom^ he takes into his 
service; to be very minute in investigating the charac* 
(kr he^receites, and eqeally cautious and scrupulously 
j^ust in giving one to others. Were this attended to„

aent. To refuse countenance to the evil, and to eiv- 
courage the good servant, are actions due to society at 
large; and such as are honest, fruga], and attentive to 
tiieir duties^ should be liberally rewarded, ivhich would 
encourage merit, and inspire servants with zeal, to acquit 
tliemselves. 

. It may be proper to observe that a retributive justice 
usually marks persons in that station sooner or latffr even 
in this world. The extravagant and idle in seiritude, 
are ill prepared for the industry and sobriety on which 
theif own future welfare so essentially depends. Their 
faults, and the attendant punishment come home when 
ikey have children <tf their own ; and sometimes much 
j^ner. They wUl see their own folly and wickedness 
perpetuated in their offspring, whom they must not ex- 
pect to be better than the example and instruction given 
by themselves. 

It was the observation of a sensible and experienced 
woman, that she could always read the fate of her ser- 
vants who married ; those who had been faithful and in- 
(lustrious in her service, continued their good habits in 
their own families, and became respectable members of 
the community :— those who were the contrary, never 
were successful, afid not unfrequently were reduced to* 
the parish.

Though it is very disagreeable to suspect any one** 
honesty, and perhaps mistakes have been unintentional ; 
yet it is prudent to weigh meat, sugars, &c. when brouglit 
hk, and compare with the charge. The butcher should 
be or^jCTedto send the weight With the meat, and the 
book to file these checks, to be examined when tb« 
weekly biH sliall be delivered. 

i. Much trouble and irregularity are saved when there* 
is company, if s«rvaBts are required to prepare the table 
and sideboard in similar order daily. 

AM things likely to be wanted should be ift i«adin^s8 ; 
sugars of diR^rent qualities kept broken, cMrraats vushec^ 
picked, and' perfectly dry, spices pounded, and kept ia 
Yery small bottles closely corked; not meie than will 
lie used ifi four or five weeks should be pounded at a 
time. Much less is necessary than when boiled whole ia.

Where noonings or suppers are served) (and in every

beautiful aiticles. 

- The price of starch depends upon that of flour ; the 
best will keep good in a dry warm room for some years>; 
Mierefore when bread is cheap it may be bought to ad- 
vantage, and covered close. 

SuQARS being an article of considerable expense in all 
families, the purchase demands particular attention. The 
theapest does not go so far as that more refined ; and 
.there is difference even in the degree of sweetness. The 
white should be chosen that is close, heavy, and shin* 
ing. The best sort of brown has a bright gravelly look, 



Many good laundresses adrise soaping linen in warmi 
"water the night previous to washing, as facilitating the 
operation with less friction. 

Soap should l>e cut with'a wire or twine, in pieces that 
ivUl make a long square when first brought iu» and kept- 
out of the air two or three weeks ; for if it dry quick, it 
will crack, and when wet, break. Put it on a shelf, leavi- 
ing a space between, and let it grow hard gradually. 
Thus, it will save a full third in the consumption. 

Some of the lemons and oranges used for juice should^ 
be pared first to preserve the peel dI^y ; some should be 
halved, and when s(]ueezed, the pulp cut out, ^nd the out« 
sides dried for grating. If for boiling in any liquid, the- 
first way is best. When tliese fmits are cheap, a proper 
quantity should be bought and prepared as above di-- 
rected, especially by those who live in the country,, 
where they cannot always be had ; and they are perpe-- 
tually wanted in cookery.. 

When whites of eggs are used for jelly, or other pur-- 
poses, contrive to have pudding, custard, &c. to employ, 
the yolks also. Should you not want them for several < 
hours, beat them upiwith a little water,. and put them in. 
a cool place, or they will be hardened, and useless. It 
was a mistake of old, to tbink.that the whites made cakes, 
and puddings heavy; ;.on the contrary, jf beaten long and 
separately, they .contribute greatly, to give lightness, are 
an advantage to- paste, .and make a pretty dish beaten, 
with fruit, to set in cream, &c 

If copper utensils be used in the kitchen, the cook 
should be cliarged to be very careful not .to let the tin be 
rubbed of!Y and to have them fresh doue when the least 
defect appearS). and never to put by any soup, gravy,.

kc. intbem, or any metal utensil; stone and earthen 
Tcssels should be provided for those purposes^ as likei^i^e 
plenty of common dishes, that the table set may be used 
to put by cold meat. 

Tin vessels, if kept dunpf soon rust, nrhlch taases 
holes, Fenders, and tin linings of flower-pots, ^c. fthould 
be pamted ^very year ^ two. 

. Vegetables soon sour, and corrode metals and glaaed 
red ware, by which a strong poison is produced. Some 
yean ago} the deatb of ^ereral gentlemen.was occasioned 
at Salt-hill, by the cook sending a ragout to table, which 
the had kept from the preceding day in a coj^r vessel 
badly tinned. 

9 Vinegar, by its acidity, does the same, the glazing be- 
ing of lead or arsenic. 

To cool liquors in ho\ weather> dip a cloth in cold 
water, and wrap it round the bottle t>%o or three times, 
then place it in the sun; renew the process otice or 
twice. 

The best way of scalding fruits, or boiling vinegar, is 
in a stone jar on a hot iron hearth ; or by putting the 
vessel into a sauce-pan of water, called a water-bath. 
- if chocolate, coffee, jelly, gruel, bark, &c. be suffered 
to boil over, the strength is lost. ' 

The cook should be encouraged to be careful of coals 
and cinders : for the latter there is a new contrivance to 
sift, without dispersing the dust of the ashes, by means of 
a covered tin bucket. 

Small coal wetted n>akes the strongest fire for Ihe 
back, but must remain untouched until it^cake. Ctn- 
de«s, lightly wet, give a great degree of heat, an(\ ai:e 
better than coal for furnaces^ ironiog-stoves, and ovcus* 



Hie cook should be charged to take cafe of jelly-b^g^ 
fapes for the collared things, &c. which if not perfectly 
scalded^ and kept dry, give an unpleasant flavour wheir

Cold water thrown on cast iron, when hot, will cause 
it to crack. 

h) the following and indeed all other receipt, though 
the quantities may be as accurately directed as poKnble, 
yet much must be left to the discretion of the person 
who uses them. The different tastes of people require 
more or less of the flavour of spices, salt, garlic, butter# 
ftc which can never be ordered by -general rules ; and 
if the cook has not a good taste, and attention to that of 
her employers, not all the ingredients which nature i%d 
art can furnish, will give exquisite flavour to her di9b^' 
The proper articles should be at hand, and she must pro*

^, fhe cook should give orders to the butcher to dh'ide 
the joints of the bones of all carcase-joints of mutton/ 
Vunb, and veal, (such as neck, breast, and loin ;) wbiclf 
may then be easily cut into thin slices attached to ther 
adjoining bones. If the whole of the meat belonging to 
each bone should be too thick* a small slice may be taken

«f rautton, and beeQ sre to be helped in thin slices, 
neatly cut and smooth ; observhig to let the knife pass- 
dolm to the bone in -the mutton and beef joints. 

The dish ^ould not be too far off the carver ; as it 
gives an awkward appearance, and makes the task more 
di^cutt. Attention is to be paid to help every one to a 
part-of such articles as are considered the best. 

In helping fish, take care hot to breaH the ^kes ; 
which in cod and very fresh salmon are large, and con* 
tribute much to the beauty of its appearance. A fw»h- 
knife, not being sharp, divides it best on this accounts 
Help a part of the roe, milt, or liver, to each person. 
The heads of carp, parts of those of cod and salmon, 
sounds of cod, and fins of turbot> are likewise esteemed 
niceties, and are to be attended to accordingly. 

In cutting up any wild-fowl, duck, goose, or turkey, 
for a large party, if you cut the slices down from pinion 
to pinion, without making wings, there will be more 
prime pieces. 

ji Cod's i/ffld— Fish in general requires very little 
carving, the fleshy parts being those principally esteemed. 
A cod's head and shoulders, when in season, and pro- 
perly boiled, is a very genteel and handsome dish. When 
cut, it should be done with a fish-trowel, and the parts

about the back-bone on the shoulden- are the most firm: 
and the best. Take ofTa piece quite down to the boae^.

which lies undernearth tlie back-bone and lines it« the 
meat of which is thin, and a little darker-coloured tfasfl 
the body of the fish itself: this may be got by passings, 
knife or spoon underneath, in the direction dy /, About . 
the head are many delicate parts, and a great deal of the. ^ 
jelly kind. The jelly part lies about the jaw, bones, and - 
the firm parts within the bead^ Some are fond of the i 
palate, and others the tongue, which likewise may be goi 
by putting a spoon into the mouthw 

Edge-bone nfBcef. — Cut off a slice an inch thick all 
the length from a to S, in (he figure opposite the last pager 
and then help. The soft fat which resembles marrow, 
lies at the back of the bone, below c; the firm fat must 
be cut in horizontal slices at the edge of the meat d. It is 
proper to ask which is preferred, as tastes differ. Tlie 
skewer that keeps tlie meat properly together when boil- 
ing is here shewn at a. lliis should be drawn out before 
it is ser\'ed up ; or, if it is necessary to leave the skewer 
in, put a silver one. 

Sirloin of Beef may be begun either at the end, or by 
cutting into the middle. It is usual to in()uire wliether 
the outside or the inside is preferred. For the oulsitle^ 
the slice shoujd be cut down to the bones; and the sau>9 
with every following helping. SHce tlie inside, likewisej^ 
and give with each piece some of the sgft fat. 

The inside done as. follows eats excellently : Have 
ready some shalot- vinegar boiling hut: mince the meat 
large, and a goadd^al of the fat;. sprinkle it with salt|,ani.

Round or Buttock of Beef is cut in the same way as 

fillet of veal, in the Jiext article. It should be kept even 

^ a\\ over. When helping the fat, observe not to hack it, 

\ \>utcut it smooth. A deep slice should be cut off the 

Wf before you begin to help, as directed abov£ for the 

Edge-bone. 

Fiikt of Veal. — In an ox this part is round of bee£ 
Ask whether the brown outside be liked, otherwise help 
"the n(^t slice. The bone is taken out, and the meat tied 
elese, before dressings which makes the fillet very solid« 
, It should be cut thin« and very smooth. A stuffing is put 
into the flap, which completely covers it ; you must cut 
^eep into this, and help a thin slice, as likewise •f fat* 
' . From carelessness in not covering the latter with paper, 
it is sometimes driec^l up, to the great disappointment of 
the carver. 

Breast of yeal» — One part (which is called the brisket) 
15 thickest, and has gristles; put your knife about four 
inches from the edge of this, and cut througli it, which 
will separate the ribs from the brisket. Ask which is 
chosen, and help accordingly. 

Calfs Head has SL great deal of meat upon it, if pro- 
perly managed. Cut slices from a to b, in the figure 
opposite prtgt? 22, letting the Jcnife go'close.to the bone. 
In the fleshy part, at the neck end c, there lies the throat 
sweetbread, which you should help a slice of from do d 
with the other part. Many like the eye ; which you 
must out out with the point of your knife, and divide in 
two. If the jaw-bone be taken off, there will be found 



( xxiv ) 

some fine lean. Under the head is the palate, nrhich i$ 
reckoned a nicety ; the lady of the house should be ao-j 
qiiainted with all things that are thought so, that she ma) 
distribute them among her guests. 

Sfiouldcr of Mutton, — ^This is a very good joint, and 
by many preferred to the leg; it being Very full of gravy, 
if properly roasted, and produces many nice bits. The 
iSgure represents it as laid in the dish with its back uppec^ 
most. When it is first cut, it should be in the holloa 
part of it, in the direction of a, b, and the knife should 
be passed deep to the bone. The prime part of the fat 
lies on the outer edge, and is to be cut out in thin slice* 
in the direction e. If many are at table, and the hollow 
part cut in the line a, b, is eaten, some very good and 
delicate slices may be cut out on each side the ridge of 
the blade-bone, in the directions, d. The line betweea 
these two dotted lines, is that in the direction of whick 
the edge or ridge of the blacf e-bene lies, and cannot be 
cut across. 

Leg of Mutton, — A leg of wether mutton (which is the 
best flavoured) may be known by a round lump of £it at 
the edge of the broadest part, as at a. The best part is 
in tlie midway, at b, between the knuckle and further 
end. Begin to help there, by cutting thin deep slices 
to c. If the outside is not fat enough, help some from 
the side of the broad end in slices from e to/. This part 
is most juicy; but many prefer the knuckle, which in 
iSne mutton will be very tender though dry. There are 
very fine slices on the back of the leg: turn it up, and 
cut the broad end ; not in the direction you did the other 
side, bAit longways. To cut out the cramp-bone, take

Md <^ the shank with your left-hand, and cut down to 
tt thigh-bone at d ; then pass the knife under tlie cramp* 
bone in the direction, d, g. 

Afore Suarter of Lamb. — Separate the shoulder from 
Ihe scoven (which is the breast and rilis), by passing the 
knife under in the direction of a, b, c, d, in the figure 
IB^posite the last page ; keeping it towards you horizon- 
, ViUy, to prevent cutting the meat too much off the bones. 
If grass-lamb, the shoulder being large, put it into 
foother dish. Squeeze the j uice of half a Seville orange 
(or lemon) on the other part, and sprinkle a little salt and 
f|epper. Then separate the gristly part from the ribs in 
^ line e, c; and help either firom that, or from the ribs^ 
3a may be chosen. 

Haunch of Venuon, — Cut down to the bone in the line 
4^ b, c, in the figure opposite the next page, to let out 
the gr.vy : then turn the broad end of the haunch to- 
ward you, put in the knife at 6, and cut as deep as you 
caa to the end of the haunch d; then help in thin slices, 
W»erving.to give some fat to each person. There is 
more fat (which is a favourite part) on the left side of c 
and d than on the other ; and those who help must take 
care to proportion it, as likewise the gravy, according to 
the number of the company. 

JUwmck qf Mutton is the leg and part of the loin, cut 
flo AS to resemble haunch of venison, and is to be helped 
at table in the same manner. 

Saddle of Mutton. — Cut long thin slices from the tail 
to the end, beginning close to the backbone. If a large 
point, the slice may be divided. Cut some fat firom the 

ffamn^y i»e.<»|t three ways ; the coi|in^Qx^ method is^ 



( xxvi ) 

to begin in the middle, by long slices from a to h, 
the centre through the thick fat. This brings to 
prime at first ; which is likewise accomplished by cult 
a small round hole on the top of the bam as at c, and wil 
a sharp knife enlarging that by cutting successive thin 
cles: this preserves the gravy, and keeps the meat moist'^ 

The last and most saving way is, to begin at the h< 
end (which many are most fond of), and proceed 
wards. 

Ham that is used for pies, &c. should be cut from 
under side, first taking off a thick slice. 

Sucking Pig, — ^The cook usually divides the body 
fore it is sent to table, and garnishes the dish with 
jaws and ears. ' • 

The first thing is, to separate a shoulder firom the car- 
case on one side, and then the leg according to the dh'ec-< 
tion given by the dotted line a', b, c. The ribs are thea 
to be divided into about two helpings ; and an ear or ja# 
presented with them, and plenty of sauce. The jointi 
may either be divided into two each, or pieces may be 
ctit from them. The ribs are reckoned the finest part'; " 
but some people prefer the neck-end, between thfc 
shoulders. 

Goose. — Cut off the apron in the circular line a, h, ^, 
in the figure opposite the last page ; and pour into the 
body a glass of port wine, and a large tea-spoonful of. 
mustard, first mixed at the sideboard. Turn the neck 
end of the goose towards you, and cut the whole breast 
in long slices from one wing to another; but only remove 
them as you help ^each person, unless the company is so 
large as to re<juire the legs likewise. Tiiis way givesmoF^ 
prime bits than by making wings. Take off the leg, by

putting the fork into the small end of the bose, pressing 
it to the body, and having passed the knife at d, turn the 
leg back, and if a young bird, it will easily separate. To 
take off the wing, put your fork into the small end of the 
pinion, and press it Close to the body ; then put in the 
knife at d, and divide the joint, taking it down in the 
direction, d, e. Nothing but practice will enable people 
to hit ihe joint exactly at the first trial. . When the leg 
and wing of one side are donej go on to the other ; but 
it is not often necessary to cut up the whole goose, unless 
the company be very large. There are two side bones 
^y the wing, which may be cut off; as likewise the back 
8nd lower side-bones : but the best pieces are the breast,' 
and the thighs after being divided from the drum-sticks. 

Hare, — ^The best way of cutting it up is, to put the 
point of the knife under the shoulder at a, in the figure 
opposite (he next page, and so cut all the way down to 
■ the rump, on one side of the back-bone, in the line a,' b, 
I^olhe same on the other side, so that the whole hare will 
"^ divided into three parts. Cut the back into four,, 
vhich with the legs is the part most esteemed. The 
shoulder must be cut off in a circular line, as c, d, a ; 
«)' the pieces neatly on the dish as you cut them ; and' 
*"^o help the company, giving some pudding and gravy 
w every person. This way can only be practised when- 
*"p hare is young: if old, don't divide it down, which 
^"^ J^Cjuire a strong arm : but put the knife between the 
^S ^tidback, and give it a little turn inwards at the 
. ^^ 5 which you must endeavour to hit, and not to 
^alc by force. When both legs are taken off, there is 
^^ lollop on each side the back, then divide tlie back • 
^* tnany pieces- as you please, and tak^ ott X\va

shoulden, which are by many preferred^ and are call^^ 
the spprtsroan's pieces. When every one is helped, c*^* 
off the head ; put your knife between the upper and low^' 
jaw, and divide them, which will enable you to lay tb»^ 
upper flat on your plate ; then put the point of the kni^^ 
into the centre, and cut the head into two. The ear^ 
and brains may be helped then to those who like them. 

Carve Babbits as directed the latter way for hare ^ 
cuttmg the back into two pieces, which with the legs are 
the prime. 

A FowL — A boiled fowl^s legs are bent inwards, and 
tucked into the belly ; but before it is served, the skewers 
are to be removed. Lay the fowl on your plate; and 
place the joints, as cut off, on the dish. Take the wing 
off in the direction of a to b, in the annexed engraving, 
only dividing the joint with your knife; and then 
with your fork lift up the pinion, and draw the wing to- 
wards the legs, and the muscles will separate in a mere 
complete form than if cut. Slip the knife between the 
leg and body, and cut to the bone; then with the fork 
turn the kg back, and the joint will give way if the bird 
is not old. When the four quarters are thus removed, 
take off the merry thought from a, and the neck-bones ; 
these last by putting in the knife at c, and pressing it 
under the long broad part of the bone in the line c, b : 
then lift it up, and break it off from the part that sticks 
to the breast. The next thing is, to divide the breast 
from the carcase, by cutting through the tender ribs close 
to the breast, quite down to the tail. Then lay the back 
upwards, put your knife into the bone half-way firom the 
neck to the rump, and on raising the lower end it will 
separate readily* Turn the rump from you, and very

TUBBOT, if good, should be thick, aod the MI7 of 
ijeliowish white ; if of a bluish cast, or thin, they are 
bad. They are in season the greatest part of the sum- 
mer. 

Mium.^— If new, theflesh is of a fine red (the gills 
particularly), the scales bright, and the whole fish i tiflf. 
^hen just killed, there is a whiteness between the 
flakes, which gives great firniness; by keepiitt, this 
^clts down, and the ifish is more rich. The l^ames 
salmon bears the highest price; that caught in the Se- 
^^rn is next in goodness, and is even preferred by some. 
Small heads, and thick in the neck are best 

Cod. — ^The gills should be very red : the fish should 
^ very thick at the neck, the flesh white and firm, and 
«ic eyes fresh. When flabby they are not good. They 
are in season from the beginning of December till the 
«nd of April. 

<S4ate. — If ^ good, they are very white and thick. If

two days.

must be stiff and finn.

aettl j take off the two sidesmen, and the whole will be 
doiie. As each part is taken off, it should be tume4 
neatly on the dish: and care should be taken that what 
ji left goes properly from table. The breast and wings 
are looked upon as the best parts ; but the legs are most 
juicy. Id young fowls. After all, more advantage will be 
gained by observing those who carve well, and a little 
practice, than by any written directions whatever. 

A PheoMoU. — ^The bird in the annexed engraving is as 
trussed for the spit, with its head under one of its wings. 
When the skewers are taken out, and the bird served, 
the following is the way to carve it : 

Fix your fork in the centre of the breast ; slice it down 
in the line a, h ; take off the leg on one side in the dot* 
ted line h, d ; then cut off the wing on the same side, 
in the line c, d. Separate the leg and wing on the other 
side, and then cut off the slices of breast you divided be- 
fore. Be careful how you take off the wings; for if you 
should cut too near the neck as at g, you will hit on the 
neck-bone, from which the wing must be separated. Cut 
off the merrythought in the line/, g, by passing the knife 
under it towards the neck. Cut the other parts as in a 
fowl. The breast, wings, and merrythought, are the 
most esteemed; but the leg has a higher flavour. 

Partridge, — ^Tlie partridge is here represented as just 
taken from the spit ; but before it is served up, the skewers 
must be withdrawn. It is cut up in the same manner as 
a fowl. The wings must be taken off in the linj a, b, 
and the merrythought in the line c, d. The prime parts 
of a partndge ate the wings, breast, and merrythought. 
But the bird being small, the two latter are not often 
divided. The wing is considered as the best, and the tip 
of it reckoned the most delicate morsel of the who\t. 



8 DOMKSTrc COOK£JlT« 

all is col^, pack the fish in something deep, and let there 
be f Doogb of pickle to plentifully cover. Preserve it 
from the air. The liquor must be drained from the fisb, 
aknl occasionally boiled and skimmed. 

Salmon collared. 
Split such a part of the fish as may be sufficient to make 
an handsome roll, wash and wipe it, and having mixed 
salt, white pepper, pounded mace, and Jamaica pepper, 
in quantity to season it very high, rub it inside and out 
well. Then roll it tight and bandage it^ put as much 
water and one-third vinegar as will cover it^ witli bayr 
leaves, salt, and both sorts of pepper. Cover close, and 
simmer till done enough. Drain and boil quick the li- 
quor, and put on when cold. Serve with fennel. It is 
an elegant dish, and extremely good. 

COD. 

Some peop/le boil the' cod whole; but i large hea^ 
and shoulders contain all the fish that is proper to help^, 
the thinner parts hemg overdone and tasteless, before 
the thick are ready. But the whole fish may be pur- 
chased at times more reasonably ; and the lower half,. If 
sprinkled and hung up, will be In high perfection one oir 
two days. Or it may be made sftHer, and served with 
«gg-sau6e, potatoes, and parsnips. 

Cofl wHen snMdl is usually very cheap. If boiled quitfc 
fresh it is watery ; but eats excellently ,if salted and bung 
up for a day, to give it iirmne&s, then stuffed, and broiled, 
or boiled. 

Cod*fi Head and Skouldcrs 
Will eat mucl) finer by having a little salt rubbed down 
the bone, and along the thick part, even K to be eatefi

Tie it up, and put it on the fire in cold water which 
will completely cover it: throw a handful of salt into 
it. Great care must be taken to serve it without the 
smallest speck of black or scum. Graniish with a large 
quantity of double parsley, lemon, horse-radish, and 
tjie xnilt, roe^ aod Uvcr, and fried smelts if approved.

10 DOMESTIC COOKE&T. 

Curric of Cod 
Should be made of sliced cod, that has either been 
frimped or sprinkled a day, to make it firm. Fry it of 
a fine brown with onions ; and stew it with a good white 
gravy, a little currie^poWder, a bit of butter and flour, 
three or four spoonfuls of rich cream, salt, and Cayenne, 
if the powder be not hot enough. 

To dress salt Cod, 
Soak and clean the piece you mean to dress, then lay 
it all night in water, with a glass of vinegar. Boil it 
enough, then break it into flakes on the dish ; pour over 
it parsnips boiled, beaten in a mortar, and then boiled 
up with cream and a large piece of butter rubbed vrith a 
bit of flour. It may be served as above with egg-sauce 
instead of the parsnip, and the root sent up whole ; or 
the fish may be boiled and sent up vrithout flaking, and 
sauces as above. 

STV&GEON. 

To dress fresh Sturgeon, 

Cut slices, rub egg over them, then sprinkle with 
crumbs of bread, parsley, pepper, salt : fold them in 
paper, and broil geutly. 

Sauce ; butter, anchoVy, and soy. 

To roast Sturgeon. 

Put It on a lark-spit, then tie it on a large spit ; baste 
it constantly with butter ; and serve with a good gravy, 
an anchovy, a squeeze of Seville orange or lemon, and a 
glass of sherry. 

j4notfier. 

Put a piece of butter, rolled in flour, into a stew-pan 
with four cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, two onions, 
some pepper and salt, half a pint of water, and a glass 
of vinegar. Stir it over the fire till hot ; then let it be- 
come lukewarm, and steep the fish in it an hour or two. 
Butter a paper well, tie it round, and roast it without 
letting the spit run through. Serve with sorrel and an< 
chovy-sauce. 



FISH. 1 1 

An excellent Imitation qf pickled Sturgeon, - 
Take a fine large turkey, but not old ; pick it very 
nicely, singe, and make it extremely clean : bone an4 
ivasb it, and tie it across and apross with a bit of mat- 
string washed clean. Put into a very nice tin saucepan 
a quart of water, a quart of vinegar, a qiuurt of white 
(but not sweet) wine, and a very large handful of salt '; 
boil and skim it well, then b6il the turkey. When done 
enough tighten the strings, and lay upon it a dish with a 
vreight of two pounds over it. 

Boil the liquor half an hour ; and when both are cold, 
put the turkey into it. This will keep some months 
sind eats more delicately than sturgeon ; vinegar, oil, 
<uid sugar, are usually eaten with it If more vinegar 
^^ salt should be wanted, add when cold. Send feiui^I 
over it to table. 

Thomhack and Skate 
Should be hung one day at least before they are dressed ; 
^d may be served either boiled, or fried in crumbs, be.« 
iog first dipped in e^. 

Crimp Skate. 
Boil and send up in a napkin : or fry as above. 

Maids 
Should likewise be hung one day at least. They imay 
be broiled or fried ; or, if a tolerable size, the middle

MACKEREL. 

Boil, and serve with butter and fennel. 

To broil them, split, and sprinkle u'ith herbs, pepper, 
and salt ; or stutf with the same^ crumbs, and chopped 
fennel. 

Collared, as Eel, page 17. 

Potted : clean, season, and bake them in a pan with 
spice, bay-leaves, and some butter; when cold, lay 
^eta in a potting-pot, and cover with butter. 

Pickled: boil them, then boil some of the liquor, a 
^ peppers, bay-leaves, and some vinegar ; when cold, 
P<^r it over them. 

Pickled Mackerel^ called Caveach. 

Clean and divide them ; then cut each side into three, 

or leaving them undivided, cut each fish into five or six 

pieces. To six large mackerel, take near an ounce of 

pepper, two nutmegs, a little mace, four cloves, and a 

handful of salt, all in the finest powder ; mix, and 

making holes in each bit of fish, thrust the seasoning 

. into them, rub each piece with some of it ; then fry 

them brown in oil; let them stand till cold, then put 

them into a stone-jar, and cover with vinegar; if to 

keep long, pour oil on the top. Thus done, they may 

be preserved for months. 

Red Mullet. 

It is called the Sea-Woodcock. Clean, but leave the 
inside, fold in oiled paper, and gently bake in a small 
dish. Make a sauce of the liquor that comes from the 
fish, with a piece of butter, a little flo^r, a little essence 
of anchovy, and a glass of sherry. Give it a boil ; and 
secye in a baat^ ^/ad the£sh in the papei^ caseft.

To dress Pipers. 

Boil, or bake them with a pudding well seasoned.*—- 
If baked, put a large cup of rich broth into the dish ; 
and when done, take that, some essence of anchovy^ 
and a squeeze of lemon, and boil them up together for 
sauce. 

To bake Pike, 

Scale it, and open as near the throat, as you can, then 
stuff it with the following ; grated breads herbs, anclio* 
vies, oysters, suet, salt, pepper, mace, half a pint of 
cream, four yolks 'of eggs ; mix all over the fire till it 
thickens, then put it into the fish, and sew it up ; butter 
should be put over it in little bits; bake it 'Serve sauce 
of gravy, butter, and anchovy. Note : if in helping 
a pike, the back and belly are slit up, and each slice 
gently drawn do\^nwards, there will be fewer bones 
given. 

HADDOCK. 

Boil or broil xtfith stiffing as under, hating salted them 

a day. 

To dry Haddock, 

Choose them of two or three pounds weight : take out 
tlie gills, eyes, and entrails, and remove the blood from 
the backbone. Wipe them dry, and put some salt into 
the bodies and eyes. Lay them on a board for a night ; 
then hang them up in a dry place, and after three or 
four days they will be fit to eat; skin and rub them 
with egg ; and strew crumbs over them. Lay them be-, 
fore the £re, and baste with butter until brown enough. 
Secve with egg-sauce. 

fTkitings, if large, are excellent this way ; and it will 
prove an accommodation in the country where there is no 
regular supply of fish. 

Stuffing for Pike, Haddock f and smaJtl Cod, 

Take equal parts of fat bacon, beef-suet, and fresh 

butter, some parsley, thyme, and savoury; a little 

onion, and a few leaves of scented msujoram shred fine \ 

an anchovy or two ; a little salt and nutmeg, and some

pepper. Oysters will be an improvement with or witln 
out anchovies ; add crumbs, and an egg to bind. 

SOLES. 

If boiled 9 they must be served with great care to 
look perfectly white, and should be much covered with 
parsley. 

If fried, dip in egff, and cover them with fine crumbs 
of bread ; set on a trying-pan that is just large enough, 
and put into it a large quantity of fresh lard or dripping, 
Jjoil it, and immediately slip the fish into it ; do t[)em of 
a fine brown. See to fry, page 12. 

Soles that have been fried eat good cold with oil, vine- 
gar, salt, and mustard. 

Stewed Soks. 
Do as carp, page 11. 

Soks another way. 
Take two or three soles, divide them from the back- 
Vope, and take off the head, fins, and tail. Sprinkle 
the inside with salt, roll them up tight from the tail end 
T^pwards, and fasten with small skewers. If large or 
middling, put half a fish in each roll ; small do not an- 
swer. Dip them into yolks of eggs^ and cover thenj 
with crumbs. Do the egg over them again, and then 
put more crumbs ; and fry them a beautiful colour in 
^d, or for fast-day in claxified butter. 

SoUm in the Portuguese way. 
Take one large or two small : if large, cut the fish in 
two; if small, they need only be split. The bones be- 
ing taken out, put the fish into a patn with a bit of but- 
fer and some lemon-juice, give it a fry, then lay the 
fish on a dish, aud spread a forcemeat over each piece, 
and roll it round, fastening the roll with a few small 
skewers. Lay the rolls into a small earthen pan, beat 
an egg and wet them, then strew crumbs over ; and put 
the remainder of the egg, with a little meat gravy, a 
spoonful of caper-liquor, an anchovy chopped fine, and 
some parsley chopped, into the bottom of the pan i

FISH. 17 

XELS. 

Spitckcock Eeh. 
Take one or two large eels, leave the skin on, cut 
them into pieces of three inches long, open them on the 
belly side, and clean them nicely : wipe them dry, and 
then wet them with beaten egg, and strew over on both 
sides chopped parsley, pepper, salt, a very little sage^ 
iod a bit of mace pounded fine and mixed with the sea* 
xning. Rub the gridiron v^ith a bit of tueti and broU 
. tbe fish of a fine colour. 

Serre with anchovy and butter for sauce. 

FHed Eels, 
If small, they should be curled round and fried, being 
&^ dipped into egg and crumbs of bread. 

BoiUd Eel*. 

The small ones are best : do them in a small quaotkj 
of water, with a good deal of parsley, which should be 
Krved up. with them and the liquor. 

Serve chopped parsley and butter for sauce. 

£el Broth, very nauriihing for the sick. 
Do aasbove ; but stew two hours, and add an onioa 
and pepper-corns : salt to taste. 

Collared Eel 

Bone a large eel, but don't skin it : mix pepper, salt, 
ii^ace, allspice, and a clove ort^6, in the finest powder, 
and rub over the whole innde; roll it tight, and bind 
with a coarse tape. Boil in salt and water till enough, 
then add vinegar, and when cold keep the collar in 
pickle. Serve it either whole or in slices. Chopped 
s^g^y parsley, and a little thyme; knotted marjoram, 
and savoury, mixed with the' spices, greatly improve 
the taste. 
^ To'stew Lamprey as at Worcester. 

After cleaning the fish carefully, remove the cartilage 
which runs down -the back, and season with a small 
quantity of cloves, mace, nutmeg, pepper, and all- 
spice ; put it into a small stew-pot, with very ^U<m%

beef gravy, port, and an equal quantity of Madeira, or 
sherry. 

It must be covered close ; stew till tender, then take 
out the lamprey and keep hot, while you boil up the 
liquor with two or three anchovies chop|)ed, and some 
flour and butter; strain the gravy through a sieve, and 
add lemon-juice and some made mustard. Serve will 
sippets of bread and horse-radish. 

Eels, done tlie same way, are a good deal like tbe 
lamprey. When there is spawn, it must b.e fried ao4 
put round. 

Note» Cyder will do in common instead of whit^ 
wine. 

FLOUND£&S» 

Let them be rubbed with salt inside and out* and tie 
two hours to give them some firmness. Dip them into 
^SSf cover with crumbs, and fry them. 

Heater Souehy, 

Stew two or three flounders, some parsley-leaves airf 
roots, thirty pepper-corns, and a quart of water, till tb< 
fish are boiled to pieces ; pulp them through a sieve. Sd 
over the fire tlie pulped fish, the liquor that boiled themj 
some perch, tench, or flounders, and some frfeh leaveii 
and roots of parsley ; simmer all till done enough, then 
serve in a deep dish. Slices of bread and butter are tc 
be sent to table, to eat with the souchy. 

HERRINGS fir/l(2 SPRATS. 

To Smoke Herrings, 

Clean, and lay them in salt and a little saltpetre oiu 
night ; then hang them on a stick*, through the eyes, ii 
a row. Have ready an old cask, on which put sQmi 
sawdust, and in the midst of it a heater red-hot ; fix (h^ 
stick over the smoke, and let them remain twenty-fouj 
hours. . 

• Fried Herrings, 

Serve them of a light , brown, with onions sliced anc 
fried. 



Broiled Herrings, 
Flour them first, and do of a good colour: plain but- 
ler for sauce. 

. Potted Herrings 
• Are very good done like Mackerel, seepage A3, 
,.g Tq dress Red H€rrings, 

Choose those that are large and moist, cut them open, 
and pour some boiling small beer over them to soak half 
a hour; drain them dry, and make them just hot through 
Wore the fire, then rub some cold butter over them and 
serve. Egg-sauce, or buttered eggs and mashed pota- 
toes, should be sent up with them. 

Baked Herrings or Sprats, 
Wasly and drain without wiping them ; season with 
allspice in £ne powder, salt, and a few whole cloves ; 
kj tbem in a pan with plenty of black pepper, an onion, 
aod a few bay-leaves. Add half vinegar and half small 
Wr, enough to cover them. Put paper over the pan, 
and bake in a slow oven. If you like, throw saltpetre 
over them the night before, to make them look red. 
Gut, but do not open them. 

' Sprats 

When cleaned, should be fastened in rows by a skewer 
run through the heads, and then broiled and served hot 
and hot. 

LOBSTERS and SHBIMPS. 

To pot Lobsters. 
Half-boil them, pick out the meat, cut it into small 
bits, season with mace, white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, 
press close into a pot and cover with butter, bake half 
an hour ; put the spawn in. When cold take the lobster 
out, and put it into the pots with a little of the butter. 
Beat the other butter in a mortar with some of the spawn; 

Mn mix that coloured butter with as much as will be 
iicient to cover the pots, and strain it. Cayenne may 
be added, if approved. 

Another vmy to pot Lobsters, as at Wood*s Hotel. 
Take out the meat as whole as you can ; s^lit l\i^ V-^^V

and remove the gut ; if the inside be not watery, a.cf d 
that. Season with mace, nutmeg, white pepper, sa.it, 
and a clove or two, in the finest powder. lay a little 
fine butter at the bottom of the pan, and the lobster 
smooth over it, with bay-leaves between ; cover it witli 
butter, and bake gently. When done, pour the whole 
en the bottom of a sieve ; and with a fork lay the pieces 
into potting-pots, some of each sort, with the seasoning 
about it. W hen cold, pour clarified butter over, but 
not hot. It will be good next day ; or highly seasoned^ 
and thick covered with butter, will keep some time. 

Potted lobster may be used cold, or as a fricassee, 
with a cream-sauce : it then looks very nicely and eats 
excellently, especially if there is spawn. 

Mackerel, Herrings, and Trout, are good potted as 
above. 

Stettfed Lobster, a very high Relish. 

Pick the lobster, put the bentes into a dish that hSs 
s lamp, and rub them down with a bit of butter, two 
spoonfuls of any sort of gravy, •ne of soy, or walnut-

To stew Oytters. 

Open and separate the liquor from them, then wash 
them from the grit ; strain the liquor, and put with the 
ousters a bit of mace and lemon-peel, and a few white 
peppers. Simmer them very gently^ and put some,- 
cream, and 'a little flour and butter. 

Serve with sippets. 

Boiled Oysters 

Eat well. Let the shells be nicely cleaned first ; and 
serve in them, to eat with cold butter. 

To scallop Oysters, 

Put them with crumbs of bread, pepper, salt, nutmeg* 
and a bit of butter, hito scallop-shelts or saucers, and 
bake before the fire in a Dutch oven. 

Fried Oysters, to garnish boiled Fi4h, 

Make a batter of flour, milk, and eggs, season it ^ 
very little, dip the oysters into it, and fry them a fin^ 
yellow-brown. A little nutmeg should be put into th^ 
seasoning, and a few crumbs of bread into the flour. 

Oyster Sauce, 
See Sauces. 

Oyster Loaves,

the oysters a few minutes in the liquor, then put them in 
small jars, and boil the pickle up> skim it, and when cold, 
pour over tlie oysters : cover close. 

Another way to pickle Oysters. 

Open the number you intend to pickle, put them into 
asauce-pan with their own liquor for ten minutes, simmer 
tl^em very gently ; then put them into ajar, one by one, 
that uone of the grit may stick to them, and cover tlieni 
vheo cold with the pickle thus made. — Boil the liquor 
vhh a bit of mape, lemon-peel, and black peppers, and 
to every hundred put two spoonfuls of the best undis- 
tilled vinegar. 

They should be kept in small jars, and tied close with 
hladder, for the air will spoil them.

MEATS. 

To choose Meats, 

f^cnison, — If the fot be clear, bright, and thick, and 
Ae cleft part smooth and close, it is young ; but if the 
cleft is wide and tough, it is old. To judge of its sweet- 
ness, run a very sharp narrow knife into the shoulder or 
haunch, and you will know by the scent. Few people 
liie it when it has much of the haut-gout. 

Serf, — If the flesh of ox-beef is young, it will have a 
£ne smooth open grain, be of a good red, and feel ten- 
der. The fat should look white rather than yellow ; for 
when that is of a deep colour, the meat is seldom good : 
beef fed by oil-cakes is in general so, and the flesh is 
flabby. The grain of cow-beef is closer, and the fat 
vMter, than that of ox-beef; but the lean is not of so 
bright a«ed. The grain of bull-beef is closer still, the 
fat hard and skinny, the lean of a deep red, and a

When sirloins of beef, or loins of veal or mutton, come 
In, part of the suet may be cut off for puddings, or to 
clarify. 

Dripping will baste every thing as well as butter, ex- 
cept fowls and game ; and for kitchen pies, nothing eke 
should be used. 

The fat of a neck or loin of mutton makes a far lighter 
pudding than suet. 

Meat and vegetables that the frost has touched,* should 
be soaked in cold water two or tiiree hours before used, 
or more if they are much iced. Putting them into hot 
water, or to the fire, till thawed, makes it impossible for 
any heat to dress them properly afterwards. 

In warm weather, meat should be examined well WheM 
it comes in ; and if flies have touched it, the part must be 
cut off, and then well washed. In the height of summer, 
it is a- very safe way to let meat that is to be salted lie an 
hour in very cold water, rubbing well any part likely to 
have been fly-blown ; then wipe it quite dry, and ha;ve 
salt ready, and rub it thoroughly in every part, throwing a 
handful over it besides. Turn it every day, and rub the 
pickle in, which will make it ready for the table in three 
er four days. If to be very much corned, wrap it in a well* 
floured cloth, after rubbing it with salt This last method 
will corn fresh beef fit for the table the day it comes in, 
but it must be put into the pot when the water boils. 

If the weather permit, meat eats much better for hang* 
ing two or three days before it is salted. 

The water in which meat has been boiled makes an 
excellent soup for the poor, by adding to it vegetables, 
oatmeal, or peas. 

Boast-beef-bones, or shank-bones of ham, make fine 
peas-soup ; and should be boiled with the peas the day 
before eaten, that the fat may be taken off. 

In some families great loss is sustained by the spoiling 
of meat- The best way to keep what is to be eaten un- 
galted, is, as before directed, to examine it well, wipe it 
every day, and put some pieces of charcoal over it. If meat 
it brought torn a distance in warm weatheri the butcher

tbould be ordered to cover it cloie, and bring it earl j m 
the morning; but even then, if it is kept on tbt road 
while he serves the customers, who live nearest to him, it 
will very likely be fly-blown. This happens often in the 
country. 

Wash all meat before you dress it : if for boiling, the 
colour will be better for soaking; but if for roasting, dry it. 

Boiling in a well-floured cloth will make meat white. 

Paiticular care must be taken that the pot is well skim- 
med the moment it boils, otherwise the foulness will be 
drspcised over the meat. The more soups or broth are 
skimmed, the better and cleaner they will be. 

The boiler and utensils should be kept delicately clean. 

Put the meat into cold water, and flour it well first 
Meat boiled quick vi^ill be hard ; but care must be taken 
that in boiling slow it does not stop, or the meat will be 
underdone. " 

If the steam is kept in, the water will not lessen much ; 
™fr«fore when you wish it to boil away, take off the cover 
«f the soup- pot. 

Vegetables should not be dressed with the meat^ except 
^**»^ or parsnip^ with boiled beef. 

As to ttieieitgtli of time required for roasting and boil- 
^ti* 9^ of the joint must direct ; as dso the strength 

^tltt fife, the nearness of the meat to it, and in boiling, 

twfCiflllar Uie«igh d<iw progress it makes ; for if the cook , 

VBea told to hinder the copper from boiling quick, lets it 

*<'pfro«hollfjlg up at all, the usual time will not be suf- 

£c'ieB^>xit(l the meat will be underdone, 
^^gh th* meat ; and allow for all solid joints, a quarter 

^Whww^or every pound, and some minutes (from ten 

^ twenty) over, according as the family like it done,

3^ nOMESTIC COOKEUT. 

A leg of porkf or of Umh, takes the Ailt a]lowatit:e tiff 
twenty roinuttt, above a quarter of an hoiir to a pound. 

In roasting, beef of ten pounds will take above tw* 
hours and a half; twenty pounds will take three iMiuv 
and three quarters. 

A neok of mutton will take an hour and a half, if liept 
at a proper distance. A chine of pork, two hours. 

The meat should be put at a good distaoce finm liie 
fire, and brought gradually nearer when the inner put 
becomes hot^ whi<^ will prevent its being soorohed whiie 
yet raw« Meat should be much basted ; and when iieariy^ 
done, floured to make it look frothed. 

Veal and mutton should have a little paper p«it over the 
fad. to preserve it If not fat enough to allow for basting, 
^ little good dripoing answers as well as butter. 

The cook should be careful not to run the spit throng 
the best parts ; and should observe that it be well cleaned 
1)efore and at the time of serving, or a black stain appears 
on the meat, in many joints the spit will pav Into the 
bones, and run along them for some distsMic^ so as not to 
injure the prime of the meat: and the cook shoitkl have 
leaden skewers to balance it with; for want of whioii, 
i|poiant servants are ofien troubled at the time of servkig. 

In roasting meat it is a very good way to put a little aa^ 
and water into the dripping-pan, and baste for a little while 
with this^ before using its own fat or dripping. Wiieik dry, 
dust it with flour, and baste aa usual. 

Salting meat before it is pot to roast drawa out tho' 
gravy: it should only be sprinkled when aJmosI done. 

Time, distanee, basting often, and a dear fire of a pro- 
per suse for what is required, are the first articles ai a good 
cook's attention in coasting. 

Q}d m^eats.do not require so much dstssiiig as yonog ; 
not that they are sooner done, but they can be eaten wkh 
Uif gravy more in.

Whta 70U wish fried tbiags to look as wdt as possible, 
^oihem twice over with egg and crumbs. Bread that it 
sot stale enough to grate quite fine, will not look well. 
The ht you fry in must always be boiling hot the moment 
the meat^ fkhj 8ic. are put in, and kept so till iinished; a 
imaU quantity never fries well. 

To keep meat 1wti-^\t is best to take it up when done, 
though the con^>any may not be come; set the dish over 
skfOD of boiling water, put a deep cover over it so as not 
to touch the meat, and then throw a cloth over that This 
way will not dry up the gravy. 

VENISON. 

To keep Venison. 

Preserve the venison dry, wash it with milk and water 
wy eleaiii and dry it with clean cloths till not the least 
top remains^ then dust pounded ginger over every 
pvt; which is a good preventative against the fly. By thus 
Aaaagiug and watcfcdng, it will hang a fortnight When 
^be usedf wash it with a little lukewarm water^ and dry 
it Pepper is likewise good to keep it 

To dre$i Venison, 
A haviich of buck wiU take three hours and a half, or 
three quarters roast'mg : doe, only three hours and a quar^ 
tv. Venisoa should be rather under than overdone. 

Spreski a sheet of white paper with butter, and put it 
over the ^, first sprhikling it with a little salt ; then lay 
a coarse paste on strong paper, and cover the haui>ch ; 
tie it with fine packthread, and set it at a distance from 
. the fire, which must be a good one. Baste it often ; ten 
minutes before serving take off the paste^ draw the meat 
nearer the fire, and baste it witti butter and a good deal 
of flour, to make it froth up well. ' 

Gravy for it should be put into a boat, and not into the 
dish (unless there is none in the venison), and made thus : 
Cut off the fat from two- or three pounds of a loin of old 
mutton, and set in steaks qd a gridiron for a few minutes 
juit to browftoae side; put them into a sauce-pan with a 
quaitof water, cover quite close for an hour, aud simmer

it gently ; then uncover it, and stew till the graty is r^ 
4luced to a pint. Season with only salt. 
Currant-jelly sauce must be served in a boat 
Formerly pap-sauce was eaten with venison ; which* as 
sftme still like it, it may be necessary to direct Grate 
white bread, and boil it with port wine, water, and a large 
stick of cinnamon ; and when quite smooth take out the 
cinnamon and add sugar. Claret may be used for it 

Make the jelly-sauce thus. Beat some currant-jelly 
and a spoonful or two of port wine,and set it over the fire 
till melted. Where jelly runs short put more wine, and 
a few lumps of sugar, to the jelly, and melt as above. 
Serve with French beans. 

Haunch, Neck, and Shoulder, qf Veniion. 
Roast with paste as directed above, and the same sauce. 

To stew a Shoulder qf Fenison. 

Let the meat hang till you judge ppoper to dress it ; the^ 
take out the bone, beat the meat with a rolling-pin, U/ 
some si ices of mutton-fat, that have lain a few hours in ^ 
little port wine, among it, sprinkle a little pepper and alt*'' 
spice over it in line powder, roll it up tight, and tie it. Se^ 
it in a stew-pan that will only just hold it, with sonie mnttol^ 
or beef gravy not strong, half a pint of poet wine, and som^ 
pepper and allspice. Simmer it close covered, and as slow ' 
as you can, fur three or four hours. When quite tender, 
take off the tape, set the meat on a dish, and strain the 
gravy over it. Serve with currant-jelly sauce. 

. This is the best way to dress this joint, unless it is very 
fat, and then it should be roasted. The bone should be 
stewed with it. 

Breast of Venison, 

Do it as the shoulder, or make it into a small pasty. 

Hashed Venison 

Should be warmed with its owp gravy, or some without 
seasoning, as before; and o^^ warmed through, not 
boiled, if there is no fat left/<TOt «p|he slices of mutton-

BEEF. 



To keep Beef. 

The butcher should take out the kernels in the neck- 
pieces where the shoulder-clod is taken off, two from each 
round of beef; one in the middle* which is called the 
pope's-eye; the other from the flap: there is also one in 
the thick flank, in the middle of the hi. If these are not 
taken out, especially in the summer, salt will be of no use 
for keeping the meat sweet. There is another kernel be- 
tween the rump and the edgebone. 

As the butchers seldom attend to this matter, the cook 
should take out the kernels ; and then rub the salt well 
ifito such beef as is for boiling, and slightly sprinkle that 
whieh is for roasting. 

The flesh of cattle that are killed when not perfectly 
cleared of food, soon spoils. They shou Id fast twenty -four 
houn m winter, and double that time in summer, befort 
being kilicd. 

To salt Beef or Pork for eating immediately. 
*^e piece should'not weigh more than ^wt or six pounds. 
Salt it very thoroughly just before you put it into the pot ; 
take a coarse cloth, flour it well, put the meat ip, aud fold 
it up close, Put it into a pot of boiling water, and boil it 
^ long as you would any other salt beef of the same size, 
^nd it will be as salt as if done four or five days. 

Great attention is requisite in salting meat : and in the 
country, where large quantities arc cured, this is of particu- 
lar impoi-tance. Beef and pork should be well sprinkled, 
and a f?w hours afterwards hung to drain, before it is rub- 
bed with the salt ; which method, by cleansing the meat 
from the blood, serves to keep it from tasting strong. It 
should be turned every day ; and if wanted soon, should 
be rubbed as often. A salting-tub or lead may be use4, 
and a cover to fit close. Those who use a good deal af

salt meat will find it answer well to boil up the picJcU, 
skim It, and when cold, pour it over meat th^t b^ b«e|i 
sprinkled and drained. Salt is soj^ucb increased in prlc^, 
Irom the heavy duties, as to xequire great care in usiog 
it ; and the brine ought not to be thrown away, as is the 
practice of some^ after once using. 

To salt Serf red: tvhich is extremely ^ood to tat Jresh

pon^le for leveral hours, till quite tender. Clear offtfao 
fat: and add to the gravy half a pint of port wine, a glas9 
of vinegar, and a large spoonful of ketchup ; simn^er half 
an hour, and serve m sl deep dish. Half a pint of table- 
beer may be added. The herbs to be used should be 
burnet, tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil,, savoury, marjo- 
ram, pennyroyal, knotted maijoram, and some chives if 
you can get them> but observe to proportBon the quantities 
to the pungency of the several sorts ; let there be a good 
handful altogether. 

Garnish with carrots, tumip9> or truffles and morels, 
or pickles of different colours, cut small, and laid in little 
heaps separate ; chopped parsley, chives, beet-root, &c. 
If, when done, the gravy is too much to fill the dish, take 
only a pait to season for serving, but the less water the 
better ; and to increase the richness, add a few becf-boney 
and sbanl» of mutton in stewing. 

A spoonful or two of made mustard is a great improve- 
ment to the gravy. 

Rump roasted is excellent ; but in the country it is.ge*- 
nerally sold whole with the edgebone, or cut across in- 
stead of lengthways as in London, where one piece is for 
boiUng, and the rump for stewing or roasting. This must 
. be attended to, the whole being too large to dress together. 

Stewed Rump another way. 

Half roast it; then put it into a large pot with three 
pints of water, one of small-beer, one of port wine, some 
salt, three or four spoonfuls of vinegar, two of ketchup, a 
bunch of sweet herbs of various kinds (such as burnet^ 
tarragon, parsley, thyme, basil, savoury, pennyroyal, mar- 
joram, knotted marjoram, and a leaf or two of sage), 
some onions, cloves, and Cayemie ; cover it close, and 
simmer till quite tender: two or three hours will do \U 
When done lay it into a d<iep dish, set it over hot water*! 
and covec it close. I^im the gravy^ put in a few pickled 
mushrooms, truffles, morels, and oysters if agreeable, but 
itis very good without; thicken the gravy with flour and 
butter, and heat it witfi the above, and pou^ over the 
beef. Forceroeat-baIl» of veal, anchovies, bacon> suet. 



Wbs, spice, bread, and egg^, to bind, are a great in* 

provement. 

To sietv Brisket ofBtrf. 
Put the part that has the hard fat mto a stew-pot with a 
small quantity of water: let it boil up, and akim it tho- 
roughly ; then add carrots^ turnips, onions, celery, and 
a few pepper-corns. Stew till extremely tender; then 
take out the flat bones, and remove all the fat from the 
soup. Either serve that and the meat in a tureen ; or the 
soup alone, and the meat on a dishi garnished with some 
vegetables. The following sauce is much admired, serv- 
ed with the beef: — ^Take half a pint of the soup, and mix 
it with a spoonful of ketchup, a glass of port wine, a tea- 
spoonful of made mustard, a little flour,' a bit of butter, 
and salt: boil all together a few minutes, then pour it 
round the meat. Chop capers, walnuts, red cabbage, 
pickled cucumbers, and chives or parsley, small, and put 
in separate he^ps over it. 

To press Berf, 

Salt a bit of brisket, thin part of the flank, or the topt 
of the ribs, with salt and saltpetre five days, then boil it 
gently till extremely tender: put it under a great weight 
or in a cheese- press, till perfectly cold. 

It eats excellently cold, and for sandwiches.

To stexv Tongue. 

Salt a tongue with saltpetre and common salt fori

Hash with the same, and port wine. 

Stewed Ox-cheek, plain. 

Soak and cleanse a fine cheek the day before it is to be 
eaten; put it into a stew-pot that will cover close, with 
three quarts of water; simmer it after it has first boiled 
up and been well skimmed. In two hours put plenty of 
carrots, leeks, two or three turnips, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, some whole pepper, and four ounces of allspice. 
Skim it often; when the meat is tender, take it out; let 



ftfioup get cold, take off the cake offal, and s«rve the 

soup separate or with the meat. 
It should be of a fine brown: which may be done by 

burnt sugar ; or by frying some onions quite brown with 
flour, and simmering them with it. This last way im« 
proves the flavour of all soups and gravies of the brown 
iind. 

If vegetables are not approved in the soup, they may 
be taken out, and a small roll be toasted, or bread fried 
md added. Celery is a great addition, and should al- 
ways be served. Where it is not to be got, the seed

To dress an Ox-cheek another way. 
Soak half a head three hours, and clean it with plenty 
of water. Take the meat off the bones, and put it into a 
pan with a large onion, a bunch of sweet herbs, some 
bruised allspice, pepper, and salt. 

Lay the bones on the top; ponr-on two or three quarts 
w ^ater, and cover the pan close with brown paper, or a 
1^ dish that will fit close. Let it stand eight or ten hours in 
i « slow oven ; or simmer it by the side of the fire, or on a. 
• bot hearth. When done tender, put the meat into a clean 
i pan, and let it get cold. Take the cake of fat off, and

The first part that turns bad of a leg of veal, is wh«ve 
the udder is skewered back. The skower should be 
taken out, and both that and the part under it wiped every 
day, by which means it will keep gopd three or four day* 
in hot weather. Take care to cut out the pipe tliat runs 
along the chine of a loin of veal, at you do of beef, to 
hinder it from taiotiog. The skirt of the breast of veal is 
likewise to be taken off; and the inside of the breast.

K% few people «e fond of boiled veal, it may be well 
9 leave the luiiidtle small, and take off some cutlets or 
olk>ps before it be dressed ; but as the knuckle will keep 
Mger than the fillet, it is best not to cut ofT the slices till 
mnted. Break the bones, to make it take less room ; 
mh it well ; and put it into a saucerpan with three onions, 
t bbde of mace or two, and a few pepper-corns ; cover 
t with water, and, simmer till quite ready. In the mean 
UK some macaroni shouFd be boiled widi it if approved, 
orice, or a little rice fiour, to give it a small degree of 
ttaekiiess ; but don't put too much. Before it is served, 
add half a pint of milk and cream, and let it come up 
either with or without the meat. 

Or fry the knuckle with sliced onion and butter to 
4 good brown ; and have ready peas, lettuce, onion, and 
acucumber or two, stewed in a small quantity of water

Beat is tender enough to eat, but not overdone. Throw 
it- pepper, salt, and a bit lof shred mint, and serve allto-

orange or lemon-juice into it. *j 

Breast qf Veal, . i 

Before roasted, if large, the two ends may be taken off \ 
and fried to stew, or the whole may be roasted. Butter \ 
should be poured over it. 

If any be left, cut the pieces into handsome sizes, put \ 
them into a stew-pan, and pour some broth over it; or if 
you have no broth, a little water will do : add a bunch 
of herbs, a blade or two of mace, some pepper, and aa 
anchovy ; stew till the rheat is tender, thicken with butter 
and flour, and add a little ketchup ; or the whole breast 
may be stewed, after cutting off the two ends. 

Serve the sweetbread whole upon it : which may either 
be stewed; or parboiled, and then covered with crumbSt 
herbs, pepper, and salt, and browned in a Dutch-oven.

Cutlets Afaintenon. 
Cut slices about three quarters of an inch thick, beat 
them with a roUing-pin, and wet them on both sides with 
egg : dip them into a seasoning of bread-crumbs, parsLej, 
thyme, knotted marjoram, pepper, salt, and a little nut- 
meg grated ; then put tliem into papers folded over, and 
broil them ; and hiive iu a boat melted butter, with a 
little mushroom 'ketchup. 

Cutlets another xuay. 

Prepare as above, and fry them ; lay them into a dish, 
vd keep them hot; dredge 4 little flour, and put a bit 
ef butter ini* the pan ; brown it, then pour a little boil- 
ihf water Ints it, and boil quick: mmM with pepper,

Other viat/s. — Prepare -as before, and dress the cutlets 
in a Dutch-oven ; pour over them melted butter and 
mushrooms. 

Or, pepper, salt, and broil them, especially neck- 
itteJts. They are excellent without herbs. 

Feal CoUops. 
Cut long thin collops ; beat them well ; and lay on 
them a bit of thin bacon of the same size, and spread 
forcemeat on that, seasoned high, and also a little gar- 
lick and Cayenne. Roll tl^m up tight, about the size 
of two fingers, but not more 4lian two or three inches 
Jang ; put a very small skewer to fasten each firmly ; 
rub egg over ; fry them of a fine brown, and pour a rich 
brown gravy over. 

To dress Collops quick. 
Cut them as thin as paper with a very sharp knife, 
and in small bits. Throw the skin, and any odd bits of 
the veal, into a little water, with a dust of pepper and 
salt ; set them on the fire while you beat the collops ; 
and dip them into a seasoning of herbs, bread, i>epper,

minutes will do them on both sides : put them into a hot 
dish before the fire ; then strain and thicken the gravy, 
give it a boil in the frying-pan, and pour it over the col- 
lops. A little ketchup is an improvement. 

Another war/, — Fry them in butler, only seasoned with 
salt and pepper; then simmer them in gravy, either 
white or brown, with bits of bacon served \¥ith them. 

If white, add lemon-peel and mace, and some cream. 

Scallops of cold Feal or Chicken, 
Mince the meat extremely small ; and set it over the 
fire with a scrape of nutmeg, a little pepper and salt, 
and a little cream, for a few minutes: then put it into 
the scallop-shells, and fill them with crumbs of breadf 
over which puC|paie bits of butter, and brown them be* 
fore the fire. 

Either veal or chicken looks and eats well prepared 
in this way, and lightly covered with crumbs of bread 
fried ; or these may be put on in little heaps. 

Fricandeau of Teal. 
Cut a large piece from the fat side of the leg, about 
nine inches long and half as thick and broad ; beat it 
with the rolling-pin ; take off the skin, and trim off the 
rough edges. Lard the top and sides; and cover it 
with fat bacon, and then with white paper. I^y it into 
the stew-pan with any pieces of undressed veal or mutton, 
four onions, a carrot sliced, a faggot of sweet herbs, 
four blades of mace, four bay-leaves, a pint of good 
veal or mutton broth, and four or five ounces of lean 
ham or gammon. Cover the pan close, and let it stew 
slowly three hours ; then take up the meat, remove all 
the fat from the gravy, and boil it quick to a glaze. 
Keep the fricandeau quite hot, and then glaze it; and 
serve with the remainder of the glaze in the dish, and 
sorrel-sauce in a sauce-tureen.

of your hand, and prepare it the same way as in the last 
teceipt: three or four bones only will be necessary, and 
they will make the gravy ; but if the prime part of the 
leg is cut off, it spoils the whole.

To hoii Calf's tfead. 

Clean it very nicely, and soak it in water, that it may 
look very \% hite ; take out the tongue to salt, and tb^ 
brains to make a little dish. Boil the head extrcmdjT 
tender; then strew it over with crumbs and choppc*^ 
parsley, and brown them; or, if liked better, leave on^ 
side plain, fiacon and greens are to be served to eai^

the head may be equally brown. In the mean time slice 

Hie remainder of the head and the tongue, but first peel 

the tongue ; put a pint of good gravy into a pan, with 

an onion, a small bunch of herbs (consisting of parsley, 

basil, savoury, taragon, knotted marjoram, and a little 

thyme,) a little salt and Cayenne, a shalot, a glass of

PORK, &c. 

Bacon-bogs and porkers, are differently cut up. 



PORK. 57 

Hogs are kept to a larger size ; the chine (or back- 
one) is cut down on each side, the whole lengtb> arid is 
prime part either boiled or roasted. 
The sides of the hog are made into bacon, and the in- 
je is cut out with very little meat to tlic bone. On 
ich side there is a large spare-rib ; which is usually di* 
ded into two, one sweet-bone and a blade-bone. The 
icon is the whole outside: and contains a fore-leg, and 
ham ; which last is the hind -leg, but if left with the 
con is called a gammon. Tliere are also griskins. 
og's lard is the inner fat of the bacon-liog. 
Pickled pork is made of the flesh of the bog, as well 
bacon. 

Porkers are not so old as hogs ; their flesh is whiter 
d less rich, but it is not so tender. It is divided into 
ir quarters. The fore-quarter has the spring or fore- 
r, the fore-loin or neck, the spare-nb and griskin. The 
id has the leg and the loin. 

The feet of pork make various good dishes, and 
mid be cut off before the legs are cured. Observe 
' same of the ears. 

The bacon-hog is sometimes scalded to take off the 
r, and sometimes singed. The porker is always 
Ided. 

To roast a Leg of Pork, 
Choose a small leg of fine young pork: cut a slit in 
knuckle with a sharp knife; and fill the space with 
e and onion chopped, and a little pepper and salt. - 
len half-done, score the skin in slices, but dqu't tut 
per than the outer rind. 
Lpple-sauce and potatoes should be served t<i eat with 

To boil a Leg of Pork, 
alt it eight or ten days: when it is to be dressed, 
gh it; let it lie half an hour in cold water to make 
hite ; allow a quarter of an hour for every pound,, 
half an hour over, from the time it boils up ; skim • 
( soon as it boils, and frequently after. Allow water -

boil it in a Tcry nice cloth, floured; which gives a very 
delicate look. It should be smatl and of a fine grain. 
Serrc pe^s-pudding and turnips with it. 

Loin and Neck of Pork. 
Koast them. Cut the skin of the loin across, at dis- 
tances of half an inch, with a sharp pen-knife. 

Shoulders and Breasts of Pork, 
Put them into pickle^ or salt the shoulder as a leg: 
when very nice, they may be roasted. 

Rolled Neck rf Pork. 

Bone it ; pet a forcemeat of chopped sage> a very few 
crumbs of bread, salt, pepper, snd two or three berries 
cf allspice, over the inside ; then roll the meat as tight 
as you can, and roast it slowly, and at a good distance 
at ^.rst. 

Spring or Forehand of Pork. 

Cut v.ut the bone; sprmkle salt, pepper, and sage 
dried, over the inside ; but first warm a little butter to 
baste it, and then flour it ; roll the pork tight, and tie it; 
then roast by a hanging jack. About two hours will 
do it 

Spare-rih 
Should be basted with a very little butter and a littl« 
liour, and then sprinkled with dried sage crumbled. 
Apple-sauce, and potatoes, for roasted pork. 

Pork Griskin 
Is usually very hard ; the best way to prevent this is, to 
put it iuto as much cold water as will cover it, and let it 
Doil up ; then instantly take it oif, and put it into a 
Dutch oven ; a very few minutes will do it. Reniem* 
ber to rub batter over it, and then flour it, before you 
put it to the fire. 

Blade-hone of Pork 
Is taken from the baconrhog ; the less meat left on it in 
moderation, the better, it vS to be broiled ; and whieB 
just done, pepper and salt it. Put to it a piece of fout- 
tefj and a tea-spoonful of mustard ; and serv^ it covered,

To dress Fork as Lamb, 
Kill a youDg pig of four or five oMNiths old; cut vp 
the fore-quarter for roasting as you do lainb, and truss 
the shank close. The other parti will make deiicate 
pickled pork ; or steaks, pies, &c. 

Pork Steaks. 
GmX them from a loin or neck, and of middling thick* 
ness ; pepper and broil them, turning them often ; when 
nearly done, put on salt, rub a bit of butter < ver, and 
ser^e the moment they are tuken oflf the fire, a few at a 
time. 

To pickle Pork. 

The quantities proportioned to the middlings of a pretty 
large heg, the hams and shoulders being cut off*. 

Mix, and pound fine, four ounces of saltpetre, • 
pound of coarse sug^, an ounce of sal-pruuel, and a 
little common salt: sprinkle the pork with salt, and 
drain it twenty-four hours: then rub with the above; 
pack the pieces tight in a small deep tub, iiUing up the 
spaces with common salt. Place large pebbles on the 
pork, to prevent it from swimming in the pickle which 
the salt will produce. If kept from air, it will continut 
very fine for t>vo years. 

Sausages, 
Chop fat and lean of pork together; season it witii 
sage, pepper, and salt, and you may add two or three 
berries of allspice : half Jill hog's guts that have been 
»oaked and made extremely clean : or the meat may be 
kept in a very small pan, closely covered ; and so roiled 
ai\d dusted with a very littl^ flour before it is fri^d. 

[Serve on stewed red cabbage ; or mash potatoes put la 
a form, brown with salamander, and garnisi with the 
above ; they must be pricked with a fork br ore they 
are dressed, or they will burst.

Have ready an ox>guttbat has been scoured, salted, and 
soaked^' ell, and iilUt with the above stuifing ; tie up 
the ends, and hang it^o sraoke as you would hams^ but 
fii-st wrap it in a fold or two of old muslin. It must be 
high-dried. Some- eat it without boiling, but others 
like it boiled first. The skin should be tied in ditTierent 
places, so as to make each link about eight or nine inches 
long. 

Spadhurifs Oj^rd Sausages, 
Chop a pound and a half of pork, and the same of 
veal, cleared of skin and sinews ; add three quarters of 
a pound of beef-suet ; mince, and mij^ them ; steep the 
crumb of a penny-loaf in water, and mix it with the 
meat, with also a little dried sage, pepper, and salt. 

To scald a Sucking Pig, 
The moment the pig is killed, put it into cold water 
for a few minutes ; then rub it over with a little resin 
t>eliten extremely small, and put it into a pail of scald- 
ing water half a minute : take it out, lay it on a table, 
and pull off the hair as quickly as possible; if any part 
does not come off, put it in again. When quite clean, 
wash it well with warm water, and then m two or three 
cold waters, that no flavour of the resin may remain. 
Take off all the feet at the first joint; make a slit down 
^the belly, and take out the entrails ; put the liver, heart, 
and lights, to the feet. Wash the pig well in cold water, 
dry it thoroughly, and fold it in a w^et cloth to keep it 
from the air. 

To roast a Sucking Pig, 
If you can get it when just killed, this is of great ad- 
vantage* Lcrt it be scalded, which the dealers usually 
do; then put some sage, crumbs of bread, salt, and 
pepper, into the belly, and Sew it up. Observe to 
skewer the legs back, or the under part will not crisp. 

Lay it to a 'brisk fire till thoroughly dry ; then have 

ready some butter in a dry cloth, and rub the pig with

the head while at the tire ; take iNIt the brains, and mit 

them with the gravy that cemes from the pig. Then 

take it up ; and without withdrawing the spit, cut it 

down the back and belly, lay it into the dish, and chop 

the sage and bread quickly as Ane as you can, and mix 

them with a large quantity of fine melted butter that has 

very little flour. Put the sauce into the dbh after the 

pig has been split clown the back, and garnished with the 

ears and the two jaws ; take off the upper part of the head 

down to the snout. 

In Devonshire it is served whole, ifi very small ; the 
head only being cut olf, to garnish a& above. 

Pettitocr. 

Boil them, the liver, and the heart, in a small quantity 
of water, very gently ; then cut the meat iMc» and sim« 
mer it with a little of the water and the feet split, till the 
feet are quite tender ; thicken with a bit of butter, a little 
flour, a spoonful of cream, and a little salt and pepper ; 
give it a boil up, pour k over a few sippets of bread, and 
put the feet on the mince. 

To make excellent Meat of a Hog*s Head, 

Split the head, take out the brains, cut off the ears, 
and sprinkle it with common salt for a day ; then drain 
h: salt it well with common salt and saltpetre three days, 
then lay the salt and head into a small, quantity of water 
for two days. Wash it, and boU till all the bones will 
come out ;' remove them, and chop the head as quick as 
possible ; but first skin the tongue, and take the skin 
carefully off the head, to put under and over. Season 
with pepper, salt, and a little mace or allspice^berries. 
Put the skin into a.small pan, press the cut head In, and 
put the other skin over ; press it down. When cold, it 
will turn out, and make a kind of brawn. If too fat, you

the liquor for a pickle to keep it 

To rofisf Porker* s Head. 
Choose a fine young head, clean it well, and put bread 
and sage as for pig ; sow it up tight, and on a string or 
hanging jack roast it as a pig, and serve with the same 
•auce. 

To prepare Pig's Cheek for boiling. 
Cut off the snout, and clean the head ; divida it, and 
take out the eyes and the brains ; sprinkle the head with 
salt, and let it drain twenty-four hours. Salt it with 
common salt and saltpetre: let it lie eight or ten da3's if 
to be dressed without stewing with peas, but less if ta be 
dressed with peas ; and it must be washed £rst, and then 
simmered till all is tender. 

To collar Pig^s Head. 

Scour (he head and ears nicely ; take off the hair and 
snout, and take out the eyes and the brain; lay it into 
water one night ;.then drain, salt it extremely well with 
common salt and saltpetre, and let it lie five days, fioil 
it enough to take out the bones ; then lay it on a dresser, 
turning the thick end of one side of the head towards the 
thin end of the other to make the roll of equal size ; 
sprinkle it well with salt and white pepper, and roll it with 
the ears ; and if you approve, put the pig's feet round the 
outside when boned, or the thin parts of two cow-heels. 
Put it in a cloth, bind with a broad tape, and boil it till 
quite tender; then put a good weight upon it, and don't 
take off the covering till cold. 

If you choose it to be more like brawn, salt it longer, 
and let the proportion of saltpetre be greater, and put in 
also some pieces of lean pork ; and then cover it with 
cow-heel, to look like the horn. 

This may be kept either in or out of pickle of salt ttad 
water boiled, with vinegar; and is a very convenient 
thing to have in the house. 

if likely to spoil, slice aad fry it cither with or wUhoul 






To dry Ho§*s CkeeJcM. 
Cut out the snout, remove the brains, and split tbt 
heady taking off the upper bone, to make the chawl a 
good shape ; rub it well with salt ; next diy take away 
the br uie, and salt it again the follow iug day : cover the 
head with half an ounce of saltpetre, two ounces of bay- 
&alt, a Utile common salt, and four ounces of coarse 
sugar. Let the head be often turned ; after ten days* 
smoke it for a week Tike bacon. 

To force Ho^s Ears, 
Parboil two pair of ears, or take some that have been 
soused ; make a forcemeat of an anchovy, some sage, pars- 
ley, a quarter of a pound of suet chopped, bread-crumbs* 
.p«:ppt'r, and only a little salt. Mix all these with the 
yolks of two eggs; raise the skin of the upper side of 
the ears, and stuff them with the above. Fry the ears in 
fresh butter, of a fine colour; then pour away the fat» 
and drain them : make ready half a pint of rich gravy, 
with a glass of fine sherry, three tea-spoonfuls of made 
mustard, a little bit of flour and butter, a small onion 
vrhole^ and a little pepper or Cayenne. Put this with 
the ears into a stew-pan, and cover it close; stew it 
gently for half an hour, shaking the pan often. When 
done enough, take out the onion, place the ears care- 
fully in a dish, and pour the sauce over them. If a lar- 
ger dish is wanted, the meat from two feet may be added 
to the above. 

Different If ays of Dressing Pig's Feet and Ears. 
Clean carefully, and soak some hours, and boil thent 
tender; then take them out; boil some vinegar and a 
little salt with some of the water, and when cold put it 
over them. When they are to be dressed, dry them, 
cut the feet in 4wo, and slice the ears ; fry, and serve 
with butter, mustard, and vinegar. They may be either 
done in batter, or only floured,

Jclht of Pig's Feet and Ears. 
Ch;an and prepare as in the last article, then boil them 
In a very small quantity of water till every bone can be 
taken out; throw in naif a handful of chopped sage, the 
same of parsley, and a seasoning of pepper, salt, and 
nu.ce, in line powder; simmer till the herbs are scalded,, 
then pour the whole into a melon-form. 

Pig's HarsUt. 

Wash and dry some liver, sweetbreads, and fiat and 
lean bits of pork, beating the latter with a rolKng-pin to 
make it tender ; season with pepper, salt, sage, and a 
little onion shred fine; wlien mixed, put all into a cawl, 
and fasten it up tight with a needle and thread. Roast^ 
it on a hanging jack, or by a string. 

Or serve in siSces with parsley for a fry. 

Serve with a sauce of port -wine and water, and mus- 
tard, just boiled up, and put into tlie dish. 

Mock Brawn. 
Boil a pair of neat's feet very tender; take the meat 
off, and have ready the belly-piece of pork salted with* 
common salt and saltpetre for a week. Boll this almost 
enough ; take out any bones, and roll the feet and the 
pork together. I'hen roll it very tight with a strong 
cloth and coarse tape. Boil it till very tender,, then, 
hang it up in the cloth till cold ; after which keep it in 
a sousing-liquor, as is directed in the next article. 

Souse for Brawn, and for Pi^s Feet and Ears. 
Boil a quarter of a peck of wheat-bran, a sprig of 
bay, and a sprig of rosemary, in two gallons of water, . 
with four ounces of salt in it, for half an hour. Strain it, 
and let it get cold. 

To make Black Puddings. 
The blood must be stirred with salt till cold. Put a 
quart of it, or rather more^ to a quart of whole grils, to 



Mak one night ; and soak the crumb of a quartern l«af 

m ntber more than (wo quarts of new- milk matle hoi. 

h the mean time prepttre the guts by washing, turning, 

*nd scraping with salt and water, and changing the water 

•everal times. Chop fine a little wiuter-savoury and 

thyme^ a good quantity of pennyroyal, pepper, and palt, 

a few cloves, some allspice, ginger, andnuimeg: mix 

these witb three pounds of beef-suet, and six eggs well 

beaten and strained ; and tlien beat the bread, grits, &c* 

. all up with the seasoning : when well mixed, have ready 

some hogs* fat cut into large bits; and as you fill the 

skins, put it in at proper distances. Tie in links, only 

half filled ; and boil in a large kettle, pricking them as 

they swell, or they will burst. When boiled, lay them 

between clean cloths till cold, and hang them up in the 

kitchen. When to be used, scald them a few minutes in 

water, wipe and put them into a Dutch oven. 

If there are not skins enough, put the stuffing into ba- 
sins, and boil it covered with floured cloths ; and slice 
I and fry it when used. 

Another way, — Soak all night a quart of bruised grits 
^ ^n as much boiling- hot milk as will swell them and leave 
i half a pint of liquid. Chop a good quanitity of penny- 
royal, some savoury, and thyme ; salt, pepper, and alU 
5piGc; finely powdered. *Mix the above with a quart of 
the blood, prepared as before directed ; then half fill the 
skins, after they have been cleaned thoroughly, and put 
•as much of the leaf (that is, the inward fat) of the pig as 
wilV make it pretty rich. Boil as before directed. A 
small quantity of leeks finely shred and well mixed, is a 
great improvement. 

Anotlier ivay. — Boil a quart of half-grits in as much 
milk as will s\a eJI them to the utmost ; then drain them 
and add a quart of blood, a pint of rich cream, a pound 
of suet, some mace, nutmeg, alispice, and four cloves, 
alt in fine powder; two pounds of the hoofs leaf cut into 
dice, two leeks, a handful of parsley, ten leaves of sage, 
a large handful of penny -royal, and a sprig of thyme and 
knotted maijoram, all minced fine ; eight eggs weU

scalded with a pint of m ilk, ptpper, and salt. HaW fiU 
the skms; which must first be cleaned with the greatest 
care, turned several times, and soaked in several waters, 
and last in rose-water. Tie the skins in links,- boil arid 
prick them with a clean fork to prevent their bursting. 
Cover them with a clean cloth till cold. 

White Hog's Puddings. 
When the ^skios have been soaked and cleaned as be- 
fore directed, ruise and soak them all night in rose-water, 
and put intotiiem the following filling: Mix half a pound 
of blanched almonds cut Into seven or eight bits, wUb a 
pound of grated bread, two pounds of marrow or suet, a 
pound of currants, some beaten cinnamon, cloves, mace, 
and nutmeg, a quart of cream, the yolks of six and 
whites of two eggs, a little orange-flower water, a little 
fine Lisbon sugar, and somojenion-peel and citron, si iced, 
and half fill the skins. To know whether sweet enough, 
warm a little in a panikin. In boiling, much care must 
be taken to prevent the puddings from bursting. Prick 
them with a small fork as they rise, and boil them in milk 
and water. Lay theai in a table-cloth till cold. 

Hog's Lard 
Should be carefully melted in a jar put into a kettle of 
water, and boiled, run it into bladders that have4>een 
extremely well cleaned. The smaileFthey are, tlie bet- 
ter the lard keeps ; as after tlie air reaches it, it becomes 
rank. Put in a sprig of rosemary when melting. 

This being a most useful article for frying fish, it 
shoidd be prepared with care. Mixed with butter, it 
makes fine crust. 

To cure Hams, 

Hang them a day or two; then sprinkle them with a 
little salt, and drain them another day; pound an ounce 
and a half of saltpetre, the same quantity of bay-salt, 
half an ounce of sal-prunel, and a pound of the coarsest 
Augar. Mix these well ; and rub them into each ham 
every day for fowr days, and turn it. If a small one. 



MUTxas. 69 

Wash well, and put it into a boiler with |^enty of water ; 
i^t it simmer four, fire, or six hours, according to the 
size. When done enough, if befoiethe time of serving, 
<:oyer it with a cleauicloth doubled, and keep the dish 
Jiot over boiling water. Take off the skin, and stn^w 
raspings over the ham. Garnish with carrot. Preserve 
the skin as whole as possiMe, to keep over the ham when 
cpld^ which will prevent its drying. 

Excellent Bacon. 
Divide the hog, and take the chine out; it is common 
to remove the spare-ribs, but the bacon will be preserved 
better from being rusty if they are left in. Salt the ba- 
con six days, then drain it from that first pickle: mix as 
inuch salt as you judge proper with eight ounces of bay- 
salt, three ounces of saltpetre, and a pound of coarse 
sugar, to each hog, but first cut off the hams. Rub the 
safis well in, and turn it every day for a month. Draia, 
md snK>ke it a few days ; or dry without, by hanging in 
the kitchen, not near the fire. 

771^ tnanner of curing fTiltshire Bacon, 
Sprinkle each flitch with salt, and let the blood drain 
•off for twenty-four hours : then mix a pound and a half 
of coarse sugar, the same quantity of bay-salt, not quite 
80 much as half a pound of saltpetre, and a pound of 
common salt; and rub this well on the bacon, turning 
it every day for a month : then hang it to dry, and after- 
wards .smoke it ten days. This (juantity of salts is sufH- 
cient for the whole hog.

Observations on keeping and dressing ^futtQn, 
Take away the pipe that runs along the bone of the 
inside of a chine of mutton ; and if to be i<&ept a great 
time, rub the part close round the tail with salt, after 
first cutting out the keniet 

The kernel in the fat on the thick part of the leg 
should be taken out by the butcher, for it taints first 
there. The chine and rib-bones should be wiped every 
day ; and the bloody part of the neck be cut oif, to pre-

If roasted, serve with onion er currant-jelly sauce ; u

Neck qf Mutton 
Is particularly useful, as so many dishes irjay be made 
of it; but it is not advantageous for the ^^'^y\,/^^ 
bone; should be cut short, which the butchers will not 
do unless particularly desired. ^ , ., , ^. curved 

The best end of the neck may be boded, ^^^ ^^J^f

or harrico. ,• vv *» tmiL\\ 

The scrags may be stewed in broth; or with a small 
quantity of water, some small onions, a few pepper-corns 
and a little rice, and served together. 

When a neck is to be boiled to look particularly nice, 
saw down the chine-bone, strip the ribs half-way do wn> 
and chop off the ends of the bones about four »ncnes. 
The skin should not be taken off till boiled, and tUcn 
the fat will look the whiter. 

When there is more fat to a neck or loin of mutton, 
tlian it is agreeable to eat with the lean, it makes an un- 
commonly good suet-pudding, or crust for a meat-pie u 
cut very fine.

iSUTTON. 7t 

To dr€ss Haunch qfMuUon* 

Keep it as long as it can be pn served fweet by the 
different modes : let it be washed with waim milk and 
«ater, or vinegar, if necessary ; but when to be dressed, 
observe to wash it well. Jest the outaidc should have a 
bad flavour from keeping. Put a paste of coarse flour 
oil stroQg paper, and fold the haunch in : sot it at a great 
distance from the fire, and allow proportionable time f^r 
the paste ; don't take it off till about thirty-five or forty 
minutes before serving, and then baste it continually. 
Bring the haunch nearer to the fire before you take off 
the paste, and froth it up as you would venison. 

A gravy must be made of a pound and a half of loin of 
old mutton, simmered in a pint of water to half, and no 
seasoning but salt : brown it with a little burnt sugar, and 
send it up in the dish ; but there should be a good deal 
of gravy in the meat; for though long at the fire, the 
distance and covering will prevent its roasting out. 

Serve with currant-jelly sauce. 

To roast a Saddle of Mutton, 

I^t it be well kept first. Raise the skin, and then 
skewer it on again; take it off a quarter of an hour be- 
fore serving, sprinkle it with some salt, baste it, and 
dredge it well with flour. The rump should be split, and 
skewered back on each side. The joint may be Urge 
or small according to the company : it is the most ele- 
gant if the latter. Being broad it requires a high and 
strong fire, 

FUht of Mutton braised. 

Take off tlie chump end of the loin, butter some pa- 
per, and put over it, and then a paste as for venison ; 
roast it two hours. Don't let it be thei least brown. Have 
ready some French beans boiled and drained on a sieve ; 
and while the mutton is being glazed, give them one 
l^at-up in gravy, and lay tliem on the dish with the meat 
over them. 

Harrico,

them in their own fat of a fine light brown^ but not 
enough fot mating. Then put them into a dish while you 
fry the carrots, turnips, and onions ; the carrots and tur^ 
flips in dice, the onions sliced : but they must only be 
warmed, not browned, or you need not fry them. Then 
lay the steaks at the bottom of a stew-pan, the vegetables 
over them, and pour as much boiling water as will just 
cover them ; give one boil, skim w«U, and then set the 
pan on the side of the fire to simmer gently till tender. 
In three or four hours skim them ; and add pepper, salt, 
and a spoonful of ketchup. 

To flash Mvtton. 

Cut thin «lices of dressed mutton, fat and lean ; flour 
them ; have ready a little onion boiled in two or three 
spoonfuls of water ; add to it a little gravy and the meat 
seasoned, and make it hot, but not to boil.' Serve in a 
covered dish. Instead of onion, a clove, a spoonful of 
currant-jelly, and lialf a glass of port wine, will give an 
agreeable flavour of venison, if the meat be fine. 

Pickled cucumber, or walnut, cut small, warm in it 
for change. 

To boil Shoulder of Mutton with Oysters. 

Hang it some days, then salt it well for tyo days; 
bone it, and sprinkle it with pepper ami a bit of mace 
pounded : lay some oysters over tt and roll the meat up 
tight and tie it. Stew it in a small quantity of water, 
with an onion and a few pepper-corns, till quite tender. 

Have ready a little good gravy, and some oysters 
stewed in it; thicken tliis with flour and butter, and po<ir 
over the mutton when the tape is taken off. The 8t«w- 
pan should be kept close covered.

meat with ste1^'ed cucumbers ; or t» eat cold, covered 
with chopped parsley. Or half boil ipd then grill it be-

To roll Loin qf Mutton. 
Hang the mutton till tender ; bone it ; and lay a sea- 
soning of pepper, allspice, mace, nutm^ and a few 
cloves, ail in fine powder, over it. Next day prepare a 
stuffing as for hare ; beat the m<^at, and cover it with the

slow oven ; let it grow cold ; take of the iat, and put the 
gravy inio a stew-pan; flour the meat, and put it ia 

I likewise ; stew it till almost ready ; and add a glass of port 

j wine, some ketchup, an anchovy, and a little lemon- 
ptckle, half an hour before serving ; serve it in the gravy, 
and with jelly-sauce. A few fresh jDUshrooms are a great 

\ improvement; hut if to eat like hare do not use these» 
nor the lemon-pickle. 

^ Mutton Ham, 

Choose a iiiie grained leg of wether-mutton, of twelve 
or fourteen pounds weight; let it be cut ham-shape, and 
liang two days. Then put into a stew-pan half a pound 
of bay-salt, the same of common salt, two ounces of 
saltpetre, and half a pound of coarse sugar> all in pow* 
' (ler ; mix, and make it quite hot ; tbeii rub it well into 
the ham. Let it be turned in. the liquor every day ; at 

Fthe end of four days put twoi ounces more of common 
s^t; in twelve days take itr^i^ dry it, and hang it up 
in wood-smoke, a week. It is to be used in slices with 
stewed cabbage, mashed potatoes, or eggs. 

Mviton Collops, 
Take a loin of mutton that has been well hung; and 
cut from the part next the leg, some coUops very thin. 
Take out the sinews. Season the collops with salt, pep- 
per, and mace; and strew over them shred parsley, 
thyme, and two or three shalots? firy therfi in butter till 
half-done; add half a pint of gravy, a little juice of Ic-

Hie whole very gently dye minutes. They should be 
served immediately, or they will be hard. 

Mutton Cut^^sin the Portuguese xvay* 
Cut the chops ; and half-fry them with sliced shalot or 
onion, chopped parsley, and two bay-leaves ; season 
with pepper and salt : then lay a forcemeat on a piece of

leaving a hole for the end of tlie bones to go through. 
Broil on a gentle fire. Serve with sauce Robart ; or^ as 
the seasoning makes the cutlets high, a little gravy. 

Mutton Steaks 
Should be xut from a loin or neck that has hung ; if a 
neck the bones should not be long. They should be 
broiled on a clear fire, seasoned when half-done, and 
often turned ; take them up into a very hot dish, rub a 
bit of butter on each, and serv« hot and hot the monient 
they are done. 

Steaks of Mutton, or Lamb, and Cucumbers, 
Quarter cucumbers, and lay them into a deep dish, 
sprinkle them with salt, and pour vinegar over them. 
Fry the chops of a fine brown, and put them into a stew- 
pan ; drain the cucumbers, and put over the steaks ; add 
some sliced onions, pej^r, and salt ; pour hot water or 
weak broth on them ; stew and skim well. 

Mutton Steaks Maitttenon. 
Half-fry, strew them while hot with herbs, crunfvbs, and 
seasoning; put them in paper immediately, and finish

rub a bit of butter on it first to prevent that. 

Mutton Sausages. ' • ^ 
Take a pound of the rawest part of a leg of mutton 
that has been either roasted or boiled ; chop it extremely 
small, and season it with pepper, salt, mace, and iwit- 
raeg: add to it six ounces of beef-suet, some sweet herbs, 
two anchovies, and a pint of oysters, all chopped very 
small ; a quarter of a pound of grated bread, some of

CJear the gravy from the fat ; and put into it four oun- 
ces of boiled rice, an onion stuck with cloves, and a 
blade of mace ; boil theni till the rice is thick. Wash 
the rumps with yolks of eggs well beaten ; and slrr'v%' 
over them crumbs of bread, a little pepper and salt, 
chopped parsley and thyme, and grated lemon-peel, 
i^ry in butter of a fine brown. While the rumps are 
•stewing, lard the kidneys, and put them to roast in a 
Dutch oven. When the rumps are fried, the grease 
must be drained before they are put on the dish, and the 
pan being cleared likewise from the fat, warm the rice 
in it. Lay the latter on the di:>h ; the rumps put round 
on the rice, the narrow ends towards the middle, and tiie 
^kidneys between. Garnish with hard eggs cut in half, 
the white being left on; or with different coloured 
j>ickles.

POULTRY, GAME, &c. 

To choose Poultry, Game, SfC. 

A turkey-cock, — If young, it has a smooth black leg, 
with a short spur. The eyes full and bright, if fresh, and 
the feet supple and moist. If stale, the eyes will be sunk, 
and the feet dry. 

Hen-turkey is known by the sanrie rules ; but if old, 
her legs will be red and rough. 

Fowls, — If a cock is young,, his spurs will be short ; 
but take care to see they have not been cut or pared, which 
is a trick often practised. If fresh, the.vent will be close 
and dark. Pullets are best just before they begin to lay, 
aiul yet are full of egg : if old hens, their combs and legs 
will be rough ; if young,, they will be smooth. A good 
capon has a thick belly and a large rump : there is a par- 
ticular fat at his breast, and the comb is very pale. Black 
legged fowls are most moist, if for roasting. 

E 4 



80 DOMESTIC COOKSRT. 

Geese. — ^The bill and feet of a young one will be y^ 
low, and there will be but few hairs upon them ; \\ o\dt 
Ihey V'ill be red: if fresh, the feet will be pUabk'/v 
stale, dry and stiff. Geese are called green till three w 
four months old. Green geese should be scaldeti: & 
stubble-goose should be picked dry. 

Ducks. — Choose them by the same rules, of having 
Rupple feet, and by their being hard and thick on the 
breast and belly. The feet of a tame duck are thick, 
and inclining to dusky yellow ; a wild one has the feet 
reddish, and smaller than the tame. They should be 
picked dry. Ducklings must be scalded. 

Pigeons should be very fresh ; when they look flabby 
about the vent, and this part is discoloured, they are stale. 
The feet should be supple; if old, the feet are harsh. 
The tame ones are larger than the wild, and are thought 
best by some persons ; they should be fat and tender ; l>ut 
many are deceived in their size, because a full crop is as 
large as the whole body of a small pigeon. 

Ihe wood pigeon is large, and the flesh dark-coloured : 
if proptrly kept, and not over-roasted, the flavour is 
equal to teal. Serte with a good gravy. 

Plovers. — Choose those that feel haid at the vent, 
which shews they are fat. In other respcctr., choose tbeni 
by the same marks as other fowl. When stale, the feit 
are dry. They will keep sweet a long time. There are 
three sorts: the grey, green, and bastard plover, or lap- 
wing. 

Hare or rabbit — If the claws are blunt and rugged, the 
ears dry aXid tough, and the haunch thick, it is old ; but 
if the claws are smooth and sharp, the ears easily tear, and 
the cleft in the lip is not much spread, it is young. If 
fresh and newly killed, the body will be stiff, and in hares 
the flesh pale. But they keep a good while by proper 
care ; and are best when rather beginning to turn, if the 
inside is preserved from being musty. To know a real 
leveret, you should look for a knob or small bone near 
the foot on its fore leg ; if there is none, it is a hare. 

Partridges.'^They are in season in autumn. If young.

(he bill is of a dark colour^ and the ]egi yellowish ; if 
fresh, the vest will be firm ; but thb part will look green- 
ish if stale. 

Phauanis, — The cock-bird is accounted best^ cxtcpt 
when the hes is with egg:, if young, he has riiort blunt 
or round spurs; but if old^ they arc long and sharp. 

Directions for dressing Poultry and Game. 
All poultry should be very carefully picked, every plug 
removed^ and the hair nicely singed with white paper. 

The cook musl.be careful in drawing poultry of all 
sorts, not to break the gall-bag, for no washing will take 
off the bitter Where it has touched. 

In dressing 'wild fowl, be careful to keep a clear brisk 
fire. Jjtt them be done of a fine yellow brown, but 
leave the gravy in : the fine flavour is lost if done too 
much. 

Tainc fowls require more roasting, and are longer in 
heating through than others. All sorts should be conti* 
nually basted ; that they may be served with a froth, 
and appear of a fine colour. 

A large fowl will take three quarters of an hour ; a mid- 
dling one half an hour; and a very small one, or a chicken, 
twenty minutes. The fire must be very quick and clear 
before any fowls are put down. A capdn will take from 
half an hour to thirty-five minutes ; a goose an hour ; 
wild ducks a quarter of an hour ; pheasants twenty mi* 
nutes ; a small turkey stiiffed, an hour and a quarter; tur- 
key-poults, twenty minutes ; grouse, a quarter of an hour : 
quails, ten 'minutes; and partridges, from twenty to 
twenty-five minutes. A hare will'take near an hour; and' 
the hind part requires most heat. 
' Pigs and geese require a brisk fire, ai^ quick turning. 
Hares and rabbits must be well attended to: and the 
extremities brought to the quick, part of the fire,, to be 
done equally with the backs. .

with butter, a little cream, and a spoonful of soy» if ap- 
proved ; and pour it over the bird ; or liver and lemon- 
sauce. Hen birds are best for boilings and should be 
young. 

To roast Turkey. 

The sinews of the legs should be drawn, which ever way 
it is dressed. The head should be twisted under the wing ; 
and in drawing it, take care not to tear the liver, nor let 
the gall tuuch it. 

Put a stuffing of sausage-m^at ; or if sausages are to 
be served in the dish, a bread-stuffing. As this makes a 
large addition to the size of the bird, observe that the 
heat of the fire is constantly to that part ; for the breast is 
ofiten not done enough. A little strip of paper should be 
put on the bone« to hinder it from scorching while the 
other parts roast. Baste well, and froth it up. Serve with 
gravy ill the dish, and plenty of bread-sauce in a sauce- 
tureen. Add a few crumbs, and a beaten egg to the 
stuffing of sausage-meat. 

Pulled Turkey. 

Divide the meat of the breast by pulling instead of cut-' 
ting ; then warm it in a spoonful or two of white gravy, 
and a little cream, grated nutmeg, salt, and a little flour 
and butter ; don't boil it. The leg should be seasoned, 
scored, and broiled, and put into the dish with the above 
round it. Cold chicken does as well. 

To boil FoztU, 

For boiling, choose those that are not black -legged. 
Pick them nicel^, singe, wash, and truss them. Flour 
them, and put them into boiling water. — See time of 
dressing^page 81. 

Serve with parsley and butter ; oyster, lemon, liver, or 
celery sauce. 

If for dinner, ham, tongue, or bacon, is usually served 
to eat wilk them ; as likewise greens.

To boil fowl with Rice. 

Slew the fowl very slowly in some clear mutton-broth 
well sklmnied ; and seasoned with onion, mace, pepper, 
and salt. About half an hour before it is ready, put in a 
quarter of a pint of rice well washed and. soaked. Sim- 
mer till tender ; then strain it from the broth, and put the 
rice on a sieve before the fire. Keep the fowl hot, lay it 
in the middle of the dish, and the rice round it without 
the broth. The broth will be very nice to eat as such, 
but the less liquor the fowl is done with the better. 
Gravy^ or parsley and butter, for sauce. 

Fowls roasted*, 

Serve with egg-sauce, bread-sauce, or garnished with 
sausages and scalded parsley, 

A large barn-door fowl, well hung, should be stuflTed in 
the crop with sausage-meat ; and served with gravy in 
the dish, and with bread-sauce. 

The head should be turned under the wing, as a turkey^ 

Fowls broiled. 

Split them down the back; pepper,, salt, and broil. 
Serve with mushroom-sauce. 

Another way. — Cut a large fowl into four quarters, put 
them on a bird-spit, and tie that on another spit ; ai^cl 
half-roast ; or half roast the whole fowl, and finish either 
on the gridiron, which will make it less dry than if wholly 
broiled. . The fowl that is not cut before roasted, must 
be split down the back after. 

Davenport Fowls. 

Hang young fewU a night: take the livers, hearts, aml^ 
t^nderfjst parts of the gizzards, shred very small, with, 
half a handful of young clary, an anchovy to.each fowl, an. 
onion, and the yolks of four eggs boiled hard,, with pepper,, 
salt, and mace, to your ta^. Stuff the fowls with this^ 
and sew up the vents and. necks quite close, that the water 
may not get in. Boil theni in salt and water till almost 
done: then drain them, and put tjiera into a stew-pan 
with butter onough to brown tliein. Serve them with fine

melted butter, and a spoonful of ketchup, of either sort, 
iu the dish. 

A nice vmy to dress a Foxvlfor a small dish. 
Bone, singe, and wash, a young fowl : make a force- 
meat of four ounces of veal, two ounces of scraped lean 
of ham, two ounces of fat bacon, two hard yolks of eggs, 
a few sweet herbs chopped, two ounces of beef suet, a 
tea-spoonful of lemon-peel minced quite fine, an anchovy, 
salt, pepper, and a very little Cayenne. Beat all in a mor-* 
tar, wHh a tea-Cupful of crumbs, and the yolks and whi^ 
of three eggs. Stuff the inside of the fowl, and draw the 
legs and wings inwards ; tie the neck and rump close. 
Stew the fowl in a white gravy ; when it is done through 
and tender, add a hurge cupful of cream, and a bit oC 
butter and flour; give it one boil, and serve: the last 
thing, add the squeeze of a lemon. 

To force FowU ^e. 
Is to stuff any part with forcemeat, and it i» put usaaUy 
betwt»en the skin and flesh. 

To braise. 
Is to put meat into a stew-pan, covered with fat bacon : 
then add six or eight onions, a faggot of herbs, carrots if 
to be brown, celery, any bones, or trimmings of meat 
or fowls, and some stock (which you will find among 
^01^ and Gravies), The bacon must be covered with a 
paper, and the lid of the pan must be put down close. 
Set it oh a slow stove; and according to what it is, it will 
require two or three hours. The meat is then to be taken 
out ; and the gravy very nicely skimmed, and set on to 
bfHl very quidr till it is tlncfc. The meat is to be kept 
hot; and if larded, put into the oven for a few minutes: 
and then put the jelly over it, which is called glazing, and; 
is used for ham, tongue, and many made dishes. White 
wine is added to some glazing. The glaze should be of 
a beautiful clear yellow brown> and it is best to put it on 
with a nice brush.

in a little gravy made of the liquor they were boiled in, 
and a bit ot ireal or mutton, oaion, uiace, and lemon* 
peel, some white pepper, and a bunch of sweet herbs. 
When quite tender, keep them hot w hile you thicken the ^ 
sauce in the fojlowiog manner : Strain it off, and put it * 
back into the sauce-pan with a little salt, a scrape of nut- , 
meg, and a bit of flour and butter; give it one boil ; and 
wlien you are going to serve, beat up the yolk of an egg, 
add half a pint of cream, and stir them over the fire, but 
don'jt let it boil. 1 1 will be qu ite as good without the egg. 

The gravy may be made (without any other meat) of 
tiie necks^ feet, small wing-bones, gizzards, and livers ;. 
which are called the trimmings of the fowls. 

To puU Chickens. 

Take off the skin ; and pull the flf^h off the bone of a^ 
cold fowl, in as large pieces as you can : dredge it with 
flour, and fsy it of a nice brown in butter. Drain the but-* 
ter from it ; and then simmer the flesh in a good gravy • 
vell-seasoued, and thickened with a littie flour and butter* 
Add the juice of half a lemon. 

Anoiher way. — Cut off the legs, and the whole back, o£ 
^ dressed chicken ; if under-done the better. Pull all the 
white part into little flakes free from skin; toss it up with 
a little cream thickened with a piece of butter mixed with 
ftouT, half a. blade of mace in powder, white pepper, salt,. 
and a squeeze of lemon. Cut off the neck-end of the 
chicken ; and broil the back and sidesmen in one piece». 
and the two legs seasoned. Put the hash in the middle^ 
with the back on it ; and the two legs at the end. 

{^ikken Currie. 
Cojtup the chiekMis raw, slice onions, and fry both in' 
hutter with great care, of a fine light brown ; or if yoi» 
^ise chickens thathave been dressed^ fVy only the onions. 
Lay the joipts, cut into two or three pieces each, into a 
s^ew-pan; with a veal or mutton gravy, and a clove or 
two of garlick. Simmer till the chicken is quite tender. 
Half an hour before youierve it^ rub smooth a spoonM

or two of currie-powder, a spoonful of-floiu*, aud an ounce 
of butter; and add this, with four large spooufuls o^ 
cream, to the stew. Salt t© your taste; ff^ken serving, 
squeeze in a little lemon. 

Slices of under-done veal, or rabbit, turkey, &c. make 
excellent currie. 

A disK of rice boiled dry must be served. For direc- 
tions to io this, see the article Rice in the Index. 

Another y more cosily made, — Cut up a chicken or 
young rabbit; if chicken take oif the skin. Roll each 
piece in a mixture of a large spoonful of flour, and lialf an 
eunce of currie-powder. Slice two or three onions; and 
fry them in butter, of a light brown: then add the meat^^ 
and fry all together till the meat begins to br^own. Put it 
all into a stew-pan, and pour boiling water enough just to 
cover it. Simmer very gently- two or three hours. If too- 
thick, put more water half an hour before serving. 

If the meat baa been dnessed before,, a little broth wilt' 
be better than water: but the currie is richer when made- 
of fresli meat. 

To braise Chickens. 

Bone them, and fill them with forcemeat. Lay the- 
bones, and any other poultry trimmings, into a stew-pan, 
and the chickens on them.v Put to them a few onions, a 
faggot of herbs, three blades of mace, a pint of stock, and 
a glass or two of sherry. Cover the chickens with slices^ 
of bacon, and then white paper ; cover the whole close,, 
and put them on a slow stove for two hours. Then take 
them up, strain the braise, and skim off the fat carefully: 
set it on to boil very quick to a glaze, and do the chickens 
over with it with a brush. 

Serve with a brown fricassee of mushrooms. Before 
glazing, put the chicken Into an oven for aiew minutes,, 
to give a little colour. 

Ducks roasted. 

Serve with a fine gravy : and stuff one with sage and: 
onion, a desert-spoonful of crumbs, a bit of butter^ a04-

To boil Ducks, 
Choose a fine fat duck; salt it two days, then boil it 
slowly in a cloth. Serve it with onion-sauce, but melt 
\he butter with milk instead of water. 

To stew Ducks, 
Half-roast a duck ; put it into a stew-pan witli a pint of 
beef-gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut small, pep* 
per and s^t, and a small bit of onion shred as fine as possi- 
ble. Simmer a quarter of an hour, and skim clean ; then 
add near a quart of green peas. Cover close, and simmer 
near half an hour longer. Put in a piece of butter anda 
little Aoui, and give it one boil ; then serve in one dislu . 

To liash Ducks. 
Cut a cold duck into joints; and warm it, without 
boiling in gravy, and a glass of port wine. 

To roast diose. 
After it is picked, the plugs of the feathers pulled out,. 
a&d the hairs carefully singed, let it be well washed and 
dried, and a seasoning put in of onion, sage, and pepper 
and salt.' Fasten it tight at the neck and rump, and then 
roast. Put it first at a distance from the fire, and by de- 
grees draw it nearer. A slip of paper should be skewered 
on the breast-bone. Baste it very well. When the breast 
is rising, take off the paper; and be careful to serve it be- 
fore the breast falls, or it will be spoiled by coming flatted^ 
to table. Let a good gravy be sent in the dish. 

Gravy and apple-sauce : gooseberry-sauce for a green 
goose. 

To steiv Giblets. 
Do them as will be directed for giblet-pie (under the 
head Pics) ; season them with salt and pepper, and a 
-very small piece of mace. Before serving, give them 
oqe boil with a cup of cream, and a piece of butter rub- 
bed in a tea-spoonful of fiour. 

Pigeons 
May be dressed in so many ways, that they are very use- 
ful. The good fkivouF of them depends very much on 
their being cropped and ^^d<tewn as soon as killed. No 
other bird re^uues so much washing. 



88 DOMESTIC COOKE&T. 

Pigeons left fiom dinner the day before may be stewed, 
or made into a pie; in either case, care mu*tbe taken not 
to overdo them, which will make them stringy. They 
need only be heated iip in gravy made ready ; and force- 
meat balls may be fried and added, instead of patting a 
stufling info them. If for a pie, let beef^steaks be stewed 
in a little water, and put cold under them, and cover eacir 
pigeon with a piece of fat bacon, to keep them moist. 

Season as usual, and put eggs. 

To stew Pigeons. 

Take care that ^hey are quite fifesh, and carefully crop- 
ped, drawn, and washed ; then soak them half an hour, 
in the mean time cut a hard white cabbage in slices (as if 
for pickling) into waterr drain it, and then boil it m 
milk and waterr drain it again, and lay some of it 
at the bottom of a stew-pan. Put the pigeons upon it, biit 
first season them well with pepper and salt ; and- cov^ 
them with the remainder of the cabbage. Add a littlr 
broth, and stew gently till the pigeons are tender ; then 
put among them two or- three spoonfuls of cream, and a- 
piece of butter and floor, for thickening. After a boil or 
two, serve the birdvin the middle> and "Sie cabbage placed' 
round them. 

Another way. — Stew the birds in a good brown gravy, 
either stuffed or not ; and seasoned high, with sjMce and 
mushrooms fresh, or a little ketchup. 

To broil Pigeons. 
* After cleaning, split the backs, pepper and salt them, 
and broil them very nicely 7 pour over them either stewed 
of pickled mushrooms in melted buttery and serve as hot 
as possible. 

EoQstPigeons 
Should be stuffed with parsley, either cut or whole ; and^ 
seasoned within. Serve with parsley and butter. Pear 
or asparagus should be dressed to eat with them. 

To Piekk Pigeons. 

Bone them; turn the inside out, and' lard it Seasonr 
with a little allspice and salt, in fine powder; then turn 
tbem again, and tie the neck and rump with thread. Put 



POULTRY. S9 

(hem into boiling water: let them boil a minute or (wo to 
plump: take th^m out, ao^ dry them well ; then put them 
boiling hot into the pickle, which must be made of equal 
<iuantitie8 of white wine and white wine vinegar^ with 
white pepper and allspicei sliced ginger aiul nutmeg, and 
two or three bay-leaves. ,Wh€ii it boils up, put the pi- 
geoo$ iu« . If fbey ue small, a quarter of an hour will do 
them.;. but ih^y will take twenty minutes if barge. Then 
take them out, wipe themi and let them cool. When the 
pickle is cold, take the fat off from it, and put them in 
again. Keep them in a^io/if jar, lied down with a blad- 
der to keep out the air. 

Instead of larding, put into some a stuffing made of 
hard yolks of eggs and marrow in equal quantities, with 
sweet herbs, pepper, salt, and mace. 

Pigeons in Jelly, 

Save soine^ of the liquor in which a knuckle of veal has 

been boiled: or boil a calf's or neat's foot ; put the broth 

into a pan with a blade of mace, a bunch of sweet herbs, 

some white pepper, lemon-peel, a slice of lean bacon, 

and the pigeons. Bake them, and let them stand to be 

cold. Seasoa them as you like, before baking. When 

done, take them out of the liquor, cover them close to 

preserve the colour, and clear the jelly by boUiag it with 

the whites of tw o eggs ; then straiu it through a thick 

cloth dipped iu boiling water, and put into a sieve. The 

fat must be perfectly removed, before it be cleared. Put 

the jelly over and round them rough. 

The same, a beautiful dish. — Pick two very nice 
pigeons ; and make tiiem look as well as possible by 
singeing, washing, and cleaning the heads well. Leave 
the heads and the feet on, but the nails must be clipped 
close to the claws. Roast them of a very nice brown ; 
s^nd when done, put a little sprig of myrtle into the bill of 
each. Have ready a savoury jelly, as before, and with it 
half-iill a bowl of such a size as shall be proper to turn 
down on the dish you mean it to be served in. When 
the jelly and the birds are cold, see that no gravy hang to 
the birds, and then lay thiem upside, down in the jelly. 



90 DOMESTU3 COOKERY. 

Before* the rest of it begin to set, pour it over the birds, 
so as to be three inches above the feet. This should be 
done full twenty-four hours before serving. 

This dish has a very handsome appearance in the mid- 
dle range of a second course; or w lien served with the 
jelly roughed large, it makes a side or corner thing, its 
size being then less. The head should be kept up a5 if 
alive, by tying the neck with some thread, and the legs 
bent as if the pigeon sat upon them. 

To pot Pigeons. 
Let them be quite fresh, clean them carefully, and 
season them with salt and pepper: lay them clohe in a 
small deep pan; for the smaller the surface, and the 
closer they are packed, the less butter will be wanted. 
Cover them with butter, then with very thick paper tied 
down, and bake them. When cold, put them dry into 
pots that will hold two or three in each ; and pour butter 
over them, using that which was baked as part. Observe 
that the butter should be pretty thick over them, if they 
are to be kept. If pigeons were boned, and then put in 
an oval form into the pot, they would lie closer, and re- 
quire less butter. "^They may be stuffed with a fine force* 
meat made with veal, bacon, &c. and then they will eat 
excellently. If a high flavour is approved of, add mace, 
allspicej and a little Cayenne, before baking. 

Larks, and oifier small Birds, 
Draw, and spit them on a bird-spit; tie this on an* 
other spit, and roasit them. Baste gently with butter, and 
strew bread-crumbs upon them till half-done: brown and 
serve with fried crumbs round. 

GAME, ^c. 

To keep Game, Sfc, 
Game ought not to be thrown away es^i when it has 
been kept a very long time ; for when it seems to be 
spoiled it may often be made fit for eating, by nicely 
cleaning it, and washing with vinegar and water. If there 
is danger of birds not keeping, draw, ccop, and pick 
them ; then wash in two or Uiree waters, and ruU then);

r vifhsalt. Have ready a large sauce-pan of boilmg water, 

aaJ plunge them into it one by one ; dra>%'ing them up 

aoddowp by the legs, that the water may pass through 

^m, Let them stay five or six minutes in ; then hang 

them up in a cold place. When drained, pepper and 

salt the insides well. Before roasting, wash them well. 

The most delicate birds, even grouse, may be pre- 
served thus. Those that live bv suction cannot be done 
Ibis way, as they are never drawn ; and perhaps the heat 
might make them worse, as the water could not pass 
through them ; but they bear being high. 

Lumps of charcoal put about birds and meat will pre- 
serve them from taint, and restore what is spoiling. 

Pheasants and Partridges. 
Roast them as turkey; and serve with a fine gravy 
(into which put a very small bit of garlick), and bread- 
sauce. When cold, they may be made into excellent 
patties, but tlieir flavour should not be overpowered by 
lemon. For the manner of trussing a pheasant or par- 
tridge^ see plate IX. 

To pot Partridge, 
Clean them nicely ; and season with mace, allspice, 
white pepper, and salt, in fine powder. Rub every part 
well ; then lay the bteasts downwards in a pan, and pack 
the birds as close as you possibly can. Put a good deal 
of butter on them; then cover the pan with a coarse 
fiour-paste and a paper over, tie it close, and bake. 
When cold, put the birds into pots, and cover them with 
butten 

j1 very cheap xaay of potting Birds, 

Prepare them as directed in the last receipt ; and when 
baked and grown cold, cut them into proper pieces for 
helping, pack them close into a large potting-pot, and (if 
possible) leave no spaces to receive the butter. Cover 
them with butter, and one-third part less wiH be wanted 
than when the birds are done whole. 

The butter that has covered potted things will serve fop 
basting, or for paste for meat-pics. 



92 DOMESTIC COOKEKT. 

To clarify Butter for potud Tliiigf. 
Put it into a sauce-boat, and set that over the 6re in a 
stew-pan that has a little water in. When ntdtcd, take 
care not to pour the milky parts over the potted things : 
they will sink to the bottom. 

To pot Moor Oamt. 

Pick, singe, and wash the binis nicely : then dry them ; < 
and season, inside and out, pretty high^ with j^epper, 
mace, nutmeg, allspice, and salt. Pack them in as small 
a pot as will hold them, cover them with butter, and b^ke 
in a v^ery slow oven. When cold, take off the butter, 
dry them from the gravy, and put one bird into each 
pot, which should just fit. Add as much more butter as 
will cover them, but take care that it does not oil. The 
best way to mek it ii, by wanning it in a basin set ?ta a 
bowl of hot water. 

Gtouk, 

Boast them like fowls, but the head is to be twisted 
under the wing. They must not be over-done. Serve 
with a rich gravy in the dish, and bread-sauee. The 
sauce for wild-fowl, as will be described hereafter mider 
the head of Saiu:e$^ may be used instead of coromon 
gravy. 

To roast fFild fowl. 

The flavour is best preserved without stuffing* Pat 
pepper, salt, and a piece of butter, into each. 

Wild fowl require much less dressing than tame : they 
should be served of a iine colour, and well frothed up, 
A rich brown gravy should be sent in the dish ; and when 
the breast is cut into slices, before taking oiT the l>onej 
a sq.u^2e of feinon, with pepper and salt, is a great im- 
provement to the flavour. 

To take off the flshy taste which wild fowl sometimes 
hav^y put an onion, salt, and hot water, into the dripping- 
pan, and baste them for the first ten minutes with this; 
then take away the pan, and baste constantly with butter. 

f^ild Ducks, Teal, ffidgeon. Dun-birds, Sfc. 
Should be takeu up with the gravy in. Baste them with 



GAME, &C. 03 

butter, and spriukle a little salt before they are taken up ; 
put a good gravy under them, and serve with shalot- 
sauce in a boat. 

IToodcockSf Stupes, and Quails, 

* Keep good several days^ Roast them without drawing, 
asd serve on toast. Butter only should be eaten with 
them, as gravy takes off from the fine flavour. The 
tbigh and back are esteemed the most.' For the manner 
of trussing a woodcock or snipe, see plate IX. 

Ruffs and Reeves 

Are skewered as qiiails; put bars of bacon over them, 
and roast them about ten minutes. Serve with a good 
gravy, in the dish. 

To dress Plovers, 

Boost the green ones in the same way as woodcocks 
and quails (see above), without drawing ; and serve on 
a toast. Gre^ plovers may be either roasted, or stewed 
with graVy, herbs, and spice. 

Plovers* Eggs 
Are a nice and fashionable dish. Boil them ten minutes, 
and serve eitlier hot or cold on a napkin. 

To roast Ortolans, 
Pick and singe, but do not draw them. Tie on a bird- 
spit, and roast them. Some persons like bacon in slices 
tied between them, but the taste of it spoils the flavour 
of the ortolan. Cover then! with crumbs of bread. 

Guinea and Pea Fowl 
Eat much like pheasants. Dress them in the same way 
(seepage 91). 

Hares, 

If properly taken care of, will keep a great time: and 
even when ttue cook fancies them past eating, may be in 
the highest perfection ; which if eaten when fresh-killed 
they are not. . As they are usually paunched in the fleld, 
the cook cannot prevent this; but the hare keeps longer, 
and eats much better, if not opened for four or five days, 
or according to the weather. 



94 DOMESTIC COOKERT« 

• If paunched, as soon as a hare comes in, it should be 
wiped quite dry, the heart and liver taken out, and ike 
liver scalded to keep for the stuffing. Repeat this wiping 
every day ; mix pepper and ginger, and rub on the in- 
side ; and put a large piece of charcoal .into it Iftfec 
spice is applied early, it will prevent that musty taste 
ivhich long keeping in the damp occasions, and which 
also affects the stuffing;. 

An old hare should be kept as long as possible; if to 
be roasted. It must also be well soaked. 

To roast Hare, 

After it is skinned, let it be extremely well washed, 
and then soaked an hour or two in water ; and if old, lard 
it; which will make it tender, as also will letting itlie 
in vinegar. 

If however it is put into vinegar, it should be exceed- 
ingly well washed in water afterwards. Put a large 
relishing stufiing into the belly, and then sew it up. Baste 
it well with milk till half-done, and afterwards with butter. 
If the blood has settled in the neck, soaking the part iq 
warm water, and putting it to the fire warm, will remove 
it ; especially if you also nick the skin here and there 
with a small knife to let it out The hare should be kept 
at a distance from the fir^^ at first Serve with a fine 
froth, rich gravy, melted butter, and currant-jelly sauce; 
the gravy in the dish. For stuffing use the liver, an an- 
chovy, some fat bacon, a little suet, herbs, pepper, salt, 
nutmeg, a little onion, crumbs of bread, and an egg to 
bind it all. 

The ears must be nicely cleaned and singed. They 
are reckoned a dainty. 

For the manner of trussing a hare, see plate IX. 

To jug an old Hare. 

After cleaning and skinning, cut it up ; and season it 
Avith pepper, salt, allspice, pounded mace, and a little 
nutmeg. Put it into a jar with an onion, a cloveor two, 
a bunch of sw«et herbs, a piece of coarse beef, and the

carcase-bones over all. Tie the jar down with a bladder, 
and leather or strong paper; and put it into a sauce-paii 
of water up to the neck, but no higher. Keep the water 
boiling five hours. When it is to be served, boil the 
gravy up .with a piece of butter and flour ; and if the 
meat ^ets cold, warm it in this, but not to boil. 

Broiled and hashed Hare. 

The flavour of broiled hare is particularly fine; the 
legs or wings must be seasoned first ; rub with cold but- 
ter, and serve very hot. 

The other parts, warmed with gravy, and a little stuff- 
ing, may be served separately. 

To pot Hare, 
For which an old one does well, as likewise for soup and 
pie. 

After seasoning it, bake it with butter. When cold, 
ake the meat from the bones, and beat it in a mortar. 
If not high enough, add salt, mace, pepper, and a piece

he gravy that came from the hare. When well mixed,

Rabbits 
May be eaten various ways, as follows : 

Roasted with stuffing and gravy, like hare, or without 
stuffing; with sauce of the hver and parsley chopped in 
melted butter, pepper, and salt ; or lardtd. For the 
manner of trussing a rabbit for either roasting or boiling, 
iee plate IX. 

Boiled, and smothered with onion-sauce ; the butter 
to be melted with milk instead of water. 

Fried in joints, with dried or frfed parsley. The same 
liver-sauce, this way also. 

Fricasseed, as before directed (in page 84) for chickens. 

In a pie, as chicken, with forcemeat, &c. In this way 
they are excellent when young. 

Potted.

To make a Rabbit taste much like Hare, \ '^ 

Clioofte o»e that is young, but ful 1 -grown: hang it iu 
the skin tliree or four days; then skin it; and lay it, 
without washing, ui a seasoning of black pepper arid all- 
spice in a very fine powder, a glass of port wine, and the 
same quantity of vinegar. Baste it occasionally, for forty 
hours ; then stufT it ; and roast it as a liare, and with the 
same sauce. Do not wash off the liquor that it viS 
soaked in. 

To pot Rabbits, 
Cut up two or three young but full-grown ones, and 
take the leg-bones off at the thigh ; pack them as closely 
as possible in a small pan, after seasoning them with 
pepper, mace, Cayenne, salt, and allspice, all in very 
line powder. Make the top as smooth as yoii can. Keep 
out the heads and the. carcases, but take off the meat 
about the neck. Put a good deal of butter, and bake the 
whole gently. Keep it two days in the pan ; then shift it 
into small pots, adding l)utter. The livers also should be 
added, as they eat well. 

To blanch Rabbid Fowl, SiC. 
Is to set it on the fire in a small quantity of cold water, 
and let it boil: as soon as it boils, it is to be taken out, 
and put into cold water for a few minutes.

SOUPS AND GRAVIES. 

General Directions respecting Soups and Gravies, 

When there is any fear of gravy-meat being spoilt be- 
fore it be wanted, season well, and fry it lightly, which 
will preserve it two days longer ; but the gravy is best 
when the juices are fresh. 

When soups or. gravies are to be put by, let them be 
changed every day into fresh scalded pans. W hatever has 
vegetables boiled in it, is apt to turn sour sooner than the 
juices of meat. Never keep any gravy, &c. ia metal. 



SOUPS. 97 

When £3t remains on any soup, a tea-cupful of flour and 
water mixed quite smooth, and boil«d-in, will take it olf. 

If richness, or ^leater consistency be wanted, a good 
lump of butter mixed with flour, and boded in the soup 
will give either of these qualities. 

■ Long boiling is.necessary to give the full flavour of 
fine ingredients, therefore time should be allowed for soups 
and gravies; and they are best if made the day before 
they are wanted. 

Soups and gravies are far better when the meat is put 
at the bottom of the pan, and stewed, and the h. rbs. roots, 
&c. with butter, than when water is put to the meat at 
first; and the gravy that is drawn from the meat should 
be almost dried up before the water is put to it. Don't 
use the sediment of gravies, &c. that have stood to be 
cold. When onions are strong, boil a turnip witli them, 
if.for sauce ; this will make them mild. 
. If soups or gravies are too weak, do not cover them in 
boiling, that the watery particles may evaporate. 

A clear jelly of Cow-heels is very useful to keep in the 
house, being a great improvement to soups and gravies. 

Truffles and morels thicken soups and sauces, and give 
them a fine flavour. Wash half an ounce of each care- 
fully, then simpler them a few minutes in water, and add 
them with the liquor, to boil in the sauce, &c. till tender. 

soups, &c. 

Scotch Mutton Broth. 

Soak a jneck of mutton in water for an hour ; cut off the 
scrag, and put it into a stew-pot with two quarts of water. 
As soon as it boils, skim it well, and then simmer it an 
hour and a half; then take the best end of the mutton, cut 
it into pieces (two bones in each), take some of the fat off, 
and put as many as you think proper: skim the moment 
th^ fresh meat boils up, and every quarter of an hour 
afterwards. Have ready four or five carrots, the same 
aumber of turnips and three onions, all cut, but not small ; 
and put them in soon enough to get quite tender: add 
four large spoonfuls of Scotch barley, first wetted with

cold water. The meat should stew three hours. Salt to 
taste, and serve all together. 1 weiity minutes before 
•erving, put iu some chopped parbiey. It Is an ezoelltrnt 
•wtntcr-dish. 

Fcal Broth. 
Stew a small knuckle in about three quarts of water, 
two ounces of rice, a little salt, and a blade of mace^ till 
the liquor is half wasted away. 

Colouring fin" Soups or Gravies^ 
Put four ounces of lump sugar, a gill of water, and half 
an ounce of the finest butter, into a small tosser, and set it 
over a gentle fire. Stir it with a wooden sjmkmi, till of a 
bright brown. Then add half a pint of water ; boil,* skim, 
and when cold, bottle and cork it close. Add to soup or 
gravy as much of this as will give a proper colour. 

A clear brown Stock for Gravif'Soup or Gravy. 
Put a knuckle of veal, a pound of lean beef, arid a 
pound of the lean of a gammon of bacon, all sliced, into 
a stew-pan with two or three scraped carrots, two onions, 
two turnips, two heads of celery sliced, and two quarts 
of water. Stew the meat quite tender, but do not let it 
brown. When thus prepared, it will serve either for 
soup, or brown or white gravy ; if for brpwn gravy, put 
some of the above colouring, and boil a few minutes. 

An excellent Soup. 
Take a scrag or knuckle of veal, slices of undressed 
gammon of bacon, onions, maCe, and a small quantity of 
water; simmer till very strong; and lower it with a good 
beef-broth made the day before, and stewed till the meat 
is done to rags. Add cream, vermicelli, and almonds, as 
will be directed in tlie next receipt, and a roll. 

jin excellent white Soup. 
Take a scrag of mutton, a knuckle of veal after cutting 
off as much meat as will make collops; two or three shank* 
bones of mutton nicely cleaned, and a quarter of a pound 
of very fine undrestlean gammon of bacon; with a bunch 
of sweet berl>s, a piece of fresh lemon-peel, two or three 
onions, three blades of mace, and a desert- spoonful of

for half an hour afterwards. 

A plainer xihite Soup, 
Two or three pints of soup may be made of a small 
knuckle of veal, with seasoning as directed in the last ar« 
tide ; and both served together, with the addition of a 
quarter of a pint of gootl milk. Two spoonfuls of cream, 
and a little ground rice, will give it a proper thickness.

^int of -^nt peas, or a quart of whole ones, twelve car- 
rots, six tiirni)>s, six potatoes, six large onions, a bunch 
of sweet herbs, and two heads of celery. Simmer them

ioto a very cold place. When cold, take off the cake of 
fat (wliicb will make crusty for servants' pies,) put the 
•oup into a doubled-bottomed tin sauce-pan, and set It oa 
a pretty quick fire, but don't let it burn. It must boil 
fast and uncovered, and be stirred constantly, for eight 
hours. Put it into a pan, and let it stand in a cold place 
a day ; then pour it into a round soup chlna-disb» and 
aet the dish into a stew-pan of boiling water on a stove, 
and let it boil, and be now and then stirred, till the soup

they are to be used, melt them in bmling water; and if 
you wish the flavoiur of herbs, or any tiling else, boil it 
£rst, strain off the water, and melt the soup ui it. 
This is very convenient in the country, or at sea, where 
. fresh meat is not always at hand; as by this means a 
basin of soup may be made in five minutes. 

Soup meigre. 
Melt half a pound of butter into a stew-pan, shake it 
round, and throw in six middling onions sliced. Shake 
the pan well for two or three minutes; then put to it fire

some crusts of bread, a tea^spoonfol of beaten pepper, 
three or four blades of mace; and if you have any while 
beet leaves, add a large handful of them cut small. 
Boil gently' an hour. Just before serving, beat-in two 
- yolks of eggs and a large spoonful of vinegar.

mace, pepper, salt, an onion stuck with cloves, a head of 
celery, two parsley-roots sliced, and a bunch of sweet 
lierbs. Simmer an hour and a half closely covered, and 
then strain it off for use. If for brown soup, first fry the 
fish brown in l>utter, and then do as above. It will not 
keep more than two or three days. 

Eel Soup, 

TaJ^e three pounds of small eels : put to them two 
quarts of water, a crust of bread, three blades of mace, 
some whole pepper, an onion, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs: cover them close, and stew till the Ash is quite 
broken ; then strain it off. Toast some bread, cut it into 
dice, and pour the soiip on it boiling. A piece of car- 
rot may be put in at first. This soup will be as rich as if 
made of meat. A quarter of a pint of rich cream, with 
a tea-6po<»)ful of flour rubbed smooth in it, is a great imr 
provement 

Skate Smtp.

the crumb of a French roll, some white pepper, salt, twa 
anchovies, a large onion, sweet herbs, and a bit of lemon- 
peel, till you have extracted the goodness of them all. 
Strain it otf. Beat the spawn in a mortar, with a bit of 
butter, a quarter of a nutmeg, and a tea-spoonful of fiour ; 
mix it with a quart of cream. Cut the tails into pieces,, 
and give them a boil up with the cream and soup.

a thomback, well cleaned,) with as much water as will 
cover them ; skim them clean, and put in whole pepper, 
mace, ginger, parsley, an onion, a little thyme, and 
three cloves. Boil to a mash. Pick fifty crawfish, or t 
hundred prawns; pound the shells, and a little roll; but 
iirst boil them with a little water, vinegar, salt, and herbs: 
put this liquor over the shells in a sieve; then pouttbt 
other soup, clear from the sediment. Chop a lobster^ 
and add this to it, with a quart of good beef-grary : add 
also the tails of the crawfish or the prawns, and some fie«r 
and butter; and season as may be liked, if not high 
enough. 

Oi/sier Soup, 

Take two quarts of fish-stock, as directed m pagt 106 » 
beat the yolks of ten hard eggs, and the hard part of 
two quarts of oysters, in a mortar, and add this to ttie 
Stock. Simmer it all for half an hour ; then strain it off, 
and put it and the oysters (cleared of the beards, and 
nicely washed) into the soup. Simmer five minutes: 
have ready the yolks of six raw eggs well beaten, anA 
add them to the soup. Stir it all well one way on the 
iide of the fire till it is thick and smooth, but tlon't let it 
toil. Serve all together. 

Oyster Mouth Soup. 

Make a rich mutton broth, with two large onions, 
three blades of mace, and black pepper. When strained 
pour it on a hundred and fifty oysters, without the 
beards, and a bit of butter rolled in flour. Simmer

fieneral Directions respecting Gravies. 
Giravy may be made quite as good of the skirts 6C 



GRAvres. 109 

t>ccf, and the Indney, as of any other meat, prepared in 
the same way. 

An ox kidney, or milt, makes good gravy, cut all to 
pieces, and prepared as other meat; and so will the 
shank-end of mutton that has been dressed, if much be 
Dot wanted. 

The shank-bones of mutton are a great improvement to 
tbe richness of gravy; but first soak them well, and 
Scour them clean. 

Taragon gives the flavour of French cookery, and in 
liigti gravies is a great improvement; but it should be 
«idded only a short time before serving. 

To draw Gravy that wiil keep a Week. 

Cut lean iieef thin, put it into a frying-pan without 
^ny butter, and set it on a fire covered, but take care it 
^oes not bum : let it stay till all the gravy that comes 
^out of the meat is dried up into it again ; put as much 
'^vateic 28 will cover the meat, and let that, stew away. 
*Then put to the meat a small quantity of water, herbs, 
•onions, spice, and a bit of lean ham ; simmer till it is 

3-ich, and keep' it in a cool place. Don't take oif the fat 

^ill going to be used. 

Clear Gravy, 
Slice beef thin ; broil a part of it over a very clear 
quick fire, just enough to give colour to the gravy, but 
not to dress it : put that and the raw into a very nicely 
tinned stew-pan, with two onions, a clove or two, whole 
^ black peppers, berries of allspice, and a bunch of sweet 
herbs: cover it with hot water, give it one boil, and skim 
it well two or three times ; then cover it, andsliiHner till 
quite strong. 

CuUis, or brown Gravy. 

Lay over the bottom of a stew-pan as much lean veal 
as will cover it an inch thick ; then cover the veal with 
thin slices of undressed gammon,- two or three onions, 
two or three bay-leaves, some sweet herbs, two blades 
of mace, and three cloves. Cover the stew-pan, and 
set it over a slow fire ; but when the juices cotae QWt> Vtt

it, then simmer an hour: add a little water, minced with 
«s much as fiour as will make it properly thick: boil it half 
an hour, and strain it This will keep a week. 

Bechamel, or xvhite Sauce, 

Cut lean veal Into small slices, and the same quantity 
of lean bacon or ham : put them into a stew-pan with a 
good piece of butter, an onion, a blade of mace, a few 
mushroom-buttons, a bit of thyme, and a bay-leaf ; fry 
the whole over a very slow fire, but not to brown it ; 
thicken it with flour; then put an equal quantity of good 
broth, and rich cream ; let it boil half an hour, and stir 
it all the time ; strain it through a soup-sLrainer. 

A Gravy without Meat, 

Put a glass of small beer, a glass of water, some pep- 
per, salt, lemon-peel grated, a bruised clove or two, and 
a spoonful df walnut-pickle, or mushroom-ketchup, into 
a basin. Slice an onion, flour and fry it in a piece of 
butter till it is brown. Then turn all the above into a 
small tosser with the onion, and simmer it covered 
twenty minutes. Strain it off for use, and when cold 
take off the fat. 

ji rich Gravy. 

Cut beef into thin slices, according to the quantity

a light pale-brown, but dcm't on any account suffer them 
to get black: put them into a stew-pan, pour boiling 
water on the browning in the firying-pan, boU it up, and 
pour on the meat. Put to it a bunch of parsley, thyme, 
and savoury, a small bit of knotted marjoram, the same 
.of taragon, some mace, berries of allspice, whole black 
peppers, a clov« or two, and a bit of ham, or gammon 
of bacon. Simmer till you have extracted all the juices 
of the meat; and be sure to skim the moment it boils, 
and often after. If £or a hare, or stewed, fish, anchovy 
should be added..

it. 

Set them over the fire, and stir all the time; and when 
the butter has boiled once or twice, take them off, and 
keep the sauce-pan near the lire, but not on it ; for if 
done too much, the oysters will be hard. Squeeze a little 
lemon-juice, aiid serve. 

If for company, a little cream is a great improvement 
Observe, the oysters will thin the sauce, so put butter 
accordingly. 

Lobster Sauce, 
Pound the spawn, and two anchovies; pour on them 
two spoonfuls of gravy ; strain all into some butter melt^

lemon. 

Anollier way, — Leave out the anchovies and gravy ; 
and do it as above, either wfth or without a little salt and 
ketchup, as you fike. Many prefer the Havour of the 
lobster and salt only. 

Shrimp Sauce.

ounces of the best butter, oo a trencher. Put it into a 
small sauce-pan» and two or three table-spoonfuls of hot

looks whiter. 

Vingaret, for cold Fowl, or Meat, 
Chop mint) parsley, and shalot, mix with salt, oil, snd

Shalot Vinegar, 
Split six or eight shalots ; put them into* a quart bottle, 
and fill it up with vinegar, stop it, and in a month it will 
be fit for use. 

GuRp Vinegar, 
Slice a large head of gariick ; and put it into a wide- 
mouthed bottle, with half au ounce of Cayenne, two tea- 
spoonfuk of real soy, two of walnut-ketchup, four an>> 
chovies chopped, a pint of vinegar, and enough cochineal 
to give it the colour of lavender-drops. Let it stand six 
weeks ; then strain off quite clear, and keep in small 
bottles sealed up. 

Sugar Vinegar, 
To every gallon of water put two pounds of the very 
coarsest sugar, boil and skim thoroughly, then put one 
quart of cold water for every gallon of hot. When cool, 
put into it a toast spread with yeast. Stir it nine days; 
then barrel, and set it in a place where the sun will lie on 
it, witli a bit of slate on the bung-bole. Make in March, 
it will be ready in six months. 

When sufficiently sour it may be bottled, or may be 
used from the cask with a wooden spigot and faucet. 

Gooseberry Vinegar, 
Boil spring' water: and when cold, put to every three 
^uafti^ a quart of bruised goosebeiTies in a large lob. 



SAUCES. 121 

Let them remain sixty hours^ srtirrmg often ; then strain 
through a hair bag, and to each gallon of liquor add a 
pound of the coarsest sugar. Put it into a barrel, and a 
toast and yeast ; cover the bung-hole with a bit 6f slate, 
&c. as above. The greater quantity of sugar and fruit, 
the stronger the vinegar. • 

Cucumber Vinegar, 

' Pare and slice fifteen large cucumbers, and put them 
in a stone jar, with three pints of vinegar, four large 
onions sliced, two or three shalots, a little garlick, two 
large spoonfuls of salt, three tea-spoonfuls of pepper, 
and half a tel-spoonfnl of Cayenne. After standing four 
^ays> give the whole a()oil; when cold, strain, and 61tre 
the liquor through paper. Keep in small bottles, to add 
to salad, or eat with meat. 

Wine Vinegar, 

After making raisin wine, when the fruit has been 
strained, lay it on a heap to heat, then to every hundred 
weight put fifteen gallons of water — set the cask, and put 
yeast, &c. as before. 

As vinegar is so necessary an article in a family, and 
one on which so great a profit is made, a barrel or two 
might always be kept preparing, according to what 
suited. If the raisins of wine were ready, that kind 
might be made ; if a great plenty of gooseberries made 
them cheap, that sort ; or if neither, then the sugar vine- 
gar — so that the cask may not be left empty, and grow 
musty, 

NastitrtionSffor Capers. 

Keep them a few days after they are gathered ; then 
pour boiling vinegar over them, and when cold, cover. 

They will not be fit to eat for some months ; but are 
then finely flavoured, and by many preferred to capers. 

To fnake Mustard,

boiling water, to a proper thickness, rubbing it perfectly 
smooth ; add a little salt, and keep it in a small jar close

coveredf and put oni j as much into the glass as will be 
used soon ; which should be wiped daily round the edges. 

Another way, for immediate use. 
Mix the mustard with new milk by degrees, to be quite 

smooth, and add a little raw cream. It is much softer 

this way, is not bitter, and will keep well. 
The patent mustard is by many preferred, and it is 

perhaps as cheap, being always ready ; and if the pots are 

returned, three-pence b allowed for each. 
A tea-spoonful of sugar, to half a pmt of mustard, is 2k 

great improvement^ and softens it. 

Kitclien Pepper, 

Mix in the finest powder, one ounce of ginger; of 
cinnamon, black pepper, nutmeg, and Jamaica pepper, 
half an ounce each: ten cloves, and six ounces of salt* 
Keep it in a bottle — it is an agreeable addition to any 
brown sauces or «oups. 

Spice in powder, kept in small bottles close stopped^ 
goes much further than when used whole. It must b^ 
dried before pounded ; and should be done in quantities 
that may be wanted in three or four months. Nutmeg^ 
need not be done — but tlie others should be kept in sepa- 
rate bottles, with a little label on each. 

To dry Mushrooms, 

"Wipe them clean ; and of the large take out the brown, 
and peel of the skm. Lay them on paper to dry in a 
cool oven, and keep them in paper bags, in a dry place. 
When used, simmer them in the gravy, and they will 
swell to near their former size ; to simmer them in their 
own liquor till it dry up into them, shaking the pan, then 
drying on tin plates, is a good way, with spice or not, as 
above, beifore made into powder. 

Tie down with bladder; and keep in a dry place, or 
in paper. 

Mushroom Powder. 

Wash half a peck of large mushrooms while quite fresh, 
and free them from grit and dirt with flannel ; scrape out * 
the black part clean> and do not use any that are woijo-

nten; put them into a stew:-pan over the fire without 

t^er, with two large onions, some cloves, a quarter of 

^n ounce of mace, and two spoonfuls of white pepper, all 

Jo powder; simmer and shake them till all the liquor be 

dried up, but be careful they don't burn. Lay them oa 

^ns or sieves in a slow oven till they are dry enough to 

beat to powder, then put the powder in small bottlcst 

corked, and tied closely, and keep in a dry place. 

A t«i-spoonful will give a very ^ne flavour to any soup 
Or gravy, or any sauce ; and it is to be added just befot e 
serving, and one boil given to it after it is put in. 

To choose Anchovies, 
They are preserved in barrels, with bay salt ; no other 
fish has the fine flavour of the anchovy. The best look 
xed and mellow, and the bones moist and oily : the flesh 
should be high flavoured, the liquor reddish, and have a 
iine smell. 

Essence of Anchovies. 
Take two dozen of aiichoyies, chop them, and without 
the bone, but with some of their own liquor strained, add 
them to sixteen large spoonfuls of water ; boil gently till 
dissolved, which will be in a few mijiutes — ^when cold, 
strain and bottle it. 

To keep Anchovies v^lien the liquor dries. 
Pour on them beef-brine. 

To make Sprats taste like Anchovies. 
Salt them well, and let the suit drain from tliem. In 
twenty-four hours wipe them dry, but don't wash them. 
Mix four ounces of common salt, an ounce of bay salt, 
an ounce of saltpetre, a quarter of an ounce of sal prunel, 
and half a tea-spoouful of cochineal ; all iq the finest pow- 
der. Sprinkle it among three quarts of the fish, and pack 
them in two stone jars. Keep in a cold place, fastened 
down with a bladder. 

These are pleasant on bread and butter; but use the 
best for sauce.

Observations on Savoury Pies, 
THEUE are few articles of cookery more generally 
liked than relishing pies, if properly made; and they

may be made so of a gr^at variety of things. Some are 
best eaten when cold, and, in that case, there should be 
no suet .put into the forcemeat that is used with them. 
If the pie is either made of meat that will take more dress- 
ing, to make it extremely tender, than the baking of the 
crust will allow ; or, if it is to be served in an earthen pie- 
form ; observe the following preparation : 

Take three pounds of the veiny piece of beef (for in- 
stance) that has fat and lean ; wash it ; and season it with 
salt, pepper, mace, and allspice, in fine powder, rub- 
bing them well in. Set it by the side of a ?low fire, in a 
ftew-pot that will just hold it; put to it a piece of butter, 
of about the weight of two ounces, and cover it quite 
close ; let it just simmer in its own steam till it begins to 
shrink. When it it cold, add more seasoning, force- 
meat, and eggs : and if it is in a dish, put some gravy 
to it before baking ; but if it is only in crust, don't put 
the gravy till after it is cold and in jelly, as has been de- 
scribed in pages 111 and 112. Forcemeat may be put 
both under and over the meat, if preferred to balls. 

Eel Pie. 

Cut the eels in lengths of two or three inches, season 
with pepper and salt, and place in the dish, with some 
bits of butterj and a little water; and cover it with 
paste. * . 

Cod Pie. 

Take a piece of the middle of a small cod, and salt it 
well one night: next day wash it: season with pepper, 
salt, and a very little nutmeg, mixed ; place in a dish, 
and put some butler on it, and a little good broth of any 
kind into the dish. 

Cover it with a crust ; and when done, add a sauce of 
a spoonful of broth, a quarter of a pint of cream, a little 
flour and butter, a grate of lemon and nutmeg, and give 
it one boil. Oysters may be added. 

Mackerel will do well, but do not salt them till used. 

Parsley picked and put in, may be used instead of 
oysters.

Sole Pic. 
SpHt some soles from the booe» and cut the fios close; 
season « ith a mixture of salt» pepper, a little nutmeg and

will do, and half a hundred of oysters. Put in the dish 
the oyster-liquor, two or three spoonfuls of broth, and 
tuiue butter. When the pie comes home, pour in a cup- 
ful of thick cceam. 

Shrimp Pie, excelknU

or three anchovies ; mix these with the spice, and then 
season the shrimps. Put some butter at the bottom of 
tlie dish, and over the shrimps, with a glass of sharp 
white wine. The paste must be* light and thin. They 
do not take long baking. 

LohHcr Pie. 
Boil two lobsters, or three small, take out the tails, cut 
them in two, take out- the gut, cut each in four pieceS} 
ui'.d lay in a small dish, pot in then the meat of the clawsi

furry parts from the latter, and take out the lady ; the 
Kpawn, beat in a mortar ; likewise all the shells: set them 
on to slew with some water, two or three spoonfuls of 
vinegar, pepper, salt, and some pounded mace ; a large 
piece of butter, rolled in flour, must be added when the 
goodness of the shells is obtained : give a boil or two, 
and pour into the dish strained ; strew some crumbs, and 
put a paste over all ; bake slowly, but only till \hc paste 
be done. 

A remarkably fne Fish Pie,

and lay it at the bottom of the dish. Take the flesh of 
toleSf small cod, or dressed turbot, and lay them on the 
fiMjcemeaty having rubbed it with salt and pepper : pour 
the gravy over and bake. 

Observe to take off the skin and fins, if cod or soles. 

Pilchard and Leek Pie, 
Clean and skin the white part of some large leeks ; 
scald in milk and water, and put them in layers into ^ 
dish, and between the layers, two or three salted pil- 
chards which have been soaked for some hours the day 
before. Cover the whole with a good pla'm crust. When 
the pie is taken out of the oven, Tift up the side crust with 
a knife, and empty out all the liquor; then pour iu half 
a pint of scalded cream. 

Berf-sUak Pie. 
Prepare the steaks as in page 57, and when seasoned 
and rolled with fat in each, put them in a dish with puff 
paste round the edges ; put a little water in the dish, and 
cover it with a good crust. 

real Pie. 
Take some of the middle, or scrag, of a small neck ; 
season it ; and either put to it, or not, a few slices of lean 
bacon or ham. If it is wanted of a high relish, add mace,. 
Cayenne, and nutmeg, to the salt and pepper ; and aUo 
forcemeat and eggs ; and if you choose, add tru files, mo- 
rels, mushrooms, sweetbreads cut into small bits, and 
cocks'-cbmbs blanched, if liked. Have a rich gravy 
leady, to pour in after baking. — It will be very good, 
vkhout any of the latter additions. 

A rick Feal Pie. 
Cut steaks from a neck or breast of veal ; season them; 
with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and a very little clove in pow- 
der. Slice two sweetbreads, and season them in the same 
manner. Lay a puff paste on the ledge of the dish ; then; 
put the meat, yolks of hard eggs, the sweetbreads, and' 
some oysters up to the top of the dish. Lay over the 
whole some very thin slices of ham, and fill up the dish- 
with water ; cover; and when it b taken out of lh« oycHv 



f39 DOMSftTIC COOKCKT. 

pour in at the top, throiigh a funnel, a few spoonfuls of 
good veal-gravy, and some cream to fill up ; but first 
boil it up with a tea-spoonful of flour. Truffles, &c. if 
approved. 

Feed (or Chicken) and Parsley Pie. 

Cut some slices from the leg or neck of veal ; if the leg, 
from about the knuckle. Season them vrith salt ; scald 
some parsley that is picked from the stems, and squeeze 
it dry ; cut it a little, and lay it at the bottom of the dish ; 
then put the meat, and so on, in layers. Fill the dish 
with new milk, but not so high as to touch the crust* 
Cover it ;.and when baked, pour out a little of the milk, 
and put in l>alf a pint of good scalded cream. 

Chicken may be cut up skinned, and made in the same 
way. 

Feat- Olive Pie, 

Make the olives as directed in page 51 ; put them 
round and round the dish, making the middle highest, 
Fill it up almost with water, and cover it Add gravy, 
cream, and fiour. 

Calfs-head Pie. 

Stew a knuckle of veal till fit for eatmg, with two 
onions, a few isinglass shavings, a bunch of herbs, a blade 
of mace, and a few pepper-corns, in three pints of water. 
Keep the broth for the pie. Take off a bit of the meat 
for the balls, and let the other be eaten, but simmer the 
bones in the broth till it is very good. Half-boil the head, 
and cut it in square bits ; put a layer of ham at the bot- 
tom; then some head, first fat then lean, with balls and 
hard eggs cut in half, and so on till the dish be full : but be 
particularly careful not to place the pieces close, or the 
pie will be too solid, and there will be no space for the 
jelly. The meat must be first pretty well seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Put a 
little water and a little gravy into the dish, and cover it 
with a tolerably thick crust; bake it in a slow oven, and, 
when done, pour into it as much gravy as it can possibly 
hold, and do not cut it till perfectly cold ; in doing which 
observe to use a very sharp knife, and first cut out a large

bit, going down to the bottom of the dish; and when 
done tbus> thinner slices can be cut! the different co- 
ioursy and the clear jelly, have a beautiful marbled ap- 
pearance. 

A small pie may be made to eat hot, M'hich with high 
Seasoning, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, morels. Sec. has 
a very good appearance. 

The cold pie will keep many days. Slices make a 
pretty side-dish. 

Instead of isinglass, use a calfs-foot, or a cow-heel, if 
the jelly is not likely to be stiff enough. 

The pickled tongues of former calves'-heads may be 
Gut Id, to vary the colour, instead of, or besides ham. 

Excelkni Pork Pies, to eat cold. 

Raise common boiled crust into either a round or oval 
form, as you choose ; have ready the trimming and small 
bits of pork cut off when a hog is killed ; and if these are 
not enough, take the meat off a sweet bone. Beat it well 
With a rolling-pin ; season with* pepper and salt, and keep 
the fat and lean separate. Put it in laye'rs, quite close 
Up to the top; lay on the lid; cut the edge smooth 
round, and pinch it ; bake in a slow soaking oven, as the 
meat is very solid. Directions for raising the crust will 
be given hereafter. The pork may be put into a com- 
mon dish, with a very plain crust; and be quite as good. 
Observe to put no bone or water into pork-pie ; the out- 
^de of the pieces will be hard, unless the^ are cut small 
and pressed close. 

Mutton Pie, 

Cut steaks from a loin or neck of mutton that has hung; 
beat them, and remove - some of the fat Season with 
salt, pepper, and a little onion ; put a little water at the 
bottom of the dish, and a little paste on the edge ; then 
cover with a moderately thick paste. Or raise small 
pies, and breaking each bone in two to shorten it, season, 
and cover it over, pinching the edge. When they come 
out, pour into tach a spoonful of gravy made of a bit of 
mutton.

^y-i DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Squab Pie. 
Cut supples as (or other pies, and lay them in rovrs 
with mutton-chops ; shred onion, and sprinkle it among 
them, and also some sugar. 

Lamb Pie. 

Make it of the loin, neck, or breast ; the breast of 
house-Iamb is one of the most delicate things that can be 
eaten. It should be very lightly seasoned with pepper 
and salt ; the bone taken out, but not the gristles ; and a 
small quantity of jelly gravy be put in hot; but the pie 
should not be cut till cold. Put two spoonfuls of water 
before baking. 

Grass lamb makes an excellent pie, ahd may either be 
boned or not, but not to bone it is perl^ps the best. 
Season with only pepper and salt; put two spoonfuls of 
water before baking, and as much gravy when it comes 
from the oven. 

iVo^e.—- Meat-pies being fat, it is best to let out tbe 
gravy on one side, and put it in again by a funnel, at the 
centre, and a kttle may be added. 

CluckenPie,

Cut Up two young fowls; season with white pepper, 
salt, a little mace, and nutmeg, all in the finest powder; 
likewise a little Cayenne. Put the chicken, slices of hamr 
or fresh gammon of bacon, forcemeat-balls, and hard- 
eggs* by turns, in layers. If it is to be baked in a dish,, 
put a little water ; but none if in a raised crust. By the 
time it returns from the oven, have ready a gravy of 
knuckle of veal, or a bit of the scrag with some shank- 
bones of mutton, seasoned with herbs, onion, mace, and 
white pepper. If it is to be eaten hot, you may add 
truffles, morels, mushrooms, &c. hut not if t » be eaten 
cold. If it is made in a dish, put as much gravy as will 
.fill it; but, in raised crusty the gravy must be nicely 
strained, and tlien put in cold as jelly. To make the 
;elly doar, you may give it a boil with tlKe whites of twQ 
eggs, after taking away the meat, and then rua it tiirough 
a tine Uwn sieve. 



SAVOURY PIES* 13J. 

Rabbits, if young and in flesh, do as well : thetr leg^ 
should be cut short, and the breast-bones must Bot go in, 
but will help to make the gravy. 

Green-goose Pie. 
Bone two young green geese, of a good size ; but first 
take away every plug, and singe them nicely. Wash 
Ihem dean; and season them high with salt, pepper, 
mace, and allspice. Put one inside the other; and press 
them as close as you can, drawing the legs inwards. Put 
a good deal of butter over them, and bake them either 
with or without crust; if the latter, a cover to the dish 
must fit close to keep in the steam. It will keep long. 

Duck Pie, • 

Bone a full-grown young diick and a fowl; wash tbera, 
and season with pepper and salt, and a small proportion 
of mace and allspice in the finest powder. Put the fowl 
within the duck, and in the former a calPs-tongue pickled 
red, boiled very tender and peeled. Press the whole 
close; the skins of the legs should be drawn inwards, 
that the body of the fowls may be quite smooth. If ap- 
proved, the space between the sides of the crust may be 
filled with a fine forcemeat, made according to the second 
receipt given for making forcemeat in page \25, Bake 
it in a slow oven, either in a raised crusty or pie-dish with 
a (hick crust, ornamented. t 

The large pies in Staffordshire are made as above : but 
with a goose outwards, then a turkey, a duck next, then 
a fowl ; and either tongue, small birds, or forcemeat, in 
the middle. 

Giblet Pie, 

After very nicely cleaning goose or duck giblets, stew 
them with a small quantity of water, onion, black pepper, 
and a bunch of sweet herbs, till nearly done. Let them 
grow cold ; and if not enough to fill the dish, lay a beef, 
veal, or two or three mutton steaks, at bottom. Put the 
liquor'of the stew to bake with the above ; and when the 
pie is baked, pour into it a large tea-cupful of cream. 

Sliced potatoes added to it, eat extremely well. 



134 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Pigeon Pic, 

Rub the pigeons with pepper and salt, inside and ool; 
in the latter put a bit of butter, and, if approfdi,«iK 
parsley chopped with the livers, and a little of the same 
seasoning. Lay a beef-steak at the bottom of the ^ 
and the birds on it ; between every two, a hard eggi 
Put a cup of water in the dish ; and if you have any ban 
in the house, lay a bit on each pigeon : it is a great iflk- 
provement to the flavour. 

Observe, when ham is cut for gravy or pies, to take the 
under part rather than the prime. 

Season the gizzards, and two joints of the wings, and 
put them in the centre of the pie ; and over them, in a 
hole made in the crust, three feet nicely cleaned, to shew 
what pie it is. 

Partridge Pic in a dish. 
Pick and singe four partrid^ ; cut off the legs at the 
knee ; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, thyme, 
and mushrooms. Lay a veal-steak, and a slice of ham, 
at the bottom of the dish ; put the partridge in, and half 
a pint of good broth. Put puff paste on the ledge of the 
ilish, and cover with the same; brush it over with egg, 
aful bake an hour. 

Hare Pie, to eat cold, • 
Season the hare after it is cut up ; and bake it, with 
eggs and forcemeat, in a raised crust or dish. When it 
is to be served, cut off the lid, and cover it with jell)'- 
gravy, asin jwgif 111. 

^ French Pie. 
Lay a puff-paste round on the ledge of the dish : aiid 
put in either veal in sFices, rabbits or chickens jointed ; 
with forcemeat-balls, sweetbreads cut in pieces, aiti- 
cboke-bottojns, and a few truffles. 

Vegetable Pie. 

Scald and blanch some broad beans ; cut young carrots, 

turnips, artichoke-bottoms, mushrooms, peas, onions, 

lettuce, parsley, celery, or any of them you have ; make 

the whole into a nice stew, witibuvcmie good veal-gravy.

SAVOURY PIES. 135 

^ake a crust over a dish, with a little liuing round the 
^^, and a cup turned up to keep it from sinking. When 
kikedy open the lid, and pour in the stew. 

Parsley Pie, 

Liy a fowl, or a few bones of the scrag of veal, sea* 
billed, into a dish ; scald a colander-full of picked pars* 
ky in milk ; season it ; and add it to the fowl or meat, 
%ith a tea-cupful of any sort of good broth, or weak 
grayy. When it is baked, pour into it a quarter of a pint 
<rf cream scalded, with the size of a walnut of butter, and 
a bit of flour. Shake it round, to mix with the grav j 
already in. 

Lettuces, white mustard leaves, or spinach may be 
added to the parsley, and scalded before put in. 

Turnip Pie, 

Season mutton-chops with salt And pepper, reserving 
the ends of the neck-bones to lay over the turnips, which 
must be cut into small dice, and put on the ste^s. 

Put two or three good spoonfuls of milk in. You may 
add sliced onioh. Cov^r with a crust. 

Potatoe Pie. 
Skin some potatoes, and cut them into slices: season 
them ; and also some mutton, beef, pork, or veal. Put 
layers of them and of the meat. 

An Herb Pie. 
Pick two handfuls of parsley .from the stems, half the 
quantity of spinach, two lettuces, some mustard and 
cresses, a few leaves of borage, and white beet-leaves ; 
wash, and boil them a little ; then drain, and press out 
the water : cut them small ; mix, and lay them in a dish^ 
iprinkled with some salt. Mix a baiter of flour, two eggs 
nrell beaten, a pint of cream, and half a pint of milk, 
iind pour it on the herbs ; cover with a good crust, and 
i>ake. 

Raised Crust for Meat-pies, or Fowls, Spc. 
Boil water with a little fine lard, and an equal quantity

making the paste as stiff as you can to be smooth, vlndi 
you \f\\\ make it by good kneading and beating it vitb 
the roiling'pin. When quite smooth, put in a luiqp iolil 
a cloth, or under a pan, to soak till near cold. 

Those who have not a good hand at raising crust vuf 
do thus: Roll the paste of a proper thickness, and cutoOt 
the top and bottom of the pie, then a long piece for tiff 
tides. Cement the bottom to the sides vrith egg, briog* 
ing the former rather further out, and pinching both to* 
gether : put egg between the edges of the paste, to make 
it adhere at the sides. Fill your pie, and put on the co- 
ver, and pinch it and the side crust together. The same 
mode of uniting tlie paste is to be observed if the sides 
are pressed into a tin form, in which the fiaste must be 
baked, after it shall be filled and covered ; but in tbe 
latter case, the tin should be buttered, and carefully taken 
off when done enough*; and as the form usually makes 
the sides of a lighter colour than is proper, the paste I 
should be put into the oven again for a r^uarter of aa 
hour. With a feather, put egg over at first. 

PUDDINGS, &c. 

Observations <m making Puddings and Pancakes, 

The outside of a- boiled pudding often tastes disagree- 
ably ; which arises from the cloth not being nicely wash- 
ed, and kept in a dry place; It should be dipped in 
boiling water, squeezed dry, and floured when to be used. 

ii bread, it should be tied loose: if batter, tiglit over. 

The water should boil quick when the pudding is put 
in^ and it should be moved about for a minute^ lest the 
ingredients should not mix. 

Batter-pudding should be strained through a coarse 
sieve, when all is mixed. In others the eggs separately. 

The pans and basins must be always buttere<l. • 

A pan of cold water should be ready, and the pudding^ 
dipt in as soon as it comes out of the pot, and then it wiU 
not adhere to the cloth. 

Very good puddings may be made tuitkout eggs ; but 
they must have as IHtle milk as will mix, and must boiL

three or four hours. A*few spooiifulff of fresh small beer, 
or one of yeast, will answer instead of eggs. 

Or Snow is an excellent substitute for eggs, either in 
puddings or pancakes. Two large spoonfuls will supply 
the place of one egg, and the article it is used in will be 
equally good. Tliis is an useful piece of information, 
especially as snow often falls at the season when eggs are 
dearest. Fresh small beer, or bottled malt liquors, like- 
wise serve instead of eggs. The snow may be taken up 
from any clean spot before it is wanted, and will not lose 
its virtue, though the sooner it is used the better. 

Note, — The yolks and whites beaten long and scpa- 
nkly, make the article they are put into much lighter. 

Almond Puddings. 

Beat half a pound of sweet and a ^w bitter almonds 
^ith a spoonful of water; then mix four ounces of butter, 
four eggs, two spoonfuls of cream, warm with the butter^ 
one of brandy, a little nutmeg, and sugar to taste. 
Gutter some cups, half hll, and bake the puddiugd. 

Serve witli butter, wine^ and sugar. 

Baked Almond Pudding, 

Beat fine four ounces of almonds, four or five bitter 
ditto, with a little wine, yolks of six eggs, peel of two le- 
mons grated, six ounces of butter, near a quart of cream, 
and juice of our lemon. AVhen well mixed, bake it half 
an hour, with paste round the dish. 

Small Almond Pnddings. 

Pound eight ounces of almonds, and a few bitter, with 
a spoonful of water ; mix with four ounces of butter warm- 
ed, four yolks and two whites of eggs, sugar to taste, two 
spoonfuls o{ cream, and one of brandy ; mix well, and 
bake in little cups buttered. Serve with pudding-sauce. 

Sago Pudding, 

Boil a pint and a half of new milk, with four spoonfuls 
f)( sago nicely washed and picked, lemon-peel, cin- 
namon, and nutmeg; sweeten to taste; then mix four 
^ggs, put a paste round the dish, and bake slowly. 



138 DOMESTIC COOKERY. . 

Bread and Butter Pudding. 

Slice bread spread with butter, and lay it in a dish with 
currants between each layer ; and sliced citron, orange, 
or lemon, if to be very nice. Ponr over an unboiled 
custard of milk, two or three eggs, a few pimentos, and a 
very little rataiia, two hours at least before it is to be 
baked ; and lade it over to soak the bread. 

A paste roundthe edge makes all puddings look better, 
but is not necessary. 

Orange Pudding, 

Grate the rind of a Seville orange; put to it six ounces 
of fresh butter, six or eight ounces of lump sugar pouml- 
ed: beat them all in a marble mortar, and adrl as you do 
it the whole of eight eggs well beftten and strained ; scrape 
a raw ap]^e, and mix with the rest ; put a paste at the 
bottom and sides of the dish, and over the orange mixture 
put cross bars of paste. - Half an hour will bake it. 

Another, — Mix of orange paste two full spoons, with 
six eggSj four of sugar, four ounces of butter warm, and 
put into a shallow dish with a paste lining. Bake twenty 
minutes. 

Anotfter, — ^Rather more than two table-spoonfuls of the 
orange paste, mixed with six eggs, four ounces of sugaTf 
and four ounces of butter, melted, will make a good- 
sized 'pudding, with' a paste at the bottom of the disL 
Bake twenty minutes. 

An excellait Lemon Pudding. 
Beat the yolks of four eggs ; add four ounces of white 
sugar, the rind of a lemoo being rubbed with some lumpv 
of it to take the essence ; then peel, and beat it in a 
mortar with the juice of a large lemon, and mix all with 
four or five ounces of butter warmed. Put a crKst into t 
shallow dish, nick the edges, and put the above into it. 
When served, turn the pudding out of tlie dish. 

A very fine Anther Pudding, 
Put a pound of butter into a sauce-pan, with three 
quarters of a pound of loaf sugar finely powdered ; melt 
the butter, and mix well with it; then add -the yolks of

ifflcen eggs well beaten, and as much fresh candied- 
grange as will add colour and flavour to it, being first 
hesten to a fine paste. Line the dish with paste for turn- 
ing out ; and when filled with the above, lay a crust over, 
as you would a pie, and bake in a slow oven. 
It is as good cold a^ hot 

Baked Apple Pudding, 

Pare and quarter four large apples ; boil them tender, 
with the rind of a lemon, in so little water that, when 
done, none may remain; beat them (juite fine in a mor- 
tar; add the crumb of a small roll, four ounces of butter 
melted, the yolks of five and whites of three eggs, juice 
of half a lemon, and sugar to taste ; beat all together, 
and lay it in a dish with paste to turn out. 

Oatmeai Pudding. 

Pour a qiiart of boiling milk over a pint of the best 
/jitf oatmeal: let it soak all night; next day beat two 
eggs, and mix a little salt; butter a basin that will just 
hold it; cover it tight with a floured cloth, and boil it 
an hour and a lialt Eat it with cold butter and salt 

When cold, slice and toast it, and eat it as oatuake 
buttered. 

Dutch Pudding, or Souster, 

Melt one pound of butter in half a pint of milk; mix 
it into two pounds of flour, eight eggs, four spoonfuls of 
yeast; add one pound of currants and a quarter of a 
pound of sugar beaten and sifled. 

This is a very good pudding hot ; and equally so as 
a cake when qold. If for the latter, caraways may be 
used instead of currants. An hour will bake it in a quick 
oven. 

yl Dutch Mice Pudding. 

Soak four ounces of rice in warm water half an hour ; 
drain the latter from it, and throw it into a stew-pan, with 
half a pint of milk, half a stick of cinnamon, and sim-

twice,, and touch it no more than can be avoided. The

accustomed to make paste it may be better to do so.

To a quarter of a peck of fine flour use two pounds and:

water, and work it smooth and to. a good consistence.: 
Put a paste round the inside, but not to the bottom of, 
the dish, and let the. cover be pretty thick, to bear the 
long continuance in the oven. 

Riee Paste for Sweets,. 

Boil a quarter of a pound of ground ^ce in thesmfiHest. 
quantity of water :• strain from it all the moisture as well 
as you can; beat It in a mortar with half an ounce of 
butter, and ^ne egg well beaten, andi^ will ms^ an ex-

Rice Paste for relishing things. 

Clean, and put some rice, with an onion and a little 
"^'ater and milk, or milk only, into a sauce-pan, and sim- 
ixier till it swell. Put seasoned chops into a dish, and 
eoTcr it with the rice ; by the addition of an egg, the 
rice will adhere better. 
. Babbits fricasseed, and covered thus are very good. ■> 

Potatoe Paste. 

pound boiled potatoes very fine, and add, while warm, 
a sufficiency of butter to make the mash hold together, or 
you may mix with it an egg; then before it gets cold^ 
tiour tile board pretty well to prevent it firom sticking, 
and roll it to the thickness wanted. 
' If it is become quite cold before it be put on the dish, 
it will be apt to crack. 

Raised Crust for Custards or Fruit 

Put four ounces of butter into a sauce-pan with wat^, 
and wl^en it boils, pour it into as much flour as you 
choose ; knead and beat it till smooth ; cover it, as at the 
top of page 136. Raise it; and if for custard, put a 
paper within to keep out the sides till half done, then fill 
with a cold mixture of milk, egg, sugar, and a little peach- 
water, lemon-peel, or nutmeg. By cold is meant that 
the egg is not to be warmed, but the milk should be 
warmed by itself:— not to spoil the crust. 

The above butter will make a great deal of raised crust, 
which must not be rich, or it will be difficult to prevent 
the sides from falling. 

Excellent short Crusts^ 

Make two ounces of white sugar,, ponnded: and sifted,, 
quite dry ; then mix it with a pound of flour well dried ; 
rub into it three ounces of butter, so. flne as not to be 
seen— 'into some cream put the yolks of twoeggs, beaten,. * 
and mix the above into a smooth paste ; roll it tbin, and 
bake it in a moderate oven.

Another, not nccit, hut rick. — Rub six ounces of bat-' 
ter in eight ounces of fine flour ; mix it into a stiffish 
paste, with as little water as possible ; beat it well, and 
roll it thin. This, as well as the former, is proper for 
tarts of fresh or preserved fitiits. Bake in a moderate 
oven. 

A very fine Crust for Orange'cheesecakes, or Sareetmcats, 
xuhen to be particularly nice. 

Dry a pound of the finest flour, mix with it three 
ounces of refined sugar ; then work half a pound of butter 
with your hand till it come to froth; put the flour into it 
by degnees, and work into it, well beaten and strained, 
the yolks of three, and whites of two eggs. If too liml>er, 
put some flour and sugar to makfe it fit to roll. Line your 
pattypans, ind fill. A little above fifleen minutes will 
bake tkem. Against tbey come out, have ready some 
refined sugar beat up with the white of ao egg, as thick 
2f you can ; ice thl^m all over, set them in the oven to 
harden, and serve cold. Use fresh butter. 

Salt butter will make a very fine flaky cmst ; but if 
for miace-pies, or any sw^et things, shouid be wasfaetL 

ObtervatioM ok PaMry. 

An adept in pastry nearer leaves any part of it adhering 
to the board, or dish, used in making. It is best when 
soiled on- marUe, or a very large slate. In very hot 
weather, the butter should be piit into cold water to 
make it as firm as possible ; and if made early in the 
morning, and preserved from the air until it is to be 
baked, the cook will find it much better. A good b?nd 
at pastry will use much less butter^ and produce lighter 
crust than others. Salt' butter, if very good, and well 
washed, makes a fine flaky crust. 

Remark on using preserved Fruit in Pastry, 

Preserved fruits should not be baked long ; those that 
have been done with their full proportion of sugary re- 
quire no baking; the crust should be baked in a tin shape, 
and the fruit be afterwards added ; or it may be put into

VEGETABLEa 



Obseroatiotts on dressing P^egetabfek. • 



\''a 



VEGETABLES should be carefully cleaned fr^^- 
, sects, aiKl nicely washed. Boil them in plenty of vat^r, 
and drain them the moment they are done enough. If 
overboiled, they lose their beauty and crispness. Ba^ 
cooks sometimes dress them with meat ; which is wrongf . 
except carrots with boiling beef. 

To boil Vegetables green. 
'Be sure the water boils when you put them in. Make 
ihem boil very fast., Don^t cover, but watch tliem; and

if the waiter hat not slackened, you maj be sure they are 
done when they begin to sink. Then take them out iin* 
mediately, or the colour will change. Hard water, 
especially if chalybeate, spoils the colour of such vege- 
tables as should be green. 

To boil them greett in hard water, put a tea-spoonful 
if salt of wormwood into the water when It boils, before 
file vegetables are put in. 

To keep green Peas. 

"Siell, and put them into a kettle of water when it boils ; 

"0!fe tfaem two or three walms only, and pour them into a 

edander. When the water drains off, turn them out on 

- 9 dfcner covered with cloth, and pour them on another

es ; leaving only room to pour clarified mutton-sue^ 

them an inch thick, and for the cork. Rosin it

Another xvay, ae practised in the emperor of Russians 
kitchen, — SheU, scald, and dry them as above: put 
them on tins or earthen dishes in a cool oven once or 
twice to harden. Keep them in paper bags hung up in 
the kitchen. When they are to be used, let them lie an 
hour in water ; tiien set them on with cold water and a 
bit of butter, and boil them till ready. Put a sprig of 
dried mint to boil with them. 

Boiled Peas 
£liould not be overdone, nor in much water. Chop 
loiiie scalded mint to garnish them, and stir a piece of 
' butter in with them. 

To stew green Peas. 
' Put a quart of peas, a lettuce and an onion both sliced, 
a. bit of butter, pepper, salt, and no more water than 
hangs round the lettuce from washing. Stew them two 
hours very gently. When to be served, beat up an egg, 
and stir it into them : or a bit of flour and butter.

will be less of the flavour of the pea*. Chop a blt^ 
-nuntj and stew in them. 

To stew old Peai. 

Steep them in water all night, if not fine boilers; 
otherwise only half an hour: put them mto water enough 
just to cover them, with a guod bit of butter, or a piece 
of beef or pork. Stew them very gently till the peas are 
ioft, and the meat is tender; if it is iwt satt meat, add salt 
and a little pepper. Serve them round the meat. 

To dress JrHcltokes. 

Trim a few of the outside leaves off, and cut the stalk 
even. If young, half an hour will boil them. They are 
better for being gathered two or three days first. Serve 
them with melted butter in as many small cups as there 
jire artichokes, to help with each. 

Articlioke Bottoms. 

If dried, they must be soaked, then stewed in. weak 
gravy, and served with or without forcemeat in each. 
Or they may be boiled jn milk, and served with. cream- 
sauce; or added to ragouts, French pies, &c. 

Jerusakvi Artichokes

slowly; and before serving, if no butter was in before, 
put some, and a Uttle flour; or If tliere was butter in, 
-only a little flour, unless it wants richness. 

Another %^ay, — Slice the onions, and cut the cucum-

To drcM Brocoli. 
Cut the heads with short stalks, and pare the tough 
skin off them. Tie the small shoots into bunches, ao<l 
boil them a shorter time than the heads. Some salt must 
be put into the water. Serve with or without toast 

Spinach 
Requires great care in washing and picking it When 
that is done, throw it into a sauce-pan that will just.hold 
k,. sprinkle it with a little' salt, and cover close. The 
pan must be set on the fire, and well shaken. Wheo 
done, beat the spinach well with a small bit of butter: it 
must, come to table pretty dry ; and looks well if pressed 
into a tin mould in the form of a large leaf, which is sold, 
aft the tin shops. A spoonM of cream is an improve- 
atent. 

To drest Betms, 
B«) tender, with a bunch of parsley, which must be

^o not use them for this dish. 

French Beans. 

String, and cut them into four or eight; the last looks 
best. L&y them in salt and water ; and when the sauce- 
pan hwh, . put them in with some salt. As soon as they 
Itfe done, serve them immediately, to preserve the gr^ 
colour. • 

Or when half-done, drain the water off, and put theM 
into two spoonfuls, of broth strained ; and add a little 
cream, butter, and flour, to finish doing them. 

To stett^ red Cabbage.

i^>oonfuls of Tinegar^ and give one boil over the fire. 
Serve it for cold meat, or with sausages on it 

Another way. — Shred the cabbage ; wash it : and put 
It over a slow ^re, with slices of onion, pepper, and salt, 
and a little plain gravy. When quite tender, and a few 
ininutes before serving, add a bit of butter rubbed with 
fiour, and two or three spoonfuls of vinegar, and boil up. 

Another, — ^Cut the cabbage very thin ; and put it into 
the stew-pan with a small slice of ham, and halt an ounce 
of butter, at the bottom, half a pint of broth, and a gill 
of vinegar. Let it stew covered three hours. When it 
b very tender, add a little more broth, salt, pepper, and 
a table-spoonful of pounded sugar. Mix these well, and 
boil them all till the liquor is wasted; then put it int^ 
ttie dish, and lay fried sausages on it. 

Mushrooms. 
' The cook should be perfectly acquainted with the dif- 
fcrent sorts of things called by this name by ignorant peo- 
ple, as the death of many persons, has been occasioned 
by carelessly using the poisonous kinds. 

The eatable mushrooms first appear very small, and 
of a round furm, on a little stalk. They grow very fast, 
ind the upper part and stalk are white. As the size in- 
creases, the under part gradually opens, and shews a 
fringy fur of a very fine salmon-colour; which continues 
more or less till the mushroom has gained some size, and 
(hen turns to a dark brown. These marks should be at- 
tended to, and likewise whether the skin can be easily 
parted from the edges and middle. Those that have % 
white or yellow fur should be carefully avoided, though 
many of them have the same smell (but not so strong) as 
the right sort. 

To stew Mushrooms, 

The large buttons are best, and the small flaps while 
the fur is still red. Rub the large buttons with salt and 
a bit of flannel ; cut out the fur, and take o(T the skin, 
from the others. Sprinkle them with salt, and put into a 
ttew-pan with some pepper-corns: simmer slowly till 
dooe; then put a small bit of butter aud fiout» ^axv4 V«^

To stew Sojrrelfar Fncanflcau and roast Meat, 
AVash the f^orrcl ; and put it into a silver vessel, or 
stone jar, with no more water than hangs to the leaves. 
Simmer it as slow as you can ; and when done enou£^ 
put a bit of butter, and beat it well. 

French Salad. 
Chop three anchovies, a shalot, and some parsley* 
vniall; put them into a bowl with two table-spoonfuls of 
vine^^ar, one of oil, a little mustard, and salt. Wbea 
w^ll mixed, add by degrees some cold roast or boiled 
meat in vn^ thin slices; put in a few at a time, not ex« 
reeding two ur three inches long. Shake them in the 
stasoiiing, and then put more: cover the bowl close, 
and let the sal?.d be prepared three hours before it is to- 
be eaten* Garnish with parsley, and a few slices of the 

fat. 

Lobster Salad, 
Make a salad ; and put some of the red part of the 
lobster to it, cut. Tliis forms a pretty contrast to the 
white and green of the vegetables. Don't put much oil, 
as shell- fish absorb the sharpness of vinegar. Serve in ft 
dish, not a bowl. 

To boil Potatoes, 
. Set them on a fire, without paring them, in cold wa- 
ter; let them half-boll; then throw some salt in, and a 
pint of cold water, and let them boil again till almost 
done. Pour off the water; and put a clean cloth over 
tliem, and then th^ saucepan-cover, and set them by the 
fire to steam till ready. Many persons prefer steamers^ 
Potatoes look best when the skin is peeled, not cut. 

Do new potatoes the same; but be careful they are 
taken oiF in time, or they will be watery. Before dress- 
ing, rub off the skin with a cloth and salt, and then wa^.

r To mask Potatoes. 

Boil the potatoes, peel them, and break them to paste;* 
thcni to two pouads of them, add a quarter of a pint of 
milk, a little salt, and two ounces of butter, and stir it 
all well over the fire. Either serve them in this manner; 
or place them on the dish in a form, and then brown tfa« 
top with a salamander : or in scallops. ^ 

Carrots 
Hequire a good deal of boiling : when young, wipe off 
the skin after they are boiled ; when old, boll them with 
the salt meat, and scrape them first. 

To stew Carrots. 
Half-boil, then nicely scrape, and slice them into a 
stew-pan. Put to them half a tea-cupful of any weak 
broth, some pepper and salt, and half a cupful of cream : 
simmer them till they are very tender, l>ut not broken.. 
Before serving, rub a very little flour,, with a bit of butter, 
and warm up with then), if approved, -cjiopped- parsley 
may be added ten minutes before ser\'ed. •' > ■

To pickle young Cucumbers* 

Choose nice young gcrkins, spread ihera on dishes, 8^ 
them and let them lie a week — drain them, and, putting 
them in ajar, pour boiling vinegar over them* Set them 
near the fire, covered with plenty of vine leaves ; if they 
do not become a tolerably goo<l green, pour the vinegar 
into another jar, set it over the hot hearth, and when it 
boils, pour it over them again, covering with fresh 
leaves; and thus do till they are of as good a colour as 
you wish : — but as it is now known that the ver}" fine green 
pickles are made so by using brass or bell-metal vessels, 
which, when vinegar is put into them, become highly 
poisonous, few people like to eat them. 

To pickk JValnuii, 

AVhen they will bear a pin to go into them, put ft ferise 
of salt andj.water boiled, and strong enough to bear*an 
rgi5 on them, being quite cold first. It must be well 
skimmed while lyoiling. Let them soak six days ; then 
change the brine, let them stand six more ; then drain 
them, and pour over them in the jar a pickle of the best 
while wine vinegar, with a good quantity of pepper, pi- 
mento^ ging<?r, mace, cloves, mustard^seed, and horse- 
radish ; all boiled together, but cold. To every hundred 
of walnuts put six spoonfuls of mustard-seed, and twe 
or thrcje heads of garlick or shalot, but the latter is least 
strong. 

Thus done, tbey will be good for several years, if close 
covered. The air will soften them. Tbey will not be 
fit to eat under six months.' 

The pickle will serve as good ketchup* when the wal- 
nuts are used. 

Anoihtr way —Put them into ajar, cover them with 
the best vinegar cold, let them stand four months ; then 
pour off the pickle, and boil as much fresh vinegar as 
ybill cover the walnuts, adding to every three quarts of 
:^i0egar one quarter pound of best Durham mustarti^. ^

^If-ounce of allspice, and a good handful of salt — pour 
the whole, boiling hot, upon the walnuts, and cover 
them close; they, will be fit for use in three or four 
ndnths. You may add two ounces of garlick, or shalot, 
but not boiled in the vinegar. 

• Of the pickle in which the walnuts stood for the first 
four iponths, you may make excellent ketchup. 

^n exeisUent xixiy to pickle Mushrooms, to preserve tlic

] 'Btitfdns must be rubbed with a bit of flannel and salt ; 
ai^lJTi^om the larger, take out the red inside, for when 
fhey^SLie bktck they will not do, being too old. Throw 
a little salt over, and put them into a stew-pan with some 
mace and pepper ; as the liquor comes out, shake them 
well; and keep them over a gentle fire till all of it be 
flried)into them again ; then put as much vinegar into the 
pan as ( will cover them, give it one warm, and turn all 
into a. glass, or stone jar. They will keep two. years, and 
are delicious. 

/^ ''' ' To pickle Red Cabbage, 

'Slici^ it into a colander, and sprinkle each layer with 
salt J jet it drain two days, then put it into a jar, and 
pour boiling vinegar enough to cover, and put a few 
slices of red beet- root. Observe to choose the purple 
red cabbage. Iliose who like the flavour of spice wijl 
bpU it with ths; vinegar. Cauliflower cut in branches, an'd 
thrown in after being salted, will look of a beautiful red.

again with ftome fresh, spice, and it will then keep «. 
twelvemonth. 

Afushroom Ketchup, another xcay. 

Take a stew-pan hill of the large-flap mushrooms, that 
are not worm-eaten, and the skins and fringe of those yoa 
have pickled ; throw a handful of salt among them, and 
set them by a slow fire ; they will produce a great deal 
of liquor, which you must strain ; and put to it four oun- 
ces of shalots, two cloves of garlick, a good deal of pepper, 
ginger, mace, cloves, and a few bay -leaves — boil and skim 
very well. M'hen cold, cork close. Jn t\i'o months boll 
it up again with a little fresh spice, and a stick of horse- 
radish, and it will then keep the year; which mushroom 
ketchup rarely does, if not boiled a second tiuEie*. -, 
IValnut Ketchup of the finest sort, ., , 

Boil or simmer a gallon of the expressed juice of wa)^ 
nuts when they are tender, and skim it well ; then p,vl 
in two pounds of anchovies, bones and liquor, ditto, of 
shalots, one ounce of cloves, ditto of mace, ditto of pep* 
per, and one clove of garlick. Let all shnmer till the 
shalots sink: then put the Hquor into a pan till cold; 
bottle, and divide the spice to each. Cork closely, and 
tie a bladder over. . ,;. 

It will keep twenty years, and is not good the fintr- 
Be very careful to express the juice at home; for itil 
rarely unadulterated, if bought. 

Some people make liquor c^the outside shell when the 
nut is ripe; but neither the flavour nor colour is then so 
fine. 

Cockle Ketchup, 

Open the cockles, scald them in their own liquor; add

To prepare Ice for Iceing. 
Get a few pounds of ice, break it almost to powder, 
throw a. large handful and a half of salt among it. You

ice and salt being in a bucket, put your cream into an 
ice-pot, and cover it ; immerse it in the ice, and draw 
.thatjround the pot, so as to touch every. possible part 
In a few minutes put a spatula or spoon in, and stir, it 
well, removhig the parts that ice round the edges to the 
centre. If the ice-cream, or water be in a form, shut 
' the bottom close, and move the whole in the ice, as you 
' cannot use a spoon to that without danger of waste. 
'There should be holes in the bucket, to let off the ice 
as it thaws. 

Note. When any fluid tends towards cold, the mov- 
' ing il qliickly accelerates the cold ; and likewise, when 
any fluid is tending to heat, stirring it will fiiciiitate its 
boiling.

or any other ba.«e, must be put into a small dh>h ; thci 
make rows round it wide at bottom, and gro\^ing smaUer 
towards tiie top ; choosing such of the ingredients for 
each row as will most vary the colours. At the top a little 
sprig of curled parsley may be stuck in ; or, without any 
thing on the dish, the salmagundy may be laid in rows, 
or put into the half-whites of eggs, which may be made 
to stand upright by cutting offa little bit at the round end. 
In the latter case, each half egg has but one ingredient 
.Curled butter and parsley may be put as garnish be- ] 
tween. 

Macaroni as usually served. 

Boil it in milk, or a weak veal broth, pretty well fla- 
voured with salt. When tender, put it into a dish with- 
out the liquor, and among it put some bits of butter and 
grateil cheese, and over fiie top grate more, and a little 
more butter. Set the dish into a Dutch oven a quarter 
of an hour, but do not let the top become hard. 

Another way. — ^Wash it well, and simmer in half milk, :; 
and half broth of veal or mutton, till it is tender. To a ' 
spoonful of this liquor, put the yolk of an egg beaten in 
a spoonful of cream ; just make it hot to thicken, but not 
boil: put it over the macaroni, and then grate fine old 
cheese all over, and bits of butter. Brown with the sala- 
mander. 

Another. — Wash the macaroni, then dimmer it in a lit- 
tle brotli, witii a little pounded mace and salt. When 
quite tender, take it out of the liquor, lay it in a dish, 
grate a good deal of chieese over, then cover that with 
bread grated fine. Warm some butter without oilihg> 
and pour it from a boat through a little earthen colander 
all over the crumbs, then put the dish in a Dutch oven, 
to roast the cheese, and brown the bread of a fine co- 
lour. The bread should be in separated crumbs, and 
look light. 

Omkt.

put to it dropped parfdey, green onions, or cbiv«8, (the

pepper, salt, and a scrape or two of nutmeg. Alsikesome 
butter boil in a small frying-paR, and pour the above bat- 
ter into it ; when one side is of a fine yellow brown, turn 
it and do the other. Double it when served. Some 
scraped lean ham, or grated tongue, put in at first, is a 
▼ery pleasant addition. Four eggs will make a pretty 
sized omlet ; but many ceoks will use eight or ten. A 
small proportion oif flour should be used. 

If the taste be approved, slHuU taragon gives a fine fla* 
vour. A good deal of parsley should be used. 

Ramakins and omlet, though usually served in the 
course, would be much better if they were sent up aflej 
that they might be eaten as hot as possible. 



Butter to serve as a Utile Disk 

Boll butter in different forms; either like a pine, 
make the marks with a tea-spoon, or roll it in crimping 
rollers, work it through a colander, or scoop with a ienh 
^poon, and mix with grated beef; tongue, or ancbovies« 
Make a wreath of curled parsley to gtf nidi. 

Ramakins. 

Scrape a quarter of a pound of Cheshire, and ditto oj 
Gloucester cheese, ditto of good fresh butter ; then beat 
aW in a mortar with the yolks of four eggs, and the inside 
of a small 'T*rench roll boiled m cream till soft ; mix llie 
paste then with the whites of the eggs previously beaten, 
and put into small paper pans made rather long than 
square, and bake in a Dutch oven till of a fine brown. 
They should be eaten quite hot. Some like the addition 
of a glass of white wine. 

The batter for ramakins is equally good over macaroni 
vhen boiled tender ; or on stewed brocoli, celery, or 
cauliflower, a little of the gravy they have been stewed 
in being put in the dish with them, but not enough to 
make the vegetable swim.

A& soon as it comes in, choose the firmest parjf, and 
pick free from skin and veins. In a very nice sauc^-pan* 
set it at some distance from the fice, that it may melfr. 
without frying, or it will taste. 

When melted, pour it into a pan of coljl water. Wheni 
in a hard cake, wipe it very dry, fold it in fine paper^ 
and then in a linen bag, and keep in a dry but not hot- 
place. When used, scrape it fine, and it will make a- 
fine crust, either with or without butter.

with vine-leaves under and over, into a block-tih ^te* 
serring-pan, with spring-water to cover them, an«l mtii 
the tin cover to exclude all air. Set it on the side of W 
fire, and when they begin to simmer, take them off, pout' 
off the water, and if not green, put fresh' leaves ^W^h^ 
cold, and repeal the same. Take them out carefiillj^ 
with a slice: they are to be peeled, and then done ac- 
cording to the receipts for the severar modes.

syrup that hangs about it ; put it on a napkin before the 
fire to drain, and then do some more in the sieve. Have 
ready sifted double-refined sugar, which sift over the 
fruit on all sides till quite white. Set it on the shallow 
end of sieves in a lightly-warm oven, and turn it two or 
three times. It must not be cold till dry. Watch it care* 
M\y, and it will be beautiful. 

* To prepare BarberrUifor Tartlets, 

Pick barberries that have no stones, from the stalks, 
and to every pound weigh three quarters of a pound of 
lump-sugar ; put the' fruit into a stone jar, and either set 
»t on a hot hearth, or in a sauce-pan of water, and let 
them simmer very slowly till soft ; put them and the su- 
r g^f into a preserving-pan, and boil them gently fifteen 
fliinutes. Use no metal but silver. 

Barberries in bunches. 
^ Have ready bits of flat white wood, three inches long» 
and a quarter of an inch wide. Tie the stalks of the 
fruit on the stick from within an inch of one end to be* 
yond the other, so as to make them look handsome. 
Simmer them in some syrup two successive days, cover- 
iJig them each time with it when cold. When they look 
clear they are simmered enough. The third day, do 
them like other candy fruit, see receipt for it above. It 
is at the top of this page.

To preserve green Apricots, 
Lay vine or apricot leaves at the bottom of your ptf» 
then fruit, and so alternately till full, the upper laytf 
being thick with leaves ; then fill with spring water, u& 
cover down, that no steam may come out. Set the pas 
lit a distance from the fire, that in four or five houn tbtif 
may be only soft, but not cracked. Make a tliin lyrop 
of some of the water, and drain the fruit. When both 
are cold, put the fruit into the pan, and the syrup to it; 
put the pan at a proper distance from tlie fire till the apri- 
cots green, bat on no account boil or crack; remove 
them very carefully into a pan with the syrup for two s€ 
three days; then pour off as much of it as will be neces- 
sary, and boil with more sugar to make a rich syrup, and 
put a little sliced ginger into it. Wl en cold, and the ihih 
synip has all been drained from the fruit, pour the thick

as above. Twice heating, an hour each time, will do 
them. 
Put them in a box, with a paper between eacii layer. 

To dry Cherries the best way. 
To every five pounds of cherries stoned, weigh oncoC 
sugar double-refined- Put the fruit into the preserving- 
pan with very little water, make both scalding hot: 
take the fruit immediately out and dry them ; put tbcm 
into the pan again, strewing the sugar between each 
layer of cherries ; let it stand to melt; then set the pan 
on the fire, and make it scalding hot as before; take it 
off, and repeat this thrice with the sugar. Drain them 
from the syrup; and lay them singly to dry on dishes, 
in the sun or on a stove. When dry, put them into a 
sieve, dip it into a pan of cold water, and draw it in- 
stantly out again, and pour themona^fine soft cloth; 
dry them, and spt them once more in the hot sun, or on 
a stove. Keep them in a box, with layers of white paper, 
in a dry place. This way is the best to give plumpness to 
the fruit, as well as colour and flavour.

Observe that the colour be fine from the first, or the 
fruit will not afterwards gain it; and use as little of the 
cochineal as « ill serve, lest the syrup taste bitter. 

Dried Jppies* 

Pot them in a cool oven six or seven times, and flattn 
them by degrees, and gently, when soft enougli to bear

The biffin, the minshul crab, or any tart apples, are 
the sorts for drying. 

To preserve J£trganel Pears most beautifully. 

Pare them very thin, and simmer in a thin^ syrujt ; let 
them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, and sim- i 
mer again ; and repeat this till they are clear ; then drain, 
and dry them in the sun or a cool oven a very little time. 
They may be kept in syrup, and dried as wanted, which 
makes them more moist and rich. 

Gooseberry Jam for Tarts, 

Put twelve pounds of the red hairy gooseberries, when 
ripe and gathered in dry weather, into a preserving- pan, 
with a pint of currant-juice, drawn as for jelly; let theni i 
boil pretty quick, and beat them with the spoon ; when 
they begin to break, put to them six pounds of pure 
white Lisbon sugar, and simmer slowly to a jam. It re- ! 
quires long boiling, or will not keep ; bnt is an excel- 
lent and: 'reasonable thing for tarts or puffs. Look at 4t i 
in two or tlil^ee days, and if the syrup and fruit separate, 
the whole must be boiled longer. Be careful it doesn^t 
burn to the bottom. 

Another, — Gather your gooseberries (the dear white 
or green sort) when ripe ; top and tail, and weigh them ; 
a pound lo three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and 
half a pint of wat^r ; boil and skim the sugar and water; 
then put the fruit, and boil gently till clear; then break 
and put into small pots.

H^hite Gooseberry Jarn. 

Gather the (inest white gooseberries, or green if you 

choose, wlien just ripe; t4»p and tall thein. To each 

p6und put three quarters of a pound of fine sugar, and 

half a pint of water. Boil and darify the sugar in the 

;water as directed in page 208 ; then add the fruit ; sim- 
mer gently till clear, then break it, and in a few minutes 
put the jam into small pots. 

Gooseberry Hops. .,.. 

Of the largest green walnut kind, take and cut the bud 
end in four quarters, leaving the stalk end whole; pick 
out the seeds, and with a strong needle and thread fasten 

.fire^r six together, by running the thread through the 
bottoms, till they are of -the size of a hop. Lay vine- 
leaves at the bottom of a tin preserving-pan, cover them 
with the hops, then a layer of leaves, and so on ; lay a 
good many on the top, then fill Uie pan with water. Stop 
it so close down that no steam can get out, set it by a 
slow fire till scalding hot, then take it off till cold, aiid 
so do till on opening while cold, the gooseberries are of 
a good green. Then drain tliem on sieves, and make a 
thin syrup of a pound of sugar, to a pint of w ater, boil, 
and skim it well ; whea half coldj*. put in the fruit ; next 
day give it one boil ; do this thrice. If the hop» are to 
be dried, which way they eat best, and look well, they 
may be^et to dry in a week : but if to be kept wet, make 
a syrup in the above proportion^, adding a slice of ginger 
in boiling; when skhnmed and clear, give the goose- 
berries one boil, and when cold, ^ur it over them. If 

"the first syrup be found too sour, a little sugar may be 
added and boiled in it, before the hops that are for dry- 
ing have their last boil. 
Tlie extra-syrup will serve for pies, or go towards 

. other sweetmeats. 

Raspberry Jam, 
Weigh equal quantities of fruit and sugar ; put the 
former into a preserving-pan, boil and bres^ it, stir con-* 
8tantly> and let it boil very quickly. Whea most of tiw

Tills way the jam is greatly superior in colour and fla- 
vour to tiiat which is made by putting the sugar in at first. 

Another ivay, — Put the fruit in a jar in a kettle of wa- 
ter, or on a hot hearth, till the juice will run from it, 
then take away a quarter of a pint from every pound of 
fruit ; boil and bruise it half an hour, then put In the 
weight of the fruit m sugar, and, adding the same quan- 
tity of currant-juiee, boil it to a strong jelly. 

The raspberry-juice will serve to put into brandy, or 
may be boiled with Its weight in sugar for making the 
jelly for raspberry-ice or cream. 

To preserve Greengages, 

Choose the largest, when they begin to soften ; split 
them without paring, and strew a part of the sugar which 
you have previously weighed an equal quantity of. 
Blanch the kernels with a small sharp knife. Next day, 
pour the syrup from the fruit, and boil it with the other 
sugar, six or eight minutes, very gently ; skim^ and add 
the plums and kernels. Simmer till clear, taking off 
any scum that rises ; put the fruit singly into small pots, 
and pour the syrup and ' kernels to it. If you woulcl 
candy it, do not add the syrup, but observe the direc- 
tions that will be given for candying fruit ; some may be 
done each way. 

Damson Cheese. 

Bake or boil the fruit in a stone jar in a sauce-pan of 
water, or on a hot hearth. Pour off some of the juice, 
and to every two pounds of fruit weigh half a pound of 
sugar. Set the fruit over a fire in the pan, let it boil 
quickly till it begin to look dry ; take out the stones, and 
add the sugar, stir it well in, and simmer two hours 
slowly, then boil it quickly half an hour, till the sides 6f 
the pan candy; pour the jam then into potting-pans or 
dishes, about an inch thick, so that it may cut firm. " 
the skins be disliked, then the juice is not to be taken . 
out ; but after the first process, the fruit is to be pulped 
through a very coairse sieve with the juice, and managed 
•as above. The stones are to be cracked, or someof thein^ 
and the kernels boiled in the jam. AU the juice may be

pompleted, breaking the lumps of fruit with the presery- 
ingladle. 

This fruit is so hard, that if it be not done as above, it 
requires a great deal of time. 

Stewing quinces in a jar, and then squeezing them 
through a cheese-cloth, is the best method of obtaining 
• the juice to add as above, and dip the cloth in boiling 
water first and wring it.

put to every pint a pound and a half of sugar, the finest ,

which must be covered with a fine linen, to prevent its 
wasting while sifting. Boat the sugar and juice togetheir 
three hours and a h^ilf if a large quantity, but two and a 
half for less ; then drop it on sheets of white thick paper, 
the size of the drops sold in the shops.

sary. To know if there be enough, mix till w ell incor- 
porated, and then drop ; if it run, there is not enougU 
sugar, auJ if there is too much it will be rough. A dry 
room will suffice to drythem. No metal must touch the

observations on Stvettmeats, 
• Sw^pthieats should be kept carefully from the air, and 
in a very dry place. tJnlcss they have a vi^ry small pro- 
p'ortion of sugar, a warm one does not hurt ; but when 
not properly boiled, that is, long enough, but not quick, 
Heat makes them ferment ; and damp causes them to 
grow mouldy. They should be looked at two or three 
times in the first two months, that they may be gently 
boiled again, if not likely to keep. 

It is necessary to observe, that the boiling of sugar 
more or less, constitutes the chief art of the confottiontr; 
and those who are not practised in this knowledge, and 
only preserve in a plain way for family use, are not awaie 
that, in two or three minutes, a syrup over the fire will

tioner^ degrees of boiling, of which there are six,, and

Iftose subdivided. But I am not versed in the minutis, 
yui only make the observation to guard against under- 
jailing, which prevents sweetmeats from keeping ; and 
quick boiling and long, which brings them to candy. 

Attention, without much practice, will enable a person 
(o do any of the following sorts of sweetmeats, &c. and 
Ihey are ias much as is wanted in a private family ; thq 
higher articles of preserved fruits may be bought at less 
^xpence than made. 

Jellies of fruit made with equal quantity of sugar, that 
fe, a pound to a pint, require no very long boilLig. 

A pan should be kept for the purpose of preserving ; 
of double block tin, with a bow-handle opposite the 
itraight one, for safety, will do very well : and if put by 
nicely cleaned, in a dry place, when done with, will last 
lor several years. ' Those of copper or brass are impro- 
per, as the tinning wears out by the scraping of the sweet- 
meat ladle. There is a new sort of iron, with a strong 
finning, which promises to wear long. Sieves and spoons 
should be kept likewise for sweet things. 

Sweetmeats keep best in drawers that are not con- 
nected with a wall. If there be the leasKiamp, cover 
them only with paper dipped in brandy, laid quite close; 
putting a little fresh over in spring, to prevent insect mouldk 

V/hen any sweetmeats are directed tb be dried in the 
sun or in a stove, it will be best in private familes, where 
there is not a regular stove for the purpose, to put them 
iQ the sun on Hag-stones, which reflect the heat, and place 
g garden glass over them to keep insects off*; or if put in 
^n oven, to take care not to*- let it be too warm, and * 
vatch that they do properly and slowly. 

Tchkeep Currant9'

fants be cut from thje large stalks wI'k the smallest bit of 
stalk to each, that the fruit not being wounded no mois-

Stop up the bottles with cork and rosin, and put tbem 
into the trench in the garden with the neck downwards; 
slicks should be placed opposite to where e^ch sort of 
fruit begins. 

Cherries and Damsons keep in thesamtf way. 

Currants may be scalded, as dire ted for gooseberries, 
the hrst method. 

To keep CodHnS'Jbt-siveral months. 
Gather codfins at Midsummer of a middling size, put 
th<*m into an earthen pan, pour boiling water over them, 
an<l cover the pan with cabbage-leaves. Keep thera by 
the fire till they would peel, but don't peel them ; then 
pour the water off till both are quite cold. Place the 
codlins then in a stone jar with a smallish mouth, and 
pour on thfm the water that scalded them. Cover the 
pot with bladder wetted, and tied very close, and then 
C|jer it coarse paper tied again. 

It is best to keep them in small jars, such as will be 
used at once when opened. 

To keep Gooseberries. 

Before they become too large, let them be gathered, 
and take care not to cut them in taking off the stalks and 
buds. Fill wide-mouthed bottles ; put the corks loosely 
in, and set the bottles up to the neck in water in a boiler, 
^hen the fruit looks scalded, take them out ; and when 
perfectly cold, cork close, and rosin the top. Dig^ 
trei^ch in a part of tlie garden least used, sufficiently deep 
for all the bottles to stand, and let the earth be thrown 
0¥er, to cover them a foot and a half. When a frost 
comes on, a little fresh litter from the stable will prevent 
the ground from hardening so that the fruit cannot be 
dug up. Or, scald as above ; when cold, fill the bottles 
with cold water, cerk them, and keep them in a damp 
or dry place ; they will not be spoiled. 

Another way, — In the size and preparation as above; 
when done, have boiling water ready, either in a boiler 
or large kettle ; and into it. put as much roach-alura as 
will, when dissolved, Votdeu vViftHt^Vw, N5\skOsi^^>a,^Ul

*tete by a little roughness ; if tliere be too much it will 
spoil the fniit. Put as many gooseberries into a large 
sieve as ^jll lie at the bottom without covering one an- 
other. Hold the sieve in the water till the fruit begins to 
look scalded op the outside ; then turn them gently out 
of the sieve on a cloth on the dresser, cover them with 
another cloth, and put some moi*e to be scalded, and so 
on till all be finished. Observe not to put one quantity 
on another, or they willbeebme too soft. The next day 
pick out any bad or broken one«, bottle the rest, and fill 
up the bottles with the alum-water in which they were 
scalded; which must be kept in the bottles ; for U left in 
the kettle, or in a glazed pan, it will spoil. Stop them 
close. 

The water must boil all the time the process is carry iog 
on. Gooseberries done this way make as fine tarts as 
fresh off the trees. 

Another way, — In dry weather pick the gooseberries 
that are full grown, but not ripe ; top and tail them, and 
put into open-m »uthed bottles; gently cork them with 
new velvet corks ; put them in the oven when the bread 
is drawn, and let them stand till shrunk a quarter part ; 
take them out of the oven, an»l immediately beat the 
corks in tight, cut od the tops, and rosin down close ; 
set them in a dry place ; and if well secured from air they 
will keep the year round. 

If gathered in the damp, or the gooseberries' skins arc 
the least cut in taking oli' the stalks and buds, they will 
mould. The hairy sort only must be used for keeping, 
and do them before the seeds become large. 

Currants and damsons may be done the same. 

To keep Damsons for winter Pies. 

Put them in small stone jars, or wide-mouthed bottles ; 
set..them up to their necks in a boiler of cold, water, and 
lighting a fire under, scald them. Next day, when per- 
fectly cold, fill up with spring water ; cover them.

If too sweety mix with it some of the fruit that is dootf 
^ ithout iugstr. 

Another way, — Choose steen-pots if you ean get them, 
which are of equal size top and bottom (they should bold 
eight or nine pounds) ; put the fruit in about a quarter 
up, (hen strew in a quarter of the sugar; then another 
quantity of fruit, and so till all of both are in. The pro- 
portion of sugar is to be three pounds to nine pounds of 
fi-uit. Set the jars in the oyen^ and bake the fruit quite 
through. When cold, put a piece of clean-scraped stick 
into the middle of the jar, and let the upper part stand 
art)Ove the top ; then pour melted mutton-suet over the 
top, full half an inch thicks having previously covered 
the fruit with white paper. Keep the jars in a cool dry 
place, ahd use the suet as a cover ; wiiich you will draw 
up by the stick, minding to leave a little forked branch 
to it to prevent its slipping out. 

To preserve Fruit for To.rti^ or Family-deserts, 

Cherries, plums of all sorts, and American apples, ga- 
ther when ripe, and lay them in small jars that will hold 
a poimd ; strew over each jar six ounces of good loaf- 
sugar pounded ; cover with two bladders each, separately 
tied down ; then set the jars in a large stew-pan of water 
up t6 the neck, and let it boil three hours gently. Keep 
these and all other sorts of fruit free from damp. 

To keep Lemon-juice. 

Buy the fruit when cheap, keep it in a cool place two 
or three days, if too unripe to squeeze readily ; cut the 
peel off some, and roll them under your hand to make 
them part with the juice more readily ; others you may 
leave unpared for grating, when the pulp shall be taken 
out and dried. Squeeze the juice into a China-basin; 
then strain itthrou^ some muslin, which will not permit 
the least pulp to pass. Have re^dy half and quartet

OhseroaHons on makit^ and baking Cakes. 

'Currants should be very nicely washed, dried in a 
cloth, and then set before the fire. If damp they will 
make cakes or puddingy heavy. Before they are added, 
a dust of dry flour should be thrown among them, and 
a sliake given to them^ which causes the thing that they 
*re put to, to be lighter. 

. E^gs should be very long beaten, whites anH yolks 
apart, and always strained. . 

Sugar should be rubbed to a powder on a clean board, 
and sifted through a very fine hair or lawn-sieve. 

Lemon-peel should be pared very thin, arfd with a 
little sugar beaten in a malrble mortar to a paste, and then 
mixed with a iittle wine, or cream, so as to divide easily 
among the other ingredients. 

. After all the articles are put into the pan, they should 
be thoroughly and long beaten, as the lightness of the 
cake depends much on their being well incorporated. 
Whether black or white plum-cakes, they require less

btJltw and egfp for having yeast, and cat equally 11^ 
and rich. If the leaven be only of Hour, milk and watery 
and Yca<t, it becomes more tough, and is less easily di- 
vided, than if the butter he iirst put with those ingre- 
dients, and the dough afterwards set to rise by the lire. 

The heat of the oven is of great importance for cako^ 
especially those that are large. If not pretty quick, tlx 
batter will not rise. Should you fear its catching ^ 
being too quick, put some paper over the cake to pre- 
vent its being burnt. If not long enough lighted to hate I 
n bo<ly of heat, or it is become slack, the cake will be 
l)cavy. To know when it is soaked, take a broad-blaiM 
kniie that is very bright, and plunge into the very 
centre, draw it instantly out, and if the least stickintfss 
adheres, put the cake immediately in, and shut up the 
oven. 

It the heat was sufficient to raise, but not to soak, I 
have with great success had fresh fuel quickly put in, 
and kept the cakes hot till tiie oven was fit to liitish the 
soaking, and they turned out extremely well. But those 
who are employed, ought to be particularly careful that 
1)0 mistake occur from negligence when large cakes are 
to be baked. 

Iceing for Cakes. 

For a large one, beat and sift eight ounces of fine 
sugar, put into a mortar with four spoonfuls of rose-water, 
and the whites of two eggs beaten and strained, 'whi^kit 
well, and when the cake is almost cold, dip a feather in 
the iceing, and cover the cake well ; set it in the oven to 
harden, but don't let it stay to discolour. Put the cake 
into a dry place. 

To ice a very large Cake, 

Beat the whites of twenty fresh eggs ; then by degrees 
beat a pound of double-rehned sugar sifted through a 
lawn-sieve ; mix these well in a deep earthen pan ; add 
orange-flower water, andi a piece of fresh lemon-peel ; 
of the former enough to flavour, and no more. Whisk

By the addition of an ounce of butter, or sugar, or an 
'*gg or two, you may make the cake the better. A tea-

bake it in a pan, rather than as a loaf, the outside being 
-less hard.

and pour it through, having £rst mixed a little warm 
water with it 

To make Bread, 

Let flour be kept fpur or ^ve weieks before it is begun 
to bake witlL Put half a bushel of good flour into a 
trough, or kneading-tub ; mix ^ith it between four and 
five quarts of warm water, and a pint and a half of good 
yeast y put it into the flour, and stir it well with your 
Bands till it becomes tough. Let it rise about an hour 
and twenty minutes, or less if it rises fast ; then, before 
it falls, add four quarts more of warm water, and half a 
pound of salt ; work it well, and cover it with a cloth. 
Put the Are then into the oven ; and by the time it is 
warm enou^, the dough will be ready. Make the 
loaves about five pounds each ; sweep out the oven very 
dean and quick, and put in the bread ; shut it up close, 
and two hours and a half will bake it In summer the 
water should be milk- warm, in winter a little more, and 
in frosty weather as hot as you can well bear your hand 
in, but not scalding, or the whole will be spoiled. If 
baked in tins, the crust will be very nice. 
. The oven should be round, hot long ; the roof from 
twenty to twenty-four inches high, the mouth small, and 
the door of iron, to shut close. This construction will 
save firing and time, and bake better than long and high- 
roofed ovens. 

Rolls, muffins, or any sort of bread, may be made to 
taste new when t^o or three days old, by dipping them 
UBGUt in water, and baking afresh or toasting. 

American Flour 

Requires almost twice as much water to make it Into 
bread as is used for English flour, and therefore it is more 
pr<^table ; for a stone of the American, which weighs 
fourteen pounds, will make twenty-one pounds and a 
half of bread, but the best sojrl^ of English flour produces 
only eighteen pounds and a half.

C44 DOMESTIC COOKEBT. 

The Reverend Mr. HaggefM ecomomkal Bread. 

Only the coarse flake-bran is to be reinoTed from the 
flour; of this take five pounds, and boil it in rather more 
than four gallons of water ; so that when perfectly smootli, 
you may have three gallons and three quarts of bran-water 
clear. WKh this knead ifty-six pounds of the flour, add- 
ing salt and yeast in the same way and proportions u for 
other bread. When ready to bake, divide it into loavesv 
and bake them two hours and a half. 

Thus made, flour will imbibe three <]uarts more of 
bran- water than of plain ; so that it not only produces t 
more nutritious substantial food, but makes an increase 
of one-fifth of the usual quantity of bread, which is t 
saving of one day's consumption out of six ; and if this 
was adopted throughout the kingdom, it would make a 
saving of ten millions sterling a year, when wheat was at 
the price it stood in the scarcity, reckoning the con- 
sumption to be two hundred thousand bushels a day. 
The same quantity of flour which, kneaded with water, 
produces sixty-nine pounds eight ounces of bread, will, 
in the abo\*e way, make eighty-three pounds eight ounces, 
and gain fourteen pounds. At the ordinary price of flour 
four millions would be saved. When ten days old, if 
put into the oven for twenty minutes, thb bread wUl ap- 
pear quite new again. 

Rice-and-zvkeat Bread. 

Simmer a pound of rice in two quarts of water till it 
becomes perffecUy soft ; when it is of a proper warmth, 
mix it extremely well with four pounds of flour, and 
yeast and salt as for other bread ; of yeast about four 
large spoonfuls ; knead it extremely well ; tlien set it to 
rise before the Are. Some of the flour should be re- 
served to make up the loaves. The whole expense, fn« 
eluding baking, will not exceed three shillings, for 
which eight pounds and a half of exceeding good bread 
will be produced. If the rice should require more water, 
k must be added^ as some rice swells more than others. 



BREAD; &C. 245 

; French Bread, 

With a quarter of a peck of tine flour mix the yolks of 
|:hree and whites of two eggs, beaten and strained, a little 
salt, half a pint of good yeast that is not bitter, and ai • 
much milk, made a little warm, as will work into a thin 
Jight dough. Si^ir it about, but don't knead it. Have 
jeady three quart wooden dishes, divide the dough among 
them, set to rise, then turn them out into the oven, which 
must be quick. Rasp when done. 

n discovci- xohcther Bread has been adulterated with 
I xvhiting or chalk. 

Mix it with lemon-juice, or strong vinegar, and if this 
puts it into a state of fenwentation, you may be certain it 
lias a mixture of alkaline particles; and these are some- 
tunes in large quantities in bakers' bread. 

To detect Bones, Jalap, Ashes, Sfc. in Bread, 

Slice a large loaf very thin, the crumb only; set it 
brer the fire with water, and let it boil gently a long 
time ; take it ofif, and pour the water into a vessel ; let 
it stand till near cold ; then pour it gently out, and in the 
sediment will be seen the ingredients which have been 
mixed. The alum wUl be dissolved in the water, and 
may be extracted from it. If jalap has been used, it will 
form a thick film at top, and the heavy ingredients will 
sink to the bottom. 

Excellent Rolls, 

Warm one ounce of butter in half a pint of milk, put 
to it a spoonful and a half of yeast of small beer, and 4 
little salt. Put two pounds of. flour into a pan, and mix 
in the above. Let it rise an hour ; knead it well ; mak« 
into seven rolls, and bake in a quick oven. 

If made in cakes three inches thick, sliced and but- 
tered, they resemble Sally Lumm's, as made at Bath. 

The foregoing receipt, wjth the' addition of a little 
saffron boiled in half aiea-cupfuiof milk, makes them re- 
* markably good.

To brexv very fine JFelch Ale, 

POUR forty-two gallons of water hot^ but not quite 
boiling, on eight bushels of malt, cover, and let it stand 
three hours. In the mean time infuse four pounds of 
bops in a little hot v^ter, and put the water and hops into 
the tub, and run the wort upcni them, and bml them toge- 
ther three hours. Strain off the hops, and keep for the 
small beer. Let the wort stand in a high tub till cool 
enough to receive the yeast, of which put two quarts of 
ale, or if you cannot get it, of small beer yeast. Mix it 
thoroughly and often. When the wort has d one working, 
the second or third day, the yeast will sink rather than 
rise in the middle, remove it then, and tun the ale as it 
works out ; pour a quart in at a time, and gently, to 
prevent the fermentation from continuing too long, which 
weakens the liquor. Put a bit of paper over the bung- 
hole two or three days before stopping Vkp«

Stroffg Beer, or Me. 

Twelve butheh of malt to the hogshead for beer, (tf 
ftHirteen if you wish H of a Tery good body) eight for lie; '^ 
for cithiT pour the whole quantity of water hot, batMt 
boilinij, on at once, and let it infiise three hours ckls^ 
covered ; mash it in the first half hour, and let it ft^ 
Ihe leiDaioder of the time. Run it on the hops previoiW' 
ly infused in watvr ; for strong beer three quarters of t 
pound to a bushel ; if for ale, half a pound. Boil tlim 
with the wort two hours from the time it begins to boil 
Cool a pailful to ziU\ three quarts of yeast to, which «iB 
prepare it for putting to the rest when ready next day; 
but if possible put together the same night. Tun as usdak 
Cover the bung-hole inith paper when the beer has done 
working; and when it is to be stopped, have ready a 
pound and a half of hops dried before the fire, put them 
into the bung-hole, and fasten it up. ^ 

Let it stand twelve months in casks, and twelve in bot- 
tles before it be drank. It will keep, and be very fine, 
eight or ten years. It should be brewed the beginning 
of March. 

Great care must be taken that the bottles are perfectly 
prepared, and that the corks are of the best sort. 

The ale will be ready in three or four months ; and if 
the vent-peg be never removed, it will have spirit and 
ttrength to the very last Allow two gallons of water at 
fiflH fot waste. 

After the beer or ale is run from the grains, pour a 
jMgshead and a half for the twelve bushels, and a hogs- 
bead of water if eight were brewed ; mash, and let stand, 
and Clieo hdl, &c. Use some of the hops for this table- 
beer that were boiled for the strong. 

When thunder or hot weather causes beer to turn sour, 
a tea-apoonful, or more, if required, of salt of woimwood 
put into the jug will rectify it. Let it be drawn just be- 
fore it is dnmk, or it v ill taste flat. 

Excellent Table Beer. 

On three bushels of malt pour of hot watef the third of 
the quantity you are to use, which it to be thirty-nioe 



ItOHrS-BREWBRt. 240 

IpUons. Corer it warm half an hour, then mash, an4 
let it stand two hours and a half more, then set it to drain. 
When dry, add half the remainiog water, mash, and let 
it stand half an hour, run that into another tub, and pour 
|he rest of the water on the malt, stir it well, and corer 
it, letting it infuse a full hour. Run that off, and mix all , 
together. A pound and a half of hop<( should be infused 
in water, as in the former receipt, and be put into the tub 
for the first running. 

Boil the hops with the wort an hour from the time it 
first boils. Strain off and cool. If the whole be not cool 
enough that day to add to the .yeast, a pail or two of wort 
may be prepared, and a quart of yeast put to it over 
night Before tunning, all the wort should be added to- 
gether, and thoroughly mixed with the lade-pail. When 
the wort ceases to work, put a bit of paper on the bung- 
hole for three days, when it may be ssdely fastened close* 
In three or four weeks the beer will be fit for drinking. 

Note, Servants should be directed to put a cork into 
every barrel as soon as the cock is taken out, and to 
fasten in the vent-peg, the air causing casks to become 
musty. 

To refine Beer, Ale, Wine, or Cyder, 
Put two ounces of isinglass shavings to soak in a quart 
of the liquor that you want to clear, beat it with a whisk 
every day till dissolved. Draw off a third part of the 
cask, and mix the above with it : likewise a quarter of 
an ounce of pearl-ashes, one ounce of salt of tartar cal- 
cined, and one ounce of burnt alum powdered. Stir it 
well, then return the liquor mto the cask, and stir it with 
a clean stick. Stop, it up, and in a few days it will be 
£ne.

A desert-spoon thrice a day. 

ToprYseire Yeast. 

When you have plenty of yeast, begin to save it in the 
following manner ; whisk it until it becomes thin, then 
take a new large wooden dish, wash it very nicely, and 
when ((uite dry, lay a layer of yeast over the inside with 
a soft brush ; let it dry, then put another layer in the 
same manner, and so do until you have a sufficient qoas- 
tity, observing that each coat dry thoroughly before an- 
other be added. It may be put on two or three inches 
thick, and will keep several months ; when to be used, 
cut a piece out ; stir it in warm water. 

If to be used for brewing, keep it by dipping large 
handfiils of birch tied together ; and when dry, repeat the 
dipping once. You may thus do as many as you please; 
but take care that no dust comes to them, er the vessel 
in which it has been prepared as before. When the wort 
is set to work, throw into it one of these bunches, and it 
will do as well as with fresh yeast ; but if mixed witb a 
small quantity first, and then added to the whole, it will 
work sooner. 

Remarks on English IFines. 
English wines would be found particularly useful, now 
foreign are so high-priced ; and though sugar is dear, 
tney nuy be made at a quarter of the expense. If care- 
fully made, and kept' three or four years, a proportion- 
able strength being given, they would answer the purpose 
of foreign wines for health, and cause a very considerable 
reduction in the expenditure.

Jloney is a fine ingredient to assist, and render palata- 
ble, new crabbed austere cyder. 

Raspberry JFine. 

To every quart of well-picked raspberries put a quart 
of water ; bruise, and let thein stand two days ; strain off 
the liquor, and to every gallon put three pounds of lump 
sugar ; when dissolved put the liquor in a barrel, and 
vberi fine, which will be in about two months, bottle it, 
aod to each bottle put a spoonful of brandy, or a glass of 
wine. 

Raspberry or Currant Wine. 

To every three pints of fruit, carefully cleared from 
mouldy or bad, put one quart of water ; bruise the for- 
mer. In twenty-four hours strain the liquor, and put to 
every quart a pound of sugar, of good middling quality 
of Lisbon. If for white currants, use lump-sugar. It is 
best to put the fruit, &c. in a large pan, and when in 
three or four days the scum rises, take that off before the 
liquor be put into the barrel. 

Those who make from thnr own gardens, may not 
have a sufficiency to fill the barrel at once ; the wine 
will not be hurt if made in the pan, in the above propor- 
tions, and added as the fruit ripens, and can be gathered 
in dry weather. Keep an account of what is put iu each 
time. 

Another way, — Put fkve quarts of currants, and a pint 
of raspberries, to every two gallons of water ; let them 
soak a night ; then squeeze and break them well. Next 
day rub them well on a fine wire sieve, till all the juice 
is obtsdned,. washing the^kins again with some of the wa» 
ter ; then to every gallon put four pounds of very good

'' If raisin wme be much used, it would answer well to 
keep a cask always for it, and bottle off one year's wine 
just. in time to make the next, which, allowing the six 
months of infusion, would make the wine to be eighteen 
months old. In cyder-counties this way is very econo- 
mical ; and even if not thought strong enough, the addi- 
tkm of another qiiarter of a hundred of raisins would be 
■officientj and the wine would still be very cheap. 
,. When the raisins are pressed through a horse-bair bag, 
tiiey will either produce a good spirit by distillation, and 
mv»t be sent to a chymist who will do it (but if for that 
purpose, they must be very little pressed) ; or they will 
aiike excellent vinegar, on which article see page 1^1. 

The stalks should be picked out for the above, and may 
be thrown into any cask df vinegar that is making ; being 
very acid.

cold water, and add to the brandy after it has stood a 
month on the kernels, and they are strained off; then 
filter through paper, and bottle for use. The leaves of 
peach and nectarines, when the trees are cut in the 
spring, being dibtilled, are am excellent substitute foe

Jn exctUeni Method qf making Punch, 
Take two large fresh lemons with rough skins, quite 
and some large lumps of <louble-refi]H;d sugar. Rub 
^be^Ugar over the lemons till it lias absorbed all the^ yel- 
low {>art of the skins. Then put into the bowl these 
lyxnp&and as much more as the juice of the Wmons may 
be .supposed to require; for no certain weight can be 
■neationedy as the acidity of a lemon cannot be known 
till tried, and therefore this must be determined by the 
taste. Then squeeze the lemon-juice upon the sugar ; 
Bnd with a bruiser press the sugar and tlie juice particu- 
larly well together, for a great deal of the richness and 
fine flavour of the punch depends on this rubbing and 
mixing process bc^g tlioroughly performed! llieu mix 
thfe up veryxoelimih boiling water (soft water is best) 
till the whole is rather cool. When this mixture (which 
b now called the sherbet) is to your taste, take brandy 
tnd mm in equal quantities, and put them to it, mixing 
the whole well together again. The quantity of liquor 
mtist be according to your taste : two good lemons are 
generally enough to make four quarts of punch, includ- 
ing a quart of liquor, with half a pound of sugar ; but this 
d^>ends much on taste, and on the strength of the spirit. 

As the pulp is disagreeable. to some persons, the sher- 
bet may be strained before the liquor is put in. Some 
strain the lemon before they put it to the sugar, which is 
improper ; as, when the pulp and sugar are well mixed 
together, it adds much to' the richness of the punch. 
• iVhen only rum is used, about half a pint of porter 
will soften the punch; and even when both rum aud. 
brandy are used, the porter gives a richness, and to some 
•a very pleasant flavour. 

This receipt has never been in print before, but is 
greatly admired amongst the writer's friends. It is im- 
possible to take too much pains in all the processes of 
mixing, and in minding to do them extremdiy. well, tliat

PART XL 

DAIRY, AND POULTRY. 

DAIRY. 

THE servants of each coontry are generally acquaint- 
ed with the belt mode of managing the batter and cheese 
of that country ; but the following hints may not be un- 
acceptable, to give mformation to the mistress. 

On the Management qf Cotvs, fye. 

Cows should be carefully treated ; if their teats are 
sore, they should be soaked in warm water twice a day, 
and either be dressed with soft ointment, or done with 
spirits and water. If the former, great cleanliness is ne- 
cessary. The milk, at these times, should be given to 
the pigs. 

When the milk is brought into the dairy, it should be 
strained and emptied into -clean pans immediately in 
winter, but not till cool in summer. White ware is pre- 
ferable, as the red is porous, and cannot be so thorough- 
ly scalded. 

The greatest possible attention must be paid to great 
cleanliness in a dairy ; all the utensils, shelves, cfressers, 
and the floor, should be kept with the most perfect neat- 
ness, and cold water'tbrown over every part very often* 
There should be shutters to keep out the sun and the hot 
air. Meat hung in a dairy will spoil milk. 

The cows should be milked at a regular and early 
hour, and the udders emptied, or the quantity will de- 
crease. The quantity of milk depends on many causes ; 
as the goodness, breed, and health of the cow, the pas- 
ture, the length of time from calving, the having plenty 
of clean water in the field she feeds in, &c. A change 



260 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

of pasture will tend to increase it. People who attend 
properly to the dairy will feed the cows particularly well 
two or three weeks before they calve, which makes the 
milk more abundant after. In gentlemens* dairies more 
attention is paid to the size and beauty of the cows than 
to their produce, which dairymen look most to. 

For making cheese the cows should calve from Lady- 
Day to May, that the large quantity of nfilk may come 
into use about the same time ; but in gentlemens' fami- 
lies one or two should calve. in August or September for 
a supply in winter. In good pastures, the average pro- 
duce of a dairy ts about three gallons a day each cow^ 
from Lady-Day to Michaelmas, and from thence to 
Christmas one gallon a day. Cows will be profitable 
milkers to fourteen or fifteen years of age, if of a propdr 
breed. 

When a calf it to be reared, it should be taken frota 
the cow in a week at furthest, or it will cause great trouble 
in rearing, because li will be difficult to make it take 
milk in a pan. Take it from the cow in the morning, snd 
keep it without food till the next morning; and ti}cn» 
being hungry, it will drink without didiculty. Skiminei 
Oiilk and fresh whey, just at warm as new niilkf should 
be given twice a day in such quantity as is required. H 
milk runt short, smooth gruel mixed with milk will dft 
At first, let the calf be out only by day, and feed H it 
night and morning. 

When the family is absent, or there is not a great call 
£or cream, a care^l dairy-maid seizes the opportunity tt 
provide for the winter-store : she should have a book to 
keep an account, or get some one to write down for Mr 
the produce of every week, and set down vrhat butttf 
she pots. The weight the pot will hold should bemarit^ 
ed on each in making at the pottery. In another part of 
the book should be stated the poultry reared in onekiC 
and the weekly consumption in another part

This well-known article <Mtn according to tlie paibtfc

in which the cows feed. Various modes of preparing 
may effect a great deal ; and it will be bad or good of its 
kind, by being in unskilNil hands or the contrary ; but 
much will still depend on the former circumstance. The 
same land rarely makes very fine butter, and remarkably 
fine cheese; yet due care may give one pretty gck>d, 
where the other excels in quality. 

When one is not as fine as the other, attention and 
change of method may amend the inferior. There b 
usually, however, too much prejudice in the minds of 
dairy people, to make them give up an old custom for 
one newly recommended. This calls for the eye of the 
superior. A gentleman has been at the expense of pro- 
caring cattle fi'om every county noted for good cheese, 
and it is afifirmed that the Cheshire, double Gloucester^ 
North Wiltshire, Chedder, and many other sorts are sa 
excellent, as not to discredit their names. As the cows 
are all on one estate, it should seem that the mode of 
making must be a principal cause of the difference in 
ia^Four ; besides, there is much in the size and manner 
of keeping. 

Cheese made on the same ground, of new, skimmed, 
or mixed milk, will differ greatly, not in richness only». 
but ako in taste. Those who direct a dairy in a gentle* 
man's family, should consider in which way it can be 
managed to the best advantage. Even with few cows, 
cbeeses of value may be made from a tolerable pasture, 
by taking the whole of two meals of milk, and propor- 
tioning the thicknes* of the vat to the quantity, rather 
t6aii having a wide and flat one, as the former will be 
most mellow. The addition of a pound of fresh-made 
butter, 4A a good quality^ will cause the cheese made on 
|MMMr land to be of a very different quality from that 
vsaailv produced by it. 

A tew cheeses thus made, when the weather is not 
eactremely hot, and when the cows are m full feed, will 
be very advantageous for the use of the parlour. Cheese 
lor common family use will be very well produced by 



262 DOMESTIC COOKBB.Y. 

two meals of skim, and one of new milk ; or in good 
land, by the skim-milk only. Butter likewise slioold be 
made, and potted down for wintei>use, but not to inte^ 
fere with the cheese as above, which will pot take much 
time. 

To prepare Rennet t9 turn the Milk. 

Take out the stomach of a calf as soon as killed, and 
scour it inside and out with salt, after it is cleared of the 
curd always found in it Let it drain a few hours ; tben 
sew it up with two good handfuls of salt in it, or stretch 
it on a stick well salted ; or keep it in the salt wet, sod 
soak a bit, which will do over and over by fresh water. 

Another tiMzy.— Clean the maw as above ; next day 
take two quarts of fresh spring-water, and put into it a 
handful of hawthorn-tops, a handful of sweet*briar, a 
handhil of rose-leaves, a stick of cinnamon, forty cloves, 
four blades of mace, a sprig of knotted maijoram, and 
two large spoonfuls of salt Let them boil'gently to duve 
pints of water; strain it off; and when only milk-warm, 
pour it on the veil (that \s, the maw). Slice a lemoo 
into it ; let it stand two days ; strain it again, and bottle 
it for use. It will keep good at least twelve m<»itlis,aiKl 
has a very fine flavour. You may add any sweet aro- 
matic herbs to the above. It must be pretty salt* but 
not brine. A little will do for turning. Sal( the vdi 
again for a week or two, and dry it stretched on sticks 
crossed, and it will be near as strong as ever. DooH keep 
it in a hot place when dry. 

To make Cheeese, ^ 

Put the milk into a large tub, warming a piut till it is 
of a degree of heat quite equsd to new ; if too hot tbe 
cheese will be tough. Put in a» much rennet as will turn 
it, and cover it over. Let it stand till completely tuned ; 
then strike the curd down several times with the skin- 
ming dish, and let it separate, still covering it. There 
are two modes of breaking the curd ; and there will be a 
difference m the taste of the cheese, according as either 
is observed ; one is, to gather it with the hands vciy 




DAIRY. 263 

-fpmtly towards the side of the tub> letting the whey pass 
trough the fingers till it is cleared, and lading it off as 
^collects. The other <is« to get the whey from it by 
fagl y breaking the curd ; the last method deprives it of 
3naiiy of its oily particles, and is therefore less proper. 

Put the vat on a ladder over the tub, and fill it with 
ijpju'd by the skimmer : press the curd close with your 
], and add more as it sinks ; and it must be finally 
two inches above the edge. Before the vat is filled, 
cheese-cloth must be Isud at the bottom ; and when 
\, drawn smooth over on all sides. 
There are two modes of salting cheese ; one by mixing 
BJIljii^the curd while in the tub aSer the whey is out ; and 
^jtbm- other by putting it in the vat, and crumbling the curd 
i^ to pieces with it, after the first squeezing with the 
MmA has dried it. The first method appears best •n 
IppiBie accounts, but not on all, and therefore the custom 
J iff file country must direct Put a board under and over 
r.'0ke vat, and place it in the press: in two hours turn it 
'uW^ and put a fresh cheese-cloth ; press it again for eight 
^traine hours ; then salt it all over, and turn it again in 
4bc vat, and let it stand in the press fourteen or sixteen 
iMHifSy observing to put the cheeses last made under- 
most. Before putting them the last time into the vat, 
pare the edges if they do not look smooth. The vat 
should have holes at the sides and at bottom to let all the 
whey pass through. Put dn clean boards, and change 
and scald them. 

To preserve Cheese sownd. 
. . Wash in warm whey, when yo^ have any, and wipe it 
OD^e a month, and keep it on a rack. If you want to 
. ripen it, a damp cellar will bring it forward. When a 
whole cheese is cut, the larger quantity should be spread 
with butter inside,, and the outside wiped, to preserve it. 
To keep those in daily use,' moist, let a clean cloth be 
wrung out from cold water, and wrapt round them when 
carried from table. Dry cheese may be used to advan- 
tage to grate for serving with macaroni or eating without 
These observations are made with a view to make the 



964 DOMESTIC C09KE&Y. 

above articles less expensive, as in most &inilies where 
much is used there b waste. 

To make Sage Cheen. 
Bruise the tops of young reel sage in a mortar, with 
tome leaves of spinach, and squeeze the juice; mix it 
with the rennet in the milk, more or less according as 
you like for colour and taste. When the curd is come, 
break it gently, and put it in with the skimmer, till it is 
pressed two inches above one vat Press it eight or ten 
hours. Salt it, and turn every day. 

Cream Cheese, 

Put five quarts of strippings, that is, the last of the 
milk, into a pan, with two spoonfuls of rennet. When 
the curd is come, strike it down two or three times witk 
the skimming-dish just to break it. Let it ataad two 
hours, then spread a cheese-cloth on a sieve, pot the 
curd on it, and let the whey drain ; break the cord a 
little with your hand, and put it into a vat with a two 
pound weight upon it. Let it stand twelve hours^ takt 
it uut, and bind a fillet round. Turn every, day till dry, 
from one board to another ; cover them iwitfa oettfes, or 
clean dock-leaves, and put between two pewter-phUes 
to ripen. If the weather be warm, it will be ready in 
three weeks. 

Another, — Have ready a kettle of boiling water, P^ 
five quarts of new milk into a. pan, and^ne pinta^pM 
water, ^ndfive of hot ; when of a proper b^it, put in ai 
much rennet as will bring it in twenty minutes, likewise 
a bit of sugar. When come, strike the skimmiBr three 
or four times down, and leave it on the curd. In m 
hour or two lade it into the vat without touchia§it; put 
a two pound weight on it when the whey^hafs ivn kon 
it, and the vat is full. 

Another sort — Put as mvch salt to three pints of i«v 
cream as shall season it: stir it weU, and pour it into t 
sieve in which ydu have folded a cheeschckotk tbitc of 
four times, and laid at the bottom. WheBithaidem 
cover it with nettles on a pewter*platflu 



DAIRY. 265 

Rusk Cream Cheese. 

To a quart of fresh cream put a pint of new milk 
warm enough to make the cream a proper warmth, a bit 
of sugar, and a Httle rennet. 

Set near th<; fire till the curd comes ; fill a vat made 
in the form of a brick, of wheat-straw or rushes sewed 
together. Have ready a square of straw, or rushes 
tewed flat, to rest the vat on, and another to cover it ; 
the vat being open at top and bottom. Next day take it 
out| and change it as above to ripen. A half-pound 
weight wilt be sufficient to put on it. 

AnotJter way. — ^Take a pint of very thick sour cream 
from the top of the pan for gathering butter, lay a nap* 
kin on two plates, and peur half into each, let them 
ttand twelve hours, then put them on a fresh wet napkin 
ip one plate, and cover with the same ; this do every 
twelve hours until you find the cheese begins to look 
dry, then ripen it with nut-leaves ; it will be ready in 
ten days. 

, Fresh nettles, or two pewter-plates, will ripen cream- 
cheese very well. 

Observations respecting Butter, 

There is no one article of family consumption more 
in use, of greater variety in goodness, or that is of more 
consequence to have of a superior quality, than this, and 
the economising of which is more necessary. The sweet- 
ness of butter is not affected by the cream being turned, 
of <vhich it is made. When cows are in turnips, or eat 
cabbages, the taste is very disagreeable ; and the follow- 
ing ways have been tried with advantage to obviate it :— 
• When the milk is strained into the pans, put to every 
six gallons one gallon of boiling water. Or dissolve one 
ounce of nitre in a pint of spring-water, and put a quar- 
ts of a pint to every fifteen gallons of milk. Or, when 
you churn;* Keep biack a quafter of a pint of the sour 
cream, and put it into a well-scalded pot, into which 
y<Ai are to gather the next cream ; stir that well, and do 
so with every fresh addition. 

N 



966 UOMCSTIC COORERT. 

To make Butttrr, 

During summer, skim the milk when the sun ha-^ not 
heated the dairy ; at that season it siiould stand for but- 
ter iwfnty-four hours without skimming, and forty-eigtt 
in winter. Deposit the cream-pot in a very cold cellar, 
if your dairy is not more so. If you cannot chum ^aily, 
change it into scalded fresh pots ; but never omit chunh 
ingt^^ice a week. If possihle, put the churu in a tlio- 1 
rough air; and if not a barrel one, set it in a tub of ! 
water two feet deep, which will give tinnness to the bote ■ 
ttT. When the butler is come, pour off the buttermilk, 
and put the butter into a fresh-scalded pan, or tubs 
which have aftiTwards been in cold water. Pour water 
CM1 it, and let it lie to acquire some hardness before you i 
vork it; tiien change the water, and beat it with flat 
board:} so perfectly that not the least taste of the butter- 
milk remain, and that the water, which must be often 
changed, shall be quite clear in colour. Then work 
sr)me salt into it, weigh, and make it into forms ; throw 
them into cold water, in an earthen pan and cover of the 
<iueen*s ware. You will then have very nice and cool 
butter in the hottesCwe^her. it requires more working 
ill hot than in cold weather ; but in neither should be 
left with a particle of buttermilk, or a sour taste^ as is 
sometimes done. 

To preserve Butter, 

Take two parts of the best common salt, one part 
good loaf-sugar, and one part saltpetre; beat them 
tvcll together. To sixteen ounces ^f butter thoroughly 
cleansed from the milk, put one ounce of this composi- 
tion ; work it well, and pot down, when become firm and 
cold. 

'llie butter thus preserved is the better for keeping, 
and should not be used under a month. This article 
should be kept from the air, and is bes{ in pots of the 
best glazed earthy that will hold from ten to fourteen 
pounds each. 



DAIRY. 207 

To preserve Butter for JVinter, the best way. 

When the butter has been prepared as above directed^ 
take two parts of the best common salt, one part of good 
loaf-sugar, and one part of saltpetre, beaten and blended 
well together. Of this composition put one ounce to 
s^Kteen ounces of butter, and work it well together in a 
mass. Press it into the pans after the butter is become 
cool ; for friction, though it be not touched by the hands, 
will soften it The pans should hold ten or twelve 
Munds each. On the top put some salt ; r d when that 
IS turned to brine, if not enough to cover the butter en- 
tirely, add some strong salt and water. It requires only 
t6en to be covered from the dust 

To manage Cream for ffhey Butter, 

* Set the whey one day and night, skim it, and so till 
jou havdenough; then boil it, and pour it into a pan 
or two of cold water. As the cream rises, skim it till no 
niore comes ; then chum it. Where new-milk cheese 
is made daily, whey-butter for common and present use 
IDay be made to advantage. 

To scald Cream, as in the W^iett of England. 
In winter let the milk stand twepty-four hours, in the 
summer twelve at least; then put the milk-pan on an 
hot hearth, if you have one ; if not, set it in a wide brass 
kettle of water large enough to receive the pan. It must 
remain on the fire till quite hot, but on no account boil, 
or tltoe will be a skin instead of a cream ypon the milk. 
You will know when done enough, by the undulations 
•n the surface looking -thick, and having a ring round 
the pan the size of the bottom. The time required to 
scald cream depends on the size of the pan and the heat 
of the fire; the slower the better. Remove the pan 
into the dairy when done, and skim it next day. In 
cold weather it may stand thirty-six hours, and never less 
than two meals.' 

' The butter is usually made in Devonshire of cream 
thus prepared, and if properly it is v^ry firm.

PC'JLTRY-YARD, 269 

To choos • Butter at Market, 

Put a knife into the butter if salt, and smell it Mrhen 
drawn out ; if there is any thing rancid or unpleasant, it 
is bad. Being made at different times, the layers in 
casks AVill vary greatly, and you will not easily come at 
'the goodness but by unhooping the cask, and trying it 
between the staves. Fresh butler ought to smell like a 
nosegay, and be of an equal colour all through: if sour 
in smell it has not been sutBciently washed ; if veiny and 
open, it is probably mixed with staler or an inferior soit. 

POULTRY-YARD. 

Management ofFoxvls, 

In order to hav* fine fowls, it is necessary to choose a 
good breed, and have proper care taken of them. The 
J^artford sort is thought highly of; and it is desirable tD 
have a €ne large kind, but people differ in their opinion 
of which is best. The black are very juicy ; but do not 
luiswer so well for boiling, as their legs partake of their 
colour. They .should be fed as nearly as possible at the 
same hour and place. Potatoes bpiled, unskiuned, in jsl 
little water, and then cut, and ^Skr wet with skimmed 
miJk'Or not, form one of the best foods. Turkies and 
fowls thrive amazingly on them. The miiik must not be 
sour. 

The best age for setting a hen, is from two to five 
years ; and you should remark which hens make the best 
brooders, and keep those to laying who are giddy and 
careless of their young. In justice to the animal crea- 
tion, however, it must be observed, there are but few 
instances of bad parents for the time their nursing is ne- 
cessary. 

Hens sit twenty days. Convenient places should be 
provided for their laying, as these will be proper for sit- 
ting likewise. If the hen-house is not secured from ver- 
min, the eggs will be sucked, and the fowls destroyed. 

Those hens are usually preferred which have tufts of 
(eatheri on tkeir heads; those that crow are 4)ot looked 

M 3 



270 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

upon as profitable. Some fine young fowls should be 
reared every year, to keep up a stock of good breeders; 
and by this attention, and removing bad layers and care* 
less nurses, you will have a chance of a good stock. 

Let the hens lay some time before you set them, which 
should be done from tlie end of February to the begin- 
ning of May. \A'hile liens are laying, teed them well, 
and sometimes with oats. 

Broods of chickens are hatched alt through the sum* 
mer, but those that come out very late require much 
care till they have gainv.'d some strength. 

if the eggs of any other sort are put under a hen with 
fome of her own> observe to add her own as many days 
alter the others, as there is a difference in the length of 
their sitting. A turkey and duck sit thirty days. Choose 
large clear eggs to put her upon, and such a number as 
she can property cover. If very large eggs, there are 
sometimes two yolks, and of course neither will be pn>> 
ductive. Ten or twelve are quite enough. 

A hen-bouse should be large and high ; and should be 
frequently cleaned out, or the vemun of fowls will in- 
crease greatly. But hens must not be disturbed while 
sitting; for if frightened, they sometimes forsake their 
nests. Wormwood and rue should be planted plentifully 
about their houses : boil some of the former, and sprinkle 
it about the floor ; which should be of smooth earth, not 
paved. The windows of the house should be open to the 
rising sun : and a hole must be left at the door, to let 
the smaller fowls go in ; the larger may be let in and out 
by opening the door. There should be a small sliding 
board to shut down when the fowls are gone. to roost; 
which would prevent the small beasts of prey from com- 
mitting ravages, and a good strong door and lock may 
possibly, in some measure, prevent the depredations of 
human enemies. 

When some of the chickens are hatched long before 
the others, it may be necessary to keep them in a basket 
of wool till the others come forth. The day after they 
are hatched, give ibevii uaivc ci>rBc\^% q\ >«V^v^ b^cead* and

small (or rather cracked) grits soaked in milk. As soon 
as they have gained a little strength, feed them with 
curd, cheese-parings cut small, or any soft food, but 
nothing sour; and give them clean water twice a day. 
Keep the hen under a pen till the young have strength 
to follow her about, which will be in two or three weeks ; 
and be sure to feed her well. 

The food of fowls goes first into their crop, which 
softens it; and then passes into the gizzard, which by 
constant friction macerates it : and this is facilitated by 
fmall stones, which are generally found there^ and which 
help to digest the food. 

If a sitting hen is troubled with vermin, let her be 
veil washed with a decoction of wild lupins. The pip 
in fowls is occasioned by drinking dirty water, or taking 
filthy food. A white thin scale on the tongue, is the 
symptom. Pull the scale off with your nail, and rub 
the tongue with some salt ; and the complaint will be re^ 
moved. 

It answers well to pay some boy employed in the farm 
or stable, so much a score for the eggs he brings in. It 
uill be his interest tlien to save them from bemg pur- 
loined, which nobody but one in his situation can pre* 
vent ; and sixpence or eightpence a score will be buy- 
M^g ^ggs cheap. 

To make Hens lay. 

Dissolve an ounce of Glaubcr'ti salts in a quart of 
water; mix tlie meal of potatoes with a little of the li- 
quor, and feed the hens two days, giving them plenty cf 
clean water to drink. The above quantity is sufHcient 
for sLx or eight hens. They should have plenty of clean 
water in reach. In a few days they will produce eggs. 
To fatten Fowls or Chickens in four or Jive Days, 

Set rice over the fire with skimmed milk, only as 
much as will serve one day. Let it boil till the rice is 
quite swelled out : you may add a tea-spoonful or two 
of sugar, but it will do well without. Feed them three 
limes a day, in common pans, giving them only as much 
as will (|uite fill ihfim at once. When you ^vsi &e&^> Vhx

272 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

Ihe pans be set in water, that no sourness may he cenvey- 
€(] to the fowls, as that prevents them from fattening. 
Give them clean water, or the milk of the rice, to ilrink; 
but the less wet the latter is when perfectly soaked, the 
belter. By this method the flesh will have a clear white- 
ness which no other food gives ; and when it is coDside^ 
ed how far a pound of rice will go, and how much time 
b saved by this mode, it will be found to be as cheap as 
barley-meal, or more so. The pen should be daily 
cleaned, and no food g'ven for sixteen hours before poul- 
try be killed. 

To choose Fg^s at Market, and preserve them. 

Put the large end of the egg to your tongue ; if it feels 
«rarm it is new. In new-laid eggs, there is a small divi- 
lion of the skin firom the shell, which is filled with air, 
and is perceptible to the eye at the end. On looking 
through them against the sun of a candle, if fresh, eggs 
will be pretty clear. If they shake they are nut fresh. 

Eggs may be bought cheapest when the hens first be* 
«n to lay in the spring, before they sit; in Lent and at 
Easter they become dear. They may be preserved fresh 
by dipping them in boiling water and instantly takiji|( 
them out, or by oiling the shell ; either of which ways 
IS to prevent the air passing through it: or kept on 
shelves with small holes to receive one }n each, and be 
turned every other day ; or close-packed in a keg, and 
covered with strong lime-water. 

Feathers. 
In towns, poultry being usually sold ready picked, the 
feathers, which may occasionally come in iu small jquas- 
titles, are neglected ; but orders shoidd be giren to ppt 
them into a tub free from damp, and as they dry to 
change them into paper bags, a few in each ; they should 
hang in a dry kitchen to season ; fresh ones must sot bt 
added to those in part dried, or they will occasion a musl^ 
smell, but they should go through the same process. In 
a few months they will be fit to ^dd to beds, or to make 
pillows, without tKe usu^V mo^^f dc\vu^tkem in aca«l

five or six months. 

Ducks 

Oenetally begin to -ay in the month of February. TTieir 
eggs should be daily taken away except one, till they 
seem inclmed to sit ; then leave them and see that there 
are enough. They require no attention while sitting, 
except to give them foo<l at the time they come out to 
seek it ; and there should be water placed at a moderate 
distance from them, that their eggs may not be spoiled 
by their long absence in seeking it. Twelve or thirteeti 
eggs are enough : in an early season it is best to set theiti 
under a hen ; and then they can be kept from water till 
they have a little strength to bear it, which in very cold 
weather they cannot do so well. They should be put 
under cover, especially in a wet season ; for though wa- 
ter is the natural element of ducks, yet they are apt to be 
killed by tlie cramp before they are covered with feathers 
to defend them. 

Ducks should be accustomed to feed and rest at one. 
place, which would prevent theirstraggling too far to hy^ 
Places near the water to lay iil are advantageous ; and 
these might be small wooden houses, with a partitioa- 
in the middle, and a door at each end. They eat any 
thing ; 9tid when to be fattened, must have plenty, how- 
ever coarse, and in three weeks they will be fat.. 

Geese 

Require little expense; as they chiefly 'support then*- 
selves on commons or in lanes, where they can get water. 
The largest are esteemed best, as also are the white and 
grey. The pied and ddrk*coloured are not so goodi 
Thirty days is generally the time the goose sits,, but m 
warm weather she will sometimes hatch sooner. Give 
them plenty of food, such as scalded bran and light oats ;. 
and as soon as the goslings are hatched, keep- them housed 
for .eight or ten days, and feed them with barley-meal,. 
bran, curds, &c. For greeik geese, be^Vn lo taXXj^tw-X^ne^^.

ble geese require no fattening if they have the run of 
good fields. 

Turkies 
Are 'very tender when youngs As soon as hatched, 
put three pepper- corns down their throat Great care is 
necessary to their well-being, because the hen is so care- 
less that she will walk about with one chick, and leave 
the remainder, or even tread upon and kill them. Tur- 
kies are violent eaters ; and must therefore be left to take 
charge t>f themselves in general, except one good feed a 
day. The hen sits twenty-five or thirty days ; and the 
young ones must be kept warm, as the least cold or damp 
kills them. They must be fed often ; and at a distance 
from the hen, who will eat every thing firom them. They 
should have curds, green-^rheese parings cut small, and 
bread and milk with chopped wormwood in it ; and their 
drink milk and water, but not left to be sour. All young 
fowls are a prey for vermin, therefore they should be 
kept in a safe place where none can come ; weasels, stoats, 
ferrets, &c. creep in at very small crevices. 

Let the hen be under a coop, in a warm place exposed 
to the sun, for the first three or four weeks; and the 
young should not be suffered io go out in the dew at 
morning or evening. Twelve eggs are enough to put 
under a turkey ; and when she is alxtut to lay, lock her 
up till she has laid every morning. . They usually begin 
to lay in March, and sit in April. Feed them near the 
hen-house ; and give them a little meat in the evening, 
to accustom them to roosting there. Fatten thenii with 
sodden oats or barley for the first fortnight ; and the last 
fortnight give them as above, and rice swelled with warm 
milk over the fire, twice a day. The flesh will be beau* 
tifiilly white and fine-fiavoured. The common way is to 
cram them, but they are so ravenous that it seems un- 
pecessary, if they are not suffered to go far from home, 
which makes them poor.

POULTR Y-YAR B. 275 

it is very wrong to pursue them, as many ignorant people 
do, in the idea of bringing them home ; for it only causes 
the hen to carry , the young ones through dangerous 
places, and by hurrying she treads upon them. The 
cock kiHs all the young chickens he can get at, by one 
blow on the centre of the head with his bill ; and he 
does the same by his own brood before the feathers of 
the crown come out. Nature therefore impels the hen 
to keep them out of his way till the feathers rise. 

Guinea Hens 

Lay a great number of eggs ; and if you can discover the 
nest, it is best to put them under common hens, which 
are better nurses. They require g;reat warmth^ quiet, 
and careful feeding with rice swelled with milk, or bread 
soaked in it. Put two pepper-corns down their throat 
when first hatched. 

Pigeons 

Bring two young ones at a time; and breed every 
month, if well looked after, and plentifully fed. They 
should be kept very clean, and the bottom of the dove- 
cote be strewed with saivd once a month at least Tare? 
and white peas are their proper food. They should have 
plenty of ^esh water in their house. Starlings and other 
birds are apt to come among them, aitd suck the eggs. 
Vermin likewise are their great enemies, and destroy 
thera. If the breed should be too small, put a few tame 
pigeons of the common kind, and of their own colour, 
among them. Observe nt>t to have too large a pro^rar- 
tion of cock-birds; for they are quarrelsome, and will 
spon thin the dove-cote. ^ 

Pigeons are fond of salt, and it keeps them in health. 
^ Lay a large heap of clay near the house ; and let the 
falt-brine that may be done with in the family be poured 
upon it 

Bay-salt and cummin-seeds mixed is an universal re- 
medy for the diseases of pigeons. The backs and breasts 
a^ sometimes scabby : in which case, take a quarter o£ 
a pound of bay-salt, and as much commQlai^\.\ ^ ^^^^vl^

of frond-seeds, a pound of diU-aeed, ts nracli cnmmitt- 
seed, and an ounce of assafoetida ; mix all with a little 
vbeaten Hour, and some Ane worked clay ; when all are 
well beaten together, put it into two earthen pots, and 
bake them in the oven. When cold, put them on thi 
table in the dove-cote ; the pigeons will eat it> and thss 
be cured. . 

Rahlnts. 
The wild ones have the finest flavour, unless great care 
is taken to keep the tame delicately clean. The tame 
one brings forth every month, and must be allowed to 
go with the buck as soon as she has kindled. The 
•sweetest hay, oats, beans, sow-thistle, parsley, carrot- 
tops, cabbage-leaves, and bran, fresh and fresh, should 
be given to them. If not very well attended, their 
stench will destroy themselves, and be very unwhole- 
some to all who live near them ; but attention will pre- 
vent this inconvenience.

SICK COOKE&Y. 

General Remarks, 

THE following pages will contain cookery for ^ sick ; 
it being of more consequence to support those whose bad 
appetite will not allow them to take the necess^ noo^ 
rishment, than to stimulate that of persons in health. 

It may not be unnecessary to advise that a choice be ' 
made of the things most likely to aigpf^ with the patient ; 
that a change^ be provided ; that some one at least be 
always ready ; that not too much of those be made at 
once, which are not likely to keep, as invalids rec^irt 
-variety ; and that they should succeed each other in dif* 
Ar€»t Ibrms aod flavoui:a.

^ clear Broth that will keep long. 
Put the mouse round of beef, a knuckle bone of veal, 
«tul a few shanks of mutton, inta a deep ^^an, and cover 
dose v^ith a dish or coarse crust ; bake <.ill the beef is 
done enough for eating, with only as much water as will 
cover. When cold, cover it close in a cool place. Whe* 
to be used, give what flavour may be approved. 

j4 quick made Broth, 
Take a bone or two of a neck or loin of mutton, take 
off the fat and skin, set it on the Are in a small tin sauce- 
pan that has a cover, with three quarters of a pint of 
water, the meat being first beaten, and cut in thin bits ; 
put a bit of thyme and parsley, and, if approved, a slice 
of onion. Let it boil very quick, skim it nicely ; take 
off the cover, if likely to be too weak ; else cover it» 
Half an hour is sufficient for the whole process. 

A very supporting Broth against any kind of weakness^ 

Boil two pounds of loin of mutton, with a very large 
handful of chervil, in two quarts of water, to one. Take 
off part of the fat. Any other herb or roots may be 
added. Take half a pint three or four times a day. 

A very nourishing Feal Broth. 
Put the knuckle of a leg or shoulder of veal, with very 
little meat to it, an old fowl, and four shank-bones of 
mutton extremely well soaked and bruised, three blades 
of mace, ten pepper-corns, an onion, and a large bit of 
bread, and three quarts of water, into a stew-pot that 
covers close, and simmer in the slowest manner after it 
has boiled up, and been skimmed ; or bake it ; strain, 
and take off the fat. Salt as wanted. It will require 
four hours. 

Broth of Beef, Mutton, and Teai, 
Put two pounds of lean beef, one pound of scrag of 
veal, one pound of scrag of mutton, sweet herbs, and ten 
pepper-corns, into a nice tin sauce-pan, with five quarts 
of water : shnmer to three quarts ; and clear fkoiA the

Soap and broth made of different meats, are more 
•upporting, as welt as better flavoured. 

To remove the fat, take it o(f when cold as clean as 
possible ; and if there be still any remaining, lay a bit of 
clean blotting or cap paper on the broth when in the 
basin, and it will take up every particle. 

CaJtoes^ feet Broth, 

Boil two feet in three quarts of water to half; strain 
and set it by ; when to be used, take oif the fat, put a 
large tea-cupful of the jelly into a sauce-pan, with half a 
glass of sweet wine, a little sugar and nutmeg, and beat 
it up till it be ready to boil, then take a little of it, aod 
beat by degrees to the yolk of an egg, and addinjg a bit 
of butter, the size of a nutmeg, stir it all together, but 
doiiH let it boil. Grate a bit of fresh lemon-peel into it 

Another, — Boil two calves' feet, two ounces of veal, 
and two of beef, the bottom of a penny-loaf, two or three 
blades of mace, half a nutiueg sliced, and a little salt, ip 
three (|uarts of water, to three pints ; strain, and take off 
the fat. 

Chicken Broth, 
Put the body and legs of the fowl that chicken-panada 
was mack; of, as in page 280| after taking off the skin and 
rump, into the water it was boiled in, with one blade of 
mace, one slice of onion, and ten white pepper-coros. 
Simmer till the broth be of a pleasant flavour. If not 
water enough, add a little. Beat a quarter of an ounce 
of sweet almonds with a tea-spoonful of water, fine,, boil 
it in the broth> strain, and, when cold, remove the fat 

Eel Broth. 

Clean half a pound of small eels, and set them on with 
three pints of water, some parsley, one slice of onion, a 
few pepper-corns; let them simmer till the eels are broken, 
and the broth good. Add salt, and strain it off. 

The above should make three half-pints of broth.

a quart of water twenty minutes, after it has once boiled, 
and been skimmed. Season, if approved ;, but it has 
generally only salt 

Dr. RatdiJPs restorative Pork-jelly. 

Take a leg of well-fed pork, just as cut up, beat it, 
and break the bone. Set it over a gentle fire, with three 
gallons of water, and simmer to one. Let half an ounce 
oi mace, and the same of nutmegs, stew in it. Strain 
through a fine sieve. When cold, take olf the fal. Give 
a chocolate cup the first and last thing, and at noon^

Slmnh Jelly. 

Soak twelve shanks of mutton four hours, then brush 
and scour them very clean. Lay them in a sauce-pan 
with three blades of mace, an onion, twenty' Jamaica^ 
and thirty or forty black peppers, a bunch of sweet 
herbs, and a crust of bread made very brown by toasting. 
Pour three quarts of water to them, and set them on a 
hot hearth close-coveretl ; let them simmer as' gently as 
possible for five hours, then strain it off, and put it in a 
cold place. 

This may have the addition of ^ pound of beef, if ap- 
proved, for flavour. It is a remarkably good thing for 
people who are weak. 

Arrow-root Jelly. 

Of this beware of having the wrong sort, for it has been 
counterfeited witli bad effect. If genuine, it is very 
nourishing, especially for weak bowels. Put into a sauce- 
pan half a pint of water, a glass of sherry or a spoonful 
of brandy, grated nutmeg, and fine sugar ; boil once up, 
then mix it by degrees into a desert-spoonful of arrow- 
root, previously rubbed smooth, with two spoonfuls of 
cold water ; then return the whole into the sauce-pan ; 
stir and boil it three minutes.

with real Lisbon sugar of a good quality. 

Chocolate, 

Tliose who use much of this article, will find the fol- 
lowing mode of preparing it both useful and econo- 
iiiical : 

Cut a cake of chocolate in very small bits ; put a pint 
of water into the pot, and, when it boils, put in the 
above; mitl it oil* the fire until quite melted, then on a 
gnitle fire till it boil ; pour it into a basin, and it will, 
keep in a cool place eight or ten days, or more. Wbca 
want(d, put a spoonful or two into milk, boil it with 
sugar, and mill it well. 

This, if not made thick, is a very good breakfast or 
supper.

Saloop. 
Boil a little water, wine, lemon-peel, and sugar^ t»> 
gether: then mix with a small quantity of the powder, 
previously rubbed smooth, with a little cold water ; stir 
it all together, and boil it a few ininutes. 

Milk Porridge. 
Make a fine grutl of half-grits, long boiled ; strain <jffi 
either add cold milk, or warm with milk, as may be 
approved. Serve with toast. 

French Milk Porridge. 

Stir some oatmeal and water togethier, let it stand to 
be clear, and pour oft" the latter ; pour fresh upon it, stir 
it well, let it stand till next day; strain through a fine 
sieve, and boil the water, adding milk while doing. The 
proportion of water must be small. 

This is nuich ordered, with toast for the breakfast of

mon, lemon-peel, and nutmeg. Sweeten when nearly 
done. 

Sago. 
To prevent the earthy taste, soak it in cold water an 
hour ; pour that off, and wash it well ; then add more, 
and simmer gently till the berries are clear, with lemon- 
peel and spice, if approved. Add wine and sugar, and 
boil all up together. 

Sago Milk, 
Cleanse as above, and boil it slowly and wholly with 
new milk. It swells so much, that a small quantity 
will ,be sufficient for a quart, and when done it will be 
dtminished to about a pint. It requires no sugar or flat 
▼jouring. 

Asses* Milk 
Far surpasses any imitation of it that can be made. It 
should be milked into a glass that is kept warm by being 
in a basin of hot water. 

The fixed air that it contains gives some people a pain 
in the stomach. At first a tea-spoonful of rum may be 
taken with it, but should only be put in the moment it. 
is toi be swallowed. 

Artificial Asses* Milk. 
Boil together a quart of water, a quart of new milk, an 
oiince of white sugar-candy, half an ounce of eringo- 
root, and half an ounce of conserve of roses, till half be 
wasted. 

This is astringent ; therefore proportion the doses to 
the effect, and the quantity to what will be used while 
sweet. 

Another.'— 'MiK two spoonfuls of boiling water, two of 
milk, and an egg well beaten; sweeten with pounded' 
white sugar-candy. This may be taken twice or thrice a 
day. 

Another. — Boil two ounces of hartshorn-shavings, two 
ounces of pearl-barley, two* ounces of candied eringo-* 
root, and one dozen of snails that have been bruised,, in 
two quarts of water, to one. Mix with an equal quantity 
of new milk, when taken^ twice a dey.

Water Gruel 

Put a large spoonful of oatmeal by degrees intoa^piut .; 
of water, and when smooth boil it. 

Another vsay, — Rub smooth a large spoonful of oat* 
meal, with two of water, and pour it into a pint of ti^ater 
boiling on tlie fire ; stir it well, and boil it quick ; but 
take care it does not boil over. In a quarter of an hour 
strain it off; and add salt and a bit of butter when eaten. 
Stir until the butter be incorporated. 

Barley GrueL 
Wash four ounces of pearl-barley, boil it In two quarts 
of water and a stick of cinnamon, till reduced to a quart; 
strain and return it into the sauce-pan with sugar, and 
three-quarters of a pint of port-wine. Heat up, and use 
as wanted. 

A very agreeable Drink. 

Into a tumbler of fresh cold water, pour a table spoon- 
ful of capillaire, and the same of good vinegar. 

Tamarinds, currants fresh or in jelly, or scalded cor* 
rants or cranberries, make excellent drinks ; with a little 
sugar, or not, as may be agreeable. 

j4 refreshing Drink in a Fever, 
Put a little tea-sage, two sprigs of balm, and a little 
wood-sorrei, into a stone jug, having £rst washed and 
dried them ; peel thin a sxnall lemon, and clear from the 
white ; slice it, and put a bit of the peel in, then pour 
in three pints of boiling water, sweeten, and cover it , 
close. j 

Anotlter Drinlc^^Waish extremely well an ounce of i 
pearl-barley ; shift it twice, then put to it three pinis.of 
^ater, an ounce of sweet almonds beaten fine, .and a bit 
of lemon-peel ; boil till you have a smooth liquor, tbea 
put in a little syrup of lemons and capillaire. 
. Another, — Boil three pints of water with an ounce and 
a half of tamarinds, three obnces of currants, and two 
ounces of stoned raisins, till near a third be consumed. 
Strain it on a bit of lemon-peel, which remove in an boo^ 'i 
as it gives a bitter taste if left long.

A most pleasant Drink, 
Put a tca-cupfui of cranberries into a cup of water, and 
masii them. In the mean time boil two quarts of water 
with one large spoonful of oajtmeal and a bit of lemoo- 
peel; then add the cranberries, and as much fine lis* 
bon sugar as shall leave a smart flavour of the fruit ; and 
a quarter of a pint of sherry, or less, as may be proper ; 
boil all for half an hour, and strain off. 

^1^ and fine Draught for those who are weak and have a 

Cough. 
■ Beat a fresh laid egg, and mix it with a quarter of a 
pint of new milk warmed, a large spoonful of capillaire, 
fte same of rose-water, and a little nutmeg scraped. 
Dent warm it after the egg is put in. Take it the first 
and last thing. 

Toast and Heater, 
Toast slowly a thin piece of bread till extremely brown 
and hard, but not the least black ; then plunge it into a 
j«ig of cold water, and cover it over an hour before used. 
This is of particular use in weak bowels. It should be 
of[a fine brown colour before drinking it 

Barley footer. 

Wash a handful of common barley, then simmer it 
gently in thrte pints of water with a bit of lemon-peel. 
^ Ttius is less apt to nauseate than pearl-barley ; but the 
dtlier IB a very pleasant'drink. 

Another wa^.— rBoil an ounce of pearl-barley a few 
minutes to cleanse, then put on it a quart of water, siin« 
lifier an hour ; vfhen half done, put into it a bit of fresh 
leihon-peel, and one bit of sugar. If likely to be toe 
thick, you may put another quarter of a pint of water. 
Lemon-juice may be added if chosen. 

Lemon-water, a deligh^l Drink. 

Put two slices of lemon thinly pared into a tea-pot, a 
little bit of the peel, and a bit of sugar, or a large spoon* 
ful of capillaire; pour in a pint of boiling water, and^c^ 
k close two hours.

(See page 230.) This is one of the most delightful 
drinks that can be made.

That of cheese is a very wholesome drink, especially 
when the cows are in fresh herbage. 

irhiU'Wine Whey. 
Put half a pint of new milk on the fire ; the momeot 
it boils upi pour in as much sound rais'm wine as will con- 
pletoly turn it, and it looks clear; let it boil up, theirwt 
the sauce-pau aside till the curd subsides, and do not stir 
it. Pour the whey off, and add to it half a pint of boiling 
water, and a bit of white sugar, ^hus you will- have a

vou choose to make it. 

Vinegar and Lemon Wheys. 
Pour into boiling milk as much vinegar or lenvm- 
juice as will make a small quantity quite clear, dilute 
with iiot water to an agreeable smart acid, and put a bit 
or two of sugar. This is less heating than if made of 
wine; and if only to excite perspiration, answers as 
well 

Buttermilk, with Bread or vdihouL 

It is most wholesome w hen sour, as being less likely 
to be heavy; but most agreeable when made of sweet 
cream. 

Dr. Boerhaave's sxveet Buttemtilk. 

Take the milk from the cow into a small chum, of 
about six shillings price ; in about ten minutes begin 
churning, and continue till tb(» flakes of butter swim about 
pretty thick, and the milk is discharged of all the greasy 
particles, and appears thin and blue. Strain it througti a 
sieve, and drink it as frequently as possible.

It should form the m hole of the patient's drink, and the 
food should be biscuits and rusks, in every way and 
sort ; ripe and dried fruits of various kinds, when a de> 
dine is apprehended. 

Baked and dried fruits, raisins in particular, make 
excellent suppers for invalids, with biscuits, or common 
cake. 

Orgeat 

Beat two ounces of almonds with a tea-spoonful of 
orange-Bower water, and a bitter almond or two; then 
pour a quart of milk and watesto the paste. Sweeten 
with sugar, or capillaire. This is a.finc drink for those 
who have a tender chest ; and in the gout it is higlily 
useful, and, with the addition of half an ounce of gum 
arable, has been found to allay the painfulness of the at- 
tendant heat. Half a glass j©f brandy may be added if 
thought too cooling in the latter complaints, and the glass 
of orgeat may be put into a basin of warm water. 
' Another orgeat, for company, is in page 229. 

Orangeade, or Lemonade, 

Squeeze the juice ; pour boiling water on a little of 
the peel, and cover close. " Boil water and sugar to a 
thin syrup, and skim it. When all are cold, mix the 
juice, the infusion, and the syrup, with as much more 
water as will make a rich sherlnrt ; strain through a jelly- 
bag. Or squeeze the juice, and strain it, and add water 
and capillaire. 

Fgg IVine, 

Beat an egg, mix With it a spoonful of cold water ; set 
on the fire a glass of white wine, half a glass of water, 
sugar j and nutmeg. When it boils, pour, a little of it 
to the egg by degrees, till the whole be in, stirring it 
well ; then return the whole into the sauce-pan, put it on 
« gentle fire, stir if one way fop not more than a minute; 
for if it boil, or the egg be stale, it w.ll curdle. Serve 
jwtth toast. 

Egg wine may be made as above, without warming 
the egg, and it is then lighter on the stomach, though not 
so pleasant to the taste.

COOKERY FOR THE POOR. 

Grncral Remarks and Hints. 

I promised a few hints, to enable every family to aaSibt 
thf poor of their neighbourhood at a very trivial expense; 
and these may be varied or amended at the discretioa 
of the mistress. 

Whore cows are kept, a jug of skimmed milk is a va- 
lualile present, and a very common one. ^ 

When the oven is hot, a large pudding may be baked, 
and given to a sick or young family; and thus made, 
the trouble is little: — Into a deep coarse pan put half a 
pound of rice, four ounces of coarse sugar or treacle, 
two quarts of milk, and two ounces of dripping ; set it 
cold into the oven. It will take a good while, but be an 
excellent solid food. 

A very good meal may be bestowed in a thing called 
brew is, which is thus made:— Cut a very thick upper 
crust of bread, and put it into the pot where salt b^f is 
boiling and near ready ; it will attract some of the fat, 
and, when swelled out, will be no unpalatable dish to 
those who rarely taste meat 

J baked Soup. 

Put a pound of any kind of meat cut in slices ; twQ 
onions, two carrots, ditto ; two ounces 'of rice, a pint 
of split peas, or whole ones if previously soaked, pepper 
and salt, into an earthen jug or pan, and |KHir one gal- 
lon of water. Cover it very close, and bake it with the 
bnad. 

The cook should be chargetl to save the boiling of 
every piece of meat, ham, tongue, &c. however salt: 
as it is easy to use only a part of that, and the rest of 
fresh water, and, by the addition of more vegetables,' the 
bones of the meat used in the femily, the pieces of meat 
that come from table on the plates, and rice, Scotch 
barley, or oatmeal, "there will be some gallons of nu- 
tritious soup two or three times a week. The bits of 
meat should be* only warmed in the soup, and remaii 
whole; the bones, &c. boiled till they yield their nou- 



COOKERY FOR THE m)OR. 201 

rishment. If the things are ready to put in the boiler as 
.soon as the meat is Served, it will save lighting lire, aad 
second cooking. 

Take turnips, carrots, leeks, potatoes, the outer leaves 
of lettuce, celery, or any sort of vegetable that is at hand; 
cut them small, and throw in with the thick part of peas^ 
«fL«r they have been pulped for soup, and grits, or cotrse 
oatmeal, which have been used for gruel. 

Should the soup be poor of meat, the long boiling o£ 
the bones, and different vegetables, will atford better 
Bourishment than the laborious poor can obtain ; espe- 
cially as they are rarely tolerable cooks, and have not 
fiiel to do j iistice to what they buy. But in every family 
there is some superfluity ; and if it be prepared with 
cleanliness and care, the benefit will be very great to the 
receiver, and the satisfaction no !ess to the giver. 

I found, in the time of scarcity, ten or fifteen gallons 
of soup could be dealt out weekly, at an expense not 
worth mentioning, though the vegetables were bought. 
If iu the villages about London, abounding with opulent 
£unilies, the quantity of ten gallons were made in ten 
gentlemen's houses, there would be a hundred gallons of 
wholesome agreeable food given weekly for the supply of 
forty poor families, at the rate of two gallons and a half 
each. 

What a relief to the labourmg husband, instead of 
bread and cheese, to have a warm comfortable'" meal !' 
To the sick, aged, and infant branches, how important a& 
advantage ! nor less to the industrious mother, whose 
forbearance from the necessary quantity of food, that 
others may have a larger share, frequently reduces that 
strength upon which the welfare of her family essentially 
depends. 

It very rarely happens that servants object to second- 
ing the kindness of their superiors to the poor; but 
should tlie cook in any family tliink the adoption of this 
plan too troublesome, a gratuity at the end of the winter 
might re-pay her, if tho love of her fellow-creatures failed 
of doing it a hundred ibid. Did slie readily enter into

it, the w«u1d never wash away, as useless, the (>eas or 
grits of which soup or gruel had been made ; broken po- 
tatoes, the green heads of celery, the necks aod feet of 
fowls, and particularly the shanks of malton, and Tarioiis 
other articles which in preparing dinner for the family 
are thrown aside. 

Fish affords gre^ nourishment, and tbaf not by the 
part eaten only, but the bones, heads, and fins, which 
rontain an isinglass. When the fish is senred, let the 
cook put by some of the water, and stew in it the above; 
as likeu'ise add the gravy that is in the diah, untS she 
obtain all the goodness. If to be eaten by itself* when it 
makes a delightful broth, she should add a very small 
bit "Of onion, some pepper, and a little nce-flour rubbed 
down smooth with it 

But strained, it makes a delicions hnprovement to the 
meat-soup, particularly for the sick ; and when such are 
to be supplied, the milder parts of the spare bones an4 
meat should be used for them, with little^ if any, of the 
liquor of the salt meats. 

The fat should not be taken off the broth or soup, as 
the poor like it, and are nourished by it 

jin excellent Soup for the weakly. 

Put two cow-heels, and a breast of mutton into a large 
pan, with four ounces of rice, one onion, twenty Ja- 
maica peppers, and twenty black, a turnip, a carrot, and 
four gallons of water ; cover with brown paper, and 
bake six hours. 

Sago, 

Put a tea-cupful of sago into a quart of water, and a 
bit of lemon peel \, when thickened, grate some ginger, 
and add half a pint of raisin wine, brown sugar, and two 
spoonfuls of Geneva; boil all up together. 

It is a most supporting thing for those whom disease 
has left very feeble. 

Caudle for the Sick and Lying-in. 

Set three quarts of water on the fire ; mix smooth as 
much oatmeal as will thicken the whole, with a pint of 



VARIOUS RECEll^TS. 293 

^old water : when boiling, pour the latter in, and twenty 
Jamaica peppers in fine powder; boil to a good uiiddliag 
thickness ; then add sugar, half a pint of well-fermented 
table-beer, and a glass of gin. Boil all. 

This mess twice, and once or twice of broth, will be 
of incalcu)al>le service. 

There is not a better occasion for charitable commiser- 
atioQ than when a person is sick. A bit of meat or 
podding sent unexpectedly has often been the means of 
recalling long- lost appetite. 

Nor are the mdigent alone the grateful receivers ; for 
iih the highest houses a real good sick-cook is rarely met 
with; and many who possess all the goods of.fortune* 
kave attributed the first return of health to an appetite 
excited by good kitchen-phfsic, as it is called.

VARIOUS RECEIPTS. 

To make sqft Pomatum. 

BEAT half a pound of unsalted fresh lard in common 
water ; then soak and beat it in two rose-waters, drain it, 
and beat it with two spoonfuls of brandy ; let it drain 
from this ; add to it some essence of lemon, and keep it 
in small pots. 

Another way. — Soak half a pound of clear beef-mar- 
tow, and a pound of unsalted fresh lard, in' water two 
or three days, changing and beating it every day. Put 
it into a sieve; and when dry, into a jar, and the jar 
into a sauce-pan of water. When melted, pour it into a 
basin, and beat it with two spoonfub of brandy : drain 
off the brandy, and then add essence of lemon, bergamot» 
or any other scent that is liked.

Hard Pomatum. 

?r<*pare equal quantities of beef-marrow and mutton- 
?nrt as beft)re, using the brandy to preserve it, and 
ail<!in^ the scent ; then pour it into moulds, or, if you 
have none, into phials of the size you choose the rolls to 
be of. When cold, break the bottles, clear away the 
glass carefully, and put paper round the rolls. 

Potnade Divine. 

Clear a pound and a half of beef-marrow from tbe 
strings and bone, put it into an earthen pan, or vessel ol* 
water fresh from the spring, and change the water night 
and morning for ten days ; tiien steep it in rose-water 
twenly-tour hours; and drain it in a cloth till quite drj. 
lake an ounce of each of the following articles, namelji 
storax, gum-benjamin, odoriferous cypress-powder, or 
of Florence ; half an ounce of cinnamon, two drams of 
cloves, and two drams of nutmeg, all finely powdered; 
mix them with the marrow above prepared ; then put A\ 
the ingredients iuto a pewter pot, that holds tbree pints; 
make a paste of white of egg and flour, and lay it upon 
a piece of rag. Over that must be another piece of 
linen to cover the top of the pot very close, that none of 
the steam may evaporate. Put the pot into a large cop- 
per pot, with water, observing to keep it steady, that it 
may not reach to the covering of the pot that holds the 
marrow. As the water shrinks, add more, boiling hot; 
for it must boil four hours without ceasing a moment 
Strain the ointment through a linen cloth iuto small pots, 
and, when cold, cover them. Don't touch it with any 
thing but silver. It will keep many years. 

A fine pomatum may be made by putting half a pound 
of fresh marrow, prepared as above, and two ounces of 
hog's-lard, on the ingredients; and then observing the 
same process as above. 

Pot Pourri. 
Put into a large China jar the following ingredients in 
layers, with bay-salt strewed between the layers, two 
pecks of damask roses, ptvrt. \\3l \iw^% a\\\\ ^^ blown ;

Slack Pqperfor drmving Patterns. 

Mix and smooth lamp-black and sweet oil ; with a bit 
of flannel, cover a sheet or two of large writing paper 
with this mixture ; then dab the paper dry with a bit* of 
fine linen, and keep it by for using in the following maa- 
ner: 

Put the black side on another sheet of paper, and 
fasten the corners together with a small pin. Lky on the 
back of the black paper the pattern to be drawn, and go 
over it with the point of a steel pencil : the black paper 
will then leave the impression of the pattern on the under 
sheet, on which you must ipw draw it with ink. 

If you draw patterns on cloth, or muslin, do it with a 
pen dipped in a bif of stope blue^ a bit of sugar^ and a 
little water mixed smooth in a tea^cdp, in which it will 
l>e always ready for use ; if fresh, wet to a due consist- 
ence as wanted. ^ 

Black Ink, 

Take a gallon of rain or soit water, and three quarters 
of a pound of blue galls bruised ; infuse them three 
weeks, stirring daily. Then add four ounces of green 
copperas, four ounces of logwood-chips, six ounces of 
gum arable, and a wine-glassful of brandy. 

Another way, — ^The ink-powder sold in Shoe- lane is 
one of the best preparations in this useful article. Direc-

Then pour it into an earthen pan ; and set it by for a day 
or two, till the colour is seltfed. Pour off the water, 
and mix the colour with whitewasher's size. Wash the 
walls three or four times, according as is necessary. 

Yellow. — Dissolve in soft water over the fire equal 
quantities separately of lynber, bright okcr, and blue 
black. Then put it into as much whitewash as you think 
«ufHcient for the work, some of each, and stir it all to- 
gether. If either cast predominates, add more of the 
others till you have the proper tint 

The most beautiful whitewash is made by mixing the 
lime and size with skimmed milk instead of ivater. 

Roman Cement or Mortar, for outside plaistertng or 

brickwork. 

This will resist all weather ; and may be used to 
great advantage to line reai^oirs, as no water can pene- 
trate it 

Take eighty-four pounds of drift-sand, twelve pounds 
of unsiacked lime, and four pounds of the poorest cheese - 
grated through an iron grater. When well mixed, add 
enough hot (but not boiling) water to male into a pro- 
per consistence for plaistering, such a quantity of the 
above as is wanted. It requires very good and quick work- 
ing. One hod of this mortar will go a great way, as it is 
to be laid on in a thin smooth coat, without the least 
space being left uncovered. The wall or lath-wdrk

any other of this country. 

. To take Stains of any kind out of Linen. 

Stains caused by Acids, — ^Wet the part and lay on it 
some salt of wormwood. Then rub it without diluting it 
with more water. 

jinother. — Let t|ie cloth imbibe a little water without 
dipping, and hold the part over a lighted match at a due . 
distance. The spots will be removed by the sulphure- 
ous gas. 

Another way, — ^Tie up in the stained part some pearl- 
ash ; tbeb scrape some soap into cold soft water to make 
a lather, and boil the linen till the stain disappears* 

Stains of Wine, Fruit, Sfc, after they have been long im 
the Linen* — Hub the part on each side with yellow soap. 
Then lay on a mixture of starch in cold water very thick ; 
rub it well in, and expose the linen to the sun and air 
till the stain comes out. If not remaved in three or four 
days, rub that^oif, and renew the process. When dry ifc 
may be sprinkled with a little water. 

Many other Stains may be taken out by dipping t)ie 
linen in sour butter-milk, and drymg in a hot 8un» 
Then wash it in cold water, and dry it, two or thsee 
times a day. 

IroiMHQulds should be wetted; then laid on a hoi 
water-plate, and a little essential salt of lemans put o» 
the part. If the linen becomes dry, wet it and renew 
the process ; observing that the plate is kept boiling hot;. 
Much of the powder sold under the name of s^lt of le» 
Bions is a spurious preparation ; and therefore it b ne- 
cessary to dip the linen in a good deal of water, and wash 
k as soon a:S the stain is removed, to pre vent the. part fron 
being worn into holes by the acidv. 

To take out Mildew, — Mix soft soap with starch pow- 
dered, half as much salt, and the juice of a lemon ; lajc 
k on the part on both sides with a painter's brush. Let

To preserve Furs and Woollen from Moths, 
liet the former be occasionally combed while in use, 
and tlie latter be brushed and shaken. When not waul- 
ed, dry them first,* let them be cool, then mix among 
them bitter apples firom the apothecary's, in small mus-

turned in at the edges, and keep from damp. 

To dye the linings of Furniture, SfC, 

Buff or Salmon-Colour, according to the depth of the 
hue,'— Hub down on a pewter plate twopenny-worth of 
Spanish arnatto, and then boil it in a pail of water a quar- 
ter of an hour. Put into it two ounces of pot^ash, stir it 
round, and instantly put in the lining ; stir it about all 
the time it is boiling, which must be fire or six minutes; 
then put it into cold pump water, and hang the articles 
up singly without wringing. W ben almost dry, fold and 
mangle it. 

Pink. — The calico must be washe<l exfremely clrau

and four ounces of alum ; take it out, and dry in tlie air. 
In the mean time boil in the alum-water two hasdfuls of 
wheat-bran till quite slippery, and then strain it. Take 
two scruples of cochineal, and two ounces of argall finelv 
j>ounded and sifted ; mix with it the hquor by little at a

it is almost wasted, moving it about. Take ont the ca- 
lico, and wash it in chamberlye first, and in cold water 
after; then rinse it in water-starch strained, and drv it 
quick without hanging it in folds. Mangle it very high-

it stand to be cold, after straining. Let the gloves he 
nicely mended ; then with a brush do over tliem, and 
when dry repeat it. Twice is gufficient, unless the co- 
lour is to^ be very dark. When dry, rub off the loose 
dye with a coarse cloth. Beat up the white of an egg, 
and with a spiinge rub it over the leather. The dye will 
stain the hands, but wetting them with vinegar will take 
it off, before they are washed.

with a large brush, and when dry rub it till bright 

To give a fine Colour to Mahogany, 

Let the tables be washed perfectly clean with vinegar, 
having iirst taken out any ink stains there may be with 
spirit of salt ; but it must be used with the greatest care, 
and only touch the part affected, and be instantly washed 
off. Use the following liquid; — Into a pint of cdd- 
drawn linseed oil, put four pennyworth of alkanct-rtot, 
and twopenny worth of rose-pink, in an earthen vessel; 
let it remain all night, then stirring well, rub some of it 
all over the tables with a linen rag ; when it has lain some 
time, rub it bright with linen cloths. 

Eating-tables should be covered with mat, oil-cloth, 
or baize, to prevent staining, and be instantly rubbed 
when tlie dishes are taken off, while still warm. 

To take Ink out of Mahogany . 
Dilute half a tea-spoonful of oil of vitriol with a large 
spoonful of water, and touch the part with a feather; 
watch it, for if it stays too long it will leave a white mark. 
It is therefore belter to rub it quick, and repeat If not 
quite removed. 

Floor-cloths 
Should be chosen that are painted on a fine cloth, that is 
well covered with the colour, and the flowers on which 
do not rise much above the ground, as they wear out 
fipst. llie duriibility of the cloth will depend much on 
these two particulars, but more especially on the time it 
has been painted, and the goodness of the colours. If 
they have not been allowed sufficient space for becoming 
tborottghly hardened, a very little use will injure thero;^ 
and as they are very expensive articles, care in preserv- 
ing them is necessary. It answers to keep them some 
tinie before they are used, either hung up in a dry bam

BI&SCTIONS TO SERVANTS. 305 

When taken 'up for the winter, they should be rolled 
romid a carpet roller, and observe not to crack the paiut 
by turning the edges in too suddenly. 

Old carpets andwer extremely well, painted and sea- 
soned some months before laid down. If for passages^ 
the width must be directed when they are sent to iht 
manufactory, as they are cut before painting. 

To clean Floor-cloths, 

Sweep, tlien wipe them with a ilannel ; and when all 
dust and spots are removed, rub with a waxed fiannel, 
aad then with a dry plain one ; but uae little wax, and 
rtilb ^only enough with the latter to give a little smooth- 
siess^ or it may endanger falling. 

Washing now and then with milk after the above 
sweeping, and drv-rubbing them, give as beautiful alook, 
and they are less slippery. 

To dust Cavpets and Floors, 

Sprinkle tea-leaves ou them, then sweep carefully. 

The fomrier should not be swept frequently with a whisk 
brush, as it wears them fast ; only once a week, and the 
other times with the leaves and a hair brush. 

Fine carpets should be gently done wjth a hair hand- 
brush, such as for cloths, on the knees. 

To clean Carpets, 

Take up the carpet, let it be well beaten, then laid 
down, and brushed on both sides with a hand-brush; 
turn it the right side upwards, and scour it with ox-gall, 
aiul soap and water, very clean, and dry it with liuea 
clotlis. I'hen lay it on grass, or hang it up to dry. 
To gite to Boards a beaut^ul appearance. 

After washing them very nicely clean with soda and 
warm water, and a brush, wash them with a very large 
sponge and clean water. Both times, observe to leave 
DO spot untouched ; and clean straight.up and dowli, not 
crossing from board to board: then dry with clean cloths, 
rubbing hard up and down in the same way. 

The floors should not be often wetted, but very tho- 
jroughly when done; and otice a week dry-rubbed with 
hot sand, and a heavy brush, the rl|^hiv!^^^ oi VVk^>c^Q%^^^ 



306 DOMESTIC COOKERY. 

The side^ of stairs or passages on wliichare carpets, or 
floor-cloth, shutild he washed with sponge instead of 
linen or flaDiiei, and tlie edges will not be soiled. Dif- 
ferent 5]>ongcs should be kept for the two above uses ; 
and those and the brushes should be well washed when 
done with, and kept in dry places. 

To extract Oil from Boards or Stone. 

Make a strong lye of pearl-ashes and soft water ; and 
add as niiich unslacked lime as it will take up; stir it to- 
gether, and then let it settle a few minutes; bottle it; 
and stop close ; have ready some water to lower it as 
used, and scour the part with it. If the liquor should lift 
long on the boards, it will draw out the colour of them ; 
therefore do it with care and expedition. 

To clean stone Stair$ and Halls. 

Boil a pound of pipe-makers* clay with a quart of va* 
ter, a quart of small beer, and put in a bit of stone-blue. 
Wash with this mixture, and when dry, rub the stones 
with flannel and a brush. 

To blacken the fronts of Stone Chimney-pieces. 

Mix oil-varnish with lamp-black, and a little spirit of 
turpentine to thin it to the consistence of paint. Wash 
the stone with soap and water very clean ; then sponge it 
with clear water; and when perfectly dry, btiish' it over 
twice with this colour, letting it dry between the times. 
It looks extremely well. The lamp-black must be sifted 
first. 

To take Stains out of Marble. 

Mix unslacked lime, in finest powder, with the stronger 
soap-lye, pretty thick; and instantly, with a painter*s 
brush, lay it on the whole of the marble, in two montlis 
time wash it oif perfectly clean ; then have ready a fine 
thick lather of soft soap, boiled in soft water ; di{^ a bru^k 
in it, and scour the marble with powder, not as common 
cleaning. This will, by very good rubbing, gfive a beau- 
tiful polish. Clear ofif the soap, and fin'^h with a smooth 
hard brush till the end be effected.

juice being mixed in a bottle, shake it well ; wet the 
spots, and in a few minutes rub with soft linen till they 
clisappear. 

To preserve Irons from Rust. 

Melt fresh mutton-suet ^ smear over the iron with it 
while hot; then dust it well with unslacked lime pound- 
ed, and tied up in a muslm. Irons so prepared will keep 
many moi^hs. Use no oil for them at any time, except 
salad oil ; there beiijg water in all other. 

Fire-irons should be kept wrapt in baize, in a dry 
place^ when not used. 

• jinothei* vmy. — Beat into three pounds of unsalted hogs* 
lard« two di^ams of camphor sliced thin, till it is dissolv- 
ed ; then take as much black lead as will make it of the 
colour of broken steel. Dip a rag into it, and rub it 
thick on the stove, &c. and the steel will never rust, 
even if wet. When it is to be used, the grease must be 
washed o£f with hot water, and the steel be dried before 
poll&bing. 

To take Rust out qf Steel 

Cover the steel with sweet oil well rubbed on it, and 
in forty-eight hours use unslacked lime finely powdered^ 
and rub until all the rust disappears. 
To clean the back of the Grate, the inner Hearth, and 
the fronts qf Catt Iron Stows. 

Boil about a quarter of a pound of the best black lead, 
with a pint of small beer, and a bit oT soap the size of a 
walnut. When that is melted, dip a painter's brush, and 
wet the grate, having first brushed off all the soot and 
. dust ; then take a hard brush, and rub it till of a beau- 
tiful brightness. 

Another way to clean Cast Iron, and black Hmrths, 

Mix black lead and whites of eggs well beaten toge- 
ther ; dip a painter's brush, and wet all over, then rub it 
bright with a hard brush. 

To take the Black off the bright Bars qf polished Stoves 

in a few Minutes. 

Rub them well with some of the following mixture on 
a bit of broad cloth ; when the dirt \% t^ivwoN^^, ^\^^ 
them clean, and polish with glass, uotsatv^-^^^^'^^

The mixhtre. — Boil slowl j one pound of soft soap in 
two quarts of water, to one. Of this jelly take three of 
four spoonfuls, and mix to a consistence with emery, 
No. 3. 

To clean Tin Covers, and Patent Peuter Porter Pots, 

Get the finest whiting, which is only sold in large 
cakes, the small being mixed with sand ; mix a little of 
it powdered, with the least drop of sweet oil, and rub 
well, and wipe clean; then dust some dry whKingina 
muslin bag over, and rub bright with dry leallier. The 
last is to prevent rust, which the cook must be careful 
to guard against by wiping dry, and putting by the fire 
when they come from the parlour ; for if but once bung 
up without, the steam will rust the inside. 

To prevent the creaking of a Doar^ 

Rub a bit of soap on the binges. 

j4 strong Paste for Paper. 

To two large spoonfuls of fine flour, put as much 
pounded rosin as will lie on a shilling^; mix with as much 
strong beer as will make it of a due consistence^ and boil 
half an hour. Let it be cold before it is used. 

Fine blacking for Shoes. 

Take four ounces of ivory-black, three ounces of the 
coarsest sugar, a table spoonful of sweet oiI> and a pint 
•f small beer ; mix t^^cm gradually cold.

AH the list of Sweet Dishes, of which abundance are 
given from page 185 to 224, with directions for prepar-' 
ing them, such as Creams, Jellies, and all the finer softs 
of Puddings, Mince Pies, &c. Onilet. ' Macaroni. 
Oysters in Scallops, stewed or pickled. 

Having thus named the sort of things used for the two 
courses, the reader will think of many others. For re- 
moves of Soup and Fish, one or two joints of Meat or 
Fowl, are served ; and for one small course, the articles, 
suited to the second must make a part. Where Vege- 
tables and Fowls, &c. are twice dressed, they add to 
the appearance of the table the first time ; three sweet 
things may form the second appearance without greater 
'expense.

THE ADVENTURES of ROBERT DRURY. 
during Fifteen Years Captivity on the Island of Mia* 
dagascar. Containing a Description of that Island ; 
an Account of its Produce, Manufactures, and Com-s' 
merce j with an Account of the Manners and Cusi 
toms. Wars, Religion, and Civil Policy of the Inha- 
bitants : to which is added, a Vocabulary of the Ma- 
dagascar Language. Written by Himself, and now 
carefully revised and corrected from the original Copy. 
8vo. 8s. 

Among the numerous relations of voyages and travels, ^rbicb 
coQibtnc so much instruction with delight, the Adventures- of 
Robert Drary will be found one of the most interesting andlunos- 
l.ng ; for the work is not that of one who passod rapidly through- 
the scenes which he describes, but the experience of a long se* 
rtes of years spent m captivity. Indeed, the author was become 
so naturalized, that he found much difficulty in regaining bis 
native language. The narration of the numerous destructive 
wars, and the surprising incidents and vicissitudes uf fortane 
which his unfortunate condition induced, together with the dfr* 
scriptions of the customs, the religion, and the productions of 
the country, cannot fail highly to gratify every reader* The 
whole is delivered in an attless style, which enhances the interest 
we feel for the author, as we are more immediately intrc'duced 
to his situation of life, and more habituated to his own modes 
of thinking. 

(< We are glad to see so entertaining a book revived, in its prt^ 
sent very handsome form. It will not be read without interest, 
either by young or old. The authenticity of the narrative has 
been imply confirmed, and the (acts have been adopted by the 
corapilcxt) of geography."

**'The mind of Mr. I^Israeli, naturally smeeptible of -vivid 
impreMions, seemi to have canght a richness of laney ffem 
his. intimacy with oriental poetiy. The pompoua ' imagery 
of the eastern poets is given in an English form so judici- 
ously, that it has' little of that extravagance which would 
mevltably defbrm a bakl translation. l*he romaiKes are 
interspersed with poetry, which, like his prose,-- abbunds 
l^ith luxuriant im4;ery. A richness of language and orien- 
tal iiovelty of thought adorn the poems. The story of 
tcila and Mejnoun is the principal romance, and the more 
highly- to be valued for its beauty and pathos. The succeed-* 
ing one is elq;ant and pleasing, and the third is very ingeaioua.**

U There i^ litde matter of offence in these volumes, bm a 
f;iir and gmeral satire, with such occasional allusions t^

them. We give the author great credit for the quantity of 
reading amassed in his notes, where he produces the actual 
authorities for all the absurdities which he ridicules. The

topics tar satire are throughout admirably well chosen: the

"We have derived con.V:derabIe entertainment from a perusal

written it, has not studied how to form expensive articles for 
luxurious tables, but to combine elegance with economy. She 
has given her directions in a plain sensible manner that every 
body can understand ; and these are not confine d merely to 
cookery, but arc extended to a variety of objcv ts in u&e io fa- 
milies ; by which means, the utility of the book is very much 
increased indeed.** — Anti^yaeohin Review. 

** We will conclude with the mention of a I^Mfy's book on 
C09kery, which, because our account of it vras jocular, some 
readers have supposed we meant to slight. This was by no 
means the case. We considered cookeiy as ^ art not demand- 
ing a grave discussion from grave men, but the book we believe 
to be a good one ; and more practically useful thaa most that 
have appeared, especially for private fitsnilies."— ^rffiiil Critic,
