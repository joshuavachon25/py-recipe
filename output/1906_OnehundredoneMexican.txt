TAMALES 

w w w 



TAMALES are a mixture of 
meat or fowl made hot with 
chiles and wrapped in corn- 
husks* In preparing the dough 
or nixtamaly unless scalded meal is 
used for a substitute, it is necessary 
to prepare the shelled corn with 
lime-water. The Mexicans grind 
the corn prepared in this way, on 
the metate, and instead of a mortar 
use the molcajete and lejolote. 

To prepare the corn, cover it 
with water, add the lime-water and 
boil until the husks slip off easily 
between the fingers, then wash in 
cold water until perfectly white. 
The lime-water is made by adding 
an ounce of common lime to a quart 
of water; stir well and let settle; 
when clear, drain off the water for 
use. One quart of lime-water pre- 
pared in this way will do for a 
pound of corn. For the wrapping, 
cut off the inside leaves of the corn- 
husks about an inch from the stalk 
end and boil in clear water until 
perfectly clean. Tear a few in nar- 
row strips to use for tying the 
ends; dry the rest and rub them 
over with a cloth dipped in hot lard.

USE equal quantities of cold 
boiled chicken and veal, and 
half as much ham, all chop- 
ped. Mix together and moisten 
with good gravy. Season with salt, 
cayenne and a little chopped pars- 
ley. Make a dough by pouring a 
cupful of boiling water on a quart 
of fine, fresh corn-meal; work in a 
big lump of butter and add water 
until like biscuit dough. Have 
ready, as directed, a pile of the 
soft inner leaves or husks of green 
corn. Take a lump of dough about 
the size of an egg; pat it out flat, 
put a tablespoonful of the meat on 
it and roll for the inner husk. 
Then put on the outer husks with 
a thin piece of dough in each. Tie 
the ends and boil in water con- 
taining a few red peppers and a 
clove of garlic.

BOIL three quarts of whole corn 
in ash lye until the hulls 
come off; soak in clear water 
until the lye is all out, then grind. 
Remove the seeds and veins from 
six chile peppers, boil soft and then 
put through a colander to separate 
67 



from the skin. Boil a chicken ten-* 
der and set aside half of the well- 
seasoned broth; the rest, with the 
chicken, thicken with part of the 
ground corn and add the pepper- 
pulp and three tablespoonfuls of 
fine maijoram. For the batter, take 
the remsunder of the broth and 
ground corn and mix into it a table- 
spoonful of olive-oil; season with 
salt and make the dough just thick 
enough to spread. These propor- 
tions will make fifteen tamales.

and a pinch, each, of salt, comino 
seed and marjoram. Scald two 
dozen dry chiles, remove the seeds 
and veins, scrape the pulp from 
the skin, add this to the chicken- 
stew and thicken slightly with flour. 
Shape the corn-husks with scissors 
and soak in warm water for an hour. 
Remove, dry and rub each one with 
hot fat. Fill one with the chicken- 
stew, spread four others with the

and boil fifteen minutes. Drain in 
a colander and save the water in 
which they were last boiled. When 
cold enough to handle, take a knife, 
scrape off all the pulp from the skin, 
and put in the water in which they 
were boiled and mix thoroughly. 
Fry two onions chopped fine in

& 



T AM ALES are a mixture of 
meat or fowl made hot with 
chiles and wrapped in corn- 
husks. In preparing the dough 
or nixtamal, unless scalded meal is 
used for a substitute, it is necessary 
to prepare the shelled corn with 
lime-water. The Mexicans grind 
the corn prepared in this way, on 
the metate, and instead of a mortar 
use the molcajete and lejolote. 

To prepare the corn, cover it 
with water, add the lime-water and 
boil until the husks slip off easily 
between the ringers, then wash in 
cold water until perfectly white. 
The lime-water is made by adding 
an ounce of common lime to a quart 
of water; stir well and let settle; 
when clear, drain off the water for 
use. One quart of lime-water pre- 
pared in this way will do for a 
pound of corn. For the wrapping, 
cut off the inside leaves of the corn- 
husks about an inch from the stalk 
end and boil in clear water until 
perfectly clean. Tear a few in nar- 
row strips to use for tying the 
ends; dry the rest and rub them 
over with a cloth dipped in hot lard.

jf» FARSANTA ff 

USE equal quantities of cold 
boiled chicken and veal, and 
half as much ham, all chop- 
ped. Mix together and moisten 
with good gravy. Season with salt, 
cayenne and a little chopped pars- 
ley. Make a dough by pouring a 
cupful of boiling water on a quart 
of fine, fresh corn-meal ; work in a 
big lump of butter and add water 
until like biscuit dough. Have 
ready, as directed, a pile of the 
soft inner leaves or husks of green 
corn. Take a lump of dough about 
the size of an egg; pat it out flat, 
put a tablespoonful of the meat on 
it and roll for the inner husk. 
Then put on the outer husks with 
a thin piece of dough in each. Tie 
the ends and boil in water con- 
taining a few red peppers and a 
clove of garlic. 

Jf GENUINO fif 

BOIL three quarts of whole corn 
in ash lye until the hulls 
come off; soak in clear water 
until the lye is all out, then grind. 
Remove the seeds and veins from 
six chile peppers, boil soft and then 
put through a colander to separate 
67 



from the skin. Boil a chicken ten- 
der and set aside half of the well- 
seasoned broth; the rest, with the 
chicken, thicken with part of the 
ground corn and add the pepper- 
pulp and three tablespoonfuls of 
fine marjoram. For the batter, take 
the remainder of the broth and 
ground corn and mix into it a table- 
spoonful of olive-oil; season with 
salt and make the dough just thick 
enough to spread. These propor- 
tions will make fifteen tamales. 

If HACIENDA Jf 

GRIND two quarts of hulled 
corn through a meat-chopper 
and mix to a paste with two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt 
and cayenne. Divide a large, fat 
chicken and stew until tender, in 
water containing a clove of garlic 
and a pinch, each, of salt, comino 
seed and marjoram. Scald two 
dozen dry chiles, remove the seeds 
and veins, scrape the pulp from 
the skin, add this to the chicken- 
stew and thicken slightly with flour. 
Shape the corn-husks with scissors 
and soak in warm water for an hour. 
Remove, dry and rub each one with 
hot fat. Fill one with the chicken- 
stew, spread four others with the 
68 



corn-paste; fold over the one con- 
taining the chicken and roll the 
others around. Tie the ends with 
a strip of the husk and steam for 
two hours. 

Jf HOT TAMAL Jp 

FOR the dough, add to one 
pint of corn-meal, one table- 
spoonful, each, of salt and 
lard, and enough boiling water to 
make a thick dough. Prepare the 
corn-husks as directed. For the 
filling boil one pound of beef and 
pour over it hot beef fat; cut into 
small bits and season with salt and 
chile sauce. Put a layer of the 
dough in the husk, over this a 
tablespoonful of the prepared meat; 
roll like a cigarette, with a layer of 
dough between each husk. Tie 
each end and steam two hours. 

LAREDO'S 
* CELEBERRIMO * 

BOIL a pound of pork until 
two-thirds cooked; then grind 
it rather fine. Add a small 
amount of garlic, also a small quan- 
tity of seeded raisins and prepared 
almonds. Soak two and a half 
ounces of chiles in hot water; take 
69 



out the seeds and veins, wash them 
well and grind fine, adding enough 
of the stock in which the meat was 
boiled to make a sauce, and strain. 
For the dough use the ground corn 
prepared with lime-water; add six 
ounces of fresh lard to the pound, 
salt to taste and moisten with the 
meat stock. Have the husks pre- 
pared, spread each with a thin layer 
of dough, and for the center one 
a tablespoonful of the pork and a 
tablespoonful of the chile sauce. 
Roll carefully, tie the ends and 
steam over the liquid in which the 
meat was boiled. 



H* MESA REDONDA ]f 

COVER a four-pound chicken 
with hot water and add four 
onions, a clove of garlic 
chopped fine, a stick of cinnamon, 
ten whole allspice, ten cloves, three 
red chile peppers and a teaspoonful 
of salt. Simmer until the chicken 
is tender, then remove and cut into 
small pieces. Strain the liquor, put 
the chicken meat into it, add enough 
yellow corn-meal to make a thick 
mush and boil ten minutes. Have 
ready the green corn cut from a 
dozen ears and two pounds of rai- 
70 



sins, seeded, and mix these into the 
mush, with a half-teaspoonful of 
cayenne. Fill the center husk with 
a piece of the chicken and some of 
the mush, roll the others around, 
each spread with a tablespoonful of 
the mush. Tie at each end and 
boil an hour. 

$ VIAJERO jf> 

SCALD a quart of good South- 
ern white corn-meal, making 
it moist, but not soft. Have 
a chicken boiled until tender and 
separated into parts; season the 
broth with the pulp of two dozen 
chile peppers, a quart of whole 
olives, two pounds of raisins, a 
cupful of sweet lard, salt and a sus- 
picion of garlic; add enough corn- 
meal to thicken like gravy. Lay 
( one of the prepared husks flat, put 
a piece of chicken on it and two 
tablespoonfuls of the thickened 
gravy ; fold the husk over with the 
chicken inside, and roll around 
this six more husks, spreading each 
with two tablespoonfuls of the 
scalded meal. Tie each end se- 
curely with a narrow strip of the 
husk and steam three hours or 
longer.

ENCHILADAS 



ENCHILADAS are made of 
tortillas sprinkled with 
cheese, onion, olives, etc. 
They are adorned with lettuce 
leaves and radishes, but are always 
covered with hot chile sauce. 

Tortillas are the national staple 
article of food, and are made of 
Indian corn ground on the metate, 
mixed with a little water and cooked 
on a flat surface over hot coals.

SAUCES FOR 
ENCHILADAS 

w w w 

ff CHILE Jf 

CUT open two chiles and take 
out all the seeds and thick 
yellow veins; put them on the 
back of the stove in cold water 
enough to cover them and let soak 
for two hours. Pour off this water 
and cover again with fresh water 
and boil fifteen minutes. Drain in 
a colander and save the water in 
which they were last boiled. When 
cold enough to handle, take a knife, 
scrape off all the pulp from the skin, 
and put in the water in which they 
were boiled and mix thoroughly. 
Fry two onions chopped fine in 
olive-oil to a delicate brown; add 
a teaspoonful of flour and allow 
that to brown also. Stir in the 
chile mixture, season with salt and 
let all thicken together. 

Jf COLD COLORADO Jf 

COOK for fifteen minutes a half- 
pound of large Mexicansweet 
red peppers, after removing 
the seeds of all but two or three. 
55 



Take off the skin, put the pulp 
through a sieve and add one and a 
half tablespoonfuls of the Mexican 
sausage, salt and a little of the 
water in which the peppers were 
boiled. Bottle tightly and it will 
keep about three weeks in a cool 
place. 

Jf MEXICAN CHILE Jf 

TOAST ten chiles anchos (the 
dried pepper in the broad 
shape) and ten chiles -posillos 
(the dried pepper in the thin shape), 
take out the veins and seeds and 
soak them in a quart of boiling 
water. Pass through a sieve twice, 
jetting out all the pulp, and fry 
this chile liquor in two tablespoon- 
fuls of boiling lard, which has been 
thickened with a tablespoonfiil of 
browned flour. While boiling add 
salt, a pinch of Mexican sausage, a 
pinch of sugar, a teaspoonful of 
cider-vinegar and a tablespoonful 
of oil. Cook all together in the 
lard for fifteen minutes. 

|f SALSA NUEZ |f 

SCALD and peel two tomatoes; 
add a minced onion and a few 
pepper seeds, season with salt 
and stew until thick. Strain and 
56 



add a few chopped green walnut 
meats. Reheat and serve hot. This 
sauce is also used with fried peppers. 

Jf TOMATO Jf 

BOIL two pounds of tomatoes 
in a very little water and then 
rub them through a coarse 
sieve. Grind fine a half-pound of 
raisins, a quarter of a pound of 
blanched almonds, an ounce of gar- 
lic, an ounce of green ginger and 
a half-ounce of dried chiles; add 
these to the strained tomatoes with 
an ounce of salt, a half-pound of 
sugar and a pint of vinegar. Boil 
all together until thick.

TORTILLAS 



& HECHO EN CASA J^ 

TAKE three cupfuls of sifted 
flour, a tablespoonful of lard, 
a level teaspoonful of salt 
and enough water to make it like 
pastry dough. Roll very thin and 
cut the size of a dessert plate. Have 
ready in a large frying-pan some 
hot lard, enough to float the tor- 
tillas, but not so hot as to brown 
them. Put in the tortillas, one at 
a time, and when they begin to 
blister they are done. This quan- 
tity will make about two dozen. 

TORTILLAS DE PATATAS 

WORK a large cold boiled 
potato with a big teaspoon- 
ful of lard and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt into a pint of flour and 
add water until about the consist- 
ency of bread dough. Knead thor- 
oughly and divide into chunks 
about the size of an egg and roll 
very thin. Brown very quickly on 
a smooth hot stove, turning often. 
When thoroughly cooked, place 
between a cloth and keep covered 
in this way until ready to use.

Jf AMERICANO J$ 

CUT six large red chile peppers 
in halves, remove the seeds 
and veins and cook in boil- 
ing water fifteen minutes, then press 
through a colander. The sauce 
should be thick and smooth. Chop 
the dark meat of a cold cooked 
chicken, season with salt and add 
two tablespoonfuls of the pepper 
pulp. Beat two eggs without sep- 
arating, very light, and add a cup- 
ful of milk. Mix a half-cupful of 
corn-meal with a cupful of flour 
and a little salt; pour the egg and 
milk in this, making a thin batter. 
Put a little olive-oil in a frying- 
pan, and when boiling hot turn in 
enough batter to make a thin cake 
about six inches in diameter. Shake 
the pan until the mixture is set, 
then put two tablespoonfuls of the 
chicken mixture on one side of the 
cake, roll with a knife and remove 
to the serving-dish. When all are 
made pour over the remaining chile 
sauce and sprinkle the whole with 
grated Parmesan cheese. 
59 



Jf DOMESTICO 'ft 

HAVE ready two cupfuls of 
cold cooked chicken cut into 
small bits, over which pour 
the juice of a lemon and sprinkle 
with chopped parsley. Also chop 
two onions very fine and three hard- 
boiled eggs; grate a pound of good 
cheese, wash a large cupful of rai- 
sins and dry them; have three 
dozen green or ripe olives handy 
and the chile sauce piping hot. 
Dip the tortillas in the hot sauce, 
place on a large platter and on 
one-half of it put a little of the 
onion, egg, chicken, cheese, two rai- 
sins, one olive, and lastly a spoonful 
of the chile sauce. Fold over the 
other half and roll slightly. When 
they are all finished, sprinkle cheese 
over all and pour over what chile 
sauce is left. 



^ MEXICAN Jff 

BOIL eight large Mexican pep- 
pers until tender; remove 
skin and seeds and put the 
pulp through a sieve. Into two 
tablespoonfuls of smoking hot olive- 
oil put two sections of garlic, a tea- 
spoonful of fine marjoram and salt; 
add the pepper-pulp and cook 
60 



slowly. Chop two onions very fine, 
season with salt and pepper and 
sprinkle with a little marjoram and 
let stand in a very little vinegar. 
Grate a pound of Edam cheese. 
Strain the sauce and return to the 
stove; dip a tortilla in the sauce, 
place on a plate and spread it with 
a teaspoonful, each, of the drained 
onion and the cheese; add two 
olives, two large seedless raisins 
and a tablespoonful of the chile. 
Roll the tortilla and sprinkle each 
with onion and cheese. After all 
are made, pour over the remaining 
chile and garnish with olives. 

Jf NATIVO Jf 

BUY a dozen tortillas and put 
on a tin in the oven to keep 
warm. Remove veins and 
seeds from a half-dozen chile pep- 
pers and boil them with a small 
onion and a clove of garlic until all 
are soft. Press through a colander, 
with the water in which they were 
boiled and return the sauce to the 
stove to keep hot. Tear three 
heads of lettuce into bits, cover 
with a French dressing and mix 
with it a cupful of chopped olives 
and six hard-boiled eggs, chopped. 
Drop each tortilla in hot lard for a 
61 



minute, then in the sauce; place on 
a hot platter and put a big spoon- 
ful of the salad mixture in the cen- 
ter. Sprinkle generously with 
grated cheese and fold over one 
side, and roll. When all are ready 
pour over the remaining sauce and 
serve hot. 

ff QUESADILLAS Jf 

MAKE thin corn-meal pan- 
cakes six inches across. Dip 
one in hot chile sauce, lay 
on a plate and cover with raw onion 
chopped fine, grated cheese and 
stoned olives cut in half. Lay on 
this six other pancakes, each dipped 
in the chile sauce and covered with 
the onion, cheese and olives. Pour 
the remaining sauce over the top 
and set in a hot oven for a few 
minutes. Serve hot, cutting like 
layer-cake.

TAMALES 



Jfi 



TAMALES are a mixture of 
meat or fowl made hot with 
chiles and wrapped in corn- 
husks. In preparing the dough 
or nixtamal, unless scalded meal is 
used for a substitute, it is necessary 
to prepare the shelled corn with 
lime-water. The Mexicans grind 
the corn prepared in this way, on 
the metate, and instead of a mortar 
use the molcajete and lejolote. 

To prepare the corn, cover it 
with water, add the lime-water and 
boil until the husks slip off easily 
between the fingers, then wash in 
cold water until perfectly white. 
The lime-water is made by adding 
an ounce of common lime to a quart 
of water; stir well and let settle; 
when clear, drain off the water for 
use. One quart of lime-water pre- 
pared in this way will do for a 
pound of corn. For the wrapping, 
cut off the inside leaves of the corn- 
husks about an inch from the stalk 
end and boil in clear water until 
perfectly clean. Tear a few in nar- 
row strips to use for tying the 
ends; dry the rest and rub them 
over with a cloth dipped in hot lard. 



65 



Jf FARSANTA Jf 

USE equal quantities of cold 
boiled chicken and veal, and 
half as much ham, all chop- 
ped. Mix together and moisten 
with good gravy. Season with salt, 
cayenne and a little chopped pars- 
ley. Make a dough by pouring a 
cupful of boiling water on a quart 
of fine, fresh corn-meal; work in a 
big lump of butter and add water 
until like biscuit dough. Have 
ready, as directed, a pile of the 
soft inner leaves or husks of green 
corn. Take a lump of dough about 
the size of an egg; pat it out flat, 
put a tablespoonful of the meat on 
it and roll for the inner husk. 
Then put on the outer husks with 
a thin piece of dough in each. Tie 
the ends and boil in water con- 
taining a few red peppers and a 
clove of garlic. 



Jf GENUINO Jf 

BOIL three quarts of whole corn 
in ash lye until the hulls 
come off; soak in clear water 
until the lye is all out, then grind. 
Remove the seeds and veins from 
six chile peppers, boil soft and then 
put through a colander to separate 
67 



from the skin. Boil a chicken ten- 
der and set aside half of the well- 
seasoned broth; the rest, with the 
chicken, thicken with part of the 
ground corn and add the pepper- 
pulp and three tablespoonfuls of 
fine marjoram. For the batter, take 
the remainder of the broth and 
ground corn and mix into it a table- 
spoonful of olive-oil; season with 
salt and make the dough just thick 
enough to spread. These propor- 
tions will make fifteen tamales. 

Jf HACIENDA Jf 

GRIND two quarts of hulled 
corn through a meat-chopper 
and mix to a paste with two 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter, salt 
and cayenne. Divide a large, fat 
chicken and stew until tender, in 
water containing a clove of garlic 
and a pinch, each, of salt, comino 
seed and marjoram. Scald two 
dozen dry chiles, remove the seeds 
and veins, scrape the pulp from 
the skin, add this to the chicken- 
stew and thicken slightly with flour. 
Shape the corn-husks with scissors 
and soak in warm water for an hour. 
Remove, dry and rub each one with 
hot fat. Fill one with the chicken- 
stew, spread four others with the 
68 



corn-paste; fold over the one con- 
taining the chicken and roll the 
others around. Tie the ends with 
a strip of the husk and steam for 
two hours. 

JfF HOT TAMAL }f 

FOR the dough, add to one 
pint of corn-meal, one table- 
spoonful, each, of salt and 
lard, and enough boiling water to 
make a thick dough. Prepare the 
corn-husks as directed. For the 
filling boil one pound of beef and 
pour over it hot beef fat; cut into 
small bits and season with salt and 
chile sauce. Put a layer of the 
dough in the husk, over this a 
tablespoonful of the prepared meat; 
roll like a cigarette, with a layer of 
dough between each husk. Tie 
each end and steam two hours. 

LAREDO'S 

CELE'BERRIMO 

BOIL a pound of pork until 
two-thirds cooked; thengrind 
it rather fine. Add a small 
amount of garlic, also a small quan- 
tity of seeded raisins and prepared 
almonds. Soak two and a half 
ounces of chiles in hot water; take 
69 



out the seeds and veins, wash them 
well and grind fine, adding enough 
of the stock in which the meat was 
boiled to make a sauce, and strain. 
For the dough use the ground corn 
prepared with lime-water; add six 
ounces of fresh lard to the pound, 
salt to taste and moisten with the 
meat stock. Have the husks pre- 
pared, spread each with a thin layer 
of dough, and for the center one. 
a tablespoonful of the pork and a 
tablespoonrul of the chile sauce. 
Roll carefully, tie the ends and 
steam over the liquid in which the 
meat was boiled. 



If MESA REDONDA Jf 

COVER a four-pound chicken 
with hot water and add four 
onions, a clove of garlic 
chopped fine, a stick of cinnamon, 
ten whole allspice, ten cloves, three 
red chile peppers and a teaspoonful 
of salt. Simmer until the chicken 
is tender, then remove and cut into 
small pieces. Strain the liquor, put 
the chicken meat into it, add enough 
yellow corn-meal to make a thick 
mush and boil ten minutes. Have 
ready the green corn cut from a 
dozen ears and two pounds of rai- 
70 



sins, seeded, and mix these into the 
mush, with a half-teaspoonful of 
cayenne. Fill the center husk with 
a piece of the chicken and some of 
the mush, roll the others around, 
each spread with a tablespoonful of 
the mush. Tie at each end and 
boil an hour. 



Jf VIAJERO ~ff 

SCALD a quart of good South- 
ern white corn-meal, making 
it moist, but not soft. Have 
a chicken boiled until tender and 
separated into parts; season the 
broth with the pulp of two dozen 
chile peppers, a quart of whole 
olives, two pounds of raisins, a 
cupful of sweet lard, salt and a sus- 
picion of garlic; add enough corn- 
meal to thicken like gravy. Lay 
one of the prepared husks flat, put 
a piece of chicken on it and two 
tablespoonfuls of the thickened 
gravy; fold the husk over with the 
chicken inside, and roll around 
this six more husks, spreading each 
with two tablespoonfuls of the 
scalded meal. Tie each end se- 
curely with a narrow strip of the 
husk and steam three hours or 
longer.
