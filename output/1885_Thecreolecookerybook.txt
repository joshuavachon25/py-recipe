This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

PREFACE. 



Tlie literary world has for years been replete with tlie economical and 
fiUceesAf^l experiences of the thrifty Northern housewife, while New Orleans, 
where, as Thackeray says, " you can eat the most and suffer the least, where 
claret is as good as it is at Bordeaux, and where a bouillabaisse can be had, 
than which a better was not eaten at Marseilles," has heretofore appeared 
indifferent to this laudable ambition of her distant neighbors in thus neglect- 
ing that all important addition to her literature. 

/ The moral influences of good cooking haye been too frequently and forcibly 
put before us in works of a weightier character, too amply illustrated by 
historical fucp^ to necessitate anything here but a passing notice to that 
effect. 

In this time, glorious with the general diffusion of learning, it is befitting 
that the occult •oience of the gumbo should cease to be the hereditary lore 
of our negro mammies, and should be allowed its proper place in the gastro^ 
nomioal world. 

The time is now ripe for a new " Almanach des Gtourmande," and the 
following collected recipes, with their prestige of great names, including 
what is best in ^he Creole and American cuisine, are introduced, with the 
modest hope that they may prove to both public and publisher a source of 
rich, practical benefit.

SOUP MAKING. 

Some one has said, " that a well made soup is not only 
one of the most wholesome forms in which food can be taken, 
but it is also one of the most economical." Take for example 
our New Orleans Gumbo, which can be made of scraps of 
cold meat or fowl, a few oysters, crabs or shrimps, and, with 
a couple of spoonfuls of well cooked rice, is a very satisfy- 
ing and economical dinner. Even a rich soup is less ex- 
pensive than almost any other dish. It seems to us, that 
this branch of cooking has been rather neglected by our 
southern housekeepers, so we have given a larger number 
of receipts for soups than will be found in other cookery 
books. In colder climates, soup stock can be made and 
kept for several days, but in our warm, moist climate, it 
would become sour, so must be prepared each day. 

In making soup, special care should be taken of the vessels, 
to have them perfectly clean ; the meat and vegetables well 
Washed and carefully prepared. Soup should be boiled slowly 
for four or five hours; skimmed thdroughly when it first 
begins to boil, for it cannot be easily made clear afterwards, 
and no grease should be left to float on the top. Add vegeta- 
bles and herbs as soon as the soup has been well skimmed 
and the grease ceases to rise. When the meat and vege- 
tables have been fried or browned, boiling water must be 
added in small quantities, but otherwise, always use cold 
water. For thickening soups, use arrowroot, rice flour, or 
corn starch, mixed with a little cold water, and stirred in 
about ten minutes before the soup is dished. The soup 
should boil quickly after the thickening is added. Use very 
little salt, as the lack of it can be remedied — spices should 
be used whole and sparingly. All soups must be served 
very hot. 



Z CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

CRAB SOUP. 

Have ready one dozenjarge crabs ; separate the fat from 
the back shell and bodies; cleanse them from the dead 
men's fingers ; boil the claws and pick the meat from them ; 
have ready a large stew-pan, into which put one tablespoon- 
ful of lard, two of butter, one large onion; cut up into not 
very small pieces ; one clove of garlic ; allow this to brown 
a little, then add one whole can of tomatoes, or 18 or 20 fresh 
ones ; after they have stewed 10 minutes, add the meat from 
the crab claws, then the crabs ; season with salt and black 
and red pepper, the rind of a lemon, and one tablespoonful 
of the juice ; sift over this about one-half dozen grated soda 
crackers ; then add boiling water to make the required quan- 
tity of soup, and allow it to boil moderately for two hours ; 
a little while before serving, add the fat from the crabs and 
a little thyme, parsley and sweet marjoram. This receipt 
will serve soup for about 12 persons. 

GUMBO D'HERBES— GREEN GUMBO. 

Take equal portions of young cabbage leaves, beet leaves, 
turnip leaves, mustard leaves, spinach, cresses, parsley,, 
green onions, and place them in boiling water ; when well 
boiled, chop them fine; make a good soup (brown gravy) 
in which you put beef and ham to fry a little ; then add your 
vegetables (or herbs); stir often and let them fry about 
one hour, keeping the pot well covered ; then add the re- 
quired quantity of hot water, and let it all boil gently for 
about two hours. By adding hot pepper, yoii will have 
a real " Creole Gumbo." 

TURTLE SOUP. 

Take the whole of the turtle out of the shell ; cut it in 
pieces, that it may be more easily scalded. Throw these 
pieces, with the fins, into the pot, and when scalded, take 
oft the coarse skin of the fins and lay them aside to make 
another dish. The thick skin of the stomach must also be 



I 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK, 3 

taken off: under it lies the fat, or what is termed the citron. 
Thus prepared, it is ready for making the soup. Cut up 
the turtle in small pieces, throw them into a pot. But be- 
fore doing this, take a leg of beef and boil it to a gravy ; 
then put in the pieces of turtle, adding as miich water as will 
cover the whole, abSut 2 inches. Let it boil slowly for 3 
hours. The seasoning and the citron should be put in when 
the soup is half done. To 2 quarts and a half of soup add 
^ an ounce of mace, a dessertspoonful of allspice, ^ tea- 
spoonful of cloves, and salt, black and cayenne pepper to 
your taste. Use parsley, thyme, and onions in the soup 
while boiling; when nearly done thicken with 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of flour. To give it a good color, take a tablespoonful 
of brown sugar and burn it ; when sufficiently burnt add a 
wineglass of water ; of this coloring use 2 tablespoonfuls in 
the soup. The forcemeat for the balls may be made with 
a bit of the turtle, a small piece of ham, and seasoned high- 
ly with sweet herbs ; add the yolk of one egg, roll it into the 
balls, fry them and put them into the soup ; boil ^ a dozen 
eggs hard, slice them and put them in after adding ^ a pint 
of Madeira wine. After the wine cooks a little, the soup 
will be ready for table. 

GUMBO AUX HERBES. 

Take equal parts of cabbage leaves, beet leaves, turnip 
leaves, mustard leaves, spinachj^Cresses, parsley and green 
onions; soak' them and wash them thoroughly, and trim 
them by taking off the coarse mid rib of the leaf; boil them 
for at least two hours ; add to ^he water a teaspoonful of 
cooking soda, strain them and chop up as you would spin- 
ach. Take a piece of veal brisket and a slice of ham, which 
should be cut into small pieces, add a large onion, chopped 
fine, salt and pepper ; fry all in a heaping spoonful of lard 
to a rich brown ; now add the greens, stirring with a wooden 
spoon, and then add as much hot water as will make suffi- 
cient gumbo for the family. Serve with boiled rice.

TERRAPIN OR GOPHER SOUP. 

Take a large fresh water terrapin, clean and place it in a di- 
gester with 2 quarts of water, a slice of bacon^ 2 dozen clovesj 
3 dozen allspice, salt, black and red pepper ; boil this for 
3 or 4 hours; thicken and brown it, l^fore serving it up; 
throw in a glass Qf wine, in which has been grated half a 
•nutmeg. 

% CLEAR SOUP. 

Have 5 or 6 pounds of lean beef from above the knee 
cut into small pieces, and the bones chopped ; add a^ slice 
of ham cut fine ; put this on in wabout 6 quarts of cold water. 
Let the soup come to a boil £ind skim it well; throw 
in a tablespoonful of salt and a half tea cup of cold 
water, to help the s6up to throw up the scum better, 
which must all be carefully taken off until it ceases to 
rise; now add one large or two medium sized onions, 
two carrots, cut fine, and one or two nieces of celery ; let this 
boil slowly from 6 to 8 hours, or until the broth is reduced to 
one-half the quantity ; your meat should be cooked to pieces *, 
pass all through a cullender and strain all through a coarse 
cloth ; put this in a cold place until the next day,when it will 
be jellied, provided the weather is sufficientljr cold ; skim all 
the grease x;arefully from the top ; take the jelly, or soup as 
it may be, and pour it carefully into another vessel without 
disturbing the bottom, anff heat it well ; have a bowl of ice 
^ water with a piece of ice in it to keep the water cold; have 
^''a clean flannel cloth, or bag, well wet, which clip in the ice 
:js:ater, and pass a small quantity of the broth at a time 
through the bag, constantly shaking the dregs frdm the 
flannel and wetting it with ice water ; season highly with 
cayenne* pepper, and salt to the taste ; heat it now to serve, 
adding vermicelli, maccaroni or pates, as you like. If the 
meat is good and the soup is madiB properly it will be per- 
fectly clear, but if cloudy before you strain it, « beat the

whites of three eggs stiff, and pour them into the soup and 
let all come to a good boil ; let it- set about five minutes 
before you strain. — Mrs, R. Pritchard. 

PEA SOUP. 

To 2 quarts of spHt peas, put 2 gallons of water, a hand- 
ful of parsley, a little cayenne pepper, salt aiid celery seed, 
to suit taste. Put the peas in soak the night before, and 
after boiling pass through a sieve ; then add a large lump of 
good butter. ' 

CLEAR GRAVY SOUP. 

Wash a piece of fresh beef; put in on the night before it 
is wanted ; boil it several hours until perfectly tender ; then 
take it off and strain it.' In the morning separate every 
particle of fat from it and put it oy^ the fire ; season it with 
)>epper and salt, and put in a spoonful of sage to c«rlor it; 
then prepare the vegetables nicely : carrots, celery, and tur- 
nips, cut small and boiled in the soup till tender. ^^ 

'corn soup. 

r 

Take young corn, and cut the ears across; then grate them 
in water, 2 ears to a^int ; about 6 quarts will make a good 
tureen of soup ; to this quantity put a piece of pork and 
seasoning to your taste : vegetables if you like. It must 
boil 3 hours. 

VEGETABl^E SOUP. 

Soak all night, in dbld water, either two quarts of yellow 
split peas, oif two quarts of dried white beans. In the morn- 
ing drain them, and season them with a very little salt and 
cayemie, and a head of minced celery, or else a heaped ta- 
blespoopful of celery seed. Put them into a soup pot with 
four quarts of water, and boil them slowly till tl^jey are all { 

dissolved. Stir them frequently. Have ready a quantity of 
fresh vegetables,'such aa turnips, carrots, parsnips, potatoes, 
onions, also salsify, and asparagus tops. Put in first the 
vegetables that require the longest boiling. They should all 






6 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

be cut into small pieces. Enrich the whole with some 
bits of fresh butter rolled in flour. Boil these vegetables in 
the soup till they are quite tender, put it in a tureen and 

» 

serve it up. 

POTATO SOUP. 

Pare and slice thin half a dozen fine potatoes and a 
small onion. Boil them in three pints of water till so soft 
that you can pulp them through a cullender. When re- 
turned to the pot add a very little salt and cayenne pepper, 
and a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, divided into bits, 
and boil it 10 minutes longer. When you put it intp the 
tureen, stir in 2 tablespoonfula or more of sweet cream. 
This is a nice soup for Fridays, or for invalids. 

qOCOANUT SOUP. 

Take eight calves' feet that have been scalded and scraped 
but not skinned, and put them into a soup kettle with 6 or 
7 blades of mace, and the yellow rind of a lemon grated. 
Pour on a gallon of water, cover the • kettle and let it boil 
very slowly (skimming it well) till the flesh is reduced to 
rags and has dropped entirely from the bones. Then strain 
it into a broad white-ware pan, and set it away to get cool. 
When it has congealed, scrape ofi the fat and sediment, cut 
up the cake of jelly (or stock) and put it into a clean porce- 
lain kettle. Have ready half a pound of grated cocoanut 
(very fine), mix it with a pint of cream or rich milk, three 
ounces of the best fresh butter divided into three parts, each 
bit rolled in arrowroot or rice flour. Mix it gradually with 
the cocoanut, and add it to the calves' feet stock in the ket- 
tle, seasoned with a small nutmeg grated. Set it over the 
fire and boil it, slowly, about a quarter of an hour ; .stirring 
it well. Then put it into a tureen and serve it up. French 
rolls or light milk biscuits are very nice to eat with it; also 
powdered sugar, in case any of the company should wish to 
sweeten it. 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 7 

GROUNDNUT SOUP. 

To half a pint of shelled ground nuts, well beaten up, add 
two spoonfuls of* flour, and mix well. Put to them a pint 
of oysters, and a pint and a half of water, while boiling. 
Throw in a red pepper, or two, if small. 

CHESTNUT SOUP. 

Make in the best manner, a soup of the lean of fresh beef, 
mutton or venison; season with cayenne pepper and a little 
salt, allowing rather less than a quart of water to each pound 
•of meat ; skimming and boiling it till the meat drops from the 
bone ; strain it, and put it in a clean pot ; have ready a quart 
or more of nice chestnuts, boiled and peeled ; put them in- 
to the soup, with some small bits of fresh butter rolled in 
flour ; boil the soup 10 minutes longer before it goes to the 
table. 

CRAB SOUP. 

Open and cleanse of the deadmen's fingers and sand, 18 
young fat crabs, (raw), cut them into 4 parts and extract 
the meat from the crabs and the fat from the top of the shells ; 
scald and skin 12 fine, ripe tomatoes ; squeeze the pulp from 
the seeds and juice ; chop fine ; pour boiling water over seed 
and juice, and after straining it ofl, use to make the soup, 
adding more water, if required ; stew in soup pot, one large 
onion and one clove of garlic in one spoonful of butter and 
two of lard ; then put in tomatoes ; after stewing a few min- 
utes, add the meat from the claws, then the crabs, and lastly, 
the fat from the top shells; sift over it grated bread or 
crackers; season with salt, pepper, (black or cayenne) pars- 
ley, sweet marjoram, thyme, half teaspoonful of lemon juice 
and the peel of a lemon ; pour in water in which seeds were 
scalded, and boil moderately for one hour. Firm and flaky 
fish prepared in the same way, make delicious soup. I use 
twelve good sized crabs, and think more lemon jidce an 
improvement.

FRENCH SOUP. 

Take the fleshy part of a rump of beef, put it on the fire 
early in the morning to boil ; skim all the gnease off; thyme, 
parsley and salt, put in with the rump ; after the soup is 
sufficiently boiled and the grease carefully taken oflf, put in 
the small white onions and a few carrots cut round ; then 
add cloves and allspice; just before you are ready to dish 
the soup, put two teaspoonfuls of brown sugar, to turn it 
darjk. No flour is used. 

OYSTER SOUR 

' Take one hundred oysters, strain them through a cullen- 
der and set the liquor to boil ; when the scum has all risen 
and been taken off", add two quarts of water, a tablespoon- 
fiil of butter, one pint of rich milk or cream, mace, nutmeg, 
pepper and salt to the taste ; boil these ingredients together, 
and just before serving up, throw in the oysters. If the 
soup be too thin, stir in a little wheat flour a few minutes 
before serving up. 

OYSTER SOUP FOR SIX PERSONS. 

Strain and drain two quarts of oysters ; if you have less 
than a quart of liquor, make up that amount with water ; 
add a handful of chopped ham, fat and lean, a few blades of 
mace, one-fourth of a large onion ; salt and pepper to taste ; 
boil one hour, then strain; make a tablespoonful of flour 
and a quarter pound of butter into a soft paste ; set aside ; 
put oysters into liquor, give them 8 or 10 minutes to plump 
up, then stir in the paste, and leave until dinner is ready ; 
put the soup on again until it comes to a boil ; add a pint 
each of milk and cream ; stir all the time until it boils again, 
then dish and serve immediately. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Take 2 quarts of oysters with the liquor ; put 3 quarts of 
water, 8 slices of lean ham, and 2 onions; boil this down to 
half the quantity ; then run it through a cullender, and put 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 9 

the liquor alone back into the pot and let it come just to a 
boil ; while the oysters are boiling, beat up the yolks of 6 
eggs with 4 tablepoonfuls of wheat flour and 1 pint of rich 
milk; stir this into the oyster liquor, after it has been 
strained and made boiling hot ; add a quart of raw oysters 
and let the whole thicken a little on the fire ; add then 1 
teaspoonful of white pepper and a half of grated nutmeg. 

OYSTER SOUP, 

Three pints of large, fresh oysters, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
butter, rolled in flour, a bunch of sweet herbs, a saucer full 
of chopped celery, a quart of rich milk, pepper to your taste. 
As soon as the ingredients boil, take out the herbs and put 
in the oysters just before you send it to table. Boiling 
them a long time in the soup will shrivel them and destroy 
the flavor. The liqiior must be taken from the 3 pints of 
oysters, strained, and set on the fire to make the soup. 

MRS. COOLIDGE'S OYSTER SOUP. 

Strain the liquor from 1^ pints of oysters, into a sauce-

CALF'S HEAD SOUP. 

Clean thoroughly ; remove the eyes, teeth, a^nd nose bone, 
making the skin smooth and white as possible. Clean the 
liver, lights, feet and heart ; put all these into an iron pot ; 
cover with water and add salt enough to make the scum rise, 
about 2 tablespoonfuls ; boil all until the meat cleaves from 
the scull bone, and the liver is tender to the touch of the 
fork ; put the meat in a separate pot, cover with water and 
boil until the meat slips from the bone ; the feet require so 
much more boiling than the head, that it is necessary to 
boil them separately. Fish out the head with a long skim- 
mer, then pour out the liquor ; wash the pot and strain the

FOWL. 



WILD DUCKS OR TEAL. 

You must be particular in not roasting these birds too 
much ; a duck, about 15 minutes with a good fire ; baste 
them very frequently. A teal will, of course, take less time, 
but the fire and motion of the spit must be attended to ; 
and when you dish it, draw the knife four times down the 
breast; have ready, a little hot butter, the juice of a lemon, 
cayenne pepper, a little dust of sugar, a glass of port wine ; 
pour it hot over the ducks. 

ROAST FOWLS. 
If nicely trussed, make a stuffing of butter and some 
pepper; drj' up the butter with a few bread crumbs; baste 
it well ; add flour and salt before you take it from the fire. 
It is very nice to stufi the fowl with good sausage meat, 
truffles, or chestnuts. 

ROAST FOWL. 

Clean the fowl thoroughly ; roast it 20 minutes, unless a 
very fine one ; it will then take 3 quarters of an hour ; serve 
with bread sauce, or parsley and butter ; egg sauce is some- 
times sent to table with it. If a small lump of butter, well 
covered with black pepper, is placed within the fowl previ- 
ous to roasting, it will be found to improve the fowl, by re- 
moving the dryness which is met with in the back and side 
bones. 

TO STEW PARTRIDGES. 

After trussing the partridges, stuff them with force meat ; 
then rub a lump of butter in pepper, salt, and powdered 
mace, and put it into the bodies; sew them up, and after 
dredging them with fine flour, fry them in butter, of a lights

brown ; then put them in a stewpan with gravy sufficient 
to cover them ; 2 spoonfuls of lemon pickle or anchovy, a 
quarter of a lemon sliced, and a sprig of sweet marjoram ; 
cover them closely, and stew them for about ^ hour. If 
necessary, thicken the gravy. 

BROWN PRICASEE. 

The beef or veal is to be chopped very fine ; take out all 
the stringy parts ; season it with pepper, salt and a little 
ginger; beat up 4 eggs very light; a large plateful of stale 
bread ; make them in balls ; roll them in flour and fry them ; 
then take 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed with cold water ; 
put some seasoning and hot water into the frying pan ; after 
it has boiled throw it over the balls and let it stew about 15 
minutes before dishing them in tomato or walnut catsup. 
To the 4 eggs, take S lbs. of veal and full i of bread. 

STEWED DUCKS. 

Truss the ducks and stuff them with bread, butter and 
onions : place then with lard in a frying pan ; have prepared 
in an iron pot slips of bacon, giblets, water, pepper, salt, a 
little mace or cloves, if you like it ; put in the ducks and let 
them stew gently, but constantly, for 2 hours; then add 
lemon juice or lemon pickle. Flour the ducks each time 
that you turn them in the pot. Thicken with butter rolled 
in flour. This receipt is for large ducks ; those not grown 
require less time. 

STEWED PIGEONS. 

Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, cloves, mace and 
sweet herbs ; wrap this seasoning up in a piece of butter and 
put in and stuff them ; tie up the neck and vent, and half 
roast them ; then put them in the saucepan, with 1 quart 
of good gravy, a little white wine, some picked mushrooms, 
pepper corns, a slice of onion, and some pickled oysters ; 
stew all together till sufficiently done ; then thicken it with 
butter and the yolk of.l egg; garnish with lemons.

a fricasee ; take the onions, parsley and the liver, cut it 
small ; take 6 spoonfuls of claret wine, 3 of vinegar, and dis- 
solve 2 or 3 anchovies into it ; put all this in the stewpan 
with i lb. of fresh butter worked up with flour ; thicken it 
and serve it up. Ducks done in the same way are very 
nice. 

DUCKS A LA MODE. 

Take 2 fine ducks, cut them into quarters, fry them in 
butter a little brown ; pour ofl all the fat and throw a little 
flour over them ; add ^ pint of good gravy, i of a pint of

them close ; let them stew 15 minutes ; take out the herbs ; 
skim ofl the grease and let the sauce be as thick as cream ; 
send it to table ; garnish it with lemon. 

ROAST DUCKS. 

Ducks should be well plucked without tearing the skin, 
all the plugs being removed, clean the inside thoroughly 
with a little warm water, and stufl them with bread and 
butter, onion, sage, pepper and salt; roast them before a 
brisk fire, but not too close ; baste very frequently ; they 
will take from i hour to 1 hour, much depends on the age 
and size ; when the breast plumps, they will be done ; serve 
them with a rich brown gravy. 

BOILED DUCKS. 

Clean and pluck them, let the skin be preserved from 
rents ; salt them for 30 hours previous to cooking ; flour a 
clean white cloth and boil them in It. A moderate sized 
4uck will take about 1 hour's boiling ; make a rich onion 
sauce with milk, and send it to table with the duck. When 
the duck is boiled fresh it may be stufied as for roasting 
and served with the same description of gravy.

TO HASH DUCKS. 

The same receipt may be followed as for hashing fowl 
and game, with the exception that it will not require as 
much time to stew. 

TO STEW DUCKS. 

There is a difference between a stewed duck and stewed 
duck, and it is not the a alone ; in the one case the duck is 
stewed whole, and in the other in pieces. To stew a duck, 
or ducks, they should be roasted for 20 minutes, and then 
placed in a stewpan with an onion, cut in slices, a little 
sage and mint and sweet herbs chopped fine, and about a 
pint of good beef gravy, seasoned with pepper and salt ; let 
it stew gently for 20 minutes ; take out the duck carefuU}' 
and keep it warm ; strain the gravy ; pour it into a clean 
stewpan, and add to it, when well heated, the duck and a 
quart of green peas; let it simmer for a half hour ; then add 
a little flour ani butter, a glass of port wine, and send to 
table, with the peas in the same dish as the* duck. 

STEWED DUCK. 

The ducks should be cut into joints and laid into a stew- 
pan with a pint of good gravy ; let it come to a boil ; as the 
scum rises, remove it; season with salt and cayenne; let it 
stew gently three-quarters of an hour ; mix smoothly 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of fine ground rice with a glass of port wine ; stir 
it into the gravy ; let it have 7 or 8 minutes to amalgamate 
with the gravy ; dish and send it to table very hot. 

BATTERED CHICKEN. 

Make a light batter with 3 eggs, a small tablespoonful of 
butter, a little wheat flour, and salt to the taste ; joint the 
chicken, and put them into the batter ; grease the frying 
pan, throw the mixture of chicken and batter into it and 
fry a good brown. This quantity of batter will suffice for 
one pair of chickens.

CREOLE COOKBBY BOOK. 39 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Having cut up a pair of young chickens, lay them in a 
pan of cold water to extract the blood ; wipe them dry ; sea- 
son with pepper and salt, dredge them with flour, and fry 
them in lard ; both sides should be of a rich brown ; take 
them out of the pan and keep them near the fire ; skim care- 
fully the gravy in which the chickens have been fried, mix 
it with \ pint of cream ; season with a little mace, pepper and 
salt, adding some parsley. 

TO MAKE A FRENCH PILAU. 

Boil a pair of fowls ; when done, take them out and put 
the rice in the same water, first taking out some of the 
liquor ; when the rice is done, butter it well, cover the bot- 
tom of the dish with ^ of it, then put the fowls on it and 
add the remainder of the liquor ; cover the fowls with the 
other \ of the rice, make it smooth, and spread over it 
the yolks of 2 eggs, well beaten ; bake in a moderate oven.

and put in a small piece of pork ; boil until the chicken falls 
from the bone ; select the white meat, and mince or mash 
in a mortar until it becomes paste; put in a skillet; place 
this where it will keep warm, and add nearly as much but- 
ter as you have chicken, a little salt, pepper, mace and 
celery seed, if you choose ; boil a small, delicate onion, 
chopped fine ; and mix through it when simmered ; let it.be- 
come quite firm and cold before pressing into jelly jars ; it 
will keep some days in a cool place, and is a good relish for 
lunch or tea. 

WHITE FRICASEE OF CHICKEN. 

Cut a pair of chickens, wash the pieces through 2 or 3 
waters ; lay them in a large pan ; sprinkle slightly with salt

them simmer for I of an hour; serve with parsley and but- 
ter, or oysters or celery sauce. 

COLD FOWLS.

be done with a short knife, and with precision ; the slices 
from the breast should be well cut and the whole arranged 
tastefully in the center of the dish, a layer of ham and 
tongue in alternate pieces may be laid around the dish, and 
handsome sprigs of parsley may garnish the dish. 

POTTED PIGEONS. 

First, wash them. For dressing, bread crumbs, plenty of 
sweet marjoram; a little salt, pepper, 1 egg, and either 
chopped pork, or piece of butter (very little) ; stuff and lay

less, as may be necessary. 

BROILED CHICKENS. 

Split a pair of chickens down the back ; wipe the inside, 
season with pepper and salt ; prepare some beaten yolks of 
eggs and bread crumbs ; dip the outside of the chickens in 
the batter; put them on a gridiron (nicely washed) on a 
bed of bright coals. Lay the chickens on the gridiron, 
with the inside down, broiling them 20 minutes ; just be- 
fore taking them from the fire, add bits of butter. None 
but fine plump chickens are worth broiling. 

COQUI|:.LES DE VOLAILLE.

parsley, salt, cayenne pepper, a little eschallot, and a very 
little onion. Add a tumblerful of cream, a box of mush- 
rooms, and a small can of truf&es ; then put in the chicken, 
and stir all well, and allow it to cook a little. Now add a 
wineglass of sherry. Put the mixture into shell, sprinkle 
bread crumbs over the top, and set in the oven to brown. 

• CROQUETTES— CHICKEN. 

Boil a chicken tenderly ; when cold, chop fine, put some 
of its liquor in pan with butter the size of a hen's egg, 
mix in a little flour, salt, red and black pepper, parsley, and 
small onion; add the minced chicken; and, when cold, 
shape, dip in egg with grated bread, and fry in lard. 

CROQUETTES. 

Of turkey, beef, chicken, or sweet bread, chop the meat 
very fine ; add grated bread crumbs ; season with a little 
grated lemon peel, salt, pepper, a very little nutmeg, and 
yolk of a hard boiled egg ; moisten the whole with enough 
milk to make the ingredients adhere ; form into cones, or 
pear-shaped balls ; dip each into a batter of eggs, well 
beaten, and roll in bread crumbs, fry brown in butter, and 
serve with fried parsley. Croquettes are improved by add- 
ing chopped mushrooms or truffles. 

SWEET BREADS. 

Boil ten minutes to blanch, then throw them into cold 
water, skim and lard them ; roll in grated bread crumbs, 
pepper and salt, and cook in boiling lard till quite tender ; 
lay them in a dish and pour over the following gravy : a 
cup of hot water, a large wineglass of sherry, a little nut- 
meg and lemon juice, and thicken with a tablespoonful of 
flour. 

TO ROAST A TURKEY. 

Wash the turkey nicely ; prepare the stuffing with bread 
crumbs, sweet herbs, lemon peel, nutmeg, pepper, salt, and 



-ii^^MEATS. 



BROILED VENISON. 

Cut the slices medium size; thickly hutter them, sprinkle 
with black pepper and a little salt, place the slices on a 
gridiron and broil them in a hurry. In this way you will 
preserve the flavor of the venison without drying, which is 
frequently done by allowing the meat to remain too long on 
the fire ; send it to the table very hot, with a h'ttle melted 
butter over it. This is a palatable dish for breakfast or tea. 
Mutton or veal dressed in the same way is very nice. 

^ STEWED VENISON. 

Have the chafing dish ready ; the slices of venison nicely 
cut, proper thickness, and between the slices, as you place 
them in the dish, put bits of good butter, pepper, mustard, 
salt, a little cayenne pepper and claret wine ; let it stew 10 
or 15 minutes. Mutton or cold roast beef cooked in this 
way is very nice. Put sufficient currant je^ly to make it 
palatably sweet. 

VENISON STEAK. 

This is a delicious appetizer for breakfast. Cook it as 
beefsteak, washing it nicely, draining the water from it ; 
butter it very thoroughly, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and 
cook it in a hurry ; serve it very hot. 

VENISON (THE HAUNCH). 

Venison should always hang a considerable length of 
time ; the delicacy of its flavor is obtained by hanging only. 
If it be cooked while fresh it will not equal, in any respect, a 
haunch of mutton. The haunch of venison when about to be 
roasted, should be washed in warm milk and water, and 
dried with a clean cloth ; if it has hung very long, and the 
skin smells musty, it will be the safest plan to remove the

brown ; then put them in a stewpan with gravy sufficient 
to cover them ; 2 spoonfuls of lemon pickle or anchovy, a 
quarter of a lemon sliced, and a sprig of sweet marjoram ; 
cover them closely, and stew them for about J hour. If 
necessary, thicken the gravy. 

BROWN PRICASEE. 

The beef or veal is to be chopped very fine ; take out all 
the stringy parts ; season it with pepper, salt and a little 
ginger; beat up 4 eggs very light; a large plateful of stale 
bread ; make them in balls ; roll them in flour and fry them ; 
then take 2 tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed with cold water ; 
put some seasohing and hot water into the frying pan ; after 
it has boiled throw it over the balls and let it stew about 15 
minutes before dishing them in tomato or walnut catsup. 
To the 4 eggs, take 3 lbs. of veal and full i of bread. 

STEWED DUCKS. 

Truss the ducks and stuff them with bread, butter and 
onions : place then with lard in a frying pan ; have prepared 
in an iron pot slips of bacon, giblets, water, pepper, salt, a 
little mace or cloves, if you like it ; put in the ducks and let 
them stew gently, but constantly, for 2 hours; then add 
lemon juice or lemon pickle. Flour the ducks each time 
that you turn them in the pot. Thicken with butter rolled 
in flour. This receipt is for large ducks ; those not grown 
require less time. 

STEWED PIGEONS. 

Season the pigeons with salt, pepper, cloves, mace and 
sweet herbs ; wrap this seasoning up in a piece of butter and 
put in and stuff them ; tie up the neck and vent, and half 
roast them ; then put them in the saucepan, with 1 quart 
of good gravy, a little white wine, some picked mushrooms, 
pepper corns, a slice of onion, and some pickled oysters ; 
stew all together till sufficiently done; then thicken it with 
butter and the yolk of Jl egg ; garnish with lemons.

STEWED RA^iBITS OR DUCKS. 

Take 2 rabbits, put 2 or 3 onions, 1 bunch of parsley, in 
^ith them, and half boil them and cut them in pieces/as for 
a fricasee ; take the onions, parsley and the liver, cut it 
small ; take 6 spoonfulsof claret wine, 3 of vinegar, and dis- 
solve 2 or 3 anchovies into it ; put all this in the stewpan 
with i lb. of fresh butter worked up with flour ; thicken it 
and serve it up. Ducks done in the same way are very 
nice. 

DUCKS A LA MODE. 

Take 2 fine ducks, cut them into quarters, fry them in 
butter a little brown ; pour ofl all the fat and throw a little 
flour over them ; add ^ pint of good gravy, i of a pint of 
red wine, 2 eschallots, 1 anchovy and a few sweet herbs ; cover 
them close ; let them stew 15 minutes ; take out the herbs ; 
skim ofl the grease and let the sauce be as thick as cream ; 
send it to table ; garnish it with lemon. 

ROAST DUCKS. 

Ducks should be well plucked without tearing the skin, 
all the plugs being removed, clean the inside thoroughly 
with a little warm water, and stuS them with bread and 
butter, onion, sage, pepper and salt ; roast them before a 
brisk fire, but not too close ; baste very frequently ; they 
will take from i hou.r to 1 hour, much depends on the age 
and size ; when the breast plumps, they will be done ; serve 
them with a rich brown gravy. 

BOILED DUCKS. ^ 

Clean and pluck them, let the skin be preserved from 
rents ; salt tbem for 30 hours previous to cooking ; flour a 
clean white cloth and boil them in it. A moderate sized 
^uck will take about 1 hour's boiling ; make a rich onion 
sauce with milk, and send it to table with the duck. When 
the duck is boiled fresh it may be st^fied as for roasting 
and served with the same description of gravy.

TO HASH DUCKS. 

The same receipt may be followed as for hashing fowl 
and game, with the exception that it will not require as 
much time to stew. 

TO STEW DUCKS. 

There is a difference between a stewed duck and stewed 
duck, and it is not the a alone ; in the one case the duck is 
stewed whole, and in the other in pieces. To stew a duck, 
or ducks, they should be roasted for 20 minutes, and then 
placed in a stewpan with an onion, cut in slices, a little 
sage and mint and sweet herbs chopped fine, and about a 
pint of good beef gravy, seasoned with pepper and salt ; let 
it stew gently for 20 minutes ; take out the duck carefully 
and keep it warm ; strain the gravy ; pour it into a clean 
stewpan, and add to it, when well heated, the duck and a 
quart of green peas; let it simmer for a half hour ; then add 
a little flour and^ butter, a glass of port wine, and send to 
table, with the peas in the same dish as the* duck. 

STEWED DUCK. 

The ducks should be cut into joints and laid into a stew- 
pan with a pint of good gravy ; let it come to a boil ; as the 
scum rises, remove it; season with salt and cayenne; let it 
stew gently three-quarters of an hour : mix smoothly 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of fine ground rice with a glass of port wine ; stir 
it into the gravy ; let it have 7 or 8 minutes to amalgamate 
with the gravy ; dish and send it to table very hot. 

BATTERED CHICKEN. 

Make a light batter with 3 eggs, a small tablespoonful of 
butter, a little wheat flour, and salt to the taste ; joint the 
chicken, and put them into the batter ; grease the frying 
pan, throw the mixture of chicken and batter into it and 
fry a good brown. This quantity of batter will suffice for 
one pair of chickens.

CREOLE COOKEBY BOOK. 39 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Having cut up a pair of young chickens, lay them in a 
pan of cold water to extract the blood ; wipe them dry ; sea- 
son with pepper and salt, dredge them with flour, and fry 
them in lard ; both sides should be of a rich brown ; take 
them out of the pan and keep them near the fire ; skim care- 
fully the gravy in which the chickens have been fried, mix 
it with i pint of cream ; season with a little mace, pepper and 
salt, adding some parsley. 

TO MAKE A FRENCH PILAU. 

Boil a pair of fowls ; when done, take them out and put 
the rice in the same water, first taking out some of the 
liquor ; when the rice is done, butter it well, cover the bot- 
tom of the dish with ^ of it, then put the fowls on it and 
add the remainder of the liquor ; cover the fowls with the 
other i of the rice, make it smooth, and spread over it 
the yolks of 2 eggs, well beaten ; bake in a moderate oven. 

POULET A LA EUGENIE. 

Prepare 1 or 2 chickens for boiling ; cover well with water 
and put in a small piece of pork ; boil until the chicken falls 
from the bone ; select the white meat, and mince or mash 
in a mortar until it becomes paste; put in a skillet; place 
this where it will keep warm, and add nearly as much but- 
ter as you have chicken, a little salt, pepper, mace and 
celery seed, if you choose ; boil a small, delicate onion, 
chopped fine ; and mix through it when simmered ; let itbe- 
come quite firm and cold before pressing into jelly jars ; it 
will keep some days in a cool place, and is a good relish for 
lunch or tea. 

WHITE PRICASEE OP CHICKEN. 

Cut a pair of chickens, wash the pieces through 2 or 3 
waters ; lay them in a large pan ; sprinkle slightly with salt 
and fill the pan with boiling water; cover and let the 



60 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

pan a few bits of fresh butter, rolled in flour. Then put in 
the meat, and sprinkle a little pepper over each piece. 
Have ready a quart of large, fresh oysters ; strain the liquor 
to clear it from bits of the shell, and pour it over the meat 
in the stewpan. Stew the meat in the oyster liquor till it is 
thoroughly cooked, skimming it well, and keeping it covered, 
except when skimming. Then add grated nutmeg and a 
few blades of mace. Lastly, put in the oysters and let 
them remain in just long enough to plump, which will be in 
a few minutes. When all is done, serve up the whole in one 
dish, and send very hot to the table. 

IRISH STEW. 

Cut a square, thick piece of beef from the round or sir- 
loin, and trim oflf the fat. Put it into a stewpan with 
water enough to cover it, and season it slightly with salt 
and pepper; let it stew slowly till tender all through ; then 
add potatoes, being first pared and cut into quarters. 

STEWED SMOKED BEEF. 

Chip it very thin ; put it into a skillet, with fresh butter, 
pepper, and 2 or 3 beaten yolks of eggs. Let it stew till the 
beef is crisp and curled up. 

BEEF PATTIES. 

A nice way of disposing of underdone roast beef is to 
mince all the lean, and a very little of the fat ; season it with 
cayenne and powdered nutmeg, or mace, or else chopped 
sweet herbs ; if you have a fancy for mushroom gravy, 
moisten the meat with that ; make a nice paste and cut it 
into small circular sheets, rolled out not very thin ; covH 
i of each sheet of paste with the minced beef (not too near 
the edge), and fold over the other i so as to form a half- 
moon ; then crimp them with a sharp knife ; lay the patties 
in square baking pans, prick them with a fork and bake 
them brown. Cold veal minced with cold ham or tongue. 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 51 

makes very nice patties, also cold chicken or turkey made 
in balls, and fried in lard. 

POTATO BEEF. 

Boil some potatoes till well done all through; peel them, 
put them into a large pan, and mash them smoothly, add- 
ing, as you proceed, some milk and 1 or more beaten eggs, 
well mixed, to the potatoes ; rub the bottom of a white 
pudding dish with nice butter, or some drippings of cold 
beef, and cover it with a thick layer of mashed potatoes ; 
next, put in thin slices of b^f (without the fat), enough to 
cover the potatoes ; then a layer of mashed potatoes, then 
beef, then potatoes, till the dish is full, heaping them up in 
the centre ; bake it in an oven. 

COLD BRISKET OF BEEF. 

Cut brisket from the bones, wash and lay in a large dish ; 
cover well with salt, pepper and a little saltpetre ; then cover 
to stand several days, as the weather will permit ; next, wipe 
ofi the dressing, place on a clean dish, powder mace and 
cloves, and allspice together, and spread thickly over the 
beef; then roll it over and over and tie up well; lastly, sew 
up tightly in a cloth and boil slowly all day ; serve cold. 

SPICED BEEF. 

A round of beef of 10 pounds, 1 teaspoonful of saltpetre, 
1 tablespoonful of brown sugar to stand in it about 2 days, 
then rub in a slop-bowl full of salt, and let stand 10 days, 
turning it every day ; sprinkle over about a spoonful of all- 
spice ; cut salt pork in strips size of your finger, and have 
them well dipped in ground allspice ; gash the beef with a 
kmife and stuff in thick as you please on both sides ; put in a 
large kettle, cover well with water and the juices from the 
meat ; boil slowly about 6 hours, when cold turn and trim. 

VEAL PAT£, TO SERVE COLD. • 

8 pounds of veal cutlets, chopped fine, with a good slice 
of salt pork, 2 eggs, broken in, after meat is well mixed, 6 



52 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

crackers, (powdered fine), butter to size of a hen's egg, 
rubbed in a tablespoonful of salt, cayenne pepper, and sweet 
herbs to your taste ; mix the whole thoroughly ; make up 
like a loaf of bread ; smooth over the top with butter melt- 
ed in water, and bake in a moderate oven ; when cold, cut 
in thin slices and serve. 

PRESSED BEEP. 

Salt a brisket of beef with salt and saltpetre, 5 days, then 
boil it gently till extremely tender ; put it under a large 
weight, or in a cheese press, till perfectly cold. It is very 
nice for sandwiches. 

COLD JELLY DAUBE. 

Four lbs. round of beef; season well with salt, pep- 
per, a little garlic, 1 bay leaf, and 1 clove. Lard well through 
and through ; sprinkle with a tablespoonful of vinegar, and 
let it stand for 24 hours. Put the daube in a pot with a 
small piece of lard ; cover with heavy cover on a slow fire, 
and let it smother for about 4 hours, until thoroughly done ; 
then take ofi the cover, let it fry a light brown, then re- 
move from the fire. In a separate pot, have 3 pigs feet and 
8 calves feet boiling steadily till they leave the bone ; (to 
be skimmed well at the first boil) ; add one carrot to boil 
about i hour, ,then slice in length and place at bottom 
of bowl when the daube is to be served. Break 2 eggs, 
whites and shells to be beaten together and boiled with jelly 
briskly, then strain through thick flannel or cloth. Mix 
the daube gravy with jelly ; let it rest about ^ an hour, then 
pour slowly over the daube. Set it in a cold place, and when 
cold, take the lard from the top with a spoon, and withtl 
tound edge knife detach carefully the daube and turn into 
a round plate. To avoid breaking the jelly, place the plate 
on top of the bowl and turn it over. 

KAVIOLfi A LA AVEQNO. 
Four lbs. round of beef to be larded, pfut in a pot with a 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 58 

tablespoonful of lard; smother on a slow fire; when ready 
to fry, sprinkle with a little flour; fry brown; add onions, 
salt, and pepper to taste, and water enough to cook thor* 
oughly ; about ^ an hour before done, put in i pound of dry 
mushrooms. This daube is made for its gravy to the 
ravioles. \ 

FARE OR STUFFING. 

Boil 2 bunches of spinach, chop fine with the white meat 
of a roast or boiled chicken; add 1 calf's brain, previously 

• 

boiled and cleaned ; stir the whole well in b, bowl with 6 
raw eggs, i bottle of sweet oil, and season with salt and 
pepper to taste ; now take a pint of flour, add 2 eggs, with a 
little water, making the paste as stifi as possible; roll out 
flat and thin, put in 4 layer of the stuffing all the length of 
the paste ; double the paste over and cut lengthways with 
a paste wheel, and also cut crossways, making small squares ; 
put squares of paste in a pot of boiling water, and boil 
steadily for ^ hour ; strain and put 1 layer of squares in 
bottom of deep dish ; sprinkle grated parmesan chgese ; pour 
some of the daube gravy with mushrooms, previously made 
thin, another layer of squares, cheese and gravy, and so on ; 
serve hot. 

CROQUETS OF COLD MEAT. 

You may take any kind of boiled or roasted meat and 
mix them together, so that it is clear of bones ; make a hash 
of ij;, and mix it with a piquante sauce ; the mixture must 
be very thick ; if it be too thin, put a little bread with it 5 
add capers, mushrooms, salt, spices and fine herbs, boiled 
together ; let it get cold on a chopping board or dish ; make 
balls of it and press them flat ; roll them in egg and grated 
bread, and fry them in butter, brown on both sides. 

TO MAKE SWEET BREADS. 

Take 1 lb. of raw veal, aad shred it very fine ; add i 
lb. of marrow or beef suet, and season it with pepper and 



54 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

salt; beat it very fine in a marble mortar, and make il 
the shape of sweet breads ; beat well the yolk of an egg and 
dip these into it ; fry them in a good deal of butter, and lay 
crumbs of bread between them ; pour a little melted butter 
on them. Some put in the white of an egg, also, which 
makes them lighter. They must not be fried of a dark 
color. 

PRIED LAMB. 

Cut a loin of lamb into thin slices, beat them and lay 
them in water to take out the blood ; then fry them in but- 
ter ; make the- sauce with butter, anchovies and lemon. 

VEAL OLIVES. 

Slice pieces of the fillet of veal ^ an inch thick and 8 or 
10 inches wide and long ; put them in a dish ; sprinkle over 
them on 1 side, a little pepper, salt and mace, all finely 
pounded ; roll tightly and tie them up separately ; put them 
into a stewpan with a little water and butter, and simmer 
down to a brown gravy; when they are to be served, have 
ready sonSe pounded biscuit or bread crumbs, which sprin- 
kle oyer them after they are put into the dish ; stew them 1 
hour. Beef may be prepared in the same way. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Rub well on both sides of the round with 1 ounce of salt- 
petre, then rub in one pound of brown sugar, after which, 
rub all with salt, into which you will mix a tablespoonful 
of allspice, 2 of black pepper, 2 teaspoonfuls of cloves and 
^ 1 of mace; let it stand 30 days, turning it every other day, 
and bathing it with the liquor that runs from it. 

CORN BEEF. 

For rounds.it is only necessary to rub them first with 
saltpetre and then with common salt; they will make their 
own brine, in which they should be turned every day ; this 
will answer for all beef that is to be quickly used ; a round 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 56 

of small beef only requires ten days in winter ; it grows hard 
if kept longer ; in warm weather less time suffices. 

TO PICKLE TONGUES. . 

Take a beefs tongue, rub it with 1 pound of white salt, 1 
ounce of saltpetre, i pound of coarse salt ; rub it well and 
turn it every day in the pickle for 2 weeks ; this pickle will 
do several tongues, only adding a little more white salt. 

BOILED BEEP. 

To have it very tender it should \>e boiled slowly, and the 
pot well skimmed ; the meat should be well covered with 
water, so that the skim may be removed easily ; when beef 
is very salt it should boil J of an hour ; then take it up, throw 
away the water it has boiled in, fill up the pot with fresh 
^ater, replace the beef and let it boil gently for 3 hours ; 
the round is the most choice piece to boil, next, the H bone. 
Observe to take ofi all the scum as it rises. 

A LA MODE BEEF. « 

A round of fresh beef weighing from 18 to 20 lbs,, 1 
lb. of the fat of bacon or corned pork, the marrow from 
the bone of the beef, a i lb. of beef suet, chopped to- 
gether, 2 bundles of herbs, parsley, thyme, small onions, 
etc., chopped fine, 2 large bunches of sweet Aiarjoram, 2 
bunches of sweet basil, 2 large nutmegs, J ounce of cloves 
beaten to a powder, ^ ounce of mace, 1 tablespoon- 
ful of salt, 2 glasses of Madeira wine. If the a la mode 
beef is to be eaten cold, prepare it 3 days before it is wanted. 
Take out the bone, fasten up the opening with skewers, and 
tie the meat all round with tape; rub it all over on both 
sides with salt ; (a large round of beef will be more tender 
than a small one) ; chop the marrow and suet together ; 
pound the spice ; chop the herbs very fine ; pick the pot 
marjoram and sweet basil clean froni the stalks, and rub the 
leaves to a powder, making 4 tablespoo&fuls of each ; add 
the pepper and salt, and mix all together — all the ingredient^

56 CBEOLB COOKERY BOOK. 

that compose the seasoning ; cut the fat of the bacon into 
pieces 2 inches long, with a sharp knife make deep incisions 
all over the round of beef and very near each other, put a 
little of the seasoning into each hole and a slip of bacon 
pressed down hard, covered with more seasoning, with a 
little wine^n each hole ; stufi both sides alike, put it in a 
deep baking dish, pour over it some wine, cover it, and let 
it stand till next morning ; next day put a little water in 
the dish, set it in a covered oven, and bake or stew it for 
12 hours, at least ; let it remain all night in the oven, and it 
must be eaten hot at dinner the next day ; when cold, 
ornament with parsley. 

A COLD DISH FOR LUNCH. 

Cut a hard boiled egg in thin slices, and place it in the 
middle of a bowl ; put a layer of raw veal cut in thin slices, 
and sprinkled with a mixture of pepper, salt and herbs 
(such as parsley, thyme and sage). Place next very thin 
riices of bacon, and continue to put alternate layers of veal, 
seasoned with a little mace and of bacon, until the bowl is 
filled. Mash it down and tie a floured cloth over it very 
tight. Turn it down in a pot of hot water, and let it boil 2 
hours. It is eaten cold. 

HAM TOAST. 

Grate some lean ham ; mix with it the yolk of an egg, 
pepper it, and fry it in butter ; pour on square bits of toast, 
and brown it with a salamander. 

BOUILLfi. 

After boiling the bouille in the soup, take it out, and 
make a sauce of flour and butter, and add either capers or 
J)arsley, as you prefer. 

BEEP BALLS. 

• Mince' very fine a piece of tender beef, fat and lean ; mince 
also an onion, with some boiled parsley ; add grated crumbs 






CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 57 

of bread, and season with pepper, salt, and nutmeg ; mix 
the whole together ; moisten with a beaten egg, roil it into 
balls, flour, and /ry them. 

BEEFSTEAK PIE. 

Butter a deep dish, spread a thin paste over the bottom, 
sides and edges. Cut away from the beef all the bone, fat 
and gristle ; ciit the beef in thin pieces the size of the palm 
of your hand ; beat it well with a rollingpin ; put a layer 
of the beef, seasoned with pepper, salt, nutmeg, allspice, a 
little catsup and onion. Slice boiled Irish potatoes, and 
put a layer on the meat until the dish is filled ; pour in a 
little water and butter. Bake 1 hour. 

SPICED, OR SMOKED BEEP. 

The most choice part for this purpose is the round. 
Wash the meat and- dry well with a cloth. Grind to pow- 
der an equal quantity of cloves and mace, and having mixed 
them together, rub them well into the beef with your hand. 
The spice will be found a great improvement, both to the 
taste and smell of the meat. To 50 lbs. of meat allow 3 lbs. 
of fine salt, 1^ ounces of saltpetre, 2 lbs. of good brown 
sugar, and 2 quarts of molasses ; mix these well together, 
boil and skim it for 20 minutes, and when no more scum 
rises, take it from the fire. Have the beef ready in a tub or 
barrel ; pour the brine upon it ; cover well with a thick cloth, 
looking at it frequently, and skimming off whatever may 
be floating on the top. Keep the beef in this pickle about 
2 weeks, when it may be used as spiced beef. Take the meat 
from the pickle at the expiration of the above mentioned 
time ; hang in a hogshead or smokehouse, and with a con- 
stant smoking for 6 days, yotl will have something nice. 

TO STEW BEEP. 

Wash the beef, rub salt over it, and put it in a pot, and 
just cover it with water, set it over a slow fire, and after it

has stewed an hour, put in some potatoes, pared and cut in 
half, and some parsnips, scraped and split ; let them stew 
with the beef till quite tender. Turn the meat several times 
in the pot. When all is done, serve up the meat and vege- 
tables together, and the gravy in a boat, having first skim- 
med it. 

TO PICKLE BEEP. 

Salt the beef with the usual quantity of saltpetre and 
salt, and let it remain 2 days in the tub to drain off the 
bloody brine. Then put a brine made as follows : To 20 
quarts of cold water, made salty enough to bear an egg, with 
common salt, put 3 lbs. of brown sugar, | to 1 lb. of salt- 
petre, and 2 lbs. alum salt ; spice them well together, and 
put in the beef; let it remain 4 or 5 weeks, accordfiig to 
size. Then hang it up to dry in .^ cool place, frequently 
rubbing it with wheat bran. It is then ready to ^moke. 
Or you may head it in small barrels, where it will keep any 
length of time, if covered with brine, and kept close from 
the air. The latter way is preferable, as the meat is more 
juicy, and not exposed to the bug or worm, to which it is 
always liable if the fly can approach it. To guard it, a tub 
in which beef is salted, should always be covered with a 
coarse cloth tied closely around it. 

BEEP HAM. 

Rub a little common salt over a piece of beef of 20 lbs. 
weight ; take out the bone, and in 1 or 2 days, rub well into 
the beef the following ingredients : 2 ounces of saltpetre, 4 
ounces of brown sugar, 6 ounces of bag salt, 1 ounce of 
white pepper, 1 of cloves and nutmeg ; strew over it \ lb. 
of common salt ; let it remain 16 days, turning it daily ; it 
is then hung up, or boiled, and allowed to stand till cold in 
the water in which it was boiled. 

RONPOLK CURED HAMS. 
To each ham, or piece of meat, use 1 tablespoonful of 



^ 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 59 

saltpetre ; rub it in thoroughly. Then rub with the com- 
mon salt, in which pack it away ; letting it remain for 6 
weeks. Then take it out and wipe it very dry with a coarse 
towel, and rub the thick part and bone with black pepper ; 
and smoke it for 6 or 8 weeks. 

TO CURE BACON. 

To every bushel of salt add 1 lb. of saltpetre, 1 lb. of 
brown sugar, and 2 ounces of common red pepper, coarsely 
beaten ; this is a sufficient quantity for every 100 lbs. of 
meat, and in rubbing over the hams and shoulders, have 
mixed an additional quantity of saltpetre and pepper (say 
a handful of each), to stufi around the hocks. The meat 
must be very well rubbed with something harder than the 
hand ; and in packing it away, must be completely covered 
with the former preparation. Let the hams remain in salt 
4 weeks, the jowls and shoulders 3, and the middlings a fort- 
night. When they are ready to hang up, have them washed, 
and the hams and shoulders hung by the large end ; the 
next day begin to smoke them, and make 1 good smoke 
every day, until the weather becomes mild, or about the last 
of March ; afterwards it must be occasionally examined, 
and the most indifierent used first. 

TO CURE BEEF. 

To 10 gaUons of water, add 10 quarts of salt, 1 lb. of 
brown sugar, and 1 of saltpetre; boil it until the froth is 
done rising, then take it ofi, and let it remain to get quite 
cold ; pack the beef down close in a barrel, and cover it 
with brine, weight it down with rocks, but it must not be 
covered. This quantity of brine is sufficient for 1 quarter 
of beef. 

FILLET DE BCEUF. 

Remove, with a sharp bladed knife, every particle of the 
sinewy skin which covers the fillet, then lard it if you 
choose, (a thing the French never omit, though otners gen-

erally dislike the mixture of pork and beef) ; place in an ob- 
long tin pan, well buttered, lay the trimmings all around, 
with 2 bay leaves, 3 carrots, a little celery, faggot of pars- 
ley, a little thyme, 2 blades of mace, a couple of onions, 
with 2 cloves stuck in each, and 2 green ones, or eschallots ; 
moisten with a \ pint of broth, and a ^ bottle of wine 
(white), cover the whole with a piece of buttered paper, set 
in oven, and let it braize gently, moistening frequently with 
its own liquor, for about | of an hour, then strain the gravy ; 
have ready a nice brown sauce, into which you have cut 
some truffles and mushrooms, and put a wineglass of ma- 
deira ; add the strained gravy, place the fillet on a dish, pour 
the sauce nicely all around, and serve. — N. B : A pound and 
a half of nice fillet makes a very nice family dish, if cut 
into small steaks, simply broiled, and placed in straight 
lines on dish, with this same sauce, made of the trimmings, 
poured around. 

MINCED MEAT. 

Take cold boiled beef, removing all bones and gristle, 
with a good proportion of cold boiled potatoes ; chop them 
middling fine ; fry 3 slices of salt pork in a spider ; when 
the pork is brown, take it up, and put in the minced meat 
and potatoes. Let it cook 20 minutes. Take it up in a 
covered dish, with the slices of pork placed on the top of 
the dish. 

CURING HAMS. 

To each green ham of 18 lbs. 1 dessertspoonful of salt- 
petre and i pound of brown sugar, applied to the fleshy side 
of the ham and about the hock ; cover the fleshy side with 
fine salt \ inch thick and pack away in tubs, to remain 
from 3 to 6 weeks, according to size ; before smoking, rub 
ofl all the salt from the ham, and cover well with ground 
black pepper, particularly about the bone and hock ; hang 
up and drain for 2 weeks ; smoke with green wood 8 weeks, 
till the rind is brown.

APPLE PORK. 

This preparation of apples for fresh pork is a great im- 
provement. Take a fillet of pork, rub it over with a little 
salt and pepper ; score the outside skin ; take out the bone, 
and fill it with nice stewed apples, free of paring and cores, 
nicely seasoned with nutmeg and sugar, with bits of the 
rind of a lemon ; then have ready some 2 dozen apples, par- 
ed, cored and cut in slices or quarters, sweetened well with 
sugar, and flavored with lemon (a little of the juice added 
will be an improvement) ; put the pork into a large pot or 
iron bake oven ; fill up with the cut apples the space all 
around, adding just sufficient water to keep it from burning ; 
stew or bake it for 3 hours ; when done, serve it on a clean 
dish and send it very hot to the table. 

HOW TO BOIL HAM. 

A ham, if dry, should be soaked 12 hours in warm water ; 
then put it on in cold water, and let it simmer and boil 5 or 
6 hours, according to size. 

PICKLED BEEF. 

Sprinkle the beef with salt and let it steam 24 hours, 
where the bloody brine can run ofi ; then pack into a barrel 
and cover with a pickle made as fqllows : to 16 gallons 
water, add 24 lbs. salt, 6 lbs. brown sugar, and 8 ounces 
saltpetre ; let it stand till cold, then pour over ; every 4 or 5 
minutes boil over again and add a little of each ingredient.

chop the meat fine ; season with butter, pepper and salt ; 
pour in enough of the liquid, the chicken was boiled in, to 
make it moist ; simmer for a few moments ; then put it in a 
mould to cool. It is excellent when sliced nicely. 



VEGETABLES. 



As a general rule, add a little salt to the water in which 
you cook the vegetables, with the exception of dried beans 
and peas. 

BOILED POTATOES. 
The easiest way to cook potatoes is to put them in just 
water enough to cover thpra, with the skins on, and to boil 
them con3tantly till done, then squeeze them in a dry cloth 
and send tjiem to tlie. table very hot. Potatoes should not 
remain soaking in the water without boiling, if you wish 
them mealy. (Irish.) 

IRISH POTATO SNOW BALLS. 
After boiled tender, drain off the water, and let the 
potatoes steam till they break to pieces ; then mix them 
with the yolk of an egg, a small piece of butter, bread 
crumbs, with salt to the taste ; fry them in good lard, (after 
forming them into balls) or brown them in an oven. 

ROAST POTATOES. 

Take potatoes of the same size, wash and dry them, put 
them in the oven of the stove or some convenient toaster ; do 
not burn the outside before they are warmed through ; roast 
large ones about 2 hours. They will roast quicker, if first 
parboiled. 

BAKED IRISH POTATOES. 
Boil soft 8 good sized Irish potatoes ; naash them, and add 
2 tablespoonfuls of butter, while hot ; mix with it 1 pint of 
milk, add salt ; put in a dish and bake i hour. 

POTATOES IN CREAM. 
Put into a stewpan a good sized piece of butter, a dessert- 
spoonful of flour, some salt, pepper and parsley, (chopped) 



..i.JL 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 65 

to whicli add ^ pint of cream ; put this sauce on the fire, stit 
it till it boils, slice the potatoes and throw into the sauce. 

POTATO SNOW. 

Use potatoes that are white, mealy and smooth ; boil them 

carefully, and when done, peel them, pour off the Water and 

set them on a trivet before the fire until they are quite dry 

and powdery ; then rub them through a coarse wire sieve into 

, the dish on which they are to go to table. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

Wash them, but do not pare them ; put them in a pot 
with water enough to cover them an inch, and do not put 
on the lid ; when the water is near boiling, pour it off and 
replace it with cold water, with a good portion of salt. The 
cold water sends the heat from the surface to the h^art, and 
makes the potato mealy. Potatoes of a moderate size re* 
quire J hour's boiling ; large ones 1 hour; try them with a 
fork. When done pour off the water, cover the pot with a 
folded napkin and let them stand by the fire about i hour 
to dry. Potatoes served with the skins on have a negligee 
appearance for the table. 

FRIED POTATOES. 

Use cold potat<^es that have been boiled, mash them, make 
them into flat cakes, and fry them in butter. Very nice for 
breakfast. 

POTATO BALLS, 

Mix mashed potatoes with the yolk of an egg, roll them 
into balls in a little flour, with egg and bread crumbs ; fry 
them in very nice lard, or brown them in a hot oven. 

POTATOES WITH THICK BATTER.

salt, nutmeg and pepper. (You may also mix fine chopped 
parsley with it). German receipt. 

FRIED i;rish potatoes. 

Boil the potatoes, peel and mash them into small cakes, 
fry them in lard, of a rich brown on both sides. 

IRISH POTATOES MASHED. 

Boil the potatoes and mash them in a mortar with but- 
ter ; to a tablespoonful of butter use 8 or 10 common sized 
potatoes ; salt to the taste. 

POTATO BALLS FOR BREAKFAST. 

Pare and boil dry the potatoes as directed, then put them 
into a hot pan and mash with a lump of butter and a little 
salt ; beajb this well and make it into little cakes or roll it 
into balls and dip them into egg, and sprinkle with bread 
crumbs ; fry a nice brown. 

SWEET POTATOES. 

Among the various ways of dressing sweet potatoes, that 
which appears most popular is to bake them twice. You 
may put 2 or 3 platefuls at once into the oven ; bake them 
till soft ; peel and put them on a tin sheet, and bake them 
again for \ an hour ; serve them up hot. 

FRIED SWEET POTATOES. 

Sweet potatoes may be dressed, either cut in long slices and 
fried in lard, or half boiled, peeled, cut round, and fried 
quickly. In the latter case they must be drained, and served 
up as dry as possible. 

GREBN PEAS. 

Put the peas in a covered vessel with a little salt ; place 
this in another vessel filled with water, which must be boiled 
until the peas are tender.

GREEN PEAS A LA BOURGEOISE. 

Wash li pints of green peas, put them into a stewpan, 
with fresh butter, parsley, lettuce cut in fours, and a little 
sugar. Let these boil in their own juice over a slow fire.

made of the yolk of 2 eggs and a little cream ; let the whole 
remain a few minutes on the fire. 

GREEN PEAS, 

Green peas should be young and freshly shelled ; wash them 
clean; put them in a bag and the bag into plenty of boiling 
water, with a little salt and a teaspoonful of pounded loaf 
sugar; boil them till tender. It takes from |- to 1 hour 
to boil them. Never let them stand in the water after they 
are done. Season them with butter, salt and pepper. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Boil good Irish potatoes very dry ; let them cool thorough- 
ly ; slice and pour a dressing over them, made of the yolks 
of 3 eggs, oil, vinegar, pepper, salt and parsley. 

JUMBALLAYA. 

A SPANISH CREOLE DISH. 

Wash 1 lb. of rice, and soak it an hour ; cut up a cold 
roast chicken or the remnants of a turkey and a slice of 
ham, which fry in a tablespoonful of lard ; stir in the rice, 
and add slowly, while stirring in a pint of hot water ; cover 
your pot, and set where it can cook slowly. Jumballaya is 
very nice made with oysters or shrimp. 

ON COOKING TOMATOES. 

The art of cooking tomatoes lies mostly in cooking them 
enough ; in whatever way prepared, they should be put on 
some hours before dinner! This vegetable is good in all 
soups and stews, where such a decided flavoring is wanted. 



68 CREOLE COOKEBY BOOK. 

TO KEEP TOMATOES 

THE WHOLE YEAR. 

Take the tomatoes, when perfectly ripe, and scald them in 
hot wiater, in order to take ofi the skin easily. When 
skinned, boil them well in a little sugar or salt, but no 
water. Then spread them in cakes about an inch thick, and 
place the cakes in the sun ; they will be ready in 3 or 4 days 
to pack away in bags, which should be hung*in a dry place. 

TOMATO OMELETTE. 

Parboil 2 onions ; while this is doing, peel a sufficient 
quantity of tomatoes to make 3 pints when cooked (this is 
easily done when hot water has been poured over them) ; cut 
them up, and add the onions, also 1^ teaspoonfulsof crumbs 
of bread, 1 tablespoonful of salt, 1 heaping teaspoonful of 
black pepper, and 4 tablespoonfuls of butter ; beat these 
^ thoroughly together and set them over a slow fire, gradually 
to stew ; they should cook never less than 3 hours, but the 
longer the better ; about 15 minutes before they are to be 
served up, beat 6 eggs,^and stir them in ; put them on a hot 
fire, and let them boil, stirring them all the time. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 
Peel the tomatoes, cut them in half* And squeeze out the 
seeds ; then put them into a stewpan, without any water ; 
add to them salt and cayenne pepper to your taste, 1 tea- 
spoonful of brown sugar, some grated bread, or cracker, 
butter and mace (powdered) ; stew them slowly, till perfect- 
ly done ; send them to table very hot. — A very nice append- 
age to beefsteak, and other tasteless dishes. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Take 12 large tomatoes and take out as much of the pulp 
and seed as you can with convenience scoop out, without 
injuring the form ; chop up the pulp, and add to it salt, 
pepper, thyme, to the taste, with 1 tablespoonful of butter ; 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 69 

form this into a stuffing with crumbs of bread, and put back 
into the skins, bake them in a pan very nicely in a moderate 
oven. 

TOMATO OMELET. 

Select 1 quart of fine, ripe tomatoes, pour over them boil- 
ing water to remove the skin, then chop them finely, put 
them into a saucepan without any water ; chop 2 onions very 
finely, cover closely, and let them simmer slowly, an hour; 
then add a little salt and cayenne pepper, a large spoonful of 
bread crumbs, and cover tightly ; beat up 5 eggs to a stifi 
froth ; have ready a heated pan, and a small piece of butter 
and grease it; stir the eggs into the tomatoes; mix all 
together, and pour it into the pan ; brown it on one side, fold 
it over, and serve up on a hot dish. 

TO BAKE TOMATOES. 

Scald and peel about a dozen or more fine, ripe tomatoes, 
butter a shallow baking dish, and put in the finest, without 
breaking them, and not quite touching; fill up the space 
between with stale bread, buttered ; the rest of the tomatoes 
mash, and strain out all the hard parts ; then mix with a 
spoonful of butter, pepper and salt ; pour it over the dish ; 
strew bread crumbs on the top ; bake about ^ hour ; sprinkle 
sugar between each layer of tomatoes. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

Boil 1 quart milk ; thicken with 1 tablespoonful flour { 
season with salt, pepper and a little butter ; stew 1 dozen 
fine tomatoes; drain partially, strain through cullender, 
pour the boiling milk to it ; boil up once, and serve. 

PRIED TOMATOES. 

Peel 1 dozen ripe tomatoes, and fry them in a little fresh 
butter, together with 2 or 3 sliced green peppers ; sprinkle on 
them a little salt, then add 1 or 2 onions sliced, and let the

TO PREPARE AND BOIL RICE. 

Wash and pick 1 pint of rice ; add to it 3 pints of water, 
and 1 tablespoonful of salt; boil over a quick fire for 
10 minutes, stirring occasionally; then pour off all, or 
nearly all the water (as the rice will be soft or gprainy, 
according to the quantity of water left on it when put to 
steam, and the length of time allowed in the steaming ; the 
larger the quantity of water, and the shorter the steaming, 
the softer will be the rice). Cover the vessel for 15 minutes 
on a very slow fire, stirring it occasionally. 

HOW TO WASH RICE. 

Pour upon it water enough to cover it ; stir it round brisk- 
ly with the hand for several seconds ; pour off the water, 
and add fresh ; stir as before, and repeat this several times. 
The whiteness of the rice depends, in a gre^t degree, upon 
the washing being thorough. 

PREPARING RICE OR HOMINY. 

Boil the rice or hominy in the ordinary way, in a pot 
lined with china. After being well soaked, dip the pot into 
cold water, and it will come out in a cake. 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 71 

EGG PLANTS. 

Parboil them, after splitting them in half, scrape out the 
middle, which you chop up with little slips of bacon, onion cut 
up small, and crumbs of bread mixed with a raw egg ; then 
fiM the skins with this stuffing and bake them nicely. The 
bread is also grated on the surface of them. 

STUFFED EGG PLANT. 

Cut in half, take out the centre, boil the inside ; when soft, 
chop fine, and season with fried onions, parsley, egg, salt, 
butter, pepper and bread, then stuff the outsides ; cover with 
bread crumbs, and add the insides of fresh tomatoes, if you 
choose. 

TURKISH EGG PLANT.

beef, mutton or veal, very fine, season with one fine chopped 
onion, 6 whole peppers, ( teaspoon cloves, ditto allspice, 
celery seed, white pepper and salt, put in baking dish a 
layer of egg plant, then of beef, and so on until it is filled, 
having layer of egg plant on top ; pour cold gravy or water 
on the whole ; cover with, another dish when set in oven, but 
remove it in time to letithe top brown a little before done. 

TO COOK SALSIFY. 

Boil salsify, or vegetable oysters, till the skin comes ofi 
easily ; when takan ofi, cut the roots in pieces, about the 
size of an oyster ; put into a deep vegetable dish a layer of 
crumbs of bread or crackers, a little salt, pepper and nut- 
meg, and a covering of butter as thin as you can cut it, 
then a lay^^ of salsify ; these layers must be put alternately, 
until the dish is filled, having crumbs of bread on the top ; 
pour in them as much water as the dish will hold, and bake 
brown. 

SALSIFY OYSTERS. 
Scrape and boil the salsify, then beat fine in a mortar ; 



^ 



72 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

season with salt and red pepper ; mix them in a batter of 
eggs, and a very little flour, drop the size of an oyster and 
fry a light brown. 

SALSIFY FRITTERS. 

Scrape the salsify and lay it in water to prevent its be- 
coming black ; boil it quick, and mash it fine, mix it in a 
batter prepared with 5 eggs, beaten very light, yolk and 
white separate ; add 1 pint of milk, a large spoonful of but- 
ter, and thicken the whole with flour, to the consistency of 
fritter batter ; then stir in the salsify and fry them nicely ; 
season with pepper and salt to the taste. It requires a very 
large bunch of salsify for this batter. 

CAROLINA BOILED RICE. 

' Pick your rice clean, and wash it in two cold waters, not 
draining off the last water, till you are ready to put the 
rice on the fire. Prepare a saucepan with water and a little 
salt in it, and when it boils, sprinkle in the rice ; boil it hard 
twenty minutes, keeping it covered ; then take it from the 
fire and pour off the water, afterwards set the saucepan on 
the back of the stove, with the lid ofi, to allow the rice to 
dry and t^e grains to separate. 

Rice, when properly boiled, should be soft and white, 
every grain separate and alone. It is a nice embellishment 
to either roasted or boiled chickens. 

RICE, AS COOKED IN JAPAN. 

Pour on just enough cold water to prevent the rice from 
burning to the pot, (which has a close fitting cover), and set 
it on a moderate fire ; the rice is steamed rather than boiled, 
until it is nearly done, then take off the cover of the pot, 
and allow the surplus steam and water to escape ; do aot for- 
get to add the necessary salt before boiling. 

CORN BAKED IN A DISH.

CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 73 

with salt, pepper and butter, turn into a baking dish; beat 
an egg and spread over the top ; bake 20 minutes. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Grate from uncooked ears. For batter, 1 cup flour, 1 egg, 
milk enough to soften the whole sufficiently, add salt and 
pepper; fry brown in thin cakes. Salsify boiled, mashed, 
and prepared in the same way, is an excellent substitute for 
oyster fritters. 

CORN OYSTERS. 

Twelve ears of corn, I cup of flour, a teaspoonful of salt, 
ditto of pepper, 1 egg ; stir well and fry in butter. 

CORN OYSTERS. 

Grate the corn while green and tender, with a coarse grater, 
into a deep dish. To 2 ears of corn allow 1 egg ; beat the 
whites and yolks separately, and add them to the corn, with 
1 tablespoonful of wheat flour, and 1 of butter, salt and pep- 
per to the taste ; lay them in hot butter with a spoon and 
fry them on both sides. 

VERY HEALTHY SLAW. 

Take a nice, fresh, white cabbd.ge, wash and drain it, and 
cut ofi the stalk ; shave it in small and very eveA shreds, 
with a cabbage cutter, or a sharp knife ; put it into a deep 
china dish, and prepare the following dressing for it : take 
J pint of best cider vinegar, and mix it with i lb. of 
fresh butter, divided into 4 bits, and rolled in flour ; a small 
saltspoon of salt, and the same quantity of cayenne ; stir 
this all well together, and boil it in a saucepan. Have ready 
the yolks of 4 eggs nicely beaten ; as soon as the mixture 
has boiled, take it ofl the fire, and stir in the beaten egg ; 
then pour it boiling hot over the shred cabbage, and mix it 
well all through with a spoon ; set it to cool on ice, or in the 
open air. ' It must be perfectly cold before it is placed on 
the table.

. '■ ,* put it in a deep dish, cover it closely and set it on the top 

*: • , . of a stove, or in a bake oven, till it is warm all through, 

then make a dressing as for cold slaw ; pour it boiling over 

the cabbage ; cover the dish, and send it to the table warm 

as possible. 

TO BOIL A CAULIFLOWER. 

Let it lie a short time in salt and water, then put it into 
boiling water, with a handful of salt ; keep the pot uncov- 
f ered, and skim the water well. A small cauliflower will re- 

quire 15 minutes, a large one 20, to boil ; dress with drawn 
butter. 

STEWED SPINACH. 

When the' spinach is nicely picked and boiled, press it 
well in a cullender ; then add some pepper and salt, a spoon- 
ful of fresh butter, and put it back in the skillet, and let it 
stew gently a little lonj^er, adding a small cup of sweet 
cream. 

TO BOIL ARTIOJ^OKES. 

Wash and scrape the artichokes; parboil them in the 
water, then boil in milk, salt to the taste \ 15 minutes will 
boil them sufficiently long in the water, and in the milk,

them. 

STUFFED MACARONI. 

Boil a chicken until the meat separates from the bones, 
pound the meat, and add 1 egg whole, and the yolks of 2 
others, a little cinnamon, pepper, salt, and a cupful of Par- 
mesan cheese, finely grated. After the ingredients are well 
mixed, stuff the macaroni and put it to boil in the broth or 
water in which the chicken was boiled.

• PASTE. 

This requires care and good materials ; the flour must be 
dried and sifted before using it ; the butter which is em- 
ployed washed, and all the water worked out ; the best paste 
is made with beef suet. Render 6 lbs. of beef suet ; strain it 
through a hair sieve into a clean pan ; to this add a bottle 
of the best olive oil ; stir it well and then put into jars, each 
containing about 3 lbs. ; cover tightly, and keep in a very 
cool place. Not more than 2 jars should be prepared at a 



100 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

time for family use, as the suet is liable to become musty 
and will not keep long. In making the pastry for pies, 
when you require it flaky and particularly good, sift 1 lb. of 
best flour into a pan, then } lb. of the prepared suet ; be 
careful to use the hands as little as possible, and the less 
worked the better ; when all the required suet is cut up, add 
salt to the taste ; moisten it with cold water (in summer, ice 
water) then flour paste board, which must be very clean and 
never used twice without scouring ; roll it as little as possible, 
and add another i lb. of the suet in thin slices ; between each 
rolling, add the slices of suet, and dust it with flour ; the 
thinner it is rolled, the lighter the paste. Have ready the 
pie plates or pudding ; be careful in rolling that you always 
roll from you, and make it as quickly as possible. For 
meat pies, the nicest paste is made by sifting into a pan 1 
lb. of flour ; make a hole in the centre of the dry flour and 
put into it I lb. of suet (not prepared) but strip off all the 
skin; then pour over this suet J pint of boiling water, 
sprinkle some flour over it, and let it stand for 1 hour to be- 
come cold ; add a little salt ; stir the whole with a knife ; turn 
it out on the board ; dust it well with flour. 

PYRAMID OF PASTE. 

Roll out some nicely prepared puff* paste, an inch in thick- 
ness, and cut the paste into any shape you may fancy ; make 
each smaller until the top one is not larger than a cent ; be- 
tween each piece of paste spread some nice preserve or jam ; 
then*turn up the edges of the paste, and brush the sides and 
top with the yolk of an egg well beaten ; lay the pyramid on 
a baking tin, and bake a nice brown ; serve hot. 

PASTE FOR CROQUANTS. 

Sift J lb. of flour and i lb. of loaf sugar together ; mix 
them well with a knife ; then stir in as many yolks of eggs 
as will make it into a stiff paste ; this must be well stirred ; 
then roll it on a flour board, and cut into shape of leaves 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 101 

with a cutter ; they are a very pretty ornament for tarts 
or puddings ; bake a light brown, as other paste. 

BREAD DOUGH PASTE. 

This is best for apple, peach or berry dumplings ; and a 
very good pudding is made by rolling out, and spreading 
it very thickly with any kind of jam or preserves ; then 
roll it over carefully, and tie up in a nicely floured square 
stout cloth ; have ready a pot of boiling water, and drop in 
the pudding ; keep it boiling briskly f hour ; keep a kettle 
of water on the fire, to renew the water as it evaporates, as 
the lightness of the pudding depends much on the pot 
being kept full and boiling, until served. 

PATENT FLOUR. 

Pulverize 6 lbs. of flour ; mix 5 teaspoonfuls of dry soda 
all through it, then 6 teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, and 
6 of salt ; incorporate all these, and you have risen cakes 
at hand to which add milk and flour, a little shortening ; 
make into a soft dough ; bake in tins. 

VERY LIGHT PASTE. 

To 3 lbs. of flour, add 2i lbs. of butter and i lb. of lard ; 
add to the flour 2 well beaten eggs ; wash the butter nicely, 
and then salt the crust ; this makes it flaky. Paste must be 
rolled lightly, as much depends on it. Wet it with water 
enough to make it roll easily ; after having rolled it out 
once, divide the paste and put rather morp butter in 1 part 
for the top ; if possible, get it all in 3 times rolling it. 
Paste requires a moderate heat ; if the oven is too slow, it 
will be solid ; if too hot, it will not rise ; therefore, great 
care is necessary. 

POTATO PASTE.

while hot ; put them in a stewpan over the fire with as 
much water as will make them the consistency of mush ;

another part of the butter, fold it up, roll it out again, and 
add another part of the butter; and so on, until it is all 
used ; in mixing it, use only a knife. 

HOP YEAST. 

To a handful of hops, take 3 pints of water, and boil 
strong ; also 3 or 4 potatoes, put them in a crock and mash 
very fine ; put the flour on top, then pour the hop water on 
boiling hot, mixing well with the potatoes and flour ; let it 
stand until milkwarm, and add some yeast to make it rise ; 
when it gets light, add 1 teacup of warm wator, 1 of brown 
sugar, 1 teaspoon of ginger,! tablespoon of salt; stir it 
down well, when you put in the ingredients ; let it rise and 
fall several' times, and put away for use.

PRESERVES, ETC. 



PRESERVED PINEAPPLE. 

Pare the pineapples and cut them in thick slices ; weigh 
the slices, and to each lb. of fruit put 1 lb. of sugar ; dis* 
solve the sugar in a very small quantity of water ; stir it 
and set it over the fire in a kettle ; boil it 10 minutes ; put 
in the fruit, letting it remain ^ hour ; after this process, put 
the preserve in a pan or dish to cool ; have the jars ready 
to put away for use ; cover it well with the jelly ; exclude it 
well from the air, and it will keep some time. 

JELLY. 

Those who would make fine jelly, should always avoid 
boiling the juice of the fruit, when it is desirable to have 
the article retain the flavor of the fruit from which it is pre- 
pared. After the juice is pressed from the fruit, and the 
proper quantity of sugar is added to it, let it be heated 
until the sugar is dissolved ; after this is efiected, no further 
heat is required. 

PRESERVED CRANBERRIES 

Wash the fruit, weigh it, and to each lb. of cranberries 
allow 1 lb. of loaf sugar, dissolved, ^ pint of water to 1 lb. of 
sugar ; set it on the fire in a preserving kettle, boiling it 10 
minutes ; then put in the fruit and boil slowly till it is soft 
and a ruby color ; put away in glass jars, with brandied 
paper on the top ; exclude the air with kid tightly sealed 
over the jars. 

PRESERVED ORANGE PEEL. 

Put the peels in salt and water for 3 days, changing it 
each day ; then put them in fresh water until they are ten- 
der ; make a rich syrup, and finish as other preserves.

pulverized, then a layer of pines ; then one of sugar and 
another of pines, until the jar is full; tie up tight, to 
exclude the light and air ; this is delicious, and keeps well ; 
not to be scalded. 

LEMON CITRON. 

Turn water on nice, fresh lemon peels ; soak them till all 
the white pulp can be scraped off; boil till soft; preserve

spoonful of cold water ; after the boiling ceases, put it on 
the fire again ; do this 3 times, and the last time take it ofi 
and let it settle ; take ofi the scum, and strain the syrup 
through a jelly bag. 

BAKED QUINCES. 

Gather the quinces when ripe, wash them nicely and put 
them in an oven to bake ; when quite soft, take them out, 
cut them open, and serve with butter, sugar, and a little 
nutmieg, while hot ; this is a nice dish for dessert or tea. 

ORANGE WAFERS. 

Take the best oranges, cut them in half, and take out the 
seeds and juice ; boil them in 3 or 4 waters (always hot) 
until they are tender, and then beat them to pulp in a mar- 
ble mortar, and rub them through a hair sieve ; to 1 lb. of 
this pulp allow 1^ lbs. of loaf sugar; take ^ of the sugar 
and boil it with the oranges till it becomes ropy ; then take 
it from the fire, and when cold, make it up in paste with 



/ 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK, 185 

the other i of the sugar ; make but a little at a time, for it 
will dry fast ; then with a rolling pin roll them out as thin 
as tifiery, upon paper ; cut them round with a wineglass ; let 
them dry, and they will look clear. 

PRESERVED FIGS. 

Pick the white or brown figs when a little more than half 
ripe ; peel them very thin, and to 1 lb. of fruit put | lbs. of 
sugar; make a syrup, and put the figs into it with lemon ' 
peel and ginger; let them boil till clear, stirring frequently. 

PRESERVED TOMATOES. 

Take the tomatoes while small apd green, put them in 
cold clarified syrup, with 1 orange, cut in slices, to every 2 
lbs. of tomatoes ; but if very superior preserves are wanted, 
add, instead of the oranges, 2 fresh lemons to 3 lbs. of toma* 
toes ; simmer them over a slow fire for 2 or 3 hours. 

QUINCE CHEESE. 

Take fine ripe quinces, pare and core them, cut them into 
pieces and weigh them ; to each lb. of the cut quinces allow 
i lb. of the best brown sugar ; put the cores and parings into 
a kettle with water enough to cover them, keeping the lid 
of the kettle closed ; when you find they are all boiled to 
pieces and quite soft, strain off the water over the sugar, and 
when it is entirely dissolved, put it over the fire and boil it 
to a thick syrup, skimming it well ; when no more scum 
rises, put in the quinces ; cover them closely, and boil them 
all day over a slow fire, stirring them and mashing them 
down with a spoon till they are a thick smooth paste ; then 
take it out and put it into buttered deep pans or dishes ; let 
it set to get cold ; it will then turn out so firm that you may 
cut it into slices like cheese ; keep it in a dry place in broad 
stone pots. It is intended for the tea table.

PRESERVED PEPPERS. 

Take the small round peppers while they are green, ex- 
tract the seeds and cores with a sharp penknife, and then 
put the outsides into a kettle with vine leaves and a little 
alum to give them firmness, and assist in keeping them 
green ; flavor with lemon or ginger. Water melon rind is 
done in the same way : allow 1 pint of water to 1 J lbs. of 
si^ar mixing with it some white of egg beaten to a stiff 
froth ; boil and skim it, and when the scum ceases to rise, 
put in the fruit. 

TOMATO JELLY. 

Fill a large jar with slices of the ripest and best tomatoes ; 
lay a cloth over the jar, and over that put a piece of dough, 
to keep in the heat ; place the jar in a large pot of water, and 
boil 4 or 5 hours constantly ; then strain the juice through 
a coarse hair sieve, and to every pint of juice add 1 lb. of the 
best brown sugar, if you wish the jelly very sweet, or half 
that quantity, if to eat with meat ; add the whites of 8 eggs 
to every gallon of juice; skim it and boil till nearly half 
evaporated ; then put it into glasses, and keep them in the 
sun till sufficiently thick. A very good jelly may be made 
to eat with meat, by putting salt, pepper, mace and nutmeg, 
instead of sugar. 

GRAPE JELLY. 

Pick the grapes from the stems ; wash and drain them ; 
mash them with a spoon ; put them in the preserving kettle, 
and cover them closely with a large plate ; boil them 10 min- 
utes ; then pour them into the jelly bag, and squeeze out the 
juice ; allow a pint of juice to 1 lb. of sugar ; put the sugar 
and juice into the kettle, and boil them 20 minutes, skim- 
ming them well ; fill the glasses while the jelly is warm, and 
tie them up with brandy papers. 

PEACH JELLY. 
Wipe your peaches perfectly dry, after washing them, 



i 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 187 

(they should be free-stones and perfectly ripe) ; cut them 
in quarters ; crack the stones and break the kernels small ; 
put the peaches and the kernels into a covered jar; set 
them in boiling water, and let them boil till they are soft ; 
strain them through a jelly bag ; add 1 lb. of loaf sugar to 1 
pint of juice; put all in the preserving kettle; boil them 20 
minutes. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Take the weight of raspberries and sugar ; pick the beryies 
very carefully, and lay them, with the sugar, in a stone jar 
overnight; in the morning boil it until it begins to jelly; 
the great secret of making nice jam, and preserving the 
raspberry flavor, is to boil it enough ; in this particular, 
however, housekeepers differ. 

TO STEW APRICOTS. 

Put your fruit on in bell metal with plenty of water to 
cover them ; lay grape vine leaves or grass on top ; let them 
boil till tender, by which time they will probably become 
green ; put your sugar in another skillet, allowing ^ pint of 
water, or more (if you wish a greatdeal of syrup) and boil 
it till quite clear ; then take the fruit from the water, and 
put them into the syrup to Hoil together till the syrup is as 
thick as you wish. 

STEWED APPLES. 

To 2J lbs. of apples put 1^ lbs. of coarse white sugar, 
which must be clarified with the whites of 3 eggs, after hav- 
ing put more than a quart of water to the beaten sugar ; as 
the apples are peeled, they must be dropped in water; 
when the syrup is sufficiently clear, put them in; when 
half done, add orange peel and cut citrpn. 

WHITE COMPOTE OP PEARS. 

Blanch as many pears as you intend to use, whole, with 
the skins on, in boiling water ; take them out when soft, 



1 



188 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

peel and put into cold water ; have your syrup ready in the 
stewpan ; when it is boiling hot, put in the pears, with a 
slice of lemon, to keep them white; when thoroughly 
stewed take them out and serve in the syrup ; they may 
be served hot or cold. 

WHITE COMPOTE OF APPLES. 

Cut 6 large apples in half, peel and take out the seeds ; 
stew them in 1 pint of water, the juice of ^ a lemon and 
sugar ; when the apples are sufficiently tender take them out 
and arrange them in the dessert dish ; let the syrup keep on 
boiling till it is clear and rich ; then pour it over the apples. 

DRIED CHERRIES. 

Stew the cherries with a little sugar for a short time ; then 
spread them on dishes and set them in the sun ; as they 
dry pour the syrup over them, a little at a time, for 3 or 4 
days ; when dry, pack them away in boxes or jars, putting 
a layer of cherries with a layer of sugar, and a little whisky 
sprinkled between. 

CHERRY JAM. 

Stone the cherries (they should be the short stem) ; take 
equal quantities of sugar and fruit, and boil slowly 
till it is almost a jelly ; it is delicious and keeps well. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Take 1 dozen large juicy apples, pare and core them, but 
do not cut them in pieces ; put them side by side into a large 
baking pan, and fill up with white sugar the holes from 
whence you have extracted the cores ; pour into each a lit- 
tle lemon juice, and stick in everyone a long piece of lemon 
peel evenly cut ; into th« bottom of the pan put a very little 
water, just enough to prevent the apples from burning; bake 
them about 1 hour, or till they are tender through, but not 
till they break ; when done, set them away to get cold ; if 
closely covered they will keep 2 days ; they are very nice 



J 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 189 

with cream, eaten at tea, or at dinner, with boiled custard 
poured over them. 

BAKED PEARS. 

The best for baking are the large pound pears ; remove the 
skins ; cut them in half, and take out the cores ; lay them 
in a deep dish, with a thin slip of lemon peel in the place 
from which each core was taken ; sprinkle them with sugar, 
and strew some cloves or pounded cinnamon among them ; 
pour into the dish some port wine ; to 1 dozen large peftrs 
allow 1 lb. of sugar, and 1 pint of wine; cover the dish with 
a large sheet of brown paper, tied on ; set it in a moderate 
oven and let them bake till tender all through, which you 
may ascertain by sticking a straw through them ; you must 
not let them remain long enough in the oven to break to 
pieces. 

CHARLOTTE DES POMMES. 

Pare, core and mince 14 or 15 very nice apples ; put them 
into a frying pan with some loaf sugar, a little pounded 
cinnamon, grated lemon peel, and 2^ ounces of fresh butter ; 
fry them i hour over a quick fire, stirring them constantly ; 
butter a shape of the size the charlotte is intended to be ; 
cut strips of bread 2 inches wide, and long enough to reach 
from the bottom to the rim of the shape, so that the whole 
be lined with bread ; dip each bit into melted butter, and 
then put a layer of the fried apples, and one of apricot jam 
or marmalade, and one of bread dipped into butter ; begin 
and finish with it ; bake it in an oven for nearly 1 hour ; 
turn it out to serve it ; it may be boiled and served with a 
sweet sauce. 

PEACH TART. 

Take ripe, juicy, free-stone peaches, pare them and cut 
them into small pieces, (leaving out the stones, half of 
which must be cracked, and the kernels blanched and 
mixed with the peaches) ; mix in a sufficient quantity of 



190 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

BUgar, to make them very sweet, and set the peaches away 
till the sugar draws out the juice; then stew them (without 
water) till quite soft ; take them out, mash them with the 
back of a spoon, and set them away to cool ; have ready 
Qome shells of fine puff paste baked a ligkt brown ; when 
cool, put the peaches into the shells ; having first mixed the 
atewed fruit with cream ; grate white sugar over them. 

TO PRESERVE STRAWBERRIES. 

To 1 lb. of strawberries add 1 lb. of sugar, strew it over 
them, and let them remain until they have made a syrup ; 
put them in a skillet, and let them simmer over a fire until 
they are half or two-thirds done ; take them off and spread 
them in dishes ; they must remain in the sun^ntil they 
are sufficiently cooled, to keep the summer ; be careful not 
to bruise the strawberries in stirring them. 

QUINCE JAM. 

Put equal weight of loaf sugar with the fruit ; mash them 
well together, and stew them until they become sufficiently 
thick, which you can ascertain by cooling a little ; if stewed 
too long, the color of the fruit will change ; if put away 
in moulds, it forms a pretty dish for a tea table. 

PRESERVED APPLES. 

Take equal weights of white sugar and apples ; peel, core 
and chop the apples fine ; allow to every 3 lbs. of sugar 1 
pint of water ; then boil the sugar quite thick, skimming it 
well ; add the apples to the grated peel of 1 or 2 lemons and 
2 pieces of white ginger ; boil until the apples look clear and 
yellow ; this will keep for years. 

PRESERVED FIGS. 

The white figs must be nearly ripe ; score them across, as 
deep as the outside skin ; make a syrup of white sugar, equal 
weight with the figs, which you may clarify, if you see 
proper ; after this process put in the figs and boil them 



V 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 191 

gently, until they look clear ; then take them off the fire and 
again boil the syrup, till very thick and rich ; pour it over 
the figs hot. 

PRESERVED TOMATOES. 

To 1 lb. of tomatoes put 2 lbs. of sugar ; make the syrup 
first, and then put the fruit in, and let it remain a short time 
over a slow fire ; they do not require a great deal of cooking. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Take fine, large, ripe oranges, with thin deep colored skins ; 
weigh them, and allow to each lb. of oranges, 1 lb. of loaf 
sugar ; pare off* the yellow outside of the rind from half of 
the oranges as thin as possible, and put it into a pan 
with pl^y of cold water ; cover it closely to keep in the 
steam, and boil it slowl3'^ until it is so soft that the head of 
a pin wfll pierce it ; in the meantime, grate the rind from the 
remaining oranges, and take out all the pulp and juice, re- 
moving the seeds and core ; put the^ugar into a preserving 
kettle, with J pint of clear water to each pound, and 
mix it with some beaten white of egg, allowing 1 white of 
egg to every 2 lbs. of sugar ; when the sugar is all dissolved, 
put it on the fire and boil, and skim it till it is quite clear 
and thick ; next take the boiled parings and pound them to 
a paste in a mortar ; put this paste into the sugar, and boil 
and stir it 10 minutes ; then put it into the pulp and juice 
of the oranges, and the grated rind (w]jich will much im- 
prove the color) ; boil all together for J hour, till it is a 
transparent mass ; when cold, put it up in glass jars with 
brandy paper on the top. 

APPLE JELLY. 

One lb. of ripe apples, pared and cut thin ; stew them 
until quite soft with lemon peel ; then add J lb. of white 
sugar, and stew it J hour. 

MIXED MARMALADE. 
Take 1 peck of quinces, pare and cut them in small 



192 CR£OLE COOKERY BOOK. 

pieces ; take the rinds and cores and boil them in water ; 
strain it> and boil the quinces till quite soft.; then add 1 
peck of pears ; when done, 1 peck of peaches ; when quite 
done, 1 peck of apples ; and lastly, 3 lbs. of good sugar to 
each peck of fruit. * 

STRAWBERRIES WHOLE. 

Take an equal weight of fruit and double refined sugar; 
lay the former in a large dish and sprinkle J the sugar in 
fine powder ; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the sugar 
may reach the under side of the fruit; the next day make 
a thin syrup with the remainder of the sug«r, and allow 1 
pint of red currant juice to every 3 lbs. of strawberries ; in 
this simmer them till sufficiently jellied ; chooseihe largest 
scarlets, not dead ripe. 

STRAWBERRY JELLY. ^ 

Take 4 lbs. of the juice of strawberries and 2 lbs. of sugar ; 
boil down. 

RASPBERRY JELLY. 

Pick all the leaves and stems from the raspberries ; put 
them on in bell metal skillets ; mix a little powdered sugar 
with them, and mash them well ; stew only a short time ; 
then take them ofi, pass them well through a clean sieve, so 
as to extract as much of the pulp as possible ; then, when 
you have a sufficient quantity of juice, to every pint put 1 
lb. (dead weight)^f loaf sugar; return it to the skillet, and 
stew until you think it sufficiently thick, which you may 
discover by cooling a little. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Prepare the quinces as before directed ; take off the stems 
and blossoms ; wash them clean, and cut them in slices, 
without paring ; fill the pan, and pour in water to cover 
them ; stew them gently, putting in a little water occasion- ^ 
ally, till they are quite soft; then pour them in a jelly bag; 
let all the juice run through, pressing it« 






J 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK, 193 

ORANGE JELLY. 

The juice of 8 oranges and 6 lemons ; grate the peel of | 
the fruit and steep it in a pint of cold water ; when the 
flavor is extracted, mix the water with the juice ; add | lb, 
of loaf sugar, 1^ ounces of isinglass, and the beaten whites 
of 7 eggs ; put all into a saucepan and stir till it boils ; let 
it boil a few minutes ; strain it till clear, through a jelly 
bag ; put it into a mould or glasses. 

PEACH JAM. 

Gather the p^ches when ripe ; peel and stone them ; put 
them into a preserving pan and put them over the fire till 
hot; Tub ttiem through a sieve, and add to 1 lb. of pulp the 
same weight of powdered loaf sugar, and ^ ounce of bitter 
almonds, blanched and pounded; let it boil .10 or 19 
minutes; stir and skim well.

PICKLES. 



PICKLED CUCUMBERS. 

Make a brine of salt and water strong enough to bear an 
egg; ponr it over the cucumbers and cover them with 
cabbage leaves ; let them stand for a week, until they are 
quite yellow ; pour oft the water ; take a porcelain kettle, 
cover the bottom with fresh leaves ; put in the cucumbers 
with a piece of alum ; cover them closely with vine leaves 
and then with a dish or cloth, to keep in the steam ; fill up 
kettle with clear water and hang it over the fire, but not in 
a blaze ; the fire uhder the kettle must be moderate ; keep • 
them over the fire in a slow heat for several hours; if they 
are not then a pretty green, repeat the process ; when they 
are well greened, take them out of the kettle, drain them 
on a sieve and put them into a clean stone jar; then spice 
the vineg{ir with cloves, mace, mustard seed and sugar; 
boil well for 6 or 6 minutes, when they will be fit for use. 

PICKLED CHERRIES. 

Morella cherries are the best, if you can get them; re-, 
move the stems and prepare the vinegar with mace and , 
cinnamon, with § sufficient quantity of brown sugar, (say 
2 large tablespoonfuls to 1 quart of vinegar) ; boil all to- 
gether for a few minutes, and put it over the cherries when 
cold; put them away in jars, carefully excluding the air.. 
Damsons or blue plums may be done in the same way. 

PICKLED LEMONS. 

Wipe 6 large lemons ; put on them 1 lb. of salt, 6 large 
cloves of garlic, 2 ounces of horse radish sliced thin ; \ 
ounce of cloves, mace, nutmeg, and cayenne ; 2 ounces of 
flour of mustard ; then .«dd 2 quarts of vinegar] boil i

CREOLE GOOKEBY BOOK. 195 

hour ; set the jar by and stir it daily for 6 weeks ; it must 
be kept closed. 

PICKLED DAMSONS. 

Do these in the same way as the plums ; but as they are 
much more acid, allow brown sugar of the best kind ; plums 
or damsons may be pickled plain, and with little trouble if 
full ripe, pricked with a needle, and packed down in a stone 
jar, with profuse layers of brown sugar between the layers 
of fruit, the jars filled up with cold cider vinegar, and put* 
ting sweet oil at the top. 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWERS. 

Take large, ripe, fullblown cauliflowers ; remove the leaves 
and stalks, and divide the blossom into pieces or clusters of 
equal size ; throw them into a porcelain kettle of boiling 
water (adding a little salt) ; let them simmer, and skim 
them well ; when they come to a boil, take them up with a 
perforated skimmer, and lay them on a sieve to drain ; put 
them into stone jars (3 parts full); season with mace and 
nutmeg infused in sufficient of the best cider vinegar, and 
simmer it for i hour ; when it comes to boil, take it ofi the 
fire, and pour it hot over the cauliflower in the jar, filling 
it quite up to the top, and adding sweet oil at the last ; cover 
it while warm, and tie leather over the top. 

NASTURTION SEEDS. 

Keep a large glass jar of cold cider vinegar, and put in 
the green seeds of nasturtions after the flowers are off, and 
the seeds full grown, but not hard ; remove the stalks ; in 
this simple way nasturtions will keep perfectly well, and are 
an excellent substitute for capers, with boiled mutton ; they 
can be raised profusely in a city garden ; to flavor them with 
spice, boil the vinegar with a bag of spice in it, and pour it 
on hot, leaving the spice in the jar. 

SWEET PICKLE TOMATOES. 
. Peel the tomatoes and put 1 lb. of brown sugar to 2 lbs. 



196 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 



of tomatoes ; Bprinkle it on, and let it stand 2 hours ; boil 
them till the scum ceases to rise, skimming it off as fast as 
it rises ; then add | pint of vinegar to 1 lb. of tomatoes ; add 
cinnamon, allspice, mace, cloves and black pepper ; boil 
them slowly until transparent ; you must be very careful 
to take off the scum, as it is that which prevents its keeping. 

AUGUSTINE MANGOES. 

One lb. of horse radish, 1 lb. of white mustard seed, 1 lb. 
of white pepper, and 1 lb. of celery seed, 2 ounces of mace, 2 
ounces of cloves, 2 ounces of nutmeg, 1 lb. of garlic, i lb. 
of tumeric, 1 bottle of pure sweet oil, 1 bottle of mustard; 
mix all well together, and after you have greened your man- 
goes for three days, wipe them dry ; then stuff them with 
the prepared ingredients and pour boiling vinegar over them ; 
cork them closely and put away for use ; all the ingredients 
must be well beaten. 

TO PICKLE WALNUTS WHITE. 

Pare green walnuts very thin till the white appears ; theii 
throw them into spring water with a handful of salt ; keep 
them under water 6 hours ; then put them in a stewpan to 
simmer 5 minutes, but do not let them boil ; take them out 
and put them in cold water and salt, keeping them quite 
under the water with a board, otherwise they will not pickle 
white; then lay them on a cloth and cover them with 
another to dry ; carefully rub them with a soft cloth and put 
them into the jar with blades of mace and nutmeg cut in 
slices ; pour strong vinegar over them and pub away for use. 

PICKLED ENGLISH WALNUTS. 

Put the nuts in strong salt and water for 12 days, chang- 
ing the water several times ; after which put them in fresh 
water a short time ; then wipe them dry and put them in 
the sun until they become black ; put them in common 
vinegar for several weeks ; after that time, spice the good 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 197 

vinegar with allspice and cloves, horse radish, made mus- 
tard, red pepper, garlic, and a little salt must be added ; boil 
the vinegar and pour it over the nuts while hot. 

* TOMATO CATSUP (FRENCH). 

Take a quantity of tomatoes, put them into a tub; a 
layer of tomatoes and a layer of salt till all are in ; let them 
stand 24 hours ; then strain off all the juice, squeezing the 
pulp well, and when all the juice is extracted, put it on to 
boil ; reduce it to J, and to every gallon of liquor put 2 ounces 
cloves, i ounce of allspice, 1 ounce of mace, and boil it down 
well ; then to every 3 quarts add 1 bottle of port wine, and 
boil it a little longer ; put it away to cool and settle, then 
bottle it. If there is not enough spice, pound a fresh nut- 
meg and put it in. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

Wash your peaches in w-eak lye ; rub them with a coarse 
cloth tp remove the fur ; put them in strong salt and water 
for 7 or 8 days ; wipe them dry ; put them carefully into the 
jars; cover them with strong vinegar; add mace, cloves, 
horse radish, white mustard seed and turmeric, (if you 
like it) ; the color of the peach is improved by it and it 
sharpens the vinegar. 

PICKLED ONIONS. 

Put the onions in salt and water strong^ enough to bear 
an egg ; change the water every day ; then make a strong 
brine, pour it on boiling hot for 3 days ; then lay them on a 
sieve to drain ; put them in the jar ; fill it with good vinegar, 
add mace and horse radish ; if you wish them white, put 
salt and oil over the top ; if you prefer them yellow, add 
from 2 to 3 tablespoonfuls of turmeric with the vinegar ; tie 
them up very close and they will keep any length of time 
for table use. 



198 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

SPICED PEACHES. 

Nine lbs. of nice peaches, 4 lbs. of sugar, 1 pint of good 
vinegar ; boil the peaches in water till tender, then put in 
vinegar and sugar, with a little wJiole allspice till done; 
pare, stone and halve the peaches first; apples are very 
nfte done in the same way, for immediate use, and a very 
good embellishment for cold meats. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERS. 

Wipe and put them in salt and water, strong enough to 
bear an egg, in which let them remain 6 or 7 days ; then 
scald in vinegar to green them, after which put them in cold 
spiced vinegar. Snaps are done in the same way. 

PICKLED TOMATOES. 

Prick the skins of fair, ripe tomatoes, spread them in 
layers, and on each layer put pounded mace, cloves and 
cinnamon, pouring cold vinegar over the whole. The vine- 
gar from tomatoes, thus prepared, is a very good catsup. 

OIL MANGOES. 

One lb. of race ginger, well soaked and dried ; 1 lb. of 
horse radish done in the same way ; 1 lb. of mustard seed, 
well washed ; | lb. of garlic, soaked and bleached ; 2 ounces 
black pepper, 2 ounces of cloves, i ounce of mace. The man- 
goes should be laid in salt and water till they are yellow, and 
then scalded until they are green ; soak the ingredients 
well and beat them together in a mortar, and mix them 
with a pint of made mustard and as much sweet oil 
as will make the , ingredients into a paste ; then fill the 
mangoes, and what is left put between the layers; then 
pour over them as much boiling vinegar as will cover them. 
This recipe will answer for cantelope. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERS. 

Make a strong brine and let it boil in a bell metal 
skillet; pour over your cucumbers (which have been placed 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 199 

in a jar) with layers of fig and grape leaves, alternately, 
until filled ; then cover up closely, and repeat the next day 
with the same brines, but fresh leaves; if sufficiently green, 
scald with vinegar and water on the day following ; let 
them remain 24 hours; then boil strong, vinegar with a 
small piece of alum, horse radish and garlic, with 2 lbs. of 
brown sugar and a small quantity of turmeric, cloves, 
mace, and nutmeg, allspice, celery seed and cayenne pepper, 
say i ounce of each. 

PICKLED PLUMS. 

Take large fine plums, perfect and quite ripe ; to every 
quart of plums allow ^ lb. of the best white sugar powdered, 
and a large pint of the best cider vinegar ; melt the sugar in 
the vinegar, and put it, with the fruit, in a porcelain kettle ; 
all the plums having been previously pricked to the stone 
with a large needle ; lay among them some small muslin 
bags filled with broken nutmeg, mace, and cinnamon ; give 
them one boil up, skimming them well ; put them warm in- 
to stone jars, with the bags interspersed, and cork them im* 
mediately ; green gages may be done in the. same way, first 
rendering them greener, by boiling with vine leaves in the 
usual way. 

BUTTON TOMATOES. 

The small round tomatoes, either red or yellow, will keep 
perfectly, if put whole into cold vinegar of the best quality; 
you may add a bag of spice, if you choose. 

, TOMATO CATSUP. 

One peck of tomatoes sliced and washed ; boil or stew them 
with a little salt, until perfectly soft; then strain them 
through a hair sieve, and press as much of the pulp through 
as possible ; after which, add 2 tablespoonfuls of scraped 
horse radish, 1 large onion stuck full of cloves, ground all- 
spice, red pepper and salt, to the taste ; put all on together, 
boiling, until the catsup looks rich and thick ; when done, 



200 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

add 1 pint of strong vinegar, and 1 teacup of made mustard; 
tet the catsup be cold, before jou bottle it ; let it be free of 
the onion and horse radish ; rosin the bottles tightly, and 
put away for use. 

WINTER TOMATOES. 

Peel and cut all of the hard part of the tomatoes; add a 
little salt and red pepper; let them stew until thick enough 
to bottle ; after which, put all the bottles in an oven with 
straw placed around them (so as to prevent their breaking) ; 
fill the oven with lukewarm water ; let it boil 10 minutes ; 
cork the bottles tightly, whilst in the oven, so as to make 
them air tight ; rosin them also. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

To one gallon of skinned tomatoes, put 4 spoonfuls of 
salt, 4 of black pepper, 3 of mustard, ^ a spoonful of all- 
spice, 8 pods of red pepper ; all the ingredients made fine, 
and simmer slowly in sufficient sharp vinegar to have 2 
quarts of catsup ; after simmering it 3 or 4 hours, and strain- 
ing it through a wire sieve, (those who like it), may add 2 
spoonfuls of the juice of garlic, after the simmering is 
somewhat over, and the ingredients are cool. This is supe- 
rior to West India catsup. 

GREEN TOMATO SOY. 

Take i bushel of green tomatoes, 1^ dozen of white onions ; 
slice them thin and put them in jars, with a tablespoonful 
of salt between each layer ; let them stand 24 hours : then 
drain off the water and boil them 10 or 15 minutes in 
vinegar ; then take them out and put them again in jars, 
a layer of tomatoes and onions, spice, a little sugar, and a 
tablespoonful of sweet oil, until the jar is filled ; mix a box 
of mustard in the vinegar, and pour over them till all are 
covered ; use black pepper, mace, cloves, allspice, mustard 
seed, coriander and celery seed ; spices to be bruised. 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 201 

PEPPER MANGOES. 

Take large, green peppers and put them in salt and water 
and let them stand 9 days ; the day before you are to take 
them out, get nice white cabbages and chop them very fine ; 
sprinkle them well with salt and let them stand all night ; 
in the morning drain ofi the water, and mix with them 
celery seed, mustard seed, and a little turmeric, and all 
kinds of spice, and moisten the whole with pure sweet oil ; 
then take the seed out of the peppers and stuff the pods 
with the above mixture ; cover them with boiling vinegar 
and tie them up closely. 

A QUICK WAY OF PICKLING CABBAGE- 

Take 2 nice white cabbages and quarter them ; if very 
large more than quarter them ; and put them in salt and

USEFUL RECEIPTS. 

How to test fish when thoroughly cooked : lift it upon the 
dish and insert a thin bladed knife in the thickest part close 
to the bone ; if the bone readily divides from the fish, it 
should be taken from the fire ; it is done. 

When boiling puddings have the water boiling when the 
pudding is put in, and do not let it stop till you take out ; 
dip the cloth in cold water, and it will release the pudding 
easily. 

Whites of eggs should always be beaten till they become a 
heap of stiff froth, without any liquid at the bottom and till 
it hangs from the folk without dropping. 

A few drops of glycerine in a bottle of mucilage will cause 
the mucilage to adhere to glass, when used upon labels. 



214 CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 

Before you cut an iced cake cut the icing by itself with a 
small sharp knife. 

Carbonate of soda applied to the bite of a spider or any 

venomous creature will neutralize the poisonous effect al- 

^ most instantly ; it acts like a charm in case of a snake bite. 

Cement for broken glass : slake some quicklime with 
boiling water, and collect some of the fine powder of the 
lime ; take the white of an egg well beaten, with an equal 
bulk of water, and add the slaked lime to it to form a thin 
paste ; use quickly, and it will resist, when dry, boiling 
water. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

Whites of 14 eggs, yolks of 7 eggs, 10 ounces of flour ; 1 
lb. of sugar. 

OMELETTE SOUPFLfi. 

Put the yolks of 6 eggs in a large basin; a dessert- 
spoonful of potato flour, 1 dessertspoonful of orange flower 
water ; add a very little salt; stir these together 
with a wooden spoon for about 10 minutes ; then whip the 
6 whites and mix them in lightly with the batter ; next put 
2 ounces of butter into a saucepan ; set it on the fire, and as 
soon as the butter begins to sputter, pour the batter into it ; 
set the pan over the fire and as the batter becomes partial- 
ly set round the sides and at the bottom, toss it over gently 
and then turn the omelette out neatly in the form of a dome 
on a silver dish greased with butter ; put it in the oven and 
bake it for about 12 minutes ; when it is ready to send to 
table, shake some sugar over it and serve immediately. 

TO boil:;fish. 

In boiling fish use invariably cold water. If a fish is put 
into boiling water, the flesh being softer than the meat of 
animals, the act of boiling causes it to break up. When 
water is boiling in which the fish has been placed, remove 



CREOLE COOKERY BOOK. 215 

it from the fire and let the'^fish simmer ; a boiled fish is 
done when the fins can be easily removed. 

NEUTRALIZING POISON WITH SWEET OIL. 

A poison of any description may be rendered almost in- 
stantly harmless, by swallowing 2 gills of sweet oil. An 
individual with a strong constitution should take nearly 
twice that quantity. The oil will neutralize almost every 
form of vegetable, animal or mineral poison with which 
physicians and chemists are acquainted. 

DRAWN BUTTER. 

Two teaspoonfuls of flour, i lb. of butter ; stir this into 
4 tablespoons of boiling water, stirring until all of the but- 
ter is melted. This is the foundation of most of the sauces 
for mutton fish, and poultry. Egg sauce is made by adding 
to the drawn butter, the yolks of 4 hard boiled eggs and a 
little more boiling water. - 

BEEP TEA FOR INVALIDS.
