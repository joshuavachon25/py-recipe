CANDY. 

"Sweets to the Sweet." 

Home-made candy is cheaper and purer than that generally bought at the 
stores. Much of the candy bought is made from impure sugars and flavor- 
ings, and sometimes dangerous coloring matter has been found in cheap 
candy. 

Candy Makers' Terms. — Candy makers use soft ball, hard ball, thread, 
and the crack to describe sugar at different stages in its cooking. 

Soft ball means sugar cooked till a little, dropped into cold water and 
rolled between the fingers, becomes a soft ball. 

Hard ball means sugar cooked till a little, dropped into cold water and 
rolled between the fingers, becomes a hard ball. 

Thread mean sugar cooked till a drop let fall from a spoon spins itself 
into a fine thread. 

The Crack means sugar cooked till it becomes brittle if dropped into cold 
water. 

Helps to Successful Candy Making. — Before starting to make candy have 
ready all materials and utensils for cooking. If nuts are to be used, have 
them ready also. Have the pans buttered. Have cold water ready in which 
to try the candy. After pouring the cooked candy into the pan, do not mar 
its surface by putting the scrapings from the pan on it.

One-quarter teaspoon cream of tartar Three-quarters cup water 

Put the sugar, cream of tartar and water into an agate saucepan and stir 
the mixture thoroughly. Place it on the range and heat it slowly to the boil- 
ing point. Boil it without stirring until the sirup threads, or until it forma 
a soft ball in cold water. After the sirup has been boiling a few minutes 
sugar will adhere to sides of the saucepan. This should be removed by 
washing it off with a piece of soft cloth dipped in cold water. When the 
fondant is cooked, add the vanilla, pour the sirup slowly on a large platter, 
and let it stand until it is nearly cool, or until it can be handled. Knead it,

and as frosting for cakes. 

Any other flavoring may be substituted for vanilla.

For the Invalid Tray. 

'"Simple diet is best, for many dishes bring many diseases." 

Importance. — f'ood for the sick is a matter of freat importance, as in 
many cases a patient's recovery depends on the kind, quality, and the quan- 
tity of food furnished during illness. 

The appetite of those who are sick is poor. And generally speaking, a 
sick patient has no desire for food unless it is selected to his liking, cooked 
well, served attractively, and served in small quantities. So the skillful 
housekeeper must be able to know what kinds of food are good for invalids, 
and she must know how to prepare and serve it in such a way that the in- 
valid will desire to eat it. 

Diet for the sick is classified as liquids, semi-solids, and convalescent 
foods. Liquid diet consists entirely of liquid food, such as milk, beef tea, 
beef juice, strained broths, strained gruel and cooling drinks. These are 
given during severe illnesses. 

Tea, coffee, and other stimulants should be given only when the physician 
consents ro their use by the invalid. 

Semi-solids arc given in less severe illness, or when a patient is beginnings 
to improve. This diet includes everything in liquid diet and also easily di- 
gested foods.

m a double boiler one and one-half hours. Strain it and dilute it with milk 
or cream. 

Steamed Rhubarb Sauce. 

One quart rhubarb (cut into one-half inch pieces) Two cups sugar 

Cut off the leaves and the root and wash the stalks and cut them into one- 
half inch lengths. Put the rhubarb into a double boiler, add the sugar, and 
cover the boiler tight. Cook the rhubarb until it is soft; do not stir it, as 
j'ieces should be unbroken. 

Pan-Broiled Oysters. 

Toast thin slices of stale bread and keep them hot. Clean oysters and 
v.ipe them dry. Put them into a saucepan without water, shaking the sauce- 
pan until the oysters are plump and the edges begin to curl. Season them 
with butter, salt, and pepper, and serve them at once on the toast.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS. 

To prevent clothes from freezing to clothesline— Soak clothes in salt and 
\. ater. Rub wet cloth over line just before hanging clothes out to dry. 

To cook string beans quickly — ^Add a pinch of soda to water and you will 
find they cook much quicker. 

To remove odor of cabbage and corned beef from kitchen — Sprinkle a lit- 
tle coffee on the stove and it will remove odor. 

Sprinkle a little flour over suet when chopping it, to prevent the pieces 
Slicking together. 

Keep cranberries in a cool place in cold water; will keep for weeks. 
To make whites of eggs beat up quickly, add a pinch of salt. 
The juice from a ripe tomato will remove stains from the hands and 
whiten them. 

Cabbage chopped and seasoned well with celery salt is a good substitute 
for celery in a salad. 

The following is a table of weights and measures that will be found useful 
One quart sifted flour One pound 

One pint of granulated sugar One pound 

Two cups of butter, packed One pound 

One generous pint of liquid One pound 

Two vups granulated sugar One pound 

Two cups powdered sugar One pound 

One pint of tinely chopped meat, packed solidly One pound 
The cup used is the common kitchen cup, holding one-half pint. 
You can get a bottle or a barrel of oil off any carpet or woolen stuff by 
i-j.plying dr}- buckwheat flour plentifully and faithfully. 

To remove peach stains from linen, saturate the stain with spirits of cam- 
phor before washing and the stain will disappear. 

A tin cm o*" washing soda should be kept on hand to clean pots and pans 
and sweeten the sink. The dishcloth should be boiled in soda water fre- 
quently. Ammonia can be used for the same purpose, but it is more ex- 
pensive. 

\ frying liasket, which costs only a trifle, saves much labor and material. 
A jar for breadcrumb.*, which should never be thrown away but dried in 
ihe oven and rolled out for dressing and thickenings. 

Keep a pot for fat. Never allow any fat liquor to be thrown away, it will 
ierve as a basis of good vegetable soup tomorrow. Save all skimmings from 
.ame, and all drippings from the roast. 

When bread or pastry is in danger of burning, a basin of cold water set 
Of the upper grate protects the bread and lowers the temperature, and is 
much better than covering with paper or leaving the door open. 

Mrs. D. Thompson. 

56 ' 



Grass stains may be removed from colored goods by dipping stain in alco- 
hol and rubbing spot vigorously. 

For a burn apply equal parts white of egg and olive oil mixed together. 
If applied at once no blister will form. 

Clean piano keys by rubbing with alcohol. 

To remove iron rust, saturate spot with lemon juice, then cover with salt, 
I.et stand in sun for several hours. 

Tumblers which have contained milk should be rinsed in cold 'vater be- 
fore being put into hot water. 

Never put knives with ivory handles in hot water. Hot water causes 
them to discolor and crack. 

To toughen lamp chimneys put them in a kettle of cold water, heat gradu- 
ally until water reaches boiling point. Set aside; when water is cold, re- 
move chimne}'s. This prevents chimneys from cracking. 

When a water bottles begins to look cloudy, half fill the bottle with seeds 
from grape fruit, and water; shake wel for a few minutes, take out and wash 
in warm suds, then rinse in clear warm water; this will cause the glass to 
glisten and look like new. 

Place all garbage in paper bags before putting in the garbage can. The 
can lasts much longer and is easier to keep clean. 

A long handled corn popper is very useful for broiling a bit of steak, a 
chop, or for making a slice of toast in the furnace when the kitchen fire 
isn't in cooking order. 

To soften a paint brush that has been allowed to harden, boil for half an 
hour in vessel containing vinegar to cover. The brush will come out like 
new. 

Pack glass or china in straw that has been slightly moistened; this will 
prevent the articles from slipping about. Wrap each article separately, 
placing the heaviest at the bottom. 

To test eggs, put them in water. A fresh egg will sink, a bad egg will 

f oat on the surface. 

Cubes of sugar rubbed over the surface of an orange will retain the or- 
ange flavor by absorbing the oil. Sugar thus prepared and used in tea im- 
parts most delicious flavor, suggesting orange pekoe. 

If the knives of the food chopper become black and dull, run a piece of 

sandsoap through the machine as you would if it were food; it brightens 
and sharpens the knives. 

V/hen frying anything that causes the hot fat to spatter, try sprinkling a 

little flour into the hot fat l)efore beginning to fry. This will instantly stop 
the spattering. 

Mix stove polish with milk instead of water; it gives a higher polish. 

When washing vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, dandelions, water cress, 
etc., add one tablespoon of salt to the water and all small inescts which 
can't otherwise be washed will quickly rise to the top. L. N. Crosby.

Notes on Meat., 

Cheap cut? of meat contain the same amount of nourishment as expen- 
sive cuts. 

Intense heat long applied soils the texture of meat. 

Baste meat to cook the outside, thereby keeping in the juice. 

A little vinegar added to water makes meat more tender when boiling. 

Cold water should be used in making soups. 

For roasting a hot oven should be used and then reduce the heat and let 
cook more slowly. 

Give children more milk and less meat. 

Good beef should be good red color, creamy fat, and flesh should be elas- 
tic to the touch. 

Long, slow cooking in water makes tough meat tender. 

Preservation of Eggs. 

Eggs may be preserved when they are cheap and plentiful by means of 
water glass or silicate of sodium. The eggs should be perfectly fresh when 
packed, and a five gallon crock or jar will hold iifteen dozen eggs. Nine 
quarts of water, cooled, one quart of water glass. More eggs may be added 
from time to time. 

Hard Soap. 

Five pounds clarified and strained fat 

One pound potash Two taljlcspoons jiowdered borax 

One quart of water 

One-third cup washing soda, dissolved in one-quarter cup boiling water. 

Line a box with greased paper. Put the fat on the back of the range until 
it is melted. Mix the potash and when dissolved add the ammonia, borax 
and dissolved soda mixture. Stir it occasionally, then let it stand until it is 
cold. When fat is melted and warm, pour it into the potash slowly, stirring 
all the time and continue to stir it, from ten to fifteen minutes, until the soap 
is the consisteniy of thick cream. Pour it into the paper lined box. Let it 
stand a few hours, and then cut it into pieces convenient for use. Do not 
remove it from the box for three days. ]. M.
