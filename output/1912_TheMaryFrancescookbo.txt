Dear Girls: 

This book tells the story of Mary Frances, a little 
girl whose great ambition was to help her mother. 
So anxious was she to do this that even the humble 
Kitchen People became her teachers and instructors. 
They talked to her, a thing never heard of before; 
helped her over the hard places, and explained mys- 
terious secrets she could never otherwise have under- 
stood. They wove around a simple little book of 
recipes her mother had made for her the spell of 
Fairyland; they led her through a series of delightful 
adventures such as never happened to any girl before, 
in which she lived for three whole happy weeks, and 
out of which she emerged no longer a little girl, but 
a real little woman. 

Some very wise people would call this a story 
book, some a manual training book, and others a 
cookery book, but Mary Frances knows better; she

knows that it is a Book within a Book that introduced 
her to Aunty Rolling Pin and a lot of other dear, dear 
friends, such as no little girl ever had before, and whom 
she now wishes to introduce for the first time to all 
other little girls. (I know that she gained their con- 
sent to do this because she told me so.) 

In the hope that Mary Frances' wish may be 
realized, this record of her adventures is sent out to 
the girls of America with the best wishes of

CHAPTER I 

THE KITCHEN PEOPLE 

)1LL the Kitchen People were terribly excited. 
A\ "I see my finish!" puffed Tea Kettle from 

•^ his perch on the stove. 

"That's slang!" snapped Sauce Pan, who sat 
near by. 

"Slang or no slang/' said Tea Kettle, "I'll melt if 
somebody doesn't come fill me soon." 

"Where's the cook? Where's the mistress?" asked 
Boiler Pan. 

"Why, the cook's left — left this morning and the 
mistress's sick. What's that I smell burning?" 

"That's the potatoes in the oven," said 
Toaster. 

"Oh, my lid!" cried Tea Kettle holding his nose. 
"Pour on water! Quick!" 

"Whew!" exclaimed Coffee Pot. 

"Whew!" cried Pie Plate. 
'Whew!" clanged Big Iron Pot. 

"Whew!" mimicked Sauce Pan. "Whew!— That

won't help! If you say Whew! to an oven door, will 
it open? — Somebody open the door!" 

"Good idea, Saucy!" exclaimed Tea Kettle. "You 
might try it yourself!" 

" Owoooh ! 0-w-o-o-o-h !" strained little Sauce Pan 
at the heavy door. "0-w-o-o-o-h! I can't-t budge 
it! Cauch! Cawc! Ochee!" he coughed. . "What 
smoke! Somebody else come try!" 

"Get out of the way, then," said Big Iron' Pot, 
making heavily toward the stove. 

"KJiew your arms were too short," laughed Tea 
Kettle, seeing Iron Pot couldn't reach the knob. 

"Well, they're as long as yours," said Iron Pot 
angrily. 

"Kick it open!" sug-gest-ed Sauce Pan. "Every- 
body allowed one kick!" 

"First go!" exclaimed Iron Pot. 

Whack! came a muffled sound. Then, "Oh, my 
poor feet! Oh! Oh!" 

"What's the matter?" asked Sauce Pan. 

"Nothing," said Big Iron Pot, hopping around on 
one little leg, and holding the other with_his hands. 
"Only I wish you'd had 'First go!'"

"Well," declared Tea Kettle, "unless help comes 
soon, we may as well give up all hope of rescue. This 
is dreadful!" 

"Listen, then," ticked Mantel Clock, who didn't 
mind the smoke. "I know a secret: the dear little 
girl " 

"Oh, yes, we know!" cried the Kitchen People. 

"Well!" asked Mantel Clock, "what do you know?" 

"The little girl— that there is a little girl " 

"Is that all you know?" demanded Mantel Clock. 
"Now, when people interrupt " 

"Just dying to tell," said Sauce Pan in a loud 
whisper. 

"Please, please, tell us the secret," begged the 
Kitchen People. 

"Well," Mantel Clock ran on, "the dear little girl 
that lives in our house is going to learn to cook. What 
d'you say if we all turn in and help her?" 

"Goody-goody!" Aunty Rolling Pin laughed so 
she nearly rolled off the table. 

Just then the kitchen door-knob turned, and every 
one of the Kitchen People was as quiet as a

TOASTER MAN 

IN ran the dearest, sweetest little girl. 
"Oh, you poor Tea Kettle!" she cried. "You'U 
boil to death!" and she pulled it over to the 
^cooler part of the stove. 

Tea Kettle simmered his thanks 

''What can be burning?" she asked. "What can 
it be?" and she looked all over the stove. 

"I do believe it's something in the oven!" 

As she pulled open the oven door, out rolled the 
burnt potatoes. 

"Now," she said, "now, for the toast," and she 
caught up her mother's apron from a hook, and tied 
it just under her arms, crossing the strings in front. 

The Kitchen People held their breath to see what 
would happen next. 

Suddenly she clapped her hands. 

"The very thing!" she cried, and ran out of the 
room. In a minute she was back, with a little book in 
her hands.

"Mother was asleep," she whispered as though her 
mother was still in danger of being wakened by any- 
sound — ''but I just tip-toed up to the table, and got 
the book she's been making for my cooking lessons. 
This must be it — it's Mother's writing: 

' The Mary Frances' First Cook Book.' 

I believe — I just believe it tells about toast. Yes, 
here it is, right on the first page: 

No. 1. — Plain Toast. 

1. Cut stale bread into slices, about H inch thick. 

2. Remove crusts. 

3. Put into wire toaster. 

4. Hold over a fire, moving to and fro until a golden brown color. 

5. Turn, and brown the other side. 

''Let's see if there is any stale bread. I should 
think so! a whole loaf! Now, I'll cut two slices, and 
since I want it to be very nice, I'll cut off the crusts. 
I guess that wiU be enough; oh, how I wish somebody 
was here to help me." 

"There is somebody— 7'ZZ help!"

The Mary Frances Cook Book 




Mary Frances looked round in amazement. Seeing 
no one, "Why, — where? Why, — who are you?^^ she 
asked. 

"I'm Tea Kettle, Miss," said Tea Kettle, lifting 
his hd very politely. "I'm gladly at your service, if 
you please." 

"And I!" It was Sauce Pan. 

"And I!" cried Boiler Pan. 

Mary Frances could scarcely believe her ears. 

"My," she said, "can you all talk? and will you 
help me? Isn't that grand! — But how you did s'prise 
me! Won't we have a lovely time!" 

"Look at the fire! Look at the fire!" 

"What a tiny voice!" thought the Httle girl, — ^but 
she quickly took the Hds off the stove. Some very 
bright coals stared up at her. 

"The fire is fine," she said aload, and she looked all 
about to find where the voice came from, but she saw no 
one. 

"Look down, please!" said the same tiny voice, 
this time very distinctly. 

There stood the funniest httle wire man, no higher 
than the httle girl's elbow. 



Mil' 




Toaster Man

"You didn't see me," laughed the little man, 
"but I know how to make toast." 

"Of course!" said the little girl, "you're — why, 
you're the Toaster!" 

"Yes, ma'am," said the little man, with a bow, 
*'at your service, Miss Mary Frances." 

"Try me, and see what I can do," went on Toaster 
Man. "Just put a slice of that bread into my head, 
and hold me over the fire." 

Mary Frances leaned over and gravely put a slice 
of bread in Toaster. He looked so funny standing 
there that she wanted to smile, but thought it wouldn't 
be exactly polite to so helpful a friend. But when he 
said, "Slide up my collar," in a thick, smothery sort 
of voice, she laughed aloud before she could stop, but 
turned the sound into a cough so quickly that Toaster 
Man looked up at her queerly only a moment; and 
she pulled the ring up until it held the bread tightly 
in place. 

"Now, lift me up over the fire!" he demanded. 

Mary Frances hesitated — she couldn't tell where 
to take hold of him, 

"Never mind my legs," he said, as though he read

her book. 



her thoughts, "I'll see to them," and he folded them 
up so close that when Mary Frances lifted him up, she 
could find no sign of them. 

''Oh, you'll be burnt!" she cried, as she held what 
Toaster Man had called his head over the bright fire. 

"Not I," he laughed, "not I. I like it. It's the 
toast that'll be burnt, if I'm not turned over soon." 

Mary Frances took the hint, and turned Toaster 
carefuUy over. 

"Not too close to the coals at first, Little Miss,'* 
said the little fellow. "Now,— closer! That's it!" 

"How is it?" he asked, as Mary Frances took him 
from the fire. 

"What a beautiful piece of toast!" she cried. 

"Grand-if-i-cent!" exclaimed Toaster. "Now, you 
do the next piece without my saying a word — but 
first spread that with butter, and put it in the oven. 
Now, you read in your book, and see if that's not the 
way to make Buttered Toast." 

Mary Frances opened her book. 

"Read it out!" said the httle man. 

"When I speak that way, Mother tells me to say 
'Please,'" said she. 




Qrandificent!'^ exclaimed Toaster. 



Toaster Man 



19 



"Beg pardon," said the little man, "Please." 
So Mary Frances read: 

No. 2. — ^Buttered Toast. 

1. Spread toasted bread evenly with butter. 

2. Pile one slice on top of the other, and cover with a bowl. 

3. Place in oven. 

"That's it! that's what I told you," cried the little 
fellow. "I'm always right about toast. Can you make 
the next slice without a word more?" 

"I think so," said Mary Frances; and she didn't 
utter a sound until she had taken the second piece out 
of Toaster. 

"What a beautiful piece of toast!" exclaimed 
Toaster. "It's better than the first." 

"Oh, I don't think " Mary Frances started. 

"I know!" snapped the little man. "Don't con- 
tradict me about toast! By the way," he asked, 
"why don't you make it into Milk Toast for your 
mother? it would be softer, and more palat — palat — " 

"Pal-a-table," said Mary Frances. 

"Yes," said he, "you know a good deal for a little

girl," — and he began to choke. Mary Frances patted 
him hard. 

"A piece of toast?" she asked. 

"No," he exclaimed in-dig-nant-ly, "a long word 
always makes me choke. That's why I seldom use 
them. Now, please read about Milk Toast." 

''If you know " sug-gest-ed Mary Frances. 

"Well, it's more like real grown-up people to have 
it out of a book," said the little man. " Go on!" 

And Mary Frances read from her little Cook 
Book. 

No. 3.— Milk Toast. 

1 tablespoon butter 1 cup milk 

1 tablespoon flour | teaspoon salt 

3 slices toast 

1. Make ready the toast. 

2. Heat the milk until smoking hot. 

3. Melt the butter in a small saucepan. 
^ y^ y 4. Throw the flour into the butter. Cook until it bubbles a little, 
(^TTT\ stirring all the time. Take from the fire. 

r» r • i 1 5. Pour \ the milk upon the butter and flour, a little at a time,

6. Place over fire, and gradually stir in the remaining milk.

7. Add the salt. Let boil a minute. 

8. Put slices of toast in a heated dish; pour the sauce over and 

serve hot. 



fHTH 



All measures are made level with the top of cup or spoon. To 
measure level spoonful: 

Fill spoon heaping full, and level it off with the back of a knife. 

For half spoonful, cut through lengthwise. 

For quarter spoonful, divide a half spoonful across. 

A saltspoon is ^ teaspoon. 

"That's right!" said Toaster Man. ''That's the way 
my grandmother made it. If I were you, I'd make 
only half of that sauce for only two slices of toast. 
You did so well with the Plain Toast; you go right 
ahead with the Milk Toast, and see if you can make it 
all yourself, and if you need any help, I'll be on the spot 
in a twinkle. Follow carefully what your little Cook 
Book says. You know you must measure everything 
even with the top of the spoon, or cup." 

So Mary Frances did exactly what the recipe tol^^T-fTT-H^-Qfil 
her. 

As she poured the last of the sauce over the toast, 
which she had put in a pretty dish, the little man, 
who had been running here and there, watching every-

thing she did, shouted, "Hurrah!" At least, he tried 
to shout, but his voice would scarcely reach to a grown- 
up person's ear. ''You are the best pupil I ever had!" 

"Have you had many?" asked Mary Frances. 

' ' You are the only one, "said Toaster. ' ' Why? ' ' 

"Nothing," said Mary Frances. 

"I should think," said the little man, standing on 
his toes, to look over the edge of the dish, "that that 
Milk Toast would taste awful good!" 

"Won't you try it?" asked Mary Frances. She 
was very much afraid he would, but she wanted to 
show her gratitude for his kindness. 

"Oh, no," sighed the little man, "I never eat." 

"You never eat!" exclaimed Mary Frances. 

"It may seem strange to you," said the little man, 
"but everything that is put into my head falls out 
backwards, and I simply can't eat." 

"It must be dreadful!" said Mary Frances. 

"It keeps me very thin," complained Toaster, 
^ "but if I'm not mistaken, your mother will eat all

MARY FRANCES' MOTHER 

MARY FRANCES pushed open the door of 
her mother's room very softly. 
'^What has my little girl there?" asked 
her mother. ^ 

''Oh, are you awake, Mother? It's a s'prise for 
you," and she carried the tray over to the bed. 

Her mother carefully lifted the lid of the dish. 

"Milk Toast! the only thing I could eat! why — 
who made it?" 

"If it hadn't been for Toaster, it couldn't have been 
made," said Mary Frances. 

Her mother looked at the little girl in surprise. 

"I mean," she added, "that Toaster really did it — 
he showed me how " 

"Oh!" laughed her mother, as she lifted a shce of 
toast out on a saucer. "Well, dear, anyway I want you 
to have some toast with Mother" — and she handed the 
saucer to Mary Frances, who said she would much 
rather watch her mother eat it than to have some

herself; but, after her first taste, she found how hungry 
she was. 

"It's the best toast I ever ate," said her mother, 
"and Mary Frances, dear, I feel much better already." 

She would have said more had not Mary Frances' 
brother bounded up the stairs two steps at a time 
with, 

"What do you think! I met Father downtown, and 
he says Aunt Maria's coming over to keep house for us. 
In the daytime, she must be at home; but she'll come 
over to get breakfast for us, and we'll go there for our 
dinners — and Father says Mother is going to the 
seashore to have a ' perfect rest ' until she's well. Any- 
how, I'm glad we won't starve. I wish Sis knew how 
to cook!" and he teasingly pulled one of Mary Frances' 
curls. 

"Hush, Brother!" said the mother, "you should 
have been here to see the lovely Milk Toast Sister just 
brought me. It was the best I ever ate — and she made 
it all herself." 

"Almost!" said Mary Frances. 

"Oh, yes," said her mother, "the dear little girlie 
wants Toaster to get part of the praise."

"Ha, ha!" laughed Brother, and Mary Frances, 
somehow, couldn't explain about the Kitchen Folks. 

Instead, ''When does Aunt Maria come?" she 
asked. "Does she come to-night?" 

"She's coming right over," answered her brother. 

"Oh, oh!" thought Mary Frances, "I must warn 
the Kitchen People." 

"Brother," she began, nervously, "you stay with 
Mother — I want to take these things down." 

But Brother was already sitting quietly near 
Mother, and Mary Frances hurried softly downstairs. 

"The poor dears! The poor dears!" she kept 
whispering all the way down.

CHAPTER IV 

MABY FRANCES WARNS THE KITCHEN FOLKS 

TO the kitchen door she ran, and was about to 
rush out, when she thought she heard voices — 
thin, little voices they were — so she peeped out, 
for the door was ajar, — and this is what she saw: 

Toaster Man, all tired out, was leaning back in a 
chair, snoring softly; but all the other Kitchen People 
were wide awake. It was Tea Kettle that was speaking : 

"So, he put the eight feathers in a pan, and cooked 
them " 

"Who did?" asked Sauce Pan. 

"The Jack Rabbit — and then he ate their fringe all 
off, and gave the bones to the cat. Then he bragged 
— ^he bragged that he'd eaten eight whole chickens at 
once." 

"Is that all?" asked Sauce Pan. 

"Yes," said Tea Kettle. 

"Humph!" said Sauce Pan. "Was that his recipe 
for Fried Chicken?" 

"My, I'd love to hear more about the Jack Rabbit,"

thought Mary Frances, ''but I must warn them about 
Aunt Maria"; and she hurried out into the kitchen. 

''Listen!" she whispered, with upraised finger. 
"Listen! — Mother is going away, and Aunt Maria's 
coming over to keep house. Don't ever say a word — 
she'll never understand you, and she'll scrub and scour 
you till you ache, poor things! — she'll do that anyway, 
but don't talk before her. I hurried down to warn 
you — I was so afraid you might." 

"Never fear," spoke up Tea Kettle; "we never, 
never talk before 'grown-ups' — we can't help them. 
I forgot to tell you — if you speak about us to anyone, 
we can never, never speak again." 

"Oh," said Mary Frances, "it's a secret! I'm so 
glad you told me — I came so near telling Mother about 
Toaster Man — I might have, only " 

Then the door-bell rang.

OR the land's sakes!" cried Aunt Maria. 
"For the land's sakes! Where in the world 
has that child been? Look at those hands! 
Have you been playing in the coal?" 

"I put coal on the fire/' said Mary Frances. 

"I guess I'll take a look at that fire, myself," Aunt 
Maria continued, as she started toward the kitchen. 

Just then, she caught sight of the tray which Mary 
Frances had brought downstairs. 

"Milk Toast," she sniffed. "Who sent that in?" 

"I — I made it," Mary Frances began. 

There was one tiny piece left. Aunt Maria looked 
at it hard. 

"It's wonderful," she said, "wonderful; who showed 
you how?" 

"Who showed you how?" she demanded, as Mary 
Frances stood silent. 

" N-no-body, — at least, no real person. I read about 
how to make it in my cook book."

" Your cook book — you mean your mother^ s cook 
book." 

^^No," said Mary Frances, "I mean my cook book 
Mother's been making for me. I'll show it to you/' 
and she ran to get it. ''See! — in Mother's writing — 
'Mary Frances' First Cook Book!'" 

"Well," said Aunt Maria, "you may turn out of 
some account, after all. It's about time to call for a 
ref-or-ma-tion." 

"Yes, ma'am," said Mary Frances, not un-der- 
stand-ing the big word — "do you want me to call for 
it now?" 

"Don't be saucy!" snapped the old lady. 

Then she set about washing the little girl's hands 
and face, rubbing so hard that it made the tears come, 
finishing off with the towel until Mary Frances felt 
her face shine. 

"Wonder if she thinks I'm a stove," she 
thought. "Maybe she'll black me some day by 
mistake! I don't believe she knows how old I 
am — she treats me like a baby, for all the world 
sometimes, yet she thinks I ought to know more. 
Queer!" 



'Wonder if she thinks ^rm a stove!

While Aunt Maria was busy getting dinner, she 
ran up to her mother's room. 

'^Mother/' she asked, ''Aunt Maria will be gone 
home most of the day time, while you're away, won't 
she?" 

"Yes, dear," said Mother; ''you and Brother are 
to go to her house to lunch." 

"Mother, dear," begged Mary Frances, "can't I 
get lunch for Brother and me? I was going to tell you 
I read — I found the recipe for the Milk Toast in my 
little cook book you've been making for me. I came 
up and found it while you were asleep — I just know I 
can get our lunches. Please, Mother, can't I try?" 

"Well, dear," said Mother, smiHng, "I really beheve 
you may. I've just been thinking about the toast, 
and what a woman my dear little girl is." 

Just then Aunt Maria called:

OOD-BYE, BiUy! Take good care of Sister. 
Good-bye, little Housekeeper!" said Mother, 
leaning from the car window. The children 
waved "good-bye," and watched the train until it was 
a speck in the distance. 

"I'm off to the mill-race, with the boys. Sister, — 
catch!" cried Billy, tossing Mary Frances the key. 

"All right," she called, "be sure to come home to 
lunch — twelve o'clock." 

Mar^ Frances suddenly felt very lonesome. 

" But I'll go home to my Kitchen Folks — they'll be 
good company," she thought. 

When she let herself into the house, how big and 
empty it seemed! She was almost afraid to go in, but 
she bravely locked the door behind her. 

She thought she heard a noise. Surely the curtain 
moved ! Her heart went pit-a-pat ! The curtain moved 
again. Out sprang Jubey, and scampered off into the 
kitchen.

*'0h, you darling kitten!" she cried, running after 
her. "How you scared me, Jubey!" 

Everything was as neat as a pin. All the 
Kitchen Folks were in their places, prim, and quiet, 
and scared, just as Aunt Maria had left them, but 
when they saw her they brightened up, and smiled a 
welcome. 

"How do you do. Kitchen Folks?" she said. 

"How do, little Miss?" merrily sang Tea Kettle. 

"H-o-w d-o?" ticked Mantel Clock. 

"What in the world shall I have for lunch?" mused 
the little girl. "That boy will be as hungry as two 
bears, — and I don't know many things to cook yet. 
Toast is all right for a sick person, but it isn't much 
for a hungry boy, — and I ought to make something new. 
Let me see what my little book says," and she fetched 
it out of its hiding place. 

"Oh, I know! I'll make everything! I do hope 
I get through the book before Mother comes back! 
Let's see, — here's 'How to Cook Potatoes,' and 'Eggs'; 
here are 'Biscuits,' and even how to make 'Tarts' and 
'Cakes,' — and Goody! Candy! Oh, how I'd love to 
make candy right away, but Mother said I must make

1. Scrub rather small potatoes well. 

2. Pare a ring around each the long way; drop into cold water. 

3. Drain; cover with boiling water; add 1 tablespoon salt. 

4. Let boil about 35 minutes, or until a fork will easily pierce the 

largest. 

5. Drain off all the water, and set pan at back of stove to dry 

off the potatoes. 

6. Serve in their jackets. 

"I wonder how many Billy will eat," she thought, as 
she brought the basket. "I guess about — about — 
I don't know. He has an e-nor-mous appetite. I guess 
I'll cook a hundred." 

''He'll never eat a hundred!" 

Mary Frances looked around. Boiler Pan was 
climbing down from the closet shelf. 

"Hello! How do you know?" asked Mary Frances. 
"You never saw him eat." 

"Hear that! Hear that!" cried Boiler Pan. "As 
though I hadn't cooked potatoes before you were born.

"Ho, ho!" said Mary Frances, "that must be so. 
How many can you hold?" 

"Oh, about thirty, I guess," swelling with pride. 

"Well," said Mary Frances, "you've no notion how 
many that boy can eat, and there isn't much else for 
lunch. I guess I'll cook about twelve," — and counting 
them out, she began to wash them. 

"Be sure to get all the sand out of their eyes," 
laughed Boiler Pan. "But first, will you help me 
jump up on the stove, and fill me? — then I can boil 
while you're * ringing' the potatoes." 

This done, he was very quiet, while she finished the 
potatoes. 
ir Just then the clock struck eleven. 

"Why, I must hurry," exclaimed Mary Frances. 

"I'm ready," bubbled Boiler Pan. 

"Oh, yes, I'm coming," and she dropped the 
potatoes in one by one. 

"Now, put on my hat," said Boiler Pan, and Mary 
Frances put on the lid. 

"Are they all right?" asked the little girl.

"All right!" he answered in a muffled voice. 

Mary Frances then went in the dining-room, and 
busied herself about setting the table. 

Soon, she heard a "rumpus" in the kitchen. She 
ran out. Bubbles were sputtering over the sides of 
Boiler Pan, and the lid was dancing a jig. 

"What shall I do? What shall I do?" cried Mary 
Frances, jumping up and down. 

"This hat's crazyl Take it off, quick!" Boiler 
Pan besought her. 

Without thinking, she seized the Hd with her 
fingers, but dropped it with a cry of pain. 

"I'm scalded, I'm scalded," she sobbed. 
"What will I do for it?" and she ran for some cold 
water. 

"Don't do that, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin. 
"Butter it and then powder it with baking soda the 
way your mother does." 

"I'm so sorry," said Boiler Pan, "but I really 
couldn't get my old hat off. I should have told you 
to take a holder." 

" Never mind, it's better now. Those potatoes must 
be done. Yes," as she tried them with a fork, "even

the biggest is done in the middle. I'm so glad, for I 
expect that boy any minute." 

''So'm I," said Boiler Pan, ''for I feel the effect of 
this stren-u-os-i-ty." 

Mary Frances pretended not to notice this 
speech, but carefully drained the water from the 
potatoes, and shook Boiler Pan over the fire to dry 
them off. 

"I — I — learned — that — that — wor — word — after 
year — years — of — stud — study," he said between the 
shakes, "and you — nev — never — no tic — noticed " 

But Billy was knocking. 

So Mary Frances, hastily putting Boiler Pan on the 
back of the stove, ran to let him in. 

"Hello, Sister! Here we are! Lunch ready?" 

"Yes, all ready. I'll put it on. You sit in Father's 
place, and we'll play we're grown up." 

"Scrumptious!" exclaimed Billy, as Mary Frances 
set the smoking dish of potatoes on the table. 

"What an excellent cook you must have. Madam," 
he said, after his first taste. "Such good potatoes!" 

"I have ten," said Mary Frances. 

"Ten! You are fortunate, indeed, Madam," said

Billy, for all the world as though he were a grown-up

"Yes," laughed Mary Frances, "but they're 'most 
always busy," and she held up her ten pink little fingers. 

"Oh, Billy," she added earnestly, "I'm so glad 
you like them — the potatoes, I mean. There is only 
one left — won't you have that?" 

"Oh, let's give that to Jubey — Jubey might be

OOD morning, Kitchen People," said Mary 
Frances, after breakfast next day, "this is 
a very important morning with me." 

The Kitchen People looked pleased and important, 
too. 

''You see, it's this way," she continued as she took 
her little book and sat in the rocking chair. "I am 
very anxious to get through every recipe in my cook 
book before Mother comes home, so I guess we'll just 
finish all the potato recipes to-day, — and give Billy a 
Potato Lunch! Won't that be fine?" 

The Kitchen People all smiled in approval. 

She went to the window. 

"0— h, Billy! Billy!" she caUed; "you're invited 
to a Potato Lunch in our dining-room at twelve 
o'clock." ^ 

"All right, I'll be on time," answered Billy from the 
garden. 



Let's see," said Mary Frances 



to herself, "four

more recipes — about two potatoes each. Four times 
two, — eight." 

She washed the potatoes carefully, and had no 
sooner set about paring them, than the kitchen door 
opened, and in walked Aunt Maria. 

''What in the world is that child doing? Paring 
potatoes? Did I ever! — Such thin, close parings, too! 
How well she does it! — But you must drop them into 
cold water as soon as they are pared, child. I wish 
I could stay and show you how to cook, but duty calls 
me — I must be going!" 

Mary Frances stepped to the door with her. 

"When I was your age, child, I could cook 'most 
everything and piece patch-work for quilts," — and she 
kept Mary Frances on the porch ten minutes, telling 
her that little girls weren't brought up any more to be 
useful the way they were when she was a little girl.

"Who dares correct me?" simmered Tea Kettle. 

"I dare," sputtered Iron Pot. "I dare, — and I 
dare tell you other things, too!" 

"You do, do you?" bubbled Tea Kettle. "You 
do! Well, what do you dare tell me?" 

"I dare tell you, Mister," said Iron Pot, "that 
you've got a dirty face — yes, a black face." 

Tea Kettle, it was plain to be seen, was boiling mad. 
Steam blew out of his nose in every direction. 

Now, everybody who knows anything about a tea 
kettle can imagine how very angry Tea Kettle was. 

As soon as he could get his breath, he blew steam 
all over Iron Pot. 

"My face is black, is it? Well, yours is black, — 
and it will soon be black and blue!" 

"You swallow them words!" and Iron Pot raised 
his queer little fists. 

"Sput!" mocked Tea Kettle, getting ready to 
spout again. "Take that!" 

Wang! came down the little fist, — but not on 
the lid of Tea Kettle. Oh, no; for just as that was 
going to happen, Mary Frances lifted him high in the 
air.

''Let go of me! Let me at Iron Pot!" He was at 
white heat. 

"Be quiet!" said Mary Frances, shaking him quite 
hard. "What's all this about?" 

"Iron Pot commenced it!" sullenly simmered 
Tea Kettle. "Iron Pot called me names!" 

"Why," said Mary Frances, "this is disgraceful! 
Now, you sit there!" She put Tea Kettle on the front 
of the stove. 

"And you, there!" She pulled Big Iron Pot as far 
back as she could. 

"Now, behave yourselves!" 

Then she sat down to rest. 

"What makes them quarrel so, I wonder," Mary 
Frances said half to herself. " AU the Kitchen People 
seem so kind and helpful." 

"Why, don't you know, child?" asked Aunty 
Rolling Pin. "I thought everybody knew that 
story." 

A story! Mary Frances was always ready to listen 
to a story. 

"Won't you tell me, please?" 

Aunty RoUing Pin cleared her voice, and rolled

back an inch or two to a more comfortable place on the 
table. 

"You see, it's this way, child," she began. 

"In the days of your great-grandmother there were 
no stoves, only open fireplaces were used for cooking, — 
and kettles were just as black then as that old black 
Pot there. 

"So, when the Pot called the Kettle black, the 
Kettle said: 

"'Black yourself!' and no harm was done. 

"But when your mother got that fine new cook 
stove, she bought that bright, shiny Kettle, too. 

"But that silly old Pot doesn't know that the new 
Kettle is bright and shiny, so it keeps on calling names. 
That Pot doesn't know it's fooling itself, — for all it 
sees is its own homely old black self in the shiny Kettle 
making faces. 

"And that's what comes of calling names, child," 
chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin, as she ended her story. 

Then Mr. Tea Kettle puffed steam importantly, 
and clapped his Httle lid. 

Nothing more was said in the kitchen for several 
seconds.

"Thank you!" at length said Mary Frances grate- 
fully to Aunty Rolling Pin. 

Then she added, very firmly and gently to Iron 
Pot and Tea Kettle: 

"I want you to promise me never to call names 
again, either one of you, for it makes me feel so sad. 

"Do you promise?" she asked. 

"I promise," brightly answered Tea Kettle. 

"I pro-promise," solemnly declared Big Iron Pot.

"Why, certainly," exclaimed Boiler Pan, which 
she had put on the stove half full of water, ''I 
know my part — I just hurry them right along in a 

jiffy." 

He looked so interested that Mary Frances laughed 
as she dropped the potatoes in. 

''Are they all to be boi — boiled?" stuttered the 
bubbhng Boiler Pan. 

''Yes," said Mary Frances, "all except those I 
put in the oven. Listen! I'll tell you the menu for 
Billy's Potato Lunch. We'll begin, of course, with 
soup — Potato Soup." 

"'Puree' is the word for thick soups," suggested 
Boiler Pan. "It seems more styhsh, don't you 
think?" 

"Yes, indeed!" said Mary Frances. "I do beheve

"Oh, that's true," Mary Frances repHed, "but I 
don't know how to make coffee, and Mother said I 
must make everything in the order it came in my 
book " 

"Won't you look to see if my turn doesn't come

"Not to-day," Mary Frances shook her head. 
"To-day we have milk.

''Isn't that fine! But — those potatoes must be done. 
I should think so! A minute more, and they'd 
have been burned!" she said as she drained off the 
water. 

''Now, ready for the masher!" 

"Quite ready," said a httle voice, and Mary Frances 
was not surprised to see Potato Masher tumble over the 
edge of Boiler Pan as she put him on the table. 

"Push my head down hard!" said he in a thick, 
mushy voice, and Mary Frances did as he directed. 

Suddenly Potato Masher stopped work. 

"How will you know how much potato to put into 
the soup?" he asked. 

"Why," said Mary Frances, "there were only six 
boiled ones altogether, so the three for the soup will 
^ -i If be just half." 
rC3uy« "Pretty good, pretty good for a little girl just learn- 

ing to cook," Potato Masher said, and ducked his 
head into the potatoes again. 

When they were finished Mary Frances said: 

"You know so much about potatoes, perhaps you 
can sit right up on that box," pointing to the sugar 
box, "and tell me when I make a mistake. I'm going 



"Quite

when I do anything the wrong way." 

"It — will — be — the — day — of — my — life — ever — to

Potato Masher ran his words together clumsily — 
"But I should be very much obliged to you if you would 
first wash my face." 

"Why, certainly," said Mary Frances. "I didn't 
like to suggest it." 

"Thank you kindly, Miss. 'Tis a pleasure to serve 
you," said the little fellow, as he perched himself on 
the sugar box, when Mary Frances brought him back 
to the table. 

"All ready?" asked the httle girl. 

"Class proceed!" said Potato Masher, with a school 
teacher air. 

Only twice did he interrupt her as she followed 
every direction given in the recipes: once, to remind 
her of the potatoes in the oven; and again, to tell 
her to pour the soup very slowly, lest she bum 
herself. 

"It's mag-nif-i-cent! — this Potato Lunch," said he,

"Don't make fun, Billy," begged Mary Frances. 

'"Make fun,'" cried Billy. "Just taste that 
soup — and see if anyone could make fun. It's fit for 
the President." 

"Oh — Billy!" Mary Frances laughed. 

"Maybe you think I don't mean it," said Billy, 
helping himself to mashed potatoes. "Why didn't you 
invite some company?" 

"I didn't know that Potato Masher — I mean, I

Mother's

MARY FRANCES GETS BREAKFAST 

MARY FRANCES was a long time getting to 
sleep that night for thinking about break- 
fast. 

She had her little cook book, and Mother's last 
letter under her pillow. 

''Billy writes your lunches are 'scrumptious/" ran 
her mother's letter. "I cannot tell how much comfort 
my little girl is to me." 

"I've 'most a mind to tell Mother about the cook 
book," thought Mary Frances, "but won't she open 
her eyes when I tell her I've made everything — if I 
can keep the secret! I do hope I wake up in time. 
Father said he'd call me to breakfast, when he said 
"Good-night,' but I want to slip down, and have 
everything ready when he comes." 

So she fell asleep, and dreamed she made an Angel 
Cake as big as a mountain, and that Jubey stole it, and 
fed all the hungry cats in the world. 

She had fixed the curtain so that the first sunlight 

[50]

57 



would fall on her face, and it seemed only a breathof 
time until she felt it call her. 

How sleepy she was! 

"I'll get down before the Kitchen Folks are awake," 
she whispered. 

She carried her little shoes in her hand, and stole 
softly downstairs, stopping in the dining-room to put 
them on. 

"Nonsense, you!" she recognized the voice of Tea 
Kettle. 

"Just wait till I read it out of my little book," 
mimicked a new voice. 

" For shame, you saucy Pan !" exclaimed Big Iron Pot. 

"Just wait until I read it!" 

Mary Frances peeped into the kitchen. In the 
middle of the floor stood little Sauce Pan, pretending to 
read out of a book: T^ Molrp 

Potato Pie 

Sauce Pan repeated: Ullt Ol 

"To Make Potato Pie Out of Sauer-kraut: S5UCr=

''2. Make a crust of the left-overs. 

'' 3. Bake the parings well, and serve very hot on ice.'* 

Just then Mary Frances sneezed. 

How Sauce Pan ran, and jumped up to his place 
on the rack! 

He looked so shamefaced when Mary Frances went 
in, that she hadn't the heart to scold him. 

Instead, ^'Boiled Eggs," she called. 

He pretended to be asleep. Then she took him by 
the arm and shook him. 

''Boiled Eggs!" she shouted. ''Doesn't that 
mean you?" 

"Yes, ma'am," he said meekly; "I'm such a 
'sleepy-head!' Do you know," con-fi-den-ti-al-ly, "I 
often talk in my sleep." At this the Kitchen People 
grinned. 

Wp "Ahem!" said Mary Frances, "It's a dangerous

Pot excitedly, '^I hope so, for I can scarcely wait till 
I'm needed." 

Tea Kettle gave two extra puffs of steam, but other- 
wise took no notice. 

"How do you know you'll be used?" Sauce Pan 
asked of Coffee Pot, nudging Pie Plate who was near him. 

"I come next in the book — and, besides, I'm always 
used for breakfast." Coffee Pot was beginning to 
get angry. 

"Bet we have eggs, — eggs, and toast, and — tea! 
Yes, I bet it's tea for B. this morning." 

Sauce Pan kept on saying, "Tea for B." so long 
that Coffee Pot began to cry : 

"Eggs and toast and tea, 
That doesn't mean me. 
Coffee is better — 
Though not wetter — 
For breakfast 
Than tea, tea, tea." 

"Tee-hee — Tee-hee — Tee-hee!" giggled Sauce Pan, 
pointing to Coffee Pot tan-ta-liz-ing-ly, who began to 
cry in earnest.

''Why, what's the matter with Coffee Pot?" Mary 
Frances asked when she came in. "Is it possible 
Aunt Maria forgot to dry you last night?" 

Nobody said anything — and Sauce Pan hastily 
ran toward the stove. 

''Wait/' called Mary Frances, "wait a minute until 
I can look in my book " 

"Oh, I can say it without any book — we all know 
our own tricks," boasted Sauce Pan. 

"All right," said Mary Frances, "say it — that will 
save time." 

So he began. 

"B'iled eggs — excuse me! — boiled eggs," he cor- 
rected, seeing Mary Frances' stern face. 
Q 

C^ No. 9. — Boiled Eggs. 

1. Put eggs in sauce pan. 

2. Cover with boiling water. 

3. Place where the water will keep hot 6 to 10 minutes. A quicker 
method is to boil eggs very gently 3 or 4 minutes. 

Ij0llf*cl "Why!" exclaimed Mary Frances, "I thought you 

p,wf >f ^ dropped the eggs into boiling water for three minutes

her what 'accordin' meant, and she said 'accordin' 
to the tastes of them that eats them — soft or hard." 

"I was speaking of the best way," declared Sauce 
Pan glancing loftily at Mary Frances. ''There is 
no end of ways to do it, but this is the scientific way 
to cook eggs so that they will be soft, but cooked all the 
way through and easily digested — not liquid inside 
a hard, white coat. In other words — Ahem! the 
al-bu-men (white of egg) cooks much better at a lower 
than a higher temperature." 

''Whew!" whistled Coffee Pot. 

"I wonder how it is in my book." Mary Frances 
turned to the page. "Exactly as you said!" she 
exclaimed. 

"Of course!" declared Sauce Pan. 

"Bet he peeped into the book," whispered Coffee 
Pot to Toaster. 

Sauce Pan continued: "It is somewhat the same 
way with 

No. 10. — Hard-boiled Eggs. 

1. Put eggs in sauce pan. 

2. Cover them with boiling water. 

3. Place on fire where the water will boil but very gently 20 minutes.

''Thinks he knows it all," grumbled Coffee Pot; 
"he'll be like the frog:: he'U burst with pride if he keeps 
this up." 

"Well, well, well!" said Mary Frances, "I certainly 
am surprised at what you know." 

"A Sauce Pan is a funny thing. 
Needed by every lassie, — 
Although it may be full of sauce 
It may not yet be sassy," 

sang the little fellow, dancing on the stove. 

"Old Puff-away," he began. 

"That will do!" said Mary Frances, and pro- 
ceeded to pour out the hot water. "Tea Kettle is 
my right-hand man. Don't you dare say another 
word until I speak to you" — as she put in the eggs, 
and drew him to the back of the stove. 

"And now, I'll make the coffee." 

At her side stood Coffee Pot. 

"Are you ready?" he asked. 

"Quite ready," she said. 

"Is it really my turn?" he asked again. 

"Yes," smiled Mary Frances, "it is!"

Then he began to recite ex-cit-ed-ly : 

No. 11. — Coffee. 

1. Put into coffee pot 1 rounded tablespoon ground coffee for 

each cup needed. 

2. Pour on boiling water, allowing 1 cup to every tablespoon 

coffee used. 

3. Let come to a boil three times, stirring down each time. 

4. Draw off the fire. Pour in 1 tablespoon cold water for each cup. 

5. Let stand in a warm place 3 minutes to settle grounds. Serve. 
If not used immediately, strain into another warmed pot. 

''You might pour out the first cupful to clear the 
nose — I mean, spout — then pour it back again." 

He stopped for breath. 

''Thank you, Coffee Pot," smiled Mary Frances, 
in praise, "how interested and wide awake you are!" 

"I never sleep much," confided Coffee Pot. "I 
believe it's the coffee — just 'cat naps,' you know, 
I sometimes think my heart is affected — I'm so easily 
stirred up, — although I always feel well." 

"If you always feel well," laughed Mary Frances, 
" I guess your heart is all right." 

"Oh, yes," giggled Sauce Pan, "he's awfully good- 
hearted." 




I think

''QhA^eslgi^gledl^iice pan!'

''Didn't I tell you, — 'not another word' until I 
spoke to you?" said Mary Frances to Sauce Pan, as 
she lifted Coffee Pot to the table, and measured out 
the coffee and water. 

After she had followed his directions entirely, she 
made the toast. 

Toaster Man was so sleepy, he didn't say a word 
except, "You'll do it right, I know," and fell asleep 
again. 

Just then, Mary Frances heard her father call.

^'Why, where is my little girl?" 

She knew he was looking in her bedroom. 

"All right, Father," she called; ''I'm up and 
dressed — and downstairs — and. Father, wait a min- 
ute; breakfast is almost ready. I'll call you in a 
minute." 

She ran to put some oranges on the table. 

"You can come now, you and Brother," she then 
caUed. "You sit right down and eat your oranges, as 
I bring in the other things." 

"All right, dear," said her father; "but first I want 
my good-morning kiss." 

"A kiss and a bear hug," laughed Mary Frances, 
throwing her arms around him as he lifted her up, 

"You stole a march on your old father this morn- 
ing, aU right," laughed her father. "Breakfast, 
indeed! Why, I never was so surprised in my life."

"Oh, Brother," said Mary Frances, kissing Billy; 
''you and Father sit down, and I'll bring in the 
coffee." 

She flew into the kitchen. 

Such a place! So thick with smoke and steam that 
all the Kitchen People were coughing. 

''Oh, dear! dear!" cried Mary Frances, the tears 
coming fast. "Everything's burnt up! Why, didn't 
you call me, Sillies? To sit here and let the toast 
burn up!" 

"I — I did call you," cried Coffee Pot, sputtering 
more coffee over on the stove, "but I couldn't make 
you hear." 

"Why didn't you call?" asked Mary Frances of 
Sauce Pan with a sob. 

"You told me not to speak until you spoke to 
me 

"I was asleep," interrupted Toaster. 

"Who are you talking to, Mary Frances?" asked 
her father. "Aren't you nearly ready?" 

"Sh — sh!" warned Mary Frances, with uplifted 
finger — then aloud: 

"Oh, Father, I'm so disappointed! I had every-

thing ready so nice and hot, and now everything's 
burnt up! Oh, de — ar, oh, oh, oh, de — ar!" 

"Never mind. Honey," said her father, kissing 
away her tears. ''Nevermind! There's no hurry this 
morning, I'll fix the fire and you do it all over again." 

"But I've wasted all the eggs — they're as hard 
as bricks — they cooked twenty minutes. I forgot 
them." 

"They'll be fine in our salad to-night," said Brother; 
"I love hard-boiled eggs that way." 

"Brother, you run out in the garden," said her 
father, "Sister is going to have our breakfast ready in 
a very few minutes." 

"I'll do that," cried Billy, "and I'll have a fine 
appetite." 

When they went into the kitchen Mary Frances saw 
Sauce Pan whisper something to Coffee Pot, but her 
father didn't notice. He quickly fixed the fire. 

"Now, Father," begged Mary Frances, "please let 
me do it and I'll have everything on the table in no 
time." 

"Ho-ho! little Miss Housekeeper doesn't need any 
help. Very weU!"

''I did need help with the fire, Father/' said Mary 
Frances; ^'it was a great help, but " 

"All right, Girlie," said Father, "I'll read my paper; 
you call us when you're ready." 

In a very few minutes she did call them, and a fine 
breakfast it was, too; for Mary Frances knew how so 
well that not a minute was wasted. 

"Ain't she the loveliest cook," whispered Coffee 
Pot to Sauce Pan, as Mary Frances disappeared 
through the dining room door with the eggs. 

"Loveliest ever!" said Sauce Pan. "I really was 
afraid to call her for fear her father would hear. I'm 
BO sorry " 



"Yes," nodded Toaster Man, "I can't seem to get 
it off my mind. It keeps me so sad — won't you tell 
us a story?" 

"I can't get it off my mind, either," said Sauce Pan. 
with a sob, "but I'll do my best. Here goes: 

"Our little Miss sat down and cried, 
And called her Sauce Pan to her, 
'I feel so berry bad inside, 

I wish you'd (h)eat some sugar.'" 




' I can I get it offmy mind, either."

"Oh, silly!" interrupted Toaster Man, "don't 
make fun, — besides, you know that's not true." 

"Well," replied Sauce Pan, "I thought you wanted 
a story!" 

"Pooh!" puffed Tea Kettle, "What a poor pun! 
I should think you'd all be tired out. Let's take a nap." 

"I just want to say I love our little Miss just the 
same," said Sauce Pan. 

"And I!" 

"And I!" cried all the Kitchen People.

Where's our little mistress, I wonder?" 

''Nice memory, — yours!" drawled Sauce Pan. 
''Don't you remember they all went over to Aunt 
Maria Hush's for dinner Saturday night, and for 
Sunday?" 

"Aunt Maria Hush!" roared Tea Kettle. "That's 
not her name!" 

"I'd like to know why not," said Sauce Pan. 
"Every time I go to say anything when she's here, 
somebody says, 'Keep still — that's Aunt Maria, — 
Hush!'" 

"Ho, ho, ho, hee-hee-hee!" laughed all the Kitchen 
People. 

"That meant, 'Be still,' Goosie," Tea Kettle 
explained.

"Qk, hum mm ! Q ,jali,^ak,jah." 



A Joke on Aunt Maria

When Aunt Maria and Mary Frances came into the 
kitchen later, the old lady was talking. 

'^Very creditable, child," she said, looking at the 
shelves, all in order, ''very creditable indeed. I can't 
understand it — with no one to show you how to " 

''I have my little book," said Mary Frances. 

"Book!'' sniffed Aunt Maria, putting the breakfast 
cereal on to cook. "Book! A hook can't tell you 
exactly when a piece of toast is brown enough, or a 
potato just done enough to be mealy, nor how to keep 
a pan from burning. Book! It's talent! That's 
what it is! Blood will tell. You inherited it from me. 
I never burnt pans — never in my life — there's no excuse 
for it." 

''Yes, ma'am," said Mary Frances, thinking of the 
ruined breakfast. 

"Go up, and open the beds to air," commanded 
Aunt Maria. 

When Mary Frances got back, she could scarcely 
see across the kitchen for smoke. 

"Fire!" screamed Aunt Maria, making for Boiler 
Pan on the stove. 

"I thought the house was on fire," she panted, 




" pre !" screamed flunt j^ana .

snatching it up. ''Oh, — oh, I wish I had my smelhng 
salts ! The porridge is all burnt up ! What a disgrace ! ' ' 

Mary Frances felt very sorry for her, but when she 
saw Sauce Pan and Coffee Pot holding their queer little 
fists over their mouths to keep from laughing out, and 
when she remembered how funny the old lady looked 
making across the kitchen in two steps, she ran back 
into the dining room to laugh. 

"I must stop," she'd say to herself — and the more 
she'd say it, the more she'd laugh. ''This is dreadful, 
Mary Frances," she'd scold herself; "but, oh, my, 
wasn't it funny!" — and away she'd go again. 

At length she went back upstairs until Aunt Maria 
called, 

"Breakfast!" 

Even at the table she couldn't look at Aunt Maria 
without laughing. 

"What's the matter?" asked Brother. 

"Oh, don't ask me!" Mary Frances begged, hiding 
her face. 

She didn't dare go into the kitchen until after her 
aunt had gone, for fear of disgracing herself laughing.

When she did go out to look up her next lesson in 
her little book, Boiler Pan walked dolefully up to her, 
holding out a piece of sand-paper. 

He looked so funny with a big black spot on one 
eye! 

Bowing, he began to recite: 

"Of course, you never burn your pans, 
Of course, no more do I; 
But, should such sad things happen, 
A piece of this just try." 

"I will!" exclaimed Mary Frances; and in less 
than a twinkle had rubbed all the burnt spots off. 

"My, — that's better; thank you," brightly beamed 
Boiler Pan. 

Mary Frances sat down on the rocking chair, and 
opened her book. 

"Tea! Omelet!" she exclaimed. "Isn't that 
nice!" 

Just then came a knock at the kitchen door. 




CHAPTER XII 



THE TRAMP 

MARY FRANCES peeped out of the open 
window. A tramp! 
''Oh, dear, — shall I open the door?" 
thought the frightened little girl. 

''Please, Miss/' — the oldest, hungriest-looking 
tramp she ever saw looked down at her, taking off his 
worn out cap. "Please, Miss — a cup o' tea — anything? 
I am that tired and faint." 

He caught hold the railing. 

"Tea! — my next lesson!" thought Mary 
Frances. 

"That's easy and quick! and Tea Kettle is just 
beginning to boil. How awfully cold and hungry the 
poor man looks!" 

"Wait a minute," she called. 

"I almost know how to make tea, — but I'd better 
look at the recipe. Where'd I put my book? Oh, 
here it is, — open to the place," she spoke softly. 

Then she read the directions for making

it boil. Stir, and serve. 
If not used immediately, strain into another heated pot. 

Very soon she had filled the largest cup she could 
find in the closet , and handed it to the tramp. 

'' That's the bonniest cup o' tea I've drank for 
mony a year, Miss," said he. "It tastes like the auld 
country, shure." 

"Like the old country!" thought Mary Frances. 
"That's the funniest way for anything to taste I ever 
heard of. Maybe he's so hungry he's a little bit out of 
his head. Oh, I know what I'll do ! I'U make an omelet 
for him! I don't believe he's eaten omelet since — 
maybe, since he was as little as I am — maybe a hundred 
years. He looks a hundred years old, I'm sure. I hope

Two eggs to each person. 

1. Separate yolks and whites, putting them into different bowls. 

2. Add dash of salt to whites, and dash of salt and white pepper 

to yolks. 

3. Add cold water to whites, allowing 1 teaspoon to each. 

4. Add cold water to yolks, allowing 1 tablespoon to each. 

5. Beat both very light. 

6. Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a smooth frying pan. 

7. Pour in yolks. Let cook a moment. 

8. Spread whites over yolks, making a little hole in the center 

for steam to escape. 

9. Cook slowly for 5 minutes, or until the puffed up whites look 

dry. 

10. Fold one half over the other. 

11. Turn out on a warm platter. 

12. Trim with parsley and serve at once. 

''That's not so easy," thought the little gh'l, ''but 
I guess I can manage it — he'll not be very par-tic-u-lar." 

But she had very little trouble; for she read what 
her mother had written; and followed each direction 
exactly, all the way through the recipe.

it is — a beauty!" 

"It is real pretty," said Mary Frances, feeling quite 
proud. "I just made it for you. I'm learning to cook. 
My mother's away — and I'm here all alone just now 

except for Jubey and the Kitchen F (she caught 

herself just in time). Jubey is the kitten, you know. 
My lessons just came to Omelet, and — v/hy, what's 
the matter with it?" she cried, dismayed. "It's all 
fallen flat! I wonder if I got it done. It gets flatter 
and flatter." 

The tears sprang to her eyes. "I'm"so sorry," she 
said. 

"Oh, never mind. Miss," said the tramp; "I ain't 
been chooser for mony a day — and this 'ere homelet, . . , 
or whatever it is, will be all right, all right," — and he wh&ts 
hungrily began to eat. 

"It seems to be made out o' nothin' — and 
yet it is powerful good," said he between bites, 
as it fast disappeared, much to Mary Frances' 
delight. 

"It's made out of beaten eggs," said she. "First,

"Bless her dear, loving little heart!" echoed her 
father. 

"The poor dear 'lamb' should not have been left

'^Mary Frances, listen, child! Never, when you

''Yes, Father," said Mary Frances; ''I didn't 
mean to be bad." 

''No, dear; but it would be very naughty indeed 
for you to do so again. Do you promise?" 

"Yes, Father," said Mary Frances, hiding her face 
on his shoulder. "I'll never, never do it again, dear 
Father."

"Humph!" grumbled Aunty RoUing Pin, after they 
had gone into the library, "I'd have warned her — 
only I was afraid the tramp gentleman might hear!" 

" So would we all of us," cried the rest of the Kitchen 
People. 




CHAPTER XIII 



COMPANY TO LUNCH 



MARY FRANCES listened at the kitchen door 
before going in next morning. She wanted 
to find out what the Kitchen People might 
be doing. 

''It isn't exactly eavesdropping/' she thought, 
''although it seems awfully near to it." 

"Can't you find it?" somebody was asking. 

"Seems to be having trouble," said Tea Pot. "Of 
course, he can't very well find out — being so short 
and fat, and having no nose to speak of." j 

"Well, Nosey," answered Coffee Pot, "suppose you 
try — your nose is long enough to poke into anything!" 

"So much the better for me this time. Pug Nose." Wq 

"Oh, say, stop calling names, and find out — if you 
can," cried Big Iron Pot. 

"I'll bet it's my turn again!" interrupted Sauce 
Pan. "Now, see if I'm not right." 

"He's peeped already," declared Coffee Pot. 

" 'Deed, I haven't," very earnestly.

"Oh, say, Tea Pot, if you're any good, get to work! 
See if he's right. Can you do it?" 

"Yes," repHed Tea Pot rather breathlessly. (It 
seemed to Mary Frances as if he were lifting a heavy 
weight.) "Yes, here is the place. Somebody else read; 
I'm too tired." 

"I'll read," said Sauce Pan. "What was the last? 
Oh, yes, here it is, just as I said!" 

"Oh, go 'way! Don't let him read," said Coffee 
Pot; "he'll make it up." 

"Read yourself, then, Pug Nose!" 

Then Coffee Pot's voice:

sadly. "Did you say anything?"

Mantel Clock for reminding me. 

"Let me see," said she, going into the kitchen as 
if she had just come downstairs, although she felt 
very guilty. "I must find to-day's lesson." 

She read quietly for some time, pretending not to 
notice that she found the book open with the spout of 
Tea Pot lying against one of the pages. 

"I can make White Sauce in a jiffy, and I'U heat 
some canned salmon in it," she exclaimed, picking up

I don't need his help/' she thought. ''I'll treat him 
quite in-dif-fer-ent-ly." 

"The salmon ought to have been opened an hour 
or two ago," said a sharp little voice. 

Mary Frances looked around to see who her new 
helper could be, but could discover no one. 

"How do you know?" she asked, more to find out 
who was speaking than to gain information. 

"Who'd know better?" came the little voice, so 
sharp it was little more than a squeak. "I'm Can

"Oh, so you are!" cried Mary Frances, spying him. 
I'm glad to see you. Now, why open the salmon an 
hour ago?" 

''All canned goods ought to be opened an hour or

better Opener, "to get well aired." 

"Thank you," said Mary Frances, "I'll open the

She had only just finished the White Sauce, when 
the door-bell rang. She stopped to take the Baked

with Robert and Eleanor who lived down the street. 

''Hello, Sister," said Billy, ''I told you I'd bring 
company home to lunch some day. Anything ready?" 

''By good luck, Billy, yes," said Mary Frances, 
kissing Eleanor, and taking her coat and hat, while 
Billy did the same for Robert. 

"I know now why Mother likes Father to telephone 
when he's bringing home company to dinner," laughed 
Mary Frances. 

"Oh, don't you worry, folks," said Billy, "every- 
thing'll be all right." 

"That's the highest compliment a boy can pay, 
Mary Frances, you know," said Eleanor. 

"I wish I could cook," she sighed, when Mary 
Frances dished the dessert of Baked Apples, and the 
three praised everything on the table. 

"I wish you could. Sis," exclaimed Robert. 

"Maybe some day I'll teach you some of the things 
I can make," said Mary Frances. 

"Oh, Mary Frances, will you?" cried Eleanor. 

"If your mother says so," nodded Mary Frances.

''I know she will," declared Eleanor. ''She hates 
to cook, but she'll let me learn. She never goes into 
the kitchen if she can help it. And no wonder. Our 
kitchen is an awful place to go into, Maggie is so cross. 
She wouldn't let me try." 

''Pity the poor Kitchen People," thought Mary

"Oh, we'll have fun!" she said aloud. 

"When will you want me to come?" Eleanor asked.

o 




H, my!" sighed Mary Frances, gazing at the 
great pile of dirty dishes on the kitchen 
table, where she had carried them after 
the company had gone. '^Oh, my, cooking is fun — ■ 
but washing dishes is another thing. I'm 'most tired 
enough to drop, — and there must be a hundred dishes 
to do! I'm glad Tea Kettle is full of hot water. 

^'Bubble! Bubble! Piff! Piff!" puffed Tea Kettle, 
mys-ter-i-ous-ly smiling as though he knew something 
was about to happen. 

Mary Frances couldn't see anything very pleasing 
with so much of a task before her. 

She put the large dish pan on the table and poured 
in the water, whirling the soap around in it several 
times to make it a little sudsy. 

Then she sat down to rest. 

'' Really, I didn't know I was so tired," she thought; 
''maybe my age is telling on me the way Aunt Maria 
says!"

Her weary little head began to nod, and she was sootf 
fast asleep. She hadn't been asleep long before she 
was aroused by a great racket. 

'^CHck, clack! Click-ety-clack! Splash!" 

"Come/' she said to herself, rather sharply, "I do 
believe you've been asleep, Mary Frances! You'd 
better get to work, child." 

"Click! Clack!" 

Again came the sound. 

With her sleepy lids half open she glanced toward 
the table, and such a sight she never saw! She sat up 
with mouth and eyes wide open, but nobody paid any 
attention to her. 

There were the dishes jumping higgledy-piggledy, 
pell-mell into the dish pan. 

First a cup, followed by a saucer, then a spoon, 
followed by a fork. 

"Make room for me," cried Platter, diving in 
head first. , i 

"Look out, or you'll chip me," cried Tea Cup, 
tumbling out on the other side of the pan. j I 

"I'm next!" a big dinner plate splashed in "ker- 
plunk."

Mary Frances couldn't say a word — she was so 
afraid they might break their heads. 

^'Ouw! this is hot!" screamed Little Pitcher. 

All the other Kitchen People were looking on and 
laughing. Aunty RoUing Pin was rocking to and fro, 
laughing so hard the tears were rolHng down her cheeks. 

When Yellow Bowl bounced into the water, '^ Chase 
yourself!" cried Soup Ladle, making hard after. 

In less time than it takes to tell, the dishes were all 
clean, and had piled themselves up neatly on the table. 

Then Mary Frances reahzed what had happened. 

''That was a patent dish-washing," she said. ''I 
don't want you to do that often. I was afraid my 
mother's china would be broken all to pieces! But 
I am very much obliged, this time, I'm sure." 





Tfere were the dishes jumpintf hl^ledy-

THIMBLE BISCUITS 

MARY FRANCES carried all her dolls to the 
window seat in her room, and placed them 
in a row. Then she held up an envelope. 

'' Misses Angelina, Marie, Cosette, Lady Gay, Peg, 
Master Alfonso, why, listen! Here's a letter come for 
you. What can it be? Pay very strict 'tention 
while I read it. If you'd gone to school every day 
I've been so busy, perhaps you could read it your- 
selves; but, of course, when my hands are so full, I 
can't possibly get you off, and you are so helpless. 
Aren't you 'shamed? I think — yes, I think you all 
look ashamed except Peg. If you don't look ashamed 
in one minute. Peg, — just one minute I'll give you, — • 
you sha'n't hear this! There, that will do! You 
needn't cry, dear child! Now, I'll read." 

Mary Frances cut open the envelope. 

Every doll looked deeply interested except poor Peg 
who had fallen on her side. "Why, it's an invitation 
to a Dolls' Party! Listen!

"Now, dears/' Mary Frances smiled upon them, 
''no wonder you look surprised; for that's a grand 
invitation, all written out on real paper. I had an 
awful time getting it to sound right. I'm not sure that 
it is just exactly correct yet. So we'll get dressed 
right away. Now don't all ask at once what you'll 
wear. Yes, Fonsey, of course you'll wear your dress 
suit. What of it if it isn't proper to wear it until after 
six o'clock? You have only your work clothes and that 
suit and you'll have to wear your best." 

Everybody was quiet and good as gold while Mary 
Frances finished dressing them. 

''There," she said to herself, "the last sash is tied. 
Goodness, I'm tired — tired-er than if I'd been cooking 
the whole morning! Aren't dolls stupid compared 
with Kitchen Folks? I do wonder what the Kitchen 
Folks will do. Will they talk before them? 

"Now, you dolls, be good, and take a nap," she 
warned, "so that you won't be sleepy at the party. 
I must go and get ready." 

As she tied on her apron in the kitchen, she noticed 
Aunty Rolling Pin looked very anxious and excited.

She couldn't seem to keep still, but kept rolling to and

"Well, Aunty Rolling Pin?" said Mary Frances. 

''Did you, or did you not, please," asked Aunty 
Rolling Pin, ''mention 'Biscuits' this morning?" 

"I guess I did," replied Mary Frances, "when I 
glanced at my book. Here, I'll read it out:

2. Sift flour, baking powder and salt three times. 

3. Rub butter lightly into the flour. 

4. Pour the milk on gradually, mixing all the while with a knife, 

until a soft dough is formed. 

(Perhaps not all the milk will be needed.) 

5. Turn the dough on a well-floured board. 

6. Pat it with the rolling pin until j inch thick. 

7. Use a large thimble as a cutter, and cut biscuits as close to each 

other as possible. 

8. Place in pan a little distance apart. 

9. Bake about 5 minutes.

''Ever make any biscuits, child?" 
"No, Aunty Rolling Pin, but I believe I can with 
your help, if you'll be so kind." 

" 'Deed I will, child." Aunty Rolling Pin gave a 
delighted chuckle. ''I've been waiting patiently for 
the chance." 

"I'm going to give a Dolls' Kitchen Party, Aunty." 

"Ah, I'm glad you told me, child; that makes 

everything more important than ever. So, as you 

gather together the things you'll need, you can listen — 

iJp^J j ahem! — to Aunty Rolling Pin's wisdom." 

*rjt| "You know about 'most everything!" said Mary

'^ Mother expected to explain everything to me, you 



see 

^^Yes, yes, child," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin, seeing 
Mary Frances looked sad; ''but I see you have sifted 
the flour and baking powder and salt into a bowl and 
poured it back. Instead of using a bowl, it's a good 
idea to use a piece of heavy paper. When this is 
folded funnel-like, the flour can readily be poured into 
the sifter again and again." 

''That certainly is easier," said Mary Frances, 
putting the hint to practice. 

"In order to get the baking powder into every bit 
of the flour, they should be sifted together three times. 
Now, I see you are working the butter into the flour. 
Rub lightly with your flnger tips. That's it — pour 
the milk gradually, mix well — the dough should be 
almost sticky, but not too soft to handle. Now it's 
my turn," she chuckled, as Mary Frances turned the 
dough on a well-floured board. "But if you are going 
to make Thimble Biscuits, one half of the dough is 
enough to pat out for them " 

"And I can make the rest into real biscuits! What 
a splendid idea!" said Mary Frances.

''Wonder if the handles are her ears/' she thought, 
softly patting the dough with Aunty RoUing Pin. 

As she bent over, she caught the sound of singing, 
and this is the song Aunty Rolling Pin sang: 

"Roly-poly, roly-poly, 

To and fro.

"Where?" she asked suddenly stopping. 

Mary Frances jumped. She had been rolling Aunty

her song. 

"Where?" she again demanded, her mouth full 
of flour. 

"Dear me," answered Mary Frances, "I don't 
know." 

"School, of course," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin; 
"I thought you'd surely know."

''Oh, yes, of course," laughed Mary Frances; 
''Cooking School." 

"Certainly, child," laughed Aunty Rolling Pin. 
"To what other school could you go to learn about 
me?" 

"That's beautiful poetry," said Mary Frances. 

"I think so," smiled Aunty Rolling Pin; "I made 
it up myself. It's so floury, you know," blowing the 
white dust in the air. 

"Tee-hee," giggled Mary Frances. 

Aunty Rolling Pin looked offended. 

"Excuse me," said Mary Frances, "you mean 
'flowery.'" 

"I mean what I say," said Aunty Rolling Pin; 
"isn't that what I said?" 

As it certainly was what she said, and Mary Frances 
didn't like to explain, she hastily turned to her work. 

It didn't take long to cut the biscuits, as she had 
often helped her mother in baking. She knew how 
to dip the cutter each time into flour, that the dough 
might not stick. She used the large thimble she had 
brought down from the sewing room in the same way 
as she had used the biscuit cutter.

"Aren't they too sweet!" she cried delightedly, 
as she laid the tiny biscuits side by side, but not touch- 
ing, in the little baking pan. With the rest of the 
dough, she had made three larger ones. ''One for 
each of the family," she said, slipping them with the 
Thimble Biscuits into the oven. 

"Let me see what's next. Oh, yes, the cocoa. 
I do declare, it's little Sauce Pan's turn again. No 
wonder he's puffed up," she thought. "Strange, h^

whispered loudly, ''Sauce Pan! why don't you 
speak?" 

"Don't bother me. I'm asleep," muttered Sauce 
Pan drowsily, ''sound asleep!" 

Mary Frances gasped. 

"What 'n awful story!" exclaimed the one who had 
first spoken. 

"You're not very polite to question my word to my 
very face," Sauce Pan retorted angrily. "Now, if 
someone else had told you, that would have been 
different; then you'd had some excuse." 

"Come," thought Mary Frances, "that's too silly! 
I'll put an end to this. I don't need any help with this 
simple recipe." 

Seizing Sauce Pan quite carelessly, she quickly 
made the cocoa.

them." 

''It's not much of a waste," smiled Aunty Rolling 
Pin, ''and (seeming to be seriously thinking) the dolls 
can't make themselves sick on them — eating too many, 
I suppose." 

"Well," said Mary Frances, "you see, it's like this: 

"When I my dolls invite to tea, 
It is a pretty sight to see 
The things one seldom gets to eat 
All on the table spread, so sweet; 
But to my dollies I explain. 
Don't eat too much — you'll have a pain. 

"Then, just to save them such a trial, 
I let them sit and look a while 
At cakes, and tarts, and candies, too. 
Then eat them up myself — wouldn't you? 
For thus they're saved from being ill. 
And I, likewise, a doctor's bill. 
But — just between you, dear, and me — 
They couldn't eat at all, you see."

And away ran Mary Frances to bring the dolls. 



'^It was a lovely Tea Party, wasn't it, Angle?'* 
sighed Mary Frances, putting her family to bed after 
it was all over. 

'^And you did 'behave a credit' to your mother. 
I feel sure now you will remember all I've taught you. 
Not one of you would eat soup from the point of a spoon, 
nor spread a whole slice of bread at once, nor leave 
your spoon in your cup, which is a great comfort to a 
mother. Only Peg, you poor child, you should not 
have spilled that cocoa down your best dress. But 
'Children will be children,' I 'spose — and you're 
very dear children." 

("I wouldn't have them, for the world, jealous of 
the Kitchen People — and I've neglected them shame- 
fully of late.") 

''I'm not much taken with those things called 
'dolls,' Aunty Rolling Pin," said Sauce Pan, seating 
himself on the edge of the top closet-shelf, and crossing 
one leg over his knee. "They're not much use."

Aunt Maria at the lunch table. She had

''If only," thought Mary Frances, "if only I could 
cook something for her! Wait until I look in my book. 
I wonder if she could eat to-day's lesson." 

She laughed aloud — that seemed so funny. 

"Well," snapped Aunt Maria, "of all things; to 
laugh at a poor sick neighbor in such a pre-dic-a- 
ment." 

Mary Frances blushed, but she didn't say anything. 

After lunch, she started home as soon as possible. 

Once in the house, she ran to the kitchen for her 
book. 

" Of all things! As Aunt Maria would say," she cried, 
"it comes next!"

"It isn't funny to be ill," said Aunty Rolling Pin. 

"No," answered Mary Frances, seriously, "but I 
meant she does such funny things: Last summer, she 
told Elvin Phelps if he didn't keep his bees from stealing 
honey out of her flowers, she'd shoot them — she (oh, 
dear!) — wanted — him — to tie each one — by his hind 
leg — to keep — them — home — oh, dear," laughed Mary 
Frances. 

"What did he do?" asked Aunty Rolling Pin, 
anxiously. 

"He told her (excuse my laughing — but it's so 
funny!) he would rather — put a 'No Trespassing' sign 
up in her garden for them to read! Ho-ho! Tee-hee." 
Mary Frances shook with laughter. 

Silence in the kitchen until Mary Frances felt a 
tug at her dress. 

Looking down, she spied Toaster Man.

''Thank you, — I don't like to suggest, but a

"Be grand!" finished Mary Frances. "I'm sure 
I saw that recipe; yes, this is it!" 




"Ready!'

"Ready!" exclaimed Sauce Pan, and Mary Frances 
poured the hot water. 

"Ready!" cried Toaster Man, and Mary Frances 
made the toast. 

"Oh!" cried the little girl suddenly, her fingers 
crushing through the eggshell, "what a shame!"

''A sharp rap with a knife and a quick pull with

'^ Thank you/' smiled Mary Frances, too busy to 
discover who was her helper. 

Very soon she had Hfted the poached egg with 
Per-for-at-ed Skimmer on the piece of toast. 

When she had arranged the tray, she brought it 
out for the Kitchen People to see. 

She had used her mother's daintiest china plates, 
and had scattered violets here and there over the cloth. 

"Beau-ti-ful!" they exclaimed in one voice, as 
though that was all that could be said; but this is what 
Mary Frances heard as she closed the door: 

"Wish I could eat," sighed Toaster Man. 

''I know Jube'U want some of that," he added, 
after a moment. ''That cat can eat any time of

A man's lunch 

^^^\ y|f OTHER writes that she is so glad you are 
giving Billy such good lunches," said 
Father, looking up from his letter. ^'I've 
been waiting a long time for an invitation to lunch, 
little daughter. Do you know, I'll be quite jealous of 
Billy if my turn doesn't come soon!" 

^'Oh, Father," Mary Frances begged, "won't you 
come to-morrow? I didn't think you could get away 
from the store, — and I don't know so very much to 
cook." 

"Thank you. Miss Mary Frances, I'll be most happy 
^nrjkcii^t^ to lunch with you to-morrow," said Father, in a real 

iM[' so-ci-e-ty tone. 
VUll, 1 iloD When Mary Frances went into the kitchen next 
J^lSirV ^ morning, she said:

1. Pick over the rice, and wash by putting in a strainer and shak-

2. Butter the baking dish. 

3. Stir rice, sugar and salt into the milk. 

4. Pour into the baking dish. 

5. Sprinkle with nutmeg. 

6. Cover with a lid, and bake slowly 2 hours. 

7. Uncover and brown i hour. 

Note. — Seeded raisins may be added before browning. If desired, a 
thin narrow shaving of the outside rind of a lemon may be used as flavoring. 
Put this in the milk with the rice. 

*'Why, thank you, Baking Dish," exclaimed Mary 
Frances. "Will you kindly say it over slowly? I'll 
do it then, keeping time with your directions.'' 

This he did, and as Mary Frances slipped him into' 
the oven, "I'm sure this will be good," he said; "I 
can always tell." 

*'I'm very glad," said Mary Frances, gratefully. 

"Now for the Boiled Mutton," she said. "I guess, 
Iron Pot, you can tell me about that." 





Slipped Kim into the oven.

''Yes, ma'am/' said Iron Pot, importantly climbing 
from the shelf, and eying critically the piece of meat 
Mary Frances had placed on the table. 

''That's a pretty nice cut of meat — pretty nice. 
It will be all right to cook it as I will tell you. But, 
really, mutton is less greasy if it is boiled long enough 
before needed to let the gravy cool. Take off the cake 
of fat which will form on the top when cold. Of 
course, take the meat out as soon as it is tender, and 
after 'skimming' the gravy, put it in again to re-heat." 

"I haven't time!" said Mary Frances, anxiously. 

"You can put yours in a bowl, and stand the bowl 
in ice water to cool the liquor quickly, and do the same 
thing that way, now " 

"You give the recipe?" asked Mary Frances. 

Iron Pot looked pleased, and began: 

No. 25. — Boiled Mutton. 

About 3 pounds rack of mutton or "yearling." 

1. Wipe with a damp cloth. 

2. Pour 3 cups boiling water into a large pot. 

3. Throw in 2 peeled onions. 
4; Put in the meat. Cover. 
5. Boil 10 minutes.

6. Draw pot to back of stove where it will simmer, or just bubble, 

until meat is tender when tried with a fork, which will be 
in abcut 1| hours. 

7. Take out the meat. 

8. Skim off the fat from the surface of the liquor; or if there is 

time, cool, and remove the hardened fat. 

'^ Correct!" exclaimed Sauce Pan, bending over 
Mary Frances' book. '^And the gravy is made " 

''Saucy!" began Iron Pot, in a boiling rage; but 
he suddenly stopped, as Mary Frances shook her finger 
at him. 

"It's all right this time," she said. 

''It is your place. Sauce Pan " 

"It is my place," said Sauce Pan, trying not to let 
Iron Pot see how pleased he was to tell about 

No. 26. — Sauce or Gravy for Boiled Mutton. 

1. After cooling and skimming off the fat, measure the water in 

which the meat was boiled. 

2. To each cupful, allow 

1 tablespoon flour, | teaspoon salt, | teaspoon vinegar. 

3. Moisten these with a little cold water. 

4. Stir them into the boiling gravy. 

5. Add 1 tablespoon finely minced parsley.

''Thank you both, my friends," said Mary Frances, 
lifting Iron Pot. 

"My, but you're heavy!" 

" 'Tis true," said Iron Pot, sadly, "all my old- 
fashioned friends, like Iron Tea Kettle — glancing toward 
the new Tea Kettle — and Caldron, are gone. But," 
he added, brightening up, "it has been proved that 
for boiling meats, no modern 'light-weights' could 'do 
them up so brown!'" 

"We'll prove it again," laughed Mary Frances. 
"I do believe I'll have a splendid lunch for Father — a 
regular big man's lunch. Listen!

"And now I'll set the table! I think I'U use the 
very best silver, and the prettiest dishes — it will please

This is the way Mary Frances set the table for her 
father and Billy's lunch. Mary Frances sat in her 
mother's place.

Just as Mary Frances was finishing getting the

This is what Mary Frances heard: 
"Hello!" 



^Yes!" 



Too bad, Father, can't you?" 




'^Well, I'll tell her, but I hate to, awfuUy. She's 
been hard at work all the morning." 



"I? — Oh, I attended to the fire for her, then went 
upstairs to make those drawings." 



Oh, yes; I'll look after her, all right." 



'Yes, she is — a regular 'brick!'" 



'All right. Good-bye!"

'^Oh, I say, Sister," said Billy; "I'll pretend I'm 
Father — won't that do? And — oh, yes! I'll show you 
how to fold a napkin into 'Cinderella's shpper!'" 

"Where did you learn how?" Mary Frances began 
to dry her tears. 

"Not on land, and not on sea 
Did this knowledge come to me. 
When I learned, I had on my hat — 
Where was I ? Now, riddle me that ? 

No, lady fair, not up in the air — 
On a boat in the river." 

"Silly Billy!" exclaimed Mary Frances. "Please Oh deaf! 
show me the trick now, will you ? " 0\\ 




Yes," said Billy, "and then I'll eat Father's 
share, as well as mine, of a very 'grand' lunch — if my 
nose isn't deceiving me." 

"Well," said Mary Frances, "that will help some; 
but please fold the napkin." 

And Billy showed her this:

Mary Frances was so pleased with the Cinderella's 
slipper that she folded all the napkins on the lunch 
table, 

''Looks like a hotel table," said Billy. 

"Well, Billy," said Mary Frances, "I know fancy 
folded napkins aren't so nice for home — but you don't 
mind." 

''Indeed, no," said Billy; "I feel proud." 

While they were at lunch there came a knock and 
a boy from the store handed in a box of candy and a 
little note addressed to 

Miss Mary Frances. 

"Ahem," said Billy, as Mary Frances opened the 
box, and offered him some candy "since Father couldn't 
come, he sent a sweet guest in his place." 

"It isn't very nice to eat up your guest," laughed 
Mary Frances. 

"Mary Frances," asked Billy, "what's better than 
a cream chocolate?" 

"Two cream chocolates, I guess," said Mary Fran- 
ces, passing the box — "but, Billy, listen:

'^ to-day's lesson is so easy I think it 
would be just the time to invite Eleanor over for her

^'I do wonder whether the Kitchen People will talk 
and help us — or whether they can help but one person. 
It would be pretty hard without their help; but let 
me read the recipe again: 

No. 27. — Apple Snow. 

1. Pare and slice apples, dropping into cold water. 

2. Cook slowly until soft. 

3. Mash well and measure. 

4. To every cupful, allow

white of 1 egg, well beaten. 

5. Add a spoonful of each to apples until used, stirring in lightly 

each time. 

6. Add 1 drop vanilla for each cup of apples.

But some one was talking. 

'^ Wonder what little Mistress will cook to-day." 

"I'll see if they know/' said Mary Frances to 
herself. 

"It's hard to remember so far ahead/' complained 
Coffee Pot. "I wish it was my turn all the time." 

"Oh, you have more chance than most of us, except 
Tea Kettle/' exclaimed Sauce Pan. "I expect, though, 
most of us will be used a lot now," — airily. 

"Why?" 

"Oh, I read a poem about it, which proves "

''If that isn't too silly for anything in the

It was a new voice, Mary Frances peeped out. 
Big Blue Pitcher was near the edge of the shelf. 

"It's perfectly true, though," re-tort-ed Sauce Pan, 
angrily. 

"There! There!" said Aunty Rolling Pin, sooth- 
ingly; "don't get so excited! Of course it's true." 

"You bet it's true and I can prove " 

"Oh, my ear!" cried Blue Pitcher, toppling 
dangerously near the edge of the shelf. "Prove it! XJl^LiJ^'^^

They kept up this chant until Mary Frances stepped

'^Why did-de-dieV^ demanded Mary Frances, but 
not a word was answered. 

''What will Mother say?" she said, sweeping up the 
broken pieces of poor Blue Pitcher. ''Won't she be sorry !" 

"Yes, she will!" said Sauce Pan; "but it was his 
own fault! I think Jubey'll be sorrier! She thought 
Blue Pitcher one of her best friends. They were very 
con-fi-dent-ial. Only yesterday I heard her telling 
him that always after eating a hearty meal for which 
she had no appetite, she felt hungry." 

"What did Blue Pitcher say?" asked Aunty 
Rolling Pin. 

"Never paid any 'tention — just said: 'Humph, 
Jubey, I know where a lot of cat-tails grow!' 

"'You do, do you?' said Jubey. 'I'd like to know.' 

'"On little kittens!' said Blue Pitcher." 

The Kitchen People laughed.

light, delicious dessert. Then, ''Mary Frances, I 
know; I'm going to ask my mother for a cook book! 
I wonder if you'll let me borrow yours some time to

"Of course!" laughed Mary Frances. 

Just then there was a ring at the door-bell. 

In came Aunt Maria with a mysterious looking 
bundle. 

"Why, my dear, you have company, I see," said 
the old lady with a smile. 

"Yes, ma'am," said Eleanor, "Mary Frances 
has been giving me a cooking lesson." 

Mary Frances shook her head and put her finger 
to her mouth, but Eleanor didn't understand. 

"A cooking lesson!" exclaimed Aunt Maria. 
"A cooking lesson! Mary Frances! A cooking

Then she began to laugh.

'^Mary Frances, dear," she said, at length, "1 heard 
about the lovely things you made Mary Ann Hooper; 
and I found out, too, by wheedlin ' it out of her, about 
the cooking lessons — and here's a surprise for you," 
and she handed the bundle to the little girl. 

^^Oh, Aunt Maria!" cried Mary Frances unwrap-

"To wear at your cooking lessons," fluttered Aunt 
Maria. 

" How dear and lovely ! (Trying them on.) " Look, 
Eleanor, they just fit!" 

"You're the happiest girl in the world!" sighed 
Eleanor. 

"I should be, if Mother were really well," said 
Mary Frances; "but she's much better, and is coming 
home soon. Aunt Maria," she added, — "oh, I want

made for our lesson, I mean?" 

"I'd ap-pre-ci-ate the kindness," said the old lady 
a little stiffly, as though a bit ashamed of her softness 
,a moment ago. But after tasting the treat, she said: 

"It's the most beautiful snow I ever saw, little

op-ment of char-ac-ter — whatever that is. It seemed 
to have something to do with cooking, for at the same 
time, she told about the things our little Miss had 
made, and seemed so proud. 

'"May I see your book, my dear?' she asked Mary

Mary Frances showed her: 

'''Candy!' she exclaimed, 'Why, to-morrow, my 
dear (she never used to call her my dear), you can 
have a Candy Pull — only,' she laughed, 'it isn't the 
kind that is pulled.' 

'"Oh, Aunt Maria,' said Mary Frances, 'that's 
the loveliest thought — the Candy Pull, I mean.'" 

"Humph," said Sauce Pan, "I don't think so! 
That means we can't help her." 

"Oh, no, it doesn't," said Aunty Rolling Pin. 
"We can help her a great deal by just doing our part. 
Don't you see? She doesn't need us as she used

the boys are up in Billy's den ! So we'll read the recipes 
over first thing, and get started soon as possible." 

'' Do read them, Mary Frances, "said Eleanor. '' I'm so 
anxious — I'm just 'crazy 'to learn how to make them." 

''Well," said Mary Frances, "the first is 'Picka- 
ninny Fudge!' Isn't that just like Mother! — to call 
Chocolate Fudge that cute name!" 

"Hurry, Mary Frances; do read it," cried Eleanor, 
delighted. 

Mary Frances read: 

No. 29. — Pickaninny Fudge. 

2 cups sugar 2 tablespoons butter 

1 cup milk 4 squares chocolate (4 ounces) 

5 drops vanilla 

1. Put sugar, milk, chocolate and butter together in a pan. 

2. Boil until a few drops harden when dropped into cold water. 

3. Butter a platter. 

4. Add vanilla to candy and stir while it cools. 

5. Cut into squares with a buttered knife while still soft. 

"That just makes my 'mouth water,' Mary 
Frances," said Eleanor. "If the next is as good as 
that !" 

"It is!" declared Mary Frances. "Listen!

4. Butter a platter. 

5. Drop by tablespoonfuls on the platter. 

6. Put a half walnut on each little mound or "kiss." 

"These are 'grand/ " said Mary Frances. ''Mother 
made some just before she was ill." 

"But have you the walnuts?" asked Eleanor, 
anxiously. 

"Yes," explained Mary Frances. "Aunt Maria 
saw these recipes yesterday at the picnic, and she 
brought over a lot of walnuts ready for us. If she 
hadn't, I'd never have thought of them, I guess." 

"Now — to work! You can make the Walnut 
Kisses — if you like." 

"If you'll explain it all to me," said Eleanor.

The little girls worked pretty quietly until they 
were ready to pour out the candy. 

''How are you getting along, children?" inquired 
Aunt Maria at the door. 

"Oh, Aunty, I'm so glad you came" said Mary 
Frances; "we were just a little afraid — without help." 

"Yes, I see," said Aunt Maria; "you might easily 

be burned. This is perfect so far. "Now " and 

she showed the children how to pour out the candy. 

("Almost as well as the Kitchen People could," 
thought Mary Frances.) 

"Walnut Kisses," said her father, kissing Mary

Mary Frances tied on her new apron

'^Fly time is nearly gone," said Sauce Pan, "and — 
school time is almost here," he added, seeing Mary 
Frances didn't seem to notice. 

"Yes," she said, "but before school time, there's a 
grand good time — Mother comes home to-morrow!" 

"Whew!" whistled Tea Kettle. "So soon?" 

"Well," said Mary Frances, "it doesn't seem soon 
when I think of it without my cooking lessons — but 
when I think I'm nearly through the book " 

"What's to-day's lesson?" asked Aimty Rolling 
Pin. "I'm so anxious you do get through!" 

"Thank you. Aunty Rolling Pin, I must tell you. 
I'm going to give a Tea Party!" 

"A Tea Party!" exclaimed Tea Pot, clapping his 
lid up and down. "Oh, lovely!" 

"Oh, this is a Tea Party without tea," said Mary

Then, seeing how disappointed Tea Pot looked: 
''Oh, I will have tea, too. Aunt Maria without 

tea! That will never do!" 
"Now for the next recipe:

3. Add the boiling water slowly. 

4. Add remaining sugar, and the flavoring. 

5. Sift together twice flour, baking powder and salt. 

6. Sift by small quantities into the mixture, beating well each

"No," explained Mary Frances, '^I 'spose Mother 
intended to show me about that." 

"Of course, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin, "that 
was it. Now, I'll tell you all about cake " 

"What's that!" a queer, muffled voice. 

Mary Frances started in surprise. 

A great com-mo-tioninside the pantry, and the 
sound of many little voices! Then she made out the 
words : 

"Get out of my way! Here, you, step aside!" 
(Then a little shriek or two followed by the sound of 
falling tins.) "Oh, you knocked my nose. There! 
that makes the fiftieth dent! No wonder I look old 
and worn out. Can't you wait a minute?" 

At length there came a pounding on the door, and 
a high little voice — or was it two voices? 

"Let me out! Oh, I say, please let us out!" 

"Mercy!" thought Mary Frances, "I hope there 
isn't going to be any trouble." And she cautiously 
opened the pantry door a little way. The two Cake 
Tins pushed their way out.

"Oh, thank you!" they said, breathlessly, in chorus 
(looking at each other all the while as though they'd 
learned and rehearsed every word). '^I thought I'd 
never get out to help! I've listened through the door 
to every lesson, just hoping my turn would come. 
There I was back of the other pots and pans, and when 
I heard 'Cake' I just jumped!" 

''As I had just started to say" — Aunty Rolling 
Pin began. 

"What do you know about cakes!" cried the 
Cake Tins, angrily. "If everybody'd just mind his 
own cooking — who ever rolls cakes?" 

"Well, I know about cookies," said Aunty Rolling 
Pin; "and besides, I know about most things, — I 
belonged to a real cooking teacher!" 

"Prove it!" cried the Cake Tins. 

"I will," said Aunty Rolling Pin; "here's part of a 
lecture the teacher used to give:

"Humph!" said Square Cake Tin, "I don't see 
that that proves you know anything about cake. Now 
I'll explain: 

"There are really only two kinds of cake in general: 

"1. Cakes without butter, or some form of sponge

''We'll both be used!" exclaimed the Cake Pans, 
joyously. ''I told you so! I told you!" they cried at 
each other as though having an argument. 

"Come/' said Mary Frances, "less talking. We 
must get to work." 

"Look at the oven first," said the Cake Pans, as 
Mary Frances started to break the eggs. 

"Is it right?" asked the little girl, lifting them up 
to see. 

"Yes," they said, "it will be just right when we 
are ready." 

"All the ma-ter-i-als you'll need ready?" asked 
Round Cake Tin after a minute. 

"Yes," looking over the table, "I see — everything. 
Good!" 

"I brought the butter into the warm room an hour 
ago," said Mary Frances, "so that it would be softened 
by the time I needed it. I'll make the sponge cake 
first, as the oven will be cooler then." 

"Right!" cried the Cake Tins; "but when you 
open the oven door, be careful to do so gently, as any 
jarring will break the 'gas bubbles' very easily, doing 
much more harm toward making the cake heavy than

With the Cake Tins' help, a warm and tired, but 
very happy little girl brought two golden brown fragrant 
cakes to the table one-half hour before lunch time. 

''Turn us on our sides," panted the Cake Tins, ''to 
let us cool off quickly and evenly. My, but it was warm 
in there!" 

"How beautiful the cakes look!" said Mary 
Frances, doing as she was told. 

"Why not take a taste?" Square Cake Tin asked.

"What's the matter, child?" asked Aunt 
Maria, anxiously. " ^ Homesick ' for Mother? 
— or was to-day's lesson too hard?" 

Then^ Mary Frances told of cutting and eating the 
fresh cake. "And, Aunt Maria," she said, the tears 
flowing down her cheeks, "it went down!

down! 

until I was afraid it would rise out of the bottom of 
the pan the other way." 

"Never mind, dear child," Aunt Maria comforted 
her. "I did the same thing to my first cake. I remem- 
ber it well!" 

"You did. Aunt Maria?" 

"Yes," said the old lady. "I'll tell you what we'll 
do! I'll bake a cake in place of yours for to-night's 
party. Don't tell any one."

''Oh, thank you, Aunt Maria," cried Mary Frances; 
''that's so kind!" 

"Not a word to any one!" cau-tion-ed Aunt Maria. 
"What else do you have?" 

"Cocoa," said Mary Frances; "I can make that." 

"My," smiled Aunt Maria, "I'm so proud." 

After the games and riddles, Mary Frances excused 
herself from her guests, and made the cocoa and the 
pot of tea for her aunt. Then Billy carried in the tray, 
on which she had placed the cake, and the cups and 
saucers, plates, napkins, and Chocolate Pot, and, oh, 
yes. Tea Pot, for Aunt Maria; and she poured the cocoa 
like a real grown lady, while the boys passed the plates 
and the cake, and served the guests to the cups of cocoa. 

"Did Mary Frances make this cake?" asked one 
of the guests. ("Fm awfully glad she didn't ask about 
the other," thought the little girl.) 

"Yes," said Eleanor's brother Bob. "Yes; know- 
ing the greatness of the present oc-ca-sion, I have 
written a poem, en-ti-tled, 'Ode to the Cook' (bowing 
to Mary Frances), which, with your kind indulgence, I 
will now read:"

"Begin!" laughed Mary Frances. 
Bob cleared his throat and began: 

"Mary Frances is a girl 

Who cooks for you and I; 
She can boil a fancy cake 
Or stew a cherry pie. 

" Once she made a pot of soup 
And served it for our dinner; 
We thought that we were like to die, 
It made us so much thinner." 

*'Time to weep?" asked Billy, pa-thet-i-cal-ly. 

"Now, this, our cook will save expense, 
For when she is your baker. 
You may save your doctor's bill — 
Just get an undertaker." 

"Now, Billy," cried Mary Frances, "what have 
you been telling?" 

"Oh, Bob, I say " said Billy. 

"Mary Frances, don't mind Bob," interrupted

Eleanor. ''You see what I have to stand all the time.'' 
And Mary Frances laughed heartily. 

''Did you think I minded Bob?" she asked. 

"Show you forgive me, Mary Frances," begged 
Bob, "by letting me have another cup of cake, and 
another piece of cocoa." 

"Not another,''^ laughingly corrected Mary Frances, 
"To be polite, I believe I must pretend I didn't notice 
you'd had any." 

"You certainly are kind, Mary Frances," said Bob, 
"when I don't know how many pieces " 

"I know," cried Eleanor,^" this makes the fifth!" 

"Well, Nell," begged Bob, "don't tell Mother." 

"You deserve it," said Eleanor. 

"Come," said Billy, "all ready! another game! 
'Blind feeds Blind!'" And they blindfolded the boys' 
eyes, and sat them opposite each other, each with a 
plate of little pieces of cake, and a spoon. They were 
to try to feed each other. The one who dropped the _^.. 

least number of pieces, and whose cake was first gone, M nt uPr 
won. It was very funny! Sometimes the spoon was 
poked into the other boy's ear; sometimes it hit his 
nose.

"Everything was grand, Mary Frances," said 
Eleanor, "and it was the loveliest party!" 

"I think so, too," smiled Aunt Maria. 

"One last riddle," said Mary Frances' father, 
bidding the young people good-night: 

"^Why is Mary Frances the happiest girl in the 
world?' " 

Then they all guessed 

"Because 'Mother' is coming home to-morrow!" 

"Oh, Mary Frances," laughed Eleanor, "I've had 
more fun! Good-night, dear." And "So have we all 
of us," and "Thank you," cried the others. 
"Good-night!"

I don't know whether I'm myself or not!" 
''You are!" solemnly declared Sauce 
Pan, — ''I mean you are our little 'Miss' — Miss Mary 
Frances." 

"My, I feel so relieved!" said Mary Frances. 
"Since that is so, I'll tell you why I'm so excited! 
Mother is coming home to-day — and — I'm going to 
get dinner. Isn't it lovely?" 

"Everybody," shouted Tea Kettle, "ready!" 

With that, every utensil in the kitchen sprang to its 
queer little feet. 

"We're all quite ready, Mistress," said Tea Kettle, 
trying to make a bow, but looking very clumsy and 
ri-dic-u-lous, trying at the same time to keep water 
from spilling out of his nose. 

"Thank you, everybody," said Mary Frances, 
very gravely, however. "I'll not need anyone just now 
but Aunty Rolling Pin. Where is she?"

"She's out picking cherries to make a pumpkin 
pie," said Sauce Pan in a loud whisper to Pie Plate. 

"Here I am, child," Aunty Rolling Pin's voice 
answered. "I can't seem to roll out. Get out of my 
way — you!" 

With that, Knife, Fork and Spoon slid to the side 
of the table, and she rolled to the edge. 

"What is it, child?" she smiled. 

"It's the grandest thing!" said Mary Frances. 

No. 33. — Queen of Hearts Tarts. 

Spread cooked heart-shaped pastry shells with preserved 
cherries. See No. 34. 

"Tarts!" chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin. "Oh, my 
handles! I'm so happy! Are the cherries ready, 
child?" she asked, anxiously. 

"Yes," said Mary Frances, "I am to use 

No. 34. — Pastry. 
1 cup flour I cup lard

(Use as little water as possible.) 

1. Sift salt and flour into a bowl. 

2. Rub lard into flour with finger tips until like coarse powder

3. Add half the cold water, stirring with a knife to form a stiff 

ball. Keep this on one side of the bowl. 

4. Stir in more water until the remaining flour forms a ball. Press 

these balls together. 

5. Roll out. Fit to pie plate. Trim off overhanging edges. 

6. Bake in a hot oven. 



"That's it!" exclaimed Aunty Rolling Pin, joyously. 
"I was afraid there might not be 'shortening' or lard 
enough in the recipe. The whole art of making good 
pastry is in having one-third as much lard as flour, 
and using as little water as possible. 

"I was afraid, too, that your mother would not put 
'pastry' in the book, for when flour or starch grains 
are coated in fat they are too dry to 'swell' well in 
cooking, and cannot burst open. They are not, I'm 
sorry to say, a very di-ges-ti-ble food." 

"I'm glad she did, though," said Mary Frances; 
"she will not often let us eat 'pastry,' but I 'spect she 
im-ag-ined how pleased I'd be. I wonder why pie tastes 
so good, if it isn't good for us? My, how much I have 
to do! Now I'm ready!" 

At these words, Middle-sized Bowl sprang upon 
the table.

"Is the salt in the flour?" asked Aunty Rolling 
Pin, crit-i-cal-ly. 

"Yes, ma'am," said Tea Spoon, "I put it in." 

"Who'll measure the lard?" asked Mary Frances. 

"I will!" and Measuring Cup threw it into Bowl. 

"Well," laughed Mary Frances, "and what do 
I do?" 

"You'll do enough, child," said Aunty Rolling Pin, 
"before you get ready a whole big dinner, even with 
our help."

it! Now, rub them together until it seems like coarse 
powder. You could use a knife instead, chopping the 
lard all through." 

"That right?" asked Mary Frances, holding some

couldn't see over the edge of Bowl. 

''Yes, that is right," she answered. ''Now, you 
may use a knife for stirring and pour just a httle water 
in — oh, mercy! child! (as Mary Frances was about 
to throw in a quarter of a glass) not that way! Make 
a httle 'weir in the flour. Pour in about one table- 
spoon of water. Mix well. Let that rest at one side 
and do the same thing in another place, and then 
another, finally stirring all together into one big ball. 

"That's just right!" as Mary Frances Hfted up the 
paste. 

"Now, sift a little flour on the board and — oh, how 
many tarts are you going to make?" 

"Six." 

"All right. Cut the paste into five even pieces, and 
with me (Mary Frances laughed. Aunty Rolling Pin 
seemed so pleased) roll out each piece about one-eighth 
of an inch thick. After cutting out, save all the left- 
over trimmings to use for the last one. Plates ready?" 

"All ready!" answered the Httle heart-shaped 
Tart Plates.

Frances, cutting the trimmings from the edge of 
Tart Plate with a knife held upright along the edge. 

Fork came dancing from the edge of the table. 

"Oh, I remember!" said Mary Frances, pressing 
the prongs into the outer edge of the crust. 

"They^re grand!" chuckled Aunty Rolling Pin. 
''Can you bake them? You need a very hot oven to 
bake them." 

"But the cherries!" said Mary Frances, glad to 
think she had caught Aunty Rolling Pin in an over- 
sight. 

"Not until the pastry's cooked, child," said Aunty 
Rolling Pin, with a smile. 

Mary Frances slipped the little plates into the oven, 
and made room on the table to place the dinner as she 
prepared it. 

In a short fifteen minutes the tarts were ready. 

"Aren't they sweet!" the little girl exclaimed. 
"My! I wish they were thought to be very good for 
children!" 

"What's for dinner?" asked Tea Kettle, anxiously.

''Very elegant! — but that's a lot to do, isn't it?" 
said Tea Kettle. ''Perhaps, if you read over all the 
new recipes, and we talk them over when its each one's 
turn to commence, we can work better." 

"Oh, thank you. Tea Kettle," said Mary Frances, 
"that is a very bright idea." Tea Kettle ghstened. 

"I'll read them," continued Mary Frances, "as 
they come in the book." 

"I have the lettuce well washed, and the tomatoes

it, and make the pudding better." 

"To save a yolk, all you have to do (it was little 
Egg Beater) is to drop it into a cup and pour a little 
cold water over the top, to prevent its drying. You 
can use it next day, if you keep it cool."

All the Kitchen People smiled happily. 

"Is that the last recipe?" asked Frying Pan. 

"No," said Mary Frances. "Why, who are you?" 

"I'm Frying Pan, of the great Pan family, if you

That'^

''That's it!" cried Frying Pan, delighted. "That's 
as good as broihng, though it took people a long time 
to find it out." 

''It is not!" cried Gridiron Broiler angrily clicking 
his wires. "It is not, Spider!" 

"For shame!" said Mary Frances. "Don't call 
names!" 

"He isn't calling names," answered Frying Pan, 
"that's my other name, Frying Pan Spider." 

Then to Gridiron he added, "Come, don't let's 
quarrel, you'll admit pan-broiling is very nearly as 
good for chops as broiling over the coals in a broiler, 
and quite as good for steaks — nearly." 

"I was just getting ready to say," said Gridiron, 
you didn't mean 'quite.'" 

"It's time to commence!" loudly struck in Mantel 
Clock. 

And then Mary Frances looked on in amazement. 

In walked Basket with the potatoes for the potato

is to make the new recipes — with our help," which 
Mary Frances did. 

Whenever she'd make a mistake, some one of the 
Kitchen People would correct and help her. 

At six o'clock all the dinner was ready to serve, 
and the table was set. 

"Oh, thank you, dear Kitchen People," said the 
beaming little girl; 'Hhis is the happiest time of my

CHAPTER XXVI 



MOTHER S SURPRISE 

AFTER one last look, Mary Frances, hearing 
the sound of carriage wheels, ran to answer 
the door before the bell rang; but Billy 
was there, too, and they opened the door 
together. 

"Oh, Mother!" cried Mary Frances; "you dear, 
darhng Mother! What a 'cry-baby' I am!" (as the 
tears rolled down her cheeks, and Mother kissed her 
and Billy and Father again and again) "What a 'cry- 
baby!'" 

"Which she is not!" declared Billy. "Tell Mother, 
— Mary Frances, I can't wait for you to tell your 
secret!" 

"A secret?" smiled Mother. "A secret, Mary 
Frances?" 

"Oh, how good something smells!" said Mother. 
"It makes me hungry." 

"Come right out, then," said Mary Frances, bow- 
ing, "Dinner is Served."

''Here?" asked her mother. ''I im-ag-ined we'd 
go over to Aunt Maria's." 

''No, Mother, dear," laughed Mary Frances, hap- 
pily; "it's the 'surprise' for you." And they went 
into the dining-room. 

"Wh — wh — why! how did this happen?" asked 
Mother. "Where did this feast come from?" 

Everybody laughed and talked at the same time. 

"Mary Frances is guilty," laughed Billy; and Mary 
Frances "owned up." 

"Mother," said she, bringing her worn and some- 
what soiled little cook book and putting it in her 
Mother's lap, "I've made everything! I've gone 'all 
through' my book! I got dinner to-night! — that's 
your surprise." 
'*HnW {\i(\ " ^^ ^^^ ^^^^' lovely child !" said Mother. "You

^ in her lap, she hugged and kissed her again and again. 



"I'm awfully sorry I couldn't exactly explain about

Frances, going out to bid them good-night. "If it

liadn't been for you, I never, never could have done it, 
— my dear, dear, friends." 

"You'll not need us soon again," said Tea Kettle, 
sadly. "We're sorry — yet we're glad that your 
mother will take our place as teacher now." 

"Will you help me when I do need you?" asked 
Mary Frances. 

"When you do," they promised, and she threw them 
a kiss. 

"Good-night, little Miss," they cried; and when 
she turned round again, they looked just like any 
or-din-arj^ kitchen utensils. 

For a minute she felt very lonely; then, remem- 
bering, she said gladly, "But they promised!"
