Sauces 

There is a certain philosophy of the 
sauces, which, when understood, en- 
ables one to make quite a variety from 
the materials usually found in every 
household. 

The measurements, as given here, 
are rounded as much above as below 
the spoon. If, however, level meas- 
urements are easier, allow two tea- 
spoonfuls or two tablespoonfuls for 
each one given in these recipes.

tomatoes, and bring to a boil. Add a 
half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of 
Cayenne. Strain. Stir until boiling, 
strain again and add four tablespoon- 
fuls of Sherry. 



Cooking of Eggs 

Any single food containing all the 
elements necessary to supply the re- 
quirements of the body is called a 
complete or typical food. Milk and 
eggs are frequently so called, because 
they sustain the young animals of their 
kind during a period of rapid growth. 
Nevertheless, neither of these foods 
forms a perfect diet for the human 
adult. Both are highly nutritious, but 
incomplete. 

Served with bread or rice, they 
form an admirable meal and one that 
is nutritious and easily digested. The 
white of eggs, almost pure albumin, 
is nutritious, and, when cooked in 
water at 170° Fahrenheit, requires 



14 MANY WAYS FOR 

less time for perfect digestion than a 
raw egg. The white of a hard-boiled 
egg is tough and quite insoluble. The 
yolk, however, if the boiling has been 
done carefully for twenty minutes, is 
mealy and easily digested. Fried 
eggs, no matter what fat is used, are 
hard, tough and insoluble. The yolk 
of an egg cooks at a lower tempera- 
ture than the white, and for this reason 
an egg should not be boiled unless the 
yolk alone is to be used. 

Ten eggs are supposed to weigh a 
pound, and, unless they are unusually 
large or small, this is quite correct. 

Eggs contain from 72 to 84 per cent, 
of water, about 12 to 14 per cent, of 
albuminates. The yolk is quite rich in 
fat; the white deficient. They also 
contain mineral matter and extractives. 



COOKING EGGS 1 5 

To ascertain the freshness of an egg 
without breaking it, hold your hand 
around the egg toward a bright light 
or the sun and look through it. 
If the yolk appears quite round and 
the white clear, it is fresh. Or, if you 
put it in a bucket of water and it falls 
on its side, it is fresh. If it sort of 
topples in the water, standing on its 
end, it is fairly fresh, but, if it floats, 
beware of it. The shell of a fresh egg 
looks dull and porous. As it begins to 
age, the shell takes on a shiny appear- 
ance. If an egg is kept any length of 
time, a portion of its water evaporates, 
which leaves a space in the shell, and 
the egg will "rattle." An egg that 
rattles may be perfectly good, and still 
not absolutely fresh. 



1 6 MANY WAYS FOR 

TO PRESERVE EGGS 

To preserve eggs it is only neces- 
sary to close the pores of the shells. 
This may be done by dipping them in 
melted paraffine, or packing them in 
salt, small ends down; or pack them 
in a keg and cover them with brine; 
or pack them in a keg, small ends 
down and cover them with lime water ; 
this not only protects them from the 
air, but acts as a germicide. 

Eggs should not be packed for win- 
ter use later than the middle of May 
or earlier than the first of April. 
Where large quantities of the yolks 
are used, the whites may be evaporated 
and kept in glass bottles or jars. 
Spread them out on a stoneware or 
granite plate and allow them to evapor- 
ate at the mouth of a cool oven. When 



COOKING EGGS 1 7 

the mixture is perfectly dry, put it 
away. This powder is capable of tak- 
ing up the same amount of water that 
has been evaporated from it, and may 
then be used the same as fresh whites. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Cover the bottoms of individual 
dishes with a little butter and a few 
fresh bread crumbs; drop into each 
dish two fresh eggs; stand this dish in 
a pan of hot water and cook in the 
oven until the whites are set. Put a 
tiny bit of butter in the middle of each, 
and a dusting of salt and pepper. 

EGGS MEXICANA 
Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in 
a saucepan. Add four tablespoonfuls 
of finely chopped onion and shake until 



l8 MANY WAYS FOR 

the onion is soft, but not brown. 
Then add four Spanish peppers cut 
in strips, a dash of red pepper and a 
half pint of tomatoes; the tomatoes 
should be in rather solid pieces. Add 
a seasoning of pepper and salt. Let 
this cook slowly while you shir the 
desired quantity of eggs. When the 
eggs are ready to serve, put two table- 
spoonfuls of this sauce at each side of 
the dish, and send at once to the table. 

EGGS ON A PLATE 

Rub the bottom of a baking dish 
with butter. Dust it lightly with salt 
and pepper. Break in as many fresh 
eggs as required. Stand the dish in a 
basin of water and cook in the oven 
five minutes, or until the whites are set. 
While these are cooking, put two 



COOKING EGGS I9 

tablespoonfuls of butter in a pan and 
shake over the fire until it browns. 
When the eggs are done, baste them 
with the browned butter, and send to 
the table. 

EGGS DE LESSEPS 

Shir the eggs as directed. Have 
ready, carefully boiled, two sets of 
calves' brains; cut them into slices; 
put two or three slices between the 
eggs, and then pour over browned but- 
ter. 

EGGS MEYERBEER 
To each half dozen eggs allow three 
lambs' kidneys. Broil the kidneys. 
Shir the eggs as directed in the first 
recipe. When done, put half a kidney 
on each side of the plate, and pour over 
Sauce Perigueux. 



20 MANY WAYS FOR 

EGG TIMBALES 

Butter small timbale moulds or cus- 
tard cups, dust the bottoms and sides 
with chopped tongue and finely chopped 
mushrooms. Break into each mould 
one fresh egg. Stand the mould in a 
baking-pan half filled with boiling 
water, and cook in the oven until the 
eggs are set. Have ready nicely 
toasted rounds of bread, one for each 
cup, and a well-made tomato or cream 
sauce. Loosen the eggs from the cups 
with a knife, turn each out onto a 
round of toast, arrange neatly on a 
heated platter, fill the bottom of the 
platter with cream or tomato sauce, 
garnish the dish with nicely seasoned 
green peas and serve at once. 



COOKING EGGS 21 

EGGS COQUILLICOT 

Grease small custard or timbale cups 
and put inside of each a cooked Span- 
ish pepper. Drop in the pepper one 
egg. Dust it lightly with salt, stand 
the cups in a pan of boiling water and 
cook in the oven until the eggs are set. 
Toast one round of bread for each cup 
and make a half pint of cream sauce. 
When the eggs are set, fill the bottom 
of the serving platter with cream 
sauce, loosen the peppers from the cups 
and turn them out on the rounds of 
toast. Stand them in the cream sauce, 
dust on top of each a little chopped 
parsley and send to the table. 

EGGS SUZETTE 

Bake as many potatoes as you have 
persons to serve. When done, cut 
off the sides, scoop out a portion of the 



22 MANY WAYS FOR 

potato, leaving a wall about a half inch 
thick. Mash the scooped-out portion, 
add to it a little hot milk, salt and 
pepper, and put it into a pastry bag. 
Put a little salt, pepper and butter into 
each potato and break in a fresh egg. 
Press the potato from the pastry bag 
through a star tube around the edge 
of the potato, forming a border. Stand 
these in a baking-pan and bake until 
the eggs are set. Put a tablespoonful 
of cream sauce in the centre of each, 
and send to the table. 

EGGS STEAMED IN THE SHELL 

Eggs put into hot water and kept 
away from the fire are much better 
than eggs actually boiled for only a 
short time. The greater the number 
of eggs to be cooked, the greater the 



COOKING EGGS 2^ 

amount of water that must be used. 
To cook four eggs, put them into a 
kettle, pour over them two quarts of 
water, cover the kettle and allow them 
to stand for ten minutes. Lift them 
from the water, put them into a large 
bowl, cover with boiling water, and 
send at once to the table. The whites 
will be coagulated, but should be soft 
and creamy, while the yolks will be 
perfectly cooked. If you should add 
six eggs to this volume of water, 
lengthen the time of standing. A 
single egg, dropped into a quart of 
water, must stand eight minutes. 

TO POACH EGGS 

Take for this a shallow frying pan, 
and partly fill it with boiling water. 
The eggs must be perfectly fresh. The 



24 MANY WAYS FOR 

white of an egg is sealed in a mem- 
brane which seems to lose its tenacity 
after the egg is three days old. Such 
^^ ^SSy when dropped into boiling 
water, spreads out; that is, it does not 
retain its shape. When ready to poach 
eggs, take the required number to the 
stove. The water must be boiling hot, 
but not actually bubbling. Break an 
egg into a saucer, slide it quickly into 
the water, and then another and an- 
other. Pull the pan to the side of the 
stove, where the water cannot possibly 
boil. With a tablespoon, baste the 
water over the yolks of the eggs, if 
they happen to be exposed. They 
must be entirely covered with a thin 
veil of the white. Have ready the de- 
sired quantity of toast on a heated plat- 
ter, lift each egg with a slice or skim- 



COOKING EGGS 25 

mer, trim off the ragged edges and slide 
them at once on the toast. Dust with 
salt and pepper and send to the table. 

EGGS MIRABEAU

top of each a poached tgg, pour over 
Sauce Perigueux, and send to the 
table. 

EGGS NORWEGIAN 

Cover rounds of toasted bread first 
with butter and then with anchovy- 
paste, put on top of each a poached

it with the eggs, pour over the sauce. 
Dust the dish with parsley, and send at 
once to the table. The edge of this 
dish may be garnished with broiled 
sardines or carefully broiled smoked 
salmon. 



COOKING EGGS 3 1 

TO HARD-BOIL EGGS 

Put the eggs in warm water, bring 
the water quickly to the boiHng point, 
then push the kettle to the back of the 
stove, where the water will remain at 
200° Fahrenheit, for twenty minutes. 
If these are to be used for made over 
dishes, throw them at once into cold 
water, remove the shells, or the yolks 
will lose their color. 

EGGS CREOLE 

Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and 
four of chopped onions into a sauce- 
pan, cook until the onion is soft, but 
not brown. Then add four peeled 
fresh tomatoes that have been cut into 
pieces, and three finely chopped green 
peppers. Cook this fifteen minutes, 
and add a level teaspoonful of 



32 MANY WAYS FOR

onions. Put them in a saucepan with 
two tablespoonfuls of butter. Stand 
over hot water and cook until the 
onions are soft. Add a teaspoonful of 
curry powder, a clove of garlic mashed, 
a saltspoonful of ground ginger, a 
half teaspoonful of salt and a table- 
spoonful of flour; mix thoroughly and 
add a half pint of water. Stir until 
boiling. Have ready six hard-boiled 
eggs, cut them into slices, arrange them 
over a dish of carefully boiled rice, on 



COOKING EGGS 33 

a hot platter, strain over the sauce, and 
send at once to the table. This dish is 
made more attractive by a garnish with 
sweet Spanish peppers, cut mto strips. 

EGGS BEAUREGARD

whites from the yolks. Put the yolks 
through a sieve. Put the whites either 
through a vegetable press, or chop 
them very fine. Make a half pint of 
cream sauce, season it and add the 
whites. Have ready a sufficient amount 
of toast, carefully buttered. Put this 
on a heated platter, cover over the 
cream sauce and the whites, dust the 
tops with the yolks, then with salt and 
pepper. Garnish the edge of the dish 
with finely chopped parsley, and send 
at once to the table. 



34 MANY WAYS FOR 

EGGS LAFAYETTE

bottom of the pan with a fork, while 
they are cooking. Serve with a garnish 
of broiled bacon and toast. 

BIRDS' NESTS

each person. Beat the whites to a stiff 
froth. Heap them into individual 
dishes, make a nest, or hole, in the 
centre. Drop into this a whole yolk. 
Stand the dish in a pan of water, cover, 
and cook in the oven about two or three 
minutes. Dust lightly with salt and 
pepper, put a tiny bit of butter in the 
centre of each, and send at once to the 
table. This is one of the most sightly 
of all egg dishes.

mushrooms, chopped fine, two level 
tablespoonfuls of flour and one cupful 
of stock. Stir until boiling. Add a 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, a half 
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful 
of pepper. Put a tablespoonful of this 
sauce in the bottom of individual cups. 
Break into each cup one egg. Pour 
over the remaining mixture. Stand 
the cups in a pan of hot water and" bake 
in a moderate oven about five minutes. 

OMELET 

A plain French omelet is, perhaps, 
one of the most difficult of all things 
to make ; that is, it is the most difficult 



48 MANY WAYS FOR 

to have well made in the ordinary pri- 
vate house. Failures come from beat- 
ing the eggs until they are too light, 
or having the butter too hot, or cook- 
ing the omelet too long before serving. 

In large families, where it is neces- 
sary to use a dozen eggs, the omelet 
will be better if made in two. A six 
egg omelet is quite easily handled. Do 
not use milk for an omelet ; it toughens 
the eggs while cooking. An omelet pan 
is a shallow frying pan. It should be 
kept especially for omelets. Each time 
it is used rub until dry, but do not 
wash. Dust it with salt and rub it 
with brown paper until perfectly clean. 

To make an omelet : First, put a 
tablespoonful of butter in the middle 
of the pan. Let it heat slowly. Break 
the eggs in a bowl, add a tablespoonful 



COOKING EGGS 49 

of water to each egg and give twelve 
good, vigorous beats. To each six eggs 
allow a saltspoonful of pepper, and, if 
you like, a tablespoonful of finely 
chopped parsley. Take the eggs, a 
limber knife and the salt to the stove. 
Draw the pan over the hottest part of 
the fire, turn in the eggs, and dust over 
a half teaspoonful of salt. Shake the 
pan so that the omelet moves and folds 
itself over each time you draw the pan 
towards you. Lift the edge of the 
omelet, allowing the thin, uncooked 
portion of the tgg to run underneath. 
Shake again, until the omelet is set. 
Have ready. heated a platter, fold over 
the omelet and turn it out. Garnish 
with parsley, and send to the table. 



50 MANY WAYS FOR

omelet, it may be converted into many, 
many kinds. 

OMELET WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS 

Make a plain omelet from six eggs, 
have ready a half pint of Cream Sauce, 
and either a can or a bundle of cooked 
asparagus. Cut off the tips, preserv- 
ing the lower portions for another dish.

Sauce, pour the rest of the Cream 
Sauce in the platter, not over the 
omelet. 

OMELET WITH GREEN PEAS 

Make a six egg omelet. Have ready

once to the table. If you like, you may 
pour over, also, a half pint of Cream 
Sauce. 

HAVANA OMELET

the eggs after they have been beaten 
with the water, and finish the same as 
a plain omelet. 

OMELET WITH CHEESE

mushrooms, sliced, a half cup of milk 
and a teaspoonful of salt into a sauce- 
pan. Cover and cook slightly for

rooms may be added, if desired. 

SWEET OMELETS 
OMELET A LA WASHINGTON 

Put three eggs into a bowl, and three 
into another bowl. Add three table- 
spoonfuls of water to each, and beat. 
Have two omelet pans, in which you 
have melted butter. Grate an apple

tablespoonfuls of jelly in a dish over 
hot water while you make the omelet. 
Proceed as for plain omelets. The 



COOKING EGGS 59 

one to which you have added the apple, 
turn out on a plate. Before folding the

Dust both with powdered sugar, and 
send at once to the table. 

OMELET WITH RUM 

Make a plain omelet with six eggs, 
turn it on a heated platter. Dust it 
with powdered sugar, and score it 
across the top wath a red-hot poker. 
Dip four lumps of sugar into Jamaica 
rum and put them on the platter. Put 
over the omelet four tablespoon fuls of 
rum; touch a match to it, and carry it 
to the table, burning. Baste the omelet 
with the rum until the alcohol is en- 
tirely burned off. 



66 MANY WAYS FOR 

SWISS SOUFFLE 

Allow one egg to each person. Have 
everything in readiness. The maras- 
chino cherries must be drained from the 
liquor. Separate the eggs. Beat the 
whites until they are stiff. Add a level 
tablespoonful of powdered sugar to each 
white, and beat until dry and glossy. 
Add the yolks of three eggs. Mix 
quickly. Add the grated rind of one 
lemon and a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. Heap this into individual dishes. 
Make a tiny little hole in the centre 
and put in a maraschino cherry, leaving 
the hole large enough to also hold a 
tablespoonful of the liquor when the 
omelet is ready to serve; dust it with 
powdered sugar, bake in a quick oven 
about three minutes, take it from the 
oven, pour in the maraschino juice and 



COOKING EGGS 6 1 

send at once to the table. These will 
fall if baked too much; they will not 
stand a moment, but, when well made 
and served quickly, are one of the 
daintiest of desserts. 

OMELET SOUFFLE 
This is, perhaps, one of the most 
difficult of all dishes to make. Like the 
preceding recipe, it must be made at 
the last moment and sent from the oven 
directly to the table. The eggs must 
be beaten to just the right point and 
the oven must be very hot. Get every- 
thing in readiness before beginning to 
make the souffle. When, however, you 
have accomplished this art, you have 
one of the most satisfactory desserts. 
Select a bowl, perfectly clean, and 
arrange the star tube and pastry bag, 



62 MANY WAYS FOR 

if you are going to use one. If not, 
get out a baking dish. Sift six table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar. Sepa- 
rate six eggs. Put three of the yolks 
aside (as you will only use three), 
and beat the other three until creamy. 
Beat the whites until they are very 
stiff but not dry or broken. Now add 
three tablespoonfuls of the sifted pow- 
dered sugar. Beat for fully ten min- 
utes. Then add the beaten yolks, the 
grated rind of a lemon and at the last 
a tablespoonful of lemon juice. Mix 
carefully and quickly, but thoroughly. 
Put four or five tablespoonfuls of this 
in the bottom of a platter, or baking 
dish. Put the remaining quantity 
quickly in the pastry bag, and press 
it out into roses. It is easier to make it 
in small rosettes all over the foundation. 



COOKING EGGS 63 

Dust quickly with the remaining three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Bake in a quick 
oven until golden brown. This will take 
about five minutes. Serve immediately. 
To be just right, this must be hot to 
the very centre, crisp on top, moist 
underneath. If baked too long, the 
moment the top is touched it will fall, 
becoming stringy and unpalatable. 

Omelet souffles are frequently 
flavored with rum, which must be 
mixed with the sugar. Sometimes they 
are sprayed with sherry just as they are 
taken from the oven. They may be 
built up into different forms, and gar- 
nished with candied or maraschino cher- 
ries, or chopped nuts. 



A List of Mrs. Rorer^s 
Cookery Books 

Published by 

Arnold and Company 

420 Sansom Street, Philadelphia 

Mrs. Rarer'* s 
NEJV Cook Book 

This book marks the highest point of develop- 
ment in Domestic Science, and represents the 
results of hard work of the best years of 
Mrs. Rorer's hfe. 

It is not a mere recipe book, but tells of 
those things one needs to know concerning 
cooking, living, health and best way of house- 
keeping. At the same time, each department 
has an abundance of new and good recipes, 
given in Mrs, Rorer's clear and lucid style, so 
that no one can possibly make mistakes. 

A magnificent department on vegetables 
will make the book welcome to the growing 
cult of vegetarians. The scientific division of 
the vegetables into groups, giving their con- 
stituents, will prove of great value to invalids 
afflicted with diabetes, kidney disease, etc. 



This New Cook Book of Mrs. 
Rorer's has no connection whatever 
with her other Cook Book. It is not 
a new edition of the old book. It is 
entirely dissimilar, and constructed 
along different lines. The two do 
not in any way conflict with each 
other. 

The new book is an advance in 
many particulars because Domestic 
Science has advanced with rapid 
strides during the past ten years. 
This book is Domestic Science at 
its best. 

It covers all departments of 
cookery thoroughly and well. For 
instance, the department of Vege- 
tables covers 163 pages, and is 
divided into groups, according to 
their constituent qualities. This 
will prove of inestimable value to 
the growing cult of vegetarians, 
invalids afflicted with diabetes, 
kidney disease, etc. 

The illustrations are practical 
and serve to make clear the methods 
employed. There is one set of 
pictures that shows the proper dress- 
ing of the table during a course 
dinner. This is a highly important 
matter, and one not always under- 
stood. Then there is a complete 
set showing the proper method of 
carving meats, poultry, game, etc.; 
and many others illustrating special 
features of the book.

pages, with portrait of the author; water- 
proof and grease-proof covers, ^1.75. 

This is the cook book that 
has been the friend and guide of 
thousands of housewives for years 
past. There is no better book 
extant. It is an original book, 
not a compilation from other 
sources. It Is as good to-day in 
its treatment of household cook- 
ery as the day it was first issued. 
The fact that 120,000 have been 
sold is a sure proof of its good- 
ness. It in no way conflicts with 
Mrs. Rorer' s New Cook Book. 
You can use both advantageously. 

The recipes are original and 
practical. You are never in 
doubt about the results of your 
cooking. Everything has been 
proved, and is bound to come 
out right if you follow directions.

In the course of her teach- 
ing and editorial work there have 
come to Mrs. Rorer frequent re- 
quests for a book that will provide 
a daily bill of fare, one that will 
be rational, its directions easy of 
accomplishment, and give an ex- 
cellent variety. Hence this Menu 
Book. It contains a menu for 
every meal in the year arranged 
by months and days ; menus for 
special occasions ; illustrations of 
decorated tables for various 
social events, with appropriate 
menus ; a department of menus 
without meats. It will be found 
a great help in the everyday 
affairs of the household.

Cakes 

Icings and Fillings 

By Mrs. Sarah Tyson Rorer, author of 
Mrs. Rorer' s New Cook Book, etc. Bound 
in cloth, 50 cents net; by mail, 55 cents. 

A good cake is a test of a 
woman's skill in baking. So 
many fail because they do not 
work by rule, but do everything 
by guess. If a recipe is properly 
put together, it must be followed 
to the letter to achieve success. 

Then ideas are necessarily 
limited, and people want and 
need variety. Here is where this 
book comes in to help. It is full 
of recipes for making all kinds 
of cakes, and if these recipes are 
strictly followed there cannot be 
any failure. To this are added 
directions for icing and filling 
those that need such attention. 



Canning and Preserving 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. 
Rorer's Cook Book, Hot Weather Dishes, 
etc. i2mo., with index, cloth covers, 
50 cents. 

In this volume Mrs. Rorer dis- 
cusses at greater length than is 
allowed in the limits of her work 
on cooking in general, the canning 
and preserving of fruits and vege- 
tables, with the kindred subjects 
of marmalades, butters, fruit j^Uies 
and syrups, drying and pickling. 
As in her Cook Book, the recipes 
are clearly and simply given, 
while an exhaustive index affords 
easy reference to every subject. 

"A useful little volume for the 
preserving season. Mrs. Rorer's 
exhaustive information on the sub- 
jects of preserves, pickles, jeUies, 
syrups, and canned goods gener- 
ally, is here placed at the service 
of the public in a cheap and 
convenient ioxva..'" -^Philadelphia 
Inquirer. 



Bread and Bread-Making 

By Mrs. S. T. Rorer, author of Mrs. 
Rorer's Cook Book, Salads, etc. Long 
i6mo, with Index ; cloth, 50 cents. 

Bread forms such an impor- 
tant part of the daily fare, that a 
book like this ought to be warmly 
welcomed by housewives every- 
where. It contains a chapter on 
wheat and how to properly select 
flour ; then follows directions for 
mixing, kneading, moulding and 
baking, with a chapter on yeast. 
The recipes cover the ground of 
bread-making completely. In the 
list we find white wheat bread, 
whole-wheat bread, French and 
Graham bread, 19th Century, Gol- 
den Loaf, Swedish, etc. Then 
there are the Small Breads, such 
as Vienna Rolls, Pocket Book 
Rolls, Crumpets, Muffins, German 
Horns, Nuns' Puffs, etc. A chap- 
ter on Second Cooking of Bread 
gives us Zwieback, Toasts, Pulled 
Bread, etc., followed by Quick 
Breads, Steamed Breads and 
Sweet Breads,
