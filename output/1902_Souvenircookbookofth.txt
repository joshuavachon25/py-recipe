The Reasons Why — ^ 

TETLEY'S TEAS 

Have become a Household Necessity. 

They are the choicest growths of the finest tea producing countries in the world. 

CEYLON-INDIA teas are the best kind, and TETLEY'S TEAS are the best 
of the kind. 

They are blended and packed in the bonded warehouse of Joseph Tetley & Co., 
London, under the most watchful care of trained experts, whose business it is to see that 
purity and uniformity can lie fully guaranteed. 

They are sold only in air-tight lead packets, so that the original freshness and 
fragrance of the leaf is unimpaired. 

They are most economical because their greater strength requires a smaller quantity 
for a satisfactory infusion. 



Prepare your tea carefully in accord- 
ance with instructions on each packet.
