FRUITAGE SHOWN 



IN PLANTINGS OF 

THE MISSION FATHERS 

The dried fig of commerce is one of the 
first and most favored of the fruits spoken 
of in the history of civilization, the fruit 
first produced around Jerusalem and 
Damascus. 

There are but a few favored sections 
along the Mediterranean Ocean where the 
fig of commerce can thrive. No other 
section in all the world has been dis- 
covered, for thousands of years, where 
this fig of commerce can be grown 
properly except in the San Joaquin and 
the Sacramento Valleys of Central Cali- 
fornia. 

The findings of forty years, years of 
patient endeavor and of exhaustive ex- 
periments, have determined that this west- 
coast section, in soil and in climate, 
peculiarly favors the fig that has made 
famous the far-away Valley of Maeander, 
Asia Minor. 

Moreover, the history of the fig in Cali- 
fornia is fraught with interest, and has to 
do with the sacrificial wanderings of the 
Franciscan Fathers, who traversed dur- 
ing the pre-territorial period the then

wastes now included within the boun- 
daries of the Golden State. 

Wherever there was left the impress of 
the Mission Father, there has ever been 
in propagation the little Black Fig of 
pleasant fruitage. 

Aside from other now world-famous 
fig-tree growths of the San Joaquin (Cali- 
fornia) Valley, the six thousand acres of 
Fig Gardens, comprising the J. C. Forkner 
Fig Gardens, just north of the city of 
Fresno, give emphasis to the claims made 
for the Central California section. 

This six-thousand-acre tract of fig gar- 
dens has been and is being divided into 
the smaller, individual holdings, bringing 
into being a community of prosperous 
homes the beginning of the larger de- 
velopment now in the planning.

FOOD VALUE 

OF THE COMMON FIG 

The Ficus Carica, or common fig, is but 
one of more than an hundred species of a 
most interesting fruit which, from the 
earliest of ancient times has, in its varying 
forms, been accorded not only a place of 
importance but of honor and of reverence. 

Biblical records mention the fig as cloth- 
ing, as food, as medicine, and, in the 
matter of clothing, were it still "the 
fashion to wear 'em" the Fig Leaf would 
be particularly enhanced in value a fact 
due to the infinite variety of its pattern, 
two leaves, even on the same tree, never 
being found exactly alike featuring "ex- 
clusive designs. " 

In the matter of food values, according 
to scientific analysis, the fig has no equal. 
In its component parts, there is nothing 
of refuse ; the fig carries the minimum of 
water; in protein the fig is rated at 4.3; 
in fat, .3 ; in carbo-hydrates, 74.2 ; in ash, 
2.4, approximating in fuel, flesh-sustain- 
ing value per pound in calories 1475. 

The only other fruits approaching the 
fig in these vital essentials are the date 
and the prune all others carrying but 
370, and less, of calories.

HEALTHFULNESS 

A FIG CHARACTERISTIC 

Either green or dried, the fig has no 
superior in healthfulness among the fruits 
of common usage, and in food values holds 
a place entirely its own. 

The large amount of sugar carried by 
the fig is most nourishing, and, being one 
of nature's best laxatives, pleasant to the 
taste, mild yet positive in effect, easily 
displaces the decidedly acid fruits. 

In addition to the wholesome qualities 
of the fig, there is no fruit which, dried 
or preserved by some method of cooking, 
so retains or so transforms its charms 
into equal attractiveness. 

The fig is quite unique in being as 
agreeable dried as in its original, fresh 
juciness and its saccharine quality is 
greater.

FACTS ABOUT FIGS 

AND HOW TO USE THEM 

TO EAT FRESH FIGS 

When figs are served at the table un- 
cooked, hold them by the stem and, with 
a small knife, cut the fruit across twice, 
at right angles, downward as far as the 
stem. Thus quartered, the pulp will open 
and hang slightly outward but will not 
become entirely detached. Then with the 
knife separate the pulp from the skin, 
gently scraping it toward you, from the 
center, or stem-heart, downward. By this 
method one secures the entire pulp with- 
out the skin, and in convenient bits for 
eating. 

TO FRESHEN FIGS 

Place dried figs in an enamelled colan- 
der and steam until soft and filled out in 
appearance. Remove and prepare further 
for cooking as desired, or roll in con- 
fectioners ' sugar and set aside to partially 
dry before serving. A drop of tart fruit 
juice and a little sugar may be placed 
inside the fig. 

TO SERVE FIGS 

If the figs are of the dried order, they 
should be washed, drained and chilled. 



THE J. C. FORKNER FTO &A V RDENS RECIPES 



DAINTY DELIGHTS 



TOASTY TEASERS 

Wash carefully and in boiling water cook until 
tender a half-pound of pulled figs, add one-fourth 
cup of sugar and the grated rind and juice of half 
a lemon. Cook until the syrup is well reduced. 
Cut the crust from a thick slice of bread and saute 
to a golden brown, first on one side and then on 
the other, in two tablespoonfuls of hot butter. 
Drain the bread on soft paper; then heap the figs 
upon it, cover with two-thirds of a cup of thick 
cream, and a scant fourth cup of sugar, beaten 
until stiff. Serve at once. Sponge cake may be 
used in the place of bread. 

FIG FLUFF-DUFF 

Stew one cup of dried figs until tender, then put 
through a colander and mix with one cup of sugar 
in which has been sifted a teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar. Beat thoroughly the whites of five eggs 
with a pinch of salt and when perfectly stiff add 
the yolks of two eggs and whip again. Now mix 
lightly, a little at a time, with the figs and sugar 
and place in a buttererd baking dish. Sprinkle over 
the top one-half cup of fine-chopped nuts and bake 
for fifteen minutes. Serve this with cream, plain 
or whipped. 

FIG FOAM 

Make an orange or lemon gelatine jelly. (With 
a plain gelatine it is best to follow directions given 
by the manufacturers of the particular brand one 
uses, as they know best the strength of their 
gelatine, using, however, in a warm climate one 
cup less of water than that recommended.) With 
this as a foundation, when the gelatine begins to 
harden slightly on being removed from the stove 
and whipped in process of cooling, add the well- 
beaten whites of two eggs and one cup of chopped 
figs. Place in a mould and set on ice to chill.

Ml D W 1 INI T Efl IVi AC BDO hvJE 

Five or six cooked figrs, one banana, one grape- 
fruit or two oranges. 

Cut the figs in smooth slices, scrape the banana 
and cut in thin slices; remove the, grapefruit or 
orang-e pulp in neat pieces from the respective 
fruits, cut in halves. Save all of the juice. Dis- 
pose the fruit in glass or china saucers, reserving 
a slice of banana and five or six slices of the fig 
for each saucer; divide the fruit juice among the 
dishes; set the slices of banana in the center and 
arrange the slices of figs from the banana to the 
edge, like the spokes of a wheel. Sprinkle with 
powdered sugar before finishing the dishes, or pass 
the sugar at time of serving. 

ANGELS' DELIGHT 

Use one pound dried figs. Soak in cold water 
until soft, then stew slowly until tender. Add sugar 
enough to make a rich,.; heavy syrup, and flavor 
with a few drops of vanilla. Cool and turn into 
a glass dish. Just before serving, cover the figs 
with whipped cream which has been sweetened and 
flavored with vanilla. Serve small plain cakes or 
wafers with it. 

DORA CHRISTY WHIP 

Five cooked figs, four whites of eggs, one-half 
cup of sugar, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt. Boiled 
custard made of one pint of milk, yolks of four 
eggs, one-third cup of sugar, one- fourth teaspoonful 
of salt. 

Cut the figs in tiny bits; beat the whites dry; 
gradually beat in the sugar and salt, then fold in 
the figs. Turn into a buttered-and-sugared dish. 
Bake on many folds of paper and surrounded with 
boiling water. The water should not boil during 
the cooking. The whip or souffle, is done when 
firm in the center. Serve hot with boiled custard, 
or with cream and sugar. 

FIGS, BANANAS AND NUTS 

Four figs, four bananas, two tablespoons pow- 
dered sugar, one-fourth cup chopped nut meats. 

Peel, scrape and slice bananas; wash, dry and 
chop the figs ; spread figs over the bananas ; sprinkle 
with sugar and nut-meats, and serve with cream. 

Grape-nuts may be used instead of nut-meats. 

WARD WHIP 

Peel fresh figs, sprinkle with enough sugar to 
sweeten them, chop very fine; let stand until the 
sugar is dissolved; then to one cup of the mixture 
whip in the whites of two eggs thoroughly whipped 
and scalded. Set away to cool. Serve with cake.

A BEHEN TEMPTATION 

Take large white figs, as many as are desired, 
for five minutes steam them ovor hot water; re- 
move from the steamer and while yet warm press 
each fig down flat and round, and place the half 
of a walnut in the center of each. 

DAINTY BETTY ROLLS 

Chop soft figs fine, putting flour on the chopping 
knife to keep the figs from sticking to the knife; 
add an enual quantity of pecan meats; mix with 
cream until it will spread readily. Use brown - 
bread, free from crusts, and cut very thin. Roll 
each sandwich and hold with a wooden toothpick. 

MARA ELLA TOAST 

Six eggs beaten separately; three-fourths of a 
cup of butter; one cup of sugar; one-half pound 
of chopped walnuts; one pound of chopped figs; six 
tablespoons of fine bread crumbs. 

Cream the butter and the sug-^r, add the egg- 
yolks well beaten; add the figs and the nuts which 
have been chopped or cut into small pieces. M'x 
in the baking powder and crumbs and add to the 
mixture; lastly, add the well-beaten egg-whites. 

Bake in rather a thin sheet in a moderate oven. 
Serve with whipped cream as a frosting. 

ELLETA S. MACAROONS 

One cup of sugar; two-thirds of a cup of butter; 
two eggs; stir until light and creamy; two cups of 
sifted flour; two-thirds of a teaspoon of soda; one 
teaspoon of salt; one teaspoon of cinnamon. 

Sift the flour, soda, salt and cinnamon together; 
add to the sugar, butter and egg mixture; then 
add two cups of rolled oatmeal, put through a, 
grinder; one cup of shredded raisins; one cup of 
chopped nuts; one cup of shredded figs. Mix thor- 
oughly. Drop by teaspoonfuls on a greased pan; 
bake rather slowly. 

FIG FOLLIES 

Use any good sponge cake. To make the "fol- 
lies," or balls, cut the sponge cake into one-inch 
squares, or a little larger, niping off the corners 
with a knife; dip into "Boiled Frosting," then roll 
in a mixture of chopped figs and nuts.

FIG SPECIALS 



APPLES STUFFED WITH FIGS 

Select plump, juicy dried figs, wash them, care- 
fully pinching them into their natural shape; select 
good, firm apples, wash them, scoop out the cores, 
and into these holes press two or three whole figs; 
place them in a baking- pan and bake in a hot 
oven; while baking baste them with a syrup made 
from the juice of half a lemon, two tablespoons 
of sugar and a half-cup of water. 

The secret of making good baked apples is to 
have them thoroughly baked, but not baked in 
pieces. If when they look done they are soft to 
the core, cover the baking dish and let them steam 
for a few minutes; remove the cover and brown 
the fruit slightly. These apples may be served 
either alone or with Hamburg cream. 

FIG AND NUT SOUFFLE 

Press one cup stewed figs through a colander, 
add one-half cup sugar mixed with one teaspoon 
cornstarch, or cool and add two beaten egg yolks 
and a little lemon juice. Fold in the stiffly beaten 
whites of five eggs, turn into a buttered dish, 
sprinkle with minced nuts and bake twenty min- 
utes in a pan of water. Serve with boiled custard 
made of the remaining egg yolks. 

FIG CONSERVE- 
TWO pounds of fresh figs, or one quart of plain 
canned figs; one orange, one and one-half pounds 
of sugar, one-half cup of pecans (shelled), one-half 
pound of raisins. Cut all, except nuts, into small 
pieces and cook until thick and transparent (about 
one hour). Add nuts five minutes before removing 
from stove. Pack and seal hot. Process pint jars 
for thirty minutes at 180 degrees Fahrenheit in 
a water bath.

A "LELL" CHARTREUSE 

Wash one-half pound of figs in warm water and 
drain. Barely cover with cold water and soak over 
night. Place in a double boiler and cook very 
slowly until tender, then pour off the juice. Wash 
one cupful of rice and drop into a kettle of slightly 
salted water and boil for ten minutes. Drain and 
place in a double boiler, and from time to time add 
a little milk until very soft and the milk is all 
absorbed, then stir in one tablespoonful of sugar. 
Have ready a buttered mold. Line bottom and 
sides with the rice, place the figs in the center and 
cover with the rest of the rice. Measure the fig 
juice, add water if necessary, to make one pint, 
add one-half cupful of sugar and boil for ten 
minutes. Bake the chartreuse for fifteen minutes 
in a slow oven, then turn out. Serve with the fig 
syrup, to which is added a little vanilla. 

FIG-APPLE SHORTCAKE 

One-half pound figs, four tart apples, one-half 
cup of water, one-third cup of sugar, one-fourth 
teaspoon of nutmeg. Wash and chop the figs; 
pare, core and slice the apples; simmer with the 
figs, water, sugar and nutmeg until thick enough to 
spread. Spread between and on top of shortcake. 

COMPOTE OF F!GS 

One pound of pulled figs, two cups of water, one- 
fourth cup of sugar, four teaspoons of lemon-juice, 
one cup . of cream, one-fourth cup of powdered 
sugar. 

Soak figs in water, then press into shape. Mix 
sugar and water, boil until syrupy, add lemon- 
juice. Arrange figs on serving dish; cover with 
syrup; garnish with sweetened cream, beaten until 
stiff, pressed through pastry bag and tube. 

RAYBOURNE COMPOTE 

One pound of figs, one pound of sugar, one thick 
slice of a lemon; simmer the figs, covered with 
water, for an hour; when cool, remove the figs, 
press into natural shape and pile on a glass dish. 
Take the water in which the figs were cooked, 
add the sugar to sweeten, and the slice of lemon; 
boil until a thick syrup. Pour the syrup over the 
figs. Serve cold with whipped cream. 

FIG CROQUETS 

When making rice croquets, have ready some figs 
which have been plumped in hot water. Dust each 
fig with sugar and a little cinnamon, and place in 
the center of the croquet. Cook as usual.

FIG SQUARES 

Cook ripe, peeled figrs slowly in double boiler 
with a little sugar and flavoring: (if desired;, till 
smooth and thick. Almonds may be added while 
cooking:. Pour into shallow moulds or pans and 
dry slowly in sun, oven or dryer; when perfectly 
dry, cut in squares or strips and wrapping: in oiled 
paper store in dry place. These may be used for 
cookery as are the commercial figs. 

FIGS AND MACARONI, OR 

FIGS AND DRIED-APPLE SAUCE 

Cook two cups of dried figs with enough water 
to well-cover; when nearly done put about a cup 
of sugar over them. Be sure that there is about 
a cup of juice when the figs are done. In another 
pan, cook about two cups of macaroni in boiling- 
salt water until done; put figrs and macaroni in 
separate dishes, but when served combine them. 
Dried apples, instead of the macaroni, is used with 
pleasing- results. 

MAY-IRENE CREAMS 

Wash the figs, and put them in a saucepan with 
just enough water to cover them and with a half- 
cup of granulated sugar. Simmer until the figs 
are tender when pierced with a fork. Take from 
the fire and spread on a plate to cool. Add a cup 
of sugar to the liquid and boil to a rather thick 
syrup. Take from the fire and pour over the figs. 
When very cold put into a glass dish and just 
before sending to the table, heap whipped cream 
on top. Eat with light cake. 

PARISIENE COMPOTE 

Five oranges cut fine; four bananas cut thin; 
one cup of Malaga grapes, cut; one cup of fresh 
figs, cut; one cup of walnut meats; the juice of 
one lemon. Sprinkle with sugar and one-half tea- 
spoon of cinnamon; cover with whipper cream. 

FIG LAXATIVE 

One pound of dried figs, or one-half pound of 
dried figs and one-half pound of raisins, to one 
ounce of Senna leaves. Chop fine and put into a 
stew-pan with one cup of sugar and one cup of 
boiling water. Let it simmer slowly for twenty 
minutes, then pour out on oiled paper in long 
baking tin to cool. A piece about an inch square 
at bedtime may prove sufficient, if not take more 
as conditions may determine.

THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



BAKED FIGS 

Place fresh figs in a small crock or earthen 
dish, with a little sugar and lemon juice or that 
of other fruit. Cover and bake slowly and no 
water will be required. 

A BURT COMPOTE 

Take one dozen large figs, cut in halves or quar- 
ters, put them into a saucepan with a package of 
gelatine, two ounces of fine sugar and enough 
water to cover them; let them simmer slowly for 
two hours, then pour into a wet mould. When 
quite set, turn out; serve with a surrounding of 
whipped cream.

FIG CONFECTIONS 



CANDIED OR CRYSTALLIZED FIGS 

Place fully- ripe, perfect figs in a wire basket and 
dip them into a deep kettle of hot lye made from 
wood ashes. Let them remain in the lye a minute 
or two to remove the gum and milk and until the 
fig's begin to shrivel slightly. Let all the lye drip 
off the figs, place them in a kettle or vat of boil- 
ing syrup, and let them remain in it three or four 
minutes. On removing them from the boiling syrup 
drain and sprinkle thickly with granulated sugar, 
then place on thin wooden slabs or "hurdles" of 
galvanized iron and dry very slowly in fruit dryer, 
or slow oven, turning the figs frequently. When 
thoroughly dried and sugared, these may be packed 
in layers, with oiled paper between, and kept in a 
dry place. 

CANDIED FIGS 

Are made only from young green figs not yet 
fully ripe. Place in glass jars, pour on salt water, 
and steam until soft. Pour off the salt water and 
pour over a syrup made of one cup of sugar to 
three of water. After a day, take out, place on 
wire screens, and allow to drip for one or two 
days in a warm place. Place again in jars or 
earthenware; cover with a syrup made of one cup 
of sugar to one and one-half cups of water. After 
a day, take out and allow to drip. The third soak- 
ing should be in a syrup made of one cup of sugar 
to one-half cup of water. In this syrup the figs 
are allowed to remain as long as possible, or until 
required. Take out, drip and roll in confectioners' 
powdered white sugar in a pan made lukewarm. 
When the figs have absorbed all the sugar they 
can they are taken out and packed in large boxes 
with powdered sugar. The preserved fruit is after- 
wards re-packed in small boxes for the market.

JEANIE F. S. CRYSTALS 

The figs must be picked when fully ripe, but 
before they are shriveled. Take figs of as even 
a size as possible in order to save assorting- after- 
wards. Simmer in a kettle for twenty or thirty 
minutes, but do not allow to boil. When ready, 
the figs will have become clear and semi-trans- 
parent. Drain off the water. Prepare a strong 
syrup of best white sugar and drop the figrs in. 
Keep this in a cool place. In from twenty-four 
to thirty- six hours, the figrs will have absorbed most 
of the sugar and the syrup become very weak. 
Draw off the syrup, add more white sugar, and 
thus make the syrup stronger. Simmer but do not 
boil. Drop the figs in and test again in twenty- 
four hours. If the syrup is weak renew the process. 
When the syrup retains its strength, the process 
is discontinued. Prepare a very strong sjvup of 
best white sugar; simmer, but do not boil. Previous 
to this the figs are dried in the sun or in dryer 
until they slightly ring when dropped on a stone 
floor. The figs, however, should not be so dry 
that they cannot be readily squeezed when pressed 
between the fingers. Now immerse these dried 
figs for a few seconds in the strong, hot syrup, 
then drain off and place on wire trays in a hot- 
air dryer or in the hot sun, if on a warm day. 
The syrup dries quickly and leaves the figs glaced. 
If crystallized figs are wanted, the figs are slowly 
dried in the shade, in which case the syrup crystal- 
lizes instead of producing a glace. 

BEILING SWEETS 

One cup of figs, one cup of dates, one cup of 
nut-meats. Put these through a meat-grinder, and 
make into small balls. These may be dipped in 
chocolate if desired. Any kind of nuts may be 
used. If these ingredients fail to stick together 
in the making of the balls, several drops of 
molasses may be added. 

A JENNEY FUDGE 

One pound of brown sugar, a pinch of cream 
of tartar, one-fourth pound of chopped figs, a pinch 
of salt, one tablespoonful of butter, one cupful of 
water, one teaspoonful of lemon extract. 

Dissolve the sugar and water in a saucepan; add 
the butter and the cream of tartar; when this 
boils, add the figs, and boil to a soft ball when 
tried in cold water, stirring all the time. Remove 
from the fire, add lemon extract and salt, cool for 
five minutes, then stir until it begins to grain, 
and quickly pour into buttered tins. When half- 
cooled, mark into squares.

beat until it is thick enough to put on buttered 
plates. When cool, cut in slices. Splendid for 
children. 

VOGEL STRIPS 

One pound of any kind of figs, one pound of 
raisins, one pound of walnuts of any variety; grind 
them all together in a vegetable grinder; roll the 
mixture into a nice round roll; lay them to one 
side to dry will dry in about five days. When 
dry, slice thin or thick, according to fancy, drop 
the slices into dry sugar. A real dainty.

Page Eleven 



THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



ROGER S. BONBONS 

One cup of figs, one cup of raisins, one cup of 
walnut meats, one-half cup of shredded cocoanut; 
grind all tog-ether in a meat-choper, then roll into 
balls; mix in a little powdered sugar if necessary 
to keep the balls smooth in shape. 

Melt unsweetened chocolate in a double boiler; 
keep the chocolate just warm enough to prevent 
solidifying-. With a silver fork or hatpin drop the 
balls into the chocolate. See that each piece is 
completely coated, then remove to wax paper to 
harden. 

FRUIT ROLL 

Boil two cups of white sugar with one-half cup 
of water, until it forms a soft ball in cold water. 
Remove from the fire; let it cool and beat it until 
it creams. Be careful not to have it too stiff. 
Add one cvip each of finely- chopped figs and dates, 
and beat as long as possible. Roll in a wet cloth, 
and leave in a cool place over night. 

Slice in thin strips, or cut in fancy shapes. 

FIG FUDGE- 
TO two cups of granulated sugar add two-thirds 
of a cup of sweet milk and one-third cup of butter. 
Add one teaspoon of vanilla when the syrup has 
begun to simmer. Stir this until just after the 
vanilla has been added, then let it cook for twenty- 
five minutes without stirring, watching carefully, 
however, that it does not burn. When a light 
brown in color pour out on plates on which are 
spread chopped figs and let cool. 

HOLIDAY HASH- 
TWO cups of granulated sugar; one-half cup of 
maple or brown sugar; one-half cup of golden 
corn syrup; one cup of water and a pinch of cream 
of tartar. Boil to the hard "soft ball" stage; add 
one teaspoon of vanilla, and pour over the stiffly- 
beaten whites of two eggs. Have ready one-fourth 
cup of chopped figs, candied cherries, citron and 
orange rind, and one-half cup of chopped or 
shredded cocoanut. 

Beat the syrup until light and foamy, then stir 
in the fruit. Pour into a buttered tin, and mark 
off the squares. 

FIG CARAMELS 

Take any dry fig and run through a grinder. 
Press into a cake and cut in squares about the 
size of a caramel. Dip in confectioners' melted 
chocolate, sweetened to taste.

DAINTY BARNETT BITS 

Two pounds of black or white figs (black pre- 
ferred) dried; one pound of seeded raisins, two 
cups of black walnut meats. Put all through a 
meat-grinder twice. Knead into brick form; cut 
into slices about one inch thick; dip in powdered 
sugar; wrap in oiled paper. The longer these "bits" 
are kept the more delicious they become. 

FIG FAVORS 

Two cups of light brown sugar; one cup of gran- 
ulated sugar; one cup of milk; one cup of chopped 
figs; one tablespoon of butter; one teaspoon of 
vanilla. Boil the sugar and the milk a few min- 
utes, add the butter; boil until a soft ball will form 
in water. 

Add the vanilla and the figs, beat until creamy, 
and pour into a buttered pan. Cut in squares. 

LOVERTIE FANCIES 

Three cupfuls white granulated sugar, one cupful 
Karo corn syrup (Red Label;, one-half cupful of 
water, whites of two eggs, one-fourth teaspoonful 
baking-powder, one cupful chopped figs, one-half 
teaspoonful vanilla extract. 

Put sugar, syrup and water in saucepan, and 
boil until syrup forms soft ball when tested in cold 
water. Add the baking-powder to the egg whites 
and beat to a stiff froth; take syrup from fire, add 
egg-froth, a spoonful at a time, until all has been 
added, beating constantly. When the mixture 
begins to thicken, add the chopped figs and the 
extract, and beat until creamy. Pour into a but- 
tered pan and allow to cool. Cut into tubes, or 
cut with fancy cutter. Any favorite flavoring may 
be used. This candy Is best when allowed to stand 
for two or three days. 

PERSIAN SWEETS 

One pound of figs; one pound of dates; one pound 
of English walnut meats; confectioners' sugar. 

Remove the stems from the figs and the stones 
from the dates; mix the fruit with the nut-meats 
and force through a meat-chopper. Work with the 
hands on a board dredged with confectioners' sugar, 
until well-blended. Roll to one-quarter of an inch 
in thickness, shape with a small round cutter, or 
cut with a sharp knife into three-quarters of an 
inch squares. Roll each piece in confectioners' 
sugar. Pack in layers in a tin box, putting waxed 
paper between each layer. These confections may 
be used at dinner in place of bonbons or ginger 
chips.

CHOCOLATE DOMINOES 

One-half cup of pecan meats; one-half cup of 
English walnut meats; one-half cup of fig's; one- 
half cup of dates; the grated' rind of one orange; 
one tablespoon of orange- juice; one square of 
chocolate. 

Mix the nuts and fruit and put through a food- 
chopper; wet with the orange- juice, mix in the 
grated rind, and roll in a ball. Lay out on a 
baking-board which has been covered with con- 
fectioners' sugar, sifted; roll to one-half inch in 
thickness. Cut in shapes the size of a domino, 
and spread with melted chocolate. On the top lay 
little discs cut from blanched almonds to imitate 
dominoes. 

GLACE FIGS 

Put figs (fresh) in pan. Make syrup to cover in 
proportion of one cup and a half of sugar to one 
cup of water. Cook until figs are a little yellow 
and keep in syrup over night. Next day, cook in 
same syrup half an hour and again leave over 
night, then cook until stem is transparent, and 
leave until cold. Then drain on plate, spread on 
mosquito netting stretched over pan or tray, and 
dry thoroughly. Wet the netting before placing 
the fruit upon it. The Kadota fig is recommended 
for this purpose. 

FIG CANDY 

Boil over a slow fire one pound of sugar and 
a half-pint of water, until the syrup hardens when 
dropped into cold water. Add half a teaspoon of 
vinegar and remove from the fire, stirring once 
or twice before pouring over a layer of figs placed 
in a deep dish. Dried figs may be used either 
previously soaked an hour in cold water, or those 
perfectly dry. The dried fig is more apt to give 
good results than the fresh fig. 

ALVERSON ANGELICS 

Two cups of sugar; one-half cup of water; one- 
half cup of corn syrup; boil until the mixture spins 
a thread. Three cups of ground dried figs; two 
cups of ground raisins; one cup of ground English 
walnuts; one teaspoon of extract of nutmeg. Have 
a pan greased and thickly dusted with cocoanut; 
have the figs, raisins, nuts and extract mixed. As 
soon as the syrup threads, take from the stove and 
beat until the mixture is cloudy. Fold in the fruit 
mixture, turn out in the prepared pan, and dust 
the top with cocoanut.

CANDIED CALIMYRNAS 

Take the ripe Calimyrna figs before they begin 
to dry on the tree, those just right for canning; 
dry them in the sun for four or five days; don't 
let them sour. When well- dried, pack them down 
in sugar, layer upon layer, the sugar between each 
layer. In five days they will be ready for eating. 
The result of this simple treatment will be found 
most pleasing.

STUFFED FIGS 



A MARIE CONCEIT 

Select natural or pressed fig's, remove the stems, 
and wash in hot water. Put into a steamer or 
colander over a dish of hot water, cover closely 
and steam until thoroughly softened, then remove 
from the heat. When cool, stuff each fig- with a 
walnut-meat by making an opening in the side of 
the fig and enclosing the nut. Sprinkle the figs 
with granulated sugar. 

STUFFED FIGS 

One pound of pulled figs, one-half pound of 
mixed nuts. The nut mixture may consist of 
almonds, pecans, English walnuts and pinon. Chop 
them very fine. Beat the white of one egg until 
partly light; then add six tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, and beat until stiff. Stir the nuts 
into this paste, add a half of the grated yellow 
rind of an orange or a little vanilla; mix thor- 
oughly. Split the figs carefully on one side; scoop 
out a portion of the inside flesh; mix it with the 
nuts; then stuff the figs until they are quite dis- 
tended, putting the skin together so that the split 
may not be seen. Arrange on a paper mat in a 
pretty glass dish, and serve as dessert. 

SUGARED ROLLS 

Remove the inside of steamed or fresh figs and 
mix the part removed with chopped nuts moistened 
with a syrup of sugar and tart fruit-juice (cooked 
or uncooked). Roll in sugar and serve.

FIG PASTES 



A PICNIC DELIGHT 

Treat the figs with a soda bath as for pre- 
serves, rinse and cook until tender, in fresh clear 
boiling water. Drain well and put the figs through 
a food- chopper or rub pulp through a colander. 
Allow one pound of sugar for each quart of pulp. 
Mix and cook until it is rather a solid mass. Spread 
with an oiled spatula on the oiled surface of a 
flat dish, marble or glass slab, and finish drying 
in the sun. Three or four days will be required 
for drying. The trays should be brought into the 
house each night, and they should be protected 
from both flying and crawling insects. When thor- 
oughly dry, sprinkle with granulated sugar, roll it 
up and wrap tightly in a cloth. It will keep for a 
long period of time. 

FIG BUTTER 

Chop together equal parts of figs, seeded raisins 
and stoned dates, and add (after weighing) nuts 
equal in weight to the whole. The nuts may be 
mixed according to convenience or taste, as one 
part each of black and white walnuts, pecans, 
almonds, peanuts, hazel or Brazil nuts. Mix thor- 
oughly together and pack in a mould for slicing. 

FIG-PASTE LAXATIVE 

One-half pound of figs, one pound of prunes, one 
ounce of Senna leaves, cold water. 

Soak the prunes over-night in cold water to 
cover, add the Senna leaves tied in cheesecloth, 
and cook slowly until prunes are tender. Stone 
the prunes and chop fine; add the figs, chopped 
fine; put in top of double boiler, remove Senna, 
add prune-juice, and cook until thick.

TOWNEY PASTE 

1. Pick the figrs fully ripe, split and scrape off 
the pulp, mash and strain and let come to a boil, 
constantly stirring. To ten pounds of fig-pulp add 
one pound grated cocoanut and the juice of one 
lemon. After boiling a half -hour spread on plates 
and dry in the sun. When fully dried keep in an 
air-tight plrce if possible. When ready to use, 
soak in warm water over night and boil in the 
same water. 

2. Figs must be very ripe. Wash in water, 
steam in colander for a few minutes, then nib 
through a sieve, using best rubber gloves on the 
hands. The rubber gloves must have been pre- 
viously washed several times in hot water in order 
to remove the taste of the rubber. The mushy 
pulp is then placed in jars and steamed for forty- 
five minutes or more. If not sweet, add sugar to 
taste. Spread the mush on glass or marble to dry 
in the sun of* in heated air. Fig sauce is made 
in the same manner, except that it is preserved 
in jars while yet mushy instead of drying in the 
sun. 

3. Pick the figs when well ripened, but not so 
soft as to be difficult to handle. Peel them, weigh, 
and allow three-fourths of a pound of best gran- 
ulated sugar to one pound of fruit. Mix sugar and 
fruit thoroughly with your hands, or by mashing 
together with a large potato masher, and let the 
mixture stand over night. Prepare the afternoon 
before, if the weather is very hot, but if it is not 
they can stand from one forenoon to the next. In 
the morning put them on the back of the stove and 
let the paste heat slowly, stirring occasionally. 
Then, when ready to give it your whole attention, 
pull forward and "cook down" over a rather slow 
fire, stirring and mashing almost constantly. There 
must not be a single lump left in the mass. If 
desired, some of the seeds which rise and accumu- 
late on the sides of the preserving kettle may be 
skimmed out. The amount of cooking down done 
is according to taste. The paste is better when 
well cooked down, but if this is done, great care 
must be taken not to burn the paste at the last, 
when it is quite thick. It is so rich that for small 
families it should be put into pint or half-pint jars.

FIG MARMALADES 



A FREDA FAVORITE 

One pound of figs, three pounds of rhubarb, three 
pounds of sugar, one lemon, one teaspoon of ginger, 
one-fourth teaspoon of cloves, one-fourth teaspoon 
of salt. 

Cut the rhubarb unpeeled into inch pieces; wash 
the fig-s and put them through a food- chopper; put 
in preserving kettle with half of sugar and let 
stand over night; in the morning boil until clear, 
then add remaining sugar, the juice and grated 
rind of lemon, and seasoning. Cook slowly until 
thickened. 

WHITE-FIG MARMALADE 

A delicious marmalade is made from white figs. 
Take perfectly ripe and fresh figs, peel off the thin 
soft skin, and to every two pounds of figs use one 
and one-half pounds of sugar and the grated peel 
of a large orange or lemon; cut up the figs and 
mash them with sugar, adding the grated yellow 
rind and juice of the orange or lemon; boil all 
together until the whole is reduced to a thick, 
clear, smooth mass, stirring frequently from the 
bottom. When done put into jars while hot and 
cover closely. 

Those who like less sugar can use one-half 
pound of sugar to a pound of fruit, and it will 
keep perfectly, provided it be boiled very clear 
and smooth. 

J. W. T. MARMALADE 

Ten pounds of ripe, peeled figs, ten pounds of 
sugar; let stand over night. In the morning stir 
the figs and the sugar until all are dissolved; cook 
for two or three hours slowly. May add orange, 
lemon and walnuts, or pineapple well cooked and 
chopped fine.

TRIXIE MARMALADE 

Use only fully-ripe figs. When they are con- 
siderably wilted they are cut. Cut in halves and 
scrape out the inside pulp; mash and strain 
through a very coarse sieve. Put into a glazed 
dish and place the latter in boiling water. Boil 
constantly for one-half hour and place in sealed 
glass jars, like canned fruit. This marmalade is 
very fine; can be eaten with meat or alone with 
cream. It is a fine relish if made from good, sweet 
figs.

FIG PRESERVES 



FIG AND GRAPE PRESERVES 

White figs and Muscat grapes are sometimes 
preserved together, the second crop of figs coming 
in season to can with the grapes. Pick the figs 
when their skins begin to crack, peel, weigh, and 
allow one- half pound of best granulated sugar to 
one pound of fruit. Mix the fruit and sugar care- 
fully (not breaking the figs;, and let them stand 
over night. In the morning, cook slowly on the 
back of your stove, stirring carefully at intervals. 
In the morning, also prepare your Muscat grapes 
by picking them from their stems, washing, weigh- 
ing, and allowing one-fourth pound of sugar to one 
pound of fruit (and as many grapes by weight as 
figs). Cook in another kettle, using only a very 
little water just enough to keep them from burn- 
ing. They will cook after starting to boil, in about 
ten minutes. The figs will need cooking nearly an 
hour. When both fruits are done, mix carefully 
together, let come to a boil and can. 

GOLDEN WEST PRESERVES 

Take three-fourths pound sugar and half cup of 
water to each pound of figs. Make a syrup of the 
sugar and water, skim, add the figs, carefully) 
washed and dried, and let simmer until the skin 
of the figs is tender, then store as any preserves. 
For a less sweet dish, use a cup of sugar and a 
cup of water to enough figs to fill a quart jar; 
make the syrup and let cook as before, but store 
as canned fruit in sterile jars, filled to overflow 
and sealed with rubbers and sterile covers. Lemon 
or orange rind and juice, or sherry wine, all in 
quantity according to taste, may be added. 

TEEL PRESERVES 

Ten pounds of well-washed ripe figs, ten pounds 
of sugar, and water to make a syrup; boil half an 
hour, place figs in syrup, and boil slowly about 
two hours. 

Page Twenty- eierht 



THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



SIMPLICITY PRESERVES 

Gather the fruit when fully ripe, but not cracked 
open; place in a perforated tin bucket or wire 
basket and dip for one moment into a deep kettle 
of hot and moderately strong- lye (some prefer 
letting them lie an hour in limewater, and after- 
wards drain;; make a syrup in proportion of one 
pound of sugar to one pound of fruit, and when 
the fig's are well-drained put them in the syrup and 
boil them until well-cooked; removing-, boil the 
syrup down until there is just enough to cover the 
fruit; put the fruit back in the syrup, let all boil, 
and seal while hot in glass or porcelain jars. 



BERGEN PRESERVES 

Take figs as soon as they are sufficiently ripe 
to peel well, peel and place in sun for a couple of 
days, turning them several times; take in, wash 
in hot water, draining at once; put the figs, a few 
at a time, in a rich syrup and let cook for several 
hours, until thoroughly preserved. In this process 
the figs remain whole and are a most dainty 
offering. 

FARNUM PRESERVES 

Split the figs twice, crosswise, from blossom and 
about half-way. Put them in a dish and cover 
with cold water in which a full tablespoonful of 
medium -strong lye has been dissolved. Leave the 
figs in this solution for thirty-six hours, stirring 
every two or three hours. Take them out and rinse 
well, first in cold water, then in warm (not boil- 
ing) water, then in cold water, then in hot water, 
and again in cold water. In the meantime, have 
your syrup boiled with cinnamon and a few cloves 
in a bag for seasoning. Boil the figs slowly in the 
syrup for four hours, or until the figs are trans- 
parent. 

T. B. W. PRESERVES 

Soak the figs over night in moderately strong 
a him -water. Next morning, to one pound of figs 
add three-quarters of a pound of sugar (preferably 
brown;; let stand until the sugar becomes moist, 
then put in to cook. When the figs turn a light 
brown, put them on a platter in the sun for 
twenty minutes (allowing the syrup to still boil, 
but slowly;; then put the figs back in the kettle 
and cook until they take on a dark brown color. 
Some like the flavor of ginger or orange peel, but 
the preserve is delicious with but the flavor given 
by the fig. 



THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



MICHAELI PRESERVES 

Peel enough figs to make a gallon of preserves; 
let stand over night, with sugar, to form their 
own juice. Next morning, cook the figs until nearly 
done; add a little more than a cupful of chopped 
walnuts, and a thinly- sliced lemon. This makes 
a fine filling for cakes, or a tasty spread for bread. 

PRESERVED FIGS WITH GINGER 

Ten pounds of fresh, ripe figs, not shriveled, are 
peeled of the thick, outside skin. As all figs are 
not peeled readily, a variety which peels must be 
selected. Take the peel of one orange or lemon, 
pare well, and use none of the inner white part 
or rag. Take one ginger root and shave it very 
thinly with a sharp knife. Boil the peel and the 
ginger until very tender in a separate kettle. In 
another kettle make a syrup of six pounds of best 
white sugar, enough of water to dissolve; add the 
juice of four oranges and one lemon or four 
lemons. When ready, add the decoction of the 
orange peel and ginger, but take care to first 
strain. Bring the syrup to a simmer, drop in the 
peeled figs and simmer under cover until clear 
and tender, which requires more or less time, ac- 
cording to the variety of figs used and their state 
of ripeness. 

No. 2. Pick before quite ripe, peel and put into 
dishes, with sugar, for twelve hours, usually over 
night; drain off juice into preserving kettle, and 
after coming to a boil put in figs for a short time; 
take up in dishes again and expose to sun while 
syrup is boiling down; then return the figs, and 
when they begin to look clear take up and ex- 
pose to the sun again while reducing the syrup to 
desired thickness; then return figs to syrup and 
let simmer gently for an hour, being careful not 
to have too hot a fire and thus burst the figs; use 
a pound of sugar for each pound of fruit. 

No. 3. Pick figs fully ripe, but not shriveled. 
Scald first in hot water, change water several times 
in order to draw out the milky juice. Pack figs 
in glass jars in rows and handsomely. Make a 
syrup of one cup of sugar to two of water. Pour 
over figs and steam for twenty minutes without 
rubber band. Then place on the rubber bands; 
steam for twenty- five minutes more with the cover 
lightly pressed down. A very superior article is 
made if the figs are first steamed in a colander 
until tender, then packed in glass and steamed 
with the syrup. An apricot kernel or a bitter 
almond may be added to each jar, or, better, grated 
and boiled with the syrup before pouring over the 
figs. No more than one kernel is needed for each 
jar.

A DRIED-FIG DAINTY 

Take three pounds of dried fig's and wash them; 
cover with hot water and soak over night: next 
morning- drain oft' the juice; add one pound of 
sugar and heat until the sugar is dissolved; add 
the figs, and boil slowly until the juice has thick- 
ened to a syrup. If the figs have taken up the 
juice, add enough hot water to provide a sufficient 
syrup for the figs. Put in jars while hot. This 
will keep indefinitely. 

FIG TRANSPARENCIES 

Six quarts of figs, four pounds of sugar, one 
cupful of bakingr soda, six quarts of boiling- water, 
three quarts of water. Select firm, sound fruit, 
discard all over-ripe or broken figs. Sprinkle one 
cupful of baking soda over the selected figs and 
cover with about six quarts of boiling water. Allow 
them to rtand for fifteen minutes, drain off this 
soda solution, and rinse the figs well in clear, cold 
water. Let the figs drain while syrup is being 
prepared. Mix sugar and the three quarts of water, 
boil for ten minutes and skim. Add well-drained 
figs gradually so as not to cool the syrup. Cook 
rapidly until the figs are clear and tender about 
two hours. When the figs are transparent, lift 
them out carefully and place in shallow pans. If 
the syrup is not heavy enough (testing to about 50 
to 55 degrees with a saccharometerj, continue boil- 
ing until it reaches the desired density, then pour 
it over the figs, being careful to see that the fruit 
is entirely covered. Let stand over night. Next 
morning pack the figs cold in sterilized jars, having 
stems all the same length and placing the figs so 
that all stems will be upward. Fill each jar to 
overflowing with the syrup of 55 degrees density. 
Cap, clamp, process and seal immediately. 

SAN JOAQUIN SWEETS 

Heat fresh figs through thoroughly in a steamer, 
double boiler or slow oven without water, then 
drop them into a heavy, boiling syrup; remove and 
let stand in it over night. In the morning bring 
to a boil, remove; let stand till cold; re-heat :{ 
drain; pack figs close together in jars; cook down 
the syrup and pour over the fruit. Figs may be 
preserved in lemon syrup, in grape-juice, or other 
tart fruit juices, or have added to them lemon 
peel and juice or lemon and ginger root. 

Dried figs may be steamed and then so pre- 
served or by the simpler process. Many people 
hold that preserved figs must first be dipped in 
boiling lye, repeating several times, a minute at a 
time.

THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



VROOMAN PRESERVES 

Gather the figs with the stems on just before 
they are ripe enough to be eaten. Scrape off the 
skin carefully and drop the fig's into a kettle of 
clear, boiling- water, and leave half an hour. Then 
take out and allow to cool with the stems up. 
Make a syrup of a pound and a half of sugar and 
a half -pint of water to each pound of fruit. Boil 
the syrup till nearly roping; put in the figs care- 
fully and keep them under the water while cooking. 
If other than the natural flavor is desired, put a 
clove in the blossom end of each fig or cook them 
with a sliced lemon from which the seeds have 
been removed, adding a little ginger. The pre- 
serves keep well if made with an equal weight of 
sugar and figs.

FIG JAMS AND JELLIES 



SEYMOUR JAM 

Take large, firm figs, remove hard stems, cut 
into quarters. For each pound of figs use one-half 
pound of granulated sugar; dissolve the sugar in 
a little water before adding to the figs. Let the 
water and sugar boil up once or twice, then add 
the figs, and boil steadily until the jam coats the 
spoon and drops from it in heads; then pour into 
hot jelly glasses. 

A DOROTHY JAM 

Take very ripe figs, peel and place in a granite 
kettle; to two parts of figs add one part of sugar 
and mash thoroughly together with a potato 
masher; place over a slow fire; cook gently for a 
long period, stirring frequently. An asbestos mat 
under the kettle is a satisfactory safeguard. 

THOMPSON JAM- 
TO five pounds of figs, poeled and cut Into small 
pieces, add three and three-quarters pounds of 
sugar, and let stand over night. In the morning, 
take a lemon, remove the seeds, cut in thin slices, 
put in foiling water to remove the bitter taste, 
then add the lemon to the figs and boil until the 
ingredients drop from the spoon like jelly. 

JEANETTE JAM 

Boil sweet, dried figs with some syrup till all 
the juice is thick and sirupy, then run figs, syrup 
and all, through some kind of a mill that will grind 
it into a paste. A small sausage grinder is best 
one that grinds fine. This paste is fine for use 
wherever a jam can be used, and can be made 
more easily than any other jam or jelly.

GELATINED FIGS 

Prepare the figs by stewing-. Chop very fine. 
Have ready a half -box of gelatine; put this over 
the fire in a cup of boiling- water, add the sweet- 
ened fig 1 syrup, stir until the gelatine is thoroughly 
dissolved, take from the fire, add a wineglassful 
of sherry and stir in the minced figs. Turn into 
a mould wet with cold water to form. 

EASY-ENOUGH JAM 

Six pounds of purple figs (fresh), peeled and cut 
in half; two pounds of sugar. Cook until thick 
and seal hot. 

JUBILEE FIG JAM 

Select ripe figs, remove all stems, treat them 
with a scalding soda solution and rinse thoroughly 
in clear, cold water. Cook in quantities not larger 
than three pounds at one time. Allow one and 
one-half pounds of sugar to each three pounds of 
figs. Add barely enough water to start the cook- 
ing (about one-half cupful), crush the figs, heat 
to boiling and add the sugar. Cook rapidly to 220 
degrees Fahrenheit. To seal properly and to insure 
safety from mold, it is necessary to process all 
preserves after packing them into the sterilized 
jars. This processing may be done in a water-bath 
by heat below or at the boiling temperature, de- 
pending upon the kind of products packed and 
upon the length of time the heat is applied. Since 
preserves contain so much of sugar which acts as 
a preservative, it is only necessary to process 
against molds. This may be accomplished by 
placing the filled jars in a water-bath, heating it 
to a temperature of 180 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit, 
and holding that temperature for about thirty 
minutes. 

Process preserves or jams in twelve-ounce or pint 
jars for twenty minutes at 180 degrees Fahrenheit 
(temperature of simmering water). When jars 
with glass tops and screw caps or wire clamps 
(lightning seal) are used, leave the pressure of the 
clamp on the top of cap until the jars are entirely 
cold. 

FIG JELLY 

Slice the fresh figs into the preserving kettle, 
covering bottom of kettle with cold water. Add 
slices of unpeeled lemon, one lemon to one and 
one-half pints of uncooked figs. Place on back of 
stove to cook slowly an hour; then strain and boil 
for fifteen or twenty minutes (according to the 
state of the syrup), adding three-fourths quantity 
of sugar to that of the fruit.

THE J. C. FORKNER FIG GARDENS RECIPES 



LITTLE GEM JAM 

If the figs are dried, first steam till very soft. 
If fresh and ripe, place them in a double boiler, 
heating- through perfectly but adding no water. 
They may be steamed instead. Add about one-half 
their weig-ht of sugar and cook down carefully till 
thick. Lemon-juice and peel, pineapple or other 
decided upon fruit may be added for flavoring-. 
This if preferred may be rubbed through a coarse 
sieve and heated again before sealing- in little pots 
or jars.

FIG PUDDING No. 1 

Soak a cupful of bread-crumbs in a cupful of 
milk for a half-hour. Chop enough suet to make 
a quarter of a cupful; beat three eggs light; cut 
into tiny bits a sufficient number of soaked fig's to 
make a cupful of the minced fruit. 

Turn the soaked crumbs into a bowl, and stir 
into them a half-cupful of granulated sugar, the 
whipped eggs, the powdered suet, a pinch of salt 
and a dash, each, of cinnamon and nutmeg-. Last 
of all, stir in the minced fig's thickly dredg-ed with 
flour, beat well and turn into a greased pudding- 
mold with a closely-fitting- top. Boil for about 
three hours. Turn out and eat with a hard sauce.

soft. Into the crumbs stir five eggs, beaten light; 
a half-cupful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, and 
the cupful of minced figs thoroughly dredged with 
flour. Beat hard for several minutes, and turn 
into a greased pudding mold with a close top. Set 
in boiling water and cook three hours. Dip the 
mold into cold water for an instant, then turn the 
pudding out upon a hot platter. Set in the oven 
long enough for the moisture to dry from the out- 
side of the pudding. Three minutes in a hot oven 
should suffice. Send to the table and eat with a 
hard sauce flavored with a little nutmeg. 



BREAD AND FIG PUDDING 

Cut figs into small dices. Make a custard by 
heating a cupful of milk and pouring it upon four 
eggs, beaten light, with six tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
then cooking it until it is just thick enough to coat 
the spoon. Dip crustless slices of bread for a 
second in milk; put a layer of them into a pudding- 
dish, cover with the fig- dice, and pour over all the 
hot custard. Then put in more bread, more figs 
and custard, and proceed until the dish is full. 
Wait a moment for the bread to absorb some of 
the custard, and pour the rest of the hot liquid 
into the dish until it is full to the brim. Cover 
the dish and bake until the custard is set; uncover 
and brown.' Serve as soon as baked. Eat with a 
hard sauce.

FIG STEWS & STEAMS 



STEWED FIG FAVORITES 

Figs may be stewed in three different ways, if 
the dried fruit is used: 

1 Wash figs and place in cold water over night, 
using a pint of water to a pound of figs. Next 
morning bring the figs (in same water) slowly to 
a boil and when tender add half the quantity of 
sugar that there is juice, cooking down until the 
syrup is thick. Serve cold with cream. 

2 Stem the figs till soft, then place them in boil- 
ing syrup for a moment, setting them back where 
they will not even simmer, for twenty minutes or 
more, when remove the figs, cook down syrup till 
thick and pour it over the fruit. 

3 Wash and cover the figs with wine, letting 
stand over night. Then barely simmer till tender, 
treating the syrup as above. 

Fresh figs require simply to simmer for a few 
moments in a very little water before adding sugar, 
when let a syrup form before removing. Pineapple, 
ginger, lemon, rhubarb or other fruits may be used 
to flavor. 

STEAMED TASTIES 

One-third cup finely-chopped figs, one-half table- 
spoon sugar, one-fourth cup water, one teaspoon 
lemon-juice, few grains of salt. Cook figs, sugar 
and water two hours in top of double boiler. Add 
lemon-juice arid salt. Chill before serving. One- 
half tablespoon Sherry wine may be added if de- 
sired. 

A SAXON SUGGESTION 

One-half pound of figs, one pound of prunes, one- 
half pound of raisins. Cook prunes until soft, stone 
them, add the raisins and figs (which may be cut), 
boil a few minutes until soft. Can be used with 
nuts and rice as a pudding, or when cold as a 
spread for bread.

STEAMED FIGS 

This should be done always in closed but not 
tightened jars. Families may use a common wash- 
boiler, furnished with a loose inner perforated bot- 
tom of tin or galvanized iron, kept from the bot- 
tom by four stout legs soldered to the loose 
bottom. The space below the bottom is nearly 
filled with water. The jars, with fresh figs, are 
placed above, and finally over the boiler is put its 
regular cover. This is a much better way than 
boiling the figs in kettles of any kind over direct 
fire, as it prevents burning or mashing of the figs, 
saves handling, preserves the flavor, etc. 

CREAMED FIG STEWS 

Use the large, whole figs, usually seen in bags. 
Wash them in lukewarm water, then add fresh, 
cold water and let them soak until plump. Heat 
gradually and let them simmer until very tender 
Skim them out and boil down the syrup until 
thick, adding lemon- juice to remove the excess of 
sweet. Strain it over the figs and serve cold, with 
plain cream, or surrounded with whipped cream. 

A LOWNEY FAVORITE 

Wash the figs; cut in pieces; for each cup of figs 
add one-quarter cup of cold water; simmer one 
hour; add sugar and lemon-juice if desired. 

HUFFMAN HOUSE STEAMS 

Wash the figs in hot water, cut off the stems 
and blossom ends; place in a steamer or in a 
colander over hot water, cover tightly and steam 
from twenty to thirty minutes. Serve with or 
without cream. This is one of the most delicious 
ways of serving figs.

SANDWICHES 



HENSON SANDWICHES 

Six ounces of chopped figs; half a glass of water; 
one tablespoon of orange-flower water; whipped 
cream, violets and Angelica. 

Stew the figs until the water is absorbed; add 
the orange-flower water; cool and spread on 
wafers. Decorate with the cream, violets '|and 
Angelica. 

PEANUT-FIG SANDWICHES 

Chop fine a quarter of a pound of figs; add to 
them a quarter of a cup of water, and cook to a 
smooth paste; add one-third of a cup of peanuts, 
ground and mixed to a paste, with the juice of a 
lemon. When cold, spread on thin slices of bread 
or cake. 

FIG-NUT SANDWICHES 

Chop one-fourth pound of figs very fine, add 
one-fourth cup of water, and cook to a smooth 
paste; add, also, one-third cup of almonds, 
blanched, chopped very fine and pounded to a 
paste with a little rose-water, also the juice of 
half a lemon. When cold, spread the mixture upon 
lady-fingers or cakelets, white or yellow, press an- 
other above the mixture and serve upon a hand- 
some doyle-covered plate. Bread may be used 
instead of the cake. 

HURRY-UP SANDWICHES 

Chop dried figs until soft enough to spread be- 
tween thin slices of buttered bread. If good butter 
and wholesome white or brown bread are used one 
has a most satisfying luncheon, one that contains 
all the requirements of fat, sugar, nitrogen, etc. 
One may substitute finely-chopped nuts for the 
butter, for variety, if one wishes.

CANNED FIGS 



CANNED FIG DROPS 

To three quarts boiling water add two heaping 
tablespoonfuls soda; now dip your figs in the water 
for one minute and skim them out; then wash 
them thoroughly in two or three waters, or until 
there is no color left in the water. To ten pounds 
of figs allow eight pounds of sugar; add just enough 
water to dissolve the sugar; when boiling hot drop 
in the figs, having first selected them with care so 
as to avoid any that are broken or over- ripe; let 
them simmer slowly two hours; now remove the 
fig-s and boil down the syrup quite thick; replace 
the figs; bring all to a boiling heat, after which 
they are ready for canning after the usual method. 
A few slices of lemon with its juice will improve 
it * flavor. 



A WINTER DELIGHT 

Figs for canning should be sound and firm. Treat 
them for a soda bath, as for preserving. Rinse 
through two cold-water baths, drain and cook for 
forty to sixty minutes in the syrup (two cupfuls 
of sugar, four cupfuls of water;. Cool, pack and 
cover with the syrup and process for thirty min- 
utos in quart jars. When canning in tin, the fiq-.? 
re-tain a better color and flavor if canned in 
enamel-lined cans.
