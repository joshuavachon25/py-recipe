FOREWORD 



Navy Department, 
Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, 
Washington, D. C, 1 July 191^5. 

The Cook Book of the United States Navy contains a summary 
of the principles of cookery, menu planning, and a comprehensive 
collection of recipes based on the newer knowledge of nutrition. 

Many of the recipes were suggested and tested by commissary 
personnel of the Navy, and all the recipes have been developed and 
tested for practical use in the Navy. 

Supplementary information which will be helpful to commissary 

personnel in preparing food of high standard is presented in tabular 
and other form. 

In an attempt to assist with some of the feeding problems of the 

forces afloat and at advance bases, more recipes for dry provisions 

have been added in this edition.

THE COOK BOOK OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY 



Food Preparation For the Mess 



Food purchased by the Navy is high 
quality food. To maintain this high 
quality from the time it reaches the Navy 
stores until it is served to the mess, the 
food must have careful and intelligent 
handling in preparation and service. 

Storage: Attention must be given to 
proper storage of the food when it is first 
received. The turnover of stored food 
should be carefully supervised so that the 
stores are moved in the same order as 
received. This has direct bearing on the 
condition of the food when issued for 
preparation. 

Perishable foods should be put imme- 
diately under refrigeration and kept re- 
frigerated until time for preparation. 

Study the Menu and Recipes: The 
menu and recipes for the week should be 
carefully studied daily to determine the 
length of time necessary for preparation 
and cooking. 

Preparation Period: The food should 
De prepared as near to the actual time for 
cooking as possible to prevent the loss of 
valuable vitamins and minerals. 

The period of time elapsing between 
preparation and service to the mess 
should be as short as possible. 

Have the Food Ready Just on Time: 
The actual cooking period should be com- 
pleted just a few minutes prior to the 
serving period, making allowances for 
time necessaiy to carve meats or give the 
finishing touches to the cooked product. 



Food that stands after cooking loses 
much of its fine flavor and nutritive 
value. 

Standing at room temperature, several 
hours at a time, also exposes the food to 
spoilage bacteria. Therefore, it is impor- 
tant to serve cooked food hot and imme- 
diately after it has been cooked. Approxi- 
mate cooking time is given in the recipes. 



Overcooked Food Becomes Wasted 
Food: To retain full flavor, best texture, 
and highest nutritive value, food should 
never be overcooked. Cook it only to the 
proper degree of doneness. 

Serve Hot Foods Hot and Cold Foods 
Cold: Hot foods allowed to cool and cold 
foods served warm are unappetizing and 
often become wasted food. 

Watch Appearance and Consistency: 
Attention must be given to the appear- 
ance of the meal after it is prepared and 
to the manner of service of the food. This 
is especially helpful to morale. Make the 
food look attractive. Combine foods that 
are contrasting in texture and color. 
Avoid having foods all the same color and 
of similar texture in one meal. 

Parsley for garnish, when available, or 
a dash of paprika for color, adds eye ap- 
peal and stimulates interest in the food. 

Taste Each Dish Before Serving: Ex- 
tra seasoning may be necessary before 
serving. 

I* 



Place Food on Serving Tray Carefully: 
Food should be carefully portioned before 
service, then placed on the serving tray 
with care as the men pass by the service 
counter. 

Keep Cooking Equipment Clean: It is 
important that cooking equipment be 
kept scrupulously clean. Be sure that 
thermostats and thermometers are care- 
fully checked at periodic intervals. 

Cook Vegetables in Small Quantities: 
To conserve the natural color, texture, 
flavor, and nutritive value of fresh vege- 
tables, they must be cooked in relatively 
small quantities. As soon as they have 
cooked for the required length of time, 
they should be removed from the kettle 
and served immediately. 

The cooking of vegetables should be a 
continuous process until everyone has 
been served. 

Canned Vegetables: Since canned vege- 
tables have been precooked they need only 
be heated to boiling temperature before 
serving. Excessive heating of canned 
foods at high temperatures will not only 
reduce the nutritive \alue but will also 
cause a decrease of palatability and ap- 
pearance. It is preferable, therefore, to 
prepare the vegetables in small batches, 
rather than heat enough for the whole 
mess at one time and hold at a high tem- 
perature throughout the feeding period. 

Prepare Just Enough Food to Be Con- 
sumed at Each Meal: The amount of food 
necessary for any given mess will vary 
in accordance with the care used in its 
preparation, the other foods on the menu, 
the likes and dislikes of the men to be fed, 
the care with which the food is served and 
the number of men present at each meal. 

Absenteeism has a direct bearing on 
the amount of food necessary for the 



mess. Food should be prepared for the 
number of men who ivill be present at 
mess, not for the number assigned to the 
mess. 

For these and other reasons, the 
amount of issue on a particular item may 
actually be less than the amount called 
for in the recipe. 

Also, a large mess serving 1000 men 
will use less food than 10 messes each 
serving 100 men. To conserve food and 
avoid great amounts of leftovers, the fol- 
lowing reductions are recommended : 

For messes of 500 to 1000 men, reduce 
the amounts of ingredients in the 
recipe 5 per cent. 

For messes of 1000 men or more, re- 
duce the amounts of ingredients in 
the recipe 10 per cent. 

The recipe for Knickerbocker Bean 
Soup, based on the requirements for 100 
portions, is given as an example showing 
the quantities required for a mess of 1,000 
men. 

This calculation is made by multiply- 
ing each ingredient by 10 to obtain the 
amount required for 1000 portions on the 
100 portion basis. 

Since messes of 1000 or more men can 
effect savings of approximately 10 per 
cent, the quantity of ingredients required 
will be the amount calculated, less 10 per 
cent. For example, 7 pounds of beans, 
the quantity required in the Knicker- 
bocker Bean Soup recipe for 100 portions, 
multiplied by 10 amounts to 70 pounds. 
This amount, 70 pounds, less 10 per cent, 
or 7 pounds of beans, is equal to 63 
pounds, the quantity of beans required 
for a mess serving 1000 men. 

Note how this recipe should appear 
when the amount of issue for 1000 men 
is inserted in the blank column reserved 
for this purpose.

Sanitary Aspects of Food Preparation 



The bacteria now recognized as being 
responsible, in most cases, for wliat is 
known as "Food Poisoning," are present 
even under sanitary conditions. They pro- 
duce a poisonous substance (called toxin) in 
the food, which when eaten, causes serious 
illness. 

These bacteria grow and multiply rapidly 
in warm temperatures, 65° F. to 115° F. 
during which time the toxin is produced. 
A growth period as short as 5 hours has 
been found long enough for the bacteria to 
produce sufficient toxin to cause illness. It 
is possible that under favorable conditions, 
enough toxin can be produced in even a 
shorter period of time to make the food 
dangerous. The interval between the prep- 
aration and serving of food should, there- 
fore, be kept at a minimum. 

Foods Most Susceptible 

The foods which seem to be most sus- 
ceptible to the development of bacterial 
food poisons are ham, chicken, turkey, 
chopped cooked meat and egg for sandwich 

fillings, cream fillings, custard filled puffs 

and eclairs, bread puddings, beef hash and 
tongue. 

Dehydrated foods, during and following 
reconstitution, are also susceptible. Care 
should be taken not to allow the reconsti- 
tuted products to remain at warm room 
temperatures more than 3 hours from the 
time water is added for reconstitution until 
time for serving them. 



Quick-frozen foods which have been de- 
frosted are highly perishable, and they 
should be used immediately after being 
defrosted. 

Necessary Precautions 

Cooked Ham and Other Meat: Cooked 
meats, when placed on a steam table, must 
be kept at a temperature of 130° F. or 
above. 

Meat to be held after cooking should be 
placed in a refrigerator as soon as it is cool 
enough to handle. To insure that the meat 
is cooled rapidly, it should be placed in 
shallow pans and so arranged as to provide 
for adequate circulation of the cool air. 

Bread Pudding and Cream Fillings: Bread 
puddings, custards, eclairs, pies and other 
desserts with cream fillings should be 
covered and placed in a refrigerator until 
serving time. In hot weather they should 
not be prepared at all. 

Plan Meals To Avoid Having Left-overs: 
Meals should be so planned that left-over 
food is reduced to a minimum. However, if 
there are left-overs, they should be refriger- 
ated as soon as possible. 

Hot left-over food should be placed in the 
refrigerator as soon as it is cool enough to 
handle. Cold food should be placed in the 
refrigerator immediately following the serv- 
ice of food to the mess. All left-over food 
should remain in the refrigerator until time 
to prepare it for the rneal. It should be 
used within 36 hours. 



• 4 



Sandwich Fillings: Sandwich fillings made 
from ham, tongue, fried egg, egg salad, 
sausage and fish must be prepared quickly 
and just previous to making the sandwiches. 

If the fillings need to be made 2 to 3 hours 
before using the sandwiches, place the filling 
in a refrigerator imimediately after making 
it and keep refrigerated until time to make 
the sandwiches. Cover the sandwiches with 
wax paper instead of covering them with a 
damp cloth. 

Keep Time Short Between Preparation 
and Serving: Cut the length of time between 
preparation and serving to the minimum. 
Food should always be served immediately 
after it has reached the right degree of 
doneness, if possible. If the food must be 
held, no more than 4 hours should elapse 



after removal of food from heat. The tim- 
ing should begin at this point and not after 
the food has been sliced or otherwise pre- 
pared for service. 

Cleayiliness Is Imperative: All cooking 
and mess equipment must be kept scrupu- 
lously clean at all times. See that the dish- 
washing water is at a temperature of at 
least 120° F. to 140° F. and that the temper- 
ature of the rinse water is held at approxi- 
mately 180° F. to 210° F. 

Hands and clothing of all personnel han- 
dling food must be kept scrupulously clean 
at all times. Careful inspection is necessary 
to eliminate any men with infections. Per- 
sonnel should be cautioned against sneezing 
or coughing in spaces where food is pre- 
pared and served.

Nutritional Value of Foods 



The modern knowledge of nutrition 
indicates that foods serve specific func- 
tions in the body. Therefore, men need 
foods of different types in adequate quan- 
tities. All materials for building and 
maintaining strong, active bodies must 
be secured from the dairy products, eggs, 
fruits and vegetables, meats, and cereal 
products which are issued to the mess. 

Abnormal supply conditions may make 
it necessary to substitute some foods for 
others. It is essential, therefore, to know 
which nutrients are required and which 
foods are richest in these nutrients. 

The four cornerstones of the diet are 
proteins, vitamins, minerals, and energy- 
producing factors, all of which are essen- 
tial to the maintenance of health. 



PROTEINS 

The substance in foods which are 
called proteins merit their name which 
means "to take first place." They fur- 
nish essential building and repairing 
material for muscles and tissues of the 
body and enter into many, if not all, of 
the body functions. They also furnish 
energy. 

Protein from animal sources in gen- 
eral is superior to protein from vegetable 
sources. Best sources: Milk, eggs, meat, 
fish, and poultry. Other sources: Dried 
peas and beans, cereals, and vegetables. 



VITAMINS 

Vitamins are definite chemical sub- 
stances present in food in minute quanti- 
ties. They are necessary for growth and 
the maintenance of normal body functions. 
The effects of vitamins on health are 
spectacular. There are several known 
vitamins which must be adequately sup- 
plied in the diet. All are essential for 
good health, but each has certain special 
functions. A brief summary of the func- 
tions and sourcfes of the better known 
vitamins is herewith presented. 

Vitamin A 

An adequate intake of vitamin A is 
necessary for normal resistance to infec- 
tions and better vision in dim light. It 
may therefore be particularly important 
for all seamen standing night watches 
and for flyers. Best sources: Butter, 
liver, egg yolk, cheese, fish liver oils, yel- 
low and green vegetables, and fruits. 

Vitamin 67 

Vitamin Bi (thiamin) affects mor^e 
and disposition, helps to prevent fatigue, 
maintains appetite, healthy nerves, and 
normal muscle action. This vitamin is 
destroyed by excessive heat. It is readily 
soluble in water and therefore is par- 
tially lost if cooking water is discarded. 



• 6 



Best sources: Liver and kidney, lean 
meat, especially pork, beans and peas, 
cereals with whole grain value, enriched 
flour, nuts, milk, and eggs. 

Riboflavin 

Riboflavin is essential to growth and 
normal nutrition for all ages. Deficiencies 
may result in digestive disturbances, nerv- 
ous depression, general weakness, and poor 
conditions of the eyes and skin. Riboflavin 
is soluble in water and is destroyed by light. 
Best sources: Milk, lean meat, eggs, liver, 
green vegetables, peas, and beans. 



Niacin 

Niacin, a third water-soluble vitamin, 
prevents the deficiency disease called 
pellagra which is usually manifested by 
skin disorders, and in severe stages, men- 
tal disturbances. Best sources: Liver, 
lean pork, salmon, whole grain cereals 
and enriched flour, milk, and eggs. 

Vitamin C 

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid), "the sail- 
or's vitamin" prevents scurvy, that 
scourge of long voyages in olden days 
which is now reduced because of better 
methods of food preservation such as 
canning and cold storage. 

This vitamin is necessary to maintain 
the health of teeth and gums, to aid in 
resistance to infections, to prevent list- 
lessness and fatigue and to maintain 
the strength of the bony structure and 
of the walls of the blood vessels. It is 
soluble in water and is partially de- 
stroyed by cooking, this loss being less in 
acid fruits and tomatoes. Best sources: 
Citrus fruits, raw vegetables, fresh fruits 
and fruit juices, tomatoes, raw or canned. 
Other sources: Green vegetables and po- 
tatoes, if not overcooked. 



Vitamin D 

Vitamin D is concerned with the ef- 
ficient utilization of calcium and phos- 
phorous in the normal development and 
growth of the bones and teeth. Best 
sources: Fish liver oils, egg yolk, liver, 
and irradiated food. Sunshine affects the 
skin in such a way as to produce vitamin 
D which is utilized in the same manner 
as vitamin D from food. 

Although there may be requirements 
for other less well known vitamins, a 
well rounded diet that provides sufficient 
amounts of the vitamins listed above will 
in general supply these in adequate quan- 
tities. 

MINERALS 

Certain mineral elements are needed 
by the body for growth and maintenance 
of body structure and processes. Some 
of these are so widely distributed in foods 
that they are usually supplied in suflft- 
cient amounts in any diet. Calcium and 
iron, how^ever, may be too low unless care 
is taken in food planning. 

Calcium 

Calcium, combined with phosphorous, 
furnishes the material from which bones 
and teeth are built, aids in the clotting 
of blood, and in regulating the action of 
nerves and muscles. Calcium is not quite 
as readily lost in cooking as are other 
minerals. Best sources: Milk, whole or 
skim (fresh, dehydrated), milk (evapo- 
rated), cheese. Other sources: Leafy vege- 
tables, molasses, dried beans, or soy beans. 

Iron 

Iron is required for the formation of 
the coloring matter of the red blood cells. 
Unless sufficient amounts of this sub- 
stance are present, the blood cannot effi- 
ciently carry oxygen to all parts of the 



7* 



body for the continuance of life. Best 
sources: Eggs, meat, molasses, green veg- 
etables, dried fruits, dried beans, whole 
grain cereals, and enriched flour. 

ENERGY. PRODUCING FOODS 

Active men need large amounts of 
energy, 3,000 to 4,500 calories per day. 
In a well balanced diet it is estimated 
that approximately 10 to 15 per cent of the 
calories should be derived from protein; 
55 to 70 percent fi'om carbohydrate and 
20 to 30 percent from fat. It is evident, 



therefore, that although protein is useful 
as an energy-producing food as well as 
for its muscle building function, the ma- 
jority of the energy is supplied from car- 
bohydrates such as starches and sugars 
and from fats. Best sources: Fats and 
oils; flour (bread, cakes, pastry), spa- 
ghetti, macaroni, rice and other cereals; 
sugar and sirups. 

Suggestions for applying the princi- 
ples of nutrition in a practical manner 
are presented in the following chapter 
on planning the menu. 



The Menu 



A menu is a food plan for a meal, a 
day, a week or longer. 

A balanced menu is a menu which in- 
cludes the foods required by the body for 
most efficient functioning. 

Planning the menu, therefore, should 
be of primary importance to the commis- 
sary personnel, for upon it depends, to a 
great extent, the health and morale of the 
men in the general mess. 

A Food Guide, specifying the basic 
foods required daily for a balanced menu, 
is included in this chapter. Study it care- 
fully. 

While the emphasis in menu planning 
is placed on the nutritive value of the 
food, attention must also be given to pro- 
viding meals which are interesting, at- 
tractive, varied, and satisfying. This is 
helpful in maintaining good morale. 

In addition to the main factors in- 
volved in planning the menu, many help- 
ful suggestions are included throughout 
this book in conjunction with recipes and 
with other explanatory material. 



PLANNING THE MENU 

First, Know the Foods Essential for Good 
Nutrition: It is important that the Nutri- 
tional Value of Foods (page 6) and The 
Food Guide (page 11) be studied before 
starting to plan the balanced menu. In- 
clude these foods in each day's menu. 

Check Your Menus: Be sure each food 
group in the Food Guide is represented 
in the menu. Emphasis is placed on the 
use of fruits and vegetables because of 
their valuable contribution of minerals 
and vitamins. 

Become Acquainted With the Recipes in 
This Book: The -numerous recipes developed 
and tested, particularly for Navy use, allow 
for a wide selection. The introduction to 
each section, and the notes and variations 
of the recipes contain helpful information 
for menu planning, food selection, and prep- 
aration. 

Study the "Tables'': They contain val- 
uable information which pertains to food 
planning. 



• 8 



Plan the Memos a Week in Advance: 
The Navy menu should be planned for 
an entire week sufficiently in advance to 
permit the ordering and receiving of re- 
quired stores. This practice will allow 
time for figuring costs and for an orderly 
planning of the week's work, which are 
important factors in controlling the pro- 
duction of food necessary for' a given 
mess. 



Consider Cooking Equipment: Plan 
meals which can be prepared with the 
cooking equipment available. This in- 
sures better prepared meals and often 
prevents waste of food through improper 
cooking. 

Use a Pattern for Planning 
the Day's Menu 



Observe the Food ''Likes and Dislikes'' 
of the Men: Observe the food habits of 
the men, their likes and dislikes. This is 
helpful in planning and estimating the 
amount of food required for the number 
of rations to be prepared. Food left un- 
eaten on the tray is wasted food. 

Include Contrasting Foods in Each 
Menu: Foods contrasting in texture, 
color, and flavor tempt the appetite, give 
eye appeal, and increase the palatability 
of the meal. 

Vary the Ways of Serving the Same 
Food: Avoid repetition. Become ac- 
quainted with the variations of the basic 
recipes. They offer a wide choice of ways 
to prepare a single food. 

Consider the Climate: Whenever pos- 
sible plan to sei^e cool, crisp, fresh foods 
and cool beverages in hot weather. 

Use Fresh Foods in Season: Whenever 
practicable, this should be done. Fresh 
fruits and vegetables in season, can often 
be purchased at a lower cost than pack- 
aged products. By using them, it is pos- 
sible to release processed products for 
ship and overseas use. Fresh foods pur- 
chased locally also help to relieve con- 
gestion in transportation. 



Breakfast 

Fruit: Fresh, frozen, evaporated, de- 
hydrated, or canned fruits or fruit juices 
are used for appetizing as well as nutri- 
tional reasons. In one form or another, 
fruit is a welcome starter for the day, 
but need not be served for breakfast if it 
would be more useful, in improving other 
meals. 

Cereal: Cereal is a fuel food and has 
the advantage of being a carrier for 
milk. Serve hot or cold cereal depending 
on the supply, the climate, food habits of 
the men, or need for variety. 

Main Dish: The main dish may be 
ham, bacon, eggs, sausage, creamed dried 
beef, fried mush, French toast, hot cakes, 
or other satisfying breakfast dishes. Do 
not have the same thing on the same day 
each week. If fried mush or French toast 
are on the menu, sirup, jam, or jelly 
should be served. 

Bread: The bread should be varied as 
much as possible. Toast, rolls, cornbread, 
biscuits, coffee cake, doughnuts, and pan 
bread are some suggestions. 

Jam or Jelly: Jam or jelly may be 
served in place of butter occasionally. 

Beverage: The beverage may be either 
milk, coffee, tea, or cocoa. 



9* 



Dinner 

Soup: Soup may be served at either 
the noon or evening meal, whichever one 
needs the extra nourishment. When a 
vegetable soup is on the dinner menu, the 
salad may be omitted if desired. Soup is 
one means of getting men to eat vege- 
tables. 

Meat: Meat is always popular. The 
•meat purchased by the Navy is of good 
quality. Many cuts are spoiled by poor 
cooking. Do not have meat cooked too 
long in advance of the service period. 
Study pages 110 to 120 for information on 
proper handling and cooking. 

Gravy: Gravy or sauce is usually 
served with meat. Good gravy is smooth, 
well seasoned, and not greasy. Serve hot. 

Vegetables: A leafy green or yellow 
vegetable besides potato is valuable be- 
cause of flavor, appearance, and vita- 
min content. See pages 278 to 283 for 
pertinent information on vegetable prep- 
aration. 

Relish: A relish may take the place of 
salad occasionally. Raw carrot strips, 
young onions, radishes, sliced raw tur- 
nips, chopped cabbage and green peppers, 
sliced cucumbers and onions, and pickled 
beets are suggestions. 

Salads: Salads may be made from 
meat, greens, vegetables, or fruits. Serve 
as cold and crisp as possible. 

Dessert: Dessert has a definite place in 
the menu because it gives a feeling of 
satisfaction. Many people crave sweets 
and are accustomed to having them at 
the end of the meal. Dessert adds cal- 
ories and will round out a light meal. 
Serve lighter dessert with a heavy meal. 

Beverage: This can be coffee, tea, cocoa, 
milk, or a fruit-ade. 



Supper 

Main Dish: Meat may or may not be 
used, according to supplies on hand. The 
supper meal is usually a lighter meal 
than dinner. This depends upon the ac- 
tivities of the crew. It should be heavy 
enough to keep the men from being hun- 
gry when they turn in at night. Combi- 
nations of meat and rice, macaroni and 
cheese, chili con carne, chop suey, 
creamed meat, thick chowders, baked 
beans, and similar dishes are excellent 
dishes to serve at the supper meal. 

The supper meal is also a good time to 
utilize leftovers from dinner, if there are 
any. They must be attractive and appe- 
tizing on their reappearance and, if pos- 
sible, completely changed. Combinations 
such as rice and stewed tomatoes, carrots 
and peas, cooked vegetables made into a 
salad, meat and potatoes for hash are a 
few examples of how leftover foods may 
be utilized. 

Salad: A salad fits well into the supper 
meal. A fruit or vegetable or a chef's 
salad with mayonnaise or cream dress- 
ing, when served in addition to the main 
dish, is satisfying and helps to balance 
the meal nutritionally. 

Dessert: If the supper meal is lighter 
than dinner, the dessert can be richer 
and one that yields more calories such as 
pastry or pudding. 

Beverage: Beverage can be a choice of 
coffee, milk, cocoa, tea or fruit-ade. In 
warm weather or hot climates, a cool bev- 
erage such as iced tea or a cold fruit-ade 
is preferable. 

The extent to which these patterns can 
be followed is affected by the variety of 
available supplies. These supplies are 
limited aboard ship by the amount of 
storage space and refrigeration.

Nutrition Highlights 



Milk furnishes protein of good quality, high 
content of calcium, phosphorus, vitamins A, 
riboflavin and considerable B, (thiamin). 

Cheese : Five ounces of American cheddar 
cheese is about equal to 1 quart of milk in 
calcium, phosphorus, and protein content. 

Eggs are especially valuable for their complete 
proteins, iron, phosphorus, and vitamin A. 

Butter is especially valuable for its vitamin A 
and fat content. 

Meat furnishes complete proteins, phosphorus, 
iron, Bi (thiamin), and riboflavin. Liver 
is especially high in vitamin A. 

Fish are important for protein and phos- 
phorus. Salt water fish furnish iodine. 

Legumes are chiefly important as a source of 
energy, proteins, phosphorus, iron, thia- 
min. Because they are not a source of com- 
plete proteins, legumes should be used only 
as a supplement and not as a total substitu- 
tion for the animal proteins. 

Cereals, with whole grain value, and bread, 
enriched, furnish energy, protein, bulk, 
iron, phosphorus and vitamins Bi, riboflavin 
and niacin. 

Fruits supply vitamins, minerals and bulk. 
Citrus fruits are high in vitamin C. 
Yellow fruits supply generous amounts of 
vitamin A. 

Vegetables furnish valuable vitamins, miner- 
als and bulk. Some more than others. 

Green and yellow vegetables are valuable for 
vitamin A and iron. Use the outer dark 
green leaves of lettuce and cabbage in salads 
and soups. 

To save nutrients, use water in which vege- 
tables are cooked for soups and gravies. 

Tomatoes, fresh or canned, are especially valu- 
able for their vitamin C. Use them often, 
fresh or canned. 



Note. — Other foods in form of desserts, 
sirups and sugar may be used to supplement the 

660951 0-45-2 



diet. Sugar supplies energy but makes no other 
dietary contributions. 

II* 



SUBSTITUTE FOODS OF SAME 
NUTRITIVE VALUE 

It may be necessary sometimes to sub- 
stitute one food for another in a planned 
menu. Certain factors will require con- 
sideration : 

1. Whether it is equivalent in nutri- 

tional value to the food origi- 
nally planned, and if not, the ad- 
justments necessary to make it 
so. 

2. The acceptability of the substituted 

food in relation to the other 
foods on the menu. 

A chart giving the nutritive values of 
the different classes of vegetables, and 
suggested substitutions, is listed in the 
section on vegetables (page 283). 



SAMPLE MENUS 



Bill of Fare for the G 



enera 



I M 



ess 



Each of these pattern menus is offered 
as a guide for planning the weekly Bill 
of Fare for the General Mess, aboard 
ship and ashore. 

These are balanced menus, planned to 
meet the nutritional requirements of the 
moderately active Navy man needing ap- 
proximately 3,000 to 4,500 calories daily. 

The suggested food selections and com- 
binations are based upon Navy food is- 
sues, ration allowances and recipes in 
this book. 

When the fresh or other foods sug- 
gested in the menus are not available, 
they should be replaced by canned and 
dehydrated or other foods of approxi- 
mately the same nutritional value.

General Information and Tables 



V^annei 

Commercially canned food is one of the most 
important types of preserved food used in Navy 
subsistence. 

Carefully selected and prepared food is 
packed in containers and heated to definite 
processing temperatures for the proper length 
of time. These temperatures and processing 
times are selected to destroy or inhibit the sub- 
sequent growth of such bacteria as may be 
present on the food when it is packed. There- 
fore, properly canned food should keep as long 
as the seal of the container, or the container 
itself, is not broken. 

If, however, the canned food should be stored 
at high temperatures, the bacteria which may 
not have been fully destroyed may become ac- 
tive and spoilage will result. As a precau- 
tionary measure, all canned food should be 
stored in a dry, cool place. High temperatures 
may also speed up corrosion of the cans and 



Foods 

cause the deterioration of the flavor and texture 
of the contents. 

Research studies show that the vitamin con- 
tent of commercially canned foods is relatively 
high. Vitamin A and carotene (provitamin A), 
vitamin D, riboflavin and niacin appear to be 
very little affected by the canning process. In 
the case of water soluble nutrients, part of the 
vitamins and minerals are contained in the liquid 
surrounding the food in the can. Therefore, to 
obtain full nutritional benefit from canned foods, 
the liquids should be reserved for use in sauces, 
gravies and soups or should be concentrated by 
rapid boiling to i^ or i^ the original volume and 
served with the food. 

Since canned foods have been fully cooked in 
the canning process, it is only necessary to heat 
them to boiling temperature just before serving. 
In this way, the vitamins are better retained, and 
the food is more attractive and palatable than if 
a long cooking period is used.

Dehydrated Foods 



Dehydrated foods are fresh foods from which 
water and the inedible parts such as peels, cores, 
seeds, stems and bones have been removed. 

The foods are thoroughly cleaned and then 
dried by scientifically controlled processes designed 
to retain much of the original food value, flavor 
and texture. 

Dehydrated products, because of their reduced 
weight and bulk, save considerable storage space 
and therefore are part of the food supply of the 
Navy. 

When stored in airtight, insect- and moisture- 
proof containers, dehydrated products will keep 
in moderate temperatures for indefinite periods 
of time. This is made possible because the 
moisture content has been reduced to a degree 
where the micro-organisms such as the yeasts, 
molds and bacteria, which cause spoilage in foods, 
cannot thrive. However, there are still some 
micro-organisms present on the food, in an inactive 
state, which remain inactive until moisture is 
restored to the product, at which time they again 
become active and may cause spoilage. It is 
therefore important that dehydrated products be 
kept free from moisture until they are ready to 
be used. 

Before they can be used for final preparation in 
a meal, it is necessary to restore them to as nearly 
their original state as possible. This is done by 
restoring to the product the approximate amount 
of water, through absorption, that was originally 
removed in the process of dehydration. This 
process of restoration is termed "reconstitution." 



Directions for reconstituting and using the 
product in various prepared cooked dishes will be 
found in individual recipes in this book, under 
their respective classifications. For example, the 
recipe for Buttered Beets, using dehydrated beets 
is given on page 292 in the Vegetable Section. 
The recipe for Applesauce, using dehydrated apple 
nuggets will be found on page 86, under Fruits. 

The dehydrated packaged soup mixes, espe- 
cially the bean and pea soups, are highly nutritious 
and in addition can serve as a base for soups to 
which fresh or canned vegetables and meat may 
be added. 

The flavor and palatability of dehydrated soups 
is definitely improved when meat stock instead 
of water is used as the liquid for reconstitution. 
Powdered bouillon or bouillon type products may 
be used for the preparation of meat stock when 
fresh meat and bones are not available. Recipes 
for the use of powdered bouillon are given on 
page 251. 

Dehydrated milk and dehydrated eggs are 
supplied in powdered form. Information on 
powdered eggs and milk, and conversion tables 
showing the equivalents of fresh and powdered 
milk and eggs are given on pages 20 and 21. 

As the process of dehydration is further devel- 
oped, changes in the methods of reconstituting 
and cooking may be somewhat changed. There- 
fore, it is advisable to strictly follow directions 
which are supplied by the manufacturer for his 
respective product. 



INFORMATION ON POWDERED EGGS 



Powdered eggs are fresh eggs from which water 
has been removed in the drying process. 

The food value of fresh and powdered whole eggs 
is approximately the same. 

After reconstitution, powdered eggs may be 
used in the same way as fresh eggs. They must 
be treated the same as fresh eggs removed from 
the shell. Never let reconstituted eggs stand 



more than 1 hour unless they are refrigerated 
Powdered eggs vary in density. Some are more 
fluffy than others. It is desirable to use weights, 
if scales are available, as it is difficult to obtain 
exact amounts by measuring. Be sure that all 
measurements are level. 

In recipes where dry ingredients are sifted 
together, powdered egg can be mixed with the 



(9* 



dry ingredients. The water required to recon- 
stitute the eggs should then be added to the other 
liquid in the recipe. This is important. 

Always store powdered eggs in a cool, dry place 
in a tightly covered container, as they absorb 
moisture when exposed to air. Held at refrigera- 
tor temperature (50° F.) or below, powdered 



eggs (5% moisture content) should give satis- 
factory results for at least 1 year. Held at high 
temperatures (80° F. or above) powdered eggs 
soon become dull and dark in color and develop 
rancidity and off-flavors. Powdered eggs of low 
moisture content (2%) are more resistant to 
deterioration from storage at higher temperature-

Sprinkle powdered eggs into cold water, stir- smooth. Never add hot water to powdered eggs. 



INFORMATION ON POWDERED AND EVAPORATED MILK 



The formulas and recipes in this book specify 
liquid milk. 

Milk may be supplied in the form of fresh liquid 
milk, powdered whole and evaporated milk recon- 
stituted with water to give an approximate equiva- 
lent of fresh milk. 

After reconstitution, powdered or evaporated 
milk can be used in exactly the same manner as 
fresh milk. No change is necessary in formula 
or recipe. 

Storage 

Always store both powdered skim milk and 
powdered whole milk in a tightly covered con- 



tainer in a cool, dry place. Held at refrigerator 
temperature (45° F. or below), powdered skim or 
whole milk of good quality can given satisfactory 
results for almost 1 year. Held at high tempera- 
ture (80° F. to 90° F.), powdered whole milk, 
because of its fat content, may develop rancid 
flavors rather quickly. Powdered skim milk, in 
time, will develop off -flavors when stored at 
high temperatures. 

Evaporated milk may develop a musty off-flavor 
after storage for more than 18 months at room 
temperature (70° F.). Small solid particles, gen- 
erally known as "milkstones" may develop. These 
have no detrimental effect on the use of the milk 
and are not harmful.

Quick-Frozen Foods 



Quick freezing is a method of preserving 
fruits, vegetables, fish, poultry and meat in the 
natural state, by subjecting the product to a 
low temperature for a relatively short period of 
time. 

Advantages of Using Quick 
Frozen Foods in the Navy 

They are packed in convenient-sized con- 
tainers which can be easily handled and stored. 

They have the appearance and flavor of fresh 
products. 

They retain a high per cent of their original 
vitamin and mineral content. 

They are uniform in size and quality. 

They are easy to prepare for cooking and 
serving. 

They save shipping space because practically 
all waste is eliminated before packing. 

Storage: All frozen foods are perishable and 
should be placed under refrigeration immedi- 
ately upon delivery. The refrigeration tempera- 
tures for the various products should be about 



0° F. to 8° F. if to be kept for any length of 
time. 

Good circulation of air around the containers 
is important. 

The arrangement of cartons should also be 
given careful consideration. Products to be used 
first should be placed so they can be easily and 
quickly procured. 

Defrosting : The length of time necessary for 
defrosting is dependent upon the type of prod- 
uct and size of the container. In general, vege- 
tables need not be defrosted. Meat and poultry 
need defrosting so that they may be prepared 
for cooking. Fruits are thawed but used while 
still cold. Defrosted products are highly perish- 
able and should be used immediately after they 
have been thawed. 

Cooking: Directions for preparing and cook- 
ing frozen vegetables, meats and poultry are 
given under their respective classification. 

Package Directions: Read carefully and fol- 
low exactly the directions printed on the con- 
tainer for storing, defrosting and cooking. This 
is important. 



INFORMATION ON FROZEN EGGS 



An equivalent amount of frozen whole eggs, 
frozen egg whites and frozen egg yolks may be 
used in place of fresh eggs or reconstituted 
powdered eggs. 

Whole eggs may be made from frozen whites 
and yolks by combining them in proportion of 



2 parts whites to 1 part yolks. 

Allow frozen eggs to thaw before using. 
Thawing should take place slowly without ap- 
plication of heat. When thawing is complete, 
use and treat the same as fresh eggs.

The Recipes 

Information 



Recipes are important. They are valu- 
able as a guide to menu planning and to 
the preparation of food of high quality. 

The recipes in this book have been se- 
lected and tested particularly for Navy 
use. They comprise a wide variety of 
foods based mainly upon the issues for a 
Navy ration. 

To obtain the desired results it is ad- 
visable to have a copy of the recipe at 
hand during food preparation. The 
recipe should be read several times in 
order to become thoroughly familiar with 
the contents before starting to prepare 
the food, and directions should be care- 
fully followed. 

WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT 
THESE RECIPES 

The recipes have been calculated on the 
basis of 100 portions. 

Blank Column 

A blank column on the right side of the 
recipe has been reserved for the commis- 
sary steward to insert the calculations 
needed for supplies which apply to his re- 
spective mess. On page 3, in the Knick- 
erbocker Bean Soup recipe, the use of the 
blank column is demonstrated. These cal- 
culations should be made in pencil so that 
changes can easily be made when necessary. 

Yield and Portion 

The yield for each recipe is given in 
weights or amounts (measures) and both 
are specified when considered necessary. 
This applies also to the individual por- 
tion. Because of the variability in equip- 
ment and conditions under which the 
food must be prepared, the approximate 

• 32 



weights and amounts, rather than the 
exact weights and amounts, are specified. 
If the size of the portions are too large, 
or too small, for a given mess, the size of 
the portions should be regulated to suit 
the needs of the men. 

Seasonings 

Seasonings have an important place in 
the Navy diet as they help to relieve mo- 
notony and make the food more palatable 
and interesting. 

A good cook uses seasonings wisely and 
varies them often. The amounts of 
seasonings included in various recipes 
throughout the book are on the "mild j 
side," designed to suit the average taste. I 
Over-seasoning is as undesirable as 
under-seasoning. Salt and pepper should 
be used with discretion. Seasonings such 
as parsley, green pepper, garlic, and 
pimiento may be omitted, when not avail- 
able, without affecting the flavor of the 
food too much. 

V/ eights and Measures 

Ingredients are designated in both 
weights and amounts (measures). The 
amount specified for each ingredient is 
comparable to its weight and should be 
used only when scales for weighing are 
not available. More accurate results can 
be expected if the ingredients can be 
weighed instead of measured. 

Amounts (measures) of ingredients 
are designated in teaspoons, tablespoons, 
cups, pints, quarts and gallons. 1 

The 8-ounce standard measuring cup I 
graduated in i/4's, i/^'s, and 1/2 's is used 
as a basis for the cup measurements. 

For ingredients using 1 cup (I/2 pint) 
or more, the amount is expressed in terms 
of pints, quarts, and gallons. 



Ladles, dippers and scoops, of definite 
measure, are also necessary for making 
accurate measurements (page 24). 

All ingredients in these recipes are 
based on LEVEL measurements. These 
must be made accurately in order to ob- 
tain best results. 

Tables of Weights and Measures are 
given on page 24. 

A. P. and E.P. 

A. P. refers to the net weight of a prod- 
uct "as purchased" in its natural state, 
parts of which are considered not edible. 

For example, the net weight of a crate 
of grapefruit is approximately 74 pounds, 
as purchased (A.P.). The peelings weigh 
about 29 pounds, leaving an "edible por- 
tion" (E.P.), of 45 pounds. 

Notes 

The NOTE appearing below the recipe 
contains valuable information pertaining 
to the recipe. It frequently contains sug- 
gestions on methods of preparation and 
should be carefully read before preparing 
the recipe. 



Variations 

Variations of the basic recipe are valu- 
able because they show how the basic 
recipe can be easily changed into a dif- 
ferent recipe by the substitution of one 
or more ingredients. Variations in this 
way help to relieve monotony in the diet. 

Each variation is listed in the index as 
a separate recipe. 

Time and Temperatures 

The length of time for cooking is given 
in each recipe, and should be carefully 
noted. This information is particularly 
helpful as a guide in meal planning. 

Specific temperatures for cooking and 
baking in the oven are also given. 

Tables containing general information 
on preparation and cooking-time for 
cereals, sauces, fruits, vegetables and 
meat are given in each respective section. 

These recipes have been developed and 
tested at altitudes less than 5,000 feet. 
The temperature of boiling water re- 
ferred to in these recipes is 212° F. 

Simmering temperatures range be- 
tween 180° F. and 210° F. 

Average room temperature is consid- 
ered to be 68° F. to 70° F.

Beverages 



Coff 



ee 



Roasted coffee is a delicate and perishable 
product. Whether ground or in the bean, unless 
vacuum packed in tin, coffee requires careful han- 
dling. It loses both flavor and strength on contact 
with air. 

Store coffee, tightly covered, in a cool, dry place. 
Avoid storing it near foods which have strong 
odors. Roasted coffee readily absorbs foreign 
odors, and these make themselves apparent in the 
finished brew. 

If coffee in the bean is procured for general 
mess use, grind only the quantity required just 
previous to using it each time the brew is made. 

Navy coffee has been expertly blended and 
roasted. If a few simple rules for making coffee 
are followed, a rich and enjoyable brew may be 
expected. 



'enera 



IRuL 



es 



Always use clean equipment. 

Rinse urn bag with fresh cold water before using. 

Measure coffee and water accurately. 

Use freshly drawn cold water which has been 

brought to a rapid bubbling boil for brewing 

coffee. 
Keep coffee covered while brewing. 
Hold finished coffee at temperature of 185° F. 

to 190° F. until served. Never allow finished 

coffee to boil. 
Remove grounds as soon as coffee is made. 

Seepage from coffee grounds impairs the good 

flavor and aroma. 
Use fresh coffee for each brew. Never use any 

portion of used coffee grounds a second time. 
Make coffee fresh as needed. Never allow 

more than an hour to elapse between mak- 
ing and serving the coffee. 



Care of Urn Equipment 



Keep all parts of um equipment scrupulously 
clean. 



Rinse um thoroughly with clear, hot water after 
each use. 

Wash urn twice every 24 hours using urn brush, 
hot water, and washing soda. Use approxi- 
mately 1 tablespoon washing soda for each 
quart water. Never use soap or soap powder. 

Rinse urn thoroughly several times with clear, 
hot water. Be sure that all traces of washing 
soda are removed. 

Remove coffee faucet on urn daily. Scrub all 
parts thoroughly with brush, hot water, and 
washing soda. Rinse throughly with clear, 
hot water. Insert long, thin coffee pipe brush 
and scrub inside of faucet pipe and plug at 
bottom of inner liner thoroughly. Rinse with 
clear, hot water. 

Clean gauge glasses at least twice each week 
using gauge glass brush, hot water, and wash- 
ing soda. Rinse thoroughly with clear, hot 
water.

Leave air space of 1 to 2 inches below neck. 

Moisten filter cloth and tie tightly over filter. 
Place in seat of funnel, or if using glass rod, 
place in position. Put in coffee. 

When water in lower bowl is boiling, insert 
upper glass bowl into lower bowl with slight 
twist so that a perfect seal forms at neck of 
bowl. Water will start going from lower to 
upper bowl almost immediately. As soon as all 
the water, except a small amount below bottom 
of tube, has risen, stir coffee well and leave on 
heat about 2 minutes longer. 

Remove from heat and place on rubber, as- 



bestos, or cork mat. As the bowl cools, a 
vacuum is created and the filtered coffee flows 
into the lower bowl in only a few seconds. 

Remove the funnel with a gentle side to side 
motion. The coffee is now ready to serve. Keep 
hot but do not allow it to boil. 

Note. — 1. Most of the vacuum-type coffee 
makers are made of glass, although there are 
some made of part glass and metal, all metal,, 
or part plastic.

Lemon Juice Powder^ Synthetic 



Navy issue lemon juice powder, synthetic, can 
be used satisfactorily, when properly reconsti- 
tuted with water, in place of fresh lemon juice 
specified in the recipes and bakery formulas. 
Three ounces lemon juice powder, synthetic dis- 
solved in 1 quart water is equivalent to 1 quart 
juice of fresh lemons. 



Composition 



This product is a mixture of dried pure lemon 
juice with corn sirup, dextrose, citric acid, 
ascorbic acid (vitamin C), tricalcium phos- 
phate, and oil of lemon. 

The synthetic powder will make six times as 
much beverage by volume as the straight lemon 
juice powder and will result in substantial sav- 
ing of space and containers. Sufficient ascorbic 



acid has been added so that a 12-ounce serving 
of the beverage will furnish approximately 60 
per cent of the daily requirement of vitamin C. 

It is not possible to incorporate sufficient oil 
of lemon in the powder to give the maximum 
desired flavor without impairing keeping quali- 
ties. Therefore, in using synthetic lemon juice 
powder in the bakery products, puddings and 
fillings specifying lemon juice, it is often desir- 
able to supplement the powder with additional 
oil of lemon. 

The addition of Navy issue lemon oil flavor- 
ing to puddings, custards, fillings and other 
products in which synthetic lemon juice powder 
is used, gives a more pleasing flavor. 

Use from V^ to 1 teaspoon of lemon oil flavor- 
ing to 1 pint of pudding or filling.

Breakfast Cereals 

Cereals and cereal products have an impor- 
tant place in the Navy menu, as they are a good 
source of food energy. 

In addition to furnishing food energy, the 
whole grain cereals and restored breakfast 
cereals supply valuable vitamins, minerals and 
protein. Some of the refined cereals have been 
restored by the manufacturers to the nutritive 
value of the whole grain cereals by the addition 
of minerals and synthetic vitamins. 

When cereals are served with milk, or milk 
and fruit, the protein, mineral and vitamin con- 
tent of the meal is desirably increased. 

There are three main types of breakfast 
cereals on the market: 



1. Regular Cereals 



This class includes rolled oats, corn meal, 
farina, cracked whole wheat and others which 
require complete cooking. These cereals are 
served hot. 



2. Quick-Cooking Cereals 

These cereals have been partially cooked be- 
fore packaging and require a relatively short 
period of further cooking before eating. These 
are also served hot. 

Cooked cereals may be used in meat loaves or 
added to soups. When placed into pans and 
chilled until firm, cooked cereals such as corn 
meal and farina may be sliced and fried and 
served with sirup, powdered sugar or fruit 
sauce. 



// 



3, Prepared or Ready to Eat 
Cereals 

These comprise the packaged, dry cereals 
made from grains such as wheat, corn, rice, 
barley and rye. They are fully cooked and flav- 
ored before packaging. They are available in 
different forms such as granular, flaked, puffed 
and shredded. 

If necessary or desirable, they can be reheated 
and recrisped by removing from the package 
and placing them into baking pans, in a slow 
oven (325° F.) about 5 minutes.

Macaroni/ Noodles^ Spaghetti 
and Rice 

Macaroni, noodles and spaghetti are made 
from a base of hard wheat flour. Some noodles 
contain egg in addition. 

Macaroni and spaghetti can be cooked in long 
sticks or in pieces, 1 to 2 inches long. If the 
ends of the long sticks are first dipped into boil- 
ing water, they will soften so that the entire 
mass can be gradually submerged and cooked in 
coils. 



Macaroni, noodles, spaghetti and rice need to 
be cooked in large amounts of rapidly boiling, 
salted water, using approximately 4 times as 
much water as cereal. The product should be 
drained well immediately after cooking. 

Macaroni, noodles, spaghetti and rice when 
combined with meat, cheese, eggs or milk can 
be used as a main dish. In this way, these 
cereals serve as an alternate for meat. A salad 
or one or two vegetables should be served in 
addition.

Desserts 



The dessert is important in both the dinner 
and supper menu. It rounds out the meal in a 
satisfactory manner and is one means of con- 
trolling the caloric content of the meal. 



Serve a light dessert with the heavier meal 
and a sweeter, richer dessert with the lighter 
meal. Recipes for pies, other pastries and cakes 
are found in the bakery section of this book.

IceC 



ce ^^re^m 



Ice Cream should be a "regular" on the Navy- 
menu. In addition to being one of America's 
favorite desserts, ice cream is nourishing and 
economical. 

The following directions, if carefully ob- 
served, will be helpful in producing ice cream 
of good quality. 

Keep the freezer, utensils used in measuring 
the ingredients, ice cream cans and all other 
equipment scrupulously clean and properly 
sterilized. 

Weigh or measure all ingredients accurately 
to insure uniformity, proper texture and pleas- 
ing flavor in the finished product. 

Follow directions carefully. 

It is important that the correct "overrun" 
be reached before the batch is drawn off from 
the freezer. The "overrun" which refers to 
the increase in volume, obtained by whipping 
air into the mix during the freezing process, 
may vary from 80% to 100%. An "overrun" 
of 100% is most commonly used in commercial 
practice. 

A simple way to determine "overrun" is as 
follows: Weigh 1 cupful of the original mix. 



deducting the weight of the cup. When it is de- 
termined that the proper "overrun" has been 
reached, weigh 1 cupful of the ice cream and 
again determine the net weight. If the weight 
of the ice cream is just 50% of the weight of 
the original mix, the proper "overrun" of 100% 
has been obtained. For example, if the cup of 
mix originally weighed 8 ounces, the sample 
taken just before the batch is drawn should 
weigh 4 ounces. Ice cream with too much 
"overrun" will melt rapidly and show many air 
bubbles in the melted product. 

Keep the blades of the freezer sharp and 
properly adjusted since faulty adjustment al- 
lows a thin layer of cream to freeze along the 
inside wall of the freezer. This tends to insulate 
the batch from the refrigerant and lengthens 
the freezing time and decreases the "overrun." 

Store the ice cream in a hardening cabinet or 
room at 10° F. below 0° F. 

When serving, have the dispensing cabinet 
at 6° F." Use a "rolling" motion with the scoop. 
Digging or pushing the scoop into the ice cream 
will compress it and reduce the number of 
servings cer gallon.

Combine the mix and water. Whip together 
at temperature ranging from 40° F. to 70° F. 
in an electric mixer or with a wire whip. Cool 
to 40° F. before placing in freezer. 

Fill freezer half full. Begin freezing at 15° 
F. below 0° F. 

Open wide the refrigerant valve. Allow mix 
to freeze from 3 to 6 minutes, depending upon 
the temperature of the refrigerant. 

Start to whip mix when hard enough to 
"string" across the opening in head of a per- 



pendicular freezer, or when it is slightly less 
than the consistency for drawing in a hori- 
zontal freezer. 

Turn off refrigerant. Whip mix 4 to 5 min- 
utes, to double the volume by incorporating 
air. If the temperature rises above 10° F. the 
mix may thin out. Open refrigerant valve until 
mix is hard enough to draw. 

When the maximum overrun is obtained, 
draw off immediately the thick ice cream into 
cans chilled in hardening cabinet to the same 
temperature as the ice cream when drawn.

of the water and add to mix with remaining 
water. 

2. Ice cream softens at 12° F. to 15° F. be- 
cause of the sugar content.

satisfactory for mixing the powder and water. 

4. Ice cream liquid mix may be held in a 
refrigerator for 8 hours or longer. 

5. Add fruits or fruit juices just before mix 
is drawn off. When fruits or chocolate are to 
be added, decrease the quantity of liquid mix by

Eggs 



Eggs are valuable not only for their excellent 
protein but for their contribution of vitamins 
and minerals, especially iron, calcium and phos- 
phorous. 

Because of their high nutritive value and ease 
in preparation and cooking, the Navy menu 
should be planned to include the equivalent of 1 
egg per man per day. 

Eggs may be prepared in various delicious 
ways and served as the main dish of the meal 
or used as an ingredient in sauces, salads, meat 
loaves and desserts. 

SOFT-COOKED EGGS

Cover completely with boiling water. 
Cook 3 to 5 minutes, according to desired de- 
gree of firmness. 
Drain. Serve immediately. 

HARD-COOKED EGGS

Turn on steam full. 
Steam 3 to 5 minutes for soft-cooked eggs and 

15 minutes for hard-cooked eggs. 
Remove from steamer. Serve immediately. 

Note. — To cool eggs quickly, plunge in cold 
water. 

POACHED EGGS 

Grease skillet. Fill with boiling water.

Fruits 



Fruits should appear frequently on the menu 
as they furnish important food essentials and 
also add variety, color and refreshing flavor 
to the meal. 

Fruits are supplied to the Navy in the fresh 
state or as quick-frozen, canned and dried. 

They fit into all three main meals of the day. 
They can be served at breakfast alone or in 
combination with cereal. For dinner or supper 
they may be used as a first course or as a salad 
or dessert. 

Fresh and canned fruits may be combined 
to vary flavor and texture. 

Fruit compotes, made of a combination of 
tw^o or three cooked fruits, make a pleasing 
light dessert for the main meal of the day. 

Fruit juices may be served as a first course 
at breakfast or in place of soup or as the main 
beverage of the dinner or supper meal. 

Discoloration and How to 
Prevent It 

Certain fruits, vi^hen peeled and cut, will dis- 
color readily when exposed to air even for a 
very short time, unless the cut surfaces are 
protected from direct contact with the air. 

Discoloration in apples and pears can be 
avoided by placing the cut pieces in a solution 
of salt and water for a very few minutes just 
before using, allowing 1 teaspoon of salt to 1 



quart of cold 
bananas and 
dipping the c 
with fresh or 
orange juice 
fruits should 
to use them, 
as rapidly as 



water. Discoloration in avocados, 
peaches can best be retarded by 
ut pieces into, or sprinkling them 
canned grapefruit juice, lemon or 
or canned pineapple juice. These 
not be peeled or cut until time 
Fully ripe fruit does not discolor 
under-ripe fruit. 



Storage 

Fruit is a perishable product and careful 
consideration should be given to storage. Some 
fruits require different temperatures and 
lengths of time for storage than others. 

Since fruit is at its best for flavor, texture 
and digestibility when fully ripe, it should be 
served when ripe and care should be taken in 
meal planning to use the fruit on hand which 
ripens first. 

To Fully Ripen Bananas 

To obtain fully ripe bananas, the green- 
tipped or the all-yellow fruit should be held at 
room temperature, 68° F. to 70° F., until the peels 
are well flecked with brown. 

In fully ripe bananas the starch has been 
converted into fruit sugars. Bananas are then 
at their best for flavor and digestibility and for 
use in fruit cups, salads, drinks, desserts, pies 
and all bakery products.

Fish 



Fish deserves a prominent place on the menu. 
It is an excellent source of protein. One average 
portion of fish will furnish, daily, M to 3^ the 
protein required by an adult. Fish also supplies 
important vitamins and minerals needed daily in 
the diet. 



Types of Fish 

The fat content of fish varies with the species 
and to some extent with the season. As a rule, 
fat fish are preferable for baking and broiling. The 
lean fish are best for boiling, steaming, and chow- 
ders. Both fat and lean fish can be fried. 



Cleaning and Preparing Fresh Fish 

Most fish have a season during the year when 
fresh varieties are particularly abundant. Al- 
though today's market provides almost any kind 
of fish, fresh or frozen, already cleaned and 
dressed, some information on cleaning and pre- 
paring fresh fish for cooking is desirable. 

How to Clean Fresh Fish 

Soak the fish in water for a few minutes. 
Scales are more easily removed from a wet fish. 
Remove from water. Hold the fish firmly near 
the base of the tail. Scrape off the scales with a 
scaler or a knife held vertically as it is moved 
over the fish, scraping from the tail toward the 
head, taking care to get off all scales near the 
base of the fins and head. 

Cut a slit in the belly of the fish from the 
head to tail. Remove the viscera. Cut around 
the pelvic fins and remove them. Cut off the 
tail. Cut off head, including pectoral fins, 
removing these with the head. 

Cut into the flesh of the fish at each side of the 
base of the large back fin. Grasp the rear part 
of the fin and give a quick pull forward toward 
the head of the fish. This will remove both fin 
bones and fin. The anal or ventral fin is removed 
in the same manner, first cutting the flesh around 
the fin. Fins should never be trimmed off with 
shears or knife. 



Wash the fish in cold running water, removing 
any remaining viscera and membranes. The 
fish is now ready for cooking. Large fish may be 
cut crosswise into steaks. 

To Fillet or Bone Fish 

With a sharp knife, cut down the flesh just 
behind the head until the knife reaches the back- 
bone. Turn the knife fiat and cut the flesh along 
the backbone to the tail. Lift off the whole side 
of the fish in one piece. Turn the fish over and 
loosen the meat from the other side in the same 
manner. Take out any small bones that remain 
near the shoulders after the fillets have been cut 
away. 

Cover fish bones and head with water. Heat 
to boiling temperature. Let simmer 1 hour to 
form a stock to use in fish chowders or fish recipes 
requiring a liquid. 

To Skin Fish 

Place the fillet with the skin side down on a 
fiat surface. Loosen the skin from the flesh at 
the tail end by pushing forward a sharp knife 
held flat against the skin. Grasp the separated 
skin and fiesh together and hold tight against the 
knife while loosening the skin. 

The fish need not be scaled first. 



Storage 



Fresh Fish: Fresh fish, including shell fish, 
are highly perishable and will spoil within a few 
hours if left exposed to warm temperatures. 

PYesh fish should be iced immediately after 
being caught and kept on ice until ready to use. 
It should not be kept longer than 2 to 3 days. 

Frozen Fish: Frozen fish may be held in cold 
storage for several months. 

Frozen fish should not be defrosted until ready 
to prepare for cooking. Never allow frozen fish 
to thaw and re-freeze. Follow instructions for 
defrosting as specified on the container. 

Salted Fish: Salting is a method of preserving 
fish, with relatively large quantities of salt. Salted 



93* 



fish may be purchased whole, in fillets or shredded. 
Some fish are lightly salted merely to preserve 
them for a short period of time until they reach 
the consumer. These can be de-salted and cooked 
in the same manner as fresh fish. Salted fish are 
perishable and should be stored in a clean, dry, 
cool place. 

Smoked Fish: Smoked fish are perishable and 
should be stored in a clean, dry, cool place until 
ready to use. 

Canned Fish: Canned fish will keep for an in- 
definite period as long as the seal of the can is 



not broken. Canned fish should be stored in a 
dry, cool place. 



Cooking 

Fillets and steaks are sometimes lightly salted, 
when packaged at the fisheries, in which case 
additional salt may not be required in cooking. 
Season, to taste, before serving. 

Cooked, left-over fish must be placed in re- 
frigerator as soon as cool enough to handle after 
serving. Use left-over fish within 24 hours.

Meat 



Meat is one of the most important compo- 
nents of the meal. It supplies a large propor- 
tion of the nutrients necessary in a well-bal- 
anced menu. 

In addition to its contribution of vitamins, 
minerals, protein and food energy, it has a dis- 
tinctive savory value. The appearance and 
aroma of a well-cooked piece of meat helps to 
stimulate the flow of digestive juices and is 
thus an aid to digestion. 



Storage of Meat 



Meat is a perishable product and must be 
treated as such. 

Place fresh meat under refrigeration im- 
mediately upon receiving it. Place it so that 
air can circulate freely around it. Store fresh 
meat at 32° F. to 34° F. 

Optimum temperature for storing frozen meats, 
either boneless or bone-in, is 0° F. or lower, 
preferably lower. 

Place left-over meat in a refrigerator as soon 
as it is cool enough to handle and definitely plan 
to use it within 24 to 36 hours. 

Smoked and salted meat should also be stored 
in a refrigerator. 



Selection of Cuts 

Make a study of the carcass so that it may be 
cut economically and advantageously. Cuts of 
meat differ in tenderness according to the loca- 
tion in the carcass. These differences make it 
desirable to use certain cuts for each method 
of cooking. 

Selection of cuts is possible in the Navy, 
because of the number of carcasses available. 
The use of all cuts, irrespective of tenderness, 
for a single purpose is neither necessary nor 
desirable. 

Choose, carefully, the cuts of meat for each 
respective use to obtain the most satisfactory 
results. Select the tender cuts for steaks, chops 
and oven roasts, the less tender cuts for brais- 
ing and stews, and the least tender for ground 
meat. 

If both tender and less tender cuts are used 
for the same purpose, the tender cuts are over- 
cooked and unpalatable before the less tender 



pieces are edible. In addition, it is not good 
economy to use a tender cut, which is expensive, 
when a less tender, less expensive cut will serve 
the same purpose and will give satisfactory 
results. 

Cut the pieces of meat for roasting or brais- 
ing of approximately uniform size so that the 
smaller pieces will not overcook before the 
larger ones are done. It is preferable to cut the 
pieces of meat for braising and roasting as 
large as possible, because this reduces the 
amount of shrinkage. If the pieces are not all 
the same size, put the largest cuts on to cook 
first. 

Cooking Temperatures 

A relatively low, constant temperature is 
recommended for cooking all cuts of meat re- 
gardless of the method. 

The advantages of using a low, constant 
temperature are: less cooking loss, more serv- 
ings, juicier meat, more tender meat, more 
uniform cooking, less fuel consumption al- 
though longer cooking time, less attention 
required and less splattering of the oven in 
roasting. 



Degree of Doneness 



Avoid overcooking meat. The longer meat is 
cooked the greater the shrinkage and loss in 
flavor and juiciness. 

The stage of doneness depends on the kind 
of meat and personal preference. 

A meat thermometer is recommended as the 
most accurate means of determining when 
roasted meat is done. The exterior appearance 
cannot be used as a guide to doneness. The 
thermometer should be inserted to the center 
of the largest muscle in the cut. The meat then 
is roasted until the thermometer reading indi- 
cates the desired degree of doneness. 

Carving Cooked Meat 

After cooking, let meat "set" about 30 minutes. 
This allows the meat to become firm. Hold the 
meat firmly and carve across the grain with a 
sharp knife. Keep the meat hot, before and after 
carving, when it is to be served hot. 



*t>0 



Time-Table 

Time-tables are based on the relation of time 
to weight, allowing a certain number of min- 
utes per pound of meat at a given temperature. 
They are useful for estimating the time at which 
meat must be started in order to be done in time 
for the meal. Time-tables will be found under 
the various methods of cooking. 

Seasoning 

Large cuts of meat may be seasoned at any 
time. The most convenient time is at the begin- 
ning of the cooking stage. Salt does not pene- 
trate more than 1 inch below the surface and 
any juices drawn out by it enrich the gravy. 
Salt will penetrate small pieces of meat fairly 
well. 

Boning 

It is desirable to remove bones in roasts 
before cooking to facilitate the carving of the 
cooked product. 

Larding 

To improve the flavor of lean cuts of meat, 
fat may be inserted into the meat with a lard- 
ing needle, or slices of cod fat, suet or pork fat 
back may be placed on the top of the cuts before 
cooking. 

FATS 

Fats are important sources of calories. All 
fat should be used to good advantage. Excess 
fat from carcass meat should be rendered. Drip- 
pings from bacon, sausage, lamb, pork, and 
beef should be strained and held in a refrigerator 
to use for cooking. 

Prepare Fat for Rendering 

Use Only Fresh Fat : Fat should be rendered 
daily. If fat must be kept over night, hold it 
in refrigerator in largest pieces possible. 

Trim Fat Carefully: Remove all lean meat, 
tough membranes, bones, cartilages, blood, and 
dirt. 



Cut Into Strips For Grinding: Strips of fat 
will feed through grinder more easily than 
cubes. Do nbt cut until ready to render. 

Grind Through Coarse Plate: Ground fat 
will render more quickly, render more uni- 
formly, and will provide 10 to 15 per cent more 
rendered fat. 

Render Immediately: Ground fat and small 
pieces of fat are highly perishable and should 
be rendered promptly. 

Where to Render Fat 

Top Of Stove : Preferred for small quantities 
of fat. 

Steam-Jacketed Kettle : Preferred for large 
quantities of fat. Render with lid off and 
steam valve wide open. 

Immersion Heat Unit Fryer: Suitable for 
rendering a small quantity of fat. Add fresh 
fat for rendering only when fat in fryer is hot 
from previous use. Do not heat fat in fryer to 
render a small quantity of additional fat, since 
each heating lowers the smoke point. 

How to Render Fat 

Put Ground Fat in Container: Use roasting 
pan, top of double-boiler or steam- jacketed 
kettle. Do not pack. Loose fat renders more 
quickly. Fat from beef, lamb, pork, and veal 
may be rendered separately, or together, in any 
proportions available. 

Render Slowly : Low temperatures help to 
provide a high quality rendered fat. Avoid hot 
spots on stove where fat is likely to scorch. 

Stir Frequently : Stirring prevents fat from 
sticking, shortens rendering time and assures 
a higher quality product. 

Render Until Done : When completely ren- 
dered, the cracklings have separated and are a 
mixture of grayish white and light brown color. 

Do Not Overcook : Overcooking impairs flavor 
and lowers the smoking point of rendered fat. 
Temperature of fat during rendering should 
not exceed 250° F. 



Ill* 



Handling Rendered Fat 

Pour Off Immediately After Rendering : The 
rendered fat may take on a roast meat flavor if 
allowed to remain with the cracklings too long 
after rendering. 

Strain Through Cloth : Place clean cheese- 
cloth in strainer over container. Dip and pour 
fat and cracklings into cloth, slowly. Press 
cracklings to remove fat. 

Cool At Room Temperature : Allow fat to 
cool at room temperature in clean container. 

Stir Occasionally: Stir rendered fat a few 
times while hardening to improve its texture. 



Recovering Fat Drippings 

Pour Off Excess Fat : Fat drippings not used 
for gravy should be saved. 

Strain Fat Through Cloth : Straining assures 
more satisfactory fat for cooking purposes. 

Cool At Room Temperature : Allow fat to 
cool slowly at room temperature in suitable con- 
tainer. If there is water in the fat it will settle to 
the bottom. The straight fat can then be removed. 

Blending and Storage 
of Fats 

Mixing Fats: Rendered fat from beef, lamb, 
pork, and veal and fat drippings may be kept 
separate or poured into the same container, if 
desired. When two or more kinds of fat are 
poured into the same container, they should be 
mixed thoroughly. 

Store in Covered Containers: Cover fat to 
keep out light and air; like heat they are 
enemies of fat. 

Store in Cool Place : As soon as the fat has 
cooled, place it in the refrigerator and hold it 
until ready to be used. Prevent accumulation of 
old stock. 



BASIC METHODS OF MEAT 
COOKERY 

There are two basic methods for cooking 
meat. 

1. By Dry Heat : The more tender cuts of 
meat which can be roasted, broiled or fried are 
cooked by this method. 

2. By Moist Heat : The less tender cuts, 
which contain more connective tissue and need 
longer cooking, in water or steam, to soften 
the connective tissue and make the meat more 
tender are cooked by this method. Braising and 
simmering are the two main ways of cooking 
meat by the moist heat method. 

How to Roast 

Season with salt and pepper: This may be 
done before, during, or at the end of the roast- 
ing period. 

Place roast on rack, if available, in the pan, 
fat side up: As fat melts it runs over and 
through the meat, so basting is unnecessary. 

Do not sear: Searing does not keep in the 
juices. Meat and gravy will be nicely browned 
without searing. 

Do not add water : At constant temperature, 
the drippings will not burn. If the heat cannot 
be kept constant, a small amount of water may 
be necessary. 

Do not cover: If covered, the meat will be 
surrounded by steam, making it a pot roast. 

Roast at constant temperature (325° F.): 
Roasting in a slow oven reduces shrinkage and 
increases flavor, juiciness and tenderness. 

Turn boneless roast: A boneless roast will 
cook more uniformily if turned once or twice 
during cooking. 

Roast until done : Time required for roasting 
depends on the kind of meat, oven temperature 
and degree of doneness desired. See Time- 
Table for roasting.

How to Broil 

Turn heat to highest point : Proper distance 
of meat from heat assures a moderate tempera- 
ture. 

Place steak in broiler: Place 1-inch steak 
2 inches from heat and 2-inch steak 3 inches 
from heat. 

Broil until top side is evenly browned'. The 
meat will be about half done at this point. 

Season browned side with salt and pepper: 
Salt is added after browning, to reduce the loss 
of juices. 

Turn, brown and season second side: Only 
one turning is necessary, as searing does not 
keep in juices. 

Broiling time: Size and thickness of steaks 
and chops determine the broiling time. See 
Time-Table for broiling. 

Serve hot: Broiled meat should be served on 
hot plates as soon after cooking as possible. 



How to Griddle-Broil 

Place meat on ungr eased griddle : Enough 
fat cooks out of meat to keep it from sticking. 

Brown and turn: This develops the flavor 
and insures more even cooking. 

Season with salt and pepper: Season each 
side after browning. 



Turn occasionally 
ing. 



This insures even cook- 



Cook at moderate temperature : A moderate 
temperature helps to retain the juice in the 
meat and prevents over-browning. 

Scrape away surplus fat as it collects : Meat 
should griddle-broil, not fry. 



Do not add water. Do not cover: 
braise in the presence of moisture. 



Meat will 



Cook to desired doneness : Time for griddle- 
broiling will be approximately V^ the time for 
broiling a similar cut of equal thickness. 

Serve hot : Broiled meat should be served on 
hot plates as soon after cooking as possible.

How to Fry 

1. Griddle-Frying 

Dredge meat in flour, if desired: Meat for 
frying should be sliced thin. 

Brown quickly on both sides, in small amount 
of hot fat: This differs from griddle-broiling 
in which no fat is added. 

Season with salt and pepper: Season each 
side after browning. 

Turn occasionally : This insures even cooking. 

Do not cover: If meat is covered it will 
braise. 

Cook at moderate temperature until done: 
Frying gives crisply browned exterior, and fine 
flavored, but less tender product than braising. 

2. Deep Fat Frying 

Keep temperature of fat under 380° F.: Fol- 
low recipe directions for deep fried foods. 

Proper Care of Frying Fat 

Proper care of frying fat is important to 
flavor, quality, wholesomeness and the econom- 
ical production of fried foods. 

Temperature Control: Fat should never be 
heated to a temperature above 400° F. It will 
burn or scorch and break down chemically. 
This impairs the flavor and quality and short- 
ens the life of the fat. 

Use a thermostat or a thermometer to control 
the temperature. Check at regular intervals to 
be sure the readings are accurate. 

Regulate the heat on gas heated equipment 
to prevent the flame from flaring up around 
the sides of the kettle above the surface of the 
fat. Hot fat splashed on a still hotter surface 
burns and scorches. 

In electrically heated equipment, carefully 
clean the heating elements to keep them free 
from burnt fat and food particles which may 
cause non-uniform heating. 

Adjust the burners frequently and periodi- 
cally. Poor adjustment produces unsatisfac- 
tory temperatures. 

Turnover: Fat is absorbed by the food in the 
frying process. Therefore, the original amount 
of fat in the kettle is reduced and fresh fat 
must be added to replace the absorbed fat. This 
replacement is called "turnover." A rapid 



"turnover" reduces the amount of fat to be 
discarded. 

Any frying fat will break down when it is 
held at frying temperatures. The more stable 
frying fats break down least. 

With a large amount of frying fat, in pro- 
portion to the amount of food being fried in 
the kettle, there is an excess of fat being held 
at frying temperatures. Also, fat absorbed in 
fried food is small in proportion to the total 
amount of fat in the kettle, and "turnover," 
therefore, is slow. These factors lead to fat 
breakdown. 

For best results use a frying kettle which is 
not too large for the amount of food being 
fried and use the smallest quantity of fat 
possible. 

Use the fat level ordinarily indicated on the 
equipment for best results. If a fat level is not 
indicated, about V2 kettle of fat allows ample 
room for frying without the fat bubbling or 
foaming over the top as food is added. 

Cleaning the Fat: Strain or filter off burnt 
food particles which collect in the fat after 
each frying period. An accumulation cau.ses 
excessive smoking and shortens the frying life 
of the fat. 

The simplest method for removing burnt 
particles is to strain the fat through several 
thicknesses of cheese cloth. 

When this method does not entirely clear 
the fat, it can be drawn off into a separate 
container, after heating it to a temperature 
below 212° F., and carefully sprinkling the 
surface with water. As the water settles to 
the bottom, it carries down very fine particles 
of burnt food which are suspended throughout 
the fat. The clear fat can then either be poured 
off from the water and remaining sediment, or 
the water and sediment can be drawn off from 
the bottom of the container by means of a 
spigot device. 

Cleaning Equipment: Clean frying kettles 
once each week. 

Scrub kettles with a wire brush and hot 
water and soap or washing powder. Be sure 
that no soap or washing powder remains. 
Rinse kettles thoroughly with clean water. 

When to Replace Frying Fat: Taste fried 
food daily in order to determine the point at 
which fat in the kettle should be discarded and 
replaced. If foods begin to have a noticeable 
flavor of used fat, the fat should be discarded 
for frying purposes.

How to Make a Stew 

Cut meat in small pieces: To avoid bone 
splinters, do not chop unboned meat with a 
cleaver. 

A boneless stew is more desirable than one 
with bones. 

Season with salt and pepper : Salt will pene- 
trate small pieces, so season at start of cooking. 

Brown meat on all sides in hot fat, if desired: 
A browned stew has more flavor than a light 
stew. 

Cover meat with hot or cold water: Boiling 
water does not seal in juices. Cover meat en- 
tirely with water so it will cook uniformly. 

Cover kettle and cook at simmering tempera- 
ture: Meat will have more flavor and more 
juice when simmered at 185 °F. to 200 °F. 

Cook until tender: Meat will be done when 
it is tender, about 2 to 21/2 hours. 



Add vegetables before meat is done : Vege- 
tables should be added just long enough before 
the meat is done for them to become tender. 
Follow recipe directions. 

How to Coot in Water (Simmering) 

Cover meat with water: Water may be hot 
or cold. It should entirely cover the meat to 
insure uniform cooking. 

Season with salt and pepper: Spices or herbs 
may be added for extra flavor. 

Cover kettle and cook meat until tender: 
Meat will be done when it is tender. 

Cook at simmering (not boiling) tempera- 
ture: Simmering retains juices, increases 
flavor, and leaves meat flrm for carving. 

Add vegetables, if desired: Vegetables should 
cook just long enough to be tender for best 
nutritive value, flavor and texture.

How to Braise 

Season with salt and pepper: Herbs, spices, 
and certain vegetables may be added for vari- 
ety in flavor during the cooking process. 

Brown meat on all sides in hot fat: Brown- 
ing develops aroma, flavor, and color. 

Add very little liquid: Meat and gravy will 
have better flavor and color when a small 
amount of liquid is added. 

Cover closely : This retains steam and helps 



to make the meat tender. 

Use oven, top of range or steam-jacketed 
kettle : The cooking utensil should remain 
covered. 

Cook at low temperature : A simmering 
temperature decreases shrinkage and increases 
juiciness and flavor. 

Cook until tender: Size, thickness and kind 
of meat influence the cooking time. When meat 
is tender it is done. Follow recipe directions.

119* 



Cooking Frozen Stewing and 
Boiling Beef 

Since stewing and boiling beef is cooked in 
the presence of moisture it makes no great 
difference whether or not this meat is defrosted 
before cooking. Simply cut it into pieces of 
a suitable size, cook at a simmering tempera- 
ture, and allow additional time for the cooking 
process. 



Roasting Frozen Beef 

Frozen, boneless beef can be roasted satis- 
factorily without being defrosted before it is 
put in the oven. A very low oven temperature 
(250° F.) must be maintained; otherwise the 
meat will become burned and charred on the 
outside before the inside is thawed and cooked. 
Frozen meat requires approximately twice as 
long to roast at 250° F. as fresh chilled or com- 
pletely defrosted meat at 325° F. 



CANNED MEATS 



A wide variety of canned meat products are 
provided for use when the supply of fresh meats 
is limite(^, unavailable, or impractical. Because 
they require less storage space than an equivalent 
amount of fresh meat, canned meats are desirable. 
In addition, with the exception of canned whole 
ham and canned sliced, dried beef, canned meats 
procured for Navy use are sterile and require no 
refrigeration. This releases valuable refrigerator 
space for provisions requiring it. 

Canned meats require .heating only before 
serving. They may be eaten cold. In order to 
reheat the meat, the best method is to heat the 



unopened can in boiling water. However, be- 
cause of the danger of handling hot cans and the 
possibility of the contents spattering when the 
can is opened, it is advisable to place the meat 
in roasting pans and reheat in an oven. 

Canned meats are served as they come pre- 
pared or can be used in all recipes which specify 
cooked meat as one of the ingredients. They can 
be used in place of fresh meat in some recipes. 
When canned meats are so used, allowance must 
be made for the fact that the meats are completely 
cooked to begin with, and the cooking period 
specified for fresh meat must be reduced.

Select fresh meat, preferably covered with 
fat layers, from brisket, plate, chuck or round. 

Cut into 5 to 6-pound pieces of uniform size. 

Cover bottom of thoroughly clean curing vat 
with a l^-inch layer of salt. 

Arrange alternate layers of meat and salt in 
vat, covering top layer of meat with a thick 
layer of salt. Pack meat as closely as possible. 

Heat water to boiling temperature. Add 
sugar and saltpeter, stirring until dissolved. 

Cool liquid until lukewarm. Pour over meat. 

Keep meat entirely under brine. Weight down 
with loose cover. 



Store in refrigerator at 34° F. to 38° F. 

Repack meat on the 4th and 8th days, revers- 
ing the individual pieces and the order of the 
cuts, so that the curing mixture will penetrate 
the meat evenly. Let meat stand 15 to 20 days. 

Note. — 1. A clean wooden tub or barrel, 
earthenware crock or galvanized curing vat may 
be used, 

2. Corned Beef is ready for use after 10 days, 
but 15 to 20 days is preferable for curing. 

3. Keep meat in brine until used. 

4. Use only fresh meat for corning. Meat 
which has begun to spoil is unwholesome and 
will probably sour during corning process.

possibility of discoloration. 

Test each piece of meat for doneness after 
31/2 to 4 hours of cooking. Remove each piece 
as soon as it is tender, to prevent overcooking. 

Submerge all pieces in cold water fat side 
down, at least 15 minutes, to bleach and solidify 
fat and prevent shrinkage.

KINDS OF SMOKED HAM 



.ommercia 



I H 



am 



The commercial, domestic, or regular-cure 
smoked ham has a low salt content and is suit- 
able for baking (roasting) without parboiling 
or soaking beforehand. 

Cutting Smoked Commercial Hams Before 
Cooking: The following method of preparing 
commercial hams in the butcher shop, before 
they are turned over to the cooks, is recom- 
mended for several reasons: 

The hams will require less space in the oven. 

They will be easier to carve. 

The shanks can be held back for seasoning 

purposes. 
The surplus fat can be rendered and used for 

frying and baking. 
It eliminates the possibility of cooking sour 

hams, because it provides a definite check 

on the interior of the ham around the leg 

bone. 

Directions for Cutting: Defrost ham com- 
pletely before preparation for cooking, if ham 
is frozen. 

Remove hock at stifle joint, leaving as much 
meat as possible on the cushion section. (Store 
hock in refrigerator until needed.) 

Trim off outside skin and remove surplus fat, 
exceeding one-half inch, covering outside of 
ham. 

Take out aitch bone. 

Loosen meat around knuckle ends of leg 
(round) bone. 

Note. — An alternate method is to remove the 
aitch bone after cooking, since it can be taken 
out easier then. This prevents checking the ham 
for sourness unless a ham trier is used. 

Carving Cooked Smoked Ham: It is assumed 
that the smoked ham was prepared before cook- 
ing as indicated in the paragraph "Cutting 
Smoked Commercial Hams Before Cooking." 
As a result the shank, aitch bone, skin and sur- 
plus fat from the outside of the ham have al- 
ready been removed. The ham contains only the 
leg bone. Allow ham to "set" for 30 minutes, 
then proceed as follows: 

Remove knuckle section by cutting through 
meat to leg bone on each side of ham. Re- 
move knee cap from this section. Lift out 
leg bone. 



Split cushion of ham into inside and outside 
sections. 

The preceding method of splitting the cooked 
ham provides 3 boneless pieces of uniform size. 
These may be carved across the grain either 
by hand or on the electric slicing machine. 



'verseas 



H 



am 



The overseas ham has a high salt content. It 
is usually shankless and, when it is to be used 
within a few weeks after leaving the packer, it 
may be wrapped in paper like the commercial 
ham. When it is to be shipped overseas, or is to 
be held for a long period of time without re- 
frigeration, it is put in a cloth bag and packed 
for export. 

When the overseas ham has been out of cure 
for only a short time, it may be cooked whole, 
if it is first parboiled for about 1 hour, or soaked 
overnight in cold water. 

When these have been out of cure for a month 
or longer, at temperatures which may exceed 
100° F., it is almost impossible to cook the ham 
whole and have a palatable product, even after 
soaking or parboiling before cooking. 

Since it is difficult to tell how long the ham 
has been out of cure, or at what temperatures 
it was stored, it is recommended that the over- 
seas ham be cut into slices not over 1 inch (pref- 
erably 14 inch) in thickness before cooking. 
The slices can be parboiled twice and then 
cooked in numerous ways. See recipes on pages 
171 and 173. 

Ham, Canned, Whole 

Canned whole hams are prepared from cured, 
smoked hams which have been completely skinned, 
boned, and closely trimmed. They are packed 
and cooked in hermetically sealed cans. These 
hams, including natural juices, weigh from 8 to 
14 pounds. 

Canned hams are perishable. Each can is 
marked "Perishable —Keep Under Refrigeration" 
and must be held under refrigeration of 50° F. 
or lower. 

Canned ham is cooked ready to eat as it is 
packed. It may be sliced for sandwiches, or, 
reheated, used as the meat item for a meal. Re- 
heating enhances the flavor of the ham. The 
natural juices in the can should be used as a base 
for soups, gravies, and for flavoring vegetables.

Poultry 



Poultry is purchased either frozen or fresh- 
killed and chilled, on the basis of dressed 
weight. It is considered dressed when it has 
been killed, bled and plucked. 

Dressed poultry is not ready to cook until it 
has been drawn, meaning that the entrails, head 
and feet have been removed, and then properly 
prepared for cooking. 

Frozen poultry should be stored at 0° F. to 
15° F. and never thawed until ready to be used. 

Fresh killed poultry should be stored at 
31° F. to 33° F. until ready to use. 

When purchasing fowl allow 12 ounces per 
portion dressed weight for turkey and 16 
ounces for chicken and duck. 

The weight of cooked edible meat of turkey 
approximates % of the dressed weight or 5 to 6 
ounces per pound. For chicken and duck, the 
cooked edible meat is equivalent to about 14 
of the dressed weight or 4 ounces per pound. 

Preparation for Cooking 

Singe and wash the bird thoroughly. 

Chop off head. 

Pull tendons if necessary and remove shanks 
at hock joints. 

Cut neck skin down center back to the 
shoulder. 

Free neck skin, gullet, windpipe and crop 
from neck. Pull gullet, windpipe and crop as 
far out as possible from the body. Be careful 
not to tear crop. Cut and remove. 

Remove neck from body at the shoulder. Cut 
through the neck muscle, then twist to separate 
the vertebrae. 

Drawing 

Make an incision with a sharp pointed knife 
around the vent. 

Cut abdomen through the internal body fat in 
a straight line from end of breast bone to incision 
made for vent. Avoid cutting intestinal tract. 

Insert finger. Loosen intestines all around the 
body cavity. Lift lungs from ribs. Remove 
gizzard and all the entrails intact. 

Cut out oil sac on back just above tail; run 
knife under the valve toward the tail. 

Wash carcass, inside and out, quickly but 
thoroughly. Do not soak. 

Separate giblets, gizzard, heart, and liver, from 
entrails. Carefully cut out bile sac from liver 
and discard it. 

Remove sac attached to heart and cut away 
blood vessels. Wash heart thoroughly. 



Cut into one side of gizzard just to inner sac. 
Pull walls away from inner sac. Discard sac. 
Wash gizzard. 

Note. — 1. Giblets should always be used 
because of their high nutritive value and good 
flavor. Cook them in a small amount of water 
until tender. Chop or grind them and add to 
gravy. 

2. Use the bones from uncooked or cooked 
poultry and the feet, scalded and skinned, for 
making stock. 

Trussing 

Cut skin at abdomen above the tail, parallel 
to the cut made for drawing. 

Put drumstick ends through the slits, under- 
neath the strip of skin, to hold leg to body dur- 
ing cooking. 

Draw neck skin over front opening onto 
back. 

Fold wings into place. 

Preparation of Broilers 

Singe and wash thoroughly. ' 

Lay bird on side. Cut off tail. Cut at an angle 
so that oil sac and vent are included with tail. 

Cut from neck down on both sides of back- 
bone. 

Remove backbone : grasp head and rip out 
back, neck and backbone in one piece. Chop off 
head. Reserve neck and backbone for soup. 

Open bird and remove entrails. Lift out 
lungs. 

Flatten bird, breaking or chopping wishbone. 

Snap joints to keep bird flattened during 
cooking. 

Separate giblets from entrails. Carefully cut 
out bile sac from the liver and discard it. 

Wash bird quickly but thoroughly. Do not 
soak. 

Disjointing Fryers and Fowls 

Cut bird into 12 pieces as follows : 

Remove wings at joint next to the body. 

Disjoint legs at the back. Cut each leg into 2 
portions at knee. 

Make an incision through the thin muscle tis- 
sue at rear of breast or keel bone. Pass knife 
forward and upward to the juncture of the last 
rib and the back. Repeat on opposite side. 

Bend back and break at that point. 

Remove intestines, giblets and lungs. 

Separate breast from ribs and cut into 3 
pieces.

Gravies and sauces are a very important 
part of the meal because they add the finishing 
flavor to the main dish or dessert. They also 
extend the main dish, provide contrasting 
texture and add variety to the menu. 



The gravy or sauce must be seasoned excep- 
tionally well and must also be a perfect accom- 
paniment to the meat, fish, vegetable or dessert 
with which it is to be served.

Saladi 



Salads have a recognized and important place 
on the menu and make a riutritious and refresh- 
ing contribution to the dinner or supper meal. 

Fruit and vegetable salads are the most 
popular and as such are one of the best means 
of introducing valuable vitamins, essential 
minerals and color into the meal. 

If a few simple rules for making salads are 
observed, these salads, selected for the Navy 
Mess, can be made quickly and easily and served 
frequently. 

Salad Greens 

Select salad greens carefully. 

Lettuce, endive, romaine, escarole, M^ater- 
cress, young spinach and cabbage offer an 
abundant choice for the greens which can be 
best used as a foundation or as one of the main 
ingredients in the salad itself. Parsley, water- 
cress and the inner tender leaves of curly en- 
dive can be used to advantage as a garnish. 

Sort, trim, wash and crisp the greens before 
making the salad. Wash them carefully to free 
them of sand and earth particles. Drain well. 

Cut lettuce and cabbage into strips or pieces 
or shred them, when they are to be used as 
one of the main ingredients in the salad. 

Place the prepared greens in pans ; cover 
them with wax paper, if available, then with a 
clean, damp cloth. Place them in a refrigerator 
to chill and crisp before using. They should be 
free of excess water and be one of the very last 
parts of the meal to be prepared. 

Fruits and Vegetables 

Select these with care and wash them thor- 
oughly. Trim and peel if necessary. Cut them 
into uniform sizes. Cook the vegetables which 
need cooking. Place the prepared material, 
covered, in a refrigerator to be chilled before 
combining with salad greens and dressing. 

Combining the Salad Ingredients 

Mix the salad carefully just before serving. 



Combine the prepared, chilled ingredients in 
small amounts at a time. Mix or toss them 
lightly together. Use a large fork to thoroughly 
distribute the ingredients and dressing. 

The Salad Dressing 

The salad dressing is as important as the 
salad itself. It brings a distinctive flavor to 
the salad. Each type dressing can take on a 
new flavor by the addition of various season- 
ings and herbs. 

As a rule, the dressing should be the last in- 
gredient to be added to the salad. This rule 
should be strictly followed for fruit salads and 
mixed greens. It should be added just about 
5 minutes before placing the salad on the serv- 
ing counter. An exception may be made for 
meat, fish, vegetable and potato salads. Adding 
the dressing to these salads 1 hour in advance 
of serving, and placing the salad mixture in a 
refrigerator to be chilled, will greatly improve 
the flavor of the salad. 

The salad dressing, and approximate amount 
necessary, is specified in each salad recipe. 



Serving the Salad 



Select as cool place as possible. If necessary 
to serve from the steam table, place the salad 
container away from the heat of the steam. 

Bring the salad from the refrigerator in 
small amounts at a time. In this way the salad 
will be cool, refreshing and the greens will re- 
main fresh and crisp. 

Place the salad container in a pan of ice, when 
possible. This will assure firmness in gelatin 
mixtures and prevent wilting of the salad 
greens. 

Sprigs of crisp parsley, radish roses, carrot 
strips or celery curls or other simple garnish, 
can readily be arranged on top or around the 
salad. This should be the finishing touch and 
will add greatly to the attractiveness of the 
salad.

Note. — 1. Avocados may be peeled and cut 
into strips or sliced, if desired. 



2. Avocados should not be cut until ready to 
serve as they discolor rapidly. Sprinkling cut 
pieces with lemon juice will help prevent dis- 
coloration. 

3. In order to avoid waste, the lettuce and 
avocados should be placed in separate con- 
tainers or trays on the serving counter, allow- 
ing each man to make his own selection.

Sandwiches 



Sandwiches serve two purposes in the menu. 
They provide satisfying nourishment in con- 
venient form in an emergency. They can be 
served without equipment and can be carried 
either in made-up form or as separate in- 
gredients. 

Sandwiches can be served, on occasion, as 
a main dish in the meal when served with hot 
vegetables, a salad and dessert. 



Pointers for Making 
Sandwiches 



Good 



Allow plenty of work space for making sand- 
wiches. Prepare all the materials in advance 
and have the necessary tools ready and at 
hand before beginning to make the sandwiches. 

Day-old soft bread is preferable. 

Place butter in a warm place to soften it. 
Do not melt. Whip softened butter to a creamy 
consistency so that it spreads easily and eco- 
nomically. When a soft filling is used, the but- 
ter can be mixed with it, thus saving time and 
one step in the operation of making the sand- 
wich. 

Butter one or both slices of bread, spread- 
ing from the corners and edges toward the cen- 



ter of the slice, so that the entire surface is 
covered. Butter prevents the sandwich filling 
from soaking into the bread. 

Make sandwich fillings just before using. 
Hold them in a refrigerator if they must stand 
any length of time. 

Wrap the sandwiches in wax paper. Place 
sandwiches in refrigerator until ready to use. 

The addition of chopped celery or crisp, 
shredded lettuce or cabbage, to appropriate 
soft fillings, makes the sandwich more palatable 
and increases the food value. 

Make Sandwich Filling Just 
Before Using 

Whenever possible, sandwich fillings should 
not be prepared until just before making the 
sandwiches. The fillings made with meat, egg, 
and fish are highly perishable and should not 
be allowed to remain in warm room temper- 
atures. 

When circumstances make it necessary to 
prepare the fillings and sandwiches 1 to 2 hours 
before they are to be used, place them in the 
refrigerator immediately after they have been 
made, and keep them there until just before 
using them.

Soups 



Soups serve as one of the best carriers for 
additional highly nutritive foods such as milk, 
meat, and vegetables. 

Soups range in variety from clear broth to the 
heavier types which include the cream and bean 
soups and chowders. If the meal tends to be 
of a hearty nature, it should be preceded by one 
of the lighter soups such as the clear broths and 
their variations. A light meal can be made more 
attractive and satisfying with the addition of a 
cream soup or chowder. 

The meat stock, which forms the basis for many 
soups, is an important item when foods in quantity 
are being prepared. It can be used as a base for 
sauces and gravies. It is advisable to keep fresh 
stock on hand at all times. 



Bouillon cubes, powdered bouillon, or bouillon 
type products can be used in place of, or as part 
of the meat stock. They are convenient to 
handle and can be used to advantage when bones 
are not available for making stock. 

Dehydrated soup mixtures, now available, are 
highly nutritious and tasty. Directions for pre- 
paring them should be carefully followed. 

The addition of fresh or canned vegetables to 
a soup prepared from a dehydrated soup base, 
and the use of meat stock for reconstituting these 
soups, enhance the flavor and contribute to the 
nutritional value of the soup. 

Liquid from canned vegetables, or water in which 
vegetables have been cooked, should be used in 
place of part of the water specified in the recipe.

Vegetables 



Vegetables enhance a meal in many ways. 
They insure variety and interest, add color 
and flavor and increase the nutritive value of 
the meal. It is important that they be included 
daily in the Navy menu. 

Their contribution to a meal, however, is 
greatly affected by the manner of handling and 
cooking. 

Vegetables are purchased by the Navy in 
the following forms : canned, dehydrated, quick- 
frozen and fresh. 

CANNED VEGETABLES 

Canned vegetables have been cooked in the 
container at the cannery and need only to be 
reheated to boiling temperature just before 
serving. This relatively short period of prep- 
aration should be given careful consideration 
when planning the meals in order to avoid over- 
cooking the vegetables. Overcooking not only 
reduces the food value but detracts from the 
appearance and flavor. 

Retain the liquid from canned vegetables for 
use in soups, sauces and gravies. 

DEHYDRATED VEGETABLES 

Most dehydrated vegetables need to be re- 
freshened or reconstituted by soaking in cold 
water before cooking. The water in which they 
have been soaked should be used for cooking 
in order to retain the soluble vitamins. 

Reconstituted vegetables should be cooked in 
as little water as possible until just tender, in 
the same manner as fresh vegetables. 

In the process of dehydration some of the 
delicate flavors and odors characteristic of the 
fresh vegetable may have been reduced or lost. 
Therefore, it may be necessary to use addi- 
tional seasonings. 

Individual recipes with full directions for 
reconstituting and cooking the dehydrated 
vegetables now issued for Navy use are included 
in this section. These directions should be care- 
fully followed. See page 19 for more information 
on dehydrated foods. 

QUICK-FROZEN VEGETABLES 

Quick-frozen vegetables have the appearance 
and flavor of fresh vegetables. These vege- 



tables are ready for cooking as they have been 
thoroughly cleaned and trimmed. 

Quick-frozen vegetables take less time to 
prepare than fresh vegetables. 

Follow carefully the directions for defrost- 
ing and cooking, given in a Table in this sec- 
tion (page 284) or as specified on the individual 
container, and see page 22 for additional informa- 
tion on quick-frozen foods. 

FRESH VEGETABLES 

Preparation for Cooking 

Select Vegetables Uniform in Size: This al- 
lows all the vegetables to be cooked to the same 
degree of doneness in the same length of time. 

Peel Vegetables Carefully in Order to Pre- 
vent Waste: Much of the nutritive value of the 
vegetable lies close to the peel. 

Wash Thoroughly : Use a vegetable brush to 
clean celery, carrots, beets and potatoes. 

Soak asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, brus- 
sels sprouts and French artichokes in salted, 
cold water (1 tablespoon per 1 quart) about 30 
to 60 minutes to eliminate worms and insects. 

Wash spinach, kale, beet tops and similar 
greens in cold water several times to remove 
dirt and sand particles. Lift the greens from 
the water rather than "run the water off" the 
greens. 

Keep in Cool Place until Time to Cook: Veg- 
etables should be kept in a cool storage room 
until ready to prepare for cooking. 

If vegetables are wilted they can be crisped 
and freshened by placing them in ice cold water 
or between layers of crushed ice. When fresh- 
ened they should be covered with a clean damp 
cloth and placed in a cool storage room until 
ready to use. 

Long Soaking and Warm Temperatures 
Cause Loss of Vitamins: Valuable vitamins 
and minerals are lost when vegetables are 
soaked too long or when allowed to remain in 
warm temperatures for several hours. There- 
fore, the length of time intervening between 
preparation and cooking should be short. 

Cooking: Cook a small amount at one time. 
Reduce cooking time to a minimum. Over- 



• 278 



cooked vegetables are not as attractive, palat- 
able or nutritious as those cooked for the 
proper length of time. 

Use as little water as possible. Follow recipe 
directions for each individual recipe. Have 
water salted and boiling when adding vege- 
tables. 

Cook Vegetable ivith the Peel on When Pos- 
sible: This is particularly desirable for po- 
tatoes. 

Serve the Vegetable as Soon as it is Done: 
Long standing on a steam table causes loss of 
flavor and vitamins. 

Retain Vegetable Cooking Water: Use cook- 
ing water in soups, sauces and gravies in place 
of all or part of water. 

Add melted butter or sauce to vegetables just 
before serving. 

Conserve Texture, Flavor and Appearance: 
Use vegetables which are in good condition. 

Cook a small amount at one time. 

Cook until just tender. 

Serve immediately after cooking. 



Taste before serving and add salt or extra 
seasoning if necessary. Avoid over-seasoning. 

Consult and follow directions given in time- 
tables and recipes if perfect results are to be 
obtained. 

The Fresh Vegetable Guide (page 280) indicates 
the amounts of the common fresh vegetables 
required for lUO portions. 

The percentage-waste figures for each vege- 
table are average based on vegetables in good 
condition. If vegetables have become wilted 
due to long transportation, poor handling and 
storage, the waste is greater. 

Weights of vegetables and types of pack will 
vary with the season of the year, the quality of 
the vegetables, and the section of the country 
from which they are shipped. All vegetables 
should always be purchased by the pound. 

Weights of portions are for cooked vege- 
tables. Weights of portions of baked vegetables 
served whole, such as potatoes, will depend 
upon the size and uniformity of the individual 
units.

Break solid block ol frozen vegetables, when not 
loose or individually frozen, into 4 to 5 pieces 
before removing from the carton, to hasten de- 
frosting in the cooking water. 

Remove from the carton. Drop into boiling 
water. Reheat to boiling temperature. 

Count cooking time only from the time the 
water returns to boiling temperature after the 
addition of vegetable. 

Stir occasionally and separate the vegetable 
while thawing in the water. 

Cook vegetable the required length of time 
as specified on Time-Table or until tender. 
Drain thoroughly. 

Season with butter, salt and pepper. Serve 
immediately. 



Note. — 1. For storage in excess of 2 weeks, 
store frozen vegetables at 10° F. or lower. When 
held for 2 days to 2 weeks, vegetables may be 
stored at 15° F. to 20° F. Store at 30° F. for 
period overnight or not to exceed 2 days. Frozen 
vegetables will keep as long as solidly frozen. If 
thawed, the vegetables must be used promptly. 
They cannot be refrozen. 

2. The actual cooking time will vary as it 
depends upon the type of cooking vessel, the 
product and the length of time the vegetable must 
be held after cooking. 

3. Avoid overcooking vegetables as this injures 
the appearance and flavor and reduces the food 
value. Long standing, after cooking, also affects 
the appearance, flavor, and food value. 

4. Save water from drained vegetable for soups, 
gravies, or sauces.

Information and Formulas 



The bakery formulas have been developed 
and tested by Navy personnel for use by Navy 
bakers. 

Bake shop equipment, Navy food issues, prin- 
ciples of nutrition and the latest developments 
in the bakery field have been taken into con- 



sideration in the selection of these formulas. 

The introductory material in the various 
chapters of the bakery section and the notes 
accompanying the formulas contain pertinent 
and valuable information. These should be 
carefully read before the formulas are used.

Functions of Flour in Baking: In addition 
to the food value of flour in baked goods, flour 
is important in forming structure to support 
other ingredients. 

Types of Flour: 

1. Hard Wheat Flour 

2. Soft Wheat Flour 

Hard wheat flour is characterized by its rela- 
tively high protein content. Soft wheat flour 
contains relatively lower amounts of protein. 
Both hard wheat and soft wheat flours are fur- 
ther classified into : 

Plain flour 
Enriched flour 

Plain flour is flour milled in the regular way. 
Enriched flour has been enriched by the addi- 
tion of: 

Thiamine (Vitamin Bi) 
Niacin or Niacin Amide 
Iron 

Riboflavin (Vitamin G) is added in some 
cases 

Hard Wheat Flour: Hard wheat flour is used 
chiefly for making bread, rolls, Danish pastry 
and coffee cakes. It may be used for all general 
baking purposes provided suitable formulas, 
properly balanced for hard wheat flour are used. 

Soft Wheat Flour: Soft wheat flour is used 
in production of cakes, cookies, pies and dough- 
nuts. It is unsuitable for bread, rolls and other 
baked goods of that type because of insufficient 
protein to form dough structure. 



Navy Issue Flour: Navy issue flour is en- 
riched hard wheat flour. Formulas in the bakery 
section have been developed and tested with 
Navy issue flour. 

Milk 

Functions of Milk in Baking: Milk is used in 
bakery products to 

Contribute to color of crust in such prod- 
ucts as bread, rolls, doughnuts and cakes 

Add moisture 
Add richness 
Add food value 

Types of Milk: Milk in any of the following 
forms may be used in baking: 

1. Liquid skim milk 

2. Liquid whole milk 

3. Powdered skim milk 

4. Powdered whole milk 

5. Evaporated milk 

6. Sour milk 

7. Buttermilk 

Milk in any of the forms listed above, except 
sour and buttermilk, can be used interchange- 
ably provided powdered or evaporated milk are 
properly reconstituted to give equivalents in 
milk solids content to milk specified in the for- 
mula. Directions for reconstituting powdered 
and evaporated milk are given on page (21). 

When sour milk or buttermilk is used, the 
acidity of the milk is balanced with soda. Nor- 
mally, '4 ounce (11 2 teaspoons) of soda per 
quart of sour milk or buttermilk will neutralize 



333* 



the acidity. Carbon dioxide gas is liberated in 
this process. Therefore, when sour milk or 
buttermilk are used with soda in a formula, 
their leavening effect must be taken into con- 
sideration, and the baking powder or other 
leavening ingredients in the formula reduced. 
One quart of buttermilk or sour milk with 
l^ ounce soda has the leavening power of ap- 
proximately 1/^ ounce baking powder. 

Handling Milk Products: Reconstituted 
evaporated or powdered milk is perishable and 
will spoil when held in warm temperatures, 
70° F. or above. Place milk in refrigerator until 
ready to use. 

Fresh liquid milk is perishable and should not 
stand in warm temperatures. It should be used 
immediately after removal from refrigerator. 



Shortening 



Eggs 



Functions of Eggs: Eggs are used in bakery 
products to 

Add color 

Add moisture 

Add richness 

Act as leavening agent (for sponge cake, 

angel food cake, and cream puffs) 
Add food value (protein and fat) 

Types of Eggs: Eggs fresh, frozen, or pow- 
dered can be used in the formulas in this book. 
The following types may be available : 

1. Fresh shell eggs 

2. Fresh egg yolks 

3. Fresh egg whites 

4. Frozen whole eggs 

5. Frozen egg yolks 

6. Frozen egg whites 

7. Powdered whole eggs 

8. Powdered egg yolks 

9. Powdered egg whites 

Powdered eggs must be reconstituted with 
cold water before using. For directions see page 
20. Each formula in this section requiring 
eggs gives exact instructions on using powdered 
eggs in place of fresh or frozen eggs. 

Handling Egg Products: Fresh eggs, recon- 
stituted powdered eggs, or frozen eggs are 
perishable when held at normal temperatures 
for any length of time. Eggs should be used 
within 3 or 4 hours after they have been held 
at temperatures of 70° F. to 80° F. 



Functions of Shortening : Shortening is used 
in bakery products to 

Produce tenderness 

Improve eating and keeping qualities 

Help produce better grain and texture 

Add richness 

Add food value 

In yeast-raised bakery products such as 
bread, rolls and sweet doughs, shortening has 
the added function of lubricating the gluten in 
the flour developed during mixing, making it 
soft and pliable. 

Shortening also helps emulsify and carry the 
moisture in yeast doughs, cake batters and 
icing. 

Types of Shortening : Shortenings are edible 
fats and oils of animal or vegetable origin. 

Oils: Shortenings which are fluid at ordinary 
temperatures are called oils. 

Fats: Those which are solid are called fats. 

Fats which are plastic at ordinary tempera- 
tures are used in the preparation of bakery 
products. Oils are occasionally used in bread 
but are most generally used in the manufacture 
of mayonnaise, salad dressings and to some ex- 
tent for frying purposes. 

Shortenings may be classified as follows : 

1. Lard 

2. Pure vegetable shortening 

8. Mixed animal and vegetable shortening 

Any type of shortening may be used in these 
formulas. Type No. 2 is standard Navy issue 
shortening. Formulas in the bakery section 
were developed and tested with Type No. 2. 

Sugar 

Functions of Sugar: Granulated, powdered 
and brown sugar are standard Navy issue in- 
gredients. Their functions are to 

Improve flavor 

Act as a shortener or tenderizer 

Contribute to the development of grain and 
texture 

Add richness 

Furnish food value in form of carbo- 
hydrates 

Improve keeping quality when added in 
form of sirup 



• 334 



Types of Sugar: Sugar is supplied in the 
form of 

1. Granulated sugar 

2. Confectioners' sugar 

3. Brown sugar 

4. Sugar sirups (malt, molasses, honey, 

corn sirup, invert sirup) 

Sugar Sirups: Sugar sirups may or may not 
be available. Their functions are the same as 
for other sugar. In addition, corn sirup and 
invert sirup improve the keeping quality of 
products in which they are used. For example, 
the addition of corn sirup or honey to cookie 
dough helps produce cookies which retain their 
moisture and keep soft and fresh for a long 
period. Keeping qualities are not important 
from the Navy point of view because most foods 
produced in the galley are consumed within a 
few hours after preparation. 

Sugar sirups are necessary in some specific 
types of products. For example, ginger bread 
contains only molasses as the sweetening and 
flavoring ingredient. Similarly, pecan pie is a 
special product made with only corn sirup, 
which gives the finished pie its characteristic 
eating quality. These, however, are isolated 
cases, and it is possible to make almost all 
bakery products without using sugar sirups. 

When available and deemed necessary to use 
them, sirups can be used in amounts up to about 
10% of sugar weight specified in the formula. 



Baking Powder 



Baking powder is a leavening agent produced 
by the mixture of an acid-reacting ingredient 
with an alkali-reacting one. These baking acids 
are tartrate, phosphates, and sodium aluminum 
sulphate, used alone, or in combination. 

By the action of moisture and heat they lib- 
erate carbon dioxide gas which causes doughs 
and batters to "rise." All types of baking pow- 
ders release not less than 12 per cent available 
carbon dioxide. 

Types of Baking Powder: Package labels in- 
dicate the composition of the baking powder. 
The commonly used types are : 

1. Tartrate base baking powder 

2. Phosphate base baking powder 

3. Sodium aluminum sulphate and phos- 

phate combination base baking pow- 
der 



4. Sodium acid pyrophosphate base bak- 
ing powder 

There is a difference in the rate of reactions 
of the different types of baking powder. 

Type No. 1. Tartrate base baking powder 
starts releasing carbon dioxide gas as soon as it 
comes in contact with moisture. Baked goods 
made with tartrate base baking powders should 
be baked almost immediately after making up. 

Type No. 2. Phosphate base baking powders 
are somewhat slower acting than Type No. 1 
but more rapid than Types No. 3 and No. 4. 

Type No. 3. Aluminum base baking powders 
are slower acting. They depend upon heat as 
well as upon moisture for releasing their full 
amount of carbon dioxide. 

Type No. 4. Sodium acid pyrophosphate is a 
type baking powder, particularly manufactured 
for use in large quantity baking. It is a slow 
acting baking powder and releases carbon di- 
oxide gas primarily in the presence of heat. 

Formulas in this section have been developed 
and tested with. Type No. 3 combination baking 
powder. 

Yeast 

Functions of Yeast'. Yeast is used in bakery 
products to 

Make a light porous dough 
Condition the dough batch 

Types of Yeast: The following types of yeast 
are used by the Navy : 

1. Compressed yeast 

2. Active dry- yeast 

3. Drj'^ yeast in cake form 

Compressed Yeast: Compressed yeast is sup- 
plied in 1-pound units approximately the size of 
1-pound print of butter and in i/o-ounce cakes. 

Compressed yeast will keep its full baking 
strength about 2 weeks when held at a tempera- 
ture of not higher than 40^ F. If compressed 
yeast is to be kept longer than 2 weeks, it must 
be fresh and in excellent condition and frozen 
at 20° F. or lower until used. Before using, 
slowly thaw yeast by holding in refrigerator at 
a temperature of about 40' F. 

The amount used in yeast-raised goods varies 
from about 1% (1 pound of yeast per 100 
pounds of flour) in lean bread doughs to as 
much as 11% (11 pounds per 100 pounds of 
flour) in rich coffee cake and Danish pastry 



335* 



doughs. Richer doughs require more yeast to 
properly leaven or raise the dough. Normally, 
bread requires about 2% (2 pounds per 100 
pounds of flour). 

Add compressed yeast to dough by breaking 
it into small pieces and mixing or dissolving it 
thoroughly in part of the water used in doughs. 
Incorporate the yeast solution along with other 
ingredients. Yeast solutions should not be 
brought in contact with relatively high strength 
salt solutions. 



Active Dry Yeast. Active dry yeast is usually 
supplied in small pellets or spheres. It may also 
be supplied in flakes or short rod-like pieces. 

Active dry yeast is yeast in which the moisture 
content has been reduced to not more than 8%. 
In the drying process some of the yeast cells are 
killed and the balance are made inactive. The 
net result is an inactive yeast, with approximately 
double the amount of live but inactive dry yeast 
cells, as are present in compressed yeast. 

Dried yeast functions in yeast-raised doughs 
exactly as compressed yeast. Half as much as 
the specified amount of compressed yeast is used. 
For example, a bread formula calling for 2 pounds 
of compressed yeast requires 1 pound of active 
dry yeast. 



How to "Reactivate": It is necessary to "re- 
activate" the yeast before adding it to the dough 
mix. This is accomplished as follows : 

Dissolve required quantity of yeast in luke- 
warm water (70° F. to 80° F.). 

Add small amount of sugar to furnish food 
for yeast cells. 

Allow mixture to stand at temperatures of 
70° F. to 75° F. for 45 to 60 minutes. This step 
is usually termed "pre-treatment" of yeast. 

Quantities of sugar and water used in pre- 
treatment are subtracted from the dough for- 
mula. Usual quantities for "pre-treatment" are 
as follows: 

Yeast — 5 parts, by weight 
Sugar — 1 part, by weight 
Water — 35 parts, by weight 

Example: Bread formula calls for 2 pounds 
compressed yeast. 

Active dry yeast — 1 pound 

Sugar — 3 ounces 

Water, warm — 7 pounds (31/2 quarts) 



Dissolve ingredients in warm water and al- 
low to remain in warm place, 70° F. to 75° F,, 
for 45 to 60 minutes. Occasional stirring aids 
reactivation. Add to the dough mix in the same 
manner as compressed yeast. Deduct the 3 
ounces sugar and 7 pounds (31/4 quarts) water 
from quantities specified in formula. 

Storage: Long periods of storage, or more 
particularly, high temperature storage, kills the 
inactive yeast cells in dried yeast as the following 
table shows. 

Storage Temperature: Results 

98° F. for6 

weeks Marked loss in leavening 

power. 

86° F. for 10 

weeks Marked loss in leavening 

power. 

70° F. for 6 

months Slight, but not materiafly 

significant, loss in leav- 
ening power. 

40° F. to 50° F. 
(refrigerator) 

for 1 year No appreciable loss in 

leavening power. 

Active dry yeast can be frozen without ill 
effect, providing it is thawed slowly at a tempera- 
ture of 40° F. to 50° F. 

Use the following procedure to handle dried 
yeast which has been injured by adverse storage 
conditions: 

Increase "pre-treatment" time from 1 hour to 
2 hours, or longer. This longer period allows 
the dormant cells to grow and "bud" or to create 
new active cells. 

"Fermenting time" and/or "proof time" of 
the finished dough may be lengthened so that 
required rise is obtained. 

Adjustments in the procedure can best be 
determined by actual practice and depend on the 
condition of the yeast. 

It is not desirable to increase the quantity of 
dried yeast in order to compensate for loss in 
leavening power. Dried yeast contains, in rela- 
tively small quantities, enzymes which affect 
the protein in the flour. If the quantities of 
these enzymes are too high, a sticky dough with 
lessened structure-building properties is ob- 



• 336 



tained. When yeast shows decreased leavening 
power, do not increase the yeast quantities. 

To extend the quantities of yeast on hand, the 
weight of yeast used can be decreased some- 
what, and the pre-treating period lengthened. 
This permits new yeast cells to grow, which in- 
creases the fermenting power of the yeast. 

Dry Yeast Mixed with Cereals: Dry yeast 
(cake form) with cereals is a mixture of yeast 
and cereals pressed into cakes weighing about 
2 ounces each. Half as much as the specified 
amount of compressed yeast is used. Quantities 
and dough mixing are similar. However, from 
12 to 20 hours are required to produce good 
bread. Fermentation times are considerably 
lengthened. 

Keeping Qualities: Dry yeast with cereals 
has very good keeping qualities. It maintains 
satisfactory baking qualities for approximately 

1 year when held at temperatures between 
65° F. and 70° F. 

Activating: The "activation" or "pre-treat- 
ment" period described for granular dried yeast 
may also be applied to dry cake yeast to speed 
up yeast activity. A pre-treatment of from 1 to 

2 hours in dilute sugar solution is helpful. 



EMERGENCY SPONGE METHOD 

Use when the supply of granular dehydrated 
yeast (active dry yeast) is limited or has lost 
its strength due to improper storage. 

This method of bread making can be used 
for any size dough batch on a continuous pro- 
duction basis.

Pan Grease 

Pan grease, while not actually an ingredient, 
is a prerequisite for good baking and is there- 
fore included in this section. 

The proper use of pan grease will eliminate 
waste through a reduction in cripples and 



breakage. Grease suitable for various kinds of 
bakery products are listed in the following 
tables. 

Over-greased pans may produce poor volume 
in cakes, cookies with excessive spread and 
bread with greasy crust. Use only enough pan 
grease to cover suface of baking pan.

The property of dough to 
ferment at a rate slow 
enough to prevent over-fer- 
mentation while dough is be- 
ing made up into units on the 
bench. 

Combining or thorough mix- 
ing of ingredients in making 
a food product. 

A mechanical press which 
takes a large piece of dough 
and cuts it into 36 pieces 
suitable for making up into 
buns, rolls or similar prod- 
ucts. Usually a 36-ounce 
piece of dough is used, which 
yields 36 pieces each weigh- 
ing 1 ounce. 

Mixing until smooth, sugar, 
shortening and other ingre- 
dients to incorporate air so 
that resultant mixture is 
thoroughly blended and in- 
creases appreciably in vol- 
ume. 

A misshapen, burnt or other- 
wise undesirable product. 

Formation of dough crust on 
surface of doughs due to 
evaporation of water from 
the surface. 

Punching a number of im- 
pressions in a dough with a 
smooth round stick about the 
size of a pencil or with fin- 
gers. Docking is done so that 
doughs expand uniformly 
during baking. 

The process of blending to- 
gether fat and water or 
water solutions of ingredi- 
ents to produce a stable mix- 
ture which will not separate 
on standing. 



Fat Absorption: Fat which is absorbed in 

food products as they are 
fried in deep fat. 



Fermentation, 
Primary: 



Floured Bench: 



Function: 



Fondant: 



Time given to dough be- 
tween mixing and punching, 
during which yeast grows, 
generating carbon dioxide 
gas which causes dough to 
expand. 

Flaky Pie Crust: Pie crust made by leaving 

lumps of shortening in the 
dough which, as the dough is 
rolled out, form layers of fat 
to give a flaky effect to fin- 
ished crust. 

Sprinkling flour on bench 
surface to prevent dough 
from sticking. 

Reason for the use of ingre- 
dients or procedures in bak- 
ing. 

A mixture of sugar, water 
and corn sirup which is 
cooked to 240° F., grained or 
crystallized and beaten 
smooth. Fondant is used for 
icings and in making candy. 

The essential constituent of 
flour, which is primarily' re- 
sponsible for producing elas- 
ticity in dough. The elas- 
ticity enables the dough to 
retain the fermentation 
gases. 

After boiling a sugar solu- 
tion to the desired tempera- 
ture the solution will crystal- 
lize upon cooling. If cooling 
is slow, large crystals will 
form. Rapid cooling pro- 
duces small crystals as will 
rapid mixing during cooling. 
Small fine crystals are de- 
sired in making fondant and 
this is accomplished by cool- 
ing and mixing. This process 
is termed "graining". 



Gluten: 



Graining: 



339* 



Leavening: The raising or lightening of 

a batter or dough by the use 
of baking powder (chemical 
ingredients) or yeast. 

Make-Up: The process of forming a 

dough or batter into specified 
units. For example, forming 
a yeast dough into cinnamon 
rolls, or cutting cookies from 
a cookie dough. 

Mealy Pie Crust: Pie crust made by thor- 
oughly blending together 
flour and shortening so that 
a short tender crust is ob- 
tained. 



Molding .

Plasticity: 
Proof Time. 



Punching 
Doughs: 



Quick Breads: 



Rounding Up. 



Forming bread or sweet 
yeast doughs into loaves or 
units of desired size and 
shape. 

Yeast dough which has be- 
come over-fermented due to 
long fermentation. This pro- 
duces finished yeast goods 
dark in color, sour in flavor, 
low in volume, coarse in 
grain and rough in texture. 

The consistency or "feel" of 
a shortening. 

The secondary fermentation 
period given to dough be- 
tween make-up and baking, 
for the purpose of permit- 
ting further yeast growth. 
This in turn causes the 
dough to rise, giving a light 
finished product. 

The process of knocking out 
of yeast dough the gas 
formed during the primary 
fermentation period. 

Biscuits, muffins, and bread- 
like products in which bak- 
ing powder is used for 
leavening. 

Forming bread or sweet 
yeast doughs into round balls 
of the desired size for later

In boiling a sugar solution, 
crystals form on the sides of 
the container. A brush 
dipped in water can be used 
to wash these crystals back 
into the boiling sugar solu- 
tion. This helps to produce a 
uniform sirup. 

Water required to produce a 
bread dough of desired con- 
sistency. Flours vary in abil- 
ity to absorb water. This 
depends on age of flour, 
moisture content, wheat 
from which it is milled, stor- 
age conditions and milling 
process. Navy issue flour 
normally absorbs water from 
60 to 65 per cent of its 
weight.

Production Pointers 

Mixing 

Three purposes of dough mixing are : 

To bring about an intimate and uniform mix- 
ture of the ingredients to form a smooth dough. 

To make possible the complete wetting of the 
flour and to develop the dough mechanically so 
that it becomes pliable and extensible. 

To distribute the yeast cells throughout the 
dough. 

Two standard methods of dough mixing are: 

1. The Straight-Dough Method: In this 
method all the ingredients are mixed in one 
operation. The ordinary sequence is as follows : 

Dissolve yeast in part of the water at 78° F. 
to 80° F. 

Pour remaining water into mixer. Add salt, 
sugar, and milk. 

Dissolve these ingredients by a few turns of 
the mixer arms. 

Stir in yeast solution, OR 

Add flour and yeast solution. 

Mix dough about 1 minute. Add shortening 
and mix to completion. 

2. The Sponge-Dough Method: This is a 
two-stage mixing process. Ordinary sequence is 
as follows: 

Mix together 55% to 70% of the flour, 55% 
to 65% of the water and all of the yeast to 
form the "spofige." 

After the sponge has risen for the desired 
length of time, put it back into the mixer and 
mix together with remaining flour, water, malt, 
sugar, salt, milk and shortening. 

Formulas in the bakery section of the Navy 
Cook Book are based on the straight-dough 
method. 

Fervientation 

Place mixed dough in a trough which has 
been lightly greased. The sides of the dough 
should be pulled over so that the top is smooth. 
If standard troughs are used, straight doughs 
require 2 feet of trough length for each 100 
pounds of flour used. Sponge doughs require 
2 feet for each 50 pounds of flour used. 

Dough temperatures: It is important that 
doughs should be set from 77^ F. to 80° F. 
whenever possible. Low temperatures slow up 
yeast action. High temperatures make the 



dough difficult to handle. They may also cause 
the development of undesirable bacteria, such 
as rope, wild yeasts, and excessive acidity which 
tends to weaken the gluten, resulting in a 
coarse-grained loaf of poor flavor. Doughs set 
from 77° F. to 80° F. will produce bread having 
better flavor and keeping quality and whiter 
crumb color than bread made from warmer 
doughs. 

Punching or turning and folding: A straight 
dough is allowed to rise until light, until it will 
just recede when the fingers are pushed down 
about 4 inches and quickly withdrawn. The 
dough is then "punched," or turned and folded. 

A straight dough made with 2 per cent yeast 
will be ready for the "punch" in about 2 to 21/? 
hours. Dough is allowed to loosen up for about 
20 minutes before making up. 

The final maturity and, consequently, the 
quality of the bread, depends largely on the time 
the dough is punched. It is important that the 
time be gauged carefully. 

Dividing and scaling: Divide dough either 
by hand on the bench, or by machine. 

In hand dividing, each piece of dough should 
be scaled. In machine operation, only an occa- 
sional scaling is necessary as the dough pieces 
come from the divider. Under normal condi- 
tions, in making white pan bread a pound loaf 
will be produced from 18 to I8Y2. ounces of 
dough. 

Rounding: Each piece is rounded or balled 
up so as to seal the cuts made in dividing. 

Intermediate proof: The rounded pieces of 
dough are allowed to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. 
They should be covered and kept free from 
drafts so as to prevent drying out and crusting. 

Molding: After the intermediate proof, 
mold the pieces into loaves, using as little dust- 
ing flour as possible. 

Panning: Pans should be lightly greased. 
Only enough grease should be used to prevent 
loaves from sticking to the pan. Excess grease 
is not only wasteful but it causes the loaf to fry 
in the oven instead of baking properly. 

Place each piece of dough so that the molding 
seam faces the bottom of the pan. The dough 
loaves should be long enough to reach the ends 
of the pan. 

341* 



Bread pans should always be kept clean. Wipe 
clean with a dry cloth after each baking. At 
frequent intervals, wash the pans in a dilute 
solution of washing soda or tri-sodium phos- 
phate using 2 ounces per gallon of water. 

Pan vroofing: Time, teynperature and hu- 
midity: Since the molding process compresses 
each piece of dough, thereby expelling a large 
amount of the gas, it is necessary for the dough 
loaves to rise to the proper degree of lightness 
before baking. This is known as "proofing." 

It is important to control proofing time, 
temperature and humidity. An underproofed 
dough will produce bread of small volume which 
will be soggy and heavy. Overproofing weakens 
the structure of the dough, and if excessive, 
may cause the loaf to drop. The resulting bread 
will be irregular in shape, small in volume and 
coarse in grain and texture. 

The proofing cabinet or room is usually well 
insulated so as to maintain a uniform tempera- 
ture of 95°F. to 98"F. and a relative humidity 
of 80% to 85%. At this temperature, yeast 
action is vigorous and the relatively high hu- 
midity prevents the dough loaves from crusting 
over. The loaves are allow^ed to proof from 30 
to 60 minutes until they are double in size. 

If pan racks are available, the upper shelves 
of the cabinet should be loaded first. If, how- 
ever, the temperature and humidity of the proof 
box are not uniform and the upper part of the 
box is warmer than the bottom, the racks should 
be loaded from bottom to top. 

Baking 

Temper'ature and time: Oven temperatures 
range between 375°F. to 450°F., depending on 
type and size of loaf. Flash heat, a temporary 
excessive oven temperature at the start of the 
baking process, is to be avoided for it will cause 
a crust to form on the dough loaves before the 
inside is properly baked. 

Spacing pans in oven: To insure uniform 
baking, the pans must be properly spaced. The 
exact space which will permit thorough baking 
of the center loaves in a set of pans depends on 



the type and size of pan as well as on the type 
of oven. 1-pound pans should be spaced about 
% inch apart at the top. 

Loading and unloading: Extreme care 
should be taken to avoid jarring the pans as 
they are removed from the proof box and loaded 
into the oven. In loading an oven, it is advisable 
to load one half first, working from the rear to 
the front, then the other half. In unloading, the 
half which was loaded first should be emptied 
first. 

Loss of weight: Loss in weight during bak- 
ing is due mainly to evaporation of moisture 
from the dough loaves and varies with the type 
of dough, size of loaf and general oven condi- 
tions. It must be determined by experience in 
order to set the necessary scaling weight. 

Cooling: Cool bread gradually to avoid 
cracking of the crust. 

Controlling Rope 

Rope is a bread infection which may appear 
in 6 to 24 hours after baking. Rope can be 
detected in the bread by an odor resembling ripe 
cantaloupe. As rope develops yellow or brown 
spots, having soft sticky centers, form in the 
crumb. The spots increase in size until in 
about 48 hours the crumb of the loaf is changed 
into a strong smelling, brownish, soft, sticky 
mass which can be pulled into strings or rope. 



Cause: Rope is caused by bacteria which are 
found on the surfaces of grains, potatoes and 
other vegetables and in the soil. Moist, warm 
conditions favor the development of rope. 

Remedy: Keep bake shop in a clean, sani- 
tary condition. 

Sterilize equipment with live steam or boiling 
vinegar. 

Keep doughs cool, not over 80°F. 

Add vinegar to each dough in the proportion 
of 1 quart of vinegar to each 100 pounds of 
flour. This is an absolute preventative. 

Cool bread as rapidly as possible after bak- 
ing.

Sweet Yeast Dough 



Production Pointers 

Basic Types: 

1. Ordinary sweet yeast dough. 

2. "Rolled In" or Danish dough. 

The basic difference between the two types is 
in the handling after mixing. 

Ordinary sweet yeast dough is mixed, given 
fermentation time, made up, proofed, baked 
and finished. 

Danish dough is mixed, shortening or butter 
is rolled in, and then handled the same as ordi- 
nary sweet yeast dough. 

The basic sweet yeast dough formula given 
on page 353 is suitable for mixing up into either 



regular sweet yeast goods or into Danish pastry. 
Danish pastry is made by rolling in from 2 
ounces to 5 ounces shortening or butter to 1 
pound of dough. The higher the amount of 
"rolled in" fat used, the richer the finished 
Danish pastry. 

Mixing: The purposes of the mixing opera- 
tion are: 

To blend thoroughly all ingredients 
To develop sufficient structure-forming 
gluten 

These two objectives can be accomplished by 
adding ingredients to the mixing bowl either 
singly or in groups. 

An easier way is to mix sweet doughs by the 



351* 



simplified mixing method outlined on page 353. 
In this method all the ingredients are added to 
the mixing bowl and mixed until a smooth 
uniform dough is obtained. 

This saves time and aids in more uniform 
production of sweet yeast goods. Sweet doughs 
can be mixed by this method in as short a time 
as 3 minutes. 

Fermentation: Sweet doughs, because of 
their richness, have wider fermentation toler- 
ance than bread doughs. The dough tempera- 
tures do not have to be carefully controlled. 
Doughs may be taken from the mixer at tem- 
peratures ranging from 78° F. to 85° F. Pri- 
mary fermentation from II/2 to 2 hours is 
necessary. Higher dough temperatures require 
a shorter time. 



Sweet doughs have good bench tolerance. 
They do not become overfermented if made up 
within 1 hour after primary fermentation. 
Secondary fermentation, or pan proofing, re- 
quires about 1 hour. 

Sweet doughs produce best finished products 
when handled on the "young" side. "Old" (over- 
fermented) doughs produce baked goods poor in 
flavor and appearance. 

Refrigeration: Sweet yeast doughs lend 
themselves readily to refrigeration. If refriger- 
ation facilities are available, it is possible to 
make up the Basic Sweet Dough (page 353) 
many hours before baking time. 

The following table shows 2 general methods 
of handling refrigerated doughs. 



HANDLING REFRIGERATED SWEET YEAST DOUGHS 
Method I Method II 

Mix the dough. Mix the dough. 



Bring dough from mixer at normal tempera- 
ture, 78° F. to 85° F. 

Give dough from V^ to % normal fermenta- 
tion time. 

Punch and flatten 8 to 10-pound pieces of 
dough on bun pans. Cover with greased 
paper. Refrigerate at 32° F. to 40° F. 

Bring each 8 to 10-pound piece to room 
temperature. 

Make up into various units. 



Proof in normal way. 
Bake in normal way. 



Bring dough from mixer at normal tempera- 
ture, 78° F. to 85° F. 

Give dough from i/^ to % normal fermenta- 
tion time. 

Make up into various units. Place individual 
pieces on bun pans. Cover with greased 
paper. 

Refrigerate at 32° F. to 40° F. 



Bring individual pieces on each pan to room 
temperature. 

Proof in normal way. 

Bake in normal way. 



Avoid "Old" Doughs When Handling Refrig- 
erated Sweet Yeast Doughs: Maintain refrig- 
erator temperature under 40° F.- 

Open refrigerator no more than necessary. 

Scale dough pieces to weigh less than 10 



pounds. Larger pieces ferment too much before 
the cold temperature of the refrigerator pene- 
trates to the center of the dough to prevent 
yeast activity. 

Doughs cannot be successfully refrigerated 
for more than 72 hours.

Quick Breads and Griddle Products 



Production Pointers 

The term "quick breads" covers all types of 
breads and griddle products in which baking 
powder is used as the leavening ingredient. 

Mixing: Mix batters just enough to properly 
combine ingredients for making tender, fluffy 
textured, finished products. 

The simplified mixing procedure outlined for 
the formulas in this chapter is easy to follow 
and aids in producing uniform breads and 
griddle products. 

Avoid over-mixing of these batters as they 



are all soft due to high liquid content. Over- 
mixing develops the elasticity of the flour 
gluten; this has a toughening effect. 

Make-up and Scaling: Quick breads are most 
conveniently made up by spreading the batter 
on a thoroughly greased bun pan. Use from 
4 to 5 pounds of batter per pan to give finished 
breads of proper volume for serving. 

Baking: Bake small units, such as muffins 
and biscuits at temperatures ranging from 
400° F. to 425° F. Bake larger units, such as 
quick breads scaled in bun pans, at approxi- 
mately 375° F.

Production Pointers 

Cakes Requiring Chemical Leavening In- 
gredients to Prodtice Proper Lightness: The 
function of the mixing process is to properly 
blend ingredients and to build up a cellular 
structure which will expand during baking and 
produce cakes with desired volume, grain and 
texture. 

Much work and experimentation has been 
done to develop cake mixing methods which 
accomplish this with a minimum of time and 
effort. The result is the "simplified cake mixing 
method" specified in the following formulas for 
layer cakes. 

1. Simplified Cake Mixing Method: This 
method essentially consists of blending all dry 
ingredients with eggs and part of milk to pro- 
duce a smooth batter and then gradually incor- 
porating remaining milk. First speed of a 
3-speed machine, or second-speed of a 4-speed 
mixing machine are usually used in putting 
batters together. 

Mixing time required, using this simplified 
method, is about 7 minutes. 

The temperature of all ingredients should be 
about 75° F. 

Cold shortening may give a lumpy batter 
because it will not blend uniformly with other 
ingredients. 

Cold milk or eggs produce a stiff batter which 
results in cakes that have poor volume or split 
during baking. 

Warm batters produce cakes with poor vol- 
ume and a grain in which tunnels and large 
holes are formed during baking. 

For best results, cake batters should be mixed 
at temperatures between 60° F. and 85° F. A 
temperature of 75° F. gives best results. 

Cool The Ingredients 

In warm locations where outside tempera- 
tures may be 100° F, or more, it is possible when 
refrigeration is available, to cool ingredients to 
desired temperature. 

Milk and eggs can be refrigerated so that 
when added to other ingredients, the resultant 
batter is at proper temperature. Dried milk, 
reconstituted double strength and diluted with 
equal parts of cracked ice, or evaporated milk 
diluted with cracked ice, can be added to the 



cake ingredients to produce batters of proper 
temperature. As ice melts, the warm ingredients 
cool down to desired mixing temperature. 

Cakes Requiring Incorporation of Air for 
Proper Lightness : Pound cakes, in general, 
are mixed in the same way as layer cakes 
except that higher mixing speeds are used. 
This is necessary in order to incorporate more 
air into the batter. 

Pound cakes may contain little or no baking 
powder and their lightness depends upon the 
amount of air incorporated during mixing. 
Second speed on a 3-speed machine, or third 
speed on a 4-speed mixing machine are used 
in making pound cake. 

Pound cake batters which are too cold or too 
warm will not incorporate air in the desired 
amounts. It is practically impossible to pro- 
duce good pound cake if batter temperature is 
above 85° F. or less than 60° F. 

Cakes Dependent upon the Development of 
Egg Structure for Proper Volume: 

Sponge Cakes 

Sponge cakes may contain little or no baking 
powder and depend upon the development of 
egg structure for their lightness. Eggs and 
sugar can be whipped to their maximum light- 
ness at a temperature of approximately 120° F. 
It is difficult to make good sponge cake with cold 
ingredients. 

The foam structure which has been built up 
by whipping or beating sugar and eggs must be 
carefully incorporated with the remaining 
ingredients. Two methods are usually em- 
ployed : 

1. Build the egg structure first and add 
other ingredients; OR 

2. Blend other ingredients and fold in the 
sugar and egg structure. 

Either method gives satisfactory results. 

2. Hand Mixing: Cake batters up to 25 
pounds in weight can be put together by blend- 
ing the ingredients by hand. The same general 
method outlined in the formulas should be fol- 
lowed. Blend ingredients sufficiently to produce 
a smooth, light batter. 

Batters mixed by hand require a longer mix- 
ing time than do batters mixed by machine.

2. Bananas, because they discolor fairly 
rapidly, should not be peeled until just before 
placing in mixer. Fully ripe bananas, flecked 
with brown, do not discolor as quickly as those 
with all yellow peel or deep green tip. Fully ripe 
bananas also have a richer, sweeter flavor.

Pound Cake Variations 

Raisin Pound Cake 

Make-up: Mix together 3 pounds (2I/4. 
quarts) raisins with 8 ounces (1 pint) flour and 
blend into either the Yellow Pound Cake 
(page 387) or the White Pound Cake batters. 

Scale about 20% heavier than ordinary Pound 
Cake to give cakes of comparable volume. 

Baking: Bake at the same temperature as 
regular Pound Cake. 

Nut Pound Cake 

Make-up: Mix 2 pounds (ll^ quarts) of 
chopped or shaved nuts into either the Yellow 
Pound Cake (page 387) or the White Pound 
Cake batters. 

Scale about 10% heavier than ordinary 
Pound Cake to give cakes of comparable volume. 



Baking: Bake at the same temperature as 
regular Pound Cake. 

Light Fruit Cake 

Make-up: Blend together 20 to 30 pounds of 
mixed fruits, nuts, and raisins. Incorporate in 
Yellow Pound Cake (page 387) batter. 

Scale 50% heavier than Yellow Pound Cake 
to give cakes of comparable volume. 

Baking: Bake at temperature about 30° F. 
lower than temperature for comparable Pound 
Cake units. Increase baking time about 75%. 

Dark Fruit Cake 

Make-up: Blend together 1 pound dark mo- 
lasses and 20 to 30 pounds of mixed fruits, nuts 
and raisins. Incorporate in Yellow Pound Cake 
(page 387) batter. 

Scale 50% heavier than Yellow^ Pound Cake 
to give cakes of comparable volume. 

Baking: Bake at temperature about 30= F. 
lower than temperature for comparable Pound 
Cake units. Increase baking time about 75%. 

Note. — 12 ounces (I'/o pints) cocoa or 12 
ounces melted chocolate may be used in place 
of molasses to produce a Dark Fruil Cake. 



• 388 



Use White Pound Cake (page 388) or Light 
Fruit Cake (page 388) for making Wedding 
Cakes. Either cake is traditional for Wedding 
Cakes. 

Make-up: Build up different size layer cakes 
into tiers to form a finished cake of the desired 
size and symmetry. 



WEDDING CAKES 

For a cake of good symmetry, use 2 (14-inch) 
layers for the first tier; 2 (10-inch) layers for 
the second tier; and 2 (6-inch) layers for the 
top or third tier. 



Use scaling weights in Table III for making 
cakes suitable for building into Wedding Cakes.

Types of Icings 



1. Fudge type icing 

2. Cream icing 

3. Fondant cream icing 

4. Marshmallow icing 

Proper Use of Icings 

Ice cakes carefully to give best appearance 
and flavor. 

Have cakes cooled to room temperature be- 
fore icing. 

Use a liberal quantity of icing. 

Use icings at proper temperature. 



cings 

storage: Store all icings, except marsh- 
mallow, in refrigerator A^hen not in use. Cover 
the icing container with wax paper to prevent 
crusting. Icings stored under 60° F. will keep 
fully a week. 

Marshmallow Icing: Make up marshmallow 
icing as needed because this icing toughens on 
standing. Leftover marshmallow may be added 
to a new batch of icing as it is being mixed. 

Conservation of Sugar in Icings: A knowl- 
edge of the sugar content of icings, and infor- 
mation on the amount of icing required per 
cake, proves helpful in using sugar supplies 
judiciously. 

Use the icing which will ice more cakes for 
each pound of sugar used.

Cake Doughnuts 



Production Pointers 



Dough Handling: Mix doughnut doughs ac- 
cording to dough temperature. Cold doughs 
require more mixing than warm doughs. A 
dough temperature of about 75° F. is normal 
for most cake doughnut mixes. 

Allow dough mixed for machine doughnuts 
to stand 15 to 20 minutes before it is put 
through the mechanical dropper. This practice 
permits dough to "open up" somewhat, and 
helps to prevent formation of objectionable 
tight center cores. 

Allow doughnuts, made by rolling and cut- 
ting out dough, to rest on a wire screen 15 to 
60 minutes before they are dropped into frying 
fat. This resting period, helps produce dough- 
nuts with desired expansion, grain and texture. 

Frying : To produce quality doughnuts eco- 
nomically, it is necessary to keep the frying fat 
in the best possible condition. 

Deep frying subjects fat to strenuous treat- 
ment. Every precaution should be taken to keep 
frying fat up to standard at all times. The 



better the condition of frying fat, the better will 
be the taste and flavor of finished doughnuts. 
At the same time proper care of frying fat will 
prolong its frying life and result in more 
economical frying. 

How to Keep Frying Fat in Best 
Possible Condition 

1. Avoid heating frying fat to high tempera- 
tures (above 400 °F.). 

2. Regulate heating of frying fat to eliminate 
hot spots. 

3. Strain out, regularly, burnt food particles 
which accumulate during frying. 

4. Reduce temperature of frying fat to 250° 
F. during periods when no food is being fried. 

5. Fry in the smallest quantity of fat that is 
practical and thus insure rapid turnover of 
fresh fat. 

6. Clean frying kettles thoroughly after each 
24-hour frying period. Rinse thoroughly so that 
no particle of cleaning product is left which 
may contaminate the frying pan.

les 



Production Pointers 

Pie Crust: A good pie consists of a good fill- 
ing and a good crust. 

To make good pie crust, proper mixing and an 
adequate amount of shortening are necessary. 

Causes For Tough Crust: 

Too little shortening 

Too much water 

Shortening and flour are not properly 

blended before water is added 
Pie dough is overmixed after water is added 

Pie dough formulas on pages 399 and 400, 
can De usea lor making varied types of pie 
crust by varying mixing procedure. 

Three Types Of Pie Crust: 

1. Flaky type crust 

2. Short mealy type crust 

3. Short flaky type crust 

Mixing Methods: 

1. Flaky Type Crust: Mix all the shortening 
with all the flour to obtain an irregular mix- 
ture, so that small lumps of fat remain through- 
out the mixture. 

Add cold water and incorporate. This dough 



requires more water than other type do ighs. 
because less flour is coated with fat, hence more 
water is absorbed by flour. 

2. Short Mealy Type Crust: Mix all the 
shortening thoror.i,"hly with V2 the flour. Add 
balance of flour and mix in to break up creamed 
mass. Add cold water. Mix just enough to 
properly incorporate water. 

3. Short Flaky Type Crust: Mix V2 the 
shortening with all the flour until a thorough 
distribution of fat is obtained. 

Acid balance of shortening. Mix in lightly so 
that small lumps remain throughout dough. 

Add cold water and mix just enough to prop- 
erly incorporate. 

Handling The Dough: When pie dough is 
made up into pies, there is a certain amount of 
dough trimmings left. Utilizing this dough, by 
making up into additional pies, is not too satis- 
factory since additional working of the dough 
may give a tough finished crust. 

Dough trimmings are best utilized by blend- 
ing them into a new batch of pie dough in 
amounts up to about 25 per cent of the weight 
of fresh dough. The trimming should be blended 
with flour and shortening. 



• 398 



Baking: Pies bake best when there is a good 
solid bottom heat in the oven. 

Bake fruit pies, in general, at 425° F. to 

450° F. 
Bake custard, pumpkin and soft pies at 

about .400° F. 
Bake pie shells for soft cream type pies at 

about 425° F. 



Fillings 



Fruit Fillings: Vary the amount of sugar in 
proportion to the tartness of the fruit in mak- 
ing fruit pies. The formulas in this book have 
a sugar content adjusted for fruits of average 
tartness. 

A good fruit pie should "run" slightly when 
cut. Use a minimum amount of flour, corn- 
starch, tapioca or other thickeners. 

Soft Fillings: Eggs, cornstarch, flour or 
tapioca are the thickening ingredients usually 
used for soft type pies. Eggs are best but are 
more expensive than other thickeners. 

Economy and quality can be procured by 
using both cornstarch or another thickening in- 
gredient of this type together vv^ith eggs, in soft 
fillings. 



Separation In Baking: Separation during 
baking, resulting in a finished pie with a 
"honeycomb" filling, is often encountered in 
custard pie fillings. This may be due to baking 
at a too high temperature (above 400° F.) or 
using insufficient eggs or cornstarch in the fill- 
ing. 

Toppings: Soft pies are usually finished with 
an egg-white meringue. Occasionally the me- 
ringue becomes watery and tends to break down. 
This gives the. pie an unappetizing appearance 
and disagreeable eating qualities. 

To Eliminate Difficulties With Watery Me- 
ringue 

Use ample amounts of egg whites. Use at 
least 1 pound of egg whites for each 
pound of sugar in meringue formula. 

Brown the meringue at 400° F. A tempera- 
ture much higher or much lower than 
400° F. will cause the development of a 
watery meringue after the pie is baked. 

Check the amount of stabilizer (corn- 
starch, tapioca, flour, etc.) in the me- 
ringue formula. Up to 4 ounces of 
stabilizer can be used for each 2 pounds 
of egg whites.

Production Pointers 

Mixing 

The character of the finished cookie depends 
upon proper mixing of the ingredients. 

Cookie doughs should be put together by 
simply adding all ingredients to mixing bowl 
and mixing until properly blended. This can be 
accomplished under most conditions in 2 or 3 
minutes, using medium speed on mixing ma- 
chine. 



Over-Mixing 

Over-mixing produces a tight dough which 
will not "spread" properly during baking. The 
cookies tend to become tough, have tight grain 
and close texture. 

Under-mixing produces a coarse dough which 
may cause cookies to spread excessively during 
baking. This may result in producing cookies 
with distorted shapes, too large in diameter, no 
volume, coarse grain and harsh texture. 

Control of Spread 

The spread, or lateral expansion of the 
cookie on the pan, should be carefully controlled 
in order to produce a finished cookie of excel- 
lent shape and texture. 

Vary The Amount Of Sugar: The amount of 
sugar in the dough has an effect on spread. In- 
creased sugar causes greater spread in cookies 
during baking. By varying the sugar it is pos- 
sible to adjust the spread. 

Vary The Amount Of Moisture : Spread is 
also influenced by the amount of moisture in 
the cookie dough. Slack doughs spread more 
during baking than do stiff doughs. Variations 
in moisture, therefore, should be used to control 
the spread of finished cookies. 

Soda: Soda also affects spread of the cookie 
during baking. More soda produces a greater 
spread. Exact specifications for soda given in 
the formulas should be followed. 



Baking 

Proper baking at the correct temperatures 
for the correct length of time is most important 
in making good cookies. 

If attention is not given to proper baking, 
a cookie poor in flavor, eating qualities and ap- 
pearance may result even though a good for- 
mula has been used, quality ingredients em- 
ployed and careful handling of dough followed. 
Use information in the following paragraphs 
as a guide in baking cookies. 

Bake cookies on pans which are 

1. Greased and floured for cookie doughs 
high in moisture 

2. Greased for average rich doughs 

3. Ungreased for doughs rich in shorten- 
ing 

Give careful attention to condition of pans 
before the cookies are dropped on them. This 
may eliminate sticking. 

Cookies may stick when pans 

Are not clean 

Are dry 

Are not conditioned properly. New pans 

should be lightly greased and baked in a 

hot oven (450° F.) about 4 hours before 

using. 
Are not thoroughly greased 
Are uneven on bottom. Heat from oven 

will not reach cookies evenly on battered, 

bent or scratched pans. 

Temperatures 

Most cookies are baked at temperatures be- 
tween 375° F. and 400° F. 

Cookies should be baked at constant heat. 
Flash heat should be avoided. Double panning 
is often essential in ovens where bottom heat is 
excessive and cannot be easily controlled. 

It is a good practice always to under-bake 
cookies slightly since there is enough heat in 
cookie pans to complete baking process after 
removing from oven. Over-baking dries out 
cookies and impairs the normal good flavor and 
texture.
