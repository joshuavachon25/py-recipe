PREFACE 



There is a very mistaken notion at the North and West, about 
the domestic life of Southerners, Southern women especially. 

The common idea is, that we are entirely destitute of practical 
knowledge of household affairs. This is a great mistake. The 
contrary is true. 

A Southern woman must know how to prepare any dish, for she 
finds no cooks made to order ; they must be of her own training, in 
the minutest particulars of every department. 

Northern housekeepers, in all the large towns and cities, do not 
have to depend on their own skill for the delicacies of every de- 
scription that make up the dainties of the table, but we Southern 
housewives, even in our larger towns and cities, all do ; and North- 
ern visitors stand aghast at the amount of labor summoned up in 
the filling of our store-rooms, and it is difficult to convince them 
that we trust these preparations to no one else. 

I found every cook-book 1 took up so deficient in economy, that 
I determined to make one for my own guidance, — the best method 
of enriching a larder, as well as of insuring success. 

Hence, the exactness of measures given. My book is entirely 
practical, — nothing else. It contains no theoretic dissertations on 
the culinary art, but is made up of Receipts which have been my 
daily assistants for twelve years, in the management of my house, 
and the preparation of various dishes served for large and small 
companies. 
It treats of the preparation of 

Soups, Fish, Meats, Poultry, etc. ; 
Vegetables, Pickles, Catsups, etc. ; 
Bread, Pastry, Paddings, etc. ; 
Cakes, Preserves, Jellies, &c. ; 
Syrups, Creams, Cordials, &c,

with a few miscellaneous receipts added, relating to care of stores 
and house generally. A regular breakfast-cake of George Washing- 
ton's, obtained from a relative of his, in Virginia, will attract great 
attention. 

I am largely indebted to an -English friend for many of my prep- 
arations, and, after following these directions for twelve years, can 
safely recommend them. Of course, many of our dishes are pecu- 
liar to the " South," as the various preparations of Rice, Corn Meal, 
and even our Bread-making. Our method of preparing Meats is 
more like that employed in French cookery. 

At the repeated solicitations of friends, living in all parts of 
the " South," I have decided to give this private experience of 
twelve years' daily practice to the public, and ask those who are 
interested, to look with favor on Dixie Cookery.

DIXIE COOKERY 



SOUPS. 



Beef Soup. 

Put four pounds of fresh beef into four quarts of cold 
water, with a little salt and pepper. Set it where it will boil 
slowly, but constantly. Skim it well and cover close. About 
an hour before it is done, skim off all the fat. Then of 
potatoes, turnips, tomatoes, and celery, take a teacupful of 
each, chopped fine, and half a teacupful of ochra sliced thin, 
or a less quantity of dried ochra. Grate a large carrot 
and add it for the coloring of the soup. If more water is re- 
quired, use boiling water. A half an hour before serving the 
dinner, put in a thickening. made of three tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour, one of browned sugar, and three gills of cold 
water, mixed thoroughly, and salt and pepper to the taste. A 
portion of the beef may be cut up in small pieces, and served 
in the soup. If the meat and vegetables are not desired in 
the soup, they may be removed by straining it. This soup 
will require four hours to boil. Plenty of time must be al- 
lowed in making soup, and a gentle heat is better than fast 
boiling. The vegetables and flavorings must be in such pro- 
portion as that no one shall predominate, and experience w T ill 
best decide the exact quantity of each. 



Mock Turtle Soup. 

Boil a calf's head, a few slices of ham, a head of celery, 
and a bunch of thyme, and parsley, in two gallons of water 
for five hours. When they have boiled an hour, take out the 
1* . 5

head and cut up the meat into inch-square pieces. Let the 
soup boil half an hour longer, strain it and return the meat 
to it. Season with the juice of a lemon, and salt and pepper. 
An hour before dinner, put in a thickening of browned flour 
and butter and water. A few minutes before serving, throw 
in egg-balls made of grated }^olks of hard-boiled eggs, a little 
flour and beaten yolk of egg about the size of partridge eggs. 
Lastly, put in a half a pint of good wine and a tablespoonful 
of browned sugar, and send to table immediately. 



Squirrel Soup. 

Cut up two young squirrels, and put them in a pot with five 
quarts of cold water. Season with salt and pepper. Let 
them boil until the meat is very well done, and remove it 
from the liquor, and cut it up into small pieces. Put in the 
soup a quarter of a pound of butter mixed with a little flour, 
and a pint of cream. Throw in the cut meat, and just before 
you serve it add the beaten 3'olks of two eggs and a little 
parsley. Chicken soup is nice made in the same way, with the 
addition of a pint of green corn cut from the cob, and put in 
when it is half done. 

Oyster Soup. 

Strain the liquor from two quarts of oysters, add to it an 
equal quantity of water. Put it on to boil, and skim it. Then 
throw in a little white pepper, a head of celeiy cut in small 
pieces, and a third of a pound of butter with two teaspoon- 
fuls of flour rubbed in it. Boil it five minutes longer, and 
put in the oysters and a pint of cream, and after one more 
boil pour into the tureen, in which have some toasted bread 
cut in dice, and a little finely-cut parsley. 



Green Pea Soup. 

Cut up a small chicken, or take a few slices of ham and 
boil it until the meat is entirely done. Remove the chicken 
or meat, and throw into the liquor a quart of shelled peas, 
and some pepper and salt. Set on the fire and boil until they 
are entirely done, and here thicken the soup, when you may 



SOUPS. 



add another pint of peas previously boiled in a different ves- 
sel, and a lump of butter the size of a goose egg. 



Oclira Soup. 

Take three pounds of fresh lean beef, or a fine fat chicken, 
and simmer in a gallon and a half of water for two hours. 
Skim off the fat and season with salt and pepper. Cut up a 
small portion of the meat, and return it to the soup. Add 
a teacupful of sliced green ochra or a half a teacupful of dried 
ochra, and a teacupful of tomatoes peeled and sliced. Boil 
until the meat is in shreds, and the vegetables are all to 
pieces. 

Vegetable Soup* 

Put a pint of Lima beans, a half a dozen large tomatoes, 
two teacupfuls of corn cut from the cob, a few snap beans, 
and two teaspoonfuls of dried ochra, into five quarts of water, 
with three slices of lean ham. Boil for two hours, and season 
with salt and pepper. Remove the ham before sending to 
table. Thicken with yellow of egg and a little flour. 

A nice winter-soup is made by boiling a few slices of lean 
ham, half a pint of dried Lima beans, a few heads of celery 
cut up, and turnips and potatoes sliced thin. A fourth of a 
teacupful of dried oclira will be a nice addition, and a grated 
carrot, or half a teacupful of stewed tomatoes, preserved in 
cans, will improve the color. If thickening is required, add 
some made of browned flour and water. Two tablespoonfuls 
of pepper-sauce will improve it. Put it in after it is in the 
tureen. 

Vermicelli Soiqj. 

Put four pounds of any kind of fresh meat except pork, 
into a gallon of cold water, cover close, and boil gently until 
the meat is tender. Throw in a head or two of celeiy, and 
half an hour afterwards take it from the fire, strain it, and 
return it to the pot. Season with salt and pepper. Add ver- 
micelli, which has been scalded in boiling water, in the pro- 
portion of four ounces to two quarts of soup. Let it boil ten 
minutes, and pour into the tureen. 



DIXIE COOKERY. 



Noodle Soup. 

Is made in the same way, except that strips of paste are 
substituted for the vermicelli. The paste is prepared by beating 
three eggs very light, and making them into a stiff dough 
with flour and water. They are then kneaded well and rolled 
very thin, cut into narrow strips, and dried on dishes in the 
sun, or a moderate oven. They must be soaked a few min- 
utes before putting them in the soup, and will require a little 
more boiling than vermicelli. 



FISH. 

Boiled Rock Fish. 



After the fish has been nicely cleaned, puc it into a pot 
with water enough to cover it, and throw in salt in the pro- 
portion of half a teaspoonful to a pound of fish. Boil it 
slowly until the meat is tender, and easily cleans from the 
bone. A large fish will require an hour to cook. When 
done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few hard-boiled eggs, 
cut in. thin slices, laid around it and over it. Have egg-sauce 
in a boat to eat with it. 



To boil Salt Shad or Mackerel. 

If very salt, the fish must be soaked twelve hours in plenty 
of cold water. Or if the water is changed, a shorter time 
will be required. Put it into a skillet or frying-pan, with cold 
water enough to cover it, and let it boil fifteen minutes. Then 
change the water for fresh hot water, and after boiling in this 
fifteen minutes longer, take it up and serve with drawn but- 
ter, and garnish with parsley. Another nice way to dress 
salt fish, is to boil together for ten minutes a teacup of cream,, 
some cut parsley, and a little butter and pepper, and if the 
cream is not very thick, a beaten yolk of egg, and pour it 
over the fish when it is ready to send to the table. 



FISH. 



To boil Salt Salmon. 

Let it soak twelve hours, and boil slowly for two, when 
serve with drawn butter. 

Salmon is nicely pickled thus : After boiling as above, cut 
it up in pieces four inches square, and put into a jar, and 
pour over it hot vinegar, in which a few whole grains of pep- 
per and allspice have been boiled. Serve this cold for lunch- 
eon or tea. It will keep two weeks, if the weather is cool. 



To bake a Shad. 

Prepare a stuffing of bread crumbs, salt, pepper, butter, 
and parsley, and mix this up with beaten yolk of egg, fill the 
fish with it, and tie a string around it. Pour over it a little 
water and some butter, and bake as you would a fowl. A 
shad will require from an hour to an hour and a quarter to 
bake. 

Rock fish is baked in the same wa}^, but requires a longer 
time to cook. 

Stewed Oysters. 

Take the liquor from five hundred oysters, and strain and 
boil the one-half of it. Add Ihree-quarters of a pound of 
butter to the boiling liquor, and when it is melted put in the 
oysters. As soon as they have commenced boiling, take them 
out, and throw them in cold water to give them firmness. 
Whilst the oysters are in the cold water, stir into the boiling 
liquor a pint of sweet cream. 

When the mixture boils again, return the oysters to it, and 
simmer a few minutes until Uiey are thoroughly heated, and 
they are ready to serve. 



Scalloped Oysters. 

Fill a buttered dish with alternate la3 r ers of oysters, hard- 
boiled eggs, grated bread-crumbs, pepper, butter, and salt, 
taking care to have a thick layer of crumbs on top. Place in 
a hot oven, and bake from twenty to thirty minutes. You 



10 DIXIE COOKERY. 

may add spice if j^ou like it. No oyster liquor need be put 
in, as there will be enough when they are cooked. 



Fried Oysters. ■ 

Select the finest sized oysters, drain them, and season with 
salt and pepper. Beat up an egg, and dip them first in it, 
and then in corn-meal or grated cracker, and fry in hot butter. 
Serve on a hot dish. 



Oyster Pie. 

Strain the liquor from the oysters, and put it on to boil with 
butter, and pepper, and a thickening of bread-crumbs and 
milk well beaten together, and after boiling a few minutes, 
throw in the oysters. Let them remain five minutes, take 
them off, and when warm add the beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Line a buttered dish with a rich paste, and fill with white 
paper or a clean napkin, to support a lid of paste, and bake 
it. When lightly browned, take off the lid, remove the. nap- 
kin, pour in the oysters, set a few minutes in the oven, and 
send to table hot. 



Plain Oyster Pie. 

Fill a deep dish with two quarts of oysters (uncooked and 
without the liquor), and season with butter, pepper, salt, and 
grated bread. Cover with strips of paste crossed. It will 
require a quick heat for half an hour, to cook it. Three- 
quarters of a pound of butter to two quarts of oysters, will 
make a rich pie. 



To pickle Oysters. 

To the liquor of one hundred oysters, add one teacup of 
vinegar. Boil and skim it, and put in the oj^sters with a 
tablespoonful of salt, and the same quantity of pepper, and let 
the whole simmer a few minutes together. 

In cold weather, they will keep several days. 



FISH. 11 



To stew Terrapins. 

Wash two terrapins in warm water, and throw them into a 
pot of boiling water, which will kill them instantty. Let them 
boil until the shells crack, when they must be taken from the 
fire, the shells taken off, and the entrails removed. Wash 
them, and cook until tender, when the gall must be carefully 
removed, and the sandbag and liver taken out. Put the flesh, 
cut up, into a stewpan, with the liquor it has been boiled in, and 
season with salt, Cayenne pepper, and butter, and stew them 
half an hour. 

Then add a thickening of the beaten yolks of two eggs, 
some butter rolled in Hour, and two wineglasses of Madeira 
wine. Serve on a chafing-dish. 



Lobster Salad. 

Make a dressing of the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs, 
some salt and pepper, a little oil and mustard, and some 
vinegar. 

Make these ingredients into a smooth paste, about the con- 
sistency of thick cream. Mash the coral meat of the lobster, 
and with a little cold water, just enough to soften it, and cut 
up a head of lettuce into small pieces, and mix with it. Sea- 
son the lettuce and meat with Cayenne pepper and a little 
salt, and mix them with the dressing just before sending to 
table. 

The different condiments must be in such proportion that 
no one shall predominate.* 



To fry Clams. 

After opening them, wash them in their own liquor, drain 
them, and make a batter of an egg, flour, and pepper. Dip 
them in this, and fry in hot butter. 



12 DIXIE COOKERY. 

EGGS. 

Omelet. 

Beat eight eggs with some salt, a little chopped parsley, 
and a teacup -of cream. Put two ounces of butter into a skil- 
let, and when it is melted pour in the mixture, and stir with 
a spoon until it begins to foam. Shake a little pepper over 
it, and dish it with one half folded over the other. 



Oyster Omelet. 

Beat six eggs well, and add by degrees a gill of cream, and 
pepper and salt to your taste. Have ready one dozen large 
oysters cut in halves ; pour the eggs into a pan of hot butter, and 
drop the oysters over it as equally as possible. Fry to a light 
brown and serve as an omelet. It must not be turned. 



Poached Eggs. 

Have some boiling water in a skillet over a quick fire. 
Break the eggs into it carefully, and sprinkle salt over them. 
"When the white is well set take them up with an egg-spoon, 
pour over a little melted butter, season with black pepper, 
and serve on J>uttered toast. Or you may omit the toast and 
add a little vinegar to the melted butter. 



To boil Eggs. 

If you wish them quite soft, drop them into boiling water for 
two minutes and a half, but three minutes will be necessary 
if you wish the yolk set slightly. Ten minutes will be re- 
quired for eggs for salad, or dressing poultry, and they should 
be dropped into. cold water for a few minutes to cool. If } 7 ou 
use a tin boiler without a spirit-lamp, pour boiling water on 
the eggs for five minutes, and then replace it with a fresh sup- 
ply of boiling water ; send to table, and in five minutes more 
they will be ready to eat. 



EGGS. 13 



Scrambled Eggs. 



Beat six or eight eggs very light, add a little salt, and put 
into a warm frying-pan with some butter. Stir them until 
they are well thickened, but not hard ; sprinkle a little pepper 
over them, and send to table in a hot dish. 



Eggs and Potatoes. 

Remove the skins from some boiled Irish potatoes, and 
when perfectly cold cut them up in small pieces about the size 
of a grain of corn, and season with salt and pepper. To a 
quart of potatoes thus prepared, take the yolks of six eggs, 
and the whites of three, and beat them well together. Have 
some butter in a frying-pan, and when it is melted put in the 
potatoes. When they are quite hot stir in the eggs, and con- 
tinue stirring so as to mix them well with the potatoes, and 
until the eggs are set. Then pepper, and send them to table 
in a hot dish. 



Eggs and Rice. 

Take six eggs and beat them well. Have a quart of cooked 
rice well boiled and steamed, and when perfectly dry, stir in 
the eggs and season with salt, and serve on a hot dish. The 
proportion of egg is one to every tablespoonful of rice. Cold 
rice is nice dressed in this manner for breakfast. If you use 
rice cooked, the previous day stir in a little butter with it 
when you put it in the kettle to soften. 



Eggs and Cheese. 

Beat up eight eggs to a thick froth, put in a little salt, a 
half a teacup of grated cracker and three tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese. Tut into a frying-pan with some butter, and 
cook and serve as an omelet. 



14 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Eggs and Beef. 






Chip some dried beef, and pour boiling water over it to 
freshen it. Pour off the water and put a little butter into the 
skillet with the meat. . When it is hot stir in three or four 
eggs until they are well mixed with the meat ; pepper, and 
send to the breakfast-table hok 



To Preserve Eggs for Winter Use. 

Pack them with the small ends downwards, and put in al- 
ternate layers of salt and eggs until the vessel is full. Or 
pour three gallons of hot water on a pint of lime, and a half 
a pint of salt. When it is cold, pour over the eggs and keep 
in a cool place. One cracked egg will spoil them all. The 
best test of the freshness of eggs is dropping them into a 
pan of cold water. Those that sink are fresh enough to pack 
away. 



SAUCES 

Drawn Butter. 



Mix well together a quarter of a pound of butter, and one 
tablespoonful of flour. Put a pint of water into a rice-kettle, 
and when it boils stir in the flour and butter. Season with 
salt and white pepper, and eelery if in season, removing the 
stalks of celery before sending to the table. It will require 
but a few minutes' boiling, and must be stirred constantly. 



Egg Sauce 

Is made as drawn butter, with the addition of six hard- 
boiled eggs cut in small pieces, and stirred in a few minutes 
before removing from the fire. This sauce is usually served 
with fish. 



SAUCES. 15 



Celery Sauce. 

Cut up a large bunch of celery into small pieces. Use onty 
that which is blanched, throwing aside the green tops. ' Put it 
into a pint of water and boil until it is tender. Then add a 
teaspoonful of flour and a lump of butter the size of an egg, 
mixed well together. Season with salt and white pepper, and 
stir constantly until removed from the fire. It is nice with 
boiled poultry. 



Celery Sauce for Cold Turkey. 

Boil six eggs until the}' are hard, and drop into cold water 
to prevent the whites from discoloring. Mash the } r olks to a 
smooth paste, with three tablespoonfuls of cold water, three 
tablespoonfuls of oil, one of mustard, and four of good vine- 
gar. Salt and pepper to your taste. Add half a pint of 
drawn butter, and when all are well mixed, stir in a half a 
pint of cut celery, and serve at once. 



Oyster Sauce. 

Set the oysters in their liquor over the fire for a few minutes 
until the}' look plump. Then remove them from the liquor 
and stir into it some flour and butter rubbed together ; some 
salt and pepper. Stir it well, and when it has boiled ten 
minutes throw in the oysters, and add a glass of white wine, 
if you like it, and serve immediately. This is a "nice accom- 
paniment to boiled fowls. 



Caper Sauce. 

To a pint of drawn butter add one tablespoonful of fresh 
butter, two of capers, and two of vinegar, or the juice of a 
lemon. Throw in a little salt and pepper, and after stirring 
over the fire for ten minutes pour into the sauce-tureen, and 
send to table. 

Pickled nasturtiums are an admirable substitute for capers, 
and pickled cucumbers, cut fine, may be used. 



16 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Tomato Sauce. 



Stew a dozen large tomatoes with Cayenne pepper, and salt 
until they become like a marmalade. Pass them through a 
sieve to remove the seeds, and stir until it is of the consist- 
ency of very thick cream. Then add a half a pint of nice 
broth and a little butter. Or if you have no broth, a little 
warm water, and an ounce and a half of butter, with two 
tablespoonfuls of grated cracker, or bread may be stirred in 
just before sending to table. In seasoning this sauce use 
very little pepper. It will be a nice accompaniment to beef- 
steak, or beef a-la-mode, or cold roast beef. 



Mint Sauce, 

Take the leaves of young mint and cut up finely, and to 
three tablespoonfuls of chopped mint add one of sugar, and 
vinegar sufficient to moisten the mint and sugar well. Put in 
a little salt, and serve with roast lamb. 



MEATS, POULTRY, Etc. 

To boil a Turkey or Pair of Fowls. 

After the turkey is well cleaned, it should lie in salt and 
water for a few minutes. Fill the body with a stuffing of 
bread anct butter, salt, pepper, and parsley. If oysters are in 
season, a dozen large ones, minced fine, are a nice addition. 
Pin the poultry in a towel, and put it into boiling water, with 
a little salt, and a head of celery in it. When half done, add 
a pint of milk. It must not boil very fast, or it will break to 
pieces. 

A small turkey will boil in an hour and a half, and a large 
one in three hours. A pair of fowls will require from an hour 
to an hour and a half, according to their age. If oysters are 
added to the stuffing, the poultry must be served with oyster' 
sauce. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 17 



To boil Beef Tongue , Corned Beef etc. 

Let the tongue soak in cold water for twelve hours 
previous to boiling. Then put it into a pot of cold water, 
and let it boil slowly for three hours. Serve with mashed 
Irish potato on the same dish. If you have two tongues for 
dinner, place one in the centre of the dish, cut up the other 
in slices, and serve on the mashed potato, and garnish with 
parsley. Or you may serve without the potato, and drop a 
small quantity of lemon or cranberry jelly on each of the cut 
slices of tongue, and border with sprigs of parsley laid around 
on the dish. 

Corned beef should be well soaked, and boiled slowly, 
skimming it well. A piece of meat weighing ten or twelve 
pounds, will require from three to four hours' boiling. 



To boil a Leg of Mutton. 

Cut the end of the knuckle from the leg, and put it into a pot 
with boiling water enough to cover it. Throw in a little salt, 
and let it simmer slowly for three hours and a half. If more 
water is required, pour in boiling water from the kettle. It 
must be well done. Serve with caper sauce. Have a plate 
of current jelly beside it. 



To boil a Tripe. 

After cleansing the tripe thoroughly, wash it well, trim off 
the fat, put it into cold water, and boil it until it is tender. An 
hour before it is taken from the fire, add a quart of milk to 
the water. When it is cold, put it into a deep bowl, and cover 
with weak vinegar. It will keep thus a week, if the weather 
is cold. 

To boil Pigs' Feet. 

First clean them well by dipping them in scalding water, 
8,nd scraping off the hairs and hoofs, after which put them 
into weak salt and water for a day. They are then ready to 
boil for souse. 

2* 



18 DIXIE COOKERY. 

If, however, you wish to keep them for frying, or stewing, 
they may be preserved in this weak salt and water for three 
or four weeks. If the weather is warm, the salt and water 
may require to be changed. They must be soaked in fresh 
w T ater all night, before boiling them: Boil them in cold water 
until tender. 

To boil a Ham. 

Soak the ham overnight, and put it into cold water and let 
it cook slowty, very slowly, for four or five hours in a covered 
vessel. Skim it, leaving a small piece upon the knuckle, 
which carve handsomely, and serve with a paper frill tied 
around the knuckle-bone, or some fine bunches of curled 
parsley. If the ham is more than a year okl, soak it well, 
and boil it for six or seven hours — changing the water three 
or four times. 

To roast a Pig. 

Rub the inside of the pig with pepper and salt, and fill the 
body with a stuffing of bread, butter, parsley, sage, and 
thyme, softened with a little hot water, and beaten yolk* of 
egg, and sew it up with a strong thread. Put the pig on the 
spit, first flouring the skin, that it may be crisp. Put a pint 
and a half of water into the dripping-pan, a spoonful of lard, 
and a little salt, and baste the pig frequently with this, and 
turn often, so that every part will be well clone. When the skin 
begins to get stiff, grease it with butter or lard, and baste it 
no more after this, or it will blister. A pig will require from 
three to four hours to roast. Chop up the heart and liver, 
previously boiled in water, and add to the gravy in the drip- 
ping-pan, with salt, thyme, and brown flour, and water, as a 
thickening. Apple-sauce, cold slaw, and cranberries, are the 
usual accompaniments of roast pig. 



To roast a Leg of Pork. 

Cut the skin in squares, season with salt and pepper, and 
"* baste with salt and water. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 19 



Roast Beef. 

Season the beef with -pepper and salt, and skewer it well to 
the spit. Pat a pint of water and a little lard in the drip- 
ping-pan. Turn the meat frequently. Baste it with the 
liquid in the dripping-pan, and a short while before it is 
clone, dredge a little flour over it. When the beef is nearly 
done, pour the gravy into a skillet, and thicken it with a 
little brown flour and water rubbed together. If too fat, 
remove the top by skimming it. It will be most likely to suit 
all tastes if one-half of the meat is well done, and the other 
side less cooked, so as to furnish rare slices for those who 
prefer it thus. Grated or scraped horse-radish is nice with 
beef thus cooked. 

To roast Mutton. 

Baste the meat with salt and water, and roast very slowly 
at first. Turn the spit, that it may be equally done. Dredge 
over a little flour, and baste the meat with its own gravy 
about a half an hour before sending it to the table. Pour a 
glass of wine in the gravy. Let it boil up once, and pour in 
the sauce-tureen. 

Serve currant jelly with it. 



To roast a Turkey. 

Wash the turkey very clean, and let it lie in weak salt and 
water over night. When ready to put to roast, rub it dry in 
the inside, and sprinkle in a little pepper. Make a stuffing 
of two-thirds wheat bread and one-third corn bread, rubbed 
fine, and 'softened with butter and beaten yolk of egg, and 
seasoned with salt, pepper, parsley, and celery. Mix the 
stuffing well together, and fill the turkey. Rub the breast of 
the turkey with salt, pepper, and butter. Have water and 
lard in your dripping-pan, and baste often. It will require 
three hours to roast. Pea fowl and Guinea fowl are roasted 
and dressed in the same way. 

Cranberry-sauce is almost indispensable with this dish. 
Celery, too, usually accompanies it.

To roast a Goose, 

Have the goose prepared the night previous to cooking. 
Fill the body with a stuffing of bread, sage, ttryme, a little 
onion', and some mashed Irish potatoes, and a very little but- 
ter. Add salt and pepper and yolk of egg, and baste the 
same as a turkey. Pour off most of the fat that drips from 
the goose, or the gravy will be too rich. The gravy is the 
same as for turkey. Apple-sauce to be served with it. 



To roast a Duck. 

Prepare it for the spit in the same way as a goose. Stuff 
with sage, onion, thyme, bread-crumbs, and butter, and baste 
them well with salt and water and their own gravy. It will 
require an hour to cook. Serve with currant jelly or apple- 
sauce. Muscovy ducks should be pinned up in a cloth, and 
buried in the earth twelve hours before cooking, to extract 
the strong flavor they have. They must be dressed for cook- 
ing before being: buried. 



Boasted Chickens. 

Stuff and baste them as turkeys are done, and serve with 
cranberry or celery-sauce. 



To bake a Beef's Heart. 

Cut it open, remove the ventricles, and let it soak an hour 
in lukewarm water, to free it from the blood. Wipe dry with 
a cloth, and parboil in a little water for twenty minutes. Make 
a rich stuffing, fill the heart with it, and secure it with a string. 
Let it bake an hour and a half, or two hours, with a half a 
pint of water, in the oven or dripping-pan. The gravy will 
not 'need any thickening, but will be improved by a glass of 
wine. Serve in a chafing-dish, and with currant, or any acid 
jelly. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 21 



Beef a-la-Mode. 

-Take part of a round of beef, bone it, and make incisions, 
which are filled with a stuffing of bread, butter, thyme, pep- 
per, salt, a little minced onion, and yolk of egg. After the 
meat is stuffed, bind it with tape, and put in an oven, with 
water enough to cover it, and let it stew slowly for three 
hours. Keep a lid on the oven whilst it is stewiug, and if 
more water is needed, add boiling water. The gravy will 
require no thickening, but a glass of wine will improve it. 



Beef Steak. 

Have the steaks cut an inch thick, and beat them with a 
steak-mallet. Broil over good coals, and cook slowly. Turn 
frequently, and dip it in a gravy of butter, salt, and pepper, 
whenever you turn it. When done, serve in a chafing-dish, 
with melted butter poured over it. 



French SteaJc. 

Cut thin slices of cold roast beef, and put in a chafing-dish ; 
season with salt, pepper, walnut catchup, a little vinegar, a 
little warm water, and plenty of butter, with some browned 
flour rubbed into it. The meat should be entirely covered 
with the grav}'. Light the lamp and put on the lid of the 
chafing-dish, and let it steam thus, until the gravy is reduced 
two-thirds. A nice breakfast dish. 



To fry Liver. 

It should be cut across the grain in slices half an inch 
thick. Then put into a deep plate, and pour boiling water 
over it. . Let it lie*thus for a few minutes, drain it, and season 
with pepper and salt. Dip each piece in flour, and drop in 
hot lard. Let it be thoroughly done, but not hard. Make a 
gravy as for beef, and pour over it. 



22 DIXIE COOKERY, 



To fry Veal. 



Cut the meat in thin slices, rub with pepper and salt, dip 
in flour, and drop in a pan of hot lard. When of a fine 
brown, take it up, and make a gravy with cream or milk 
poured in the skillet, and pour over the veal. Garnish with 
parsley. 

Veal Cutlets. 

Cut the veal in slices three quarters of an inch thick. 
Season with salt and pepper, and dip in beaten yolk of egg, 
and then in grated cracker or bread-crumbs, and fry in hot lard. 
When the veal is done, take it up, and pour into the gravy some 
cream or milk, a little cut parsley, and some salt and pepper. 
Let it boil a few minutes, and pour over the veal, and send t 
table very hot. 



Mutton Chops. 



' 



Cut the chop an inch thick, and with or without bone. Rub 
the gridiron with a little suet, and put on the chops. Turn 
frequently, and when cooking, season with salt and pepper. 
Serve on a hot dish, with plenty of butter. 



Force Meat Balls. 

Take one pound of veal, a pound of suet, two slices of 
ham, and some crumbs of bread. Chop them fine, and mix 
with them the 3 r olks of two eggs. Season with thyme, pep- 
per, salt, and parsley. Roll in small balls, and fry them 
brown. They are nice in soups, and to garnish hashes 01 
roast veal. 

To bake Fowls. 

Season and stuff as for roasting. Put into a baking-pan or 
oven, with a pint of water to two chickens. If the chickens 
are young, split them down the back, and put into an oven with 
some water and butter. Rub some butter or lard on the 
breast, and dredge with flour. Baste with the gravy in the 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. • 23 

oven. Thicken the gravy with flour and butter and water 
mixed together.

To fricassee Chickens. 

Cut up the chickens, and put to soak in cold water for an 
hour ; then throw them in weak salt and water, and let them 
soak another hour. Tut them into a pot, with water enough to 
cover them, some salt, and pepper, and half a pint of cream 
or some milk. Add a tablespoonful of butter mixed with 
flour, and stew all together for an hour. 

Before it is dished, stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs, 
and a little finely-cut parsley or celery. 



Broiled Chickens. 

Split the chickens down the back, and let them lie all night 
in salt and water, if desired for breakfast. Put them on the 
gridiron over bright coals, and cover them with a plate, which 
will make them cook faster. Season them with butter, pep- 
per, and salt, whilst cooking. Boil the giblets in water, and 
chop them fine. Make a gravy of these, and a little of the 
water in which they were broiled, and some butter and cut 
parsley. Pour over the chickens, and serve on a hot dish. 



To fry CJiickens. 

Cut up the chickens, and let them lie in salt and water 
twenty minutes ; drain them, and season with salt and pep- 
per. Dip each piece separately in flour, and drop into a frying- 
pan of hot lard. When well browned, turn the other side to 
fry. Take up the chicken, and pour into the pan a little warm 
water, and a thickening of milk and flour, some salt, and a 
little butter. Let it boil a few minutes, and pour over the 
chickens. 

Chickens fried in batter are prepared in the same way, dip- 
ping them in a batter instead of flour, before frying them. 
The batter made of two eggs, a little salt, a teacup of milk, 
and flour enough to make a thin batter. Lard is nicer for 
frying them than butter. 



24 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Chicken Pie. 



Cut up the chickens into joints, and season them with salt, 
pepper, and parsley. If they are old, parboil them a few 
minutes, and save the water to put in the pie. Make rather 
a rich paste, and cover the_ bottom and sides of a deep dish 
with it. Then put in alternate layers of chicken, six hard- 
boiled eggs cut in slices, butter, pepper, celery, and a little 
flour from your clredging-box. Fill the dish two-thirds fall of 
cold water, and add half a teacup of cream or milk. Put on 
a top paste, and close the pie around the edge, and make an 
opening in the middle with a knife. 

It will require about an hour to bake. A few slices of lean 
ham is an addition liked by many persons. If oysters are in 
season, they are nice, put in alternate layers with the chicken. 



Chicken Pie ivith Pice. 

Cut up three young chickens into joints, and drop them into 
weak salt' and water for a half an hour. Have ready two 
quarts of rice boiled, but not steamed, into which stir a pound 
and a quarter of butter, a quart of milk, a little salt, and six 
well-beaten eggs. Put into your baking-dish half the quantity 
of this mixture, and place the chicken and a few slices of ham 
in it. Then pour in the remainder of the rice and egg, and 
rub a little flour and milk smoothly together, and put on the 
top, to make it brown nicely. This pie will be sufficient for 
twenty persons. 

Chicken Salad. 

Take two well-boiled chickens, and when cold, cut into 
small pieces, removing the skin and bone. Mix with this cut 
chicken four times as much cut celery (or lettuce-heads and 
celerymixed) as 3^011 have chicken. Season with salt and 
pepper to 3'our taste. Take the 3 T olks of eight hard-boiled 
eggs, and mash them to a yaste with the back of a spoon, 
using a few tablespoonfuls of cold water to soften them. To 
this add a little salt, four tablespoonfuls of made mustard, 
four tablespoonfuls of melted butter, and six spoonfuls of 
salad oil, with eight tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Hub these 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 25 

together until they are quite smooth. Half an hour before 
the salad is sent to table, mix this dressing thoroughly with 
the chicken and celery. 



Venison Steaks. 

Broil over bright coals, basting frequently with butter, salt, 
and pepper, and serve on a chafing-dish with a gravy of but- 
ter, and port or claret wine in it, if desired. 



To roast Venison. 

Make a dough of flour and water, and roll it out an inch 
thick. Rub the meat with lard, and wrap the dough around 
it. When half done, remove the dough, and baste the meat 
frequently with butter, and water, and claret wine, and dredge 
with flour. It will require five or six hours to roast. Serve 
currant jelly with it. 

Make a sauce by skimming the fat from the gravy in the 
dripping-pan, and adding some butter with brown flour mixed 
in it, pepper, salt, and currant jelly, to your taste. Cold 
roasted venison makes fine French steak. 



Boasted Hare. 

Having trussed the hare, prepare a rich stuffing of corn and 
wheat bread, mixed and rubbed fine, butter, pepper, salt, 
tlryine, and beaten yolk of egg. Stuff the body of the hare 
and tie it up, and rub the skin with butter, and roast before 
the fire, as sucking pig is done. It will require from two to 
three hours to cook. Serve with currant jelly. Add wine to 
the gravy, if you like it. 



Rabbit Stew. 

Cook them with a little chopped onion in a stewpan, with 
water enough to cover them, and butter and cream, pepper 
and salt, added when they are nearly done. Or add nothing 
but butter and wine to the gravy.

Wild Ducks. 



After they are cleaned, and ready for cooking, wrap them 
in a clean cloth, and bury twelve hours in the earth, to remove 
the strong flavor of this bird. They are usually cooked with- 
out stuffing. Three-quarters of an hour will be sufficient to 
cook them. 

When you dish it, draw a sharp knife three times through 
the breast, and pour over a gravy of a little hot butter, the 
juice of a lemon, a sprinkling of Cayenne pepper, a^nd a wine- 
glass of port wine. This is poured over as they go on the 
table. 

Fricassee of Squirrels. 

Put two young squirrels into a pot with two ounces of but- 
ter, one or two ounces of ham, some salt and pepper, and just 
water enough to cover them. Let them stew slowly until 
tender. Take them up, and pour half a teacup of cream and 
a beaten yolk of egg into the gravy, and when it has boiled 
five minutes, pour over the squirrels in the dish. Some 
persons prefer a wineglass of red wine, and omit the cream 
and egg. 

Fried Squirrel. 

Cut up and season with salt and pepper, and clip each piece 
in beaten yolk of egg and grated cracker, and fry in hot lard 
until of a nice brown. 

Squirrel Pie. 

Cut them up, and parboil in water, with a little salt in it, 
for half an hour. Then proceed as in chicken pie. 



Pigeon Pie. 

Having picked and cleaned five pigeons, stuff them with a 
stuffing of grated cold ham, some salt, and grated cracker, 
some pepper and butter. If asparagus is in season, the green 
tops may be substituted for the cracker.. Pour milk and water 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 27 

into the dish until the pigeons are nearly covered. Put a lid 
of paste on the top, and bake an hour. If you wish the 
pigeons very tender, parboil them twenty minutes, and use 
the water in which they are boiled to make the pie. 



Broiled Partridges. 

Cut them up the back, and lay them in salt and water for 
an hour. Baste frequently whilst on the gridiron with butter, 
salt and pepper. Serve on a chafing-dish. 



Baked Partridges. 

Pick and clean the birds, and stuff them with chopped pars- 
ley or celery, the yolks of hard-boiled eggs softened with 
melted butter, and some salt and pepper. Rub a little on the 
breasts, and dredge them with flour. Set them in a baking- 
pan in the stove, or in an oven, and pour a half pint of water 
around them, with a little butter in it. Baste occasionally 
with this gravy. They will require three quarters of an hour 
to cook. They may be cut up the back as for broiling, and 
baked without stuffing. 

A Partridge Pie. 

Take four partridges, and clean them nicely, and cut each 
one into four pieces. Season with plenty of butter, some 
salt and pepper, and put in six hard-boiled eggs sliced thin, 
and two heads of celery cut fine. Fill the dish half full with 
water, and pour in half a teacup of cream. Cover with a lid 
of paste, leaving a hole in the centre. If preferred, you may 
stuff the partridges with oysters and a lump of butter, instead 
of disjointing them. 

Turkey, and Chicken Hash. 

Break the bones and stew them in water for half an hour, 
and then remove them, and pour in the gravy left the previous 
day, and the chicken or turkey cut up in small pieces. Thicken 
with a little of the turkey from the body of the fowl, and 



28 DIXIE COOKERY. 

season with salt and pepper to the taste. Stew for half an 
hour in a covered vessel, and serve on toasted bread. 



Beef Hash. 

Make a rich gravy by stewing the fat of the beef, and the 
bones broken up, with a very little minced onion, in as ranch 
water as will cover them, for half an hour. Then put in a 
thickening made of a little water and brown flour, and salt 
and pepper to the taste. Cut up the beef in small pieces, and 
stew gently in this gravy for a half an hour. Stew in a deep 
dish with toasted bread in the bottom of it. Have the gravy 
the consistency of thick cream. 



Baked Hash. 

Cut up some cold beef into small pieces, slice some cold 
Irish potatoes, and put into a deep dish with some gravy left 
from the roast, and some butter, pepper, salt, cut parsley, and 
a little water, and bake about a half an hour in the stove or 
oven. 

To stew Pig's Feet. 

Boil four feet, take out the bones, and put them in a vessel 
with a little vinegar and water, a lump of butter the size of a 
goose egg, and some salt and pepper, and stew for a half an 
hour, and serve on a hot dish. Or they are nice dressed as 
terrapins. 

To fry Pig's Feet. 

Split them in halves lengthwise, dip them in batter, and fry 
in hot lard. They must previously have been soaked several 
hours in vinegar. 

You can fry them in vinegar and water without lard, and 
they will be very nice. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 29 



To cook Tripe. 

Make a batter of eggs, flour, and milk. Cut the tripe into 
pieces, three inches square, and dip in the batter, and fry in 
hot lard. Or you may dip in egg and grated cracker, and fry. 
Tripe is nice cut in small pieces, and stewed with butter, vin- 
egar, pepper and salt. 

Sausage Meat. 

To eighty pounds of chopped meat, which should be one- 
third fat and two-thirds lean, add two pounds of fine salt, one 
pint of pulverized sage, six ounces of ground pepper, and 
eight tablespoonfuls of brown sugar. Mix all well together. 



Bologna Sausage. 

Ten pounds of beef and two pounds of the fat of fresh 
pork. Chop fine and mix well together. Season with five 
ounces of fine salt, one ounce of black pepper, one half-ounce 
of cayenne, and one tablespoonful of powdered cloves. Put 
this mixture into skins tied tight, and lay in strong salt and 
water for ten days, turning them once or twice. Then hang 
them up to smoke a few days. They can be put in the same 
brine with corned beef or tongues. 



Liver Pudding. 

Take one hog's head, two livers, with the lights and heart, 
and boil all together. Skim the pot. When the livers are 
done remove them, and let the others boil longer. "When they 
are all done, take the bones from the meat, and chop all to- 
gether. Season with sage, thyme, salt, and pepper. Pack in 
jars while soft, and cut out in slices and fry as it is wanted. 



Scrapple. 

Take the scraps of pork and the heads, and boil in water 
until the meat is tender. Pick out the bones and chop it fine. 



30 DIXIE COOKERY. 

Strain the liquor, and pour it back into the pot. Put in the 
meat, and season with sage, and salt, and pepper, to the taste. 
Stir in corn meal until it is of the consistency of thick mush. 
Let it cook about twenty minutes, stirring constantly. Re- 
move from the fire and put in deep pans, and fry in thick 
slices. 

WJiite (Suet) Pudding. 

To two pounds of suet rubbed as fine as flour, one pound 
of corn-meal, and one and a half pounds of flour. Season 
with three tablespoonfuls of cinnamon (ground), two and a 
half tablespoonfuls of black pepper (ground), and a little more 
than four spoonfuls of salt. Mix these ingredients thor- 
oughly, and stuff with the fingers into the medium-sized skins 
of the beef, after they are well cleaned, and soaked in weak 
salt and water for twenty-four or thirty-six hours, changing 
the water once a day. Tie the ends of the skins tightly with 
strong thread, and throw the puddings into a pot of boiling 
water, and let them remain for a half an hour, or till thor- 
oughly clone. Prick them with a sharp fork before you put 
them in, to prevent them from bursting whilst boiling. Take 
them out of the water, and spread on waiters to dry in the 
sun, or air, until the e::ds are perfectly dry. Turn tjiem every 
day. If put away before the ends are dry, they will mould. 
Pack away in a box, and they will keep six months. When 
you cook them, drop them in boiling water for twenty min- 
utes, and then put them on a gridiron for ten minutes, and 
brown them, and send to table in a hot dish. 



A Nice Breakfast Relish. 

Chip some smoked beef, and drop into boiling water to 
soften. Let it lie ten minutes, and then put it into a skillet 
with a little boiling water, and stir gently for twenty minutes. 
Pour off the water, put in a little butter, and some pepper, and 
pour in a half a teacup of cream, five minutes before taking 
from the fire. 



MEATS, POULTRY, ETC. 31 



Corned Beef. 

Put the beef into cold water for twentj T -fonr hours, to draw 
off the blood. Let it drain well before putting it into the 
brine. Take one gallon of salt to eight gallons of water, one 
half a pound of saltpetre, a quart of molasses, a pint of sugar, 
and one or two pods of red pepper. Boil and skim it, and 
when perfectly cold, pour it over the beef. If the weather is 
warm, add one quart of salt to the above. If the pickle sours, 
pour it off, boil, let it cool, and pour over the meat again. 
Keep the meat under the brine by weights. 



To piclde Beef's Liver. \ 

"Wash the livers, and put them into a strong brine, and let 
them lie three weeks. Then hang and smoke them, as beef is 
done, until properly dry. 

They make a nice relish for breakfast by stewing them for 
half an hour in water, and dressing them with cream and cut 
parsley. They must be shaved thin like chip beef, and soaked 
ten minutes in warm water before stewing. 

Another way is to warm it up in a little butter, after it is 
soaked fresh. 

To cure Beef and Tongues, Dried Beef etc. 

Make a pickle, as for corned beef, and after the meat and 
tongues have lain in this three weeks, hang up and smoke 
until dry, but not hard. If the tongues are put up in 
autumn, whilst the weather is warm, a better way is to cut 
open the root of the tongue about an inch, and rub in the 
opening a little salt and saltpetre, and pack them away in 
salt. The water, adhering to the- tongues when washed, and 
the juice from them, will make a very strong brine, which will 
preserve them, in warm autumn weather, for a month or six 
weeks. Then hang and smoke. 

If the pieces of beef lie as long as six weeks in salt pickle, 
soak them twenty-four hours in cold water, before smoking 
them. A whole beef ham may be pickled thus. Legs of mut- 
ton, pickled as beef, are almost as nice as venison-ham, for 
chipping. 



32 DIXIE COOKERY. 

VEGETABLES. 

Asparagus. 

Put the stalks into bundles ; cut them the same length, tie 
up with strings, and boil in hot water without salt for three- 
quarters of an hour. Remove the strings, and serve on but- 
tered toast ; pour over some pressed butter, and season with 
pepper and salt. 

You may omit the toast, and add a little vinegar to the 
butter. The stalks must be scraped below the green head 
before boiling, and kept in water until ready to cook. If 
your bed does not yield a sufficient quantity of asparagus for 
a meal at one cutting, bury the cut stalks in the asparagus 
bed, pinned up in a cloth, until you have a dish full. 

Beans. 

String, and break them in halves ; boil in salt and water, 
and throw in a piece of soda the size of a pea, if they are old, 
or you wish them a fine color. Boil them for an hour and a 
half ; pour off the water, and dress with butter and cream, and 
sprinkle over some pepper. But a more common way is to 
boil them with a piece of thin middling. 

Lima Beans. 

Let them boil about an hour, and when the water is poured 
off, season with salt, pepper, and butter. Send to table hot. 
Dried Lima beans must be soaked over night, and boiled two 
hours, or until they are soft, and should have some cream 
added to the dressing. 

To boil Cabbage. 

Cut the heads in quarters, and wash in cold water, and boil 
with a piece of thin middling. Pour in fresh hot water from 
the kettle, when the cabbage is put on to boil, or it will be 
too rich. It will boil in a half an hour in winter, but before 



VEGETABLES. 33 

frost it will take an hour. It is nice, boiled with corned beef, 
skimming the pot well before putting it in. 



Stuffed Cabbage, 

Take a large, firm head of cabbage, put it into boiling 
water with some salt, and let it boil ten minutes. Take it 
out, and drain it, and carefully remove the heart, leaving the 
inside leaves whole. Boil three eggs hard, and cut fine, and 
mix in with a stuffing of bread-crumbs, butter, and pepper, 
and beaten yolk of one egg, and some raw, lean ham, minced 
fine. Fill the cabbage with this stuffing, and tie up the cab- 
bage with strips of cloth, to keep the outside leaves together. 
Then put back into a pot of fresh, boiling water, and cook 
until tender, and serve with melted butter poured over it. 



Cold Slaw. 

Take vinegar and water in equal proportions (unless the 
vinegar is very strong) ; add butter, the size of an egg, and a 
little flour. Pour into a saucepan over the fire, and stir until 
it is thick ; then pour in the beaten yolks of two eggs, and 
some salt. When it has been on the fire ten minutes more, 
stir in the cabbage, nicely shreded with a cabbage-cutter. The 
cabbage must be taken up, as soon as it is hot. . . 

You may add a saltspoonful of mustard to the sauce, if 
you like it. Salt the cabbage. 



Warm Slaw. 

Make a sauce of beaten yolk of egg, a teacup of vinegar, a 
teacup of sour cream, and butter the size of a walnut ; and 
when it begins to thicken, put in the cut cabbage, and stir 
until it is hot. Add salt and pepper, to the taste. 



Cold Slaio {very fine) . 

Take a plate of cut cabbage, a teacupful of chopped celery, 
and a third of a teacup of grated horseradish. Season with 



34 DIXIE COOKERY. 

salt. Make a dressing, as for lettuce, with the yolks of four 
eggs, "boiled hard, rubbed into a smootu* paste, with oil, mus- 
tard, salt, pepper, and vinegar, and the cabbage stirred into 
this cold mixture a few minutes before dinner. 



Cucumbers. 

Remove the rinds in long, thick slices. Cut them on a cab- 
bage-cutter in very thin slices, and lay them into cold water, 
— ice-water, if you can get it. Drain off the water, and lay 
into a dish, with small, thick lumps of ice through them, and 
strong vinegar poured over. Season with pepper and salt, 
before putting them into the dish. 



Celery. 

Scrape the outside, cut the root off, and split the head in 
halves. Wash well, wipe dry, and serve in a celery-glass. 
Leave on a few green leaves. 



Corn. 

Remove the silk, and drop into boiling water with a little 
salt in it, for half an hour. If it is old, it will take an hour. 
Lay a napkin on a dish, put in the corn, and fold the napkin 
over, to keep it hot. 

Cor n- Oysters. 

Cut the corn through the grain, and use a knife to scrape 
the pulp from the cob. Make a batter of 4wo eggs well beaten, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, a little salt, pepper, and some 
milk, with a quart of the pulp. Beat the whole well together, 
and drop a spoonful at a time into hot lard, and fry brown. 



Green-Corn Pudding. 

Pulp the corn in the same way, as for corn-oysters. Take 
two eggs, a quart of milk, some flour, and salt, and the corn, 



VEGETABLES.

and beat it well. It must be of a consistency to pour easily. 
Grease the dish with butter, pour in the pudding, and bake 
with a quick heat for half an hour. Six ears of corn will be 
sufficient for a quart of milk. 



Beets. 

They are usually plain boiled, and dressed with melted 
butter and vinegar, pepper and salt. But they are sweeter, 
roasted in the fire as potatoes, or baked in an oven or stove, 
and then dressed as above. 



Egg Plant. 

Cut in slices half an inch thick, sprinkle thick with salt, 
and let them stand a few minutes to extract the bitter taste. 
Wash in cold w^ter ; wipe them dry. Season with pepper. 
Dip in flour, and fry in butter, or dip in yolk of egg and 
grated cracker. 

When wanted for breakfast, some persons cut them the 
night before and sprinkle with salt, and soak in the morning 
in fresh water for an hour before frying. 



. Baked Egg Plant. 

Parboil them ten minutes ; cut them 'in halves, ana remove the 
seeds ; fill with a stuffing of bread-crumbs, butter, pepper, salt, 
the yolk of an egg ; close them, and tie a string around each 
one. Put a little water in the oven, or pan, and cook them 
slowly for half an hour, basting them with butter. Serve with- 
out gravy. 



Hominy. 

Soak it over night and boil for three or four hours, if large 
hominy ; and if small it will cook in an hour. Dress with 
butter and salt. 



36 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Onions. 

Boil in water until nearly done, and then pour over fresh hot 
water with milk in it. Drain, and pour over melted butter. 



Salsify or Oyster Plant. 

Scrape the roots in milk to prevent discoloring, and make a 
batter, by adding two eggs, salt, and butter, and flour enough 
to make a thick batter, and fry in hot lard. Serve on a hot 
water dish. 

Lettuce. 

Make a dressing of oil, mustard, pepper, salt, vinegar, and 
yolk of eggs boiled hard and mashed up, and made into a 
smooth paste with the other ingredients. The proportions of 
each so that the taste of no condiment shall predominate. Put 
this mixture in the bottom of your salad bowl, and lay the 
lettuce, nicely arranged, upon it. When you serve at table, 
cut up the salad, and mix with a box-wood spoon and fork 
with the dressing, before helping it. 



Ochra. 






Boil the young pods in water until tender, and dress with 
melted butter, vinegar, pepper, and salt. 

If you wish them for winter use, slice them very thin, and 
dry on dishes in the sun, and put away in paper bags. 



Boiled Irish Potatoes* 

If they are young, put them in a bucket of cold water, scrape 
off the skins, wash them, and drop into boiling water. When 
soft, dress with cream and melted butter. 

If you wish to have them mashed, pare them, and put into 
plenty of boiling water until half done. Then renew the boiling 
by pouring over fresh hot water, and when barely done, pour off 
the water, and let them steam ten minutes, when they must be

mashed, and dressed with butter and salt, and served in a hot 
water dish. Or you may put the potatoes in a steamer over 
boiling water, and boil till tender ; press one by one in a nap- 
kin to remove all the moisture, and lay on a hot water dish 
with a lid, and serve. 



Stewed Irish Potatoes. 

Slice thin, and boil in water till tender ; pour off the water 
and put in some butter, salt, pepper, and rich cream and a dust 
of flour. Before taking up, stir in the beaten yolk of an egg, 
with some chopped parsley. It is a nice breakfast dish. 



Fried Irish Potatoes. 

Cut cold potatoes in thin slices ; drop into boiling fat until 
of a nice brown ; take up with a perforated ladle. Sprinkle a 
little fine salt over them, and serve very hot. 



Sweet Potatoes. 

Bake them slowly in an oven, or peel them, and slice in 
large slices and put into a baking dish, with plenty of butter, 
a little water, and some sugar, and serve in the dish in which 
they are cooked. There must be plenty of butter on them 
when sent to table. 



To stew Tomatoes. 

Wash, and pour boiling water over them ; peel off the skins, 
and cut them up. Season with pepper and salt and butter, 
and cook in their own juice a half an hour. Thicken with 
bre#l-crunibs, and, after ten minutes, take them up. 



To put up Tomatoes for Winter.

Let the can also stand on the back part of the stove, whilst it 
is being filled. When fall, put on me lid, and a heavy weight 
on it, and let it remain until the wax in the groove of the can 
is cold. 

JSpinach. 

Boil it in salt and water, pour over melted butter and vine- 
gar, and sprinkle on some pepper, and serve with poached 
eggs, laid over the top of the spinach. 

Poke sprouts, when two or three inches above the ground, 
are nice, tied in bundles as asparagus, and, after standing in 
boiling water for a few minutes, dressed in the same way as 
spinach. Serve it without eggs. 



Green Peas. 

Shell them, and drop into boiling water for half an hour. 
If not verjr young, a little soda, the size of a pea, will improve 
the color, and make them tender. Dress them with butter, 
salt, and pepper. 

Cauliflowers, etc. 

Take equal quantities of milk and water, and when it boils, 
put in the cauliflowers, and boil till tender. Pour drawn but- 
ter over them, and send to table hot. Broccoli is cooked in 
the same way. 

Squashes. 

Cut them up, and remove the seeds, and cook in hot water 
until tender. Then mash them, and dress with butter, salt, 
and pepper. 

They are nice, cut in thick slices, and fried as egg-plant* 



Winter Squash. 

Cut the end off, and take out the seeds, and set it into the 
stove to bake until tender. Then take it out, put in plenty

of butter, and stir through the squash, and return to the oven 
for ten minutes. Send to the table in the skin in which it is 
baked. 

Parsnips. 

Scrape and split them, and put into a pot of boiling water, 
until tender. Dress with plenty of butter, salt, and pepper. 
Or 3 r ou may parboil them, and dip into beaten egg and grated 
cracker, and fry in hot lard. 



Turnips. 

They are dressed like parsnips. But a nicer way is to 
grate the raw turnips, and stir into a sauce of egg, vinegar, 
butter, and flour, and when it has boiled till of the consistency 
of cream, put in the turnips, give it another stir or two, and 
take up at once. This is called turnip-slaw. 



To boil Rice. 

Pick and wash a teacupful of rice, and put into a rice- 
kettle, with a pint of cold water ; cover close, and let it steam 
a few minutes after it is tender, so that every grain will stand 
alone. It will cook in twenty minutes over a bright fire. 



To cook Macaroni. 

Put the macaroni into a pot of boiling water, with a little 
salt in it, and let it cook ten minutes. Then pour on fresh 
hot water and milk in equal quantities, and boil ten minutes 
more. Then put it into a deep dish, with alternate layers of 
butter and grated cheese, until the dish is full, having maca- 
roni on the top, with a little butter on it without cheese. 

Bake in an oven or stove for half an hour.

PICKLES AND CATCHUPS. 

Mustard Pickles. 

Take two large boxes of mustard, and rub into it one-third 
of a pint of salad-oil and a little vinegar, until a smooth paste 
is made. Add to this half an ounce of ground cinnamon, 
and the same quantity of white pepper, cayenne pepper, grated 
horseradish, and white ginger and celery seed. Put in two 
teacupfuls of brown sugar, and then put all these ingredients 
into a stone jar two-thirds full of vinegar. Set the jar into a 
vessel of cold water over the fire, and boil for two or three 
hours, stirring occasionally. After it comes from the fire, put 
in white mustard-seed, and a little turmeric. The color will 
be finer if the cinnamon is omitted. Fill the jar with white 
cabbage-heads cut up fine, tender beans, or corn, small onions, 
and sliced cucumbers. 

This pickle will keep for a year or two, and as the vegeta- 
bles are used, more can be put in. If you wish the cabbage- 
heads in quarters, you must first scald them in brine until they 
are half done, and then put them on dishes for a day, and 
squeeze out the moisture in a napkin before putting in the vin- 
egar. 

Carolina Yellow Pickle. 

Six ounces of turmeric tied in a bag, six ounces of white 
pepper, three ounces of white mustard-seed, one ounce and a 
half of white pepper. Put these ingredients into vinegar, and 
let it stand two weeks before the cabbage is put in. 

Quarter the heads of cabbage, sprinkle with salt, and let 
them stand twenty-four hours. Then scald in the same salt 
and water which has formed a pickle around them, and after, 
wiping dry, put into the vinegar. 

Virginia Yellow Pickle. 

Two and a half gallons of good vinegar, seven pounds of 
brown sugar, one pound of white mustard-seed, one of ginger, 
one half pound of white pepper, one quarter of a pound of tur- 




PICKLES AND CATCHUPS. 41 

meric,'one bos of mustard, and two ounces of nutmeg, mace, 
celery-seed, allspice, and grated horseradish. Mix the tur- 
meric with a small portion of vinegar, as you do mustard, and 
add to the spiced vinegar, or tie it up in a thin bag. Slice and 
scald two dozen large onions ; sprinkle them with salt, let 
them stand a day, then drain well, say for six hours, and wash 
them in vinegar, and throw into the jar of spiced vinegar with 
half a dozen lemons or limes sliced thin. Select firm heads 
of cabbage, split them in halves, or quarter them, scald them 
in brine that will bear an egg until they are half done, drain 
them, and squeeze the moisture out with a napkin, and lay in 
the sun for one day. Put them in plain vinegar for a fortnight, 
after which they must be drained and sunned another day, be- 
fore they go into the spiced vinegar. This vinegar may be 
prepared at any season, and the cabbage added when you 
choose. One jar of vinegar will make three of pickled cab- 
bage. The spices must all be pounded (but not finely) before 
putting into the vinegar. It will be ready for use in a week. 
Keep the jar covered tightly. 



Mango Pickles. 

Put them in salt and water three or four days, then cut a 
slit from one end to the other, and take out all the seeds, and 
wipe dry with a towel. *Then soak the melons over night in 
lukewarm water. The next day put them in a bright brass 
kettle, with warm water enough to cover them, and a piece of 
alum, and simmer gently for three hours. Let them cool, and 
put them into warm water again to simmer, until they are fresh 
enough. Then soak a day and night in warm vinegar. Make 
a stuffing of sliced cucumbers, onions, horseradish grated, 
celery-seed, mustard-seed (white and black), green pepper, 
cut fine, and a little oil. Mix all well in a bowl, and put in 
the melons. Tie them up and put them into a stone jar, and 
pour boiling vinegar over them. Add two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, and pour a little oil over the top, and seal up, and they 
are good for years. 

Bell Pepper P icicles. 

Gather, wipe dry with a towel, cut a slit in the pepper, and 
insert a teaspoonful of salt, and drop into cold vinegar.

Peach Mangoes. 

Take fresh, unbruised clingstones, and throw them into salt 
and water twenty-four hours. Remove the stones with a fruit- 
knife, and put them into cold vinegar and water in equal 
parts. Make a stuffing of grated horseradish, white mustard- 
seed,, mace, cloves, allspice, pepper, nutmeg, and a very little 
minced onion, with brown sugar enough to make the stuffing 
rich. Fill the cavities, plug the holes, tie a thread around 
them, and drop the peaches into cold vinegar. Some persons 
use free-stone peaches, and put a little turmeric in the stuffing. 



Small Cucumbers. 

Gather them from two to four inches long, and drop into 
strong vinegar, with mustard-seed, pepper, and celery-seed, in 
it. Tie them close. Martinas are pickled in the same way. 



Cucumbers. 

Make a strong salt and water, and* let the cucumbers lie in 
it for two weeks. Then soak all night in fresh water. The 
next day put them into a bright brass kettle, with a little 
alum, and water enough to cover them. Put grape-leaves on 
top, and a plate to keep in the steam. Simmer gently for a 
half a day. Let them get entirely cold, and then put them 
into fresh alum water, over the fire, and continue doing this, 
until they are quite fresh. Then, if they are a fine green, put 
them into a jar, and boil some vinegar and spices in a porce- 
lain kettle, and pour over them. Have plenty of vinegar to 
cover the pickles, and cork them up tightly. 



Clierry Pickles. 

Wash the cherries, leaving the stems on. Put them into a 
jar, with alternate layers of sugar, cloves, and cinnamon, and 
pour cold vinegar over them. 



PICKLES AND CATCHUPS. 43 



Cabbage Pickle, 

Cut up the cabbage on a cabbage-cutter, sprinkle with salt, 
let it stand twelve hours, drain it, and press out any moisture 
that remains. Put it into a jar, with layers of white mustard- 
seed between, and fill with cold vinegar. 



Nasturtiums. 

Drop them into a jar of strong vinegar, as you gather them, 
and tie up the jar close. 

Onions. 

Peel small white onions, pour boiling milk and water over 
them, and when cold, put them into a jar with white mustard- 
seed and horseradish, and pour boiling vinegar over them. 



Ripe Tomatoes. 

Take small, round tomatoes, and prick them with a needle, 
and let them lie a week in salt and water. Then wash them 
well, and drain them for ten hours. Put into ajar, with white 
pepper sprinkled over, some mustard-seed, and one or two 
pods of red pepper sliced. Pour strong, cold vinegar over 
them, and they will be ready for use in a few days. Keep 
them covered close. 



Green Tomatoes. 

Slice thin on a cabbage-cutter, sprinkle with salt, and let 
them stand six hours. Drain off the water, and press out the 
remaining moisture. Cut, salt, and drain some onions in the 
same way, and put into the jar alternate layers of tomatoes, 
onions, sliced green peppers, spices, and a little brown sugar, 
in the proportion of a teacupful to every gallon of tomatoes. 
Pour cold vinegar over them. About one-fourth of the pickle 
.should be onions. 



44 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Tomato^ Mangoes. 



Cut a small piece, the size of a saltspoon bowl, from the 
top, and, with a small teaspoon, remove the seeds. Sprinkle 
salt in them, and let them lie thus for a &&y and night. *Tken 
soak them in lukewarm water, with alum in it, until green and 
fresh enough to stuff. Make a stuffing, as for other mangoes, 
and fill and tie them up, and pour cold vinegar over them. 
They will be ready for use much sooner, by putting them into 
vinegar for twenty-four hours before stuffing them. They are 
very nice. Bell peppers are made in the same way. 



Walnut Pickles, Black. 

Gather the walnuts, whilst soft enough to run a pin through 
them ; put them into an iron pot, and boil in water until the 
hull comes off easily. Put into a tub of cold water ; hull them, 
and wash them, and put them into jars. Pour moderately 
strong salt and water over them, and let them remain in this 
a week, changing the brine once during this time. At the end 
of this time, scald them in weak vinegar, and let them stand 
in this four clays ; then pour it off, and, to a peck of hulled 
walnuts, take a quarter of a pound of cloves, a teacup of mus- 
tard-seed, two spoonfuls of black pepper, a pint of grated 
horseradish, two pods of red pepper, some sliced onions, and 
garlic, and put in with the walnuts, and pour over them cold 



White Walnuts. 

Take them when so soft a pin will run through easily. Boil 
a pickle of salt and water that will bear an egg, skim it, and 
when it is cold, pour over the walnuts. Let them stand in this 
brine fourteen clays, and then throw them into cold water for two 
clays. Boil them in weak vinegar, and let them lie in this a 
week. Simmer enough of strong vinegar to cover them. 
Mix together grated horseradish, cloves, mustard-seecl, and 
red pepper. Put the walnuts into the jar in alternate layers 
with the condiments, and pour the scalded vinegar over them. 



PICKLES AND CATCHUPS. 45 



Sweet Piclde Peaches {excellent?) . 

Pare the pickles and cut them in halves, and to two pounds 
of fruit, take # one quart of vinegar, and one pound of sugar. 
Put the sugar and vinegar over the fire, skim it, and when it 
has simmered fifteen minutes, put on the peaches, and let them 
remain until they are slightly cooked, but not soft. Boil cin- 
namon and mace in the syrup. Cloves are nice, but discoloi 
the fruit. 

Spiced Peaches. 

Take nine pounds of clingstone peaches, ripe, but not soft, 
pare and halve them, or leave them whole. Make a syrup of 
four pounds of brown sugar and a pint of good vinegar, some 
mace and cinnamon, and skim it well. Let it cook a quarter 
of an hour, and then throw in the peaches, a few at a time, so 
as to keep them as whole as possible, and when clear, take 
them out and lay on dishes, and put in more ; when all are 
done, pour the syrup over the peaches. 



Sauce of Cherries or Damsons, for Meats. 

Allow half a pound of brown sugar to every pound of fruit, 
and to every seven pounds of fruit a pint of strong vinegar. 
Put all in together, and let them cook slowly until they are 
done. Then take the fruit from the syrup and put on dishes. 
Let the syrup boil longer until it is rich, adding cloves and 
four sticks of cinnamon. Pour over the fruit in jars, whilst 
hot. 

Watermelon Sweet Pickles. 

Two pounds of watermelon or muskmelon rinds boiled in 
pure water until tender. Drain them well. Then make a 
syrup of two pounds of sugar, one quart of vinegar, half an 
ounce of mace, an ounce of cinnamon, and some roots of gin- 
ger boiled until thick, and pour over the melons boiling hot. 
Drain off the syrup, heat it until boiling hot, and pour over 
the melons three days in succession. They are very nice, and 
will keep two years. 



DIXIE COOKERY. 



White Walnut Catchup. 

Gather the walnuts when soft enough to run a pin through, 
put them in salt and water for ten days ; then pound them in 
a mortar or pot, and to every dozen walnuts put a quart of 
strong vinegar and stir it occasionally. Then strain it through 
a bag, and to every quart of liquor put a teaspoonful of pounded 
mace, the same of cloves, and a few slices of onion. Boil it half 
an hour, and when cold, bottle it. If you use black walnuts, 
remove the hulls in the same way as for pickles. 



Cucumber Catchup. 

Pare and cut the cucumbers into very small square slices, 
the size of a grain of corn, and add onions cut in the same 
way, in the proportion of one onion to every half dozen cu- 
cumbers. Mix them and salt them well, and let them stand 
ten or twelve hours. Then drain them well through a sieve 
or colander. Season with white or black pepper to your taste,' 
and put in alternate layers of the fruit and white mustard- 
seed, until your jars are three-fourths full. The jars must be 
small, as this catchup spoils by exposure to the air. Fill the 
jars entirely to the top with vinegar. The vinegar must be 
the very best cider vinegar. White wine dissolves the fruit. 
Some ^ persons prefer the catchup with wine in it. Madeira 
wine is the best, in the proportion of a pint to every gallon 
of vinegar. Seal up the jars well, and every few days ex- 
amine them. When you see the cucumbers rising above the 
Vinegar, open the jar and press them down, and fill up with 
vinegar, and seal tightly again. Keep them in a cool place 
during the warm weather. 



Tomato Catchup. 

Take a peck of ripe tomatoes, wash and cut them in pieces, 
and put in a porcelain kettle, and boil until they are quite soft. 
Then mash them well and strain through a hair sieve. Season 
with salt and cayenne pepper, and white mustard-seed, and let 
it boil till half of it is boiled away. Let the bottles in which 
you intend to pour it be set on the back part of the stove and 



i BREAD, PASTRY, PUDDINGS, ETC. 47 

gradually heated, and pour the catchup into the bottles when 
Quite not, but not boiliug. Cork and seal well, and keep in a 
cool place, until the warm weather is over. You may add 
powdered cloves and black pepper, if you like them, but they 
will discolor the tomato juice. 



BREAD, PASTEY, PUDDINGS, Etc. 

Very fine Yeast. 

Boil five or six pared potatoes ; when soft, mash them in the 
boiling water over the fire, put in a half a teacupful of dried 
hops, and let them boil ten minutes (not longer), and then 
strain through a colander. Put in a little salt and stir it well ; 
thin it with milk-warm water until of the consistency of thin 
waffle batter. When lukewarm, stir in a teacupful of liquid 
yeast. Set it near the back part of the stove, or in a tolerably 
warm place, to rise, and in twelve 'or fourteen hours it will be 
light. If not, put in a little more yeast. If the weather is 
warm, it will not require to be placed near the stove. If you 
wish dry yeast, rub it in sifted corn meal until it is a dry 
dough, and spread thin on dishes or waiters, to dry in the air, 
but not in the sun. In winter it can be set near the back part 
of the stove, but not in too warm a place, or it will not rise. 
If you wish liquid yeast, pour it into a stone jug, and cork 
tightly. When 3^011 strain the hop-water over the flour, set 
your bucket containing the flour beside the stove or fire, with 
the colander over it, and let the pot containing the hop-water 
and potatoes remain over the fire, whilst you are dipping out 
the water and hops and potatoes, so that the flour will be well 
scalded. A small quantity of hops is used, because more 
would darken the yeast and bread, as well as spoil the sweet- 
ness of the bread. If your yeast should get a little sour, add 
a very little soda to it before putting it into the bread. 



Potato Rolls. 

Mash a pint of Irish potatoes very smoothly, and put in a 
quarter of a pound of butter whilst they are warm, and a little

salt. Add half a teacup of yeast, and half a teacup of milk, 
with a pint of flour. Make these ingredients into a dough, 
and set them to rise. In three or four hours they will be 
ready to make into rolls, and after being set to rise a second 
time, bake when light in a quick oven or stove. 



Bolls and Bread (superior). 

Sift three quarts of flour. Take two eggs, one teacupful 
and a half of liquid yeast, two pints of lukewarm water, one 
tablespoonful of brown sugar, one of salt, and four handfuls 
of flour taken from the measured flour. Beat the eggs very 
light, and make these ingredients into a smooth batter. After 
the batter is well beaten, divide the remaining flour into two 
equal parts, and put one part of the flour into a tin pan or 
bucket, pour in the batter, and cover the batter with the re- 
mainder of the flour. Set it in a moderately warm place, and 
in an hcur and a half, or when light, turn the whole out and 
work it well. It may require more flour in kneading it. Work 
it quickly, but not until it is cold, and set it to rise again, 
rubbing a little lard over the top of the dough. In three or 
four hours it will be ready to knead over again, and after it 
has risen a second time, it is ready for baking in a quick 
oven. 

If you wish rolls, work in a spoonful of lard during the last 
kneading, and mould the dough into small cakes. Do not 
keep the dough too warm, and it will be more flaky. 

If you wish a smaller loaf of bread, use only a pint and a 
half of water in making up the batter, but do not diminish 
the other ingredients. 



Milk Biscuit 

Take one pound of flour, one quarter of a pound of butter, 
eight tablespoonfuls of yeast, and one half a pint of new 
milk. Melt the butter in the milk, put in the yeast and some 
salt, and work into the stiff paste. When light, knead it well, 
roll it out an inch thick, cut out with a tumbler, prick them 
with a fork, and bake in a quick oven. 

If butter is not abundant, you may take an eighth of a 
pound of lard, and the other butter.

dough well. Roll it out, and cut into cakes with a tumbler. 



Flour Muffins. 

Take one pint of milk, four eggs, a teacup of home-made 
yeast, a few grated bread-crumbs, and one quart of flour. 
Beat them into a smooth batter, and let them stand three or 
four hours to rise. Bake them in rings which must be well 
buttered, and split and butter before sending to table. 



Rice and Flour Muffins. 

Half a teacup of flour, a teacup of bursted rice, a pint and 
a half of milk, and three eggs. The batter must be as thin 
as for pancakes. Bake with a quick heat. 



Egg Muffins. 

Four eggs beaten light, a pint and a half of milk, and'a

rise in a wooden bowl. When it begins to open on top, grease 
the oven, and put it to bake. Bake slowly for some hours, 
until well browned. 



Corn Meal or Flour Crisp. 

* One pint of meal or flour mixed with warm water and a lit- 
tle salt, and a small piece of .lard. Make these ingredients

lard the size of a guinea egg, melted and put in the batter. 
Beat well for fifteen minutes. Grease the waffle irons, fill 
them with batter, and bake on a bed of bright coals, turning 
the irons so that both sides will be browned. Butter as you 
remove from the irons. If you have no sweet milk, it will do 
to make them entirely with buttermilk.

Corn-Meal Batter Cakes. 

Pour boiling milk over sifted corn-meal, and beat until luke- 
warm. Then add a little salt, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and 
three eggs well beaten. Bake on a griddle. The milk and 
meal must be in such proportion as will make a thin batter, 
say a pint of meal to a quart of boiling milk. 



Corn-Meal Wafers. 

Take a little salt and equal portions of corn meal and flour, 
and mix with water or milk into a stiff dough. Put the lump 
of dough into a pan, with sweet milk enough to cover it, and 
work the dough in the milk until it becomes as thick as very 
thick cream. Bake in wafer irons. They bake very quickly. 



Plain Wafers. 

Take sifted flour and meal in equal quantities, with milk, 
ancWbeat into a smooth and very thin batter of the consistency 
of cream. Add a little salt, and bake in wafer irons until of 
a fine brown. They are a nice tea-wafer.

ing pan. Serve very hot for breakfast. 



BREAD, PASTRY, PUDDINGS, ETC. 55 



Butter Toast. 

Have the slices of bread toasted a light straw color, and 
pour melted butter over it, ai^d serve on a hot water-dish. If 
the toast is desired less rich, put a few spoonfuls of water in 
the butter. 

Busk. 

Beat three eggs separately until they are light. Take a 
quarter of a pound of sugar, the same quantity of lard, half 
a pint of new milk, and eight tablespoonfuls of yeast. Melt 
the lard in the milk, stir in the sugar, and when lukewarm, 
add the yeast, and as much flour as will make a stiff batter ; 
put in the eggs and set to rise. When light, add more flour, 
and work them well, but don't have them too stiff. Set to rise 
again, and bake when light in a quick oven. 



Puff Paste. 

Sift a pound of flour, and take out a quarter of a pound for 
rolling. Divide a pound of butter or three quarters of a pound 
of lard into four equal parts. Put one part of the shortening 
into the flour, and with a little water, make it into a stiff 
dough. Roll it out, and flake it with part of the shortening. 
Fold over the sheet of paste, roll it out again, and spread over 
another portion of butter or lard. Roll and fold thus three 
times. Handle it as little as possible, and put in a cold place 
until ready for use. This quantity is sufficient for four pies. 
This paste must be baked with a quick heat, say for ten or 
fifteen minutes. Or you may take two pounds and a half of 
flour, two pounds of butter, one pint of water, with two eggs 
broken in the water. 

Mince Pies. 

Boil four pounds of lean beef and chop it fine. Pick and 
chop three pounds of suet, wash two pounds of currants, and 
one of raisins, grate the peel of two lemons and add the juice, 
an ounce of sliced citron, and twelve large apples chopped 
fine. Mix these ingredients with three pounds of sugar, half 



56 DIXIE COOKERY. 

a pint of wine, and the same of brandy, and a little sweet 
cider, and nutmeg and mace to your taste. Bake this mince- 
meat in puff paste, with a lid of paste on top. 



Mince Pies without Meat. 

Take four pounds of suet, eight pounds of apples, four nut- 
megs, eight pounds of raisins, four pounds of sugar, half a- 
pound of sliced citron, two quarts of wine, two quarts of bran- 
dy, half an ounce of cloves, the same of mace, an ounce 
of cinnamon, a tablespoonful of salt, and four large oranges. 
If it gets too dry, add more brandy. It will keep from No- 
vember till May. 

Rhubarb Pie. 

Peel the young stalks, cut them in small pieces, and stew 
till very soft, with a very little water. Mash it into a marma- 
lade, sweeten with sugar, and set away to cool. Bake a lower 
crust and fill with the stewed rhubarb. They are not nice 
after the first day. 



Apple and Peach Pie. 

If made of early green apples, they must be stewed with a 
little water, sweetened with sugar, and nutmeg grated over 
the top. Bake without a lid of paste. 

Winter apples are pared, cored, sliced thin, and put into a 
dish lined with paste, with the juice and grated rind of a 
lemon, and a little sugar, and very little water. Bake with a 
cover of paste. Peaches are pared and sliced, sugareu, and 
put into a pie-plate lined with crust, with a tablespoonful of 
water. Cover with paste. 



Apple Pies without Apples {very good) .

crumbs, one egg beaten light, and one teaspoonful of tartaric 
acid. Soak the bread-crumbs in the warm water and rub them 
smooth, and put in the other ingredients, and season with 



BREAD, PASTRY, PUDDINGS, ETC. 57 

lemon or nutmeg to jouy taste, and bake with a crost above, 
as an apple-pie. 



jSiveet Potato Pie. 

Boil the potatoes, skin and slice them, and put into a deep 
dish with a few sliced apples. Fill the dish with apples and 
potatoes, and pour over some wine, sugar, butter, nutmeg, and 
a little water. Bake with a crust. 



Icing for Pies. 

Just before they are quite done, wash over the top of the pie 
with the beaten white of an egg on a feather, and sift white 
sugar finely powdered over the egg. Or use only plain water, 
and sift over white sugar. Or you may beat up the yolk of an 
egg, and put a piece of butter the size of a walnut (melted) 
into it, and wash over the tops of the pies with it, sifting white 
sugar powdered over it. 



Apple Meringues. 

Fill a small, deep dish half full of stewed apples, or any 
preserved acid fruit (peaches are very nice) , and pour over 
an icing of the beaten whites of six eggs, and six tablespoon- 
fuls of white sugar. Bake slowly in an oven from one to two 
hours. It can be eaten cold or hot. If the apple is stewed, 
only let it remain in the oven long enough to cook and brown 
the icing nicely. 

Stewed and Baked Apples. 

Pare and core some firm acid apples. Stick cloves in them ; 
fill the vacancy left by the core with sugar, and some thin 
strips of lemon-peel, if you have them, and put into a baking- 
pan, with just water enough to keep them from burning. Bake 
them until they are tender, but not until they break. When 
they are cold, eat them with whipped cream heaped over them 
for dinner, or plain cream for tea. 



58 DIXIE COOKERY. 

To stew apples, pare and core them, and leave them whole. 
Make a syrup of loaf-sugar and wMer, boil and skim it ; and 
when it has boiled twenty minutes, drop in the apples and 
some slices of lemon, carefully removing the lemon-seed, or 
some strips of lemon-peel cut thin. If the apples are not 
very firm, you can take them up on dishes to cool, after they 
have been in the syrup a few minutes, and then return them to 
the syrup, and cook until tender. They are very nice, and 
may be prepared the day before they are to be served. 



An Apple Charlotte. 

Take slices of light bread, and dip them in bailing milk, and 
lay them in the bottom of your baking-dish. Pare and chop 
your apples into fine pieces. Then put in alternate layers of 
apples and batter, sugar and spices, until the dish is full. Put 
bread-crumbs, goaked in boiling milk, over the top, and bake 
from three to four hours, until it is a perfect jelly. 

It is usually served hot for dinner, but may be eaten cold. 



Apple Float. 

Take a quart of stewed apples, mash them fine, and press 
them through a sieve, and season with loaf-sugar and flour, 
with lemon. Stir into the apples the well-beaten whites of four 
eggs, and pile up the apple thus prepared on a glass bowl half 
filled with rich cream and milk. Serve in saucers. 



Floating Island.

cut in halves, squeeze the juice of a lemon over all, and pile 
whipped cream up handsomely on the top. 



Charlotte Busse. 

One pint of milk, twelve eggs, half a pound of sugar, a 
pint of rich cream, and one pint of jelly. Make a custard of 
the milk, eggs, sugar, and flour, with lemon or vanilla. Dis- 
solve the jelly and add it to the custard, and stir the whole 
until it is cold, and about as thick as the thickest molasses. 
Then beat in the cream, which has been previously whipped, 
and pour into moulds lined with sponge-cake. If the weather 
is warm, set it on ice, and let it remain nearly an hour, and 
turn out on a china dish. Ice the whole with icing, prepared 
as for cake, and when it is dry, put some icing in a paper horn 
and run over it in fanciful forms. Set it in a refrigerator un- 
til wanted. Omit the icing if you choose. Instead of a mould, 
you may take a large, round sponge-cake, turn it bottom up- 
wards, and cut off a slice an inch thick. Then remove the 
whole of the inside, leaving the shell of the cake an inch thick. 
Pour the mixture in this, put on the bottom slice, and set on 
ice. 

Flummery. 

Half an hour before dinner, lay some slices of sponge-cake 
or macaroons in the bottom of a glass bowl, and pour over 
them some white wine until they are quite moist ; make a rich 
custard, and when cool, pour over the cake. Whisk the whites 
to a stiff froth, and pile up on the custard. Serve in saucers. 



Blanc Mange. 

Blanch and pound one pound of almonds, and put them, with 
an ounce of isinglass and a little sugar, into a quart of milk. 
"When it boils, add a quart of cream, and boil all together, and 
strain through a muslin cloth. When strained, season with 
orange-flower or rose-water ; let it stand a little, and pour into 
the mould. The mould must have been previously scalded, 
and set in cold water until ready for the blanc mange. The 



60 DIXIE COOKERY. 

shred isinglass is best, because it does not require dissolving 
beforehand. The almonds are weighed in the shell. 



Arrowroot Blanc Mange. 






Take one quart of milk, four tablespoonfuls of arrowroot, 
two of peach-water, for flavoring, and a quarter of a pound of 
sugar. Mix the arrowroot with a portion of the milk, and 
boil the remainder with the sugar. Then pour in the arrow- 
root mixed with the milk, and stir constantly until thick enough 
to pour into moulds, which should be wet with cream. Allow 
the arrowroot mixed with the milk to stand some time before 
stirring in the boiling milk, so that the specks will have time 
to rise and be removed. Serve out in saucers, and pour thick 
cream over. It can also be made with ground rice in the same 
proportions. 

Omelette Souffle. 

Take eight eggs, and beat the j^olks and whites separately 
light ; stir three-quarters of a pound of powdered sugar into 
the yolks and beat well, and stir in the whites and mix well.

saucers, and pour cream over it. Make it in a glass dish, and 
grate nutmeg over it. 



Boiled Custard (very fine). 

Take twelve eggs, one quart of milk, and twelve tablespoon- 
fuls of white sugar powdered. Beat half of the sugar with 
the yolks, and half with the whites. Boil cinnamon or lemon- 
paring in the milk, and make a custard with it, the yolks, and 
sugar. Fill saucers two-thirds full with the custard, putting 
a little preserved apple, or pine-apple marmalade, into the bot- 
tom of each saucer. Then wet a tablespoon in cold water, 
and lay the whites in spoonfuls on the custard, three spoon- 
fuls on each saucer, and bake with a hot lid until the top is 
slightly brown. The oven in which you set the saucers must 
be cold. 

Wine Custard. 

Beat eight eggs very light, leaving out the whites of three. 
Take half a pound of sugar, and a pint of wine, and beat 
with the eggs for a few minutes. Pour the mixture into a hot 
kettle, and stir constantly until it boils. Then pour the mix- 
ture out, and beat until cold. Flavor with lemon, and grate 
nutmeg over. Serve in glasses. The wine must be a light 
color, and the kettle not very hot. This quantity is sufficient 
for six persons. 



Plain Boiled Custard. 

Make a custard of six or eight yolks of eggs, to a quart of 
milk ; sweeten with sugar to the taste, and flavor with vanilla 
or lemon. Boil the milk and flavoring together, take off the 
fire, and stir in the yolks and sugar ; then stir constantly, and 
let it simmer, but not boil, until it thickens, when remove 
from the fire. Serve with the whites of eggs beaten, and laid 
on top of the bowl or cups, and nutmeg grated on them. 

Or } r ou may mix the yolks of eggs, sugar, and flavoring to- 
gether, and pour them into a pitcher, and set it into a kettle 
or pot of boiling water, and stir till it is cooked. It will not 
be so apt to curdle, made in this way. 



62 DIXIE COOKERY. 

If you like raisins, stone and cut a teacupful, and boil in 
the milk instead of the flavoring. 



Strawberry Whips. 

Put three wineglassfuls of the juice to ten ounces of white

Beat all well together, and pour into a buttered mould or dish, 
and bake slowly for two hours. 

Make a sauce of three beaten eggs, a little sugar, and a gill 
of milk seasoned with lemon. Stir over the lire until it be- 
comes as thick as thin cream, but do not let it boil, and add 
two wineglasses of brandy. Serve in a sauce-boat. 

This pudding may be boiled. If you boil in a cloth, scald 
and flour the pudding-cloth and form the shape by laying it into 
a round-bottomed bowl whilst the mixture is being put in ; 
leave room for it to swell, and tie up very tightly. Drop into 
boiling water, of which there must be enough to cover the 
pudding well, and replenish from the teakettle as it evaporates. 
Turn the pudding frequently. When the pudding is done, it 
should be dipped into a pan of cold water, to prevent it adher- 
ing to the cloth.

and fry it in boiling lard. The more lard there is, the less 
they will soak it up, and it must be hot or they will not be 
light. Sift powdered sugar over them while they are hot. 



Golden Cakes. 

Beat the yolks of four eggs well, and pour in some sifted 
flour and beat well. Then work flour enough into it to make 
a very stiff dough. Put a little salt in the flour. Roll out the 
dough into very thin sheets, — as thin as a knife-blade, — and 
cut in diamond shapes with a notched wheel, and fry in hot 
lard. Sprinkle over powdered sugar whilst hot. The whites 
of the eggs made up and baked in the same way make an 
equally nice cake. 

To make Kisses. 

Beat the whites of eight eggs to a stiff froth, and mix in a 
pound of sifted white sugar, a little at a time. Beat well, 
flavor with lemon, drop on white paper buttered, and bake 
with a slow heat, but not too ceol an oven, or they will run 
together. Stick two together when they are done. 



Boiled Icing for Cake. 

Take the best refined loaf-sugar, break it into small lumps, 
and pour over it some cold water, taking care to use no more 
than will be just sufficient to dissolve it. Mash the lumps 
with the back of a spoon, and set over the fire and boil with- 
out stirring until the syrup is the consistency of honey. In 



CAKES. 89 

the meantime beat to a stiff froth the whites of three eggs, 
allowing this number of eggs to every pound of sugar. Strain 
the boiled syrup into a bowl immediately upon removing it 
from the fire, and in a few minutes stir in gradually the beaten 
whites of eggs, and some lemon-juice or essence. Beat it 
until very smooth and light, and put in a few drops of indigo 
squeezed through a muslin bag, to make it a pearly white. If 
the icing is too thin, set the bowl in an oven of boiling water, 
over a few bright coals, and stir it whilst it boils, taking care 
it does not adhere to the side of the bowl. Or you may omit 
a portion of the whites of the eggs. If too thick from stand- 
ing, add some beaten white of egg, a small portion at a time, 
until of the proper consistency. Put on this icing while it is 
warm. 

Cold Icing for Cake. 

Roll, and sift well through a sieve and coarse muslin, a 
pound of loaf-sugar. Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth, and stir gradually into them the pulverized sugar. Beat 
it well and flavor with lemon. Or you may take the white of 
one egg to half a pound of sugar and a very little rose-water, 
and beat together until they stand.* Add a few drops of 
lemon-juice, or a little tartaric acid dissolved in very little 
water. Beat very well, and put on the cake in a thin coat. 
When this is dry put on a second coat, and as many more as 
will make the icing thick enough. 



Orange Icing for Orange-Drops. 

Make the orange-drops by dropping very stiff pound cake 
batter on tin plates. They should be about the size of a 
silver dollar. Prepare the icing by beating together orange- 
juice and pulverized sugar until quite stiff. When the 
orange-drops are baked a pale brown, and are cold, spread this 
icing over, and set in an oven to dry. Put on only one coat 
of icing. 

They are delicious, and look prettily in a basket of mixed 
cake. They will be much nicer if the pound-cake batter is 
flavored with the orange-juice and grated rind.

PKESEKVES AND JELLIES. 

Crab Apples. 






Put them into 3 7 our preserving-kettle, with cold water 
enough to cover them, and let them boil until the skin breaks. 
Then take them out one by one and skin them, and remove 
the seeds with a penknife. Make a syrup of a pint of water 
and a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit, and when it is 
clear, drop in the apples and let them boil until they are 
transparent. 

Pine-Apple Marmalade. 

Pare and grate the pine-apple, and take equal parts of fruit 
and sugar and put into your preserving-kettle, and cook 
slowly until it is clear. It is very nice and keeps well. 



^ Pine-Apples. 

Pare and slice the fruit. Make a syrup of a pound of 
sugar and half a pint of water to every pound of fruit, and 
when it is clarified and well skimmed, drop in the apples and 
let them simmer slowly for an hour. If you only wish to keep 
them for a short time, less sugar will do, and the flavor is 
finer. 

Apples. 

Pare and core the apples, and drop them into cold water. Or, 
after you have cored them, cut them across so that they will 
be in thick rings. Make a syrup of half a pound of sugar to 
every pound of fruit ; clarify it by mixing the white of an egg 
to every two pounds of sugar before it goes on the fire ; boil 
and skim it, and drop in the apples. Simmer slowly till the 
fruit is clear. Then take out the apples, and boil the syrup 
until it is rich, and pour over the fruit. If the apples are 
tart, allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound 
of fruit. If they are not very firm, take them up on dishes to 
cool after they have been in the syrup a few minutes, and 



PliESERVES AND JELLIES. 91 

when cold return them to the kettle. Add the peel of several 
lemons (cut in rings and boiled a few minutes in hot water) to 
the syrup after the fruit is taken out. 



To Preserve Green-Gage Plums. 

Weigh the fruit and put into the kettle with alternate layers 
of vine-leaves. Fill the kettle with cold water, and let them 
simmer until the skin begins to crack open. Then remove 
from the fire and pare them with a knife, leaving the stems on. 
Measure the parings, and for every pint deduct a pound from 
the weight of the fruit. Scald the fruit again after it has been 
pared. Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to every pound of 
fruit with a very little water, and when clarified, drop in the 
fruit and cook slowly until clear. Then remove from the 
syrup, and add another pound of sugar to the syrup, and boil 
for half an hour. 

If you do not wish to take off the skins, prick them with a 
pin. 

Cherries. 

Stone the fruit, and to every pound of fruit take a pound 
of sugar. Put the fruit in your kettle in alternate laj^ers with 
the sugar, and boil and skim until they are tender and the 
syrup is rich. Or you may take twelve pounds of Moulla 
cherries, and stone them, and dissolve four pounds of sugar 
with the juice from the fruit ; clarify it, and put in the fruit, 
and boil slowly until they are cooked. 



Apricots. 

Pour boiling water on the fruit, and wipe them dry. Then 
cut them in halves and stone them. Take equal parts of fruit 
and sugar, and, when the syrup has been boiled, put in the 
fruit and cook it slowly until it is clear and the syrup is rich. 



Green Lemons. 
Cut them in halves, take out the pulp, and cut in fancy 



92 DIXIE COOKERY. 

shapes,' Put into your preserving-kettle and cover with 
water, adding a little alum to green them. Boil until clear, 
and then take them out and drain them on a cloth. Clean the 
kettle, and put them in with their weight in sugar, and stew 
them slowly until the syrup is rich. 



Green Peppers. 






Leave the stems on them ; remove the seeds, and put them 
in salt and water for three clays, changing the water -every 
day. Then green them in a kettle with cold water, vine- 
leaves, and a little alum ; simmer thus for two hours. Then 
put them into fresh water for three days, changing the water 
every day. Then boil in a syrup of a pound of sugar to the 
same weight of pepper and a little water, for half an hour. 
Fill the inside with candied sugar. 



l o v 



Green Tomatoes {very fine). 

Take them while quite small and green, and put them into 
cold clarified S3>rup, with an orange cut in slices to every two 
pounds of tomatoes. (In making the syrup, take the weight 
of the fruit in sugar.) Simmer them gentl}' over a slow fire 
for two or three hours. Grate the rinds and add the juice of 
two fresh lemons to every three pounds of preserves, and put 
in some bruised ginger in bags. If you wish the preserves to 
be very superior, take the tomatoes from the syrup when they 
have been over the fire for three-quarters of an hour, and add 
a quarter of a pound more of sugar for every pound of fruit, 
and, when boiled and skimmed, drop in the tomatoes and boil 
till the syrup seems to have penetrated them. In about a 
week, heat the syrup boiling hot, and pour over them, and seal 
up immediately. They resemble limes, thus prepared. 



Water-Melon Rinds. 

Cut in strips and shapes, and remove the green skin, and 
boil in water till tender, with a teaspoonful of soda and a 
dozen peach-leaves to every two quarts of water. Then take 
out the rinds and soak them in alum-water an hour, and after- 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 93 

wards boil gently in strong ginger tea for an hour. Make a 
syrup of eqiwal weights of the sugar and rinds, and a little 
water, clarify it, and boil and skim it. Then put in the rinds 
with some ginger-root tied in a muslin bag, and when hot take 
them out on dishes to cool, and when cold return to the syrup 
and cook until soft. Pour the syrup over, and after a few 
days boil the syrup with the juice of a lemon, or flavor with 
essence of lemon, and pour over the rinds whilst it is hot. 
They are then ready to put into jars. 



Orange Marmalade. 

Put the rinds of the oranges into a kettle with cold water, 
and boil until soft enough to run the head of a pin into them 
easily. Then take them up on a plate, and with a penknife 
remove the white part of the rind so as to leave the yellow 
part of the rind as thin as possible. Quarter the oranges and 
pulp them, removing the seeds and core, and weigh them with 
the skins, and to every pound of the fruit allow a pound of 
loaf-sugar. Make a syrup of the sugar, and half a pint of 
water to every pound of it, and boil and clarify, and throw in 
the rinds, and when tender add the pulp, and boil all together 
for half an hour. 

Lemon marmalade is made in the same way, allowing a 
pound and a half of sugar to every pound of fruit. , 



A New and Excellent Way of preserving Peaches. 

Pare, halve, and weigh the peaches, put them into a preserv- 
ing-kettle full of boiling water, and to every six pounds of 
fruit put a teaspoonful of soda. Let them boil one minute, 
take them off, and throw them into cold water, and rem'ove any 
dark scum which may adhere to them. Make the syrup of 
half a pound of sugar and a gill of water to every pound of 
fruit. Boil and clarify it, and when well skimmed put in the 
fruit, and when half done take the peaches from the syrup and 
lay on dishes so that each piece shall be separate, and let 
them get entirely cold. Then return to the boiling syrup and 
cook until done. Boil the syrup until it is rich. This pre- 
serve will keep for twelve months. 

It is best to warm the jars and put in the preserves hot, but 



94 DIXIE COOKERY. 

if the jars are of glass, they will break unless heated quite 
hot before filling them. 



Quinces, 



■ 



When the fruit is pared and cored, put them into a kettl 
■with water enough to cover them, and* boil until quite tender 
but not soft. Cut them in rings, and put on them their weight 
in sugar, and let them stand while the cores and parings are 
boiled, in the same water from which they were taken, in order 
to make the syrup richer. Boil them soft and strain the water. 
Have the kettle cleaned ; put in the quinces and let them 
simmer with the sugar and water the parings were boiled in. 
Skim well, and when clear take up the quinces and boil the 
syrup longer. 

Pears. 

Pare the fruit, leaving the stems on, and put into cold water. 
You may remove the core, or not, as you please. Make 
syrup of a pound of sugar and half a pint of water to ever] 
pound of pears, and boil with some lemon-peel or green 
ginger. Put in the fruit and cook until clear, and let the 
syrup remain over the fire until thick. 



/Strawberries. 

Gather the berries in dry weather, pick out the firmest and 
largest, and stem them. If you stem them as you remove 
from the vine they will be nicer. To every pound of berries 
take a pound of white sugar. Dissolve the sugar in wine, 
allowing a wineglassful to a pound, and clarify and boil it. 
Then pour in any juice that runs from the strawberries, and 
skim it well. When boiling, put in the strawberries, and to 
every pound of fruit as much pulverized alum as will lie on 
the blade of a penknife. Let them boil a few minutes and 
they are done. Try them by taking one from the syrup and 
cutting it in halves. Do not stir them. Remove carefully 
from the syrup and boil it longer. Have small jars or pint 
tumblers of common glass heated until so hot you cannot 
hold them in your hand, and when the syrup has been taken 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 95 

from the fire a few minutes, fill the jars with the fruit, and 
pour over the syrup, and seal up tightly. 



Cranberries. 

Allow their weight in sugar, and add water in the propor- 
tions of half a pint to two pounds. Boil the syrup, and when 
well skimmed put in the berries and boil till clear. To make 
a sauce of them, allow only three-quarters of a pound of sugar 
to one of fruit. 

Blackberry Jam. 

To six quarts of ripe berries take three pounds of brown 
sugar, and wash all together with a spoon. Put it into a 
kettle and boil two hours, stirring frequently. Put in any 
spices you like, or omit them. When cool, put it into a jar, 
cover with brandied paper, and seal, and it will keep for years. 



Ripe Fox-Grape Jam. 

Put your grapes into a stew-pan over the fire until they are 
scalded ; then drain them well, and rub through a sieve, and 
add a pound of sugar to a pint of pulp, and boil until done, 
stirring constantly. 



To clarify Sugar for Sweetmeats. 

To every four pounds of sugar take a quart of water and the 
beaten whites of two eggs. Stir the eggs, sugar, and water 
together well before putting over the fire. When it comes to 
a boil, throw in a little cold water ; the scum will remain on 
the top, and can be easily removed with a perforated skimmer. 
Boil up and skim it three times, and put in the fruit. 



Blackberry Jelly. 

Wash three quarts of the berries, and set them over the 
fire with a pint of water. When they have stewed half an 



96 DIXIE COOKERY. 

hour, strain out the juice and allow a pint of sugar to every 
quart of it. This is very fine jelly, and will keep two years. 



Very Fine Apple Jelly. 

Wash and quarter the fruit without paring it, and put into a 
kettle and cover with water. Boil till perfectly soft. Then 
strain the juice off, and to every pint of it allow half a pound 
of sugar. Don't put in a spoon after the sugar is dissolved. 
Boil for nearly an hour, or until it jellies. When done, strain 
through a thick cloth. If the jelly is not firm, put in some 
lemon-juice and heat it over, or some gelatine. If you wish it 
very light, take light-colored fruit, and make only a small 
quantity at a time. Quince jelly is made in the same way. 



Currant Jelly. 

Pick off the stems, bruise the fruit, strain off the juice, and 
to every pint of juice take three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Stir together until it is dissolved, place over the fire skimming 
it well, and when it has boiled for fifteen minutes it will be 
done. Try it by putting some in a saucer, and when it is 
cold, if it is not firm enough, boil it longer. Fill up sm/ill 
common glass tumblers with it, and seal up immediately. 
Ripe fox-grapes make an excellent jelly by stewing them with- 
out water until soft, and taking a pint of juice to a pound of 
brown sugar. 



Gelatine Jelly. 

Soak two ounces of gelatine in as much cold water as will 
cover it. Then take it out and dissplve it in two quarts of 
boiling water. When cool, add the beaten whites of four 
eggs, the juice and rind of two lemons, and a pound of loaf- 
sugar, and let it boil twenty minutes, and strain through a 
jelly-bag. Be careful not to press the bag. If you wish wine 
in it, add a pint to this quantity, of any light-colored wine. 



PRESERVES AND JELLIES. 97 

Calves'-Foot Jelly. 

Boil four feet well, strain the liquor, and remove all the fat. 
When cool and the jelly is stiff, wipe it with a towel, to re- 
move any fat that may remain. Put into a kettle, and when 
dissolved take it from the fire, and when cool (but not cold) 
stir in the whites and shells of four eggs, half a pound of 
sugar, the juice and rind of two lemons, and a little wine. 
Boil all together for five minutes, and strain through flannel 
dipped in hot water, into moulds. 



Pigs'-Feet Jelly. 

To one quart of stock take half a pound of loaf-sugar, one 
pint of wine, one wineglassful of brandy, the rind and juice of 
two lemons, a few sticks of cinnamon broken up, a little mace, 
and the whites of three eggs strained, not beaten, and the 
shells broken up ; mix all these ingredients well together, and 
boil for forty minutes. Do not stir it. Then throw in a pint 
of cold water, and let it boil ten or fifteen minutes longer. 
Strain through a flannel bag with a thin layer of cotton at the 
bottom of it. If you have no lemons, use a part of a tum- 
bler of strong white vinegar, and use the essence of lemon. If 
the stock has not kept well, boil it over, and strain it before 
making the jelly. 

Green Fox-Grape Jelly. 

Boil in enough water to keep them from burning, and until 
the skins, burst ; strain them, and put a pound of sugar to a 
pint of juice, and let it boil half an hour. 

Ripe grapes made in the same way. 



Isinglass Jelly. 

To one ounce of shaved isinglass take a quart of water, and 
boil it down to a pint, and strain it through a flannel bag. 
Add a glass of wine and some sugar before straining. Stir it 
and put it in glasses. 



98 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Gelatine Jelly without boiling or straining. 






To a package of gelatine take a pint of cold water, the 
juice of. three lemons, and the rind of one. Let it stand an 
hour, and then add three pints of boiling water, a pint of 
wine r and two pounds and a quarter of white crushed sugar. 
A wineglassful of brandy will improve the flavor. Pour into 
moulds, and set in a cool place. 



Orange Jelly. 

Take a pint of juice to a pound of sugar, and an ounce of 
dissolved isinglass to a dozen of oranges, and boil and skim 
for fifteen minutes. Mix in a little of the grated rind, and 
when done pour into a mould. 



To conserve Peaches. 

Pare and cut your fruit, and to each pound of fruit take 
three-quarters of a pound of loaf-sugar. Boil them until 
clear, take them out, and drain them slightly, and spread on 
dishes to dry. Sprinkle a little sugar on them every day, and 
if any syrup is formed, remove them to fresh dishes. When 
quite dry, lay them lightly in a jar with alternate layers of 
sugar. Quinces are nice, done in the same way. The syrup 
boiled a little longer makes a delightful cordial, and will keep 
well for years. Another way to prepare peaches is to take a 
pound of sugar, and water enough to dissolve it, and when 
the syrup boils, drop in a pound of peaches cut in thick slices, 
and cook until half done. Then dry in the sun. One pound 
of sugar will be sufficient for six pounds of peaches, boiling 
only one pound of fruit at a time. The cordial from them is 
very fine. 

Glass-Melon Preserves. 

Pare and scrape outside and inside until very thin, first 
cutting a hole the size of a dime at each end. Soak in salt 
and water a day or two, then in weak alum-water twenty-four 
hours, and then in fresh water till the alum taste is removed. 



SYRUPS, CREAMS, ICES, CORDIALS, ETC 99 

Boil till tender in strong Jamaica ginger tea. Make a syrup 
of a pound and a half of loaf-sugar and a pint of water to 
every pound of fruit. Drop in the melons and boil till clear. 
They will be lighter colored to omit the boiling in ginger tea; 
using cold water instead, and after boiling in the sjTup and 
removing from the fire, flavor with lemon essence. It is nicer, 
too, to scrape them and not pare them. They keep well. For 
variety, cut some of the melons in halves after scraping them 
on the outside, remove the inside, and notch the edges pret- 
tily. 

Bread Jelly. 

Boil a quart of water, and, when cold, put into 'it a small 
loaf of bread sliced thin and toasted brown. Set it on some 
coals in a covered vessel, and boil gently until you find it has 
become a perfect jelly. Strain through a thin cloth, and set 
away until wanted. When it is to be taken, sweeten with loaf- 
sugar, and flavor with lemon, and warm a teacupful of it at a 
time. 



SYRUPS, CREAMS, ICES, CORDIALS, ETC. 

Italian Cream. 

Make a boiled custard of six or eight eggs to a quart of 
milk, flavor with vanilla, and add half an ounce of gelatine to 
a quart of custard. When quite thick, stir in as much rich 
syllabub as you like. 



Lemon or Orange Cream. 

Take a pint of thin cream, sweeten it quite sweet, add a 
glass of wine, and the juice and grated rind of an orange or 
lemon. Cut the whites of three or four eggs to a stiff froth, 
and add these to the cream, stirring them rapidly, and fill your 
glasses at once. You may churn with a syllabub churn in-

stead of stirring it, before filling the glasses. Or you may 
grate the rind of four oranges into half a pint of cold water, 
and let it stand twelve hours, and then add the juice of a 
dozen oranges and another half pint of water. -Beat the yolks 
of three eggs and the whites of eight, and strain the juice 
over the egg. Set it over the fire, and make it quite sweet 
with loaf-sugar. When it begins to thicken, take it from the 
fire and stir till cold, and serve in glasses. It is very nice 
frozen. 

Almond Cream. 

Roll a pound of blanched almonds fine with a bottle, put- 
ting in a few drops of rose-water, and then stir them into a 
quart of cream. Sweeten with loaf-sugar, and put it over the 
fire and stir till it thickens. 



Imitation Cream. 

Beat three eggs, the whites and yolks separately. Bo'il a 
few peach-leaves in a quart of cream, strain and sweeten it, 
and stir in the yolks of the eggs. Put in the beaten whites, 
set over the fire, and when thick take it up and pour out to 
cool. Serve with any kind of fruit. 



Swiss Cream. 

Boil half a pint of cream, the same quantity of milk, a 
piece of lemon-rind, and enough loaf-sugar to sweeten it. 
Thicken this with a teaspoonful of flour, and when nearly 
cold, add the juice of a lemon to it ; this will thicken it. 
Then put into a glass dish and stick macaroons in it, or put 
in glasses. 

Pine-apple Cream. 

Put into a bowl twelve tablespoonfuls of grated apple, the 
same proportion of cream, and beat well together, with a pint 
and a quarter of lemon jelly made with an ounce and a half 
of gelatine. Lemon-juice and sugar to your taste. Froth 
thick cream and put on the top.

Raspberry Cream. 

Rub a quart of raspberries through a sieve to take out the 
seeds, and then mix it well with some cream, and sweeten 
with sugar to your taste. Put it in a bowl and froth with a 
syllabub churn, taking off the froth as it rises. When you 
have as much froth as you want, put the rest of the cream 
into a deep glass bowl or dish, and put the frothed cream on 
it, as high as it will stand. 



Strawberry Cream. 

Make it in the same way as raspberry cream. The coloring 
may be improved by using a little of the rose-coloring for ices 
and /jellies. 

To preserve Cream. 

Scald thick cream and it will keep twenty-four hours, and 
if you sweeten it with sugar (powdered), it will keep two 
days. By boiling and skimming the cream, and putting in 
loaf-sugar in the proportion of a pound of sugar to every 
quart of cream, and boiling twenty minutes longer, and bot- 
tling and sealing when partly cool, it will be nice for weeks. 
Seal the bottles with rosin. 



Orange Syrup. 

Squeeze the juice and strain it, and to every pint of it add 
a pound and a half of powdered sugar.- Boil it slowly and 
skim it well, and when the scum ceases to rise, take it from 
the fire, let it grow cold, and bottle it. Secure the corks well. 
It is a nice flavoring for pudding-sauces, or custards, or punch. 



Lemon Syrup. 

One quart of water and three pounds of sugar boiled and 
skimmed well, and when of the consistency of honey and 
quite hot, stir in three-quarters of an ounce of tartaric acid 
9* 



J 02 DJXITC COOKERY. 

previously rubbed well in a mortar with twenty-five drops of 
essence or oil of lemon. It will require but twelve drops of 
the oil of lemon, or even less will do. The essence is best, as 
the oil is seldom very fresh. The essence and acid must be 
well mixed. A small quantity in cold water is a good substi- 
tute for lemonade of fresh lemons. 



Lemon Syrup for Seasoning. 

Pare the lemons very thin, and put the peel to boil in a 
quart of water ; cover it, and put two pounds of loaf-sugar to 
a dozen lemons, and boil till it becomes a rich syrup. Keep 
it well corked to season ice creams with. 



Lemon Juice. 

Boil together three pounds of loaf-sugar, three quarts of 
water, and a quart of strained lemon juice until the scum 
rises and the syrup is quite rich. Then strain and bottle it. 



Pine-apple Syrup, 

Pare and cut the fruit in pieces, an# boil three pounds of 
it, with a quart of water, till soft ; then mash and strain it, 
and to a pint of this juice put a pound of sugar, and boil it 
till it is a rich syrup, and keep it corked in bottles to season 
ice cream. 

Strawberry Syrup. 

Mash, and strain the juice, and to every pint of it put a 
pound of sugar, and boil it till quite a rich syrup is formed. 
Then bottle and cork it. 



Mountain Nectar. 

Put six pounds of sugar, four ounces of tartaric acid, and 
two quarts of water ; put all into a porcelain kettle, and let it 
come almost to a boil, but not quite to the boiling-point. 



SYRUPS, CREAMS, ICES, CORDIALS, ETC. 103 

Then take it off and stir in the whites of four well-beaten 
eggs. Strain it, and when it is cool, flavor it richly with 
essence of lemon. It will keep for months. Two tablespoon- 
fuls of this mixture, and two-thirds of a glass of ice-water, to 
be put into a goblet, and when ready to drink, a small quan- 
tity of soda stirred in, which will make it effervesce finely. 



Strawberry or Blackberry Acid. 

Stem, wash, and pick, twelve pounds of fruit, and put in 
dishes,. and sprinkle over them five ounces of tartaric acid, 
and pour over them two quarts of water. Let it stand thus 
for forty-eight ho,urs, ana strain it without bruising the fruit, 
and to every pint of juice add from one to one and a quarter 
pounds of powdered white sugar. Stir till dissolved, and 
leave it uncovered for a few days. Then bottle, and if inclined 
to ferment, leave the corks out for a few days. 



Pine-apple Cider (very fine) . 

Cut the rind of one large pine-apple or two small ones, into 
small pieces ; put them into a pitcher with two quarts of 
water. Tie a piece of thin cloth over the pitcher, and let it 
stand to ferment. Then strain it and sweeten to your taste. 
Put into bottles, cork tightly, wire them well, and lay on the 
side. It will be ready for use in forty-eight hours. 



Raspberry Vinegar. 

Squeeze the juice from three pints of raspberries, and mix 
with one pint of the best white vinegar and a pound of loaf- 
sugar. Simmer in a jar or pitcher, set in boiling water for an 
hour, skim it, and bottle when cold. Put a teaspoonful of this 
into half a pint of spring water. 



Strawberry Vinegar. 

Put four pounds of very ripe strawberries into three quarts 
of the best vinegar, and let them stand three or four days. 



104 DIXIE COOKERY. 

Then drain the vinegar through a jelly-bag, and pour on to the 
same quantity of fruit. Then strain again, and to every 
pound of liquor add one pound of sugar ; bottle, and let it 
stand covered, but not corked, a week. Then cork tightly, 
and set in a dry, cool place. 



Muscadine Wine. 

To 'One gallon of grapes mashed, take one quart of cold 
water; then strain immediately, and to every gallon of juice 
take three pounds of white sugar. Let it stand in a- jug with 
the cork loose, to ferment. When it has done fermenting, 
strain again through flannel, and bottle and se^d. 



Ginger Beer. 

Put Tnto a vessel two gallons of boiling water, two pounds 
of common white sugar, two ounces of ginger bruised, and 
two ounces of cream of tartar or a sliced lemon. Stir them 
until the sugar is dissolved, let it stand until as warm as new 
milk, then add two tablespoonfuls of good yeast poured on to 
a piece of bread. Cover the whole over with a cloth, and let 
it stand undisturbed for twenty-four hours. Then strain it and 
put into bottles, only filling them three-quarters full. Cork 
the bottles well, and tie the corks, and in two days, in warm 
weather, it will be fit to drink. This quantity will make 
thirty-six bottles. 

Blackberry Cordial. 

Mash and strain the berries, put on the juice to boil, skim 
it well, and to every gallon of juice put three pounds of sugar 
and a quart of spirits ; bruise some cloves and put in, and 
when cool bottle it. 

Cherry Cordial*

pounds of sugar. Dissolve the sugar in a little water, and 
when it comes to a boil strain it and mix with the juice, and 
to this quantity add half a pint of spirits. . Bottle when cold. 



SYRUPS, CREAMS, ICES, CORDIALS, ETC. 105 



Quince Cordial. 

* 

Grate the quinces and strain them, and to every quart of 
juice put a pound of sugar and a pint of spirits. Boil, strain, 
and bottle it. 

Blackberry Wine. 

To every gallon of berries, after being well mashed, a quart 
of boiling water. Let it stand twenty-four hours, then strain, 
and add three pounds of loaf-sugar to every gallon of juice. 
Let it stand until it is done fermenting, for three or four 
weeks, with the bung laid on loosely. At the end of three or 
four weeks, stop it tightly, and set away for some months, and 
then bottle it. Strawberry wine made in the same way, 
except that no water is added to the juice. 



Porter Beer. 

Take one bottle of porter, -five bottles of water, a pint of 
molasses or a pound of brown sugar. Make a strong ginger 
tea and mix all well together. This quantity will fill seven 
bottles. Put three or four raisins in each bottle, fill them, 
cork and wire them, and lay on their sides in a cool place. 



Corn Beer. 

Take a pint of corn, boil it until seffc, and add to it a gallon 
of water sweetened with a pint of brown sugar. Cork it 
tightly and set it in a warm place, and put into it a small quan- 
tity of yeast if the weather is cold. In warm weather omit 
the yeast. Add a few roots of bruised ginger, and a few 
sliced lemons. The same corn will answer for a year. 

When you pour out a pitcherful of beer, put in one of 
sweetened water. 



106 DIXIE COOKERY. 



Quinces, Peaches, and Apple Ice-Cream. 

* 

Grate some apples or other fruit very fine, and sweeten 
very sweet, and freeze. 



Lemon or Orange Ice-Cream. 

Strain the juice, mix it with the sugar, and stir slowly int 
the cream, and freeze it. 



Strawberry Ice- Cream. 



■ 



Mash a pint of berries, and strain the juice into a pint of 
cream, and sweeten very sweet, and freeze it. Or, flavor with 
the syrup. 

Carolina Ice-Cream. 

Make a thin custard of a quart of new milk and three well- 
beaten eggs, the whites and yolks whipped separately. Dis- 
solve a neaping teaspoonful of arrowroot in cold milk, and 
stir it in the custard while it is scalding. Let the custard 
simmer, but not boil. Sweeten to your taste, then strain it, 
and add the flavoring after it is cold, just before it is put into 
the freezer. 

Wilmington Ice-Cream. 

Take two quarts of milk, or cream if you have it, and boil, 
and thicken it with three tablespoonfuls of arrowroot. Sweeten 
with one pound of loaf-sugar, and pour the whole over the 
beaten whites of eight eggs. Then strain it, and when cold, 
add the flavoring. If you wish vanilla flavoring, boil half a 
bean in the milk. Corn-starch will take the place of arrow- 
root. In straining, a milk-strainer is sufficiently close to use. 



SYRUPS, CREAMS, ICES, CORDIALS, ETC. 107 



Fruit Ice-Cream. 

Mix the juice of the fruit with enough sugar to sweeten the 
cream, which need not be very thick. 



Lemon-Ice and Fruit-Ices. 

To a quart of lemonade, add the beaten whites of six eggs 
cut to a froth, and freeze it. Any other fruit can be used, 
straining the juice, and sweetening it before putting in the 
eggs. 

Rose-Coloring for Ices, Jellies, Creams, etc. 

Take a pint of pokeberry-juice that has been well strained, 
and add to it a pound of loaf-sugar. Boil till it becomes a 
jelly, and when cold put it in a jar and tie it close. A very 
small quantity will color ice-cream, or jelly, or cake-icing. 
Or, you may mix together a quarter of an ounce of cream of 
tartar, the same of powdered alum, and an ounce of powdered 
cochineal, with a saltspoonful of pearlash or soda, and four 
ounces of loaf-sugar. Boil this mixture for ten minutes, and 
when cool, bottle and cork it. 



Sherbet. 

Take nine oranges and three lemons. Grate off the yellow 
from the rinds, and put into a gallon of water, with three 
pounds of loaf-sugar, and boil to a candy-height. Then take 
it from the fire and add the pulp of the oranges and lemons, 
and keep stirring it until almost cold, it is then ready to 
freeze. 



108 DIXIE COOKERY. 

MISCELLANEOUS EECEIPTS. 

Coffee. 

Roast it quickly till it is a light-brown color, stirring it 
constantly, and when half cold stir in the beaten whites of 
two eggs to every two . pounds of coffee. Let the coffee get 
quite cold and dry, and £ut away in a tight box for use. 
When you are ready to boil it, grind and mix with a little cold 
water, allowing a heaping tablespoonful of coffee, and a tea- 
cup of boiling water to every person. Let it boil rapidly for 
half an hour, in a covered tin pot, stirring the coffee from'the 
sides occasionally, or it will have a bitter taste. Put in a 
teacupful of cold water to settle it, and after standing for five 
or six minutes, pour it off carefully into another coffee-pot, 
and send to table. 

To make biggin coffee, take two cupfuls of ground coffee to 
six of boiling water. Scald the biggin, put in the coffee, pour 
over the water, shut down the lid, and when the coffee has run 
through all the strainers, it is ready for the table. 



Blockade Coffee. 






Scald some rye in boiling water, and let it simmer for 
twenty minutes until it is slightly soft. Then remove from 
the fire and wash it in cold water, and parch as brown as 
coffee. To three tablespoonfuls of the ground rye take one 
tablespoonful of coffee, or a saltspoonful of the essence of 
coffee, and put into a tin pot, and pour over a quart of boiling 
water, and let it boil slowly for more than an hour. Let it 
settle and pour off, and you will find it quite clear without 
eggs, and very good. Okra seeds parched and ground, and 
mixed with coffee, in the proportion of one-fourth coffee to three- 
fourths of okra, is a very nice beverage, and a good substitute 
for coffee. 

Tea. 

Those persons who dislike black tea and cannot take green, 
will find a mixture of the two in equal proportions, an agree- 
able beverage. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 109 



Egg-Nogg. 

Beat separately the yolks and whites of six eggs, and stir 
into the j^olks sufficient powdered loaf-sugar to make it pleas- 
antly sweet, and beat them till very light, and flavor with a 
little lemon-juice and nutmeg. Beat in six tablespoonfals of 
brandy. Boil a quart of thin cream or new milk. Fill the 
goblets half full of the sugar and eggs, after stirring in the 
beaten whites just before putting into the glasses. Put a 
teaspoon in each goblet, and place them on a waiter so they 
can be distributed immediately after the milk is poured in. 
Pour the boiling milk into a pitcher, and fill up the goblets 
with it as you hand them around. Stir the milk and egg well 
together before drinking. 



Roman Punch. 

Grate the yellow rinds of two lemons and one orange on a 
pound of sugar ; squeeze over the juice, and let it stand till 
well dissolved. Strain, and add half a bottle of champagne 
and the beaten whites of four eggs. It is nice frozen, but 
may be served without anything else than a little finely 
broken ice. 



Lemon Juice and Peel to keep. 

Mix a pound of powdered loaf-sugar with a pint of juice, 
boil and skim it, and bottle, sealing well. Pare off the yellow 
part of the rinds of lemons, cut in small pieces, and.drop in 
brandy, whick will give a nice flavoring to sauces, etc. Or, 
rub off the yellow rind on lumps of sugar, and put in a glass 
jar, and cork well, for flavoring cakes. 



Cottage Cheese. 

Take a pan of clabber, pour off the whey, and put the 

clabber into a pointed muslin bag to drain. Let it drain 

twelve hours ; then put the curd into a dish, and work it, till 

very smooth, with a spoon, pouring over some rich cream 

10 



110 DIXIE COOKERY. 

until of the consistency of thin mush. Season with salt to 
your taste, and set in a dairy or some cool place until tea-time. 
Serve in a glass or china dish, and sprinkle a little pepper 
over the top. It is also nice for breakfast in warm weather. 



To prevent Preserves from Graining. 

Mix with them a teaspoonful of cream of tartar to every 
gallon of preserves. 




Milk. 






In warm weather, when milk sours soon, put in two table- 
spoonfuls of salt to every four gallons before straining. It 
will improve the qualit}', and increase the quantity of butter. 
It is recommended by the owner of a fine dairy. 



Brandy Peaches. 

Take fresh clingstones, and drop them for a minute in 
boiling lye. Remove from the lye with a perforated ladle, and 
drop in a bucket of cold water. Wipe with a rough towel to 
remove the skin, and drop into a syrup prepared in the mean- 
time of half a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Let 
them cook fifteen minutes, and take from the syrup, and put 
on dishes to cool.* Boil the s^yrup down to half, and put an 
equal part of old peach brandy, or French brandy, if you 
wish them very strong. They will be nicer with less brandy. 



Grapes in Brandy. 

Put some close bunches of grapes, not too ripe, in a jar, 
pricking each one with a needle. Fill up the jar with equal 
quantities of loaf-sugar syrup and French brandy. Make the 
syrup by taking half the weight of the grapes in sugar, and 
water enough to dissolve it, and boil and skim it well. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. Ill 



Rose Brandy for flavoring. 

Nearly fill a glass jar with rose leaves, and pour over French 
brandy enough to fill it quite up. Let it stand twenty-four 
hours, and pour into a thin muslin and press the leaves well. 
Return the strained liquid to the jar, and put in fresh leaves, 
and repeat this every day until you have a strong preparation. 
It is nice for cakes. 

To dry Peaches. 

Pare and slice them very thin. Their nicety and fine color 
will depend upon drying quickly, and the thinner and smaller 
the slices, the sooner they will be ready to put up. Dry on 
poplar boards with a rim around the edge, and never leave 
them out after sunset. A still nicer way is to make a syrup 
of a pound of sugar, and water enough to dissolve it, and when 
it has boiled, drop in the sliced peaches and cook until half 
done. Remove from the syrup with a perforated skimmer, and 
put on dishes in the sun until partly dry, and then on boards 
until perfectly dry. These peaches make nice pies in winter. 



To dry Cherries and Damsons. 

Stone the cherries, and press off the juice and dry perfectly. 
They are nice in fruit cake. Wash damsons, and put on with 
very little water to stew. Cook them until they are very thick 
and the juice nearly all evaporated. Be careful not to scorch 
them. When they are thick, remove as many of the stones as 
possible with a spoon. Spread them on dishes and dry in thin 
cakes until partly dry. Then remove them to waiters with 
towels under them and dry perfectly. Any seed remaining 
after they are put on dishes can be easily picked out. They 
are very nice in fruit cake cut up aTraisins, or stewed for pies 
or sauce, and will keep for years in paper bags, if well sunned 
occasionally. 

Rennet. 

Rub the salt from it and cut it up in small pieces, and put 
into a bottle and fill up with good Madeira wine. 



112 DIXIE COOKERY. 

A substitute for rennet is the juice of a lemon, or a teaspoon- 
ful of soda, to a quart of milk. A tablespoonful of rennet wine 
is sufficient for two quarts of milk, and must be put in whilst 
the milk is lukewarim 



To make Pickle-Lily. 

Scald some vinegar, and season with salt, pepper, cloves, 
mace, and allspice, and when highly seasoned and cold, pour 
into jars. Drop into this vinegar as they ripen, small cucum- 
bers, tender radish-pods, young beans, and very small onions. 
Cork close. 

Baked Chicken Pudding. 

Cut up, and stew two young chickens until half cooked ; then 
take them out and set aside to cool. Reserve the gravy to 
serve up separately. Have ready a well-beaten batter of six 
eggs, a quart of milk, a pound of flour, and a little salt, and 
fill up a dish with alternate layers of chicken and batter, hav- 
ing a layer of batter on the top. Bake until brown. Break an 
egg into the gravy, letitboil, and pour into a sauce-boat and 
serve with the pudding. 



Mariners 1 Soup. 

Boil the meat down to a thick jelly, seasoning highly with 
salt, wine, and spices, and spread on dishes a fourth of an inch 
thick. When cold, cut in square inches and dry in the sun, 
and keep in a tight glass or hermetically sealed ware cans. 
When you use them, put a quart of boiling water to one or two 
cakes, and add tomatoes and other vegetables, and thicken 
with brown flour. 



To remove white spots from Furniture. 

Rub the spots with pulverized pumice-stone wet with water, 
and then with buckskin moistened with sweet oil ; or, put a 
piece of paper on the spot, and hold a warm iron over it and 
rub with an oiled cloth. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 113 



To render cloth water-proof. 

Boil two pounds of turpentine and one pound of litharge in 
two or three pints of linseed oil. The articles to be brushed 
over with this mixture and dried in the sun. 



To clean Marble. 

Take two parts of soda, one part of pumice-stone, and one 
part of finely-powdered chalk, and sift through a fine sieve and 
mix with water. Rub over the marble, and wash off with soap 
and water. 

To clean Paint. 

Squeeze flannel nearly dry out of warm water, and dip in 
whiting and apply. "With a gentle rubbing it will remove 
grease and other stains. Wash in warm water and rub dry 
with a soft cloth. 

To clean Gold. 

Wash in warm water, with ten or fifteen drops of sal- volatile. 

To make old Gilt Frames look like Bronze. 

Put on lightly one or two coats of asphaltum with a soft 
brush, and then if not bright it can be varnished over with 
cabinet-makers' varnish. 



Very fine Whitewash. 

Take one peck of unslaked lime (in the rock) and put into 
a tub, which must be sunk in the ground or it will burst. Pour 
over boiling water until quite a thin mixture, and cover up the 
tub with a thick cloth to keep in the steam. Make a thin paste 
of a quart of flour and some water, straining it to remove all 
the lumps, and stir into the lime slowly after it has become 
slack. Add a pound of white sugar and a handful of salt and 
10* 



114 DIXIE COOKERY. 

it is ready for use. It must not be as thick as paint, and each 
coat must be quite dry before the other goes on. It will ad- 
here very well to hard plastering. 



Good Whitewash. 

To one bushel of lime take seven pounds of whiting and 
three pounds of white sugar, with four pounds of salt. Boil 
well together, aud after standing a few hours it assumes a 
beautiful appearance and is ready for use. Put on with a brush, 
and hot. 

To clean Glass Windows. 

Rub with a soft cloth and water, and rub dry and polish 
with newspaper. Lamp-shades the same way. 



To whiten Lard. 

To twelve gallons of lard add a pint of lye. Put the lye in 
when the the lard is first put on. When the cracklings are a 
light-brown the lard is done. Strain through a thin cloth put 
inside of a colander. 



To clarify Tallow and harden it. 

Take two pounds of alum to every twenty pounds of tallow. 
Dissolve it in water and put in a pint of lye, and put in the 
tallow before the water gets hot. Boil a whole day, and next 
day melt and strain the tallow. 



To preserve Butter for Winter. 

Take two ounces of saltpetre to every gallon of water. Make 
a strong brine of salt and boil until it is as clear as water and 
strong enough to bear an egg. Work the butter well, and 
make up into balls of two or three pounds each, and pour the 
brine over and cover well. It will keep for months. 



MISCELLANEOUS RECEIPTS. 115
