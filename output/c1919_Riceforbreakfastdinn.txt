THE INTRODUCTION 

This little series of books is a collection of tested and 
economical recipes for everyday foods that are obtainable 
everywhere and suitable for any of the three meals of the 
day. These recipes are written in plain, everyday terms. 
They are not all original the authors of many of them 
are unknown. They form just a little series of everyday 
books for everybody from everywhere. 

The war has given every homemaker an opportunity to 
realize the difference between USE and ABUSE of foods. 
For years we have wasted much of the bountiful supply of 
food produced by our country. Let us then not go back- 
ward, but let us go forward bending every energy to make 
lasting the benefit in health and economy gained from a 
diet that not only eliminates extravagance and waste in 
buying and serving, but also affords greater variety. 

The recipes in this series call for flour, sugar, and butter. 
To conserve these three foods just as long as our country 
and the Allies need them is the loyal and patriotic duty of 
- not the other fellow but you.

. RICE 

ORIGIN, USE, AND FOOD VALUE 

Importance. "May you have plenty of rice to-day" is 
the greeting in all parts of the world where this tiny grain 
is the symbol of prosperity. It is not a new food, for it 
was used by the Romans and Greeks and was mentioned 
several hundred years before Christ. To-day rice is the 
principal food for one-third of the world's population, is 
sold in every country, and is found on the tables of the rich 
as well as of the poor. It is not expensive when its cost 
and nourishment are compared with those of other foods. 

Rice deserves to be more appreciated and to be served 
three times a day, for it can be used in various ways : as a 
cereal, soup, salad, dinner vegetable, bread, dessert, invalid 
food, and in made-over dishes. 

Food value. While rice is deficient in protein, mineral 
matter, and fat, it is the richest cereal in starch. As an 
energy-giving food it leads the following : corn, wheat, oats, 
fat beef, lean beef, and potatoes. 

As a food to balance the diet, rice is ideal. 

Potatoes, bread, and other starchy foods should not be 
used at the same meal with rice, as they have the same 
food value. If used at all, they should be used sparingly. 

Rice and cheese make a good combination, for the cheese 
furnishes the protein and fat that the rice lacks. Tomato 
sauce with rice gives the acid and salts that are lacking. 

Either eggs, milk, or meat at the same meal with rice are 
good, served separately or in combination. Rice may also 
be served with beef, veal, chicken, and any lean meat. It 



4 THREE-MEALS-A-DAY SERIES 

may be eaten with beans, peas, cheese, and other highly 
nitrogenous foods. Because it has a low quantity of cellu- 
lose, rice is easy to digest and makes an excellent starchy 
food for young children. 

Grades of rice. There are three grades of rice: brown or 
unpolished rice, polished rice, and coated rice. The brown 
or unpolished rice is the only grade that retains the flavor 
of the whole grain. Few people really know the taste of 
rice, because in the polishing process rice loses not only 
flavor, but also much of its mineral salts. If once used, the 
brown rice will always be used, since it is richer in flavor. 

Rice is polished to improve its appearance. This polishing, 
however, does not improve it as a food, but rather detracts 
from both its food value and its flavor. 

Rice with the "shiny" look is coated. This rice has 
received a coating of glucose and talcum powder and is 
the most expensive kind. Glucose is a harmless substance 
that easily dissolves in cold water, but the adulteration of 
rice by substances that are not foods is quite unnecessary. 

HOW TO COOK RICE 

In the preparation of rice there are two principles that 
must be observed. First, it must be cooked long enough 
to render it digestible. If it is cooked in a double boiler, 
45 minutes should be allowed; if it is boiled directly over 
the stove, 30 or 40 minutes. Second, it must be cooked in 
such a way that the individual grains retain their shape. 
Instead of forming a pasty mass, the grains should remain 
separate from one another. 

It is always best to cook starchy foods slowly and at a 
low temperature rather than to boil them. Therefore it is 
preferable to steam rice. Never stir rice. 



RICE 5 

First wash rice through several waters, or until the water 
is unclouded. This will remove the foreign substances. 

BOILED RICE 

}^2 cup rice 2 cups water 

X teaspoon salt 

Bring water to boil, add salt and rice slowly, a little at a 
time to keep the grains separate. Cook until grains are 
soft. Drain through colander and pour % pint cold water 
through the rice to separate the grains. Cover pot with 
cloth and set on back of stove (warm place) for 10 minutes 
to allow the grains to swell. Run knife around side of pot 
to remove the rice. Serve hot. 

RICE IN DOUBLE BOILER 
y^. cup rice i^ cups water 

X teaspoon salt 

Have water boiling in upper part of double boiler and 
add salt and well- washed rice. Cover pot and allow rice 
to cook until grains are soft. Remove lid and cook until 
rice is dry, or pour off excess water and set pot in oven to dry. 

RICE IN FIRELESS COOKER 

y 2 cup rice i^ cups water 

i teaspoon salt 

Wash rice, add salt and rice to boiling water, boil 3 minutes. 
Place in fireless cooker, and cook i hour, or until soft. 

To REHEAT RICE 

Pour a little boiling water over the rice and heat with 
cover on vessel; or the best way is to place rice in colander 
over pot of boiling water for five minutes.

3 eggs 2< teaspoon salt 

Scald milk in double boiler, slowly drop in rice, and cook 
until very soft. Stir together yolks of eggs, sugar, salt, and 
grated rind of lemons. Add gradually the hot rice and 
milk, thinning with a little more milk, if necessary, to make 
it somewhat thicker than a boiled custard. Turn into a 
baking dish and bake in moderate oven 10 minutes. Beat 
the whites of the eggs very stiff and add to the sugar and 
the juice of the lemons. Cover the pudding with the 
meringue and bake it until a delicate brown. Serve cold

good thickening for soups in place of flour.
