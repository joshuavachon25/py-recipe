COOKERY, 

RATIONAL, PRACTICAL, AND ECONOMICAL; 
TREATED IN CONNEXION 

WITH 

THE CHEMISTRY OP FOOD. 
BY HARTELAW REID. 



" I could write a better book of Cookery than has ever yet been -written ; 
it should be a book on philosophical principles." — De. Johnsox. 

" Those [cooks] who wish to excel in their art, must only consider how 
the processes of it can he most perfectly performed."— !>■&. Kitchiner.

PEEFACE. 



The rapid sale of his First Edition has been extremely 
gratifying to the Author, more particularly as showing 
that he has succeeded in presenting a most important 
art in a light more in accordance with the spirit of the 
age than that in which it has hitherto been viewed. 
The present time is eminently scientific. No branch 
of knowledge or art will interest the student unless it 
has been systematized according to some few general 
laws or principles ; and the Author is convinced that it 
is the want of this in Cookery which has occasioned its 
recent comparative neglect, particularly among the 
middle classes. Our grandmothers were content when 
they happened to produce a palatable dish by following 
the directions of some old-fashioned empirical receipt- 
book, and never troubled themselves to distinguish those 
elements in its preparation to which its excellence, in 
common with that of all others of the same class, v/as 
due. Occasional and uncertain success like this, how- 
ever, seems to have been insufficient to tempt our mo- 
dern young ladies to preside in the kitchen, and cookery- 
books, as generally written, are notoriously defective in 
everything that can interest those educated in the style 
of the present day. Compared with Music and Paint- 
ing, Chemistry and Natural History, and a host of 



VI PREFACE. 

other subjects of modern culture, with their beautiful 
laws of harmony and proportion, how dry and uninte- 
resting must be the study of a cook's receipt-book 
where the most famous dish seems but an unmeaning 
jumble of heterogeneous eatables, and the only admitted 
" Proof of the Pudding is in the eating it" ! Yet in 
spite of all this it is really astonishing, when such a 
" proof" has been found satisfactory, with what eager- 
ness some young ladies will beg for a copy of " that 
receipt," thus showing the interest they naturally — per- 
haps instinctively — take in such matters ; and their dis- 
gust and disappointment may well be conceived when 
their pudding, though apparently founded on the same 
premises, turns out incapable of the same proof, the 
failure having arisen from the non-performance of some 
manipulation or mode of cooking deemed so unimpor- 
tant, or so generally known or obviously/ necessary (in 
the cook's opinion) as to render superfluous any men- 
tion of it in the receipt. Can we wonder, then, that in 
such circumstances Household Cookery is so often aban- 
doned to the wasteful mismanagement of a dirty maid- 
of-all-work or of an ignorant " plain cookr' 

To remedy such a state of matters has been the chief 
aim of this work, and the mode in which this has been 
attempted is fully expressed in the two quotations 
which appear in its title-page. The Author has sought 
to impart a rational understanding of every process, so 
that his readers may distinguish its essential pecu- 
liarities from those which merely mark its relation to 
a particular article of food. 

A merely empirical knowledge of specific receipts is 
but the pedantry of cookery, which many modern 
cookery-books seem specially designed to encourage. 



PREFACE. Vll 

On consulting some of them, one might almost sup- 
pose that the precise proportioning of ingredients and 
seasonings was everything, and the process nothing; 
— that there existed some mysterious virtue in certain 
relative quantities, without which every effort of 
cookery must be an utter failure. Now the real fact 
is the very reverse of this. Great latitude may be 
allowed in proportioning ingredients, provided their 
treatment otherwise be correct. Indeed, to insist upon 
exactness in this respect leads, in nine cases out of tep, 
to an unsatisfactory result, which is very possibly the 
secret cause of the general dissatisfaction regarding 
most cookery-receipts. The reason of it will be evident 
when we consider that what pleases one palate offends 
another, and also that the flavour of almost every kind 
of vegetable seasoning varies in strength with the spe- 
cimen employed. But it is otherwise with the processes 
erf cookery. These bear relation to the chemical and 
mechanical properties of food, which never vary, and 
to the requirements of nutrition, which are equally un- 
changing. We do not mean to deny the possibility of 
an artistic combination of flavours : all we assert is, 
that for this no exact directions can be given. These 
can only be of the most general kind, such as the fol- 
lowing : — \st, The natural flavour of that which gives 
name to the dish ought always to predominate, — such 
adjuncts only being selected as will serve to heighten 
this ; 2d, If the principal ingredient be in itself insipid, 
the communicated flavour should be simple and distinct; 
and M, A mixture of decidedly different flavours ought 
never to be attempted unless the result be a close imi- 
tation of some other well-known flavour. In this way 
the cook will avoid equivocal mixtures, regarding which 



•Vm PREFACE. 

two persons with a slight difference in the constitution 
or habit of their organs of taste, might pronounce con- 
tradictory opinions. 

In accordance with the principles laid down in the 
foregoing remarks, the Chapters treating of the dif- 
ferent Processes are prefaced by paragraphs of " Ge- 
neral Directions," in which everything that is essential 
in these processes is particularly described. To these 
paragraphs, and likewise to Chapter IV., the author 
begs particular attention, as they are indispensable to 
a correct understanding of the receipts which follow 
them. In these also the same principles have ren- 
dered nearly superfluous any statement of exact pro- 
portions; but where such statements are made, they 
are only meant to show what is admissible — not to 
prescribe what is indispensable. 

Having in this way shown that cookery, like all 
other arts, has its general principles founded on the 
natural qualites of the subjects on which it operates, 
the author trusts he has imparted to it an interest 
suited to the enlightened taste of the present time. 
That he has to some extent been successful in this, 
the reception of his first edition has most agreeably 
testified ; and he hopes that the careful revisal which 
the second edition has undergone, together with its 
various additions and improvements, will render it 
fully as acceptable as the former. 

To render the book as nearly perfect as its limits 
will allow, its first three chapters contain remarks on 
household economy, together with a description of the 
various culinary processes, and of the utensils and ap- 
pliances required for each ; and the concluding chap- 
ter embraces a number of miscellaneous receipts which 



PREFACE. IX 

could not well be included in the previous ones. To 
this there are also appended some remarks on Dinners 
and Suppers, with directions for carving ; and likewise 
an Index of the times at which the various provisions 
are in season. 

The table of Contents is arranged partly by way of 
Index, to show the page on which the receipt for 
each dish is to be found, and also that containing the 
General Directions for the class to which it belongs, 
which ought to be studied in connection with each par- 
ticular receipt. The contents of Chapters V. to IX. are 
arranged together in a tabular form as being more con- 
cise. It is hoped that the book will thus not only be 
rendered useful to those who already possess some ex- 
perience in domestic management, but will also serve 
as an elementary guide-book to young housekeepers ; 
to whom it is most respectfully dedicated, by their 
obedient servant, 

THE AUTHOR.

INTRODUCTION, 



The Art of Cookery is one of the natural developments 
of Civilization. Viewed in this light it ought not to 
be despised as a mere pander to luxury, for experience 
proves that it is absolutely necessary to the healthful 
existence of the man of sedentary and in-door habits. 
The savage who has daily to fish for his breakfast and 
hunt for his dinner, or the ploughman who labours in 
the fields from dawn till dusk, can, and does, easily 
consume and digest food prepared in a way that would 
soon prove fatal to the equally laborious artizan of 
the workshop, or to the merchant, student, or lawyer, 
whose duties confine them to the counter, the library, 
or the desk. Now, although the cookery of the citizen 
is undoubtedly much superior to that found sufficient for 
the peasant or the savage, still it is, in this country at 
least, very inferior to what it ought to be ; and hence 
dyspepsia and other derangements of the digestive 
organs are so prevalent. May it not be that these de- 
rangements, becoming hereditary among townspeople, 
contribute largely to increase their infant mortality so 
much beyond that of the peasantry? Should it prove 
so, we may say, literally — " The fathers have eaten sour 
grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge." 

But the evils of bad cookery do not end here. The 
injury done to the physical, infects also the moral na- 
ture, and the victim of indigestion exhibits a fretful

dissatisfied ill-humour, which renders his life a burden 
to himself and a torment to those around him. There 
is hardly a more fruitful or a less suspected source of 
domestic discord than this, which is all the worse that 
it does not exhibit itself in any violent outbursts, but 
gradually produces estrangements resulting in unjust 
and painful suspicions. 

There is yet another evil consequence of bad cookery. 
The oppression of undigested food leads to that habi- 
tual use of stimulating drinks to which so large a part 
of the misery and degradation of this country may be 
be traced. This is a point to which we earnestly call 
the attention of teetotalers. 

That our British cookery has generally been felt to 
be very defective, is strikingly evidenced by the great 
demand which has so long existed for good cookery- 
books, and the consequent success of many of even 
doubtful utility. Nothwithstanding the vast number 
of such works which has been published, it must be ad- 
mitted that a book of truly economical cookery is still a 
desideratum. Hitherto cookery-books have generally 
been little else than long and often ill -arranged lists of 
receipts for expensive dishes, requiring for their prepa- 
ration many curious and costly utensils. To the artizan 
these are of course useless, while to many of the middle 
class they are worse, as the attempt to keep a genteel 
table by following their directions is sure to entail a 
ruinous expense. But it is not solely the costliness of 
the prescriptions of the authors of these works that is 
objectionable. They are often curiously learned in the 
pleasures of the eye and the palate, and yet lamentably 
ignorant of the requirements of the stomach. Their 
stimulating seaonings excite an artificial appetite which 



INTRODUCTION. 3 

tempts the incautious eater to indulge to excess in what, 
even if partaken of moderately, would prove injurious. 

It has been said that a Frenchman can cook a pair 
of old boots into a first-rate dinner. Now though we 
do not profess to enable our readers to accomplish this 
particular feat, still we hope to show them what care- 
ful cooking can accomplish with materials which many 
would consider nearly worthless. The fact is, that the 
old-boots proverb is merely another way of stating that 
the French are in the habit of living well upon food 
which, cooked after our rude British fashion, would 
be absolutely uneatable. They can convert what we 
should consider bad meat and vegetables into nutritious 
and palatable food. Why should not we endeavour to 
make our good materials at least as eatable as the 
Frenchman's bad ones, instead of, as is too frequently 
the case, rendering them both tasteless and indigestible 
through ignorance of the first principles of cookery ? 

The main object of the present work is to show the 
economically disposed housewife how she may at a 
small expense provide her husband and family with a 
good dinner, which shall be at once wholesome and 
palatable because properly cooked, and, for the same 
reason, cheap. It is proposed to do this not merely by 
giving approved receipts for plain dishes, but especially 
by directing attention to those General Principles 
upon which all good cookery depends. These have 
been long known practically to the French ; and having 
been of late years scientifically cpnfirmed, they now 
rank as facts of organic chemistry. 



4 PROVIDING. 

CHAPTER I. 

RULES FOR PROVIDING. 

A CERTAIN practical lady, giving a receipt for making- 
hare soup, began with — "First catch your hare.*' Upon 
the same principle we shall premise our instructions in 
cooking by a few hints on procuring and keeping pro- 
visions. 

1. In the first place, the housewife ought always, 
where it is possible, to do her marketing herself, and 
pay ready -money for everything she purchases. This 
is the only way in which she can be sure of getting the 
best goods at the lowest price. We repeat that this is 
the only way compatible with strict economy, because 
if a servant be entrusted with the buying, she will, if 
she is not a good judge of the quality of articles, bring 
home those she can get for the least money (and these 
are seldom the cheapest), and even if she is a good judge, 
it is ten to one against her taking the trouble to make 
a careful selection. When the ready -money system is 
found inconvenient, and an account is run with a trades- 
man, the mistress ought herself to write her orders 
in a pass-book to be sent to the shop to have the prices 
filled in, and to be returned along with the goods ; and 
on receipt of these she should see that they tally with 
lier entry in the pass-book. Where this is not done, it 
sometimes happens, either by mistake, or the dishonesty 
of the tradesman or his shopman or the servant, that 
payment is demanded for goods which were never 
ordered, and that those which were ordered are over- 
charged. The simplest and safest plan, however, is to 
avoid running accounts altogether, and to pay ready- 
money. By so doing, the housewife will escape a great 
deal of trouble and anxiety, besides saving the extra 
price which the tradesman charges upon all goods 



PROVIDING. ^ 

sold on credit, and to which he is justly entitled, both 
as interest for his money and to cover the losses to 
which the system sometimes subjects him. 

2. In purchasing perishable goods, care should be 
taken to get everything as fresh and neiu as possible. 
Tliis is absolutely necessary in the case of vegetables, 
ripe fruit, eggs, butter, and fish, as these cannot be 
used in too fresh a condition ; but as butcher meat 
requires to be kept some time, it may, where the 
butcher's word can be trusted as to the day on which it 
was killed, be purchased ready for cooking. Indeed 
this must often be done when a small supply of cut 
meat, such as steaks or chops, is required. As, how- 
ever, it is the butcher's interest to sell off his meat 
while fresh, in order to avoid the loss arising from its 
spoiling on his hands, he will seldom have any prime 
pieces which have been kept long enough for immediate 
use, so that it is much safer, as a general rule, to ask for 
it fresh, and keep it at home. Perhaps the best plan 
is to ascertain which day of the week is the butcher's 
regular " killing day," and to buy upon that day only 
a quantity sufficient to last some time, — which quantity 
must be determined by the season of the year ; for since 
meat keeps longer in winter than in summer, a larger 
stock may be laid in then. Many a good dinner has 
been spoiled, and many a fine piece of meat wasted, and 
this not from ignorance of the time it ought to be kept, 
but from inattention to the above rule. 

3. When it is ascertained where the best and cheap- 
est articles are sold, it is as well to lay in as large a 
stock as can be afi'orded at one time, of those provisions 
which do not spoil by keeping. By so doing, the house- 
wife will not only have a good supply of the best always 
at hand, but will also be allowed certain discounts from 
the price, which she would not otherwise obtain, besides 
saving much time and trouble in shopping. Not only 
will she have to go oftener to the shop for small sup- 
plies, but it may frequently happen that when she ap- 
plies for a second small quantity of an article that has 



6 HOW TO CHOOSE 

been approved of, she may find the dealer's stock of 
that particular commodity renewed, and the new supply 
not so good ; and she then will either have to purchase 
an inferior article, or to wander from shop to shop in 
search of a better. Of course this rule must be disre- 
garded when, at the time of purchase, there is reason 
to expect an immediate fall in the price. For instance, 
it would be absurd to buy a three months' supply of 
tea at 4s., with the knowledge that within a month there 
might be such a reduction of duty upon it as would 
lower its price to 3s. Such cases, however, occur very 
rarely. 

SIGNS OF GOOD QUALITIES IN PROVISIONS. 

To facilitate the choice of the best provisions, the 
following indications of quality should be attended to. 

BTTTCHEIl MEAT. 

As a general rule, the best meat is that which is mo- 
derately fat. Lean meat must have been ill fed, and 
will be tough and tasteless. Very fat meat, though it 
may be good, is not economical ; and therefore, when 
none else is to be had, the butcher ought to directed 
to cut off the superfluous suet before weighing it. 

1. Beef. The flesh should feel tender, have a fine 
grain, and a clear red colour. The fat should be mode- 
rate in quantity, lying in streaks through the lean, and 
its colour should be white or mry liglit yellow. Ox beef 
is the best, — heifer very good if well fed, — cow and 
bull, decidedly inferior. 

2. Mutton. The flesh, like that of beef, should be 
of a good red colour, perhaps a shade darker. It should 
be fine-grained, and well streaked with fat, which ought 
to be white and firm. The mutton of the black-faced 
breed of sheep is the finest, and may be known by 
the shortness of the shank ; the best age is about five 
years, though it is seldom to be had so old. Wether 
mutton is superior to either ram or ewe, and may be 



BUTCHER MEAT, BACON, &C. 7 

distinguished by having a prominent lump of fat on the 
broadest part of the inside of the leg. The flesh of the 
ram has a very dark colour and is of a coarse texture ; 
that of the ewe is pale, and the fat yellow and spongy. 

3. Veal. Its colour should be white, with a tinge 
of pink ; it ought to be rather fat, and feel firm to the 
touch. The flesh should have a fine delicate texture. 
The leg-bone should be small ; the kidney small and 
well covered with fat. The proper age is about two or 
three months ; when killed too young, it is soft, flabby, 
and dark-coloured. The bull-calf makes the best veal, 
though the cow-calf is preferred for many dishes on ac- 
count of the udder. 

4. Lamb. This should be light-coloured and fat, and 
have a delicate appearance. The kidneys should be 
small and imbedded in fat, the quarters short and thick, 
and the knuckle stiff". When fresh, the vein in the fore 
quarter will have a bluish tint. If the vein look green 
or yellow, it is a certain sign of staleness, which may 
also be detected by smelling the kidneys. 

5. Pork. Both the flesh and the fat must be white, 
firm, smooth, and dry. When young and fresh, the lean 
ought to break when pinched with the fingers, and the 
skin, which should be thin, yield to the nails. The 
breed having short legs, thick neck, and small head, is 
the best. Six months is the right age for killing, when 
the leg should not weigh more than 6 or Tibs, Measley 
pork is known by the fat being mottled with little 
lumps and kernels. 

Generally, all meat, when not fresh, has a tainted 
smell about the kidneys, and the eyes are sunk and 
shrivelled instead of being plump and full. 



Bacon and Ham may be considered good when the 
rind is thin, the fat white and firm, and when the flesh 
adheres to the bone and has a clear, darkish red colour, 
not streaked with yelloAV. To test the perfect fresh- 
ness of ham, run a knife into it close to the bone, and 
if when drawn out it has a pleasant smell, and is not 



8 HOW TO CHOOSE EGGS, 

smeared, the ham is fresh. If either bacon or ham have 
the slightest tinge of yellow in the fiit, it will soon be- 
come rancid. 

Butter and Cheese should be judged of by tasting. 

Eggs. It is difficult to discover if an egg be fresh. 
The best plan is to hold it between the eye and a 
lighted candle, close to the light, when if it appears 
equally transparent throughout, it may be pronounced 
good, but if there are any cloudy spots apparent it may 
be rejected as stale. 

POULTRY. 

Birds of all kinds are best when young. The thin 
bone projecting over the belly will then feel soft and 
gristly ; if it is stiff and hard, the bird is old. All 
poultry should be firm and fleshy. 

1. Fowls are best when short and plump, with broad 
breast and thick rump, the legs smooth and the spurs 
short and blunt. The black-legged kind are the most 
juicy. In capons, the comb should be short and pale — 
in cocks, short and bright red. If fresh, the vent will 
be close and dark ; when stale, it will be tainted, and 
the eyes sunk. 

2. Turkeys. The same remarks apply to these as 
to fowls. The cock turkey is preferable to the hen. 
When young, the toes and bill are soft. 

3. Geese. The flesh should be of a fine light pink 
tint, the liver pale, the fat white and soft, and the breast 
full and plump. In a young goose, the feet and bill 
are yellow ; in an old one, reddish. It ought to have 
very few or no hairs on the body. 

4. Ducks. Young ducks are distinguished in the 
same manner as young geese. The belly should be firm 
and thick. The drake is the best eating. 

4. Pigeons. The breast should be full and plump, 
and the feet elastic. When not fresh, they are flabby, 
and the vent discoloured. 



POULTRY, GAME, AND FISH. 



GAME. 

1. Wild F^I^l, when young, have soft quills, and 
should be plump, and hard in the vent. Old birds are 
distinguished by rigid bills, tough leg-sinews, and long 
and sharp spurs; they require to be kept longer than 
young ones. Small field-birds should always be used 
fresh. 

2. Venison. The flesh of good venison is dark, fine- 
grained, and firm, and the fat clear and bright, lying 
thickly on the back. When young, the cleft of the 
hoof is smooth and close. 

3. Hares and Rabbits are fresh when the body is 
rigid. Young ones have the claws smooth, sharp, and 
close, and the ears tender and easily torn. 

FISH. 

Stale fish furnishes such unmistakeable evidence of 
its condition, both to sight and smell, that the merest 
novice who should purchase it would be inexcusable. 
When perfectly fresh, the body is stifi* and elastic ; the 
gills close, difficult to open, and bright ; the fins lying 
flat to the sides ; the eyes bright and full ; the scales 
glistening and firmly attached to the body. When stale, 
it is the reverse of all this, and has besides a strong of- 
fensive smell. The best fish of all kinds have small 
heads and tails, thick bodies, and broad shoulders. 

TuRBOT. A good one has the belly cream-coloured ; 
and if that and the fins be streaked with'red, it is an 
additional sign of freshness. 

Skate. When good, the belly is white, tinged with 
lilac. The female is preferred. Those with large thorns 
are very inferior. 

Lobsters and Crabs should feel heavy ; — when light, 
they are filled with water; which may also be known 
in lobsters by the berries being large and brownish. 
In crabs, after being boiled, the water, if there be any, 
may be heard rattling on shaking them. The male is 
better than the female, and is distinguished in the lob- 



10 TO CHOOSE VEGETABLES, &C. 

ster by a narrow tail, in the crab by a narrow breast. 
The lobster when in perfection has a hard firm shell, 
and may be considered very superior if encrusted with 
marine animals. 

Prawns and Shrimps are good when their tails turn 
strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant 
smell. They are best when very red, and free from 
spawn under the tail. 

Oysters, if alive and healthy, will close upon the 
knife when being opened. Pandore oysters from the 
Firth of Forth, and those from the Kent coast in Eng- 
land, are considered the best. 

Mussels are very good and wholesome when gathered 
from banks on the open coast, but those from the mouths 
of rivers and harbours where there is much shipping 
are often highly dangerous, being impregnated with 
poisonous matter from the copper sheathing of the 
ships' bottoms. For the same reason, those from wet 
docks ought never to be used. 

Besides the above there are several other species of 
shell-fish, — viz. the Escalop, Razor-fish, Clams, 'and Coc- 
kles, which, though very good, are scarce, and not much 
used. Whelks are more plentiful, and are considered 
very wholesome. All bivalve shell-fish should be pro- 
cured alive, when the shells will be found firmly closed. 
If purchased ready cooked, as mussels and whelks often 
are, their freshness must be judged of by the smell. 

vegi:tabi.es. 

All Green Vegetables of the cabbage kind should be 
chosen with large, close, firm hearts. When fresh, the 
leaves are crisp and brittle ; when stale, they are lank 
and drooping. They ought to be used as soon as pos- 
sible after being gathered, as they are apt to spoil by 
long keeping. Such perfect freshness is not so abso- 
lutely necessary in roots such as potatoes, turnips, &c. 



KEEPING PROVISIONS. 11 

CHAPTER II. 
KEEPING PROVISIONS. 

Fresh Meat of every description sboiild be hung up in 
a cool, dry, airy place, and carefully wiped every day. 
It ought never to lie long in a dish. The length of 
time it should be kept varies with the weather, as 
during warm moist weather it spoils much sooner than 
in cold and dry weather. Game, generally, will keep 
longer than butcher meat, — two or three weeks j birds 
being kept with the feathers on, and hares paunched, 
but not skinned. Beef will require from four to ten 
days' keeping, or even longer in cold weather j and 
mutton, if well managed, will sometimes hang for a 
fortnight or even three weeks without spoiling — the 
longer the better. As young meat, however — veal, 
lamb, and pork — spoils very quickly, one, two, or three 
days at the utmost, suffices for it. Fowls will keep for 
a week, and turkeys a fortnight, but a goose not above 
nine or ten days. In plucking birds which have been 
kept some time, care should be taken not to break the 
skin, which will have become rather tender. 

As all animal food, however good in quality, and how- 
ever well it may be cooked, is uneatable when stale, 
and, except fish, will certainly prove tough if cooked 
too fresh, it becomes a matter of considerable difficulty, 
particularly during summer, to fix upon the proper 
day for cooking a piece of meat which has been kept. 
It is only by daily examination, and narrowly watch- 
ing the change which the meat undergoes, that the 
housewife will be able to arrest its decomposition at 
that stage, just short of being tainted, in which it is 
ready for being cooked. This is an art which can be 
acquired only by experience, and its successful practice 
requires considerable skill in household management. 
Thus, should unlooked-for cold weather have prevented 



12 KEEPING PROVISIONS. 

the meat reaching the proper cooking state upon the 
day calculated on, the prudent and active housewife 
will have to provide some other dinner for that day, 
and keep the meat till the next, or the next again. It 
cannot be too strongly impressed upon housekeepers 
that even the best butcher meat, when cooked too soon, 
will not be nearly so tender and palatable as meat much 
inferior, which has been kept the proper time. 

There are various ways of keeping meat sweet, and 
of removing the bad smell after it has become slightly 
tainted. One mode is to rub it over with coarsely- 
pounded charcoal, which has the property of absorbing- 
all the putrescent gases, and thus prevents the bad 
smell. The charcoal must of course be washed off be- 
fore cooking. Another way is to paint the meat all 
over with pyroligneous acid or wood vinegar, which is 
an antiseptic, and considerably retards the progress of 
decay. Should the decomposition have already gone 
rather too far, the meat may be partly restored by 
steeping it, for a short time before using, in a solution 
of chloride of lime. This latter plan is very useful, 
especially in warm weather, for game, which is gene- 
rally preferred with that high flavour produced by long 
keeping, as it entirely removes any accompanying smell. 
Dusting meat well with black pepper is a preservative 
against flies, which however will not get at it if it is 
kept in a properly constructed meat safe. This is a 
lock-fast box or closet, the sides of which consist of 
canvas, hair-cloth, or perforated zinc, stretched upon a 
frame. It should be placed in an airy yet sheltered 
situation, not exposed to the sun. A few shelves and 
several tinned hooks attached to the top or roof are its 
interior fittings. 

Cooked Meat ought to be kept as cool and dry as 
possible. When sent from table to be set aside for fu- 
ture use, it ought to be removed into a clean dry dish, 
keeping back the gravy, which is apt soon to become 
sour, and therefore ought to be kept in a seperate ves- 
sel. A cold joint is always richer and more juicy if it 



COOKING APPARATUS. 13 

has not been cut while warm, because when cut warm 
the juices run out at the incision. 

Green Vegetables cannot be kept longer than a day 
or two, and then it must be in a cool dry cellar, free 
from draughts of air, otherwise they are sure to lose 
their flavour and perhaps to ferment, in which case they 
become unwholesome. Each kind should be kept by 
itself, to prevent contamination of flavour. They should 
never be placed in water till immediately before being 
used. Eoots, such as carrots, turnips, &c., will remain 
good a considerable time if kept cool and dry ; but they 
must not be washed, but be stored in dry sand just as 
they are taken from the ground. In winter they must 
be protected from frost. Onions keep best when hung 
up in a cool but dry place, — the large ones strung, 
the small ones in nets. Parsley and other herbs may 
be preserved by drying them either in bunches tied 
to a rope in a warm kitchen, or spread out in an oven 
nearly cold. 



CHAPTEE III. 

COOKING APPAEATUS. 

A MOST important point in the economy of the kitchen 
is to cook with as little fuel as possible. To do this it 
is requisite that the apparatus should be complete, and 
no larger than is necessary for the requirements of the 
household. 

The Kitchen Range. It is a very common error 
to have this much too large, whereby a considerable loss 
is occasioned by an unnecessary consumption of fuel. 
The most economical form of range is that which has a 
comparatively small open fireplace in the centre, with a 
boiler on one side and extending round the back, and a 
small oven having a furnace underneath it on the other, 
— the whole being flat on the top. By means of such a 



14 COOKING APPARATUS FOR 

range, which may be had for £4 or £4 : 10s., the opera- 
tions of roasting, boihng, stewing, and baking, may all 
be carried on simultaneously. Although the furnace 
under the oven need only be used when baking is re- 
quired, yet the oven will always be sufficiently warm to 
heat dinner plates, whilst the boiler, which may be made 
self-filling, will furnish a constant and plentiful supply 
of hot water — an article which ought always to be obtain- 
able at a moment's notice in every house. M. Soyer has 
invented a range (considerably more expensive however 
than the above), which with one fire can roast, boil, 
broil, bake, fry, braise, and saute, all at the same time. 
It is so contrived as to stand in the middleof the kitchen, 
and occupies very little space. 

The various kitchen utensils, constituting the rest of 
the cooking apparatus, will be more properly described 
Avhen treating of the difi'erent processes for which they 
are required. 

1 . Roasting is performed by the direct action of the 
fire. The meat is suspended and kept in constant ro- 
tation in front of the fire by means of a twirling hook 
and a bottle-jack which is hung from a projecting arm 
or crane fixed in or above the mantel-piece. This arm 
has a number of notches on its upper side, by means of 
which the distance of the meat from the fire can be re- 
gulated at pleasure, and it moves upon a swivel, so that 
when not in use it may be turned back close to the wall. 
Beneath the meat is placed a stand containing a remov- 
able tin dish to catch the di'ipping, and from the back 
part of which a tin screen of a semicircular form, stands 
up behind the meat and reflects the heat upon it, there- 
by aiding the roasting. 

2, Broiling is the cooking of small articles, such as 
herrings, slices of meat, &c., over the fire, and by its 
direct action. It is perhaps the most ancient and pri- 
mitive mode of cooking. The savage hunter broils his 
steak cut from the still bleeding animal, upon the live 
embers of his wood fire. The civilized man, more 
cleanly, broils his upon a gridiron, over a clear smoke- 



ROASTING, BOILING, &C. 15 

less fire of coals, having- taken care to have it cut from 
an animal killed at least a week previously. In point 
of tenderness the two steaks are said to be upon a par. 
Those who have tried it, declare that meat cooked ivhile 
still ivarm from the newly-killed animal is very tender. 
Perhaps the steak cut from the live animal, said to be 
so much relished in Abyssinia, owes its popularity there 
to the same cause. 

The Gridiron should have small round bars, and must 
be kept thoroughly clean, not only on the top of the 
bars, but between them. For turning the meat, a 
pair of small tongs is preferable to a fork, which makes 
holes in it, through which the juice runs out. When 
the meat is in proper condition, broiling is by far the 
best mode of cooking, and it is certainly the most ex- 
peditious. 

3. Baking is best accomplished in a properly con- 
structed oven ; but small cakes, puddings, &c., can be 
very Avell baked in front of the fire in a " Dispatch," 
which is a tin box with an open front, so made as to 
reflect the heat equally over whatever is placed in it. 
Baking on a small scale may also be done over the fire 
in a large dry goblet, with a close fitting lid. As this 
however is apt to melt the tin lining, an old goblet 
which has already lost its lining ought to be used, and 
care should be taken to warm it gradually lest it be 
cracked by the heat. Whatever is baked in a goblet 
must be placed upon a tin trevet to keep it from the 
hot bottom. A large number of cakes or scones may 
be baked in this way by placing each upon a separate 
trevet, and making a pile of them inside the pot. 

4. Boiling is done in an iron pot (called a goblet in 
Scotland, in England a saucepan) tinned on the inside. 
It should be sufficiently large to contain water enough 
to cover the meat. Besides one or two large goblets, 
it is convenient to have several of the very smallest size, 
of block tin, for making sauces, &c. For boiling fish 
an oval tin fish-kettle is required, with a flat drainer to 
place beneath the fish while boiling, in order to lift it 
out whole when done. 



16 COOKING APPARATUS FOR 

5. Stewing differs from boiling in this, that a much 
smaller quantity of water is employed ; which being en- 
riched by the juices of the meat, is served as a gravy 
along with it. Meat cooked in this way has been re- 
commended as more wholesome than when boiled, be 
cause, the liquor in which it was cooked being taken 
along with it, it perfectly supplies the requirements of 
of the theory that as the human body is made up of 
precisely the same elements as raw butcher meat is, 
and these in precisely the same proportions, therefore, 
in order to supply the waste of the body, the meat 
ought to be eaten entire, with none of its constituents 
abstracted in the cooking. Although, however, ex- 
perience appears to confirm the truth of this theory in 
the case of boiled and stewed meat, it is to be feared 
that its strict application would necessitate our eating 
hones, and many other matters even not quite so palat- 
able or digestible. It may even be doubted whether 
the theory will apply at all, seeing that its propounders 
have analyzed merely the dead human body, and conse- 
quently cannot say Avhat the living body is composed 
of; or even granting it to be identical with the dead 
one, it never can be known that the changes which food 
undergoes during nutrition, which are admittedly not 
chemical, do not amount in some cases to actual trans- 
mutation of elememts. 

The Stew-pan is a much shallower vessel than the 
sauce-pan for boiling. It is also of iron, tinned inside. 
All boiling and stewing vessels ought to have close- 
fitting lids. 

6. Braising is a French improvement upon stewing. 
The method is nearly the same, the difference being 
that braising is done in an air-tifjht vessel, so that none 
of the volatile matters escape, and that the heat is ap- 
plied above as well as below. For this latter purpose 
live embers are placed upon the lid of the braising-pan, 
which is made hollow on the top to receive them. 
Braising is a very slow process, and perhaps its supe- 
riority over good stewing is not worth the extra trouble 
required. 



STEWING, FRYING, kC. 17 

7. Frying. There are two modes of frying. The 
first is called bj the French cooks sauteing, and is that 
which is most generally adopted by the middle and 
poorer classes in this country, being considered the' 
most economical. Its use is confined to the cooking* of 
small articles having the form of a fiat cake or slice. 
It requires merely a flat uncovered shallow pan with a 
straight handle (the usual frying-pan), in which there 
has been heated just enough of dripping or Florence oil 
to prevent the article from sticking to the bottom. 
When browned on one side the article is turned, — if it 
is a slice of meat, with a pair of tongs as in broiling ; 
if fish, a perforated tin slice is used. When a single 
article is cooked at a time, an expert cook will turn it 
by tossing it into the air and catching it on the other 
side. The pan should have a thick bottom, and be 
made of malleable iron. 

The other method of frying is performed by com- 
pletely immersing the article in hot oil or fat. In this 
case the frying-pan must be six or eight inches deep 
(a small fish-kettle answers very well), and be filled to 
the depth of three or four inches with melted dripping, 
or, for some purposes, Florence oil ; and when this is 
heated sufiiciently, the fish, or whatever it may be, is 
let gently down into it, — if large, in a wire basket by 
which it can be easily lifted out. 

This method is best adapted for the larger-sized fish , 
which may thus be cooked in good-sized pieces, or even 
whole. As soon as a large piece of fish has become 
browned, the fire ought to be moderated, and the fry- 
ing completed at a lower temperature. This will pre- 
vent the outside being over-done before the inside is 
properly cooked. It may seem singular, but it is the 
case, that in both these modes of frying, more particu- 
larly in the latter, very little, if any, of the oil or fat is 
imbibed by the food. The reason is, that the boiling 
liquid, which ought to be considerably hotter than 
boiling water, hardens and partly carbonizes the sur- 
face of whatever is placed in it, and so forms a skin or 

'• ' 



18 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

crust which is impervious to the oil. The articles thus 
treated being generally small, the heat penetrates them 
with sufficient rapidity to cook them thoroughly before 
this crust acquires any great thickness. In order more 
effectually to prevent their absorbing the oil, they are 
sometimes cojited with batter, or egg and bread crumbs, 
which very quickly set, and besides excluding the oil, 
serve in a great measure to protect the meat itself from 
the hardening^ influence of the extreme heat. 



Besides the necessary utensils above mentioned, the 
kitchen ought to be furnished with a good-sized brass 
pan for making fruit preserves, a meat saw, chopper, 
and block ; a pastry slab of hard wood, or what is better, 
of slate or marble, a rolling-pin and a paste-brush ; a 
stout pair of scissors, and several kitchen knives and 
spoons; also a number of bowls and baking dishes, tin or 
earthenware jelly moulds j a colander, a dredging box, 
and several sieves (both of hair and wire), a jelly bag 
and several tammies, pudding-cloths, towels and scrub- 
bing brushes ; a number of skewers, and some small 
boxes for holding spices, &c. None of these articles 
are very expensive, and, although a contriving house- 
wife may manage to dispense with several of them, they 
all greatly conduce to the comfort and convenience of 
the cook. Of course, the extent to which a house is 
provided with them must depend on the size of the 
establishment and the master's means. 



CHAPTER lY. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES TO BE KEPT IN YIEW IN 
EVERY PROCESS OF COOKERY. 

In order to impart a rational comprehension of these, 
it is necessary to say somewhat regarding the constitu- 
tion and nature of food. 



OF ALL COOKERY. 19 

All animal flesh consists chiefly of five different sub- 
stances. There is first the muscular Jibre, which, when 
separated from the other constituents, is white, and per- 
fectly tasteless. It is insoluble in cold water, and when 
exposed to the heat of boiling water becomes hard and 
horny. Then there are numerous membranous tissues 
which are also insoluble in cold water, but which boil- 
ing water slowly dissolves, changing them into glue or 
gelatine, which forms a jelly on cooling. Thirdly, there 
is the albumen, a substance which in raw meat remains 
dissolved in the juice, but which becomes completely 
coagulated at a temperature (about 140°), considerably 
below that of boiling water, which is 212°. Lastly, 
there exist, dissolved in the juice of raw meat, the red 
colouring matter, which coagulates and becomes brown 
at 150°, and the sapid and odorous parts of the meat, 
called the osmazome, which can only be separated from 
the water of the juice by evaporation. It is this last 
constituent in which alone the taste of the meat is to 
be found. Apart from it, the others are nearly insipid. 
Some kinds of meat become eatable when their albumen 
has been coagulated by a heat of 140°. At this stage 
flesh still retains its raw red colour, and is very juicy and 
tender. The red inside part of roast meat, so much 
liked by many individuals is an instance of it. Flesh 
may be said to be thoroughly cooked when the colour- 
ing matter also is coagulated, the temperature required 
being a little above 150°. At this stage the meat 
will have entirely lost its raw appearance, and be 
perfectly tender. If however the meat in cooking be 
heated to the boiling point, 212°, it becomes much 
firmer, from the hardening of the fibre ; and if kept 
long at that heat, tender meat will become hard if 
roasted, and tough if boiled. Should the boiling be 
continued a considerable time, the hardened fibres of 
the meat will separate, let out a great part of the juices, 
and become almost tasteless ; in fact, the meat will be 
" boiled to rags." By such a process an ignorant cook 
will profess to hoil meat tender, when she has merely 



-0 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

converted it into something resembling tow, and con- 
demned the unfortunate eater perhaps to a fit of indi- 
gestion, and most certainly to half an hour's hard la- 
bour with the toothpick. 

For cooking vegetable substances a boiling heat is 
always necessary. Their cellular tissues are softened and 
opened up by it, their starch converted from an in- 
soluble into a soluble substance, and the whole rendered 
more digestible. 

It is upon the foregoing facts that the following 
General Principles or Eules are founded : — 

Ist. In making soups, sauces, (fcc, in which only a 
strong highly-flavoured fluid extract of meat is required, 
the meat ought to be cut into very small pieces or thin 
slices, and then ve^y slowly digested in lukewarm watery 
hut not cdloived to boil until the end of the process. 
The boiling then throws up a scum, which should be 
carefully removed, and the liquor strained. 

By this process the juices of the meat are in the first 
place thoroughly extracted while still soluble, and then 
cooked by being boiled. The scum consists of the 
coagulated albumen and colouring matter, which, being 
tasteless and dirty-looking, is removed. The boiling 
also dissolves the gelatinous tissues of the meat, which 
although imparting no taste, serve to enrich and thicken 
the soup, and, if the liqour be sufficiently concentrated, 
will cause it to congeal when cooled. Of course the 
iT'.eat will have become tough and tasteless, in which 
>tate it is unfit to be eaten. If the opposite course be 
followed, — if the meat be thrown at once into boiling 
water, — the extreme heat will at once harden the sur- 
face, both by contracting the fibrine and coagulating 
the albumen ; and the latter, instead of being extracted 
in a dissolved state to be afterwards thrown lip as scum 
by boiling, will mostlij i^emain' in the meat, and there 
becoming solid, will so choke up all the minute vessels 
containing the savoury juice, as effectually to prevent 
the v^^ater entering them to extract it ; and it will only 
be by long-continued boiling that even the gelatine will 



OF ALL COOKERY. 21 

be dissolved. Thus the soup will be poor in taste, 
though rich in glue ; showing that the strength of soup 
ought not to be estimated, as is often done, by the 
firmness of the jelly it makes on cooling. 

2d. Meat which is to be eaten, ought never to be 
heated to the boiling point of water. 

From what has already been saiJ, the necessity of 
this must be evident. As a heat of 150 or 155 degrees 
is the highest required to cook meat thoroughly, every 
degree above that involves a waste of fuel ; and a boil- 
ing heat (212^), which is the greatest that can possibly 
be applied to meat boiled in an open vessel, is that at 
which it is certain to become hard and tough. 

This rule may perhaps at first sight appear to be con- 
tradicted by some of the directions given in the receipts 
which follow, but it is really not so. Thus in the di- 
rections for boiling, it is said that the meat must be 
put into hoiling water. This, however, is merely pre- 
f>aratory to cooking it, — it is done in order to seal up, 
by the boiling heat, the orifices of the juice-vessels, so 
as to prevent the water entering, and the gravy from 
flowing out. For the same purpose, meat which is to 
be stewed is first browned or sauteed in the stew-pan ; 
the main part of the cooking being in both cases done 
by slowly simmering. Neither is this rule infringed 
in frying or broiling, because these processes are ap- 
plied only to slices of meat so thin that they are 
thoroughly cooked before the extreme heat applied to 
them has time to penetrate farther than a very little 
depth from the surface. The flesh of fish is naturally 
so very soft and flaccid that it requires the hardening 
influence of a high temperature to make it palatable. 
It is therefore plunged at once into boiling water, and 
the ebulHtion kept up as briskly as possible until the 
fish is cooked. 

2>d. The third rule, which is but a deduction from the 
second, is, that large pieces of meat require cooking for 
a longer time and at a lower temperature than small 
pieces. 



09 



GENERAL TIRECTIONS 



The reason of this must be obvious ; for if a leg of 
Tuutton, for instance, were to be exposed to the heat 
required to broil or fry a beef steak, and for the same 
time, it would merely be cooked on the outside to the 
depth of half the thickness of a beef steak ; and if it 
were broiled till the part next the bone was cooked 
(which would take nearly as long as to roast it properly), 
by far the greater portion of it would be burnt almost 
to a cinder. And if, on the other hand, a beef steak 
were to be roasted precisely as a leg of mutton is, it 
would soon become as hard and dry as a tile, — not 
from being overheated, but from its moisture being all 
evaporated. 

By proper attention to rule 1st in making soups and 
meat sauces, or preparing stocX^ for either, the maximum 
of flavour and strength derivable from the quantity of 
meat employed in their preparation will always be ob- 
tained, which is the only result consistent with strict 
economy. Rules 2d and 3d, but more especially the 
former, will, if strictly followed, ensure tender and 
juicy meat, by whatever process it may be cooked. 

As nothing should be thrown aside which can in any 
way be made useful, the economical housewife will save 
both the exhausted meat from which soup has been 
made, and the liquor in which boiled meat has been 
cooked, for both of which a use may be found, as will 
afterwards be shown in its proper place. 



CHAPTER V. 

ROASTING. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

An hour previous to putting the meat to the fire, the 
grate should be well cleared of ashes, and a fire made up 
suited to the size of the joint, so that when required it 



FOR ROASTING. 23 

will be clear and glowing. Let all the cooking utensils 
be thoroughly clean and bright. Let the meat be pro- 
perly jointed, which facilitates the carving and prevents 
haggling the roast. Wash the meat well in salt and 
water, and dry it thoroughly, after which it should be 
handled as little as possible. Draw the live coal to the 
front of the grate, and put on a backing of wet cinders 
and small coal ; this will maintain and throw forward 
the heat. If the meat is very fat, which it ought not 
to be, cut off the superfluous suet, leaving only enough 
for basting, and cover it over with a piece of buttered 
white paper tied on with twine. When skewering is 
necessary, use as few skewers as possible, so as to 
avoid making too many holes in the meat by which the 
gravy escapes. Fix the joint upon the hook of the 
jack in such a way that every part may be equally 
acted on by the fire. Then hang it before the fire at 
such a distance that it will not be scorched on the out- 
side before being warmed through, and adjust the 
screen and dripping pan. As soon as the fat begins to 
melt, the joint cannot be too frequently basted with 
the dripping thus formed. In cases where the dripping 
is scanty, butter must be used for basting. If more 
dripping falls into the pan than is necessary for the 
purpose, it should be removed before it gets at all 
scorched by the heat, or by cinders falling into it. The 
time required for roasting depends on the size and 
shape of the joint as well as on the kind of meat. Al- 
though a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat is 
usually the time allowed, yet it must be noted that 
generally fat meat requires more time than lean, that 
fillets and legs take longer than loins or breasts, and 
that veal and pork take longer than any other kind of 
meat. If the roast is large and requires long cooking, 
the fire may be mended once, or perhaps twice, before 
it is finished. To do this, the roast and dripping-pan 
must be removed from the fire while the ashes are 
raked out of the front of the grate and fresh coals put 
on at the back. When the roast is nearly ready, the 



24 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

paper should be removed and the joint brought nearer 
the fire, where it should remain, being all the while 
diligently basted, until it has acquired a fine rich brown 
colour. About a quarter of an hour before removing 
the meat from the fire, sprinkle it lightly from a dred- 
ging box, with a mixture of well-dried flour and fine 
salt. When dishing the roast, remove the dripping 
from ihe gravy in the dripping pan, and put the gravy 
into the dish along with the meat. This is the best 
sauce that can be taken with any kind of roast meat, 
and if the meat be good, especially beef or mutton, 
there will be plenty of it. Should the gravy, however, 
prove scanty, the dripping pan, if it has been kept free 
from ashes, may be rinsed out with a very little boiling 
water and salt, and this poured over the meat. If ele- 
gance be desiderated, the end of the knuckle or shank- 
bone, where there is one, may be ornamented with a cut 
paper frill. All dishes and plates sent to table for hot 
joints should be well warmed. 

The flavour of the more insipid kinds of meat, such 
as veal, poultry, (fee, is frequently heightened by stuff- 
ing them with forcemeat before roasting. This is ahighly 
seasoned m^ixture of a number of savoury substances, 
for the compounding of which, from its very nature as 
a matter of taste, no definite rules can be given. In 
some of the receipts which follow, a few examples of 
stuffing are given, which merely show the substances 
usually employed, and the proportions which will be 
found very good. But it must be distinctly understood 
that the cook is by no means restricted to these, and 
ought to exercise her invention and discretion as to the 
materials and their proportions, according to circum- 
stances and the taste of those for whom she provides. 

The dripping removed from the pan during the pro- 
cess of roasting should be preserved thus : — Before it 
cools, pour it into boiling water, when all impurities, 
such as gravy, ashes, and small cinders, will fall to the 
bottom, the pure fat floating on the top. This when 
cold becomes a firm white cake. When a sufficient 



FOR ROASTING. 25 

number of such cakes are accumulated, melt them all 
together in an earthenware jar placed in boiling water, 
and on cooHng there will be a solid mass of pure white 
dripping, which will keep fresh for a considerable time. 
Beef and lamb dripping thus prepared is useful for fry- 
ing, and making pie-crust. That from mutton, being 
tallowy, is not so good, while most other kinds of drip- 
ping are never used in cookery. They should however be 
collected and preserved as above, along with fat skim- 
mings from boiled meat, broth, &c., and the accumu- 
lation sold to the candlemakers or soap-boilers. Eco- 
nomical housewifes in the country, or those who have 
a fancy for such operations, make their own candles 
and soap for common purposes from it. Either plan is 
more thrifty than throwing away refuse fat. 

Joints of meat may be very well roasted in a baker's 
oven. For this purpose the meat must be prepared as 
for roasting in usual ^\ay, and then placed upon a stout 
wire trevet in a large brown earthen pan about two 
inches deep, which will withstand the heat of the oven. 
Instead of a trevet, two or three sticks laid across the 
edges of the pan, will do to support the meat. The 
heat of the oven must be moderate, considerably less 
than is required for bread. When a small joint is 
cooked thus, it is a very good plan to bake a Yorkshire 
pudding or some potatoes in the pan under it. These 
will absorb and be enriched by the gravy of the meat, 
and are a very nice accompaniment to the roast. 



The foregoing General Directions apply to roasts of 
every kind. It now remains to point out the peculiar 
methods required for the diflferent sorts of meat. 

BEEF. 

The best piece for roasting is the Sirloin. It should 
consist of at least three of the short ribs. One weigh- 
ing about twelve pounds may require two and a half 
hours' roasting, though this depends greatly upon the 
fire. When dished, it may be garnished with finely 



26 DIRECTIONS 

scraped horse-radish, orthis may be served separately 
as a condiment (see Sauces, <fec.) Salt and mustard are 
almost universally taken with roast beef. A Yorkshire 
or a potato pudding (see Puddings) may be cooked be- 
fore the fire, under the roast. Besides these, plain 
boiled or mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, plain boiled 
rice or rice-pudding, greens, French beans, green pease, 
pease-pudding, oat-meal pudding, and suet dumplings, 
are all very good accompaniments for roast beef. 

The Bibs o/Beefmsij be roasted in the same way and 
served with the same accompaniments as the sirloin. 
Before cooking, the bones are generlly sawn through, 
about three inches from the top, and removed, leaving 
a flap, which should be folded under, and secured with 
wooden skewers. 

The Thin Jlank (called in Scotland the Nine-holes), 
boned and trimmed as for collaring (see Collared Beef), 
seasoned rather highly with pepper and salt, rolled up 
tightly and fixed with tape and small skewers, may be 
roasted as above. 

N. B. — The bones and trimmings removed from this 
and the preceding roast make excellent soup, as do also 
the remainder bones of cooked meat ; but the former 
are preferable, because being uncooked, their juices are 
more easily extracted. 

Ox Heart must be prepared for roasting thus: — Soak 
it one hour in lukewarm water to remove all the blood ; 
wash it well, and if large, placed it for ten or fifteen mi- 
nutes in boihng water. Wipe it dry, and fill the inside 
with a stuffing made of 4 ounces of bread crumbs, 
4 ounces of minced suet or butter, 2 ounces of parsley, 
and a teaspoonful each of powdered marjoram, thyme, 
and grated lemon-peel ; season to taste with pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, and make it into a stiff" paste with a 
beaten egg. Ox-heart should be thoroughly cooked. 
Currant jelly or apple sauce is sometimes served with 
it in a sauce-tureen. 

An imitation of roast hare may be made from the 
lean inside of a large sirloin, cut up, stuff'ed like hare 



Foil ROASTING. Z/ 

with a highly seasoned forcemeat, fastened with skewers 
and tape, and then roasted. 

niXTTTOM". 

The Leg or Gigot, the Shoulder, and the Loin, are 
the best parts for roasting. Before roasting the loin, 
the fat surrounding the kidneys ought to be removed, 
otherwise the dish, when the meat is cut up, will be 
flooded with melted dripping. It should likewise be 
properly jointed, for convenience in carving. The 
gravy may be eked out if necessary, as in beef, with a 
little boiling water and salt, or, if desired, a beef gravy 
may be used. 

The Neck of mutton (best end) makes a very good 
roast. It should be jointed like the loin. The Saddle, 
the Chine, and the Haunch of mutton, are respectively 
the two necks, the two loins, and the leg and loin, not 
separated. They are, however rather large for a small 
family. 

Onion, celery, and cucumber sauces are those gene- 
rally taken with roast mutton; — sometimes currant 
jelly is preferred. The vegetables to accompany roast 
mutton are generally the same as those used with roast 
beef Potatoes^browned under the roast are much liked. 

VSAZ.. 

The Fillet is'prepared for roasting as follows: — Cut 
out the bone neatly, without disfiguring the meat, and 
fill its place with a stuffing composed of bread crumbs, 
butter or finely minced suet, thyme, parsley, and minced 
or grated lemon-peel, in the same proportions as for 
ox-heart, — the whole bound together with an ^gg, and 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Fold over the 
flap so as to secure the stuffing, and fix it with skewers 
or tape; tie over the ends, with twine, pieces of buttered 
white paper. Place it rather near the fire for the first 
ten minutes, after which remove it to such a distance 
that it[will roast very slowly. As Veal ought to be 
well and thoroughly cooked, it requires a longer time 



28 



DIRECTIONS 



to roast tlian beef or mutton. If it does not yield 
enough dripping for basting, use butter. When nearly 
done, take off the paper, and allow the joint to remain 
at the fire till browned. Remove the fastenings when 
dished ; garnish with thin slices of lemon The usual 
hot water and salt poured over it will do for a gravv ; 
but thin melted butter (see receipt), to which, while 
boiling, a little mushroom ketchup or other savoury 
sauce has been added, is better. Boiled Ham is a very 
nice accompaniment to roast veal. 

The Breast, the Shoulder, the Loin, and the Neck, 
also make very good roasts. The breast and the shoul- 
der may be stuffed like the fillet. In the former, the 
stuffing must be inserted under the skin through a slit 
cut for the purpose; in the latter, it must be placed in 
a cavity formed by carefully cutting out the shoulder 
blade bone,— which is rather a difficult operation. 

X.AIKEB. 

Good young Lamb, being much smaller than mut- 
ton, is generally roasted in quarters. 

The Fore-quarter consists of the shoulder, neck, and 
breast together. The ribs of the breast should be broken 
across the middle. At table, the carver cuts off the 
shoulder first, which, if not immediately required, may 
be set aside to be used cold, the cut surface being 
first sprinkled with salt or lemon juice. 

The Hind-quarter contains the leg and loin. The 
flap of the loin may be stuffed like veal, using perhaps 
less lemon-peel and more parsley If a rich gravy be 
desired, make it from beef; if not, the usual hot water 
and salt will do. It is customary to serve mint sauce 
with roast lamb. 

The Leg, the Nech, and the Shoulder, separately make 
very good small roasts if carefully attended to ; and the 
remaining parts may be cooked in various other ways. 
Lamb; like veal, requires to be " well done." ' 



FOR ROASTING. 29 



PORK. 

Being very disagreeable when not thoroughly cooked, 
Pork should be slowly and cautiously roasted, not too 
near the fire; hence it takes a longer time than most 
other meats. 

The Leg is generally stuffed with a mixture of finely- 
chopped sage and onions, a few bread crumbs, and a 
little butter, — seasoned with pepper and salt and a small 
quantity of made mustard, and moistened with an ^gg. 
This stuffing is placed in a pouch made by cutting a 
slit in the knuckle, near the thigh, and raising the skin ; 
the opening is then sewed up with pack-thread. If the 
leg is stuffed the day previous to roasting, its flavour is 
improved. Before putting it to the fire, the skin may 
be rubbed with salad oil, which will prevent it blister- 
ing, and it should then be neatly scored across in regu- 
lar stripes about half an inch apart, to assist the carver 
in separating the slices. When the dripping is deficient, 
the roast may be basted by rubbing it with a piece 
of butter tied up in a muslin bag. Should the rind or 
" crackling " be preferred well raised or blistered, the 
joint must be drawn rather near the fire a short time be- 
fore being lifted, and then it must be carefully watched 
and diligently basted, to prevent it from being burnt. 
Apple sauce, not too sweet, is the best for roast pork. 

The Chine, the Spare-rib, the Loin, the Neck, and 
the Griskin, are all roasted in the same way as the leg. 
The Shoulder may also be roasted, but is generally 
■ rather too fat for this purpose. The stuffing for the 
chine may be the same as that for the leg, or it may be 
varied by substituting parsley and thyme for the onions. 
A short time before being removed from the fire, the 
spare rib and the griskin may be sprinkled with dry 
pulverized sage-leaves. French beans and pease-pudding 
are favourite acompaniments for roast pork. 

Sucking Pig. — This much-esteemed delicacy ought 
to be cooked as fresh as possible. The Pig, having 
been properly prepared by the butcher, must be well 



30 DIRECTIONS 

washed in cold water, and thoroughly dried. Then cut 
off the feet, and place in the inside a stuffing made of 
the crumb of a penny roll, and a few sage leaves, but- 
ter, pepper, and salt. Sew up the belly, and fasten back 
the legs with small skewers so that the under part may 
have the full benefit of the fire. Being rubbed per- 
fectly dry, it may be either dusted with flour, or smeared 
all over with white of egg applied with a feather, and 
immediately put to the fire. While it is roasting, baste 
it well with butter or salad oil. The skin ought to be 
nicely browned and crisp. It will take about two hours, 
more or less, to roast. The usual mode of serving it. 
is, to cut off the head and divide it and the body into 
halves lengthwise, to remove the brains and stuffing 
for the sauce, and to place the two halves of the body 
in the middle of the dish, and the jaws standing up on 
each side. The brains are then finely minced, and, along 
with the stuffing, mixed with hot beef gravy ; and this 
may be either added to the gravy in the dish, or served 
separately in a sauce-boat. Roast pig may also be stuffed 
like the leg of pork, and served with apple sauce. 

VENISON. 

Unless Venison be fat, roasting is by no means the 
best way to cook it. As the fat is considered a great 
delicacy, the main object of the cook must be to keep 
it from melting away, which venison fat is peculiarly 
apt to do. For this purpose the joint is generally en- 
veloped in a layer of flour-and-water paste, an inch thick, 
and this is covered with well-buttered or oiled paper. 
Thus prepared, it is placed rather near a good strong 
fire, until the paste becomes set, the paper being fre- 
quently basted with dripping to prevent its catching fire. 
It is then removed to such a distance from the fire that 
it will roast slowly. A Haunch weighing from twenty 
to twenty-five pounds will require at least three or four 
hours' roasting. It should not be overdone, as the flesh 
is naturally rather dry. About half an hour before 
the roasting is finished, the coverings may be removed, 



FOR ROASTING. 31 

and the meat placed rather nearer the jfire to brown 
it; — it must then be diligently basted with fresh butter, 
and dredged with flour and salt, like other roasts. A 
gravy may be made for it from beef or mutton, if its 
own is deficient. Sweet and acid sauces, — currant- 
jelly, or Sharp Sauce (see receipt), are usually served 
with venison. 

The roasting-pieces of venison are the same as those 
of mutton ; they are all treated as above. 

SA-RH, FAWOT, KID, and BABBIT. 

A young Hare which has been kept as long as the 
weather will permit, is the best for roasting. When 
old, it is much too tough and dry, and consequently 
does ndl make a good roast, though it will do for 
soup. When ready for roasting, cut off the feet, and 
skin it, commencing at the hind legs and drawing off 
the skin upwards to the head. Avoid tearing the ears 
in skinning them, as they are considered a dainty by 
some people. Soak and wash it well in several waters, 
and wipe it perfectly dry. Make a stuffing of the liver 
finely minced, and mixed with beef suet also minced 
very small, bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, and grated 
lemon-peel, in about the same proportions as for ox- 
heart ; season this Vv^ith pepper, salt, and nutmeg, 
moisten it with an egg and a little mushroom ketchup, 
fill the inside of the hare with it, and then sew up the 
belly. Cut the sinews of the hind legs, and fasten 
them and the fore-legs flat to the body with small 
skewers ; likewise fix the head firmly between the 
shoulders by running a skewer through it into the 
body. Hang it, head downwards, before a strong fire. 
Baste it with salted hot water till the blood ceases to 
drop from it ; then clean out the dripping-pan, and 
baste the hare with milk. When nearly done, flour it 
lightly and baste it with butter. If preferred, butter 
may be used for the basting instead of milk. An hour 
and a half to two hours' roasting will be required, but 
this depends of course upon the strength of the fire

and the size of the hare. It is dished back upward?, 
with the head erect, and served with rich beef gravy, 
and currant-jelly separate. 

It is a country fashion to stuff roast hare with a 
mixture of mashed potatoes, grated ham, suet, and 
onions, highly seasoned with pepper and allspice. 

A very young Fawn or a Kid may be roasted in the 
same way as a hare. When somewhat grown, a fawn 
may be roasted in quarters, — covered, while roasting, 
with veal or lamb caul, or slices of fat bacon, and well 
basted. 

A large Rabbit may be stuffed and roasted in the 
same way as a hare. Young rabbits and leverets need 
not be stuffed. Being smaller than hares, of course 
they take less time to roast. 

POXJ1.TRY. 

All. birds are prepared for cooking nearly in the 
same manner, as follows : — 

To pluck them, — Lay the bird upon a board with its 
head towards you, and holding it firmly with one hand, 
with the other pull out the feathers, away from you, 
in the direction in which they lie. When they are 
pulled in the contrary direction, the skin is veiy apt 
to be torn. 

To di-aw poultry, — Cut off the head ; then make a 
slit at the back of the neck, and detaching the skin 
and the crop, draw out the neck and cut it off close to 
the body, leaving the loose skin long. Make another 
incision under the tail or in the side below the leg, 
JLidt large enough to allow the gizzard to j5ass through, 
and no larger. With the finger inserted through this, 
carefully detach all the intestines, and then, squeezing 
the bird, draw the whole gently out at the opening. In 
doing this, great care must be taken to avoid breaking 
the gall bladder and the gut which joins the gizzard, 
because otherwise it will be impossible to remove the 
bitter taste imparted by the contents of the one, or 
the srrittiness derived from the other. In fowl^i, tur-

keys, and geese, break the legs by the middle of the 
first joint, and draw out the sinews (this ought to be 
particularly attended to if the bird is not young), cut- 
ting off the parts at the joint. Press down the breast- 
bone ; — if the bird is large, this must be done by lay- 
ing it breast upwards upon the dresser, and having 
covered it with a thickly-folded cloth, beating it with 
the rolling-pin. [The foregoing operations are properly 
the jjoulterer's work, and the housewife will save her- 
self much trouble by making sure that he does it before 
sending home her purchases.] It must then be singed 
all over with a piece of lighted paper held under it, to 
remove the small hairs left after plucking it. The bird 
being now washed and thoroughly dried, is ready for 
trussing. This varies with the kind of bird, and mode 
of cooking. In every case the skewers and strings used 
must be removed before serving, and the bird dished 
with its breast upwards. 

A Fowl prepared as above is trussed thus : — Press 
down the legs close to the sides and back, and fix them 
by means of a skewer thrust through the thighs and the 
body. Place the liver and gizzard, — the latter split 
open, and both clean washed and dried, — one under 
each wing, and twist the pinion ends round upon the 
back. Fasten the wings close to the sides, by a skewer 
run through the joints and the body. The legs and 
wings may be farther secured by pieces of twine tied 
over them round the bird. 

When ready to put to the fire, place inside the fowl 
a piece of butter about the size of a walnut, well rolled 
in a mixture of pepper and salt, and tie up the skin of 
the neck. Hang it before the fire neck downwards, 
and baste it frequently with fresh butter. It will be 
roasted in from half an hour to an hour, according to 
the size of fowl and the strength of the fire. Large 
fowls mtiy be stuffed like turkeys. (See next page.) 

The sauce for roast fowl may be either plain melted 
butter, or gravy sauce, or, what is still better, a sauce 
made as follows : — Cut the neck in pieces, and stev^ it 

D 



34 DIRECTIONS 

gently till its juice is extracted ; — then take out the 
pieces, strain the liquor, stir into it a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, add some mushroom ketchup, and boil 
it for half a minute. 

TarJceys are trussed in the same manner as fowls, 
only using one or two more skewers if required. The 
stuffing for roast turkey is generally the same as for 
fillet of veal (see p. 27); to which may be added, if de- 
sired, parboiled sausage meat, grated ham, or chopped 
oysters. This is placed under the skin at the neck, 
which must be well secured, leaving room, however, for 
the stuffing to swell. The breast ought to be covered 
with writing paper, well buttered, and the roasting done 
before a good large fire, — not too near. Shortly before 
taking it away from the fire, remove the paper, shift 
the turkey closer to the fire to become browned ; dust 
it with flour, and baste it with butter to prevent its 
getting scorched. A sauce may be made from the neck, 
as for fowls — (see p. 33.) Bread sauce, gravy sauce, 
oyster sauce, and egg sauce, are also occasionally used. 

Pigeons are roasted with the feet on, one leg being 
thrust through a slit made in the other. They are 
stuffed with the liver minced and mixed with bread- 
crumbs, chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and a little 
butter. Half an hour's roasting is sufficient, during 
which they must be well basted with butter. The sauce 
for roast pigeons may be either plain melted butter 
with a little chopped parsley in it, or one made as above 
from the giblets — (the neck, liver, and gizzard.) They 
are sometimes served with toasted bread beneath them 
in the dish, and with bread sauce. They may also be 
garnished with fried bread crumbs. 

Partridges are roasted Avith both the head and the 
feet left on. The neck is twisted round the wing so as 
to bring the head to the side of the breast. Otherwise 
they are prepared and trussed in the same manner as 
fowls, only their feet are made to cross on the lower 
part of the breast. While roasting, baste them with 
butter ; and when nearly cooked, dredge them lightly 



FOR ROASTING. 35 

with flour, and continue to baste till they are browned 
They are served on toasted bread soaked in the con- 
tents of the dripping pan. The sauce may be either 
plain melted butter or beef gravy. 

Pheasants, Grouse, and Blackcocks, are roasted and 
served in the same manner. So also are Woodcocks 
and Snipes, but these latter are generally not drawn ; 
the trail, as the drippings from the entrails are called, 
being received upon toasted bread placed in the drip- 
ping pan beneath. This is considered a delicacy, and 
is served in the dish under the bird. 

Goose. This is best drawn at an incision made be- 
tween the vent and the tail. The legs and wings are 
lopped at the first joint, and the remaining parts 
skewered flat to the sides. The liver and gizzard are 
not usually roasted along with it, but are reserved, along 
with the head, neck, feet, and pinions, for a stew or a 
giblet pie. A mixture of chopped onions and sage- 
leaves (six of each will do), jmd a little butter, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and a little sugar, is 
placed inside the bird, through the opening by which 
it was drawn. A button-hole is then made in the skin 
of the belly, or apron as it is called, by cutting out the 
vent, and into this, the apron being pulled downwards, 
the rump or croup is inserted as a button. The neck- 
skin being then securely tied, a piece of buttered 
paper is tied over the breast, and the goose hung before 
the fire. In a short time remove the paper, and baste 
the goose with its own dripping, of which there will 
generally be sufiicient. Being naturally greasy, it does 
not need so much basting as turkey or fowl. It re- 
quires thorough cooking, which will be accomplished 
in about two hours, more or less. Serve it with beef 
gravy if required. Apple sauce is the prescriptive ac- 
companiment of roast goose. 

The above stuffing is thought by some to be improved 
by being stewed in butter till tender, and then placed 
inside the goose whilst hot. It is sometimes varied by 
the addition of the liver chopped, and bread crumbs, or 



36 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

boiled rice, or mashed potatoes, or a mixture of potatoes 
and apples (previously cooked and reduced to a pulp), 
or sometimes even roasted chesnuts cut small 

Bucks. The feet, which are left on, are scalded in 
boiling water, and then skinned. They are turned 
flat upon the back like the wings. Otherwise, ducks 
are prepared in the same wity as geese, the liver being 
used in the stuffing. Being smaller, they require less 
time to roast. A gravy may be made for them, as for 
fowls, from the giblets. Apple sauce is served with 
them. Some prefer them plain roasted like fowls, 
without stuffing ; in which case the apple sauce may 
also be omitted. Green pease are usually served with 
roast ducks. 



CHAPTER VI. 
BOILING. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

The practice of this most important branch of the 
culinary art seems at first sight so simple and easy, 
that any general directions for it may perhaps appear 
unnecessary. Yet it is doubtless this apparent sim- 
plicity v/hich has led to its being generally so ill done, 
that, excepting for the larger prime joints, it is com- 
paratively neglected by all who can afford to purchase 
roasting pieces. 

The two grand errors which prevail on the subject 
of boiling fresh meat are — Isf, Putting it into cold 
water, and gradually heating it to the boiling point ; 
and 2fZ, Maintaining it in a state of brisk ebullition 
until cooked. The former of these is almost universal, 
being actually recommended in most cookery books. 
The latter is an error generally acknowledged, although 
it is too frequently committed through inattention or 
ignorance. When these errors are considered in con- 
nection with what has been said in Chapter IV. on the 



FOR BOILING. 37 

chemical nature of animal flesh, their necessary results 
will be evident ; and these are fully confirmed by ex- 
perience. The evil arising from the first error, is the 
loss of the juice and the flavour of the meat. The juice 
being entirely soluble in water below 1 40o, as soon as 
the meat is immersed in it, there begins a gradual pro- 
cess of transposition between the juice of the meat and 
the water, and this goes on until cheeked by the co- 
agulation of the albumen within the meat, which takes 
place when it has attained the above-mentioned tem- 
perature. But by this time, especially if the fire has 
been slow, the meat will have lost a great part of its 
savoury juice, of which the scum which now rises is 
the albumen, and what remains has been rendered thin 
and watery. Now commences error the second. The 
heat increases, — the water simmers, — it boils fast. The 
muscular fibre of the meat soon begins to contract, — 
it forcibly presses upon the imprisoned fluid ; the co- 
agulated albumen confining it, having been rendered 
less tenacious by previous dilution with water, gives 
way^ and the remaining juice gushes out at every pore. 
The meat is now considered to be well cooked. It may 
perhaps be found tolerably tender, but it will be both dry 
and tasteless. A few minutes more boiling would have 
made it tough as well. These results are not so observ- 
able in large pieces of meat, more especially those which 
like a leg of mutton have the greater portion of their 
surface covered by the natural skin, because from their 
size it is possible to make the water boil before it has 
time to penetrate very deeply, while the skin greatly 
helps to keep in the juice. Smaller pieces, on the con- 
trary, which have a proportionally larger raw or cut 
surface, are sure to lose almost all their juice when thus 
treated. Of course the liquor in which meat has been 
thus boiled will make excellent broth or soup, as perhaps 
every housewife knows ; but since well-flavoured, tender 
and juicy meat, and not broth or soup, is the main 
object in boiling meat, a very difl^erent course ought to 
be followed. 



38 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

The meat should he plunged at once into water boil- 
ing briskly over a strong fire. The water should be 
slightly salted, and be in sufficient quantity to cover the 
meat. The boiling heat will at once coagulate the al- 
bumen, and harden the fibrine at the surface of the meat, 
and so, from the first, the escape and dilution of the juice 
is checked. After the lapse of from five to ten minutes, 
according to the size and compactness of the piece of 
meat, the heat must be reduced considerably below the 
boiling point, by the addition of cold water. The fire 
may then be moderated, and the pot so placed that the 
meat will never afterwards be subjected to a greater 
heat than that of gentle simmering. Should any scum 
be formed, it must be removed. Keep the pot covered 
to prevent dust and smoke entering it. If the quantity 
of water becomes much reduced by evaporation, the pot 
must be replenished with hot water. When vegetables, 
such as carrots or turnips, are boiled along with meat, 
they are sliced and put in when the meat is nearly 
cooked, after which the water m.ay be allowed to boil, 
but no longer than is just necessary to cook the vege- 
tables. As this cannot be done, however, without some 
risk of impairing the goodness of the meat, it is safer 
to boil the vegetables separately. Some cooks recom- 
mend wrapping the meat up tightly in a floured cloth. 
But although this practice may perhaps assist in pre- 
serving the juice when the meat is put on in cold water, 
still it gives it a disagreeable blanched appearance, and 
it will not be found necessary when the meat is put 
into boiling water at first. The liquor in which meat 
has been boiled properly, although not so rich in juice 
as that in which it has been boiled improperly, will still 
make very good soup, with the addition of trimmings 
and scraps of meat, raw or cooked meat bones, &c. As 
all varieties of fresh meat are boiled as directed above, 
little more will be requisite than to enumerate the best 
joints and pieces for the purpose ; although it must be 
understood that atiy piece of meat of moderate size and 
compact shape will be very good boiled, if the above 
directions are carefully attended to. 



FOR BOILING. 39 

Salted meat which has lain long in pickle (more 
particularly tongue and ham) is an exception to the 
foregoing rule. It is best put into cold water. Not 
onlj so, but it frequently requires to be soaked for hours 
in cold water previous to being boiled, both to extract 
the superabundance of salt, and to impart moisture suf- 
ficient to replace what was extracted in the process of 
salting, as well as what has dried up aftenvards. No 
doubt much of the savoury juice of the meat is thus 
extracted, but this cannot be helped, and is not of so 
much consequence, since its absence is disguised by the 
saltness. Beef which has been but a short time in salt, 
especially if it be a small piece, may very safely be put 
on in boiling water, and is much better so cooked. 

The time required to cook boiled meat depends, of 
course, on its weight and compactness of shape. Gene- 
rally, from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes for 
each pound is sufficient. In lifting meat out of the 
pot, care should be taken to avoid thrusting the fork 
into any fleshy part, as, in some joints, this would make 
unseemly holes, by which much of the gravy would es- 
cape before it could be brought to table» Perhaps it 
may hardly be necessary to remark that all vessels used 
for boiling ought to be perfectly clean. 

BEEF. 

Boiled Fresh Beef or Bouilli is not so generally liked 
as it ought to be. This is probably owing to the dry, 
tasteless condition in which, through ignorant cold- 
water cooking, it is generally presented at table. The 
want of the juice in the meat is but ill supplied by its 
being served in a flood of the watery liquor in which it 
was boiled, — by way of gravy. When the broth is re- 
quired on the same day as the meat, which is the ge- 
neral custom, the following is the best plan to adopt. 

Procure from four to six pounds of the rump or bris- 
ket of beef, — almost any part will do if it is good and 
tender, — and cut about one quarter of this into thin 
slices, choosing for this purpose any sinewy or loose out- 



40 DIRECTIONS 

side parts, so as to leave the remainder of a solid com- 
pact shape. Having Avell hacked and scored these slices 
across, put them on in as much cold water as is intended 
be employed (rather less than a quart to each pound 
of the whole meat will do), and let them heat very slowly 
to extract the juice. When this is thoroughly accom- 
plished, add salt to taste, skim the liquor, and then make 
it boil. While boiling fast, put in the rest of the meat, 
together with some sliced carrot, turnip, onions, and 
leeks, and proceed as directed above. When the meat 
is nearly cooked, take it out for a short time while the 
vegetables are boiled. Allow it to go off the boil again, 
replace the meat, and let it simmer for a few minutes. 
Dish half the carrots and turnips round the meat, along 
witli some of the liquor, and put the rest of the vege- 
tables, cut smaller, into the tureen along with the broth, 
to which toasted bread cut into small dice may be added 
if desired. Before sending to table, skim the superflu- 
ous fat from the broth. Of course, the exhausted slices 
of meat must not be sent to table in their present state. 
The quantity of vegetables used must depend on the 
taste of the cook ; — three large carrots, four turnips, 
two large leeks, and three onions, to six pounds of meat, 
is a very good proportion. When the broth is not re- 
quired on the same day, the meat may be cooked entire, 
proceeding exactly according to the foregoing General 
Directions, but not omitting the vegetables. The French 
pot au feu, in which they make their bouilli, is of stone- 
ware, which has the advantage of maintaining a more 
equable temperature, losing less heat by radiation than 
an iron vessel does, and consequently requiring a smaller 
consumption of fuel. 

Salted Beef, with its appropriate vegetables, is a 
much more general favourite than the bouilli ; and of 
all the pieces which may be used, the Round is the most 
approved. A whole round, being generally too large 
to boil at one time for a small household, may be di- 
vided, so as to give each piece its due proportion of fat, 
into two, or even three pieces, and these boiled at sepa- 



FOR BOILING. 41 

rate times. When the whole is boiled at once,, the bone 
may be cut out. Wash the meat well, and if it is too 
salt, it may require steeping in several waters till fresh- 
ened. Fasten the folds of it firmly together with skewers 
and strong broad tape or strips of linen, and then put 
it on the fire in water sufiicient to cover it. If the meat 
is but newly salted, the water should be hoiling ; if it 
is rather salt, cold water is better. In the former case, 
proceed exactly as with fresh meat ; in the latter, heat 
the meat gradually till it begins to boil, after which, keep 
it slowly simmering till cooked. The time required is 
about a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat. 

The vegetables taken along with salt beef (carrot, tur- 
nip, and greens) ure always best boiled in some of the 
same liquor, which must be removed for this purpose 
after the meat has simmered about two hours — of course 
leaving enough to keep the meat covered. The vege- 
tables may be farther enriched by adding the fat skim- 
mings of the meat to their liquor. When the vegetables 
are cooked in the same pot with the meat, there is al- 
ways a risk either of having the former under-done, or 
the latter over-done, unless the meat is removed while 
the vegetables are boiled. 

The beef, freed from its fastenings, is dished along 
with some of the liquor, and garnished with the carrot 
and turnip. (Some omit the turnip.) The greens are 
served separately. The liquor is excellent for making 
peas-soup. 

A round of beef is very good cold, and will keep 
good for a fortnight in cold weather. It should be kept 
covered with a soft clean cloth thickly folded, and a 
dish-cover over that. When not intended to be used 
warm, it is a good plan to cool it as rapidly as possible 
by plunging it into iced or cold spring water before re- 
moving the fastenings — changing the water frequently. 
This congeals the gelatine and fat on the surface, and 
so preserves the juice, which is very apt to drain out 
when it cools slowly. 

The salted Eihs, Brisket, and Edge-hone, are also 



42 DIRECTIONS 

cooked and served as above ; only, being less solid, they 
are done in about five-sixths of the time for the same 
weight. 

Collared 6e(?/'and Pressed heef^ prepared according to 
receipts, are cooked in the same way ; only, being bound 
up in a compact shape, they require a rather longer time 
to cook. Though collared beef may be served hot, like 
other salt beef, yet these are generally preferred cold, 
a weight being placed upon them while cooling, in 
order to make them firm and compact for slicing. 

A Pickled Ox-tongue is put on in plenty of cold water 
" brought to the boil," and then simmered till tender, 
which is ascertained by probing it in the thickest part 
with a fork. A dried tongue requires twenty- four hours 
previous soaking, more or less, according to dryness and 
saltness. Salt tongue is generally eaten along with the 
more insipid meats, such as veal, poultry, &c. It should 
be skinned before serving. 

Tripe should be chosen fat, thick, and white. It 
requires very careful washing and scraping, scalding it 
frequently, and changing the water often. It will take 
from six to nine hours, or even longer, slow simmering, 
according to the age of the animal from which it was 
taken. When perfectly tender, remove it from the 
liquor, cut it into pieces of a convenient size for helping 
at table, and then simmer it in milk and water, along 
with some young onions previously parboiled. When 
the milk and water begins to thicken, add some arrow- 
root mixed with a little cold water, or a piece of butter 
rolled in flour, season with pepper and salt, and, if liked, 
a little made mustard, — and serve in a hash dish or small 
tureen. 

This makes an excellent supper dish, along with boiled 
potatoes. Some people use a little of its own liquor 
instead of the milk and water, but the latter will be 
found much preferable. Tripe may be bought ready 
cooked at the cook-shops, but the last preparation with 
milk and water is best done at home. 

Cow-keels or Ox feet should be procured ready cleaned. 



FOR BOILING. 43 

They are considered very nutritious when thoroughly 
cooked. They should be simmered till the bones be- . 
come loosened, and served hot with plain parsley sauce 
poured over them, or plain melted butter with a tea- 
spoonful of made mustard and a very little vinegar or 
lemon juice in it. 

Cow-heel, while cooking, yields a very rich oil, which 
must be skimmed off. This is sometimes used for fry- 
ing and basting. It burns well in a lamp, and is said to 
be used by the perfumers in some of their preparations 
for the hair. The liquor may be turned to account in 
making calves-foot jelly ; — for which ox feet are much 
better adapted than calves' feet. 

MXTTTON. 

The Leg or Gigot is the prime joint for boiling. Cut 
the end off the knuckle, and cook the leg, according to 
the General Directions, in an oval vessel or fish kettle. 
Boiled turnips and carrots in slices are usually served 
in the same dish with boiled mutton ; or the turnips 
may be mashed, and served separately. When cooked 
in the same pan, these are put in to boil half an hour 
before the mutton is done, the meat being meanwhile 
removed and replaced when the vegetables have become 
soft. The liquor should be reserved for making broth 
next day. 

The Neck of mutton, and the Back Ribs, are boiled 
in the same way as the leg. It is a very good family 
practice to make broth at the same time, as the in- 
gredients do not at all spoil the meat. For this pur- 
pose the barley or rice is put into the boiling water along 
with the meat. After an hour and a half's simmering, 
the meat is removed and covered up to be kept warm, 
while the vegetables in small slices (carrots, turnips, 
and onions, with chopped parsley, and celery or celery- 
seed) are put in and the liquor boiled till considerably 
reduced in quantity. The meat is then replaced, and 
the cooking finished in the usual way. Some of the 
carrots and turnips may be kept in large slices with 



44 DIRECTIONS 

which to garnish the meat when dished. Cauliflower 
may be served with boiled mutton. Caper or gherkin 
sauce may either be poured over it in the dish, or 
served separately in a sauce-boat. Parsley-sauce poured 
over the meat is by some preferred to caper sauce. 

VE AZ.. 

The parts most usually boiled are the Chump of the 
Loin, the Best End of the Neck, and the Knuckle. These 
require to be thoroughly cooked. Thick parsley-sauce 
may be poured over them or served separately ; onion 
sauce is also used. These insipid gelatinous meats are 
much the better of an accompaniment of boiled salt 
tongue, ham, or bacon. The liquor of boiled veal makes 
a very delicate broth, rice in gelatine. 

Z.AMB. 

The Leg is treated in the same way as a leg of mutton, 
but being smaller, it does not require so long a time to 
cook. It may be dished with spinach under it ; or the 
loin (being the remainder of the hind quarter) may be 
cut into chops, and these fried and served in the dish 
round the leg. Plain melted butter, and parsley sauce, 
are the sauces generally used. 

FORK. 

Pork should be thoroughly cooked, and ought pre- 
viously to have lain in salt from two days to a week at 
the least, according to the size of the piece. The I^eg 
of pork should be placed in the pot with the skin-side 
uppermost, and with a plate underneath it to prevent its 
sticking to the bottom. While simmering, it throws up 
a great deal of fat, which should be constantly skimmed 
off. It is served with pease-pudding boiled in some of 
the liquor, greens, mashed turnips, or parsnips. 

Pickled Pork is cooked and served in the same man- 
ner. The following is a pleasant variation in the mode 
of serving a Pig^s Cheek (pickled.) While the cheek is 
being cooked, boil for half an hour half a pint of split 



FOR BOILING. 45 

peas loosely tied in a cloth ; remove them from the 
cloth, mash, and pass them through a hair sieve ; sea- 
son them with pepper and salt, and add an ounce of 
butter and four beaten eggs ; place them in a stew-pan 
over the fire, and keep stirring till the eggs begin to 
set ; then, when the pig's cheek, cooked till perfectly 
tender, is dished, spread the peas over it, sprinkle the 
top with bread crumbs, and brown it before the fire. It 
should be served immediately. The liquor of boiled 
pork, if not too salt, will do very well to make peas- 
soup, but does not answer for anything else. 

Ram. A ham may be boiled either whole or in parts 
The best English hams are fromYork andWestmoreland. 
A most important point in cooking ham is the soaking, 
the length of time required for which (from ten hours 
to three or four days) must be properly proportioned to 
the saltness and dryness of the ham. Before cooking 
it, the ham should be well scraped and washed in warm 
water, and any yellow or rusty parts pared off". It should 
be put on in cold water, allowed slowly to reach the boil- 
ing point, and then simmered from tw^o to four hours 
according to size, frequently skimming off the flit which 
continually rises. When done, skin it neatly and strew 
over it a few bread raspings mixed with a little brown 
sugar j then place it before the fire to dry and become 
browned. Serve it garnished with parsley, and with a 
paper frill fastened round the knuckle. When eaten 
hot, it is generally as a relish with other meats. Boiled 
ham will keep even longer than a round of beef, and is 
a most serviceable article to have in the house. It 
should be kept covered with the skin, which must be 
preserved whole for this purpose when taken off. 

Bacon, well streaked, and not too fat, should be put 
on in cold water and simmered for an hour and a half, 
more or less, according to its size. It is served with 
broad beans round it, or young peas when in season. 



Rahhits. These may be boiled whole as follows. Wash 
them well in warm water, and dry them. Fill the belly 



46 DIRECTIONS 

with a stuffing made of bread crumbs, suet, parsley, and 
onions, all chopped small, seasoned with pepper and suit, 
and bound together with an egg and a little milk. Sew 
up the bellv, truss in the same way as roast hare, and 
simmer gently for an hour. When dished, pour over 
them a sauce made of milk and onions thickened over 
the fire with a paste of butter and flour, and seasoned 
with pepper and salt ; — the onions being previously 
boiled in water till tender. This dish is called rabbits 
smothered in onions. The stuffing, if not desired, may 
be omitted. When two are prepared in this way, they 
are dished with the head of one rabbit laid to the tail 
of the other. Instead of the onion sauce, a sauce made 
of some of the liquor in which the rabbits were boiled, 
enriched with veal gravy, and the livers boiled and 
mashed, — thickened with flour and butter, — and sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, allspice, and finely chopped 
parsley, may be poured over the rabbits. 



Fowls and Turkei/s which have been plucked, drawn, 
and cleaned in the same way as for roasting, are trussed 
for boiling as follows. The legs are secured by being 
drawn inside under the skin. The pinions are turned 
round upon the back, the liver being placed under one, 
and the gizzard under the other. The legs and wing* 
may be farther held down by strings tied over them 
round the body. Boiled turkey is always, and boiled 
fowl frequently, stufl"ed. The following is the mixture 
usually employed : bread crumbs, finely minced, suet 
and parsley, with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. This is 
moistened with an eg^ and a little milk, and placed in 
the breast ; and the skin is then sewed over upon the 
back, leaving sufficient room for the stuffing to swell. 
The bird is put on in water nearly boiling, and in 
sufficient quantity to keep it always covered. Fowls 
require to be simmered from half an hour to an hour 
and a half, and turkeys about double that time, accord- 
ing to their size and age : in all cases they should be 
thoroughly cooked, as nothing is more disagreeable than 



FOR BOILING. 47 

half-raw poultry. If it is desired that the bird should 
look very white, it may be wrapt in a floured cloth, 
before boiling; or simply rubbed with lemon juice, 
which answers the same purpose. The liquor will make 
excellent broth. This may be prepared for use the 
same day, the vegetables and some scraps of veal or 
mutton being put in along with the fowl, which will 
not be any the worse for them. Various sauces may 
be used : — egg sauce, parsley sauce, to which the liver 
boiled and bruised may be added if liked, celery sauce, 
lemon sauce, and sometimes, for turkey, oyster sauce. 
When this last is selected, a few chopped oysters may 
be added to the stuffing. For turkey some people like 
a sweet stuffing made by substituting currants and a 
little sugar for the parsley. Boiled poultry, either hot 
or cold, is always more palatable if ham or salt tongue 
is eaten along with it. Several excellent made-dishes 
can be prepared from the cold remains of roast or 
boiled poultry. (See Chapter X.) 

Geese, Ducks, ^ndGame Birds, are much better roasted 
than boiled. For boiling they are trussed in the same 
way as fowls. The sauce generally preferred for Geese 
and Ducks is onion sauce. Partridges, Pheasants, (fcc. 
are served with the same sauces as when roasted. 

FISH. 

The flesh of fish is naturally so soft that it requires 
to be cooked at a boiling heat in order to make it firm. 
Being generally small in size as compared with joints of 
meat, it is proportionally more quickly cooked ; and the 
texture of the muscular tissues is so loose, and the gela- 
tinous parts are so easily dissolved„that every minute it 
remains in the liquor after being thoroughly done dete- 
riorates its quality. On the other hand, few things are 
so nauseous as underdone fish. Hence it is a matter of 
some nicety, to be learnt only by experience, to pro- 
portion the time of cooking to the size of the fish. As 
there is some danger, when the fish or piece of fish is 
large and thick, of its being over-cooked on the outside 



48 DIRECTIONS 

before the interior is done, the safer plan in such cases 
is to proceed as directed for boiling butcher meat, viz. 
to plunge it at once into boiling water, and then to cool 
it down so far by the addition of cold water as to allow 
the interior time to become heated before the outside 
is too much cooked. Smaller fish however are best kept 
at the boiling heat from the moment they enter the fish- 
kettle till they are done, — the object being in all cases 
to perform the operation as rapidly as is consistent with 
its being done thoroughly. 

Hard water is the best for boiling fish in. It should 
have plenty of salt in it, and a little vinegar is sometimes 
an improvement. This assists the rapid coagulation of 
the albumen, which, in the case of fish, forms the curd 
which is deposited between the flakes, and is esteemed 
a delicacy. The cruel practice of crimping cod and 
salmon — that is, gashing their sides while yet alive — oc- 
casions a more copious formation of this curd upon the 
cut surfaces ; as the juice of the fish oozes out over them 
and thickens by evaporation, so that it is coagulated 
there and not within the substance of the fish, when it is 
plunged into the boiling water. The crimping also fa- 
cilitates the rapidity of the cooking by admitting the 
boiling water to act upon the interior parts of the fish. 
This however may, if desired, be equally well effected by 
cutting the fish in slices before putting it on. All fish 
require thorough cleaning before being cooked ; care 
being taken, in gutting them, to avoid breaking the 
entrails, especially the gall-bladder, on account of the 
bad taste their contents communicate to the fish. The 
fins and thin part of the tail should be clipped off with 
scissors, and the eyes of the larger sorts taken out. 

Every kind of fish becomes so fragile when cooked, 
that great care is required in dishing it, to prevent its 
being broken or disfigured : on this account the use of 
the drainer should never be omitted. If the fish hap- 
pen to be ready before the time for serving it, it must 
on no account be allowed to remain in the water, but 
must be dished, covered with a cloth and dish-cover, and 
kept hot over the fish-kettle. 



FOR BOILING. 49 

Fish should be sent to table as dn/ as possible, with 
a folded napkin under it in the dish. Besides the 
sauces commonly used, many people take some of the 
liquor in which it was boiled. A sauce-tureen of this 
may accordingly be sent to table along with it. Vine- 
gar, ketchup, essence of anchovies, pepper, and cayenne, 
are usual condiments, and some people also use mus- 
tard. 

Salmon is best when perfectly fresh. It will however 
keep good for two or three days if kept very cool, or 
packed in ice. It should be well cleaned out, scaled and 
washed, and boiled in plenty of salted water. For large 
full-grown fish when boiled whole, the time required 
may be about six minutes to each pound weight. It 
is best however boiled in pieces, the larger and thicker 
portions being put in first and boiled longest. When 
done, let it remain for a minute or two upon the 
drainer placed across the top of the fish-kettle, in order 
to let the water drip from it, and then dish the pieces 
together in their natural position, with a napkin under 
them. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. Serve 
with either lobster sauce, shrimp sauce, parsley sauce, 
or plain melted butter, — not omitting, however, a 
sauce-tureen with some of the fish-liquor ^or those who 
prefer it. T routs are dressed whole, and served in the 
same manner. 

Cod. This fish, especially the tail part, is the better 
of lying for a day or two in salt before cooking ; and 
before salting, it must be perfectly cleaned. It is boiled 
as directed above for salmon, garnished with its roe, and 
served with oyster sauce or melted butter. Thehead- 
and-shoulders part is frequently, before being served, 
brushed over with egg, sprinkled with bread crutnbs, 
pepper and salt, stuck over with bits of butter, and 
browned before the fire. 

Haddocks and Whitings, after being well scraped and 
cleaned, are put into boiling water well salted, and kept 
briskly boiling till done ; which will be in about twenty- 
five minutes, more or less, according to size. If they 

E 



50 DIRECTIONS 

are of different sizes, the large should be put in first- 
The heads are by some people esteemed a delicacy. 
Serve with melted butter and some of the liquor. 

Herrings and Mackarel are boiled in the same way, 
but not so long. Sauce, — plain melted butter ; or, for 
mackarel, fennel sauce or green gooseberry sauce. 

Turhot, Hallibut, Brill, and Soles. These fish require 
careful cleaning and rubbing with salt, to remove the 
slime which exudes from them. Cut an incision in the 
back, to give room for the fish to swell without bursting 
the breast skin. Lay it breast upwards on the fish 
drainer, and cook it in plenty of water into which has 
been thrown a handful of salt and a cupful of vinegar. 
As the skin of turbot is very apt to break and become 
unsightly under a brisk ebullition, this fish is merely 
simmered . Dish it breast upwards, garnished either 
with any small fish fried, or with parsley. Sauce, melted 
butter or any fish sauce that may preferred. 

Skate. This is the better of hanging for a day or two 
in the open air. It should previously be cleaned thorough- 
ly, rubbed with salt, and have the tail and fins cut off. 
When to be boiled, skin it on both sides, and cut it 
lengthways in strips an inch and a half broad ; roll up 
each piece aijd tie it with thread. Then steep them for 
three hours in a pickle of salt, vinegar, and water; 
after which boil them for about fifteen minutes in salt 
and water. Before serving, remove the threads, and 
serve with melted butter or caper sauce, to which may 
be added, if liked, some of the liver boiled and bruised. 

Salted Cod and Ling. The black-skinned sort are 
said to be the best. Like salt meat, salt fish requires 
steeping till freshened. It should be put on the fire in 
cold fresh water and simmered till tender, — not boiled, 
as that would make it hard and thready. Dish it dry 
with a napkin underneath, garnished with plain boiled 
parsnips and parsley. Egg sauce is the appropriate 
sauce. Mustard is generally taken with salt cod. 

Salt and Red Herrings sometimes require steeping 
before being boiled. Serve with mashed potatoes.

Soft water is the best for boiling vegetables, and there 
should be plenty of it used for all vegetables except 
green peas and young spinach, the flavour of which 
would be to much weakened by a large quantity. With 
few exceptions they ought to be put on in boiling water 
and boiled till thoroughly tender. The colour of every 
kind of cabbage and greens will be better preserved by 
the addition of a very small quantity of carbonate of 
soda to the water. The time required for boiling vege- 
tables depends so entirely upon their age and size, that 
no definite directions can be given about it. The best 
way to ascertain when they are done is to feel if they 
are tender by running a fork into them. All vegetables 
should be thoroughly washed and freed from dirt and 
insects before boiling. 

Potatoes are best boiled in their skins. Being first 
well washed and cleaned, they are put on the fire in 
cold water enough to cover them, seasoned with salt. 
They must not be allowed to boil too soon or too fast, 
else they will be done on the outside, and their skins 
will be burst before the inside is cooked. This is a 
frequent error, and ought to be carefully avoided, for 
few things are so tantalizing as fine-looking mealy po- 
tatoes with raw hearts. They should be as nearly as 
possible all of one size (which may be contrived by sort- 
ing the stock laid in into two or three lots, according to 
size, and boiling those of each lot separately), so that 
that they may be all equally cooked ; otherwise, by the 
time the large ones are done, the smallest will perhaps 
be broken and dissolved. When sufficiently cooked, 
pour the water off them, and place them at the side of 
the fire with the lid half off to let the steam escape, so 
that they may dry. Before serving, peel them, first re- 
moving the eyes with the point of a small knife so as 
not to disfigure them. When sent to table, cover them 
with a large white napkin folded, in preference to a 
dish-cover, because it will keep them as hot, and not 



52 DIRECTIONS 

confine the steam, which spoils the potatoes. Old po- 
tatoes are sometimes the better of being- pared and 
soaked some time in cold water before boiling. When 
to be mashed, they may be pared either before or after 
being boiled, — carefully removing the eyes and specks. 
After being thoroughly boiled, they are mashed so as to 
leave no lumps, adding some butter, a very little milk, 
salt and white pepper. Dish neatly in a warmed vege- 
table dish, score in diamonds on the top, and if desired, 
brown before the fire. 

- Turnips. Young ones ought to be peeled, not pared, 
put on in plenty of boiling water with salt in it, and 
boiled till tender. Older turnips must be pared, taking 
off all the woody outside, sliced as required, and boiled 
as above. When cooked, drain the water thoroughly 
from them, dish them, and pour some melted butter 
over them. Turnips may be mashed after being drained. 
Press them through a colander with a wooden spoon, 
to keep back all lum.ps, and re-warm them in the sauce- 
pan, stirring in some fresh butter ; season with salt, 
pepper, and a little powdered ginger. Dish them neatly, 
ornamenting the top with a diamond pattern. — Young 
turnips are never mashed. 

Carrots and Parsnips should be well washed and 
scraped, and boiled like turnips till soft. Young ones 
may be served whole, but large ones must be cut in 
quarters lengthwise. They are served with boiled meat 
either as a separate dish or as a garnishing. Parsnips 
are sometimes mashed like turnips. 

Beetroot may also be used for the same purposes, but 
it must merely be washed, and not cut up till after 
being boiled, else it will lose its fine colour. 

Greens, Cabbages, and Savoys must be v/ell washed, 
the coarse outside blades removed, the stalk cut off' 
close to the bottom, and all dirt and insects carefully 
removed from between the leaves. The larger ones 
may be cut into quarters and the smaller ones into 
halves. Have boiling enough of water to cover them ; 
throw into it a little salt and a very small quantity of 



FOR BOILING. 53 

carbonate of soda. When these are dissolved, put in 
the greens and boil them till tender. When done, 
place them between two plates and squeeze the water 
out of them. Dish them compactly in a vegetable dish, 
cut the whole mass as it lies in the dish, through and 
through, into dice of a convenient size for helping at 
table, and serve hot. When greens are boiled along with 
a round of beef, they are better not drained, but served 
saturated with the beef liquor. 

Caulifiower and Brocoli require very careful cleaning. 
After removing the outside leaves, and trimming the 
tops of the others to a level with the heart, lay the ve- 
getables for an hour in salt and water, and then rinse 
them in a stream of water allowed to run from the stop- 
cock, to clean out the interior thoroughly. Boil as di- 
rected for cabbages, and when tender, drain them. Dish 
them neatly without breaking, and serve either plain 
or with melted butter or brown sauce poured over them. 

Green Peas should not be shelled till immediately 
before being boiled. Use no more water than will just 
cover them. When it is boiling, throw into it some 
salt, and, if the peas are not very young, a little sugar; 
then put in the peas and boil till quite tender, but not 
too long, or they will burst and dissolve. Drain them 
in a colander, and when dished stir gently among them 
a small piece of butter and a little pepper. Serve them 
quite hot. Sometimes a few sprigs of mint are boiled 
^vith the peas, for those who like the flavour of it. 

French Beans, Scarlet Runners, and Yoimg Kidney 
Beans. Cut off the tops and tails, drawing off the tough 
back-string, and cut the pods in pieces slantingly, or 
if large split them lengthwise and then divide them 
across. Lay them for half an hour in salt and water. 
Put them into boiling water with a little salt and car- 
bonate of soda to preserve their colour, and boil till 
tender. Then drain, and dish them; sprinkle them 
with salt and pepper, and lightly stir in a little butter. 

Brussels Sprouts are boiled and served in the same 
way. About forty small ones make a good-sized dish. 



54 DIRECTIONS 

Spinach. This requires careful picking and washing 
in several waters. It should be boiled briskly in salt 
and water. Ten minutes' boiling will make it tender. 
It is then drained on a sieve, pressing it lightly to re- 
move the water. It is next beat up in a stew-pan 
placed over the fire, with butter, pepper, and salt, to 
which a little broth may be added. It should be dish- 
ed quite hot, the top being smoothed and neatly scored 
in diamonds. A more tasteful method is to press it 
nto a leaf-shaped mould, and turn it out into the dish. 
Very young spinage should be boiled with no more 
water than what adheres to it after washing. 

Winchor or Broad Beans. Shell and wash them, and 
if old, skin them. Put them on in boiling water, with 
a little salt, and boil till tender. When not used as 
an accompaniment to pickled pork or bacon, they are 
served with parsley-sauce poured over them. 

White Harricot Beans, Egyptian or Gabanza Beans, 
and Lentils. These being hard and dry, must be al- 
lowed time in cooking to absorb moisture and become 
softened. The larger kind of harricots even requir 
some hours soaking in cold water. Put them on a slow 
fire in plenty of cold water with a little salt, a very 
little carbonate of soda if the water is hard, and a bit 
of butter. They should be heated gradually, and sim- 
mered till tender, which may take about three hours 
in the case of the beans, and rather less for the lentils. 
Then drain them, and serve with a little butter, pepper 
and salt, and sugar, stirred among them. Or they 
may be treated as follows : — Fry a sliced onion till/ 
brown, in a stew-pan with a little butter, to which add 
the boiled seeds, a little more butter, some flour, and 
gravy or strong soup ; season with pepper and salt, stir 
them up, boil for ten minutes, and serve hot. 

Rice, after being Avell washed in two waters, must 
be thrown into salted water boiling quickly. When 
considercibly softened but not quite tender, drain it, 
and put it into a stew-pan which has been heated, and 
buttered on the inside. Close the lid tightly, and 



FOR BOILING. 55 

place the stew-pan by the fire or in the oven till the 
cooking' is finished, — taking care not to let the rice 
burn. Rice cooked in this way will be perfectly white, 
the grains being swelled to their full size, tolerably dry, 
not sticking together, and perfectly tender. Prepared 
thus to be eaten along with hash or curry, it may either 
be served separately in a covered dish, or surrounding 
the curry in the same dish. A very nice mode of pre- 
paring it as an accompaniment to roast or stewed meat 
is, — to press it compactly into a buttered mould after 
draining it, and then to finish the cooking in the oven, 
or in a pot of boiling water, taking care that no water 
enters the mould. When turned out, this pudding will 
cut in firm solid slices. 

A^. B. — The liquor in which any vegetables, except 
potatoes, have been boiled, may be used in making 
soup. Indeed the water of beans and lentils makes a 
very good soup male/ re, with the addition of some onion 
fried in butter thickened with flour and parsley, or any 
other flavouring herbs, vegetables, or seasonings that 
may be desired. 

£Jc/gs are placed gently in a pan of boiling water 
with a spoon, taking care not to let them knock against 
the bottom, which would crack them. A net or wire 
basket is preferable to a spoon, especially if a number 
are boiled at once. From three to four minutes boil- 
ing, counting from the time they are put in, will be 
sufl[iciejit for full-sized eggs, and a little less for small 
ones, — always remembering that perfectly/ fresh eggs 
take a little longer than others. They should always 
be covered with water. 

An improved method is to remove the pan from the 
fire immediately after the eggs are put in, and let them 
remain in the water about teji minutes. Or the boiling 
water may be poured gently over the eggs in a basin. 
Either way, if the quantity of boiling Avater is properly 
proportioned to the number of eggs, ten minutes im- 
mersion will cook them. Done in this manner, the 
yolk will always be thickened, while the white is just 



56 DIRECTIONS FOR BOILING. 

set and no more, being converted into a delicate white 
curd much more digestible than the firm solid substance 
produced by the usual method. If too much water 
has been used, or the eggs are allowed to remain too 
long in it, the yolk will be found set firm, although 
the white will never be hardened ; and if the quantity 
of water has been too small, the yolk will sometimes be 
set, while the white remains half raw. This shows that 
the yolk is set at a lower temperature than the white, 
the heat required for either being considerably lower 
than boiling. The quantity of water should be about 
half-a-pint to each egg, the pan being of such a size 
as to allow the water to cover the eggs. When done 
in a basin, a little more water will be required. This 
proportion of water must of course be considerably 
reduced where a large number of eggs are done at once, 
because the cooling of a large quantity of water is pro- 
portionally slower than that of a smaller quantity. 

Poached Eggs are prepared by breaking the shell and 
dropping the contents into boiling water with a little 
vinegar and salt in it. This should be done as close 
as possible to the surface of the water for fear of break- 
ing the yolk and giving the white a ragged appear- 
ance Avhen set, from its mixing too much with the 
water. For the same reason, the ebullition should not 
be too brisk. Perhaps a safer plan is to break each 
egg into a separate tea-cup, and immersing the cup in 
the boiling water, lower its lip so as to allow the water 
to enter and the egg to float out. By this plan also it 
is possible to examine whether the eggs are fresh or 
not, before they are put into the water. Care must be 
taken to allow one to set before another is put in, that 
they may not stick together, and to take them out in 
the order of their immersion. When the white is com- 
pletely set, the egg is lifted out with a small drainer, 
and the water allowed to drain from it for a minute. 
It is then ready for serving on hot buttered toast, or 
broiled or fried bacon or ham. There is an excellent 
apparatus sold by tinsmiths for poaching eggs. It con-

sists of a frame holding several perforated shallow cups, 
each large enough to contain an egg. This is immersed 
in the boiling water to the depth of the cups, into which 
the eggs are then dropped in the usual way. Thus the 
eggs are preserved from spreading through the water, 
and cooked in a more compact shape. 



CHAPTEK VII. 

BROILING. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Broiling is the most expeditious mode of cooking. It 
is also one of the best for meat that is in proper cook- 
ing condition ; but for meat that is not, it is of all pro- 
cesses the worst. The reason is, that being performed 
upon slices and not masses of meat, a hic/h temperature 
is required to cook the meat before it becomes too much 
dried ; and this is of itself sufficiently apt to toughen 
the meat without the assistance of other unfavourable 
conditions. Broiling requires a strong glowing fire 
without flame or smoke. If the fire is not quite in this 
state, and there is no time to wait till it " burn through," 
the flame may be reduced and kept under by sprinkling 
salt upon the coals. The gridiron, which must always 
be kept clean and bright, should be first heated and 
then rubbed Avith a piece of suet before placing the 
meat on it ; — this prevents the meat sticking to it. The 
slices to be broiled should be cut of an even thickness, of 
not much less than three quarters of an inch, lest they 
be dried and hardened, — nor more than an inch, else 
they will be still raw in the interior, Avhile the outside 
is half burnt. The practice (recommended by some 
cooks) of beating them with the rolling pin, is decidedly 
a bad one ; it ruptures the juice vessels, and so occasions 
a loss of gravy. The article broiled, especially if it be 



58 DIRECTIONS 

juicj, such as a beef-steak, should be turned very fre- 
quently ; this process not only ensures its being cooked 
equally through on both sides, but prevents the expul- 
sion of the juice on the upper side. For turning the 
meat, a small pair of tongs made for that purpose is the 
best, a fork being sure to make holes by which the 
gravy is lost. Sometimes the gridiron is made double, 
so that the meat being held between its two flaps, which 
are fastened together by a hinge, the whole is turned 
together without removing the meat. This form of 
gridiron, however, although it certainly saves the labour 
of the cook, has the disadvantage of frequently making 
unseemly marks on the meat by the pressure of the 
bars, which also tends to squeeze out the gravy, and to 
render the meat hard. Another modification of the 
gridiron is one in which every bar is hollowed into a 
gutter to catch the gravy and fat, and prevent them 
dropping into the fire and there making a smoky blaze. 
This, however, necessitates the bars' being so broad as 
in a great measure to shelter the meat from that direct 
action of the fire Avhich is essential to broiling. The 
best gridiron has small round bars, and is provided with 
a tin gutter along the front to catch the gravy ; and if 
the cook pays proper attention to the turning, and 
places her gridiron aslant so that the fat runs down the 
bars into the gutter, or to the back of the grate if the 
gridiron has no gutter, very little gravy will be lost, and 
she will not be much annoyed by a blazing fire. 

An excellent method of broiling, well adapted for 
steaks, chops, fish, — in fact, for anything that requires 
to be quickly cooked, is performed with a flat tin dish 
upon which the article to be broiled is placed perpen- 
dicularly in front of the fire. This dish should have a 
couple of moveable hold- fasts, or a spring clip, like a 
letter-clip, to secure the meat or fish from dropping ofi", 
and its lower edge should be provided with a gutter to 
catch the dripping and gravy. It may also be made to 
slide towards and from the fire, upon a stout wire frame 
constructed to hook on to the front of the grate. The 



FOR BROILING. 59 

advantages of this method are : — 1st, That it can be 
employed when the fire may not be clear enough on 
the top, or sufficiently free from smoke and flame, to 
permit the use of the gridiron; 2d, That the annoy- 
ance of the fat dropping into the fire and making a 
blaze is avoided ; 3d, Any gravy that may exude from 
the meat while broiling is saved ; and 4th, That less 
heat as well as moisture is lost from the side of the 
meat not exposed to the fire, this being covered by the 
back or bottom of the broiling dish. 

Broiled meat should be served and eaten the instant 
it is cooked, for every minute it stands deteriorates its 
quality; so that those who wish to dine upon meat 
broiled in perfection, must be content to wait a few 
minutes for their dinner rather than allow their dinner 
to wait for them. 

Beef Steaks. — Although those cut from the rump are 
considered the best, yet the sir-loin or the spare-rib 
supply very palatable steaks if the meat is good and 
has been kept long enough. Having cut the steaks as 
above directed, trim off any superfluous suet, and di- 
vide them into pieces of a convenient size for serving 
at table. Sprinkle both sides with a mixture of pepper 
and salt, and broil according to the preceding general 
directions. The time required must vary according to 
the strength of the fire, the thickness of the steaks, 
and the taste of those who are to eat them, many per- 
sons preferring them rather underdone, while others 
like them to be thoroughly cooked. When finished, 
place them in a very hot dish, rub them with a little 
fresh butter, add a table-spoonful of mushroom ket- 
chup, and send them to table under a hot cover imme- 
diately. When steaks are broiled for a party of more 
than two persons, they should be sent to table in two 
or three separate supplies, so that they may be eaten as 
soon as done, because if they are all served at once, those 
that are first cooked will have lost much of their good- 
ness while waiting till the last is finished. They may 
be garnished with a little scraped horse-radish. Mus-

tard is the condiment almost universally taken with 
beef steaks. Pickles are sometimes used, but many 
prefer oyster or mushroom sauce. Plain boiled pota- 
toes and bread should not be omitted. 

Mutton and Lamb Chops are best cut from the middle 
of the loin. They are also sometimes taken from the 
neck. They are cooked and served in the same way 
as beef steaks. The buttering may be omitted in dish- 
ing, as the mutton is generally fat enough of itself. 
Mutton steaks from the back vibs, and cutlets from the 
gigot, may also be broiled as above. Before broiling 
these chops, it is a good plan, not always practised, to 
trim away unnecessary fat, and as much of the bone, 
especially the thick end of it, as can be neatly taken 
away ; — there will thus be less troublesome dropping 
of grease into the fire, and the raw bone, as before ob- 
served, yields more juice for soup or gravy than a cooked 
one. Soyers Mutton or Lamb chop is sawn from the 
saddle; — the "jagging" of the meat by the saw, "caus- 
ing the chops to eat more tender," says its inventor. 
Be this as it may, however, the idea is certainly good, 
as the chop exhibits a more equal distribution of fat 
and lean than the ordinary one, and the undivided 
bone in the centre, assists in retaining the gravy. 

Veal Cutlets should be very well seasoned, and Avhile 
broiling basted occasionally by dipping them in fresh 
butter melted in a plate. A more savoury method is : 
— having fried till brown some very finely chopped 
6nion and parsley in a little butter, dip the cutlets 
first into this, then into bread crumbs seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and then broil them. Immediately 
before serving, pour over them a rich Brown Gravy 
thickened with butter and flour, flavoured with finely- 
minced orange-peel and some grated ginger, and made 
quite hot. 

Kidneys and Sweetbreads are sometimes broiled. The 
kidneys must first be split through the middle and laid 
open but not separated, and then strung upon skewers 
60 as to keep them open and flat. Sweetbreads must 



FOR BROILING. 61 

be previously parboiled. Both should be highly sea- 
soned with pepper and salt before placing them on the 
gridiron, and the sweetbreads are the better of being 
basted as above described for veal cutlets. Both may 
be rendered more savoury by first " egging" them, and 
then dipping them in a highly-seasoned mixture of 
bread-crumbs and finely-minced herbs, — sprinkling 
them also with the mixture while they are broiling, 

Pork Chops are perhaps the most indigestible of all 
forms of animal food. Those who have sufficient con- 
fidence in their gastric powers may try them. They 
are cut from the neck or loin, peppered, and must be 
thoroughly cooked. When done, serve them very hot, 
sprinkled with salt, or, if liked, a gravy flavoured with 
mustard and dry pulverized sage-leaves may be poured 
over them. Their appropriate condiment is mustard. 

Ham and Bacon. These, for broiling, ought not to 
be too old or dry. Though every part of bacon is very 
good, the streaky part of the thick flank is the best. 
The slices need not be above a quarter of an inch thick. 
If rather dry, dip them for a minute or so in vinegar 
and water. The rind should be taken off, and each 
slice broiled for about five minutes, more or less ac- 
cording to the strength of the fire; during which time 
it should be turned three or four times. Serve them 
very hot. When poached eggs are served upon them, 
care should be taken to have both ready at the same 
time, as neither is improved by waiting for the other. 

Sausages, before broiling, should be pricked all over 
with a pin, to allow the steam to escape without burst- 
ing them. They should be done over a slow fire, turn- 
ing them three or four times till of a nice yellow colour. 
Serve them very hot. 

Fowls and Pigeons. Being drav/n, plucked, cleaned 
and trussed as for boiling, they are split down the back 
with a sharp knife, laid open, and pressed or beaten as 
flat as possible. If the fowl be large or old, the breast 
bone may be taken out, and also that of the rough part 



62 DIRECTIONS 

of the back. Season them plentifully all over with a 
mixture of pepper and salt, and broil them gently over 
a slow fire, giving the inside surface the first of the fire, 
turning them every five minutes till thoroughly cooked, ^ 
and basting them occasionally with butter melted, ap- 
plied with a feather. When the flesh feels firm at the 
thickest part they are broiled enough. They then should 
have a fine golden yellow colour. Being thicker than 
chops or steaks, and requiring to be more thoroughly 
cooked, they require a longer time to broil, and must 
be done over a slower fire, or at a greater distance from 
it. Serve very hot, with parsley sauce, melted butter, 
beef gravy thickened, or mushroom sauce. Pigeons are 
sometimes broiled whole, in which case they are stuffed 
as for roasting, the stuffing however being rather more 
highly seasoned. 

Rabbits, cut in quarters, may be broiled exactly as 
the preceding. 

Salmon. Slices cut fi-om the thick part of the fish, 
previously cleaned and scaled, are dipped in flour, and 
broiled over a clear fire. When done, rub them with a 
little fresh butter, and serve very hot, with caper sauce 
or any fish sauce that may be preferred. Kippered 
Salmon is broiled in slices the same way. 

Rizzared Haddocks and Whitings are general favou- 
rites for breakfast or supper. They are prepared by 
laying them in salt for twelve hours, more or less ac- 
cording to their size, after being well cleaned as for 
boiling, and then hanging them to dry in a cool airy 
situation, upon a rod run through the eye-sockets. 
They are broiled without seasoning, merely taking the 
heads off, but not skinning them as is sometimes recom- 
mended, for the skin, though uneatable, keeps in the 
juice. If the fish are large, it is as well to split and lay 
them open before broiling. These fish may also be 
broiled while fresh, but they are better cured as above. 
Serve hot, with some slices of fresh butter separate, to 
be used with them by those who like it. 



FOR BROILING. 63 

Firman Haddocks. These should be chosen of a mid- 
dling size, and not too stale. Before broiling, they 
must be skinned ; and it is as well, since they do not 
require very much cooking, to cut them in halves 
lengthwise, and to broil the thick and thin halves sepa- 
rately, otherwise the latter will be overdone before the 
former are cooked. Serve with fresh butter, as in the 
preceding receipt. (Finnan haddocks, if small, may 
also be cooked by pouring boiling water upon them in 
a dish and letting them lie in it for a minute or two. 
This last plan is a very good one for small dried fish 
which would be too much hardened by broiling.) 

Fresh Herrings and Sprats, after being well cleaned, 
are wiped dry with a cloth, then dipped in flour, and 
broiled over a moderate fire. For convenience, the sprats, 
being small, are strung in rows upon thin skewers run 
through their heads, and thus laid upon the gridiron. 
For sauce, m^elted butter with a little mushroom ketchiip 
and vinegar or lemon juice in it, may be used. 

Red Herrings are broiled plain, rubbed with butter, 
sprinkled v/ith pepper, and served hot. If rather dry 
and salt, steep them for a short time before broiling. 

Kippered Herrings are broiled and served hot, with- 
out sauce or any other seasoning than a little salt if 
they require it. 

Salt Herrings require soaking and cleansing. Wipe 
them dry, broil, and serve them like red herrings. 

Macharel, after being cleaned, should be split open 
and laid flat, rubbed with butter, sprinkled with pepper 
and salt, and then broiled. 

Trout are prepared in the same manner. Both trout 
and fresh herrings may be rizzared like haddocks, but 
should not lie in salt nor hang so long afterwards. 

Skate, if small, is very good broiled. It should be 
prepared as for boiling, wiped dry, sprinkled with flour 
and pepper and salt, and served Avith melted butter if 
a sauce is required. 



64 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

CHAPTER VIII 

FHYIWG. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

This is as expeditious a process as broilinof, and is ap- 
plicable not only to the same class of articles, but like- 
wise to many odd pieces of cooked and uncooked meat, 
as well as vegetables, which could hardly be prepared 
in any other way. Hence it is considered, upon the 
whole, the more economical of the two. It is also, at 
least that mode of it distinguished by the French term 
Sauter, the way in which a hirge class of preparations^ 
of which the common pancake may be called the type, 
are cooked. 

In one respect frying is similar to broiling : it is appli- 
cable only to small articles. And the reason of this is 
the same in both cases, — viz. that the heat employed 
is so great that it would infallibly char the greater part 
of a large article before the centre of it was half cooked. 
But in the case of frying there is a peculiar necessity 
for this high temperature ; for the medium by which 
it is applied (melted fat or oil), which is not by any 
means either palatable or digestible, would otherwise 
penetrate the article fried, and destroy its good quali- 
ties. But this is prevented both by the crust or skin 
into which the heat hardens the surface of the article, 
and also by the repulsive force of the steam into which 
the moisture of the meat is converted the instant it 
comes in contact with the hot fat. 

The fat used in frying must be perfectly fresh, as 
the slightest rancidity will communicate its flavour to 
whatever is placed in it. Although butter or dripping 
are the best for butcher meat, and lard or oil for fish, 
yet good dripping will be found to answer very well 
for all sorts of animal food, and is generally the most 



FOR FRYING. 65 

economical ; — for pancakes &c., butter only should be 
used. The butter will be found much less apt. to burn 
if previously clarified from the traces of milk it con- 
tains by melting it in a jar placed in hot water, and 
pouring off the clear oil from the sediment which falls 
to the bottom. In frying by either mode, the fat used 
should not be stinted, and care should be taken to have 
it of a proper heat before putting the meat &c. into it. 
This heat may be ascertained by dipping into the fat 
the end of a small piece of bread : if the bread becomes 
slightly coloured and crisp immediately, the fat is hot 
enough ; if it is dark-coloured and looks charred, the 
fat has been made too hot. The evil arising from the 
fat not being hot enough is, that the meat will absorb 
some of it ; if it is too hot, the outside will be burnt 
before the interior is cooked. The same fat will serve 
many times if it be carefully prevented from burning, 
and separated from all traces of gravy or other impuri- 
ties every time it is set aside for future use. Fat whicli 
has been once used for fish should not be employed for 
anything else, as it retains the smell and flavour of the 
fish. 

The use of eggs and bread-crumbs for all kinds of 
steaks and chops, though generally considered unne- 
cessary and expensive, will be found to be a decided 
improvement, for two reasons : first, because the gravy 
is better preserved in the meat by the artificial skin or 
crust of coagulated egg; and secondly, because this 
egg crust being formed at a much lower temperature 
than is required to produce an equally efiicient skin by 
hardening the surface of the meat itself, there is a 
smaller chance of the meat being hardened, and also of 
the dripping or butter being burnt. For fish, more 
especially where it has a large cut surface, eggs and 
bread crumbs are absolutely necessary to prevent that 
unpleasant absorption of the oil which the naturally 
loose texture of all fish might otherwise occasion. To 
apply this covering, the article is first dipped into or 
smeared with well-beaten egg, and then rolled among 

F 



66 DIRECTIONS 

the crumbs of stale bread rubbed very small. The 
coating should be thick and complete. Oatmeal is by 
some people thought a very good substitute for bread- 
crumbs, especially for fish. All solid articles may 
either be fried by complete immersion in the hot drip- 
ping, or sauteed (see page 17.) Pancakes, Omelettes, 
&c., of which eggs are the basis, are always sauteed. 
Fish are best fried in the former method, being so apt 
to break when being turned while sauteing. 



Beef-Steaks, Mutton and Lamh Chops, Veal Cutlets, 
and Pork Chops, are all fried till of a fine light brown 
colour, following the above General Directions. When 
sauteed, the best gravy for them is made by pouring a 
little hot water into the frying-pan after they are re- 
moved, and, after pouring off the superfluous fat, adding 
a little pepper, salt, ketchup, and flour. A few sliced 
onions may be added to this sauce if liked ; they are 
put in and fried for a few minutes before pouring off 
the fat. When fried by complete immersion, which 
however is not the usual mode, a brown gravy thickened 
with flour may be required. In this case, however, a 
coating of egg and bread-crumbs is advisable. Such 
a covering may also be used in sauteing, and it may 
be flavoured by the addition to the bread-crumbs of 
appropriate seasonings and herbs finely minced. Thus 
chopped parsley and lemon-peel, with pepper and salt, 
may be used for veal cutlets ; and sage and onion for 
pork chops. The gravy for veal cutlets may be slightly 
acidulated with lemon-juice. Apple sauce is sometimes 
taken with pork chops. 

Minced Collops, seasoned with chopped onion, pepper, 
and salt, made into flattened balls or thick cakes, and 
then well dusted with flour, may be sauteed in butter 
or dripping. A sauce made by dredging a little flour 
into the pan after they are cooked, adding a little hot 
water or broth, and some mushroom ketchup, and 
simmering for a minute, may be poured over them. 

Kidneys, split open and laid flat, and highly sea- 



FOR FRYING. 67 

soned with pepper and salt, are saiiteed in butter over 
a brisk fire. They should be thoroughly cooked, but 
not overdone. While sauteing, chopped onion may be 
sprinkled over them. Serve them upon dry toast, in a 
flat dish, with the contents of the pan poured over them. 

Sweetbreads, previously parboiled, and cut into slices, 
should be egged and rolled in bread-crumbs, which may 
be seasoned with lemon-peel, pepper, salt, and parsley. 
They are sauteed in butter, and served with a sauce 
of melted butter seasoned with mushroom ketchup. 
They may be garnished with thin slices of fried bacon. 

Lamb's and Galfs Liver should be sliced, soaked in 
water, wiped dry, and fried as above. 

Tripe, previously boiled till tender, is wiped dry with 
a cloth, — dipped in a thickish batter made of eggs, 
flour, and milk, seasoned with milk, and, if liked, minced 
onion, — and fried in plenty of lard or dripping. When 
coloured light brown it is served hot, garnished with 
fried parsley. (Before frying this garnishing, the pars- 
ley being washed clean, should be thoroughly dried; and 
when cooked, the fat should be well drained from it be- 
fore placing it in the dish). This is a very good method 
of cooking the remains of a dish of boiled tripe. 

Bacon, or Ham, and Eggs. This dish is a general 
favourite. It is prepared thus : — The ham or bacon 
should be evenly cut, not above a quarter of an inch 
thick, and the eggs carefully broken, so as not to rup- 
ture the yolks, each into a separate tea-cup. The ham 
is then sauteed in a very little butter or dripping, care 
being taken not to harden it by over-cooking. When 
done, place it in a hot dish before the fire, and then 
cook the eggs in the fat that remains, slipping them 
gently out of the cups without breaking or spreading 
them too much in the pan. When the whites are just 
set, lift the eggs gently with a perforated slice and place 
them upon the ham in the dish, each upon a separate 
slice, and serve hot immediately. When bacon is 
sauteed, its own fat will be sufficient to cook it in if it 
is good. The condiments to be placed on the table 



68 DIRECTIONS 

with this dish are mustard, pepper, and vinegar. If 
preferred, the eggs may be poached instead of sauteed, 
(see page 5Q) 

Sausages, before being fried, should be pricked in se- 
veral places to permit the escape of the steam, which 
would otherwise burst them. It is an improvement to 
throw them into boiling water for a minute or two be- 
fore frying them. They may be served upon mashed 
potatoes, or upon toasted bread, with a garnishing of 
poached eggs, (see page 56.) Fried sausages are some- 
times employed to garnish roast turkey. 

A young Foivl or Chicken, prepared as for boiling 
(see page 46), may be sauteed in butter, either with or 
without egg and bread-crumbs. When perfectly tender 
and of a rich golden tint, a sauce is prepared by pour- 
ing off the superfluous butter, dredging a little flour 
into the pan, adding a little boiling water, and a season- 
ing of ketchup, pepper, salt, and a bouquet of parsley. 
Let the fowl simmer for a few minutes in this, then dish 
it, and keep it hot while the sauce is being reduced to 
a proper consistence ; then the parsley should be re- 
moved, a little lemon-juice added if liked, and the 
sauce poured over the fowl. In this sauce various kinds 
of vegetables, such as green peas, carrot and turnip, or 
cucumbers cut small, or a few mushrooms or sliced 
onions, may be stewed till tender, and the whole poured 
over the fowl when served. 

iV. B. — If the fowl is large, it will be the better of 
being previously stewed or boiled, and cut up into 
smaller pieces. The bread-crumbs used in covering it 
may be seasoned to taste with nutmeg, pepper, salt, 
and minced parsley. 

Potatoes, cut in thin slices, are fried in plenty of 
dripping made rather hot. When dished, sprinkle 
them with salt. 

FISH. For all kinds of fish, more particularly flat 
fish and the smaller sorts, frying is perhaps the most 
fiavoury mode of cooking. In every case, whether 
gauteing or frying by complete immersion be the mode 



FOR FRYING. 69 

employed (the latter, if properly done, will be found 
the best), a good thick coating of egg and bread- 
crumbs should be used. Haddocks, whitings, skate, 
and soles may be skinned before applying this covering 
to them, and eels must be so. In all other respects, 
and for every kind of fish, the modus operandi is that 
described in the following general directions : — 

\st, If the fish, or piece of fish, is large, such as a 
sole, the fat ought to be slightly cooled as soon as the 
outside coating has become sufficiently firm to exclude 
it, in order that the interior of the fish may be cooked 
without burning the surface. This may be done either 
by adding a little cold dripping to the hot fat, or by 
raising the pan farther from the fire. However, it will 
be found a better plan to cut the larger fish into fillets 
or slices, which is the form best suited to this mode of 
cooking. 

2d, If, in consequence of the fish being too wet, the 
egg and bread-crumbs will not adhere properly, the 
fish may first be rolled in flour. 

3t7, The fish should be placed in a stout iron-wire 
basket having a handle, so that it can be immersed in 
the hot fat, held there till cooked, and then lifted out 
without the slightest risk of its breaking, Avhich is the 
chief objection against sauteing fish. 

Uh, When fish are sauteed., they must be turned 
very carefully by means of a flat tin slice, and oc- 
casionally raised from the bottom of the pan with the 
same instrument, to prevent their sticking to it and 
being burnt. Unless the greatest care is taken in the 
use of the slice, fish sauteed will infallibly be broken, 
in which case they lose juice and absorb grease, and are 
greatly deteriorated. The same sauces are used with 
fried fish as with boiled. 

Thin slices of Bread, cut into any fanciful form, and 
fried till crisp and brown in the fat which remains 
after frying any of the above, form a very useful gar- 
nishing for them.

CHAPTEPv IX. 

STEWinSTG. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

There are few branches of cookery, the thorough 
knowledge of which is so important to the housewife as 
that of stewing, both because of the large variety of 
dishes which may be produced by it, and also on 
account of its great economy. To the poorer classes 
this latter is of course its chief recommendation. Not 
only does this process play the chief part in the pre- 
paration of all those expensive ragouts and fricassees in 
which the rich luxuriate, but, from its save-all and 
use-all capabilities, it is eminently suited to the less 
pretending meal of the artizan. Like roasting, it has 
the advantage of not abstracting any of the nutriment 
from the food prepared by it, besides which it possesses 
others peculiar to itself By its means many of those 
inferior pieces of meat whose irregular shape and coarse 
texture make it impossible either to roast or boil them 
satisfactorily, may be rendered not only tender and 
digestible, but, with the addition of a few inexpensive 
vegetables and seasonings, highly palatable. It also 
affords those whose means enable them to indulge in 
a small roast or boiled joint, an economical way of 
procuring a hot dinner out of the cold remains. 

Although the method of stewing of course varies 
with the kind of food to which it is applied, yet these 
variations are perfectly consistent with and indeed 
rendered necessary by those General Principles detailed 
iu Chapter IV. For example, in stewing raw meat it 



FOR STEWING. 71 

is first saut€ed in the bottom of the stewpan (some cooks 
recommend half-roasting, but this must be attended 
with a greater loss of moisture), in order to seal up 
the surface so as to prevent the escape of juice, and 
then a small quantity of hot water, broth, or gravy, as 
the case may be, is added, in which the cooking is com- 
pleted by very slow simmering — not boiling — the lid of 
the stewpan being kept close shut down. The pre- 
liminary sauteing being intended merely to harden the 
surface of the meat, and by no means to cook it, must 
of course be carried no farther than is necessary to ac- 
complish that purpose ; it should therefore be rapidly 
done over a strong fire. Meat, on the other hand, 
which has been already cooked, ought not to be 
sauteed, because this would be useless, since all its 
albumen has been already coagulated. It should be 
placed at once in a warm gravy previously prepared, 
and merely heated in this without even simmering ; 
because, having been already acted upon by heat, there 
is some risk of its becoming hardened by too high a 
temperature. The length of time required to cook 
meat by stewing, varies, of course, with the size of the 
pieces, and also with their texture, a coarse gristly 
piece requiring a longer time than a good fleshy piece, 
in order that its tendinous parts may become softened 
and partially dissolved. As regards time, however, 
this process has a peculiar advantage in the fact that, 
provided the heat be not made too great, there is little 
danger of the meat being spoiled by keeping it hot in 
the stewpan for some time after the cooking is com- 
pleted. The reason of this is, that the meat being con- 
tained with water in a close vessel, cannot be dried up 
as a roast would be ; neither can its juice be so thinned 
and rendered insipid as that of boiled meat would be, 
because the quantity of water employed is very consi- 
derably less. Hence stewing is the best mode of cook- 
ing for those whose hour of dining is uncertain. 

Ragouts and Fricassees differ from plain stews in this, 
that the gravy is enriched by the addition of various 



72 DIRECTIONS 

flavouring substances and seasonings. The meat in 
these cases is generally cut into pieces, so that it may 
more thoroughly imbibe these additional flavours. The 
ragout is the more highly seasoned preparation of the 
two, and is best adapted for the high-flavoured and 
dark-coloured meats. The fricassee, on the contrary, 
is more mild and bland in its favour, and being gene- 
rally composed of the white and delicate meats, its 
colour ought to correspond, — to ensure which the pre- 
liminary sauteing of the meat must be very carefully 
and delicately done, and the yolk of eggs and cream 
are added to the gravy. 



Rump, Brisket, and Shin of Beef. Each of these may 
be stewed in a single piece if not too large, simply as 
above described. Being sprinkled with pepper and 
salt, it is in the first place sauteed with butter or drip- 
ping in the stewpan and frequently shifted so as to 
brown it on all sides, and prevent it from sticking to 
the bottom. A little water, slightly salted, is then 
added, in which it must stew slowly under a close 
cover ; the stewpan being occasionally shaken to per- 
vent its burning on the bottom, which may be farther 
guarded against by a few skewers laid under the meat. 
(N.B. The bone of the shin of beef should be sawn in 
three or four pieces.) Thus prepared, especially if the 
quantity of water used be very small, the stew will be 
not very unlike a roast, both in appearance and flavour, 
the latter being however decidedly stronger than that 
of roast meat. The water will be found converted into 
a rich gravy, which is of course served along with the 
stew. A Ragout is prepared by substituting broth, or 
a gravy made from the bones cut out of the meat for 
that purpose, instead of water, and using rather more 
of it ; and after the meat has stewed till nearly ready, 
adding sliced carrot and turnip cut in small slices, and 
shortly thereafter some onion and a seasoning of spices 
and sweet herbs according to taste. When the vege- 
^bles are tender, a little mushroom ketchup may be 



FOR STEWING. 73 

added to the gravy, -whicli is likewise thickened by the 
addition of a piece of butter rolled in flour. A rump 
of beef, dressed as above, may be stuffed with a force- 
meat placed in the cavity formed by cutting out the bone. 
The ragout is served with the gravy poured over it. — - 
Another mode is to cut the meat in neat slices before 
cooking it ; in this case the preliminary sauteing is of 
great importance. Sometimes balls of forcemeat (see 
p. 26) are added to the ragout in about ten minutes 
after the meat is ready, and celery is also used to 
flavour it, though this may as effectually be done by a 
little celery seed. Curry powder may also be intro- 
duced with advantage. This mode of stewing meat in 
slices will be found available for many of the coarser 
pieces, all that is necessary to render them tender 
being careful and long-continued simmering. To such 
ragouts (sometimes called Haricots), many persons add 
maccaroni or vermicelli, which require from ten to 
twenty minutes cooking along with the stew. 

Minced Collops, Any piece of tender lean beef, freed 
from skin and gristle, is finely minced along with two 
or three onions, and seasoned with pepper and salt. 
This is sauteed in a little butter in the stew-pan till 
slightly browned, being continually beaten and stirred 
about with a spoon during the process, to keep it from 
sticking to the bottom or forming lumps. A slight 
dredging of flour is then added, and immediately after- 
wards a little hot water, broth, or gravy extracted from 
the skin and gristle which have been cut away from 
the meat. A few minutes gentle stewing will now finish 
the process, wdien the mince may be dished with strips 
of toasted bread round it. 

N. B. Anj odd scraps of already cooked meat, minced 
finely, and even the exhausted meat which has been 
used to make gravy or beef tea, may be mixed with this 
dish. These however must not be added until very 
shortly before serving, as they do not require cooking, 
but merely re-warming. 

Beef Olives consist of thin steaks spread over with a 



74 DIRECTIONS 

highly seasoned forcemeat, rolled up tightly and tied 
with pack-thread. These are stewed and served in the 
usual way. 

Beef Kidneys. These are cut open, soaked in water, 
wiped dry and floured, and then stewed, after being 
slightly sauteed in butter. The seasoning is generally 
minced onion and parsley, with pepper and salt, to 
which a little vinegar or onion-pickle liquor may be 
added if liked. The dish may be garnished with fried 
parsley. 

A Shoulder of Mutton may be stewed or ragoued pre- 
cisely as directed above for Rump of Beef The blade- 
bone may be cut out, and the cavity thus formed stuffed 
with forcemeat. 

A Haricot of Mutton or Lamb may be made of chops 
cut from the loin or back ribs, or in fact of any part 
which can be more conveniently cooked in slices than 
whole. Irish Stew is simply a haricot of mutton in 
which sliced potatoes and onions are the vegetable in- 
gredients. 

Veal. The best parts for stewing are the Fillet, the 
Breast and the Shoulder. These, especially the last, are 
the better of being stuffed as for roasting. For the 
preliminary sauteing, butter should be used. The thick- 
ened sauce is improved by a slight seasoning of cayenne, 
salt, and lemon juice. 

Venison. On account of its dryness, this is better 
stewed than roasted. The Shoulder is stewed precisely 
as directed for the same part of mutton ; only it should 
be rather more highly seasoned, and a rich gravy made 
from mutton or beef may be used instead of water. 

Hare or Babbit must be washed and cut in pieces. 
After sauteing in fresh butter, it should be gently stewed 
in a little water, or, what is better, some gravy prepared 
from the neck, head, liver, &c. The sauce should be 
thickened with flour, and the stew seasoned to taste 
with sliced onion, pepper and salt, and ketchup. Jugged 
hare is cooked as above, omitting the sauteing, and in- 
stead of the stew-pan, using a closely covered earthen

jar, placed in a kettle of boiling water. Rabbits may 
be fricasseed as directed below for chickens. 

Fowls and Pigeons may be stewed whole, trussed as 
if for boiling, and with either a stuffing, or simply some 
butter and pepper inside. After being sauteed, dust a 
little flour over them, then add some hot water or 
gravy, season them highly, and stew till tender. A 
very good dish may be made by using clear mutton 
or veal broth, seasoned with sliced onion, white pepper, 
and salt, and when the fowl has stewed in this for about 
half an hour, adding a tea-cupful of clean well-soaked 
rice. When this is tender, it must be drained from 
the gravy, and placed upon an inverted sieve before the 
fire to dry, the fowl being meanwhile kept hot. The 
fowl is then served with the rice piled in light heaps 
round it, and parsley-sauce poured over it. In this 
dish green peas and lettuce may be substituted for the 
rice. White cabbage also, cut as for pickling, is some- 
times used in the same way along with pigeons. To 
fricassee Chickens, they must be cut in pieces as when 
carved at table, and then these pieces are seasoned with 
white pepper and salt, and dipped in egg before being 
sauteed. They are stewed very slowly in mutton or 
veal broth, seasoned with lemon-peel, onions, and a few 
sweet herbs. When the chicken is tender, the sauce is 
strained into a small clean saucepan, in which it is 
thickened with butter rolled in flour, and seasoned to 
taste with nutmeg. The yolks of one or two eggs, well 
beaten, and some cream, are then added to it, care being 
taken to mix these well with the sauce, which must not 
be made too hot, or it will curdle. The chicken, which 
has meanwhile been kept hot, is then served with this 
sauce poured over it, A slight flavouring of lemon- 
juice may be added if liked. 

Ducks, stewed as above along with peas, are a favou- 
rite dish. The peas should be put in, twenty minutes 
after the ducks. When peas are not in season, the 
gravy may be flavoured with sage and thyme finely 
shred. Ducks may be ragoued in a gravy drawn from 



76 DIRECTIONS FOR STEWING. 

the giblets. It should be highly seasoned and thickened 
with butter rolled in flour before serving*. 

Giblets. The Giblets of any kind of fowl make an 
excellent stew or ragout. They should be highly sea- 
soned, and the gravy thickened as above. 

Curry. Fowls, Rabbits, Veal, or any white meat, 
may be curried as follows : — The meat is cut up into 
rather small pieces, and then sauteed in butter in the 
stewpan over a smart fire along with some sliced onions. 
Whenit is lightly browned, some broth is added, in which 
it must stevv till about half done. The required quan- 
tity of curry powder, with a little flour, and a sufiiciency 
of salt, is then mixed smooth with a little cold water 
in a basin, and added to the stew, which must now be 
simmered till the meat is tender. It is then dished, 
the sauce being poured over it, and served with boiled 
rice prepared as directed on p. 54, either in a separate 
dish, or surrounding the curry in the same dish. 

Salmon, Cod, Haddock, or almost any kind of fish, 
may be curried by cutting them in slices, and again 
dividing these into smaller pieces about the size of a 
walnut, and then stewing them in a sauce made as fol- 
lows : — To some sliced onion sauteed in about an ounce 
of butter till shghtly yellow, add two table-spoonfuls 
of curry powder and a little flour, and then mix well 
with this about a pint of strong broth made hot. When 
the fish has stewed till cooked in tliis sauce, the super- 
fluous oil must be poured off, and the curry served with 
rice, as above directed ; a seasoning of lemon juice 
may, if liked, be added to the sauce immediately be- 
fore serving. Skate is the better of being plain boiled 
separately from the sauce, which, in this case, may be 
flavoured with an apple sliced and boiled to a pulp in it. 
When the skate is thoroughly drained from its liquor, 
and dished, the sauce, after being strained, is poured 
over it. 

■ The best mode re-warming all kinds of stews is to 
heat them in an earthen jar, immersed in a pot of boil- 
ing water.

CHAPTER X. 

DBESSING COOKED MEAT. 

In whatever way this is done, it must never be forgotten, 
as is too often the case, that the meat, being already 
cooked, requires merely to be warmed, and that if in 
doing this a heat sufficient to cook raw meat be applied 
to it, it will inevitably be spoiled by being overdone. 
The most usual method is that called Hashing, which 
if properly done will be found to produce a dish re- 
sembling a ragout, which is at once savoury, nutritious, 
and economical. 

Hashed Beef, Veal, or Mutton. These are prepared 
from cold roast beef, roast veal, and cold roast or boiled 
mutton ; if the meat is rather underdone, so much the 
better. Cut it from the bones in small thin slices, and 
trim away from them all the gristly and skinny parts.' 
Break the bones, and gently simmer these and the 
trimmings along with some sliced onion in a little 
water, so as to extract as much of their gravy as pos- 
sible. Eemove the bones and trimmings ; strain the 
sauce, add any of the roast-meat gravy that may be left, 
season with pejDperand salt, and thicken it with a small 
piece of butter rolled in flour. Then place the pieces 
of cold meat in it, and let the stewpan stand by the side 
of the fire till these are warmed through, when the hash 
is ready. The dish in which it is served may be lined 
with small strips of toasted bread. This plain hash may 
be more highly flavoured by the addition of sliced car 
rot, which should be put in along with the bones to 
allow it time to cook, and a few sweet herbs ; a little 
mushroom ketchup may also be added to the gravy 
before dishing. Hashed Veal may be flavoured with 
finely-minced lemon peel. The form of this hash may 
be varied by cutting the meat into very small dice. 
This mode is applicable to cold meat that has been so 
ill carved or so well used up that neat small slices can- 



78 DIRECTIONS FOR 

not be got from it. The mode of dressing it is precisely 
the same, only the meat will not take so long to warm 
through. When cold veal is dressed this way, some 
boiled ham or lean bacon cut small along with it makes 
a savoury addition. Cold roast lamb and venison may 
also be hashed as above, a little mutton broth being 
added to the sauce for the latter, which may also be 
flavoured with a little red currant jelly. 

Hashed Pork. The remains of roast pork, cut in 
small thin slices, dusted with flour, and seasoned with 
pepper and salt, may be heated in a sauce made as fol- 
lows : — Put into a stewpan two table -spoonfuls of 
chopped onion, a wine-glassful of vinegar, two cloves, a 
blade of mace, and a bay leaf. Simmer this till the 
vinegar is about half evaporated, then take out the 
seasonings, put in half a pint of hot broth or water, and 
add the pork. When this has simmered for about ten 
minutes it is ready for serving. A small quantity of 
mustard may be added to the sauce if desired. 

Hashed Hare. The cold roast hare is cut into pieces, 
the joints of the legs and shoulders being divided. A 
gravy is then prepared from the head, trimmings, &c., 
seasoned with pepper and salt, an onion, and a bouquet 
of sweet herbs, to which a little red currant jelly may be 
added. In this gravy the pieces of hare are warmed. 
The stuffing may be cut in slices and warmed in the 
gravy also, and when the hash is dished, these are placed 
as a garnishing round the edge. The sweet herbs 
should be removed from the sauce before dishing. 

Hashed Poultry, Game, or Rabbits. These, whether 
roast or boiled, are all treated in the same way as hashed 
hare. If boiled, some of the liquor they were boiled in 
may be used to make the sauce, being enriched by the 
necks, heads, &c. being stewed in it. It may also be 
thickened with butter rolled in flour. 

Hashed Duck or Goose. These birds make excellent 
hashes. Being cut in pieces as usual, they are warmed 
in a gravy prepared as follows : — Cut an onion into 
small dice and brown it slightly in a Httle butter in the 



DRESSING COOKED MEAT. 79 

stewpan ; mix a table-spoonful of flour with it, and then 
add by degrees a gravy prepared by stewing the neck, 
head, and trimmings, in about a pint of water. The 
sauce should be highly seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
ketchup, to which a little finely-shred sage may be 
added, era little of the stufling maybe used to thicken 
the sauce. 

Curry powder may be used as %n ingredient in any 
of the above hashes, in which case proportionally less 
pepper should be employed in the seasoning. Thus pre- 
pared, they may be served with rice like other curries. 

Cold Beef Olives may be made in the same way as 
directed on p. 73, with slices of very tender underdone 
roast beef. They are very slightly stewed, so as not to 
overcook them, in a gravy prepared as for a hash. 

Hashes, like stews, may be re- warmed in an earthen- 
ware vessel placed in a saucepan of boihng water. 

English Stew is made with any kind of cold butcher 
meat, as follows : — Cut the meat as for hash, sprinkle 
it with pepper, salt, and flour, and lay it in a dish. 
Strew among the meat some pickled cabbage or onions, 
or any kind of pickles. Then make a sauce of half a 
tea-cupful of water, a little of the pickle vinegar, a 
email quantity of mushroom ketchup, and any of the 
gravy belonging to the meat which may be preserved. 
Stir these ingredients well together, and pour the sauce 
over the meat. The dish is then set before the fire in 
a dispatch, or in the oven, and when the meat is heated 
through it is ready. 

Bubble and Squeak is made of cold salt beef and 
boiled cabbage. Thinnish slices of the beef, well 
peppered, are slightly sauteed in fresh butter. These 
are then kept warm before the fire, while the cabbage, 
which must be chopped small and seasoned with pepper 
and salt, is sauteed in the butter which remains in the 
frying-pan after doing the beef. The cabbage is then 
spread in a hot dish, and the beef laid on the top of it, 
and served hot. In this dish veal is a very good sub- 
stitute for salt beef. A good sauce for this is made by, 



80 DIRECTIONS FOR 

mixing some pickled cucumber and onion chopped 
small with melted butter, and slightlj flavouring it 
with mustard. 

Cold Beef, or Mutton, Broiled. The inside of a roast 
sirloin of beef or of a leg of mutton, being the most 
tender and juicy part, is the best for this. The more 
underdone it may be, the better. Cut the slices even 
and rather thick, an^ broil them quickly over or before 
(see p. 58) a strong clear fire, taking care that though 
slightly browned on the surface, they are merely warmed 
in the inside. They may be served in the same way 
as beef steaks, or with poached eggs laid upon them. 

Poultry and Game. The cold remains of any kind 
of roast or boiled poultry or game may be re-warmed 
by cutting them into neat small pieces, seasoning them 
well with pepper and salt, and sauteing them in oil or 
butter made rather hot. They may also be fried by dip- 
ping the pieces in a pancake batter, (see Chapter XII. 
Pancakes), and then immersing them separately in very 
hot dripping quite sufficient to cover them. When 
they are lightly browned, drain the fat from the pieces 
and dish them, piling them into a pyramid in the 
centre of the dish. A well-flavoured brown sauce may 
be poured over them. The pieces, before being dipped 
in the batter, may be seasoned by soaking them for 
half an hour in a mixture of two parts of vinegar, one 
of oil, with some minced onion, and pepper and salt. 

Devils. These must be considered rather as provo- 
catives of appetite than as articles of food. They may 
be made of the remains of roast poultry or game, — 
legs, rumps, backs, gizzards, &lq.. very highly seasoned 
with spices, and broiled. Remainder bones of butcher- 
meat and venison, having of course a little meat upon 
them, kidneys, and sometimes even fish bones, are also 
used for the same purpose. The seasonings used con- 
sist of salt, pepper, cayenne, curry powder, mushroom 
powder, anchovy powder — in fact, anything which the 
ingenuity of the cook can devise to impart strong 
flavour and pungency. The proportions employed 



DRESSING COOKED MEAT. 81 

must be regulated by the taste of the eater, always re- 
membering that the true characteristic of a devil is 
extreme heat and pungency. The meat is generally 
well scored and gashed, so as to present a larger sur- 
face for the reception of the seasonings, which must 
be well rubbed in. Devils are served hot and dry as a 
relish with wine. When taken otherwise, grill sauce, 
anchovy sauce, or any piquante sauce, may be served 
with them. Dry toast and rusks are a usual accom- 
paniment. 

Fritadella. This is an economical mode of making 
a very palatable dish out of the cold remains of any 
kind of cooked meat, poultry, or fish. Soak in cold 
water a quantity of the crumb of bread, equal in weight 
to the meat. Mince the meat along with a little fat. 
Put the bread into a clean cloth and press it as dry as 
possible. Fry {saucer) in butter a table-spoonful of 
chopped onion in a stewpan for about two minutes ; 
then add the bread, and stir it about with a wooden 
spoon. When becoming rather dry, put in the minced 
meat, with a seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and 
lemon peel, and keep stirring the whole till very hot. 
Then throw in, one at a time, two well beaten eggs ; 
incorporate them thoroughly with the mixture, and 
then pour it into a dish to cool. When cold, it is 
moulded into flattened balls about the size of small eggs ; 
these are then egged and bread-crumbed, and either 
sauteed or fried, and served hot, with a napkin under 
them, or with a border of mashed potatoes. 

li. B. Even the remains of a dish of vegetables which 
has been used with the meat may be mixed with the 
above ; being chopped up where necessary, and intro- 
duced along with the bread crumb, proportionally less 
of which may in that case be employed. 



82 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

CHAPTER XI. 
SOUPS AND SAUCEI 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

As most soups and many sauces consist mainly of the 
juice of meat dissolved in water, attention must be 
paid in making them, to the proper method of extract- 
ing that juice. Of course, as has been shown in a pre- 
vious chapter, this method is essentially different from 
that practised in cooking meat which is intended to be 
eaten. In order completely to extract its juice, the 
meat must be cut into very small pieces, put into cold 
water, and gradually heated till boiling. Indeed the 
more slowly the heat is applied the better, because cold 
water is really a more perfect solvent of the juice than 
hot water ; the heat being only necessary to cook the 
juice after it has been extracted, to coagulate the al- 
bumen, which is separated as scum, and to dissolve the 
gelatine. The juice may also be perfectly extracted by 
finely mincing the lean of raw meat, mixing it with 
cold water, and after allowing it to stand some time, 
straining it, and then subjecting the residuum of meat 
to strong pressure in a stout canvas bag, so as to squeeze 
out the last drop of moisture. The fluid thus obtained 
contains almost every particle of the savoury juice and 
soluble albumen of the meat, but it is deficient in the 
gelatine, which is necessary to give consistency to the 
soup. A very strong and stimulating beef-tea may how- 
ever be made by this latter method, — the liquor being 
of course seasoned with pepper and salt, boiled, and 
skimmed, and shred onion added if required. 

A broth prepared in the first of tlje above methods, 
so as to have a due proportion of gelatine, "forms the 
basis of most soups and sauces. For the former, 
especially for white soups, it is best made from veal, 



i 



FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES. 83 

which furnishes a larger amount of gelatine than most 
other meats ; and to supply flavour, in which the veal 
is rather deficient, some lean ham or bacon is added, 
the proportions used being about six pounds of veal 
and half a pound of bacon to two gallons of water. For 
sauces, more particularly for brown sauces, beef is the 
best, as having a richer flavour. Meat of any sort (bones, 
trimmings, &c.) may however be used for either ; and 
the liquor in which any kind of meat, except pork, has 
been boiled, may be used instead of water, in which case 
less meat will be required. The scum should be re- 
moved as soon as it rises, and all fat ought also to be 
skimmed off. In from three to four hours the juice 
will be thoroughly extracted, after which it is worse 
than useless to continue the boiling, because if the fi- 
bres of the meat begin to separate, they will destroy 
the transparency of the soup. The liquor is then 
strained, and becomes what in the language of the kit- 
chen is called Stock, which by the addition of the proper 
seasonings, vegetables, and colouring and thickening 
substances, may be converted into almost any kind of 
soup. This stock, boiled down till reduced to a rather 
thick fluid of a yellowish brown colour, becomes what 
is called Glaze, which forms a strong jelly when cold, 
and will keep good in that state for a considerable 
time. It is useful for making soups and sauces upon 
short notice, and also for various other purposes. In 
making this glaze, a second stock, made by boiling the 
meat over again in a smaller quantity of water, after the 
first stock has been extracted, is sometimes used. This 
second stock will contain perhaps a larger proportion 
of gelatine than the first one ; but if that has been 
properly made, the second will be very poor, except 
perhaps in the loose meat fibre. Portable Soup consists 
simply of a very strong gelatinous glaze, dried in the 
form of tablets similar to common or'lue. 



SOUPS. — Before proceeding to give specific receipts 
for these, we desire to call attention to the following 



84 DIRECTIONS FOR SOUPS. 

general remarks : — 1st, All soups made with the flesh 
of full-grown animals, and not containing many green 
vegetables, are the better of being kept for a day after 
being made, as their ingredients thus blend better to- 
gether. They should be kept in earthen vessels, and 
not covered up till quite cold. 2d, Soups made with 
young meat, and with a considerable proportion of green 
vegetables, are best when fresh made, because when 
kept they have a tendency to ferment. When it be- 
comes necessary to keep such soups for a day or two^, 
this tendency may be checked by boihng them up oc- 
casionally, and setting them aside in clean vessels. 3d, 
Great care should be taken that soup is not smoked 
either during the making or in re-warming, but more 
particularly during the latter process, when it is pecu- 
larly liable to that mishap. For this purpose the fire 
should be clear, and the pot-lid close-fitting. ith, 
The more volatile flavouring ingredients, such as ket- 
chup, aromatic spices, &c., ought not to added until 
the soup is nearly ready, otherwise much of their effect 
will be lost, and a larger quantity of them will be re- 
quired. All the other ingredients should have ample 
time to incorporate. 5th, When roots, such as carrot, 
turnip, &c., are intended to appear in slices in the soup, 
an hour's boihng will be sufficient to cook them ; but 
when they are intended merely to flavour and thicken 
the soup, in which case they are the better of being 
grated, they should be added at a very early stage of 
the making. 6th, In making brown soups, the best 
plan to give colour is to fry (sauter^) till well browned, 
a small portion of the meat used, along with some 
onions, before adding the water. This, though some- 
times apt to impair the transparency of clear soups, 
imparts the best flavour. Other methods of browning 
are also frequently employed — such as the addition of 
toasted bread, dark-coloured ketchup, and burnt meat 
or bones ; but these last are decidedly bad, because 
they impart a bitter burnt flavour. A very good 
browning substance, if carefully made, consists of 



CLEAR SOUPS. 85 

sugar heated in a stewpan until blackened, but not 
burnt, and then melted in water. The sugar ought to 
have lost its sweetness, but if too much heated it will 
become bitter, which must be avoided. A few drops of 
this browning will suffice. Flour browned in the oven 
is a very good colouring substance for soups that re- 
quire to be thickened as well. 1th, Should any clear 
soup turn out not so transparent as desired, it may be 
clarified as follows : — Whisk the white of eggs with a 
little cold water in a basin, to which add gradually some 
of the boiling soup, still whisking the mixture. Pour 
this slowly into the pot of boiling soup, which must be 
rapidly stirred at the same time. Continue stirring 
the soup till it again nearly boils, when it may be re- 
moved from the fire, and allowed to stand till the white 
of Qgg separates. If the soup is now strained through 
a clean cloth, it will be found perfectly clear. The 
number of eggs required is about one to each quart of 
soup. 

Clear Vegetable Soup. Peel some carrot and turnip 
and some small onions, cut the turnip and carrot into 
small dice of equal size, wash the whole in cold water, 
and drain th^m upon a sieve. When dry, place them 
in a saucepan with some butter and a tea-spoonful of 
powdered sugar over a quick fire. Let them fry (sau- 
ter) for about ten minutes, shaking them occasionally. 
When they become covered with a thin transparent 
glaze, neither milky-looking nor brown, pour over them 
two quarts of stock. When this begins to boil, set it 
by the side of the fire till the vegetables are quite ten- 
der, skimming off the butter as it rises to the surface. 
Season it according to taste, and serve it hot. 

A soup similar to the above may also be made with- 
out a previously prepared stock, by proceeding as direct- 
ed for making beef bouilli (p. 39.) If prepared in this 
way, of course a larger proportion of beef, veal, or mut- 
ton, as the case may be, will be required for the soup, 
than is used for the same quantity of stock, because it 
is treated so as to retain enough of juice to make it 



86 DIRECTIONS FOR 

eatable as boiled meat. For the ordinary requirements 
of a small household, this latter plan is perhaps the 
more economical, as the greater part of the meat em- 
ployed is fit for immediate use, and there results a 
smaller quantity of exhausted meat requiring some eco- 
nomical contrivance to use it up ; it is without doubt 
the least troublesome. If Veal be the meat employed 
in this way, shred parsley and a little rice may be added 
to the broth about half an hour before it is required ; 
and a piece of bacon boiled along with it not only im- 
proves the flavour of the soup, but makes a savoury ac- 
companiment to the veal. The bacon should be served 
separately in a dish along with some greens. In Mut- 
ton Broth, some pearl barley is a very good addition to 
the other vegetables. This must be put in along with 
the meat. 

Vegetable soups may be almost infinitely varied, by 
employing more or less of each kind of vegetable, or 
omitting some or most of them altogether, so as to have 
the flavour of one kind predominant. In this way there 
is hardly an edible vegetable or herb which may not be 
introduced ; and even some which cannot be used in 
any other way, such as nettles, flowers of marigold, &c. 
are frequently employed to impart their peculiar fla- 
vours and nutritious juices. As might be supposed, it 
would be utterly impossible to give names to each of 
these various compounds. Those in which any parti- 
culiar vegetable predominates, are of course called by 
the name of that vegetable : — thus we have turnip soup, 
cabbage soup, &c. All other sorts have been very well 
classified by the French cooks under the designations 
of the seasons or months of the year during which their 
vegetable ingredients are in full perfection : — thus they 
have Printa7iiere Souip, Julienne Soup, viz. Spring Soup, 
Jiili/ Soup, &c. 

Properly, there are two distinct kinds of vegetable 
soups, — the clear soups, and the thick, or puree soups; 
and a cook who knows the proprieties and elegancies of 
her art, will strictly preserve the distinction between 



CLEAR SOUPS. 87 

the two. In the clear soups, as the name implies, the 
liquor should be as transparent as possible, and the 
vegetables floating in it in small pieces as cut, distinct 
and undissolved. Thick soups, on the contrary, which 
are most frequently made with one vegetable predo- 
minant, have the whole ingredients reduced to a 
homogeneous thin pulp. This condition is easily 
attained by thorough cooking, and by rubbing the 
vegetables through a sieve or tammy. The chief 
difficulty lies with the clear soups. To secure success 
in these, attention must be paid to the various lengths 
of time required to cook the different vegetables 
thoroughly without their becoming dissolved ; and as 
this not only depends upon their kind, but also varies 
with their age, they must be added to the soup at 
different stages of its preparation accordingly. Besides 
this, the small pieces into which the larger kinds re- 
quire to be cut must be all as nearly as possible of the 
same size, otherwise the smaller pieces, being sooner 
cooked, will become dissolved while the larger ones are 
yet hard, and thus the transparency of the soup will 
be destroyed. Thus it will be seen that the making 
of clear vegetable soup in perfection, requires an 
amount of knowledge and j udgment which can only be 
acquired by experience. It must here be observed, 
however, that this nice distinction between clear and 
thick soups is entirely a matter of elegance and fashion, 
and consequently is not of so much importance in ordi- 
nary family cookery, as the wholesomeness and thorough 
cooking of the vegetable ingredients. 

Brown Soap is merely a good clear stock made from 
beef, and coloured to the required shade by one of the 
methods already described. It is seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and cayenne, and a little mushroom ketchup if 
desired. Toasted bread cut into small dice may be put 
into it before serving. 

Vermicelli, Italian Paste, Macaroni, Rice, Sago, Se- 
molina, and Tapioca Soups consist simply of well sea- 
soned clear stock with these substances boiled in it 



88 DIRECTIONS FOR 

without any vegetables. About two ounces of either 
of the first four is enough for a quart of stock ; rather 
less of the others will be sufficient, because they swell 
very much. They should be boiled till tender, but no 
more, as their dissolving would thicken the soup, The 
Rice being first well washed and drained, is put into 
cold stock, and this made to simmer about half an hour, 
or till the rice is sufficiently cooked : the others should 
all be put into the stock while boiling. Macaroni, which 
is the better of being previously boiled for ten minutes 
in water and then drained, will be ready in about half 
an hour ; Semolina, Tapioca, Sago, and Italian Paste, in 
twenty minutes ; while Vermicelli will not require above 
ten minutes' boiling. Instead of stock, Broivn Soup 
(see previous receipt) may be used for these sonps. 

THICK SOUPS.— Pwr^'e of Vegetable Soup is made 
of the same materials as Clear Vegetable Soup (see p. 
85.) These being cut very small, are sauteed as 
before, alon g with some lean ham or bacon. A spoon- 
ful of flour is then mixed with them, and the required 
quantity of stock poured over them, to which may be 
added a bunch of parsley and one or two potatoes. 
When this boils it is seasoned to taste with salt and 
sugar, and then rubbed through a tammy ; the ham and 
parsley being removed. It now only requires to be made 
to boil, and when skimmed, it is ready. Serve hot, with 
fried or toasted bread in it. Some milk may be added, 
which should be put in boiling hot along with the stock 

Palestine Soup is a puree soup in which artichokes are 
the principal ingredient. It is prepared and served 
exactly as above, omitting the carrot and potatoes alto- 
gether, and also the larger part of the other vegetables, 
and substituting an equivalent quantity of Artichokes. 
Celery, or celery seed, may be employed to flavour ic ; 
and as its colour ought to be pale, milk may be used in 
it, and some cream stirred in immediately before serving 
is considered an improvment. 
Puree of Cauliflower and Puree of Turnip Soups are

made precisely as the last, substituting Cauliflower and 
Turnip for artichokes. A very little more flour may be 
put into the latter. 

Crecy and Crecy a la Reine Soups are purees made 
with red Carrots and white Belgian Carrots respectively, 
instead of artichokes ; otherwise their ingredients are 
the same as those of Palestine Soup. For the former, 
the red part only of the carrots may be used, and this 
need not be sauteed along with the other vegetables, 
but added afterwards, if it is desired to have it of a 
fine red colour. 

Onion Soup. A high flavoured Onion Soup may be 
made by sauteing in butter till browned, a dozen or 
more largish onions sliced, and then adding about two 
quarts of brown soup, in which the onions are to be 
simmered till reduced to a pulp. Season rather highly 
with pepper, salt, and cayenne, — ginger may also be 
used, and curry powder is a very good spicing. The 
soup should be well skimmed, and may be thickened 
with a few split peas boiled till dissolved, or a piece of 
butter kneaded in flour. Onion Soup maigre is made 
by adding a little flour after the shred onions are 
sauteed, and then using water instead of brown soup. 
In this case the onions may simmer till tender but not 
dissolved. Season with a little salt and sugar, and im- 
mediately before serving, stir in the yolks of four eggs 
mixed with a little milk or cream. After this it must 
not boil, or the eggs will curdle. Pour it over strips 
of the crust of a French roll placed in the tureen, and 
serve hot. Another maigre soup is made by using 
fewer onions, and putting to them, after they are sau- 
teed, a few handfuls of sorrel well washed and cut into 
strips, along with some flour, and then adding a mix- 
ture of milk and water. It is finished in the same 
manner as the other. 

Potato Soup is best made with a stock extracted 
from mutton or beef. A weak stock made with scraps 
or bones of meat will do very well. Ten or twelve good 
sound potatoes, after being cleaned, pared, or scraped. 



90 DIRECTIONS FOR 

and cleared of specks and eyes, are sliced ; and, along 
with three or four onions also sliced, are simmered in 
about a gallon of the stock till completely dissolved. 
The soup is now seasoned with pepper and salt, a piece 
of butter added to it, and after simmering a few mi- 
nutes longer, it is ready for serving. This soup, if pro- 
perly made, should be rather thick, the dissolved pota- 
toes being completely diffused through the liquid. A 
little milk added to it improves its colour. It is very 
good made simply with water and a little dripping or 
butter, instead of stock. Sometimes potatoes have a 
rank flavour and smell, which may be removed by first 
slowly simmering them in water, and pouring off this 
water before they begin to dissolve. The soup is then 
made in the usual way. It may be passed through a 
sieve, but this will hardly be necessary if the potatoes 
are good, and the soup simmered long enough. 

Green Pease Soup. There are various modes of making 
this, one of which is as follows : — Put two quarts of 
shelled green peas into a deep stewpan, along with a 
few sprigs of parsley, two onions sliced, four ounces of 
lean ham cut small, and four ounces of butter. Add 
some cold water, stir the whole well together, and after 
pouring off most of the water, set the stewpan, closely 
covered, over a sharp fire, until the peas are quite ten- 
der, — stirring them occasionally. When perfectly soft, 
mash them with a spoon against the side of the pan, 
V adding a little flour while doing so. Then stir among 
them two quarts of stock, season with pepper, salt, and 
sugar, boil it for a few minutes, and rub it through a 
tammy or hair sieve. Return to the pan what passes 
through, boil it five minutes longer, and serve it hot 
with small dice of toasted bread in it. Another mode 
is to separate the young from the older peas while 
shelling them, and, reserving a pint of the young ones, 
to proceed as above with the rest, using instead of stock 
some water in which the younger pea-pods have been 
boiled. The reserved pint of young peas is added after 
the soup has been passed through the sieve or tammy, 



THICK SOUPS. 91 

and then boiled in it till tender, but not broken. A few 
leaves of mint may be added for those who like the fla- 
vour, and spinach is sometimes used to improve the 
colour. These should be boiled in it for a few minutes 
before rubbing it through the tammy. 

Winter Pease Soup. This is perhaps the cheapest of 
all soups, as it can be made very good without stock; 
using instead, merely the liquor in which any kind of 
meat has been boiled, or even water with a little butter 
or dripping, and any odd scraps of cooked or uncooked 
meat, bones, &c. boiled in it ; and even these latter may 
be dispensed with, and the soup still be excellent, though 
made simply with water, and butter or dripping. Wash 
two or three pounds of split peas, rejecting those which 
float, and put them into a saucepan with cold soft water 
(if the water is hard, a very small quantity of carbonate 
of soda will soften it), along with the meat, scraps, and 
bones well broken, and some turnip, carrot, and onion 
sliced, a bunch of thyme, and two or three heads of 
celery, or what does as well, a little celery seed. Let 
these boil slowly till the peas dissolve, stirring them 
frequently to prevent them from burning on the bottom 
of the saucepan, which they are very apt to do. The 
soup is then rubbed through a sieve and returned to 
the saucepan, seasoned with pepper and salt, boiled 
again for a few minutes, and then poured into the 
tureen, into which some toasted bread cut into dice 
has been thrown, and served hot. When pease soup is 
made with stock, or with boiled meat liquor, the peas 
should be first boiled till dissolved as above in soft water 
and these added afterwards. If some beef, or veal and 
bacon, be boiled in it to be eaten, no stock or meat 
liquor will be required. In whatever way made, it is 
always improved by a day's keeping, the vegetables not 
being in that case added to it till it is re-warmed on 
the day on which it is to be used. The longer the 
peas are boiled, the smoother and mellower the soup. 

Lentil Soup. Place in a stewpan three onions, a 
turnip and a small carrot cut into thin slices, a few 



92 DIRECTIONS FOR 

sprigs of parsley and thyme, and a bay leaf, along 
with any scraps of meat (beef is the best for the pur- 
pose) cut in small pieces, and some butter. Fry (saufer) 
these till quite brown, stirring them continually. Then 
add a quart of lentils and three quarts of water, and 
let them simmer till the lentils are tender. When they 
are quite soft, pour oiF the broth, add some flour to 
the lentils, and mash them in the stewpan ; then return 
the broth, boil it up, and continue stirring it while 
boiling. Lastly, rub the soup through a sieve, rewarm, 
and season it with pepper, salt, and sugar ; then skim 
it, and serve it hot, with toast cut as for pease soup. 
The lentils may be kept whole if desired, in which case 
the meat may he omitted, and boiled meat liquor, stock 
or brown soup, used instead of water, or a piece of 
meat may be boiled in it, to be eaten the same day. 
A very good Lentil Soup maigre may be made without 
meat, or even without lentils, using merely the water 
in which a dish of lentils has been boiled (see p. 55), 
by sauteing sliced onions in a stewpan, mixing some 
flour with them, and then adding the lentils and water, 
— or without lentils, pouring over them the lentil 
liquor ; — season to taste as above. 



STEW SOUPS, or Soups a la Fourchette.—Thesie 
are a class of soups in which the meat with which they 
are made is served in them in the form of small pieces 
or mouthfuls, not requiring the use of a knife and fork. 
In their ingredients and mode of preparation, most of 
them resemble ragouts. The best portions of the meat 
being intended to be eaten, are treated accordingly ; 
while the inferior parts and the bones are, where stock 
is not used, made to yield their juices to enrich the soup. 
The chief difference between these soups and ragouts 
is, that in the soups there is a larger quantity of liquid, 
a greater proportion of vegetables, and generally, though 
not in every case, less spice ; the meat also is served 
in smaller pieces, as it is to be eaten with a spoon. 
Ox-tail Soup. This may be made of two or three 



STEW SOUPS. 93 

ox-tails, divided into joints, slightly sauteed in butter, 
and then stewed in about three quarts of good beef 
stock, or brown soup, till the meat becomes quite ten- 
der, and is beginning to leave the bones. If no stock is 
used, but simply water, another tail may be taken, and 
part of the smaller pieces left unsauteed to yield their 
juice. It should be seasoned vi^ith whole black pepper 
and salt, v?^hich must be put in at the beginning of the 
preparation. Vegetables — as carrot, turnips, onions 
or leeks, and celery — sliced, and parsley and thyme, 
may be boiled in it, especially if it is made without 
stock ; the onions being sauteed along with the meat ; 
and it may be thickened with browned flour if desired. 

Kidney Soup is made with kidneys cut into slices, 
and cooked precisely as above. 

Ox- cheek Soup may be made similarly to the pre- 
ceding; two ox-cheeks being sufficient to make four 
quarts of soup. These should be well washed, blanched 
in boiling water, the meat cut from the bones, and di- 
vided into smallish pieces. The best, or cheek parts, 
are then slightly sauteed as above, along with some 
onion ; and a properly seasoned stock drawn from the 
bones (which should be broken for the purpose) and in- 
ferior pieces, is strained and poured over them ; vege- 
tables being added if desired. Another way is to keep 
the cheek pieces whole, omit the saut^ing, and cook 
them in the stock, as boiled meat (see pp. 37 and 38.) 
When cooked, they are cut into pieces of the requisite 
size, and served in the soup as usual. If this latter 
mode is adopted, the soup may be coloured with brown- 
ing (see pp. 84-85). Calf's Head Soup may be made 
in the same way. Being a white soup, the seasoning 
should be white pepper, — and rice may be added. 
Sheeps' and Lambs' heads also, treated as above, will 
produce a very good soup, with the addition of any 
kind of stock. 

Real Scotch Sheep' s-Head Broth is very different. It 
is not a stew-soup. The head and " trotters," which 
ought always to accompany it, not being skinned, have 



94 DIRECTIONS FOR 

the hair singed off with a red-hot iron by a blacksmith, 
an operation which not only gives the soup its peculiar 
flavour, but constitutes the first step of the cooking, 
being equivalent to the preliminary sauteing of stewed 
meat, or the first plunging into boiling water of boiled 
meat. After this they have to be thoroughly cleaned, 
by soaking in water, scraping, and scrubbing ; which 
operation is greatly faciUtated by smearing them, before 
soaking, with the slimy inside of the eyes. The head 
is then split down the middle, the brains removed, and 
the nose and root of the tongue cleaned out. It is 
again well washed, and is then ready for the pot. The 
broth is then made with the head and trotters, and 
two or three pounds of the neck, in the way described 
for houilli (p. 39.) Barley is always an ingredient in 
this broth, and old green or white peas are generally 
added ; young green peas, when in season, being of 
course preferable. The barley and old peas are put in 
along with the meat, as they require longer boiling 
than the other vegetables. When the head is tender, 
it is served separately from the broth, with the trotters 
round it, and garnished with some of the carrot and 
turnip, which should be kept in large slices for that 
purpose. 

Irish Soup is made with the scrag end of a neck of 
mutton, and potatoes. The meat is treated as directed 
on p. 39, and the potatoes and some onion, but no other 
vegetables, are sliced thin and boiled in the broth till 
reduced to a puree. Season with pepper and salt ; and 
before serving, cut the meat which is to be eaten, into 
pieces of a convenient size, and return it to the soup, 
which should not be quite so thick as potato soup. 

Mulligatawny Soup. Cut the meat of three pounds 
of a breast of veal into small pieces, and simmer the 
trimmings, gristles, and bones, along with a knuckle of 
veal broken in pieces, in about three quarts of water, 
until these are converted into a strong gelatinous stock. 
Fry (sauter) the pieces of meat in butter, in a deep 
stewpan, along with some sliced onion, and a slice of 



STEW SOUPS. 95 

lean ham. When slightly browned, add two table- 
spoonfuls of flour, mix well, and pour over them the 
stock previously strained. Allow this to simmer gently 
for nearly an hour, skimming off the fat as it rises. 
Then add two or three dessert-spoonfuls of curry pow- 
der, season with salt and cayenne to taste, and continue 
the simmering till the veal is thoroughly cooked. Be- 
fore serving, remove the ham. Carrot and turnip may 
be used in this soup if desired, being sliced and sauteed 
along with the meat and onion ; apples also are some- 
times employed in the same way. The remains of 
cooked fowls or rabbits, cut into pieces of the proper 
size, may be warmed up in this soup and served along 
with, or instead of, the veal. 

Mock Turtle Soup is also made with veal. Procure 
the half of a calf's head, not skinned, but well scalded 
and cleaned. Cut the meat from the bone, and then 
divide it into neat small peices. Make a strong gela- 
tinous stock from the bone and a knuckle of veal, both 
well broken, along with a quarter of a pound of lean ham, 
some carrot, turnip, and onion sliced, a little parsley, 
and a bay leaf. Fry (sauter) the meat of the head in 
butter in a deep stewpan, along with some sliced onion 
and some lemon thyme, and marjoram, tied together. 
When the meat is slightly browned, remove the herbs 
and add some flour, stirring it well with the butter ; 
then pour over it the stock, previously strained. Throw 
in the softer gristles and glutinous tendons of the 
knuckle cut in small pieces, and then stir the whole 
over the fire till it simmers. Skim off all the fat, sea- 
son the soup with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste, 
and when the pieces of meat are quite tender, it is 
ready to serve. Some cream may be stirred into it if 
liked, immediately before pouring it into the tureen. 

Hotch Potch is made with mutton, or ribs of lamb 
and a stock of mutton. Proceed as directed for Beef 
Bouilli (p. 39.) If Lamb is used, treat it so that it 
may be eaten ; that is to say, keep it whole and cook it 
so as to preserve its juices, in a stock made from mut- 



96 DIRECTIONS FOR 

ton. The vegetables used are young turnips, onions, 
lettuce, carrots, parsley and green peas. As the flavour 
of the soup ought to be sweetish, the carrots and peas 
should predominate over the rest, and the turnips are 
best of the sweet white kind. Half of the carrots used 
should be grated, and the rest, along with the other 
vegetables requiring it, cut in small pieces. Half of 
the peas should be put into the soup early, in order to 
be dissolved in it, and the other half reserved till near 
the end of the process that they may be kept whole. 
The older peas are the best for the former purpose, and 
the younger ones for the latter ; the two being se- 
parated in the process of shelling. When the lamb or 
mutton that is to be eaten is cooked, the meat must be 
taken out of the pot, the exhausted portion set aside 
for other purposes, and that which is eatable cut into 
pieces of the proper size and returned to the soup, 
which is then seasoned with white pepper and salt, re- 
warmed, and served. 

Hare Soup. Having well cleaned and cut up the 
hare into neat small pieces, select the best and most 
fleshy of these to be served in the soup ; and with the 
rest, including the blood of the hare, which should be 
preserved for this purpose in cleaning it, make about 
five quarts of stock, which may be farther enriched if 
desired by the addition of a piece of beef, and another 
of lean bacon. Then melt half a pound of butter in a 
large stewpan over a brisk fire, and stir into it three 
quarters of a pound of flour. When this has become 
slightly browned, throw in the reserved pieces of the 
hare, and continue stirring until these are firmed on the 
surface. Then pour the stock over them, add two 
onions, some parsley and thyme, a bay leaf, and a little 
celery seed ; and simmer it till the pieces of hare are 
thoroughly cooked, — skimming ofl" the butter which 
rises to the surface. When done, remove the bones, 
rub the soup through a fine sieve, season it with pepper 
and salt, revvarm, and serve it hot. It may be thickened 
by the addition of some of the pieces of hare which 



STEW SOUPS. 97 

have been used in making the stock, pounded to a paste 
in a mortar. Rabbits, pheasants, partridges, or other 
game, may be made into soup in the same way. 

Cock-a-Leehie. This is made, as its name implies, 
with a fowl and leeks, and some clear stock. Althoug^li 
a stock made from the shin of beef is generally recom- 
mended, yet any kind of stock, or even the liquor in 
which meat has been boiled, will make excellent soup, 
if the fowl be a good-sized one. If a large old fowl be 
used, as is frequently the case, it is the better of being 
stewed for a short time before making the soup. Two 
or three dozen of fine winter leeks are about the quan- 
tity employed ; but this of course must depend on the 
size of the leeks and the taste of those who are to par- 
take of the soup. Being well washed, and trimmed of 
their roots and the coarser part of the green leaves, they 
are cut into pieces an inch long, and half of these added 
to the boiling stock along with the fowl, which is trussed 
and treated as if for boiling. When the fowl is cooked. 
it is lifted out, and the rest of the leeks put in. The 
fowl is then cut into pieces of the required size, the 
bones removed if thought necessary, and when the 
second half of the leeks is tender, the pieces of fowl are 
returned to the soup, which is then seasoned with pep- 
per and salt, re-warmed, and served ; — the first half of 
the leeks being now of course reduced to a pulp, the 
soup does not require any other thickening. If the 
flavour of the leeks is thought too strong, the half of 
the above quantity may be omitted, and an equal pro- 
portion of shred greens substituted in their stead. 

Gihlet Soup. Two sets of goose giblets, well cleaned, 
cut in small pieces, and slightly sauteed in butter, are 
simmered till tender in some good beef stock, or brown 
soup, along with some carrot, turnip, onions, parsley, 
thyme, and bay leaves. The soup is seasoned rather 
highly with mushroom ketchup, salt, and cayenne, and 
thickened with butter kneaded in flour. When the 
giblets are quite tender, but not over-cooked, the soup 
may be strained ; and when re-Wcirmed, it is served with 

H 



98 ' DIRECTIONS FOR 

the giblets, and, if desired, some of the vegetables in 
small pieces in the tureen along with it. 

Pigeon Soup. The livers and gizzards of the pigeons 
are first boiled for half an hour in some good stock of 
any kind. The pigeons are then trussed, seasoned, 
sauteed, and cooked in this stock precisely as directed 
for stewed pigeons on page 75. The soup may be 
thickened with butter rolled in flour, and seasoned with 
white pepper and salt. When thoroughly tender, the 
pigeons should be cut up, the bones removed, the meat 
divided into small pieces and returned to the soup, 
which after being re-warmed, is then served. 



FISH SOUPS. — Where a stock is required for these, 
it may be made either from meat or fish. The latter 
is to be preferred as being more in accordance with the 
nature of the soup. It may be made from any kind of 
white fish, or more economically by boiling down some 
of the liquor of boiled fish until considerably reduced 
in quantity, enriching it at the same time by the ad- 
dition of the trimmings, — heads, fins, &c. of the fish 
which are to be served in it. This must be strained 
before using ; and as fish stock soon becomes sour when 
kept, it ought not to be made until required. An ex- 
cellent fish soup may be made by flavouring some stock 
made as above, with onions, grated lemon-peel, thyme, 
and parsley, seasoning it with pepper, salt, and ket- 
chup, thickening it with butter kneaded in flour, or 
oatmeal, and finally straining it. If desired, smaU 
square pieces of any kind of fish, fried, may be served in 
it. It then goes by the name of the fish used ; — Had- 
dock Soup, Skate Soup, &c. 

Crapjnt Heads. This excellent Scotch dish is made 
as follows : — Having well cleaned and prepared as fc 
boiling three or four middling-sized haddocks or whi- 
tings, cut ofl" the heads and divide the bodies into three 
parts of equal length. Then stuff the heads and the 
shoulder-pieces with a forcemeat made thus : — Mince 
finely a few small onions, and mix these with the melts 



FISH SOUPS, 99 

of the fish and as much well-dried oatmeal as will make 
the whole into a stiff paste ; season this with pepper 
and salt, and, when stuffed into the heads &c., secure it 
by tying a piece of coarse thread round them. Put the 
stuffed pieces into boiling water, a little more than will 
just cover them, and after about ten minutes boiling, 
add the tail pieces. When these are sufficiently cooked, 
take out the fish, and after removing the threads from 
the stuffed pieces, place it in a tureen ; then season the 
liquor with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and if not suffi- 
ciently thickened with the stuffing it may have dis- 
solved, put a piece of butter kneaded in flour into it, 
and when this is thoroughly mixed, re-warm the soup, 
pour it over the pieces in the tureen, and serve it. 

Eel Soup. For this, the eels being well cleaned, 
must be cut in pieces, but need not be skinned. They 
are first sauteed in batter till slightly coloured, along 
with some sliced onion. Boiling water is poui'ed over 
them in the proportion of about a quart to every pound 
of eels, and when this boils it must be carefully skim- 
med. Parsley and tiijme are next added, after which 
it must simmer under a close cover for about two hours; 
when it may be strained, seasoned with black pepper 
and salt, thickened vrith a mixture of butter and flour, 
re- warmed, and serve >1. Small pieces of any kind of 
white fish or eels, sau':eed, may be served in it. 

Lobster Sou}:). Boil two good hen lobsters, and when 
cold, split the tails and crack the large claws, and re- 
moving the meat, cut it into pieces to be served in the 
soup. Pick the meat from the chines, bruise the re- 
maining husks and tlie small claws, and simmer them 
for twenty minutes in about two quarts of veal or cow- 
heel stock, which having by that time extracted their 
flavour, may then be strained. To thicken it, pound 
in a mortar the meat picked from the chines, the spawn, 
the soft part of the bodies, and part of the coral, along 
with a little butter and flour, and when these are 
thoroughly incorporated and reduced to a pulp, add 
the stock to it gradually. When well mixed, pass the 



100 DIRECTIONS FOR FISH SOUPS. 

soup through a sieve, season it with pepper, cayenne^ 
and salt if necessary, and re-warm it. Then put the 
pieces of meat from the tails and large claws, and the 
remainder of the coral cut into similar pieces, into the 
soup tureen, pour the soup over them, and serve it im- 
mediately. In order to secure the fine red tint which 
lobster soup ought to have, and which is produced by 
the spawn, it is as well to remove this from the lobsters 
before boiling them, and use it raw in thickening the 
soup, because when much cooked, it is very apt to 
have its colour impaired. 

Sometimes forcemeat balls are served in this soup. 
These are composed of part of the corals and of the meat 
from the chines, pounded along with the yolks of two 
eggs, a little flour, and a seasoning of grated lemon- 
peel, nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, to which an anchovy 
may be added. This forcemeat, made into little balls, 
may be slightly fried before putting it into the soup. 
Onions also may be added, but these should be boiled 
in the stock along with the chine, husks, &c., so that 
they may be thoroughly cooked. 

Oyster Soup. Put half a hundred oysters along with 
their liquor into a stewpan, and heat them gently until 
beginning to simmer, taking care not to over-heat or 
boil them, which would make them tough. Then drain 
them upon a sieve, catching the liquor in a basin be- 
neath. Take off the beards, return these to the liquor, 
and put the oysters into the soup tureen, as they will 
require no more cooking. Melt in a stewpan a quarter 
of a pound of butter, and mix Avith it about six ounces 
of flour. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes (but 
do not let it become browned), and then allow it to cool. 
Add to this the liquor and beards of the oysters, two 
quarts of good veal stock, and one of milk. Stir the 
whole over the fire till it boils ; season it with pepper, 
cayenne, and salt, to which may be added a little essence 
of anchovies ; after it has boiled for about ten minutes, 
skim it, add a gill of good cream, strain it through a 
hair sieve into the tureen containing the oysters, and 



DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 101 

serve it hot. Similar soups may be made of mussels, 
cockles, and other shell-fish ; but it must be borne in 
mind that in this as in all other modes of cooking them, 
these fish will most certainly become tough and indi- 
gestible by being hoiled. They should merely be made 
hot. ■' 

SAUCES. — These are liquid preparations used to 
give relish to dishes. They are of various kinds. Some 
are sweet, others are salt, and a few are a mixture of 
sweet and acid. Of the salt kind, many are strong fla- 
voured, and of a dark colour, being composed chiefly of 
concentrated meat-gravy, or the juice of the more pun- 
gent vegetables and herbs, such as onions ; while there 
are others which are more bland, and whose purpose is 
merely to impart a cream-like richness to the viands 
they accompany. The sweet-and-acid kind are used 
rather sparingly when applied to meat, for their object 
is merely to modify slightly the natural flavour ; pro- 
ducing an eff'ect similar to the haiit gout which results 
from long keeping. They are mostly used with game. 
Sweet sauces are employed principally with sweet 
puddings. 

The composition and proper application of sauces is 
a branch of cookery to which, stimulated no doubt by 
the demands made upon them by the jaded epicurism 
of those for whom they cater, professional cooks, am- 
bitious of artistic fame, most assiduously apply them- 
selves. To invent a sauce, and thereby perpetuate their 
name, is the great object of their aspiration. The re- 
sult has been, as before observed, that while remarkable 
progress has been made in the art of merely pleasing the 
palate, that of producing wholesome food has been com- 
paratively neglected. Now although these objects are by 
no means incompatible, yet as this work professes to be 
devoted more particularly to the latter, its receipts for 
sauces will not be found very numerous. It will how- 
ever contain directions for making those which are in 
most general use, including all that are specially re- 
ferred to in the previous chapters. 



102 DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 

Melted Butter. Put into a small saucepan two ounces 
of soft fresh butter, and a large table-spoonful of flour. 
Mix these well together while cold, with a wooden 
spoon, and then add about half a pint of cold water, 
nearly a tea-spoonful of salt, and a little pepper. Set 
this over the fire, and stir it continually till nearly boil- 
ing, when it is ready for use. The ingredients ought 
to be perfectly blended, and in this the chief difficulty 
occurs in the case of the butter, which, from bad quality 
or other causes, will frequently float as oil on the sur- 
face. This imperfection may be partially remedied by 
adding a very little cold water, and then pouring the 
sauce quickly backwards and forwards from the sauce- 
pan into the basin. Prepared as above, melted butter is 
the basis of a large number of sauces, the distinctive 
flavouring or other ingredients being added as required. 
Thus a little ketchup and vinegar will convert it into 
a very good plain fish sauce. It must be observed that 
where the additions are fluid, the melted butter ought 
to be made rather thick by using less water; and the 
reverse, v,^here the addition, as in egg sauce, tends of 
itself to thicken the sauce. Acids when mixed with 
melted butter are apt to make it "oil;" to prevent this 
they must be well stirred in. When it is desired that 
the colour of the sauce should be very delicate, milk 
may be used instead of water in preparing the melted 
butter. The following sauces are all made with melted 
butter. 

Onion Sauce. Peel the onions, boil them till soft, 
then mince them very fine, and stir them into hot melted 
butter. This sauce may be used to " smother" rabbits 
instead of that described on page 46. The sauce recom- 
mended for roast mutton will be found on page 105. 

Parsley Sauce. Boil till tender a bunch of well- 
washed and picked parsley ; then removing the larger 
stalks, mince the leaves finely, and stir them into 
melted butter made hot. 

Fennel Sauce consists of melted butter with some 
chopped fennel mixed with it. 



DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 103 

Caper Sauce is made by mixing with melted butter 
some capers, together with a little of their pickle-vine- 
gar. If half the quantity used be minced, the flavour 
will be better developed. Lemon-juice may be added 
to this if a stronger acid is liked. 

Gherkin Sauce consists of melted butter with a few 
pickled Gherkins minced and stirred into it. Pickled 
Nasturtiums may also be used in the same way. This 
is sometimes called Mock Caper Sauce. 

Lemon Sauce. Pare a lemon, removing as much ot 
the white part of the rind as possible ; cut it quickly 
into thick slices with a sharp knife, divide these into 
small dice, and stir them into melted butter. 

N. B. — For cutting and mincing lemon or pickles, 
a silver knife is the best, as the acid does not corrode 
it. 

FISH SAUCES. — Zo6s^er Sauce. Pound into a 
smooth paste in a mortar, the spawn and coral of a 
boiled lobster, along with a piece of fresh butter. Eub 
this through a sieve, and mix it smoothly with melted 
butter ; add some of the meat from the tail cut into 
small dice, and then stir the sauce over the fire till 
quite hot, but not boiling. This sauce may be seasoned 
with cayenne and ketchup, pickle-vinegar, &c. These 
however may be added at table by those who like them. 

Shrimp Sauce. Procure some boiled shrimps, remove 
the heads and shells, and boil these for twenty minutes 
in water sufficient for the sauce. Strain this, and with 
it make some melted butter (p. 102), to which add the 
bodies of the shrimps. Season with a little cayenne and 
salt if required, and then rewarm it as in the last. 

Oyster Sauce. Heat the oysters in their liquor till 
just beginning to simmer ; then drain them, take off 
the beards and return these to the liquor. With this 
make some melted butter (see page 102), adding a little 
milk if desired ; season it with pepper, salt, and a very 
little cayenne, and strain it. To this add the oysters, 
and then re-warm it. — Mussel sauce is made in the 
same way. 



104 DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 

Egg Sauce. Cut the whites and jolks of a couple of 
hard-boiled eggs into small dice separately, and add 
first the whites, and then the yolks, to some thinnish 
melted butter (p. 102), placed over the fire, allowing 
the whites to become heated before putting in the yolks, 
else these latter will be too much dissolved. 

Anchovy Sauce. After removing the bones, pound 
the anchovies with a little butter into a smooth paste, 
and stir this into some thin melted butter (p. 102). 
This sauce may be highly seasoned with hot spices and 
condiments, such as cayenne, mustard, horse-radish, 
il'c; and lemon-juice or pickle-vinegar may also be in- 
troduced. It may likewise be made by flavouring melted 
butter with essence of anchovies. 

Besides the fish sauces above described, an economi- 
cal cook may contrive others equally good for ordinary 
family use from the trimmings of the fish she is dressing. 
Thus, when frying or sauteing fish, she may boil the 
heads, fins, bones, and livers, and so produce a well fla- 
voured liquor, which when strained, thickened with 
butter kneaded in flour, and properly seasoned with 
ketchup and curry powder or other spices, constitutes 
an excellent plain fish sauce. It may be farther en- 
riched with some of the liver chopped, and the roe 
pounded, and stirred into it while being made hot pre- 
vious to serving. 

White Sauce is made of clear stock prepared from 
veal or fowls. This is boiled with lemon-peel, onion, 
pepper, nutmeg, salt, parsley, thyme, and a little lean 
bacon ; and when properly seasoned, it is strained, and 
thickened with butter kneaded in flour. A little lemon- 
juice may be stirred into it just before serving. 

Beef Gravy. Cut a pound or a pound and a half of 
lean beef into thin slices, and hack or score these to 
facilitate the escape of the juice. Butter the bottom 
of a stewpan, in which place the meat along with some 
sliced onion and a small piece of bacon. Brown these 
gently over the fire, shaking the pan occasionally to 



DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES, 105 

prevent the meat from sticking to the bottom. Then 
cover the pan closely, and keep it hot by the side of the 
fire for about half an hour ; after which put in about a 
pint of hot water, and some whole pepper, and make 
this simmer slowly for a couple of hours longer. The 
gravy thus made, when seasoned to taste with salt, 
and strained, is ready for use. If prepared for brown 
sauce, beef gravy may be more highly flavoured by 
means of sliced carrot, celery, and a bay leaf saut^ed 
along with the beef, and a little mushroom ketchup 
added when nearly finished. 

Brown Sauce may be made of beef gravy prepared 
as above, and thickened with butter and flour. This 
thickening may be applied in various ways. The sim- 
plest is merely to knead the butter and flour together 
into a paste, and mix it with the boiling gravy. In 
large establishments where sauces are constantly being 
made which require this thickening, large quantities 
of the mixture are made at once, by melting the butter 
and stirring in the flour over a brisk fire till it forms a 
paste of a deep yellow colour. Thus prepared, it is 
called, in the language of the French kitchen, Roux, 
and may be kept good for a considerable time in 
covered earthen jars. The gravy for brown sauce may 
be made more gelatinous, and consequently of a richer 
consistency, though less highly flavoured, by substituting 
some veal for part of the beef used in preparing it. 

Brown Onion Sauce. Peel and slice some large 
Spanish onions ; and along with a little butter, salt, and 
flour, put them into a closely-covered stewpan over a 
slow fire to stew and become browned, shaking the pan 
occasionally to turn them about and prevent their burn- 
ing. In about an hour and a half, add a little water 
or stock, season with pepper and cayenne, and stew 
them a little longer. The onions yield a rich gravy ; 
and when reduced to a pulp, the whole may be passed 
through a sieve, re-warmed, and served. The addition 
of some French mustard to this, converts it into Sauce 
Robert ; English mustard gives a different flavour. 



106 DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 

Brown Mushroom Sauce. Slice a few well-cleaned 
small muslirooms, and place them along with a little 
butter, salt, pepper, and lemon-juice, in a stewpan over 
a slow fire. When they have sauteed for a few 
minutes, add some beef gravy, and boil this till the 
mushrooms are tender, when the sauce is finished. A 
little mushroom ketchup may be added. For white 
meats, a White Mushroom Sauce may be made in the 
same way, using only the white parts of the mushrooms, 
and substituting a white stock and a little milk for the 
beef gravy; — of course ketchup, because of its dark 
colour, should not be introduced into this. 

Cucumber Sauce. Pare and slice the cucumbers, and 
remove the seeds. Stew them till reduced to a pulp 
in a little good stock, seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
cayenne. Thicken the sauce with a paste of butter and 
flour, pass it through a fine sieve, and re-warm it. 

Celery Sauce. Wash well, and cut into slices about 
two inches long, a fresh young head of celery, and boil 
it till tender in weak broth or water. Season this with 
white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, and thicken it with a 
mixture of butter and flour. Another simple celery 
sauce consists of melted butter made with a decoction 
of celery seed, and seasoned as above. 

Bread Sauce. Soak grated bread-crumbs in some 
white stock, and then simmer them along with a sliced 
onion, some white peppercorns, cloves, and a little salt. 
When the sauce is sufficiently seasoned, remove the 
onion and spices, and serve it hot. 

Grill Sauce. Make rather thick with a paste of 
butter and flour, some good beef gravy, and season it 
highly with lemon-juice, ketchup, a little cayenne, and 
a tea-spoonful each of made mustard, essence of ancho- 
vies, minced onion, and grated lemon peel. This is 
appropriate to devilled fowl, &c., and may be used with 
fish by those who require a stimulating sauce. 

Horse-radish Sauce. Mix finely scraped or grated 
horse-radish with vinegar, and add a little salt. Some 
cream may be introduced if desired, and mustard is 



DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 107 

sometimes added ; but if the horse-radish is good, the 
sauce will be pungent enough without this last addition. 

Apple Sauce. Pare, core, and slice four or five 
juicy baking apples, and cook them till tender, along 
with a piece lemon-peel, in an earthen jar placed in 
a pot of boiling water. The pot should be closely 
covered, and care must be taken that none of the water 
enters the jar containing the apples. When the apples 
are sufficiently softened, remove the lemon-peel, and 
beat them to a pulp along with a little butter, at the 
same time sweetening them to taste with sugar. 

Green Gooseberry Sauce is made in the same manner 
as the above, with small green gooseberries, their tops 
and stalks being of course clipped off. A little ground 
ginger and vinegar may be added. 

Mint Sauce consists of fresh young leaves of mint 
finely minced and mixed with vinegar and sugar. 

Currant-jelly for Venison &c., may be served either 
melted or not in a small sweatmeat glass. 

Sharp Sauce for Venison is made by dissolving loaf 
sugar in white vinegar. This is also a very good sauce 
for cold salt beef; and when made very sweet, with ground 
cinnamon added, it is a dehcious sauce for pancakes. 

Custard Sauce for Sweet Puddings and Fruit Pies or 
Tarts. — Heat in a very clean saucepan, till just about 
to boil, a pint of new milk. Beat together in a basin 
the yolk of two eggs, a little cream, and some pounded 
loaf sugar. Pour over this the hot milk, and imme- 
diately return the whole to the saucepan, and continue 
pouring it from the saucepan into the basin and back 
again until thoroughly mixed. Lastly, return it to the 
saucepan, set it over the fire, and stir it continually till 
nearly boiling. Serve it cold in a glass dish or jug, 
with nutmeg grated over the top. 

Caudle Sauce for Plum Pudding, &c. — With some 
thick melted butter made with very little salt, mix a 
glass of sherry wine, half a glass of brandy or rum, 
some loaf sugar, part of which has been rubbed upon 



108 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

lemon-peel till saturated with its juice, and a little 
ground cinnamon. Make the sauce hot, and serve it 
with some ground cinnamon sprinkled on the top. 



CHAPTER XII. 
PUDDINGS, PASTRY, &c. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR PUDDINGS. 

There are two kinds of Puddings — viz. Boiled Puddings 
and Baked Puddings. The former are boiled in a cloth, 
or in an ornamental mould, from which they are turned 
out upon the dish in which they are served. The 
latter are either baked in the dish in which thej are to 
be presented at table, or in a mould from which they 
may be turned out. 

BOILED PUDDINGS.— The cloth used for these 
should be of stout and tolerably fine Hnen. Before 
putting the pudding into it, the cloth should be dipped 
in boiling water, and after wringing it out — not too 
dry, — it must be spread out smoothly inside a basin 
that will just hold the pudding, the edges of the cloth 
of course hanging over the sides of the basin. It is then 
pretty thickly dredged with flour over the part that 
will come in contact with the pudding. This dredg- 
ing prevents the pudding adhering to the cloth, and so 
causing a difficulty in turning it out. When the pudding 
is placed in it, the edges of the cloth must be gathered 
together equally tight all round, and securely fastened 
with a piece of strong twine passed three or four times 
round them and tied. The neat round shape of the pud- 
ding depends upon the cloth being gathered up equally 
tight all round ; if this is not attended to, and one 
part happens to be slacker than the rest, the pudding, 
when it swells to fill the cloth, will have an unsightly 
protuberance moulded upon it by this looser portion. 



FOR BOILED PUDDINGS. 109 

Where the pudding consists of such materials as 
dried fruits and farinaceous substances, which absorb 
water and swell considerably in the cooking, the cloth 
must not be tied close upon it, but so as to leave room 
for this increase of size without the risk of bursting. 
The extra room required varies with the kind of pud- 
ding ; but in no case ought it to be greater than what 
the pudding, when cooked, will tightly fill; otherwise it 
will not turn out solid, but by absorbing too much 
water, become converted into an incoherent mess. This 
sort of pudding requires also a very long time to boil : 
— three hours at least for a small one of three pounds 
weight, and upwards according to size. It is a maxim 
with cooks generally, that they cannot be boiled too 
long, and indeed there is always less risk of spoiling 
them by over-cooking than by under-cooking. 

Meat and Fruit puddings must be tied as closely as 
possible, and the former should not be boiled longer 
than is sufficient to cook the meat. 

To take the boiled pudding out of the cloth without 
breaking it : — Dip it into cold water for a minute or 
two, and then place it in a basin that will just contain 
it, and after untying the cloth and laying bare the pud- 
ding down to the edge of the basin, place the dish on 
which is to be served, bottom upwards, on the top of 
it, invert the whole so that the pudding may rest in 
the dish ; lift off the basin and remove the cloth care- 
fully. The use of the cold water is to chill and sohdify 
the surface so that it may part from the cloth smoothly 
and without being broken 

When puddings are boiled in a mould, this is either 
placed in a well-covered pot containing water to half 
the depth of the mould ; or, the mould being filled to 
the brim with the pudding, a cloth is stretched over 
its mouth and tied under the bottom, and it is then 
boiled in a full pot. For some of the lighter kinds of 
mould-puddings the former mode is best adapted. 

Every pudding in a cloth should be boiled in plenty 
of water in a pot large enough to allow it to move 



110 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

about freely. The ebullition should be brisk and con- 
stant until finished. 

After use, the pudding-cloth must be washed per- 
fectly clean, rinsed in pure water, and thoroughly dried 
before laying it aside for a future occasion. 

Suet Dumpling. This is the simplest of all boiled 
puddings. Its ingredients form the basis of nearly the 
whole class. They consist of one part by weight of 
finely-minced suet to four of wheaten flour ; which 
being well mixed together, are seasoned with a little salt, 
kneaded into a stiff dough with water, and the mass 
then divided into solid dumplings or balls of about three 
inches diameter. These do not require a cloth, but are 
simply put into a pot of boiling water, and boiled for 
at least half an hour. The pot ought to be sufficient- 
ly large to allow the dumplings to move about in it, and 
they should be kept so moving by the brisk ebullition 
of the water, else they will stick together or adhere to 
the bottom of the pot, and so become burnt. These 
dumplings make a substantial accompaniment to either 
roast or boiled meat. With the former, slices of cold 
dumpling, re-warmed in the dripping pan while the 
meat is roasting, are excellent. 

Currant Dumpliiigs are made in the same manner 
as the above, with the addition of currants {ad libitum) 
scalded, washed, and picked, a little sugar or treacle, 
and a slight seasoning of grated nutmeg and ground 
cinnamon. They are served either plain, or with caudle 
sauce ; or sliced, and with sugar, treacle, or jam spread 
over the slices. They may be made richer by using a 
larger proportion of suet, introducing an egg for every 
pound of the other ingredients, and making the dough 
with milk instead of water. The eggs should be well 
beaten and mixed with some milk ; which being worked 
up first, more milk may be added if necessary. 

Currant Pudding is composed as above, but with 
more eggs and milk ; and bread crumbs may be substi- 
tuted for the flour. The ingredients should be well 
mixed, and form a thick batter, which is then boiled 



PLUM PUDDING. Ill 

in a floured cloth securely tied, but so as to give the 
pudding room to swell. 

Plum Pudding is similar to the last, but richer. 
Stone (that is to say, cut out the seeds of) a pound of 
raisins, and wash and pick free from stones the same 
quantity of currants. Mince very small a pound of 
beef suet (some marrow substituted for part of the suet 
is considered an improvement), and mix with this, in a 
large basin, a pound of stale bread-crumbs and half a 
pound of wheaten flour. Beat together in another 
basin six eggs (seven if small), and mix with them 
about half a pint of new milk. Pour this mixture 
among the suet and flour, and stir and beat the whole 
well together. Then add the currants and raisins, and 
a seasoning of one ounce of ground cinnamon, half that 
quantity of powdered ginger, a grated nutmeg, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a pound of sugar. This 
makes an excellent pudding, but it may be made richer 
by introducing more fruit and eggs, and an addition of 
a quarter of a pound of candied citron and lemon-peel 
cut in small thin strips, with a glass of rum or brandy. 
— Another much cheaper, yet still very excellent Plum 
Pudding, may be made without eggs, by mixing equal 
quantities of grated carrot, boiled potatoes, wheat-flour, 
currants, and raisins, and seasoning them as above. 
Oatmeal may also be introduced into this instead of 
part of the flour. If Sidtana raisins are used, the 
trouble of stoning them is avoided. 

Plum Pudding may be boiled either simply in a cloth 
or in an ornamental mould tied up in a cloth (see 
pp. 108-9.) In either way it requires very long and 
constant boiling ; — six hours at least for one as large 
as the above. It is also sometimes baked in a mould. 
In this case the mould should be buttered inside before 
pouring in the pudding ; and two hours baking will 
sufiice. The pudding is improved if the mixture stands 
for a day previous to being cooked. 

It is a custom in England at Christmas time, to or- 
nament the plum pudding vv^ith a sprig of holly stuck 



112 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

into the top, and after pouring a quantity of spirits 
over it, to set fire to this in the dish, and serve it blazing. 
Although this fiery sauce may amuse a Christmas juve- 
nile party, yet the pudding is thereby spoiled for those 
who dislike the spirit flavour. It is therefore better 
omitted, so that each person may help himself or not 
as he pleases to a small quantity of brandy or other 
liqueur with which to flavour his pudding. Caudle sauce 
is also sometimes taken with plum pudding, though it 
is oftener preferred plain. 

A good plum pudding will keep {if not eaten) a very 
long time. Slices of it broiled, or merely re-warmed 
before the fire, are excellent. 

Roll or Bolster Pudding. Make about two pounds 
of suet and flour paste as directed for suet dumpling 
(p. 110.) Roll it out on a well floured paste board or 
slab, into a sheet about half an inch thick, and about a 
foot broad. Spread over it any kind of jam or mar- 
malade, keeping this about an inch and a half within 
the edges. Wet the edges, roll up the paste from the 
end, press the ends of the roll slightly so as to make 
the wetted parts adhere, roll it up in a floured cloth 
about three inches wider than the length of the pud- 
ding, and tie pieces of string tightly round the project- 
ing ends of this. Boil it nearly two hours, and when 
done remove the cloth, cut the pudding into slices, and 
serve it either plain or with a sweet sauce poured over 
it. Raisins and currants prepared as for plum pud- 
ding may be used instead of jam. A mixture of sugar 
and ground cinnamon also, or even simply treacle, em- 
ployed in the same way, makes a very good Roll Pud- 
ding. 

Rice Pudding. Boil eight table-spoonfuls of well- 
washed rice in sufficient water to cover it, stirring it 
frequently to prevent its burning, until considerably 
swelled and becoming rather dry. Then mix with it 
two ounces of butter or finely-minced suet, the same of 
bread-crumbs, two beaten eggs, and enough of milk to 
increase the bulk of the whole to a quart. Season this 



BOILED PUDDINGS. 113 

mixture with sugar, grated nutmeg, and a little ground 
ginger, and boil it for an hour in a buttered basin or 
mould, covered on the top by a sheet of buttered paper, 
and tied up in a cloth. Currants may be added to 
this if liked. Serve with any sweet sauce. This pud- 
ding may also be baked in the dish in which it is to be 
served, in which case the top should be covered with 
thin slices of bread well buttered. It will not require 
so long baking as boiling. See p. 117. 

Ground Rice Pudding is made of nearly the same 
materials as the above. The ground rice should be 
boiled in the milk, along with some lemon-peel, which 
having imparted its flavour by the time the milk has 
become thickened, is then removed, and the other in- 
gredients except the bread-crumbs are added. A larger 
proportion of eggs may be used, and the flavour varied 
by a few pounded bitter almonds. The basin or mould 
should be quite filled with it, as it does not swell much 
in boiling. Serve with a sweet sauce or marmalade. 
This may also be baked like the preceding, but without 
a covering of bread and butter. 

Potato Pudding. Mash a pound of boiled potatoes, 
along with half a pound of fresh butter melted, and 
two ounces of sweet almonds scalded to remove the 
skins, and pounded. Mix with this five or six eggs 
beaten up with a little milk, and season it with sugar 
and nutmeg. It may be boiled in a cloth, either with 
or without a buttered mould. Serve with sweet sauce. 

An excellent plain potato pudding, to be eaten along 
with roast meat, may be made with equal quantities of 
mashed potatoes and flour, mixed with a smaller pro- 
portion of minced suet, and seasoned with a little salt. 
This is boiled in a cloth. If intended to be browned 
below the roast, it consists merely of boiled potatoes 
mashed with a little milk and butter, and seasoned 
with white pepper and salt, and if liked, a small quan- 
tity of finely minced onion. 

Pease Pudding to accompany boiled bacon, &c. Tie 
up some dry split peas in a cloth, leaving them room 

I 



114 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

to swell, and boil them for half an hour, or till softened, 
when they ought to fill the cloth tightly. Then 
mash, and rub them through a sieve ; add some butter, 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt, mix these well 
with the pudding, and tie it up in a floured cloth, as 
closely as possible upon the peas, because they will 
swell no more. Boil the pudding for an hour. One or 
tw^o eggs may be mixed with it, especially if the peas 
are at all watery after their first boiling ; it will thus 
be made firmer. Mashed potatoes make an economical 
ingredient in peas pudding. 

Oatmeal Pudding consists of a mixture of minced 
suet and onion with oatmeal, seasoned with pepper and 
salt, bound together with beat eggs, and boiled in a cloth 
tied loosely. It affords an excellent opportunity for 
using up meat which has been used in making gravy, 
soups, &c. ; all that is required being simply to mince 
this finely and mix it with the other ingredients. It is 
a very good accompaniment to roast meat. 

Scotch White Puddings are merely the above mixture 
minus the eggs, stuffed into well cleaned skins like 
sausages. Liver Puddings are the same, with the 
addition of boiled and grated ox-liver in the proportion 
of a fourth. Black Puddings contain, besides the oat- 
meal, &c., some freshly-drawn bullock's blood, salted, 
strained, and mixed with a little milk or broth. These 
puddings in skins are boiled (being pricked during that 
process to let out the air which expanding with the heat 
might burst them), after which they will keep good for 
a considerable time. When to be used, they are re- 
warm.ed by broiling. 

Scotch Haggis. This dish is a great favourite with 
unsophisticated Scotchmen, and is thus lovingly lauded 
by their own poet Burns : — 

Fair fa' your honest sonsy face, 

Great chieftain o' the puddin' race ! 

Aboon them a' ye tak' your place — 
Painch, tripe, or thairm : 

Ye are weel worthy o' a grace 
As lang 's my airm. 



BOILED PUDDINGS. 115 

It is made thus : — Procure the stomach-bag and pluck 
of a sheep, this latter consisting of the heart, lights, 
and liver. Wash the bag well in cold water, and then 
plunge it into boiling water, after which it must be 
scraped very clean, taking care not to cut it. It is then 
laid in salt and water for a night. Wash also the pluck, 
and parboil it. Grate half the liver and mince the rest 
of the pluck (rejecting any gristly or tough parts), and 
mix these with half their weight of finely chopped beef- 
suet, about a dozen small onions also minced, and two 
teacupfuls of oatmeal which has been well dried and 
toasted before the fire. Season the mixture rather 
highly with pepper, salt, and a little cayenne, moisten 
it with some of the liquor in which the pluck was boiled 
and a little lemon-juice, and put it into the bag. This 
should not be much above half filled, else it may be 
burst by the expansion of its contents. Press out the 
air, sew up the orifice with a needle and thread, and 
put the haggis on the fire in a large pot of boiling 
water, with a plate in the bottom to prevent it from 
burning. Let it boil, but not violently, for three hours, 
pricking the bag with a large needle to let out the air 
if it appears very tightly distended. — An emasculated 
variety of this dish, which may be characterized per- 
haps as English Haggis, is in Scotland called 

Lamb's Haggis. In this, besides the pluck, the lamb's 
fry is also used. This is composed of the small bowels, 
sweetbreads, and kernels. The small bowels must be 
slit up with scissors, and the whole pluck and fry 
thoroughly washed and cleaned, and then parboiled. 
They are now minced along with the kidney-fat in place 
of suet, and some young onions ; and seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Instead of oatmeal, a thin 
batter, made with a couple of eggs beat up with half a 
pint of milk and sufficient flour, may be mixed with 
the minced meat. It is boiled in the lamb's stomach- 
bag, prepared in the same way as described in the last 
receipt. 

Fruit Puddings. — These are made with any kind of 



116 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

fresh or unripe fruit ; such as apples, pared, cored and 
sliced ; or young green gooseberries, red currants, rasps, 
cherries, &c., picked free from stalks and leaves. Make 
a paste as in the receipt for suet dumpling, p. 110, 
(adding a very small quantity of carbonate of soda, 
which should be dissolved in the water), but roll it into 
a circular shape, and keep it considerably thicker in 
the middle. One or two beaten eggs mixed with this 
paste makes it much lighter. Lay a floured cloth in a 
deep basin as directed on p. 108, and inside this lay the 
paste, pressing it lightly so as to make it lie close to 
the interior of the basin, which should be of such di- 
mensions as to allow the edges of the paste to project a 
little over the lip. Place the fruit inside the paste, 
along with a sufficient quantity of sugar to sweeten it, 
heaping it up in the middle. Wet the edges of the 
paste, gather them together over the top, mould and 
press them till they adhere, and make the joining se- 
cure by laying over it a small circle of paste rolled thin. 
Then tie the cloth quite closely over the pudding, as 
the fruit shrinks rather than swells. A Rhubarb pud- 
ding may be made in the same way; — the rhubarb 
being peeled, and cut into half inch lengths. When 
apples are cooked thus, a seasoning of cinnamon or 
cloves is an improvement. These puddings may also 
be boiled in a mould or basin ; — this being buttered 
inside, the pudding is constructed in it as above direct- 
ed, a piece of buttered paper laid on the top, and the 
cloth tied tightly over the whole. Thus prepared, such 
puddings are less apt to break when being dished, be- 
cause, instead of being round, they take the form of 
the basin or mould, and consequently have a larger 
basis to rest upon when turned out. 

Apple Dumplings consist of one apple each, inclosed 
in a paste such as the above. The apple is pared, but 
not sliced ; the core is removed by means of a tubular 
cutter made for the purpose, and the interior filled 
with a mixture of sugar and ground cinnamon. It is 
then surrounded with paste moulded on to it with the 



BAKED PUDDINGS. 117 

hands, and each dumpling is boiled in a separate cloth. 
These being smaller than puddings, need not be boiled 
quite so long. Apple dumplings made with boiled rice 
instead of paste, are called American Snow-halls. 

Meat Puddings. These are mostly made and boiled 
in the same way as fruit puddings, substituting small 
slices of meat, with appropriate seasonings for the fruit 
and sugar. Two pounds of meat will be enough, for 
which two hours and a quarter's cooking will be suffi- 
cient if the meat be full grown ; young meats require 
longer, and pork longest of all. Beef-steak Pudding is 
seasoned by dipping the slices of meat in a mixture of 
pepper, salt, and flour ; and before closing the paste, a 
very little water is poured in. The addition of a few 
oysters is considered an improvement. 

Mutton, Lamh, Veal, Pork, Rahhits, Kidneys, Salmon, 
Cod, d'c, may all be made into very nice puddings 
much in the same way ; — the condiments, seasonings, 
time required in cooking, &c., being varied to suit the 
different viands used in their concoction, a competent 
knowledge of all which it is presumed tlie attentive 
student may have gathered from the previous chapters 
on roastinof and broiling:. 



BAKED PUDDINGS.— These are baked either in 
the dish in which they are to appear at table, or in a 
buttered mould from which they are turned out when 
done. Of the former kind are the Rice puddings, de- 
scribed on pages 112-113 ; and the Plum Pudding de- 
scribed on page 111 is one of the latter. As a general 
rule, such puddings may be baked in half the time re- 
quired to boil them j — this, however, of course depends 
greatly on the heat of the oven. Besides the above- 
specified puddings, there is an immense number of 
others, in nearly all of which eggs constitute the ingre- 
dient on which their firmness and lightness depend. 
The coagulation of the eggs takes place at nearly the 
same temperature as is required to soHdify the albumen 
of meat (140°), and a greater heat, especially if long 



118 BAKED PUDDINGS. 

continued, impairs the lightness of the pudding. To 
cook most of the other ingredients, however, especially 
dry farinaceous substances, such as rice, sago, &c., they 
must be subjected for a considerable time to a much 
higher temperature ; hence it is generally necessary to 
boil these till softened, before adding the eggs. All 
baked puddings should be delicately browned on the 
top. The most simple is perhaps the 

Custard Pudding. It consists merely of new milk 
and eggs. The milk, seasoned with sugar, cinnamon, and 
lemon-peel, is heated in a small saucepan over the fire 
until it begins to boil, when it is poured over the eggs 
well beaten in a basin, and rapidly stirred till mixed. 
This mixture, which is called a custard, is then baked 
in the dish in which it is to be served, with a little nut- 
meg grated over the top. The number of eggs required 
is from four to six, according to size, to each pint of 
milk. One or two of the Qgg9, may be omitted, and 
its place supplied by a little flour, which should be 
thoroughly mixed with the milk before boiling it. 
This delicate pudding requires very little baking : — 
browning it in a dispatch before the fire will be sufii- 
cient. It is eaten either by itself or with jelly or mar- 
malade. Any kind of preserved fruit may be placed in 
it before baking. 

Bread Pudding. Boil milk, seasoned as above, and 
pour it over the crumb of stale bread broken in small 
pieces in a basin. Cover the basin for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and then mash the bread into a fine pulp, 
stirring in a small piece of butter. Three or four well- 
beaten eggs are then added, and if desired, a little 
brandy and a few currants ; and when the whole is well 
mixed, bake it in the pudding dish in the oven for half 
an hour. Another bread pudding, or Bread -and-Butter 
Pudding, is made by filling the baking dish with layers 
of thin slices of bread and butter without crust, and 
then pouring in a seasoned mixture of beat eggs and 
cold milk, till it reaches the level of the top layer. This 
should stand for three or four hours before going to the 



BAKED PUDDINGS. 119 

oven, in order that the bread may soak and swell. Cur- 
rants, stoned raisins, sliced apples with sugar, or any 
kind of preserved fruity may be strewed between the 
layers of bread and butter. 

Tapioca, Sago, and Vermicelli Puddings. Simmer 
till quite soft, six tablespoonfuls of either of these ar- 
ticles in a quart of milk, stirring it almost constantly , 
to prevent its burning. Then pour it into a basin, and 
stir in a little butter and three well-beaten eggs. Bake 
in a buttered pudding-dish for half an hour ; or boil it 
for an hour and a half, in a mould or basin immersed 
to half its depth in a pot of boiling water ; — but the 
browned surface produced by baking looks much nicer. 
If boiled, an additional Qgg may be put in. 

Macaroni Pudding is made precisely like the pre- 
ceding. The following mode of dressing macaroni is, 
however, by many preferred to this. It is first sim- - 
mered in milk, or veal-stock, and butter till quite tender, 
and then placed in the dish in which it is to be served, 
in layers alternately with grated Dutch cheese. The 
top is covered with cheese, a layer of bread-crumbs is 
sprinkled over this, and a number of small pieces of 
butter placed here and there over the whole. It is 
then baked in a dispatch till delicately browned. Beat 
eggs, and minced fowl and ham, with a seasoning of 
pepper and salt, may be sdded to the above, when it 
may be cooked in a mould partly immersed in boiling 
water, turned out upon a dish, and served with a rich 
meat gravy poured over it. 

Yorkshire or Batter Pudding, (to accompany roast 
meat). Mix together, very smoothly, a quart of new 
milk and as much flour as will make a thickish batter, 
Add a little salt and four well-beaten eggs, and mix 
these perfectly with the batter. Pour it into the 
bottom of a broad earthen pan, or tin dish, well but- 
tered, and bake it under a roast of meat, either in the 
oven (see p. 25) or before the fire. The pudding is 
enriched by the gravy and dripping from the meat, 
and when cooked, ought to be about an inch thick. 



120 BAKED PUDDINGS. 

If done before the fire, the under side requires to be 
browned either by turning it uppermost in the dish 
after the upper side is done, or by placing the dish over 
the fire for a short time. It is served either whole or 
cut in slices in a hot dish. For a boiled batter pudding 
the mixture of milk and flour should be stirred along 
with a little butter in a saucepan over the fire till it 
becomes thickened, and then allowing it to cool before 
adding the beaten eggs. Ground rice, arrow-root, or 
potato flour, may be substituted for the wheaten flour. 
It is boiled in a buttered basin and cloth, and may be 
served either plain as an accompaniment to roast meat, 
or with sweet sauce. If it is to be eaten with sweet 
sauce, the addition of apples cut in small pieces, or 
orange marmalade, is a great improvement. 

Nottinyham Pudding consists of a batter like the 
above, with a number of apples prepared as for apple 
dumplings (see p. 116) imbedded in it. « 

Toad in a Hole. — This oddly-named pudding con- 
sists of a Yorkshire pudding made with the addition 
of a little more flour than the above, and some finely- 
chopped beef-suet. In the centre of this is placed a 
solid piece of juicy lean beef, which may be supposed 
to stand for the " Toad." The remains of any kind of 
cooked meat or poultry, properly seasoned, may be re- 
warmed in such a pudding in place of the beef, as it 
does not require much baking. 

Apple Pudding consists of a mixture of stewed ap- 
ples passed through a sieve, beat eggs, and butter, — 
seasoned with grated lemon-peel, cinnamon, cloves, and 
sugar to taste, and a little lemon juice if the apples are 
not tart enough. Some bread crumbs or pounded bis- 
cuit may be added if the apples are very juicy. It 
may be baked in a dish lined with pufl" paste — (see 
p. 128.) Similar Puddings may be made with Rhubarb, 
Green Gooseberries, or any other fruit either fresh or 
preserved. 

A Charlotte or French Fruit Pudding is made by 
lining; a mould with thin slices of bread buttered on 



BAKED PUDDINGS. 121 

both sides, filling the interior compactly with sliced 
apples or other fruit (not too juicy) properly sweetened 
and spiced, and covering the top with a single buttered 
slice cut to fit the mouth of the mould. It is then 
baked in a slow oven till the bread becomes browned ; 
— a plate or flat cover, rather smaller than the interior 
of the mould, but corresponding in shape, may be 
placed on the top with a weight resting upon it while 
baking. When done, it is turned out upon a dish and 
served hot. Melted red-currant or other jelly may be 
poured round it in the dish as a sauce. A Malvern 
Pudding is made as above, but with the bread not but- 
tered, and the apples or other fruit stewed and put in 
hot. It is not baked, but merely allowed to stand with 
the weight on the top till cold and congealed, when it 
is ready for use. Prunes (stoned) Sind Jigs may be era- 
ployed in this way. 

Besides those above described, there are a great many 
sweet fancy puddings, which, being generally more orna- 
mental than useful, lie rather beyond the scope of this 
work. For this reason, and also because of our neces- 
sarily limited space we shall restrict ourselves to a few 
hints regarding the essential processes in their prepara- 
tion, — sufficient, we hope, to enable the intelligent 
housewife to make many an excellent pudding of her 
own invention, and at least to avoid such blunders as 
that committed by a certain English ambassador's French 
cook, who dismayed his master by setting before his 
Parisian guests (who had been promised a great treat) 
a Plum Pudding in the form of an immense tureenful 
of pasty plum-porridge ; apologizing at the same time 
for his inability to procure a vessel large enough to 
contain the whole. It turned out that, in giving his 
rec^pt, the ambassador, in his over-anxiety about the 
exact quantity of water iu'which the pudding was to be 
boiled, had forgotten to mention the pudding -cloth. 

\st. The firmness of all light puddings, as already 
mentioned, depends upon the eggs they contain. This 
arises from the property of eggs, more particularly of 



122 ' BAKED PUDDINGS. 

the whites, of coagulating at a temperature of about 
140% and of at the same time binding together all solid 
particles with which they are in contact ; — a property 
which to a certain extent they impart to any fluid in 
which they may be dissolved. If the proportion of fluid 
be very large, and a greater heat be applied for a con- 
siderable time, the white of egg separates as a floculent 
sediment; as is well exemplified in the clarifying of 
stock — (see p. 85.) In puddings, however, this separa- 
tion of the eggs from the fluid with which they are 
mixed must be prevented by using them in a much 
larger proportion, and taking care not to expose the 
mixture to too high a temperature. Hence cooking in 
a mould placed in boiling water is better than baking 
for many of the lighter puddings, as a more gentle heat 
may thus be applied. The top may be browned after- 
wards before a brisk fire if desired. 

2d. The lightness of most fancy puddings is pro- 
duced by whisking the whites of the eggs into a stiff" 
froth before mixing them with the other ingredients. 
This is done by rapidly beating them in a basin with a 
couple of forks tied together, or what is better, with a 
bundle of small twigs called a whisk. The inumerable 
little bells of air inclosed in this froth, and thus intro- 
duced into the pudding, cause it to swell or " rise" by their 
expansion when baked, thus producing a lightness simi- 
lar to that of bread. But, unlike the lightness of bread, 
which is mainly caused by the generation of a gas within 
the substance of the dough, that of puddings, so far as 
it arises from this cause, lasts no longer than while the 
pudding remains hot, because, as it cools, the inclosed 
air shrinks again to its former bulk, and the pudding 
of course " falls" to such extent as its firmness will per- 
mit. Hence such puddings are much impaired if al- 
lowed to stand long after being ready. Even if kept hot, 
there is a danger of the solid parts of the pudding se- 
parating from the fluid, Hke curds from whey. 

3d. the butte?- also should be beaten with a knife or 
spatula until it forms a sort of cream. This seems to 



BAKED PUDDINGS. 123 

contribute to their lightness partly in the same way as 
whisking the white of eggs, — namely, by inclosing in 
the butter a considerable quantity of air, and partly by 
making it more easily mixed with the other ingredients. 

Uh. Baked puddings should be cooked in a moderate 
oven ; for if too quickly heated their surface becomes 
bound and hardened before it begins to rise ; if too 
slowly, the inclosed air expands and escapes before the 
pudding is sufficiently firmed to prevent it. 

We give the following receipt as an example of the 
mode of treatment and ordet of mixing of the different 
ingredients : — 

Prince A Ibert's Pudding. — With half a pound of 
fresh butter beaten to a cream, mix by degrees an equal 
weight of loaf-sugar, pounded, dried, and sifted. After 
these have been well mixed, and beaten together, add 
first the yolks, and then the whites of five eggs, the 
latter whisked separately into a strong froth. Then 
strew in lightly half a pound of the finest well-dried 
flour, adding it gradually, so as to mix completely without 
forming knots. Last of all, put in half a pound of 
stoned raisins and a little grated lemon-peel. When 
thoroughly mixed, the pudding is poured into a well- 
buttered mould, which is immediately placed in a sauce- 
pan half fall of boihng water, and boiled under a close 
cover for three hours. Such puddings may be orna- 
mented by lining the mould, previous to pouring in 
the mixture, with strips of candied orange-peel or citron 
arranged so as to form some fanciful pattern. 

A very light kind of pudding, called on that account 
a Souffl,e, owes its excellence almost entirely to the 
proper whisking of the eggs used in it. It is made by 
preparing a quart of melted butter (see p. 102) with 
milk which has been previously flavoured by boiling in 
it candied orange-flowers, vanilla, lemon-peel, or any si- 
milar flavouring substance, adding the yolks of ten eggs 
and sugar to this while boiling, and when cold, lightly 
stirring in the whites of the eggs whisked to a perfect 
froth. The Soufile is then immediately poured into an 



124 OMELETS. 

appropriate dish or a prepared paste-mould or shell, 
carefully baked, and served hot. A Fondue is a pud- 
ding similar to the above, except that the flavouring 
ingredient is grated cheese, and the seasoning salt, 
pepper, and a little cayenne, which are added along 
with the yolks of the eggs. The addition of boiled 
macaroni to this converts it into a Neapolitan Fondue. 



Omelets. The essential ingredient of these is eggs, 
— yolks and whites beaten together, but not to a froth. 
With this may be mixed- almost any flavouring sub- 
stance, either animal or vegetable, which the taste of 
the cook may dictate ; such as boiled and minced ham 
or tongue, kidneys, shrimps, oysters, cheese, onions, 
parsley, thyme, sage, mushrooms, lemon-peel, &c. A 
judicious selection of such materials, minced or grated, 
mixed with a little butter and flour and appropriate 
seasonings, is stirred among the beaten eggs, but not 
in such quantity as to deprive the compound of its 
fluidity. The omelet is then sauteed in a small pan 
containing a suflicient quantity of butter to prevent it 
from sticking to the bottom. When first placed over 
the fire, it should be rapidly stirred until the eggs 
begin to set. It should then be drawn together to the 
centre of the pan, so as to form a rather thick cake, 
and when this is browned on the under side, and com- 
pletely firmed, the process is finished. If the upper 
side is required to be browned, this may be done in 
front of the fire, or by means of a salamander or a hot 
shovel held over it ; or by turning the omelet, which 
may be accomplished by laying a plate above it, revers- 
ing it into the plate, and then carefully slipping it 
back into the pan. The chief considerations to be at- 
tended to in cooking an omelet are, to make it thick 
and to avoid over-cooking it ; otherwise it will be 
tough, leathery, and indigestible. It must be noted 
also, that as the eggs composing it require very little 
cooking, the other ingredients ought to have been pre- 
viously cooked, in those cases where otherwise they 



OMELETS. 125 

might be prejudicial. The omelet is served upon a hot 
dish, with a rich meat gravy or savoury sauce poured 
over it. Sweet Omelets are made by flavouring the 
eggs simply with sugar, — a few drops of essence of 
lemon, cinnamon, cloves, or carraway, being added if 
desired. Upon such an omelet any preserved fruits, — 
gooseberry, raspberry, or strawberry jam, &c., may be 
spread before sending to table. 

A Pancake is generally a more simple preparation 
than an omelet. In this case the eggs, beaten up with 
a little nutmeg and salt, are mixed merely with flour 
and milk. The flour is mixed in the first, with some 
of the milk, in the proportion of about four ounces of 
flour to every three eggs, and more milk is then added 
till the batter is reduced to the consistence of thick 
cream. It is then sauteed in the same manner as des- 
cribed above for omelets, except that it must not be 
stirred, — a sufficient quantity being poured into the 
pan at one time to make the pancake about one-eighth 
of an inch thick. It should be frequently shaken to 
prevent its adhering to the pan. When browned on 
one side, it is turned, either by lifting it with a broad 
slice similar to that used for fish, or by skilfully tossing 
it up so as to make it turn in the air and catching it 
in the pan as it falls. When browned on the other 
side, it is sprinkled with sugar, folded, laid in a hot 
dish and kept warm while the same process is repeated 
till all the batter is used. As very little butter is re- 
quired, a fresh piece should be put into the pan for 
each pancake. They should be served hot and eaten 
immediately, as they cannot be kept any length of time 
after they are cooked without becoming heavy and in- 
digestible. The above is the usual mode of serving 
pancakes, but they may also have any sort of fruit- 
preserve spread between the folds instead of sugar. 
They are also very good plain, with the sauce described 
on p. 107, under Sharp Sauce. 

A very economical batter for pancakes may be made 
by substituting brisk small beer for the eggs and milk. 



126 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

This batter must not stand long before using it, else 
the pancakes made of it will be heavy. If sauteed 
and eaten immediately, however, they will be found 
scarcely inferior to those made with eggs. 

Apple Fritters consists of thin slices of apple, peeled 
and cored, dipped in a pancake batter having a little 
more flour in it than the above, and fried separately in 
enough of hot lard to cover them. When lightly 
browned, they are drained, and served hot with pow- 
dered loaf-sugar strewed over them. Similar fritters 
may be made with preserved pears, plums, &c. Oysters 
are also used for fritters in the same manner. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR PASTRY. 

Under this head are included all Pies and Tarts, and 
every variety of Bread, Cakes, Biscuits, &c. 

Of Pies and Tarts there are two kinds, namely those 
which are baked in a pie-dish, and covered with paste, 
and those distinguished by the name of Raised Pies, 
which have a complete casing or crust of paste, In 
both kinds the effect upon meat is very much the same, 
being somewhat similar to that produced by braising. 
As the heat of the oven, however, is generally greater 
than that employed in braising, it is all the more 
necessary that the meat for pies should be kept till in 
proper cooking condition. 

The Paste for Raised Pies requires to be firmer and 
more compact than that used for merely covered ones. 
It consists of wheaten flour made into a stiff dough with 
lard or dripping and water made boiling hot. This 
must be well kneaded and rolled upon a floured paste 
board into a sheet of a thickness proportioned to the 
size of the pie to be made from it. The under case of 
the pie is formed either by lining an opening pie-mould 
with this sheet, or by cutting from it properly shaped 
side and bottom pieces, and cementing these together 
with white of egg ; the lid or top is cut out and cemen- 
ted on in the same way after the pie is filled. In large 



FOR PASTRY. 127 

pies this is generally covered by a layer of ornamented 
puff paste. If a mould has been used, it is removed 
when the pie is cooked. Large raised pies are now 
much less in vogue than they used to be, being much 
more difficult to make well, and less convenient than 
covered pies. The above paste, however, answers for 
the cases of small mutton pies and fruit tarts. 

Paste for covering Meat Pies. Rub three ounces of 
butter into one pound of flour, adding a little salt if 
the butter is fresh. When these are thoroughly incor- 
porated, add as much cold water as will make them 
into a thick dough. Knead this quickly (but not too 
much) upon the paste board, which should be strewed 
with dry flour to prevent the paste from sticking to it. 
Roll it out to about three quarters of an inch in thick- 
ness, invert the pie-dish upon it, and cut away the pro- 
jecting margin of paste, which will thus leave a piece 
of the exact size required. When the dish is filled with 
the meat, which should be so arranged as to be highest 
in the centre, its edges are wetted, and covered with 
thin strips of paste rolled out of the trimmings of the 
cover ; these again are wetted, and the cover laid on 
and pressed close down at the edges. The edges of 
the cover are now neatly pared and ornamentally scol- 
loped or notched ; — a few leaves or other fancy orna- 
ments are moulded from the superfluous scraps of paste, 
and laid tastefully on the top j a small hole is made in 
the centre of the cover to permit the escape of the 
steam, and the pie is ready for the oven, — the heat of 
which, for all such pies, should be moderate. 

Pvff Paste is lighter than either of the above. It is 
used chiefly for fruit pies and tarts. When baked, it 
ought to consist of a mass of thin, crisp, and slightly 
coherent laminse or scales. This structure is produced 
by introducing butter into a flour-and-water paste by 
the following process : — Weigh equal quantities of flour 
and fresh butter ; knead the butter under water till 
freed from all traces of butter-milk ; mix the flour with 
the yolk of an eg^, the juice of a lemon, a pinch of salt, 



128 PUFF PASTE. 

and as miicli cold water as will make it into a smooth 
paste of the same consistence as the butter. This paste 
must not be too much kneaded, else it will become 
tough by the coherence of the gluten of the flour. Strew 
the paste board with flour, and roll out the paste upon 
it to about half an inch in thickness, andaftsr moulding 
the butter with the hands into the form of a flat cake, 
place this in the centre of the sheet of paste and fold 
the sides over it. Again roll out the paste with the in- 
closed butter into an oblong thin sheet ; fold this into 
three, roll it out again so that what were before the 
sides of the sheet may now become the ends, and re- 
peat this folding and rolling seven or eight times. The 
butter will thus become equally diff'used through the 
mass in thin layers alternating with the paste. Great 
care must be taken, during this operation, to keep the 
paste board, the rolhng pin, and the hands, well dusted 
with dry flour, in order to prevent the surface of the paste 
from adhering to any of these and tearing off, which it 
is very apt to do towards the end of the process, when 
the layers become very thin. Purticular attention 
should likewise be paid to have the water-paste and 
the butter as nearly as possible of the same consistence, 
else by yielding unequally to the action of the rolling- 
pin, the layers will neither be of a uniform thickness, 
nor so regularly alternated as they ought to be. The 
lightness of this kind of paste arises from the steam 
generated while baking, raising up or blistering the 
layers of paste, which at the same time absorb the in- 
tervening layers of butter as these melt. Hence puff- 
paste requires a rather hot oven, in order that this 
blistering, which of course takes place progressively 
from the surface inwards, may commence before the 
thin surface layers become sufficiently dried and har- 
dened to prevent it. The mode of covering a fruit pie 
with this paste is that already described for meat pies ; 
the decoration of the cover being of course made appro- 
priate to the contents. An intermediate, or sort of 
Half Puff Paste, may be made by rubbing about a 



MEAT PIES. 129 

quarter of the butter among the dry flour as in the 
previous receipt, and proceeding with the rest as al- 
ready directed. This is better adapted for those kinds 
of fruit which require a longer time in a slower oven. 
Puff-pa§te, while being made, should be bept as cold as 
possible, and it is even advisable in warm weather to 
use iced water, and also, about the middle of the pro- 
cess, to lay it for half an hour upon a tray or baking 
sheet set upon ice. 

When taken from the oven, meat pies may be glazed 
on the top by brushing them over, while quite hot, 
with white of egg thinned with a little water ; and 
fruit pies with sugar and M'-ater applied in the same 
way. The latter are " iced," by brushing them with 
white of eggs whisked to a froth, sprinkling over this 
a layer of finely-pounded loaf-sugar, and then returning 
them to oven for ten minutes. 



MEAT PIES.— The most frequent fault of these is 
being over-cooked. This must be avoided by attending 
to the heat of the oven, and proportioning the duration 
of the baking to the size of the pie. In an iron oven, 
a brick or two upon which to place the pies protects 
them from the extreme heat of the metal bottom, so 
that they are more equally and gently cooked. For 
pies intended to be eaten cold, veal and such young 
meat is best adapted, the gravy of which forms a strong 
jelly when cold. Forcemeat, or sausage-meat, frequent- 
ly forms an ingredient in such pies, either in the form 
of balls, or as a lining to the dish and a cover to the 
meat, under the paste. 

Beefsteak Fie. Tender rump steaks are clipped in 
a seasoning of pepper and salt mixed with flour, and 
either laid flat in the dish, or rolled up as olives. When 
the dish is properly filled, pour in a little water or 
gravy, cover with paste as previously directed (p. 127), 
and bake it for about an hour. 

Veal Pie may be made of chops from the back-ribs 
or loin. The bones should be removed, and a little 

K 



130 MEAT AND OTHER PIES. 

gravy prepared from them. Lay the chops flat in the 
dish in layers, strewing over each a seasoning of pepper, 
salt, flour, and finely-minced parsley. When filled, 
pour into the dish tho gravy made from the bones, put 
on the cover, and bake the pie rather longer than an 
hour. A layer or two of ham is a great improvement 
in this pie. Cakes of well-seasoned sausage-meat may 
also be introduced. If intended to be eaten cold during 
warm weather, a little isinglass may be dissolved in the 
gravy to ensure its congealing. 

Mutton or Lamh Pie is made precisely in the same 
way, but omitting the ham. Sliced onions and pota- 
toes may be interspersed among the meat, and curry 
powder may be used in the seasoning. Lamb, however, 
should not be so highly seasoned as mutton. For small 
round raised mutton-pies, the meat is cut into small 
dice. Such pies may be re-warmed in the Dutch oven. 

Pork Pie. For this, small slices from the loin are best. 
They are seasoned with pepper and salt. A little mus- 
tard may be mixed with the gravy before pouring it in. 

Venison Pasty. Cut a breast of venison into small 
pieces, trimming away all bone, skin, &c. Season these 
with pepper, salt, mace, and allspice. Lay them in the 
dish ; and, if very lean, a few thin slices from the firm 
fat of a neck of mutton may be placed among them. 
Pour over them a gravy drawn from the trimmings ; 
cover with a rather thick crust neatly ornamented, and 
bake in a very moderiite oven for an hour and a half. 

Babbit Pie. Cut a nicely-cleaned rabbit into joints, 
and pile these in the pie-dish with half a pound of 
streaky bacon in inch-square pieces, and a seasoning of 
chopped onion and parsley, pepper and salt. Pour in 
a little water, cover, and bake for an hour. 

Pigeon Pie. Having well picked and cleaned the 
pigeons, cut off the heads and feet, turn the wings 
upon the back, and draw the legs inside under the 
skin. Put a piece of butter rolled in pepper and salt 
inside each bird. Place a layer of beef-steaks or veal 
in the bottom of the dish, and upon this lay the pigeons, 



MEAT AND OTHER PIES. 131 

breasts upwards, and fill up the vacancies with the 
livers and gizzards well seasoned. Pour in a little 
gravy or water, cover with paste, and bake for an hour. 
Some joiks of hard-boiled eggs may be added to this 
pie, and the feet of the pigeons are sometimes stuck 
into the crust as an ornament. A thin slice of ham 
laid on the breast of each bird improves the flavour. 
A Partridge Pie is made in the same Avay. 

Chicken Pie. For this a good plump chicken should 
be carved into joints, dusted with flour, and seasoned 
with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. These joints 
are laid in a small pie-dish, somewhat in their natural 
order, but with a layer of sliced ham or bacon placed 
below the back, another between the back and breast, 
and several layers over the breast, which should be cut 
in half Pour in a little water or veal broth, and 
bake fully longer than an hour. An excellent Raised 
Pie, to be eaten cold, may be made with a fowl having 
the bones cut out as follows : — Make an incision down 
the back, detach the sides, wings, and thigh bones, cut- 
ting off the legs and pinions below the first joint, and 
lastly separate the flesh from the breast bone — all 
which must be done so as to keep the skin and flesh as 
whole as possible. This is then filled with alternate 
layers of ham, veal, and forcemeat, and enclosed within 
a raised crust lined with forcemeat in a mould. This 
pie should be allowed to become quite cold before 
removing it from the mould, when it may be carved in 
firm slices cut across the Avhole way through. 

Gihlet Pie. Stew some well cleaned goose giblets 
(see p. 70) in broth, along with peppercorns, onions, 
and parsley. When the stew is cold, it is placed in the 
pie-dish with a beef-steak underneath, the gravy strained 
over it, and a few sliced boiled potatoes laid on the top. 
The crust may be made of half puff-paste (p. 128-9). 
Bake it rather less than an hour. 

Eel Pie. After being skinned and cleaned, the eels 
are cut into two-inch lengths, and then simmered for 
a short time in broth, along with a bouquet of parsley 



132 FISH PIES, &C. 

and thyme, and some onion and cloves. Drain the sauce 
from them, and mix with it about half as much brown 
sauce. Boil this mixture till reduced to a half, and 
strain it over the eels in the pie-dish. When cold, 
cover it, and bake for about an hour. 

Fish Pies may be made of salmon or almost any other 
good-sized fish. The fish should first be boiled in the 
usual way (see p. 47), then skinned and boned, and 
placed in layers in the pie-dish, each layer being 
sprinkled with a seasoning of pepper, allspice, mace, 
and salt if necessary. A little of the fish-liquor, en- 
riched by boiling in it the bones and skins, is strained 
over it when the dish is full. The pie is then covered 
with a light paste, and baked rather more than an hour. 
The addition of a few shrimps, prawns, or oysters, im- 
proves the flavour of such pies. 

Oyster Patties. The cases for these are made by lin- 
ing little moulds, called pattypans, with thin sheets of 
puff-paste, placing in the inside a little ball of paper to 
support the cover, which is then cut out of a similar 
sheet of puff-paste and fastened on in the usual way. 
When baked about a quarter of an hour, the covers are 
taken off, and the paper ball removed, and replaced by 
some oyster sauce — (see p. 103.) This should be made 
rather thick, the oysters being cut into small pieces ; 
and when made quite hot, the patties are filled with it, 
and, the covers being replaced, served immediately. 
Similar patties may be made with almost any kind of 
cold cooked meat or fowls, minced and re-warmed in a 
thick hislilv-seasoned sauce. 



Mince Pie. — The material of this is a sort of sweet 
forcemeat, or seasoned mixture of fruit and meat. It 
consists of the following ingredients in equal propor- 
tions by weight : — Beef-suet, lean of roast-beef, apples 
pared and cored, stoned raisins, and well-cleaned cur- 
rants. Each of these, except the currants, requires to 
be finely minced separately, and then the whole are 
intimately mixed, along with half a proportion of raw 



FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 133 

sugar, a sixteenth part eaeh of orange and lemon-peel 
minced and of ground cinnamon, half that quantity 
of ground ginger, a little salt, grated nutmeg, brandy 
and sherry. This mixture will keep good for a long 
time if tightly packed in a closely-covered jar. The 
pie is made by lining the bottom of a shallow dish with 
<\ thin sheet of puff-paste, filling it (but not too full) 
with the above mixture, and then covering it v/ith 
another sheet of puff-paste. Bake in a quick oven for 
half an hour, or till the paste is properly risen and 
browned. They may be made of any size, from that of 
the smallest patty to that of a large dish. The smaller 
ones of course require less baking. 



FRUIT PIES and TA^TS.— Fruit Pies are covered 
in the same way as meat pies, puff-paste (see p. 127)' 
being used for perfectly ripe juicy fruit such as rasps 
and currants, and half puff-paste (p. 128-9) for unripe 
fruit, which requires longer cooking. As all fruit 
shrinks very much when baked, plenty of it should be 
used, piling it high in the centre of the dish ; and in 
order to prevent the cover from sinking too much 
through this shrinking, it is a good plan to support it 
by a teacup placed inverted in the centre of the dish 
before putting in the fruit. The teacup will be found, 
when the pie is baked, to contain most of the juice, 
this having replaced the air expelled by the heat of the 
oven, but on slightly raising one side of it, the juice 
will flow down ready for use. Hard unripe fruits may 
be stewed in ajar placed in boiling water before put- 
ting them into the pie. There will thus be no uncer- 
tainty as to the quantity necessary to fill the dish when 
baked, as it will not shrink any more. The inverted 
teacup, however, should not be dispensed with, because 
the stewed fruit will be much too soft to sustain the 
middle of the cover, which in this case may be made 
of puff-paste as the stewed fruit will not require so 
long baking. Sugar of course is an indispensable ingre- 
dient in these pies, the proportion varying according to 



134 FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 

the acidity of the fruit employed. When a pie is sent 
to a baker's to be covered and baked, it has often been 
found that less sugar will suffice if added in the form 
of a syrup when the pie returns. The syrup is poured 
in at the hole in the cover. 

Under the denomination of Tarts are included all 
small round raised pies of fruit, as well as all uncovered 
tarts, both large and small, consisting of previously- 
stewed and pulped fruit, or jam or marmalade, baked in 
a dish lined with paste, and having an ornamental pufF- 
paste border, or in a puff-paste casing like patties — 
(see p. 1 32). In making the raised crust for the former, 
a little sugar may be introduced. The latter are fre- 
quently decorated on the top with paste ornaments of 
any fanciful design, such as stars, flowers, &c. The 
paste for these ornaments consists of two parts of flour 
and one of pounded loaf-sugar moistened with eggs and 
well kneaded. They are baked separately from the tart 
in a slow oven, taking care not to let them get brown. 

Both pies and tarts are very good cold, in which case 
the stewed or preserved fruit for the latter need not be 
put into the paste until that has been baked. Cream 
or custard are usual accompaniments to pies and tarts 
whether hot or cold, and a basin of pounded loaf-sugar 
should also be placed on the table for those for whom 
the fruit may not have been sufficiently sweetened. 

Ap2:>le Pie. For this, tart juicy apples are the best. 
They must be pared, sliced, and cored, and put into 
the pie-dish in layers, each layer sprinkled with sugar 
and appropriate spices, such as ground cinnamon, 
cloves, ginger, &c. A quince sliced among the apples, 
or a little quince marmalade, greatly improves the fla- 
vour of apple pie. If the sliced apples have to be kept 
any length of time before being used, they ought to be 
thrown into cold water, or covered up closely, else they 
will become discoloured. Cover with the same paste as 
for meat pies (see p. 127), or with half puff-paste (see 
]>. 128-9), and bake for an hour or less according to size. 

Gooseberry Pie. Clip off the heads and stalks of 



FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 135 

unripe gooseberries. Rub the fruit clean in a cloth ; 
pile it high in the dish, along with a considerable 
quantity of brown sugar ; add a very little water, cover 
with half puff-paste (p. 128-9), and bake for upwards of 
an hour. The gooseberries may be previously stewed, 
in which case they may be covered with a rich light 
puiF-paste, and baked for a shorter time. The riper 
they are, the more sugar and longer baking will goose- 
berries require, because then the skiiis become both very 
acid and tough. This remark applies also to most other 
fruit of the same class. 

RJmharh Pie. Use freshly-pulled rhubarb. Cut off 
all the leaf; strip the skin from the stalks, and cut 
them into half-inch lengths. With these the pie is 
made precisely as the proceeding. It is of considerable 
advantage to stew the rhubarb before putting it into 
the pie-dish, because it shrinks so much in cooking 
that it is hardly possible otherwise to get a full pie. 

Red Currants, Raspberries, Cranberries, Clierries, 
Damsons, Plums, d:c., all make excellent pies. They 
must be picked free from stalks and leaves, gently wiped 
clean if necessary, and piled high in the dish, with 
plenty of sugar, especially the more juicy fruits. The 
stone-fruits are best cut open and the stones removed, 
and they may be used rather unripe. The others are 
best when perfectly ripe. Rasps and red currants 
make an excellent mixture. 

Small Covered Tarts, in a raised crust. For these 
the fruit is treated precisely as above directed for pies. 
The crust is shaped in small moulds with sloping or 
perpendicular sides. The best decoration for them is 
a simple notching of the edge and a sugar icing, which 
may be applied before putting them into the oven, as 
these small tarts do not require long baking. 

Open Tarts. For these, the fruit if fresh must be 
previously stewed and sweetened, — apples and green 
gooseberries being also mashed to a pulp. Large tarts 
are made by lining a shallow dish with rich puff-paste, 
placing an additional layer on the edges, which should 



136 TARTS, PUFFS, &C. 

be notched and otherwise ornamented, filling the centre 
with stewed fruit, jam, or marmalade, and baking for 
half an hour. If to be eaten cold, the fruit is better 
not put in until the paste is baked. The top may be 
ornamented with small bars or straws cut from a thin 
sheet of puff-paste, and delicately baked, or with the 
ornaments described on p. 134. For small open tarts, 
the cases are baked in buttered pattypans and filled 
afterwards. If desired hot, they may be warmed before 
the fire or in a slow oven. 

Puffs are made simply by placing a spoonful of pre- 
served or stewed fruit in the centre of a circular piece of 
puff-paste, wetting the edges, folding it half over, and 
slightly pressing the wetted parts to make them ad- 
here. The top may be ornamentally marked, and iced. 
Bake, with a sheet of buttered paper beneath, for half 
an hour or less, according to size. The form of the 
above is of course semicircular, but this may be varied 
by using differently-shaped pieces of paste. 



CAKES, BISCUITS, (fcc— In this department of 
cookery also, there is considerable scope for the exercise 
of invention ; and the ingenious housewife who has ac- 
quired a knowledge of the various materials commonly 
employed, together with some idea of the proportions in 
which they may be mixed, will hardly go wrong if she 
follows the suggestions regarding the proper treatment 
of the eggs and butter already given with reference to 
fancy puddings (see pp. 121-2-3), to which we now 
add the following : — Whisking the eggs in a tin basin 
set in warm water or near the fire, greatly facilitates 
the formation of the froth. The flour and pounded 
sugar ought to be well dried and sifted. Almonds are 
blanched by scalding them, and then rubbing off the 
skins. Candied citron and other peel should be cut in 
long thin strips. 

With regard to the coohing of the cakes, <fec., the 
following may be attended to : — As a general rule, small 
fancy biscuits and cakes require a rather quick oven 



CAKES AND BISCUITS. 137 

until they have risen and become firmlj set ; the heat 
may then be reduced by partly opening the oven door, 
or otherwise. Most large cakes, however, require a 
moderate oven, and to prevent their surface being too 
much dried and browned, a sheet of paper may be laid 
over them. To ascertain if a large cake be sufficiently 
baked, probe it in the centre with a clean knife ; — if 
the blade, when withdrawn, continues dry and clean, 
the cake may be removed from the oven ; if it is 
smeared, the baking must be continued a little longer. 

Any necessary departure from the foregoing direc- 
tions is specially mentioned in the following receipts. 
A knowledge of the mere names of the materials, their 
mechanical properties, and practicable proportions, is of 
course all that can be gathered from any list of receipts ; 
but an intimate acquaintance with their various ^awwri- 
is also essential for one who would invent a cake. 

Besides those which are baked, there is a large class 
of cakes and scones which are cooked on the Girdle. 
This utensil must be kept very clean and free from rust, 
and should be thoroughly heated before using. 

All cakes and biscuits should be kept well covered 
up from the air, — large cakes, to prevent their becom- 
ing dry ; small crisp cakes and biscuits, to prevent their 
becoming moist and soft. If this softening does happen, 
however, the original crispness may be partially restored 
by re-warming in the oven or before the fire. Such 
cakes &c. are, however, best when fresh made. 

Pound Cake. With nine whisked eggs, mix a pound 
each of pounded loaf-sugar, beaten fresh butter, and 
flour. Add these gradually in the order here given, 
beating up the mixture well with a horn spoon after 
each addition. Stir in a few chopped almonds and a 
flavouring of essence of lemon. Bake in a buttered 
tin pan for an hour. A very good cake may also be 
made with only half the above proportions of sugar, 
butter, and eggs ; the whites of the eggs, whisked sepa- 
rately, being added last in order. 

Flum Cake may be made by adding to the above 



138 CAKES AND 

half a pound each of cleaned and dried currants, stoned 
raisins, and candied lemon and orange-peel, together 
with a seasoning of nutmeg and cinnamon. 

Seed Cake consists of the ingredients of pound cake, 
with the addition of an ounce of carraway seeds. Some 
candied orange-peel may also be used in it, and the 
top may be strewed with carraway comfits. 

Rice Cake. With six whisked eggs mix half a pound 
each of finely-ground rice and sifted loaf-sugar, and 
then add a quarter of a pound of butter. Flavour with 
essence of lemon, beat the whole together for a quarter 
of an hour, and bake immediately in a buttered pan. 

Soda Cake. Mix together dry, one pound of flour, 
half a pound of sugar, and a teaspoonful of carbonate 
of soda, and then rub into this six ounces of fresh but- 
ter. Add half a pound of cleaned currants, and, if de- 
sired, a few blanched and chopped almonds, and some 
strips of candied lemon-peel. Make this dry mixture 
into a stiff batter with about half a pint of warm milk 
whisked up with three eggs. Beat the whole well to- 
gether, and bake it immediately. Instead of milk and 
eggs, buttermilk may be used, with which the other in- 
gredients should be made into a soft dough. 

Sweet Cake. Procure two pounds of fermented dough 
ready for the oven, and with this mix quickly three 
quarters of a pound of beaten butter, half a pound of 
sugar, and the same quantity of currants. This may 
be seasoned with a little ground cinnamon and grated 
nutmeg, or allspice, and carraway seeds. Work the 
whole well together with the hand, and bake it imme- 
diately in a buttered pan. Dripping, warmed with a 
little new milk, may be used instead of the butter. 

Sponge Cake. Whisk well together, in a basin set 
in warm water, a pound of finely-pounded sugar and 
twelve eggs. When these have become warm and ra- 
ther thick, remove the basin from the hot water, and 
continue whisking its contents until quite cold. Then 
stir in lightly one pound of sifted flour and the rind of 
a lemon chopped very finely, or grated upon one or two 



SCOTCH BUN. 139 

lumps of sugar, which are then pounded. When per- 
fectly mixed, pour it into a pan or mould prepared 
by smearing the inside with butter and then dusting 
it with as much dry flour as will adhere to it. Bake it 
in a moderate oven for an hour, or less if the form of 
the cake be not compact. Small Sponge-Cakes or Savoy 
Biscuits may have a larger proportion of sugar, and 
have powdered sugar sifted over them. They are baked 
in small moulds prepared as above with butter and 
finely-sifted sugar. The sponge-cake moulds should not 
be alDOve half filled, as the mixture rises considerably 
while baking. Potato-flour may be partly or wholly 
substituted for wheat-flour in the above. 

Scotch Bun. ■ With two pounds of baker's dough 
mix three quarters of a pound of butter, and reserve 
about a quarter of this mixture to cover the bun with. 
To the rest add two pounds of stoned raisins, a pound 
and a half of cleaned currants, a quarter of a pound of 
blanched almonds, two ounces each of candied orange and 
lemon-peel in small dice, and a quarter of an ounce each 
of pounded cloves, Jamaica pepper, and ginger. Knead 
these thoroughly together with the hand, and mould 
the mixture into the form of a thick round cheese. For 
the cover or casing, add a little flour to the reserved 
piece of dough if not stiff" enough, and then roll it out 
into two thin circular pieces, — one a little smaller than 
the bottom of the bun, and the other considerably 
larger, to cover the top and sides. Lay the bun, bottom 
upwards, in the centre of this larger piece ; place the 
smaller piece on the bottom, and gather up the margin 
of the former all round ; fold it over the edges of the 
bottom so as to join that of the other, wetting both 
margins to make them adhere. Place the covered bun 
upon a doubled sheet of grey paper floured, and bind 
a band of the same round the sides to preserve the 
shape. Prick it all over the top rather deeply with a 
long needle, and bake it in a moderate oven. 

Shortbread. Melt a pound of butter, either fresh or 
salt, and pour it, free from sediment, into a mixture of 



140 SHORTBREAD. 

a pound and a half of flour with a quarter of a pound 
of powdered sugar, — stirring- together quickly. Knead 
this (but not too much) with a quarter of a pound more 
flour upon the paste-board, and when mixed mould it 
into a cake of any desired shape, three quarters of an 
inch thick. Notch or scollop the edge, and ornament 
the top with carraway comfits and strips of candied 
orange-peel, arranged in any fanciful design. Bake it 
on a floured sheet of white paper placed upon a tin 
baking sheet in a moderate oven. Scotch Petticoat 
Tails consist of a large round cake of shortbread rather 
thinner than the above, cut, before baking, in a peculiar 
manner : a small circle is stamped out of the centre 
with the mouth of a cup or tumbler, and the remaining 
piece is cut into eight segments from the middle. Each 
of these may be decorated as above. They are served 
at the tea-table in their original arrangement. For this 
a little warm milk may be added to the oiled butter. 

Tea Cakes. Make a paste with half a pound of flour, 
a quarter of a pound of beaten butter, rather more of 
loaf-sugar, one Qgg, and some grated lemon-peel. Roll 
it out thin, and cut small round cakes from it. Brush 
them over with white of egg, sift pounded loaf-sugar 
over them, and bake upon a floured baking sheet in a 
quick oven. These cakes may be flavoured with car- 
raway seeds, cinnamon, allspice, &c., instead of lemon- 
peel. They may also be baked upon a girdle with 
paper under and a tin cover over them. Very good 
simple cakes may be made by seasoning as above with 
sugar, carraway seeds, and spice, a common pie-crust 
or pufl'-paste, to which a few currants may be added. 
Scraps of such paste left over when a pie or tart is 
covered, may thus be profitably used up. Bake in 
either of the above methods. 

French Biscuit. Take equal weights of eggs, sugar, 
and flour. Whisk the whites and yolks of the eggs 
separately. With the froth of the whites beat up the 
sugar, the flour, and then the yolks. Drop the batter 
in round shapes upon buttered sheets of paper. Bake 
in a quick oven. 



CAKEiS AND SCONES. 141 

Almond Biscuits are made by pounding about two 
ounces of blanched and dried sweet almonds and half 
an ounce of bitter almonds along with half a pound of 
loaf-sugar in a mortar ; and when these are intimately 
blended, beating them up with the whites of two eggs 
whisked to a froth, and two ounces of finely-ground 
rice. This light batter is' dropped in table-spoonfuls 
upon a baking-sheet, and baked in a slow oven. 

Macaroons are made similarly to the above, but omit- 
ting the rice and bitter almonds, and adding the whites 
(not previously whisked) gradually, while pounding the 
other ingredients in the mortar. 

Cakes or Scones for Breakfast. Make one pound of 
flour into a stiff dough with warm milk shghtly salted, 
and having one ounce of butter melted in it, to which 
add two beaten eggs. This dough must be well kneaded 
and then placed covered up before the fire for half-an 
hour, after which it is rolled out thin, stamped into 
round cakes, and cooked over the fire on a girdle 
dusted with flour. These are served hot, and buttered. 
Similar scones may be made without eggs, using an 
ounce more butter (which should be rubbed cold into 
the dry flour), and making the dough with cold butter- 
milk. A little carbonate of soda previously well mixed 
with the dry flour will convert this into dough for 8oda 
Scones. These must be made rather thicker. Their 
lightness is occasioned by the acid of the butter-milk 
slowly effervescing with the carbonate of soda within 
the dough, which thus becomes puffed up with innu- 
merable small bubbles of carbonic acid gas. 

Barley-meal Scones. Into a quart of boiling milk, 
seasoned with a tea-spoonful of salt, stir gradually as 
much barley-meal as will make a soft dough ; mix this 
with a little more barley-meal on the paste-board, roll it 
out rather thin, cut the scones about the size of a saucer, 
bake them on both sides upon a girdle, and as they 
are done, pile them one upon the other in a plate before 
the fire to keep soft and hot. Serve them hot upon a 
napkin. These are excellent breakfast scones. 



142 CAKES, SCONES, &C. 

■ Potato Scones are made of mashed boiled potatoes 
kneaded into a stiff dough with flour and a little butter 
and salt ; roll out, cut, and bake like the preceding. 

Oatmeal Cakes may be made simply by kneading 
oatmeal with water, very sHghtly salted, into a stiffi 
dough, rolling this out on the paste-board into a thin 
cake, and then baking it on the girdle. If preferred 
dry and crisp, the cake should be made as thin as 
possible, browned slightly on one side on the girdle, 
^and then toasted on the other side before the fire in a 
toaster which hooks on to the front of the grate, and 
has a back to support the cake. If wanted soft, it 
should be made rather thicker and be quickly browned 
on both sides on the girdle. Butter or good dripping 
is an improving addition in oatmeal cakes. It should 
be melted in boiling water, and the meal-dough made 
with this while hot. 

Cheese Cakes. Drain the whey from two quarts of 
milk curdled with rennet, Rub the curd through a 
sieve ; mix with it four ounces of beaten fresh butter, 
three ounces of pounded loaf-sugar, the same of cleaned 
currants, half-an-ounce of sweet almonds and three or 
four bitter ones blanched and pounded, three whisked 
eggs, a little minced citron and grated lemon-peel, with a 
glass of brandy. This mixture is baked in patty-pans 
lined with puff-paste. Rice Cheese-Cakes are made with- 
out curd, and consist of equal quantities of ground rice, 
pounded loaf-sugar, and beaten butter, with the beaten 
yolk of one ^^^ for every two ounces of the mixture, 
and half that quantity of beaten whites. This is fla- 
voured with a little brandy and grated lemon-peel, and 
baked as above. 

Gingerbread. With six ounces of beaten butter mix 
the same quantity of brown sugar, one pound of flour, 
one pound of treacle, two beaten eggs, and a quarter 
of an ounce of carbonate of soda. For spicing, mix in 
two ounces of carraway seeds and an ounce and a half 
of ground ginger. A little candied orange-peel may 
be added. The mixture should stand for a night, and 



BREAD. 143 

next day be well worked together, and baked in a 
shallow buttered tin in a slow oven for two hours. 

Bread. This is so generally procured ready-made 
from the baker's, that a receipt for it here will hardly 
be thought necessary. It may however be interesting 
to know the nature of the process upon which its 
lightness depends. The fermentation of bread is iden- 
tical with that by which wine, beer, ale, &c. are made, 
and wort prepared for the distillation of spirits. It 
consists of a chemical transmutation, by means of yeast, 
of the sugar and part of the fibrine or gluten of the 
wheat flour, into carbonic acid gas and alcohol, which 
being diffused through the dough and expanded by the 
heat of the oven, puff up the bread and render it light 
and porous. Sourness in bread is occasioned by delay- 
ing to bake the fermented dough until a second process 
has commenced, by which vinegar is generated from 
the alcohol ; hence it is necessary to attend particularly 
to the time required to ferment the dough. Unfer- 
mented bread is made light by means of carbonate of 
soda and a dilute acid. The soda is intimately mixed 
with the dry flour, and with this the dough is made 
with the acid and water. The carbonate of soda meet- 
ing with the acid within the dough, gives off its car- 
bonic acid with a slow effervescence ; this gas raises the 
dough in the same way as in fermented bread, while 
the soda forms a new compound with the acid. If mu- 
riatic acid be employed in the proper chemical propor- 
tion, this new compound is common salt, which is thus 
useful in seasoning the bread, and no other need be 
used. Unfermented bread is said to be more economi- 
cal than the other, as in it there is no destruction of 
nutritious substances to produce the carbonic acid gas. 
It is also recommended to persons liable to heartburn, 
which the use of fermented bread is apt to occasion, as 
it is sometimes not sufficiently baked to check its ten- 
dency to become sour. 

Plain biscuits are not fermented, but are made 
simply with a stiff well-kneaded dough of flour and 



144 JELLIES. 

water, properly seasoned with salt. They are baked 
in a quick oven, being pricked to prevent their being 
blistered by the steam formed within them. The va- 
rious kinds of French fancy bread are made by the 
introduction of milk, butter, and eggs, into the dough 
before fermenting it. Their appearance is varied by 
the moulds or pans in which they are baked. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

JELLIES, PRESERVES, PICKLES, &c. 

Op Jellies there are various kinds. The basis or ge- 
latinizing principle of some is animal gelatine, either 
in the form of Isinglass, or prepared Gelatine, or as 
extracted from Calves' feet, &c. In others it is a 
vegetable substance, such as Arrowroot, or some other 
variety of starch. In Fruit Jellies, which however may 
rather be classed with preserves, it is a substance called 
Pectine, which abounds more or less in nearly all fruits. 

The jelly-bag used for straining jellies is made of 
flannel. It should be conical in form, about sixteen 
inches deep, closely sewed, and bound round the mouth 
with broad tape, to which four tape loops are attached, 
by which, when in use, it is suspended from a wooden 
stand or frame. This consists of four upright bars 
three feet high, connected at the top and near the 
bottom by cross bars about ten inches long. A couple 
of lieavy chairs placed back to back about a foot apart 
make a very good substitute for this frame. Before 
using it, the bag should be dipped in warm water 
and wrung out; after use, it should be turned inside 
out, steeped in cold ,water, washed with soap, well 
rinsed, and dried. 

Clear Calfs-Foot Jelly. The stock for this should 
be prepared the day previous to being used. Set on 
the fire, in nearly three quarts of water, two calf-feet. 



JELLIES. 145 

well cleaned and cut in pieces. Keep them simmering 
for five hours, or until the water is reduced about 
one half, skimming occasionally. Then pass the liquor 
through a hair-sieve into a basin, and allow it to cool 
and become firm. Next day remove the oil and fat, 
and wipe the jelly quite clean. Place in a stew-pan 
half a pound of loaf-sugar, the juice of four lemons and 
the rinds of two, a gill of sherry, the same of water, 
and the whites and shells of five eggs. Whisk these 
together until the sugar is melted, then add the jelly- 
stock cut in pieces, and continue whisking the whole 
over the fire until boiling. Then after it has stood off 
the fire closely covered for half an hour to settle, strain 
it through a clean flannel jelly-bag hung before the 
fire. If not quite clear, which the first that comes 
through may not be, return it to the bag. When it 
is perfectly transparent, it is ready to be poured into 
moulds or glasses, which should be quite filled. To 
remove it when set, from the mould, place this for a 
minute or so in lukewarm water, strike the sides of it 
gently, and when the jelly seems loosened, place the 
dish on which it is to be served, on the top, turn the 
whole over, and carefully remove the mould so as not 
to lift or break the jelly. All jellies in moulds are 
dished in the same way. 

A plainer kind of Calf-Foot Jelly may be made 
wi^-h ale and vinegar instead of wine and lemon-juice. 
The stock may also be prepared from Cow-heels. They 
produce a jelly, which though firm and clear, is perhaps 
not quite so free from meat flavour. The flavour may 
be varied by substituting for the wine some maraschino, 
noyeau, cura9oa, &c. Spices, such as coriander seeds, 
allspice, cinnamon, and cloves, may likewise be used. 
Orange and Lemon Jellies are made by flavouring the 
clarified stock with a syrup of the juice of these fruits 
with some of their rind boiled in it. A little cochineal 
is sometimes used to impart a richer tint to the jelly. 

Similar Clear Jellies may be made with isinglass, 
gelatine, or hartshorn shavings; four and a hnlf ounces

of either of tlie first, or half a pound of the last, being 
equivalent to the above number of calf's feet. They 
are treated precisely in the same way. 

More ornamental jellies may be made by introducing 
ripe or preserved fruits cut in slices and arranged in 
layers alternately with tlie jelly, or otherwise imbedded 
in it. In doing this, however, each layer of jelly must 
be allowed to set before the next one of fruit is added, 
else the two will become mingled, thus spoiling the 
appearance of the whole. 

Blancmange, This is an opaque white jelly made 
with isinglass and milk. Simmer an ounce and a 
half of isinglass in a quart of new milk, along with 
some cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon-peel. Stir the 
whole over the fire till the isinglass dissolves, sweeten 
it to tsLste with loaf-sugar, and then strain it through 
a muslin sieve. After allowing it to stand to settle for 
a few minutes, pour it into a mould, keeping back the 
sediment. When cold and firm, it is turned out as 
above directed. A paste of pounded sweet almonds, 
with four or five bitter ones, may be added to this be- 
fore straining it. 

Very similar Blancmanges may be made with arrow- 
root, ground rice, or Irish moss. Three tablespoonfuls 
of arrowroot will be sufiicient for a quart of milk. It 
should be smoothly mixed cold with a small quantity 
of the milk, and when the rest, already sweetened, is 
boiling, this is added to it. The whole immediately 
becomes thickened, and after being briskly stirred 
over the fire for about three minutes, it is ready for 
pouring into the mould. This jelly may be flavoured 
with essence of lemon, pounded almonds, &c. There is 
an excellent and cheap substitute for arrowroot called 
Pithi^ia, which may be used exactly in the same way. 
Rice Blancmange requires very much longer boiling to 
make it smooth, during which it must be constantly 
stirred to prevent its burning. Irish or Iceland Moss 
is a kind of sea-weed. It is sold by the druggists in a 
dried state. Before using, it should be picked clean.

and then steeped in cold water for twelve hours at 
least. It swells up by absorbing a great deal of water, 
and becomes very softv If then drained and boiled for 
twenty minutes or so in milk, it dissolves almost en- 
tirely, and converts the milk, when cold, into a firm 
jelly. An ounce of the Moss will suffice for a pint and 
a half of milk. It should be constantly stirred while 
boiling, sweetened, and seasoned to taste with stick- 
cinnamon or other spice. Before pouring it into the 
mould, it should be strained through muslin to remove 
any fibres that may remain undissolved. Red currant 
jelly forms an agreeable garnish and accompaniment to 
a dish of blancmange. 



PRESERVES.— Under this head are included Fruit 
Jellies, Jam, Marmalade, and Fruits preserved ivkole. 
The preserving ingredient in them all is sugar. The 
fruit should always be gathered on a dry day, and, par- 
ticularly for preserving whole, ought to be perfectly ripe 
and in good condition. For all kinds of Jam, equal 
weights of sugar and fruit are about the average pro- 
portions required, — sweet luscious fruit, such as straw- 
berries, of course requiring rather less sugar, and very 
tart fruit, like red currants, a little more. The fruit 
must be picked free from all stalks, leaves, &c. Plums, 
damsons, and cherries should be stoned, the larger kinds 
of plums cut in quarters, and those with tough or acid 
skins may be scalded and peeled. The fruit may be 
boiled with the sugar in the preserving-pan, for a time 
varying from fifteen minutes to half an hour, according 
to the kind of fruit ; thus tough-skinned gooseberries 
will reqiiire the full time, while strawberries, rasps, (fcc. 
will take less. During this process, all scum that rises 
should be quickly skimmed off". If the v>^eather pre- 
vious to gathering has been unusually dry, a little water 
may be added. The addition of some red-currant juice 
to strawberry jam imparts a tartness in which that pre- 
serve is otherwise deficient. An admixture of rasp- 
berries greatly improves the flavour of red currant jam. 



148 PllKSERVES. 

A few cloves make an excellent addition to gooseberry 
jam. The preserving-pan is of brass, and must be kept 
sciipulously clean and free from verdigris, and be washed 
out with vinegar immediately before using. A per- 
forated skimmer is the best instrument for removing 
the scum. When potted, all kinds of jam should stand 
till quite cold before being covered. 

Fruit Jellies. — Those from ripe juicy fruits are 
best made as follows : — 

Red Currant Jelly. Having freed the fruit from 
stalks, leaves, &c., mash it so as to break every currant. 
Then suspend it in a clean flannel jelly-bag, and set a 
basin beneath to catch the clear juice as it trickles 
through ; the bag must not be squeezed, else the juice 
will be turbid. Boil the juice for a quarter of an hour 
in the preserving-pan, with loaf-sugar in the proportion 
of a pound to each pint, — carefully removing all scum 
as it rises. The best test of its being sufficiently boiled 
is to cool rapidly a tablespoonful in a saucer placed in 
cold water : if it forms a weak jelly it is boiled enough, 
but if it remains quite fluid, the boiling should be con- 
tinued. It should be- potted in small gallipots. Rasps in 
the proportion of a third, mashed along with the cur- 
rants, greatly improve the flavour of red currant jelly. 

For Apple Jelly, the apples, pared, cored, and sliced, 
must be stewed before mashing. A mixture of apples 
and damsons produces a jelly of a rich ruby tint, with 
an agreeable tartness which simple apple jelly wants. 

Gooseberry Jelly is made from unripe • green fruit, 
which also requires to be stewed before mashing. 

The fruit pulp from which the juice has been drained 
to make jellies as above described, will in most cases 
make a very good, though coarse, kind of Jam, well 
adapted for Roll Puddings, &c., by being boiled up with 
ougar as previously directed for jam. 

Rhuharh, being deficient in pectine, Avill not produce 
a jelly ; but a very palatable sort of jam, which keeps 
well, may be made from it, some whole ginger, previous- 
ly boiled till tender, being stewed along with it. 



PRESERVES. 149 

The covering or " papering up" of jellj and jam is 
best deferred till the day after they are made. By 
that time the jelly ought to give distinct indications of 
congealing. If it does not, the safest plan is to give it 
another " boil up." Two different covers of paper are 
requisite. The inner one is of thin clean writing paper 
a quarter of an inch larger than the mouth of the pot, 
and snipped to that depth all round the edge. This is 
steeped in a saucer of whiskey or other spirit, and laid 
close upon the surface of the jelly or jam, so that there 
is no air underneath it ; the nicked edges being turned 
up against the sides of the pot. A teaspoonful of spirits 
is then poured on the top of this, and an outer cover of 
stout paper stretched over the mouth, and firmly secured 
over the lip of the pot with a piece of twine passed two 
or three times round and tied. Each pot should have 
the name of its contents written on the outside cover. 
Thus prepared, jelly and jam will, if they have been 
sufficiently boiled, keep for a long time in a dry cool 
place. During the first month, the pots should be 
opened once or twice, and if the inner papers have be- 
come mouldy, they should be removed and fresh ones 
substituted, with a little more spirits. If the mouldi- 
ness appears a second time, and seems inveterate, the 
contents of the pot can only be saved from spoiling by 
being boiled over again. 

Marmalade is a preserve similar to jam, made from 
the larger kinds of ripe fruit. The most general fa- 
vourite is the 

Scotch Orange- Marmalade. There are several ways 
of making this, of which the following is one : — Procure 
equal weights of ripe bitter or Seville oranges, and 
loaf-sugar. With a few of the pieces of sugar, grate 
off some of the outside of the rinds. Cut the oranges 
in quarters, and squeeze out the juice into a basin, 
through a sieve to keep back the seeds. With a teaspoon 
scrape out the soft pulp from the interior cavities of the 
oranges, rejecting the seeds. Detach from the rinds the 
remaining parts of the inside of the oranges, wash these 



150 PRESERVES. 

well in a little water, and put this water and the soft 
pulp into the juice in the basin : what has been washed 
is now refuse. The rinds are then boiled under a close 
cover until so tender as to be easily pierced by a straw 
or pin's-head, the water being once changed to remove 
some of the bitterness. The spongy white part is now 
scraped from the inside of the rind, and the remaining 
portion clipped with scissors into very thin chips or 
parings about half an inch long. Boil these along with 
the sugar, pulp, and juice, for fifteen or twenty minutes 
over a quick fire, skimming it when any scum rises. A 
little lemon-juice and grated peel is an improvement. 
This marmalade is sometimes varied by pounding to a 
pulp part of the rinds, and having the rest in chips. 
This however very much impairs the transparency of 
the fluid portion. If the quantity of rinds seems too 
large, some of them may be withheld, or the fluid part 
may be eked out with apple jelly. Lemon Marmalade 
is made in the same Avay, but with a half m.ore sugar. 

Apricot and Melon Marmalades are made by re- 
moving the skins, stones, seeds, &c., mincing the eat- 
able part, and boiling it with its weight of sugar. For 
Quince Malmalade the fruit should be first stewed and 
then mashed to a pulp. After being potted, marma- 
]ade should stand for a day, and then be papered up as 
already directed for jelly and jam. 



Fruits Preserved Whole. — The fruits thus treated 
should be fresh, plump and ripe, and as perfect and free 
from injury as can be procured. They are preserved 
by simmering them for a short time in a clear syrup 
in the preserving pan, allowing them to steep, covered 
with this syrup, in an earthenware basin or tureen for 
a day or two, simmering them again, and so on alter- 
nately until the fruit has become thoroughly impreg- 
nated with sugar, which will require a time proportioned 
to the size of the fruit. The syrup should at first be thin, 
and afterwards gradually increased in strength by the 
addition of more sugar at each boiling. If this is not 



PRESERVES. 151 

attended to, the fruit, instead of being plump and trans- 
parent when done, will become shrivelled and unsightly. 
The entire quantity of sugar required is generally about 
a fourth more than the weight of fruit. — When the fruit 
has received its final simmering, and become clear and 
transparent, it should be placed in earthenware or glass 
jars, the syrup poured boiling hot over it, and when 
cold, covered with wet bladder tied over the jar. In 
transferring the fruit from one vessel to the other, it 
should be lifted out of the syrup as gently as possible 
with a silver spoon, so as not to injure it. If towards 
the end of the above process the syrup becomes tur- 
bid, it may be separated from the fruit, and clari- 
fied like soup by means of white of egg. This is 
mixed gradually with it while cold, and when coagu- 
lated by boiling, it seizes upon the impurities, and 
with them rises to the surface as a thick scum, which 
must then be skimmed off. A little cold water added 
after the first minute's boiling facilitates the ascent of 
the scum. A red colour may be imparted where desired, 
or the colour of red fruits heightened, and the syrup 
tinged, by the addition of a little cochineal. Port wine 
is also used for the same purpose, with apples, pears, and 
quinces. Green fruits may have their colour improved 
by being previously laid in a vessel with green cabbage- 
leaves under and over them, and thus scalded with boil- 
ing water, closely covered, and allowed to cool. This pro- 
cess is repeated, using fresh leaves each time, till the 
desired efi'ect is produced. A very little pounded alum 
added to the water assists the operation. Tartness may 
be imparted to the more luscious fruits by means of 
lemon-juice. Spices also, such as ginger and cloves, may 
be used where considered appropriate. Many kinds of 
of fruit thus preserved may be dried in the sun or a 
slow oven, and served at dessert in a candied state. 

Jargonelle Pears and Pippins must be pared, and if 
the seeds are picked out at the flower-end with a bodkin 
or toothpick, the preserved fruit will keep better. 

Plums, Apricots, and other stone-fruit, should have 



152 PRESERVES. 

the stones removed by a small slit in the side, keeping 
the fi'uit as whole as possible. The tough-skinned fruits 
may also be peeled, which a previous scalding will facili- 
tate. The kernels may be blanched and simmered in 
the syrup to impart their flavour. A simple method of 
preserving such fruits is to prick them with a needle, 
drop them into a wide-mouthed bottle with some 
pounded loaf-sugar, fill up the bottle with brandy, cork 
it, and then bake in a slow oven for some hours. The 
cork may then be sealed, to prevent access of air. 

Cucumbers and Melons are first steeped in salt and 
water for a couple of days, and then in fresh water for 
the same time. They are then " greened " by the pro- 
cess above described, after which the seeds and soft 
parts are scooped out by an incision in the side, and 
some ginger, cloves, and whole white pepper inserted. 
They are then treated with syrup in the usual manner. 
Large thin-skinned Bitter Oranges are preserved some- 
what in the same manner. After the steeping, the pulp 
is extracted at a hole made in the top, and the juice 
expressed from it, strained, and added to the syrup. 
This preserve may be ornamented by making a sort of 
cameo carving of leaves &c. upon the rinds before re- 
moving the pulp. When served, the hollow skins may 
be filled with custard, or various jellies, &c. 

Gooseberries, both red and green, should be chosen 
rather unripe. They should be " topped and tailed," 
and each one pricked Avith a needle. Their appearance 
is improved by picking out the seeds. 

Straivberries should first lie covered with dry sugar 
for a night. Their weight of sugar is then made into 
a thin syrup with red-currant juice, and in this they are 
simmered till the syrup will congeal when cold. They 
mnsi be very gently handled to avoid breaking them. 

PICKLES. — These are used as relishes and garnish- 
ings for various dishes, and also as ingredients in many 
sauces. They consist of various kinds of esculent vege- 
tables preserved in spiced vinegar, this being wholly or 



PICKLES. 153 

partially substituted for their natural juices, which are 
first usually extracted by means of salt. The vege- 
tables should be fresh and sound, and not too ripe. 
They should be gathered on a dry day, carefully trim- 
med and wiped, and only those washed which require 
steeping or salting. The vinegar and spices used should 
not be stinted, the only limit to the quantity of the 
latter being that they ought not to overpower the 
flavour of the vegetables. 

The general mode of making pickles is as follows : — 
The vegetables having been previously prepared in the 
way suited to their kind, are placed in a stone-ware 
jar, and the vinegar with the spice in it (whole black 
and white pepper, and ginger) is made boiling hot and 
poured over them. The jar is then covered with a 
thickly-folded cloth in order to keep in the steam. 
If the vegetables are large and solid, such as cucumbers, 
this process is repeated several times with the same 
vinegar till they become saturated with it. In such 
cases the spices need not be added till the last boiling, 
else some of their strength will be lost. With green 
vegetables, whose colour is impaired by their preliminary 
preparation, a number of cabbage or vine leaves may 
be mixed. These having partially restored the colour 
during the above process, are of course removed. When 
cold, the jar is fitted with a cork, which may be made 
air-tight by dipping it in melted bottle-wax or tying 
a piece of wetted bladder over it. If after the first 
two days the vegetables soak up much of the vinegar, 
more should be added, so as to keep them covered. A 
stoneware pipkin is the most suitable vessel for heating 
the vinegar in, because metal is corroded and dissolved 
by the acid. On this account, brass and copper ves- 
sels ought never to be used, their solutions in vinegar 
being highly poisonous ; notwithstanding which, how- 
ever, pickle-manufacturers are said to be sometimes 
rash enough to use such to heighten the colour of their 
green pickles. As boiling evaporates the strength of 
the vinegar, it ought merely to be heated to the boiling 



154 PICKLES. 

point and used immediately. If the vinegar is wanted 
very hotly spiced, a little cayenne may be used in it. 

Red Cahhage. The outer blades being i-emoved, cut 
the cabbage in half length-ways, wash it free from dirt, 
and then cut it across in slices as thin as possible, be- 
ginning at the top. Sprinkle the sliced cabbage thickly 
with salt, and let it remain thus for a day. The salt 
extracts the juice, which is then drained off through a 
collander. The cabbage, drained as dry as possible, is 
then treated with vinegar and spice as already directed, 
until it resumes its original plumpness, which may be 
after the first or second scalding. A few onions pre- 
pared as below, and sliced among the cabbage, make a 
very good mixture. 

Onions. Choose small silver onions as equal in size 
as posssible Cut off the tops and tails, but not too 
close, and cover the onions with boiling brine in a 
basin. Next day repeat this scalding, peel them when 
cool, and throw each as it is done, into vinegar. They 
are then ready for the boiling vinegar and spice. As 
unpeeled onions are blackened by exposure to the air, 
this must be avoided as much as possible, by keeping 
them always covered with brine or vinegar as above 
directed. 

Beetroot. The tops being removed, it must be washed, 
but nowhere cut or injured, else the juice, which in 
this case is to be preserved for the sake of its colour, 
will be lost. It is then boiled in plenty of salted water 
till tender, which may be in about half an hour. The 
skin is now rubbed off with a coarse cloth, the beet- 
root sliced across, put into a jar, and the vinegar and 
spice poured over it. This pickle makes a pleasing 
garnish. A little salt added improves the taste, but 
slightly impairs its brilliant colour. 

Caulifioiver or Brocoli. The centre or flower part 
only is used. Being well cleaned, it is immersed for 
about four minutes in boiling brine, and then drained. 
When tolerably dry, it is divided into conveniently- 
sized pieces, the stalks being cut smoothly, — packed in 



PICKLES. 155 

the jars in which it is to be kept,, and covered with 
the boiling vinegar and spice. This vegetable may be 
very well mixed with any other white or green pickles. 
In making such mixtures, the various vegetables, if 
they are not all procurable in perfection at the same 
time, may each be prepared and added in their proper 
seasons. Nasturtiums, not over ripe, are pickled in the 
same way. 

Mushrooms. Put small white button-mushrooms, 
wiped clean, into a stone jar along Avith the spices and 
a little salt. Set the jar over a slow fire, or in a pot 
of boiling water, and let the mushrooms stew in their 
own liquor till that is nearly all evaporated. Then add 
as much hot vinegar as will cover them, and let this 
just come to the boil. When cold, bottle them up, 
add a little more vinegar at the end of the first week 
if they require it, and then cork them. 

Cucumbers. The preparation of these is the same 
as for preserving (see p. 152), except that they are not 
steeped in fresh water, and that hot vinegar is used in 
the " greening" process (see p. 152) instead of water. 
When the desired tint is attained, the green leaves are 
removed, the vinegar heated for the last time (adding 
the spice, which in this case may include cloves and 
crushed nutmeg), and poured over the cucumbers. 

Gherkins, French Beans, and other green pickles, 
are prepared in the same manner. 

Cucumbers and Onions, as a mixed pickle, are pre- 
pared by skinning large onions, paring the cucumbers 
and removing their seeds, slicing both in thick slices, 
strewing them thickly with salt in a collander, allowing 
them to drain for a night, and then alternately heating 
and cooling them with vinegar in a covered stone jar 
until well saturated. Lastly, the same vinegar is heated 
till boiling, along with spices, and poured over them. 

Walnuts. Procure them unripe, and with tender 
shells. If they are wanted green, the greatest care 
must be taken during their preparation not to expose 
them for any length of time to the air, which blackens 



156 SALTING MEAT. 

them. Steep them for nine days in strong brine, chan- 
gin,^ this twice during the time, and keeping them im- 
mersed in it by means of a board floating over them. 
Drain them, prick each in several places with a large 
needle, and then " green" them bj the process described 
on p. 152, until the husks become tender. These are 
then quickly scraped off with a knife, and each walnut 
rubbed smooth with flannel and immediately thrown 
into hot water. The vinegar and spices, including 
cloves and cayenne, to which some salt is added, are 
then prepared ; and when these are boiling hot, the 
walnuts must be quickly removed from the water, dried 
with a cloth, placed in the jars in which they are to be 
kept, and covered with the boiling vinegar. — Walnuts 
are pickled hlack more easily. They are first pricked 
with a needle, then steeped for twelve days in the 
brine (which should be poured on them boiling hot 
and changed every three days), and lastly, after being 
drained and rubbed smooth and dry, they are covered 
as above with the boiling vinegar seasoned with horse- 
radish, garlic, mustard seed, and pepper. 



CHAPTER XIV. 
MISCELLANEA. 

SALTING MEAT.— The preceding chapter treats of 
Pickles, properly so called. Pickled Meat, however, is 
prepared by a very difl'erent process, in which brine is 
the antiseptic employed. This brine may be made as 
follows : — Six pounds of salt, one of brown sugar, and 
four coinces of saltpetre, boiled in four gallons of water, 
skimmed, and allowed to cool. The meat is kept en- 
tirely covered with this in a tub or wooden trough. 
When the brine becomes turbid and covered with scum 
it must either be renewed, or re-boiled and skimmed. 



SALTING MEAT. 157 

This is the mode adopted for salting large quantities 
of meat, to be kept in store for a long time. A single 
piece of meat for immediate use is generally salted by 
rubbing it in every part with a dry mixture of common 
salt, sugar, and saltpetre, in the proportion of half an 
ounce of each of the last to a pound of the first. It 
is then placed in a deep glazed earthenware pan or dish, 
and strewed with the mixture, which in a day's time 
extracts a considerable quantity of the juice of the meat, 
forming with this a strong brine, with which the meat 
must be daily basted and rubbed till required, turning 
it over in the pan each time, so that every part may be 
equally salted. A Round of Beef thus treated will be 
ready for use in four or five days, its saltness depend- 
ing upon the time. The salt in this case preserves the 
meat partly by extracting its moisture, which is an 
active agent in the decomposition of animal substances. 
The loss of juice which meat sustains while being salted 
is even greater than in boiling, and hence arises the 
unwholesomeness of salted meat as a constant article of 
diet. The use of an impure salt containing chlorides 
of calcium and magnesium, although less palatable, is 
said partially to prevent this, by transforming an im- 
portant soluble constituent of the juice, called phosphate 
of soda, into the phosphates of lime and magnesium, 
which being insoluble remain in the meat. When such 
meat is eaten along with vegetables, the soda which 
these contain is supposed during digestion to decom- 
pose the insoluble phosphates and reproduce the origi- 
nal phosphate of soda. The saltpetre gives the meat a 
bright red colour. Pepper and other spices are some- 
times mixed with the salt. 

The antiseptic property of smolce as used in curing 
hams &c., depends upon the vapour oi creosote it con- 
tains. The addition of this liquid, in the propoi:tion of 
one part in a hundred, to the brine in which hams or 
tongues are pickled, produces all the eff'ects of smoking. 
Previous to salting, meat should have been kept till 
ready for cooking, and the kernels ought to be cut out. 



158 SALTING MEAT. 

The principal of these lie in the udder and centre fat 
of a round of beef, and in the thick end of the flank. 

Pork requires rather longer salting than beef. 

Collared Beef consists of the end of the brisket, or 
the flank, salted as above. When it has lain in salt for 
a week or ten days, take out the bones, remove the 
inside skin, strew the meat thickly with a mixture of 
grated nutmeg, black pepper, allspice, chopped lemon- 
thyme and parsley, roll it up tightly, and sew it up in a 
strong cloth bandage. It is now ready for boiling (see 
p. 42.) It may also be baked in a large jar of water. 
The cloth should not be removed till it is quite cold. 



Sausages. Of these there are many kinds. They 
consist of a highly- seasoned mixture of finely-minced 
lean and fat of meat, to which bread-crumbs, yolk of 
egg, and shred sweet herbs are sometimes added. Both 
fresh and salted meat are used, and variety is obtained 
by mixing different kinds of meat together. The mix- 
ture is either stuffed into clean gut-skins by means of 
an instrument for the purpose, and twisted in links, or 
moulded into rolls or flat cakes, in which form it is only 
adapted for frying or baking in a pie. For this last 
purpose exhausted meat from soup &c., or the cold re- 
mains of roast or boiled meat, may be very well intro- 
duced. Some kinds of sausages are smoked, by which 
means they are made capable of being kept for a con- 
siderable time. 

Potted Head. Although called potted head, this may 
be made from almost any gelatinous part of veal, or 
from cow heels or head. The meat is first simmered till 
tender, cut into very small pieces (not minced), rejecting 
the hard gristles, and then highly seasoned, and boiled 
for some time with the same liquor strained. It is then 
poured into earthenware moulds, from which when cold 
and very firm it is turned out and served garnished 
with parsley or pickled beetroot. Minced lemon-peel 
and juice maybe added to the seasonings of potted veal.. 
Mustard and vinejrar are favourite condiments for this 



POTTED MEAT. 159 

dish ; to which also a simple vegetable salad makes an 
excellent accompaniment. ' 

Potted Meat consists of the flesh of beef (either fresh 
or slightly salted), game, or poultry, cut in pieces, high- 
ly seasoned, packed closely in an earthen jar, in which 
it is then slowly stewed with very little water, either in 
a moderate oven or a pot of boiling water. When very 
tender, a smaller jar is placed upon it with a heavy 
weight resting upon this, and it is thus pressed till cold, 
and converted into a solid compact mass. It is then 
covered with a layer of clarified butter, and a piece of 
soaked bladder tied over the jar. The meat being thus 
protected from the air, will keep good for several months. 
It is eaten cold for breakfast, or made into sandwiches 
for lunch or supper. Meat already cooked, or which 
has been used in making soup or gravy, may be potted 
by pounding it in a mortar to a smooth paste along 
with a little butter and seasonings, which may in- 
clude dried and powdered sweet herbs, &c. It should 
be cooked in small jars as above, and covered with but- 
ter and bladder. Sprats, herrings, and shrimps, may 
also be potted in the same way, — of course rejecting the 
bones and shells. 

SALADS. — Salad consists of uncooked fresh young 
vegetables and herbs of various kinds, with a creamy, 
pungent, acid sauce. Lettuce is generally the chief 
ingredient employed, — radishes, onions, cucumber, mus- 
tard-cress, tfec, being frequently added in due propor- 
tions as flavourers. All the vegetables should be pro- 
cured as fresh and crisp as possible, and are generally, 
but especially the lettuce, the better of lying for an 
hour or two in cold spring water before using. They 
must then be carefully washed from grit and insects, 
freed from all decayed or worm-eaten leaves, sliced 
rather small, and after being gently dried by shaking 
them lightly in a clean towel, placed in a deepish salad- 
basin. There are many ways of making the sauce, 
vinegar and Florence oil being generally the chief con- 
stituents, with hard-boiled yolks of eggs and cream to 
f 



160 SALADS. 

impart richness, and a seasoning of pepper and salt and 
freshly-made mustard. The yolks of eggs, which should 
be perfectly cold, are first bruised down along with the 
cream ; the other ingredients are then added, and the 
whole well mixed, poured over the salad, and stirred up 
with it immediately before serving. The hard whites 
of the eggs may be cut across so as to form rings, and 
laid on the top as a garnish. Raw eggs (whites and 
yolks beaten together) may be substituted for the hard 
yolks, cream, and oil Another very simple salad-sauce, 
adapted for lettuce alone, is composed merely of sugar 
and vinegar. Salads are excellent accompaniments to 
cold meat in summer, being wholesome and cooling. 

French Salads are made by slicing down cold meat 
with the vegetables. The cold remains of any kind of 
meat or poultry may thus be economically employed. 
In the sauce for such salads, more salt is required than 
for vegetables alone, and the other seasonings may be 
varied to suit the kind of meat ; — the boiled egg-yolks 
and cream may be omitted. 

Lobster Salad is made by mixing the meat of a cold 
boiled lobster cut in pieces, with the salad vegetables ; 
pieces of the coral being used as garnish, and the spawn 
pounded with a little butter or oil to enrich the sauce. 

A refreshing variety of salad to be eaten along with 
cold meat, is made with cucumber and onions. A 
middling-sized cucumber, not fully ripe, is pared and 
then sliced across as thin as possible. This may be done 
rapidly by holding a thin table-knife firmly on a large 
plate, so that the blade lies flat upon the bottom with- 
out quite touching it except at the point, and then 
rapidly rubbing the cucumber across the knife, so that 
at each stroke a shaving is cut as thick as the space 
between the blade and the bottom of the plate. One 
or two large onions are sliced among the cucumber, 
and the whole thickly strewn with salt. This in a short 
time will extract a great part of the juice, which must 
be poured off. The slices are then well peppered and 
about half covered with vinegar. A little oil may be 



BEVERAGES. 161 

added. This prepai-ation, from its pungency and acidity, 
is perhaps more allied to pickles than salads, and con- 
sequently cannot be partaken of so largely. 

Fruit Salad for Dessert. In a glass or other orna- 
mental dish spread some ripe luscious fruit (say straw- 
berries) and pounded loaf sugar in alternate layers, so 
as to form a pyramid, and over this squeeze the juice 
of a lemon until the sugar is saturated. Very ripe 
sweet oranges, peeled and cut across in slices, may be 
dressed in the same way. 



BEVERAGES.— The most important of those which 
come within the province of the cook are certainly Tea 
and Coffee, and for the making of these a greater variety 
of methods has been suggested than for perhaps any 
other similar process. The chief object in making either 
is perfectly to extract the whole of their soluble matter 
without the loss of the more volatile portion, upon which 
their fine flavour and also part of their stimulating pro- 
perties depend. To effect this it is essential that the 
process should be performed as quickly as is consistent 
with its being done completely. 

In the case of Tea, this end is best attained when 
the following conditions are attended to : \&t, To have 
the water hoiling ; 2d, To have the teapot hot and dr// 
when the tea is put in ; 'dd. To allow the tea to stand 
for a few minutes in the pot in front of the fire or in 
the oven in order that it also may be thoroughly warmed 
and dried, before pouring the boiling water over it; 
ith. To keep the teapot hot in front of the fire, or by 
covering it with a thick flannel cover, during the process 
of infusion. It has been recommended for the same 
purpose to infuse the tea in a tin " infuser " which 
hooks on to the front of the grate, but there is some 
danger that in this way the tea v/ould be boiled, in which 
case its volatile "aroma" would be instantly dissipated. 
If the above conditions are observed, the heat of the 
water poured upon the tea is not wasted in heating the 
cold teapot ; and from the tea being first perfectly dried, 

M 



162 BEVERAGES. 

the hot water instantly rushes by capillary attraction 
into its minutest cells, and the process of extraction 
commences at the first instant of contact. When tea 
is made for a number of people, it is best to use two 
teapots; fresh tea being prepared in one while the 
other is in use. If only one teapot is used, it is better 
not to infuse the whole quantity of tea at once, filling 
up the pot with hot water as the first infusion is poured 
out, but rather to reserve some of it to be added from 
time to time along with the water. By this means the 
first and last cups may be served out equally good, in- 
stead of all the finer flavour being confined to the former, 
and the coarse, dark-coloured, bitter vegetable extract 
dispensed in the latter. The usual quantity of tea em- 
ployed is a little more than one heaped tea-spoonful for 
every two cups required. 

In making Coffee the same precautions should be 
observed. M. Soyer recommends stirring the dry cof- 
fee in a stewpan over the fire till quite hot. Boiling 
water being then added in the proportion of a quart to 

^ every two ounces of coffee, it is kept closely covered 
beside the fire for five minutes, strained through a 
cloth, re-warmed, and served in the cofiee-pot. The 
French add an equal quantity of boiling milk before 
re-warming. There are many other modes of making 
cofl'ee, and various contrivances for filtering it, but 
whichever is adopted, the utensils employed and the 
coffee powder ought to be heated. Where coffee is 
made every day, it is an economical plan to pour upon 
the used coffee-grounds some fresh boiling water, which 
being strained and boiled next day is then used instead 
of water, so that less coffee will serve. Coffee may be 
cleared in the coffee-pot without straining or filtering, 

* simply by pouring out a cupful and returning it two 
or three times, and then setting the pot in front of the 
fire till the grounds fall to the bottom. This process, 
however, takes more time. A very little cold water 
poured in is said to assist it. The cofiee used ought 
to be newly roasted and ground. To ensure this, many 



BEVERAGES. 163 

people buy tlie roasted beans and grind a sufficient 
quantity for immediate use every morning in a small 
hand-mill. This also protects them from having their 
coffee adulterated with chicory ; a piece of dishonesty 
which is said to have lately so generally prevailed among 
retailers in this country, as actually to_^have vitiated the 
public taste to such an extent that most people now 
prefer the mixture to the pure coffee. 

Chocolate. Mix two ounces of the scraped cake with 
a gill of water in a saucepan, and stir it rapidly over 
the fire until rather thick ; then mix with it gradually 
half a pint of boiling milk, and serve it hot, with sugar 
separate. The Italian method requires a chocolate-pot 
furnished with a muller, the handle of which passess 
through a hole in the lid. In this the scraped cho- 
colate is milled or churned with the milk over the fire 
until very hot and frothy. 

Cocoa. Over a tea-spoonful and a-half of cocoa in a 
cup, pour gradually some boiling milk, stirring the 
cocoa till dissolved. Or it may be first mixed with a 
little water, and then heated with milk in a saucepan 
till it begins to boil. Serve hot with sugar separate. 



Cooling Summer Drinks. — Raspberry Vinegar. Over 
a quart of freshly-gathered raspberries bruised in an 
earthenware basin, pour a pint of vinegar. Cover it 
closely for three days, stirring it once daily, and then 
strain it through a jelly-bag. To each pint of the 
clear liquor add a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil it for 
ten minutes, removing the scum as it rises. When 
cold, bottle, and cork it tightly. A wine-glassful in a 
tumbler of cold water makes a refreshing drink. It 
may also be used with hot water, in which case a little 
sugar may be added. 

Lemonade. Rub off the yellow rind of one lemon 
with a piece of loaf-sugar, and place this along with the'^ 
juice and pulp of three lemons in a deep jug. Pour over 
it a quart of boiling water, and add loaf-sugar to taste. 
When cold, strain it, and it is fit for use. A similar 



164 COOLING DRINKS. 

drink may be made by substitutino- two ounces of cream 
of tartar for the lemon juice. This may also be fla- 
voured with lemon-peel as above. 

Ginger-Beer. In two gallons of water boil for half 
an hour, two ounces of bruised ginger and two pounds 
of loaf-sugai-, removing the scum as it rises. Slice one 
or two lemons into a tub, along with half-an-ounce of 
cream of tartar, and pour the hot liquor over these. 
When nearly cold, add a quarter of a pint of yeast, 
with which let it ferment for four days, or less if the 
weather is warm, closely covered up with a board and 
blankets. Then draw it off from, the lees or sediment 
with a syphon or otherwise, and bottle it in a few days 
after. A little brandy may be added if it is to be kept 
long. The corks should be secured by wires. — A com- 
moner kind may be made with brown sugar, using rather 
less of it, and omitting the lemons. A kind of extem- 
pore ginger beer may be made as follows : — Rub to- 
gether in a mortar half a pound of pounded loaf-sugar, 
two ounces of carbonate of soda, and half an ounce of 
ground ginger. Dissolve a teaspoonful of this mixture 
in a tumbler of water, stir in quickly half a teaspoon- 
ful of powdered tartaric or citric acid, and drink it 
while effervescing. The acid may be mixed with the 
other ingredients in the proportion of an ounce and a 
quarter to the above quantity. They must however be 
previously thoroughly dried, and the mixture kept in a 
stoppered bottle, as the least moisture will in a short 
time deprive it of its property of effervescing. By 
omitting the ginger, and using a little more citric acid, 
the above mixture will form an agreeable effervescing 
Lemonade. 

Spruce Beer is made and fermented like the above, 
substituting six ounces of essence of spruce for the 
ginger, and omitting the lemons and cream of tartar. 
Brown Spruce Beer is made with treacle instead of sugar. 

Treacle Beer is made by boiling for twenty minutes 
in three gallons of water a pound and a half of treacle, 
and half an ounce of hops, to which a little ginger may 



•HOME-MADE WINES. 165 

be added tied in a piece of rag. This decoction is then 
fermented as directed for ginger beer (see p. 164.) 

HOME-MADE WINES.— These are mostly made 
from the ripe native fruits of this country. The gene- 
ral plan for all is the same as that indicated in the re- 
ceipt given on p. 167. The process by which they are 
produced is called fermentatmi. It is a curious chemi- 
cal transformation of the sugar contained naturally in 
the juice, or added to it, into alcohol and carbonic acid. 
This change is the first step towards decay which all 
vegetable and animal liquids containing sugai^ under- 
go. It will not take place below a certain temperature 
(somewhere about 35% the most favourable being from 
40o to 86^), nor unless some vegetable or animal matter 
which is just beginning to decay be present; and hence 
exposure to the air, as promoting this decay, is also ne- 
cessary. Once begun, however, the process goes on, 
slowly even if the air be excluded, until nearly all the 
sugar has disappeared. As this is not always desirable, 
however, the process is generally checked so that the 
wine may be more or less sweet or strong. For this 
purpose, exposing it to cold in a cellar, keeping the air 
excluded, racking it (that is, removing it from the sedi- 
ment and scum, which both contain some of the ferment 
or decaying vegetable matter), and putting it into a clean 
cask impregnated with sulphurous acid by burning brim- 
stone matches in it, are the different methods generally 
employed, either singly or in combination. It is by 
different modifications of these modes of checking or 
promoting the fermentation, and regulating the pro- 
portion of sugar employed, that various kinds of wine 
may be made from the same fruit. 

Thus for a strong dri/ wine, the change should be 
rendered as complete as possible, by continuing the 
process in an open vat or tub for at least three or four 
days, and then putting it into a cask sufficiently large 
to prevent the scum overflowing at the bunghole, as this 
scum favours the continuance of the process which pro- 



166 GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 

duces it. It may also be frequently stirred, or the cask 
shaken, which also promotes the fermentation. Nearly 
the whole of the sugar will in this way be changed, 
and a strong but not very sweet wine be the result. 

To produce a rich sweet wine, besides adding a larger 
proportion of sugar to the fruit juice, the fermentation 
must be stopped before it has gone so far as in the pre- 
ceding case, by allowing it to remain a much shorter 
time in the open tub, and when removed into the cask, 
keeping this always filled and stopped so as to exclude 
the air. For the same purpose, brimstone matches are 
sometimes previously burnt inside the cask, the sul- 
phurous acid thereby produced having the effect of 
checking the fermentation. It is also once or twice 
" racked," and put into a clean cask. This " racking" 
is done through a small hole bored for the purpose near 
the lower side of the cask. 

Effervescing wine is exposed to the air for a still 
shorter time while fermenting, but less sugar is used. 
When in the cask, it is kept in a cool place, carefully 
protected from the air as above, and the bung is closely 
fastened up as soon as the fermentation becomes so 
languid that this can be done without danger of burst- 
ing the cask. Unripe fruits are best adapted for this 
kind of wine. 

Wine may remain in the cask from six weeks to two 
months, or longer, according to the weather, by which 
time it will become clear and may be bottled, which 
should be done in dry cold weather. 

After the fermentation has subsided and the wine 
become clear, the air should be excluded from it as 
much as possible, else it will undergo another change, 
and become converted into vinegar. The fermentation 
of wines, especially the thick sweet sort, is more easily 
effected if a large quantity be made. It is hardly pos- 
sible to succeed perfectly with less than two gallons at 
one time. All the utensils employed, especially the 
casks and tubs, should be scrupulously clean, else they 
will communicate a bad flavour to the wine. Tbe fol- 



HOME-MADE WINES. 167 

lowing receipt may be taken as an example of wine- 
making — subject, of course, to the preceding remarks : — 
Red-Currant Wine. Bruise the fruit in a tub with 
the hand, mix it with an equal measure of water, and 
allow it to stand thus for a night. It is then strained 
through a sieve or canvas bag, squeezing the husks as 
dry as possible To each gallon of liquid add about 
three pounds of sugar, stir it occasionally till dissolved, 
and let it stand in a tub or vat covered with a board 
and blankets in a moderately warm room for two or 
three days, when it will be covered with a frothy scum. 
This scum is removed with a perforated skimmer, and 
the wine, now tolerably clear, drawn off from the 
sediment by a hole bored in the side of the vat near 
the bottom, into a clean cask, which should be quite 
filled with it. If the wine is drawn off by means of a 
syphon instead of tapping the vat, it need not be 
skimmed, as the short end of the syphon being im- 
mersed beneath the scum nearly to the top of the 
sediment, will draw off the liquid free from both these 
impurities. The cask must now be kept in a cool 
place, with the bung-hole open, or closed merely with 
a tile laid over it, till the fermentation ceases, keeping 
it always filled to the bung by adding occasionally, as 
its contents diminish, some of the liquor reserved for 
that purpose. In a month or six weeks the fermen- 
tation will have subsided, when the wine, being now 
clear, will be ready for use, and may be bottled. It is 
generally safer, however, to " rack" it into a fresh 
" sulphured" cask, which must be kept tightly bunged 
till the ensuing spring, when it may be bottled with- 
out fear of the fermentation recommencing. If it is 
then not perfectly clear, it may be " fined" with isin- 
glass or white of egg, — these being dissolved in a small 
quantity of the wine, and this thoroughly mixed with 
the whole, which after standing undisturbed for ten 
days, may be racked off or bottled quite clear. One 
egg or an equal quantity of a solution of isinglass of 
the same consistence is enough for five gallons. Spirit 



168 ■ HOME-MADE WINES. 

(brandy or whisky) are generally added, in a propor- 
tion varying from a pint upwards, for every nine 
,2:allons. It is put into the cask shortly before the 
fermentation ceases. It assists in stopping the fermen- 
tation, but will not, as is erroneously believed, prevent 
the wine becoming sour if exposed to the air, as it is 
from the s^oirit that the acetic acid of sour wine is 
formed. Spirits are therefore by no means indispens- 
able ; the wine if properly made will become quite strong 
enough with the alcohol generated during its fermen- 
tation. Wine is frequently flavoured with spices, such 
as cloves, cinnamon, &c., which are for this purpose 
wrapped in a piece of rag and suspended in the wine 
from the bung-hole during the last stage of fermen- 
tation, and withdrawn as soon as the desired degree of 
flavour has been imparted. In wines made from stone- 
fruit, the kernels may be used in the same way. Cream 
of tartar, or crude tartar, is sometimes employed to 
promote the fermentation. Red-coloured wines generally 
require a longer time to ferment than white wines. 

For Elderberry, Parsnip, Ginger, Birch (made from 
the sap of the birch-tree with raisins), and some other 
wines, the liquor is extracted by boiling ; and as this 
stops for a long time its natural tendency to ferment, 
a little yeast may be employed to begin the process. 
The usual method is to spread the yeast on a piece of 
toasted bread, and put it into the liquor. 



Mulled Wine consists of wine heated with spices, as 
cinnamon, grated nutmeg, cloves, &c. When it reaches 
the boiling point, the spices are removed, and the wine 
served hot along with toast or rusks. Elderberry wine 
treated thus is a favourite winter-evening drink. 

Posset consists of hot wine added to custard (see 
page 107), the Avhole being well mixed by pouring it 
alternately from one vessel to another. It is generally 
made with canary or sack wine, and called Sack Posset. 

Het (hot) Pint. This Scotch '' Hogmanay " beverage 
consists of hot ale, beaten eggs, and whisky, seasoned 



DIET FOR INVALIDS. 169 

with sugar and grated nutmeg. The sugar and eggs 
are mixed with a little cold ale, the hot ale is then 
poured over this, and the whole mixed as in making 
custard. It is again heated till nearly boiling, when 
the whisky and nutmeg are added. 



Drinks and Diet for Invalids. — Toast and Water. 
Toast a crusty slice of bread slowly till quite hard and 
dry, and of a deep chocolate colour, but by no means 
burnt. Place it in a deep jug, pour over it two pints of 
boiling water, and cover it up till cold. Then strain 
it clear from the toast, which if left in it would in a 
short time induce fermentation. 

Barley Water. In half a gallon of water, boil till 
tender two ounces of pearl-barley, along with a season- 
ing of lemon-peel and cinnamon, and a little sugar. 
Skim, and strain it through a hair-sieve, and when cold 
it is ready for use. A little lemon or orange-juice may 
be added. Rice Water is made in the same way. 

Apple Watei' is made by pouring boiling water over 
sliced apples in a jug, which must be covered up till 
cold. It is then strained and sweetened to taste with 
honey or sugar. Or, the sliced apples may be boiled, 
taking care that they do not dissolve. When prepared 
in this way, a few figs cut in half may be added : they 
not only sweeten the drink, but impart a fruity rich- 
ness to it. A similar beverage may be made by boiling 
Prunes. The boiled fruit sweetened with sugar is very 
good to eat. 

Acid drink from Ripe Fruit is made simply by drain- 
ing the juice from any kind of juicy fruit, such as 
strawberries, rasps, currants, &c., and mixing it to taste 
with water and sugar, to which lemon -juice may be 
added if additional tartness is required. 

Wine Whey is made by mixing with hot milk as 
much sherry or other wine as will curdle it, and pour- 
ing off the whey when the curd sinks, which it does 
after standing a few minutes. Sweeten it to taste, and 
dilute it with hot water to the strength required. 



170 DIET FOR INVALIDS. 

Treacle Whey (excellent for promoting perspiration) is 
made in the same manner, but requires no sweetening 
or hot water. 

Gruel. Mix a teacupful of fine oatmeal with a small 
quantity of cold water in a basin. Pour this water off 
into another basin, and repeat the process until about 
a quart has been used, and all the finer part of the 
meal has been extracted. Strain this into a saucepan, 
and boil it for twenty minutes, stirring it continually. 
It may then be seasoned according to taste, either with 
salt or sugar, a little lemon-juice or other acid being 
added with the sugar if desired. 

Caudle consists of sweet gruel, flavoured with wine, 
lemon-juice, and nutmeg or other spice. It may also be 
made by boiling ground rice or wheat flour with small 
beer or milk. 

Rice Milk. In a pint of milk simmer till tender, or 
reduced to a pulp if desired, a tablespoonful of well- 
washed rice ; season with sugar and a very little salt. 
A little butter, and some mild spice, may also be stirred 
into it if approved. 

Sago Milk. After the sago has been soaked in water 
for an hour, proceed exactly as for rice milk. Sago Gruel 
is made in the same way, but with water instead of 
milk. A little wine may be added. 

Vermicelli, Semolina, and Tapioca Milks, are pre- 
pared by throwing a tablespoonful or less of either into 
a pint of boiling milk, and simmering till sufliciently 
tender. The seasonings are the same as for rice milk. 

Macaroni and Milk. Throw the macaroni into plenty 
of boiling water salted, and boil it till tender. Then 
pour off the water and add some milk ; bring this to 
the boil, and season with sugar and a pinch of salt. 

Arrowroot. Mix about two teaspoonfuls of arrow- 
root with a little cold water, and pour over this a pint 
of boiling milk. Boil it over the fire for a few minutes, 
stirring constantly ; season with sugar and a pinch of 
salt. It may be made with water, in which case a little 
wine and lemon-juice and butter may be added if de- 



DIET FOR INVALIDS. 171 

sired. This may also be made into a jelly by allowing 
it to cool in a mould and turning it out (see p. 144). 
^^' Panada or Breadherry. Crumble a stale penny roll 
into a small saucepan, just cover it with water, and 
stir it over the fire while it boils for five minutes. 
Season with sugar and a very little salt, and thin it as 
required with milk or water. The beaten yolk of an 
Qgg and a small piece of butter may be used in it, and 
a little spirits or wine, and nutmeg, are also sometimes 
employed. Panada may be made with weak broth or 
small beer instead of water ; in the former case the 
sugar is of course omitted. 

Stewed. Prunes. The very small and damaged ones 
being rejected, the prunes are stewed for half an hour 
with a little water in a jar placed in boiling water. 
They may be sweetened with sugar ; cinnamon, lemon- 
peel, and a little wine, are also sometimes added. 

Beef Tea. See page 82, — or instead of mincing the 
meat it may be cut into very thin small slices, and 
slowly heated in water till boiling. All fat and scum 
should be skimmed off ; rice may be boiled in it. 

Mutton, Veal, and Chicken Broths should be made 
strictly according to the General Directions for Soups 
on page 82. The fat should be carefully skimmed off", 
and the seasoning not too strong. Rice may be used 
in them, and if permitted, a little onion and parsley; 
but all these ought to be thoroughly cooked. The 
chicken broth may be made as a stew-soup (see p. 92). 



Diet for the Nursery. In this may be included the 
broths and farinaceous preparations with milk, already 
described as diet for invalids ; to which we may add 
the following more substantial articles : — 

Bread and Milk. Cut two or three ounces of stale 
bread into small dice, and pour over this in a basin a 
quantity of boiling milk sufficient to cover it ; cover 
the basin till sufficiently cool, and sweeten with sugar. 

Oatmeal Porridge. Into some water boiling in a 
saucepan throw a little salt, and then pour gradually 



172 DIET FOR THE NURSERY. 

into it frorn the hand a sufficient quantity of coarse 
oatmeal to make it of the desired thickness, rapidly 
stirring it all the time with a porridge-stick or thevil, 
to prevent its burning or forming knots. When boiled 
enough, it is poured into a plate or saucer and allowed 
to cool a little. It is eaten with either new milk or 
buttermilk, which are the best for children. Treacle, 
sugar, cream or butter, are also sometimes taken with 
it instead of milk. With porter or beer and sugar, it 
is a favourite supper with many adults. Porridge may 
be made with milk or a mixture of milk and water, in 
which case less oatmeal will be required. If boiled till 
very smooth, it is said to be more wholesome than when 
less boiled. The roughness of this latter, which is pre- 
ferred by some people, may be partially communicated 
to the former by rapidly stirring in a handful of raw 
meal immediately on removing it from the fire. 

Barley-meal Porridge. The requisite quantity of 
meal should be mixed smoothly with cold water first, 
and then boiled, throwing in the necessary quantity of 
salt. It is eaten with the same accompaniment as oat- 
meal porridge. , It may also be made with milk instead 
of water. A similar preparation of wheat flour and 
milk is called Hasty Fudding. 

Pease-meal Brose is made by pouring boiling water 
sufficiently salted upon ^'■Glasgow Brose-meaV in a basin, 
and stirring it rapidly so as to form a thick smooth 
paste. It is eaten with milk or buttermilk. This, from 
its cheapness, is a good deal used by many of the poor 
in Scotland. Oatmeal Brose is made in the same way, 
but should not be stirred, being allowed to stand a few 
minutes, and then merely cut across several times with 
a spoon so as to form knots. In Kail Brose the liquor 
in which salt-beef and greens have been boiled is used 
instead of water, — the fatter the better. These, how- 
ever, from the rawness of the oatmeal, are hardly pro- 
per for children. 

Pap for Infants may be made with thin slices of stale 
bread toasted till quite dry and pale brown, — but rusks 



DIET FOR THE NURSERY. 173 

are better. Break these in small pieces into a small 
saucepan, just cover them with water, and make them 
hot without boiling. Pour off most of the water, add 
a little brown sugar, and then mash the whole to a pulp. 
French Pap is a kind of very thin hasty pudding (see 
Barleymeal Porridge, p. 172) sweetened with sugar. The 
flour for this, however, is better prepared as follows : — 
Press it closely into a gallipot, cover the mouth of this 
with a stiff flour-and-water paste, over which tie firmly 
a piece of linen rag, and thus boil it for three or four 
hours. Having been already cooked in this way_, the 
flour only requires to be heated with milk and water. 
This forms a much better food for young infants than 
that in which the milk has been boiled and thus ren- 
dered less digestible. 

Meat, &c. It is of the greatest importance to child- 
ren that their meat should be wholesomely cooked. For 
this purpose the " General Directions " given in the 
chapters treating of the different processes, ought to be 
faithfully followed. With the exception of salt, much 
less seasoning is required than for the food of adults, — 
mustard, pepper, and such-like stimulants being not 
only unnecessary, but generally distasteful. With the 
meat^they ought to have the usual vegetable acccompani- 
ments, but with a larger proportion of the farinaceous 
kinds, such as rice, macaroni, &c. Children ought not 
to commence a solid meat diet under three years of age, 
and then the meat ought to bear a very small propor- 
tion to the rest of their food, gradually increasing as 
they grow older. Simple broth with rice in it they 
may get much earlier. As variety of food is good for 
them as well as for grown people, they should oc- 
casionally have light farinaceous puddings, and a small 
proportion of ripe fruit in its season. If cookecis fruit 
is much better for them stewed, and eaten with rice, 
than in the form of pastry, which often, as many know 
to their cost, disagrees with them from its comparative 
indigestibility. A favourite and wholesome dish of fruit 
for children is called —

Gooseherry-fool. This consists of unripe green goose- 
berries, stewed with very little water till quite soft but 
not burst, in an earthen jar placed in a pot of boiling 
water, — then drained and mashed to a pulp. This when 
cold is sweetened with brown sugar, and served with a 
little milk mixed with it in a hash-dish.

REMARKS ON DINNERS, &c. 

Dinners. — The provision for each day's dinner, so as 
to combine economy with variety, is not the least im- 
portant part of a housewife's duties. In a small family 
where no very extensive cooking is required, it is often 
a matter of some little difficulty to practise this com- 
bination. For roasting and boiling it is most economi- 
cal to purchase the best pieces of meat : though perhaps 
a little higher priced, they will go further, and other- 
wise give more satisfaction. Such pieces are of course 
much too large to be consumed in one day by three or 
four persons, and therefore variety upon succeeding 
days must be sought in a different mode of cooking the 
remainder. Thus part of the remains of one day's 
roast may be prepared as English stew for the second 
day ; more of it as a hash or ragout for the third ; and 
for the fourth a French salad may be made if sufficient 
be left ; or if not, the bones may be grilled as a devil 
for supper ; after which these bones Avill still be useful 
for soup. In the same way a piece of boiled meat may 
also be all used up without waste, the liquor being on 
the second day made into a clear soup, which may after- 
wards be rewarmed with additional vegetables as a puree 
soup. Pease soup will keep for a week, and be improved 
by it. In summer, cold meat occasionally, either plain 
with pickles, or dressed as a salad, will be found more 
agreeable than hot meat every day. The cheaper parts 
of meat, though inferior for roasting or boiling, furnish 



REMARKS ON DINNERS. 175 

excellent stews. A maigre dinner once or twice a-week, 
consisting either of fish, or of soup and some kind of 
pudding, is both economical and healthful. The fre- 
quencyof such, however, must be regulated by the habits 
of the diners, — those engaged in sedentary in-door occu- 
pations being generally understood to require a larger 
proportion of animal food than others. 

The arrangement of dishes upon the table is a matter 
of taste and convenience. The principal ones should be 
placed at the head and foot, to be dispensed by the 
master and mistress of the house ; and the others, con- 
sisting of vegetables &c., arranged on the table sym- 
metrically. The heavy work of carving ought certainly 
to be allotted to the master, although this is not always 
the custom. Before serving the dinner, the housewife 
should see that the table is furnished with its proper 
complement of knives and forks, napkins, glasses, bread, 
water, condiments, &c., as calling for these things after- 
wards unpleasantly interrupts the order of dinner. 

The number of courses will depend in some measure 
upon the number dining and the " style " maintained 
in the house. The usual order of serving is — \st, Fish 
and Soup, which are " removed " by the larger roasts 
and boiled meats (hence called "Removes") and their 
appropriate vegetables ; filling up the table, if the com- 
pany be large, with side dishes of smaller rousts of 
poultry ifec, and a few made dishes ; — 2c?, Puddings and 
sweet fancy dishes of various kinds, jellies, tarts, and 
pies. At this stage also small game birds are intro- 
duced. Lastly comes the Dessert, consisting of ripe, 
preserved, and dried fruits, cake, &c. Before removing 
the cloth for dessert, cheese, with bread and biscuit, 
may be served along with port or strong ale. This is 
an old Scotch custom, now however generally going out 
of fashion. All this is of course adapted for a large 
party. For three or four persons a selection from the 
above will be all that is requisite. — N. B. Hot plates 
should be provided for all hot meats. 

The order of service above described is not altogether 



176 REMARKS ON DINNERS. 

a mere regulation of fashion cr caprice. There is 
a good reason for it in the qualities of the food. 
The fish and soup being slightly stimulating, prepare 
the stomach for the more substantial and cloying 
roasts &c., after which the fruits and sweets come 
as a grateful relief to the palate. 

Suppers. — This meal should be light as compared 
with dinner, and therefore large hot roasts &c. are of 
course inappropriate. Where hot dishes are required, 
the best are tripe, or poultry, with potatoes, — broiled 
fish, devils, well- seasoned ragouts, hashes, fricassees, &c. 
Cold meats are however most generally preferred ; — 
roasts (left at dinner, if not too much cut up), meat 
pies, salads, cold fowls with ham or tongue, potted 
head, oysters, &;c. These may be followed as at dinner 
by sweets, such as jeUies, tarts, custards, fruit pies, &c., 
after which may come a dessert similar to that served 
at dinner. 

Of course, with regard to both dinners and suppers, 
good taste will dictate that the extent of the service 
should be so proportioned to the number of the company 
that there may be enough, without unnecessary profusion. 
Decorations, consisting of either real or imitation fruits 
or other eatables, not to he eaten, are symptoms of vul- 
garity not to be tolerated. A vase of flowers in the 
centre of the table is, however, an admissible and 
pleasing ornament. 



Here, having concluded all we have to say on the 
choice and preparation of food, we are much disposed 
to pause, and say to our readers with at least as much 
sincerity as the Thane of old did to his guests, " May 
good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both ;" 
but the custom of cookery-books compels us to 
say a few words on the art of carving, and on the periods 
of the year in which the various viands will be found 
in greatest perfection. 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 177 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 

Observation and practice only can confer facility in 
carving, written directions being inadequate to convey 
more than a general idea of the most artistic mode. 
As a general rule, butcher-meat should not be cut across 
the grain (especially if it is to reappear at table cold), 
as this at once lets out the gravy, which is better i?i the 
meat. Slices of Beef, Veal, Ham, Tongue, and Fowl, 
should be cut thin, and if a slanting direction be taken 
they will in general be larger. Mutton, Lamb, and 
Pork may be carved in thicker slices. A sharp knife 
is essential to comfort and neatness in carving. A 
small piece of fat and a spoonful of gravy should be 
helped with each slice, and also some stuffing, where 
that is used. 

Sirloin of Beef. The under-side should be cut in slices 
across ; — it is best when hot. The " upper side" is cut 
longitudinally from the back-bone towards the ends of 
the ribs. If it is likely to be all eaten while hot, begin 
by making a deep cut across the thick end close to the 
back-bone, which will facilitate the separation of the 
slices ; otherwise, the fewer incisions made in it the 
better. A little of the under-side fat may be helped 
with each slice. The Ribs of Beef should be carved in 
the same manner. 

Round of Beef. After removing an outside slice 
half an inch thick, carve the beef in thin horizontal 
slices, with a little of the fat to each. The Aitch-bone 
may be carved in the same way. 

A Heart should be cut from the open end to the point. 
The Loin or Breast, and Fillet of Veal, are carved 
similarly to the sirloin and round of beef 

Leg of Mutton. Cut it across, on the iDside of the 
thigh near the small end. When this part is finished, 
slices may be cut from the larger end in a direction 
perpendicular to the first cut. In a roast, the shank 
end ought to have a fringed paper covering to keep 

N 



178 DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 

the carver's hand clean when laying hold of it to. steady 
the joint or turn it. 

Shoulder oj Mutton. Slices are first cut from the 
hollow part near the knuckle end, in a direction across 
the bone. Another set of thin slices may afterwards 
be cut from above the blade-bone, parallel to its ridge. 
The Saddle of mutton is best carved by dividing the 
meat from the back-bone by passing the knife between 
them, and then cutting the slices in the same direction 
as in cutting chops. 

Venison. Generally in the same way as mutton. 

Fore Quarter of Lamb. First detach the shoulder 
by cutting in a circular direction beneath it, beginning 
at the joint and keeping the point of the knife towards 
the centre ; the brisket {i. e. the gristly ends of the 
ribs) is then cut off by a cut across the whole. It is 
then ready for helping among the company, giving each 
person a rib or two at a time cut like a chop, with a 
piece of the brisket cut in the same direction. The 
Shoulder is carved like a shoulder of mutton. 

The Hind Quarter of Lamb is carved like the leg of 
mutton, only a chop from the loin-part may be helped 
along with each slice from the leg. 

[The back-bone in necks and loins of mutton and 
lamb, or indeed in any part except the saddle, ought 
to be divided at the joints before cooking, which will 
greatly facilitate the operations of the carver.] 

Pork is generally carved like mutton. The skin be- 
fore roasting should be scored so as to mark off the 
slices. In Roast Pig, the shoulders and hind-legs are 
first removed, and then the intermediate parts cut 
across into conveniently sized pieces. 

Ham. Begin with an incision down to the bone, 
about the middle, and on either side of this cut slices 
as thin as possible. 

Tongue. Cut it through obliquely about the middle, 
and then cut thin slices parallel to the first cut. 

Fou'l. Hold it firmly with the fork thrust into the 
breast, from which, if large, cut a few slices ; then take 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 17^ 

off the left wing, cutting downwards, along with a small 
portion of the flesh of the breast attached. Then sever 
the leg on the same side, cutting in the same direction. 
The limbs of the other side are next separated in the 
same manner. After this, remove the merrythought 
and the neck-bones ; divide the breast from the back, 
either bj tearing them assunder or by cutting through 
the ribs downwards to the tail. Now turn the back, 
outside upwards, and break it in two by fixing the 
knife firmly in the middle, and bending the rump 
upwards with the fork. The side-bones are then cut 
from the rump-half, and the operation is completed. 
To facilitate the separation of the joints of poultry 
when large or tough, there are peculiar modes of 
twisting the limbs with the fork, which can hardly be 
described, but must be seen and practised to be under- 
stood and learned. The skill required for this, how- 
ever, may now be said to be almost superseded by an 
invention of M. Soyer's, which consists in a mode of 
cutting the sinews before cooking, by means of an in- 
strument called a " Tendon Separator," which not only 
saves trouble to the carver, but makes the bird look 
plumper when cooked, by obviating the effect of the 
contraction of the sinews by the heat. 

Turkey. Cut off the apron or skin of the belly so 
as to get at the stuffing, and then proceed generally in 
the same manner as with fowl, except that a number 
of thin slices should first be cut lengthways from the 
breast. Less meat from the body is required with the 
wing, as this is larger. 

Goose or Duck. After removing the apron and carv- 
ing the breast in thin longitudinal slices, remove the 
leg as follows : — Turn the bird over on its side, insert 
the fork into the small end of the leg-bone, and press 
it close to the side, at the same time entering the knife 
above the thigh-joint, which will then rise up, and the 
leg may be separated by a cut in the direction of the 
tail. The wing is now removed by a similar process, 
the joint being started by pressing down the small end 



180 ARTICLES IN SEASON. 

of the pinion. The dissection is then completed as di- 
rected for fowl. 

Pigeons are simply cut in two from head to tail. 

Wild Fowl and Game should furnish slices from the 
breastj which is generally esteemed the most delicate 
part. Small birds may be carved like pigeons. 

Hare or Babbit. After cutting open the apron to 
disclose the stuffing, remove the shoulders by a circular 
cut, and then the hind legs. Cut a slice off each side 
the whole length, at a little distance from the backbone. 
Divide the back across into three or four parts. The 
head is divided by first removing the lower jaw, and 
then cutting the upper part in two lengthways. 

Fish needs no carving, but should be neatly divided 
with a fish slice at the natural separations between the 
flakes, so as not to mangle these. The roes and other 
" fancied " parts should be fairly distributed along with 
the slices from the body. Fried fish is generally sent 
to table in pieces small enough for helping. 

In " helping " what he carves, the carver ought to 
give each person a moderate supply at a time, — and not 
heap his plate with a dis-appetizing profusion. The 
strictest impartiality should regulate his distribution of 
the prime parts : to " deal small and serve all" should be 
his maxim. Among these favourite delicacies are — 

The fat of venison, — the " pope's eye " in a leg and 
mutton, — the kidneys of veal and lamb, — the neck and 
ribs of roast pig, — the breast and wings of poultry and 
wild fowl, — the thighs of goose and duck, — the legs of 
duck, — the legs of hare and rabbit, — the jelly and 
tongue of cod's head, — turbot's fins, — the thin part of 
salmon, — the thick of flat fish generally, &c. 

ARTICLES IN SEASON. 

" thou Nature ! thou divine goddess ! how thyself 
thou blazon'st in these two princely boys." Had Shake- 
speare been writing a cookery book instead of a play, 
he would equally have eulogized Nature for the admir-

able distribution she has made of her treasures through- 
out the different periods of the year^ so as to suit no^ 
only the real wants but the tastes of man, varying as 
both these do with the ever changeful seasons. Thus 
during the cold of Winter, when that internal furnace 
of which Liebig speaks as the source of warmth to the 
animal economy, requires the most abundant and sub- 
stantial supplies of fuel, she has placed at man's disposal 
in their highest perfection, her fat beef, mutton, and 
pork, her substantial geese and turkeys, her best and 
most nutritious fish, and her hardiest and most solid 
vegetables. In Spring she invites him to purify his blood 
with her more esculent vegetable productions, and to 
vary his supplies of animal food by the use of lamb, 
young fowls, and fresh-water fish. To alleviate the 
parching heat of Summer, and to induce him to mode- 
rate his demands on more solid viands, she now offers 
her copious supplies of small fruit, of young potatoes, 
of tender peas, and of sweet turnips, — of fish now re- 
novated from the exhaustion attendant on the spawning 
season, — of a variety of small birds, and of the young 
of the larger fowls. Her " bounty shines in Autumn 
unconfined, and spreads a common feast for all that 
lives." Then are gathered those stores of farinaceous 
food on which the mass of mankind chiefly depend for 
sustenance throughout the year — the larger sorts of 
fruit, as well for present use as to serve during the win- 
ter — together with contributions from the produce of 
warmer climates than our own ; — many varieties of 
game and shell-fish are also in perfection, and towards 
its close the larger animals are ready to provide us 
again with our winter fare. 

The subjoined table shows concisely the distribution 
of the animal supply. T\\q fruits and vegetables will in 
general be found in best condition when they are most 
abundant in the markets, but as these periods vary with 
the backwardness or forwardness of the season, any ac- 
curate classification of them under particular months is 
next to impossible.

APPENDIX. 



MAXIMS ON EATING. 

1. The stomach should never be filled to such an extent as 
to cause any sensation of uneasy fulness. 

2. Eating should always be sufficiently slow to admit of 
thorough mastication of the food. 

3. Much fluid should not be taken with solid food, it being 
better to drink freely between the meals. 

4. Neither the mind nor the body should be actively exer- 
cised very soon after a full meal. 



REMEDIES FOR INDIGESTION. 

Dr. BuDD, in a recent lecture on disorders of the stomach, 
recommends from half a grain to a grain of ipecacuanha in a 
pill, or a grain of cayenne pepper, with three or four grains of 
rhubarb, as the medicine most effectual in removing the un - 
easiness and sense of oppression sometimes felt after meals, and 
the various other evils that result from slow digestion. The 
best time to take such remedies is just before the meal after 
which uneasiness is felt. 



EFFECTS OF SPIRITS AND ALCOHOLIC DRINKS. 

Professor Johnston observes, — 1. That though they contain 
none of the common forms of nutritive matter, yet they supply 
a portion of the carbonic acid and watery vapour which are 
constantly being given off" by the lungs, and so far supply the 
place of food— of the starch and fat, for example, which we 
usually eat. 2. They diminish (as tea and coffee also do) the 
absolute amount of matter usually given off" by the lungs and 
kidneys, and thus have the property of making a given quantity 
of food go further in sustaining the strength and bulk of the 
body. Hence (he says) fermented liquors, if otherwise suitable 
to the constitution, exercise a beneficial influence upon old 
people, and other weakly persons in whom the process of 
digestion does not replace the tissues so fast as they naturally 
waste. Weak alcoholic drinks also gently stimulate the diges- 



184 APPENDIX. 

tive organs, and help them to do their work more fully ; and 
thus the body is sustained to a later period in life. These good 
results, however (he cautions his readers), follow only from a 
moderate use of them, and in no way justify indulgence in them 
to excess, or palliate the moral evils to which this excess inva- 
riably gives rise. 

On this subject Spencer Wells observes, that though the 
stimulus of wine may to a certain extent assist digestion, yet 
there is a danger of more food being thus digested than the 
system requires, in which case an unhealthy state of repletion 
ensues. 



COMPARATIVE ANALYSES OP VARIOUS ARTICLES OF FOOD. 

Chemists have found that nearly everything used as food, 
both animal and vegetable, is a mixture mainly of two Prin- 
ciples : — (1st), The Nutritive Principle, considered so because 
it is believed to contribute most to sustain the muscular 
strength; its ultimate elements being in every case nearly 
identical with those of flesh, and chiefly distinguished by in- 
cluding a large proportion of the gas called nitrogen. (2d), 
The Carbonaceous Principle, so called from its containing 
chiefly carbon or charcoal, combined with the elements of 
water, viz. hydrogen and oxygen gases. The use of this prin- 
ciple seems to be to maintain the heat of the body by slowly 
burning, or chemically combining, with the oxygen of the air 
which the blood absorbs during its circulation through the 
lungs. Both these principles exist in many forms ; — thus in 
animal substances the first is found in the shape of Casein 
(the curd or cheese of milk), and of Albumen and Fibrin, which 
have been already described in Chapter IV., p. 19 : in vegetable 
substances it is most abundant as insoluble Gluten in every 
variety of corn, and more sparingly as Casein and Albumen 
dissolved in the juices of plants. The Carbonaceous Principle 
occurs both in vegetable and animal matter as fat and oil, 
and largely in the former as stai'ch, sugar, gum, and also as 
woody fibre which is not quite so digestible. Of these the fats 
and oils are generally the least digestible, although when 
once assimilated in the blood, they all appear to answer the 
same purpose. 

Mixed with these Principles there is generally a larger or 
smaller quantity of water as well as of mineral matter (gene- 
rally Chlorides and Phosphates) which latter goes to give soli- 
dity to the bones. 

With this explanation we now introduce the following table, 
the materials for which have been gathered from Professor 
Johnston's " Chemistrv of Food."

186 APPENDIX. 

The reader will observe in the foregoing Table the great, 
difference which exists between the proportions of the same 
principle in the various articles, whence has arisen the general 
use of a mixed and varied diet in order that these differences 
may be made to counterbalance one another, and a due pro- 
portion in the whole maintained. The best proportion between 
the two principles is believed to be exhibited in milk ; that 
being the only food provided by nature which, by itself, will 
maintain health and strength. It is remarkable too as being 
the only animal food containing sugar, — a circumstance which 
suggests that our diet should contain some admixture of this 
kind of carbonaceous matter as well as fat. 

A remarkable corroboration of this view is found in man's 
instinctive tendency to choose a diet more or less resembling 
milk in its constitution. Thus we generally supply the de- 
ficiency of sugar or starch in butcher-meat by eating along 
with it some farinaceous vegetable such as potatoes ; — to bread, 
fish, cauliflower, and many other articles of food defective in 
fat, we add butter ; — with cheese we take bread to supply the 
carbonaceous principle ; and we balance the excess of fat in 
pork with cabbage and pease pudding. 



The rapidly stimulating property of beef tea, or broth is 
due to a peculiar crystallizable substance contained in the 
juice of meat called kreatine, which is remarkable as being 
almost identical in chemical composition with the stimulating 
principles of tea and coffee ; — hence the name of heef tea is 
perhaps singularly appropriate. These substances exist in very 
minute quantities in their respective sources, yet their action 
is not the less certain or powerful, — producing paralysis if taken 
in too large quantities.

Sdlnbnrffh BTening Posiy, 

OooKERT is everybody's concern. It comes home to the family 
ftnd fire-side comforts of all the sons and daughters of Adam. 
— The author before us, Mr. Reid, has contributed his mite to 
the great treasury of gastronomic science. His volume is small 
but it is stuffed with rich materials, — a condensed magazine of 
receipts, a cyclopaedia of culinary wisdom. We have directions 
in every branch of the art ab ovo usque ad Tncda, 

Tait's Magazine. 

The art of Cookery, as most of us know by no very pleasant 
experience, is one in which the middle and the industrial 
clases of this country are lamentably deficient. From want of 
the necessary knowledge on this subject, two great evils arise. 
In the first place, half the food consumed by working men and 
and their families is more or less spoiled in the cooking ; and, 
in the second place, a large and extravagant proportion is 
nnconsciously wasted and thrown away. Those acquainted 
with the domestic life of the corresponding classes on' the Con- 
tinent, are aware that among the French, the Germans, and 
Italians, a very different economy prevails — that they know 
not only how to make the best of the food for which they 
labour, but also how to make the most of it. Here is a book 
written for the express purpose of putting our own countrymen 
and their wives and housekeepers in possession of the same 
useful knowledge, at a cheap and easy rate. It is not, like the 
thousand and one " Cookery Books'* dished up by the book- 
seller's hacks for the sole purpose of selling, a mere collection 
of worn-out receipts or new-fangled nos^trums, but a little 
manual of sound practical instruction^ teaching, in the most 
intelligible way, the why and the wherefore of the plain rules 
which it enforces. A better book for the piirpose we have net 



OPINIONS OF THB PRESS« 

seen : it is one very much wanted ; and we trust the good sense 
of the {Aiblic will accord to it a wide and welcome reception. 

Olaaffow OltiseB. 

In the little work before us, cookery is elevated to the rank 
of a science. The writer treats of ' the chemical and mechani- 
cal properties of food,*" and of " the requirements of healthy 
nutrition." Although, however, somewhat learned in its prin- 
ciples, and informed throughout with a scientific spirit, it is as 
plain in all its directions to the housewife as A B C. More- 
over, it is distinctly a cookery book " for the million." It even 
condescends to treat of ** oatmeal porridge" and " peasemeal 
brose." To any prudent wife in the middle or in the operative 
ranks, who desired to make home comfortable to her husband, 
and to avoid those everyday growls and quarrels arising out of 
tough beef-steaks, broth that creates loathing, and money wasted 
on messes that can hardly be eaten, a very little study of this 
book would be invaluable. A thousand times more useful, as a 
marriage-gift than the usual gewgaw presents, would be this very 
simple manual for the daily guidance of the youthful bride in 
one of her most important domestic duties. 

The chief distinction of this rational cookery book is, however, 
its continual attention to what is wholesome and digestible. — 
. . . We have read this excellently-written little work with 
interest and attention, and we entertain entire confidence in the 
thorough knowledge and great practical good sense of the 
writer. We believe, farther, that its general circulation among 
Scotch families would have the effect of materially improving 
the dietary, and increasing the substantial happiness of many a 
household, without involving necessarily a sixpence of addi- 
tional expenditure. 

Edinburgh XTews, 

As a text-book to assist all classes in acquiring the knowledge 
of a science so useful, Mr. Beid's work is invaluable. It is the 
very thing wanted. It explains the why and the wherefore of 
every culinary process ; and we may say that the housewife who 
makes herself mistress of the principles it developes, will never 
require to apologise at the table for what she sets upon it. 
We augur for it a useful and extensive circulation. 



POSTSCRIPT. 



Since the following sheets were sent to press, the Author has 
had his attention directed to Professor Johnston's interesting 
and useful Tolume on the " Chemistry of Common Life/' and 
is happy to find in it a full confinnation of the truth of the 
principles set forth in the first edition of this little work, pub- 
lished eight months ago. The Professor gives numerous ana- 
lytical tables of the constituent principles of most of the articles 
used as the food of man, by which it is to be hoped that many 
pr^udices will be dispelled, and many erroneous views be 
corrected. As his accuracy may be fiiUy relied on, a summary 
of these tables is given in an Appendix at page 183 of the 
present volume. If the reader is curious in such matters, he 
will observe with some surprise how nearly the nutritive ele. 
ments contained in the various mixtures of food prepared by 
man, approach to those composing milJs, the only kind of food 
prepared by nature which will alone sustain animal life for any 
considerable time. The instinct or experience of civilized man 
has led him so to conjoin the productions of the vegetable and 
animal kingdom, as in general to effect a tolerable imitation of 
the food of his in&ncy, — infinitely diversified of course in 
structure and flavour, but still, when amalgamated by the skill 
of the cook, well fitted to sustain his strength and to supply 
the waste caused by the tear and wear of daily life. 



In the Appendix will also be foimd some remarks on Alco- 
holic Drinks, — with a few sensible maxims on eating, from 
" Spbkoeb Wells on Gout," and simple remedies for Indigestion, 
by Dr. Bunn.

PREFACE. 



Thb rapid sale of his First Edition has been extremeljr 
gratifying to the Author, more particularly as showing 
that he has succeeded in presenting a most important 
art in a light more in accordance with the spirit of the 
age than that in which it has hitherto been viewed. 
The present time is eminentlj scientific. No branch 
of knowledge or art will interest the student imless it 
has been systemati^d according to some few general 
laws or principles ; and the Author is convinced that it 
is the want of this in Cookery which has occasioned its 
recent comparative neglect, particularly among the 
middle classes. Our grandmothers were content when 
they happened to produce a palatable dish by following 
the directions of some old-fashioned empirical receipt- 
book, and never troubled themselves to distinguish those 
elements in its preparation to which its excellence, in 
common with that of all others of the same class, was 
due. Occasional and uncertain success like this, how- 
ever, seems to have been insufficient to tempt our mo- 
dern young ladies to preside in the kitchen, and cookery- 
books, as generally written, are notoriously defective in 
everjrthing that can interest those educated in the style 
of the present day. Compared with Music and Paint- 
ing, Chemistry and Natural History, and a host of 



Vl rRBFACB. 

other subjects of modern culture, with their beautiful 
laws of harmony and proportion, how dry and uninte- 
resting must be the study of a cook's receipt-book 
where the most famous dish seems but an unmeaning 
jumble of heterogeneous eatables, and the only admitted 
"Proof of the Pudding is in the eating it*M Yet in 
spite of all this it is really astonishing, when such a 
" proof has been found satisfactory, with what eager- 
ness some young ladies will beg for a copy of " that 
receipt," thus showing the interest they naturally — per- 
haps instinctively — take in such matters ; and their dis- 
gust and disappointment may weU be conceived when 
their pudding, though apparently founded on the same 
premised, turns out incapable of the same proof, the 
failure having arisen from the non-performance of some 
manipulation or mode of cooking deemed so unimpor- 
tant, or so generally known or obviously necessary (in 
the cook's opinion) as to render superfluous any men- 
tion of it in the receipt. Can we wonder, then, that in 
such circumstances Household Cookery is so often aban- 
doned to the wasteful mismanagement of a dirty maid- 
of-all-work or of an ignorant " plain cook V* 

To remedy such a state of matters has been the chief 
aim of this work, and the mode in which this has been 
attempted is fully expressed in the two quotations 
which appear in its title-page. The Author has sought 
to impart a rational understanding of every process, so 
that his readers may distinguish its essential pecu- 
liarities from those which merely mark its relation to 
a particular article of food. 

A merely empirical knowledge of specific receipts is 
but the pedantry of cookery, which many modern 
cookery-books seem specially designed to encourage. 



PREFACE. YIl 

On consulting some of them, one might almost sup- 
pose that the precise proportioning of ingredients ai^d 
seasonings was everything, and the process nothing; 
— that there existed some mysterious virtue in certain 
relative quantities, without which every effort of 
cookery must be an utter failure. Now the real fact 
is the very reverse of this. Great latitude may be 
allowed in proportioning ingredients, provided their 
treatment otherwise be correct. Indeed, to insist upon 
exactness in this respect leads, in nine cases out of ten, 
to an unsatisfactory result, which is very possibly the 
secret cause of the general dissatisfaction regarding 
most cookery-receipts. The reason of it will be evident 
when we consider that what pleases one palate offends 
another, and also that the flavour of almost every kind 
of vegetable seasoning varies in strength with the spe- 
cimen employed. But it is otherwise with the processes 
of cookery. These bear relation to the chemical and 
mechanical properties of food, which never vary, and 
to the requirements of nutrition, which are equally un- 
changing. We do not mean to deny the possibility of 
an artistic combination of flavours : all we assert is, 
that for this no exact directions can be given. These 
can only be of the most general kind, such as the fol- 
lowing : — Isty The natural flavour of that which gives 
name to the dish ought always to predominate, — such 
ac^uncts only being selected as will serve to heighten 
this ; 2d, If the principal ingredient be in itself insipid, 
the communicated flavour should be simple and distinct; 
and Sd, A mixture of decidedly different flavours ought 
never to be attempted unless the result be a close imi- 
tation of some other well-known flavour. In this way 
the cook will avoid equivocal mixtures, regarding which 



Vm PREFACB. 

two persons wiih a slight difference in the constitution 
or habit of their organs of taste, might pronounce con- 
tradictory opinions. 

In accordance with the principles laid down in the 
foregoing remarks, the Chapters treating of the dif- 
ferent Processes are prefaced by paragraphs of " Ge- 
neral Directions," in which everything that is essential 
in these processes is particularly described. To these 
paragraphs, and likewise to Chapter IV., the author 
begs particular attention, as they are indispensable to 
a corrept understanding of the receipts which follow 
them. In these also the same principles have ren- 
dered nearly superfluous any statement of exact pro- 
portions; but where such statements are made, they 
are only meant to show what is admissible — ^not to 
prescribe what is indispensable. 

Haying in this way shown that cookery, like all 
other arts, has its general principles founded on the 
natural qualites of the subjects on which it operates, 
the author trusts he has imparted to it an interest 
suited to the enlightened taste of the present time. 
That he has to some extent been successful in this, 
the reception of his first edition has most agreeably 
testified ; and he hopes that the careful revisal which 
the second edition has undergone, together with its 
various additipns and improvements, wiU render it 
fully as acceptable as the former. 

To render the book as nearly perfect as its limits 
will allow, its first three chapters contain remarks on 
household economy, together with a description of the 
various culinary processes, and of the utensils and ap- 
pliances required for each ; and the concluding chap- 
ter embraces a number of miscellaneous receipts which 



PREFACE. IX 

could not well be included in the preyious ones. To 
this there are also appended some remarks on Dinners 
and Suppers, with directions for carving ; and likewise 
an Index of the times at which the various provisions 
are in season. 

The table of Contents is arranged partly by waj of 
Index, to show the page on which the receipt for 
each dish is to be found, and also that containing the 
General Directions for the class to which it belongs, 
which ought to be studied in connection with each par- 
ticular receipt. The contents of Chapters V. to IX. are 
arranged together in a tabular form as being more con- 
cise. It is hoped that the book will thus not onlj be 
rendered useful to those who already possess some ex- 
perience in domestic management, but will also serve 
as an elementary guide-book to young housekeepers ; 
to whom it is most respectfully dedicated, by their 
obedient servant,

INTRODUCTION. 



The Art of Cookery is one of the natural developments 
of Civilization. Viewed in this light it ought not to 
be despised as a mere pander to luxury, for experience 
proves that it is absolutely necessary to the healthful 
existence of the man of sedentary and in-door habits. 
The savage who has daily to fish for his breakfast and 
hunt for his dinner, or the ploughman who labours in 
the fields from dawn till dusk, can, and does, easily 
consume and digest food prepared in a way that would 
soon prove fatal to the equally laborious artizan of 
the workshop, or to the merchant, student, or lawyer, 
whose duties confine them to the counter, the library, 
or the desk. Now, although the cookery of the citizen 
is undoubtedly much superior to that found sufiicient for 
the peasant or the savage, still it is, in this country at 
least, very inferior to what it ought to be ; and hence 
dyspepsia and other derangements of the digestive 
organs are so prevalent. May it not be that these de- 
rangements, becoming hereditary among townspeople, 
contribute largely to increase their infant mortality so 
much beyond that of the peasantry 1 Should it prove 
so, we may say, literally — '* The fathers have eaten sour 
grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge." 

But the evils of bad cookery do not end here. The 
injury done to the physical, infects also the moral na- 
ture, and the victim of indigestion exhibits a fretful 

B 



Z INTRODUCTION. 

dissatisfied ill-humour^ which renders his life a burden 
to himself and a torment to those around him. There 
is hardly a more fruitful or a less suspected source of 
domestic discord than this, which is all the worse that 
it does not exhibit itself in any violent outbursts, but 
gradually produces estrangements resulting in unjust 
and painful suspicions. 

There is yet another evil consequence of bad cookery. 
The oppression of undigested food leads to that habi- 
tual use of stimulating drinks to which so large a part 
of the misery and degradation of this country may be 
be traced. This is a point to which we earnestly call 
the attention of teetotalers. 

That our British cookery has generally been felt to 
be very defective, is strikingly evidenced by the great 
demand which has so long existed for good cookery- 
books, and the consequent success of many of even 
doubtful utility. Nothwithstanding the vast number 
of such works which has been published, it must be ad- 
mitted that a book of truly economical cookery is still a 
desideratum. Hitherto cookery-books have generally 
been little else than long and often ill-arranged lists of 
receipts for expensive dishes, requiring for their prepa- 
ration many curious and costly utensils. To the artizan 
these are of course useless, while to many of the middle 
class they are worse, as the attempt to keep a genteel 
table by following their directions is sure to entail a 
ruinous expense. But it is not solely the costliness of 
the prescriptions of the authors of these works that is 
objectionable. They are often curiously learned in the 
pleasures of the eye and the palate, and yet lamentably 
ignorant of the requirements of the stomach. Their 
stimulating seaonings excite an artificial appetite which 



INTRODUCTION. 3 

tempts the incautious eater to indulge to excess in what, 
even if partaken of moderately, would prove injurious. 

It has been said that a Frenchman can cook a pair 
of old boots into a first-rate dinner. Now though we 
do not profess to enable our readers to accomplish this 
particular feat, still we hope to show them what care- 
ful cooking can accomplish with materials which many 
would consider nearly worthless. The fact is, that the 
old-boots proverb is merely another way of stating that 
the French are in the habit of living well upon food 
which, cooked after our rude British fashion, would 
be absolutely uneatable. They can convert what we 
should consider bad meat and vegetables into nutritious 
and palatable food. Why should not we endeavour to 
make our good materials at least as eatable as the 
Frenchman's bad « ones, instead of, as is too frequently 
the case, rendering them both tasteless and indigestible 
through ignorance of the first principles of cookery % 

The main object of the present work is to show the 
economically disposed housewife how she may at a 
small expense provide her husband and family with a 
good dinner, which shall be at once wholesome and 
palatable because properly cooked, and, for the same 
reason, cheap. It is proposed to do this not merely by 
giving approved receipts for plain dishes, but especially 
by directing attention to those General Principles 
upon which all good cookery depends. These have 
been long known practically to the French ; and having 
been of late years scientifically confirmed, they now 
rank as facts of organic chemistry. 



PROVIDING. 



CHAPTER I. 
RULES FOR PROVIDING. 

A CERTAIN practical ladj, giving a receipt for making 
hare soup, began with — "First catch your hare.** Upon 
the same principle we shall premise our instructions in 
cooking by a few hints on procuring and keeping pro- 
visions. 

1. In the first place, the housewife ought always, 
where it is possible, to do her marketing herself, and 
pay ready -money for everything she purchases. This 
is the only w&j in which she can be sure of getting the 
best goods at the lowest price. We repeat that this is 
the only way compatible with strict economy, because 
if a servant be entrusted with the buying, she will, if 
she is not a good judge of the quality of articles, bring 
home those she can get for the least money (and these 
are seldom the chea'pest), and even if she is a good judge, 
it is ten to one against her taking the trouble to make 
a careful selection. When the ready -money system is 
found inconvenient, and an account is run with a trades- 
man, the mistress ought herself to write her orders 
in a pass-book to be sent to the shop to have the prices 
filled in, and to be returned along with the goods ; and 
on receipt of these she should see that they tally with 
lier entry in the pass-book. Where this is not done, it 
sometimes happens, either by mistake, or the dishonesty 
of the tradesman or his shopman or the servant, that 
payment is demanded for goods which were never 
ordered, and that those which were ordered are over- 
charged. The simplest and safest plan, however, is to 
avoid running accounts altogether, and to pay ready- 
money. By so doing, the housewife will escape a great 
deal of trouble and anxiety, besides saving the extra 
price which the tradesman charges upon all goods 



•f 



PROVIDING. O 

sold on credit, and to which he is justly entitled, both 
as interest for his money and to coyer the losses to 
which the system sonjietimes subjects him. 

2. In purchasing perishable goods, care should be 
taken to get everything b.s fresh and new as possible. 
This is absolutely necessary in the case of vegetables, 
ripe fruit, eggs, butter, and fish, as these cannot be 
used in too fresh a condition ; but as butcher meat 
requires to be kept some time, it may, where the 
butcher's word can be trusted as to the day on which it 
was killed, be purchased ready for cooking. Indeed 
this must often be done when a small supply of cut 
meat, such as steaks or chops, is required. As, how- 
ever, it is the butcher's interest to sell off his meat 
while fresh, in order to avoid the loss arising from its 
spoiling on his hands, he will seldom have any prime 
pieces which have been kept long enough for immediate 
use, so that it is much safer, as a general rule, to ask for 
it fresh, and keep it at home. Perhaps the best plan 
is to ascertain which day of the week is the butcher's 
regular " killing day," and to buy upon that day only 
a quantity sufficient to last some time, — which quantity 
must be determined by the season of the year ; for since 
meat keeps longer in winter than in summer, a larger 
stock may be laid in then. Many a good dinner has 
been spoiled, and many a fine piece of meat wasted, and 
this not from ignorance of the time it ought to be kept, 
but from inattention to the above rule. 

3. When it is ascertained where the best and cheap- 
est articles are sold, it is as well to lay in as large a 
stock as can be afforded at one time, of those provisions 
which do not spoil by keeping. By so doing, the house- 
wife will not only have a good supply of the best always 
at hand, but will also be allowed certain discounts from 
the price, which she would not otherwise obtain, besides 
saving much time and trouble in shopping. Not only 
will she have to go oftener to the shop for small sup- 
plies, but it may frequently happen that when she ap- 
plies for a second small quantity of an article that has 



6 HOW TO CHOOSE 

been approved of, she may find the dealer's stock of 
that particular commodity renewed, and the new supply 
not so good ; and she then will either have to purchase 
an inferior article, or to wander from shop to shop in 
search of a better. Of course this rule must be disre- 
garded when, at the time of purchase, there is reason 
to expect an immediate fall in the price. For instance, 
it would be absurd to buy a three months' supply of 
tea at 48., with the knowledge that within a month there 
might be such a reduction of duty upon it as would 
lower its price to 3s. Such cases, however, occur very 
rarely. 

SIGNS OF GOOD QUALITIES IN PROVISIONS. 

To facilitate the choice of the best provisions, the 
following indications of quality should be attended to. 



As a general rule, the best meat is that which is mo- 
derately fat. Lean meat must have been ill fed, and 
will be tough and tasteless. Very fat meat, though it 
may be good, is not economical ; and therefore, when 
none else is to be had, the butcher ought to directed 
to cut off the superfluous suet before weighing it. 

1. Beef. The flesh should feel tender, have a fine 
grain, and a clear red colour. The fat should be mode- 
rate in quantity, lying in streaks through the lean, and 
its colour should be white or very liglU yellow. Ox beef 
is the best, — heifer very good if well fed, — cow and 
bull, decidedly inferior. 

2. Mutton. The flesh, like that of beef, should be 
of a good red colour, perhaps a shade darker. It should 
be fine-grained, and well streaked with fat, which ought 
to be white and firm. The mutton of the black -fiaced 
breed of sheep is the finest, and may be known by 
the shortness of the shank ; the best age is about five 
years, though it is seldom to b^ had so old. Wether 
mutton is superior to either ram or ewe, and may be 



BUTOHBR MEAT, BACON, &C. 7 

distinguished by having a prominent lump of fat on the 
broadest part of the inside of the leg. The flesh of the 
ram has a very dark colour and is of a coarse texture ; 
that of the ewe is pale, and the fat yellow and spongy. 

3. Veal. Its colour should be white, with a tinge 
of pink ; it ought to be rather fat, and feel firm to the 
touch. The flesh should have a fine delicate texture. 
The leg-bone should be small ; the kidney small and 
well covered with fat. The proper age is about two or 
three months ; when killed too young, it is soft, flabby, 
and dark-coloured. The buU-csJf makes the best veal, 
though the cow-calf is preferred for many dishes on ac- 
count of the udder. 

4. Lamb. This should be light-coloured and fat, and 
have a delicate appearance. The kidneys should be 
small and imbedded in fat, the quarters short and thick, 
and the knuckle stiff*. When fresh, the vein in the fore 
quarter will have a bluish tint. If the vein look green 
or yellow, it is a certain sign of staleness, which may 
also be detected by smelling the kidneys. 

5. Pork. Both the flesh and the fat must be white, 
firm, smooth, and dry. When young and fresh, the lean 
ought to break when pinched with the fingers, and the 
skin, which should be thin, yield to the nails. The 
breed having short legs, thick neck, and small head, is 
the best. Six months is the right age for killing, when 
the leg should not weigh more than 6 or 7ft)s. Measley 
pork is known by the fat being mottled with little 
lumps and kernels. 

Generally, all meat, when not fresh, has a tainted 
smell about the kidneys, and the eyes are sunk and 
shrivelled instead of being plump and full. 



Baoon and Ham may be considered good when the 
rind is thin, the fat white and firm, and when the flesh 
adheres to the bone and has a clear, darkish red colour, 
not streaked with yellow. To test the perfect fresh- 
ness of ham, run a knife into it close to the bone, and 
if when drawn out it has a pleasant smell, and is not 



8 HOW TO CHOOSE EGOS, 

smeared, the ham is fresh. If either bacon or ham have 
the slightest tinge of yellow in the fat, it will soon be- 
come rancid. 

BuTTEB and Cheese should be judged of by tasting. 

EoGS. It is difficult to discover if an egg be fresh. 
The best plan is to hold it between the eye and a 
lighted candle, close to the light, when if it appears 
equally transparent throughout, it may be pronounced 
good, but if there are any cloudy spots apparent it may 
be rejected as stale. 



Birds of all kinds are best when young. The thin 
bone projecting over the belly will then feel soft and 
gristly j if it is stiff and hard, the bird is old. All 
poultry should be firm and fleshy. 

1. Fowls are best when short and plump, with broad 
breast and thick rump, the legs smooth and the spurs 
short and blunt. The black-legged kind are the most 
juicy. In capons, the comb should be short arid pale — 
in cocks, short and bright red. If fresh, the vent will 
be close and dark ; when stale, it will be tainted, and 
the eyes sunk. 

2. Tubkets. The same remarks apply to these as 
to fowls. The cock turkey is preferable to the hen. 
When young, the toes and bill are soft. 

3. Geese. The flesh should be of a fine light pink 
tint, the liver pale, the fat white and soft, and the breast 
full and plump. In a young goose, the feet and bill 
are yellow ; in an old one, reddish. It ought to have 
very few or no hairs on the body. 

4. Ducks. Young ducks are distinguished in the 
same manner as young geese. The belly should be firm 
and thick. The drake is the best eating. 

4. Pigeons. The breast should be full and plump, 
and the feet elastic. When not fresh, they are flabby, 
and the vent discoloured. 



POULTRY, GAME, AND FISH. 9 



1. Wild Fowl, when young, have soft quills, and 
should be plump, and hard in the vent. Old birds are 
distinguished by rigid bills, tough leg-sinews, and long 
and sharp spurs ; they require to be kept longer than 
young ones. Small field-birds should always be used 
fresh. 

2. Venison. The flesh of good venison is dark, fine- 
grained, and firm, and the fat clear And bright, lying 
thickly on the back. When young, the cleft of the 
hoof is smooth and close. 

3. Hares and Rabbits are fresh when the body is 
rigid. Young ones have the claws smooth, sharp, and 
close, and the ears tender and easily torn. 



Stale fish furnishes such unmistakeable evidence of 
its condition, both to sight and smell, that the merest 
novice who should purchase it would be inexcusable. 
When perfectly fresh, the body is stiff and elastic ; the 
gills close, difficult to open, and bright ; the fins lying 
flat to the sides ; the eyes bright and full ; the scales 
glistening and firmly attached to the body. When stale, 
it is the reverse of all this, and has besides a strong of- 
fensive smell. The best fish of all kinds Have small 
heads and tails, thick bodies, and broad shoulders. 

TuRBOT. A good one has the belly cream-coloured ; 
and if that and the fins be streaked withered, it is an 
additional sign of freshness. 

Skate. When good, the belly is white, tinged with 
lilac. The female is preferred. Those with large thorns 
are very inferior. 

Lobsters and Crabs should feel heavy ; — when light , 
they are filled with water; which may also be known 
in lobsters by the berries being large and brownish. 
In crabs, after being boiled, the water, if there be any, 
may be heard rattling on shaking them. The male is 
better than the female, and is distinguished in the lob- 



10 TO CHOOSE VEGETABLES, &C. 

ster by a narrow tail, in the crab by a narrow breast. 
The lobster when in perfection has a hard firm shell, 
and may be considered very superior if encrusted with 
marine animals. 

Prawns and Shrimps are good when their tails turn 
strongly inwards, and when they have no unpleasant 
smell. They are best when very red, and free from 
spawn under the tail. 

Oysters, if alive and healthy, will close upon the 
knife when being opened. Pandore oysters from the 
Firth of Forth, and those from the Kent coast in Eng- 
land, are considered the best. 

Mussels are very good and wholesome when gathered 
from banks on the open coast, but those from the mouths 
of rivers and harbours where there is much shipping 
are often highly dangerous, being impregnated with 
poisonous matter from the copper sheathing of the 
ships' bottoms. For the same reason, those from wet 
docks ought never to be used. 

Besides the above there are several other species of 
shell-fish, — viz. the Escalop, Eazor-fish, Clams, 'and Coc- 
kles, which, though very good, are scarce, and not much 
used. Whelks are more plentiful, and are considered 
very wholesome. All bivalve shell-fish should be pro- 
cured alive, when the shells will be found firmly closed. 
If purcha^d ready cooked, as mussels and whelks often 
are, their freshness must be judged of by the smell. 

VBOBTABX.B8. 

All Green Vegetables of the cabbage kind should be 
chosen with large, close, firm hearts. When fresh, the 
leaves are crisp and brittle ; when stale, they are lank 
and drooping. They ought to be used as soon as pos- 
sible after being gathered, as they are apt to spoil by 
long keeping. Such perfect freshness is not so abso- 
lutely necessary in roots such as potatoes, turnips, &c. 



KEEPING PROVISIONS. 11 

CHAPTER II. 
KEEPING PROVISIONS. 

Feesh Meat of every description should be hung up in 
a cool, dry, airy place, and carefully wiped every day. 
It ought never to lie long in a dish. The length of 
time it should be kept varies with the weather, as 
during warm moist weather it spoils much sooner than 
in cold and dry weather. Game, generally, will keep 
longer than butcher meat, — two or three weeks ; birds 
being kept with the feathers on, and hares paunched, 
but not skinned. Beef will require from four to ten 
days' keeping, or even longer in cold weather; and 
mutton, if well managed, will sometimes hang for a 
fortnight or even three weeks without spoiling — the 
longer the better. As young meat, however — veal, 
lamb, and pork — spoils very quickly, one, two, or three 
days at the utmost, suffices for it. Fowls will keep for 
a week, and turkeys a fortnight, but a goose not above 
nine or ten days< In plucking birds which have been 
kept some time, care should be taken not to break the 
skin, which will have become rather tender. 

As all animal food, however good in quality, and how- 
ever well it may be cooked, is uneatable when stale, 
and, except fish, will certainly prove tough if cooked 
too fresh, it becomes a matter of considerable difficulty, 
particularly during summer, to fix upon the proper 
day for cooking a piece of meat which has been kept. 
It is only by daily examination, and narrowly watch- 
ing the change which the meat undergoes, that the 
housewife will be able to arrest its decomposition at 
that stage, just short of being tainted, in which it is 
ready for being cooked. This is an art which can be 
acquired only by experience, and its successful practice 
requires considerable skill in household management. 
Thus, should unlooked-for cold weather have prevented 



12 KEEPING PROVISIONS. 

the meat reaching the proper cooking state upon the 
day calculated on^ the prudent and active housewife 
will have to provide some other dinner for that day, 
and keep the meat till the next^ or the next again. It 
cannot be too strongly impressed upon housekeepers 
that even the best butcher meat, when cooked too soon, 
will not be nearly so tender and paTatable as meat much 
inferior, which has been kept the proper time. 

There are various ways of keeping meat sweet, and 
of removing the bad smell after it has become slightly 
tainted. One mode is to rub it over with coarsely- 
pounded charcoal, which has the property of absorbing 
all the putrescent gases, and thus prevents the bad 
smell. The charcoal must of course be washed off be- 
fore cooking. Another way is to paint the meat all 
over with pyroligneous acid or wood vinegar, which is 
an antiseptic, and considerably retards the progress of 
decay. Should the decomposition have already gone 
rather too far, the meat may be partly restored by 
steeping it, for a short time before using, in a solution 
of chloride of lime. This latter plan is very useful, 
especially in warm weather, for game, which is gene- 
nJly preferred with that high flavour produced by long 
keeping, as it entirely removes any accompanying smell. 
Dusting meat well with black pepper is a preservative 
against flies, which however will not get at it if it is 
kept in a properly constructed meat safe. This is a 
lock-fEist box or closet, the sides of which consist of 
canvas, hair-cloth, or perforated zinc, stretched upon a 
frame. It should be placed in an airy yet sheltered 
situation, not exposed to the sun. A few shelves and 
several tinned hooks attached to the top or roof are its 
interior fittings. 

Cooked Meat ought to be kept as cool and dry as 
possible. When sent from table to be set aside for fu- 
ture use, it ought to be removed into a clean dry dish, 
keeping back the gravy, which is apt soon to become 
sour, and therefore ought to be kept in a seperate ves- 
sel A cold joint is always richer and more juicy if it

has not been cut while warm, because when cut warm 
the juices run out at the incision. 

Gbeen Vegetables cannot be kept longer than a day 
or two, and then it must be in a cool dry cellar, free 
from draughts of air, otherwise they are sure to lose 
their flavour and perhaps to ferment, in which case they 
become unwholesome. Each kind should be kept by 
itself, to prevent contamination of flavour. They should 
never be placed in water till immediately before being 
used. Roots, such as carrots, turnips, &c., will remain 
good a considerable time if kept cool and dry j but they 
must not be washed, but be stored in dry sand just as 
they are taken from the ground. In winter they must 
be protected from frost. Onions keep best when hung 
up in a cool but dry place. — the large ones strung, 
the small ones in nets. Parsley and other herbs may 
be preserved by drying them either in bunches tied 
to a rope in a warm kitchen, or spread out in an oven 
nearly cold. 



CHAPTEK III. 
COOKING APPARATUS. 

A MOST important point in the economy of the kitchen 
is to cook with as little fuel as possible. To do this it 
is requisite that the apparatus should be complete, and 
no larger than is necessary for the requirements of the 
household. 

The Kitchen Range. It is a very common error 
to have this much too large, whereby a considerable loss 
is occasioned by an unnecessary consumption of fuel. 
The most economical form of range is that which has a 
comparatively small open fireplace in the centre, with a 
boiler on one side and extending round the back, and a 
small oven having a furnace underneath it on the other, 
— the whole being flat on the top. By means of such a

tions of roasting, boiling, stewing, and baking, may all 
be carried on simultaneously. Although the furnace 
under the oven need only be used when baking is re- 
quired, yet the oven will always be suflBiciently warm to 
heat dinner plates, whilst the boiler, which may be made 
self-filling, will furnish a constant and plentiful supply 
of hot water — an article which ought always to be obtain- 
able at a moment's notice in every house. M. Soyer has 
invented a i*ange (considerably more expensive however 
than the above), which with one fire can roast, boil, 
broil, bake, fry, braise, and saut6, all at the same time. 
It is so contrived as to stand in the middle of the kitchen, 
and occupies very little space. 

The various kitchen utensils, constituting the rest of 
the cooking apparatus, will be more properly described 
when treating of the different processes for which they 
are required. 

1. Roasting is performed by the direct action of the 
fire. The meat is suspended and kept in constant ro- 
tation in front of the fire by means of a twirling hook 
and a bottle-jack which is hung from a projecting arm 
or crane fixed in or above the mantel-piece. This arm 
has a number of notches on its upper side, by means of 
which the distance of the meat from the fire can be re- 
gulated at pleasure, and it moves upon a swivel, so that 
when not in use it may be turned back close to the wall. 
Beneath the meat is placed a stand containing a remov- 
able tin dish to catch the dripping, and from the back 
part of which a tin screen of a semicircular form, stands 
up behind the meat and reflects the heat upon it, there- 
by aiding the roasting. 

2. Bboilinq is the cooking of small articles, such as 
herrings, slices of meat, &c., over the fire, and by its 
direct action. It is perhaps the most ancient and pri- 
mitive mode of cooking. The savage hunter broils his 
steak cut from the still bleeding animal, upon the live 
embers of his wood fire. The civilized man, more 
cleanly, broils his upon a gridiron, over a clear smoke- 



ROASTING^ BOILING, &C. 15 

less fire of coals, haying taken care to have it cut from 
an animal killed at least a week previously. In point 
of tenderness the two steaks are said to be upon a par. 
Those who have tried it, declare that meat cooked while 
still warm from the newly-killed animal is very tender. 
Perhaps the steak cut from the live animal, said to be 
so much relished in Abyssinia, owes its popularity there 
to the same cause. 

The Gridiron should have small round bars, and must 
be kept thoroughly clean, not only on the top of the 
bars, but between them. For turning the meat, a 
pair of small tongs is preferable to a fork, which makes 
holes in it, through which the juice runs out. When 
the meat is in proper condition, broiling is by far the 
best mode of cooking, and it is certainly the most ex- 
peditious. 

3. Baking is best accomplished in a properly con- 
structed oven ; but small cakes, puddings, &c., can be 
very well baked in front of the fire in a " Dispatch," 
which is a tin box with an open front, so made as to 
reflect the heat equally over whatever is placed in it. 
Baking on a small scale may also be done over the fire 
in a large dry goblet, with a close fitting lid. As this 
however is apt to melt the tin lining, an old goblet 
which has already lost its lining ought to be used, and 
care should be taken to warm it gradually lest it be 
cracked by the heat. Whatever is baked in a goblet 
must be placed upon a tin trevet to keep it from the 
hot bottom. A large number of cakes or scones may 
be baked in this way by placing each upon a separate 
trevet, and making a pUe of them inside the pot. 

4. Boiling is done in an iron pot (called a goblet in 
Scotland, in England a saucepan) tinned on the inside. 
It should be sufficiently large to contain water enough 
to cover the meat. Besides one or two large goblets, 
it is convenient to have several of the very smallest size, 
of block tin, for making sauces, &c. For boiling fish 
an oval tin fish-kettle is required, with a flat drainer to 
place beneath the fish while boiling, in order to lift it 
out whole when done.

5. Stewinq differs from boiling in this, that a much 
smaller quantity of water is employed ; which being en- 
riched by the juices of the meat, is served as a gravy 
along with it. Meat cooked in this way has been re- 
commended as more wholesome than when boiled, be- 
cause, the liquor in which it was cooked being taken 
along with it, it perfectly supplies the requirements of 
of the theory that as the human body is made up of 
precisely the same elements as raw butcher meat is, 
and these in precisely the same proportions, therefore, 
in order to supply the waste of the body, the meat 
ought to be eaten entire, with none of its constituents 
abstracted in the cooking. Although, however, ex- 
perience appears to confirm the truth of this theory in 
the case of boiled and stewed meat, it is to be feared 
that its strict application would necessitate our eating 
hones, and many other matters even not quite so palat- 
able or digestible. It may even be doubted whether 
the theory will apply at all, seeing that its propounders 
have analyzed merely the dead human body, and conse- 
quently cannot say what the living body is composed 
of ; or even granting it to be identical with the dead 
one, it never can be known that the changes which food 
undergoes during nutrition, which are admittedly not 
chemical, do not amount in some cases to actual trans- 
mutation of elememts. 

The Stew-pan is a much shallower vessel than the 
sauce-pan for boiling. It is also of iron, tinned inside. 
All boiling and stewing vessels ought to have close- 
fitting lids. 

G. Beaising is a French improvement upon stewing. 
The method is nearly the same, the difference being 
that braising is done in an air-tight vessel, so that none 
of the volatUe matters escape, and that the heat is im- 
plied above as well as below. For this latter purpose 
live embers are placed upon the lid of the braising-pan, 
which is made hollow on the top to receive them. 
Braising is a very slow process, and perhaps its supe- 
riority over good stewing is not worth the extra trouble 
required. 



STEWING, FRYING, &C. 17 

7. Frying. There are two modes of frying. The 
first is called by the French cooks sautSinff, and is that 
which is most generally adopted by the middle and 
poorer classes in this country, being considered the 
most economical. Its use is confined to the cooking of 
small articles having the form of a fiat cake or slice. 
It requires merely a flat uncovered shallow pan with a 
straight handle (the usual frying-pan), in which there 
has been heated just enough of dripping or Florence oil 
to prevent the article from sticking to ^the bottom. 
When browned on one side the article is turned, — if it 
is a slice of meat, with a pair of tongs as in broiling j 
if fish, a perforated tin slice is used. When a single 
article is cooked at a time, an expert cook will turn it 
by tossing it into the air and catching it on the other 
side. The pan should have a thick bottom, and be 
made of malleable iron. 

The other method of frying is performed by com- 
pletely immersing the article in hot oil or fat. In this 
case the frying-pan must be six or eight inches deep 
(a small fish-kettle answers very well), and be filled to 
the depth of three or four inches with melted dripping, 
or, for some purposes, Florence oil ; and when this is 
heated sufficiently, the fish, or whatever it may be, is 
let gently down into it, — if large, in a wire basket by 
which it can be easily lifted out. 

This method is best adapted for the larger-sized fish, 
which may thus be cooked in good-sized pieces, or even 
whole. As soon as a large piece of fish has become 
browned, the fire ought to be moderated, and the fry- 
ing completed at a lower temperature. This will pre- 
vent the outside being over-done before the inside is 
properly cooked. It may seem singular, but it is the 
case, that in both these modes of frying, more particu- 
larly in the latter, very little, if any, of the oil or fat is 
imbibed by the food. The reason is, that the boiling 
liquid, which ought to be considerably hotter than 
boiling water, hardens and partly carl}onizes the sur- 
face of whatever is placed in it, and so forms a skin or 

c 



18 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

crust which is impervious to the oil The articles thus 
treated being generallj small^ the heat penetrates them 
with sufficient rapidity to cook them thoroughly before 
this crust acquires any great thickness. In order more 
effectually to prevent their absorbing the oij, they are 
sometimes coated with batter, or egg and bread crumbs, 
which very quickly set, and besides excluding the oil, 
serve in a great measure to protect the meat itself from 
the hardening influence of the extreme heat. 

Besides the necessary utensils above mentioned^ the 
kitchen ought to be furnished with a good-sized braai 
pan for making fruit preserves, a meat saw, chopper, 
and block; a pastry slab of hard wood, or what is better, 
of slate or marble, a rolling-pin and a paste-brush ; a 
stout pair of scissors, and several kitchen knives and 
spoons; also a number of bowls and baking dishes, tin or 
earthenware jelly moulds ; a colander, a dredging box, 
and several sieves (both of hair and wire), a jelly bag 
and several tammies, pudding-cloths, towels and scrub- 
bing brushes ; a number of skewers, and some small 
boxes for holding spices, &c. None of these articles 
are very expensive, and, although a contriving house- 
wife may manage to dispense with several of them, they 
all greatly conduce to the comfort and convenience of 
the cook. Of course, the extent to which a house is 
provided with them must depend on the size of the 
establishment and the master's means. 



CHAPTER IV. 

GENEBAL PRINCIPLES TO BE KEPT IN VIEW IN 
EVEBY PBOCESS OF COOKEBY. 

In order to impart a rational comprehension of these, 
it is necessary to say somewhat regarding the constitu- 
tion and nature of food. 



OF ALL COOKERY. 19 

All animal flesh consists chieflj of five different sub- 
stances. There is first the muscular fibre^ which, when 
separated from the other constituents, is white, and per- 
fectly tasteless. It is insoluble in cold water, and when 
exposed to the heat of boiling water becomes hard and 
homj. Then there are numerous memhranov,8 tissues 
which are also insoluble in cold water, but which boil- 
ing water slowly dissolves, changing them into glue or 
gelatine, which forms a jelly on cooling. Thirdly, there 
is the albumen, a substiance which in raw meat remains 
dissolved in the juice, but which becomes completely 
coagulated at a temperature (about 140^), considerably 
below that of boiling water, which is 212^ Lastly, 
there exist, dissolved in the juice of raw meat, the red 
colouring m>aUer, which coagulates and becomes brown 
at 150^^, and the sapid and odorous parts of the meat, 
called the osmazome, which can only be separated from 
the water of the juice by evaporation. It is this last 
constituent in which alone the taste of the meat is to 
be found. Apart from it, the others are nearly insipid. 
Some kinds of meat become eatable when their albumen 
has been coagulated by a heat of 140^. At this stage 
flesh still retains its raw red colour, and is very juicy and 
tender. The red inside part of roast meat, so much 
liked by many individuals is an instance of it. Flesh 
may be said to be thoroughly cooked when the colour- 
ing matter also is coagulated, the temperature required 
being a little above 150^ At this stage the meat 
will have entirely lost its raw appearance, and be 
perfectly tender. If however the meat in cooking be 
heated to the boiling point, 212^, it becomes much 
firmer, from the hardening of the fibre ; and if kept 
long at that heat, tender meat will become hard if 
roasted, and tough if boiled. Should the boiling be 
continued a considerable time, the hardened fibres of 
the meat will separate, let out a great part of the juices, 
and become almost tasteless ; in fact, the meat will be 
" boiled to rags." By such a process an ignorant cook 
will profess to boil m>eat tender, when she has merely 



-0 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 

converted it into something resembUng tow, wd con- 
demned the unfortunate eater perhaps to a fit of indi- 
gestion, and most certainly to half an hour's hard la- 
bour with the toothpick. 

For cooking vegetable substances a boiling heat is 
always necessary. Their cellular tissues are softened and 
opened up by it, their starch converted from an in- 
soluble into a soluble substance, and the whole rendered 
more digestible. 

It is upon the foregoing facts that the following 
General Principles or Rules are founded : — 

Ist. In making soups, sauces, &c,, in which only a 
strong highly-flavoured fluid extract of meat is required, 
the meat ought to be cut into very small pieces or thin 
slices, and then verj/ slowly digested in lukewarm water, 
hut not allowed to boil until the end of the process. 
The boiling then throws up a scum, which shoold be 
carefully removed, and the liquor strained. 

By this process the juices of the meat are in the first 
place thoroughly extracted while still soluble, and then 
cooked by being boiled. The scum consists of the 
coagulated albumen and colouring matter, which, being 
tasteless and dirty-looking, is removed. The boiling 
also dissolves the gelatinous tissues of the meat, whid^ 
although imparting no taste, serve to enrich and thicken 
the soup, and, if the liqour be sufficiently concentrated, 
will cause it to congeal when cooled. Of course the 
meat will have become tough and tasteless, in which 
state it is unfit to be eaten. If the opposite course he 
followed, — if the meat be thrown at once into boiling 
water, — the extreme heat will at once harden the sur- 
face, both by contracting the fibrine and coagulating 
the albumen ; and the latter, instead of being extracted 
in a dissolved state to be afterwards thrown up as scum 
by boiling, will mostly remain in the meaty and there 
becoming solid, will so choke up all the minute vessels 
containing the savoury juice, as effectually to prevent 
the water entering them to extract it ; and it will onlj 
be by long-continued boiling that even the gelatine will 



OF ALL COOKERY, 21 

be dissolyed. Thus the soup will be poor in taste, 
though rich in glue ; showing that the strength of soup 
ought not to be estimated, as is often done, by the 
firmness of the jelly it makes on cooling. 

2d. Meat which is to be eaten, ought never to be 
heated to the boiling point of water. 

From what has already been said, the necessity of 
this must be evident. As a heat of 150 or 165 degrees 
is the highest required to cook meat thoroughly, every 
degree above that involves a waste of fuel ; and a boil- 
ing heat (212^), which is the greatest that can possibly 
be applied to meat boiled in an open vessel, is that at 
which it is certain to become hard and tough. 

This rule may perhaps at first sight appear to be con- 
tradicted by some of the directions given in the receipts 
which follow, but it is really not so. Thus in the di- 
rections for boiling, it is said that the meat must be 
put into boiling water. This, however, is merely pre- 
paratory to cooking it, — it is done in order to seal up, 
by the boiling heat, the orifices of the juice-vessels, so 
as to prevent the water entering, and the gravy from 
flowing out. For the same purpose, meat which is to 
be stewed is first browned or saut^ed in the stew-pan j 
the main part of the cooking being in both cases done 
by slbwly simmering. Neither is this rule. infringed 
in frying or. broiling, because these processes are ap- 
plied only to slices of meat so thin that they are 
thoroughly cooked before the extreme heat applied to 
them has time to penetrate farther than a very little 
depth from the surface. The flesh of fish is naturally 
so very soft and flaccid that it requires the hardening 
influence of a high temperature to make it palatable. 
It is therefore plunged at once into boiling water, and 
the ebullition kept up as briskly as possible until the 
flsh is cooked. 

M. The third rule, which is but a deduction from the 
second, is, that large pieces of meat require cooking for 
a longer time and at a lower temperature than small 
pieces. 



22 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

The reason of this must be obvioiis ; for if a 1^ of 
mutton, for instance, were to be exposed to the heat 
required to broil or fry a beef steak, and for the same 
time, it would merely be cooked on the outside to the 
depth of half the thickness of a beef steak ; and if it 
were broiled till the part next the bone was cooked 
(which would take nearly as lon^: as to roast it properly), 
by far the greater portion of it would be burnt almost 
to a cinder. And if, on the other hand, a beef steak 
were to be roasted precisely as a leg of mutton is, it 
would soon become as hard and dry as a tile, — not 
from being oyerheated, but from its moisture being all 
eyaporated. 

By proper attention to rule 1st in making soups and 
meat sauces, or preparing «tocl; for either, the maximum 
of flavour and strength deriyable from the quantity of 
meat employed in their preparation will always be ob- 
tained, which is the only r^ult consistent with strict 
economy. Rules 2d and 3d, but more especially the 
former, will, if strictly followed, ensure tender and 
juicy meat, by whatever process it may be cooked. 

As nothing should be thrown aside which can in any 
way be made useful, the economical housewife will save 
both the exhausted meat from which soup has been 
made, and the liquor in which boiled meat had been 
cooked, for both of which a use may be found, as will 
afterwards be shown in its proper place. 



CHAPTER V. 
BOASTora. 



GEKBBAL DIRECTIONS. 

An hour previous to putting the meat to the fire, the 
grate should be well cleared of ashes, and a fire made up 
suited to the size of the joint, so that when required it 



FOR ROASTING. 23 

will be clear and glowing. Let all the cooking utensils 
be thoroughly clean and bright. Let the meat be pro- 
perly jointed, which facilitates the carving and prevents 
haggling the roast. Wash the meat well in salt and 
water, and dry it thoroughly, after which it should be 
handled as little as possible. Draw the live coal to the 
front of the grate, and put on a backing of wet cinders 
and small coal ; this will maintain and throw forward 
the heat. If the meat is very fat, which it ought not 
to be, cut off the superfluous suet, leaving only enough 
for basting, and cover it over with a piece of buttered 
white paper tied on with twine. When skewering is 
necessary, use as few skewers as possible, so as to 
avoid making too many holes in the meat by which the 
gravy escapes. Fix the joint upon the hook of the 
jack in such a way that every part may be equally 
acted on by the fire. Then hang it before the fire at 
such a distahce that it will not be scorched on the out- 
side before being warmed through, and adjust the 
screen and dripping pan. As soon as the fat begins to 
melt, the joint cannot be too frequently basted with 
the dripping thus formed. In cases where the dripping 
is scanty, butter must be u^ed for basting. If more 
dripping falls into the pan than is necessary for the 
purpose, it should be removed- before it gets at all 
scorched by the heat, or by cinders falling into it. The 
time required for roasting depends on the size and 
shape of the joint as well as on the kind of meat. Al- 
though a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat is 
usually the time allowed, yet it must be noted that 
generally fat meat requires more time than lean, that 
fillets and legs take longer than loins or breasts, and 
that veal and pork take longer than any other kind of 
meat. If the roast is large and requires long cooking, 
the fire may be mended once, or perhaps twice, before 
it is finished. To do this, the roast- and dripping-pan 
must be removed from the fire while the ashes are 
raked out of the front of the grate and fresh coals put 
on at the back. , When the roast is nearly ready, the 



24 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

paper should be removed and the joint brought nearer 
the fire, where it should remain, being all the while 
diligently basted, until it has acquired a fine rich brown 
colour. About a quarter of an hour before remoying 
the meat from the fire, sprinkle it lightlj from a dred- 
ging box, with a mixture of weU-dried flour and fine 
salt. When dishing the roast, remove the dripping 
from the gravj in the dripping pan, and put the gravj 
into the dish along with the meat. This is the best 
sauce that can be taken with any kind of roast meat, 
and if the meat be good, especially beef or mutton, 
there will be plenty of it. Should the gravy, however, 
prove scanty, the dripping pan, if it has been kept firee 
from ashes, may be rinsed out with a very little bdiling 
water and salt, and this poured over the meat. If ele- 
gance be desiderated, the end of the knuckle or shank- 
bone, where there is one, may be ornamented with a cut 
paper frill. All dishes and plates sent to table for hot 
joints should be well warmed. 

The flavour of the more insipid kinds of meat, such 
as veal, poultry, Ac, is frequently heightened by staff- 
ing them with forcemeat before roasting. This is ahighly 
seasoned mixture of a number of savoury substances, 
for the compounding of which, from its very nature as 
a matter of taste, no definite rules can be given. In 
some of the receipts which follow, a few examples of 
stuffing are given, which merely show the substances 
usually employed, and the proportions which will be 
found very good. But it must be distinctly understood 
that the cook is by no means restricted to these, and 
ought to exercise her invention and discretion as to the 
materials and their proportions, according to circam- 
stances and the taste of those for whom she provides. 

The dripping removed from the pan during the pro- 
cess of roasting should be preserved thus : — Before it 
cools, pour it into boiling water, when all impurities, 
such as gravy, ashes, and small cinders, will fall to the 
bottom, the pure fat floating on the top. This when 
cold becomes a firm white cake. When a sufficient 



FOR ROASTING. 25 

number of such cakes are accumulated^ melt them all 
together in an earthenware jar placed in boiling water, 
and on cooling there will be a solid mass of pure white 
dripping, which will keep fresh for a considerable time. 
Beef and lamb dripping thus prepared is useful for fry- 
ing, and making pie-crust. That from mutton, being 
tallowy, is not so good, while most other kinds of drip- 
ping are never used in cookery. They should however be 
collected and preserved as above, along with fat skim- 
mings from boiled meat, broth, kc, and the accumu- 
lation sold to the candlemakers or soap-boilers. Eco- 
nomical housewifes in the country, or those who have 
a fancy for such operations, make their own candles 
and soap for common purposes from it. Either plan is 
more thrifty than throwing away refuse fat, 

Joints of meat may be very well roasted in a baker's 
oven. For this purpose the meat must be prepared as 
for roasting in usual way, and then placed upon a stout 
wire trevet in a large brown earthen pan about two 
inches deep, which will withstand the heat of the oven. 
Instead of a trevet, two or three sticks laid across the 
edges of the pan, will do to support the meat. The 
heat of the oven must be moderate, considerably less 
than is required for bread. When a small joint is 
cooked thus, it is a very good plan to bake a Yorkshire 
pudding or some potatoes in the pan under it. These 
will absorb and be enriched by the gravy of the meat, 
and. are a very nice accompaniment to the roast. 



The foregoing General Directions apply to roasts of 
every kind. It noff remains to point out the peculiar 
methods required for the different sorts of meat 



The best piece for roasting is the Sirloin, It should 
consist of at least three of the short ribs. One weigh- 
ing about twelve pounds may require two and a half 
hours' roasting, though this depends greatly upon the 
fire. When dished, it may be garnished with finely 



26 DIRECTIONS 

scraped horse-radisb, or this may be serred Beparatelj 
as a condiment (see Sauces, <&c.) Salt and mustard are 
almost universally taken with roast beef. A Yorkshire 
or a potato pudding (see Puddings) may be cooked be- 
fore the fire, under the roast. Besides these, plain 
boiled or mashed potatoes, mashed turnips, plain boiled 
rice or rice-pudding, greens, French beans, green pease, 
pease-pudding, oat-meal pudding, and suet dumplings, 
are all very good accompaniments for roast beef. 

The Bibs o/Bee/mBj be roasted in the same way and 
served with the same accompaniments as the sirloin. 
Before cooking, the bones are generlly sawn through, 
about three inches from the top, and removed, leaving 
a flap, which should be folded under, and secured with 
wooden skewers. 

The Thin flanh (called in Scotland the Nine-holes), 
boned and trimmed as for collaring (see Collared Beef), 
seasoned rather highly with pepper and salt, rolled up 
tightly and fixed with tape and small skewers, may be 
roasted as above. 

N. B. — The bones and trimmings removed from this 
and the preceding roast make excellent soup, as do also 
the remainder bones of cooked meat ; but the former 
are preferable, because being uncooked, their juices are 
more easily extracted. 

Ox Heart must be prepared for roasting thus: — Soak 
it one hour in lukewarm water to remove all the blood \ 
wash it well, and if large, placed it for ten or fifteen mi- 
nutes in boiling water. Wipe it dry, and fill the inside 
with a stuffing made of 4 ounces of bread crumbs, 
4 ounces of minced suet or butter, 2 ounces of parsley, 
and a teaspoonful each of powdered marjoram, thyme, 
and grated lemon-peel ; season to taste with pepper, 
salt, and nutmeg, and make it into a stifi* paste with a 
beaten Qgg. Ox-heart should be thoroughly cooked. 
Currant jelly or apple sauce is sometimes served with 
it in a sauce-tureen. 

An imitation of roast hare may be made from the 
lean inside of a large sirloin, cut up, stufied like hare

Tvith a highly seasoned forcemeat, fastened with skewers 
and tape, and then roasted. 

acvTTOir. 

The Leg or Gigot, the Shoulder , and the Zow, are 
the best parts for roasting. Before roasting the loin, 
the fat surrounding the kidneys ought to be removed, 
otherwise the dish, when the meat is cut up, will be 
flooded with melted dripping. It should likewise be 
properly jointed, for convenience in carving. The 
gravy may be eked out if necessary, as in beef, with a 
little boiling water and salt, or, if desired, a beef gravy 
may be used. 

The Neck of mutton (best end) makes a very good 
roast. It should be jointed like the loin. The Saddle, 
the Chine, and the Haunch of mutton, are respectively 
the two necks, the two loins, and the leg and loin, not 
separated. They are, however rather large for a small 
family. 

Onion, celery, and cucumber sauces are those gene- 
rally taken with roast mutton; — sometimes currant 
jelly is preferred. The vegetables to accompany roast 
mutton are generally the same as those used with roast 
beef Potatoes browned under the roast are much liked. 

VBAX.. 

The Fillet is prepared for roasting as follows: — Cut 
out the bone neatly, without disfiguring the meat, and 
fill its place with a stuffing composed of bread crumbs, 
butter or finely minced suet, thyme, parsley, and minced 
or grated lemon-peel, in the same proportions as for 
ox-heart, — the whole bound together with an egg, and 
seasoned with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Fold over the 
flap so as to secure the stuffing, and fix it with skewers 
or tape; tie over the ends, with twine, pieces of buttered 
white paper. Place it rather near the fire for the first 
ten minutes, after which remove it to such a distance 
that'^'it will roast very slowly. As Veal ought to be 
well and thoroughly cooked, it requires a longer time 



28 DIRECTIONS 

to roast than beef or mutton. If it does not yield 
enough dripping for basting, use butter. When nearly 
done, take off thd paper, and allow the joint to remain 
at the fire till browned. Remoye the fastenings when 
dished ; garnish with thin slices of lemon The usual 
hot water and salt poured over it will do for a gravy ; 
but thin melted butter (see receipt), to which, while 
boiling, a little mashroom ketchup or other savoury 
sauce has been added, is better. Boiled Ham is a very 
nice accompaniment to roast veal. 

The Breasty the ShottMer, the Loin, and the Neck, 
also make very good roasts. The breast and the shoul- 
der may be stuffed like the fillet. In the former, the 
stuffing must be inserted under the skin through a slit 
cut for the purpose; in the latter, it must be placed in 
a cavity formed by carefully cutting out the shoulder 
blade bone, — which is rather a difficult operation. 



Good young Lamb, being much smaller than mut- 
ton, is generally roasted in quarters. 

The Fore-^tiarter consists of the shoulder, neck, and 
breast together. The ribs of the breast should be broken 
across the middle. At table, the carver cuts off the 
shoulder first, which, if not immediately required, may 
be set aside to 1}e used cold, the cut surface being 
first sprinkled with salt or lemon juice. 

The Hind-quarter contains the leg and loin. The 
flap of the loin may be stuffed like veal, using perhaps 
less lemon-peel and more parsley If a rich gravy be 
desired, make it from beef ; if not, the usual hot water 
and salt will do. It is customary to serve mint sauce 
with roast lamb. 

The Leg, the Heck, and the Shoulder, separately make 
very good small roasts if carefully attended to ; and the 
remaining parts may be cooked in various other ways. 
Lamb, like veal, requires to be ** well done."

Being rery disagreeable when not thoroughly cooked, 
Pork should be slowly and cautiously roasted, not too 
near the fire; hence it takes a longer time than most 
other meats. 

The Leg is generally stuffed with a mixture of finely- 
chopped sage and onions, a few bread crumbs, and a 
little butter, — seasoned with pepper and salt and a small 
quantity of made mustard, and moistened with an %gg. 
This stuffing is placed in a pouch made by cutting a 
slit in the knuckle, near the thigh, and raising the skin ; 
the opening is then sewed up with pack-thread. If the 
leg is stuffed the day previous to roasting, its flavour is 
improved. Before putting it to the fire, the skin may 
be rubbed with salad oil, which will prevent it blister- 
ing, and it should then be neatly scored across in regu- 
lar stripes about half an inch apart, to assist the carver 
in separating the slices. When the drippi ng is deficient, 
the roast may be basted by rubbing it with a piece 
of butter tied up in a muslin bag. Should the rind or 
" crackling " be preferred well raised or blistered, the 
joint must be drawn rather near the fire a short time be- 
fore being lifted, and then it must be carefully watched 
and diligently basted, to prevent it from being burnt. 
Apple sauce, not too sweet, is the best for roast pork. 

The Chine, the Spare-rib, the Loin, the Neck, and 
the Griskin, are all roasted in the same way as the leg. 
The Shoulder may also be roasted, but is generally 
rather too fat for this purpose. The stuffing for the 
chine may be the same as that for the leg, or it may be 
varied by substituting parsley and thyme for the onions. 
A short time before being removed from the fire, the 
spare rib and the griskin may be sprinkled with dry 
pulverized sage-leaves. French beans and pease-pudding 
are favourite acompaniments for roast pork. 

Sucking Pig. — This much-esteemed delicacy ought 
to be cooked as fresh as possible. The Pig, having 
been properly prepared by the butcher, must be well

washed in cold water, and thoroughly dried. Then cut ' 
off the feet, and place in the inside a staffing made of 
the crumh of a penny roll, and a few sage leaves, but- 
ter, pepper, and salt. Sew up the belly, and fasten back 
the legs with small skewers so that the under part may 
have the full benefit of the fire. Being rubbed per- 
fectly dry, it may be either dusted with fiour, or smeared 
all over with white of egg applied with a feather, and 
immediately put to the fire. While it is roasting, baste 
it well with butter or salad oil. The skin ought to be 
nicely browned and crisp. It will t>ake about two hours, 
more or less, to roast. The usual mode of serving it 
is, to cut off the head and divide it and the body into 
halves lengthwise, to remove the brains and stuffing 
for the sauce, and to place the two halves of the body 
in the middle of the dish, and the jaws standing up on 
each side. The brains are then finely minced, and, along 
with the stuffing, mixed with hot beef gravy ; and this 
may be either added to the gravy in the dish, or served 
separately in a sauce-boat. Koast pig may also be stuffed 
like the leg of pork, and served with apple sauce.

Unless Venison be fat, roasting is by no means the 
best way to cook it. As the fat is considered a great 
delicacy, the main object of the cook must be to keep 
it from melting away, which venison fat is peculiarly 
apt to do. For this purpose the joint is generally en- 
veloped in a layer of flour-and- water paste, an inch thick, 
and this is covered with well-buttered or oiled paper. 
Thus prepared, it is placed rather near a good strong 
fire, until the paste becomes set, the paper being fre- 
quently basted with dripping to prevent its catching fire. 
It is then removed to such a distance from the fire that 
it will roast slowly. A Haunch weighing from twenty 
to twenty-five pounds will require at least three or four 
hours' roasting. It should not be overdone, as the flesh 
is naturally rather dry. About half an hour before 
the roasting is finished, the coverings may be removed. 



FOR ROASTING. 31 

and the meat placed rather nearer the fire to brown 
it; — it must then be diligently basted with fresh butter, 
and dredged with' flour and salt, like other roasts. A 
gravy may be made for it from beef or mutto;i, if its 
own is deficient. Sweet and acid sauces, — currant- 
jelly, or Sharp Sauce (see receipt), are usually served 
with venison. 

The roasting-pieces of venison are the same as those 
of mutton ; they are all treated as above. 

BABB, FAWN, SSD, and BABBIT. 

A young Hare which has been kept as long as the 
weather will permit, is the best for roasting. When 
old, it is much too tough and dry, and consequently 
does not make a good roast, though it will do for 
soup. When ready for roasting, cut ofif the feet, and 
skin it, commencing at the hind legs and drawing off 
the skin upwards to the head. Avoid tearing the ears 
in skinning them, as they are considered a dainty by 
some people. Soak and wash it well in several waters, 
and wipe it perfectly dry. Make a stuffing of the liver 
finely minced, and mixed with beef suet also minced 
very small, bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, and grated 
lemon-peel, in about the same proportions as for ox- 
heart; season this with pepper, salt, and nutmeg, 
moisten it with an ^gg and a little mushroom ketchup, 
fill the inside of the hare with it, and then sew up the 
belly. Cut the sinews of the hind legs, and fasten 
them and the fore-legs flat to the body with small 
skewers; likewise fix the head firmly between the 
shoulders by running a skewer through it into the 
body. Hang it, head downwards, before a strong fire. 
Baste it with salted hot water till the blood ceases to 
drop from it ; then clean out the dripping-pan, and 
baste the hare with milk. When nearly done, flour it 
lightly and baste it with butter. If preferred, butter 
may be used for the basting instead of milk. An hour 
and a half to two hours' roasting will be required, but 
this depends. of course upon the strength of the fire 



32 DIRECTIONS 

and iho sia^ of the bare. It is dished back upwardt, 
with the head erect, and served with rich beef fpnrj, 
and currant-jelly separate. 

It is a country fashion to stuff roast hare with a 
mixture of mashed potatoes, grated ham, suet^ and 
oniong, highly seaHoned with pepper and allspice. 

A very young Fawn or a Kid may be roasted in the 
same way as a bare. When somewhat grown, a fawn 
may be roasted in quarters, — covered, while roasting, 
with veal or lamb caul, or slices of fat bacon, and well 
basted. 

A hirge Rahhlt may be stuffed and roasted in the 
same way as a hare. Young rabbits and leverets need 
not be stuffed. Heing smaller than hares, of course 
they take less time to roast. 



All birds are prepared for cooking nearly in the 
same manner, as follows : — 

To pluck tliem, — Lay the bird upon a board with its 
head towards you, and holding it firmly with one hand, 
with the other pull out the feathers, away from 70a, 
in the direction in which they lie. When they are 
pulled in the contrary direction, the skin is rery apt 
to be torn. 

To draw poultry, — Cut off the head ; then make a 
slit at the back of the neck, and detaching the skin 
and the crop, draw out the neck and cut it off close to 
the body, leaving the loose skin long. Make another 
incision under the tail or in the side below the leg, 
ju.st large enough to allow the gizzard to pass through, 
and no larger. With the finger inserted through this^ 
carefully detach all the intestines, and then, squee^ng 
the bird, draw the whole gently out at the opening. In 
doing this, great care must be taken to aroid breaking 
the gall bladder and the gut which joins the gizzard, 
because otherwise it will be impossible to remove the 
bitter taste imparted by the contents of the one, or 
the grittiness derived from the other. In fowls, tnr- 



FOR ROASTING. 33 

kejs, and geese, break the legs by the middle of the 
fi»t joint, and draw out the sinews (this ought to be 
particularly attended to if the bird is not young), cut- 
ting off the parts at the joint. Press down the breast- 
bone ; — if the bird is large, this must be done by lay- 
ing it breast upwards upon the dresser, and having 
covered it with a thickly-folded cloth, beating it with 
the rolling-pin. [The foregoing operations are properly 
the poulterer's work, and the housewife will save her- 
self much trouble by making sure that he does it before 
sending home her purchases.] It must then be singed 
all over with a piece of lighted paper held under it, to 
remove the small hairs left after plucking it. The bird 
being now washed and thoroughly dried, is ready for 
trussing. This varies with the kind of bird, and mode 
of cooking. In every case the skewers and strings used 
must be removed before serving, and the bird dished 
with its breast upwards. 

A Fowl prepared as above is trussed thus : — Press 
down the legs close to the sides and back, and fix them 
by means of a skewer thrust through the thighs and the 
body. Place the liver and gizzard, — the latter split 
open, and both clean washed and dried, — one under 
each wing, and twist the pinion ends round upon the 
back. Fasten the wings close to the sides, by a skewer 
run through the joints and the body. The legs and 
wings may be farther secured by pieces of twine tied 
over them round the bird. 

When ready to put to the fire, 'place inside the fowl 
a piece of butter about the size of a walnut, well rolled 
in a mixture of pepper and salt, and tie up the skin of 
the neck. Hang it before the fire neck downwards, 
and baste it frequently with fresh butter. It will be 
roasted in from half an hour to an hour, according to 
the size of fowl and the strength of the fire. Large 
fowls may be stuffed like turkeys. (See next page.) 

The sauce for roast fowl may be either plain melted 
butter, or gravy sauce, or, what is still better, a sauce 
made as follows : — Cut the neck io pieces, and stew it 



34 DIRECTIONS 

gently' till its juice is extracted ; — thcD take out the 
pieces, strain the liquor, stir into it a piece of batter 
rolled in flour, add some mushroom ketchup^ and boil 
it for half a minute. 

Turkeys are trussed in the same manner as fowls, 
only using one or two more skewers if required. The 
stuffing for roast turkey is generally the same as for 
fillet of veal (see p. 27) ; to which may be added, if de- 
sired, parboiled sausage meat, grated ham, or chopped 
oysters. This is placed under the skin at the neck, 
which must be well secured, leaving room, however, for 
the stuffing to swell. The breast ought to be covered 
with writing paper, well buttered, and the roasting done 
before a good large fire, — not too near. Shortly before 
taking it away from the fire, remove the paper, shift 
the turkey closer to the fire to become browned ; dust 
it with fiour, and baste it with butter to prevent its 
getting scorched. A sauce may be made from the neck, 
as for fowls — (see p. 33.) Bread sauce, gravy sauce, 
oyster sauce, and egg sauce, are also occasionally used. 

Pigeons are roasted with the feet on, one leg being 
thrust through a slit made in the other. They are 
stuffed with the liver minced and mixed with bread- 
crumbs, chopped parsley, pepper and salt, and a little 
butter. Half an hour's roasting is sufficient, during 
which they must be well basted with butter. The sauce 
for roast pigeons may be either plain melted butter 
with a little chopped parsley in it, or one made as above 
from the giblets — (the neck, liver, and gizzard.) They 
are sometimes served with toasted bread beneath them 
in the dish, and with bread sauce. They may also be 
garnished with fried bread crumbs. 

Partridges are roasted with both the head and the 
feet left on. The neck is twisted round the wing so as 
to bring the head to the side of the breast. Otherwise 
they are prepared and trussed in the same manner as 
fowls, only their feet are made to cross on the lower 
part of the breast. While roasting, baste them vnith 
butter ; and when nearly cooked, dredge them lightly 



FOR ROASTING. 35 

with flour, and continue to baste till they are browned 
They are serred on toasted bread soaked in the con- 
tents of the dripping pan. The sauce may be either 
plain melted butter or beef gravy. 

Pheasants, Grouse, and Blackcocks, are roasted and 
SjBryed in the same manner. So also are Woodcocks 
and Snipes, but these latter are generally not drawn ; 
the trail, as the drippings from the entrails are called, 
being receiyed upon toasted bread placed in the drip- 
ping pan beneath. This is considered a delicacy, and 
is served in the dish under the bird. 

Goose, This is best drawn at an incision made be- 
tween the vent and the tail. The legs and wings are 
lopped at the first joint, and the remaining parts 
skewered flat to the sides. The liver and gizzard are 
not usually roasted along with it, but are reserved, along 
with the head, neck, feet, and pinions, for a stew or a 
giblet pie. A mixture of chopped onions and skge- 
leaves (six of each will do), and a little butter, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, grated nutmeg, and a little sugar, i^ 
placed inside the bird, through the opening by which 
it was drawn. A button-hole is then made in the skin 
of the belly, or apron as it is called, by cutting out the 
vent, and into this, the apron being pulled downwards, 
the rump or croup is inserted as a button. The neck- 
skin being then securely tied, a piece of buttered 
paper is tied over the breast, and the goose hung before 
the fire. In a short time remove the paper, and baste 
the goose with its own dripping, of which there will 
generally be sufficient. Being naturally greasy, it does 
not need so much basting as turkey or fowl. It re- 
quires thorough cooking, which will be accomplished 
in about two hours, more or less. Serve it with beef 
gravy if required. Apple sauce is the prescriptive ac- 
companiment of roast goose. 

The above stuffing is thought by some to be improved 
by being stewed in butter till tender, and then placed 
inside the goose whilst hot. It is sometimes varied by 
the addition of the liver chopped, and bread crumbs, or* 



36 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

boiled rice, or masbed potatoes, or a mixture of potatoes 
and apples (previously cooked and reduced to a pulp), 
or sometimes even roasted cbesnuts cut small 

Ducks, The feet, wbicb are left on, are scalded in 
boiling water, and then skinned. They are turned 
flat upon the back like the winga Otherwise, dncki 
are prepared in the same way as geese, the liver being 
used in the stuffing. Being smaller, they require less 
time to roast. A gravy may be made for them, as for 
fowls, from the giblets. Apple sauce is served with 
them. Some prefer them plain roasted like fowla^ 
without stuffing ; in which case the apple sauce may 
also be omitted. Green pease are usually served with 
roast ducks. 



CHAPTER VI. 

Boiiiiira. 



0£NERAL DIRECTIONS. 

The practice of this most important branch of the 
culinary art seems at first sight so simple and ^»y, 
that any general directions for it may perhaps appear 
unnecessary. Yet it is doubtless this apparent sim- 
plicity which has led to its being generally so ill done, 
that, excepting for the larger prime joints, it is com- 
paratively neglected by all who can afford to purchase 
roasting pieces. 

The two grand errors which prevail on the subject 
of boiling fresh meat are — Ist, Putting it into cM 
water, and gradually heating it to the boiling point ; 
and 2(/, Maintaining it in a state of brisk ebullition 
until cooked. The former of these is almost universali 
heing actually recommended in most cookery books. 
The latter is an error generally acknowledged, although 
it is too frequently committed through inattention or 
ignorance. When these errors are considered in con- 
nection with what has been said in Chapter IV. oa the 




FOR BOIUNO. 37 

chemical nature of animal flesh, their necessary results 
will be evident ; and these are fully confirmed by ex*- 
perience. The evil arising from the first error, is the 
loss of the juice and the flavour of the meat. The juice 
being entirely soluble in water below 1 40o, as soon as 
the meat is immersed in it, there begins a gradual pro- 
cess of transposition between the juice of the meat and 
the water, and this goes on until checked by the co- 
agulation of the albumen within the meat, which takes 
place when it has attained the above-mentioned tem- 
perature. But by this time, especially if the fire has 
been slow, the meat will have lost a great part of its 
savoury juice, of which the scum which now rises is 
the albumen, and what remains has been rendered thin 
and watery. Now commences error the second. The 
beat increases, — the water simmers, — it boils fast. The 
muscular fibre of the meat soon begins to contract, — 
it forcibly presses upon the imprisoned fluid ; the co- 
agulated albumen confining it, having been rendered 
less tenacious by previous dilution with water, gives 
way^ and the remaining juice gushes out at every pore. 
The meat is now considered to be well cooked. It may 
perhaps be found tolerably tender, but it will be both dry 
and tasteless. A few minutes more boiling would have 
made it tough as well. These results are not so observ- 
able in large pieces of meat, more especially those which 
like a leg of mutton have the greater portion of their 
surface covered by the natural skin, because from their 
size it is possible to make the water boil before it has 
time to penetrate very deeply, while the skin greatly 
helps to keep in the juice. Smaller pieces, on the con- 
trary, which have a proportionally larger raw or cut 
surface, are sure to lose almost all their juice when thus 
treated. Of course the liquor in which meat has been 
thus boiled will make excellent broth or soup, as perhaps 
every housewife knows ; but since well-flavoured, tender 
and juicy meat, and not broth or soup, is the main 
object in boiling meat, a very diflerent course ought to 
be followed. 



38 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

The meat should he plunged at onee into waUr MZ- 
ing briskly over a strong fiit. The water should be 
slightly salted, and be in sufficient quantity to ooYer the 
meat. The boiling heat mil at once coagulate the al- 
bumen, and harden the fibrine at the suffaceofthemetd, 
and so, from the first, the escape and dilution of the juice 
is checked. After the lapse of from five to ten minutes, 
according to the size and compactness of the piece of 
meat, the heat must be reduced considerably below the 
boiling point, by the addition of cold water. The fire 
may then be moderated, and the pot so placed that the 
meat will never afterwards be subjected to a greaJUit 
heat than that of gentle simmering. Should any sonnl 
be formed, it must be removed. Keep the pot covered 
to prevent dust and smoke entering it. If the quantity 
of water becomes much reduced by evaporation, the pot 
must be replenished with liot water. When vegetables^ 
such as carrots or turnips, are boiled along with meat^ 
they are sliced and put in when the meat is nearij 
cooked, after which the water may be allowed to boO, 
but no longer than is just necessary to cook the vege- 
tables. As this cannot be done, however, without some 
risk of impairing the goodness of the meat, it is safer 
to boil the vegetables separately. Some cooks recom- 
mend wrapping the meat up tightly in a floured cloth. 
But although this practice may perhaps assist in pre- 
serving the juice when the meat is put on in cold water, 
still it gives it a disagreeable blanched appearance, and 
it will not be found necessary when the meat is put 
into boiling water at first. The liquor in which meat 
has been boiled properly, although not so rich in juice 
as that in which it has been boiled improperly, will still 
make very good soup, with the addition of trimmings 
and scraps of meat, raw or cooked meat bones, 4&c. As 
all varieties of fresh meat are boiled as directed above, 
little more will be requisite than to enumerate the best 
joints and pieces for the purpose ; although it must be 
understood that any piece of meat of moderate size and 
compact shape will be very good boiled, if the above 
directions are carefully attended to. 



FOR BOILING. 30 

Salted meat which has lain long in pickle (moi^ 
particularly tongue and ham) is an exception to the 
foregoing rule. It is best put into cold water. • Not 
only so, but it frequently requires to be soaked forbonfs 
in cold water previous to being boiled, both to extract 
the superabundance of salt, and to impart moisture suf- 
ficient to replace what was extracted in the process of 
salting, as well as what has dried up afterwards. No 
doubt much of the savoury juice of the meat- is thiis 
extracted, but this cannot be helped, and is not of so 
much consequence, since its absence is disguised by the 
^tness. Beef which has been but a short time in salt, 
especially if it be a small piece, may very safely be put 
on in boiling water, and is much better so cooked. 

The time required to cook boiled meat dependS) of 
course, on its weight and compactness of shape. Gene- 
rally, from a quarter of an hour to twenty minutes for 
each pound is sufficient. In lifting meat out of the 
pot, care should be taken to avoid thrusting the fork 
into any fleshy part, as, in some joints, this would make 
unseemly holes, by which much of the gravy would es- 
cape before it could be brought to table. Perhaps it 
may hardly be necessary to remark that all vessels used 
for boiling ought to be perfectly clean. 

BBBr. 

Boiled Fresh Beef or BouUli is not so generally liked 
as it ought to be. This is probably owing to the dry, 
tasteless condition in which, through ignorant cold- 
water cooking, it is genersdly presented at table. The 
want of the juice in the meat is but ill supplied by its 
being served in a flood of the watery liquor in which it 
•was boiled, — by way of gravy. When the broth is re- 
quired on the same day as the meat, which is the ge- 
neral custom, the following is the best plan to adopt. 

Procure from four to six pounds of the rump or bris- 
ket of beef, — almost any part will do if it is good and 
tender, — and cut about one quarter of this into thin 
slices, choosing for this purpose any sinewy or loose out- 



40* DIRECTIONS 

«ide parts, so as to leave the remainder of a solid eom- 
pact shape. Having well hacked and scored these slioes 
across, put them on in as much cold water as is intended 
be employed (rather less than a quart to each pound 
of the whole meat will do), and let them heat verjslowlj 
to extract the juice. When this is thoroughly accom- 
pltshed, add salt to taste, skim the liquor, and then make 
it boil. While boiling fast, put in the rest of the meat, 
together with some sliced carrot, turnip, onions^ and 
leeks, and proeced as directed above. When the meat 
is nearly cooked, take it out for a short time while the 
vegetables are boiled. Allow it to go off the boil again, 
replace the meat, and let it simmer for a few minutes. 
Dish half the carrots and turnips round the meat, along 
with some of the liquor, and put the rest of the Tege- 
tables, cut smaller, into tbe tureen along with the broth, 
to which toasted bread cut into small dice may be added 
if desired. Before sending to table, skim the superflu- 
ous fat from the broth. Of course, the exhausted slices 
of meat must not be sent to table in their present state. 
The quantity of vegetables used must depend on the 
taste of the cook ; — three large carrots, four tnmips, 
two large leeks, and three onions, to six pounds of meati 
is a very good proportion. When the broth is not re- 
quired on the same day, the meat may be cooked entire, 
proceeding exactly according to the foregoing General 
Directions, but not omitting the vegetables. The French 
pot aufev, in which they make their bouilli, is of ttane^ 
warty which has the advantage of maintaining a mors 
equable temperature, losing less heat by radiation than 
an iron vessel does, and consequently requiring a smaller 
consumption of fuel. 

Salted Beefy with its appropriate vegetables, is a 
much more general favourite than the bouilli ; and of 
all the pieces which may be used, the Round is the most 
approved. A whole round, being generally too large 
to boil at one time for a small household, may be di- 
vided, so as to give each piece its due proportion of fitt, 
into two, or even three pieces, and these boiled at aepa- 



FOR BOILING. 41 

rate times. When the whole is boiled at once, the bone 
may be cut out. Wash the meat well, and if it is too 
salt, it may require steeping in several waters till fresh- 
ened. Fasten the folds of it firmly together with skewers 
and strong broad tape or strips of linen, and then put 
it on the fire in water sufficient to cover it. If the meat 
is but newly salted, the water should be boiling; if it 
is rather salt, cold water is better. In the former case, 
proceed exactly as with fresh meat ; in the latter, heat 
the meat gradually till it begins to boil, after which, keep 
it slowly simmering till cooked. The time required is 
about a quarter of an hour to each pound of meat. 

The vegetables taken along with salt beef (carrot, tur- 
nip, and greens) are always best boiled in some of the 
same liquor, which must be removed for this purpose 
after the meat has simmered about two hours — of coursjp 
leaving enough to keep the meat covered. The vege- 
tables may be farther enriched by adding the fat skim- 
mings of the meat to their liquor. When the vegetables 
are cooked in the same pot with the meat, there is al- 
ways a risk either of having the former under-done, or 
the latter over-done, unless the meat is removed while 
the vegetables are boiled. 

The beef, freed from its fastenings, is dished along 
with some of the liquor, and garnished with the carrot 
and turnip. (Some omit the turnip.) The greens are 
served separately. The liquor is excellent for making 
peas-soup. 

A round of beef is very good cold, and will keep 
good for a fortnight in cold weather. It should be kept 
covered with a soft clean cloth thickly folded, and a 
dish-cover over that. When not intended to be used 
warm, it is a good plan to cool it as rapidly as possible 
by plunging it into iced or cold spring water before re- 
moving the fastenings — changing the water frequently. 
This congeals the gelatine and fat on the surface, and 
so preserves the juice, which is very apt to drain out 
when it cools slowly. 

The salted Eibs^ Brisket, and Edge-hone, are also 



42 DIRECTIONS 

cooked and senred as above ; only, being less solid, thej 
are done in about fiv6-sixths of the time for the same 
weiojht. 

Collared heefBXi^ Pressed heef, prepared according to 
receipts, are cooked in the same way ; only, being bound 
up in a compact shape, they require a rather longer time 
to cook. Though collared beef may be served hot, like 
-other salt beef, yet these are generally preferred cold, 
a weight being placed upon them while cooling, in 
order to make them firm and compact for slicing. 

A PicJded Ox-tongite is put on in plenty of cold water 
" brought to the boil," and then simmered till tender, 
which is ascertained by probing it in the thickest part 
with a fork. A dried tongue requires twenty-four hours 
previous soaking, more or less, according to dryness and 
saltness. Salt tongue is generally eaten along with the 
more insipid meats, such as veal, poultry, &c. It should 
be skinned before serving. 

Tripe should be chosen fat, thick, and white. It 
requires very careful washing and scraping, scalding it 
frequently, and changing the water often. It will take 
from six to nine hours, or even longer, slow simmering, 
according to the age of the animal from which it was 
taken. When perfectly tender, remove it from the 
liquor, cut it into pieces of a convenient size for helping 
at table, and then simmer it in milk and water, along 
with some young onions previously parboiled. When 
the milk and water begins to thicken, add some arrow- 
root mixed with a little cold water, or a piece of butter 
rolled in fiour, season with pepper and salt, and, if liked, 
'a little made mustard, — and serve in a hash dish or small 
tureen. 

' This makes an excellent supper dish, along with boiled 
potatoes. Some people use a little of its own liquor 
instead of the milk and water, but the latter will be 
found much preferable. Tripe may be bought ready 
. cooked at the cook-shops, but the last preparation with 
milk and water is best done at home. 

Cow-heels or One feet should be procured ready cleaned. 



FOR BOILING. 43 

They are considered very nutritious when thoroughly 
cooked. They should he sipimered till the hones he- 
come loosened, and served hot with plain parsley sauce 
poured over them, or plain melted hutter with a tea- 
spoonful of made mustard and a very little vinegar or 
lemon juice in it. 

Cow-heel, while cooking, yields a very rich oil, which 
must he skimmed off. This is sometimes used for fry- 
ing and hasting. It hums well in a lamp, and is said to 
he used hy the perfumers in some of their preparations 
for the hair. The liquor may he turned to account in 
making calves-foot jelly ; — for which ox feet are much 
hotter adapted than calves' feet. 

MVTTOir. 

The Leg or Gigot is the prime joint for hoiling. Cut 
the end off the knuckle, and cook the leg, according to 
the General Directions, in an oval vessel or fish kettle. 
Boiled turnips and carrots in slices are usually served 
in the same dish with hoiled mutton ; or the turnips 
may he mashed, and served separately. When cooked 
in the same pan, these are put in to hoil half an hour 
hefore the mutton is done, the meat heing meanwhile 
removed and replaced when the vegetables have hecome 
soft. The liquor should be reserved for making broth 
next day. 

The Neck of mutton, and the Back Rihs, are boiled 
in the same way as the leg. It is a very good family 
practice to make broth at the same time, as the in- 
gredients do not at all spoil the meat. For this pur- 
pose the barley or rice is put into the boiling water along 
with the meat. After an hour and a half's simmering) 
the meat is removed and covered up to be kept warm, 
while the vegetables in small slices (carrots, turnips, 
and onions, with chopped parsley, and celery or celery- 
seed) are put in and the liquor boiled till considerably 
reduced in quantity. The meat is then replaced, and 
•the cooking finished in the usual way. Some of the 
;carrots and turnips may be kept in large slices with 




44 DIRECTIONS 

which to garnish the meat when dished. Cauliflower 
may be served with boiled mutton. Caper or gherkin 
sauce may either be poured over it in the dish, or 
senred separately in a sauce-boat. Parsley-sauce poared 
over the meat is by some preferred to caper sauce. 

VBAL. 

The parts most usually boiled are the Chump of the 
Loin, the Best End of the Neck, and the KnucJde, These 
require to be thoroughly cooked. Thick parslej-sauoe 
may be poured over them or served separately ; onion 
sauce is also used. These insipid gelatinous meats are 
much the better of an accompaniment of boiled salt 
tongue, ham, or bacon. The liquor of boiled veal makes 
a very delicate broth, rice in gelatine. 

LAMB. 

The Leg is treated in the same way as a leg of mutton, 
but being smaller, it does not require so long a time to 
cook. It may be dished with spinach under it ; or the 
loin (being the remainder of the hind quarter) may be 
cut into chops, and these fried and served in the dish 
round the leg. Plain melted butter, and parsley sauce, 
are the sauces generally used. 

roBS. 

Pork should be thoroughly cooked, and ought pre- 
viously to have lain in salt from two days to a week at 
the least, according to the size of the piece. The Leg 
of pork should be placed in the pot with the skin-side 
uppermost, and with a plate upderneath it to prevent its 
sticking to the bottom. While simmering, it throws up 
a great deal of fat, which should be constantly skimmed 
off. It is served with pease-pudding boiled in some of 
the liquor, greens, mashed turnips, or parsnips. 

PiMed Pork is cooked and served in the same man- 
ner. The following is a pleasant variation in the mode 
of serving a Pig*$ Cheek (pickled.) While the cheek is 
being cooked, boil for half an hour half a pint of split 



FOR BOILING. 45 

peas loosely tied in a cloth ; remoye them from the 
cloth, mash, and pass them through a hair sieve ; sea- 
son them with pepper and salt, and add an ounce of 
butter and four beaten eggs j place them in a stew-pan 
oyer the fire, and keep stirring till the eggs begin to 
set ; then, when the pig's cheek, cooked till perfectly 
tender, is dished, spread the peas over it, sprinkle the 
top with bread crumbs, and brown it before the fire. It 
should be served immediately. The liquor of boiled 
pork, if not too salt, will do very well to make peas- 
soup, but does not answer for anything else. 

Ham. A ham may be boiled either whole or in parts 
The best English hams are from York andWestmoreland. 
A most important point in cooking ham is the soaking, 
the length of time required for which (from ten hours 
to three or four days) must be properly proportioned to 
the saltness and dryness of the ham. Before .cooking 
it, the ham should be well scraped and washed in warm 
water, and any yellow or rusty parts pared off. It should 
be put on in cold water, allowed slowly to reach the boil- 
ing point, and then simmered from two to four hours 
according to size, frequently skimming off the fat which 
continually rises. When done, skin it neatly and strew 
oyer it a few bread raspings mixed with a little brown 
sugar ; then place it before the fire to dry and become 
browned. Serve it garnished with parsley, and with a 
paper frill fastened round the knuckle. When eaten 
hot, it is generally as a relish with other meats. Boiled 
ham will keep even longer than a round of beef, and is 
a most serviceable article to have in the house. It 
should be kept covered with the skin, wl^ich must be 
preserved whole for this purpose when taken off. 

Bacon, well streaked, and not too fat, should be put 
on in cold water and simmered for an hour and a half, 
more or less, according to its size. It is served with 
broad beans round it, or young peas when in season. 

RahWB, These may be boiled whole as follows. Wash 
them well in warm water, and dry them. Fill the belly 



46 DIRECTIONS 

with a stuffing made of bread crumbs, suet, parsley, and 
onions, all chopped small, seasoned with pepper and suit, 
and bound together with an egg and a little milk. Sew 
up the belly, truss in the same way as roast hare, and 
simmer gently for an hour. AVhen dished, pour over 
them a sauce made of milk and onions thickened over 
the fire with a paste of butter and fiour, and seasoned 
with pepper and salt ; — the onions being previously 
boiled in water till tender. This dish is called rabbits 
fmoiliered in onions. The stuffing, if not desired, may 
be omitted. When two are prepared in this way, they 
are dished with the head of one rabbit laid to the tul 
of the other. Instead of the onion sauce, a sauce made 
of some of the liquor in which the rabbits were boiled, 
enriched with yeal gravy, and the livers boiled and 
mashed, — thickened with flour and butter, — and sea- 
soned with pepper, salt, allspice, and finely chopped 
parsley, may be poured over the rabbits. 

Foioh and Turkeys which have been plucked, drawn, 
and cleaned in the same way as for roasting, are trussed 
for boiling as follows. The legs are secured by being 
drawn inside under the skin. The pinions are turned 
round upon the back, the liver being placed under one, 
and the gizzard under the other. The legs and wings 
may be farther held down by strings tied over them 
round the body. Boiled turkey is always, and boiled 
fowl frequently, stuffed. The following is the mixture 
usually employed : bread crumbs, finely minced, suet 
and parsley, with pepper, salt, and nutmeg. This is 
moistened with an egg and a little milk, and placed in 
the breast ; and the skin is then sewed over upon the 
back, leaving sufficient room for the stuffing to swell. 
The bird is put on in water nearly boiling, and in 
sufficient quantity to keep it always covered. Fowls 
require to be simmered from half an hour to an hour 
and a half, and turkeys about double that time, accord- 
ing to their size and age : in all cases they should be 
tlforoughly cooked, as nothing is more disagreeable than 



FOR BOILINQ. 4T 

half-raw poultry. If it is desired that the bird should 
look very white, it may be wrapt in a floured cloth, 
before boiling; or simply rubbed with lemon juice, 
which answers the same purpose. The liquor will make 
excellent broth. This may be prepared for use the 
same day, the vegetables and some scraps of veal or 
mutton being put in along with the fowl, which will 
not be any the worse for them. Various sauces may 
be used : — egg sauce, parsley sauce, to which the liver 
boiled and bruised may be added if liked, celery sauce, 
lemon sauce,^and sometimes, for turkey, oyster sauce. 
When this last is selected, a few chopped oysters may 
be added to the stuffing. For turkey some people like 
a sweet stuffing made by substituting currants and a 
little sugar for the parsley. Boiled poultry, either hot 
or cold, is always more palatable if ham or salt tongue 
is eaten along with it. Several excellent made-dishes 
can be prepared from the cold remains of roast or 
boiled poultry. (See Chapter X.) 

Geese, Dttcks, BndGame Bird>8, are much better roasted 
than boiled. For boiling they are trussed in the same 
way as fowls. The sauce generally preferred for Geese 
and Ducks is onion sauce. Partridges, Pheasants, kc. 
are served with the same sauces as when roasted. 

rz8B. 

The flesh of fish is naturally so soft that it requires 
to be cooked at a boUi/n^ heat in order to make it firm. 
Being generally small in size as compared with joints of 
meat, it is proportionally more quickly cooked ; and the 
texture of the muscular tissues is so loose, and the gela- 
tinous parts are so easily dissolved, that every minute it 
remains in the liquor after being thoroughly done dete- 
riorates its quality. On the other hand, few things are 
so nauseous as underdone fish. Hence it is a matter of 
some nicety, to be learnt only by experience, to pro- 
portion the time of cooking to the size of the fish. As 
there is some danger, when the fish or piece of fish is 
large and thick, of its being over-cooked on the outside 




48 DIRECTIONS 

before the interior is done, the safer plan in such 
is to proceed as directed for boiling butcher meat, fia. 
to plunge it at once into boiling water, and then to eool 
it down 80 far bj the addition of cold water as to allow 
the interior time to become heated before the oatside 
is too much cooked. Smaller fish however are best kept 
at the boiling heat from the moment they enter the fidi- 
kettle till they are done, — the object being in all cases 
to perform the operation as rapidly as is consistent with 
its being done thoroughly. 

Hard water is the best for boiling fish in. It should 
have plenty of salt in it, and a little vinegar is sometimes 
an improvement. This assists the rapid coagulation of 
the albumen, which, in the case of fish, forms the curd 
which is deposited between the fiakes, and is esteemed 
a delicacy. The cruel practice of crimping cod and 
salmon — that is, gashing their sides while yet alive — oc- 
casions a more copious formation of this curd upon the 
cut surfaces ; as the juice of the fish oozes out over them 
and thickens by evaporation, so that it is coagulated 
the7*e and not within the substance of the fish, when it is 
plunged into the boiling water. The crimping also &- 
cilitates the rapidity of the cooking by admitting the 
boiling water to act upon the interior parts of the fish. 
This however may, if desired, be equally well effected by 
cutting the fish in slices before putting it on. All fish 
require thorough cleaning before being cooked ; care 
being taken, in gutting them, to avoid breaking the 
entrails, especially the gall-bladder, on account of the 
bad taste their contents communicate to the fish. The 
fins and thin part of the tail should be clipped off with 
scissors, and the eyes of the larger sorts taken out. 

Every kind of fish becomes so fragile when cooked, 
that great care is required in dishing it, to prevent its 
being broken or disfigured : on this account the use of 
the drainer should never be omitted. If the fish hap- 
pen to be ready before the time for serving it, it must 
on no account be allowed to remain in the water, but 
must be dished, covered with a doth and dish-cover, and 
kept hot over the fish-kettle. 



FOR BOIUNQ. 49 

Fish should be sent to table as dry as possible^ with 
a folded 'napkin under it in the dish.' Besides the 
sauces oommonlj used, many people take some of the 
liquor in which it was boiled. A sauce-tureen of this 
maj accordingly be sent to table along with it. Vine- 
gar, ketchup, essence of anchovieSi pepper, and cayenne, 
are usual condiments, and some people also use mus- 
tard. 

Salmon is best when perfectly fresh. It will however 
keep good for two or three days if kept very cool, Oir 
packed in ice. It should be well cleaned out, scaled and 
washed, and boiled in plenty of salted water. For large 
full-grown £bh when boiled whole, the time required 
may be about six minutes to each pound weight. It 
is best however boiled in pieces, the larger and thieker 
portions being put in first and boiled longest. When 
done, let it remain for a minute or two upon the 
drainer placed across the top of the fish-kettle, in order 
to let the water drip from it, and then dish the pieces 
together in their natural position, with a napkin under 
them. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. Serve 
with either lobster sauce, shrimp sauce, parsley sauce, 
or plain melted butter, — not omitting, however, a 
sauce-tureen with some of the fish-liquor for those who 
prefer it. Trouts are dressed whole, and served in the 
same manner. 

Cod, This fish, especially the tail part, is the better 
of lying for a day or two in salt before cooking j and 
before salting, it must be perfectly cleaned. It is boiled 
as directed above for salmon, garnished with.its roe, and 
served with ovster sauce or melted butter. The head- 
and-shoulders part is frequently, before being served, 
brushed over with %^g, sprinkled with bread crumbs, 
pepper and salt, stuck over with bits of butter, and 
browned before the fire. 

Haddocks and Whitings^ after being well scraped and 
cleaned, are put into boiling water well salted, and kept 
briskly boiling till done ; which will be in about twenty- 
five minutes, more or lesa» according to size. If they 

B 



50 DIRECTIONS 

are of different sizes, the large should be put in first. 
The heads are by some people esteemed a delicacj. 
Serve with melted butter and some of the liquor. 

Herrings and Mackarel are boiled in the same way, 
but not so long. Sauce, — plain melted butter ; or, for 
mackarel, fennel sauce or green gooseberry sauce. 

Turbot, ffallibutf Brill, and SoUs, These fish require 
careful cleaning and rubbing with salt, to remove the 
slime which exudes from them. - Cut an incision in the 
back, to give room for the fish to swell without bursting 
the breast skin. Lay it breast upwards on the fish 
drainer, and cook it in plenty of water into which has 
been thrown a handful of salt and a cupfiil of vinegar. 
As the skin of turbot is very apt to break and become 
unsightly under a brisk ebullition, this fish is merely 
simmered. Dish it breast upwards, garnished either 
with any small fish fried, or with parsley. Sauce, melted 
butter or any fish sauce that may preferred. 

Skate, This is the better of hanging for a day op two 
in the open air. It should previously be cleaned thorough- 
ly, rubbed with salt, and have the tail and fins cut off. 
When to be boiled, skin it on both sides, and cut it 
lengthways in strips an inch and a half broad ; roll up 
each piece and tie it with thread. Then steep them for 
three hours in a pickle of salt, vinegar, and water; 
after which boil them for about fifteen minutes in salt 
and water. Before serving, remove the threads, and 
serve with melted butter or caper sauce, to which may 
be added, if liked, some of the liver boiled and bruised. 

Salted Cod and Ling. The black-skinned sort are 
said to be the best. Like salt meat, salt fish requires 
steeping till freshened. It should be put on the fire in 
cold fresh water and simmered till tender, — not boiled, 
as that would make it hard and thready. Dish it diy 
with a napkin underneath, garnished with plain boiled 
parsnips and parsley. Egg sauce is the appropriate 
sauce. Mustard is generally taken with salt cod. 

Salt and Eed Herrings sometimes require steeping 
before being boiled. Serve with mashed potatoes.

VBOBTABZJia 

Soft water is the best for boiling vegetables, and there 
should be plenty of it used for all vegetables except 
green peas and young spinach, the flavour of which 
would be to much weakened by a large quantity. With 
few exceptions they ought to be put on in boiling water 
and boiled till thoroughly tender. The colour of every 
kind of cabbage and greens will be better preserved by 
the addition of a very small quantity of carbonate of 
soda to the water. The time required for boiling vege- 
tables depends so entirely upon their age and size, that 
no definite directions can be given about it. The best 
way to ascertain when they are done is to feel if they 
are tender by running a fork into them. All vegetables 
should be thoroughly washed and freed from dirt and 
insects before boiling. 

Potatoes are best boiled in their skins. Being first 
well washed and cleaned, they are put on the fire in 
cold water enough to cover them, seasoned with salt 
They must not be allowed to boil too soon or too fast, 
else they will be done on the outside, and their skins 
will be burst before the inside is cooked. This is a 
frequent error^ and ought to be carefully avoided, for 
few things are so tantalizing as fine-looking mealy po- 
tatoes with raw hearts. They should be as nearly as 
possible all of one size (which may be contrived by sort- 
ing the stock laid in into two or three lots, according to 
size, and boiling those of each lot separately), so that 
that they may be all equally cooked ; otherwise, by the 
time the large ones are done, the smallest will perhaps 
be broken and dissolved. When sufficiently cooked, 
pour the water off them, and place them at the side of 
the fire with the lid half off to let the steam escape, so 
that they may dry. Before serving, peel them, first re- 
moving the eyes with the point of a small knife so as 
not to disfigure them. When sent to table, cover them 
with a large white napkin folded, in preference to a 
dish-cover, because it will keep them as hot, and not 



52 DIRECTIONS 

confine the steam, which spoils the potatoes. Old po> 
tatoes are sometimes the better of being pared and 
soaked some time in cold water before boiling. When 
to be mashed^ thev may be pared either before or after 
being boiled, — carefully removing the eyes and specks. 
After being thoroughly boiled, they are mashed so as to 
leave no lumps, adding some butter, a very little milk, 
salt and white pepper. Dish neatly in a warmed vege- 
table dish, score in diamonds on the top, and if desLred, 
brown before the fire. 

Turnips, Young ones ought to be peeled, not paro^ 
put on in plenty of boiling water with salt in it, and 
boiled till tender. Older turnips must be pared, taking 
off all the woody outside, sliced as required, and boiled 
as above. When cooked, drain the water thorough^ 
from them, dish them, and pour some melted butter 
over them. Turnips may be mashed after being drained 
Press them through a colander with a wooden spoon, 
to keep back all lumps, and re- warm them in the sauce- 
pan, stirring in some fresh butter ; season with salt, 
pepper, and a little powdered ginger. Dish them neatly, 
ornamenting the top with a diamond pattern. — ^Younff 
turnips are never mashed. 

Carrots and Parsnips should be well washed and 
scraped, and boiled like turnips till soft. Young ones 
may be served whole, but large ones must be cut in 
quarters lengthwise. They are served with boiled meat 
either as a separate dish or as a garnishing. Parsnips 
are sometimes mashed like turnips. 

Beetroot may also be used for the same purposes, bat 
it must merely be washed, and not cut up till after 
being boiled, else it will lose its fine colour. 

Greens, Cabbages, and Savoys must be well -washed, 
the coarse outside blades removed, the stalk cut off 
close to the bottom, and all dirt and insects carefullj 
removed from between the leaves. The larger oneB 
may be cut into quarters and the smaller ones into 
halves, Ifave boiling enough of water to cover tbem ; 
throw into it a little salt and a very smleJl quantitj of 



FOR BOILINO. 53 

carbonate of soda. When these are dissolved^ put in 
the greens and boil them till tender. When done, 
place them between two plates and squeeze the water 
out of them. Dish them compactly in a yegetable dish, 
cut the whole mass as it lies in the dish, through and 
through, into dice of a convenient size for helping at 
t^ble, and serve hot. When greens are boiled along with 
a round of beef, they are better not drained, but served 
saturated with the beef liquor. 

Cauliflower and Brocoli require very careful cleaning. 
After removing the outside leaves, and trimming the 
tops of the others to a level with the heart, lay the ve- 
getables for an hour in salt and water, and then rinse 
them in a stream of water allowed to run from the stop- 
cock, to clean out the interior thoroughly. Boil as di- 
rected for cabbages, and when tender, drain them. Dish 
them neatly without breaking, and serve either plain 
or with melted batter or brown sauce poured over them. 

Green Peas should not be shelled till immediately 
before being boiled. Use no more water than will just 
cover them. When it is boiling, throw into it some 
salt, and, if the peas are not very young, a little sugar; 
then put in the peas and boil till quite tender, but not 
too long, or they will burst and dissolve. Drain them 
in a colander, and when dished stir gently among them 
a small piece of butter and a little pepper. Serve them 
quite hot. Sometimes a few sprigs of mint are boiled 
with the peas, for those who like the flavour of it. 

French Beans, Scarlet Runners, and Young Kidney 
Beans, Cut off the tops and tails, drawing off the tough 
backnstring, and cut the pods in pieces slantingly, or 
if large split them lengthwise and then divide them 
across. Lay them for half an hour in salt and water. 
Put them into boiling water with a little salt and car- 
bonate of soda to preserve their colour, and boil till 
tender. Then drain, and dish them; sprinkle them 
with salt and pepper, and lightly stir in a little butter. 

Brussels Sprouts are boiled and served in the same 
way. About forty small ones make a good-sized dish. 



54 DIRBCTIONS 

Spinach, This requires careful picking and washing 
in several waters. It should be boiled brisklj in salt 
and water. Ten minutes' boiling will make it tender. 
It is then drained on a sieve, pressing it lightlj to re- 
move the water. It is next beat up in a stew-pan 
placed over the fire, with butter, pepper, and salt, to 
which a little broth may be added. It should be dish- 
ed quite hot, the top being smoothed and neatlj scored 
in diamonds. A more tasteful method is to press it 
nto a leaf-shaped mould, and turn it out into the dish. 
Very young spinage should be boiled with no more 
water than what adheres to it after washing. 

Windsor or Broad Beans, SheU and wash them, and 
if old, skin them. Put them on in boiling water, with 
a little salt, and boil till tender. When not used as 
an accompaniment to pickled pork or bacon, thej are 
served with parsley-sauce poured over them. 

White Harricot Beans, Egyptian or Gabanza Beatu^ 
and Lentils. These being hard and dry, must be al- 
lowed time in cooking to absorb moisture and become 
softened. The larger kind of harricots even require 
some hours soaking in cold water. Put them on a slow 
fire in plenty of cold water with a little salt, a yery 
little carbonate of soda if the water is hard, and a bit 
of butter. They should be heated gradually, and nm- 
mered till tender, which may take about three honn 
in the case of the beans, and rather less for the lentila 
Then drain them, and serve with a little butter, pepper 
and salt, and sugar, stirred among them. Or ^hey 
may be treated as follows : — Fry a sliced onion ijU 
brown, in a stew-pan with a little butter, to which add 
the boiled seeis, a little more butter, some flour, and 
gravy or strong soup ; season with pepper and salt, stir 
them up, boil for ten minutes, and serve hot. 

Mice, after being well washed in two waters, most 
be thrown into salted water boiling quickly. When 
considerably softened but not quite tender, drain it^ 
and put it into a stew-pan which has been heated, and 
buttered on the inside. Close the' lid tightly, and 



FOR BOILING. 55 

place the stew-pan by the fire or in the oren till the 
cooking is finished,-^taking care not to let the ricd 
burn. Rice cooked in this way will be perfectly white, 
the grains being swelled to their full size, tolerably dry, 
not sticking together, and perfectly tender. Prepared 
thus to be eaten along with hash or curry, it may either 
foe served separately in a covered dish, or surrounding 
the curry in the same dish. A very nice mode of pre- 
paring it as an accompaniment to roast or stewed meat 
is, — to press it compactly into a buttered mould after 
draining it, and then to finish the cooking in the oven, 
or in a pot of boiling water, taking care that no water 
enters the mould. When turned out, this pudding will 
cut in firm solid slices. 

i\r. B, — The liquor in which any vegetables, except 
potatoes, have been boiled, may be used in making 
soup. Indeed the water of beans and lentils makes a 
very good soup maigre, with the addition of some onion 
fried in butter thickened with fiour and parsley, or any 
other flavouring herbs, vegetables, or seasonings that 
may be desired. ■ 

Bggs are placed gently in a pan of boiling water 
with a spoon, taking care not to let them knock against 
the bottom, which would crack them. A net or wire 
basket is preferable to a spoon, especially if a number 
are boiled at once. From three to four minutes boil- 
ing, counting from the time they are put in, will be 
sufficient for full-sized eggs, and a little less for small 
ones, — always remembering that perfectly fresh eggs 
take a little longer than others. They should always 
be covered with water. 

An improved method is to remove the pan from the 
fire immediately after the eggs are put in, and let them 
remain in the water about ten minutes. Or the boiling 
water may be poured gently over the eggs in a basin. 
Either way, if the quantity of boiling water is properly 
proportioned to the number of eggs, ten minutes im- 
mersion will cook them. Done in this manner, the 
yolk will always be thickened, while the white is just 



56 DIRECTIONS FOB BOILING. 

set and no more, being converted into a delicate white 
card much more digestible than the firm solid substance 
produced by the usual method. If too much water 
has been used, or the eggs are allowed to remain too 
long in it, the yolk will be found set firm, although 
the white will never be hardened ; and. if the quantity 
of water has been too small, the yolk will sometimes be 
set, while the white remains half raw. This shows thai 
the yolk is set at a lower temperature than the whiter 
the heat required for either being considerably lower 
than boiling. The quantity of water should be about 
half-a-pint to each eggy the pan being of such a size 
as to allow the water to cover the eggs. When done 
in a basin, a little more water will be required. This 
proportion of water must of course be considerably 
reduced where a large number of eggs are done at once, 
because the cooling of a large quantity of water is pro- 
portionally slower than that of a smaller quantity. 

Poached Eggs are prepared by breaking the shell and 
dropping the contents into boiling water with a little 
vinegar and salt in it. This should be done as dose 
as possible to the surface of the water for fear of break- 
ing the yolk and giving the white a ragged appear- 
ance when set, from its mixing too much vrith the 
water. For the same reason, the ebullition should not 
be too brisk. Perhaps a safer plan is to break each 
egg into a separate tea-cup, and immersing the cup in 
the boiling water, lower its lip so as to allow the water 
to enter and the egg to float out. By this plan also it 
is possible to examine whether the eggs are fresh or 
not, before they are put into the water. Care must be 
taken to allow one to set before another is put in, that 
they may not stick together, and to take them out in 
the order of their immersion. When the white is com- 
pletely set, the egg is lifted out with a small drainer, 
and the water allowed to drain from it for a minute. 
It is then ready for serving on hot buttered toast, or 
broiled or fried bacon or ham. There is an excelleot 
apparatus sold by tinsmiths for poaching egga. It con-

sisis of a frame holding several perforated shallow cups, 
each large enough to contain an egg. This is immersed 
in the hoiling water to the depth of the cups, into which 
the eggs are then dropped in the usual way. Thus the 
eggs are preserved from spreading through the water, 
and cooked in a more compact shape.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

Broilinq is the most expeditious mode of cooking. It 
is also one of the hest for meat that is in proper cook- 
ing condition ; ;hut for meat that is not, it is of all pro- 
cesses the worst. The reason is, that heing performed 
upon slices and not masses of meat, a high temperature 
is required to cook the meat before it becomes too much 
dried ; and this is of itself sufBcientlj apt to toughen 
the meat without the assistance of other unfavourable 
conditions. Broiling requires a strong glowing fir^ 
without flame or smoke. If the fire is not quite in this 
state, and there is no time to wait till it " bum through,*' 
the flame may be reduced and kept under by sprinkling 
salt upon the coals. The gridiron, which must always 
be kept clean and bright, should be first heated and 
then rubbed with a piece of suet before placing the 
meat on it ; — this prevents the meat sticking to it. The 
slices to be broiled should be cut of an even thickness, of 
not much less than three quarters of an inch, lest they 
be dried and hardiened,— nor more than an inch, else 
they will be still raw in the interior, while the outsidid 
is half burnt. The practice (recommended by some 
cooks) of beating them with the rolling pin, is decidedly 
a bad one ; it ruptures the juice vessels, and so occasions 
a loss of gravy. The article broiled, especially if it bo 



58 DIRECTIONS 

juicj, such as a beef-steak, should be turned yeiy fre- 
quently ; this process not only ensures its being cooked 
equally through on both sides, but prevents the expul- 
sion of the juice on the upper side. For turning the 
meat, a small pair of tongs made for that purpose is the 
best, a fork being sure to make holes by which the 
gravy is lost. Sometimes the gridiron is made double^ 
80 that the meat being held between its two flaps, which 
are fastened together by a hinge, the whole is turned 
together without removing the meat. This form of 
gridiron, however, although it certainly saves the labour 
of the cook, has the disadvantage of frequently making 
unseemly marks on the meat by the pressure of the 
bars, which also tends to squeeze out the gravy, and to 
render the meat hard. Another modification of the 
gridiron is one in which every bar is hollowed into a 
gutter to catch the gravy and fat, and prevent them 
dropping into the fire and there making a smoky blaze. 
This, however, necessitates the bars* being so broad as 
in a great measure to shelter the meat from that direct 
action of the fire which is essential to broiling. The 
best gridiron has small round bars, and is provided with 
a tin gutter along the front to catch the gravy ; and if 
the cook pays proper attention to the turning^ and 
places her gridiron aslant so that the fat runs down the 
bars into the gutter, or to the back of the grate if the 
gridiron has no gutter, very little gravy will be lost, and 
file will not be much annoyed by a blazing fire. 

An excellent method of broiling, well adapted for 
steaks, chops, fish, — in fact, for anything that requires 
to be quickly cooked, is performed with a flat tin dish 
upon which the article to be broiled is placed perpen- 
dicularly in front of the fire. This dish should have a 
couple of moveable hold-fasts, or a spring clip, like a 
letter-clip, to ^secure the meat or fish from dropping off, 
and its lower edge should be provided with a gutter to 
catch the dripping and gravy. It may also be made to 
slide towards and from the fire, upon a stout wire frame 
constructed to hook on to the front of the grate. The 



FOR BROILING. 59 

advantages of this method are : — 1st, That it can be 
employed when the fire may not be clear enough on 
the top, or sufficiently free from smoke and flame, to 
permit the use of the gridiron; 2d, That the annoy- 
ance of the fat dropping into the fire and making a 
blaze is avoided ; 3d, Any gravy that may exude from 
the meat while broiling is saved; and 4th, That less 
heat as well as moisture is lost from the side of the 
meat not exposed to the fire, this being covered by the 
back or bottom of the broiling dish. 

Broiled meat should be served and eaten the instant 
it is cooked, for every minute it stands deteriorates its 
quality; so that those who wish to dine upon meat 
broiled in perfection, must be content to wait a few 
minutes for their dinner rather than allow their dinner 
to wait for them. 

Beefsteaks, — Although those cut from the rump are 
considered the best, yet the sirloin or the spare-rib 
supply very palatable steaks if the meat is good and 
has been kept long enough. Having cut the steaks as 
above directed, trim off any superfluous suet, and di- 
vide them into pieces of a convenient size for serving 
at table. Sprinkle both sides with a mixture of pepper 
and salt, and broil according to the preceding general 
directions. The time required must vary according to 
the strength of the fire, the thickness of the steaks, 
and the taste of those who are to eat them, many per- 
sons preferring them rather underdone, while others 
like them to be thoroughly cooked. When finished, 
place them in a very hot dish, rub them with a little 
fresh butter, add a table-spoonful of mushroom ket- 
chup, and send them to table under a hot cover imme- 
diately. When steaks are broiled for a party of more 
than two persons, they should be sent to table in two 
or three separate supplies, so that they may be eaten as 
soon as dope, because if they are all served at once, those 
that are first cooked will have lost much of their good- 
ness while waiting till the last is finished. They may 
be garnished with a little scraped horse-radish. Mus- 



60 DIREOTIONl 

tard is the condiment almost uniTeradlj taken with 
beef steaks.. Pickles are sometimes used, but manj 
prefer oyster or mushroom sauce. Plain boiled poti^ 
toes and bread should not be omitted. 

JftiUon and Lamb Chops are best cut from the middle 
of the loin. They are also sometimes taken from the 
neck. They are cooked and serred in the same way 
as beef steaks. The buttering may be omitted in dish- 
ing, as the mutton is generally fat enough of itself. 
Mutton steaks from the back ribs, and cutlets from the 
gigot, may also be broiled as aboye. Before broiling 
these chops, it is a good plan, not always practised, to 
trim away unnecessary fat, and as much of the bone, 
especially the thick end of it, as can be neatlj taken 
away ; — there will thus be less troublesome dropping 
of grease into the fire, and the raw bone, as before ob- 
served, yields more juice for soup or gravy than a cooked 
one. Soger's Mutton or Lamb chop is sawn from the 
saddle; — the "jagging" of the meat by the saw, "caus- 
ing the chops to eat more tender," says its inrentor. 
Be this as it may, however, the idea is certainly good, 
as the chop exhibits a more equal distribution of £&t 
and lean than the ordinary one, and the undivided 
bone in the centre, assists in retaining the gravy. 

Veal Cutlets should be very well seasoned, and while 
broiling basted occasionally by dipping them in fresh 
butter melted in a plate. A more savoury method is : 
— having fried till brown some very finely chopped 
onion and parsley in a little butter, dip the cutlets 
first into this, then into bread crumbs seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and then broil them. Immediately 
before serving, pour over them a rich Brown Gravy 
thickened with butter and flour, flavoured with finely- 
minced orange-peel and some grated ginger, and made 
quite hot. 

Kidneys and Sweetbreads are sometimes broiled. The 
kidneys must first be split through the middle and laid 
open but not separated, and then strung upon skewers 
so as to keep them open and flat. Sweetbreads must 



FOR BROILING. 61 

be previously parboiled. Both should be highly sesk 
soned with pepper and salt before placing them on the 
gridiron^ and the sweetbreads are the better of being 
basted as above described for veal cutlets. Both may 
be rendered more savoury by first " egging" them, and 
then dipping them in a highly-seasoned mixture of 
bread-crumbs and finely-minced herbs, — sprinkling 
them also with the mixture while they are broiling. 

Pork Chops are perhaps the most indigestible of all 
forms of animal food. Those who have sufficient con- 
fidence in their gastric powers may try them. They 
are cut from the neck or loin, peppered, and jnust be 
thoroughly cooked. When done, serve them very hot, 
sprinkled with salt, or, if liked, a gravy flavoured with 
mustard and dry pulverised sage-leaves may be poured 
over them. Their appropriate condiment is mustard. 

Ham and Bacon. These, for broiling, ought not to 
( be too old or dry. Though every part of bacon is very 
good, the streaky part of the thick flank is the best. 
The slices need not be above a quarter of an inch thick. 
If rather dry, dip them for a minute or so in vinegar 
and water. The rind should be taken off, and each 
slice broiled for about Ave minutes, more or less ac- 
cording to the strength of the fire; during which time 
it should be turned three or four times. Serve them 
very hot. When poached eggs are served upon them, 
care should be taken to have both ready at the same 
time, as neither is improved by waiting for the other. 

Sausages, before broiling, should be pricked aU over 
with a pin, to allow the steam to escape without burst- 
ing them. They should be done over a slow fire, turn- 
ing them three or four times till of a nice yellow colour. 
Serve them very hot. ^___ 

Fowls and Pigeons, Being drawn, plucked, cleaned 
and trussed as for boiling, they are split down the back 
with a sharp knife, laid open, and pressed or beaten as 
flat as possible. If the fowl be large or old, the breast 
bone may be taken out, and also that of the rough part 



62 D1KBCTI0N8 

of the back. Season them plentifully all oyer with a 
mixture of pepper and salt, and broil them gentlj over 
a slow fire, giving the inside surface the first of the fire, 
turning them every five minutes till thoroughly cooked, 
and basting them occasionally with butter melted, ap- 
plied with a feather. When the flesh feels firm at the 
thickest part they are broiled enough. They then should 
have a fine golden yellow colour. Being thicker than 
chops or steaks, and requiring to be more thoroughly 
cooked, they require a longer time to broil, and must 
be done over a slower fire, or at a greater distance from 
it. Serve very hot, with parsley sauce, melted butter, 
beef gravy thickened, or mushroom sauce. Pigeons are 
sometimes broiled whole, in which case they are stuffed 
as for roasting, the stuffing however being rather more 
highly seasoned. 

JiabhitSy cut in quarters, may be broiled exactly as 
the preceding. _____^ 

Salnion, Slices cut from the thick part of the fish, 
previously cleaned and scaled, are dipped in flour^ and 
broiled over a clear fire. When done, rub them vrith a 
little fresh butter, and serve very hot, with caper sauce 
or any fish sauce that may be preferred. Kippered 
Salmon is broiled in slices the same way. 

Rizzared Haddocks and Whitings are general favou- 
rites for breakfast or supper. They are prepared by 
laying them in salt for twelve hours, more or less ac- 
cording to their size, after being well cleaned as for 
boUiDg, and then hanging them to dry in a cool airy 
situation, upon a rod run through the eye-sockets. 
They are broiled without seasoning, merely taking the 
heads off, but not skinning them as is sometimes recom- 
mended, for the skin, though uneatable, keeps in the 
juice. If the fish are large, it is as well to split and lay 
them open before broiling. These fish may also l^ 
broiled while fresh, but they are better cured as above. 
Serve hot, with some slices of fresh butter separate^ to 
be used with them by those who like it. 



FOR BROILING. 63 

Finnan Haddocks, These should be chosen of a mid- 
dling size, and not too stale. Before broiling, thej 
must be skinned ; and it is as well, since thej do not 
require very much cooking, to cut them in halves 
lengthwise, and to broil the thick and thin halves sepa- 
rately, otherwise the latter will be overdone before the 
former are cooked. Serve with fresh butter, as in the 
preceding receipt. (Finnan haddocks, if small, may 
also be cooked by pouring boiling water upon them in 
a dish and letting them lie in it for a minute or two. 
This last plan is a very good one for small dried fish 
which would be too much hardened by broiling.) 

Fresh Herrings and Sprats, after being well cleaned, 
are wiped dry with a cloth, then dipped in flour, and 
broiled over a moderate fire. For convenience, the sprats, 
being small, are stnmg in rows upon thin skewers run 
through their heads, and thus laid upon the gridiron. 
For sauce, melted butter with a little mushroom ketchup 
and vinegar or lemon juice in it, may be used. 

Bed Herrings are broiled plain, rubbed with butter, 
sprinkled with pepper, and served hot. If rather dry 
and salt, steep them for a short time before broiling. 
. Kippered Herrings are broiled and served hot, with- 
out sauce or any other seasoning than a little salt if 
they require it. 

Salt Herrings require soaking and cleansing. Wipe 
them dry, broil, and serve them like red herrings. 

Mackarely after being cleaned, should be split open 
and laid flat, rubbed with butter, sprinkled with pepper 
and salt, and then broiled. 

Trout are prepared in the same manner. Both trout 
and fresh herrings may be rizzared like haddocks, but 
should not lie in salt nor hang so long afterwards. 

Skate, if small, is very good broiled. It should be 
prepared as for boiling, wiped dry, sprinkled with flour 
and pepper and salt, and served with melted butter if 
a sauce is required.

CHAPTER VIII. 

FBYING. 



QENEBAL DIBEOnONS. 

This is as expeditious a process as broiling, and is ap- 
plicable not only to the same class of articles, bat like- 
wise to many odd pieces of cooked and uncooked meat, 
as well as vegetables, which could hardly be prepared 
in any other way. Hence it is considered, upon the 
whole, the more economical of the two. It is also^ »t 
least that mode of it distinguished by the French term 
SatUeVy the way in which a large class of preparations^ 
of which the common pancake may be called the type, 
are cooked. 

In one respect frying is similar to broiling : it is appli- 
cable only to small articles. And the reason of tlus is 
the same in both cases, — viz. that the heat employed 
is so great that it would infallibly char the greater part 
of a large article before the centre of it was half cooked. 
But in the case of frying there is a peculiar necessity 
for this high temperature ; for the medium by which 
it is applied (melted fat or oil), which is not by any 
means either palatable or digestible, would otherwisia 
penetrate the article fried, and destroy its good quali- 
ties. But this is prevented both by the crust or skin 
into which the heat hardens the surface of the article, 
and also by the repulsive force of the steam into which 
the moisture of the meat is converted the instant it 
comes in contact with the hot fat. 

The fat used in frying must be perfectly fresh, as 
the slightest rancidity will communicate its flavour to 
whatever is placed in it. Although butter or dripping 
are the best for butcher meat, and lard or oil for fish, 
yet good dripping will be found to answer very well 
for all sorts of animal food, and is generally the most 



FOR FRYING. 65 

economical ; — for pancakes <fec., butter only should be 
used. The butter will be found much less apt to burn 
if previously clarified from the traces of milk it con- 
tains by melting it in a jar placed in hot water, and 
pouring off the clear oil from the sediment which falls 
to the bottom. In frying by either mode, the fat used 
should not be stinted, and care should be taken to have 
it of a proper heat before putting the meat &c. into it. 
This heat may be ascertained by dipping into the fat 
the end of a small piece of bread : if the bread becomes 
slightly coloured and crisp immediately, the fat is hot 
enough ; if it is dark -coloured and looks charred, the 
fat has been made too hot. The evil arising from the 
fat not being hot enough is, that the meat will absorb 
some of it ; if it is too hot, the outside will be burnt 
before the interior is cooked. The same fat will serve 
many times if it be carefully prevented from burning, 
and separated from all traces of gravy or other impuri- 
ties every time it is set aside for future use. Fat which 
has been once used for fish should not be employed for 
anything else, as it retains the smell and flavour of the 
fish. 

The use of eggs and bread-crumbs for all kinds of 
steaks and chops, though generally considered unne- 
cessary and expensive, will be found to be a decided 
improvement, for two reasons : first, because the gravy 
is better preserved in the meat by the artificial skin or 
crust of coagulated egg; and secondly, because this 
egg crust being formed at a much lower temperature 
than is required to produce an equally efficient skin by 
hardening the surface of the meat itself, there is a 
smaller chance of the meat being hardened, and also of 
the dripping or butter being burnt. For fish, more 
especially where it has a large cut surface, eggs and 
bread crumbs are absolutely necessary to prevent that 
unpleasant absorption of the oil which the naturally 
loose texture of all fish might otherwise occasion. To 
apply this coverinjr, the article is first dipped into or 
smeared with well- beaten egg, and then rolled among 

F 



66 DIRECTIONS 

the crumbs of stale bread rubbed very small The 
coating should be thick and complete. Oatmeal is bj 
some people thought a very good substitute for bread- 
crumbs, especially for fish. All solid articles maj 
either be fried by complete immersion in the hot drip- 
ping, or sauteed (see page 17.) Pancakes, Omelettes, 
&c., of which eggs are the basis, are always saut6ed. 
Fish are best fried in the former method, being so apt 
to break when being turned while sautling. 

Beef'Steakiy Mutton and Lamb Chops, Veal Cutlets^ 
and Pork Chops, are all fried till of a £be light brown 
colour, following the above General Directions. When 
sauteed, the best gravy for them is made by pouring a 
little hot water into the frying-pan after they are re- 
moved, and, after pouring off the superfluous fat, adding 
a little pepper, salt, ketchup, and flour. A few sliced 
onions may be added to this sauce if liked ; they are 
put in and fried for a few minutes before pouring off 
the fat. When fried by complete immersion, which 
however is not the usual mode, a brown gravy thickened 
with flour may be required. In this case, however, a 
coating of egg and bread-crumbs is advisable. Such 
a covering may also be used in sautling, and it may 
be flavoured by the addition to the bread-crumbs of 
appropriate seasonings and herbs finely minced. Thus 
chopped parsley and lemon-peel, with pepper and salt^ 
may be used for veal cutlets ; and sage and onion for 
pork chops. The gravy for veal cutlets may be slightly 
acidulated with lemon-juice. Apple sauce is sometimes 
taken with pork chops. 

Minced Collops, seasoned with chopped onion, pepper, 
and salt, made into flattened balls or thick cakes, and 
then well dusted with flour, may be sauteed in butter 
or dripping. A sauce made by dredging a little flour 
into the pan after they are cooked, adding a little hot 
water or broth, and some mushroom ketchup, and 
simmering for a minute, may be poured over them. 

Kidneys, split open and laid flat, and highly sea^ 



FOR FRYING. 67 

soned with pepper and salt, are saut^ed in butter over 
a brisk fire. Thej should be thoroughly cooked, but 
not overdone. While saut^ing, chopped onion may be 
sprinkled over them. Serve them upon dry toast, in a 
fiat dish, with the contents of the pan poured over them. 

Sweetbreads, previously parboiled, and cut into slices, 
should be egged and rolled in bread-crumbs, which may 
be seasoned with lemon-peel, pepper, salt, and parsley. 
They are sautled in butter, and served with a sauce 
of melted butter seasoned with mushroom ketchup. 
They may be garnished with thin slices of fried bacon. 

Lamp's and Galfs Liver should be sliced, soaked in 
water, wiped dry, and fried as above. 

Tripe, previously boiled till tender, is wiped dry with 
a cloth, — dipped in a thickish batter made of egg», 
fiour, and milk, seasoned with milk, and, if liked, minced 
onion, — and fried in plenty of lard or dripping. When 
coloured light brown it is served hot, garnished with 
fried parsley. (Before frying this garnishing, the pars- 
ley being washed clean, should be thoroughly dried ; and 
when cooked, the fat should be well drained from it be- 
fore placing it in the dish). This is a very good method 
of cooking the remains of a dish of boiled tripe. 

Bacon, or Ham, and Eggs, This dish is a general 
favourite. It is prepared thus : — The ham or bacon 
should be evenly cut, not above a quarter of an inch 
thick, and the eggs carefully broken, so as not to rup- 
ture the yolks, each into a separate tea-cup. The ham 
is then sautded in a very little butter or dripping, care 
being taken not to harden it by over-cooking. When 
done, place it in a hot dish before the fire, and then 
cook the eggs in the fat that remains, slipping them 
gently out of the cups without breaking or spreading 
them too much in the pan. When the whites are just 
set, lift the eggs gently with a perforated slice and place 
them upon the ham in the dish, each upon a separate 
slice, and serve hot immediately. When bacon is 
saut^ed, its own fat will be sufficient to cook it in if it 
is good. The condiments to be placed on the table 



68 DIBECTIOXS 

with this dish are mnstArd, pepper, and vinegar. If 
preferred, the eggs may be poached instead of santeed, 
(see page 56 ) 

SansageSf before being fried, should be pricked in se- 
yeral places to permit the escape of the steam, which 
would otherwise burst them. It is an improvement to 
throw them into boiling water for a minute or two be- 
fore frying them. They may be served upon mashed 
potatoes, or upon toasted bread, with a garnishing of 
poached eggs, (see page 56.) Fried sausages are some- 
times employed to garnish roast turkey. 

A young Fowl or Chicken, prepared as for boiling 
(see page 46), may be sauted in butter, either with or 
without egg and bread-crumbs. When perfectly tender 
and of a rich golden tint, a sauce is prepared by pour- 
ing off the superfluous butter, dredging a little flour 
into the pan, adding a little boiling water, and a season^ 
ing of ketchup, pepper, salt, and a bouquet of parsley. 
Let the fowl simmer for a few minutes in this, then dis^ 
it, and keep it hot while the sauce is being reduced to 
a proper consistence ; then the parsley should be re- 
moved, a little lemon-juice added if liked, and the 
sauce poured over the fowl. In this sauce various kinds 
of vegetables, such as green peas, carrot and turnip, or 
cucumbers cut small, or a few mushrooms or sliced 
onions, may be stewed till tender, and the whole poured 
over the fowl when served. 

N. B. — If the fowl is large, it will be the better of 
being previously stewed or boiled, and cut up into 
smaller pieces. The bread-crumbs used in coveiing it 
may be seasoned to taste with nutmeg, pepper, salt, 
and minced parsley. 

Potatoes, cut in thin slices, are fried in plenty of 
dripping made rather hot. When dished, spriiikle 
them with salt. ■ 

FISH. For all kinds of fish, more particularly flat 
fish and the smaller sorts, frying is perhaps the most 
savoury mode of cooking. In every case, whether 
saut^ing or frying by complete immersion be the mode 



FOR FRYING. 69 

employed (the latter, if properly done, will be found 
the best), a good thick coating of egg and bread- 
crumbs should bemused. Haddocks, whitings, skate, 
and soles may be skinned before applying this covering 
to them, and eels must be so. In all other respects, 
and for every kind of fish, the modus operandi is that 
described in the following general directions : — 

Is^, If the fish^ or piece of fish, is large, such as a 
sole, the fat ought to be slightly cooled as soon as the 
outside coating has becQme sufficiently firm to exclude 
it, in order that the interior of the fish may be cooked 
without burning the surface. This may be done either 
by adding a little cold dripping to the hot fat, or by 
raising the pan farther from the fire. However, it will 
be found a better plan to cut the larger fish into fillets 
or slices, which is the form best suited to this mode of 
cooking. 

2d, If, in consequence of the fish being too wet, the 
egg and bread-crumbs will not adhere properly, the 
fish may first be rolled in flour. 

3^/, The fish should be placed in a stout iron-wiK 
basket having a handle, so that it can be immersed in 
the hot fat, held there till cooked, and then lifted out 
without the slightest risk of its breaking, which is the 
chief objection against saut^ing fish. 

4th, When fi&J^ are sauUed, they must be turned 
very carefully by means of a fiat tin slice, and oc- 
casionally raised from the bottom of the pan with the 
same instrument, to prevent their sticking to it and 
being burnt. Unless the greatest care is taken in the 
use of the slice, fish sauted will infallibly be broken, 
in which case they lose juice and absorb grease, and are 
greatly deteriorated. The same sauces are used with 
fVied fish as with boiled. 

Thin slices of Bread, cui into any fanciful form, and 
fried till crisp and brown in the fat which remains 
after frying any of the above, form a very useful gar- 
nishing for them .

CHAPTER IX. 

STEWIlfG. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

There are few branches of cookery, the thorough 
knowledge of which is so important to the housewife as 
that of stewing, both because of the large variety of 
dishes which may be produced by it, and also on 
account of its great economy. To the poorer classes 
this latter is of course its chief recommendation. Not 
only does this process play the chief part in the pre- 
paration of all those expensive ragouts And fi^iccusees in 
which the rich luxuriate, but, from its save-all and 
use-all capabilities, it is eminently suited to the less 
pretending meal of the artizan. Like roasting, it has 
the advantage of not abstracting any of the nutriment 
from the food prepared by it, besides which it possesses 
others peculiar to itself. By its means many of those 
inferior pieces of meat whose irregular shape and coarBe 
texture make it impossible either to roast or boil them 
satisfactorily, may be rendered not only tender and 
digestible, but, with the addition of a few inexpensive 
vegetables and seasonings, highly palatable. li also 
affords those whose means enable them to indulge in 
a small roast or boiled joint, an economical way of 
procuring a hot dinner out of the cold remains. 

Although the method of stewing of course Taries 
with the kind of food to which it is applied, yet these 
variations are perfectly consistent with and indeed 
rendered necessary by those General Principles detailed 
in Chapter IV. For example, in stewing raw meat it 



I 



FOR STEWING. 71 

is first saut^ed in the bottom of the stewpan (some cooks 
recommend half-roasting, but this must be attended 
with a greater loss of moisture), in order to seal up 
the surface so as to prevent the escape of juice, and 
then a small quantity of hot water, broth, or gravy, as 
the case may be, is added, in which the cooking is com- 
pleted by very slow simmering — not boiling — the lid of 
the stewpan being kept close shut down. The pre- 
liminary sauUing being intended merely to harden the 
surface of the meat, and by no means to cook it, must 
of course be carried no farther than is necessary to ac- 
complish that purpose ; it should therefore be rapidly 
done over a strong fire. Meat, on the other hand, 
which has been already cooked^ ought not to be 
saut^ed, because this would be useless, since all its 
albumen has been already coagulated. It should be 
placed at once in a warm gravy previously prepared, 
and merely heated in this without even simmering; 
because, having been already acted upon by heat, there 
is some risk of its becoming hardened by too high a 
temperature. The length of time required to cook 
meat by stewing, varies, of course, with the size of the 
pieces, and also with their texture, a coarse gristly 
piece requiring a longer time than a good fieshy piece, 
in order that its tendinous parts may become softened 
and partially dissolved. As regards time, however, 
this process has a peculiar advantage in the fact that, 
provided the heat be not made too great, there is little 
danger of the meat being spoiled by keeping it hot in 
the stewpan for some time after the cooking is com- 
pleted. The reason of this is, that the meat being con- 
tained with water in a close vessel, cannot be dried up 
as a roast would be ; neither can its juice be so thinned 
and rendered insipid as that of boiled meat would be, 
because the quantity of water employed is very consi- 
derably less. Hence stewing is the best mode of cook- 
ing for those whose hour of dining is uncertain. 

Ragouts and Fricassees differ from plain stews in this, 
that the gravy is enriched by the addition of various 



72 DIRECTIONS 

flayouring substances and seasonings. The meat in 
these cases is generally cut into pieces, so that it may 
more thoroughly imbibe these additional flavours. The 
ragout is the more highly seasoned preparation of the 
two, and is best adapted for the high-flayoured and 
dark-coloured meats. The fricassee, on the contrary, 
is more mild and bland in its favour, and being gene> 
rally composed of the white and delicate meats, its 
colour ought to correspond, — to ensure which the pre- 
liminary saut^ing of the meat must be very carefully 
jind delicately done, and the yolk of eggs and cream 
are added to the gravy. 

Rump, Brisket, and Shin of Beef, Each of uiese may 
be stewed in a single piece if not too large, simply as 
above described. Being sprinkled with pepper and 
salt, it is in the first place saut6ed with butter or drip- 
ping in the stewpan and frequently shifted so as to 
brown it on all sides, and prevent it from sticking to 
the bottom. A little water, slightly salted, is then 
added, in which it must stew slowly under a close 
cover ; the stewpan being occasionally shaken to per- 
vent its burning on the bottom, which may be farther 
guarded against by a few skewers laid under the meat. 
(N. B. The bone of the shin of beef should be sawn in 
three or four pieces.) Thus prepared, especially if the 
quantity of water used be very small, the stew will be 
not very unlike a roast, both in appearance and flavour, 
the latter being however decidedly stronger than that 
of roast meat. The water will be found converted into 
a rich gravy, which is of course served along with the 
stew. A Ragout is prepared by substituting broth, or 
a gravy made from the bones cut out of the meat for 
that purpose, instead of water, and using rather more 
of it ; and after the meat has stewed till nearly ready, 
adding sliced carrot and turnip cut in small slices, and 
shortly thereafter some onion and a seasoning of spices 
and sweet herbs according to taste. When the vege- 
tables are tender^ a little mushroom ketchup may be 



FOR STEWING. 73 

added to the grayj, ^hich is likewise thickened by the 
addition of a piece of butter rolled in flour. A rump 
of beef, dressed as abore, may be stuffed with a force- 
meat placed in the cavity formed by cutting out the bone. 
The ragout is served with the gravy poured over it. — 
Another mode is to cut the meat in neat slices before 
cooking it ; ih this case the preliminary saut^ing is of 
great importance. Sometimes balls of forcemeat (see 
p. 26) are added to the ragout in about ten minutes 
after the meat is ready, and celery is also used to 
flavour it, though this may as effectually be done by a 
little celery seed. Curry powder may also be intro- 
duced with advantage. This mode of stewing meat in 
slices will be found available for many of the coarser 
pieces, all that is necessary to render them tender 
being careful and long- continued simmering. To such 
ragouts (sometimes called Haricots), many persons add 
maccaroni or vermicelli, which require from ten to 
twenty minutes cooking along with the stew. 

Minced Oollops. Any piece of tender lean beef, freed 
from skin and gristle, is finely minced along with two 
or three onions, and seasoned with pepper and salt. 
This is sautled in a little butter in the stew-pan till 
slightly browned, being continually beaten and stirred 
about with a spoon during the process, to keep it from 
sticking to the bottom or forming lumps. A slight 
dredging of flour is then added, and immediately after- 
wards a little hot water, broth, or gravy extracted from 
the skin and gristle which have been cut away from 
the meat. A few minutes gentle stewing will now finish 
the process, when the mince may be dished with strips 
of toasted bread round it. 

N, B* Any odd scraps of already cooked meat, minced 
finely, and even the exhausted meat which has been 
used to make gravy or beef tea, may be mixed with this 
dish. These however must not be added until very 
shortly before serving, as they do not require cooking, 
but merely re-warming. 

Beef Olives consist of thin steaks spread over with a 



74 DIRECTIONS 

highly seasoned forcemeat, rolled up tightlj and tied 
with pack-thread. These are stewed and served in the 
osual way. 

Beef Kidneys, These are cut open, soaked in water, 
wiped dry and floured, and then stewed, after being 
slightly sauted in butter. The seasoning is generally 
minced onion and parsley, with pepper and salt, to 
which a little vinegar or onion-pickle liquor may be 
added if liked. The dish may be garnished with ^ed 
parsley. 

A Shoulder of Mutton may be stewed or ragoued pre- 
cisely as directed above for Rump of Beef The blade- 
bone may be cut out, and the cavity thus formed stuffed 
with forcemeat. 

A Haricot of Mutton or Lamb may be made of chops 
cut from the loin or back ribs, or in fact of any part 
which can be more conveniently cooked in slices than 
whole. Irish Stew is simply a haricot of mutton in 
which sliced potatoes and onions are the vegetable in- 
gredients. 

Veal, The best parts for stewing are the Fillet, the 
Breast and the Shoulder, These, especially the last, are 
the better of being stuffed as for roasting. For the 
preliminary saut^ing, butter should be used. The thick- 
ened sauce is improved by a slight seasoning of cayenne, 
salt, and lemon juice. 

Venison, On account of its dryness, this is Jbetter 
stewed than roasted. The Shoulder is stewed precisely 
as directed for the same part of mutton ; only it should 
be rather more highly seasoned, and a rich gravy made 
from mutton or beef may be used instead of water. 

Hare or Babbit must be washed and cut 'in pieces. 
After sautling in fresh butter, it should be gently stewed 
in a little water, or, what is better, some gravy prepared 
from the neck, head, liver, &c. The sauce should be 
thickened with flour, and the stew seasoned to taste 
with sliced onion, pepper and salt, and ketchup. Jugged 
hare is cooked as above, omitting the saut6ing, and in- 
stead of the stew-pan, using a closely covered earthen 



FOR STEWINO. 76 

jar, placed in a kettle of boiling water. Rabbits maj 
be fricasseed as directed below for chickens. 

Fowls and Pigeons may be stewed whole, trussed as 
if for boiling, and with either a stuffing, or simplj some 
butter and pepper inside. After being saut^ed, dust a 
little flour over them, then add some hot water or 
gravy, season them highly, and stew till tender. A 
very good dish may be made by using clear mutton 
or veal broth, seasoned with sliced onion, white pepper, 
and salty and when the fowl has stewed in this for about 
half an hour, adding a tea-cupful of clean well-soaked 
rice. When *this is tender, it must be drained from 
the gravy, and placed upon an inverted sieve before the 
fire to dry, the fowl being meanwhile kept hot. The 
fowl is then served with the rice piled in light heaps 
round it, and parsley-sauce poured over it. In this 
dish green peas and lettuce may be substituted for the 
rice. White cabbage also, cut as for pickling, is some- 
times used in the same way along with pigeons. To 
fricassee Chickens, they must be cut in pieces as when 
carved at table, and then these pieces are seasoned with 
white pepper and salt, and dipped in egg before being 
saut^ed. They are stewed very slowly in mutton or 
veal broth, seasoned with lemon-peel, onions, and a few 
sweet herbs. When the chicken is tender, the sauce is 
strained into a small clean saucepan, in which it is 
thickened with butter rolled in flour, and seasoned to 
taste with nutmeg. The yolks of one or two eggs, well 
beaten, and some cream, are then added to it, care being 
taken to mix these well with the sauce, which must not 
be made too hot, or it will curdle. The chicken, which 
has meanwhile been kept hot, is then served with this 
sauce poured over it, A slight flavouring of lemon- 
juice may be added if liked. 

Ducks, stewed as above along with peas, are a favou- 
rite dish. The peas should be put in, twenty minutes 
after the ducks. When peas are not id season, the 
gravy may be flavoured with sage and thyme finely 
shred. Ducks may be ragoued in a gravy drawn from 



76 DIRECTIONS rOR STEWING. 

the giblets. It should be highly seasoned and thickened 
with butter rolled in flour before serving. 

Giblets. The Giblets of any kind of fowl make an 
excellent stew or ragout. They should be highly sea- 
soned, and the gravy thickened as above. 

Gurry. Fowls, Rabbits, Veal, or any white meat, 
may be curried as follows : — The meat is cut up into 
rather small pieces, and then saut6ed in butter in the 
stewpan over a smart fire along with some sliced onions. 
When it is lightly browned, some broth is added, in which 
it must stew till about half done. The required quan- 
tity of curry powder, with a little flour, and a sufficiency 
of salt, is then mixed smooth with a little cold water 
in a basin, and added to the stew, which must now be 
simmered till the meat is tender. It is then dished, 
the sauce being poured over it, and served with boiled 
rice prepared as directed on p. 54, either in a separate 
dish, or surrounding the curry in the same dish. 

Salmon^ God, Iladdoch, or almost any kind of fish, 
may be curried by cutting them in slices, and again 
dividing these into smaller pieces about the size of a 
walnut, and then stewing them in a sauce made as fol- 
lows : — To some sliced onion saut^ed in about an ounce 
of butter till slightly yellow, add two table-spoonfuls 
of curry powder and a little flour, and then mix well 
with this about a pint of strong broth made hot. When 
the fish has stewed till cooked in this sauce, the super- 
fluous oil must be poured off, and the curry served with 
rice, as above directed ; a seasoning of lemon juice 
may, if liked, be added to the sauce immediately be- 
fore serving. Skate is the better of being plain boiled 
separately from the sauce, which, in this ease, may be 
flavoured with an apple sliced and boiled to a pulp in it. 
When the skate is thoroughly drained from its liquor, 
and dished, the sauce, after being strained, is poured 
over it. 

The best mode re-warming all kinds of stews is to 
heat them in an earthen jar, immersed in a pot of boil- 
ing water. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 77 

CHAPTER X. 

DBE8SING COOKED MEAT. 

In whatever way this ib done^ it must never be forgotten, 
as is too often the case, that the meat, being already 
cooked, requires merely to be warmed, and that if in 
doing this a heat sufficient to cook raw meat be applied 
to it, it will inevitably be spoiled by being overdone. 
The most usual method is that called Hashing, which 
if properly done will be found to produce a dish re- 
sembling a ragout, which is at once savoury, nutritious, 
and economical. 

Hashed Beef, Veal, or Mutton, These are prepared 
from cold roast beef, roast veal, and cold roast or boiled 
mutton ; if the meat is rather underdone, so much the 
better. Cut it from the bones in small thin slices, and 
trim away from tbem all the gristly and skinny parts. 
Break the bones, and gently simmer these and the 
trimmings along with some sliced onion in a little 
water, so as to exti*act as much of their gravy as pos- 
sible. Remove the bones and trimmings; strain the 
sauce, add any of the roast-meat gravy that may be left, 
season with pepper and salt, and thicken it with a small 
piece of butter rolled in dour. Then place the pieces 
of cold meat in it, and let the stewpan stand by the side 
of the fire till these are warmed through, when the hash 
is ready. The dish in which it is served may be lined 
with small strips of toasted bread. This plain hash may 
be more highly flavoured by the addition of sliced car- 
rot, which should be put in along with the bones to 
allow it time to cook, and a few sweet herbs; a little 
mushroom ketchup may also be added to the gravy 
before dishing. Hashed Veal may be flavoured with 
finely-minced lemon peel. The form of this hash may 
be varied by cutting the meat into very small dice. 
This mode is applicable to cold meat that has been so 
ill carved or so well used up that neat small slices can- 



78 DIRECTIONS FOR 

not be got from it. The mode of dressing it is precisely 
the same, only the meat will not take so long to warm 
through. When cold veal is dressed this way, some 
boiled ham or lean bacon cut small along with it makes 
a savoury addition. Cold roast lamb and venison may 
also be hashed as above, a little mutton broth being 
added to the sauce for the latter, which may also be 
flavoured with a little red currant jelly. 

Hashed Pork, The remains of roast pork, cut in 
small thin slices, dusted with flour, and seasoned with 
pepper and salt, may be heated in a sauce made as fol- 
lows: — Put into a stewpan two table -spoonfuls of 
chopped onion, a wine-glassful of vinegar, two cloves, a 
blade of mace, and a bay leaf. Simmer this till the 
vinegar is about half evaporated, then take out the 
seasonings, put in half a pint of hot broth or water, and 
add the pork. When this has simmered for about ten 
minutes it is ready for serving. A small quantity of 
mustard may be added to the sauce if desired. 

Hashed Hare, The cold roast hare is cut into pieces, 
the joints of the legs and shoulders being divided. A 
gravy is then prepared from the head, trimmings, &c., 
seasoned with pepper and salt, an onion, and a bouquet 
of sweet herbs, to which a little red currant jelly may be 
added. In this gravy the pieces of hare are warmed. 
The stuffing may be cut in slices and warmed in the 
gravy also, and when the hash is dished, these are placed 
as a garnishing round the edge. The sweet herbs 
should be removed from the sauce before dishing. 

Hashed Poullry, Game, or Rabbits, These, whether 
roast or boiled, are all treated in the same wav as hashed 
hare. If boiled, some of the liquor they were boiled in 
may be used to make the sauce, being enriched by the 
necks, heads, &c. being stewed in it. It may also be 
thickened with butter rolled in flour. 

Hashed Duck or Goose, These birds make excellent 
hashes. Being cut in pieces as usual, they are warmed 
in a gravy prepared as follows : — Cut an onion into 
small dice and brown it slightly in a little butter in the 



DRESSING COOKED MEAT. 79 

siewpan ; mix a table-spoonful of flour with it, and then 
add by degrees a gravy prepared by stewing the neck, 
head, and trimmings, in about a pint of water. The 
sauce should be highly seasoned with pepper, salt, and 
ketchup, to which a little finely-shred sage may be 
added, era little of the stuffing may be used to thicken 
the sauce. 

Curry powder may be used as an ingredient in any 
of the above hashes, in which case proportionally less 
pepper should be employed in the seasoning. Thus pre- 
pared, they may be served with rice like other curries. 

Cold Beef Olives may be made in the same way as 
directed on p. 73, with slices of very tender underdon9 
roast beef. They are very slightly stewed, so as not to 
oyercook them, in a gravy prepared as for a hash. 

Hashes, like stews, may be re-warmed in ah earthen- 
ware vessel placed in a saucepan of boiling water. 

English Stew is made with any kind of cold butcher 
meat, as follows : — Cut the meat as for hash, sprinkle 
it with pepper, salt, and flour, and lay it in a dish. 
8trew among the meat some pickled cabbage or onions, 
or any kind of pickles. Then make a sauce of half a 
tea-cupful of water, a little of the pickle vinegar, a 
small quantity of mushroom ketchup, and any of the 
gravy belonging to the meat which may be preserved. 
Stir these ingredients well together, and pour the sauce 
over the meat. The dish is then set before the fire in 
a dispatch, or in the oven, and when the meat is heated 
through it is ready. 

Bubble and Squeak is made of cold salt beef and 
boiled cabbage. Thinnish slices of the beef, well 
peppered, are slightly saut^ed in fresh butter. These 
are then kept warm before the fire, while the cabbage, 
which must be chopped small and seasoned with pepper 
and salt, is saut^ed in the butter which remains in the 
frying-pan after doing the beef. The cabbage is then 
spread in a hot dish, and the beef laid on the top of it, 
and served hot. In this dish veal is a very good sub- 
stitute for salt beef, A good sauce for this is made by 



80 DIRECTIONS FOR 

mixing some pickled cucumber and onion chopped 
small with melted butter, and slightly flavouring it 
with mustard. 

Cold Beef, or Mutton, Broiled. The inside of a roast 
sirloin of beef or of a leg of mutton, being the most 
tender and juicy part, is the best for this. The -more 
underdone it may be, the better. Cut the slices even 
and rather thick, and broil them quickly over or before 
(see p. 58) a strong clear fire, taking care that though 
slightly browned on the surface, they are merely warmed 
in the inside. They may be served in the same way 
as beef steaks, or with poached eggs laid upon them. 

Poultry and Game, The cold remains of any kind 
of roast or boiled poultry or game may be re-warmed 
by cutting them into neat small pieces, seasoning them 
well with pepper and salt, and sauteing them in oil or 
butter made rather hot. They may also be fried by dip- 
ping the pieces in a pancake batter, (see Chapter XII. 
Pancakes), and then immersing them separately in very 
hot dripping quite sufficient to cover them. When 
they are lightly browned, drain the fat from the pieces 
and dish them, piling them into a pyramid in the 
centre of the dish. A well-flavoured brown sauce may 
be poured over them. The pieces, before being dipped 
in the batter, may be seasoned by soaking them for 
half an hour in a mixture of two parts of vinegar, on© 
of oil, with some minced onion, and pepper and salt. 

Devils, These must be considered rather as provo- 
catives of appetite than as articles of food. They may 
be made of the remains of roast poultry or game, — 
legs, rumps, backs, gizzards, kc., very highly seasoned 
with spices, and broiled. Remainder bones of butcher- 
meat and venison, having of course a little meat upon 
them, kidneys, and sometimes even fish bones, are also 
used for the same purpose. The seasonings used con- 
sist of salt, pepper, cayenne, curry powder, mushroom 
powder, anchovy powder — in fact, anything which the 
ingenuity of the cook can devise to impart strong 
flavour and pungency. The proportions employed 



DRESSING COOKED MEAT. 81 

must be regulated by the taste of the eater, always re- 
membering that the true characteristic of a devil is 
extreme heat and pangencj, The meat is generally 
well scored and gashed, so aa to present a larger sur- 
face for the reception of the seasonings, which must 
be weir rubbed in. , Devils are served hot and drt/ as a 
relish with wine. When taken otherwise, grill sauce, 
anchovy sauce, or any piquante sauce, may be served 
with them. Dry toast and rusks are a usual accom- 
paniment. 

FrUadeUa, This is an economical mode of making 
a very palatable dish out of the cold remains of any 
kind of cooked meat, poultry, or fish. Soak in cold 
water a quantity of the crumb of bread, equal in weight 
to the meat. Minoe the meat along with a little fett. 
Pat the bread into a clean cloth and press it as dry as 
possible. Fry {sarUer) in butter a table-spoonful of 
chopped onion in a stewpan for about two minutes ; 
then add the bread, and stir it about with a wooden 
spoon. When becoming rather dry, put in the minced 
meat, with a seasoning of salt, pepper, nutmeg, and 
lemon peel, and keep stirring the whole till very hot. 
Then throw in, one at a time, two well beaten eggs ; 
incorporate them thoroughly with the mixture, and 
then pour it into a dish to cool. When cold, it is 
moulded into flattened balls about the size of small eggs ; 
these are then egged and bread-crumbed, and either 
sautded or fried, and served hot, with a napkin under 
them, or with a border of mashed potatoes. 

N. B, Even the remains of a dish of vegetables which 
has been used with the meat may be mixed with the 
above ; being chopped up where necessary, and intro- 
duced along with the bread crumb, proportionally less 
of which may in that case be employed. 



82 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 



CHAPTER XI. 

SOUPS AND SAUCES. 



GENSBAL DIREOTIONS. 

As most soups and manj sauces consist mainly of the 
juice of meat dissolved in water, attention must be 
paid in making them, to the proper method of extract- 
ing that juice. Of course, as has been shown in a pre- 
yious chapter, this method is essentially different from 
that practised in cooking meat which is intended to be 
eaten. In order completely to extract its juice, the 
meat must be cut into very small pieces, put into cold 
water, and gradually heated till boiling. Indeed the 
more slowly the heat is applied the better, because cold 
water is really a more perfect solvent of the Juice than 
hot water ; the heat being only necessary to cook the 
juice after it has been extracted, to coagulate the al- 
bumen, which is separated as scum, and to dissolve the 
gelatine. The juice may also be perfectly extracted by 
finely mincing the lean of raw meat, mixing it with 
cold water, and after allowing it to stand some time, 
straining it, and then subjecting the residuum of meat 
to strong pressure in a stout canvas bag, so as to squeeze 
out the last drop of moisture. The fluid thus obtained 
contains almost every particle of the savoury juice and 
soluble albumen of the meat, but it is deficient in the 
gelatine, which is necessary to give consistency to the 
soup. A very strong and stimulating beef-tea may how- 
ever be made by this latter method, — the liquor being 
of course seasoned with pepper and salt, boiled, and 
skimmed, and shred onion added if required. 

A broth prepared in the first of the above methods, 
so as to have a due proportion' of gelatine, forms the 
basis of most soups and sauces. For the former, 
especially for white soups, it is best made from veal. 



FOR SOUPS AND SAUCES. 83 

which furnishes a larger amount of gelatine than most 
other meats ; and to supply flavour^ in which the veal 
is rather deficient, - some lean ham or bacon is added, 
the proportions used being about six pounds of veal 
and half a pound of bacon to two gallons of water. For 
sauces, more particularly for brown sauces, beef is the 
best, as having a richer flavour. Meat of any sort (bones, 
trimmings, &c.) may however be used for either ; and 
the liquor in which any kind of meat, except pork, has 
been boiled, may be used instead of water, in which case 
less meat will be required. The scum should be re- 
moved as soon as it rises, and all fat ought also to be 
skimmed off. In from three to four hours the juice 
will be thoroughly extracted, after which it is worse 
than useless to continue the boiling, because if the fi- 
bres of the meat begin to separate, they will destroy 
the transparency of the soup. The liquor is then 
strained, and becomes what in the language of the kit- 
chen is called Stocky which by the addition of the proper 
seasonings, vegetables, and colouring and thickening 
substances, may be converted into almost any kind of 
soup. This stock, boiled down till reduced to a rather 
thick fluid of a yellowish brown colour, becomes what 
is called Qlaze, which forms a strong jelly when cold, 
and will keep good in that state for a considerable 
time. It is useful for making soups and sauces upon 
short notice, and also for various other purposes. In 
making this glaze^ a second stock, made by boiling the 
meat over again in a smaller quantity of water, after the 
first stock has been extracted, is sometimes used. This 
second stock will contain perhaps a larger proportion 
of gelatine than the first one ; but if that has been 
properly made, the second will be very poor, except 
perhaps in the loose meat fibre. Portable Soup consists 
simply of a very strong gelatinous glaze, dried in the 
form of tablets similar to common glue. 

SOUPS. — Before proceeding to give specific receipts 
for these, we desire to call attention to the following 



84 DIRECTIONS FOR SOUPS. 

general remarks : — let, All sonps made witH the flesh 
of full-grown animals, and not containing manj green 
yegetahles, are the better of being kept ^r a dkj after 
being made, as their ingredients thus blend better to- 
gether. They should be kept in earthen vessels, and 
not covered up till quite cold. 2d, Soups made with 
joung meat, and with a considerable proportion of green 
vegetables, bs^ best when fresh made, because when 
kept they have a tendency to ferment. When it be- 
comes necessary to keep such soups for a day or two, 
this tendency may be checked by boiling them up oc- 
casionally, and setting th^n aside in clean vessels. 3i/, 
Great care should be baken that soup is not smoked 
either during the making or in re-warming, but more 
particularly during the latter process, when it is pecu- 
larly liable to that mishap. For this purpose the fire 
should be clear, and the pot-lid close-fitting, ^th. 
The more volatile flavouring ingredients, such as ket- 
chup, aromatic spices, ^c, ought not to added until 
the soup is nearly ready, otherwise much laf their effect 
will be lost) and a lai^r quantity of them waU be re- 
quired. All the other ingredients should haye ample 
time to incorporate. 5th, When roots, such as carrot, 
turnip, &Q,, are intended to appear in slices in the soup, 
an hours boiling will be sufficient to cook them ; but 
when they are intended merely to flavour and thicken 
the soup, in which case they are the better of being 
grated, they should be added at a very early stage of 
the making. 6th, In making brown soups, the best 
plan to give colour is to fry (sauter) till well browned, 
a small portion of the meat used, along with some 
onions, before adding the water. This, though some- 
times apt to impair the transparency of clear soups, 
imparts the best flavour. Other methods of browning 
are also frequently employed — such as the addition of 
toasted bread, dark-coloured ketchup, and burnt meat 
or bones; but these last are decidedly bad, because 
they impart a bitter burnt flavour. A very good 
browning substance, if carefully made, consist of 



CLEAR SOUPS. 89 

sugar heated in a stewpan until blackened, but not 
burnt, and then melted in water. The sugar ought to 
have lost its sweetness, but if too much heated it will 
become bitter, which must be avoided. A few drops of 
this browning will suffice. Flour browned in the oven 
is a very good colouring substance for soups that re- 
quire to be thickened as well 7thy Should any clear 
soup tarn out not so transparent as desired, it may be 
clarified as follows :— 'Whisk the white of eggs with a 
little cold water in a basin, to which add gradually some 
of the boiling soup, still whisking the mixture. Pour 
this slowly into the pot of boiling soup, which must be 
n^idly stirred at the same time. Continue stirring 
the soup till it again nearly boils, when it may be re- 
moved from the fire, and allowed to stand till the white 
of egg separates. If the soup is now strained through 
a cieao cloth, it will be found perfectly clear. The 
number of eggs required is about one to each quart of 
soup. 

Clear Vegetable Soup. Peel some carrot and turnip 
and some small onions, cut the turnip and carrot into 
small dice of equal size, wash the whole in cold water, 
and drain them upon a sieve. When dry, place them 
in a saucepan with some butter and a tea-spoonful of 
powdered sugar over a quick fire. Let them fry (sau- 
ter) £6r about ten minutes, shaking them occasionally. 
When they become covered with a thin transparent 
glaae, neither milky-looking nor brown, pour over them 
two quarts of stock. When this begins to boil, set it 
by the side of the fire till the vegetables are quite ten- 
der, dumming off the butter as it rises to the surface. 
Season it according to taste, and serve it hot. 

A soup similar to the above may also be made with- 
out a previously prepared stock, by proceeding as direct- 
ed for making beef houilli (p. 39.) If prepared in this 
way, of course a larger pr(^rtion of beef, veal, or mut- 
ton, as the case may be, will be required for the soup, 
than is used for the same quantity of stock, because it 
is treated so as to retain enough of juice to make it 



S6 DIRECTIONS FOR 

eatable as boiled meat. For the ordinary requirements 
of a small hoosehold, this latter plan is periiaps the 
more economical, as the greater part of the meat em- 
ployed is fit for immediate use, and there results a 
smaller quantity of exhausted meat requiring some eco- 
nomical contriyance to use it up ; it is without doubt 
the least troublesome. If Veal be the meat employed 
in this way, shred parsley and a little rice may be added 
to the broth about half an hour before it is required ; 
and a piece of bacon boiled along with it not only im- 
proves the flavour of the soup, but makes a savoury ac- 
companiment to the veaL The bacon should be served 
separately in a dish along with some greens. In Mut- 
ton Brolk, some pearl barley is a very good addition to 
the other vegetables. This jnust be put in along with 
the meat. 

Vegetable soups may be almost infinitely varied, by 
employing more or less of each kind of vegetable, or 
omitting some or most of them altogether, so as to have 
the flavour of one kind predominant. In this way there 
is hardly an edible vegetable or herb which may not be 
introduced ; and even some which cannot be used in 
any other way, such as nettles, flowers of marigold, <&c. 
are frequently employed to impart their peculiar fla- 
vours and nutritious juices. As might be supposed, it 
would be utterly impos^ble to give names to each of 
these vanous compounds. Those in whicti any parU- 
culiar vegetable predominates, are of course called by 
the name of that vegetable ; — ^thua we have turnip soup, 
cabbage soup, dec. All other sorts have been very well 
classified by the French cooks under the designations 
of the seasons or months of the year during which their 
vegetable ingredients are in full perfection : — thus they 
have Prtntanihre Soup, Julienne Soup, viz. Spring Soup, 
July Soup, &c. 

Properly,, there are two distinct kinds of vegetable 
soups, — the clear soups, and the thick, or purSe soups; 
and a cook who knows the proprieties and elegancies of 
her art, will strictly preserve the distinction between 



OLBARSOUPS, 87 

the two. In the clear soups, as the name implies, the 
liquor should be as transparent as possible, and the 
▼egetables floating in it in small pieces as cut, distinct 
and undissolved. Thick sonps, on the contrary, which 
are most frequently made with one yegetable predo- 
minant, have the whole ingredients reduced to a 
homogeneous thin pulp. This condition is easily 
attained bj. thorough cooking, and bj rubbing the 
yegetables through a sieve or tanimj. The chief 
difficulty lies with the clear soups. To secure success 
in these, attention must be paid to the various lengths 
of time required to cook the different vegetables 
thoroughly without their becoming dissolved ; and as 
this not only depends upon their kind, but also varies 
with their age, they must be added to the soup at 
different stages of its preparation accordingly. Besides 
this, the small pieces into which the larger kinds re- 
quire to be cut must be all as nearly as possible of the 
same size, otherwise the smaller pieces, being sooner 
cooked, will become dissolved while the larger ones are 
yet -hard, and thus the transparency of the soup will 
foe destroyed. Thus it will be seen that the making 
of clear vegetable soup in perfection, requires an 
amount of knowledge and judgment which can only be 
acquired by experience. It must here be observed, 
however, that this nice distinction between clear and 
thick soups is entirely a matter of elegance and fashion, 
and consequently is not of so much importance in ordi- 
nary family cookery, as the wholesomeness and thorough 
cooking of the vegetable ingredients. 

Brown Soup is merely a good clear stock made from 
berfj and coloured to the required shade by one of the 
methods already described. It is seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and cayenne, and a little mushroom ketchup if 
desired. Toasted bread cut into small dice may be put 
into it before serving. 

Vermicelli, Italian Paste, Macaroni, Rice, Sagoy Se-' 
molina, and Tapioca Soups consist simply of well sea- 
soned clear stock with these substances boiled in it 



88 DIRECTIONS FOR 

without any vegetables. About two ounces of either 
of the first four is enough for a quart of stock ; rather 
less of the others will be sufficient, because they swell 
yery much. They should 'be boiled till tender, but no 
more, as their dissolying would thicken the soup. The 
Rice being first well washed and drained, is pat into 
cold stock, and this made to simmer ibout half an hour, 
or till the rice is sufficiently cooked : the others should 
all be put into the stock while boiling. Macaroni, which 
is the better of being preriously boiled for ten minutes 
in water and then drained, will be ready in about half 
an hour ; Semolina, Tapioca^ Sago, and Italian Paste, in 
twenty minutes; while Vermicelli will not require above 
ten minutes' boiling. Instead of stock, Broum Soup 
(see previous receipt) may be used for these sonps. 

THICK SO\]TS.—Purie of Vegetable Soup is made 
of the same materials as Clear Vegetable Soup (see p. 
85.) These being^ cut very small, are saut^ed as 
before, alon g with some lean ham or bacon. A spoon- 
ful of flour is then mixed with them, and the required 
quantity of stock poured over them, to which may be 
added a bunch of parsley and one or two potatoes 
When this boils it is seasoned to taste with salt and 
sugar, and then rubbed through a tammy ; the ham and 
parsley being removed. It now only requires to be made 
to boil, and when skimmed, it is ready. Serve hot, with 
fried or toasted bread in it. Some milk may be added, 
which should be put in boiling hot along with the stock 

Palestine Soup is a pur6e soup in which artichokes are 
the principal ingredient. It is prepared and served 
exactly as above, omitting the carrot and potatoes alto- 
gether, and also the larger part of the other vegetables, 
and substituting an equivalent quantity of Artichokes. 
Celery, or celery seed, may be employed to flavour it ; 
and as its colour ought to be pale, milk may be used in 
it, and some cream stirred in immediately before serving 
is considered an improvment. 
Purie of Caulifiou^er and Pur^e of Turnip Soups are 



\ 



THICK SOUPS. 89 

made preeiaelj m the last, substituting Cauliflower and 
Turnip for artichokes. A rery little more flour may be 
put into the latter. 

Crtcy Mid Oreey d la R&ine Soups are pur^ made 
with red Carrots and white Belgian Carrots respectively, 
instead of artichokes ; otherwise their ingredients are 
the same as those of Palestine Soup. For the former, 
the red part only of the carrots may be used, and this 
need not be saut^ed along with the other vegetables, 
but added afterwards, if it is desired to have it of a 
fine red colour. 

Onion Soup. A high flavoured Onion Soup may be 
made by saut^ing in butter till browned, a dozen or 
more largidb onions sliced, and then adding about two 
quarts of brown soup, in which the onions are to be 
simmered till reduced to a pulp, ^son rather highly 
with pepper, salt, and cayenne, — ginger may also be 
used, and curry powder is a very good spicing. The 
soup should be well skimmed, and may be thickened 
with a few split peas boiled till dissolved, or a piece of 
butter kneaded in flour. Onion Soup maigre is made 
by adding a little flour after the shred onions are 
saut^ed, and then using water instead of brown soup. 
In this case the onions may simmer till tender but not 
dissolved. Season with a little salt and sugar, and im- 
mediately before serving, stir in the yolks of four eggs 
miied with a little milk or cream. After this it must 
not boil, or the eggs will curdle. Pour it over stripe 
of the crust of a French roll placed in the tureen, and 
serve hot. Another maigre soup is made by using 
fewer onions, and putting to them, after they are sau- 
ted, a few handfuls of sorrel well washed and cut into 
stripe, along with some flour, and then adding a mix- 
ture of milk and water. It is flnished in th)e same 
manner as the other. 

Potato Soup is best made with a stock extracted 
from mutton or beef. A weak stock made with scraps 
or bon^s of meat will do very well. Ten or twelve good 
sound potatoes, after being cleaned, pared, or scraped. 



90 DIRECTIONS FOR 

and cleared of specks and eyes, are sliced ; and, along 
with three or four onions also sliced, are simmered in 
about a gallon of the stock till completelj dissolved. 
The soup is now seasoned with pepper and salt, a piece 
of butter added to it, and after simmering a few mi- 
nutes longer, it is ready for serving. This soup, if pro- 
perly made, should be rather thick, the dissolved pota- 
toes being completely diffused through the liquid. A 
little milk added to it improves its colour. It is very 
good made simply with water and a little dripping or 
butter, instead of stock. Sometimes potatoes have a 
rank flavour and smell, which may be removed by first 
slowly simmering them in water, and pouring off this 
water before they begin to dissolve. The soup is then 
made in the usual way. It may be passed through a 
sieve, but this will hardly be necessary if the potatoes 
are good, and the soup simmered long enough. 

€h*een Pease Soup. There are various modes of making 
this, one of which is as follows : — Put two quarts of 
shelled green pisas into a deep stewpan, along ,with a 
few sprigs of parsley, two onions sliced, four ounces of 
lean ham cut small, and four ounces of butter. Add 
some cold water, stir the whole well together, and after 
pouring off most of the water, set the s^tewpan, closely 
covered, over a sharp fire, until the peas are quite ten- 
der, — stirring them occasionally. When perfectly soft, 
mash them with a spoon against the side of the pan, 
adding a little flour while doing so. Then stir among 
them two quarts of stock, season with pepper, salt, and 
sugar, boil it for a few minutes, and rub it through a 
tammy or hair sieve. Return to the pan what passes 
through, boil it five minutes longer, and serve it hot 
with small dice of toasted bread in it. Another mode 
is to separate the young from the older peas while 
shelling them, and, reserving a pint of the young ones, 
to proceed as above with the rest, using instead of stock 
some water in which the younger pea-pods have been 
boiled. The reserved pint of young peas is added after 
the soup has been pa^ed through the sieve or tammy, 



THICK SOUPS. 91 

and then boiled in it till tender^ but not broken. A few 
leaves of mint may be added for those who like the fla- 
vour, and spinach is sometimes used to improve the 
colour. These should be boiled in it for a few minutes 
before rubbing it through the tammj. 

Winter Pease Soup, This is perhaps the cheapest of 
all soups, as it can be made very good without stock ; 
using instead, merely the liquor in which any kind of 
meat has been boiled, or even water with a little butter 
or dripping, and any odd scraps of cooked or uncooked 
meat, bones, <bc. boiled in it ; and even these latter may 
be dispensed with, and the soup still be excellent, though 
made simply with water, and butter or dripping. Wash 
two or three pounds of split peas, rejecting those which 
float, and put them into a saucepan with cold soft water 
(if the water is hard, a very small quantity of carbonate 
of soda will soften it), along with the meat, scraps, and 
bones well broken, and some turnip, carrot, and onion 
sliced, a bunch of thyme, and two or three heads of 
celery, or what does as well, a little celery seed. Let 
these boil slowly till the peas dissolve, stirring them 
frequently to prevent them from burning on the bottom 
of the saucepan, which they are very apt to do. The 
soup is then rubbed through a sieve and returned to 
the saucepan, seasoned with pepper and salt, boiled 
again for a few minutes, and then poured into the 
tureen, into which some toasted bread cut into dice 
has been thrown, and served hot. When pease soup is 
made with stock, or with boiled meat liquor, the peas 
i^ould be first boiled till dissolved as above in soft water 
and these added afterwards. If some beef, or veal and 
bacon, be boiled in it to be eaten, no stock or meat 
liquor will be required. In whatever way made, it is 
always improved by a day's keeping, the vegetables not 
being in that case added to it tiU it is re-warmed on 
the day on which it is to be used. The longer the 
peas are boiled, the smoother and mellower the soup. 

Lentil Soup, Place in a stewpan three onions, a 
turnip and a small carrot cut into thin slices, a few 



92 DIRECTIONS FOR 

sprigs of parsley and thyme, and a bay leaf, along 
with any scraps of meat (beef is the best for the pur- 
pose) cut in small pieces^ and some butter. Fry {sauter) 
these till quite brown, stirring them conthraally. Then 
add a quart of lentib and three quarts of water, and 
let them simmer till the lentils are tender. When they 
are quite soft, poor off the broUi, add some flour to 
the lentils, and mash them in the stewpan.; then return 
the broth, boil it up, and continue stirring it while 
boiling. Lastly, rub the soup through a sieye, rewarm, 
and season it with pepper, salt, and sugar ; then skim 
it, and serve it hot, with toast cut as for pease soup. 
The lentils may be kept whole if desired, in which case 
the meat may be omitted, and boiled meat liquor, stock 
or brown soup, used instead of water, or a piece of 
meat may be boiled in it, to be eaten the same day. 
A very good Lentil Soup maigre may be made without 
meat, or even without lentils, using merely the water 
in which a dish of kntik has been boiled (see p» 55% 
by saut^ing sliced onions in a stewpan, mixing scmie 
flour with them, and then adding the lentils and water, 
—or witlioQt lentilsy pouring oyer them the lentil 
liquor ; — season to taste as above. 

STEW SOUPS, or Soups d la Faurdkette.-^TheM 
are a class of soups in which the meat with wluch they 
are made is served in them in th£ form of small pieces 
or monthfttls, not requiring the use of a knife and fork. 
In their ingredients and mode of prepavation, most of 
them resemble ragouts^ The best portions of the meat 
being intended to be eaten, are treated aecordingLy ; 
while the inferior parts and the bones are, where stock 
is not used, made to yield their juices, to enridi the soup. 
The chief difference between these soups and ragoots 
is, that in the soups there is a larger quantity of ^qvid, 
a greater proportion of vegetables, and generally*, though 
not in every case, less spice ; ike meat also in served 
in smaller pieces, as it is to be eaten with a spoon^ 

Ox-tail Soup. This may be made of two or three 



STEW SOUPS. 93 

ox-tailS| diyided into joints, slightly 8aut6ed in butter, 
and then stewed in about three quarts of good beef 
stock,, or brown soup, till the meat becomes quite ten- 
der, and is beginning to leave the bones. If no stock is 
used, but simplj water, another tail may be taken, and 
part of the smaller pieces left unsaut6ed to yield their 
juice. It should be seasoned with whole black pepper 
and salt, which must be put in at the beginning of the 
preparation. Vegetables — as carrot, turnips, onions 
or leeks, and celeiy — sliced, and parsley and thyme, 
may be boiled in it, especially if it is made without 
stock ; the onions being sauted along with the meat ; 
* and it may be thickened with browned flour if desired. 

Kidney Sowp is made with kidneys cut into slices, 
and cooked precisely as above. 

Ox-^heek Soup may be made similarly to the pre- 
eeding; two ox-cheeks being sufficient to make four 
quarts of soup. These should be well washed, blanched 
in boiling water, the meat cut from the bones, and di- 
yided into smallish pieces. The best, or cheek parts, 
toe ihaa slightly saut^ed as above, along with some 
onion ; and a properly seasoned stock drawn from the 
bones (which should be broken for the purpose) and in- 
ferior pieces, is strained and poured over them ; vege- 
tables being added if desired. Another way is to keep 
the cheek pieces whole, omit the saut^ing, and cook 
ihem in the stock, as boiled meat (see pp. 37 and 38.) 
When cooked, they are cut into pieces of the requisite 
siae, and served in the soup as usuaL If this latter 
mode is adopted, the soup may be coloured with brown- 
ing (see pp. 84-85). Calf^s Head Soup may be made 
in the same way. Being a white soup, the seasoning 
should be white pepper, — and rice may be added. 
Sheeps* and Lambs' heads also, treated as above, will 
produce a very good soup, with the addition of any 
kind of stock. 

Beal Scotch Sheep's-Head Broth is very different. It 
is not a stew-soup. The head and " trotters," which 
ought always to accompany it, not beiog skinned, have 



94 OIRB0TION8 FOR 

the hair singed off with a red-hot iron by a blacksmith, 
an operation which not only gives the sonp its peculiar 
flaTOur, bat constitutes the first step of the cooking, 
being equivalent to the preliminary saut6ing of stewed 
meat, or the first plunging into boiling water of boiled 
meat. After this they have to be thoroughly cleaned, 
by soaking in water, scraping, and scrubbing ; which 
operation is greatly facilitated by smearing them, before 
soaking, with the slimy inside of the eyes. The head 
is then split down the middle, the brains removed, and 
the nose and root of the tongue cleaned out. It is 
again well washed, and is then ready for the pot. The 
broth is then made with the head and trotters, and 
two or three pounds of the neck, in the way described 
for bouUli (p. 39.) Barley is always an ingredient in 
this broth, and old green or white peas are genendly 
added ; young green peas, when in season, being of 
course preferable. The barley and old peas are put in 
along with the meat, as they require longer boiling 
than the other vegetables. When the head is tender, 
it is served separately from the broth, with the trotters, 
round it, and garnished with some of the carrot and 
turnip, which should be kept in large slices for that 
purpose. 

Irish Soup is made with the scrag end of a neck of' 
mutton, and potatoes. The meat is treated as directed 
on p. 39, and the potatoes and some onion, but no other 
vegetables, are sliced thin and boiled in the broth till 
reduced to a pur^e. Season with pepper and salt; and 
before serving, cut the meat which is to be eaten, into 
pieces of a convenient size, and return it to the soup, 
which should not be quite so thick as potato soup. 

Mulligatawny Soup, Cut the meat of three poutids 
of a breast of veal into small pieces, and simmer the 
trimmings, gristles, and bones, along with a knuckle of 
veal broken in pieces, in about three quarts of water, 
until these are converted into a strong gelatinous stock. 
Fry {8av;ter) the pieces of meat in butter, in a deep 
stewpan, along with some sliced onion, and a slice of 



STEW B0UP8. 95 

lean ham. When slightly browned, add two table- 
8t>oonfuls of flour, mix well, and pour over them the 
stock previously strained. Allow this to simmer gentlj 
for nearly an hour, skimming off the fat as it rises. 
Then add two or three dessertHspoonfuls of curry pow- 
der, season with salt and cayenne to taste, and continue 
the simmering till the veal is thoroughly cooked. Be- 
fore serving, remove the ham. Carrot and turnip may 
be used in this soup if desired, being sliced and saut^ed 
along with the meat and onion ; apples also are some- 
times employed in the same way. The remains of 
cooked fowls or rabbits, cut into pieces of the proper 
size, msly be warmed up in this soup and served along 
with, or instead of, the veal. 

Mock Turtle Soup is also made with veal. Procure 
the half of a calf's head, not skinned, but well scalded 
and cleaned. Gut the meat from the bone, and then 
divide it into neat small peices. Make a strong gela- 
tinous stock from the bone and a knuckle of veal, both 
well broken, along with a quarter of a pound of lean ham, 
some carrot, turnip, and onion sliced, a little parsley, 
and a bay leaf. Fry (sauter) the meat of the head in 
butter in a deep stewpan, along with some sliced onion 
and some lemon thyme, and marjoram, tied together. 
When the meat is slightly browned, remove the herbs 
and add some flour, stirring it well with the butter ; 
then pour over it the stock, previously strained. Throw 
in the softer gristles and glutinous tendons of the 
knuckle cut in small pieces, and then stir the whole 
over the fire till it simmers. Skim off all the fat, sea- 
son the soup with salt, pepper, and cayenne to taste, 
and when the pieces of meat are quite tender, it is 
ready to serve. Some cream may be stirred into it if 
liked, immediately before pouring it into the tureen. 

Hotch Patch is made with mutton, or ribs of lamb 
and a stock of mutton. Proceed as directed for Beef 
Bouilli (p. 39.) If Lamb is used, treat it so that it 
may be eaten ; that is to say, keep it whole and cook it 
so as to preserve its juices, in a stock made from mut- 



96 OIJtBOTIONS FOR 

ton. The vegetables used are young turnips, onions, 
lettuce, carrots, parsley and green peas. As the flavour 
of the soup ought to be sweetisdi, the carrots and peas 
should predominate over ihe rest, and the turnips are 
best of the sweet white kind. Half of the carrots used 
should be grated, and the rest, abng with the other 
vegetables requiring it, cut in small pieces. Half of 
the peas should be put into the soup earlj, in order to 
be dissolved in it, and the other half reserved till near 
the end of the process that thej maj be kept whole. 
The older peas are the best for the former purpose, and 
the younger ones for the latter ; the two being se- 
parated in the process of shelling. When the lamb or 
mutton that is to be eaten is cooked, the meat must be 
taken out of the pot, the exhausted portion set aside 
for other purposes, and that which is eatable cut into 
pieces of the proper size and returned to the soup, 
which is then seasoned with white pepper and salt, re- 
warmed, and served. 

Hare Soup, Having well cleaned and cut up the 
hare into neat small pieces, select the best and most 
fleshy of these to be served in the soup ; and with the 
rest, including the blood of the hare,, which should be 
preserved for this purpose in cleaning it, make about 
five quarts of stock, which may be farther enriched jif 
desired by the addition of a piece of beef, and another 
of lean bacon. Then melt half a pound of butter in a 
large stewpan over a brisk fire, and stir into it three 
quarters of a pound of flour. When tlus has become 
slightly browned, throw in the reserved pieces of the 
hare, and continue stirring until these are firmed on the 
surface. Then pour the stock over them, add two 
onions, some parsley and thyme, a bay lea^ and a little 
celery seed ; and simmer it till the pieces of hare are 
thoroughly cooked, — skimming ofi* the butter which 
rises to the sur&ce. When done, remove the bones, 
rub the soup through a fine sieve, season it with pepper 
and salt, re warm, and serve it hot. It may be thickened 
by the addition of some of the pieces of hare which 



STBW SOUPS, 97 

hare been used in making the stock, pounded to a paste 
in a mortar. Babbits, pheasants, partridges, or other 
game, maj be made into soup in the same way. 

Chck-a'Leekie, This is made, as its name implies, 
with a fowl and leeks, and some clear stock. Although 
a stock made from the shin of beef is generally recom- 
mended, yet any kind of 'Stock, or even the liquor in 
wMeh meat has been boiled, will make excellent soup, 
if the fowl be a good-sized one. If a large old fowl be 
used, as is frequently the case, it is the better of being 
stewed for a short time before making the soup. Two 
or three dozen of fine winter leeks are about the quan- 
tity employed ; but this of course must depend on the 
sise of the leeks and the taste of those who are to par- 
take of the soup. Being well washed, and trimmed of 
their roots and the coarser part of the green leaves, they 
are cut into pieces an inch long, and half of these added 
to the boiling stock along with the fowl, which is trussed 
and treated as if for boiling. When the fowl is cooked, 
it is lifted out, and the rest of the leeks put in. The 
fowl is then cut into pieces of the required size, the 
bones removed if thought necessary, and when the 
second half of the leeks is tender, the pieces of fowl are 
returned to the soup, which is then seasoned with pep- 
per and salt, re-warmed, and served ; — the first half of 
the leeks being now of course reduced to a pulp, the 
soup does not require any other thickening. If the 
flavour of the leeks is thought too strong, the half of 
the above quantity may be omitted, and an equal pro- 
portion of shred greens substituted in their stead. 

OibUt Soup, Two sets of goose giblets, well cleaned, 
cut in small pieces, and slightly saut^ed in butter, are 
simmered till tender in some good beef stock, or brown 
soupy along with some carrot, turnip, onions, parsley, 
thyme, and bay leaves. The soup is seasoned rather 
highly with mushroom ketchup, salt, and cayenne, and 
thickened with butter kneaded in fiour. When the 
giblets are quite tender, but not over-cooked, the soup 
may be strained; and when re-warmed, it is served with 

H 



98 DIRECTIONS FOB 

the giblets, and, if desired, some of the vegetables in 
small pieces in the tureen along with it. 

Pigeon Soup. The livers and gizzards of the pigeons 
are first boiled for half an hour in some good stock of 
any kind. The pigeons are then trussed, seasoned, 
saut^ed, and cooked in this stock precisely as directed 
for stewed pigeons on page 75. The soup may be 
thickened with butter rolled in flour, and seasoned with 
white pepper and salt. When thoroughly tender, the 
pigeons should be cut up, the bones removed, the meat 
divided into small pieces and returned to the soup, 
which after being re-warmed, is then served. 

FISH SOUPS.— Wh^re a stock is required for these, 
it may be made either from meat or fish. The latter 
is to be preferred as being more in accordance with the 
nature of the soup. It may be made from any kind of 
white fish, or more economically by boiling down aome 
of the liquor of boiled fish until considerably reduced 
in quantity, enriching it at the same time by the ad- 
dition of the trimmings, — heads, fins, &c, of the fish 
which are to be served in it. This must be strained 
before using ; and as fish stock soon becomes sour when 
kept, it ought not to be made until required. An ex- 
cellent fish soup may be made by flavouring some stock 
made as above, with onions, grated lemon-peel, thyme, 
and parsley, seasoning it with pepper, salt, and ketr 
chup, thickening it with butter kneaded in fiotq^ or 
oatmeal, and finally straining it. If desired, ^uHl. 
square pieces of any kind of fish, fried, may be served in 
it. It then goes by the name of the fish used ; — Had- 
dock Soup, Skate Soup, &c, 

Crappit Beads, This excellent Scotch dish is made 
as follows : — Having well cleaned and prepared as fc:* 
boiling three or four middling-sized haddocks or whi- 
tings, cut off the heads and divide the bodies into three 
parts of equal length. Then stuff the heads and the 
shoulder-pieces with a forcemeat made thus : — Mince 
finely a few small onions, and mix these with the melts 



FISH 30UP8. 99 

of the fish and as much well-dried oatmeal as will make 
the whole into a stiff paste ; season this with pepper 
and salt, and, when stuffed into the heads <bc., secure it 
by tying a piece of coarse thread round them. Put the 
stuffed pieces into boiling water, a little more than will 
just cover them, and after about ten minutes boiling, 
add the tail pieces. When these are sufficiently cooked, 
take out the fish, and after removing the threads from 
the stuffed pieces, place it in a tureen ; then season the 
liquor with pepper, salt, and ketchup, and if not sufii- 
ciently thickened with the stuffmg it may have dis- 
solved, put a piece of butter kneaded in flour into it, 
and when this is thoroughly mixed, re-warm the soup, 
pour it over the pieces in the tureen, and serve it. 

Ed Soup, For this, the eels being well cleaned, 
must be cut in pieces, but need not be skinned. They 
are first saut^ed in butter till slightly coloured, along 
with some sliced onion. Boiling water is poured over 
them in the proportion of about a quart to every pound 
of eels, and when this boils it must be carefully skim- 
med. Parsley and thyme are next added, after which 
it must simmer under a close cover for about two hours; 
when it may be strained, seasoned with black pepper 
and salt, thickened with a mixture of butter and flour, 
re-warmed, and served. Small pieces of any kind of 
white fish or eels, saut^ed, may be served in it. 

Lobster Soup, Boil two good hen lobsters, and when 
cold, split the tails and crack the large claws, and re- 
moving the meat, cut it into pieces to be served in the 
soup. Pick the meat from the chines, bruise the re- 
maining husks and the small claws, and simmer them 
for twenty minutes in about two quarts of veal or cow- 
heel stock, which having by that time extracted their 
flavour, may then be strained. To thicken it, pound 
in a mortar the meat picked from the chines, the spawn, 
the soft part of the bodies, and part of the coral, along 
with a little butter and flour, and when these are 
thoroughly incorporated and reduced to a pulp, add 
the stock to it giudually. When well mixed, pass the 



100 DIRECTIONS FOR FISH SOUPS. 

Boup through a sieve^ season it with pepper, cayenne, 
and salt if necessary, and re-warm it. Then put the 
pieces of meat from the tails and large claws, and the 
remainder of the coral cut into similar pieces, into the 
soup tureen, pour the soup over them, and serve it im- 
mediately. In order to secure the fine red tint which 
lobster soup ought to have, and which is produced by 
the spawn, it is as well to remove this from the lobsters 
before boiling them, and use it raw in thickening the 
soup, because when much cooked, it b very apt to 
have its colour impaired. 

Sometimes forcemeat balls are served in this soup. 
These are composed of part of the corals and of the meat 
from the chines, pounded along with the yolks of two 
eggs, a little flour, and a seasoning of grated lemon- 
peel, nutmeg, mace, and cayenne, to which an anchovy 
may be added. This forcemeat, made into little balls, 
may be slightly fried before putting it into the soup. 
Onions also may be added, but these should be boiled 
in the stock along with the chine, husks, <fec., so that 
they may be thoroughly cooked. 

Oyster Soup, Put half a hundred oysters along with 
their liquor into a stewpan, and heat them gently until 
beginning to simmer, taking care not 'to over-heat or 
boU them, which would make them tough. Then drain 
them upon a sieve, catching the liquor in a basin be^ 
neath. Take off the beards, return these to the liquor, 
and put the oysters into the soup tureen, as they will 
require no more cooking. Melt in a stewpan a quarter 
of a pound of butter, and mix with it about six ounces 
of flour. Stir this over the fire for a few minutes (but 
do not let it become browned), and then allow it to cooL 
Add to this the liquor and beards of the oysters, two 
quarts of good veal stock, and one of milk. Stir the 
whole over the fire till it boils ; season it with pepper, 
cayenne, and salt, to which may be added a little essence 
of anchovies ; after it has boiled for about ten minutes^ 
skim it, add a gill of good cream, strain it through a 
hair sieve into the tureen containing the oysters, and

serre it hot. Similar soups may be made of mussels, 
cockles, and other shell-fish ; but it must be borne in 
mind that in this as in all other modes of cooking them, 
these fish will most certainly become tough and indi- 
gestible by being boiled. They should merely be made 
hoi 

8AnCE8. — ^These are liquid preparations used to 
giye relish to dishes. They are of various kinds. Some 
are sweet, others are salt, and a few are a mixture of 
sweet and acid. Of the salt kind, many are strong fla- 
Toured, and of a dark colour, being composed chiefly of 
concentrated meat-gravy, or the juice of the more pun- 
gent vegetables and herbs, such as onions ; while there 
are others which are more bland, and whose purpose is 
merely to impart a cream-like richness to the viands 
they accompany. The sweet-and-acid kind are used 
rather sparingly when applied to meat, for their object 
is merely to modify slightly the natural flavour ; pro- 
duoiiig an effect similar to the haut gout which results 
from long keeping. They are mostly used with game. 
Sweet sauces are employed principally with sweet 
puddings. 

The composition and proper application of sauces is 
a branch of cookery to which, stimulated no doubt by 
the demands made upon them by the jaded epicurism 
of those for whom they cater, professional cooks, am- 
bitious of artistic fame, most assiduously apply them- 
selves. To invent a sauce, and thereby perpetuate their 
name, is the great object of their aspiration. The re- 
sult has been, as before observed, that while remarkable 
piogresshas been made in the art of merely pleasing the 
palate, that of producing wholesome food has been com- 
paratively neglected. Now although these objects are by 
no means incompatible, yet as this work professes to be 
devoted more particularly to the latter, its receipts for 
sauces will not be found very numerous. It will how- 
ever contain directions for making those which are in 
most general use, including all that are specially re- 
ferred to in the previous chapters. 



102 DIRECTIONS FOR SAUCES. 

Melted Butter. Put into a small saucepan two ounces 
of soft fresh butter, and a large table-spoonful of flour. 
Mix these well together while cold, with a wooden 
spoon, and then add about half a pint of cold water, 
nearly a tea-spoonful of salt, and a little pepper. Set 
this over the fire, and stir it continually till nearly boil- 
ing, when it is ready for use. The ingredients ought 
to be perfectly blended, and in this the chief difficulty 
occurs in the case of the butter, which, from bad quality 
or other causes, will frequently float as oil on the sur- 
face. This imperfection may be partially remedied by 
adding a very little cold water, and then pouring the 
sauce quickly backwards and forwards from the sauce- 
pan into the basin. Prepared as above, melted butter is 
the basis of a large number of sauces, the distinctive 
flavouring or other ingredients being added as required. 
Thus a little ketchup and vinegar will convert it into 
a very good plain fish sauce. It must be observed that 
where the additions are fluid, the melted butter ought 
to be made rather thick by using less water; and the 
reverse, where the addition, as in egg sauce, tends of 
itself to thicken the sauce. Acids when mixed with 
melted butter are apt to make it "oil;" to prevent this 
they must be well stirred in. When it is desired that 
the colour of the sauce should be v6ry delicate, milk 
may be used instead of water in preparing the melted 
butter. The following sauces are all made with melted 
butter. 

Onion Sauce. Peel the onions, boil them till soft, 
then mince them very fine, and stir them into hot melted 
butter. This sauce may be used to '* smother" rabbits 
instead of that described on page 46. The sauce recom- 
mended for roast mutton will be found on page 105. 

Parsley Sauce, Boil till tender a bunch of well- 
washed and picked parsley ; then removing the larger 
stalks, mince the leaves &iely, and stir them into 
melted butter made hot. 

Fennel Sauce consists of melted butter with some 
chopped fennel mixed with it. 



DIRB0TI0N8 FOR 8AU0BS. 103 

Cc/per Sauce is made by mixing with melted butter 
some capers, together with a little of their pickle-vine- 
gar. If half the quantity used be minced, the flavour 
will be better developed. Lemon-juice maj be added 
to this if a stronger acid is liked. 

Oherkin Sauce consists of melted butter with a few 
pickled Gherkins minced and stirred into it. Pickled 
Nasturtiums may also be used in the same way. This 
is sometimes called Mock Gaper Sauce. 

Lemon Sauce. Pare a lemon, removing as much ot 
the white part of the rind as possible ; cut it quickly 
into thick slices with a sharp knife, divide these into 
Mnall dice, and stir them into melted butter. 

N, £. — For cutting and mincing lemon or pickles, 
a nlver knife is the best, as the acid does not corrode 
it. 

FISH SAJJGES.— Lobster Sauce. Pound into a 
smooth paste in a mortar, the spawn and coral of a 
boiled lobster, along with a piece of fresh butter. Rub 
this through a sieve, and mix it smoothly with melted 
batter ; add some of the meat from the tail cut into 
■mall dice, and then stir the sauce over the fire till 
quite hot, but not boiling. This sauce may be seasoned 
with cayenne and ketchup, pickle-vinegar, &c. These 
however may be added at table by those who like them. 

Shrimp Sauce, Procure some boiled shrimps, remove 
the heads and shells, and boil these for twenty minutes 
in water sufficient for the sauce. Strain this, and with 
it make some melted butter (p. 102), to which add the 
bodies of the shrimps. Season with a little cayenne and 
salt if required, and then rewarm it as in the last. 

Oyster Sauce, Heat the oysters in their liquor till 
just beginning to simmer ; then drain them, take oiF 
the beards and return these to the liquor. With this 
make some melted butter (see page 102), adding a little 
mUk if desired ; season it with pepper, salt, and a very 
little cayenne, and strain it. To this add the oysters, 
and then re-warm it. — Mussel sauce is made in the 
same way. 



104 OIRBOTIONS FOR 8AU0BS. 

Egg Sauce. Cut the whites and jolks of a couple of 
hard-boiled eggs into small dice separately, and add 
first the whites, and then the jolks, to some thinnish 
melted butter (p. 102), placed over the fire, allowing 
the whites to become heated before putting in the yolks, 
else these latter will be too much cUssdlved. 

Anchovy Sauce. After removing the bones, pound 
the anchovies with a little butter into a smooth paste, 
and stir this into some thin melted butter (p. 102). 
This sauce may be highly seasoned with hot spices and 
condiments, such as cayenne, mustard, horse-radish, 
kc] and lemon-juice or pickle-vinegar may also be in- 
troduced. It may likewise be made by flavouring melted 
butter with essence of anchovies. 

Besides the fish sauces above described, an economi- 
cal cook may contrive others equally good for ordinary 
family use from the trimmings of the fish she is dressing. 
Thus, when frying or sautling fish, she may boil the 
heads, fins, bones, and livers, and so produce a well fla- 
voured liquor, which when strained, thickened with 
butter kneaded in fipur, and properly seasoned with 
ketchup and curry powder or other spices, constitutes 
an excellent plain fish sauce. It may be farther en- 
riched with some of the liver chopped, and the roe 
pounded, and stirred into it while being made hot pre- 
vious to serving. 

White Satice is made of clear stock prepared from 
veal or fowls. This is boiled with lemon-peel, onion, 
pepper, nutmeg, salt, parsley, thyme, and a little lean 
bacon ; and when properly seasoned, it is strained, and 
thickened with butter kneaded in flour. A little lemon- 
juice may be stirred into it just before serving. 

Beef Gravy, Cut a pound or a pound and a half of 
lean beef into thin sHces, and hack or score these to 
facilitate the escape of the juice. Butter the bottom 
of a stewpan, in which place the meat along with some 
sliced onion and a small piece of bacon. Brown these 
gently over the fire, shaking the pan occasionally to 



DIRSOTIONS FOR 8AU0BS. 105 

preteiit the meat from sticking to the bottom. Then 
cover the pan closely, and keep it hot by the side of the 
fire for about half an hoar ; after which put in about a 
pint of hot water, and some whole pepper, and make 
this simmer slowly for a couple of hours longer. The 
gravy thus made, when seasoned to taste with salt, 
and strained, is ready for use. If prepared for brown 
sauce, beef grayy may be more highly fiayoured by 
means of sliced carrot, celery, and a bay leaf saut^ed 
along with the beef, and a little mushroom ketchup 
added when nearly finished. 

Brown Sauce may be made of beef gravy prepared 
as above, and thickened with butter and fiour. This 
thickening may be applied in various ways. The sim- 
plest is merely to knead the butter and flour together 
into a paste, and mix it with the boiling gravy. In 
laige establishments where sauces are constantly being 
made which require this thickening, large quantities 
of the mixture are made at once, by melting the butter 
and stirring in the fiour over a brisk fire till it forms a 
paste of a deep yellow colour. Thus prepared, it is 
called, in the language of the French kitchen, Eottse, 
and may be kept good for a considerable time in 
covered earthen jars. The gravy for brown sauce may 
be made more gelatinous, and consequently of a richer 
consistency, though less highly fiavoured, by substituting 
some veal for part of the beef used in preparing it. 

Brown Onion Sauce, Peel and slice some large 
Spanish onions ; and along with a little butter, salt, and 
flour, put them into a closely-covered stewpan over a 
slow fire to stew and become browned, shaking the pan 
occasionally to turn them about and prevent their burn- 
ing. In about an hour and a half, add a little water 
or stock, season with pepper and cayenne, and stew 
them a little longer. The onions yield a rich gravy ; 
and when reduced to a pulp, the whole may be passed 
through a sieve, re-warmed, and served. The addition 
of some French mustard to this, converts it into Sauce 
Bobert ; English mustard gives a different flavour. 



106 , DIRECTIONS FOR SAU0E8. 

Brown MiLshroom Sauce. Slice a few well-cleaned 
small mushrooms, and place them along with a little 
butter, salt, pepper, and lemon-juice, in a stevrpan oyer 
a slow fire. When thej have saut^ed for a few 
minutes, add some beef gravy, and boil this till the 
mushrooms are tender, when the sauce is finished. A 
little mushroom ketchup may be added. For white 
meats, a White Mushroom Sauce may be made in the 
same way, using only the white parts of the mushrooms, 
and substituting a white stock and a little milk for the 
beef gravy; — of course ketchup, because of its dark 
colour, should not be introduced into this. 

Gucumher Sauce, Pare and slice the cucumbers, and 
remove the seeds. Stew them till reduced to a pulp 
in a little good stock, seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
cayenne. Thicken the sauce with a paste of bntter and 
flour, pass it through a fine sieve, and re-warm it. 

Celery Sauce, Wash well, and cut into slices about 
two inches long, a fresh young head of celery, and boil 
it till tender in weak broth or water. Season this with 
white pepper, nutmeg, and salt, and thicken it with a 
mixture of butter and fiour. Another simple celery 
sauce consists of melted butter made with a decoction 
of celery seed, and seasoned as above. 

Bread Sauce. Soak grated bread-crumbs in some 
white stock, and then simmer them along with a sliced 
onion, some white peppercorns, cloves, and a little salt. 
When the sauce is sufficiently seasoned, remove the 
onion and spices, and serve it hot. 

Grill Sauce. Make rather thick with a paste of 
butter and fiour, some good beef gravy, and season it 
highly with lemon-juice, ketchup, a little cayenne, and 
a tea-spoonful each of made mustard, essence of ancho- 
vies, minced onion, and grated lemon peeL This is 
appropriate to devilled fowl, &c., and may be used with 
fish by those who require a stimulating sauce. 

Horse-radish Sauce. Mix finely scraped or grated 
horse-radish with vinegar, and add a little salt. Some 
cream may be introduced if desired, and mustard is 



DIRBOTIONS FOR 8AU0BS. 107 

fiomeiimes added ; but if the horse-radish is good, the 
sauce will be pungent enough without this last addition. 

Apple Sauce, Pare, core, and slice four or five 
juicj baking apples, and cook them till tender, along 
with a piece lemon-peel, in an earthen jar placed in 
a pot of boiling water. The pot should be closely 
coyered, and care must be taken that none of the water 
enters the jar containing the apples. When the apples 
are sufficiently softened, remove the lemon-peel, and 
beat them to a pulp along with a little butter, at the 
same time sweetening them to taste with sugar. 

Green Oooaeberry Satice is made in the same manner 
as the above, with small green gooseberries, their tops 
and stalks being of course clipped off. A little ground 
ginger and vinegar may be added. 

Mint Sauce consists of fresh young leaves of mint 
finely minced and mixed with vinegar and sugar* 

CurranUjelly for Venison &c., may be served either 
melted or not in a small sweatmeat glass. 

Sharp Sauce for Venison is made by dissolving loaf 
sugar ioi white vinegar. This is also a very good sauce 
for coldsalt beef; and when made very sweet, with ground 
cinnamon added, it is a delicious sauce for pancaJies. 

Custard Sauce for Sweet Puddings and Fruit Pies or 
Tarts.-T-Heat in a very clean saucepan, till just about 
to boil, a pint of new milk. Beat together in a basin 
the yolk of two eggs, a little cream, and some pounded 
loaf sugar. Pour over this the hot milk, and imme- 
diately return the whole to the saucepan, and continue 
pouring it from the saucepan into the basin and back 
again until thoroughly mixed. Lastly, return it to the 
saucepan, set it over the fire, and stir it continually till 
nearly boiling. Serve it cold in a glass dish or jug, 
irith nutmeg grated over the top. 

Caudle Sauce for Plum Pudding, <kc. — With some 
thick melted butter made with very little salt, mix a 
glass of sherry wine, half a glass of brandy or rum, 
some loaf sugar, part of which has been rubbed upon 



108 GENERAL DIRECTIONS 

lemon-peel till saturttied with its juice, and a little 
ground cinnamon. Make the sauce hot, and serve it 
with some ground cinnamon sprinkled on the top. 



CHAPTER XII. 

FUDDINQS, PASTBT» &c. 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR PUDDINGS. 

There are two kinds of Puddings — ^viz. Boiled Puddings 
and Baked Puddings. The former are boiled in a cloth, 
or in an ornamental mould, from which thej are turned 
out upon the dish in which thej are served. The 
latter are either baked in the dish in which thej are to 
be presented at table, or in a mould from which tiiey 
maj be turned out. 

BOILED PUDDINGS.— The cloth used for these 
should be of stout and tolerably fine linen. Before 
putting the pudding into it, the cloth should be dipped 
in boiling water, and after wringing it out — not too 
dry, — ^it must be spread out smoothly inside a basin 
that will just hold the pudding, the edges of the cloth 
of course hanging over the sides of the basin. It is then 
pretty thickly dredged with flour over the part that 
will come in contact with the pudding. This dredg- 
ing prevents the pudding adhering ta the cloth, and so 
causing a difBculty in turning it out. When the pudding 
is placed in it, the edges of the cloth must be gathered 
together equally tight all round, and isecurely fastened 
with a piece of strong twine passed three or four times 
round them and tied. The neat round shape of the pud- 
ding depends upon the cloth being gathered up equally 
tight all round ; if this is not attended to, and one 
part happens to be slacker than the rest, the pudding, 
when it swells to flU the cloth, will have an unsightly 
protuberance moulded upon it by this looser portion. 



FOR BOILED PUDDINGS. 109 

Where the pudding consists of such material as 
dried fruits and farinaceous substances, which absorb 
water and swell considerably in the cooking, the cloth 
must not be tied close upon it, but so as to leave room 
for this increase of size without the risk of bursting. 
The extra room required varies with the kind of pud- 
' ding ; but in no case ought it to be greater than what 
the pudding, when cooked, will tightly fill; otherwise it 
will not turn out solid, but by absorbing too much 
water, become converted into an incoherent mess. This 
sort of pudding requires also a very long time to boil : 
— three hours at least for a small one of three pounds 
weight, and upwards according to size. It is a maxim 
with cooks genei'ally, that they cannot be boiled too 
long, aad indeed there is always less risk of spoiling 
them by over-cooking than by under-cooking. 

Meat and Fruit puddings must be tied as closely as . 
possible, and the former should not be boiled longer 
than is sufficient to cook the meat. 

To take the boiled pudding out of the cloth without 
breaking it : — Dip it into cold water for a minute or 
two, and then place it in a basin that will just contain 
it, and after untying the cloth and laying bare the pud- 
ding down to the edge of the basin, place the diE& on 
which is to be served, bottom upwards, on the top of 
it^ invert the whole so that the pudding may rest in 
the dish ; lift off the basin and remove the cloth care- 
fully. The use of the cold water is to chill and solidify 
the surface so that it may part from the cloth smoothly 
wi without being broken 

When puddings are boiled in a mould, this is either 
placed in a well-covered pot containing water to half 
the depth of the mould ; or, the mould being filled to 
the brim with the pudding, a cloth is stretched over 
its mouth and tied imder the bottom, and it is then 
boiled in a full pot. For some of the lighter kinds of 
mould-puddings the former mode is best adapted. 

Every pudding in a cloth should be boiled in plenty 
of water in a pot large enough to allow it to move 



110 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

about freely. The ebullition should be brisk and con- 
stant until finished. 

After use, the pudding-cloth must be washed per- 
fectly clean, rinsed in pure water, and thoroughly dried 
before laying it aside for a future occasion. 

StLct Dumpling, This is the simplest of all boiled 
puddings. Its ingredients form the basis of nearly the 
whole class. They consist of one part by weight of 
finely-minced suet to four of wheaten flour; which 
being well mixed together, are seasoned with a little salt, 
kneaded into a stiff dough with water, and the mass 
tl^en divided into solid dumplings or balls of about three 
inches diameter. These do not require a cloth, but are 
simply put into a pot of boiling water, and boiled for 
at least half an hour. The pot ought to be sufficient- 
ly large to allow the dumplings to move about in it, and 
they should be kept so moving by the brisk ebullition 
of the water, else they will stick together or adhere to 
the bottom of the pot, and so become burnt. These 
dumplings make a substantial accompaniment to either 
roast or boiled meat. With the former, slices of cold 
dumpling, re-warmed in the dripping pan while the 
meat is roasting, are excellent. 

Currant Dumplings are made in the same manner 
as the above, with the addition of currants (ad libitum) 
scalded, washed, and picked, a little sugar or treacle, 
and a slight seasoning of grated nutmeg and ground 
cinnamon. They are served either plain, or with caudle 
sauce ; or sliced, and with sugar, treacle, or jam spread 
over the slices. They may be made richer by using a 
larger proportion of suet, introducing an egg for every 
pound of the other ingredients, and making the dough 
with milk instead of water. The eggs should be well 
beaten and mixed with some milk ; which being worked 
up first, more milk may be added if necessary. 

Currant Pudding is composed as above, but with 
more eggs and milk ; and bread crumbs may be substi- 
tuted for the flour. The ingredients should be well 
mixed, and form a thick bat^r, which is then boiled 



PLUM PUDDING. Ill 

in a floored cloth securely tied, but so as to give the 
pudding room to swell. 

Flum Puddvng is similar to the last, but richer. 
Stone (that is to say, cut out the seeds of) a pound of 
raisins, and wash and pick free from stones the same 
quantity of currants. Mince very small a pound of 
beef suet (some marrow substituted for part of the suet 
is considered an improvement), and mix with this, in a 
large basin, a pound of stale bread-crumbs and half a 
pound of wheaten flour. Beat together in another 
basin siz eggs (seyen if small), and mix with them 
about half a pint of new milk. Pour this mixture 
among the suet and flour, and stir and beat the whole 
well together. Then add the currants and raisins, and 
a seasoning of one ounce of ground cinnamon, half that 
quantity of powdered ginger, a grated nutmeg, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a pound of sugar. This 
makes an excellent pudding, but it may be made richer 
by introducing more fruit and eggs, and an addition of 
a quarter of a pound of candied citron and lemon-peel 
out in small thin strips, with a glass of rum or brandy. 
— Another much cheaper, yet still very excellent Plum 
Pudding, may be made without eggs, by mixing equal 
quantities of grated carrot, boiled potatoes, wheat-flour, 
currants, and raisins, and seasoning them as above. 
Oatmeal may also be introduced into this instead of 
part of the flour. If Sultana raisins are used, the 
trouble of stoning them is avoided. 

Plum Pudding may be boiled either simply in a cloth 
or in an ornamental mould tied up in a cloth (see 
pp. 108-9.) In either way it requires very long and 
constant boiling ; — six hours at least for one as large 
as the above. It is also sometimes baked in a mould. 
In this case the mould should be buttered inside before 
pouring in the pudding ; and two hours baking will 
suffice. The pudding is improved if the mixture stands 
for a day previous to being cooked. 

It is a custom in England at Christmas time^ to or- 
nament the plum pudding with a sprig of holly stuck 



112 BOILED PUDDINGS. 

into the top, and after pouring a quantity of spirits 
over it, to set fire to this in the dish, and serve it biasing. 
Although this fiery sauce may amuse a Christinas juye- 
nile party, yet the pudding is thereby spoiled for those 
who dislike the spirit flavour. It is therefore better 
omitted, so that each person may help himself or not 
as he pleases to a small quantity of brandy or other 
liqueur with which to flavour his pudding. Caudle sauce 
13 also sometimes taken with plum pudding, though it 
is ofbener preferred plain. 

A good plum pudding will keep {if not eaten) a very 
long time. Slices of it broiled, or merely re-warmed 
before the fire, are excellent 

RoU or Bolster Pudding. Make about two pouxkds 
of suet and flour paste as directed for suet dumi^ing 
(p. 110.) Roll it out on a well floured paste board or 
slab, into a sheet about half an inch thick, and about a 
foot broad. Spread oter it any kind of jam or mar- 
malade, keeping this about an inch and a half within 
the edges. . Wet the edges, roll up the paste from the 
end, press the ends of the roll slightly so as to make 
the wetted parts adhere, roll it up in a floured cloUi 
about three inches wider than the length of the pud- 
ding, and tie pieces of string tightly round the project- 
ing ends of this. Boil it nearly two hours, and when 
done remove the cloth, cut the pudding into slices, and 
serve it either plain or with a sweet sauce poured over 
it. Kaisins and currants prepared as for plum pud- 
ding may be used instead of jam. A mixture of sugar 
and ground cinnamdn also, or even simply treade^ em- 
ployed in the same way, makes a very good Boll Pud- 
ding. 

Rice Pudding. Boil eight table-spoonfuls of well- 
washed rice in sufficient water to cover it, stirring it 
frequently to prevent its burning, until considerably 
swelled and becoming rather dry. Then mix with it 
two ounces of butter or finely-minced suet, the same of 
bread-crumbs, two beaten eggs, an>d enough oi milk to 
increase the bulk of the whole to a quart. Season this 



BOILBD PUDDINGS. 113 

mixture with sugar, grated nutmeg, and a little ground 
ginger, and boil it for an hour in a buttered basin or 
mouldy covered on the top hy a sheet of buttered paper, 
and tied up in a cloth. Currants may be added to 
this if liked. Serve with any sweet sauce. This pud- 
ding may also be baked in the dish in which it is to be 
served, in which case the top should be covered with 
thin slices of bread well buttered. It will not require 
so long baking as boiling. See p. 117. 

Ground Rice Pudding is made of nearly the same 
materials as the above. The ground rice should be 
boiled in the milk, along with some lemon-peel, which 
having imparted its flavour by the time the milk has 
become thickened, is then removed, and the other in- 
gredients except the bread-crumbs are added. A larger 
proportion of eggs may be used, and the flavour varied 
by a few pounded bitter almonds. The basin or mould 
should be quite filled with it, as it does not swell much 
in boiling. Serve with a sweet sauce or marmalade. 
This may also be baked like the preceding, but without 
a covering of bread and butter. 

Potato Pudding, Mash a pound of boiled potatoes, 
along with half a pound of fresh butter melted, and 
two ounces of sweet almonds scalded to remove the 
skins, and pounded. Mix with this five or six eggs 
beateAi up with a little milk, and season it with sugar 
and nutmeg. It may be boiled in a cloth, either with 
or without a buttered mould. Serve with sweet sauce. 

An excellent plain potato pudding, to be eaten along 
with roast meat, may be made with equal quantities of 
mashed potatoes and flour, mixed with a smaller pro- 
portion of minced suet, and seasoned with a little salt. 
This is boiled in a cloth. If intended to be browned 
below the roast, it consists merely of boiled potatoes 
mashed with a little milk and butter, and seasoned 
with white pepper and salt, and if liked, a small quan- 
tity of finely minced onion.

to swell, and boil them for half an hour, or till softened, 
when thej ought to fill the cloth tightlj. Then 
mash, and rub them through a sieve ; add some butter, 
and a seasoning of pepper and salt, m^ these well 
with the pudding, and tie it up in a poured doth, as 
closely as possible upon the peas, because thej will 
swell no more. Boil the pudding for an hour. One or 
two eggs may be mixed with it, especially if the peas 
are at all watery after their first boiling ; it will thus 
be made firmer. Mashed potatoes make an economical 
ingredient in peas pudding. 

Oatmeal Pudding consists of a mixture of minced 
suet and onion with oatmeal, seasoned with pepper and 
salt, bound together with beat eggs, and boiled in a cloth 
tied loosely. It affords an excellent opportunity for 
using up meat which has been used in making gravy, 
soups, &c. ; all that is required being simply to mince 
this finely and mix it with the other ingredients. It is 
a very good accompaniment to roast meat. 

Scotdi White Puddings are merely the above mixture 
minus the eggs, stuffed into well cleaned skins like 
sausages. Liver Puddings are the same, with the 
addition of boiled and grated ox-liver in the proportion 
of a fourth. Black Puddings contain, besides the oat- 
meal, &c., some ireshly-drawn bullock's- blood, salted, 
strained, and mixed with a little milk or broth! These 
puddings in skins are boiled (being pricked during that 
process to let out the air which expanding with the heat 
might burst them), after which they will keep good for 
a considerable time. When to be used, they are re- 
warmed by broiling. 

Scotch Haggis. This dish is a great favourite with 

unsophisticated Scotchmen, and is thus lovingly laude^l 

by their own poet Bums : — 

Fair fa* your honest Bonsy fece, ^ 
Great chieftaiii o' the puddin' race ! 
Aboon them a' ye tak' your place — 

Painch, tripe, or thairm : 
Ye are weel worthy o* a grace 

As lang 'b my airm. 



BOILED PUDDINGS. 11$ 

It is made thus : — Procure tlie stomach-bag and pluck 
of a sheep, this latter consisting of the heart, lights, 
and liver. Wash the bag well in cold water, and then 
plunge it into boiling water, after which it must be 
scraped yerj clean, taking care not to cut it. It is then 
laid in salt and water for a night. Wash also the pluck, 
and parboil it. Grate half the lirer and mince the rest 
of the pluck (rejecting any gristly or tough parts), and 
mix these with half their weight of finely chopped beef- 
suet, about a dozen small onions also minced, and two 
teacupfuls of oatmeal which has been well dried and 
toasted before the fire. Season the mixture rather 
highly with pepper, salt, and a little cayenne, moisten 
it with some of the liquor in which the pluck was boiled 
and a little lemon-juice, and put it into the bag. This 
should not be much above half filled, else it may be 
burst by the expansion of its contents. Press out the 
air, sew, up the orifice with a needle and thread, and 
put the haggis on the fire in a large pot of boiling 
water, with a plate in the bottom to prevent it from 
burning. Let it boil, but not violently, for three hours, 
pricking the bag with a large needle to let out the air 
if it appears very tightly distended. — An emasculated 
variety of this dish, which may be characterized per- 
haps as EnglUh Haggis, is in Scotland called 

Lamh^B Haggis, In this, besides the pluck, the lamVs 
fry is also used. This is composed of the small bowels, 
sweetbreads, and kernels. The small bowels must be 
slit up with scissors, and the whole pluck and fry 
thoroughly washed and cleaned, and then parboiled. 
They are now minced along with the kidney-fat in place 
of suet, and some young onions ; and seasoned with 
salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Instead of oatiheal, a thin 
batter, made with a couple of eggs beat up with half a 
pint of milk and sufficient fiour, may be mixed with 
the minced meat. It is boiled in the Iambus stomach- 
bag, prepared in the same way as described in the last 
receipt. _—

fresh or unripe fruit ; such as apples, pared, cored and 
sliced ; or young green gooseberries, red currantsi, rasps, 
cherries, drc, picked free from stalks and leaves. Mi^e 
a paste as in the receipt for suet dumpling, p. 110, 
(adding a yerj small quantity of carbonate of soda, 
which should be dissolved in the water), but roll it into 
a circular shape, and keep it considerablj thicker in 
the middle. One or two beaten eggs mixed with this 
paste makes it much lighter. Laj a floured cloth in a 
deep basin as directed on p. 108, and inside this lay the 
paste, pressing it lightly so as to make it lie close to 
the interior of the basin, which should be of such di- 
mensions as to allow the edges of the paste to project a 
little over the lip. Place the fruit inside t^ paste, 
along with a sufficient quantity of sugar to sweeten it, 
helping it up in the middle. Wet the edges of the 
paste, gather them together over the top, mould and 
press them till they adhere, and make the joining se- 
cure by laying over it a small eirde of paste rolled thin. 
Then tie the cloth quite closely over the padding, as 
the fhiit shrinks ratiier than swells. A Rhubarb pud- 
ding may be made in the same way; — the rhul)arb 
being peeled, and cut into half inch lengths: When 
apples are cooked thus, a seas<ming of cinnamon or 
cloves is an improvement These puddings, may also 
be boiled in a mould or basin ; — this being buttered 
inside, the pudding is constructed in it as above direct- 
ed, a piece of buttered paper laid on the top, and the 
cloth tied tightly over the whole. Thus prepared^ such 
puddings are less apt to break when being dished, be-* 
cause, instead of being round, they take the form of 
the basin or mould, and consequently have a larger 
basis to rest upon when turned out. 

Apple Dumplings consist of one apple each^ inclosed 
in a paste such as the above. The apple is pared, but 
not sliced ; the core is removed by means of a tubular 
cutter made for the purpose, and the interior filled 
with a mixture of sugar and ground cinnamon. It is 
then surrounded with paste moulded on to it with the 



BAKBD PUDDINGS. 117 

hands, and each dumpling is boiled in a separate cloth. 
These being smaller than puddings, need not be boiled 
quite so long. Apple dumplings made with boiled rice 
instead of paste, are called American Snouhballs. 

Meat Puddings. These are mostly made and boiled 
in the same way as fruit puddings, substituting small 
slices of meat, with appropriate seasonings for th^ fruit 
and sugar. Two pounds of meat will be enough, for 
which two hours and a quarter's cooking will be suffi- 
cient if the meat be full grown ; young meats require 
longer, and pork longest of all. Beefsteak Pudding i» 
seasoned by dipping the slices of meat in a mixture of 
pepper, salt, and flour ; and before closing the paste, a 
yerj little water is poured in. The addition of a few 
oysters is considered an improyement. 

Mutton, Lamb, Veal, Pork, Babbits, Kidneys, Salmon, 
'Cod, itc, may all be made into very nice puddings 
much in the same way ; — the condiments, seasonings^ 
time required in cooking, dec., being varied to suit the 
different viands used in their concoction, a competent 
knowledge of all which it is presumed the attentive 
student may have gathered from the previous chapters 
mi roasting and broiling. 

BAKED PUDDINGS.— These are baked either in 
the dish in which they are to appear at table, or in a 
buttered mould from which they are turned out when 
done. Of the former kind are the Rice puddings, de- 
scribed on pages 112-113 ; and the Plum Pudding de- 
scribed on page 11 1 is one of the latter. As a general 
rule, such puddings may be baked in half the time re- 
quired to boil them ; — ^this, however, of course depends 
greatly on the heat of the oven. Besides the above- 
specified puddings, there is an immense number of 
others, in nearly all of which eggs constitute the ingre- 
dient on which their firmness and lightness depend. 
The coagulation of the eggs takes place at nearly the 
same temperature as is required to solidify the albumen 
of meat (140^)» and a greater heat, especially if long 



118 BAKED PUDDINGS. 

continued, impairs the lightness of the padding. To 
cook most of the other ingredients, however, especially 
dry farinaceous substances, such as rice, sago, &c., they 
must be subjected for a considerable time to a much 
higher temperature ; hence it is generallj necessary to 
boil these till softened, before sidding the eggs. All 
baked puddings should be delicately browned on the 
top. The most simple is perhaps the 

Custard Pudding. It consists merely of new milk 
and eggs. The mUk, seasoned with sugar, cinnamon, and 
lemon-peel, is heated in a small saucepan oyer the fire 
until it begins to boil, when it is poured oyer the eggs 
well beaten in a basin, and rapidly stirred till mixed. 
This mixture, which is called a custard, is then baked 
in the dish in which it is to be served, with a little nut- 
meg grated over the top. The number of eggs required 
is from four ^o six, according to size, to each pint of 
milk. One or two of the eggs may be omitted, and 
its place supplied by a little flour, which should be 
thoroughly mixed with the milk before boiling it. 
This delicate pudding requires very little baking : — 
browning it in a dispatch before the fire will be suffi- 
cient. It is eaten either by itself or with jelly or mar- 
malade. Any kind of preserved fruit may be placed in 
it before baking. 

Bread Pudding. Boil milk, seasoned as above, and 
pour it over the cmmb of stale bread broken in smaH 
pieces in a basin. Cover the basin for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and then mash the bread into a fine pulp, 
stirring in a small piece of butter. Three or four weU- 
beaten eggs are then added, and if desired, a little 
brandy and a few currants ; and when the whole is well 
mixed^ bake it in the pudding dish in the oven for half 
an hour. Another bread pudding, or JBread-and-BtUter 
Pudding, is made by filling the baking dish with layers 
of thin slices of bread and butter without crust, and 
then pouring in a seasoned mixture of beat eggs and 
cold milk, till it reaches the level of the top layer. This 
should stand for three or four hours before going to the 



BAKED PUDDINGS* 119 

oven, in order that the hread maj soak and swell. Cur- 
rants, stoned raisins, sliced apples with sugar, or any 
kind of preserved fruit, maj be strewed between the 
layers of bread and butter. 

Tapioca, Sago, and Vermicelli Puddings, Simmer 
till quite soft, six tablespoonfuls of either of these ar- 
ticles in a quart of milk, stirring it almost constantly 
to prevent its burning. Then pour it into a basin, and 
stir in a little butter and three well-beaten eggs. Bake 
in. a buttered pudding-dish for half an hour ; or boil it 
for an hour and a half, in a mould or basin immersed 
to half its depth in a pot of boiling water ; — but the 
browned sur^Eice produced by baking looks much nicer. 
If boiled, an additional egg may be put in. 

Macarom Pudding is made precisely like the pre- 
ceding. The following mode of dressing macaroni is, 
however, by many preferred to this. It is first sim- 
mered in mUk, or veal-stock, and butter till quite tender, 
and then placed in the dish in which it is to be served, 
in layers alternately with grated Dutch cheese. The 
top is covered with cheese, a layer of bread-crumbs is 
sprinkled over this, and a number of small pieces of 
butter placed here and there over the whole. It is 
then baked in a dispatch till delicately browned. Beat 
•eggs, and minced fowl and ham, with a seasoning of 
pepper and salt, may be sdded to the above, when it 
may be cooked in a mould partly immersed in boiling 
water, turned ont upon a dish, and served with a rich 
meat gravy poured over it. 

Yorkshire or Baiter Pudding^ (to accompany roast 
meat). Mix together, very smoothly, a quart of new 
milk and as much flour as will make a thickish batter, 
Add a little salt and four well-beaten eggs, and mix 
these perfectly with the batter. Pour it into the 
bottom of a broad earthen pan, or tin dish, well but- 
tered, and bake it under a roast of meat, either in the 
oven (see p. 25) or before the fire. The pudding is 
enriched by the gravy and dripping from the meat, 
and when cooked, ought to be about an inch thick. 



120 BAKED PUDDINGS. 

If done before the fire, the under side reqaires to be 
browned either by turning it uppermost in the dish 
after the upper side is done, or bj placing the dish over 
the fire for a short time. It is senred either whole or 
cut in slices in a hot dish. For a boiled batter pudding 
the mixture of milk and flour should be stirred along 
with a little butter in a saucepan oyer the ^re till it 
becomes thickened, and then allowing it to cool before 
adding the beaten eggs. Ground rice, arrow-root, or 
potato flour, maj be substituted for the wheaten flour. 
It is boiled in a buttered basin and cloth, and may be 
served either plain as an accompaniment to roast meat, 
or with sweet sauce. If it is to be eaten with sweet 
sauce, the addition of apples cut in small pieces, or 
orange marmalade, is a great improvement 

Nottingham Pudding consists of a batter like the 
above, with a number of apples prepared as for apple 
dumplings (see p. 116) imbedded in it. 

Toad in a Hole, — This oddlj-named pudding con- 
sists of a Yorkshire pudding made with the addition 
of a little more flour than the abdve, and some finelj*- 
chopped beef-suet. In the centre of this is placed a 
solid piece of juicj lean beef, which maj be supposed 
to stand for the '' Toad." The remains of any kind of 
cooked meat or poultry, properly seasoned, may be re- 
warmed in such a pudding in place of the beef, as it 
does not require much baking. 

Apple Pudding consists of a mixture of stewed ap- 
ples passed through a sieve, beat eggs, and butter, — 
seasoned with grated lemon-peel, cinnamon, cloves, and 
sugar to taste, and a little lemon juice if the apples are 
not tart enough. Some bread Qrumbs or pounded bis- 
cuit may be added if the apples are very juicy. It 
may be baked in a dish lined with puff paste — (see 
p. 128.) Similar Puddings may be made with Rhvbarh, 
Green GoodeherrieSy or any other fruit either fresh or 
preserved. 

A Charlotte or French Fruit Pudding is made by 
lining a mould with thin slices of bread buttered on 



BAKED puddings: 121 

both sides, filling the interior compactly with sliced 
apples or other fhiit (not too juioj) properly sweetened 
and spiced, and covering the top with a single buttered 
slice .cut to fit the mouth of the mould. It is then 
baked in a slow oven till the bread becomes browned ; 
— a plate or flat cover, rather smaller than the interior 
of the mould, but corresponding in shape, may be 
placed on the top with a weight resting upon it while 
baking. When done, it is turned out upon a dish and 
served hot. Melted red-currant or other jelly may be 
poured round it in the dish as a sauce. A Malvern 
Pudding is made as above, but with the bread not but- 
tered, and the apples or other fruit tietued and put in 
hot. It is not baked, but merely allowed to stand with 
the weight on the top till cold and congealed, when it 
is ready for use.* Prunes (stoned) Budjigs may be em- 
ployed in this way. '- 

Besides those above described, there are a great many 
sweet &ncy puddings, which, being generally more orna- 
mental than useful, lie rather beyond the scope of this 
work. For this reason, and also because of our neces- 
sarily limited space we shall restrict ourselves to a few 
hints regarding the essential processes in their prepara- 
tion, — sufficient, we hope, to enable the intelligent 
housewife to make many an excellent pudding of her 
own invention, and at least to avoid such blunders as 
that committed by a certain English ambassador's French 
cook, who dismayed his master by setting before his 
Parisian guests (who had been promised a great treat) 
a Plum Pudding in the form of an immense tureenful 
of pasty plum-porridge ; apologizing at the same time 
for his inability to procure a vessel large enough to 
contain the whole. It turned out that, in giving his 
receipt, the ambassador, in his over-anxiety about the 
exact quantity of water in which the pudding was to be 
boiled, had forgotten to mention the pudding-cloth, 

1st. The firmness of all light puddings, as already 
mentioned, depends upon the eggs they contain. This 
arises from the property of eggs, more particularly of 



122 BAKED PUDDINGS. 

the whites, of coagulating at a temperatiire of about 
140<^, and of at the same time binding together all solid 
particles with which they are in contact ; — a property 
which to a certain extent they impart to any fluid in 
which they ra^j be dissolved. If the proportion of fluid 
be very large, and a greater heat be applied for a con- 
siderable time, the white of egg. separates as a floculent 
sediment, as is well exemplified in the clarifying of 
stock — (see p. 85.) In puddings, however, this separa- 
tion of the eggs from the fluid with which they are 
mixed must be prevented by using them in a much 
larger proportion, and taking care not to exp'ose the 
mixture to too high a temperature. Hence cooking in 
a mould placed in boiling water is better than baking 
for many of the lighter puddings, as a more gentle heat 
may thus be applied. The top may be browned after- 
wards before a brisk fire if desired. 

2d, The lightness of most fancy puddings is pro- 
duced by whisking the whites of the eggs into a stiff 
froth before mixing them with the other ingredients. 
This is done by rapidly beating them in a basin with a 
couple of forks tied together, or what is better, with a 
bundle of small twigs called a whisk. The inumerable 
little bells of air inclosed in this froth, and thus intro- 
duced into the pudding, cause it to swell or ** liae^ by their 
expansion when baked, thus producing a lightness simi- 
lar to that of bread. But, unlike the lightness of bread, 
which is mainly caused by the generation of a gas within 
the substance of the dough, that of puddings, so flar as 
it arises from this cause, lasts no longer than while the 
pudding remains hot, because, as it cools, the inclosed 
air shrinks again to its former bulk, and the pudding 
of course " faiUs** to such extent as its firmness will per- 
mit. Hence such puddings are much impaired if al- 
lowed to stand long after being ready. Even if kept hot, 
there is a danger of the solid parts of the pudding se- 
parating from the fluid, like curds from whey. 

3d, the biiUer also should be beaten with a knife or 
spatula until it forms a sort of cream. This seems to 



BAKED PUDDINGS. 123 

contribute to their lightness partly in the same way as 
whisking the white of eggs, — namely, by inclosing in 
the butter a considerable quantity of air, and partly by 
making it more easily mixed with the other ingredients. 

4th, Baked puddings should be cooked in a moderate 
oTen ; for if too quickly heated their surface becomes 
bound and hardened before it begins to rise ; if too 
slowly, the inclosed air expands and escapes before the 
pudding is sufficiently firmed to prevent it. 

We give the following receipt as an example of the 
mode of treatment and order of mixing of the different 
ingredients : — 

Prince A JherCs Pudding, — With half a pound of 
fresh hxxiiAT-becLten to a creamy mix by degrees an equal 
weight of loaf-sugar, pounded, dried, and sifted. After 
these have been well mixed, and beaten together, add 
first the yolks, and then the whites of ^ye eggs, the 
latter whisked separately into a strong froth. Then 
strew in lightlg half a pound of the finest well-dried 
floor, adding it gradually, so as to mix completely withotU 
forming knots. Last of all, put in half a pound of 
stoned raisins and a little grated lemon-peel. When 
thoroughly mixed, the pudding is poured into a well- 
buttered mould, which is immediately placed in a sauce- 
pan half full of boiling water, and boiled under a close 
cover for three hours. Such puddings may be orna- 
mented by lining the mould, previous to pouring in 
the mixture, with strips of candied orange-peel or citron 
arranged so as to form some fanciful pattern. 

A very light kind of pudding, called on that account 
a Souffle, owes its excellence almost entirely to the 
proper whisking of the eggs used in it. It is made by 
preparing a quart of melted butter (see p. 102) with 
milk which has been previously flavoured by boiling in 
it candied orange-flowers, vanilla, lemon-peel, or any si- 
milar flavouring sul)stance, adding the yolks of ten eggs 
and sugar to this while boiling, and when cold, lightly 
stirring in the whites of the eggs whisked to a perfect 
froth. The Souffle is then immediately poured into an 



124 OMELETS. 

appropriate dish or a prepared paste-mould or shell, 
carefidlj baked, and served hot. A Fondue is a pud- 
ding similar to the above^ except that the flarouring 
ingredient is grated cheese, and the seasoning salt, 
pepper, and a little cayenne, which are added along 
with the yolks of the eggs. The addition of boiled 
macaroni to this converts it into a Neapolitan Fondw. 



Omelets, The essential ingredient of these is eggs, 
— ^yolks and whites beaten together, but not to a froth. 
With this may be mixed almost any flaTOuring sub- 
stance, either animal or vegetable, which the taste of 
the cook may dictate ; such as boiled and minced ham 
or tongue, kidneys, shrimps, oysters, cheese, onions, 
parsley, thyme, sage, mushrooms, lemon-peel, &c. A 
judicious selection of such materials, minced or grated, 
mixed with a little butter and flour and appropriate 
seasonings, is stirred among the beaten eggs, but not 
in such quantity as to deprive the compound of its 
fluidity. The omelet is then saut6ed in a small pan 
containing a sufficient quantity of butter to prevent it 
from sticking to the bottom. When first placed over 
the fire, it should be rapidly stirred until the eggs 
begin to set. It should then be dravm together to the 
centre of the pan, so as to form a rather thick cake, 
and when this is browned on the under side, and com- 
pletely firmed, the process is finished. If the upper 
side is required to be browned, this may be done in 
front of the fire, or by means of a salamander or 'a hot 
shovel held over it ; or by turning the omelet, which 
may be accomplished by laying a plate above it, revers- 
ing it into the plate, and then carefully slipping it 
back into the pan. The chief considerations to be at- 
tended to in cooking an omelet are, to make it thick 
and to avoid over-cooking it ; otherwise it will be 
tough, leathery, and indigestible. It must be noted 
also, that as the eggs composing it require very little 
cooking, the other ingredients ought to have been pre- 
viously cooked, in those cases where otherwise they 



OMBLBT6. 125 

might be prejudioiaL The omelet is served upon a hot 
dish, with a rich meat gravy or savoury sauce poured 
over it. Sweet Omelets are made hj flavouring the 
eggs simply with sugar, — a few drops of essence of 
lemon, cinnamon, doves, or carrawaj, being added if 
deainxi Upon such an omelet any preserved fruits,- 
gooseberry, raspberry, or strawberry jam, <bc., may be 
spread before sending to table. 

A Pancake is generally a more simple preparation 
than an omelet. In this case the eggs, beaten up with 
a little nutmeg and salt, are mixed merely with flour 
and milk. The flour is mixed in the first, with some 
of the milk, in the proportion of about four ounces of 
flour to every three eggs, and more milk is then added 
till the batter is reduced to the consistence of thick 
cream. It is then saut^ed in the same manner as des- 
cribed above for omelets, except that it must not be 
stirred^ — a sufficient quantity being' poured into the 
pan at one time to make the pancake about one-eighth 
of an inch thick. It should be frequently shaken to 
prevent its adhering to the pan. When browned on 
one side, it is turned, either by lifting it with a broad 
slice similar to that used for fl^, or by skilfully tossing 
it up so as to make it turn in the air and catching it 
in the pan as it falls. When browned on the other 
side^ it is sprinkled with sugar, folded, laid in a hot 
dish and kept warm while the same process is repeated 
till all the batter is used. As very little butter is re- 
quired, afresh piece should be put into the pan for 
each pancake. They should be served hot and eaten 
immediately, as they cannot be kept any length of time 
after they are cooked without becoming heavy and in- 
digestible. The above is the usual mode of serving 
pancakes, but they may also have any sort of fruit- 
preserve spread between the folds instead of sugar. 
They are also very good plain, with the sauce described 
on p. 107, under Sharp Sauce, 

A very economical batter for pancakes may be made 
by substituting brisk small beer for the eggs and milk. 



126 OBNBRAL DIRECTIONS 

This batter must not stand long before using it, else 
the pancakes made of it will be heavy. If saut^ed 
and eaten immediatelj, however, thej will be found 
scarcely inferior to those made with eggs. 

Apple Fritters consists of thin slices of apple, peeled 
and cored, dipped in a pancake batter having a little 
more flour in it than the above, and fried separately in 
enough of hot lard to cover them. When lightly 
browned, they are drained, and served hot with pow- 
dered loaf-sugar strewed over them. Similar fritters 
may be made with preserved pears, plums, inic. Oysters 
are also used for fntters in the same manner. 



6ENSSAL DIBECnONS FOB PASTBT. 

Under this head are included all Pies and Tarts, and 
every variety of Bread, Cakes, Biscuits, &c. 

Of Pies and Tarts there are two kinds, namely those 
which are baked in a pie-dish, and covered with paste, 
and those distinguished by the name of Raised Pies, 
which have a complete casing or crust of paste. In 
both kinds the effect upon meat is very much the same, 
being somewhat similar to that produced by braising. 
As the heat of the oven, however, is generally greater 
than that employed in braising, it is all the more 
necessary that the meat for pies should be kept till in 
proper cooking condition. 

The Paste for Raised Pies requires to be firmer and 
more compact than that used for merely covered ones. 
It consists of wheaten flour made into a stiff dough with 
lard or dripping and water made boiling hot. This 
must be well kneaded and rolled upon a floured paste 
board into a sheet of a thickness proportioned to the 
size of the pie to be made from it. ^The under case of 
the pie is formed either by lining an opening pie-mould 
with this sheet, or by cutting from it properly shaped 
side and bottom pieces, and cementing these together 
with white of egg ; the lid or top is cut out and cemen- 
ted on in the same way after the pie is filled. In large 



FOR PASTRY. 127 

pies this is generally covered bj a layer of ornamented 
puff paste. If a mould has been used, it is remoTed 
when the pie is cooked. Large raised pies are now 
much less in vogue than they used to be, being much 
more difficult to make well, and less convenient than 
covered pies. The above paste^ however, answers for 
the cases of small mutton pies and fruit tarts. 

PomU for covering Meat Pies, Rub three ounces of 
butter into one pound of flour, adding a little salt if 
the butter is fre^. When these are thoroughly incor- 
porated, add as much cold water as will make them 
into a thick dough. Knead this quickly (but not too 
much) upon the paste board, which should be strewed 
with dry flour to prevent the paste from sticking to it. 
Roll it out to about three quarters of an inch in thick- 
ness, invert the pie-dish upon it, and cut away the pro- 
jecting margin of paste, which will thus leave a piece 
of the exact size required. When the dish is filled with 
the meat, which should be so arranged as to be highest 
in the centre, its edges are wetted, and covered with 
thin strips of paste rolled out of the trimmings of the 
cover ; these again are wetted, and the cover laid on 
imd pressed close down at the edges. The edges of 
the cover are now neatly pared and ornamentally scol- 
loped or notched ; — a few leaves or other fancy orna- 
ments are moulded from the superfluous scraps of paste, 
and laid tastefully on the top ; a small hole is made in 
the centre of the cover to permit the escape of the 
steam, and the pie is ready for the oven, — the heat of 
which, for all such pies, should be moderate. 
V Pvff Paste is lighter than either of the above. It is 
used chiefly for fruit pies and tarts. When baked, it 
ought to consist of a mass of thin, crisp, and slightly 
coherent laminae or scales. This structure is produced 
by introducing butter into a flour-and-water paste by 
the following process : — Weigh equal quantities of flour 
and fr^sh butter ; knead the butter under water till 
freed from all traces of butter-milk; mix the flour with 
the yolk of an egg, the juice of a lemon, a pinch of salt, 



128 PUFF PASTE. 

and as much cold water as will make it into a smooth 
paste of the same consistence as the butter. This paste 
must not be too much kneaded, else it will become 
tough by the coherence of the gluten of the £our. Strew 
the paste board with flour, and roll out j)he paste upon 
it to about half an inch in thickness, and after moulding 
the butter with the hands into the form of a flat oake, 
place this in the centre of the sheet of paste and fold 
the sides over it. Again roll out the paste with the in- 
closed butter into an oblong thin sheet ; fold this into 
three, roll it out again so that what were before the 
sides of the sheet may now become the ends, and re- 
peat this folding and rolling seven or eight times. The 
butter will thus become equally diffused through the 
mass in thin layers alternating with the paste. , Great 
care must be ta^en, during tlus operation, to keep the 
paste board, the rolling pin, and the hands, well dusted 
with dry flour, in order to prevent the surfisM^ of the paste 
from adhering to any of these and tearing off*, which it 
is very apt to do towards the end of the process, when 
the layers become very thin. Purticidar attention 
should likewise be paid to have the water-paste and 
the butter as nearly as possible of the same consistence, 
else by yielding unequally to the action of the rolling- 
pin, the layers will neither be of a uniform thickness, 
nor so regularly alternated as they ought to be. The 
lightness of this kind of paste arises from the steam 
generated while baking, raising up or blistering the 
layers of paste, which at the same time absorb the in- 
tervening layers of butter as these melt Hence puff- 
paste requires a rather hot oven, in order that this 
blistering, which of course takes place progressively 
from the surface inwards, may commence before the 
thin surface layers become sufficiently dried and har- 
dened to prevent it. The mode of covering a fruit pie 
with this paste is that already described for meat pies ; 
the decoration of the cover being of course made appro- 
priate to the contents. An intermediate, or sort of 
Half Puff PasUy may be made by rubbing about a 



MEAT PIES. 129 

quarter of the butter among the drj flour as in the 
previous receipt, and proceeding with the rest as al- 
ready directed. This is better adapted for those kinds 
of fruit which require a longer time in a slower oven. 
Puff-paste, while being made, should be bept as cold as 
possible, and it is even advisable in warm weather to 
use iced water, and also, about the middle of the pro- 
cess, to lay it for half an hour upon a tray or baking 
sheet set upon ice. 

When taken from the oven, meat pies may be glazed 
on the top by brushing them over, while quite hot, 
with white of egg thinned with a little water ; and 
fruit pies with sugar and water applied in the same 
way. The latter are " iced," by brushing them with 
white of eggs whisked to a froth, sprinkling over this 
a layer of finely-pounded loaf-sugar, and then returning 
them to oven for ten minutes. 



MEAT PIES.— The most frequent fault of these is 
being over-cooked. This must be avoided by attending 
to the heat of the oven, and proportioning the duration 
of the baking to the size of the pie. In an iron oven, 
a brick or two upon which to place the pies protects 
them from the extreme heat of the metal bottom, so 
that they are more equally and gently cooked. For 
pies intended to be eaten cold, veal and such young 
meat is best adapted, the gravy of which forms a strong 
jelly when cold. Forcemeat, or sausage-meat, frequent- 
ly forms an ingredient in such pies, either in the form 
of balls, or as a lining to the dish and a cover to the 
meat, under the paste. 

Beef-steak Pie, Tender rump steaks are dipped in 
a seasoning of pepper and ^It mixed with flour, and 
either laid fiat in the dish, or rolled up as olives. When 
the dish is properly filled, pour in a little water or 
gravy, cover with paste as previously directed (p. 127), 
and bake it for about an hour. 

Teal Pie may be made of chops from the back-ribs 
or loin. The bones should be removed, and a little 

K 



130 MEAT AND OTHER PIES. 

gravy prepared from them. Lay the chops flat in the 
dish in layers, strewing over each a seasoning of pepper, 
salt, flour, and finely-minced parsley. When filled, 
pour into the dish the gravy made from the hones, put 
on the cover, and hake the pie rather longer than an 
hour. A layer or two of ham is a great improvement 
in this pie. Cakes of well-seasoned sausage-meat may 
also he introduced. If intended to he eaten cold during 
warm weather, a little isinglass may he dissolved in the 
gravy to ensure its congealing. 

Mvtton or Lamb Pie is made precisely in the same 
way, hut omitting the ham. Sliced onions and pota- 
toes may he interspersed among the meat, and curry 
powder may be used in the seasoning. Lamb, however, 
should not be so highly seasoned as mutton. For small 
round raised mutton-pies, the meat is cut into small 
dice. Such pies may be re-warmed in the Dutch oven. 

Pork Pie, For this, small slices from the loin are best. 
They are seasoned with pepper and salt. A little mus- 
tard may be mixed with the gravy before pouring it in. 

Venison Pasty. Cut a breast of venison into small 
pieces, trimming away all bone, skin, £c. Season these 
with pepper, salt, mace, and allspice. Lay them in the 
dish ; and, if very lean, a few thin slices from the firm 
fat of a neck of mutton may be placed among them. 
Pour over them a gravy drawn from the trimmings ; 
cover with a rather thick crust neatly ornamented, and 
bake in a very moderate oven for an hour and a half. 

Rabbit Pie. Cut a nicely-cleaned rabbit into joints, 
and pile these in the pie-dish with half a pound of 
streaky bacon in inch-square pieces, and a seasoning of 
chopped onion and parsley, pepper and salt. Pour in 
a little water, cover, and bake for an hour. 

Pigeon Pie, Having well picked and cleaned the 
pigeons, cut off the heads and feet, turn the wings 
upon the back, and draw the legs inside under the 
skin. Put a piece of butter rolled in pepper and salt 
inside each bird. Place a layer erf beef-steaks or veal 
in the bottom of the dish, and upon this lay the pigeons, 



MEAT AND OTHER PIES. 181 

breasts upwards, and fill up the vacanciei^ with the 
livers and gizzards well seasoned. Pour in a little 
gravy or water, cover with paste, and bake for an hour. 
Some yolks of hard-boiled eggs may be added to this 
pie, and the feet of the pigeons are sometimes stuck 
into the crust as an ornament. A thin slice of ham 
laid on the breast of each bird improves the flavour. 
A Partridge Pie is made in the same way. 

Chicken Pie, For this a good plump chicken should 
be carved into joints, dusted with flour, and seasoned 
with chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. These joints 
are laid in a small pie-dish, somewhat in their natural 
order, but with a layer of sliced ham or bacon placed 
below the back, another between the back and breast, 
and several layers over the breast, which should be cut 
in half Pour in a little waiter or veal broth, and 
bake fully longer than an hour. An excellent Raised 
Pie, to be eaten cold, may be made with a fowl having 
the bones cut out as follows : — Make an incision down 
the back, dete^ch the sides, wings, and thigh bones, cut- 
ting off the legs and pinions below the first joint, and 
lastly separate the flesh from the breast bone — all 
which must be done so as to keep the skin and flesh as 
whole as possible. This is then filled with alternate 
layers of ham, veal, and forcemeat, and enclosed within 
a raised crust lined with forcemeat in a mould. This 
pie should be allowed to become quite cold before 
removing it from the mould, when it may be carved in 
firm slices cut across the whole way through. 

Gihlet Pie. Stew some well cleaned goose giblets 
(see p. 70) in broth, along with peppercorns, onions, 
and parsley. When the stew is cold, it is placed in the 
pie-dish with a beef-steak underneath, the gravy strained 
over it, and a few sliced boiled potatoes laid on the top. 
The crust may be made of half pufl'-pasto (p. 128-9). 
Bake it rather less than an hour. 

Eel Pie, After being skinned and cleaned, the eels 
are cut into two-inch lengths, and then simmered for 
a short time in broth, along with a bouquet of parsley 



132 FISH PIES, &C. 

and thyme,, and some onion and cloves. Drain the sauce 
from them, and mix with it about half as much brown 
sauce. Boil this mixture till reduced to a half, and 
strain it over the eels in the pie-dish. When cold, 
cover it, and bake for about an hour. 

Fish Pies may be made of salmon or almost any other 
good-sized fish. The fish should first be boiled in the 
usual way (see p. 47), then skinned and boned, and 
placed in layers in the pie-dish, each layer being 
sprinkled with a seasoning of pepper, allspice, mace, 
and salt if necessary. A little of the fish-liquor, en- 
riched by boiling in it the bones and skins, is strained 
over it when the dish is full The pie is then covered 
with a light paste, and baked rather more than an hour. 
The addition of a few shrimps, prawns, or oysters, im- 
proves the flavour of such pies. 

Oyster Patties. The cases for these are made by lin- 
ing little moulds, called pattypans, with thin sheets of 
pufi'-paste, placing in the inside a little ball of paper to 
support the cover, which is then cut out of a similar 
sheet of puff-paste and fastened on in the usual way. 
When baked about a quarter of an hour, the covers are 
taken off, and the paper ball removed, and replaced by 
some oyster sauce — (see p. 103.) This should be made 
rather thick, the oysters being cut into small pieces ; 
and when made quite hot, the patties are filled with it, 
and, the covers being replaced, served immediately. 
Similar patties may be made with almost any kind of 
cold cooked meat or fowls, minced and re-warmed in a 
thick highly-seasoned sauce. 



Mince Pie. — The material of this is a sort of sweet 
forcemeat, or seasoned mixture of fruit and meat. It 
consists of the following ingredients in equal propor- 
tions by weight : — Beef-suet, lean of roast-beef, apples 
pared and cored, stoned raisins, and well-cleaned cur- 
rants. Each of these, except the currants, requires to 
be finely minced separately, and then the whole are 
intimately mixed, along with half a proportion of raw 



FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 133 

sugar, a sixteenth part each of orange and lemon-peel 
minced and of ground cinnamon, half that quantity 
of ground ginger, a little salt, grated nutmeg, brandj 
and sherry. This mixture will keep good for a long 
time if tightly packed in a closely-covered jar. The 
pie is made by lining the bottom of a shallow dish with 
a thin sheet of puff-paste, filling it (but not too full) 
with the above mixture, and then covering it with 
another sheet of puff-paste. Bake in a quick oven for 
half an hour, or till the paste is properly risen and 
browned. They may be made of any size, from that of 
the smallest patty to that of a large dish. The smaller 
ones of course require less baking. 

FRUIT PIES and TARTS.— FruU Pies are covered 
in the same way as meat pies, puff-paste (see p. 127) 
being used for perfectly ripe juicy fruit such as rasps 
and currants, and half puff-paste (p. 128-9) for unripe 
fruit, which requires longer cooking. As all fruit 
shrinks very much when baked, plenty of it should be 
used, piling it high in the centre of the dish ; and in 
order to prevent the cover from sinking too much 
through this shrinking, it is a good plan to support it 
by a teacup placed inverted in the centre of the dish 
before putting in the fruit. The teacup will be found, 
when the pie is baked, to conts^in most of the juice, 
this having replaced the air expelled by the heat of the 
oven, but on slightly raising one side of it, the juice 
will flow down ready for use. Hard unripe fruits may 
be stewed in ajar placed in boiling water before put- 
ting them into the pie. There will thus be no uncer- 
tainty as to the quantity necessary to fill the dish when 
baked, as it will not shrink any more. The inverted 
teacup, however, should not be dispensed with, because 
the stewed fruit will be much too soft to sustain the 
middle of the cover, which in this case mav be made 
of puff-paste as the stewed fruit will not require so 
long baking. Sugar of course is an indispensable ingre- 
dient in these pies, the proportion varying according to 



134 FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 

the acidity of the fruit employed. When a pie is sent 
to a baker's to be covered and baked, it has often been 
found that less sugar will suffice if added in the form 
of a syrup when the pie returns. The syrup is poured 
in at the hole in the cover. 

Under the denomination of Tai'U are included all 
small round raised pies of fruit, as well as all uncovered 
tarts, both large and small, consisting of previously- 
stewed and pulped fruit, or jam or marmalade, baked in 
a dish lined with paste, and having an ornamental puff- 
paste border, or in a puff-paste casing like patties — 
(see p. 132). In making the raised crust for the former, 
a little sugar may be introduced. The latter are fre- 
quently decorated on the top with paste ornaments of 
any fanciful design, such as stars, flowers, &c. The 
paste for these ornaments consists of two parts of flour 
and one of pounded loaf-sugar moistened with eggs and 
well kneaded. They are baked separately from the tart 
in a slow oven, taking care not to let them get brown. 

Both pies and tarts are very good cold, in which case 
the stewed or preserved fruit for the latter need not be 
put into the paste until that has been baked. Cream 
or custard are usual accompaniments to pies and tarts 
whether hot or cold, and a basin of pounded loaf-sugar 
should also be placed on the table for those for whom 
the fruit may not have been sufficiently sweetened. 

Apple Pie, For this, tart juicy apples are the best. 
They must be pared, sliced, and cored, and put into 
the pie-dish in layers, each layer sprinkled with sugar 
and appropriate spices, such as ground cinnamon, 
cloves, ginger, &c. A quince sliced among the apples, 
or a little quince marmalade, greatly improves the fla- 
vour of apple pie. If the sliced apples have to be kept 
any length of time before being used, they ought to be 
thrown into cold water, or covered up closely, else they 
will become discoloured. Cover with the same paste as 
for meat pies (see p. 127), or with half puff-paste (see 
p. 128-9), and bake for an hour or less according to size. 
. Gooseberry Pie, Clip off the heads and. stalks of 



FRUIT PIES AND TARTS. 135 

unripe gooseberries. Rub tbe fruit clean in a cloth ; 
pile it high in the dish, along with a considerable 
-: quantity of brown sugar ; add a very little water, cover 
with half puff-paste (p. 128-9), and bake for upwards of 
an hour. The gooseberries may be previously stewed, 
in which case they may be covered with a rich light 
puff-paste, and baked for a shorter time. The riper 
they are,' the more sugar and longer baking will goose- 
berries require, because then the skins become both very 
acid and tough. This remark applies also to most other 
fruit of the same class. 

Rhvharh Pie, Use freshly-pulled rhubarb. Cut off 
all the leaf; strip the skin from the stalks, and cut 
them into half-inch lengths. With these the pie is 
made precisely as the preceeding. It is of considerable 
advantage to stew the rhubarb before putting it into 
the pie-dish, because it shrinks so much in cooking 
that it is hardly possible otherwise to get a full pie. 

Red Currants, Easpberries, Cranberries, Cherries^ 
Damsons, Plums, dec, all make excellent pies. They 
must be picked free from stalks and leaves, gently wiped 
clean if necessary, and piled high in the dish, with 
plenty of sugar, especially the more juicy fruits. The 
stone-fruits are best cut open and the stones removed, 
and they may be used rather unripe. The others are 
best when perfectly ripe. Rasps and red currants 
make an excellent mixture. 

Small Covered Tarts, in a raised crust. For these 
the fruit is treated precisely as above directed for pies. 
The crust is shaped in small moulds with sloping or 
perpendicular sides. The best decoration for them nn 
a simple notching of the edge and a sugar icing, which 
may be applied before putting them into the oven, as 
these small tarts do not require long baking. 

Open Tarts, For these, the fruit if fresh must be 
previously stewed and sweetened, — apples and green 
gooseberries being also mashed to a pulp. Large tarts 
are made by lining a shallow dish with rich puff-paste, 
placing an additional layer on the edges, which should 



136 TARTS, PUFFS, &C. 

be notched and otherwise ornamented, filling the centre 
with stewed fruit, jam, or marmalade, and baking for 
half an hour. If to be eaten cold, the fruit is better 
not put in until the paste is baked. The top may be 
ornamented with small bars or straws cut from a thin 
sheet of puff-paste, and delicately baked, or with the 
ornaments described on p. 134. For small open tarts, 
the cases are baked in buttered pattypans and filled 
afterwards. If desired hot, they may be warmed before 
the fire or in a slow oven. 

Tuffs are made simply by placing a spoonful of pre- 
served or stewed fruit in the centre of a circular piece of 
puff-paste, wetting the edges, folding it half over, and 
slightly pressing the wetted parts to make them ad- 
here. The top may be ornamentally marked, and iced. 
Bake, with a sheet of buttered paper beneath, for half 
an hour or less, according to size. The form of the 
above is of course semicircular, but this may be varied 
by using differently-shaped pieces of paste. 

CAKES, BISCUITS, <ko.— In this department of 
cookery also, there is considerable scope for the ^zercise 
of invention ; and the ingenious housewife who has ac- 
quired a knowledge of the various materials commonly 
employed, together with some idea of the proportions in 
which they may be mixed, will hardly go wrong if she 
follows the suggestions regarding the proper treatment 
of the eggs and butter already given with reference to 
fancy puddings (see pp. 121-2-3), to which we now 
add the following : — Whisking the eggs in a tin basin 
set in warm water or near the fire, greatly facilitates 
the formation of the froth. The flour and pounded 
sugar ought to be well dried and sifted. Almonds are 
blanched by scalding them, and then rubbing off* the 
skins. Candied citron and other peel should be cut in 
long thin strips. 

With regard to the cooking of the . cakes, &c., the 
following may be attended to : — As a general rule, small 
fancy biscuits and cakes require a rather quick oven 



CAKES AND BISCUITS. . 137 

until thej have risen and become firmlj set ; the heat 
may then be reduced by partly opening the oven door, 
or otherwise. Most large cakes, however, require a 
moderate oven, and to prevent their sur&ce being too 
much dried and browned, a sheet of paper may be laid 
over them. To ascertain if a large cake be sufficiently 
baked, probe it in the centre with a clean knife ; — if 
the blade, when withdrawn, continues dry and clean, 
the cake may be removed from the oven ; if it is 
smeared, the baking must be continued a Httle longer. 

Any necessary departure from the foregoing direc- 
tions is specially mentioned in the following receipts. 
A knowledge of the mere names of the materials, their 
mechanical properties, and practicable proportions, is of 
course all that can bo gathered from any Jist of receipts ; 
but an intimate acquaintance with their various ^avour^ 
is also essential for one who would invent a cake. 

Besides those which are baked, there is a large class 
of cakes and scones which are cooked on the Oirdlc. 
This utensil must be kept very clean and free from rust, 
and should be thoroughly heated before using. 

All cakes and biscuits should be kept well covered 
up from the air, — large cakes, to prevent their becom- 
ing dry j small crisp cakes and biscuits, to prevent their 
becoming moist and soft. If this softening does happen, 
however, the original crispness may be partially restored 
by re-warming in the oven or before the fire. Such 
cakes <&c. are, however, best when fresh made. 

Pound Cake, With nine whisked eggs, mix a pound 
each of pounded loaf-sugar, beaten fresh butter, and 
flour. Add these gradually in the order here given, 
beating up the mixture well with a horn spoon after 
each addition. Stir in a few chopped almonds and a 
flavouring of essence of lemon. Bake in a buttered 
tin pan for an hour. A very good cake may also bo 
made with only half the above proportions oT sugar, 
butter, and eggs ; the whites of the eggs, whisked sepa- 
rately, being added last in order. 

"Plum Cake may be made by adding to the above 



138 CAKES AND 

half a pound each of cleaned and dried currants, stoned 
raisins, and candied lemon and orange-peel, together 
with a seasoning of nutmeg and cinnamop. 

Seed Cake consists of the ingredients of pound cake, 
with the addition of an ounce of carrawaj seeds. Some 
candied orange-peel may also be used in it, and the 
top may be strewed with carraway comfits. 

Rice Cake. With six whisked eggs mix half a pound 
each of finely-ground rice and sifted loaf-sugar, and 
then add a quarter of a pound of butter. Flavour with 
essence of lemon, beat the whole together for a quarter 
of an hour, and bake immediately in a buttered pan. 

Soda Cake, Mix together dry, one pound of flour, 
half a pound of sugar, and a teaspoonful of carbonate 
of soda, and then rub^into this six ounces of fresh but- 
ter. Add half a pound of cleaned currants, and, if de- 
sired, a few blanched and chopped almonds, and some 
strips of candied lemon-peel. Make this dry mixture 
into a stiff batter with about half a pint of warm milk 
whisked up with three eggs. Beat the whole well to- 
gether, and bake it immediately. Instead of milk and 
eggs, buttermilk may be used, with which the other in- 
gredients should be made into a soft dough. 

Sweet Cake. Procure two pounds of fermented dough 
ready for the oven, and with this mix quickly three 
quarters of a pound of beaten butter, , half a pound of 
sugar, and the same quantity of currants. This may 
be seasoned with a little ground cinnamon and grated 
nutmeg, or allspice, and carraway seeds. Work the 
whole well together with the hand, and bake it imme- 
diately in a buttered pan. Dripping, warmed with a 
little new milk, may be used instead of the butter. 

Sponge Cake. Whisk well together, in a basin set 
in warm water, a pound of finely-pounded sugar and 
twelve eggs. When these have become warm and ra- 
ther thick, remove the basin from the hot water, and 
continue whisking its contents until quite cold. Then 
stir in lightly one pound of sifted flour and the rind of 
a lemon chopped very finely, or grated upon one or two 



SCOTCH BUN. 139 

lumps of sugar, which are then pounded. When per- 
fectly mixed, pour it into a pan or mould prepared 
by smearing the inside with butter and then dusting 
it with as much dry flour as will adhere to it. Bake it 
in a moderate oven for an hour, or less if the form of 
the cake be not compact. Small Sponge-Cakes or Savoy 
Biscuits may have a larger proportion of sugar, and 
have powdered sugar sifted over them. They are baked 
in small moulds prepared as above with butter and 
finely-sifted sugar. The sponge-cake moulds should not 
be above half filled, as the mixture rises considerably 
while baking. Potato-flour may be partly or wholly 
substituted for wheat-flour in the above. 

Scotch Bun, With two pounds of baker's dough 
mix three quarters of a pound of butter, and reserve 
about a quarter of this mixture to cover the bun with. 
To the rest add two pounds of stoned raisins, a pound 
and a half of cleaned currants, a quarter of a pound of 
blanched almonds, two ounces each of candied orange and 
lemon-peel in small dice, and a quarter of an ounce each 
of pounded cloves, Jamaica pepper, and ginger. Knead 
these thoroughly together with the hand, and mould 
the mixture into the form of a thick round cheese. For 
the cover or casing, add a little flour to the reserved 
piece of dough if not stiff enough, and then roll it out 
into two thin circular pieces, — one a little smaller than 
the bottom of the bun, and the other considerably 
larger, to cover the top and sides. Lay the bun, bottom 
upwards, in the centre of this larger piece ; place the 
smaller piece on the bottom, and gather up the margin 
of the former all round ; fold it over the edges of the 
bottom so as to join that of the other, wetting both 
margins to make them adhere. Place the covered bun 
upon a doubled sheet of grey paper floured, and bind 
a band of the same round the sides to preserve the 
shape. Prick it all over the top rather deeply with a 
long needle, and bake it in a moderate oven. 

Shortbread, Melt a pound of butter, either fresh or 
salt, and pour it, free from sediment, into a mixture of 



140 SHORTBREAD. 

a pound and a half of flour with a quarter of a pound 
of powdered sugar, — stirring together quickly. Knead 
this (but not too much) with a quarter of a pound more 
flour upon the paste-board, and when mixed mould it 
into a cake of any desired shape, three quarters of an 
inch thick. Notch or scollop the edge, and ornament 
the top with carraway comfits and strips of candied 
orange-peel, arranged in any fanciful design. Bake it 
on a floured sheet of white paper placed upon a tin 
baking sheet in a moderate oven. Scotch Petticoat 
Taih consist of a large round cake of shortbread rather 
thinner than the above, cut, before baking, in a peculiar 
manner : a small circle is stamped out of the centre 
with the mouth of a cup or tumbler, and the remaining 
piece is cut into eight segments from the middle. Each 
of these may be decorated as above. They are served 
at the tea-table in their original arrangement. For this 
a little warm milk may be added to the oiled butter. 

Tea Cakes, Make a paste with half a pound of flour, 
a quarter of a pound of beaten butter, rather more of 
loaf-sugar, one ^gg, and some grated lemon-peeL Roll 
it out thin, and cut small round cakes from it. Brush 
them over with white of eggy sift pounded loaf-sugar 
over them, and bake upon a floured baking sheet in a 
quick oven. These cakes may be flavoured with car- 
raway seeds, cinnamon, allspice, &c., instead of lemon- 
peel. They may also be baked upon a girdle with 
paper under and a tin cover over them. Very good 
simple cakes may be made by seasoning as above with 
sugar, carraway seeds, and spice, a common pie-crust 
or puff'-paste, to whioji a few currants may be added. 
Scraps of such paste left over when a pie or tart is 
covered, mav thus be profitably used up. Bake in 
either of the above methods. 

French Biscuit. Take equal weights of eggs, sugar, 
and flour. Whisk the whites and yolks of the eggs 
separately. With the froth of the whites beat up the 
sugar, the flour, and then the yolks. Drop the batter 
in round shapes upon buttered sheets of paper. Bake 
in a quick oven. 



CAKES AND SCONES. 141 

Almond Biscuits are made by pounding about two 
ounces of blanched and dried sweet almonds and half 
an ounce of bitter almonds along with half a pound of 
loaf-sugar in a mortar ; and when these are intimately 
blended, beating them up with the whites of two eggs 
whisked to a froth, and two ounces of finely-ground 
rice. This light batter is dropped in table-spoonfuls 
upon a baking-sheet, and baked in a slow oven. 

Macaroons are made similarly to the above, but omit- 
fmg the rice and bitter almonds, and adding the whites 
(not previously whisked) gradually, while pounding the 
other ingredients in the mortar. 

Cc^ces or Scones for Breakfast, Make one pound of 
flour into a stiff dough with warm milk slightly salted, 
and having one ounce of butter melted in it, to which 
add two beaten eggs. This dough must be well kneaded 
and then placed covered up before the fire for half-an 
hour, after which it is rolled out thin, stamped into 
round cakes, and cooked over the fire on a girdle 
dusted with flour. These are served hot, and buttered. 
Similar scones may be made without eggs, using an 
ounce more butter (which should be rubbed cold into 
the dry flour), and making the dough with cold butter- 
milk. A little carbonate of soda previously well mixed 
with the dry flour will convert this into dough for Soda 
Scones. These must be made rather thicker. Their 
lightness is occasioned by the acid of the butter-milk 
slowly effervescing with the carbonate of soda within 
the dough, which thus becomes puffed up with innu- 
merable small bubbles of carbonic acid gas. 

Barley-meal Scones, Into a quart of boiling milk, 
seasoned with a tea-spoonful of salt, stir gradually as 
much barley-meal as will make a soft dough ; mix this 
with a little more barley-meal on the paste-board, roll it 
out rather thin, cut the scones about the size of a saucer, 
bake them on both sides upon a girdle, and as they 
are done, pile them one upon the other in a plate before 
the fire to keep soft and hot. Serve them hot upon a 
napkin. These are excellent breakfast scones. 



142 CAKES, SCONES, &C. 

Potato Scones are made of mashed boiled potatoes 
kneaded into a stiff dough with flour and a little l)utter 
and salt ; roll out, cut, and bake like the preceding. 

Oatmeal Cakes may be made simply by kneading 
oatmeal with water, very slightly salted, into a stiff 
dough, rolling this out on the paste-board into a thin 
cake, and then baking it on the girdle. If preferred 
dry and crisp, the cake should be made as thin as 
possible, browned slightly on one side on the girdle, 
and then toasted on the other side before the fire in a 
toaster which hooks on to the front of the grate, and 
has a back to support the cake. If wanted soft, it 
should be made rather thicker and be quickly browned 
on both sides on the girdle. Butter or good dripping 
is an improving addition in oatmeal cakes. It should 
be melted in boiling water, and the meal-dough made 
with this while hot. 

Cheese Cakes. Drain the whey from two quarts of 
milk curdled with rennet. Rub the curd through a 
sieve ; mix with it four ounces of beaten fresh butter, 
three ounces of pounded loaf-sugar, the same of cleaned 
currants, half-an-ounce of sweet almonds and three or 
four bitter ones blanched and pounded, three whisked 
eggs, a little minced citron and grated lemon-peel, with a 
glass of brandy. This mixture is baked in patty-pans 
lined with puff-paste. Rice Cheese-Cakes are made with- 
out curd, and consist of equal quantities of ground rice, 
pounded loaf-sugar, and beaten butter, with the beaten 
yolk of one egg for every two ounces of the mixture, 
and half that quantity of beaten whites. This is fla- 
voured with a little brandy and grated lemon-peel, and 
baked as above. 

Gingerbread, With six ounces of beaten butter mix 
the same quantity of brown sugar, one pound of flout, 
one pound of treacle, two beaten eggs, and a quarter 
of an ounce of carbonate of soda. For spicing, mix in 
two ounces of carraway seeds and an ounce and a half 
of ground ginger. A little candied orange-peel may 
be added. The mixture should stand for a night, and 



BRRAD. 143 

next day be well worked together, and baked in a 
shallow buttered tin in a slow oven for two hours. 

Bread, This is so generally procured ready-made 
from the baker's, that a receipt for it here will hardly 
be thought necessary. It may however be interesting 
to know the nature of the process upon which its 
lightness depends. The fermentation of bread is iden- 
tical with that by which wine, beer, ale, «fec. are made, 
and wort prepared for the distillation of spirits. It 
consists of a chemical transmutation, by means of yeast, 
of the sugar and part of the fibrine or gluten of the 
wheat flour, into carbonic acid gas and alcohol, which 
being diffused through the dough and expanded by the 
heat of the oven, puff up the bread and render it light 
and porous. Sourness in bread is occasioned by delay- 
ing to bake the fermented dough until a second process 
has commenced, by which vinegar is generated from 
the alcohol ; hence it is necessary to attend particularly 
to the time required to ferment the dough. Unfer- 
mented bread is made light by means of carbonate of 
soda and a dilute acid. The soda is intimately mixed 
with the dry flour, and with this the dough is made 
with the acid and water. The carbonate of soda meet- 
ing with the acid within the dough, gives off its car- 
bonic acid with a slow effervescence ; this gas raises the 
dough in the same way as in fermented bread, while 
the soda forms a new compound with the acid. If mu- 
riatic add be employed in the proper chemical propor- 
tion, this new compound is common salt, which is thus 
useful in seasoning the bread, and no other need be 
used. Unfermented bread is said to be more economi- 
cal than the other, as in it there is no destruction of 
nutritious substances to produce the carbonic acid gas. 
It is also recommended to persons liable to heartburn, 
which the use of fermented bread is apt to occasion, as 
it is sometimes not sufliciently baked to check its ten- 
dency to become sour. 

Plain biscuits are not fermented, but are made 
simply with a stiff well-kneaded dough of flour and 



144 JELLIES. 

water, properly seasoned with salt. They are baked 
in a quick oven, being pricked to prevent their being 
blistered by the steam formed within them. The va- 
rious kinds of French fancy bread are made by the 
introduction of milk, butter, and eggs, into the dough 
before fermenting it. Their appearance is varied by 
the moulds or pans in which they are baked. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

JELLIES, FBESEBVES, PICKLES, &c. 

Of Jellies there are various kinds. The basis or ge- 
latinizing principle of some is animal gelatine, either 
in the form of Isinglass, or prepared Gelatine, or as 
extracted from Calves' feet, <fec. In others it is a 
vegetable substance, such as Arrowroot, or some other 
variety of starch. In Fruit Jellies, which however may 
rather be classed with preserves, it is a substance called 
Pecline, which abounds more or less in nearly all fruits. 

The jelly-bag used for straining jellies is made of 
flannel. It should be conical in form, about sixteen 
inches deep, closely sewed, and bound round the mouth 
with broad tape, to which four tape loops are attached, 
by which, when in use, it is suspended from a wooden 
stand or frame. This consists of four upright bars 
three feet high, connected at the top and near the 
bottom by cross bars about ten inches long. A couple 
of heavy chairs placed back to back about' a foot apart 
make a very good substitute for this frame. Before 
using it, the bag should be dipped in warm water 
and wrung out ; after use, it should be turned inside 
out, steeped in cold water, washed with soap, well 
rinsed, and dried. 

Clear Galfs-Foot Jelly. The stock for this should 
be prepared the day previous to being used. Set on 
the fire, in nearly three quarts of water, two calf-feet. 



JELLIES. 145 

well cleaned and cut in pieces. Keep them simmering 
for five hours, or until the water is reduced about 
one half, skimming occasionally. Then pass the liquor 
through a hair-sieve into a basin, and allow it to cool 
and become firm. Next day remove the oil and fat, 
and wipe the jelly quite clean. Place in a stew-pan 
half a pound of loaf-sugar, the juice of four lemons and 
the rinds of two, a gill of sherry, the same of water, 
and the whites and shells of five eggs. Whisk these 
together imtil the sugar is melted, then add the jelly- 
stock cut in pieces, and continue whisking the whole 
over the fire until boiling. Then after it has stood off 
the fire closely covered for half an hour to settle, strain 
it through a clean flannel jelly-bag hung before the 
fire. If not quite clear, which the first that comes 
through may not be, return it to the bag. When it 
is perfectly transparent, it is ready to be poured into 
moulds or glasses, which should be quite filled. To 
remove it when set, from the mould, place this for a 
minute or so in lukewarm water, strike the sides of it 
gently, and when the jelly seems loosened, place the 
dish on which it is to be served, on the top, turn the 
whole over, and carefully remove the mould so as not 
to lift or break the jelly. All jellies in moulds are 
dL^hed in the same way. 

A plainer kind of Calf-Foot Jelly may be made 
with ale and vinegar instead of wine and lemon-juice. 
The stock may also be prepared from Cow-keels, They 
produce a jelly, which though firm and clear, is perhaps 
not quite so free from meat flavour. The flavour may 
be varied by substituting for the wine some maraschino, 
noyeau, cura9oa, &c. Spices, such as coriander seeds, 
allspice, cinnamon, and cloves, may likewise be used. 
Orange and Lemon Jellies are made by flavouring the 
clarified stock with a syrup of the juice of these fruits 
with some of their rind boiled in it. A little cochineal 
is sometimes used to impart a richer tint to the jelly. 

Similar Clear Jellies may be made with isinglass, 
gelatine, or hartshorn shavings ; four and a half ounces 

L 



14(> JELLIES. 

of either of the first, or half a pound of the last, being 
equivalent to the above number of calf's feet. Thej 
are treated precisely in the same way. 

More ornamental jellies may be made by introducing 
ripe or preserved fruits cut in slices and arranged in 
layers alternately with the jelly, or otherwise imbedded 
in it. In doing this, however, each layer of jelly must 
be allowed to set before the next one of fruit is added, 
else the two will become mingled, thus spoiling the 
appearance of the whole. 

Blancmange, This is an opaque white jelly made 
with isinglass and milk. Simmer an ounce and a 
half of isinglass in a quart of new milk, along with 
some cinnamon, nutmeg, and lemon-peel. Stir the 
whole over the fire till the isinglass dissolves, sweeten 
it to taste with loaf-sugar, and then strain it through 
a muslin sieve. After allowing it to stand to settle for 
a few minutes, pour it into a mould, keeping back the 
sediment. When cold and firm, it is turned out as 
above directed. A paste of pounded sweet almonds, 
with four or five bitter ones, may be added to this be- 
fore straining it. 

Very similar Blancmanges may be made with arrow- 
root, ground rice, or Irish moss. Three tablespoonfub 
of arrowroot will be sufficient for a quart of milk. It 
should be smoothly mixed cold with a smaU quantity 
of the milk, and when the rest, already sweetened, is 
boiling, this is added to it. The whole immediately 
becomes thickened, and after being briskly stirred 
over the fire for about three minutes, it is ready for 
pouring into the mould. This jelly may be flavoured 
with essence of lemon, pounded almonds, &q. There is 
an excellent and cheap substitute for arrowroot called 
Pithina, which may be used exactly in the same way. 
Rice Blancmange requires very much longer boiling to 
make it smooth, during which it must be constantly 
stirred to prevent its burning. Irish or Iceland Moss 
is a kind of sea-weed. It is sold by the druggists in a 
dried state. Before using, it should be picked clean. 



PRESERVES. 147 

and then steeped in cold water ]for twelve hours at 
least. It swells up by absorbing a great deal of water, 
and becomes very soft. If then drained and boiled for 
twenty minutes or so in milk, it dissolves almost en- 
tirely, and converts the milk, when cold, into 6. firm 
jelly. An ounce of the Moss will suffice for a pint and 
a half of milk. It should be constantly stirred while 
boiling, sweetened, and seasoned to taste with stick- 
cinnamon or other spice. Before pouring it into the 
mould, it should be strained through mushn to remove 
^ any fibres that may remain undissolved. Red currant 
jelly forms an agreeable garnish and accompaniment to 
a dish of blancmange. 

PRESERVES.— Under this head are included FruU 
Jellies, Jam, Marmalade, and Fruits preserved whole. 
The preserving ingredient in them all is sugar. The 
fruit should always be gathered on a dry day, and, par- 
ticularly for preserving whole, ought to be perfectly ripe 
and in good condition. For all kinds of Jam, equal 
weights of sugar and fruit are about the average pro- 
portions required, — sweet luscious fruit, such as straw- 
berries, of course requiring rather less sugar, and very 
tart fruit, like red currants, a little more. The fruit 
must be picked free from all stalks, leaves, <&c. Plums, 
damsons, and cherries should be stoned, the larger kinds 
of plums cut in quarters, and those with tough or acid 
skins may be scalded and peeled. The fruit may be 
boiled with the sugar in the preserving-pan, for a time 
varying from fifteen minutes to half an hour, according 
to the kind of fruit ; thus tough-skinned gooseberries 
will require the full time, while strawberries, rasps, <kc. 
will take less. During this process, all scum that rises 
should be quickly skimmed off. If the weather pre- 
vious to gathering has been unusually dry, a little water 
may be added. The addition of some red-currant juice 
to strawberry jam imparts a tartness in which that pre- 
serve is otherwise deficient. An admixture of rasp- 
berries greatly improves the flavour of red currant jam. 



148 PRESERVES. 

A few clbyes make an excellent addition to gooseberry 
jam. The preserving-pan is of brass, and must be kept 
scupulousl J clean and free from verdigris, and be washed 
out with vinegar immediately before using. A per- 
forated skimmer is the best instrument for removing 
the scum. When potted, all kinds of jam should stand 
till quite cold before being covered. 

Feuit Jellies. — Those from ripe juicy fruits aro 
best made as follows : — 

Red Currant Jelly, Having freed the fruit from 
stalks, leaves, <i^c., mash it so as to break every currant. 
Then suspend it in a clean flannel jelly-bag, and set a 
basin beneath to catch the clear juice as it trickles 
through ; the bag must not be squeezed, else the juice 
will be turbid. Boil the juice for a quarter of an hour 
in the preserving-pan, with loaf-sugar in the proportion 
of a pound to each pint, — carefully removing all scum 
as it rises. The best test of its being sufficiently boiled 
is to cool rapidly a tablespoonful in a saucer placed in 
cold water : if it forms a weak jelly it is boiled enough, 
but if it remains quite fluid, the boiling should be con- 
tinued. It should be potted in small g^pots. Rasps in 
the proportion of a third, mashed along with the cur- 
rants, greatly improve the flavour of red currant ^elly. 

For Apple Jelly, the apples, pared, cored, and sliced, 
must be stewed before mashing. A mixture of apples 
and damsons produces a jelly of a rich ruby tint, with 
an agreeable tartness which simple apple jelly wants. 

Gooseberry Jelly is made from unripe green fruit, 
which also requires to be stewed before mashing. 

The fruit pulp from which the juice has been drained 
to make jellies as above desdrib^d, will in most cases 
make a very good, though coarse, kind of Jarriy well 
adapted for Roll Puddings, &c., by being boiled up with 
sugar as previously directed for jam. 

Rhubarb, being deficient in pectine, will not produce 
a jelly ; but a very palatable sort of jam, which keeps 
well, may be made from it, some whole ginger, previous^ 
ly boiled till tender, being stewed along with it. 



PRESERVES. 149 

The covering or " papering up" of jelly and jam is 
best deferred till the day after they are made. By 
that time the jelly ought to give distinct indications of 
congealing. If it does not, the safest plan is to give it 
another " boil up." Two different covers of paper are 
requisite. The inner one is of thin clean writing paper 
a quarter of an inch larger than the mouth of the pot, 
and snipped to that depth all round the edge. This is 
steeped in a saucer of whiskey or other spirit, and laid 
close upon the surface of the jelly or jam, so that there 
is no air underneath it ; the nicked edges being turned 
up against the sides of the pot. A teaspoonful of spirits 
is then poured on the top of this, and an outer cover of 
stout paper stretched over the mouth, and firmly secured 
over the lip of the pot with a piece of twine passed two 
or three times round and tied. Each pot should have 
the name of its contents written on the outside cover. 
Thus prepared, jeUy and jam will, if they have been 
sufficiently boiled, keep for a long time in a dry cool 
place. During the first month, the pots should be 
opened once or twice, and if the inner 'papers have be- 
come mouldy, they should be removed and fresh ones 
substituted, with a little more spirits. If the mouldi> 
ness appears a second time, and seems inveterate, the 
contents of the pot can only be saved from spoiling by 
being boiled over again. 

Marmalade is a preserve similar to jam, made from 
the larger kinds of ripe fruit. The most general fa- 
vourite is the 

Scotch Orange-Marmalade, There are several ways 
of making this, of which the following is one : — Procure 
equal weights of ripe bitter or Seville oranges, and 
loaf-sugar. With a few of the pieces of sugar, grate 
off some of the outside of the rinds. Cut the oranges 
in quarters, and squeeze out the juice into a basin, 
through a sieve to keep back the seeds. With a teaspoon 
scrape out the soft pulp from the interior cavities of the 
oranges, rejecting the seeds. Detach from the rinds the 
remaining parts of the inside of the oranges, wash these 



150 PRESERVES. 

veil in a little water, and put this water and the soft 
pulp into the juice in the basin : what has been washed 
is now refuse. The rinds are then boiled under a close 
cover until so tender as to be easily pierced by a straw 
or pin*s-head, the water being once changed to remove 
some of the bitterness. The spongy white part is now 
scraped from the inside of the rind, and the remaining 
portion clipped with scissors into very thin chips or 
parings about half an inch long. Boil these along with 
the sugar, pulp, and juice, for fifteen or twenty minutes 
over a quick fire, skimming it when any scum rises. A 
little lemon-juice and grated peel is an improvement. 
This marmsJade is sometimes varied by pounding to a 
pulp part of the rinds, and having the rest in chips. 
This however very much impairs the transparency of 
the fluid portion. If the quantity of rinds seems too 
large, some of them may be withheld, or the fluid part 
may be eked out with apple jelly. Lemon MarmcUade 
is made in the same way, but with a half more sugar. 

Apricot and Melon Marmalades are made by re- 
moving the skins, stones, seeds, <&c., mincing the eat- 
able part, and boiling it with its weight of sugar. For 
Quince Malmalade the fruit should be first stewed and 
then mashed to a pulp. After being potted, marma- 
lade should stand for a day, and then be papered up as 
already directed for jelly and jam. 

Fruits Preserved Whole. — The fruits thus treated 
should be fresh, plump and ripe, and as perfect and free 
from injury as can be procured. They are preserved 
by simmering them for a short time in a clear syrup 
in the preserving pan, allowing them to steep,^ covered 
with this syrup, in an earthenware basin or tureen for 
a day or two, simmering them again, and so on alter- 
nately until the fruit has become thoroughly impreg- 
nated with sugar, which will require a time proportioned 
to the size of the fruit. The syrup should at^first be thin, 
and afterwards gradually increased in strength by the 
addition of more sugar at each boiling. If this is not 



PRBSBRVBS. 151 

attended to, the fruit, instead of being plump and trans- 
parent when done, will become shriyelled and unsightly. 
The entire quantity of sugar required is generally about 
a fourth more than the weight of fruit. — When the fruit 
has receired its final simmering, and become clear and 
transparent, it should be placed in earthenware or glass 
jars, the syrup poured boiling hot over it, and when 
oold, covered with wet bladder tied over the jar. In 
transferiing the fruit from one vessel to the other, it 
should be tifted out of the syrup as gently as possible 
with a silver spoon, so as not to injure it. If towards 
the end of the above process the syrup becomes tur- 
bid, it may be separated from the fruit, and clari- 
fied like soup by means of white of egg. This is 
mixed gradually with it while cold, and when coagu- 
lated by boiling, it seisses upon the impurities, and 
with them rises to the surface as a thick scum, which 
most then be skimmed off. A little cold water added 
after the first minute*s boiling facilitates the ascent of 
the scum. A red colour may be imparted where desired, 
or the colour of red fruits heightened, and the syrup 
tinged, by the addition of a little cochineal Port wine 
is abo used for the same purpose, with apples, pears, and 
quinces. Green fruits may have their colour improved 
by being previously laid in a vessel with green cabbage- 
leaves under and over them, and thus scalded with boil- 
ing water, closely covered, and allowed to cool. This pro- 
cess is repeated, using fresh leaves each time, till the 
desired edSect is produced. A very little pounded alum 
added to the water assists the operation. Tartness may 
be imparted to the more luscious fruits by means of 
lemon-juice. Spices also, such a« ginger and cloves, may 
be used where considered appropriate. Many kinds of 
of fruit thus preserved may be dried in the sun or a 
slow oven, and served at dessert in a candied state. 

Jargonelle Fears and Pippins must be pared, and if 
the seeds are picked out at the flower-end with a bodkin 
or toothpick, the preserved fruit will keep better. 

Plums, Apricots, and other stone-fruit, should have 



> 



152 PRESERVES. 

the stones removed by a small slit in the side, keeping 
the fi*uit as whole as possible. The tough-skinned fruits 
may also be peeled, which a previous scalding will facili- 
tate. The kernels may be blanched and simmered in 
the syrup to impart their flavour. A simple method of 
preserving such fruits is to prick them with a needle, 
drop them into a wide-mouthed bottle with some 
pouiided loaf-sugar, fill up the bottle with brandy, cork 
it, and then bake in a slow oven for some hours. The 
cork may then be sealed, to prevent access of air. 

Cucumbers and Melons are first steeped in salt and 
water for a couple of days, and then in fresh water for 
the same time. They are then " greened " by the pro* 
cess above described, after which the seeds and soft 
parts are scooped out by an incision in the side, and 
some ginger, cloves, and whole white pepper inserted. 
They are then treated with syrup in the usual manner. 
Large thin-skinned Bitter Oranges are preserved some- 
what in the same manner. After the steeping, the pulp 
is exti*acted at a hole made in the top, and the juice 
expressed from it, strained, and added to the syrup. 
This preserve may be ornamented by making a sort of 
cameo carving of leaves &c. upon the rinds before re- 
moving the pulp. Whett served, the hollow skins may 
be filled with custard, or various jellies, &c. 

Gooseberries, both red and green, should be chosen 
rather unripe. They should be " topped and tailed,** 
and each one pricked with a needle. Their appearance 
is improved by picking out the seeds. 

Stratuberries should first lie covered with dry sugar 
for a night. Their weight of sugar is then made into 
a thin syrup vrith red-currant juice, and in this they are 
simmered till the syrup will congeal when cold. They 
must be very gently handled to avoid breaking them. 

PICKLES. — These are used as relishes and gamish- 
ings for various dishes, and also as ingredient-s in many 
sauces. They consist of various kinds of esculent vege- 
tables preserved in spiced vinegar, this being wholly or 



PICKLES. 153 

partially substituted for their natural juices, which are 
first usually extracted bj means of salt. The vege- 
tables should be fresh and sound, and not too ripe. 
They should be gathered on a dry day, carefully trim- 
med and wiped, and only those washed which require 
steeping or salting. The vinegar and spices used should 
not be stinted, the only limit to the quantity of the 
latter being that they ought not to overpower the 
flavour of the vegetables. 

The general mode of making pickles is as follows : — 
The vegetables having been previously prepared in the 
way suited to their kind, are placed in a stone-ware 
jar, and the vinegar with the spice in it (whole black 
and white pepper, and ginger) is made boiling hot and 
poured over them. The jar is then covered with a 
thickly-folded cloth in order to keep in the steam. 
If the vegetables are large and solid, such as cucumbers, 
this process is repeated several times with the same 
vinegar till they become saturated with it. In such 
cases the spices need not be added till the last boiling, 
else some of their strength will be lost. With green 
vegetables, whose colour is impaired by their preliminary 
preparation, a number of cabbage or vine leaves may 
be mixed. These having partially restored the colour 
during the above process, are of course removed. When 
cold, the jar is fitted with a cork, which may be made 
air-tight by dipping it in melted bottle-wax or tying 
a piece of wetted bladder over it. If after the first 
two days the vegetables soak up much of the vinegar, 
more should be added, so as to keep them covered. A 
stoneware pipkin is the most suitable vessel for heating 
the vinegar in, because metal is corroded and dissolved 
by the acid. On this account, brass and copper ves- 
sels ought never to be used, their solutions in vinegar 
being highly poisonous ; notwithstanding which, how- 
ever, pickle-manufacturers are said to be sometimes 
rash enough to use such to heighten the colour of their 
green pickles. As boiling evaporates the strength of 
the vinegar, it ought merely to be heated to the boiling 



154 PICKLES, 

point and used immediately. If the vinegar is wanted 
yerj hotly spiced, a little cayenne may be used in it. 

Bed Cabbage, The outer blades being remoTed, cut 
the cabbage in half length-ways, wash it free from dirt, 
and then cut it across in slices as thin as possible, he- 
ginning at the top. Sprinkle the sliced cabbage thickly 
with salt, and let it remain thus for a day. The salt 
extracts the juice, which is then drained off through a 
collander. The cabbage, drained as dry as possible, is 
then treated with yinegar and spice as already directed, 
until it resumes its original plumpness, which may be 
after the first or second scalding. A few onions pre- 
pared as below, and sliced among the cabbage, make a 
Tory good mixture. 

Onions, Choose small siWer onions as equal in size 
as posssible Cut off the tops and tails, but not too 
close, and cover the onions with boiling brine in a 
basin. Next day repeat this scalding, peel them when 
cool, and throw each as it is done, into vinegar. They 
are then ready for the boiling vinegar and spice. As 
unpeeled onions are blackened by exposure to the air, 
this must be avoided as much as possible, by keeping 
them always covered with brine or vinegar as above 
directed. 

Beetroot. The tops being removed, it must be washed, 
but nowhere cut or injured, else the juice, which in 
this case is to be preserved for the sake of its colour, 
will be lost. It is then boiled in plenty of salted water 
till tender, which may be in about half an hour. The 
skin is now rubbed off with a coarse cloth, the beet- 
root sliced across, put into a jar, and the vinegar and 
spice poured over it. This pickle makes a pleasing 
garnish. A little salt added improves the taste, but 
slightly impairs its brilliant colour. 

{Cauliflower or BrocolL The centre or flower part 
only is used. Being well cleaned, it is immersed for 
about four minutes in boiling brine, and then drained. 
When tolerably dry, it is divided into conveniently- 
sized pieces, the stalks being cut smoothly, — packed in

the jars in which it is to be kept, and coTered with 
the boiling yinegar and spice. This vegetable may be 
very well mixed with any other white or green pickles. 
In making such mixtures, the various vegetables, if 
they are not all procurable in perfection at the same 
time, may^ each be prepared and added in their proper 
seasons. Nasturtiums, not over ripe, are pickled in the 
same way. 

Mushrooms, Pat small white button-mushrooms, 
wiped clean, into a stone jar along with the spices and 
a little salt. Set the jar over a slow fire, or in a pot 
of boiling water, and let the mushrooms stew in their 
own liquor till that is nearly all evaporated. Then add 
as much hot vinegar as will cover them, and let this 
just come to the boil. When cold, bottle them up, 
add a little more vinegar at the end of the first week 
if they require it, and then cork them. 

Cucumbers. The preparation of these is the same 
as for preserving (see p. 152), except that they are not 
steeped in fresh water, and that hot vinegar is used in 
the " greening" process (see p. 152) instead of water. 
When the desired tint is attained, the green leaves are 
^ removed, the vinegar heated for the last time (adding 
the spice, which in this case may include cloves and 
crushed nutmeg), and poured over the cucumbers. 

OherkinSf French Beans, and other green pickles, 
are prepared in the same manner. 

Cucumbers and Onions, as a mixed pickle, are pre- 
pared by skinning large onions, paring the cucumbers 
and removing their seeds, slicing both in thick slices, 
strewing them thickly with salt in a collander, allowing 
them to drain for a night, and then alternately heating 
and cooling them with vinegar in a covered stone jar 
until well saturated. Lastly, the same vinegar is heated 
tUl boiling, along with spices, and poured over them. 

Walnuts, Procure them unripe, and with tender 
shells. If they are wanted green, the greatest care 
must be taken during their preparation not to expose 
them for any length of time to the air, which blackens 



156 SALTING MEAT. 

them. Steep them for nine days in strong brine, chan- 
ging this twice during the time, and keeping them im- 
mersed in it by means of a board floating over them. 
Drain them, prick each in several places with a large 
needle, and then " green" them by the process described 
on p. 152, until the husks' become tender. These are 
then quickly scraped off with a knife, and each walnut 
rubbed smooth with flannel and immediately thrown 
into hot water. The vinegar and spices, including 
cloves and cayenne, to which some salt is added, are 
then prepared ; and when these are boiling hot, the 
walnuts must be quickly removed from the water, dried 
with a cloth, placed in the jars in which they are to be 
kept, and covered with the boiling vinegar. — Walnuts 
are pickled hlax^k more easUy. They are first pricked 
with a needle, then steeped for twelve days in the 
brine (which should be poured on them boiling hot 
and changed every three days), and lastly, after being 
drained and rubbed smooth and dry, they are covered 
as above with the boiling vinegar seasoned with horse- 
radish, garlic, mustard seed, and pepper.

CHAPTER XIV. 

MISCEIiIiANEA. 

SALTING MEAT.— The preceding chapter treats of 
Pickles J properly so called. Pickled Meat, however, is 
prepared by a very different process, in which brine is 
the antiseptic employed. This brine may be ma^e as 
follows : — Six pounds of salt, one of brown sugar, and 
four ounces of saltpetre, boiled in four gallons of water, 
skimmed, and allowed to cool. The meat is kept en- 
tirely covered with thi& in a tub or wooden trough. 
When the brine becomes turbid and covered with scum 
it must either be renewed, or re-boiled and skimmed. 



SALTING MEAT. 157 

This is the mode adopted for saltiDg large quantities 
of meat, to be kept in store for a long time. A single 
piece of meat for immediate use is generally salted by 
rubbing it in every part with a dry mixture of common 
salt, sugar, and saltpetre, in the proportion of half an 
ounce of each of the last to a pound of the first. It 
is then placed in a deep glazed earthenware pan or dish, 
and strewed with the mixture, which in a day's time 
' extracts a considerable quantity of the juice of the meat, 
forming with this a strong brine, with which the meat 
must be daily basted and rubbed till required, turning 
it over in the pan each time, so that every part may be 
equally salted. A Round of Beef thus treated will be 
ready for use in four or five days, its saltness depend- 
ing upon the time. The salt in this case preserves the 
meat partly by extracting its moisture, which is an 
active agent in the decomposition of animal substances. 
The loss of juice which meat sustains while being ^Ited 
is even greater than in boiling, and hence arises the 
unwholesomeness of salted meat as a constant article of 
diet. The use of an impure salt containing chlorides 
of calcium and magnesium, although less palatable, is 
said partially to prevent this, by transforming an im- 
portant soluble constituent of the juice, called phosphate 
of soda, into the phosphates of lime and magnesium, 
which being insoluble remain in the meat. When such 
meat is eaten along with vegetables, the soda which 
these contain is supposed during digestion to decom- 
pose the insoluble phosphates and reproduce the origi- 
nal phosphate of soda. The saltpetre gives the meat a 
bright red colour. Pepper and other spices are some- 
times mixed with the salt. 

The antiseptic property of smoke as used in curing 
hams (fee, depends upon the vapour of creosote it con- 
tains. The addition of this liquid, in the proportion of 
one part in a hundred, to the brine in which hams or 
tongues are pickled, produces all the effects of smoking. 
Previous to salting, meat should have been kept till 
readf for cooking, and the kernels ought to be cut out. 



158 SALTING MEAT. 

The principal of these lie in the udder and centre fat 
of a round of beef, and in the thick end of the flank. 

Pork requires rather longer salting than beef. 

Collared Beef consists of the end of the brisket, or 
the flank, salted as above. When it has lain in salt for 
a week or ten days, take out the bones, remove the 
inside skin, strew the meat thickly with a mixture of 
grated nutmeg, black pepper, allspice, chopped lemon- 
thyme and parsley, roll it up tightly, and sew it up in a 
strong cloth bandage. It is now ready for boiling (see 
p. 42.) It may also be baked in a large jar of water. 
The cloth shoidd not be removed till it is quite cold. 

Sawages. Of these there are many kinds. They 
consist of a highly-seasoned mixture of flnely-mihced 
lean and fat of meat, to which bread-crumbs, yolk of 
egg, and shred sweet herbs are sometimes added. Both 
fresh and salted meat are used, and variety is obtained 
by mixing different kinds of meat together. The mix- 
ture is either stuffed into clean gut-skins by means of 
an instrument for the purpose, and twisted in links, or 
moulded into rolls or flat cakes, in which form it is only 
adapted for frying or baking in a pie. For this last 
purpose exhausted meat from soup ^c, or the cold re^ 
mains of roast or boiled meat, may be very well intro- 
duced. Some kinds of sausages are smoked, by which 
means they are made capable of being kept for a con- 
siderable time. 

Potted Head, Although called potted head, this may 
be made from almost any gelatinous part of veal, or 
from cow heels or head. The meat is first simmered till 
tender, cut into very small pieces (not minced), rejecting 
the hard gristles, and then highly seasoned, and boiled 
for some time with the same liquor strained. It is then 
poured into earthenware moulds, from which when cold 
and very firm it is turned out and served garnished 
with parsley or pickled beetroot. Minced lemon-peel 
and juice may be added to the seasonings of potted veal. 
Mustard and vinegar are favourite condiments for this 



POTTBD MEAT. 159 

dish ; to which also a simple Tegetable salad makes an 
excellent accompaniment. 

Fatted Meat consists of the flesh of- beef (either fresh 
or slightly salted), game, or poultry, cut in pieces, high- 
ly seasoned, packed closely in an earthen jar, in which 
it is then slowly stewed with Tery little water, either in 
a moderate oven or a pot of boiling water. When Tery 
tender, a smaller jar is placed upon it with a heary 
weight resting upon this, and it is thus pressed till cold, 
and converted into a solid compact mass. It is then 
covered with a layer of clarified butter, and a piece of 
soaked bladder tied over the jar. The meat being thus 
protected from the air, will keep good for several months. 
It is eaten cold for breakfast, or made into sandwiches 
for lunch or supper. Meat already cooked, or which 
has been used in making soup or gravy, may be potted 
by pounding it in a mortar to a smooth paste along 
with a little butter and seasonings, which may in- 
clude dried and powdered sweet herbs, drc. It should 
be cooked in small jars as above, and covered with but- 
ter and bladder. Sprats, herrings, and shrimps, may 
also be potted in the same way,— of course rejecting the 
bones and shells. 

SALADS. — Salad consists of uncooked fresh young 
vegetables and herbs of various kinds, with a creamy, 
pungent, acid sauce. Lettuce is generally the chief 
ingredient employed, — ^radishes, onions, cucumber, mus- 
tard-cress, &c., being frequently added in due propor- 
tions as flavourers. All the vegetables should be pro- 
cured as fresh and crisp as possible, and are generally, 
but especially the lettuce, the better of lying for an 
hour or two in cold spring water before using. They 
must then be carefully washed from grit and insects, 
freed from all decayed or worm-eaten leaves, sliced 
rather small, and after being gently dried by shaking 
them lightly in a clean towel, placed in a deepish salad- 
basin. There are many ways of making the sauce, 
vinegar and Florence oil being generally the chief con> 
stituents, with hard-boiled yolks of eggs and cream to 



160 SALADS. 

impart richness, and a seasoning of pepper and salt and 
freshly-made mustard. The yolks of eggs, which should 
be perfectly cold, are first bruised down along with the 
cream ; the other ingredients are then added, and the 
whole well mixed, poured over the salad, and stirred up 
with it immediately before serving. The hard whites 
of the eggs may be cut across so as to form rings, and 
laid on the top as a garnish. Raw eggs (whites and 
yolks beaten together) may be substituted for the hard 
yolks, cream, and oil. Another very simple salad-sauce, 
adapted for lettuce alone, is composed merely of sugar 
and vinegar. Salads are excellent accompaniments to 
cold meat in suminer, being wholesome and cooling. 

French Salads are made by slicing down cold meat 
with the vegetables. The cold remains of any kind of 
meat or poultry may thus be economically employed. 
In the sauce for such salads, more salt is required than 
for vegetables alone, and the other seasonings may be 
varied to suit the kind of meat ; — the boiled egg-yolks 
and cream may be omitted. 

Lobster Salad is made by mixing the meat of a cold 
boiled lobster cut in pieces, with the salad vegetables ; 
pieces of the coral being used as garnish, and the spawn 
pounded with a little butter or oil to enrich the sauce. 

A refreshing variety of salad to be eaten along with 
cold meat, is made with cucumber and onions. A 
middling-sized cucumber, not fully ripe, is pared and 
then sliced across as thin as possible. This may be done 
rapidly by holding a thin table-knife firmly on a large 
plate, so that the blade lies fiat upon the bottom with- 
out quite touching it except at the point, and then 
rapidly rubbing the cucumber across the knife, so that 
at each stroke a shaving is cut as thick as the space 
between the blade and the bottom of the plate. One 
or two large onions are sliced among the cucumber, 
and the whole thickly strewn with salt. This in a short 
time will extract a great part of the juice, which must 
be poured ofi*. The slices are then well peppered and 
about half covered with vinegar. A little oil may be 



BBVBRAGB8. 161 

added. This preparation, from its pungency and acidity, 
is perhaps more allied to pickles than salads, and con- 
sequently cannot be partaken of so largely. 

Fruit Salad for Dessert. In a glass or other orna* 
mental dish spread some ripe luscious fruit (say straw- 
berries) and pounded loaf sugar in alternate layers, so 
as to form a pyramid, and over this squeeze the juice 
of a lemon until the sugar is saturated. Very ripe 
sweet oranges, peeled and cut across in slices, may be 
dressed in the same way. 

BEVERAGES.— The most important of those which 
come within the province of the cook are certainly Tea 
and Coffee^ and for the making of these a greater variety 
of methods has been suggested than for perhaps any 
other similar process. The chief object in making either 
is perfectly to extract the whole of their soluble matter 
without the loss of the more volatile portion, upon which 
their fine flavour and also part of their stimulating pro- 
perties depend. To effect this it is essential that the 
process should be performed as quickly as is consistent 
with its being done completely. 

In the case of Tta^ this end is best attained when 
the following conditions are attended to : \sty To have 
the water hoilvng ; 2d, To have the teapot hot and dr^ 
when the tea is put in ; 3d, To allow the tea to stand 
for a few minutes in the pot in front of the fire or in 
the oven in order that it also may be thoroughly warmed 
and dried, before pouring the boiling water over it; 
4<A, To keep the teapot hot in front of the fire; or by 
covering it with a thick flannel cover, during the process 
of infusion. It has been recommended for the same 
purpose to infuse the tea in a tin " infuser " which 
hooks on to the front of the grate, but there is some 
danger that in this way the tea would be boiled, in which 
case its volatile " aroma" would be instantly dissipated. 
If the above conditions are observed, the heat of the 
water poured upon the tea is not wasted in heating the 
cold teapot ; and from the tea being first perfectly dried, 

M 



162 BEVERAGES. 

the hot water instantly rushes by capillary attraction 
into its minutest cells, and the process of extraction 
commences at the first instant of contact. When tea 
is made for a number of people, it is best to use two 
teapots; fresh tea being prepared in one while the 
other is in use. If only one teapot is used, it is better 
not to infuse the whole quantity of tea at once, filling 
up the pot with hot water as the first infusion is poured 
out, but rather to reserve some of it to be added from 
time to time along with the water. By this means the 
first and last cups may be served out equally good, in- 
stead of all the finer flavour being confined to the former, 
and the coarse, dark-coloured, bitter vegetable extract 
dispensed in the latter. The usual quantity of tea em- 
ployed is a little more than one heaped tea-spoonful for 
every two cups required. 

In making Coffee the same precautions should be 
observed. M. Soyer recommends stirring the dry cof- 
fee in a stewpan over the fire till quite hot. Boiling 
water being then added in the proportion of a quart to 
every two ounces of coffee, it is kept closely covered 
beside the fire for five minutes, strained through a 
cloth, re-warmed, and served in the coffee-pot. The 
French add an equal quantity of boiling milk before 
re-warming. There are many other modes of making 
coffee, and various contrivances for filtering it, but 
whichever is adopted, the utensils employed and the 
coffee powder ought to be heated. Where coffee is 
made every day, it is an economical plan to pour upon 
the used coffee-grounds some fresh boiling water, which 
being strained and boiled next day is then used instead 
of water, so that less coffee will serve. Coffee may be 
cleared in the coffee-pot without straining or filtering, 
simply by pouring out a cupful and returning it two 
or three times, and then setting the pot in front of the 
fire till the grounds fall to the bottom. This process, 
however, takes more time. A very little cold water 
poured in is said to assist it. The coffee used ought 
to be newly roasted and ground. To ensure this, many 



BEVERAGES. 163 

people buy the roasted beans and grind a sufficient 
quantitj for immediate use every morning in a small 
hand-mill. This also protects them from having their 
coffee adulterated with chicory ; a piece of dishonesty 
which is said to have lately so generally prevailed among 
retailers in this country, as actually to have vitiated the 
public taste to such an- extent that most people now 
prefer the mixture to the pure coffee. 

Chocolate, Mix two ounces of the scraped cake with 
a gill of water in a saucepan, and stir it rapidly over 
the fire until rather thick ; then mix with it gradually 
half a pint of boiling milk, and serve it hot, with sugar 
separate. The Italian method requires a chocolate-pot 
furnished with a muller, the handle of which passess 
through a hole in the lid. In this the scraped cho- 
colate is milled or churned with the milk over the fire 
until very hot and frothy. 

Cocoa. Over a tea-spoonful and a-half of cocoa in a 
cup, pour gradually some boiling milk, stirring the 
cocoa till dissolved. Or it may be first mixed with a 
little water, and then heated with milk in a saucepan 
till it begins to boil. Serve hot with sugar separate. 

Cooling Summer Drinks. — Raspberry Vinegar, Over 
a quart of freshly-gathered raspberries bruised in an 
earthenware basin, pour a pint of vinegar. Cover it 
closely for three days, stirring it once daily, and then 
strain it through a jelly-bag. To each pint of the 
clear liquor add a pound of loaf-sugar, and boil it for 
ten minutes, removing the scum as it rises. When 
cold, bottle, and cork it tightly. A wine-glassful in a 
tumbler of cold water makes a refreshing drink. ' It 
may also be used with hot water, in which case a little 
sngar may be added. 

Lemonade. Rub off the yellow rind of one lemon 
with a piece of loaf-sugar, and place this along with the 
juice and pulp of three lemons in a deep jug. Pour over 
it a quart of boiling water, and add loaf-sugar to taste. 
When cold, strain it, and it is fit for use. A similar 



164 COOLINO DRINKS. 

drink may be made bj substituting two ounces of cream 
of tartar for the lemon juice. This may also be fla- 
voured with lemon-peel as above. 

Ginger-Beer. In two gallons of water boil for half 
an hour, two ounces of bruised ginger and two pounds 
of loaf-sugar, removing the scum as it rises. Slice one 
or two lemons into a tub, along with half-an-ounce of 
cream of tartar, and pour the hot liquor over these. 
When nearly cold, add a quarter of a pint of yeast, 
with which let it ferment for four days, or less if the 
weather is warm, closely covered up with a board and 
blankets. Then draw it off from the lees or sediment 
with a syphon or otherwise, and bottle it in a few days 
after. A little brandy may be added if it is to be kept 
long. The corks should be secured by wires. — A com- 
moner kind may be made with brown sugar, using rather 
less of it, and omitting the lemons. A kind of extem- 
pore ginger beer may be made as follows : — Rub to- 
gether in a mortar half a pound of pounded loaf-«6Ugar, 
two ounces of carbonate of soda, and half an ounce of 
ground ginger. Dissolve a teaspoonful of this mixture 
in a tumbler of water, stir in quickly half a teaspoon- 
ful of powdered tartaric or citric acid, and drink it 
while effervescing. The acid may be mixed with the 
other ingredients in the proportion of an ounce and a 
quarter to the above quantity. They must however be 
previously thoroughly dried, and the mixture kept in a 
stoppered bottle, as the least moistUre will in a short 
time deprive it of its property of effervescing. By 
omitting the ginger, and using a little more citric acid, 
the above mixture will form an agreeable effervescing 
Lemonade, 

Sprtice Beer is made and fermented like the above, 
substituting six ounces of essence of spruce for the 
ginger, and omitting the lemons and cream of tartar. 
Brown Spruce Beer is made with treacle instead of sugar. 

Treacle Beer is made by boiling for twenty minutes 
in three gallons of water a pound and a half of treacle, 
and half an ounce of hops, to which a little ginger may 




HOME-MADB WINES. 165 

be added tied in a piece of rag. This decoction is then 
fermented as directed for ginger beer (see p. 164.) 

HOME-MADE WINES.— These are mostly made 
from the ripe native fruits of this country. The gene- 
ral plan for all is the same as that indicated in the re- 
ceipt given on p. 167. The process by which they are 
produced is c&Wed fermentation. It is a curious chemi- 
cal transformation of the sugar contained naturally in 
the juice, or added to it, into alcohol and carbonic acid. 
This change is the first step towards decay which all 
vegetable and animal liquids containing sugar under; 
go. It will not take place below a certain temperature 
(somewhere about 35^, the most favourable being from 
40o to 86®), nor unless some vegetable or animal matter 
which is just beginning to decay be present ; and hence 
exposure to the air, as promoting this decay, is also ne- 
cessary. Once begun, however, the process goes on, 
slowly even if the air be excluded, until nearly all the 
sugar has disappeared. As this is not always desirable, 
however, the process is generally checked so that the 
wine may be more or less sweet or strong. For this 
purpose, exposing it to cold in a cellar, keeping the air 
excluded, racking it (that is, removing it from the sedi- 
ment and scum, which both contain some of the ferment 
or decaying vegetable matter), and putting it into a clean 
cask impregnated with sulphurous acid by burning brim- 
stone matches in it, are the different methods generally 
employed, either singly or in combination. It is by 
different modifications of these modes of checking or 
promoting the fermentation, and regulating the pro- 
portion of sugar employed, that various kinds of wine 
may be made from the same fruit. 

Thus for a strong dry wine, the change should be 
rendered as complete as possible, by continuing the 
process in an open vat or tub for at least three or four 
days, and then putting it into a cask sufficiently large 
to prevent the scum overflowing at the bunghole, as this 
scum favours the continuance of the process which pro- 



166 GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 

duces it. It may also be frequently stirred, or the cask 
shaken, which also promotes the fermentation. Nearly 
the whole of the sugar will in this way be changed, 
and a strong but not very sweet wine be the result. 

To produce a rich sweet wine, besides adding a larger 
proportion of sugar to the fruit juice, the fermentation 
must be stopped before it has gone so far as in the pre- 
ceding case, by allowing it to remain a much shorter 
time in the open tub, and when removed into the cask, 
keeping this always filled and stopped so as to exclude 
the air. For the same purpose, brimstone matches are 
sometimes previously burnt inside the cask, the sul- 
phurous acid thereby produced having the effect of 
checking the fermentation. It is also once or twice 
" racked," and put into a clean cask. This " racking" 
is done through a small hole bored for the purpose near 
the lower side of the cask. 

Effervescing wine is exposed to the air for a still 
shorter time while fermenting, but less sugar is used. 
When in the cask, it is kept in a cool place, carefully 
protected from the air as above, and the bung is closely 
fastened up as soon as the fermentation becomes so 
languid that this can be done without danger of burst- 
ing the cask. Unripe fruits are best adapted for this 
kind of wine. 

Wine may remain in the cask from six weeks to two 
months, or longer, according to the weather, by which 
time it will become clear and may be bottled, which 
should be done in dry cold weather.. 

After the fermentation has subsided and the wine 
become clear, the air should be excluded from it as 
much as possible, else it will undergo another change, 
and become converted into vinegar. The fermentation 
of wines, especially the thick sweet sort, is more easily 
effected if a large quantity be made. It is hardly pos- 
sible to succeed perfectly with less than two gallons at 
one time. All the utensils employed, especially the 
casks and tubs, should be scrupulously clean, el^e they 
will communicate a bad flavour to the wine. The fol- 



HOME-MADE WINES. 167 

lowing receipt may be taken as an example of wine- 
making — subject, of course, to the preceding remarks : — 
Red-Currant Wine, Bruise the fruit in a tub with 
the Band, mix it with an equal measure of water, and 
allow it to stand thus for a night. It is then strained 
through a sieve or canvas bag, squeezing the husks as 
dry as possible To each gallon of liquid add about 
three pounds of sugar, stir it occasionally till dissolved, 
and let it stand in a tub or vat covered with a board 
and blankets in a moderately warm room for two or 
three days, when it will be covered with a frothy scum. 
This scum is removed with a perforated skimmer, and 
the wine, now tolerably clear, drawn off from the 
sediment by a hole bored in the side of the vat near 
the bottom, into a clean cask, which should be quite 
fiUed with it. If the wine is drawn off by means of a 
syphon instead of tapping the vat, it need not be 
skimmed, as the short end of the syphon being im- 
mersed beneath the scum nearly to the top of the 
sediment, will draw off the liquid free from both these 
impurities. The cask must now be kept in a cool 
place, with the bung-hole open, or closed merely with 
a tile laid over it, till the fermentation ceases, keeping 
it always fiUed to the bung by adding occasionally, as 
its contents diminish, some of the liquor reserved for 
that purpose. In a month or six weeks the fermen- 
tation will have subsided, when the wine, being now 
clear, will be ready for use, and may be bottled. It is 
generally safer, however, to " rack*' it into a fresh 
" sulphured" cask, which must be kept tightly bunged 
till the ensuing spring, when it may be bottled with- 
out fear of the fermentation recommencing. If it is 
then not perfectly clear, it may be " fined" with isin- 
glass or white of Qgg, — these being dissolved in a small 
quantity of the wine, and this thoroughly mixed with 
the whole, which after standing undisturbed for ten 
days, may be racked off or bottled quite clear. One 
egg or an equal quantity of a solution of isinglass of 
the same consistence is enough for five gallons. Spirit 



168 HOME-MADE WINES. 

(bntndj or whisky) are generally added, in a propor- 
tion mrjing from a pint upwards, for eyerj nine 
gallons. It is put into the cask shortly before the 
fermentation ceases. It assists in stopping the fermen- 
tation, but will not, as is erroneously believed, prevent 
the wine becoming sour if exposed to the air, as it is 
from the spirit that the acetic acid of sour wine is 
formed. Spirits are therefore by no means indispens- 
able ; the wine if properly made will become quite strong 
enough with the alcohol generated during its fermen- 
tation. Wine is frequently flavoured with spices, such 
as cloves, cinnamon, <kc., which are for this purpose 
wrapped iu a piece of rag and suspended in the wine 
from the bung-hole during the last stage of fermen- 
tation, and withdrawn as soon as the desired degree of 
flavour has been imparted. In wines made from stone- 
fruit, the kernels may be used in the same way. Cream 
of tartar, or crude tartar, is sometimes employed to 
promote the fermentation. Red-coloured wines generally 
require a longer time to ferment than white wines. 

For Elderberry, Parsnip, Ginger, Birch (made from 
the sap of the birch-tree with raisins), and some other 
wines, the liquor is extracted by boiling ; and as this 
stops for a long time its natural tendency to ferment, 
a little yeast may be employed to begin the process. 
The usual method is to spread the yeast on a piece of 
toasted bread, and put it into the liquor. 

Mulled Wine consists of wine heated with spices, as 
cinnamon, grated nutmeg, cloves, &c. When it reaches 
the boiling point, the spices are removed, and. the wine 
served hot along with toast or rusks. Elderberry wine 
treated thus is a favourite winter-evening drink. 

Posset consists of hot wine added to custard (see 
page 107), the iJ^hole being well mixed by pouring it 
alternately from one vessel to another. It is generally 
made with canary or sack wine, and called Sack Posset 

Het (hot) Pint. This Scotch " Hogmanay " beverage 
consists of hot ale, beaten eggs, and whisky, seasoned

with Bugar and grated nutmeg. The sugar and eggs 
are mixed with a little cold ale^ the hot ale is then 
poured over this, and the whole mixed as in making 
custard. It is again heated till nearly boiling, when 
the whisky and nutmeg are added. 

DjiiNKs AND Diet fob Inyalids. — Toast and Water, 
Toast a crusty slice of bread slowly till quite hard and 
dry, and of a deep chocolate colour, but by no means 
burnt. Place it in a deep jug, pour over it two pints of 
boiling water, and cover it up till cold. Then strain 
it clear from the toast, which if left in it would in a 
short time induce fermentation. 

Barley Water, In half a gallon of water, boil till 
tender two ounces of pearl-barley, along with a season- 
ing of lemon-peel and cinnamon, and a little sugar. 
Skim, and strain it through a hair-sieve, and when cold 
it is ready for use. A little lemon or orange-juice may 
be added. Rice Water is made in the same way. 

Apple Water is made by pouring boiling water over 
sliced apples in a jug, which must be covered up till 
cold. It is then strained and sweetened to taste with 
honey or sugar. Or, the sliced apples may be boiled, 
taking care that they do not dissolve. When prepared 
in this way, a few figs cut in half may be added : they 
not only sweeten the drink, but impart a fruity rich- 
ness to it. A similar beverage may be made by boiling 
Prunes, The boiled fruit sweetened with sugar is very 
good to eat. 

Add drink from Ripe Fruit is made simply by drain- 
ing the juice from any kind of juicy fruit, such as 
strawberries, rasps, currants, &c., and mixing it to taste 
with water and sugar, to which lemon -juice may be 
added if additional tartness is required. 

Wine Whey is made by mixing with hot milk as 
much sherry or other wine as will curdle it, and pour- 
ing off the whey when the curd sinks, which it does 
after standing a few minutes. Sweeten it to taste, and 
dilute it with hot water to the strength required. 



170 DIET FOR INVALIDS. 

Treacle Whey (excellent for promoting perspiration) is 
made in the same manner, but requires no sweetening 
or hot water. 

Grtul. Mix a teacupful of fine oatmeal with a small 
quantity of cold water in a basin. Pour this water off 
into another basin, and repeat the process until about 
a quart has been used, and all the finer part of the 
meal has been extracted. Strain this into a saucepan, 
and boil it for twenty minutes, stirring it continually. 
It may then be seasoned according to taste, either with 
salt or sugar, a little lemon-juice or other acid being 
added with the sugar if desired. 

Caudle consists of sweet gruely flavoured with wine, 
lemon-juice, and nutmeg or other spice. It may also be 
made by boiling ground rice or wheat flour with small 
beer or milk. 

Bice Milk, In a pint of milk simmer till tender, or 
reduced to a pulp if desired, a tablespoonful of well- 
washed rice ; season with sugar and a very little salt. 
A little butter, and some mild spice, may also be stirred 
into it if approved. 

Sago Milk After the sago has been soaked in water 
for an hour, proceed exactly as for rice milk. Sago Gruel 
is made in the same way, but with water instead of 
milk. A little wine may be added. 

Vermicelli, Semolina, and Tapioca Milks, are pre- 
pared by throwing a tablespoonful or less of either into 
a pint of boiling milk, and simmering till sufficiently 
tender. The seasonings are the same as for rice milk. 

Macaroni and Milk. Throw the macaroni into plenty 
of boiling water salted, and boil it till tender. Then 
pour off the water and add some milk ; bring this to 
the boil, and season with sugar and a pinch of salt. 

Arrowroot. Mix about two teaspoonfuls of arrow- 
root with a little cold water, and pour over this a pint 
of boiling milk. Boil it over the fire for a few minutes, 
stirring constantly ; season with sugar and a pinch of 
salt. It may be made with water, in which case a little 
wine and lemon-juice and butter may be added if de- 



DIBT FOR INVALIDS. 171 

sired. This may also be made into a jelly by allowing 
it to cool in a mould and turning it out (see p. 144). 

Panada or Breadherry, Crumble a stale penny roll 
into a small saucepan^ just cover it with water, and 
stir it over the fire while it boils for five minutes. 
Season with sugar and a very little salt, and thin it as 
required with milk or water. The beaten yolk of an 
®e^ and a small piece of butter may be used in it, and 
a little spirits or wine, and nutmeg, are also sometimes 
employed. Panada may be made with weak broth or 
small beer instead of water ; in the former case the 
sugar is of course omitted. 

Stewed Prunes, The very small and damaged ones 
being rejected, the prunes are stewed for half an hour 
with a little water in a jar placed in boiling water. 
They may be sweetened with sugar ; cinnamon, lemon- . 
peel, and a little wine, are also sometimes added. 

Beef Tea, See page ^'2y — or instead of mincing the 
meat it may be cut into very thin small slices, and 
slowly heated in water till boiling. All fat and scum 
should be skimmed off; rice may be boiled in it. 

Mutton, Veal, and Chicken Broths should be made 
strictly according to the General Directions for Soups 
on page ^2. The fat should be carefully skimmed off, 
and the seasoning not too strong. Rice may be used 
in them, and if permitted, a little onion and parsley; 
but all these ought to be thoroughly cooked. The 
chicken broth may be made as a stew-soup (see p. 92). 

DiBT FOR THE NuRSERY. In this mav be included the 
broths and farinaceous preparations with milk, already 
described as diet for invalids ; to which we may add 
the following more substantial articles : — 

Bread and Milk, Cut two or three ounces of stale 
bread into small dice, and pour over this in a basin a 
quantity of boiling milk sufiicient to cover it ; cover 
the basin till sufiiciently cool, and sweeten with sugar. 

Oatmeal Porridge, . Into some water boiUng in a 
saucepan throw a little salt, and then pour gradually 



172 DIBT FOR THE NURSERY. 

into it from the hand a sufficient quantity of coarse 
oatmeal to make it of the desired thickness^ rapidly 
stirring it all the time with a porridge-stick or thevil, 
to prevent its burning or forming knots. When boiled 
enough, it is poured into a plate or saucer and allowed 
to cool a little. It is eaten with either new milk or 
buttermilk, which are the best for children. Treacle, 
sugar, cream or butter, are also sometimes taken with 
it instead of milk. With porter^ or beer and sugar, it 
is a favourite supper with many adults. Porridge may 
be made with milk or a mixture of milk and water, in 
which case less oatmeal will be required. If boiled till 
very smooth, it is said to be more wholesome than when 
less boiled. The roughness of this latter, which is pre- 
ferred by some people, may be partially communicated 
to the former by rapidly stirring in a handful of raw 
meal immediately on removing it from the fire: 

Barley-meal Porridge. The requisite quantity of 
meal should be mixed smoothly with cold water first, 
and then boiled, throwing in the necessary quantity of 
salt. It is eaten with the same accompaniment as oat- 
meal porridge. It may also be made with milk instead 
of water. A similar preparation of wheat flour and 
milk is called HaMy Pudding, 

Pease-meal Brose is made by pouring boiling water 
sufficiently salted upon '^Glasgow Brose-meaV* in a basin, 
and stirring it rapidly so as to form a thick smooth 
paste. It is eaten with milk or buttermilk. This, from 
its cheapness, is a good deal used by many of the poor 
in Scotland. Oatmeal Brose is made in the same way, 
but should not be stirred, being allowed to stand a few 
minutes, and then merely cut across several times with 
a spoon 80 as to form knots. In Kail Brose the liquor 
in which salt-beef and greens have been boiled is used 
instead of water, — the fatter the better. These, how- 
ever, from the rawness of the oatmeal, are hardly pro- 
per for children. 

Pap for Infants may be made with thin slices of stale 
bread toasted till quite dry and pale brown, — but rusks 



DIBT FOR THE NURSERY. 173 

are better. Break these in small pieces into a small 
saucepan, just cover them with water, and make them 
hot without boiling. Pour off most of the water, add 
a little brown sugar, and then mash the whole to a pulp. 
French Pap is a kind of very thin hasty pudding (see 
Barleymeal Porridge, p. 172) sweetened with sugar. The 
flour for this, however, is better prepared as follows : — 
Press it closely into a gallipot, cover the mouth of this 
with a stiff flour-and- water paste, over which tie firmly 
a piece of linen rag, and thus boil it for three or four 
hours. Having been already cooked in this way, the 
flour only requires to be heated with milk and water. 
This forms a much better food for young infants than 
that in which the milk has been boiled and thus ren- 
dered less digestible. 

Meaty <£rc. It is of the greatest importance to child- 
ren that their meat should be wholesomely cooked. For 
this purpose the " General Directions " given in the 
chapters treating of the different processes, ought to be 
faithfully followed. With the exception of salt, much 
less seasoning is required than for the food of adults, — 
mustard, pepper, and such-like stimulants being not 
only unnecessary, but generally distasteful. With the 
meat they ought to have the usual vegetable acccompani- 
ments, but with a larger proportion of the farinaceous 
kinds, such as rice, macaroni, <fec. Children ought not 
to commence a solid meat diet under three years of age, 
and then the meat ought to bear a very small propor- 
tion to the rest of their food, gradually increasing as 
they grow older. Simple broth with rice in it they 
may get much earlier. As variety of food is good for 
them as well as for grown people, they should oc- 
casionally have light farinaceous puddings, and a small 
proportion of ripe fruit in its season. If cooked, fruit 
is much better for them stewed, and eaten with rice, 
than in the form of pastry, which often, as many know 
to their cost, disagrees with them from its comparative 
indigestibility. A favourite and wholesome dish of fruit 
for children is called — 



174 REMARKS ON DINNERS. 

OooBeherry-fooL This consists of unripe green goose- 
berries, stewed with very little water till quite soft but 
not burst, in an earthen jar placed in a pot of boiling 
water, — then drained and mashed to a pulp. This when 
cold is sweetened with brown sugar, and served with a 
little milk mixed with it in a hash-dish. 

Rhubarb or Apples may be prepared in the same way. 



REMARKS ON DINNERS, &c. 

Dinners. — The provision for each day's dinner, so as 
to combine economy with variety, is not the least im- 
portant part of a housewife's duties. In a small family 
where no very extensive cooking is required, it is often 
a matter of some little difficulty to practise this com- 
bination. For roasting and boiling it is most economi- 
cal to purchase the best pieces of meat : though perhaps 
a little higher priced, they will go further, and other- 
wise give more satisfaction. Such pieces are of course 
much too large to be consumed in one day by three or 
four persons, and therefore variety upon succeeding 
days must be sought in a different mode of cooking the 
remainder. Thus part of the remains of one day's 
roast may be prepared as English stew for the second 
day ; more of it as a hash or ragout for the third ; and 
for the fourth a French salad may be made if sufficient 
be left ; or if not, the bones may be grilled as a devil 
for supper ; after which these bones will still be useful 
for soup. In the same way a piece of boiled meat may 
also be all used up without waste, the liquor being on 
the second day made into a clear soup, which may after- 
wards be rewarmed with additional vegetables as a pur6e 
soup. Pease soup will keep for a week, and be improved 
by it. In summer, cold meat occasionally, either plain 
with pickles, or dressed as a salad, will be found more 
agreeable than hot meat every day. The cheaper parts 
of meat, though inferior for roasting or boiling, furnish 



li.

excellent stews. A maigre dinner once or twice a-week, 
consisting either of fish, or of soup and some kind of 
pudding, is both economical and healthful. The fre- 
quencyof such, however, must be regulated by the habit» 
of the diners, — those engaged in sedentary in-door occu- 
pations being generally understood to require a larger 
proportion of animal food than others. 

The arrangement of dishes upon the table is a matter 
of taste and convenience. The principal ones should be 
placed at the head and foot, to be dispensed by the 
master and mistress of the house ; and the others, con- 
sisting of vegetables <fec., arranged on the table sym- 
metrically. The heavy work of carving ought certainly 
to be allotted to the master, although this is not always 
the custom. Before serving the dinner, the housewife 
should see that the table is furnished with its proper 
complement of knives and forks, napkins, glasses, bread, 
water, condiments, <fec., as calling for these things after- 
wards unpleasantly interrupts the order of dinner. 

The number of courses will depend in some measure 
upon the number dining and the *' style " maintained 
in the bouse. The usual order of serving is — \8t, Fish 
and Soup, which are " removed " by the larger roasts 
and boiled meats (hence called *' Removes*') and their 
.appropriate vegetables ; filling up the table, if the com- 
pany be large, with side dishes of smaller roasts of 
poultry ike, and a few made dishes ; — 2(/, Puddings and 
sweet fancy dishes of various kinds, jellies, tarts, and 
pies. At this stage also small game birds are intro- 
duced. Lastly comes the Dessert, consisting of ripe, 
preserved, and dried fruits, cake, &c. Before removing 
the cloth for dessert, cheese, with bread and biscuit, 
may be served along with port or strong ale. This is 
an old Scotch custom, now however generally going out 
of fashion. All this is of course adapted for a large 
party. For three or four persons a selection from the 
above will be all that is requisite. — N, B, Hot plates 
should be provided for all hot meats. 

The order of service above described is not altogether 



176 REMARKS ON DINNERS. 

a mere regulation of fashion or caprice. There is 
a good reason for it in the qualities of the food. 
The fish and soup being slightly stimulating, prepare 
the stomach for the more substantial and cloying 
roasts &c,, after which the fruits and sweets come 
as a grateful relief to the palate. 

Suppers. — This meal should be light as compared 
with dinner^ and therefore large hot roasts &c. are of 
course itiappropriate. Where hot dishes are required, 
the best are tripe, or poultry, with potatoes, — broiled 
fish, devils, well- seasoned ragouts, hashes, fricassees, 4kc. 
Cold meats are however most generally preferred ; — 
roasts (left at dinner, if not too much cut up), meat 
pies, salads, cold fowls with ham or tongue, potted 
head, oysters, &c. These may be followed as at dinner 
by sweets, such as jellies, tarts, custards, fruit pies, Slc, 
after which may come a dessert similar to that served 
at dinner. 

Of course, with regard to both dinners and suppers, 
good taste will dictate that the extent of the service 
should be so proportioned to the number of the company 
that there may be enough, without unnecessary profusion. 
Decorations, consisting of either real or imitation fruits 
or other eatables, not to be eaten, are symptoms of vul- 
garity not to be tolerated. A vase of flowers in the 
centre of the table is, however, an admissible and 
pleasing ornament. 



Here, having concluded all we have to say on the 
choice and preparation of food, we are much disposed 
to pause, and say to our readers with at least as much 
sincerity as the Thane of old did to his guests, " May 
good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both ;" 
but the custom of cookery-books compels us to 
say a few words on the art of carving, and on the periods 
of the year in which the various viands will be found 
in greatest perfection. 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 177 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 

Obsbryation and practice onlj can confer facility in 
earying, written directions being inadequate to convey 
piore than a general idea of the mpst artistic mode. 
As a general rule, butcher-meat should not be cut across 
the gntin, (ea^ecial^lj if it. is to reappear at table cold), 
as this at once lets out the gravy, which is better in the 
meat. 'Slices of vBe^fj Veal, Ham, Tongue, and Fowl, 
should be cut thin, and if a slanting direction be taken 
they will in general be larger. Mutton, Lamb, and 
Pork may be carved in thicker slices. A sharp knife 
is essential to pomfort and neatness in carving. A 
small piece of fat and a spoonful of gravy should l^e 
helped with each slice, and also some stuffing, where 
that is used. ^ ^ 

, Sirloin of Beef, The under-side should be, cut in slices 
across ; — it is best when hot. The " upper side" is cut 
longitudinoilly from the back-bone towards the ends of 
the ribs. . If it. is likely to be all eaten while hot, begin 
by making a deep cut across the thick end close to the 
backrbone, which will facilitate the separation of the 
slices; otherwise, the fewer incisions made in it the 
better. A little of the under-side fat may be helped 
with each, slice. The Ribs of Beef should be carved in 
the same manner. 

Mound of Beef, After removing an outside slice 
half an inch thick, carve the beef, in thin horizontal 
slices, with a little of the fat to each. The Aitch-bone 
may be carved in the same way. , 

A Bmrt should be cut from the open end to the point. 
> The Zom or Breast, and FillGit,. of Veal, are carved 
similarly to the sirloin and round of beef. 
. Leg of Mutton, . Cut it across, on the iDside of the 
thigh near the small end. When this part is finished, 
gjicesi may be cut from the larger end in a direction 
perpendicular to, the first cut. In a roast, the shank 
end ought to have a fringed paper covering to keep 

N 



178 DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 

the carver^s hand clean when laying hold of it to steady 
the joint or turn it. 

Shoulder of Mutton. Slices are first cut from the 
hollow part near the knuckle end, in a direction across 
the bone. Another set of thin slices maj afterwards 
be cut from above the blade-bone, parallel to its ridge. 
The Saddle of mutton is best carred by dividing the 
meat from the back-bone by passing the knife between 
them, and then cutting the sUces in the same direction 
as in cutting chops. 

Venison. Grenerally in the same way as mutton. 

Fore Quarter of Lamb. First detach the shoulder 
by cutting in a circular direction beneath it, beginning 
at the joint and keeping the point of the knife towards 
the centre ; the brisket (t. e. the gristly ends of the 
ribs) is then cut off by a cut across the whole. It is 
then ready for helping among the company, giving each 
person a rib or two at a time cut like a chop, with a 
piece of the brisket cut in the same direction. The 
Shoulder is carved like a shoulder of mutton. 

The Hind Quarter of Lamb is carved like the leg of 
mutton, only a chop from the loin-part may be helped 
along with each slice from the leg. 

[The back-bone in necks and loins of mutton and 
lamb, or indeed in any part except the saddle, ought 
to be divided at the joints before cooking, wldch will 
greatly facilitate the operations of the carver.] 

Pork is generally carved like mutton. The skin be- 
fore roasting should be scored so as to mark off the 
slices. In Eoast Pig, the shoulders and hind-legs are 
first removed, and then the intermediate parts cut 
across into conveniently sized pieces. 

Ham. Begin with an incision down to the bone, 
about the middle, and on either side of this cut slices 
as thin as possible. 

Tongue. Cut it through obliquely about the middle, 
and then cut thin slices parallel to the first cut. 

Fowl. Hold it firmly with the fork thrust into the 
breast, from which, if large, cut a few slices ; then take 



DIRECTIONS FOR CARVING. 179 

off the left wing, cutting downwards, along with a small 
portion of the flesh of the breast attached. Then sever 
the leg on the same side, cutting in the same direction. 
The limbs of the other side are next separated in the 
same manner. After this, remove the merrythought 
and the neck-bones ; divide the breast from the back, 
either bj tearing them assunder or by cutting through 
the ribs downwards to the tail. Now turn the back, 
outside upwards, and break it in two by fixing the 
knife firmly in the middle, and bending the rump 
upwards with the fork. The side-bones are then cut 
from the rump-half, and the operation is completed. 
To facilitate the separation of the joints of poultry 
when large or tough, there are peculiar modes of 
twisting the limbs with the fork, which can hard)y be 
described, but must be seen and practised to be under- 
stood and learned. The skill required for this, how- 
ever, may now be said to be almost superseded by an 
invention of M. Soyer s, which consists in a mode of 
cutting the sinews before cooking, by means of an in- 
strument called a " Tendon Separator," which not only 
faves trouble to the carver, but makes the bird look 
plumper when cooked, by obviating the effect of the 
contraction of the sinews by the heat. 

Turkey, Cut off the apron or skin of the belly so 
as to get at the stuffing, and then proceed generally iu 
the same manner as with fowl, except that a number 
of thin slices should first be cut lengthways from the 
breast. Less meat from the body is required with the 
wing, as this is larger. 

Ooose or Duck, After removing the apron and carv- 
ing the breast in thin longitudinal slices, remove the 
leg as follows : — Turn the bird over on its side, insert 
the fork into the small end of the leg-bone, and press 
it close to the side, at the same time entering the knife 
above the thigh-joint, which will then rise up, and the 
leg may be separated by a cut in the direction of the 
tail. The wing is now removed by a similar process, 
the joint being started by pressing down the small end

4if the pinion. The dissection is then completed as di- 
rected for fowl. , 

Pigeons are simplj cut in two from head to tail. 
' Wild Fowl and Game should furnish slices from the 
breast^ which is generally esteemed ihe most delicate 
jpsiTjt, Small birds may be carved like pigeons. 
; Hare or Iiabbj4>: After cutting open the apron to 
idisclose the 3tuffing|' remove the shoulders by a circular 
put, ^nd then the hind legs. Cut a slice off each side 
the whole length, at a little distance from the backbone. 
Pivide the back across into three or four parts. The 
bead is divided by^fii^t removing the lower jaw, and 
then' cutting the upper part in two lengthways. 
.^ ^ Fish needs no carving, but should be . neatly, divided 
with a fish, slice at the natural separations between the 
flakes, so as not to mangle these. The roes and other 
-" fancied " parts j^hould be fairly distributed along with 
the slices from the body, ^ried fish is generally sent 
to table in pieces small enough, for helping. 

In " helping " what he oai^ves, the carver ought to 
give each person a moderate supply at a time,— rand not 
heap his plate with a dis-appetizing, profusion. The 
strictest impartiality should regulate his distribution of 
the prime parts : to " deal smaU and serve all" should be 
his maxim. Among these favourite delicacies are — 
>, The fat of venison, — the " pope's eye" in a leg and 
.piutton, — the kidneys of veal and Jamb,~Tthe neck and 
ribs of roast pig, — the breast and-wingsof poultry and 
wild fowl, — the thighs of goose and duck,— the legs of 
duckj-^the legs of hare and rabbitj-r^tljie, jelly and 
.iff^ngm of cod's head, — turbot's fins* — the thin part of 
salmon, — the thick of flat fish generally, &c.

able distribution she has made of her treasures through- 
out the diiferent periods of the year, so as to suit no^ 
onlj the real wants but the tastes of man, varying a«^ 
both these do with the ever changeful seasons. Thus 
during the cold of Winter, when that internal furnace 
of which Liebig speaks as the source of warmth to the. 
animal economy, requires the most abundant and sub* 
stantial supplies of fuel, she has placed at man*s disposal 
in their highest perfection, her fat beef, mutton, 'and 
pork, her substantial geese and turkeys^ her best and 
most nutritious fish, and her hardiest and most solid 
Vegetables. In Spring she invites him to purify his blood 
with her more esculent vegetable productions, and to 
Vary his supplies of animal food by the use of lamb, 
young fowls, and fresh- water fish. To alleviate the 
parching heat of Summer, and to induce him to mode- 
rate his demands on more solid viands, she now offers 
her copious supplies of small fruit, of young potatoes, 
of- tender peas, and of sweet turnip^ — of fish now re- 
novated from the exhaustion attendant on the spawning . 
season,— of a variety of small birds, and of the young 
of the larger fowls. Her " bounty shines in Autumn 
unconfined, and spreads a common feast for all that 
lives.'* Then are gathered those stores of farinaceous 
food on which the mass of mankind chiefly depend for 
sustenance throughout the year — the larger sorts of 
fruit, as well for present use as to serve during the win- 
ter — together with contributions from the produce of 
warmer climates than our own; — many varieties of 
game and shell-fish are also in perfection, and towards 
its close the larger animals are ready to provide us 
again with our winter fare. 

The subjoined table shows concisely the distribution 
of the animal supply. The fruits and vegetables will in 
general be found m best condition when they are most 
abundant in the markets, but as these periods vary with 
the backwardness or forwardness of the season, any ac- 
curate classification of them under particular months is 
next to impossible.

APPENDIX. 



MAXIlfS ON EATING. 

1. Thi atomach should never be filled to auch an extent as 
to cauBe any sensation of uneasy fulness. 

2. Eating should always be sufficiently slow to admit of 
thorough mastication of the food. 

8. Much fluid should not be taken with solid food, it being 
better to drink freely between the meals. 

4. Neither the mind nor the body should be actively exer- 
cised Yery soon after a full meal. 



BBMBDIES FOB INDIGESTION. 

Dr. BuDD, in a recent lecture on disorders of the stomach, 
recomme9ds from half a grain to a grain of ipecacuanha in a 
pill, or a grain of cayenne pepper, with three or four grains of 
rhubarb, as the medicine most effectual in removing the un - 
easiness and sense of oppression sometimes felt after meals, and 
the various other evils that result from slow digestion. The 
best time to take such remedies is just before the meal after 
which uneasiness is felt

none of the common forms of nutritive matter, yet they supply 
a portion of the carbonic acid and watery vapour which are 
constantly being given off by the lungs, and so far supply the 
place of food— of the starch and fat, for example, which we 
usually eat. 2. They diminish (as tea and coffee also do) the 
absolute amount of matter usually given off by the lungs and 
kidneys, and thus have the property of making a given quantity 
of food go further in sustaining the strength and bulk of the 
body. Hence (he says) fermented liquors, if otherwise suitable 
to the constitution, exercise a beneficial influence upon old 
people, and other weakly persons in whom the process of 
digestion does not replace the tissues so fast as they naturally 
waste. Weak alcoholic drinks also gently stimulate the diges-

tive organs, and help them to do their work more fally ; anc^ 
thus the body is sustained to a later period in life. These good 
results, however (he cautions his readers), follow, only from a 
moderate use of them, and in no w«y justify indulgence in them 
to excess, or palliate the moral evils to which this excess inva- 
riably gives rise. 

On this subject Spe5ceb Wells observes, that though the 
stimulus of wine may to a certain extent assist digestion, yet 
there is a danger of more food being thus digested than the 
system requires,, in which case sm unhealthy state of repletion 
ensues. 



COXPABITIYB ANALYSES 01^ VARIOUS ARTICLES OF FOOD. 

Chemists have found Ihat nearly everything used as food, 
both animal and vegetable, is a mixture mainly of two Prin- 
ciples :-^{lsi\ The Nutritive Principle, considered so because 
it is. believed to contribute most to sustain the muscular 
strength; its ultimate elements being in every case nearly 
identical with those of flesh, and chiefly distinguished by in- 
cluding a large proportion of the gas called nitrogen. (2d), 
The {Carbonaceous Principle, so called from its containing 
chiefly carbon or charcoal, combined with the elements of. 
water, viz. hydrogen and oxygen gases. The use of this prin- 
ciple seems to be to maintain the .heat of the body by slowly 
bumingt or chemically combining, with the oxygen, of the air 
which the -blood absorbs during its circulation through the 
lungs.. Both these principles exist in many forms ; — ^us in 
animal substances the first is found in the shape of Casein 
(the curd or cheese of milk), and of Albumen and Fibrin, which 
have been already described in Chapter IV., p. 19 : in vegetable 
substances it is most abundant as insoluble Gluten in every 
variety of com,- and more sparingly^ as Casein ' and Albumen 
dissolved in the juices of plants. The .Carbonaceous Principle 
occurs both in vegetable and animal matter as fat and oil« 
and largely In the former as starch, sugar, gum, and also as 
woody fibre which is not quite so digestible. Of these the fats 
and, oils are generally t^e least digestible, although when 
once assimilated in the blood, they all appear to answer the 
same purpose. 

^ Mixed with these Principles there is generally a larger or 
smaller quantity of water aswell as of mii^eral matter (gene-, 
i^ally Chlorides, and Phosphates) which latter goes to give soli-, 
dity to the bones. ^ . 

With this explanation we now introduce the following table, 
the materials for which have been gathered from Professor 
Johnston^s " Chemistry of Food." ,„.... *. . . ..

1B6 APPENDIX. 

The reader will observe in the foregoing Table the great 
difference which exists between the proportions of the same 
principle in the various articles, whence has arisen the general 
use of a mixed and varied diet in order that these differences 
may be made to counterbalance one another, and a due pro- 
portion in the whole maintained. / The best proportion between 
the two principles is believed to be exhibited in milk ; that 
being the only food provided by nature which, by itself, will 
maintain health and strength. It is remarkable too as being 
the only animal food containing sugar, — a circumstance which 
suggests that our diet should contain some admixture of this 
kind of carbonaceous matter as well as fat 

A remarkable corroboration of this view is found in man's 
instinctive tendency to choose a diet more or less resembling 
milk in its constitution. Thus we generally supply the de- 
ficiency of sugar or starch in butcher-meat by eating along 
with it some farinaceous vegetable such as potatoes ; — to bread, 
fish, cauliflower, and many other articles of food defective in 
fiit, we add butter ; — with cheese we take bread to supply the 
carbonaceous principle ; and we balance the excess of fat in 
pork with cabbage and pease pudding. 



The rapidly stimulating property of beef tea, or broth is 
due to a peculiar crystallizable substance contained in the 
juice of meat called hreaUne, which is remarkable as being 
almost identical in chemical composition with the stimulating 
principles of tea and coffee ; — hence the name of heef tea is 
perhaps singularly appropriate. These substances exist in very 
minute quantities in their respective sources, yet their action 
is not the less certain or powerftd, — producing paralysis if taken 
in too large quantities.
