DIET FOR THE SCHOOL CHILD. 




GOOD FOOD HABITS. 

The child is the adult of to-morrow. The kind of food a child 
has to-day determines to a considerable extent the fitness of the 
future citizen. Those who direct the feeding of the child have a 
responsibility which can not be overlooked. Good food habits should 
start to-day. Tomorrow may be too late. 

1. Meals should he at the same hours each day. — However, if the 
child gets very hungry two hours before the time for the next meal, 
he may be given a slice of bread and butter or a glass of milk. Do 
not give a child candy, fruit, nuts, cake, and cookies between meals. 

2. Plenty of water should he given. — Children as well as adults 
should drink plenty of water between meals. "Water will often 
satisfy the craving which many mistake for hunger, but more than 
twb glasses of water at any one meal should not be taken. Food 

should not be washed down with water during meals. 

3. Children often have to he taught to like things 

which are good for them. — Be patient, but firm, in 

teaching a child to like new food. Begin by giving 

a small amount of a new food ; give but one new food 

at a time, and repeat it regularly until the 

child learns to like it. 

4. Children should not he forced to eat 
when not hungry. — Forced feeding causes 

Children require at least 
four glasses of water be- 
tween meals. Thirst is 
often mistaken for a crav- 
ing for food, and a haMt 
of eating at all times is 
thus developed.

more harm than light eating for a few days. If the appetite does 
not return, consult a physician. 

5. They should he happy while eaiing. — Let the mealtime be a 
joyous occasion, without undue excitement just before, during, or 
after eating. 

6. Plenty of time should he (Mowed for meals. — Insist on thorough 
chewing so that the stomach may not be overtaxed. 

7. Dirt is dangerous. — Children should have clean hands and faces 
while eating; they should sit down to a clean table and eat in an 
orderly manner. Flies should never be allowed to alight on food. 

THE CHILD'S FOOD. 

A child should not be allowed to make his entire meal from one or 
two articles ; he needs a variety of foods to supply all kinds of grow- 
ing material. He can not develop normally unless he has this variety. 



Every day the diet of the child should contain some of each of the 
following types of foods: 

1. Milk^ which is the best and most important food for growing 
children. No other food can take its place. Children over 5 years 
of age should have at least three cups a day, and more where possible. 
Milk should not be given very cold. Warm milk is more easily 
digested. Oftentimes milk can be taken warm when it causes dis- 
tress if taken cold. If children rebel against drinking milk alone, it 
may be given in the form of cocoa, milk soups, custards, etc. Where 
it is impossible to get fresh milk, dried milk or evaporated milk 
may be used. If evaporated or dried skimmed milk is given, cliil- 
dren should have plenty of vegetables, especially green and leafy 




Everyone who would 
have a good digestion 
must eat slowly and mas- 
ticate his food thor- 
oughly. 



vegetables, suitable fruit or fruit juices, and some cream or butter. 
Tea and cofee should not he given to growing children at all. 

The first food a family should buy is milk. 
The last food to be dispensed with is milk. 

— Dairy Bureau of Massachusetts. 

2. Eggs, fish, fowl, or meat, or their equivalents. — ^Where plenty of 
milk and an egg a day are included in the diet of the child, very little 
meat need be given before the seventh year. Allow not more than 2 
ounces of meat daily for a child from 7 to 10 years ; 3 ounces daily 
from 10 to 14 years. The broth from stews may be given on vege- 
tables and bread. Where meat and eggs can not be purchased because 
of cost and scarcity, the diet should contain a quart of milk, with pea 
or bean soups, spinach and other green vegetables, oatmeal, and dried 
fruits. Vegetables and fruits are also excellent sources of iron and 
other elements necessary for growth, and, combined with milk, will 
supply food value more than equal to meat. 



3. Breads cereals^ and other grain 'products. — These should furnish 
at least one-third of the food required by the child. The most nour- 
ishing ones should be included in the diet; cereals and flours with 
some of the outside of the grain are more nourishing than the refined 
flours. Hence, entire wheat flour and brown rice are better than 
white flour and white rice. They also help to prevent constipation. 
The following list gives the cereals and flours in the order of the 
amount of nourishment which they contain, and their rating, based 
upon the proportion of the chief elements in the food which are neces- 
sary for growth: 



Oatmeal 2, 500 

Force 2, 300 

Shredded wheat 2,200 

Graham flour 2, 200 

Barley 1, 450 

Rye flour 1,450 

Cornmeal 1, 350 



Macaroni 1,350 

Cream of wheat 1,350 

Farina 1, 350 

White wheat flour 1, 250 

Hominy 1, 150 

Rice (white) 1,150 

Corn flakes 1,100 




How many bottles of milk are delivered at your doorf Dr. Graham Luak says: "No 
family of five should huy meat until they have bought three quarts of milk." 

To reduce this to a cost basis, divide the rating given above by the 
cost per pound and compare the food value with the money spent. 

Cereals and breads may be varied and the food value increased by 
the addition of dried fruits. Dates when washed and chopped in 
small pieces make a valuable addition- to cooked cereal. Stewed 
prunes, figs, or other dried fruit may be used in the same way. They 
are especially good with hominy and other white cereals. Mixed 
cereals offer a great variety of flavors. Two or three kinds may be 
cooked together. 



Cereals should be thoroughly cooked. If children do not like them, 
it is usually because they have not been properly cooked and served. 
They need long, slow cooking over boiling water or in a fireless 
cooker. The cereal may be cooked the night before and reheated 
in the morning in a double boiler, or by setting the dish in a pan of 
hot water. 

Directions for caoMng cereals : Stir the cereal into the right amount 
of boiling salted water, and cook over direct heat until the cereal ' 
thickens, stirring constantly. Then set into boiling water or the 
fireless cooker and cook as long as directed without further stirring. 
Proportions are as follows: 

1 cup of cornmeal, 6 cups water, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls salt ; cook 3 hours. 

1 cup of wheat preparations, such as wheatena, cream of wheat, farina, etc., 
4 to 6 cups water, 1 to 2 teaspoonfuls salt ; cook 1 hour. 

1 cup of hominy or hominy grits, 4 cups water, 1 teaspoonful salt; cook 3 
hours. 

1 cup of rolled oats, 2 to' 2^ cups water, one-half teaspoonful salt ; cook 2 to 
3 hours. Cereals may also be cooked in whole or skimmed milk instead of 
water. 




Cooh your child's breakfast cereal toith the dinner the night "before. In the morning it 
only needs to be heated. A well-oookei^ oereal should form an essential part of a oMld'S 
Itreakfast. 

Uncooked or " dry " cereals may be given occasionally, if cost can 
be disregarded. With milk and fruit they make an agreeable sup- 
per dish. It should be remembered, however, that by volume it takes 
two or three times as much of these dry cereals to supply the same 
amount of food as of cooked cereal. 

Cereals should be served with milk and not more than one tea- 
spoonful of sugar to a saucerful of cereal. For those who take them 
well without sugar it may be omitted altogether. 



Flours and cereals may be made into bread, puddings, soups, 
cookies, etc. 

4. Vegetables form a very essential part of the diet. They are 
especially necessary when the amount of milk is small. They are 
very important in helping to guard against constipation. Often- 
times hunger is due to the absence of vegetables in the meals, and 
children who crave more food find their appetites satisfied where 
vegetables are given regularly. Potatoes, baked, boiled, or mashed, 
should be given practically every day. Other valuable vegetables are 
dried and fresh peas and beans, spinach, onions, tomatoes, string 
beans, carrots, squash, turnips, cauliflower, asparagus, stewed celery, 
and for older children parsnips and oyster plant. In summer all 
kinds of greens, such as beet tops, turnip tops, dandelions, chard, and 
cooked lettuce should be used freely. Dried and canned vegetables, 
if of good quality, may also be given in winter. Almost all vege- 
tables except cabbage, cucumbers, and corn may be used freely after 
the fifth year. In soups and stews more vegetables and less meat 
should be used than is common practice. Meat should be used chiefly 
for flavoring. 

Much valuable food material dissolves in the water in which 
vegetables are cooked. So far as possible use this water in the mak- 
ing of meat gravies and soups. Vegetables should be cooked only 
long enough to become tender. 

5. Fruit. — There should be some fruit in the diet every day. 
Where fresh fruit is not possible, dried fruiti may be substituted. 
Fresh fruit should be very ripe, but not decomposed. Bananas are 
not ripe until the skins have brown spots. If served before this 
stage, they should be baked or boiled. Canned fruit and jellies may 
be used, but jams and preserves are too sweet for frequent use. 

6. Sweets. — There is great danger of children getting too much 
sugar and spoiling the appetite and the digestion. Children should 
not have, all told, more than the following amounts : 

5 to 7 years 1 tablespoonful daily. 

7 to 12 years 2 tablespoonfuls daily. 

Sugar is less likely to be harmful when taken in cocoa, rice, or 
simple puddings, custards, or in dried fruits, fresh fruits, and vege- 
tables. Sirups and honey may be given in place of sugar. ^Vhatever 
sweets are given should be at the end of a meal ; never between meals 
or at the beginning of a meal. They spoil the appetite for other 
necessary food. 

7. Fat is essential for growing children. Milk fat (cream and 
butter) is the most important kind. Children should, if possible, 
have unskimmed milk. If the cream is removed from their milk, 
they should have butter. Other fats or oils, such as nut butter, oleo- 



margarine, corn, olive oil or cottonseed oil, may be given in addition 
to the butter fat, but not in place of it. Fats other than butter 
should not be given as the only fat except when the diet contains 
unskimmed milk and plenty of vegetables. 

Fat is more easily digested uncooked. All fried foods should be 
avoided. 

PLANNING THE MEALS. 

The meals of a school child should be planned to give enough 
variety and to provide all the growing material needed. The follow- 
ing suggestions will help to provide well-balanced meals for school 
children : 

I. Beeaktast should contain milk, bread and butter, and in addi- 
tion, cereal, fruit, or egg when possible. 

Milk. — ^Part may be eaten on a cereal, the rest drunk plain or in 
cocoa. 

Bread should be a day old or toasted (whole wheat, oatmeal, com 
meal, rye, barley, or white or any other wholesome bread). 

Butter, oleomargarine, nut margarine, or some other fat may be 
used. Butter should be used if the cream has been removed from the 
milk. 

Cereals.— The best are oatmeal, wheatena, pettijohn, barley, corn 
meal, samp, hominy grits, rice, farina, cream of wheat.

A hot lunch at 
school is most de- 
sirable for chil- 
dren who can not 
go home at noon. 
By means of it 
children may ie taught food 
values and also they become 
accustomed to eating the hinda 
of food they should have. 




Fruit may be orange, stewed or fresh apple, ripe pear or peach, 
thoroughly ripe or cooked banana, stewed dried fruit, such as dates, 
figs, prunes, apples, or peaches. 

The fresh fruits in season are to be preferred where it is possible 
to obtain them; they are usually expensive, however, and one often 
gets much better return for the money in dried fruit. 

Eggs may be given soft boiled, poached, scrambled (plain or in 
milk) and omelet. Fried eggs should not be given. 

II. Dinner, or the heaviest meal, should preferably be in the 
middle of the day. This is not feasible when the child must hurry 
home from school, eat rapidly and rush back; nor when the child 
must carry his lunch to school; nor when the mother can prepare 
but one dinner a day and the father must have his at night. For a 
light midday meal, give a vegetable or a milk soup, bread and butter, 
a simple dessert, or the meals hereafter indicated for supper. 

An ideal dinner should consist of soup, meat or eggs, vegetables, 
bread and butter and dessert and milk to drink. 

Clear meat soups or broths have very little nourishment. Soups for 
children should be made from dried peas or beans, or with fresh 
vegetables, such as potato, spinach, carrots, peas and onions; such 
soups with the addition of rice or barley and milk make a very 
nourishing dish. Milk and vegetable soups may take the place of 
meat or eggs in the dinner. 

Meat or fish should be given but once a day, and the quantity should 
not be large. Lean beef, mutton, lamb, chicken, and such fish as cod, 
haddock, and halibut are the most desirable kinds. 

Vegetables should form a large part of the diet, especially in sum- 
mer. A list of those available has already been given. 

Bread and butter should always be given.

child candy or do 
you give Mm whole- 
some food when he 
is really hungry 6e- 
tween meals f 




Dessert, — ^With plenty of bread and butter and vegetables, des- 
sert is not essential. When given it should always be plain and 
simple. The most wholesome desserts are cereal puddings made 
with milk and fruit, such as rice, oatmeal, baked Indian or bread 
pudding, or plain cookies, or cake and cocoa, or fruit custards, 
junkets, ice cream or ices, stewed dry or fresh fruit, or sliced orange. 

Suggested dinner combinations are given in later pages. 

III. Supper. — The supper, when the hearty meal is given at mid- 
day, should be a simpler meal. Grive dishes made of milk, eggs, 
finely chopped vegetables, cereals, and fruit, rather than meat, whole 
vegetables, and sweet desserts. 

Some suggestions for supper are as follows : 
Bread and milk, baked potato, stewed fruit. 
Cereal and milk, bread and butter, baked banana. 
Poached egg on toast, baked potato, bread and butter, apple sauce, 
and ginger bread. 

IV. Basket or School Luncheon. — ^The child needs at least three 
good meals a day. If he has to carry a luncheon to school, it should 
be a substantial one, which will give him nourishment enough to 
keep him from getting exhausted during the afternoon. The hot 
midda'y meal is to be preferred; but it is better to carry a well- 
balanced luncheon than to hurry home, bolt half the dinner for fear 



When a hot lunch is not 
furnished at school, sand- 
wiches with jam or pea- 
nut hutter, irwit, custard 





or simple pudding, and a 
cup of milk make a suit' 
able iasket lunch, easitg 
prepared. 




of being late, and get exhausted before the end of the day. It is 
desirable to have hot soup, plain milk, or cocoa at school ; it is then 
easy to supplement this. If, however, he must carry the whole 
luncheon, it must be a nutritious as well as an appetizing one. 

Suggestions for a basket luncheon: The most feasible are sand- 
wiches, dessert, fruit, and a bottle of milk. 

For sandwiches use the most nourishing kinds of bread, such as 
whole wheat, oatmeal, brown, raisin, or nut bread. Appetizing fill- 
ings may be egg, chopped meat, cheese (American), fresh cottage 
cheese plain or combined with dried fruit, sliced tomatoes, chopped 



vegetables such as beets or lettuce, jelly, or peanut butter and 
chopped raisins or dates. 

A baked custard adds variety. 

If fruit is not included in the filling of the sandwiches, a small 
glass jar of some stewed fruit or apple sauce may be added, or some 
fresh ripe fruit or a few dates. 

For dessert, ginger, date, or plain cookies, with cheese, sponge 
cake, gingerbread, or sweet chocolate. It is easy to get a small jar 
with a tight screw top for sauce, puddings, and custards and to get 
a bottle for carrying milk. 



The child uho iolts Ms micMay meal and then rusJies back to school can nether 
work nor digest properly.

SUMMARY. 

The conservation of the health of the child is more important than 
the conservation of food. 

Every child should have at least 1 pint of milk a day either to 
drink or in his food. It is the very best food there is. He should 
drink plenty of water between meals. ChUdren should not drink tea 
or coffee at all. 

There should be plenty of bread and cereals, particularly oatmeal 
and whole- wheat breads, which should be used freely. They are 
better for growing children than white bread. 

Children can not be healthy and strong unless they have plenty of 
vegetables every day. Fresh vegetables are to be preferred, but 
when these are unobtainable, dried or canned vegetables should be 
given. Fruits are necessary and should be given every day if possible. 

Fish may be substituted for meat, and eggs may be given four or 
five times a week. 

Milh., vegetables, and cereals are more necessary than meat and 
should he provided first. 



Highly seasoned foods are usually prefer7-ed ly children, hut simpler foods are much 

more wholesome.
