to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 
to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 
are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

Hannah widdifhsj), 

CfMrstaS/M* aiofiir Ttaan for 1k$ mperiority if etoery artide tkt made, im 
SmUi, NvUh Street, above Bl^niet, PhUaddpfua, 

Oomplete in one large duodeeimo Toliuney'itronf ly bonxid. Prfoe 
One Dollar. 

There is not a lady Uvisgi bat should possess themselves of a 
oopy of this work at once. It wiU give yon all better meals and 
make your oost of living less, and keep your husbands, sons, and 
brothitra in an excellent hnmor. It is recommended by thousands, 
and ik the best and only complete Book on all kinds of Cookery ex- 
tant. It is written 80 tba£ all can understand iU It is taking the place 
of all other Cook Books, for a person possessin^^'' WIDDIFIELD'S 
KEW COOK BOOK" needs no other, as a copy of this is worth all 
the other books, called Cook Books, in the World. 

B«ad what Ae Editor of the Dollar Nototpapmr taifs about it, 

"The authoresa of thie work long enjoyed great celebrity with the 
best families in Philadelphia as the most thoroughly informed lady 
in her profession in this country. Her Bstablishment, on Ninth 
above Spruce street, has long enjoyed the patronage of the best 
livers in our city. The receipts cover almost every variety of cake 
or dish, and every species of cooking. One great advantage which 
this book enjoys over almost every other is the simplicity with which 
the ingredients are set forth, and the comparatively modoraJa cost 
at which particular receipts may be got up. In most cook books the 
directions cover so large a oodt, that to common livers the directions 
had almost as well not be given. This objection has been mcasura^ 
bly removed in this new volume. Another important matter is, no 
receipts are contained in it but those fully tested, not only by the 
author, but by cooks uid housekeepers most competent to Judge. 
The volume opens with directions for soup, for fish, oysters, meat,' 
ponltry, etc* In addition to all this, much attention has been given 
to diredlions for the preparation of dishes fur tbo sick and conva- 
lescent. Mr. Peterson has issued the volume in handson» style, 
wisely, as we think, using large type and ^ood paper. The book is 
Boid at, or will be sent to any part of the Union, free of postage^ on 
laoeipt of One Dollar."

"A number of good books on thii subject have been published

Its superiority is in the deaniess, and brevity, and the praotioal 
directness of the receipts; they are easily understood and followed* 
The book looks like what it is, the ripe firuit of many years' suft- 
oeesftd practice. The establishment of Mrs. Widdiileld has for many 
years held the first rank in Philadelphia for thevnrarying excellence 
of every article there made ; and now she crowns her well ^served 
eelebrity by giring to the world the beet book that hoe bee^ tmUenon

to undertake the management of household aifairs, can make herself 
an aocompl^hed caterer for the table without serving an apprentice- 
ship to the business. The book is published in one volume, the

PREFACE. 



The anthor, in preparing this work, has en- 
deavored to make the contents as plain and ex- 
plicit as possible, in order that thj)^ may be 
found practicable by the yonng, as well as the 
more experienced housewife. 

Much attention has been paid to that portion 
of the book which appertains particularly to the 
preparation of dishes for the sick, as also the 
oonvalescent. 

V "No receipts are contained in this volume but 
those fiiUy tested, not only by the author, but 
by the best judges in this, as well as other cities. 
Therefore, it is hoped this work will meet the 
approbation of the pablic, and be found by all 
house-keepers, an invaluable acquisition.

WIDDIFIELD'S 

RECEIPTS FOR COOKING. 



DIBECrnONS FOB SOUP. 

Meat for soup should be fresh, tender, and 
not too fat; and in order to extract all the 
juice, it requires long and slow boiling, 
and should not be removed from the kettle 
until perfectly tender. 

When about half done, salt may be added 
to taste, and every particle of scum, with 
a portion of the fat, removed as it rises. 
If the family is large, and more soup than 
ordinary required, and not sufficient time to 
> admit of boiling the meat as long and tender 
as requisite, it may be prepared the day pre- 
vious; ^d when thoroughly boiled, the 
meat removed from the kettle, the liquor

poured into queensware vessels^ and set in a 
cool place until next morning. The fat may 
then be removed in a solid cake (retaining 
suflBcient to make the soup of proper rich- 
ness), the liquor returned to the kettle, the 
vegetables prepared, and the soup made as 
directed in article 1st. 

Soup-kettles should be well-tinned; and 
before, as after using, well washed and dried. 
If put away damp, and covered, they very 
soon become musty; and, although well 
washed, the odor is partially retained, by 
which the flavor of the soup is greatly 
sppiled. 

When the weather is cold, soup remaining 
from dinner, may be warmed over next day, 
and if rather thick, a little boiling water 
added, and more seasoning, if required. It is 
of equal savor, and considered by many 
superior to that fresh made. ^ 

During the summer months, soup should 
never be eaten the next day, or the liquor 
prepared until a few hours before wanted.

widdifield's receipts fob cooEiva. 35 

Sugar is an indispensable ingredient to 
all soups, and should be scorched until a 
very dark brown, and stirred in while boil- 
ing. 

One table-spoonful of sugar is sufficient for 
three quarts of soup. 



SHDT OF BEEF SOUP. 

1. Take a small shin of beef, crack the 
bone, take off all the tough outside skin, 
wash and put it on to boil in a kettle 
with six or eight quarts of water and two 
table-spoonsful of salt. After boiling per- 
fectly tender (which will take quite four 
hours), take it out of the liquid, to which 
add more salt, if necessary, two onions cut 
in small pieces, eight turnips cut in quar- 
ters, one carrot sliced small, one large table- 
spoonful of sugar, a little sweet marjoram 
and thyme rubbed fine,, and one red pepper 
cut in very small pieces. 

Thicken this moderately with flour and

water made into the consistenoy of thick 
cream, which stir in while boiling. Care 
must be taken not to have the soup made 
too thick with this mixture. About three 
quarters of an hour before the soup is served, 
put in eight potatoes cut into quarters. 
Then make some very small dumplings with 
a quarter of a pound of flour, two ounces of 
butter, a little salt, and sufficient water to 
make a dough. These dumplings require 
about ten minutes to boil. When put into 
the soup they must not be much larger than 
a nutmeg. When all are done, just before 
going to table, add some parsley chopped 
very fine. 

If noodles should be preferred to dump* 
lings, take a quarter of a pound of flour, a 
little salt, and as many yolks of eggs as will 
make it into a sti£f dough. Boll it out very 
thin, flour it well, and let it remain on the 
{>ie-board to dry; then roll it up as you 
would a sheet of paper, and cut with a sharp 
knife into slips as thin as straws; after all

are cut^ mix them lightly together, and to 
prevent them &om adhering, keep them well 
floured. 

A shin, or the tender part of a round of 
beef, will make soup sufGicient for two days. 

Meat (either beef or veal)^ removed from 
the kettle before adding the vegetables, 
minced tolerably fine, and put into a stew- 
pan with a piece of butter, seasoned with salt, 
black and cayenne pepper mixed with vine- 
gar to taste; set over a slow fire, stirred 
well together, and sent to table, hot^ makes 
a very nice relish for either breakfast or tea. 



CHICEEH SOUP. 

2. Clean and wash a large fat chicken, 
put it on to boil in about four (][uarts of 
water, to which add half a tea-cupful of rice, 
one onion cut fine, four or five turnips pared 
and cut into small pieces, one dessertrspoon- 
ful of white sugar, a little sweet marjoram, 
with salt and red pepper to taste, ^fter

boiling over a slow fire for rather more than 
an hour^ then put in six white potatoes, 
pared, washed, and cut in quarters, which 
as soon as done, add a little parsley minced 
fine. When done, if not sufficiently sea- 
soned, more may be added. Place the 
chicken on a dish, which garnish with sprigs 
of double parsley, the soup in a tureen, and 
send to table hot. 



CUIUUUi BBOTK 

3. Take a nice tender chicken, and after 
cleanihg it very nicely, cut it into quarters, 
and put it into a soup kettle with three quarts 
of water, two table-spoonsful of rice, or 
pearl barley, and salt to taste. Let it boil 
slowly, and as the scum rises, remove it. 
When thoroughly done, place the chicken 
on a dish, garnish with double parsley, and 
eat with drawn butter, and serve the broth 
in a deep<x>vered china bowl, or tureen, and 
sen^ to table hot.

TEAL SOUP. 

4. Take a knuckle of veal, crack the 
bone, wash and put it on to boil in more 
than sufficient water to cover it. After boil- 
ing some time, pare, cut, and wash two 
onions, five or six turnips, and put in with 
the meat. When this has boiled one hour, 
add some sweet marjoram rubbed fine with 
salt and cayenne pepper to taste. Then take 
flour, which mix with cold water to the con- 
sistency of cream, and add to the soup while 
boiling. Care must be taken not to make it 
too thick. Then pare, and cut into small 
pieces six or eight potatoes, which wash and 
add about half an hour before being served ; 
and about ten minutes before sending to tar 
ble, put in a few dumplings, made as in ar- 
ticle No. 1. 

As veal makes a white soup, the color is 
much improved by adding a table-spoonful 
of scorched sugar. This soup may be 
thickened with rice, if preferred.

COILS SOUP. 

5. To each qaart of young com cut from 
the cob, allow three pints of water. Put the 
com and water on to boil, and as soon as the 
grains are tender, have ready two ounces of 
sweet butter mixed with one table-spoonful 
of flour. Stir the flour and butter into the 
com and water, and let it boil ten or fifteen 
minutes longer. Just before the soup is 
taken out of the pot, beat up an egg and stir 
into it^ with salt and pepper to your taste.

BEAS SOUP. 

6. Take three pints of dried white beans, 
pick, wash, and put them in a kettle with 
three quarts of water. Let them simmer, 
and when they commence to shrink, drain 
them in a colander ; return them to the ket- 
tle, and. pour over three quarts of boiling 
water. Then wash and put in two pounds 
of pickled pori^. Let them cook slowly.

IAMB SOUP. 

7. Take the leg or neck and breast of 
lamb, which wash and put into a soup kettle 
with four or five quarts of water (according 
to the size of the family), one large teaK^up* 
ful of rice, six or eight turnips, pared, washed 
and cut into small pieces, two onions cut finb, 
a little sweet marjoram with salt, black and 
red pepper to taste. After boiKng over a slow 
fire about one hour, then pare and cut into 
quarters six or eight white potatoes, which 
wash, and ad^ with one table-spoonful of 
white sugar. When nearly done, add a lit- 
tle parsley minced fine. Then place the meat 
on a dish, which garnish with parsley, the 
soup in a tureen, and send to table hot. 

This is equally nice, made precisely in the 
Bame manner as veal soup.

OBSERVATIONS ON FISH. 

Stale fish are most unwholesome articles 
of foody and never cook as nicely as those 
fresh caught ; the flesh being soft and flabby, 
they almost invariably break before half 
cooked. 

To have them well prepared, and of good 
flavor, depends much upon the selection. 

If the eyes are bright, the gills red, and 
the whole fish firm, they are fresh; i^ on 
the contrary, the eyes are sunk, the gills 
pale, and the fish soft, they are stale, and 
unfit to eat. 

Pish for frying should be scaled, cleaned, 
scored, washed in cold water, and dried 
(each one separately) on a clean fish towel ;

widdifield's receipts for cooking. 43 

well seasoned with salt and cayenne pepper, 
and dredged with flour. Then frierf in fresh 
lard (slowly) over a clear fire, until well 
done and of a fine brown on both sides. 

Those intended for boiling require equal 
care in cleaqing. Eemove the scales, eyes 
and gills, empty the insides and scrape the 
back bone. Then wash them in cold water, 
and boil in a fish kettle with a strainer 
affixed ; if without the strainer, the fish must 
then be dredged with flour, wrapped in a 
towel, and put into sufficient hot salted 
water to cover them. 

Fish of medium size will boil in half an 
hour. 



BBOILEB SEAS. 



9. Scale, wash and score the shad, thep 
mix together one tablctepoonful of salt, and 
one of sugar ; rub this over the fish, and let 
it remain for two hours; then wash it again, 
dry it on a towel, and season with cayenne

pepper and salt. Heat the gridiron and 
butter the bars; broil it gradually; when 
one side is well browned, turn it. When 
done, place it on a dish ; baste with butter 
and send to table hot. 

Many persons are^ very fond of the roe of 
shad ; wash them carefully, then parboil in 
salted water. When done, season with salt 
and cayenne pepper, dredge with i^ur, and 
fry in fresh lard — ^a fine brown on both 
sides — send to table hot. 



BAKED SHAB. 



10. Clean, score and wash the shad, 
then season well with salt and cayenne pep- 
per. Put it in a pan, cut a quarter of a 
pound of butter into small pieces and place 
over the out and inside of the fish. Bake 
in a quick oven ; when well done and hand- 
somely browned, put it on a dish and send 
to table hot. •

SOirSED SHAD. 

11. Take a fine large shad, clean and 
cut it into quarters, put it into a fish kettle 
and let it hoil about twenty minutes in 
salted water; when done put it on a dish to 
drain ; and when perfectly cold, place it in 
a deep bowl, seasoning each piece with a 
little more salt (if necessary), cayenne and 
a few grains of allspice ; then add sufficient 
cider vinegar to cover it. In a few days 
this will be fit to eat; and found a very 
nice relish for tea. 



TO POT SHId. 

12. Clean the shad, take off the tail, 
head, and all the fins, then cut it in pieces, 
wash and wipe it dry. Season each piece 
well with salt and cayenne pepper. Lay 
them in layers in a stone jar; place between 
each, layer some allspice, cloves and stick 
cinnamon. Cover them with good cider vine-

in a moderate oven and let them remain 
three or four hours. 



TO CUBE SHAD. 



13. Clean and wash fifty large shad^ 
put a layer of salt on the bottom of the ves- 
sel in which you wish to cure them, then a 
layer of shad, and so continue until all are 
in, then cover the top with salt. Let them 
remain in this twenty-four hours, after which 
take them out, and wipe them dry. Mix 
one pound of brown sugar with a <]Luarter of 
a pound of pulverized saltpetre, which stir 
together with equal proportions of rock and 
fine salt, in quantity sufficient to cure the 
number of shad ; put a layer of this mixture 
on the bottom of the vessel, then a layer of 
shad, and so on, until all are under cover, 
putting a thick layer on the top. Shad 
cured in this way may be taken out of the 
brine, washed and boiled, or soaked for a

as shad. (See article 12.) 



BOILED BOCK USE. 



15. Scale, empty, and clean the inside 
perfectly. Take out the eyes and gills ; and 
after washing it in cold water, dredge over 
a little flour. !E^ut it into a fish kettle of 
hot salted water, and, if of medium size, half 
an hour will boil it. When done and well 
drained, place it carefully on a dish, which 
garnish with sprigs of double parsley. Eat 
with drawn butter, fish sauce, catsup, or any 
other preferred. Sheep's head, shad, and all 
other fish to be boiled, are prepared and 
aerved in the like manner.

16. Take a salt salmon, wash and cover 
it with plenty of clear water. Let it soak 
twenty-four hours, but be careful to change 
the water several times. Then scale it, cut 
it into four parts, wash it clean, and put it 
oa to boil. When half done, change the 
water, and as soon as it is tender, drain it, 
put it in a stone pan, sprinkle some cayenne 
pepper, whole allspice, a few cloves, and a 
little mace, over each piece. Cover it with 
cold vinegar. 

This is a very nice relish for tea. 



SALTED COD USE. 



17. Wash and soak it all night. Boil 
it in fresh* water till sufficiently done, but do 
not let it break. Take it out and remove

bard boiled eggs and add to it Put the 
whole in a sauce-pan, and heat it well before

by mincing it on their plates with mashed 
potatoes, boiled onions, egg sauce, cayenne 
and mustard.

HEATS, FOULTBTt &C. 

Beef. — The middle ribs and sirloin are 
considered the best pieces for roasting, and 
require to be well cooked, and handsomely 
browned, without being burnt, or over-done. 

Pieces weighing from ten to twelve pounds, 
will take quite three hours and a half to cook, 
either before a clear fire, or in a moderately 
hot oven. 

The chuck rib, brisket, and round, are 
thought (by epicures) to be the more infe- 
rior parts ; nevertheless, they may be made, 
by proper cooking, of equal, if not superior 
flavor. 

Steaks cut from the sirloin, or tender 
part of the round, are best, and require to 
be quickly broiled over clear bright coals. 
These, as other meats cooked on the gridiron, 
should be kept closely covered while broil- 
ing, with either a plate, small dish, or sheet 
of tin, as most convenient. By so doing, 
the heat penetrates more quickly, the meat 
less dry, and the flavor much improved.

Veal, mutton. Iamb, and pork (when 
roasted), require to be well cooked, and are 
much more palatable over, rather than 
under-done. 

Poultry, when old and tough, is Hcver as 
savory when cooked, as those which are 
young and tender. One of the best rules to 
judge of this, is by the finely-grained skin, 
pUableness of the feet, and ease with which 
the wing joints are broken. 

Poultry of all kinds require very careful 
cleaning, and when . roasted, should be filled 
with well-seasoned dressing, thoroughly done, 
and handsomely browned. Nothing is much 
more insipid than the taste of their flesh, 
when 'badly seasoned, and half cooked. 

A large turkey will take firom three to 
three and a half hours to roast; fowls of 
medium size, firom one and a half to two 
hours. 

There being no general rules for roasting,

of different kinds, must depend upon their 
size, and the heat by which they are cooked. 

To boil meats or poultry, always put them 
into hot water, moderately salted. Remove 
every particle of scum, as it rises, and let 
them boil slowly, until perfectly tender, with- 
out being disjointed. 

For frying, butter should be seldom used. 
It scorches very soon ; for that reason, it is 
not so well adapted for the purpose as fresh 
lard. There are some few dishes, requiring 
an equal portion of each, aa seen in the fol- 
lowing receipts.

time) than sufficient to line the plate, which 
roll of moderate thickness. Then dredge 
with a little flour, fold it over, and roll again 
until the size of the plate, in which it is to 
bake. Always roll it much thinner in the 
centre, than at the edge. Slightly butter the 
plate, put in the paste, pat it close to the 
sides (being very careful not to touch the 
edge). Then trim round with a sharp knife, 
put in the filling, and cover with paste, rolled 
moderately thin; trim round again, and 
notch tastefully, or let it remain plain, if 
preferred. 

When lining plates with paste for lemon, 
or other puddings, the edge must be rathei

more than a quarter of an inAi thick, and 
the centre and sides rolled quite thin with 
a very small rolling pin, three or four inches 
in length, and of corresponding thickness. 

Always bake pies and puddings in tin 
plates. The paste browns much better, and 
becomes more thoroughly baked, which 
makes them more digestible than when 
brought to table with the crust, in the cen- 
tre and sides, thick, soddened, and half done.

Dredge with flour, and fold oyer the sides, 
forming a square. Then roll until of mod- 
erate thickness, and add another quarter; 
and so continue, until all the butter is rolled 
in, obserying to roll quickly, and handle as 
little as possible, as the warmth of the hand 
softens the butter. When the last quarter 
is in, roll until about half an inch thick, then 
cut the paste in quarters, place it on a dish, 
and set it in a very cold place, for two or 
three hours. 

When the weather is warm, mix with ice 
water, and as soon as the paste is made, 
place it between the folds of a clean towel^ 
and put it on ice, until hard.

Ik selecting frdit for preserves, it should 
always be of the finest and least defective ; 
and much care taken to remove all the bruised 
or decayed parts; by allowing them to remain, 
they darken the syrup, and, consequently, 
the beauty of the preserve is lost. The best 
loaf sugar should always be used, unless for 
immediate use ; it requires less skimming, and 
is not so apt to ferment. The Russian isin- 
glass, as also the white of egg, may be used 
for clearing. The former should be prepared 
some hours previous to using, by pouring

IHTBODTrCTOBT REMATtTTB, 

In making all kinds of cake, the ingre- 
dients used should be of the best quality. The 
flour superfine, and always sifted. The butter

salt Pulverized white sugar is best for all 
cake and puddings requiiV^ it. 

Much particularity should be observed in 
breaking and separating eggs^ and equal 
care taken as regards their freshness. One 
imperfect egg would spoil the whole pre- 
viously broken. Break each one separately 
in a tearcup^ and then put them into the pan 
in which they are to be whisked. 

To separate them, break the egg, and 
drop the yolk from one half of the shell to 
the other, letting the white fall into the cup 
beneath. Never use an* egg when the white 
is the least discolored. In the spring and 
summer, those Ijghtly tinged with green aie 
very bad, and although the yolk may look 
perfect, nevertheless to use them, would 
spoil the flavor of any cake or pudding. 

Before whisking the whites, remove every 
particle of yolk which may have accidentally 
dropped in; when allowed to remain, it 
greatly prevents their becoming as stiff and 
dry as required.

Always whisk eggs in an earthen pan^ 
and with wooden rods ; those of metal are 
very good, but by frequent using (unless 
very careful) they soon become rusty; on 
that account, for beating whites they are 
objectionable. 

In cake-making, but few utensils are re* 
quired, other than those used in every fam- 
ily. Deep earthen pans are best for mixing 
cake in, and should be kept exclusively for 
that purpose, and as soon as done with, 
well washed, scalded, and kept in a dry 
place until again needed. 

A large spoon or spaddle, made of hard 
wood, with a handle from fourteen to eighteen 
inches in length, is best for beating a large 
quantity of batter; fogr a few pounds a 
smaller one will answer. 

Never use the hand alone, for beating 
batter of any kind; the warmth oils the 
butter, makes the cake less light, and con- 
sequently unhealthy

pudding, see that all the ingredients required 
are ready and at hand: the butter and 
sugar in the pan, eggs broken, flour weighed, 
and all other materials needed, ready for 
use. By so doing the cake or pudding may 
be made in a very short time, and with much 
less difficulty. 

The lightness of a cake, or goodness of a 
pudding, depends not only upon the making, 
but the well baking also. It matters not 
how superior the ingredients, or good the 
receipt by which cake is made, if it is 
not well baked. Therefore it is highly im- 
portant to exercise judgment respecting 
heat, which must be regulated according 
to the kind of cake to be baked. Pound 
cake requires heat sufficient to cause it 
to rise, and brown nicely, without scorching 
in the least; and so continue until done. 
The best rule to judge of this, is by the 
equal firmness all over the top, the same in 
the centre as at the sides, without bdng 
dried or overdone.

This quantity is sufficient for three small 
loaves, which are much better than larger 
ones. When the weather is cold, a small 
quantity of Indian mush may be added to 
either wheat or rye bread. It is thought to 
be (by many persons) a very great improve-
