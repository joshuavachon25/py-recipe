PREFACE TO THE THIETEEXTH EDITIOX 

This work has been revised wherever necessary to incorpo- 
rate the latest results of research in dietetics and embraces all 
the latest diets of leading physicians and hospitals. 

PEEFACE TO THE ELEVEXTH EDITIOX 

The continuous demand for this work since its last complete 
revision in 1910 has resulted in the publication of successive 
editions almost annually until the time became ripe for an- 
other complete revision. The present edition, while preserv- 
ing as far as possible the original plan of the work, incor- 
porates a large amount of new material in harmony with the 
latest developments in the science and art of dietetics. Many 
sections on the treatment of the sick have been entirely rewrit- 
ten to conform with present hospital practice. 

The author takes this opportunity to acknowledge with 
thanks the valuable advice and assistance given by Mary 
Swartz Eose, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Department of X'u- 
trition. Teachers' College, Columbia Universitv, Xew York 
City. 

For suggestions and permission to use certain diets the au- 
thor wishes to express her hearty appreciation to :

PEEFACE TO THE SIXTH EDITIOX 

The very gratifjdng demand for this work has necessitated 
the preparation of a sixth edition. Advantage has been 
taken of this opportunity to revise the book and incorporate, 
as far as space allows, the latest results of research in die- 
tetics. To meet the growing tendency of physicians to pre- 
scribe the exact fuel value of a diet, the total energy value 
of each recipe has been calculated wherever data as to com- 
position of materials used are available, or the quantities 
of materials used are fairly constant. A table has also been 
introduced in which the food value of the materials used in 
the recipes is given. This will be useful in computing other 
food combinations, and in calculating the amount of protein, 
fat or carbohydrates in any dietary, whenever required, with- 
out the tedious mathematical processes usually involved in 
such operations. 

It is hoped that a revised classification of food principles, 
greater emphasis on the value of mineral matter in the diet, 
and fuller discussion of the fundamental principles of nutri- 
tion, will add much to the usefulness of the book. 

In the introduction are presented outlines showing the re- 
quirements in dietetics of the various State Boards of Ex- 
aminers of Xurses, and the contents of the book have been 
rearranged to correspond directly with these requirements. 
This will materially aid the dietitian in arranging the course 
of study for the nurse so as to prepare her adequately for her 
State Examinations. 

Many years of experience as an instructor in dietetics in 
hospitals seem to the author to demonstrate that the "recipe 
book," so-called, should not be separate from the volume 
on "theory." Both theoretical and practical work should be 



X PREFACE 

treated together, otherwise, while the subjects are naturally 
closely allied, the young student becomes confused and is not 
apt to apply the theory to the practice. In this book she 
cannot read a recipe without having her attention called to 
its function in nutrition. Furthermore, for convenience 
sake, the two should be combined in one book of moderate 
size. One hundred and fifty pages have been added to this 
edition with but little increase in bulk. 

I take pleasure in acknowledging the valuable assistance 
rendered by Dr. Mary D. Swartz Eose, Assistant Professor 
of Household Arts, Teachers College, Columbia University, 
New York, in the preparation of this edition; also again to 
express my thanks for valuable material used in the book to 
Mrs. Ellen H. Eichards, Dr. W. Gihnan Thompson, Dr. Max 
Einhorn, Dr. Henry Koplik, Dr. L. Emmett Holt, Dr. Louis 
Starr, Dr. Frederick C. Shattuck, Dr. Elbridge G. Cutler, Dr. 
Elliott P. Joslin, Dr. Harry W. Goodall and Dr. Mavnard 
Ladd.

EXTBACT FbOM PkEFACE TO FiFTH EdITIOX 

I have been particularly pleased to see " Practical Dietet- 
ics " accepted as a text-book by so many educational and other 
authorities. Thus it is to be found in all hospitals of the 
United States Army; it has been recommended for use by all 
the various State Boards of Examiners of Nurses that have 
thus far been appointed; it has been adopted by the military 
authorities in Canada for the Permanent Schools of Instruc- 
tion for the Militia, and it has also been added to the Author- 
ized Text Book list of the New York City and Boston Public 
Schools. 

New York, November, 1908. 



PKEFACE TO THE SECOND EDITIOX 

The very cordial reception of the first edition of Practical 
Dietetics has encouraged a second presentation. 

In the preparation of the second issue the original matter 
has been thoroughly revised, and important additions made.

physicians, hospitals and publishers, and gratefully acknowl- 
edge their assistance and kind permission accorded by them

PEEFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 

As instructor of dietetics at various hospitals I have con- 
stantly felt the need of a simple manual and text-book for 
the use of the nurse in the classroom. 

None could be found which fulfilled the requirements as 
to simplicity, brevity, and exactness, with reference to dietetic 
treatment in disease. 

This same need has been expressed by mothers and nurses 
outside of the hospital. 

In the following pages I have endeavored to meet this 
need by giving the result of knowledge gained during the 
past eight years of practical classwork experience in hospitals 
of different cities. 

The preparation of food is a science as well as an art, the 
chemistry of which is as precise as the chemistry of the 
laboratory, "When we are willing to be as exact and care- 
ful in this work as we are in chemical experiments, our suc- 
cess will become a certainty. Xo other technical art can, with 
so little practical knowledge, go as far in simplifying that 
which is otherwise complicated and laborious, or do more 
toward accomplishing that which is a chief result of all 
science — adding to the comfort and happiness of the human 
race.

INTRODUCTION 

In response to the many requests of Superintendents of 
Training Schools and Dietitians for an outline of the various 
State Board Eequirements in Dietetics, I quote with permis- 
sion the given outlines and courses of study in dietetics as 
arranged by the American Hospital Association, and the va- 
rious State Boards of Examiners of Nurses. These questions 
I have printed as a Supplement to Pattee's " Practical Die- 
tetics " and a copy is given complimentary with each " Prac- 
tical Dietetics " purchased. Answers to all questions are to 
be found in this book. Eequirements of other States will be 
added to this Supplement as each new edition of Pattee's 
" Practical Dietetics " is issued. 

These outlines will prove of assistance to the Superintend- 
ent and Dietitian in arranging the course of study for the 
nurse, and will also prove suggestive to the nurse in prepar- 
ing for her State Examinations. 

Through the kindness of the various State Boards of Ex- 
aminers of Nurses I am also able to quote the examination 
questions of various States in this Supplement. 

If this Supplement (or separate booklet) is not received 
when copy of "Practical Dietetics" (13th ed.) is purchased 
notify the bookdealer who filled your order and he should 
give you a copy gratis. If he does not have one on hand and 
did not receive same with his order he should take up the 
matter with the firm from whom he ordered the books.

PRACTICAL DIETETICS 



CHAPTER I 

FOOD 

Functions of Food 

The human body may be compared to a machine which is 
capable of transforming energy supplied in the form of fuel 
into other forms of energy, i.e., muscular work and heat. As 
th€ automobile engine burns gasoline for fuel so the human 
engine burns food. 

Any machine in use is constantly wearing out, requiring the 
renewal of parts. In the body material for building new 
tissue and repairing worn out tissue is furnished by food. 

Abundance of fuel and new parts are not all that is neces- 
sary for the running of an engine. Without the proper lubri- 
cants the machine can not work. Oil serves this purpose for 
the automobile. The lubricants which insure the smooth 
working of all parts of the human engine, which " regulate 
the body processes " are supplied by food. 

Thus the chief functions of food are : 

(1) to yield energy 

(2) to build body substance 

(3) to regulate body processes 

Definition of Food. Foods are substances which when 
taken into the body supply the necessary elements for promot- 
ing its growth and replacing its waste, yield energy for mus- 
cular work and heat and regulate the body processes.

Definition. Carbohydrates are foodstuffs which contain 
carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen and oxygen are 



CLASSIFICATION OF FOOD 



usually present in the same proportions as in the water mole- 
cule, (HjO). These compounds have therefore been named 
carbo-hydrates. The term "carbohydrates" covers all sim- 
ple sugars and all substances which can be converted into 
simple sugars by hydrolysis. 

Source. Carbohydrates come from the vegetable kingdom 
almost entirely. There are a few exceptions such as glyco- 
gen and milk sugar. They form the chief constituent of 
roots, tubers and seeds. Important sources of carbohydrates 
for human use are cereals, potatoes, rice, tapioca, sago, sugar 
(cane, beet and maple), honey and sweet fruits. 

Classification. Carbohydrates include the monosaccharides 
such as dextrose or grape sugar, the disaccharides like sucrose 
or cane sugar, and the polysaccharides such as starch, dextrin 
and slycogen. (Glycogen is sometimes called animal starch). 

The term " monosaccharide " means that the sugar molecule 
contains only one sugar group or molecule. All such are 
called "simple sugars." The structure of the monosaccha- 
rides is represented by the formula CeH^^Oe. The " disaccha- 
rides " are sugars which on hydrolysis by enzymes or by boil- 
ing with dilute acids split to two molecules of simple sugar. 
Their chemical formula is CioHjjOn and their relation to the 
monosaccharides is shown thus : 

C.H^Ai + H^O >CeH,A + CeH.^Oe 

The " polysaccharides " are complex molecules which can be 
broken down into many molecules of simple sugar. Their 
formula is (CgHioOs),.

6 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Function. Carbohydrates when burned in the body jdeld 
energy in the form of work or heat. Carbohydrate in excess 
of the body's immediate needs for fuel is stored as glycogen, 
chiefly in the liver but also in the muscles and other organs. 
The body's capacity to store glycogen is limited and if more 
carbohydrate is eaten the surplus is changed into fat. 

Sugars 

Sugars are soluble carbohydrates with a more or less sweet 
taste. When heated to a high temperature they form cara- 
mel. Dietetics is especially concerned with grape sugar 
(glucose or dextrose), milk sugar (lactose) and cane sugar 
(sucrose). 

DEXTBOSE (OB GLUCOSE) 

Description. Dextrose occurs in nature as a syrup. It 
is much less sweet than cane sugar. Other sugars have to be 
changed to this form before the body can use them. 

Source. It is found throughout the vegetable kingdom, 
chiefly in fruit and plant juices. It is especially abundant 
in grapes, of which it often constitutes 20 per cent or more 
of the weight of the fresh fruit and considerably more than 
half of the solid matter. Commercially it is made from 
starch by hydrolysis with acids. 

Use in the Diet. Dextrose is a fuel food in a very readily 
absorbed form. Taken in large quantities it is liable to fer- 
ment or flood the system with sugar too rapidly, but as nat- 
urally present in sweet fruits or in its artificial form in small 
quantities along with other foodstuifs it is a very economical 
source of energy. Being less sweet than cane sugar, when 
it is used to sweeten other foods a larger amount must be 
taken. 

LACTOSE 

Lactose (milk sugar) occurs in the milk of all mammals. 
It is less sweet and much less soluble than cane sugar and 
does not readily ferment. Because of its mild flavor and be- 



CARBOHYDRATES 7 

cause it is less irritating to the digestive tract than sucrose it 
is widely used in feeding infants and invalids where it is 
a valuable source of fuel. 

SUCBOSE 

Description. Pure cane sugar is chemically the same as 
beet sugar. Maple sugar would not be different from ordi- 
narv sugar if it were sufficiently purified to remove the fla- 
voring matter. By boiling for a long time or in the presence 
of acids (whether naturally in the fruit or added to it) cane 
sugar is changed to invert sugar which is a mixture of equal 
parts of dextrose and levulose. While dextrose is not as 
sweet as cane sugar, levulose is very much sweeter, so that 
the mixture has a peculiar penetrating sweetness that is not 
as well liked as the cane sugar flavor. 

Source. Sucrose is found in the sap or juices of a variety 
of plants, the sugar cane, the sugar beet and the sugar maple 
being the most important sources commercially, but many 
common fruits and vegetables contain considerable amounts. 
WTiether obtained by collecting sap or by crushing, it is al- 
ways at first a syrup and all solid sugar is made from these 
juices by the process of refining. 

Use in the Diet. Cane sugar constitutes a very important 
part of the dietary of most people for table use and in confec- 
tionery and in combination with other foods in cooking. It 
is a valuable source of energy but must be used with dis- 
cretion because in too large amounts or in too concentrated a 
form it is irritating to the membrane of the stomach, is liable 
to ferment, and also because being quickly absorbed, it sat- 
isfies the appetite before the need for food has been entirely 
met or blunts it so that other foods become distasteful. 
Sweet fruits are better than pure sugar, especially for children, 
since fruits contain important mineral salts which are wholly 
lacking in sugar. 

Sugar should be avoided in gastric disorders, and in dia- 
betes, and because it is a very concentrated food it should 
not be used in cases of obesity. 



8 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Substitute for Sugar. Since sugar is used not only as a 
fuel food but as a condiment, attempts have been made to 
secure a substitute for use in cases where carbohydrate is 
limited or denied. The best known of these is " saccharin " 
or " sweetina," a crystalline coal tar product. It is many 
times sweeter than sugar but it has no food value. 

Tests for Sugar. A simple test for sugars, in general, con- 
sists in adding an equal volume of concentrated sodium hy- 
droxide solution to the suspected solution, and boiling. A 
brown color indicates the presence of sugar. 

The chief test for dextrose is Fehling's. A test solution 
should be on hand and may be obtained at any apothecary's. 
It should be fresh. The test is based on the fact that dex- 
trose " reduces *' salts of copper, i. e., by depriving them of 
some of their oxygen and an insoluble oxide of copper is pre- 
cipitated. To make the test, add to a portion of the test 
solution a few drops of the suspected solution in a test tube 
and boil. If a red precipitate forms, dextrose is present. 
The sole use of this test for the nurse will probably be in 
connection with diabetes, when the nurse makes the test at 
the request of the physician. 

Starch and Other Polysaccharides 

Description. Starch, unlike sugar, is insoluble but may be 
made to pass into a soluble form by boiling in water, dry 
heating at high temperature or by certain digestive ferments. 
The first substances formed in the course of starch digestion 
are dextrins; these can be split to the disaccharide maltose 
which in turn will yield two molecules of dextrose. The 
polysaccharides which have nutritive value in the body are 
starch, dextrins and glycogen. 

In its pure state, i. e., when isolated from proteins, cellu- 
lose, gums, and so forth, starch is a shining white powder 
having a distinctive quality to the touch. Under the micro- 
scope it is found to consist of granules which are insoluble in 



CARBOHYDRATES 9 

cold water; on warming they absorb water and swell. Cook- 
ing in water ruptures the starch grains, rendering the con- 
tents more readily acted upon by the digestive juices. 

Source. Starch occurs widely in the vegetable kingdom. 
It is found in largest amount in seeds, roots, tubers, buli).s 
and sometimes in the stems and leaves of plants. It con- 
stitutes one half to three fourths of the solid matter of 
the ordinar}' cereal grains and at least three fourths of the 
solids of mature potatoes. The commercial product " starch " 
is obtained from wheat, corn, rice, potatoes and arrowroot. 

Other Polysaccharides. Cellulose, the framework of plants, 
has no nutritive value, but because it is not digested in the 
human body it forms the major part of the ballast which 
is so necessary to a normal intestinal movement. It stimulates 
peristalsis by acting as a gentle mechanical irritant ; by 
helping to retain moisture and to keep the feces soft ; and by 
giving such bulk that the intestinal muscles can act to good 
advantage. Unless it is desirable for some special reason to 
relieve the digestive tract of all work a certain amount of 
cellulose should be included in the diet. In constipation the 
addition of an increased amount of cellulose in some non- 
irritating form, like agar-agar, has proved a successful thera- 
peutic measure. Much of our food as we eat it has had most 
of the cellulose naturally present removed in preparing it for 
the table. For this reason bran is frequently added to food 
by those having a tendency to sluggish intestinal movement. 
The same results can be secured by making the diet consist 
of a greater proportion of foods which contain large amounts 
of " roughage " or ballast, such as green vegetables, fruits 
and whole grain products. 

Gums have little or no nutritive value in the human body, 
and like cellulose act as ballast. 

Principles of Cooking Starch. The principles involved in 
the cooking of starch are of two types — chemical and me- 
chanical. 



10 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Chemical Principles. Since raw starch is digestible only 
to a slight degree, it is essential to good digestion that starchy 
foods be cooked. 

In the presence of moisture, starch becomes semi-soluble 
at the temperature of boiling water, i. e., 212 degrees Fahren- 
heit. Groiels are made by cooking cereal flours in water at 
or near the boiling temperature for a long time. 

By dry heat, at a temperature of 300-400 degrees Fahren- 
heit, starch can be converted to dextrin. This principle is 
applied in making toast, a little dextrin forming on the out- 
side of the slice. A small portion of the starch is further 
changed to caramel, giving a characteristic flavor to the crust 
of bread, toast, etc. 

Mechanical Principles. When foods composed largely of 
starch, such as flour, cornstarch, etc., are to be cooked with 
a liquid, care must be taken to prevent the formation of 
lumps, for these are not only unsightly, but consist of an 
outer layer of cooked starch surrounding a center of un- 
changed material and preventing its being made digestible. 

There are three methods of avoiding lumps: 

1. By mixing the starch gradually witli a small portion of 
cold water, so that a smooth paste is formed, before adding 
the boiling liquid. This method is used in making gruels, 
etc. 

2. By mixing with fat before adding liquid. The melting 
fat separates the starch granules. At least as much fat as 
starch must be used. The liquid is preferably added cold, 
and all at once. If added hot, it must be stirred in very 
gradually. This method is employed in making gravies, 
sauces, etc. 

3. By mixing with sugar. The melting sugar serves to 
separate the starch grains. This is practicable only when the 
sugar is greater in amount than the starch, and the liquid 
must be added gradually. This method is applied in the 
ease of desserts, such as cornstarch pudding. 

When foods consisting of a mixture of starch and cellu- 



FATS AND OILS 11 

lose, as cereal breakfast foods, are to be cooked, it is necessary 
to soften and break up the cellulose to enable the digestive 
juices to reach the starch. This necessitates long cooking 
at a temperature near the boiling point. The longer such a 
cereal food is cooked, the easier of digestion it becomes. 
Hence it is an excellent rule to cook such foods for infants 
and others of feeble digestive powers, twice as long as is com- 
monly recommended. 

Reheating of starchy foods, therefore, tends to promote 
their ease of digestion. Zwieback (twice baked bread) is 
more readily digested than fresh bread. :Moreover the texture 
of hard dry bread induces more thorough mastication than 
does the fresh which is apt to be swallowed in soft doughy 
lumps. 

Test for Starch. Starch is colored blue by iodine. Hence 
it is easy to detect its presence in any food. To make the 
test, a small portion of the material should be placed in a 
test tube, boiled with a little water, cooled, and two or three 
drops of dilute tincture of iodine added. If starch is pres- 
ent, the blue color Avill immediately appear. Dextrin gives 
a portwine color with iodine, so that if any of this substance be 
present, the color is modified, becoming more or less purplish, 
or purple-red. 

FATS AND OILS 

Definition. Fats are composed of carbon, hydrogen and 
oxygen but the oxygen is present in smaller proportion than 
in carbohydrates. Fats were formerly spoken of as hydro- 
carbons but this term is now reserved for substances whicli 
contain no oxygen at all, such as benzene. 

Description. True fats, whether solids or oils, are chemi- 
cally compounds of fatty acids with glycerol, called glycerido?. 
and differ among themselves according to the particular :fntt3/ 
acids they contain. Those commonly found in considerable 
amount in edible fats are stearic, palmitic and oleic acids. 
The stearates or combinations of stearic acid with glycerol 



12 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

(sometimes called stearins) are solid fats as are also palmi- 
tates or palmitins. The oleates or oleins, on the other hand, 
are liquid at ordinary temperatures. Butter, tallow, lard and 
other common fats are mixtures of glycerides. The softness 
of butter, oleomargarine, lard, etc., is due to the amount of 
olein which they contain. Suet and tallow owe their hard- 
ness largely to the amount of stearin present. Vegetable oils 
(olive, cottonseed, peanut, almond and cocoanut) contain 
large amounts of olein, as does also cod liver oil. Certain 
foods not usually thought of as fatty, contain significant 
amounts of fat, for example, egg yolk, Indian corn and nearly 
all nuts. 

Lecithin. Besides the true fats there are many fat-like 
substances, closely related to the fats both chemically and 
biologically, which occur widely in nature. One of the most 
important of these, from the standpoint of nutrition, is leci- 
thin which is found abundantly in egg yolk, and also in brain 
and nerve tissue, blood, lymph, milk, "many seeds and other 
plant and animal tissues. Besides fatty acids it contains 
phosphorus. It is a necessary constituent of every living cell. 
Volatile Oils. These have little in common with true oils. 
They vary much among themselves in composition but all tend 
to disappear by evaporation. They are characterized by their 
odors, tastes and pungency. A few of them are used as fla- 
voring. The oil of bergamot is obtained from a variety of 
orange, the oil of lemon from lemon peel, etc. Cooking tends 
to volatilize them, so that such flavoring should be added at 
the last moment. 

Source of Fat. The cliief sources of fat in the diet are 
milk (yielding cream and butter), olive oil and other vege- 
table oils, meat fats (especially lard, bacon, salt pork, beef 
suet and drippings), and nuts. 

Cheap Forms of Fat. There are cheaper forms of fat than 
butter, olive oil and lard. Among them are oleomargarine 
and the various margarines made from vegetable fats, such 
as cocoanut, cottonseed and corn oils. Because they are 



FATS AND OILS 13 

clicaper they are used as substitutes for the more expensive 
fats. Oleomargarine is made of beef fat churned with milk. 
Cottonseed, cocoanut and palm nut oils are also used in the 
manufacture of butter substitutes. Combinations of cot- 
tonseed oil and beef fat are made into fats similar in appear- 
ance and use to lard. The oils of corn, cottonseed and certain 
other seeds are now commonly used in place of olive oil. 

Oleomargarine and the other butter substitutes have prac- 
tically the same fuel value as butter. Olive oil, cottonseed 
and corn oils and lard are 100 per cent, fat and yield equal 
amounts of energy. Butter, however, and, to a less extent, 
beef fat, contain a growth-promoting substance, fat-soluble 
vitamine, not found in lard, olive oil or any vegetable fat 
or oil. Milk, egg yolk and green vegetables are rich sources 
of fat-soluble vitamine and when they are included in the diet 
in liberal amounts substitutes for butter may be safely used, 
but otherwise there is a danger of deficiency in this vitamine. 

Note: See discussion on Yitamines, page 21. 

Function. Fat is the most concentrated kind of fuel, fur- 
nishing two and one fourth times as much energy as the same 
weight of carbohydrate or protein. Excess of any of the or- 
ganic foodstuffs may be stored as reserve fuel in the form of 
body fat. To serve as an energy supply is its most impor- 
tant function ; but fat also serves as a protection to the body 
from mechanical injury and from too rapid loss of heat when 
exposed to cold, and as a packing and support to the visceral 
organs, particularly the kidneys. 

Digestibility. Fat tends to check the secretion of gastric 
juice and to retard the motility of the stomach, thereby les- 
sening the rate of digestion. The softer fats and emulsified 
fats are digested more quickly than those that are harder. 
Heating fats to too high a temperature in cooking may decom- 
pose them and produce substances irritating to the membrane 
of the stomach. Also, foods fried in fat are coated with 
and possibly permeated by it and thus are more slowly di- 
gested. 



14 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Tests for Fats. Fats are readily tested with paper ; if they 
are present in a given substance a permanent grease spot 
appears. If to a suspected substance a little sodium hydrox- 
ide solution is added a white precipitate forms, which is a 
hard sodium soap. 

PROTEINS 

Chemical Nature. Proteins are organic foodstuffs, com- 
pounds of the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, 
sulphur and sometimes phosphorus. Carboliydrates and fats 
contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, but proteins are the 
only source of organic nitrogen whicli is an essential con- 
stituent of both animal and plant cells. 

Proteins are made up of simpler substances containing ni- 
trogen, called amino acids. They bear the same relation to 
protein that dextrose does to starcli, tliat is, amino acids are 
the last step in the breaking down of the protein molecule 
in digestion, but, whereas all the molecules of dextrose which 
starch yields on hydrolysis are alike, one protein molecule 
may yield from 12 to 20 different amino acids. 

Source. Proteins are an important part of muscle tissue 
and of both animal and plant protoplasm. Plants can build 
their own proteins from inorganic materials which they derive 
from the soil and the air, but animals are unable to synthe- 
size their body proteins directly from inorganic substances 
and must get them from the proteins in their food. 

Man secures his protein from two sources, animal and 
vegetable foods. Meat, fish, eggs and milk furnish large 
amounts of animal proteins. Egg proteins are found in both 
the whites and the yolks. Milk has two very important pro- 
teins, casein and lactalbumin. Animal foods are, in general, 
richer in protein than vegetable foods. The only foods of 
plant origin wliich can compare with animal foods in this re- 
spect are the legumes (peas, beans, lentils, peanuts, etc.), 
and certain nuts, such as almonds and pine nuts. 

Classification. Proteins are usually classified as simple 



PROTEINS 15 

proteins, conjugated proteins and derived proteins. Some 
examples of proteins of each group are given below and the 
reader is referred to Sherman's Chemistry of Food and Nu- 
trition, Second Edition, pages 51-54 for the complete clas- 
sification. 

1. Simple Proteins. 

(a) Albumins. Examples: egg albumin (egg white), 
lactalbumin (milk), serum albumin (blood). 

(b) Globulins. Examples: muscle globulin, serum 
globulin (blood), edestin (wheat, hemp seed and 
other seeds), legumin (beans and peas ). 

(c) Albuminoids. Examples: collagen of connective 
tissue. 

2. Conjugated Proteins. 

(a) Xucleoproteins. Examples: proteins of glandu- 
lar organs, such as sweetbreads. 

(b) Phosphoproteins. Examples: casein (milk), 
ovovitellin (egg yolk). 

(c) Hemoglobins. Examples: hemoglobin of blood. 

3. Derived Proteins. 

(a) Metaproteins. Examples: acid proteins, alkali 

proteins, albuminates. 

(b) Proteoses. 

(c) Peptones. 

Nitrogenous Extractives. Xot all the nitrogen present in 
food is in the form of protein. Substances found in mus- 
cle juice, consisting chiefly of creatin, creatinin and purins 
(uric acid and related substances), have little if any fuel 
value and are useful only as stimulants. They give meats 
their characteristic flavor and hence are appetizing and stimu- 
late the flow of gastric juice. For this reason, extracts of 
meat, such as beef tea, beef juice and soups made from meat 
stock are valuable in feeding the sick. 

Functions. Proteins have two functions: (1) to yield 
energy, and (2) to build tissue. The body is constantly losing 
nitrogen, as a waste product from the metabolism of the cells 



IG PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

and from the wear and tear of the cell structure. The nitro- 
gen to make up for this loss must be supplied by protein 
food. 

Differences in Value in Nutrition. There are marked dif- 
ferences in the value of the different proteins in respect to 
their ability to form body substance and these variations are 
due to the amino acids which they contain. Experiments 
with animals, in which the diet contained only one protein, 
show that gliadin (one of the proteins of wheat) will maintain 
a full grown animal in body weight but will not promote 
growth in the young, while zein (one of the proteins of the 
corn kernel) is inadequate for both maintenance and growth, 
(xliadin lacks lysine, an amino acid essential to growth, but 
it is sufficient for maintenance because it contains the amino 
acid tryptophane. Zein lacks both lysine and tryptophane. 
Casein and lactalbumin (milk), ovalbumin and ovovitellin 
(eggs) and edestin (grains) are examples of what are called 
" complete proteins " because they contain all the amino acids 
necessary for both maintenance and growth. Proteins capa- 
ble of maintaining life but not of promoting normal growth 
are termed " partially incomplete." Gliadin is one of these. 
" Incomplete proteins " are those incapable of maintaining 
life or promoting growth. Zein and gelatin are examples 
of this class. 

The amino acids lacking in certain proteins are supplied 
by a mixed diet containing more than one kind of protein, and, 
in the case of certain grains such as corn, the deficiency in 
one kind is corrected more or less by the other proteins of the 
whole grain ; for example, glutelin, another protein of the 
corn kernel, which is " complete," supplies the tryptophane 
and lysine lacking in zein. In order to be certain that the 
diet contains an adequate supply of complete proteins, the 
liberal use of milk, eggs and vegetables is important, espe- 
cially for growing children and invalids. 

Coohing of Protein. Care is necessary in the cooking of 
protein in order to prevent toughening and to make it easy 



MINERAL MATTER 17 

of digestion. The following experiment with egg albumin, 
which is one of the most familiar proteins, illustrates some 
of the properties of proteins in general. 

Effect of Temperature on Protein. Put some white of egg 
into a test tube, place in a sauce pan of cold water, heat grad- 
ually, and observe all changes. 

1. Raw egg white is a stick)^ clear, pale straw-colored liquid. 
It is not well digested. 

2. When the water reaches the temperature of 134° F. 
wliite streaks will be seen in a semi-solid substance. 

3. When the water reaches the temperature of 150° to 
160° F. the egg white will be soft and jelly-like in consistency, 
and is readily digested. 

4. When the water reaches 212° F. the egg white will be 
tough white jelly and less readily digested. 

5. When egg white is heated to 300° F. or higher (for 
example by putting the test tube directly over the flame), it 
will almost immediately become hard and tough. 

These tests show that protein is hardened and toughened 
by high temperatures ; it is most tender and readily digested 
when cooked at a low temperature. 

MINERAL MATTER 

(Amount and Kind in the Body. The mineral matter in 
the body amounts to about 5 or 6 per cent by weight, occurring 
chiefly in the bones but also in the tissues and in blood and 
other body fluids. 

The body is composed of the elements oxygen, carbon, hydro- 
gen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulphur, so- 
dium, chlorine, magnesium and iron, with minute traces of 
iodine, fluorine and silicon. Of these oxygen, carbon, hydro- 
gen, nitrogen, sulphur and some phosphorus exist in the body 
in proteins. Phosphorus is also combined with calcium in the 
form of calcium phosphate which is the chief mineral constitu- 
ent of bone. Magnesium also occurs in bone. Calcium and 
magnesium and some phosphorus are found in muscle tissue. 



18 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

The blood and other body fluids contain calcium, sodium,, 
chlorine (chiefly as sodium chloride), magnesium, phosphorus 
and potassium. Blood is especially rich in iron which is found 
in the hemoglobin of the red corpuscles. 

Occurrence in Food. All the elements which enter into the 
structure of the body must be furnished by the food. Carbon, 
hydrogen and oxygen are supplied by the proteins, fats and 
carbohydrates; nitrogen and sulphur by the proteins. Phos- 
phorus is combined with some proteins (phosphoproteins), 
some fats (phosphorized fats) and some carbohydrates, and 
it also occurs in inorganic form, for the most part as calcium 
phosphate. Among the phosphorus-rich foods arc milk, egg 
yolk, legumes, whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables and 
lean meat. 

Foods rich in calcium are milk (by far the best source, 
both because it is the richest in calcium of any of the common 
foods and because of the ease with which its calcium is as- 
similated), cheese, whole grains, legumes, vegetables, fruits 
and molasses. 

Egg yolk and spinach are especially good sources of iron, 
but green vegetables in general, legumes, potatoes, whohi 
grain products and fruits are fairly rich sources. ^lilk 
contains iron in rather small amount, but in a form very 
easy to digest and assimilate, and is, therefore, a more valu- 
able source than its iron content would indicate. Lean meat 
is richer in iron but in a form less available to the body. 

Sodium and chlorine, as sodium chloride or common salt, 
is added to food as seasoning in such quantities that the needs 
of the body for these elements are amply met. 

Potassium and magnesium are so widely distributed in 
foods, and such small amounts are needed by the body that 
they are adequately supplied by a mixed diet. 

Calcium, iron and phosphorus are of such importance in 
nutrition and, calcium and iron especially, so often inade- 
quately supplied by the diet, that they demand special atten- 
tion to insure the inclusion in the diet in sufficiently large 



WATER 19 

amounts foods rich in these three elements. Milk, vegetables, 
eggs and fruits, if used liberally, will furnish enough of 
these ash constituents to meet the body's requirement. 

Functions. Mineral matter functions in the body in the 

following ways : 

1(1) As a constituent of the bones, giving rigidity and 
relative permanence to the skeletal tissues. 

(2) As essential elements in the structure of the soft 
tissues (muscles, blood cells, etc.). 

(3) As soluble salts held in solution in the fluids of the 
body, giving these fluids their characteristic influence upon 
the elasticity and irritability of muscle and nerve, supplying 
the material for the acidity or alkalinity of the digestive 
juices and other secretions, and yet maintaining the neutral- 
ity or slight alkalescence of the internal fluids as well as their 
osmotic pressure and solvent power. 

WATER 

Composition and Properties. Water is composed of the 
elements hydrogen and oxygen, two parts of hydrogen to one 
of oxygen. Its chemical formula is written H2O. Abso- 
lutely'pure water is colorless, odorless and tasteless, but such 
water is not found in nature, owing to its great solvent power, 
which causes it to dissolve substances with which it comes 
in contact. Water ordinarily, therefore, contains varying 
quantities of mineral and organic matter, including gases. 
To these substances in solution the characteristic flavor is 
due. Water from which the air has been expelled by boiling 
or long standing in a warm place has a " flat " taste. 

Water freezes at 32° F. On heating, the ice melts, and 
we may have ice water with a temperature of 32° F. When 
this water is warmed, the air dissolved in it begins to expand, 
and tiny bubbles appear, forming first on the sides of the 
vessel, and tending to rise to the surface. If the water there 
is not yet warmed, they contract and sink, but finally when 

1 Quoted from Sherman, " Chemistry of Food and Nutrition," Second Edi- 
tion. i>age 236. 



20 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

the water is warm throughout, come to the surface and es- 
cape. After the air is thus expelled, if heating is continued, 
steam bubbles form in a similar manner. At 185° F., water 
bubbles below the surface, or sinijners. When the bubbles 
reach the surface and break, giving off a cloud of steam, the 
boiling point 212° F, has been reached. Except under pres- 
sure, water can then become no hotter. Fast boiling simply 
means rapid evaporations and waste of fuel. 

Water Content of Foods. The water content of foods varies 
widely. In green vegetables it constitutes from 85 to 95 per 
cent, of the whole substance; in potatoes and some other 
starchy vegetables it is present in as large amount as 75 per 
cent. Even in seemingly dry foods like crackers there may 
be as much as from 5 to 10 per cent. But since the body 
itself contains a large amount of water and the water loss 
through the lungs, skin, kidneys, etc., is so great, water must 
be taken in addition to that contained in food. Under or- 
dinary circumstances about 3 to 4 pints daily are necessary. 
The quantity of water excreted per day varies with atmos- 
pheric conditions and the amount of exercise, increasing with 
hot weather and violent exercise and decreasing in the bed- 
ridden and sedentary. Babies and delirious patients should 
be fed water as carefully as food. The liberal drinking of 
water with meals promotes good digestion, provided that it 
is not too cold and that it is not used to wash down food. 

Functions. Water serves the following important pur- 
poses in the body: 

(1) It is an essential constituent of the tissue cells and of

VITAMiyES 21 

VITAMINES 

Tliere are three substances or groups of substances, not yet 
chemically identified, which are necessary to normal growth 
and maintenance. A diet may be adequate in amount and 
kind of fuel, protein, ash constituents and water and still 
fail to promote normal growth or maintain an animal in 
health if one or all of these substances is lacking. They are 
variously known as vitaniines, accessory food substances, and 
food hormones. 

One of them is soluble in fat and is found naturally in 
such fats as butter, cod liver oil, fat of egg yolk and of glandu- 
lar organs such as the kidney, but is not found in lard or in 
olive oil or any other fat or oil of vegetable origin. It is, 
liowever, found in the leaves of plants. The absence of this 
vitamine in the diets of growing animals results in retarded 
growth which is resumed when a food containing this growth- 
promoting fat is added. Full grown animals do not show a 
lack of the fat-soluble vitamine as quickly as do growing 
animals, but eventually they give evidence of impaired health 
and nutrition which disappears on the addition of this essen- 
tial food factor. The best sources of fat-soluble vitamine 
are whole milk, butter, egg yolk and the leafy vegetables. 

The second vitamine is soluble in water and insoluble in 
fat. Lack of it causes a disease known as beriberi which 
manifests itself as a degeneration of the nerves, and which 
occurs among people living too largely on a diet of polished 
rice. It can be prevented or cured by using unpolished rice 
instead of polished or white rice, or by adding to the diet beans, 
peas, peanuts or whole grains. The water-soluble vitamine 
is more widely distributed in natural foods than the fat-soluble 
and there is much less danger of a deficiency in this respect 
than of the fat-soluble vitamine, provided that the food is not 
too highly refined. Foods rich in this substance are milk, 
egg yolk, legumes, the bran and germ of whole grains and 
green vegetables. 



22 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

The third vitamine gives to certain foods their 
Antiscorbutic Property 

The occurrence of scurvy has been found to be coincident 
with a diet consisting largely of dried and cooked foods; it 
is cured by the use of fresh foods, such as oranges, lemons, 
limes, potatoes, cabbage and tomatoes, in particular, and fresh 
fruits and vegetables, in general. Cooked and canned fruits 
do not appear to have lost much of their " antiscorbutic prop- 
erty," but the ordinary cooking of vegetables has variable re- 
sults, usually resulting in some loss, and sometimes in com- 
plete loss. Cabbage, potatoes and tomatoes stand heating verv 
well. The heating of milk injures the antiscorbutic prop- 
erty, and the use of pasteurized or boiled milk or proprietary 
foods in feeding infants frequently results in the develop- 
ment of infantile scurvy unless raw milk is substituted or 
fresh fruit or vegetable juice is added. Orange juice is most 
commonly used, but potato water as a diluent for milk instead 
of barley water is now recommended (Hess and Fish), and 
recent work is reported (Hess) in wliich canned tomato juice 
was successfully used as a substitute for orange juice, even 
with very young children. 

The animal body can not manufacture vitamines; it can 
only gather them from its food. If the diet is deficient in 
any one of these necessary substances, satisfactory nutrition is 
impossible. 

THE ESSENTIALS OF AN ADEQUATE DIET 

The Essentials of an Adequate Diet may be summarized as : 

(1) Sufficient material to yield the necessary energy; 

(2) Sufficient protein of the kind best suited to growth and 
maintenance ; 

(3) Adequate amounts of ash constituents in the proper 
proportions ; 

(4) An adequate supply of vitaniinos. 

A Perfect Food. 1. "A perfect food must contain all the 



FOOD ACCESSORIES OR ADJUNCTS 23 

nutritive elements of the body : Proteins, carbohydrates, fats, 
mineral matter, water and vitamines. 

2. It must contain these in their proper proportions. 

3, It must contain in a moderate compass the total amount 
required daily. 

■i. The nutritive elements must be capable of easy absorp- 
tion, and yet leave a certain bulk of un absorbed matter to 
act as intestinal ballast. It must be obtainable at a mod- 
erate cost. — Hutchinson. 

A Mixed Diet therefore is necessary, as no " one food " 
fulfills all the requirements of a " perfect food." A mixed 
diet must be taken whereby one food may be used to sup- 
plement what is lacking in another. The foods best for 
health are those best fitted to the needs of the individual. 
The cheapest food is that which furnishes the largest amount 
of nutriment at the least cost. The best food is that which 
is both healthful and cheapest. 

Dietetics is an application of the science of nutrition to the 
feeding of individuals of different ages, under different cir- 
cumstances, in health and disease. 



FOOD ACCESSORIES OE ADJUNCTS 

CONDIMENTS — BEVERAGES 

Definition. Food accessories or food adjuncts are sub- 
stances which, althougli they have no nutritive value, are 
extensively used in the dietary to give flavor to foods, to in- 
crease the appetite and to furnish pleasing variety. Under 
the term are included condiments and beverages. 

Condiments 

The number of condiments, if we consider appetizing sub- 
stances of all kinds, is very large. It includes the great 
variety of sauces, spices used in cooking (ginger, cinnamon. 



24 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

nutmeg and cloves), flavoring extracts (vanilla, oil of lemou, 
etc.), mustard, horseradish, pepper, salt and vinegar. Of 
these, salt is, strictly speaking, a food. When it is used in 
excess of body needs, simply to modify the flavor of food, it is 
properly classed as a condiment. 

The taste for condiments is largely an artificial one and 
their use should be limited. In moderation, for the sake of 
variety, or when the appetite is feeble, their addition to the 
diet is legitimate. They should be withheld (with the excep- 
tion of salt) from the food of children, because they destroy 
the appetite for milder foods and because they are irritating 
to the mucous membrane of the alimentary canal. For the 
same reason, they should also be given with caution to in- 
valids, especially those suffering from any inflammation of 
the digestive tract. 

Beverages 

These food accessories include tea, coffee, alcoholic drinks, 
lemonade and other acid drinks, aerated and carbonated 
drinks. Sucli beverages are useful, not because of their nu- 
tritive value, for they have little or none, but because of 
their stimulating or thirst quenching qualities, and because 
of an attractive flavor. 

Milk, cocoa and chocolate, though taken as beverages with 
meals, are really foods, since they contain protein, fat, car- 
bohydrate and mineral matter. 



CHAPTER II 
NUTRITION 

DIGESTION — ABSORPTION — METABOLISM 

Under this term is usually understood the digestion and 
absorption of nourishment, its assimilation and utilization, 
its storage in excess, and finally the elimination of the 
products of wear and tear, of combu^ion, and of nutriment 
or waste which cannot be utilized. Those processes of nutri- 
tion which occur after absorption are now included in the 
term metabolism. To restate this in a simple form (adapted 
from Thompson), nutrition involves: 

1. The secretion of digestive fluids, and their action upon 
food in the alimentary canal — in other words, digestion. ^ 

2. The passage of the ingredients of the digested food into 
the blood vessels and lymphathic vessels — absorption. 

3. The utilization of the absorbed nutrition products by 
the cells — assimilation or upward metabolism. 

4. The elimination of waste material — disassimilation or 
downward metabolism. 

The subjects of digestion and absorption will be treated in 
detail for each food principle, and then summarized at the 
end of each topic. 

DIGESTION 

DIGESTION OF PROTEINS 

Digestion in the Stomach, Protein is not chemically al- 
tered in the mouth. The process of chewing simply mois- 
tens and divides it into small particles so that it is easily 
swallowed and more readily attacked by the secretion of the 
stomach. Passing down the oesophagus, through the cardiac 

25 



26 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

sphincter guarding the entrance to the stomach, it enters that 
portion of the latter organ called the fundus. Here it rests 
quietly for some time, so that it is not immediately mixed 
with gastric juice, as formerly taught, but the outer portions 
of the mass are successively attacked and dissolved. These 
soft portions are then pressed into the intermediate and 
pyloric regions of the stomach and subjected to a thorough 
mixing. 

The gastric juice is an acid fluid which may be secreted in 
large quantities — as much as one or two gallons in 24 hours. 
Its acidity is due to the presence of about 0.2 per cent, to 0.4 
per cent, of hydrochloric acid. This of itself is capable; of 
causing protein to swell and to some extent dissolve/ of 
hydrolyzing the collagen of connective tissue; of decalcifying 
bone ; and of preventing bacterial action. 

The gastric juice contains two enzymes which act on pro- 
tein, pepsin and rennin. Pepsin can act only in the presence 
of a definite percentage of hydrochloric acid, while rennin 
acts in a neutral solution. The relations of rennin and pep- 
sin are not yet very clearly understood. The function of 
rennin is to curdle milk, which causes it to remain in the 
stomach long enough to be digested by the pepsin. 

Action of Pepsin, The protein of the diet, more or less 
swollen, softened, and dissolved by the action of hydrochloric 
acid, is changed chemically by pepsin, into a series of in- 
creasingly simpler and more soluble products, namely, acid 
proteins, proteoses (often called albumoses) and peptones. 
The change to peptones is not complete, but these three 
products of peptic digestion tend to pass together into the 
intestine, when the pyloric sphincter which guards the en- 
trance to the duodenum opens to let them pass. The opening 
and closing of this sphincter is controlled by two factors': 
1. The consistency of the partly digested food, solid particles 
tending to keep the pylorus closed. 2. The presence of free 
hydrochloric acid in the stomach contents. This is the more 
important factor. 

Protein is capable of absorbing and uniting chemically with 



DIGEST 10 S '^'i 

a certain amount of acid. When it is so saturated, free acid 
will be present, having now nothing with which to combine, 
and this free acid is the stimulus which causes the pyloric 
sphincter to relax and lets a little spurt of food into the 
duodenum. Once in the duodenum, this same acid acts as 
the stimulus to close the pylorus, and no more food enters the 
duodenum until the first portion has been neutralized. 

A clear understanding of the way in which the pyloric 
sphincter is regulated throws considerable light on stomach 
digestion. We can understand why a certain quantity of in- 
digestible residue, such as is present in most of our staple 
foods — meats, vegetables, fruits, etc. — is of service in re- 
taining food within the stomach for a time, giving the 
hydrochloric acid a chance to exercise its bactericidal power, 
and favoring thorough gastric digestion. It also explains 
why a meal of " bolted " food (or of food imperfectly masti- 
cated through absence of teeth), or a failure of free hydro- 
chloric acid in the stomach contents, as in hypoacidity or 
achylia gastrica, may set up such a continuous state of pyloric 
contraction that the stomach remains unemptied for a long 
period, with a good prospect of fermentation and gas pro- 
duction, of relief by vomiting, or of an attack of acute in- 
digestion, biliousness or diarrhoea. The nurse will under- 
stand why a diet of "liquids" for a person in relatively 
good health does not prove satisfactory. Liquids do not stay 
long enough in the stomach to give a sense of fullness, give 
the stomach little to do, and tend to pass into the intestine 
poorly prepared for the action of the digestive juices there. 

Digestion in the Intestines. On entering the duodenum, 
the acid chyme from the stomach meets three secretions, all 
alkaline in reaction, namely, the pancreatic juice, the bile, 
and the intestinal juice. 

The hydrochloric acid of the stomach is indirectly respon- 
sible for the flow of the pancreatic juice, for this begins only 
after acid food has entered the duodenum. The pancreatic 
juice contains an enz3Tne capable of digesting protein only 
after it has come into contact with the intestinal juice. This 



28 



PRACTICAL DIETETICS 



eiiz}Tne is then called trypsin, and the changes which it pro- 
duces in protein are similar to those produced by pepsin; it 
acts, however, in an alkaline medium. 

The products of tryptic digestion are therefore alkali pro- 
tein, proteoses (albumoses) and peptones. 

The bile plays no significant part in protein digestion, ex- 
cept as it helps to neutralize the chyme. 

The intestinal juice contains an enzyme called erepsin, 
which completes the digestion of protein, breaking down the 
proteoses and peptones formed by pepsin and trypsin into 
still less complex compounds called amino acids. These are 
the " end-products " of protein digestion. The digestive 
process can go no farther. There are no enzymes acting on 
proteins in the large intestines. 

Summary. The chemical changes in protein during the 
process of digestion are shown in the following table :

DIGESTION 2-> 

DIGESTION OF FAT 

Fat is not acted upon by the secretions of the mouth nor 
to any great extent by those of the stomach. The gastric 
juice contains an enzyme, called gastric lipase, which has the 
power of acting on emulsified fats, such as in cream or yolk 
of eggs. It plays a more important part in the digestion of 
infants than of adults. 

The presence of fat in the stomach retards the secretion of 
gastric juice. Hence a certain excess of fat in the stomach 
is sufficient to close the pylorus for a longer or shorter time, 
due to the failure of the appearance of free hydrochloric acid. 
This doubtless accounts for the fact that fat in the diet often 
seems to retard and otherwise disturb digestion. 

Digestion of fat takes place mainly in the small intestines. 
The pancreatic juice contains an enzyme called steapsin, which 
has the power of emulsifying fats and also of splitting them 
into fatty acids and glycerine. 

The bile contains no such enzymes, but it is nevertheless an 
important factor in the digestion of fat. It has the power of 
increasing greatly the activity of the pancreatic lipase (steap- 
sin), and of holding in solution the fatty acids formed by 
its action, so that they are more perfectly absorbed. When 
bile is lacking, much of the fat fails of absorption and is 
excreted through the intestines. Emulsification is an im- 
portant aid in the splitting of fat into fatty acids and glycer- 
ine, the forms in which fat is chiefly absorbed. 
DIGESTION OF CARBOHYDRATES 

1. Digestion of Starch. There is little doubt that prim- 
itive man accomplished much of the digestion of starch in the 
mouth. The saliva contains two enzymes, ptyalin, and ma\- 
tase. By the action of ptyalin starch is changed to dextrins 
and these to maltose; by the action of maltase, maltose is 
converted into dextrose, the end-product of salivary digestion. 
The crude uncooked food required prolonged mastication be- 
fore it could be swallowed, and during this mastication the 
enzvmes had opportunity for action. Eaw starch is so very 



30 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

slowly affected by enzymes, that much of the food value of un- 
cooked cereals is lost, so that the practice of baking ground 
grain into bread developed very early. This fact in regard 
to starch digestion is often disregarded by advocates of a re- 
turn to raw foods. 

There is said to be some evidence that a pharyngeal reflex 
once existed which prevented the bolting of foods which are 
capable of salivary digestion, or which are not easily di- 
gestible without mastication. In recent years, Mr. Horace 
Fletcher has counseled a return to prolonged mastication, in 
order that salivary digestion may be carried to its fullest ex- 
tent. It is claimed that the more perfect utilization of all 
food eaten necessitates the taking of a smaller amount. 
There is no doubt that thorough mastication renders the di- 
gestion of starch easier and more complete, but it will not 
greatly alter the total food requirement. 

The starchy food mixed with saliva passes from the mouth 
to the stomach and lodges in the fundus, the portions last 
eaten always going to the center of the mass. Thus, while 
the gastric juice is at work upon the outer layer, attacking 
the protein of the diet, the inner portions remain alkaline for 
c considerable time, so that salivary digestion may continue 
undisturbed. 

From time to time, the soluble products of salivary and 
gastric digestion pass into the small intestine. Here the con- 
version of starch and intermediate products into simple sugars 
is completed. The pancreatic juice contains an enzyme called 
amylopsin, which acts like ptyalin, i. e., changes starch to 
dextrins, and finally to maltose. 

The intestinal juice contains an enzyme capable of chang- 
ing maltose to dextrose, the final product in starch digestion. 

Summary. The chemical changes in starch during the 
process of digestion are shown in the following table :

2. Digestion of Sugars. Although sugars are perfectly 
soluble and easily absorbed, they must all be converted into 
monosaccharides or simple sugars (chiefly dextrose), before 
they can be utilized by the body. Hence we find a number 
of enzymes in the alimentary tract acting upon disaccharides. 
Two of these have already been indicated in discussing the 
digestion of starch, i. e., the maltases of the saliva and in- 
testinal juice, which convert each molecule of maltose into 
two of dextrose. In the stomach, a slight hydrolysis of the 
disaccharides may occur through the influence of the hydro- 
chloric acid. In the intestines, provision is made for their 
complete transformation. Both the pancreatic and intestinal 
juices contain enzymes of this type. In young animals, or 
older individuals on a milk diet, the pancreatic juice con- 
tains lactase, which converts lactose (milk sugar) into dex- 
trose and galactose. The intestinal juice contains three such 
enz^-mes, sucrose, acting on sucrose (cane sugar) ; lactase, 
acting on lactose ; and maltase, acting on maltose. 

Summary. The chemical changes in sugar during the 
process of digestion are shown in the following table:

RESTJME OF DIGESTION 

The processes of digestion are both mechanical and chem- 
ical. By mechanical processes the foods are first softened 
and finely divided, so as to be non-irritating to the walls of 
the alimentary tract, and to expose as much surface as pos- 
sible to the action of the digestive enzymes; secondly, they 
are moved along the alimentary tract from time to time, to 
facilitate digestion and absorption, and to expel indigestible 
residues. The movements of the mouth in mastication, of 
the oesophagus in swallowing, and of the intermediate and 
pyloric regions of the stomach in mixing the food with the 
gastric juice; the rhythmic and peristaltic movements of the 
small intestines, by which the food is alternately churned in 
a stationary position and then pushed along to a new region 
to repeat the process; and finally, the anti-peristaltic move- 
ments of the first part of the large intestines and the slow 
peristalsis throughout its entire length, form a series of events 
of tremendous importance to the welfare of the organism. 

By chemical processes, complex food-stuffs are converted 
into simpler substances out of which the body can build the

compounds essential to its persistence and activity. The di- 
gestive fluids and the enzymes contained therela, with the

The bile contains no important enzymes, but greatly facilitates the diges- 
tion of fats. The intestinal juice contains an enzyme which makes trypsin 
an active enzyme, and a substance which helps to stimulate the flow of 
pancreatic juice. 



34 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Inspection of the table on page 44 shows that there are five 
so-calJed digestive juices, viz.: saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic 
3uice, bile, and intestinal juice. All are produced intermit- 
tently except the bile, which is secreted continuouslv into the 
ga 1-bladder and discharged at intervals into the 'intestine. 
All are alkaline except the gastric juice. All contain power- 
ful enzymes except the bile. Enzymes which digest protein 
occur in the gastric juice (pepsin), the pancreatic juice (tryp- 
sm), and the intestinal juice (erepsin). Ferments which 
transform starch to sugar occur especially in the saliva and 
pancreatic juices, and are commonly known as diastatic 
enzymes. Ptyalin is an old name for salivary diastase, amy- 
lopsm for pancreatic diastase. 

The principal fat-splitting enzyme occurs in the pan- 
creatic juice, and is known as pancreatic lipase or steapsin. 
J^umerous enzymes of minor importance occur in the c^astric 
pancreatic, and intestinal juices. Bile in itself is able to 
emulsify fat as a step toward digestion. 

PACTORS DETERMINING RATE OF DIGESTION 

We know of the existence of many factors which influence 
salivary and gastric digestion, but much less about intestinal 
digestion. Among these are the nature of the food, cook- 
^7' ^.PP?*'*^' mastication, palatability, mental state, amount 
o± fluid m the meal, the pyloric reflexes, etc. The nature of 
the individual plays a powerful role; some individuals can 
subsist almost wholly upon one or a few articles, while others 
quickly revolt against monotony of diet. Idiosyncrasy is 
another important factor; for example, some individuals can- 
not eat mutton, however disguised, while in others sugar is 
so strong a stimulant to peristalsis that it sets up a violent 
diarrhoea. The above being true of presumably healthy peo- 
ple, the factors which may influence digestion in the sick, 
invalid and convalescent must be still more uncertain! 
Hence tables which purport to give the relative digestibility 
of foods must be studied with allowances. We can study this 
problem in test tubes, or by examining the washings from the 



ABSOEPTION 35 

stomach after definite meals or in fistula patients, but the 
results can hardly be applied forthwith to all persons. 

The direct stimuli to the secretion of saliva are the sight, 
odor or taste of food; or the mechanical irritation produced 
by contact of food-stuffs with the mouth. Indirectly, the 
thought of food may be a psychic stimulus to the flow of 
saliva. Excitement may so check the flow of saliva that it 
is impossible to swallow dry food. 

The stimuli to the secretion of gastric juice are both psychic 
and chemical. Pawlow has demonstrated, in the case of 
dogs, that the sight of food or the chewing of food in the 
mouth may produce a very effective flow of gastric juice, to 
which he attributes great importance in digestion. How im- 
portant this preliminary flow before food enters the stomach 
may be in the case of man has not been very clearly demon- 
strated ; but it seems reasonable that the desire for eatino:. the 
act of eating and the pleasure obtained therefrom exercise 
a favorable influence upon gastric secretion. It has recently 
been shown that the products of salivary digestion act as 
a stimulus to the flow of gastric juice, and that once the 
process of gastric digestion is initiated, the products of pep- 
tic activity cause the continuance of the secretion as long 
as the food remains in the stomach. The mere mechanical 
irritation caused by the presence of food in the stomach is 
ineffective. Thus white of egg will cause no flow. But cer- 
tain substances, such as meat extracts, bitters and condiments, 
promote secretion. The use of meat broths, gelatin jellies, 
peptones (i. e., products of gastric digestion), and toast (con- 
taining dextrins or products of salivary digestion), at the 
beginning of a meal, or to promote feeble gastric digestion in 
an invalid, is therefore a rational practice. 

ABSORPTION 

While absorption through a permeable animal membrane 
outside the body may be a simple physical process, following 
the ordinary laws of pressure, diffusion, osmosis, etc., the case

substances, such as sugars and peptones, pass to a limited 
extent through its walls. The most important seat of absorp- 
tion IS the small intestme, and second, the large intestine 
Absorption m the small intestine is affected through the in^ 
numerable Lttle projections with which the intestine is lined 
known as villi, which greatly extend the amount of surface' 
These villi contain a capillary network and a so-called lac- 
teal space. The capillaries by converging into larger vessels 
eventually form the portal vein which passes thfough the 
iver. The lacteal spaces are prolonged into lymphatic ves- 
sels which similarly converge to form the thoracic duct. The 
lacteals are intended almost wholly for the absorption of the 
lats, all other digestive products passing through the liver 
betore reaching the general circulation. 

Absorption continues throughout the length of the lar^e 
intestine, being especially favored by antiperistalsis in the 
upper portions. Constipation sometimes results from the 
great absorptive power of this region, the feces being left dry 
and hard and hence difficult to evacuate 

Ahsorption of Protein. It was long a matter of doubt as 
to the form m which proteins were absorbed, but there was a 
strong inclination to believe that they were transformed into 
protein before being transported by the blood, because it 
was almost impossible to detect amino acids in the blood or 
tissues. A\e now know that this was due to the imperfection 
of our chemical methods. It has recently been demonstrated 
by several independent investigators that amino acids are 
absorbed from the intestines, circulate in the blood, and pa«s 



ABSORPTION 37 

to the tissues, and that the cells of the bodj' are able to take 
them up and use them according to their needs. Animas 
have been made to store protein when the only nitrogen 
supplied to the blood was in the form of amino acids. 

Traces of protein, proteoses or peptones, may be absorbed 
from the stomach or intestines, but ordinarily the amount is 
negligible. Such products when present in the blood tend 
to pass quickly into the urine. The peculiar idios}'ncrasy of 
jioisoning from such foods as eggs, milk, fish, etc., is thought 
to be due to the influence of traces of absorbed proteins to 
which the subject shows an anaphylactic reaction. 

Absorption of Fat. It is now commonly believed that fat 
is absorbed in the form of the end products of its digestion, 
i. e., fatty acids and glycerine, and that somewhere in the 
intestinal wall these are recombined into neutral fat. It is 
possible that some of the finely emulsified fat is able to pass 
unchanged through the intestinal wall. In either case, mi- 
nute fat droplets pass into the lacteals, and finally into the 
blood stream by way of the thoracic duct. A small portion 
finds its way directly into the blood. 

Fats having a low melting point are absorbed more quickly 
than solid fats, and pure fat more readily than fat inter- 
mingled with other food principles, as in fat meat. 

Absorption of Carbohydrates. The end products of carbo- 
hydrate digestion pass to the blood by way of the portal sys- 
tem. The monosaccharides on reaching the liver enter the 
general circulation as dextrose if required for immediate use ; 
otherwise they are stored in the liver in the form of glycogen, 
which can be again transformed into sugar when demanded 
by the system to furnish energy. Sugars are so readily ab- 
sorbed that if taken in large quantities the body may be un- 
able to utilize them, and the excess is excreted in the urine. 
This is especially true in case of an excess of cane sugar or 
milk sugar. They may be absorbed before digestion, and 
there are no enzymes in the blood capable of converting them 
into dextrose so that they can be burned or stored. Under 
such circumstances they are useless and must be gotten rid of. 
If maltose is absorbed too rapidh', it may still be changed to 



38 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

dextrose by enzymes in the blood or tissues, and so be utilized. 

Ahsorpiion of Mineral Matter. As salts are not digested 
in the ordinary sense of the word, they require nothing more 
than solution in the digestive fluids before absorption. The 
mineral matter is set free from food and diffuses more or less 
rapidly into the surrounding fluids. Common salt is most 
quickly absorbed. The chief locality for absorption is the 
small intestine. The older text books taught that salts 
were absorbed only by diffusion through the intestinal wall, 
which required that another solution must at the same time 
pass from the blood to the intestines until both fluids were 
of the same degree of concentration. It appears, however, 
that in the main, mineral matter is taken up in the intestinal 
wall without diffusion, and as fast as it can be incorporated 
with certain peculiar solvents is absorbed into the blood. 

Absorption of Water. Water it not absorbed by the stom- 
ach, but passes quickly in little spurts (if taken alone) into 
the intestines. Here it is very rapidly absorbed ; it may be 
excreted through the kidneys within twenty minutes after 
ingestion. The rapidity of absorption may be considerably 
influenced by mineral matter dissolved in the water. 

Summary. Absorption is an active, not a passive process. 
It takes place mainly in the intestines, the larger part before 
the food reaches the ileo-cecal valve. 

Proteins are absorbed by the villi, chiefly in the form of 
amino acids and pass through the portal vein to the liver. 

Fats are absorbed b}^ the lacteals, chiefly in the form of 
fatty acids and glycerine, but pass to the lymphatics as neu- 
tral fat, and enter the blood stream from the thoracic duct. 

Carbohydrates are absorbed by the villi in the form of su- 
gar (chiefly dextrose) and pass through the portal vein to 
the liver. 

Unabsorbed material passes out as part of the feces (see 
Excretion, page 53). Undigested proteins, fats and car- 
bohydrates are liable to attack by putrefactive and fermenta- 
tive organisms in the intestines. The products of such bac- 
terial action are absorbed to a considerable extent. Carbohy- 
drates which escape digestion tend to produce lactic and 



METABOLISM 39 

other acids. This fermentation is not altogether an evil, 
for it checks the putrefaction of undigested meat. The latter 
is undesirable, as the products are likely to prove toxjc. It 
is for this reason that lactic acid, especially in the form of 
buttermilk and artificially fermented sour milk, is largely 
;»mployed as a remedial agent in intestinal indigestion. 

METABOLISM 

Metabolism is the sum of the cliemical changes taking place 
in the cells of the body in connection with all biological 
processes, including growth, repair and waste, generation and 
maintenance of heat, all manifestations of functional activity, 
storage of surplus nutriment, etc. It comprises two phases, 
anabolism and katabolism. ' 

Anabolism embraces the changes involved in the upbuilding 
of the cells, and corresponds in a general way to nutrition. 
Assimilation is the selective act of the cells in appropriating 
the special form of nutriment in the circulating blood which 
is suited for their needs. The special phases of anabolism 
comprise the assimilation of nitrogen for growth and repair 
of protoplasm, the storage of a certain amount of fat and 
carbohydrate, the assimilation of oxygen for maintenance of 
heat and functional activity, and the retention of inorganic 
salts in the bones and other tissues. 

Katabolism comprises the changes involved in the contin- 
uous molecular waste of the cells; in the constant oxidation 
going on in the tissues resulting in the maintenance of animal 
heat; in the exercise of muscular, nervous and secretory ac- 
tivity; and perhaps in the breaking up of protein into 
oxidizable carbohydrates and nitrogenous waste products. 
AVe speak less of the acts of katabolism than of the products 
of katabolism, which are a measure of those acts. The chief 
of these products are : ( 1 ) urea, the chief form of excretion of 
nitrogen, and (2) carbon dioxide and water, which represent 
the products of energy-yielding oxidations. 

Elimination is the escape or expulsion of the products of 



40 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

katabolism from the tissues into the blood, and corresponds 
to disassimilation or denutrition. Excretion is the final ex- 
pulsion of the end products of katabolism from the excretory 
organs and includes the expulsion of unabsorbed aliment by 
the bowel. 

In the case of certain, products of metabolism, it is hardly 
possible to state positively whether they represent anabolism 
or katabolism. Here belong especially the substances formed 
in connection with secretion, as the digestive enz3Tnes, the 
hydrochloric acid of the gastric juice, the iodothyrin of the 
thyroid gland and the adrenalin of the suprarenal gland. In 
all likelihood both factors participate, for certain substances 
must be assimilated from the food to form these bodies which 

in turn are set free in the blood. It is also true that some 

* 

of these substances act by their mere presence, without ap- 
parent waste (catalytic action). 

Metabolism of Protein. A relatively small proportion of 
protein is normally disposed of by oxidation for energy-forma- 
tion, when carbohydrates and fats enter fully into the diet. 
But in their absence, protein, by virtue of the fact that it con- 
tains the elements of carbohydrates and fats (carbon, hydro- 
gen and oxygen ) in its molecule, can furnish all the heat and 
force required. Certain savages subsist wholly on meat and 
remain in good health, and in the so-called Salisbury treat- 
ment of obesity, etc., it can be demonstrated at will that a 
patient may subsist for weeks on raw beef without apparent 
detriment, provided plenty of water is drunk, the excess of 
water aiding in the elimination of unutilized nitrogen. 

When absorbed protein reaches the liver, a large part of the 
nitrogen is split off and excreted as urea. The remaining 
portion goes to make good the small daily waste of body 
protein. The portion of the protein molecule left after the 
nitrogen is split off is available as fuel. When carbohydrates 
and fats are liberally supplied, so that protein is not required 
for fuel, the daily amount needed is comparatively small. 
Even when the body is losing nitrogen rapidly, as in certain 
fevers, it has been found that this is partly because the body 



METABOLISM 41 

protein is being used as fuel, and the loss can be largely 
prevented by furnisliing more energy in the form of carbo- 
hydrate or fat. Much confusion has arisen because the excess 
of nitrogen in the diet is to some extent identical in form 
vrith the waste products of cellular activity. Besides urea^ 
some of the chief nitrogenous products of protein metabolism, 
are ammonium salts, uric acid, creatin and creatinin. 

The non-nitrogenous portion of protein may be burned of 
possibly stored, but the nitrogen excess must be eliminated. 
Because of the fact that excess of nitrogen throws work on the 
kidneys, it is assumed that an excessive protein diet is injuri- 
ous to the integrity of these organs. This is evident in dis- 
eased kidneys, but cannot be proved for healthy organs. 
However, it seems unnecessary to consume a great excess of 
protein and perhaps unwise, owing to the great frequency of 
fatal kidney diseases. At any rate, except where protein is 
specially advantageous for ease of digestion, it is unnecessary 
to make it a large part of the diet. 

Metabolism of Fat Fat, which is passed into the blood 
from the thoracic duct, is carried over the body and deposited 
in many organs and tissues, unless needed for immediate use 
as a source of energy, in which case it is oxidized to carbon 
dioxide and water. It has been shown that diet-fat may be 
deposited in the body in the same form as eaten, but the 
readiest means of forming body fat is usually to give an 
excess of carbohydrate. The ease with which carbohydrates 
form fat is shown in the case of cows which produce large 
quantities of butter fat on an herbivorous diet. It is also 
possible to form fat from protein, but it is difficult, as a con- 
siderable part of the energy of the protein molecule goes to 
get rid of the nitrogen, and protein increases the rate of metab- 
olism. ^Ye know very little of the details of fat metabolism. 
Some investigators hold that it must be converted into dex- 
trose before it can be oxidized. As already stated, an excess 
of carbohydrate may be stored in the form of fat. 

MetaloUsm of Carbohydrates. The blood maintains a con- 
stant sugar content of about 0.8 per cent. As fast as thi« 



42 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

s igar is oxidized, it is replaced by more from the store of 
glycogen in the liver and muscles, or from newly-formed 
sugar of recently digested food. The final products of carbo- 
hydrate oxidation are carbon dioxide and water, but several 
intermediate products (as lactic acid) are first formed, prob- 
ably by the action of enzymes. 

When the body is unable to store any more carbohydrate as 
.glycogen, all further storage of excess is in the form of fat. 

Wlien sugar is lacking in the blood, as in starvation or 
failure to utilize carbohydrates, the sugar content is main- 
tained at the expense of protein. This explains why the dia- 
betic who is eating no carbohydrate, may still excrete sugar 
in the urine. There is some experimental evidence that su- 
gar may be formed also from fat. At any rate, fat is oxidized 
in absence of carbohydrate, and whether it is first changed to 
sugar, or oxidized directly, it is a compact means of storing 
energy, since one gram of fat will yield 214 times as much 
as an equal amount of protein or carbohydrate. 

EXCRETION 

The waste products of metabolism and all unutilized food, 
along with the products of oxidation, are eliminated from the 
system in several ways. Water escapes through the lungs, 
skin and kidneys. Aside from the obvious fiuid perspiration, 
a steady evaporation takes place from the skin (insensible 
perspiration). The carbon dioxide produced by oxidation 
escapes by the lungs, and nitrogenous products of protein me- 
tabolism by the urine. The feces in health are made up 
of the secretions and excretions of the alimentary tract, bac- 
teria, indigestible food waste, and a little undigested food 
material. ^Yhen there is excessive putrefaction of the fecal 
matter, some of the soluble material is absorbed and elimi- 
nated in the urine. Generally speaking, putrefaction (of 
nitrogenous food) and fermentation (of carbohydrates) hold 
each other in check. Starving people pass feces, thus show- 
ing that the bowel is a true excretory organ. 



CHAPTER III 

FOOD VALUES 
NITROGEN BALANCE — ENERGY VALUE OF FOOD 

ATe are now in position to understand something of food 
values, which depend on the food actually utilized in the body, 
to the exclusion of food unabsorbed, or eliminated because in 
excess of the demands of the system. Energy-yielding ma- 
terial which is not used at the time may be stored, but be- 
yond a certain point, stored nutriment must be regarded as 
undesirable, as in obese subjects. 

As stated by Atwater, the food supplies body wants in five 
ways: (1) tissue-building, (2) tissue-repairing, (3) storage 
for future use, (4) oxidation to maintain animal heat and (5) 
oxidation to supply energy; or we may say that according to 
function, foods are classified as tissue-formers, or body-build- 
ers; energy (or work and heat) producers; and regulators of 
body processes. (See page 4.) 

NITROGEN BALANCE OR NITROGEN EQUILIBRIUM 

In body building and repairing, the nitrogen of protein 
food is indispensable. In the other functions, nitrogen is not 
utilized. Carbohydrates and fats are the natural and con- 
venient sources of energy, although the protein contains in 
itself non-nitrogenous material capable of oxidation. As al- 
ready stated, however, to depend largely upon protein for 
oxidizable food means the ingestion of an enormous quantity 
of unnecessary nitrogen, the getting rid of which involves 
waste of energy and is thought to necessitate a strain upon 
the excretory system. Furthermore, when the diet consists 
chiefly of protein, much of the latter may not be digested and 
absorbed as such, but may remain in the intestine, there to 

43 



44 PBACTICAL DIETETICS 

undergo putrefactive changes. In the course of putrefaction 
certain soluble poisonous substances form and are absorbed, 
requiring elimination by the kidneys. The excess of nitrogen 
which cannot be utilized in tissue repair must also be elimi- 
nated by the kidneys. Thus while people may thrive on a 
diet rich in protein, there is considerable evidence that vital- 
ity, endurance and resistance to disease are better attained 
with a diet in which the fuel foods (carbohydrates and fats) 
predominate. 

Nitrogen cannot be stored to any extent and is constantly 
eliminated in the urine as urea and other nitrogenous sub- 
stances. When the diet-nitrogen corresponds in amount with 
the eliminated nitrogen, the metabolism of nitrogen is bal- 
anced, or in a state of equilibrium. If too small a quantity 
of nitrogenous food is taken it does not compensate for the 
waste of body nitrogen which is inseparable from life. The 
same thing occurs when for any reason the food nitrogen is 
not absorbed, or is eliminated without being utilized. This 
condition of nitrogen starvation is characteristic of under- 
feeding, wasting diseases, defective assimilation, etc. Con- 
versely equilibrium between food nitrogen and excreted ni- 
trogen represents good nutrition, health and energy ; for while 
nitrogen cannot be permanently stored, it is possible for a 
balance to be maintained over long periods. It was once 
taught that increased elimination of nitrogen was due chiefly 
to the waste of tissue incidental to prolonged and severe 
muscular or nervous effort ; at a later period, however, it be- 
came apparent that this waste was comparatively little, and 
constant for the individual regardless of the amount of muscu- 
lar exercise, so that the urea nitrogen depends chiefly on the 
amount of diet nitrogen. The loss of nitrogen in wasting 
disease, starvation, etc., is, however, extensive ; so that in con- 
valescence the body is able to store some nitrogen. 

Nitrogen retention is greatly facilitated in all cases by a 
liberal supply of carbohydrates and fats. 

Nitrogen metabolism can hardly be studied in the ordinary 
patient, on account of the number and variety of tests which 



ENERGY VALUE 45 

must be accurately made, so that our only guide is the results 
of scientific investigation of the amounts of nitrogen required 
under given conditions, and the general well-being of the 
subject. If weight is maintained, along with a healthy state 
of functions, the ration in question is suitable for the sub- 
ject tested. If the individual be in the growing period, the 
ration should be such that the growth rate is normal. If 
he be a convalescent, the recovery of the original weight should 
be constantly progressive. Of late years, however, the em- 
phasis on nitrogen values alone has been largly superseded 
by greater attention to total fuel values as being of greater 
practical worth. It is known that a relatively small and 
easily obtained quantity of nitrogen is sufficient to repair waste 
in the average individual, but the food required for producing 
energy is very significant in amount. With a liberal supply 
of carbohydrates and fats, the ordinary daily waste of nitrogen 
in one adult may be reduced as low as 3 to 4 grams daily 
(corresponding to 20 to 25 grams of protein). 

To insure a full supply of nitrogen, and to maintain ni- 
trogen equilibrium at a higher level than the bare maintenance 
requirement, considerably more than this amount is commonly 
taken. From 80 to 100 grams of protein per day is re- 
garded as a liberal supply for an average man (weighing TO 
kilograms or 154 lbs.) on an ordinary mixed diet of suitable 
energy value. 

THE ENEEGY VAITTE OF FOOD 

In Liebig's time it was recognized that animal heat was 
generated by carbohydrates and fats, but the physiologists of 
that day did not realize that these were the nutrients which 
furnished the body with energy for its activity. They 
thought that all muscular work was done at the expense of 
"itrogenous material. It has taken many years for us to 
realize fully that animal energy in all its forms is derived 
primarily from carbohydrate material, secondly from fats, and 
thirdly from proteins only in so far as they yield combustible, 
non-nitrogenous bodies. 



46 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Energy may be defined as the power to do work. This 
force manifests itself in different ways. It may be latent, 
or inactive; or it may be active in various forms, such as 
heat ; chemical or electrical energy ; or mechanical movement, 
which -we call work. It may be changed from one of these 
forms into another without loss. The most convenient way to 
measure energy is by transforming it into heat. A unit^has 
been devised to express different amounts of heat, correspond- 
ing to a definite number of work units; this is called the 
calorie. One calorie represents the amount of heat required 
to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water one degree 
Centigrade. This is called the large calorie, which is com- 
monly used in determining the energy value of food. The 
small calorie is unrar of a large calorie. 

Energy cannot be created. We must put into any machine 
as much force as we expect to get from it. Even in the most 
efficient machine we cannot recover all of the energy in the 
form of useful work; some of it is always transformed into 
heat, owing to friction. This is true even in the body, which 
is a most efficient machine, but here much of the waste energy 
in the form of heat is turned to good account in maintaining 
the body temperature. 

The source of energy for the body is food, just as much as 
the source of energy for the engine is coal. Plants store up 
the sun's energy, it is transferred to animals which eat the 
plants, and eventually man gets it by eating the plant and 
animal foods. The amount of energy in any given food ma- 
terial is measured by the amount of heat which it will pro- 
duce. In general, this is the same, whether the food be 
burned outside or inside the body, the total result in any case 
depending upon the amount of the food-stuff which is utilized 
by the body. 

An instrument devised for the measurement of heat is 
called a calorimeter. To determine the fuel value of any 
food material outside of the body, a given amount is placed 
in a calorimeter, where it is burned in an atmosphere of pure 
oxygen, in a vessel surrounded by water. The heat generated 



ENERGY VALUE 47 

raises the temperature of the water, and the change is ob- 
served with a very delicate thermometer. From this the 
total heat evolved is calculated. To determine the fuel value 
of this material within the body, the average amount which 
is lost in digestion, or which is not completely oxidized before 
excretion, is deducted from the fuel value outside the body. 
The result is the physiological fuel value. Many years ago, 
Rubner determined averages for proteins, fats, and carbohy- 
drates from experiments on dogs. In recent times, further 
experiments made in this country on human subjects by Prof. 
Atwater and his associates have modified these factors some- 
what. The following are therefore accepted as the average 
energy values of food in the body to-day : 

1 gram of Protein yields 4 Calories 

1 gram of Fat yields 9 Calories 

1 gram of Carbohydrate . . . yields 4 Calories 

DETERMINATION OF ENERGY VALUE OF FOOD 

To determine the energy value of a given amount of any 
food, it is necessary to know first its composition, i. e., the 
percentages of protein, fat, and carbohydrate present. Tables 
are available giving the results of many analyses, as in Bulle- 
tin 28, Office of Experiment Station, United States Dept. of 
Agriculture, Washington, D. C, "The Chemical Composi- 
tion of American Food Materials." 

Second. From these percentages to determine the weight 
of protein fat and carbohydrate in grams, which can be ob- 
tained from a given amount of the food material. 

Third. To multiply these weights by the energj-- value of 
one gram of each of the three food principles. 

By way of illustration let us find the fuel value of one loaf 
of bread, weighing 13 ounces. 

(1) By referring to Bulletin 28, we find that white bread 
(miscellaneous) yields on the average, 

9.3 % protein. 
1.2 % fat. 
52.7 % carbohydrate. 



48 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

(2) To get the weight of protein, fat and carbohydrate in 
grams, we must first convert the total weight of bread into 
grams, 

1 oz. = 28.35 grams. 
12 oz. = 340.2 grams. 
Then 340.2 X 0.093 = 31.64 grams of protein. 
340.2 X 0.012 = 4.08 grams of fat. 
340.2 X 0.527 = 179.28 grams of carbohydrate. 

(3) Multiplying the amount of each nutrient by the proper 
factor, 

31.64 grams protein X 4 = 126.56 Calories 

4.08 grams fat X 9 = 36.72 Calories 

179.28 grams carbohydrate X 4 = 717.12 Calories 

Total 880.40 Calories 

Hence the total energy value of 1 loaf of bread weighing 12 
ounces is 880.4 calories. 

To calculate the total energy value of any combination of 
foods, it is necessary to compute the fuel value of each in- 
gredient, and take the sum of the whole group. 

Thus for Egg Broth, page 118, it is necessary first to get 
the weight in grams of each of the following ingredients and 
then to estimate their energy value as indicated above. 

Yolk of 1 egg = 13 grams. 

1 tablespoon sugar = 15 grams. 

1 cup milk =244 grams. 

1 tablespoon brandy == 14 .rrams. 

In this book the food values of all the materials used have 
been incorporated into a table, so that by reference to this 
the value of any combination is quickly made. 

Yolk of 1 egg = 48 Calories. 

1 tablespoon sugar =z 60 Calories. 

1 cup milk =169 Calories. 

1 tablespoon brandy 1 = 42 Calories. 

Total energy value 319 Calories. 

*The energy value of alcohol is 7 calories per gram. It is necessary, 
therefore, to know the per cent, of alcohol in any liquor. 



ENERGY REQUIREMENT 49 

To estimate the fuel value of any diet, it is simply necessary 
to compute the food value of each food material used and add 
the results together. 

To estimate the fuel value of an infant's diet, the following 
formula, adapted to the above factors for energy value from 
Friedenwald and Euhrah's Diet in Health and Disease, is 
very convenient. 

Formula for calculating the Calories of Any Period of 
Infant Feeding: 

{ 1 ) Quantity X F X 2.65 = Calories from fat. 

(2) Quantity X (S + P) X 1.18 = Calories from protein and sugar. 

The sum of 1 and 2 gives the total calories. 

Quantity := 24-hour amount in ounces. F, S and P = 
fat, sugar, and protein respectively, with percents in whole 
numbers. 

To illustrate, take a formula of the following composition; 

Protein 0.7% 

Fat 2.7% 

Carbohydrates 6.0% 

Feedings per day 9, amount at each finding 11/2 oz. 

Hence Q = 13.5 oz. (9 X iVg) 
F= 2.7 oz. 
S= 6 oz. 
P= 0.7 oz. 

(1) Q. X F X 2.65 = 13.5 X 2.7 X 2.65 = 96.6 Cal. 

(2) Q. X (S + P) X 1.18 = 13.5 X (6 + 0.7) X 1.18 = 106.7 Cal. 

96.6 + 106.7 = 203.3 Cal., total for day. 

THE ENERGY REQITIREMENTS OF THE BODY 
"Work goes on continually in the living body, whether asleep 
or awake, idle or active, sick or well. In the resting body it 
consists of such internal work as that of digestion and absorp- 
tion, circulation, respiration, muscular tension, and intracellu- 
lar work. 

In youth these functions are more active than in adult life; 
in old age they are somewhat less active. 



50 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

For a man of average weight (154 lbs. or 70 kg.) from 
1600 to 2000 cal. daily are required to supply energy for 
these internal activities. Children require somewhat n^ore in 
proportion to their body weight, aged persons somewhat less 
Beyond this, the factor of most significance in determining the 
total food requirement for any individual is the amount of 
muscular activity. A man requiring 100 cal. per hour at 
rest may by hard work raise his energy requirement as high 
as 500 or 600 cal. per hour. For this reason a person en- 
gaged m a sedentary occupation needs less food than one- 
whose work is physical, as a farmer or lumberman. Children 
are usually more active than adults, and hence in proportion 
to their weight require more food, while inactive aged per- 
sons require very little. 

Averages obtained from many observations on the amount 
of food consumed by individuals under different conditions, 
show that the energy requirement of the active man of 7o' 
kgs. body weight is approximately 3000 calories. 

In making estimates for any individual, age, weight, size 
and shape, season and climate, mechanical efficiency,' etc., 
must be considered as well as muscular activity. 

During the early months of life, children require about 100 
cal per kilogram of body weight. Throughout the years of 
childhood, they need about 80 calories per kilogram The 
adult moderately active, 35-40 cal. per kilogram, and the 
very aged, about 27 cal. per kilogram. 

" The following table, computed by Rubner, shows the daily 
heat consumption, in units of heat (calories) in an adult 
weighing 65 kilograms or 140 lbs." 

During rest in bed.. 1800 calories or 28 Cal. per kiloeram 

i° f.«P°«« 2100 calories or 32 Cal. per kilogram. 

In light work 2300 calories or 33 Cal. per kilogram 

In moderate work.. 2600 calories or 40 Cal. per kilogram 

In hard work 3100 calories or 48 Cal. per kilogram. 

The total energy requirement for individuals under differ- 
ent conditions of age, weight, and activity are approximately 
as indicated in the following table:

To illustrate the use of this table, let us calculate the 
energy requirement of a woman weighing 120 lbs., under 
the following conditions : 

Sleeps 9 hours 9 X 65 = 585 Cal. 

Works at desk 8 hours 8 X 100 = 800 Cal. 

Walks or does light exercise 3 hrs 3 X 170 = 510 Cal. 

Reads or sits quietly sewing 4 hrs 4 X 100 = 400 Cal. 

2295 Cal. 

Since these factors are for a man weighing 154 lbs., for a 
woman of 120 lbs. under above conditions, reduce this pro- 
portionately to her weight, 

154 : 120 : : 2295 : X 

X= 1788 cal. — total energy requirement for 
a woman of 120 lbs., under the above conditions.

ro- 



The protein requirement is conveniently estimated by p 
Tiding 10-12 per cent, of the day's energy in the form of 
protein. Thus for a man whose energy requirement is 3000 
cal. per day, 360 cal. from protein (13 per cent.) would 
correspond to 90 grams of protein, which would be a fairly 
liberal allowance. 

A tall thin person requires more food than a short fat 
person of equal weight. Also, the person of nervous tem- 
permanent, in whom muscular tension is high, may require 
more food than one of phlegmatic temperament. More en- 
ergy is lost in the form of heat in cold weather than in warm. 
Because of the numerous factors involved in any case, it is 
possible to calculate the absolute energy requirement only 
by rigid scientific experiment. The tables given above, how- 
ever, are a useful guide to the approximate amount of food 
required by different individuals. 

As an aid to easy estimation of the food value of any diet, 
the following tables have been introduced, showing the nutri- 
tive value of the food materials used in the recipes in this 
book, calculated for the quantities commonly required in 
cooking for individuals. 

^ The values for larger amounts will be easily obtained by 
simple multiplicatioii.

' The materials are measured in standard 8-ounce measuring cups, or tablespoons. 
The measures are exactly level unless otherwise stated. Note page 98 for measures, 
weights, and abbreviations. 

' The weights assigned to the various measurements in this table have been deter- 
mined carefully, but are the results of a limited number of experiments, and hence must 
be regarded as only approximate. The food values are given with sufficient accuracy 
to be within the limits of error of computations made on average analysis of food-stuffs. 
A number of the values ."tated are based upon the tables of Atwaters and Bryant, Scball 
and Heisler. Arnold's Diet Chart, Dr. W. Coleman, Hill and Eckman. 

Many of the pound calculations in this table are quoted from Dr. Rose's "Labora- 
tory Manual of Dietetics," published by Macmillan Co., New York. 

' Carbohydrates — For list of foods arranged approximately to per cent of carbohy- 
drates note page 371. For list of foods in order of their carbohydrate content from the 
lowest to highest note page 368. 

* Five-per-cent thrice-cooked (boiled) vegetables are considered carbohydrate free. 
Five-per-cent vegetables (cooked) "100 grams" are measured "2 heaping tbsp." 
although in reality the weight varies slightly.

' For practical purposes, the milk sugar may be measured in a medicine glass. Each 
measured ounce equals 18 grams in weight. If milk sugar is added to water in the 
proportion of 24 grams to 3 c.c. and the water brought to the boiling point the milk 
sugar is completely dissolved. Such a solution made daily or just before use will be 
found convenient in administering the diet. (Coleman)

CHAPTER IV 
FEEDING THE SICK 

GENERAL RULES 

In the treatment of disease there are few questions which 
have to be considered so often in the daily routine of practice 
as those which concern the proper support and nourishment of 
the patient. 

A good nurse will never exceed or depart from the phy- 
sician's instructions ; but there are occasions when her posses- 
sion of accurate, even if limited, knowledge on the subject 
of chemical and physiological action of food will enable a 
physician to give more definite directions, greatly assisting 
him in the performance of his duties, and adding to the com- 
fort and well-being of the patient. 

Physician's Directions. The nurse's directions in refer- 
ence to feeding her patient should be written, stating how 
much food may be given, its form, preparation and time of 
serving. In pneumonia, typhoid and all acute serious con- 
ditions, a record of all these details should be kept, also a 
record of the quantity of fluid and medicine taken. 

The nurse has a far better opportunity than the physician 
to judge of all the conditions of the patient's digestion, and 
his likes and dislikes for different foods, and she should not 
fail to report them to the physician in charge and under- 
stand very definitely to what extent she is to be permitted to 
humor her patient, and substitute one form of food or drink 
for another. 

It may happen from lack of care or indefinite instruction, 
that the food served will neutralize the effect of the med- 
icine, either by overfeeding, or by irregularities in feeding, 

73 



FEEDING THE SICK 73 

which disturb digestion and interfere with the beneficial ef- 
fect of the medicine. 

Those who are ill are often allowed to drift into critical 
conditions through not being properly supplied with such 
nutritive material as their enfeebled powers can digest 
Many have perished because those around them did not know 
how to feed them, and either withheld food altogether, or 
gave that which was unsuitable, through ignorance. Even 
when the patient is confined to bed and prevented from tak- 
ing any kind of voluntary exercise, he still requires energy for 
the involuntary action of heart, lungs, and the other processes 
of living, and healthy nutrition must be provided for by a 
supply of suitable food. 

Often the nurse may conscientiously serve one form of 
food ordered, offering it in spite of the patient's dislike and 
nausea with the result of half starving him. WTien her in- 
structions have not been specific, or have not provided for 
emergencies, she should make it a point to have them clearly 
understood at the next visit of the physician. 

To be able to carry out these instructions and offer nourish- 
ment intelligently, a thorough practical knowledge of dietetics 
is necessary, and should be the foundation of every nurse'." 
training. If we wish to succeed in avoiding nausea, vomit- 
ing, loss of strength, and even loss of life, we must learn to 
offer food to the patient in a suitable form, in the quantity 
and at the times suited to his digestive power, and so adapt 
his food to his capabilities. 

This subject has been so ably treated by Dr. Thompson 
(Practical Dietetics, 2d ed.) in his chapter, " Adminis'tration 
of Food for the Sick," that permission has been asked, and 
kindly granted, to use extracts from that chapter; also, by 
the kindness of Mrs. Ellen H. Eichards, quotations have been 
made from the article, " Nourishment in Acute Disease," from 
the " Eumford Kitchen Leaflets." 

Feeding in Acute Disease. The preparation of food for 
those who are seriously ill is a matter of vital importance, 
for the life of the patient often depends either upon the 



74 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

maintenance of strength during the acute period of the dis- 
ease or on the recovery of power during convalescence. Since 
acute disease is accompanied by fever, we must consider the 
effect of feeding in cases where the temperature is febrile in 
character; also the amount of food, its quality and quantity, 
together with other conditions affecting its absorption. 

In acute disease accompanied by fever, what are the con- 
ditions? The body loses weight, urea is increased and car- 
bonic acid and water are excreted in larger amounts than in 
health. All of this loss is not dangerous if permitted to go 
on for a few days only, and if the amounts do not exceed 
certain limits. But to replace these losses we are at a dis- 
advantage as regards the ability of the system to assimilate 
food. In fevers the appetite is small, or may be completely 
lost. The saliva, the gastric juice, pancreatic fluid, the bile, 
are less efficient in action or diminished in amount during 
high temperature. 

The stomach is very sensitive, in part, perhaps, through 
sympathy with the increased sensitiveness of the nervous sys- 
tem as a whole. If there is much hyperaesthesia of the diges- 
tive tract, as in typhoid, in peritonitis, in dysentery or gastro- 
enteritis, one must be careful not to give too much food at 
a time, and it should be in a liquid form and partially pre- 
digested. Note Typhoid Diet, page 337. 

Evidences of Digestion. Our attention should be devoted 
not only to what is put into the alimentary canal, but also to 
what goes out. For instance, if curds of undigested milk 
are found in the stools of a typhoid patient, the quantity of 
milk sGould be diminished, or it should be diluted. 

Every careful observer of the sick will agree that manv 
patients are starved, simply from the w?nt of attention to 
the means which alone make it possible for them to take 
food. For example, if the patient has a fever with remis- 
sion and intermission, it is of the first importance to remem- 
ber that the ability to digest food at these intermissions is 
greater, and it is then that the most nourishing portions of 
diet should be given. 



FEEDING THE SICK 75 

It must be borne in mind that, contrary to the prevalent 
notion, the increase of body heat is not entirely responsible 
for the -wasting of the fever patient. The emaciation is due 
partly to the inability to receive and digest the food, which 
in turn arises from the irritable state of the stomach and 
bowels and the defective secretion of the digestive fluids. 

It is the administration of unsuitable food that must be 
guarded against, and also the giving of nourishment in 
quantities and at times unsuited to the digestive powers of 
the patient. All food is changed into liquid in the process 
of digestion before it can be absorbed into the blood. Liquid 
food, therefore, is given to the very sick because it can be 
digested with the smallest amount of labor to the body. 

Predigested milk possesses the decided advantage in that 
it aids the assimilation of the milk without adding to its 
bulk, as do lime water and other substances. 

By diluting milk, stimulants and gruels too much, the 
quantity of the fluid is so great that the patient soon tires 
of swallowing, and stops before enough nourishment has been 
obtained. One should not give what cannot be digested, nor 
less than can be assimilated. So the attendant must have a 
constant watch over the condition of the patient's powers of 
digestion, and it is necessary for her to know how to choose 
such variety in the diet as to include both what is palatable 
and what will afford a proper amount of nourishment. 

The Appetite. As the appetite of the sick often requires 
tempting, the greatest pai^s should be taken in the prepara- 
tion of the invalid's food. The lack of desire for food may 
be due merely to defective cooking, to the serving of meals at 
inopportune moments, or to the fact that the food selected 
is not to the patient's liking in kind, flavor, or appearance. 
A desire for food may exist, but 'not for the particular food 
offered, and it is the province of the nurse to differentiate. 

Punctuality in serving meals should be carefully observed, 
for an appetite ready at the accustomed hour may fail if the 
meal is delayed. There is much unconscious habit in re- 
gard to eating. Time for cooking food should be carefully 



76 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

considered with regard to the time for serving. Many foods 
properly cooked are spoiled by standing, which if served 
promptly would be delicious. The rule of serving food at 
stated intervals should be observed for the conscious as well 
as the unconscious or semi-unconscious patient. 

Quality and Quantity of Food. All foods supplied should 
be as pure and fresh as possible. Hence for the sick it is 
desirable to select the best quality obtainable. 

The amount should be regulated by the physician. "When 
this is not done, care must be taken, on the one hand to see 
that suflScient is eaten, which often necessitates tempting the 
appetite; and on the other to avoid overindulgence if the 
patient is voracious or has a fancy for certain articles of 
which large amounts are likely to be harmful. 

A well man, lying quietly in bed, requires from 1600 to 
2000 calories per day, and if the body is being wasted by 
disease, he may need a great deal more. During conva- 
lescence, if the body has lost weight, food must be given 
for rebuilding, in addition to the ordinary daily need. 

Temperature of Food. The temperature of the food served 
is exceedingly important, as it has a marked influence upon 
digestion. As a rule, foods to be served "hot" should 
aeither be served lukewarm nor too hot. Serve in hot dishes 
and cover in transit. Cold food should be served neither 
lukewarm nor ice cold. Under many conditions food at ex- 
treme temperatures interferes with digestion and absorption. 

Details in Feeding. The patiqnt should be saved from 
thinking as well as from physical exertion, and it is unwise 
to ask him what he would like to eat, for it is often the un- 
expected that pleases. Personal idiosyncrasies should be con- 
sidered; for some foods easy of digestion, if repugnant to 
the patient, may prove nauseating and be rejected or disturb 
digestion. 

Only a small quantity of food should be given at one time 
so that the digestive organs may not be overtaxed. It is 
much better to do this often than to give too much at one 
time. A tablespoonful of nourishment every half hour may 



FEEDING THE SICK 77 

be retained and digested, and do the patient good, when if 
a larger amount "were given the stomach would reject it. 

The majority of weak patients are unable to take food of 
any solid kind before eleven o'clock in the morning, yet 
before that time comes they are apt to become exhausted. 
This would not be likely to occur if a spoonful of some liquid 
nourishment or stimulant ordered by the physician were given 
every hour or two, from the early morning up to the time 
for taking the solid food, which the patient would then 
probably be able to do by noon. 

All noise in the preparation of food and smell of cook- 
ing should be kept from the sick room. The nurse should 
never eat her meal or taste the patient's food in his presence, 
and should always have a cheerful manner and a cleanly, 
tidy appearance. These things have much eflect upon the 
patient's appetite. 

Bathing and Cleansing the Mouth. When possible, it is 
well to bathe the patient's face and hands before offering a 
meal. The mouth should be rinsed each time after eating 
with pure water, or diluted borax water (two teaspoonfuls 
to a tumbler of water). This takes away the after-taste of 
the food and he is less apt to tire of it. 

The mouth should be kept thoroughly cleansed, for if the 
lips are allowed to become parched and sour, the patient will 
refuse nourishment which he might otherwise take. When a 
patient cannot rinse his own mouth it must be frequently 
cleansed by the nurse with a swab of fresh cotton, fastened to 
a small flexible stick. A tongue scraper made of a whale- 
bone bent to a loop may be used before serving the food; 
thus the taste nerves will be uncovered and the appetite im- 
proved. 

Time and Position for Feeding, When the patient is first 
allowed to sit up for half an hour, it is well to utilize this 
time for giving the principal meal of the day, which is likely 
to be eaten with more relish, and perhaps better digested in 
consequence. If the patient is only allowed to sit partially 
up in bed, the nurse should see that the position is com- 



78 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

fortable, and that the food tray does not cramp the arms and 
legs, taking care that no crumbs get into the bed. 

Sleep and Feeding. The awakening of a patient to take 
nourishment depends upon his need of the nutriment and 
upon his ability to go to sleep again. In serious cases it 
should be given at stated intervals if the patient drops to 
sleep easily after taking it. Some patients, however, are an- 
noyed by being awakened and cannot sleep again. In such 
cases it may be that the sleep will be more beneficial than 
food. 

Feeding the Helpless Patient. The effort of sitting up 
may become fatiguing to the invalid and so destroy his appe- 
tite before the meal is half done, or he may not be able to 
feed himself, or to raise his head. In such cases the diffi- 
culty can be obviated by placing the hand beneath the pillow 
and raising both together gently. 

In feeding fluids at these times always serve in small 
tumbler, not more than two-thirds filled; see that swallows 
are not taken during inspiration, and that each mouthful is 
swallowed before another is offered. In case the head cannot 
be raised, food may be given by means of a glass tube or a 
feeding cup. 

Feeding the Unconscious Patient. The feeding of uncon- 
scious patients demands especial care. They should be given 
only liquid nourishment, and fed with a spoon, or through 
a catheter. If the jaws are set, a medicine dropper may be 
utilized ; not over a teaspoonf ul should be given at once, and 
the nurse must be sure it is swallowed before she gives more. 
In the case of comatose children, or young infants, the nour- 
ishment may be poured into the nostril in place of che mouth. 
Feeding with the stomach tube is sometimes resorted to, when 
nasal feeding is not feasible. 

Forced Feeding. Forced feeding consists in introducing 
various liquid foods, as milk, eggs, meat-juice or extracts 
into the stomach by way of the nose or directly through the 
mouth by means of a stomach tube. This is seldom required 
of the nurse, but is usually done by the physician himself. 



FEEDING TEE SICK 79 

This method is employed when the unconscious patient expe- 
riences difficulty in swallowing ; in gastric irritability ; when 
a patient is unable to take sufficient food, owing to loss of 
appetite and disgust for food; and also in case of a refrac- 
tory patient who refuses to eat. 

y'asal Feeding. In nasal feeding a nasal tube is em- 
ployed or in case of infant a catheter. Have either well 
oiled and passed gently through the nose into the oesophagus 
and then into the stomach. Before pouring in the food wait 
a moment to see that the tube has not entered the larynx. 

Use of the Stomach Tube. The jaws must be kept open. 
In children without teeth, the finger may be employed; in 
grown persons a mouth gag or a roller bandage may be held 
between the teeth. The tube should be moistened, passed 
into the pharynx and thence rapidly into the stomach. If 
these two precautions are not observed, contraction of the 
muscles may occur, preventing the tube from entering the 
oesophagus. In passing the tube into the oesophagus, hold 
it well back from the end. When the tube is satisfactorily 
introduced, place a funnel in the free end and pour liquid 
nourishment slowly down the side of the funnel until the 
tube is filled, and the air in tube is expelled; this care pre- 
vents the air in tube entering the stomach. In removing the 
tube, it should be withdrawn rapidly in order not to excite 
vomiting. In some cases the physician orders the stomach 
washed out before introducing the food. When it is neces- 
sary to take special precautions to prevent regurgitation of 
the food, the ribs may be tickled to prevent contraction of 
the diaphragm. 

Rectal Feeding. This form of alimentation is necessary 
when the stomach cannot retain food. It is based on the fact 
that the rectal mucous membrane, while it possesses no di- 
gestive faculty, is able to absorb certain classes of nutriment. 
These include among the carbohydrates, sugars; among pro- 
teins, the native albumin as well as the end products of pro- 
tein digestion. The latter are believed to be much more 
absorbable than the first products (albumoses and peptones). 



80 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

Soluble starch (dextrin) is doubtless absorbable, but un- 
changed starch and fats can hardly be taken up. It is prob- 
able that finely emulsified fats if thrown well up into the 
colon are absorbable to some extent. Although we cannot 
understand why certain substances nourish the patient, since 
they are theoretically not absorbable, they seem in some man- 
ner to be utilized, even when merely thrown into the rectum. 
As far as possible we should employ substances which we 
know positively to be capable of absorption; but in rectal 
feeding for a long period it is sometimes necessary to use a 
great variety of formula, making it out of the question to 
confine ourselves to the few articles which are theoretically 
best suited for the purpose. 

The rectum may be intolerant to almost any form of enema ; 
even if retained for some time, it may be rejected without 
apparent change. Under the most favorable circumstances, 
at least three-fourths, of the quantity injected will come 
away with the regular evacuation of the bowels. The amount 
of energy actually supplied must be far below the theoretical 
demands of the body. In some cases, it is of course possible 
to nourish the patient partly by the mouth and partly by 
rubbing a small amount of fatty matter into the skin. Some 
of the most available substances, such as solutions of sugar, 
are naturally irritating to the rectum. 

It is possible to keep a patient alive for weeks and even 
months by rectal feeding, but in many cases this resource for 
one reason or another fails outright to do what is expected of 
it. Hence we cannot be too careful as to technique and 
choice .of material used. Of natural substances, milk and 
eggs have been very freely used. The albumin and sugar in 
the milk are probably utilized. In an emulsion of eggs, the 
native albumin is doubtless the constituent which nourishes 
the patient. "We cannot be sure of the absorption of the 
fatty matter of the milk and eggs. Both these substances are 
relatively non-irritating. Peptonized milk answers well in 
some cases. It is best to carry on the peptonization for a 
long period, until the end products of digestion form, pep- 



FEEDiyG THE SICK 81 

tones themselves being ofteu irritating. Solutions of glucose 
and dextrin are useful, alone or combined with other in- 
gredients. For example, eggs may be combined with glucose, 
or plain milk with dextrin. For variety, any of the pre- 
digested foods, whether these come in solution or dried, and 
even bouillon and beef-tea may be tried. Starch emulsion 
is soothing in the rectum and may be utilized if first mixed 
with diastase. 

The technique is most important. The rectum should 
first be cleaned by a high injection of decinormal saline 
solution, after which no attempt should be made to give a 
nourishing injection for at least an hour. It may be neces- 
sary for the physician to treat the rectum if hemorrhoids or 
great irritability exists. The patient's hips should be raised 
higher than the head to aid in retaining the enema. A tube 
specially designed for the purpose should be used, the enema 
being at body heat and allowed to flow in by gravity from 
a funnel. The amount injected should never exceed 8 oz. 
and the enema cannot be repeated oftener than every 6 
hours unless the quantity is small. As a rule, the smaller the 
enema the more frequently it may be used. After an injec- 
tion the patient should be kept perfectly quiet. 

Stimulants like black coffee and whisky are often given by 
the rectum, the whisky requiring dilution with two parts 
water. Wine is sometimes used for the purpose. Stimulat- 
ing and nutritive enemata may be combined. 

Injections of normal salt solution, seltzer water, etc., are 
sometimes used to supply the body with fluids and quench 
thirst. 

Useful additions to enemata comprise a little salt or sodium 
bicarbonate or a little starch emulsion; at times a few drops 
of laudanum are of value in aiding retention. 

One should not be discouraged by early failure, as it is 
possible for tolerance to be established.

Use of Alcohol in the Sick Room. The nurse may be re- 
quired to exercise her own judgment at times in the emer- 
gency use of alcoholics in the sick room. This necessity is 
most likely to occur with those patients having incurable 
maladies where the question of harm to the organism or to 
the morals of the individual does not come into consideration. 
Consumptives often show a remarkable tolerance to alcohol, 
and receive a notable stimulating effect from it, and it 
sometimes happens that an eggnog or milk punch will enable 
an advanced consumptive to dress and make his toilet in the 
morning when otherwise he would have to lie in bed. This 
is true to a less extent of some other incurable diseases. 
Severe acute or subacute conditions in which an alcoholic 
stimulant might require to be given in preference to any 
other for its emergency effect in averting unlooked-for cardiac 
failure comprise pyemia, septicemia and diphtheria. In the 
same class belong certain cases of acute poisoning due to 
mistakes or suicidal intent, such as those due to aconite and 
similar heart poisons. The propriety of giving alcoholics 
after simple collapse or syncope when no serious disease is 
present depends upon the nature of the case and whether 
other stimulants are available. 

Alcohol should perhaps never be given even in emergencies 
to subjects with neuroses or insanity or to victims of severe 
disease of the gastrointestinal organs. 

Keeping Ice in the Sich Room. The very best plan is to 
have a small refrigerator or a Japanese ice box, which may 
be had for a few dollars. If these little luxuries are im- 
possible, put the ice in a deep bowl, cover it with a plate, 
and place the bowl between two clean feather pillows. An- 
other simple way of keeping ice is to put it in a dish pan, 
cover with a tin lid, and wrap in flannel cloths and news- 
papers. It will keep a long time, as feathers, wool and 
paper are poor conductors of heat.

Disinfecting Utensils. All dishes or utensils used in the 
sick room should be disinfected before being sent to the 
kitchen to be washed. A simple method is to scrape them 
clean and dip them in a basin of borax water (a teaspoonful 
of borax in a shallow bowl of water). In case of infectious 
diseases all dishes and utensils should be boiled in water 
containing 3 per cent, of sodium bicarbonate for one-half an 
hour to one hour. 



CHAPTER Y 
THE TRAY 

The writer's intention is only to suggest to the nurse the 
best and simplest methods of arranging the tray and a few 
of the important details. 

These things seem trivial, but it must be remembered that 
the horizon of the sick room is limited, and that the patient 
who has long been confined to bed with a serious illness thinks 
much of his immediate surroundings. 

He may seem too ill to notice these details, whereas he is 
only too ill to speak of them, for one feeds with the eyes quite 
as much as with the lips, and by some carelessness of the 
nurse the appetite of a refined, fastidious, or nervous pa- 
tient may be wholly destroyed. 

While the natural stimulants to appetite, such as fresh 
air, exercise and enlivening companionship, are necessarily 
wanting, the taking of food is the chief event of the day, 
and too much care cannot be bestowed upon its preparation 
and service, as, has been said, the appearance and manner of 
offering have much to do with its acceptance or rejection. 

ATTRACTIVE ARRANGEMENT OF A TRAY 

The cover and the arrangement of the tray is of the ut- 
most importance, and the slightest departure from regularity 
and immaculate cleanliness should be avoided. 

The tray should be covered with fine linen damask, with- 
out crease or wrinkle — the best you can afford. Use the 
choicest silver, daintiest china and glassware; arrange neatly 
and conveniently. Place a single rose or flower on the tray ; 
a quotation, added as a variety, will often attract the atten- 
tion, and it is well, when possible, to divert the patient's 

85 



86 



PRACTICAL DIETETICS 



mind from his ailments while eating. This can easily be 
done in these little ways, and also by the introduction of 
some cheerful and interesting topic of conversation.

tumblers placed right side up. 

How to Serve. (General Eules.) The time of cooking 
food to be served, should be carefully considered in relation 



TEE TRAY 87 

to the time of serving, for most palatable food may be 
spoiled by not serving it at the proper time. 

Avoid serving too many things on tray. Cover tray with a 
clean napkin or tray cover in carrying it to its destination. 
"When the dietary ordered is very limited in variety, the pa- 
tient is often gratified by having his food served in courses, 
and will eat more than if given everything at once. 

Only a small quantity should be served at one time. If 
possible, taste of all food and drinks before serving, to see 
if properly seasoned and at right temperature to serve. 

Always use separate spoon for tasting. 

Food to be served hot, should be served hot (not luke- 
warm), in heated dishes and covered in transit. 

Cold drinks and fruits are more healthful when served 
cool than ice-cold. 

Wlien fluid foods are to be given, other receptacles should 
be used than those used for medicine, or the association of 
ideas may be strong enough to destroy what little appetite 
the patient has, and to even produce nausea. Do not fill 
cups or glasses full, but within one inch of the top. For 
individual dishes, for a luncheon, or drinks to be passed 
alone, use a small tray or plate, covered with a doily or 
folded napkin. 

The finger-bowl should be placed on a small plate, cov- 
ered with a dainty doily; fill one-fourth full of water, and 
put a few rose petals or green leaves in the water and on the 
side of the plate. 

When possible, cover all foods and drinks left standing in 
the sick room. 

The tray and all traces of a meal should be removed im- 
mediately after eating. Half-emptied cups or glasses should 
never be left in the room. 

If the patient is restricted to any especial diet, vary as 
far as possible in the preparation and serving. 

The diet of the patient should be under the supervision 
of the physician, and his directions followed implicitly, for 
much unnecessary suffering, and even death, has been the 
result of giving forbidden food. 



CHAPTER VI 
METHODS OP COOKING AND CARE OF FOOD 

Cooking is the preparation of food for eating. 

Digestibility and Xutritive Value of cooked food depends 
to a considerable extent upon the manner in which it is 
cooked and served. The time and temperature of cooking 
should be carefully considered, in relation to the constituents 
of the food material. 

Success in Cooking depends in part upon the qualit}^ of 
material used, which should be the best. The measurements 
must be accurate. Care should be exercised in combining 
ingredients and one should know the effect of various modes 
of cooking on the food under consideration. Training and 
experience are necessary for success. 

Objective Points in Cooking: 

1. To improve the flavor of food, or render it more pal- 
atable. ^ 

2. To soften it that it may be more readily masticated and 
digested. 

3. To produce chemical changes which increase digestibil° 
ity. 

4. To destroy bacteria and parasites which may be pres- 
ent in raw food. 

Effects of Heat. Protein is coagulated by hot water and 
dry heat ; cold water dissolves soluble proteins, especially if a 
little salt is present. 

Starch is converted into dextrin by dry heat at a tempera- 
ture of 320° F. ; the starch granules dissolve when subjected 
to boiling water ; cold water separates starch grains. 

88 



METHODS OF COOKING AND CARE OF FOOD 8i) 

Sugars are changed to caramel at a high temperature. 

Fats are readily decomposed by heat, with production of 
free fatty acids. 

Principles Governing the Choice of a Method of Cooking 
Any Food. These include: (1) A knowledge of the effects 
of heat and moisture on the digestibility of the articles to be 
cooked. (2) The relation of the method to the extraction of 
soluble portions of the food materials. 

Principal Cooking Processes: 

1. Boiling is cooking in boiling water (212° F.). Gentle 
boiling is as effective as rapid, and prevents waste of fuel if 
gas is used. 

2. Stewing is long, slow cooking in water below the boil- 
ing point— 186° F. 

3. Steaming is cooking in heat derived from the vapor of 
boiling water. In using the Savory Double Boiler the steam 
enters the cooking compartment and comes into contact with 
the food cooked, keeping it at a constant temperature 212° F. 

4. Broiling is cooking over a glowing fire or over or un- 
der a flame. Pan broiling is cooking meat in a very hot 
frying-pan without fat, turning the meat often. 

5. Baking is cooking in an oven by means of heated air. 
Eoasting is cooking before a glowing fire (direct heat). 

6. Frying is cooking in a deep bath of hot fat (tempera- 
ture ranging from 350° to 400° F.). 

Other methods are used which differ but slightly from the 
above. Braizing is a combination of stewing and baking; 
fricasseeing of frying and stewing. 

The Object of Each Cooking Process: 

1. To retain the juice as in boiling, steaming, broiling, bak- 
ing, roasting, frying. 

2. To extract the juices as in soups. 

3. Partly to retain and partly to extract the juices as in 
stews, chowders, braising, and fricasseeing. 

Cooking Utensils. A nurse should always have at hand a 
standard measuring cup, divided into thirds and fourths. 
Wooden spoons are preferable to metal ones for mixing and 



90 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

stirring, as metal spoons are too hard and may break off 
bits of enamel, and are also acted upon by acids. For beating 
egg-white, a spoon-shaped wire beater should be used; for 
the yolks, a fork or Dover egg beater is preferable. Use 
round bottom utensils when stirring is necessary during the 
cooking. Use earthen bowl and wooden spoons for mixing 
batters, etc. A double boiler should be used when cooking 
any food that burns easily (as milk) ; also when foods are to 
be cooked at low temperatures. 

Blending Ingredients. There are several wavs of accom- 
plishing this purpose. 

1. Stirring. This is simple mechanical mixing in which 
a mass of ingredients is made uniform. 

2. Beating or whipping consists in so manipulating a soft 
mixture as to incorporate the air. A spoon or special device 
IS so applied that the bottom of the mixture is steadily lifted 
to the top. 

3. Folding-in is a term applied to the method of intro- 
ducing beaten white of egg slowly and gently into a soft 
mass, so as to render it light, the air being retained. 

4. Cutting is used only in making pastry. Two knives are 
worked in opposite directions until the shortening is well 
incorporated in the flour. 

Suggestions as to Methods of Working. If a fire and oven 
are to be used these must be first of all attended to that they 
be m readiness when needed. All the cooking apparatus 
should be laid out and the materials to be cooked measured 
m preparations for mixing. It is advisable to be economical 
m the use of utensils. Thus one measuring cup may some- 
times be used in succession for dry materials, liquids and 
fats, m the order named. A receptacle should be at hand 
for soiled spoons and other utensils employed in measuring 
or mixing. It is desirable to work as much as possible in a 
small space; thus the measuring and mixing should be done 
on a single table if possible. All soiled dishes should be put 
to soak; at odd moments they may be washed, dried and put 
away. The purpose underlying these principles is that the 



METHODS OF COOKIXG AXD CARE OF FOOD 91 

nurse may go into the family kitchen and prepare food for 
the patient without in the least interfering with the regular 
kitchen work of the household. 

Ice Box and Contents. The ice box should be maintained 
in a state of absolute cleanliness. This is not dilficult in 
the case of a simple portable refrigerator without a drain 
pipe, which may be flushed out daily with boiling water con- 
taining borax or ammonia (half ounce to the gallon). How- 
ever, in the larger kinds of portable refrigerators, and in the 
set ice boxes where a tube is necessary for drainage, all the 
compartments and shelves should be washed with soap and 
hot water at least once in a week, while every day loose par- 
ticles of food which have escaped from dishes, etc., should 
be carefully removed; or if advisable in certain cases, the food 
and shelves may be removed and wiped or brushed off. The 
drainage pipes must be cleaned with a brush made for the 
purpose at least once a week. It is advisable to sprinkle 
borax on the shelves after cleaning. Certain pungent articles 
can not be kept in an ice box without flavoring other foods 
such as butter, milk, etc. 

Institutions, if large enough, may use a refrigerating plant, 
which does away in part with the handling of ice; or by the 
aid of an ice machine, superintendents may assure them- 
selves of the purity of all ice designed for internal use. 

The drain pipe of an ice box should not, for obvious rea- 
sons, communicate with the sewerage system. 

The temperature in the food compartments is sometimes 
much warmer than one would imagine; and it is desirable 
to get some idea of what the temperature fluctuations are by 
using a thermometer. The reading can hardly go lower than 
40° F. and should not be over 60° F. 

The ice cake should be wrapped in cloth or paper, not only 
for economy's sake but because it may be dirty inside or out- 
side. Xo food should be placed in the box while warm, for 
the sudden cooling may set up undesirable changes. Canned 
food should not be placed on ice in the opened can, but in a 
fresh receptacle. When possible, each article should be 



93 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

placed in a separate container, or wrapped in paper. Mois- 
ture in the ice box, while unavoidable, should be kept down 
by wiping walls and shelves dry at intervals. 

CARE OF FOOD i 

The care of food between the time of purchase and cooking, 
and that of cooking and serving is highly important. The 
fact that spoiled food represents an economic loss, important 
as it is, is much less significant than the fact that not only 
spoiled food, but good food which is contaminated with germ 
life, is a possible source of disease. 

Exposed food, i. e., food exposed to dust, insects, etc., be- 
comes contaminated with disease germs without necessarily 
becoming spoiled or in any way offensive to the senses. The 
most crisp salad or luscious fruit may be covered with dan- 
gerous microorganisms. 

By far the most frequent and abundant forms of micro- 
organisms, which grow at such rate as quickly to become vis- 
ible to the naked eye, are molds. These are not on the whole 
harmful to man, and their chief significance is that they give 
to foods a bad flavor and cause a certain amount of decompo- 
sition. These organisms attack food which is stored in dark, 
damp places, chiefly cellars, and although themselves gen- 
erally harmless, they are likely to be associated with poisonous 
bacteria. Certain butchers hang steaks until they become 
covered with mold, but the mold does not make the meat ten- 
der and highly flavored, for these changes are due largely 
to the bacteria of putrefaction which are also present, tliriv- 
ing under the same conditions as does the mold. 

In case of substances which have a natural protective cov- 
ering, it is highly important that this should not be broken 
in handling. Thus when fruits and vegetables are bruised, 
the pulp is quickJy attacked by microorganisms and local 
changes occur, resulting in economic waste, since such articles 
can only be partly utilized.

Bulletin, Xo. 375 U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 



METHODS OF COOKIXG AXD CARE OF FOOD 93 

Foods should therefore be stored in places which admit 
plenty of sunlight and air, which will antagonize the growth 
of molds and putrefactive bacteria. Ice, by producing tem- 
peratures unfavorable for the growth of microorganisms, is 
a valuable aid in this sort of cleanliness. Some use of soap 
and water is necessary, but the benefits are partly lost if the 
shelves, etc., are left damp. In cellars repeated whitewashing 
is the most available resource for cleanliness. 

Food should be bought in the freshest and cleanest state, 
should be placed in clean containers, and handled with clean 
hands. Foods should always be washed if there is any suspi- 
cion of contamination. The cases of violent cholera morbus 
which often follow the use of unripe apples, and even of ripe 
fruit like cherries, are believed to be due not to the irritating 
acids present in fruit, but to the presence of a well-known 
bacterium mingled with the dust which collects on such fruit. 
To be absolutely on the safe side, all fruits and vegetables 
should be eaten cooked, but this would deprive us of salads 
and fresh fruits and berries which form so large and pleas- 
urable a part of the average dietary. It has been found by 
experience that if celery, greens, asparagus, berries, etc., are 
washed repeatedly in cool or tepid water, they can at last 
become quite clean without losing their delicate flavor and 
consistency. As long as a particle of grit is present there is 
of course possibility of contamination by living organisms. 
They should be washed, therefore, until the wash water is 
clear. This is a rule which applies to all food that is to 
be eaten raw. With cooking such caution is not absolutely 
necessary. .Potatoes, etc., are washed before boiling for 
esthetic reasons only. 

The worst cases of food poisoning, known as ptomaine 
poisoning, are mysterious in character, and are not entirely 
preventable. Chemical substances not usually formed in sim- 
ple decomposition are responsible. They may be present alike 
in raw, cooked, or frozen foods, and in fresh and preserved 
foods. In some cases there is abundant evidence of extreme 
decomposition. The use of rotten eggs in cookery by bakers 



94 PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

has caused severe ptomaine poisoning. Cold storage meats 
are sometimes responsible. Fish poisoning, especially with 
shell fish, may be due to some unknown disease of the ani- 
ma.s themselves (although fish very readily undergo decom- 
position), and personal susceptibility is often a factor The 
numerous cases of ice cream poisoning are usually due to 
mistakes of amateurs who do not understand the proper re- 
quirements of the art. Although we do not understand and 
cannot a «^ys foresee ptomaine poisoning, it is the more 
important that no step be neglected which will contribute in 
theory to securing clean food. Most cases occur in prolonged 
warm weather in which decomposition is favored. Sound 
Iresh food, thoroughly cooked and eaten at once could hardly 
cause ptomaine poisoning under any conditions 

The articles which the ordmary careful nurse must think 
o± m this connection are preserved foods of all kinds shell 
fish, and milk products, the latter being of most significance 
because milk, fresh cream, ice cream, etc., are often given 
freely to invalids The care of milk, drinking water and 
other kinds of food is considered elsewhere. 

Special care of food in respect to fly pollution has become 
necessary since we have learned of the part played by this 
insect in causing typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, etc. Both 
the feet and the excrement of flies are sources of contamina- 
tion. Dealers in food-stuffs in the main take but little pains 
against protecting their wares from fly contamination Cook- 
ing and careful washing of food to be eaten raw, are our 
principal safeguards in respect to food as it reaches the house 
There is the added danger that food when ready for con^ 
sumption will be freshly contaminated. To obviate this 
i.oors and windows of kitchens and dining rooms must be 
properly screened, and flypaper and similar precautions em- 
ployed If typhoid is epidemic in a neighborhood, it is well 
to avoid raw food entirely, just as we avoid unsterilized water 
and milk. Flies are much more likely to abound in neighbor- 
hoods where manure, garbage, etc., are allowed to accunmlate 
and are more dangerous than ordinary dust. ' 



METHODS OF COOKING AND CARE OF FOOD 95 

Dealers usually are at some pains to keep their supplies free 
from dust, though their methods are not always sanitary, 
e. g., the use of the feather duster for fruit. Dust from the 
streets of cities abounds in germ life. Vegetables and cer- 
tain fruits in clusters which cannot be wiped (grapes, cur- 
rants, etc.) are most likely to be dusty. Washing succes- 
sively in a number of waters will usually remove the dust; 
but in the tropics where many diseases are dust-borne it is noi 
considered safe to eat raw grapes at all. "\Miether washing 
is sufficient depends on the character of the dust and the 
degree of exposure to it. 

Preserving Foods. Foods to be preserved should be per- 
fectly fresh. Yeo gives four methods of preservation : 

(1) Drying is the method most available for preserving 
peas, beans, prunes, apricots and other fruits. Milk and eggs 
may both be preserved by desiccation. 

(2) Exclusion of air may be applied in several ways. 
Smoking, which coagulates the outer surface and sterilizes 
it, serves for preserving ham, bacon, fish, etc. Packing in 
sawdust, etc., or dipping in wax preserves eggs. Canning in 
tins or jars under steam heat is used for preserving many 
kinds of food, all air thus being forced out before the can or 
jar is hermetically sealed. 

(3) Freezing and cold storage are used extensively for 
preserving fish, meat, jams, etc. Such foods must be cooked 
immediately upon thawing. 

(4) Antiseptics are used very extensively in food prei?erva- 
tion. The oldest and most widely known of these are salt, 
vinegar, alcohol and syrups. More recently a great variety 
of antiseptic chemicals have been used — benzoate of soda, 
salicylic acid, etc., etc. The advisability of their us.3, even 
in minute quantities, is questionable. 

Concentration. Most foods can be reduced to a dry or 
otherwise condensed state without loss of nutritive value or 
danger of decomposition; and on account of the resulting 
economy in price and storage room may enter into the dietaries 
of hospitals and institutions. Sugar, oil and starch, and 



9G PRACTICAL DIETETICS 

many cereal products, are already in a state of concentration. 
Powdered milk and meat, egg powder, etc., are coming more 
and more into use. Condensed milk has long been a useful 
product (see milk and milk preparations), as have dried and 
evaporated fruits and vegetables. All these products can be 
used in cookery. Their chief use as mainstays will doubtless 
be m cases of temporary shortage of fresh foods due to 
devastating storms, « strikes- and other happenings which 
interrupt traffic. 

Prcdigestion of Food. Much is written against the use of 
predigested foods as a steady diet for the well. Many starchy 
loods on the market are partially digested by heat 1 ■ 
objection seems to rest on the theory that such foods give ' - 
digestive fluids and muscles of the digestive organs notlilug 
io do and that a sort of sluggishness is set up. It cannot 
be said truthfully that these claims have ever been backed 
up by facts. No one denies that thorough mastication is a 
great advantage, and with thorough mastication much of the 
starch IS predigested in the mouth, or, after swallowing, in 
the fundus of the stomach. Predigested proteins are not used 
as staple foods, and as little is gained by very finely masti- 
catmg flesli foods, the stomach has plenty of work in digest- 
ing animal proteins. If there is fat in the diet the pancreas 
can never fall into a state of disuse. Hence the outcry 
against partially predigested breakfast foods does not seem 
justified on this score. It is true, however, that their absence 
ot flavor, and the soft and pulpy character of some of them 
are recogmzed as possible drawbacks; for semi-solid and 
pultaceous foods are difficult to masticate, while their in- 
sipidity does not flavor a flow of digestive -fluids If ad- 
herence to these foods causes sluggish digestion and inability 
to deal with food in more natural condition, one would impute 
this not to prcdigestion, but to the fact that the tastelessness 
and the ease with which they may be bolted, are the real 
factors which bring about a passive state of the diffestivo 
functions. ° 



METHODS OF COOKING AXD CARE OF FOOD 97 

In a diet for the ill, the dyspeptic, the convalescent, etc., 
there can be no possible objection to predigestion ; on the con- 
trary, it is highly desirable up to a certain extent. But just 
as soon as possible the patient should return to foods in the 
natural state, bearing in mind that a small minority of 
patients, even the acutely ill, thrive on food which in theory 
would be hazardous to say the least. Apparently hopeless 
cases of sepsis have seemingly been rescued by placing pa- 
tients on food suited only for the healthy. Such patients 
must, however, have a natural appetite and be able to tolerate 
the food. 

Adulteration of Food. " Since the passage of the National 
Pure Food and Drugs Act, giving to the United States Gov- 
ernment authority to enforce stringent laws against the adul- 
teration and misbranding of foods which enter into inter- 
state commerce, and the more rigid enforcement of similar 
state laws which regulate these matters in many of the states, 
a great burden has been lifted from the shoulders of the buyer. 
This legislation has enormously decreased the deceptions 
formerly practiced by some manufacturers, and since it in- 
sures that tJie name and description on bottle and package 
shall not misrepresent the contents, the buyer, if he knows 
what he wants, will have no difl&culty in obtaining it, while 
the honest manufacturers and dealers (and they have with- 
out doubt always outnumbered the others) will also be pro- 
tected. This matter in its various aspects is taken up in 
publications of the Bureau of Chemistry ^ of this Depart- 
ment." - For Table of Common Adulteration of Food- 
stuffs, note Farmer's Bulletin Xo. 25, of the United States

MEASUEES AND WEIGHTS 

Accurate measurement is necessary to insure success in 
cooking. 

All dry ingredients, such as flour, meal, confectioners' or 
powdered sugar, should be sifted before measuring. 

Mustard, cream of tartar, soda, and salt should be stirred 
before measuring, to lighten and free from lumps. 




A Standard Measuring: Cup 

"^A standard measuring cup contains one-half pint and is 
'divided into fourths and thirds. 

To measure a cupful of dry material, put in the ingredients 
by spoonfuls, round slightly and level with back of case- 
knife, being careful not to shake cup. 

A cupful is measured level with the brim. 

A heaping cupful is measured level, with two table spoon- 
fuls extra added. 

A scant cupful is measured level, with two table spoonfuls 
taken out. 

All ingredients measured hy the tablespoon or teaspoon are 
measured level. 

To measure a spoonful, fill the spoon and level it off with 
the back of case-knife.

To measure a half-spoonful, first measure a spoonful and 
then cut it in halves, lengthwise. 

To measure a quarter-spoonful, measure a half-spoonful 
and divide it into half, crosswise, allowing a little more for 
tip of spoon. 

A saltspoon is one-fourth of a level teaspoon. 

A speck is a little less than one-eighth of a teaspoon. 

To measure butter, lard, and other solid fats, pack solidly 
into spoon or cup and level with knife. 

When recipe calls for one tablespoon (or so) of hutter 
melted, measure before m£lting. WTien recipe calls for one 
tablespoon (or so) of melted butter, measure after melting.

METRIC SYSTEM 

For the origin and underlying principles of the metric 
system consult any modern arithmetic (Milne's Standard, for 
example). The nurse should know the metric tables and the 
equivalents between the metric and common systems for meas- 
ures of volume and weight. She does not require linear and 
square measure, nor measures of capacity except in a few 
instances. 

The subjoined tables and equivalents will suflBce. 

TABLES 
Measures of Voltime 

In measuring small quantities the cubic centimeter is the 
anit. 

1 cubic centimeter = 1.0 cc. 

10 cubic centimeters = 10.00 cc. 

1 cubic millimeter = 0.1 cc.

MEASURES OF WEIGHT 

In measures of weight the gram is the unit.

THERMOMETRY 

The thermometers used by the nurse in cookery, in reffu- 
Jatmg the heat of the room or in taking the patient's tempera- 
tures are chiefly of the Fahrenheit scale. Scientists enfploy 
the Centigrade scale in most countries. While thermometers 
are made with both scales, it is a simple matter to translate 
the ordinary Fahrenheit to Centigrade. 

The freezing point of the lattei is 0°, while that of the 
former is 32° above 0. 

The boiling point of the latter is 100°, while that of the 
former is 212°. 

.o?f ' o^o?^°^' Fahrenlieit to Centigrade, we subtract 
32 from 212 m order that the freezing points correspond, 
which leaves 180° F.= 100° C. A degree Centigrade is 
therefore o/9 of a degree Fahrenheit. 

To change Centigrade to Fahrenheit, every Fahrenheit de- 
gree IS 9/5 times as large as a Centigrade degree. It is also 
necessary to add 32° to the result. 

Examples: Change 212° Fahrenheit to Centiarade 
212°— 32°=: 180° X 5-9 = 100° C. 
Change 100° Centrigrade to Fahrenheit. 
100° X 9-5 = 180° + 32° = 212° F.

ACID — ALBUMINOTIS — STARCHY — MISCELLANEOUS BEVER- 
AGES, INCLUDING TEA, COFFEE, CHOCOLATE, AND COCOA, 
AND SPECIAL NON-NUTRITIVE BEVERAGES 

Beverages serve primarily to relieve thirst. The universal 
beverage is water.^ Other beverages answer the same pur- 
pose, because their chief constituent is water. They are also 
taken for their temperature — cold or hot; for their flavor, 
which helps to arouse or appease the appetite; or for their 
stimulating properties. Usually they have little or no energy 
value, but when made with milk, eggs, cocoa, chocolate or 
other highly nutritive materials, they become a valuable 
means of administering food in a liquid form. 

All beverages need to be made with much care and served 
daintily. Hot drinks should be served at a temperature of 
122-140° F. When water is used it should be freshly 
drawn, brought to a boil and drank at once. This serves to 
sterilize it and also to develop a better flavor. 

Cold drinks should be given thoroughly cooled, but iced 
liquids lower the temperature of the stomach unless sipped 
very slowly, and thus tend to retard digestion. They are 
therefore better for serving between meals than with them. 
Do not use ice in a beverage unless it is made from pure water, 
but cool by placing the receptacle on ice. Use a separate 
spoon, and taste every beverage just before serving to be sure 
it is properly seasoned and of correct temperature. 

Never allow a drink to stand any length of time in a sick 
room. If it has to be carried any distance, be sure that it 
is covered.

ACID BEVERAGES 



_ Beverages made from fruit Juices are cooling and refresh- 
mg, and hence especially grateful to fever patients Thev 
are valuable for the organic acids, mineral matter, and sugar 
which they contain. Some of them, as lemonade and orange- 
ade, have an added value in their diuretic and diaphoretic 
action The organic acids are useful in constipation, as they 
stimulate peristaltic action. These acids vary with the kind 
ot truit; thus, apples contain malic acid; lemons, citric acid- 
grapes, tartanc acid etc. These acids, as elsewhere stated,^^ 
occur in the form of acid salts, usually of potassium, and in 
ifn. Jr\^ T^^^° carbonates, which preserve the alka-

ALBUMINOUS BEVERAGES 

Albuminous or albuminized beverages are combinations of 
egg with water, milk, fruit juices and other fluids decent 
studies bj Bateman ^ show that, contrary to general opinion, 
raw egg white is not well digested. Hence the energy value 
o± such drmks is not as high as might be expected from the 
composition of egg white. Cooking coagulates the albumin 

.? T^T f 5rf ""^"^ '""^'^ digestible. (See experiment on 
the ±.ttect of lemperature on Albumin, page 17.) 
, Egg yolk, on the other hand, is easily digested raw Since 
It contains about thirty per cent, of fat, the volk has a 
much higher fuel value than the white. In cases where the 
patient's ability to digest fat is disturbed, egg yolk should be 
given with caution. The combination of egg, milk and sugar 
with alcohol which constitutes egg-nog may produce nausea 
and vomiting m a feeble stomach, especially in fever Egcr. 
nog is very nutritious and is extensively prescribed in certafn 
non-febrile diseases, especially for forced feeding in phthisis 
and melancholia. 

Albuminous drinks are most easily prepared cold. When 
a hot liquid IS used, it must be poured verv slowly into the 
well beaten egg, stirring constantly, so that lumps of coagu- 
lated albumin do not form. 

For the Diabetic. Sugar must be replaced by sweetina or 
saccharin. It is many times sweeter than sugar"but it has no 
food value. Note Sugar Substitutes, page 249.

STARCHY BEVERAGES 

Starchy drinks consist of cereals or cereal products, cooked 
thoroughly in a large amount of water and strained before 
serving. Arrowroot, cornstarch, tapioca, rice and rice flour 
are nearly pure starch. Oats, barley and wheat in forms 
which include the whole grains contain besides starch some 
protein and fat, and also valuable mineral matter, especially 
phosphorus, iron, and calcium saJts.^ In starchy drinks, 
these ingredients are necessarily present in small amounts; 
hence they have little food value, unless milk or other 
highly nutritive material is added. Such drinks are of value 
when only a small quantity of nutriment can be taken. 

Principles of Cooking. As the chief ingredient is starch, 
long cooking is necessary, in water at a high temperature 
(212° F.), which softens the cellulose, and breaks open the 
starch grains, so that it can be very readily digested. Time 
of cooking should be conscientiously kept by the clock. 

Digestion. The action of ptyalin is very rapid, and if these 
drinks are sipped slowly, so as to be thoroughly mixed with 
saliva, a considerable portion of starch may be changed to 
sugar before reaching the intestines. 

For the Diabetic. Sugar must be replaced by sweetina or 
saccharin. It is many times sweeter than sugar but it has no 
food value. Note Sugar Substitutes, page 249. 

BARLEY WATER, 180 CALORIES

Strain through muslin. 

Note. — Cream or milk and salt may be added, or lemon 
juice and sugar. Barley water is an astringent or demulcent 
drink used to reduce laxative condition.

TRITIVE BEVERAGES 

TEA 

Source. The tea of commerce is prepared from the leaves 

of a shrub cultivated for this purpose in China, Japan India, 

Ceylon, and other portions of Southern and Eastern Asia. 

Classes of Tea. There are two great classes of tea the 
green' and the black. The difference lies in the mode of 
preparation. Green teas are quickly dried and fired; black 
teas are allowed to ferment a few hours before drymg and 

firing. p n 1 T+ 

Active Principles of Tea. Tea has no food value. Is 
principal constituents are caffein, tannic acid, and a volatile 

"'its flavor is due to the volatile oil; its f niulating prop- 
erties to the cafiein. Tannic acid is a soluble, bitter sub- 
stance, which has a retarding effect on digestion. 

When tea leaves are placed in boiling water caffem s ex- 
tracted very rapidly. Tannic acid is less soluble, and there- 
fore it is possible to make tea with little of this principle by 
letting the water stand on the leaves only a short time. In 



12S BEVERAGES 

practice, the hot, but not boiling water, should stand on the 
tea from 3 to 5 minutes. The water should be soft, as 
lime m hard water tends to make tannin dissolve more freely 
Green or mixed tea is more powerful than black tea 

Effects of Tea. Tea is mildly stimulating and hence re- 
treshmg, as it removes the sense of bodily fatigue. But the 
tannic acid retards the digestive action of the saliva and ^as^ 
trie juice, and tends to produce constipation. Tea is there- 
fore not suitable for persons suffering from gastric disorders. 
The caffem is over-stimulating to the nervous system of 
many persons, causing restlessness, sleeplessness and muscular 
tremors It should not be given to children, nor to adults 
with a tendency to nervousness. If you wish to avoid the 
retarding effect of tea on salivary digestion, direct the patient

COFPEE

coffee tree (Caffea arabica), which grows in many warm 
countries, though originally found in Arabia. The coffee 
berry IS about the color and size of a ripe cherry, and con! 
tains two seeds placed face to face 

Active Principles of Coffee. The active principles of cof 
fee are essentially the same as those in tea. By the rottint 
process a volatile oil is liberated (called caffeolfto wh ch hf

system; the heart action is considerably increased in rate 
as well as strength. Indirectly, this results in an increased 
activity of the kidneys. The respiration is deepened and the 
cerebral centers excited. For this reason it often proves use- 
ful in cases of opium and alcoholic poisoning. In some per- 
sons these effects are very mild; in others, they are severe, 
producing nervousness and insomnia, and coffee should then 
bo withheld. It removes the sensation of fatigue, for which 
reason it is used by many nurses when on night duty. It 
sbould never be given to children. 

Coffee or tea taken Avith either milk or sugar alone is much 
more healthful and less likely to cause ill effects than when 
both are used. 

Frequently after operation freshly made black coffee or 
tea without milk or sugar will be retained, and in some cases 
will check vomiting. Give the patient one-half teaspoonful at 
frequent intervals. 

Many preparations have been put upon the market as 

eoffee substitutes, but they lack the aromatic oil and caffein 

for which it is really prized. They make, however, pleasing 

hot beverages, and served with sugar and cream, have a food 

value. 

CHOCOLATE AND COCOA 

Source. Cocoa and chocolate are commercially prepared 
from the seeds of the cacao tree, Theohroma cacao. The seeds 
(or beans) are contained in a pulpy fruit 7-12 inches long, 
3-0 inches in diameter, in shape intermediate between a melon 
and a cucumber. The fruit is gathered and allowed to re- 
main in a heap to ferment a few days, when the pulp becomes 
loosened. The seeds lose some of their bitterness during this 
process, upon which the flavor of the bean largely depends. 
They are then dried in the sun, cleaned and sorted, and care- 
fully roasted. After this the thin outer husks are removed 
and sold under the name of cocoa shells. The broken roasted 
beans constitute cocoa nibs. 

Chocolate is prepared by grinding the nibs between hot 
rollers to a great degree of fineness. The presence of 50 per. 



130 BEVERAGES 

cent, fat causes the mass to form a paste. This is molded 
and cooled with or without the addition of sugar and flavor- 
ing. 

Cocoa consists of chocolate deprived of a part of the fat. 
Sugar or starch or both, are sometimes added. 

Resemblance to Tea and Coffee. Chocolate and cocoa con- 
tain a volatile oil, set free by the fermentation process and 
further modified by roasting, to which the characteristic 
flavor is due. They also contain tannic acid, but in smaller 
amount than in tea or coffee. The stimulating principle 
of chocolate and cocoa is an alkaloid closely allied to caffein, 
called theobromin. It is less apt to induce nervous symptoms 
than either tea or coffee, but in many persons their stimulat- 
ing power is distinctly felt. 

Nutritive Value. Unlike tea and coffee, chocolate and co- 
coa have a high food value, as shown by the following 
analysis : 

Protein Fat 

Chocolate 12.5% 47.1% 

Breakfast Cocoa 21.6% 28.9% 

By reason of the high percentage of fat, chocolate is likely 
to cause indigestion when used to excess, or when taken in 
addition to an otherwise heavy meal. Cocoa, being less rich 
in fat, is free from this objection. 

The use of cocoa often makes milk acceptable when it 
would otherwise be refused. Hence this beverage is good 
in convalescence, if there are no digestive disturbances. When 
made weak, it can also be given to children in moderation. 

Principles of Cooking. Chocolate and cocoa both contain 
considerable starch, and hence should be boiled to be di- 
gestible. The cooked starch also serves to thicken the bev- 
erage somewhat, and to make it smoother and more homo- 
geneous. On account of the volatile oil to which the flavor 
is due, the cooking should be continued only long enough to 
alter the starch, otherwise the oil is lost.

and let it infuse three to five minutes. By no means allow 
it to boil, for boiling dissipates the aroma and extracts the 
tannin. Strain into hot cup and serve with cream or milk 
and lump sugar, or with sugar and a slice of lemon.

From the percolator take out the cup with its tube, fill the 
percolator with the quantity of water desired, replace cup and 
tube (covering tube with thumb), and put in the coffee, then 
put on the spreader plate and cover. Cook fifteen minutes. 

Note. — If warm or hot water is used it takes less time for 
cooking. Xever use boiling water. It takes a little longer 
with the urns than with the pots. 

When heat is applied to the foot of the pot, a jet of water, 
lukewarm at first, but quickly increasing in temperature as 
the pumping process goes on, is forced up through the tube, 
falling on the spreader plate ; by this, it is evenly distributed 
over the coffee, through which it percolates down into the pot 
again. This pumping continues until the water reaches the 
boiling point, when water and steam together come up 
through the tul)e. The coffee is thus ready to serve.

CHAPTER IX 
ANIMAL FOODS 

The important foods derived from the animal kingdom are 

— Meat — Poultry and Game — Fish — Shell Fish — Eg^s 

— Milk and Milk Products — Sweetbreads — Gelatin — Beef 
Preparations — Meat Broth and Jellies. 

Composition. Milk is the only animal food in which all 
the nutrients are represented in forms and proportions suit- 
able to supply all the needs of the body. It is properly called 
a " complete food." Eggs, also often called " complete food " 
contain both body-building and fuel food-stuffs, but are in- 
complete in the sense that the amount of carbohydrate is so 
small as to be almost negligible. 

Meats are valuable primarily as sources of protein. 'When 
fat is present they are also useful for fuel. 

Meat extracts are chiefly valuable for their flavor and stim- 
ulating properties. 

The Proteins of animal foods are of many forms, con- 
spicuous among which are albumin of egg-white ; myosin of 
•muscle; casein of milk; fibrin of blood; nucleo-protein of 
hver and sweetbreads; collagen of connective tissue. 

The Fats are chiefly mixtures of stearin, palmitin and olein 
m varying proportions; small amounts of esters of volatile 
fatty acids; and compounds of fats with phosphorus in the 
form of lecithin and related substances. 

Extractives. Xitrogenous extractives are found chiefly in 
meat, to which they help to give the characteristic flavor'and 
the stimulating properties. They consist chiefly of purins 
(adenine, guanine, xanthine, hypoxanthine and uric acid) • 
and creatin and creatinin. ' 

Carbohydrates. The carbohydrates are represented mainly 



ANIMAL FOODS 139 

by lactose iu milk, and glycogen in shellfish. As a rule, carbo- 
hydrates are negligible in animal foods. 

Water. Water is present in all animal foods. Some ex- 
amples, showing the varying proportions in different kinds, 
are given in the following table : 

Ch-ster solids 88% 

:^Hlk 87% 

Eggs 11% 

Lean beef ' ^ Z" 

Salt cod 50% 

Mineral Matter. Milk and eggs are more valuable sources 
of ash constituents than any other animal foods. 

Meats are not particularly useful in this respect. They 
are deficient in calcium, and^ while they contain considerable 
iron, it is not in as useful a form as that in eggs or milk. 
Most of the ash constituents found in the body are, however^ 
represented in flesh foods. 

Digestibility. As a class, animal foods are easy of diges- 
tion. They contain little indigestible residue, and the nu- 
trients are almost completely absorbed. Prepared for the ta- 
ble, thev are more concentrated than most vegetable foods. 
Hence animal foods are frequently chosen for invalids and 
convalescents, regardless of their high protein content. 

Disadvantage of a Purely Animal Diet. The chief dis- 
advantages of a purely animal diet are that it does not afford 
sufficient bulk to maintain the proper functioning of the 
alimentary tract, owing to the lack of indigestible residue; 
and that it loads the body with an excess of nitrogenous ma- 
terial, which is not only unnecessary for repair, but may 
cause harm if not speedily eliminated and the elimination of 
which is a strain on the excretory organs. Furthermore, pro- 
tein raises the metabolism so that more food is actually re- 
quired than if carbohydrates and fats are used as fuel. For 
further discussion of the relative merits of animal and veg- 
etable diets, see page 233. 



140 ANIMAL FOODS 

MEAT 

The term meat includes the flesh of all animals used for 
food, as beef, veal, mutton, lamb, pork, poultry and game. 
Lean meat is almost a pure protein food. 

Composition of Meat. 

1. Muscle fibers, composed of proteins, extractives, inor- 
ganic salts and water. 

The principal protein is albumin. Muscle albumin is 
often called myosin. 

The nitrogenous extractives include creatin, creatinin 
and pnrins. (See page 15.) 

The inorganic salts are chiefly those of potassium, 
sodium and magnesium. 

The greater part of the iron is in combination with 
the hemoglobin of the red blood corpuscles. 

2. Connective tissue which binds together the muscle fibers ; 
this consists chiefly of a protein called collagen which 
yields gelatin on boiling. 

3. Fat interspersed between the fibers. 

Nutritive Value. Meat is rich in nitrogenous compounds 
and fats and contains mineral elements which are of value 
to the body. It is easily cooked and improves in flavor during 
the process ; it requires less mastication and is more easilv di*^ 
gested and assimilated than most vegetable food. 

Meat is lacking in carbohydrates and, unless a large amount 
of fat is present, is to be regarded as a source of nitrogen 
rather than of energy. It is to be remembered, however, that 
protein can be burned in the animal body to supply energy. 
(See page 14.) Since protein burns up faster than other 
foods, and very little of the nitrogen can be retained in the 
body, it is most advantageously used in small amounts along 
with plenty of fats and carbohydrates. 

The most important food element in meat is the myosin or 
muscle albumin. The collagen belongs to a group of pro- 
teins often called gelatinoids or albuminoids which, unlike 
the albumins, cannot sustain life alone. They are able, how- 



MEAT 141 

ever, to replace other proteins to the extent of two thirds of 
the ordinarv nitrogen requirement. In young animals, the 
connective tissue is soft and the tissues are easily masticated ; 
but in older animals it becomes very firm, is hard to chew and 
often escapes digestion unless softened or changed to gelatin 
bv cooking. 

'The nitrogenous extractives have no nutritive value, and 
in fact, represent products either of waste (katabolism) or of 
insufficient oxidation. Unless promptly excreted, they may 
cause an excess of uric acid or other disorders. However, 
they bestow upon cooked meat its characteristic flavor and 
odor ; in the stomach, act as stimulants to the secretion of 
gastric juice; and exert on the nervous system a stimulating 
influence similar to that of tea and coffee. 

Diyesiibility of Meat Meat is easily digested, the degree 
of ease dependiog upon the following conditions: (1) The 
age of the animal when killed, with the exception of veal, the 
flesh of the young animal is more easily digested, but less 
nutritious than that of the older one; (2) the time the animal 
is kept before cooking; (3) the sex; (4) the care bestowed on 
the animal during life; (5) the quantity of fat. Lean meat 
is more easily digested than fat meat. 

Absorption of Meat. Meat is very readily absorbed and 
leaves little residue in the intestines; only 3 per cent, of meat 
taken is lost in tiie process of digestion. 

Uncooked Meat. Ordinary raw meat is not quite as easily 
digested as cooked meat. Owing to color and flavor, it is not 
appetizing and could not be taken continuously. However, 
when chopped fine or scraped free from connective tissue, so 
as to be easily attacked by the digestive juices, it is more 
readily digested than cooked meat. 

Effect of Cooking Meat. Proper cooking makes meat more 
digestible, as it softens the connective tissues, thus causing a 
separation of the muscular fibers, and enabling the digestive 
juices to act more advantageously. The color and flavor are 
improved. There is a loss of weight by evaporation of water, 
and loss of mineral matter and some extractives. The loss of 
water concentrates the nutrients, and thus renders cooked 
meat proportionally more nutritious than r-^w meat. 



142 ANIMAL FOODS 

Objective Points and Methods in Cooking: 

1. To letain the juice as in baking, broiling, boiling and 
frying. 

2. To extract the juice as in soups. 

3. To extract and retain the juice as in stews. 

The Principal Constituent of meat to be considered in cook- 
ing is the albumin. Xote page 17, for albumin. 

Cooking of Meat. Heat penetrates meat slowly. At a tem- 
perature of 158 degrees Fahrenheit, the meat assumes a gray 
color, as a result of the decomposition of the coloring matter 
of the blood. At the same time a peculiar odor of cooking 
develops, which is due to chemical changes produced by the 
heat. 

At a temperature above 104 degrees Fahrenheit, meat be- 
gins to lose weight from the separation of water, which con- 
tains salts and nitrogenous extractives. This process contin- 
ues as the temperature rises, except that coagulable proteins 
no longer separate with the water. 

Coagulation of the albumin is an important factor in cook- 
ing meat, and the degree varies with the mode of cooking. 

As broiling is the preferred way of preparing meat for the 
sick and convalescent, it is taken up in detail in this chapter. 

Broiling. In broiling, the meat is to be cooked in its own 
juices ; it is, therefore, evident tliat these must be retained as 
completely as possible. At first the temperature should be 
sufficiently high quickly to coagulate, and even harden the 
albumin on the outside surface, so as to form a layer or pro- 
tecting coat over the whole ; then the heat should be modified 
so that the interior will be raised to a temperature that will 
cook it properly without loss of its nutritive properties. 

In broiling we partially sacrifice the outer layer of the 
meat, to preserve the inner portion. 

The time for exposure will be different for different kinds 
of meat. Beef and mutton require a shorter time than lamb, 
chicken or game. 

A piece of meat properly broiled swells, and when cut, the 



MEAT 143 

liquid portion flows out readily; but if cooked too long the 
albumin inside coagulates and the meat loses its moisture, 
shrinks, and becomes tough. 

Effect of Cold and Hot Water on Meat. Cold water draws 
out the soluble albumin, the extractives and some of the salts ; 
thus in soups, broths and stews where all the nutriment pos- 
sible is desired in the liquid, the meat is first put into cold 
water and gradually brought to a higher temperature. 

Hot water or dry heat coagulates albumin, and since if 
subjected to too high a temperature this becomes tough and 
indigestible, we must note carefully the proper temperature of 
cooking. Often it is necessary to sacrifice a small amount 
of albumin by exposing the meat to a high temperature for 
a short time to form a coating on the meat, in order to re- 
tain the rest of the juices more effectively, after which the 
connective tissue can be softened by gentle simmering for 
several hours. 

The Quality of Meat depends upon the age, sex, environ- 
ment, care, feeding and time of hanging after slaughtering. 
It also depends greatly on the cuts used. 

The tougher and less expensive cuts, if properly cooked, 
are as nutritious and as easily digested as the expensive cuts; 
however, tough meats take long, slow cooking to make them 
palatable, and the fuel used must be taken into consideration 
in the expense. Tough meats are muscles which the animal 
uses the most, as the legs (especially the lower part), neck, 
etc. ; they are more highly flavored on account of the freer 
circulation of blood through these portions. Cuts from the 
neck and shin are used for soups and broths. 

The tenderer and more expensive cuts are from the muscles 
which the animal uses the least, as the upper portion of the 
hind quarter (rump, sirloin) and fore ribs. The circulation 
of blood through these portions is less and they are not as 
juicy and well flavored, nor any more nutritious than tougher 
portions. These tenderer cuts are used for steaks and roasts. 

The remaining muscular portions of the animal (flank, 
shoulder and brisket) are not as tender as the upper portion 



144 ANIMAL FOODS 

of the hind quarter, but just as nutritious. They need longer 
cooking and are used for stews, braising and pot roast. 

Internal Organs or Animal Viscera used as food are the 
heart, tongue, brain, kidneys, liver, pancreas, thymus glands 
and paunch. Although some are as easily digested as most 
muscle tissue, they are not as nutritious, and most of them 
produce large quantities of uric acid. 

The heart, liver and kidneys, when properly cooked, are 
not as easily digested as other meats, on account of their close 
and firm texture, and should be eaten only by those of good 
digestive powers. 

The tongue is not very easily digested, for although the 
lean meat is tender, the fat is hard, and tends to retard diges- 
tion in the stomach. 

The brain is the most rapidly digested of meats, but a 
very high per cent, is of no use to the body. It is not suited 
for invalid diet on account of the high fat content. 

The paunch is the third stomach of the ox and called tripe. 
When properly cooked it is easily digested, but contains too 
much fat to give an invalid. 

The pancreas and thymus glands of the calf or lamb are 
sold under the name of sweetbreads. They are most easily 
digested, but give rise to uric acid. Note chapter on Sweet- 
breads. 

Beef. Beef, is without doubt, the most valuable kind of 
meat; it is nutritious, of excellent flavor, and comparatively 
easy of digestion. 

Test for Good Beef. The flesh is firm and fine grained in 
texture; bright red in color when first cut and upon exposure 
to air ; looks Juicy and well-mottled and coated with fat, and 
the fat is of yellowish color and firm. 

The best beef is obtained from the steer of four to six years 
of age. After killing, the animal should hang for two to 
three weeks. 

Veal. The flesh of the calf is difficult of digestion and 
should only be used in the sick room for making broth. It 
should never be eaten by those of weak digestion. It con- 



MEAT 145 

tains less albuminous substances, and more gelatin than 
beef. 

Test for Good Veal. It should be of a pinkish oolor, with 
clear, firm, white fat, fine grained and tender. The cut most 
used for broth and soup is the lower part of the leg known 
as the knuckle. 

Mutton. Xext to beef, mutton is considered the most 
nutritious of meats, and by some considered as easily digested ; 
but it is known that fat of mutton, which consists largely of 
stearin, is not as easily digested. 

The best quality of mutton comes from a sheep from three 
iro five years old; after killing it should be allowed to hang 
to ripen and to develop the flavor. 

Test for Good Mutton. The flesh is fine grained, bright 
pink in color, the fat is white, hard and flaky, and the skin 
«'omes off easily. The bones of mutton are white and smooth 
and round at the Joints. 

Iamb. Lamb of the rigLt age is as nutritious as beef or 
mutton but the flesh is milder in flavor. 

Lamb is sold as " spring lamb " when killed at six weeks to 
three months old. It is very expensive and comes into the 
market early in the year — February and March. Lamb is 
usually killed when a year old, and should be sold imme- 
diately after killing; in this respect it differs from beef and 
mutton, which should hang after killing to ripen and develop 
the flavor. 

Test for Lamb. Lamb can be distinguished from mutton 
by the pinkish color of the bone, and the serrated joints. 

Pork. The flesh of the pig is the most indigestible of 
all meats on account of the large percentage of fat which it 
contains, consequently it is not used in cookery for the sick, 
except sometimes a small amount of ham, salt pork or bacon, 
as the salty taste occasionally acts as a stimulant to the lost 
appetite of the convalescent. Ham and bacon are more easily 
digested than other cuts of pork, and when thin strips of 
bacon are cooked crisp they are easily digested. Bacon is 
from the flank of pork and is salted and smoked. Xext to

butter and cream, bacon fat is the most easily assimilated of 
ordinary food fats. 

Cuts of Meat. ^ The methods of cutting sides of beef, veal, 
mutton, and pork into parts, and the terms used for the differ- 
ent "cuts," as these parts are commonly called, vary in 
different localities. The diagrams show the positions of the 
different cuts, both in the live animal and in the dressed car- 
cass, as found in the markets. The lines of division between 
the different cuts will vary slightly, according to the usage of 
the local market, even where the general method of cutting 
is as here indicated. The names of the same cuts likewise 
vary in different parts of the country.

MEAT 1^7 

The general method or cutting up a side of beef is illus- 
trated in Fig. 5, which shows the relative position of the cuts 
in the animal and in a dressed side. The neck piece is fre- 
quently cut so as to include more of the chuck than is repre- 
sented' by the diagrams. The shoulder-clod is usually cut 
without bone, while the shoulder (not included in diagram) 
would include more or less of the shoulder blade and of the 
upper end of the fore-shank. Shoulder steak is cut from the 
chuck. In many localities the plate is made to include all 
the parts of the fore-quarter designated on the diagrams as 
brisket, cross-ribs, plate, and navel, and different portions of 
the plate, as thus cut, are spoken of as the " brisket end of 
plate " and " navel end of plate." This part of the animal is 
largely used for corning. The ribs are frequently divided 
into first, second, and third cuts, the latter lying nearest the 
chuck and being slightly less desirable than the former. The 
chuck is sometimes sub-divided in a similar manner, the third 
cut of the chuck being nearest the neck. The names applied 
to different portions of the loin vary considerably in different 
localities. The part nearest the ribs is frequently called 
*' small end of loin " or " short steak." The other end of the 
loin is called " hip sirloin " or " sirloin." Between the short 
steak and the sirloin is a portion quite generally called the 
"tenderloin," for the reason that the real tenderloin, the 
very tender strip of meat lying inside the loin, is found most 
fully developed in this cut. Porterhouse steak is a term most 
frequently applied either to the short steak or the tenderloin. 
It is not uncommon to find the flank cut so as to include more 
!)f the loin than is indicated in the figures, in which case the 
upper portion is called " flank steak." The larger part of the 
flank is, however, very frequently corned, as is also the case 
with the rump. In some markets the rump is cut so as to 
include a portion of the loin, which is then sold as " rump 
steak." The portion of the round on the inside of the leg 
is regarded as more tender than that on the outside, and is 
frequently preferred to the latter. As the leg lies upon the 
butcher's table, this inside of the round is usually on the 



148 



ANIMAL FOODS 



upper or top side, and is therefore called " top round." Oeca^ 
sionally the plate is called the " rattle."

shoulder; 4, flank; 5, loin; 6, leg. — (Atwater and Bryant, Bulletin No. 28, 
Office of Experiment Stations, United States Department of Agriculture.) 

Fig. 7 shows the relative position of the cuts in a dressed 
side of mutton or lamb and in a live animal. The cuts in a 
side of lamb and mutton number but six, three in each quar- 
ter. The chuck includes the ribs as far as the end of the 
shoulder blades, beyond which comes the loin. The flank is 
made to include all the under side of the animal. Some 
butchers, however, make a large number of cuts in the fore- 
quarter, including a portion of the cuts marked " loin " and 
" chuck " in Fig. 7, to make a cut designated as " rib," and 
a portion of the " flank " and " shoulder " to make a cut 
designated as "brisket." The term "chops" is ordinarily 
used to designate portions of either the loin, ribs, chuck or 
shoulder, which are either cut or " ch'^pped " by the butcher 
into pieces suitable for frying or boiliLg. The chuck and ribs 
are sometimes called the " rack."

ENERGY VALUE OF MEAT 

See Table, under names of meat, as Beef — Mutton — 
Lamb — Bacon — Ham, etc. 

See Table, page 53, for energy value of other ingredients. 

TO BROIL STEAK 

Wipe, trim off the superfluous fat and remove a little of 
the bone. Save the flank ends for broiled meat cakes. Heat 
and grease the broiler with some of the fat. Place meat in 
broiler with fat edge next to handle and broil over a clear 
Are, turning every ten seconds for the first minute, holding 
broiler near the coals that the surface may be well seared, 
\hus preventing escape of juices; then cook at lower tempera- 
ture, holding the broiler higher. 

Steak cut one inch thick will take five minutes if liked 
1 are, and eight minutes if well done ; one and one-half inch 
Ihick, eight to ten minutes. Serve on a hot platter and sea- 
bon with butter, salt and pepper, or with Maitre d'Hotel But- 
ler. 

Xote. — Steak should be cut at least one inch thick ; many 
prefer it much thicker. The most tender steaks are tender- 
loin, sirloin and cross-cut of rump. Sirloin, porterhouse (a 
thick slice of sirloin with tenderloin attached), cross-cut of 
the rump and top of the round are all good steaks. The top 
of round is solid meat and a cheap steak; is tender if cut 
from animal of right age and is the second or third cut from 
top of round. 

MAITRE D'HOTEL BUTTER, 443 CALORIES

shape into small, flat, circular cakes. Into saute pan put a 
little beef fat, when smoking hot, put in the cakes and cook 
a few moments on each side and turn ; it will take about live 
minutes to cook them. Season well with salt, pepper and 
butter, and serve on hot platter. Do not add salt before cook- 
ing, as it toughens the meat. 

SCRAPED BEEF 

See " Beef Preparations " for recipe. Page 217. 

MUTTON CHOPS BROILED i 

Cut away the tough outside skin, trim off a part of the 
fat. Broil same as steak — that is, close to the glowing coals 
— for about one minute, turning every ten seconds, then cook 
at a lower temperature, holding the broiler higher. Will take 
four or six minutes for a chop one inch thick. Mutton, like 
beef, should be served rare. Season chops with salt and 
pepper, but not with butter, as the meat is rich and fat and 
•does not require it. 

LAMB CHOPS BROILED 1 

Prepare and broil same as for mutton chops, except that 
they are to be well done instead of rare, to accomplish this 
about three minutes longer cooking will be required; for a 
•chop one inch thick, from eight to ten minutes. 

FRENCH CHOPS 1 

Trim a chop until there is nothing left but the round 
muscle at the thick end, with a little fat about it. Cut away 
all the meat from the bone, which will then look like a handle 
with a meat morsel at one end. Broil, and serve on hot 
platter with paper handles on chops, and garnished with pars- 
ley and peas. 

PAN-BROILED CHOPS i 

Chops are fairly good pan-broiled. The same principle is 
to be followed as in the cooking over coals — that is, a high 
degree of heat at first, to sear the outside before the juice 

^ Chope average 300 Cal. per 100 gms.

MEAT 151 

escapes, and a lower temperature afterward — therefore, heat 
the saute pan or spider exceedingly hot (use no fat), drop in 
the chop, count ten and turn, repeating for about one minute, 
then draw the pan to the back or side of the stove and finish 
cooking slowly. A chop one inch thick will be perfectly done 
in from five to seven minutes. If the pan is hot enough at 
first there will be no loss of juice or flavor. Season and serve 
in the same manner as broiled chops. 

CHOPS (OR BIRDS) BROILED IN PAPER i 

Prepare a chop as for pan-broiling. Spread a piece of 
paper evenly and thickly with butter. Lay on it a nicely 
trimmed chop and double the paper with edges together. 
Fold and crease the edges on the three sides, then fold and 
crease again, so that the butter cannot run out. These folds 
should be half-an-inch wide. It will be necessary to have 
the sheet of paper — foolscap or heavy white paper — consid- 
erably more than twice as large as the chop. Broil over coals, 
not too near, turning often so that the temperature will not 
get so high as to ignite the paper. A chop broiled in this way 
is basted in the butter and in its own juices, and is very deli- 
cate. A chop three-quarters of an inch thick will cook in five 
minutes ; one an inch thick, in eight. 

Should the paper ignite, it need not destroy the chop. 
Take it out and put into a fresh paper and try again. The 
chop should be served hot, seasoned with salt and pepper. 

Xote. — Birds may be broiled in the same way 

BROILED BACON 

Cut bacon in as thin slices as possible, and remove rind. 
Put in broiler, placing broiler over baking pan, and cook in 
hot oven until crisp. 

CTTRLED BACON 

Heat saute pan very hot. Put in strips of very thin sliced 
bacon. As fat is drawn out, pour it of! into cup ; cook bacon 
until crisp and brown. Drain on brown paper.

BROILED HAH 

Cut slices of ham one-third inch thick. If very salt soak 
fifteen minutes in lukewarm water ; broil three minutes or un- 
til brown on both sides, turning frequently. A slice of boiled 
ham is very delicate cooked in this same way, cooking it less 
time. 

ROAST MEATS 

Prepare meat, put on rack in dripping pan, dredge with 
salt and flour and cook in hot oven until the surface is seared, 
reduce the heat and cook slowly the required time. 

Beef, rare 13 minutes per pound. 

Beef, rare (over 5 lbs.) 18 minutes per pound. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST MEATS 
1 tablespoon fat. 1 cup boiling water. 

1 tablespoon flour. 

Pour fat from baking pan and return to pan the quantity 
desired. Add flour and when well browned pour on gradually 
the boiling water, stirring constantly. Cook five minutes, 
season with salt and pepper, and strain. 

POULTRY AND GAME^ 

Poultry and game are generally classed together, poultry 
being applied to domesticated birds raised for their flesh or 
eggs or both. Wild birds are all classed as game. 

Digestibility. Chicken may be introduced early into the 
dietary of the convalescent, for it is one of the most easily 
digested of meats. Chicken is more easily digested than 
fowl, but is not as nutritious. The white meat of the breast 
is particularly free from fat, has short fibers and small amount 
of connective tissues, and is easier to digest than the dark 
meat. 

Squab, quail, pigeons and the white meat of turkey are al&o 
easily digested. 

Duck and goose contain a large quantity of fat and are nat 
as easily digested. 

1 For further information, note "Poultry as Food." Farmer's Bulletiu, 
No. 182, Dept. of Agriculture, V'^shington- D. C. 



POULTRY AND GAME 153 

Game is comparatively easy of digestion but too highly 
flavored for most invalids. The cuts from the breast are 
the best for an invalid. 

Test for Selecting a Chicken. The cartilage at the end of 
the breast bone must be soft and pliable, the skin smooth 
and the feet soft. Chickens are used for broiling and roast- 
ing. 

Test for Selecting a Fowl. The cartilage at the end of the 
breast bone is firm, the feet are hard and dry. An old fowl, 
not too fat, is best for broths. One from one to two years is 
best for roasting, or where the meat substance is desired. The 
proportion of bone to meat in chicken under this age makes 
them expensive eating. 

Principles of Cooking. In general same as for cooking of 
other meats. 

When the layer of meat over the bones is very thin, as in 
young chickens or squabs, broiling is preferable to roasting. 

An old fowl can sometimes be made tender without having 
all its flavor stewed into the broth, by cooking in a small 
amount of water in a double boiler for a long time, or in a 
fireless cooker. 

A general rule for roasting chickens or turkeys is twenty 
minutes to the pound. Ducks and geese, having tougher 
fibers, require a longer time for thorough cooking. 

GENERAL RULE FOR CLEANING POTTLTRY 

Cut off head and feet and pull out pin feathers. If the 
bird has not been drawn, make an incision below the breast 
just large enough to admit the hand (or finger for the small 
birds). With the hand or finger, draw all the entrails out at 
one time. Care must be taken not to break them, especially 
the gall-bladder. Turn down the skin of the neck, cut off 
neck close to body and pull out wind pipe and crop. Cut 
out the oil bag. Cut through skin of the leg a little below the 
joint (not cutting the tendons), press against table and break 
and pull off foot with tendons, which will come out in break- 



154 ANIMAL FOODS 

ing if chicken is young. In fowls you may have to pull them 
out separately with skewer. Singe the bird by holding it 
over a tablespoon of burning alcohol, or paper (holding over 
sink). Wash by allowing the cold water to run through and 
over it, and dry well inside and out and prepare further for 
broiling or roasting, etc. 

DRY DRESSING FOR STUFFING, 1100 CALORIES 

11/2 cup stale bread crumbs. Powdered sage, marjoram, and 

1/3 cup butter (not melted). summer savory. 

Salt, pepper. 

Thoroughly mix ingredients and season to taste. Fill in 
both openings of bird and sew the skin at both ends, and turn 
the skin of neck over, and fasten to back. Oysters can be 
added to dressing if desired, omitting all seasonings but the 
salt and pepper. 

TO TRUSS POULTRY 
After stuffing and sewing up the openings, draws the thighs 
olose to body and secure in place by putting a skewer through 
them and the body. Fold wings under back by taking end 
of wing and place in under back which fastens it. Cross the 
drum-sticks and tie with long string and fasten to the tail, 
and tie string so that it will hold thighs close to the body. 
Cut and remove string before serving the bird.

the flour should be well browned, then reduce heat of oven and 
cook more slowly. Baste every ten minutes with one-fourth

cooking that it may brown evenly. When cooked, remove lo 
hot platter and make the gravy. 

A chicken four to five pounds will require about one and 
one-half to two hours for cooking. Turkey, nine pounds, two- 
and one-half to three hours. Ducks (domestic), one to one 
and one-half hours. Duck (wild), twenty-five to thirty min- 
utes. Goose, nine pounds, two to two hours and one-half. 

GRAVY FOR ROAST POULTRY 

Clean the heart, liver and gizzard by removing the mem- 
brane, blood vessels and clotted blood from the heart. Cut 
liver from the gall bladder and remove all green on liver. 
Clean gizzard and cut through edge carefully to sac, and re- 
move carefully not to break it, wash giblets (that is, the 
heart, liver, gizzard) and the neck and put on to cook in two 
and one-half cups of cold water, cook slowly at the simmering 
point until tender. 

After chicken has been removed from pan, pour off all the 
fat, strain and return to pan four tablespoons of fat and add 
four tablespoons of flour, brown together thoroughly, and add 
gradually the water the giblets were cooked in. Cook five 
minutes, stirring constantly, add hot water if gravy is too 
thick, and salt and pepper to taste, and the finely-chopped 
giblets. 

TO BONE BIRDS 

Select bird that is fresh-killed, dry-picked, and not drawn. 
Cut off head and feet, singe and remove pin feathers, crop, and 
oil bag. Cut off wings close to body. Lay on board breast 
down and cut to bone the entire length of spine. Scrape the 
flesh from backbone the entire length of body, working toward 
the breast, cutting the tendinous portions as reached. Whea 
edge of breastbone is reached, care must be taken not to break 
through skin. Scrape flesh from second joint and drum- 
sticks, laying flesh back and pulling out bone (as if turning 
glove off inside out). 

Scrape flesh from lower part of back and withdraw from

In the white-fleshed fish the fat is found principally in 
the liver. This is the only class usually considered in the 
cookerv for the sick. 

In the dark-fleshed fish the fat is found distributed through- 
out the body. A considerable amount of the protein of fish 
is in the form of gelatin. Fish is less rich in extractives, and 
hence less stimulating than meat. 

Digestibility. The digestibility of scaly fish depends upon 
the quantity of fat present and the coarseness of the fiber. 



160 ANIMAL FOODS 

The white-fleshed fish are less nutritious and stimulating than 
the dark-fleshed fish as they contain less fat and extractives 
and more water. They are consequently more easily digested. 
With the exception of cod, white fish is useful for a con- 
valescent diet, for those of sedentary habits, for children, 
and others for whom the extractives of meat are less desir- 
able. 

Oily fish should not be eaten by those of weak digestion 
or given to the sick. In some cases they may be served dur- 
ing advanced convalescence. 

Salt fish is not as easily digested as fresh fish, as the fibers 
are apt to be hardened in the process of salting. Salt codfish 
is an exception, for if finely divided and served in an ap- 
petizing manner it is a valuable and inexpensive form of 
protein food. As a rule, dried, smoked or pickled fish should 
not be given to the sick. 

By some persons, fish cannot be eaten without causing in- 
digestion or biliousness. The fat sometimes disagrees, caus- 
ing acidity and eructations of the stomach. 

Composition. In composition fish is similar to meat, con- 
taining proteins, extractives, fats, salts and water. As a rule, 
fish contains more water and less fat than meat, therefore it 
is more easily digested ; and it is due to this, its easy digesti- 
bility, that white fish by some is considered a brain food, and 
not, as is popularly supposed, to the amount of phosphonis it 
contains; in fact, fish does not contain as much phosphorus 
as some meat. Fish contains less extractives than meat and 
it is due to this that people tire more quickly of it tlian of 
meat. 

Lemon juice and vinegar are desirable condiments to serve 
with fish. The acid is a desirable neutralizing agency, as 
the juice of fish, especially shellfish, is of an alkaline 
nature. 

Nutritive Value. The chief nutritive constituents of fish, 
as of meat, are their proteins and fats. Their energy value 
depends largely on the amount of fat they contain. 



FISH 161 

When Fish are in Season. Halibut, haddock, flounder and 
cod are in season all the year. 

Turbot, October to May; shad, February to May; salmon. 
May to September; blue fish and mackerel, May to October; 
sturgeon, April to September; trout (lake), April to August. 

Test for Freshness. In fresh fish the gills are red, the eyes 
bright and protruding, the flesh is firm and there is no un- 
pleasant odor. The first two tests disappear after the fish 
has been out of water a short time, and although the flavor of 
tlie fish is not as good, it is not spoiled. But if the last two 
tests are not present the fish should not be used. Great care 
should be taken that fish is perfectly fresh, in season, and 
thoroughly cooked, or it will be indigestible and sometimes 
poisonous. Unless these conditions are known to exist, fish 
should not be served to the sick. 

" In many European cities fish are sold alive, the customer 
selecting his fish as it swims in a tank. It would seem that 
this excellent method might be used in our cities, especially 
those situated on the seaboard, at least for customers who are 
fastidious and who are willing to pay an extra price for 
a special article when it is warranted." (Farmer's Bulletin 
No. 375.) 

Principles to be Observed in Cooking Fish. As in meat, 
albumin is the principal constituent to be considered in the 
cooking of fish. Hence the same principles which apply to 
the cooking of meat apply also to the cooking of fish. 

See page 17, for effect of heat on albumin.

BROILED FISH 



White fish, trout, small blue fish, mackerel, shad and small 
cod should be split down the back, and broiled whole, and if 
preferred, cut off the head and tail. Halibut and salmon 
should be cut into inch slices and turned often while broil- 
ing. 

Clean Fish. Wipe with a cloth wet in salt-water, and dry 
on a fish towel. Season ; oily fish need only salt and pepper, 
but dry white fish should be spread with butter and salt and 
pepper before broiling. Use a double wire broiler greased 
well with salt pork rind. Put thickest edge of fish next 
middle of broiler, turn often while broiling; with split fish 
sear the flesh side first and then turn. 

The time of cooking will vary with the thickness of fish. 
Fish is done when flesh separates easily from the bone. 

The fire should be hot and clear. When ready to serve, 
loosen the fish from broiler on each side. Open broiler, slide 
fish onto platter, having flesh side uppermost. Spread with 
butter, salt and pepper. Garnish with parsley and slices of 
lemon. Or serve with Butter Cream and a border of potato 
balls. 

Note " Fish Sauces " for Butter Cream. 

BAKED FISH 

Clean flsh. Wipe with cloth wet in salted water, dry on a 
fish towel and bake on a greased fish sheet, placed in a drip- 
ping pan. A strip of cotton cloth, by which it may be lifted 
from the pan, may be substituted for the fish sheet. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, brush over with melted butter, dredge 
with flour, and place around fish small pieces of fat salt pork. 
Bake in hot oven until fish separates from bone when lifted 
with fork. Baste every ten minutes. Serve plain with 
melted butter, or with Egg Sauce.

SHELL-FISH 

OYSTERS AND CLAMS 

Only the mollusks are considered in this book, because the 
crustaceans are not easily digested, and therefore are not suit- 
able for an invalid diet. 

Crustaceans. Tlie most popular of the crustacean^ are the 



SU ELL-FISH HVr 

crab and lobster. Tbev are bigbly nutritious, but at the saane 
time liighly indigestible. 

Oysters. Oysters are valuable food for invalids and con- 
valescents. Their nutritive value is not high, but they are 
easilv digested and possess a delicate flavor which is ac- 
ceptable to most palates. 

Composition. The composition of oysters, reckoned as 
" solids." i. e., removed from the shell, is as follows: 88.3% 
water, 6.1% protein, 1.4% fat, and 3.3% carbohydrate. 

The carbohydrate is in the form of glycogen, being found 
in the liver, which constitutes a large proportion of the oyster. 

Digestibiliiy. The soft part of the oyster or clam is made* 
up largely of the stomach and liver and is easily digested 
when cooked in a variety of ways — broiling, roasting, stew- 
ing, panning and steaming — but not fried when served to 
the sick. 

The hard part of shellfish is the muscle which fastens the 
animal to the shell, and is rendered tougher by all forms of 
cooking; therefore, when whole oysters are to be eaten, they 
are more easily digested when served raw or broiled slightly 
in the shell. They can be digested by fever patients and 
those suffering from many forms of gastric disorders. 

It is desirable in acute illness to serve only the soft part 
of the oyster, but in the later stages of convalescence the 
■whole oyster can be served raw or in stew and soups, which 
are recommended on account of their liquid form and warmth. 

^Vhen in Season. Oysters are in season from September to 
May. During the rest of the year they are insipid and unfit 
for food. 

Principles to he Carefully Observed in Serving and Cook- 
ing Oysters for the Sicl\ (a) Make every effort to have the 
ovster alive when used, or as fresh as can be obtained from 
a reliable dealer. Many serious cases of illness and even 
death have been caused by eating oysters so long dead that 
poisonous substances had formed in them. Great care should 
also be taken that oysters are not procured from beds where 



1C8 ANIMAL FOODS 

the water has been contaminated in any way. " As it is in 
general impossible to learn their origin the rule of never eat- 
ing them in the raw state is adopted by many. The practice 
of fattening or 'floating' oysters in fresh or in brackish 
water robs them of much of their fine flavor, and since the 
most accessible supply of such water is at the outlet of 
streams, and as such streams are frequently polluted by sew- 
age, many persons believe that this practice should be for- 
bidden by law." ^ 

(b) Oysters contain an albuminous substance which in- 
.creases in hardness with an increase of temperature, just as 
the albumin of an egg does. When oysters are cooked with 
reference to this albuminous substance, they are also cooked 
in the best possible manner with reference to their other con- 
stituents; therefore subject them to a low temperature, for 
a short time, bearing in mind that 160 to 180 degrees Fahren- 
lieit is the cooking temperature of albumin. 

General rule is to remove the oyster from heat as soon 
as the body grows plump and the edges curl, if cooked be- 
yond this stage they are over-cooked. 

Varieties. In Xew York State the "Blue Points" are 
considered the finest for serving raw. They came originally 
from Blue Point, Long Island. 

In Massachusetts the " Cove " Oyster is considered the fin- 
est for serving raw. They come from a still water cove near 
Plymouth. 

Clams. Clams are similar in composition to the oyster 
and same general rules followed in preparing and serving. 
They are much used for food and considered a great delicacv. 
They contain a tough portion that is not used in sick-room 
cookerv, but the clear juice, on account of its digestibilitv 
and stimulating properties, is invaluable in the sick room. 
Clams are in season all the year around. 

Varieties. There are two varieties, the hard and soft shell 
clams. The hard shell are known as quahaugs. The small

RAW OYSTERS 

Wash, scrub the shells well under a stream of water with 
a vegetable brush. With a hammer break the thin edges of 
the Siell so that a knife may be inserted to sever the muscle 
which holds the two parts of the shell together ; when this is 
cut remove the upper half and wipe the edges free from any 
grains of sand. Then sever the muscle which Joins the oyster 
to the other shell, so that it may be easily lifted out without 
the necessity of cutting. Arrange six oysters on an oyster- 
plate on crushed ice, and serve with salt, black pepper and 
lemon juice. A quarter of lemon cut lengthwise may be 
placed in the center of plate, and bit of parsley. 
OYSTERS ROASTED IN THE SHELL 

Wash the shells very carefully with a brush. Put them 
in a wire broiler over glowing coals, the round side of shell 
down so as to hold the juice. Cook them quickly, turning 
once or twice until the shell opens. They may also be cooked 
in a hot oven. When done remove the upper half of the shell ; 
season them quickly with salt, pepper and a tiny bit of but- 
ter and vinegar, if liked, and serve them while very hot. 

The true oyster flavor is delightfully developed by pre- 
paring in this way. They may also be served with melted 
butter, salt, pepper and lemon juice. 

TO WASH OYSTERS 

Place oysters in strainer over a bowl and pour one table- 
spoon of water over each one-half cup of oysters. Take each 
oyster up in fingers and remove any particle of shell that may 
adhere to tough muscle.

Composition. Eggs contain protein, fat, mineral matter 
and water. The composition of the hen's egg is as follows :

From this table it may be seen that the white of egg con- 
sists of eight-tenths water, the remaining portion being^prin- 
cipally protein (albumin), with a littk mineral mattel-. etc., 
the yolk is about half water, one-third fat, and nearly one- 
sixth protein, with almost twice as much mineral matter as 
the white. 

Varieties. By eggs the product of the domestic fowl is 
commonly meant. The eggs of the duck, goose, turkev, etc., 
are edible, but are hardly suited for the sick, because o'f'ihoir 
stronger flavor. The color of the shell is due to a pigment and 
has no connection with the composition of the egg. Other 
things being equal, the edible portions of brown-shelled and 
white-shelled eggs have the same food value. 

Digestibility. Eggs are easily digested and very thoroughly 
absorbed in the intestines. If the absorption is ^delayed, de- 
composition follows with production of sulphuretted hydrogen 
and ammonia, which causes considerable gastro-enteric dis- 
turbance. The yolk is usually the cause of this disturbance. 
The digestibility of an egg depends upon its freshness and the 
manner in which it is cooked. ' Carelessness in cooking and 
serving may make an egg difficult of digestion and unap- 
petizing, when, if it is cooked properly, it would be more 
palatable and easy of digestion. For a discussion of the di- 
gestibility of raw eggs see '' Albuminous Beverages," page 118. 
Eaw eggs are added to various foods, as milk and broth, etc., 
to give extra nutriment. Eggs are freely prescribed for 
those suffering from loss of flesh and strength, as the con- 
valescent, anaemic, or in tuberculosis. 
A soft-cooked egg digests very quickly. A hard-cooked

EGGS 177 

egg as commonly cooked is difficult to digest, but cooked at 
proper temperature and chopped tlery fine will digest about as 
quickly as a soft-cooked Qgg, 

Nviritive Value. Eggs arc a very nutritious food, com- 
parable with meat, milk, cheese, and other animal foods. 
Eggs are not a cheap food but their nutritive value is such 
tlial they furnish a good return for the money expended. 
:\[any persons will be satisfied with an egg who would not be 
with the equivalent food value in the form of meat, and eggs 
are valuable for giving variety to the diet and for furnishing 
an easily digested protein food, especially for the sedentary. 
For children they are much better than meat, because the 
fat is in an emulsified, and hence easily digested form, and 
because of their ash constituents, and because they do not con- 
tain the stimulating extractives which are present in meat. 
The yolk is rich in compounds of iron, phosphorus, calcium, 
magnesium. The protein of egg yolk is combined with leci- 
thin, a phosphorized fat which has come to be regarded as 
an important constituent of food, especially for the growing 
animal. Egg yolk is a valuable source of both the fat-soluble 
and tlie water-soluble vitamines. Egg yolks are frequently 
prescribed for invalids requiring an easily assimilated, concen- 
trated food. It should be remembered that when fat is barred 
from the diet, egg yolk should not be given. 

Egg white is valuable chiefly as a source of protein. Be- 
cause of its mild flavor it can be combined with many sub- 
stances, especially milk and other beverages (See "Al- 
buminous Beverages," page 118). 

With some persons, eggi^ induce cjonstipation, or have a 
slight aphrodisiac effect. They contain sulphur, and unless 
digested before decomposition occurs in the alimentary tract, 
give rise to hydrogen sulphide gas. They should not be eaten 
by those suffering from flatulent dyspepsia, gastric dilatation, 
or anv severe gastric derangement. They are contraindicated 
in acute Bright's disease. 



178 ANIMAL FOODS 

Principles to be Observed in Cooking. The principal con- 
stituent of the egg white is albumin, which should be cooked 
in such a manner as to require the least possible exjienditure 
of force in digestion. Those who are ill cannot afford to 
waste energy, and whether they are forced to do so or not de- 
pends much upon those who prepare their food. 

Effect of Temperature on Albumin. See " Albumin," page 
17. 

The proper cooking temperature of egg albumin is 160 to 
ISO degrees Fahrenheit, when it is found to be tender, soft, 
jejly-like, and in an easily digested state. 

But cooked at the boiling point of water, 212 degrees 
Fahrenheit, albumin is found to be firm, compact, tough and 
indigestible. With this knowledge we can appreciate the 
necessity of cooking eggs at a temperature below that of boil- 
ing water. It is often advisable to cook the white and yolk 
of eggs separately, as the yolk when hard cooked (at proper 
temperature) and mealy is more easily digested than the 
soft cooked yolk, and the white more easily digested soft 
cooked. 

Suggestions. Eggs should be kept in a cool, dry place. 
Always wash eggs just before using. Save the shell for mak- 
ing boiled coffee, as the shells of three eggs is as effective in 
settling coffee as one wliole egg. ^^^len using several eggs 
break them separately in a saucer to test the quality of each. 

In beating fresh eggs to a stiff froth the albumin entraps 
the air, forming bubbles which ex])and and stiffen when ex- 
posed to heat and blended with batter and dougli, thus mak- 
ing the food light and spong}\ Sttde eggs lose this quality 
of frothincTss. 

Test fch- Fresh Eggs. To test the freshness of an egg hold 
it in front of an electric light or a candle in a dark room. If 
the egg is perfectly translucent throughout it is fresh. 

The principle upon which the methods of preserving eggs 
are based, is the covering of the surface of the egg with a 



EGGS 179 

preparation whicli prevents air from entering the Qgg and 
carrying with it the bacteria which cause decomposition.

MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS ^ 

Milk is the only substance in nature designed expressly for 
the nourishment of the young animal. It contains all the 
compounds necessary to support life, in remarkably good pro- 
portions and in very assimilable forms. It is a perfect food 
for infants, and is specially suited to the needs of certain 
classes of invalids. For the normal healthy adult it is un- 
desirable as the sole article of diet, because the proportion of 
water is so high that too large quantities have to be taken 
to supply tlie necessary energy; because the proportion of 
protein is unnecessarily high; and because it furnishes no 
indigestible residues to supply bulk for the perfect function- 
ing of the intestines. 

Composition. Milk contains all the essentials of an ade- 
quate diet. The proportions of the different nutrients vary 
somewhat with different species, and also with individuals of 
the same species. Cow's milk, wliich is most extensively used, 
is the only kind which will be considered here. Milk has a 
specific gravity of 1.027 to 1.035.

Bulletin No. 363, U. S. Dei)t. of Agriculture. Washington, D. C -farmer g 



MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 185 

The chief bulk is water, which averages 87 per cent. The 
solid matter is made up of proteins, fats, carbohydrates and 
mineral matter. The average percentages are as follows: 
Protein, 3.3 per cent. ; fat, i per cent. ; carbohydrates, 5 per 
cent. ; mineral matter, 0.7 per cent. 

The principal protein is casein, a compound containing 
both phosphorus and sulphur. Casein is precipitated (or 
coagulated) by the addition of acid or in neutral solutions, 
by rennet. Milk also contains lactalbumin, averaging about 
1/7 of the total protein. The character of the curd depends 
largely on the relative proportions of casein and lactalbumin. 

The fat of milk varies widely in amount. It is found 
throughout the milk in globules, i. e., as an emulsion. On 
standing, the fat rises to the top and forms cream chemically. 
Several fats are present, chiefly stearin, palmitin and olein, 
with smaller amounts of others, such as butj^in which give 
the characteristic flavor to butter. The chief carbohydrate is 
lactose or milk sugar. This remains in the whey when tlie 
casein and fat are removed. 

The ash constituents are mainly phosphates and chlorides 
of calcium, sodium and potassium. 

Digestihility. While milk is taken as a liquid, it should 
really be regarded as a solid food, for in the stomach it is 
coagulated by the action of the enzyme rennin in the gastric 
juice. If the milk is swallowed hastily, a large, tenacious 
curd may form, which will remain long in the stomach, and 
the milk will be regarded as difficult of digestion. If the 
milk is sipped slowly — or eaten with a spoon — the curds will 
be small, and hence readily acted on by the gastric juice. 
For this reason, the combination of milk with another food 
material, as bread or cereal gruel, may render it more easily 
digestible. Many persons think that ihey cannot digest milk. 
This is seldom true, if the above precautions are taken. 

Nutritive Value.-^ Milk is a rich source of protein. More- 
over, its proteins are of high biological value because they 
contain all the amino acids essential to good nutrition. Milk 
is the most valuable source of protein from infancy through- 



186 ANIMAL FOODS 

out the entire period of growth. It is non-stimulating and 
less liable to putrefaction in the alimentary tract than meat 
proteins. Given a quart of milk and an egg each day, a 
child under eight years of age on a suitable diet of proper 
fuel value, will have sufficient protein for all body needs. 

The fat of milk, being in an emulsified form, is more 
readily digested than the fat of meats and other similar foods. 
The carbohydrates of milk require onlv transformation to 
simple sugars by the intestinal enzvme lactase, to be per- 
fectly utilized. Often the energy value of milk is increased 
for infants and invalids, by addition of this soluble, mild- 
navored compound. 

The ash of milk contains the elements necessary to the 
body in particularly assimilable forms. It contains only a 
small amount of iron, but the iron present is in an especially 
valuable form. When milk is the chief source of nutriment, 
as with infants and young children, iron must be supplied by 
the addition of other foods such as egg yolk and spinach. 

The value of milk as a food is not appreciated by many 
people. It is frequently regarded as a beverage rather than 
a food, while in fact a quart of milk is equivalent in fuel value 
to approximately nine ounces of white bread, one pound 
of lean beef and nine eggs. It contains as much protein as 
about one third of a pound of lean beef, and in addition about 
as much fat as is supplied by one and one half ounces of but- 
ter, over one and one half ounces of milk sugar, and valuable 
mineral salts. Compared with other animal foods milk is a 
cheap food, even at present prices, and should enter freely into 
the dietary. It may be flavored with cocoa or coffee, or it 
need not be used as a beverage, but can be c(Jmbined with 
other materials in soups, sauces for vegetables, custards and 
the like, or used in cooking cereals, in place of water. 

The value of skim milk as a food also needs to be empha- 
sized. It has lost most of the fat in the skimming process, 
])ut has practically tlie same amount of protein, carbohy- 
drate and ash as whole milk. It is not as rich in flavor 
as whole milk, but used in combination with other foods 



MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 187 

it forms a very inexpensive source of valuable nutriment. 

Care of milk. The importance of keeping milk clean can- 
not be over-emphasized. Aside from all esthetic considera- 
tions, absolute cleanliness is essential as a protection to 
health. Milk is an excellent culture medium for bacteria, and 
these organisms may not only be of types producing changes 
in the character of the milk, such as alterations in flavor, 
odor, color, decomposition of proteins, formation of gases, 
alcohol, lactic acid, etc., but also disease germs, especially 
those of tuberculosis, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, diphtheria 
and septic sore throat. 

Commercially the care of milk has an important effect on the 
keeping qualities. For all these reasons, milk should come 
from a healthy animal in a sanitary environment. Milking 
must be done under conditions which protect the milk as 
fully as possible from contamination through impurities on 
the cow herself, on the hands or clothing of the milker, in 
the receptacles used for the milk, and in the air, in the place 
where the milking is done. Milk should be immediately 
cooled, and transported to the consumer in sealed bottles; 
cooling prevents the growth of bacteria. Such cautions 
necessarily increase the price of milk, but even then milk is 
a cheap food and the additional security is worth paying 

for. 

Certification of Milk. To insure a milk free from im- 
purities, the method of certification and pasteurization have 
been widely adopted. 

Certification involves a specific testing of milk against all 
accidental and harmful contamination. To secure it the 
services of chemists, bacteriologists and veterinary surgeons 
are required. The most vital object desired is the exclusion 
of tubercule bacilli from milk, which involves a special in- 
spection of dairy herds and rejection of tuberculous cows. 
Other pernicious germs, pus corpuscles, etc., are also sought 

for. 

Certification of milk requires periodical inspection of 



188 ANIMAL FOODS 

dairies, of bottled milk bought in open market, etc. All milk 
must correspond to a number and variety of tests, too numer- 
ous to be mentioned in this connection. Every branch of 
the milk trade is covered. Such milk receives a certificate 
which should contain the date of milking and is naturally ex- 
pensive, but it should be used whenever possible for infants 
and little children, and for all purposes in households which 
buy the best grades of other food materials. 

Pasteurization. This is the process by which milk is ren- 
dered more or less sterile through destruction of active bac- 
teria by heat. Various standards as to temperature and 
time have been adopted, but in general the milk is heated 
to a temperature not exceeding 145° F., for a period of 20 to 
.30 minutes, and then rapidly cooled to 45° F. or lower 
Most harmful bacteria and lactic acid bacteria are killed* 
Spores are not killed, and if the milk is not kept cold or is 
allowed to stand too long, putrefactive organisms develop. 
These putrefactive changes are very undesirable, so that the 
care of pasteurized milk is just as important as that of fresh 
milk. If carelessly handled, the fact that it does not sour 
readily is a menace to health rather than a benefit. 

Commercial pasteurization is a cheap and effective means 
of preventing the spread of ordinary infectious diseases. The 
degree of heat specified does not cliange materially the flavor 
or the chemical composition of the milk. It does destroy the 
antiscorbutic property. (See "Antiscorbutic Property of 
Foods," chapter 1, page 22.) When clean fresh milk cannot 
be absolutely insured, it is safer to pasteurize. But this proc- 
ess cannot make bad milk good or dirty milk clean. If 
bacteria have already produced poisonous products it will not 
destroy them. 

Sterilization. Sterilization is accomplished bv keeping milk 
at boiling temperature (212 degrees F.) for 10 or more min- 
utes, preferably in the vessel in which it is to remain. This 
will kill all living bacteria, but will not destroy spores. Hence 
to render milk absolutely sterile, repetition of the process on 
successive days is necessary. This is rarely done, as the spores 



MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 189 

are not likely to develop if the milk is kept at a temperature 
of 40 degrees F. or less. 

Sterilized milk is not an ideal food. Boiling changes the 
taste, and the cream does not rise as quickly; the chemical 
nature of the milk is altered. It is less easily coagulated by 
rennet, since the calcium salts are changed. The antiscorbu- 
tic property is destroyed. Sterilization should be regarded 
as an emergency measure, for hot weather, when cooling facili- 
ties are lacking. 

MILK PRODUCTS 

Butter. Butter consists almost entirely of separated milk 
fat. Churning causes the fat globules to unite into a solid 
mass. The cream is first allowed to ripen for some hours. 
This process gives the characteristic taste and odor, which is 
due to action of bacteria. "WTien kept, butter tends to turn 
rancid, owing to the fermehtation of a small quantity of casein 
present. Salt is added largely to prevent this change. But- 
ter is very palatable, and one of the most digestible forms 
of fat. 

Cheese. Cheese is made from full milk, skim milk or 
cream. It consists of the casein of the milk and more or 
less of the fat and mineral matters. The flavor is due to the 
action of enzymes in molds or bacteria. Cheese is a very 
concentrated nutritious food, and very thoroughly assimilated. 
It is not usually well borne by invalids and convalescents, 
however. 

Cream. Cream is the fatty layer which forms at the top 
of milk which is allowed to stand undisturbed. It contains 
the fat of the milk, water, some protein, carbohydrates and 
mineral matter. The percentage of fat is exceedingly vari- 
able, ranging from about 16 per cent, to 40 per cent. The 
cream which rises on milk after 24 hours is called gravity 
cream and contains about 16 per cent. fat. The richer creams 
are obtained by centrifugalizing the milk. Cream in large 



190 ANIMAL FOODS 

quantities is less easily digested than an equal amount of 
whole milk because of the large amount of fat, but this form 
of fat is easily digested compared with other food fats, and 
hence is often ordered by physicians. 

Curds. When milk sours, owing to the formation of 
lactic acid by the action of lactic acid bacteria upon the 
sugar, or when the enzyme rennet is added to fresh milk at 
body temperature, and the clot is stirred, the curds separate 
from the whey. 

Curds consist of coagulated casein, which commonly car- 
ries with it the fat and gentle heat facilitates this separation, 
but a high temperature renders tlio curd tough and indigesti- 
ble. With or without the addition of cream, curds are^'used 
as cottage cheese and is a very cheap, nutritious food. 

Junket. If sweet milk is allowed to stand undisturbed 
after the addition of rennet, the thickened, custard-like mass 
is called junket. This is a valuable method of using milk, 
especially for invalids, children, and those who from personal 
idiosyncrasy cannot drink milk. 

Whey. This substance may be either sweet when formed 
by junket or sour when otherwise produced. It contains 
most of the lactose, lactalbumin and ash constituents of the 
milk, but has so little nutritive value, owing to the removal of 
the milk fat and casein, that it may be regarded as a beverage. 
See page 185. 

Sour Milk. "When whole milk sours, with the formation 
of " curds and whey," the entire product is known as clabber 
or bonny-clabber. It is wholesome, and nutritious, since it 
contains all the ingredients naturally present in milk. By 
some it is used as a beverage. When not so relished, it can be 
used to good advantage in cooking, adding its nutritive value 
to any dish in which it is incorporated. 

Buttermilk. True buttermilk, which is common on farms, 
is seldom found in commerce. Unless produced where sold, 
its genuineness may be a matter of question. Those who are 
familiar with the genuine article state that the delicacy of 
its flavor, its consistency, etc., are much superior to the so- 



MILK AND MILK PRODUCTS 191 

called buttermilk of commerce. The composition of the two 
articles is practically the same. When skim milk, the cream 
having been removed by the separator, is allowed to sour, it 
is said to resemble ordinary buttermilk, and the fluid which 
goes by the latter name, sold extensively throughout Greater 
Xew York, is said to be sour skim milk. 

Meischnickojf Artificially Soured Milk. The announce- 
ment some years ago by Metschnickoff that the foregoing 
products were of very great hygienic and therapeutic value in 
disinfecting the intestines has resulted in the wholesale pro- 
duction of a substance which differs from ordinary sour 
milk in that it is prepared from a pure culture of lactic- 
acid germs. This product is doubtless destined to replace 
the older ones on account of its freedom from undesirable 
forms of bacteria. The technique for preparing it, devised 
priginallv bv Metschnickoff himself, also places it in a higher 
tlass than the older preparations. Pure cultures are sold in 
ihe natural liquid form or are desiccated and sold as tablets. 
Fermented Mill: Milk which has been fermented is really 
H derivative of native milk, and in parts of Europe and Asia 
constitutes an important article of diet. The fermentation 
is either the lactic alone or lactic and alcoholic together. 

The ferments used consist chiefly of various " leavens " 
or cultures wliich cause lactic acid fermentation. People who 
have subsisted on this milk for centuries simply use a por- 
tion of old fermented milk to leaven fresh milk. These 
leavens varv considerably in composition, and the milk used 
may be from one of several domestic animals. Some leavens 
contain yeast germs, so that alcohol may or may not be 
present. ' The native preparations which have been imitated 
in this country are kumyss, kefir and matzoon. 

Kumijss was prepared originally from mares' milk. The 
leaven contains lactic acid germs and yeast. The product 
therefore contains lactic acid, alcohol, and carbonic acid 
gas. representing an acid, effervescing, mildly alcoholic bev- 
era<^e. The casein curd is finely broken up and partially 
digested. Kumyss has been imitated in America by adding 



192 ANIMAL FOODS 

yeast to milk and allowing fermentation to proceed twenty- 
four hours or over. 

Kefir was made originally from cows' milk with a leaven 
of kumyss. This has been sold in tablet form like the ren- 
net ferment. Kefir resembles kumyss so closely that no 
further description is necessary. 

Matzoon differs from the preceding chiefly in containing 
no alcohol. 

Modified Milk is milk containing definite proportions of 
fat, sugar, proteids, etc., put up usually according to the 
formula of a physician, who prescribes the quantity of the 
different constituents he desires. 

For sick children and in convalescence it is of great value 
to obtain a modification in which the composition is definite 
and accurate. It can then be known what mixtures will agree 
with the patient. 

Malted Milk is a pure food prepared from rich full-cream 
milk, combined with the valuable nutritive extracts of malted 
barley and wheat. This product being highly concentrated 
and partially predigested, supplies a large amount of nutrition 
with little tax upon the digestive organs. It is a valuable 
nutrient in dyspepsia or impaired digestion, for fever and 
wasting diseases, the convalescent, nursing mothers, and the 
aged. 

Peptonised Milk is milk in which the casein or curd has 
been made soluble and diffusible by means of the Peptonising 
Tubes. In these Peptonising Tubes, extractum pancreatis*^ 
containing the pancreatic ferment which acts especially upon 
the proteins of milk, is combined with soda bicarbonate in 
due proportion, and each tube contains sufficient peptonisincr 
powder to peptonise a pint of milk. Milk may be peptonised 
by various methods — by the "cold process," "immediate 
process,'' "warm process," etc. The method and degree of 
peptonisation suitable for any special case is soon determined 
by experience, by the agreeability of the milk and its digesti- 
bility. 

Condensed Milk. Preservation of milk by condensation 



MIU^ AXD MILK PRODUCTS 193 

constitutes a very extensive eonunercial industry. There are 
several processes in vogue, and the product is either sweet- 
ened or unsweetened. Ordinary unsweetened condensed milk 
contains about 12 per cent, each of protein and fat and 16 per 
cent, of the native milk sugar, making the total solids 40 per 
cent. Cane sugar may be added to the amount of about 40 per 
cent. more, making the total solids 80 per cent. 

Dry Milk is milk in powdered form from which all of the 
water has been removed. The resulting powder is milk in its 
most concentrated, digestible and nutritious form. Dry milk 
having part of the butter fat removed (12% in the dry state), 
has been found to be best suited for infants and those suf- 
fering from impaired digestion. It is most valuable in mal- 
nutrition, vomiting and other infant feeding troubles as 
well as in febrile conditions, such as, typhoid, pneumonia ; 
also in empyema, osteomyelitis and suppurative conditions. 

Evaporated Milk is made of pure milk, fresh from the 
cow, nothing taken from it to lessen its nourishing qualities 
and nothing added. It is sterilized by the application of a 
liigher degree of heat than is used in ordinary pasteurization.

PASTEURIZATION 
Metliods of Preparing. Put bottle into kettle of cold 
water and slowly bring to the boiling point. Boil ten minutes. 
After which fill immediately nearly full with milk ; cork with 
absorbent cotton which has been baked in the oven until a 
delicate brown. Place bottles on a rest in a deep pan so that 
they will not touch bottom, and fill the pan with cold water to 
reach as high as the milk, in bottles. Heat water gradually to 
145 degrees Fahrenheit, or until small bubbles appear in 
the milk next to the glass. Eemove to back of stove and keep 
milk at same temperature 20 to 30 minutes; then cool 



194 ANIMAL FOODS 

quickly to 45 degrees or lower. To cool rapidly put bottlea 
first into lukewarm water and then cold water until milk iS 
cold, then surround with ice water. Keep in cold place and 
do not remove stoppers until ready to use. Note Pasteuriza- 
tion, page 188. 

Utensils. A convenient form of apparatus for pasteuriza- 
tion can be purchased or a covered tin pail answers well for 
the larger vessel, and an inverted pie pan with perforated 
bottom can serve as the false bottom. A hole may be punched 
in the cover of the pail, a cork inserted and a chemical 
thermometer put through the cork so that the bulb dips in 
the water, thus enabling one to watch the temperature closely 
without removing the cover, or an ordinary dairy ther- 
mometer may be used from time to time by removing 
the lid. 

STERILIZATION 

The utensils and methods to sterilize milk are the same an 
for pasteurizing, except that the water is heated to the boil- 
ing point (212° F.) and the time for boiling is ten or more 
minutes. Note Sterilization, page 188. 

EVAPORATED MILK 
It is sometimes of advantage, as in cases of dilated stom- 
ach or whenever the total amount of fluids must be cut down 
to a given point, to heat the milk in a pan over which is 
placed an inverted funnel. Much of the water of the milk 
passes off as vapor, while the solids remain in the pan. 

BAKED MILK 

Into a stone jar put one-half gallon of sweet milk; cover 
with writing paper and tie it on. Bake in moderate oven 
nine to ten hours. It will be the consistency of thick cream.

Warm Process 

Put one-half cup (gill) of cold water and the powder con- 
tained in one of the Peptonising Tubes (Fairchild) into a 
clean quart bottle and shake thoroughly; add a pint of cold 
fresh milk and shake again; then place the bottle in a pail 
or kettle of warm water — about 115° F., or not too hot to 
immerse the whole hand in it without discomfort. Keep 
the bottle in the water bath for five or ten minutes, or longer 
if it is desired to peptonise the milk quite completely, then 
put it immediately on ice — directly in contact with the ice 
- — in order to check the process of digestion and keep the milk 
trom spoiling. 

The degree of peptonisation is very simply regulated in 
ihis process by the length of time during which the milk is 
kept in the water bath. It is seldom necessary to peptonise 
milk until it hecomes hitter. 

PARTIALLY PEPTONISED MILK, 338 CALORIES 

Put one-half cup (gill) of cold water and the powder con-

should be so applied that the milk will come to a boil in ten 
minutes. Let it cool to about lukewarm, then strain into a 
clean bottle or glass jar, cork tightly and keep in a cold 
place. The bottle or jar should always be well shaken before 
?nd after pouring out a portion. The milk may be taken 
cold or hot as the physician may direct. 

"Partially peptonised milk" if properly prepared will not 
become bitter.

SWEETBREADS 

Among epicures sweetbreads are considered a dainty and 
are certainly a most acceptable food for the sick, as they are 
easily digested, but they must not be used to excess on account 
of the large amount of uric acid which they produce. 

Definition. Sweetbreads are the pancreas and thymus 
glands of the calf, the word being used for either one or 
both organs. The thymus glands are removed and used for 
food while the animal lives on milk. The pancreas of the 
calf is sometimes called stomach sweetbread, and the thymus 
gland the neck or throat sweetbread. The latter is con- 
sidered somewhat more easily digested than the former. 

Digestibility. It is an error to state that sweetbreads are 
more digestible because they contain digestive ferments in 
life, for these are destroyed by cooking. The tenderness of 
these bodies is due doubtless to the delicate character of the 
connective tissue, and to the soft character of the gland tis- 
sue itself, which is rich in nucleo-protein. The presence of 



SWEETBREADS 201 

this nuclein is objectionable for gouty and other patients 
with uric acid disorders, but this is no contraindication for 
an occasional use of them by invalids.

(To Parboil.) 
Eemove from paper as soon as received from market, plunge 
into cold water and allow to stand one hour. Drain. Place 
immediately in boiling water salted water to cover, allowing 
one-half tablespoon each of salt and vinegar to a pair of 
sweetbreads. Simmer twenty minutes; again drain and 
plunge into cold water that they may keep white and firm. 
Free from membrane fat and veins, and serve as desired. 

Sweetbreads are always prepared in this way for subse- 
quent cooking and are spoken of as parboiled.

GELATIN , 

Source. Gelatin is a nitrogenous food classed with pro- 
teins, under the division called gelatinoids or albuminoids, and 
derived from " collagen," the chief constituent of connective 
tissue with its various modifications, as tendons, the " chondri- 
gen" of cartilage, or the "ossein" of bone. "By proper 
treatment, any form of connective tissue can be made to yield 
gelatin. Hide clippings yield glue, a crude form of gelatin, 
and much commercial gelatin is simply a purified glue, derived 
from such a source. Isinglass, obtained from the swimming 
bladder of the sturgeon and other fish, is the purest form of 
gelatin ; the gelatin obtained from calves' feet is also of high 
quality." ^ 

General Principles in Cooling. Gelatin is insoluble m 
cold water, but when allowed to stand in it will swell from 
absorption of water. "Gelatin is very soluble in boiling 
water, and on cooling sets into a jelly. This jellying will 
occur in a solution containing as little as 1 per cent, of 
gelatin."^ Gelatin is decomposed by boiling and conse- 
quently if allowed to boil will not solidify on cooling. 

Digestibility. Gelatin is very easily digested in the stom- 
ach, and readily absorbed from the small intestines. 

Nutritive Value. Although gelatin is a protein food, it 
cannot alone support life. Proteins are made up of groups 
of amino acids, most of which it seems necessary to have 
represented in the diet, to secure complete repair of the waste 
of nitrogenous tissue. In gelatin two important acids are 
lacking ; hence not more than two-thirds of the day's nitrogen 
requirement should be given in the form of gelatin. Because 
it can to this extent take the place of other proteins, gelatin 
has often been called a "protein-sparer," but it is a true

ment Station. Food and Drug Products, 1909. Being Part II of the 
Biennial Report of 1909-1910. 



204 ANIMAL FOODS 

protein. In the ordinary intake of animal food, not more 
than one-eighth of the total nitrogen is in the form of gelatin. 
It is usually not convenient to take more than 25 to 30 
grams (about 1 ounce) in a day. Six ounces of calf's foot 
jelly (which would be a large helping) contain less than half 
an ounce of gelatin. Jellying will occur in a solution con- 
taining as little as 1 per cent, of gelatin. Gelatin has the 
advantage (along with other proteins) of fixing a good deal 
of acid in the process of stomach digestion and is thus of 
service in cases of hyperacidity of the stomach, when given 
in other forms than acid jellies. It seems also to promote 
the secretion of gastric juice. It is useful in febrile states 
as it really belongs with liquid foods, melting as it does at 
body temperature. 

In convalescence, acid jellies (orange, lemon, etc.,) are of 
service as a pleasant supplement to the ordinary diet, but the 
actual nutriment which they supply is small. 

Extra nutriment can be added to gelatin by combining it 
with eggs and milk, as in Snow Pudding, Charlottes of 
various kinds, Spanish Cream, etc., all of which are attrac- 
tive forms of invalid diet. 

Meat Jellies are condensed form of broth, and are prepared 
by taking any meat containing a large proportion of connec- 
tive tissues and cooking long and slowly. (Xote broths, page 
217 for directions and recipes.) Home-made jellies, prop- 
erly prepared, have a pleasing flavor and are an agreeable 
addition to diet of an invalid, although their nutritive value 
is low.

BEEF PREPARATIONS 

BEEF JUICE — BEEF TEA — RAW BEEF 
BEEF JUICE 

Composition. The juice of meat contains some protein, in 
addition to salts and extractives. 

General Principles in Cooking. From raw meat we can- 
not obtain as much meat juice as is easily taken from the same 
amount of meat when pre\dously heated. 

1 Calculated without fruit. 



BEEF PREPARATIOXS 213. 

The reason for this is that the envelope enclosing the 
muscular tissue is a tough substance, whicli swells and dis- 
solves when healed, yielding gelatin, and the liquid portion 
of the meat is easily expressed. If cooked too long the pro- 
tein largely coagulates and the meat loses most of its moisture 
and becomes tough. 

A steak thoroughly heated through swells, and when cut 
the liquid portion flows out readily. One pound of meat 
vields about four ounces of juice. 

Care in Serving. In administering beef juice great care 
should be taken in reheating not to heat it above 136 degrees 
Fahrenheit, at which temperature albumin coagulates in 
flakes. 

Substitutes for Beef Juice. Prepared extracts of good 
make may be used to advantage with beef juice to add flavor 
and make it more appetizing. 

Absorption. Beef juice is readily absorbed. It has very 
little food value but is useful where the stimulating effect due 
to its extractives is desirable. 

Comparative Food Value of Beef Juice and Beef Tea. 
Beef juice, although fourteen times as rich in protein as 
beef tea, is raw in flavor, and is rejected by many palates. 
In such a case, add a small quantity of beef tea or prepared 
beef extract for flavor. 

Thus by the union of two bodies, one rich in protein and 
the other rich in flavor, we have a superior preparation. Pre- 
pare a small quantity at a time, as it does not keep well. 

BEEF TEA 

Composition. Meat treated with hot water contains only a 
small percentage of solids and almost no protein, but consists 
chiefly of nitrogenous extractives and soluble mineral matter 
and water. The clear liquid which remains when the coagu- 
lated albumin is strained out of beef tea contains only ex- 
tractive or flavoring substances with the soluble mineral mat- 
ter of the meat. Therefore it should not be strained, and if 



2U ANIMAL FOODS 

properly prepared the albumin will not be coagulated to so 
great an extent. 

Even in strong beef tea which is carefully made the amount 
of protein present has been found to be less than two per cent. 

Nutritive Value. Beef tea is valuable in the sick room not 
as a food, but because of its appetizing flavor and stimulating 
qualities. 

Beef Extracts are prepared in both liquid and solid form. 
They have very little nutritive value, containing but four to 
five per cent, of protein, but are useful for their flavor and as 
stimulants. They are used to advantage in combination with 
beef juice, adding flavor and making it more palatable and ap- 
petizing, 

RAW BEEF 

UncooJced Meat. Eaw meat is not quite as easily digested 
as cooked meat, and owing to color and flavor is not appetiz" 
ing, and could not be taken continuously. However, wheD 
ckopped fine, or scraped free from connective tissue, it ie\ 
very readily digested and can be served disguised or very 
slightly cooked in many dainty ways. 

Comparative Food Value of Raw Beef and Beef Tea. It 
can readily be seen that raw meat served chopped fine or 
scraped contains all the nutriment of the meat, whereas beef 
tea as seen from the manner of preparation, contains only the 
extractives and soluble mineral matter of meat.

BROTH AND MEAT JELLIES 

Broth is a liquid containing the juices of soluble parts of 
meat and bone, which have been extracted by long, slow cook- 
ing. 

This liquid is more or less solid when cold, according to the 
gelatinous nature of the ingredients. It varies greatly in 
quantity, according to the manner in which it is prepared 
and the material used. The cheaper, inferior parts of meat 
yield more nutriment than the expensive cuts. 

Composition. Broth contains almost no protein. It con- 
sists chiefly of extractives, and soluble mineral matter with 
a little gelatine. 

Objective Point and General Principles in Cooking. The 
chief object in making broth is to obtain the largest possible 
amount of nutriment from the meat. This is best accom- 
plished by observing the following rules: 



218 ANIMAL FOODS 

Cut meat into small pieces. 

Soak in the cold water before heating. 

Use a careful selection and proportion of meat, bone and 
water. (The usual proportion is one pint of water to one 
pound of meat.) 

Season judiciously. 

Use steam-tight kettle; simmer (not boil), that the juice 
may be fully extracted. 

Make it the day before using, that the fat may be removed 
more easily. 

Long, slow cooking. 

Broth may be made from beef, mutton or chicken. Eice, 
barley, white or whole egg, etc., may be added, if allowed, to 
increase the quantity of nourishment. 

Comparative Value of Broth and Beef Tea. Broth differs 
from beef tea in that it contains gelatin, besides the extrac- 
tives or ilavoring substances and soluble mineral matter that 
are found in beef tea. Gelatin is obtained from meat and 
bones by long, slow cooking, and it is useful in convalescence 
and in febrile states. (Xote " Gelatin," p. 203.) 

Meat Jellies are a condensed form of broth, which form an 
agreeable way of serving broth to an invalid. Although they 
contain little nourishment they are appetizing and stimulat- 
ing.

1 teaspoon salt. 

Wipe meat, remove skin and fat and cut into small pieces. 
Put in a kettle with bones that have been well broken, add 
cold water and let it stand one-half hour to extract the juices. 
Heat gradually to boiling point, skim, and when partly cooked 
season with salt and pepper. Simmer four hours, or until 
meat is tender. Do not allow it to boil. Eemove fat and 
stiain through a coarse sieve. Serve hot. If broth is made 
the day before it is used, it can be cooled thoroughly and 
the fat be removed easily. In reheating use double boiler. 
Two tablespoons of cooked rice or barley may be added if 
desired. The barley should be soaked over night or several 
hours before cooking. Taste and season before serving, a tea- 
spoon of chopped parsley may be added just before seiving 
if desired. 

Xote. — For weaker broth, use one quart of water to one 
pound of meat.

hours, or until meat is tender. When half-cooked skim off 
fat and add the rice and seasonings (and if desired, a small 
onion). When meat is tender, skim off fat and strain, taste 
and season properly and serve hot. When possible, make 
"broth the day before using, that it may be thoroughly cooled 
and the fat removed easily. Eeheat in a double boiler. The 
rice may be cooked, and rubbed through strainer before add- 
ing to broth, or it may be omitted if desired. An old fowl, 
not too fat, is best for broth.

EGG BROTH 

If one cannot conveniently get protein from meat, a broth 
may be made bv means of hot water into which an egg has 
been stirred. Heat three tablespoons of water to not above 
149 degrees F. (below the simmering point), and pour it 
gradually into a raw egg. The liquid is milky if the yolk is 
used ; clear if only the white is used. It has little taste, which 
is an advantage with many patients. This broth may be 
flavored with beef extract or hot prepared broth may be used 
in place of the hot water.

3 pounds chicken. 8 peppercorns. 

1 quart cold water. Salt. 

Prepare chicken as for chicken broth and cut flesh and 
bone into small pieces. Put into saucepan with cold water 
and peppercorns and let stand one-half hour. Bring slowly 
to the boiling point, remove scum and cook five or six hours 
or until meat is very tender and water is reduced to one pint, 
while cooking keep it below the boiling point. Skim fre- 
quently while cooking, strain through double thickness of 
cheese-cloth, season to taste and let stand until firm. Ee- 
move fat, reheat and turn into glass fruit jars or individual 
molds and cool ; put in ice box until jellied. 

Additional flavor may be added if desired, a stalk of celery 
or a small piece of bay leaf may be cooked with the chicken. 

Note. — Mutton Broth Jelly may be treated in the same 
way. 

BEEF JELLY 
3 pounds solid meat from the 4 quarts cold water, 
shoulder or shin. 2 teaspoons salt.

SOUP AND SOUP ACCOMPANIMENTS 

Soup is a light and suitable form of food for the sick. 
There are two classes — those made with meat and those 
without meat. 

The soups with meat are an infusion of meat, flavored with 
salt and some condiment. They are treated in the chapter 
on broths. 

The foundations of soups without meat are milk, vegetables 
and water. They are dainty and nutritious, and an excellent 
way of serving milk and the starch and mineral matter of the 
vegetable. 

They may be served as a luncheon, with crisp crackers, or as 
the first course of a dinner. Serve daintily in heated bouillon 
cups, partly filled, on small plate and doily. 

General Rule for blending: 

(a) Prepare vegetables, cook and strain. 

(6) Prepare cream sauce: Melt butter, add the flour and 
gradually pour on the scalded milk or water. Cook thor- 
oughly. 

(c) Blend .(a) and (&). Season, strain and serve imme- 
diately. 

In the preparation of these soups great care must be taken 
that the starch of the vegetable and of the flour used in the 
thickening is thoroughly cooked. Cooking temperature of 
starch is 212 degrees Fahrenlieit.

CHAPTER X 
VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

The important food products derived from the vegetable 
kingdom are the Cereals, Legumes — Eoots and Tubers — 
Green Vegetables — Fruits — Xuts — Fungi — Lichens. 

Composition. Vegetable or plant foods contain the five 
proximate principles, namely, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, 
water and mineral matter. In this they resemble animal 
foods. The food principles in the two classes are, however, 
in different proportions, animal foods being rich in proteins 
or fats, and seldom containing carbohydrate in appreciable 
amounts; while vegetable foods are, as a rule, rich in carbo- 
hydrates, and poor in proteins and fats. 

These differences are clearly shown in the following table: 

Pro. Fat. Carb. 
% % % 
Lean round of beef. Free from all vis- 
ible fat 23.2 2.5 

Lean round of beef. Very fat 16.1 23.1 .... 

Wheat flour (entire wheat) 13.8 1.9 71.9 

Potatoes 1.8 0.1 14.7 

Apples 1.6 2.2 66.1 

The legumes and most nuts are exceptional in containing 
high percentages of protein or fat or both, but unlike meats, 
they also contain a very considerable amount of carbohydrate, 
as shown bv tlie following analyses : 

Pro. Fat. Carb. 

% % % 

Beans, dried 22.5 1.8 59.6 

Peas 24.6 1.0 62.0 

Almonds 21.0 54.9 17.3 

Walnuts 16.6 63.4 16.1 

231 



232 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

Protein. (1) Gluten of wheat and some of the other 
cereals. (2) Leguniin found in legumes. (3) Vegetable 
albumin as found in some vegetables. 

Carbohydrates of Vegetables include — starch, sugar, veg- 
etable gums and cellulose. 

Fats of Vegetables are in the form of oils and are similar 
in composition to animal fats, but are more easily digested 
and equal in nutritive value. 

Vi'ater. Dry vegetable foods, such as cereals, dried beans 
and peas, nuts, dried fruits, etc., do not, as a rule, contain 
as much water as animal foods, but fresh vegetables and fruits 
contain frequently from 90 per cent, to 95 per cent, of water. 

This gives them a low nutritive value compared with their 
bulk. In cooking, water is added to most dry vegetable foods, 
so that when served they resemble fresh or succulent vegetable 
foods in this respect. 

Mineral Matter. All vegetable foods contain valuable ash 
constituents. In cereals, these are largely in the outer part 
of the grain, and are lost if the entire grain is not utilized. 
Thus polished rice is much poorer in ash constituents than 
unpolished; and wliite flour than entire wheat flour. Fresh 
vegetables and fruits are desirable in the dietary for their 
salts and organic acids. 

Vitamines. The leafy vegetables are one source of the fat- 
soluble vitamine, the lack of which prevents growth and proper 
nutrition. The water-soluble vitamine is found in whole 
grains, legumes and green vegetables. Fresh vegetables and 
fruits are also valuable for their antiscorbutic ' properties. 

Digestibility. Vegetable foods are less easily digested than 
animal foods, owing to their complex composition, and espe- 
cially to the intimate mixture of the nutrients with cellulose. 
This prevents the digestive ferments acting readily upon the 
food-stuffs so that they are digested more slowly and less com- 
pletely than animal foods. Although cellulose is indigestible, 
its presence under normal conditions in proper amounts, is 
advantageous, but it should be thoroughly softened by cook- 
ing, except in the case of tender young vegetables such as 
lettuce. 

1 See section on Vitauiinos, pa^o 22. 



CEREALS 233 

Co-m/paraiive Value of Animal and Vegetable Diets. An 
animal diet is concentrated and easily digested. If the ani- 
mal foods taken are eggs and milk, no serious objection can 
be urged against them, except that they lack bulk. The food 
is so fully absorbed that the large intestine has no stimulus 
to action and no material for its muscles to act upon, and 
serious complications are likely to arise from constipation. 
If the animal food is largely meat, it is undesirable, not only 
for the reason above mentioned, but because excessive quan- 
tities of nitrogenous extractives are taken, which are likely 
to cause uric acid disorders and other disturbances, and also 
because important mineral salts are lacking (such as calcium, 
which carnivorous animals get by eating hone) ; and because 
the acids formed from the protein (phosphoric and sulphuric) 
tend to deprive the body of salts already present in the tissues. 
A strict vegetable diet, on the other hand, while free from 
these objections, is necessarily very bulky, owing to the high 
percentages of water and cellulose, and to the fact that extra 
allowance must be made because it is less perfectly absorbed. 
\'egetable proteins are not of as high biological value as animal 
proteins, and, unless special care is taken, a vegetable diet is 
also likely to be low in protein. Legumes and nuts must form 
a considerable part of the dietary to prevent this. When Qgg^, 
milk and milk products are added to the vegetable foods, the 
diet becomes mixed, and these objections no longer hold. 

An Ideal Viet contains a mixture of animal and vegetable 
foods, so that protein, fat, carbohydrate and mineral matter 
are supplied in proper proportions and in available forms, and 
sufi&cient bulk is afforded for proper intestinal action. 

CEREALS 

GRUELS — BREAKFAST FOODS — STARCHY JELLIES — MACA- 
RONI 

Wherever it is possible to grow grains, they are staples of 
man's diet. Xo food products of the vegetable kingdom equal 
them in importance. They are cheaply and easily grown, and 
contain all the food principles in unusually good proportion. 



234 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

They can be kept for long periods, are not difficult to cook, 
and furnish a palatable and digestible article of diet. Cereals 
alone supply nearly one-fourth of the total food in a large 
number of the American families. Wheat, corn, rye, oats, 
barley, rice and buckwheat are in commonest use. 

The natural grain is surrounded by an indigestible husk 
which is always removed. Grains dimply hulled or husked, 
and slightly crushed are called groats or grits; more finely 
crushed, they constitute meal ; ground to a powder and sifted 
they form flour. 

Composition. Cereals contain all the food principles, with 
considerable cellulose, especially in the outer skin, which forms 
bran in milling. They are comparatively dry materials, hav- 
ing an average water content of about 10 per cent. The pro- 
tein content is fairly high, averaging 12 per cent.-13 per cent.^ 
The fat is never large in amount, and varies within wide 
limits, being greatest in corn and oats and their products, and 
lowest in rice. 

The nutrients in largest proportion are the carbohydrates, 
which frequently constitute 75 per cent, of the whole. The 
ash content is as large as in most common food materials, and 
some of the grains, as oats and wheat, are especially valuable 
for their soluble phosphates of calcium, potassium, magne- 
sium, etc. 

The chemical composition of some of the most common 
cereals is shown in the following table : 

Carbohydrates 

Wafer Protein Fat Starch, etc. Crude Fiber Ash 

Percent. Per Cent. Per Cent. Per Cent. Per Cent. Per Cent 

Barley .... .10.9 12.4 1.8 69.8 2.7 24 ' 

Corn (maize) ... 9.3 9.9 2.8 74.9 1 4 i i

Rice ..... .12.4 7.4 0.4 79.2 0.2 0.4 

Wheat (spring) ..10.4 12.5 2.2 71.2 1.8 llg 

It will be seen that corn is relatively rich in fat ; oats in 
both protein and fat ; rye and wheat in protein with a mod- 
erate amount of fat; rice is notably free from crude fiber 
and fat, and also very low in ash.

tin ^o. 249, Agricultural Dept., Washington, D. C. 



CEREALS 23^ 

Cereal Breakfa-sl Foods are very similar in composition to 

the grains fromwliic-h they are made, except that finely milled 

cereals contain little cellulose and are relatively poor iji ash. 

Macaroni is much like wheat breakfast foods in composition 

and food value. 

Principles in Cooking. Cooking improves cereals in many 
ways. For the average person, proper cooking has almost as 
much to do with the nutriment finally obtained as the pro- 
portions of nutrients originally present. Flavor and appear- 
ance are improved, with the gain in digestibility that comes 
from appetizing foods which stimulate the flow of digestive 
juices. Cooking to convert nutrients into more digestible 
forms, is very important in the case of cereals which contain 
so much starch ; and since the starch in these foods is sur- 
rounded by cell-walls of crude fiber (largely cellulose) upon 
which the digestive juices are unable to act, these walls must 
be broken down. Part of this disintegration may be accom- 
plished in milling, and part by thorough mastication but com- 
plete digestion of the starch is assured only by thorough 
cooking. 

Parching is one of the simplest methods of cooking grains. 
The invisible moisture in the cells is expanded by the heat, 
and the cell walls burst. Some of the starch is also made 
soluble or changed to dextrin by this process. The digestibil- 
ity of protein seems to be lessened by cooking at high teni- 
peratures, but the starch can be made almost perfectly di- 
gestible. 

The softening of cellulose i.: more perfectly accomplished 
by cooking for a long time in the presence of a large amount 
of moisture, as in steaming, or cooking with water or milk 
in a double boiler. The glutinous material which surrounds 
the starch grains and prevents their digestion is disintegrated 
so that the digestive juices can act. In general, the more 
crude fiber a cereal contains, the longer it should be cooked. 
Eeference to the table (p. 234) shows that oats requires 
more cooking than rice; whole or ;->artially crushed grains 
than finely ground ones. There i: danger in undercooked 
cereals, not only of loss of valuable nutriment through failure 



23G VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

of digestion, but in irritation of the alimentary tract. This 
should be especially remembered in preparing partially cooked 
breakfast foods. 

When cereals are cooked in water some of it is absorbed, 
and soluble substances in the food pass into the remaining 
water. If this is thrown away, as when rice is boiled in a 
large quantity of water and subsequently drained dry, a con- 
siderable part of the nutriment is lost. Kice water frequently 
contains enough dissolved starch to form a jelly on cooling. 
Por this reason steaming is a preferable method. Practical 
application of the fact that certain nutrients in cereals are 
soluble is made in the preparation of all kinds of cereal 
waters and starchy jellies. (See Recipes, pp. 124-244.) 

Gruels are thin porridges made from flour or other finely 
ground grain products, with either water or milk. They are 
cooked for a long time until the starch grains are thoroughly 
ruptured and the starch passes into a condition of " colloidal " 
or semi-solution. It is then much more easily acted on by 
the digestive juices. The time of cooking should therefore be 
conscientiously kept by the clock. 

By passing the material through a cheese-cloth or sieve, the 
coarser, undissolved portions are removed, and the smooth 
l)rcduct does not irritate weakened digestive organs; hence 
tliis method is desirable for invalids and young children. 

In cooking all cereal products, the following points sliould 
he observed : Use a double boiler. Observe the correct pro- 
])ortions of cereal, water and salt. 
Cook at boiling temperature (212° P.). 
Watch the time by the clock, and always cook the full time 
prescribed, preferably longer. 
Serve attractively. 

Improper cooking and poor serving are largely responsible 
for unpopularity of cereal foods. 

Digestibility. The digestibility of cereals is greatly in- 
fluenced by the mode of preparation and the thoroughness of 
insalivation. Por the normal healthy person cereal foods are 
very wholesome. In general, about 90 per cent, or more of 



CEREALS 237 

-the organic matter is assimilated. The carbohydrates are 
most completely digested; the protein shows a wide variation, 
but is less perfectly assimilated than the other nutrients, 
owing partly to the fact that it is often hardened in cooking 
and partly 'that it is intimately bound up with cellulose m 
the bran coats. For this reason white flour shows a higher 
degree of digestibility for protein, than do whole wheat prepa- 

^^ Nutritive Value. Cereals supply actual digestible nutri- 
ments to the body more cheaply than any other class of foods 
except the dried legumes. All animal foods, especially meats, 
are more expensive, even as sources of protein, than cereals 
A glance at their composition shows that they are chiefly fuel 
foods, because of their high carbohydrate content. Their 
cost varies with the cost of labor and fuel in preparing the 
food The comparatively expensive ready-to-eat breakfast 
foods do not vield any extra nutritive value. Their only ad- 
vantages are" pleasant flavor and ease of serving. Cereal 
products yield on the average between 1600 and ITOO calories 
per "pound. Thus:

placed bv sweetina or saccharin. It is many times sweeter 
than sugar but it has no food value. :N"ote Sugar Substitutes,

1 lb. entire wheat flour furnishes 1675 calories. 

1 lb. corn meal furnishes 1655 calories. 

1 lb. cornstarch furnishes 1675 calories. 

1 lb. wheatlet furnishes 1685 calories.

Care of Cereals. Cereals must be kept in a cool, dry place; 
warmth will favor the development of the maggot eggs; and 
moisture, when absorbed, makes them musty.

delicious eaten with oatmeal. They should be served with the 
mush, and sugar and cream poured over the whole. They 
give the acid flavor which so many crave in the morning. 
Coarse oatmeal is not advisable in any form of water brash, 
acidity or bowel irritations. It often causes eruptions on the 
skin in warm weather.

BREAD -^^7 



BREAD 



From the most remote times, bread has been an important 
part of the diet of mankind. It is to-day probably more gen- 
erally and extensively used than any other one food-stuff, 
with the possible exception of milk. It is therefore extremely 
important to know what constitutes good bread and what are 
its nutritive properties. 

Composition. The ingredients of bread are very simple — 
flour, water, yeast and salt. Any cereal, cleaned, crushed and 
sifted to a powder, may serve as the flour, but wheat flour 
makes the most satisfactory bread, because its proteins in 
the form of gluten have more elasticity than those of other 
cereals. 

" Bread contains from 34 to 40 per cent, of water, and the 
remainder, about 60 per cent, at least, is nutritive material. 
It contains a large amount of carbohydrates, a moderate 
amount of protein, a small amount of mineral matter, and 
almost no fat. Bread could not serve as the sole article of 
diet, because in order to supply enough fuel, protein, and asli 
constituents one would have to eat an impossibly large amount, 
and the diet would still be deficient in vitamines. The ad- 
dition of other foods to increase the protein and ash content 
of the diet decreases the bulk necessary. ^lost methods of in- 
creasing the protein contents of bread have a tendency to in- 
crease the cost, but skim milk can be used in place of water in 
the mixing with little added expense, and it will add about 2 
per cent, increase as to protein/" 

Digestibility and Xutritive Value. "The nutritive value 
of bread depends, not only on its chemical composition, but 
also on its digestibility, and digestibility in its turn seems 
to depend largely on the lightness of the loaf. It is the

gluten in a dough which gives it the power of stretching 
and rising as the gas from the yeast expands within it, and 
hence of making a light loaf. Kye has less gluten proteids 
than wheat, while barley, oats and maize have none, so that 
they do not make a light, porous loaf like wheat. It is pos- 
sible that of the various kinds of wheat flour those con- 
taining a large part of the bran — entire wheat and graham 
flours — furnish the body with more mineral matter than 
fine white flour; but it is not certain that the extra amount 
of mineral matter furnished is of the same value as that from 
tlie interior of the grain. They do not yield more digestible 
protein than the white flours, as was for a time supposed. 
It seems safe to say that, as far as is known, for a given 
amount of money, white flour yields the most actual nourish- 
ment with the various food ingredients in good proportion. 

" It should be remembered, however, that all kinds of bread 
are wholesome if of good quality, and the use of several 
kinds is an easy means of securing variety in the diet." ^ As 
compared with most meats and vegetables, bread has prac- 
tically no waste, and is very completely digested. Few foods 
yield so much energy for so little money. A diet of bread 
and milk can be perfectly balanced and will be tired of less 
easily than any other equally simple diet. 

All bread-stuffs should be eaten slowly and thoroughly 
masticated, in order that time may be given for the saliva 
to act upon the starch. For if the stomach is hampered with 
quantities of unchanged starch it cannot perform its work 
without effort. Fermentation results or the intestines have 
more than their share of work to do and rebel. If these foods 
were eaten slowly much of the resultant dyspepsia would be 
avoided. 

Bread Substitutes. When, for any reason, persons are 
curtailed in the use of starch in a diet, as in diabetes, they 
find it a great privation to do without bread, and an acceptable 
substitute may be used. However, a diabetic bread should 
never be prescribed without a knowledge of its content of 
carbohydrates, protein and fat.

BREAD 249 

Gluten Bread. Gluten flour is prepared by washing the 
starch wholly or in part from wheat flour. The grayish, 
tough, elastic, stick-y mass left after this process is largely 
gluten. The washed gluten dried and ground is called gluten 
flour. It contains considerable starch, so that it is necessary 
for the physician to know the exact composition of the brand 
emploved so as to insure good results. 

Bran Bread. Bran is now extensively used in the diet of 
diabetic patients. If made with bacon fat, butter or eggs the 
flavor is much improved. Bran often contains a considerable 
quantitv of starch. This may be washed by putting bran in 
cheesecloth and washed under cold water tap until water is 

clear. 

Soy Bean Bread. Soy bean or soy beau flour contains a 
small amount of sugar, but few foods so valuable to the dia- 
betic contain so little, and the flour is used to great advantage 
in diabetics. The average composition is water 107c, pro- 
tein 35%, fat 18%, sugar 8 or 9% and the remainder is made 
up of fiber and non-nitrogenous extract. One ounce con- 
tains 13 grams of protein and 120 calories. 

Sugar Suhstitutes. Sweetina, or saccharine tablets may 
be used to sweeten bread substitutes or for any food needin.u- 
sweetening for the diabetic. To one bottle of "sweetina" 
add one pint water of which one teaspoon is equal to one pint 
of sugar. Dissolve one half grain " saccharine " in one tea- 
spoon water or one " saccharine tablet " in two tablespoons of 

water. 

Bread-Making. The two practical methods of making 
bread are with yeast (fermented bread) and with cream of 
tartar and bicarbonate of soda (unfermented bread). 

Fermented Bread. The raising or leavening of bread is 
usually brought about by allowing yeast to develop in it. 
Yeast is an exceedingly minute form of plant life, which, 
when given food, flour, moisture and warmth, grows; and 
bv this growth produces carbon dioxide and alcohol. 
' The carbon dioxide, in its effort to escape, puffs up the 
flour dough, but owing to the viscous nature of the gluten 
(the elastic, strength-giving substances of flour) it is caught 
and retained. 



250 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

Each little bubble of gas occupies a certain space, and 
when the bread is baked the walls around these spaces harden 
and tlie result is a porous loaf. The alcohol escapes into the 
oven in the baking. 

To bake bread requires a hot oven. 

The bread should continue to rise for about fifteen min- 
utes after being placed in the oven, then the rising should 
cease and the loaf begin to brown. 

We bake bread to kill the yeast plant, to render the starch 
more digestible, to expel the alcohol and carbon dioxide and to 
form a nice flavored crust. 

The making of good bread requires care and intelligence 
on the part of the cook. Use a good brand of flour, fresh 
yeast, remembering that yeast is a plant and must be put at 
a proper temperature to grow. Watch each process carefully. 

"Lightness and sweetness of bread depends as much on 
the way in which it is made as on the materials used. The 
greatest care should be used in preparing and baking the 
dough and in cooking and keeping the finished bread." 

Unfermented Bread. ' Carbon dioxide is obtained to lighten 
bread by causing cream of tartar and bicarbonate of soda to 
unite chemically. 

To one part soda use two parts cream of tartar. When 
given moisture and heat carbon dioxide is obtained. 

Baking powder is a combination of the follow'iig in- 
gredients : 

Bicarbonate of soda 84 grammes 

Cream of tartar 188 grammes

TOAST 2oo 

Tie bran in cheese-cloth and wash thoroughly by fastening 
on to the water tap, until the water comes away clear. The 
bran should be frequently kneaded so that all parts come in 
contact with the water. Wring dry. Mix bran, well beaten 
whole eggs, butter and salt. Beat the egg white very stiff and 
fold in at the last. Shape with knife and tablespoon into 
three dozen small cakes. If desired one-half a gram of cin- 
namon or other flavoring may be added. Each cake contains : 
j)rotein, 0.5 grams; fat, 1.0 gram; calories, 11. 

BUTTER BALLS 

1 teaspoon butter = 36 Calories. 

Cut butter in small pieces size of balls desired, and put 
in ice-water. Soak the butter paddles in boiling water ten 
minutes, then chill in ice-water. Hold a paddle firmly in 
the left hand and roll each piece of butter with the right 
paddle until round. If butter sticks it must be chilled longer, 
or paddles must be rubbed with salt and reheated. 

One pound of butter will make about thirty balls. 

TOAST 

In ordinary wheat bread, starch is the principal constituent. 
Starch when subjected to a high degree of heat is changed 
into an easily digested substance called dextrin. 

In the ordinary cooking of a loaf of bread the starch, in 
the outer layer is changed into dextrin, which gives the crust 
its sweet flavor. Slices of bread toasted undergo a similar 
change. 

Bread is toasted not merely to brown it, but to take out 
all the moisture possible, so that it may be more thoroughly 
moistened with the saliva, and thus easily digested; also 
to give it a better flavor. The correct way to make toast is 
to use stale bread cut in uniform slices, and to dry it thor- 
oughly before browning. 

Toast prepared in this way, even if moistened with milk 
or water, may be easily and thoroughly acted upon by the 
digestive fluids.

VEGETABLES — VEGETABLE SAUCES 

LEGUMES — ROOTS AND TUBERS — GREEN VEGETABLES 

Vegetables include nearly all kinds of plant food except 
fruits, grains and nuts. 

Classification. Vegetables are classified as — 

Legumes — as peas, beans and lentils. 

Roots and Tubers — as potatoes, beets, turnips, etc. 

Green Vegetables — stems and leaves — as lettuce, spinach, 
celery, etc. 

Composition. All vegetables have a high percentage of 
water, and with the exception of legumes, a relatively small 
proportion of protein. The chief nutrients are starch and 
sugar. The fats are usually small in amount and chiefly in 
the form of oils. A variety of mineral salts are present, 
chiefly salts of potassium and sodium united with organic 
acids. Vegetables give bulk to food and possess antiscorbutic 
properties. 

Digestibility. As the gastric ferments play no part in 
carbohydrate digestion, vegetables are digested mainly in the 
intestines. The presence of cellulose prevents the ready di- 
gestion of the ni'trients, hence it may be stated as a general 
rule that vegetable food is less completely digested and ab- 
sorbed than animal food. It would seem desirable to restrict 



262 



VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 



this type of food for persons of very weak digestive powers. 

General Rules for Cooking Vegetables. Wash thoroughly ; 
pare, peel, or scrape, according to the- kind. Let them stand 
in cold water until ready to cook, to keep them crisp, to 
freshen them when wilted, or to prevent them from turning 
dark. 

Cook in enough freshly boiling salted water to cover, and 
keep the water boiling (not rapid boiling, as tender vegetables 
are easily broken). Allow one teaspoon of salt to one quart 
of water. Salt may be added when vegetables are put in, 
except in the case of delicate green vegetables, as peas, 
spinach, etc., when it should not be added until nearly done. 
To preserve the color, cook green vegetables uncovered. 

Vegetables should be cooked only until tender, drained im- 
mediately, and served promptly. Overcooking injures their 
flavor and makes them tough. Time for cooking vegetables 
varies with the size, age and freshness. 

Time-Tahle for Cooking Vegetables in Water 

Potatoes 25-30m. 

Carrots 35-45m. 

Turnips 45m. 
Beets (young) 45m. 

Beets (old) 3-4 hrs.

Onions 45-60m. 

Thrice-cooked Vegetables.^ The vegetables are cleaned, 
cut up fine, soaked in cold water and then strained. They 
are then tied up loosely in a large square of double cheese- 
cloth — large enough so that the corners of the cloth, after 
it has been tied up with a string, make conveniently long 
ends, and also large enough to allow the vegetables to swell 
without sticking together. They are tlien transferred to fresh 
cold water, placed on the fire, and allowed to reach 150° F. 
This water is poured off and replaced by water of the same 
temperature, which is brought to the boiling point, and then

the water is again poured off, and so on until the requisite 
number of changes are made. The pots for the vegetables 
should be of sufficient size to hold a large quantity of water, 
and in a hospital, vegetables enough for the daily supply of 
six patients. Vegetables thus cooked will keep in cold stor- 
age two or more days, and can be reheated in a steamer. 

If the vegetables are cooked with the cover left off the pot 
thev will be lighter in color and the flavor not so strong. 

ie^mes. Of this class of food-stuffs, peas and beans are 
the most important. Lentils and peanuts are also valuable. 

Composition. Fresh legumes, such as peas and beans, con- 
tain from 2 per cent, to 9 per cent, of protein, a trace of fat 
and from 7 per cent, to 30 per cent, of carbohydrate. 

Dried legumes, such as dried peas and beans, on account 
of the lessened amount of water, contain from 18 per cent, to 
3.5 per cent, of protein, over 1 per cent. fat. and as high as 
65 per cent, carbohydrate. They form one of the chief sources 
of protein in a strictly vegetarian diet. Digestibility depends 
larselv upon the method of cooking and the amount eaten. 

Roots and Tubers. Eoots and tubers contain the reserve 
material stored up by the plant, and some of them are among 
the important food-stuffs. Their nutritive value is largely 
due to starch and sugar. On account of the small proportion 
of protein and fat, and the large proportion of water, they 
are inferior in nutritive value to both legumes and cereals. 
The mineral matter is an important constituent of these, as 
of other vegetable foods. Sodium, potassium and iron salts, 
and sulphur and phosphorus compounds, are the common ash 
constituents. In combination with organic acids, etc., they 
contribute much to the flavor of these foods. 

As a class they may be divided into the following groups : 

1. Starch-yielding vegetables, as potatoes and sweet pota- 
toes. 

2. Succulent roots, as beets, carrots, parsnips and onions. 

3. Condimental or flavoring roots, as horse-radish and gin- 
ger. 



264 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

The potato is the most important of the starch-yielding 
class of vegetables. It is a tuber or thickened underground 
stem. 

The composition of the potato (Letheby) is as follows : 

Water 75.00 per cent. 

Starch 18.80 per cent. 

Nitrogenous matter 2.00 per cent. 

Sugar 3.00 per cent. 

Fat 20 per cent. 

When pared before cooking, there may be a considerable 
loss of nutritive material, especially of mineral matter. By 
cooking in the skin, this loss is largely prevented. To be 
easily digestible, a potato must be mealy, so as to be readily 
acted on by digestive juices. This is best accomplished by 
baking in an oven at 380 to 400° F. When a patient begins 
to take solids, the vegetable usually first prescribed is a baked 
potato. 

Beets, carrots, parsnips, salsify, turnips and onions are 
the most common of the class of succulent roots. They con- 
tain, as a rule, more water than the starch-yielding class of 
vegetables, and their carbohydrates are frequently in the form 
of sugars, pectins, and other polysaccharide carbohydrates 
some of which have no nutritive value. The percentage of 
crude fiber is greater than in the starch-yielding class. 

The characteristic flavors and odors are in many cases due 
to tlie presence of volatile organic compounds of sulphur. 
These are often advantageous in making the vegetables pal- 
atable, and adding variety to the diet. 

The beet contains a large percentage of starch and sugar. 

Carrots and parsnips also contain much sugar, and when 
young and tender form a very nutritious food. 

Onions contain considerable nutriment, but are most val- 
uable for their pungent oil, which is rich in sulphur. They 
have diuretic properties, and are useful in constipation. 

Eadishes contain a large amount of cellulose and should 
not be eaten by invalids. They are chiefly used as a relish. 



VEGETABLES 265 

Green Vegetables. These vegetables have a fuel value of 
less than 200 calories per pound; they are useful chiefly for 
their mineral salts, and for the bulk, variety and relish they 
give to the diet. 

Asparagus is easily digested, even by invalids. It has a 
diuretic action, and imparts a characteristic odor to the urine 

for some hours. 

Cabbage contains considerable sulphur and therefore fre- 
quently causes flatulence. 

Cauliflower belongs to the cabbage family, but is easily 

digested. 

Celery is more digestible cooked than raw. 

Spinach is especially valuable for its large amount of iron.

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 

The salad plants, such as lettuce, celery, water cress, en- 
dives, etc., contain little nutriment, but are especially rich 
in mineral matter, and served uncooked in the form of salad, 
all this mineral matter preserved. They are very valuable, 
as these mineral substances are necessary for the healthy 
condition of the blood and should form a large part of the 
daily diet. 

Salads should not be eaten by dyspeptics or those having 
delicate bowels. 

Salads should be prepared daintily, arranged attractively 
and always be served cold. Lettuce and other salad plants 
should be fresh, crisp, and dry. Wash thoroughly, on account 
of danger of germs from dust, soil, etc., chill in very cold 
water until crisp and dry by placing on a clean towel so that 
the water will drain from the leaves; or fold lightly in a 
towel and place on ice until serving time. Parsley is re- 
vived quickly by sprinkling with cold water and putting it 
into an air-tight fruit jar and keeping it in a cold place. 
Treated in this way it will keep fresh a long time. 

Dressing should not be added to green vegetables until 
just before serving, as it tends to wilt them. 

Meat to be used in salads should be free from skin and 
gristle, and should be cut into small cubes, mixed with French 
dressing and allowed to stand some time before combining 
with the vegetables.

FRUITS 1 

Fruits are the seed-bearing portions of plants. Some 
products of this class, such as melons, are sometimes called 
fruits and sometimes vegetables ; and a few vegetable products 
which are not fruits in the strict sense, are included in this 
class of food products because they have a similar place in 
the diet. 

Composition. Fresh fruits contain a high percentage of 
water, varying from about 75 per cent, to over 95 per cent. 
It has been suggested that those containing 80 per cent, or 
more of water be classed as flavor fruits, and those with less 
than 80 per cent, as food fruits : Bananas, grapes and fresh 
figs are "the commonest examples of the latter /^ass. When 
the water is removed by evaporation, as in drj^flag, the per- 
centage of moisture falls to 30 per cent, or less, and the 
proportion of nutrients is correspondingly raised, so that 
dried fruits would fall into the class of food fruits. Pre- 
served fruits have their nutritive value raised by the addition 
of water, and usually by some loss of water in preparation. 

1 For further information, note " Uses of Fruit as Food." Farmer's BuUe- 
tin No. 293. U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Washington. D. C. 



FRUITS 277 

As a class, fruits contain little or no fat. The olive is a 
remarkable exception. 

The proportion of protein is so low as to be practically negli- 
gible. 

Carbohydrates are the chief nutrient present. In ripe 
fruits these are almost wholly in the form of sugars and other 
soluble carbohydrates, commonly called pectin bodies. In 
unripe fruits starch is often found — notably in the ordinary 
banana. The principal sugars are sucrose or cane sugar, dex- 
trose or grape sugar, and levulose or fruit sugar. A mix- 
ture of the last two is common, and is called invert sugar. 

Fruits contain characteristic organic acids, such as malic 
in apples, citric in lemons, etc. These acids exist in the form 
of salts, usually of potassium. A little phosphoric acid, lime^ 
iron, etc., also occur. 

The flavor is due partly to the sugars and acids, and partly 
to characteristic ethereal bodies present in small quantities. 
Chemists have isolated the ethers and oils which give the 
peculiar flavor to bananas, strawberries and other fruits. 

Digestibility. Digestibility of fruits varies with the kind 
of fruit eaten and its mode of preparation ; stewed fruits are, 
in general, more easily digested than raw fruits. Personal 
idios}Ticrasy has also much to do with digestibility in case of 
this class of food materials. Oranges, lemons, grapes and 
peaches are very generally digested with ease. Oranges are 
much used in invalid dietaries, their juice being very effective 
in allaying thirst. Orange juice is also commonly adminis- 
tered to infants, especially if fed artificially, for the sake of 
the mineral matter and to prevent constipation and, in the case 
of infants fed on pasteurized or boiled milk or on proprietary 
foods, as an antiscorbutic. 

It is important to those who are obliged to exclude sugar 
from the dietary to know that fruits containing the least 
sugar are the plum, peach, apricot and raspberry. Those 
containing the largest amounts are the apple, sweet cherry,, 
grape and pear. 

The apple exerts a most excellent influence upon the liver 



278 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

and the kidneys, and is valuable in cases of acidity of the stom- 
ach. 

The juice of the ripe pineapple contains an enzyme, similar 
to pepsin, called bromelin, and so powerful is its action on 
protein that it will digest as much as one thousand times its 
weight within a few hours. It is especially valuable in diph- 
theria and diabetes. 

Dates, figs and prunes are valuable for inactivity of the 
liver and most excellent laxatives. Dates owing to their 
high food value and sweetness offer sugar in a most harm- 
less form to the child and are as satisfactory to them as candy. 

The banana contains a large amount of starch, as much as 
the potato ; therefore it should not be eaten in an unripe state. 
For invalids and children and others of delicate digestion, it 
should always be cooked. 

Grape juice and other freshly expressed juices are refresh- 
ing and wholesome beverages, and can often be given to in- 
valids when the pulp would prove irritating. 

Nutritive Value. Fresh fruits are chiefly valuable for 
their refreshing appetizing qualities, their ash constituents 
and the laxative effect of their cellulose content. The organic 
acids form carbonates in the body, and by their alkalinity as- 
sist in the regulation of body processes. Fresh and canned 
fruits are also valuable for their antiscorbutic property.^ 

In disturbed conditions of metabolism it is often important 
to know just what salts and acids fruits contain. 

As already stated, the chief nutrients are carbohydrates. 
In fuel value, fresh fruits resemble given vegetables, as is 
shown by the following figures :

FRUITS 279 

The dried fruits compare favorably with bread, dried beans 
and similar foods as to energy value, but the latter contain 
protein in considerable amounts, while in fruits it occurs only 
in small quantities. The fuel value of fruits is often in- 
creased by the sugar added in cooking or serving. 

Fruits are also valuable for bulk, which is an essential 
factor in diet. Most of them contain a considerable propor- 
tion of indigestible matter. Intelligently used, fruits are a 
valuable part of a well-balanced diet, and their use should 
be encouraged. 

Precautions in the Use of Fruit. Over-ripe or unripe fruit 
should not be eaten raw; besides inferior flavor there is dan- 
ger of digestive disturbance. 

Before serving, all fruit should be thoroughly washed to 
avoid germs. Digestive disturbances are more often caused 
by these germs than by the fruit itself. There is danger 
also of acquiring harmful intestinal parasites from raw 
fruits ; in all doubtful cases, the food should be cooked. 

For the Diabetic. Sugar must be replaced by sweetma or 
saccharin. It is many times sweeter than sugar but it has 
no food value. Xote Sugar Substitutes, page 249. 

BAKED APPLES 
AYipe and core apples. Put in a shallow dish with one 
tablespoon water to each apple; more may be added during 
cooking if necessary, put into the center of each apple two 
teaspoons sugar. Bake in a hot oven twenty to thirty min- 
utes, or until soft; baste with the syrup every ten minutes. 
A little nutmeg may be added to the sugar, and a few dro])s 
of lemon juice to each apple. Care must be taken that apples 
do not lose their shape and break. 1 apple = TO cal.

APRICOT AND PRUNE SAUCE, 178 CALORIES i 
14 cup prunes. 1 cup cold water. 

1/4 cup dried apricots. Sugar to taste. 

Wash fruit carefully; soak over night and cook slowly for 
two hours. If cooked properly the fruit will need very little 
sugar, as the sugar in the fruit is developed by this method 
of cooking. 

BAKED BANANA 
1 medium banana ^ 64 Calories. 

Eaw, this fruit is often indigestible, but baked it acts as 
a stimulant to the nerves, being at once received and rapidly 
assimilated by the stomach. Cut bananas in halves; put in 
shallow pan ; sprinkle with sugar and a little lemon juice and 
bake until soft. 

Note. — The banana contains starch and should be thor- 
oughly ripened before eating. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE OR JELLY 
1 cup cranberries. V2 cup water. 

1/3 cup sugar. 

Pick over and wash cranberries. Put in saucepan and add

lent for hoarseness and pressure on the lungs. 

ORANGE SUNFLOWER 

"Wash the orange. Put a three-tined fork into the stem 
end. Cut off each end down to pulp, leaving the stem end 
on fork, then pare off rind to pulp, cut out each section and 
place on small plate in sunflower fashion, the pieces of pulp 
for petals; fill centre with granulated sugar. Serve cold. 

Xote. — To cut nicely have a large, firm, cold orange and 
a sharp knife. 

ORANGE NO. II 
1 medium orange = 77 Calories. 

Select a large, firm orange; wash, cut and peel skin down 
in eight parts, leaving them connected to stem end of orange 
to form the petals, folding them under the pulp. Separate 
pulp in sections and put ice between petals before serving. 

DATE SAUCE 

Prepare apples as for stewing and partially cook. Add 
equal quantity of stoned Dromedary Dates, and sugar to 
taste. Cook until dates are tender. Serve either hot or cold. 

DATES FOR YOUNG CHILDREN 

Wash the dates and lay in water for fifteen minutes, then 
remove and dry ; take off the outer skin and remove the stone ; 
put through meat chopper ; add two teaspoons of orange juice 
to each cup of dates. This is good on toast or crackers and is 
very nourishing. It can be prepared and kept on hand sum- 
mer and winter. 

STEWED PRUNES 

3 prunes = 72 Calories. 

Wash and look over the prunes, cover with clear cold water 

and allow to stand on the back of range over night. In the 

morning put the saucepan where they will cook slowly for 

four hours. 



2B2 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

Xote. — No sugar is needed as prunes are 18 per cent, sugar, 
and by this manner of cooking are made very sweet. This 
simmering process renders them rich and juicy, while boiling 
toughens the skin. A little lemon juice is a pleasant addi- 
tion. 

Prunes are a valuable nutrient, and their use as a laxative 
is scarcely second to figs. 

STEAMED RHUBARB, 234 CALORIES i 
1 cup rhubarb (4 oz.). 14 to y^ cup sugar. 

Wash the rhubarb and cut it into inch pieces without re- 
moving the skin, as this gives a pretty pink color to the juice. 
Put it into an agate double boiler without water and steam 
one-half hour, or until soft. Do not stir, as it breaks the 
pieces. Sweeteii to taste at once on taking from fire. If 
rhubarb cooks a minute too long — which means after it has 
gone to pieces — it will lose its delicious flavor. 

STEWED FIGS, 936 CALORIES

yVTS 283 

NUTSi 

Nuts enter but little into the invalid's dietary, but as more 
attention is being paid to means of rendering them di- 
gestible, a word concerning them is not out of place. 

Composition. The edible substance of nuts is concentrated 
food, containing little water, and with few exceptions, much 
fat. ' In general, nuts are also rich in protein. The average 
composition is as follows: 

Water 1" t^'' 

Protein 6-lo% 

Fats 40-50% 

Carbohydrates 6-10% 

The only common nut containing much carbohydrate is the 
chestnut, which contains T3 per cent. The pignolia, peanut, 
butternut, almond, beechnut and pistachio contain over 20 
per cent, of protein. The pecan, brazil nut, butternut, filbert, 
hickory nut and walnut contain over 60 per cent, of fat. 

The ash content is comparatively high. Walnuts, almonds, 
etc., are rich in phosphoric acid. 

Cooking of Nuts. Xuts are more often eaten raw than 
cooked. But the peanut is not considered palatable when raw, 
and the chestnut is very indigestible unless the starch is 
cooked, when it becomes very easily digestible. Almonds are 
widely used in confectionery. 

Nuts may be used as staple articles of diet, in salad, soups, 
desserts, etc. 

To insure the best utilization of nuts they must be thor- 
oughly prepared for digestion by grinding or mastication. 
Nut butters offer much less resistance to digestion than raw 
nuts hastily eaten. On account of the high fat content, 
these products must be fresh, or the fat is likely to decompose 
(become rancid) and be irritating. 

Xut flours and meals are made into bread or porridge. 
Almond meal (containing no starch and very little sugar) 
is often utilized as a bread for diabetics. The chestnut can- 

iFor further information, note " Nuts and Their Uses as Food," Farmer's 
Bulletin No. 332, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. 



284 VEGETABLE OR PLANT FOODS 

not be so used, on account of its high content of starch. The 
peanut contains about 11 per cent, of carbohydrates, and 
hence is undesirable for this purpose. 

Digestibility. Nuts have been considered very indigestible. 
This is due largely to improper mastication or other prepara- 
tion for digestion; to the fact that they are a very concen- 
trated food, and are often eaten when not needed. While 
nut protein, as nuts are ordinarily eaten, is not so easily nor 
completely digested as meat protein, there are experiments 
showing that on the whole, they are as thoroughly digested 
as an ordinary mixed diet. No experiments have been re- 
ported on the ease or rapidity of nut digestion. 

Nutritive Value. Nuts are a concentrated food. This is 
clearly shown by the following figures: 



1 Ih. of Almonds, E. P.i . . 
1 lb. of Brazil nuts, E. P. . 
1 lb. of Filberts, E. P. ...

.yield 3238 Calories, 

.yield 2487 Calories, 

.yield 3199 Calories. 



The high fuel value is due to the absence of water and the 
large amount of fat present. Nuts can be most advan- 
tageously used along with bulky foods, such as fruits and 
vegetables, and those lacking in fat, such as bread. In a 
vegetarian diet they become a valuable source of protein. 

FUNGI AND ALG.a: 

These substances have little nutritive value. They may be 
considered as food adjuncts, rather than foods proper. 

Of fungi, mushrooms are the most commonly eaten. They 
are prized for their delicate flavor. Chemical analysis shows 
a high percentage of nitrogen, but although reported as pro- 
tein, it is largely in an indigestible form. 

Algae and lichens are much used as food in some parts of 
the world and high claims are sometimes made for their 
nutritive value, but digestion experiments show that, although 

1 Edible portion. 



FUNGI AND ALG^ 285 

they have a similar carbohydrate content to other succulent 
vegetable foods, these carbohydrates are not attacked by the 
ordinary digestive enzmes of the alimentary tract. 

The most important alga, from the dietetic standpoint, is 
Irish moss. It is commonly used in making jellies or sooth- 
ing beverages for invalids, but it has no nutritive value 
whatsoever. 

The lichen most used as food is Iceland moss, it has 
frequently been recommended as a food for diabetics, but it 
is practically indigestible.

Properly prepared, the dessert may constitute a very large 
part of the nutriment represented in a meal. Dishes con- 
taining eggs, milk, cream, starches, etc., in large proportion 
are necessarily of high nutritive value, and become a useful 
means of administering these foods to patients who do not 
care for the flavor of plain milk, raw eggs, cereals, etc., or 
who are likely to become tired of them. For invalids, com- 
binations of foods should always be simple, because the' more 
complex the mixture of protein, fat and carbohvdrate, the 
longer and more complicated is the process oi digestion. 
Hence junket, which is simply flavored, coagulated milk is 
one of the most digestible of desserts. As a rule, less sugar 
is relished in sickness than in health; an excess is apt to 
cause nausea. 

Dainty service is most important. Baked custards and 
junkets are usually best served in the original individual 
molds to avoid danger of breaking, or in case of junket of 
becoming watery. Sauces should never be poured over pud- 
dings till the moment of serving. Care must be taken to 
see that cold desserts are thoroughlv chilled; a lukewarm 
custard IS frequently nauseating and always unappetizing. 

For the Duihetic. Sugar must be replaced by sweetina or 
saccharin. J t is many times sweeter than sugar but it has no 
food value. Note Sugar Substitutes, page 249.

JUNKET 

Junket is a healthful and dainty dessert made simply of 
pure milk, and containing enough of the active principle 
of rennet found in the Junket Tablet to coagulate the milk. 
It is nutritious and has the added advantage of being easily 
digested. 

Milk or cream that has been boiled, sterilized, condensed 
or evaporated cannot be used in making junket, and care 
must be taken not to heat the milk more than lukewarm, as 
hot milk spoils the action of the tablet. 

For diabetic patients saccharin may be used as a substitute 
for sugar in these recipes.

FROZEN DESSERT 

ICE CREAM — SHERBET — ICES 

Frozen dishes not only constitute an acceptable form of 
serving nutriment, but often are a means of furnishing addi- 
tional liquid and relieving thirst. Ices and sherbets made 
with fruits and water, have a dietetic value similar to acid 
beverages. Frozen cream, milk, junkets, custards, etc., have 
the same nutritive value as the same foods served without 
freezing. 

In giving all very cold dishes, care must be taken not to 
interfere with the digestion of other foods. Chilling the 
mouth hinders the formation and activity of saliva; chilling 
the stomach retards gastric digestion. The latter effect can 
be avoided by eating ice-cold food very slowly, so that it is 
partially warmed before reaching the stomach. Frozen foods 
should not be given when ptyalin digestion is especiallv im- 
portant. 



ICE CREAM 307 

General Rules for Freezing. Ice (or snow) and salt are 
required for the process of freezing. The salt melts the ice, 
and in melting absorbs heat from the mixture, thus causing it 
to freeze. The finer the ice, the more quickly the freezing 
\vill be accomplished. In packing a freezer allow three level 
measures of ice to one of salt. This proportion is found best 
for fine-grained mixture. The can should not be filled more 
than three-fourths full, as the liquid expands in freezing, and 
if over-crowded, the cream will become coarse-grained and the 
cover may be pushed up allowing the salt water to get in. 

Freezing in Small Amounts. Put mixture to be frozen 
into a water-tight baking powder can, or a small tin pail with 
cover, and stand in large pail or bowl. Pack the ice and salt 
alternately under and around it (ice pounded fine), using 
one part salt to three parts ice. Remove cover, and beat 
mixture with Dover egg-beater until foamy, replace cover and 
turn can, or pail, back and forth; remove cover occasionally 
and scrape the frozen mixture from side of can, and beat 
thoroughly with fork. The mixture will freeze in twenty 
minutes. When frozen, place a narrow strip of cloth, dipped 
in melted beef fat or lard, around the outside of cover to keep 
out the salt water. Repack in ice, or ice and salt, and cover 
well until wanted. 

Serve frozen dishes in sherbet, champagne, or high glasses ; 
pass on small plate covered with doily, and at the side of the 
plate a small cake, wafer or a few orange straws may be 
added ; a rose will add to the attractiveness. 

For the Diabetic. Sugar must be replaced by sweetina or 
saccharin. It is many times sweeter than sugar but it has no 
food value. Xote Sugar Substitutes, page 249.

CHAPTER XII 

CAKE 

The two methods of making cake light are by means of 
air and of gas. Air is introduced by beating, or by the 
addition of beaten eggs, as in sponge cake. ^^ hen the light- 
ness is entirely dependent upon air, the whites and yolks of 
e<r<Ts should be beaten separately. 

^Gas mav be generated from within by combining an acid 
and alkali and adding moisture; as cream of tartar and 
bicarbonate of soda; or sour milk and soda; or molasses and 
baking powder. The combination of both air and gas is 
used to raise butter cakes. 

General Directions for Calce Making. Before blending the 
cake, see that the oven is at right temperature for baking 
and the pans greased with a little beef fat and dredged with 
flour The pan mav be lined with paper to prevent cake 
burning on bottom when cake requires long baking or when 
the oven bakes too quickly on the bottom. Have all material 
at hand and measured. Tse a round bottom bowl, and a 
wooden spoon for mixing; beat rather than stir the mixture 
and fold in ingredients. Put mixture in cake pans, slightly 
higher on the sides than in the center, as cake rises more 
quickly in the center. Layer cake takes a hotter oven than 
loaf cake. If cake is baked properly, it will rise, but not 
brown, during first quarter of the time required for bakmg ; 
become slightlv browned the second quarter; well browned 
during the third; and shrink from the pan during the 

fourth. .1 i. u 

If the oven is too hot, a crust will form over the top be- 
fore the cake has risen sufficiently and the cake will break 

317 



318 CAKE 

open on the top. If the oven is too cool the cake will rise too 
much and will be of coarse texture. 

Place pans in oven in such position that they may remain 
and do not move them before the third quarter of the baking. 
If the top of the cake should brown too quicklv cover witli 
a piece of light weight paper, slightly buttered on the one 
side and next to the cake. 

Cake is sufficiently baked when it shrinks slightly from 
the edge of the pan and feels tirm to the touch; if when 
tested with a fine washed and heated knitting or darning 
needle and it comes out clear. In looking at cake do not 
open the oven door too wide and only for a moment, and 
care must be taken not to jar the door in closing.

GENEBAI TYPES OF DIET USED IN HOSPITALS 

LIQiriD OR FLUID DIETS 

Foods to he Used. Acid, starchy and miscellaneous bev- 
erages (note various chapters for recipes). Eaw eggs in com- 
bination with water, milk, fruit juices, cocoa, or other fluids 
(note chapter Albuminous Beverages). Milk either plain or 
modified in different ways as given in recipes under chapter ; 
thus milk may be flavored with cocoa, chocolate, coffee or meat 
broth; diluted with lime water, or carbonated water; com- 
bined with starchy drinks or strained gruels. Broths of vari- 
ous kinds; beef juice; beef tea; beef extiact. Soups, both 
clear and creamy. 

LOW FLUID DIET, 100-200 CALORIES 

This consists practically of plain broths, clear soups, thin 
gruels, dilute fruit juices slightly sweetened, along with non- 
nutritious drinks, such as plain tea and coffee. These food 
articles are in reality not given for their very slight nutritive 
value, but because they are palatable and at the same time 
enable the stomach to rest for a day or two. Thus the patient 
receives a liberal daily supply of water (two or three pints) 
in a bland and agreeable form.

2 quarts of plain water, or White Rock, or Vichy, 
should be consumed, in addition, in every 24

MEDIUM FLUID DIET (HALF RATION), 800-900 CALORIES 

This is intended for very brief use — a few days at most, to 
rest the digestive organs and prepare the patient for the full 
fluid regimen. The balance of the daily requirement must 
be borrowed from the patient's own tissues. This diet may 
be obtained from the following articles : 

Milk 114 pints (about) 400 calories 

Meat Broth ly^ pints (about) 110 

Cereal Flour for Gruel . . 1 tablespoon ( about ) 40 " 

Sugar 4 tablespoons 240 " 

Egg White 2 27 " 

Lemon Juice 4 tablespoons 22 " 

Coffee, tea, vichy, water (no fuel value)

In arranging these food articles in a daily menu, individual 
feedings should be small and succeed one another every two 
hours (eight or nine feedings daily).

HIGH CALORY FLUID DIET 

When as a consequence of influenza or any severe mental 
strain there is a continuous loss of appetite, with complete 
repugnance to solid food, an individual may secure sufficient 
daily calories for leading a fairly active life through fluid 
diet in the form of egg nogs. One of the latter composed 
of 8 oz. of milk or thin cream with the addition of two eggs 
and one tablespoonful of sugar will yield from 350 to 600 cal- 
ories, and one made of a mixture of equal parts of whole milk 
and thin cream will yield nearly 500 calories. If intended 
for brief use only, a few days at most, the occasional addi- 
tion of an ounce of spirits will not only add nearly 100 extra 
calories, but will perhaps cause a slight desire for other foods, 
such as dipped toast. From 4 to 6 of these egg nogs daily, 
according to the food value will secure at least 2000 calories. 

The high calory diet used in Typhoid Fever may be adapted 
j^ to other conditions (note Chapter XIV). ^

REGULAR HOUSE DIET 

New York Hospital i 

The regular house diet in institutions comprises a great 
variety of dishes, so that it is always possible to consult econ- 
omy in making a selection. It consists of a general plan of 
feeding, in which general terms like soup, meat, cereal, fruit, 
puddings are set down, together with beverages and bread and 
butter. The special diet gives the particular cereal, soup, 
etc., for each day and meal. There is, however, no absolute 
distinction between the two diets, for as will be noted, the gen- 
eral plan contains certain special dishes which do not appear 
in the special diets.

CHAPTER XIV 
DIET IN DISEASE 

One of the most striking differences between the older and 
more recent methods of treatment of disease is the careful 
attention bestowed upon the diet at the present day. For it is 
now recognized that the proper selection of food, both solid 
and fluid, is of as much importance as the use of medicaments. 
In the management of diseases affecting the digestive organs 
proper, and in all affections of metabolism (gout, obesity and 
diabetes, for example) the diet may be said to represent the 
treatment, and there is hardly any disease which may not be 
benefited by intelligent feeding. 

These matters, however, are left entirely to the medical prac- 
titioner, and it is only exceptionally that the nurse is required 
to assume any responsibility. She should know in a general 
wav, however, the types of food suitable in different diseased 
conditions, so that she may avoid harmful foods when not 
given specific instructions, and so that she may adapt the 
prescribed diet to the tastes of the individual. For this pur- 
pose, an outline of the diets in use in common diseases is 
included in this volume. 

DIET IN FEVERS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES 

DIET IN FEVER IN GENERAL 

In fevers due to poisons circulating in the blood, there is 
an interference with heat regulation, so that the heat gen- 
erated in the body cannot be gotten rid of in the normal 
way; an increased metabolism; and a disturbance of the di- 
gestive functions, especially in the early stages. It is, there- 
fore, desirable to give easily digested food, in small quantities 

334 



FEVERS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES 335 

at frequent intervals, preferably in liquid form, as substances 
dissolved in water are more readily absorbed, aod water tends 
to aid in cooling the body to normal temperature. 

For tlie first three or four days, patients previouslv strong 
should be given only fluid foods. But since a normal man, 
lying quietly in bed, requires about 2000 calories to com- 
pensate for daily loss of energ}-, and since in the increased 
metabolism of fever, this requirement is increased, it is neces- 
sary that more substantial food be incorporated into the diet 
as far as is possible without disturbing digestion. 

DIET. — Milk is the staple food, but must be given with care, 
swallowed verv slowly and diluted with limewater, soda, seltzer or 
other effervescent water — one part to two parts milk. 

If milk can be taken, two or three pints should be given — four 
ounces every two hours, or six ounces every three hours. In case 
milk does not agree, whey may be given as a substitute for milk in 
part or in whole. Modified milk or peptonized milk may be given. 
Sometimes the milk may be flavored with tea, coffee, cocoa or 
malted milk and junket used. 

Xext to milk the most important article of diet is beef juic-e and 
broths. Xext come well cooked gruels. Later well prepared cereals 
and malt extract are valuable, and plain or cocoa junkets. Usually 
there is thirst, and all acid drinks, such as grape juice, may be taken. 
Panopepton with crushed ice, peptonised milk, clam, mutton and 
chicken broth, beef tea, clear soups, thickened with some farinaceous 
substance, gelatin jellies, are all of value. 

Liquids.— Pure cold water, toast water, any of the acid drinks, 
all sipped slowly, are recommended both to relieve thirst and on 
account of facilitating the speed with which the waste matter re- 
sulting from increased metabolism of the fever is eliminated through 
the kidneys. 

AVOID. — Any solid or vegetable food or fruits, until permitted 
by the physician in charge.

sons, and taking meats or other solid foods too soon may cause 
rise in temperature, rapid heart action, and possibly visceral 
congestion. The first meat given, therefore, should be in a 
finely subdivided state, such as scraped beef or minced chicken. 

During convalescence from protracted fevers the more 
easily digested forms of starchy foods are found to be very 
useful, especially if there has been much loss of weight. Sago 
and tapioca, and dried bread crumbs rolled through a fine 
sieve may be added to thicken clear meat broths. Crackers 
and zwieback are useful. 

Other ingredients which may be added to thicken soups 
during convalescence are panada, semolina, tapioca, and maca- 
roni. Custard puddings, cooked fruit, wine and beef jellies, 
blanc-mange, or baked custard, may be allowed. "Mush," 
fine hominy, cornstarch, farina, and boiled rice, with beef 
juice, can be ordered. 

The following dietary will serve as a general guide for 
feeding convalescents from fevers of ordinary severity in 
which special lesions of the alimentary canal are not present.

DIET IN TYPHOID FEVEE 

The modem dietetics of typhoid fever has undergone a 
rather radical change in the light of the very significant work 
done by physicians ^ in the past few years. There is no longer 
any necessity for giving the starvation treatment. A fluid 
diet is advisable at first, and perhaps for some time during 
the febrile period. As soon as the individual patient is in a 
fit condition, however, soft diet yields the best results. 

As in the past, constant attention from the physician and 
nurse is a most important factor. A schedule musi be worked 
out for each patient, and then strictly adhered to by the nurse. 
All developments must be carefully watched, noted and cared 
for, chiefly by an alteration in the diet,

Med. Director, Bellevue Hospital: Dr. B. B. Crohn, Mt. Sinai Hospital, New 
York; Dr. Kelly, Dr. LaFetra, Dr. Shroeder and others. 



338 DIET IN DISEASE 

The first important clinical evidence of the value of a 
liberal diet, is that given by Dr. Shattuek.^ 

" When typhoid kills, it does so either by perforation or ex- 
haustion. The main factors in producing exhaustion, which 
causes the death of at least nine-tenths of the fatal cases, are 
toxemia, continued fever, diarrhea and vomiting, and in- 
testinal hemorrhage.'^ 

" Most of us are agreed that we are not as yet acquainted 
with any therapeutic measures which either abort or very 
materially shorten the course of the disease. We are, I think, 
unanimous in believing that husbanding the strength from 
the start through skillful nursing, the judicious use of water 
externally and internally, and the supervision of a wise at- 
tendant on the watch for and prepared to meet such indica- 
tions as may arise, materially modifies the course of the dis- 
ease and lessens its mortality. If what I have assumed to be 
facts be really facts, the question of diet must be a very im- 
portant one in the management of typhoid fever. It is 
tlirough the food which is assimilated, not through that which 
is merely put into the stomach, that we seek to limit the tissue 
waste while the process is active, and also try to land the pa- 
tient on the low shore of convalescence with as much of his 
property as may be ; for the recovery of his property is a nec- 
essary preliminary to the attainment of the high tableland of 
full health." 

" I may perhaps add here that diarrhea is not nearly as 
constant a symptom in typhoid fever as the books lead stu- 
dents to believe. In at least 50 per cent, of my hospital 
cases no diarrhea was present at any time. We must there- 
fore have reference to the local intestinal lesions as well as 
to the general state. In a disease of such long course it is 
impossible to prevent accidents by putting the bowels in splints, 
even if it were desirable to do so. More or less peristalsis

Fever," read Ky title in the Section of Practice of Medicine at the 48th Annual 
Meeting of the American Medical Association at Philadelphia, Pa., June, 1897.

must go on, and waste matter must pass over the ulcerated 
surfaces ; and how deep or extensive the ulcerated surface may 
be in any particular case no S}Tnptom or group of symptoms 
enables us to measure. Hence, it seems rational, quite apart 
from the fever, to withhold from the diet any articles the 
residue of which is liable to irritate either the mucous mem- 
brane in general or the ulcerated portion in particular. This 
would seem a fair explanation for the popularity of milk as 
a diet for typhoid, containing as it does a large proportion 
of water, and every principle necessary to nutrition, so com- 
bined as to make relatively small demands on the digestion of 
most persons, and leaving a residue which, though notoriously 
large, is not mechanically irritating. The objection to milk 
is that it is repugnant to a few persons, and becomes either 
repugnant or monotonous to a considerable number sooner or 
later. It is not necessary here to specify the many expedi- 
ents which may and often must be resorted to to overcome 
this objection, and in some cases to render it digestible 
whether palatable or not. Milk is likely to maintain a very 
important, perhaps leading place in the diet of typhoid, as 
well as of other diseases and conditions." 

"During the twelve years, 1886 to 1897 (both inclusive), 
380 cases of typhoid fever have come under my personal care 
in the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1886 to 1893, 
233 cases were treated under a milk diet, with a mortality of 
10 per cent. From 1892 to 1897, 147 cases have Been treated 
under a much more extended diet with a mortality of 81 
per cent. I know well the liability to reach false conclusions 
in reasoning from too small figures in a disease like typhoid 
fever. And it is also true that water has been used more 
efficiently of late than in former years. But I can see noth- 
ing in my figures to contravene my observation that an en- 
larged diet has not been injurious. I would not be under- 
stood as advocating an indiscriminate diet. My plea is simply 
for treating the patient rather than the disease; for feeding 
him with reference to his digestive power rather than solely

340 DIET IN DISEASE 

or mainly with reference to his fever; for the view that the 
danger of accidents from the local intestinal ulceration is not 
increased by allowing him to partake of articles which leave 
no irritating residue, and which cautious trial shows are di- 
gested without disturbance or discomfort." 

Through observing some patients, to whom, because of great 
weakness, a full diet was given, Dr. Shattuck found that the 
increased diet, led to a happier and more rapid convalescence, 
and consequently, enlarged Ms dietetic treatment for all sub- 
sequent cases. 

It seems strange that this did not command wider attention, 
but a long habit is hard to overcome. Dr. Shattuck's views 
are now upheld by scientific as well as by clinical evidence. 
One of the most significant contributions to the science of 
feeding has been made by Dr. Coleman ^ and his associates, 
who have studied typhoid patients in a respiration calorim- 
eter ^ (large enough to allow for a patient in bed) and in 
other ways determined accurately the effect of food. A suf- 
ficient number of cases has been studied to give us convincing 
evidence of the beneficial results of high feeding. 

THE HIGH CALORY FEEDINGS 

Dr. Coleman estimated that the minimum daily requirement 
should be 40 calories per kilogram (2.2 pounds) of body 
weight — that is 3000 calories for a man of 70 kilograms 
(154 pounds). This diet did not prevent loss of body weight. 
To prevent loss, from 60 to 80 calories per kilogram are 
needed. The optimum amount must be determined for each 
patient. 

Those foods which are easy of digestion and of high nu- 
tritive value, are used. Carbohydrate foods contribute about 
half in point of calories. Sugar in the form of lactose (milk

sugar) is the best, as it is less inclined to ferment, and more 
can be taken because of its lack of sweetness. 

Protein has the same drawbacks in fever as in health, and 
should be limited to from 60 to 90 grams per day. Dr. Cole- 
man does not advocate the use of meat as a source of protein. 
Enough can be obtained elsewhere, and meat is more liable 
to putrefaction. 

Fat is of great value, especially after the first few days of 
the febrile period, and during convalescence. It has a ten- 
dency to cause nausea or diarrhea if given in excess. 

Each patient must be studied to find out his maximum. 
Fat should be given in an emulsified form, as cream, butter 
or egg-yolk. 

The patient should first be put on a low liquid diet (not 
lower than 1000 calories, however) until any undesirable con- 
dition may be corrected. Then as rapidly as possible the fluid 
diets higher in fuel value and then soft diet, are used, until 
the patient's maximum capacity is reached. In the cases 
studied and reported, the various doctors^ have experienced 
little difficulty from the patient himself. Some have taken 
food amounting to 6000 calories a day, without special 
urging. 

The advantages from this purely dietetic treatment of 
typhoid, seem to be many. The patients are contented, al- 
most free from delirium, and not more liable to relapse. Ab- 
dominal distension, and diarrhea, which were considered 
symptoms of the disease, have ceased. Body weight is either 
maintained or any loss is recovered before the patient leaves 
the hospital. The long slow convalescence has apparently 
disappeared. 

From this, at least some of the causes of death from ex- 
haustion, mentioned above, are eliminated.

desirable to add eggs to the diet in order toWse the nitrogen 
to the desired amount. The eggs may be soft-boiled or'' be 
. shaken up in any of the above feedings unless distasteful to 
the patient, though the addition of an egg makes the stronger 
mixtures very rich. I have given some patients who seemed 
unable to get enough to eat 4 ounces of milk, 4 ounces of 
cream, 2 ounces of milk sugar, and an egg at a feeding. Such 
patients, however, are exceptional. 

"Milk toast, with the addition of butter or cream, is rel- 
ished by many patients. 

"The following menus were arranged by Miss Mary E. 
Sheehan, head nurse in Ward AI of Bellevue Hospital, and 
have been employed, with such modifications as individual 
patients required, for the last two years. They may be fol- 
lowed in general at any stage of the disease if the patient is 
capable of taking solid and semi-solid food, and if he is hun- 
gry, but are most useful in the later stages, and in convales- 
cence. The night-feedings are given when the patients' tem- 
perature are taken in the course of the ward routine."

milk-sugar may be given in some other form.

Mary S. Rose, Ph.D.i 
Wlien the typhoid patient is not limited to a fluid diet, 
foods may be chosen from the following : 

1. Milk in various forms. 

2. Broths — beef, veal, chicken, mutton. 

3. Soups — potato, pea, bean, carefully strained and thick- 
ened with flour, milk, cream, and egg may be used. 

4. Gruels — always strained. 

5. Eggs, raw or soft-cooked. 

6. Cream and butter. 

7. Custards, ice cream and sherbets, blanc manges, and gel- 
atin jellies. Milk sugar used for sweetening will increase 
the fuel value. 

8. Toast. 

9. Breakfast cereals, thoroughly cooked and strained. 

10. Bice, baked and mashed potatoes.

is often so extreme that it is advisable to concentrate all food, 
to lessen the number of necessary acts of deglutition. Meat 
juice, petptonoids, beaten eggs and brandy, may be added to 
good milk. Plain vanilla ice cream may be given. Its cold- 
ness is sometimes soothing to the pharynx. 

Holding cracked ice in the mouth before swallowing will 
sometimes annul the pain momentarily, or in extreme cases

the pharynx and tonsils may be sprayed with cocaine, and the 
period of temporary ansethesia may be utilized for swallowing 
considerable nourishment. This is rarely necessary, for un- 
less the patient is emaciated by previous serious illness, he is 
not apt to be in need of much food for a day or two. In bad 
cases of suppurative tonsilitis the strength suffers more, and 
stimulants may be given by tbe rectum if deglutition is im- 
possible. 

After all forms of tonsilitis there is apt to be considerable 
anaemia, and the patient for a week or two should eat abun- 
dantly of animal food. Egg-nog and milk punches are often 
needed for the first few days of convalescence. 

DIET IK DIPHTHERIA 
Dr. Thompson i 

Dietetic Treatment. " Alimentation occupies the first 
place in the general treatment" (Trousseau.) Throughout 
the active stage of the disease, while the fever lasts, there is 
difficulty in swallowing. All food should be given in fluid 
form, of which milk is best; or if as sometimes happens, semi- 
solid material is more easily swallowed, the food may be 
thickened with cream, gelatine, eggs or farinaceous articles; 
or beef meal. Malted milk, Mellen's food, or granum, etc., may 
be added for this purpose to other foods. The diet should 
consist chiefly of nutritious beef or chicken broth and beef 
tea, egg albumin, egg nog, milk and milk punch. Plain 
vanilla ice cream is nutritious, and if not too sweet, it is well 
borne, and is frequently very acceptable to the inflamed throat. 
Simple farinaceous foods, such as arrowroot, thoroughly 
cooked rice, soft cream toast and gruels may be taken. Con- 
tinued disgust of food is a very bad prognostic sign and every 
effort should be made to counteract it by offering variety.

DIET IN PNEUMONIA 
Sr. Thompson i 

Dietetic Treatment. The indications for treatment are to 
give a light diet, which will not excite the cough in swallow- 
ing, or increase dyspnoea by distention of the stomach, or 
augment the enfeeblement of the heart action by overtaxing 
the digestive powers. Vomiting should be especially guarded 
• against, and if nausea exists, efforts should be made at once 
to control it. It is not necessary to keep the patient upon a 
rigid milk diet, but if milk is well borne, it is advisable to 
give nothing else while the acute symptoms last; otherwise, 
whey, meat juice, broths, and egg albumin may be allowed. 
Starchy and saccharine food must be withheld. Cold drinks 
are both acceptable and beneficial to the patient, and water 
plain or aerated, such as carbonated or soda water, mav be 
drunk in considerable quantity. It is believed by some au- 
thorities that the activity of the kidne3-s may be thus pro- 
moted, and that the poison which occasions the constitutional 
symptoms of the disease may be better eliminated. There are 
cases, however, among persons with robust circulation, in 
which the onset is very sudden and violent. The pulse is full 
and bounding, and the heart is greatly overworked by the ef- 
fort to propel a large volume of imperfectly aerated blood. 
In such instances the addition of large quantities of fluid to 
the circulation, besides what is actually required for nutrition, 
may have the effect of still further straining the heart. 

It is stated that carbonated waters reduce the viscidity of 
the sputum, which is often very tenacious. 

The diet should be kept fluid until defervescence has oc- 
curred, with a normal temperature and commencing disap- 
pearance of the exudation — in fact, it is well to prolong 
the fluid diet for three or four daA's after the temperature 
has become normal, in order to make sure that a relapse of 
the fever is not likely to follow. In those cases in which 
resolution is postponed, and the patient becomes more and

more feeble ,altliongh the temperature may be nearly or quite 
normal, it may be desirable to give a little properly prepared 
solid food somewhat earlier, and scraped beef, with toast, or 
a soft-cooked egg may be added to the milk diet. 

During the entire period of convalescence the diet must 
be very nourishing and of easy digestion; milk may still be 
given, and after slowly returning to the regulation three meals 
a day (see Diet in Convalescence from Typhoid Fever), very 
feeble patients do well to take milk punch, or egg-nog, or a 
glass of wine and a biscuit three or four times a day in the 
intervals. 

Alcohol. In alcoholic subjects who have been drinking up 
to the time of the onset of the disease it may be indispensable 
to continue the use of alcohol, for the sudden withdrawal of its 
stimulating eifect on the organism may give rise to rapid col- 
lapse. In aged and constitutionally weak persons it is also 
indicated, but the majority of patients if given abundant fresh 
air do better without it. 

The custom now in vogue of prescribing other forms of 
cardiac stimulants, such as strychnine and vasodilators, like 
nitroglycerin, makes the employment of excessive doses of 
alcohol less imperative. It should always be remembered that 
it is undesirable to produce toxic symptoms of alcoholism in 
pneumonia, as well as in any other disease. So long as the 
pulse is slowed and its force strengthened, the use of alcohol 
may be regarded as beneficial ; but if delirium is increased, 
and the odor of whiskey or brandy is strong in the breath an 
hour or two after it has been given, it is an indication that 
the patient is receiving more than is desirable, and the dosage 
should be reduced. 

DIET IN BRONCHO-PNEUMONIA 
Dr. Thompson i 
Dietetic Treatment. Broncho-pneumonia is always a very 
critical disease, and the utmost care is required in nursing 

1 W. Oilman Thompson, M.D. : " Practical Dietetics," 1909. D. Appleton

FEVERS AND IXFECTIOUS DISEASES 351 

and feeding. Stimulation may be required early in consider- 
able quantity. Hot milk and vichy in the proportion of one 
part of vichy to two of milk for older children or half and 
half for young infants may have the effect of loosening the 
mucus and easing the cough. If there is any tendency to 
flatulency, aerated waters had better be avoided. WTien tlie 
disease occurs in children the diet should be adapted to foster 
the strength and tax the digestive organs as little as possible. 
At first food should be given every two hours, and predigested 
milk is usually all that is required. Later it may be alter- 
nated with or supplemented by egg albumin, expressed meat 
juice, plain beef or mutton broths, arrowroot, or other gruels. 

DIET IN MITMPS 
Dr. Thompson i 

For mumps no special diet is required, beyond the neces- 
sity of giving fluids or soft food while the swelling of the 
parotid glands and fever last. The suggestions for the die- 
tetic treatment of tonsilitis apply to this disease. Anemia 
is apt to be extreme during convalescence, and meat should 
therefore be plentifully supplied. Cod-liver oil is very ap- 
propriate in protracted convalescence. 

DIET IN WHOOPING COUGH 
Dr. Thompson i 

In whooping cough the paroxysms of coughing are so 
severe as to give rise to vomiting, and in bad cases they are 
excited by taking food which does not have an opportunity 
to become assimilated, and nutrition may suffer verv seriously 
in consequence, adding to the general exhaustion Vhich ac- 
companies the disease. All food must be made easily as- 
similable. It is best to give food regularly in moderate quan- 
tity at each time, and it should be predigested if neces- 
sary. Pancreatinised milk, kumyss, the prepared amylaceous

foods, cream toast, eggs, junket, chicken broth, malted farina- 
ceous foods, custard, milk puddings, gruels thickened with 
meat extracts, and stimulants in the form of egg albumin in 
sherry, egg-nog or milk punch, are recommended for patients 
who vomit solid food. The worst cases require nutrient 
enemata, as exhaustion becomes critical. 

DIET IN TUBERCULOSIS 

Wliile the proper diet is the primary factor in the treatment 
in tuberculosis, the influence of good h3'gienic conditions must 
also be emphasized. Plenty of fresh air is an essential. 
Whenever it is possible to live out of doors this should be en- 
couraged. Suitable periods of rest, and when possible some 
light exercise should be prescribed. The main object in treat- 
ment is to build up in the body such strong defenses against 
the activity of the tubercle bacillus that its rapid growth is 
arrested, and its results minimized. 

The purpose of the dietetic treatment is to supply such 
foods as will conserve body tissue and help to restore what has 
been lost through disease. Feeding must be carefully con- 
trolled since an overabundance of food may result in injury to 
the organs of digestion and assimilation. For this reason the 
so called " stuffing method," or hyperalimentation, has been 
largely abandoned in the treatment of tuberculosis. A mod- 
erate amount of food well digested and assimilated is con- 
ducive to better result than overfeeding. Since individuals 
in normal health differ as to their energy requirements accord- 
ing to their weight, age and activity, so the diet in tuberculosis 
must be regulated to meet the individual need. A man at 
active work may require from 3000 to 4000 calories per day, 
but at complete rest, even though under treatment for tuber- 
culosis his energy requirement may be reduced to about 2500 
calories. On the other hand, the sedentary man of the same 
weight, who required perhaps 2500 calories in normal health 
might need 3000 calories if he should undertake some light 
exercise in the course of his treatment for tuberculosis. 

If a patient is underweight the fuel value of the diet ao 



FEVERS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES 353 

cordiug to Bardswell and Chapman should be increased 30 
per cent, over his normal requirement for his highest weight 
in health/ and this supply maintained until he gains a slight 
excess over his highest normal weight. At this point his 
diet may be reduced by 15 per cent, so long as it proves 
equal to the maintenance of the required weight. For ex- 
ample an active man with an energy requirement of 3000 
calories per day would need, if tuberculous, additional fuel 
to the extent of 900 calories until the proper weight was 
attained, and then a reduction of 450 calories could be made, 
leaving a daily total of 3450 calories. The increase in fuel 
value may be met by fats, carbohydrates or protein, though 
the capacity for digesting any kind of food must be taken 
into consideration. Fats such as cream, butter, olive oil, 
codliver oil and bacon are all valuable sources of fuel, but 
in some individuals they are not well digested nor assimilated 
in large quantities, so a substitution of some carbohydrate in 
the form of bread stuffs or vegetables may give better re- 
sults. 

Since there is a rapid waste of tissue in tuberculosis, the 
diet must contain a rather high per cent, of protein. In the 
normal diet from 10 to 15 per cent, of fuel in the form of pro- 
tein is considered liberal, but it is advisable in this disease to 
raise the protein calories about 30 per cent, and give from 15 to 
20 per cent, of the fuel value of the diet in the form of protein, 
in order to afford the best conditions for building up the tis- 
sues and repairing the waste. With a total energy require- 
ment of 3000 calories a liberal amount of protein is supplied 
by 80 to 120 grams per day. With a 30 per cent, increase 
this would be advanced to between 120 and 155 grams. Pro- 
tein in very large amounts is inadvisable as it may be ac- 
companied by putrefaction, gout or other nutritive disorders 
and so delay the process of repair. Milk and eggs are best 
adapted to this purpose, and they appear most often as the 
basis of a tuberculosis diet, but other forms of protein such 
as those in cereals and legumes may be substituted if they 
are found to be equally digestible. 

1 Note Energy Requirement of the Body, oaee 66. 



354 DIET IN DISEASE 

In planning a diet for tuberculosis there must be the same 
recognition of individual differences as in health. The age 
and sex of the patient, as well as the amount of exercise, must 
be taken into account. While the diet in general should be 
more or less concentrated, a patient who is doing moderate 
work, and is accustomed to considerable bulk can digest with 
ease what a patient of sedentary habits would find quite dif- 
ficult to dispose of. The cost of food is another factor in 
the diet for tuberculosis since tlie high protein diet demanded 
may prove too expensive especially if largely in the form of 
milk, eggs and meat. Proteins from plant sources, such as 
cereals, legumes, nuts and cheese, may be used in so far as 
they do not interfere with digestion. Oleomargarine, suet 
and beef drippings may replace the more expensive fats, such 
as butter and olive oil when necessary for economy. 

The appetite of the patient in tuberculosis is usually poor; 
hence the food, though simple in character, sliould be pre- 
pared with the utmost care, and served attractively. Three 
meals a day stimulate the appetite better than a larger num- 
ber. However, if the patient is in such a weak state as to 
be able to take only small quantities at a time, six small 
meals may be given at regular intervals. Sometimes three 
meals with a small amount of food served at bed time will be 
found advisable.

CHAPTER XV 
DIET IN" DISORDERS OF NUTRITION 

DIET IN DIABETES 

Diabetes Mellitus is a condition of the body in which carbo- 
liydrates are not fully utilized and accumulate in the blood as 
sugar (glucose) until a certain concentration is reached, wlien 
the sugar is excreted in the urine. Diabetes is believed to be 
due to a deficiency in the internal secretion of the pancreas. 

During the progress of the disease, the power to use carbo- 
hydrate decreases; there is also a loss in the ability to use pro- 
tein and fat. The sugar in the blood may come from proteins 
as well as from carboliydrate. In severe cases proteins and 
fats give rise to acids which are responsible for the complica- 
tion called acidosis or ketonuria, so common in diabetes. 
Ketonuria is believed to be a direct factor in causing coma. 

It is essential that any line of treatment result in a sugar 
free urine. The acids disappear during the treatment now 
used, and so are treated incidentally. 

It is found that acidosis is very apt to ensue if carbohydrate 
be suddenly withdrawn and fat substituted, consequently it is 
advantageous to use a preparatory period, which precedes the 
starvation treatment introduced by Dr. Allen, to whom we 
owe much of the knowledge of the best way to treat diabetes 
mellitus. 

DR. JOSLINS PREPARATORY TREATMENT 

Withdraw fat from the diet. In two days withdraw pro- 
tein. Two days later, halve the carbohydrate, and continue 
to halve the remainder each day until but 10 grams are given. 
Begin the fast. 

366 



DISORDERS OF NUTRITION 357 

THE FASTING PERIOD 

This treatment is successful only when the urine becomes 
sugar free. Fast two to four days or longer, until the desired 
result is obtained. Give water, tea, coffee and broth freely 
during the fast. They prevent hunger and are stimulating. 

CARBOHYDRATE FEEDING 

When feeding begins, it is important that there be no 
repetition of the same vegetable during a single day. 
Monotony in the diet of adults must be avoided if the best 
results are to be obtained. Green vegetables containing not 
over per cent, carbohydrate prevent constipation. If given 
raw or steamed, no carbohydrate is lost and the valuable salts 
are conserved. If the patient cannot take even this small 
amount of carbohydrate, the vegetables may be made to lose 
much starch by boiling in three waters, throwing the first two 
away after the vegetable has cooked for a few minutes, and 
then cook at least fifteen minutes in all. These are " thrice 
cooked vegetables." ^ 

A DIABETIC CHART 
Dr. Elliott P. Joslin2 

The intelligent management of a case of diabetes mellitus 
requires frequent comparisons between the diet, the urinary 
analyses and the weight of the patient. These data are often 
printed or written down in four or five different places, and 
the labor of uniting them is so great that it is seldom at- 
tempted. Any accurate study of a case is thus extremely 
difficult, and in hospitals past records are almost useless. To 
facilitate the treatment of diabetic patients and to eliminate 
some of the annoying sources of error, we have used a chart 
for some years upon which some of these facts were recorded. 

1 Note page 262 for general directions in cooking " thrice cooked vegetables."

Our cliart was designed chiefly for the benefit of the physician, 
in contrast to the charts in use in various German clinics, 
Avliich have a broader application and are of direct help not 
only to the phjsician, but also to the nurse and the patient 
as well. By this latter arrangement the chart becomes the 
nurse's record, and upon it the nurse writes what the patient 
actually eats. We have attempted to combine the two methods 
on the following chart, and hope that it will be found helpful 
and suggestive in the treatment of diabetic patients. 

Space is reserved upon the chart for the Doctor's orders and 
the nurse's recorc^ as well as the urinary analyses. There is 
given, in addition, a statement of the foods commonly allowed 
in a strict diabetic diet, with the percent of carbohydrates in 
other foods which are occasionally employed. 

SUGGESTED DIET FOR DIABETES UNDER FASTING TREATMENT 

Observation Diet. — The severity of diabetes is determined 
by an observation diet for forty-eight hours. 

Fast Until Sugar-Free. — The patient is placed in bed (if 
necessary) and n^ade to fast until sugar free. Xo food is 
given with the exception of coffee, tea or broth and whiskey 
if necessary, quantity depending upon the physician's judg- 
ment. 

Carbohydrate Test. — Start with 10 grams of carbohydrates 
in green 5 per cent, vegetables, increase 10 grams daily until 
sugar appears in urine. Vegetables are given as salads raw or 
steamed. 

First Day — 10 grams carbohydrates. Total calories, 65.

DIET IN IITHEMIA OR EXCESS OF URIC ACID 

Treatment for Uric Acid. Exercise in the open air- 
walk— plenty of fresh air by night as well as by day. 
Breathe deeply. Bathe often; rub the body thoroughly after- 
ward ; the skin should play an important part in elimination 
of uric acid. 

To prevent the formation of an over supply of uric acid, 
be careful of diet. The first thing, do not eat meat. You 
may eat nuts with salt, fresh ripe fruit; best of all, apples 
unpeeled; all cooked fruits, but very little sugar in them; 
all vegetables that grow above ground (not those that grow 
below ground); greens are especially good, with good cider 
vinegar. Bread may be eaten in moderation, graham and 
entire wheat best, good water crackers, cereals of all kind?; 
eggs should be used sparingly, and in severe cases not at all. 
Fish is good, also shellfish. No pastry or sweet cake ; milk 
and cheese may be used freely, also buttermilk. Drink no 
coffee, tea, malt or alcoholic liquors. Drink pure water and 
a great deal of it ; sometimes it is well to u.se lithia tablets.

DIET IN GOUT 
Mary Swartz Rose, Ph.D. 2 

Gout is a disease of the overfed rather than the under- 
nourished. Luxurious living, witli its constant temptation to 
overeat, especially of protein foods, and to avoid exercise, 
often brings its penalty in the form of acute or chronic gout. 
Indulgence in alcoholic beverages, especially as an accompani- 
ment to a sumptuous repast, increases a man's chances of ac- 
quiring the disease. Sometimes he suffers for the sins of 
his ancestors, the tendency to the disease being said to be 
transmissible. There are usually disturbances of the diges- 
tive system — gastric indigestion, intestinal putrefaction, and 
constipation — but the most constant symptom is an excess 
of uric acid in the blood, indicating a faulty elimination of 
this substance. Uric acid is formed in the body, but in 
health it is excreted in the urine, so that the amount in cir- 
culation in the blood is very small. In gout this acid ac- 
cumulates in the blood and is eliminated with difficulty. The 
following are to be avoided: (1) all foods which disturb di- 
gestion; (2) all foods which tend to induce intestinal putre- 
faction and constipation; (3) all excess of total fuel and of 
protein food; and (4) all foods which by their composition

tend to increase the amount of uric acid which the body has 
to get rid of. Uric acid belongs to a group of closely related 
substances called purins. These are found in flesh foods of 
all kinds and in some vegetable foods. The purins other than 
uric acid m these foods are mostly converted into uric acid 
m the body. Hence, if elimination is faulty, they raise the 
amount of uric acid in the blood, a condition considered very 
unfavorable in cases of gout, though the relation of this sub- 
stance to the disease is not fully understood. The taking of 
alcoholic beverages also tends to hinder uric acid elimination, 
and these should be excluded in gout. 

The treatment is largely dietetic and the diet should be 
adapted to the needs of the patient by tlie physician. Some 
information, however, as to the purin content of foods will 
be helpful in carrying out his orders. Milk, eggs, cheese, 
nuts, gelatin, fruits, sugars, breadstuffs made with white flour,' 
cornstarch, tapioca farina, rice, potatoes and other root vege- 
tables, most green vegetables (spinach and asparagus ex- 
cepted), and all kinds of fat are practically purin-free. 

Sweetbreads, kidney, liver, sardines, and anchovies are very 
rich in purins and should be entirely avoided. Beef, veal, 
mutton, pork, chicken, turkey, goose and other kinds of 'game' 
fish with the exception of cod are fairly liigh in purin content! 
and should be sparingly if at all indulged in. Boiling meat 
will remove some of the purins ; hence boiled meats are some- 
times allowed where roasted or broiled ones are not. Among 
vegetable foods, spinach, asparagus, peas, and beans are rich- 
est in purins, though none of these contains as much as meat. 
A dietary indicating the type of food best adapted to use in 
gout is given on the following page.

380 DIET IX DISEASE 

DIET IN ACUTE RHEUMATISM 
Thompson i 

Dietetic Treatment. While the fever lasts and other symp- 
toms are acute, such as pain and swelling of the joints, the 
patient should be put upon a fluid diet. The majority of 
cases do best at this time with an exclusive milk or bread- 
and-milk diet. Those patients who cannot take milk, how- 
ever, may be allowed soups and broths flavored with vegetable 
extracts, chicken tea, milk toast, barley or oatmeal gruel, 
clam broth. 

Thirst is often a prominent symptom, especially if there 
be much fever, and it is advisable for the patient to drink 
fluid freely to assist in washing out the waste products from 
the body. Lemonade and slightly acid drinks of various 
kinds, such as dilute phosphoric acid or the effervescent min- 
eral waters, are recommended. Boiled milk and Seltzer or 
Vichy may be drunk, or oatmeal or barley water flavored 
with lemon. Alcohol should be avoided while the acute symp- 
toms last, unless the complication of inflammation of the 
endocardium or pericardium enfeeble the heart action, if pro- 
longed and anaemia is considerable, alcohol may be given as 
a tonic two or three times a day in the form of a glass of 
claret or Burgundy (one to two ounces), or diluted whiskey. 

During convalescence the appetite is not usually vigorous, 
and it is not necessary to urge the taking of much food at 
first. The diet should be principally farinaceous, but not 
saccharine. 

Such articles may be given as rice (plain or spiced), arrow- 
root, oatmeal, cornmeal, semolina, wheaten grits, panada, 
milk toast, simple unsweetened puddings, wine jelly, blanc- 
mange and malted foods. 

The return to solid diet should be gradual, and for a long 
time the patient should abstain from eating meats as well as 
from pastry and sweets. Fagge states that no meat or fish 
should be allowed for at least a week after subsidence of the

DISORDERS OF NUTRITION 381 

fever and acute symptoms, or, better, for a fortnight, and 
many believe that beef tea is harmful. Meat can undoubtedly 
induce a relapse. 

When convalescence becomes established, eggs, fish, oysters, 
and white meat of broiled or roasted chickens may be given, 
and one or two such vegetables as asparagus, spinach, or 
stewed celery, with a baked apple or fresh fruit, but sweets 
and alcohol should long be withheld. 

The patient should be fed often, having one or two extra 
lunches during the day, for anaemia is apt to prevail for some 
time, and abundant nutriment is required.

DIET IN OBESITY 

This is one of the most important features of dietetic 
therapy, and is older and better known than any other, prob- 
ably because of its connection with conditioning athletes for 
all kinds of contests and also -from the cosmetic poiwt of 
view, as superfluous flesh generally implies advanced years. 
Unlike many other plans of diet it concerns the nominally 
healthy rather than the sick and invalid. 

The old trainer of athletes knew^ little or nothing of any 
scientific regimen for reducing adipose tissue. For him re- 
duction of weight w-as merely a matter of getting rid of 
superfluous water, to be accomplished by sweating, purgation 
and abstinence from fluids. He rejected certain articles of 
diet as "bad for the wind," but this is as near as he came 
to specializing in diet. Exercise, without profuse perspira- 
tion, meant nothing to him. The steady grind of a worker 
who burns up so much excess fat daily, yet withojit any un- 
usual degree of perspiration, is something he took no ac- 
count of. 

Of recent years it has been learned that abstinence, hot 
baths and purgation, are far less efficacious in keeping down 
■weight than continuous and vigorous exercise within the fa- 
tigue limit. It is much less a matter of starvation and elim- 
ination than of a steady oxidation of superfluous tissue by 
graded and varied exercises extending throughout the day. 
But w^hile constant exercise is the chief essential, it is also 
important to curb the appetite for food and drink, and to 
keep the excretory organs active. Otherwise, in the case of 
novices at least, increased exercise will provoke increased 
appetite for food and drink, so that not a few people gain 
flesh while trying to lose it. 

Doubtless the best plan for reducing flesh without suffering 
and violence is to do a great amount of work daily, severe 
enough in character to oxidize much body fat, but without 



DISORDERS OF NUTRITION 383 

profuse waste of fluids by sweating, etc. In regard to the 
meals, these should be small, light and as frequent as desired. 
Nothing should be taken to provoke thirst. Any food-article 
whatever which is especially rich in starch, sugar or fat, along 
with alcoholics, must be omitted. Such individuals thrive 
best on toast or biscuit without butter; lean meatS; fish and 
eggs; and vegetables which grow above ground. 

The selection of food differs but little from the diabetic 
regimen, but some carbohydrates are allowed, while the fatty 
articles, including milk, permissible in diabetes, are to be 
avoided. The patient is not to be stinted in quantity pro- 
vided he takes the necessary amount of exercise. He may 
breakfast freely on eggs, meat and toast, dine on meats and 
salad vegetables, etc. He shoald take as little fluid as possi- 
ble with his meals, but may quench his thirst between meals. 
By masticating his food thoroughly he materially reduces the 
demand, and does away with eating for the mere sake of eat- 
ing. 

By simple measures of this sort an individual may reduce 
his weight to as great degree as desirable, and the process 
will not be painful, but the reverse. He simply oxidizes and 
otherwise utilizes a little more matter than he takes in, and 
thereby prevents a pathological and unsafe accumulation of 
fat

ACUTE GASTEITIS 
Einhom i 

During the first or second day of illness it is best not to 
give the patient anything substantial to eat. Strained barley 
or rice water, or weak tea may be taken. On the third day, 
as soon as the appetite reappears, the patient is permitted to 
partake of water soup (bread and hot water) oatmeal or bar- 
ley gruel, rice soup, and perhaps one soft-cooked egg. Later 
on French bread, butter and oysters may be added to the 
dietary'. 

If the improvement is steadily progressing the fourth day 
begin with meat once a day, and thus slowly return to the 
usual bill of fare. 

DIET IN CHRONIC GASTRITIS 
Einhom i 

The regulation of the diet is of prime importance in the 
treatment. The dietary to be selected will depend on the 
severity of the symptoms. 

At the beginning, therefore, a light diet will be called 
for. The patient should partake of four meals daily. The 
articles of food should be given largely in liquid and semi- 
liquid forms; that is, milk, kumyss, matzoon, barley, oat- 
meal, and rice soup prepared in milk; chicken soup with an 
egg beaten up in it ; soft-cooked eggs, mashed potatoes, scraped 
meat, raw, or broiled, toasted bread, and also French white 
bread (not too fresh) ; butter; tea and cocoa.

The patient having been kept on this diet for a week or 
two, the diet must be gradually changed to one suitable for 
the lighter forms of chronic gastritis. Here the following 
rule will apply: The diet should correspond as nearly as 
possible to the common mode of living. In this way the dis- 
tribution of the meals sliould be arranged according to the 
customs prevailing in those places in which the patient lives. 

All food derived from the vegetable kingdom should bo 
given in large portions, while the quantity of meat should be 
somewhat limited. 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 387 

In order to permit the patient to have a greater variety 
in his food, it is best not to point out a few articles he 
should eat, but to mention only those he should avoid. For- 
bid meat with very tough fibers, meat from too old animals 
or too fresh meat (right after slaughtering), meat that eon- 
tains too much fat, like pork; forbid sausages, lobster, sal- 
mon, chicken salad, mayonnaise, cucumbers, pickles, cabbage, 
strong alcoholic drinks like liquors. 

It must be impressed upon the patient to masticate the 
food thoroughly, to eat slowly, not to think of business dur- 
ing meals, and to stop eating before the sensation of satiety 
appears. The latter advice is only necessary in persons who 

are accustomed to high living. 

******** 

Chronic gastric catarrh is frequently combined with con- 
stipation. The diet can be arranged as to facilitate move- 
ment of the bowels. All foods which contain a large per- 
centage of cellulose (undigested matter) increase the quantity 
of feces, thereby effecting a stronger peristalsis of the larger 
bowel. 

All kind of green vegetables (spinach, asparagus, green 
peas) and rye bread are therefore very suitable. Many or- 
ganic acids possess the property of increasing intestinal peri- 
stalsis. Almost all kinds of fruits contain a certain quantity 
of these organic acids, and act like mild aperients. The use 
of cooked pears, stewed or baked apples, stewed prunes, is in 
many instances effective. Ewald recommends a mixture of 
two parts of prunes to one part of dried figs. The taste is 
agreeable, and the cathartic action mild. The custom of 
eating an orange in the morning for its laxative effect is well 
known. To these dietary remedies we may also add the use 
of a glassful of either very cold or warm water, or a glass of 
milk in arising, in the fasting condition. 

There are many persons in whom one of these latter means 
produces a good movement of the bowels.

DIET IN GASTRIC HYPERACIDITY 

The dietetic treatment of gastric hyperacidity is very im- 
portant because it virtually is equivalent to the preventive 
diet of gastric ulcer and to diet after recovery from the lat- 
ter. It should be extremely simple and bland, consisting of 
but few dishes of easily digested solids, together with milk. 
Sweets cannot be used. Carbohydrates are obtained from 
bread and potatoes in relatively small amounts; while the 
protein content is relatively high because this combines with 
the acid of the gastric juice. Vegetables are limited to well 
cooked greens, green peas, etc. All bulky food which leaves 
residues and all irritant substances are naturally out of place 
in a bland diet.

FOODS FROM WHICH THE DIET IN GASTEIC HYPERACIDITY 

MAY BE CHOSEN 

Dr. Herbert S. Carter i 

DIET: Raw oysters: 

iioups. — Cream or pur4e (except tomato). 

Fish.— Fresh cod, halibut, bass, boiled with cream sauce or broiled. 

ileat.— Beei well done (without gristle, fat, or gra\-y), chicken, 
turkev, guinea hen, lamb (without fat), once daily.

Bavarian cream, floating island, cup custard, junket, soft rice or 
bread puddings. Gelatin desserts made with little flavoring. Very 
little sugar used in all desserts. Fruit, none, except when constipa- 
tion is a marked feature, then stewed soft fruits may be taken in 
good amount, but must be cooked with very little sugar and are 
best taken with or after a meal, never before. Cream may usually 
be freely used.

TTLCER OF THE STOMACH 
Dr. Max Einhorn i 
The diet consists of liquids — milk, milk with strained 
barley, or oatmeal, or rice water; plain water, weak tea and 
peptone (one teaspoon to a cup of water). Debove and 
Remond have suggested the addition of lactose and of meat 
powder to the milk, in order to make the diet richer in 
nutritive substances.

390 DIET IN DISEASE 

As a rule, we employ the above-named additions, which 
fulfill the same purposes, besides varying the monotonous bill 
01 tare. 

First week. During the first week we give the patient half 
a cup (about 100-150 c.c.) of either, every hour. Every- 
thing the patient takes must be neither cold nor very warm 
and should be taken slowly (sipping, or with a spoon). 

Second week. During the second week we order the same 
kind of food, with this difference, that he is nourished every 
two hours, and gets a cupful or a cupful and a half (200 to 
300 c.c.) at a time. 

Occasionally we now allow the patient one raw egg beaten 
up m the milk, once or twice a day. In the beginning of the 
third week we feed the patient every three hours; he is al- 
lowed barley, farina, and rice (well cooked) in milk, soft- 
cooked eggs, crackers softened in milk, in addition to his 
previous foods; in the third day of the third week we begin 
to give the patient meat, first raw, well scraped, then broiled. 

Thereafter we go over to the ordinary dailv diet, exclud- 
mg heavy salads, pastry, raw fruit and the like. 

In the following table I give an outline of diet which I 
ordinarily prescribe in this affection :

In cases of ulcer of the stomach presenting a more severe 
type — violent pains, frequent vomiting, inability to take 
food on account of the pains — or after haematemesis, I 
usually have the patient abstain from any food whatever 
given by the mouth, for a period of five days. The patient 
IS then fed by the rectum. This is done in the following way : 
early each morning the patient receives a large enema of 
about a quart of lukewarm water, in which a teaspoonful of 
common tablesalt has been dissolved as a cleansing enema 
About an hour after the patient has emptied the injected 
water the first nourishing enema is given ; this may consist 
either of a glassful of milk (about 200 c.c), in which a raw 
egg has been well beaten and a pinch of salt added, or of a 
cupful of water in which a tablespoon of a good peptone 
preparation has been dissolved. The temperature of either 
must be about 100° F. Such a nourishing enema is given 



DISEASES OF THE STOMACH 393 

three or four times a day. The quantity of the feeding enema 
is 200-250 c.c, and it is slowly injected by means of a foun- 
tain syringe and a soft-rubber rectal tube. The patient may 
frequently wash his mouth with cold water, and is allowed 
from time to time to keep a small piece of chopped ice in 
his mouth, and to swallow the melted water. The five days 
being over, the mode of diet is the same as described above 
for the ordinary form of ulcer. 

DIET FOR ACTIVE ULCER OF THE STOMACH OR DUODENUM 
Massachusetts General Hospital i 

For two days — 2 oz. milk with one powdered cracker (S^^ in. 
square ) . Given every two hours. 

The next ten days — 8 oz. milk, 4 crackers, 2 to 4 oz. sugar. Given 
every two hours. 

The next month — In eight feedings, every two hours — ( 1 ) Indian 
meal mush with cream and salt (1 helping). (2) Eight 
oimces of milk with crackers and sugar. (3) Potato Puree. 
(4) Milk and whites of two eggs. (5) Soft Custard (1 serv- 
ing). (6) Chocolate with cream (1 cup). (7) Pea Purge. 
(8) Milk, crackers and sugar. 

The next four months — In six feedings a day. Add tapioca, boiled 
rice, macaroni, mashed potatoes, soft toast with butter, soft 
boiled eggs, wheat germ, shredded wheat. 

THE LENHARTZ DIET 

The "Lenhartz diet" begins with 100 c.c. milk and one 
egg daily, in teaspoonful doses, gradually increasing until 
at the end of four weeks a liberal mixed diet is allowed, al- 
ways avoiding coarse vegetables and irritating substances. 

The gradual increase of food appears in the accompanying 
scale. 

In preparing the eggs they are beaten very light, without 
salt, a small amount of sugar frequently added, to bowl kept 
in a pan of cracked ice. At first the milk is given with 
shaved ice. Some of the milk, eggs, and sugar are made into 
custard on the tenth day. The beef is scraped and weighed 
after cooking; occasionally lime water has to be added to 
the milk, and, if large curds form, the milk is diluted with

CHAPTER XVII 
DIET IN" INTESTINAL DISEASES 

DIET IN DYSPEPSIA 

Modern clinical medicine does not recognize such a dis- 
ease as dyspepsia. In a great variety of local and general 
conditions digestion is more or less disordered. It may be 
too rapid, too slow, difficult, imperfect for one or more of 
the classes of foods, or abolished outright. Specialists base 
diets largely on the results of test-meals, so that the diet in 
a given case becomes individualized. If a person with ordi- 
nary symptoms of chronic indigestion is to be dieted, and 
the cause of the affection is not known, the regimen for 
chronic gastritis will answer. But if in addition to in- 
digestion there is unusual irritability of the stomach, the 
diet must consist of most easily digested articles of solid food, 
and if necessary of semi-solid or liquid food. In other words, 
he is dieted like a convalescent from some severe acute dis- 
ease, or a child at weaning time. 

DIET IN CONSTIPATION 

It is almost as difficult to prescribe a diet for constipation 
as it is for dyspepsia, and for the same reason, namely, con- 
stipation is not in itself a disease, but a symptom or result of 
many diseases. As a general rule, however, a certain diet is 
more or less suitable for any kind of constipation. By the 
latter term we usually mean a delayed action of the bowels 
due to a natural weakness of the muscles of the intestines, or 
to an acquired weakness due to too concentrated a form of 
nourishment or to a sedentary life. In a certain percentage 
of cases the delayed action of the bowels is due to temporary 

396 



INTESTINAL DISEASES 397 

spasm of the intestinal muscle and this ma}- even occur in 
association with weakness of the muscle, as is seen in hysteri- 
cal women. There is finally delayed bowel action in a great 
number and variety of diseases. 

The resources employed in treating the diseases which 
cause constipation include many plans beside diet, yet the 
latter is indispensable. 

A mixed diet is very necessary, for purely animal food 
products, as meat, fish, eggs, milk, cheese, etc., conduce to 
constipation because absorption of such foods is so nearly 
complete that not enough residue remains in the intestines to 
stimulate peristalsis. On the other hand, a diet of vegetables, 
involving a large indigestible residue, causes large fecal mo- 
tions, but these are not promptly expelled unless the intestine 
is liealthy. Much extra work is thrown upon the intestine 
when a vegetarian diet is used exclusively; and as a result 
of such excessive work the intestine may become in time weak- 
ened. 

Constipation from whatever cause and of whatever nature 
may be, when sufficiently pronounced, sufficient to render a 
healthy man or woman sick. Digestion becomes impaired, 
appetite lost. This fact alone teaches us that in dieting a 
constipated subject we often have to deal with a sick in- 
dividual. Hence the only course to pursue is to cure the con- 
dition which causes the constipation as soon as possible. For 
mere sluggish action of the bowels, not amounting to disease, 
many popular dietetic remedies are employed. 

Of household dietetic procedures for securing daily evacua- 
tions, the most common is the drinking of cold water on ris- 
ing — one, two or more glasses. To this a little common salt 
may be added. The use of fruit at or before breakfast often 
causes an evacuation during the day. This is true especially 
of apples, pears, oranges, etc. Buttermilk is also largely 
used for this purpose. The vegetable acids with the large 
amount of indigestible residue make certain fruits valuable 
as laxatives, although those berries which contain tannin as 
blackberries may tend to constipate. Dried fruits, such as 



398 DIET IN DISEASE 

figs and prunes are especially useful. The efficacy of sweet 
cider seems to illustrate again the laxative power of vegetable 
acids. Very sweet substances in large amounts, chiefly 
honey and molasses, are notably laxative. Oatmeal, among 
the cereal foods,' is noted for its laxative powers. Oils and 
fats are laxative to many people. A word of caution must 
here be inserted. Many of these substances occasionally be- 
have as violent purgatives, especially in individuals who al- 
ternate between constipation and diarrhea. The severe diar- 
rhea set up at times by sweet cider, molasses and other rela- 
tively inert substances should teach us caution in giving such 
articles to patients. 

Xo more important hygienic regimen can be adopted than the fol- 
lowing: 1. Eat fruit daily (experiment and find what fruit seems 
to agree). 2. Three-quarters of an hour before breakfast drink 
one glass of hot or cold water and exercise ten minutes in room 
before open window or take a brisk walk. Drink at least three 
pints of water daily. If needed take one or two tablespoons of raw 
bran daily. 

DIET IN CONSTIPATION 
Massachusetts General Hospital i 

Plan diet in following manner, eating the usual quantity of 
foods presented and using the variety allowed in list : 

Breakfast. — Cereal with cream and sugar — preferably corn meal, 
or rye and oats. 
Two soft boiled or i<crambled eggs. 
Bread — Preferably black bread or pumpernickel, or 

rye bread, with much butter. 
Fruit — Apples or grapes. 
Dinner. — Soup — preferably vegetable soup. 
Fish or meat, or both, with salad. 

Vegetables — at least two kinds, preferably spinach, cab- 
bage, beets, turnips, potatoes, beans or peas if desired. 
Dessert of rice or bread pudding or custard — including 
daily a saucer of prunes or saucer of tamarinds. 
Supper. — Bread and Butter. 
Cocoa. 

Cold meat and vegetable salad. 

Dessert of stewed fruit — apples or pears or figs. If neces- 
sary, include a saucer of prunes or plums ( preserved ) . 

1 Diet used at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Mass., 1917. 



INTESTINAL DISEASES 399 

Drink at least three pints of water daily. 

Omit all drugs for constipation. 

Agar Agar Powder — tablespoonful twice daily. 

DIET IN DIABRHEA 

The terra diarrhea, like dyspepsia and constipation, repre- 
sents only a symptom or result of various diseases. While 
this affection cannot be cured by a dietetic plan alone, at- 
tention to diet is very important. It consists as much in 
avoiding laxative articles as in using constipating articles 
which are also bland and easily digested. Food nearly all of 
which may be absorbed naturally antagonizes diarrhea from 
any cause. The commonest articles used in this class are 
flour porridge, cooked white of eggs, boiled milk, toasted 
crackers, zwieback, rice, chocolate. Meat should be of the 
most tender and digestible nature, as sweetbreads, tongue, 
tenderloin of beef, etc. Dried beef powder may be mixed 
with 5 per cent, tannic acid. Articles which naturally con- 
tain the latter are useful if digestible. Acorn coffee is recom- 
mended by some. 

In a daily menu compiled by Ewald the following articles 
enter: Soft eggs, milk, toasted bread, zwieback, scraped 
beef, breast of chicken, the most digestible kinds of fish, 
soups and broths (to the latter may be added Sanatogen and 
other semi-proprietary condensed protein foods). Articles 
used in diet list for constipation must be avoided. 

DIET IN DYSENTERY 
Dr. Thompson i 

During an attack of acute dysenter}' the patient should be 
kept absolutely quiet in bed, and should not be allowed to 
rise for the movement of the bowels, making use of a bed- 
pan instead. Throughout the active stage the diet must be 
strictly confined to easily digestible food, and in most cases it 
is wisest to give only predigested fluid articles. Peptonised 
or pancreatinised milk, or boiled milk, pressed-meat juice, 
whey, or raw egg albumin beaten with sherry and flavored

Appleton & Co.

with nutmeg are recommended. Many patients do best upon 
a diet of raw scraped beef or meat balls. 

In cases of acute dysenter}^, and especially in the amoebic 
form, the loss of strength, anaemia, and emaciation progress 
very rapidly, and the strength must be supported by stimula- 
tion, for which brandy is preferable to whiskey. 

During convalescence the diet must be very cautiously in- 
creased, and confined to food which is promptly and com- 
pletely digested, leaving but little residue. For this purpose 
animal food should be chiefly eaten, while fish, tender beef- 
steak, roast beef, boiled or broiled chicken, eggs, custard, 
blanc-mange, dry toast, junket, well-boiled rice, or wine jelly, 
may be given. All fruits and vegetables must be forbidden, 
and butter and cream should be taken sparingly. 

If the the disease occurs in infancy, the child, if possible, 
should be fed at the breast. Otherwise all milk and water 
given should be pasteurized. Beef tea and mutton broth 
may be allowed in moderation, and special care should be 
observed not to overfeed.

milk diet of from two and a half to three quarts a day, with

rest in bed or on the lounge. In other cases rare steak or 
roast beef or chicken and egg albumin may be allowed, with 
dry toasted, zwieback, or crackers. The milk and meat diet 
may be advantageously combined. 

In Osier's opinion, if there is much ulceration of the colon, 
meat is not well borne, and it is better to keep the patient 
upon a diet which will give but little residue, such as boiled 
or peptonised milk. 

The stools must be examined every day or two to ascertain 
the presence of undigested fragments of milk curds or meats, 
oil globules, mucus, blood, etc. If improvement does not 
occur, the patient may be put upon a diet of egg albumin or 
Sanatogen with beef juice, or some of the preparations of beef 
meal or peptonoids, with pancreatinised milk. Eeturn to 
solid diet must be very gradual, and may be conducted on 
the lines directed for convalescence from typhoid fever.

SCHMIDT'S INTESTINAL TEST DIET 

This is not necessarily a series of test meals, such as are 
employed for diagnosis in diseases of the stomach, for it may 
be used as a steady regimen, the test of the efficacy of which 
is shown by the character of the stools, which should consist 
in health only of the indigestible residue of the food. It is 
adapted to the healthy, as well as to those with intestinal dis- 
orders. All foods with considerable amounts of indigestible 
residue are forbidden, but no attempt is made to eliminate 
all residues, for such a step would favor the occurrence of 
constipation. The diet should be properly balanced and con- 
tain sufficient calories for the daily requirement. 

The diet as advocated by Schmidt has been in use in a 
slightly modified form at the Massachusetts General Hos- 
pital. Instead of oatmeal gruel, corn meal mush is used; 
while mashed potatoes are substituted for potato broth. In 
subjects with intestinal aifections, the failure to digest some 
or more of the principal classes of foods, as shown by study 
of the feces, leads to a change in diet. Many normally healthy 
subjects may benefit by such a diet, which may be rendered 
less monotonous by introducing alternate dishes.

DIET FOR INTESTINAL PUTREFACTION 

As putrefaction is limited chiefly to animal proteins, an 
antiputrefactive diet is a restricted vegetarian diet in which 
milk, cheese and eggs are allowed in small quantities, but 
no meats. The patient lives principally upon bread, potatoes, 
cereals, fruits, and green vegetables. Such a diet agrees 
closely with those in use for Bright's disease, high blood 
pressure, the self poisoning of pregnancy, and in fact, in any 
condition supposed to be caused or aggravated by excess of 
animal protein.

DIET IN APPENDICITIS 
Dr. Thompson i 

Dietetic Treatment. The dietetic treatment of appendici- 
tis, which has not yet passed into the surgeon's hands, should 
consist in giving only such foods as will be thoroughly ab- 
sorbed, leaving as little residue as possible to irritate the lower 
bowel and excite peristalsis. 

Until the outcome of the attack is decided it is best to put 
the patient upon a fluid diet, consisting chiefly of nutritive 
broths. Beaten eggs may be allowed, and a moderate quan- 
tity of pancreatinised milk, whey, or buttermilk. Cocoa may 
be given, and strained gruels of rice and barley. 

In recurrent cases the patient should be cautioned to eat 
moderately and avoid all coarse or hard food, such as grits, 
coarse oatmeal, tough meats, fibrous vegetables, the skin of 
fruits or potatoes — in short, everything likely to overload 
the intestine with accumulated waste. 

The operative cases should have the diet recommended 
after laparotomy. Usually the digestive organs require al- 
most absolute rest for twenty-four hours after the operation, 
and hot water may be sipped. No food at all should be given 
for fully six hours before operation.

CHAPTER XVIII 
DIET IN DISEASES OF THE GENITO-URINARY SYSTEM 

ACUTE BRIGHTS DISEASE 

In dieting a patient suffering from acute Bright's disease, 
one fact to be kept prominently in mind is the difficulty that 
the system has in getting rid of its waste material — espe- 
cially of its nitrogenous waste. Another point is that the 
diet should be such as to assist in carrying off those inflam- 
matory products by which we know that the tubules of the 
kidneys are to a greater or less extent blocked. The amount 
of nitrogenous elements in foods must be kept down, and aid 
must be given for washing out the products of inflammation 
from the uriniferous tubules. 

"Water is the best diuretic. — Hot water and hot diluent 
drinks. 

Diluted milk is the food that answers best, and skimmed 
milk has a high reputation as a diuretic. Buttermilk, whey 
and kumyss are useful. 

From two to three pints of milk, well diluted, given in the 
twenty-four hours, will in most cases be sufficient at first, 
but if the disease be protracted and tends to become chronic, 
a more liberal allowance of liquid food must be ordered, and 
broths may be added to the dietary. "WTien milk alone is 
given it should be given in divided quantities at stated in- 
tervals — half a pint every three or four hours, diluted with 
half as much hot water or effervescing water. 

Between supplies of milk drink freely of diluent drinks. 

Diluent DrinJcs. Plain water, toast water, barley water, 
cream of tartar and lemon drinks, and the acid drinks are all 
useful diluents. 

Give between meals and drink slowly. 

405 



406 DIET IN DISEASE 

DIET IN CHRONIC BRIGHT'S DISEASE 

Tlie kidneys are great agents in the work of eicreting ni- 
trogenous waste, and sliglit inability to perform functions 
prevent elimination of nitrogenous waste. 

As soon as we have evidence sufficient to prove that the 
kidneys are laboring and are burdened by their work, we must 
endeavor to/emove the strain by regulating the diet; and one 
clear indication is to limit the supplies of nitrogenous foods. 

Large amounts of animal food and the use of alcohol must 
be stopped. 

In many cases the effect of feeding the patient for six 
weeks, or even two or three months, upon an exclusive milk 
diet, is remarkably gratifying. The quantity of milk to be 
prescribed for an exclusive milk diet in Bright's disease must 
depend on the age and size of the patient, as well as upon 
his ability to take exercise and use up force in muscular en- 
ergy. If the patient is invalided so as to be confined to his 
room or the house, from five to seven pints of milk daily are 
quite sufficient. If the patient loses weight on a milk diet, 
although it otherwise agrees with him, it may be well to add 
farinaceous food in the shape of rice or bread. In the worst 
cases it is desirable to give the milk at brief intervals, 
in quantities of six ounces, once an hour during the day- 
time, with an extra tumblerful at night, and on awakening 
in the morning. 

The quantity of milk necessary to support life for any 
length of time and maintain good nutrition, especially if 
the patient is exercising at all, is considerable, and he must 
take from fourteen to eighteen, or even twenty-two six-ounce 
tumblerfuls of milk in the twenty-four hours. 

It is usually impossible to commence at this rate without 
producing gastric disturbances from souring of the milk in 
the stomach, and possibly diarrhoea. The latter symptom 
is an almost certain indication that the milk is being im- 
perfectly digested, and a temporary reduction in its quantity 
is advised. 



GENITO-URINARY SYSTEM 40? 

In very advanced cases when the ability of the kidneys to 
excrete protein has passed a certain stage a pure milk diet 
is out of the question, since it contains far too much protein. 
See Diet lists. 

As the patient improves the milk diet may be given up. 
but it should never be too suddenly abandoned In adopting 
any other diet it is a good rule never to let the nitrogenous 
food bear a greater proportion to the non-nitrogenous than 
one to four. 

'Wlien, after a milk diet, the change is to be made to a more 
liberal menu, the hours of taking the milk may be reduced 
in frequency, and some of the milk may be replaced by the 
more hearty food. 

DIET: Soup. — Vegetable or fish soup, broths with rice or barley. 

Fish. — Raw oysters or clams, fresh fish broiled or boiled. 

Meats. — Eat sparingly, chicken, game, fat bacon, fat ham. 

Farinaceous. — Stale bread, wliole wlieat bread, toast, milk toast, 
biscuits, macaroni, rice, cereals of all kinds. 

Vegetables. — Onion, cauliflower, mashed potatoes, mushrooms, let- 
tuce, watercress, spinach, celery, cabbage. 

Desserts. — Ripe raw fruits, stewed fruits, rice, tapioca, bread and 
milk puddings, junkets, cocoa. 

Liquids. — Toast water, weak tea, pure water, peptonised milk, 
malted milk, fresh buttermilk, milk with hot water equal parts, 
uhey, unfermented grape juice. 

AVOID. — Fried fish, corned beef, hashes, stews, pork, veal, heavy 
bread, batter cakes, lamb, mutton, beef, gravies, beans, peas, malt 
or spirituous liquors, tobacco, cofl'ee, ice cream, cake, pastry.

DIET IN ALBUMINURIA 
Thompson 2 

Dietetic Treatment. The frequent return of functional 
albuminuria should be regarded as an indication of special 
weakness of the kidneys in the same way that frequent 
glycosuria invites suspicion of the strength of the digestive 
power of the liver, and it demands a careful regulation of 
the diet. Meat should be reduced in quantity, or temporarily 
forbidden, as well as all forms of alcoholic drinks, or other 
substances liable to produce renal irritation, and the diet 
should consist chiefly of fruits, vegetables, and milk. Care- 
ful attention must be paid to increasing the activity of the 
bowels.

410 DIET IN DISEASE 

When functional albuminuria is observed in children and 
adolescents the following dietary from which a variety of 
foods may be selected is recommended. 

Diet : — Bacon, sweetbreads, custards, butter, cream, milk, 
cereals and breadstuffs, gingerbread, potatoes, celerv, blanc- 
mange. Bavarian cream, whipped cream, and sponge cake. 
Wine or lemon jelly, junket, bread pudding, apple sauce, or- 
anges, ripe bananas, pineapple juice, prunes, cocoa, lemonade, 
orangeade. 



CHAPTER XIX 
DIET IN MISCELLANEOUS AFFECTIONS 

DIET IN NERVOUS DISORDERS 

Dietetic Treatment. The first thing to be done for a per- 
son suffering from nerve exhaustion is to adopt a dietary 
and a habit of life, that will rebuild the nerve cells. The 
lost energy must be gently and slowly " coaxed " back — not 
through medicines, but through proper environments, proper 
employment and proper food. There is no disease that re- 
quires so little medicine as nerve exhaustion. The dietary 
should be simple and nutritious, abounding in lettuc «, pars- 
ley and the fresh green edibles in season. If there is much 
intestinal disturbance, foods that are rich in starch should 
be discarded. Active stimulants should be entirely eschewed. 
Take freely of unfermented grape juice, malted milk and 
Sanatogen in milk or Vichy. 

In functional nervous disease, such as hysteria and hy- 
pochondriasis, the appetite, muscular elasticity, and mental 
powers will often be observed to be deficient in the early part 
of the day, and to recover their tone in the evening. At this 
latter time, therefore, it is advisable to make the principal 
meal. 

DIET IN SKIN DISEASES 

Xearly all affections of the skin of constitutional or reflex 
(gastro-intestinal) origin, especially acne, eczema, psoriasis, 
seborrhoea capitis, pruritus, urticaria, etc., improve under 
dietetic measures and often recover under these alone. 
While no special plan applies to all, the elimination of sugar 
and sweets of all kinds, and substances rich in fat, as cheese, 
nuts, fried articles, etc., is essential. Pure fats like butter, 
cream, salad oil, etc., are, however, well enough in small 

411 



412 DIET IN DISEASE 

amounts. Malt liquors and sweet wines disagree, lHrgel;y 
because of the sugar therein; but alcohol itself is also prej- 
udicial in many cases. 

It is well to take all food in small rations, and masticate 
it thoroughly; for the prejudicial effect of food in skin dis- 
eases is often directly attributable to fermentation, favored 
by atony of the digestive tract, dilated stomach, constipa- 
tion, etc. Physical exercise is of great benefit in most of 
these cases. 

The diet and other regimen in skin diseases is much like 
that for obesity, gout and diabetes. All these metabolic dis- 
orders tend to produce skin diseases.

DIETETIC MANAGEMENT OF SURGICAL CASES 

Not much special attention is paid to dietetics until a day 
or two before operation, with the exception of stomach cases. 
Whenever a patient is to be operated on for a stomach affec- 
tion, many surgeons advocate the free use of articles rich in 
vegetable acids, believing that such articles are natural anti- 
septics for the stomach and intestines. These substances, 
while technically acids, are quickly changed to alkalies in 
the body, and tend to lessen the total acidity of the latter. 
Some German surgeons even allow such patients to eat freely 
of sauerkraut, sour milk, etc. 

In other cases, the patient is placed in bed, or is in com- 
plete rest for several days, and fed on very simple and nutri- 
tious articles in moderate quantities only. The old custom 
of fattening or building patients up before operating on them 
has largely died out. If the bad general state of the patieut 



414 DIET IN DISEASE 

is due to the condition which is to be operated on, nothing 
is gained by such attempts. In the case of a rapidly pro- 
gressing disease, every hour lost before operating may dimin- 
ish the chance for recovery, immediate or ultimate. If the 
patient is in bad condition for withstanding an operation, he 
may often be operated on safely under local anesthesia. 
There are many resources to-day for minimizing the dangers 
of shock and hemorrhage. As a general rule the sooner a 
patient is operated on, the better, irrespective of the urgency 
of the condition. To live for weeks and months in anticipa- 
tion of an operation is believed by its depressing effect to off- 
set alleged attempts at strengthening patients. 

When a general anesthetic is to be given the patient must 
fast beforehand to such an extent that the stomach is empty 
at the hour of anesthesia. As operations are usually per- 
formed in the forenoon, the patient should take but little 
supper and no breakfast. Should the operation be performed 
late in the day, he may have a light breakfast. 

In emergency operations, the patient having taken food 
within six hours, the stomach should first be washed out. 
This is also done as a routine procedure in all operations 
involving the stomach itself. Water may be given at any 
time. After the operation there is such a natural tendency 
to nausea that little or no attempt should be made to feed 
the patient for some hours. Only in exceptional cases in 
which the stomach is not upset and the patient complains 
of hunger, a little tea and toast, or milk may be given. In 
the great majority of cases no food is given until the follow- 
ing day. 

As soon as the stomach will tolerate it, however, simple 
nutritious food should be given in proper amounts. The 
tendency to-day is toward getting np early after operations, 
and against everything which tends to make the patient pas- 
sive and bedfast. The patient therefore needs more food 
than if he were to be bedridden. 

In patients who from any reason are unconscious or de- 
lirious after operation, some plan of artificial treatment is 



MISCELLANEOUS AFFECTIONS 415 

necessary, involving the use of the nasal, stomach or rectal 
tube. 

In any condition in which post operative vomiting will 
undo the results of operation, the diet should be extremely 
light and bland until healing has occurred, and it may be 
necessary to feed by the rectum. If the patient is unable to 
masticate he must be given only liquid or very soft foods. 

As a rule, when post operative feeding is left wholly to 
the discretion of the nurse, a certain rule is adopted as fol- 
lows : 

Xo food at all for the first twenty-four hours. Water may 
be given in sips for the intolerable thirst and in addition to 
plain water, the patient may receive a swallow of carbonated 
water, cracked ice, a little hot tea or black coffee, or some 
alcoholic stimulant. Toward the end of the period a tea- 
spoonful or two of milk diluted with lime water may be 
given. 

During the second twenty-four-hour period about one-half 
a pint of milk or some other liquid food may be given in 
small doses and this amount may be doubled on the third 
day. 

The third or fourth day usually coincides with normal 
bowel action, the patient having received laxatives on the day 
preceding. The patient as soon as this has occurred may 
go upon a semi-solid diet, so increased as to be regular at 
the end of a week or ten days. 

The diet varies notably with the patient and the kind of 
operation and its outcome and the responsibility for special 
provisions suited to individual cases falls upon the medical 
attendant and are modified from day to day under his direc- 
tions. 

DIET AFTER LAPAROTOMY, OVARIOTOMY, ETC. 
Dr. Thompson i 

After all operations involving opening the peritoneal cav- 
ity complete rest of the stomach is necessary for at least four 

1 W. Oilman Thompson, M.D. : " Practical Dietetics." New York. I> 
Appleton & Co. 



416 DIET IN DISEASE 

or six hours, and not infrequently for two or three days. 
Food and stimulants may be given by enemata. If fed per os 
for the first three days, not over a tablespoonful of pancrea- 
tinised milk or milk with lime water or barely water should 
be allowed, once in two or three hours. Later the quantity 
may be increased and the intervals diminished, and beef tea, 
beef peptonoids, and egg albumin may be added. 

In these cases the duration of anesthesia has usually been 
prolonged, and the shock is considerable. The danger from 
the occurrence of vomiting, fermentation of food, and flatu- 
lent distention of the abdomen is far worse than that of in- 
anition from abstinence. It is well also to precede the opera- 
tion by a day or two of dieting in order to lessen the bulk 
of intestinal waste matter. To this end the diet should, 
when possible, consist chiefly of lean meat an^ dry toast, 
vegetables and especially sweets being avoided. 

After wounds and operations affecting the stomach or in- 
testines no food at all should be given by the mouth. Noth- 
ing but a little cracked ice should be so administered, and 
all nourishment must be supplied for several days by the 
rectum. The return to mouth-feeding must be made very 
slowly and cautiously by at first giving not over one or two 
tablespoonfuls of pancreatinised milk or beef juice at a time. 

There is often much thirst following operations involving 
the peritonaeum, which is relieved more by hot fluids than by 
ice, which sometimes irritates the throat and increases the 
desire for drink. If there is danger of all fluids exciting 
emesis, a salt-water enema once in three or four hours will

MOTHEKHOOD 

DIET TS PREGNANCY 

It is necessary to adopt a specific diet for pregnancy only 
when complications arise. If serious vomiting occurs in the 
early months, this disorder should be treated in the manner 
described in the following article. If albuminuria is discov- 
ered, meat and other nitrogenous food must be restricted in 
accordance with directions given for albuminuria. If the 
patient becomes anaemic, without albuminuria, milk, eggs 
and other iron-bearing foods should be eaten in abundance, 
particularly such vegetables as spinach and celery, and fruits 
including oranges and dates. In cases where constipation 
must be remedied, fruits, vegetables, and coarse cereals such 
as oatmeal and wheaten grits, will be of service. The " long- 
ing" of pregnant women for various indigestible articles 
such as pickles, chalk, etc., is largely mythical, and occurs, 
if at all, only as an accompaniment of a general hysterical 
condition, not as a peculiarity of the period of pregnancy. 

A few general rules for wise eating would certainly include 
the following: 

1. Let the diet always be simple and easy of digestion. 

2. Be sure that it furnishes abundant fuel value, since car- 
rying the unborn child increases the energy requirement of 
pregnant women about 10% over the normal. 

3. Include in the dietary foods high in calcium and phos- 
phorus; among the former are milk, orange juice, and such 
vegetables as celery, cauliflower, asparagus, lettuce, and 
spinach; among the latter, fish, lean beef, lettuce, spinach,

rutabagas, and parsnips. The skeletal lime supply nnil some- 
times the teeth of the pregnant woman are called upon to 
furnisli calcium for the unborn child, if the food does not 
supply enough lime. During periods of insufficient ])hos- 
phorus assimilation, there is also skeletal lime-waste. 

4. Never eat when tired, and do not overload the stomach. 

The diet as a whole, then, must be digestible, and suffi- 
ciently high in nourisliment and mineral content to keep the 
patient in good condition. 

DIET IN VOMITING — SEASICKNESS — VOMITING OF PREG- 
NANCY 
Thompson i 

The first principle in the dietetic treatment of vomiting 
from any cause is to give the stomach rest. If it has been 
overloaded with a large bulk of food, or with indigestible 
material, it is well to encourage emesis, and distressing retch- 
ing may be overcome by taking large draughts of lukewarm 
water. A quart or two will rinse out the stomach and allay 
irritation to a marked degree. 

Well nourished patients when serious vomiting first occurs 
should usually refrain from taking food of any kind for from 
ten or twelve or even twenty-four hours. Exceptions to this 
rule are sometimes found in that type of seasickness, and 
sometimes in the vomiting of pregnancy, in which, as soon 
almost as the stomach is emptied, there is a desire to replen- 
ish the loss. 

In any case in which the gastric irritation is persistent, 
it is necessary to give fluid food, and only in small oft-re- 
peated doses, preferably in predigested form. The food is 
best given cold, as a rule, although some persons can relieve 
nausea by sipping very hot water. 

A teaspoon of prepared milk, or in extreme cases but a 
few drops, given with a medicine dropper once in ten or fif- 
teen minutes, may be all that the stomach will at first toler- 
ate. 

The following is a list of dietetic substances which are

commonly prescribed for the relief of nausea and vomiting, 
or for nourishmeut while tliose conditions exist: Cracked 
ice; pancreatinised milk; milk with sodium bicarbonate (ten 
iira'ins), and cerium oxalate (five grains) ; milk and lime 
water ; Vichy or milk with Sanatogen ; milk and Vichy, soda, 
seltzer, or carbonic-acid water; kumyss and zoolak; beef ex- 
tracts ; raw meat pulp, scraped ; strong black coffee ; sour lem- 
onade or lemonade and Vichy ; clam broth. Dry crackers, dry 
toast, and ginger snaps will sometimes be retained in seasick- 
ness, or a cracker buttered and sprinkled Avith a little 
Cayenne pepper ; brandy and soda ; iced dry champagne ; iced 
brandy diluted with water, soda water, or carbonated water. 
Very severe and protracted cases may require lavage or 
nutrient enemata. Vomiting after abdominal surgical opera- 
tions is often controlled by lavage. 

DIET FOR THE MOTHER AFTER LABOR 

Immediatelv after labor in normal cases a milk diet is 
given for the 'first six hours ; at the end of that time, regular 
diet. The regular diet should include stewed fruits, and 
cereals given frequently ; eggs, vegetables which are easy of 
digestion, and very little meat — no veal nor pork. Plenty 
of milk should be supplied. 

In abnormal cases the diet is prescribed by the physician. 

In cases of severe engorgement of breasts, fluids are re- 
stricted; a ^xy diet is given, which consists of the regular 
diet, and one glass of milk with each meal : no tea nor coffee, 
and no fluid between meals. 

In cases of eclampsia milk is always given, and also a 
large quantity of water, either hot or cold, and cream of tartar 
drink. 

DIET OF A NURSING MOTHER OR WET NURSE 
Thompson i 

The diet of the nursing mother or wet nurse must be regu- 
lated to prevent noxious substances from passing into tlie 

1 W. Gilman Thompson, M.D.: •' Practical Dietetics." New York. D.

420 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

breast milk, and to keep her in good health, so that she does 
not suffer from constipation, indigestion, or anaemia. Her 
weight should not alter, and if she has menstruated once or 
twice the milk changes and may disagree. 

If milk does not make her constipated or bilious, she may 
drink it abundantly. Cream, cocoa, and chocolate are all 
valuable in the diet. She may take gruels and meat broths, 
and she should eat simple nourishing food, meat, eggs, veg- 
etables, and fruits. The latter, even if sour, do not react 
unfavorably upon the child, provided the mother's digestion 
is good, and they serve to keep the child's bowels active. A 
high supply of calcium is still necessary, for the mammary 
glands, during their activity, are a severe drain on the skeletal 
lime unless an abundance is offered for assimilation from 
the food. Accordingly the vegetables and fruits named be- 
fore are a necessar}^ addition to the diet. A liberal supply of 
iron is also very desirable. The iron of meat, occurring in 
the blood which is not very easily digested, is less available 
than the iron of eggs, vegetables, and fruits. The mother 
should forego the drinking of much tea and coffee. Beer 
and wine also should not be drunk unless they are especially 
prescribed as a tonic. Wet nurses often demand beer, ale, 
or porter with their meals if they have been accustomed 
to it; but the popular idea that such beverages are especially 
beneficial is fallacious. Malt liquor sometimes causes the 
secretion of more milk, because more fluid is drunk, but the 
milk is no better for it. A reasonable quantity of fluids 
should be drunk, however, or the secretion of milk will suffer. 
The fluid may be in the form of plain or effervescing water, 
milk, soups, etc. 

The mother or wet nurse should avoid all fatigue, worr\', 
and emotional excitement of any kind, which may inhibit her 
digestive functions, and should take daily outdoor exercise. 

On the whole, the best indication for the dietetic treatment 
of tlie wet nurse is the study of the condition of the child's 
digestion, bowels, and nutrition. A too meager diet for the 



MOTHERHOOD 421 

nurse is soon evident in lack of nutrition and development 
of the infant. 

Drugs in Human Milk. Not many drugs pass unchanged 
into tlie milk which are likely to poison the child through 
its food, but there are some which sliould be carefully avoided 
on this account. Such are belladonna, opium, morphine, and 
other alkaloids; iodin and its preparations; mercury and its 
salts; salicylic acid. 

When, for any reason, it becomes necessary to discontinue 
the nursing and to stop further secretion of milk, the diet 
should at once be made as dr}- as possible, and a minimum 
quantity only of fluid is allowed. 



CHAPTER XXI 
INFANT FEEDING 

PROCESS OF DIGESTION* 

In order to compreheud the principles which underlie the 
proper feeding of infants, it is well to understand what is 
involved in the process of digestion and what food elements 
are needed for the growth, maintenance, and repair of the 
body. 

Digestion is the process or series of processes by which the 
food eaten is changed into the forms in which it can be ab- 
sorbed by the tissues of the body. This is a most intricate 
operation, involving the use of many organs and functions, 
but one which takes place without difficulty in the healthy 
human body. But since all the complicated machinery neces- 
sary for digestion must be started at once, and since, neces- 
sarily, the organs of a newborn baby can be but feeble, it 
stands to reason that the food presented to him must be espe- 
cially adapted to his needs. This food must be liquid; it 
must also contain the five essential elements which the human 
body requires for maintenance and growth, namely, the fats, 
sugars and starches, which furnish the necessary fuel for 
energy; the proteins, or muscle-forming foods; the mineral 
salts needed for the growth of all tissues and regulation of 
body processes and, lastly, a great amount of water. All 
these are found in milk, and in no other food which the in- 
star (*) indicates quotations from "Infant Care" issued by the U S 
Department of Labor, Cliildren's Bureau, Washington, D. C. (Care of Chil- 
dren, Series No. 2. Bureau Publication No. 8.)

f ant is capable of digesting. Therefore milk is the one proper 
infant food. 

BEEAST FEEDING* 

The milk necessar}' for the normal healthy growth of every 
infant mammal, including the human species, is created for 
it in the breast of its mother. The milk of the cow, mare, 
ass, goat, and other animals has been analyzed by many in- 
vestigators, to see whether any one of them bears so close a 
resemblance to human milk that it may be used as a substi^ 
tute. All these investigations show that the milk of each 
animal is different from that of every other, and each is espe- 
ciallv adapted to the requirements of the young of that spe- 
cies. Xo other argument than this simple physiological one 
should be needed to induce a thoughtful mother to nurse her 
babv at the beginning of his life, but if further demonstra- 
tion is needed the evidence on every hand of the comparative 
failure of artificial feeding, at least as far as young babies 
are concerned, should be convincing.^ 'i 

Statistics gathered from this country and many others show 
that breast-fed babies have a much greater chance for life 
tlian those who are bottle fed, and also that the infant ill- 
nesses, not only those of the digestive tract but many other 
varieties, afflict bottle-fed infants much oftener and much 
more seriously than those who have breast milk. But not 
only does breast milk protect the nursing baby from illness 
and increase materially his chance for life, but it practically 
insures that his development shall proceed in a normal orderly 
fashion. 

The body makes a greater proportional growth during the 
first year of life than during any other, and the brain in- 
creases more in the same time than in all the rest of the 
vears of life put together. It is therefore of the utmost im- 
portance to the whole existence of each individual that during 
this most critical period the baby be surrounded with all the 
necessities for perfect health. The most important of these 

1 See Prenatal Care, pp. 32-35, for consideration of braast feeding •& af- 
fected by prenatal conditions. 



424 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

necessities is breast milk. Food is the one question of over- 
whelming importance to the baby. If the food is one to 
wliich the digestive apparatus must learn to accommodate 
itself, or one which is lacking in some of the elements neces- 
sary for growth and development, the natural processes are 
hindered, and if illness comes, they are seriously interfered 
with, sometimes to an extent which makes it difficult, if not 
impossible, for the baby entirely to regain the lost ground. 
To accustom the infant organs to do their work properly at 
this critical, formative time is essential to the health of the 
adult in no small degree. Undoubtedly in many cases grown 
people would have escaped many of the defects and deficiencies 
with which they have to contend if they had passed the period 
of infancy in perfect health. 

These are the impelling reasons why mothers should nurse 
their babies. Other less important reasons are that if the 
mother takes care of the baby herself it is much easier to 
nurse than to feed by a bottle ; that breast milk is practically 
free from disease germs, and that it is fed to the baby at a 
uniform temperature from beginning to end of the nursing. 

NURSING MOTHER* i 

The majority of mothers can nurse their babies, at least 
in part, if they have suitable care and advice. What is chiefly 
required is that this conviction should enter the mind of the 
mother and abide there ; for the fear that she will not be able 
to perform this function, or that the milk will not or does 
not agree with her child, has more to do with the supposed 
inability to nurse than any other one factor. The gland 
which secretes maternal milk is a wonderful and delicate 
mechanism. So intimate is the connection of the mammar}-- 
nerves with the mind that the mental states of the mother 
are readily reflected in their function. Fear, anger, or worry 
may serve to check the secretion of the milk, or to change 
its quality so much that, for the time being, it is unfit for 
use, while, on the other hand, a calm mind, joy, laughter, 

1 See Prenatal Care, pp. 32-35. 



INFANT FEEDING 425 

and idelight in life, coupled with the desire and intention to 
nurse the baby, will make it possible to do so. Failing this 
spirit, all other measures may prove futile. 

The secretion of milk is induced by the efforts of the baby 
to nurse, and therefore he should be put to the breast regu- 
larly for at least two weeks after birth, even if only a very 
little milk is secreted. This patient effort, with proper food 
and care, coupled with the determination to succeed, will 
usually result in a good supply of milk, and no physician or 
nurse who appreciates the value of breast milk for the baby 
will counsel another course. It is rarely true that the moth- 
er's milk does not agree with the baby. It is much more 
often deficient in quantity than in quality. The return of 
menstruation may lead to a slight temporary disturbance, but 
it is not a sufficient cause for weaning. 

Diet. A nursing mother should have a light, abundant, 
and appetizing diet, and such a one as causes her no indi- 
gestion. Disturbances in the digestive tract of the mother 
are quickly reflected in the baby's condition, and therefore 
the mother should refrain from eating or drinking those 
things which she knows from experience she can not digest. 
As a rule, indigestion in the mother, which shows itself in 
constipation, eructations of gas, headache, diarrhea, and the 
like, is caused by such foods as heavy puddings or underdone 
pastry; doughnuts; fried food soaked in fat; made dishes, 
such as croquettes and fritters; pickles, mincemeat, baked 
beans, pork and cabbage, and other heavy or poorly cooked 
foods; but people differ greatly in their power of digestion, 
and what will suit one person may upset the next. Overeat- 
ing may be a cause of indigestion. 

A mixed diet of such digestible and nutritious foods as are 
readily available is desirable for the nursing mother. All 
foods are milk-making foods. Emphasis should be laid on 
a high calcium and iron content for the diet; the former is 
necessary since the mammai-y glands, during their period of 
activity, are a severe drain on the skeletal lime unless a plen- 
tiful supply is present in the food offered for assimilation. 



I 



426 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

Accordingly such vegetables as celery, asparagus, carrots, let- 
tuce, radishes and spinach, and such fruits as oranges, grape 
fruit, dates, etc., besides plenty of milk, are necessary in tlie 
diet. A liberal amount of iron will be insured by the above 
list, provided eggs are added. In general the foods will in- 
clude vegetables easy of digestion, ripe fruits, poultry, beef, 
lamb, fish, with oysters and the like, eggs, milk, cheese, 
farinaceous foods (cereals, flour, meals, etc.), breads, espe- 
cially graham, whole wheat, corn meal, and bran, and simple 
desserts. Occasionally acid fruits, vegetables, and spices 
eaten by the mother may cause some disturbance in the baby, 
and in such cases they should be avoided. 

Constipation is to be most carefully avoided, by eating bran 
bread,^ vegetables in which the cellulose content is high, and 
other laxative foods. Drugs should be taken as little as pos- 
sible, and only on the doctor's advice. Tea and coffee may be 
taken in moderation, not more than one cup of each a day. 
Alcoholic drinks of all sorts are better avoided. One quart 
of milk should be taken each day. Six to eight glasses of 
good drinking water a day are required, one or two of which 
should be taken on rising to encourage the action of the bowels. 

Exercise. In order that a healthy nursing mother may be 
able to eat and digest a generous supply of food materials, 
exercise in the fresh air is indispensable. This must be un- 
dertaken gradually, so that the woman who is not apcustomed 
to exercise may not be overtired. A vigorous walk is one 
of the best of tonics, because of its effect both on the body 
and on the mind. Worries take flight when treated to sun- 
shine and fresh air and leave the nervous system free to 
perform its normal functions. The woman who has a garden 
to look after, or other interests which take her out of doors 
a good deal in the course of a day, gets her exercise in the 
most natural way, but she will need to be on guard against 
overtaxing herself. No exercise should be carried on to the 
point of weariness, because then the nutriment which should

INFAXT FEEDIXG 427 

go to make milk for the baby will be used to renew the moth- 
er's worn-out tissues. 

Sleep. An abundance of sleep is essential. The nursing 
mother should have at least eight hours of sleep every night, 
and an hour in the da}-time. A mother soon learns to rest 
herself whenever the baby nurses, and these brief periods of 
relaxation help greatly to keep her in good condition. 

Bathing.^ A daily bath is desirable, and should be taken 
whenever possible. It is especially important to remove the 
odors of perspiration or old milk from the mother's body and 
clothing, as tlie baby may refuse to nurse when an unpleasant 
odor is forced upon him. 

Amusements and Recreation. A conscientious young 
mother is veiy apt to defeat her own ends by staying at home 
too constantly and watching over her baby so incessantly that 
she grows pale and nervous and begins to worry, a condition 
wliich often results in depletion of the milk and correspond- 
ing disturbance in the baby. Healthy babies are better off 
Avith a judicious amount of " letting alone," and there is no 
reason why a mother should not be absent some part of every 
day, if there is a responsible person to be left in charge. Out- 
of-door life, pleasant recreation which is not exhausting, vis- 
iting, and other diversions are essential to every nursing 
mother if she is to keep up an abundant supply of milk. The 
family, especialh' the husband, should realize how important 
it is to shield the nursing mother from unnecessary work and 
worry, and to provide her at intervals with the opportunity 
for rest and recreation. However, a healthy mother should 
not regard herself nor permit her family to regard her as in 
any sense an invalid at this time. She is much more likely 
to succeed in nursing if she goes about her ordinary duties 
as usual and fills her life with normal interests. 

TECHNIftlTE OF NURSING* 

The first secretion of the breasts is called colostrum, and 
while not a true milk is adapted to the baby's needs in the 

1 See " Bathing," Prenatal Care, p. 13. 



428 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

first hours of his life. He should therefore be put to the 
breast as soon after birth as the mother is able to bear it. 
This early nursing is important to the mother because it helps 
to contract the uterus, and to the baby for various reasons, 
one of which is that he needs to learn how to draw his food 
before the breast fills M^th milk and becomes less pliant and 
more painful. 

The mother holds the baby on her arm, drawing him to tlie 
breast in such a way that his head is comfortably supported, 
turning slightly toward the side slie wishes to present and 
drawing the baby's feet and legs against her body. A pillow 
under the opposite shoulder is a welcome support. The baby 
should be able to grasp the nipple squarely. If his head is 
too low, the milk may flow back in his throat, making him 
cough and choke; but the head must be low enough so that 
the nostrils are not covered by the breast. It is impossible 
for the baby to suck properly unless he can breathe freely, 
and the mother should hold the breast away from his nostrils 
with the fingers of her free hand. When the breasts have 
filled, if the milk flows too fast, as sometimes happens, she 
may control the flow by taking the breast in her hand so that 
one finger is above and one below the nipple and b}' pressing 
it gently at the base. If the baby's efforts to nurse make the 
mothers nipples sore, they should be washed with plain boiled 
water or boric-acid solution before and after each nursinsr and 
may be anointed with lanolin at night, covering them with 
gauze or clean linen. If a crack should appear, the greatest 
care should be taken to prevent infecting the breast, as if this 
happens a painful breast abcess may result. A doctor should 
always be consulted. The cracked nipple should be kept con- 
stantly clean by washing it with boiled water. A glass nipple 
shield should be used, care being taken that it is always per- 
fectly clean and made sterile by boiling. The shield will not 
materially increase the difficulty of nursing for the baby and 
will safeguard the mother. If the breasts become engorged, 
they may be relieved by using a breast pump, if necessary, 
or by gentle massage; but all manipulation only serves to 



I 



INFANT FEEDING 429 

stimulate the breast to greater activit}- and the less handling 
it can have the better. Hot or cold applications, according 
to the patient's preference, are useful, and a breast binder 
is often a great relief, but should be applied by a physician 
or nurse.^ Usually the matter rights itself without difficulty 
as soon as the relation between the supply and demand is 
established. If the mother has received the proper care dur- 
ing pregnancy and the breasts and nipples have received due 
attention, which is part of a doctor's duty, the nursing period 
will be shorn of much of its pain and trouble. In general, 
the nipples should be kept as clean and as dry as possible 
and should be washed before each nursing. 

EEGULARITY IN NURSING* 

The baby should be nursed regularly, by the clock, from 
the very first and should have nothing between meals save 
water to drink. It takes from one and one-half to three 
hours for a baby's stomach to empty itself after a full meal 
of breast milk, and considerably longer for the process of 
digestion to be completed in the intestines. 

The baby should not ordinarily be allowed to remain at the 
breast over 20 minutes in any case, and the nipple should be 
withdrawn several times during the nursing, so that he Avill 
not take the food too rapidly with consequent regurgitation 
and indigestion. If the milk is plentiful, the breasts should 
be nursed alternately, but it may be necessary to give both 
breasts at one feeding, in order to satisfy the baby. Do not 
let the baby go to sleep while nursing. 

HOW OFTEN TO FEED* 

Most babies thrive better if the interval between feedings 
is fairly long. This interval may be six hours until the milk 
is established. From that time the baby may be fed at three- 
hour intervals until he is 4 months old, when four hours 
should be allowed to elapse between feedings. Many babies 
do well if fed only once in four hours from birth. However, 

1 See Prenatal Care for the treatment of engorged breasts. 



430 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

if the breast supply is scanty, more frequent stimulation is 
sometimes necessary to the success of breast feeding. 

Night feeding (after the 10 o'clock nursing) may be 
omitted when the child is 4 months old.

SUPPLEMENTARY FEEDING* 

There is apt to be a time, after the departure of the nurse, 
when the mother is just getting about her accustomed duties 
and is somewhat enfeebled and worried with the care of the 
baby, that the supply of milk decreases. It is at this or some 
other later period of stress that many babies are needlessly 
weaned. Instead, the baby should be put to breast with un- 
failing persistence at regular intervals, no matter how little 
he gets, since every mouthful of breast milk is important to 
him. It is the tendency of the breasts to cease to secrete 
milk when suction is discontinued, and it is essential to a 
continuance of the supply that it be constantly drawn upon. 
The mother should be encouraged to eat more nourishing 
food, such as milk, cream, eggs, meat, and good bread, and 
to take a larger amount of fluid food. Raw eggs beaten up 
and added to milk agree well with many persons. Even if 
the amount of milk diminishes until the baby gets little or 
none, it may often be reestablished by patient and constant 
effort, provided the mother does not wottj, but rather strives 
in every way to build herself up by good food, out-of-door 
life, and pleasant surroundings, in all of which she should

INFANT FEEDING 431 

have the help of her family. Meanwhile the baby must be 
given additional food. 

WHAT TO FEED* 

This supplementary food should be cows' milk, adapted to 
the age of the infant, given by bottle, using a nipple with a 
very small hole lest the baby, finding it easier to nurse the 
bottle, will not suckle the breast with sufficient vigor to give 
it the required stimulation. 

HOW MUCH TO FEED* 

In order to determine how much breast milk he is getting, 
and therefore how much supplementary food is needed, the 
baby should be weighed, without making any change in the 
clothing, before and after each nursing in 24 hours and the 
results carefully set down. At the end of this period it will 
be possible, by adding the various amounts together, to see 
exactly how much milk the baby has had and from this to 
determine to what extent the mother's milk needs to be sup- 
plemented. In this situation the help and care of a good 
doctor are especially needed. 

The scales should be similar to grocer's scales, having a 
pan or basket in which to lay the baby, and should weigh 
to one-half ounce. Spring scales are not sufficiently accurate 
for this purpose. 

CAPACITY OF BABY'S STOMACH 

Newly born a)x)ut 1 ounce. 

At 1 month about 2i ounces. 

At 2 months about 31 ounces. 

from then on, up to the first six months, the gain is only 
fractional, so that at that time it is barely four ounces. 

One should bear in mind that the baby often craves water, 
rather than milk, and should always be offered it at intervals. 
It takes in this way one and one-half ounces or more eacli 
day, usually at the rate of two teaspoonfuls every four hours. 
This use of water tends to prevent overfeeding. It is a good 



432 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

plan to give the water in a nursing bottle, as in this way the 
child becomes accustomed to its use, and less difficulty is 
experienced at weaning time, or when breast feeding has to 
be partially or wholly discontinued for any reason. 

WEIGHT* 

In order to determine how the baby is thriving, it is neces- 
sary to weigh him at stated intervals and compare the results. 
The average baby weighs about 7 pounds at birth, boys being 
slightly heavier than girls. A healthy baby may weigh as 
little as 5 or 6 pounds and as much as 10 or 12 pounds, but 
these weights are unusual. A slight falling off in weight 
occurs during the first few days or the first week of life, 
amounting to a few ounces or as much as a pound, but this 
loss is promptly regained in from 4 to 10 days, and from 
that time the baby should show a constant gain in weight. 
During the first month the daily gain should average about 
three-fourths of an ounce ; at 7 months, about one-half ounce 
a day; and at 1 year, one-fourth of an ounce a day. The 
average baby gains about I14 pounds a month for the first 
six months and one pound a month from that time to the 
end of the first year, doubles its weight at about 5 or 6 
months, and trebles it at the end of the first year. A dimin- 
ishing weight demands careful attention. If there is a loss 
in weight, and especially if it is accompanied with other 
symptoms of illness, a good doctor should be consulted at 
once. If these conditions occur in the heat of summer, the 
physician will make any change in the diet with very great 
caution, taking pains not to increase the food to the extent 
of producing diarrhea. 

A very rapid increase in weight is not to be desired. The 
ideal in baby feeding is not to produce a fat baby, but rather 
a proportionately nourished one. It is comparatively easy 
to grow fat, but it is a harder and slower process to grow 
muscle, bone, blood, and nerve tissue. The majority of moth- 
ers feel that if they have a fat, red-cheeked baby it is evi- 
dence they are giving the best sort of care, but this is not 



INFANT FEEDING 433 

always true. Some of the well-advertised infant foods pro- 
duce just this kind of bahies, but the later development shows 
that the food was deficient in some of the important elements 
needed for the symmetrical development of all parts of the 
body, and weakness of some part or some later deficiency of 
health may be the first indication that such babies were not 
properly fed. A perfect baby does not have the outlines of 
his muscles obliterated by wads and cushions of fat. He is 
alert, springy. The flesh is hard to pressure, not soft and 
flabby. His color is pinkish, save when the cheeks have been 
reddened by the cold or heat. A leading English authority 
on infant care declares that in his opinion " it is practically 
impossible for any infant to put on more than 6 or 8 ounces 
of good nitrogenous tissue in one week, and very few can 
put on as much." ^ Bottle-fed babies should be watched with 
particular care as to their weight in summer. It is better to 
have little or no gain during the excessive heat than to upset 
the digestion by overfeeding designed to keep the baby gain- 
ing. 

HOW TO WEIGH THE BABY* 

Undress the baby completely. Put a soft cloth in the pan 
of the scales, and lay the baby on it ; or wrap the baby in a 
blanket, if the room is not warm. Weigh carefully and write 
down the result. Remove the baby, weigh the blanket or 
cloth, and subtract this amount from the first weight. 

When weighing the baby before and after nursings to de- 
termine the amount of breast milk he is receiving, do not un- 
dress him, but weigh both times in exactly the same clothing. 
If the diaper becomes wet or soiled meantime, do not change 
it until after the weight has been taken. 

ARTIFICIAL FEEDING* 

The term "artificial feeding" refers, in common accept- 
ance, to the method of feeding which must be employed when 
a baby is, for any reason, denied breast milk, because any

434 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

other method of feeding a young baby than at its mother's 
breast is truly artificial. 

DIFFERENCE IN COMPOSITION BETWEEN HUMAN 
AND COW'S MILK 
Cow's milk has a larger protein content than human milk, 
and is richer in mineral matter. Human milk has a larger 
sugar content and therefore a somewhat sweeter taste. The 
fat content of the two kinds of milk is about the same, and 
this is also true of the total solids. The following table shows 
the average composition of the two kinds of milk : 

Human Cow's 

Water 87% 87% 

Total solids 13% 13% 

Fatty matter 4% 4% 

Lactose 7% 5% 

Protein (see second table) 1.5% 3.3% 

Mineral matter 0.2% 0.7% 

The fat of cow's milk differs with the breed of milch cow, 
and may be as low as 2 per cent, or 3 per cent. The fat in 
human milk is quite constant in amount, but the protein 
content may vary from 1 per cent, to 3 per cent., the 1.5 per 
cent, in the table being an average. 

Human milk, in comparison with cow's milk, is very poor 
in casein, but rich in lactalbumin and hence, when coagulated, 
does not form large curds like cow's milk. The relations 
between casein and lactalbumin in the two kinds of milk are 
shown in the following table: 

Human Cow's 

Total protein 1.50 3.30 

Casein 50 3.00 

Lactalbumin 1.00 .50 

The high protein content and large proportion of casein 
in cow's milk are advantageous to the calf, with its rapid 
rate of growth, and complex system of stomachs in which 
large curds can be completely digested; but for the more 
slowly growing baby, whose digestion is largely intestinal, 



INFANT FEEDING 435 

tlie proportion of protein and the character of the curd must 
be modified. The fat of mother's milk contains more olein 
and more phosphorized fat (lecithin) than cow's milk. The 
lactose is chemically the same. Freshly drawn cow's milk is 
neutral or amphoteric in reaction to litmus. Basic elements 
predominate in both cow's and human milk, and hence they 
are both technically alkaline. The acidity of cow's milk to 
oertain indicators is due to the presence of acid salts, such as 
acid calcium phosphate. 

On standing, true acid is formed by the action of lactic 
acid bacteria upon the lactose. For this reason, cow's milk 
frequently reacts acid to litmus. Breast milk is practically 
»terile. 

MILK* 

Wide experience has shown that fresh cows' milk is the 
best substitute for breast milk. This milk should be the 
purest and cleanest possible; it should be the product of a 
tuberculin-tested herd, one that is healthy, well fed, properly 
boused and cared for, and milked by clean milkers into steril- 
ized utensils. The milk should be bottled and cooled at the 
dairy and delivered to the consumer in sealed bottles. The 
milk commonl}^ sold from open cans, knoA^Ti as " loose " or 
" dipped " milk, should never be given to a baby. 

Certified Milk. In certain places it is possible to obtain 
what is known as " certified " milk, which is fresh, clean, pure, 
normal milk of uniform composition and highest quality 
obtained from healthy cows and produced and handled under 
the supervision of a medical milk commission, with special 
sanitary precautions. Although the amount of certified milk 
is as yet far too small, the demand for it is steadily increasing. 
As soon as mothers become convinced of the infinite advan- 
tage of having a supply of raw milk whose quality is guaran- 
teed, they are quite ready to pay the additional cost. This 
milk averages to cost about 16 cents a quart; but compared 
with the cost of the illness due to the use of unclean milk, 
this is not to be considered. There can be no doubt *hat the 



436 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

use of certified milk has been a great factor in the reduction 
of deaths from infantile diarrhea in recent years. The Amer- 
ican Association of Milk Commissions publishes literature 
on the subject. The secretary may be addressed at the Ortz 
Building, Cincinnati, Ohio. 

Heating c»- Cool-ing Milk. "Wlien certified milk can not be 
had, or some other milk known to be clean, it is safer to heat 
that which is used. Bad milk may look clean and may taste 
and smell sweet, since disease germs do not reveal their pres- 
ence by the ordinary tests. It is very difficult to insure the 
cleanliness of the general milk supply, and since it seems 
impossible to be certain that the milk is always perfectly 
clean, it is necessary to kill these germs by some process 
of heating before using the milk for young babies, or for any 
babies, in the heat of summer. These processes, however, do 
not make good milk out of bad, nor clean milk out of that 
which is dirty; they merely make a poor thing a little less 
dangerous, and emphasize the necessity for raising the stand- 
ard of local milk production. 

Breed of Coivs. Authorities recommend the herd milk of 
Holstein or ordinary grade cows for infant feeding, as such 
milk has a more nearly proper percentage of fat than others. 
If one is obliged to use milk having a high percentage of fat, 
such as that from Jersey or Guernsey cows, some part of the 
fat should be removed before making up the feedings.^ 

Care of the Milk. One of the reasons why cows' milk is 
not always a safe food is that it is very readily infected with 
germs, some of which may make the baby sick. These germs 
multiply with astonishing rapidity when the milk is allowed 
to stand for any length of time at a moderate temperature, 
but do not flourish if the milk is kept very cold. The milk 
should never be left standing on the doorstep in the sun, nor 
in a warm kitchen, but should be put in the ice box as soon 
as it is delivered. It must be kept covered, protected from 
dust and flies, not left standing in shallow, open pans nor put

No. 56. Wash. D. C. 



INFANT FEEDING 437 

into the refrigerator in pitchers or open dishes, as it is very 
readily contaminated by other foods. Milk should be Jcept in 
glass jars or bottles which are made sterile by boiling before 
being filled. If the milk is sour, or shows a sediment in the 
bottom of the bottle, it is not fit to give to the baby. 

A Homemade Ice Box. An ice box to keep the baby's 
feedings cold for 24 hours, can be made at home for very 
small cost, as follows : Procure a wooden box about 18 inches 
square, the same depth ; put a layer of sawdust 3 inches thick 
in the bottom of the box; fill in with sawdust around a 10- 
quart tin pail or a section of 10-inch galvanized pipe which 
occupies the middle of the box. Inside this pail or pipe 
place another slightly smaller pail, which is to hold the ice 
and the bottles. This inner pail should be covered, and the 
outer box tightly closed by a wooden cover lined with several 
thicknesses of newspaper. The inner pail should be taken 
out each morning to be emptied and cleaned. This little 
device will keep cool with 5 cents' worth of ice for 24 hours 
or even longer. AYhen feeding time comes, the box is opened, 
one bottle is taken out, and the box is quickly closed again. 

HOW TO FEED THE BABY 

WHAT TO FEED* 

Leading authorities differ so widely on various points con- 
nected with this subject that no directions can be given which 
will meet with general agreement. A few of the fundamental 
points are given here, but whenever possible the mother should 
confer with a good doctor regarding an artificially fed infant. 

The only proper artificial food is cows' milk, suitably mod- 
ified to suit the child's age and development. Dry milk con- 
taining 12% of butter fat is a good modification. Some 
babies have peculiarities, and with them rules can not be 
closely followed ; but with most, if proper rules are followed 
from the outset, there will be comparatively little trouble. 
The advice of a good doctor should be sought and followed. 
It is most unwise for the mother to experiment with difl^erent 
foods or different mixtures, or to try to feed her baby by the 
advice of her neighbors. 



438 DIET IX SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MILK MODIFICATIONS 

It must be constantly borne in mind that anything but 
mother's milk is a foreign substance in the stomach of the 
child, and even to make a mixture agreeing in chemical com- 
position with the natural food is not to insure success. The 
general principles must be applied in a special way to each 
individual case. 

The first step in modification is the dilution of the protein. 
Few new-born infants can digest pure cow's milk. Some 
require more dilution than others. "Where the digestive pow- 
ers are unknown, it is wise to begin with a low strength 
and advance as rapidly as the condition of the child will per- 
mit. From 14 to 1 per cent, protein is commonly recom- 
mended for the early weeks. 

The second step is the adjustment of the fat. Individual 
infants differ in their tolerance of fat as of protein. But 
inasmuch as the chemical and physical differences are not as 
great in the case of fat, it is usually not necessary to reduce 
it below 2 per cent., and it should approximate the proportion 
in mother's milk as rapidly as possible. 

When whole milk is diluted, if more than one volume of 
water be added, the percentage of fat is less than two, and 
for greater fat content, fat must be added in the form of 
cream. Since it is difficult to get the right percentage in 
this way, it is customary to select a milk with such a ratio 
between the protein and fat that diluting one to the desired 
strength dilutes the other also to the required degree and is 
known as the Top Milk Method. This is accomplished by 
taking the upper layers of milk which has been standing 
five hours or more for the cream to rise. The upper lay- 
ers have much fat and little protein; the lower, much pro- 
tein and little fat, and the adjustment is readily made by 
taking a certain number of ounces for dilution. In the 
laboratory, the exact fat and protein content can be deter- 
mined by direct analysis. 

The third step in modification is the adjustment of the 



INFANT FEEDING 43!) 

milk sugar. This can usually be given of the full strength 
found in mother's milk (7 per cent.). Since lactose com- 
mercially prepared from cow's milk is of the same composi- 
tion as that in mother's milk, it is only necessary to know 
the percentage already present in the mixture to be fed, and 
then add sufficient to make the desired strength. 

Besides these three main steps in artificial feeding, we may 
liave as a further consideration the selection of a diluent. 
Water is the first choice, but to aid in the modification of 
the character of the curd, cereal waters or gruels, lime water, 
proprietary foods, etc., are sometimes prescribed. Carefully 
prepared, and regarded mainly as dilutents and not as sub- 
stitutes for milk, the cereals and prepared foods are often 
useful aids. Lime water causes the casein of the milk to 
swell, and tends to send the curd in soft condition into the 
intestines. It is also beneficial as a corrective of constipa- 
tion. 

THE CHARACTER OF THE MILK MAY BE ALTERED, 
CHEMICALLY 

1. It may be predigested, in which case there is no casein 
to curdle. 

" Peptonisation " is accomplished by the use of commer- 
cial trypsin (pancreatic extract, and sodium bicarbonate). 
Put the mixture into milk at body temperature 32° C. Heat 
for approximately two hours, and arrest the process at the 
partial peptonisation stage since peptonised milk is bitter. 
This modification relieves the stomach of practically all its 
work, but should be made use of for short periods only. 

2. Sodium bicarbonate can be used. Sodium citrate is 
available for the same purpose. Milk of magnesia also 
changes the acidity of the stomach. 

3. '* Protein milk " for emergency cases, is made in the 
following way : A quart of fresh milk is curdled with rennet, 
using cne junket tablet for the quart. Keep the milk at body 
temperature for half an hour; then filter through cheese 
cloth, and discard the whey. Mix the curd with a pint of 



440 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

water; beat, and rub through a very fine sieve two or three 
times. Finally add a pint of buttermilk. This preparation 
has a fuel value of 350 calories to the quart, and the per- 
centage composition is as follows: 

Protein, 3%. Fat, 2yo%. Carbohydrate, 11/2%. Ash, yo%. 
WHAT DILUTION TO USE 

The degree of dilution varies witli the age of the child. 
Advance is made from low strength to higher as rapidly as 
the child is able to digest stronger food. Since it is usually 
necessary to begin with a formula weaker than mother's milk, 
it is desirable that stronger formulae be given as soon as 
practicable to compensate for this early loss. This is partic- 
ularly true as regards mineral constituents. On diluted 
cow's milk, the child gets less iron and phosphorus than in 
mother's milk, and while cow's milk is rich in calcium, it is 
doubtful whether this is as perfectly utilized as that in human 
milk. 

Whenever there are signs of indigestion, such as vomiting 
or frequent loose stools, the mother should dilute the food, 
or omit it altogether, giving nothing but a little plain boiled 
water until the doctor sees the baby. 

MODIFIED WHOLE MILK 

The following directions for feeding the baby modified 
whole milk have been prepared by a committee of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association.^ 

Beginning on the third day, the average baby should be given 3 
ounces of milk daily, diluted with 7 ounces of water. To this should 
be added I tablespoonful of limo water and 2 level teaspoonfuls of 
sugar. This should be given in seven feedings. 

At 1 week the average child requires 5 ounces of milk daily, which 
should be diluted with 10 ounces of water. To this should be added 
11/^ even tablespoonfuls of sugar and 1 ounce of lime water. This

Committee on Public Health Education Among Women, by Drs. L. Emmett Holt 
and Henry L. K. Shaw. Council on Health and Public Instruction, American 
Medical Association. 



INFANT FEEDING 441 

should be given in seven feedings. The milk should be increased by 
one-half ounce about every four days. The water should be increased 
by one-half ounce every eight days. 

" At 3 months the average child requires 16 ounces of milk daily, 
which should be diluted with 16 ounces of water. To this should 
be added 3 tablespoonfuls of sugar and 2 ounces of lime water. This 
should be given in six feedings. The milk should be increased by 
one-half ounce every six days. The water should be reduced by one- 
half ounce about every two weeks. 

At 6 months the average child requires 24 ounces of milk daily, 
which sliould be diluted with 12 ounces of water. To this should be 
added 2 ounces of lime water and 3 even tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
This should be given in five feedings. The amount of milk should 
be increased by one-half ounce every week. The milk should be 
increased only if the child is hungry and digesting his food well. It 
should not be increased unless he is hungry, nor if he is suffering 
from indigestion even though he seems hungry. 

At 9 months the average child requires 30 ounces of milk daily, 
which should be diluted with 10 ounces of water. To this should be 
added 2 even tablespoonfuls of sugar and 2 ounces of lime water. This 
sliould be given in five feedings. The sugar added may be milk sugar 
or if this cannot be obtained cane (granulated) sugar or maltose 
(malt sugar). At first plain water should be used to dilute the milk. 

At 3 months, sometimes earlier, a weak barley water may be used 
in the place of plain water; it is made of one-half level tablespoonful 
of barley flour to 16 ounces of water and cooked for 20 minutes. 

At 6 months the barley flour may be increased to 1^ even table- 
spoonfuls cooked in the 12 ounces of water. 

At 9 months the barley flour may be increased to 3 level tablespoon- 
fuls cooked in the 8 ounce? of water. 

Sugar is added to the food not to sweeten it but to furnish 
a necessary foodstuff. Ordinarily it is much better to avoid 
using it. Physicians differ as to the best sugar for use in in- 
fant feeding. ;Malt sugar gives very good results, and several 
preparations which contain dextrin as well as maltose are 
on the market, but are expensive. Milk sugar is also expen- 
sive, and some physicians believe that it has a greater tendency 
to upset the baby. Cane sugar is the cheapest form of sugar, 
and many babies seem to digest it very well. One objection 
to the use of cane sugar is that the baby quickly becomes 
accustomed to the sweet taste, making it difficult later to 
induce him to eat unsweetened foods.

The top milk method has been greatly simplified by Dr. 
Holt and the following suggestions will be helpful in apply- 
ing it : 

"Milk bottled at dairies should be allowed to stand after 
it is received for at least two hours before removing the top- 
milk. This may be done with a siphon, spoon or small, 
special dipper; pouring off is not accurate. 

It is unnecessary in practice to have a top-milk which 
contains more than 7 per cent, fat; while it is desirable at 
times to obtain milk which is practically fat-free. It is also 
desirable to know the percentage of fat that is obtained when 
one uses various quantities from the top or bottom of a quart 
of milk. These values are only approximate, but if the top- 
milk is carefully removed, are sufficiently accurate for practi- 
cal purposes. These may be obtained from average herd 
milk or very rich milk as given on page 444 (from 4% and 
5% milk).

FORMULAS FROM WHOLE (4 PER CENT) MILK 

Giving Approximate Percentage Composition and Caloric Value 
Per Ounce 

Dr. L. Emmett Holt 

Two sets of formulas are used of which the second differs 
from the first in having a larger fat percentage. The first 
set is given in full. Note table I Page 443. 

The second formula is sometimes substituted for the first, 
after the first few weeks. The upper half of a quart bottle 
of milk, i.e. a 7 per cent, top-milk is substituted for whole 
milk. The child receives from a third to a fourth less milk 
than in the first formula. The second formula may be used 
up to the seventh or eighth month, when the child returns to 
whole milk with gruel addition. The second formula may be 
used by any child who can assimulate the increased fat per- 
centage. The top-milk formula should never be used for 
cliildren who vomit or those with weak digestion. 

TOP MILK MODIFICATION 

The following table from Dr. Holt's book shows the amount 
of food required by the average healthy baby at the given

The interval is reckoned from the beginning of one feeding 
to the beginning of the next. Large children with strong 
digestion may take the larger quantities, while -small or weak 
infants should take the smaller amounts. If the baby either 
habitually- regurgitates his food or leaves some milk in the 
bottle each time, the interval between feedings .should be in- 
creased. 

SIMPLE METHOD OF CALCULATING A MILK FORMITLA ON A 
BASIS OF CALORIC REaTJIREMENTS 

Dr. L. Emmett Holt 

This is based on the experience that an average healthy 
child requires about ly^ oz. milk for each pound of bodv- 
weight. An infant weighing 10 pounds therefore requires 
15 oz. of milk in 24 hours. Its caloric requirements are 45 to 
the pound or 450 for a 10 lb. child. The milk alone supplies 
20 calories per oz. or 300 in all. To secure the additional 150 
fat, sugar or starch must be added. One ounce of sugar gives 
120 calories; 1^4 oz. gives 150. The amount of diluent (wa- 
ter, etc. ) to be added is calculated from the liquid requirement 



446 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

Avhich is 3 oz. per pound for the early and 2 oz. for the later 
months. Thus if a 10 lb. child requires 30 oz. of fluid daily, 
15 oz. of water will have to be added to the 15 oz. of milk. 
The formula will therefore be as follows for a 10 lb. child: 

Milk 15 oz. 300 calories 

Sugar ly* oz. 150 " 

Water 15 oz. 

Total 30 oz. 450 calories 

The 30 ounces should be taken in 7 feedings of 4^4 o^- eacK 
or in 6 feedings of 5 oz. each.

PREPARATION OF THE FOOD* 
Home Modification 

Everytliing that is to be used in the preparation of the 
baby's food, including the hands and clothing of the mother 
01 nurse, must be absolutely clean. To clean the utensils 
they should be boiled in the large kettle for 15 minutes just 
before using. 

Utensils. Enameled ware or aluminum utensils are tlie 
safest kind to use, since they are most readily kept clean. 
They should be used exclusively for this purpose. The fol- 
lowing articles will be found convenient : 

As many nursing bottles as there are feedings in one day. 

A nipple for each bottle. 

A new clean cork stopper for each bottle or rubber cover. 

A bottle brush. 

^ graduated measuring glass. 

A 2-quart pitcher. 



INFANT FEEDING 447 

A long-haDdled spoon for stirring the food. A pail or ket- 
tle for pasteurizing the milk and sterilizing the utensils. A 
fork. A tablespoon. A double boiler for cooking cereals. 
A clinical thermometer. A bath thermometer. The frame 
being wood, which permits the thermometer to float. A milk 
thermometer. 

Bottles. The best nursing bottle is the one which affords 
the least harbor for germs. An 8-ounce cylindrical bottle 
having the scale in ounces blown in the side is most con- 
venient, as it fits readily into the ice box and the pasteurizer. 
Nursing bottles with a small long neck are difficult to clean 
and require a brush, which must also be kept ckan. If the 
neck is short, sloping gradually into the shoulder the construc- 
tion is better than bottles with long necks, or abrupt shoulder. 
Xursing bottles have influence on baby mortality; therefore, 
mothers should use the nursing bottle which is safest for the 
baby. 

CARE OF BOTTLES* 

Xew bottles should be annealed by placing them on the 
stove in a dishpan of cold water and leaving them to boil for 
20 minutes. Allow them to stay in the water until it is cold. 
Bottles thus treated will not readily break when filled with 
boiling water or when the food is being cooked in them. 

Each bottle should be emptied as soon as the baby has fin- 
ished nursing, then rinsed with cold water and left standing, 
filled with water, until the bottles for one day's feedings have 
all been used. At a convenient time, scrub all the bottles 
with hot soapsuds, using the bottle brush over every part of 
the inside. Then rinse them thoroughly through several 
waters and put them in a kettle of water over the fire. When 
the water has boiled for 15 minutes the bottles will be steril- 
ized. 

Nipples. A conical nipple ^ is best, since it can be readily 
turned inside out to be cleaned. Nipples attached to long 
rubber tubes should never be used, as it is impossible to clean 



448 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

them. They are so dangerous to infant health and life that 
the sale of them ought to be prohibited by law. The hole in 
the nipple should be just large enough so that when the filled 
bottle is held upside down the milk drops rapidly. If the hole 
is large enough so that the milk runs in a stream, the baby 
will take his food too fast. 

Care of Nipples. Nipples need special care. If allowed 
to soak in water when not in use the rubber quickly becomes 
spongy and disintegrates, the hole grows larger and larger, 
and the nipple is soon unfit for use. 

Immediately after the feeding remove the nipple and rinse 
with cold or warm (not hot) water. Eub the outside with 
a little common salt to remove the milk, turn the nipple in- 
side out, rinse, and rub with salt; rinse again and boil for 
five minutes. The nipple will dry at once when removed 
from the boiling water. Place in a dry glass jar which has 
been boiled and screw the cover on tight. Keep from the 
light and rinse again in boiled water just before using. 

It is wise always to have extra nipples prepared, as they 
are subject to many accidents. 

How to Prepare the Feedings. Take the milk bottle out 
of the ice box, rinse with boiled water, and wipe the top with 
a clean towel. Next remove the paper cap with the fork 
which has just been boiled. Tben pour out enough milk for 
the day's feedings, measuring the amount in tlie glass grad- 
uate, and empty it into the pitcher. Measure the required 
amount of water (using cold boiled water) in the same way 
and add to the milk. Measure the sugar and lime water ; add 
these to the milk and water and stir well. Then take as 
many bottles as there are to be feedings in 24 hours, and fill 
them exactly to the proper depth according to the scale blown 
in the bottle. If the materials have been carefully measured, 
the bottles will be filled to equal depth. Close with new, 
clean bottle corks in preference to wads of cotton,^ and pas- 



INFANT FEEDING 449 

teurize or sterilize the feedings thus prepared in accordance 
with directions that follow. 

Pasteurizing. This process consists in heating the milk 
to 145 degrees, holding it there for some time (20 to 30 min- 
utes), and then cooling it rapidly to 50 degrees. The use 
of one of the excellent pasteurizers and sterilizers in the 
market greatly simplifies this part of the work, but satis- 
factory results can be attained by the use of an ordinary pail 
or kettle. A convenient method for home pasteurizing is as 
follows : 

Put a gallon (4 quarts) of water on the stove in a kettle. 
When the water is boiling hard, remove the kettle from the 
stove to a table and allow it to stand uncovered for 10 min- 
utes; then put the filled and loosely corked bottles into the 
water, cover the kettle, and allow it to stand covered for half 
an hour. At the end of this time remove the bottles, cool 
rapidly under running water, and put in the ice box until 
needed. Do not uncork the bottle from the time it is first 
closed until the baby is to be fed. 

Boiling. Fill the bottles and stand them in a kettle of 
water over the fire. When the water has boiled three-quarters 
of an hour the milk will have been sufficiently heated; or, 
when more convenient, the milk may be simply boiled in a 
clean saucepan for three minutes, poured into sterilized bot- 
tles, and then cooled rapidly in running water. 

Xote: It is well to put a wooden rack at the bottom of 
the receptacle in which nursing bottles are placed. This 
will protect the bottles from contact with the iron receptacle, 
or tin, whatever is used, and prevent breakage. 

HOW TO GIVE THE BABY THE BOTTLE * 

When it is time to feed the baby take the cold bottle from 
the ice; do not pour out the milk, but place the bottle, still 
corked, in a vessel of warm water, having the water cover 
the bottle above the milk line, and allow the water to heat. 
Do not allow the water to boil, as that will make the milk 



450 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

too hot. To test the temperature of the milk, open the bot- 
tle and drop a little milk on the inner surface of the arm. 
If it feels comfortably warm to the mother's skin it will be 
right for the baby. If it has been made too hot, cool the 
bottle under running water. The mother should never put 
the nipple in her own mouth to test the temperature of the 
milk, as an infection, such as a " cold," might easily be con- 
veyed in this way from mother to baby. Put on one of the 
sterile nipples from the Jar. Handle the nipple only by the 
neck, and do not touch the part which is to go into the baby's 
mouth. 

Hold the baby on the left arm in the same position as for 
breast feeding. The bottle should be held by the mother 
or nurse throughout the feeding. It must be presented to 
the baby at such an angle that the neck of the bottle is kept 
continually filled and the baby is able to grasp the nipple 
squarely. The feeding should be finished in 20 minutes. If 
the baby eats greedily, withdraw the nipple for a moment 
several times during the feeding. If he is sleepy, keep him 
awake until the bottle is finished. If, in spite of this, he 
falls asleep, remove the bottle and do not give another until 
the next feeding time. Babies like to nurse a little, then 
sleep a little, then take the bottle again ; but this should not 
be allowed, as it unduly prolongs the feeding. 

NORMAL FEEDING* 

If the baby has been breast fed for a while and is then put 
on cows' milk, it is wise, until he has become somewhat 
accustomed to the new food, to use a weaker mixture at first 
than the one indicated for that age. The food can be 
strengthened every few days if necessary until it suits his 
age. If the baby shows any signs of disturbed digestion it 
is wise to return at once to the weaker food until he is quite 
well again ; if he seems satisfied, is gaining from 4 to 6 ounces 
a week, does not vomit, and has normal stools, it is reason- 
ably certain that the food is of the right strength and quan- 
titv. 



INFANT FEEDING 451 

UNDERFEEDING * 

As a rule, babies are overfed rather than underfed. But 
if the baby cries as soon as the bottle is taken away, and 
again before the next feeding time, a careful increase may 
be made day by day toward a stronger mixture, stopping at 
a point where he is satisfied. 

OVERFEEDING * 
If the baby sleeps restlessly, vomits his food, or has loose 
bowel movements, it usually indicates that he is being fed 
too much, too often, or that his food is stronger than he can 
digest. If the baby is breast fed, the interval between nurs- 
ings should be lengthened to 4 hours, as a first measure. It 
is wise to see the doctor, when possible. For bottle-fed babies 
the amount of the day's feeding may be decreased by usinf? 
one-half of the usual contents of each bottle until the dis 
turbance has subsided. 

DRINKING WATER * 

The baby needs plenty of cool, unsweetened water to drink. 
It is safe to boil all the drinking water for a baby, which 
should be given to a young baby lukewarm, never ice cold. 
K'ever put sugar or anything else in it. Offer it to the baby 
between feedings; in summer especially he needs to drink 
frequently. A " runabout " baby is constantly exercising 
while awake and requires a great deal of water. Fretful 
babies, especially those who are cutting teeth, are often quieted 
by a cool drink. 

FEEDING OF OLDER INFANTS 
Some general rules : 

1. Unless a child has loose bowels, he should be gi^en from 
1 to 3 tablespoonfuls of orange juice once a day after he is 
about 5 or 6 months old. Up to the time he doubles his 
weight, he has enough iron stored in his body for his needs, 
but after that he needs iron-bearing food. 

2. Do not feed him beef juice, beef tea, or brotlis. The 



452 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

first two particularly, are too high in flavor, and tend to 
putrefaction in the large intestine. 

3. After the twelfth month there is no advantage in con- 
tinuing mother's milk which by that time has deteriorated. 
Artificial food should be gradually substituted, and a single 
meal fed from time to time from" the bottle. A baby 9 
months old may at first have to try a formula of cow's m:!k 
made for a child 6 months old who has been fed artificially 
from the first ; and even a more dilute mixture may be neces- 
sary for a while. 

4. The transition period comes between the tenth and 
fourteenth month. Milk is still the chief food during the 
second year, but the baby must have in addition, iron from 
the yolk of egg, and from orange juice or prune pulp: he 
must also have food for developing chewing muscles and 
teeth, such as stale bread, toasted, and zwieback. He may 
also have thoroughly cooked, strained cereal, preferably oat- 
meal. Other solid food should not be given during the sec- 
ond year. 

5. Feedings must be regular: the digestive tract responds 
to good eating habits. 

Good hours for meals are : 

First feeding 6.30- 7 A. m. 

Mid-morning feeding 9.30-10 a. m. 

Noon feeding 11.30-12 A. M. 

Afternoon feeding 2.30- 3 P. M. 

Evening feeding 5 - 5.30 P. M. 

Bed at six o'clock. 

6. During the third year milk is still one of the most 
important of the child's foods, and a quart should be allowed. 
Cereals need no longer be strained, if thoroughly cooked ; the 
whole egg may be given, although the yolk is still the more 
valuable part; stale bread is still used, but crackers — graham 
or Uneedas — may be substituted *in certain meals. Fruit 
juice, and dried fruits including raisins, dates, and figs are 
valuable, as are green vegetables, such as spinach, peas, and 
carrots. Baked potato may also be given. 



INFANT FEEDING 453 

7. In the fourth year, vegetables and fruits need not be 
strained, and cream may be added to the vegetables. Cab- 
bage, cauliflower, and lettuce must not be given, nor should 
any meat be fed at this age. It is not desirable to give it 
until the child is 7 or 8 years old. 

8. Xever give the baby or young child, cakes, candy, dough- 
nuts, pastry, fresh breads, griddlecakes, sirups or molasses, 
pork or meat of any kind, bananas or any overripe fruit, 
pickles, tea, coffee, soda water, wine, cider, beer, nor tastes 
of the family meals. If this is begun, he will soon demand 
a taste of everything he sees, and his appetite for the simple 
diet which is essential at this age will be quickly destroyed. 

WEANING * 

Weaning is the process whereby the baby is gradually de- 
prived of breast milk. It should proceed slowly, one-bottle 
feeding being substituted for one breast feeding during the 
day for some time, then two bottles, and so on until all breast 
feeding has been done away with and the baby is entirely 
weaned. In order that this change may be accomplished with 
as little disturbance as possible, one bottle feeding may be 
given to the baby in 24 hours as early as the fifth or sixth 
month. This will hardly be sufficient to upset the baby's 
digestion and yet will serve to accustom him to the taste of 
strange food and to the use of the bottle and to begin the 
education of the stomach in dealing with new materials. 

When to Wean. In most cases the baby should be weaned 
by the end of the first year, and in some cases from one to 
three months earlier, depending largely upon the health of 
the baby, the amount and quality of the breast milk, and upon 
the time of the year. It is unwise to wean the baby in the 
heat of summer or when infant illness of any sort is epidemic. 
It has been proved over and over again that breast milk will 
save a sick baby's life and restore him to health after the 
strain of a long hot suirmier, and that often there is no other 
food that can be relied upon to accomplish the same result. 



454 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

Therefore, even though the breast milk must be supplemented 
with one or several bottles, it is vrise to nurse the baby through 
the summer so that the breasts will not cease entirely to se- 
crete and may be called on in an emergency. If the baby is 
weaned at 10 months or earlier he may be fed by bottle : if 
not until the end of the year, he may be taught to drink from 
a glass or cup directly. 

If drinking water has been given by means of a nursing 
bottle during much of the first year, the baby will take his 
food in the same way the more readily. A healthy infant 
weaned at 9 months should begin with the food for an infant 
of 4 or 5 montlis. If he digests this mixture well, the 
strength can be increased until within two or three weeks 
he is taking the food full strength. Increase in the diet 
should be made with special caution at the beginning of 
summer or during the heat, when there is great danger of 
inducing diarrhea. It is far better to keep the bahy on rather 
a low diet, even without increasing his weight, than to upset 
the intestinal tract by overfeeding. If, after trving a new 
food, vomiting occurs or the stools show that there is indi- 
gestion, it is always best to return to the weaker food until 
the disturbance has subsided. 

Weaning from the Bottle. An artificially fed infant is 
weaned from the bottle by beginning at 10 months to sub- 
stitute one feeding a day from the spoon or cup for one bottle 
feeding, gradually increasing the number of such feedings 
until the baby is weaned, usually by the thirteenth month. 
The mother will find it a convenience to continue the bottle 
for the night feedings as long as necessary.

CHAPTEE XXII 
THE FEEDING OF YOUNG CHILDREN 

Whether the child be fed at the breast or with the bottle, 
the period from the tenth to the fifteenth month is usually 
one of transition. For the breast-fed baby it may be more 
critical than for the artificially fed; but the former should 
ordinarily have been growing used to a certain proportion 
of cow's milk in his diet. By the fifth or sixth month iron- 
bearing foods such as yolk of egg and orange juice should 
be added to the diet. The white of egg maV be used if the 
baby cannot take milk. By the ninth month thorouglily 
cooked gruel may te added to the milk diet. 

Throughout tne growing period the child should have at 
least a quart of milk a day. When he is a year old, he may 
have, in addition to the milk, strained cereals, stale bread, 
toast or zweiback, soft-cooked egg (especially the yolk), 
fruit juice or fruit pulp, such as orange juice and prune 
pulp. Such a diet should continue well through the sec- 
ond year. By the end of that time well-cooked, strained 
or finely mashed vegetables, such as baked potato, spinach, 
carrots, and peas, may be added. It is no longer necessar)'^ 
to strain the cereals if they are thorouglily cooked. Stale 
bread is still given, but crackers such as graham and Uneedas 
may be substituted in certain meals. Fruits should be given 
daily, and raisins, dates, and figs are valuable additions to 
those already named. If a distaste for milk arises, the va- 
rietv' of other foods should be cut down, and every effort made 
to lead the child back to it. In fact there should be little 
variet}' up to the fifth year. During the fourth year it is 
unnecessary to strain vegetables and fruits. Cream may be 

455 



456 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

added to the vegetables. Meat is very undesirable for young 
children, and should not be given until about the seventh 
year, since protein is obtainable in more easily digested forms 
from milk and eggs. Sweet fruits, such as prunes, dates, and 
figs, are much better than pure sugar, since they contain val- 
uable mineral constituents, and are less likely to destroy the 
taste for other proper food. 

Tea, coffee, beer, and even cocoa except occasionally and 
very weak, should be prohibited. The child should no more 
expect to eat the same food as an adult than to dress like one. 
But his diet should be limited in quality rather than quantity, 
as he requires much more in proportion than an adult on 
account of his requirements for growth and his great activity. 
Up to five years of age, about eighty calories per kilogram 
seems to be desirable. 

A well-known dispensary sends out printed instructions for 
the people of its' neighborhood, prohibiting all eating between 
meals, and forbidding all pastry, coffee, tea, alcoholics and 
carbonated drinks, in the case of children of any age. 

Those under seven years of age are allowed no meats nor 
fish, no hot bread, griddlecakes, or nuts, no corn, cucumbers, 
egg plant, nor cabbage. 

For those under four years no stews, tomatoes, bananas, 
and fruit sparingly in hot weather. 

Children up to the age of eighteen months are to be limited 
entirely to milk, orange juice, and cooked and strained cereals ; 
with, in exceptional cases, zwieback, biscuit and soft-cooked 
eggs. 

Such education means much for the development of hardy 
men and women. Undernutrition is not due alone to pov- 
erty; much of it comes from ignorance. 

GENERAL RULES FOR FEEDING YOUNG CHILDREN 
Thompson i 

1. Allow time for meals. 

2. See that the food is thoroughly masticated.

THE FEEDING OF YOUNG CHILDREN 457 

3. Do no allow nibbling between meals. 

4. Do not tempt the child with the sight of rich and in- 
digestible food. 

5. Do not force the child to eat against his will, but exam- 
ine the mouth, which may be sore from erupting teeth; and 
examine the food, which may not be properly cooked ©r 
flavored. If good food is refused from peevishness merely, 
remove it and do not offer it again before the next time. 

6. In acute illness reduce and dilute the food at once.

sionally a ready-to-eat cereal, especially in the summer. 
A generous supply of milk should be served with any of these, 

but no sugar need be added. 
Stale bread : as toast, zweiback. very crusty rolls baked a second 
time after they are at least a day old. Tliese help to develop 
chewing habits. 
Milk to drink : never very cold, and may be served hot on winter 
mornings. Weak cocoa may also be given. 
Mid-morning Luncheon : 

Cradcers: such as graham, whole wheat, Uneeda. 
Fruit: ripe apple, fig, dates, or raisins. 



THE FEEDING OF YOUNG CHILDREN 459 

yoon Meal: 

Soup: made with milk and vegetable juice, or pulp. 

An egg: dropped on toast, or poached, or made into an omelet, 

but never fried. 
A green vegetable: of mild flavor, mashed or finely chopped. 
Spinach (rich in iron), carrots, peas. Potato, and asparagus 

tips are all valuable. 

Since it is undesirable for the child under seven or eight 
rears to have meat, much of the variety in the diet comes 
through the wise choice and careful cooking of vegetables. 
By forming this good eating habit the child is furnished with 
building material while he is young, and with a means of 
keeping the body in good condition as he grows older. 

Dessert : 

Let this be kept simple, as: rice and milk, cereal puddings, baked 
custard, junket, and blanc mange. Frozen creams are also 
allowed, but milk sherbets are better than sweet creams. 
Afternoon luncheon : 

Crackers, or sponge cake, 
ililk. 

Fruit, or baked custard. 
.Sapper.- 

This meal should be very simple up to the eighth or ninth year, 

and served not later than six o'clock. 
Bread and milk. 
Milk toast. 
Creamy egg on toast. 

Children from two to five years of age thrive best with 
about 10% protein in the total food. If the protein is in- 
creased beyond 15%, there is a direct rise in heat output. 
There is, furthermore, interference with the body's ability 
to store protein for tissue. Beef juice and meats should be 
kept out of the diet for the following reasons : their flavor is 
too high and tends to throw bland foods into disfavor : meats 
are more expensive than other foods furnishing protein, such 
as milk and eggs, and they tend to putrefaction in the large 
intestine. Children are more sensitive than adults to putre- 
factive organisms. 

As soon as the child begins going to school, the tendency 
to slight breakfast must be guarded against carefully. The 



460 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

results of carelessness with this meal are lack of appetite, 
anasmia, and stunted growth. A regular schedule for meals 
is an essential to good digestion. The morning and after- 
noon luncheons must be simple: no other nibbling between 
meals should be allowed. 

After the sixth or seventh year sugar ma}' be given — candy, 
very simple, after meals, never between meals. If the extra 
meals always consist of only one or two simple foods, they 
will be naturally discontinued when the child no longer feels 
hungry for them ; yet while there is really need of extra fuel, 
that need will be met. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF FEEDING SICK CHILDREN 

Since this work has been chiefly devoted, as the title im- 
plies, to the relationship between diet and disease, the amount 
of space given to the feeding of presumably normal children 
may occasion some wonderment. But the chief difference be- 
tween the dietetics of the infant and adult lies in the fact that 
the bottle infant and the weanling, nominally healthy, have 
to be dieted to prevent disease. This has now come to be 
realized on all sides. In classic and mediaeval times an infant 
which could not get breast milk usually perished. The wean- 
ing period was somewhat less trying, but millions of children 
must have succumbed to the ordeal of changing to solid food. 
Improvement in feeding means a direct lessening of infant 
mortality, as modem statistics testify. 

Colic and Vomiting (Eegurgitation) are almost physiolog- 
ical, so common is their occurrence; they do not arise from 
any single cause, and the fact that breast-fed infants suffer 
almost as frequently as the bottle-fed, often more so, shows 
that such ailments are not entirely preventable by care in feed- 
ing. In breast-fed children, these symptoms are best con- 
trolled by lengthening the period between feedings. In bottle- 
fed children, besides lengthening the nursing interval, special 
pains should be taken in the modification of the milk. These 
symptoms may occur quite independently of diet. Chilling 
of the body surface, coughing, improper handling, a too snug 



THE FEEDING OP YOUNG CHILDREN 461 

binder, etc., may be the true cause of the trouble. Even in 
breast-fed infants under ideal conditions, the mother's milk 
may not be well-bome. It may in fact be so rich in fat and 
protein as to require dilution; which of course in the breast- 
fed may be accomplished only by giving the infant water be- 
fore or after nursing. 

Garage. Of late years the use of the stomach sound in 
feeding sick nurslings has come into considerable vogue in 
foundling asylums and the like. This resource has a con- 
siderable range of application. Thus in premature infants 
(which do not nurse readily) ; in all infants which refuse to 
nurse ; and in infants sick from any cause, especially when the 
nerve centers, swallowing or breathing apparatus are involved, 
or when continuous vomiting is present, the use of the stom- 
ach tube may save life. Very young babies are fed much 
more readily than older ones, since they are less liable to 
fright. The tube used is a soft rubber catheter, which is 
coupled with a small funnel. The catheter is first passed 
down the gullet. In order to have plenty of leeway, it is an 
advantage to unite the catheter to a second rubber tube with 
a piece of glass tubing. The second rubber tube is then 
coupled to the funnel. If the case be one of vomiting, it is 
often necessary to wash out the stomach before the introduc- 
tion of nourishment, however given. The term lavage, used 
for washing out the stomach, must not be confounded with 
garage, which means literally forced feeding. Complete de- 
tails will be found in works on obstetrics and obstetric nurs- 
ing. Edgar says of gavage, that the infant to be fed should 
lie on its back in the nurse's arms, its own arms held to its 
sides, M-hile an extra assistant steadies the head. The tube 
having been passed, the modified milk or other nutriment is 
poured into the funnel, and as the latter empties itself the 
tube is pinched to prevent escape. While regurgitation may 
occur and necessitate a repetition of the act, it very often 
happens that food taken in this manner is much better re- 
tained than if taken by nursing the breast or bottle. The 
exertion required by nursing, the swallowing of air, etc., are 



462 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

avoided in gavage. To recapitulate, the conditions in which 
gavage has been found life saving, are given by Edgar in the 
following order : 

Prematurity (especially in incubator babies) ; after opera- 
tions on the nose and throat; habitual vomiting; pneumonia, 
diphtheria and scarlet fever. The jaws of the nursling can 
usually be separated to receive the gavage-tube. But if there 
is inflammation of the mouth or locking of the Jaws (or if 
intubation has been required for diphtheritic cases) it may be 
necessary to resort to nasal feeding (see p. 79). 

Diarrhcea. Under this familiar term, which includes the 
mildest looseness of the bowels as well as the severest symp- 
toms of cholera and dysentery, may be included the greater 
part of the morbidity of the nursling. Death certificates of 
babies, especially in summer months, chiefly specify this cause. 
The diarrhoea makes itself felt in a variety of ways. If con- 
joined with vomiting we may term it a gastro-enteritis, and 
state that a given child died from inability to profit by its 
nourishment. But many infants succumb, not because their 
nourishment is rejected outright, but rather from the fact that 
it is not utilized. We can understand death when due to vio- 
lent vomiting and diarrhoea; but the slow death from non- 
utilization of food, such as occurs so extensively in bottle-fed 
tenement house children, still remains largely a mysterj^, whicli 
has been explained in the most diverse ways. The amount 
and character of gastro-intestinal disturbance present is not 
sufficient, in many cases at least, to explain the total failure 
of nutrition. It is in the effort to combat this condition that 
so many methods of feeding have come into use. As in all 
stubborn and imperfectly understood conditions, with a bad 
outlook for recovery, many substances have been tested, and 
many recoveries have been recorded. If a threatening diar- 
rhoea appears, with or without vomiting, the best course to 
pursue at first seems to be fasting. Sterile water may be al- 
lowed but milk is prohibited. It is believed by some au- 
thorities that cow's milk or the milk of any animal is poison- 
ous in these cases. Others would state that milk is dangerous 



THE FEEDING OF YOUNG CHILDREN 463 

because of one or another solid ingredient, or because it 
furnishes a culture medium for germs. In any case some pre- 
digested food like panopepton, or some cereal decoction like 
rice or barley water seems better borne. It may also be ad- 
visable at this stage to use certain drugs to control vomiting. 
"When the latter has ceased for twenty-four hours, normal feed- 
ing may be cautiously resumed. The treatment of these cases 
taxes the utmost resources of the physician, and the mortality 
is enormous. The nurse's duties lie rather in the direction 
of prevention ; but if these cases develop, rest of the stomach 
is imperative at first and milk must not be resumed until all 
S}Tnptoms are passed. Diarrhoea, dysentery and all gastro- 
intestinal troubles in older children are dieted on the same 
principles as are the same aifections in adults. 

Constipation in nurslings is a condition difficult to over- 
come entirely by diet. The familiar remedies are sugar and 
cream, an excess of either of which, over dietetic requirements, 
may loosen the bowels. A prescription of laboratory milk 
may meet this obstacle, or the corresponding home modifica- 
tion. Fruit juices, oatmeal gruel, etc., are sometimes em- 
ployed. 

Marasmus and Rickets are two conditions generally in- 
cluded under diseases amenable to diet. There is no special 
regimen, however, for such affections : a full balanced diet 
cannot be improved on. Infantile Scurvy should be named in 
the same connection, and is the result of an unbalanced diet 
or absence of vitamines. Orange juice and a change in the 
diet will usually cure the disease promptly. 



CHAPTER XXIII 
THE ADOLESCENT— THE SEDENTARY— THE AGED 

DIET FOR THE ADOLESCENT 

The growing youth needs extra protein food for the build- 
ing of protoplasm and a sufficiency of salts for the rapidly 
forming tissues; earthly salts for bones, iron for blood, phos- 
phorus for nervous tissue and its general influence on growth, 
obtained from the average liberal mixed diet with milk, eggs, 
fresh fruit and green vegetables, so that no special plan of 
feeding is required. If the adolescent leads a very active ex- 
istence, equivalent to hard labor in an adult, he will naturally 
require the same amount of food with necessary reduction for 
weight, and some allowance for extra protein. Many ado- 
lescents, however, are ver\^ sluggish and lead inactive lives, and 
need encouragement to activity, with food in proportion to 
its degree. Again the appetite is not always a safe guide, 
especially for girls; for the period of adolescence coincides 
with the development of " hysterical " tendencies which may 
be manifested by excessive or diminished craving for food 
without any reference to the actual physical demands. Girls 
should be trained out of fads. An active adolescent may have 
but little appetite while a sluggish one may be a glutton, or 
may continually drink water. The perverted cravings for 
substances of no nutritive value and without appetizing qual- 
ity, which accompany this period, are well known. It is 
therefore necessary that the diet of this period be as care- 
fully supervised as that for the little child. The food must 
conform to the subject's physical requirements, must be eaten 
regularly, and must be administered with discretion, for a 
large percentage of food aversions are acquired at this time, 
and it is essential to the well-being of the individual, and the 

464 



DIET FOR THE ADOLESCENT 465 

comfort of others, that his food habits be good. In college 
food should be prepared with reference to work. 

The energy requirements of this period are approximately : j 

Pboteix Calories Total Calories 

Age in Yeabs per Pound per Pound 

12-13 3 25-30 

14-17 20-25 

" This means that the total daily requirements for girls 
from fourteen to seventeen will be from 2200 to 2600 Calories ; 
for boys of the same age from 2500 to 3000 Calories. Very 
often by this time the full height will have been attained and 
the parents are surprised at the large consumption of food, 
thinking that growth has ceased. But growth is not merely 
a question of height. As already said, it involves laying on 
of muscle and fat, development of internal organs and a vigor- 
ous nervous system, and these demand food. Furthermore, 
muscular activity, especially out of doors, is a great aid in 
muscle and nerve development, and the extra fuel required 
to support this activity should never be begrudged young peo- 
ple. For five or ten years after full height is reached their 
food consumption will be considerably higher than that of 
adults of the same size. As long as they confine themselves 
to simple, nourishing foods they are not likely to overeat. 
Sometimes their expenditures in growth and acti\ity exceed 
their assimilative powers. Especially is this true of those 
who grow very tall with great rapidity and indulge freely in 
active sports and dancing. To leave a balance in favor of 
the body it may be for a time necessary to curtail the activity 
somewhat — to insist on longer hours for rest and less violent 
exercise until substantial gains in weight and other signs of 
physical welfare show that the energy demands are not greater 
than the energy' supply." 

" The daily menu list may well include such dishes as the 
following :

466 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

1. Soup, as tomato, green pea, split pea, white and black bean. 

2. Two or three hot dishes, as spaghetti with tomato sauce, 
mashed potatoes with green peas, baked beans, corn pudding, a stew 
with vegetables or a hot roast beef sandwich. 

3. Salads, as potato, egg, fruit, or green vegetable. 

4. Sandwiches, one or two varieties each day. 

5. Fruit, as apples, bananas, stewed fruits of various kinds. 

6. Milk and cocoa. 

7. Plain cake or sweet wafers offered only in combination with 
milk or other plain food. 

8. Ice cream, charlotte russe, simple baked pudding, sweet choco- 
late. 

The evening meal needs to be more substantial than for 
the younger children. In the city this will be the time for 
the regular dinner ; in the country it is more likely to be sup- 
per. Here we must guard against extremes — too heavy a 
meal on the one hand and too light on the other. Supper 
should include one substantial warm dish as a rule. This 
may be a thick soup, as suggested for the younger children, 
macaroni and cheese, a stew or chowder, or a loaf of beans or 
lentils with a cream or tomato sauce. This with plenty of 
bread and butter, some stewed fruit and cookies, or a whole- 
some pudding, and milk to drink, will make a sufficiently 
nourishing repast." 

DIET FOR THE SEDENTARY 

No exact rules can be laid down for the dietetics of the 
sedentary. An individual may lead a technically sedentary 
life, and yet use up a great amount of energy, only standing 
and walking muscles being in disuse just as in a person whose 
occupation requires standing and walking, little use may be 
made of arm, shoulder and trunk muscles. A better distinc- 
tion is between out-door and in-door life, or quiet and active 
existence. True sedentary persons lead both a quiescent and 
an in-door existence, chiefly in the sitting posture. The less 
the exertion, the less the requirement for food. Excess of 
food over actual demands is usually manifested by the putting 



DIET FOR THE AGED 467 

on of flesh or by the development of indigestion or metabolic 
disturbances. In theory there should be no such thing as a 
permissible diet for the sedentar}', because no one should 
allow himself to lead a purely quiescent existence. It is pos- 
sible to compress a good deal of active exercise in a couple 
of hours of the twenty-four, so that the sedentary person passes 
virtually into the next class above, corresponding to light 
active labor extending through a number of hours. 

AMiile individual estimates vary, it is probable that 1600- 
2000 calories suffice for the average individual on the usual 
basis of 145 pounds weight with the usual reduction for sex. 
As the sedentary person finds it difficult to digest heavy arti- 
cles of food, the food should be easily digestible. Fruit and 
succulent vegetables (salads) are usually well borne by seden- 
tary people, as they induce daily evacuations of the bowels, 
and are not fattening. They are the reverse of condensed 
and highly nutritious foods. 

DIET FOR THE AGED 
As there is a radical distinction between a person merely 
old in years and one who is actually senile, no dietary can 
be devised to suit the case of all those of advanced years. A 
man is technically old at sixty. In theory he should require 
less protein in proportion to carbohydrates than a younger 
man. Many people of both sexes, however, preserve their 
working capacity far into the sixties and even into the seven- 
ties. Many people can put on flesh up to the age of sixty, 
and it is very important that they do not do so. Their regi- 
men should be practically that of the corpulent. After the 
age of sixty the weight may remain at an equilibrium for some 
years, or with the advent of senile change, the flesh may be- 
gin to disappear, this loss being physiological. At this period 
less depends on the selection of food than on the quantity 
and thoroughness of mastication. An active, healthy man 
can preserve his condition by cutting down the amount of 
food greatly, and chewing it thoroughly. The demand for 
nrotein will very likely be satisfied with a small quantity. 



468 DIET IN SPECIAL CONDITIONS 

The total fuel requirement will depend upon whether the in- 
dividual exercises or leads a sedentary life. Sedentary elderly 
people can subsist on very little food, and do not difiEer much 
in this respect from middle-aged sedentary people. 

A senile person is practically an invalid, and his dietetic 
demands do not diifer greatly from those of other invalids 
(aside from the convalescent). If the teeth are more or less 
useless, and mastication cannot be effected by the gums, the 
individual becomes a confirmed dyspeptic. The problem of 
starch digestion becomes a serious one. Milk can be used 

largely. 

In theory sugars could partially replace starches. An ex- 
cellent food under the circumstances is toasted bread, which 
may be dipped in coffee to soften it. In toast the starch be- 
comes changed to dextrin, which is bat one step removed from 
sugar. Well-cooked cereals, vegetables (potatoes, greens, etc.) 
and fruits may be used in small quantities in the expectation 
that they will be digested by the pancreatic juice. 

Special Eegimen : As already suggested, this cannot differ 
in kind from that of the confined invalid or dyspeptic. 

DIETi: fifoup.— Nutritious soups, sucli as chicken or fish pur^e, 
beef tea, mutton or chicken broth. Purges of all kinds. 

Fish.— White fish as sole, whiting, smelts, flounders, etc. (best 
when boiled) . 

Eggs.— Egg lightly cooked, or beaten up with milk, etc. 

Meats.— Young and tender chicken and game. Other tender moats. 
Potted chicken, game and other potted meats. Sweetbreads, bacon 
grilled. 

Farinaceous.— Bread and butter (bread at least a day old) to be 
soaked in tea or milk or water. Bread and milk, porridge and oat- 
meal gruel. Puddings of ground rice, tapioca, arrowroot, sago, maca- 
roni. Prepared foods consisting of predigested starches. 

Vegetables.— Potatoes, carrots, spinach and other succulent vege- 
tables, stewed celery, boiled onions. 

Desserts.— Fruit jellies, stewed or baked fruit. Pulp of perfectly 
ripe raw fruit in small quantity, farinaceous puddings. 

Liquids. — Milk in all forms, and with the addition of warm Vichy 
or warm water, fruit juice.

2 " It is roughly estimated that the decrease in food require- 
ment due to old age, from the total fuel which would be 
required by an adult of the same degree of activity, is about 
10 per cent, between the ages of sixty and seventy; about 20 
per cent, between seventy and eighty; and about 30 per cent 
after that. In other words a man who at thirty requires per 
day 2000 Calories simply sitting at rest, will require under 
the same circumstances only about 1800 at seventy and only 
1600 at eighty. The ordinary activities of a man of thirty 
may raise his energy output to 3500 Calories per day, but few 
men of eighty could do sufficient muscular work to transform 
so much additional fuel. Their lives are likely to be decidedly 
sedentary; hence 1600 to 1800 Calories will probably closely 
approximate their total daily expenditure, though no abso- 
lute rule can be laid down. In general, there is safety in 
abstemiousness; dangers of excess are greater than dangers 
of undernutrition."

HORSFORD'S 

Acid Phosphate 

The nurse is justified in recom- 
mending the use of Horsford's 
Acid Phosphate as a sickroom bev- 
erage. As a basis for albuminous 
drinks and fruit punches, or simply 
added to the patient's drinking 
water, it affords a welcome change 
to the invalid on a limited or pre- 
scribed diet. 

The Nurse Herself 

will find in Horsford's Acid Phosphate a 
relief from many of the conditions brought 
on by overwork and the so-called brain- 
fag." Non-alcoholic, and containing no 
narcotics, it nevertheless has a refreshing 
and stimulating effect in cases of reduced 
nerve energy.

CALFS FOOT JELLIES 

This particular form, of appetizing nourish- 
ment is prescribed by doctors, and used ex- 
tensively in hospitals, as the most nourishing 
food for invalids, especially in cases where the 
stomach will not retain more solid foods. 

Patients have thrived upon it, alone, for long 
periods, with an appreciable gain in strength. 

Served with shaved or cracked ice, it will be 
found tempting to a poor appetite. At a tem- 
perature of 60 degrees, it becomes a delicate 
jelly which will dissolve quickly when placed 
on the tongue; 

(In half-pint and pint glass 
jars, and 9 oz. tumblers) 

Flavors; Sherry, Port, Rum, Cognac and Plain.

For the Sick, Convalescent or Well there is 
no finer energy producing food than 

Minute Tapioca 

Its food value is particularly important because 
of its ready digestibility and its easy conversion 
into bodily energy. Minute Tapioca is as pure 
as tapioca can possibly be made and is «o pre- 
pared that it softens immediately, thus making 
it very desirable when a particularly nourishing 
and healthful dessert is required quickly. 

Try the Minute Tapioca recipes in this book. 
A section of our Minute Cook Book is de- 
voted to recipes of some especially dsunty, 

nourishing desserts for the sick 

room.

FEEDING THE FAMILY 

By Mary Swartz Rose 

This is a clear and concise account in simple everyday terms 
of the ways in which modem knowledge of the science of nutri- 
tion may be applied in ordinary life. The food needs of tlie 
different members of the typical family group— men, women, 
infants, children of various ages— are discussed in separate chap- 
ters, and many concrete illustrations in the form of food plans 
and dietaries are included. The problems of the housewife in 
trying to reconcile the needs of different ages and tastes at the 
same table are also taken up, as are the cost of food and the con- 
struction of menus. A final chapter deals with feeding the sick. 

Probably no publication in this field of recent date has found 
such insUnt favor and been so widely received. It surpasses all 
previous efforts at a practical, non-technical, but thoroughly 
scientific, presentation of the subject of nutrition. Its use by 
housewives and college classes is equally successful.

the Ordinary 
"Double Boiler" 

In Hospitals foods are steam- 
cooked. There you have "Diet 
Kitchens" to simplify tlie exact- 
ing work of providing the proper 
foods properly prepared. 

*0n the case" you know how 
very different it is! Here, in the 
average home you have no "Diet 
Kitchen" conveniences — to say 
nothing of even %\xc\v first necessities, 
to th e hospital, as ' 'steam cooking' ' . 

Thus it is thtlt here, on the case, your Jfrrf 
aid. your (A«/help is the "SAVORY" sUam- 
eooiine Double Boiler. You should know this 
— how it applies scientifit findfUs to Double 
Boiler cooking , 

The thtrmomettrs tell the story. 

When you use a "SAVORY" Double 
Boiler, you cook in /it» steam at a constant, 
even temperature of 212°— while the cookine 
temperature in an ordinary double boiler (heat 
transmitted tbroufli metal walls and steam dis- 
ctiareed in the room) is only 192°. ten per 
cent less. 

.. ^5^ise of its steam-cookinf method, the 
SAVORY" saves food values, "appetizin?" 
flavors that stimulate and aid digestion, the 
valuable inineral salts your patients need— those 
«lements "boiling" boils out. Makes the tex- 
ture of foods you sene delightful, too. Saves 
jaur time, work, and worry. And this compact, 
health-helping, simple— though u:.ique — uten- 
sil is inexpensive. 

Just introduce it into the home, 
and diet is not only a relatively 



ase 

easy matter while you are on the 
case but you will have conferred a 
lasting benefit on the household for 
the "SAVORY" steam-cooking 
Double Boiler makes for every- 
day-of-the-year help and health. 
Your services, in introducing, 
this utensil alone, will long be re- 
membered to your credit. 

^_ Light, easy to use. always ready, the 
SAVORY" is one of the first items to pre- 
scribe in any case; a help to physicians, nurses, 
dieticians, and all others interested in the cor- 
rect, yet easy, preparation of foods for the sul>- 
normal as well as normal appetite. 

Sometimes the nurse takes her own 
"SAVORY" Double Boiler with her to the 
case. It is so u-idrly helpful ! For it may also 
be used for sterilizing — in live steam — for keep*

DRYCO BRAND 
DRY MILK 

{formerly called Honor Brand) 

Is simply the finest quality of liquid milk from 
which all of the water and part of the butter fat 
has been removed. (Contains 12^ Fat in the 
dry state.) 

Dryco Brand Dry !Milk is more digestible and 
nutritious than liquid or any other form of milk. 

Because of its high Caloric value, and because 
its available fraction for absorption is so high, 
Dryco Brand Dry IMilk has supplied a great gap 
in the feeding of the acutely ill and convalescent. 

Because of its small bulk it is possible to sup- 
ply a great nutritional deficit without causing the 
patient to refuse extra feedings because of the 
amount. 

In febrile conditions, where the proteid de- 
struction is great and the consequent loss in 
weight is rapid, Dryco Brand Dry Milk has 
proved invaluable. 

The gains in weight, following the use of 
Dryco Brand Dry Milk in the convalescent period 
following typhoid, pneumonia, empyema, os- 
teomyelitis and other suppurative conditions, 
have been startling.

MARY SWARTZ ROSE'S 
NEW BOOK 

EVERYDAY FOODS IN WAR TIME 

By Mary Swartz Rose 

"This little book," so the Preface informs the 
reader, ' was started in response to a request for 'a war 
message about food.' It seems to the author that a 
simple explanation of the part which some of our com- 
mon foods play in our diet might be both helpful and 
reassuring. To change one's menu is often trying; 
to be uncertain whether the substituted foods will pre- 
serve one's health and strength makes adjustment 
doubly difficult. It is hoped that the chapters of this 
volume will make k easier to 'save wheat, meat, sugars 
and fats' and to make out an accep«'able bill-of-fare 
without excessive cost." Among the chapters into 
which the text is divided are the following: The Milk 
Pitcher in the Home, Cereals We Ought to Eat, 
Meat We Ought to Save, The Potato and Its Substi- 
tutes, Are Fruits and Vegetables Luxuries .f", Sugar and 
Spice and Everything Nice, Fat and Vitamines, On 
Being Economical and Patriotic at the Same Time.

THE GLUTEN OF WHEAT 
SEPATIATED BY A SCIENTIFIC PROCESS RETAIN- 
ING THE NATURAL PHOSPHATES AND SALTS 

For the special benefit and convenience of the busy prac- 
titioner, who has scant time for extended research, we have 
collected from experiences of the highest authoritative 
sources as follows: 

"There is no other single food-substance in the whole realm of Nature 
so important and valuable in human diet as this chief nourisher, Gluten, 
resident in all vegetable forms. Gluten is the prime structural necessity 
of cereal growth, the spinal column in all vegetable life. Distinctively, 
it is the one great muscle-maker of the cereal grains, without whicn they 
would be as useless as the soil deprived of sunlight and moisture." 

— Prof. Parshall in "Food Values." 
'"Gluten extracted from wheaten flour satisfies by itself prolonged and 
complete nutrition." 

— The French Academy of Science. 
"Gluten is the most important of all nitrogenous substances because 
it is capable of supporting life when given alone." 

— Henry Lewes in "Physiology of Common Life." 
"Gluten satisfies in itself all that Nature demands for prolonged and 
complete^ niitrition. It is a non-acid-making, non-fermenting food, and 
we feel justified in asking physicians to give it a thorough trial. ' 

— Albert Harris Hoy, M. D., in "Eating and Drinking." 
"With the system making free use of Gluten there is no opportunity 
for toxaemia. It makes a Llood in which toxins are out of place." 

— Gifford Knox, M. D. 
"Undoubtedly, millions of human beings are today committing slow 
suicide by a too excessive ingestion of the carbohydrates." 

—Dr. F. \V. Pavey, R. S.. London. 

GLUTEN AS A BUILDER 

Gluten Foods as prepared by this company, being a high concen- 
tration of the combined nutrients of the wheat grain, are remarkably 
rich in nucleo-albumen and all other cell-building material. They are 
capable of greatly quickening the integrating processes of cell life, and 
giving impulsive energy in tiie revival of the system. 

They may be given in the form of the most delicate and tasty soups 
or broths made from our Gluten flour; or in the form of bread, rolls, 
gems or muffins ; and also in the form of breakfast food and many otlier 
forms as shown in our book of recipes. 

A little gluten at a meal, even once a day, is noticeable in the well 
being of the individual. 

524 



THE VALUE OF GLUTEN KNOWN FOR CENTURIES 

The ancient Greeks knew the value of gluten as a special diet and 
learned to wash it out from wheat flour. This has been done in all 
of the old countries for ages. Dr. Knox found the Indian women of 
Canada separating it and making bread and biscuits for any member of 
the family under a severe strain, and always using it to strengthen the 
mother before child birth. 

The gluten gives to flour that nutty flavor. Extracted by itself it 
is somewhat bitter but satisfying. 

To eliminate Fatigue Poison, the dead worn-out cells from our own 
system IS quite enough without taking in more from eating meat. The 
clean Gluten protein extracted from wheat saves that overwork. 

Hoyt's Gluten in a gruel added to milk for infant feeding forms it 
into flakes like mother's milk instead of curdling into a ball. It makes 
cross babies good and builds muscle. Children always Uke it.

Treatment without internal medication is highly desirable in Whooping 
Cou^h and Spasmodic Croup, particularly in the very young. The value 
of \apo-Cresolene depends upon its antiseptic power and the sedative 
influence of the vapor diffused through the air, and thus constantly 
breathed by the patient. Breathing becomes easy, desire to cough is 
allayed and the patient gains needful rest. 

The diseases in which Cresolene has been especially utilized are 
"Whooping Cough, Spasmodic Croup, Influenza, Bronchitis, 
Asthma, Broncho-pneumonia, the bronchial complications of Scar- 
let-Fever and Measles and as an aid in the treatment of Diphtheria. 

A 1% solution of Cresolene in water kills the germs of Diphtheria, 
T>-phoid Fever and pus at once. Cresolene is less toxic than carbolic- 
acid and has a greater germicidal value.

Director of School Luncheons, Philadelphia, Pa., formerly Instructor 

in Domestic Science, Drexel Institute, Philadelphia; and 

Instructor in Dietetics, The Johns Hopkins Hospital 

Training School for Nurses, Baltimore, Md. 

"INSTITUTION RECIPES" is unlike the usual cookery book 

which is designed for use in the home, as the recipes here 

given are in quantities to serve fifty, or one hundred and fifty portions. 

This third edition of Institution Recipes has been carefully 
revised. Many new recipes have been added for soups, meats, 
salads, sandwiches and desserts, which are appropriate for the 
School Luncheon, Cafeteria, Mountain Camp, College and Hospital 

The use of flour substitutes, to conform with the Food 
Administration regulations, is also treated. 

A new feature is the addition of the Caloric Value of a 
single serving of each recipe. This will simplify the labor of 
planning the balanced menu. 

Institution Recipes has proved indispensable to the dietition 
in hospitals, colleges, school lunch rooms; in the United States 
Government Cantonments and Base Hospitals; and in Young 
Men's and Young Women's Christian Association Cafeterias in 
all parts of the United States and Canada. 

The Teacher of Home Econon ics cannot afford to be with- 
out this standard work, as a general reference book, and as a 
text-book for the course in Institutional Management.
