FACT SHEET ON PEACHES 



The Situation (as of June 11) 

The largest peach crop on record — 4 percent above the previous peak year, 
1941 — is expected from 10 Southern States this year. The June estimate 
issued by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics indicates that peach produc- 
tion in the 10 Southern States will probably be more than 26 million 
bushels, compared with a 10-year average of about 16 million bushels. The 
heaviest production will center in Georgia and the Carolinas, amounting to 
about 16 million bushels, compared to about 9 million bushels for the 
10-year average* The result is a serious problem because everything pos- 
sible must be done to prevent loss of this valuable food. Carlo t shipments 
are anticipated to be about double those of last year. Approximately 85 to 
90 percent of the rail shipments of southern peaches in 1944 were from 
these States. 

Transportation and Timing 

The railroads indicate that they expect to be able to handle the large 
shipments of peaches expected from the Georgia-Carolina area, and they have 
guaranteed plenty of ice, although there may be times during the next two 
months when the supply of refrigerator cars will be a day or two late. 

The crop in Georgia and the Carolinas is from 10 days to two weeks early. 
Maximum truck and rail shipments, it is estimated, will amount to 22,000 to 
23,000 cars, leaving about 10,000 to 11,000 cars of peaches to be utilized 
locally in other ways. Peak shipments probably will be made from June 24 
to July 21, when about 70 percent of the crop will move, with a peak week 
from July 8 to 14, when approximately 4,500 cars are expected to move. 
However, in view of theMiransportation situation slowing up movements of 
freight It will take a week or more for many of these peaches to reach 
their destinations so that the peak week of supply on the markets is 
expected to be July 15-21. 

Estimated rail and truck shipments of peaches from Georgia and the Carolinas 
and estimated total rail shipments from other important peach producing 
States and in the United States are shown.

Where The Peach Crop Goes 

Shipments of peaches from the three southern States — Georgia and the 
Carolinas, — normally go as far north as Canada and to practically all 
markets east of the Mississippi, and this season they are expected to go even 
to many markets west of the Mississippi. 

While California is one of the largest peach producing States, a large part 
of its production consists of clingstone peaches. These are used mostly for 
canning and drying. However, California does ship a considerable volume of 
freestone peaches in boxes to midwestern and some eastern markets, although 
high freight rates prevent large shipments when midwestern and southern peaches 
are plentiful. Washington peaches are marketed in a manner similar to those of 
California. 

Arkansas supplies peaches to most of the markets west of the Mississippi, 
extending as far as the Rocky Mountains. Colorado peaches are distributed 
mostly in Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas. Much of the Texas 
peach crop is absorbed locally, and the same is true of the Alabama, Tennessee, 
and Mississippi crops. 

Virginia and the northeastern States distribute their peaches mostly along 
the Eastern Seaboard and in nearby States. Illinois and Michigan peaches go to 
supply the midwest markets. 

Containers For Shipping 

A sufficient supply of hew containers is expected to be available for the 
shipment of approximately 21,000 cars of peaches in the Georgia-Carolina 
peach area. This supply will be supplemented by the use of a considerable 
number of good used containers. 

The Solution 

1. Full cooperation of brokers, the wholesale fruit and vegetable trade and 
all retail outlets over the widest possible area to move peaches in the 
largest quantities consumers will accept. 

2. An intensive promotion program to encourage (a) maximum use of peaches to 
meet current food needs and (b) maximum home-canning and community canning of 
peaches. Commercially canned fruits will be short this year, and point 
values are expected to be high. The berry crop is light. Peaches will be 
the one fruit crop this year that will be plentiful for home and community 
canning. 

3. The need for food is greater than ever before, President Truman stated 
recently. Home preservation of food this year, the President pointed out, is 
Just as important as production in view of the increased war requirements for 
commercially processed foods.

Following are pointers from the Bureau of Human Nutrition & Home Economics: 
Nutritional Note On Peaches 

Delicious flavor is reason enough for eating peaches. On the nutritive side, 
peaches at the peak of ripeness offer a fair amount of vitamin C. The 
vitamin C value increases as the peach matures. In addition, yellow fleshed 
peaches are a good source of vitamin A. 

To Make Good Use Of Peaches 

It's hard to beat peaches eaten the simplest ways.. .out of hand. • .sliced with 
cream or top milk. • .served as a fruit cup alone or with other fruit. Sliced 
peaches and raspberries or blackberries for example are a combination to 
please both palate and eye. 

Keep ripe peaches cool until used. Spread them out to avoid bruising. Let 
peaches that are a little on the green side ripen at room temperature. 

To keep sliced peaches from turning dark and unattractive, either peel just 
before using, or sprinkle the cut fruit with a little lemon juice. 

Go light on sweetenings. To keep the sugar in the sugar bowl, experiment — 
try a little honey, sirup, or other sweetening on hand. 

Let sliced peaches top a bowl of cereal, hot or cold. 

Use chilled peaches in refreshing salads. ..halved peaches nesting in crisp 
lettuce, for example. • .sometimes with cottage cheese or cream cheese or 
chopped fruit in the hollow of the peach half. Or combine peaches and other 
fruits, crisp and cold, and cut in slices or good-sized diced pieces. A 
fruit salad fits anywhere in a meal: as a starter, with the main course, as 
a dessert. For a warm weather lunch or supper, a generous fruit salad plate 
may need only bread or sandwiches and a beverage. 

Three points on peach cooking: 

1. For easy peeling, dip peaches in boiling water a minute or two, then 
quickly into cold. Skins will slip easily. 

2. A pinch of salt brings out flavor in cooked fruit. 

3. Serve cooked peaches hot to enjoy the fullest flavor and sweetness. 

Broil or bake peach halves, pit side up, in a shallow baking dish. To each' 
piece add a little melted table fat, a very little salt, and sweetening if 
desired. When hot through and lightly browned, the peaches are ready to be 
served hot with the main course or as a dessert. 

With stewed peaches try a dash of spice, cinnamon, perhaps, or clove buds. 

Peach season would not be complete without one or more of the old favorites — 
peach shortcake, pie, or cobbler. Here are some recipes, starting with the 
biscuit dough that is needed for each dessert: 



- 5 - 



Biscuit Dough For Peach Desserts 

2 cups sifted flour 3A teaspoon salt 

3 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon fat 
3/4 cup milk, or enough for soft dough 

Sift dry ingredients and cut in the fat. Make a well in the mixture and add 
the milk slowly and stir from the center with a fork until a soft dough is 
formed. Toss on a lightly floured board and use as directed. For a richer 
dough, cut in more fat. 

Peach Shortcake 

Bake biscuit dough in rounds; split and fill with lightly sweetened sliced 
or chopped peaches. Serve at once with or without cream. 

Peach Cobbler 

Roll out a rich biscuit dough in size to cover a baking dish. Slash the top 
so it will let out the steam. Partly fill the dish with lightly sweetened 
peaches, and cover with the dough. Bake in a hot oven (400° F) until the 
crust is brown. To save on fat in making the dough, use latticed strips 
instead of a sheet of dough over the fruit. 

Peach Turnover 

Cut biscuit dough in circles about the size of a saucer. On one side place 
chopped peaches, lightly sweetened with sirup if necessary. Fold over. 
Crimp the edges and bake. 

"Putting Up" The Peaches 

Peaches are successfully "put up" by a variety of home methods, and the peach 
products may be used many ways in good meals. 

Peaches chosen for home and community canning, freezing, drying, or preserves 
should be table ripe, firm, and perfect. The pink blush on many varieties of 
peach tells little about quality. Background color shows ripeness. When 
processes call for table-ripe fruit, choose peaches with yellow or yellow-white 
ground — not green — and put up the fruit promptly. 

Softer fruits, if sound, are good for peach butter or jam. Slightly underripe 
peaches make the best pickles. 

Home-Canning — First Choice For Many Homemakers 

Peaches are easy to can — they are safely canned in a boillng-water-bath 
canner. No steam pressure canner is needed. And since supplies of commer- 
cially canned fruits for civilians will be smaller in 1945-46 than last year, 
home-canned peaches are "blue points in the pocket." One bushel of peaches 
will yield about 18 to 24 quarts. 

An average of one pound of sugar to 4 quarts finished fruit is the wartime 
guide for home canning. Fifteen pounds of sugar is the maxl mum allowance per 
person for all canning, including sweet spreads and relishes. 



- 6 - 



To stretch sugar in home canning, corn sirup may replace up to 1/3 of the 
sugar, or mild-flavored honey up to 1/2, Strong-flavored sirups or brown 
sugar or molasses should not be used. 

Sugar is not required to keep canned fruit from spoiling, but it is important 
for holding flavor, as well as texture and color. In an emergency a home 
canner can save fruit from wasting by putting up some without sugar, using 
peach Juice from the soft fruit or boiling water as the liquid to fill up the 
jars before processing. 

Freezing Peaches 

For the family that has a home freezer or access to frozen storage locker 
space, freezing is a particularly good way to keep peaches. State experiment 
stations can advise on peach varieties from their regions, suited to freezing* 

One bushel of peaches, allowing for discards, yields about 38 pounds of frozen 
fruit. Fruits ksop their size and shape better in sirup than in dry sugar and 
are easier to pack. Sirup for one pound of the sliced peaches calls for 1/2 
cup (about 1/4 pound) of sugar to 2/3 cup of water. 

Home Drying 

Peaches are successfully dried in the oven; in a dehydratorj and in dry and 
sunny climates, out in the sun. Home drying requires no sugar, but some 
sweetening is generally wanted when dried fruit is served. 

Peach Spreads And Pickles 

Out of the 15 pound maximum allowance of canning sugar per person, 5 pounds 
may be for sweet spreads. Sugar thus used goes farthest in making fruit 
butter, because the fruit pulp boils down and concentrates the natural sugar 
in the fruit. One pound of sugar will sweeten about 3 pints of peach butter. 

In Jam and preserves, which ordinarily call for equal parts by weight of sugar 
and fruit, using 3A &s much sugar is satisfactory. With this, one pound of 
sugar sweetens about 1-1/2 to 2 pints of Jam. 

Pickles come last, since they generally use as much sugar as spreads, and the 
spreads can replace table fat when served with breads. 

Community Food Preservation Centers 

Many homemakers will be able to use canning equipment at food preservation 
centers established through the country. 

Besides canning done for a family, many people give time to can in groups for 
school lunches, hospitals, and other community needs, particularly where 
growers can cooperate by donating suitable fruit. 

For information about starting or using a local food preservation center, ask 
the Extension Service representatives; the State Department of Education at 
the State capital, or the regional food preservation specialist of the War Food 
Administration. Information on the establishment and operation of community 



canning centers — including directions on processing of peaches — may be 
found in "Community Canning Centers," Miscellaneous Publication No. 544* 
United States Department of Agriculture. (May be purchased for 25 cents from 
Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington 25, D. C.)

Fact Sheet on Peachc 



MAR 10 1949 



I June 1946 



1 W *. QEPARTlltffT Of AGRICULTURE I 
Peaches will be plentiful this year. We 1 !! have lots 6T southern peaches, es- 
pecially during the latter part of July, and in the HIdve stern and northern 
States there should' be liberal supplies again all during August and particularly 
in late August and early September. 

The crop is expected to be the second largest on record - only 1 percent smaller 
than the record high production of 1945. The June 1 crop report estimates 1946 
oeach production to be at 81,065,000 bushels, as compared with 81,6 million . 
jushels in 1945, and a 10-year average of less than 60 million bushels. 

Carlot sliipments are expected to be about equal to the heavy shipments of last 
year, and the railroads indicste they will have enough cars and refrigerating 
facilities to handle them. The crop closer to the consuming centers will move 
by truck. In the 11 early Southern States, including Texas, Arkansas, Tennessee, 
Alabarra, Georgia, Horth Carolina and South Carolina, there is expected to be an 
almost adecuate supply of bushel and half -bushel baskets. It is anticipated 
that there may be some deficits in containers in the North and West. 

Bulk of the peach production in the early States (11 Southern States s.nd Calif- 
ornia) rdll be harvested in July; in the mid-season States (middle Atlantic 
States and Central States north of Arkansas and south of michigan) ' in August; 
and in the late States (I'ichigan, New York, the Net/ England States, Colorado, 
Utah, Idaho and Washington) in September. 

The early States represent the. areas ox heaviest peach production. The 1946 pro- 
duction is estimated at 38.5 million bushels, exclusive of California clingstones 
Georgia and the Carolinas will have a combined production of 15,5 million bush- 
els and Arkansas 2.9 million bushels. California will have an estimated produc- 
tion of 12 million bushels of freestone peaches, plus 20.8 million bushels of 
clingstones, which are used for commercial processing. 

Substantial shipments are expected from Georgia in the latter part of June, vjith 
peak shipments during the second and third weeks of July. Peak shipments from 
Arkansas will coincide with those from Georgia, while those from the Carolinas 
will occur during the third and fourth weeks of July. Wost of the shipments from 
California will be made during the last part of July and the first part of 
August . 

Shipments of the Georgia and Carolinas peach crop are marketed normally east of 
the jississippi River, but this year (as happened last year) some will probably 
move \jesp of the river and into Canada, Arkansas peaches are marketed largely 
in neighboring States, with most of California's shipments going to the West 
Coast States and States west of the jississippi River, 

Kidseason States will produce in 1946 an estimated 10,4 million bushels of peache 
as compared with 9,2 million bushels in 1945, and a 10-year average likewise of 
.9,2 million bushels. These States are close to, or include, centers of popula- 
tion and may not experience the same marketing problems as the other two groups 
of States, Transportation will be largely by truck. Peak production vdll be for 
the most part in August, 



The 1946 peach production for the late season States is estimated at 11.3 million 
bushels, as compared v.dth 12.7 million bushels in 1945 and a 10-year average 
production of 9,3 million bushels. These peaches will be harvested from about 
August 24 to September 20, and will be marketed largely in the upper third of 
the United States. 

It will require full- cooperation of brokers, the wholesale fruit and vegetable 
trade, and all retail outlets to keep these peaches moving into the hands of 
consumers as they come on the market. 

Peaches will be one fruit crop that will be plentiful for home and community - 
canning. In areas where home-grown supplies later are expected to be abundant, 
stress should be laid only on the fresh table use of early shipped-in peaches. 
Every effort must be made to secure the mximum use of peaches, both fresh and 
in home canning and community canning. The supply of commercially canned fruits 
will be insufficient to meet consumer demand during the coming year. 

Information concerning the point of peak supplies can be obtained locally from 
the Market News Office and from State P1IA Directors. 

Following -are pointers from the Bureau of Human nutrition & Home Economics:

peaches and cottage cheese are another good salad combination. 

Uhen serving fruit salads, be fat-thrifty. A small measure of table fat or mild- 
flavored drippings provides enough fat in a cooked dressing. Cream that sours 
in hot weather can be turned' to account. As a fat in homemade dressings', it is 
partiasLLarly good with fruit*

If peach shortcake is made with a biscuit dough, use half a biscuit to a serving, 
and conserve flour — instead of building a double-decker dessert. Or let a sub- 
stantial shortcake do duty as. a main part of a lunch or supper, and provide all 
the bread for the meal. 

Some people prefer shortcake made xdth sponge cake, which has the advantage this 
year of using no fat and very little x r heat flour. 

For a super summer dessert, make peach nelba by putting a scoopful of vanilla 
ice cream into the hollow of a peach half, ..pour a little raspberry sirup on t 
top... add a few chopped nuts. Or, let sliced peaches or peach sauce top a serv- 
ing of ice cream to rake a sundae. 

Three points on peach preparation: 

1. For easy peeling, dip peaches in boiling water a minute or two, then

Peaches are easy to can — they are safely canned in a boiling-water-bath canner. 
No steam pressure canner is needed. One bushel of peaches will yield about 18 
to 24 quarts. 

An average of 1 pound of sugar to 4 ^uarts of finished fruit is still the guide 
for home canning, in order to stretch limited sugar supplies to put up the most 
fruit. Suga*r for home canning this year is obtained by cashing spare ration ' 
stamp No. 9, which is good for 5 pounds for this purpose through October 31, 
1946. One additional stamp for 5 pounds or less is expected to be made good 
later in the canning season. 

To. stretch sugar in home canning, light-colored corn sirup may replace "up to 
one-third of the sugar, or mild-flavored honey up to one-half. Strong-flavored 
sirups or-bror/n sugar, or molasses should not be used. 

Sugar is not required to keep canned fruit from spoiling, but it is important 
for holding flavor, as well as texture and color. In an emergency a home canner 
can save fruit from wasting by putting up some without sugar, for use in salads 
or tart mixtures, or to be sweetened at serving if su~ar from the family ration 
is available, - .

■ Free z ing Peaches 

For the family that has a hone freezer or access to frozen storage locker space, 
freezing is a particularly good way to keep peaches. State e:<periment stations 
can advise on peach varieties from their regions, suited to freezing. 

One bushel of peaches, alloidhg for discards, yields about 38 pounds of frozen 
fruit. Peaches are best packed in a sugar sirup made in the proportion of 3 
cups of sugar to 4 cups of water. It takes about 3 gallons of sirup for 1 bushel 
of medium-sized peaches. 

To prevent peaches from darkening, either citric acid or ascorbic acid (vitamin 
2) is effective. Either may be bought at most drug stores. Up-to-date direc- 
tions for home freezing of fruits tell how to use..'- . 

H ome Drying 

Peaches are successfully dried in the oven; in a dehydrator; and in dry and sunny 
climates, out in the sun. Home drying requires no sugar, but some sweetening 
is generally wanted when dried fruit is served. 

Peach Spreads And Pickles 

If some canning 'sugar is used for sweet spreads, sugar thus used goes farthest 
in fruit butter, ^because the fruit pulp boils down and concentrates the natural 
sugar in the fruit. One pound of sugar will sweeten about 3 pints of peach 
butter . 

In jam and preserves, which ordinarily call for equal parts by weight of 'sugar 
and fruit, using three-fourths as much sugar is satisfactory, "Jith this, 1 
pound of sugar sweetens about 1-1/2 to 2 pints of jam. 

Pickles come last, since they generally use as much sugar as spreads, and the" 
spreads can replace table fat when served with breads. 

Community Food Preservation Centers 

llany homemakers will be able to use canning equipment at food preservation

Record Crop in 1947 

The 19A7 peach crop is expected .to.be -outstanding in quality and 
volume. The June 1st crop report of the Department estimated this 
year's production at 89,183,000 bushels, compared with 66,643,000 
bushels last year, 81,548,000 bushels in 1945, and a 10- year average 
of 63,000,000 bushels-. "• ,■' ■: • 

Most important producing areas are sharing in the;'; record crop. 
Peach production in the 10 leading Southern States is estimated at 
25,056,000 bushels 13 percent more than the. large 1946 crop. 

Spring freeze-. did some damage 'in a few "eastern '"'and midwestern pro- 
ducing States, but prospects in those areas as a whole are. for a 
relatively large crop. The Western States expect a record ' cre^-'-of 

44,398,000 bushels 1 percent more than the previous record ;iast 

year. A large part of the western crop is usually processed. How- 
ever, the volume available for fresh market purposes will depend, 
largely upon market conditions at time of harvest. 

In areas in which the southern crop is marketed "peaches will be' 
in abundant supply during the latter part of July and the first 
half of August. Northern and midwestern peaches will be plentiful 
during the latter half of August and early September.' , 

Marketings Delayed 

Marketing of the crop from the Southern States will be considerably 
later this year than last because of the cool spring weather 7an.dC 
late bloom. It is expected that the late portion of the Georgia 
crop will overlap the peak movement from the Carolinas and "Arkansas'. 

Georgia and Carolina peaches are marketed to a large extent east of 
the Mississippi River. With increased- movement ■,■ however, some '" 7 '' 
shipments will proably be marketed west of the Mississippi. < .. : 
.Arkansas peaches are marketed customarily in neighboring- States;,"" and 
the bulk of the California peaches go to West Coast States and. to 
States west of the Mississippi. Because the California season is 
early, however, shipments of California peaches may find their way 
to the eastern markets.

Cooperation Needed • '• • "• ' 

Full cooperation of shippers, brokers, receivers, and. distributors 
will be required to narkcb this yearns '-\?F©p effectively. 

How You May Help 

Producers: By packing and sending, to market only high quality 
peaches of uniform size and grade. Culls and overripe peaches 
should be left at home. 

Shippers, Distributors, and Receivers : By pushing the sale of 
peaches through available advertising and promotional media, and by 
tapping new retail outlets to assure no blind spots in distribution. 

Retailers : By the use of attractive displays and by efficient 
merchandising of peaches. Also by promoting the sale of peaches in 
normal advertising copy; by putting special emphasis on the 
desirability of peaches for home' use and canning. 

Commercial, Institutional, and Industrial Feeders; By featuring 
peaches, by serving them more often and in more ways. 

Associated and Allied Industries: By assisting in the promotion of 
peaches through all trade promotion and advertising media at their 
disposal. 

Homemakers; By serving more' peaches in more ways more often; by 
preserving and canning peaches during flush periods of production 
for later use; by using peaches in frozen desserts and in baking as 
often as possible/. 

Following are pointers from the Bureau 'of Human Nutrition and Hone 
Economics : 

Nutrition Note 

delicious flavor is reason enough for eating peaches. On the 
nutritive side, ,peaches at the peak of ripeness offer a fair amount 
qf vitamin C. In addition, yellow-fleshed poaches are a good source 
of vitamin A. 

To' make Good- Use of Peaches 

It's hard to beat peaches eaten the simplest ways... out of hand... 
sliced with cream or top milk. served as a fruit cup alone or with 
o.ther fruit. Sliced peaches and raspberries or blackberries, for 
example, are a combination to please both palate and eye. 

Keep ripe peaches cool until used. Spread them out to avoid bruis- 
ing. Let peaches that are a little on the. green side ripen at room 
temperature. 

To keep sliced peaches from turning dark and unattractive, either 
peel just before using,, or sprinkle the cut fruit with a little 
lemon juice.-. , «. , ' 

. : •• =•.: ' '(tiore-) - " 



Let sliced peaches top a bowl of cereal, hot or cold. 

Use chilled peaches in refreshing salads . . .halved peaches nesting 
in crisp lettuce, for example. .. some tines with cottage cheese or 
cream cheese or chopped fruit in the hollow of the peacfc half. Or 
combine peaches and other fruits','; crisp and cold, and cut in slices 
or good-sized diced pieces. A fruit salad fits anywhere in a meal; 
as a starter, with the main course, or as ,a dessert... For a warn 
weather lunch or supper, a generous fruit salad plate may need only 
bread or sandwiches and a beverage. ; 

In preparing peach salads, cream that sours in hot weather can be 
turned to account. Homemade dressings with sour cream as the fat 
ingredient are particularly good with fruit. 

For a cool summer dessert, make peach Melba by putting a 6<jocpful 
of vanilla ice cream into the hollow of a peach half...poui a 
little raspberry sirup ^n top. add a few chopped nuts.; - Or let 
sliced peaches or peach sauc-e top a serving of iqe cream to.. make a 
sundae. '". • . , ...» ; v \ •*■ 

A frozen dessert flavored like fresh peaches and smooth, as. velvet 
is Vclv'a Fruit. This is made by mashing peaches to a pulp and 
adding sugar and gelatin in the right proportions, then freezing. 
Directions for preparing' peaches arid other fruits in this way at 
hone are given in one> of the Department's printed pamphlets. The 
pamphlet also tells how to prepare the fruit puree for frozen 
storage, so that it ceri be made into a Velva Fruit dessert months 
later. 

Three points on peach preparation: 

1. For easy peeling, dip peaches in boiling water a minute or two, 
then quickly into 1 cold water'. Skins will slip easily. 

2. A pinch of salt adds to flavor in cooked fruit.. 

3. Cooking peaches in light sirup helps keep them firm. . , .. ' 

With stewed peaches try a dash of spice cinnamon, perhaps, or 

clove buds . . , , . . 

Broil or bake peach halves, pit . side. .up, in a shallow baking dish. 
To each piece add a little ..melted table fat, a very little salt, 
and sweetening if desired. When hot through and lightly browned, 
the peaches are ready to be served hot with the main course or as 
a dessert. '■ '"'"' '" ■" • " < 

Peach season wouldn't be complete without some of the old .favorites 
-- peach shortcake, pie, or cobbler. . Here .are some recipes, start- 
ing with the biscuit dough needed for" each dessert : 



(orer) 



Biscuit Dough for Peach Desserts 



2 cups sifted flour ■: / teaspoon salt 

3 teaspoons baking powder 3 to 6 tablespoons fat 
3/M cup silk, or enough for soft dough 

Sift dry ingredients and cut in the fat. Make a well in the 
mixture and add -the milk slowly and stir from the center with a 
fork until a soft dough is formed. Toss on a lightly floured board 
and use as directed. 

Peach Shortcake ' 

Bake biscuit dough in rounds in a hot oven (425° F.); split and 
- fill with sweetened sliced or chopped peaches'. Serve at once with 
or without crdam. 

Peach Cobbler 

Roll out- a rich biscuit, dough in- size to cover a baking dish. 
Slash the top. so it will let out the steam. Partly fill the dish 
with sweetened peaches and cover it with dough. Bake in a hot 
oven (400° F. ) until the crust is brown. If preferred, latticed 
strips, instead of a sheet of dough, may cover the fruit. 

Peach Turnover 

Cut biscuit dough in circles about the size of a saucer. On one 
side place chopped sweetened peaches. Fold over. Crimp the 
edges. Bake in a moderate oven (350 to 375° F.)« Serve plain or 
with sauce or cream. 

Putting Up the Peaches 

Peaches are successfully put up by a variety of home methods, 
and the peach products may be used many ways in good meals. 

Peaches chosen for home and community canning, freezing, drying or 
preserves should be table-ripe, firm, and perfect. The pink blush 
on many varieties of peaches tells little aboat quality. Back- 
ground color shows ripeness. When processes call for table-ripe 

fruit, choose peaches with yellow or yellow- white ground not 

green and put up the fruit promptly. 

Softer fruits, if sound, are good for peach butter or jam. Slight- 
ly underripe peaches make the best pickles. 

Freezing Peaches 

For the family that has a home freezer or access to frozen storage 
locker space, freezing is a particularly good way to keep peaches. 
State experiment stations can advise on peach .varieties from their 
regions that 'are suited to freezing.

One bushel of peaches,, allowing f or discards , yields about '3 8 " 
pounds of frozen fruLU: Peaches- are best packed in.- a sugar sirup 
made in the proportion of 3 cups of sugar to 4 cups of water. It 
takes about 3 gallons of sirup .f or 1 bushel of medium- sized peaches. 

To prevent peaches from darkening, either citric acid or ascorbic 
acid (vitamin C) is. ; ef f ectiy£.. ; ^El ther may be b'qufthtta-t ^^3f:/^ug

■ • Home Canning Peaches-. Hot, ,an<3, ,Baw Packs - •: . ••: - 

Peaches are easy to can they are safely canned in a boiling 

water bath canne.r. Nc. steam pressure canner, is needed for them. 
One bushel of peaches • will yield about 18 &0'2k quarts. 

Directions for packing peaches two ways either hot or cold. 

before processing in a water bath canner, are given by home canning 
specialists of the/Bureau of Human Nutrition, and -Home Economics.. 
Each method of packing has advantages: Th,e-:B6t pack is more 

economical of jar space about, one mor<©'; serving can be put into 

a quart jar than when peaches are packed raw/. Oh the other hand, 
raw-packed peaches hold shape better and look prettier in the jar 
; and on the table* .Tbere is some difference in flavor between •. 
peaches packed hot and cold, but apparently it is a matter of 
preference as to which product tastes better. 

Whichever way of packing is chosen, follow the accompanying 
directions from start to finish. Peaches not; heated sufficient- 
ly in home canning will not keep in storage. In .each case the 
time ^recommended, for processing peaches in the water bath canner 
is br.sed on the food being prepared and packed in the way Indicated. 

Here are directions for canning peaches recommended by the Bureau 
of Human Nutritisgi and Home. Economics'.: v. v ! I. ■ '• 

Wash peaches. Lip in boiling water, .then-.:.quickly : in cold water, to 
loosen skins. Remove s kins •.' ; ., Halve- and :-pl<t fruit. Slice, if de- 
sired. To prevent darkening", during preparation:, drop' peaches into 
water containing 2 tablespoons each of salt and vinegar per gallon. 
Drain just before heating or packing cold.; 

Hot Pack . Heat peaches through in hot sirup made by boiling ':' 

sugar and water or peach juice together 5 minutes. ,(A' thin sirup 
contains 1 cup sugar to 3 cups liquid; a medium sirup contains 
1,. cup sugar, to 2 cups liquid.) If peaches are very., juicy, they 

may be heated instead with dry sugar about l/2 cup to a quart 

of raw fruit letting the fruit come to a. boil ..over low heat. 

Pack hot fruit in hot glass jars to l/2 inch of top.- Cover with 
•boiling liquid, leaving- l/2 inch space at top of., jar. .Adjust jar 

lids. Process in boiling water bath either pint or quart jars 

,.-_jef peaches, 20 minutes. As soon as jars are removed from canner, 
complete seals if closures are not of self-sealing type. 



(more) 



Cold Pack . Prepare peaches as directed above. Pack raw fruit 

to - 1/2 inch of jar . top. Cover "with boiling- sirup, leaving 1/2 
inch space at '.topSof ■ jar. Ad just jar lids . ' "Process- In boiling 
water bath — pint jars of peaches, 25 minutes; quart jars, 35 
minutes. As soon as jars are removed from canner, complete seals 
if closures are not of self-sealing type. 

. Managing Su^ar in Drying Preserving. Pickling . 

Peaches are successfully dried in the oven, in a dehydrator, and in 
dry and sunny climates out in the sun. Home drying requires no 
sugar, but some sweet ening..; ; i si.gei^'ejiaily wanted when dried fruit is 
served. 

When makjjig sweet spreads-, sugar goes farthest in fruit butter be- 
cause the fruit- pulp boils' down and concentrates the natural sugar 
in the fruit. One pound of sugar will sweeten about three pints 
of peach butter. : 

.Jam and preserves ordinarily call for equal parts by weight of 
sugar and fruit. When stretching sugar supplies, using 3/k as much 
sugar as fruit is satisfactory. With this, 1 pound of sugar 
sweetens about 1-1/2 to 2 pints of jam. 

In pickling peaches, allow 2 pounds of sugar for 8 pounds of small 
or medium-sized fruit.

Community Food Preservation Centers 

Many homemakers will be able to use canning equipment 'at food 
preservation centers throughout the country. 

Besides canning done for a ' family , .many people give time tc can 

in groups for school lunches, hospitals, and' other community needs. 

Growers sometimes cooperate by donating suitable fruit. 

For information on starting or using a local food preservation 
center, ask Extension Service representatives or the State Depart- 
ment of Education at the 'State capitol. Information on establish- 
ing and operating community canning centers including directfone 

on processing peaches may be found in "Community Canning 

Centers," Miscellaneous Publication No. 544. Instructions on 

(more) 



processing peaches for community frozen-food locker plants are 
given In "Instructions on Processing fcr Community Frozen-Feed 
Locker Plants," Miscellaneous Publication No. 588. Copies of

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE 
Production and Marketing Administration 

July" 1947 

FA CT SHEE T ON PEACHES > - . - 

Record Crop in 1947 . 

The 1947 peach crop is expected to be outstanding in quality and volume. The 
June 1 crop report of the Department estimated this year's production at 
89,183,000 bushels, compared with 86,643,000 bushels last year ,■ 81,548,000 ; 
bushels in 1945, and a 10-year average of 63,000,000- bushels. 

Most important producing areas are sharing in the record crop. .Peach pro-- 
duct ion in the 10 leading Southern States is estimated at 25,056,000 bushels 
— 13 percent more than the large 1946 crop. ' t 

Spring freeze did some damage in a few eastern and midwest ern producing 
States, but prospects in those areas as a whole are for a relatively large 
crop. The Western States expect a record crop of.- 44,398,000 bushels — -I per-:, 
cent more than the previous record last year. A large part of the western 
crop is usually processed. However , • the volume available for fresh market 
purposes will, depend largely upon market conditions . at. time of harvest »■■■.• : 

In areas in which the southern crop is marketed peaches will be in abundant 
supply during the latter part of July and the first half of August. Northern 
and mid-western poaches will be plentiful during the latter half of August 
and ear ly September. 

Marketings' Delayed . 9 

Marketing of the crop from the Southern States will be considerably later thi 
year than last because of the cool spring weather and late bloom. It is ex- 
pected that the late portion of the Georgia crop will. overlap the peak move- 
ment from the Carolinas and Arkansas. 

Georgia' and. Carolina- peaches are marketed to, a largo extent east of tho 
Mississippi River.. With increased movement, however, some shipments will 
probably be marketed west of tho Mississippi. Arkansas, peaches are marketed 
customarily in neighboring States, and the bulk of the California peaches go 
to West Coast States and to States west of tho Mississippi. -Because of tho 
earlinoss.of the California- season, how ever, shipments of California peaches 
may find their way to tho eastern markets. 

Transportation Facilities ' 

Carlot shipments are expected to'be about equal to the heavy shipments of'-' 
last year, and railroads indicato that they will have enough cars and ice to 
handle, the tonnage. Crops closer to. the consuming centers will move by truck 
an adequate supply of containers is expected in :all producing -areas . 

Cooperation Needed •; • 

Full cooperation of shippers, brokers, receivers and distributors .will be 
required tc effectively market this year's .crop. ;. 0,

Hov; You May Help 



Producers ; By packing and sending to market only high quality peaches of 
uniform size and grade. Culls and overripe 'poaches . should be left at home* 

Shippers, Distributors, and Rec e ivers ? By pushing the sale of poaches ;< 
through available advertising . and promotional media, and by tapping new 
retail outlets to assure, no blind spots in distribution 

Retailers ; By the use of attractive displays and by efficient merchandising 
of peaches, also by promoting the sale of peaches in normal advertising 
copy; by putting special emphasis on the desirability of peaches for heme 
use and canning. 

Commercial. Institutional, and In d ustrial Fe'edcrs i ' By featuring peaches, by 
serving them more often and in more ways* 

Associ a ted .and Allied Industries : ' By assisting in the promotion of peaches 
through all trade pronotipn and advertising media at their disposal, 

Homemakers ; By serving more peaches "in more ways mere often; by preserving 
and canning poaches during flush periods of production foar later use; by 
using peaches in frozen desserts and in baking as often as possible. 

Following are pointers from the Bureau of Human' Nutrition and Home S-ccnomics: 

Nutrition Note 

Delicious flavor is reason enough for eating peaches. On the nutritive side, 
peaches at the peak of. ripeness offer .a fair amount of vitamin C. In additio: 
yolloy;-fleshed peaches are a good; source of vitamin a. '.' 

To Make Good Use of Peaches 

It's hard to beat peaches eaten the simplest ways... cut of hand. . *slicod with 
cream or top milk... .served as a fruit cup alone or vith' ether fruit. Sliced 
peaches and raspberries or blackberries,' for example, are a combination' to .. 
please both palate and eye. 

Keep ripe peaches cool until used. Spread them out to avoid bruising. Let 
peaches that are a little oh the green 'side ■ ripen at room temperature. 

To keep sliced peaches from turning dark and unattractive, either peel just 
beforo using, or sprinkle the cut fruit with a little lemon juice, , 

Let sliced peaches top a bowl of cereal, hot or cold. 

Use chilled peaches in refreshing salads. ; .halved peach-es nesting in crisp 
lottuco, for example, . .sometimes "with cottage cheese- or cream cheese or 
chopped fruit in the hollow of the peach half. Or combine peaches and other 
fruits, crisp and cold, and cut in slices or good-sizea diced pieces, .A 
fruit salad fits, anywhere in a meal: as a starter, with the main course, or 
as a dessert. For a warm weather lunch or supper,' a generous frUit salad 
plato may need only bread or sandwiches and u beverngo. - • " ' '•" 



fir 



In preparing poach salads, cream that sours in hot v/eather can be turned to 
account. Homemade dressings with sour cream a's the fat ingredient are parti- 
cularly good with fruit. . . 

For a cool summer dessert , make peach Melba by putting a sc'oopful .of vanilla 
ice cream into the hollow 'of a peach half... pour a little raspberry sirup on 
top. ..add a few chopped nuts. Or let sliced peaches or peach sauce top a " ' 
serving of ice cream to make a sundae. 

k frozen dessert flavored like fresh peaches and smooth as velvet is Velva 
Fruit. This is made by mashing peaches to a pulp and adding .sugar and 
gelatin in the right proportions, then freezing. Directions for preparing 
peaches and other fruits in this way at home arc given in. one of the Depart- 
ment's printed pamphlets. The pamphlet also tells how to prepare the fruit 
puree for frozen storage, so that it can be made into a Velva Fruit .dessert 
months later. 

Throo points 'on peach preparation: . 

1. For easy peeling, dip peaches in boiling water a minute or two, then 
quickly into cold water. Skins will slip easily. 

2. A pinch of salt adds to flavor in cooked fruit. 

3. 'Cooking peaches in light sirup helps keep them firm. 

With stowed peaches try a dash of spice — cinnamon, perhaps, or clove. buds. 

Broil or bake peach halves, pit side up, in a shallow baking dish. To each 
piece add a little melted table fat, a very little salt, and sweetening if" ' 
desired. When hot through and lightly browned, the peaches are ready to bo 
served hot with the main course or as a dessert .. 

Peach season wouldn't be complete without some of the old favorites peach 
shortcake, pie, or cobbler. Here are some recipes, starting with the biscuit 
dough needed for each dessert: 

Biscuit Dough for Peach Desserts 

2 cups sifted flour 3/4 teaspoon salt ' 

3 teaspoons baking powder f 3 to 6. tablespoons fat 
3/4 cup milk, or enough for spft dough . 

Sift dry ingredients and cut in the fat. Make a well in the mixture and 
add the milk slowly and stir from the center with a fork until a soft dough 
is formed. Toss on a lightly floured board and use as directed. • 

Peach Shortcake 

Bake biscuit dough in rounds in a hot oven (425° F.)$ split and fill with 
sweetened sliced or chopped peaches. Serve at once with or without cream. 



Peach Cobbler ■ •• ■ 

Roll out a rich biscuit dough in size to cover a baking dish. Slash the tip 
so it will let out the steam. Partly fill the dish with sweetened peaches 
and cover with the dough. Bake in a hot oven (400° F.) until the crust is 
brown. If ' preferred, latticed stripsy instead of a sheet of dough, may 
cover the fruit. 

Peach Turnover 

Cut biscuit dough in circles about the size of a saucer. On one side "place 
chopped sweetened peaches. Fold Over. Crimp' the edges* Bake in a moderate 
oven (350° to 375° F.). Serve plain or with sauco or cream, . 

Putting Up the Pe aches 

Peaches are successfully put up by a variety of home methods, and the peach 
products may be used many ways in good meals. ' 

Peaches chosen for home and community canning, freezing, drying, or pre-. . 
serves should be table-ripe,' firm, and perfect. The pink blush on many 
varieties of peaches tells little about quality. Background color shows 
ripeness. When processes call for table-ripe fruit, choose peaches with * 
yellow or yellow-white ground — not green — and put up the fruit promptly. 

Softer fruits, if sound, are g _, od for peach butter or jam. Slightly under- 
ripe poaches make the best' pickles. 

Freezing Peaches - : ' 

For the family that has a home freezer or access to frozen storage locker' 
space, freezing is a particularly good way to keep peaches. State experi- 
ment stations can advise on peach varieties from their regions that are 
suited to freezing. 

One bushel of peaches, allowing for discards, yields about 38 pounds of 
frozen fruit. Peaches are best packed in a sugar sirup made in the propor- 
tion of 3 cups of sugar to 4' cups of water. It takes about 3 gallons of 
sirup for 1 bushel of medium-sized peaches. 

To prevent peaches from darkening, either citric acid Or ascorbic acid 
(vitamin C) is effective. Either may be" bought at most drug stores. Up-' 
to-date directions for h^rne freezing of fruits toll how to use. 

Homo Canning Peaches. Hot and Row Pack s " 

Peaches are easy to can — they are safely canned in a boiling water bath 
canner. No steam pressure canner is noodod for them. Ore bushel of poaches 
will yield about 18 to 24 quarts. . .... 

Directions for packing poaches two ways — either hot or cold — before pro- 
cessing in a water bath canner, are given by homo canning specialists of the 
Bureau of Human Nutrition and Home Economics. Each method of packing has 
advantages: The hut pack is more economical of jar space — about one more 



-.5- «. 



serving can be put into a quart jar than when peaches are packed raw. On _ 
the other hand, raw-packed peaches hold shape better and look prettier in 
the jar and cn the table. There is • some difference; in. flavor between peaches 
packed hot. and cold, but apparently it is a natter of preference as to which 
product tastes better. • . i -. . .-. £•. 1 

Whichever way of packing is chosen, follow the accompanying directions, from 
start to finish. Peaches not heated sufficiently in hone canning will not 
keep in storage. Tines recommended for- processing peaches' in' the water bath 
canner are based on the food in each case being prepared and- packed as • indir 
cated. ' • ■ . . ; 

Here are directions for canning peaches recommended, by the Bureau of Human ' 
Nutrition and Home Economics: | • 

Wash peaches. Dip in boiling water, then quickly in. cold v.aterj to lo.cson., 
skins. Remove skins. Halve and pit fruit. Slice, if desired. To prevent 
darkening during preparation, drop, peaches into water containing 2 tablespoons 
each of salt and vinegar per gallon. Drain just, before heating or packing >. » 
cold. 

Hot Pack . i — Heat peaches through in hot sirup made by. boiling sugar and 
water or peach juice together 5 minutes, {k thin sirup contains 1 pup sugar . ; 
to 3 cups liquid; a medium sirup contains 1 cup sugar to 2 cups liquid.) 
If peaches are very juicy, they may be heated ■ instead -with- dry . sugar — about ., 
l/2 cup to a quart of raw f ruit--lett ing the fruit come,. .to a boil over , low, 
heat,. -. ' • . . ; -. : -. ■ • ■ 

Pack hot fruit in hot glass jars to-' 1/2 inch o-f. top'. Cover with boiling- 
liquid, leaving l/2. inch space ; at- top of jar. Adjust jar lids. Process- • 
ih boiling water- bath — either pint or quart jars of peaches, .2.0 .minutes,.; • 
As soon as jars are removed from canner, complete seals if closures are. -net ... • 
of self-sealing type. .. j j' : 

Cold Pack . — Prepare peaches as directed above. Pack raw fruit to l/2 

inch of jar top. Cover with boiling sirup, leaving l/2 inch space at top 

of jar. Adjust jar lids. Process in boiling water bath — pint jars of peaches, 

25 minutes; quart jars, 35 minutes. As soon as jars are removed from canner, 

complete seals if closures are not of self-sealing type. 

Managing Sugar in Drying. Preservin g. Pickling . 

Peaches are successfully dried in the oven, in a dehydrator, and in dry 
and sunny climates out in the sun. Home drying requires no sugar, but some 
sweetening is generally wanted when dried fruit is served.' 

When making sweet spreads, sugar goes farthest in fruit butter because tho 
fruit pulp boils down and concentrates the natural sugar in the fruit. 
One pound of sugar will sweeten about 3 pints of peach butter. 

Jam and preserves ordinarily call for equal parts by weight of sugar and 
fruit. When stretching sugar supplies, using 3/4 as much sugar as fruit is 
satisfactory. With this, 1 pound of sugar sweetens about If to 2 pints of 
jam. 

In pickling peaches, allow 2 pounds of sugar for 8 pounds of small or medium- 
sized fruit.

Many homemake'rs will be able to use canning equipment at food preservation 
centers throughout the country. 

Besides canning done for a family, many people give tine- to can in groups for 
school lunches, hospitals-, and other community needs. Growers seme tines ■ 
cooperate by donating suitable fruit. 

For information on starting or using a l'ecal food preservation center, ask 
Extension Service representatives or the State Department of Education at the 
State capital. Information en establishing and operating community canning 1 
centers — including directions on processing peaches — nay be fcund in
