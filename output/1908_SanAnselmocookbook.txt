Creamed Eggs (President McKinley's favorite dish) 
Melt some butter in a saucepan; when melted add onehalf 
teaspoonful of Tobasco sauce, same quantity of salt, pepper 
and nutmeg are added; two pints of cream are then poured 
into the pan ; then the whole is carefully stirred until it 
comes to a boil; then the eggs are poached in the boiling 
cream. (It must be cream, remember, not milk.) Serve on 
toast. Mrs. P. A. M. 

Omelet Separate three eggs; beat whites to a stiff 
froth; beat yolks. Heat half a cup of milk to it; add one 
teaspoonful of cornstarch or flour ; then stir in the yolks and 
add lightly the whites of the eggs. Put a good-sized piece 
of butter into a frying pan. When hot pour in the mixture, 
cover and cook from five to seven minutes ; when set remove 
the cover and place pan in oven to brown the omelet. Serve 
on hot platter. 

A Delicious Omelet To make a dainty omelet requires 
care in the details of mixing the ingredients. The follow- 
ing of these directions closely will result in a rich golden 
tponge instead of the usual thin, feathery mass. Fresh 
eggs are absolutely essential. Take four eggs, four table- 
spoonfuls of water, one-eighth of a spoonful of white pepper 
and salt. Separate the eggs and beat the whites to a stiff 
froth; beat the yolks, add the water and beat again. Put 
one tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan and while it is 
heating carefully stir the yolks into the beaten whites, add- 
ing the seasoning. Pour into the hot frying pan and when 
the underside is a delicate brown place in a hot oven to set 
the top. The moment it is done loosen the edges from the 
pan with a knife, fold over and serve on a hot platter garn- 
ished with sprigs of parsley and delicately cut and fried 
slices of bacon. Never beat and mix the eggs and allow 
them to stand for even five minutes before cooking. Do 
not slam the oven door shut, for the jar will cause the omelet 
to fall. To make fancy omelets spread the top, before fold-

Halibut a la Creole Take a slice of fish weighinsr about 
four pounds, and use also a pint of stewed tomatoes, a cupful 
of water, a slice of onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, three 
cloves and one tablespoonful of flour. Put the tomato, 
water, cloves and onion to boil. Mix the butter and flour 
and stir into the sauce, when it boils. Add a teaspoonful 
of salt and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, and after 
cooking for ten minutes, rub through a strainer into a bowl. 
Pour into a deep plate, boiling water to the depth of half 
an inch, and lay the fish in it for half a minute, black side 
clown. Remove it from the water and the black substance 
can readily be scraped off. Wash the halibut in cold water 
and season it well with salt and pepper. Place a tin sheet 
in a small, shallow pan and lay the fish on it. If you have 
no sheet, lay the fish on the bottom of the pan, but this 
should be avoided if possible, because the fish cannot be 
easily removed whole after it has been cooked. Pour into 
the pan about half of the tomato sauce, and then set in a 
hot oven. Cook the fish for three-quarters of an hour, bast- 
ing three times with the remainder of the tomato sauce. At 
serving time slide the halibut from the tin sheet upon a hot 
dish and pour over it the sauce remaining in the pan. Serve 
hot. M. P.

An Excellent Luncheon Dish Take the contents of one

skin and bones, and separate in flakes. If the canned pro- 
duct is used, first rinse very thoroughly with hot water. Mix 
one tablespoonful of flour, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of mustard and a few grains of cayenne. Add 
one egg slightly beaten, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and three- 
fourths of a cupful of milk. Cook in a double boiler until 
the mixture thickens like a soft custard, stirring constantly 
at first and afterward occasionally. Remove from the 
range and add three-fourths of a tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gelatine soaked in two tablespoonfuls of cold water. 
Strain the mixture, add to the fish and turn into individual 
moulds or a brick mold. Chill thoroughly and remove from, 
the mould to a serving dish. Serve on a bed of lettuce.

up, and then pour them on the slices of toast, which should 
be arranged on a warm platter. Serve at once. This is. 
the simplest way to prepare oysters. They can be cooked 
at the table in a chafing-dish. M. P.

oysters; parboil and drain. Melt half a cup of butter; add 
half a cup of flour and stir until smooth and brown; then-

teacupful of grated bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, one teaspoonful of mixed mustard, one-fourth of a 
teaspoonful of pepper, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of celery

Mrs. J. R. Meek, Marysville. 

Ragout of Beef For eight persons, two pounds of beef 
from the round, three tablespoonfuls of flour, one pint of

inch .hick and long enough to thoroughly cover ham; encase 



52 RECIPES FOR COOKING 

the ham in dough and pinch edges together; support the 
ham a little way from the bottom of the pan to prevent the 
dough from burning. This may be accomplished by placing 
a perforated pie pan inverted in the bottom of the pan in 
which the ham is to be baked. Place the ham on this pie 
pan, then pour in sufficient water almost to reach the top 
of the pie pan, but not to come in contact with the dough in 
which the ham is encased. Bake in moderate oven until 
the dough cracks open ; remove dough and skin ; return to 
baking pan ; add to water in pan half a bottle of good white 
wine, one bay leaf and a tablespoonful of sugar; bake an- 
other hour, frequently basting. Stand in liquor until cold. 

Mrs. R. Leach. 

Fried Ham Fried ham will be as tender as chicken if 
cooked in this way : Wipe a slice of ham with a cloth wrung 
out of cold water, and cut off half of the outside layer of 
fat. Put in an iron frying pan, cover with tepid water, and 
let stand on the back of the range thirty minutes, not allow- 
ing the water to reach a higher temperature than at first. 
Drain the ham and dry on a towel. Heat the frying pan, 
put in the ham and brown quickly on one side, then turn 
and brown on the other side, the time required being about 
three minutes. Remove to a heated platter and serve at 
once. L. M. 

Mark Hanna Hash Brown in a saucepan two onions

Make into a loaf and bake, basting as you do with other 
meats. Use one pound of pork chopped fine, with beef, not 
with veal. If pork is used omit the salt. 

Meat Pie 'With Potato Crust Take .cold meat and half 
fill a baking dish to suit size of family. Put sliced meat into 
a stewpan with any gravy that you have, a lump of butter 
and a bit of sliced onion ; thicken it by dredging in* a table- 
spoonful of flour ; cover it up on the fire where it may stew 
gently, but not be in danger of burning. Meanwhile there 
must be boiled a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill baking 
dish after the stewed meat has been transferred to it. The 
potatoes must be mashed and beaten up with milk and but- 
ter, then place a thick layer of potatoes on top of the meat, 
brush it over with egg, place the dish in over and let it 
brown. Have a good quantity of gravy left with the meat 
that the meat may not be dry and tasteless. Serve with to- 
mato sauce. Any kind of left over vegetables may be used 
before adding potatoes. This is a good plain dish.

Pies and Pastry 



To make quick paste sift into mixing bowl three level cup- 
fuls of flour. Chop into this, with a stiff spoon, one level 
cupful of lard; add salt to taste and moisten with ice water. 
Stir vigorously for a half minute only, turn out upon a 
floured board and pat gently into shape with the rolling-pin,, 
not allowing the hands to come into contact with the dough. 
Lastly roll out as thin as desired and if pastry cups are to 
be made place the little patee pans so that each one may 
have a small margin around it; cut out the circles with a 
sharp knife. An excellent and quick method is to invert the 
patee pans and cover the outside with the pastry. 

Mrs. Richard Leach. 

Pie Crust Three cups of sifted flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one and one-half cups of lard and half of a cup of 
ice water. Mix the flour and the salt and lard quickly and 
lightly together with the tips of the fingers. Pour in the 
water slowly, mixing all the time with a silver fork. Let 
stand for some hours in the ice chest. This will make two 
pies. Cut into four pieces. When ready for use, take out 
one piece onto a well-floured board ; dust well with flour and 
roll quickly with a well-floured rolling pin until perfectly 
round and large enough to fit the pie pan. Lay on the pan, 
fill with sugared fruit, wet the edges of the crust, cutting 
off rim that falls over the sides ; roll out the upper crust, fold 
it over; slit it four times with a sharp knife; lay over the 
fruit. Wet the top well with water. Pinch together the 
crust on the sides and bake in a rather quick oven. Always 
add a teaspoonful of flour mixed with the sugar to any juicy 
fruit, such as currants or blackberries, to each pie, and as 
much sugar as fruit. Mrs. C. R. Gagan. 

Banana Pie Bake a good-sized pie shell. Place a layer 
of sliced bananas, then a layer of filling, then a layer of 
bananas, and then a frosting made of two whites of eggs 
beaten stiff and one-fourth of a cup of sugar, flavored with 
lemon. Brown nicely in oven.

Pickles, Jellies, Preserves 



About Pickles and Preserves In making preserves the 
following are excellent rules to observe: 1. The fruit must 
be gathered dry. 2. It must be carefully stirred with a 
wooden spoon to prevent burning. 3. It must be slowly boiled 
before adding sugar, and quickly boiled afterward. 4. It 
must be put in well-dried pots, and kept in a dry, airy place. 

To Pickle Beets To pickle beets, wash the roots very 
clean, but do not scrape them ; put them into boiling water, 
and keep them boiling from two to three hours, till perfectly 
tender. Take them out and let them remain till cold, then 
pare and slice the root, cover it with vinegar which has been 
boiled and cooled, and in which a teaspoonful of salt and 
half the quantity of cayenne has been boiled. Put the pickle 
into jars, and in a few days it will be fit for use. 

Red Currant Preserve In making red currant preserve 
be sure to remember that to every pound of fruit you allow 
three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar. Weigh the cur- 
rants, and afterwards strip them from the stalks (do this 
with a fork to prevent staining the hands). Place fruit and 
sugar in preserving pan, and boil for about three-quarters 
of an hour. 

Brine To make brine, take a proportion of one quart 
of rock salt to three quarts of boiling water. Boil and strain.

taste is removed. The olives are then put into cold water, 
which should be changed twice daily, until all taste of the

indefinitely. M. H.

FOR THE SICK 



Arrowroot Water Moisten one teaspoonful of arrow- 
root with cold water; smooth into a paste; add one pint of 
boiling water and boil five minutes, stirring continuously. 

Barley Water Wash in cold water two ounces of pearl 
barley. Boil five minutes, then drain. Pour on two quarts 
of boiling water and boil down to a quart. Flavor with 
thinly cut lemon rind; add sugar to taste; strain only at 
patient's request. 

Beef Juice Cut thin juicy meat into pieces one and one- 
^half inches square ; boil one and one half minutes over a hot 
fire. Squeeze with a hot lemon squeezer ; season with salt 
and pepper. May be added to milk or poured over toast. 

Beef Extract Heat a select piece of round steak so that 
the juice may be freely pressed. Cut steak into pieces that 
will fit into a lemon squeezer and squeeze into a cup. Set 
cup into a dish of hot water which must not be allowed to 
boil. Season to taste. May be served on toast. 

Beef Tea Free a pound of lean beef from fat, skin, etc. 
Chop up fine. Put in a pint of cold water to digest two 
hours. Simmer for three hours, but do not let it boil. Make 
up the water lost by adding cold water. Press and strain. 
The best meats for beef tea are the round and rump. Cold 
water draws out the albumen; boiling water coagulates it. 

Scraped Beef Sandwich From a piece of steak scrape 
all the fibre from the connective tissue with a knife. Season 
with salt and pepper. Serve between slices of buttered toast. 

Clam Broth Take several large clams; scrub them 
clean and boil in a cup of water. The broth is simply the 
juice of the clams with the water, boiled for a minute or two. 
As soon as the shells open the broth is done. .

Mrs. P. Lemon. 

White of Egg Lemonade For this drink use : Two lem- 
ons, whites of two eggs, one pint of boiling water, loaf sugar 
to taste. The lemons must be peeled twice, the yellow rind 
alone being used; the white layer is rejected. Place the 
sliced lemon and the yellow peel in a quart jug with two 
lumps of sugar; pour on them the boiling water and stir 
occasionally. When cooled to about the ordinary tempera- 
ture of tea, strain off the lemons. Now insert an egg whisk

Junket Heat half a pint of fresh milk. Add a tea- 
spoonful of essence of pepsin; stir enough to mix. Pour 
into custard Clips and let stand until firm. Serve plain or 
powder with sugar or nutmeg. 

Koumiss One tablespoonful of sugar in a quart of fresh 
milk. Dissolve one-fifth of a cake of yeast in a little cold 
water; then stir it into the milk. Put the mixture into* 
strong patent stopped bottles. Shake the bottles for one 
minute, then stand them on end in a refrigerator or other- 
cool place. After three days place the bottles on their 
sides, and turn them occasionally. Five days will be re- 
quired to perfect the fermentation. 

To Peptonize Milk Pepsin grs. xx; Cold water zu;: 
milk oj. Directions Place the contents of one of the vials 
into a well cleaned quart bottle. Pour upon it a gill of cool, 
water and shake the mixture thoroughly. Then add to- 
the mixture a pint of fresh milk and place the bottles in a 
vessel containing water as hot as can be borne by the hand 
without discomfort. Let it stand, with occasional shaking,., 
from ten to twenty minutes, or until it has acquired a slight- 
ly bitter taste, when it should be removed from the hot 
water and placed upon ice or in a cool place, to check di- 
gestion and keep from spoiling. If not quickly cooled the- 
digestion will continue and the milk becomes too bitter to- 
be palatable. Milk thus peptonized may be sweetened if the- 
patient desires it. It may also be flavored with wine or 
rum as desirable. 

Cold Process This consists in adding to the milk the- 
peptonizing powder as above, using cool water and milk, and 
then placing the mixture upon the ice without warming it 
at all. 

N. B. If it be found that the milk ferments after fol- 
lowing the above directions, boil the milk first, let cool and 
then peptonize. The bacteria in uncooked milk cause fer- 
mentation when pepsin is added. 

Lime Water Into two quarts of water place a lump of 
unslaked lime the size of an egg. After standing awhile,. 
stir thoroughly and pour off the solution; add fresh water 
and keep covered.

Milk and Lime Water Milk and lime water are now 
frequently prescribed by physicians in cases of dispepsia and 
weakness of the stomach, and in some cases are said to be 
beneficial. Many persons who think good bread and milk: 
a great luxury, frequently hesitate to eat it, for the reason 
that the milk will not digest readily; sourness of the stomach 
will often follow. But experience shows that lime water 
and milk are not only food and medicine at an early period 
of life, but also at a later, when, as in the case of infants, 
the functions of digestion and assimilation are feeble and 
easily perverted. A stomach taxed by gluttony, irritated 
by improper food, inflamed by alcohol, enfeebled by disease, 
or otherwise unfitted for its duties as is shown by the vari- 
ous symptoms attendant upon indigestion, dyspepsia, 
diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever will resume its work, and 
do it energetically, on an exclusive diet of bread and milk, 
and lime water. A goblet of milk may have four tablespoon- 
fuls of lime water added to it with good effect. The way to 
make lime water is simply to procure a few lumps of un- 
slaked lime, put the lime in a stone jar, and add water until 
the lime is slaked and of about the consistence of thin cream ; 
the lime settles, leaving the pure and clean lime water on top. 

Milk Lemonade A tablespoonful of sugar, juice of one 
lemon, two tablespoonfuls of sherry, half a cup of milk and 
half a cup of water. 

Milk Punch Cup of milk and two tablespoonfuls of 
brandy. Sweeten to taste. Grated nutmeg may be added. 

Lemon Whey One cup of boiling milk, one pound of 
sugar and one-fourth of a cup of lemon juice. Sweeten 
milk; pour lemon juice into hot milk and let stand until 
curds separate from whey. Strain. Serve hot or cold. 

Mrs. P. Lemon.. 

Imperial Lemonade One lemon, three pounds of sugar, . 
one cup of water and half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Boil sugar, water and thin slices of lemon rind together five 
minutes ; when cold add lemon juice and last of all the cream 
of tartar, which has been dissolved in a little hot water. 
Serve at once. Mrs. P. Lemon.

Oyster Broth Chop a dozen oysters fine, put into a 
saucepan with a cup of cold water. Bring to a boiling point, 
simmer five minutes, then strain and season. By adding 
milk three minutes before the broth is taken, from the fire 
It is made more palatable. 

Scalloped Oysters Clean oysters, roll crackers and mix 
"with melted butter. Sprinkle dish with crumbs, then place 
a layer of oysters and a layer of crumbs, another layer of 
oysters, and so on until all are used. Bake in a hot oven. 

Oatmeal Water A teaspoonful of oatmeal to a quart 
of water. Boil down to a pint and strain. 

Oatmeal Gruel Two tablespoonfuls of rolled oats, a 
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of sugar and a cup of -boil- 
ing milk. Mix oatmeal, sugar and salt ; add boiling water ;

Oysters on the Half Shell Wash the shells and put them 
on hot coals or upon the top of hot stove, or bake in a hot 
oven. Open shells, taking care not to lose any of the liquor. 
Serve at once on hot plates with toast. 

To Boil Clams Wash shells clean, and put the clams 
{the edges downward) in a kettle; pour about a quart of 
boiling water over them. Cover the pot, and set it over a 
brisk fire for forty-five minutes. The boiling water will 
open the shells quickly and let out the sand. When done 
remove the black skin which covers the hard part, trim 
clean, and put into a stewpan. Add some of the liquor in 
which they were boiled, and a large piece of butter ; pepper 
and salt to taste ; serve hot. 

Panada Two Boston soda or graham crackers, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of salt. Put creckers in bowl 
with sugar and salt between them. Pour over just enough 
boiling water to soak well. Put bowl into vessel of boiling 
water and let stand fifteen or twenty mintues; lift crackers 
out clear but not broken. Serve with cream. This is very 
good for babies of eight months or so. Mrs. P. Lemon.

For Sick Stomach The following drink for relieving 
sickness of the stomach is said to be very palatable and 
agreeable : Beat up one egg very well, say for twenty min- 
utes, then add fresh milk one pint, water one pint, sugar to 
make it palatable ; boil, and get it cool ; drink when cold. 
If it becomes curds and whey it is useless. . 

Toast for an Invalid When food for an invalid is to 
be served on toast, fix it this way : After removing the crust, 
cut the toast lengthwise into half-inch strips and then cut 
-crosswise, so as to form small squares. Push these squares 
gently together so that the slice appears whole once more, 
and then place on it a poached egg or creamed chicken. A 
convalescent, too weak to use both hands at once, needs only 
the aid of a fork to enable him to eat such a meal in perfect 
comfort. Mrs. R. Leach. 

Stuffed Baked Potato Select a smooth potato; scrub 
well, and bake in a hot oven about fifty minutes. Cut one 
end partly off lengthwise ; scrape out the potato into a dish ; 
add pepper, salt and butter, refill the skin, place a bit of 
butter in the top and brown in the oven. 

Poached Egg Pour hot water (or milk) in a saucepan, 
using a saltspoonful of salt to each cup of water. Bring to 
boiling point. Break egg into a saucer and slip into the 
pan. Withdraw the pan to a cooler part of the stove and 
cook until white of egg is set.

Rice Take desired quantity of rice and wash three times 
in cold water, rubbing the rice carefully between the hands ; 
then drain. Boil fresh water slowly. Put in the rice and 
cover the vessel closely. Cook over a slow fire about twelve 
minutes, when grain should be perfect and separated. Drain 
in a colander. When dry put rice in oven to heat.

Wine Whey Put two pints of milk into a saucepan and 
place on the fire. When about to boil add two wineglasses 
of sherry. Simmer fifteen minutes, skimming off the curds 
as they rise. Add a teaspoonful of sherry. Skim again and 
strain through clean linen ; if preferred two tablespoonfuls 
of lemon juice may be added instead of wine. 

Whey To half a pint of warm milk add one teaspoon- 
ful of essence of pepsin, liquid pepsin or liquid rennet. After 
the mixture forms beat it with a fork and strain off the whey. 

Water Wafers Quart of sifted flour, half a pint of cold 
water, teaspoonful of salt; mix thoroughly. Roll out thin

Albumen Water Break the white of an egg into a bowl. 
Beat until it commences to froth, then add gradually a cup- 
ful of water, beating contimially. Set away in a cool place. 
This is very nourishing and will stay on the weakest stomach 
when all other things fail. It is almost tasteless, but may 
be made more palatable by adding the juice of one orange. 

Mrs. Everman. 

Barley Water (To substitute for milk in case of vom- 
iting, etc.) Two teaspoonfuls of pearl barley to one pint of 
cold water. Let simmer about an hour. Pour off and 
strain. Mrs. Everman. 

Whey for Babies Add sodium bicarbonate gr. x to half 
a pint of whey to render it alkaline; and sugar of milk zi. 
to raise the sugar to six per cent. 

Custard Put three-fourths of a cup of milk into 
a double boiler top, and have the water boiling underneath. 
Separate the white and yolk of one egg. Beat the white 
np, adding a tiny pinch of salt. Add a scant tablespoonful 
of sugar to the yolk and beat it well. As soon as the milk 
is scalded, pour a small quantity into the beaten yolk and 
stir well. Add the remainder of the milk, a little at a time, 
and beat all well. Then stir the beaten white in and pour 
into the double boiler top, and set in the boiling water again. 
Stir constantly until it thickens a little and pour off imme- 
diately. This is a very safe recipe and makes about two 
small cupfuls. Mrs. Everman. 

Beef juice Partly broil a piece of juicy steak about the 
size of a small dinner plate. Cut into small pieces and press 
the juice from them in a meat press. Pour into a granite 
cup and set in hot water to warm. Do not allow it to be- 
come more than hike-warm, as too much heat will cause a 
curd to form. Break a little bread into this (whole wheat 
bread is always preferable) and add a tiny pinch of salt. 
This is much quicker to prepare than beef tea and has the 
same value. Mrs. Everman.

Miscella n eous 



Colic in Infants Infants are very subject to colic from 
overfeeding, too early feeding, constipation and many other 
causes. They often suffer terribly from these pains, tossing 
about, drawing up their legs, and screaming vehemently. 
Treatment When it arises from costiveness, a teaspoonful 
or tablespoonful of castor oil will often remove the defect, 
and at or about the same time give three drops of essence 
of peppermint or spearmint, in a little sweetened water. A 
very little salaratus often gives relief, and paregoric in two 
to five-drop doses every hour, will give relief. Hot flannels 
applied over the bowels and stomach are useful, and often 
the infant can be greatly relieved by laying it upon the belly 
on the knee, trotting it and gently tapping its back; this 
must be done cautiously, for if unsuccessful it might increase 
tlie pains. 

Pare a fresh lemon very carefully, without breaking the 
thin, white, inside skin, put it inside a wild duck and keep it 
there for forty-eight hours, and all the fishy taste, so disa- 
greeable in wild fowls, will be removed. The lemon should 
be removed, and a fresh one put in its place as often as every 
twelve hours. A lemon thus prepared will absorb unpleas^ 
ant flavors from almost all meat or game. 

To flavor a roast of beef deliciously, to make it tender, 
and to give variety which is essential in that family where 
beef is the staple meat eaten to do all this, nothing more 
is required than a large lemon ; cut it in two pieces, squeeze 
all the juice upon the roast, then, after peeling the lemon, 
roll it up in the roast.. When the lemon is used, no water 
is needed. The roast should be a fat one, to insure good 
gravy, and the lemon acid will remove the oily taste some- 
times objected to. 

To many housewives the curtains are a source of con- 
tinual worry. The best way to wash them is as follows: 
Wash thoroughly in hot suds and wring out the water with 
the hands. Rinse in blue water and squeeze again (always 
use the hands). Next wring through some starch. Shake 
out well and stretch. Pin quite flat on a clean sheet and

leave to dry on the floor of a seldom-used room. Leave till 
nearly dry, and iron with hot iron, then they are ready for 
use. If they are hung up rather damp they dry in nice 
straight folds. 

If you wish to shut off any view through a window you 
can do it very cheaply in the following manner: Dissolve 
in a little hot water as much Epsom salts as the water will 
absorb. Paint this over the inside of the window. When 
dry you will have a fair imitation of ground glass. 

Young housekeepers are sometimes unacquainted with 
the difference between a tea-cloth and a duster. Tea-cloths 
; should be of linen, and about a yard long, and of a darker 
and coarser texture than glass-cloths, which should be fine, 
white and free from that downy substance which is in some 
kinds of material, and which would stick to the glass and 
prevent its looking bright and clean. Dusters should be 
of blue checked stuff for use in the kitchen, and of white 
linen for the other rooms in the house. 

When working in the kitchen, protect your dress and 
apron by wearing a square of thin oilcloth. To make it 
quite neat, bind it with braid, and attach strings to the up- 
per corners. This needs only to be washed off when soiled, 
and can be discarded in a second if there is a ring at the 
door-bell. 

Meat will keep in the hot weather for many days if it 
is hung in a current of air and covered with a muslin which 
has been wrung out in vinegar. This should be renewed 
every day. 

If you wish to stick anything and have no blue in the 
'house, try the following recipe : Take a small piece of cold 
potato which has been boiled, and rub it up and down on a 
piece of paper with your fingers for about five minutes. It 
will become the right consistency, and stick as well as the 
strongest glue. 

To Prevent Spotting A teaspoonful of black pepper 
will prevent gray or buff linens from spotting, if stirred into 
the first water in which they are washed. It will also pre- 
vent the colors running, when washing black or colored

cambrics or muslins, and the water is not injured by it, but 
just as soft as before the pepper was put in. 

Never boil nice white goods. They should be only 
scalded. Mrs. P. A. M. 

To iron embroidery nicely, press it on the wrong side,

In removing grease spots by benzine, the stained outline 
which. is left can be prevented by the application of gypsum, 
extending a little beyond the moistened region. When dry, 
shake the powder off, and no trace of the spot will remain. 

To Remove Bruises From Furniture Wet the bruised 
spots with warm water. Soak a piece of brown paper of 
several thicknesses in warm water, and lay over the place. 
Then apply a warm flat-iron until the moisture is gone. Re- 
peat the process if needful, and the bruises will disappear.

teaspoonful of Tobasco sauce, same quantity of salt, pepper 
and nutmeg are added; two pints of cream are then poured

them to stand for even five minutes before cooking. Do.

Halibut a la Creole Take a slice of fish weighing about 
four pounds, and use also a pint of stewed tomatoes, a cupful 
of water, a slice of onion, two tablespoonfuls of butter, three 
cloves and one tablespoonful of flour. Put the tomato, 
water, cloves and onion to boil. Mix the butter and flour 
and stir into the sauce, when it boils. Add a teaspoonful 
of salt and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, and after 
cooking for ten minutes, rub through a strainer into a bowl. 
Pour into a deep plate, boiling water to the depth of half 
an inch, and lay the fish in it for half a minute, black side 
down. Remove it from the water and the black substance 
can readily be scraped off. Wash the halibut in cold water 
and season it well with salt and pepper. Place a tin sheet 
in a small, shallow pan and lay the fish on it. If you have 
no sheet, lay the fish on the bottom of the pan, but this 
should be avoided if possible, because the fish cannot be 
easily removed whole after it has been cooked. Pour into 
the pan about half of the tomato sauce, and then set in a 
hot oven. Cook the fish for three-quarters of an hour, bast- 
ing three times with the remainder of the tomato sauce. At 
serving time slide the halibut from the tin sheet upon a hot 
dish and pour over it the sauce remaining in the pan. Serve 
;hot. M. P. 

Holland Herring Soak all night; take off heads and

An Excellent Luncheon Dish Take the contents of one

skin and bones, and separate in flakes. If the canned pro- 
duct is used, first rinse very thoroughly with hot water. Mix 
one tablespoonful of flour, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of mustard and a few grains of cayenne. Add 
one egg slightly beaten, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of" 
melted butter, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and three- 
fourths of a cupful of milk. Cook in a double boiler until 
the mixture thickens like a soft custard, stirring constantly 
at first and afterward occasionally. Remove from the 
range and add three-fourths of a tablespoonful of granu- 
lated gelatine soaked in two tablespoonfuls of cold water. 
Strain the mixture, add to the fish and turn into individual 
moulds or a brick mold. Chill thoroughly and remove from 
the mould to a serving dish. Serve on a bed of lettuce.

at the table in a chafing-dish. M. P.

which the ham is to be baked. Place the ham on this pie 
pan, then pour in sufficient water almost to reach the top 
of the pie pan, but not to come in contact with the dough in 
which the ham is encased. Bake in moderate oven until 
the dough cracks open; remove dough and skin; return to 
baking pan ; add to water in pan half a bottle of good white 
wine, one bay leaf and a tablespoonful of sugar; bake an- 
other hour, frequently basting. Stand in liquor until cold.

let stand on the back of the range thirty minutes, not allow- 
ing the water to reach a higher temperature than at first, 
Drain the ham and dry on a towel. Heat the frying pan, 
put in the ham and brown quickly on one side, then turn

three minutes. Remove to a heated platter and serve at 
once. L. M.

fill a baking dish to suit size of family. Put sliced meat into 
a stewpan with any gravy that you have, a lump of butter 
and a bit of sliced onion ; thicken it by dredging in a table- 
spoonful of flour ; cover it up on the fire where it may stew 
gently, but not be in danger of burning. Meanwhile there 
must be boiled a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill baking 
dish after the stewed meat has been transferred to it. The 
potatoes must be mashed and beaten up with milk and but- 
ter, then place a thick layer of potatoes on top of the meat, 
brush it over with egg, place the dish in over and let it 
brown. Have a good quantity of gravy left with the meat 
that the meat may not be dry and tasteless. Serve with to- 
mato sauce. Any kind of left over vegetables may be used 
before adding potatoes. This is a good plain dish.

Crust Five cups of macaroni flour and two eggs. Beat 
eggs and add to flour already moistened with water. Mix 
and add more water until you have a stiff dough. Divide 
dough in two. Roll out into separate large thin crusts, 
being careful to get them as thin as possible, but not break- 
ing them. Spread one crust and then put a thin layer of 
filling over top; place the other crust over that, being careful 
to keep them even ; then seal edges by pressing them to- 
gether with the finger tips. Impress later with a thin, 
light stick into square inches; then with knife or sharp in- 
strument separate one from another. Dry a couple of hours 
before cooking. Boil HKC macaroni in a large pot until 
dough is soft enough to suit taste. Drain and add Italian 
gravy, same as is used for macaroni.

Pj'es and Pastry 



To make quick paste sift into mixing bowl three level cup- 
fuls of flour. Chop into this, with a stiff spoon, one level 
cupful of lard; add salt to taste and moisten with ice water. 
Stir vigorously for a half minute only, turn out upon a 
floured board and pat gently into shape with the rolling-pin, 
not allowing the hands to come into contact with the dough. 
Lastly roll out as thin as desired and if pastry cups are to- 
be made place the little patee pans so that each one may 
have a small margin around it; cut out the circles with a 
sharp knife. An excellent and quick method is to invert the 
patee pans and cover the outside with the pastry. 

Mrs. Richard Leach. 

Pie Crust Three cups of sifted "flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, one and one-half cups of lard and half of a cup of 
ice water. Mix the flour and the salt and lard quickly and 
lightly together with the tips of the fingers. Pour in the 
water slowly, mixing all the time with a silver fork. Let 
stand for some hours in the ice chest. This will make two 
pies. Cut into four pieces. When ready for use, take out 
one piece onto a well-floured board ; dust well with flour and 
roll quickly with a well-floured rolling pin until perfectly 
round and large enough to fit the pie pan. Lay on the pan, 
fill with sugared fruit, wet the edges of the crust, cutting 
off rim that falls over the sides ; roll out the upper crust, fold 
it over; slit it four times with a sharp knife; lay over the 
fruit. Wet the top well with water. Pinch together the 
crust on the sides and bake in a rather quick oven. Always 
add a teaspoonful of flour mixed with the sugar to any juicy 
fruit, such as currants or blackberries, to each pie, and as 
much sugar as fruit. Mrs. C. R. Gagan. 

Banana Pie Bake a good-sized pie shell. Place a layer 
of sliced bananas, then a layer of filling, then a layer of 
bananas, and then a frosting made of two whites of eggs 
beaten stiff and one-fourth of a cup of sugar, flavored with

Pickles, Jellies, Preserves 



About Pickles and Preserves In making preserves the 
following are excellent rules to observe: 1. The fruit must 
be gathered dry. 2. It must be carefully stirred with a 
wooden spoon to prevent burning. 3. It must be slowly boiled 
before adding sugar, and quickly boiled afterward. 4. It 
must be put in well-dried pots, and kept in a dry, airy place. 

To Pickle Beets To pickle beets, wash the roots very 
clean, but do not scrape them ; put them into boiling water, 
and keep them boiling from two to three hours, till perfectly 
tender. Take them out and let them remain till cold, then 
pare and slice the root, cover it with vinegar which has been 
boiled and cooled, and in which a teaspoonful of salt and 
half the quantity of cayenne has been boiled. Put the pickle 
into jars, and in a few days it will be fit for use. 

Red Currant Preserve In making red currant preserve 
be sure to remember that to every pound of fruit you allow 
three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar. Weigh the cur- 
rants, and afterwards strip them from the stalks (do this 
with a fork to prevent staining the hands). Place fruit and 
sugar in preserving pan, and boil for about three-quarters 
of an hour.

of rock salt to three quarts of boiling water. Boil and strain.

To Pickle Olives Olives ripen in winter, and should be 
picked from the trees when they turn purple. Care should 
be taken in handling the fruit when gathering it, so that it 
will not be bruised. After they are gathered, put them in

taste is removed. The olives are then put into cold water, 
which should be changed twice daily, until all taste of the 
lye has disappeared. They are then placed in weak brine 
for three or four days, after which they are changed into 
brine strong enough to bear an egg, where they will keep 
indefinitely. M. H.

FOR THE SICK 



Arrowroot Water Moisten one teaspoonful of arrow- 
root with cold water; smooth, into a paste; add one pint of 
boiling water and boil five minutes, stirring continuously. 

Barley Water Wash in cold water two ounces of pearl 
barley. Boil five minutes, then drain. Pour on two quarts 
of boiling water and boil down to a quart. Flavor with 
thinly cut lemon rind; add sugar to taste; strain only at 
patient's request. 

Beef Juice Cut thin juicy meat into pieces one and one- 
half inches square ; boil one and one half minutes over a hot 
fire. Squeeze with a hot lemon squeezer; season with salt 
and pepper. May be added to milk or poured over toast. 

Beef Extract Heat a select piece of round steak so that 
the juice may be freely pressed. Cut steak into pieces that 
will fit into a lemon squeezer and squeeze into a cup. Set 
cup into a dish of hot water which must not be allowed to 
boil. Season to taste. May be served on toast. 

Beef Tea Free a pound of lean beef from fat, skin, etc. 
Chop up fine. Put in a pint of cold water to digest two 
hours. Simmer for three hours, but do not let it boil. Make 
up the water lost by adding cold water. Press and strain. 
The best meats for beef tea are the round and rump. Cold 
water draws out the albumen; boiling water coagulates it. 

Scraped Beef Sandwich From a piece of steak scrape 
all the fibre from the connective tissue with a knife. Season 
with salt and pepper. Serve between slices of buttered toast. 

Clam Broth Take several large clams; scrub them 
clean and boil in a cup of water. The broth is simply the

Junket Heat half a pint of fresh milk. Add a tea- 
spoonful of essence of pepsin ; stir enough to mix. Pour 
into custard cups and let stand until firm. Serve plain or 
powder with sugar or nutmeg. 

Koumiss One tablespoonful of sugar in a quart of fresh 
milk. Dissolve one-fifth of a cake of yeast in a little cold 
water; then stir it into the milk. Put the mixture into 
strong patent stopped bottles. Shake the bottles for one 
minute, then stand them on end in a refrigerator or other 
cool place. After three days place the bottles on their 
sides, and turn them occasionally. Five days will be re- 
quired to perfect the fermentation. 

To Peptonize Milk Pepsin grs. xx; Cold water zu; 
milk oj. Directions Place the contents of one of the vials 
into a well cleaned quart bottle. Pour upon it a gill of cool 
water and shake the mixture thoroughly. Then add to 
the mixture a pint of fresh milk and place the bottles in a 
vessel containing water as hot as can be borne by the hand 
without discomfort. Let it stand, with occasional shaking, 
from ten to twenty minutes, or until it has acquired a slight- 
ly bitter taste, when it should be removed from the hot 
water and placed upon ice or in a cool place, to check di- 
gestion and keep from spoiling. If not quickly cooled the 
digestion will continue and the milk becomes too bitter to 
be palatable. Milk thus peptonized may be sweetened if the 
patient desires it. It may also be flavored with wine or 
rum as desirable. 

Cold Process This consists in adding to the milk the 
peptonizing powder as above, using cool water and milk, and 
then placing the mixture upon the ice without warming it 
at all. 

N. B. If it be found that the milk ferments after fol- 
lowing the above directions, boil the milk first, let cool and 
then peptonize. The bacteria in uncooked milk cause fer- 
mentation when pepsin is added. 

Lime Water Into two quarts of water place a lump of 
unslaked lime the size of an egg. After standing awhile,, 
stir thoroughly and pour off the solution; add fresh water- 
and keep covered.

Milk and Lime Water Milk and lime water are now 
frequently prescribed by physicians in cases of dispepsia and 
weakness of the stomach, and in some cases are said to be 
beneficial. Many persons who think good bread and milk 
a great luxury, frequently hesitate to eat it, for the reason 
that the milk will not digest readily ; sourness of the stomach 
will often follow. But experience shows that lime water 
and milk are not only food and medicine at an early period 
of life, but also at a later, when, as in the case of infants, 
the functions of digestion and assimilation are feeble and 
easily perverted. A stomach taxed by gluttony, irritated 
by improper food, inflamed by alcohol, enfeebled by disease, 
or otherwise unfitted for its duties as is shown by the vari- 
ous symptoms attendant upon indigestion, dyspepsia, 
diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever will resume its work, and 
do it energetically, on an exclusive diet of bread and milk 
and lime water. A goblet of milk may have four tablespoon- 
fuls of lime water added to it with good effect. The way to 
make lime water is simply to procure a few lumps of un- 
slaked lime, put the lime in a stone jar, and add water until 
the lime is slaked and of about the consistence of thin cream ; 
the lime settles, leaving the pure and clean lime water on top. 

Milk Lemonade A tablespoonful of sugar, juice of one 
lemon, two tablespoonfuls of sherry, half a cup of milk and 
half a cup of water. 

Milk Punch Cup of milk and two tablespoonfuls of 
brandy. Sweeten to taste. Grated nutmeg may be added. 

Lemon Whey One cup of boiling milk, one pound of 
sugar and one-fourth of a cup of lemon juice. Sweeten 
milk; pour lemon juice into hot milk and let stand until 
curds separate from whey. Strain. Serve hot or cold. 

Mrs. P. Lemon.. 

Imperial Lemonade One lemon, three pounds of sugar r 
one cup of water and half a teaspoonful of cream of tartar. 
Boil sugar, water and thin slices of lemon rind together five 
minutes ; when cold add lemon juice and last of all the cream 
of tartar, which has been dissolved in a little hot water. 
Serve at once. Mrs. P. Lemon.

Oyster Broth Chop a dozen oysters fine, put into a 
saucepan with a cup of cold water. Bring to a boiling point, 
simmer five minutes, then strain and season. By adding 
milk three minutes before the broth is taken from the fire 
it is made more palatable. 

Scalloped Oysters Clean oysters, roll crackers and mix 
with melted butter. Sprinkle dish with crumbs, then place 
a layer of oysters and a layer of crumbs, another layer of 
oysters, and so on until all are used. Bake in a hot oven. 

Oatmeal Water A teaspoonful of oatmeal to a quart 
of water. Boil down to a pint and strain. 

Oatmeal Gruel Two tablespoonfuls of rolled oats, a 
teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of sugar and a cup of boil- 
ing milk. Mix oatmeal, sugar and salt ; add boiling water ;

Oysters on the Half Shell Wash the shells and put them 
on hot coals or upon the top of hot stove, or bake in a hot 
oven. Open shells, taking care not to lose any of the liquor. 
Serve at once on hot plates with toast. 

To Boil Clams Wash shells clean, and put the clams 
{the edges downward) in a kettle; pour about a quart of 
"boiling water over them. Cover the pot, and set it over a 
brisk fire for forty-five minutes. The boiling water will 
open the shells quickly and let out the sand. When done 
remove the black skin which covers the hard part, trim 
<clean, and put into a stewpan. Add some of the liquor in 
which they were boiled, and a large piece of butter; pepper 
-and salt to taste ; serve hot. 

Panada Two Boston soda or graham crackers, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar and a pinch of salt. Put creckers in bowl 
with sugar and salt between them. Pour over just enough 
boiling water to soak well. Put bowl into vessel of boiling 
water and let stand fifteen or twenty mintues ; lift crackers 
out clear but not broken. Serve with cream. This is very 
good for babies of eight months or so. Mrs. P. Lemon.

For Sick Stomach The following drink for relieving 
sickness of the stomach is said to be very palatable and 
agreeable : Beat up one egg very well, say for twenty min- 
utes, then add fresh milk one pint, water one pint, sugar to 
make it palatable; boil, and get it cool; drink when cold. 
If it becomes curds and whey it is useless. . 

Toast for an Invalid When food for an invalid is to 
be served on toast, fix it this way : After removing the crust, 
cut the toast lengthwise into half -inch strips and then cut 
crosswise, so as to form small squares. Push these squares 
gently together so that the slice appears whole once more, 
and then place on it a poached egg or creamed chicken. A 
convalescent, too weak to use both hands at once, needs only 
the aid of a fork to enable him to eat such a meal in perfect 
comfort. Mrs. R. Leach. 

Stuffed Baked Potato Select a smooth potato; scrub 
well, and bake in a hot oven about fifty minutes. Cut one 
end partly off lengthwise ; scrape out the potato into a dish ;

Albumen Water Break the white of an egg into a bowl. 
Beat until it commences to froth, then add gradually a cup- 
ful of water, beating continually. Set away in a cool place. 
This is very nourishing and will stay on the weakest stomach 
when all other things fail. It is almost tasteless, but may 
be made more palatable by adding the juice of one orange. 

Mrs. Everman. 

Barley Water (To substitute for milk in case of vom- 
iting, etc.) Two teaspoonfuls of pearl barley to one pint of 
cold water. Let simmer about an hour. Pour off and 
strain. Mrs. Everman. 

Whey for Babies Add sodium bicarbonate gr. x to half 
a pint of whey to render it alkaline; and sugar of milk zi. 
to raise the sugar to six per cent. 

Custard Put three-fourths of a cup of milk into 
a double boiler top, and have the water boiling underneath. 
Separate the white and yolk of one egg. Beat the white 
up. adding a tiny pinch of salt. Add a scant tablespoonful 
of sugar to the yolk and beat it well. As soon as the milk 
is scalded, pour a small quantity into the beaten yolk and 
stir well. Add the remainder of the milk, a little at a time, 
and beat all well. Then stir the beaten white in and pour 
into the double boiler top, and set in the boiling water again. 
Stir constantly until it thickens a little and pour off imme- 
diately. This is a very safe recipe and makes about two 
small cupfuls. Mrs. Everman. 

Beef juice Partly broil a piece of juicy steak about the 
size of a small dinner plate. Cut into small pieces and press 
the juice from them in a meat press. Pour into a granite 
cup and set in hot water to warm. Do not allow it to be- 
come more than hike-warm, as too much heat will cause a 
curd to form. Break a little bread into this (whole wheat 
bread is always preferable) and add a tiny pinch of salt. 
This is much quicker to prepare than beef tea and has the- 
same value. Mrs. Everman.

Miscella n eous 



Colic in Infants Infants are very subject to colic from 
overfeeding, too early feeding, constipation and many other 
causes. They often suffer terribly from these pains, tossing 
about, drawing up their legs, and screaming vehemently. 
Treatment When it arises from eostiveness, a teaspoonful 
or tablespoonful of castor oil will often remove the defect, 
and at or about the same time give three drops of essence 
of peppermint or spearmint, in a little sweetened water. A 
very little salaratus often gives relief, and paregoric in two 
to five-drop doses every hour, will give relief. Hot flannels 
applied over the bowels and stomach are useful, and often 
the infant can be greatly relieved by laying it upon the belly 
on the knee, trotting it and gently tapping its back; this 
must be done cautiously, for if unsuccessful it might increase 
the pains. 

Pare a fresh lemon very carefully, without breaking the 
thin, white, inside skin, put it inside a wild duck and keep it 
there for forty-eight hours, and all the fishy taste, so disa- 
greeable in wild fowls, will be removed. The lemon should 
be removed, and a fresh one put in its place as often as every 
twelve hours. A lemon thus prepared will absorb unpleas- 
ant flavors from almost all meat or game. 

To flavor a roast of beef deliciously, to make it tender, 
and to give variety which is essential in that family where 
beef is the staple meat eaten to do all this, nothing more 
is required than a large lemon ; cut it in two pieces, squeeze 
all the juice upon the roast, then, after peeling the lemon, 
roll it up in the roast.. When the lemon is used, no water 
is needed. The roast should be a fat one, to insure good 
gravy, and the lemon acid will remove the oily taste some- 
times objected to. 

To many housewives the curtains are a source of con- 
tinual worry. The best way to wash them is as follows: 
Wash thoroughly in hot suds and wring out the water with

out well and stretch. Pin quite flat on a clean sheet and

leave to dry on the floor of a seldom-used room. Leave till 
nearly dry, and iron with hot iron, then they are ready for

straight folds. 

If you wish to shut off any view through a window you 
can do it very cheaply in the following manner: Dissolve 
in a little hot water as much Epsom salts as the water will 
absorb. Paint this over the inside of the window. When 
dry you will have a fair imitation of ground glass. 

Young housekeepers are sometimes unacquainted with 
the difference between a tea-cloth and a duster. Tea-cloths 
should be of linen, and about a yard long, and of a darker 
and coarser texture than glass-cloths, which should be fine, 
white and free from that downy substance which is in some 
kinds of material, and which would stick to the glass and 
prevent its looking bright and clean. Dusters should be 
of blue checked stuff for use in the kitchen, and of white 
linen for the other rooms in the house. 

When working in the kitchen, protect your dress and 
apron by wearing a square of thin oilcloth. To make it 
quite neat, bind it with braid, and attach strings to the up- 
per corners. This needs only to be washed off when soiled, 
and can be discarded in a second if there is a ring at the 
door-bell. 

Meat will keep in the hot weather for many days if it 
is hung in a current of air and covered with a muslin which 
has been wrung out in vinegar. This should be renewed 
every day. 

If you wish to stick anything and have no blue in the 
house, try the following recipe : Take a small piece of cold 
potato which has been boiled, and rub it up and down on a 
piece of paper with your fingers for about five minutes. It 
will become the right consistency,' and stick as well as the 
strongest glue. 

To Prevent Spotting A teaspoonful of black pepper 
will prevent gray or buff linens from spotting, if stirred into 
the first water in which they are washed. It will also pre- 
vent the colors running, when washing black or colored

In removing grease spots by benzine, the stained outline 
which is left can be prevented by the application of gypsum, 
extending a little beyond the moistened region. When dry, 
shake the powder off, and no trace of the spot will remain. 

To Remove Bruises From Furniture Wet the bruised 
spots with warm water. Soak a piece of brown paper of 
several thicknesses in warm water, and lay over the place. 
Then apply a warm flat-iron until the moisture is gone. Re- 
peat the process if needful, and the bruises will disappear.
