TO THE 

BAKERS OF AMERICA 

THIS VOLUME, 

THE FRUIT OF MANY YEARS' EXPERIENCE 

AS A BAKER 

IN 

CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES 

IS 

RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED 

BY THEIR BROTHER WORKMAN 

THE AUTHOR 



INTRODUCTION. 

It is the aim of the author, in placing this 
book before the public, to fill one of the bakers' 
long-felt needs; not a great compilation of all 
sorts of receipts, with only here and there 
one that a baker can possibly make use of, but 
a compact volume composed of the very cream 
of bakers' receipts, every one of which is a staple 
article in the trade, with full directions for mix- 
ing and working the same. 

The author is well known as a most successful 
baker, always being able to build up a fine trade 
in the city where he locates. 

Some of the receipts are original with him, 
and have always been strictly guarded by him 
as secrets of the trade. These, together with the 
best of those collected during his many years 
of experience as a baker, and his travels through 
the Eastern and Western States, are given in 
this little volume. 

The receipts are all well tested, and the man 
who has a fair knowledge of baking to begin 
with, and who has this invaluable book to aid 
him, will find himself thoroughly equipped to 
handle the best of trade anywhere in the United 
States.

BREAD. 

TO SPONGE BREAD. 

In setting sponge for bread, my experience 
has always been that a heavy sponge is best. 
For example, if a 4-bucket dough is desired, 
set a 2^-bucket sponge, and "lift on" i\ buckets 
of water to the dough. 

Great care should be taken when making 
sponge bread about the temperature of the 
water. Many bakers get the water too hot, and 
hot water spoils many a batch of bread. 

The quantity of salt to a bucket should never 
be over \ lb. In cold weather 6 oz. will be 
plenty. 

Note. — A "bucket" means 10 qts. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD, No. 1. 

\ lb. sugar, \ lb. rye flour, \ lb. white flour, 
\ lb. graham flour, if lbs. corn flour, f oz. soda, 
I oz. salt, 1 pt. molasses. 

Mix slack with milk or water. 

13 



14 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD, No. 2. 

£ tb. white flour, \ lb. rye flour,, \ lb. graham 
flour, f tb. corn meal, 1 pt. molasses, 1 oz. salt. 
Mix with water or milk, using 1 oz. baking 
powder in batch. 

STRAIGHT DOUGH BREAD (With corn- 
flour in the mixture). 

Scald about 1 lb. of white corn flour to 
each bucket of water used in the dough. 

Make medium dough, using clear spring 
wheat flour, and 3 oz. yeast, \ lb. salt, J lb. 
sugar, \ tb. lard to each bucket. 

When this dough comes up, cut it over; let it 
come up again and work it over a second time. 
Then when light, throw it out upon the bench, 
scale it off, round up on bench, then mold 
round and place on pans, 12 loaves on a pan r 
and grease every four loaves. 

Give short proof, dust tops with flour, and 
bake in solid oven. 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 15 

This formula alone is worth one hundred dol- 
lars to any man in the baking business. 

GRAHAM BREAD (Straight dough). 

I bucket lukewarm water. 

3 pints New Orleans molasses. 

3^ ounces compressed yeast. 

Mix medium dough with all graham flour. 
Cut this dough over when light, then let stand 
until light again, when it will be ready to work 
off. 

HOME MADE BREAD, No. i. 

Straight dough (for single loaves in tins) or 
home made bread. 

Four-bucket dough 

Make a medium dough with 4 buckets luke- 
warm water, 12 oz. compressed yeast, 2 lbs. 
salt, 3 lbs. granulated sugar, and 2 lbs. lard. 

When dough comes up and commences to 
turn give it a good dry work-over. Let it come 



16 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

well up again, then throw it out upon the bench 
and scale it off into tins. 

Give it short proof, then bake. 

Use about 1-3 spring wheat flour, and 2-3 
winter wheat flour. 

This is the bread that Price, of Detroit, Mich- 
igan, had such a run on a few years ago. 

HOME MADE BREAD, No. 2. 

Straight dough (with clear winter wheat). 

Four-bucket dough. 

Make a straight dough with 4 buckets luke- 
warm water, 12 oz. compressed yeast, 2 lbs. salt, 
2 tbs. sugar and 2 lbs. lard. 

When the dough commences to turn, cut over, 
then when light, punch down, throw out upon 
the bench, scale off and mold into pans. Give 
fair proof, but not too much, then bake. 

This bread has met with great success in dif- 
ferent cities. 

If winter wheat flour is not very strong, a little 
spring wheat flour may be used. 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 17 

QUAKER BREAD. 

Formula for making 200 i-ft>. loaves. 

4 buckets of lukewarm water, 3 oz. com- 
pressed yeast, £ tb. salt, J lb. sugar, \ lb. lard, 
and 3^ oz. malt extract to the bucket. 

Make slack dough with clear spring wheat 
flour. Let dough stand 3 \ hours ; then cut over, 
let stand again 1 hour; cut over again and let 
stand f hour; then punch it down, throw it out 
upon the bench, scale it off and mold it into 
pans, 2 loaves in a pan. 

Give it short proof and bake in solid oven. 

This bread is the standard bread of today all 
over the United States. 

SALT-RISING BREAD. 

This is perhaps the most difficult bread to 
make, but it is a good seller if it is made right. 

The following formula is about the best one 
I ever tried and it is a good one. 

Set a Railroad yeast with equal parts of gin- 



1ft BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

ger, sugar, salt and soda, about I teaspoonful 
altogether, in a quart bowl. Pour I pt. boiling 
water in the bowl and stir well, adding enough 
canell, or middlings, to make stiff batter. 

Keep this in a warm place about 7 hours, 
when it will be light. Set sponge with this, using 
about 2\ qts. of lukewarm water, and keep in 
a warm place to rise again. When this sponge 
is light, add 2.\ qts. more of lukewarm water, 
and 4 oz. salt. Then mix and scale off and put 
into pans. When light, bake. 

Always keep this bread in a warm place, as it 
needs much "nursing." If it gets chilled, the 
batch is lost. 

Use all winter wheat flour. 

SPONGE BREAD. 

Four-bucket dough, about 200 i-lb. loaves. 

Take 2 J buckets lukewarm water, and 12 oz. 
compressed yeast; set a fair-sized sponge and 
work it clear. When it has come up, and 
dropped about one inch, it is ready 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 19 

Then add I J buckets of water, temperature to 
be gaged according to weather, and for each 
bucket \ lb. salt, -J lb. sugar, \ lb. lard. Make 
medium dough. When it comes up, cut it over 
and let stand about three-quarters of an hour, 
when it will be ready to work off. Keep dough 
on young side. This makes nice pan bread. 

CHICAGO VIENNA BREAD. 

Four-bucket dough, 200 i-lb. loaves. 

Set 2-bucket sponge with water, using about 
3 oz. compressed yeast to a bucket. 

When the sponge just commences to turn, it 
is ready; then add 2 buckets of sweet milk, us- 
ing - to each bucket \ tb. salt, f lb. sugar and f 
lb. lard. 

Let this dough come up good, then cut it 
over. When it comes the second time, scale it 
off and round it up. Then mold into loaves 
and place in cloths. When ready run it into 
oven. If the oven has no steam attachments 



20 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

set a pan of water in it near the furnace, to 
make steam. Keep oven door closed until the 
bread is baked. 

GENUINE VIENNA BREAD. 

Set a slack sponge with 2\ qts. of lukewarm 
sweet milk and 2.\ oz. compressed yeast. When 
the sponge commences to turn, add 2 \ qts. sweet 
milk, 4 oz. salt, \ lb. sugar, \ lb. lard. 

Mix medium dough and scale it off imme- 
diately; round up on bench, let it stand until it 
gets a start, then mold up in long loaves. Place 
the loaves in cloths or baskets until they are of 
the right proof, then bake on oven bottom. 

This is the bread that the Austrian bakers 
made at the Centennial Exposition held at Phil- 
adrlphia in 1876. 

BAKING POWDER BISCUIT. 

6 lbs. flour. 

\ lb. butter. 

6 oz. baking powder. 

2 qts. and \ pt. milk. 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 21 

Sieve baking powder through flour, and mix 
in other ingredients; roll out and cut, wash with 
egg and bake in hot oven. 

ENGLISH MUFFINS. 

Set a sponge with 3 qts. of water and 3 
oz. of compressed yeast, using spring wheat 
flour; make a thin sponge and toughen it well. 

Let it rise, and when it commences to drop, 
take a wooden spatula and beat it down; then 
add 2 oz. of salt, and enough flour to make 
a slack but very tough dough. 

When it has been beaten and toughened, dust 
with flour, and set away to prove up. 

When proved, work or beat it up again, and 
turn it out upon the board — the board must 
be well floured. 

Then comes the most difficult part of the proc- 
ess. Clasp one hand about one end of the 
dough, and squeeze enough of it through the 
hand, between the thumb and first finger, to 



22 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

form the muffin; cut off with finger of other 
hand, being careful not to break the skin of the 
dough. 

To prove them a tray is needed, with the bot- 
tom covered 2 inches deep with flour, and holes 
made in it with the round top of a cake-cutter. 
As fast as the muffins are formed, drop into 
these holes to keep from spreading. When all 
are in the tray, dust with flour and set to prove. 

When proved, they are taken up, one at a 
time, and dropped upon a hot plate to bake. 

These are the genuine English Muffins that 
were introduced into Chicago during the 
World's Fair. 

COMMON SPLIT ROLLS, AND SUGAR 
BUNS.

lies,and English Bath Buns, using a slack dough 
for the last named. 

These sweet goods are made and sold every 
day in the city of Chicago. 



24 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 

WAFFLES. 

Boil i pt. of sweet milk, and let stand till cool, 
then stir in enough flour to make a thick batter; 
add a tablespoonful of melted butter, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and one small cake of compressed 
yeast. 

When light, add two well beaten eggs. Heat 
the waffle-iron, grease it thoroughly, and fill 
with the batter. 

Bake two or three minutes, then turn the iron 
over; this will give a nice color on both sides.

BREAD FORMULAS. 

There is no fixed bread formula. A bread 
formula is merely a combination of ingredients 
proportioned to suit the conditions under which 
the baker is working. A fixed formula is im- 
possible, as all bakers are working under differ- 
ent shop conditions, climate, temperature and 
manner of handling. The vital bread-baking in- 
gredients are : Flour, water, salt and yeast. The 
special character and individuality of the bread 
desired depend on the addition of such ma- 
terials as potato flour, sugar, fat, malt and milk. 
Potato flour produces individual and distinctive 
bread excellence. 

The formulas given here, however, have been 
successfully tried and are now in use in many 
large and small bakeries.

Formula No. 2. 
44 tbs. sugar (powdered). 

2 tbs. butter, 
i qt. eggs. 

7 tbs. flour. 

1 4 oz. bicarbonate of soda, 
l tb. bitter chocolate. 
4 lb. almond paste. 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK. 119 

i J lbs. granulated sugar. 

2\ qts. milk. 

f qt. water. 
Beat the powdered sugar, butter, almond 
paste, eggs and bicarbonate of soda to a creamy 
consistency. Next add the milk and break up 
the creamy mass. Add the melted chocolate 
and stir and mix in the flour. The chocolate is 
melted by putting f pt. of water and \\ tbs. of 
granulated sugar on the fire to boil, placing the 
chocolate in the syrup after it has been removed 
from the fire. This is allowed to cool before it 
is added to the mixture. One pound of walnuts 
may be added to this mixture if desired. 

HONEY CAKE. 
12 lbs. honey.

16 lbs. flour (part pastry and bread). 

Place the water and honey on the stove to 
boil. When it begins to boil remove immedi- 
ately. When the honey has cooled add the flour 



120 BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK 

and mix into a medium soft dough. It is well 
to keep out a little of the flour, as the flour and 
honey vary in consistency. Sometimes more 
flour is needed. This dough is now placed in a 
clean vessel and stored away in a cool place for 
aging. The above ingredients will yield approx- 
imately 30 lbs. of dough. When this dough is 
to be worked up into cakes add the following to 
every 10 lbs. of dough : 

5 egg yolks. 

1 oz. cloves. 

i|- oz. anise seed. 

1 oz. coreander seed. 

2,\ oz. potash. 

Place the potash in a mortar and run smooth. 
Now put the dough and other ingredients, in- 
cluding the dissolved potash, in a mixing bowl 
and mix into a smooth dough. Make a trial 
baking to see if the dough contains the proper 
amount of raising material. If the cake comes 
up well, continue making the cakes. If the 



BAXTER'S RECEIPT BOOK 121 

sample comes up well and falls, the dough con- 
tains too much raising material and more of the 
dough must be added. If the cakes are not 
light enough, add a little more potash. Most 
honey cakes made today do not contain the 
stock dough. 

SCOTCH SHORT BREAD. 

4 lbs. flour. 
2 lbs. butter. 
I lb. sugar. 

Rub the sugar and butter until the mass be- 
comes creamed, then add the flour and mix to a 
stiff paste. Care should be taken that the paste 
base does not become oily. Divide the base 
paste into pieces of the desired weight, roll into 
round forms and then roll each piece into a 
disc having the required thickness. These discs 
are easily crimpled into a fancy border on the 
edge with the thumb and forefinger. Place them 
on the pans and bake until they become of a

light brown color. In making the fancy short 
breads, such as are used during the holiday sea- 
son, decorate the center with royal icing. Short 
bread as it is made in our country may be made 
as follows:

washed with a sugar syrup or with a solution of 
gum arabic and sugar. The gum arabic solution 
may be made by dissolving 2 ounces of gum 
arabic and one-half pound of sugar in one quart 
of water. The glazing solution should be 
brushed over the bars just as they come from 
the oven and returned for a very short time, or 
until the solution becomes dry, care being 
taken, however, not to put on too much of the 
wash.
