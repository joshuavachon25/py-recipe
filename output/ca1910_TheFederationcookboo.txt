Dedicated to the Federation Cook Book 

By Mrs. Katherine D. Tillman, A. M. 

Chairman Ways and Means 
National Association Colored Women' s Clubs 

She could draw a little, paint a little, 

Talk about a book. 
She could row a boat, ride a horse. 
But alas she couldn't cook. 

She could gown, she could go, 

She could very pretty look 
But her best beau he was poor 

And he couldn't hire a cook. 
When he learned the fatal truth 

His flight he quickly took, 
And his girl is single still, 

Because she couldn't cook! 
***>?***** 

Believe not the love tales 

You find within a book 

Love's fate often turns on, 

The skill of the cook 
Before a man marries 

'Tis the gown or the look, 
But after the wedding 
He looks for a cook. 

'Tis said to man's heart, 

The shortest route took 
Is reached through the region, 

Controlled by the cook! 
Go forth then a blessing, 

You dear little book, 
And happiness ever 
Attend the good cook.

one sprig of parsley, one-half teaspoon of salt, a few grains

for four or five hours in warm water until meat falls to 
pieces. Add vegetables and season about hour before the 
soup is done. Strain and set aside for 2 to 4 hours. 

Clear Soup Stock Remove the fat, mix with shell and
