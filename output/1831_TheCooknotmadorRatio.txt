this great man throughout an eventful life of nearly 
fifty years. HIh last curoplairit was even said to 
be nereditary in the family. , < 

This small digression will be overlooked in tl^ 
preface to a system of Cookery whicli has for its 
main object the health of its friends. Temperance 
in the quality and quaii-ity of our diet coptributes 
more to our health and comfort than we Bte aware 
of. It was the remark of an eminent physician 
upon the inquiries of a patienc, '* that it was of less 
importance what kind of ibod wiB a^ than the 
quantilij and the mode of its preparamn, for the 
stomach." . 

It is not required that every particular be attend- 
ed to in a receipt for cooking. Directions ar« giv- 
en according to the taste of writers, or their 
kno\ylodge of what is approved by others. Both 
these criteria may bo used with freedom when 
brought into piactice, for '* of all sorts is the world 
made up." Let every pne, therefore, consider tho 
best prescription in Cookery, as nothing uk*. ' 
than a basis to be followed to the letter, or devia*"l 
froiUj according to taste arid Gircamslanccs.

No 1. A good pickle for Hams\ 

One ounce of salt petre, one (»int of salt^ 
lialf pint of molasses to eacli ham; put 
paur 6alt petre ibta the molasses and rub 
your hams in it, then put your hams into 
a sweet cask, put your salt into water c- 
nough to cover your hams, turn it on to 
them and turn them often for six weeks. — • 
If the hams are large, add more sa|t, then 
smoke them ten days. Beef for drying*' 
done in the same way, also Beef tongues. 

;No 2. TocornBeaf. # 

To one hundred pounds of beef, three 
oimcdl^Balt petre, five pints of salt, a small 
quantity of molasses will improve it, but 
good without. ±2 

No 3. Ta pickle one hundred pounds vf 
^ ^ Beef to Jceep>a0&ar. • >^ 

Put together thr^puartl%alt,^ix otmces 
salt petre, one apia a half pints of molas- 
ses, and water sufficient to cover yoiir 
meat after laid into the barrel. Sprinkle 
the bottom of the barrel with salt, tmd also

Kjf>» 



slightly sprinkl/bclw^n the layers of 
meat as you pack, wh^n done, pour on your 
pickle and lay on a stone or board to keep 
the whole down. Beef salted after, this 
method durtng the fall or winter may bo 
kept nice and tender throuf^h the summer 
bj taking it up about tho first of May, 
scald and iekim the brine, ad:i three quarts 
of salt,' when cold pour back upon the 
hee£. 

No 4. To salt Pork. 

Sprinkle salt in the bottom of the barrel, 
and take care to sprinkle the same plenti- 
fully between each layer afterwards. Let 
ilie layers be packed Very snug by having 
the pieces cut of al?out equal width, say 
live or six inc! es, and placed edgewise, 
the rind being towards the barrel. Pork 
will only take a proper quantity of salt, be 
there ever so much in the barrel. The 
surplus answers for anotheV time. 

Caution. — Although the same brine will 
answf r for pickling be^as that for hams, 
and %ie lean parts c^pork, yet the two 
kinds of meat should iibt be in the brine 
at the same time. A small piece of beef 
placed in a barrel where there is pork, 
would spoil the latter quickly. A beef 
barrel, likewise, should never be used for 

»ork, no matter how thorougly scalded or 

leansed> ^ 

No &. To roast Beef. 

^ T\i0 general rules are/ to have a brisk 
hot firet to be placed pn a spit, to baste

No 6. Roast Mutton. ; 

; If a breast, let it be cauled, if a leg, 
» sjtufTed or not, let it be done inore gently 
Khan beef, and done more ; the chine, sad-

V tatoes, beans, or boiled onions, caper sauce^ 
marshed turnip, or lettuce. L 

No 7. Roast Veal. 

r ■■..._■ 

As it is more tenjtler than beef or mut^ 
ton, and easily scdlbhed, paper it, espe- 
cially the fat parts, let there be a brisk fire, 
baste it well: a. loin weighing fifteen 
^iponnds requires . two hours and a half 
roasting ; garnish with green parsley and 
^*^ sliced lemon.

No 21. To clarify Drippings. M-'t 

Put your dripping into a clean sauco-pnn 
over a stove or slow fire ; when it is just 
going to boil, skim it well, let it boil, and 
then let it stand till it is a little cooled ; 
then pour it through a sieve into a pan. 

06;r.*— Well-cleansed drippings, and the 
fat skimmings of the broth-pot, when fresh 
and sweet, will baste every thing as well 
as butter, except came and poultry, and 
should supply the placo of butter for com- 
mon fries, &c. ; for which they are equal 
to lard, especialTy if you repeat the clari- 
fying twice oyer. 

t N! B. If you keep it in a cool place, you 
ifnay preserve it a fortnight in summer, and 
longer in iyihter. When you have donq,^ 
frying, let the dripping stand a few min* 
utesto settle, and then pour it through a 
sieve into a clean bason or stone pan, and 
it wjll do a second and third time as well 
as it did the first ; only the fat you have 
fried fish in must not be used for any other 
purpose. 

No 22. Ta clarify Suet to fry with. 

Cut beef or niutton suet mto thin slices, 
pick out all the veins and skins, &c. put it 
into a thick and well tinned sauce pan, and 
set it over a very slow stove, or in an 
oven, till it be melted ^ you must not hur- 
ry it ; if not done very slowly it will ac- 
quire a burnt taste, whif^h you cannot get 
rid of; then strain it through a hair si^ve 
into a clean pan: when quite cold^ 
lie a paper over it, and keep it for U86v 
Hog^s lard 18 prepared in theisame wayt

.The first necessary caution is that your 
pots and covers are always kept clean-^be 
careful that your plit is constantly boiling, 
by this means you may determine yith pre- 
cision the time necessary to accomplish any 
dish you may wish to prepare in this way 
—put fresh meat into boiling water, and 
salt into cold— never crowd your pot with 
meat, but leave sufficient room for a plenty 
of water— allow a quarter of an hour to 
every pound ofmeat. 

No 38. ^ To boil Ham. 

This is an important article, and/requires 
particular attention, in order to/render it 
elegant and grateful. It shouldbe boiled 
ia a large quantity of water, and that for a 
long time, one quarter of an hour for each 
pound; the rind to be takeh off when 
warm. It is most palatable when cold, 
and should be sent to the table with eggs, 
horse radish or mustard. This affords a 
sweet repast at any time of day.

Provide yourself with a few sheets of 
blotting^ paper, the number to be regulated 
by the juiciness of the plants; having 
stretched one half the paper on a table, ar- 
range the parts of the flower or plant to bo 
dried in the manner you think it will after- 
wards look the best ; lay the other half of 
the paper over the flower or plant as harm- 
lessly as possible; then, with a smoothing- 
iron, well heated, you may easily extract 
all the moisture. Keep movmg the paper 
as oflen as it becomcH wet ; continue the 
operation until no moisture comes. The 
advantage ef this method is, that the flow- 
ers so prepared, retain the original colour* 
If you intend the specimen for a malange, 
moisten one side of the flower with a strong 
mucilage of gum, when it will reai|ily ad- 
here to paper. If you wish to prelili've it 
Utill farther, %ash the whole repeatedly 
irith a solution of isiuglitffs^ prepuratpry to 
its receiving a wash orisi^pnd varhtab^ In 
this way the plant maybe preserved in full

No 271, Dried Beef. 

Beef is always corned and dried in. the 
course of the winter months^ the method 
of pickling which, has already been spokea 
of in No^s 1, 2, 3, and the iaution under 
No 4* Before fly time in the spring, 
make flannel bags rntb which put and tie 
up closely your dried beef and hang up in 
a dry cool place. 

No 272. To keep Hams in the summer. 
There are yarious methods,' but thejnost 
sure is, before fly time, to roll each nfria 
a cloth or wrap faithfully in swingle'TOw, 
and lay down in a barrel packed in' char- 
coal some broken, so as io pack close, 
or common house ashes. ^^^^^^1^^ 
completely covered ^gjd enclosed oi^s'aU, 
sidesj^to guard against the ingress of flies, 
and you have nothing else to fear. 

There is another way which we have 
known to succeed for several years in suc- 
cession, and the philosophy of thf process 
is good: Before fly time in the spring 
make a bag for each ham out of good thick 
factory cloth, dipit ib strong salt and water 
and dry, altet^nately, for three or four timt^s, 
wheit. put in your han\s, tie up close, and 
hang up in a dry cool place. The cloth 
becomes saturated with salt, which on dry- 
ing, chrystalizes, and forms an impervious 
barrier to flies and is quite air tight.

set to the goods, as follows : Tifce the 
three ounces alum, break fine, and the one

madder, break fine, put into same kind of
