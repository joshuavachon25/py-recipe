FOREWORD 

Mr. Thurston's conception of a text book on chem- 
istry to meet the needs of chemists engaged in the 
analysis of foods and drugs has appealed to me. His 
ideas of the incontrovertible data the backing needed 
by chemists engaged in such analysis were born of 
experience long and intensely practical. In this assem- 
blage of data, which he built up around him, and with 
which he fortified himself in his work, I, an onlooker, 
find, at the close of his life of uprightness and usefulness, 
factors that contributed so highly to his success. The 
pages of this book contain the very essence of all that 
others know on the subjects treated. And to the knowl- 
edge of others Mr. Thurston has liberally contributed 
from his own. 

As a friend of the author I have had real pleasure in 
assisting the publishers in the final preparation of the 
pages.

PREFACE. 

This Manual has been the outgrowth of the Author's connection 
as Chemist for the past seventeen years with the Ohio Dairy and Food 
Department and the Ohio Agricultural Department, Division of Dairy 
and Foods. 

Originally it was designed to include a wider range of subjects in 
this volume, but after the work was under way it was decided that it 
would be best to consider only the Oils, Fats and Waxes, and allied 
substances, in reference to their constants when pure, their adulter- 
ants, and the standard methods for the determination of said adul- 
terants. A subsequent volume is being prepared to make the work a 
complete guide to the analysis of the more common drugs and foods. 
It is of prime importance to the analyst to know what adulterants 
are being used; therefore, there has been included the analyses of 
substances that appear in the Federal Notices of Judgment published 
to January 1, 1920, so far as they have a bearing on the subjects 
treated in this work. 

An attempt has been made to compile the bibliographies of sub- 
stances treated in this volume from original sources, covering the 
prominent American and English chemical journals to January 1, 
1922. All original articles appearing in these journals are included 
regardless of their importance. Abstracts and reviews from other 
publications are not generally included. It will be noticed that the 
titles of some of the articles do not have any apparent reference to the 
subjects under which they appear, but upon examination it will be 
found that they have some bearing upon the same. 
The Journals completely covered are the following: 

American Chemical Journal. 

Analyst, London. 

Journal of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists. 

Journal of the Society of Chemical Industry, London. 

Journal of the American Chemical Society. 

Journal of the American Pharmaceutical Association. 

Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. 

American Journal of Pharmacy. 

Pharmaceutical Review. 

Journal of the Chemical Society, London. 



vi PREFACE. 

It appears to the author that complete bibliographies of certain 
journals, covering the subjects treated, will be of greater value to the 
student and research chemist than a large number of miscellaneous 
references.

CHAPTER I. 
POLARISCOPE. 

The Use of the Polariscope in Pharmaceutical and Food Analysis. 

Optical rotation, as a method of determining the purity of sub- 
stances, was not recognized in the United States Pharmacopoeia until 
1890. 

At present there are known to be over one thousand optically active 
substances, chiefly from the vegetable or animal organism. In the 
latest edition of the United States Pharmacopoeia the optical rotation 
of over fifty substances has been considered. 

A brief statement in reference to optical rotation as applied to the 
analysis of drugs and foods will be considered. 

In addition to what may be found in the Pharmacopoeia, it will be 
advisable to add a condensed statement describing apparatus, reagents 
and the methods of making proper polariscopic examinations of dif- 
ferent substances, as this subject has only been briefly considered, if 
at all, in works on pharmacy. 

A polariscope has been defined as an instrument for exhibiting or 
measuring the polarization of light, or of examining substances in 
polarized light. 

Polarization is defined by the Pharmacopoeia as follows: In a ray 
of ordinary light the transverse vibrations take place indifferently in 
any plane about the line of propagation. When these waves are 
limited to a single plane they are termed polarized and the phenom- 
enon is known as polarization. 

There are a number of makes of polariscopes, as, Schmidt and 
Haensch, Wild, Laurent, Landolt-Lippich, Duboscq, Soleil-Ventzke, 
etc. 

They are called polariscopes, polaristrobometers, saccharimeters, 
and polarimeters. They should be provided with 25, 50, 100 and 400 
millimeter observation tubes. 

The Schmidt and Haensch instruments are in common use in this 
country, although other polariscopes are used to a limited extent. 
With the majority of instruments, ordinary white or sodium light is 
used. A coal oil lamp, a gas jet or an acetylene lamp may be used as 
the source of light.

The different makes of instruments are provided with verniers or 
scales, some reading in circular degrees, some direct percentages, as the 
Ventzke or so-called sugar scale, while others are provided with two 
scales, one for circular degrees and one for percentages or degrees on 
the sugar scale. 



POLARISCOPE, 3 

The scales of the different instruments are based upon the number 
of grams of pure cane sugar dissolved in water to make 100 cc.* In 
most instruments this is 26.048 grams; that is, when 26.048 grams of 
pure cane sugar are dissolved in a sufficient quantity of water at 17.5 
to make 100 cc., and polarized in a 200 millimeter tube, this establishes 
the 100 mark (100 Ventzke) of the polariscope. The amount of 
sugar necessary for different instruments is what is termed the normal 
weight for the polariscope used. With most apparatus 26.048 grams is 
the normal weight; for Soleil-Duboscq 16.35 grams; for Laurent 16.19 
grams, and for Wild, usually 10 to 20 grams. 

In the determination of sugar, if the polarization is made with a 
100 millimeter tube the result should be doubled, and if a 400 milli- 
meter tube is used the reading should be divided by two. 




FIG. 4. Polariscope for Reading the 
Angle of Rotation of a Substance. 



FIG. 5. Vernier for Reading Degrees 
of Rotation. 



The Alidade to the right and left of the index zero are divided so that 10 divisions 
on the scale equal 9 on the circle, which permits a direct reading to one-tenth degree. 
In above Fig. 5 the zero of the vernier does not quite reach the third degree mark on 
the circle to the right, and the sixth vernier mark is the first one which makes a 
coincidence. The alidade reading is, therefore, + 2.6 . 1 

By specific rotary power is understood the angle of rotation which 
a liquid would produce if it contained in one cc. one gram of active 
substance, and opposed a column one decimeter in length to the 
passage of the polarized ray. The specific rotary power is represented 
by the symbol (a) and when a homogeneous yellow light, corresponding 
to the Fraunhofer line D is employed, in the observation, the specific 
rotation is represented by (O)D> The temperature should also be 
observed, and by International agreement the temperature is fixed at

20 C.; however the United States Pharmacopoeia gives the reading 
of all volatile oils at 25 C. and sugar solutions, only, at 20 C. In 
case of an oil or other substance which is polarized at 25 C. in a 
100 mm. tube, the angular rotation would be represented thus: amv, 
and if observed at 20 C., it should be indicated as follows: dozr- 

The Pharmacopoeia gives formulas for calculating the specific 
rotary power of an optically active liquid substance, and a solution of 
an optically active solid as follows : 

1. For Liquid Substances: 

_ 10 X a 

2. For Solutions of Solids: 

_ 10000 X a 
~ L X p X d 
or 

_ 10000 X a 
L X c 

For calculating these formulas the determination of the following 
factors is necessary: 

a = The angle of rotation of the liquid or solid observed with sodium 
light. 

L = The length of the tube in millimeters. 

d = The density of the active liquid or solution. 

p = The amount of active substance in 100 parts by weight of the 
solution. 

c = The number of grams of active substance in 100 cc. of the 
solution. 

It will be noticed by the above that the specific rotary power 
(gyrodynat) of a substance changes with the degree of concentration, 
with the temperature, and with the color of the light. The Phar- 
macopoeia recognizes only yellow monochromatic light. 

Substances are said to be optically active which possess the property 
of rotating through a certain angle the plane of polarization of a ray 
of polarized light which passes through them. 

Active bodies are either dextrorotatory, represented by the sign +, 
or d } or levorotatory, represented by the sign or I, according to 
the direction in which the rotation of the plane of polarization takes 
place. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia recognizes substances as being : 

(a) Dextro-rotatory; 
(6) Levo-rotatory; 
(c) Optically inactive. 



POLARISCOPE. 5 

The official dextrorotatory substances are as follows: 

Camphora. When 10 grams of camphor are dissolved in a sufficient 
quantity of 95 per cent, (by volume) alcohol to make 100 cc. it should 
have a specific rotation, at 25 C., of from + 41 to + 42 in a 200 
mm. tube. 

Cinchoninae Sulphas. Is dextrorotatory in aqueous solutions. 

Glucosum. Is dextrorotatory, before and after inversion, in aqueous 
solutions. 

Commercial Glucose. In the absence of appreciable amounts of 
invert sugar may be estimated by the following formula: 

(a - S) 100 



in which G = per cent, of commercial glucose; 
a = Direct polarization; 
S = Per cent, of sugar. 
Express the results in terms of commercial glucose polarizing + 175 V. 

To determine glucose in substances containing invert sugar prepare 
an inverted half-normal solution of the substance. Make the cool 
solution neutral to phenolphthalein with sodium hydroxide solution, 
slightly acidify with hydrochloric acid, and treat with 5 to 10 cc. of 
alumina cream before making up to the mark. Filter and polarize 
at 87 C. in a 200 mm. jacketed tube. Multiply the reading by 200 
and divide the factor by 163 to express the amount of glucose present 
in terms of glucose polarizing + 175 V. 

Multirotation. When the rotating power of a solution of a substance 
becomes different on standing, either increasing or decreasing, the 
phenomenon is called multirotation or bi-rotation. 

Bi-Rotation. Wiley 1 states that some sugars in fresh solution show 
a gyrodynat much higher than the normal, and some lower. Dex- 
trose, maltose and lactose show bi-rotation in a marked degree. By 
standing a few hours, or boiling, or adding a small amount of ammonia 
the bi-rotation will disappear. 

The rotation of an aqueous solution of invert sugar becomes zero 
at from 87.2 C. to 88 C. This is due to the diminution of the 
levorotatory power of levulose with the elevation of temperature until 
it equalizes the dextrorotatory power of dextrose. 

The glucose in common mixtures of sucrose and glucose may be 
determined by polarization of the inverted solution at 87 C. as the 
invert sugar will be inactive at that temperature.

6 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Oleum Amygdalae Amarae. Is inactive or dextrorotatory, not 
exceeding + 10' in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Aurantii. Optical rotation not less than + 94 in 100 mm. 
tube at 25 C. (absence of oil of turpentine, etc.). Lythgoe's reading 
in a 100 mm. tube is + 272.8 V. 1 

Oleum Cari. The optical rotation varies from + 70 to + 80 in a 
100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Cassiae. Should probably be in a class by itself as its 
optical rotation may vary not more than 1 dextrogyrate or levogyrate 
in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Coriandri. The optical rotation varying from -f- 8 to 
+ 13 in a 100 mm. tube at a temperature of 25 C. 

Oleum Eucalypti. The optical rotation is not given in the United 
States Pharmacopoeia IX, but in the United States Pharmacopoeia 
VIII it is stated to be dextrogyrate, the angle of rotation being not 
more than + 10 in a 100 mm. tube at a temperature of 25 C. Smith 2 
gives the rotation of a sample of eucalyptus oil examined in a 100 mm. 
tube as + 4.47. The writer examined a sample that was optically 
inactive. 

Gildemeister and Hoffman 3 allege the more eucalyptol the oil con- 
tains the lower its rotatory power, which is given as + 1 to + 15. 

Oleum Foeniculi. The optical rotation varies from + 12 to + 24 
in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Limonis. The angle of rotation of oil of lemon varies from 
+ 57 to + 64 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. Lythgoe 1 gives the 
reading from a large number of samples, as + 175.0 V. in a 100 mm. 
tube. 

A commercial sample examined by the writer had an optical rotation 
of + 63.31 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Myristicae. The angle of rotation varies between +12 
and + 30 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. Lythgoe's 1 reading is + 45.7 
V. in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. Leach 4 reports (a) D = 14 to + 28 
in a 100 mm. tube. 

Oleum Sassafras. The angle of rotation varies from + 3 to + 4 
in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Saccharum. When 26.048 grams of pure sugar are dissolved in a 
sufficient quantity of water to make 100 cc. and polarized in a 200 mm. 
tube at 25 C. the reading should be 100 V. Commercial samples 
will generally read a little less owing to impurities they contain. Ac-

cording to the U.S. P. the specific rotation of sugar, determined at 
20 C., in a solution of distilled water, containing in 100 cc. the equiv- 
alent of 26 grams of sugar, previously dried to a constant weight at 
105 C., and using a 200 mm. tube, is not less than 65.9. 

Saccharum Lactis. The specific rotation (a) D of sugar of milk, 
determined at 25 C., in a solution in distilled water, containing in 
100 cc. the equivalent of 10 grams and using a 200 mm. tube, is from 
+ 52.2 to + 52.5. 

Strophanthinum. Its solutions are dextrorotatory. 

Terebenum. Its optical rotation does not exceed + 0.3 in a 100 
mm. tube at 25 C. (unaltered oil of turpentine). 

The Official Levogyrate or Levorotatory Substances are as follows: 

Cinchonidinae Sulphas. In aqueous solutions is levorotatory. 

Cocainae Hydrochloridum. Is levogyrate in aqueous solutions. 

Codeina. Is levogyrate in aqueous solutions. 

Hyoscyaminae Hydrobromidum. Is levogyrate in aqueous solu- 
tions. 

CLARIFICATION. 

In the examination of the substances above enumerated it has not 
been necessary to make any special preparation for polarization. The 
oils are simply examined in a 50 or 100 mm. observation tube by placing 
the same in the polariscope and making the usual reading in a dark 
room. The source of light used in polarizing should be in another 
room and admitted through a circular opening in the partition. 

There are a number of especially constructed lamps for polariscopic 
work, using ordinary gas, kerosene, or acetylene gas, also an electric 
light illuminating apparatus, but very satisfactory observations are 
made by the use of the ordinary flat wick oil lamp. The lamp should 
be placed a distance of not less than 200 mm. from the polarizing end 
of the instrument. 

In case of solids they are dissolved in the proper menstruum and 
examined in the usual manner. 

As a number of substances have to be clarified before polarization, 
the consideration of the necessary reagents and methods of examina- 
tion will be taken up under the next heading as it will be necessary 
to apply the same methods in the examination of other substances. 

Mel and Mel Depuratum. They are levogyrate. With honey it is 
necessary to first clarify the sample before the polarization can be 
made. Alumina cream and basic lead acetate solution are used as 
clarifiers and as the polarization is preceded by clarification to secure 
accurate results, the method of preparing the above reagents will be 
cons dered. 



8 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Alumina Cream acts mechanically carrying out suspended matters 
only. It is prepared as follows: Treat a solution of alum with slight 
excess of ammonia. Wash the precipitate of aluminum hydroxide on 
a filter, until neutral reaction. The aluminum hydroxide is suspended 
in water to produce a creamy liquid. 

Solution of Basic Lead Acetate acts as a clarifying agent by uniting 
with organic acids and throwing out of solution organic substances, 
and these precipitates act mechanically removing suspended matter 
in solution. Solution of basic lead acetate is prepared by boiling for 
one-half hour, 464 grams of lead acetate and 264 grams of litharge 
with 1500 cc. of water. Cool the solution, dilute to two liters, allow 
to settle and the decanted solution will be ready to use. 

In place of the above, the official Liquor Plumbi Subacetatis may 
be used. 

Charcoal and Fuller's Earth are very satisfactory clarifiers in certain 
cases. 

In preparing honey for polarization weigh 26.048 grams into a 
counterpoised dish and dissolve the sample in about 60 cc. of water, 
then transfer to a 100 cc. sugar flask and add 10 cc. of alumina cream 
and sufficient water to make 100 cc. Filter and polarize in a 200 mm. 
tube. Honey should always give a levogyrate reading, if pure, al- 
though it has been stated 1 that honey collected from coniferous trees 
is dextrorotatory. According to an extensive investigation by Selser 2 
it appears to be a safe statement that all unadulterated honey rotates 
the plane of polarization to the left. 

When honey is dextrogyrate it may be adulterated with sucrose or 
glucose. It is then necessary to invert the sample and polarize. If, 
after inversion, it is dextrorotatory it contains glucose; if it is levo- 
rotatory it would indicate sucrose. 

It must not be understood that unadulterated honey does not con- 
tain sucrose, as it always contains a small amount, but not enough to 
polarize to the right. 

The inversion is made as follows : 

Fill a 50 cc. sugar flask with the filtrate, as prepared for direct 
polarization, and add 5 cc. concentrated hydrochloric acid; heat on a 
water bath to 68 C. It should be heated at a rate to require about 
fifteen minutes to reach this temperature. It is convenient to use 
the regular sugar flasks marked 50 and 55 cc., also 100 and 110 cc. 
Proper correction should be made for the dilution with acid .

a = Polarization-direct reading. 
6 = Polarization-invert reading. 
T = Temperature at which readings are made. 

In case the direct polarization is to the right and the invert polariza- 
tion is. to the left, the sum of the two readings is taken. Whenever 
both polarizations are to the right or left then the difference is taken.

10 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Oleum Gaultheria. See methyl salicylate. A commercial sample 
examined by the writer was optically inactive. Leach 1 states that 

011 of wintergreen is slightly levorotatory, 0.0 25' to 1.5. 
Oleum Juniperi. Varies from to - 15 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 

C. A commercial sample gave 1.5 V. 

Oleum Lavandulae. The optical rotation varies from 1 to 
- 10 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Menthae Piperitae. Optical rotation varies between 23 
and - 33 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. Todd 2 states that the average 
optical rotation of oil of peppermint in a 200 mm. tube should be 
50.2. Lythgoe 3 gives 79.7 V. as the polarization in a 100 mm. 
tube. Gildemeister and Hoffman 4 states the optical rotation of the 
oil produced in the different countries varies and the American oil 
should have a reading of 32 0'. 

Oleum Menthae Viridis. The optical rotation varies between 38 
and - 55 in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Pimentae. The optical rotation varies from to 4 in a 
100 mm. tube at 25 C. 

Oleum Rosmarini. Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C. 
(Parry) -9 to 18. 

Oleum Santali. The optical rotation varies from 15 to 20 
in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C. (absence of other varieties of sandal-wood 
oil, etc.). 

Oleum Thymi. Slightly levorotatory. 

Quinina. Levorotatory in alcoholic solutions. 

Salicinum. The aqueous solution is levorotatory. 

Santoninum. Its solution are levorotatory. 

Scopolaminae Hydrobromidum. The optical rotation determined

rotatory. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia contains substances that are men- 
tioned as optically inactive as follows:

many other volatile oils. 

Eugenol. Inactive; distinction from oil of cloves which is slightly 
levorotatory.

POLARISCOPE. 11 

Oleum Betulae. Is official under the title Methyl Salicylate and 
is said to be optically inactive. Lythgoe, 1 however, states that this 
oil, prepared from sweet birch, polarizes in a 100 mm. tube 0.1 V. 

Oleum Sinapis Volatile. Is optically inactive. 

Thymol. This occurs in oil of thyme, which is slightly levorotatory. 

The optical activity of a number of official substances and prepara- 
tions has not been mentioned in the United States Pharmacopoeia 
and in some cases the polariscopic examination is a convenient and 
rapid method of detecting adulteration, therefore such substances will 
now be considered. 

Camphora Monobromata. Optical rotation + 40. 

Cocaina. Is dextrogyrate. 

Codeinae Sulphas. Is levogyrate in aqueous solution. 

Linimentum Camphorae. The camphor may be estimated ac- 
cording to Cook 2 by polarization. The reading in a 200 mm. tube at 
25 C. is + 58.5 V. for official camphor liniment, which indicates one 
per cent, camphor for each 2.925 V. By using this factor the per- 
centage of camphor in any sample may be readily calculated by 
polarization. 

The official camphor liniment is prepared with cotton-seed oil. 
It is stated 3 when olive oil is used a one per cent, solution of camphor 
gives a polarization of + 1 in a 200 mm. tube when observed with a 
Schmidt and Haensch polariscope. This is practically the same 
reading as reported by Cook when cottonseed oil is used. 

Linimentum Saponis. This liniment consists of soap, camphor, 
oil of rosemary, alcohol and water. Camphor and oil of rosemary are 
dextrogyrate and the liniment turns the plane of polarization to the 
right. The reading in a 200 mm. tube at 25 C. should be about 
+ 9 V. From this we are unable to determine the absolute per- 
centage of camphor or oil of rosemary, as a sufficient amount of either 
would give the above reading. On the other hand, a deficiency of 
either would give a lower reading and indicate a shortage of one or 
the other or both substances. 

Morphina. Is levogyrate in alcoholic solution. 

Morphinae Sulphas. Is levogyrate in aqueous solution. 

Oleum Lini. Is slightly levogyrate 4 and in the case of strong devia- 
tion of the polarized light to the right would indicate the presence of 
rosin oil. Bishop 5 states it is also necessary to test for sesame oil in 
case the polarization is to the right.

12 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Oleum Olivae. Is slightly dextrogyrate. 

Oleum Terebinthinae. The American oil of turpentine obtained 
from Pinus palustris and the English oil of turpentine from Pinus 
australis are dextrorotatory. Commercial oil examined gave + 13 V. 
in a 200 mm. tube at 25 C. The writer examined two samples of 
pine oil, or the so-called oil of turpentine, distilled from the wood of 
pine stumps, and the readings in 200 mm. tube at 25 C. were 27 V. 
and 30 V. Long 1 examined oil of turpentine distilled from the 
crude liquid exudatidn of the spruce pine (Pinus glabra) and the angle 
of rotation in a 200 mm. tube varied from - 64.750 to - 70.333. 
German and Russian oil of turpentine, obtained from the turpentine 
of Pinus sylvestris; Venetian oil of turpentine, obtained from Laix 
Europoea, and French oil of turpentine, obtained from Pinus maritima, 
are all levorotatory. 

Pilocarpinae Hydrochloridum. Aqueous and alcoholic solutions are 
dextrogyrate. 

Pilocarpinae Nitras. Is dextrogyrate in aqueous or alcoholic 
solutions. 

Quininae Bisulphas. Is levorotatory in aqueous or alcoholic 
solutions. 

Quininae Sulphas. Is levorotatory in aqueous or alcoholic solu- 
tions. 

Spiritus Camphor ae. Holderman 2 calls attention to the fact that 
each angular degree of dextrogyration in spirit of camphor corre- 
sponds to one per cent, by weight of camphor. Or, in other words, 
the U. S. P. spirit of camphor should rotate the plane of polarization 
to the right, and in round numbers + 10 (9.6). If a 200 mm. 
tube is used the reading on the Ventzke scale should be + 28.80 
(27.94). The reading on the Ventzke scale divided by the factor 
2.88 (2.76) will give the percentage by weight of the camphor present 
in spirit of camphor. 

Spiritus Menthae Piperitae. Should polarize - 15.9 V. in a 200 
mm. tube at 25 C. Polarize the essence without dilution in a 200 
mm. tube at 25 C., using the sugar scale. Divide the reading by 
1.59, and if other optically active substances are absent, the result 
will be the percentage of peppermint oil. 

Syrupus. The percentage of sugar in syrup may be determined by 
weighing into a sugar flask 26.048 grams of the syrup; make up to 
100 cc. with water; polarize in a 200 mm. tube at 25 C., and the reading 
on the Ventzke scale will give the direct percentage of sugar in the 
syrup, which should be 64.5 per cent.

POLARISCOPE. 13 

Vinum Album. Although this is not recognized in the United 
States Pharmacopoeia, it will be considered here. Bigelow 1 gives the 
polarization of wine as follows: 

(1) The Wine Shows No Rotation. 

"This may be due to the absence of any rotary body, or to the simultaneous pres- 
ence of dextrorotatory and levorotatory sugars. 

"(a) The wine is inverted: A levorotation shows that the sample contains cane 
sugar. 

"(6) The wine is fermented: A dextrorotation shows that both levorotatory sugar 
and unfermentable constituents of commercial dextrose are present. 

"If no change takes place in either (a) or (6) in the rotation, it proves absence of 
unfermented cane sugar, the unfermented constituents of commercial dextrose, and 
levorotatory sugar. 

(2) The Wine Rotates to the Right. 

"This may be caused by unfermented cane sugar, commercial glucose, or both. 
" (a) The wine is inverted. 

" (i) It rotates to the left after inversion : Unfermented cane sugar is present. 

"(a 2 ) It rotates more than 2.3 to the right: Commercial glucose or its unfer- 
mentable constituents are present. 

" (a 3 ) It rotates less than 2.3 and more than 0.9 to the right: It is in this case 
treated as follows: 

"Two hundred and ten cc. of the wine are evaporated to about one-third its vol- 
ume to remove alcohol, cooled, diluted with water to the original volume, and fer- 
mented, after evaporating the alcohol, with one to two grams of pressed yeast. The 
fermented liquid is evaporated in a porcelain dish to a thin sirup with a little sand 
and a few drops of a 20 per cent, solution of potassium acetate added. To the residue 
200 cc. of 90 per cent, alcohol are added, with constant stirring. The alcoholic 
solution is filtered into a flask, and the alcohol removed by distillation until about 
5 cc. remain. The residue is mixed with washed bone-black, filtered into a gradu- 
ated cylinder, and washed until the filtrate amounts to 30 cc. When the filtrate 
shows a dextrorotation of more than 1.5 it indicates the presence of the unferment- 
able constituents of commercial glucose. 

(3) The Wine Rotates to the Left. 

"It contains unfermented levorotatory sugar, derived either from the must or 
from the inversion of added cane sugar. It may, however, also contain unfermented 
cane sugar and the unfermentable constituents of commercial glucose. 
" (a) The wine is fermented. 

" (i) It polarizes 3 after fermentation. It contains only levorotatory sugar. 

" (a 2 ) It rotates to the right. It contains both levorotatory sugar and the un- 
fermentable constituents of commercial dextrose. 
" (6) The wine is inverted. 

" (61) It is more strongly levorotatory after inversion. It contains both levo- 
rotatory sugar and unfermented cane sugar." 

If after inversion the wine shows a reading to the right, glucose has 
been added, but if inversion changes the polarization to the left cane

sugar has been added, and the amount can be calculated by the appli- 
cation of Clerget's formula. 

Spirits of Lemon and Orange (Lemon and Orange Extracts). 
Without diluting, polarize the extract at 20 C. in a 200 mm. tube. 
Divide the reading in degrees Ventzke by 3.2 in the case of lemon ex- 
tract and by 5.2 in the case of orange extract; in the absence of other 
optically active substances the result will be the percentage of oil by 
volume. 1 The author has examined a large number of commercial 
extracts of lemon and found the reading varying from 0.0 to + 24.5 V, 
and in some cases the polarization indicated the proper amount of 
lemon oil when there was very little present ; the optical activity being 
due to sucrose, and, as stated above, this method of determining the 
oil of lemon or orange in extracts is not final until the absence of 
other optically active substances has been proven.

CHAPTER II. 



REFRACTOMETERS. 

The Abbe Refractometer, with heatable prisms, is generally used to 

determine the refractive index of substances such as oils, fats, waxes, etc. 

The instrument consists of two prisms of flint glass, cemented in 

two hinged metal cases. The metal cases are hollow and arranged so 

as to run warm water through them. With one case is connected a 

thermometer, the mercury bulb extend- 
ing into the case. Special water-heat- 
ing arrangements may be purchased 
with the instruments. In the examina- 
tion of a substance the hinged mounted 
prisms are opened and one or two drops 
of the liquid, or a small portion of a solid, 
is placed upon one prism and then the 
prisms are closed and locked by a set- 
screw. Water is then run through until 
the thermometer indicates the tempera- 
ture desired. This temperature should 
be maintained about thirty minutes. 
The instrument is now rotated towards 
the observer and the mirror adjusted to 
reflect the light upon the prisms. The 
instrument is provided with a movable 
arm, to the left, which rotates the prisms. This is brought towards 
the observer until the upper portion of the field (observed through 
the eyepiece) appears bright and the lower portion dark. The 
dividing line should be brought exactly to the intersection of the 
crossed lines shown in the field. There will usually be a band of color 
noticeable which must be changed to a colorless line before the read- 
ing is taken. This is done by rotating the screw-head on the right 
of the telescope until the dispersions are neutralized, making the line 
sharp. The position of the pointer on the graduation of the sector is 
then read by aid of the magnifier attached to the alidade. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia directs that the reading shall be 
made at 20 C. This is in case of liquids. The refractive index of 
solid fats should be made above their melting points and, for uni- 
formity, at 40 C.; and waxes at 65 to 75 C.

To abbreviate, 

fl-z>2oc. = refractive index at 20 C.; 
ttD4oc. = refractive index at 40 C., etc. 

Wiley 1 gives 0.000176 as the factor for each degree C. to use in 
reducing the result of refractive index taken at different temperature 
than the standard. If 20 C. is taken as the standard and the reading 
is made at 28 C. there should be added 0.000176 X 8 or 0.001408. 
This factor does not hold except for butter fat. 

Tolman and Munson 2 state the correction in the refractive index for 
ordinary fats and oils is very uniform, about 0.000365 for 1 C.

This instrument consists of a tube 
about fifteen inches in length, including 
the prism at the lower end and the 
ocular at the top. Near the top is a 
vernier, (regulated by a screw), on 
which is an arbitrary scale by which 
may be read the degree of refraction. 

The scale of this instrument reads 
from 5 to 105, corresponding to in- 
dices of refraction of from 1.32539 to 
1.36640. Tables have been published 
of indices of refraction corresponding to 
scale readings from to 100, as f olloi ^s :

A metal, ground glass-bottomed water bath, with mirror, is furnished 
as part of the outfit with the instrument; also a wire support to hold 
the refractometer at the proper height to permit the immersion of the 
prism into any of the small beakers, held in the metal rack of the water 
bath, containing the solutions to be tested. The water is maintained 
at a proper temperature by the flow of water the same as when using 
the Abbe refractometer, the control thermometer being immersed in 
the water bath. The beakers containing the solutions to be examined 
should remain in the bath before examination until their contents are 
of the same temperature as the water in the bath. For the examination 
of very small quantities of substances or very dark solutions a metal, 
glass-bottomed beaker is furnished, which may be attached directly 
to the instrument. 

The dispersion is controlled by a compound prism which is operated 
by turning a collar one way or the other until a clear line is observed 
across the scale. Tenths of degrees are read by a graduated vernier 
screw near the top of the instrument. 

The immersion refractometer is used in the examination of milk 
serum, as described under " Watered Milk"; the determination of 
methyl alcohol and methyl and ethyl alcohol when mixed; also, per- 
centage strength of aqueous solutions of chemicals, formaldehyde, 
cane sugar, etc. 



20 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Methyl Alcohol is often used in the manufacture of medicinal prepar- 
ations in place of ethyl alcohol and in such cases very serious results 
are often produced. Many States have enacted laws prohibiting the 
use of methyl alcohol in the manufacture of medicinal products. 

It has been frequently used in making the cheaper grades of bay rum 
and the writer remembers a case very well, where a barber's son drank 
bay rum, prepared with methyl alcohol, which resulted in his death. 

Methyl alcohol has been used quite extensively in the preparation 
of veterinary liniments, flavoring extracts; and in the preparation of 
tincture of iodine and many galenicals, such as tincture of arnica. 

Even the external application of preparations containing methyl 
alcohol will sometimes produce blindness, and it should never be used 
in medicine either intern-ally or externally. 

The test for the presence of methyl alcohol generally used is con- 
ducted as follows: Distill, in the regular manner, so as to obtain a 
clear solution. Take 5 cc. in a large test tube and oxidize the alcohol 
by plunging into it several times a spiral of copper wire heated to 
redness. Formaldehyde will be formed (in case of methyl alcohol), 
which may be proven by the following tests : 

Resorcin Test. Add 1 drop of a 0.5 per cent, aqueous solution of 
resorcin and pour, without mixing, on top of a little concentrated 
sulphuric acid in a test tube. On contact, if formaldehyde is present, 
a red ring appears. 

Hehner's Test. Used for detecting formaldehyde in milk, may be 
applied as follows: Mix 5 cc. of the distillate with an equal amount 
of the milk and pour commercial concentrated sulphuric acid down 
the side of the tube so it forms a layer at the bottom without mixing 
with the milk. A violet zone will be produced at the junction of the two 
liquids if formaldehyde is present. The color will not be produced un- 
less an iron salt is present, therefore, commercial sulphuric acid should 
be used. If pure acid only, is available, add a drop of ferric chloride. 

Morphine Sulphuric Acid Test. Add to a few drops of the oxidized 
solution, one or two drops of a solution of morphine in concentrated 
sulphuric acid. This will produce a deep violet color in case for- 
maldehyde is present. 

In applying these tests for methyl alcohol the fact must not be over- 
looked that if ethyl alcohol is present it will be simultaneously oxidized 
to acetaldehyde and will respond to the tests for formaldehyde. Scudder 1 
calls attention to this fact and states that in case of acetaldehyde with 
the Resorcin Test the flocks of color vary from yellow to brown. 

Jones has reviewed this subject in detail and his article will be 
found in the Analyst. 2

REFRACTOMETERS. 



21 



Methyl alcohol in commercial work is determined almost exclusively 
with an immersion refractometer. This is sometimes called a dipping 
refractometer. The prism of the instrument is immersed directly 
in the solution and the degree of refraction read on an arbitrary scale. 
The degree of accuracy of the reading of the refractive index is much 
greater on the immersion refractometer than on the Abbe instrument. 

In the determination of methyl alcohol, with the immersion re- 
fractometer, make the usual distillation and then take the specific 
gravity of the distillate at 15.6 C., and from the alcohol tables obtain 
the percentage of alcohol by weight. One of the small beakers is 
filled about half full with the distillate at 20 C. and the prism of the 
refractometer is dipped into it. The ocular is focused upon the di- 
visions of the scale by turning the milled zone of the ocular shell until 
lines and numbers are seen quite distinctly. Adjust the mirror so 
that the bright sky is seen directly through the beaker. When methyl 
alcohol is added to ethyl alcohol the refraction decreases in direct 
proportion to the amount present. 

From the table following ascertain the percentage of methyl alcohol.

22 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The quantitative calculation is made by interpolation in the table 
using the figures for pure ethyl and methyl alcohol of the same alcoholic 
strength. Leach 1 gives the following example: 

"Suppose the distillate made up to the original volume of the 
measured portion taken for alcohol determination has a specific 
gravity of 0.9736, corresponding to 18.38 per cent, alcohol by weight, 
and has a refraction of 35.8 at 20 C. by immersion refractometer; 
by interpolation in the refractometer table the readings of ethyl and 
methyl alcohol corresponding to 18.38 per cent, alcohol are 47.2 and 
25.4 respectively, the difference being 21.8; 47.2 - 35.8 = 11.4; (11.4 
divided by 21.8) 100 = 52.3; showing 52.3 per cent, of the alcohol 
present is methyl alcohol."

CHAPTER III. 
SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 

Specific Gravity has been defined as the ratio of the weight of a body 
to that of an equal volume of some standard substance water in the 
case of solids and liquids, air or hydrogen in the case of gases. 

In other words, the true specific gravity of a substance would be 
its weight at 4 C., compared with an equal volume of water at the 
same temperature; however, the specific gravities reported in the 
United States Pharmacopoeia IX are on a basis of water at 25 C., 
and substances weighed at the same temperature are represented thus : 
25 C./25 C. 

Unless otherwise stated, in this work the temperature referred to as 
normal will be 25 C. for all substances except alcohol, which will be 
at 15.6 C. compared with water at the same temperature 

The United States Pharmacopoeia has established 25 C. as the 
temperature at which specific gravity of all substances should be 
compared, except for alcohol, which should be reported at 15.56 C., 
or practically 15.6 C., compared with water at the same temperature. 
This is the standard temperature established by the United States 
Revenue Department for taking the specific gravity of alcohol. 

If specific gravities are reported at 25 C. compared with water at 
its greatest density (4 C.), they should be represented thus: 25 C./ 
4C. In case of alcohol, which is determined at 15.6 C. for reasons 
stated above, and compared with water at the same temperature, it 
should be represented thus: 15.6 C./15.6 C. 

To abbreviate: the letter "d" represents specific gravity. Specific 
gravity at various temperatures may be represented thus: d(2Q C./ 
4 C.) = specific gravity at 20 C. compared with water at 4 C.; 
d(25 C./25 C.) = specific gravity at 25 C. compared with water 
at 25 C. The specific gravity at any temperature desired may be 
represented in a similar manner. 

It is essential to always report the temperature at which the specific 
gravity is determined, and to be of value, it is just as essential to 
report the temperature of unity referred to. Instead of a single 
number representing the temperature at which the specific gravity 
is taken, a second number should be provided thus: 25 C./25 C., 
20 C./4 C., 15.6 C./15.6 C., the lower number representing the 
temperature at which the specific gravity of water is taken as unity.

To reduce apparent specific gravities in air to absolute specific 
gravities in vacuum, the United States Pharmacopoeia gives the 
following instructions :

Formula for deriving above corrections: Subtract algebraically the 
apparent specific gravity from 1.000 and multiply the remainder by 
0.0011773. It is additive for specific gravities below, subtractive for 
those above 1.000. 

Note: The correction for reducing true to apparent specific gravity 
is found by subtracting algebraically 1.000 from the true specific 
gravity and multiplying the remainder by the factor 0.0011765. It 
is subtractive for specific gravities below, additive for those above 
1.000. 

If it is desired to compare the specific gravity obtained at various 
temperatures it is then necessary to take into consideration the coeffi- 
cient of expansion of the substance being compared. The coefficient 
of expansion is that fraction of a unit volume by which one unit volume 
expands on being heated 1. 

The coefficient of expansion of a number of common oils, fats, and 
waxes given by Holde 2 are as follows:

For example, suppose the specific gravity of a substance at 18 C. 
is 0.9201, what would be the specific gravity at 25 C., the coefficient 
of expansion being 0.000653 for 1 rise in temperature? For 7, the 
difference between 18 and 25, it would then be 0.000653 X 7 = 
0.004571, and the specific gravity, 0.9201, minus the expansion, 
0.004571, would equal 0.9155, or the specific gravity of the substance 
at 25, C. 

The specific gravity of a substance at 29 C. is 0.8934; what would 
it be at 20 C., the coefficient of expansion being 0.000436? The 
difference in temperature being 9, it would then be 0.000436 X 9 = 
0.003924. The specific gravity, 0.8934, plus the expansion, would 
equal 0.8973, or the specific gravity at 20 C. 

The above rule does not apply to water for the reason that when it i s 
heated from to 4 it contracts, and from 4 to higher temperature 
it expands, and since the coefficient of expansion is not uniform it is 
necessary when determining the specific gravity of any other liquid, 
at a temperature either higher or lower than that at which the pycno- 
meter is standardized, to weigh an equal volume of water at the same 
temperature or to refer to tables indicating the weight of one cc. of 
water at different temperatures; then it is simply a matter of calcula- 
tion to determine the weight of water the pycnometer will hold at 
any temperature given in the table on page 39. 



Methods of Determining the Specific Gravity. 

There have been a great number of methods suggested for taking the 
specific gravity of substances, many of very little practical value, 
while others are of considerable merit; however, owing to the great 
number, a selection of what appears of the greatest interest will now 
be considered.

They may be conveniently divided into three classes: 

1. By the use of pycnometers. 

2. By the use of hydrometers. 

3. By the use of the Westphal Balance. 

Determining the Specific Gravity of Liquids. 

The methods of determining the specific gravity of liquids may in 
many cases be conveniently and practically applied to solids; there- 
fore, there cannot be a marked distinction as applied to liquids and 
solids. 

PYCNOMETERS. 

Some form of specific gravity bottle or pycnometer should be em- 
ployed in the most accurate determinations of the specific gravity of 
liquids. Pycnometers have been invented by many investigators, 
and the history and development of a few will be considered. 

Early investigators simply used a small, glass-stoppered bottle 
which was scrupulously cleaned and accurately weighed and then 
filled with distilled water and again weighed to obtain the exact weight 
of distilled water it would hold. The bottle was then emptied of 
water, dried, and filled with the liquid of which the specific gravity 
was desired, and then reweighed, thus obtaining the net weight of the 



28 



PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



liquid. This latter weight, divided by the weight of water would 
give the specific gravity of the liquid compared with water. When 
attention to temperature was taken into consideration very satis- 
factory results were obtained by what might now be considered a 
rather crude method. 

Following the ordinary bottle, the first step in improvement in 
specific gravity bottles was to have the bottle provided with a per- 
forated glass stopper. This was an improvement, but it was soon 
found that it was almost impossible to keep the temperature exact 
while weighing, and the loss by evaporation from the liquid running 
out of the perforation in the stopper caused considerable discrepancy 
in the results. To overcome this change in temperature, Boot 1 con- 
structed a pycnometer with double walls and vacuum, whereby the 
temperature of the liquid in the inner bottle would remain constant 
for some time, even though the temperature of the room was much 
higher than normal. 

Geissler Pycnometer. This pycnometer was 
provided with a thermometer stopper and when 
provided with a capillary overflow side tube, with 
ground glass cap to prevent evaporation, it is the 
most convenient specific gravity bottle so far pro- 
posed for making accurate determinations. The 
cap should have a very small perforation in the top, 
permitting the liquid to expand; otherwise the cap 
is liable to be forced up and the liquid ooze out. 

In ascertaining the specific gravity, the ther- 
mometer and cap are first removed, then the bottle 
is filled with the liquid, which has been previously 
cooled below the temperature at which the specific 
gravity is to be taken. The thermometer is then 
carefully inserted, care being taken that no air 
bubbles remain in the bottle. The pycnometer con- 
taining the liquid is warmed by holding it in the 
hand until the desired temperature is obtained. 
The excess of liquid that exudes from the capillary 
tube is carefully wiped off and the cap put on. 
The weighing may be made immediately, or after the liquid has ac- 
quired room temperature which will obviate the trouble of moisture col- 
lecting on the bottle.

The specific gravity of the liquid will be 23.6771 divided by 22.2748, equals 1.0629. 

For general use a pycnometer holding about 25 cc. is the most 
convenient size; however, where only a small quantity of the liquid 
is obtainable, a pycnometer of 10 cc. capacity may be used. For 
smaller quantities it is advisable to use some form of pipette pycno- 
meter, or a small*Sprengel tube. 




FIG. 10. Sprengel Tube. 

Sprengel Tube. Dr. H. Sprengel 1 read a paper entitled "A Method 
of Determining With Great Exactness the Specific Gravity of Liquids" 
before the Chemical Society (London), April 3, 1873. From this 
date the Sprengel tube, or pycnometer, has been used to more or less 
extent. Many ingenious modifications have been offered by Bousfield, 2 
Hartley and Barrett, 3 Minozzi, 4 Louis 5 and others. 

A description will be given of the modified form that is now generally 
used. The Sprengel pycnometer is a U tube, made of thin glass,

ending in two capillary tubes bent at right angles at their ends, which 
are ground, and provided with two glass caps. One of the capillary 
tubes should have an inner diameter not to exceed 0.5 mm. and bearing 
a mark about equal distance from the angle and end of the tube. The 
other capillary tube should have an inner diameter not to exceed 
0.25 mm. By placing the larger end into the liquid under examination 
and applying suction on the smaller end the tube will be filled. After 
the tube is filled, it should be placed into a water bath of the required 
temperature. It will be observed that the smaller capillary tube 
always remains full and the liquid expands or contracts in the larger 
tube owing to the least resistance. If the meniscus of the liquid is 
beyond the mark on the larger capillary tube, the excess of liquid 
should be extracted by means of a roll of filter paper applied to the 
end of the tube. If the tube contains too little of the liquid it can be 
filled by suction, or it may be touched with a glass rod which has been 
dipped into the liquid. After the volume has been adjusted at the 
temperature at which the specific gravity is to be taken, the glass 
caps are put on the tubes and weighing may then be made at room 
temperature. Sprengel pycnometers may be procured with a ther- 
mometer attached. 

Sprengel's tube can readily be used for ascertaining the specific 
gravity of liquids at the boiling point of water. An Erlenmeyer flask 
makes a convenient water bath, the ends of the Sprengel tube being 
supported by the neck. For the determination of specific gravity of 
quantities as small as 0.20 cc., Mulliken 1 devised a modified form of 
the Sprengel tube which is made by bending a piece of thick-walled 
glass tubing, 28-30 cm. in length, into a form similar to the Sprengel 
tube. 

Squibb's Specific Gravity Bottle. In 1883, Dr. E. R. Squibb 2 
recommended the use of an ordinary 3 or 4 ounce vial, with a small 
tube thermometer, for obtaining the specific gravity of liquids. The 
thermometer is placed into the bottle and the combined weight as- 
certained. The bottle is then nearly filled with distilled water and 
brought to the required temperature with the thermometer resting 
in the bottle. Add water until it reaches the narrow commencement 
of the neck and mark this point with a file. Weigh and subtract the 
tare to obtain the weight of water. The weight of water is the divisor 
to be applied to any other liquid weighed in the same manner. 

Dr. Squibb 3 also called attention to the expansion of glass by heat 
and states the expansion of a 500 cc. flask is about .00002 cc. for each

degree C., and to obtain true specific gravities this should be taken into 
consideration as well as the coefficient of expansion of the liquid under 
examination. However, as the error for the expansion of glass in the 
ordinary range of specific gravity determinations that is up to 25 C. 
is always beyond the third decimal place, it is commonly and 
properly disregarded in every day practice. 

In 1884 1 Dr. Squibb described an improved specific gravity bottle 
which consists of a flask, having a capacity of 500 grams, provided 
with a very carefully and accurately ground stopper of barometer 
tubing, the tubular portion being about eight centimeters long and 
about three millimeters bore. The upper prolongation of this is a 
very much larger tube of about the same length and of about two 
centimeters internal diameter to receive the expanding liquid as the 
apparatus is warmed up to the temperature of the balance case before 
weighing. There are three graduations on the tube, all for 500 grams 
of recently distilled water. Filled to the lowest mark, the flask holds 
500 grams of the water at its greatest density of 4 C. To the second 
mark, it holds the same quantity, but at 15.0 C. and at the upper 
mark it holds the same weight, but at 15.6 C. This bottle was further 
improved 2 by lengthening the tube stopper so that the central channel 
would permit the bottle to hold the volume of water at any tempera- 
ture between 4 and 25 C. The tube between these points is gradu- 
ated to half millimeters or less. A leaden collar is provided to go 
over the neck of the bottle to keep it steady in the bath when regulating 
the temperature. 

Stock's 3 Specific Gravity Pipette. Consists of a ten-cc. pipette 
with a bulb occupying a central position on the stem. The bulb is 
of the usual elongated form, but instead of being cylindrical, it has a 
flat side, which gives it a stable seat on the pan of a balance. It is 
six inches in length and each end of the stem is closed by a ground glass 
cap. The graduation mark is placed one inch below the upper orifice 
of the stem and the cap on the lower end is ground to fit within one 
millimeter of the point. 

Mulliken 4 recommends the use of a one-cc. pipette when only a 
small quantity of the liquid is available. For weighing, he stands the 
pipette in a tube, the tube having been tared together with the pipette. 
It is claimed that this method has an accuracy limit of about a unit

Dr. Fritz Voeller 1 devised a specific gravity bottle which is described 
as follows: It consists of a small bottle of about 50 cc. capacity, having 
an accurately ground stopper to which a thermometer is fused. The 
latter consists of an interior mercury tube (the thermometer proper) 
and an exterior hollow tube having two small orifices near the bottom 
which permit the liquid to be tested to ascend along the mercurial 
column, so that the latter may indicate the true temperature. The 
same outer thermometer tube has a little hole exactly corresponding 
with the hole in the stopper when the latter is turned to meet it. 

When the bottle is to be used it is filled with the liquid to be tested, 
at a temperature somewhat below 15 C.; then the stopper is slowly 
and gradually inserted and turned so that the two orifices in the stopper 
and neck correspond. As the liquid expands while rising to 15 C., 
the surplus will exude through the orifice. The moment that 15 C. 
is reached the stopper is rotated so as to cover the inner hole. The 
outside of the bottle is then thoroughly cleaned and the bottle weighed. 
Its capacity of water at 15 C. being previously known, the specific 
gravity of the liquid is easily calculated. It is understood that any 
other temperature might be used if so desired. 

It is noticeable that this pycnometer is somewhat similar to the 
improved Geissler. The difference being, that no provision is made 
to permit the expansion of the liquid in case of rise of temperature 
after the stopper is rotated to cover the inner hole. 

Wright 2 in 1892 called attention to the great difficulty of taking the 
specific gravity of liquids with pycnometers in common use, owing 
to the change of temperature while weighing the liquid would run 
over and be partly lost by volitilization. To obviate the difficulty 
he used a flat bottomed flask with two necks; one a long narrow tube 
with millimeter scale, the other a ground tubulus into which a stopper 
fits, provided with a thermometer for reading off the temperature of 
the contents of the flask. 

There is a noticeable similarity between Wright's and Geissler's 
pycnometers. 

The Flotation Method. 

Sir Humphry Davy in 1808 first employed this method and de- 
termined the specific gravity of sodium by mixing sassafras oil and 
naphtha in proportions to produce a liquid in which the metal remained 
suspended without sinking or floating. 

The U.S. P. method for the determination of the specific gravity of 
beeswax directs the mixing of four volumes of alcohol in a sufficient

SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 33 

amount of distilled water to make ten volumes. Portions of the 
purified melted wax are dropped into the mixture to determine if 
they sink or rise, then water or alcohol is added until the wax neither 
rises nor sinks and the particles float indifferently in the liquid. The 
specific gravity of the alcoholic solution is then determined with a 
pycnometer. The specific gravity thus obtained will equal the specific 
gravity of the wax. 

Bellmer 1 determines the specific gravity of oils by the flotation 
method by simply dropping the oil into alcohol and then adding water 
until the oil just begins to float. 

Kreidl and Lenk 2 determined the specific gravity of milk by the 
flotation method by substituting a mixture of benzene and chloroform 
for the alcohol and water. 

HYDROMETERS. 

Hydrometers or Aerometers are instruments to determine the 
density or specific gravity of liquids by flotation. They usually con- 
sist of a glass tube from a few decimeters to thirty or forty decimeters 
in length, and ending in two bulbs. The lower, or smaller, bulb 
contains mercury or shot to make it float upright. The better grade 
hydrometers are provided with a thermometer so that the tempera- 
ture at which the specific gravity is taken may be read at the same 
time. 

Faraday 3 states the hydrometer is of great service where hasty 
estimates of only moderate accuracy are required. Squibb 4 states 
that they are very convenient in application, but their results are, at 
best, only rough approximations. 

In commercial work some form of hydrometer is almost universally 
used in the determination of specific gravities. They are called alco- 
holometers, saccharimeters, lactometers, etc., according to their use. 
In their use great care should be taken that they are not greasy, soiled 
or damp before being immersed in the liquid. The hydrometer 
should be allowed to sink into the liquid gradually till at rest, and 
then depressed about an inch lower, which will give it an ascending 
power and moisten a portion of the stem. After the instrument is 
allowed to take a state of rest, it should be raised about an inch, 
again allowed to sink, and if it takes the position it first occupied 
the reading should be made.

34 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

According to Archimedes' Theorem if a solid body is immersed in a 
liquid specifically heavier than itself, it will continue to sink until a 
bulk of fluid equal to its own weight is displaced. It is, therefore, 
necessary to have two kinds of hydrometers, one for fluids lighter 
than water and the other for fluids heavier than water. 

For fluids lighter than water, the hydrometer is sunk into water 
until the upper bulb is immersed and this point is marked 1. The 
scale is then formed by sinking the instrument into known fluids 
lighter than water and the points to which it sinks marked. 

For fluids heavier than water, the instrument is sunk into water 
until only about one inch remains unsubmerged and this point is 
marked 1. Then it is plunged into liquids heavier that water, the 
specific gravity of which are known, and the points to which it rises 
are marked, and scales made between the higher and lower marks 
indicating the specific gravities from 1 upward. 

Alcoholometers. Are hydrometers generally provided with two 
scales; Richter's, showing the percentage of alcohol by weight, and 
Tralles', indicating the percentage by volume at 15.6 C. 

Barkometers. Indicate specific gravities from 1.000 to 1.070 and 
are used to determine the density of tanning liquors. 

Baume Instrument. Has the zero of the scale fixed at a point 
marked by the surface of distilled water at 15 C. and the point at 
which it sinks in monohydrated sulphuric acid at the same tempera- 
ture is marked 66, corresponding to a specific gravity of 1.8427. 

The degrees on the scale, for liquids heavier than water, may be 
calculated to specific gravities by the following formula: 

15.56 145 

Specific Gravity - --- C.

Baum6 hydrometers may be obtained indicating specific gravities 
as well as scale readings. They are generally furnished in sets of six 
or eight, for heavy liquids, representing specific gravities from 1.000 to 
2.000, and in sets of the same number for light liquids, representing 
specific gravities from 0.700 to 1.000. 

Brix and Balling Saccharometers. Are practically the same; the 
number of degrees being identical with the percentage of sugar, by 
weight, in the solution. 

Carrier's Hydrometer. 22 corresponds with 22 Baume, but 
above and below this point the degrees are diminished in the ratio of 
16 to 15. 

Lovi's Beads or Specific Gravity Balls. Are glass beads, or balls, 
of various weights and are marked indicating the specific gravity of 
the liquid in which they will float or rest indifferently. 

Morse's Rendimento. Is a special hydrometer, with thermometer 
combined, for determining the possible yield of sugar from the cane 
by the density of the raw juice. A similar instrument is manufactured 
for determining the percentage of sugar in the beet from the specific 
gravity of the beet juice. The scale graduation is based upon actual 
results obtained by testing thousands of beet juice samples. 

Syke's Hydrometer. Is used by the Excise Officers in England to 
determine the strength of spirituous liquors. This is a brass instrument 
with stem graduated to 10 and supplied with a series of nine weights 
to place beneath the bulb. The temperature is observed and the 
weight put on. The point to which it sinks is noted on the stem, and 
from tables furnished with the instrument the strength of the spirit 
is ascertained. 

TwaddelFs Hydrometer. Is used in chemical works for testing the 
density of liquids heavier than water. The degrees indicated, multi- 
plied by 5 and added to 1000, denotes the specific gravity of the liquid 
compared with water. 

Quevenne's Lactometer. Is graduated for specific gravities from 
1.014 to 1.042. As the specific gravity of pure milk is 1.027 to 1.034, 
the specific gravity marked on the Quevenne instrument will probably 
cover all cases of adulterated milk as well as of pure milk. 

Urinometers. Have a specific gravity scale of 1.000 to 1.050. As 
the specific gravity of normal urine is generally from 1.017 to 1.020, 
the above scale is sufficient.

36 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Other special hydrometers of more or less usefulness are manu- 
factured for the determination of acetic acid and solids in vinegar; 
for the determination of the specific gravities of wines, and all kinds of 
semi-solids; of oils, cider, benzine, battery fluids, ether, gasoline, 
ammonia and many other liquids. 

The Westphal Balance. Which is a modification of the Mohr 
balance, is made especially for the determination of specific gravities. 
The improved instrument is provided with a thermometer plummet. 
The plummet is suspended from one end of the beam and the other 
end of the beam is provided with an adjustable weight whereby it is 
brought to equilibrium in the air. The plummet is then immersed 
in the solution to be tested this having been brought to the proper 
temperature and weights are put on until the equilibrium of the beam 
is restored. The largest weight indicates 1.000, the next 0.100, the 
next 0.010, the next 0.001, and the smallest 0.0001; thus the specific 
gravity can be read directly to the fourth decimal place. 

In the original form of the Westphal balance the plummet was 
first accurately weighed in air; next weighed in distilled water; then 
it was weighed in the fluid of which the specific gravity was desired. 
By dividing the loss of weight in the fluid by the loss of weight in 
water, the specific gravity of the fluid was obtained. 

Specific Gravity, or Density, of Solids. 

In determining the density of a solid it is necessary to find its mass, 
and also the mass of an equal volume of water. A number of methods 
have been proposed, a few of which are as follows: 

According to Les Industries 1 an apparatus for the determination 
of the specific gravity of solids has been invented which is described 
as follows: A burette, held by a clamp, is connected by means of a 
stout rubber tube with a bottle provided with a stopper and overflow 
funnel. The capacity of the bottle is exactly known. Supposing the 
substance whose specific gravity is to be determined is insoluble in 
water. In this case water is used as the liquid in the burette. In 
other cases some other liquid having no solvent action on the substance 
is used; the specific gravity of the latter being taken into account in 
the calculation. 

The first step is to ascertain the volume capacity of the bottle with 
connections. Water is allowed to flow from the burette (which must 
be large enough), through the stopcock and tube, into the bottle until 
it stands at a certain height. The burette is then so adjusted that the 
levels of the liquid in it and in the bottle are absolutely the same. 

1 Am. Drug., 1891, 20, 219. 



SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 



37 



Next the burette is lowered, the stopper of the bottle removed, and 
the solid substance introduced. When the water has completely 
enveloped, or permeated, it as the case may be the burette is 
raised again until the level of the liquid contained in it is again identical 
with that in the bottle. The difference between the first and second 
readings on the scale represents the volume of water in cc. which has 
been displaced by the substance. If the latter has previously been 
weighed in air, in grams, it is only necessary to divide by the number of 
cc. of water displaced in order to find the specific gravity. For ac- 
curate determinations, the temperature and pressure must be taken 
into consideration. 

LeChatelier's Apparatus. Is similar to Schumann's, but has a 
bulb blown into the neck. Richard K. Meade 1 has improved this 
specific gravity bottle by having the bulb made pear shape. 



To Determine the Specific Gravity of Powdered Substances. 

Schumann's (Dr. C.) Apparatus. 2 A * broad, flat-bottomed, glass 
vessel bears, ground into its neck, a graduated tube of a capacity of 
40 cc. divided into 1/10 cc. For use, the appa- 
ratus is filled to the zero mark with a liquid in- 
different toward the substance to be examined 
(water, oil of turpentine, etc.). A weighed por- 
tion of the substance is then gradually added 
through a wide-mouthed funnel, the quantity 
used varying between 60 and 200 grams, ac- 
cording to its bulkiness. The tube is then 
closed with a cork and allowed to stand until 
the surface layer of liquid is clear enough to 
read off its position by the lower meniscus. The 
specific gravity of the substance is found in the 
usual manner by dividing the number of grams 
of the substance used by the number of cc. which 
the liquid has risen in the tube. In order to 
avoid errors arising from differences of tempera- 
ture, it is only necessary to allow both the sub- 
stance and the liquid, previous to the experi- 
ment, to acquire the temperature of the room, 
and to take care that this same temperature be 
maintained throughout the experiment. 

The Westphal Balance. May be used to de-

termine the specific gravity of solids. In case the substance is 
heavier than, and insoluble in water, the substance is first weighed in 
air and then in distilled water at standard temperature. The weight 
in water is deducted from the weight in air, and the weight in air 
divided by the difference obtained, which gives the specific gravity of 
the substance. 

EXAMPLE. 

A solid weighs in air 17 grams. 

Immersed in water 14.25 grams. 

Difference in weight 2.75 grams. 

17 divided by 2.75 = 6.1818 +. 

In case of a solid insoluble in but lighter than water: First weigh 
the solid in air, and then attach a sinker of lead and weigh in distilled 
water, thereby obtaining the combined weight. Detach the light 
solid and weigh the sinker alone in the water. Deduct the weight of 
both in water from the weight of the sinker in water; add the weight 
of the light solid in air, and divide the weight of the light substance in 
air by the product so obtained. 

EXAMPLE. 

A light substance weighs in air 14 grams; attached to a lead sinker, the combined 
weight in water is 5 grams, and the lead alone in water weighs 6 grams. 

Weight of sinker in water 6 grams. 

Weight of both in water 5 grams. 

Difference 1 gram. 

Weight of light solid in air 14 grams. 

Total 15 grams. 

Then 14 divided by 15 equals 0.933, the specific gravity of the light substance. 

To determine the specific gravity of a powder which is insoluble in 
and heavier than water: Weigh the substance in air. Transfer to a 
specific gravity bottle and fill same with distilled water, and weigh 
the whole. From the weight of the powder in air, plus the weight of 
water which the specific gravity bottle will hold, deduct the combined 
weight of the substance and water, and divide by the original weight 
of the substance. 

EXAMPLE. 

The powder weighs 4 grams in air and specific gravity bottle holds 25 grams of 
water. The powder plus sufficient water to fill the bottle weighs 27.5 grams; then 

4 grams + 25 grams = 29 grams. 

Weight of bottle with powder and water = 27.5 grams. 

Difference 1.5 grams. 

Therefore 4 grams divided by 1.5 grams equals 2.66, equals the specific gravity 
of the powder. 






SPECIFIC GRAVITY. 39 

Other methods for the determination of the specific gravity of a 
powder which is insoluble in and heavier than water is to use Schu- 
mann's or LeChatelier's Apparatus. 

To obtain the specific gravity of a substance soluble in water: Use 
the last method given above but in place of water use oil of turpentine, 
which will do for most water soluble salts. Obtain the specific gravity 
the same as if water had been used and multiply the result by the 
specific gravity of the oil of turpentine, or the liquid in which the 
weighing was made. 

EXAMPLE. 

The substance weighed in air 9 grams and when weighed in oil of turpentine the 
weight was 3.75 grams; 

The weight of the substance in air 9. grams. 

The weight of the substance in oil of turpentine 3.75 grams. 

Difference 5.25 grams. 

Dividing 9 grams by 5.25 grams equals 1.714 + > equals the specific gravity if 
water had been used. Multiplying by 0.86, the specific gravity of turpentine equals 
1.47404, the specific gravity of the substance.

CHAPTER IV. 
GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 

Acid Value. Is expressed as the number of milligrams of potassium 
hydroxide neutralized by the free fatty acids in 1 gram of fat, oil or 
resin. It is determined by weighing five to ten grams of oil or fat in a 
tared flask and adding forty or fifty cc. of neutral alcohol. As alcohol 
is generally acid it should be carefully neutralized with decinormal 
potassium hydroxide before using. Mix thoroughly so as to obtain 
all the free fatty acids and titrate with potassium hydroxide, using 
phenolphthalein as indicator. In case of solid fats, heat on water 
bath to liquefy the fat and titrate while hot. 

The results may be reported as stearic, palmitic or oleic acid. As 
one cc. of decinormal potassium hydroxide is equal to 0.0284 stearic, 
0.0256 palmitic, and 0.0282 oleic acid, it is generally reported as simply 
the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide used. Calculations 
are made upon the basis that one cc. of decinormal potassium hydroxide 
contains 5.611 milligrams of pure potassium hydroxide. 

EXAMPLE. 

Used 7.2 mils decinormal potassium hydroxide to neutralize the acids from 3.235 
grams of palm oil. The acid value would be calculated as follows: 



7 2 V ^ 

A = = 12.45, or the acid value. 

3.235 

If reported as the percentage of palmitic acid the calculation would be as follows: 

7.2 X 0.0256 X 100 

A = - -- - =5.69 per cent. 
6.265 

In artificially colored fats the coloring should be removed before 
attempting to determine the acid value. This is done by shaking the 
oil with 80 per cent, alcohol, petroleum ether, or some suitable solvent 
for the coloring matter. In natural dark colored oils alkali blue 6B 
should be used in place of phenolphthalein, which turns red with al- 
kalies. The acid value of oils is not a constant value but depends 
upon the rancidity of the oil. 

Acetyl Value. 1 Is the number of milligrams of potassium hydroxide

required to neutralize the acetic acid obtained by the saponification 
of 1 gram of an acetylated oil, fat or wax. 

Holland 1 defined the acetyl number as the milligrams of potassium 
hydroxide required for the saponification of the acetyl assimilated 
by one gram of an oil, fat or wax on acetylation. 

Lewkowitsch 2 states that the method of determining the acetyl 
value is based on the principle that hydroxy acids, on being heated 
with acetic anhydride, exchange the hydrogen atom of their alcoholic 
hydroxyl group or groups for the radical of acetic acid according to 
the following equation, taking ricinoleic acid as example: 

CnH 32 (OH)COOH + (C 2 H 3 0) 2 = C 17 H 3 2(OC 2 H 3 O)COOH + C 2 H 4 2

Blown Oils. Many oils have the property of absorbing oxygen and 
thereby becoming thick. Special apparatus is used for preparing 
" blown" oils. Hurst 3 gives the following description for thickening 
oils by use of Veitch- Wilson's Apparatus. The pan is filled half full 
of oil, steam is then turned into the coil and the temperature of the 
oil raised to 71 or 76.5 C. The air sent through should be heated 
to the same temperature. The air is then blown in and the oil begins 
to oxidize and the temperature shows signs of rising. The steam is 
now regulated to maintain a constant temperature, and if necessary 
a current of cold water is used to hold the temperature. The opera- 
tion is completed in from eighteen to twenty-four hours according to the 
thickness of the oil desired. Lardine is prepared by this method from 
cottonseed oil and is used to mix with mineral oil for lubricant. In 
case of linseed oil the oxidization is continued until the oil becomes 
solid for linoleum making.

Boiling Point. The boiling point is defined as the range of tempera- 
ture within which at least 95 per cent, by volume of the substance 
distills when treated as follows: A distilling flask of 50 to 60 cc. capacity

is generally sufficient, connected with a straight glass water jacket 
condenser. The distilling flask is placed upon an asbestos board of 
12 to 15 cm. square, and from 3 to 5 mm. in thickness, having a circular 
perforation of about 2 cm. in diameter, and centrally located. An 
accurately standardized thermometer should be used, and if there is a 
stem exposure, an auxilliary thermometer should be used so as to make 
proper correction. The distillation should be at the rate of 1 cc. for 
each fifteen or twenty seconds, noting the temperature as soon as five 
drops of the liquid has distilled and also when 95 per cent, of the volume 
has distilled. Correction should be made for barometric pressure by 
allowing 0.1 C. for each 2.7 mm. difference from the standard pressure 
of 760 mm., adding if the pressure is lower and subtracting if it is 
higher.

Bromine Value. When bromine is allowed to act upon an oil it is 
absorbed with evolution of hydrobromic acid. The iodine value is 
now determined almost to the exclusion of the bromine value and will 
be considered in detail later.

CHOLESTEROL (C 27 H 4 5OH). PHYTOSTEROL AND 
SITOSTEROL. 

Cholesterol. Is found in small quantities in all animal oils and fats; 
therefore, cholesterol indicates animal origin. It occurs partly free 
and partly as an ester with higher fatty acids, in the bile, in the brain, 
blood, egg-yolk and in gall-stones, which contain 90 per cent, of 
cholesterol generally, and up to 40 or 50 per cent, in wool-fat. 

Hic^ter 1 claims that cholesterol protects the red blood corpuscles 
from haemolysis by certain toxins. It acts, therefore, against in- 
vading poisons. 

Cholesterol melts at 148 C., is insoluble in water, crystallizes from 
alcohol in mother-of-pearl leaflets. (O)D = 31.12 (in ether). 

Tschugaew's 2 Color Reaction for Cholesterol. Dissolve cholesterol 
in glacial acetic acid and add an excess of acetyl chloride together with a 
small piece of zinc chloride. On warming, a red or rose coloration 
is produced, which also shows a greenish-yellow fluorescence. The 
maximum depth of color is reached after boiling five minutes. 

Phytosterol. Is isomeric with cholesterol and is found in vegetable 
oils and fats, as it occurs in all seeds and fruits. 

Phytosterol crystals melt at 132 C. to 134 C. It crystallizes from 
chloroform, petroleum ether and ether in slender, glittering plates. 
It is le vorotatory : (a) D 34.2. 

Sitosterol. Is a monatomic alcohol, isomeric with cholesterol and 
phytosterol, and is found in maize oil 3 and oils produced from germs 
of the gramineae. 

Cholesterol and phytosterol are both determined by the same 
method and when only one is present the melting point of the acetate, 
together with the crystaline form will distinguish the origin, that is, 
if from vegetable (phytosterol) or animal (cholesterol) source. In 
mixtures, both forms of crystals will appear, with phytosterol crystals 
predominating even if the mixture contains a larger proportion of 
cholesterol. 

The Determination of Cholesterol and Phytosterol: The A.O.A.C. 4 
have given the alcoholic extraction method as well as the digitonin 
method for determining cholesterol and phytosterol as acetates, as 
follows : 

Alcohol Extraction Method : Introduce 200 to 300 grams of the melted fat into a 
flat-bottomed liter flask. Close the neck of the flask with a three-holed stopper and 
insert through these holes, (1) a reflux condenser, (2) a right-angled glass tube, 
one arm of which reaches to a point 6 mm. above the surface of the melted fat, the 
other being closed a short distance from the flask by means of a short piece of rubber

GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 57 

tubing and a pinch-cock; (3) a glass tube bent so that one arm reaches down to the 
bottom of the flask and the other serves as a delivery tube for a 700 cc. round-bot- 
tomed flask containing 500 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol by volume. 

Place the flasks containing the melted fat and the alcohol on a steam bath and 
heat so that the alcohol vapor passes through the melted fat in the liter flask and is 
condensed in the reflux condenser, finally collecting in a layer over the melted fat. 
After all the alcohol has passed in this manner into the flask containing the fat, dis- 
connect the flask from which the alcohol has been distilled and attach a tube to the 
short piece of rubber tubing attached to the right-angled glass tube (see (2) above) 
and siphon the alcohol layer back into the alcohol distillation flask. Reconnect as at 
first and again distill the alcohol as in the first operation. When all the alcohol has 
been distilled, siphon it again into the distillation flask and extract in the same manner 
for a third time. 

Discard the fat and retain the alcohol which now contains practically all of the 
cholesterol and phytosterol originally present in the fat. Concentrate the alcoholic 
solution to about 250 cc. and add 20 cc. of potassium hydroxid solution (1 to 1) to 
the boiling liquid. Boil for 10 minutes to insure complete saponification of the fat, 
cool to room temperature and pour into a large separatory funnel containing 500 cc. 
of warm ether. Shake to insure thorough mixing and add 500 cc. of water. Rotate 
the funnel gently to avoid the formation of extremely stubborn emulsions, but mix 
the water thoroughly with the alcohol-ether-soap solution. A clear, sharp separation 
takes place at once. Draw off the soap solution and wash the ether layer with 300 cc. 
of water, avoiding shaking. Repeat the washing of the ether solution with small 
quantities of water until all the soap is removed. Transfer the ether layer to a 
flask and distill the ether until the volume of liquid remaining in the flask measures 
about 25 cc. Transfer this residue to a tall 50 cc. beaker and continue the evapora- 
tion until all the ether is driven off and the residue is perfectly dry. If desired, a 
tared beaker may be used and the weight of the unsaponifiable matter determined 
at this point. 

Add 3-5 cc. of acetic anhydrid to the residue in the beaker, cover the beaker with 
a watch glass and heat to boiling over a free flame. After boiling for a few seconds, 
remove the beaker from the flame, cool and add 35 cc. of 60 per cent, alcohol by vol- 
ume. Mix the contents of the beaker thoroughly, filter off the alcoholic solution and 
wash the precipitate with 60 per cent, alcohol. Dissolve the precipitate on the filter 
with a stream of hot 80 per cent, alcohol by volume and wash the insoluble portion 
well with 80 per cent, alcohol. Acetates of cholesterol and phytosterol are dissolved, 
while the greater portion of the impurities present (including paraffin and paraffin 
oil if present) remain behind on the filter. Cool the combined filtrate and washings 
to a temperature of 10-12 C. and allow to stand at that temperature for 2-3 hours. 
During this time the acetates of cholesterol and phytosterol crystallize from the 
solution. Collect the crystals upon a filter, wash with cold 80 per cent, alcohol and 
then dissolve them in a minimum amount of hot absolute alcohol. Collect the 
alcoholic solution of the acetates in a small, glass evaporating dish, add 2 or 3 drops 
of water to the solution and heat if not perfectly clear. Allow the alcohol to evapor- 
ate spontaneously, the contents of the dish being stirred occasionally to mix the de- 
posit of crystals, which form upon the edges, with the main body of the liquid. As 
soon as a good deposit of crystals has formed, collect them upon a hardened filter, 
wash twice with cold 90 per cent, alcohol and dry by suction, drying finally at 100 C. 
for 30 minutes, and determine the melting point, using sulphuric acid in the outer 
beaker and glycerin in the inner tube. 

The melting point of the first crop of crystals usually gives definite information 
as to the presence or absence of phytosterol, but the conclusion indicated should be 



58 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

confirmed by recrystallizing the crystals from absolute alcohol and again determining 
the melting point. If the crystals are pure cholesterol acetate, the melting point 
of the second crop should agree closely with that of the first. If phytosterol acetate 
is present, however, a higher melting point will be noted, as phytosterol acetate is 
less soluble in alcohol than cholesterol acetate. The melting point of cholesterol 
acetate is 114 C., that of phytosterol acetate 125-137 C. 

Digitonin Method. Shake vigorously 50 grams of the oil or fat for 15 minutes 
in a separatory funnel with 20 cc. of a 1 per cent, solution of digitonin in 95 per cent, 
alcohol by volume. Allow the mixture to stand for a time until the emulsion separ- 
ates. The lower or fat layer should be quite clear while the alcohol layer contains 
a bulky, flocculent precipitate. Draw off as much as possible of the fat, avoiding 
any loss of precipitate. Add 100 cc. of ether to the alcohol layer and filter the mix- 
ture. Wash the precipitate with ether until free from fat; after drying in the air, 
transfer it to a tall 50 cc. beaker, add 2-3 cc. of acetic anhydrid and cover the beaker 
with a watch glass. Then boil slowly over a low flame for thirty minutes. After 
cooling, add 30-35 cc. of 60 per cent, alcohol by volume and mix the contents of the 
beaker thoroughly. Filter off the alcohol solution and wash the precipitate with 60 
per cent, alcohol, then dissolve it on the filter with a stream of 80 per cent, alcohol 
by volume from a wash bottle and set aside the filtrate in a cool place (10 C. or be- 
low). After the acetates have crystallized out of this solution filter them off, re- 
crystallize from absolute alcohol, dry and determine the melting point of each crop 
of crystals, as directed above. 

Congealing Point. Unless otherwise directed, about 10 cc. of the 
liquid to be tested Introduced into a dry test tube of from 18 to 20 
mm. internal diameter, which is then cooled in water or a suitable 
freezing mixture, the temperature of which should be about 5 lower 
than the supposed congealing point of the liquid. To induce crystal- 
lization, rub the walls of the tube with a standard thermometer or add 
a small crystal of the substance being tested. By alternated immersion 
of the tube in the bath, or removal from the bath and constant stirring 
with the thermometer, the temperature is so adjusted that the greater 
part of the liquid gradually congeals. The highest temperature re- 
maining constant for a short time during the congealing is defined as 
the congealing point. U.S. P. 

The congealing or solidifying point when applied to fatty acids is 
described as the liter test. 

Crude Fiber. Is that portion of vegetable substance that is in- 
soluble in sulphuric acid of 1.25 per cent, and, also, insoluble in sodium 
hydroxide of 1.25 per cent, strength. It is determined in the analysis 
of many substances as stock food, cacao products, wheat flour, coffee, 
spices, etc. The official method is as follows: 

REAGENTS. 

(a) 1.25% Sulphuric acid solution. Exact strength determined by titration. 
(6) 1.25% Sodium hydroxide solution. Exact strength determined by titration. 



GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 59 

DETERMINATION. 

Extract a quantity of the substance, representing about 2 grams of 
the dry material, with ordinary ether, or use the residue from the 
determination of the ether extract. To this residue, in a 500 cc. flask 
add 200 cc. of boiling 1.25 per cent, sulphuric acid; connect the flask 
with an inverted condenser, the tube of which passes only a short 
distance beyond the rubber stopper into the flask, or simply cover a 
tall, conical flask (which is well suited for this determination) with a 
watch glass or short stemmed funnel. Boil at once and continue the 
boiling gently for 30 minutes. A blast of air conducted into the flask 
will serve to reduce frothing of the liquid. Filter through linen and 
wash with boiling water until the washings are no longer acid ; rinse the 
substance back into the flask with 200 cc. of boiling 1.25 per cent, 
solution of sodium hydroxide, free or nearly free from sodium carbon- 
ate, boil at once, and continue boiling gently for 30 minutes as directed 
above for the treatment with acid, filter at once rapidly, and wash 
with boiling water until the washings are neutral. The last filtration 
may be performed upon a Gooch crucible, a linen filter, or a tared 
filter paper. If a linen filter is used, rinse the crude fiber, after washing 
is completed, into a flat-bottomed platinum dish by means of a jet of 
water; evaporate to dryness on a steam bath, dry to constant weight 
at 110 C., weigh, incinerate completely and weigh again. The loss 
of weight is considered to be crude fiber. If a tared filter paper is 
used, weigh in a weighing bottle. In any case, the crude fiber, after 
drying to constant weight at 110 C., must be incinerated and the 
amount of the ash deducted from the original weight.

Elaidin Test. When certain oils, more especially olive, are treated 
with nitrous acid a perfectly solid mass forms which is called elaidin. 
The test is applied as follows: 10 cc. of the oil is shaken frequently 
with a freshly prepared solution of 1 gram of mercury in 3 cc. of nitric 
acid; within two hours a perfectly solid mass of a pale straw color 
will be produced in case of pure olive oil. 

Many methods have been proposed in the application of this test. 
Archbutt's 1 article upon this subject should be consulted to obtain 
a full understanding of the work that has been done by different chem- 
ists in applying this test. 

The non-drying oils yield solid masses; the semi-drying oils give 
more or less liquid products. 

Hehner Number. Represents the percentage value of insoluble 
fatty acids in an oil, fat or wax. 

The Association of Official Agricultural Chemists Method 2 directs 
that the Hehner Number be determined from the solid mass remaining 
after the determinination of the soluble acids from 5 grams of the 
substance which has first been used for the determination of the 
saponification number. The official method is as follows. 

Allow the flask, containing the cake of insoluble, fatty acids and the paper through 
which the soluble fatty acids have been filtered, to drain and dry for 12 hours. Trans- 
fer the cake, together with as much of the fatty acids as can be removed from the 
filter paper, to a weighed, wide-mouthed flask. Then place the funnel containing 
the filter in the neck of the flask and wash the paper thoroughly with hot absolute 
alcohol. Remove the funnel, evaporate off the alcohol, dry for two hours at 100 
C., cool in desiccator and weigh. Again dry for two hours and weigh again. Calcu- 
late the percentage of insoluble fatty acids. 

Hydrogenized Oils. Hardened Oils or Solidified Oils are oils that 
have been subjected to the action of hydrogen in the presence of a 

1 J. Soc. Chem. Ind., 1886, 5, 303.

GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 61 

catalyzer. Finely-divided nickel is generally used as the catalyzer, 
although a number of metals nave been proposed, such as platinum, 
palladium, and finely powdered metallic oxides. 

Bomer, 1 states the solidifying process is carried on to any desired 
extent according to the consistency desired in the finished product. 
For example, peanut oil may be hydrogenized until it resembles tallow, 
or, if treated a shorter period, into a product which cannot be distin- 
guished from lard as regards its appearance, consistence, taste and 
odor. The process results in the conversion of the unsaturated fatty 
acids (oleic acid, etc.) of the oil into stearic acid. The reaction is 
represented as follows: 

Ci8H34O2 -f- H-2 = CisHseC^ 
Oleic acid. Stearic acid. 

Hydrogenated oils have a lower iodine value and higher melting and 
solidifying points; no change in the saponification value, but the 
refractive index is lowered. Hardened cottonseed oil does not re- 
spond to the Halphen test, while hardened sesame oil responds to 
the Baudouin reaction. Cholesterin and phytosterin are not at- 
tacked by the hydrogenation of oils. 

Hydrogenized oils are apt to be contaminated with nickel, especially 
those containing much free acid. Holde's 2 method of detecting nickel 
in hardened oil is as follows: To detect nickel, 5 to 10 grams of fat 
are warmed one-half hour on a water bath with an equal volume of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, shaking frequently; after filtering 
through a moistened filter, the filtrate is evaporated in a porcelain 
dish. The residue gives, when nickel is present, on touching with a 
drop of 1 per cent, alcoholic dimethylglyoxime solution, a red colora- 
tion, which becomes even more noticeable on adding some ammonium 
hydroxide. If the acid extract is colored it must first be boiled with 
animal charcoal and then filtered. 

Kerr 3 states in reference to the analysis of hydrogenated oils : 

"It must be assumed, then, that the problems of those unlucky chemists who are 
responsible for the detection of the adulteration of edible oils and fats are now to be 
increased and complicated by the addition to the list of possible adulterants of a 
long list of hydrogenated and partly hydrogenated fats. Aside from the evident fact 
that the would-be adulterator may now alter at will the iodine number, refractive 
index, and titer of any fat he may choose, the process of hydrogenation brings about 
other changes which are of far reaching importance. The Halphen test of cotton- 
seed oil disappears, the erucic acid of rape and mustard oils becomes bebenic acid,

the highly unsaturated acids of the fish oils are reduced to solid acids which no longer 
give the characteristic precipitate of insoluble bromides. It is to be seen at once 
that many of our tried and trusty tests will fail us completely before this new problem, 
and it is equally plain that we must devise new tests to meet the new condition or 
confess failure." 

An enormous quantity of hydrogenated cocoanut oil is being used in 
the manufacture of nut margarine and lard substitutes; the same is 
true of cottonseed oil and to a less extent, peanut oil. Hydrogenated 
oils have been recommended to be used in pharmacy as an ointment 
base. 1 They are also used in the manufacture of tinplate. 2

that this corresponds very closely with WijV iodine number. 

Iodine Value. The number of grams of iodine absorbed by 100 
grams of fat, oil or wax. 

There are three methods of determining the iodine value that have 
been used to a considerable extent. The U.S. P. VIII recognizes the 
Hiibl method, while the U.S. P. IX official method is the Hanus. 
The third method is Wijs's. The different methods will now be de- 
scribed at some length, as the iodine number of oils is a very im- 
portant constant. 

Hanus Method. In the. determination of the iodine value by the 
Hanus method it is necessary to have test solutions as follows : 

The lodo-Bromine Test Solution is prepared as follows: Dissolve 
13.2 grams of powdered iodine in 1000 cc. of glacial acetic acid with 
the aid of a gentle heat, if necessary to facilitate solution. Cool the 
solution to 25 C. and determine the iodine constant in 20 cc. of the 
solution by means of tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate V.S.; then 
add to the solution a quantity of bromine molecularly equivalent to 
that of the iodine present (3 cc. being the usual approximate amount). 
Keep the solution in glass stoppered bottles, protected from light. 
- U.S.P. 

The Method given by the Association of Official Agricultural 
Chemists 1 for preparing the iodo-bromine solution is as follows: 
Measure 825 cc. of acetic acid, which has shown no reduction by the 
dichromate test, and dissolve in it 13.615 grams of iodine with the 
aid of heat. Cool and titrate 25 cc. of this solution against the N/10 
sodium thiosulphate. Add 3 cc. of bromine to 200 cc. of acetic acid 
and titrate 5 cc. of the solution against the N/10 sodium thiosulphate. 
Calculate the quantity of bromine solution required exactly to double 
the halogen content of the remaining 800 cc. of iodine solution as 
follows : 



in which A = Cc. of bromine solution required; 

B 800 X the thiosulphate equivalent of 1 cc. of iodine 

solution ; 
C The thiosulphate equivalent of 1 cc. of bromine solution. 

EXAMPLE. 

13.615 grams of iodine are dissolved in 8250 cc. of acetic acid. 30 cc. of bromine 
are dissolved in 2000 cc. of acetic acid. Titrating 50 cc. of the iodine solution against

the standard thiosulphate shows that 1 cc. of the iodine solution equals 1.1 cc. of the 
thiosulphate (0.0165 gram of iodine). Titrating 5 cc. of the bromine solution shows 
that 1 cc. of the bromine solution equals 4.6 cc. of the thiosulphate. Then the 
quantity of bromine solution required to double the halogen content of the remaining

8200 cc. of iodine solution is equivalent to - " or 1961 cc. Upon mix- 
ing the two solutions in this proportion, a total volume of 10161 cc. is obtained, 
containing 135.3 grams of iodine. In order to reduce this solution to the prope^

1.2 grams of iodine present in excess, or = 91 cc. of acetic acid which

Starch Test Solution should be freshly prepared whenever required. 
It is prepared by triturating 1 gram of starch with 10 cc. of cold dis- 
tilled water and then adding sufficient boiling distilled water to make 
200 cc. 

Potassium Iodide Test Solution is prepared by dissolving 20 grams 
of potassium iodide in 100 cc. of distilled water. 

Tenth-Normal Potassium Dichromate Volumetric Solution is pre- 
pared by dissolving 4.9033 grams of purified potassium dichromate 
in sufficient distilled water to make 1000 cc. This solution should be 
checked against iron. 

Decinormal Sodium Thiosulphate Volumetric Solution is prepared 
by dissolving 30 grams of sodium thiosulphate in 1000 cc. of distilled 
water, and standardized as follows: To 25 cc. of the decinormal dichro- 
mate solution add about 2 grams of potassium iodide and 10 cc. of 
dilute sulphuric acid. Add 200 cc. of distilled water and let stand in 
a glass-stoppered flask in a dark place for 30 minutes. Titrate with 
the sodium thiosulphate solution until a yellowish-green color appears, 
then add a small amount of the starch solution; continue the titration 
until the blue color of the mixture changes to light green. Note the 
number of cc. of the thiosulphate solution consumed. Dilute the 
sodium thiosulphate solution with distilled water so that equal volumes 
of it and tenth-normal potassium dichromate solution will exactly 
correspond to each other. 

Determination According to the U.S.P. Introduce about 0.8 Gm. of a solid 
fat or about 0.3 Gm. 1 of an oil, accurately weighed, into a glass stoppered bottle 
of 250 mil capacity, dissolve it in 10 mils of chloroform, add 25 mils of iodo-bro- 
mide T.S., accurately measured from a burette or pipette, stopper the bottle 
securely, and allow the mixture to stand for half an hour 2 in a cool place pro- 
tected from light. After this time it must still retain a brown color; if the color 
is not brown a new test should be started, using a smaller quantity of the fat or 
oil. Then add in order named, 30 cc. of potassium iodide T.S. 100 cc. of distilled 

1 Q.l5 to 0.18 Gm. for linseed oil, 0.18 to 0.2 Gm. for cod liver oil, and 0.8 to 
0.1 Gm. for oil of theobroma. 

2 One hour is required for castor oil and linseed oil.

water, and tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate V.S. in small successive portions, 
shaking thoroughly after each addition, until the color of the mixture becomes 
quite pale. Add a few drops of starch T.S. and continue the addition of tenth- 
normal sodium thiosulphate V.S. until the blue color is discharged. While this 
test is being carried out, make a blank test by mixing exactly the same quantities 
of iodo-bromide T.S. and chloroform and titrating the free iodine with tenth-normal 
sodium thiosulphate VS. as directed above. The difference in the number of cc. of 
tenth-normal sodium thiosulphate V.S. consumed by the blank test and the actual 
test, multiplied by 1.269 and divided by the weight of the fat or oil taken, gives the 
iodine value. 

Hubl Method. In the determination of the iodine value by the 
Hubl method it is necessary 'to have two solutions as follows: 

Iodine Test Solution, Alcoholic: Dissolve 25 grams of iodine in 
500 cc. of alcohol. 

Mercuric Chloride Test Solution, Alcoholic: Dissolve 30 grams of 
mercuric chloride in 500 cc. of alcohol. 

The determination of the iodine number is the same as in the Hanus 
method, except that 25 cc. of an equal mixture of the above solutions 
are used in place of the iodo-bromide solution and the mixture is 
set aside for four hours, (in case of linseed oil 16 hours) and the titra- 
tion is carried on in the usual manner. The iodine solution and 
mercuric chloride solution should be kept in separate bottles and 
mixed 12 hours before using. 

Wijs Method. Is essentially the same as the Hanus, except that 
chlorine is used in place of bromine in the acetic iodine solution. 

The Hanus method has the advantage over the 
Hubl in that the iodo-bromide solution is more 
stable and it takes less time to complete the opera- 
tion; while in Wijs method the preparation of 
the iodo-chloride solution is more troublesome. 

In the determination of the iodine number any 
glass-stoppered bottle may be used, but the so- 
called " Iodine Bottle," or flask, is very conven- 
ient, as the oil can be dropped directly in the tared 
bottle or flask and weighed. 

The best form of iodine bottle is a light-weight, 
glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask of about 300 cc. F 12 j oc j me 
capacity. Solid or semi-solid fats should be weighed Bottle, 

upon a very small tared watch crystal, which, 
together with the fat, is placed in the flask, there being no loss by 
transferring the sample to the flask. 

Drying oils have an iodine value of 130 to 200; semi-drying oils 
from 95 to 130 and non-drying oils below 95. The determination of 
the iodine value indicates the class to which the oil belongs.

Maumene Number. This thermal test is applied as follows: a 200 
cc. beaker is packed into a larger beaker, with cotton filling the space 
between the two. Fifty grams of oil are weighed into the inner 
beaker, a thermometer is immersed in the oil and the temperature 
accurately read. Ten cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid are added; 
the mixture is stirred, and the maximum temperature observed. The 
difference between the initial and final temperature, expressed in 
degrees Centigrade, is considered the Maumene number. 

Oils having a high iodine value give more heat on treatment with 
sulphuric acid and this test has been used as a substitute for the iodine 
value, owing to its being rapid and convenient to apply. At present 
the test is not used to any great extent. 

Marden and Dover 1 propose to determine the amount of heat 
generated in this test with a calorimeter and express the results in 
terms of calories per gram of oil.

Melting Point. MullikenV method for determining melting points 
is very convenient for practical purposes. The apparatus required 
is a round-bottomed flask with a bulb 65 mm. in diameter, and a 
neck 75 mm. in length and 20 mm. in diameter, and having a capacity 
of 200 cc.; an inner tube or a test tube with a diameter of 15 mm. which 
hangs freely suspended by its flanged lip. Both the inner tube and the 
flask are filled nearly to the neck of the flask with a clear liquid. It 
is advisable to have two baths. One for temperatures between and 
200 C. and the other from 220 to 320 C. For the former colorless 
sulphuric acid of 1.84 specific gravity is recommended and for the 
latter boil together a mixture of 70 parts by weight of concentrated 
sulphuric acid and 30 parts of neutral potassium sulphate, stirring 
constantly until the sulphate is completely dissolved. Fixed oils, 
such as cottonseed, may also be used for a bath. A few milligrams of 
the substance is placed in a thin-walled capillary, closed at the lower 
end. Melting point tubes should be 6 or 7 centimeters in length and 
have an internal diameter of 1 mm. The charged capillary is attached 
to a thermometer by a piece of rubber tubing or fine platinum wire so 
that the substance in the capillary is situated opposite the middle of 
the thermometer bulb. The thermometer and capillary tube are 
suspended in the inner tube with the thermometer bulb reaching nearly 
to the bottom of same. The bath should be heated with a Bunsen 
flame until a temperature is reached about 25 C. below the melting 
point of the substance. As the melting point is approached an average 
rise of 2 per minute for the last few minutes is fast enough. The 
melting point is read the moment when the first clear drop of sufficient 
size to detach itself from the solid mass rolls down the capillary under 
the influence of gravity.

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



The majority of melting points, as given in standard works, are not 
corrected for stem-exposure. For determining the melting points 
with corrections for stem-exposure, the U.S. P. method should be used. 
The correction for stem-exposure may be made by the use of an em- 
pirical table given by Mulliken 1 as follows:

Melting Point of Fats and Fatty Acids. Wiley's method is the offi- 
cial method of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists and 
is as follows: 

REAGENT. 

Alcohol- Water Mixture. Specific gravity same as that of the fat to be examined. 
Prepare by boiling, separately, water and 95 per cent, alcohol by volume for 10 
minutes to remove the gases which may be held in solution. While still hot pour the 
water into a test tube until it is almost half full. Nearly fill the test tube with hot 
alcohol, poured down the side of the inclined tube to avoid too much mixing. If 
the alcohol be added after the water has cooled, the mixture will contain so many air 
bubbles as to be unfit for use. 

DETERMINATION. 

Prepare disks of fat as follows: Allow the melted and filtered fat to fall a distance 
of 15 to 20 centimeters from a dropping tube upon a piece of ice or upon the surface of 
cold mercury. The disks thus formed should be 1 to 1.5 cm. in diameter and weigh 
about 200 mg. When solid remove the disk and allow to stand 2 to 3 hours in order 
to obtain the normal melting point. 

Place a test tube, 30 by 3.5 cm., containing the alcohol-water mixture, in a tall 
beaker, 35 by 10 cm., containing ice water, until cold. Drop a disk of the fat into 
the tube and it will at once sink to a point where the density of the alcohol-water 
mixture is exactly equivalent to its own. Lower an accurate thermometer, which 
can be read to 0.1 C., into the test tube until the bulb is just above the disk. In 

1 Identification of Pure Organic Compounds, 1, 218. 






GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 69 

order to secure an even temperature in all parts of the alcohol-water mixture around 
the disk, stir gently with the thermometer. Slowly heat the water in the beaker, 
constantly stirring it by means of an air blast or other suitable device. 

When the temperature of the alcohol-water mixture rises to about 6 C. below the 
melting point of the fat, the disk of fat begins to shrivel and gradually rolls up into an 
irregular mass. Lower the thermometer until the fat particle is even with the center 
of the bulb. Rotate the thermometer bulb gently and regulate the temperature so 
that about 10 minutes for the increment of the last 2 degrees are required. As soon 
as the mass becomes spherical, read the thermometer. Remove the tube from the 
bath and again cool. Place in the bath a second tube containing the alcohol-water 
mixture. The test tube is of sufficiently low temperature to cool the bath to the 
desired point, ice water having been used for cooling. After the first or preliminary 
determination, regulate the temperature of the bath so as to reach a maximum of 
about 1.5 C. above the melting point of the fat under examination. 

Do not allow the edge of the disk to touch the sides of the tube. If it does so, 
make a new determination. Run triplicate determinations of which the second and 
third results should agree closely.

Nitrogen Determination. There have been proposed several meth- 
ods for the determination of nitrogen by moist combustion. With 
slight modification, the Gunning method will illustrate all. The 
organic matter is first decomposed with sulphuric acid in the presence 
of an oxidizer; the carbon and hydrogen being driven off as carbon di- 
oxide and water. The nitrogen is converted into an ammonium salt 
and the ammonia is finally liberated by a fixed alkali. The free 
ammonia (NH 3 ) is then distilled into an acid solution of known 
normality. 

This method should be used for organic and ammoniacal nitrogen, 
only, and not when nitrates are present. 



70 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The Gunning Method for the determination of nitrogen is as follows : 
Place 0.7 to 3.5 grams, according to nitrogen content, of the substance 
to be analyzed into a 550 cc. Kjeldahl flask (used for both digestion 
and distillation). Add 10 grams of powdered potassium sulphate and 
20 cc. concentrated sulphuric acid. Place the flask in an inclined posi- 
tion on an asbestos support (with a circular opening so that the flame 
will strike directly on the flask). Heat below the boiling point for 
about fifteen minutes, or until frothing has ceased. A small piece of 
paraffin may be added to prevent foaming. Then raise the tempera- 
ture to boiling and digest until the mixture is colorless, or until oxida- 
tion is complete. Cool and add 300 cc. of distilled water and then a 
strong solution of sodium hydroxide until strongly alkaline. Use 
phenolphthalein as indicator. The pink color, indicating an alkaline 
reaction, is destroyed by a considerable excess of strong fixed alkali, 
The flask is connected with a condenser by using a Kjeldahl connecting 
bulb. The adapter to the condenser should dip into the acid solution 
in the receiving flask. Place in a receiving flask, 25 cc. of decinormal 
sulphuric or hydrochloric acid and add a few drops of cochineal or 
methyl red solution as indicator. Add a few pieces of granulated 
zinc to the distilling flask to prevent bumping, and two or three grams 
of paraffin (if it was not used in digesting and boiling the sample) to 
prevent foaming. The first 150 to 200 cc. of the distillate will con- 
tain all the ammonia. If cochineal has been used as indicator, and 
the distillate turns the decinormal acid solution violet, there should be 
added a sufficient quantity of decinormal acid to make the distillate 
permanently yellowish-red ; and in case methyl red is used as indicator 
and the distillate should turn yellow, then decinormal acid should 
be added in sufficient quantity to produce a rose-red color. Titrate 
the distillate with decinormal sodium hydroxide. Deduct the number 
of cc. of decinormal alkali used from the number of cc. of decinormal 
acid added and the difference will be the number of cc. of decinormal 
acid neutralized by the ammonia. One cc. decinormal acid = 
0.001401 nitrogen. The percentage of nitrogen would be calculated 
from the formula as follows : 

N = (.001401 X cc. N/W acid neutralized) 100 
Weight of sample in grams. 

Reagents for the Determination of Nitrogen : 

(a) Cochineal or Methyl Red Solution as indicator. The cochineal 
solution is prepared by digesting 3 grams powdered cochineal in a 
mixture of 50 cc. of alcohol and 200 cc. of water for a day or two, 
at ordinary temperature, and then filtering. Methyl Red Solution is 



GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 71 

prepared by dissolving 1 gram of methyl red in 100 cc. of 95 per cent, 
alcohol. 

(6) Decinormal hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. 

(c) Decinormal sodium or potassium hydroxide. 

(d) Granulated zinc, to prevent bumping. 

(e) Paraffin, to prevent foaming. 

(/) Potassium Sulphate, which is employed as a catalytic agent for 
raising the boiling point of sulphuric acid the potassium sulphate 
being converted into the bisulphate when boiled with the sulphuric 
acid solution. 

(g) Sodium hydroxide, a saturated solution. Free from nitrates. 

(h) Sulphuric acid, Sp. Gr. 1.84 free from nitrates and am- 
monium sulphate. 

Modifications of Gunning Method to include nitrogen in nitrates. 

The reagents and standard solutions are the same as in the regular 
Gunning method with the addition of pure sodium thiosulphate and 
salicylic acid. The determination is made by using the usual amount 
of the sample and adding 30-35 cc. of salicylic acid mixture (30 cc. of 
sulphuric acid to 1 gram of salicylic acid). Mix thoroughly and 
shake the mixture frequently for one-half hour. Add 5 grams of 
sodium thiosulphate and heat the mixture for five minutes; cool and 
add 10 grams of potassium sulphate and heat gently until foaming 
ceases; then strongly until nearly colorless. Complete the deter- 
mination as given under the Gunning method.

Saponification. The saponification of oils, fats and waxes is ac- 
complished in several different ways : (a) By heating with water under 
pressure of 8 to 12 atmospheres, or distilling with superheated steam. 
This method is used commercially in the saponification of fats and oils 
in the manufacture of soap and candles. Fats are largely composed 
of triglycerides of the fatty acids stearic, palmitic and oleic. When 
the fat is decomposed by superheated steam it takes up water and is 
said to be hydrolized free fatty acids and glycerin being formed. 
Glycerin is a trihydric alcohol C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 and its manufacture from 
glyceryl stearate may be represented by the following formula: 

C 3 H5(Ci 8 H350 2 )3 + 3H 2 = 3HCi 8 H 3 50 2 + C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 . 
Glyceryl stearate Water Stearic acid Glycerin 



74 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

(6) By heating to 110 C. with about 8 per cent, concentrated sul- 
phuric acid. The exact rationale of this change is not understood. 

(c) By heating with basic hydroxides. This is the method of 
saponification used in pharmaceutical and food analysis. 

In all cases a soap is produced and those produced by the alkalies 
are soluble in water while most other soaps are insoluble. 

Whenever an oil or fat is saponified there will be produced fatty 
acids and glycerol, while waxes similarly treated yield fatty acids and 
a monotomic alcohol instead of glycerol. 

Potassium hydroxide is preferable as the saponifying agent as the 
potash soaps are more soluble than soda soaps; hence the saponification 
is more rapid owing to the intimate contact of the reacting substances. 
The following reaction illustrates the process when glyceryl oleate is 
acted upon by potassium hydroxide: 

(CnHgsCC^sCgHs + 3KOH = C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 + 3Ci 7 H 3 3CO 2 K. 
Glyceryl oleate Glycerin Potassium oleate (soap) 

Saponification Value. Is called saponification number, saponifica- 
tion coefficient and Koettstorfer's Number. It is the number of 
milligrams of potassium hydroxide required to saponify one gram of 
fat, wax or oil. 

The saponification of fats and oils with alcoholic potassium hydroxide 
was proposed by Koettstorfer 1 in 1878 and his method is the official 
method at the present time, with very little modification. The U.S. P. 
IX and the method of the A.O.A.C. 2 are the same, except that the 
A.O.A.C. directs that about 5 grams of the sample be used and 50 cc. 
of the alcoholic potassium hydroxide, while the U.S. P. method directs 
that about one-half that amount of the sample be used and one-half 
the amount of the alkali solution. 

Determination of the Saponification Value. 
REAGENTS. 

1. Half-normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide: Volumetric Solution: 
This solution should be prepared by dissolving about 35 grams of 
potassium hydroxide in 20 cc. distilled water and adding it to a suffi- 
cient quantity of purified alcohol to make 1000 cc. The solution, 
after standing 24 hours, is decanted and standardized with half- 
normal hydrochloric acid. 

2. Purified Alcohol. The Purified alcohol is prepared by dissolving 
2 or 3 grams of silver nitrate in 5 cc. of distilled water and adding the 

1 Analyst, 1879, 4, 106-111. 

2 Methods of Analysis, 1916, 306. 



GENERAL METHODS OF ANALYSIS. 75 

solution to 1200 cc. of alcohol. Dissolve 5 grams of potassium 
hydroxide in 25 cc. of warm alcohol, cool and pour it slowly, without 
stirring, into the alcoholic solution of silver nitrate. Let the mixture 
stand until the precipitated silver oxide settles; filter and distill. 

3. Half -Normal Hydrochloric Acid. The Pharmacopoeia directs 
that half-normal hydrochloric acid be prepared by adding sufficient 
quantity of distilled water to 500 cc. of normal hydrochloric acid to 
make exactly 1000 cc. The directions for making the normal hydro- 
chloric acid are as follows: 

Mix 110 cc. of hydrochloric acid with sufficient distilled water to measure 1000 cc. 
Of this liquid (which is still too concentrated) carefully measure, at standard tem- 
perature from a burette, 25 cc. into a flask or porcelain dish, and after diluting with 
about double its volume of distilled water, add 2 drops of methyl orange T.S., then 
gradually add from a burette a freshly standardized normal potassium hydroxide 
V.S., at the same temperature, until the red or pink tint of the solution changes, 
after continuous shaking or stirring, to a permanent pale yellow. Note the number 
of cc. of potassium hydroxide V.S. consumed, and then dilute the acid solution so 
that equal volumes of this and of the normal potassium hydroxide V.S. neutralize 
each other at 25 C. 

DETERMINATION. 

The saponification value is determined by weighing accurately, in an Erlenmeyer 
flask of 200 to 250 cc. capacity, 1.5 to 2 grams of the sample. Add 25 cc. of half- 
normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide and insert a small funnel in the neck of the 
flask, or connect it with a reflux condenser, and heat the flask on a water bath for 
one-half hour, frequently imparting a rotatory motion to the contents. Titrate the 
excess of alkali with half-normal hydrochloric acid, using phenolphthalein as in- 
dicator. Run a blank at the same time, using 25 cc. of the half-normal alcoholic 
potassium hydroxide solution. The difference in the number of cc. of half-normal 
hydrochloric acid consumed in the actual test and the blank, multiplied by 28.055 
and divided by the weight of the fat or oil taken, gives the saponification value. 

Half-normal hydrochloric acid should always be used to titrate in 
the determination of the saponification value as sulphuric acid would 
form a precipitate of potassium sulphate in alcoholic solution which 
would diminish the delicacy of the reaction. 

Alcoholic potassium hydroxide, when heated with excess of air, re- 
quires from 1/10 to 1/2 cc. less half-normal hydrochloric acid to 
neutralize each 25 cc., owing to the oxidation of the alcohol. There- 
fore, the blank should always be heated the same length of time as the 
sample being tested. 

Saponification Equivalent, or " Saturated Equivalent, " denotes the 
number of grams of oil, fat or wax saponified by one equivalent, that is, 
56.1 grams of potassium hydroxide, and may be calculated from the 
saponification value by dividing by 56100. The saponification value 
may be obtained by dividing 56100 by the saponification equivalent.

liter Test is the solidifying point of fatty acids and is determined 
by the method of the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists 1 
as follows : 

Saponify 75 grams of the sample in a metal dish with 60 cc. of 30 per cent, sodium 
hydroxide solution (36 Baume) and 75 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol by volume or 120 
cc. of water. Evaporate to dryness over a very low flame or on an iron or asbestos 
plate, stirring constantly. Dissolve the dry soap in one liter of boiling water and, 
if alcohol has been used, boil for 40 minutes to remove it, adding sufficient water to 
replace the loss in boiling. Liberate the fatty acids by adding 100 cc. of 30 per cent, 
sulphuric acid (25 Baume) and boil until they form a clear, transparent layer. Wash 
with boiling water until free from sulphuric acid, collect in a small beaker and place 
on a steam bath until the water has settled and the fatty acids are clear; then decant 
into a dry beaker, filter while hot and dry 20 minutes at 100 C. When dry, cool 
the fatty acids to 15 to 20 C. above the expected titer and transfer to a titer tube 
25 by 100 mm. (1 by 4 inches) made of glass about 1 mm. in thickness. Place in a 
16-ounce, wide-mouthed bottle of clear glass, 70 by 1500 mm. (2.8 by 6 inches), 
fitted with a perforated cork so as to hold the tube rigidly when in position. Suspend 
the standard thermometer so that it can be used as a stirrer and stir the mass slowly 
until the mercury remains stationary for 30 seconds. Then allow the thermometer 
to hang quietly, with the bulb in the center of the mass, and observe the rise of the 
mercury column. The highest point to which it rises is regarded as the titer of the 
fatty acids. 

Test the fatty acids for complete Saponification as follows: Place 3 cc. in a test 
tube and add 15 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol by volume. Bring the mixture to a boil 
and add an equal volume of ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.96). A clear solution 
should result. The titer must be made at about 20 C. for all fats having a titer 
above 30 C.; and at 10 C. below the titer for all other fats.

Unsaponifiable Matter 1 is the non-fatty acid constituents of fats 
and fatty oils, soluble in petroleum ether (B.P. 35-50 C.). 

When oils, fats and waxes are saponified there remains a small 
residue which may consist of cholesterol and phytosterol, non-fatty 
acid constituents or it may contain unsaponifiable adulterations. 
The following method of determination will be found satisfactory: 
Three grams of the sample is saponified with 25 cc. alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide solution by boiling for one hour under a reflux condenser. 
Transfer to a 100 cc. cylinder and make up to 50 cc. with cold water. 
Add 30 cc. redistilled petroleum ether with a boiling point from 35 
to 50 C. Draw off the petroleum ether layer with a siphon and 
repeat the extraction with five separate portions of the petroleum 
ether. Place the petroleum ether extracts in a Squibb separatory 
funnel and wash three times with 20 cc. of 50 per cent, alcohol. Trans- 
fer the contents of the funnel to a tared flask and evaporate to dryness 
on a water bath. Dry the residue in a water bath to constant weight. 

Owing to the volatility of many hydrocarbon oils at 100 C., the 
drying should not be carried any further than necessary. There 
is no danger of loss at 100 C. in case of rosin oil, many mineral oils 
and paraffin wax. In case large quantities of unsaponifiable matter 
is present it will be indicated when water is added to the alcoholic 
soap solution.

Valenta Acetic Acid Test, or turbidity temperature of oils and fats 
with glacial acetic acid.

ever, it is of interest as it is frequently referred to in works on oils and 
fats. ,

78 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Chattaway, Pearmain and Moor 1 enumerate the precautions to be 
observed in applying this test so as to obtain concordant results : 

(1). Strength of acetic acid. 

(2). Presence of water in the oil or fat under examination. 

(3). The temperature to which the oil or fat has been previously heated. 

(4). The method of stirring and observing the turbidity point. 

1. The acid used should contain 99.50 per cent, of acetic acid. 

2. The fat or oil must be free from moisture. 

3. Determinations unreliable if the oil or fat has been unduly heated. 

4. Test for turbidity should be applied as follows: Use a short and somewhat 
thick test tube of about 4" x%" with ground glass stopper. Weigh into tube 2.75 
grams of the sample and then add 3 cc. of acetic acid. The tube is then stoppered 
and placed into a beaker of warm water and the heat is increased until, after shaking 
the tube, the contents become clear. The source of heat is then removed and the 
test tube placed in the center of the beaker of heated water. A thermometer is 
attached to the test tube by means of a rubber band, and the whole is allowed to 
stand until the oil changes from brilliancy to turbidity. The temperature is now 
read at once and is considered the turbidity point. 

The Valenta test, as generally applied, is simply adding to 3 cc. 
of the sample an equal volume of glacial acetic acid and noting the 
result.

Viscosity is the resistance the smallest particles offer to sliding past 
one another; or, in other words, the internal friction of an oil. The 
viscosity of an oil is determined by ascertaining the time a certain 
amount takes to flow through a given aperture, compared with some 
other substance such as water, glycerin or sperm oil. 

Specific Viscosity 2 is expressed as the number obtained by dividing 
the time of flow of the oil by the time of flow of water at 20 C. 

Viscosity is also often applied to mixtures of miscible liquids and 
salts in solution.

CHAPTER V. 
OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 

The oils, fats and waxes may be grouped in a number of different 
ways, and certain classifications have been proposed, such as: 

Fixed Oils. 

Volatile Oils, 
or they may be divided into three classes, as follows : 

Vegetable Oils < 

Animal Oils. 
Mineral Oils. 

There are a number of vegetable oils that are classed as drying or 
siccative oils because they have the property of absorbing oxygen from 
the atmosphere and forming a varnish. Such oils are used in the 
manufacture of paints : While other oils decompose more or less on ex- 
posure to air and are termed non-drying oils. Such oils are used as 
food, in the manufacture of soap and in medicine. 

The non-mineral fixed oils consist of the elements hydrogen, oxygen 
and carbon; while the hydrocarbon oils or mineral oils consist of two 
elements only, hydrogen and carbon. The class of volatile or essential 
oils may contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and nitrogen. 

The fatty oils, that is, the animal and vegetable fixed oils, are saponi- 
fiable when acted upon by heat, alkalies and certain acids, and furnish 
glycerol and a soap of fatty acids. Such oils are said to be composed of 
glycerides of the fatty acids. The reaction taking place has been de- 
ecribed in Chapter IV, under Saponification. 

The hydrocarbon oils are obtained from oil shales found in Scotland 
and in some other countries, and from petroleum produced in the 
United States and Russia. This class of oils is not used, except to a 
limited extent, in drug and food products, but they are often found as 
adulterants in vegetable and animal oils. Hydrocarbon oils are now 
being advertised for use in medicine. 

The essential or volatile oils are found in many plants distributed 
widely over the earth and are of so great importance that they will be 
considered in detail in a separate chapter. 

Whether fatty glycerides are to be called oils or fats depends upon 
climatic conditions and not upon the chemical composition of the 

81 



82 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

substance. In the United States, when at an average temperature 
they are liquids, they are called oils. The same substances in the 
latitude of Alaska might become solids, and then they would be con- 
sidered fats. Even this distinction is not always observed, as cocoanut 
oil and palm oil, at from 20 C. to 25 C. are generally solids and they 
are not usually referred to as fats. 

The animal oils and fats are distinguished from the vegetable as they 
contain cholesterol, while the vegetable oils are free from same, but 
contain phytosterol, which is not found in animal oils. The hydro- 
carbon oils are free from cholesterol as well as phytosterol and as a 
general rule are unsaponifiable. 

Vegetable and animal oils and fats are distinguished from waxes as 
upon saponification they produce glycerin and fatty acids. Under 
similar treatment the waxes produce higher alcohols and fatty acids. 
Chemically speaking, sperm oil should be called " sperm wax," as upon 
saponification fatty acids and higher alcohols are produced.

OLEUM AMYGDALAE EXPRESSUM. 
Expressed Oil of Almond. 

French Huile cTamande. German Mandelol. Italian Olio di

A fixed oil obtained from the kernels of varieties of Prunus Amyg- 
dalus Stokes (Fam. Rosaceae) U.S. P. Almonds are chiefly produced in 
Morocco, Canary Islands, Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Syria and 
Persia; and cultivated in California and extensively in Sicily. 

The United States imported during the year ending June 30, 1918, 
38,939 pounds of sweet almond oil.

Principal Components. Almond oil consists almost exclusively of 
glycerides of olein and a small amount of linolic acid without stearin. 

Preparation and Yield. The seeds yield from 48 to 50 per cent, 
of oil. They are ground and then enclosed in canvas bags and pressed 
between steel plates. Sweet almonds yield amounts as high as above 
figures, while the bitter almonds yield from 36 to 38 per cent, of oil. 

Properties and Tests. Expressed oil of almonds is a clear, pale 
straw-colored, oily liquid, almost colorless, and having a bland taste. 
U.S.P. 

The constants of the fixed oils produced from either the sweet or 
bitter almonds are practically identical. 

Lewkowitsch 1 states, contrary to older statements, almond oil does 
not easily turn rancid. 

Possible adulterants are olive, cottonseed, peanut and sesame oils, 
but as almond oil forms a clear solution with an equal volume of 
alcohol and the above mentioned oils are less soluble in alcohol, they 
would be easily detected. 

The most probable adulterants are apricot and peach kernel oils 
which are detected in mixtures of almond oil with great difficulty. 
However, almond oil has a higher iodine number than either of the 
others and apricot oil gives an orange color with nitric acid, specific 
gravity 1.4. Peach kernel oil gives a yellowish-brown color, while 
almond oil remains colorless when shaken with the acid. 

Bieber's Test. Mix equal parts by weight of fuming nitric acid and 
concentrated sulphuric acid. Add one cc. of the mixture to 5 cc. of the 
oil and mix. Almond oil does not change color while apricot kernel 
oil gives a pink color and peach kernel oil a faint pink coloration upon 
standing. The reagent should be prepared freshly for the test. 

Kreis* Phloroglucinol Test. One-tenth per cent, phloroglucinol 
in ether applied in the presence of nitric acid of 1.45 specific gravity 
will give a red coloration if either peach kernel oil or apricot kernel 
oil is present, while there is no change in color with almond oil. 

Lewkowitsch 2 states, owing to the uncertainty of Bieber's and the 
Phloroglucinol tests, the utmost care should be employed as in Bieber's

test, with an almond oil containing 25 per cent, of apricot kernel oil, 
very little coloration is observed, and it takes one-third of apricot oil 
when mixed with almond oil to give a distinct color test. With the 
Kreis test the reaction is less certain. 

Uses. Almond oil is used pharmaceutically in the manufacture of 
emulsions and ointments. " Marzipan" 1 is a confection prepared by 
mixing two parts of pounded almonds with one part of sugar. 

By-Products. The marc of bitter almonds is distilled with water to 
obtain the volatile oil of almonds, Oleum Amygdalae Amarae of the 
Pharmacopoeia.

of the world's supply of this oil is produced in Southern United States; 
the balance in India, Egypt, Russia, China, Brazil and small quantities 
in other countries. 

The United States produced, imported and exported for the years 
1918, 1919 and 1920 the following amounts of cottonseed oil:

Total 99.8 per cent. 

Preparation and Yield. As early as 1763 2 the extraction of oil 
from cotton seeds was suggested, but it was not expressed successfully 
until 1847. 

The seeds are freed from sand, cotton and hulls, crushed, heated in 
steam-jacketed vessels and the oil expressed by hydraulic pressure or 
by an expeller press. This latter method is described by Bailey 3 as 
follows: "Expeller Press An increasing amount of crude cottonseed 
oil is made in mills equipped with a type of continuous-working press 
known as the expeller. The expeller is built somewhat on the principle 
of an ordinary meat grinder, and is simply an interrupted screw, re- 
volving inside a slotted steel barrel. The ground seed enters through 
a hopper at one end of the barrel, is pressed along toward the opposite 
end, and finally discharged around a cone which can be set in or out 
of the outlet orifice to give any desired pressure. Squeezed from the 
seed by the pressure of the screw, the oil runs out through the small 
slits in the barrel, and, after settling, or better, filtering through a 
filter press, is ready for shipment to the refinery."

The crude oil, which is ruby red to almost black in color, is refined 
by adding sufficient caustic soda solution to combine with the coloring 
matter and free fatty acids. The mixture is allowed to settle, two 
layers forming. The upper layer will consist of the decolorized oil and 
the lower layer will contain the brown coloring matter, together with 
the soap formed by the action of the caustic soda in the free fatty acids. 

The oil after being freed from the foots is further clarified with 
fuller's earth. 

The yield of oil has been found to be from 17.5 to about 24 per cent, 
of the whole seed. However, the commercial yield is nearer the lower 
figure. 

Properties and Tests. The Federal 1 standard of cottonseed pro- 
ducts are as follows: 

Cottonseed oil is the oil obtained from the seeds of cotton plants (Gossypium 
hirsutum L., G. barbadense L., G. herbaceum L.) and subjected to the usual refining 
process; is free from rancidity; has a refractive index (25 C.) not less than one and 
forty-seven hundred ten-thousandths (1.4700) and not exceeding one and forty- 
seven hundred and twenty-five ten-thousandths (1.4725); and an iodine number not 
less than one hundred and four (104) and not exceeding one hundred and ten (110). 

"Winter-yellow" cottonseed oil is expressed cottonseed oil from which a portion 
of the stearin has been separated by chilling and pressure, and has an iodine number 
not less than one hundred and ten (110) and not exceeding one hundred and sixteen 
(116). 

Cottonseed oil stearin is the solid product made by chilling cottonseed oil and 
separating the solid portion by filtration, with or without pressure, and having an 
iodine number of not less than eighty-five (85) and not more than one hundred (100). 

Cottonseed oil is a pale yellow, oily liquid, colorless, nearly odorless, 
and having a bland taste. U.S. P. The high melting and solidifying 
points of the fatty acids are characteristics of cottonseed oil. It is 
distinguished from corn oil by the titer test of its fatty acids. Linseed 
oil would be detected by the hexabromides and high iodine value. 

The Halphen Color Test should be applied to detect the presence of 
cottonseed oil. G. Halphen 2 in 1894 first called attention to the color 
reactions of cottonseed oil with certain chemicals and in 1897 3 he an- 
nounced the method which is now so well known as " Halphen Test." 
The Association of Agricultural Chemists 4 directs the applying of this 
test as follows: 

Mix carbon disulphide, containing about 1 per cent, of sulphur in 
solution, with an equal volume of amyl alcohol. Mix equal volumes of

this reagent and the oil under examination and heat in a bath of boiling, 
saturated brine for 1 to 2 hours. In the presence of as little as 1 per 
cent, of cottonseed oil a characteristic red or orange-red color is 
produced. 

Lard and lard oil from animals fed on cottonseed meal will give a 
faint reaction. Their fatty acids also give this reaction. 

The depth of color is proportional, to a certain extent, to the amount 
of oil present, and by making comparative tests with cottonseed oil 
some idea as to the amount present can be obtained. Different oils 
react with different intensities, and oils which have been heated from 
200 to 210 C. 1 react with greatly diminished intensity. Heating 
ten minutes at 250 C. renders cottonseed oil incapable of giving the 
reaction. 2 

Holde 3 claims the Halphen reaction is not given by blown oils that 
have been treated with fuming hydrochloric acid, or with chlorine or 
sulphurous acid. Moore, Richter and Van Arsdel 4 claim that hydro- 
genation of cottonseed oil will destroy the response to the Halphen 
test, provided the degree of hydrogenation causes a drop in the iodine 
value of about four units. 

Bechi's 5 Test was first announced in 1887 and was given as a reliable 
test for detection of cottonseed oil in olive oil. About the same time 
Milliau 6 announced a similar test, the difference being that Bechi 
applied his test directly to the oil and Milliau separated the fatty 
acids to which he applied the test. The test is now known under the 
name of Bechi's Test and applied as follows: 7 

Dissolve 2 grams of silver nitrate in 200 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol 
and 40 cc. of ether, adding 1 drop of nitric acid. 

Mix 10 cc. of oil or melted fat with 5 cc. of the above reagent and 
10 cc. of amyl alcohol in a test tube. Divide, heat one half in a boiling 
water bath for ten minutes and compare with the portion not heated. 
Any blackening due to reduced silver shows presence of cottonseed oil. 

Bechi 8 in his original test used two reagents as follows: 

1. Silver nitrate 1. 

Alcohol 200. 

Ether 40. 

Nitric acid 0.1 

2. Amyl alcohol 100. 

Colza-oil (rapeseed oil) 15.

The test is applied by shaking 10 cc. of the sample with 1 cc. of 
reagent No. 1 and 10 cc. of reagent No. 2. The mixture is then heated 
at 100 C. for a quarter of an hour. If the liquid assumes a brown 
color the oil in question contains at least 15 per cent, of cottonseed oil. 
With a smaller addition of cottonseed oil the reaction is uncertain. 

Milliau 1 has shown that kapok and baobab-seed oils reduce silver 
nitrate as well as give the Halphen reaction. A means of distinguish- 
ing them from cottonseed oil is the fact that the reduction of the silver 
nitrate does not take place by the fatty acids of the latter oil until 
heated, while the fatty acids of kapok and baobab-seed oil cause the 
reduction in the cold. 

Uses. Cottonseed oil is used as a salad oil and as an adulterant for 
olive oil; also, in making compound lard, and many substitutes for 
lard which are sold under coined or fancy names ; in the manufacture of 
oleomargarine, cottolene and crisco. In the United States for the 
year 1917, cottonseed oil entered into 1,069,214,000 pounds of lard 
substitutes. In the manufacture of lard and butter substitutes cotton- 
seed stearin is used. This product is prepared by cooling the cotton- 
seed oil and draining off the liquid and finally pressing the solid. The 
oil is used to a limited extent as a lubricant, and in the manufacture of 
paints. 

Crisco, or similar hydrogenated preparations prepared from cotton- 
seed oil, are extensively sold to be used for all purposes in place of 
lard. Under the Burchenal 2 patent, the manufacturers of crisco 
claim the exclusive right to hydrogenize vegetable oils in whole or in 
part and make the following products: 

1. A homogeneous lard-like food product consisting of an incompletely hydro- 
genized vegetable oil. 

2. A homogeneous lard-like food product consisting of incompletely hydrogenized 
cottonseed oil.

stearin. It is claimed that vegetole differs slightly from lard, and that 
it is not a substitute but an alternative for lard. 

Linimentum Camphorae, U. S. P. Camphor Liniment. Camphor- 
ated Oil. Camphor liniment or, as generally called, camphorated oil is 
simply cottonseed oil 80 per cent, and camphor 20 per cent, by weight. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia Assay Process is as follows: 

Weigh 25 grams of Camphor Liniment into a tared 150 cc. flask and connect this 
flask with a 500 cc. distillation flask containing 275 cc. of alcohol. Adjust the tube 
from the distillation flask so that it reaches to within 0.5 cm. of the bottom of the 
flask containing the liniment and connect the latter flask with a condenser. Now 
heat both flasks on sand baths and regulate the temperature so that alcohol vapors 
will pass rapidly through the Liniment without condensing. Receive the distillate 
in a flask graduated to 250 cc. and continue the distillation until, at 25 C., the distillate 
measures 250 cc. Fill a 200 mm. polariscope tube with the distillate and take the 
mean of four or more readings of the rotation, beginning at zero each time. The 
temperature correction for each degree is half a minute, additive if above, subtractive 
if below 25 C. Place about 20 grams of the Camphor Liniment in an evaporating 
dish, 9 cm. in diameter. Place the dish on a wire gauze 10 cm. above a Bunsen burner 
having a flame 4 cm. high. When the camphor has all sublimed, dissolve 0.5 gram 
of the sublimate in sufficient alcohol to make exactly 25 cc. at 25 C. and take the 
mean of four or more polariscope readings as before. The minutes of rotation of 
the distillate, divided by the minutes of rotation of the control test just made, and 
multiplied by 20, will give the number of grams of camphor in 100 Gm. of Camphor 
Liniment. 

Leonard and Smith 1 determined the amount of camphor in camphor- 
ated oil by heating 3 to 5 grams in a flat bottomed dish at 120 C. for 
two hours. When prepared with olive oil they found the oil gained 
in weight, by heating, 0.15 per cent, and this amount should be added 
to the loss in weight on heating the sample. 

In case the camphor is determined by loss in heating the oil a polari- 
scopic reading should be made. The United States Pharmacopoeia 
only recognizes natural camphor which is dextrorotatory while syn- 
thetic camphor would give a neutral rotation. 

Later 2 the same authors suggested the determination of camphorated 
oil by means of the polariscope, as each degree of rotation is equal to 
1 per cent, of camphor in the oil when a 200 mm. tube is used, and the 
reading of the polariscope gives, without calculation, the percentage of 
camphor present, 

Richardson and Walton 3 confirm the results of Leonard and Smith, 
but use a Schmidt and Haensch polariscope with a 100 mm. tube. 
The reading multiplied by 0.69 will give the percentage of camphor

in camphorated oil. This figure divided by 0.915, the specific gravity 
of cottonseed oil at 25 C., gives grams of camphor in 100 grams of oil. 

The writer has always obtained satisfactory results by heating 2 or 3 
grams in a flat bottomed dish for six or eight hours in a water bath 
oven. It is well to stir the oil from time to time during the heating. 
This is checked by direct polarization of the oil by using a Schmidt and 
Haensch polariscope as suggested by Richardson and Walton. This is 
much shorter than the U.S. P. method and is satisfactory for all prac- 
tical purposes. 

Cook 1 polarizes in a 200 mm. tube. The reading at 25 C. should be 
+58.5 V ., which indicates 1 per cent, camphor for each 2.925 V. By 
using this factor the percentage of camphor in any sample may be 
readily calculated from the polarization. As the polarization of 
cottonseed oil is neutral, no correction is necessary.

By-Products. Cottonseed was at one time considered simply as a 
by-product, but since about 1870 cottonseed oil has ranked highly 
as a food product and there are a number of important by-products 
in the manufacture of the oil; chiefly might be mentioned oil cake 
(each ton of seed produces 700 pounds) which is used as a stock food, 
as well as in fertilizers. Nearly 45 per cent, of the whole seed is hulls, 
which are used as a fertilizer, as a new material for paper making, and 
as a stock food.

The foots are separated from the matter and are used in soap making 
and in the manufacture of paint. 

Marchlewski, Wilson, Strood and Stewart 1 extract from crude cotton- 
seed oil, or the foots, a coloring matter they call gossypol. Condensed 
with nitrosodimethylaniline and nitrosodiethylaniline in alcohol or 
acetic acid, gossypol yields dyestuffs which dye from acetic acid or 
alcoholic solution, cotton and wool, mordanted with iron, chromium 
or tin, producing yellow-brown or brown colors. 

Sapo Mollis. Soft soap is prepared by saponifying cottonseed oil 
with potassium hydroxide. The residue from treating 5 grams with 
hot alcohol should not exceed 3 per cent. The alkalinity of the al- 
coholic filtrate from the 5 grams should not show less than 0.1 per cent, 
nor more than 0.25 per cent, of potassium hydroxide. Each cc. of 
decinormal acid used corresponds to 0.00561 grams of potassium 
hydroxide. It should contain not over 52 per cent, of water. 

The iodine value of the fatty acids should be between 110 and 111. 
Saponification value from 201 to 208.

Boughton 1 states that from sixteen samples of pure linseed oil the 
ash ranged from 0.02 to 0.217 and that they contained manganese 
from a trace to 0.0008 per cent, of the oil. 

Preparation and Yield. The seed is crushed and the oil expressed 
by hydraulic pressure, or by the use of an expeller press. The better 
grades of linseed oil are cold pressed, but in the United States the oil is 
generally hot pressed. 

For some time, linseed oil was made by the "new process" ex- 
tracting the oil from the ground seed with volatile solvents, such as 
benzol or benzene but owing to the great danger from fire by this 
method its use has been altogether discontinued in this country. 

The seed contains from 35 to 40 per cent, of oil, but on pressing, 
there remains in the cake 6J to 10 per cent, of the oil. 

The oil is refined by treating it with 1 to 2 per cent, of sulphuric 
acid. The charred mass carries down the impurities. The oil is

then washed and boiled with water. After settling the foots are 
drawn off and are used in the manufacture of soap and low grade 
paints. 

Linseed oil is purified for the preparation of varnish by cooling to 
its solidifying point, then allowing the temperature to rise until the 
oil can be filtered. At this temperature (below C.) the separated 
albuminous impurities are removed by filtration. 1 

Gill 2 states that oil may be bleached for varnish-makers' use by 
heating to 260 to 300 C., or by forcing oxygen through the oil. 

Properties and Tests. Linseed oil is a yellowish, oily liquid, having 
a peculiar odor and bland taste. When exposed to the air it gradually 
oxidizes and thickens, darkens in color and acquires a strong odor and 
taste. It is soluble in turpentine, ether, chloroform, carbon tetra- 
chloride, carbon disulphide, petroleum benzine and acetone; slightly 
soluble in alcohol. 

Hexabromide Value is the number of grams of hexabromides ob- 
tained from 100 grams of fatty acids. ' 

Hexabromide determination is made according to Hehner and 
Mitchell 3 by dissolving 1 to 2 grams of oil in 40 cc. of ether. Aci- 
dulate the solution with acetic acid and cool to 5 C. Bromine is 
added, drop by drop, until the solution is permanently of a brown 
color. Let the mixture stand 3 hours, then filter through asbestos; 
wash the filtrate with 5 cc. each of glacial acetic acid, alcohol, and 
finally with ether. Dry the precipitate at 100 C., cool and weigh. 
Linseed oil should yield from 23 to 38 per cent, hexabromides, while 
the mixed fatty acids yield 30 to 42 per cent. 

Ingle 4 states that the hexabromides from linseed oil of undoubted 
purity run from 33.7 to 48.1 per cent.; while Eibner and Muggenthaler 5 
state that the fatty acids of linseed oil yield from 50.5 to 57.96 per cent, 
of hexabromides. 

Rosin oil is used as an adulterant of linseed oil and is detected by 
the Liebermann-Storch Reaction. 6 This test is applied as follows: 
One or two cc. of the sample is shaken with 1 cc. of acetic anhydride, 
and then allowed to settle. The acetic anhydride is pipetted off, and 
on adding one drop of sulphuric acid to it, a violet-red color is produced, 
if the sample contains any rosin oil. This test was originally employed 
to detect rosin oil in mineral lubricating oils. Storch calls attention

to the fact that it can not be used in testing the rosin oil in many fat 
oils, as certain vegetable and animal oils give a redaction with this 
reagent. This is due to the cholesterol or phytosterol present. 

If linseed oil is adulterated with rosin oil it will be detected by the 
Liebermann-Storch Reaction; however, this test is not absolute, 
especially if fish oil is the adulterant. Gill 1 states that usually men- 
haden oil if present in large quantities will be detected by its odor when 
warmed. For the detection of smaller quantities, and particularly 
of the deodorized oil, resort must be had to the isolation of phytosterol 
and cholesterol. These should be converted into acetates by boiling 
with acetic anhydride, recrystallized from absolute alcohol four or 
five times -until a constant melting point is obtained. Phytosterol 
acetate crystals from linseed oil melt at 128 to 129 C. and if choles- 
terol be present, a much lower melting point is obtained. Rosin oil 
would also be detected by the high dextro-rotatory power. 

If cottonseed oil is present it would be detected by the Halphen 
reaction. 

McGnTs 2 reports upon the examination of 283 samples of linseed 
oil indicate that 18 samples were adulterated and 19 samples were of 
doubtful genuineness. The chief adulterant found was mineral oil. 
This adulterant would be detected by the oil not being completely 
saponifiable. 

It has been proposed to use picric acid as a reagent for the detection 
of mineral oils. Schulz-Kolin 3 states that a solution of commercial 
picric acid in benzine gives a red color with mineral oils. Rosin 
shows the same coloration as mineral oils. It is stated that the 
reaction depends on some impurity in the crude picric acid as the pure 
acid gives no coloration. 

Another color test 4 for mineral oils is to add a freshly prepared 
solution of thiocyanate of iron which produces a bright yellow color 
with pure linseed oil and a brown color with impure samples. Add a 
few drops of methyl alcohol to the oil and after shaking the mixture 
the alcoholic solution remains colorless in case of pure linseed oil, but 
is colored yellow or rose in case hydrocarbon oils are present. When 
the alcoholic layer is treated with potassium ferrocyanide a blue color 
is produced in case the sample contains mineral oil. 

In addition to oils considered as adulterants of linseed oil there are a 
number of semi-drying oils that might be suspected. They all have 
the property, to a more or less extent, of thickening on exposure to

air, absorbing oxygen, gradually drying to a transparent varnish or 
resin. This class includes rapeseed oil, nigerseed oil, corn oil, cotton- 
seed oil, soya bean oil and sesame oil. They would be detected by 
the application of tests for the individual oil and, also, by their lowering 
the constants of linseed oil. As linseed oil is one of the best drying 
oils, and the best drying oils have the highest iodine values, it will be 
found that the addition of any of the adulterants mentioned would 
lower the iodine value. 

" Linseed oil when spread in a thin layer on a glass plate and al- 
lowed to stand in a warm place is gradually converted into a hard, 
transparent resin" (absence of non-drying oils). U.S. P. 

Liverseege and Elstfon 1 call attention to the test which depends 
upon the addition of water to the alcoholic soap solution. Roughly, 
5 grams of the oil are placed in a wide mouth, glass flask of 250 cc. 
capacity, and 50 cc. of half-normal alcoholic sodium hydroxide added, 
the mouth of the flask is covered with a watch glass and then placed 
on top of a boiling water-oven until saponification is quite complete. 
100 cc. of boiling water are then slowly added to the flask and the 
appearance of the liquid observed. Genuine raw linseed oil will give a 
perfectly clear and bright solution, while that of genuine boiled linseed 
oil is only slightly turbid. As little as 5 per cent, of unsaponifiable 
matter will give a very turbid solution. 

Boiled Linseed Oil is prepared by heating the oil at various tem- 
peratures with certain dryers, such as salts of lead or manganese. The 
oxidized oil changes color and when pale oil is produced it is called 
"pale boiled oil." If the heating is continued until the oil changes 
to a dark color it is called " double boiled oil." The oxidized oil is 
used in all cases where a rapid drying oil is desired. 

The Ohio standard requires that boiled oil shall be prepared by 
heating pure linseed oil to a temperature of 225 F., and incorporating 
not to exceed four per cent, of dryer, and shall have the following 
constants :

Uses. Linseed oil rapidly absorbs atmospheric oxygen and forms a 
tough resinous mass, and it is considered the best known drying oil. 
It is extensively used in the manufacture of paints, varnishes, linoleum, 
printing ink, soap, oil and leather cloth, and rubber substitutes. It 
is also used to a limited extent in veterinary medicine. 

By-Products. The by-products in the manufacture of linseed oil 
are of considerable value. The oil cake is ground and sold extensively 
as a stock food, and the foots from the refining of the oil are used in 
the manufacture of soap and low grade paints.

A fixed oil obtained from the fresh livers of Gadus morrhua Linne, 
and of other species of Gadus (Fam. Gadidae). 

The cod are native of the Norwegian and Newfoundland coasts.

year ending June 30, 1917.

Principal Components. Gane, 1 quoting Heyerdahl's researches, 
states that cod liver oil consists of two glycerides which have not been 
found in any other oil. One, therapin, a combination of therapic acid 
(Ci7H 2 602) with glycerin; and jecolein, a combination of jecoleic 
acid (Ci9H 36 2 ) with glycerin. Both of these acids are unsaturated 
and belong to the oleic acid group; however, olein and stearin were 
shown not to exist in cod liver oil. It contains about 4 per cent, of 
palmitin. Heyerdahl believes the remainder of the oil consists of 
glycerides in combination with one or more unsaturated acids belong- 
ing to the oleic series. It is questionable as to iodine or phosphoric

OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 105 

acid being naturally present in cod liver oil. Cholesterol is a charact- 
eristic constituent of cod liver oil and may be isolated by sap- 
onifying the oil and exhausting the soap with ether. The ether is 
evaporated and the residue crystallized from alcohol. The per- 
centage of cholesterol present varies from 0.46 to 1.32. 

Preparation. Cod liver oil is prepared by extracting the oil from 
the livers by heating them in a hot water pan holding about 80 gallons 
of livers. This pan is placed over another pan or fitted with a double 
bottom for hot water or steam. The livers are stirred continuously 
for four hours, the oil being dipped off as fast as it rises to the surface. 
This method was introduced into Norway in 1853. 

Another method of extracting cod liver oil, which is preferable, is to 
run steam directly into boilers holding from 50 to 100 gallons of livers, 
thereby churning the livers and rendering a white, sweet oil in thirty 
to forty minutes. 

The best grades of cod liver oil are rectified by freezing. This 
method was kept secret in Norway for a number of years, but finally 
became known by manufacturers of Newfoundland in 1887. By 
freezing, the stearin is settled out and is removed by pressing and 
filtering through very fine muslin bags. The oil so prepared will re- 
main clear and bright at a very low temperature. 

Properties and Tests. Cod liver oil is a pale yellow, thin, oily 
liquid, having a peculiar, slightly fishy, but not rancid odor, and a 
fishy taste. It is soluble in ether, chloroform, carbon disulphide and 
ethyl acetate. Slightly soluble in alcohol. 

Allen 1 claims that the so-called commercial cod oils are mixtures of 
oils obtained from all kinds of fish, and usually of a dark brown color, 
and in advanced state of decomposition. Such oils are obtained not 
only from the liver of the fish, but also from the entrails.

analysis of a brown oil.

Tortelli and Jaffe 1 propose the following test: 1 cc. of cod liver oil 
is mixed with 6 cc. of chloroform and 1 cc. ice-cold acetic acid, fol- 
lowed by 40 drops of 40 per cent, solution of bromine in chloroform. 
A pink color appears within one minute, rapidly changing to an in- 
tensive green. They claim liver oils from all sea animals respond to 
this test, and that vegetable oils give a yellowish to a brown color, 
while oil of land animals give a yellowish-green. 

The U.S. P. tests are as follows: "A solution of 1 drop of the oil in 
1 cc. of chloroform, when shaken with 1 drop of sulphuric acid, ac- 
quires a violet-red tint, gradually changing to reddish-brown." This 
test applies equally as well to many other fish oils, as they give the 
violet color. 

"Allow 2 or 3 drops of fuming nitric acid (specific gravity about 1.44) 
to flow alongside of 10 to 15 drops of the oil contained in a watch glass; 
a reddish or purplish color is produced at the zone of contact. On 
stirring the mixture with a glass rod, this color becomes bright rose-red 
(distinction from seal oil, which shows no change in color, and from 
other fish oils, which become blue)." 

Cod liver oil should not contain more than a trace of volatile fatty 
acids and if the Reichert-Meissl value is higher than 0.40 it would 
indicate that the oil had been obtained from stale livers. 

Uses. Large quantities of cod liver oil are used in medicine in the 
form of emulsions. Its medicinal value is probably due to the facility 
with which it is digested and assimilated. 

It is used in leather dressings. 

By-Products. About the only by-product of commercial value in 
the preparation of cod liver oil is the stearin, which is used in the 
manufacture of soaps.

The Federal Standard 1 for Olive Oil. Olive oil is the oil obtained from the sound, 
mature fruit of the cultivated olive tree (Olea europoea L.) and subjected to the 
usual refining process; is free from rancidity; has a refractive index (25 C.) not less 
than one and forty-six hundred and sixty ten-thousandths (1.4660) and not exceeding 
one and forty-six hundred and eighty ten-thousandths (1.4680), and an iodine number 
not less than seventy-nine (79) and not exceeding ninety (90). 

Virgin olive oil is olive oil obtained from the first pressing of carefully selected, 
hand-picked olives. 

Principal Components. Olive oil consists of about 96.56 per cent, 
liquid fatty acids of which approximately 93 per cent, is glycerides of 
oleic acid and 7 per cent, linolic acid. The solid fatty acid of olive 
oil is regarded as palmitic. Rancid olive oil contains formic, acetic, 
butyric and other less common acids. 

Preparation and Yield. The olive tree is an evergreen of great 
longevity and grows to a height of about forty feet. For the best 
grade of olive oil the olives are hand-picked just before they become 
fully ripe and before they begin to soften. The olives are crushed in 
large flat pans by immense wheels and the crushed fruit put into closely 
woven baskets or in heavy sacks which are piled on top of each other 
and subjected to hydraulic pressure. In case the pits have been re- 
moved, the first run of olive oil produces what is known as " virgin" 
olive oil. If the pits are crushed with the pulp and pressed, there is 
produced a mixture of olive and olive kernel oil, the latter having, 
however, about the same constants as the oil from the pulp. A second 
quality oil is produced by regrinding the marc and adding cold water 
and repressing. Thereby a good grade of oil is produced which is 
sometimes mixed with the " virgin" oil. When hot water is added 
to the marc and repressed a larger yield of oil is produced but of a 
poor quality. The oil is run into settling tanks, the water and small 
particles of pulp settle to the bottom and the oil is drawn off from the 
top. The ripe olives contain from 40 to 50 per cent, of oil. 

Goodrich's 2 method of preparing olive oil is as follows : 

Olives are picked when the average is ripe, but not dead ripe. They are spread 
on trays and allowed to evaporate a portion of the "water of vegetation" before 
pressing. They are crushed in an old-fashioned crusher, having a revolving granite 
wheel worked by horse-power, and pressed in Italian oil sacks (bruscole), which are

made of a kind of rush (guinco marine), which are imported for the purpose. Prac- 
tically all of the work is done by "rule of thumb;" i.e., by careful study of the con- 
dition of the olives, etc. The temperature of the pressing room is kept at about 
70 F. but the olives are not heated and come in cold. The run of 'a pressure is a 
mixture of water and oil, fine material of the olive, and oil. After the run has stood 
a short time the oil has in part come to the surface and the water sunk to the bottom 
with an intermediate stratum of a mixture of oil, water, and fine material. The 
oil is skimmed off the surface as soon as it appears in sufficient quantity, and this 
skimming is continued indefinitely until the oil is called for and filtered for bottling. 
The process is the old one in use in all the old countries where oil is expressed. 

GiffordV method of preparing olive oil is as follows : 

Only ripe olives are used. The fruit is first crushed in a large stone basin by 
means of a revolving stone wheel; it is then taken to the presses, where the oil and 
juice are separated from the pomace. The oil and juice are then passed through a 
cold water separator, where they come in contact with a stream of pure spring water 
under heavy pressure, which thoroughly washes and removes from the oil all vegetable 
matter. Next it goes to the racking tanks where it is thoroughly racked and allowed 
to clarify. It is now taken to the filter room and filtered through paper, made for 
this purpose, directly into the bottles. 

The utmost care and cleanliness are absolutely necessary in the making of high 
grade olive oil the product being very susceptible to taint. 

The cold-water separator mentioned by Gifford consists of a tank 
about four feet high by two in diameter. The tank is kept full of 
fresh water. Hurst 2 states "the juices and oil from the press, charged 
with oil in an emulsified state, are made to flow into a tank near the 
bottom, through a small drum perforated on the top, from which a 
stream of fresh water escapes in vertical jets. These two currents of 
oil and fresh water at once mix and the oil passes upward by reason of 
lightness. Being in very small drops, it is washed of its heavier im- 
purities (tissue, coloring matter, etc.) and reaches the top of the column 
of water in an almost perfectly clean state, having left the grosser 
impurities to be carried off through an escape pipe at the bottom." 

Properties and Tests. Olive oil is a pale yellow oil, or light, green- 
ish-yellow, oily liquid, having a slight, peculiar odor and taste, with a 
faintly acrid after-taste. U.S. P. Slightly soluble in alcohol, but 
miscible with ether, chloroform, or carbon disulphide. 

Color. The green color of olive oil may be due to chlorophyll of 
the unripe fruit, or to the addition of copper salts. Copper may be 
detected by dissolving the oil with ether and shaking out the solution 
with dilute sulphuric acid which will remove the green color if copper 
is present. Draw off the acid liquid and test for copper in the usual 
manner.

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



Free Acid in olive oil is caused by allowing the pulp to ferment before 
the oil is expressed or by storing the oil in a crude state. Oil that is 
filtered as soon as expressed, to remove insoluble impurities, does not 
increase in acidity by storage. Tolman and Munson 1 found in olive 
oils (California) the free fatty acids, as oleic, to run from 0.20 to 44.40 
per cent, with an average of 1.20 per cent. Lewkowitsch 2 states that 
olive oil containing more than 5 per cent, of free fatty acids is not 
suitable for lubricating purposes. The best grades of edible olive oil 
should contain less than 0.5 per cent, of free fatty acids. 

The United States Treasury Department 3 states that the weight of 
a Standard United States gallon of olive oil at 68 F. (20 C.) varies 
between 7.554 pounds and 7.649 pounds, the average being 7.61 
pounds; and that for all commercial purposes the average value of 
7.61 pounds may be taken as the weight of a gallon of olive oil at 68 F. 
(20 C.). 

When cooled to 6 C. it becomes solid, depositing palmitin. 

When mixed with nitrous acid it forms a solid elaidin. 

Olive oil has been largely adulterated in this country with cotton- 
seed oil. Other adulterants sesame oil, sunflower oil, corn oil, 
peanut oil and mineral oils are occasionally found. 

Since the enactment of the Federal Food and Drug Laws, out of 
nearly one hundred cases of adulterated olive oil the adulterant, in 
nearly every instance, has been cottonseed oil.

As the constants of arachis oil and olive oil are so nearly the same, 
the most reliable test for the presence of arachis oil is the quantitative 
determination of arachidic acid. Although olive oil contains a small 
amount of arachidin it does not interfere with the approximate de- 
termination of the quantity of arachis oil present by using a factor 
5 per cent, arachidic acid in pure arachis oil. For method of determin- 
ing arachidic acid, see peanut oil. 

Archbutt 1 has found arachidic acid in rape and mustard oils, and 
states that the fact of finding arachidic acid in olive oil is not conclusive 
proof of the presence of arachis oil, unless rape and mustard oils are 
proved to be absent. 

Parry 2 claims that 10 per cent, and often as low as 5 per cent, of 
arachis oil may be detected in olive oil by the following method: 
Saponify one cc. of the oil with 5 cc. of an 8.5 per cent, solution of 
ordinary potassium hydroxide in absolute alcohol. Exactly neutralize 
with 90 per cent, acetic acid, and then add 50 cc. of 70 per cent, alcohol 
containing 1 per cent, of ordinary laboratory hydrochloric acid. Cool 
to 18 C. to 20 C. In the presence of 10 per cent., often as low as 
5 per cent., of nut oil, crystals of arachidic acid will separate. In 
general, pure olive oil will remain quite clear, but occasionally a 
sample will give a slight flocculent deposit easily distinguished from 
arachidic acid. 

Sesame Oil would be detected by Baudouin or Villavecchia tests. 
Owing to the color reaction obtained by Baudouin test in olive oil 
purported to be free from sesame oil, Gassend 3 states if a little of a 
10 per cent, solution of sodium hydrogen sulphite be added the red 
coloration produced by olive oil will be very quickly discharged ; where- 
as, the color produced by sesame oil will not be discharged for 12 to 
40 minutes. 

Corn Oil and Sunflower Oil have higher specific gravities and iodine 
values than olive oil. One sample claimed to be olive oil and cotton- 
seed oil proved upon analysis by the U. S. Department of Agriculture, 
Bureau of Chemistry to be sunflower oil. It was labeled " Olio Puro 
Sopraffino Rafaele D'Angeli Lucca, Italy" " Cottonseed Oil." 

Mineral Oils used to adulterate olive oil would lower the saponi- 
fication value. 

Salad Oil. The Board of Food and Drug Inspection 4 has decided 
that there is no objection to using the term " Salad Oil" on oils other 
than olive oil, when such oils are pure, harmless and edible, provided

the term " Salad Oil" be plainly qualified by the common name of the 
oil or oils actually used. 

Before this ruling, a case was brought against a dealer for selling 
an oil labeled " Imported Salad Oil, Morel Brand," 1 which upon 
analysis proved to be simply sesame oil. The contention was that 
the label was deceptive and would indicate olive oil. The jury re- 
turned a verdict of "guilty" and the counsel for the defendant moved 
to set aside the verdict, which was denied. The case was carried to the 
United States Court of Appeals which reversed the judgment of the 
lower court and the cause was remanded for a new trial. Upon 
motion of the United States Attorney the case was disposed of by 
entering a nolle prosequi. 

Sweet Oil. The Board of Food and Drug Inspection 2 have held 
that the term "Sweet Oil" is synonymous with olive oil and that any 
oil other than olive oil is misbranded when sold under the name 
"Sweet Oil." 

Uses. Olive oil is largely used for edible purposes and to a limited 
extent in medicine. In coloring (Turkey Red Oil), as a lubricant under 
the name of gallipoli or engine oil, and in the manufacture of pure 
castile soap. 

By-Products. Olive pomace contains from 7.89 to 20.23 per cent, 
of oil, or 20.98 to 53.81 gallons of oil per ton of fresh pomace. Cruess 
and Christie 3 report that this can be satisfactorily extracted with 
gasoline, the gasoline being subsequently recovered from the oil and 
also from the extracted pomace by distillation. It is stated that 
the extracted oil compares favorably with pure oil for soap making 
purposes. Low grade oils for soap-making and lubricants have 
generally been produced by extracting the marc with carbon disulphide. 

Sapo White Castile Soap. Castile soap is prepared from olive 
oil and sodium hydroxide. 

Castile soap should contain not to exceed 36 per cent, of water in 
the unpowdered soap and not to exceed 10 per cent, of water in the 
powdered soap. 

Impurities such as sodium chloride, sodium carbonate and silica 
are detected by dissolving 10 grams of the sample in 100 cc. of warm 
alcohol and filtering. Wash the residue with boiling alcohol, dry and 
weigh. The weight should not exceed 1 per cent. The alcoholic 
filtrate from above should not be reddened with a few drops of phe- 
nolphthalein (sodium hydroxide).

A fixed oil obtained from the seeds of Ricinus communis Linne (Fam. 
Euphorbiaceae). U.S. P. India produces practically all the castor 
oil seed used commercially. Some authorities state that the seed is 
grown in the United States for commercial purposes. This was true 
some years ago, but up to 1918 they had not been grown commercially 
for a great many years; the seed pressed in this country being im- 
ported from India. England placed an embargo on the shipping of 
the India grown seed to foreign countries owing to the war, and that 
cut off the supply to the United States. In the year 1918 the United 
States Department of Agriculture interested farmers in Florida to 
plant 100,000 acres to castor beans, but owing to inexperience and 
other causes the venture was not a profitable one for the farmers. It 
proved however that the United States can produce the beans and 
need not depend upon foreign countries for their supply. 

Castor oil plants are common in flower gardens as far north as Ohio 
and in the southern United States they grow to immense size, often 
ten to twenty feet high.

The castor oil produced in the United States from imported seed 
for the year 1916 was 9,302,000 pounds, for 1917, 6,188,000 pounds 
and for the year ending June 30, 1918, there were imported 2,913,327

Principal Components. Glycerides of ricinoleic acid and its iso- 
mers, together with a small amount of stearin. Ricinoleic acid has 
a specific rotation of + 6.25 to + 7.5 in acetone solution. 

Preparation and Yield. Castor oil seeds contain from 46 to 53 
per cent, of oil. The seeds are crushed and pressed in small cylindrical 
hydraulic presses. The first pressing produces what is known as 
"cold pressed" oil, and this grade only should be dispensed for medi- 
cinal purposes. There are generally two grades of oil prepared: this 
first pressing which is sold as number one, and the oil which is extracted 
with solvents from the pressed cake, and is commercially known as 
number three castor oil. The latter contains "ricin," a poisonous 
tox-albumen, and ricinine, a white crystalline alkaloid, which are 
contained in the seeds. 

Properties and Tests. Castor oil is a pale yellowish or almost 
colorless, transparent, viscid liquid, having a faint, mild odor and a 
bland, afterwards slightly acrid, and generally nauseating taste. 
U.S.P. 

Castor oil is soluble in glacial acetic acid and miscible with dehy- 
drated alcohol. It is insoluble in ether. Most fixed oils, except 
croton oil, are only dissolved by heating with glacial acetic acid. 
Castor oil is not soluble in petroleum spirit although it will dissolve 
an equal volume of that liquid. Other fixed oils are soluble in petro- 
leum spirit. It is not miscible with mineral lubricating oils, while 
other fixed oils are. miscible in all proportions therewith.

116 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

' i 

Castor oil produces a clear liquid with equal volume of alcohol 
(foreign oils). 

Castor oil is seldom adulterated, but cottonseed oil, rosin oil, poppy- 
seed oil, lard oil, cocoanut oil and sesame oil are possible adulterants. 

Cottonseed oil is recognized by the Halphen reaction. 

Rosin oil would lower the saponification value and also be detected 
by the Liebermann-Storch test. 

Poppyseed oil would lower the specific gravity, acetyl value and 
viscosity. The iodine value would be higher. 

Lard oil would lower the iodine and acetyl value. 

Cocoanut oil would raise the saponification value and lower the 
specific gravity. 

Sesame oil would be detected by the Baudouin reaction. 

Castor oil is dextrorotatory. 

Uses. Castor oil is used in medicine; as a lubricating oil; in soap 
making; in the manufacture of canvas machinery belting; and in the 
preparation of Turkey-red oils. An enormous demand for castor 
oil has been created owing to its use for high-speed airplane motors. 

By-Products. Castor oil cake cannot be used as a stock food owing 
to the presence of "ricin" and the alkaloid ricinine, which are poison- 
ous. 

Nagel 1 claims that "ricin" can be removed from oil cake as it is 
soluble in an aqueous 10 per cent, solution of sodium chloride. 

The powdered castor pomace is mixed with 6 to 7 times its weight 
of the salt solution and allowed to stand 6 to 8 hours. It should be 
thoroughly mixed from time to time. The mass is filter pressed and 
washed with the salt solution until a small portion when heated does 
not produce a precipitate. The cake is then removed and dried. 

The " ricin" may be removed by heating the filtrate and filtering 
while hot. The salt solution so purified may be used again. 

The "ricin-free" oil cake is used as a stock food. The ordinary 
oil cake is used as a fertilizer. 

Turkey-Red Oil. This oil is not exactly a by-product, but is gener- 
ally prepared from the low grade castor oil. When castor and a 
number of other fatty oils are sulphonated by treating them with 
an excess of strong sulphuric acid and keeping the temperature below 
25 C. turkey-red or alizarin oil is produced. The excess of acid is 
removed by washing with water and a solution of sodium sulphate. 
Ammonia or soda is then added until a complete emulsion is formed. 

"The main components of the mixture are alkali salts of ricinoleic 
and ricinoleo-sulphuric acid, besides some neutral fat and perhaps 

1 J, Soc. Chem, Ind., 1902, 21, 31.

anhydrides of ricinolic acid. The ricinoleo-sulphuric acid is formed 
by the union of sulphuric acid with the ricinoleic acid split from castor 
oil, water being eliminated." 1 

The reaction is represented as follows : 

CisHgsCVOH + H 2 SO 4 = CisHgaCVOSOsH + H 2 O. 

Properties and Tests. Turkey-red oil is miscible with water in all 
proportions. The aqueous solution forms a lather like soap. 

Holde 1 claims turkey-red oil should have the following composition : 

The water-soluble part of fat 9.5 

Neutral fat 1.3 

Insoluble part (Fatty acids) 47.2 

Total fat 58^0 

Ammonia 1.8 

Total sulphuric acid 4.6 

and further states that the total fatty matter determines in a large 
degree the value of a turkey-red oil, and gives a method of determining 
the same as follows: 

Benedict's Method. Four grams of oil in 20 cc. of water (if turbid, 
ammonia is added to faint alkalinity) are treated with 15 cc. of (1:1) 
sulphuric acid and 3 grams of stearic acid, and heated to boiling to 
separate the fat; on cooling, the cake is washed free from mineral acid. 
From the weight of the residue the weight of the added stearic acid is 
subtracted.

Sesame oil is a fixed oil obtained from the seeds of one or more culti- 
vated varieties of Sesamum indicum Linne (Fam. Pedaliaceae). 

The sesame plant is indigenous to India and is cultivated in China, 
Japan and the countries bordering on the Mediterranean sea. For 
the year ending June 30, 1920, the United States imported 5,237,695 
pounds of sesame oil.

rancidity; has a refractive index (25 C.) not less than one and forty-seven hundred 
and four ten-thousandths (1.4704) and not exceeding one and forty-seven hundred 
and seventeen ten-thousandths (1.4717); and an iodine number not less than one 
hundred and three (103) and not exceeding one hundred and twelve (112). 
"Cold-drawn" sesame oil is sesame oil obtained by pressure without heating. 

Principal Components. Lane 1 obtained 78.5 per cent, of liquid 
fatty acids, having an iodine value of 139.9; titer test 21.4, and saponi- 
fication value 189.2. The liquid fatty acids consist of oleic and 
linolic acids. 

Preparation and Yield. Sesame seed yield from 50 to 57 per cent, 
of oil which is obtained from the ground seed by pressure. The best 
grades of the cold pressed oil are as wholesome as olive oil. The final 
pressing made by heating produces an oil that is used for technical 
purposes. 

Properties and Tests. Sesame oil is a pale yellow, oily liquid, 
almost odorless, and having a bland taste. It is slightly soluble in 
alcohol, miscible with ether, chloroform, petroleum benzin, or carbon 
disulphide. U.S.P. 

Two color tests are in general use for the detection of sesame oil: 

(1) Villa vecchia and Fabris use an alcoholic solution of furfurol; 

(2) Baudouin's is essentially the same as above, as hydrochloric 
acid and sucrose are used; the acid inverting the sugar and then 
further acting upon the levulose producing furfurol. 

Villavecchia and Fabris' 2 Furfurol Test is applied as follows : As 
hydrochloric acid will give a violet shade with furfurol, it is necessary 
to use a very dilute solution, e.g. 2 per cent, in alcohol. One tenth 
cc. of furfurol solution is placed in a test tube and 10 cc. of the oil, 
10 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.20) added. The mixture is shaken 
for half a minute and allowed to settle. In the presence of sesame oil, 
even in smaller quantity than 1 per cent, the aqueous layer at the 
bottom of the tube becomes a definite carmine color. 

Baudouin's Test is applied as follows: Two cc. of the sample are 
treated with 1 cc. of hydrochloric acid of 1.20 specific gravity, con- 
taining 1 per cent, of sugar. The mixture should be shaken for half 
a minute and then add 3 cc. of water and again shake. If sesame oil 
is present the acid layer will be colored crimson. 

Uses. Sesame oil is used in medicine and also as an edible oil. It 
was made official in the U.S.P. IX. 

In 1884, Alcock 3 recommended the use of sesame oil in the prepara- 
tion of ammonia liniment, claiming that the oil does not separate by

standing and that the liniment remains of a beautiful creamy con- 
sistence. 

The U.S. P. IX ammonia liniment is prepared with sesame oil. 

A very palatable confection is prepared in the Mediterranean 
countries by grinding sesame seeds with natural grape sugar. 

By-Products. Sesame oilcake is the only by-product in the prepara- 
tion of sesame oil. The cake is used in stock feeding.

A concrete fixed oil obtained from the roasted seeds of Theobroma 
Cacao Linne (Fam. Sterculiaceae) . It is said that Linnaeus was so 
fond of cacao that he gave to the tree the generic name of Theobroma 
Food of the Gods. Cacao trees grow wild to the height of 40 feet, 
but when cultivated they are generally trimmed to 15 or 20 feet. 
Theobroma cacao is grown in Mexico, Brazil, Bolivia, British West 
Indies, Cuba, Haiti, Peru, Venezuela, Ceylon, Colombia, and in fact 
in nearly all parts of South America and Central America.

acids, but it does not contain arachidic acid as claimed by some 
investigators. 

Preparation and Yield. The cacao fruit grows directly from the 
stem or branches and is from 9 to 12 inches long and about the shape 
of a cucumber. The fruit contains from twenty-five to fifty or more 
seeds imbedded in rows in a spongy mass. The seeds are cleaned and 
dried in the sun. In some cases the seeds are removed from their 
pods, and sweated by wrapping them in green leaves, and placing in a 
closed room, where slow fermentation takes place. This removes the 
bitter taste. The beans are then spread on trays, covered with red mud, 
and left for a day, when they are rubbed through the hands or trodden 
under the bare feet to remove gummy matter. 

On a large scale, the seeds, or beans as they are called, are roasted 
and ground or crushed and the fat is then removed by hydraulic 
pressure. 

The seeds yield 36.8 to 54.4 per cent, of fat. 1 

Properties and Tests. Oil of theobroma is a yellowish-white solid, 
having a faint, agreeable odor and a bland, chocolate-like taste. 
Soluble in boiling, dehydrated alcohol, freely soluble in ether, chloro- 
form and benzine. Slightly soluble in alcohol. 

Bjbrklund's Test for the detection of tallow, stearin and wax is 
given in the United States Pharmacopoeia as follows: 

Dissolve one gram of oil of theobroma in 3 cc. of ether in a test 
tube at a temperature of 17 C., and immerse the tube in water having 
the temperature of melting ice. The liquid does not become turbid 
nor deposit white flakes in less than three minutes; and if the mixture, 
after congealing, is again brought to 15 C. it gradually forms a per- 
fectly clear liquid. 

Cacao butter has been adulterated with cocoanut oil, which lowers 
the iodine number; tallow and sesame oil, which increase the iodine 
number. Sesame oil would also be detected by the Baudouin test. 

A commercial substitute for cacao butter has been sold under the 
name of " vegetable butter," and consists of 70 to 75 per cent, of 
cocoanut oil and 25 to 30 per cent, of Japan wax. 2 

Uses. Cacao butter is extensively used in making suppositories. 
It is used as an excipient in preparing pills that are easily decomposed, 
such as silver nitrate, potassium permanganate and phosphorus. 

By-Products. Although cacao butter is really a by-product in the 
preparation of cocoa and cocoa products, it has been treated as the 
principal so as to include it in the regular order of the official oils, 
and next will be considered what are really the chief products of 
Theobroma Cacao.

122 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Cocoa and Cocoa Products. The Federal Standards 1 for above products are 
as follows: 1. Cocoa beans are the seeds of the cacao tree, Theobroma cacao L.; 2. Cocoa 
nibs, cracked cocoa, is the roasted, broken cocoa bean free from its shell or husk; 3. 
Chocolate, plain chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, bitter chocolate coatings, is the 
solid or plastic ma,ss obtained by grinding cocoa nibs without the removal of fat or 
other constituents except the germ, and contains not more than three (3) per cent, 
ash insoluble in water, three and fifty one-hundredths (3.50) per cent, of crude fiber, 
and nine (9) per cent, of starch, and not more than forty-five (45) per cent, of cocoa 
fat. 

4. Sweet chocolate, sweet chocolate coatings, is chocolate mixed with sugar (su- 
crose), with or without the addition of cocoa butter, spices or other flavoring materials, 
and contains in the sugar- and fat-free residue no higher percentage of either ash, 
fiber or starch than is found in the sugar- and fat-free residue of chocolate. 

5. Cocoa, powdered cocoa, is cocoa nibs, with or without the germ, deprived of a 
portion of its fat and finely pulverized, and contains percentages of ash, crude fiber 
and starch corresponding to those in chocolate after correction for fat removed. 

6. Sweet cocoa, sweetened cocoa, is cocoa mixed with sugar (sucrose), con- 
taining not more than sixty (60) per cent, of sugar (sucrose), and in the sugar- and 
fat-free residue no higher percentage of either ash, crude fiber, or starch than is 
found in the sugar- and fat-free residue of chocolate. 

The United States Board of Food and Drug Inspection issued June 3, 1911, the 
following decision (FJ.D. 136) in reference to labeling of chocolate and cocoa: 

Milk chocolate and milk cocoa, in the opinion of the Board, should contain not 
less than 12 per cent, of milk solids, and the so-called nut chocolates should contain 
substantial quantities of nuts. If sugar is added, for example, to milk chocolate, 
it should be labeled "Sweet Milk Chocolate," "Sweet Nut Chocolate," etc. 

When cocoa is treated with an alkali or an alkaline salt, as in the so-called Dutch 
process, and the finished cocoa contains increased mineral matter as the result of 
this treatment, but no alkali as such is present, the label should bear a statement to 
the effect that the cocoa contains added mineral ingredients, stating the amount. 
Cocoas and chocolates containing an appreciable amount of free alkali are adulterated. 
In the opinion of the Board, cocoa not treated with alkali is not soluble in the or 
dinary acceptance of the term. Cocoa before and after treatment with alkali shows 
essentially the same lack of solubility. To designate the alkali-treated cocoa as 
"soluble" cocoa is misleading and deceptive. 

Booth 2 calls attention to the fact that England has not established 
a standard for chocolate, and suggests the following: 

(1) Unsweetened chocolate must be prepared exclusively from roasted, shelled, 
finely ground cocoa beans, with or without the addition of a small quantity of flavoring 
matter, and should not contain less than 45 per cent, of cocoa butter. 

(2) Sweetened chocolate a preparation consisting exclusively of the products of 
roasted, shelled, finely-ground cocoa beans, and not more than 65 per cent, of sugar, 
with or without a small quantity of harmless flavoring matter. 

(3) Granulated, or ground chocolate, for drinking purposes. The same definition 
as for sweetened chocolate should apply here, except that the proportion of sugar 
may be raised to not more than 75 per cent. 

(4) Chocolate covered goods. Various forms of confectionery covered with choc- 
olate; the composition of the latter agreeing with the definition of sweetened chocolate.

OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 123 

(5) Milk chocolate. A preparation composed exclusively of roasted, shelled cocoa 
beans, sugar and not less than 15 per cent, of the dry solids of full-cream milk, with 
or without a small quantity of harmless flavoring matter. 

The addition of starch other than that naturally present in the cocoa bean, of 
fat other than that naturally in the cocoa bean, and of cocoa shell in powder form, 
should be absolutely excluded from any article which is to be sold under the name of 
"Chocolate." 

Muter 1 divides prepared cocoas into two classes as follows: 

(1) That in which the reduction of the fat is secured by adding 
starch and sugar. 

(2) That where the fat is partially removed and the remainder of 
the bean is served the public unmixed. 

Muter condemns the former method of reducing the strength of 
cocoas. After making the analysis of a large number of samples 
he states that a fair average of constituents found in commercial 
cocoas is as follows : 

Fat 42.94 

Sugar and gum 6.40 

Starch 19.03 

Cocoa red, etc 3.69 

Cellulose 5.95 

Theobromine 90 

Gluten 12.21 

Ash 2.90 

Moisture 5.98 

100.00 

Stabilized Cacao. Reutter 2 states that by "Stabilization" is 
meant the prevention of fermentation in freshly gathered cacao 
beans. The pods were formerly allowed to undergo fermentation 
in order that the husk might be readily removed, but this fermenta- 
tion has considerable effect on the beans themselves. The pods 
may, however, be treated with a one per cent, soda solution at 45 C. 
The husk is then easily removed and the beans may be sterilized. The 
cacao thus obtained does not contain any preformed sugars these, 
together with theobromine and tannin, being products of hydrolysis. 
Theobromine does not occur in the free state in cacao, caffeine is 
absent, and only traces of ethereal oils are present. From the dilute 
methyl alcohol extract of defatted cacao there may be obtained a 
red-violet substance cacaorin having the formula CioH2oO 6 N 6 , and 
cacao red, of which the formula is C 4 oH 6 oNO27. On hydrolysis, cacao 
red yields a dextrorotatory sugar and an insoluble substance, cacao 
brown, having the formula C 7 6

124 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Analysis of cocoa products. 

In the main the methods as outlined by the Association of Official 
Agricultural Chemists 1 will be followed. 

Moisture. Dry two or three grams in a flat-bottomed, platinum 
dish, at the temperature of boiling water, for 10 hours; cool in a desic- 
cator and weigh; then dry again for an hour, or until practically a 
constant weight is obtained. 

Ash. Char the solids obtained from the determination of the 
moisture and burn until free from carbon at a low heat, not to exceed 
dull redness. If a carbon-free ash is not obtained in this manner, 
exhaust the charred mass with hot water, collect the insoluble residue 
on a filter, burn till the ash is white, or nearly so, and then add the 
filtrate to the ash and evaporate to dryness. Heat to a low redness, 
until the ash is white, or grayish-white, cool in a desiccator and weigh. 
The ash in unadulterated cocoa should run from 2.82 to 4.58 per cent. 

Alkalinity of Water-Soluble Ash. The ash, as obtained in the 
determination of the ash, is treated with boiling water, filtered through 
an ashless filter, and the washing with hot water continued until 
about 60 cc. of filtrate are obtained. Cool the filtrate and titrate 
with decinormal hydrochloric acid, using methyl orange as an in- 
dicator. 

Alkalinity of Water-Insoluble Ash. Ignite the filter paper and con- 
tents remaining from the determination of the water-soluble ash, and 
dissolve in an excess of decinormal hydrochloric acid (using generally 
ten cc.). Titrate the excess acid with decinormal sodium hydroxide, 
using methyl orange as an indicator. 

Express the alkalinity of the water-soluble and water-insoluble ash 
as the number of cc. of decinormal acid required to neutralize the ash 
from 1 gram of the sample. 

Leach 2 states in the manufacture of the so-called " soluble cocoas " 
alkali is added, which acts upon the fat and produces a more perfect 
emulsion. Such treatment is condemned if not actually considered an 
adulteration. 

The use of an alkali increases the percentage of ash as well as in- 
creases the alkalinity of ash. In pure, untreated cocoa ash the per- 
centage should generally be below 5.5 with an alkalinity of not to 
exceed 3.75, while with cocoas treated with alkali the ash is often 
as high as 8.5 per cent, with an alkalinity of 6 to 8. The alkalinity 
is the number of cc. of decinormal acid necessary to neutralize the ash 
from 1 gram of the sample.

OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 125 

Total Nitrogen. Determine according to general method given for 
the determination of nitrogen. 

Crude Fiber is determined according to the standard method for the 
determination of crude fiber. 

Starch. Weigh 4 grams of the sample, if unsweetened, or 10 grams 
if sweetened, into a small procelain mortar, add 25 cc. of ether and 
grind. After the coarser material has settled, decant the ether, 
together with the fine, suspended matter, onto a 11 cm. filter paper of 
sufficiently fine texture to retain the crude starch. After the ether 
has evaporated from the filter, transfer the fat-free residue to the 
mortar by means of a jet of cold water and rub to an even paste, 
filtering on the paper previously employed. Repeat this process until 
all the sugar is removed. In the case of sweetened products the 
filtrate should measure at least 500 cc. Heat the insoluble residue for 
2J hours with 200 cc. of water and 20 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 
1.125) in a flask provided with a reflux condenser. Cool and nearly 
neutralize with sodium hydroxide. Complete the volume to 250 cc., 
filter and determine the dextrose in an aliquot of the filtrate, as 
directed under lactose. The weight of dextrose obtained multiplied 
by 0.90 gives the weight of starch. 

By microscopical examination the addition of starch may be de- 
tected. Wheat and corn starch are used as adulterants in both 
cocoas and chocolates. McGill 1 found arrowroot starch in a number 
of samples of chocolate and cocoa. 

Revis and Burnett's 2 Method of Estimating Starch in Cocoa by Taka-Diastase. 
Five grams of fat-free dry cocoa matter are weighed out into a beaker and thoroughly 
stirred with 50 cc. of 10 per cent, alcohol (by volume), and filtered under pressure 
preferably in a large Buohner funnel as the process is thereby considerably hastened. 
The cocoa is then washed with two further quantities of 50 cc. of 10 per cent, alcohol 
and finally with 10 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol (by volume), taking care that at no 
stage the cocoa sucks dry, as it is then more difficult both to wash and to remove from 
the filter. This alcohol washing is very important, as otherwise great difficulties 
occur later on and erroneous results are obtained. The moist cocoa is then scraped 
and washed out of the funnel into a 250 cc. flask with about 125 cc. of boiling water, 
well mixed, and the flask placed in boiling water, with constant shaking, for fifteen 
minutes to gelatinize the starch. The contents of the flask are then cooled to 38 C. 
mixed with 0.05 grams of taka-diastase, rubbed up with a little water, 2 cc. of toluene 
added, and the flask after shaking and stoppering placed in an incubator at 38 C. 
for twenty-four to thirty-six hours, shaking at intervals. At the end of this period 
10 cc. of decinormal sodium hydroxide are added to stop the action; the flask is 
cooled to 15 C., about 100 cc. of water added, then 10 cc. of acid mercuric nitrate 
solution run in on the surface, and finally water to the mark below the toluene. The 
contents of the flask are then mixed and filtered. To 100 cc. of the filtrate (which 

1 Inland Revenue Dept., Ottawa, Can., Bui. No. 243.

126 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

should be perfectly colorless and bright), carefully measured into a flask, are added 
0.5 grams of sodium phosphate (NazHPOi.l2H 2 0). After this has dissolved 
10 cc. of sodium hydroxide solution are run in, the solution being agitated as this is 
done. The contents of the flask are mixed and filtered, and in the case of 5 grams of 
cocoa matter, 50 cc. are used for the gravimetric copper determination the polari- 
metric readings being also made on this filtrate. 

The solution of sodium hydroxide used above must be so adjusted that 10 cc. 
just neutralize 4 cc. of acid mercuric nitrate solution, and should on no account be in 
excess, it being preferable to leave the solution acid after the addition of the alkali. 
Generally a solution containing 55 grams caustic soda (97 per cent. NaOH) per liter 
will be of proper strength. 

The acid mercuric nitrate solution is prepared by dissolving pare mercuric oxide 
in twice its weight of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and diluting the resulting solution with 
five times its volume of water. 

By this method the authors proved the absence of starch in cacao 
shells. 

Revis and Burnett state that five samples of fat-free cocoa nibs 
were examined according to above method with the following results: 

Percentage of Starch in Fat-free Dry Nibs. 

Accra (Low grade cocoa) 12.8 

Guayaquil 8.0 

Trinidad 14.5 

Grenada 12.3 

San Thome 12.4 

Fat. Dry 2 grams of the material over sulphuric acid until all the 
moisture is practically removed. Drying by means of heat should 
be avoided, as products rich in fat show a tendency to cake at the 
temperature of boiling water. Extract with anhydrous ether in 
Knorr extracting apparatus, using a tared Sy flask, until no more 
fat is removed. Grind and repeat the extraction. Evaporate the 
ether and dry the residue to constant weight at 100 C. 

To prove the purity of the fat, the constants as given under cacao 
butter should be determined. 

Milk Fat in Milk Chocolate. Estimate the amount of milk fat in

Sucrose Welmans' Method of Determining Sugar in Chocolate. 1 

Ten grams of the finely divided chocolate are shaken in a separatory 
funnel with 100 cc. of water-saturated ether until all fat is dissolved. 
One hundred cc. of ether-saturated water are then added and the 
shaking continued for some time. When the separation has taken 
place the fat is determined in an aliquot portion of the ether layer. 
Fifty cc. of the aqueous layer are transferred to a 55 cc. flask, 2 cc. of 
lead acetate solution are added and water up to the mark. After 
filtering, the solution is polarized, and the amount of sugar calculated 
from the reading obtained. 

Sucrose and Lactose. Prepare the sample by chilling well and 
shaving as finely as possible with a knife. Transfer 26 grams of this 
material to an 8-ounce nursing bottle, add about 100 cc. of petroleum 
ether and shake for 5 minutes. Centrifugalize until the solvent is 
clear. Draw off the same by suction and repeat the treatment with 
petroleum ether. Place the bottle containing the defatted residue in 
a warm place until the residual traces of petroleum ether are prac- 
tically expelled. Add 100 cc. of water, shake until all the chocolate is 
loosened from the sides and bottom of the bottle, and then shake 3 
minutes longer. Add basic lead acetate solution from a burette to 
complete precipitation, then sufficient water to make the total volume 
of liquid 110 cc. Mix thoroughly and filter through a folded filter. 
Make the direct polariscopic reading "a" in a 200 mm. tube. Pre- 
cipitate the excess of lead by anhydrous potassium oxalate; filter; 
introduce 50 cc. of the lead-free filtrate into a 100 cc. flask and add 
25 cc. of water. Then add little by little, while rotating the flask, 5 
cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.20). Heat in a water bath kept at 
70 C. The temperature of the solution in the flask should read 67 
to 69 C. in 2J to 3 minutes. Maintain a temperature of nearly 69 C. 
for 7 to 7J minutes, making the total time of heating 10 minutes. 
Remove the flask and cool to the same temperature at which the direct 
polarization was made and add water to exactly 100 cc. Polarize and 
multiply the invert reading by 2 to correct for dilution (6). From

Casein in Milk Chocolate. It is unnecessary to de-fat the chocolate. 
Weigh 10 grams of chocolate into a 500 cc. Erlenmeyer flask and add 
250 cc. of 1 per cent, sodium oxalate solution. Heat to boiling and 
boil gently for a few minutes, then cool, add 5 grams of magnesium 
carbonate and filter. Determine the nitrogen in 50 cc. of this filtrate. 
Pipette 100 cc. of the filtrate into a 200 cc. volumetric flask and dilute 
almost to the mark with water. Then precipitate the casein by the 
addition of 2 cc. of glacial acetic acid or 1 cc. of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. Make to volume, shake, filter and determine nitrogen in 100 cc. 
of the filtrate. The difference between the two nitrogen determina- 
tions gives the nitrogen derived from the casein which, multiplied by 
6.38, gives the amount of casein present in 2 grams of the sample.

Determination of Cocoa Red. Lythgoe 1 gives the method of Ulrich 
and states that it does not possess material advantages over the de- 
termination of pentosans or of fiber for this purpose, but as the product 
determined is a constituent of the cocoa nibs and is absent in the shell, 
while the pentosans and fiber are constituents of the shells and not of 
the nibs, the determination may be of interest. The method is as 
follows : 

To 1 gram of fat-free, dry substance, which should be finely pow- 
dered, in a 300 cc. Erlenmeyer flask, add 120 cc. pure acetic acid (50 
to 51 per cent.); connect with a return-flow condenser and boil for 
three hours; cool and bring the contents of the flask to a volume of 
150 cc. with cold water; shake well and allow to stand at least 12 hours; 
filter through a dry filter and treat 135 cc. of the filtrate (corresponding 
to 0.9 grams of the original substance) with 5 cc. of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid and 20 cc. of a 20 per cent, ferric chloride solution. Con- 
nect with a return-flow condenser, heat to the boiling point and boil 
10 minutes; cool quickly and transfer to a beaker; after letting stand 
at least 6 hours, filter upon a weighed filter, washing the precipitate 
with hot water until free from iron; dry for 6 hours at 105 C. and 
weigh.

It is noticeable that Lythgoe reports about four times as much 
cocoa red as Muter (see page 123) in commercial samples of cocoa. 
It is more than likely due to different methods of analysis. 

The average results of analyses of six samples of milk chocolate as 
reported by Lythgoe 2 are as follows :

In the calculation of the composition of the milk used, the proteins 
were estimated by multiplying the per cent, of casein by the factor 
1.25. The average of milk sugar in unadulterated milk is assumed to 
be 4.8 per cent, and ash 0.75 per cent. The per cent, of protein in the 
original milk would be calculated thus :

X = 3.32, the per cent, (average) of proteins in milk. 

By-Products Cocoa Butter is considered a by-product in the manu- 
facture of cocoas. 

Cocoa Husks are roasted and used as cattle food. They are also 
used in the preparation of a cheap beverage. Treated after the 
manner of tea they yield an extract of a bitter flavor, which is used as 
a substitute for coffee or chocolate. According to the analysis made 
by Paris 1 the percentage composition of the roasted husk is as follows : 

Water 12.57 

Nitrogenous matter 14.69 

Fat 3.30 

Non-nitrogenous extract 45.76 

Crude fiber 16.33 

Ash 7.35 

Cocoas are quite frequently adulterated by the addition of cocoa 
husks or shells according to Notices of Judgment published by the 
Government. 

An example where the ash is excessively high in a cocoa owing to 
the addition of mineral matter, may be illustrated by the analysis 
given below, which is taken from Notice of Judgment 2980 U. S. 
Department of Agriculture : 

Moisture (per cent.) 2.60

Theobromine CyHgC^N^ an alkaloid, is found in cacao beans to the 
extent of 1 to 2 per cent. The beans also contain a small amount of 
caffeine. 

Dekker's Method for the determination of the total alkaloids in 
cacao beans as given by Henry 1 is as follows : Ten grams of powdered 
cocoa beans are mixed with 5. grams of magnesia and boiled under a 
reflux apparatus during one hour with 300 cc. of water. The decoction 
is filtered off; the residue again boiled with water during 15 minutes, 
and the second decoction filtered. The combined filtrates are evap- 
orated to dryness on the water bath, the residue mixed with sand and 
extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with chloroform. The solvent is 
distilled off and the residue dried and weighed. The total alkaloids in 
cocoa beans is 1.2 to 2.2 and in the husks about 0.5 per cent. 

In order to obtain the percentage of theobromine and caffeine 
separately, Maupy's Method should be used to obtain the amount of 
theobromine, and by deducting the pure theobromine thus obtained 
from the mixed alkaloids, as determined by Dekker's Method, the 
amount of caffeine will be obtained. 

Maupy's Method 2 of Estimating the Theobromine in Cocoa and 
Chocolate, (a) Cocoa. Five grams of cocoa, from which the fat 
has been extracted with petroleum spirit, are triturated with 2 cc. of 
water and then boiled under a reflux condenser for an hour with a 
mixture of 15 grams of phenol and 85 cc. of chloroform. Cool and

filter; macerate the residue for 30 minutes twice with 15 cc. of chloro- 
form; separate the chloroform each time and add to the original filtered 
solution. Evaporate the chloroform extracts and add 40 cc. of ether 
to the residue and let stand for six hours. The theobromine is pre- 
cipitated, while the caffeine, coloring matter and traces of fat remain 
in solution. Collect the precipitate on a weighed filter, wash several 
times with ether to remove phenol, dry and weigh. 

(6) Chocolate. Ten grams are finely powdered and the fat ex- 
tracted with petroleum ether. The residue is mixed with 4 cc. of 70 
per cent, alcohol and the estimation continued the same as if using 
5 grams of cocoa. 

The assay of roasted cocoas by this method gave the following 
percentage of theobromine : 

Trinidad 1.44 

Caracas 1.38 

Para 1.28 

Grenada 1.60 

Martinique 1.52 

The same author obtained 0.54 per cent, theobromine from a choco- 
late which contained 60 per cent, of sugar. 

Adulterations of Cocoa Products. Onfray 1 states that by the addi- 
tion of 5 per cent, of gelatin to chocolate it is possible to introduce at 
least 10 per cent, of water without altering the appearance of the same. 
A sample of chocolate adulterated with gelatin gave upon analysis 
the following results : 

Ash 2.72 

Sugar 46.17 

Fat 14.24 

Water 12.20 

The average of 5 samples of chocolate manufactured by reliable 
makers gave the following: 

Ash 1.56 

Sugar 61.68 

Fat 20.53 

Water 2.50 

Test for Gelatin. Five grams of the suspected chocolate are treated 
with 50 cc. of boiling water and 5 cc. of a 10 per cent, solution of lead 
acetate. Filter and add several drops of a saturated aqueous solution 
of picric acid to the filtrate. A yellow precipitate is obtained in case 
gelatin is present in a notable quantity.

Cocoa Powders. From 2 to 3 grams of the sample is shaken with 
about 10 cc. of absolute alcohol. With pure cocoa the alcohol re- 
mains colorless, or is colored only a faint yellow. The solution gives a 
white precipitate with sodium hydroxide, and no color reaction with 
ferric chloride. The filtered alcoholic extract from sanders wood, or 
cocoa mixed with same, is, on the other hand, colored and gives with 
dilute sodium hydroxide solution an intense violet coloration.

Principal Components. Schlippe 1 found croton oil to contain a 
resin-like, blistering substance, crotonol CgHwC^; stearic, palmitic, 
laurinic, myristic and oleic acids; a volatile crotonic acid, also, butyric, 
valerianic and tiglinic acids. Dunstan and Boole 2 states the vesicating 
constituent of croton oil is croto-oleic acid. 

Preparation and Yield. The seeds contain from 53 to 56 per cent, 
of oil. The seeds are crushed and the oil obtained by pressing same. 
Zinnel 3 obtained from seeds that were beaten to a paste, 33.32 per 
cent, of oil when extracted with benzin; 22.9 per cent, with chloroform, 
and 33.7 per cent, with carbon disulphide. Only the expressed oil is 
official. 

Properties and Tests. Croton oil is a pale yellow, or brownish- 
yellow, somewhat viscid and slightly fluorescent liquid, having a 
slight characteristic odor; soluble in ether, chloroform, fixed and 
volatile oils; slightly soluble in alcohol. The solubility increases with 
age. 

When gently heated with twice its volume of dehydrated alcohol, 
it forms a clear solution from which the croton oil separates either 
partially or completely on cooling. 

Elaidin is not formed when the oil is treated with nitrous acid. 

If adulterated with castor oil, or almost any fixed oil, it would be 
detected by its lowering the polarization and the Reichert-Meissl value. 

Use. It is used in medicine for its purgative and vesicating prop- 
erties.

Principal Components. Hehner and Mitchell 4 found from 6.07 to 
16.11 per cent, of stearic acid in the fatty acids of commercial lards 
and 8.59 to 15.7 per cent, in fat taken from a pig six months old. The 
lower percentage was taken from the back fat and the larger percentage 
from the fat from the flare. Hehner 5 reports one case as high as 24.91 
per cent, of stearic acid. Kries and Hafner 6 report that lard crystals 
contain a mixed glyceride heptadecyldistearin, while Bonier 7 claims 
that the glyceride in lard is palmitodistearin and not heptadecyldi- 
stearin. He also reports a second saturated glyceride, namely, 
stearodipalmitin. 

In addition to the above components, Lewkowitsch 8 reports glyc- 
erides of lauric, myristic and oleic acids and small quantities of linolic 
acid (and perhaps also linolenic acid). 

Preparation. Under Standards of Purity of Food Products, 9 Lard, 
Leaf Lard, and Neutral Lard are defined as follows : 

Lard is the rendered fresh fat from hogs in good health at the time 
of slaughter; is clean, free from rancidity, and contains, necessarily 
incorporated in the process of rendering, not more than one (1) per 
cent, of substances other than fatty acids and fat. 

Leaf Lard is lard rendered at moderately high temperatures from 
the internal fat of the abdomen of the hog, excluding that adherent 
to the intestines, and has an iodine value not greater than sixty (60) .

steam-jacketed open kettles from the leaf fat together with the fat 
cut from the back of the animal. 

Prime Steam Lard as defined by the Chicago Board of Trade: 

"Standard prime steam lard shall be solely the product of the trimmings and other 
fat parts of hogs, rendered in tanks by the direct application of steam and without 
subsequent change in grain or character by the use of agitators or other machinery 
except as such change may unavoidably come from transportation. It shall have 
proper color, flavor and soundness for keeping, and no material which has been salted 
shall be included. The name and location of the Tenderer and the grade of the lard 
shall be plainly branded on each package at the time of packing." 

Leaf lard prepared from leaf fat is practically an article unknown in 
commerce. What is sold as pure leaf lard is generally rendered from 
trimmings made in cutting the pork for packing and the fat adherent 
to the intestines, and is rendered either in closed steam tanks or open 
steam jacketed kettles. The latter method gives better lard as it 
permits the evaporation of water. 

Lard rendered from trimmings contains more or less blood-stained 
fat, hair, lean meat and connective tissue, which is nitrogenous and 
scorches readily. It has to be whitened, and the general practice is 
to use sodium carbonate, milk of lime, or Fuller's earth as a clarifying 
agent. 

Lard rendered in closed tanks contains a considerable amount of 
water and is cooled in an agitator in order to keep the water incor- 
porated with the fat. In case sodium carbonate, milk of lime, water 
or similar additions have been made the melted lard will be more or 
less opaque, while pure lard when melted forms a perfectly clear 
liquid. 

Properties and Tests. In addition to the determination of the 
constants of lard, a number of special tests have been proposed and 
a brief reference to a number of them is deemed advisable. 

Beef fat appears to take the lead as an adulterant for lard, and at the 
same time the methods of detecting same are none too satisfactory. 

Free Fatty Acids. Pure lard contains very little free fatty acids, 
but in rancid lard a considerable amount is present. The amount 
permissible is generally expressed by the number of cc. of decinormal 
potassium hydroxide necessary to neutralize 100 grams of lard, which 
should not exceed 20 (or not over 0.56 per cent., calculated as oleic 
acid) using phenolphthalein as indicator. The neutralization is

138 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

accomplished by dissolving 10 grams of lard in 30 cc. of chloroform 
and adding the mixture to 10 cc. of neutral alcohol, and then titrating 
with tenth-normal potassium hydroxide. 

Lard seldom contains appreciable amounts of water, but this can 
be determined by drying a weighed portion (about 5 grams) at a 
temperature of 100 C. 

Belfield, 1 in 1883, announced a method of determining the admix- 
ture of tallow with lard by dissolving in a volatile liquid, such as 
ether, and allowing to crystallize, when characteristic crystals of the 
respective fats are formed. Belfield gives the credit of the discovery 
to Rose and Danforth, but the test is generally recognized as the 
Belfield Test. 

Belfield claims to have been able to detect as low as 5 per cent, of 
tallow when mixed with lard. This test was made official in the U.S. P. 
IX and is applied as follows: Dissolve 5 grams of lard in 20 cc. of 
ether in a test tube, stopper the tube loosely with purified cotton and 
allow it to stand about twelve hours, or over night, at a temperature 
of about 20 C. Collect some of the crystals which have separated 
at the bottom of the test tube, mount them either in alcohol or a 
fixed oil and examine them under a microscope having a magnifying 
power of about two hundred diameters. Lard stearin crystallizes 
in the form of flat and rhomboidal plates, cut off obliquely at one end 
and grouped irregularly; beef stearin crystallizes in the form of 
cylindrical rods or needles, with sharp ends, grouped in fan-shaped 
clusters. 

Belfield describes the crystals as thin rhomboidal plates, whose 
obtuse angles measure about 105 degrees. Sometimes these plates 
are arranged in rosettes, though this does not seem to be a necessary 
part of the arrangement. Pure tallow crystals will be found, not as 
rhomboidal plates, but in curved forms, resembling in shape the 
italic letter "/." These crystals often appear singly and are also 
found grouped together so as to make a mass which may be roughly 
compared to a sheaf of wheat; at other times these masses have the 
same curved shape as the individual crystals, but seem constricted 
near the middle. 

Stock 2 proposed to modify Belfield 's test by adopting a fixed ether 
volume, seven times greater than the volume of melted fat, and lower- 
ing the temperature slowly to 13 C. and keeping it at that temperature 
for 24 hours. Beef stearin begins to separate from the ethereal solu- 
tion at 17 C. and lard stearin at 14 C., and Stock selected 13 C. as 
it was a guarantee of the deposition of any beef stearin which might

OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 139 

be present. After standing in a glass-stoppered tube, at a tempera- 
ture of 13 C. for twenty-four hours, the ether is poured off and ten cc. 
of fresh ether at 13 C. is added. The deposit is well shaken and 
allowed to settle. This is repeated and then the contents of the tube 
is transferred to a weighed, shallow beaker. The ether is run off, and 
the deposit dried at 40 C., ten to fifteen minutes, cooled and weighed. 
Standards are run at the same time and by proper calculation, Stock 
claims to be able to detect as low as 5 per cent, of tallow mixed with 
lard. For confirmatory test for beef fat, the crystals deposited at 
13 C. are examined microscopically, the same as if the operation had 
been carried on according to the Belfield test. 

Dunlop, 1 after studying the different methods for detecting beef 
fat in lard, concludes as follows : 

1. That it is necessary to employ a much higher power than 100 
diameters when examining the crystals from a suspected sample of 
lard, as the appearance of "plumose" groups, alone, at the above 
power, without regard to the form of the individual crystals at a 
higher magnification, is no proof of the presence of beef stearin. 

2. That as the "stearin" obtained from beef fat by a single crystal- 
lization is more soluble in ether than the "stearin" from first crystal- 
lization of lard, it is useless to attempt to eliminate lard "stearin" 
from a mixture of the two by recrystallization, as recommended by 
Keating Stock. 

3. That as the weight of the ether-washed deposit (Keating Stock's 
method) from genuine lard varies, as has been shown, from 5 to nearly 
200 mgs., it is dangerous to draw conclusions, either quantitative or 
qualitative, from such a test. 

Hehner 2 states that when cottonseed or other vegetable oil can be 
traced, and the iodine absorption is high, the "beef form" of crystals 
may be taken to afford evidence of the presence of beef or mutton 
fats. In the absence of vegetable oil, and with a low iodine absorp- 
tion, the Belfield test can at most afford some reason for suspicion, but 
no trustworthy evidence of adulteration. 

The Polenske Method 3 is based on the fact that the difference 
between the melting and solidifying points varies with different fats, 
but is practically constant for one and the same kind of fat. In case 
of lard, the difference is not less than 19 C. between its melting and 
solidifying points, and samples exhibiting a less difference than 18.5 
C. are considered as containing other animal fat.

140 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Emery 1 proposed to detect beef fat in admixture with lard by the 
difference in the melting point of the solid glycerides crystallized 
under certain conditions. The melting point of glycerides obtained 
from lard should not be below 63.4 or beef fat would be indicated. 

Emery's Method 2 of detecting beef fat in lard: Weigh 5 grams of 
the melted fat into a glass stoppered, 25 cc. cylinder, about 150-175 
mm. in height: add warm ether up to 25 cc. mark; stopper securely, 
and shake until the fat is completely dissolved. Allow the cylinder 
to stand for about 18 hours at a temperature of 16 to 20 C., during 
which time some of the solid glycerides will crystallize out. Decant 
the clear solution carefully from the crystals, wash with three 5 cc, 
portions of cold ether, avoiding breaking up the deposit during the 
first two washings. Agitate the crystals with a third portion of ether 
and transfer to a small filter. Wash on the paper with successive 
small amounts of cold ether until 15 to 20 cc. have been used; then 
remove the last traces of ether by means of slight suction on the stem 
of the funnel. Break up any large lumps and allow the deposit to 
dry. 

When thoroughly dried, pulverize the glycerides and take their 
melting point in a closed 1 mm. tube. Heat the water in the beaker 
rapidly to about 55 C. and maintain that temperature until the 
thermometer carrying the melting-point tube registers 50 to 55 C. 
Then heat again and carry the temperature of the outer bath some- 
what rapidly to 67 C., when the flame is removed. The melting 
point of the crystals is regarded as that point when the fused substance 
becomes perfectly clear and transparent. A dark background placed 
about 4 inches from the apparatus will prove of advantage. When the 
melting point of glycerides obtained by this method is below 63.4 C. 
the presence of beef fat should be suspected, while a melting point 
of 63 C., or below, can be regarded as positive evidence that the 
sample is not pure lard. It is advisable to carry out this method with 
a control sample of lard in connection with each batch of samples 
analyzed. 

A small amount of beef stearin is often added to lard to prevent its 
becoming soft in warm weather. Some packers accomplish the same 
results by pressing out a sufficient quantity of olein to make the 
stearin and palmitin stand stiff in warm weather. This practice is an 
adulteration as the olein is a very desirable constituent of lard. 

The most frequent adulterations of lard are the removal of olein 
and substitution of cottonseed oil, or simply the addition of beef

tallow. Cottonseed oil would be detected by the Halphen test and 
beef tallow by the Belfield or Emery test, as given above. 

Crook's 1 Method for detecting heated cottonseed oil in lard is as 
follows : 

Place about 10 grains of the sample to be examined in a cup-shaped 
porcelain capsule of about an ounce capacity. A small disc of white 
filter paper (which has been soaked in hydrochloric acid, washed in 
distilled water, and dried) is just moistened with a 12 per cent, solution 
of nitrate of silver and placed in the concave part of a watch glass, 
which, with the paper downward, is then inverted over the capsule 
containing the sample. The capsule is then put in a shallow oil bath, 
to which heat is gently applied until a thermometer in the bath reaches 
240 F., when the source of heat is immediately withdrawn. If even 
less than one per cent, of heated cottonseed oil be present in the sample, 
a very marked coloration takes place on the disc, varying from a 
light brown to nearly black. 

Kerr 2 proposes the determination of phytosterol for the detection of 
vegetable oils, such as cottonseed oil, in lard. He states as to the 
choice between the digitonin and the alcoholic extraction methods, 
that both led to uniformly correct conclusions. "The digitonin 
method offers the advantage of simplicity and convenience and has the 
disadvantage of demanding an expensive reagent, which also is limited 
in supply, and obtainable only with difficulty." 

Of 945 samples of lard reported by McGill 3 there were only 22 re- 
ported as adulterated and a few doubtful. Those adulterated con- 
tained added beef fat or cottonseed oil. In addition to the above, a 
few samples contained an excess of water, that is, from 1.47 to 3.45 
per cent. One per cent, of water was considered permissible. 

Shrewsbury 4 and Dunlop 5 give methods for the detection of paraffin 
in lard. Dunlop gives Holde's test which is as follows: From 0.3 to 
0.35 grams (10 drops) of the melted fat is saponified in a test tube with 
15 cc. of approximately N/2 alcoholic potassium hydroxide, and to 
the clear, hot soap solution, water is added in successive quantities of 
about 1 cc. the solution being carefully observed after each addition 
of water. Pure lard gives a clear solution of soap after dilution with 
5 cc. of water; the presence of even 0.5 per cent, of paraffin is indicated 
by the formation of turbidity, the " silky" appearance of which is 
characteristic of paraffin.

Uses. Lard is largely used in the U.S. P. preparations. 

It is unnecessary to mention the extensive use of lard for culinary 
purposes. 

By-Products. The only by-product in the preparation of lard is 
the cracklings, and it has been proposed by Albright 1 to use same in 
bread making. 

From kettle-rendered lard there remains an average of 3.2 per cent, 
of cracklings, and the cracklings contain close to 5 per cent, of lard.

Animal Flour. This is the name suggested by Albright for the 
cracklings as used in bread making. He found 6 per cent, of fat and 
87.2 per cent, of protein in a sample. In bread making one pound of 
animal flour is to be mixed with five pounds of wheat flour. The 
bread is claimed to be very palatable and contains double the nutri- 
ment that there is in bread made with wheat flour alone. 

Unguentum Hydrargyri, U. S. P. 

Mercurial ointment is a mixture of mercury, oleate of mercury, pre- 
pared suet and benzoated lard. The official method of analysis is as 
follows: Weigh 10 grams of Mercurial Ointment in a tared dish, melt it, 
then remove it from the fire and add 50 cc. of warm purified petroleum 
benzin. Stir the mixture well, allow the mercury to settle completely, 
and decant the benzin. Wash the residue with successive portions of 
10 cc. each of warm purified petroleum benzin until it is entirely free 
from fatty matter, carefully retaining all the separated mercury in 
the dish and allowing all traces of the benzin to evaporate. Add to 
the residue 10 cc. of diluted hydrochloric acid, heat it gently and stir 
with a glass rod until the mercury collects in a globule. Pour off the 
acid, warm the mercury with a little distilled water, dry the globule 
on bibulous paper, and weigh. The separated mercury weighs not 
less than 4.9 grams nor more than 5.1 grams. 

In case it should become necessary to examine the fat, dissolve it 
with ether and filter. Evaporate the ether and then the fat may be 
examined in the usual manner. 

Crewe 1 recommends the following method: About 20 grams of the 
ointment are weighed into a beaker having a capacity of 300 cc.; 10 
grams potassium hydroxide and about 100 cc. methylated spirit are 
added and the whole warmed on a water bath until the mercury col- 
lects in globules. Hot water is then added and the soap solution 
carefully decanted from the mercury, which is dried on a water bath 
before weighing. If the globule is not quite bright it should be 
treated with a little warm dilute hydrochloric acid to remove any 
impurities. 

The Leffmann and Beam method of saponifying fats may be used to 
advantage in the determination of mercury in mercurial ointment as 
follows : About 3 grams (weigh exactly) of the ointment is weighed into 
a 200 cc. tared beaker, 20 cc. glycerol-soda solution are added. The 
mixture is heated over a Bunsen burner to drive off the water and 
heating continued until complete saponification, which takes about 
five minutes. The mercury is then washed by adding hot water and

144 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

decanting. This is repeated several times until the soda solution is 
removed. It is then washed with alcohol and finally with ether. 
Dry at about 60 C. on a water bath for two or three minutes, cool and 
weigh. It is unnecessary to treat the mercury with dilute hydro- 
chloric acid as required by the U.S. P. method. 

The glycerol-soda solution should be prepared as given by Leffmann 
and Beam 1 as follows: 100 grams of pure sodium hydroxide are dis- 
solved in 100 cc. of distilled water and allowed to stand until clear. 
Twenty cc. of this solution are mixed with 180 cc. of pure concentrated 
glycerol.

Adulterants such as cottonseed oil and mineral oils should be looked 
for. For cottonseed oil, apply Halphen test. Mineral oils would be 
detected by saponification. 

Uses. Lard oil is used mostly as a lubricant and for burning, and 
to some extent as an adulterant for more expensive oils. 

By-Products. Lard stearin is used in compound lard and in the 
manufacture of oleomargarine.

Principal Components. Lanolin consists essentially of the esters of 
various acids with cholesterin the esters being true waxes, and not 
glycerides. 

Richter 1 states that lanolin consists of the esters of cholesterol and 
isocholesterol, with the higher fatty acids. From a mixture of soaps, 
produced by the saponification of lanolin, there has been isolated 
lanoceric acid, lanopalmitic acid, myristic acid and carnaubic acid. 

Preparation and Yield. It has been proposed to dissolve the fat 
from the wool by use of solvents, but this method has not proven 
satisfactory, owing to the damage done to the wool fiber in freeing 
it from the solvents after the fat has been removed. It is now prepared 
from the wash water of woolen factories by acidulating the water with 
dilute sulphuric acid of about 0.4 per cent, strength. The crude 
wool grease is called " Degras" and is the source of the purified product 
called "Lanolin." 

The wool-fat contains a wax-like substance called wool-wax, and 
Jaffe and Darmstaedter 2 patented a method for the separation of 
wool-wax from wool-fat by using certain solvents, such as benzene, 
toluene, xylene, ether, chloroform, bisulphide of carbon or turpentine 
oil. To the solution is added methyl or ethyl alcohol which precipi- 
tates the harder substances of wool-fat. The solvents being separated 
from the precipitate (which is used as a substitute for bees-wax) are 
recovered by distillation and the residue contains the softer portion, 
or lanolin. 

Fialkowski 3 recommends soaking sheep's wool in cold water for 
24 hours, and then washing it until the water remains clear. The

wool is then boiled twice with water and pressed while hot, when the 
lanolin will be obtained of a whitish color. The wool yields about 
11 per cent, of lanolin. The yield, as given by Lewkowitsch, varies. 
Russian wool yielded 6.6 per cent. South American wool 13.2 per cent. 
Australian wool 16.0 per cent, and New Zealand wool 16.0 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Wool fat is a light yellow, tenacious, unc- 
tuous mass, having not more than a slight odor; insoluble in, but 
miscible with about twice its weight of alcohol; freely soluble in ether 
and chloroform (1 in 50); when poured upon the surface of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid, it gradually develops a deep, brownish-red 
color at the line of contact of the layers. U.S. P. 

Lanolin should not contain chlorides, alkalies or glycerides. 

Lanolin may be identified by adding 1.5 to 2.0 grams of potassium 
hydroxide to 0.1 gram of lanolin which has been placed in a porcelain 
dish and kept melted for a short time. Dissolve, after cooling, in 
5 cc. of water and shake with 5 cc. of chloroform. The chloroform 
solution is then carefully poured on sulphuric acid in a test tube. At 
the point of contact of these two layers, the characteristic deep red 
color of cholesterin appears. 1 This is practically the U.S. P. test 
differently applied. 

Tellera 2 proposes the following test for the detection of paraffins in 
lanolin : One gram of the sample is dissolved in ether, and the stearin, 
which separates on cooling the mixture, is removed by filtration. 
Add 5 cc. absolute alcohol to the filtrate. If the lanolin contains 3 
to 4 per cent, of petrolatum products a precipitate is formed immedi- 
ately, while if only one per cent, is present the precipitate forms in 
about 30 minutes. Crude lanolin gives a slight turbidity on the addi- 
tion of the alcohol, but purified lanolin gives a clear solution. 

Braun's Method of Estimating Lanolin in Soaps 3 is as follows : Ten 
grams of the soap is dissolved in water and the solution treated with 
concentrated calcium chloride solution. The precipitate is collected 
on a filter, dried at 60 C. and extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain 
the lanolin. 

Owing to the high price of lanolin a number of substitutes have been 
proposed, such as follows:

The purified fat of the wool of the sheep, combined with not less 
than 25 nor more than 30 per cent, of water. 

This should conform to all the tests of "Adeps Lanae" except as to 
the water content. 

Uses. Lanolin is used as an ointment base owing to its being 
readily absorbed by the skin. It is also used in the manufacture of 
toilet preparations such as creams and soaps. It is used in place of 
tallow in certain cylinder oils.

Principal Components. It consists of a mixture of glycerides of 
stearic, palmitic and oleic acids. 

Preparation. The crude fat is rendered by heating by direct fire or 
superheated steam, and separated the same as in the preparation of 
lard. 

Properties and Tests. A white, solid fat, nearly inodorous, and 
having a bland taste when fresh, but becoming rancid on prolonged 
exposure to the air. Insoluble in cold alcohol; dissolves in 44 parts of 
boiling alcohol, in about 60 parts of ether, and dissolves slowly in 
2 parts of purified petroleum benzin. It separates in crystalline form 
from the latter solvent on standing. U.S. P. 

Adulterations that might be present would be detected in the 
determination of the constants as given above. 

When the term " tallow," without qualification, is used, it is gener- 
ally in reference to rendered beef fat; however, it would equally apply 
to the fat of the sheep; but when the latter fat is desired it is customary 
to use the term "mutton tallow." 

Uses. Mutton tallow is used in candle a,nd soap making and as a 
lubricant. It is used in the preparation of the official mercurial 
ointment. 

By-Products. The roasted tissues are termed " graves" and are 
used for poultry food and for feeding pigs, while the tissues from the 
steam method are utilized in making ammonia and glue.

Principal Components. Yellow wax consists of about 12 to 14 per 
cent, cerotic acid and 86 to 88 per cent, myricin, or myricyl palmitate. 

Preparation. The honeycombs are melted in hot water; the sugar 
being dissolved and the wax rising to the surface is skimmed off. 
The wax thus obtained should be remelted and strained. A method 
of extracting and straining the wax in one operation is to place the 
honeycombs in a kettle of water. A hoop that will fit into the kettle 
is covered with cheesecloth and fastened into the kettle below the 



152 PHARMACEUTICAL -AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

level of the surface of the water. When heat is applied the wax is 
melted and rises through the cheese cloth to the surface of the water 
and is perfectly clean. 

Many chemical methods have been proposed for bleaching yellow 
wax, but for the most part they have proven unsuccessful, as the 
chemicals used destroy the desirable qualities of the wax. The better 
grades of white wax are produced by rolling yellow wax in very thin 
sheets and exposing it to the light and sun until bleached. 

Properties and Tests. White wax is a yellowish-white solid, some- 
what translucent in thin layers, having a faint, characteristic odor; 
it is free from rancidity, and nearly tasteless. Yellow wax is a yellow 
to gray-brown solid, having an agreeable, honey-like odor, and a 
faint, characteristic taste. U.S. P. It is slightly soluble in alcohol, 
and is soluble in chloroform, ether, fixed and volatile oils. 

In 1883, Hehner 1 published methods, originally proposed by Hiibl, 
of analysis of beeswax by the determination of the acid and ester values. 
He calculated the acid as cerotic acid and based the ester value on the 
amount of myricin, or myricyl palmitate, present. In English wax 
the proportion of myricin to cerotic acid is 6.117 : 1. 

With slight changes, the official method of determining these factors 
is the same as proposed by Hehner. The U.S. P. method is as follows : 

Warm about 3 grams of yellow wax, accurately weighed, in a 200 cc. flask with 
25 cc. of neutral dehydrated alcohol until melted; then add 1 cc. of phenolphthalein 
and titrate the mixture while warm with half-normal, alcoholic potassium hydroxide 
to a faint pink color. The acid value so obtained is not less than 18 nor more than 
24. Now add 25 cc. of half-normal, alcoholic potassium hydroxide and 50 cc. of 
alcohol, boil the mixture for two hours under a reflux condenser and titrate the ex- 
cess of the alkali with half-normal hydrochloric acid. The ester value so obtained is 
not less than 72 nor more than 77. 

The specific gravity of both the white and the yellow wax is ob- 
tained by the " flotation" method. 

Adulterants occurring in beeswax, as reported by Kebler and Boyles, 2 
are paraffin, ceresin, resin and stearic acid paraffin being used most 
frequently. Their method for the detection and estimation of paraffin 
is as follows: 

Melt from 2 to 5 grams of wax in a porcelain dish, then add an 
equal weight of finely powdered potassium hydroxide, and continue 
heating for a few moments with thorough stirring. Cool and powder 
the hard mass, and mix the resulting powder with three times as much 
potash lime as wax used; then introduce this mixture into a thick-

walled tube, immerse in an oil bath and heat to about 250 C. for 
from three to four hours. After cooling, finely powder the tube and 
its contents, place the mass in a Soxhlet apparatus, and extract with 
petroleum ether for several hours. The petroleum ether is evaporated 
and the residue dried at 110 C. and weighed. By this treatment 
the esters are converted into alcohols, and these alcohols on heating 
with potash lime are in turn converted into their respective acids, 
while the hydrocarbons present are not affected and are extracted with 
petroleum ether. Pure beeswax contains from 12.5 to 14 per cent, 
hydrocarbons, and any adulteration with paraffin, ceresin, or allied 
bodies will increase this percentage. 

Salamon and Seaber 1 state that in pure beeswax the temperature 
at which cloudiness appears in a hot, saponified, alcoholic solution is 
practically constant. In pure European waxes the cloudiness ap- 
pears at 59.5 C. to 60.5 C. and in East India waxes at 56 C. to 57 C.; 
if 5 per cent, of paraffin is added the temperature at which cloudiness 
appears is raised in European waxes 3 to 4 C. and if 10 % paraffin 
is added the rise will be 14 to 15 C. The same holds true for East 
India waxes. The test is applied as follows: One gram of wax is 
saponified over the flame for one hour with 10 cc. of N/2 alcoholic 
potash and 10 cc. of alcohol. The flask is taken off the flame and a 
thermometer inserted. Stir the liquid and at a certain temperature it 
becomes cloudy. The temperature is read at this point. In case of 
pure waxes the cloudiness is followed by immediate precipitation of 
large flocks. 

The U.S. P. VIII directs the examination of beeswax for paraffin as 
follows : 

Five grams of yellow wax are heated fifteen minutes in a flask with 25 cc. of sul- 
phuric acid. The mixture is then poured into a large excess of water. If a notable 
amount of substance separates, which cannot be decomposed upon further treatment 
with sulphuric acid, it would indicate paraffin. 

Donath's method for the determination of resin is given as follows : 2 
Keep at the boiling point for about one minute, a mixture of 5 grams 
of the wax and 20 to 25 cc. of nitric acid (specific gravity 1.32 to 1.33) ; 
dilute with an equal volume of water, and render slightly alkaline with 
ammonium hydroxide. The solution decanted from the separated 
wax, in the absence of resin, is a yellowish color, while the presence of 
resin produces a more or less intense reddish-brown coloration. 

A second method is given by Kebler and Boyles for the detection 
of resin in beeswax. It is a modification of the well-known Lieber-

mann-Storch method. Extract one gram of wax with warm, 
50 per cent, alcohol, which does not extract sfcearic acid if present; 
cool and filter; evaporate the filtrate to dryness on a water bath, and 
add 5 cc. of acetic anhydride. Heat to boiling and then allow sulphuric 
acid (sp. gr. 1.53) to flow into the solution. If resin is present, there 
will be developed a violet (fugitive) color.

Stearic Acid. Buchner 2 recommends Dottger's modification of 
Fehling's test as follows: Boil 1 gram of the wax with 10 cc. of alcohol 
and then cool to 18-20 C. Filter and treat the filtrate with water. 
Stearic acid separates in flocks and collects on the surface of the liquid. 
As low as one per cent, of stearic acid can be detected, and if seven or 
eight per cent, is present it remains diffused through the water as a 
thick creamy mass.

Stearic acid may be detected by heating a small quantity of the 
sample with an aqueous solution of a copper salt or of a copper po- 
tassium hydroxide reagent. Pure beeswax retains its yellow tint or a 
pale green color. If stearic acid is present a light green color will be 
produced. 1 

An artificial substitute for beeswax 2 has been made as follows: 

Paraffin 60 

Rosin 40 

Run into cakes and cover with genuine beeswax. 

Uses. White wax is used in the preparation of the official cerate, 
ointment, and ointment of rose water; while the yellow wax is found 
in the official resin cerate, resin plaster, tar ointment, and cantharides 
cerate, as well as indirectly in cantharides plaster. Beeswax is also 
used in the manufacture of candles

Melting point 42 C. to 50 C. 

Solidifying point 41 C. to 45.5 C. 

* Determination by T. C. Lee in the Author's Laboratory. 

The average constants on the analysis of 17 samples of spermaceti 
by Kebler 2 gave results as follows: 

Specific gravity at 15 C 0.928 

Saponification value 128.8 

Acid value 1.61 

Melting point . . 45 C. 

Principal Components. The chief constituent of spermaceti is 
cetin, or cetyl palmitate. 

Preparation and Yield. Although the U.S.P. recognizes the sperm 
whale as the only source of spermaceti, it is found in the bottlenose 
whale as well as in shark oil and dolphin oil. 

It is prepared by placing the head and body blubber of the sperm 
whale in refrigerated chambers for several days and then removing 
the oil by hydraulic pressure. The solid remaining consists of crude 
spermaceti. Crude sperm oil contains about 11 per cent, of spermaceti.

Properties and Tests. Spermaceti occurs in white, somewhat 
translucent, slightly unctuous masses, with a scaly, crystalline frac- 
ture, a pearly luster, a very faint odor and a bland, mild taste. It 
is insoluble in water, and nearly so in cold alcohol; soluble in boiling 
alcohol, ether, chloroform, carbon disulphide, or fixed or volatile oils; 
only slightly soluble in cold petroleum benzin. U.S. P. 

Adulterants. Stearic acid, tallow and paraffin are the most likely 
adulterants. 

The U.S. P. test for the absence of stearic acid is as follows: About 
1 gram of spermaceti is warmed with ammonia water until melted; 
then shaken thoroughly, cooled and filtered. The filtrate, upon 
supersaturation with hydrochloric acid, does not yield a precipitate, 
although it may become turbid. Dunlop 1 states that this test is 
reliable down to 3 per cent, but with smaller quantities the test is 
somewhat uncertain. 

Tallow would be detected by the iodine value and paraffin by 
saponification. 

Uses. Spermaceti is used in the manufacture of candles and for 
pharmaceutical purposes. It is used in the preparation of the official 
"Unguentum Aquae Rosae." 

By-Products. In the production of spermaceti there is recovered a 
large amount of sperm oil, or, it would probably be nearer correct to 
say that in expressing sperm oil from the blubber of the sperm whale 
there remains a by-product, spermaceti. As both are true waxes 
spermaceti a solid, and sperm oil a liquid wax both when saponified 
produce higher alcohols and fatty acids.

Principal Components. Allen 2 has found the fatty acids from sperm 
oil to have characteristics of an acid of the oleic series mixed with 
one of the stearic series. Lewkowitsch 3 states that the nature of the 
alcohols of sperm oil is unknown. Contrary to the experience of

158 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Allen and Lewkowitsch, Fendler 1 claims to have found glycerin to 
the extent of 1.32 per cent, in sperm oil of known purity. Dunlop 2 
confirms the statement of Fendler and has found 1.36 to 2.56 per cent, 
of glycerin in pure sperm oil. 

Preparation. As has been indicated, in the preparation of sperm- 
aceti, the blubber of the sperm whale is placed in refrigerating tanks 
and by hydraulic pressure the oil is obtained. 

Properties and Tests. Pure sperm oil is a thin, odorless and 
colorless, or slightly yellowish, liquid. 

Most fatty oils used to adulterate sperm oil would be detected by 
the raising of the iodine number. For mineral oils, the examination 
of the unsaponifiable matter will give the desired information. 

Uses. As it retains its viscosity under the influence of heat, it is 
extensively used for lubricating quickly-moving light machinery, and 
for burning in miners' lamps. 

Ambergris. 

Ambergris is a fatty, waxy substance, and is supposed to be a 
morbid secretion of the sperm whale. The growth is alleged to be 
caused by the irritation of the intestines by fragments of cuttlefish 
beaks that are swallowed by the whale. Ambergris has a gray- 
white color, often with a black streak, and a slight agreeable odor 
like that of benzoic acid. It is said to contain 2.5 per cent, of benzoic 
acid and 85 per cent, of amberin, a substance crystallisable from 
alcohol. Ambergris is found in the intestines of the whale as well 
as floating on the sea along the coasts of Arabia, Madagascar and 
Japan. Lumps of ambergris weighing as much as 200 to 300 pounds 
have been found. 
Ambergris is used in the manufacture of perfumery.

Federal definitions for cocoanut oil i 1 



Cocoanut oil is the oil obtained from the kernels of the cocoanut (Cocos nucifera 
L.) and subjected to the usual refining processes and free from rancidity. 
Cochin oil is cocoanut oil prepared in Cochin (Malabar). 
Ceylon oil is cocoanut oil prepared in Ceylon. 
Copra oil is cocoanut oil prepared from copra the dried kernels of the cocoanut. 

Owing to the similarity of the names, cocoa butter and cocoanut 
oil or butter, Neufeld 2 recommends that cocoa fat from the seeds of 
the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) should always be written cacao 
butter. 

Principal Components. Glycerides of caproic, caprilic, capric, 
lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids (Elsdon). 

Preparation and Yield. The oil is obtained from the ground, white 
cocoanut pulp copra by hydraulic pressure or by extraction with 
suitable solvents. The yield of oil is 40 to 45 per cent. The oil is 
purified by a number of methods. It is stated that the addition of 
1 per cent, of sulphuric acid removes the gelatinous and albuminous 
substance and partially bleaches the oil; also, improves the odor 
and tends to prevent rancidity. Walker 3 claims if copra is dried 
so that it does not contain more than 5 per cent, of moisture, the 
expressed oil will be free from rancidity and the keeping qualities will 
equal that of other oils and fats.

162 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Neutral cocoanut oil is produced by treating the oil with alcohol and 
animal charcoal. 

Properties and Tests. Cocoanut oil is a white, or slightly colored, 
fat, having the characteristic odor and taste of cocoanut. It has the 
consistence of butter at 25 C. or under, and is often called cocoanut 
butter and in some localities cocoanut lard. Slightly above 25 C. it is 
liquefied. 

The purity of cocoanut oil would be indicated by determining the 
constants. 

Uses. Cocoanut oil is used in the manufacture of soaps, and for 
pharmaceutical purposes; in the manufacture of toilet articles, as a 
lubricant, and as an adulterant for lard and butter. Large quantities 
of cocoanut oil are used in the manufacture of oleomargarine or the 
so-called "nut margarine." 

Hydrogenated cocoanut oil is used as a substitute for lard. The 
result of analysis of such a product, which follows, indicates practically 
pure cocoanut oil, hydrogenated, without the addition of other oils.

Specific gravity at 40 C./25 C 0.8718 

Refractive index at 40 C 1.4501 

Iodine value 8.16 

Saponification value 258.61 

By-Products. Cocoanut cake is used as a stock food. 

Calmette 1 states that good beer may be prepared from cocoanut 
milk, which contains 9 to 13 per cent, of fermentable sugar. He adds 
cane sugar to the milk and boils for an hour and a half with hops; 
filters and ferments with yeast. The beer contains 3.4 per cent, of 
alcohol and 3.1 per cent, of extract. 

The outer portion of the cocoanut fruit consists of a fibrous mass 
which is used in the manufacture of ropes, mats and carpets. 

Winton 2 has shown that ground cocoanut shells are frequently 
used in the adulteration of spices. 

Cocoanut shells are used for the manufacture of a very fine grade of 
charcoal which is used in gas masks.

Principal Components. Glycerides of palmitic, stearic, arachidic, 
oleic and linolenic acids, together with a volatile oil and a considerable 
amount of unsaponifiable matter. 

Preparation and Yield. Corn oil is produced from the germs ob- 
tained in the manufacture of starch, glucose, grits, corn meal and 
hominy; also, as a by-product in the production of alcohol. 

Corn is malted and crushed and the germs separated, which are of 
no value in the production of alcohol. The oil is obtained from the 
germs by hydraulic pressure. The whole corn contains from 6 to 
10 per cent, of oil, while the dry germs contain over 50 per cent, and 
the actual yield from the dry germs by pressure is near 40 per cent, of 
oil. 

Properties and Tests. Corn oil has a pale yellow or golden yellow 
color and a characteristic odor and taste. The taste resembles that 
of corn meal. 

The oil is slightly soluble in absolute alcohol and glacial acetic 
acid. 

Cold nitric acid of 1.375 specific gravity gives a bright red color 
when shaken with corn oil. (Archbutt.) 1 

Vulte and Gibson 2 call attention to the fact that a fine violet colora- 
tion is produced when one drop of concentrated sulphuric acid is 
added to a carbon disulphide solution of corn oil and the mixture 
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. 

The Author has found that corn oil will give a permanent blue when 
treated with an equal amount of glacial acetic acid or acetic anhydride 
and one or two drops of Froehde's reagent. The color is not pro- 
duced until the mixture stands a few minutes. If the acetic acid and 
Froehde's reagent are first mixed, then added to the corn oil and the 
mixture shaken, the blue color will be produced at once. However, this 
color test is not characteristic of corn oil only, as peanut, soya bean 
and other vegetable oils give the same coloration, as well as codliver 
and other animal oils. It appears the reaction is due to phytosterol 
and cholesterol and not to any coloring in the oils, as the color is 
produced with Froehde's reagent in oils like cocoanut.

OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 165 

If concentrated sulphuric acid is used in place of Froehde's reagent a 
fugitive blue color will be produced. 

Froehde's Reagent (sulphomolybdic acid) is prepared by dissolving 
10 grams of molybdic acid in 100 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid. 

Uses. Corn oil is used as an edible oil (salad oil). It is used in 
the manufacture of oleomargarine and compound lard, and is recom- 
mended for use in the manufacture of various pharmaceutical prepara- 
tions. The low grade oil is used in the manufacture of soap. 

Argo oil, mazola oil and butterkorn oil are all claimed to be refined 
corn oil and more economical than lard for cooking purposes, as they 
do not transmit taste or odor from one food to another and may be 
used over and over again. 

The manufacturers of butterkorn oil 1 publish the following analysis 
of their product : 

Cholesterol 1.25 

Lecithin 1.50 

Stearin 3.80 

Olein 46.20 

Linolin 47.25 

This being a vegetable oil, it is somewhat doubtful about its con- 
taining cholesterol, but it probably contains sitosterol or phytosterol, 
or a mixture of the two, in amount claimed for cholesterol.

PALM OIL. 

Huile de palme, Fr. Olio di palma, It. Palmol, G. 
Palm oil is obtained from the fruit of the palm tree (Elaeis guineensis 
and Elaeis melanococca), indigenous to West Africa. The species 
Elaeis melanococca is cultivated in South America. 
The United States imported palm oil as follows: 

For the year ending June 30, 1918, 27,408,494 pounds. 
For the year ending June 30, 1919, 19,280,762 pounds.

Too~ 

Preparation and Yield. Palm trees grow to a height of 30 to 40 
feet and bear seven or eight fruit or cones about the size of a man's 
head. The fleshy portion of the fruit as well as the kernel yields oil. 
The oil obtained from the pericarp is a deep, yellowish, blood red 
color, while that obtained from the kernel is white. 

The fruit is gathered by children and women and placed into a 
hole dug in the ground and lined with leaves. Water is sprinkled 
on the fruit and it is then covered with more leaves and left to ferment 
for about two weeks. The fleshy part of the fruit softens and the 
kernels (palm nuts) are removed. 

The fermented fruit is placed in a large mortar, made by lining a 
hole in the ground with stone. The fruit is then beaten into a pulp 
with wooden pestles. Another hole is then made in the ground and 



OILS, FATS AND WAXES. 167 

cemented the cement being composed of palm oil and wood ashes. 
The crushed fruit is placed over this hole so that the oil will drain into 
it. This method produces what is considered a superior oil. 

The oil is also produced by boiling the pulp with water and skimming 
off the oil which rises to the surface. The residue is placed into a 
bag and squeezed by hand to obtain more of the oil. 

The above methods for obtaining the oil are very crude and result 
in the loss of a large portion of the oil. Palm oil in the pulp runs from 
46 to 62.5 per cent, and in the whole fruit from 22.64 to 44.44 per cent. 

Bernegau 1 has devised a modern method of obtaining edible palm 
oil. The fruit is freed from the kernels and the fleshy portion digested 
in a vacuum vessel at a low temperature for several hours with 90 
per cent, alcohol. Then the alcoholic, oily solution is cooled and 
drawn into a collecting vessel protected from air and light. The 
spiritous oil solution is filtered and the alcohol recovered by distilla- 
tion in vacuo. The fruit juice that has been extracted with the fat 
is separated from the fat by employing cold, which solidifies the fat, 
and the juice can be poured off. 

Palm oil from the pulp should not be confused with palm kernel oil. 
Palm kernels contain from 48.9 to 49.2 per cent, of oil. The kernels 
are mostly exported and very little oil is produced by the natives from 
them. Palm kernel oil has a higher saponification value and a lower 
iodine value than palm oil. 

Properties and Tests. Palm oil has the consistency of soft butter 
to that of tallow; and a color from orange-yellow to dark red. The 
color is not destroyed by saponification. It frequently contains a 
large proportion of free fatty acids. 

There have been a number of color tests proposed for the detection 
of palm oil. The one that has been given considerable prominence, 
owing to court proceedings, is the Liebermann-Storch test for rosin 
oil which was applied to palm oil by Crampton and Simons, 2 who 
claim that with palm oil a blue color with a tint of green is produced 
in the lower acidulated layer which settles out when applying this 
test in the usual manner. 

In reviewing a number of color tests for oils, Gill 3 states that the 
above test for palm oil is not reliable and gives the following reasons : 

I. Unreliability of this particular test; no two chemists agreeing 
upon its interpretation. 

II. That the test is one for carotin rather than palm oil, and may 
be given by butter, oleo oil or sesame oil ingredients ordinarily 
found in oleomargarine.

3 J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 1917, 9, 139. 



168 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

III. As applied by the Revenue Department, it is untrustworthy, 
because interfering oils, as sesame, are not washed out. 

Palm oil is not often adulterated with other fats and oils but its 
detection in oleomargarine is very important as it is considered a 
coloring when used in the manufacture of oleomargarine. 

Uses. As has been indicated, palm oil is used as an edible oil and 
also in the manufacture of oleomargarine. It is used in the manu- 
facture of soap and candles. The natives of Africa eat the oil as 
butter and use it in anointing their bodies. Owing to its non-drying 
qualities, it is used in the manufacture of tin plate preventing the 
heated iron sheet from oxidizing until the moment of dipping it into 
the bath of melted tin the sheets being rapidly transferred to that 
from the hot oil bath, which consists almost entirely of palm oil. 

Bailey 1 states that the indications are that hydrogenated cotton- 
seed oil will soon be used as a flux in the tin-plate industry in place of 
palm oil.

170 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The Federal Standard of peanut oil is as follows: 

Peanut oil, 1 arachis oil, earthnut oil, is the oil obtained from the peanut (Arachis 
hypogaea L.) and subjected to the usual refining processes. It is free from rancidity; 
has a refractive index (25 C.) not less than one and forty-six hundred and ninety 
ten-thousandths (1.4690) and not exceeding one and forty-seven hundred and seven 
ten-thousandths (1.4707), and an iodine number not less than eighty-seven (87) and 
not exceeding one hundred (100). 

"Cold-drawn" peanut oil is peanut oil obtained by pressure without heating. 

Von Engelen 2 proposes a color test for peanut oil as follows : Molybdic 
reagent is made by dissolving 0.25 grams of sodium molybdate in 
20 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid, or, Froehde's reagent, recently 
prepared, may be used. The molybdic reagent produces a greenish- 
yellow color with peanut oil without shaking the liquid, and a purple 
color with shaking. Froehde's reagent gives with the oil without 
shaking a greenish color and with shaking a violet color. 

The method for detecting and estimating arachidic acid is the most 
conclusive test for determining the purity of peanut oil. The oil 
should contain about 5 per cent, of arachidic acid. A test for the 
detection of arachidic acid has already been given under olive oil. 

The A.O.A.C. 3 official method for the determination of arachidic 
acid in peanut oil is a modified form of the Renard method and is as 
follows : 

Weigh 20 grams of the oil into an Erlenmeyer flask. Saponify with alcoholic 
potash solution, neutralize exactly with dilute acetic acid, using phenolphthalein as 
indicator, and wash into an 800 to 1000 cc. flask containing a boiling mixture of 100 
cc. of water and 120 cc. of 20 per cent, lead acetate solution. Boil for a minute and 
then cool the precipitated soap by immersing the flask in water, occasionally giving 
it a whirling motion to cause the soap to stick to the sides of the flask. After the 
flask has cooled decant the water and excess of lead acetate solution and wash the 
lead soap with cold water and alcohol 90 per cent, by volume; add 200 cc. of ether, 
cork and allow to stand for some time until the soap is disintegrated; heat on a water 
bath, using a reflux condenser, and boil for about 5 minutes. In the case of oils, 
most of the soap will be dissolved, while in lards, which contain stearin, part of the 
soap will be left undissolved. Cool the ether solution of soap to 15 to 17 C. and 
allow to stand until all the insoluble soaps have separated out (about 12 hours). 

Filter upon a Buchner funnel and thoroughly wash the insoluble lead soaps with 
ether. Wash the ether-insoluble lead soaps into a separately funnel by means of a 
jet of ether, alternating at the end of the operation, if a little of the soap sticks to the 
paper, with hydrochloric acid (1 to 3). Add sufficient hydrochloric acid (1 to 3) so 
that the total volume of the latter amounts to about 200 cc. and enough of the ether 
to make the total volume of 150 to 200 cc. and shake vigorously for several minutes. 
Allow the layers to separate, run off the acid layer, and wash the ether layer once with 
100 cc. of dilute hydrochloric acid and then with several portions of water, until the

water washings are no longer acid to methyl orange. If a few undecomposed lumps 
of lead soap remain (indicated by solid particles remaining after the third washing 
with water) break these up by running off almost all the water layer and then adding 
a little concentrated hydrochloric acid and shaking; then continue the washing as 
before with water. 

Distill the ether from the solution of insoluble fatty acids and dry the latter in the 
flask by adding a little absolute alcohol and evaporating on a steam bath. Dissolve 
the dry fatty acids by warming with 100 cc. of 90 per cent, alcohol by volume and 
cooling slowly to 15 C., shaking to aid crystallization. Allow to stand at 15 C, 
for 30 minutes. In the presence of peanut oil, crystals of arachidic acid will separate 
from the solution. Filter, wash and precipitate twice with 10 cc. of 90 per cent, 
alcohol by volume, and then with 70 per cent, of alcohol by volume, care being taken 
to maintain the arachidic acid and the wash solutions at a definite temperature in 
order to apply the solubility corrections given below. Dissolve the arachidic acid 
upon the filter with boiling absolute alcohol, evaporate to dryness in a weighed dish, 
dry and weigh. Add to the weight 0.0025 grams for each 10 cc. of 90 per cent, alcohol 
used in the crystallization and washing, if conducted at 15 C.; if conducted at 20 C. 
add 0.0045 grams for each 10 cc. 

The melting point of arachidic acid thus obtained is 71 to 72 C. Twenty times 
the weight of the arachidic acid will give the approximate amount of peanut oil 
present. Arachidic acid has a characteristic appearance and may be identified by the 
microscope. As little as 5 to 10 per cent, of peanut oil can be detected by this 
method. 

Kerr's Improved Method for the Detection of Arachidic Acid. 1 

This method is less complicated than the Renard and is applied as 
follows: 

Use 20 grams of the sample, the same as in Renard's. Place in a 300 cc. Erlen- 
meyer flask and add 200 cc. of 95 per cent, alcohol. Heat to boiling and saponify 
with 10 cc. of potassium hydroxide solution (100 grams KOH to 100 cc. water). 
After saponification, neutralize with alcoholic solution of acetic acid, using phenol- 
phthalein as indicator. Heat to boiling after the addition of 50 cc. of a 5 per cent, 
solution of magnesium acetate. After cooling to room temperature, place in a 
refrigerator for ten or twelve hours at a temperature of 10 to 15 C.; filter and wash 
the precipitate twice with 50 per cent, alcohol, and three times with distilled water. 
Return the washed precipitate to the flask and add 100 cc. of hot distilled water and 
decompose the magnesium salts with dilute sulphuric acid. Heat until the separated 
acids form a clear layer, cool and pour off the acid layer and again add 100 cc. of hot 
water. Cool and free the cake of acids from water as much as possible by draining, 
then dissolve the acids in 100 cc. of 90 per cent, alcohol. Bring the alcoholic mixture 
to the boiling point to dissolve the acids and then cool to 15 C., shaking thoroughly, 
and the arachidic acid will separate by crystallization. From this point follow the 
A.O.A.C. Method of washing the crystals and making correction for arachidic acid 
lost by washing. 

Reagents to be used in Kerr's method : 

Magnesium Acetate Solution: Ten grams of magnesium acetate to 
100 cc. distilled water and 100 cc. 95 per cent, alcohol. 

1 J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 1916, 8, 904. 



172 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Acetic Acid Solution: Fifty cc. glacial acetic acid to 150 cc. 95 per 
cent, alcohol. 

Sulphuric Acid Solution: Fifty cc. concentrated sulphuric acid to 
150 cc. distilled water. 

Peanut oil, adulterated with cottonseed oil, would have the iodine 
value raised and would also respond to the Halphen test. 

Notice of Judgment Number 3327 records an instance of peanut 
oil being adulterated with nitrobenzine. This appears to be an 
unusual adulterant. 

According to Lucas 1 peanut oil in Porto Rico is adulterated with 
nitrobenzol, which may be determined as aniline hydrochloride. 

Uses. Peanut oil is largely used as a salad oil and in the manu- 
facture of oleomargarine. Nut margarines are being advertised to 
contain peanut and cocoanut oils. The lower grade oils are used in 
the manufacture of soaps. 

By-Products. The peanut cake is used as a stock food. 

Peanut Butter. A preparation containing peanut oil without ex- 
pressing is extensively sold as peanut butter. It is prepared by roast- 
ing the peanuts and then blanching by removing the outer red skins and 
germs. This is done by machinery, as is also the removing of small 
pieces of rock and small pebbles. The better grades of peanut butter 
are prepared by blending Spanish and Virginia peanuts in equal 
quantities. The peanut butter is then prepared by simply grinding 
the peanuts. 

The analysis of peanut butter consists of extracting the oil from 
about 2 grams of the sample with ether in a Knorr or other extracting 
apparatus. The oil should then be examined to determine the purity 
of same. 

Utt 2 determined the percentage of oil in 23 samples of peanut butter 
and they averaged 49.95 per cent. The oil had a refractive index 
(average) at 25 C. of 1.4682 and the iodine value averaged 92.32 on 
8 samples. The samples were all considered pure.

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 1.4768 (Author) 

Refractive index at 20 C f 0.9194 (Author) 

Iodine value 130 to 135 

Saponifi cation value 191 to 194 

Solidification point -15 C. to -16 C. 

Reichert-Meissl Value 0.45 to 0.69 

Principal Components. Oleic, linolic, linolenic, stearic, and pal- 
mitic acids. 

Preparation and Yield. The finely ground meal is heated and 
pressed in the same manner as cottonseed; however, to produce a 
fair yield of oil it is necessary to have a very finely ground meal, and 
it should be cooked a considerable length of time owing to the small 
amount of oil in the beans. 

Soya beans contain from 16 to 23 per cent, of oil. 

The oil is refined, washed, bleached and filtered. The machinery 
used in the manufacture of cottonseed oil is suitable for the production 
of soya bean oil. 

Properties and Tests. Soya bean oil is a yellowish liquid having a 
characteristic odor and taste. 



174 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

For purity, the above mentioned constants should be determined. 
A color test is given by Settimj 1 as follows: An intense yellow color 
is produced on shaking a mixture of 5 cc. of soya bean oil with 2 cc. 
of chloroform and 3 cc. of a 2 per cent, aqueous solution of uranium 
nitrate. In case of peanut, rapeseed, cottonseed, corn and sesame 
oils the emulsion is white. Olive oil gives a greenish emulsion. 

Uses. Soya bean oil is used in soap making, in paints and varnishes 
and in making waterproof clothing. It is used as an edible oil in the 
manufacture of lard substitutes and oleomargarine. It is used to a 
limited extent as a lubricant and burning oil. " German Coffee 
Berry" is a species of soya bean, the seed of which, being parched and 
ground, is used as coffee. 

By-Products. The soya bean meal is a valuable stock food. 

Natto. 

Although "natto" is not a by-product, as generally understood, 
it is prepared from soya beans and will be considered in this connection. 

"Natto," a vegetable cheese made by fermenting boiled soya beans, 
and a number of other preparations produced from soya beans, are 
used in Japan and China. "Tofu" is a liquid preparation resembling 
cow's milk, and is manufactured from soya beans. 

Muramatsu 2 has investigated " natto" to a considerable extent 
and states that the boiled soya beans are wrapped in rice straw and 
allowed to ferment two days. The fermentation is due to aerobic 
bacteria which develop most rapidly in a temperature of 40 to 50 C., 
producing the best, quality of " natto" with a good aroma. For this 
reason a better quality of " natto" is produced by wrapping the boiled 
soya beans in fresh rice straw, permitting the admittance of plenty of 
oxygen. 

" Natto" consists of over 50 per cent, of moisture and the water 
free matter has the following composition according to Muramatsu : 

Crude protein 46.088 

Crude fat 20.216 

Crude fiber 6.140 

N-free extract 3.348 

Ash 5.010 

Total N 7.374 

Albuminoid N. . . . 5.458 

Non-albuminoid N 1.916 

It is noticeable that "natto" contains only two-fifths as much vege- 
table fat as cheese in this country contains milk fat, calculated on the 
water-free substance.

Li 1 has patented a preparation called "soya bean chocolate," which 
is prepared by roasting soya beans with cacao beans and then grinding 
to a powder, or, decorticated soya beans are mixed with cacao butter, 
roasted and ground to a powder.

CHAPTER VI. 

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 

MILK. 

The definition and standard of milk by the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture 1 is as follows : 

"Milk is the fresh, clean lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of 
one or more healthy cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained within 
fifteen days before and ten days after calving, and contains not less than eight and 
one-half (8.5) per cent, of solids not fat, and not less than three and one-quarter 
(3.25) per cent, of milk fat." 

" Pasteurized Milk is milk that has been heated below the boiling point, but suffici- 
ently to kill most of the active organisms present, and immediately cooled to 50 F. 
or lower." 

"Sterilized Milk is milk that has been heated at a temperature of boiling water or 
higher for a length of time sufficient to kill all organisms present." 

"Skim Milk is milk from which part or all of the cream has been removed and 
contains not less than nine and one-quarter (9.25) per cent, of milk solids." 

"Blended Milk is milk modified in its composition so as to have a definite and 
stated percentage of one or more of its constituents." 

In Food Inspection Decision 178 the above definitions and standards 
have been modified by leaving out the percentage of fat and solids of 
milk and the solids in skimmed milk. The definition and standard of 
buttermilk has been changed to a certain extent and a definition for 
homogenized milk has been added. The new standards for butter- 
milk and homogenized milk are as follows: 

"Buttermilk is the product that remains when fat is removed from milk or cream, 
sweet or sour, in the process of churning. It contains not less than eight and five- 
tenths per cent. (8.5%) of milk solids, not fat." 

"Homogenized Milk or Homogenized Cream is milk or cream that has been mechan- 
ically treated in such a manner as to alter its physical properties, with particular 
reference to the condition and appearance of the fat globules." 

The different State laws are not all in conformity with the Federal 
law; for instance, under the Ohio law, milk containing more than 
eighty-eight per cent of watery fluid or less than twelve per cent, of 
solids or three per cent, fat is considered adulterated. On conviction, 
the fine for selling adulterated milk in Ohio is not less than fifty dollars 
nor more than two hundred dollars; for a second offense, the fine is 

1 U. S. Dept. Agr. Cir. 19, 6. 

176

177 



not less than one hundred dollars nor more than three hundred dollars, 
and imprisonment may also be imposed. 

Minnesota has the highest requirement of total solids, which is 13 
per cent. Louisiana and Maryland require the highest percentage 
of fat, that is 3.50. Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, 
Kentucky, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, 
Washington and Wyoming all require 3.25 per cent, of fat, the same 
as the Federal Standard. 

Although the composition of milk varies to a certain extent, taking 
it one year with another, the variation is not very marked, as will 
be shown by the following compilations : 

Lythgoe 1 has reported on 434 samples of milk of known purity and

Richmond 1 gives as the average composition of samples of milk 
examined in 1913 at the laboratory of the Alesbury Dairy Company 
as follows: 

Total solids 12.48

The average fat from the morning milking was less than from the 
evening milking. 

Kumiss is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of mare's, camel's 
or cow's milk and is used as a beverage. Kephir or kefir is a variety 
of kumiss made by inducing fermentation by the use of kefir, a species 
of fungi. Following will be found the analysis of kumiss and kephir: 2 

Kumiss Kephir 

Albumin 11.2 38.0 

Butter 20.5 20.0 

Sugar of Milk 22.0 20.0 

Lactic acid 11.5 9.0 

Alcohol 16.5 8.0 

Water and Salt 918.3 905.0 

1000.0 1000.0 

Certified Milk is milk that is produced under certain sanitary con- 
ditions which is certified to by a milk commission, board of health, or 
a medical milk commission. The milk commission specifies standards 
for the composition and bacterial content of the milk. Generally 
not over 10,000 bacteria per cubic centimeter are permissible. The 
commission also inspects the premises where the milk is produced and 
examines the cows. It is generally required that certified milk con- 
tain from 3.50 to 5.00 per cent, of fat and 12 to 14 per cent, of total 
solids. 

Inspected Milk is milk inspected by the milk commission but with 
lower requirements than for certified milk. The cows must be kept 
free from tuberculosis and the bacterial count must be under 100,000 
per cubic centimeter. 

* 'Aldehyde " Value of Milk. When formaldehyde is added to 
milk the acidity is increased. The maximum acidity is reached on 
the addition of 1.8 per cent., or about 5 per cent, of the ordinary 40 
per cent, formaldehyde solution.

180 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The difference between the original acidity of the milk and the 
acidity after the addition of 5 per cent, of neutral formaldehyde is 
termed the "aldehyde" value. 

Richmond and Miller l give as the "aldehyde value" or "Figure" 
an average of 19.9, that is the number of cc. normal alkali required to 
neutralize one litre of milk. 

As the aldehyde figure is proportional to the total nitrogen in milk, 
advantage has been taken of the fact in the determination of the amino- 
nitrogen of the proteids. 

The Action of Bacteria on Milk. 

Many peculiar changes in milk are due to the action of bacteria. 

* 'Soapy" Milk has a characteristic soapy taste and produces a 
strong lather. These properties are due to the presence of Bac. lactis 
saponacei. 

"Ropy" Milk is due either to enormously swollen membrane of 
bacteria or the formation of slimy albuminoid bodies probably 
Bac. lactis viscosus. 

Blue Coloration of Milk depends upon the growth of certain species 
of bacteria, one of which is Bacillus cyanogenus. The color appears 
at first on the surface of the raw milk and afterwards penetrates to 
the lower layers. Bac. lactis erythrogenes is said to produce "Red 
Milk" as well as Sarcina rosea; and "Yellow Milk" is produced by 
Bac. synxanthus. 

Tyrotoxicon has been found in milk, cheese and ice cream. In 
1885 Vaughn 2 found tyrotoxicon in milk which had stood in a well- 
stoppered bottle for about six months. The poison is detected as 
follows : The filtered milk, which is acid in reaction, is neutralized with 
sodium carbonate, agitated with an equal volume of ether, and allowed 
to stand in a stoppered, glass cylinder for twenty-four hours; the ether 
is then removed and allowed to evaporate spontaneously from an 
open dish. The aqueous residue is acidified with nitric acid, then 
treated with an equal volume of a saturated solution of potassium 
hydroxide, and the whole concentrated on the water bath (this com- 
pound is not decomposed below 130). On being heated the mixture 
becomes yellowish-brown and emits a peculiar, aromatic odor. On 
cooling, the tyrotoxicon compound forms in beautiful, six-sided plates 
along with the prisms of potassium nitrate.

Buttermilk. 

The Federal definition and standard for buttermilk, which has 
already been given, is as follows: Buttermilk is the product that re- 
mains when fat is removed from milk or cream, sweet or sour, in the 
process of churning. It contains not less than eight and five-tenths 
(8.5) per cent, of milk solids, not fat. 

Blyth 1 gives the average composition of buttermilk as follows: 

Water 90.62 

Casein 3.78 

Fat 1.25 

Milk sugar 3.38 

Lactic acid 0.32 

Ash 0.65 

Buttermilk is a by-product in butter making. Large quantities 
are used for culinary purposes and a considerable amount for children 
and invalids. It is also a popular and refreshing drink. 

Conn 2 calls attention to the fact that buttermilk contains from 
200,000,000 to 500,000,000 harmless bacteria per cc. and that it is al- 
most a pure culture of lactic acid bacteria, and as such can be used to 
very great advantage in cases where acid organisms are needed in the 
intestines. 

Buttermilk Tablets are essentially composed of Bacillus bulgaricus 
or, "bulgarian ferment," and when added to sweet milk invert the 
milk sugar and transform the product (glucose and galactose) into 
lactic acid. Buttermilk, so prepared from whole milk, would be much 
richer in butter fat than the ordinary buttermilk.

of methylene blue and 5 cc. of 40 per cent, formaldehyde in 190 cc. of 
water. The contents of the tube are covered with a layer of liquid 
petrolatum to prevent access of air, and the tube is then placed in a 
water bath at a temperature of 45 to 50 C. Raw milk will decolorize 
this reagent in less than 20 minutes; pasteurized milk will take a 
longer time. 

Paraphenylenediamine Test. Shake 10 cc. of milk with one or 
two drops of hydrogen peroxide solution (U.S. P.); then add two or 
three drops of a 2 per cent, alcoholic solution of paraphenylene- 
diamine. If the milk is raw a dark violet color is produced. This 
test will give coloration with watered and skimmed milk but with 
less intensity than with pure milk. 

Richmond 1 recommends the use of metaphenylenediamine in place 
of paraphenylenediamine, and shaking out with amyl alcohol. The 
color (blue) is taken up by the amyl alcohol and remains permanent 
when the meta-compound is used; but with the para-compound the 
blue color turns brown when the solution is exposed to the air. 

De Roi and Koehler 2 claim that 2 per cent, of raw milk in heated 
milk may be detected by shaking fifty cc. of the sample with one 
cc. of one per cent, solution of hydrogen peroxide, and pouring three 
cc. of the mixture into a tube containing an equal volume of a solution 
of starch and potassium iodide. On agitation a blue iodine color 
will be produced in case of raw milk. With heated milk the mixture 
remains colorless. 

METHOD OF ANALYSIS. 

Preparation of Sample for Analysis. The milk should be trans- 
ferred from the bottle in which it is received to a large beaker and 
poured back and forth several times until it is uniform. In case of 
milk received in milk cans, the total amount should be poured from 
one can to another the same as in a bottle of milk. 

Sour Milk 3 may be re-emulsified by the use of ammonia. Add a 
sufficient quantity of concentrated ammonia to the curdled milk to 
restore it to its natural limpid emulsified condition. The milk will 
then be in a condition for analysis. 

The solids from milk treated with ammonia will appear darker than 
untreated milk, and become brown like partially caramelized sugar; 
however, this does not reduce the percentage of solids to any marked 
extent (about 0.2 per cent, generally). The fat may be determined 
either by volumetric or gravimetric methods in the usual manner.

If any appreciable amount of 'ammonia is used in neutralizing the 
milk, a correction should be made for the increase in volume. 

Ordinarily the determination of water, solids, fat and ash is all 
that is necessary, except in cases where bacteriological examinations 
are required. 

In a complete analysis of milk the chemical examination would 
include the following: 

Specific gravity. 

Solids. 

Ash. 

Fat. 

Lactose. (Milk sugar.) 

Protein compounds. (Casein and Albumin.) 

Preservatives. 

Coloring. 

Specific gravity is generally determined by a Quevenne lactometer, 
although a pycnometer should be used for absolute work. In either 
case it should be taken at a certain temperature, say 25 C. The 
average specific gravity of unadulterated milk should be near 1.0320. 

Solids are determined as follows : Weigh approximately 5 grams 
of the sample into a flat-bottomed platinum milk pan, about 55 mm. in 
diameter at the top and 45 mm. at the bottom, and 16 mm. in depth. 
Evaporate on a water bath or in an electric oven at 100 C. to a con- 
stant weight, which will require two or three hours. Cool in a desic- 
cator and weigh. 

A number of formulas have been proposed for the calculation of the 
total solids when the lactometer reading has been taken and the fat 
determined. Richmond's formula is as follows: 



T = Total solids. 

G = Last two figures of Quevenne lactometer reading. 

F = Fat. 

Later Babcock proposed a formula which is practically the same as 
above, except that he does not add the constant factor of 0.14, and 
therefore, in calculations made according to Babcock's method the 
results are 0.14 less than by the Richmond formula. 

Babcock's formula: 

T=-+1.'2F. 

4 

T = Total solids. 

L = Lactometer reading (Quevenne). 

F = Fat. 



184 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

With the Quevenne lactometer the specific gravity is read to the 
third decimal place. In case the lactometer of the New York Board 
of Health is used, which has a scale reading where the minimum 
density of milk at 15 C. is represented as 100 and the milk has a 
specific gravity of 1.029, it may be converted into degrees of the 
Quevenne instrument by multiplying by 0.29. 

Richmond's milk scale is constructed on the principle of the slide 
rule, which is very convenient to use in place of the formulas. Fats, 
solids and specific gravity, corresponding to any data observed, may 
be read off; also corrections of specific gravity and temperature. 

In routine milk analysis the specific gravity is seldom determined, 
that is, in case the solids are estimated gravimetrically. 

Water is determined by subtracting the percentage of solids from 
100 the difference being considered as water, or watery fluid. 

Added Water. The solids not fat in milk should be not less than 
8.5 per cent, and much below this percentage would indicate that 
water had been added. If the milk has been both watered and 
skimmed, the solids might remain normal as well as the ash. The 
ash in unadulterated milk should be near 0.68 to 0.70 per cent. In case 
of skimming the percentage of ash would be increased; however, if 
watered the ash would be lowered, and it skimmed and watered it 
might remain normal. Whole milk especially high in fats will gener- 
ally show ash below the figures indicated. 

Milk Serum. It has been proposed to determine the specific 
gravity, refractive index and ash of milk serum as the constants thus 
obtained are more uniform than those of whole milk. 

If the Zeiss immersion refractometer reading is less than 39, the 
specific gravity less than 1.0270 and the ash less than 0.715 on sweet 
milk serum, and the refraction on sour milk serum is below 38.3 and 
the ash below 0.730 grams per 100 cc., the indications would be added 
water. 

Lythgoe and Nurenberg 1 give the specific gravity of milk serum 
from natural souring as low as 1.0221, which figure would pass most 
watered milk as pure. Woodman 2 states that the specific gravity of 
serum from natural milk is never below 1.027 and that the decrease 
from the addition of 10 per cent, of water varies from 0.0035 to 0.0010. 

(a) Zeiss Refractometer Reading is determined as follows : 3 
To 100 cc. of milk, at a temperature of about 20 C., add 2 cc. of 25 per 
cent, acetic acid (sp. gr. 1.035) in a beaker and heat the mixture, covered 
with a watch glass, in a water bath for 20 minutes at a temperature of

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 185 

70 C. Place the beaker on ice water for 10 minutes and separate 
the curd from the serum by filtering through a 12.5 cm. folded filter. 
Transfer about 35 cc. of the serum to one of the beakers that ac- 
company the control-temperature bath used in connection with the 
Zeiss immersion refractometer and take the refractometer reading 
at exactly 20 C., using a thermometer graduated to tenths of a degree. 
A reading below 39 indicates added water; between 39 and 40 the 
addition of water is suspected. 

(b) Ash. Transfer 25 cc. of the serum to a flat-bottomed platinum 
dish and evaporate to dryness on a water bath. Then heat over a 
low flame (to avoid spattering) until the contents are thoroughly 
charred ; place the dish in an electric muffle, preferably with pyrom- 
eter attached, and ignite to a white ash at a temperature not greater 
than 500 C. (900 F.). Cool and weigh. Express the result as 
grams per 100 cc. Results below 0.715 grams per 100 cc. indicate 
added water. Multiply by the factor 1.021 (dilution of the acetic 
acid serum being 2 per cent.) to obtain the result on the sour serum 
ash. 

Copper sulphate may be used in preparing the serum for refraction. 
The method is as follows: To one volume of copper suphate solution 
(72.5 grams of copper sulphate per liter, adjusted if necessary to read 
36 at 20 C. on the scale of the Zeiss immersion refractometer, or to a 
specific gravity of 1.0443 at 20 C./4 C.) add four volumes of milk. 
Shake well and filter. Determine the Zeiss refractometer reading 
of the clear serum at 20 C. A reading below 36 indicates added 
water. 

In case an immersion refractometer is not available and the Abbe, 
instrument is used, the indices of refraction may be converted into 
scale readings of the immersion refractometer by the following table 
as given by Leach and Lythgoe. 1 

Nitrates in Milk. Nitrates in milk of low constants would indicate 
added water. Nitrates are detected as follows: Reagent: Add 50 cc. 
of water to 0.085 gram of diphenylamine sulphate contained in a large 
flask, then gradually add 450 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid. 
Test: To 1 cc. of milk serum add 4 cc. of the reagent; mix and cool. 
In presence of traces of nitrates a blue color will be produced. 

Solids Not Fat. The Federal standard provides for solids not fat 
in milk and it should contain not less than 8.5 per cent. The same 
provision is made by many State enactments. If the solids not fat 
are below 8.5 per cent, it is an indication that the milk has been 
watered. Skimming milk has a tendency to raise the percentage of 
solids not fat.

Ash. The ash is determined by incinerating the solids until a 
perfectly white ash is obtained which is cooled in a desiccator and 
weighed. 

As given by most European authorities, the average ash of milk 
is 0.75 per cent. In this country it is generally given as 0.70 per 
cent. The analyses of many samples made by the writer would in- 
dicate 0.68 as being nearer correct for unadulterated milk. 

When milk has had the fat removed the ash is high. When the 
milk has been watered the ash is low. Milk exceptionally high in 
fat generally has a low ash. 

Fat. Leffmann and Beam in 1889 were the originators of the 
centrifugal method for the determination of fat. They claim "the 
distinctive difference is the use of fusel oil, the effect of which is to 
produce a greater difference in surface tension between the fat and the 
liquid in which it is suspended, and thus promote its readier separation. 
This effect has been found to be heightened by the presence of a small 
amount of hydrochloric acid." 

The Leffmann and Beam modified method, to use the ordinary 18 
gram milk bottle would be as follows: mix 17.6 cc. of the sample 
with 4 cc. of a mixture of equal parts of amyl alcohol and hydrochloric 
acid, let stand 5 minutes and then add 10 cc. of sulphuric acid (sp. 
gr. 1.84); shake into solution and fill the bottle with 50 per cent, 
sulphuric acid, recently made so it is still hot; let stand 1 minute and 
then whirl in the machine 3 minutes; place the bottle in water at 57 
to 60 C. for 15 minutes, and then read the percentage of fat. 



DAIRY PRODUCTS. 187 

In 1890 Babcock proposed a method for the determination of fat in 
milk which has practically superseded the Leffmann and Beam method, 
and is in universal use by dairymen in the United States as well as 
in daily use in all chemical laboratories where milk is tested. 

Babcock Method. In this method a centrifuge, or what is generally 
called a Babcock tester or machine, is necessary. There are a number 
of kinds of centrifuges sold arranged to be operated by hand, by 
steam, by water, and by electricity. In purchasing a centrifuge for 
milk analysis it is best to obtain one capable of carrying at least eight 
bottles, as it will often be found useful in other ways than testing 
milk; such as measuring the lead acetate precipitate in the analysis 
of maple products, vinegar, etc. 

In the Babcock method of determining fat in milk the test bottles 
are graduated on the basis of using eighteen grams of milk. In prac- 
tice, 17.6 cubic centimeters have been found to weigh, on the average, 
18 grams. As the specific gravity of milk should average 1.032, a 
milk pipette graduated to hold 17.6 cubic centimeters is generally used 
and the weighing of the sample is dispensed with. An equal volume 
of commercial sulphuric acid is added to the milk in the test bottle 
and the casein is dissolved by this reagent. After adding the acid 
the test bottle is rotated until the casein is completely dissolved when 
the mixture will have a uniform brownish-black appearance. Place 
the bottle in the centrifuge and run it for five minutes; then add hot 
water until the bottle is filled to the base of the graduated neck; then 
run the machine two minutes. Add hot water again until the upper 
mark of the graduated neck is nearly reached and then run the machine 
for one minute. The fat will be collected in the graduated neck and 
the percentage should be read at once, before cooling, at 57 to 60 C. 

Care should be taken to use acid of the proper strength. If the 
acid is too strong it will char the organic substances, and if too weak, 
the casein will not be completely dissolved. In either case the result 
will be incorrect. 

To obviate the difficulty of charring, Holm 1 suggests that the test 
be conducted as follows: 17.6 cc. of milk is measured into a Babcock 
milk bottle, or 18 grams of cream is weighed into a cream bottle; 
then by means of a pipette add 2 cc. of a mixture of glycerin 80 parts 
and water 20 parts, by volume, so that it will run down the inside of 
the neck of the bottle and under the milk. 17.6 cc. of commercial 
sulphuric acid is then added to each bottle being run in with the 
least possible agitation of contents. The acid will form a layer be- 
neath the glycerin which separates it from the milk and mechanically 
prevents char formation by the concentrated acid upon the milk

188 



PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



before the bottle is rotated. The contents of the bottle are then 
mixed by rotation and swung in the centrifuge as usual. 

The Author has been using a commercial sulphuric acid having a 
specific gravity of 1.83 at 25 C. and containing 91.5 per cent, absolute 
acid. With this strength acid, trouble from charring has not occurred, 
and uniform results have been obtained. 

The Ohio law provides that in making the Babcock test, milk 
pipettes shall have a capacity of 17.6 cubic centimeters, and the 
standard test bottles shall have a capacity of 2 cubic centimeters for 
each ten per cent, marked on the necks. Dealers selling pipettes and 
bottles not correctly graduated are subject to a fine of twenty five 
dollars. A fine of similar amount is provided for underreading or 
overreading in making the Babcock test on milk or cream. 

Gravimetric Method. A method which has been extensively used 
for determining fat in milk is known as Adam's Paper Coil method, 1 
which is as follows: Place about 5 cc. of milk in a 
weighing bottle and accurately weigh. Use a flat- 
bottomed weighing bottle, without a neck, and about 
^ 40 millimeters high and 25 millimeters in diameter. 
Take a strip of fat-free filter paper, about 65 by 560 
millimeters and make it into a coil. Place a small 
rubber band or fine wire around one end of the coil, 
then gradually insert the other end into the weighing 
bottle containing the milk. By giving the coil two or 
three turns, after most of the milk is absorbed, the 
balance will be taken up. Remove the coil and invert 
it upon a watch glass. The weighing bottle should now 
be reweighed and the difference in weight will be the 
^^ amount of milk absorbed by the coil. After thor- 
oughly drying the coil upon the watch glass, in

tracting Apparatus.

a water bath oven, place it in a Knorr extracting apparatus 
and extract with ether for 3 or 4 hours. Disconnect the Knorr

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 189 

flask and evaporate the ether on a water bath. Dry the fat in 
an oven at 100 C., cool and weigh. Deduct the weight of the flask 
and the difference will be the weight of the fat extracted from the 
amount of milk absorbed by the paper coil. From this the percentage 
can be readily calculated. 

The Author prefers to use a* Sy flask with the Knorr extracting 
apparatus as it is so much easier to clean and the extract is readily 
removed in case examination of the nature of the fat extracted be- 
comes necessary. 

Roese-Gottlieb Method is now official and is the gravimetric method 
mostly used in England. It is given in Methods of Analysis 1 as follows : 
Weigh 10 to 11 grams of the milk into a Rohrig tube, or some similar 
apparatus, add 1.25 cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (2 cc. 
if the sample is sour) and mix thoroughly. Add 10 cc. of 95 per cent, 
alcohol by volume and mix well. Then add 20 cc. of washed ether 
and shake vigorously for 30 seconds; add 25 cc. petroleum ether 
(redistilled slowly at a temperature of below 60 C.) and shake again 
for 30 seconds. Let stand 20 minutes, or until the upper liquid is 
practically clear. Draw off as much as possible of the ether-fat solu- 
tion (usually 0.5 to 0.8 cc. will be left) into a weighed flask through a 
small, quick-acting filter. The flask should always be weighed with 
a similar one as a counterpoise. Re-extract the liquid remaining in 
the tube this time with only 15 cc. of each ether shake vigorously 
30 seconds with each and allow to settle. Draw off the clear solution 
through the small filter with a few cc. of a mixture of the two ethers in 
equal parts. For absolutely exact results, the re-extraction must be 
repeated. This third extraction yields usually not more than about 
1 mg. of fat (about 0.02 per cent, on a 4 gram charge) if the previous 
ether-fat solutions have been drawn off closely. Evaporate the ethers 
slowly on a steam bath, then dry the fat in a boiling water oven to 
constant weight. 

Confirm the purity of the fat by dissolving in a little petroleum 
ether. Should a residue remain, remove the fat completely with 
petroleum ether, dry the residue, weigh, and deduct the weight. 
Finally, correct this weight by a blank determination on the reagents 
used. 

If Rohrig tubes are not obtainable, a 100 cc. burette may be used 
and the ether solution of fat carefully removed with a pipette. Care 
should be taken to remove all the fat from the pipette with a little 
of the ether and collect same in the flask after passing through the 
filter.

may be inoculated with certain bacteria and produce either dextro- 
or levo-rotatory lactic acid. A number of anaerobic bacteria will 
produce butyric fermentation in milk. Alcoholic fermentation is also 
produced in milk in the manufacture of kumiss, either from mare's 
or cow's milk. 

Milk sugar, when acted upon by either mineral acids or by an enzyme 
that causes the same action as the acid, will be transformed into 
dextrose and galactose according to the equation : 

Ci 2 H 22 On + H 2 = C 6 H 12 6 + C 6 H 12 6 . 

Lactose Dextrose Galactose 

In the manufacture of milk sugar the whey is concentrated in vacuum 
pans until it contains about 60 per cent, of sugar; then cooled to 20 C. 
and let stand 24 hours, when the crystals separate, with an oily layer 
above. To the crystalline mass a small amount of cold water is 
added and by centrifuging the crystals are retained in the drum of the 
centrifuge by means of a cloth. The sugar should be about 88 per 
cent, pure and represent 3.6 to 4.3 per cent, of the whey taken. By 
concentrating the liquid from which the first crop of crystals are taken, 
another crop of crystals may be obtained. 

The sugar is refined by dissolving in water and adding bone black 
to decolorize, and about 0.2 per cent, of acetic acid to coagulate the 
albumin. It is then heated to near boiling for a few minutes, filtered, 
the filtrate concentrated in vacuo and the sugar removed by centri- 
fuging. 

The specific rotation (O)D of sugar of milk, determined at 25 C., 
in a solution in distilled water containing in 100 cc. the equivalent of 
10 grams, and using a 200 mm. tube is from + 52.2 to + 52.5.

ing solution) to a 400 cc. beaker and addSOcc. of reducing sugar solution, 
prepared as above, or, if a smaller volume of sugar solution is used, 
add water in either case to make the final volume exactly 100 cc. 
Heat the beaker on an asbestos gauze over a Bunsen burner, regulating 
the flame so that the boiling begins in 4 minutes, and continue the 
boiling for exactly 2 minutes. Keep the beaker covered with a watch 
glass during the heating. Filter the cuprous oxide at once on an

asbestos mat in a porcelain Gooch crucible, using suction. Wash the 
cuprous oxide thoroughly with hot water (temperature 60 C.). Wash 
the asbestos film and adhering cuprous oxide into a beaker by means 
of dilute nitric acid. After the copper is all in solution, refilter through 
a thin film of asbestos in a Gooch and wash thoroughly with hot water. 
Add 10 cc. of sulphuric acid (1-4), and evaporate the filtrate on a 
steam bath until the copper salt has largely crystallized. Heat 
carefully on a hot plate, or over asbestos, until evolution of white 
fumes shows that excess of nitric acid is removed. Add 8 to 10 drops 
of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and rinse into a 100 to 125 cc. platinum dish. 
Deposit the copper by electrolysis. Wash the deposit thoroughly 
with water; then break the current, wash with alcohol and ether suc- 
cessively, dry at about 50 C., and weigh. If preferred, the electrolysis 
can be conducted in a beaker, the copper being deposited upon a 
weighed platinum electrode. 

The weight of lactose from 1.25 grams of milk (the amount used 
in the determination) is found by obtaining its equivalent to the 
weight of copper obtained, by reference to Munson and Walker's 
Tables. Multiply by 80 to ascertain the percentage of lactose. 

For the electric current, two ordinary crowfoot gravity cells are 
sufficient. Connect the negative electrode (the zinc) with the plati- 
num dish and a spiral platinum wire leading from the copper of the 
second cell will serve as the positive electrode. The spiral wire (posi- 
tive electrode) is suspended in the solution so that it does not come in 
contact with the platinum dish. If a glass beaker is used in place of the 
platinum dish, a platinum foil is used as the negative electrode. 
Water should be added until the foil is covered. Allow the solution 
to stand 4 to 6 hours. The electric current passing through the 
solution decomposes the copper sulphate and the copper is deposited 
on the negative electrode. When the solution becomes colorless, a 
drop should be removed and tested for copper by bringing it in con- 
tact with a drop of potassium ferrocyanide solution on a porcelain 
dish. If no coloration is produced, the negative electrode, containing 
the copper, is washed quickly before breaking the current. If the 
negative electrode is left in the liquid after the current is broken, the 
acid solution will begin to dissolve the copper from the electrode. 

Very good results are obtained by weighing the reduced copper as 
cuprous oxide and obtaining the equivalent of lactose by reference to 
Munson and Walker's Tables. In this case, after washing the re- 
duced copper on the Gooch, it is thoroughly washed with hot water 
and then with 10 cc. of alcohol and finally with 10 cc. of ether, and 
dried for 30 minutes at a temperature not to exceed 100 C. Cool in 
a desiccator and weigh.

The A.O.A.C. Optical Method for the Determination of Lactose in 
Milk is as follows : 

REAGENTS. 

(a) Add Mercuric Nitrate Solution. Dissolve mercury in double its weight of 
nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and dilute with an equal volume of water. 

(6) Mercuric Iodide Solution. Dissolve 33.2 grams of potassium iodide and 13.5 
grams of mercuric chloride in 20 cc. of glacial acetic acid and 640 cc. of water.

DETERMINATION. 

Determine the specific gravity of the milk by means of a delicate hydrometer, 
if preferred, a pycnometer. The quantity of sample to be taken for the determina- 
tion varies with the specific gravity and is to be measured at the same temperature 
at which the specific gravity is taken. The volume to be measured will be found in 
the table following, which is based upon twice the normal weight of lactose (32.9 
grams per 100 metric cc.) for the Ventzke sugar scale. 

Place the quantity of milk indicated in a flask graduated at 102.6 cc. Add 1 cc. 
of the acid mercuric nitrate solution, or 30 cc. of the mercuric iodide solution (an 
excess of these reagents does no harm), fill to the mark, shake, filter through a dry 
filter and polarize. It is not necessary to heat before polarizing. If a 200 mm. tube 
is used,, divide the polariscope reading by 2 (or, if a 400 mm. tube is used, by 4) to 
obtain the per cent, of lactose in the sample.

Casein. Casein occurs in milk as a calcium salt in proportion of 100 
casein to 1.55 CaO, and is present in colloidal form. 

Jorgensen 1 states that when milk sours the lactic acid formed by 
the action of lactic acid bacteria acting upon lactose at a temperature 
of 30-35 C., combines with the calcium salt of the milk, liberating 
casein, in which it is in combination the casein being precipitated in 
a fine flocculent condition, causing the curdling of milk. In addition 
to the casein, a greyish-yellow serum separates out, containing calcium 
lactate, lactose, albumin, etc. 

The percentage of casein as well as fat varies in milk among animals 
of different breeds as well as among animals of the same breed, as the 
following analyses will indicate. The average is given for a number 
of cows of each breed. 

Although casein is a by-product of the dairy industry, it is the second 
chief product of milk.

Casein is prepared for technical purposes by heating skim milk to 
about 35 C. in a cheese vat and then treating with crude hydrochloric 
acid which curdles the milk. The whey is then drawn off and the 
curd spead on sloping tables to cool. It is then washed in a spray of 
cold water, or churned with water. The water is removed by pressing 
the curd in sacks and then drying. 

Casein is extensively used in the manufacture of paints used for 
different purposes, such as water-proofing playing cards, for marking 
purposes and for calcimining. It is also used in the manufacture of 
casein-cement paint; for making a boiled oil substitute; in the textile 
industry; in paper making; in the manufacture of egg substitutes, 
and for many other purposes. 

A number of methods for the determination of casein in milk have 
been proposed, as Van Slyke and Bosworth's, 3 Arny and Schaefer's, 4 
Walker's, 5 all volumetric; and Robertson's, 6 by the refractometer. 

Walker's method is as follows : 10 cc. of milk are transferred by means 
of a pipette to a porcelain casserole. A fairly large quantity of 
phenolphthalein solution (about 1 cc. of a one-per cent, solution) is 
added. N/9 alkali is run in with constant stirring until a fairly deep 
pink color is produced. Next add 2 cc. of a neutral solution of for- 
maldehyde. The pink color disappears. N/9 alkali is again added 
until the pink color returns. The reading of the burette is taken the 
difference of the two readings being the amount of alkali used in the 
second titration. From this amount calculate the percentage of 
casein on the basis of 1 cc. N/9 alkali = 1.63 per cent, casein. 

The formaldehyde (commercial 40 per cent.) solution should be 
neutralized with the alkali immediately before using. 

Van Slyke's Method. 7 Now official A.O.A.C. method. Place 10 grams of the

per cent, acetic acid. Stir and let stand three to five minutes. Then decant on a 
filter, wash by decantation two or three times with cold water and transfer the pre- 
cipitate to the filter. Wash once or twice on the filter. The filtrate should be clear, 
or very nearly so. If the first portions of the filtrate are not clear, repeat the filtra- 
tion, after which complete the washing of the precipitate. Determine the nitrogen in 
the washed precipitate and filter paper by the Gunning method. Multiply the 
nitrogen by 6.38 and calculate the percentage of casein.

PRESERVATIVES. 

Many substances have been used to a more or less extent as pre- 
servatives for milk. A few have been advertised to be of such a 
nature that they could not be detected by chemists. However, such 
preparations or substances have generally proven to be nitrates or 
nitrites in some form, and occasionally hydrogen peroxide. 

The following preservatives will be briefly considered: 

Benzoates. 

Borates. 

Carbonates. 

Formaldehyde. 

Hydrogen peroxide. 

Nitrates and nitrites. 

Salicylates. 

Benzoates. "Accoine" 1 consists of an aqueous solution containing

208 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

13.97 per cent, of sodium benzoate and 1.94 per cent, of sodium 
carbonate. It is claimed for this preparation that it cannot be de- 
tected by analysis. 

Benzoic acid as benzoates in mixtures as "accoine," or in any form, 
may be detected as follows: Acidify 100 cc. of the milk with 5 cc. 
hydrochloric acid (1 to 3), shake until curdled and filter. Extract 
the filtrate with ether. Evaporate the ether at a low temperature 
and add water, made alkaline with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, 
to the residue. Evaporate to dryness. To the residue add 5 to 10 
drops concentrated sulphuric acid and a small crystal of potassium 
nitrate. Heat for 10 minutes in an oil bath at not to exceed 130 C., 
or for 20 minutes on a boiling water bath. After cooling, add water 
and make distinctly ammoniacal. Boil the solution to decompose 
any ammonium nitrite which may have been formed. Cool and add 
a drop of fresh, colorless ammonium sulphide, without allowing the 
layers to mix. A red brown ring indicates benzoic acid. 

Borates or Boric Acid. Add dilute hydrochloric acid to the ash and 
saturate tumeric paper in the solution. The tumeric paper, when 
dried, will turn cherry red if boric acid is present. 

Differentiation Between Boric Acid and Borates. Add a few cc. of 
alcohol to the ash and ignite. The alcohol will burn with a green 
flame if boric acid is present, but the green tinge is not given with 
borates. Cool and add two or three drops of sulphuric acid to the 
ash and again add a few cc. of alcohol and ignite. In case borates 
are present the flame will now be tinged green. 

Carbonates or Bicarbonates would be indicated in case of effer- 
vescence when hydrochloric acid is added to the ash. 

Formaldehyde is detected by diluting 10 cc. of milk in a test tube 
with 20 cc. of water, and running down the inside of the tube about 
5 cc. commercial sulphuric acid, forming a layer under the diluted 
milk. A violet blue zone is produced at the junction of the two strata 
if formaldehyde is present. 

This is known as Hehner's 1 sulphuric acid test, and the reaction 
will not be produced if pure acid is used a trace of ferric or platinic 
chloride should be present in the reagent. 

Leonard 2 states: "It would therefore appear that the presence of a 
feeble oxidizing agent, such as a metallic perchloride, is necessary for 
the production of Hehner's reaction. The test is not improved by 
the addition of any considerable amount of ferric chloride, but rather 
the reverse. A trace only is necessary and sufficient."

When the fat in milk is determined by the Babcock method, the 
reaction for formaldehyde takes place when the commercial sulphuric 
acid is added to the milk to dissolve the casein. If formaldehyde is 
present the violet-blue zone will be observed before the acid and 
milk are mixed. 

Determination of Formaldehyde. In the quantitative determina- 
tion of formaldehyde in milk it is essential to separate the formal- 
dehyde by distillation before the determination is made. The per- 
centage of formaldehyde that may be recovered in different fractions 
has been investigated by Smith 1 and his conclusions are as follows: 
A Kjeldahl flask should be used in making the distillations. This 
will save time and trouble from frothing and bumping. Sulphuric 
acid should be added to the milk before distillation, and it should be of 
a dilution of 1 : 3 of distilled water. Exactly 1 cc. of the diluted acid 
should be added to 100 cc. of milk. The first 20 cc. of the distillate will 
contain very close to 33| per cent, of the total formaldehyde present. 

Many methods have been proposed for the quantitative estimation 
of formaldehyde in solution. The Blank and Finkenbeiner Method is 
official in the United States Pharmacopoeia. In this method the 
formaldehyde is oxidized to formic acid by hydrogen peroxide which 
is neutralized by normal alkali and the excess of added alkali de- 
termined. The reaction is represented by the following equation: 

H 2 2 + CH 2 + KOH = KOOCH + 2H 2 0. 

The details as given by the Pharmacopoeia follow: 

Transfer 3 cc. of solution of formaldehyde to a tared flask con- 
taining 10 cc. of distilled water, tightly stopper and weigh accurately. 
Add to the contents of the flask 50 cc. of normal potassium hydroxide 
V.S. and follow this immediately but slowly, through a small funnel, 
with 50 cc. of solution of hydrogen dioxide which has previously been 
rendered neutral to litmus with potassium hydroxide. Now heat the 
mixture cautiously on a water bath for five minutes, shaking oc- 
casionally during this time; allow to cool; rinse the funnel and sides 
of the flask with distilled water, and, after allowing it to stand thirty 
minutes, titrate with normal sulphuric acid V.S., using litmus T.S. as 
indicator. 

Each cc. of normal potassium hydroxide V.S. corresponds to 0.03002 
gin. of CH 2 0. 

In case of dilute solution of formaldehyde it is advisable to use more 
than 3 cc. In case of milk the first 20 cc. distillate from 100 cc. of 
milk should be used. 

1 J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1903, 25, 1038. 



210 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The Legler method 1 for the determination of formaldehyde is 
claimed to give good results with solutions containing 5 per cent, or 
over of formaldehyde. Normal ammonia is added to form hexa- 
methylenetetramine which is represented by the following reaction : 

6CH 2 O + 4NH 3 = (CH 2 ) 6 N 4 + 6H 2 0. 

The excess of ammonia is determined, using rosalic acid as indicator. 

A gravimetric method has been proposed by adding an excess of 
ammonia, evaporating to dryness, and weighing the hexamethylene- 
tetramine. This method gives low results owing to loss of hexa- 
methylenetetramine in drying. 

The iodiometric, potassium cyanide and aniline volumetric methods 
have been proposed by different authors. 

The iodiometric method depends upon the following reaction: 

CH 2 + 21 + 2NaOH = 2NaI + CHOOH + H 2 0. 

The potassium cyanide method depends upon the fact that for- 
maldehyde combines with potassium cyanide, forming an additional 
product, thus: 

H 

I 
CH 2 + KCN = N = C-C-0-K. 

I 
H 

In the aniline volumetric method methylene aniline is formed and 
precipitates. It is represented as follows : 

C 6 H 5 NH 2 + CH 2 = C 6 H 5 NCH 2 + H 2 O. 

See Smith's article above referred to for details of all of these methods 
for the determination of formaldehyde. 

Munget and Marion 2 detect formaldehyde in milk by sifting amidol 
on the surface of the milk. After a few minutes, if formaldehyde is 
present, a characteristic canary-yellow color is produced. This color 
should not be confused with the salmon color produced with normal 
milk. 

When amidol is added to jelly or preserved meats, if formaldehyde 
is present, a yellow color is formed, which changes to a dirty yellow 
on the addition of ammonium hydroxide. Jelly free from formal-

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 211 

dehyde gives a rose-brown color, changing to blue when treated with 
amidol. 

Hydrogen Peroxide. Darlington 1 experimented with a number of 
reagents for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in milk and found that 
paraphenylene-diamine gave the best results. Add a 2 per cent, 
aqueous solution of paraphenylene-diamine to 10 cc. of the sample 
and if hydrogen peroxide is present a blue color develops. The pre- 
servative cannot be detected after 18 hours by this reagent. 

Nitrates, as potassium or sodium nitrate, have been used as a pre- 
servative, and also to remove the so-called turnip-like taste in milk. 2 
Nitrates may be detected in milk by the test given for their detection 
in watered milk. 

Nitrites. In England a milk preservative containing nitrites has 
been exploited under the name of "Mystin," 3 and advertised as 
possessing the advantage that its presence cannot be detected by 
analysis. An analysis of the preparation indicates the following 
composition : 

Sodium nitrite 9.85 per cent. 

Formaldehyde 0.30 " " 

Water 89.85 " " 

It is claimed that " Mystin" in the amount of 3 ounces to 17 gallons 
of milk, which is the prescribed proportion to use, will not respond to 
Hehner's test for formaldehyde owing to the action of nitrous acid 
with tryptophane, which is present among the products of hydrolysis 
of casein, rendering the tryptophane incapable of condensing with 
formaldehyde. 4 However, if the nitrous acid in the acidified milk be 
destroyed by some such substance as urea, the milk treated with 
"Mystin" yields the usual coloration with the Hehner test. Five cc. 
of the milk are treated with 0.05 gram of urea and 1 cc. normal sul- 
phuric acid. The mixture should be heated two minutes in a boiling 
water bath, then cooled before applying the test. 

The Griess-Ilosvay test would detect " Mystin" or other nitrites in 
milk. The test should be applied as follows: Five cc. of milk are 
placed in a test tube and 3 cc. of the reagent 5 added. The color pro-

Analyst, 1912, 37, 155. 

6 Note: The Griess-Ilosvay reagent is prepared as follows: 0.1 gram of a-naphthyla- 
mine is dissolved in 20 cc. of glacial acetic acid and mixed with 0.5 gram sulphanilic 
acid dissolved in 150 cc. of warm, 6-per cent, acetic acid the whole being diluted to 
300 cc. with more 6-per cent, acetic acid and finally add 150 cc. of 60-per cent, 
acetic acid.

duced is matched with standard solutions of nitrites in Nessler cyl- 
inders, or, better still, by the use of a colorimeter and a standard 
solution. 

Stockes 1 adopted the methods following for the detection of nitrites 
and formaldehyde in milk. The tests are claimed to be sensitive in 
the detection of "Mystin" when only two drops are present in 100 cc. 
of milk. 

(a) A portion of the milk is coagulated with dilute sulphuric acid, 
filtered, and a solution of diphenylamine in sulphuric acid added to 
the clear filtrate. The formation of a deep blue color shows the pres- 
ence of nitrite (or nitrate). 

(6) One hundred cc. of the milk are acidified with 5 cc. of strong 
phosphoric acid and distilled in a current of steam; about 10 cc. are 
distilled into an equal volume of Schiff s reagent; 2 if a pink coloration 
develops within five minutes the presence of formaldehyde is indicated. 

Salicylates would be detected by the same method used for benzoic 
acid, except that the ether residue should be dissolved in water, and a 
drop of ferric chloride added which would indicate salicylic acid if a 
violet color is produced.

Blyth 2 gives a general method of detecting artificial coloring in 
milk as follows: 

Take 50 cc. or more of the milk (as much as can be spared if reduction products 
are specially looked for) and render it just alkaline to delicate litmus paper; evaporate 
to a paste, and thoroughly extract the fat with ether. Although turmeric, annatto, 
and such dyes as aniline yellow are all somewhat soluble in ether from an alkaline 
solution, yet in the presence of casein such small quantities are dissolved that they 
may be disregarded. (Phosphine is much more soluble in ether and should be 
looked for both in the ether and alcohol extract.) Evaporate the ethereal solution 
to dryness, shake up the fat with a small quantity of hot, distilled water in a small 
separating funnel, separate the water from the fat and evaporate to dryness on the 
water bath in a small flat porcelain dish. Carefully note the color of the residue (see 
Table). Pure milk will give no colored residue. Next, thoroughly exhaust the fat- 
free milk residue with absolute alcohol, pass the alcohol extract through a small 
filter, and evaporate to dryness in three or four small flat porcelain dishes; if un- 
reduced artificial coloring matter be present the residue will be colored orange, yellow, 
or brown. Wash one of the residues into a test tube with a small quantity of water 
made acid with sulphuric acid; the sulphonated azo dyes will be at once indicated 
by the color of the solution. Shake the solution with ether; this will divide the color- 
ing matters into two groups, as in Table: the natural coloring matters and the non- 
sulphonated, acid coal-tar dyes, i.e., the dyes precipitated by Weingartner's 3 tannin 
reagent, being soluble in ether, while the basic dyes and sulphonated dyes are in- 
soluble in ether. 

(a) Alcoholic Extract Colored Orange, Yellow or Brown. Take up a portion of 
the residue with dilute sulphuric acid and shake with ether. 

The ether dissolves some of the coloring. The ether does not dissolve the coloring 

matter.

Special reactions : 

Annatto. (a) Take up the yellow alcohol residue with weak sodium hydroxide 
solution and dry a few drops on filter paper. An orange spot changed to pink by 
stannous chloride solution indicates annatto. 

(6) Dissolve the yellow alcohol residue in a little water, add a little alcohol and 
a few drops of ammonia; introduce a bundle of white cotton fibers and evaporate 
the liquid nearly to dryness on the water bath; wash the fiber, which will be yellow, 
and then immerse it in citric acid solution, when it will become pink, (c) The milk is 
rendered alkaline by acid sodium carbonate and a slip of filter paper allowed to 
soak in it all night. Annatto causes a reddish-yellow stain on the paper. 

Tumeric. To the alcoholic residue add a little water and boric 
acid and evaporate to dryness on a water bath, with a piece of filter 
paper. If tumeric is present, the filter paper will have a characteristic 
red color, which turns greenish when treated with ammonia or a fixed 
alkali. 

Sour Milk. The action of decomposing milk on coal-tar dyes is 
exactly the same as is the action of zinc dust and hydrochloric acid. 



216 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Methyl orange breaks up into para-diamido-benzene and sulphanilic 
acid, and Orange IV yields para-amido-diphenylamine. To detect 
methyl orange in sour milk, extract with ether, evaporate the ether 
xtract and separate the fat by adding warm distilled water and filter- 
ing. To the filtrate add two drops of normal sulphuric acid, two drops 
of saturated sulphuretted hydrogen solution, and two drops of very 
dilute ferric chloride solution; on warming, methylene blue will be 
formed if the milk contained methyl orange. 

The residue extract, in case of Orange IV, will give, with a drop of 
ferric chloride, an intense, blue-green color, which changes to scarlet 
with strong sulphuric acid. 

Acidity of Milk. Wiley, Van Slyke, Hopkins and Powers, as well 
as others, have investigated the acidity of milk to a considerable extent. 

Wiley 1 states that normal fresh milk has an amphoteric reaction, 
that is, it will redden blue and blue red litmus paper. This is due to 
the presence in milk of both neutral and acid phosphates of the al- 
kalies the acid phosphates reacting acid and the saturated alkaline 
phosphates reacting blue. Wiley further states that if fresh milk is 
boiled to expel the carbon dioxide the reaction will then become 
alkaline. 

Hopkins and Powers, 2 after a series of experiments, published the 
following statements : 

" Too high results are obtained (a) by direct titration of milk without 
dilution; (6) by titration after simply diluting with cold or even with 
hot water; (c) by titration with the use of the small quantities of 
indicator that are ordinarily employed in volumetric work. 

" Too low results are obtained by precipitating the casein and titrat- 
ing (a) either an aliquot from the filtrate or (6) the entire filtrate and 
washings. 

" The following directions will determine very accurately the amount 
of acid in milk, giving sharp "end reactions" and uniform results: 
Take 20 cc. of milk, dilute to about 250 cc. with boiling water, and 
boil for one to two minutes; add about 2 cc. of a one-per cent, solution 
of phenolphthalein and titrate with standard alkali." 

Terry's Standard Method for Determining Milk Acidity. 8 Pipette 10 cc. of milk 
into an Erlenmeyer flask of about 100 cc. total capacity and add 5 drops of a one-per 
cent, alcoholic solution of phenolphthalein. Titrate slowly to the first noticeable 
pink tint that is permanent for one minute. This is to be determined by comparing 
with a flask of the same shape and capacity and containing the same amount of 
milk. N/10 NaOH is to be used in titration. The titration is to be performed only 
in daylight.

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 217 

1.00 cc. N/10 NaOH V.S. represents 10 degrees of acidity. 

Notes on the Method. 1 . The titrating flask should be dry or contain at the most 
only a couple of drops of water. 

2. Exactly 5 drops of the indicator should be used as it has been shown that this 
effects the titration. 

3. The NaOH solution should be N/10 and should be as free as possible from 
carbonates, but should not be prepared by using barium hydroxide. It is preferably 
standardized against purified potassium bitartrate as described in the United States 
Pharmacopoeia IX. 

4. This concentration of alkali and milk and the conditions named gives the best 
end-point excepting oxalated milk, 1 so that nothing is gained by using a larger 
volume of milk. Some writers recommend 50 or 100 cc. of milk as a sample and 
titrate with N/10 NaOH. This large volume of milk renders the color changes so 
sluggish that a definite end-point cannot be noticed. This same drop-wise effect 
can be produced by using 25 cc. of milk and N/4 NaOH, or 100 cc. of milk and N/l 
NaOH, but the results are not the same as with 10 cc. of milk and N/10 NaOH. 

5. The Author uses for these determinations an especially constructed burette of 
5 cc. capacity. The graduated part of the burette is about 230 mm. in length so 
that a reading of 0.02 cc. can be made with accuracy. The burette delivers 5 drops 
to the 0.10 cc. This type of burette is strongly recommended and it may be con- 
structed from a graduated pipette. It is filled from the bottom by applying suction 
to a rubber tube attached to the top. 

6. One must not confuse an acidity degree as determined by this method with the 
Soxhlet-Henkel degree referred to principally in German literature. This German 
degree is two and one half times as great. Quite often dairymen determine milk 
acidity as lactic acid 10 cc. of milk titrated with N/10 NaOH and the result multi- 
plied by 0.9. As the acidity of fresh milk is not due to lactic acid, but principally 
to acid phosphates, this degree is confusing and should be discontinued.

CONDENSED MILK AND CONDENSED MILK PRODUCTS. 

According to Food Inspection Decision No. 158, the Federal stand- 
ard for condensed milk is as follows : 

Condensed Milk, Evaporated Milk, Concentrated Milk is the product resulting from 
the evaporation of a considerable portion of the water from the whole, fresh, clean, 
lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking of one or more healthy cows, 
properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained within fifteen days before and ten 
days after calving, and contains, all tolerances being allowed for, not less than twenty- 
five and five-tenths per cent. (25.5) of total solids and not less than seven and eight- 
tenths per cent. (7.8) of milk fat. 

The Canadian 1 standard for condensed milk is "milk from which a 
considerable portion of water has been evaporated, and to which 
sugar has been added. It contains not less than 28 per cent, of milk 
solids, and not less than 7.7 per cent, of milk fat." 

In the United States this would be called " sweetened condensed 
milk"; however, in Canada, the term " evaporated milk" is applied 
exclusively to the unsweetened product, which should contain 26 per 
cent, of solids and not less than 7.2 per cent, of fat. 2 

The Ohio standard for condensed milk is somewhat different from 
the Federal, and is as follows: Condensed milk must be made from 
pure, clean, fresh, healthy, unadulterated and wholesome milk, from 
which cream has not been removed and in which the proportion of 
milk solids shall be equivalent to twelve per cent, of milk solids in 
crude milk, twenty-five per cent, of such solids being fat. 

Standards and definitions for condensed milk products, as given in 
Food Inspection Decision 170, follow: 

Sweetened Condensed Milk, Sweetened Evaporated Milk, Sweetened Concentrated 
Milk is the product resulting from the evaporation of a considerable portion of the 
water from the whole, fresh, clean, lacteal secretion obtained by the complete milking 
of one or more cows, properly fed and kept, excluding that obtained within fifteen 
days before and ten days after calving, to which sugar (sucrose) has been added.

Dried Milk is the product resulting from the removal of water from milk, and 
contains, all tolerances being allowed for, not less than twenty-six per cent. (26.0%) 
of milk fat, and not more than five per cent. (5.0%) of moisture. 

Dried Skimmed Milk is the product resulting from the removal of water from 
skimmed milk and contains, all tolerances allowed for, not more than five per cent. 
(5.0%) of moisture. 

Malted Milk is the product made by combining whole milk with the liquid sep- 
arated from a mash of ground barley malt and wheat flour, with or without the addi- 
tion of sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, and potassium bicarbonate in such a 
manner as to secure the full enzymic action of the malt extract, and by removing 
water. The resulting product contains not less than seven and one-half per cent. 
(7.50%) of butter fat, and not more than three and one-half (3.50%) of moisture. 



Methods of Analysis of Condensed Milk. 

Preparation of the Sample. Transfer the contents of the can to a 
porcelain evaporating dish and mix thoroughly. Weigh exactly 40 
grams and transfer to a 100 cc. sugar flask and make up to the 100 cc. 
mark with distilled water. 

Total Solids. Dilute 25 cc. of the 40-per cent, solution with an 
equal amount of water and use 5 cc., equal to 1 gram, for the de- 
termination of solids. Dry in a flat-bottomed platinum pan in a 
water bath or electric oven at a temperature not to exceed 100 C. 
to a constant weight. Multiply the weight of the solids thus obtained 
by 100 to obtain the percentage by weight. 

Ash is obtained by incinerating the solids until a perfectly white 
ash is produced. 

Lactose is determined the same as in milk 25 grams of the 40-per 
cent, solution is further diluted the same as if it was whole milk. The 
sucrose found multiplied by 200 will equal the percentage. 

Fat. The fat may be determined the same as in whole milk or by 
the following methods : 

Double Extracting Method 1 as follows: Make a paper coil same as 
in Adams' method and carefully drop on same 5 cc. of the 40-per cent, 
solution. Dry the coil at the temperature of boiling water. The 
coil is then placed in a Knorr extracting apparatus and extracted with 
ether for three hours or longer. Remove the paper coil and dry, 
which will take only a few minutes, to free from ether. Next soak the 
dried paper coil in a dish containing 500 cc. of distilled water for two 
or three hours; dry the coil at 100 C. and re-extract with ether for 
three or four hours. Make both extractings in the same Knorr or 
Sy flask and then evaporate the ether on a water bath; dry in water 
bath oven at the temperature of boiling water for 30 minutes, cool 
and weigh. Multiply the weight of fat obtained by 50 and the result

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 229 

will equal the percentage of fat in the condensed milk. With un- 
sweetened, condensed milk the first extraction removes, generally, 
within 0.3 to 0.4 per cent, of the total fat. 

Modification of Leffman and Beam Method. Transfer 15 cc. (equal 
to 6 grams) of the 40-per cent, solution to a Babcock cream bottle and 
add 4 cc. of a mixture of equal parts of amyl alcohol and hydrochloric 
acid, mix, let stand 5 minutes, and then add 10 cc. of sulphuric acid, 
specific gravity 1.84. Shake into solution and fill the bottle with 
50-per cent, sulphuric acid, recently made so it is still hot. Let stand 
one minute and then centrifuge three minutes. Place the bottle in 
hot water at 82 C. for 15 minutes and then read the amount of fat. 
Multiply the reading by 3 and the result will equal the percentage of 
fat. 

Leach 1 applies the Babcock milk method in the determination of 
fat in condensed milk by using 15 cc. (equal to 6 grams) of the 40-per 
cent, solution and the usual amount of sulphuric acid. The amount 
of fat found, multiplied by 3, will give the percentage of fat in the 
sample. 

Fat may be determined by the Roese-Gottleib method, the same as 
in sweetened condensed milk. 

Proteins. Place 5 cc. of the 40-per cent, solution in a 550 cc. 
Kjeldahl flask (used for both digestion and distillation) and add 10 
grams of potassium sulphate and 20 cc. of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. The determination is continued according to the regular 
Gunning method. Calculate the amount of nitrogen from the sample 
which was equal to 2 grams; multiply by 50, and that product by 6.38 
to obtain the percentage of protein. 

Coloring. Added coloring would be detected the same as in un- 
condensed milk. The same would apply to preservatives. 

Gelatin would be detected the same as in cream. 

Sweetened Condensed Milk. The sample is prepared by warming 
the can in water at 30 C. to 35 C. Open the can, scrape out all 
the milk adhering to the interior into a dish sufficiently jlarge, and 
stir the whole into a homogeneous mass. Weigh 100 grams into a 
500 cc. flask and make up to the mark with distilled water. 

Solids. The solids are determined by using 10 cc. of the 20-per 
cent, solution (equal to 2 grams) ; weighing and drying as directed in 
the determination of solids in milk. To obtain the percentage multiply 
the weight of the solids by 50. 

Ash. Incinerate the solids to obtain the ash. 

Protein. Use 10 cc. of the 20-per cent, solution and determine the 
nitrogen according to the Gunning method, the same as in milk. 
Multiply the nitrogen by 6.38 to obtain the protein.

230 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Lactose. Dilute 100 cc. of the 20-per cent, solution in a 250 cc. 
flask to about 200 cc., add 6 cc. of Fehling's copper sulphate solution 
and make up to the mark with distilled water. Filter through a dry 
filter and determine the milk sugar in 50 cc. of the solution, the same 
as in unsweetened condensed milk. 

Sucrose is generally estimated by difference, as "the solids + protein 
+ fat + ash, from total solids, equals sucrose." If desired, the sucrose 
may be determined by inversion. After inversion, the total reducing 
sugars are determined by Munson and Walker's method and the 
amount of lactose, previously determined, deducted. The difference 
will represent the invert sugar produced from the sucrose. The 
amount multiplied by 95 will equal the added sucrose. 

Fat: Roese-Gottlieb Method. Weigh 4 to 5 grams of the homo- 
geneous sample into a Rohrig tube, dilute with water to about 10.5 cc. 
and proceed as directed under the determination of fat in milk by the 
Roese-Gottlieb method. 

Below are given the results of the analyses of a few samples of evap- 
orated milk.

Filled Evaporated or Condensed Milk. There is being sold upon 
the market what might properly be branded a filled evaporated milk, 
as the butter fat has been removed and the skimmed milk incorporated 
with other fat. In samples of this nature, in addition to the de- 
terminations given above, it is necessary to determine the nature of the 
fat. To procure a sufficient quantity of the fat for the tests all that 
is required is to run a few bottles of the undiluted milk according to 
the Babcock method of determining fat in condensed milk and remove 
the fat from the test bottles with a pipette. The Reichert-Meissl 
number and the iodine number should be applied to the fat, which will 
generally be sufficient to determine whether the fat is butter fat or a 
substitute. 

A typical analysis of milk of this nature is as follows :

The analysis of this sample would indicate the filler to be cocoanut

Powdered or Dried Milk : Milk Powders. Powdered milk is pre- 
pared by evaporating milk to dryness in a revolving cylinder, heated 
to 110 C., or by spraying the milk into a chamber through which 
hot air is forced. Milk in this form is suitable to use by those journey- 
ing where ordinary milk is not obtainable. It is used on sea-going 
vessels which are supplied with machinery for reconstituting milk 
from the powdered form in such manner that it is difficult to dis- 
tinguish it from ordinary milk. 

During times of milk shortage or high price, considerable quantity 
of dried milk is "emulsified" or "homogenized" and sold as fresh 
milk. This practice should be condemned as it is questionable as to 
the dietetic properties of such milk for infants and invalids.

Richmond states: "On shaking the solid residue obtained by drying milk on the 
water bath, in which milk sugar certainly exists as anhydrous sugar, with water, a 
rise of temperature always takes place; anhydrous milk sugar mixed with water 
always causes a rise in temperature, whilst hydrated milk sugar causes a fall of 0.55 
if more than can be at once dissolved is added. The milk powders examined, with 
one exception (No. 2), all caused a fall in temperature, and it is seen that the addition 
of the water of hydration to the total gives figures which are but slightly in excess of

100 per cent. Both the change of temperature and the slight excess over 100 per 
cent, indicate that the bulk of the milk sugar, though not all, exists as hydrated 
sugar." 

Saccharate of lime, sodium phosphate and other alkaline substances 
are added to milk powders to increase their solubility. 

Federal notices of judgment indicate that powdered milk is most 
frequently adulterated by the substitution of powdered skimmed 
milk. 

Analysis of Powdered Milk. In the analysis of powdered milk the 
regular methods of analysis of milk products should be modified to a 
certain extent. 

The following methods are given by Fleming. 1 

Moisture. In the determination of moisture the constituents are 
liable to become oxidized and the weight increased if the drying is 
continued long. About ten hours on the water bath is sufficient. 

Milk Sugar is determined gravimetrically by weighing out in a 
small beaker 2j grams of the milk powder. Add a little warm water 
at about 50 C.; stir to a smooth paste; then add more warm water to 
make about 400 cc. Shake thoroughly and then cool and add sufficient 
water to make 500 cc. Add 10 cc. Fehling's copper sulphate solution 
and continue the determination as given under "Milk." 

Cane Sugar. In a 250 cc. Erlenmeyer flask place 50 cc. of the 
sugar solution prepared as for milk sugar determination by precipitat- 
ing proteins, etc., with copper sulphate and carefully neutralizing. 
Add 0.5 gram of citric acid. Boil with reflux condenser for 35 minutes, 
neutralize and determine the reducing power of the solution by the 
same method as for milk sugar, adding the boiling Fehling solution 
directly to the flask containing the sugar solution. From the weight 
of the copper found, subtract the amount found in the previous de- 
termination for milk sugar; the difference represents the inverted 
sucrose. 

Casein. To 50 cc. of a 10-per cent, solution of milk poWer at 40 
C., add 2 cc. of warm saturated solution of potassium alum. Allow to 
settle; filter on a large filter paper (15 cm.); wash and transfer filter 
paper and precipitate into a Kjeldahl flask and continue the operation 
the same as in the determination of nitrogen. 

Fat. Richmond 2 prefers the Roese-Gottlieb method as follows : 0.5 to 
0.7 grams of the dry milk is weighed into a narrow stoppered cylinder 
holding about 50 cc. and sufficient water added to make a weight of 
5.1 grams; 0.5 cc. of ammonia solution (0.88 ammonia diluted with 

1 J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 1912, 4, 543.

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 235 

an equal bulk of water) is measured in and the dry milk dissolved by 
shaking, and, if necessary, slight warming; 5 cc. of alcohol are added 
and the mixture shaken until homogeneous. 12.5 cc. of ether are 
poured in and the contents of the tube well mixed the thorough 
mixing at this stage being a most important detail. Finally 12.5 cc. 
of petroleum ether (boiling point below 60 C.) are added, and the 
contents of the tube again thoroughly mixed two or three times. 
Separation of the ethereal layer takes place rapidly, and when globules 
can no longer be detected in the lower layer, the upper layer is drawn 
off with wash-bottle tubes. By the addition of successive quantities 
of a mixture of ether and petroleum ether the whole fat is extracted. 
The solvent is evaporated and the residue weighed. 

It is more convenient to use a Rohrig tube in making this determina- 
tion. 

Redmond's 1 method for the determination of fat in milk powder by 
a modified Babcock method is claimed to give good results. The 
method is as follows : 

Weigh 2.5 grams of milk powder and transfer it to an ordinary Babcock milk 
bottle, graduated to 10 per cent. Add 31 cc. of dilute sulphuric acid (395 cc. con- 
centrated sulphuric acid diluted with water to 1 liter) and place the bottle upright 
in a dish of gently boiling water. Shake frequently and keep in the boiling water 
until the powder is dissolved and the solution is dark brown in color. This usually 
takes from seven to ten minutes. After removing the bottle from the water add 12 
cc. concentrated sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.82-1.83) and mix thoroughly, taking care to 
keep the solution out of the neck of the bottle. Agitate with a rotary motion. 
Place the bottle in a centrifuge and whirl for four or five minutes. Add hot water 
until the solution reaches the lower end of the neck; whirl again one minute. In 
order to secure accurate results, the fat column must be read at a temperature not 
above 60 C., nor below 54.4 C. By setting the bottle in water, the desired tempera- 
ture may be reached. The reading multiplied by 7.2 gives the percentage of fat.

CREAM. 

The Federal standard for cream according to Food Inspection De- 
cision 178 is as follows: 

Cream, Sweet Cream is that portion of milk, rich in milk fat, which rises to the 
surface of milk on standing, or is separated from it by centrifugal force. It is fresh 
and clean. It contains not less than eighteen per cent. (18%) of milk fat and not 
more than two-tenths per cent. (0.2%) of acid-reacting substances calculated in 
terms of lactic acid. 

Whipping Cream is cream which contains not less than thirty per cent. (30%) of 
milk fat. 

This standard for cream is certainly very low, as cream separated 
from milk by being allowed to set in pans will generally run above 
20 per cent, in fat, and if obtained by the use of a centrifugal separator 
it will contain from 30 to 40 per cent, of fat. 

Homogenized Milk or Homogenized Cream is milk or cream that has been mechani- 
cally treated in such a manner as to alter its physical properties, with particular 
reference to the condition and appearance of the fat globules. 

The following statement in reference to homogenized cream is made 
in the Federal Service and Regulatory Announcement No. 17: 

Homogenized Cream and Homogenized or Emulsified Mixtures in Semblance of 
Cream. The term "homogenized cream' ' can be applied properly only to genuine 
cream which has been subjected to a homogenizing process, whereby it is made to 
appear thicker; because of this change in appearance all homogenized cream should 
be labeled. 

The various emulsified mixtures which have more or less the semblance of cream, 
such as mixtures of butter or butter fat with skimmed milk or milk powder and water, 
or mixtures of heavy cream with milk powder and water, are neither '' cream" nor 
''homogenized cream," and cannot be legally sold in interstate commerce under either 
of these names. Since such products resemble genuine cream, they should, in the 
opinion of the Bureau, be labeled and sold under names making known their true 
nature. 

The analysis of nine commercial samples of cream gave the following 
results :

Analysis of Cream. 

The solids, ash and lactose of cream are determined the same as in 
milk. 

Fat. In the determination of fat only 4 or 5 grams are used and 
diluted with 10.5 cc. of water. The determination is made by the 
Roese-Gottlieb method, the same as in milk. 

If the Babcock method is used it should be modified as follows: 
Mix the sample thoroughly and weigh into a tared Babcock cream 
bottle, graduated to measure 30 per cent, of fat, about 10 grams. 
Add 6 or 7 cc. of water to the cream and then about 17.5 cc. of sulphuric 
acid, and continue the determination the same as for milk. 

To calculate the percentage of fat, multiply the reading of the fat 
by 18 and divide the product by the weight of the sample. 

Foreign fat in cream is detected by separating and determining 
the constants for butter fat. 

Preservatives and artificial color are detected the same as in milk. 

Gelatin. Stokes' 1 method of detecting gelatin in cream is as follows : 
Dissolve some mercury in twice its weight of strong nitric acid (specific 
gravity 1.42); dilute this with water to 25 times its bulk. To about 
10 cc. of this solution add a little quantity of the cream and about 
20 cc. of cold water. Shake the mixture vigorously, leave it for 
five minutes, then filter. If much gelatin be present it will be im- 
possible to get a clear filtrate. To the filtrate, or to a portion of it, 
add an equal bulk of a saturated aqueous solution of picric acid. If 
any gelatin be present a yellow precipitate will be immediately pro- 
duced. In case of sour cream, a precipitate will form owing to the 
presence of soluble decomposition products, and Seidenberg 2 determines 
the nature of the precipitate as follows : The solution and precipitate 
are shaken thoroughly and then allowed to stand some time. Most of 
the liquid can then be siphoned off. The precipitate is transferred to a

filter and washed with water containing two or three drops of ammon- 
ium hydroxide to 100 cc., until the washings are slightly alkaline to 
litmus. Next wash with water until the washings are neutral to lit- 
mus. The excess of picric acid will be thus removed. Transfer the 
precipitate to a small beaker and add 10 to 20 cc. distilled water and 
heat to boiling. Filter hot into a test tube. The filtrate will contain 
the gelatin picrate but not the precipitate derived from the proteids in 
the sour cream. Cool and add to the filtrate an equal volume of picric 
acid solution. A precipitate at this point indicates gelatin in the 
original cream.

ICE CREAM. 

The Federal standards 1 for ice cream are as follows : 

1. Ice Cream is a frozen product made from cream and sugar, with or without a 
natural flavoring, and contains not less than fourteen (14) per cent, of milk fat. 

2. Fruit Ice Cream is a frozen product made from cream, sugar, and sound, clean 
fruits, and contains not less than twelve (12) per cent, of milk fat. 

3. Nut Ice Cream is a frozen product made from cream, sugar, and sound, non- 
rancid nuts, and contains not less than twelve (12) per cent, of milk fat. 

In fat content the Canadian 2 standard for ice cream is the same as 
in the United States, but their definition for ice cream is somewhat 
different and will be given in full as follows : 

Ice Cream is a frozen product made from cream and sugar, with or without harm- 
less flavoring and coloring materials, and with or without gelatin, gum tragacanth, 
or other harmless stiffening materials, in amount less than two (2) per cent., and 
contains not less than fourteen (14) per cent, of milk fat. 

Analysis. 

In the analysis of ice cream the determinations are made the same 
as in other milk products, with the exception of the determination of 
the fat.

By consulting the bibliography it will be not'ced that there has been 
a number of methods proposed for the determination of fat in ice 
cream. It appears, however, that Utt's method is the most desirable 
as the familiar Babcock apparatus is used and the liability of error is 
to a great extent obviated on that account. 

Utt's Method. 1 Mix the sample by pouring and stirring, after 
warming to 40 C. 

Weigh 9 grams of the sample into a 10-per cent. Babcock milk bottle. Make a 
mixture of equal parts by volume of commercial sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.83) and 
glacial acetic acid. Cool; add 12 to 15 cc. of the acid mixture to the ice cream in the 
Babcock bottle; shake the mixture, using a rotary motion; place the bottle in a steam 
bath or hot water and heat with occasional shaking until it turns a dark chocolate 
color. Remove the bottle from the bath and cool for ten minutes. Place in the 
centrifuge and whirl for ten minutes. Shake the bottle again, using a whirling 
motion, and then fill to the neck with hot water and mix. If a precipitate forms, 
dissolve by adding a few cc. of the acid mixture. Whirl three minutes and add 
boiling water to bring the fat column into the neck of the bottle; whirl two minutes; 
make the reading, and multiply by 2 to obtain the percentage of fat. The reading 
should be made by holding the bottle in water at 55 C. 

The Roese-Gottlieb Method may be used for the determination of 
fat in ice cream as follows: Weigh from 3 to 5 grams of the homo- 
geneous sample into a Rohrig tube or similar apparatus, dilute with 
water to about 10.5 cc. and proceed as in the determination of con- 
densed milk. 

The frequency of the use of gelatin, starch, tragacanth, or other 
gums in the manufacture of ice cream is indicated by McGill. 2 The 
analysis of 64 samples resulted as follows : 

Samples containing no thickener 17 

" " starch only 7 

" " gelatin only 28 

gums only 2 

" gums and starch 2 

gums and gelatin 5 

starch and gelatin 2 

starch, gelatin and gum 1 

Total 64~ 

Gelatin may be detected by Stokes' method, as given under cream, 
and the starch is detected by the well-known iodine test.

HOMOGENIZED DAIRY PRODUCTS. 

Butter and vegetable oils are emulsified by simultaneously centri- 
fuging and aerating, or ozonizing, them, and then emulsifying them 
with milk or cream to form solid or liquid edible products. 

It is claimed that homogenized milk is more easily digested than 
whole milk, but this is questionable. 

The statement has been made that unprincipled dealers incorporate 
other than butter fat when homogenizing cream. 

Homogenized butter is prepared by incorporating one pound of 
butter with one pound of milk to make two pounds of butter. The 
product has all the appearance of butter, but upon analysis the adul- 
teration is easily detected by the low percentage of butter fat and the 
high percentage of water. 

In the analysis of homogenized products, especially cream and 
ice cream, the Babcock method as ordinarily applied does not give 
satisfactory results. Cobleigh 1 proposes the following modification of 
the Babcock method: The sample is weighed in a cream bottle in the 
usual way. To liberate the fat from the emulsion, add about one- 
half gram of borax and from five to ten cc. of ether, and centrifuge for 
two or three minutes. Let stand from three to four hours and then 
heat gently to volatilize the ether. Add sulphuric acid (sp. gr. 1.83) 
until the solution turns a light coffee color, and then proceed as in the 
usual Babcock method. 

BUTTER. 

The Federal standards for milk fat, butter fat and renovated butter 
are as fol ows: 

Milk Fat, Butter Fat is the fat of milk and has a Reichert-Meissl number not less 
than twenty-four (24) and a specific gravity not less than 0.905 (40 C./40 C.). 

1 Am. Food J., 1916, 11, 457. 



DAIRY PRODUCTS. 241 

Butter is the clean, non-rancid product made by gathering, in any manner, the 
fat of fresh or ripened milk or cream into a mass, which also contains a small portion 
of the other milk constituents, with or without salt, and contains not less than eighty- 
two and five-tenths (82.5) per cent, of milk fat. By Act of Congress approved 
August 2, 1886, and May 9, 1902, butter may also contain added coloring matter. 

Renovated Butter, Process Butter is the product made by melting butter and re- 
working, without the use of chemicals, or any substance except milk, cream or salt, 
and contains not more than sixteen (16) per cent, of water and at least eighty-two 
and five-tenths (82.5) per cent, of milk fat. 1

The ether number, or milligrams of potassium hydroxide necessary 
to saponify the neutral fat in one gram of sample, is obtained by sub- 
tracting the acid number from the saponification number. 

Analysis of Butter. 

In the analysis of butter, determinations should be made as follows : 

Water. 

Fat. 

Curd. 

Ash. 

Reichert-Meissl and Polenske value. 

Preservatives and coloring. 

Water. About two grams of butter are weighed into a platinum or 
other suitable pan (the same as is used in determin ng solids in milk), 
and dried at a temperature of boiling water until a constant weight is 
obtained. Calculate the percentage of water from the loss of weight in 
drying. 

Fat. Extract the fat, obtained in determining the water, with 
anhydrous, alcohol-free ether or chloroform, and pass the solution 
through a filter into a small tared beaker. Evaporate the solvent and 
dry the fat to a constant weight at a temperature of boiling water.

242 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Kohman determines the fat in butter by dissolving the fat with 
petroleum ether, leaving the salt and casein, which is weighed and the 
fat determined by difference, the water being first determined by 
direct heat over a flame. The method is given in full as follows : 

The moisture is determined as usual over a small flame in a tall, rather narrow, 
lipped aluminum beaker with a capacity of about 100 cc., using a 10-gram sample. 
After the beaker is weighed to determine the loss of moisture, it is filled with petro- 
leum ether and the contents stirred with a glass rod to secure a thorough mixture. 
It is then covered with a watch crystal and allowed to stand two or three minutes 
for the mixture of curd and salt to settle, when the solvent is gently decanted off 
without disturbing the sediment. The beaker is then filled with fresh solvent. The 
curd and salt mixture settles rapidly in the fresh solvent and the liquid can be de- 
canted off after a very short time. By gently heating the beaker now, either on a 
water bath, a hot plate, or directly over a small flame, but not so rapidly as to cause 
sputtering, the sediment can be completely freed of petroleum ether by evaporation 
in a very short time. The percentage of fat is then determined by difference upon 
reweighing the beaker with its contents. The salt is now in ideal condition to be 
determined by titration, using a solution of such strength that the number of cc. 
used represents the per cent, of salt. 

In distinguishing between butter and oleomargarine the nature of 
the fat is of prime importance. Blyth 2 gives the general composition 
of butter as follows: 

GLYCERIDES EQUAL TO FATTY ACIDS. 

Olein 42.21 = Oleic Acid 40.40 

Stearin and Palmitin 50.00 = Stearic and Palmitic 

Acids 47.50 

87.90 Total insoluble 
acids 

Butyrin 4.67 = Butyric Acids 3.49 

Caproin 3.02 =' Caproic Acids . 2.40 

Caprylin and Rutin . .10 = Caprylic and Rutic 

Acids .80 

100.00 94.59 Total acids. 

Reichert-Meissl Number. The most important chemical test for 
butter fat is the determination of the volatile fatty acids. As it is not 
convenient to determine the total amount of volatile acids, Reichert 
proposed a method for estimating a definite proportion thereof by 
using 2| grams of butter fat and saponifying with alcoholic potash, 
decomposing the soap with acid and collecting a definite quantity of 
the distillate and neutralizing the distillate with decinormal alkali. 
This method has been modified by Meissl (now called the Reichert- 
Meissl number) by using 5 grams of the fat and conducting the de- 

1 J. Ind. Eng. Chem., 1919, 11, 36.

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 243 

termination as follows: Weigh into a perfectly clean and dry 250-cc. 
Erlenmeyer flask 5 grams of the fat, prepared the same as in determin- 
ing the fat; add 10 cc. of alcohol and 2 cc. of sodium hydroxide solution 
and heat on a water bath until the fat is completely saponified. A re- 
turn flow condenser should be used while saponifying; or a small 
glass funnel placed in the neck of the flask will answer very well. 
After saponifying remove the condenser or funnel and evaporate the 
contents of the flask on a water bath to dry ness. To the soap formed 
add 135 cc. distilled water and then heat on a water bath until 
completely dissolved. Cool and add 5 cc. dilute sulphuric acid and 
cork the flask. Now reheat on the water bath until the fatty acids 
form an oily layer on the surface of the solution. Add pieces of 
pumice stone to the solution to lessen the danger of bumping when 
distilling, and connect the flask with a Liebig condenser. Distil until 
exactly 110 cc. come over, collecting the distillate in a sugar flask. 
Filter and titrate 100 cc. of the distillate with decinormal fixed alkali 
solution, using phenolphthalein as indicator. Multiply the number of 
cc. of N/10 alkali used by 1.1 to obtain the Reichert-Meissl number. 

If not convenient to weigh exactly 5 grams of the fat into the 250 cc. 
Erlenmeyer flask, transfer 5.75 cc. of the melted fat into the tared 
flask and when cool obtain the exact weight and continue the operation 
as above. The Reichert-Meissl number is then calculated by multi- 
plying the number of cubic centimeters of decinormal alkali used by 
1.1, dividing by the weight of the fat taken and multiplying by 5. 
For absolute work a blank determination should be made, and correc- 
tion made according to the result obtained. In the above, a sugar 
flask may be provided with a small funnel containing a tuft of ab- 
sorbent cotton to serve as a filter and the titration made directly on 
the 110 cc. as received. 

Reagents for Determining the Reichert-Meissl Number. 

Sodium Hydroxide Solution (1 : 1). The sodium hydroxide solu- 
tion should be as free as possible from carbonates. Protect the solution 
from contact with carbon dioxide. Allow to settle and use only the 
clear liquid. 

Alcohol. Use 95 per cent, alcohol by volume, distilled over sodium 
hydroxide. 

Decinormal Sodium Hydroxide Solution. 

Indicator. One gram phenolphthalein dissolved in 100 cc. of 95 per 
cent, alcohol. 

Pumice Stone. Heat small pieces to a white heat, plunge in water, 
and keep under water until used.

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



Dilute Sulphuric Acid. Dilute 200 cc. of concentrated sulphuric 
acid to 1 liter with distilled water. 

The above determination gives the Reichert-Meissl value, or number, 
which is expressed as the number of cc. of decinormal alkali required to 
neutralize the volatile, water-soluble fatty acids obtained from 5 grams of 
fat. 

Although the Reichert-Meissl number is generally expressed as 
stated, it is, in fact, a determination of the butyric acid or the volatile 
water-soluble acids of a fat, and if expressed as butyric acid, one cc. 
decinormal alkali will equal 0.0088 gram and the amount of butyric 
acid obtained from 5 grams of fat, multiplied by 20 will give the 
percentage. To calculate the Reichert-Meissl number from the per- 
centage of butyric acid, divide the percentage by 0.176 (0.0088 X 20). 

The standard for the Reichert-Meissl number of pure butter fat is 
generally considered to be 28 (Federal Standard 24), and this high 
value is a means of distinguishing butter fat from most other fats. 

The Refractive Index of butter fat varies from 1.4535 to 1.4552 at 
40 C , while the refractive index of fat from oleomargarine is 1.4650 to 
1.4700, and this determination is often made in the analysis of butter 
and oleomargarine.

Curd and Ash. The curd and ash is the residue remaining on the 
filter from the fat determination. Incinerate the filter paper con- 
taining the curd and ash, and cool and weigh the residue which repre- 
sents the ash. The percentage of water + fat + ash subtracted from 
100 will give the percentage of curd. The curd includes the casein 
and milk sugar. The ash should be mostly sodium chloride. 

Salt. In case the salt is to be determined, about 5 grams of the 
sample should be extracted with hot water by shaking in a separatory 
funnel and drawing off the aqueous solution. The sodium chloride 
is determined volumetrically by titration of the aqueous solution with 
decinormal s. ver nitrate.

245 



Preservatives. Boric acid is sometimes used as a preservative in 
butter and can be detected the same as in the analysis of milk. If 
formaldehyde is suspected, its detection would be the same as in 
milk. 

Coloring. The use of artificial coloring in butter is almost uni- 
versal and is permitted under the Federal and most State Laws. In 
some cases it is unlawful to use any coloring matter except of vegetable 
origin. The official ( Federal ) acid and alkali tests for artificial 
coloring are as follows: "Pour into each of two test tubes about 2 
grams of the filtered fat, dissolved in ether. Into one of the tubes 
pour 1 or 2 cc. of hydrochloric acid and into the other about the same 
volume of dilute potassium hydroxide solution. Shake the tubes 
well and allow to stand. In the presence of azo dye the test tube to 
which the acid has been added will show a pink to wine-red coloration, 
while the potash solution in the other tube will show no color. If, 
on the other hand, annatto or other vegetable color has been used,

when separation quickly takes place and the acid layer can be drawn 
off, its color noted, and portions treated with mineral acids and other 
reagents. Cornelison gives the reactions of the mineral acids with 
pure butter and also with butter colored as shown in table on page 245 . 

Brinsmaid's Test for Annatto. 3 Annatto may be identified in but- 
ter and oleomargarine by dissolving 15 cc. of the melted and filtered 
fat, prepared same as in the determination of butter fat, in 15 cc. 
chloroform, in a 60 cc. test tube. Add 15 cc. sodium hydroxide 
solution, cork the test tube and shake thoroughly for a few moments, 
then immerse the uncorked test tube in a bath of water at 50 C. to 
60 C. until the emulsion is pretty well broken up. Shake the tube. 
If there is a large amount of annatto present, it will not all be in soap 
froth, but there will be plenty for the test. Remove the soap froth 
to a small beaker and add 10 cc. of water and 2 cc. of the sodium 
hydroxide solution. Now add a sufficient amount of paper pulp to 
make a thin felt in a Gooch crucible. Let stand on a steam or water 
bath for about one-half hour, with frequent stirring, and the annatto 
will be absorbed by the paper pulp. Concentrate the liquid if only a 
small amount of annatto is present. Filter with light suction on a 
Gooch crucible containing a small disc of filter paper. If annatto is 
present the paper pulp will have an orange color. The addition of a 
few drops of stannous chloride solution to the paper pulp will produce 
a pink color if annatto is present. 

Reagents to be Used in Brinsmaid's Test for Annatto. 

Sodium Hydroxide Solution, made by dissolving 5 grams of sodium 
hydroxide in 95 cc. of water. 

Stannous Chloride Solution, prepared by making a saturated solution 
of tin in hydrochloric acid and diluting with an equal volume of water, 
and from time to time adding a slight excess of acid. Keep pieces of 
tin in the reagent bottle. 

See tests under coloring in milk. 

Butter Taints. The rancidity of butter is due to the presence of 
butyric acid and ethyl butyrate, which are produced by the decomposi- 
tion of the butter fat due to the presence of aerobic fungi such as Clado- 
sporium butyri and Oidium lactis, as well as Bacillus fluorescens lique- 
faciens and Bad. prodigiosum. 

Turnip Flavor of butter is due to Bacillus foetidus lactici.

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 247 

The Detection of Lime When Used to Neutralize Dairy Products. 
In the manufacture of high grade butter the cream should be sweet, 
and when churned, in addition to conforming to the standard for cream, 
the acidity should be not more than 0.234 to 0.27 per cent. The 
butter should contain not more than 13.5 per cent, of moisture and 
not over 2.25 to 3.25 per cent, of salt. 

Cream shipped from a distance to creameries is often, on arrival, 
sour, and in certain stages of decomposition. Before butter is 
made from such cream it is generally neutralized and pasteurized. 
Lime, in the form of slacked lime, mixed to a thin paste with water, 
is commonly used in the neutralization. The determination of the 
calcium oxide of the ash has been proposed as a reliable method for 
the differentiation of butter which has been manufactured from sweet 
cream and butter which has been made from "limed" sour cream. 
After liming and pasteurizing, an acid "starter" is added to ripen the 
cream. The starter may be simply a good quality of sour milk or 
cream, or a commercial culture of pure bacteria. 

The detection of lime used as a neutralizer in dairy products has 
been investigated by Wichmann 1 who claims that the calcium oxide 
in the ash will be increased when lime has been used and his conclusion 
is as follows : 

The percentage of calcium oxide in ash of milk, unneutralized cream, and butter 
made from unneutralized cream varies within fairly narrow limits, with a tentative 
maximum set at 25. When lime has been added to the cream in the process of manu- 
facture, this percentage is increased above 25 the increase varying with the amount 
of lime added and the degree of washing. 

The effect of calcium impurities in the salt has been studied and a method de- 
veloped to correct for the chief impurity, calcium sulphate. 

It has been shown that the percentage of calcium oxide in the salt-free ash of 
butter made from unneutralized cream will not exceed the tentative maximum limit 
of 25, unless high percentages of salt with much impurity are employed. 

Renovated Butter: Process Butter is the product made by melting 
butter and reworking, without the addition or use of chemicals or any 
substances except milk, cream, or salt, and contains not more than 
sixteen (16) per cent, of water and at least eighty-two and five-tenths 
(82.5) per cent, of milk fat. 2 

In addition to the tests given under oleomargarine, the test of Hess 
and Doolittle 3 should be applied as follows: A convenient sample of 
the butter, 25 to 100 grams, is placed in a beaker and melted at 45 C. 
to 50 C. Process butter will not yield a clear liquid fat at the end of

half an hour, or even 24 to 48 hours, while genuine dairy or creamery 
butter yields a clear supernatant liquid as soon as melted. 

In the case of butter or renovated butter the Reichert-Meissl number 
will be 24 or above. The Reichert-Meissl number in the case of 
oleomargarine will be under 24. 

To distinguish between genuine butter and renovated butter, the 
spoon test, Waterhouse test, and Hess and Doolittle test should be 
applied. In renovated butter the results are similar to those of 
oleomargarine, and the Reichert-Meissl number will determine the 
class to which the sample belongs.

OLEOMARGARINE. 

The Federal 1 Law defines oleomargarine as follows : 

That for the purpose of this act certain manufactured substances, certain ex- 
tracts, and certain mixtures and compounds, including such mixtures and com- 
pounds with butter, shall be known and designated as "oleomargarine," namely: 
All substances heretofore known as oleomargarine, oleo, oleomargarine-oil, butterine, 
lardine, suine, and neutral; all lard extracts and tallow extracts; and all mixtures and 

1 U. S. Internal Revenue Regulations, No. 9, Rev. July, 1907.

compounds of tallow, beef-fat, suet, lard, lard-oil, vegetable oil, annatto, and other 
coloring matter, intestinal fat, and offal fat made in imitation or semblance of butter, 
or when so made, calculated or intended to be sold as butter or for butter. 

Manufacturers are subject to a tax of six hundred dollars per annum 
and an additional tax is assessed on each pound sold. The act of 
May 9, 1902, in reference to same reads as follows: 

That upon oleomargarine which shall be manufactured and sold, or removed for 
consumption or use, there shall be assessed and collected a tax of ten cents per pound, 
to be paid by the manufacturer thereof; and any fractional part of a pound in a 
package shall be taxed as a pound; Provided, When oleomargarine is free from arti- 
ficial coloration that causes it to look like butter of any shade of yellow, said tax shall 
be one-fourth of one cent per pound. 

Most of the states have laws defining and covering the sale of oleo- 
margarine. In Ohio oleomargarine is defined as .any substance, not 
pure butter of not less than eighty per cent, of butter fats, which is 
made as a substitute for, an imitation of, or to be used as butter. 

The Ohio law also provides for placards to be displayed where 
oleomargarine is used or sold; it must be labeled oleomargarine, and 
the use of artificial coloring is prohibited. Violation of the act subjects 
the party to a fine of not less than fifty dollars and costs. 

The determinations made in the analysis of butter are applicable 
in testing oleomargarine, and the constants will be about the same 
except the Reichert-Meissl number which will run from up to 10 or 
15, but is usually under 2 or 3 (also low Polenske number), except in 
nut margarines prepared from cocoanut oil, when it will run from 15 to 
17, depending upon the amount of butter fat used in preparing the 
oleomargarine. The writer has found the percentage of water gen- 
erally somewhat lower in oleomargarine than in butter. 

Hydrogenated oils are used to a considerable extent in the manu- 
facture of oleomargarine, as well as neutral fat, beef fat stearin, cotton- 
seed oil and cottonseed oil stearin, and oleo oil. In addition to the 
above, large quantities of cocoanut oil are used in preparing the so- 
called "nut margarines." Other oils are being used, such as peanut 
oil, palm nut oil (which is considered a coloring), and palm nut kernel 
oil. 

The oils and fats are churned with milk which has been properly 
" ripened" the same as in the manufacture of butter. The liquid 
oleomargarine is run on cracked ice and thoroughly chilled. The 
product is then " ripened" by keeping the chilled fat in a room of 
constant temperature for from 15 to 24 hours. It is finally salted 
and worked the same as in the manufacture of butter. 

Coloring. Palm oil has been used in the manufacture of oleomar- 
garine, but under the Federal rulings it is considered a coloring matter 



254

and therefore cannot be used unless the tax for colored oleomargarine 
is paid. Methods of detecting palm oil have been described by 
Crampton and Simons 1 and others. See palm oil for tests. Tests 
employed in detecting artificial coloring in butter should be applied to 
oleomargarine. 

Analysis. 

The detecting of cocoanut oil in butter and oleomargarine is ac- 
complished by determining the Polenske number. 

The Polenske number is the number of cc. of decinormal alkali re- 
quired to neutralize the volatile, water-insoluble, fatty acids from 5 grams 
of fat. 

The Reichert-Meissl and Polenske numbers may be determined on 
the same portion of the sample. 

In addition to the.reagents used in the determination of the Reichert- 
Meissl number, the following is necessary : 

Glycerol-soda Solution. Add 20 cc. of the sodium hydroxide solu- 
tion (1 : 1) to 180 cc. of pure, concentrated glycerol. 
The determination is made as follows : 

Add 20 cc. of the glycerol-soda solution to 5 grams of the fat in a 
300-cc. round-bottom flask and heat over a free flame, or on an asbestos 

plate, until complete saponification 
takes place, as shown by the mix- 
ture becoming perfectly clear, which 
should require about five minutes. If 
foaming occurs, shake the flask 
gently. Add 135 cc. of distilled 
water, drop by drop at first, to pre- 
vent foaming, and 5 cc. of the dilute 
sulphuric acid (200 cc. H 2 S0 4 to 
1000 cc. distilled water). Distil 
without previous melting of the fatty 
acids, using apparatus illustrated in 
Fig. 16. Regulate the flame so as to 
collect 110 cc. in 20 minutes. Re- 
move the receiving flask and substi- 
tute a 25-cc. cylinder to collect any 
drops that may fall after the flame 
has been removed. Immerse the 
flask containing the distillate in 
water at 15 C. for 15 minutes;

trate 100 cc. with decinormal fixed

DAIRY PRODUCTS. 255 

alkali. Multiply the number of cc. of N/10 alkali used by 1.1 to ob- 
tain the Reichert-Meissl number. Remove the remainder of the 
water-soluble acids from the water-insoluble acids upon the filter 
paper by washing with three successive portions of 15 cc. of water, 
previously passed through the condenser, the 25-cc. cylinder and the 
110-cc. receiving flask. Then dissolve the water-insoluble acids by 
passing three successive 15-cc. portions of neutral 90-per cent, alcohol 
by volume through the filter each portion previously passed through 
the condenser, the 25-cc. cylinder and the 110-cc. receiving flask. The 
combined alcoholic washings are titrated with decinormal sodium 
hydroxide, using phenolphthalein as indicator. The Polenske number 
is reported as the number of cc. of decinormal fixed alkali required to 
neutralize the water-insoluble, volatile acids from 110 cc. of distillate 
from the 5 grams of fat. 

In case of nut margarine prepared from cocoanut oil, the Polenske 
value will generally run 10 to 15, according to the proportion of 
cocoanut oil used. 

Kirschner Value. To 100 cc. of the 110 cc. of the titrated distillate 
in the determination of the Reichert-Meissl number, add 0.5 gram 
of finely powdered silver sulphate, and allow to stand one hour, with 
occasional shaking. Filter the liquid and measure off 100 cc. of the 
filtrate, add 35 cc. water and 10 cc. sulphuric acid (as used in deter- 
mining the Reichert-Meissl Value); then distill until 110 cc. are 
collected. Filter and titrate 100 cc. of the filtrate with decinormal 
alkali and calculate the result for 5 grams of fat (if that amount was 
not used in the determination of the Reichert-Meissl Value). The 
number obtained is called the "New Value" or "Second Titration 
Value." The amounts of butter fat and cocoanut oil in margarine 
can be calculated from the two formulas: percentage of butter fat 
= 4.319, N.V. 0.456, R 2.15, and percentage of cocoanut oil 
= 7.42R - 8.116N.V. - 3.57, in which N.V. is the "New Value" 
and R. the Reichert-Meissl value of the sample. 

Spoon Test. 1 The most common test for oleomargarine is called 
the "spoon" test, or "foam" test. Heat in a large spoon, 3 or 4 grams 
of the sample, over a flame. Genuine butter will boil quietly and 
considerable foam will be produced. Renovated butter or oleo- 
margarine will bump and sputter like hot grease containing water, and 
very little foam will form. 

Waterhouse Test. C. L. Parsons 2 states that this should be carried 
out as follows: Half fill a 100-cc. beaker with sweet milk, heat nearly 
to boiling and add from 5 to 10 grams of butter or oleomargarine. Stir

with a small rod preferably of wood and about the size of a match 
until the fat is melted. The beaker is then placed in cold water and 
the milk stirred until the temperature falls sufficiently for the fat to 
congeal. At this point the fat, if oleomargarine, can easily be collected 
into one lump by means of the rod, while, if butter, it will granulate 
and cannot be collected. The distinction is very marked. The 
stirring is not, of necessity, continuous during the cooling, but it 
should be stirred as the fat is solidifying and for a short time before. 

Leach 1 states that by this test, in most cases, renovated butter can 
be distinguished from genuine as well as from oleomargarine. Gen- 
uine butter fat, even after cooling to the solidifying point, shows the 
greatest tendency to emulsionize with milk when stirred, does not 
adhere to the rod, and is slow to come to the surface when stirring is 
stopped. Renovated butter, on the other hand, when stirred in the 
cold milk, almost instantly gathers in a film on the surface of the milk, 
without emulsionizing, when stirring is stopped. It does not clot 
together like oleomargarine, but it tends to adhere to the wooden rod.

Preservatives in Oleomargarine. Sodium benzoate is used quite 
extensively as a preservative in oleomargarine. According to the 
Federal ruling it is permissible to use not to exceed 1/10 of one per cent, 
sodium benzoate provided its presence is proclaimed on the label. 

The A.O.A.C. method of estimating benzoic acid or benzoates is 
not applicable in the case of oleomargarine owing to the presence of 
volatile acids. Edward D. Davy has investigated the determination 
of benzoic acid in oleomargarine and has devised a method which is 
claimed to check within .01 per cent., as follows: 

Davy's Method for the Determination of Sodium Benzoate in Oleo- 
margarine. 1 Take 100 grams of sample, treat with 50 cc. of saturated 
salt solution containing approximately 0.5 per cent. NaOH. Add 
phenolphthalein indicator and heat to boiling, adding solution NaOH 
if necessary to maintain alkalinity. Stir vigorously, then transfer to 
a separatory funnel while still hot and separate aqueous layer. Re- 
peat this operation five times. (Test has shown this to be sufficient.)

258 PHARMACEUTICAL. AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Filter the combined liquids with suction and to the filtrate add a 
small amount of NaOH and an excess of CaCU (an excess over that 
necessary to combine with the fatty acids). Ca(OH) 2 is also pre- 
cipitated, which forms a very efficient filter bed. Filter. Acidify 
the filtrate with HC1 and shake out with ether usually four or five 
times is sufficient using 15 cc. each time. The combined ether ex- 
tractions are washed with water and evaporated spontaneously. The 
benzoic acid is dissolved in neutral 50 per cent, alcohol and titrated 
with a N/20 alkali, phenolphthalein indicator. Some albuminous 
matter is dissolved by the ether but this in no way interferes with the 
titration. One cc. N/20 alkali equals .0072 gram sodium benzoate. 

Nut Margarine and Vitamines. Extensive investigation has 
proven that certain substances contain what has been named "vit- 
amines," or, by Ramsden, 1 "sitacoid," meaning a medicine-like sub- 
stance associated with food. Vitamines are present in butter fat, 
codliver oil, beef fat oil, egg yolk fat, most of the animal fats (lard is 
an exception), milk, cheese, oleomargarine prepared from animal fats, 
cabbage, green leaves, carrots, potatoes and the juices of lemons and 
oranges. Vitamines are absent in lard and all vegetable oils, and 
oleomargarine made from same. They are absent, or present to a 
very limited extent, in rice and other cereals that have their outer 
coats removed. 

Although vitamines do not contain phosphorus, Voegtlin and 
Myers 2 have shown that in certain substances a low phosphoric 
anhydride content indicates that the product is poor in vitamines. 
Wheat and corn products with a phosphoric anhydride content of 0.62 
per cent, or above appear to have considerable vitamine content, while 
wheat and corn products with a percentage of phosphoric anhydride 
of 0.26 and under are very deficient in vitamines. 

Animals fed exclusively on polished rice develop the disease known 
as beri-beri, but an extract of the rice polishings contains a substance 
of which very minute quantities prevent or cure the disease. This 
substance is widely distributed in food products and is essential for 
growth, reproduction and life of animals. A second vitamine in food 
products appears necessary to prevent sore eyes (Xerophthalmia) ; a 
third vitamine or sitacoid has been discovered which has anti-scorbutic 
properties. 

Ramsden 3 gives a table of comparative values by different ob- 
servers of foods as to their vitamine content, as follows :

Nut margarines manufactured from vegetable oils do not contain 
vitamines except to a very small extent, they being derived from the 
milk in which the fats are worked. On the other hand, Pickard 1 
makes the following statement : 

Recently much has been done and said with reference to fat-soluble accessory 
growth substances, sometimes called food hormones or vitamines. It has been 
shown that vegetable oils do not contain in an appreciable amount these materials 
necessary to the proper growth and development of animal life. The materials do 
occur, however, in animal fats, green vegetables, milk, butter, eggs and other bodies. 
Some have gone so far as to say that nut margarine should not be fed to children 
because they lack these materials. However, when one considers how very small 
a proportion of a child's diet consists of butter, and that a properly fed child will 
receive these substances in much larger amounts from foods which form a far greater 
proportion of his diet than butter, one wonders whether the substitution of a hormone- 
free butter would produce an appreciable effect upon the growth of the child.

CHEESE. 

The Federal standard for cheese is as follows i 1 

1. Cheese is the sound, solid and ripened product made from milk or cream by 
coagulating the casein thereof with rennet or lactic acid, with or without the addition 
of ripening ferments and seasoning, and contains, in the water-free substance, not 
less than fifty (50) per cent, of milk fat. By Act of Congress, approved June 6, 
1896, cheese may also contain added coloring matter. 

2. Skim Milk Cheese is the sound, solid, and ripened product, made from skim 
milk by coagulating the casein thereof with rennet or lactic acid, with or without the 
addition of ripening ferments and seasoning. 

3. Goat's Milk Cheese, Ewe's Milk Cheese, et Cetera are the sound, ripened products 
made from the milks of the animals specified by coagulating the casein thereof with 
rennet or lactic acid, with or without the addition of ripening ferments and seasoning. 

Although Cottage Cheese is not recognized in the Federal standards, 
it is an article of considerable food value, as will be recognized by its 
composition, which averages: 

Water 72.0 

Protein 20.9 

Fat 1.0 

Carbohydrates 4.3 

Ash 1.8 

Filled Cheese is made from skimmed milk, and lard or other edible 
fat, substituted for butter fat. Wiley 2 states: "The characteristic

are entirely wanting, and the cheese is devoid of aroma and flavor and 
is nothing more than a mixture of casein and lard." 

Under the Ohio Law, cheese containing less than 21 per cent, of 
butter fat must be labeled " skimmed cheese" and must contain not 
less than 10 per cent, of butter fat. Cheese containing 21 per cent, 
or more and less than 31 per cent, of pure butter fat must be labeled 
"Ohio Standard Cheese," and cheese containing other fats than butter 
fat must be labeled "Filled Cheese." All cheese except filled cheese 
must be made exclusively of milk or cream with salt, rennet, and with 
or without harmless coloring matter to be legally sold in Ohio. Ohio 
State Full Cream Cheese must contain not less than 30 per cent, of 
butter fat. Full Milk Cheese is synonymous with Full Cream Cheese, 
under the Ohio Act. 

In case filled cheese is suspected the Reichert-Meissl number of the 
fat would settle the matter. The cheese fat should give a Reichert- 
Meissl number the same as for butter (see page 244), and is determined 
the same as in butter fat (see page 242). At present it appears filled 
cheese is very se'dom, if at all, offered for sale. 

Federal rule for labeling of " skimmed " and " part-skimmed " 
cheeses. 1 

The Bureau requires all skimmed or part-skimmed cheeses to be plainly labeled, 
or branded, with the words " skimmed " or " part-skimmed " upon the wrapper or con- 
tainer of each individual cheese, as well as upon the case in which a number of small 
cheeses are packed. 

Skimmed, or part-skimmed, cheeses of a size commonly sold uncut to the con- 
sumer, and not enclosed in a wrapper or other individual container, must be branded 
or labeled, in accordance with the fact, on the rind of the cheese itself. 

Large cheeses, skimmed or part-skimmed, which are not enclosed in a wrapper 
or other covering than the wooden drum or box, and which are commonly sold to 
the consumer in segments or slices and not as an entire cheese, need not have the 
brand or label on the cheese itself, but only on the drum or box. If, however, any 
circular or printed matter be inclosed with such cheese, it must bear in conspicuous 
type the words "skimmed" or "part-skimmed," in accordance with the fact. 

The Canadian standard for cheese is the same as in the United 
States, except as to butter fat, which must be not less than forty-five 
per cent, of milk fat. McGill 2 gives the result of the analyses of 166 
samples as follows: 

Samples containing over 60 per cent, fat 2 

Samples containing from 55 per cent, to 60 per cent, fat 27 

Samples containing from 50 per cent, to 55 per cent, fat 91 

Samples containing from 45 per cent, to 50 per cent, fat 39

262 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Varieties of Cheese. There are many varieties of cheese and they 
are commonly named from their place of origin, as "Chedder," a 
cheese made in England; "Edam," a Dutch cheese; "Neufehatel," a 
French cheese; "Roquefort," a French cheese originally made from 
ewe's milk. Some varieties take their name from their shape, as a 
hard, yellow coniform is called a pineapple cheese Then we have 
cream cheese, whole milk cheese and skimmed milk cheese the name 
indicating the quality. 

The absurdity of branding a cheese "full cream cheese" when made 
from whole milk was fully shown by G. E. Patrick at the Convention of 
the Association of State and National Food and Dairy Departments at 
Mackinac Island, August 4, 1908, when he stated: 

"I wish to direct your attention to our eminently respectable, life-long acquaint- 
ance, ubiquitous, hoary with age the time-honored FULL CREAM CHEESE. 
To attack such long-standing respectability, such a trade-bulwarked custom, re- 
quires temerity perhaps evinces foolhardiness but I venture it nevertheless. 

"The high-sounding name, Full Cream Cheese, as applied to simply whole milk 
cheese, has, I opine, already had too long a day. The name, probably at first ap- 
plied without intent to deceive, must, in this day of close scrutiny and exact ap- 
pellation, be declared misleading, whether or not it be considered absolutely false. 
'But what harm in the name,' someone will ask, 'so long as everyone knows it means 
only whole milk cheese?' In the first place, everyone does not know it. Many 
purchasers are deceived by it daily, many others, who have never seen nor heard the 
name, will perchance see it for the first time in large letters on the box of some fancy 
cheese, selling at a high price. Under such circumstances, what else can they think 
than that here is a wonderfully rich cheese, made entirely of cream? And alongside 
this cheese they may see another, labeled 'So and So's Cream Cheese.' This they 
will naturally believe to be a fine, rich article, made with a certain amount of cream 
but in all probability not nearly as rich as the one labeled 'Full Cream Cheese.' The 
latter must surely be the top notch of richness among cheeses. How could there 
possibly be anything richer? Astonished, indeed, would they be, if told by some 
friend with dairy knowledge that the 'Cream Cheese' contained ten, twenty, or 
perhaps thirty per cent, more fat than the 'Full Cream.'" 1 

Rusty Specks in cheese are due to Bacillus rudensis, and reddish 
color is due to red molds. 

Bitter Taste occurring at times in cheese is caused by micrococcus 
casei amari and other bacteria as well as by certain molds. 

Analysis of Cheese. 

In the analysis of cheese, determinations are made for the water, 
the fat, the ash and for preservatives. 

Water. Dry, at a temperature of 100 C., about 3 grams in a plat- 
inum milk pan, until a constant weight is obtained. Cool, weigh, 
and calculate the loss in weight as water. 

ij. A. O. A. C., 1921, 588-590. 



DAIRY PRODUCTS. 



263 



Ash. The ash is obtained by igniting the residue from the estima- 
tion of the water, until it is nearly white. Cool and weigh. 

Fat. Lythgoe's Modified Babcock method, as given by Leach, 1 
is as follows: About 6 grams of the sample are weighed into a tared 
beaker, and an emulsion is formed by adding 10 cc. of hot water and 
a few drops of ammonia to the cheese and stirring until free from 
lumps. After cooling it is transferred to a Babcock cream bottle as 
follows: About one-half of 17.6 cc. of sulphuric acid is stirred with the 
emulsion in the beaker and poured into the Babcock bottle. The 
remainder of the acid is used to wash out the beaker and the washings 
transferred to the test bottle. The test is completed the same as in 
estimating fat in milk. The sulphuric acid used should be of the same 
strength as is used in determining fat in milk. The reading is multi- 
plied by 18 and the product divided by the weight of cheese taken. 
The result is the percentage of fat. It is preferable to weigh the cheese 
in the Babcock cream bottle and then emulsify which obviates the 
liability of error in transferring from the beaker to the cream bottle. 

Preservatives. Generally, preservatives are not used in cheese, but 
the author has detected boric acid in a brand of cheese extensively 
sold. The manufacturers of this particular brand, when notified, 
agreed to remove all cheese of their make from Ohio and replace it 
with pure goods. 

Boric Acid. The same method as is used for the detection of boric 
acid in milk is used in cheese.

264 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Tyrotoxicon in Cheese. Vaughn has found the poison "tyro- 
toxicon" in cheese as well as in milk and ice cream. Tyrotoxicon 1 is 
isolated by preparing an aqueous extract from the cheese, filtering 
and making alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution. The poison 
being soluble in ether, it is separated from the extract by shaking out 
with ether. The ethereal solution is allowed to evaporate spon- 
taneously. By dissolving the ethereal extract in water and re-extract- 
ing with ether, and again allowing to evaporate spontaneously, needle- 
shaped crystals of the poison are obtained, in case the cheese contains 
tyrotoxicon. 

Vaughn and Novy give the following tests for the identification of 
tyrotoxicon : 

With equal parts of sulphuric and carbolic acids, pure tyrotoxicon 
gives a green coloration, but with whey the color varies from yellow 
to orange-red. However, as this coloration may be due to a nitrite 
or butyric acid, other tests should be applied as follows: 

The ether extract should be acidified with nitric acid and treated 
with an equal volume of a saturated solution of potassium hydroxide, 
and the whole concentrated on a water bath. On being heated, the 
mixture becomes yellowish-brown, and emits a peculiar aromatic 
odor. On cooling, the tyrotoxicon compound forms in beautiful, six- 
sided plates along with the prisms of potassium nitrate. 

With platinum chloride in alcoholic solution, tyrotoxicon forms 
a compound which explodes with great violence at the temperature of 
the water bath. Vaughn and Novy state that this corresponds with 
the compound of platinum chloride and diazobenzole.

CHAPTER VII. 

FLESH FOODS. 

The United States Department of Agriculture has adopted standards 
for meats as follows: 1 

Meat, Flesh, is any clean, sound, dressed, and properly prepared edible part of 
animals in good health at the time of slaughter, and if it bears a name descriptive of 
its kind, composition, or origin, it corresponds thereto. The term "animals," as 
herein used, includes not only mammals, but fish, fowl, crustaceans, mollusks, and 
all other animals used as food. 

Fresh Meat is meat from animals recently slaughtered and properly cooled until 
delivered to the consumer. 

Cold Storage Meat is meat from animals recently slaughtered and preserved by 
refrigeration until delivered to the customer. 

Salted, Pickled and Smoked Meats are unmixed meats preserved by salt, sugar, 
vinegar, spices, or smoke, singly or in combination, whether in bulk or in suitable 
containers. 

Manufactured Meats are meats not included in above paragraphs, whether simple 
or mixed, whole or comminuted, in bulk or in suitable containers, with or without 
the addition of salt, sugar, vinegar, spices, smoke, oils, or rendered fat. If they bear 
names descriptive of kind, composition, or origin, they correspond thereto, and when 
bearing such descriptive names, if force or flavoring meats are used, the kind and 
quantity thereof are made known. 

Although it is essential for the food analyst to be familiar with the 
constituents of meats commonly sold, his work is more in the line of 
determining adulterations in what will be considered as manufactured 
or prepared meats, such as hamburg steak, bologna sausage, etc. 

The constituents of pure meat, as generally considered, are water, 
protein, fat and ash. In prepared meats, attention is given to the 
addition of substances to increase the weight, coloring matter, and 
preservatives other than those allowed under " Manufactured Meats." 

Hamburg Steak is chopped raw beef. As found in many meat 
markets, it is prepared from the clippings and blood-stained portions 
of beef. These are run through a meat chopper, and often sulphites 
are added to produce a uniform color of fresh meat, and at the same 
time to preserve the steak. 

There are a number of proprietary preparations sold at fancy prices 
under such names as Preservaline, Freezine, Salutine, etc., which 
contain sulphites and in some cases coloring matter. All substances 

1 U. S. Dept. Agr., Cir. Office of Sec., 136, 3-4. 

266 



FLESH FOODS. 267 

of this nature added to beef give it a uniform color and appearance of 
fresh meat, and also act as preservatives and conceal putrefaction. 

In the examination of twenty samples of hamburg steak, the writer 
found the average water content to be 65.65 per cent.; ash 1.06 per 
cent., and twelve were adulterated, as they contained sulphites. 

Fresh beef is generally darker on the outside. By the addition of 
a small amount of sulphites, Hamburg steak can be prepared so as 
to have a uniform, slightly brighter color than the original meat. The 
addition of sulphites in some form is the only adulteration usually 
found in Hamburg steak. 

Sausage, as generally understood, is finely chopped pork, properly 
seasoned, and often enclosed in casings. It appears in this country 
that when sausage is called for, without qualifications, pork sausage 
should be the lawful article to sell. 

As so many definitions have been given for sausage, especially in 
Germany and England, the term is applied to all kinds of chopped 
meats, and it is necessary to specify the kind of sausage desired, as: 
pork sausage, bologna sausage, etc. Mitchell 1 enumerates seventeen 
different kinds of German sausage, prepared from meats and different 
combinations of meats. They are: 

Red Sausage (Rothwurst, Buntwurst), prepared from boiled pork and blood. 

Magenwurst contains less blood and more fat than Rothwurst, and is packed in a 
cleaned pig's stomach. 

Zungenwurst, composed of blood, fat pork, tripe, pig's head and liver. 

Blutwurst consists of pork, bacon, heart, kidney and blood. 

Lungenblutwurst, same as Blutwurst, with the addition of minced lung. 

Leberwurst consists of pigs' and calves' livers, mixed with lard and pork. 

Gehirn is prepared from calves' brains and pork. 

Presskopfwurst is made from pickled and boiled pig's head. 

Mosaik Sausage is a mixture of pork and beef, spiced. 

Abfallblutwurst is prepared from sinews and butcher's refuse, with bacon and 
pig's or ox blood. 

Schwartenwurst and Sulzenwurst consists of lightly cooked, unsalted ham and a 
little blood. 

Bratwurst is a mixture of raw pork and ham, salt, pepper, and sometimes lemon- 
peel or cumin. 

Cervelatwurst is composed of pork and lard, and often with the addition of beef 
or horse-flesh and colored with fuchsin. 

Knackwurst, or Crackling Sausage, is a smoked sausage of the same composition 
as cervelatwurst, but differing by previously cooking the meat. 

Knoblauchwurst, or Garlic Sausage, has the same composition as knack wurst, 
with the addition of garlic. 

Frankfort, or Vienna Wurstchen, are composed of raw, lean meat, seasoned with 
salt and pepper. 

Erbswurst contains beef-fat, bacon, pea-meal, onions, salt, and seasoning. 

1 Flesh Foods, 125-126. 



268 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

English sausages are prepared from raw meat, flavored and spiced, 
and frequently have incorporated with the above, bread crumbs. 

Mitchell 1 states that the chief difference in the manufacture of 
French and English sausages is the enormous extent to which horse 
flesh is used, and that 20,000 horses were slaughtered in Paris in 1892 
for human food, the flesh of which was mostly manufactured into 
sausage. 

Hoey 2 reports that horses are killed for human food and sold in 
Chicago to cheap restaurants and cheap free-lunch saloons, and the 
cured horse casings sold to sausage manufacturers. 

As horse meat is sold in many of the large cities in the United States, 
methods of identification will be given due consideration in this 
chapter. 

The addition of starch, or what is sold as potato flour, bread crumbs, 
and crackers are common adulterants of sausage. It is claimed that 
the addition of potato flour increases the absorbing power of meat, 
but by the analysis of a number of samples of sausage this did not 
prove true. 

The analysis of 23 samples of commercial sausages gave: 

Water (average) 43.44; Ash 2.11. 

The analysis of 15 samples of commercial sausages containing 
starch gave: 

. Water (average) 44.19; Ash 1.98. 

It will be noticed that the sausages containing starch contained an 
average of only 0.75 per cent, more water than the starch-free article. 

No doubt the starch-free samples examined were prepared by the 
liberal use of water, as is customary with sausage manufacturers. 
The use of starch would simply increase the weight and decrease the 
cost, and at the same time assist in holding the water and preventing 
shrinkage of the casings. 

Water, starch, cereals, and preservatives are the most frequently 
found adulterants of sausage in this country. 

In Canada the standards for sausage are somewhat different than 
in the United States, according to the Departmental Standards 
published in Bulletin No. 392 of the Inland Revenue Department 
which are as follows: 

Sausage, sausage meat, is a comminuted meat from swine or neat cattle, or a 
mixture of such meats, either fresh, salted, pickled or smoked, with added salt and 
spices and with or without the addition of edible animal fats, cereals, blood and 

1 Flesh Foods, 128.

FLESH FOODS. 269 

sugar, or subsequent smoking. It contains no larger amount of water than the meats 
from which it is prepared contain when in their fresh condition, and not more than 
ten per cent, of its weight of cereals; and if it bears a name descriptive of kind, com- 
position or origin, it corresponds to such descriptive name. All animal tissues used 
as containers, such as casings, stomachs, etc., are clean and sound and impart to the 
contents no other substance than salt. 

Blood sausage is sausage to which has been added clean, fresh blood from neat 
cattle or swine in good health at the time of slaughter. 

Methods of Analysis. 

In the analysis of " Flesh Foods " in the natural or prepared forms 
the sample should be passed through a meat chopper in order to pro- 
duce a homogeneous mass. 

If the analysis is made in order to determine the purity of the sample, 
only, the following estimations will generally be sufficient: Water, 
Ash, Starch, Preservatives, Fat, Nitrogen and Coloring. 

Water. Dry about 3 grams in a flat-bottomed silica dish at a 
temperature of 100 C. until a constant weight is obtained. The loss 
of weight is calculated as water. 

Ash. Incinerate the solids obtained in the determination of water 
until practically a white ash is obtained. Cool and weigh. 

Starch. Whether used as potato flour, bread crumbs, cereals, 
crackers, etc. is detected by boiling about 5 grams of the sample with 
15 cc. of water: Cool and add a drop or two of iodine reagent. The 
well-known blue color will be produced at once if starch is present. 
A very light blue coloration may be noticeable, due to starch present 
in pepper or other spices used in preparing the meat. A microscopi- 
cal examination will generally indicate the source of the starch. 

Association of Official Agricultural Chemists Method 1 for the De- 
termination of Starch in Meat Products. 

Treat in a 200 cc. beaker, 10 grams of the finely divided sample with 75 cc. of an 
8 per cent, solution of potassium hydroxide in 95 per cent, alcohol, by volume, and 
heat on a steam bath until all the meat is dissolved (30 to 40 minutes). Add an 
equal volume of 95 per cent, alcohol, cool and allow to stand for at least an hour. 
Filter by suction through a thin layer of asbestos in a Gooch crucible. Wash twice 
with 4 per cent, potassium hydroxide in 50 per cent, alcohol, by volume, and then 
twice with warm 50 per cent, alcohol. Discard the washings. Retain as much of 
the precipitate in the beaker as possible until the last washing. Place the crucible 
with the contents in the original beaker, add 40 cc. of water and 25 cc. of concentrated 
sulphuric acid. Stir during the addition of the acid and make sure that the acid 
comes in contact with all the precipitate. Allow to stand about 5 minutes; add 40 
cc. of water and heat just to boiling, stirring constantly. Transfer the solution to a 
250 cc. graduated flask, add 2 cc. of 20 per cent, phosphotungstic acid solution, allow 

i Methods of Analysis, 1916, 276. 



270 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

to cool at room temperature and make up to mark with water. Filter through a 
starch-free filter paper; pipette 100 cc. of the filtrate into a 200 cc. graduated flask, 
neutralize with sodium hydroxide solution, make up to volume and determine the 
dextrose present in a 50 cc. portion of the filtrate by the method given for the deter- 
mination of lactose in milk. The weight of the dextrose multiplied by 0.9 gives the 
weight of the starch. Multiply the weight of the starch found by 100 and the product 
will equal the percentage. 

Preservatives. Of all preservatives in meat, no doubt sulphites 
in some form are used most frequently. Sodium sulphite and bisul- 
phite, and calcium sulphite are the salts .mostly found, although meat 
is often contaminated by sulphurous acid formed by burning sulphur 
in meat coolers or refrigerators. 

Boric acid and formaldehyde are occasionally used, and aluminum 
acetate 1 has been found in imported canned sausage. 

Saltpeter is not included in the list of prohibited preservatives, 
although apparently it should be. It is a common practice to make 
a brine of salt and saltpeter. In sugar-cured and smoked hams salt- 
peter is generally used in large quantities. It gives the meat a strong, 
disagreeable flavor and at the same time colors the meat a dark red. 

Nitrates may be detected by the diphenylamine test as applied 
by Bigelow and Cook. 2 Transfer 1.5 grams of the solid or of the 
semi-solid, or 1 cc. of the liquid extract to a 250 cc. beaker. Add 
distilled water and boil with animal charcoal for two or three minutes. 
Filter the solution while hot and test one drop of the filtrate with 
three drops of diphenylamine reagent. A blue color indicates nitrates, 
and the depth of color indicates in a general way the amount of nitrates 
present. 

Diphenylamine reagent is prepared by dissolving 1 part of diphenyl- 
amine in 100 parts of concentrated sulphuric acid. 

Benzoic acid is often used in preserving dried fish, such as cod. The 
fish, or other meat, being finely divided, is macerated in water made 
alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution. The solution being sep- 
arated from the solids, the meat should be shaken with different por- 
tions of the alkaline solution until all of the benzoate is removed. The 
several portions of alkaline solutions containing the benzoate, being 
mixed, are shaken out with ether or petroleum ether to free it from fat. 
After removal of the fat, make the solution acid with phosphoric 
acid and extract the benzoic acid with several portions of ether. This 
method can be made quantitative the solution of benzoates, after 
being made acid, may be placed in a Hortvet apparatus and the

benzole acid distilled and then removed with ether, the ether evap- 
orated and the benzole acid weighed. 

Sulphites are detected by placing about 25 grams of the meat in a 
250 cc. Erlenmeyer flask, together with sufficient water to just cover 
the meat, then adding a few pieces of sulphur-free zinc and from 5 to 
10 cc. of hydrochloric acid. If the meat contains sulphites, hydrogen 
sulphide will be generated, which will color lead acetate paper black. 

Mitchell l publishes as a frontispiece in " Flesh Foods," Eber's 
color scale. The lowest number of the scale indicates the coloration 
corresponding to 0.002 milligram of hydrogen sulphide, and the 
highest number indicates 0.01 milligram. Unadulterated meats 
may show any of the colors as indicated on Eber's scale, as pure meat 
contains a trace of sulphur. In case of putrefaction, owing to the 
decomposition of the protein, a color might be obtained to correspond 
to the highest number on the scale, even from meat free from added 
sulphites. 

The United States Department of Agriculture Official Method of 
determining the total sulphurous acid by distillation is as follows : 2 

Distil 100 grams (adding water, if necessary) in a current of carbon dioxide, after 
the addition of 5 cc. of a 20 per cent, solution of glacial phosphoric acid, until 50 cc. 
have passed over. Collect the distillate in a tenth-normal iodine solution in a flask 
closed with a stopper perforated with two holes, through one of which the end of the 
condenser passes, and through the other a U-tube containing a portion of the stand- 
ardized iodine solution. Twenty-five cc. of tenth-normal iodine solution may be 
employed, diluted with water to give the desired volume. The method and apparatus 
may be simplified without material loss of accuracy by omitting the current of carbon 
dioxide, adding 10 cc. of phosphoric acid instead of 5 cc. and dropping into the distil- 
ling flask a piece of sodium bicarbonate (weighing not more than a gram), immedi- 
ately before attaching to the condenser. The carbon dioxide liberated is not sufficient 
to expel the air entirely from the apparatus, but will prevent oxidation to a large 
extent. The U-tube trap may also be omitted if the end of the condenser tube is 
made to extend below the surface of the iodine solution, and the distillation conducted 
with a steady flame. When the distillation is finished, wash the contents of the 
U-tube into the flask and determine the excess of iodine with standard thiosulphate 
solution. On account of its lack of permanence, the iodine solution employed should 
be titrated from time to time with tenth-normal thiosulphate solution (containing 
24.8 grams Na 2 S 2 O3.5H 2 O per liter). One cc. of tenth-normal iodine solution is 
equivalent to 0.0032 gram of sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ). 

The above is the general method of determining sulphites in foods, 
but in case of meats or meat products, 20 cc. of a 20-per cent, solution 
of phosphoric acid should be used in place of 5 cc.

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



The A. 0. A. C. Method 1 is the same as above except that the distil- 
late is conducted into 100 cc. of nearly saturated bromine water. 
When the distillation is finished the solution is boiled to expel the 
excess of bromine and then diluted with distilled water to 250 cc. 
Five cc. hydrochloric acid (1 to 3) are added, the solution heated to 
boiling and the sulphuric acid precipitated with 10 per cent, barium 
chloride solution. It is then boiled a few minutes longer, allowed to 
stand in a warm place ten to twelve hours, and filtered onto a weighed 
Gooch, washed with water, and ignited at a dull red heat. Weigh as 
barium sulphate. 




FIG. 17. Hortvet's Apparatus. 

When 100 grams of sample are used the amount of barium sulphate 
found, multiplied by 0.274, will equal the percentage of sulphites cal- 
culated as S02 and the amount of sodium sulphite (Na 2 S0 3 + 7H 2 0) 
may be obtained by multiplying the barium sulphate by 1.08. 

Gudeman 2 states that the official method is inaccurate, and will 
show weighable amounts of sulphur dioxide from food products free 
from sulphur, and that animal and vegetable food products normally 
contain sulphur compounds which on distillation with acids give 
volatile sulphur compounds which are calculated as sulphur dioxide. 
To obviate this error, he proposes a method of distillation in steam.

A very convenient method for steam distillation is to take 10 to 
20 grams of the sample and use Hortvet's 1 apparatus for the deter- 
mination of volatile acids in wines. Very little trouble from bumping 
and foaming is experienced when this method is employed. A small 
piece of paraffine added to the mixture will prevent foaming with 
either the steam or direct distillation method. 

Boric Acid and Borates are detected by adding dilute hydrochloric 
acid to the ash and moistening a piece of tumeric paper with the 
solution. The tumeric paper on drying will acquire a peculiar red 
color which is changed by ammonium hydroxide to a dark green. 

Hortvet's apparatus is also useful in the determination of boric 
acid or borates in meat products, according to Cladding's 2 method. 
About 10 grams (accurately weighed) of the sample are placed into 
the inner flask with 10 cc. of 95 per cent, methyl alcohol. 150 cc. 
of 95 per cent, methyl alcohol are placed into the outer flask. After 
connection is made with the condenser allow to flow from the funnel 
into the inner flask 10 cc. of 85 per cent, phosphoric acid. Heat on 
a water bath and a current of methyl alcohol vapor passes from the 
outer flask through the liquid in the inner flask and carries over the 
boric acid. The distillate should measure about 100 cc., or should 
continue until no more acid is obtained. A mixture of 40 cc. glycerin 
and 100 cc. water is carefully neutralized, using phenolphthalein as 
indicator, and then added to the distillate, which is then titrated with 
tenth-normal sodium hydroxide. 

One cc. tenth-normal sodium hydroxide equals : 

Crystallized boric acid H 3 B0 3 0.0062 gm. 

Boric anhydride B 2 O 8 0.0035 gm. 

Crystallized borax Na2B 4 O 7 10H 2 O 0.00955 gm. 

Formaldehyde. Macerate two or three hundred grams of the sample 
with 100 cc. of water contained in a 500 cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and 
acidify with phosphoric acid. Connect the flask with a condenser and 
distil from 40 to 50 cc. Test for formaldehyde by Hehner's method 
by mixing in a test tube about 5 cc. of the distillate with an equal 
volume of milk; then carefully add, without mixing, strong commercial 
sulphuric acid. If a violet or blue color appears at the junction of 
the two liquids, formaldehyde is present. 

Horse Flesh. As horse meat is being sold in many cities of the 
United States it is quite essential for the analyst to be able to detect 
same. A number of methods have been proposed. In case of pure 
horse meat it may generally be detected by rendering the fat and

taking the iodine value. Although the iodine value of horse fat varies, 
more or less, according to whether it is obtained from the neck, kidneys, 
back or leaf fat, it will generally run between 74.84 and 85.4. Lard 
runs from 46 to 70 (U. S. P.). But as a general rule lard will be nearer 
65 than the higher limit of 70, as given by the Pharmacopoeia. 

The iodine value of tallow or beef fat is much lower than for lard 
(35 to 44), and would be easily distinguished from horse fat. 

Bremer 1 has determined the iodine number of the intramuscular 
fat obtained from horse meat and in mixtures of horse meat and pork, 
his results are as follows:

The above data is sufficient to differentiate between horse flesh 
and beef when unmixed, but in case of sausage or bologna, prepared 
from the mixed meats, it is necessary to apply other tests. 

Horse flesh may be detected by treating the sample with for- 
maldehyde. If horse meat is present a characteristic odor resembling 
roast goose flesh is developed in twenty-four hours. 

Glycogen reaction is given by Brautigam and Edelmann 2 as follows : 

Fifty grams of the finely divided flesh are boiled for an hour with four times the 
volume of water, and dilute nitric acid added to the resulting broth, when cold, with 
the object of precipitating proteid substances and decolorizing the liquid. The 
filtrate is tested with a freshly prepared, saturated, aqueous solution of iodine, which 
is added so as to form a layer on the surface of the liquid. In the presence of glycogen 
a wine-red ring is formed at the point of contact. When the color does not appear, 
or is uncertain, the flesh is heated on the water bath with a solution of potassium 
hydroxide (3 per cent, of KOH calculated on the flesh) until the muscular fiber is 
decomposed. The broth is concentrated to half its volume, the proteid precipitated 
with nitric acid, and the iodine solution added as before. 

It should be remembered that glycogen is transitory, being easily 
broken up into other substances, and may not appear in the meat 



1 J. Soc. Chem. Ind., 1897, 16, 641.

275 



unless examined immediately after slaughtering the animal. As 
the fat does not change like the glycogen the constants of horse fat 
are the most reliable tests. 

Estimation of Glycogen in Meat Extracts. 1 Twenty-five grams 
of the sample are dissolved in 100 cc. of water, mixed with 100 to 
150 cc. of 4 per cent, solution of caustic potash in 90 per cent, alcohol 
and allowed to rest one or two hours. The precipitate is filtered off, 
washed with 90 per cent, alcohol, dissolved off the paper with 50 cc. 
of water, and the solution faintly acidified with weak hydrochloric 
acid. It is next precipitated with about 10 cc. of a solution of potas- 
sium mercuric iodide, filtered after half an hour, and the insoluble 
matter washed with hot water. From the filtrate the glycogen is 
thrown down on the addition of an equal volume of 95 per cent, 
alcohol, collected on a tared filter, washed with alcohol and ether, 
dried and weighed. The double mercuric iodide is prepared by dis- 
solving 20 grams of mercuric chloride in 300 cc. of water, mixing with 
20 grams of potassium iodide dissolved in 100 cc. of water, and adding 
more mercuric chloride as long as the precipitate continues to disappear. 

The presence of glycogen, unless found in considerable quantities, 
would not be evidence of adulteration with horse flesh, as beef muscle 
has been found to contain from 0.1 to 0.7 per cent, and beef liver from 
0.2 to 3.8 per cent, of glycogen. 2

276 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Bouillon Cubes, Meat Extracts, Fluid Meat Extracts, Meat Juices 

and similar preparations are examined the same as other meat products. 

Yeast Extracts are sold as substitutes for beef extracts. Cook 
states that yeast extracts are not manufactured in this country to 
any great extent, but are made quite extensively in Germany. His 
analyses show that yeast extracts do not contain creatin and creatinin. 1 

Creatin and Creatinin are determined by FohVs colorimetric method, 
the creatin being inverted into creatinin. 

The color produced by adding a solution of picric acid to an alkaline 
solution of meat product containing creatinin is matched against 
potassium dichromate solution, which has been checked against a 
standard creatin solution. The potassium dichromate solution should 
correspond to 10 milligrams of creatinin when the scale of Duboscq 
colorimeter is set at 8 mm. The method is applied according to 
directions given in Methods of Analysis, A. 0. A. C., as follows: 

Creatin in Meat. In case of meat an extract is prepared by ex- 
hausting 20 grams of the sample by weighing into a 150 cc. beaker and 
adding 5 to 10 cc. of cold ammonia-free water and stirring until a 
homogeneous paste is formed. Add 50 cc. of cold water and stir the 
mixture every three minutes for fifteen minutes. After standing two 
or three minutes, decant the liquid through a quantitative filter into 
a 500 cc. graduated flask. Drain the beaker and press the liquid from 
the meat residue with a glass rod. Place the residue into the beaker 
and stir with 50 cc. of cold water; after standing two or three minutes, 
decant as before. This treatment of the meat is repeated with the 
following amounts of cold water: 50, 50, 25, 25, 25, and 25 cc. Finally 
the entire insoluble portion is washed with three 10-cc. portions of 
water. The total filtrate and washings is made up to the 500-cc. 
mark. 

In the determination of creatin 150 cc. of the above solution are 
transferred to a 250 cc. beaker and treated as follows: Evaporate to 
40 cc. on a steam bath, with occasional shakings. Neutralize, using 
phenolphthalein as indicator; then add 1 cc. of normal acetic acid and 
boil gently for 5 minutes. The coagulum should settle at once leaving 
a clear liquid. Filter on quantitative paper; wash the paper thor- 
oughly four times with water, and finally wash the coagulum three 
times and evaporate the combined washings to 5 or 10 cc. Add to 
the sample, in a 50-cc. measuring flask, 10 cc. 2N hydrochloric acid 
and mix. Hydrolize in an autoclave at 117-120 C. for 20 minutes; 
allow the flask to cool somewhat; remove and chill under running 
water. Partially neutralize the excess of acid by adding 7.5 cc. of 

1 U. S. Dept. Agr., Bur. Chem., Cir., 62, 4. 



FLESH FOODS. 277 

10 per cent, sodium hydroxide solution, free from carbonates; dilute 
to 50 cc.; mix, and transfer 25 cc. to a 500 cc. graduated flask. Add 
10 cc. of 10 per cent, solution of sodium hydroxide and 30 cc. of a 
saturated picric acid solution (1:2); mix and rotate for 30 seconds and 
let stand exactly 4| minutes. Dilute to the 500 mark at once with 
water, shake thoroughly and read in a Duboscq colorimeter com- 
paring the color with N/2 potassium dichromate solution, set at 8 mm. 

If the reading is too high or too low (above 9.5 or below 7 mm.), 
calculate the quantity necessary to obtain a reading of about 8 mm. 
The strength of the dichromate solution used must be checked against 
a standard creatin solution. To obtain the values, divide 81 by the 
reading and multiply by the volume factor to obtain mg. of creatinin. 
This value multiplied by 1.16 gives creatin, which divided by the 
weight of the sample and multiplied by 100 gives the per cent, of 
creatin. 

Example. Twenty grams of meat are extracted with water and 
the extract diluted to 500 cc.; 150 cc. of this latter solution (equivalent 
to 6 grams of meat) are treated with acetic acid and evaporate as 
directed above. After hydrolizing and making up to 50 cc., 25 cc. of 
the solution are treated with sodium hydroxide solution and picric 
acid solution as directed above and diluted to 500 cc., this latter 
solution reading 9 mm. 

81 50 

X = 18 mg. creatinin; 

y Zo 

0.018 X 1.16 X 100 

- = 0.35% creatin. 

Creatin in Beef Extract. In case of meat extracts, 7 grams of the 
sample are dissolved in sufficient quantity of ammonia-free water 
to make 250 cc. Transfer 20 cc. of this solution to a 50 cc. flask and 
hydrolize; and continue the determination the same as given for 
meat. Subtract from the combined creatinin value the equivalent 
of the preformed creatinin and multiply the difference by 1.16 to 
convert into creatin. Express the result as per cent, of creatin. 

Creatinin in Beef Extract is determined by measuring 5 cc. of the 
solution as used in the estimation of creatin, in a 500 cc. measuring 
flask. Add 10 cc. of 10 per cent, sodium hydroxide solution and 
30 cc. of the saturated picric acid solution (1:2), mix and rotate 30 
seconds. Allow to stand exactly 4J minutes, then dilute to 500 cc. 
at once with water. Shake thoroughly and read the depth of color 
after standing. If the reading is less than 7 mm. or over 9.5 mm., 
repeat, calculating the quantity of solution necessary to obtain a 



278 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

reading of about 8 mm. Express the result as per cent, of creatinin, 
making the calculations as indicated under creatin in meat. 

Fat is determined by drying the sample and extracting with a 
suitable solvent. 

Nitrogen is determined by the regular method given on page 69. 

Coloring is used to a certain extent to color sausages and sausage 
casings. Sulphites are used as a coloring in fresh meats as well as 
for a preservative. Methods have already been given for the de- 
tecting of coloring matter in different preparations and the same pro- 
cedure should be applied to meats and meat preparations.

PANCREATIN AND PEPSIN 

Are two Pharmacopoeia! substances which naturally should be 
considered in this chapter. 

Pancreatin, according to the United States Pharmacopoeia, con- 
tains enzymes consisting principally of amylopsin, trypsin and steap- 
sin, found in the pancreas of warm-blooded animals and obtained 
from the pancreas of the hog (Sus scrofa var. domesticus Gray) (Fam. 
Suidae), or of the ox (Bos taurus Linne) (Fam. Bovidae). It con- 
verts not less than 25 times its own weight of starch into soluble 
carbohydrates when assayed as follows: 

Assay: Shake 10 Gm. or more of powdered potato starch with about 
10 times its weight of cold distilled water, and, after draining the 
mixture on a filter, wash it with the same quantity of distilled water. 
Place the washed starch at once in an air bath and maintain a tem- 
perature of about 50 C. until the starch is sensibly dry. Reduce 
it to a fine powder and place it in a well-stoppered bottle. Deter- 
mine the percentage of water still remaining in the starch by drying 
about 0.5 Gm. of it in an air bath, gradually raising the temperature 
to 120 C. and maintaining it at that temperature for four hours. 
Of the washed and partially dried starch, mix a quantity equivalent 
to 7.5 Gm. of dry starch in a 400 cc. beaker with 10 cc. of cold, dis- 
tilled water, add 190 cc. of boiling distilled water and boil the mixture 
gently (for approximately five minutes) with constant stirring until 
a translucent uniform paste is obtained. Replace the water lost by 
evaporation and cool the paste to 40 C. in a water bath previously 
adjusted to this temperature and add a solution of 0.3 Gm. of Pan- 
creatin in 10 cc. of distilled water, just previously made at 40 C. 



282 PHARMACEUTICAL . AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Mix and maintain the same temperature for exactly five minutes, 
when a thin, nearly clear liquid is produced. At once add 0.1 cc. of 
this liquid to a previously made mixture of 0.2 cc. of tenth-normal 
iodine V.S. and 60 cc. of distilled water; no blue, red, or violet color 
is produced. 

Pepsin is described as a mixture containing a proteolytic ferment 
or enzyme, obtained from the glandular layer of the fresh stomach 
of the hog (Sus scrofa var. domesticus Gray) (Fam. Suidae). It 
digests not less than 3000 times its own weight of freshly coagulated 
and disintegrated egg albumen when assayed according to the United 
States Pharmacopoeia as follows : 

Assay: Mix 25 cc. of normal hydrochloric acid V.S. with 275 cc. of 
distilled water and dissolve 0.1 Gm. of Pepsin in 150 cc. of this liquid. 
Immerse a hen's egg, which is not less than five nor more than twelve 
days old and has been kept in a cool place, in boiling water during 
fifteen minutes. As soon as the egg has sufficiently cooled to handle 
it, remove the pellicle and all of the yolk; at once rub the albumen 
through a clean, dry, hair or brass, No. 40 sieve, reject the first portion 
that passes through the sieve, and place 10 Gm. of the succeeding 
portion in a wide-mouth bottle of 100 cc. capacity. Immediately 
add 2 cc. of the acid liquid and, with the aid of a rubber-tipped glass 
rod, moisten the albumen uniformly. Again add 2 cc. of the acid 
liquid, repeat the manipulation with the glass rod, and with gradually 
increasing portions of the acid liquid, until the total amount added 
measures 20 cc. Thoroughly separate the particles of albumen from 
each other, rinse the rod with 15 cc. more of the acid liquid, and, 
after warming the mixture to 52 C. add exactly 5 cc. of the solution 
of Pepsin. At once cork the bottle securely, invert it three times, 
and place it in a water bath that has previously been regulated to 
maintain a temperature of 52 C. Keep it at this temperature for 
two and one-half hours, agitating the contents every ten minutes by 
inverting the bottle once. Then remove it from the bath, pour the 
contents into a conical measure having a diameter not exceeding 1 cm. 
at the bottom, and transfer the undigested egg albumen which ad- 
heres to the sides of the bottle to the measure with the aid of small 
portions (about 15 cc. at a time) of distilled water, until the total 
amount used measures 50 cc. Stir the mixture well and let it stand 
half an hour; the deposit of undissolved albumen does not then measure 
more than 1 cc. 

The relative proteolytic power of Pepsin, stronger or weaker than 
that just described, may be determined by ascertaining through re- 
peated trials the quantity of the Pepsin solution, made as directed 
in the assay, required to digest, under the prescribed conditions, 



FLESH FOODS. 283 

10 Gm. of boiled and disintegrated egg albumen. Divide 15,000 by 
this quantity expressed in cc. to ascertain how many parts of egg 
albumen one part of Pepsin will digest.

OYSTERS. 

" Oysters belong to a class of animals known as mollusks. They 
grow in salt or brackish water and are found along almost the whole 
of the coast of the United States. They exist in the greatest abund- 
ance along the coast in the vicinity of Long Island Sound, Norfolk, 
Virginia, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast from San 
Francisco to the northern limits of Washington." l 

The large bulk of oysters shipped to all parts of the country are 
shucked, or free from shells, and they were formerly shipped in tubs, 
together with ice added directly to the oysters. Owing to regula- 
tions, both Federal and State, in reference to " watering," most 
oysters are now shipped in sealed tin containers and packed in ice, 
so that they are furnished to the dealer at a distance in the same con- 
dition as they were when shipped. 

In the analysis of oysters, the determination of added water is very 
important. The amount of water permissible in unadulterated oysters 
is a question not fully settled, although certain limits have been 
suggested. 

Bigelow 2 gives as the limit " not to exceed 15 per cent, of free water 
that may be separated out by means of a colander " and says it will 
seldom exceed 10 per cent. Crumbine 3 states that the standard 
established by Kansas is 10 per cent, total solids, in the fattened 
oysters. Wright 4 claims that the free liquor will run from 8 to 9 
per cent, up to 16-2/3 per cent. 

Analysis of Oysters. 

About one pint of oysters are generally used and the net weight, in 
grams, is first obtained.

286 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The exterior liquor is determined by transferring the sample to a 
20-mesh, five-inch sieve and draining for fifteen minutes. It is gen- 
erally necessary to carefully stir the oysters two or three times, while 
draining, to prevent clogging of the sieve. 

A 20-mesh, five-inch sieve, a colander, or a Buchner's porcelain 
funnel, as suggested by McPherson, 1 will be found convenient for 
draining the oysters. 

After draining the oysters, the exterior liquor obtained is then 
weighed and the percentage calculated. The solids in the exterior 
liquor are determined by carefully weighing about 5 grams of the 
liquor in a platinum pan; drying in a water bath until a constant 
weight is obtained; then cool and weigh. 

Ash. Incinerate the solids until a nearly white ash is procured. 

The water, solids and ash are determined in the drained oysters 
in a similar manner, the oysters being first run through a meat 
chopper to have the sample uniform. 

The calculations made from actual work are as follows : 

Net weight of sample 510 grams, 

Net weight of exterior liquor 65 grams, or 12.74%. 

Net weight of drained oysters 445 grams, or 87.26%. 

To determine the solids in the drained oysters, 4.3043 grams were 
taken and 0.6278 gram of solids were obtained, or 14.58 per cent. 
In determining the solids in the exterior liquor, 3.586 grams were 
used and the dried solids obtained were 0.2142 gram, or 5.97 per cent. 

Then the total solids in the exterior liquor equal 5.79 per cent, 
of 65 grams, or 3.8805, and the total solids in the drained oysters is 
equal to 14.58 per cent, of 445, or 64.881 grams, making a total of 
68.7615 grams of solids in the original sample of oysters weighing 
510 grams, or 13.48 per cent. 

From the above work, the report would be as follows : 

Water in drained oysters 85.42% 

Solids in drained oysters 14.58% 

Solids in exterior liquor 5.79% 

Water in oysters as sold on the market 86.52% 

Solids in oysters as sold on the market 13.48% 

The following determinations were made from oysters as sold on 
the market, and they were all adulterated with the possible exception 
of number seven.

The process of " floating " oysters is given by Wiley 1 as follows: 

" Reference has already been made to the practice of soaking 
oysters in fresh water for the purpose of making them more plump 
and increasing their weight. This, in the language of the fisherman, 
is called " floating," " drinking," or " laying out." By this proc- 
ess the body of the oyster affects a plumpness and largeness which 
materially increases its selling qualities, as it increases its weight 
and size and, therefore, the profits of the dealer. The principle of 
this process depends upon the fact that when a soft substance like an 
oyster, containing a mineral salt in its composition, is brought in con- 
tact with water, a process of diffusion takes place, which is known, in 
chemical physics, as osmosis, whereby water passes through the cell 
walls and enters the cells of the oyster and the mineral substance 
thereof is forced out into the external water. Larger volumes of 
water pass into the cells than accompany the particles of mineral 
matter to the outside of the cells and the result is a swelling of the 
oyster and a consequent increase in the size and weight by the addi- 
tion of pure water, but at the expense of the natural salt, mostly 
chloride of sodium or common salt, which the oyster contains." 

United States Department of Agriculture F. I. D. 110 states that " It 
is unlawful to ship, or to sell in interstate commerce, oysters or other 
shellfish which have been subjected to " floating " or " drinking " 
in brackish water, or water containing less salt than that in which 
they are grown." 

Preservatives. The methods of detecting formaldehyde and boric 
acid have already been described in this chapter and they apply 
equally as well to oysters as other flesh foods. 

Lowe, 2 in 1897, called attention to the fact that oysters as a rule 
contained copper, and Willard, 3 after having examined a large number 
of samples, concluded that copper is a normal constituent of oysters 
and states, "It is not improbable that, especially with susceptible

individuals, those oysters containing the larger quantities of copper 
might be a cause of illness." 

Willard determines the copper in oysters by digesting the oysters 
in a Kjeldahl flask with sulphuric acid the same as in the determina- 
tion of nitrogen. The clear solution is diluted and the copper de- 
posited electrolytically. 

Notices of judgment have been published by U. S. Department 
of Agriculture in reference to oysters as follows:

CHAPTER VIII. 



EGGS AND EGG SUBSTITUTES. 

The food analyst has mostly to do with eggs in the desiccated form, 
although at times it will be necessary to candle eggs as well as to make 
a chemical analysis. 

This subject will be considered under three divisions: 

1. Whole Eggs. 

2. Desiccated Eggs. 

3. Egg Substitutes. 

An egg, unless otherwise stated, will be considered a hen egg. 

The average weight of an egg is about 680 grams, 1 or, If pounds 
per dozen. 

An egg consists of three general divisions, that is, shell, white and 
yolk. 

The average composition of eggs and egg products is as follows: 2

Whole Eggs. Whole eggs are most commonly examined by " can- 
dling." The result of candling one lot of eggs by the Bureau of Chem- 
istry is given in Notice of Judgment No. 3409, as follows:

The terms used in reference to the quality of eggs are defined by 
Stiles 1 as follows: 

(1) Firsts and Extras. This grade includes all freshly laid, sound, 
whole, clean shell, medium, and good-sized eggs. The best eggs of 
the year are laid during the spring months, and it is this grade which 
is usually selected for storage, to be removed some months later for 
the winter trade. The extras are selected from this grade, to suit 
local demands of the city in which the eggs are to be sold. For ex- 
ample, a large, clean shell, whole, brown egg would be selected for 
markets in the vicinity of Boston; while, on the other hand, a large, 
clean shell, whole, white egg would be preferable for New York markets 
the quality of the goods being the same in each case. 

(2) Seconds. Into this group enter all the grades not included 
under " Firsts," except the " spots " and " rots." This group may 
be further subdivided into others. Generally this grade contains all 
the under-sized, dirty, checked, cracked shell, or weak eggs, which 
could not be classed as ''Firsts": 

(a) Undersized: Eggs which may be classed as firsts except for 
their size. 

(b) Checks and Cracks: Eggs, the shells of which have become 
broken by careless handling, but which have intact shell membranes. 

(c) Leakers : Eggs whose shells and shell membranes are sufficiently 
broken to permit a portion of their contents to escape. 

(d) Dirties: Eggs, the shells of which have become soiled from un- 
clean nests, etc. 

(e) Weak Eggs: In this grade are placed all eggs in which the al- 
bumen has become weak or watery due to high or varying temperature 
changes. 

1 U. S. Dept. Agr., Bur. of Chem., Bui. 158, 12. 



EGGS AND EGG SUBSTITUTES. 291 

All the above-mentioned grades are considered to be suitable for 
food purposes when handled under proper conditions, except the 
" leakers," which are generally badly contaminated. 

(3) Spots and Rots. This grade comprises all of the discards and is 
considered useful only for manufacturing purposes, such as for tanning 
leather, etc. They are eggs which show a spot before the candle. 
These spots may be due to developing embryos, blood rings, or molds, 
or by the attachment of the yolk to the shell, which may be caused 
by holding in one position. 

In addition to the above, other terms are used, such as white rot 
(sour rot), when the white and yolk are just beginning to mix; stale, 
when the shell shows an enlarged air space and the yolk has gained in 
opacity and fallen to the pointed end of the shell; spot rot eggs in 
which the yolk becomes adherent to one or both of the shell mem- 
sbranes; moldy eggs on candling show dense black areas of varying 
sizes inside the shell; light spot-eggs which have been incubated suffi- 
ciently to show a small darkened area. 

Whole eggs consist of 11 per cent, shell, having the following average 
composition: 

Calcium carbonate 93.7 

Magnesium carbonate 1.3 

Calcium phosphate 0.8 

Organic matter 4.2 

Flavor of eggs depends upon the food consumed by the hen. When 
onions are fed to hens their eggs have a very disagreeable flavor. 

Color. The color of the yolk also depends to a certain extent upon 
the food. Hens eating the larvae and pupae of the locusts lay eggs 
with the yolk a deep red color. 1 The color of the yolk may be changed 
by feeding the hens coal-tar dyes. 

Notice of Judgment No. 1043 was a case of whole-shelled eggs which 
were preserved with boric acid and No. 1202 were whole-shelled eggs, 
62.5 per cent, of which were spot eggs and 37.5 per cent, fair grade. 

Eggs in cold storage one year lose 10 per cent, of their weight 
(mostly water from the whites), after 16.5 months they lose their 
power of cohesion and emit a characteristic musty odor a few hours 
after opening. 

Preserved Eggs. Eggs preserved with sodium silicate solution 
(water glass) should be sold as preserved eggs and not as strictly 
fresh. 

According to Bartlett 2 eggs preserved in water glass of the proper

strength are much superior to cold storage eggs, as they do not lose 
in moisture content, the ash remains constant, and they do not ab- 
sorb bad odors or flavors as the pores of the shells are closed. It is 
necessary for the water glass to be of a definite strength and not con- 
tain free sodium hydroxide. Bartlett recommends the preparation 
of water glass as follows: 24.2 parts of SiO 2 to 8.89 parts Na0 2 made 
into the glass by the dry process, then dissolved by superheated steam 
and made up to a syrup testing 38 degrees B. One part of this syrup 
to nine parts of water makes a solution of about 0.045 specific gravity 
and is recommended as the proper strength of solution to use. 

Eggs with blood rings are considered adulterated and the Govern- 
ment prohibits interstate shipment of such eggs unless they are to be 
used for technical purposes only, and in that case they must be de- 
natured before shipment. 

It is a common practice for disreputable dealers to sell cold storage 
eggs for fresh as will be seen by the number of Federal Notices of 
Judgment where storage eggs have been sold for fresh. 

There has also been many cases of frozen eggs which have been sold 
as pure which were made up of wholly or partly filthy, decomposed or 
putrid animal or vegetable matter. 

Desiccated Eggs, Egg Powder, Dried Eggs. Eggs in this form are 
sold in large quantities to bakers and confectioners, as well as in small 
packages at retail. When sold in small packages a statement is 
printed on the label claiming that the package represents a certain 
number of eggs. Owing to the size of eggs produced from different 
breed of hens varying to a considerable extent the average weight of 
eggs should be taken as the standard. 

According to Federal Notices of Judgment, egg powder or desiccated 
egg is produced in enormous quantities from eggs that are decomposed 
and filthy, and this material is sold to and used by bakers and others 
in large quantities. 

White of egg makes up about 57 per cent, of the whole egg. The 
egg white has the following composition: l 

Water 82 to 88 per cent. 

Solids 13.3 per cent. (mean) 

Proteids 12.2 per cent. " 

Sugar 0.5 per cent. " 

Fats, alkaline soaps, lecithin, cholesterin, traces 

Inorganic residue 0.66 per cent.

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



Egg Substitutes. Egg substitutes are prepared at times very in- 
geniously by mixing casein, fat and coloring in proportion to yield 
the amount of protein and fat usually found in pure dried eggs, but 
more often they are very crude imitations of eggs and consist mainly 
of starch and coloring matter. 

Federal Service and Regulatory Announcement No. 23 states that 
" Egg Powder " should not appear upon a product which contains 
no eggs, and that a product which is labeled to indicate that it will take 
the place of eggs should possess the properties of eggs, both in re- 
spect to food value and baking qualities. 

Notices of Judgments Nos. 2478, and 2479 give the analysis of two 
samples of Egg-O-Let. A compilation of the results of analysis, 
together with one analysis made of the same preparation by the author, 
and the composition claimed by the manufacturer, follows :

" Adulteration of the product was alleged in the information for 
the reason that a certain substance, to wit, a product consisting of 
wheat starch, corn starch, and peanut was substituted wholly or in 
part for what the article, by its label, purported to be, that is to say, 
' dried egg product V The preparation was also artificially colored. 

Many substances are used in the preparation of egg substitutes, 
such as, casein, albumen, peanuts, starches, milk powder, sodium 
phosphate, sodium chloride, sugar, and dyes. 

Preparations for use in manufacturing egg substitutes are sold under 
coined names, such as, Krystalak and Cremora. 

Krystalak, or the so-called dried milk, gave upon analysis the follow- 
ing data. The composition claimed by the manufacturer is also

Krystalak appears to be mostly, if not wholly, a skimmed milk

Cremora appears to be dried whole milk. An analysis gave the 
following results :

Egg-Like is supposed to contain both Cremora and Krystalak. An 
analysis of Egg-Like gave the following results : 

Water 4.99 

Fat 8.55 

Ash 8.56 

Protein 25.81 

Starch and sugar 52.09 

With the high-grade egg substitutes containing fifty per cent, or 
more of dried egg, properly labeled so that the consumer will not be 
deceived, there should not be any particular objection to their sale; 
however, the egg substitutes consisting mainly of starch and artificial 
coloring are certainly to be condemned. 

Analysis of Egg Substitutes. In the analysis of egg substitutes 
the regular methods that have already been given for the determina- 
tion of water, starch, protein and fat (ether extract) in other sub- 
stances are used. 

Egg Albumen in Baking Powders. In a case where albumen had 
been used in the manufacture of a baking powder, part of the decision 
of the judge was as follows: l 

The plaintiff is a large manufacturer of baking powder. In its product it inserts 
15/100 of one per cent, of dried white of egg. Thig substance serves no useful pur- 
pose in the leavening quality of the powder, or in any article of food in which baking 
powder is used. Its sole object is to adapt plaintiff's powder to the so-called 'water 
glass test.' The leavening property of baking powder consists of carbon dioxide 
gas. This is given off by all such powders when they are brought in contact with 
water. In dough the gas is sufficiently confined to cause the dough to rise. If, 
however, water alone is added to the powder, the gas is given off, and quickly escapes 
into the air unless some element is present to confine it. That is the object of egg 
albumen. It forms a thin, viscous layer, which confines the gas. The so-called 
water glass test consists in mixing two teaspoonfuls of baking powder in a like quan- 
tity of water in an ordinary water glass. When this is done, the gas is given off, the 
mixture foams and rises in the glass. In the case of baking powders which contain 
no egg albumen, a large part of the gas escapes and the mixture quickly collapses. 
In the case of baking powders which contain egg albumen, a thin, viscous film is 

1 Am. Food J., 1916, 11, 295. 



296 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

formed on the surface, by which the gas is confined and the expanding mixture is 
made to register in the glass the quantity of gas contained in the powder. It is 
conceded that plaintiff's powder complies in every way with the food laws of the 
state, unless the adding of white of egg causes it to offend. It is also conceded that 
the white of egg used by the plaintiff is wholesome, and that its presence in the 
baking powder does not render the product less wholesome as an article of food. 

What, then, is the ground of complaint against the plaintiff's baking powder? 
It is this: "the addition of the egg albumen enables plaintiff and its salesmen and 
demonstrators to use water glass test. This test does not show that plaintiff's 
baking powder is any better than it is in fact; but it does make it possible to cause all 
baking powders which do not use white of egg to appear, in comparison with plain- 
tiff's powder, to be less efficient than they are. This is due to the fact that in the 
plaintiff's powder, the gas is confined by egg albumen, whereas in other baking 
powders it is permitted to escape. 

By the above decision it would appear that a small quantity of egg 
albumen would not be of value in a baking powder, but after a series 
of experiments by Jackson 1 he concludes that although under normal 
conditions egg albumen is of no particular value in as small portions 
as 0.1 to 0.2 per cent., when the temperature of the oven is too low 
for baking biscuits properly, egg albumen seems to aid in producing 
a better biscuit, and when the dough is allowed to stand several hours 
before baking, a much better biscuit is produced by the powder to 
which egg albumen has been added.

CHAPTER IX. 
VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 

Parry 1 states " An absolutely scientific definition of the term 
' Essential or Volatile Oils ' is hardly possible, but for all practical 
purposes they may be defined as odoriferous bodies of an oily nature 
obtained from vegetable sources, generally liquid (sometimes semi- 
solid or solid) at ordinary temperatures, and volatile without decom- 
position." 

Allen 2 gives the following method for the manufacture of essential 
oils. 

(a) By pressure, as the oils of laurel, lemon, and bergamot. 

(b) By distillation with water, or by passing a current of steam 
through the matter to be extracted. This is the most common and 
generally applicable method. 

(c) By fermentation and distillation, as, for instance, with the 
essential oils of mustard, and bitter almonds, the seeds containing no 
ready-formed oil, but the latter being produced when the crushed 
seeds are left in contact with water, owing to the influence of peculiar 
nitrogenized ferments, the oil formed being then separated by distilla- 
tion with water. 

(d) By solution in a fixed oil devoid of odor, such as olive oil, or 
lard (the " enfleurage " process). The scents of various plants are 
extracted in this manner. 

Many of the oxygenated and sulphureted constituents of essential 
oils have been prepared synthetically, such as volatile oil of mustard. 

In preparing essential oils by expression other substances than the 
oil are produced. The fluid generally consists of oil, water and various 
substances dissolved in the water, or held in suspension and it is 
necessary to let the liquid stand in tall, narrow vessels for a few days 
until it separates in two layers, oil on top and water below. Separate 
the oil and filter without exposure to air. 

When oils are produced by distillation a copper cage is generally 
used to suspend the plant substance in the still; otherwise the plant 
might be burnt and the oil would have a disagreeable empyreumatic 
odor.

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 299 

Volatile oils are sometimes produced by extraction, with a solvent 
of low boiling point, by simply percolating and then recovering the 
solvent by distillation. 

When volatile oils are produced by using a non-volatile solvent, 
the fat is heated on a water bath and the freshly gathered flowers 
thrown in and left twelve to twenty-four hours, with frequent stirring. 
When the odor of the flowers has been absorbed they are removed and 
a fresh lot of flowers thrown in. This is repeated until the pomade 
has the desired odor. The perfume is obtained by dissolving out the 
volatile oil with alcohol, from which it can be carefully distilled or 
used directly as a perfume. 

Composition of Volatile Oils. The official volatile oils contain 
principally terpenes, aldehydes, ketones, acids, phenols, alcohols and 
sulphur compounds. 

Acids. Benzoic, salicylic, cinnamic and acetic acids are found in 
essential oils usually as esters. Hydrocyanic acid occurs in the free 
state in oil of bitter almonds. 

Alcohols. Of the higher alcohols menthol and bornyl, secondary 
alcohols, and santalol are found in the official volatile oils. 

Oil of peppermint should contain not less than 50 per cent, of 
menthol, oil of rosemary not less than 10 per cent, of bornyl, and oil 
of sandalwood not less than 90 per cent, of santalol. 

The method of determining menthol, bornyl and santalol in volatile 
oils by acetylization and saponification of the acetylized oil will be 
found described under the treatment of the oils containing such 
constituents. 

Aldehydes. Aldehydes are derived from the primary alcohols by 
the removal of two hydrogen from the CH 2 OH group, thus : 



H.CH 2 OH- H 2 = 

(methyl alcohol) (formaldehyde) 

A few samples of oils containing aldehydes follow: Oil of bitter 
almonds, which should contain not less than 85 per cent, benzalde- 
hyde; oil of cinnamon, with not less than 80 per cent, of cinnamic 
aldehyde, and oil of lemon, which should contain not less than 4 per 
cent, of citral, an aldehyde of geraniol. 

No general method of estimating aldehydes in essential oils is 
applicable and the different oils have to be treated separately, there- 
fore the methods of determination of aldehydes will be given 
under the oil to which they apply. 

Ketones. When a primary alcohol is oxidized it yields an aldehyde, 
while oxidized secondary alcohols yield ketones. Ketones are found 
in two official volatile oils. Oil of caraway should contain not less 



300 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

than 50 per cent, of the ketone carvone CioHi 4 O, and oil of spearmint 
should contain not less than 43 per cent, of carvone. Carvone is 
determined by the sulphite method which will be found in the text 
under oil of caraway. 

Phenols. A number of official oils contain aromatic phenols. Oil 
of cloves should contain not less than 82 per cent, and oil of allspice 
not less than 65 per cent, of eugenol (CioHi 2 2 ). Oil of thyme should 
contain not less than 20 per cent, of thymol. 

The method of assay of oils containing phenols depends upon the 
solubility of phenols in a solution of potassium or sodium hydroxide. 

Sulphur Compounds. Sulphur compounds are detected by boiling 
the sample with lead acetate solution and an excess of caustic soda, 
when a black lead sulphide separates. Oil of mustard consists prin- 
cipally of allyl isothiocyanate (C 3 H 5 SCN). 

Terpenes. A large class of essential oils contain terpenes (CioHie). 
They appear under various names such as pinene, which occurs as 
dextrorotatory in oil of turpentine produced from the long leaf pine 
in the southern part of the United States, and levorotatory in the 
oil of turpentine produced in the north from Norway pine. Pinene 
is also found in oil of lemon, and oil of cubebs is mostly terpenes and 
sesquiterpenes. 

Analysis of Volatile Oils. 

In the analysis of volatile oils a number of determinations are 
necessary to detect adulterations, only a few of which will be men- 
tioned here as the text will furnish methods more in detail. 

Specific Gravity. Of the three physical examinations specific 
gravity, polarization and refractive index the specific gravity is of 
the most importance. 

The specific gravity should be carefully taken with a pycnometer 
and expressed as the" ratio of the weight of a volume of the oil to that 
of an equal volume of pure water, both at 25 C., thus: d25 C./d25 C. 

This temperature can be easily obtained by using a pycnometer 
provided with a thermometer and cap. Fill the pycnometer and then 
insert the thermometer and hold the pycnometer in the hand until 
the temperature is exactly 25 C. then replace the cap and carefully 
remove the overflow of oil and weigh. 

Polarization. The optical rotation of volatile oils should not be 
omitted as it often serves as a quantitative test, especially in mix- 
tures of oil and alcohol, and often the polarization, alone, indicates 
purity or adulteration. 

Refractive Index. The refractive index of volatile oils is quite 
essential in an analysis for adulteration. The refractive index should 
be taken at 20 C. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. [301 

Acidity. The acidity is determined by dissolving 5 grams of the 
volatile oil in 20 cc. of neutral alcohol and titrating with decinormal 
alkali, using phenolphthalein as indicator. 

One cc. of N/10 alkali is equal to: 

0.0060 gram of acetic acid, 
0.0102 gram of valeric acid. 
0.0122 gram of benzoic acid. 
0.0148 gram of cinnamic acid. 
0.0164 gram of coumaric acid. 
0.0138 gram of salicylic acid. 
0.0168 gram of vanillic acid. 

Esters. Compound ethers, etheral salts or esters contain both an 
alcohol radical and an acid radical. Esters may be a combination 
of alcohols with mineral acids, but in case of volatile oils the esters 
are all of organic acids. Oil of mustard which should contain not 
less than 92 per cent, of allyl isothiocyanate (C 3 H 5 SCN) is a notable 
example of a volatile oil which is largely composed of an ester. Oil 
of rosemary contains the ester bornyl acetate and oil of peppermint 
contains the ester menthol acetate. 

In the determination of esters of essential oils, N/2 alcoholic potas- 
sium hydroxide is used to saponify the esters. Each cc. of N/2 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide used represents the following: 

0.09808 gram of bornyl acetate. 
0.044 gram of ethyl acetate. 
0.09808 gram of linalyl acetate. 
0.07603 gram of methyl salicylate. 
0.09909 gram of menthyl acetate. 

It also represents : 

0.07707 gram of borneol. 
0.07808 gram of menthol. 
0.111105 gram of santalol. 

Iodine Absorption Value of Volatile Oils. Although the iodine 
absorption value of volatile oils is not generally determined, it is in 
some cases of considerable importance, more especially in the analysis 
of gum and wood turpentines. 

Added Alcohol. When alcohol is added as an adulterant to volatile 
oils in large quantities it may be roughly determined by agitating the 
oil with water in a graduated, stoppered cylinder, and then allowing 
the oil to separate. The decrease in the amount of oil taken will 
indicate the amount of alcohol present. Small quantities of alcohol 
are detected by distilling a small portion and applying the iodoform 
test.

OLEUM AMYGDALAE AMARAE. 
Oil of Bitter Almond. 

Essence d'amandes ameres, Fr. Bittermandelol, G. 

A volatile oil obtained by maceration and distillation from the 
ripe kernels of Prunus Amygdalus amara DeCandolle (Fam. Rosaceae), 
and from other kernels containing amygdalin. It yields not less than 
85 per cent, of benzaldehyde (C 7 H 6 0) and not less than 2 per cent, nor 
more than 4 per cent, of hydrocyanic acid (HCN). U. S. P. It should 
not be dispensed if the oil shows crystals of benzoic acid. Almonds 
are indigenous to Syria and cultivated in California.

306 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Principal Components. Benzaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid and ap- 
proximately 0.2 per cent, of a yellow oil, heavier than water, and 
having an agreeable, characteristic odor. (Dodge. 1 ) 

Preparation and Yield. The volatile oil of almond does not exist, 
as such, ready-formed in the kernels, but results from the action of 
water on the glucoside amygdalin, under the influence of the natural 
ferment emulsin, present in the kernels. The reaction is represented 
as follows : 

C 2 oH 27 NOn + 2H 2 = C 7 H 6 O + 2C 6 H 12 O 6 + HCN 
Amygdalin Benzal- Dextrose Hydrocyanic 

dehyde Acid 

In the manufacture of volatile oil of almond the fixed oil is first 
expressed from the kernels and then the pressed cakes are ground and 
soaked with water for twenty-four hours. The large quantity of 
albuminoids present often cause excessive frothing, and to remedy 
this the pressed cakes are coarsely powdered and immersed into 
boiling water to coagulate the albuminoids and dissolve the amygdalin. 
The ferment emulsin, being rendered inactive by the boiling water, 
it becomes necessary to add emulsin of the fresh cake after cooling. 
After the emulsin has converted the amygdalin into essential oil the 
mixture is distilled. 

The distilled oil consists mainly of benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic 
acid. Oil of almond free from hydrocyanic acid may be procured at 
an advance in price. The oil produced from almond, apricot and 
peach kernels is practically identical. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of almond is assayed for benzaldehyde 
and hydrocyanic acid as given in the United States Pharmacopoeia, 
as follows: 

Assay for Benzaldehyde. Dissolve about 3 cc. of freshly redistilled 
phenylhydrazine in 60 cc. of alcohol and titrate 25 cc. of this solution, 
which must always be freshly prepared, with half-normal hydrochloric 
acid V.S., using methyl orange T.S. as indicator. To about one gram 
of the oil of bitter almond, accurately weighed, add 25 cc. of phenyl- 
hydrazine solution, just prepared, and allow it to stand for thirty 
minutes. Add a drop of methyl orange T.S., and acidify the mixture 
by adding a measured excess of half -normal hydrochloric acid V.S. 
Filter the mixture and wash the precipitate with small portions of 
distilled water until the washings cease to redden blue litmus paper. 
Then titrate the excess of hydrochloric acid in the filtrate with half- 
normal potassium hydroxide V.S. and subtract the number of cc. of 
the half-normal hydrochloric acid V.S. used in titrating the 25 cc. of 

1 Eighth Int. Cong. Appl. Chem., 1912, 17, 15. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 307 

phenylhydrazine solution. The difference multiplied by 0.053 gives 
the weight of benzaldehyde. 

Assay for Hydrocyanic Acid. Dissolve 15 grams of crystallized 
magnesium sulphate in enough distilled water to measure 100 cc.; 
add 5 cc. of this solution to 40 cc. distilled water; then add 5 cc. half- 
normal sodium hydroxide V.S. and two drops of potassium chromate 
T.S., and titrate the solution with tenth-normal silver nitrate V.S. to 
the production of a permanent reddish tint. Pour this mixture into 
a 100 cc. flask containing about 1 gram of oi] of bitter almond, ac- 
curately weighed, mix well and titrate again with tenth-normal silver 
nitrate V.S. until a red tint, which does not disappear on shaking, is 
reproduced. Conduct this titration as rapidly as possible. 

One cc. of tenth-normal silver nitrate V.S. corresponds to 0.0027 
grams of hydrocyanic acid. One gram of the oil corresponds to not 
less than 7.4 cc. nor more than 14.8 cc. of tenth-normal silver nitrate 
V.S. 

Presence of Hydrocyanic Acid in oil of almond may be detected by 
dissolving 10 drops of the oil in alcohol and then adding a few drops 
of sodium hydroxide solution and 2 drops ferrous sulphate solution 
and the same amount of ferric chloride solution; warm and add a 
slight excess of hydrochloric acid, when a blue precipitate will be 
produced in presence of hydrocyanic acid. 

Chlorinated Products are tested for in oil of almond as follows: A 
loop of clean copper wire is heated in a non-luminous flame until 
it glows without coloring the flame green. The wire is cooled and 
then dipped into the oil of almond. The oil on the wire is ignited 
and burned by holding the wire just outside of the non-luminous flame. 
A tinge of green would indicate the presence of chlorinated products. 

The above test, if positive, would indicate benzaldehyde, but as 
benzaldehyde may be obtained free of chlorinated products, the 
absence of chlorinated products does not necessarily prove the absence 
of the artificial product. The United States Pharmacopoeia VIII 
contained the following test for chlorinated products: A small filter 
paper taper is saturated with oil of bitter almond and placed in a small 
porcelain dish. The taper is ignited and a clean beaker, moistened 
on the inner surface, is inverted over the burning taper. The prod- 
ucts of combustion will be absorbed by the water. Rinse the beaker 
with a little water, filter, and to the filtrate add a drop or two of silver 
nitrate solution, a slight turbidity appears, which should disappear 
on boiling. (Absence of artificial oils containing chlorinated products.) 

Nitrobenzene is detected by the Pharmacopoeial test as follows: 
A few drops of the oil are added to a little alcohol and the mixture 
boiled with a small amount of zinc dust and acetic acid. No odor of

In addition to the phenylhydrazine method of assaying benzalde- 
hyde, a number of other methods have been proposed, such as the 
bisulphite and alkali. Dodge 2 reports the best results are obtained 
by the bisulphite method under the following conditions: " 0.15 gram 
aldehyde is weighed into a flask containing exactly 25 cc. of about 
N/5 sodium bisulphite and dissolved by gentle shaking. The flask 
is corked and let stand one and one-half to two hours in ice water. 
It is then titrated, ice-cold, with N/10 iodine, and starch indicator. 
A blank test of 25 cc. of bisulphite solution is treated in all respects 
similarly. The amount of iodine used in the assay is subtracted from 
that used in the blank, and the difference calculated to benzaldehyde 
(1 cc. N/10 iodine = .0053 benzaldehyde). The end point is assumed 
to be when the blue color is permanent for a few seconds." 

The reaction is represented as follows : 

C 6 H 5 -COH + Na 2 SO 3 + H 2 = C 6 H 5 COH.NaHS0 3 + NaOH. 

In applying the alkali method, Dodge recommends the use of 2.5 N

alcoholic potassium hydroxide and allows the mixture to stand at room 
temperature for 24 hours in preference to heating for a shorter time. 

This method was not very satisfactory in the determination of 
benzaldehyde in oil of bitter almond as the saponification of the nitril 
to mandelic acid appeared to be incomplete, and the end reaction 
with phenolphthalein was uncertain. 

The reaction of benzaldehyde with strong alkali is represented as 
follows : 

2C 6 H 5 COH + KOH = C 6 H 5 COOK + C 6 H 5 -CH 2 OH.

Almond Extract. 

Almond extract should contain one per cent, of almond oil and the 
qualitative and quantitative methods for detection and determination 
of hydrocyanic acid are the same as for oil of almond. In the deter- 
mination of hydrocyanic acid in the extract 25 cc. of the sample 
should be used. 

In the determination of benzaldehyde, A. 0. A. C. method directs 
that the phenylhydrazine should be dissolved in acetic acid instead of 
in alcohol, and the determination is made gravimetrically instead of 
volumetrically. The details are as follows: 

Reagent: Phenylhydrazin Solution. Add 1.5 cc. of glacial acetic 
acid to 20 cc. of water and mix with 1 cc. phenylhydrazin. 

Determination. Measure out two portions of 10 cc. each of the 
extract into 300 cc. Erlenmeyer flasks and add 10 cc. of phenylhydrazin 
solution to one flask and 15 cc. to the other. Allow to stand over 
night in a dark place, add 200 cc. of water and filter on a tared Gooch 
crucible, provided with a thin layer of asbestos. Wash first with 
cold water, finally with 10 cc. of 10 per cent, alcohol, and dry for three 
hours in a vacuum oven at 70 C., or to constant weight, over sulphuric 
acid. The weight of the precipitate multiplied by the factor 5.408 
gives the weight of benzaldehyde in 100 cc. of the sample. If dupli- 



310 PHARMACEUTICAL. AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

cate determinations do not agree, repeat the operation using a larger 
quantity of the phenylhydrazin solution. 

Alcohol Determination. The alcohol is generally calculated from 
the specific gravity of the extract. If the extract contains solids the 
alcohol should be determined as follows: Add 25 cc. of the extract, 
measured at 25 C. to 75 cc. of saturated sodium chloride solution 
in a separatory funnel and extract twice with 50 cc. portions of petro- 
leum ether (B.P. 40 to 60 C.). Collect the petroleum ether in a 
second separatory funnel and wash twice with two portions (25 cc.) 
of saturated brine. Combine the original salt solution with the 
washings; add a little powdered pumice and distil into a 100 cc. flask. 
When almost 100 cc. have been distilled, make up to the mark with 
water at 25 C. and obtain the percentage of alcohol from the alcohol 
specific gravity tables. 

Benzaldehyde. An aldehyde produced synthetically or obtained 
from oil of bitter almond and containing not less than 85 per cent, of 
C 7 H 6 or C 6 H 5 CHO (106.05). U. S. P. 

Oil of bitter almond is adulterated with benzaldehyde and in many 
cases the pure benzaldehyde is used for oil of bitter almond. When 
the proper amount of hydrocyanic acid, to conform to the official 
requirements, is added to benzaldehyde, it is practically impossible 
to differentiate between the true and artificial products. 

Preparation. The synthetic benzaldehyde is prepared from chlori- 
nated derivatives of toluene thus: 1 part of benzyl chloride, 1| parts 
of lead nitrate or copper nitrate and 10 parts of water are boiled, 
under a reflux condenser, for some time. Carbon dioxide is passed 
through the apparatus to prevent oxidation. Finally, half the liquid 
is distilled and the benzaldehyde which separates in the distillate is 
purified. 

Another method of preparing synthetic benzaldehyde is by boiling 
a mixture of benzyl chloride and benzyl dichloride with water and 
manganese dioxide under a reflux condenser. The reaction is repre- 
sented as follows: 

2C 6 H 5 .CH 2 C1 + C 6 H 5 .CHC1 2 + 2Mn0 2 

= 3C 6 H 5 .CHO + 2MnCl 2 + H 2 O. 

Benzaldehyde may also be prepared by shaking oil of bitter almond 
with concentrated solution of sodium acid sulphite benzyl hydroxy- 
sulphonate of sodium (C 6 H 5 CH(OH)S0 2 ONa), a crystalline substance 
being formed. The benzaldehyde is separated by treatment with a 
strong solution of sodium carbonate and finally purified by distillation. 

Uses. Benzaldehyde is used in the synthetic preparation of benzoic 
acid as well as a substitute for oil of bitter almond. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 311 

Properties and Tests. Benzaldehyde is a colorless, or yellowish, 
strongly refractive liquid, having a bitter-almond-like odor, and a 
burning, aromatic taste. 

It is slightly soluble in water, miscible with alcohol, ether, or volatile 
oils. 

Specific gravity: about 1.045 at 25 C. U. S. P. 

It should conform to the tests given under oil of bitter almond, 
as to the absence of chlorinated products and nitrobenzene. It should 
not contain hydrocyanic acid. (See above test for hydrocyanic 
acid.)

Hooker filius (Fam. Magnoliaceae). The botanical source from which 
it is derived must be stated on the label. U. S. P. 

Oil of anise is produced in France, Russia and other European 
countries.

Soluble in 3 volumes 90% alcohol. 

Principal Components. Anethol 80 to 90 per cent., methyl chavicol 
and an optically inactive substance, having the odor of aniseed oil, 
but lacking its sweet taste. 1 The old oil contains anisaldehyde, 
anisic acid and polymeric anethols. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of anise is produced mostly in Russia, 
and by steam distillation. The yield is from 1J to 6 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of anise is a colorless or pale yellow, 
strongly refractive liquid, having the characteristic odor and taste 
of anise. U. S. P. 

Aniseed oil has been found adulterated with 35 per cent, spermaceti, 
80 per cent, alcohol, as well as being mixed with kerosene, wax, oils 
of fennel, cedar, copaiba, camphor, turpentine, fennel stearoptene 
and oil of caraway obtained from both the seed and the chaff. 2 

Most, if not all, of the above adulterants would be detected by the 
determination of the constants of aniseed oil. 

As solid material often separates, the oil should be gently warmed 
and thoroughly mixed before dispensing or making an analysis. 

The value of anise oil depends upon its content of anethol, which 
should not be less than 80 per cent. The anethol is approximately 
determined by cooling the oil to a low temperature, and after crystal- 
lization has taken place, pressing the crystals between blotting paper; 
then weighing the anethol thus obtained. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia IX gives a congealing test as 
follows : 

Transfer about 10 cc. of the oil to a test tube, place it in a water bath cooled with 
ice, insert a thermometer at once into the oil and allow it to remain undisturbed 
until the temperature has fallen to about 12 C. Then induce crystallization either 
by rubbing the inner wall of the test tube with the thermometer or by the addition 
of a particle of solid anethol, remove the test tube from the bath and stir during the 
solidification of the oil. The highest temperature reached during the crystallization 
is regarded as the congealing point and should not fall below 15 C.

314 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

A volatile oil obtained by expression from the fresh peel of sweet 
orange, Citrus Aurantium sinensis Gallesio (Fam. Rutaceae), and 
its varieties. Preserve it in small, well-stoppered, amber-colored 
bottles, in a cool place, protected from light. Oil of orange having 
a terebinthinate odor is not to be dispensed. U. S. P. 

Orange oil is produced in the Mediterranean countries as well as 
in California, Florida and Cuba. There were imported into the United 
States during the year ending June 30, 1920, 282,349 pounds of orange 
oil. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.842 to 0.846 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4723 to 1.4737 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C not less than +94 

Optical rotation of first 10% of distillate at least 1 
greater than the original oil. 

Principal Components, d-limonene, 90 to 95 per cent., a small 
amount of citral, citronellal, and methyl anthranilate (methyl ester 
of ortho-amido benzoic acid). 1 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared from orange peel by the 
same methods as are given for the preparation of oil of lemon. The 
yield varies, however; Hood 2 has obtained from Florida oranges from 
0.99 to 3.26 per cent, calculated upon the weight of peel. The amount 
varied as to the varieties and time of year the fruit was picked and 
the oil distilled. The oil was distilled with water in the ordinary 
Remington still. The distilled oil is said to be of inferior quality 
compared with the expressed. 

Federal Standard. 

Oil of Orange is the volatile oil obtained, by expression or alcoholic solution, from 
the fresh peel of the orange (Citrus aurantium L.) and has an optical rotation (25 C.) 
of not less than +95 in a 100 millimeter tube. 

Turpenkss Oil of Orange is oil of orange from which all or nearly all of the terpens 
have been removed. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of orange is a yellow liquid having the 
characteristic odor and taste of orange peel. 

Adulteration with other essential oils would lower the polarization 
as orange oil has the highest polarization of the volatile oils. 

For the detection of oil of turpentine the sample is subjected to 
fractional distillation. The pinene, having a low boiling point, will 
come over mostly in the first fraction and will polarize to the right 
if the adulteration is with American turpentine, and to the left in 
case the French oil is present.

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS.

When orange oil is distilled at the ordinary pressure the first 10 per 
cent, of a pure oil will have an optical rotation greater than that of 
the original oil by at least 1. If the rise is less than 1 the oil may be 
suspected of containing either oil of lemon or the terpenes therefrom. 1 

The U. S. P. test for purity is to take the refractive index and 
optical rotation of the first five cc. of the distillate from 50 cc. 

Introduce 50 cc. of oil of orange into a 200 mm., three-bulb, Ladenburg flask of 
approximately the following dimensions: The lower main bulb 6 cm. in diameter 
with the smaller condensing bulbs 3.5 cm., 3.0 cm. and 2.5 cm. in diameter, respec- 
tively; with the distance from the bottom of the flask to the side arm 20 cm. Then 
distill the oil at the rate of one drop per second until 5 cc. has been obtained. The 
angle of rotation of the distillate thus obtained is equal to, or slightly greater than 
that of the original oil, and the refractive index of this portion, at 20 C., is not less 
than 0.0008 nor more than 0.0015 lower than that of the original oil at 20 C.

316 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

The pure oil boils at from 173 to 175 C. On fractional distilla- 
tion, 20 per cent, is obtained at 173 to 175 C.; 61 per cent, from 175 
to 178 C.; 14 per cent, between 178 and 188 C.; leaving a residue 
of 5 per cent. 

The oil of bitter orange, from Citrus bigaradia, sweet orange, from 
Citrus aurantium, are both prepared from the fresh peel, and they 
cannot be differentiated by chemical means. Experts claim to be able 
to distinguish between the two oils by odor and taste. 

Uses. Oil of orange enters into the official Spiritus Aurantii Com- 
positus and Elixir Aromaticus. 

Spirit of orange, or orange extract, is orange oil dissolved in alcohol. 
The Federal 1 standard for orange extract is as follows : 

Orange Extract is the flavoring extract prepared from oil of orange or from orange 
peel, or both, and contains not less than five (5) per cent, by volume of oil of orange. 

Terpenless Extract of Orange is the flavoring extract prepared by shaking oil of 
orange with dilute alcohol, or by dissolving terpenless oil of orange in dilute alcohol, 
and corresponds in flavoring strength to orange extract. 

Notice of Judgment No. 3501: Soluble orange extract indicated 
40.3 per cent, of alcohol and 0.02 per cent, of citral. No oil present. 

Orange extract may be assayed by direct polarization in a 200 mm. 
tube at 25 C., and the reading in Ventzke degrees divided by 5.2 will 
give the percentage of oil by volume, provided no other optically 
active substance is present.

Completely soluble in 3 volumes of ether. 
Partially soluble in alcohol. 

Principal Components. The exact composition varies, but it con- 
tains cadinene (a sesquiterpene widely distributed in volatile oils), 
phenols, and probably phenol esters of resinous substances. Cadinene 
(Ci 5 H 24 ) is found, not only in oil of cade, but, also, in many oils such 
as cubeb, savin, betel nuts, camphor, cedarwood, jumper, wormwood, 
peppermint, and other oils. 

Bornyl acetate (Ci Hi 7 O.COCH 3 ) is also a constituent of oil of 
cade. 1 

Properties and Tests. Oil of cade is a dark brown, clear, thick 
liquid, having a tarry, empyreumatic odor and a warm, faintly aro- 
matic and bitter taste. U. S. P. 

Pure oil of cade is soluble in olive oil, turpentine, amyl alcohol, 
ether, benzin, chloroform, carbon bisulphide, aniline and glacial acetic 
acid. The Pharmacopoeia states that it is only partially soluble 
in alcohol and petroleum benzin. 

The constants and tests as given by De Schulz is given by Adams 2 
and also the characteristics of samples obtained from reliable French 
firms. The results of his examination of these samples will follow. 
The names at the top of the columns are those of the firms which 
supplied the oil. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia test for rosin and rosin oil is as 
follows : 

Agitate 1 cc. of oil of cade with 15 cc. of purified petroleum benzin, filter the benzin 
solution, add an equal volume of copper acetate solution (1 in 100), shake the mixture 
and then allow it to separate. On adding an equal volume of ether to the separated 
benzin solution, it produces no intensely green coloration and does not become 
colored more than light yellow to brown (rosin and rosin oil). 

Oil of cade is distinguished from pine tar oils by Pepin's test, 3 as 
follows: 

One cc. of the oil is strongly shaken with 15 cc. of petroleum ether 
and filtered; ten cc. of the filtrate is mixed with an equal volume of 
a neutral 5 per cent, solution of copper acetate. Shake and let the 
mixture stand for some time. Five cc. of the layer of petroleum ether 
are removed with a siphon, and mixed with 10 cc. of ethyl ether; 
This mixture acquires an intense green color if the cade oil is adulter-

Another test for adulteration with oils from wood or coal tar is to 
add a few drops of aniline to an aqueous nitrate of the oil. If adulter- 
ated with tar oils which contain furfurol, an immediate, bright red 
color is produced. If the oil is pure, no coloration is produced, or 
not for some time.

OLEUM CAJUPUTI. 
Oil of Cajuput. Oil of Cajeput. 

Essence de cajeput, Fr. Cajeputol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from the fresh leaves and twigs of several 
varieties of Melaleuca Leucodendron Linn6, especially the variety 
Cajeputi Roxburg and the variety minor Smith (Fam. Myrtaceae). 
U. S. P. 

The trees grow about 45 to 50 feet high and are indigenous to the 
islands of the Indian Ocean, Queensland, Australia, India and New 
South Wales. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, there were imported into the 
United States 27,775 pounds of oil of cajuput. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.912 to 0.925. 

Refractive index at 25 C 1.4711 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C. not to exceed 4 

Soluble in 1 volume of 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Cineol, per cent 55 to 60 

Principal Components. Cineol 55 to 60 per cent., cineolic acid, 
cajeputol or cajeputene. Schimmel and Company 1 obtained terpineol 
from the fraction of cajuput oil boiling between 215 and 220 C., by 
means of cooling in a refrigerating mixture of solid carbonic acid and 
ether. Terpineol crystallizes at ordinary temperature. Melting 
point 33 to 34 C. 

Preparation. The oil is distilled from the leaves by steam. 

Properties and Tests. The rectified oil is colorless, but the com- 
mercial oil has a blue-green color due to traces of copper, probably 
due to contamination from the stills or from the drums in which the 
oil is shipped. 

It will become semi-solid with one-third to one-half its volume of 
phosphoric acid (specific gravity 1.75), which indicates a due propor- 
tion of cineol, that is, not less than 55 per cent. The assay method 
for the determination of cineol has been omitted from the last edition 
of the U. S. P., but the method of the Eighth Revision is as follows: 

Assay for Cineol. Introduce into a beaker, a solution prepared by dissolving 10 
cc. of oil of cajuput in 50 cc. of purified petroleum benzin; immerse the beaker in a 
freezing mixture and add phosphoric acid, drop by drop, with constant stirring, until 
the white magma of cineol phosphate formed begins to assume a yellowish or pinkish

tint; then transfer the magma to a force filter, wash it with cold purified petroleum 
benzin, and dry by pressure between two porous plates. Transfer the precipitate 
(cineol phosphate) to a narrow graduated cylinder and add warm water, which will 
cause the separation of the cineol. The volume, in cc., of separated oily liquid, 
multiplied by 10, represents the volume per cent, of cineol.

Number 4536, on distillation, gave 9 per cent, under 170 C. and 
62 per cent, from 170 to 190 C. Allen states that cajuput oil of 
good quality should give 60 per cent, of distillate between 175 and 
185 C. 

When oil of cajuput is adulterated with turpentine the specific 
gravity is lowered. The abstraction of cineol would also lower the 
specific gravity. Oil of eucalyptus containing a large percentage of 
cineol is often partially if not almost wholly substituted for oil of 
cajuput. The bulk of cajuput oil produced is consumed in the United 
States. 

Uses. Stimulant and anti-spasmodic.

enous to Northern and Central Europe. Cultivated in England, 
Germany, Holland, Prussia, Norway and Sweden.

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.900 to 0.910. 

Refractive index at 25 C. (B.P.) 1.485 to 1.479. 

Refractive index at 20 C. (author) 1.4884 to 1.4891. 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C., between +70 and +80. 

Soluble in 8 volumes 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Carvone and the terpene d-limonene. 

Preparation. It is obtained by steam distillation of the crushed 
fruit and the yield from the seed varies from 3.2 to 7 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of caraway is a colorless or pale yellow 
liquid, having the characteristic odor and taste of caraway. 

The oil should yield not less than 50 per cent., by volume, of carvone 
when assayed by the U. S. P. method as follows: 

Introduce 10 cc. of the oil into a 200 cc. flask with a long graduated neck (cassia 
flask) by means of a pipette, add 50 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium sulphite, 
which has been carefully rendered neutral to phenolphthalein 
T.S. by means of acetic acid; heat the mixture in a bath con- A 

taining boiling water and shake the flask repeatedly, neu- 
tralizing the mixture from time to time by the addition of a 
few drops of diluted acetic acid. When no coloration appears 
upon the addition of a few more drops of phenolphthalein 
T.S. and heating for fifteen minutes, cool, and when the 
liquids have separated completely, add sufficient of the 
sodium sulphite solution to raise the lower limit of the oily 
layer within the graduated portion of the neck and note the 
volume of the residual liquid. This measures not more than 
5 cc., indicating the presence of not less than 50 per cent, by 
volume, of carvone. 

The value of the oil of caraway may also be esti- 
mated by fractional distillation. The pure oil will 
yield the d-limonene, which should not exceed 25 
per cent., at a temperature of from 170 to 180 C., 
and the carvone would be in the fraction between 
220 and 230 C. and be not less than 50 per cent. 
Allen states that at least 40 per cent, of oil of car- 
away should distil at not above 200 C. He also 
gives a method of detecting carvone as follows: 
Heat equal amounts of the oil and phenylhydrazine for a few min- 
utes at 100 C. On cooling the mixture, a mass of light yellow crystals 
of hydrozone (Ci Hi 4 : N.NHC 6 H 5 ) will be produced. 

Carvone exists as a natural constituent in oil of caraway and only 
one other official oil, that is, spearmint. 

Five methods for the determination of carvone are enumerated by 
Kremers and Schreiner 1 as follows: 

1 Pharm. Rev., 1896, 14, 76. 




FIG. 18. 
Cassia Flask. 



322 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

I. By fractional distillation. 
II. By means of the crystalline hydrogen sulphide addition product. 

III. By HubPs iodine absorption method. 

IV. By means of specific gravity. 
V. By means of phenylhydrazine. 

After criticising all the above methods, they describe a method for 
the determination of carvone as carvoxime and give their results 
of analyses of both caraway and spearmint oils. This method has not 
been adopted by the United States Pharmacopoeia and the original 
paper should be consulted for details. 

When carvone is removed from oil of caraway the resulting oil is 
nearly pure d-limonene (carvene) and is sold as " light " oil of cara- 
way. The lowering of the specific gravity would indicate the removal 
of part or all of the carvone. Caraway chaff oil is an oil distilled from 
the herb and the chaff obtained on threshing the seeds. 

Henderson 1 records finding castor oil as an adulterant in caraway 
oil. The oil on fractional distillation yielded the following: 

From 170 to 180 C 32% Optical rotation at 9 C. . . +98

Uses. Oil of caraway is used in the official compound spirits of 
juniper. It is a stimulant and carminative. Often the oil is distilled 
from the whole seeds. The exhausted seeds are dried and sold to 
cheese manufacturers, and also as cattle feed. 

Carvone. Carvone, or carvol (CioHuO), is official in the British 
Pharmaceutical Codex and the methods of preparation are as follows: 
(a) By fractional distillation, (b) An alcoholic solution of the oil 
is saturated with ammonia gas, and then treated with hydrogen 
sulphide gas, when crystals of an additional compound (CioHi 4 OH 2 S) 
are formed, which are purified by recrystallization from methyl 
alcohol and subsequently decomposed by alcoholic potash. It is a 
thickish, colorless, or slightly yellow liquid, with a characteristic 
odor of oil of caraway. Specific gravity 0.963; boiling point 224; 
(n)^ in a 100 mm. tube = +62. Pure carvone solidifies at low tem- 
peratures. A solution in alcohol gives a violet color when treated 
with a very dilute solution of ferric chloride. 

Carvone is used as an aromatic carminative.

the distillation of the oil. The yield is as high as 18 per cent, from 
the cloves. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of cloves is a colorless or pale yellow 
liquid, becoming darker and thicker by age and exposure to the air,

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



The Pharmacopoeial test for phenol is to shake 1 cc. with 20 cc. 
of hot distilled water. The solution should not show more than a 
scarcely perceptible acid reaction with litmus. After cooling and 
filtering the aqueous solution, the filtrate should yield only a transient, 
grayish-green color, but not a blue or violet color, with a drop of 
ferric chloride test solution. 

The eugenol is determined by Hurney's method, 1 as directed in the 
United States Pharmacopoeia as follows: 

Introduce 10 cc. of the oil into a flask with a long graduated neck (cassia flask), 
add 50 cc. of potassium hydroxide T.S., shak the mixture for five minutes and then 
heat it on a water bath during ten minutes; cool, and when the liquids have sepa- 
rated completely, add sufficient potassium hydroxide T.S. to raise the lower limit 
of the oily layer within the graduated portion of the neck and note the volume 
of the residual liquid. This measures not more than 1.8 cc., indicating the presence 
of not less than 82 per cent., by volume, of eugenol. 

The oily layer (unsaponifiable) is non-phenols. 

Oil of cloves has been found adulterated with 10 per cent, of castor 
oil. 2 

The analysis 3 of two commercial samples of adulterated oil of cloves 
gave the following results:

Uses. It is used as a flavoring extract, which should contain not 
less than 2 per cent, of the oil. The oil is a stimulant and carminative. 

Assay of Extract of Cloves. Transfer 10 cc. of the extract to a 
separatory funnel, add 30 per cent, of water, acidify with 1 cc. of 
hydrochloric acid (1 to 1) and extract three times with ether, using 
not less than 100 cc. altogether. Wash the combined ether solutions 
twice with water; transfer to a tared, wide-mouthed weighing bottle 
and evaporate the ether as rapidly as possible on a boiling water 
bath, rotating the liquid upon the sides of the bottle in order to rid the 
residual oil of traces of ether. Weigh the residue and divide the 
weight by the specific gravity (1.055 average) of the oil in order to 
obtain the per cent, of oil by volume. Allow the weighing bottle to 
remain in the balance case until the usual film of moisture has evap-

orated before weighing. Weighing should not be delayed over three 
minutes. 1 

Cloves. Cloves are the dried flower buds of Caryophyllus aro- 
maticus Linn6, which contain not more than five (5) per cent, of clove 
stems; not less than ten (10) per cent, volatile ether extract; not less 
than twelve (12) per cent, of quercitannic acid (calculated from the 
total oxygen absorbed by aqueous extract); not more than eight (8) 
per cent, of total ash; not more than five-tenths (0.5) per cent, of 
ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and not more than ten (10) per cent, 
crude fiber. 2 

Ground cloves are adulterated by being mixed with clove stems, 
exhausted by distilling the oil. This would lower the ether extract 
and produce a higher ash. 

Notice of Judgment No. 529 was a case where the oil had been 
abstracted and then colored; No. 4888, exhausted cloves mixed with 
allspice; No. 4778, the oil had been completely exhausted from the 
cloves. 

McGill 8 suggests the following standard for ground cloves : 

Percent. 

(a) Total ash 8 

(b) Sand, not exceeding 0.5 

(c) Moisture, not exceeding 10 

(d) Volatile oil, not less than 14 

(e) Tannic acid, not less than 12 

(f) Crude fiber, not more than 10 

As reported by McGill, on 286 samples of ground doves, a large 
proportion were adulterated with allspice which was used by the 
manufacturers when grinding cloves of high oil content. Other adul- 
terants were clove-stems, exhausted cloves, wheat and corn starch.

Preparation. Eugenol is prepared by shaking oil of cloves with an 
excess of 5 to 10 per cent, solution of sodium hydroxide, drawing off 
the resulting solution of eugenol-sodium, washing it with ether and 
decomposing by means of dilute sulphuric acid. The eugenol which 
separates is washed with a solution of sodium bicarbonate and finally 
distilled with steam or in vacuo. 

Properties and Tests. Eugenol is a colorless or pale yellow, thin 
liquid, having a strongly aromatic odor of cloves, and a pungent and 
spicy taste. U. S. P. It is soluble in all proportions in alcohol, 
ether, chloroform, glacial acetic acid and fixed oils. Soluble in twice 
its volume of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Test for phenol: shake 1 cc. with 20 cc. of distilled water and 
filter. Add 1 cc. ferric chloride solution to 5 cc. of the aqueous 
filtrate; a blue or violet color would indicate phenol. With pure 
eugenol a transient, grayish-green color would be produced. 

Eugenol forms salts with all the alkali metals, which have the general 
properties of phenolates. 2 

Uses. Eugenol is used as an antiseptic, especially in dental prac- 
tice, and for making vanillin. 

Vanillin. Methylprotocatechuic aldehyde (C 6 H 3 .OH.OCH 3 .COH 
= 152.06.) Vanillic aldehyde. Aldehyde vanillique, Fr. Proto-

Vanillin, or methyl-protocatechuic aldehyde (C 6 H 3 OH.OCH 3 COH) 
exists in vanilla beans to the extent of 2 per cent., and in various 
amounts in Siam benzoin, balsam of Peru and tolu. It is produced 
synthetically from eugenol by oxidation with potassium permanganate.

VOLATILE ORTESSENTIAL OILS. 327 

According to a French patent, number 316,526, March 26, 1902, 
vanillin is produced by passing a rapid current of air through spirit 
of turpentine and then over asbestos cloth soaked in eugenol, which 
becomes oxidized to vanillin. 

Vanillin occurs in fine, white, or only very slightly yellowish, 
crystalline needles, having the odor and taste of vanilla. U. S. P. 
It is soluble in ether, alcohol, chloroform, glycerin, and to a limited 
extent in fixed oils. Melting point 80 C. to 82 C. 

Acetanilid is used as an adulterant for vanillin and is detected by 
the following test : A small quantity of the substance is warmed with 
a concentrated alcoholic solution of sodium hydroxide, a drop of 
chloroform added, and again warmed. The characteristic odor of 
phenylisocyanide will be perceptible if acetanilid is present. 

Uses. Vanillin is used in flavoring extracts and in many cases in 
preparation of artificial vanilla extracts.

U. S. P. 

Oil of Cassia of the Eighth and Ninth Revisions of the United 
States Pharmacopoeia are from the same source, but in the Eighth 
Revision it was called oil of cinnamon and the requirement for cinnamic 
aldehyde was 75 per cent. The Federal Standards define oil of cassia 
as being the oil of cinnamomum cassia Bl., and contains not less than 
75 per cent, of cinnamic aldehyde; and the oil of cinnamon as being 
a volatile oil obtained from the bark of the Ceylon cinnamomum 
(Cinnamomum zeylanicum Breyne), and containing not less than sixty- 
five (65) per cent., by weight, of cinnamic aldehyde, and not more than 
ten (10) per cent., by weight, of eugenol. China, or Canton, cinnamon 
is obtained from a small evergreen tree growing in Southeastern China. 
Saigon Cassia, a high grade bark, is obtained from a tree grown in 
Cochin-China. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, there were imported into the 
United States 174,855 pounds of oil of cassia and cinnamon.

Principal Components. Cinnamic aldehyde, cinnamyl acetate, 
phenyl propyl acetate, methyl orthocumaric aldehyde. In 1915 Dodge 
and Sherndal l announced they had also found salicylic aldehyde, 
0.1 to 0.2 per cent., coumarin, benzoic acid, salicylic acid and a liquid 
acid of fruity odor. In 1918, Dodge 2 found two additional com- 
ponents benzaldehyde and methyl salicylaldehyde. 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by both steam and direct 
distillation of the bark and leaves. The better grade of oil is made by 
steam distillation, only. The yield of oil is from 0.93 to 4.0 per cent., 
depending upon the species of cassia used. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of cinnamon is a yellowish or brownish 
liquid, becoming darker and thicker by age and exposure to the air, 
and having a characteristic odor and taste of cinnamon. U. S. P. 

Oil of cassia is adulterated with lead, which is probably due to lead 
containers in which it is shipped. 

Test for Lead. A few drops of the oil are saturated with hydrogen 
sulphide when a dark precipitate or coloration is produced in case lead 
is present. 

Rosin or colophony added to oil of cinnamon appears to be a 
favorite adulterant. The United States Pharmacopoeia test for rosin

is to shake 2 cc. of the oil in 5 or 10 cc. of petroleum benzin and decant 
the latter; the liquid is colorless and does not assume a green color 
when treated with an equal volume of (1 to 1000) copper acetate 
solution. Schimmel & Company l dissolve the oil in three parts of 
70 per cent, alcohol with a saturated solution of lead acetate in alcohol 
of similar strength. A precipitate is formed in case rosin is present; 
whereas, no precipitate occurs in the absence of rosin. 

Distillation Test. A residue in excess of 10 per cent., and generally 
6 to 8 per cent., would indicate rosin. Apply the test as follows: 

"Fifty grams of cassia oil are weighed in a tared fractionation flask of 100 cc. 
capacity. A tube 1 M. in length is attached as condenser and the oil distilled with 
the aid of a direct flame. At first water passes over with 'cracking.' The ther- 
mometer then rises rapidly to 240 and the bulk of the oil distils between 240 and 
260. The end of the distillation is indicated by the appearance of white fumes 
arising from the decomposition of the residue. The thermometer at the same time 
rises to 280 to 290. Upon cooling, the residue in the flask is weighed. The 
residue of a good oil is viscid and tough and constitutes 6 to 8 (at most 10) 
per cent, of the oil. The residue of an oil adulterated with rosin is hard and brittle 
and correspondingly larger. 

"Instead of weighing the oil, 50 cc. can be measured in a pipette and the dis- 
tillate be collected in a graduated cylinder. By deducting the number of cc. of 
distillate from 50, the amount of residue can be ascertained with sufficient accuracy." 2 

In oil of cassia adulterated with colophony, the acid value is higher. 

The acid value, as stated by Schimmel and Company, 3 cannot be 
relied upon in the quantitative determination of added rosin because 
the oils themselves contain varying quantities of cinnamic acid. The 
acid values, therefore, do not permit of any direct conclusions con- 
cerning the quantities of rosin present in the oil. 

The Pharmacopoeial test for cinnamic aldehyde is as follows : 

Cinnamic Aldehyde is determined by the sodium sulphite method 
as is given in the United States Pharmacopoeia VIII, as follows : 

Introduce into a measuring flask with a long graduated neck (cassia flask), by 
means of a measuring pipette, 10 cc. of the Oil of Cinnamon, add 10 cc. of a 30 per 
cent, solution of sodium bisulphite, shake the flask, and heat it in a water-bath 
containing boiling water until the contents are liquefied; add successive portions 
(10 cc. each) of the bisulphite solution, shaking and heating as before, after each 
addition, until the flask is three-fourths filled. Continue to heat it in the water 
bath until the odor of cinnamic aldehyde is no longer perceptible, cool the flask to 
about 25 C. (77 F.), and add enough of the bisulphite solution to raise the lower 
limit of the oily layer to the zero mark of the scale. The residual liquid should not 
measure more than 2.5 cc., corresponding to at least 75 per cent., by volume, of 
cinnamic aldehyde.

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 331 

In the British Pharmacopoeia the oil of cinnamomum zeylanicum 
is official and the cinnamomum cassia oil is not recognized. This oil 
is sold under the commercial name of Ceylon cinnamon oil and the 
constants as given by the British Pharmacopoeia are as follows : 

Specific gravity at 25 C. 1.000 to 1.030 

Refractive index at 25 C 1.565 to 1.580 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C 0.5 to 1.0 

Soluble in 3 to 4 parts of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Cinnamic aldehyde, per cent 55 to 60 

Ceylon cinnamon oil contains from 60 to 80 per cent, cinnamic 
aldehyde, and generally 4 to 8 per cent, of eugenol. It is often 
adulterated with cinnamon leaf oil which contains a larger proportion 
of eugenol and very little cinnamic aldehyde. This adulterant would 
lower the percentage of cinnamic aldehyde and increase the percentage 
of eugenol. 

Uses. The oil is used in the preparation of Aqua Cinnamomi and 
Spiritus Cinnamomi. U. S. P. 

Spiritus Cinnamomi. U. S. P. contains 10 per cent, of the oil. The 
flavoring extract of cinnamon is made with 2 per cent, of the oil, by 
volume. The extract is assayed by the same method given for extract 
of clove. 

Cinnamon (Ground or Powdered). Ground cinnamon, ground 
cassia, is a powder consisting of cinnamon, cassia, or cassia buds, or a 
mixture of these spices, and contains not more than six (6) per cent, 
of total ash and not more than two (2) per cent, of sand. 1 

Ground walnut shells are used for adulterating powdered cinnamon, 
as well as a number of other substances such as olive stones, pea hulls, 
tumeric and other spices pepper, ginger and mustard. Most of 
these adulterants would be detected microscopically. 

Saigon cinnamon and Ceylon cinnamon are both official in the 
United States Pharmacopoeia. The standard for ash in both cases 
is the same, that is, six (6) per cent., with not more than two (2) per 
cent, of the ash insoluble in diluted hydrochloric acid. Saigon cin- 
namon should yield not less than 2 per cent, of volatile ether extract, 
while the Ceylon cinnamon should yield not less than 0.5 per cent, of 
volatile ether extract. The volatile ether extract is determined by 
subjecting 2 grams of the powdered cinnamon for twenty-four hours 
to the action of dehydrated ether in a continuous extracting apparatus. 
Allow the ether to evaporate spontaneously at room temperature and 
dry in desiccator over sulphuric acid during eighteen hours and weigh. 
Heat the extract gradually to 110 C. to constant weight, cool and 
weigh. The loss in weight will be the volatile ether extract.

Principal Component is ascaridol (CioHi 6 O 2 ). This was obtained 
by Schimmel & Co. 1 by fractionating the oil under reduced pressure. 
The oil has the property of decomposing with explosion when distilled 
at atmospheric pressure. 

Preparation and Yield. For high grade oil the crushed seeds only 
should be distilled, and the cooling should be slight so that the dis- 
tillate runs off hot. The distillation should not be vigorous, in order 
to allow time for the distillate to separate off from the water in the 
receiver. (Schimmel & Co.). The yield from the crushed seed and 
herb is from 0.48 to 0.63 per cent., and from the crushed seed alone, 
0.78 to 1.03 per cent. 

"Wermolin" 2 is put up in vials containing 50 grams of the sub- 
stance which consists of 1.5 grams of American wormseed oil in 
castor oil, together with saccharin and essential oils, which are added 
to correct the taste. 

Properties and Tests for Purity. Oil of chenopodium is a colorless 
or pale yellowish liquid, having a characteristic, disagreeable odor 
and taste. U. S. P. 

Oil of turpentine would be the probable adulterant and it would 
lower the speicfic gravity. 

Uses. It is used as an anthelmintic.

OLEUM EUCALYPTI. 

Oil of Eucalyptus. 

Essence d'eucalyptus, Fr. Eucalyptusol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from fresh leaves of Eucalyptus Globulus 
Labillardiere (Fam. Myrtaceae) or from some other species of Eucalyp- 
tus, and yielding not less than 70 per cent, of eucaluptol (cineol) 
(CioHisO = 154.14). U. S. P. Eucalyptus is indigenous to Australia 
and is cultivated in many countries Portugal, Mexico and India. 
It is grown in California and Florida and other places in the United 
States. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, there were imported into the 
United States 291,492 pounds of oil of eucalyptus. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.905 to 0.925 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4623 to 1.4624 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 20 C. (B.P.) . -10 to +10 
Soluble in 4 volumes of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Eucalyptol (cineol), not less than 70 per 
cent., pinene and other terpenes. The official eucalyptus oil should 
be free from phellandrene which occurs in the oil from certain species 
of eucalyptus. 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by steam distillation of the 
leaves. The yield is from 3 to 6 per cent. Tompkins 1 found the 
yield from one-year-old foliage to be 0.09, two-year-old 0.21, and 
three-year-old 0.84 per cent, of oil. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of eucalyptus is a colorless, or pale 
yellow liquid, having a characteristic, aromatic, somewhat camphora- 
ceous odor, and a pungent, spicy, and cooling taste. U. S. P. 

Smith 2 has reported upon the refractive index, specific gravity and 
optical rotation of a number of eucalyptus oils, produced from different 
species of eucalyptus, as follows : 

OIL OF EUCALYPTUS POLYBRACTEA. 

Specific gravity at 15 C 0.9195 to 0.9300 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4586 to 1.4624 

a D (temperature not stated) -0.2 to +0.5 

He states that the optical rotation of above oil is generally d- 
rotatory, although it occasionally shows 1-rotatory, which is due to 
optically active, aromatic, aldehyde aromadendral and not to phel-

landrene. The oil from this species is richest in cineol content, which 
is indicated by the low refractive index. 

OIL OF EUCALYPTUS AUSTRALIANA OF NEW SOUTH WALES. 

First-Hour Oil. 

Specific gravity at 15 C 0.9186 to 0.9220 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4617 to 1.4636 

ao (temperature not stated) 1.2 to +1.7 

Second-Hour Oil. 

Specific gravity at 15 C 0.9096 to 0.9160 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4710 to 1.4711 

a D (temperature not stated) +2.0 to +3.6 

In oil from this species of eucalyptus, a d-rotation is due to the 
phellandrene present. The amount of cineol in the second-hour oil 
does not usually exceed a fourth the amount present in the first- 
hour oil. 

OIL OF EUCALYPTUS DIVES, NEW SOUTH WALES. 

Specific gravity at 15 C 0.8892 to 0.9020 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4798 to 1.4811 

an (temperature not stated) 55.4 to 69.8 

This oil usually contains less than 5 per cent, cineol and is the 
best oil of all the essential oils for mineral separation by flotation. 
It appears that eucalyptus oil is used in metallurgy in Australia, and 
is added to refractory ores when ground with water to assist in bringing 
mineral particles to the surface. 

The Pharmacopoeial test for the presence of large amounts of 
phellandrene in oil of eucalyptus is made by adding a saturated 
solution of sodium nitrite to the oil mixed with an equal volume of 
glacial acetic acid. If any considerable amount of phellandrene is 
present, white crystals of phellandrene nitrite will be formed upon 
stirring the mixture. 

A number of methods have been proposed for the determination of 
eucalyptol. Kebler 1 precipitated the eucalyptol by phosphoric acid 
and finally decomposed the eucalyptol phosphate and determined 
the amount of liberated phosphoric acid, obtaining the eucalyptol by 
difference. 

The method is as follows: Eight grams of the oil are weighed out 
in a suitable beaker, cooled in ice water, 4 cc. of phosphoric acid 
(1.75) added and again placed in ice water. After cooling, the con- 
tents of the beaker are slowly and thoroughly mixed by means of a 
glass rod, and eucalyptol phosphate removed, purified by pressure, 

1 Pro. A. Ph. A., 1898, 46, 410-411. 



338 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

weighed, decomposed with hot water, and the acid estimated by means 
of a standard alkaline solution. The eucalyptol is obtained by 
difference. 

In the United States Pharmacopoeia VIII, the liberated cineol is 
estimated by volume. The details are given as follows: 

Introduce into a beaker a solution prepared by dissolving 10 cc. of the oil of 
eucalyptus in 50 cc. purified petroleum benzin; immerse the beaker in a freezing 
mixture and add phosphoric acid, drop by drop, with constant stirring, until a white 
magma of cineol phosphate formed begins to assume a yellowish or pinkish tint; 
then transfer the magma to a force filter, wash it with cold, purified benzin, and dry 
by pressure between two porous plates. Transfer the precipitate (cineol phosphate) 
to a narrow graduated cylinder, and add warm water, which will cause separation of 
cineol. The volume, in cubic centimeters, of separated oil, multiplied by 10, repre- 
sents the volume per cent, of cineol (eucalyptol). 

The determination of cineol by the resorcinol method as proposed 
by Schimmel & Co. 1 is as follows: 10 cc. of the oil are mixed in a cassia 
flask of 100 cc. capacity, with enough 50 per cent, resorcinol solution 
to fill the flask about four-fifths full. Shake thoroughly for about 
five minutes, and the oil-portions which have not entered into the 
reaction are brought into the neck of the flask by adding resorcinol 
solution, and their volume determined. By subtracting their volume 
from 10 the cineol content of the oil is obtained, which is expressed in 
volume by multiplying by 10. 

Oils rich in cineol should be diluted with an equal volume of turpen- 
tine to prevent solidification by crystallization of the cineol resorcinol. 
Correction should be made for the dilution in calculating the per- 
centage. 

The resorcinol solution must be full 50 per cent, strength as the 
separation does not take place with solutions of less concentration. 

Numerous methods for the determination of cineol have been pro- 
posed, but many are of only historical interest and only one more 
will be included, that is, the one official in the United States Pharma- 
copoeia IX: 

Measure 10 cc. of the oil, from a pipette, into a round bottom glass dish of 50 cc. 
capacity, which is imbedded in finely broken ice. Add 10 cc. of arsenic acid T.S. 
and stir until precipitation is complete. When the mixture ceases to congeal further, 
allow it to stand for ten minutes in the ice bath. (If at this point a hard mass is 
formed, add 5 cc. of purified petroleum benzin, and mix the mass well before pro- 
ceeding with the assay.) Then transfer immediately to a hardened filter paper, 
about 18.5 cm. in diameter, by means of a pliable horn spatula; spread it evenly 
over the surface of the paper and lay a second hardened filter paper over the top. 
Wrap several thicknesses of absorbent or filter paper around the hardened filters, 
and place the whole between the plates of a press and bring to bear all the pressure 

1 Semi-Annual Rep., 1906, Oct. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 339 

possible for about one minute. Change the outside absorbent papers and press 
again, repeating the operation, if necessary, until the eucalyptol arsenate is appar- 
ently dry, and separates readily when touched with a spatula. The pressing is not 
complete when a hard mass remains which is broken up with difficulty; and usually 
two changes of filter paper are required, pressing each time for about two minutes. 
If left too long in the press the compound may decompose. Now, transfer the com- 
pound completely by means of a horn spatula to a glass funnel inserted into a 100 cc. 
cassia flask with a neck graduated to 10 cc. into tenths. Wash the last portions of 
the precipitate into the flask with a stream of hot distilled water from a wash bottle, 
assisting the disintegration with a glass rod, place the flask in boiling water and 
rotate it until the compound is thoroughly broken up. Then add enough distilled 
water to cause the eucalyptol to rise into the neck of the flask, cool it to room tem- 
perature and read its volume. This volume, multiplied by 10, shows the percentage 
of eucalyptol (cineol) in the oil. 

Uses. It is used to a very large extent as a prophylactic against' 
influenza. It is also used in metallurgy as heretofore indicated.

Preparation. Schimmel l process of preparing eucalyptol consists 
of mixing oil of eucalyptol with slightly more than the necessary 
quantity of phosphoric acid of a specific gravity of 1.8, with constant 
stirring, care being taken to cool the mixture. The eucalyptol phos- 
phate which crystallizes out is then purified by pressing and afterwards 
decomposed by means of water. 

Properties and Tests. Eucalyptol is a colorless liquid, having 
a characteristic, aromatic and distinctly camphoraceous odor, and a 
pungent, spicy taste; it produces a cooling sensation in the mouth. 
U. S. P. Miscible with alcohol, chloroform, ether, glacial acetic acid,

As eucalyptol is unsaponifiable, the addition of fixed oils as adul- 
terants would be detected when treated with an alkali. 

Phenols would be indicated if to an alcoholic solution of eucalyptol 
a drop of ferric chloride added produces a violet color.

Soluble in 8 volumes of 80 per cent, alcohol and in 1 vol- 
ume 90 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Anethol, 50 to 60 per cent.; fenchone 
(which is isomeric and closely related to camphor); d-pinene, anisic 
aldehyde, anisic acid and small amounts of less common substances. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 341 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by steam distillation of 
the crushed fruit. The yield varies from 4 to 6 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Owing to the presence of anethol, unadul- 
terated oil of fennel should have a congealing point not below + 3 C. 
A test tube containing 10 cc. of the oil is cooled in a freezing mixture 
until the temperature has fallen to C. The inside of the test tube 
is rubbed with the thermometer to induce crystallization, the tube 
having been removed from the freezing mixture during crystallization. 
The highest temperature obtained during the crystallization is con- 
sidered the congealing point. 

In case of adulteration with alcohol or turpentine the specific 
gravity would be lowered. 

Two samples of oil of fennel reported upon by the United States 
Department of Agriculture were as follows : 

No. 2748. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.9318 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4978 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 20 C +31.3 

Congealing below -10.0 C. 

Insoluble in 10 to 20 volumes of 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Slightly acid to litmus. 

Considerable part of the anethol had been removed. 

No. 3558. 

Does not congeal at 9 C. 

Insoluble in 10 volumes of 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Low in anethol. 

Congealing point lower than required by the U. S. P. 

Uses. Oil of fennel enters into three pharmacopoeial preparations; 
fennel water, compound licorice powder, and compound spirits of 
juniper. 

By-Products. The distillation residue is valuable as a stock food 
as it contains, after drying, 14 to 22 per cent, of protein and 12 to 18 
per cent, of fat. 

Fennel Seed or powdered fennel should yield not to exceed 9 
per cent, of ash. The powdered seeds are often adulterated by the 
addition of foreign seeds, the addition of mineral matter, and by 
exhausting the seeds with solvents. The exhausted seed may be 
detected by shaking 3 to 5 grams with 95 per cent, alcohol and allowing 
to stand for a few minutes. If the seeds are genuine they retain their 
original color, but if exhausted they become dark or black. Another 
simple test is to mix the seeds with water. Pure seeds will float, 
owing to their high percentage of fat, but the exhausted seeds will 
become dark and settle to the bottom. Fennel seeds have been 
found colored with chrome yellow and ochre.

The standard for ester value, official in the British Pharmacopoeia, 
is from 7 to 11 per cent, for the English oil, and not less than 30 per 
cent, for all foreign oils, calculated as linalyl acetate (Ci2Hi7C2H302). 

The regular test for alcohol in essential oils should be applied, 
that is, to shake an equal volume of the oil with water; if the volume 
diminishes, alcohol should be suspected. 

Schimmel & Co. report one sample of lavender oil as being adul- 
terated with benzoic acid. Weber l reports detecting about 1 per cent, 
of salicylic acid in lavender oil. These were evidently added to 
increase the ester value. 

Foreign esters are detected as follows: Shake 20 cc. of the oil with 
40 cc. of 5 per cent, alcohol and, when the mixture has cleared, with- 
draw 30 cc. of the alcoholic solution. Neutralize this with half- 
normal potassium hydroxide V.S., using phenolphthalein T.S. as 
indicator; then add 5 cc. half-normal potassium hydroxide V.S. and 
heat the mixture on a water bath, under a reflux condenser, during 
one hour. Not less than 4.7 cc. of half-normal hydrochloric acid 
V.S. is required for neutralization. U. S. P. 

Hall and Harvey 2 propose the following method for the determina- 
tion of glyceryl acetate in oil of lavender: 

Ten grams of the oil are mixed with 50 cc. of alcohol and saponified with half- 
normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide; digest on a hot water bath about one hour 
and neutralize with half -normal hydrochloric acid. Remove the alcohol by evaporat- 
ing to dryness on a water bath. Add 20 cc. of water and extract the oily portion 
with ether, and then wash the etherial portions with about 10 cc. of water. The 
aqueous portions are then evaporated to dryness or to a syrupy consistence. The

residue will contain the glycerol originally present, which is estimated as follows: 
Add 3 grams of anhydrous sodium acetate and 8 mils of acetic anhydride to the 
residue and reflux at a gentle heat; heat for one hour; cool and add 50 cc. distilled 
water. Heat to 80 C. and again cool; filter and wash into a 500 cc. Erlenmeyer 
flask; neutralize with normal sodium hydroxide; add 25 cc. N/2 sodium hydroxide 
and reflux for 15 minutes; cool and titrate with N/2 hydrochloric acid. The con- 
sumption of N/2 sodium hydroxide measures the quantity of glycerol present and 
consequently the glycerol acetate, using the following factors: 1 cc. half -normal 
sodium hydroxide = 0.01535 glycerol = 0.03641 glyceryl acetate. It is advisable 
to always run a blank test at the same time using the sodium acetate and 5 cc. of 
N/2 sodium hydroxide. 

Oil of Spike. Oil of spike, or oil of spike lavender, is used to 
adulterate oil of lavender as well as in the preparation of liniments 
for veterinary use. 

The constants of oil of spike are as follows : 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.905 to 0.918 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 20 C -3 to +7.1 

Soluble in 3 volumes of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components of oil of spike arelinalool, 30 to 40 per cent.; 
cineol, d-pinene, d-camphene, camphor, borneol, terpineol, geraniol 
and traces of alcohols and esters.

OLEUM LIMONIS. 
Oil of Lemon. 

Essence de citron, Fr. Citronenol, G. 

A volatile oil obtained by expression from the fresh peel of the ripe 
fruit of Citrus medico, Limonum (Risso) Hooker filius (Fam. Rutaceae) 
and yielding not less than 4 per cent, of aldehydes from oil of lemon, 
calculated as citral (CioHieO = 152.13). U. S. P. 

Lemon oil is produced mostly in Sicily and France. 

The importations of lemon oil into the United States for the years 
ending June 30, 1918, 1919 and 1920, were as follows: 

1918 577,600 pounds. 

1919. 345,799 pounds.

Refractive index (Author) 1.4760 to 1.4779 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C. varies 

from +57 to +64 

Citral, not less than ' 4 per cent. 

Principal Components. Lemon oil consists of d-limonene, about 
90 per cent. ; citral 4 to 6 per cent. ; phellandrene, citronellol, geranyl 
acetate, pinene, camphene, linalyl acetate and terpinol. 

Preparation and Yield. The oil is prepared by expression of the 
fresh peel of the ripe fruit. Chace l states that 99 per cent, of the 
lemon oil manufactured in Sicily is prepared by the sponge method, 
that is, the lemons are cut in halves and the pulp removed. The 
lemon skin is inserted into a cup shaped sponge and the oil pressed 
out by hand. It takes from 1600 to 2200 halves to produce one pound 
of lemon oil. By the machine method, the lemon skins are grated and 
pressed under hand presses. The pressed oil, being of a deep, rich, 
yellowish color, is used solely for the purpose of bringing up the color 
of the pale oils. 

Properties and Tests. The Federal 2 standard for oil of lemon is : 
A volatile oil obtained from lemon peel by expression or alcoholic 
solution, with an optical rotation of not less than + 64 at 25 C. in 
a 100 mm. tube. 

Schimmel & Co. 3 state that the change in rotatory power caused by 
fluctuations of temperature, which are sometimes observed in the 
laboratory under ordinary conditions, are so slight in comparison with 
those to which the oils are subject in consequence of variation in the 
growth of the fruit, in the distillation, etc., that they may generally 
be left out of account. In the case of a few oils, such as lemon and 
orange, the range within which the power of rotation moves is in itself 
so narrow, that considerations of temperature should on no account 
be neglected, especially because even slight changes in temperature 
exercise a relatively strong influence upon precisely these two oils. 

Lemon oil should contain not less than 4 per cent, of citral. 

Terpeneless oil of lemon is oil of lemon from which all or nearly all 
the terpenes have been removed. 

Oil of lemon is a pale yellow or greenish-yellow liquid, having the 
characteristic odor and taste of lemon. U. S. P. 

The U. S. P. tests are as follows : The angle of rotation of the first 
10 per cent, of the distillate, obtained as directed under Oleum 
Aurantii, is not more than 5 degrees less than that of the original oil. 
The refractive index of this first 10 per cent, of distillate is not less 
than 0.0027 lower than that of the original oil.

Assay: Introduce about 15 cc. of oil of lemon into a tared, 300 cc. flask and 
note the exact weight; add 10 cc. of an alcoholic solution of phenylhydrazine (1 in 
10), (not darker in color than pale yellow), and allow it to stand for one-half hour 
at room temperature. Then add a few drops of methyl orange T.S. and neutralize 
the liquid exactly by the cautious addition of half-normal hydrochloric acid V.S. 
If difficulty is experienced in detecting the end point of the reaction, continue the 
titration until the solution is distinctly acid, transfer it to a separatory funnel and 
draw off the alcoholic portion. Now wash the oil with distilled water, adding the 
washings to the alcoholic solution, and titrate the latter with half-normal potassium 
hydroxide V.S. Carry out a blank test identical with the foregoing, except that the 
oil of lemon is omitted, and note the amount of half -normal hydrochloric acid V.S. 
consumed. Subtract the number of cc. of half-normal potassium hydroxide V.S. 
from the number of cc. of half-normal hydrochloric acid V.S. consumed in the 
original test, and this result from the corresponding number of cc. required in 
the blank test; each cc. of this difference corresponds to 0.076 gram of aldehydes, 
calculated as citral. It shows, when calculated from the weight of oil taken, not less 
than 4 per cent, of aldehydes from oil of lemon, calculated as citral. 

The determination of citral by the United States Pharmacopoeia 
VIII Method, which is practically the method proposed by Sadtler, 1 
is as follows : 

Introduce into a counterpoised 150 cc. flask, by means of a pipette, about 15 cc. 
of oil of lemon and note the exact weight; add 5 cc. of distilled water and a few drops 
of phenolphthalein T.S., and then neutralize the liquid exactly by the cautious 
addition of tenth-normal sodium hydroxide V.S. Add 25 cc. of a neutral solution 
of sodium sulphite (1 in 5), and immerse the flask in a water bath containing boiling 
water. From a burette, add as needed, just sufficient half -normal hydrochloric 
acid V.S. to maintain the neutrality of the mixture, keeping the flask continuously 
heated and frequently agitated, and adding a drop or two of phenolphthalein T.S. 
When a permanent condition of neutrality is reached, note the number of cubic 
centimeters of the half-normal hydrochloric acid V.S. consumed. 

Carry out a blank test, identical with the foregoing, except that the oil of lemon 
is omitted, and note the amount of half-normal hydrochloric acid V.S. consumed. 
Subtract the number of cubic centimeters required in the blank test from the number 
required in the original test. Each cubic centimeter of this difference corresponds 
to 0.03802 gram of citral. To find the percentage, multiply the above difference by 
0.03802, and this product by 100, and divide by the weight of the oil of lemon taken. 

Oil of lemon is commonly adulterated with oil of turpentine, which 
can be detected by polarization. Other adulterants, such as alcohol 
and mineral oils, would be detected in the usual manner. 

Schimmel & Co. 2 report on 15 samples of lemon oil which were 
adulterated. Their report follows.

Uses. Lemon oil is used in large quantities in the manufacture of 
flavoring extracts. The extracts are prepared by simply dissolving 
the oil in alcohol, and most manufacturers add a small amount of 
yellow coloring matter. A non-alcoholic flavoring extract of lemon 
and all other extracts prepared with volatile oils may be made by

adding the required amount of volatile oil to a fixed vegetable or 
animal oil. The standard lemon extract should contain 5 per cent, of 
lemon oil. The amount of oil is determined by direct polarization in 
a 200 mm. tube. Divide the reading in degrees Ventzke by 3.2; the 
result will give the percentage of oil by volume, provided no other 
optically active substance is present. .

Oil of Peppermint. 

Essence de Menthe Poivree, Fr. Pfefferminzol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from the flowering plant of Mentha Piperita 
Linn (Fam. Labiatae), rectified by steam distillation, and yielding 
not less than 5 per cent, of esters, calculated as menthyl acetate 
(CioHi 9 C 2 H 3 02 = 198.18), and not less than 50 per cent, total menthol 
(CioH 19 OH = 156.16), free and as esters. U. S. P. 

Peppermint is grown in many countries England, Germany, Japan, 
Russia, Italy and America (especially in New York, Michigan and 
Indiana, which had under cultivation in 1914 about 20,000 acres.). 



352 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

In 1914 the United States produced 363,991 pounds of oil of pepper- 
mint. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, the United States exported 
90,255 pounds and imported during the same period 148,227 pounds of 
peppermint oil. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.896 to 0.908 

Refractive index at 20 C. (Author) 1.4636 to 1.4643 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C 23 to 33 

Soluble in 4 volumes 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Menthol 40 to 45 per cent., esters 8 to 14 
per cent., menthone, and a great number of chemical compounds in 
minute quantities. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of peppermint is steam distilled from 
either the fresh or the dried herb. There is no loss of oil by drying 
and distillers prefer to use the dry substance. The yield varies, and 
is stated to be as low as 0.67 per cent, and as high as 2.0 per cent., or 
more. 

Todd 1 states that it is preferable to have distilling vats with false 
bottoms. When they are filled with the dry herb, the steam is 
conducted underneath the false bottom and passes up through the 
packed herb. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of peppermint is a colorless liquid, having 
a strong odor of peppermint, and a pungent taste, followed by a 
sensation of cold when air is drawn into the mouth. U. S. P. 

Oil of peppermint is adulterated by the ordinary adulterants, such 
as turpentine, oil of camphor and the substitution of dementholized 
oil. The assay of the oil would detect dementholized oil and the 
polarization would be changed on the addition of the other oils. 
Stevens 2 gives a color test for the presence of camphor oil in oil of 
peppermint: To about 1 cc. of the oil, add 1 drop of nitric acid (sp. gr. 
1.42). Let stand a few minutes. In case of pure oil of peppermint 
a yellow color only is produced. If camphor oil is present a red color 
is produced within fifteen or twenty minutes. 

The Pharmacopoeial methods of assay are as follows : 

Assay for Esters: Introduce 10 cc. of oil of peppermint into a tared flask and note 
exact weight. Add 25 cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide V.S., 
connect the flask with a reflux condenser, and boil the mixture during one hour. 
After cooling, titrate the residual alkali with half-normal sulphuric acid V.S., using 
phenolphthalein T.S. as indicator. Subtract the number of cc. of half-normal 
sulphuric acid V.S. required from the 25 cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide V.S. taken; multiply the difference by 9.909, and divide the product by 
the weight of the oil of peppermint taken, to find the percentage of menthyl acetate.

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 



353 



Assay for Total Menthol: Introduce 10 cc. of the oil into a flask provided with a 
ground-glass tube-condenser (acetylization flask), add 10 cc. of acetic anhydride and 
about 1 gram of powdered anhydrous sodium acetate, and boil the 
mixture gently during one hour. Allow it to cool, wash the acety- 
lized oil with distilled water and afterwards with sodium carbonate 
T.S. diluted with an equal volume of distilled water, until the 
mixture is slightly alkaline to phenolphthalein T.S., and then dry it 
with the aid of fused calcium chloride, and filter. Transfer 5 cc. of 
the acetylized oil to a tared 100-cc. flask, note the exact weight, add 
50 cc. of half -normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide V.S., connect the 
flask with a reflux condenser, and boil the mixture during one hour. 
After cooling, titrate the residual alkali with half-normal sulphuric 
acid V.S., using phenolphthalein T.S. as indicator, and calculate 
the percentage of menthol present, by the following formula: 



Percentage of menthol = 



A X 7.808 
B - (AX 0.021) 



hi which A is the result obtained by subtracting the number of cc. 
of half -normal sulphuric acid V.S. required in the above titration 
from the number of cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium hydrox- 
ide V.S. originally taken, and B is the weight of acetylized oil 
taken. The 0.021 is obtained by taking one-half (as half -normal 
potassium hydroxide solution is used) of 0.042, which is the con- 
stant obtained by subtracting the normal factor of menthol (0.156) 
from the normal factor of menthol acetate (0.198).

Uses. Oil of peppermint is used in preparing the official spirit of 
peppermint. The spirit of peppermint is used to disguise the taste 
of many medicines. The oil is applied externally in case of headache 
or rheumatism. 



SPIRITUS MENTHAE PIPERITAE. 
Spirit of Peppermint. Essence of Peppermint. 

The Federal Standard for this preparation to be used as a flavoring 
extract is not less than 3 per cent, of the oil and the Pharmacopoeial 
Standard is 10 per cent, of oil. Peppermint leaves are used in con- 
nection with the oil in making this preparation. The leaves impart a 
beautiful green tint to the finished product.

A volatile oil distilled from the flowering plant of Mentha spicata 
Linn6 (Mentha viridis Linne) (Fam. Labiatae), and yielding not less 
than 43 per cent., by volume, of carvone (CioHi4O = 150.11) U. S. P. 

In 1914, 5,000 acres of spearmint were cultivated in Michigan, 
Indiana and New York. The production for the year 1914 in the 
United States was 94,209 pounds of the oil. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C. 0.917 to 0.934 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4894 to 1.4940 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C -38 to -55 

Soluble in 1 volume of 80 per cent, alcohol, becom- 
ing cloudy on further dilution. 

Principal Components. Mainly 1-carvone and 1-limonene ; also, 
1-phellandrene, acetic acid, valeric acid, and 15 per cent, dihydro- 
cuminic acetate the carrier of the odorous principle of the oil. 1 

Preparation and Yield. Fritzsche Brothers 2 distilled a quantity of 
spearmint oil from the plant cultivated on their factory grounds at 
Garfield, N. J., which yielded 0.3 per cent. The oil had a specific 
gravity of 0.980 and optical rotation of - 42 20'. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of spearmint is a colorless, yellow or 
greenish liquid, having the characteristic odor and taste of spearmint. 
U. S. P. 

Carvone being the principal constituent, it should be always esti- 
mated in the determination of the purity of the oil. It is assayed by 
the sulphite method as given under oil of caraway. If adulterated 
with a considerable quantity of oil of caraway, the polarization would 
be dextrorotatory. 

Uses. It enters into spirit of spearmint and spearmint water. 
The medicinal uses are the same as for peppermint preparations.

Myristica. The Federal standard for nutmeg is as follows : Nutmeg 
is the dried seed of the Myristica fragrans Houttuyn deprived of its 
testa, with or without a thin coating of lime, and contains not less 
than twenty-five (25) per cent, of non-volatile ether extract, not 
more than five (5) per cent, of total ash, not more than five-tenths 
(0.5) per cent, of ash insoluble in hydrochloric acid, and not more 
than ten (10) per cent, of crude fiber. 

Macassar nutmeg, Papua nutmeg, male nutmeg, long nutmeg, is the 
dried seed of Myristica argentea Warb. deprived of its testa. 

Packages containing nutmegs should be kept tightly closed and 
a few drops of chloroform or carbon tetrachloride added to prevent 
the attack of insects. Nutmegs are " limed" for the same reason. 
Some claim they are limed to kill the germ to prevent the growth so 
the cultivation will not be extended.

OLEUM SANTALI. 

Oil of Santal. Oil of Sandalwood. 

Essence de Santa! , Fr. Ostindisches Sandelholzol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from the wood of Santalum album Linn6 
(Fam. Santalaceae) , yielding not less than 90 per cent, of alcohols, 
calculated as santalol (Ci5H 26 = 222.21). Schimmel & Co. 1 state 
the only accurate formula for santalol is CisH^O. 

Santalum album is a tree which grows from 6 to 10 meters high 
and has dense foliage. It is indigenous to the mountains of India 
growing wild as well as being cultivated.

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C -15 to -20 

Soluble in 5 volumes of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Sandalwood oil contains santalol, santalal 
(Ci5H24O), santalic acid (CisH^iCy, and teresantalic acid (CioHuC^). 
Heusler 2 states that santalol is a mixture of two alcohols. One is 
known as "Gonorol" a-santalol (CisH^OH) which is a colorless, 
oily liquid, having a faint odor, and boiling at 300 to 301 C. 
Specific gravity 0.9854 at C., and the specific rotatory power is 
1.2. The other, b-santalol, (CisEkeOH), resembles its isomeride, 
boils at 309 to 310 C., and has a specific gravity of 0.9868 at C., 
and specific rotatory power of 56.

362 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Preparation and Yield. The oil is distilled by steam from the 
chipped wood and from sandalwood sawdust. The oil has been 
distilled in the United States from sandalwood imported from East 
India. The yield from distillation of many tons of wood, according to 
Dohme and Englehardt 1 was from 3.95 to 6.18 per cent. The yield 
from sawdust they give as 2.26 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of sandalwood is a pale yellow, somewhat 
thick liquid, having the characteristic odor and taste of sandalwood. 
U. S. P. 

The so-called West India sandalwood oil, cedarwood oil, terpineol, 
chloroform, castor oil and cottonseed oil are used as adulterants for 
sandalwood oil. Castor oil and cottonseed oil would decrease the 
optical rotation and reduce its solubility in 70 per cent, alcohol; 
cedarwood oil would increase and West Indian sandalwood oil decrease 
its rotation to the left. Any of these adulterants would reduce the 
percentage of santalol. 

Very little sandalwood oil distills under 160 C. at ordinary pres- 
sure, while 80 to 90 per cent, of cedarwood oil distills at 150 C. 
or below. 

The U. S. P. VIII gave a test for the detection of chloroform when 
used as an adulterant in sandalwood oil, as follows : 

The presence of chloroform may be detected in the following manner: 
If a small strip of filter paper folded in the form of a taper and saturated 
with oil of santal be placed in a small porcelain dish, and a clean 
beaker, moistened on the inner surface with distilled water, be in- 
verted over the small dish immediately after igniting the taper, a 
part of the products of combustion will be absorbed by the water: 
if the beaker be then rinsed with a little distilled water and the liquid 
filtered, the filtrate should yield no turbidity upon the addition of a 
few drops of silver nitrate T. S. (absence of chlorinated products). 

The Pharmacopoeial assay for santalol is as follows : 
Assay: Proceed as directed for menthol under Oleum Menthae 
Piperitae, using 10 cc. of oil of santal. Use the following formula 
in calculating the percentage of santalol in place of that given for 
menthol under Oleum Menthae Piperitae. 

A X 11.11 
Percentage of santalol = 



B - (AX 0.021) 

in which A is the result obtained by subtracting the number of cc. 
of half-normal sulphuric acid V. S. required in the titration from the 
number of cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide V. S. 
originally taken, and B is the weight of acetylized oil taken.

The author has examined a number of samples of commercial sandal- 
wood oil and the results of analysis are shown in the table on page 364. 

The fact must not be overlooked that fixed oils when added to 
sandalwood oil apparently increase the percentage of santalol when 
the United States Pharmacopoeial method of acetylization and 
saponification is employed and the calculation of santalol is based 
upon the U. S. P. formula. This is noticeable in the analysis of 
Sample No. 11. This would be equally true of other volatile oils 
when determining higher alcohols by above method. The author 
employed this method on pure cottonseed oil and used the formula for 
the calculation of santalol and it gave results indicating 96.93 per 
cent, of santalol. The absence of fixed oils must be ascertained 
before the estimation of santalol becomes of any analytical value in 
determining the purity of the oil under consideration. 

In 1920 1 the author called attention to the fact that the absence of 
saponifiable fixed oils should always be proven in the analysis of 
sandalwood oil; and later, C. W. Harrison 2 suggested a method for

the detection of the presence of fixed oil by the determination of the 
saponification number of the acetylated oil, as follows : 

Acetylate the oil according to the present method. 1 Weigh accurately and 
saponify with 50 cc. of alcoholic potash as directed, measuring at the same time 
with the same pipette, drained for the same length of time, another 50 cc. portion 
of the alcoholic potash solution to carry through as the blank. Titrate the blank 
and the sample with N/2 sulphuric acid and phenolphthalein, and subtract the 
number of cc. of acid required to neutralize the sample from the number required 

1 U. S. Pharmacopoeia IX, 1916, 296. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 365 

to neutralize the blank, thus obtaining the number of cc. of N/2 potassium hydroxide 
required to saponify the weight of oil taken: 

cc. N/2 potassium hydroxide X 28.06. 

Saponincation number of acetylated oil = - 

weight of oil taken 

After determining the saponification number of the acetylated oil, render the 
flask faintly alkaline with 1/2 drop of alcoholic potash, place on the steam bath, 
and dealcoholize. (This can be easily and quickly accomplished by using suction 
to remove alcohol vapors.) After the alcohol has been completely removed and the 
liquid in the flask reduced to a small volume, carefully transfer it to the modified 
Hortvet apparatus, and carefully rinse the flask with successive portions of dilute 
(approximately 10%) sulphuric acid, adding these to the volatile acid apparatus to 
which also a few drops of methyl orange test solution have been added. Continue 
the addition of dilute sulphuric acid until the contents of the tube are distinctly 
acid to methyl orange. This should not require more than 10-15 cc. of dilute acid. 
It is necessary to keep this volume as small as possible. Then steam distill the 
product. Most of the volatile acids pass over in the first 100 cc. of distillate, but 
about 300 cc. are required to carry over all traces of volatile acids. Next titrate 
the distillate with N/2 alkali and phenolphthalein, expressing the results as santalol 
according to the United States Pharmacopoeia method. 1 

Oil of Santalum album is properly sold as East India Sandal wood 
Oil, or simply sandalwood oil. The custom of labeling the oil of 
Amyris balsamifera "Oil Sandalwood, W. I." is, according to Federal 
Opinion Number 29, misleading in that confusion with true oil of 
sandalwood, which is official in the United States Pharmacopoeia, 
may easily result. 

Uses. SandaJwood oil is used extensively in perfumery and to a 
considerable extent in medicine. 

Santalol (CwEkeO), is a sesquiterpenic alcohol and sold under the 
trade name of "Arheol." Other trademark preparations of santalol 
are "Santyl," or a salicylic ester of santalol, 
"Carbosant," a carbonic ester of santalol, ( 
and "Thyresol," which is chiefly a methyl ether of santalol, CisH^s- 
OCH 2 .

OLEUM SINAPIS VOLATILE. 

Volatile Oil of Mustard. Mustard Oil. 

Essence de Moutarde, Fr. Senfol, G. 

A volatile oil, produced synthetically, or obtained from the seed 
of Brassica nigra (Linne) Koch (Fam. Cruciferae) (freed from fatty 
oil) by maceration with water and subsequent distillation. It yields 
not less than 92 per cent, of allyl isothiocyanate (C 3 H 5 SCN = 99.12). 
The label must indicate whether the oil has been made synthetically 
or obtained from black mustard. U. S. P. The volatile oil of mus- 
tard, or mustard oil, as it is commonly called, although used to a 
limited extent in the war, should not be confused with dichloro- 
diethylsulphide (mustard gas) (CH 2 C1CH 2 )2S, which was used so 
extensively.

368 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Principal Components. Allyl isothiocyanate (CH 2 :CH.CH 2 .NCS), 
a large percentage; allyl cyanide (CHa.CHiCH.CN); dimethyl 
sulphide (CH 3 .S.CH 3 ). 

Preparation and Yield. Mustard seed contains from 30 to 35 per 
cent, of fixed oil; however, the volatile oil of mustard, as such, is 
not contained in the seeds, but is formed by the albuminoid ferment, 
myrosin, acting upon the sinigrin. The press-cake, from which the 
fixed oil has been removed, is mixed with warm water at a temperature 
not to exceed 70. At a higher temperature no fermentation will 
take place owing to the myrosin being rendered inactive by coagulation. 
The reaction which takes place is represented as follows : 



H 2 = CSNC 3 H 5 + C 6 H 12 6 + KHS0 4 . 
Sinigrin. Water. Mustard Oil. Dextrose. Potassium acid 

sulphate. 

The yield of mustard oil varies from 0.5 to nearly 2.0 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Volatile oil of mustard is a colorless or pale 
yellow, strongly refractive liquid, having a very pungent and irritating 
odor and acrid taste. U. S. P. 

It should distil completely between 148 and 154 C. the first 
and last portions having the same specific gravity as the original oil. 
(absence of alcohol, chloroform, petroleum, or fatty oils.) 

The United States Pharmacopoeia method of assay is as follows: 

Assay: Dilute about 4 cc. of Volatile Oil of Mustard, accurately weighed, with 
sufficient alcohol to make exactly 100 cc. Transfer 5 cc. of this solution to a 100 cc. 
measuring flask, and add 50 cc. of tenth-normal silver nitrate V. S. and 5 cc. of 
ammonia water. Stopper the flask, connect it with a reflux condenser and heat 
it on a water bath during one hour. Allow it to cool, dilute the contents of the 
flask with distilled water to the 100 cc. mark, mix well and filter. Add 4 cc. of 
nitric acid and 2 cc. of ferric ammonium sulphate T. S. to 50 cc. of the filtrate and 
titrate the excess of the silver nitrate with tenth-normal potassium sulphocyanate 
V. S. 

When calculated from the weight of oil taken for the assay it shows not less than 
92 per cent, of allyl isothiocyanate. Each cc. of tenth-normal silver nitrate V. S. 
consumed corresponds to 0.004956 gm. of allyl isothiocyanate. 

Uses. Volatile oil of mustard is used in liniments as a counter- 
irritant. 

SINAPIS ALBA. 

White Mustard. Yellow Mustard. 

The ripe seeds of Sinapis alba Linne (Fam. Crutiferae), without the 
presence or admixture of more than 5 per cent, of other seeds or other 
foreign matter. U. S. P. 

White mustard is distinguished from black mustard as it does not 
yield allyl isothiocyanate upon steam distillation. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 369 

White mustard seed contain from 20 to 25 per cent, of a fixed oil, 
sinalbin, and myrosin. Sinalbin, in the presence of water, is acted 
upon by myrosin, and mustard oil is formed which is parahydroxy- 
benzyl-isothiocyanate (CTHyONCS), while the seed of Brassica nigra 
contains sinigrin which when similarly acted upon is converted into 
allyl isothiocyanate (C 3 H B SCN), or the official volatile oil of mustard. 

The Federal standards for mustard and mustard preparations are 
as follows. 

Mustard Seed is the seed of Sinapis alba L. (white mustard), Brassica nigra (L.) 
Koch (black mustard), or Brassica juncea (L.) Cosson (black or brown mustard). 

Ground mustard is a powder made from mustard seed, with or without the removal 
of the hulls and a portion of the fixed oil, and contains not more than two and five- 
tenths (2.5) per cent, of starch and not more than eight (8) per cent, of total ash. 

Prepared mustard, German mustard, French mustard, mustard paste, is a paste com- 
posed of a mixture of ground mustard seed or mustard flour, with salt, spices and 
vinegar, and, calculated free from water, fat and salt, contains not more than twenty- 
four (24) per cent, of carbohydrates, calculated as starch, determined according to 
the official methods; not more than twelve (12) per cent, of crude fiber, nor less 
than thirty-five (35) per cent, of protein, derived solely from the materials named. 

The protein and crude fiber should be determined according to the 
methods already given for making such determinations. For protein, 
use about 5 grams of the sample, and for crude fiber, use about 8 
grams (equivalent to about 2 grams of dry matter). 

A sample of prepared mustard as analyzed by the Bureau of Chem- 
istry Notice of Judgment No. 2869 gave the following results: 

Total solids 13.36 

Remaining water 5.94 

Salt 16.64 

Fat 19.38 

Crude fiber 7.99 

Nitrogen 3.59 

Protein, air dry 22.43 

Protein (salt, fat, and water free basis) 38.62 

Tumeric, approximately 75 

Adulteration of the product was alleged in the information for the 
reason that it was an inferior mustard and was colored with tumeric, 
an artificial coloring, in a manner whereby the appearance of a superior 
grade of mustard was simulated and the inferiority of the article was 
concealed. 

Brassica arvensis, or charlock, as an adulterant for true mustard 
seed has brought forth Food Inspection Decision 137, which is as 
follows : 

It has come to the attention of the Board of Food and Drug Inspection that the 
seed of charlock (Brassica arvensis L.) is being substituted by some manufacturers, 



370 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

in whole or in part, for that of the true mustards, viz., yellow or white mustard 
(Sinapis alba L. synonym Brassica alba (L.) Boiss., brown mustard (B. juncea L.), 
and black mustard (B. nigra L.). 

It is the opinion of the Board that when charlock is substituted in part for mustard 
the label should clearly indicate this fact. A condiment prepared from mustard or 
mustard flour and charlock with salt, spices, and vinegar is not 'Prepared Mustard,' 
but, provided a greater quantity of mustard than charlock is used, it should be called 
'Prepared Mustard and Charlock.'

Principal Components. Gum turpentine consists of d-pinene 
(CioHie), dipentine (i-limonene), cymene, and resinous matter. 

Preparation and Yield. Turpentine, as recognized by the United 
States Pharmacopoeia, is produced by steam distillation of the con- 
crete oleoresin (commonly called "gum") obtained from different 
species of pine. 

The analysis of terebinthina, the oleoresin secreted in the long- 
leaf pine, is given as follows : l 

Palabienic acid, Ci3H 2 oO 2 5 per cent. 

Palabietic acid, C 2 oH 3 oO 2 6 per cent. 

a- and b-Palabietiolic acid, Ci6H 24 O 2 56 per cent. 

Spirits of Turpentine t . . . 20 per cent. 

Paloresene 10 per cent. 

Impurities, bitter principle and water 3 per cent. 

The crude gum turpentine is obtained by "boxing," that is, cutting 
boxes in the trees, measuring about 14 inches in width, 7 inches deep, 
and 4 inches across, this being of sufficient size to hold the sap. To 
keep up the flow of crude turpentine the trees have to be wounded, 
or, as it is called, "chipped," each week. This chipping extends up 
the tree about eighteen inches each year, as each new cut is about 
one inch and the width of the box. Every few weeks as the boxes 
fill the crude turpentine is removed and hauled to the stills. 

Of late years the gum has been successfully obtained by the cup 
and gutter system. By this method gutters are placed in the trees 
and the exudation collected in cups suspended on zinc nails. Zinc 
nails are used to avoid damaging the saws when the trees are sub- 
sequently sawed into lumber. It is claimed for the cup and gutter 
system that a larger yield of gum is obtained ; also a superior quality 
of rosin, and the loss of trees by wind and fire is materially decreased. 

The gum is placed into copper stills of from 15 to 20 barrels capacity 
and heated by direct fire. Warm water is let into the still during 
distillation and the spirits of turpentine is collected in suitable vessels 
together with the water that condenses with it. The liquids are 
easily separated by reason of their different specific gravities. The 
rosin remaining in the still after the removal of the spirits of turpentine 
is strained and run into barrels.

372 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Herty 1 states : 

"For many years the commercial demand for rosin was very limited. Indeed at 
one time the price dropped so low that it was frequently the custom in North Carolina 
to distill the oil from the crude turpentine and turn the rosin into creeks and swamps. 
In these latter days of higher prices the rosin from these dumping grounds has been 
dug up, melted, strained and shipped to market. The cause of this increase in 
price is not difficult to discover. It is the manufacture of rosin oil. Of the total 
amount of rosin produced, about 10 per cent, is used for sizing, varnishes and minor 
matters, approximately 35 per cent, is used for soap making, while not less than 55 
per cent, is subjected to destructive distillation whereby rosin spirits, various rosin 
oils, brewer's pitch, etc., are obtained. As a substitute for an adulterant in linseed 
oil, as lubricants, in printer's ink and in many other ways, rosin oils are finding wider 
and wider application." 

The gum yields 20 per cent, oil of turpentine. The production of 
turpentine by distillation from the gum is carried on in the southern 
portion of the United States, and other methods of producing the oil 
are operated in both the southern and northern portion of the United 
States. 

A brief description of methods of manufacturing turpentine by 
steam and destructive distillation of wood will be given. 

Steam Distillation of Wood. Stumps, slabs, edgings, etc., of the 
resinous wood of the long leaf pine, Norway pine, and Douglas fir 
are cut into chips and placed into suitable stills and treated with steam. 
The distillate will consist of water, turpentine and pine oil. The 
oils and water, being immiscible, are readily separated. Good wood 
will yield from 12 to 16 gallons of oil per cord, itf per cent, of which 
is pine oil. 

Teeple 2 states in reference to the pine oil: 

"Three years ago the sale of long leaf pine oil was almost negligible, and the 
greater portions of those fractions of the distillate which contained the oil were 
thrown away without purification. Today the product is sold regularly in carload 
lots. As to its uses it has been found that it will dissolve any of the ordinary varnish 
gums sold, whereas in the usual methods of manufacturing varnishes the gums must 
be melted before they dissolve properly. This same solvent power makes it valuable 
in varnish works for washing filter cloths. It is likewise one of the best solvents for 
rubber. It can be added to a lacquer made from nitrocellulose. It is not of itself 
a rapid, hard drying oil and so is often used in the coating of insulated cables. The 
high price of oil camphor and the more stringent laws regarding the use of benzine 
have led to the substitution of pine oil almost exclusively for these two products in 
the manufacure of metal polishes. When properly refined it has a very pleasant 
odor which leads to its use by essential oil trade in general and by soap makers in 
particular for perfuming cheaper soaps." 

Pine wood has been worked for turpentine by steam distillation and 
afterwards the rosin extracted from the wood with a petroleum solvent.

The method is described as follows: The stumps, or dead wood, cut 
into cordwood sizes, are fed to a chipper and cut into chips three-eighths 
of an inch thick. These are conveyed to an extractor where super- 
heated steam is introduced and the spirits of turpentine is vaporized 
and condensed. The chips are then treated with a petroleum solvent 
that removes rosin, heavy turpentine and oil of pine, and by distilla- 
tion of the solution they are recovered, and the solvent rendered 
pure to be used over again an indefinite number of times. It must 
be understood that the yield of all these products varies with the 
grade of wood worked, but the average from a cord of fat wood is 
about as follows: 

First distillation of turpentine 12 to 16 gallons. 

Heavy turpentine 6 to 8 gallons. 

Oil of pine 2 to 5 gallons. 

Rosin yield 400 to 800 pounds. 

By Destructive Distillation of Wood. In destructive distillation of 
wood the same species of pine are used as in steam distillation, but 
the wood is not cut into chips; all that is necessary is to cut the wood 
into suitable lengths for the retort. Heat is applied direct to the 
retorts and a number of products are produced. Of the greater 
importance is turpentine, oil of tar, tar, and finally charcoal. In 
addition to turpentine and tar, the companies interested in this 
business place by-products upon the market such as wood preservers, 
disinfectants, sheep dip, and spraying material for fruit trees. In 
some cases these products, being sold under proprietary names, are 
of more financial value than the turpentine and tar.

Properties and Tests. Oil of turpentine is a colorless liquid having 
a characteristic odor and taste, both of which become stronger and 
less pleasant on aging or exposure to the air. U. S. P. 

Specifications for turpentine. (American Society for Testing 
Materials.) 

1. The specification applies both to the turpentine which is distilled from pine 
oleo-resins, and commonly known as gum turpentine or spirits of turpentine, and 
to the turpentine known as wood turpentine, which is obtained from resinous wood, 
either by extraction with volatile solvents, or by steam, or by destructive distillation. 
No attempt is made to differentiate between the two. The purchaser, when ordering, 
should specify whether gum or wood turpentine is desired. 

2. The turpentine must be clear and free from suspended matter and water. 

3. The color shall be standard. 

4. The specific gravity at 15.5 C. shall be not less than 0.860 or more than 0.875. 

5. The refractive index at 15.5 C. shall be not less than 1.468 or more than 1.478. 

6. The initial boiling point must lie between 150 and 160 C. 

7. Ninety per cent, of the turpentine shall distill below 170 C. 

8. The polymerization residue shall not exceed 1 per cent., and its refractive index 
at 15.5 C. shall be not less than 1.500. 

Polarization may not give direct information as to purity, but is 
helpful in determining the locality where the turpentine is produced. 
Most of the American gum spirits of turpentine is produced from Pinus 
palustris (Long Leaf Pine), or Pinus heterophylla (Cuban or Slash 
Pine) both species growing in the Southern States. The oil produced 
from Long Leaf Pine is dextrorotatory and that from the Cuban Pine 
levorotatory. As the Long Leaf Pine predominates in the South, the 
turpentine produced is dextrorotatory, and that in the North, by 
destructive distillation from Norway Pine, is levorotatory.

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS 375 

The gum turpentine is adulterated by the addition of "wood tur- 
pentine," and both the gum and wood turpentine are adulterated by 
the addition of petroleum products. 

The usual test for the detection of wood turpentine as given by 
Flatch 1 is to shake 2 cc. of the sample with 1 cc. of concentrated sulphur 
dioxide solution. A bright yellow or greenish coloration will be given 
by all turpentine oils obtained from wood. 

The addition of wood turpentine also reduces the iodine value of gum 
turpentine. The iodine value of gum turpentine generally runs from 
370 to 385 and for wood turpentine about 210 to 215. For rosin 
spirits 180 to 190. For rosin oil 112 to 115. 

Rosin oil would be detected by adding acetic anhydride and 1 drop 
of sulphuric acid which will produce an intense green color if rosin 
spirits are present. The above test was proposed by Valenta 2 as 
well as a test for the detection of " essence of turpentine." The 
so-called " essence of turpentine" is the portion that distills between 
160 and 220 C. in the dry distillation of colophony for resin oil. 
The test for essence of turpentine is as follows: One part of oil is 
mixed with 1 to 2 parts of a 6 per cent, solution of iodine in chloroform 
or carbon tetrachloride, warmed gently on a water bath, an intense 
green or olive green color is produced in case of essence of turpentine. 
This reaction is not given by any of the following: Oil of turpentine, 
pine resin oils, light petroleum, oil of camphor, or resin oil. 

Another color test for rosin spirit is as follows: The sample of 
the suspected oil is distilled and that portion which passes over at 
170 C. is heated with an equal portion of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and a small piece of zinc for five minutes in a boiling waterbath, 
shaking the mixture frequently during the heating. If rosin oil is 
present, emerald green color develops. 3 

Mineral oil is the most common adulterant of turpentine as given 
by McGill. 4 In one lot of 158 samples he found 42 to be adulterated 
with petroleum. 

Federal Notices of Judgment published also indicate that mineral 
oil is the most common adulterant in this country. 

Nash's Bead Test. By shaking pure oil of turpentine the bead 
formed breaks up instantaneously, while with turpentine adulterated 
with petroleum the bead lasts for some time. 5 

The method of polymerization of turpentine with concentrated 
sulphuric acid to detect petroleum products was first suggested by

PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 



Armstrong 1 in 1882, a d it is the method in general use for the detec- 
tion and estimation of such adulterants. 

The American Society for Testing Materials instructions for apply- 
ing the polymerization test is as follows: Twenty cc. of sulphuric 
acid (concentrated) are placed in a graduated Babcock bottle, and 
cooled by placing the flask in ice water. Five cc. of the turpentine are 
then added slowly and mixed with the acid, the temperature not being 
allowed to rise above 60 C. When the mixture no longer warms up 
on shaking, it is agitated thoroughly; the flask is then placed for ten 
minutes in a water bath at 60 C., and shaken occasionally to prevent 
separation. After cooling at room temperature, the flask is filled 
with concentrated sulphuric acid until the unpolymerized oil rises 
into the graduated neck; it is then subjected to centrifugal action 
(1,200 revolutions per minute) for five minutes, and, after standing for 
twelve hours, the volume of the unpolymerized residue is read off. 

Burton 2 claims that by the action of concentrated nitric acid upon 
a mixture of turpentine and petroleum the terpenes are converted into 
polymers of a tarry consistency, which are soluble in water, while the 
petroleum is very slightly affected. However, sulphuric acid is now 
most generally used in the polymerization of turpentine. 

The unpolymerized residue from pure turpentine oil has a refractive 
index greater than the original oil. If adulterated with petroleum 
products the refractive index of the residue after polymerization is 
less than the original oil. 

Frey 3 recommends for the separation of turpentine from petroleum 
the shaking of one volume of the sample with three volumes of aniline 
oil, for five minutes. The aniline oil dissolves the turpentine and the 
petroleum spirit rises to the top. By using a graduated tube the 
percentage is thus obtained. However, Shrewsbury 4 states that this 
method is only applicable when the percentage of adulteration is 
between 30 and 70 per cent. 

A color test for the detection of pine oil in turpentine is given by 
Piest 6 and is as follows : A mixture of 5 cc. of acetic anhydride with 
10 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid is shaken and allowed to 
cool, after which an additional 10 drops of hydrochloric acid are 
added and the mixture again shaken. Pure turpentine remains 
transparent and light yellow, pine oil becomes black. It is claimed 
that 10 per cent, of pine oil will give a distinct coloration and that

it should be distilled and the test applied to the distillate. 

Uses. Oil of turpentine is used in medicine as a liniment and to 
some extent it is used internally. The rectified oil of turpentine, only, 
should be used internally. 

Oil of turpentine is used in large quantities for paint and varnish 
manufacture, as well as being used for many technical purposes. 

By-Products. Colophony, rosin or resin is the residue after dis- 
tilling the volatile oil from the concrete oleoresin in the preparation of 
oil of turpentine. Medicinally it is used in the preparation of resin 
plaster, but its commercial value is due mainly to its being the source 
of rosin oil. Rosin is used in the manufacture of cheap varnishes, 
also as a sizing for paper. 

Rosin Oil. When colophony is dry-distilled it undergoes decom- 
position and yields many substances, the most important of which is 
rosin oil.

Pitch 3.7 per cent. 

Gases, loss, etc 6.2 per cent. 

Rosin oil is soluble in ethyl alcohol, carbon disulphide, turpentine, 
and in a mixture of phenol and glycerol. Spayd takes advantage of 
the non-solubility of mineral oils in phenol to separate mineral oils 
from mixtures with rosin oils. He states that the best proportions 
are two volumes phenol to one volume of alcohol and three times 
as much of the mixture of phenol and alcohol as of the oil mixture. 

In testing for rosin oil, Spayd 2 modifies the Liebermann-Storch 
test and applies it as follows : About two cc. of the sample are boiled 
with 10 cc, of acetic anhydride, and then 10 cc. of water added. 
After cooling, the aqueous layer is filtered through a wet filter and then 
1 drop of concentrated sulphuric acid added to the filtrate. A beauti- 
ful fugitive color is produced if rosin oils to the amount of 0.5 to 1 
per cent, are present. By boiling with acetic anhydride and filtering,

does not as a general rule give a clear acid solution. 

Uses. Rosin oil is used in the manufacture of paints and for the 
adulteration of linseed oil. Rosin oil mixed with lime is used as an 
axle grease.

OLEUM THYMI. 
Oil of Thyme. 

Essence de Thym, Fr. Thymianol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from the flowering plant of Thymus vulgaris 
Linn6 (Fam. Labiatae), and containing not less than 20 per cent., by 
volume, of phenols. 

Thyme grows wild in southern France and Spain. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, the United States imported 
102,973 pounds of oil of thyme. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.894 to 0.930 

Refractive index at 20 C. (white thyme) (Author) 1.4903 

Refractive index at 20 C. (red thyme) (Author) 1.4925 

Optical rotation, slightly levorotatory. 
Soluble in 2 volumes 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. The phenols thymol and carvacol; the 
alcohols linalool and borneol; bornyl acetate, and menthane are the 
principal constituents present in oil of thyme. 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by the steam distillation of 
the flowering plant. Yield, 1 to 2 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. The oil of thyme is a colorless or red liquid, 
having a characteristic odor and taste. U. S. P. 

The color of the red oil or unrectified oil is said to be produced by 
the action of the iron of the stills upon the phenolic constituents. 
The phenols are determined according to the Pharmacopoeial method 
as follows: Seventy-five cc. of sodium hydroxide test solution are 
introduced into a cassia flask, and 10 cc. of the oil added. Shake 
the mixture thoroughly and let stand for twelve to twenty-four hours. 
Then add sufficient sodium hydroxide solution to raise the lower 
limit of the oily layer within the graduated portion of the neck of 
the flask, and after the alkaline solution has become clear, adjust 
it to the temperature at which it was measured, and note the volume 
of the residual liquid. This measures not more than eight cc., indi- 
cating the presence of not less than 20 per cent., by volume, of phenols. 

Turpentine appears to be the common adulterant for oil of thyme 
according to the Notices of Judgment published by the United States 
Department of Agriculture. 

Uses. Oil of thyme is extensively used in veterinary practice, and 
in the manufacture of cheap soap, perfumery, and as an antiseptic.

Oleum Gaultheriae, U. S. P. VIII. Oil of Wintergreen; Oleum 
Betulae, U. S. P. VIII. Oil Sweet Birch. Oil of Teaberry. 

It contains not less than 98 per cent, of CH 3 C 7 H503(152.06). It is 
produced synthetically or is obtained by distillation from Gaultheria 
procumbens Linn6 (Fam. Ericaceae) or from Betula lenta Linn6 (Fam. 
Betulaceae). U. S. P. 

There were produced in the United States in 1914, 41,178 pounds of 
birch and 6,000 pounds of wintergreen oils. Wintergreen and birch 
are indigenous to the United States.

Principal Components. Methyl salicylate contains, probably as 
impurities, ortho- and meta-creosotic acids. Gaultheria oil contains 
in addition to methyl salicylate, paraffin, an aldehyde or ketone, a 
secondary alcohol, and an ester, while oil of birch does not contain 
the alcohol. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of gaultheria is steam distilled from 
wintergreen leaves as well as from the entire plant. The yield is from 
0.586 to 0.8 per cent. Breisch l states that birch saplings are cut 
up into small pieces 4 or 5 inches in length and then placed in a box- 
shaped still. Sufficient quantity of water is added to cover the wood 
and allowed to mascerate from eight to twelve hours. The fire is then 
started and distillation continues from eight to ten hours, although 
90 per cent, of the oil passes over in the first two hours. The average 
yield is about 0.38 per cent. 

Beringer 2 prepared synthetic methyl salicylate by dissolving J ounce 
of salicylic acid in 2 ounces of absolute methyl alcohol, and then 
gradually adding 1 ounce of sulphuric acid. After heating gently 
for twenty-four hours the product was steam distilled. 

Thayer 3 claims the use of ordinary methyl alcohol arid hydro- 
chloric acid in the manufacture of this preparation is superior to the 
use of absolute methyl alcohol and sulphuric acid. 

Properties and Tests. It is a colorless, yellowish or reddish liquid, 
having the characteristic odor and taste of gaultheria. U. S. P. 

The United States Pharmacopoeia method of assay is as follows: 
Introduce about 2 cc. of methyl salicylate into a tared flask, note the 
exact weight, and add 50 cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide, reflux for two hours. Add a few drops of phenolphthalein 
and titrate with half-normal hydrochloric acid. It shows not less 
than 98 per cent, of CH 3 C7H 5 03. 

Each cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide consumed 
corresponds to 0.07603 gram of CH 3 C7H 5 3 . Each gram of methyl 
salicylate corresponds to not less than 12.9 cc. half-normal alcoholic 
potassium hydroxide. 

One cc. of methyl salicylate agitated with 10 cc. of potassium 
hydroxide test solution should produce a clear or slightly cloudy

solution, without the separation of oily drops which would denote the 
absence of other volatile oils or petroleum products. 

When a few drops of methyl salicylate are shaken with water and a 
drop of ferric chloride added a deep violet color should be produced. 

Watson and Sayre l claim that colors will be produced to distinguish 
between true oil of wintergreen, oil of birch, and methyl salicylate by 
treating 1 cc. of the oil in a test tube with 2 cc. concentrated sulphuric 
acid. Add 1 cc. saturated aqueous solution of chloral hydrate. With 
oil of wintergreen a green color develops a dark green oil-layer above 
a lighter green zone. Oil of birch gives a deep violet oil-layer. The 
synthetic methyl salicylate produces no color except after long stand- 
ing, when a faint violet color may develop. 

Pancoast and Pearson 2 give the bead test, which consists in violently 
shaking the container and noting the rapidity with which the foam 
disappears. The foam formed with methyl salicylate rapidly dis- 
appears, while the foam from the natural oils has much more per- 
manency. The authors cited state this test is not very reliable, 
which is in accord with the writer's experience. 

It is a question if any method so far reported will positively identify 
the three substances in mixtures, and no doubt large quantities of 
oil of birch and the synthetic product are sold in mixtures as pure oil 
of wintergreen. However, Schimmel & Co. 3 state they are in a 
position to fully differentiate between synthetic oil, sweet birch oil, 
and oil of wintergreen leaves. 

When to 5 drops of the oil and 5 drops of a 5 per cent, alcoholic 
solution of vanillin is added 1 cc. of alcohol and the solution is shaken 
with 2 cc. of concentrated sulphuric acid, pure oil of gaultheria will 
produce an intense crimson color, pure oil of birch a deep blood-red 
color, while synthetic methyl salicylate gives a yellow color. 

Of 32 Federal Notices of Judgment of adulteration of oils of gaul- 
theria and birch, methyl salicylate was practically the only adulterant, 
except in the case of wintergreen, when in a few cases, oil of birch and 
methyl salicylate were both used, as represented in No. 4596. The 
result of analysis as given under Notice of Judgment No. 4704 is 
as follows: 

Bead test positive 

Vanillin positive 

Optical rotation at 20 C. -0.19 

Specific gravity at 15.6/15.6 C 1.1879 

Ester as methyl salicylate 98.9

VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 385 

Gibbs l calls attention to the fact that as methyl salicylate, or the 
natural methyl esters, are commonly used as flavoring in non-alcoholic 
beverages, and also in medicinal preparations, and that as salicylic 
acid is found in methyl salicylate as an impurity, and also is formed by 
the hydrolysis of the ester, care should be taken in the analysis of such 
preparations not to report added salicylic acid when only pure methyl 
salicylate has been used. 

Uses. As indicated above, methyl salicylate is used as a flavoring, 
and in medicine in liniments. It is used in many preparations for 
rheumatic troubles.

OLEUM BERGAMOTTAE. 
Oil of Bergamot. 

Essence de Bergamotte, Fr. Bergamottol, G. 

A volatile oil obtained by expression from the rind of the fresh 
fruit of Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Risso et Poiteau) Wright et 
Arnott (Fam. Rutaceae), and containing not less than 36 per cent, of 
ester, calculated as linalyl acetate, N. F. The oil is prepared in 
France. 

For the year ending June 30, 1920, there were imported into the 
United States 92,708 pounds of bergamot oil. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.875 to 0.880 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4710 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C +8 to +24 

Soluble in 2 volumes 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Ester as linalyl acetate not less than 36 per cent. 

Principal Components. Linalyl acetate, linalool, limonene, limettin, 
acetic acid, octylene, pinene, camphene and limene. 1 

Preparation and Yield. Bergamot oil is obtained by expression 
of the fresh peel of the ripe fruit of bergamot. An inferior oil is 
produced by steam distillation of the expressed rinds. Rectification 
deprives the oil of its green color which is due to chlorophyll. In 
distilling bergamot oil the esters are decomposed and thus reduced 
in amount. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of bergamot is a green or greenish-yellow 
liquid, neutral or only faintly acid, having a characteristic fragrant 
odor and aromatic, bitter taste. N. F. 

If the green color is due to copper it would be detected by shaking 
out with hydrochloric acid. Add water and shake. After separation 
has taken place apply the usual tests for copper to the aqueous solu- 
tion. 

Adulterants for oil of bergamot are distilled bergamot oil, lemon oil, 
tri-ethyl citrate, glyceryl acetate, orange oil and turpentine. They 
all lower the ester value except tri-ethyl citrate. 

Upon evaporation on a boiling water bath the residue should not 
exceed 6 per cent. According to Schimmel & Co., 2 this residue will

1 Semi-Annual Rep., Oct., 1910, 57. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 389 

contain the bulk of any added tri-ethyl citrate. They determine 
the added ester by evaporating 5 grams of bergamot oil on the water 
bath to constant weight, which requires 4 or 5 hours. The residue is 
completely transferred with alcohol to a saponification flask, and the 
saponification value determined in the usual way. The saponification 
value of pure oil of bergamot they gave as from 136 to 180, while if 
tri-ethyl citrate is present the saponification value will vary from 
253 to 261 according to the amount of added ester. 

Schimmel & Co. give, in the report already referred to, a method 
for the determination of glyceryl acetates when added as an adulterant 
to bergamot oil. The method is as follows: Ten cc. of the sample is 
mixed in a separatory funnel with 10 cc. light petroleum and 2.5 cc. 
of alcohol, and vigorously shaken with 20 cc. of water. This is allowed 
to settle about 10 minutes and the aqueous liquid filtered off. Of the 
filtrate, 10 cc. is neutralized with potassium hydroxide solution and 
then saponified by boiling one hour with 5 cc. half-normal alcoholic 
potassium hydroxide. In case of pure bergamot oil the 10 cc. of 
filtrate requires for saponification 

0.08 cc. half-normal potassium hydroxide solution = 2.2 mg. KOH. 
After adding 1% glyceryl tri-acetate, 0.58 cc. = 16.2 mg. KOH. 
After adding 2% glyceryl tri-acetate, 1.43 cc. = 40.0 mg. KOH. 
After adding 5% glyceryl tri-acetate, 2.79 cc. = 78.0 mg. KOH. 

Hence the addition of 1 per cent, glyceryl tri-acetate requires about 
15 mg. KOH more. 

Dowzard 1 examined twenty-three samples of bergamot oil as 
given on the following page. 

The solubility as reported by him was determined by mixing 5 cc. 
of the oil with 10 cc. of alcohol (sp. gr. 0.799 at 15.5 C.) and then 
running in water from a burette, drop by drop, until the solution 
became turbid. The number of cc. of water required to produce the 
turbidity was multiplied by 100 the result being termed the " solu- 
bility value." 

Chlorinated compounds, when present in oil of bergamot, are de- 
tected as follows: To 20 grams of the sample add 10 cc. of half-normal 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution and evaporate to dryness. 
Incinerate and extract the ash with dilute nitric acid. A solution of 
silver nitrate should not produce a cloudiness. 

The linalyl acetate is determined as follows: Saponify 2 grams of 
the oil by boiling under a reflux condenser for one-half hour, with 
20 cc. half-normal potassium hydroxide solution. Cool and add 100 
cc. of water and titrate with half -normal sulphuric acid, using phenol-

wood of Betula alba Linn6 (Fam. Betulaceae), rectified by steam 
distillation. N. F. 

There were imported into the United States during the year ending 
June 30, 1920, 220 pounds of oil of birch tar. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.886 to 0.950 

Forms a clear solution with 3 volumes dehydrated alcohol. 

Principal Components. Probetulin 10 to 12 per cent., pyrocatechin, 
phenols, 43.9 per cent., terebene, guaiacol, cresol and xylenol. 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by destructive distillation 
of the wood and bark. 

Properties and Tests. Rectified oil of birch tar is a limpid, dark 
brown liquid having a penetrating, empyreumatic odor resembling 
that of Russian leather, N. F. 

It forms a clear solution with benzene, carbon disulphide, ether, 
chloroform, glacial acetic acid, and amyl alcohol. When one volume 
of oil of birch tar is mixed with three volumes of alcohol only a slight 
turbidity should appear, but when mixed with the same volume of 
methyl alcohol a decided turbidity appears. 

A test to differentiate between oil of birch tar and oil of cade is 
given in the National Formulary as follows: Warm 2 cc. of the oil 
with 10 cc. of distilled water, agitate and allow the mixture to cool; 
separate and filter the aqueous liquid. The filtrate is colorless, has 
a strong, empyreumatic odor and an acid reaction. Add 2 drops of 
potassium dichromate test solution to 4 cc. of the same aqueous 
filtrate; it produces a bright yellow solution which becomes darker 
and turbid. Add 1 drop of dilute ferric chloride solution (1 in 100) 
to 4 cc. of the filtrate; it produces a green coloration which changes to 
brown and becomes turbid (distinction from oil of cade).

Principal Components. According to Schimmel & Co., 1 eugenol, 
myrcene, chavicol, methyl-eugenol, methyl-chavicol, phellandrene, 
and citral. 

Preparation and Yield. In West India Islands, where the bay leaves 
are native, the green leaves are distilled with salt water. The yield 
is said to be 1.2 to 1.3 per cent, of oil. The dry bay leaves brought 
to the United States and distilled are said to yield as high as 2.0 and 
2.5 per cent, of oil of bay. On distillation the oil comes over in two 
portions, one lighter and the other heavier than water. When the 
two fractions are mixed the oil has a specific gravity which conforms 
to the specific gravity as given above. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of myrcia is a yellow or brownish-yellow 
liquid having a pleasant, aromatic odor and a pungent, spicy taste. 
N. F. 

Oil of bay is adulterated with oils of cloves and allspice, also with 
phenols. Tests for the detection of these adulterations are given in 
the National Formulary as follows : 

To 3 drops of the oil, contained in a small test tube, add 3 drops 
of sulphuric acid, cork the test tube and allow the mixture to stand 
for half an hour; a resinous mass is obtained. Add 4 cc. of diluted 
alcohol to this mass, vigorously shake the mixture, and gradually heat 
on a water bath to the boiling point; the liquid remains nearly color- 
less and does not acquire a red or purplish-red color (distinction from 
oil of pimenta or oil of cloves). 

Shake 1 cc. of the oil with 20 cc. of water and filter. The filtrate 
should not give a violet color with ferric chloride solution (absence 
of phenol.) When the oil is mixed with an equal volume of con- 
centrated solution of sodium hydroxide a semi-solid mass should form.

of which show the quantity present. They found the average amount 
of phenols from nine samples to be 62 per cent. 

Uses. Used mostly as a perfume and in the preparation of bay 
rum. Although the finest quality of bay rum is manufactured by 
distilling bay leaves with rum, a large proportion of this article is 
prepared by simply dissolving oil of bay in diluted alcohol. Oil of 
bay as well as bay rum were official in the 1890 United States Pharma- 
copoeia, but they were both dropped in the last edition of the 
Pharmacopoeia.

OLEUM ABSINTHII. 
Oil of Wormwood. 

Essence d' Absinthe, Fr. Wermutol, G. 
A volatile oil distilled from Artemisia absinthium L. 
Wormwood is cultivated in New York, Wisconsin and Nebraska. 
In 1914 the United States produced 4,702 pounds of oil of wormwood. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.925 to 0.955 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4741 

Soluble in 2 to 4 volumes of 80 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Thujone, thujyl alcohol, free and combined 
with acetic, isovalerianic and palmitic acids; phellandrene and pos- 
sibly pinene ; cadinene, blue oil, the elementary composition of which 
has not yet been definitely determined. 1 

Preparation and Yield. The oil is prepared by steam distillation 
of the dry plant. The yield is from J to 1 per cent, of oil. The yield 
from the plant cultivated in Wayne County, New York, was 30 pounds 
of the oil per acre. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of wormwood is a dark green, occasionally 
blue, liquid, having the odor of the plant and a bitter, and pungent 
taste. 

Turpentine oil appears to be the principal adulterant. The first 
10 per cent, of the distillate should be soluble in 2 volumes of 80 per 
cent, alcohol. 

The French absinthe, a liqueur which is said to be very poisonous, 
or much more so than ordinary alcoholic drinks, is prepared from 
absinthium and its poisonous properties are no doubt due to the small 
amount of oil of absinthium present. 

Schimmel & Co., 2 describes Duparc and Monnier's method for the 
determination of thujone in liqueurs as follows: Ten cc. of a solution 
of the sample in 60 per cent, alcohol are treated with 2 cc. zinc sulphate 
solution (1 : 10) and afterwards with 0.5 cc. of a solution of sodium 
nitro prusside (1 : 10). After shaking, 4 cc. of 5 per cent, sodium 
hydroxide solution, free from carbonic acid, are added, and one minute 
later 2 to 3 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The currant-colored precipitate 
formed is claimed to indicate the presence of thujone even in dilutions 
up to 1 : 5000. It settles in the course of a few minutes. If a garnet- 
red coloration should ensue upon the addition of the acetic acid, it can 
be removed by shaking with ether. In the case of all other bodies 
which have been investigated, citral excepted, the precipitate is of a

OLEUM ANDROPOGONI CITRATI. 

Oil of Lemon-grass. 

Essence de Lemongrass, Fr. Lemorigrasol, G. 
Oil of lemon-grass is obtained from the fresh grass of Andropogon 
citratus. Lemon-grass and citronella both belong to the Andropogon 
family but are of different species and yield oils which have to a 
certain extent similar components. Lemon-grass oil is produced in 
India, Ceylon and Cochin China. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.895 to 0.905 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4913 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C +3 to 3 

Soluble in two to three volumes of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Mainly citral (85 per cent.), geraniol, and 
small amounts of citronellal, cymene, limonene and normal decyl 
aldehyde. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of lemon-grass is obtained by distilla- 
tion of the fresh grass which yields from 0.24 to 0.4 per cent, of the oil. 

Properties and Tests. Lemon-grass oil is a brownish-red colored 
liquid, with a strong verbene or lemon-like odor. 

Lemon-grass oil is adulterated with fatty oils and liquid petrolatum. 
These adulterants may be detected by their not being soluble in 70 
per cent, alcohol. 

Oil of lemon-grass should contain not less than 70 per cent, of citral 
when assayed by the sulphite method given under oil of caraway. 
The number of cc. of oil going into solution being regarded as citral. 

Uses. Lemon-grass oil is used in perfumery, and it is claimed that 
it is used as an adulterant for lemon oil.

OLEUM LIGNI CEDERI. 
Oil of Cedar Wood. 

. Essence de Bois de Cedre, Fr. Cedernholzol, G. 
A volatile oil distilled from the wood of Juniperus virginiana L., a 
shrub or tree growing throughout the United States. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.960 

Refractive index at 20 C 1.4984 

Optical rotation in a 100 mm. tube at 25 C -25 to -40 

Soluble in 10 to 20 parts 90 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. It contains the so-called cedar-camphor or 
cedrol, cedrene, cedrenol, and pseudo-cedrol. 1 

Preparation and Yield. Cedarwood oil is prepared by steam dis- 
tillation from the waste wood from the manufacture of lead pencils 
and cigar boxes. The yield of oil is from 2.5 to 4.5 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Cedarwood oil is a colorless or yellowish 
liquid and has a mild persistent odor, characteristic of cedarwood. 

Cedarwood oil from Juniperus virginiana is apt to be adulterated 
by the use of other species of cedar wood in its manufacture. 

Cedar leaf oil, distilled from the leaves of Juniperus virginiana, 
and often mixed with the leaves of other species of cedar, is an article 
of commerce. It has constants as follows : 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.887 

Refractive index at 20 C. (Author) 41.677 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C +59 25' 

The optical rotation is noticeable as it is just opposite to that of the 
oil of the wood of the same species of Juniperus. 

Schorger 2 has made an examination of the oil produced from the 
incense cedar (Libocedrus decurrens Torrey) of California and has

Uses. Cedar wood oil is used as a soap perfumery; with oil-immer- 
sion lenses in microscopical work, and as an adulterant for other oils 
especially for sandal wood oil; but owing to its optical rotation and 
specific gravity it is easily detected when so used.

OLEUM CITRONELLAE. 

Oil of Citronella. 

Essence de Citronelle, Fr. Citronellol, G. 

Oil of citronella is distilled from the grass Andropogon nardus L. 
Andropogon nardus is indigenous to Ceylon, India and the Malaccan 
Peninsula. 

There were imported into the United States for the year ending June 
30, 1920, 1,062,821 pounds of oil of citronella and lemon-grass. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C. (Schimmel & Co.) 0.900 to 0.920 

Refractive index at 20 C. (Author) 1.4857 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C -5 to -21 

Principal Components. The aldehyde citronellal (Ci Hi 8 0), (Ceylon 
oils contain 10.8 to 11.6 per cent, and Java oils from 36 to 40 per cent, 
of citronellal when assayed according to the United States Pharma- 
copoeial method for oil of lemon); terpens 10 to 15 per cent.; methyl- 
eugenol, borneol and geraniol. 

The better grades of Java oils contain 80 to 91 per cent, of total 
geraniol (= geraniol + citronellal) while the Ceylon oils contain 54.1 
to 57.6 per cent. 

Preparation and Yield. The grass which is cultivated yields more 
in the summer season (on an average 352 to 440 ounces of oil per acre) 
than in the winter season (from 110 to 220 ounces of oil per acre). 

Oil of citronella is prepared by direct distillation with steam without 
the addition of water to the dry grass. In some cases the distillation 
is conducted by direct fire and then water is necessarily added to the 
dry grass. 

Properties and Tests. Citronella oil is of a pale yellow to a yellow- 
ish-brown color. It has a strong and characteristic odor of citronella. 
It sometimes has a greenish color due to traces of copper. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 399 

The common adulterants are petroleum products and fatty oils 
which may be detected by Schimmel's Test l as follows : Citronella 
oil must give a clear solution with 1 to 2 volumes 80 per cent, alcohol 
at 20 C., and the solution must remain clear or at most show only 
a slight opalescence upon the addition of up to 10 volumes 80 per 
cent, alcohol. After standing several hours no drops of oil should 
separate out from the solution. Schimmel's "Increased Test" is 
to add 5 per cent, of Russian petroleum to the sample. It should then 
stand the 80 per cent, alcohol test. 

The total geraniol content of citronella oil is determined as follows: 
10 cc. each of citronella oil and acetic anhydride with 2 g. anhydrous 
sodium acetate and a few fragments of porous plate (in order to pre- 
vent the liquid from bumping) are kept boiling at an equal tempera- 
ture in an acetylation flask for 2 hours on the sand bath. When the 
mixture has cooled, a little water is added to the contents of the flask 
and the whole is heated for a quarter of an hour upon the water bath 
under frequent shaking in order to decompose the excess of acetic 
anhydride. The oil is then separated in a separating funnel and 
washed with water or, better still, with a solution of common salt until 
it gives a neutral reaction. Of the acetylated oil dried with anhydrous 
sulphate of sodium, 1.5 to 2 g. is saponified with 20 cc. of seminormal 
potash liquor, any free acid which may have been present having been 
previously carefully neutralized. The time of saponification must be 
at least one hour. 

Uses. It is used largely as a perfumery in hair oil and soaps.

400 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Principal Components. The sesquiterpene, caryophyllene (Ci6H 24 ), 
is the only known constituent. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of copaiba is obtained by steam dis- 
tillation of copaiba. The yield is variously given from 40 to 90 
per cent. 

Properties and Tests. A colorless cr pale yellow liquid, having the 
characteristic odor of copaiba and an aromatic, slightly bitter and 
pungent taste. 

The adulterants found in the oil are turpentine, fixed oils and oil 
of gurjun balsam. 

Turpentine is detected by steam distillation. The oil of turpentine, 
boiling at 154 to 170 C., distills before the oil of copaiba, which 
has a boiling point of 240 to 250 C. The odor of oil of turpentine 
is detected if the first few drops of the distillate are heated on a watch 



Castor oil which is used as an adulterant for copaiba balsam would 
be detected if used to adulterate copaiba oil by the test proposed by 
Maupy 1 which depends upon the fact that castor oil yields sebacic 
acid and caprylic alcohol on dry distillation with excess of alkali. 
Sebacic acid is insoluble in cold water, but soluble in hot water. 
The test is made by heating 10 grams of the sample in a silver dish 
with dry caustic potash. The mass is stirred until volatile oily 
matters have been driven off, during which process the presence of 
castor oil can be detected by the odor of caprylic alcohol. 

Kebler 2 states that the glacial acetic acid test gives reliable results 
for the detection of gurjun balsam even when not more than 5 per 
cent, is present. The test is as follows: Place 1 cc. of glacial acetic 
acid in a test tube; to this add 4 drops of pure, concentrated nitric 
acid; mix well; then add to this mixture, carefully, 4 drops of the 
balsam (or oil) in question; if gurjun balsam (or oil) is present, a 
reddish zone will be formed between the layer of balsam and the acid 
mixture in a few minutes. 

African copaiba distilled by Umney 3 yielded 39 per cent, of a volatile 
oil which gave the following data upon analysis : 

Specific gravity at 16 C 0.9185 

Optical rotation in 200 mm. tube at 16 C +20 42' 

Soluble in equal weight of petroleum ether. 

Soluble in 3 volumes of ether. 

Soluble in 7 volumes of glacial acetic acid. 

Uses. Copaiba oil is a diuretic and stimulant.

It should distill for the most part between 175 C. and 180 C. 

Principal Components. It consists mostly of d-limonene. 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by steam distillation of the 
fresh herb. The yield of oil is from 0.2 to 1.0 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. A pale yellow, limpid liquid, becoming 
darker and thicker by age and exposure to the air, having a peculiar, 
aromatic, persistent odor, and an aromatic, slightly pungent taste. 
U. S. P. 1890. 

There seems to be a number of conflicting statements in regard to 
the optical rotation of oil of erigeron. Todd 1 determined the rotary 
power of 8 samples of the oil, which were distilled by himself, and the 
variations were from 23 to 60 with an average of 47.19. 
He claims oil of erigeron is adulterated with oil of fireweed (oleum 
erechthitis hieracifoliae) and found 5 samples of his own distillation 
of oil of fireweed to polarize as follows : 

Polarization

5... . 0.907 +44.0 



Average 0.8732 +22.0 

iAm. J. Ph., 1887,59,305. 



402 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Todd found upon fractional distillation of 100 pounds of erigeron 
oil which polarized 50.5 that each 5-pound fraction up to and 
including the fourteenth fraction polarized + 8 to + 15, six of the 
fractions being exactly +15. The fifteenth fraction was neutral 
and the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth fractions were 3, 
- 35, and - 43.5. 

Fractional distillation of fireweed oil in the same manner gave 
for the first three fractions an oil which polarized 4, the next 
four fractions polarized from + 1 to + 5, the eighth fraction 2, 
the ninth was neutral, while the tenth to the fifteenth gave a plus 
polarization, the sixteenth 9, the seventeenth 53, and the 
eighteenth 85. The nineteenth and twentieth fractions were resin. 

Gildemeister and Hoffmann 1 give the polarization of erigeron oil 
as + 52. The author examined three samples from different manu- 
facturers and they gave the following figures upon polarization: 
+ 45, + 52.4, and + 55.3. 

Oil of fireweed and oil of turpentine appear to be the chief adulter- 
ants of erigeron oil. Oil of erigeron will form a clear solution with 
an equal volume of 94 per cent, alcohol (distinction from oil of fire- 
weed and oil of turpentine). U. S. P. 1900. 

Uses. Oil of erigeron is used in the treatment of hemorrhages and 
as a substitute for copaiba and cubeb in the treatment of venereal 
diseases.

1. An undetermined phenol, in very small amount. 

2. 1-Pinene, 1 

3. 1-Limonene, r in small amount. 

4. Dipentene, J 

5. l-Methyl-3-cyclohexanone, about 8 per cent.

7. 1-Menthone, 1 , 

o j TVT ji i about 50 per cent. 

8. d-iso-Menthone, J 

9. A sesquiterpene alcohol, about 2 per cent. 

10. An ester of salicylic acid, probably methyl salicylate. 

11. Esters of formic, acetic, octoic and decylic acids, together with 

ester of a dibasic acid of the probable formula, CsHuO^ 

12. Formic, butyric, octoic and decylic acids in the free state. 
All the above-mentioned esters and acids are present only in small 

amounts. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of pennyroyal is prepared by the dis- 
tillation of the fresh herb which yields from 10 to 12 pounds of oil 
per ton. The yield from the dry leaves is about 3 per cent, and from 
the dry stems 1.3 per cent, of the oil. 2 Hedeoma pulegioides yields 
10 to 12 pounds of oil per ton of the fresh herb. 

Kremers 3 states that oil of pennyroyal is prepared by the use of 
very crude apparatus and describes same as follows : 

The usual style of a "still" may be briefly described as a short trench in the ground, 
ending in a low flue or chimney. Over this trench is placed a closed wooden box, 
having a sheet-iron bottom and an auger-hole on top, through which water is poured. 
An ordinary barrel stands endwise on top of the steam-box, allowing steam to pass 
freely up through the barrel. A lute of clay is used to close the joint between the 
lower end of the barrel and the steam-box, as well as the cover of the barrel. Instead 
of a "worm" a tin pipe immersed in a trough of cold water is used, and a stem con- 
nection with the barrel is generally made by an elbow branch of wood bored out with 
an auger. The gathering of the herb is done by boys employed by the manu- 
facturer, who pays a stated price per 100 pounds of material ready for use. When the

Properties and Tests. Oil of pennyroyal is a pale yellow, limpid 
liquid, having a characteristic, pungent, mint-like odor and taste. 

Oil of turpentine appears to be the common adulterant of penny- 
royal oil and this would be detected by applying the solubility test 
in 70 per cent, alcohol.

OLEUM ORIGANI. 

Oil of Origanum. 

Essence d'Houblon d'Espagne, Fr. Spanisch Hopfenol, G. 

Origanum oil is produced from a number of species of Origanum 
growing in the Mediterranean countries. 

Gildemeister and Hoffmann l state that there are two varieties on 
the German market, which differ in properties and composition the 
Triest oil and the Smyrna oil. 

Oil of origanum was official in the 1850 edition of the United States 
Pharmacopoeia.

Principal Components. The Triest oil is chiefly composed of 
carvacrol, while the Smyrna oil contains carvacrol and smaller amounts 
of various substances. 

Preparation and Yield. Oil of origanum is prepared by steam 
distillation of the herb and the yield is from 2 to 3 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. The Triest oil is of a golden yellow color 
and has a thyme-like odor and a persistent taste. The Smyrna oil is 
lighter in color and has a milder taste. 

Turpentine, when used as an adulterant, would be detected by its 
non-solubility in 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Oil of origanum is assayed for carvacrol content by the method 
of determining phenols given under oil of thyme. 

Uses. Origanum oil is used in the preparation of liniments. It is 
a common practice to use oil of origanum when oil of thyme is called 
for, and vice versa.

70% alcohol precipitates the paraffin hydrocarbons of the oil, but forms a 
clear solution with its other constituents. 



406 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

Principal Components. Rose oil contains paraffin hydrocarbons, 
geraniol, monylic aldehyde, phenyl ethyl alcohol, citronellol, linalool 
and citral. 

Preparation and Yield. Siedler l states that in Bulgaria where 
considerable oil of rose is prepared, both the white and the red roses 
are used, but the white yields only about one-half as much oil as the 
red rose. The flowers when gathered are broken off immediately 
below the calyx and then distilled in copper stills. Siedler gives the 
yield as 1 kilo from 3000 kilos of roses, or 30 roses produce one drop 
of oil. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of rose is a pale yellowish, transparent 
liquid, having the strong, fragrant odor of rose, and a mild, slightly 
sweetish taste. 

It should have a saponification value not less than 10 nor more than 
17 when assayed according to the method given in the United States 
Pharmacopoeia VIII, which is as follows : 

Place in a weighing bottle about 2 cc. of the oil of rose and weigh it accurately. 
Transfer it, with the aid of a little alcohol, to a 100 cc. flask and add 20 cc. of half- 
normal alcoholic potassium hydroxide V. S. Connect the flask with a reflux con- 
denser and boil the mixture during thirty minutes on a water bath. When cool, 
add 50 cc. of distilled water and a few drops of phenolphthalein T. S. and titrate 
with half-normal sulphuric acid V. S. Subtract the number of cc. of half-normal 
sulphuric acid V. S. required, from 20 (the 20 cc. of half-normal alcoholic potassium 
hydroxide V. S. taken), multiply the difference by 27.87, and divide by the weight of 
the oil to obtain the saponification value. 

Gurjun balsam is used as an adulterant for oil of rose and may be 
detected by adding to 5 drops of the rose oil under examination, 10 cc. 
of glacial acetic acid and 3 drops of pure nitric acid, and shaking the 
mixture. If a reddish-violet color develops within thirty seconds it 
would indicate the presence of gurjun balsam. 

Palmarosa oil, spermaceti, and other substances generally accredited 
as being used as adulterants for rose oil would change the constants 
given for pure rose oil. 

Uses. Oil of rose is largely used in the manufacture of perfumes 
and rose water; however, the United States Pharmacopoeia directs 
that stronger rose water should be the saturated aqueous distillate 
prepared by distilling the fresh flowers of Rosa centifolia Linne (Fam. 
Rosaceae) with water.

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 v. 0.903 to 0.923 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C +40 to +60 

Soluble in about | volume or more of 90 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Agnew and Croad l obtained by distilla- 
tion the following: 

Resin from steam distillation 31.0 

First runnings 150 to 160 C 1.7 

Sabinene 162 to 166 C 16.0 

Terpinene fraction 175 to 185 C 5.3 

Sabinol 208 to 209 C 17.0 

Residue 210 C. upward 16.00 

Acids calculated from amount of sabinol 7.0 

Preparation and Yield. It is prepared by steam distillation of the 
fresh tops. The yield is from 3 to 5 per cent. 

Properties and Tests. Oil of savin is a colorless or yellowish liquid, 
having a peculiar terebinthinate odor, and a pungent, bitter and 
camphoraceous taste. 

Turpentine has been found to be the principal adulterant of savin oil. 

The oil being distilled mostly in France, the French turpentine is 
used as the adulterant which lowers the specific gravity and reduces 
the angle of rotation. 

Hamalainen 2 states that savin oil contains about 50 per cent, of 
sabinol acetate, which constitutes the toxic principle of the oil and 
this acetate on hydrolysis yields sabinol, which, in the body, combines 
in part with glycuronic acid and is excreted in the urine as sabinol- 
glycuronic acid. Sabinol-glycuronic acid may be identified by means 
of the characteristic crystalline salts it yields with certain bases, 
particularly with strychnine. The following method is described by 
Hamalainen for the detection of savin oil in cases of suspected poison- 
ing by this substance. The urine is treated with neutral lead acetate 
in neutral or feebly acid solution; the precipitate formed is separated 
by filtration and washed; after the filtrate has been rendered am- 
moniacal, basic lead acetate is added as long as a precpitate is produced. 
The basic lead salt is collected on a filter, washed with water, de-

408 PHARMACEUTICAL AND FOOD ANALYSIS. 

composed with cold 5 per cent, sulphuric acid solution, the lead 
sulphate separated and the solution neutralized with barium carbonate. 
After filtration, the filtrate is concentrated, preferably under reduced 
pressure, and the barium is precipitated by treating the warm solution 
with hot strychnine sulphate solution. The mixture is filtered while 
hot and the filtrate allowed to cool. Strychnine sabinol-glycuronate 
separates out in the form of brilliant needles which melt at 196 C. 
with decomposition. This salt has 2 molecules of water of crystalliza- 
tion; is fairly soluble in hot water, and but slightly soluble in cold 
water, alcohol, ether, acetone, chloroform, benzene, petroleum spirit, 
or ethyl acetate. On concentrating the mother liquor a strychnine 
salt with 3 molecules of water crystallizes out, melting at 193 C. It is 
more readily soluble than the first mentioned salt, and on cooling its 
solution rapidly, the salt with 2 molecules of water is obtained." 

Federal Notice of Judgment No. 2749 gives the following data in 
reference to an adulterated sample of oil of savin. 

Specific gravity at 25 C 0.9455 

Optical rotation in 100 mm. tube at 25 C 35.16 

Sabenyl acetate 28.78 

It conformed to the Pharmacopoeial (VIII) requirements as to solu- 
bility in 90 per cent, alcohol. 

Uses. Oil of savin is a uterine stimulant and is used as an em- 
menagogue.

OLEUM TANACETI. 
Oil of Tansy. 

Essence de Tanaisie, Fr. Rainfarnol, G. 

A volatile oil distilled from the fresh flowers and dry herb of 
Tanacetum vulgaris L. 

Tansy is indigenous and is also cultivated in most European coun- 
tries and the United States. 

CONSTANTS. 

Specific gravity at 25 C. (fresh herb) 0.925 to 0.940 

Specific gravity at 25 C. (dried herb) 0.955 

Optical rotation at 25 C +30 to +45 

Soluble in 3 volumes of 70 per cent, alcohol. 

Principal Components. Thujone and tanacetone. 



VOLATILE OR ESSENTIAL OILS. 409 

Preparation and Yield. Commercially, oil of tansy is obtained 
mostly from the United States. It is distilled from the fresh flowers 
(yielding 0.1 to 0.2 per cent.) and from the dry herb (yielding 0.2 to 
0.3 per cent.). 

Properties and Tests. Oil of tansy is a yellowish liquid, having the 
characteristic odor of tansy. 

It contains thujone, a ketone, which is separated by shaking the 
oil with an equal volume of sodium acid sulphite solution and two 
volumes of alcohol. A compound (CioHieO.NaHSOs) is formed. 
This substance, when treated with soda, yields thujone (CioHieO). 

Uses. The action of oil of tansy is similar to that of oil of savin, 
which also contains thujone. The oil is also used as an anthelmintic.
