THE TABLE. 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



THE pleasures of the table are enjoyed by all who possess good health. 
Nothing is more fascinating than to be seated at a well-served, well- 
cooked breakfast or dinner; and yet, of the immense number that 
enjoy the good cheer and luxuries of the table, how few, very few, 
there are who stop to consider the vexatious trouble our host undergoes 
when arranging the daily bill of fare. "Variety is the spice of life," 
but nowhere is it more important, aye, actually necessary, than in the 
getting up of a palatable meal. This pertains not only to the dining-room 
of a hotel of the least pretensions or to the so-called " grand " restaurant, 
but particularly to the family table. The writer has known a geptle- 
man who presided over an immense restaurant, and daily provided the 
supplies therefor. He experienced no difficulty with any single part of 
his business, yet when he came to arrange the details of his own family's 
meals, and attempted to practically fulfill them, he was puzzled and 
annoyed beyond description. And, after all, there is no place in the civil- 
ized world where the market for the supply of food is so well provided 
as in New York, both as to variety and excellence, and even as to luxu- 
ries. Educated as thousands of persons have been, in the art of dining, 
by the famous Delmonico and his able lieutenants. New York, perhaps, 
contains a larger number of so-called high-livers than any other city. 

These " gourmands" (if you please), and their number is legion, have, 
with the aid of the excellent resources of the American market and the 
encouragement given to the culinary art of the period, brought the modern 
American table to virtual perfection. This is saying a great deal, inas- 
much as the famed restaurants of London, Paris, and Vienna have ever 
claimed a reputation and an ascendancy over others that seemed to form 
a part of history itself. 

But as times change, so we change with them. Westward the course 
of Empire sways, and the great glory of the past has departed from those 



\ 

THE TABLE. 



centres where the culinary art at one time defied all rivals. The sceptre 
of supremacy has passed into the hands of the great metropolis of the 
New World. It has been the writer's good fortune to gain experience on 
this subject from his observations in Europe as well as in this country. 
He can state, without fear of contradiction, that more first-class, well-fatted^ 
'and corn-fed cattle reach the markets of New York; than any other market 
of the United States. Whenever a firstrclass article of beef is required by 
one of the inland hotels, they send to New York for it. 

Ask the ordinary traveler, and he will tell you that a first-class steak; 
an "A I" chop, or prime roast beef is a, rara avis in hotels outside 
of New York. London has excellent mutton and good beef; that is all. 
Paris gives plenty of variety, but it is all of an inferior quality with the 
exception of veal, which is good. The same may be said of northern 
Germany, where, in addition,^the larger hotels in Hamburg and Bremen 
are able to supply good steaks, the cattle in that country being of fine 
quality. 

Yet no American^ accustomed to his prime beef at New York, can be 
pleased at any of these continental hotels, as he loses sight of his favorite 
roast and steak. * 

At the extensive cattle yards of Berlin, which 'are under control of an 
excellent administration, and , perfectly arranged, it was impossible, for 
instance, on a well-supplied market day to find a single dozen corn-fed 
young steers that would make good enough beef for first-class custom in 
New York. , The bulk of cattle offered for sale was made up of oxen 
that had been overworked — they had horns bigger than themselves — and 
the remainder were old cows and bulls. 

Of the bovine family, the branch most celebrated for the good quality 
of beef is the Durhams or Shorthorns. It is only fifty years ago that 
the first were imported to this c-Ountry from' England, and so well h^ve 
they prospered and multiplied that the finest and best specimens of the 
race are now found in these United States. They are now freely exported , 
at large prices, to the mother-co.untry, where they are highly prized for 
breeding purposes. There are farms in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, 
and even in Missourj and Kansas, that turn out annually from 300 to 1,000 
head of fatted, corn-fed cattle, from two to four years old, and weighing 
from 1,500 to 2,500 pounds per head. 

As to mutton, this country is already beginning to occupy a position 
second to none. We may probably not as yet surpass England in this 
respect, butvwe have learned a great deal on this subject during the past 
thirty years; hence the American breed of sheep has considerably 
improved. The quality and flavor of our mutton is improving to that 
extent that a long time cannot possibly elapse before the prejudice now 
existing in favor of the English article must give way to the honest 
acknowledgment that the American mutton, if not superior to, stands at 
least fully on a par with, the English rival. 

Our farmers and agriculturists have learned a great deal on this ques- 
tion. They now know that, as to early lambs, for instance, the ewes 



THE PLEASURES OF THE TABLE. 



should be strong, and kept in good condition, so that they can supply the 
lambs with plenty of milk. They are now kept in a warm barn where the 
cold winds do not touch them, and where the sun can shine on them. 
They commence feeding them by putting a little bran in the lamb's mouth, 
so that it can taste it, and the lambs commence eating from a box 
separate from the sheep. They generally feed them with cracked corn or 
meal, and sometimes oats and corn ground together, with plenty of milk 
from the ewes. If kept in good order and well fed, they will be ready 
for market by the time they are six to eight weeks old. After the month 
of June, lambs come from New York State — mostly from Dutchess County. 
They are turned out to graze on the hills, where some cracked corn and 
meal are put in the fields, so they can eat it at their pleasure. Many of 
the late sheep and lambs come from Canada. Two of the largest sheep 
ever sold in New York were raised by Mr. Vail, of Dutchess County, and 
sold by A. Luyster to Mr. L. Delmonico for the sum of fioo. The 
two weighed, alive, 632 lbs., and dressed, 420 lbs. 

One of the leading questions that directly affects the American cuisine 
is the contest now progressing as to the transportation of animal food to 
the great Eastern markets. Heretofore live cattle were transported to, 
and slaughtered at, the places of consumption. This so - called home- 
slaughtering interest has within the past few years experienced great 
competition with the slaughterers of cattle in the far West, who have 
brought their meats to the Eastern market in refrigerator-cars. The 
great question now is: Which is the better way, and by which method are 
the public interests served the best, as well as the sanitary condition of 
this important article of food most improved ? 

There can be no doubt that, while this controversy lasts, the consumer 
has already been benefited, and the transportation of live cattle has already 
been greatly facilitated and improved. The quality of the meat does not 
depend upon the place where the animal is slaughtered, but it does depend 
upon the sta'e of the animal's health when it is slaughtered. Let the 
cattle-cars be improved so that cattle can be transported without being 
knocked about and bruised, and let them be properly fed and watered 
while in transit; after making the long journey from the far West, let 
them be well rested and cooled off before slaughtering. 

The Western dressed-beef men will also have to be on their mettle in 
order to meet the exigencies of the times. Let them keep their wild 
prairie cattle and their scalawags out of the better markets, handle their 
beef carefully, keep it subjected to a uniform temperature of about 38*^ 
Fahrenheit, discard all artificial preservative means, and all opponents to 
their interests will be bereft of argument.

THE TABLE. 



OUR MARKETS. 



OUR markets contain an abundant supply of poultry and game of an 
exceptionally fine quality. For superior and palatable chickens 
we are recommended to those raised about the creameries of New 
Jersey. The hand-fed ^eese and ducks of Rhode Island rival in flavor 
and delicacy the celebrated Caneton-de-Rouen, while the American tur- 
keys are famous the world over. To give any adequate idea of the quan- 
tity of game which comes from the vast feeding-grounds of this country, 
or to enumerate substantially eVery form in which, during the different 
seasons, game appears in market, would require too much space. 

No game is more highly prized or more eagerly sought after in Europe 
than our American canvas-back ducks, grouse and wild turkeys. It has 
become part of our history that during the late war twenty thousand 
turkeys ^were shipped by one firm in New York City to supply a Thanks- 
giving dinner to an army ; while at present so plentiful is the supply that 
but a few days would be required to secure double that number. 

Near Rhode Island, on one farm of about fifty acres, twenty thou- 
sand geese, and as many ducks, are fattened annually for market. In 
Vermont and other cold localities during December, when turkeys are 
full grown and fattest, hundreds of tons of them are dressed, frozen hard 
in boxes, and preserved in that condition for use in the spring and sum- 
mer months; when freshly killed, turkeys are tough and unpalatable. 
Unless well experienced, the purchaser would do better to leave the 
selection of poultry and game to some reliable dealer, rather than depend 
upon " signs,'' which are at times deceiving. 

Spring chickens appear in market about May ; those hatched in incu- 
bators come somewhat earlier. They are very small, weighing about a 
pound each, and improve in flavor and richness as they increase in size. 
Tender chickens may be had almost the whole year, but they are not 
plentiful during the spring months. 

Capons are good from December until April. 

Young turkeys are first killed in September ; they are full grown and 
fattest in December, and remain good until spring, when they are super- 
seded by frozen turkeys. 

Geese and ducks are first brought to market in June, and, if they have 
been properly fed, are a great delicacy. They may be had through the 
summer, autumn, and winter months. Geese are called "green" until 
they are three or four months old. 

Guinea-fowls are best in summer and autumn, when young and fat. 

Squabs are in market the whole year. 



OUR MARKETS. 



The laws for killing and selling game vary somewhat in the different 
States, and sometimes in the different counties of the same State. Refer- 
ence is made principally in regard to the New York City markets. So 
great are the facilities for forwarding quickly by rail and steamer, that 
supplies of game are easily obtained from long distances ; and birds killed 
in southern Texas, or other remote places, may be served perfectly fresh 
on New York tables a few days later. The flight of birds is greatly 
controlled' by the weather. An early or late season, or a wet or dry one, 
or even a cold wave, may hasten or retard them, and make ga,me plentiful 
or scarce, fat or poor ; but an abundant supply of all kinds of game in its 
best condition is generally to be had in the months it is in season, as 
follows : 

Ruffed grouse, commonly called partridges, are in season from Sep- 
tember I to February i. 

Pinnated grouse, commonly called prairie-chickens, from September 
I to February i. 

Quails, from November i to February i. 

Woodcock are in the market from August r to February i, and .are 
fattest in October. 

English snipe appear in the spring, and again in the autumn, when they 
are in their best condition, and are to be had in smaller quantities during 
the winter. 

Yellow-legged snipe, robin or red-breasted snipe, dowicher and black- 
breasted or winter snipe, also common snipe, are abundant in the spring, 
and again from July through October, when they are best. 

Upland, grass, or gray plover are in market through the spring and 
summer months, and are fattest in August and September. 

Doe-birds are to be had at about the same time. They are plover of a 
larger size, and are considered not inferior to any other. 

Golden plover, or frost-birds, are plentiful in the spring, and are in fine 
condition in September and October. 

Sora, or Virginia rail, are best in .September and October. 

Reed-birds, or rice-birds, become very fat in August and September. 
When found among the reeds of New Jersey they are called reed-birds, 
and rice-birds when from the wild rice-fields of the, South. 

Rabbits and hares are in season from November i to February i. 

Venison is in market from August i to January i only, and is good 
during that time. 

Antelope may be generally had through the autumn and winter 
months. 

Wild pigeons appear in the spring and autumn, but no longer in such 
immense numbers as formerly. It is only possible to obtain them for 
market when their " nestings " are near a railroad, which facilitates their 
quick shipment. The young birds (wild squabs), taken from the nest, 
make a most delicious broil. 

Wild ducks, swan, geese, and brant are in season from September i 
to May I, The choicest of these are : canvas-back, mallard, teal, red-

head, widgeon, wood, brant, cygnet or young swan, goose when young 
and fat. 

English pheasants, English hares, and Scotch grouse are to be found 
in the New York markets in excellent condition during the winter months. 

The wild mongrel goose, which appears in our markets about Christ- 
mas-time, is, like the canvas-back duck, considered as one of the greatest 
luxuries, and exclusively American. 

The far-famed canvas-back duck is also an exclusively North American 
species. Closely resetabling in appearance and habits the red-head of 
America and the pochard of Europe, it is still quite distinct from and 
superior to both these species in the excellence of its flesh. It is found 
throughout North America, from the Arctic Ocean to Central America, on 
the interior waters and on both shores. Chesapeake Bay is the most 
noted ground for canvas-back ducks in the country, but they are espe- 
cially abundant in Southern California. They breed on the ponds, rivers, 
and lakes, from Oregon to the more extreme northern portions of the con- 
tinent. The canvas-back is without doubt the most sought , after and 
-widely known of all our ducks, and in localities where it can obtain the 
root of the Vallisneria spiralis (called by some tape-grass, and by others, 
incorrectly, wild celery), the food to which it owes the peculiarly delicate 
flavor for which it is so famous. As a highly prized delicacy, it stands 
without a rival. When, however, it is obliged to content itself with a diet 
chiefly of animal food, or is not properly handled in the kitchen, it becomes 
merely a very ordinary table bird. The Vallisneria is not found on the 
Pacific Coast, but in many parts of the interior, and especially in the 
Chesapeake Bay. The canvas-back being an excellent and strong diver, 
brings from the bottom the Vallisneria by the roots ; these it bites off and 
swallows,while the red-head, black-head, and other ducks feed on the refuse 
grass, or occasionally a root snatched from the canvas-back. At times 
the water is covered with grass thus pulled up. By the middle of Decem- 
ber the canvas-back becomes so fat as- to have been known to burst open 
in the breast in falling on the water. In New Orleans it is called " canard 
cheval." The canvas-back is covered somewhat like the red-head, but 
there is no reason for the confusion which exists in the minds of so many 
people regarding the two species. A careful comparison of the following 
descriptions of the two birds will indicate well-marked differences by 
which they may always be distinguished. The cook of a Buffalo gentle- 
man, when asked if she knew the difference between a r,ed-head and a 
canvas-back replied, "To be sure! one has the head of a fool!" (meaning 
the canvas-back). 

CANVAS-BACK. RED-HEAD. 

Feathers of the head short and Feathers of the head rather 
smooth. Male with head and neck long, giving it a puffy appearance, 
of deep chestnut color, the former Male with head and neck chest- 
sometimes quite blackish. Fore nut red. Fore parts of body,

Iris yellow. 

The weight of a. pair of good 
fat red-head ducks with feathers 
on will average five pounds. 

The red-head duck is found in greater or less numbers throughout 
North America, on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, breeding in high north- 
ern latitudes, and frequenting in winter the southern portions of the con- 
tinent as far as Mexico. The red-head is not common on the coasts of 
New England. During the winter months it abounds considerably along 
the south shore of Long Island, and is extremely abundant from this 
point south, especially at Chesapeake Bay and Currituck. Its flesh is 
excellent, and when it is enabled to feed on the well-known Vallisneria is 
almost fully equal in point of flavor to that of the canvas-back. The diet 
of the red-head is by preference vegetable, but in default of a sufficiency 
of food of this nature, they will, like other ducks, eat frogs, tadpoles, and 
various moUusks. In the West they feed largely on corn and wheat, 
which they glean from the fields, and on wild oats, the seed of the water- 
lily, and roots and leaves of other aquatic plants. 



THE TABLE. 



VARIETIES OF FISH TO BE FOUND IN 

THE MARKETS DURING THE 

DIFFERENT MONTHS. 



JANUARY. 



Live codfish \Gadus morrhud\. Haddock \Melamogramus agle finus\. 
Cusk [Brosmius brosme] ; this belongs to the cod family, and although 
very little known, is an excellent table fish. Hake [Phycis chuss\ ; this is 
another of the codfish family, but inferior to any. of the other varieties. 
Halibut [Hypoglossus vulgatis\. Small chicken halibut {Hypoglossus vul- 
garis]. Striped bass [Jioccus lineaius]. Eels [Arguilla vulgaris]. Lobsters 
[Ilomarus Americanus]; very scarce, and in poor condition. Fresh salmon 
[Oncorhynchus chouicka\ ; these salmon are caught in the Columbia River, 
Oregon, all the year round, and are shipped in refrigerator-cars, and 
received daily in the New York markets. Frozen salmon [Salmo salar]; 
caught in the Restigouche River in July, and kept in freezers. Turb9t 
\Platysomatichthys hippoglossoides], coming from Newfoundland, are occa- 
sionally in market during this month. Frost-fish, sometimes called tom- 
cods [Microgdus tomcod\. Frozen fresh mackerel \Scomber scombrus\. 
Frozen Spanish-mackerel [Scomber omarus\. Pompano \Trachynotus caro- 
linus\ ; a. iew occasionally in market, coming from Pensacola, Florida. 
Red-fish, or channel bass [Sciasna ocellata]. Caught in Florida. Sheep's-head 
\Diplodus pobatocephalus\, from Florida. Grouper \Epinephelus morio\, 
from Pensacola ; a very good fish for boiling, somewhat like the red- 
snapper, but the meat is of a finer grain. Red-snapper [Lutjanus Black- 
fordii] has become a staple article in our markets during the wintfer. 
They weigh from two pounds upward, as much as twenty pounds each. 
It is good either boiled or baked, but most epicures prefer it baked. In 
selecting a fish, care should be taken not to buy one that weighs over eight 
pounds, as anything larger than that is apt to be tough and lacking in 
flavor. Shad [Clupea sopidisima\, caught in the St. John's River, in Florida, 
are to be had nearly every day during this month. Frozen bluefish 
[Pomatomus saltatrix], preserved by being kept in freezers since the pre- 
vious fall. Herring \Clupea karengus], from Nova Scotia. Skate, or ray- 
f&sh ^Plerroplatea maclura]. The demand for this fish increases every year. 
The American people begin to appreciate its many excellences. Probably 
the annual dinners of the Ichthyophagous Club, at which this fish is 
always served, have materially increased the popularity and demand for 
this fish. Rainbow trout [Salmo irridea\ These fish were first marketed 
during the winter of 1885 and 1886, and they are one of the notable exam- 



VARIETIES OF FISH. 



pies of fish-culture, as the following brief history will show. Six years 
ago Professor Spencer F. Baird, then Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries 
for the United States, received a lot of eggs of the rainbow trout from 
California. He presented five hundred of them to the South Side Club, 
who have one of the most complete fish-cultural, establishments in this 
State. These eggs were hatched and the fish raised in the preserves of 
the Club, where they increased to. such an extent that the Club decided to 
send their surplus to market, and they have become very popular, and 
sell readily at one dollar and twenty-five cents per pound. The open 
season for these trout is from April to September. Salmon-trout, frozen 
\Salvelinus namaycus/i\. Whitefish, frozen [Coregonus clupeiformis]. Pick- 
erel [Esox reiiculatus], weighing from half a pound to ten pounds each, 
are very aaad during the winter months. Wall-eyed pike [SiicosUdium 
vitreutri]. Catfish \^Ietalurus punctatus\. Smelts \Osmerus mordax\ are 
received from different parts of the East and North during this month. 
The choicest come from Maine and Massachusetts. Those coming from 
Canada are always frozen, and are inferior, and sold at a very low price. 
Green turtle. Diamond-back terrapin. Prawns, from South Carolina. 
Scallops. Oysters. The following are the best in this month : Blue 
Points, Shrewsburys, East Rivers, and Mill Ponds. Hard crabs. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Whitebait. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. 
Smoked halibut. Best boneless dried codfish. 

FEBRUARY. 

Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Eels. Live lob- 
sters. Fresh salmon. Frost-fish. Fresh Spanish-maekerel are found 
occasionally in market, coming from Pensacola, Florida. Pompano. 
Sheep's-head. Red-fish, or channel bass. Grouper. Red-snapper. White 
perch \Roccus Americanus], from Long Island ; one of the best pan-fish 
that is found in market. Smelts, green, from Maine, Massachusetts, and 
Rhode Island, and frozen smelts from Canada. During the latter part of 
the month very choice smelts are received from Long Island. These fish 
are large, and are considered the best of all varieties of smelts received. 
Shad. During the latter part of the month they begin to come from North 
Carolina. These fish are oftentimes large^ weighing six pounds each, and 
in flavor are equal to those taken in the Connecticut River. Herring. 
Skate, or ray-fish. Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Yellow perch [Ferca Amer- 
icana]. Pickerel. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish. Green turtle. Terrapin. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Codfish tongues. Soft shell crabs during 
this month are in excellent qondition, and are considered one of the most 
Seasonable shell fish in market at this time. Hard crabs. Whitebait. 
Crab-meat, fresh picked. Finnan haddie. Smoked salmon. Boneless 
dried codfish. Smoked halibut. 

MARCH. 
Live codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken Halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Salmon, from the Columbia River. During the 



lO THE TABLE. 



latter part of the month a few fish are received from Nova Scotia, weigh- 
ing about eight pounds each, and are called Kennebec salmon by the 
tradesmen, although no salmon are caught either in the Penobscot or 
Kennebec rivers, Maine, until about the ist of May. Large flounders 
\JPseudoplnironectes Amertcanus\, suitable for making fillet of sole. Spanish- 
mackerel. .Pompano. Sheep's-head. Red-snapper. Grouper. Shad are 
abundant this month from North Carolina, and about the 25th or 30th oi 
March they make their first appearance in the North or Hudson River. 
Herring. Skate, or ray-fish. Sturgeon \Acipencer sturi6\. Salmon-trout. 
"Whitefish. Yellow perch. Pickerel. C\sco\Coregonus artedi\. Catfish. Wall- 
eyed pike. Green turtle. Terrapin. With the month of March closes the 
terrapin season, as after the ist of April it seems to be uhiverally con- 
ceded that the weather is too warm, and terrapin are not relished, not 
does the palate crave them. Soft shell clams are still excellent this month. 
Prawns. Scallops. Oysters. Those known as East Rivers, caught on 
the north shore of Long Island, are considered best in this month. Crab- 
meat, fresh picked. Smoked haddock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 
Smoked mackerel. 

APRIL. 

Liye codfish. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Chicken halibut. 
Eels. Live lobsters. Tomcods. Salmon, fresh from the Columbia River. 
Salmon, fresh from Nova Scotia. Flounders. White perch. Fresh mack- 
erel. About the first part of April mackerel make their appearance on 
our coast, oftentimes in enormous numbers, and are sold in the markets 
at prices so low as to make them the cheapest food of the season. Span- 
ish-mackerel and pompano are occasionally in the market from Pensacola, 
Florida. Kingfish \Menticirrus nebulosu5\ ; a few come into market from 
North Carolina. Sheep's-head, from North Carolina. Smelts ; with the 
close of this month the fish goes out of season. Red-snapper are to be 
found in market up to the 15th of April. Sea bass \Serranus atrarius] ; 
a few occasionally come into market from Charleston, S. C. Shad increase 
in abundance from the North and Hudson rivers. Skate, or ray-fish. 
Bluefish [Pomatomus saltatrix] ; a few make their appearance, caught on 
the Florida coast. Brook-trout [Salvelinus fontinalis]. The open season 
for this fish commences April i. Salmon-trout. Whitefish. Pickerel. 
Cisco. Wall-eyed pike. Catfish. Green turtle. Prawns. Crayfish [As- 
tacus Jluviatilus] are found during this month in the markets ; they are 
caught in the Potomac River. Scallops ; with the close of this month 
they are out of season. Oysters are generally better during the month of 
April than at any other time of the year, but, according to custom, with 
the close of this month the oyster season ends. Fresh frogs' legs during 
the latter part of this month are taken, and begin to make their appear- 
ance in market at prices of about sixty to seventy-five cents per pound. 
Codfish tongues. Hard crabs. Crab-meat. Whitebait. Smoked had- 
dock. Smoked salmon. Smoked halibut. 



VARIETIES OF FISH. \ \ 



MAY. 

Codfish during this month is apt to be poor, as no live fish are 
brought to the New York markets. It is mostly fish caught off Nan- 
tucket and repacked in Boston, and from there shipped to New York. 
Haddock ; the same applies to this fish as to the cod. Halibut is 
in excellent condition this month, both large fish for steaks, and small 
chicken halibut for dinner fish. Striped bass. Eels. Lobsters. Black- 
fish \Teutogo onitts]. Salmon from Restigouche make their appear- 
ance about the 20th of May. Oregon salmon continue to come during 
this month, although not in as good order as in previous months. 
Large flounders for fillet of sole are excellent this month. Fresh mack- 
erel. Spanish-mackerel and pompano from Pensacola, Florid*. A few 
come to market from North Carolina during this month. Butter-fish 
[Stromateus triacanthus\ make their appearance in the market this month. 
Weakfish \Cyonoscion regale] plenty and cheap. Kingfish from Long 
Island make their appearance during this month in the markets, and are 
an excellent fish, growing better each month till October, when they go 
out of season. Sheep's-head ; a few make their appearace from Long 
Island. Porgies [Stenotomus chrysops], from Long Island. Sea bass during 
this month are abundant from Narragansett Bay. Shad from Connecticut 
is probably at its best this month. There is no doubt that shad from 
this river possesses a flavor superior to all others. Shad from the North 
River begin to get soft and are not in good condition. Bluefish; there are a 
few weighing one and a half to two pounds each in market. Squid [Loiigo 
pealcet] This is an article of food that Spaniards and Italians think a great 
deal of, but it is very little used by American people as yet. It has been 
introduced to the American public by the dinners of the Ichthyophagous 
Club, which is composed of a few gentlemen connected with the leading 
newspapers, and some eminent scientific men, whose object is to cultivate 
a taste and demand for those varieties of fish which are not generally sup- 
posed to be good edible food. Brook-trout under the existing law come 
into market on April i. Probably the finest flavored trout found on 
this continent are the wild brook-trout taken in the streams of Long 
Island. Cultivated brook-trout that are raised in ponds and preserves 
depend very much upon the character of their food as to what the flavor 
will be. Trout that are fed entirely upon chopped liver are usually flat 
and insipid to the taste. But trout that are fed upon small minnows or 
other fish-food, such as clams, larvae of insects, and small fish of any 
kind, are always more delicate in flavor. Salmon-trout and whitefish ; a 
few are found in market this month, but during warm weather it is very 
difficult to obtain them in New York City markets in prime condition. 
Carp [Cyprinus carpia\. These fish are now making their appearance in 
our markets in considerable quantities, having been introduced into this 
country through the instrumentality of Professor Spencer F. Baird, late 
United States Fish and Fisheries Commissioner, some eight years ago. 



12 THE TABLE. 



They have been distributetj in nearly every State of the Union, and in the 
Southern States have grown larger, and are found in better condition, than 
they are in Germany, where the parent fish came irom. The market is 
principally supplied now with fish caught in the Potomac River, weighing 
from two to fifteen pounds each, and are selling at present for twenty-five 
cents a pound ; but in the course of a few years there is no doubt that 
these fish will be sold for from ten to twelve cents a pound. Green turtle. 
Frogs' legs. Crayfish during this month come from Wisconsin. They 
are of very fine flavor, and are the best that are found in this. country. 
Prawns from South Carolina. Crab-meat, fresh picked. Soft crabs grow 
more abundant during this month, and are in excellent condition. A very 
choice smoked fish is in season this month, called the roe herring, and by 
some of the grocers undei: various names, such as bloatprs, Burlington 
herring, etc. 

JUNE. 

Codfish may be had, but ijot in good condition. Haddock may be had, 
but not in good condition. Halibut. Striped Bass. Eels. Lobsters. 
Fresh salmon from the Kennebec and Penobscot rivers, Maine, and from 
the Restigouche and other rivers in Canada, are very abundant this 
month, and are to be had at the lowest price during the season, selling 
oftentimes as low as fifteen cents per pound by the whole fish.' Large 
flounders for fillet of sole. Blackfish.. Fresh mackerel. Pompano. Span- 
ish-mackerel. Weakfish. Butter-fish. Kingfish. Sheep's-head. Porgies. 
Sea bass. Sturgeon. Shad from the Connecticut River are still in good 
condition, but with the close of this month go out of season. Bluefish are 
larger, sometimes weighing four to six pounds each, and are improving in 
quality. Carp. Skate, or ray-fish. Black bass \Micropterus dolomiei\ are 
in season from the ist of June until the ist of January. This is a very 
choice table fish; probably one of the best of the fresh water fishes. 
Crayfish. Frogs' legs. Soft crabs. Crab-meat. Whitebait..

VARIETIES OF FISH. I 3 

a very inferior fish as compared with the Spanish-mackerel. Crevalle 
\Caranx hippos]. This fish is sometimes sold as pompano, but is a very 
inferior fish, as the pompano is one of the choicest fishes that we have in 
market. Butter-fish, Tilefish \Lopholatilus chatnaeleonticeps\. This fish 
was first discovered in our waters by the United States Fish Commission 
in 1880. It is very brilliant in color, but the meat is very coarse-flaked, 
and somewhat resembling the haddock in appearance and flavor. Lafa- 
yette \Liostomus xanthurus], a small fish weighing about a quarter of a 
pound each, and a very desirable pan-fish. Sea-robins [Prionotus palmipes\. 
This fish is found very plentifully at this season of the year in the waters 
of Long Island, and was first introduced as a table fish by the Ichthyo- 
phagous Club some five years ago. It is a vcjry fair pan-fish. Sea bass. 
Kingfish. Sheep's-head. Porgies. Bluefish. Moonfish. Squid. Skate.

in price, and with the close of the month fresh salmon caught on the 
Atlantic coast go out of season. Large flounders for fillet of sole. Black- 
fish. Fresh mackerel. Spanish-mackerel. During this month the Spanish- 
mackerel are in their best condition, being fat and of delicate flavor. Cero

Weakfish. Lafayette. Porgies. Squid. Smelts make their appearance 
for the first time in the season during this month. Red-snapper are to be 
found in market this month, the first of the season. Grouper ; a fish 
somewhat resembling the red-snapper in form, but of a darl^er red color, 
and similar in flavor to the red-snapper, and by a great many peopir 
thought to be superior to the red-snapper. Sea bass. Skate. Bluefish 
are in better condition, and in their prime during this month. Salmon- 
trout. Pickerel. Whitefish. Catfish. Wall-eyed pike. Carp. Green 
turtle. Crayfish. Prawns. Frogs' legs. Scallops begin to come into market 
at this time, but are not quite so good as they are a month later. Hard 
crabs. Whitebait. Soft crabs are in better condition and of better flavor 
during this month than at any other time of the year. Moonfish. Butter-

OCTOBER. 

Codfish ; during the latter part of this month codfish are brought alive 
to the market. Haddock. Halibut. Striped bass. Eels. Lobsters. 
Blackfish. Columbia River salmon commence to come into market at this 
time. These salmon are what are known as the steel-head variety [Salmo 
gardneri\. They are not as fine flavored nor as much esteemed as t'nose 
that are called chinooks, which come earlier in the season. Large

are not considered good for the table until the weather is cold, and with 
the month of October are first used on the table. Crayfish. Prawns. 
Frogs' legs. Hard crabs. Soft crabs are to be found in market usually 
up to the loth of October. White-bait. Scallops. Redfish, or spotted

the past two or three years, during the month of November, shad have 
been taken off the coast of Massachusetts in the nets along with the mack- 
erel. These shad are large,' weighing five pounds each, and are very fat 
and of excellent flavor. Bluefish. This month usually closes the bluefish 
season, but during the months of December, January, and February they 
are found in market, but always are fish that have been preserved by 
freezing. Masquallonge \_Esox nobilier\. This fish weighs from four to 
twenty pounds each, and is of the pickerel family, and considered the

brown color ; not equal in flavor to the soft crab found during the 
summer. 



VEGETABLES. 



15 



VEGETABLES. 



VEGETABLES are grown to such an extent in the South, and also in 
hot-houses in the North, that we may enjoy, even in the coldest 
winter weather, nearly every variety. 

The growing oi vegetables in the South for Northern markets received 
its impetus through an incident which happened in a then well-known 
resort in New York. A party of gentlemen, among them a, steward on 
one of the Southern steamers, were seated one day in January con- 
versing, when the steward, who was in the habit of bringing mint with him 
for this particular resort, ordered a mint-julep; this order, at that time of 
the year, created a little surprise, especially to one of the party, who was 
a dealer in vegetables. However, the matter was explained, and the 
dealer arranged with the steward to bring him some mint, together with 
whatever vegetables he could get, on iach of his Northern trips. The 
demand for them increased so fast that a great many growers commenced 
to raise vegetables, so that the business has grown to vast proportions. 

The following information may be useful to those who wish to know 
at what season of the year certain vegetables may be had, and also where 
they may be had in their prime. 

Asparagus. The consumption of asparagus has grown so much dur- 
ing the past few years, partly, perhaps, through the recommendation of 
physicians, that it might be well here to gjve an idea as to where and 
when it is grown. It first makes its appearance in market from the 
middle of February until the middle of March, according to the condition 
of the weather. 

Occasionally it may be had during the winter from hot-houses, but of 
inferior quality. The first of out-door growth comes from Charleston, 
S. C, where there are a number of very large beds, and where it is grown 
very successfully, both as to quality and quantity. It is shipped from 
there to Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and N^ew York, arriving at 
the latter place by express in a little leSs than forty-eight hours after 
cutting. Although North Carolina is growing more every year, the next 
location where it is raised in quantities for market is Norfolk, Va. , the quality 
being of the best. We now reach our own vicinity — Oyster Bay and New 
Jersey. The former place has long had the reputation of raising the finest 
asparagus, but as a great many of their beds are getting old, and not 
receiving the proper attention, they are fast losing their prestige to 
Jersey, where they are growing more and more every year, and of the 
very finest quality. Asparagus may be had at its best from the ist of 
May, until the ist of June; after this time it comraeices to run out until 
July first, when cutting is stopped. The demand h^s been so great for 



1 6 THE TA'BLE. 



the past few years that, although more and more is raised every year, the 
price advances instead of getting less, and for the large "Colossal" or 
" Delmonico " asparagus immense prices are paid. 

French artichokes may be had all the year round; the quality and 
size depend on the condition of the weather during their growth. Most 
of the supply is from France, but occasionally from California and the 
South. 

Jerusalem artichokes appear from the ist of October until June ; they 
are always good. 

String beans can be had from the middle of February until December; 
' they are in their prime during the Spring and fall months. Occasionally 
we receive them in December and January from Havana, burt they are not 
first-class. 

Lima beans, which are seldom shipped from the South, can be had 
from August until frost sets in; they are always good. 

Beets all the year round ; best in spritag and summer. • 

Cabbage all the year round; always good. The first new cabbage 
comes from Florida in March. During the winter large quantities of 
cabbages are imported from Denmark. 

Carrots all the year; the small young ones appearing in the spring. 

Chives can be had all the year round. 

Cucumbers all the year round. In the winter we get them from the 
hot-houses around Boston; they are of the very finest quality, although 
rather expensive. \ 

Cauliflower all the year round; we have them in January, February, 
and March from England and France, and in April and May from the hot- 
houses on Long Island. They are of fine quality at. all seasons except 
during summer. 

Celery may be had in every month but May and June, but is best 
during the cold weather. It is being extensively raised in Kalamazoo, 
Mich., for the past three or four years; and as they raise it much earlier 
than we, and of good quality, it will not be long before we have it all 
the year round. 

Chervil may be had all the year round, but is usually poor during 
warm weather. 

Chicory we have from August until March; best during fall and winter 
months; occasionally during February and March; a fine quality comes 
from France. 

Corn or winter salad (called by the French doucette, and by the Germans 
fetticux) from September until warm weather sets in. It is purely, as its 
name indicates, a winter salad, as it never grows in the summer. 

Cress all the year round; best in the spring. 

Dandelion from January i to June. 

Escarolle salad from August until March. 

Egg-plant all the year round ; scarce during winter. 

Garlic all the year round; in large quantities for the past two or three 
years during May, June, and July, from New Orleans. 



VEGETABLES. 1 7 

Herbs, such as thyme, sage, sweet basil, borage, dill, lavender, 
sweet-fennel, sweet-marjoram, rosemary, summer-savory, tansy, etc., 
may be had green in the summer and fall, and dry during the balance 
of the year. 

Kohl-rabi from May until November. 

Knot celery from September until May. 

Leeks all the year round. 

Lettuce can be had all the year round. In the winter it comes from 
the hot-houses of Boston, Providence, Long Island, and Jersey, but princi- 
pally from Providence, as that city for the past few years has made a 
business of growing lettuce for the New York market. It is best in the 
fall and spring.' It is almost impossible to grow good lettuce in the 
summer, for, should it head at all, the warm weather would rot it. 

Mint can be had nearly all the year round ; scarce during December 
and January. 

Mushrooms can be had all the year round; they are raised principally 
in cellars and hot-houses on Long Island, and the demand for them 
increases yearly. The people are gradually getting over the fear they 
once had of the poisonous toad-stools, of which, by the way, there is no 
danger now, as the mushrooms are carefully picked and sent to market 
by men who understand the business. They are scarce during the very 
warm weather. , 

Oyster-plant can be had from September until June. 

Okra appears all the year round; in the winter and spring it comes 
from Havana. 

Parsley all the year round. 

Onions may be had all the year round. 

Green peppers all the year round. In winter we get them from 
Havana. 

Potatoes all the year round. There need be but little fear of a potato- 
famine. During the past few years, when our own crop has been light, 
large quantities were imported from England, Ireland, Scotland, and 
Germany. The first new potatoes come from Bermuda about April i. 

Sweet potatoes from August until June. 

Peas from March until November. 

Parsnips from September until June. , 

Pumpkins from September until February. 

Romaine salad can be had in the spring and fall. 

Radishes all the year round; they are very scarce in hot weather. 

Rhubarb from February until July. 

Brussels-sprouts from October until April. We import the very 
finest from France during March and April, but our growers are improv- 
ing in raising them from year to year, and we hope before long to rival the 
French. 

Kale-sprouts from November until June. 

Shallots all the year round. They are green in spring and summer 
and can be had dry during winter. 
2 



1 8 THE TABLE. 



Spinach all the year round; it is covered up in the early lyinter to 
keep it from freezing, but occasionally during extreme cold weather the 
cold reaches it, when it is impossible to cut it, which makes it scarce and 
high in the markets. 

Sorrel can be had all the year round; it is raised mostly by French 
gardeners. 

White and yellow summer-squash from April until October. 

Marrow-squash all the year round, except May and part of June; 
they are used quite generally to make pies instead of pumpkins. 

Tomatoes can be had all the year round, except December and part 
of January. The first new ones come from Key West; they are oi 
excellent quality. 

White and ruta-baga turnips can be had all the year round. 

Estragon appears from March until December. 



WATER-MELONS AND MUSK-MELONS. 



WATER-MELONS first make their appearance in market about the 
first of July, and can be had until the middle of October. Un- 
like the musk-melbn, they are of a rather hardy nature, and 
after the melon has grown on the vine, the changes in temperature, or rain, 
have little effect on them. The first in market come from Florida, and as 
the season advances we get them from further North, until New Jersey is 
reached. More melons are raised in Georgia than in any other State, and of 
far better quality. The best variety to be relied on, as to quality, is known 
as the " Gem. '' i ^ 

Musk-melons, although raised in nearly all parts of the country where 
the climate will admit, are, seldom shipped to New York from any distance 
further than North Carolina, as a musk-melon, in order to be of good fla- 
vor, must be ripened, or nearly so, on the vine. When ripe they are 
so easily cracked or mashed that they would not stand transportation. 
For the past two or three years, a few, of a rather hard-rind variety, but 
of excellent flavor, have been shipped from New Orleans, but with only 
partial success, as the cost of transportation and the loss are so great that 
it hardly pays. We often hear the remark, "I have not catena good 
melon this season." This can be easily explained. 

A melon is of a very sensitive nature, and the delicious flavor is destroyed 
by rain or cold weather. A melon-patch from which we get finely flavored 
melons to-day, may be ruined (as to flavor) for a few days, by a heavy 
rain-storm ; for the melon absorbs water like a sponge. When we have 
hot nights and no rain, we have perfect melons. Invariably, it is during 
this kind of weather that they are most appreciated. Melons first appear 
about the middle of July, and last until cold weather.

HOW TO SET A TABLE. 



To set a table seems, perhaps, very easy, but to set it properly and 
tastily is not such an easy matter. The advice herewith, given may 
prove advantageous to many. 
Place the table in the centre of the dining-room, under the chandelier, 
snd see to it that it is perfectly steady ; that is to say, that there is no

danger of its being shaken while the dinner is in progress. Should it not 
rest firmly, perhaps an old relic, in the shape of a Bland Dollar, could be 
made serviceable by placing it under one of the feet. See to it that 
there is plenty of space between each cover ; it is annoying to come in 
contact with every move of your neighbor. 

A table for six persons should be six feet long. Take a woolen cloth 
and put it over the table, and then place a linen cloth on top of it ; this 
■will deaden the noise of plates and glasses. 

Flowers should never be absent from the table when you have guests ; 
they can be procured at all seasons. A large basket or bouquet should be 
placed in the centre of the table ; a large bouquet on the right side for 
each lady, and a small iautonni/re for each gentleman, also on the right 
side of the cover. 



20 THE TABLE. 



On each side of the centre-piece place a fruit-stand, nicely arranged 
with the choicest fruits of the season. Next to this place a compotier with 
assorted cakes. Place celery, olives, or radishes symmetrically in the 
space that Js left between the centre and the covers. Fish-knives, soup- 
spoons, and oyster-forks must be placed on the right side of the plate, 
and the fork on the left side. If desired, place fancy pieces on the table, 
{pieces monties) ; but as the foregoing items pertain only to a dinner for six 
persons it would crowd out much available space. The diagram on the 
preceding page will illustrate the arrangement of the glasses on the table. 

Napkins can be arranged in various styles and figures ; into flowers or 
any other desired form. The latest and most fashionable way is to arrange 
them folded plainly, so as to show the monogram of the family. A small 
salt-cellar should be placed at each cover, to avoid asking the servant for it. 

Menus, either printed or written, should be placed at each cover. It 
is not a breach of etiquette to refuse a course you do not desire ; by know- 
ing what is coming, you can with propriety refuse a course, and take the 
next one. 

About ten minutes before commencing dinner, fill the decanters with 
Sauterne and with sherry, and place the same on the table, as in diagram, 
marked Cand D, 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 



NEARLY every family of means is in the habit of giving a few dinners 
to its friends during the year. As a matter of course, the mem- 
bers of the family are, in return, invited to " dine out." 

If you invite your friends to a dinner, you should not wish them to 
go away dissatisfied. After a varied experience of many years, both in 
this country and in Europe, the author feels that no apologies are neces- 
sary if he endeavors to enlighten our epicures and dinner-givers as to how 
to arrange and serve a fine dinner, from commencement to close, after the 
manner of the French. 

It should not be forgotten that much depends upon the appearance of 
the table, and the manner of serving the courses. In fact, more success 
can be attained by studied attention to the room, the table, and the serv- 
ing of the courses, than in the preparation of costly viands. 

On entering a dining-room, the first object which strikes the eye is the 
table. If the table is void of flowers, and other side decorations, includ- 
ing olives, radishes, and celery, tastefully arranged napkins and wine- 
glasses, an impression is given of a boarding-house table. On the contrary, 
when you see a beautifully decorated and artistically arranged table, the 
heart is immediately gladdened. i 

A proper regard should be given to the comfort of the guests as 
regards temperature. Have the room neither too cold nor too warm ; the 



HOW TO SERVE MEALS. 21 

teinperature should never exceed sixty degrees. The dining-room should 
be well aired before dinner commences. Great care should be taken that 
the dinner be served very hot. Noises with plates and glasses should 
be avoided. 

There is as much system in serving a fine dinner as there is in running 
a railroad, or in any other business. French dinners are generally served 
in three main co\iLXSSS,\iz., Jielev/s, Entr/es, axiA Rotis ; all the rest are 
considered side courses. It depends entirely on the taste of the host as 
to how many main courses he desires served. The author would suggest 
two relev/s, three entries, and one or two rotis; this could be made an 
elaborate dinner. 

Naturally, what you shall serve will depend entirely on yrhat there is 
in market at the season. For instance, you cannot serve brook-trout 
in January, or canvas-back duck during the months of June, July, August, 
or September. However, the very best in the market should invariably 
be selected. 

Care should be taken to have the wines at the right temperature. 
Sherry, Sauterne, Chablis, and Rhine wines should always be served cold. 
Champagne should be served very cold, almost at the freezing-point. 
Bordeaux and Burgundy should be kept twelve hours before dinner in a 
room at a temperature of seventy degrees. Servants should be instructed 
not to fill the glasses more than three-fourths full; for guests are in dan- 
ger of soiling their dresses, and, again, it is not considered good form. 

The following is a fair menu for a New Year's dinner, with the . 
necessary instructions how to serve it:

2 2 , THE TABLE. 



To begin with the oysters or clams: place some finely chopped ice on 
each soup-plate, with a small fancy napkin on top. Arrange the oysters 
or clams nicely on top of each plate, with a piece of lemon, and serve. 
With this course serve also Haut Sauterne. It is understood that the 
oysters or clams are to be served after all the guests are seated. It should 
be made a rule never to remove any plates while some of the guests are 
still eating. When all have finished, remove the oyster-plates and leave 
dinner-plates in their stead ; then serve the soup. The servant is expected 
to present a plate of each kind to each guest, and ask which is preferred. 
Serve sherry with the soup. Always serve the plates on the right side, 
and remove on the left. Serve timbales. F'irst put a spoonful of sauce 
on each plate, and then the timbale ; at the same time you are serving the 
timbale, remove the cold plates and serve the fish. Put the fish on the 
plates, then the sauce, with a. few potatoes on the same plate. Serve 
Rauenthaler-Berg. Remove the plates and serve fillet of beef, which 
should be cut in small, even slices. Put the sauce on the plate, and then, 
the fillet. Place the artichokes on the same plate. \ Serve Pommery Sec 
with this and with t'.ie other course. Remove the plates and serve saddle 
of mutton. Cut the loin of the saddle lengthwise, ^nd then crosswise, 
and serve with a little gravy and a spoonful of string-beans on the same 
plate. When this course is finished, serve the sweetbreads. Put the 
sauce first on the plate, as with the fillet, with a spoonful of peas. With 
this serve Chateau Latour. The,next course, terrapin, should be served 
in a very hot tureen. Before serving, add a little fine sherry ; mix well, 
and give each guest a small portion. Serve more Chateau Latour with 
this course. 

After this comes sorbet. This can be served in glasses or in shells; 
for instance, take six lemons or six small oranges, cut off the tops, take 
the soft parts out of them, and in them place the sorbet. Arrange them 
on cold dessert-plates, decorated with small fancy napkins or fancy paper. 
While the'^guests are enjoying the sorbet, remove sherry, Sauterne, and 
Hock glasses, no matter if empty or full. (Replace knives and forks 
before serving the sorbet.) 

Now come canvas-back ducks. Before serving, place them for a 
moment before the host, so that all the guests can see them. Cut off only , 
the breasts, and serve with a little of the gravy and a small piece of fried 
hominy, on very hot plates; then pass around the currant jelly. You can 
serve a whole breast or a half one; however, during a hearty dinner, a 
half one is preferable; this is entirely at the disposition of the host. Serve 
celery salad with mayonnaise dressing on separate dessert-plates, with 
forks, and then serve Chambertin. 

When this course is finished, remove all side dishes, casters, and salt 
and pepper cruets, and leave nothing on the table but flowers, fruits, and 
cakes. Clean the table neatly with a brush or napkin, and then place 
dessert spoons and forks at each cover. Serve plum pudding the same as 
omelette au rum. Pour the rum over the pudding, spread powdered 
sugar on top, and, with a spoon, keep pouring the burning liquid over it 



HOW TO SEUVE MEALS. 23 

until it ceases to burn. Then cut in slices and serve, putting some of the 
liquid on each plate. 

Vanilla and pistache ice-cream should be served on cold dessert-plates 
with fancy paper underneath, and with dessert spoons and forks. Servp 
the cakes with the ice-cream. 

When this course is finished, serve to each guest a finger-bowl, with a 
thin slice of lemon in the water. Small cups for coffee should be passed 
at the same time. Fruits, nuts, and raisins come next. It is customary 
with some old American families to introduce at this course a bottle of 
very old Madeira wine; but this is certainly not necessary. 

Now comes the last,. the coffee, which must be served fresh and very 
hot, for the preparation of which the author refers you to page 381. At 
the same time serve cordials, and the dinner will be completed. 



Menus for Every, Day in the Year. 



BXPIvANA-TORY NOTE. 

While these menus are simple and complete, it is not supposed that they can always be 
carried out in detail. They will, however, furnish suggestions to house-keepers who are daily 
. perplexed with the question, "What shHll we have for brealcfest, mncheon, and dinner?" The 
number placed after each dish refers to the recipe showing how the dish is prepared. The 
menus are arranged so as to be used foi any year. New Year's, 1890, will begin on a Wednes- 
day in-^tead of a Tuesday, "as here printed; in that case, use the New "Year's menu and then turn 
to the first Thursda\ in January and proceed in regular order. Should you come out uneven 
at the end of the month, through skipping some days at the first, turn back again to the begin- 
ning. For instanre should Thursday be the 29th ofjanuary, instead of the last, as punted, turn 
back to the first Friday in January, and proceed until the month is completed. Special menus 
have been prepared for New Year's Day, Washmgton's Birthday, FourUi of July, Thanksgiving 
Day, and Christmas. «

thyme, and bay-leaf from dropping out of the bouquet while cooking; fold 
it well, and tightly tie with a. string, and use when required in various 
recipes. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful.

minutes ; remove, dress them on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and send 
to the table. 

270. Small BoucMes k la Beine. — Roll three-quarters of a pound of 
ifeuilletage paste (No. 1076) to a quarter of an inch thick ; let it rest for ten 
minutes in a cold place, then cut six rounds out of the paste with a No. 4 
channeled paste-cutter. Lay them on a bordei-less, buttered tin baking- 
dish, slightly apart from each other ; cover with beaten egg, and make a 
mark on the surface of each with a paste-cutter, No. 2, being careful to dip 
the cutter each time in hot water, so that the marked outline may remain 
perfect. Put them in a brisk oven for twelve minutes ; then lift the 
covers with a knife, and fill each one with a white salpicon royal (No. 256)

275. Oysters en Petites Caisses. — Open and blanch for five minutes 
twenty-four medium-sized oysters in a sautoire with half a glassful of

add one pint of well-reduced veloutfe sauce (No. 152), and let cook for 
another five minutes, adding half an ounce of crawfish butter (No. 150), 
and stirring it occasionally. Fill six buttered paper' boxes with four 
oysters each, and the garnishing equally divided. Sprinkle over a little 
fresh bread-crumbs, and arrange them on a tin roasting-pan. Spread a

ing six hashed mushrooms. Sweetbread croquettes are prepared the 
same, only substituting four blanched sweetbreads (No. 6oi) for the 
chicken.

buttered sautoire, spreading the preparation one inch thick on the bottom. 
Cover with a buttered paper, press it well down, and put away to cool. 
Cut the preparation with a plain paste-cutter into six parts ; roll each one

280. AnehoTieS on Toast. — Prepare with American bread six dry 
toasts, spread over them a little anchovy butter (No. 146), and cover each

_ oven for one minute. Arrange them on a dish with a folded napkin, and 
serve. 

281. CaTliare on Toast. — Prepare six toasts of American bread. Put 
half the contents of a small box of Russian caviare into a sautoire ; add 
two tablespoonfuls of cream, and heat one and a half minutes on the 
stove, stirring it carefully meanwhile ; pour this over the toasts, and 
serve on a dish with a folded napkin. 

282. Then Marine. — Fold a napkin on a radish-dish, and dress on it 
the desired quantity of Thon Marin6 — -fickled tunny. Decorate with a 
little fresh parsley, and serve as a hors-dceuvre. 

283. Sardines k I'Huile. — Lift the sardines carefully out of the box 
to avoid breaking them, and lay them on a plate ; neatly pare ofif the 
loose skin, then dress on a radish-dish, and decorate with parsley.

drain them on a cloth, then dress them artistically on a radish-dish. 
Decorate with a hashed, hard-boiled egg and some chopped parsley. 



JHORS D-CEUVRES. iqI 



285. Norwegian Anchovies. — These are considered far superior to 
the bottled anchovies. On talcing them out of the lieg they should be 
placed in cold, fresh water for two hours, then drained, and with the 
hand split in two along the backbone. Lay them in a small bowl and 
cover with sweet oil, and use as desired. 

286. Sancisson de Lyon. — Procure a medium-sized, fine saucisson 
de Lyon, cut twelve very thin slices from it, dress nicely upon a radish- 
dish, and place a few parsley-leaves in the centre. 

287. Mortadella. — To be served the same as the above (No. 286). 

'' 288. Tomatoes, side dish. — Take six fine, firm, red tomatoes, wipe 
well, then plunge them into boiling water for one minute, drain and 
peel them. Put them in a cool place, and when thoroughly cold, cut 
them into slices, arrange them on a radish-dish, sprinkle a, little salt, 
pepper, and vinegar over. 

289. Cnciimbers, side dish. — Take two medium-sized, fine cjcum- 
bers, peel neatly, and cut them in thin slices. Place in a bowl with a 
good pinch of salt, and put them in a cold place for two hours. Then 
drain the liquid off, and season with half a pinch of pepper, a tablespoon- 
ful of vinegar, and the same quantity of oil. Dress nicely in a radish- 
dish. 

290. Celery, in glass. — Procure a bunch of fine, white Kalamazoo 
celery, pare off the green stalks, and trim the roots neatly. Be careful to 
save the clear, white hearts. Cut each plant lengthwise into four equal 
branches. Wash them well in cold water, and put them into clean water 
with a piece of ice until ready to serve ; then arrange them nicely in a 
celery glass, or dress on a china radish-dish, with a few pieces of ice in 
the centre. 

291. Celery, frizzled. — Another and economical way to prepare celery 
for a side dish to decorate the table. Take only one large head of fine 
celery. Pare off the green stalks, and cut off the root (reserving it for 
a delicious and wholesome salad). Cut the stalk lengthwise into four 
equal branches. Wash them wrfl in cold water, then cut each one 
into pieces about as long as one's finger ; by so doing, all the branches 
will be separated. With the aid of a, small, keen knife pare the thin 
sides a little, making five or six slits in each piece, starting from the top, 
downwards, leaving half to three-quarters of an inch uncut; place 
them in cold water with plenty of ice, leaving them in for two hours. 
Lift it from the ice-water, artistically dress on a round glass dish, and 
send to the table. Celery arranged and served in this way makes a beauti- 
ful effect on the table, but requires a little patience in its preparation. 

292. Radishes, how to prepare. — If the radishes be quite large, take 
three bunches — if small, four bunches — being careful to select them 
round, firm, and the reddest procurable. Pare off all the leaves and 
stems except the two prettiest on each radish. Cut away the roots, and 
also a little of the peel around the roots. With a small, sharp"" knife 
divide the remaining peel into five or six equal-sized leaves, beginning 
at the root end, and cutting toward the green stems, but being careful to 



192 THE TABLE. 



avoid detaching the leaves. They can be formed into any desired desigx 
by cutting them with care. Place them in cold water until required. 
When serving, arrange the radishes artistically on a flat saucer, the 
radishes meeting toward the centre, ithe green leaves lying outward. 
Serve with chopped ice over them. 

293. Remarks Regarding Radishes.— The following incident'^ hap- 
pened in my presence over twenty-five years ago. One evening, dinner was 
served to a party of prominent gentlemen in Lyons, France, among whom 
were Alexander Dumas, p6re, the great novelist, and Berger, the famous 
billiard player. While the waiter was in the act of handing the radishes 
to M. Dumas, he saw a change come over him ; anger was depicted in 
his face, and he thoroughly expected to see the radishes, radish-dish, etc., 
flung full at him. He stood amazed, not daring to question the dis- 
tinguished guest. When his anger subsided, he amiably explained 
that the cause of his sudden ill-temper was offering to him radishes 
peeled, and deprived of their green stalks; he asserted that the healthiest 
and best parts had been removed. After inquiries of more experienced 
co-laborers, the waiter thoroughly agreed with M. Dumas, and experi- 
ence has taught him the correctness of his judgment. 

Radishes are a luxurious and healthful'adjunct to the dinner-table, and 
can be procured almost the whole year ; but in the spring the markets 
are more plentifully supplied, and that is the most wholesome season to 
partake of them. 

294.' Welsll Rarebit. ^Take one pound of American cheese ; cut up 
in small pieces. Place them in a sautoire, adding half a glassful of good ale. 
Season with half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Stir it continually with 
a wooden spoon until the mass is well melted, which will take about ten 
minutes. Have' six nice, fresh, large pieces of toast ; arrange them on a. 
very hot dish, and distribute the preparation equally over, serving the 
rarebit very hot. 

295. Cfolden Buck. — Proceed as, for the above (No. 294), and when 
ready to serve, dress a poached egg (No. 404) on each piece of toast, and 
serve very hot. 

296. Gherkin Buck. — Prepared the same as Golden Buck (No. 295), 
only adding to each toast a slice of broiled bacon (No. 754), and sending 
to the table very hot. 

297. Welsh Rarebit an Gratin.— Prepare six toasts of American 
bread ; broil them lightly, remove, and cover each with a slice of Swiss 
cheese a little less than half an inch thick ; lay them in a roasting-pan, 
sprinkling a very little pepper over. Put in the oven for ten minutes. 
Arrange the toasts on a very hot dish, and send to the table. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 
Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 
A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a tea- 
spoonful.

298. How to Serve Oysters for PriTate Families.— Oysters should 
be kept in a very cold place before they are opened, and well washed 
before using, otherwise their appearance will be destroyed. They should, 
according to the French custom, be opened on the deep shell, so as to 
better preserve the liquor, then laid on finely chopped ice for a short time 
— too long destroys their flavor. While they should be kept as cold as 
possible, they should never be allowed to freeze, therefore they must only 
be opened shortly before they are needed ; for once frozen, they quickly 
turn sour. The proper way to open them is to place the deep shell in 
the palm of the left hand, and break them on one side. The Boston stab- 
bing-knife is preferable for this, but if there be none handy use a small 
block that the oyster can fit into, and stab it on the edge ; or even a chop- 
ping-block and chopping-knife may be employed in case of necessity. 
Serve six oysters for each person, nicely arranged on oyster-plates with 
quarters of lemon. 

299. Oysters k 1' Alexandre Dumas. — Place in a sauce-bowl a heaped 
teaspoonful of salt, three-quarters of a teaspoonful of very finely crushed 
white pepper, one medium-sized, fine, sound, well-peeled, and very finely 
chopped shallot, one heaped teaspoonful of very finely chopped chives, 
and half a teaspoonful of parsley, also very finely chopped up. Mix lightly 
together, then pour in a light teaspoonful of olive oil, six drops of Tabasco 
sauce, one saltspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and lastly one light gill, 
or five and a half tablespoonfuls, of good vinegar. Mix it thoroughly with 
a spoon ; send to the table, and with a teaspoon pour a little of the sauce 
over each oyster just before eating them. 

300. How to serve Clams. — Clams should be served on deep plates, 
covered previously with finely chopped ice. To have them sweet and 
fresh, they should be kept as cold as possible. Serve six on each plate 
with quarters of lemon. 

301. To prepare Breaded Fish. — i. After the fish is pared, cleaned, 
and dried, dip it first in milk, then in flour, and fry in very hot fat. 

2. Take very clean fish, dip it in beaten egg, then in freshly grated 
bread-crumbs, and fry in very hot fat. 

3. For certain fish, like whitebait, immerse them in milk, then in flour 
mixed with pulverized crackers, shake well in a colander, and throw into 
very hot fat. Oysters are breaded the same way, but should be flattened 
before frying. 

4. For croustades of rice or potatoes, dip in beaten egg and roll in 
fresh bread-crumbs ; repeat three times before frying. 

302. Salmon, en Fapillotes. — Procure two pounds of very fresh sal- 
mon and cut it into six even slices. Season these with a good pinch of

salt "and a pinch of pepper. ' Roll them well. Cut out six heart-shaped 
pieces of paper, oil them nicely, and l^ave twelve' thin slices of cooked 
ham (No. 753), then proceed to prepare them exactly as for mackerel en 
papillote (No. 330). 

303. Salmon, oyster sauce. — Place two pounds of very fresh salmoti 
in a fish-kettle, completely cover with cold water, season with a. handful 
of salt, add one medium-sized, sliced onion, half a wine-glassful of white 
vinegar, eight whole peppers, two cloves, and two parsley-roots. Range 
the kettle on a brisk fire. Five minutes after coming to a boil the salmon

753. How to Prepare Ham for Broiling and FiTing. — Procure a fine, 
sound, smoked ham, weighing about twelve to thirteen pounds, select- 
ing it as lean as possible. With a sharp knife, begin cutting it care- 
fully at the end of the shank bone, between the bone and the string used 
for hanging purposes, coming down on to the knuckle ; follow the edge 
of the bone, until the small edge-bone is fully reached, then make a 
straight cross-cut from the bone, so as to separate it entirely. When this 
is accomplished, put the bone part aside for soup, garnishing, scrambled 
eggs, sauces, or any other needful purposes. Keep the ham hung up in 
a dry place in a moderate temperature. 

For broiling and frying, — Cut from the boneless part the necessary 
number of slices desired to be used each time, as thin as possible, always 
beginning from the side of the edge-bone. Pare off the skin neatly from 
the slices, and arrange them on the broiler, then broil them for two min- 
utes on each side; take from off the fire, dress them on a hot dish, and 
send to the table. 

By preparing the ham as described in the above, it will always be 
crispand enjoyable. When frying, four minutes will be sufficient in very 
hot fat. 

754. How to Prepare English Breakfast Bacon. — Procure a fine, fresh

number of slices desired for immediate use, and no more. Thin slices are 



262 THE TABLE. 



always prelerable, so that the bacon, whether- broiled or fried, will be 
crispy and tasty. When cutting off the slices be careful to avoid detach- 
ing them from the sliin, also cut them crosswise, but never lengthwise. 
Arrange the slices on the broiler, and broil on a moderate fire for two 
minutes on each side ; dress the crispy slices on a hot dish, and serve 
immediately. 

Four minutes will suffice for frying. See that the bacon is kept hang- 
ing by the string in a dry, cool place, but never put it on the ice. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful.

1076. Feililletage, or Pnff Paste. —Have ready one pound of flour, one 
pound of fresh butter, one pint of ice-water, and a saltspoonful of salt. 
If the butter be salted instead of fresh, no salt is necessary, but wash the 
butter well before using it. Put the flour on the table, make a hollow 
space in the centre, then put in it one ounce of the butter, adding the pint 
of ice-water and the salt, and mix the whole well together, incorporating 
it gradually. Put it aside in a cool place for five minutes. Have ready 
the remaining fifteen ounces of butter, which must be very firm ; sprinkle 
the space of a square foot of the table with a very little flour, place the 
dough on it, then lengthen and widen with a wooden roller to the thick- 
ness of half an inch, and lay the fifteen ounces of butter in one lump in 
the centre. Fold over the four edges so as to enclose it, then flatten 
again lightly with the roller until it forms a piece two inches thick, and 
then put it away to cool for ten minutes. Roll it again lengthwise, fold 
it in four, and let it rest for another five minutes ; then repeat the same 
twice more, rolling it each time in a contrary direction. After five min. 
utes it will be ready for use. This feuilletage, or puff paste, if put away 
carefully in a cool place, will keep for three days, and can be used for the 
following purposes : vol-au-vents of chickens, oysters, clams, shrimps, 
lobsters, codfish, crabs, and crawfish; also for making chicken patties, 
bouchfees a la reine, all'^inds of tarts, allumettes, mille-feuilles, chaus- 
sons, turnovers, petits pat^s i, la religieuse, etc., etc. 

1077. Paste for Pies. — Sift on a table one pound of flour ; make a 
hollow space in the centre, pour into it a pint of cold water, two ounces 
of butter, and half a saltspoonful of salt; then, with the hand, knead the 
ingredients well together for two minutes, and gradually and slowly incor- 
porate the flour with the rest for four minutes. Lay the paste on a dish, and 
put it to rest in a cool place for three minutes. Have ready six ounces of 
well-washed butter in one lump, as for feuilletage (No. 1076); return the 
paste to the table, flatten it slightly, then put the lump of butter in the 
centre, fold over the edges, so as to enclose the butter, then roll it out 
lengthwise with the pastry roller, and refold the paste into three folds. 
Let it rest againin a cool place for three minutes, then roll it again, fold 
it as before, and set it in the ice-box for five minutes ; the paste will now 
be ready to use, and by keeping it in the ice-box it will remain in good 
condition for three days.

and the pastry bag will then be ready for use. - 

The accompanying design will show how it should be made. 




PASTRY-BAG. 

\ 

This pastry-bag is essential and useful for kitchen and pastry use, being 
both facile and economical, but care must be taken to wash it thoroughly, 
and immediately after using it, and to let it dry perfectly, otherwise it 
will soon become useless. 

1080. How to Clean and Prepare Sultana Currants and Raisins for 
Pastry. — To avoid the trouble of preparing them each time they are 
needed, it were better to clean many at a time, for they will keep in 
perfect condition for five or six months, if put away in a well-closed tin 
box. Procure ten pounds of currants or Sultana raisins, lay them on a 
table, and should they be damp, dredge a little flour over to prevent them 
adhering to the hands'. Rub them thoroughly, then take a wire sieve. 
No. 3 (or as fine a one as will prevent them passing through), place the 



DESSEJiTS. 



319 



currants on it, and shake them well for two or three minutes, so that they 
be perfectly free from flour and stalks. Lay the sieve containing the 
currants in a large dish-pan, filling it to the level of the sieve with hot 
■water, then, with a skimmer, stir them, so that they get washed thoroughly 
for at least five minutes. Lift up the sieve, and^let them drain in tlie 
same for three minutes. Cover an iron oven-pan with a sheet of brown 
paper, pour the currants on it, spreading them out evenly, and set it in a 
very slow oven for ten minutes; remove, and lay them aside in the warm- 
est spot on the kitchen shelf, and leave them to dry thoroughly for at least 
two days. If in the country, the pan can be left out in the sun during the 
day. When dry, lay them on the table, and should any more foreign 
matter be found among them, pick it out carefully with the fingers, and 
examine them well to see whether they be free of stones, stalks, stems, 
sand, &c. When finished, put them away in a closed tin box, and they 
will then be ready for use. 

1081. How to Clean Malag^a Baisins. — Have as many Malaga raisins 
as deemed necessary, but it were better to purchase five pounds at a 
time. Lay the raisins on a table, have a bowl of cold water on the right 
hand, and the raisins in front; pick off the dry stalks adhering to them, 
then, either using a small knife or the fingers, pick out the seeds, taking 
care to wet the fingers in the bowl of water, so as to prevent them stick- 
ing while seeding them. Close up again, giving them their original form; 
when finished, put them in a tin can, cover well, and place in a moderate 

■ temperature for use when required. Raisins prepared in this way will 
surely keep six months.

and leaving an inch space clear around the edge of the plate ; take the 
remaining five ounces of paste, roll it out round-shaped, the same as 
before, fold it in two, and, with a knife, make incisions in the centre, of half 
an inch each. Moisten lightly the edge of the plate with a little beaten 
egg, then cover with the paste, pressing down with the hand all around 
the edge, so as to inclose the preparation entirely, then moisten the surface 
slightly with the beaten egg. Place in a moderate oven, and let bake for 
fifty minutes; remove it to the oven-door, sprinkle plenty of powdered

it all up. With a small hair pastry-brush dipped in beaten egg, wet the 
edges of the oval, and arrange the pieces all around, crown-shaped. Bake 
this croustade in a moderate oven thirty minutes. Have ready six ounces 
of boiled rice (No. 1172). Peel and core six medium-sized fine apples. 
Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of powdered sugar, a gill of 
cold water, and^alf a saltspoonful of salt. Put on the lid, and let cook 
on a slow fire for twenty minutes. Arrange half the rice on the croustade, 
dress the apples over, and fill up the cavities with the rest of the rice. 
Add to the juice of the apples in the pan two ounces of apricot marma- 
lade (No. 1335). Mix well for two minutes and pour it over the whole. 
Then set it in a slow oven for fifteen minutes. Remove, and beat up two 
eggs as for a meringue (No. 1247), mixing in two ounces of powdered 
sugar. Put this into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and decorate the surface of 
the croustade artistically with it, sprinkling a little sugar over. . Return 
it to the oven for five minutes, to get a good color. Pass a knife gently 
under the croustade, and dexterously slide it from the baking-pan onto a 
hot dessert-dish, and serve.

Continue to repeat this for five minutes. Roll the paste into a ball, put 
it on a dish, cover with a napkin, and set it in a cool place to rest for 
fifteen minutes. Roll it put to the thickness of a fifty-cent j^iece. With a 
knife cut it into strips two inches wide, and from these, beginning at the 
end of each, shred it with the knife into narrow pieces resembling matches. 
Leave these to dry slightly on a floured board for thirty niinutes, and they 
will be ready for use. 

11S3. Buckwheat Cakes.— Dilute one drachm of compressed yeast with 
a gill of lukewarm water, and let it rest for ten minutes. Add it to a half

season with a light pinch of salt. Mix thoroughly with the spatula, cover 
the basin with a cloth, and let rest for four hours. 

Have a griddle large enough to hold six cakes. Grease lightly with a 
piece of fat pork-rind, and place it on a hot stove. Pour half of the batter 
into the six sections of the griddle, distributing it evenly. Bake two and 
a half minutes, turn over and bake two and a half minutes longer. Heap 
them on a hot dessert-dish. Make the other six exactly the same way.

a basin. Make a hollow in the centre, and drop into it one egg yolk, half 
a teaspoontul of sweet oil, a tablespoonful of brandy, and a light saltspoon- 
ful of salt. Mix all the ingredients, except the flour, for three minutes, 
using the hand. Then gradually knead in the flour, meanwhile dropping 
in, little by little, one gill of cold water. Mix well, moving in the same 
direction for five minutes. Then put it into a vessel, cover with a cloth, 
and set aside to rest for three or four hours. When ready to use, beat 
the whites of three eggs to a froth with a pastry-whip, add it to the batter, 
and mix together thoroughly with the spatula for two minutes. It will

DESSEJiTS. 341 

ounces of the batter, and bake two minutes ; turn over, and bake the 
other side as long. Turn the pancake on a hot dessert-dish, and sprinkle 
over plenty of powdered sugar. Make eleven more out of the remaining 
batter. Serve very hot. 

1187. French Pancakes h. la Gel6e.— Make the batter exactly the same 
as for No. 1186. When cooked, arrange the pancakes neatly upon a nap 
kin, and spread over each one about a teaspoonful of currant jelly. Foil 
them up nicely, and dress on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkling a little pow 
dered sugar over. Then, with a red-hot iron, glaze the surface of each cake • 
in three different parts ; wipe the sides of the dish nicely, and send to the 
table. 

French pancakes with apple, apricot, plum, pineapple, strawberry, 
raspberry, or peach jelly are to be prepared exactly the same, using differ- 
ent jellies. ' 

1188. German Pancakes. — Prepare a batter as for French pancakes 
(No. 1186) ; butter an iron pan, one foot in diameter and one and a half 
inches deep. Place this on a hot stove, and pour all the batter into it, 
letting it cook for three minutes. Remove to a brisk oven for seven min- 
utes. Take it out, slide the cake carefully on a hot dessert-dish, and send 
it to the table with six pieces of lemon. 

1189. German Pancakes with Apples. — Prepare the batter exactly as 
for No. n88. Butter the pan as for the above. When the batter has been

When ready, slide it carefully on a hot dessert-dish, sprinkle plentifully 
with powdfered sugar, and send to the table very hot, with six pieces of 
lemon separately. 

1190. Batter for Fritters. — Mix a quarter of a pound of sifted flour in 
a. small basin, with half a pint of lukewarm water, to which three-quar- 
ters of an ounce of fresh butter has been added. Place in a saucepan, 
which should be tilted on the range so that when the water boils the 
butter can be skimmed off the top. Add, if necessary, a little more water 
to make a soft paste, beating well with a spatula, to keep it free from 
lumps, and of a proper consistence ; it must be gray and compact-looking. 
Add just a little warm water to render the paste soft and diluted, although 
sufficiently thick to cover the objects for which it is intended ; that means, 
it must drop easily from the spoon. Add to this half a pinch of salt and 
two egg-whites ; beat well together for one minute, and use at once. 

1191. Apple Fritters. — Take three medium-sized, fine, sound apples; 
peel and core them neatly. Cut each into six equal round slices. Place 
them in a vessel, pour over a gill of good brandy, add a light saltspoon- 
ful of ground cinnamon, and let all steep for two hours. Strain them 
through a fine sieve, being careful to keep them whole, and saving the 
liquid for further use. Prepare a fritter batter, as for No. 1190, dip each 
slice separately into it, and with a spoon, drop them singly into very hot 
but not boiling lard, being careful to remove them with a skimmer as 
soon as they are of a good golden color. Two minutes will be sufficient

to have them properly done. Then lay them on ^a clean cloth, to dry oft 
the grease. Arrange a folded napkin on a hot dessert-dish ; arrange the 
fritters on it, and leave it at the oven door for two minutes. Dredge 
about an ounce of powdered sugar over, and serve. 

1192. Fritters Souffles k la Vanille. — Infuse in a saucepan half of a. 
vanilla-bean in half a pint of boiling milk, and reduce it to half. Remove 
the vanilla-bean, and put in one ounce of good butter. Let it come to a 
boil, then add two ounces of sifted flour, and with the spatula stir briskly, 
to form a paste so stiff that it will no longer adhere to the saucepan. 
Remove it to another vessel. Add one ounce of powdered sugar, two 
egg yolks, and half a saltspoonful of salt. Beat the white of one egg to 
a stiff froth, and mix it in with half a spoonful of whipped cream (No. 
1254); this will form a consistent paste. Roll it on a floured board, 
besprinkle lightly with flour, and cut out pieces the size of a walnut. 
With -a, skimnjer drop them into very hot but not boiling fat. Cook 
quickly for three minutes, until they are a fine golden color. Arrange upon 
a folded napkin, and serve with powdered sugar sifted over. 

1193. Found Cake. — Put in a vessel half a pound of butter, with half 
a pound of powdered sugar. Grate in the rind of half a lemon, and with 
the hand knead well for twenty minutes. Break into a plate five whole 
raw eggs; add gradually and carefully, kneading sharply with the hand 
for ten, minutes longer. Now add half a pound of well-sifted flour, mix- 
ing the whole slowly and thoroughly for five minutes more. Butter a 
two-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with brown paper at the bottom 
and sides. Fill it with the preparation, and put it in a slow oven to bake 
for fully one hour. Remove, and let cool off for about two hours. 
Unmold, detach the paper, and lay it on a pastry wire-grate. Glaze the 
top and sides with a preparation as for vanilla Eclairs (No. 1245). Lay the 
cake on a dessert-dish with a fancy white paper. Prepare three ounces of 
candied cherries, two ounces of angelica, two ounces of red and the same 
of white pears, both candied; cut the cherries in two, the angelica lozenge- 
shaped, and the pears each in six parts (except one white one, which is 
kept whole), keeping the fruits all separate. Place the whole pear on top 
of the cake in the centre, stem upward. Then decorate thus : at the base 
of tbe pear lay two slices of red pear, carefully, one against the other on 
one side. Repeat on the other side, and arrange [in the same way two 
slices of the white pear in the middle of the space on one side, and two 
more slices opposite. Now cover the four empty spaces nearest the pear 
with half a cherry each, and arrange four angelica lozenges in the empty 
place at the end of the layers of pear. Then on each of the four angelica 
points lay half a cherry. Begin decorating the edge of the cake all around 
in a crown-shape with one angelica lozenge, putting near the point one 
half cherry, then another lozenge, and continue the same all around until 
joined. Arrange the remaining slices of pear in the empty space near the 
border, and it will be ready to send to the table. 

1194. Wedding Cake. — Place in a large bowl one pound of powdered 
Ugar and one pound of well-washed butter. Grate in the rind of twa 



DESSERTS. 343 



lemons; and with the hand knead well for ten minutes. Break in ten 
whole eggs, two at a time, and knead for ten minutes longer. Mix in a 
plate a teaspoonful of ground cinnamon, a teaspoonful of ground cloves, 
two of ground allspice, one of mace, and one of grated nutmeg, and add 
these, with half a gill of confectioners' molasses. Mix well for one min- 
ute with the hand. Add one pound of well-sifted flour, stirring for two 
minutes more. Add two poundf of currants, as for No. 1080, two pounds 
of Sultana (No. 1080), two pounds of Malaga raisins (No. 1081), one 
pound of candied citron, finely sliced, one gill of Jamaica rum, and one 
gill of brandy. Mix the whole well together for fifteen minutes — using 
both hands, if necessary. Butter the interior of a plain, five-quart, round 
cake-mold. Line the bottom and sides with paper, leaving it an inch and 
a half higher than the edge of the mold. Pour in all the preparation, and 
place it in a very slow oven to bake for five hours. When done, lay it on 
a table, to cool off for four hours. Unmold, detach the paper, and turn 
the cake bottom up on a wire pastry-grate. After ten minutes, glaze it 
with one egg-white which has been beaten in a bowl with four ounces of 
extra fine sugar, using the spatula; use a knife to apply the glazing. 
Now lay the cake in a warm place to dry for two hours. Then beat up 
the white of an egg with four ounces of extra fine sugar for ten minutes, 
and glaze the cake as before, evenly all around, and lay aside for two 
hours more. After it is thoroughly dried, lay it on a round wooden board, 
with a fancy paper over, two inches wider than the board. Procure a 
fancy wedding-bell, with a miniature bride and groom standing under, lay 
it in the centre of the cake, fastening it on with glace royale (No. 1206), 
pressing it through a paper cornet with a fancy tube. Decorate the sur- 
face of the cake with ornaments made of the glace; also a fancy border . 
around the edge and base. Let it dry slightly for two hours, and it is 
ready for use. ' 

1195. Sponge Cake. — Put into a copper basin half a, pound of pow- 
dered sugar. Break in seven whole eggs, and grate in the rind of half a 
lemon. Beat well together with the wire whip for one minute ; then 
place it on a slow fire and heat it slightly, stirring it sharply and continu- 
ally. Take it from the fire, and beat it well until thoroughly cold. Re- 
move the whip, and with a. skimmer mix in carefully and slowly half a 
pound of well-sifted flour; two minutes and a half will be sufficient. But- 
ter the interior of a one-quart, round cake-mold, and line it with paper, 
keeping it an inch and a half higher than the mold. Then fill it with the 
preparation, and bake for one hour and fifteen minutes in a moderate 
oven. Let it cool thoroughly for two hours; unmold, place it on a pastry 
wire-grate, and glaze it the same as for vanilla Eclairs (No. 1245). Deco- 
rate artistically with a glace royale (No. 1206), arranging it in any desired 
fanciful design. Serve on a dessert-dish covered with a fancy paper. 

1196. Waffles, with Sngar. — Put in a vessel three ounces of powdered 
sugar, one pound of flour, three raw eggs, three ounces of melted butter; 
mix all well together with a spatula for five minutes. Add a pint and a 
half of sweet cream, and mix again well for two minutes. Have your

waffle-iron hot on both sides, and on a clear fi,re.' Grease with melted 
butter, using a feather for the purpose, and drop into each of the holes 
two tablespoonfiils of the paste. Bake two minutes on each side, and if 
they have not a good golden color bake one minute longer on each side. 
Heap them as fast as cooked on a hot dessert-dish. When all are dorle, 
besprinkle plentifully with powdered sugar, and serve very hot. ' 

1197. Savarill Cakes; — Dissolve two drachms of compressed yeast in 
a gill of lukewarm cream. Add four ounces of sifted flour, knead well 
for two minutes, and set in a warm place for five minutes. Sift into 
another vessel six ounces of flour. Make a hollow in the centre, and 
pour into it two ounces of powdered sugar, four eggs, a gill of lukewarm 
milk, and a saltspoonful of salt. Knead these well for two minutes, but 
do. not mix in the flour. Add three ounces of melted butter and half a 
gill of curagoa (or any other liquor desired), then knead in the flour with 
the other ingredients, adding the yeast-dough previously laid aside, and 
mix with the hands, briskly beating the whole in a contrary direction for 
twenty minutes without ceasing. Cover with a cloth, and set in a warm 
closet to raise double, which will take about half an hour. Butter a 
crown-shaped mold holding about three pints. When ready, take two 
ounces of peeled almonds (No. 1207), mince fine, and add them to the 
dough, and beat well together for two minutes longer. Then with a 
spoon drop the paste carefully into the mold ; this not being quite filled 
to the top. Set aside again in the warm closet until the paste raises to 
the edge ; then place in a moderately brisk oven for twenty-five minutes. 
Should the oven be slow, thirty-five minutes will' be necessary. To 
ascertain whether the cake be perfectly baked, thrust the point of a lard- 
ing-needle into the centre, and should any dough adhere to it, the cake 
must be left in five minutes longer. 

When done, turn it out on a plain, round wire grate, and glaze it with 
a, firm glace ^ I'eau made as follo'^s : put into a sugar-pan one ounce of 
granulated sugar, with one tablespoonful of cold water, and let it come to 
aboil; remove, and add iinmediately a tablespoonful of ourafoa, mixing 
well together. Glaze the cake with this, then let cool. Place a folded 
napkin on a dessert-dish, dress the cake nicely on top, and serve.

above (No. 1197), and when unmolded, place it on a wire grate, but do 
not glaze it. Pour into a saucepan a pint of cold water , with five ounces 
of granulated sugar, and let boil for five minutes. Take it off, and add 
immediately half a gill of kirsch, mixing it in well. Place the grate with 
the savarin in a vessel, take liold of the handle with the right hand, and 
drop the syrup carefully all over the top; lift up the grate and cake. >Re- 
move the syrup remaining in the vessel into the pan, boil it again; return 
the grate and cake to the vessel, and pour over the remaining syrup. 
Then, lifting the grate on one side, glide the cake carefully onto a dessert- 
dish. Put into a saucepan four ounces of candied cherries with half a gill

1199. Savariu Cake h, I'Anglaise.— Prepare a savarin cake as for No. 
1197; when unmolded, place it on a wire grate ; do not glaze it. Cut it 
evenly through the centre, so as to make two equal discs. Garnish the 
top of the under one with four ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), 
arrange the other half on top as carefully as possible, so that the cake has 
its original form. Have a dessert-dish with a folded napkin ; dress the 
cake on top, and serve with a sauce-bowl of creme k I'Anglaise (No. 1200) 
separately. 

1200. Creme k I'Anglaise.— Put into a saucepan two ounces of butter 
and one ounce of flour. Place on a slow fire, and with a. spatula stir 
slightly for two minutes, adding two ounces of sugar, half a gill, of 
Madeira wine, and on'e gill of Middletown milk; stir well again for two 
minutes, to avoid its coming to a boil. Then take it from the fire, and 
immediately add half a gill of rum, stirring it slightly again. ""Pour the 
creme into a sauce-bowl and serve with the savarin. 

1201. Brioches. — Take half a pound of sifted flour, put two ounces of 
it into a vessel. Make a hollow in the centre, and put into this two 
drachms of compressed yeast and half a gill of lukewarm milk. Dissolve 
well the yeast with the milk for about one minute, then quickly beat in 
the flour for one minute. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and let it rest in 
a warm closet for fifteen minutes. Put in another vessel the remaining 
six ounces of flour, make a hollow in the centre, and put into it half a 
saltspoonful of salt, three whole eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sweet cream, 
two ounces of fresh butter, and one ounce of powdered sugar. Mix 
thoroughly with the hand, all except the flour, for three minutes, then 
incorporate the flour gradually, and beat it sharply with the hands for three 
minutes. Add one egg, beat one minute; add another, and beat one min- 
ute longer. Take four ounces of fresh butter, spread it in pieces over the 
paste, then mix in well for two minutes. The yeast being properly raised 
double by this time, add it to the other ingredients, and mix the whole 
carefully by cutting it several times with the hand, being sure to repeat 
this for at least five minutes. Cover the vessel with a cloth, and lay it in 
a closet or elsewhere, at a moderate temperature of about eighty degrees, 
for three hours, when it will be raised to twice the size. Then with the 
right hand cut it again into pieces in every direction, for about four min- 
utes. Then recover the vessel with the cloth, and leave it in a cool 
place for thirty minutes. Dredge a board with flour, pour the paste over 
it; then cut off a three-ounce piece, and lay it aside. With the hands roll 
up the remaining part of the paste into a ball. Butter well a round, two- 
quart mold, line it with paper, and put in the paste. Take the piece laid 
aside, and roll it pear-shaped with the hands. Make a small cavity in the 
centre of the paste in the mold, using a spoon. Arrange' the pear-shaped 
piece in this, having the larger part on top. Then lay the mold on a 
baking-sheet ; glaze the top lightly with beaten egg, and put it in a 
moderate oven. After it has been in fifteen minutes, cover it with a 
buttered paper, close the oven door, and bake for one hour more ; test it 
by thrusting in a larding-needle, and if no dough adheres to this the brioche

from the oven, unmold, and let it cool. Dress on a dessert-dish with a 
folded napkin, and serve. 

1202. Small Brioches. — Prepare the dough as for the above (No. 
1201), and when raised to twice the size, lay it upon a board which has 
been lightly dredged with flour. Cut out a piece of three ounces, and lay 
it aside until needed, then, cut the rest of the paste into twelve equal 
pieces, and with the right hand roll them into separate balls. Lay theSe 
in a pastry baking-pan. Divide the paste laid aside into twelve parts, roll 
them out, and give each a pear-shape. With a spoon make a cavity in the 
centre of each ball, and put into each one of the pear pieces, having the 
larger part on the top. Leave them to rise in a closet for fifteen minutes ; 
glaze them lightly with beaten egg, and put them in a brisk oven for twelve 
or fifteen minutes, but no longer. Remove, and with a light hair-brush 
glaze them all over with fresh butter. Keep in a warm place until ready 
to serve. If the brioches should be required cold, do not glaze them with 
butter, but dress them on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin. It is better 
to prepare the paste the evening previous, covering it with a cloth, and 
leaving it in a cool place over night. 

1203. Brioche k la Cond^. — Have a brioche cooked as for No. 1201, 
and when done, cut it in two, crosswise. Then with a spoon spread over 
the top of the lower half four ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), 
mixed with one ounce of melted butter. Then replace the other half on 
top. Put in a saucepan two ounces of candied cherries, four ounces of 
candied apricots, cut in slices, and four ounces of candied pineapple. Add 
half a pint of cold water, and boil well together on a hot fire for three 
minutes. Dress the brioche on a dessert-dish, pour the preparation over, 
and serve hot. 

1204. Brioches FInttes. — Prepare a brioche paste, as for No. 1203 ; 
lay it on a floured board, and cut it into twelve equal pieces. Roll out 
each one separately with the hands until it is ten inches, or three finger- 
lengths, long, rounding them into shape. Put tliem in a pastry baking- 
pan, and leave them in a. closet to rise for ten minutes ; take out and 
glaze them lightly with beaten eggs, sprinkle them over with powdered 
sugar, and put them in the oven for ten minutes ; remove, and dress them 
on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve when cool. These 
brioches will keep well for three or four days, and they are delicious 
when served with tea, coffee, or chocolate. 

1205. Allumettes. — Take three quarters of a pound of feuilletage (No. 
1076) ; spread it out twelve inches long to four inches wide. Cover with

1207. How to Peel and Found Almonds. — Put the almonds into boil- 
ing water; let them soak three minutes; strain, and lay them in cold 
water to thoroughly cool. Drain well again, and peel by pressing each 
almond between the thumb and fingers. Then put them into a sieve, and 
place them at the door of a slow oven to dry for ten minutes. Now pound 
them gently in a mortar, stirring well to prevent them from getting oily, 
and taking care to pound them very fine for at least ten minutes. Lay 
them on a cold dish, and use when needed. 

1208. Almond Cake GIac6. — Put a quarter of a pound of powdered 
sugar and a quarter of a pound of butter into a bowl ; beat well together 
with a wooden spatula for ten minutes. Break in two eggs; beat well, 
and break in two more; continue beating, and break in two more (six in 
all), until well mixed together. Then grate in the peel of the third of a 
small lemon. Add two ounces of peeled and pounded almonds (No. 1207), 
and a quarter of a pound of flour. Mix gradually together for no longer 
than two minutes. Butter and sugar a round form holding one quart, 
and pour the preparation into it. Place it in a slow oven for one hour. 
See that it gets a good golden color. Take it out ; let it get thoroughly 
cool, and remove from the mold. Lay it on a dish with a folded napkin. 
Glaze the top lightly with a small hair-bush, as for No. 1206, until it 
looks well, and send to the table. 

1209. Bitter Almond Macaroons. — Take a quarter of a pound of sweet 
almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds; peel and pound them as for 
No. 1307. Put them into a bowl with twelve ounces of powdered sugar 
and the whites of two eggs. Mix thoroughly with a wooden spatula for 
at least five minutes. Then take a pastry-bag (No. 1079), slide down to 
the bottom of it a No. 3 tube (which should not be larger than a five-cent 
piece), and pour the preparation into the bag. Prepare a pastry baking- 
pan; lay on it a piece of brown paper the full size of the pan (do not put 
it on the stove at present); then with the two hands press the preparation 
down gently into the papered pan, dropping it carefully into bits the size 
and shape of a silver quarter-dollar, trying to have them as near alike as 
possible, and taking care that each is entirely separated from the others. 
Take a damp towel and drop it gently on to the macaroons, so as to shape 
them perfectly. Then place the pan in a slow oven for twenty minutes. 
Before lifting them out, be careful that they are a good golden color. Let 
them get thoroughly cool. To remove the macaroons easily from the 
paper, wet part of a table; lay the paper over this for two minutes, and 
the macaroons will detach very easily. The above quantity will make 
about fifty macaroons. Put aside in a jar those not needed, as they will 
keep perfectly fresh for several days. 

1210. Sweet Macaroons. — Proceed as for bitter macaroons (No. 1209), 
only omitting the two ounces of bitter almonds, and substituting for them 
two extra ounces of sweet almonds, or six ounces in all.

548 THE TABLE. 



Put them into a saucepan with two ounces of boiled and peeled chestnuts, 
and a piece of cinnamon an inch long. Toss well on the fire for ten min- 
utes, then transfer them to a copper basin, stirring in a ' teaspoonf ul of 
corn-starch, and adding a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar. Place 
on a slow stove for ten minutes, then put aside. When thoroughly 
cooled, add three egg yolks and one whole one ; mik well with a wooden 
spatula, and the preparation will be ready for use. Take a three-pint, 
square mold, butter it lightly, and with a small hair-brush sprinkle in a 
little powdered sugar, and pour in the prepared apple. Place the mold in 
a tin pastry-pan', filling the latter to half the height of the mold with cold 
water, and place the whole in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Take 
the mold from the pan, and lay on top of it a hot, deep dessert-dish, 
slightly larger than the cake ; turn the mold bottom up, and lift it off, 
leaving the cake on the dish. While the cake is in the oven, prepare the 
following sauce : mix in a saucepan two egg yolks, one ounce of pow- 
dered sugar, half a pint of water, and half a teaspoonful of ground cinna- 
mon. Place on a brisk fire, and stir constantly for five minutes, not 
allowing it to boil. When the cream is ready, add half a glassful or a 
gill of rum, or any other kind of liquor. Mix well for half a minute, pour 
the sauce over the cake, and serve very hot. 

1212. St. Honore k la Rose Delmonico. — Peel neatly two medium- 
sized, sound, red oranges. Separate the sections carefully to avoid tear- 
ing the skin, as, should, they lose any of their juice, they would become 
useless. Lay a sheet of paper over a tin pan, arrange the pieces of 
orange on top, and leave them in a warm place to dry for four hours. 
Wipe neatly twenty-four Malaga grapes, leaving on each about a quarter 
of an inch of stem, so that they shall remain firm while using them. Beat 
up a pint and a half of sweet cream h, la vanille as for No. 1254, and lay it 
aside in a. cool place until needed. R611 three ounces of pie-paste (No. 
1077) into a round piece eight inches in diameter. Lay it on a baking- 
sheet ten inches wide, and proceed to prepare a p3,te-i-chou as follows : 

Put into a saucepan a gill of cold milk with one oun'ce of good butter, 
place it on a hot fire, and when boiling, add at once three ounces of well- 
sifted flour. Stir briskly with the spatula all round ; take it from the 
fire, set on a table, and add immediately a saltspoonful of powdered 
sugar, mixing well for one minute more. Break in an egg, stir briskly 
for one minute, break in another, mix again, and then another, mixing all 
together for two minutes. Slide down the pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube 
(No. 3), pour in the' above preparation, and press down the top with the 
hands onto the edge of the paste in the baking-sheet, so as to make an even 
border half an inch high, arid with the remainder of the paste press down 
onto another baking-sheet into twenty-four small, round choux, half an inch 
in diameter, le^ing them one inch apart. Glaze the surfaces with beaten 
egg, and place them in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minutes. Remove,, 
and let them get thoroughly cold. Spread over the paste, inside the bor- 
der, two tablespoonfuls of apple sauce (No. 1328); then put it in a mod- 
erate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. Remove, and put to cool fr>(

thirty minutes. Make a paper cornet, cut off a quarter of an inch from 
the point and put into it three ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326). Press 
this out gently, dividing it evenly into the twenty-four small choux. 
Cook one pound of granulated sugar as for No. 1264. Oil two square 
feet of the surface of a marble table, and place at hand the pan containing 
the sugar. Plunge one of the grapes into this ; remove it immediately 
with a fork and lay it on the oiled table. Proceed the same with the other 
twenty-three, being careful to lay them one inch apart from each oth-jr. 
Now dip twelve of the sections of prepared oranges into the sugar, one by 
one, and lay them on the oiled table exactly the same as tfie grapes. Dip 
carefully the surfaces of the srtiall choux into the sugar, and lay them on 
the same oiled table. Then take the St. Honorfe bottom in the baking- 
sheet, and proceed to arrange it as follows : with the cooked sugar stand- 
ing on the right, lift the choux up, one by one, dipping one side of each 
lightly in the cooked sugar, arranging them on top of the pjLte-4-chou 
border close together to form a crown. Should the sugar be too thick, 
return it to the stove, and let it boil up once ; then take it off, and dip the 
thin part of the oranges lightly in it, and lay them over the small choux, 
the thick part upward, each one adhering to the other, until they form 
the crown. Dip the tops of the grapes lightly into the same sugar, 
and place one on each join of the oranges, with another in the centre, the 
stems being upward ; attach to the small choux the six remaining grapes, 
dividing them evenly. Arrange a fancy paper on a dessert-dish, and lay 
the St. Honorfe over tarefully, then take the froth part only of the 
whipped cream ; transfer it to another vessel, and, with the whip, beat 
briskly for five minutes, adding half a gill of good cognac, a quarter of a 
gill of Swiss kirsch, and three ounces of well-pounded and sifted maca- 
roons (No. 1210). Mix well together for two minutes longer, and fill the 
empty space of the St. Honor6 with three-quarters of this preparation, 
keeping it as high as possible. With the use of the pastry-bag and fancy 
tube press down the rest of the cream, and decorate artistically the top 
and sides, taking care not to put any on the oranges, and send tb the 
table. 

1213. Gingerbread k la Fran^aise. — Make a hollow space in a pound 

of flour laid on the table. Peel and chop up very fine five ounces of 
almonds; put them into the hollow with a saltspoonful of grated nutmeg, 
the same quantity of ground cloves, four ounces of powdered sugar, and 
seven ounces of fresh honey. Knead the ingredients well for five minutes, 
then mix in the flour, and knead the preparation with the hands in all 
directions for fully thirty minutes without ceasing. Finish by forming it 
into a ball. Lay this on a dish, cover it with a napkin, and place it in a 
temperature of about 60° for six hours. Lay the paste on a floured table', 
and roll it out eighteen inches long by twelve wide. Butter well a baking- 
sheet, lay the paste on top, and put it in a very slow oven to bake for 
forty-five minutes. Remove, lay the baking-sheet on the table, cut the cake 
immediately into small pieces, lozenge shaped, one and a half inches long 
by one inch wide, or any other shapS desired; let cool off thoroughly for

well-sifted flour, and mix for three minutes. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, place on top three tin cake-rings, nine inches- in diameter 
and one incli high. Divide the preparation equally into the three rings; 
then place in d moderate oven to bake for thirty minutes. Remove, and 
allow the cakes thirty minutes more to cool. Lift up the paper, with the 
cakes, turn it upside down on the table, remove the paper, and detach the 
cakes from the rings by passing a knife all around. Pick and clean thor- 
oughly three pints of fine, sound, ripe strawberries; have a dessert-dish 
with a fancy paper over, lay one of the cakes on top of this, spread over 
evenly two tablespoonfuls of whipped cream (No. 1254), then cover 
with half the strawberries, nicely and evenly divided. Sprinkle liberally 
with powdered sugar, then cover with another cake, spread over the same 
quantity of cream as before, then arrange the other half of the strawber- 
ries on top; dredge again with powdered sugar, and lay the last cake over 
all, sprinkling with more sugar. Slide down a tube (No. 2) intcra pastry- 
bag (No. 1079), put into it six tablespoonfuls of whipped cream ^ la vanille

• a well-cleaned pastry baking-pan, well buttered and lightly sprinkled with 
flour. Drop the paste carefully into the pan, forming biscuits, eacl^ 
about two inches long, by one inch wide. There should be in all about 
forty biscuits. Place them in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Re- 
move, and lay them on a table. With a hair-brush spread over them six 
ounces of apricot marmalade (No. 1335), and glaze them with a glace i 
I'eau (No. 1197), flavored with half a gill of white cura9oa. Sprinkle 
over them four ounces of finely chopped pistaches; shake the pan lightly, 
and they will.adhere to the glace. Set for two minutes in the oven to get 
dry ; remove, and when cool, dress neatly in a glass bowl, and serve. , 

1235. Almond Biscuits. — Take two ounces of sweet almonds and half 
an ounce of bitter, peel, and pound them as for No. 1207. Then put them 
in a vessel with eight ounces of powdered sugar. Add the/ yolks of five

eggs, and beat the preparation thoroughly for five minutes; then 
separately beat the whites to a froth with a pastry wire whip, and mix in 
with the yolks and sugar, adding also one ounce of flour. Stir thoroughly 
with a wooden spatula until perfectly firm, which will require about five 
minutes. It is now ready. Have six paper boxes, any shape desired, 
and fill them with the preparation, using a tablespoon for the purpose. 
Sprinkle the tops with -<x, little finely powdered sugar, arrange them in a 
pastry baking-pan, and put in a slow oven f jr fifteen minutes ; they must 
get a good golden color. Remove, and when cooled off, dress nicely on a 
dish, and serve. 

1236. Chausson Cakes. — Roll half a pound of feuilletage paste (No. 
1076) into a piece eighteen inches long by three wide, and pare off the 
edges lightly. Cut out six square pieces, all the same size, and with a 
pastry-brush moisten the surfaces with beaten egg. Fold up each piece 
by laying one corner over tlje other, so they will have a triangular shape. 
Put them on a baking-sheet in the oven for twenty minutes ; remove them 
to the oven door ; dredge plenty of powdered sugar over, put them back, 
and close the door for ojie minute and a half, to allow the sugar to melt 
thoroughly. Remove from the oven, and cool for twenty minutes. The 
cakes will have risen about two inches in front. Then, with the thickest 
part of a larding-needle, make a hollow in front of each cake. Put three 
ounces of currant jelly (No. 1326) into a paper cornet, and with it fill the 
insides of the cakes. Dress them on a dessert-dish wjth a folded napkin, 
and serve! 

1237. IPetites Bouch^S des Dames. — Put into a pastry-^bag (No. 1079) 
half the quantity of biscuits-^-la-cuillfere preparation (No. 1231). Butter 
and flour a baking-sheet, and form about fifty small, round biscuits th; 
exact shape of macaroons. Sprinkle slightly with powdered sugar, and 
place in a brisk oven to bake for twelve minutes. Remove, and set to 
cool for fifteen minutes. Then lift them from the pan, and lay them up- 
side down on a table. With a knife make a small cavity in the centre of 
each, half an inc^ in diameter, and fill these with a pastry cream (No. 
1242). 'Fasten them, two by two, to enclose the cream; they will then be 
ball-shaped. Dip carefully one after the other into a glace preparation 
as for chocolate Eclairs (No. 1243). Lay them on a pastry-grate to 
dry for fifteen minutes; then dress on a dessert-dish with a folded napkin, 
and send to the table. 

1238. Petites Bonch^es & la Mrs. Astor.— Butter and flour a baking- 
sheet. Put into a pastry-bag (No. 1079) half the quaiitity of the biscuits- 
a-la-cuill6re preparation (No. 1231), and drop it on the baking-sheet into 
Lima-bean-shaped pieces, one and a half inches long by half 'an inch wide. 
Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar, and place them in a. brisk 
oven to bake for twelve minutes. Take them out and let .them cool for 
fifteen minutes, then put them on a table upside down, and in the 
middle of each one cut a hole one inch long by a quarter of aroinch wide. 
Fill the holes with apricot marmalade (No. 1335), then unite them, two by 
two, so as to enclose the marmalade and be the perfect shape of Lima 



D£ssE/?rs. 357 



beans. Glaze them neatly by dipping them separately into a glace prep- 
aration as for 6clairs k la vanille (No. 1245), and lay them at once on 
a pastry-grate to dry for fifteen minutes. Dress them on a dessert- 
dish with a folded napkin, and serve. The remainder of the paste may 
be used the following day. 

1239> Fancy Almond Cakes. — Peel and pound half a pound of 
almonds as for No. 1207; then add two egg whites; when thoroughly 
pounded, put them into a vessel with ten ounces of powdered sugar, and 
the grated rind of a good lemon; then, with the hand, knead well together 
for twenty minutes. Slide a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 
1079), and pour in the above preparation. Cover a baking-sheet with 
brown paper, and holding the top of the bag with the right hand, guide 
the bottom with the left, and press the paste through onto the paper in 
small round bits one inch wide and half an inch high. Make ten of these, 
being careful to keep them one inch apart. Make ten more, shaped like 
the letter S, using the same quantity as for the others; then ten more, 
crescent-shaped, or like the letter C; and with the remainder of the paste 
make ten more, heart-shaped, being careful to keep them from touching 
one another. Take five candied cherries, cut them in halves, and arrange 
them on top of the round cakes; have twenty dried currants (No. 1080), 
and place one on each end of the S. Cut a candied apricot in two, and each 
half into five slices, and lay them on top of the crescents, and lastly have 
one ounce of candied angelica cut into very thin strips, and arrange them 
nicely on the heart-shaped pieces. 

It would be advisable to prepare these cakes the evening before they 
are needed, and lay them aside in a warm place over night. The next 
morning, glaze them lightly with beaten egg, using a pastry-brush, and 
place them in a brisk oven to bake for ten minutes. When of a nice brown 
color, remove, and let them become thoroughly cold. Lift them up care- 
fully with the paper, laying them gently upside down on a table, and 
with a wet towel moisten the paper, so that the cakes will detach easily. 
Turn the paper over immediately as it stood before, let rest for two min- 
utes; then remove the cakes. Lay them on a pastry-grate upside down, 
to allow them to dry for thirty minutes. Dress them on a glass stand 
with a folded napkin, and send to the table. 

1240. Pate-k-Chou. — Put into a saucepan two gills of cold milk and 
two ounces of butter. Place it on the range, stir slightly with the spatula, 
and when boiling, immediately add a quarter of a pound of well-sifted flour; 
stir briskly for two minutes. Then stand the pan on a table. Break in one 
egg ; mix sharply for two minutes , break in a second egg, mix sharply again ; 
and repeat with a third and a fourth egg; then the p^te-a-chou is ready. 

1241. Eclairs.— Arrange in a pastry-bag (No. 1079), a tube (No. 3); put 
into it the above quantity of pate-Sl-chou (No. 1240), and press out upon a 
baking-sheet fifteen Eclairs, each one three inches long. Bake them in a 
hot oven for twenty minutes. Remove, and let them cool; then with a 
pair of scissors open each 6clair on one side, and with a spoon fill the 
interiors with a crSme patissifere (No. 1242).

THE TABLE. 



1212. Creme Patissifere. — Put a pint of cold milk into a saucepan, and 
place it on the stove. Mix in another vessel two ounces of powdered 
sugar, with one ounce of flour, and half an ounce of corn-starch. Break 
in two whole eggs, and beat well together with the whip for two minutes. 
When the milk is boiling, add it to the preparation, and after stirring for 
one minute longer, put it into another saucepan, and place it on the stove. 
Beat well until it comes to a boil; then remove from the fire, and add 
immediately a teaspoonful of vanilla essence. Mix thoroughly again for 
one minute longer; then pour it into a bowl, and let it get cold. 

1243. How to Glaze Eclairs with Chocolate. — Put in a saucepan one 
pound and three quarters of granulated sugar and a gill of cold water. 
Place on the stove, and with a spatula mix well until the sugar is thor- 
oughly melted, and when boiling remove from the stove, and pour it 
gradually on a marble slab, on which it will spread about three feet 
square. Let it cool off for ten minutes. Then cut two ounces of cocoa 
Into small pieces; put them on a plate, and leave them at the oven door to 
melt. With a spatula begin working the sugar that is on the marble as 
rapidly as possible in every direction until it begins to whiten; then add 
the melted cocoa, mixing it thoroughly again until it becomes hard; 
remove the spatula, and detach the preparation quickly from the marble 
with a knife. Put it into a vessel, and covering it with a damp cloth, let 
it rest for thirty minutes. Then place half of it in a saucepan on the hot 
stove, and with the spatula mix thoroughly and slowly until it is luke- 
warm, meanwhile adding a teaspoonful of cold water. Take the Eclairs, 
one by one, and with the hand dip them into this preparation. Lay them 
on a, pastry - grate ; let then) cool oft for five minutes ; dress on a 
dessert-dish with a folded napkin, and serve. 

Keep the rest of the preparation for further use. When laid aside in 
a cool place, and properly taken care of, it will be as good in two weeks' 
time as when freshly made. 

1241. Eclairs au CafiS. — Have a p&te-^-chou ready, as for No. 1240; 
then proceed to make the Eclairs. Bake, and fill them with a crSme patis- 
si6re (No. 1242) exactly as for the chocolate feclairs ; glazing them the same 
as for No. 1243, only instead of cocoa use half a gill of coffee essence 
(No. 1263). Serve precisely the same. 

1245. Eclairs k la Yanille. — Prepare a pate-a-chou as for No. 1240. 
Make the Eclairs, bake, and fill them with a creme patissi^re, as No. 1242. 
Glaze them as for No. 1243, only substituting two teaspoonfuls of vanilla 
essence for the cocoa, and. serving them the same. 

1246. Chonx k la Creme. — Prepare a pate-4-chou as for No. 1240, and 
put it into the bag. Press it down onto a baking-sheet into six round, equal 
cakes, about two inches high. Glaze the surface of each with beaten egg. 
Bake in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. Watch them carefully, and 
when they are of a good golden color, remove from the oven and let cool 
for half an hour. Make. an incision on one side, about half-way in the 
cakes, using a pair of scissors. Fill the insides with crgme patissifere 
(No. 1242), and close them agaia. Dredge well with powdered sugar. 



DESSERTS. 



359 



and dress on a dessert-dish, with a folded napkin, before sending to the 
table. 

1217. Meringues. — Put six egg whites into a copper basin, with a 
light half saltspoonful of salt, and with a wire whip begin beating slowly, 
but gradually increase until a stiff froth is obtained. Should it become 
grainy, beat briskly again, adding half an ounce of powdered sugar. 
(Eight minutes should sufSce to have a proper froth.) Remove the whip. 
Have on a plate one pound of powdered sugar, and with a spatula drop 
the sugar slowly and carefully over the froth, mixing it in meanwhile 
with the spatula. This should take about two minutes. Flavor it with 
any desired flavoring, and it will be ready for use. 

1248. Apples, M^ringn^es. — Have six fine apples cooked as for No. 
Ii6g; dress them on a dessert-dish, filling the cavitie^ with currant jelly 
(No. 1326); then decorate all round and the tops with mferingue, prepared 
as for No. 1247, half the quantity being sufficient. Sprinkle them moder- 
ately with powdered sugar; lay the dish on a baking-pan, and put it in the 
oven for five minutes. When a light brown color, remove, and serve 
either hot or cold. 

1249. Small Fancy Meringues h la Ch. C. Belmonico.— Put into ^ 
sugar-pan one pound of granulated sugar with half a pint of cold water, 
and place on the hot stove. Have two quarts of ice- water in a vessel, 
and when the sugar comes to a boil, dip the fingers of the right hand into 
the ice-water and pass them quickly around the inside of the pan, and let 
boil for five minutes. Dip a wooden stick, similar to a pen-holder, in the 
ice-water, then quickly into the boiling sugar, and again in the ice-water, 
lifting up the stick to feel the sugar that adheres. Should it not be suffi- 
ciently consistent to form into a ball, let boil a little longer; then try once 
more; and should it be a proper thickness, remove from the fire and set 
it on the comer of the stove, so that it no longer boils. While the sugar 
is cooking, beat the whites of five eggs in a copper basin until they are a 
firm froth; and while beating, have an assistant pour very gradually the 
prepared sugar into the egg-froth ; and when all is added , lay the basin 
containing the preparation into a vessel half filled with ice-water. Remove 
the whip, and using a wooden spatula, mix gently for five minutes, add- 
ing a teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring. Cover the basin with a napkin, 
letting it rest for ten minutes. Butter and flour a baking-sheet; slide 
down a fancy tube (No. 3) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), fill it with the 
preparation, press down onto the baking-sheet, giving a C-shape, two 
inches long by one wide, to forty of them; and then forming twenty more, 
shaped like the letter D. Sprinkle them lightly with powdered sugar; 
place in a very slow oven, and let bake for fifteen minutes. When baked, 
these cakes should be perfectly white. Remove them from the oven, let 
get thoroughly cold; dress on a glass stand, and send to the table. 

1250. M6ringne-shells. — Prepare a mferingue as for No. 1247. Slide a 
tube (No. 4) down a pastry-bag (No. 1079); lay a piece of paper over a bak- 
ing-sheet, and after putting the meringue into the bag, press it out onto 
the paper, giving it an egg-shape, two and a half inches long by one inch

high. There will be enough to make eighteen equal-sized shells. Be 
careful to keep them one inch apart. Sprinkle over liberally with pow~ 
tiered sugar, and place in a very slow oven to bake thirty minutes. Re- 
move, and set to cool for twenty-five minutes. Then turn the paper con- ' 
taining the shells upside down on the table; and with a wet cloth or 
brush moisten well the paper; turn them over again, and let rest for two 
minutes, when the shells will detach easily. With the finger press them 
gently, one by one, in the bottom, into a. perfect shell-shape. Return 
them to the baking-sheet, laying them upside down, and put them in the 
oven to dry thoroughly for ten minutes; then leave them to cool for thirty 
minutes more. Keep them in a dry place, either in a tin or paper box, 
and use when required. M6ringue-shells prepared this way will keep 
nicely for at least twenty-five days. 

1251. Swiss M^rin^es Jl I'HelT^tieime. — Have a mferingue prepara- 
tion as for No. 1247; slide down in a pastry-bag (No. 1079) a tube (No. 4). 
Butter and flour a baking-sheet ; make on it one design eight inches in 
diameter ; another exactly the same shape, only six inches, and another of 
the same, only four inches. Put the meringue into the bag, and press it 
down gently over and around the first design, making the paste three- 
quarters of an inch thick ; repeat the same for the second and third forms. 
.Press down in the pan some more mferingue, making a little cone four 
inches high, two inches in diameter at the base, and tapering gradually to 
a point at the top. Sprinkle the whole lightly "with powdered sugar, and 
place the pan in a very moderate oven to bake for twenty-five minutes. 
Take it out, and let it thoroughly cool for half an hour. Have a quart of 
whipped crSme h. la vanille (No. 1254)^ add to it half a gill of Swiss kirsch 
and half a gill of maraschino, and with a pastry-whip beat the whole 
together for three minutes. Have read^ a round dessert-dish with a 
fancy paper over, detach carefully the largest form from the pan, lay it' 
on the dish, detach the second, lay it over the first, and fill the hollow 
space with half of the cream ; now detach the , third and smallest piece and 
lay it over the others, filling it entirely with part of the cream, and finally 
detach the cover, and arrange it nicely on the top. Pour the remaining 
cream into the pastry-bag containing the fancy tube, and with it decorate 
the places where the rings are joined. Then send to the table. 

1252. Crerae KenTersfe. — Put in a copper sugar-pan three ounces of 
granulated sugar with half a gill of cold water. Toss the pan briskly to 
melt the sugar well; then place it on the stove, and let it boil slowly until it 
becomes a light brown color. If a moderate fire, it will require four min- 
utes, but if a brisk one only two will suffice ; this will now be a caramel. 
Take( a pudding-mold holding one quart ; line the interior with all the 
caramel, holding the mold in the left hand, and spreading it evenly all 
round. Put the mold in a cool place, and let it become thoroughly cold. 
Have one pint of milk in a bowl ; break in four eggs, add a quarter of a 
pound of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of lemon essence. Beat well 
for five minutes ; strain through a sieve into another bowl, and fill the 
mold with this cream. Place it in a tin pan filled with water to half the 



DESSEJiTS. 361 



height of the mold, and place in a very moderate oven for forty-five min- 
utes. When of a good golden color remove, and cool for at least two 
hours. Turn it on a dessert-dish, and serve with its own juice. 

1253. Crfime eu Mousse aii Caf6.— Take a pint of whipped cream as 
for No. 1254, add three tablespoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263), and 
beat well together for five minutes. Transfer it to a china bowl, and put 
it in a cold ice-box. When ready to serve, use a spoon to drop the cream 
carefully upon the centre of a cold, round dessert-dish, keeping it as high 
as possible, shaping it into a pretty, artistic dome. Send immediately to 
the table. 

1254. Whipped Cream II la Tanille.— Put a pint of sweet cream into a 
basin. Have a tub or large dish-pan containing chopped ice and a little 
water, and lay the basin on top. With a soft wire egg-whip beat the 
cream slowly at first, and increase in swiftness until it is a firm froth. 
Sweeten with two ounces of powdered sugar, and add a teaspoonful of 
vanilla flavoring, beating constantly. Let it rest, and use when needed. 
Remove all the superfluous milk which may be found with the cream, 
before using it. 

1255. Creme en Mousse au fihunu — With a pint of fresh, sweet cream 
proceed as for No. 1254, adding a gill of rum, and beating well together 
for five minutes. Transfer it into a china bowl, and place in the ice-box 
until ready to use. When serving, have a cold dessert-dish, and with a 
wooden spoon drop the cream carefully into the centre of the dish, keep- 
ing it piled high as possible so to give it a pretty dome form, and send to 
the table immediately. 

1256. Creme en Mousse au Eirsch. — Proceed as for No. 1255, onty 
substituting a gill of kirsch for the gill of rum ; serve in the same 
manner. 

1257. CrSme en Mousse au Maraschino. — Prepared the same as creme 
en mousse au rhum (No. 1255), substituting a, gill of maraschino for the 
rum. 

1258. CrSme en Mousse au Cognac. — The same as for No. 1255, add- 
ing a gill of cognac instead of the rum, but serving the same way. 

1259. Cr6me en Mousse au Cura^oa. — Substituting a gill of curayoa 

for a gill of rum, and proceeding precisely the same "as for No. 1255. 

1260. Creme en Monsse. — To be prepared exactly the same, only 
using a gill of any other liquor desired, and serving the same as No. 1255. 

1261. Charlotte Russe il la Creme. — Take six small, round charlotte 
russe molds two and a half inches high, three inches in diameter at the 
top by two at the bottom. When thoroughly cleaned, line them with 
biscuits k la cuillfere (No. 1231), cut them in two, and should they be 
higher than the mold, trim them off to the edge. Pour the whipped cream 
(No. 1254) into a pastry-bag (No. 1079), and fill up the molds. Turn them 
over onto six dessert-plates, spread a little more cream on the top of each, 
and cover them each with one macaroon (No. 1210). Dress the refst of 
the cream nicely around the plates, and serve. 

1262. Charlotte Eusse au Caf^. — Line and prepare six small charlotte- 



362 Y ^^^ TABLE. 



molds as for the above (No. 1261), adding to the whipped cream two table- 
spoonfuls of coffee essence (No. 1263). Beat thoroughly together for two 
minutes, then fill the molds, and serve as for the above. 

1263. Coffee Essence. — Take one ounce of good, ground coffee; place 
it in a small saucepan with half a pint of cold water, and let boil until 
reduced to about two tablespoonfuls. Then strain through a cloth, press- 
ing it well, arid let cool thoroughly. Add it to the cream as described in 
No. 1262. 

1261. How to Cook Sngar. — Put into a sugar -pari one pound of 
granulated sugar, with half a pint of cold water; place it on a brisk stove. 
Have a vessel containing two quarts of ice-water, and when the sugar 
comes to a boil dip the fingers of the right hand into the water, and quickly 
pass them all around the inside of the pan, being careful to avoid touching 
the sugar; repeat this two or three times. However difficult this opera- 
tion may appear, it is essential that it should be done, in order to have 
the sugar in a perfect condition. Take care to dip the fingers into the ice- 
water each time. Let the sugar boil; then squeeze in three drops of 
lemon juice. To know when it is sufficiently boiled, have a thin piece of 
wood the shape of a larding-needle. Dip the point into the ice-water, and 
then plunge it into the boiling sugar; removfe it quickly, and dip it imme- 
diately into the water again. Lift it out, and see \fhether the sugar adher- 
ing to the wood be thoroughly hard. If not, let boil again, and continue 
to test with the stick as before. To be certain that the sugar is perfectly 
done, place the point of the stick between the teeth, and bite it. Should 
the sugar stick to the teeth, it needs more boiling, but if it cracks easily 
without sticking, it is thoroughly done. Remove it immediately from the 
fire, and place the bottom of the pan in the ice- water to prevent the sugar 
from turning brown. 

The above cooked sugar can be used for glazing dried fruits and candied 
fruits of all kinds; also to fasten on pieces of of nougat, and to make any 
kind of caramels, etc., etc. 

1265. Burned Sugar. — Put into a small iron omelet-pan half a pound 
of granulated sugar, and place on a slow stove, to burn thoroughly for, 
thirty minutes. Remove the pan to the table to cool slightly for. five 
minutes, and then add half a pint of boiling water, mixing well with an 
iron spoon. Replace the pan on the stove, and boil for five minutes, stir- 
ring continually ; then strain the sugar through a sieve into a vessel, and 
put in a cold place to cool thoroughly. Pour it into a bottle, and use 
when required. Burned sugar prepared this way will keep in perfect 
condition for several weeks. 

1266. Ifongat. — Have ready four ounces of peeled and dried almond 
(No. 1207). Cut eacH into four slices, and lay them in a tin pan with a 
sheet of paper under them. Put the pan in a warm place, but not on the 
stove. Take a copper sugar-pan, or dropper, put into it six ounces of 
powdered sugar, and place it on a hot stove ; then with a dry, wooden 
spatula stir continually, until the sugar is dissolved, being careful to avoid 
browning it. Remove from the fire, add one drop of lemon juice, and let 



£>£6SEJiTS. 36; 



it cool off slightly for three minutes, stirring constantly ; then add the 
almonds, mixing all gently with the spatula for two minutes. The nougat 
(s now ready for use, and can be molded into cornets-d'abondance, columns, 
bases, or any shape the fancy may dictate. 

1267. Small Pyramid of Nougat.— Oil slightly the interior of a 
small, round base. Take half the nougat, prepared as for No. 1266, 
(ay it on a marble table (the nougat should always be hot), roll it out very 
thin with an oiled roller, and with this line the oiled base. Then with a 
whole lemon sharply press the nougat onto the mold to give it a perfect 
form, cutting it evenly away all around the edge. Put the pieces with 
the rest in the pan, and place near the fire to keep hot. Have a small 
comet-d'abondance (cornucopia), oil it slightly, and line the inside with half 
the remaining nougat, rolled out as before, and pressing it the same. Cut 
away all the superfluous part, and let it cool slightly. Then unmold both 
the base atjd cornet. Oil a tartlet-mold, and line it with the rest of the 
nougat. Lay the base carefully upon a glass stand of suitable size, the 
covered part uppermost, and fasten to the stand with cooked sugar (No. 
1264). With cooked sugar fasten the cornet in the middle, small end 
uppermost, using cooked sugar for the purpose. Put the remaining 
piece from the tartlet-mold on top of all, and fasten it in the same way. 
All this should be done carefully and patiently. Have ready two well- 
peeled, sound oranges, pull them gently to pieces, looking closely at each 
separate section to see that the skin is not broken or loosened. Have a 
quarter of a pound of fresh Malaga grapes, detach them, leaving on each 
grape about a quarter of an inch of stem. Take also two ounces of candied 
cherries, plunge the grapes into the cooked sugar (No. 1264), and with a 
fork lift them up, and immediately lay them on a well-cleaned, oiled, 
marble table. Treat the pieces of orange and the cherries each the same 
way. During this time, should the sugar become cool, heat it up once 
more ; fill the cornet with these fruits, dipping one side of each piece into 
the cooked sugar to make them adhere together. With a part of them fill 
the tart-shaped piece on top, proceeding in the same manner, and decorate 
with glace royale (No. 1269). 

1269. Glace Boyide. — Put the white of one egg into a small bowl. 
Beat it well with a small spatula, adding six ounces of extra fine sugar, 
and squeezing in three drops of lemon juice. Then continue beating for 
twenty minutes. When finished, it should be snow-white and pulpy. 
Make a small brow^n paper cornet, cut off the lower end, slide down a 
small fancy tube, and pour in some of the glace royale, covering the 
remainder of it with a damp cloth. Then with the cornet decorate the 
edge of the nougat base as in the preceding (No. 1268), also the upper 
edge, and all around the edge of the cornet, and finish by decorating 
artistically the tart-shaped piece on top; then send it to the table. 

All nougat pieces, when finished, should be kept in a moderate 
temperature. 

1270. Blanc-manger h, la Josephine Delmonico. — Peel neatly six 
ounces of sweet almonds and two ounces of bitter almonds (No. 1207). 



364 THE TABLE. 



Put in a vessel, cover with cold water, and let them soak for fully one 
hour. Drain thoroughly through a sieve, and pound them well in a 
mortar, adding, little by little, a gill of cold water, and continue pounding 
for ten, minutes. Now remove to a vessel and add two gills of lukewarm 
water, and mix together with the spatula for two minutes. Spread a 
large napkin over another vessel, pour on the above preparation, lift up 
the four corners, and holding it with the left hand, squeeze the liquid 
through with the right. Lay this almond milk aside for further use. Put

boil slowly for four minutes. Remove it froni the fire, and let the pan 
rest on the table for three minutes. Pour in the almond milk,,mix again 
for two minutes, using the spatula, and strain the whole through a fine 
sieve into another vessel. , Have a. three-pint, channelled blanc-manger 
■mold; put some broken ice at the bottom of a pail, place the mold on it, 
arranging more broken ice around the sides, so that the mold be entirely 
sunk in the ice as far up as the edge. Stir the preparation for one minute, 
then pour it into the mold, cover the pail with a napkin, and leave it to 
congeal for one hour. Take up the mold carefully from the pail, wipe off 
the ice with a towel, and have ready a cold dessert-dish with a folded nap- 
kin over. Turn but the blanc-manger onto this ; decorate the surface with 
two ounces of candied cherries and one ounce of angelica, and it is ready

whole into a copper basin, placing it on a moderate stove to heat for five 
minutes, stirring at the .bottom continually with the spatula, and being 
careful not to let it boil. Remove from off the fire, place it on a table, and 
add immediately one pint of sweet cream, still mixing it for two minutes 
more; let cool off for thirty minutes, then strain through a sieve into an 
ice-cream freezer; put on the lid, and lay it in an ice-cream tub, filling the 
freezer all round witli broken ice, mixed slightly with rock-salt; then turn 
the handle on the cover as briskly as possible for three minutes. Lift up 
the lid, and with a wooden spoon detach the cream from all around the 
freezer, and the bottom as well. Re-covdr it, and turn the handle sharply 
for three minutes more; uncover, and detach the cream the same as before, 
' being careful that no ice or salt drops in. Put the lid on, and repeat the 
same three times more. The ice-cream should by this time be quite firm, 
so h^ve a cold dessert-dish with a folded napkin, dress the ice-cream over, 
and send to the table. 

This same ice-cream can be formed into a single brick by having a 
brick-shaped form, filling it with the cream, and pressing it down quickly

lemon water-ice (No. 1279); let them remain in the freezers. "^Put four 
ounces of candied cherries onto a plate, cut them in halves, and add two 
candied apricots cut into small pieces. Take six tutti-frutti molds, open 
one of them, and lay on the cover a spoonful of strawberry ice-cream, 
with a spoonful of the lemon water-ice, one beside the other, press the 
sixth part of the candied fruits onto the ice-cream in the cover of the 
mold, filling the bottom with vanilla ice-cream, and close together firmly. 
Lay it immediately into a pail with broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, 
cover the mold slightly with more" ice and salt, then proceed to prepare 
the other five molds exactly the same. When they are all in the pail and 
covered as the first one, fill it up entirely with broken ice and salt, and let 
it freeze for one hour. Have a vessel containing warm water ready at 
hand, and prepare six small dessert-plates with a small fancy paper on 
each, lift up the molds, one. after the other, wash them off quickly with 
the warm water, and unmold, the tutti-fruttis onto the cold plates, and 
serve. 

1294. Plombiere a la Kingman, — Put together into a saucepan eight 
egg yolks, half a pound of powdered sugar, a piece of vanilla-bean one 
inch long and split in two, also a pint of sweet cream, and six ounces of 
finely grated cocoa. Mix well with the spatula for two minutes, then 
place the pan on the hot stove, and stir constantly while heating, but 
under no circumstances must it boil. Remove it from the fire, and lay 
the pan in a cool place on the table for thirty minutes. Put an ice-cream 
freezer into a tub, fill it all round with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, 
remove the cover, and after wiping the freezer well, strain the prepara- 
tion through a sieve into it, cover it again, and with the hands turn the 
handle of the cover for five minutes in opposite directions. Lift up the 
cover, and with the spatula detach the preparation that aidheres to the 
sides, readjust the cover, and turn again the handle, beginning in an 
opposite direction from the first time ; after five minutes, detach from the 
sides as before, and repeat for the third time the turning process. Finally 
lift off the cover, and detach the cream from all around, and it will now 
be'thoroughly firm, so cover it again, and let it rest. Beat up to a froth 
one gill of sweet cream as for No. 1254 ; take a glass or silver stand, and 
with an ice-cream spoon remove the cream from the freezer, spoonful by 
spoonful, and dress it in the centre of the bowl, keeping it as high as pos- 
sible, and giving it a pretty, pyramid shape. Fill a paper cornet with the 
whipped cream, cut off the point, and decorate artistically the top and 
sides of the plombifere. Chop up very fine two ounces of pistache, and 
sprinkle them evenly over the surface, then send to the table. 

1295. Parfait an Caf6 k la Parisienne. — Place six ounces of powdered 
sugar in a saucepan with six egg yolks and a pint of sweet cream, and 
mix well together for two minutes ; set the saucepan on the hot stove, 
then stir gently and continually from the bottom, using a. spatula, until 
nearly coming to a boil ; as this is difficult to determine on account of the 



DMssEnrs. 371 



briskness of the fire, the best way to tell when it is sufficiently done is to 
lift up the spatula and see whether the cream adheres thickly to it, if so, 
remove the saucepan from the fire and lay it on the table, add immedi- 
ately to it four ounces of freshly roasted Mocha coffee in beans, then stir 
again well for one minute more. Remove the spatula, cover the sauce- 
pan with a napkin, put the lid on, and let infuse for one hour. Beat up 
■one pint of fresh sweet cream as for No. 1254, and let rest until needed. 
Place an ice-cream freezer in a tub, fill it up all round with broken ice 
mixed with rock-salt, wipe the cover nicely, and then remove it ; strain 
the infused preparation through a fine sieve into the freezer, put on the 
cover, then take hold of the handle, and turn the freezer briskly in oppo- 
site directions for five minutes ; remove the cover, and with the spatula 
detach all the cream that adheres to the sides and bottom, recover, and 
turn sharply as before ; remove the cover, detach the cream from the 
sides and bottom, replace the cover, and begin turning again 'in opposite 
directions for five minutes longer. The cream should now be thoroughly 
frozen. Drop the whipped cream into the freezer, very little at a. time, 
meanwhile mixing it gently with the spatula, which should take four min» 
"utes to accomplish it; then have ready a three-pint, channeled, ice-cream 
mold, and with an ice-cream spoon fill the mold with the preparation, and " 
put on the lid. Place some broken ice with rock-salt at the bottom of a. 
pail, lay the mold over, and fill up the pail with more ice and salt, then 
let freeze for fully one hour. Afterward remove the mold, dip it into 
lukewarm water, wipe away the ice and salt, and lift it up immediately, 
take off the cover, and turn the cream onto a cold dessert-dish with ^ 
folded napkin, and serve. 

1296. Rice and Cream h la Croce. — Put one pint of cold milk into a 

saucepan, adding one pint of cold water and half a saltspoonful of salt, 
place the pan on the hot stove, and when boiling, throw in four ounces of 
well-cleaned, raw rice; then with a spatula stir slowly and continually at 
the bottom while it is cooking for twenty-five minutes, then take the pan 
from off the fire, lay it on a table, and add immediately four ounces of 
powdered sugar and one ounce of fresh butter ; mix well together with a. 
spatula for two minutes, then transfer it into another vessel, and. set it in 
a cold place for one hour to have it thoroughly cooled off. Whip to a 
froth one pint of sweet cream as for No. 1254, cover the basin with a nap- 
kin, and let rest for twenty minutes ; should there be any milk settled at 
the bottom, pour it off, and add to the cream two ounces of powdered 
sugar and one teaspoonful of vanilla flavoring, then with a wire whip beat 
well together for two minutes longer, and remove the whip. Take the 
rice from the vessel, drop it gradually into the whipped cream, then mix 
the whole together slowly and carefully for three minutes. Line a two- 
<iuart, tin melon-fofm with three ounces of peach marmalade (No. 1331), 
fill the mold with the preparation, put on the cover, and after placing a 
little broken ice at the bottom of a pail, lay in the mold, and cover it 
entirely with broken ice (no salt is necessary for this), and let freeze for 
one hour. Have a vessel with two quarts of lukewarm water ; lift up 



572 THE TABLE. 



the mold from the pail, dip it into the water, wash off the ice, and raise 
it up immediately ; remove the cover, turn the preparation onto a cold 
dessert-dish, and send to the table. 

1297. Oranges Olac^es h, la George Benauldt.— Have six fine, solid 
oranges, and with a pastry-tube, one and a quarter of an inch in diameter, 
cut off the tops of the oranges, then with a small knife remove the covers 
gently, laying them aside until later. With either a Parisian-potato cutter 
or a spoon, empty the insides of the oranges, being careful to avoid 
breaking any of the skin, for should that occur, they will be useless ; the 
interiors can be used for some other purpose. Arrange the oranges, with 
their covers on, in a square biscuit-glacfe box as for No. 1286 ; place the 
box in a tub, filling it with broken ice mixed with rock-salt, and let freeze 
for one hour. Prepare a champagne punch as for No. 1307, and with it 
fill the interior of the oranges, put on the covers, and with different col- 
ored ribbons tie each one, beginning at the top ; when at the bottom, turn 
the ribbon and bring it back to the top inian opposite direction, then make 
a graceful bow on top of the covers. Lay them again in the box, and let 
them freeze for one hour longer, then dress them on a dessert-dish with 
a folded napkin, and serve. 

1298. Mac^doine Glac^e ^ la CaTOUr. — Prepare a pint of lemon ice- 
cream as for No. 1278, also a pint of coffee ice-oream (No. 1273), leaving

half the lemon ice-cream at' the bottom, arrange a third part of the fruits 
nicely over, dividing them equally, then covei; with half of the coffee ice . 
cream, and with a spoon press it down well. Lay half the remaining 
fruits on top of this, and spread over the rest of the lemon ice-cream, 
then the last of the fruits, and fill up the mold with the balance of the 
coffee ice-cream. Close very firmly, and lay it into a pail with broken ice

Beat up in a basin two egg whites, and add them to the other ingredients, 
then grate in a saltspoonful of nutmeg, adding six cloves, and one bay- 
leaf, mixing well with the whip for one minute. Have ready a seamless 
jelly-bag (which can be purchased ready made), tie it on a jelly-stand, or 
if none handy, two kitchen chairs will answer the purpose. Stir the

preparation, and when coming to'a boil, set it back to a cooler part of the 
stove to prevent it overflowing; stir, while boiling, for six minutes. Place 
a vessel under the jelly-bag, remove the pan from the fire, and pour the 
whole into the bag, immediately adding to it half a pint of good sherry 
wine, and a teaspoonful of burned sugar(No. 1265). Let it drain into the 
vessel, then return it to the bag, placing another vessel underneath, then 
let it drain through, for fully two hours. Have a quart jelly-mold, pour 
the jelly from the vessel into it, and set it aside in a cool place for two 
hours, then put it into the ice-box to harden for two hours more. Prepare 
a cold dessert-dish, and after dipping the mold lightly and carefully to 
near its edge in lukewarm water, take it up immediately, and turn it onto 
the dish, wiping neatly the latter all around, then send to the table. 

1319. Eirsch JeUy. — This jelly is to be prepared the same as the

1326. Currant Jelly.^Select sixteen pounds of. small, old Dutch cur- 
rants, not too ripe; those are preferable which are picked at the end of 
the month of June. Place them in a copper basin on the hot stove, 
and begin stirring them immediately from the bottom, using a wooden 
spatula; when they begin to scald, pour them into a clean tub, and with a 
pounder mash them thoroughly. Strain them through a.flannel jelly-bag 
back into the copper basin, adding to the juice seven pounds of granulated 
sugar. Return the pan to the fire, and let boil until reduced to about half 
the quantity, then dip in a skimmer, lift it up, and feel the jelly with the 
two forefingers; close them, and open them slowly, if the jelly is 
mucilaginous, then it is done; if not, cook for a few minutes longer. 
Take it from the fire, and pour a little into every glass jar ready to use, 
as this will prevent them cracking. Afterwards fill them up. When

thoroughly cold, which will be in about two hours, during which time 
they must not be disturbed, cork them tightly, and put them in a closet. 
Currant jelly prepared in this way will keep in good condition for two 
years. 

1327. Apple Jellj. — Put six good-sized apples into a saucepan after 
cutting them into quarters ; add a pint of cold water and a quarter of a 
lemon, then placo.it on a hot stove, and let boil for fifteen minutes. Place

into a sieve over a yessel, and press well through with a wooden spoon. 
Transfer it into a stone jar, and use when required. 

1330. Stewed Prunes Ji la G^n^ral Dufour.— Procure ten ounces of 
the best imported prunes (which should invariably be purchased at £ 
responsible dealer's), and put them in a vessel with a quart of cold water, 
letting them soak for four hours; then thoroughly drain them. Put them 
in a saucepan with half a pint of cold water, the zest of a sound lemon, 
a two-inch-length piece of cinnamon, two ounces of fresh butter, and four 
ounces of powdered sugar. Place the pan on a slow fire, and with the 
spatula stir carefully and gently once in a while, to avoid breaking them. 
After letting them cook slowly for two hours, remove the pan from the 
stove, and add immediately a pint of Bordeaux wine, replace it on the 
stove to heat thoroughly, but not allowing it to boil again ; take from off 

"the fire, pour the prunes into a stone jar, let get cold, then serve. 

1331. Peach Marmalade. — Peel and cut into slices twelve good-sized, 
sound peaches ; put into a saucepan half a pound of granulated sugar and

'^yS THE TABLE. 



each apple into four quarters, and lay them in a saucepan with a pint of 
cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. When the contents 
of the pan come to a boil, skim well, and then flavor with the juice of 
half an orange, or the same quantity of lemon, and a saltspoonful of 
ground cinnamon can also be added. When flavored, let cook for five 
minutes longer, and with a spatula stir slowly from the bottom to avoid 
mashing the apples. Remove from the fire, pour into a china bowl, and 
cool off thoroughly before serving. 

1333. Stewed Pears. — Are ,to be prepared and cooked exactly the 
same as for the above (No. 1332). 

1334. Stewed Peaches. — Peel and cut into quarters ten medium-sized, 
sound, ripe peaches, removing the stones, put them into a saucepan with 
a pint of cold water, adding half a pound of granulated sugar. Place the 
pan on the stove, and when boiling skim well ; let cook for five minutes, 
meanwhile stirring them slowly from the bottom, to avoid mashing the 
fruit; then remove, and immediately add a gill of kirsch, mixing well 
together for about half a minute. Pour into a china bowl, let get cool, 
then dress on a dessert-dish, and serve. 

1335. Stewed Apricots. — Peel, cut, and stone twelve good-sized apri- 
cots, or fifteen if they be small; then proceed to prepare them exactly as 
for stewed peaches (No. 1334), only substituting a gill of brandy for the 
kirsch. 

1336. Stewed Green-gages. — Have eighteen or twenty solid, ripe, 
green-gages, peel them neatly, cut them in halves, and stone them. Pro- 
ceed exactly the same as for stewed peaches (N0.1334), only replacing the 
kirsch by a gill of red cura9oa, and serving the same. 

1337. Stewed Plnms.— Proceed exactly the^same as for the above (No. 
1336), substituting the same quantity of plums for the green-gages. 

1338. Stewed Quinces. — Take twelve fine, firm, ripe quinces, peel and 
core them thoroughly, then cut them into quarters, and put them in a 
saucepan with a pint of cold water and half a pound of granulated sugar. 
Place them on the stove; when boiling, skim well, and let cook for fifteen 
minutes, stirring them gently at the bottom with a spatula to avoid mash- 
ing the fruit. Remove from the fire, and immediately add a gill of 
maraschino; stir lightly again, then pour into a china bowl to let cool. 
Dress on a dessert-dish and serve. 

1339. Symp for Preserving Fmits. — Put seven pounds of granulated 
sugar into a sugar-pan, adding five pints of cold water, and when on the 
hot stove, stir with the spatula until thoroughly heated, but it must not 
boil. Remove it from the fire, lay it aside, and use when needed for 
different fruits. The above quantity will produce five quarts at thirty 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

1340. Preserved Peaches. — The best variety for preserving are- 
either the " Crawford Late," or " Smoker^' Select one hundred thoroughly 
ripe, sound, medium-sized peaches; peel them neatly, cut them in halves, 
and remove the stones, with care. Have ready ten patent lightning-glass 
jars, each holding one quart, or twenty holding only a pint each; then divide 



DESSERTS. 



379 



the peaches equally into them, and pour into each one pint of syrup 
prepared as for No. 1339, or half a pint, if using the pint jars, taking care 
that the peaches floating on the top should be entirely covered, even if it 
be necessary to press them down lightly. Put on the cover very tight, 
then bring the larger wire up in the very centre between the two small 
knobs, and press the smaller one downwards. Place the jars in a. large 
saucepan standing, seeing that they do not touch each other, otherwise 
they might break, and arrange a little hay or straw between every one. 
Fill the pan with cold water so as to cover them entirely, and placing it 
on the hot stove, let boil for ten minutes. Take from off the fire, stand 
the pan on a table, and with a towel lift up the jars one by one, laying 
them most carefully on a dry kitchen table, and avoid putting them in a 
cold place. When all are so arranged, taking the towel into the hand, lift 
up the smaller wire, so that the gas slightly escapes for one minute, then 
immediately pull it down again until hermetically sealed. Let them stand 
till thoroughly cold, then put them away for general use. The right 
temperature for keeping them is from 65 to 75 degrees. Should the sauce- 
pan not be sufficiently large to contain all the jars, boil five at a time. 

The best time to select the peaches is from August 20 to Sep- 
tember 20. 

1341. Preseired Bartlett Pears. — Procure one hundred medium-sized^ 
sound, and fully ripe pears, fit to eat in their natural state ; peel them 
carefully keeping them in their original form, then split in halves, and cut 
out the cores and seeds. Fill ten lightning-glass jars with the pears, 
and pour over five quarts of syrup (No. 1339), covering them tightly the 
same as for the peaches (No. 1340), placing them likewise in the saucepan, 
but boiling for fifteen minutes instead of ten. When lifted from the pan, 
proceed precisely as for ■ the peaches. The best time to purchase the 
fruit is from August 25 to September 20. 

1312. Preserved Apples. — Select sixty medium-sized, fine, sound, ripe 
Newtown pippins, the best time for this being from October i to Decem- 
t)er I. Peel and core them with a corer, then cut them into quarters, 
and divide them equally into ten glass jars as for peaches (No. 1340). 
Fill them up with the syrup at thirty degrees, then cover tightly, put 
them in the saucepan exactly the same as for the peaches, and boil for 
fifteen minutes instead of ten. Take from off the fire, and finish the same 
as for the peaches, putting them away in the same temperature. 

1313. Preserred Egg-plums.— Have two hundred medium sized egg- 
plums, ripe enough to break easily from the stones ; wash them care- 
fully, drain, then divide them equally into the ten quart lightning-jars. 
Fill them up with the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), cover tightly, and 
arrange them in the pan precisely as for peaches (No. 1340). Boil them 
for eight minutes instead of ten, then take from the stove, and finish pre- 
paring them exactly as for the peaches. The best time to procure these 
is from August 5 to September i. 

1311. Preserved Green-gages.— Procure two hundred and fifty fine, 
ripe green-gages, selecting those which break easily from the stones ; 



380 THE TABLE. 



wash them well in cold water, drain thoroughly, then divide them equally 
into the ten patent glass jars, exactly as described for peaches (No. 1340). 
, Fill up with five quarts of thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), ^nd finish pre- 
paring them the same as for peaches, but boiling them only for eight 
minutes instead of ten ; put them away the same as the other fruits. The 
best time to procure green-gages is from August i to September i. 

1345. Preserved Strawberries. — Always purchase the buries from 
June 7 to July 20, when residing in New York. Have fully the 
equivalent of ten quarts of well-picked and thoroughly washed, ripe, 
sound, and perfect strawberries, drain them well. To have these well 
selected it will doubtless require twenty-two to twenty-five quart baskets 
of unpicked fruit. When well drained, fill the ten quart lightning-glass 
jars with the berries, and pour in the thirty-degree syrup (No. 1339), but 
using it hot instead of cold. Cover them tightly, and proceed precisely 
the same as for peaches (No. 1340), only boiling them five minutes instead 
of ten, and putting them away the same. 

1346. Preserved Raspberries. — Have ready . the equivalent of ten 
quarts of fine, ripe, solid, well-washed, and thoroughly drained raspber- 
ries ; sixteen quart baskets will be about the necessary quantity to pur- 
chase. When ready, fill up the ten lightning-glass jars, and proceed to 
prepare them as explained for peaches (No. 1340), the only exception 
being that they must be boiled five minutes instead of ten. The proper 
time to obtain the berries is from July 10 to July 20. 

1347. Preserved Cherries. — Purchase twenty-five pounds of fine, 
sound, ripe, white wax cherries ; pick off the stems neatly, and should 
there be any unripe or spoilt ones among them, throw them away, as 
they would likely ruin the rest. When finished, there should be about 
twenty pounds of sound cherries suitable for preserving. Have ready 
ten quart lightning-glass jars, same as for the peaches (No. 1340); divide 
the picked cherries evenly into them, and fill up with the thirty-degree 
syrup (No. 1339). Cover them tightly and carefully, then arrange them 
in a large saucepan precisely the same as the peaches, and finish them 
exactly as described in that number, boiling them for the same length of 
time. June 15 to July i is the best time to obtain the fruit. 

1348. How to Boast Coffee. — If practicable, procure a small family 
coffee-roaster. Have three quarters of a pound of Java, mixed with a 
quarter of a pound of Mocha, place it in the roaster, and taking one of the 
lids from off the stove, put the roaster on a moderate fire, and turn the 
small handle constantly and slowly until the coffee becomes a good brown 
color; for this it should take about twenty-five minutes; open the cover to 
see when it is done, then transfer it to an earthen jar, cover it tightly, and 
use when needed; or, a more simple way, and even more effectual, is to 
take a tin baking-dish, butter well the bottom, and placing the same 
quantity of coffee therein, put it in a moderate oven to let get a. good 
golden color; twenty minutes will suffice for this, being careful to toss it 
frequently with a wooden spoon, then remove to an earthen jar. and cover 
it well. 



DESSEHTS. 381 



Roasting one's own coffee is a sure way of having it always fresh; 
besides, it retains its full flavor; but care must also be taken to purchase 
coffee from a responsible, first-class dealer. 

1349. How to Make Black Coffee. — Take six light tablespoonfuls of 
coffee-beans from the jar (No. 1348); grind them in a mill, neither too 
coarse nor too fine. Have a well-cleaned French coffee-pot, put the coffee 
on the filter, with the small strainer over, then pour on a pint and a half 
of boiling water, little by little, recollecting, at the same time, that too 
much care cannot be taken to impress on those making the coffee, the 
necessity of having the water boiling thoroughly, otherwise it were as 
useless to attempt the feat as to try and raise musk-melons at the North 
Pole, notwithstanding that the coffee be of the very first quality. When 
all the water is consumed put on the cover, and let infuse slightly, but on 
no account must it boil again; then serve in six after-dinner cups. Coffee 
should never be prepared more than five minutes before the time to serve. 

1350. Caf6 Noir k I'Alexander the Great. — Put in an earthen pot on 

the hot range three pints of cold water; when boiling, immediately add 
four and a half ounces of freshly ground coffee, and as soon as the coffee 
has been added, put the pot on the corner of the stove to rest for three 
minutes. Have a piece of hot, red (very red) charcoal the size of a small 
banana, plunge it into the coffee. (If no charcoal at hand, a piece of red 
stove-coal will answer). Let rest again for three minutes; then you will see 
a heavy foam appearing at the surface of the coffee, thoroughly skim it off 
with a skimmer. Then carefully and gently pour it into a hot coffee-pot, 
and send to the table with six small, hot demi-tasses; accompanied with 
six ponies of old Renauldt cognac. 

I would recommend that, after the scum has been removed, the coffee 
should be handled as gently as possible, so that all undesirable elements 
will remain at the bottom. 

1351. Caf6 au Lait (Coffee with Milk).— Have a clean French coffee- 
filter ready on the hot range; place in it four and a half ounces of freshly 
ground coffee, as for No. 1349; then gradually pour over it, all around, 
half a pint of boiling water; let rest for three minutes, then gradually 
pour over two pints and a half more of boiling water (taking special care 
that, under no circumstances, should it be allowed to boil again after the 
water has been poured over). When all dripped down, pour it into a hot 
coffee-pot. Take three pints of good, freshly and thoroughly heated milk 
(but do not boil it), pour it into a hot pitcher, send to the table with six 
hot cups i cafiau lait, pouring into each cup half coffee and half milk. 

1352. Caf6 au Lait k la St. Gottardo.— Place in an earthen pot on the 
hot range two quarts of very fresh milk, and let it heat until near the boiling- 
point, then immediately add two and a half ounces of fresh, finely ground 
coffee (No. 1349). Shuffle the pot in contrary directions until it comes to 
a boil; then let it rest for three minutes. 

Strain it through a clean napkin into a hot serving-pitcher, and serve 
with six caffe-au-lait cups. 

1353. Caf6 GI11C6 ticed Coffee).— Prepare one quart of coffee as for 



382 THE TABLE. 



No. 1349, and also one quart of thoroughly heated «4nilk (not boiled). 
Pour both coffee and milk into a small ice-cream freezer. Sweeten with 
three tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; tightly cover the freezer, place 
it in a tub containing broken ice and rock-salt a little higher than the 
height of the coffee, then sharply, turn it by the handle of the cover, in 
different directions, for five or six minutes; neatly wipe the cover of the 
freezer all around to avoid that any ice should fall in; and with the aid of 
n. ladle pour it into a pitcher, and serve with six coffee-glasses, and 
powdered sugar separately.- 

1354. Th6 (Tea).— rPlace in a tea-pot three heaped tablespoonfuls, or 
one and a half ounces, of the best English-breakfast tea, purchased from a 
' responsible dealer. Pour over five pints of boiling water. See to it that 
the water is boiling, else, even with the best quality of tea, you will never 
succeed to have it made to perfection. Let infuse for five minutes (but 
do not boil again), then send to the table with a pint of cold milk, or a 
pint of sweet cream. 

Th6 GIac6 (Iced Tea). — Prepare the same quantity of tea the same as 
above, pour into an ice-cream freezer, sweeten, and proceed the same as 
for iced coffee (No. 1353), (omitting the nrilk); pour it into a cold pitcher, 
and send to the table with six coffee-glasses, six slices of sound lemon, and 
powdered sugar separately. 

1365. Th^kla Bnsse (Russian Tea). — Place in a tea-pot three heaped 
tablespoonfuls of English-breakfast tea; pour over a little boiling water, 
just sufficient to cover the tea, about two tablespoonfuls ; let infuse for 
one minute, then draw the water out, but do hot use it. Pour in half a 
pony of good old Jamaica rum and three pints of boiling water; let infuse 
for four minutes, and then serve in cup with a decanter of old Jamaica 
rum separately, thin slices of lemon, and powdered sugar. 

This is the old Russian style. Later fashion is to flavor it with a little 
vanilla flavor and a few drops of lemon juice. 

1356. How to Make Chocolate. — Select three quarters of a pound of 
good chocolate (Maillard's is preferable), break it into pieces, and put 
them in a saucepan on the stove with half a pint of boiling water ; stir 
well with a wooden spoon, and when the chocolate is thoroughly dis- 
solved pour one quart of boiling water over, using a quart of milk instead 
of the water when chocolate and milk is desired. Let it cook well for ten 
minutes, then serve. 

1357. Chocolat au Lait & la George Washington.— Have a stone pot 
on the hot range with half a pint of cold water. Break in six tablets of 
one ounce each of Maillard's chocolate, sharply mix with a very clean 
wooden spoon or spatula until it is thoroughly dissolved ; then add two 
quarts of good cold milk, thoroughly heat until it comes to a boil, mixing 
lightly with the wooden spoon meanwhile. Pour it into a hot pitcher, 
and send to the table with cups and powdered sugar separately. 

A pinch of salt represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

Half a pinch of pepper represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 

A third of a pinch of nutmeg represents 13 grains, or half a teaspoonful. (

SUPPLEMENT. 



1358. Lobster ik la Rushmore. — Select three fine, fresh lobsters, each 
weighing two pounds; boil them in salted water for ten minutes, then 
take them out and put to cool for eighteen minutes. Pick out all the 
meat, leaving the main body-shells intact for further use. Mince up the 
tail-parts, coral, and claws into pieces a quarter of an inch thick by three 
quarters of an inch wide. Put a sautoire containing half an ounce of fresh 
butter on the hot stove; chop up very fine one good-sized, sound shallot, 
add it to the butter in the pan, also the minced lobster, and season with a 
light pinch of salt, a. light saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and half a 
glassful of good white wine; let the whole reduce for ten minutes, stirring 
it meanwhile with a wooden spoon. Add one tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), four tablespoonfuls of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and 
six mushroom-stalks chojS^ed up very fine. Let cook well for ten minutes 
longer, then set the sautoire on the corner of the stove to keep warm. 
Take the three main shells of the lobsters, split them evenly in two, 
lengthwise, pare the ends off neatly, wash them thoroughly, and wipe 
them dry. These shells should not be longer than four and a half inches. 
Fill the six shells with the prepared lobster, lay two mushroom heads on 
top of each, put them on a tin plate and pour over the remainder of the 
sauce in the sautoire. Set them in the hot oven to bake for five minutes, 
then remove and dress them on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and send 
to the table. 

1359. Raw Hambnrg Steak. — Chop up two pounds of beef the same 
as for cooked Hamburg steak (No. 526), only selecting more tender pieces, 
and return it to the machine two or three times so as to have it finer. 
Season with one large pinch of salt, half a pinch of pepper, and the third 
of a pinch of nutmeg. Place the meat on a dish, divide it into six small, 
flattened steaks, and throw a raw egg yolk over each one; garnish with 
two shallots, one tablespoonful of parsley, the same quantity of capers, 
and three anchovies, all finely minced, aftd arranged in clusters around the 
dish. 

1360. Mignons of Lamb, Sance B^arnaise.— Procure a fine, tender leg 
of lamb, bone it with a sharp knife so as to detach the meat from the 
knuckle, beginning from the hip-side downwards. Cut out from this six 
even pieces or steaks, one inch thick by two and a half in diameter, pare 
them nicely, and with a small, keen knife remove any sinews that are 
liable to adhere to the meat. Lay them on a cold dish, and season with a 
good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper, and roll them well, so that 



384 THE TABLE. 



the seasoning be equally distributed. Put half an ounce of good butter 
in a frying-pan, set it on a brisk fire, and add the pieces, or mignons, im. 
mediately, being careful that they do not lay one on top of the other, and 
cook them very briskly for two and a half minutes on each side. Prepare 
half a pint of Bearnaise sauce (No. 166), pour it on a hot serving-dish, 
dress the six mignons nicely over, one overlapping the other, and send to 
the table immediately. 

Any lamb that may be left over after cutting off the mignons can be 
utilized for minced lamb, soup, or any other purpose desired. 

1361. Hind-quarter of Spring Lamb. — Procure a medium-sized, fine, 
white hind-quarter of lamb ; pare it neatly, trim' the small handle-bone, 
and fold the flank over the ribs, to prevent them being overdone; that 
means that the leg and ribs will be equally cooked the same' length of 
time. Tie it well together, then season with one and a half pinches of 
salt divided evenly, and envelop it well in its caul or leaf-fat ; lay it in a 
roasling-pan, pouring in one tablespoonful of broth or water, then place 
it in a moderate oven, and let roast for one hour, basting it occasionally 
with its own -dripping. Take it from the oven, remove the caul, untie, 
and dress it on a hot dish, adjustirig a neat paper ruffle to the handle- 
bone. Skim the fat from oflE the ^gravy, strain the latter over the lamb, 
and serve. 

1362. Chicken, 8ant6 il la CIi. C. Delmonico. — Select from a good 
poultry-dealer two fine, tender Philadelphia spring-chickens weighing 
two pounds each. Singe them over a. little alcohol poured onto a plate, 
draw the entrails, wash well the interiors, then wipe them dry with a 
clean cloth. Cut each chicken into I'.-x. pieces, place them in a sautbire 
with two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, season with a good pinch of salt and 
i?ne pinch of pepper, then set the sautoire on a very brisk fire, and let 
cook until the pieces assume a good, light brown color (ten minutes will 
suffice), stirring them lightly in the meanwhile. Chop up very fine. one 
sound shallot ; cut one green pepper into small, dice-shaped pieces, also 
the end part only of a medium-sized, peeled carrot ; place all these with 
the chickens, and let cook together for one minute and a half, then add 
one glassful of good white wine, atid let the liquid reduce to one-half, 
which will take ten minutes on a brisk fire, stirring it occasionally. Now 
add one gill of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), a tablespoonful of tomato 
sauce (No. 205), the juice of a good-sized, very sound lemon, and a quar- 
ter of an ounce of fresh butter ; let all cook for ten minutes longer, stir- 
ring it lightly with a spoon. Plunge three canned artichoke-bottoms into 
very hot water, lift them up immediately with a skimmer, wipe them 
thoroughly dry with a napkin, then cut each one into four quarters ; slice 
three medium-sized trnflSes very fine, and add all these to the chickens 
two minutes before serving. Dress the chickens and sauce on a very 
hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruffles to the ends of the four legs ; gar- 
nish the dish artistically with the artichokes star-shaped. Place a slice of 
truflSe on the centre of each artichoke, and a very small, round slice of 
Spanish sweet pepper on top of each truflSe, and send to the table very hot. 



SUPPLEMENT. 385 



1368. Chicken, SanW il la Ranhofer.— Select two fine, tender chickens 
■weighing two pounds each ; singe tliem well, draw the entrails, wash 
thoroughly, and wipe very dry; then cut each chiclsen into six pieces, and 
season them with a good pinch of salt and a light pinch of pepper. Place 
the pieces of chicken in a. sautoire with three quarters of an ounce of 
good butter and half a tablespoonful of sweet oil, and set it on a very 
hot stove. Chop up one shallot very fine, and one sound, green pepper 
cut in small, dice-shaped pieces ; when the chickens are of a Jight brown 
color, add the shallot and pepper, and stir well for one minute; then add 
a wine-glassful of good white wine, and let reduce to one quarter, which 
will take six minutes. Pour in one gill of tomato sauce (No. 205) and one 
and a half gills of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), and let cook rather slowly 
for ten minutes longer, stirring it occasionally. Dress the chickens and 
sauce on a very hot serving-dish, adjust paper ruffles on the ends of 
the four legs, and decorate the dish with the following garnishing : take 
six canned artichoke-bottoms, spread a tablespoonful of Duxelle (No. 215) 
in the centre of each one ; empty the interiors of six fine, sound, medium- 
sized green peppers, cooked in the oveij for five minutes, stuff them with 
Duxelle garnishing (No. 189), and arrange them on top of the artichokes, 
their thin part uppermost, so as to give them a pyramidal shape; then 
lay them on a buttered tin plate or dish, and set them in a slow oven to 
bake for five minutes ; remove them, but while they are baking cut out 
six round pieces of fresh bread, half an inch thick by two and a half 
inches in diameter ; place them on a hot stove in a frying-pan with half 
a tablespoonful of butter, and let get a light brown color for two minutes. 
Arrange the six artichokes and peppers ';n top of the pieces of bread, 
garnish the dish nicely, and send to the table at once. 

1364. Filets Mi^ons k la Lorillard. — After preparing six timbales 
as described below, and when removed from the oven, have ready six 
fine filets mignons as for No. 509, and serve with the following garnish- 
ing and sauce: take six small timbale-molds, measuring one and three 
quarter inches in diameter and two inches deep ; butter well the insides, 
and set them in the ice-box to get thoroughly cold. Have one medium- 
sized, cooked carrot, also one cooked turnip; cut them both with a tube a 
quarter of an inch in diameter by one inch long ; have also half a 
medium-sized, fine, white cabbage, and trim the outer leaves neatly. Put 
into a stewpan one ounce of salt pork cut into small dice-shaped pieces; 
add the cabbage, and season with half a pinch of pepper ; set the pan on a 
rather slow fire, cover it tightly, and let cook slowly for thirty minutes, 
without removing the lid ; during this time decorate, the six cold timbales 
by laying a slice of truffle, half an inch in diameter, at the bottom of each, 
and just in the centre, and with the aid of a larding-needle arrange a row 
of cooked green peas around this, then decorate half the interior of each 
timbale with half the prepared carrots and turnips, using the utmost care, 
and, keeping rhem inclining slightly toward the right, and the other half 
inclining toward the left. Fill up the timbales with the cooked cabbage, 
using a spoon to press it in gently, so that they are filled entirely as far 
2S 



386 THS TABLE. 



as the top. Put them on a roasting-pan, filling it with hot water to half 
the height of the tirabjiles, then place them in a hot oven, and heat from 
three and a half to four minutes. Take them from the oven, and leave 
the pan on the corner of the stove to keep warm. Cut an oval-shaped 
slice from an American loaf of bread, one inch in thickness, pare the edges 
neatly, then butter it lightly, and place it in the oven on a tin plate to get 
a light brown color; two minutes will be sufficient for this; lay it on a 
very hot dish, and dress the six filets mignons on top of the bread 
croustade, each one lengthwise and slightly overlapping one another, and 
so on until all are used. Pour over the mignons half a pint of hot Colbert 
sauce (No. igo), to which add whatever parings or pieces of trufl3e 
remain, one minute before using; then with a towel remove the timbales 
from the pan, one after the other, turn them upside down, unmold, and 
with these decorate the dishj placing one at each end and two on each 
side, then send to the table immediately. 

It would be advisable to prepare and cook the fillets after, the timbales 
are removed from the oven. 

1365. Flageolets Sautes au Benire. — take three quarters of a quart 
can of fine, French flageolet beans, parboil them in boiling and lightly 
salted water for one and a half minutes, then drain them on a colander, 
and place them immediately in a saucepan on the hot stove with an ounce 
of good butter ; season with a teaspoonful of salt, and shuffle lightly 
with a wooden spoon while cooking for three minutes, and when serving, 
add half a teaspoonful of finely chopped parsley. Dress them on a hot 
dish, and serve. 

1366. Eggs k la Post. — ^Wash and scrape neatly one good-sized, sound 
carrot, then, with a vegetable-scoop, scoop out twelve round pieces; place' ■ 
them in a sautoire with one gill of white broth (No. 99), and a teaspoon- 
ful of good butter. Cook them on the hot range for twenty minutes. 

Place twelve fine, sound, roasted, and shelled Italian chestnuts 
into the sautoire with the carrots, let come to a boil. Remove all the 
skin from two uncooked sausages. Make twelve equal balls out of it, 
place on a tin plate, and bake in the hot oven four minutes. Remove, and 
add them to the carrots and chestnuts. Season with a light pinch of salt 
and the third of a saltspoonful of red pepper; add one gill of Madeira sauce 
(No. 185). Cook for two minutes longer. Have a silver dish sufficiently 
large to contain twelve eggs so that they do not touch one another. 
Place in the centre of the dish half a pint of hot pur6e of chestnuts (No. 
131), then arrange twelve fried eggs over the puree prepared the same 
as in No. 412. Carefully and equally divide in clusters around the disK, 
the carrots, chestnuts, and sausage balls, then pour the sauce around the 
eggs with a spoon, but none over the eggs. Place on top of each egg 
one thin slice of truffle cut with a tube. Place in the hot oven to heat for 
one minute. Take from out the oven, and serve. 

1367. Oysters Fried \l la Arthur SnUiTaii. — Carefully open thirty

SUPPLEMENT. 387 



medium-sized fine, sound lemon, cut into thin slices, one sprig of thyme, 
a small bay-leaf, and a branch of well-washed parsley. Place on the hot 
range, and heat up very fast without boiling, for which, on a very brisk 
fire, it should be done in one minute and a quarter; then place- the whole 
in an earthen bowl to cool. 

Beat up one raw egg in a bowl with one gill of cold milk, seasoned 
with a light pinch of pepper and a light pinch of salt; steep the oysters in 
this, one by one, then lightly roll them in cracker-dust; give them a nice 
even shape in the palm of the ^hand, and lay them on a dish. Heat up 
thoroughly in a frying-pan on the hot range one gill of clarified butter 
and half a gill of olive oil (it must be very hot before placing in the 
oysters), and fry them for one minute on each side. Remove them with 
a skimmer, dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and serve with the 
following sauce separately: 

Strain the juice of the oysters into a saucepan, and reduce it to one 
half on the hot range, with half a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding also 
the juice of half a sound lemon and a gill of sauce Espagnole (No. 151). 
Cook for three minutes, add a teaspoonful of chopped chives, pour it into 
a sauce-bowl, and send to the table. 

1368. Lobster Salad k la Boardman. — Split lengthwise two very fine 
medium-sized, freshly boiled, and cooled lobsters; pick all the meat out 
from the shells, as well as from the cracked claws, suppress both intes- 
tines and pouch. Cut the meat into very small, equal, square pieces, and 
place them in a salad-bowl. Finely chop up, as fine as hashed potatoes, 
three hard-boiled eggs; add them to the lobster. Peel and chop, also very 
fine, two small, sound shallots, and add to the lobster, with one and a half 
teaspoonfuls of very fine freshly chopped chives and one and a half tea- 
spoonfuls of finely chopped parsley. Chop also, very fiiie, one root of 
thoroughly pared and well-cleaned sound celery (using nothing but the 
perfect white), add it to the lobster. Season with a light tablespoonful 
and a half of salt, a teaspoonful and a half of fresh, finely crushed white 
pepper, half a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, a tablespoonful and 
a half of olive oil, two tablespoonfuls of very good white vinegar. Mix 
well, then add three tablespoonfuls of freshly made mayonnaise sauce 
(No. 206). Gently but thoroughly mix the whole well together; wipe 
neatly the edges of the salad-bowl with a napkin. Plant right in the 
centre a branch of parsley-greens, and send to the table. 

1369. Game Pie ^ la Levi P. Morton. — Take one fine partridge, one 
grouse, and one medium-sized rabbit ; pick, draw, and singe well. Thor 
oughly bone them. Place the fillets in a saucepan with one tablespoonful

blade of thyme. Cook all together with one ounce of butter until it has 
obtained a light brown color; then ^d one glassful of Madeira wine, 
half a medium-sized, sound lemon cut in slices, one quart of white broth 
(No. gg), and two ounces of gelatine. Let cook one hour. Then strain 
through a napkin or a fine sieve into a china bowl, and lay aside to thor- 
oughly cool. Chop up very fine a quarter of a pound of lean, raw veal, a 
quarter of a pound of fresh pork, and six ounces of larding-pork. Season 
with one good pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper. Cut into dice- 
shaped pieces eight truffles, three ounces of cooked smoked beef-tongue; 
mix well together, and it will be ready for use. Knead well together, on a 
marble table, wooden board, or in a vessel, half a pound of flour with four 
ounces of butter, then gradually add a gill of cold water, mixing well until 
it is a perfect dough, for five minutes at least without ceasing. Then place . 
it in a cool place, and let rest ten minutes before using. Lightly butter the 
interior of an oval-shaped mold ten inches in length, six inches wide, and 
four and a half high. Place the mold in an iron roasting-pan. Roll out 
three-quarters of the dough to one-quarter of an inch thick, and with it 
evenly lin? the inside of the mold, taking special care not to make any holes 
in the dough. Cut some very thin slices of larding-pork, and line the dough 
all around with it. Then place one layer of the forcemeat and one layer of 
the game, and so on, until all is used. Make a hole with a teaspoon right 
in the centre down to half the depth of the patty (pS,t6). Roll out the other 
quarter of dough to the same thickness, quarter of an inch; cut a cover 
out oval-shaped, ^and with it cover the p^^^, making a small hole in the 
centre to connect with the other. Decorate the surface with leaves made 
out of the dough, glaze It with the yolk of one fresh egg and half a gill of 
cold water. Place in a moderate oven to cook for two hours. Remove from 
the oven. Put away in the ice-box for six hours. Take the pie from the ice- 
box, melt the prepared jelly, and then fill the game-pie through the hole 
in the centre ; then return it to the ice-box, and let thoroughly cool for at 
Idast two hours, and it will be ready to serve. N. B. — The jelly should 
never be poured intb the pie until it is perfectly cooled ofiE. 

1370. Flombiere & la Hamilton. — Beat up one and a half pints of 
sweet cream, as in No. 1254. Let it rest for half an hour. Neatly pick 
one and a half pints of sound, ripe strawberries ; carefully wash them in 
cold water, then drain them on a colander. Transfer the whipped cream 
into another vessel with a skimmer. Briskly beat the cream again for 
two minutes. Mix in three ounces of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of 
vanilla flavor, and half a gill of cognac. Mix the whole well together for 
one minute longer. Remove the wire whip, add the prepared strawber- 
ries, and with the aid of a wooden spoon gently mix for one minute. Pour 
the preparation into a well-cleaned, two-quart ' freezer, cover, and lay it 
into a pail; fill the pail all around with broken ice (but no rock-salt), and 
let freeze for one hour. Have a fruit-stand ready, then with an ice-cream 
spoon dress the plombifere on the stand, giving a dome shape, and imme- 
diately send to the table. The above makes a delicious dessert, also, 
when served without being frozen. 

1371. Tatti-friltti h, la G«n. Harrison.— Line the interior of a three- 
pint melon-form with a pint of vanilla ice-cream (No. 1271). Cut four

cherries into halves. Mix these together. Evenly spread half thte quan- 
tity of the fruits all around the ice-cream in the form. Carefully arrange 
a pint of raspberry water-ice (No. 1281) evenly around the fruits. Spread 
the balance of the fruits all around the water-ice ; then fill the form with 
a pint of pistache ice-cream (No. 1275). Tightly cover the form. Lay it 
in a pail with a layer of broken ice and rock-salt at the bottom, and then 
fill up to the surface with the same. Let freeze for one and a half hours. 
Unmold the tutti-frutti ; dress on a 'glass stand, and serve with the fol- 
lowing sauce : put in a vessel a pint of whipped cream (No. 1254) with 
two ounces of powdered sugar and a gill of maraschino. Beat the whole 
well together for two minutes. Pour it over the tutti-frutti, and immedi- 
ately send to the table. 

1372. Frogs' legs ^ la MerrilL — Neatly pare off the claws of half a 
pound of very fine, fat, fresh frogs' legs. Cut them into pieces at each 
joint. Place them in a saucepan on the hot range, with half an ounce of

17 and July I. After filling the cans, cover with a light syrup, seal up, 
and bathe five minutes, open vent, close, and put away. 

1379. Currant Jelly. — The best jelly can only be made before the cur- 
rants are fully ripe — between June 25 and July 3. After scalding the 
currants well, press them through a flannel bag, and while the juice is 
hot, boil six or seven pounds of the best crushed sugar with one gallon of 
juice, watching closely until it attains the proper consistency; then pour 
in molds to cool. 

Another way to make a very delicate jelly is to boil one gallon of juice 
about ten minutes, and while boiling hot stir in eight pounds of granulated 
sugar, and keep stirring until all dissolved, then pour into molds. 

1380. Raspberries. — The best time is between July 5 and 15, and pro- 
ceed same as strawberries. 

1381. Blackberries and Whortleberries between July 15 and August 
15. After carefully washing the berries, put on any degree of, syrup you 
wish, as this fruit will make pies or do for the table. Seal up, and cook 
eight minutes; open vent, close, and put away. 

1383. Peas, Corn, and Lima Beans are so hard to keep that it is im- 
possible for a family to put them up. They require a greater heat than 
boiling water, and have to be cooked in a super-heated steam chest. 

1383. Eg^-plnms and Oreen-gages are best when nearly ripe — be- 
tween August 15 and September i. After filling cans cover with a 
twenty-five-degree syrup and cook ten minutes, then open the vents, close 
and put away. 

1384. Tomatoes. — Between August 15 and September 15, select 
thoroughly ripe tomatoes, scald them about two minutes in hot water, so 
that the skin will peel off very thin to leave the perfect shape of the fruit; 
then fill the cans as full as you can press them in; seal them and cook 
twenty minutes, then put away. 

1385. Peaches and Bartlett Pears. — Last of August to last of Septem- 
ber, select ripe fruit; pare carefully; fill cans and cover with a twenty-five- 
degree syrup; seal up, cook twenty minutes, then open vent, close and 
put away. 

1386. String Beans are best in October. Select the small refugee 
beans; after taking strings off, wash and scald well; then fill cans with 
whole beans, and cover with a light brine. Seal up; cook one half hour, 
then open vent, close again, and cook three fourths of an hour more, then 
put away. 

1387. Apples. — Newtown pippins are the best about November 15. 
Pare and quarter; take cores out; then fill cans and cover with any 
strength syrup required. Seal up, and cook five minutes, open vent, 
close and put away. 

Six pounds of the best crushed sugar to a gallon of water will make 
a syrup of twenty to twenty-five degrees. 



SUPPLEMENT. 



391 



1388. Tenderloin Broil il la Staiiton.— Prepare three fillets exactly as 
in No, 503, and one minute before they are cooked, lightly devil them on 
both sides ; then broil half a minute on each side. 

Chop very fine one small, well-peeled, sound shallot, place it in a small 
saucepan on the hot range with a teaspoonful of butter, fry for one min- 
ute; then add half a glassful of good white wine, and reduce to one half. 
Add one medium-sized, sound pickle, and one sweet pepper cut into small 
dice-shaped pieces. Season with half a pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful 
of red pepper; add half a gill of Spanish sauce (No. 151). Cook for one 
minute rather briskly, then pour the sauce on a hot serving-dish, dress 
the fillets over it; arrange six hei.^'t-shaped croutons (No. 133) around the 
dish, place a slice of truffle on top c ' each croiiton, then a round slice of 
Spanish sweet pepper, cut with a tul(' over each slice of truffle, and send 
to the table. 

1389. FUets Miguons k la Brown. — Chop very fine one medium-sized, 
sound, peeled shallot, place it in a small saucepan on the hot range, with 
a teaspocmful of very good butter; heat well for one minute without 
browning; add half a wine-glassful of good Madeira wine, boil for two min- 
utes, then add half a teaspoonful of freshly chopped tarragon, one good-sized 
sweet pepper cut in small dice-shaped pieces, twelve stoned and stuffed 
olives, six whole mushrooms, and one artichoke-bottom, cut in dice- 
shape, also a gill of sauce Espagnole (No. 151). Season with half a 
pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Cook for three min- 
utes and a half, then pour this garnishing on a hot serving-dish. Nicely 
dress over it six freshly cooked mignons filets as in No. 509, one over- 
lapping another; decorate the dish with six heart-shaped croiitons (No. 
133), and serve. 

1390. Broiled Grouse k la Pomeroy. — Prepare and broil three fine, 
tender grouse, precisely the same as for No. 854, but one minute before 
they are cooked, lightly devil them, and then gently broil again for half 
a minute on each side. 

Place in a small saucepan on the hot range one medium-sized, sound, 
peeled, and finely chopped shallot, with a tablespoonful of good butter; 
cook for one minute, then add two chopped mushrooms, one chopped 
pickle ; moisten with a tablespoonful of English sauce ; add a light tea- 
spoonful of English mustard; mix all well together. Season with half a 
pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of red pepper. Cook for one minute 
and a quarter. Pour the sauce on a hot serving-dish, place the grouse 
over it, decorate the dish with six slices of broiled bacon (No. 754), six 
thin half slices of lemon; arrange six slices of truffles in the centre of the 
slices of lemon, and serve very hot. 

1391. Mazagrran k la General Bngeau.— This will be found a. superior 
and pleasantly stimulating summer beverage for ladies, as well as for the 
sterner sex. 

Prepare the same quantity of coffee as in No. 1349. Have six goblets 
half filled with clean ice, pour in the coffee, evenly divided; add a pony 
of good cognac to each glass, mix thoroughly with a teaspoon, and serve. 



392 THE TABLE. 



The above is a delicious and healthful after-dinner summer dirink, and 
is enjoyed in nearly all the large cities of Europe, especially by military 
men, who prefer it to the usual after-dinner demi-tasse, or " gloria,'' as 
they call it in Paris. 

The name is derived from the village of Mazagran, Province d'Oran, 
Algeria, famous for a long and heroic siege in 1840, virherein one hundred 
and twenty-three French soldiers were victorious against twelve thousand 
Arabs. 

1392. Maza^an \ la General Dufonr. — The same as above, only sub- 
stituting a pony of Swiss kirsch instead of cognac. 

1393. Smelts k la Van Yolkenburgh. — Wash well, and thoroughly 
dry, eighteen fine, fresh Long Island smelts. Split them right along the 
backbone in the centre; remove the backbone of each. Season with a 
pinch of salt and half a pinch of pepper; sprinkle them with half an ounce 
of flour, then place them in a pan with one ounce of good butter on the hot 
range, and fry for two minutes on each side, or until they obtain a good 
light brown color. Dress them on a hot dish; place in a pan one ounce of 
good butter, fry it until it becomes of a good nut-brown color; add to it a 
tablespoonful of vinegar, then pour over the smelts; decorate the dish all 
around with parsley-greens, and serve. 

1394. Tomatoes wth Kice & la Watson. — Wash in cold water six fine, 
red, sound, equal-sized tomatoes, wipe them dry, then cut off the top of 
each tomatp (keeping them on a plate until needed); remove the seeds of 
the tomatoes with a vegetable-scoop. Season the inside of each with half 
a pinch of pepper and half a pinch of salt. 

Place them in a well-buttered pan. Place two ounces of well-picked 
rice in a cup or in a dish, add to it one teaspoonful of melted butter, 
half a medium-sized, sound, peeled, and finely chopped shallot; season 
with half a pinch of salt only, mix all well together, then put into 
each tomato one teaspoonful of rice; place the tops on as a cover, sprinkle 
a little clarified butter over, and then cover them with a well-buttered 
paper. Bake them in a moderate oven for thirty minutes. 

Thoroughly wash six large, fresh mushrooms. Cut off the stalks, chop 
up very fine half a sound, peeled shallot, as well as the mushroom stalks, 
place in a pan with a tablespoonful of good butter and two drops of lemon 
juice. Season with half a pinch of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper. 

J;ook five minutes, without browning, then add the mushroom-tops, with 
alf a. glassful of Madeira wine; reduce for two minutes; add now half a 
gill of demi-glace (No. 185); let cook for five minutes longer. 

Dress the tomatoes on a hot serving-dish, place one head of mush- 
room on top of each tomato, upside down, pour a little of the sauce over 
the six mushrooms, find the rest on the dish around the tomatoes; arrange 
a thin slice of truffle on top of each head of mushroom, and send to the 
table. 



irOW TO CARVE. 39;: 



HOW TO CARVE. 



The art of cookery and carving is an old one. During^ the Roman 
Empire it was taught by professors in the schools, and had at that time 
attained a high standard. France leads all nations in the art of cooking 
and carving, although the United States is not far behind in this respect. 

Good cooking and carving go hand in hand. It is no trifle to prepare 
and cook a good dinner; but it is an easy matter to spoil the effect, if not 
the entire dinner, by negligent carving. 

The first and most important factor is ^ strong and very sharp knife. 

Chickens. — Lay the roasted chicken (of three to four pounds) on its 
side. Stick your fork into the leg and lift it up, meanwhile holding down 
firmly the rest of the chicken. Then cut through the joint on the back; 
pressing the joint between the leg and second joint, cut through. 
Stick your fork into the wing so as not to interfere with the knife; cut 
through the joint and loosen the meat surrounding it; pull down with the 
fork and press firmly on the carcass with the knife. If done carefully, you 
can pull all the meat from the .breast with the wing. Then cut each breast, 
crosswise, in half. Turn around, and proceed as in the first operation. 

Turkey. — ^Cut away the leg the same as with a chicken. The leg of a 
turkey being larger than that of a chicken, it would be advisable to cut 
into slices the leg and second joint. After the leg is cut off, stick your 
fork into the breast-bone; hold the fork firmly with the left hand; then, 
with the sharp knife in your right hand, starting from the outside of the 
breast, proceed to cut, carefully, thin slices, until you reach the bone. 
Then turn, and proceed the same as before. 

Serve each person with a piece of the dark and a slice of the white meat. 

Should the turkey be stuffed, plate a little of the stuffing on each plate. 
A capon, large chicken, or English pheasant should be carved the same way. 

Partridges. — In America only the breasts of the birds are generally 
eaten, the legs being strong and bitter. Stick your fork straight into the 
breast-bone; cut one slice from the outside breast; then cut close along- 
side of the breast-bone and around the wing, carefully pushing all the meat 
from off both breasts, one after the other. 

Grouse. — The grouse is generally carved the same wayas the partridge. 

Canras-back Dack. — The " King of Birds." — The breast only is 
carved, served, and eaten. Stick the fork straight and firmly into the 
middle of the breast-bone. Commence from the neck down to the back, 
straight to the back-bone, and around the back; then from the point of 
starting, around the collar-bone. Cut the joint from off the wing. Com- 
mence cutting again from the point of starting; carefully and gently 
carving off the whole breast, so that no meatTemains. Proceed precisely 
the same with the other side. When finished, there will remain only the 
carcass. 



394 



THE TABLE. 



Red-head, black-head, mallard, teal, &c., are carved the same as the 
canvas-back. 

Tame duck, duckling, goose, &c. , are carved as a chicken, unless they 
are over four or five pounds, then they should be carved the same as a 
turkey or a capon. 

For small birds, such as squab, snipe, plover, woodcock, &c., no carv- 
ing is necessary, as they are generally served whole. 

Saddle of Mntton, Lamb, or Tenison should always be carved — 
especially for private families — lengthwise first, on both sides of the spinal 
bone, then crosswise downward. Special care should be taken to stick 
the fork right in the centre of the saddle, and holding it firmly while carv- 
ing with a very sharp knife, and keeping as near the bone as possible, till 
down to the end on both sides. When all detached, cut it crosswise into 
small pieces of about half or three-quarters of an inch thick, and serve. 

Steak. — Sirloin steak can be carved in various ways — crosswise, 
lengthwise, in small or large pieces, as desired. 

When serving, the cut part should always be laid uppermost. I would 
suggest, though, carving it diagonally into six fine, even slices, till you 
reach the fat part. When carved this way it makes it look inviting, and 
has a beautiful effect. Always place a small piece of the fat on each plate 
when serving. 

Tenderloin, or Fillet, — Fillet is carved straight, in as many pieces as 
desired, but when serving, the cut part should always be served the same 
as the sirloin, uppermost. 

Boast Beef. — As soon as the rib-beef is roasted to perfection, as men- 
tioned in No. 527, remove it from the hot oven, place it always on a hot 
dish, with the rib-bones downward ; should it be crusty on top, cut o£E 
just a little from the surface, which is generally so hard that often it is an 
impediment in cutting the slices to the desired perfection. Stick in the 
fork-tines lengthwise, on top of the roast, near the edge, in a slanting 
manner, so as to avoid pricking the lean part of the roast and the result- 
ing loss of juice or blood; hold firmly the fork with the left hand, and with 
a large, sharp knife in the right hand, carefully cut, in even, small slices 
a quarter of an inch thick, right down to the rib-bones; gently make a 
cut underneath, so as to have each slice separate from one another; 
then serve. 

Boasted Leg of Mutton. — If practicable, when carving a leg of mutton 
a patent handle should be adjusted to the end bone, which would be a sub- 
stitute for the fork, and an avoidance of soiling the hands at the same time. 
Begin carving small, thin, even slices, about quarter of an inch in thick- 
ness, straight or diagonally down to the bone, till you come to the end 
bone, then lengthwise underneath to the end. On account of the much 
thinner meat on the other side of the leg, carve it diagonally, and serve 
one piece from each side. ' 

Boasted Leg of Lamb.— ^Is to be carved exactly the same as the leg 
of mutton.

^ ]V[ E N TJ ^ 

FROM 

I 

Central Africa. 



Through the courtesy of a gentleman who has for many years lived 
in Central Africa, and who has brought with him a young prince, son of 
one of the powerful chiefs of the Baaili tribe, to be educated in ^this 
country, the author is enabled to illustrate the habits and customs noir in 
vogue in the Royal Kitchen there. 

As a rule, there is only one principal meal, which is eaten in the early 
part of the evening. It mostly consists of parrot-soup, roasted or stewed 
monkeys, alligator eggs (also well liked by Europeans), and birds of every 
description. They also have moambo or palm-chops, and fish. A great 
delicacy, so considered by Europeans and natives alike, is elephant's 
feet and trunk. They have somewhat the taste of veal, and have a very 
delicious flavor. To prepare them they dig a hole, about five feet deep, 
in the sand, and build in it a large fire. After the sand is thoroughly 
heated, the fire is removed, leaving only the ashes in the hole. They 
place the trunk and feet in this hole, covering them with leaves, and 
afterward with hot sand; they remain there about two hours, when they 
are considered done. 

All carcasses of animals which are to be cooked, are placed on a block 
of wood, and pounded until every bone is broken, care being taken not to 
tear or bruise the skin. They are then boiled or roasted on an open wood- 
fire, in hot sand or ashes, without removing the hide or feathers. 

The cooking is of a very inferior grade ; the only spices used being 
salt and pepper. 

The kitchen utensils consist of common earthen or wooden ware. 

Very little time is taken for setting or decorating the table; knives, 
forks, napkins, &c., &c., are dispensed with. 

All victuals are served in large wooden vessels. After the members of 
the chief's household and his guests have assembled, each person is sup- 
plied with a wooden spoon, and selects whatever he wishes out of the 
different vessels, using his hands in eating it. 

In the line of vegetables, they have also several dishes well liked by 
Europeans. N'gutti-N'sengo is a dish eaten all over Africa, It consists 
of egg-plant, small fish, somewhat like our sardines (N'sengo), and the 
roots of the cassava or manioca plant (called N'gutti), which have a 
knotty appearance, and often weigh as much as twenty pounds. 

As the latter contains poison, they soak the manioca in water for three 
to four days, to extract the poisonous substance. They are cut and 



414 "^H^ TABLE. 



sliced, adding small tomatoes. All is placed in a vessel with water, and 
seasoned with salt and pepper, and boiled. Moambo, or, as the Europeans 
call it, palm-chops, is also a favorite dish. The palm-nuts are first boiled 
in water, until the pulpy substance loosens from the pit. 

Then the shell, which contains a very delicious oil, is placed in a 
wooden mortar and crushed to obtain the oil. Then whatever the meal 
consists of, meat, fish, mussels, &c., all is put in a vesse], adding the oil 
and the pulpy part of the palm-nut, also red pepper and salt, and is boiled. 

Roast or boiled squash (Loeng;e) is generally eaten with it. 

Sweet potatoes (M'balla Benga) are more farinaceous, and sweeter than 
ours, but do not taste so good. They are boiled or roasted in the same 
way as we do here. 

Bananas (Bitaebe) weigh about a half pound each, and are about fifteen 
inches long. When half ripe they are cut in slices, adding much salt and 
pepper, and are boiled in water. 

N'sensi is a little red bean, which is boiled in water without adding salt 
or pepper. 

Peanut bread (Chisulu): the peanuts are first roasted, then crushed. 
This mass is then rolled and put into the skin of a banana, adding a little 
pressure, forming it into a body. It readily retains this shape from the 
presence of the oily substance in the peanut.

As to the Chinese, at their formal dinners or feasts no menus are 
used. The bill of fare consists of an interminable list of dishes, and 
which has been arranged by the author in the form of a menu card. The 
tables are laden with such dishes as shark-fins, bSche-de-mer fish, fish- 
soup, chicken-soup, duck-soup, rice, rice, rice, and tea, tea, tea, and tea ; 
not forgetting the edible birds' nests, candies, and cakes. One's appetite 
is almost taken away on entering a Chinese house at which a banquet is 
to be given— the effect of burning incense and other vile herbs. The 
Chinese can be extremely polite. Champagne is a favorite drink among 
Chinese officials at the Treaty Ports, and is always brought out when 
they have a foreign guest.

A most delicious sauce, called "Shoyu," which is the basis of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, is also used to give spice to the food. Throughout 
the repast the guests are served from time to time with " Saki," a pale 
liquor made from rice, and which tastes very much like sherry. It is 
served hot, and is a most insinuating tipple. In a large party you are 
expected to exchange cups and drink with every one present. The result 
is that, in.nine cases out of ten, you leave the house just a " wee bit fu'," 
as they say in Scotland. Like the Chinese, no knives, forks, or napkins 
are used — " chop sticks" only. To smack your lips or belch during the 
feast is, strange to say of such a supremely polite people, not considered 
bad form.

In Corea Chinese fashions are very closely followed. Greasy messes 
and appetite-destroying smells are their most characteristic features. 
The food is always conveyed to the mouth by the aid of " chop sticks," 
and during the progress of a meal the mind becomes catered to by an 
animated conversation.

Among the Kanakas, the food eaten for breakfast, luncheon, and dinner 
is about the same, and consists chiefly of the native dish called "POI," 
which is eaten whenever they (the Kanakas) are hungry. 

"POI" is made from a root called "Taro," and in shape and size 
resembles a raw beet, it has a dark skin, and the vegetable itself has a. 
variety of colors — pink, gray, purple, and white. 

The " Taro " is cooked in the ground, after the manner of a " New 
England clam-bake;" after obtaining the softness of a cooked potato it is 
peeled, and beaten with a large stone or iron, made for that purpose, into 
a pulp. It is then mixed with water until it forms the thickness of paste 
(and which makes very good paste, as it is often used for sticking tills, 
etc., when a theatrical company arrives), and after standing for a few 
days, to allow it to ferment, it is ready to be eaten. 

The "Poi" is always eaten out of a "Calabash" (a large gourd 
about the size of a pumpkin), the natives always eating with their fingers, 
this being done by sticking the two fore-fingers into the " Calabash," 
giving it one or two twists, and dexterously turning it around in front of 
their faces, until it looks like a ball of "taffy on a stick" (no pun 
intended). 

" Taro " is sometimes cooked and eaten like potatoes and is consid- 
ered very wholesome food. 

The next important dish is "Haw Fish,'' which are caught along the 
coast and eagerly eaten by the natives. Fish is also cooked in the 
ground, and is served on large leaves about the size of palm-leaves, 
called "Ti" leaves. Raw meat, raw liver, and a. fragrant sea-weed forn\ 
delicate side-dishes. 

Coffee, within the last few years, has to a great extent been drunk as 
a beverage, but not so much as the Hawaiian tea, which tastes and smells 
like medicine. 

Vegetables are also eaten, but sparingly, comprising sweet potatoes, 
Irish potatoes, cabbages, etc. 

Fruit, the product of the Islands, is very much eaten and relished, 
such as guavas, mangoes, bananas, mountain-apples, oranges, etc. 

The Hawaiians when eating always sit on mats. All eat out of the 
same calabash. After eating, it is the custom to pass the pipe of friend- 
ship, which is a small pipe made from shark's teeth.

SECOND SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 



A WORD OF EXPLANATION. 

A WORD or two in regard to the uses for which this work has been 
especially designed might not be amiss. It has been the aim of the 
author to reach the private family rather than the hotel or restaurant. 
Each recipe as given, is intended to be amply sufficient for six (6) persons. 
A larger or smaller number can easily be provided for, simply by increas- 
ing or diminishing, proportionately, the different ingredients. For in- 
stance: In providing for three persons, take one-half the quantity that is 
necessary for six persons ; for nine persons , increase the quantity one- 
half; and for twelve, double the quantity, and so on. 

A " Pinch of Salt " represents 205 grains, or a tablespoonful. 

" Half a Pinch of Pepper " represents 38 grains, or a teaspoonful. 

A " third of a Pinch of Nutmeg " represents 13 grains, or half a tea- 
spoonful. 



TABLE ETIQUETTE. 

When a dinner is given to near relatives, or very old acquaintances, 
table etiquette is not so rigorously observed as when a distinguished or 
specially invited guest, or guests, are entertained. 

At every dinner given to invited guests the host presides. His place 
is at the head of the table. As every long t&ble has two ends, the head 
is usually distinguished as the end nearest the window side, or opposite 
the main entrance to the dining-room. 

The principal guest occupies the seat to the right of the host. 

Should it be a dinner given to gentlemen only, those standing highest 
in " society " should be placed nearest the host or the guest. 

When ladies are participating, they should be so placed as to be seated 
between two gentlemen, and vice versa; but never so that a gentleman is 
seated next his wife. 

If a host invites a married couple, the gentleman sits to the right and 
the lady to the left of the host. 

If the host be married, the hostess occupies the seat next to the invited 
guest. 

On the arrival of the guests, the ladies and gentlemen should be shown 
to different rooms, where they may remove their " wraps." They are then 

437 



.438 SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 

shown to the parlor, where they are received by the host and hostess. 
The interval, until dinner is announced, is sfient in introductions and social 
intercourse. 

When dinner is announced, the host introduces the gentlemen to the 
ladies whom they are to escort and entertain during dinner. 

The host, with the lady of the principal guest, now leads to the dining- 
room, followed by the hostess and guests. 

When dinner is over the host leads again for the parlors. The ladies 
may then be served with tea, and the gentlemen retire for an interval to 
the smoking-room, where cigars should be served. 

Be attentive to ladies who are seated near you. Even when servants 
are present, obligingly pass anything that_may.be desired by others. 

After each course is finished, lay knife and fork on your plate parallel 
to each other. The knife on the right, the fork on the left side. 

Should, unfortunately, any mistakes or accidents occur, let them pass 
without any undue observation. Do not, by any motion or look, increase 
the unpleasantness of the situation. 

While a course is being served, do not show too much haste; however, 
it is entirely unnecessary to wait until all have been served. This does 
not apply to the first course. Should the first course consist of oysters 
or soup, wait until all have been served. Commence then, as soon as the 
host does. 

Table etiquette does not, necessarily, compel you to accept every 
course or dish. But it is a serious breach of etiquette to examine a dish 
and then refuse it. 

Everything that can be cut without the knife should be cut with the 
fork. For instance: fish, sweet-breads, bouchfees, or vegetables. 

Be careful to make no noise with the knives, forks, or dishes. Avoid 
the smacking of lips while eating or drinking. 

J Should anything objectionable be found on your plate, quietly ignore 
pt. Any demonstreltion in this direction might seriously mar the beauty 
of the dinner. ; 

Unfold the napkin on your lap; never put it around the neck, nor tuck 
it under your collar.

EGGS. 

1395. Eggs Molet. — Take six fresh eggs, drop them all at the same 
time with a skimmer or a spoon into boiling water, and let boil for five 
minutes and a half, but no longer; lift them up, and immediately drop 
them into cold water for two minutes, then take them up carefully; peel 
them — seeing that the white is intact — then keep them in a little warm 
consommfe or water. Have a quart of hot purfee of chestnuts (No. 131), 
place it in the pastry-bag (No. 1079), i" which you previously slide down 
a fancy tube (No. 3), then nicely decorate the border of a silver dish, large 
enough to hold the six eggs, also a little at the bottom to lay the eggs 
over. Place the dish in the hot oven for two minutes, then pour in the 
centre of the dish a gill of demi-glace sauce (No. 185); gently lay the eggs 
in the centre of the dish, and serve. 

The above eggs can be served in various ways — with chicory garnish- 
ing, spinach, sorrel, Spanish sauce, plain, etc. 

1396. Eggs h. laW. B. Kendall. — Have six medium-sized, thoroughly 
ripe, red and sound tomatoes, wash and dry them; cut away a piece an inch 
in diameter at the bottom of the tomatoes, including the stems ; remove the

lay the tomatoes in the pan, the cut part upward, mix one tablespoonful of 
salt with a teaspoonful of pepper, and with it equally season the inside of 
ihe tomatoes ; sprinkle their surface with a little clarified butter, then place , 
in a very hot oven for three minutes. Remove them from the oven, place 
the sautoire on a table, then crack one fresh egg into each tomato, place 
them in the oven again for two minutes, remove them. Arrange six fried 
bread crofltons on a hot dish, then with cake-turner take the tomatoes one

peeled shallot, one green pepper, and a half a clove of sound garlic, place 
these in a sautoire with a tablespoonful of clarified butter, range the pan 
on the corner of the hot stove, and slowly simmer for four minutes, then 
add a gill of tomato sauce (No. 205), and one drop of tabasco sauce; cook 
for three minutes. Strain the same through a sieve into a hot bowl,

ped chives, and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one tablespoonful of cold 
milk, and two tablespoonfuls of very fresh bread-crumbs. Mix the whole 
well together with a spoon, then with the preparation fill the hollow space 
of the twelve half eggs just even up to the surface. Close them together 
so as to give them their original shape. Then carefully press a skewer 
through one egg, right in the centre lengthwise, then another, so as to 
have two on each skewer, repeat the same with the other four. Lay them 
in a sautoire with a gill of white broth (No. 99). Cover the sautoire with 
either a copper or tin cover, and place in the oven for five minutes. 
Remove them; have a hot dish ready with three canapes, as for No. 832. 
Arrange the skewers over each canape, and serve with the following sauce.

then place the pan on the corner of the range to keep warm. Take six hard 
boiled shelled eggs. Cut each one into four even slices crosswise, season 
with a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper equally divided. 
Lightly butter a silver dish. Arrange a very thin layer of the above gar- 
nishing over it. Take the sliced eggs and lay one slice on the dish, then a 
very small thin slice of Swiss cheese — then again a slice of egg and a slice 
of cheese — always keeping them one overlapping another, both eggs and 
cheese; continue the same with the rest, giving a crown shape around the 
dish. 

Pour half a gill of hot tomato sauce (No. 205) on top of both eggs and

small strips lengthwise a quarter of an inch thick, gently lay one strip 
over each egg crosswise — right in the centre, so that, when completed, they 
will represent small fancy baskets. Neatly decorate their surface with a 
little cooked jardinifere; arranged in this way they will represent perfect 
baskets of abundance. Arrange a small layer of the preparation for each 
egg on a silver dish just wide enough to hold each one firmly. Place the 
eggs now on top of each layer, pour a gill of Colbert sauce (No. igo) around 
the dish, but none over the eggs. Cover them with a piece of well- 
buttered paper, then place in the oven — rather moderate — for two minutes.

close them, so as to represent six original eggs. Have a silver dish, lightly 
buttered, ready, then arrange the balance of the stuffing right in the centre 
of the dish, giving a pyramid shape; place the eggs at the base of the pyra- 
mid upright, so they will lightly lean against it.

and add it to the chocolate, stirring briskly meanwhile; place the pan on 
the corner of the range, and let gently simmer for fifteen minutes, but 
do not allow it to boil. 

Have an omelette made as in No. 450, and before folding place half of the 
preparation right in the centre, fold up, turn it over a hot silver dish. Place 
the balance of the preparation into the pastry-bag (No. 1079), with a small 
tube previously slided down; and by pressing the preparation, make a nice 
rosette at each end of the omelette. Decorate the dish all around with six 
lady- fingers cut in triangular shaped pieces; carefully press a little of the 
contents of the bag on each piece of lady-fingers, so as to have them repre- 
sent pretty, small roses. Liberally dredge them with powdered sugar, 
then glaze the omelette with a red iron, and then send to the table. 

N. B.— All these sweet omelettes should always be promptly made for 
the time of serving, otherwise it would be sufficient cause to fail to have 
them to perfection.

1421. How to prepare Fillets of Sole.— Procure two fine, fresh, me- 
dium-sized soles. Cut them straight on the back bone — commencing 
from the head right down to the tail. Carefully remove both fillets 
on the back with a sharp knife, turn them over, and do the same; make a 
light incision with a knife at the tail part — sufficiently large to get hold 
of with the thumb and forefinger — having in the right hand a keen knife 
placed flat under the fillet; carefully pull the skin with the left hand, hold- 
ing the knife firmly and flatly, then proceed the same with the rest, and 
the fillets will be ready /or use. ' 

1422. Fillets of Sole k la Miss Mege. — Place the fillets of sole , prepared 
as in No. 1421, on a dish. Season with a tablespoonful of salt and a tea-

the bottom of a well-buttered sautoire a small sprig of thyme, a small 
branch of parsley, adding half a glass of white wine and half a glass of- 
mushroom liquor, tightly cover the pan, and then place it on the hot range 
to cook for five minutes. Have in a sautoire a tablespoonful of butter, 
with one and a-half tablespoonfuls of flour; mixall well together, then place 
the pan on the hot range, and slowly cook, without browning, for five min- 
utes. Remove the fillets from off the range, nicely dress them on a hot 
serving dish, one overlapping another, cover them with another hot dish,

and leave at the oven door to keep warm. Add now the gravy of the fil- 
lets to the butter and flour, briskly stirring meanwhile; add again half a 
cup of mushroom liquor, if at hand — if not, the same quantity of white 
broth (No. 99) will answer — and let just come to a boil; then place on the 
comer of the range for four minutes. Take two cooked lobster claws, if 
at hand, slice each one in half, then, with a tube half an inch in diameter, 
cut it into small pieces, place them in the sautoire in which the fillets were 
cooked, with one sound sliced trufHe and eight whole mushrooms, and a 
teaspoonful of butter; heat it up; then strain through a sieve the other 
sauce into this, gently shu£9e the pan, so as to mix the whole well to- 
gether for two minutes, then pour the sauce over the fillets. Decorate the 
dish all around with six heart-shaped bread croutons (No. 133), and send to

and herbs, mix all well together for one minute. Prepare six fillets of sole 
as for No. 1421; lay them flat on a dish; mix a teatpoonful of salt with 
half a teaspoonful of pepper, equally season the filiets with it. Then 
evenly divide the mushroom garnishing among the six fillets, arranging it 
directly in^the centre of each, crosswise; fold up each fillet carefully 
around the force lengthwise, then arrange them on a lightly buttered silver 
dish upright, one against the other, so as to prevent them from opening; 
sprinkle a little clarified butter over each, then place in the hot oven for 
five minutes. Remove from out the oven, place a whole mushroom on 
top of each fillet, right in the centre. Add now two tablespoonfuls of 
grated Parmesan cheese, to the white sauce which stands on the corner of 
the range, mix well together, then pour all the sauce evenly over the fil-

simmer on the range until almost dry, then add one gill of hot tomato 
sauce (No. 205), and one gill of Espagnole sauce (No. 151), reduce the 
whole to one-half, which will take about eight miniites, then transfer into 
a cold dish, ind let cool off. Remove the fillets from the marinade, pick 
out the six nicest, then with a keen knife make an incision in the side of 
each fillet, right in the centre, three inches in length by one and a half 
inches in width. Equally stuff the fillets with the preparation in the dish, 
give them a nice oval shape, then lay them in a lightly buttered silver 
dish. Cut the other two remaining fillets into three even strips, length- 
wise, neatly pare the edges. Cut a fine, sound truffle with a tube half an 
inch in diameter, then cut it into very thin slices. Make four light inci- 
sions on the surface of each strip, quarter of an inch deep, insert a slice 
of truffle in each incision, and with a knife gently press down the opened 
parts, so as to hold in the truffles; place a strip, over each fillet, right in 
the centre, lengthwise, pour half a wineglass of white wine at the bottom

adding; boil for two minutes, then strain it through a sieve into the sau- 
toire with the other preparation, mix all well together with the spatula 
while cooking for two minutes longer, and leave on the corner of the 
xange. Lightly butter a silver dish, carefully place in the eight fillets, 
one overlapping another, all around the dish, in curb-chain shape; moisten 
their surface with a tablespoonful of white wine, sprinkle just a little clari- 
fied butter over them, and place in the hot oven for three minutes. Re- 
move from out the oven, arrange eight whole fine mushrooms outside and 
all around the fillets, so that the stalk of each mushroom should be in 
■each curb-chain and the button outside. 

Place then the garnishing over the fillets evenly divided; sprinkle again 
a very little clarified butter over all. Place in the hot oven to bake for five

width. Place half of the preparation in a paper cornet, and with it equally 
stuff the six fillets. Lightly butter a pan (a tin one by preference) large 
enough to easily hold the fillets. Have six small, well-cleaned fresh smelts 
four inches in length; then with a keen, small knife carefully cut each 
smelt, beginning right in the centre at the base of the head, following down 
the back bone right through to the tail, cutting it entirely through, so that 
the head will hold both parts ; remove the back bone of each, then arrange 
a smelt on top of each fillet lengthwise, and with the fingers twist each fil- 
tet of the smelt inwardly, up to the base of the head, so that they will 
represent two rings three-quarters of an inch in diameter; proceed the 
same with all. Place the rest of the force in a paper cornet, gently press 
the preparation into each ring of the smelts, up to the surface. Cut with 
a tube, half an inch in diameter, a good sized, sound, truffle; then slice it 
mto twelve even pieces, arrange one slice right in the centre of each ring 
over the force, sprinkle a very little clarified butter over all; pour on the. 
bottom of the pan half a glass of white wine and half a glass of mushroom 
\iquor or white broth. Cover all with a buttered paper, and place in a. 
moderate oven to bake -for eighteen minutes. Remove from out the otren, 
take the paper off, then with a palette knife, or a cake turner, lift up the fil- 
lets one by one, and dress them on a very hot dish. Add either half acup

shallot, a teaspoonful of freshly chopped parsley, half a teaspoonful of 
freshly chopped chervil, and moisten with two wine glasses of white wine. 
Reduce on the hot range to one-quarter. Cut the two reserved fillets into 
very small dice-shaped pieces, and add them to-the rest in the pan; then 
cook the whole for five minutes longer, thicken with a tablespoonful of 
Allemande sauce (No. 210), adding at the same time a tablespoonful of very 
good butter; mix well together, and leave the pan on the corner of the 
range to keep warm. Thoroughly heat, in a pan on the hot range, half a 
gill of clarified butter, then place into it the six fillets as rapidly as possi- 
ble to fry on once side only, for one minute; immediately remove them 
from the pan, and place them on a napkin to dry. Lightly butter a silver 
dish, arrange the fillets over it, the cooked side up, in crown shape. Place 
the above preparation evenly over each fillet, right in the centre, and with 
a table knife give them a pretty dome shape, covering the fillets en- 
tirely. Sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese over each, also a very little 
clarified butter, then place them in the hot oven to bake for eight minutes.

sound trufile into very thin slices, and with a tube, one quarter of an inch 
in diameter, cut out as many round pieces as there are slices of lemon; 
place a piece on each lemon right in the centre on the edge where it was 
cut first. Cut out from the remaining slices of the trufile as many diamond- 
shaped pieces, as there are pieces of lemon; place a piece between each sec- 
tion of the lemon and serve. 

All the dressing for decorating the dish should always be prepared be- 
fore the fillets are dressed on the dish. 

1435. Fillet of Bass k la Chauncey M. Depew. — Procure a fine, fresh 
striped, small bass of about three pounds, scale, remove the entrails, and 
wash thoroughly. Cut'^he head off, and split it into half right down the 
back bone, remove all the bones. Cut out three even fillets from each 
half, suppress the skin, neatly pare them all around, giving them a heart- 
shaped form. Evenly season with a tablespoonful of salt, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, and place on a dish till further action. 

Place in a sautoire one finely chopped sound shallot, with half a medium 
sized sound green pepper, cut into small dice-shaped pieces ; place the pan 
on the hot range, adding a teaspoonful of butter; let slowly simmer for 
three minutes, without letting get brown. Add now the parings of the fil- 
lets, with eight whole mushrooms and one truffle, all chopped very fine; 



{^ 457 

pour in half a glassful of white wine, let reduce to three-quarters. Season 
with half a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper, and then leave 
it on the corner of the range. 

Have a saucepan on the range with a tablespoonful of butter and two 
heaped tablespoonfuls of flour; mix thoroughly together, and let stand on 
the comer of the range for five minutes without browning; gradually add a 
cupful of hot milk, continually stirring while adding it, and let slowly sim- 
mer for twelve minutes. Add two tablespoonfuls of this sauce to the other 
preparation to thicken, thoroughly mixing together for two minutes. Take 
from off the lire, lay on a table. ' 

Lightly butter a baking pan; lay the six fillets over it, seeing that they 
do not touch one another; then equally divide the preparation over each 
fillet — well spread; place on top of this a teaspoonful of the white sauce, 
which is waiting action on the range, gently spreading it with a small knife, 
so as to completely cover the first layer of each fillet. Arrange four very 
thin slices of truffles, cut with a tube half an inch in diameter, right in the 
centre of each fillet, lengthwise, one overlapping the other. Sprinkle a very 
little clarified butter over all, pour half a glassful of white wine at the bot- 
tom of the pan (not over the fillets), then place in a moderate oven for ten 
minutes. Remove from the oven, gently arrange them- on a hot serving 
dish with a palette knife. Add to the remaining sauce on the fire, half a 
gill of sweet cream, let it come to a boil; strain it through a fine sieve into 
a hot bowl, then pour it all around the fillets, but not over them, and send 
to the table. 

1436. Fillet of Blueflsh k la T^nitieime. — Procure a fine, fresh, 
medium-sized bluefish, from two and a half to three pounds, thoroughly 
remove the entrails, cut the head off, split in half right down the back- 
bone, remove the spine, cut each half into three equal pieces, triangular 
shape, neatly pare the edges. Place the fillets in a well-buttered baking-pan. 
Season with a tablespoonful of salt and a teaspoonful of pepper; pour a 
glassful of white wine over all, and let marinate until further action. Place 
in a saucepan the parings of the fish, as well as the back-bone; cut it into 
three pieces, suppressing the head; place the pan on the hot range, pour 
in a glass of white wine, and a quart of cold white broth (No. gg), let it 
come to a boil, and then immediately skim it; add now one sprig of thyme, 
a very small bay-leaf, one branch of parsley, one medium-sized, sound, 
sliced onion, and one small sliced carrot; then let slowly simmer for fifteen 
minutes. 

Place in a small saucepan one tablespoonful of butter, and two of flour, 
thoroughly mix on the range for seven minutes, or until it obtains a good 
golden color. Strain the fish-broth into a bowl, then gradually add it to 
the roux (flour), continually stirring meanwhile; add to this half a gill of 
tomato sauce, let all cook for ten minutes, skim it once in a while. Add 
twelve sound whole mushrooms; leave on the corner of the range till 
further action. Now place the fillets in the hot oven to bake for ten 
minutes. Remove from out the oven, carefully dress them on a hot dish

SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 



in star shape. Remove the mushrooms from the sauce with a skimmer, 
place them right in the centre of the fillets, pour the sauce over all, so as 
ito completely cover the fillets, and serve. 

1437. Canapes ^ la Edw. Van Tolkenberg. — Have four ounces of 
lean cooked ham, thoroughly pound it in the mortar; add to it now one 
ounce of hard fresh butter, mix well together; add four fine, small Antwerp 
anchovies, the juice of a small sound lemon, or the juice of one lime, if at 
hand, and not quite the third of a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper; pound 
the whole well together again. Remove it from the mortar, place on a 
dish in the ice-box until further action. 

Cut out from an American stale bread six round pieces four inches in 
diameter and an inch thick, place them on a tin baking-pan, sprinkle a very 
little clarified butter over each, and place in the hot oven for four minutes, 
or until they have obtained a good golden color. Remove from the oven, 
and cool for one minute. Have in a saucepan on the fire two tablespoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese and a tablespoonful of grated Swiss cheese, 
with a tablespoonful of sweet cream, and continually stir until thoroughly 
dissolved. Remove it then from the fire, and let slightly cool off. 

Take the preparation from the ice-box, and equally divide it over the 
croutons, giving them a dome shape, and then equally divide also the 
cheese over the preparation. Place them in a baking-dish, and bake them 
in a very hot oven for three minutes. Take from out the oven, dress on a 
hot serving-dish with a folded napkin over it. Have six stoned olives, turn 
half a small anchovy around each olive, place one on top of each canap6 
upright, decorate the dish with a few parsley greens, and serve. 

1438. Canapes a la Frank A. Watson. — Place in a mortar four ounces 
of the finest quality of Russian caviare, the juice of a fine sound lime, 
thoroughly mix for three minutes; add to it a finely peeled, sound, chop- 
ped shallot, and not quite the thiird of a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, also 
half an ounce of fresh firm butter, four anchovies (small), and the yoke of 
one hard-boiled egg; sharply pound the whole well together until to a per- 
fect paste, then remove it from the mortar, and leave on a dish in the ice- 
box till called for. 

Cut out from an American stale bread six round croutons four inches 
in diameter by one inch in thickness; lay them on tin baking-jian, sprinkle 
a very little clarified butter over each, and place in the hot oven for four 
minutes. Take them out, and let cool off for one minute. Remove the 
preparation from the ice-box, and evenly divide it over the six' croutons, 
giving a nice dome shape. Chop up very fine the white of the hard-boiled 
egg which is left over, lay it on a saucer, adding to it two tablespoon- 
fuls of grated Parmesan cheese, mix well, and equally divide it over the six 
canapfes. Arrange them on a baking-dish, place in a very hot oven for three 
minutes. Remove from out the oven, dress them on a hot serving-dish 
with a folded na[pkin over it; decorate the dish all around with a few pars- 
ley greens, and six quarters of lemon, arranged at equal distances, and then 
serve. 



FISH. 



459 



1439. Sbiped Bass Boiled k la Lorenzo C. Delmonico.— Procure a 

fine fresh bass of about four to five pounds, neatly scale it, remove the 
entrails, and wash it well. Have a fish-kettle with one carrot and one 
onion, finely sliced, placed at the bottom; add one sprig of thyme and 
one parsley root, one bay-leaf, six cloves, and twelve whole peppers, place 
the fish lifter over the ingredients, and then lay the bass in a straight posi- 
tion on the lifter; completely cover the bass with cold water, add four 
heaped tablespoonfuls of salt and half a glass of vinegar; place it on the 
range, and let slowly come to a boil, which ought to take about thirty 
minutes. 

Have in a saucepan half a finely chopped-up shallot, with a good glass- 
ful of red wine; reduce on the range to just one-half, add to it one gill of 
Espagnole sauce (No. 151), let come to a boil, squeeze in the juice of half a 
sound lemon, and leave on the corner of the range till required. Peel eight 
small, sound potatoes, give them a nice egg-shape, wash them, place in 
cold water with a tablespoonful of salt, and boil for about twenty minutes ^ 
drain them, lay a napkin over to keep warm. 

Have twelve freshly opened medium-sized oysters, place in a sautoire 
with their own liquor, let them^come to a boil on the range, skim well, and 
add a tablespoonful of good butter, with twelve small mushrooms. Cut 
the tail part of a small cooked lobster into half an inch square pieces, add 
it to the oysters, let cook together for two minutes. Lift up the fish with 
the lifter, let drain over the kettle for one minute, then gently slide it on 
a hot dish with a folded napkin over it, place a cluster of four potatoes at 
each end of the fish. Have either six scallop or clam shells well cleaned. 
Place two oysters on each shell, then two mushrooms, and equally divide 
the lobster on the six shells. 

Add to the sauce in the pan in which the oysters were cooked, one 
tablespoonful of demi-glace (No. 185), mix a little, and then evenly pour it 
over the six fillets. Arrange three shells at each side of the fish. Strain 
the other sauce into a sauce-bowl, and send to the table separate. 

1440. Cold Bass h, la James Gordon Bennett. — Procure a fine striped 
bass of about six pounds; scale, remove the entrails, and thoroughly wash 
it. Place at the bottom of a fish kettle one sliced carrot, one sliced onion, 
one parsley root, one bay-leaf, four cloves, and twelve whole peppers. 
Place the lifter over the vegetables, and then gently lay the bass straight 
on top of it. Completely cover the fish with cold water. Season with a 
handful of salt, adding a wineglassful of white wine, then let slowly heat on 
a moderate fire until it comes to a boil. Remove the kettle from the fire, 
and let it thoroughly cool off in its own broth. Remove the fish from the 
kettle, lay it on a cold dish, dampen a napkin in the broth, and completely 
cover the fish with it to prevent the bass getting dry; then place it in the 
ice-box until further action. Strain three quarts of the fish broth into a 
saucepan, add a medium-sized sound, sliced lemon, and let it reduce on 
the hot range to one-half, add one leaf of Peter Cooper's clarified gelatine 
(if not at hand, use one ounce of the other gelatine), let thoroughly dissolve. 



460 SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 

stirring it meanwhile with a wooden spatula. Prepare in a bowl the white 
of two fresh eggs, including the shells; thoroughly mix together; add 
now a cupful of cracked ice. Remove the gelatine from the range, place 
it on a table; gradually add to the eggs a ladleful of the gelatine, contin- 
ually stirring the eggs meanwhile; and then add this to the saucepan, stir- 
Ting while adding it; place it on the corner of the range, let it slowly come 
to a boil, and then boil for two minutes. Remoye it from the fire; strain it 
twice through either a wet flannel bag or a wet clean napkin into a vessel; 
and let cool off. 

Wash well and boil two quarts of fine white hominy for thirty-five 
miniites; season with a tablespoonful of salt, pour it into a flat pan, and 
■let thoroughly cool off. 

Take the fish from the ice-box, remove the napkin, gently lay it over 
the prepared hominy. Cut with a knife a square piece of kbout three 
ounces of jelly; let it lightly dissolve in a pan on the corner of the range, 
stirring continually. Prepare a pint and a half of mayonnaise, as for No. 
ao5; add the dissolved jelly to the mayonnaise, mixing it thoroughly, then 
with a wooden salad-spoon pour the mayonnaise right straight down the 
centre of the fish, beginning at the head right down to the tail, and con- 
tinue so on until the fish is completely masked from head to tail; put it 
in a cool place to let the mayonnaise and jelly get firm. 

Have six small cleaned timbales, one and a half inches in diameter by 
two inches deep;, place at the bottom of each a thin, round slice of truffle, 
cut with a tube half an inch in djameter. Dissolve about two ounces of 
jelly, taking care that it is not very hot, pour a teaspoonful of the jelly at 
the bottom of each timbale. Have a bowl with ice-water in it, dip in each 
timbale without letting any water get into them; turn them gently, so 
as to have them completely coated inside with the jelly. Have six heaped 
tablespoonfuls of cooked macfedoine (No. 1032) on a dish; season with a 
teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a teaspoonful 
of good wine vinegar, mix all well together, then equally divide it into the 
six timbales, but do not pour the vinegar remaining on the plate ; pour in the 
balance of the dissolved jelly evenly over the macedoine in each timbale, 
place them in the ice-box to cool. 

With a keen knife cut the hominy from all around as near the fish as 
possible, so that it will have exactly the same shape; remove the hominy 
that was cut away. Pass the palette of a cake-turner at the head part, 
right under the hominy, gently raise it up, and with the left hand in the 
centre under the hominy lift it, up, and carefully lay it on a cold dish. 
Unmold the six timbales by lightly dipping them in warm water, so as to 
liave them easily detached; place them at equal distances around the dish. 
Cut out six triangular-shaped crofitons of jelly one inch thick, two inches in 
length by one and a half inches in width, place one between each timbale, 
•and it will be ready to send to the table. ' 

It would be advisable to prepare the above fish one day before the time 
of serving, ^nd dress on the dish one hour before sending it to the table. 



FISH. 46 T 

If any of the fish remains it can be utilized for patties, cutlets, or cro- 
quettes. 

1+41. Sialt Mackerel k laWhitmore. — Have two fine, medium-sized 
sound salt mackerel. Let them soak in plenty of cold water for at least 
eighteen hours, changing the water two or three times. Take out and 
thoroughly dry ; remove the back bone of each. Arrange them on a 
well-oiled fish -broiler, split part upward, and then with a hair brush 
gently oil the surface. Place them on a very brisk fire for five minutes, 
on the split side, and two minutes on the skin side. Remove them from 
the broiler, dress on a hot dish, pour half a gill of drawn butter over, 
decorate the dish with one lemon cut in quarters and some parsley greens, 
and send to the table. 

1442. Salt Mackerel BoUed k la Cowing. — Prepare two fine salt 
mackerel exactly the same as for the above (No. 1441). But instead of 
broiling them, place them in a saucepan.with plenty of cold water, on the 
hot range, and as soon as they come to a boil place the pan aside and let 
slowly cook for seven minutes longer. Remove them carefully with a skim- 
mer, drain well, dress on a hot serving-dish, place a cluster of Hollandaise 
potatoes (No. 999) at each end of the dish, decorate the sides with six 
quarters of lemon, three at each side, and serve with half a gill of drawn 
butter in a sauce-bowl separately. 

1443. Fried White Bait. — Have one pound of fine fresh white-bait, 
thoroughly wash them in cold water; the water in which they are washed 
must be very cold, a piece of ice can even be added to it, so as to keep 
them firm; thoroughly drain, then inclose them in a dry towel and lightly 
shake them so as to thoroughly dry. Dip them in cold milk. Mix together 
two cups of cracker dust with one cupful of flour, roll the white-bait into 
this, and then fry them in very hot fat for one minute only. Remove, 
and thoroughly drain, sprinkle over a tablespoonful of salt equally divided. 
Dress on a hot dish with a folded napkin, and immediately send to the table. 

White-bait should never be prepared in advance, except one minute 
before the time of serving, as they are very easily spoiled. 

1444. Wllite-Bait k la W. Merrill. — Prepare a pound of fine white- 
bait the same as the above (No. 1443); when fried, mix a tablespoonful of 
salt with a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper and equally sprinkle it over

and serve. 

1445. Oysters k laW. F. G. Shanks.— Have three dozen fine, large, 
fresh box oysters opened into a bowl; thoroughly drain their liquor off, 
and then place them in a sautoire on the fire with half an ounce of good 
butter. Season with a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and then cook 
them as rapidly as you possibly can for ten minutes. Pour in two taole- 
spoonfuls of good Madeira wine or sherry. Beat up in a bowl the volks 
of three fresh raw eggs with half a pint of sweet cream, then add it to the 
oysters, and continually shuffle the sautoire until reaching boiling-point, 
then transfer them in a chafine-dish or hot soup tureen, sprinkle a treble-

spoonful of good Madeira wine or sherry over all, tightly cover, and 
send to the table. 

1146. Oysters Scalloped k la Baltimore.— Have three dozen good- 
sized, fine freshly opened box oysters, put them in a bowl. Season with 
a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, and entirely suppress their liquor, 
seeing that they are almost dry. Have six small silver scallop-shells, 
lightly butter the interior of each, then evenly spread a tablespoonful of 
fresh bread-crumbs in each shell, gently lay six oysters in each shell over 
the crumbs, and then sprinkle a tablespoonful of bread-crumbs on the oys- 
ters in each shell; place half a teaspbonful of good butter in the centre of 
each shell ; place them in a yery hot oven to bake for fully fifteen min- 
utes, or until they have obtained a good golden color. Remove them from 
the oven. Dress the six shells on a hot serving-dish, with a folded 
napkin, and send to the table. 

1447. Soft Clams en Brochette ^ la A. F. Montant.— Have twenty- 
four fine freshly opened soft clams, neatly clean them, then place them in a 
saucepan with their own liquor. Season with a teaspoonful of pepper 
only; place the pan on the fire and let them just come to a boil. Remove

Take six silver skewers ; run a skewer through a clam right in the cen- 
tre, then run the skewer through a small square piece of raw bacon, then 
another clajm, a piece of bacon, and so on until you have four clams and 
four pieces of bacon alternately on each skewer. Then gently sprinkle 
them with fresh bread-crumbs, place them on the broiler, and broil for one 
and a half minutes on each side, remove from off the fire, dress the six 
skewers on a hot serving-dish, pour half a gill of maltre d'hStel (No. 145) 
over them; decorate the dish yirith six pieces of lemon cut in quarters 
and a few parsley-greens, and serve hot. 

1448. Terrapin k la Robert Bonner. — Have two fine diamond-back 
terrapin prepared the same as in No. 60. Suppress the claws as well as the 
galls, then cut them into very small even pieces. 

Have a well-cleaned chafing-dish, light the jets of the alcohol lamp, 
pour into the water pan suflScient boiling water to fill it up to half its 
height. Arrange the dish over the water pan, place in the dish half ah 
ounce of very good fresh butter, and then put in the terrapin also. Sea- 
son with a tablespoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
moisten with a gill of very good Madeira wine (the older the better), 
tightly place the cover of the chafing-dish on, and then reduce the wine 
to one-half, which will take fifteen minutes, without disturbing it. 

Beat up, in a bowl, the yolks of four fresh eggs with half a pint of sweet 
cream. Remove the cover from the chafing-dish, then pour in the beaten- 
up eggs and cream, gently shuffle the dish, so as to mix all well together, 
arrange the cover on again, and let gently simmer for twenty-five minutes 
longer, gently shuffling the dish containing the terrapin every five minutes.

not too ripe yellow bananas, cut each one in halves, crosswise, place them 
on a dish. Have a well-prepared batter as for No. iigo; gently and care- 
fully roll them in the batter one by one, so as to keep them in their orig- 
inal form. Place them in very hot fat, and fry for ten minutes. Lift 
them up with a skimmer, thoroughly drain. Dress them on a hot dish 
with a folded napkin, and serve. 



464 SUPPLEMENT TO TJIE TABLE. 

1454. Banana, Med k la John Claflin. — Select six very firm, sound, 
red bananas; carefully peel them, cut each one into halves lengthwise, 
place them on a dish, one beside another, sprinkle two tablespoonfuls of 
flour over, gently and carefully roll them in the flour without disturbing 
their shapes. 

Have two gills of sweet olive-oil in a sautoire on the hot range, and 
when very hbt, with the medium of a flat spoon transfer the half bananas 
gently into the very hot oil, and fry them for five minutes on one side, 
then turn them over and fry for five mirtutes on the other side. Gently 
lift them up with a skimmer one by one, carefully dress them on a hot 
dish with a folded napkin, and send to the table. 

1455. Fried Bananas a la Juarez. — Have six firm, sound, not too ripe 
bananas: neatly peel them, and proceed to fry them in exactly the same 
manner as above (No. 1454), but using the same quantity of clarified butter 
instead of sweet-oil. 

1456. How to Blanch Macaroni and Spaghetti. — Have a pan on the 
fire with plenty of water, with two tablespoonfuls of salt; and thoroughly 
boiling, gently slide in three-quarters of a pound of fine Italian macaroni 
without breaking it. Should any stick out of the pan, gently press 
it down when the water boils again so as to have it as long as pos- 
sible. Boil it for seventeen minutes. Remove from the fire, drain 
well, lightly refresh it in cold water, drain again, and then it will be 
ready for use whenever desired. Spaghetti is blanched the same way. 

1457. Macaroni k la Creme. — Take the above quantity of blanched 
macaroni, place it in a sautoire on the fire, with three ounces of butter, 
tossing well until it has thoroughly absorbed the butter; then add 
five heaped tablespoonfuls of grated Swiss cheese, season with a table- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of white pepper, and the tljird of a salt- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg, and pour in a gill of hot Bechamel sauce (No. 
154). Toss all well together, while thoroughly heating for five minutes. 
No spoon or fork should be used for mixing, as it only needs tossing. 
Place it in a hot hollow dish or tureen, and send it to the table. 

1458. Timbale de Macaroni h la Napolitaine. — Instead of, preparing 
three-quarters of a pound of macaroni as in No. 954, prepare only half a 
pound. Have a nice round timbale about six to seven inches in diameter, 
lightly butter the interior. Cut one good-sized sound truffle with a tube 
one inch in diameter, cut also a small piece of cooked smoked beef tongue, 
of the red part, with the same tube, then cut both into very thin even 
slices. Place one slice of truffle at the bottom of the timbale right in 
the centre, then place four pieqes of tongue at equal distances around the 
slice of truffle. Arrange macaroni all around each piece of tongue, be- 
ginning at the side of the truffle and ending at the other side. Have four 
pieces of truffle cut in diamond-shape; place one piece at each section of 
the macaroni, then arrange a large macaroni completely around the de- 
sign, as close as possible, and continue the same until the mold is com- 
pletely covered all around, and then lay in the ice-box until further action. 



VEGETABLES. 465 

Vlace the remaining macaroni in a saucepan with two ounces of good but- 
ter, tossing well while heating for five minutes, season with a tablespoon- 
lul of salt and a third of a saltspoonful of cayenne pepper, adding five 
leaped tablespoonfuls of grated Swiss cheese and a gill of tomato sauce; (No. 
205) toss well agajn, to mix well together. Cut the remainder of the tongue 
and truffles into thin slices, and add them to the macaroni; gently toss 
again for two minutes; take from off the fire, and let cool off for fifteen 
minutes. Take the decorated mold from the ice-box, and then carefully 
fill it with the above preparation, being very careful not to disturb the de- 
sign. Place the timbale into a large saucepan, fill the pan with water, up 
to half the height of the timbale, then place it in a moderate oven to cook 
for one hour and a half. Remove from out the oven, take the timbale out 
of the water. Have a hot serving-dish, then carefully turn the timbale 
over the dish, lift up the mold, pour half a gill of hot tomato sauce around 
the dish, and send to the table. 

1159. Timbale of Spaghetti & la Lerentinese. — Prepare half a pound 
of spaghetti exactly the same as for No. 1456. Have a piece of cooked 
smoked beef tongue, red part; cut off a very thin slice, two and a half inches 
in length by two in width, and with a pointed sharp knife cut out of it a 
shield, then cut a cross out right in the centre of the shield, one inch in 
length by one in width. Have the white of a cooked egg, cut out of it a 
thin slice, then cut into a cross, to fit the one cut out of the centre of the 
shield. Take a round timbale mold, from six to seven inches in diameter, 
place the shield at the bottom of the mold right in the centre, carefully 
lay the egg cross right in the centre of the shield, gently pressing it down. 
Have one cooked string bean about two inches long, cut it in half,' then 
place one piece at each side of the shield, beginning at the end, going up to 
half the height of the shield. Split twelve cooked peas into halves, ar- 
range six pieces alongside of each string bean, so as to represent olive 
branches, then arrange the spaghetti all around the mold, the same as for

BREAD. 

1463. How to prepare the Dough for French Bread.— Sift on a table 
four pounds of the best flour procurable, transfer two pounds of it into a 
bowl of the capacity to hold ten quarts. Make a hollow space in the cen- 
tre of the flour in the bowl, then put in it one ounce of compressed 
yeast, pour in one pint of lukewarm water, then with the hand thoroughly 
dissolve the yeast in the water for three minutes thereafter; gradually 
incorporate the flour for five minutes, then sharply knead the whole foj 
five minutes. Fully cover the bowl with a napkin, lay the bowl in a 
warm place of about eighty degrees temperature, to let the sponge rise 
for two hours. During that length of time the sponge will double, 
after about one hour and a half (after being put away) then fall, and again 
rise double. Have in a vessel one pint of lukewarm water, or the 
same quantity of lukewarm' milk, add one and a half ounces of salt, thor- 
oughly dissolve for one minute, then pour it into the bowl with the 
sponge, and thoroughly knead the whole well together for five minutes. 
Now gradually add the two remaining pounds of flour, constantly knead- 
ing meanwhile, which ought to take about fifteen minutes, to have it 
smooth and consistent. Lift up the dough with the hands and sharply 
knock it against the bottom of the bowl for at least six or seven different 
times, so as to have it of a firm consistency; then cover the bowl with a 
napkin, place it in a warm place, the same temperature as before, to rise 
for two hours again; by this time the dough should be raised double. 
Remove the napkin and transfer the dough on a lightly floured table. Cut 
out a two-pound piece, and with the hands roll and press it into a ball 
shape for three minutes, then lay it aside. Cut out another of the same 
weight, roll and press it in the same way as the first. Cut the remaining 



BREAD. 467 

dough into twelve equal pieces, and roll them also into ball shapes, and 
let rest for three minutes. 

1464. How to shape French Bolls and Flnttes.— Have a square tin 
pan eighteen inches long; lay over it a duck cloth twice longer than the 
pan; flute the cloth up two inches high, and two inches apart from one an- 
other. Take a rolling-pin six inches long by half an inch thick, lay it cross- 
wise over a small ball shape right in the centre, and with both hands press 
it down almost to the bottom, then slightly roll the pin, taking care to 
leave the third of an inch intact; remove the pin, then place the shape-like 
Toll into a section of the fluted cloth in the pan, and then proceed with five 
more exactly the same. Now take one of the remaining small balls, and 
-with the hands roll it out to the length of four inches, and then place it in 
the fluted cloth and proceed the same with the other five. 

1465. How to shape the French Loaf and Bing (or Conronne). — 
Take one of the large ball-shaped pieces of dough, and with the hands roll it 
out evenly to eighteen inches long. Flute a section of the cloth in the pan 
three inches high by four inches wide, then gently lay the dough in it; 
■cover all with a sheet of paper, and then place the pan in a warm place to 
rise. Evenly roll out the last ball-shaped dough with the hands, twenty- 
four inches long, then firmly join (or connect) both ends together, giving 
it a pretty round ring shape; place it then into a baking pan, lay a sheet 
of paper over, and put it in a warm place to rise. 

1466. How to bake the Rolls and Flnttes.— Allow the rolls and 
fluttes to rise for three-quarters of an hour. Then transfer them into a 
baking-sheet, keeping them one inch apart one from another. Make three 
^mall diagonal incisions on top of the six fluttes ; then place them in a hot 
oven to bake for thirty minutes. Remove from out the oven, lay aside, 
and serve when desired. 

1467. How to bake the French Loaf and Ring (Conronne).— Take 
a board eighteen inches long by five inches wide and half an inch thick. 
Lightly flour it, and place it right alongside of the French-loaf-shaped 
one, and with the hands lift up the cloth on the opposite side, turning the 
loaf on the board, and then carefully turn the loaf from the board into a 
baking-sheet. Make three light incisions diagonally on top, and place it 
in the hot oven. Immediately make four light incisions, at equal dis- 
tances on top of the ring-shaped one in the pan, and place it also in the 
-upper section of the oven, and let both bake for one hour. Remove them 
from out the oven, and they will be ready to serve. 

1468. Tea Biscnits.- Place in a vessel one and a half pounds of 
flour, half an ounce of fine salt, half an ounce of powdered sugar, and one 
ounce of baking powder. Mix all well with the hand for one minute, 
then transfer the whole into a sieve, over another vessel; press the in- 
gredients through, remove the sieve; add one ounce of good butter, then 
with the hand mix all well for one minute; pour into it one pint of fresh 
milk, then knead the whole well together for five minutes. Transfer the 
dough on a lightly floured table, and with a rolling-pin roll out the dough 



468 SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 

to three-quarters of an inch thick. Cut out from it, with a round paste- 
cutter, two inches in diameter, thirty equal pieces, and lay them close to- 
gether on a buttered baking-pan. Moisten their surface with fresh milk,

gether; then add two ounces of butter and one teaspoonful of saleiratus; 
mix thoroughly for two minutes; add now half a pint of molasses and one 
pint of sour milk; mix the whole well together for five minutes. Have a. 
brown-bread mold sufficiently large to hold three quarts, butter the in- 
terior well, transfer the preparation into it. Then place the mold in a. 
deep pan five inches high ; iill the pan with warm water, place it in a mod- 
erate oven to steam for three hours and a half without disturbing it. 
Take from out the oven, lift up the mold from the pan, turn it onto adish^ 
remove the mold, and it will be ready to serve.

the fillet, so as to make a solid pedestal for the fillet. Cut into oblong 
pieces two good-sized red carrots, two fine white, cooked turnips, seeing 
that they are all cut the same length; arrange a line of cooked green peas, 
by preference, all around the edges of the bottom of the mold, then 
arrange a piece of carrot over the peas, slightly inclined toward the right, 
then a piece of turnip inclined in the same way, and continue so all around 
the mold ; place another line of peas parallel to the other, right over the 
carrots and turnips ; arrange another line of carrots and turnips the same 
ss, the other, but this one inclined toward the left. Boil in a quart of white 
broth (No. 99) for twenty minutes half a pound of well-picked Italian rice; 
then carefully pour the rice right in the centre of the mold, avoiding dis- 
turbing the vegetables; place the mold in a baking-pan, with hot water in 
it up to half its height, place in a moderate oven for twenty minutes, re- 
move from out the oven, and keep in a warm place until further action. 

Place on a wooden board half a pound of flour, make a small hollow 
space in the centre, place in it four ounces of butter, gradually add one gill

sprinkle a very little flour over it, and let rest for a few minutes. Have 
four round molds, three inches in diameter by two and a half in depth, 
very lightly butter the inside of each. Roll out three-quarters of the dough 
to a quarter of an inch thick, then with it line the inside of the four 
molds, fill them with cracker dust, place them on a tin pan, and bake in the 
oven for ten minutes ; remove from out the oven, let cool, throw out the 
•cracker dust, then turn each mold upside down on a table, lift up the molds 
and let cool for awhile. Roll out the rest of the dough as thin as possible, 
then cut out leaves with a wheeled paste-cutter one inch and a half long ; 
take the yolk of one egg and a tablespoonful of water, beat up in a bowl, 
then with a hair brush 'completely glaze the exterior all around of the four 
croustades; completely cover the croustades with the cut out leaves all 
around, commencing at the top, with the points upward, one overlapping 
another. Lightly glaze the leaves now with the beaten egg and water, and 
then place in the hot oven for three minutes, to let them get a good golden 
color ; take from out the oven, lay aside until further action. 

Now place the fillet in the oven to roast for thirty-five minutes, basting 
it occasionally with its own gravy. Remove it from the oven, have a large 
hot dish ready, carefully unmold the rice right in the centre of the dish, 
then gently arrange the fillet on top of the rice right in the centre ; fill two 
croustadeS'with hot mushroom garnishing (No. 230), and fill the other two 
with hot jardinifere (No. 1033); place one mushroom croustade on each side 
of the fillet, and a jardinifere at each end. Pour into the pan in which the fil- 
let was cooked half a glassful of Madeira wine, place on the hot range and let

onions a layer of fat bacon cut in slices a quarter of an inch thick. 
Slice three medium-sized, fine, sound carrots, and place them over the 
bacon, as a third layer. Over all this place a tablespoonful of salt, one 
sprig of thyme, six whole peppers, four cloves, one branch of parsley, and 
one sprig of sweet marjoram. Upon this lay two calves' feet, finely chop- 
ped up, and one pound of lean beef, finely minced. Cover the pan and 
place it on the comer of the range, and let gently simmer undisturbed 
for fully an hour. 

Then uncover the pan and pour in boiling water sufficient to cover 
the contents and no more; then put on the cover, and place the pan by the 
side of the fire to simmer for one hour longer. Then uncover, and strain 
the liquor through a clean napkin, without disturbing the other contents 
in the pan; carefully skim off the little fat that floats over with a clean 
jjiece of blotting paper or a skimmer, and just before serving add a wine- 
glassful of good Madeira wine. 

N. B. — After the broth has been poured off, the contents of the pan 
must not by any means be thrown away, for you will fill up the pan again 
with boiling water and add a few more sweet herbs, and letting it simmer 
gently for two hours, will produce a second edition of the Restorative, 
nearly, if not quite, as good as the first. 

Would urgently recommend the above soup specially to persons suffer-

Then detach them with the fingers, from the paper, place them in a tin 
box or glass jar, and serve when desired. 

If the paste is equally divided it should give about eighty macaroons. 
Should the pan not be sufficiently large to bake them all at a time, they 
can be baked at two or three different times. 

Beat up to a stiff froth, in a copper basin, the whites of four fresh eggs;: 
remove the \»hip, and then with a skimmer gradually and gently mix in 
eight ounces of powdered sugar for three minutes. 

Slide down a tube (No. 3) into the pastry bag (No. 1079); put the prep- 
aration into the bag, and lay it aside for a second. Have a very cold 
dessert-dish ready, and then after two hours have expired take up the 
mold from the pail, dip it into lukewarm water for half a second; neatly 
wipe it all around, remove the cover, and turn the ice-cream on the cold 
dish. Rapidly decorate the top and all around with the preparation in 
the bag, and lightly dredge powdered sugar over it. (The operation, 
after the ice-cream has been unmolded, should be done as rapidly as pos- 
sible.) Lay the dish on a board, then place it in a very hot oven to let 
the mferinge get a light brown color, which ought not to take more than, 
five seconds. . Remove from out thd oven, suppress the board, and im- 
mediately send to the table.

half a pint of sweet cream; briskly stir with the spatula. Have at hand 
in a vessel two quarts of cold water with a piece of ice, in it. Dip the 
forefinger into the ice-water, and then by a. quick movement dip it into 
the caramel the eighth of half an inch, taking up just a little of it, and im- 
mediately redip it in the cold water; feel and see if the caramel around 
the finger is firm and will easily crack, which will be sufficient indication 
that it is cooked; should the case not be such, then cook a little longer 
(always stirring without ceasing); try again, and' so on, until it reaches 
that very point. Then remove it from the fire. Lightly oil a foot 
square of a marble table (but not a wooden one); place four square iron 
bars around the oiled table, a foot long by half an inch thick, and then 
pour the caramel onto the oiled table and let cool for three hours. Re- 
move the bars, turn the caramel upside down on a clean part of the 
table, and with a clean, dry towel thoroughly wipe off the oil from the 
caramel. Then with a knife cut it into strips half an inch wide, and

continually mixing for two minutes more, and then let cool oft for thirty 
minutes. Strain it through a. sieve into an ice - cream freezer (well 
cleaned), place the cover on, lay the freezer in a small tub, fill the tub all 
around the freezer with broken ice slightly mixed with rock-salt; then 
sharply turn the freezer bv the handle of the cover in opposite directions 
for three minutes; remove the cover, and with a wooden spoon detach 
the cream from all around the freezer, as well as from the bottom, re-cov- 
er, and sharply turn it by the handle for three minutes more; uncover, 
detach the cream the same as before, being careful that no ice or salt 
should drop into the freezer; replace the lid and then repeat the, same 
operation three times more. Then fill a well-cleaned quart timbale-mold 
with the ice-cream, sharply pressing it "In with a spoon, strictly seeing 
that the mold is throughly filled, so that no salted water can penetrate 
it- Tightly cover it; have some broken ice mixed with rock-salt at 
the bottom of a pail, lay the mold over, fill the pail with broken ice mixed 
with rock-salt, and let freeze for fully two hours.

tightly cover. Have broken ice mixed with rock-salt at the bottom of a 
pail; lay the mold over; fill the pail with broken ice and rock-salt, and 
let freeze for two hours. 

Beat up to a stiff froth in a copper basin the whites of four eggs; re- 
move the whip, then with a. skimmer mix in eight ounces of powdered 
sugar for two minutes. Slide down a fancy tube (No. 3) in the pastry-bag 
(No. 1079); put the preparation into it; lay it aside for a second. Have a 
very cold dish ready; take up the mold from the pail, quickly dip for 
half a second in lukewarm water, quicky wipe it all around, uncover, 
and turn on the dish; then immediately 4ecorate the top and all around 
with the preparation in the bag, slightly dredge powdered sugar over, lay 
the dish on a board, place in a very brisk oven for five seconds^ to let get 
a light brown color; remove from the oven, take the dish from off the

1523. Timbale ik la Mme. Schultze. — Pour into a saucepan one pint of 
fresh milk, one pint of cold water, and, adding half a saltspoonful of salt, 
place the pan on the fire, and when boiling add four ounces of cleaned, 
raw Italian rice; slowly stir at the bottom with the spatula while cooking 
it for twenty-five minutes. Remove the pan from the range, lay it on a 
table, then immediately add four ounces of powdered sugar, and one 
ounce of fresh butter; mix well together for two minutes, then transfer 
it into a vessel, and let rest for one hour. Pour into a copper basin a pint 
of sweet cream; fill up to half the height of a dish-pan with finely cracked 
ice and water; then lay the basin on it, and with the wire whip beat up 
the cream to a froth, beginning slowly, and gradually increasing in brisk- 
ness, for fifteen minutes; cover the basin with a napkin, and let rest for 
thirty minutes. Transfer the cream with a skimmer into a vessel, and 
briskly beat with the wire whip for two minutes; add to it two ounces of 
powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla essence; mix again for one 
minute. Add now the beaten cream to the prepared rice, and with the 
spatulk mix for five minutes, then lay it aside for further action. Have a 
well-cleaned three-pint timbale-mold ; line the bottom and all around, up to 
half its height, with four ounces of quince jelly. Place right in the centre 
at the bottom of the timbale, a candied cherry. Cut out from a piece of 
angelica two lozenge-shaped pieces, place both with the points against 
the cherry, one opposite the other. Place also two lozenge-shaped 
pieces of candied pineap^ple — points against the cherry — between the two 
angelicas. Cut a red candied pear into quarters, place two quarters in 
the empty spaces between the angelica and pineapple. Arrange the two 
other quarters in the same way on the opposite side. Cut a candied 
apricot into quarters, and place them in the unfilled spaces, the same as 
the others, then place a candied cherry right at the outer point of each 
lozenge. Now gently and. carefully put a quarter of the prepared rice 
into the timbale, over the fruits, evenly spread; then, arrange a layer of

■well-picked, ripe, and fresh strawberries over the rice (if no fresh straw- 
berries beat hand, preserved ones will answer), then evenly spread over 
two ounces of raspberry jam. Now lay over six ounces of sliced candied 
pineapple, and then entirely fill the mold with the balance of the rice. 
Cover the timbale, then place it in a pail, with broken ice at the bottom 
and all around, so as to have it entirely sunken in the ice, and let freeze for 
two hours. Remove the timbale from the pail, dip it in lukewarm 
water for a second, lift it up, neatly wipe it all around with a towel. 
Arrange a folded napkin over a cold silver dish; uncover the mold, and 
turn it on the dish, then send it to the table. 

1524. inmbale h la M. Ficabia. — Pour into a. saucepan one pint of 
fresh milk, one pint of water, season with half a saltspoonful of salt; place 
the pan on the hot range, and, when boiling, plunge in four ounces of well- 
cleaned, Italian raw rice, and continually stir at the bottom with the spat- 
ula, while cooking for twenty-five minutes. Remove it from the fire, lay 
the pan on a table, and immediately add four ounces of powdered sugar, 
one ounce of fresh butter, and one teaspoonful of orange-flower water. 
Mix thoroughly together with the spatula for two minutes ; transfer it then 
into a vessel and let rest for one hour. Lightly butter and gently dredge 
with powdered sugar a. well-cleaned, three -pint timbale-mold. Place 
in a vessel half a pint of well-cleaned, ripe, sound, fresh strawberries, 
with six lady-fingers cut into quarter-inch pieces, and three ounces of 
currant jelly. Mix all well together for two minutes with a spoon, and 
then place it at the bottom of ine mold. Lay over it four lady-fingers cut 
in such away as to entirely cover the first layer, then arrange over it 
eight ounces of candied pineapple cut into thin slices, then entirely fill the 
mold with the prepared rice. Place the mold in a tin pan, fill the pan up to^half 
its height with warm water, put it in a moderate oven to steam for one 
and a half hours. Remove from out the oven, lay it on a table and let rest 
for fifteen minutes. Take the mold up from the pan, carefully slide down 
a thin knife all around the mold, so as to easily detach the timbale; lay a 
dessert-dish over the mold, turn it upside down, and remove the mold. 

Beat up to a stiff froth the whites of three fresh eggs in a copper basin; 
remove the whip, and then with a skimmer gently mix in six ounces of 
powdered sugar. Slide down a fancy tube (No. 2) into the pastry-bag 
(No. 1079); transfer the preparation into the bag, and, by gently pressing 
down the contents on top of the timbale, give' any fanciful dome-like-shape 
desired, and then with the remaining preparation decorate the base of the 
timbale— all around; evenly dredge over it, as well as all around, one 
ounce of powdered sugar. Place it in a moderate oven for ten minutes, 
seeing that it gets a light brown color; take from out the oven and im- 
mediately send to the table. 

1525. Mince Pie h. la Emma Bobbins, New England Fashion.— Pour

SUPPLEMENT TO THE TABLE. 



and then allow it to boil for two hours. Remove the pan from the fire, 
lay it on a table, then with a fork take up the beef, lay it on a dish and 
let thoroughly cool off. Strain the broth through a sieve into another 
saucepan. Have three pounds of fresh beef suet, carefully suppress all 
the sinews, and' then add it to the broth; place the saucepan on the fire, 
and let boil until the suet is thoroughly dissolved, which will take about 
five minutes; then add two pounds of well-stoned and finely chopped Mal- 
aga raisins, and let the whole boil for five minutes, and then add twenty 
fine, sound, medium-sized, peeled, cored, and finely chopped-up apples, 
and let cook again for five minutes. Remove the pan from the fire; trans- 
fer the contents into a vessel, and let thoroughly cool off. 

Chop the beef up very fine, then place it in a vessel, adding to it three- 
quarters of a pound of finely chopped-up candied citron, pouring overlt half 
a pint of good brandy, and let soak for six hours at least. Boil in a sauce- 
pan for one minute two quarts of good cider, then lay it aside to cool off. 

Now transfer the contents of the two vessels to a large saucepan, 
adding one pound of powdered sugar, one pound of well-cleaned currants, 
half a pint of molasses, and the cooled-off cider, and then with the spatula 
mix the whole well together for three minutes. Season with three ounces 
of salt and a quarter of an ounce of black pepper. Place the saucepan on 
the fire, stir at the bottom with the wooden spatula until it is thoroughly 
heated, but under no circumstances allow it to boil. Remove it from the 
fire, transfer the whole into a vessel, and let thoroughly cool off. Then 
grate in the rind of four fine, medium-sized, sound lemons, squeezing 
in the juice also, and adding half an ounce of ground cloves, half an ounce 
of ground cinnamon, half an ounce of ground allspice, half an ounce of 
grated nutmeg, and half a pint of good brandy. Mix the whole well to- 
gether for five minutes. Then transfer the whole into a large stone jar, 
tightly^cover it, andjlay it in a cool place. The above preparation will keep 
in perfect condition for any length of time, even so long as six months. 

Hoia to make the pie. — Take a half-pound of pie paste as in No. 1077, cut 
out a piece of three ounces, roll it round ten inches in diameter. Lightly 
butter a pie-plate nine and a half inches in diameter, arrange the paste 
over it. Then take up from the jar one and a half pounds of the prepared 
mince, \?t.y it over the lined pie-plate — evenly flatten it, leaving one inch 
clear around the edge of the plate; take the remaining five ounces of paste, 
roll it round-shape, the same as before, fold it in two, and with a knife 
make three light inrasions, in the centre, of half an inch each. Lightly 
moisten the edge of the plate with beaten egg, then cover with the paste, 
pressing it down with the hands all around the edge, so as to entirely 
enclose the preparation, and then lightly moisten the surface with beaten 
egg. Place in a moderate oven to bake for fifty minutes. Remove it to 
the oven door, liberally sprinkle powdered sugar over, return it to the 
oven, close the door for two minutes, so as to have the sugar entirely 
melted. Remove from out the oven, then carefully lay the pie on a dessert- 
dish and serve either hot or cold. ?

above batter, and plunge them into plenty of hot fat, but not too hot, and 
fry them for twelve minutes. Remove them with a skimmer from the fat, 
lay them on a tin dish, sprinkle a little powdered sugar over them, 
and then place in a hot oven to glaze for one minute. Remove from the oven,
