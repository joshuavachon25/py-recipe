PREFACE. 

A BOOK in the writer's possession, entitled 
" Camp Cookery," contains the following recipe : 

" Boiled Green Corn. — Boil twenty-five minutes, 
if very young and tender. As it grows older it 
requires a longer time^ Send to the table in a nap- 
kin." 

The writer of the above is a good housewife. She 
cannot conceive that anybody will attempt to boil 
green corn who does not know such rudiments of the 
culinary art as the proper quantity of water to put 
into the pot and the necessity of its being slightly 
salted and at a boil when the corn is put in, instead of 
fresh and cold ; and, like the careful cook that she is, 
she tells the camper to send the ears to the camp 
" table " in a " napkin." 

The faults of the above recipe are the faults of all 
recipes furnished by the majority of books on out- 
door life. They do not instruct in those rudimentary 
principles of cooking so important to the outer who 
has eaten all his life no food except that furnished 
him ready for instant despatch ; and they commend 
to the camper dishes that require materials and 
utensils for their preparation which are seldom at 
hand in the field and forest. 

The object of this little volume is to give to the 



viii Preface. 

Corinthian cruiser and the camper some practical 
recipes for simple but substantial dishes, in such a 
manner that the veriest novice in the art of the 
kitchen may prepare palatable food with no more 
materials and paraphernalia than are consistent with 
light cruising and comfortable camping. The first 
part, "Canoe Cookery," instructs in such dishes as 
the limited outfit of the canoeist or camper who 
"packs" his dunnage afoot will admit of, while 
the second part, " Camp Cookery," deals with the 
more elaborate menu that can be prepared when ease 
of transportation will allow the carriage of a more 
extensive supply. 

Few of the recipes given are original with the com- 
piler. Some have been obtained from trappers and 
hunters, others from army and navy cooks, and a few 
from cook books ; but all have been practically 
tested in camp or on a cruise by the writer, whose 
pleasure in out-door cooking is only equalled by his 
delight in out-door life. 



CANOE AND CAMP COOKERY. 



PART I.— CANOE COOKERY. 

CHAPTER I. 

Outfit for Cooking on a Cruise.— Value of a Single Recep- 
tacle FOR Everything Necessary to Prepare a Meal. — 
The Canoeist's "Grub Box."--TheSame as aSeat. — 
Water-tight Tins. — Necessary Provisions and Uten- 
sils. — Waterproof Bags for Surplus Provisions. — 
Portable Oven.— Canoe Stoves. — Folding Stoves a 
Nuisance. — Hints for Provisioning for a Cruise. 

FOR canoe cruising a certain amount of food sup- 
plies and the necessary utensils for cooking should 
be carried in a single box or chest, so that when one 
cooks a meal on board he may have in one receptacle 
everything necessary for preparing a meal, and when 
going ashore for his repast he can take in his hands 
everything requisite at one journey. If on a long 
cruise the large portion of his food supply may be 
kept in different parts of the canoe, but the box 



M cji^^mt 



should contain sufficient for at least three meafs^ and 
[can be replenished from the larger store when stop- 



id Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

ping for the night or at a camping place for any 
length of time. The larger the box that his stowage 
room will allow the greater will be the comfort of the 
canoeist. 

The box may be made of wood, tin or galvanized 
iron. The former costs but little, can be made by the 
cruiser himself, and if properly made and properly 
taken care of, should answer the purpose ; but a box 
of either japanned or painted tin or galvanized iron 
will stand much knocking about without fracture, and 
is therefore preferable when its expense is no objec- 
tion. Of course it must be water-tight, and if made 
of wood the nicest joining and dove-tailing must be 
done, and it should be varnished insfde and out with 
shellac or boat varnish. Arbitrary dimensions cannot 
be given because of the varying sizes of canoes and 
the different amounts of provisions carried on cruises, 
therefor^ let each canoeist first determine what 
amount and variety of eatables he will carry, and 
then construct the box according to his needs and his 
stowage room in the cockpit. If made of wood quar- 
ter inch or ^ stuff (pine) will do, and if the box is to 
be used as a seat the top and bottom pieces should be 
heavier, say \ of an inch. The cover should be two 
inches deep and the handle by which the box is carried 
should be a thin, wide, flat strap tacked to the cover. 
If the box is not used as a seat but is stowed under 
the deck it will be found an advantage to have the 
flanges of the cover fall over the side pieces of the 
box and the strap tacked to one end piece, carried over 
the cover and fastened by a hook to an eye in the 



Canoeist* s Cooking Outfit. li 

other end piece in reach of the hand, so that the cover 
may be removed and articles obtained from the box 
without taking it from under the deck. If used as a 
seat the cover may be hinged on one side and two 
hooks fastened at the ends on the other, and for the 
back rest two pieces of three-quarter inch pine are 
screwed to the sides, running aft horizontally six 
or eight inches from the aftermost end of the box, holes 
being bored in them an inch apart " athwartship " and 
cut opposite each other, 
through which a quarter- 
inch brass rod is passed for 
the back rest to play on. 
As the lower end- of the 
back rest strikes the end of 
the box near the floor when 
in use, it may be " slanted " 

as inclination demands by changing the brass rod 
from one set of holes to another. 

To carry the provisions in the box so that they will 
not mix or spill, several water-tight tins should be 
used. The Consolidated Fruit Jar Company, 49 
Warren Street, New York, makes tin screw-tops for 
jars and canisters that are perfectly water-tight. Send 
for several of these tops, of assorted sizes, and have a 
tinsmith make the tin cans of the dimensions you 
desire, so that they will nest in the box closely. The 
same company will also furnish you with a pint or 
quart earthen jar with water-tight screw-top, in which 
butter may be _kept sweet for a long time in hot 
weather, and which may be enveloped in a net and 



t± Canoe and Camp Cooker j/. 

lowered to the bottom of the river or lake without fear 
of its leaking. 

In the tin cans may be carried coffee, tea (or cocoa), 
sugar, flour (or meal), rice and alcohol. (A special 
screw-top is made for fluid cans.) Pepper and salt 
are in small spice boxes with two covers,^ the one 
underneath being perforated. Eggs are safest carried 
in the tins with the flour, coffee and rice ; bread and 
bacon (or salt pork) are wrapped in macintosh and 
put near the top of the chest ; the vinegar goes in a 
whisky flask (mark it to avoid mistakes), and canned 
goods, condensed milk, baking powder, etc., in their 
own cans. The alcohol stove and utensils necessary 
to cook a meal should go in the box, such as coffee- 
pot, cup, fork, knife, spoon, frying pan and plates^ 
The coffee pot should be of small size, with handle 
and lip riveted. If soldered, they are likely to. melt 
off. Cups or plates should be of tin or granite ware. 
The fork and knife have their sheaths of leather 
inside the box cover. The plates should nest in the 
frying pan, which should have no handle, and is 
fastened inside the chest cover by two buttons, so 
that it may be readily released. Next the knife and 
fork have a sheath for a pair of small blacksmith's 
pliers. This instrument serves as a handle to the 
frying pan and a lifter for everything on the fire, and 
can always be kept cool. A three-quart tin or granite 
ware pail is necessary for stews, and two smaller ones 
may be nested in it, of two-quart and three-pint 
capacity, respectively. Put the can of condensed 
milk in the smallest pail. It will be out of the way, 



Cancels fs Cooking Outfit, 13 

and won't make the rest of the things in the chest 
sticky. If you carry potatc^, onions or other vege- 
tables, always have enough in the chest for three 
meals. The surplus supplies of provisions, such as 
vegetables, extra bread, crackers, flour, meal, pork or 
bacon, etc, should be carried in waterproof bags, and 
they can then be stowed wherever necessary to 
properly trim the canoe. These waterproof bags 
may be used also for clothing and blankets. They 
are made of unbleached muslin, sewn in a lap seam, 
with a double row of stitches. When sewn they are 
dipped in water and slightly shaken to remove the 
drops, and then while wet a mixture of equal parts of 
boiled oil, raw oil and turpentine is applied to the 
outside with a brush. This takes about a week to 
become thoroughly dry, and then another coat is put 
on without dampening the cloth, and if a^ little liquid 
drier is added to the mixture, this coat will dry in 
four or five days. Having prepared several bags, the 
provisions, clothing, blankets, etc., are put in the bag^ 
and its mouth is inserted in that of another bag of the 
same size, the latter being drawn on like a stocking as 
far as it will go. If several bags are used instead of 
one or two large ones, the canoe can be trimmed and 

+ packed to better advantage. 
■^ A canoeist's portable oven is made of two small 
basins, one of which has " ears " riveted to its rim, so 
that when it is placed bottom up on the other the ears 
will spring over the rim of the second basin, thus 
making an oven that is not air-tight, allowing gases to 
escape. The basins should be made of sheet-iron,

and, as their interiors can easily be kept clean, they 
answer very well for s^up dishes. Instructions for 

(baking in them will be given later on. These should 
not go in the provision chest, as they will smut every- 
thing with which they come in contact. Butter, I 
have found, keeps better in its jar outside of the 
chest than in. Outside, too, are kept a small jug of 
molasses, and a jug of fresh water, if cruising on the 
" briny." 

There is no perfect canoe stove. The " flamme 
ioxci " is probably as good as any. It takes up a 
little more room than the folding " pocket " variety, 
and it does not give more heat ; but it burns for a 
longer time, and is not top-heavy when a heavy pot or 
pan is set on it. For cooking in large utensils have three 
of these flamme forc^ alcohol lamps, light them and 
place them side by side, and you can cook in this way 
a dozen slapjacks at once on a big griddle, if you like. 
Danforth, the fluid man, makes a small canoe stove 
*^ ' that would be preferable to all others if his fluid were 
^ obtainable at all the corners of the earth that canoe- 
S ists frequent ; but unfortunately it is not. Beware of 
" folding stoves " to use ashore and burn wood in. 
They are the greatest possible nuisances — smutty, 
red-hot and cumbersome. Don't carry an oil stove. 
But if you really must, put the nasty thing in a large 
bucket, and only remove it from this receptacle when 
absolutely necessary. 

Now as to eatables in general, besides what I have 
already mentioned, condensed milk is a good thing, 
but condensed coffee, condensed eggs and condensed

beef are abominations. Self-raising or Hecker's pre- 
pared flour, wheat, rye, Indian or Graham, is easily 
made into bread and slapjacks. - The directions come 
with the packages. Pilot bread will keep an indefinite 
time, and is not so unpalatable as hard-tack. Indian 
meal is very nutritious and easily made up, as it 
requires nothing to. lighten it ; scald it before using 
when it is not fresh. Canned tomatoes, corn, fruits, 
beans, soups, salmon, etc., are easy to prepare, and 
can be stored as ballast in the canoe. Mr. Hicks, of 
O* the Toronto Canoe Club, prepares certain kinds of 
food in cans for ballast as follows, according to the 
American Canoeist : 

" Get a number of flat square tin cans made like 
oyster cans, of a handy size to lie under your floor 
boards. Then cook a turkey, some chickens, a sirloin 
of beef, etc. Cut the hot meat up into large dice- 
shaped pieces, and put it in the tins hot, then pour 
melted fat in till the tins are full, and then solder 
them tight. Get as much meat in as you can before 
putting in the fat. Put up fruit in square flat cans in 
the same way. There is your ballast, and heavy stuff 
it is. When the provisions run short let the crew feed 
on the ballast. The preparation described is far 
more nutritious than canned corned beef, is more 
palatable, and will keep indefinitely — that is, through- 
out a very long cruise." 
K -^ ^ I have not tried this method of preserving provis- 

ions, but the theory is excellent, and I do not see why 
it would not be a feasible scheme. The Brunswick 
canned soups are the cheapest made, are easily pre- 



k

pared and as wholesome as any ; but I have known 
squeamish canoeists who would not use them because 
they didn't like the looks of the powder to which they 
are desiccated. Dried beef, comedbeef, le mons and 
sardines make good additions to an outfit Potatoes, 
onions and other vegetables should be procured en 
route as needed, if possible. 

As it may puzzle some neophytes to know how much 
of each article of food to take on a cruise, I give be- 
low the exact amount of provisions I carried on a 
cruise of a week last autumn. I did not run short of 
anything at the end of the week, but I had not pro- 
visions enough left for three square meals : i lb. sugar 
(cut loaf) ; yi lb. tea; i lb. flour; ij^ lbs. crackers 
^ lb. lard ; ^ lb. rice ; J^ lb. bacon ; ^ lb. coffee 
I lb. butter ; i can condensed milk ; 3 loaves bread 
^ peck potatoes ; ^ peck meal ; i pint molasses ; 2 
oz. pepper ; i bottle pickles ; i bottle yeast powder ; 
I qt. salt. 



CHAPTER II. 



Soups. — Canned Soups. — The Brunswick Goods Cheap, 
Wholesome, AND Convenient. — Huckins' Soups. — Oyster, 
Clam, Onion, and Tomato Soups. 

CANOEISTS will hardly take the time and trouble to 
make soups out of meats and vegetables, unless 
they are in a permanent camping place for some length 
of time. Nearly all soups require several hours to cook 
properly, as they must be boiled very slowly to retain 
the aroma of the ingredients used. 

Canned soups, therefore, are the handiest for the 
canoeist or single-hand cruiser. I can recommend the 
Brunswick variety as cheap, convenient, wholesorrie 
and easy to prepare if the directions on the cans are 
implicitly followed. Any variation from these instruc- 
tions, however, is certain to result in an unpalatable 
mess. The higher priced soups, Huckins* and other 
varieties, are more like home-made soups than the 
Brunswick kind, and hence a fastidious taste will pre- 
fer them. They are bulkier to carry, but are quite as 
easily prepared, and I would recommend those made 
by Huckins as especially good. The great objection 
to them is their high price. 

There are a few good soups that can be prepared 



1 8 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

from materials readily accessible to the canoeist, and 
in a comparatively short time. These are : 

Oyster Soup. 

Put a quart of milk and a piece of butter as large as 
an ^%% into the pot and heat gradually. When hot, 
stir in the strained liquor of one pint of oysters, very 
gradually, to prevent the milk from curdling, then one- 
quarter pound of crushed crackers or bread 
crumbs. When it has come to a boil put in the oys- 
ters (one pint), and let it cook till the edges of the oys- 
ters curl up, when it should be seasoned and served. 

Clam Soup. 

Exactly the same as oyster soup, using clams instead 
of oysters. 

Onion Soup. 

Put three tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying pan, 
cut six large onions in slices, and stir them into the 
butter over the fire till they begin to cook. Then 
cover tight and set them where they will simmer 
slowly for half an hour. Put a quart of milk with a 
tablespoonful of butter on to boil, and while this is 
doing stir into the onions a tablespoonful of flour while 
they are simmering. Turn the mixture into the boil- 
ing milk and cook quarter of an hour, seasoning with 
salt and pepper. If an old tin pan is handy that you 
can use for the purpose, the soup will be improved by 



Soups, 19 

knocking small holes in the bottom of the pan, ttius 
making a colander, and straining the soup through it, 
afterwards adding the well-beaten yolks of four eggs 
and cooking three minutes longer. 

Tomato Soup. 

Mix one tablespoonful of flour and a piece of butter 
the size of an ^%% into a smooth paste, and if you have 
onions, chop up fine one medium-sized one. Prepare 
about one pound of tomatoes by scalding, peeling and 
slicing them (the same amount of canned tomatoes may 
be used), and put all the ingredients with a pinch of 
salt into one pint of cold water. Boil gently for an 
hour, stirring frequently enough to dissolve the toma- 
toes and prevent burning, then stir in one cup of 
boiled milk, and let it come again to a boil, constantly 
stirring. Season and serve. The soup will be good 
if the milk is omitted. 



CHAPTER III. 

Fish. — Fish Caught in Muddy Streams. — Kill your Fish 
AS Soon as Caught. — Fish Grubs. — Fish Fried, 
Planked, Skewered, and Boiled. — Fish Sauce, Fish 
Roe, Shell-Fish. 

FISH should naturally have a prominent place in 
the canoeist's larder. Few streams that he will 
navigate are entirely destitute of edible fish, and a 
few minutes spent in angling will amply repay the 
cruiser. 

Fish caught out of muddy streams have an unpleasant 
taste, and their flavor can be improved by soaking 
them half an hour or more in strong salted water. 
Fish should be killed as soon as caught by a sharp 
rap on the back just aft of the head with a stick or 
the handle of your big knife, not only in justice to the 
fish, but because he tastes better, for the same reason 
that a butchered steer is preferable to one smothered 
to death. 

You may find grubs in fish along the backbone in 
July and August. You will generally remove them 
by taking out the backbone and its branches. But if 
you don't get them all out, never mind ; they are good 
to eat ; but if any one of the party is squeamish, tell 
him you have got them all out anyway : he won't 



Fish, 21 

know any better after they are cooked. It is supposed 
that everybody has known how to clean fish ever since 
he was a schoolboy, so we will proceed at once to the 
instructions for cooking. 

Fried Fish. 

Small fish may be fried whole, but large ones should 
be cut up. Have enough pork fat or lard bubbling 
hot in the frying-pan to well cover the fish. Smear 
the fish well with dry corn meal or flour, or, what is 
better, dip it into well-beaten ^%^ and then into bread 
or » cracker crumbs, and fry both sides to a clear 
golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with pepper and salt 
just as it is turning brown. 

Planked Fish. 

Shad, flounders, sunfish or any other "flat" fish 
may be " planked." Cut off the head and tail, split 
open the back, but do not cut clear through the belly, 
leaving the fish so that it may be opened wide like a 
book and tacked on a plank or piece of bark. Tack 
some thin slices of bacon or pork to the end of the 
fish that will be uppermost when before the fire, and, 
if you like, a few slices of raw onion sprinkled with 
pepper and salt. Sharpen one end of the plank and 
drive it into the ground, before a bed of hot coals. 
Catch the drippings in a tin cup or large spoon and 
baste the fish continually till it smells so good you 
can't wait another instant to eat it. It is then done. 



I 



22 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

Skewered Trout. 

Sharpen a small, straight stick, and on it skewer 
small trout and thin slices of bacon or pork in alterna- 
tion. Hold over a bed of hot coals and keep con- 
stantly turning, so that the juices will not be lost in the 
fire. A very few minutes will suffice to cook the trout. 

BoUed Fish. 

Tie or pin the fish (which should not weigh less 
than three pounds) in a clean cloth. If the pot is too 
small for the fish, skewer the tail into the mouth. 
Put into enough boiling water to cover it about an 
inch, and simmer steadily until done. Some fish ooil 
quicker than others ; as a general rule those of white 
flesh requiring less time than those of a darker tinge. 
If a couple of tablespoonfuls of salt and four ditto of 
vinegar are put into the water the fish will cook sooner. 
About twenty-five minutes are necessary for a three- 
pound fish, and over that six minutes extra to every 
pound. An underdone fish is not fit to eat, and one 
boiled too long is insipid. When the meat separates 
easily from the backbone it is cooked just right. Take 
it up, remove the cloth carefully, and pour over it the 
following hot 

Fish Sauoe. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of butter and two ditto of 
flour into a hot frying pan over the fire and mix them 
together with a spoon into a smooth paste. Pour 
over very gradually about a pint of the water in which 



Fish. 23 

the fish was boiled, stirring it well in. Boil up once 
and season with pepper and salt. If an acid taste is 
desired, add a few drops of vinegar. 

Boiled Fish Boe. 

Wash and wipe the roes with a soft cloth. Wrap in 
a cloth and boil the same as fish. Or, they maybe 
tied inside the fish with a string and boiled with it 

Fried Fish Boe. 

Prepare as above, dredge in meal or flour, and fry 
exactly as fish. 

Soft Crabs. 

Have enough boiling hot grease in a pan over a 
hot fire to cover the crabs. Throw them in as soon 
as possible after they are taken, with a little salt. Let 
them brown and turn them once. When done cut off 
the gills or " dead men's fingers," and serve on toast. 

Hard Shell Crabs. 

These are best steamed. Boil two cups of water in 
your largest pail. Put in two or three large handfuls 
of grass and then the crabs, as soon as possible after 
they are caught. Over them put more grass, and, 
covering the pail, let them steam thoroughly over the 
fire for twenty minutes. When done, eat all except 
the shell, the gills and the stomach, which last is in an 
easily distinguished sack. Be sure to have sufficient 
water in the pail to keep up the steam for the requisite 
time.

Eried Oysters. 

Strain the liquor from the o)RSters. Crush crackers 
into fine crumbs ; or, if you have no crackers, toast 
some slices of bread and crush them fine. Beat up 
an egg (both white and yolk) in a tin cup with a 
spoon. Dip the oysters into the beaten ^%gy then 
roll them in the crumbs, and put over the fire in a 
pan of boiling fat over half an inch deep. Turn when 
brown on one side, and let the other side brown. If 
the oysters are small do not prepare them singly, but 
place them two together (the large portions at opposite 
ends), then immerse them in the ^%% and crumbs 
together. If the crumbs do not readily adhere, pat 
the oysters gently while rolling them in the crumbs. 

Blanketed Oysters. 

Get the largest oysters you can find, cut fat bacon 
into very thin slices, wrap an oyster in each slice, and 
skewer with a small stick. Heat a frying pan very 
hot, put in your oysters, and cook long enough to just 
crisp the bacon — not over two minutes — taking care 
that they do not burn. Serve immediately without 
removing the skewers. 



CHAPTER IV. 

Meats and Game. — ^Salt Pork. — Ham and Eggs. — Broiling 
AND Boiling Meats. — Pigeons, Squirrels, Ducks,Grouse, 
Woodcock, Rabbits, Frogs, etc. 

IN selecting salt pork pick out that which is smooth 
and dry. Damp, clammy pork is unwholesome. 
Canned corn beef is palatable, and useful in making 
hash, but is sometimes poisonous from the solder used 
in sealing the cans. If canned beef is carried, use 
only the portion that does not touch the metal of the 
cans, throwing away the remainder. 

Fried Salt Fork (or Bacon). 

Slice thin, put in frying pan with cold water enough 
to cover, let it come to a boil and boil two or three 
minutes ; then turn off the water and fry brown on 
both sides ; or, soak one hour in cold water, then roll 
in bread or cracker crumbs and fry with a little butter 
or lard in the pan. 

Broiled Salt Pork. 

Slice thin, and broil on the end of a green switch 
held over the coals, using extra care that the smoke 
and flame from the drippings do not reach the pork. 



26 Canoe and Camp Cookery* 

Ham and Eggs, 

Fry the ham first, the same as pork or bacon, and 
fry the eggs in the fat left in the pan. Break each 
^%Z separately into a cup, and thence transfer it to 
the pan, by which means the yolks are kept intact and 
bad eggs are discovered before it is too late. While 
the eggs are frying dip up some of the fat with a 
spoon and pour it over the tops of the eggs. 

Broiled Steaks. 

If the steak is tough, beat it on both sides, but not 
enough to tear the meat and allow the juices to escape. 
Sharpen a green switch at the end, secure the steak on 
it, and place over a bed of hot coals, turning fre- 
quently. Do not let the escaping juices set fire to the 
meat. Season, after it is done, with pepper and salt, 
and if a gravy is desired, put a half teaspoonful of 
salt, half as much pepper, and a piece of butter or fat 
as large as a duck's ^%% into a hot dish, and add two 
tablespoonfuls of boiling water. Pour it over the 
steak slowly, so that every part of the latter will be 
moistened. 

Broiling in a Frying Pan. 

Broiling can be done as well with a frying pan as 
with a gridiron, and all the juices are preserved. 
Heat the empty pan very hot first, then put in the 
meat to be broiled, cover over with a tin plate, and 
turn the meat often in the pan. 



Meats and Game, 2J 

Boiled Meat. 

Put the meat into enough boiling water so that the 
former will be a little more than covered. Cover the 
pot and boil till cooked, which will take about fifteen 
minutes for every pound of meat. Skim constantly 
while boiling, and turn the meat several times. Re- 
plenish when necessary with boiling water. One 
teaspoonful of salt for each five pounds of meat 
should be put into the pot a short time before the 
meat is done. If there is a layer of fat on top after 
the meat is cold, remove it. Beef or venison may be 
used for frying. 

Fried Pigeons. 

Dress them, parboil until they are tender, then cut 
off the legs and wings, slice off the breast pieces, roll 
in flour or meal and fry in hot pork fat till they are 
nicely browned. Grouse, ducks, quail, snipe and 
plover may also be fried, but are better cooked as 
given below. Snipe, quail and plover need no 
parboiling. 

Fried Sqidrrels. 

Skin and clean, cutting off heads, tails and feet. 
Parboil and fry, same as pigeons. 

Boast Quail, Snipe or Plover. 

Dress and impale each on a stick with a piece of 
fat pork in each bird. Set the stick in the ground 



28 Cande and Camp Cookery, 

before a big bed of live coals in a slanting position so 
that the heat will fall evenly on all portions of the 
bird, and turn frequently till a sharp sliver will easily 
pass through the breast. Catch the drippings in a 
tin cup and pour over the birds again and again, and 
if they are served on toast pour the drippings also on 
the toast. The blacksmith's pliers mentioned in Chap- 
ter I. will come in handy for turning the birds before 
the fire on their sticks and holding the cup to catch 
the drippings. Without this tool the cook's hands are 
likely to be roasted by the time the birds are done. 

Boast Ducks and Grouse. 

Parboil till tender, then roast as above. 

Boast Woodcock. 

Pick, but do not clean. Roast as above without 
parboiling. Remove the entrails after the bird is 
done. 

Babbits or Hares. 

These require considerable parboiling unless young. 
They may be fried like squirrels, cutting them into 
pieces, or made into stews. 

Stewed Babbit. 

After skinning and cleaning the rabbit cut it into 
pieces, and wash again in cold water. Mince an 



Meats and Game. , 29 

onion, cleanse and cut into small pieces one-half 
pound of fat salt pork, and put with the cut-up rabbit 
into a pot with about a pint of cold water. Season 
with pepper and salt, cover the pot and let it simmer 
till the flesh can be easily pierced with a sharp sliver. 
Take it up when done and set where it will keep warm, 
and make a gravy by adding to the water left in the 
pot one cup of boiling milk or water, stirring in gradu- 
ally one well-beaten ^%% and one or two tablespoonfuls 
of flour made into a smooth- paste with cold water. 
Boil one minute and then pour over the rabbit. This 
gravy will be nearly or quite as good if the ^g% is 
omitted. 

Stewed Ducks or Pigeons. 

Stew exactly the same as rabbits. The pork may 
be omitted without detracting from the edible quality 
of the dish. 

Frogs. 

Use only the hind legs of small frogs, but both the 
fore and hind legs of large ones. They are best 
broiled, but may be fried in butter. 



CHAPTER V. 



Vegetables. — Potatoes and Green Corn, Boiled, Fried, 
Roasted and Stewed. 



n^HE canoeist, whose stowage room is limited, will 
1 not carry with him a variety of vegetables, therefore 
completer directions for cooking these edibles will be 
left for Part II. of this book, and instructions will here 
be given only for the preparation of the potatoes, 
which he will most certainly carry, and green corn, 
which, in its season, he can obtain readily, if his cruise 
leads him through a farming country. These two 
articles will form the canoeist's mainstay in the vege- 
table line, and can be prepared in several appetizing 
ways. 

Boiled Potatoes. 

Small or medium-sized potatoes are preferable to 
large ones. Choose those with small eyes, as those 
with large eyes are generally about to sprout and are 
of poor quality. Do not pare unless they are very 
old, and in the latter case put them in cold water and 
allow it to boil. If they are of unequal size cut the 
large ones, so that they will boil evenly ; wash, cut out 
tad places and ejres, and slice off a piece of skjn a^ 



Vegetables, 31 

each pointed end. Put, unless old, into enough boil- 
ing salted water to cover them, and simmer steadily 
till a sliver will easily pierce the largest. Strain when 
done, and set the pot near the fire, shaking them occa- 
sionally to dry them. 

Mashed Potatoes. 

After boiling, peel and mash thoroughly with the 
bottom of a large bottle, working in pepper, salt, but- 
ter, and sufficient hot milk or water to make them into 
the consistency of soft dough. If mashed in an iron 
pot they will be discolored, but will taste just as good 
as if mashed in tin or earthenware. 

Boasted Potatoes. 

Wash and wipe them dry, and cut off the ends. 
Bury them in the ashes till a sliver will easily pierce 
them. Do not make the common mistake of putting 
them among the live coals of the fire, or they will 
be burned, not cooked through. 

Fried Cooked Potatoes. 

Peel and slice cold cooked potatoes, and put them 
into enough " screeching hot " lard or pork fat to 
cover the bottom of the pan. Stir frequently and fry 
slowly, seasoning with pepper and salt. 

4- Fried Baw Potatoes. 

Wash, peel, and slice very thin. Put few at a time 
into enough boiling fat to float the slice§. If too many 



32 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

are put in at one time they will chill the fat and will 
not fry evenly. Turn and fry a light brown on both 
sides. When done remove with a fork, leaving as 
much grease as possible, and shake them up in a 
covered dish to eliminate the grease still further. 

Stewed Potatoes. 

Cut cold boiled potatoes into pieces the size of a 
hickory nut, put them into enough boiling milk to 
cover them, and let them simmer slowly till the milk is 
nearly exhausted, stirring frequently to prevent burn- 
ing. Season with pepper, salt and butter. 

Sweet Potatoes 

Are cooked the same as Irish potatoes, but require 
longer time. See time table in Part II. 



Boiled Green Com. 

The sweetness of corn is better preserved in the 
boiling if the outer layer of husks only is stripped off. 
Turn back the inner husks and strip off the silk, then 
replace the inner husks and tie the ends. Put the 
corn into enough boiling salt water to cover it. Boil, 
if young, twenty-five minutes ; if old, nearly or quite 
twice as long. After half an hour's boiling, an ear 
had best be removed occasionally and the kernels 
prodded with a sliver, to see if they have cooked 
tender. Overboiling spoils corn. Drain off the water 
as soon as they are done. 



Vegetables. 33 

Fried Corn. 

Cut cold boiled corn from the cob, mix with mashed 
potatoes, and fry in butter or pork fat. 

Boasted Corn. 

Leave the ear in the husks, cover it well with the 
hot ashes, and let it remain from forty-five minutes to 
an hour. 

Stewed Corn. 

Cut the corn from the cob, put it into a pot, barely 
covering it with cold milk. Season it with pepper and 
salt, and if common field corn, with sugar. Cover 
and stew gently till very tender. 



CHAPTER VI. 

Coffee and Tea. — Mush, Johnnycake and Hokcake. — Slap- 
jacks, Corn Dodgers, Ash Cakes, Biscuits, Camp Bread. 
— Eggs. 

Coffee. 

THE simplest way to make good coffee is to put into 
the pot two tablespoonfuls of the ground and 
browned berry to each cupful of the beverage. Pour on 
cold water to the required amount, remove it from the 
fire when it first boils up, let it stand a few moments in a 
warm place, and then pour into the pot half a cup of 
cold water to settle it. 

Coffee, "No. 2, 

If the ground coffee is running low or the cook 
wishes to economize and has plenty of time and uten- 
sils, I will give him a recipe which requires much less 
of the berry to produce the required strength, as fol- 
lows : Put the dry coffee into the pot, and heat it, 
stirring it constantly. Then pour over it one quart of 
boiling water to every two tablespoonfuls of coffee, 
and set the pot where it will keep hot but not boil. 
After standing ten or fifteen minutes it is ready to 
drink. 



Tea, 35 

Tea. 

For most teas the right proportion is one tablespoon- 
ful of tea for every teacup that is to be drawn and one 
" for the pot." The simplest method of making it is 
to put cold water on the tea in the pot, set over the 
fire and let it almost boil. Just as it begins to steam 
remove it to a place less hot, where it will simmer and 
not boil for ^^^ minutes. If it boils or simmers too 
long the tannin will be dissolved, and the tea will have 
a disagreeable astringent taste. When the liquid is 
all used out of the pot I do not throw away the 
" grounds," but add one-half the quantity for the next 
drawing, and so on till the pot is one-third full of 
grounds, when it is all emptied and the pot thoroughly 
washed. . 

Cornmeal Mush. 

The main difficulties in making good cornmeal 
mush are the care necessary to prevent the formation 
of lumps and the long time required to cook it. The 
surest way to avoid lumps is to mix the meal first with 
cold water enough to make a thin batter, and then 
pour this batter into the pot of boiling water (slightly 
salted) very gradually, so as not to stop the boiling 
process. Sufficient of the batter should be stirred in 
to make a thin mush, and the latter should then be 
boiled until it is of such consistency that it will hang 
well together when taken out with a spoon. The 
longer it is allowed to boil the better it will be, and if 
long boiling makes it too thick, add more boiling 



36 Canoe and Camp Cookery, 

water. It can be advantageously boiled two hours, 
but is eatable after twenty minutes* boil. If it is 
sprinkled into the pot of boiling water dry, do so very 
gradually and stir it constantly to prevent its lumping. 

Fried Cold Mush. 

Cut cold cornmeal mush into slices half an inch 
thick, and fry on both sides in boiling pork fat or 
butter. Or, dip each slice into beaten ^%g (salted), 
then into bread or cracker crumbs, and fry. If fried 
in lard add a little salt. 

Oatmeal Mush 

Is made the same as cornmeal mush, but must always 
be sprinkled dry into the pot of boiling water. 



Johnnycake. 

Make a thick batter by mixing warm (not scalding) 
water or milk with one pint of cornmeal, and mix in 
with this a small teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoon- 
ful of melted lard. Grease your bake-tins (described 
in Chapter I.) thoroughly with lard or butter, set the 
Johnnycake batter in one, cover over with the other, 
and bury the oven amongst the hot coals and ashes of 
the camp-fire, heaping the coals around it so as to have 
an equal heat on all portions of the oven. In twenty 
minutes dig out the oven, open it with the pliers and 
test the Johnnycake. It should be thoroughly baked 
in a good fire in from twenty to thirty minutes. If 
the meal is mixed with scalding water it will be lumpy 
and difficult to work into a batter. 



_i 



Hoe Cakesi ^7 



Hoe Cakes. 

Johnnycake batter, thinned down with more warm 
water or milk, may be fried the same as slapjacks. 

Slapjacks. 

To properly cook slapjacks the frying pan should 
be perfectly clean and smooth inside. If it is not, too 
much grease is required in cooking. Scrape it after 
each panful is cooked, and then only occasional greas- 
ing will be required, and this is best done with a clean 
rag containing butter. Drop thin batter in with a 
spoon, so that the cake will be very thin. Disturb it 
as little as possible, and when the cake is cooked firm 
on one side, turn it and cook on the other. 

Cornmeal Slapjacks. 

One quart of cold water is mixed with meal enough 
to make a thin batter, one teaspoonful of salt and one 
or two teaspoonfuls of baking powder having been 
stirred into the latter. The addition of one or two 
well-beaten eggs will improve it. Cook on a very hot 
pan, as above. 

Wheat Slapjacks. 

Make as above, except using wheat flour, and add- 
ing last of all one heaping tablespoonful of melted 
lard or butter, thoroughly stirred in. 



38 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

t Hecker's Flour Slapjacks. 

Mix well one pint of Hecker's prepared flour with 
one-half pint of cold milk or water. Cook as above. 

Corn Dodgers. 

Mix one pint of 'corn meal, one small teaspoonful 
of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar with warm (not 
scalding) water enough to make a moderately stiff 
batter. Make into flat cakes about three-quarters of 
an inch thick, and fry in boiling fat till brown. Fried 
in bacon fat and eaten with the fried bacon they are 
very palatable. 

Corn Pone or Ash Cakes. 

If unprovided with the portable oven or bake tin 
recommended in Chapter I., mix up a pint of corn 
meal with water and a pinch of salt into a stiff dough, 
make into cakes, and set them on a clean, hot stone 
close to the coals of a hot fire. When the outside of 
the cakes has hardened a little cover them completely 
in hot ashes. In fifteen to twenty-five minutes rake 
them out, brush off the ashes, and devour quickly. 
Any ashes adhering after the brushing process can be 
readily removed by cutting out the irregularities in 
the crust where they have lodged. The writer has 
known a party of ladies, who could scarcely be induced 
to taste these cakes at first, become so fond of them 
after a trial as to insist upon having them three times 
a day for a week in camp. 



Baking Powder Biscuits. y^ 

Baking Powder Biscuits* 

Put one pint of flour into a deep vessel, mix into it 
two large teaspoonfuls of baking powder * and a pinch 
of salt ; then rub in one small teaspoonful of lard or 
butter, lessening the amount of salt if the latter is 
Used, and add enough cold water or milk to make a 
soft dough. Handle as little as possible, but roll into 
a sheet about three-quarters of an inch thick, and cut 
into round cakes with an empty tin cup. Lay the bis- 
cuits close together in a well-greased tin, and bake a 
few minutes in the coals, as described above for 
Johnnycake. 

Hecker's Flour Biscuits 

Require only the mixing of the flour with water, and 
are then ready to bake. 

Quick Camp Bread. 

Make a biscuit dough as above, and roll it to a 
thickness of half an inch. Grease a frying-pan and 
set it over the hot embers till the grease begins to 
melt. Then put the dough into the pan and set it on 
the fire, shaking it frequently to prevent the dough 
from adhering. When the crust has formed on the 
bottom, take the bread out of the pan and prop it up 
on edge, close to the fire, turning it occasionally to 
insure its being baked through. Or, turn the bread in 



* See note on baking powder in the chapter of " Hints.

the frying pan until it is cooked through. This bread 
will not keep soft long, and the writer prefers, when 
depending for any length of time upon his own bak- 
ing, to make 

Unleavened Bread. 

This is the kind almost wholly used by coasting 
vessels, and is cooked as above in a frying-pan, even 
when there is a galley-stove with a good hot oven on 
board the vessel. The dough is mixed up with a 
quart of wheat flour, one teaspoonful of lard, a tea- 
spoonful of salt and sufficient water to make it stiff. 
«4»It is then beaten or hammered lustily on a board or 
smooth log until it becomes elastic. 4-When cut up into 
biscuit it can be baked in the portable oven among 
the coals. It is called " Maryland Biscuit " along the 
Potomac and Chesapeake. 

Fried and Boiled Eggs 

Are so easy to prepare that no instruction is necessary 
in these familiar methods of cooking them. 

Poached Eggs. 

Into a frying pan nearly full of boiling water contain- 
ing a teaspoonful of salt slip carefully the eggs one by 
one, breaking each previously into a cup. Keep them 
on the surface of the water, if possible, and boil gently 
three or four minutes, dipping up some of the water 
with a spoon and pouring it over the tops of the eggs. 
Serve on toast. 



Scrambled £ggs. /^i 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Break the eggs into a cup to insure their freshness, 
and throw them into the frying pan with a lump of 
butter and salt and pepper. Stir over a fire of coals un- 
til they are almost hard. Do not break the yolks at 
first.

AND Utensils. — Camp Stoves, Ice-boxes and Hair Mat- 
tresses. — The Bed of " Browse." — How to make a Cook-

THE remarks given on outfit in Chapter I. of Part I. 
are, many of them, as well adapted to camp as to 
canoe cookery. The utensils carried for cooking in a 
permanent camp, and for more than one person, will 
of course exceed in number those used by the canoeist, 
but there will be few additional articles really neces- 
sary, even with the varied and extensive bill-of-fare 
that the possibilities of a three weeks' camp in one place 
suggest. Even if you have teams and lumber- wagons 
to carry your outfit into the woods it is better to go 
light as possible. With few things to find places for 
the camp can be kept neat and ship-shape, and every- 
thing will be handy ; while the chances are that a por- 
tion of a large and varied outfit will be wasted. 



Camp Cooking Outfit, 43 

Two friends and myself go regularly into camp for 
three weeks with no added utensils to those mentioned 
in the canoe outfit except an iron pot and a Dutch 
oven, and even these additions are seldom used. A 
large cooking outfit for a camp can be best packed in 
a large pack basket, such as is generally used in the 
Adirondacks and Maine woods ; but these receptacles 
are not waterproof, therefore I would recommend that 
the eatables themselves be carried in waterproofed 
muslin bags, each variety having its own bag. All 
together may then be packed in basket, chest or knap- 
sack, as desired. Butter will keep sweet longer in an 
earthen jar with water-tight cover, as described on 
page II, than in any other receptacle I know of. It 
can be enveloped in a net and lowered to the bottom 
of a lake or river, or set in a cold spring, or tucked 
away in the coolest corner of a little cellar dug into a 
side hill and lined with clean birch bark. If I carry a 
dozen or two of eggs into the woods with me I let 
them ride in a tin pail along with plenty of corn meal, 
and seldom find a broken one among them. 

A good many campers — and especially lady campers 
— think it necessary to carry a camp stove ; some peo- 
ple go into the woods with an ice-box and a ton of ice ; 
and others bring with them bedsteads and hair mat- 
tresses. I do not camp with such people, and I think 
every true woodsman will agree with me that these 
deluded persons do not enjoy to the full the pleasure 
and wholesome exhilaration of real camp life. A bed 
of spruce or hemlock browse, properly " shingled " and 
of a good depth, is the cleanest, softest, most fragrant 



44 Canoe and Camp Cookery, 

and healthful couch in the world. If I never camped 
for any other reason, I would go once a year for the 
express purpose of enjoying for a brief season the 
delicious odor and natural elastic softness of this best 
of beds. 

I have never felt the need of ice or ice-box in all 
my camping experience. A cold spring of water keeps 
my butter sweet, and I never send to town for butch- 
ered meat ; if I did perhaps I should find a refrigera- 
tor useful. 

Now. as to camp stoves. A camp of lumbermen 
will find a stove of some sort a time-saving utensil, for 
but little time can be spared from their work in the 
woods to prepare meals, and a dinner can be unques- 
tionably got quicker on a stove than with an open 
fire. But to a party of pleasure outers whose time in 
camp is not of so great importance, a camp stove is a 
superfluous piece of furniture. It is unwieldy to carry, 
smutty to handle, and makes a camp look like a sum- 
mer kitchen in a back-yard. Every necessary culinary 
operation can be performed equally well or even bet- 
ter without it, if the camper knows now to properly 
make a cooking camp-fire. 

The fire, in summer, should not be made so close 
to the tent as to make that sleeping and lounging 
place too warm, nor should it be made so far away as 
to tire the cook from running back and forth with the 
cooking utensils and grub. Two green logs, five or 
six feet long and eight to twelve inches in diameter, 
of a nearly even thickness throughout, are laid on a 
level piece of ground side by side, about a foot apart 



Camp Cooking Outfit, 45 

at one end, and touching at the other, thus forming 
an elongated V. With a hatchet hew them on their 
upper sides until the surface is level enough to sup- 
port pots and pans in safety. Between these logs 
build your fire. This should not be done carelessly, 
but methodically and with patience. Begin with only 
as many dry shavings as you can grasp in your hand. 
When these are ablaze, add shavings and bits of dry 
wood of a little larger size, and then those a little 
larger than the last, and so on, increasing the size of 
the sticks very gradually and leading the fire by de- 
grees until it covers all the space between the logs. 

When the fire is well under way and blazing brightly 
at all points, pile on it plenty of split sticks, short, and 
as near a uniform size as possible, and let them all 
burn to coals before cooking is commenced. If some 
of the sticks are large and some small, they will not 
burn evenly, and by the time the larger ones have be- 
come coals, the coals of the smaller ones will have 
become ashes. And if the sticks are round instead 
of split, they will not catch fire so easily, and will 
nest so close together as to give insufficient draft. 
Driftwood will do to start a fire, but it should never 
be used after the blaze is well going, because it 
burns to ashes instead of coals. The best coals 
result from burning hard wood. Never put a 
cooking utensil on the fire until the smoke and 
blaze have ceased. When you have a good bed of 
coals set the coffee pot on near where the logs join, 
and the frying pan, large pot, etc., where the logs 
are further apart. If there is much wind, ashes will 



46 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

be blown about to some extent, and it is best to 
always keep the open end of the " range " to wind- 
ward, as the frying pan is generally set on this end, 
while the coffee pot and other pots being covered, can 
stand a shower of ashes without harm to their con- 
tents. As fast as one dish is cooked, set it on one of 
the logs where it will keep warm, and use the handy 
blacksmith's pliers to heap up the live coals under 
other dishes that are not cooking fast enough. 

These pliers can be made by any blacksmith, and 
should be from twelve to eighteen inches in length, 
and quite broad in the gripping part, which may with 
advantage be curved to a slight angle. I always use 
a frying pan without handle for compactness, and can 
lift it from any side of the fire with the pliers, which 
are always cool. I even grip the coffee pot wiA them 
and pour the coffee for the whole party without touch- 
ing it with my hands, saving many a scorch thereby. 
It is a handy tool in making repairs to boats, and in 
various other ways proves its value as a necessary 
part of the camp outfit. The coffee pot should not 
have a spout, but a lip, riveted on, near its topmost 
edge. The handle should also be riveted, and should 
set as near as possible to the top of the pot. A wire 
bale may be attached for handiness in lifting. 

The cooking range above described will suffice for 
nearly all branches of camp cookery. On it one can 
fry, broil and boil. When a boil is to be kept up for 
hours, however, as in cooking beans, greens, and some 
soups and stews, it will be necessary to set up a forked 
stake at each end of the fire, hang the kettle on a 



• Camp Cooking Outfit, 47 

dross-piece between, slnd keep up the fire beneath by 
constant feeding and attention. Do not let the blaaje 
mount so high as to burn or char the cross-piece. 

The fire for baking should be made apart from the 
range. A hole in the ground a little more than deep 
enough to contain the bake-kettle or Dutch oven 
should be dug, and of sufficient diameter to allow four 
or five inches' space on each side of the oven when it 
is in the hole. Build up a good fire in the hole, and 
when you have a large quantity of hot coals and ashes, 
dig out all but a thick layer on the bottom, set in your 
oven, and pack it all around and on top with the coals 
and ashes. Cover the whole with a piece of turf or 
some earth. When baking without an oven, as fish in 
clay, a bird in its feathers, or a 'possum in its own 
hide, dig out nearly all the coals, put some green grass 
or leaves in the bottom, then the fish, bird or beast, 
then more grass or leaves, then coals and ashes, then 
earth, and lastly build a small fire on top and keep it 
burning steadily. 

In all the baking recipes recommended in this 
book a certain time is given for each operation. This 
time mentioned is only approximate, and it will be 
found to vary a few minutes, according to the amount 
of coal used, the kind of firewood, etc. The time 
necessary to bake a given thing can only be learned 
exactly by practical experience ; but this experience 
will teach the cook all he needs to know after the first 
two or three attempts. 

In closing my remarks on fires I would suggest that 
the best wood to be obtained for cooking fires is that 



4? Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

from hard wood trees that have fallen in the woods or 
been cut down, and have lain long enough to become 
well seasoned. If this is used the fire will stand any 
ordinary rain, and the camper will not be compelled 
to resort to his alcohol stove under shelter for any 
thing short of the equinoctial storm. If wood is 
damp, a few drops of kerosene, gun oil or alcohol 
sprinkled on it will be a valuable aid in starting a fire. 

I have no love for kerosene stoves. The alcohol 
" Aamme forcd " is more compact, gives a stronger 
heat (have two, set side by side), and is perfectly 
clean. If, however, you must take along a kerosene 
stove, the wind-protected kind manufactured by Adams 
& Westlake (s East Fourteenth Street, New York, and 
78 Washington Street, Boston) will probably be found 
the most suitable. Neither the kerosene nor the alcohol 
stoves should be used when an outdoor Are can be 
built. 

A camp dining-table can be made by driving down 
four forked stakes in the corners of an imaginary rec- 
tangle. Connect the end stakes with cross-pieces, and 
lay planks from one cross-piece to the other. Make it 
just high enough to get the legs and feet under com- 
fortably when sitting upon the ground, and build it 
away from the fire. A camp chest makes a good table, 
so does a large log with one side hewed level. Each 
member of a party that I frequently camp with has a 
tin or wooden box in which fishing tackle, cartridges, 
s, etc., are carried. When dinner is prepared a 
e of spare canvas is laid upon the grass, the tin 
es and edibles are put upon this, then each m^ ' 



Camp Cooking Outfit. 49 

brings his box to the particular corner of the cloth he 
selects, sits on the grass, crosses his legs, and has each 
his individual table in his own private box, the cover 
of which is large enough to hold a tin plate, tin cup, 
knife and fork, etc. 

By all means wash the dishes immediately after each 
meal. You can smoke your post-prandial pipe and do 
this at the same time. Have a pot or kettle of water 
heating while you are eating, and if the frying pan 
is dirty, fill it with water and let it boil over the coals 
awhile. Put your dishes into the largest pail, pour hot 
water over them, tone it down with cold water so you 
can handle them, and wash the dishes, the least dirty 
first, with a sponge. Sapolio is good to scour them, 
but sand is better. Soap is less often used by male 
campers in dish-washing than it should be. It makes 
the work much easier. When washed, rinse the tin- 
ware in cold water, drain and dry with a towel. Wring 
out the sponge in clean water, and hang it on a bush 
ready for use again. 

Remove all refuse and leavings to a good distance 
from camp, and never allow the vicinity of the tent to 
become littered up with tomato cans, old cartridge 
shells, bones, feathers, corn-husks, etc. 



CHAPTER II. 

Soups. — General Remarks on Cooking Soups. — Soups made of 
Meat, Vegetables, Deer's Heads, Small Game, Rice, 
Fish and Turtle. 

SOUPS should be made in camp as often as the 
materials are at hand. They are wholesome and in- 
vigorating, and not difficult to prepare ; and so many 
different kinds can be made that no camper's appetite 
need be cloyed by lack of variety. Most canned soups 
are excellent, and the directions for cooking which 
come with them should be closely followed. 

The time given for cooking soups in the recipes 
that follow may seem unnecessarily long, but if it is 
done in a less time, it is at a loss in the flavor. Fast 
boiling drives off considerable of the aroma of the in" 
gredients used, the water evaporates fast and requires 
constant replenishing with boiling water, which con^* 
pels the cook to have an additional vessel always on 
the fire. Constant skimming is necessary, and an 
occasional slight stirring will prevent any of the 
vegetables from burning on the pot where but little 
water is used. 

Campers do not (iommonly have fresh meat in camp, 
unless in a portion of the country where venison, 



Soups, 5 1 

buffalo or bear meat form a part of the larder. With 
any one of these, or with betf, we can make what I 
will call 

Meat Soup. 

Use one pound of lean meat (cut into pieces the 
size of an ^g'^ to a quart of water. Put on the fire 
with the water cold, and let it heat gradually and 
simmer rather than boil, skimming it constantly and 
keeping the cover on the pot when this operation is 
not being performed. If any cooked meat or bones 
are to be added, this should be done after the soup 
has cooked three-quarters of an hour. From four and 
a half to five hours are necessary for the soup to cook. 
Just before it is done, season with salt and pepper. If 
made in an iron pot it should be transferred as soon 
as done to a tin or earthen vessel. In cold weather 
this soup may be kept fresh and sweet for a week 
and " warmed over " as long as it lasts. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Onions, potatoes, carrots, turnips, beets, parsnips, 
cabbage, cauliflower, pumpkins, squash, etc., should be 
picked over, washed, pared, and cut into small pieces 
from a quarter to a half-inch thick, put into a pan of 
cold water, rinsed and drained. Tomatoes should be 
scalded, peeled and sliced. Prepare a meat soup as 
above, and when it has cooked four hours put in all 
your vegetables except potatoes, which should be put 
in onlv about thirty minutes before the soup is done, 



52 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

Stir the soup occasionally to prevent the vegetables 
from scorching or sticking to the bottom of the pot, 
and skim frequently. When done take out the vege- 
tables, mash and return them to the soup, boil one 
minute, season and serve. Canned corn or tomatoes 
may be used in this soup the same as fresh vegetables. 

Deer's Head Soup. 

Skin the head and split it in pieces, remove the 
eyes and brains, and wash thoroughly in cold water. 
Then cook same as meat soup. 

Small G-ame Soup. 

Squirrels, rabbits, and small game generally can be 
cleaned and split and made into soup as above. When 
vegetables are added to soup made of small game, the 
latter should be removed and strained, and the good 
meat returned to the pot just before the vegetables 
are put in, leaving out all the bones, skin, gristle, etc. 

Bice Soup. 

Make a meat soup, with the addition of one sliced 
onion. Prepare the rice (one-half pound to a gallon 
of water) by picking it over, washing and draining, 
and stir it into the soup half an hour before it is done, 
stirring frequently to prevent burning. 

Bean Soup. 

Pick over two quarts of beans, wash, and soak them 
over night in cold water. Scrape clean one pound of 



Soups. 5^ 

salt pork, and cut into thin slices. Drain the beans, 
put them into six quarts of cold water, with one table- 
spoonful of soda, and let them boil gently for half an 
hour, skimming constantly. Then drain off all the 
water and put in the same amount of fresh boiling 
water. Boil slowly for an hour and a half, stirring 
frequently ; then put in the pork. When the beans 
have become tender enough to crack, take out the 
pork and mash the beans into a paste with a wooden 
masher or the bottom of a large bottle. Then put all 
back and boil slowly an hour longer. If no soda is 
used, longer boiling will be necessary. Bean soup 
will burn if not constantly stirred. Not much salt, 
but plenty of pepper should be used for seasoning. 

Pea Soup. 

Treat the peas exactly the same as the beans in the 
above recipe, except as to the preliminary boiling in 
water with soda. Make the same way as bean soup. 
Pea soup cools and thickens rapidly, therefore if 
squares of fried bread are thrown upon the surface 
before serving, it should be done quickly and while 
the bread is hot. Use more salt than with the bean 
soup for seasoning, and boil gently or it will surely 
burn. 

* Fish Soup. 

Cut up large fish, after it has been cooled from a 
previous cooking, into small pieces, and stew it with a 
piece of salt pork for two hours. 



54 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

Ttirtle Soup, 

Snapping turtles, " mud turtles " and all tortoises 
can be made into appetizing soup. Cut their throats 
to kill them and then let them bleed. Break the shell 
on the under side, cut out the meat, rejecting the 
entrails, head and claws, and boil slowly for three 
hours with some sliced onion. 



CHAPTER III. 

Fish.— Fish Baked, Plain and Stuffed. — Fish Gravy.— Fish 
Chowder. — Clam Chowder. — Orthodox Clam Chowder. 

''PHE subject of fish cookery belongs more to the 
1 canoeist than to the general camper, for the 
reason that the former is so constantly among them in 
their fluid home that he can readily catch a mess, and 
easily cook them with his small means after he has 
caught them. That is why nearly all the practical 
methods of cooking fish are given in Chapter III. of 
Part I. of this book. There are, however, some ways 
of preparing fish in camp that the canoeist will hardly 
attempt, for lack of time or utensils, and these methods 
will be given here. 

Plain Baked Fish. 

Dig a hole in the ground eighteen inches deep and 
large enough to contain the fish ; build a fire in it and 
let it burn to coals. Remove the coals, leaving the hot 
ashes in the bottom, on which place a thick layer of 
green grass. Put the fish on the grass, cover with 
another layer of grass ; then rake back the coals and 
loose earth and build a small fire on top. In an hour 
the baking will be complete, the skin will peel off and 



56 Canoe and Camp Cookery, 

leave the flesh clean. A fish prepared this way need 
not be scaled, but only disembowelled, as the scales 
will come off with the skin after it is cooked. 

Stiifibd Baked Fish. 

Only a large fish should be cooked in this manner, 
as it is hardly worth the trouble to stuff a small fish. 
Prepare a stuffing of bread or cracker crumbs, with 
enough butter or lard to make the mixture moist. 
Season with pepper and salt, and chop up with it 
one onion, and a little summer savory or sage, if 
desired. Clean and wipe the fish dry, put in the 
stuffing lightly and then sew up the opening. Lay 
the fish in the bake-kettle or Dutch oven, rub it all 
over with butter or lard and dredge it with flour, meal 
or some of the dry crumbs left over from the stuffing. 
Or, lay thin strips of fat salt pork or bacon on the top. 
Pour a little boiling water into the bottom to prevent 
the fish adhering, close the bake-kettle and put it into 
the fire among the hottest coals. In a very hot oven 
it should be done in forty minutes. Remove the 
bake-kettle several times before it is done to baste it. 
When cooked, serve with the following 

Fish Gravy. 

Put the bake-kettle back on the fire after the fish is 
removed ; stir into the gravy left, gradually, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour. Let it boil up once, season with 
pepper and salt, and pour over the fish. If there are 
squeamish people in camp remove the " black specks " 
from this gravy with a spoon. 



Fish. $7 

Fish Chowder.' 

Clean the fish and cut up all except the heads and 
tails into small pieces, leaving out as many bones as 
possible. Cover the bottom of the pot with slices of 
fat salt pork ; over that a layer of sliced raw pota- 
toes ; then a layer of chopped onions ; then a layer 
of fish ; on the fish a layer of crackers, first made 
tender by soaking in water or milk. Repeat the lay- 
ers, except pork, till the pot is nearly full. Every 
layer must be seasoned with pepper and salt. Put 
in enough cold water to moisten the whole mass 
well, cover the pot closely, set over a gentle fire, 
and let it simmer an hour or so. Cook it till it is 
rather thick, then stir it gently, and it is ready to 
serve. Tomatoes may be added as a layer after the 
onions. 

Clam Chowder 

Can be made the same as Fish Chowder, using 
clams instead of fish, but a large party of sea-beach 
picnickers will probably prefer the regular 

Orthodox Clam Chowder. 

The first thing necessary is an out-door oven made 
with flat stones. Start a rousing fire in this and let it 
burn until every stone is hot all the way through. 
Then rake out the coals beneath, even to the faintest 
cinder, so that there will be no smoky taste to the 
chowder. Then put a couple of stout boughs across 



58 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

the open top of the oven, and cover them with fresh 
seaweed an inch or two thick. Spread the shelled 
clams on the seaweed, over them a layer of onions, 
then a layer of sweet or Irish potatoes, or both, then 
green corn, then the fish (cleaned and salted and 
mapped in a cloth, and either a bluefish or a cod, if 
extra-orthodox), then a lobster, either alive or boiled. 
Now cover the whole arrangement with a large cloth, 
and pile on seaweed till no steam escapes. When it 
has cooked half an hour or so let the company attack 
it en massey uncovering it gradually as it is eaten, so as 
to retain the heat in it as long as possible. The 
stones should be extremely and thoroughly heated, or 
the chowder will be a failure, and the cinders should 
be cleaned out, the chowder put on, and the whole 
covered with great haste, so as not to give the stones 
a chance to cool.

^ Deer's Head. — Venison Sausages. — Stuffed Roasts op 
Game. — Woodchucks, Porcupines, 'Possums and Pigs. 

SOME good recipes for cooking meats and game, 
which are not given in Part I., are the following : 

Frizzled Beef. 

Cut dried beef into very thin shavings, and put into 
a frying pan nearly half full of cold water. Set over 
the fire and let it come to a boil, then stir in a large 
lump of butter and enough fiour to make a good 
gravy. 

Hash. 

Four pounds of cold boiled meat (not pork) or 
corned beef, free from bone or gristle, one large par- 
boiled onion, and two pounds of boiled or baked po- 
tatoes are chopped and mixed together, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and stirred up with about a pint of 
hot water. Put enough lard or butter into a frying 
pan to well cover the bottom when melted, and when 
it is " screeching hot," put in the hash. Stir it for a 
few minutes, then let it fry till it is brown on the 
bottom. Corned beef hash requires little salt for 
seasoning. 



6o Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

Boiled Pork. 

Soak over night in cold water and put into a pot of 
cold water over the fire when the boiling begins. 
Boil same as other meat (see page 27) and save the 
cake of fat that rises when it is cold for frying pur- 
poses. Turnips, cabbage, potatoes and greens are 
good boiled with the pork. See table for boiling vege- 
tables in the next chapter. 

Fork Hash. 

Cut salt pork or bacon into small dice, and while it 
is frying over a slow fire cut raw potatoes and onions 
into thin slices, put them with the pork, cover the fry- 
ing pan and cook for ten minutes, occasionally stir- 
ring. 

Fork and Beans. 

The right proportions are two quarts of beans to 
three pounds of pork. Pick over the beans at night, 
wash them, and put them to soak in cold water until 
the next morning. Then if only boiled pork and 
beans are desired, drain the beans, and put them with 
the pork in the pot, just cover with cold water, set 
over the fire (with the cover on the pot), and boil till 
the beans are tender^ skimming the scum off as it 
rises. If baked beans are wanted parboil the pork 
and cut it into thin slices, then drain the beans and 
boil as above. Put half the beans into the bake-kettle, 
then the pork, then the remainder of the beans, and 



Meats and Game. 6i 

pour over them half a pint of boiling water. Bake 
among the coals till the top is crusted brown. If 
buried in the ground with a good supply of coals it is 
best to put them in at night when going to bed, and 
they will be done in the morning. If the bake-kettle 
is enveloped in hot coals on the surface of the ground 
they will bake on the outside quicker, but inside, 
where the pork is, they will not be baked at all. This 
latter method, therefore, should only be used when in 
a hurry, and in this case the pork should be scattered 
around in different portions of the pot, and the beans 
left may be re-baked for another meal. 

G-ame Stew. 

Cut up any kind of game, whether furred or feath- 
ered, into small pieces, wash it, and put it in *a pot 
with some pork cut into pieces three inches square, 
and rather more than enough water to cover it all. 
Let it boil for half an hour, skimming off the particles 
that rise to the top. Then add four or five sliced 
onions, some parsley or summer savory, salt and pepper, 
and boil slowly for an hour and a half. Half an hour 
before it is done put in a few pared potatoes, cut to a 
uniform size. 

Brunswick Stew.* 

For a stew for five or six persons the following are 

* This is a favorite Virginia dish, of which the compiler of this 
book has eaten, but which he has never cooked. The recipe here 
given is said by an old Virginian to be reliable. 



62 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

the ingredients : two-good- sized or three small squir- 
rels, one quart of tomatoes, peeled and sliced, one 
pint of butter or lima beans, six potatoes, parboiled 
and sliced, six ears of green corn cut from the cob, 
one-half pound of butter, one-half a pound of fat salt 
pork, one teaspoonful of black pepper, one-half a tea- 
spoonful of cayenne, one gallon of water, one table- 
spoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of white sugar, 
one onion minced small. Cut the squirrels into joints, 
and lay in cold water to draw out the blood ; put on 
the gallon of water, with the salt in it, and let it boil 
for five minutes ; put in the onion, beans, corn, pork 
which has been cut into fine strips, potatoes, pepper 
and the squirrels ; cover closely, and stew two and 
a-half hours very slowly, stirring the mass frequently 
from the bottom to prevent its burning. Then add 
the tomatoes and sugar, and stew an hour longer. 
Ten minutes before it is to be taken from the fire, add 
the butter, cut into bits the size of a walnut, and rolled 
in flour ; give a final boil, taste to see that it is sea- 
soned to your liking, and serve at once. 

Flour Gravy. 

After stews have been taken from the pot stir a 
tablespoonful of flour gradually into a small quantity 
of cold water, carefully breaking all the lumps. Then 
pour this gradually into the boiling liquor left in the 
pot from the stew, let it boil well two minutes, and 
serve. If flour is sprinkled dry into boiling water it 
^ill form into lumps at pnce^ no njatt^r how much it is 



Meats and Game. 63 

stirred. A tablespoonful of flour will sufficiently 
thicken nearly a quart of liquor. If what is called 
** brown gravy " is desired, heat the flour first in a fry- 
ing pan, stirring it till it is brown. 



Boast Venison. 

The saddle is the best portion for roasting, and 
after this the shoulder. Hang it by a cord over a huge 
bed of coals, or use the crotched stakes, impaling the 
venison on the cross-piece. Insert thin slices of salt 
pork or bacon in gashes cut with a knife where the 
flesh is thick enough to admit of "gashing,'* or 
skewer them on with hard wood twigs where it is not. 
Turn frequently. The flesh on Ihe surface will 
become hard by the time the roast is done, but this 
can be avoided by covering it with buttered paper fas- 
tened on with wooden skewers. From two to three 
hours are required for roasting. 

Baked Deer's Head. 

^ Build a fire in a hole in the ground. When it has 
burned to a good bed of coals put in the deer's head, 
neck downward, with the skin on but the eyes and 
brains removed. Cover with green grass or leaves, 
coals and earth, and build a new fire on top of all. In 
about six hours exhume the head, remove the skin, and 
the baking is complete. This method of baking 
applies as well tq the head of any animal, 



^ 



64 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

Forequarter of Venison. 

This portion is always tough, but may be utilized by 
stewing it, or making it into 

Venison Sausages. 

Chop up pieces of the forequarter, mix with half as 
much chopped salt pork, season with pepper and salt, 
make into balls, and fry. 

Stuffed Shoulder of Venison. 

If you are very " swell " campers-out, and have 
some port or Madeira wine with you, you may stew 
the shoulder of venison in the following manner : 
Extract the bones through the under side and make a 
stuffing as follows : Chop up suet very fine, and mix 
it with bread crumbs, in the proportion of half a pint 
of suet to a quart of breadcrumbs. Moisten this with 
wine, season with pepper and allspice and fill the holes 
from which the bones were taken. Bind firmly in 
shape with strips of clean cloth, put in a large sauce- 
pan with part of a gravy made by boiling the trim- 
mings of the venison ; add to this a glass of port or 
Madeira wine and a little black pepper. Cover 
tightly and stew very slowly three or four hours, 
according to the size. It should be very tender when 
done. Remove the strips of cotton cloth with care, 
dish, and, when you have strained the gravy, pour it 
over the meat.

Meats and Game. 65 

Stuffed Gktme Boasted. 

Large birds (ducks or turkeys, etc.), rabbits, hares, 
woodchucks, porcupines, opossums, and the like, may 
be stuffed with a dressing made of salt pork and bread 
or crackers. Chop the pork very fine, soak the bread 
or crackers in hot water and mash them smooth, and 
mix them with the chopped pork. Season with pepper, 
a little salt, sage and chopped onion. Sew up the game 
after stuffing with wire in two or three places, and 
roast over hot coals. If wrapped in wet brown paper 
it may be immersed in hot ashes and baked, if small, 
or may be baked the same as fish. 

Woodchucks and Porcupines. 

When properly cooked, are little inferior to any game. 
They must be thoroughly parboiled before cooking, 
and then may be roasted or stewed. A young wood- 
chuck or porcupine may be baked in the ground with 
the hide on, after having been drawn, and is very pal- 
atable. 

Opossums and Young Figs 

Are roasted alike. After cleaning the opossum or 
pig stuff him with bread crumbs, chopped onion and 
sage or summer savory for seasoning, boiled Irish and 
sweet potatoes (the latter especially with the 'possum) 
and whole boiled onions being pushed in among the 
dressing. Wire up the opening in two or three places, 
fold the legs down on the body and wire them fast

ALL vegetables must be carefully looked over. Re- 
move the unripe or decayed parts, and then wash 
in cold water. When to be boiled they should be put 
in boiling salted water, and if necessary to replenish 
the water before the cooking is complete^ boiling water 
should be always used. Keep the vessel covered, and 
drain the vegetables as soon as done. Do not let the 
water boil long before the vegetables are put in. Old 
and strong vegetables sometimes require boiling in 
two or three waters.

boiling salt water to cover them. Stew gently till 
tender, stirring frequently ; then drain, add a cup of 
milk and a piece of butter the size of an tggy and stir 
till it boils up once. Season to taste.

BoUed Beets. 
Winter beets must be soaked over night in water. 
Wash them, but do ii<# scrape or cut them, as they 
lose in color and quality by being cut. Put them id 
boiling water enough to cover them well, cover and 
boil till tender, which will take from one to three 
hours. Then put them in cold water and rub off the 
skins quickly. If large, slice them ; if young, split 
lengthwise. 

Greens. 
When in camp or on a cruise, a most delicious dish 
can be made of boiled greens, of which a large variety 
of weeds and plants furnishes the material. Dande- 
lion leaves, nettles, milkweed, spinach, young beet 
tops, turnip tops, mustard, narrow dock, mountain 
cow-slip, kale, cabbage, poke, sprouts and other 
" weeds " are good. They should be picked over care- 
' lly, washed in three or four waters, and soaked in

Mushrooms* 

Edible mushrooms are found in clear, open, sunny 
fields and elevated ground where the air is pure and 
fresh ; poisonous ones are found in woods, low, damp 
ground, in shady places and upon putrefying sub- 
stances. The edible kind are most plentiful in August 
and September, and spring up after low lying fogs, 
soaking dews or heavy rains. They first appear very 
small and of a round form, on a little stalk, the upper 
part and stalk being then white. They grow very fast, 
and, as the size increases, the under part gradually 
opens and showsa fringyfur (called " gills ") of a deli- 
cate salmon color. After the mushroom is a day old 
this salmon color changes to a russet or dark brown. 
The gills of the poisonous variety are red, green, blue, 
yellow or orange red, and sometimes white, but they 
never have the delicate salmon color of the edible

stewed Mushrooms. 

Select mushrooms of uniform size. Wipe them clean 
with a soft cloth ; peel, commencing at the edge and 
finishing at the top ; cut off the lower part of the 
stem ; put them into a tin or earthen vessel and half 
cover them with cold water, and stew gently for fifteen 
minutes, frequently stirring to prevent burning ; sea- 
son with pepper and salt. When the stew is done stir 
into it one or more tablespoonfuls of butter, previously

mushroom. The latter have an agreeable odor, and 
the poisonous have sometimes a similar odor, but gen- 
erally smell fetid. The flesh of the edible kind is com- 
pact and brittle ; that of the poisonous generally soft 
and watery. The skin of the former is easily peeled 
from the edges, and the seeds or sprouts are for the 
most part roundish or oval ; the skin of the latter is i 

not easy to peel and the seeds are mostly angular. 
Some poisonous ones assume a bluish tint on being 
bruised and others exude an acrid, milky juice. The 
mushroom should have all of the above-named char- 
acteristics of the edible variety before it is put in the - i 
pot, and it is safest not to select mushrooms gathered \ 
by somebody else, as they change color after being \ 
picked several hours, and the two kinds are then diffi- 
cult to distinguish. Finally, if a white peeled onion 
cooked with then! turns black, or if a silver spoon with 
which they are stirred while cooking turns black, don't \ 
eat them ; and if you don't know a salmon color from \ 
a yellow let somebody gather them who does.

omitted the further portion of the recipe in practice, 
but gives it here for the benefit of those whose tastes 
may be more dainty than his own. 

Cracked Wheat. 

To one quart of the wheat add one tablespoonful 
of salt, and soak over night in cold water enough to 
cover it. In the morning put the wheat with the 
water it was soaked in into a pot, cover closely and 
cook gently until soft — probably from one to one and 
one-half hours — stirring frequently to prevent scorch- 
ing. When necessary to replenish the water add boil- 
ing water. 

Hominy Grits 

Are cooked the same as cracked wheat, and are very 
wholesome. Coarse hominy requires long boiling. 

Batter Cakes. 

Put one quart of sifted flour in a deep dish, and mix 
with it one-half teaspoonful of salt, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder and one teaspoonful of 
sugar. Add warm water (milk is better) sufficient to 
make a thick batter. Then add two eggs, beaten light, 
and • if they do not thin down the batter sufficiently, 
add more water (or milk). Beat thoroughly and cook 
immediately the same as slapjacks.

CHAPTER VII. 

Dishes for Yachtsmrm. — Macaroni, Boiled and Bakrd. — 
Baked Turkry. — Pie Crust. — Brown Betty. — Applb 
Pudding.— Apfle Dumplings. 

FOR the benefit of Corinthian yachtsmen, recipes are 
here given for some dishes which are rather too 
elaborate in preparation for camp purposes, but which 
can be cooked readily in the yacht's galley, if it be 
providedwith a regular yacht's stove, having an oven, 
etc. 

Boiled Haoarooi. 

Wipe the macaroni carefully, and break it into 
lengths, put it into a pot of boiling salt water, say ten 
times as much water as macaroni. Boil fifteen to 
twenty minutes, or until tender. Take care that it 
does not burst or become a pulp from excessive boil- 
ing ; drain at once and season with butter. 

If desired to impart the flavor of onion to maca- 
roni boil with it two onions for each pound of maca* 
roni. The liquor drained from the macaconi may be 
' used for broth or soup. 

Boiled macaroni may be served with a white sauce, 
made as follows : for one pound of macaroni put 



Dishes for Yachtsmen. 8 1 

* 

into a pot over the fire two ounces of butter and two 
ounces of flour, stir until it becomes smooth, then 
gradually stir in one quart of hot milk and water in 
equal parts, season with pepper and salt, put in the 
macaroni, and let it remain over the fire for one 
minute. 

Or, as soon as the butter and flour bubbles, gradu- 
ally pour in one quart of boiling water, stirring it 
until it becomes smooth ; season with pepper and salt ; 
put in the macaroni and let it remain over the fire for 
one minute. Have ready one or two onions, minced 
or shredded, fried brown. Dish he macaroni and 
pour the fried onions over it. 

Boiled macaroni may be served with tomato sauce 
made as follows : for one pound of macaroni put into 
a pot half a can of tomatoes, or twelve large fresh ones, 
one half a pint of stock, gravy, or broth of any kind, 
a little thyme or parsley, six whole cloves, a sliced 
onion, pepper and salt. Cover and boil gently for one 
hour, stirring frequently ; drain and press the mixture 
through a sieve (an old pan full of nail holes will do) ; 
then stir into it about two ounces of butter and one 
ounce of flour, previously mixed smooth over the fire ; 
stir until it is well incorporated ; pour it over the 
macaroni : sprinkle on top grated cheese, and put it 
into the oven for five or ten minutes. 

Baked Macaroni and Cheese. 

Boil and drain the macaroni and with it fill by layers 
a buttered earthen dish, seasoning each layer with 
butter, grated cheese, mustard, pepper, and salt ; add 



82 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

bread crumbs for the top layer. Cover and put it into 
the oven, and bake with a moderate heat for a half 
hour. Remove the cover, and when the top is 
browned serve in the baking-dish. 

Minced fat pork may be used instead of butter. 

Baked Turkey. * 

Tame and wild turkeys are prepared and cooked 
alike. The time for cooking is from fifteen to twenty 
minutes to the pound, but this depends much upon 
the age of the bird ; it must be well done to be palat- 
able. Success lies in cooking it long enough, and 
frequent basting. 

Put the turkey into a pan of cold water ; rinse it in- 
side and out in three or four waters ; in the last water 
but one dissolve a teaspoonful of soda. Fill the body 
with this water ; shake it well ; pour it off and rinse 
with fresh water ; wipe it dry inside and out ; rub the 
inside with pepper and salt. Prepare a stuffing as fol- 
lows ; Mix into enough grated bread crumbs to fill 
the craw and body of the turkey a half teaspoonful of 
summer savory, thyme, or sage, four ounces of lard, 
four ounces of butter, with enough warm water to 
make the mixture moist. 

Mix all thoroughly and stuff the craw and body with 
it ; tie a string tightly about the neck ; sew up the 
incision ; tie down the wings and legs ; then lay it on 
its back in the baking-pan ; wet the skin and season 
it with pepper and salt and dredge it with flour. Dis- 
tribute on the upper side small pieces of butter ; put 



i 



Dishes for Yachtsmen. 83 

into the pan about a pint of boiling stock or a quarter 
of a pound of butter ; have a brisk fire ; put the pan 
into the oven and bake. Baste frequently, at least 
every ten minutes ; bake to a rich brown. If it browns 
too rapidly lay a sheet of white paper over it until the 
lower part is done. When the turkey is browned on 
the breast turn it over in the pan while in the oven. 

Pepper, salt, and dredge the back with flour, and 
bake until browned, basting as above. When baked 
remove the strings from the neck and body y put it 
into a hot dish and serve with a flour gravy, made as 
described on page 62. 

The turkey may also be stuffed with sausage-meat, 
fresh oysters or roasted chestnuts. 

Fie Crust. 

All pie crust should be made in a cool place and 
handled as little as possible during the process. The 
heat from the hand makes the crust tough. The in- 
gredients are : 

One quart of flour (sifted) ; one-fourth of a pound 
butter ; one-half teaspoonful salt ; enough cold water 
to make a stiff dough. Sift the flour into a deep 
wooden bowl or tin pan ; put into it the salt ; mix ; 
then the lard. With a keen chopping-knif e cut up the 
lard into the flour until it is thoroughly incorporated, 
with no lumps ; wet with cold water, stirring it in with 
a wooden spoon until it becomes a stiff dough. Flour 
the hands and make dough into a lump with as little 
handling as possible. 

Remove lump to well-floured kneading-board, and 



84 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

roll it out into a sheet a fourth of an inch thick, al- 
ways rolling from you, and with as little pressure upon 
the rolling-pin as may be necessary. 

Into the rolled sheet stick small pieces of butter at 
regular intervals. Dredge slightly with flour. Roll 
up the sheet, commencing to roll from the side nearest 
you. Roll out, again buttering and dredging until the 
butter is exhausted. If time will permit, when the 
butter has been exhausted and the roll made up, lay 
it away in a cold place or on the ice for twenty 
minutes. 

Place it again upon the floured kneading-board, roll 
out into a sheet as hereinbefore directed. Butter the 
pie-plates ; lay the paste lightly within them, fitting 
it nicely. Trim off the paste neatly around the edges 
of the pie-plates. Gather up the cuttings and roll 
them into a separate sheet. 

If the pies are to have a top crust, cover the tops 
with the paste, cutting neatly round the edges, and 
with a knife, spoon or the fingers join securely the 
edges of the top and sides to prevent escape of juices. 
Then with a sharp knife make three or four incisions 
about an inch long in the center of the top crust. 

If the top crust is lightly brushed with sweet milk 
it will brown evenly. 

Bake in a moderate oven until a light brown. Be 
careful to have the heat as great at the bottom as at 
the top of oyen. If this is not looked to, the lower 
crust will be uncooked and inedible. 

Should a richer crust be desired the proportions of 
lard and butter can be doubled. 



Dishes for Yachtsmen. 85 

Brown Betty (Baked). 

The ingredients are : Cooking-apples, pared, cored, 
and sliced ; dry-bread crumbs, or well-toasted bread 
rolled into crumbs ; sugar, butter, and ground cinna- 
mon. 

Grease well a deep baking-dish. Into the bottom 
of this put a layer of prepared apples ; sprinkle them 
lightly with sugar ; scatter small pieces of butter over 
this, then dust with ground cinnamon ; over this place 
a layer of bread crumbs from one-half to three-quarters 
of an inch thick ; over this apples, butter, and cinna- 
mon, and continue this process until the dish is full, or 
until sufficient material has been used. The top layer 
must be crumbs, and on this must be scattered small 
pieces of butter. If the top layer is moistened with a 
couple of tablespoonfuls of milk it will brown more 
evenly. 

Put into a moderate oven and bake from a half to 
three-quarters of an hour. 

When a fork will easily penetrate the apples it is 
cooked. Alden dried apples may be substituted for 
the fresh fruit. 

It can be eaten hot or cold with butter, sugar, or 
sauce. 

Baked Apple Pudding. 

Use the following ingredients : Apples pared, cored 
and sliced ; one quart sifted flour ; three teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder, incorporated with the dry flour ; 
one-half teaspoonful salt ; two tablespoonfuls lard 



86 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

(half butter is preferable) ; one pint milk (cold water 
will do). 

Have ready sugar, butter, and ground cinnamon. 
Put flour into a deep dish or pan ; mix into it the salt 
and lard ; then add the milk, and work the mixture 
with the hands to a smooth light dough. 

Roll the dough into a sheet about one-quarter of an 
inch thick. Have prepared a well-greased baking- 
dish. Cover the bottom and sides of the dish with 
rolled dough or paste, press it lightly against the 
sides and bottom, and cut off the edges above the dish. 

Put into the bottom of the baking-dish thus pre- 
pared a thick layer of sliced apples, sprinkle them 
with sugar and ground cinnamon, then another layer 
of apples treated in like manner, and so on succes- 
sively until the dish is full. The top layer of apples 
should have the dressing of sugar and cinnamon, and 
be also sprinkled with small pieces of butter. Wet 
the top layer with three or four teaspoonfuls of water, 
and then sprinkle it lightly with dry flour. 

Take the remainder of the dough, roll it out thin, 
and cover the dish with it, pressing the paste down 
round the edges of the dish to join it with the paste 
that lines the sides. Make three or four incisions in 
the cover with a sharp knife. 

Then put the dish into a moderate oven and bake 
from one to one and a half hours. When a fork 
easily penetrates the pudding, it is cooked. Eat hot 
with sauce. Alden dried apples, canned apples, 
canned peaches, or fresh peaches pared, quartered, 
and the ston^ extracted may be used^ 



Dishes for Yachtsmen. 87 

Baked Apple Dumplings. 

The apples pared, cored and quartered. Prepare 
paste as directed for Baked Apple Pudding above. 

When the paste is rolled, cut it into squares, and in 
the centre of each square place the four parts of an 
apple ; add to each apple a piece of butter the size of 
a chestnut and a small sprinkle of sugar and ground 
cinnamon. 

Envelop the apple in the paste, pressing the cut 
edges together. Place the Sumplings thus prepared 
into a well-greased baking-pan, cut edges downwards. 

Bake a half to three-fourths of an hour in a mod- 
erate oven. When a fork will penetrate the dumplings 
they are cooked. Apples dried by the Ald«n process 
may be used.

HINTS. 

Cooking in Iron Pots. — Let nothing stand in an 
iron pot after it is cooked, or it will become discolored 
and have an unpleasant <aste. 

Rusty Knives. — If knives become rusty, rub them 
with a fresh-cut potato dipped in ashes. 

Emetic. — Gunpowder dissolved in water is a good 
emetic. 

Save the Bacon Grease. — After frying salt pork, 
bacon or fat meat, do not discard the grease that is 
left in the pan. Keep a cup or small tin pail, in 
which pour all residue. It will soon harden, and is 
just the thing for frying slapjacks or potatoes in. 

Improved River Water for Drinking. — If you 
make tea do not throw out the " grounds " after each 
drawing. In warm weather ordinary lake or river 
water will taste very refreshing if poured into the pot 
where tea-grounds have been left, and allowed to 
stand a few minutes before drinking. 

Salt. — It is always best in cooking to use too little' 
salt rather than too much. Further salting can be 
easily done at any time, but it is difficult or impossible 
to freshen anything that has been over-salted. 



Hints, 89 

Baking Powder. — In using baking powder it is 
always best to follow the printed directions on the 
can as to the amount. The different makes of bak- 
ing powders have each a different strength. 

Spoons. — On a canoe trip, where storage room is at 
a premium, one spoon will suffice for all purposes. 
Let it be of iron, of " dessert " size. Get a tinsmith 
to cut off two inches of the handle, and solder 
strongly to the stump a tin cylinder one-half inch 
in diameter. There will be no long handle to interfere 
with packing it in a small space, and if a long handle 
is desired for skimming soups, stirring mush, etc., a 
stick of any length can be instantly cut to fit the tin 
cylinder. 

Frozen Fish should be soaked in cold water to 
thaw them before cooking. 

Fish-eating Ducks may be made palatable by 
parboiling them in water with an onion in it. After 
parboiling them throw away the onion and lay the 
ducks in cold water for half an hour, after which they 
may be roasted, broiled, fried or stewed. 

Soft vs. Hard Water. — Beans, peas and other 
vegetables are best boiled in soft water. Hard 
water can be made soft (if its hardness depends upon 
the presence of carbonate of lime) by boiling it an 
hour and then allowing it to cool, when most of the 
lime will be precipitated. 

Broiling. — Remember that it is better to broil 
before a fire than over it, as by the former process the 



$6 Canoe and Camp Cookery. 

juices of the meat can be caught and used as a dress- 
ing, while in the latter manner they are lost in the fire 
and tend to give a smoky flavor by their ignition. Jn 
broiling, the article should be turned frequently. 

Frying. — The lard or fat used for frying should 
always be very hot before the article to be cooked is 
put in. If little jets of smoke issue from the top of 
the fat it is hot enough. If the fat is insufficiently 
hot, anjrthing cooked in it will taste of the grease, 
while the moment a substance is dropped into fat at a 
great heat the exterior pores are closed, and no grease 
penetrates it. 

Mixing Ingredients. — Preciseness in the prepara- 
tion of ingredients is an important element of success 
in cooking. Guessing at proportions is the practice 
of the lazy or indifferent cook. 

New Iron Pots. — Boil a handful of grass in a 
new iron pot, then scrub it inside with soap and sand, 
fill it with clean water and let this boil half an hour. 
It is then ready to use for cooking. 

Table of Approximate Weights and Meas- 
ures. — The following table may be of use. It is near 
enough to accuracy for cooking purposes : — 

Three teaspoonfuls = One tablespoonful. 
Four tablespoonfuls = One wine glass. 
Two wine glasses = One gill. 
Two gills = One tumbler or cup. 
Two cupfuls = One pint. 



Hints. $! 

One quart sifted flour = One pound. 

One quart powdered sugar = One pound, seven 
ounces. 

One quart granulated sugar = One pound, nine 
ounces. 

One pint closely packed butter = One pound. 

Three cupfuls sugar = One pound. 

Five cupfuls sifted flour. = One pound. 
■ One tablespoonful salt = One ounce. 

Seven tablespoonfuls granulated sugar = One half 
pint. 

Twelve tablespoonfuls flour = One pint. 

Three coffee cupfuls = One quart. 

Ten eggs = One pound. 

Yeast. — A serviceable yeast for leavening bread 
may be made by mixing flour and cold water into a 
thin batter. Set it away in a bottle until it sours, 
when it is ready for use.
