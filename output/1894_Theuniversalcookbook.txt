Housekeepers, do you want the best bread obtainable? 

If so, use, ''CERES " Flour in your bread making and 
you will have bread that will be the envy of your neighbors, 
Everybody who has used " CERES " Flour says that it makes 
"more" bread, "lighter" bread, "sweeter" bread, "whiter'' 
bread and "better " bread than any other flour. Tell your 
grocer that you will have " CERES " Flour and that you'll 
accept no substitute. We will tell you a way so you can be 
positive that you are getting the genuine "CERES." L,ook 
for the circular signed in autograph by Win. M. Gait & Co.,

INTRODUCTORY. 

Ladies : 

The Universal Cook Book is before you. 
While it does not aspire to a place among kindred books 
by noteworthy authors, the Compiler feels moved to say 
that she trusts that its carefully selected recipes of proven 
merit may entitle it to "honorable mention" in the 
kitchen. 

That she is able to place this book in your 
hands, is due to the substantial support and encourage- 
ment which she has received from the members of the 
Ladies' Aid of the Church of Our Father, to whom this 
book is respectfully dedicated.

SOUPS 



li Nozu good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both." 

Shakespeare. 

Soups can be made from fresh fish, flesh or fowl, vegetables, 
water or milk, aud from odds and ends of all. Have always on 
hand whole and ground spices, sweet herbs, celery -seed, parsley, 
onions, carrots and turnips ; rice, barley, tapioca, corn starch 
and flour ; thicken and enrich. 

In seasoning soup, for every quart of water use a teaspoonful of 
salt, one-eighth as much black pepper, two or three pepper-corns, 
a pinch of celery-seed, a teaspoonful of mixed herbs, loose tea- 
spoonful of parsley, half a pint of mixed vegetables. Vegetables, 
if not cooked before, go in with the meat. First fry the vegetables 
in a little butter ; it gives a " tasty " flavor. 

In making stock, use a quart of water for every pound of meat 
and bone. Cut the meat in pieces, crack the bcnes, place all 
in the kettle, pour over it the proper quantit}' of cold water ; let 
it soak awhile on the back of the range before cooking. Let soup 
boil slowly, never hard. Some tart apple is good in soup. When 
all is thoroughly done, strain through a sieve or coarse cloth ; do 
not squeeze the cloth. If too thick, thin before using. Soup 
stock can be kept several days in cold weather. Put the vege- 
tables in the day you use it ; it keeps better without them. Never 
let the fat remain on your soup. Let it get cold and lift it off; or 
skim it off if hot. 

Soup stock can be made clear by adding, when cold, the white 



2 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

and shell of one egg for each quart of stock. Set it on the fire 
and stir till hot, let simmer ten minutes, then add a cup of cold 
water and strain through a fine strainer or napkin. Serve with 
lemon shaved thin, croutons, force-meat balls, or hard yolk of 

egg- 
In thickening soups, use corn -starch or flour rubbed with but- 
ter. Add catsup or sauces just before using. 

The fine delicate flavor of many soups you have eaten was pro- 
duced entirely by a delicious combination of seasonings. Bou- 
quets of herbs for flavoring soups are made by tying a small bay 
leaf, a blade of mace, a sprig of any dry sweet herb (except sage) 
and a dozen pepper corns in the midst of a little bunch of pars- 
ley leaves and winding with twine, or enclosing it in a tarletan 
bag. 

Asparagus Soup. 

Take a knuckle of veal, cut in small pieces. Boil 2 hours with 
a small piece of salt pork. Take 2 or 3 bunches of asparagus cut 
up in small pieces, and put all but the heads in the soup ; boil 1 
hour longer, then strain ; return to the fire and add the heads, 
boil until they are tender, season with pepper, serve in the tureen 
with toast. 

Beef Soup. 

Boil soup bone day before wanting it ; skim grease off next 
day, and melt jelly ; add spices to taste, little brandy, small tea- 
cupful of butter rubbed in browned flour, little vermicelli, and 
grated carrot. Boil 3 eggs hard, mash smooth, put in tureen, and 
pour soup over them. 

Bouillon. 

Six pounds of beef and bone. Cut up the meat and break the 
bones ; add 2 quarts of cold water and simmer slowly 5 hours. 
Strain through a fine sieve, removing every particle of fat. Sea- 
son only with pepper and salt.

kettle ; beat the white of egg with a half-cupful of cold water, 
add it to the boiling consomme, boil one minute and strain through 
cheese-cloth. Season, and it is ready to serve.

pint cream.

parsley when the chicken is about half done. Remove the] 
chicken when thoroughly cooked — which may be served as boiled 
chicken or used for chicken salad. Add the noodles, boil fifteen

FISH AND SHELL FISH. 

- ''Master, I marvel how the fishes live in the Sea /" 
" Why, as men do on land ; the §;reat ones eat up the little ones." 

Pericles. 

How to select Fish. 

Iu selecting fish at the market see that the gills are red, the 
eyes full, the body of the fish firm, and the fins stiff. 

vSalt mackerel and other small salt fish should be broiled. 
Small pan fish and steaks of large white dry fish are good fried. 
Fresh salmon, mackerel, and blue fish are oily fish and should, 
not be fried. , Boil oily fish if large — broil them if small. Cod, 
haddock, blue fish, small salmon, bass, and shad may be stuffed 
and baked whole. 

Serve fish with bread and potatoes, and cucumbers, if in sea- 
son. 

Cream and egg sauces, lobster, oyster, shrimp, tartar and piq- 
uante sauces are served with boiled fish. 

Fry fish and oysters in very hot salt pork fat. Oil is better but 
very expensive. 

Fish may be scaled much easier by dipping into boiling water 
about one minute. 

Oysters are best roasted in the shell, convex side downward to 
hold the juices, and cooked till they will open well. 

Baked Shad. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 
Make a dressing of bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls of minced 



i 4 THE UNIVERSAL COOK BOOK. 

onion, some chopped parsley, a little butter, i teaspoonful of 
chopped suet, pepper and salt, sage and a beaten egg. Wet with 
milk. Stuff the fish and sew or tie securely. PI ace in a pan with 
some hot water ; lay pieces of salt pork on top with a little pepper 
and salt, and bake, basting very often. 

Fried Blue Fish and other kinds. 

Clean, wipe dry, inside and out. Sprinkle with flour, and sea- 
son with salt. Fry in hot butter or sweet lard, l / 2 lard and y z 
butter make a good mixture for frying fish. The moment fish 
are done to good brown, take them from fat and drain in hot 
strainer ; garnish with parsley. 

To Fry Brook Trout or Any Other Small Fish. 

Clean fish, and let them lie a few minutes wrapped singly in 
clean dry towel ; season with pepper and salt ; roll in corn meal, 
fry in % butter and % lard ; drain on sieve, and serve hot. 

Broiled Halibut. 

Slices of halibut, salt, pepper, butter. Cut the slices offish 
about an inck thick, season with pepper and salt, and lay them 
in melted butter l / 2 hour, allowing 3 tablespoon fuls of butter to a 
pound of fish, then roll them in flour, and broil about 20 min- 
utes. Serve very hot. 

Boiled Fish. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 
Sew the fish in thin cloth fitted to shape, boil in salted water 
(boiling from the first) allow 15 minutes to the pound. Unwrap 
and pour over it the following sauce. 

Sauce For Boiled Fish. 

To 1 gill boiling water add as much milk ; stir into this while 
boiling 2 tablespoonfuls butter gradually, 1 tablespoonful flour 
wet up with cold water; as it thickens, the chopped yelk of 1 boiled 
egg and 1 raw egg beaten light. Take directly from fire, season 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 15 

with pepper, salt, a little chopped parsley and juice of 1 lemon, 
and set covered in boiling water (but not over fire) 5 minutes, 
stirring occasionally. Pour part of sauce over fish when dished ; 
the rest in a boat. Serve mashed potatoes with it. 

Fish Cutlets. 

Use a pint of cold broiled fish ; this should be mixed with a 
cream sauce and the yolks of 2 eggs ; when this mixture is quite 
cold it can readily be made iuto croquettes. These should be 
dipped into the beaten white of an egg, to which has been added 
just a little water; then cover them with bread crumbs ; never 
use fine crumbs for frying : the coarse crumbs act as a sponge in 
absorbing the fat, and thus leave the croquettes perfectly dry, 
as they should be ; you would be surprised to know how little 
fat is required for frying ; it requires only a few moments to 
brown the cutlets in the fat. 

Cream Fish. 

Three pounds haddock, 1 pint of cream, l / z pound of butter, 1 
tablespoonful of flour. Boil your fish with plenty of salt in the 
water. When cooked, skin it and takeout all the bones. Flake 
with a fork. Heat the cream, season it, and put y 2 large onion 
in it. Beat your butter and flour to a cream, and add the mix- 
ture, boiling fifteen minutes. Butter a large baking dish, put in 
a layer of fish and one of dressing, making sure to have the 
dressing on top. Cover with bread crumbs, putting small pieces 
of butter on top and brown nicely. Milk will do as well as cream 
if it is rich. 

* Mayonaise Fish. 

Take a pound or so of cold boiled fish (halibut or cod), cut into 
small pieces ; then make the dressing as follows : the yolks of 
2 boiled and 2 raw eggs rubbed to a smooth paste with salad oil; 
add to these, salt, pepper, a very little mustard, 2 teaspoonfuls 
of white sugar, and lastly 6 tablespoonfuls of vinegar ; beat the 



16 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

mixture until light, and just before pouring it over the fish stir 
in lightly the frothed white of a raw Qgg. Serve the fish in a dish 
with lettuce leaves around the edges ; half of the sauce mixed 
with the fish, the rest thrown over the top . 

Cod Fish Stew. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Cut up into inch pieces, allowing }4 teacupful to a pint of milk. 
Put on the stove in a stew pan or spider, well covered with cold 
water. When it comes to a boil, diain and pour in a pint or 
quart of milk, according to size of family. When hot, thicken 
with a tablespoonful of flour made smooth with cold milk or 
water. An egg broken in and stirred rapidly at the last is an im- 
provement. Season with a teaspoon ful of butter. Serve with 
baked potatoes. 

Codfish Balls. 

(Mrs. H. S. B.) 

A pound of firm white salt codfish, 6 medium-sized potatoes, % 
a teacup of milk, i egg, a full tablespoonful of butter. Put the 
fish in cold water and let it steep twenty minutes on the fire. 
Drain off the water, and pour on boiling water, letting it steep 
until it is sufficiently freshened. When cold, pick the fish into 
fine shreds with a fork, removing the skin and bones. Mash 
the potatoes, which must be fresh boiled, with the butter, add the 
milk and beaten egg and a little pepper, lastly the picked fish. 
Drop the mixture from a spoon into boiling lard. Never use 
flour in making up the balls. 

Fish Chowder. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

Five pounds of fish cut in steaks, i chopped onion, 4 
chopped potatoes, }& pound of salt pork, chopped. Put the pork 
and onions in the bottom of the kettle, let them fry brown, then

gill sherry or Madeira wine ; % teaspoonful mace ; salt and cay- 
enne to taste. 

Put the terrapins alive in boiling water and boil 10 or 15 min- 
utes, or until you can pull off the outer skin and the toe nails; 
put them back in fresh boiling water ; add a heaping teaspoon- 
ful of salt and boil slowly until the shells part easily and the 
flesh on the legs is quite tender. When done, take out, remove 
the under shell and let stand until cool enough to handle. Then 
take thick, heavy part of the intestines, and the gall sacks, which 
are found imbedded in one lobe of the liver, and throw them 
away. In removing the gall sack, be careful not to break it, as 
it would spoil the whole terrapin. Break the terrapin in con- 
venient si^ed pieces ; cut the small intestines into tiny pieces and 
add to the meat ; now add the liver broken up, also all eggs 
found in the terrapins. Now put into a stewing-pan with the 
juice it has given out while being cut. Roll the butter in flour, 
add it to the terrapin and stand in a very moderate fire until 
heated. Boil the 6 eggs for 15 minutes ; take out yolks ; mash to 
a soomth paste with 2 tablespoonfuls of the wine, then add this, 
the cream and seasoning to the terrapin ; let it boil up once ; 
take from fire, add wine and serve. It must never be boiled 
after adding wine. Add more or less wine to taste.

MEATS 



4 ' And now we ask what nob/e meat and drink, 
Can help to make man work, to make him think. ' ' 

When cutting meat to cook, always cut across the grain of the 
muscle. 

Never wash fresh meat before roasting ; scrape it, if necessary 
to clean it. If it has been wet or moist, wipe it thoroughly dry 
before cooking. 

Never put meat directly on the ice ; put it in a vessel on ice. 

If you baste roast meat, do not use salt in the basting. 

Salt and season boiling meats while cooking. 

In boiling, put fresh meats in hot water, and salt meats in cold 
water ; boil both slowly. 

Never salt and pepper boiling meats while cooking. Season 
with salt, pepper, and butter after removing from the gridiron. 

An^ordinary pan is good for boiling ; heat very hot ; use no 
fat of any kind ; put the meat flat on the pan, turn rapidly and 
often, and you will find a " pan broil " very good ; season when 
done. 

A pod of red pepper in the water will prevent the unpleasant 
odor of boiling from filling the house. The garnishes for meats 
are parsley, slices of lemon, sliced carrot, sliced beets and cur- 
rent jelly. 

Time-table for Meats. 

Aquarter of lamb will roast in an hour. 



30 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

A loin of veal will take two or three hours. 
A loin of mutton will roast in two hours. 

A leg of mutton requires from two to three hours, according to 
size. 

A small turkey will boil in one and a quarter hours ; medium 
in two hours ; large in two and a half or three hours. 

A beef tongue should be soaked for several hours, put in cold 
water and boiled slowly four or five hours. 

A large ham should boil four hours, a small one two hours, and 
be put on in cold water. 

Corned beef or pickled pork requires to be boiled longer than 
smoked meat. It should be cooked until the bones come out 
easily. To tender salt meats, add a little vinegar to the boiling 
water. 

Roast beef requires 15 minutes to the pound. 

How to Roast Beef. 

If the housekeeper, who asks how she can have her roast beef 
brown on the outside and rare and juicy within, will put her beef 
in a very hot oven at first, keeping the temperature as high as 
three hundred and fifty degrees or more for half an hour, then 
reducing the heat to about two hundred and fifty degrees for the 
remainder of the time of cooking, she will attain the desired re- 
sult. Of course the meat must be basted as often as every fifteen 
minutes. The great heat at first hardens as well as browns the 
surface of the piece of meat. This keeps in the juices. But if 
the high temperature be continued, the hardening process goes 
beyond the surface, and the result will be a hard, dry and 
stringy piece of meat. Salt when done. 

Roast Beef. 

Rib roast is best. Have butcher saw off about % bone. Cut 
ends of ribs clear of meat ; fold flap neatly around to thick part 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 31 

and secure with skewers. The trimmings are yours. As meat 
is weighed first, take it all — will make good material for soup or 
gravy. Put beef in dripping pan ; pour little boiling water over 
it. Rub a little salt into fat parts ; roast 10 minutes for every 
pound. If meat has much fat on top cover fatty portion with 
paste made of flour and water. When nearly done remove this, 
dredge beef with flour, baste well with gravy. Sprinkle salt 
over top and serve. Pour fat from gravy, return to fire, thicken 
with browned gravy, season and boil up once. A roast should 
always be served with the following : 

English Yorkshire Pudding. 

One half pound of flour, 1 pint of milk, a pinch of salt, 1 tea- 
spoonful of Baking Powder. Mix well together the baking pow- 
der, flour and salt, then add one-half the milk, and beat until 
perfectly smooth ; then add remainder of the milk. Melt some 
butter or dripping in a flat tin, pour in the batter, place a joint 
of beef or mutton on it, and bake in a quick oven. 

Pot Roast. 

(Mrs. C. W. F). 

Take any piece of fresh beef, lay in a flat-bottomed pot with 2 
good-sized onions ; cover with boiling water even with top of 
meat ; cover the pot tightly, and let stew slowly until the water 
is evaporated ; then turn the meat once or twice, watching, when 
it begins to brown, that it does not burn. Season with salt, pep- 
per, etc., to taste. 

Pot Roast. 

Take a lean piece of beef. Cut a little fat from it and fry in 
an iron pot a few minutes. Season the beef, and sprinkle over a 
little flour ; put in the pot and fry brown on all sides. Pour in 
hot water to half cover the beef, cover tightly and cook until 
tender. Add a little boiling water at intervals to prevent burn- 



32 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

ing. Thicken the gravy, and pour around the meat on the 
platter. 

Beef Stew with Dumplings. 

Two pounds lean beef, cut into inch squares, sprinkled with 
salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoon fuls of flour. Cut fat from meat 
into small bits, put in stew pan and fry ten minutes. Cut 1 on- 
ion, 2 slices carrot, 2 small turnips in small dice and fry in hot 
fat for ten minutes. Put in the meat and fry till it browns, stir- 
ring to prevent burning, then pour over one large quart hot 
water, and set on stove where it will simmer gently two and one- 
half hours. Then add 2 sliced potatoes, boil ten minutes, then 
put in dumplings and boil hard ten minutes without lifting the 
cover. 

Dumplings 1 pint flour, 2 teaspooni'uls of Baking Powder, 
l / 2 teaspoouful salt, % cup sugar. Mix thoroughly, and wet with 
1 small cup milk. Roll one-half inch thick, cut with biscuit cut- 
ter. Veal or mutton stew can be made the same as beef. 

Stewed Beef. 

Take the desired quantity of round beef, cut into three ounce 
pieces, and dredge with flour. Fry in the stew pan some beef 
drippings and a sliced onion. Put in the meat, and fry well stir- 
ring constantly ten minutes. Then add gradually enough water 
to cover the meat, season with salt, pepper, a teaspoouful each 
allspice, cloves and mace, a bay leaf, and a sliced lemon. L,et it 
simmer gently four hours. 

Beef's Tongue Boiled. 

(Marion Harland. ) 

Wash a large, perfectly fresh tongue in three waters. Then 
cover well with boiling water ; a little salt— plenty of it— and 
cook about twelve minutes to the pound. Strip off the skin ; 
dish, when you have trimmed away the root, pour over it the fol- 
lowing sauce : Strain a cup of the liquor in which the tongue

was boiled ; set cr^er the fire, arid stir iii 2 tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter cut up in flour, pepper to taste ; the juice of a lemon, and! 
when this has thickened, 2 small pickled cucumbers, chopped. 
This is a dish whose merits deserve to be better known. 

Braised Beef. 

(Miss Parloa.) 

Take six or eight pounds of the round, and lard with )i of a, 
pound of salt pork. Put 6 slices of pork in the bottom of the( 
braising pan, and as soon as it begins to fry add 2 onions, m 
small carrot, and y 2 small turnip, all cut fine. Cook these untili 
they begin to brown ; then draw them to one side of the pan anc 
put in the beef which has been well dredged with salt, pepper 
and flour. Brown on all sides, and then add 1 quart of boiling 
water and a bouquet of sweet herbs ; cover and cook slowly ii 
the oven for four hours, basting every twenty minutes. Take 
up, and finish the gravy as for braised tongue, or, add to tho 
gravy l / 2 can tomatoes and cook for ten minutes. Strain, pouj 
around the beef and serve. 

To Lard. 

(Miss Parloa.) 

Larding is a simple operation. The pork should be firm am 
young (salt of course). Cut thin, even slices parallel with thl 
rind, and cut these in long, narrow strips that will fit into thl 
needle. For beef, veal, turkey or chicken the strips should b 1 
about as large round as a lead pencil, and about three and on 
half inches long ; and for birds, chops and sweet breads the 
should be about as large round as a match. Three slices are a 
that can be cut from one piece of pork, because when you g 
more than an inch away from the rind the pork is so tender th; 
it will break when in the needle. Put the strips in a bowl 
broken ice to harden. Have the meat free from skin andgristl 
if beef or veal. Put a strip, also called a lardoon, into the need 
as far as it will 20. Push the needle through the meat, leavir 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 35 

about three-quarters of au inch of the strip exposed at both sides . 
Continue until there are a number of rows on the top of the meat. 

Spiced Beef. 

(Auntie Gregory.) 

Chop tough beefsteak (raw) and piece of suet size of an egg 
Season with pepper, salt, and a little summer savory. Add 2 
e gg s > % pt« bread crumbs, 4 or 5 tablespoons cream and a small 
piece of butter. Mix and work in roll, with enough flour to keep 
together, and bake in a pan (with a little butter and water) like 
a roast. Slice when cold. 

Potted Beef. 

The beef well boiled, all the fat taken off, chop very fine, sea- 
son with salt, pepper, allspice and a little sage. Melt butter 
enough to knead it well together. Pack it closely in bowls and 
pour melted butter over it. It will keep a week in cool weather. 

Broiled Beef Steak. 

Cut the steak about an inch in thickness if you like it rare, and 
broil it over a quick fire until it is browned on both sides. It 
should be turned often while broiling to prevent burning and to 
save the juice. Use a wire grating. Grooved gridirons recom- 
mended to save the gravy, should never be used ; for the gravy 
or juice of the meat should not be allowed to escape the meat 
until after it is dished. Season with salt and pepper after it is 
lone, and lay your butter cold on the steak, set it in the oven a 
minute or two until it is melted: 

Beef Steak and Potatoes. 

(Mrs. Fuller.) 

Take a large and tender steak, bone it, and scatter over it bits 
pf butter, salt and pepper and a little sage and finel}' chopped 
[ anions. Over that spread a thick cushion of mashed potatoes, 
a vell seasoned with salt, fresh butter and a very little milk. Roll 



36 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

up the steak with the potatoes inside, and fasten the sides an 
the ends with skewers. Put the steak into a baking pan with 
large cupful of stock of gravy and let it cook slowly, basting like 
a chicken. Serve with a rim of mashed potatoes around the 
platter and garnish with watercress. 

Beef Steak, with Onions. 



(Mrs. Parker.) 

Pound the steak, season and fry ; then dredge flour over it and 
add a cup of boiling water. Drain the onions, which must have: 
been boiled, cut them up and put them into the pan, having taken i 
out the steak ; add a lump of butter and a little more flour, stir, i 
and when the onions are brown, put in the steak ; whemj 
thorougly heated, serve. 

Beef Steak Pie (French Style). 

Take a nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin; cut in small slices 
slice also a little raw ham ; put both in a frying-pan, with some 
butter and small quantity chopped onions ; let them simmer too 
gether a short time on the fire or in the oven ; add a little flout 
and enough stock to make sauce ; salt, pepper, chopped parsley 
and a little Worcestershire sauce as seasoning ; add also a few 
sliced potatoes, and cook together for about 20 minutes; put thiii 
into a pie-dish, with a few slices of hard boiled eggs on the topi 
and cover with a layer of common paste. Bake from 15 to 2c 
minutes in a well heated oven. All dark meat pies can be treatec 
precisely the same way. Tf poultry, leave the potatoes out. 

Frizzled Beef. 

(Mis§ Wister.) 

One quarter of a pound dressed beef cut as thin as Saratoga 
potatoes ; 3 ounces butter and Cottoleae mixed ; 2 teacupful 
milk ; 1 tablespoonful flour.

tablespoonful of salt, and V 2 tablespoonful of white pepper. On 
top of the steak, place 3 plantains, just fried in butter. The 
plantains are the red bananas. Over this pour l / 2 pint of be- 
chamel sauce and over the whole sprinkle a tablespoonful of 
grated horse radish. 

White House Steak. 

(Mrs. Sprague.) 
One pound of steak chopped very fine and freed from sinews ; 
and gristle. Mince fine a tablespoonful of onion and fry it a 
light brown in a little butter. Add the minced meat and an i| 
equal quantity of bread crumbs, season nicely, and moisten with 
a little cold gravy or stock of any kind. It must be just moist 
enough to mould into shape. Pressed in a small wine-glass they 
resemble pears, and after they are fried they should have a sprig 
of parsley inserted into the stem end ; or you may roll them round 
like sausages or make into little flat cakes. They must be dipped 
in crumbs, then in beaten egg, and again in crumbs. Make a 
little brown gravy to pour round them, or serve with a mush- 
room or tomato sauce.

Stewed Kidney. 

Put on a kidney early in the afternoon and let simmer till bed 
time, allow it to remain all night in the same water. Next 
morning ent into small pieces, and stew for an hour or more : 
make a brown gravy and just before serving add 2 hard boiled 
eggs, sliced. * 

Veal Croquettes. 

If for breakfast they can be prepared the night before, aud so 
be ready for the table in a few minutes. Chop the veal fine; mix 
Yz cup of sweet milk with about a teaspoouful of flour. Melt a 
piece of butter the size of an egg ( and stir the flour and milk in 
it ; then let it come to a boil. Mix this thoroughly with the meat; 
form it in balls or fiat cakes. 

To Stew Pork. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Take a nice piece of the leg of fresh pork ; rub it with a .little 
salt and score the skin. Put it into a pot with sufficient water 
to cover it, and stew it gently for two hours or more, according 
to its size. Then put into the same pot a dozen or more sweet 
potatoes, scraped and split and cut in pieces. Let the whole 
stew gently together for an hour and a half, or till it is thoroughly 
done. This stew will be found very good. For sweet potatoes 
you can substitute white ones mixed with sliced turnips, or 
parsnips scraped and split. 

Souse of Pigs Feet. 
1 Mrs. Owens.) 

Put the pigs' feet and cars, when well cleaned, over the fire in 
cold water. Boil till .tender; pour over them in a jar a pickle

Trim off skin and fat ; rub the chops over with a mixture of 
powdered sage and onion ; put small piece butter into a frying- 
pan ; put in the chops and cook slowly, as they should be well 
done. Lay chops on hot dish ; add a little hot water to gravy in 
pan; i large spoonful butter, rolled in flour; pepper, salt and 
sugar, and y z cup juice drained from canned tomatoes. The 
tomatoes themselves can be used for a tomato omelette. Stew 5 
minutes and pour over the chops and serve. 

How to Boil a Ham. 

Put a ham weighing ten pounds in a pot large enough to con- 
tain water enough to cover it. Bring to a boil gradually, then 
add 2 heads celery, 2 turnips, 3 onions, a bunch of savory herbs 
— the vegetables cut into dice. Let it simmer gently four hours. 
Remove the skin, sprinkle with pepper, put in a few cloves, and 
brown in a quick oven. 

Boiled Ham. 

Boil it 3 or 4 hours, according to sixe, then skin the whole and 
fit it for the table ; then set in oven for yi an hour, cover thickly 
with pounded rusk or bread crumbs, set back for y z an hour 
longer. Boiled ham is always improved by setting in an oven 
for nearly an hour, till much of the fat dries out, audit also makes 
it more tender. 

Ham Patties. 

One pint of ham. which has been previously cooked, mix with 
2 parts of bread crumbs, wet with milk. Put the batter iu gem 
pans, break 1 egg over each, sprinkle the top thickly with cracker

New England Boiled Dinner. 

(Juliet Corson.) 

Remove the bone from a compact cut of the round of corned beef 
weighing about 8 pounds, and tie the meat as closely as possible; 
put it in a deep pot, cover it with cold water, add a teaspoonful 
of salt and half a salt spoonful of pepper ; let it boil quickly, re* 
moving all scum ; wheu no more scum rises, put with it the fol - 
lowing vegetables, peeled and cut in slices two inches thick ; 2 
canots, four beets, four white turnips, and 1 yellow turnip, 6 
small onions peeled so that they will remain unbroken, and a 
large head of celery cut in two inch lengths. Place the pot 
where its contents will simmer slowly for two hours. A glass of 
wine, or any table sauce preferred, maybe added before the 
dish is finished. To serve it, put the meat in the middle of a 
platter, arrange the vegetables around it, and pour a little of the 
gravy over it. More of the gravy should be served in a small 
boat, with a dish of boiled potatoes. The united flavor of the 
meat and vegetables characterizes the dish. Cabbage and squash 
can be added when preferred. 

Scrapple. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Take such parts of the pork as are not used in packing — heart, 
tongue, portions of the head, etc., using about equal parts of lean 
and fat. Thoroughly clean them, and boil quite tender in water 
enough to cover the meat. When done take it up, remove the 
bones and thicken the water in which it was boiled with corn- 
meal until it is the consistency of mush. Let it boil a few min- 
utes and season with salt, pepper and summer savory. Chop the 
meat and return it to the mush, add salt and pepper to the taste, 
and let it cook a few minutes more. Dish it out and keep in a 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 47 

dry, cool place. Cut in slices and fry brown in Cottolene, as 
needed. Buckwheat meal is sometimes used with the cornmeal. 

To Prepare Tripe. 

Order it the day before you wish to serve it, scrape it thor- 
oughly, wash it in several waters, then boil in salt and water un- 
til it is perfectly tender]; let it drain in a platter all night. Next 
day cut it in small pieces and fry in hot lard after having rolled 
the pieces in flour. To serve with this make a rich, brown gravy, 
using a little of the lard in which the tripe was fried. If for 
breakfast, send bakedjpotatoes, fried apples, and tomatoes with 
it ; the tomatoes may be canned ones, cooked; and with thin 
slices of toasted bread put in the bottom of the dish. 

Croquettes of Sweetbreads. 

Blanch and braize 1 dozen sweetbreads. When cooked, cut them 
in small square pieces, also x / 2 can of mushrooms. Put in sauce- 
pan to cook, 2 finely chopped shalots or garlic with piece of 
butter ; add some Allemande sauce, reduce it, then add sweet- 
breads and mushrooms. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg and 
a little chopped parsley, add the yelks of 2 eggs, stir well, then 
put in pan to cool. Shape them in any desired form ; bread them 
with bread crumbs, fry in hot lard. Serve with mushroom or 
cream sauce. You may add beef tongues or truffles, cut in small 
squares.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



^ It is the bounty oj nature that we live ; but 0/ philosophy that 
ive live well. " Sen ec a . 

In roasting or boiling whole any fowl, truss it — which means to 
draw the thighs close to the body, cross the legs at the tail and 
tie firmly to the body with twine, which is removed before serv- 
ing ; or pass the legs through a slit in the skin near the tail, and 
skewer the wings close to the body. 

To broil, split the body down the back and lay it open. 

In cutting up fowl for fricassee do not break the bones, cut the 
joints. 

Fowls with white meat should be well cooked ; fowls with dark 
meat may be underdone. 

Flesh of game is apt to be tough when first killed. It is more 
tender if kept some time, or if frozen. 

Clean giblets thoroughly ; cook and chop them fine ; use them 
in the gravy or in the filling of roast fowl, or mix with bread- 
crumbs, well seasoned and moistened, brown in butter, and serve 
with the meat. 

Pigeons should be roasted in a quick oven. Large pigeons will 
roast in an hour ; a small one in half an hour. 

Ducks will roast in half an hour ; wild ducks in fifteen or 
twenty minutes. This time is for roasting rare. 

An ordinary-sized goose will roast in one hour. 

A large turkey will require three hours to roast. Use Cranberry 
sauce and current jelly with fowls, veal, ham and game. 

A spoonful of vinegar put into the water in which fowls are 
boiled makes them tender. The garnishes for turkey and chicken 



52 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

are parsley, fried oysters, thin slices of ham, slices of lemon and 
fried sausage. 

Roast Turkey. 

(Marion Harland.) 

After drawing the turkey, rinse out with several waters, and in 
next to the last mix a teaspoonful of soda. The inside of a fowl, 
especially if purchased in the market, is sometimes very sour, 
and imparts an unpleasant taste to the stuffing, if not to the inner 
part of the legs and side bones. The soda will act as a correc- 
tive, and is, moreover, very cleansing. Fill the body with this 
water, shake well, empty it out, and rinse with fair water. Then 
prepare a dressing of bread-crumbs, mix with butter, pepper, 
salt, thyme or sweet marjoram. You may, if you like, add the 
beaten yolks of two eggs. Mince a dosen oysters and stir into 
the dressing. The effect upon the turkey meat, particularly that 
of the breast, is very pleasant. 

Stuff the craw with this, and tie astring tightly about the neck, 
to prevent the escape of the stuffing. Then fill the body of the 
turkey, and sew it up with strong thread. This and the neck- 
string are to be removed when the fowl is dished. In roasting, ijf 
your fire is brisk, allow about ten minutes to the pound ; but it 
will depend very much upon the turkey's age whether this rule; 
holds good. Dredge it with flour before roasting, and baste often; 
at first with butter and water, afterward with the gravy in the 
dripping-pau. If you lay the turkey in the pan, put in with it a 
teacup of hot water. Many roast always upon a grating placed 
on the top of the pan. lu that case the boiling water steams the 
under part of the fowl, and prevents the skin from drying too 
fast, or cracking. Roast to a fine brown, ajid if it threatens to 
darken too rapidly, lay a sheet of white paper over it until the 
lower part is also done. 

Stew the chopped giblets in just enough water to cover them, 
and when the turkey is lifted from the pan, add these with the 
water in which they were boiled, to the drippings ; thicken with 1 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 53 

a spoonful of browned flour, wet with cold water to prevent lump- 
ing ; boil up once, and pour into the gravy-boat. 

Roast Turkey Without Stuffing. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

The best authorities on cooker}- now agree that to stuff poultry 
is to ruin its flavor ; and after once roasting a turkey without 
stuffing it, the housewife will ever after spare herself the labor of 
stuffing, which really does more harm than good. In dressing a 
turkey carefully remove every pin-feather, and singe off all hair. 

Take out the crop through a cut made lengthwise in the skin of 
the neck, cut off the neck close to the body, fold down the neck 
skin on the breast, and secure it neatly with a small skewer* 
Open the body on the under side between the legs, and after 
loosening from the inside of the carcass the thin membrance 
which holds the intestines, take out the latter in a ball, being 
particular that they are not torn apart and that the gall, which 
lies under the liver, is not broken. If there is no mishap in re- 
moving the intestines, the inside of the bird will not need to be 
washed, but should merely be wiped out with a damp cloth. 
Poultry or game is never washed nowadays, unless it actually 
needs cleansing. 

Carefully disengage the liver, gizzard aud heart from the intes- 
tines, and set them aside to cook. Truss the turkey by folding 
the wings backward upon the back, really turning them against 
the back at the first joint. Secure the legs firmly and compactly 
to the sides by skewers, dust the turkey with pepper, and place 
strips of salt pork upon the breast. Set in a hot oven, and after 
•thirty minutes diminish the heat. Roast without water, basting 
with the fat that cooks from the fowl ; and allow twenty minutes 
cooking to each pound of turkey, not counting the first half hour. 
Sprinkle with salt when nearly done. 

Place the heart, liver and gizzard on the fire in a stew-pan, and 
let them simmer, closely covered, for forty minutes ; then re- 
move, and chop finely. When the turkey is done, remove it to

Chicken Pie. 

(Mrs. D. W. Peetrey.) 

One quartflour, 3 teaspoons of baking powder, 1 teacup of lard 
and butter, mixed, rub well together and moisten with cold 
water, enough to roll. Line the sides of the baking dish, with 
dough one quarter of an inch in thickness. Place in the chicken, 
having been well cooked, boned and seasoned. Fill the dish 
half full of the broth, bits of butter and sprinkle heavily with 
flour. Put on the top crust, the edges laping under the sides. 
Cut several gashes to let the steam escape, and bake until brown, 
in a quick oven. 

Chicken Pie a la Reine. 

One half pound salt pork, x / z teaspoonful each celery, salt and 
thyme, 4 sprigs parsley, white pepper and salt to taste. Cut 
chicken up in small joints, the pork in neat scallops, stew gently 
in ii pints water, until nearly cooked. Line edge of pudding 
dish with paste, make layers of chicken, pork and seasonings, 
when used, sprinkle over the chopped parsley ; fill with the gravy, 
cover, ornament, and wash over with milk ; bake in steady oven 
40 minutes. 

Roast Chicken. 

Singe and truss carefully. Broilers, as they are called, are 
better without stuffing, unless very large. Season with salt, put 
small bits of butter over meat and place in pan with a little 
water ; baste occasionally and dredge with flour before taking

from oven. A spring chicken cooked in any style is not to be de- 
spised. But a well-known epicure once said : 

" To roast spring chicken is to spoil it 
Just split-down the back and broil it." 

Chicken Pie with Oysters. 

(Mrs. Parker.) 

Boil a good sued chicken until tender, drain off the liquor 
from quart of oysters. Line the sides and bottom of a large, 
round pan with crust, put in a layer of oysters and a layer of 
chicken until the pan is full. Season with pepper, salt, bits of 
Cottolene and the oyster liquor, add some of the chicken liquor. 
Cover with crust and bake. Serve with sliced lemon. 

Chicken a la Terrapin, 

(Miss Helen L. Johnson.) 

Make a rice border, as follows : Wipe il cups of rice on a 
soft towel. Cover with i quart of boiling stock and boil for 20 
minutes. Then stand at the back of the stove for 15 minutes. 
Drain if necessary ; season ; press into a well greased border 
mold. Bake in a moderate oven for 20 minutes. Turn out of 
the mold. 

While the rice is baking, prepare the chicken as follows : Take 
1 pint of chicken meat. Add to it 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 
rubbed smooth with 1 of flour. Stand over a moderate fire un- 
til heated, and add ]A cup of cream, the whites of 2 hard boiled 
eggs mashed through a sieve ; add to the yolks mashed and 
rubbed to a paste, 2 tablespoonfuls of cream. Stir this into the 
chicken, and let it come to boiling point. Season with salt, pep- 
per and 1 tablespoonful of parsley chopped fine. Put in the cen- 
tre of the border mold, and serve on a circular platter. 

Smothered Chicken.

Cover closely and bake until tender. When done, take from pan 
and make a gravy. 

Yankee Potpie. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.)

up a young chicken, soak for half an hour in salt and water, 
wipe dry, season with pepper, roll in flour, and fry in hot fat 
until each piece is of a rich brown color. Take up and set 
aside in a warming closet. Pour into the gravy 1 cupful of milk 
— half cream is better ; thicken with 1 spoonful of flour, and add 
1 spoonful of butter and chopped parsley ; boil up and pour over 
the hot chicken, or, if preferred, serve without the cream gravy, 
with bunches of fried parsley. Plain boiled rice should accom- 
pany this.

chopped onions. Mix with them 1 dessertspoonful of sage, 1 
tablespoouful of bread crumbs and pepper and salt. Fasten se- 
curely. Put an ounce of butter into a saucepan and fry the duck 
until it is nicely browned. Then put in the stew pan gravy to 
half cover the duck, with an onion cut in slices. Simmer for 
three-quarters of an hour. Take up the duck and keep it hot, 
while you strain and take the grease off the gravy. Boil the 
gravy until reduced one-half. Return the duck to the gravy and 
keep hot for a quarter of an hour. Serve with a puree of peas. 

Wild Ducks Roasted. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Prepare for roasting the same as any fowl. Parboil for 15 
minutes with an onion in the water, and the strong fishy flavor 
that is sometimes so disagreeable in wild ducks will have disap- 
peared. A carrot will answer the same purpose. Stuff with 
bread crumbs, a minced onion, season with pepper, salt and sage, 
and roast until tender. Use butter plentifully in basting. A half 
hour will suffice for youug ducks. 

Stewed Pigeons. 

Slice 6 onions and fry in butter a nice brown, clean pigeons 
whole ; put in each a little salt, pepper and parsley ; take the 
onions from the butter, fry the birds a nice brown, add water 
and the onions, thicken and stew them about one and a half 
hours.

Quail. 

Split them open at the back and broil them ; the inside must 
invariably be broiled first. Serve on toast. 

Carried Rabbit. 

(S. C. B.) 

Boil a pound of pickled pork for three-quarters of an hour, 
with three onions, a sprig of thyme and i quart of water. Put in 
the rabbit and boil gently for half an hour. Take up the rabbit 
and pork. Cut up the former into joints, and the pork in neat 
slices. Put back into the liquor the head, neck, liver and bits of 
rabbit left with the bones and trimmings of the pork, and let 
boil for an hour ; then strain and skim the liquor free from fat. 
Reduce to one-half by boiling without the lid ; put in the pork 
and rabbit, and allow them to simmer gently half an hour. Rub 
the onions to a pulp, add them to i gill of milk or cream, 
i tablespoon ful of flour, i teaspoonful of curry powdei and i tea- 
spoonful of curry paste. Put this to the gravy ; stir over the fire 
until it has thickened, and serve with well-boiled rice on a sepa- 
rate dish. 

Squirrel Pie. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Clean one pair of squirrels and cut into small pieces. Wipe 
off with a damp cloth. Put into a stew pan with two slices of 
salt pork, and water to nearly cover. Cook until half done. 
Season it well and thicken the gravy. Pour into a deep dish, 
cover with pie-crust, and bake 30 minutes. Squirrels may be 
fried, broiled, or stewed, like chickens or rabbits. 

Woodcock. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Many excellent cooks do not draw them, asserting that the 
trail should be left in, even by those who do not like it, and 






THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 61 

removed after it is served. They claim that the flavor of the 
bird is much impaired if the trail is taken out before cooking. 
It looks rather plausible, as they are said to live by suction, have 
no crop, and a stomach only the sue of a bullet. The trail, 
head, and neck are regarded as great delicacies tiy epicures. 
For my own eating, I could not cook them without drawing. 

Neck of Venison. 

(S. L. B.) 

Remove the bones, roll up the meat and tie tightly. Wrap the 
meat thus prepared in buttered paper. Put in a pan and baste 
frequently. An hour and a half will cook it. Remove the paper 
sprinkle pepper and salt over the meat, brown with butter. Fry 
the venison bones with two sliced onions, some gravy and a 
bacon bone or two, and make a rich gravy. Another sauce is 
made by dissolving a little currant jelly in the sauce, adding a 
lump of butter, a few drops of Chili vinegar and a glass of port 
wine. 

Dressing for Broiled Game. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Mix an ounce of butter with about a teaspoonful of unmade 
mustard, salt, a dust of cayenne and a few drops of vinegar, or, 
if preferred, lemon juice. Score the flesh pretty deeply, coat it 
thickly with the above mixture and broil over a clear fire. 

Potato Stuffing for Poultry and Game. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Potato stuffing may be used for any fowl, though it is better 
for ducks and geese. Take about 2 cups of mashed potatoes, 1 
teaspoonful of onion juice or 2 spoonfuls of fine chopped onion, 
y 2 cupful of milk or cream, 1 tablespoonful of butter, black pep- 
per, salt, tablespoonful of chopped parsley ; many like yolk of 
egg, about 2 to the above quantity ; mix and beat well.

VEGETABLES. 



'• Capitis Nidore Culince." 

Boil fresh, young vegetables in hard water ; a little salt will 
harden the water at once. 

Boil dried vegetables in soft water ; a little baking soda will 
soften water, and is useful in freshening and making tender green 
vegetables that are a little old or not wholly fresh. A little sugar 
is an improvement to beets, turnips and squash. 

Cabbage, turnips, carrots, parsnips and beets are good boiled 
with fresh meats. When vegetables are served with salt meats, 
they are good boiled in the liquor in which the meat has been 
cooked ; take out the meat when done ; then cook the vegetables. 

Underdone vegetables are unpardonable. 

Boil cnions, medium size, one hour ; green corn, twenty to 
twenty-five minutes ; peas and asparagus, twenty to twenty-five 
minutes; potatoes half an hour; if very small, less time; cab- 
bage and cauliflower, twenty -five mintues to half an hour; carrots 
and turnips, forty-five minutes when young ; one hour in winter ; 
Lima beans, if young, half an hour; old, forty-five minutes; 
beets, one hour in summer, an hour and a half or even 2 hours, 
if large, in winter ; string beans, if slit or sliced and thin, half an 
hour; if only snapped, forty -five minutes. Regulate this time 
always by the time the meat will be done. 

Vegetable oysters are good with every kind of meat. Beets 
peas and beans with boiled or roast meats. Carrots, parsnips, 
turnips, greens and cabbage are eaten with boiled meats. Mashed 
turnips, onions and apple sauce with roast pork. Tomatoes with 



68 THE UNIVERSAL COOK- BOOK. 






every kind of meat. If sweet potatoes are lacking flavor, place 
them in the sun for a few days — a week, when they will have 
their natural flavor. 

Baked Potatoes. 

Time, i hour. Take as many large potatoes as you wish, wash 
clean, then wipe dry, put them into quick oven for i hour. Serve 
them in napkin, with cold butter, pepper and salt. 

Saratoga Potatoes 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Peel and slice thin into cold water. Drain well, and dry in a 
towel. Fry a few at a time in boiling Cottolene. Salt as you take 
them out, and lay them on coarse brown paper for a short time. 
They are very nice cold for lunch, or to take to picnics. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 

Boil, peel and slice 6 potatoes. Put a sliced onion into a hot 
buttered frying-pan. When a little brown, put in the potatoes, 
Season, and when a golden brown, sprinkle over them a table- 
spoon chopped parsley. A combination of onion and parsley al- 
ways means Lyonnaise. 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

Butter a baking dish, pare potatoes and slice thin, put in dish 
a layer of potatoes, and sprinkle with salt, pepper and a little but- 
ter ; then another layer of potatoes, etc., until dish is nearly full. 
Then fill with milk or cream. Bake one hour and a half. 

Roasted Potatoes with Beef. 

(Mrs. John Patterson.) 

Pare the potatoes and place in the pan on the rack with the 
meat, basting when you do the beef. They will be nicely 
browned, and mealy when the meat is done. 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 69 

Potato Puff. 

(Marion Harland. ) 

Take 2 cupfuls of cold mashed potato, and stir into it 6 tea- 
spoonfuls of melted Cottolene, beating to a white cream before 
adding anything else. Then put with this 2 eggs whipped very 
light and 1 teacupful of cream or milk, salting to taste. Beat all 
well, pour into a deep dish, and bake in a quick oven until it is 
nicely browned. If properly mixed, it will come out of the oven 
light, puffy and delectable. 

Potato Croquettes. 

(Mrs. E. C. Bixby.) 

Pare, boil, and mash 6 good-sized potatoes. Add 1 tablespoon- 
ful of butter, Z A, of a cupful of hot cream or milk, the whites of 
2 eggs well beaten, salt and pepper to taste. When cool enough 
to handle, work into shape, roll in egg and bread crumbs, and 
fry in hot lard. 

Baked Mushrooms. 

Place some large flat ones, nicely cleaned and trimmed, 011 thin 
slices of well buttered toast, putting a little piece of butter in 
each, as also a pinch of pepper and salt ; lay them on a baking 
tray and cover them carefully ; heap the hot ashes upon them, 
and let them bake on the hearth for fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Fried Mushrooms. 

When peeled put them into hot butter and let them heat 
thoroughly through — too much cooking toughens them ; season 
well with butter, pepper and salt ; serve on buttered toast ; a 
teaspoonful of wine or vinegar on each mushroom is a choice 
method. 

Broiled Mushrooms.

Stuffed Tomatoes. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

Twelve large smooth tomatoes, 1 teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper, 1 tablespoonful of butter, 1 of sugar, 1 cupful of bread 
crumbs, 1 teaspoonful of onion juice. Arrange the tomatoes in a 
baking pan. Cut a thin slice from the smooth end of each. With 
a small spoon scoop out as much of the pulp and juice as possi- 
ble without injuring the shape. When all have been treated in 
this way, mix the pulp and juice with the other ingredients, and 
fill the tomatoes with this mixture. Put on the tops and bake 
slowly three quarters of an hour. Slide the cake turner under 
the tomatoes and lift gently onto a flat dish. Garnish with pars- 
ley and serve.

72 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

Onions Stuffed With Kidneys. 

Peel six large onions, cut about an inch from the top of each, 
scoop out the center so as to admit a piece of kidney about an 
inch square, lay the onions in a saucepan, season them with 
salt and pepper, cover them with cold gravy or broth of any 
kind, and stew them gently for 2 hours ; take them up carefully 
without breaking them and serve them hot. The pieces cut 
from them should be chopped fine, mixed with any bits of kid- 
ney remaining from the dish, mixed with double their quantity 
of cold chopped potatoes, or bread soaked in cold water, and 
fried for a supper dish. Any kind of kidneys can be used. 

Boiled Onions. 

Choose small onions, unless they are too tiny, allow one for 
each guest. Place them on the stove in hot water, and let them 
simmer gently for ten minutes ; then change the water, and cook 
them until tender. Make a cream sauce of the following : 
\ x / 2 pint of milk, 1 tablespoon ful of butter, 2 tablespoonfuls of 
flour, y 2 teaspoonful of salt. Wet the flour with some of the 
milk, and add it to the balance of the milk when the latter is 
heat ed to the boiling point. Stir the sauce until it is creamy, 
and then add the salt and butter. Place the onions in the serv- 
ing dish, pour over them the cream sauce, add a dusting of pep- 
per, and serve. 

Fried Onions- 
Peel (holding onions and hands under water to prevent tears), 
wash and cut crosswise so as to form undivided rings. Flour them, 
fry 5 or 6 minutes. Drain, sprinkle with salt and pepper, serve 
with beefsteak. 

Cauliflower an Parmesan. 

-Boil a fine, firm head of cauliflower in boiling salted water 
for twenty minutes. While boiling prepare a cream sauce with 
a tablespoonful of butter melted without browning, 1 tablespoon- 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 73 

ful of flour ; stir until smooth. Add oue cup of cream, and stir 
until it thickens. Add 2 tablespoonfuls of Parmesan cheese, 
and a dash of white pepper. Grease a baking dish; cut the cau- 
liflower in pieces ; put a layer, first of cauliflower, then of the 
sauce, and continue until all is used. Sprinkle the top with bread 
crumbs and brown in a quick oven. 

Boiled Cauliflower. 

Cut off the leaves, also stalk close to the bottom of the flowers. 
Place for a few moments in cold water, then put in salted boil- 
ing water and cook until tender. A piece of coarse netting tied 
about it will prevent its breaking. Serve hot with a little drawn 
butter poured over it, and each person eating with a little vine- 
gar if they desire. 

Turnips a la Creme. 

Cut peeled turnips into half inch dice, boil in salted water and 
drain, pour over a cream sauce made of 1 cup hot milk poured 
gradually over 1 tablespoonful each butter and flour rubbed to- 
gether. vSalt and pepper. 

macaroni, with Cheese. 

(Juliet Corson. ) 

The importance of this article of food is beginning to be real- 
ized in this country, and now it remains only to learn how to 
cook it palatably. Carefully follow the directions given and you 
cannot fail to produce a delicious, dish of macaroni, fit for the 
most finished epicure's taste. 

First of all, remember that good macaroni is always of a yel- 
lowish color. That which has a white, blanched appearance is 
decidedly inferior, You can buy the genuine Italian macaroni 
at the Italian stores generally to be found in our large cities, or 
from regular grocers or dealers in general stores. It costs in 
New York fifteen cents a pound. One pound after being prop- 
erly boiled is increased in quantity about fourfold. To boil it

properly have a large pot or saucepan two-thirds full of water on 
the fire, put a level tablespoouful of salt into it to every quart of 
water, and when it is boiling fast throw into it the macaroni, 
wiped with a clean dry cloth, but not washed. Let it boil until 
it yields easily to pressure between the fingers ; then drain it in a 
colander, and rinse it thoroughly in cold water ; let it stand in 
cold water until you are ready to finish it according to any given 
recipe. The following is an excellent one. 

Put into a saucepan one ounce each of butter and flour, and stir 
them together over the fire until they form a smooth, thick paste. 
Meantime put a little milk and water (about a gill of each; to 
boil, and when they are at the boiling point pour them gradually 
into the butter and flour, and stir altogether with an egg -whip. 

If thicker than pudding sauce add a little boiling water ; when 
the sauce has boiled up once, season it to taste with pepper, salt 
and just a grating of nutmeg. It is then ready for the macaroni, 
which must be put in it to be heated ; while this is heating grate 
two ounces of hard, dry cheese, and mix it with the macaroni, 
which can be served as soon as it is hot. Or you can make it a 
little nicer by putting it on a shallow metal dish, sprinkling it 
well with bread or cracker crumbs, putting a few bits of butter 
on top of it and browning it in the oven. Macaroni prepared in 
this way is one of the most palatable of dishes, as well as one of 
the most wholesome and economical of foods. 

Hot Slaw. 

(Mrs. Parker.) 

Chop fine and sprinkle over with flour. Put a small piece of 
butter in the oven to melt. Salt and pepper the cabbage, and 
put in the pan with the butter. Mix >4 a teacupful of cream, 1 
egg, 1 tablespoonful of mustard, 1 teaspoonful of sugar, and heat 
thoroughly. Serve warm . 

Hubbard Squash

76 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

and bake for one hour. Remove from the oven, scrape the soft 
pulp from the shell, season well with butter, salt and pepper, and 
serve very hot. 

Vegetable Oysters. 

Cut them in thin slices, boil in clear water until soft, then pick 
a little codfish fine and add to the oysters, boil all together a few 
minutes, then season the same as oysters. Eat with crackers. 

Hulled Corn. 

One quart of corn, put to soak at night in warm water ; in the 
morning change the water to enough to boil it in, putting in a 
rounding teaspoonful of soda and boil till it will hull. Rinse as 
usual. 

Succotash. 

Boil i quart lima or string beans until tender, cut down the 
middle the grains of i dozen ears corn, and scrape. Drain off 
water from beans, add the corn, season with salt, pepper and a 
good lump of butter. If too dry add a little cream or milk. 
Cook twenty minutes after adding the corn. 

Stewed Celery. 

(Mrs. Parker.) 

Clean the heads, take off the coarse, outer leaves. Cut in small 
pieces and stew. When tender, add cream, butter, and a little 
flour. Season to taste. 

Celery. 

This is no longer served in a high glass, but in a low, flat dish 
that is much more elegant in appearance. Celery stalks should 
be scrubbed lengthwise with a small brush kept for the purpose, 
aud should then be well rinsed and all rusty lines scraped off 
with a silver knife. The simple dishes of a meal are the ones to 
be most watchful of, and one of these is celery, which is too often 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 77 

only half cleansed, and served in anything but an appetizing 
manner. 



Do not break the skins in washing or they will loose their 
color in cooking. Boil one hour in hot, slightly salt water. Rub 
off the skins, split in half, dish, and pour on them a boiling mix- 
ture of 1 tablespoonful of melted butter, 1 of vinegar and a little 
pepper and salt. Serve very hot. 

Stewed Spinach. 

Dress in the ordinary way, and then chop fine and then rub 
through a wire sieve ; put into a stew pan on the fire with some 
fresh butter, salt, white pepper, and grated nutmeg; stir, and 
add a piece of fiare, a little more butter, and mix well ; then 
serve with sippets, fried in butter. 

Parsnips (Fried.) 

(M. C. H.) 

Wash, scrape, clean and boil until quite tender. Drain ; slice 
the long way of the parsnips, and fry in good dripping. Serve 
hot ; lay them on a clean napkin to absorb the grease. They 
are very nice cooked this way. 

Egg Plant. 

Peel and cut in thin slices across the egg plant. Lay for half 
an hour in salt and water. Before cooking lay in flour, and fry 
in lard until well browned. Eat very hot. 

Cabbages Cooked in Cream. 

Take 2 quarts of chopped cabbage, boil until tender and the 
water is nearly gone ; then pour in % of a cup of cream, with 
salt and pepper to the taste ; boil fifteen minutes, and serve ; or, 
instead of the cream use vinegar, with butter the size of a wal- 
nut, and you have <l hot slaw."

of butter and lard. 

Fried Egg Plant. 

Peel egg plants, slice thin, sprinkle little salt over them, and 
let them iemain y 2 an hour; wipe slices dry, dip them into 
beaten yolk of egg, then into grated cracker, fry them light 
brown in boiling lard, seasoning slightly with pepper while they

them with corn meal, flour, or corn starch, and fry brown. 

Green Peas. 

Shell the peas and wash well in cold water. Cook in boiling

pepper and salt. Serve hot. 

Boiled Asparagus. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Cut and peel the tough ends of the asparagus, tie it in little 
bunches and let it remain in cold water until ready to cook. 
Then put in a kettle of salted boiling water, and let it boil

SALADS. 






" lo make a perfect salad there should be a spendthrift for oil, a 
miser for vinegar, a wise man for salt, and a maplcap to stir the in- 
gredients up and mix them well together. — Spanish Proverb. 

Salads are very suitable for warm weather, or any weather, 
and there are few vegetables and few varieties of fish, flesh and 
fowl from which a salad cannot be made. 

To have your vegetables crisp and fresh, soak them in cold 
water for an hour, dry them with a soft towel, and keep them in 
a cool place till you use them. Meats and fish may be cut up, 
and kept in a cool place, but do not mix the dressing with any 
salad until you are ready to serve. Any of the dressings given 
make good salads. Lettuce is the best vegetable for meat and 
fish salads, but other " greens " may be used. Some think meat 
and fish salads improved if seasoned with a little French dressing 
before made up with mayonnaise dressing. The hostess always 
serves the soup, salad and dessert, and it is now customary for 
her to make the dressing for a salad at table in the presence of 
her guests.

(Mrs. J. W. Webb.) 

Shred or chop a head of white cabbage and pour over it the

of an egg. Place in double boiler stirring constantly until thick.

sauce with the liquor and other ingredients just named. Chop 
the raw oysters, and stir in when you do the butter ; boil five 
minutes, and pour into the tureen. Some put in the oysters 
whole, considering that the sauce is handsomer than when they 
are chopped. 

Oyster sauce is used for boiled halibut, cod, and other fish, for 
boiled turkey, chickens, and white meats generally.

CHEESE. 



Cheese is not found upon our tables often enough. It is an ex- 
cellent digestant, when eaten moderately and is more nutritious 
than meats. The soft cheeses are richest and should be kept in 
a box in a cool dry place. 

Cheese dishes prepared by these receipts may be served at 
lunch, dinner or tea with a salad. 

Cheese Straws. 

(Miss G. E. Merrill.) 

Mix together 4 tablespoonfuls flour, pinch of salt, a very little 
cayenne pepper, and 3 ounces grated cheese. Add the beaten 
yolk of 1 egg, and then enough iced water to make a very stiff 
paste. Roll the paste on a board, into a sheet % inch thick. 
Cut the sheet into strips >£ inch wide, and 5 inches long; and 
bake them about ten minutes in a very hot oven. 

Welsh Rarebit. 

(Mrs. Rorer.) 

Two cups grated cheese ; 2 egg yolks ; y z cup milk ; salt and 
cayenne to taste. 

Toast carefully slices of bread with the crusts removed. While 
hot, butter them, and then plunge in a bowl of hot water. Place 
on a heated dish and stand in the oven to keep warm while you 
make the rarebit. Put the milk in a porcelain lined or granite 
saucepan ; stand it over a moderate fire ; when boiling hot, add 
the cheese ; stir continually until the cheese is melted ; add the 



102 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

salt, cayenne and yolks, and pour it over the toasted bread. If 
the rarebit is stringy and tough, it is the fault of the cheese not 
being rich enough to melt. 

Old English dairy cheese makes the best Welsh rarebit. 

Welsh Rarebits. 

Put a little milk in a saucepan and set it on a moderate fire ; 
cut up in slices some new cheese and put into the saucepan ; stir 
the whole thoroughly until the cheese is melted and well mixed 
with the milk. Only a small portion of milk is necessary, say 
about one-eighth. Have some pieces of toast ready buttered, and 
on the bottom of a dish. When the cheese is thoroughly melted 
and mixed, pour it upon the toast and serve while hot. 

Cheese Fonda. 

Pour yi a pint of boiling milk on the crumbs of a French roll, 
beat it up with a quarter of a pound of good cheese, grated, and 
the yolks of 2 well beaten eggs. Just as it is ready for the oven 
add the whites of 4 eggs, frothed. Bake in a quick oven in a 
deep dish. Serve immediately. 

Cheese Souffle. 

This dish must be sent to table direct from the oven in the pan 
in which it has been baked, as it falls if kept standing. Beat 
separately the whites and yolks of 2 eggs, add to the yolks 1 
tablespoonful of sifted flour, 2 of grated cheese, a pinch of cay- 
enne, one of salt, and 1 cup of milk; when well mixed add the 
whites beaten to a froth, and stir briskly, pour into a buttered 
shallow pan, and bake in a quick oven until a rich brown — 
about fifteen minutes. 

Cottage Cheese. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

Place 3 quarts bonny-clabber over the fire and when it curdles 
drain it through a seive. To this curd, add 1 cup sweet cream, 






THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 103 

or work in yi cup butter, salt to taste and place in a cheese cloth, 
bag and hang up to dry, or press it into moulds. 

Deviled Biscuit. 

(Miss Parloa.) 

One tablespoonful Parmesan cheese ; 1 tablespoonful dry mus- 
tard ; 1 tablespoonful olive oil ; l / z teaspoonful salt ; one-fifth 
teaspoonful cayenne ; 2 tablespoonfuls milk. 

Mix these ingredients together and spread the mixture lightly 
upon half a dozen soda biscuit, and toast over a hot fire. Serve 
immediately. * 

If objection be made to the use of oil, substitute a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter. Only a delicate flavor is given to the bis- 
cuit by the ingredients named ; and if a strong taste be desired, 
double the quantity of materials for the mixture. 

Curried Cheese. 

One dozen rolled crackers, % pound grated cheese, salt, butter 
and curry powder to taste. Moisten with sweet milk, drop in 
hot gem-pan, bake 20 minutes. Serve with tomato sauce.

EGGS. 



Eggs half a day old are better for the cook than the "fresh laid 
egg." 

Do not poach eggs that are not fresh. Serve bread with eggs,. 
Eggs prepared in some of the receipts here given are served at 
lunch instead of soup. 

Before beating eggs let them remain in cold water a little while. 

Miss Helen Louise Johnson says : "There are several hundred 
ways of cooking eggs, this means largely that there are several 
hundred ways of making sauces to go over boiled eggs. There 
is more art in boiling an egg than is generally supposed. The 
albumen hardens at a low temperature, about 160 degrees, and 
the egg should be put in water but little hotter than this and al- 
lowed to stand till they are cooked. They are like coffee in this 
respect and should never be really ' boiled'." 

Many physicians tell us, -however, that an egg should be boiled 
from y z to 1 hour to be the most easily digested. To tell good 
eggs from bad eggs — put them in water and the bad eggs will 
stand on end, the good ones will lie on the side. To keep eggs, 
put a 2 inch layer of salt in a stone jar, then a layer of fresh eggs 
— large end down — so on till the jar is full, with a layer of salt at 
top, cover and put in a cool place. Or the eggs may be rubbed 
over with lard and packed in oats or bran. 

Poached Eggs. 

Break the eggs, one at a time, into a saucer. Place water in a 
saucepan, salt it well, and when it is simmering, drop each egg 



106 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

lightly in, cooking but one egg at a time if the saucepan is small. 
More may be cooked at once by using a large frying-pan. The^ 
water should not be allowed to boil while the eggs are cooking, 
but should be kept just at the boiling point. With a spoon throw 
the water carefully on top of the egg to whiten it. The beauty of 
a poached egg lies in the yolk blushing through the white, which 
should be just sufficiently hardened to form a veil for the yolk. 
When cooked enough, take out the egg with a perforated ladle, 
trim the ragged edges, and slip the egg upon a small piece of 
thin, buttered toast. When all the eggs have been cooked andc 
placed upon their separate pieces of toast, add to each a bit of: 
butter and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Muffin rings aret 
sometimes set in the water to give the eggs an even shape. If i 
liked, sorrel may be sprinkled over the eggs. 

Mrs. Hathaway's Omelet. 

Three eggs, beaten separately, x / 2 cup milk, i teaspoon ful corna 
starch, i tablespoonful melted butter added lastly. Put in hott 
skillet ; cook and fold ; chopped ham sprinkled on before fold 
ing improves it. Serve at once. 

Bread Crumb Omelet. 

(Mrs. Allyn.) 

Two-thirds of a pint of fine dried bread crumbs, a teaspoonfull 
of dried parsley, i spoonful of finely minced onions, 2 eggs, 1 
pint of good sweet milk, 1 tablespoonful of butter and pepper 
and salt. Beat the eggs to a froth and mix with the milk. Then 
add the other ingredients. Butter a pan, put the crumbs in it, 
and pour the mixture over it. Bake to a light brown and serve 
at once. 

French Economical Omlette.

Curried Eggs. 

(Miss Parloa.) 

Six hard boiled eggs ; 1 cupful stock ; y 2 cupful cream or milk; 
: teaspoouful chopped oniou ; 3 tablespoon fuls butter; 1 table- 
;poonful flour ; 1 teaspoouful curry powder ; salt and pepper to 
aste. 

After cooking the onion and butter in a small frying pan for 
;hree minutes put in the flour and curry powder ; stir the liquid 
intil it becomes smooth ; then add the stock and milk and some 
seasoning, and cook for ten minutes. Quarter the eggs and 
place them in a deep saucepan ; strain the sauce over them, and 
after simmering for three minutes, serve ver} r hot, with toast. 

The teaspoonful of curry powder gives a delicate flavor. More 
may be used if one desires. 

Shirred or Baked Eggs. 

(Miss Wister.) 

Break each egg into a cup first, so that the yolk is not brok- 
en, put all into a buttered dish or saucepan in which they may 
be served ; put a little salt on each egg and bake in the oven 
until the whites are firm. Add a little butter and serve at once. 
Nice little egg shirrers, holding one or two eggs, are made for 
this purpose. The eggs are also very nice baked on slices of 
toast, or in any gravy you may have left from poultry. 

Fricasseed Eggs. 

(Miss Curry.) 

I Boil 6 eggs hard. When cold cut in slices about yi inch thick 
and dip in beaten egg and then in cracker or bread crumbs. 
Fry in very hot oil or lard. 

Pickled Eggs. 

(Mrs. Owens.) 
Boil eggs very hard and remove the shell. Take 1 teaspoonful

each of cinnamon, allspice and mace ; put in a little muslin baj 
in cold water ; boil well, and if it boils away add enough to make: 
yi pint when the spices are taken out ; add i pint of strong vine* 
gar ; pour over the eggs. If you want them colored put in somt 
beet juice. 

Eggs upon Toast. 

(Mrs. Chas. Merrill.) 

Put a good lump of butter into the frying pan. When it is hot, 
stir in 4 or 5 well beaten eggs, with pepper, salt and a little pars ; 
ley. Stir and toss for three minutes. Have ready to your hanc 
some slices of buttered toast (cut round with a tin cake-cuttei: 
before they are toasted) ; spread thickly with ground or minced' 
tongue, chicken or ham. Heap the stirred egg upon these in, 
mounds, and set in a hot dish garnished with parsley and pick- 
led beets. 

Birds' Nest. 

(Practical Housekeeping.) 

Boil the eggs hard, remove shells, surround with forcemeat : 
fry or bake them till nicely browned, cut in halves and place' 
in a dish with grayy.

BREAD and BREAKFAST 
CAKES, BISCUIT 

I and ROLLS. 

"Here is bread which strengthens men's hearts, 
And therefore is called, ''The Staff of life.'" 1 . 

Good bread makes the homliest meal acceptable and the 
coarsest fare appetizing, while the most luxurious table is not 
even tolerable without it. Light crisp rolls for breakfast, spongy y 
sweet bread for dinner, and flaky biscuit for supper, cover a 
multitude of culinary sins : and there is no one thing on which 
the health of a family so much depends, as the quality of its 
home-made loaves. Three things are indispensable to success in 
bread making: good flour, good yeast and good judgment. 
The use of Gluten Bread is very healthful. Graham flour is 
made both from white and amber wheat, the former possesses 
more delicacy, the latter more gluten. For family use the F S 
White Wheat Graham is superior. It makes healthful and nutri- 
tious bread particularly for those troubled with indigestion. 

Bread and biscuit should rise in a moderately warm place. 
If too cold it will be heavy ; if too hot it will be sour. 

Should a batch of dough become sour, a teaspoonful of soda 
will help it, but this should be used only in an emergency. 

To have your bread rise quickly, double the quantity of yeast 
but watch it ; do not let it sour. 



H4 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

Bread should rise to twice its original size before it is ready to 
bake. 

Bake small loaves rather than large ones. Do not have thej 
loaf too large for the pan ; it will be a bad shape. 

Biscuit and rolls require a hotter oven than bread and a longer 
time to rise. 

A little sugar or a little Cottolene mixed with the rising will 
keep bread moist. 

Do not put a cloth around bread or biscuit if put in a tin box: 

In using baking powder or other chemicals with salt, mix them 
thoroughly with the flour by twice putting all through the sievec 
together. An even teaspoonful of baking powder to a cupful oi> 
flour is a good proportion. 

Two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar and one teaspoonful oi> 
soda is equal to two teaspoonsfuls of baking powder. Always 
si/t your flour. 

Bread. 

(Mrs. Webb.) 

Boil 3 medium sized potatoes, mash smoothly, add i teacuptul 
sifted flour. Add the water in which the potatoes were boiledi 1 
When hot, beat thoroughly, then add i tablespoonful salt, i table- 
spoonful shortening and i pint cold water and l / 2 cake com- 
pressed yeast. Add sufficient flour to thicken, knead at once, 
until it will not stick to the board. Raise in covered pan over: 
night. Iu the morning knead slightly and make into loaves. 
Raise double its size. Bake in moderate oven. 

Compressed Teast Bread. 

(Juliet Corson.) 

When it is possible to obtain fresh compressed yeast, also 
called German yeast, an excellent bread can be made in about 
two hours and half; the rapidity of the leavening, or "raising," 
the dough is advantageous, because less of the nutritive elements 



THE UNIVERSAL COOKBOOK. 115 

of the flour are lost than by following the long process ; for two 
loaves of bread use 3 pounds of flour; about a quart of water ; 
2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and an ounce of fresh compressed yeast ; 
dissolve the yeast in a pint of lukewarm water ; stir into it suffi- 
cient flour to make a thick batter ; cover the bowl containing the 
batter or sponge with a folded towel, and set it in a warm place 
to rise ; if properly covered and heated, it will rise to a light 
foam in about half an hour; then stir into it the salt, dissolved 
in a little warm water ; add the rest of the flour and sufficient 
lukewarm water to make a dough stiff enough to knead ; knead 
it five minutes ; divide it into two loaves, put them into buttered 
baking-pans, cover them with a folded towel, and set them in a 
warm place to rise twice their height ; then bake the loaves until 
each one is thoroughly done. In raising the sponge, be sure that 
the heat is not sufficient to " scald" or harden it, as that will pre- 
vent fermentation ; therefore do not place it where the hand can- 
not be held with comfort ; keep it covered from draughts. Add 
the rest of the flour. 

The dough made for home-made bread can be baked as raised 
biscuit ; and it can be made a little nicer by kneading in with it 
a tablespoonful each of sugar and melted butter ; or it can be 
boiled in soups and stews as raised dumplings. 

To test the heat of the oven follow the method of Jules Gouffe, 
the celebrated chef oi the Paris Jockey club; the "moderate 
oven" temperature is that degree of heat which will turn ordi- 
nary writing paper dark yellow or buff, that is, the color of kind- 
ling wood ; put a sheet of paper in the oven and close the door ; 
if the paper blazes the oven is too hot; arrange the dampers to 
lower the heat for ten minutes; then again test it with more 
paper ; it may be necessary to try the temperature several 
times. 

Premium Bread.

medium sized loaves use 3 tablespoon fuls of yeast; set it to rise, 
and when light mix stiff, adding butter the size of a black, wal- 
nut, and sufficient salt ; mould down two or three times thor- 
oughly before making into loaves ; then mould the loaves, and 
as soon as light bake 1 hour in a hot oven. 

Teast for Above. 

One quart water, 1 handful hops, 3 grated potatoes, medium 
sized, half cup sugar, half cup salt, and a teaspoonful of ground 
ginger. Boil the hops, strain, then add the other ingredients and 
boil for a couple of minutes. 

Graham Bread No. 1. 

One pint of water or milk, 1 yeast cake, or 1 cup of yeast. 
Wheat flour. About nine o'clock at night dissolve the yeast 
cake in the water, which should be lukewarm, and add enough 
wheat flour to form a stiff batter. Stir and beat the batter thor- 
oughly for 5 minutes, leaving it full of bubbles ; and set it in a 
warm place to rise. In the morning measure the following : 

One cupful of molasses, 1 teaspoonful of soda, 2 teaspoonfuls 
salt. Graham flour. Dissolve the soda in a little cold water, 
slightly warm the molasses, and add it to the soda. Stir the salt 
into the sponge, and beat well with a strong spoon ; then put in 
the molasses and soda, and when these have been thoroughly in- 
corporated by beating, add Graham flour until a very thick mix- 
ture is formed. This is not to be kneaded like other kinds of 
yeast bread, but it should be so thick with Graham as to be diffi- 
cult to stir. Beat the batter well for three or four minutes, turn 
it into two well-greased tins, and set in a warm place ; and 
when the loaves have risen to be half again their original size, 
bake for an hour in a rather slow oven. The bread will not rise 
as rapidly as that made of wheat flour, as it has more body to 
carry. It is mixed so soft that the dough takes the form of the 
pans in which it is baked. The success of Graham bread de- 
pends largely upon thorough beating. 






THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 117 

Rye or entire wheat may be used in place of Graham flour. 
Graham Bread No. 2. 

(Miss Carrie Parker.) 

One pint of warm milk, 1 teaspoonful salt, 2 tablespoonfuls 
sugar or molasses, % cake of compressed yeast, y z cup of warm 
water, i]/z cups of white flour, 3 cups of Graham flour. Proceed 
as in Graham bread No. I. 

Boston Brown Bread. 

(Mrs. A. G. Rogers.) 

One quart of Indian meal, 1 quart rye meal, 1 cup molasses, 1 
teaspoonful soda, salt to taste, \% quarts warm water. Bake or 
steam 5 hours — some people add raisins. 

Plain Rolls. 

One cup milk, scalded, 1 teaspoonful butter, 1 teaspoonful 
sugar, y z teaspoonful salt, % cake compressed yeast, %. cup 
warm water. Flour to stiffen. 

Melt the butter and dissolve the sugar and salt in the hot milk. 
Soak the yeast in the water ; when dissolved and the milk is 
cool, put all together, and add about one and one-quarter cups 
of flour, or enough to make a . thick batter. Beat thoroughly, 
cover the bowl with plate and a cloth and place in a pan of warm 
water. 

Let it rise about an hour, or until full of bubbles, then stir in 
flour enough to make a dough that can be shaped in the hand. 
Let it rise again, well covered, as before, and when it is light, 
cut it down. When it puffs up again turn it out onto the board, 
and knead it slightly. Pat it out a little with the rolling pin, 
and spread the surface with a tablespoonful of butter, softened. 
Fold it over toward the middle and knead it until no trace of 
the butter can be seen. 

Divide it into portions the size of a small egg, and roll them

PIES. 






(i No soil upon earth is so dear }o our eyes, 
As the soil we first stirred in terrestrial pies." 

O. W. HOLMES. 

"Do not tell your wife that your mother's pies were better 
than hers." 

Cottolene makes a lighter and more delicate pie-crust than 
lard, and there is none of the greasiness that always exists with 
lard while there is more of the shortening quality. Cottolene 
contains no salt. Always use a little in your pastry. Use % of 
the usual quantity of shortening when you use Cottolene. Use 
the Cottolene cold, and keep the pastry in a cold place. Having 
tried Cottolene, you will not want lard and very little butter for 
your pastry. If Cottolene or any shortening is distributed in 
layers throughout the pastry, without allowing a paste to be 
formed with the flour, it will be flaky. 

The compiler heartily recommends the use of this compound 
after two years of practical experience as being more healthful 
and economical than any other shortening. 

To prevent the juice of pies from soaking into the under crust, 
rub the crust, before filling the pies — with a cloth dipped in a 
well beaten egg. 



130 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

Pie Crust. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

One cupful Cottolene, 3 cupfuls of flour, a little salt. Sift the 
flour and the salt and rub in the shortening. Use enough ice 
water to hold all together, handling as little as possible, roll from 
you. One-third of the above quantity is enough for one pie. 

For Pastry. 

(Miss Nellie B. Hoyt.) 

One cupful of flour is sufficient for the crust of a medium-sized 
pie. To make tender and flaky pastry, always mix with a knife 
and roll from you, using lard, butter and water as cold as pos- 
sible. A marble or glass slab is excellent upon which to roll 
pastry. 

Common Pie Crust. 

(Mrs. S.) 

One cupful of lard, 1 cupful of butter, 5 cupsful of flour, y z a 
teaspoonful of baking powder, cut the lard and butter into the 
flour with a knife ; add just enough ice water to mix. Neither 
roll nor knead more than necessary. 

As Easy Way oi Making Light Pastry. 

(Sadie B.) 

Chop % of a cupful of butter into a cupful of sifted flour, with 
a pinch of salt. Mix with a few spoonfuls of ice water into a stiff 
paste. Roll out once or twice with a little more flour. 

Apple Pie. 

Six tart apples, l / 2 cupful sugar, yi lemon rind grated. Peel, 
core, and slice apples very thin ; line pie plate with paste ; put in 
apples, sugar, and a little water ; spice to taste, wet the edges 
with cold water ; wash with milk, bake in steady moderate oven 
25 minutes — or till apples are cooked. 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 131 

Blackberry or Huckleberry Pie. 

One-half cupful sugar, and 3 cupfuls berries to each pie. Line 
pie plate with paste, put in berries and sugar, wet the edge, cover 
and wash with milk ; bake in quick, steady oven 20 minutes 

Custard Pie. 

Four eggs, 1 quart of milk, a little salt, and y z cupful of sugar. 
Bake with under crust only. 

Gocoanut Pie. 

One grated cocoanut, 1 quart of milk heated to boiling and 
poured over the grated nut, 2 tablespoonfuls of butter, 4 eggs, 
sugar to taste. This makes two pies. 

Whipped Cream Pie. 

(" Grand-ma.") 

Line a deep pie tin with a moderately rich crust. Bake in a 
quick oven ; then spread it with any soft jam or jelly, and on this 
pour a teacup ful of cream, beaten or whipped to a stiff foam ; 
then sweeten and flavor to taste ; the cream will beat more easily 
if very cold at first. More jelly can be spread on the top of the 
cream, or serve it without, as preferred. 

Rhubard Pie. 

(L. S. P.) 

Cut up fine 2 cupfuls of tender rhubard, add % cupful of sugar 
and a rounded spoonful of flour ; stir all together and lay on an 
under crust, put a few pieces of butter on the top, grate over a 
little nutmeg, cover and bake half an hour, or till just cooked 
through. Prepared in this way the juice will not run out. 

Pineapple Pie.

Genuine Pumkin Pies. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

These shall really be pumkin, aud neither squash nor custard. 
The pumkin should be of dark yellow skin and heavy in propor- 
tion to its size ; the flesh thick and fine grained ; pare and cut 
in inch cubes and cook it in a little water until soft, being care- 
ful that it does not burn. Then press through a colander, put it 
back in the kettle with some molasses or sugar and spice, and 
let it mull away until it is a rich red amber marmalade. This 
must be done a day or two before the pies are made, for it is a 
work of time. One cupful of such pumkin is ample for a deep 
pie, and real pumkin pie is never baked in a shallow plate. A 
proportion for a pie is i cupful of pumkin, i egg, 3 to 4 cups of 
milk, l /z cupful of sugar, a little salt, J^ teaspoonful of ginger, % 
teaspoonful of cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Bake rather 
slowly. 

Summer Mince Pie.

One cup rasins chopped fine, 3 cups water, 3 cups sugar, y 2 cup 
vinegar, 1 nutmeg, 1 tablespoonful each of cinnamon, cloves, all- 
spice and ginger, butter size of an egg, 8 crackers rolled fine. 
Cook well before baking. This quantity makes four or five pies. 

Mince Meat. 

If the perfection of flavor is to be obtained, mince-meat should 
be made two, or better, three weeks before it will be needed. 
If made according to the following recipe, it will keep all Win- 
ter, and the quantity given will make a great many pies : 

Two pounds of beef, 2 pounds of suet, % pound of candied 
lemon peel, 2 pounds of layer raisins, 1 quart of sherry, 1 quart 
of good brandy, 2 oranges (juice and rind), 2 lemons (juice and 
rind), 2 tablespoon fulfs of salt, 4 pounds of apples, 2 pounds of

PUDDINGS and SAUCES. 



' ' Your dressing, da?icing, gadding, where is the good in ? 
Sweet lady, tell me, can you make a pudding f* ' 

Puddings are either baked, boiled or steamed ; rice, bread, 
custard and fruit puddings require moderate heat; batter and 
corn starch, a quick oven. Always bake them as soon as mixed. 
In making puddings, always beat the eggs separately, straining 
the yolks and adding the white the last thing. When fruit is 
used, roll it in flour and stir it in toward the last. Boiled pud- 
dings are lighter when boiled in a cloth, bring the cloth or pud- 
ding-bag out of hot water, flour the inside, pour in the pudding, 
tie securely and place in a kettle with a saucer in the bottom to 
prevent burning and pour in boiling water to cover the bag. 
Keep it boiling constantly, turning several times. It requires 
double the time to boil that it does to bake a pudding. Boiled 
puddings should be served as soon as done. Steaming is a safter 
method of cooking, as the pudding is sure to be light and whole- 
some. In making sauces, do not boil after the butter is added. 

Apple Dumplings. 

(Mrs. Keech.) 

Rub equal quantities of butter and lard and a little salt into 
flour, with yeast powder, as for biscuit, and stir through this the 
apples chopped fine. Make into balls and drop into boiling 
water. 



138 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK.

(Mrs. Chas. Merrill.) 

Three fourths pouiid of suet, chopped fine, i pound of sugar, 
i pound of grated stale bread, i pound of stoned raisins, i pound 
of currants, y 2 pint of milk and a gill of brandy, i nutmeg, y 2 
teaspoon of cinnamon, y teaspoon mace, the rind and juice of a 
lemon, i teaspoon salt and nine eggs. Mix all the ingredients 
except the eggs, which should be beaten until light and then 
added. Steam 5 hours. 

Mother's Suet Pudding. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

One cup chopped suit, : cup stoned raisins, ]/ 2 cup currents, 1 
cup molasses, 1 cup sour milk, 1 egg, 3 cups flour, salt and l / 2 tea- 
spoonful soda. All kinds of spices. Steam 3 hours. 

Blueberry Pudding. 

(Mrs. Wm. Merrill.) 

One cup sweet milk, 1 cup of molasses or sugar, flour enough 
to make a stiff batter for a spoon to stand in, 1 teaspoonful soda, 
just before putting in a quart of berries. Steam 3 hours. The 
success of the pudding is said to be in adding the soda the last 
thing. y z makes a large pudding. Eat with liquid or hard sauce. 

Snow Pudding. 

(Miss Helen L, Johnson,) 

Editor, Table Talk. 

Soak y z a box of gelatine in y 2 cup of cold water for y 2 an 
hour ; pour over it 1 pint of boiling water and then dissolve ; add 
% of a pound of granulated sugar, and x / 2 of a cup of lemon 
juice ; stir until the sugar is dissolved, strain into a basin. Stand 
when it is cold, not only until the liquid has cooled, but has be- 
gun to foam. It must be beaten until it is as white as snow be- 



THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 139 

fore the eggs are added. Beat the white of three eggs to a stiff 
white froth. Beat them into the mixture, and when thoroughly 
mixed snowy white and stiff, turn into a mold previously wet with 
cold water. The liquid settles because it is not beaten sufficient- 
ly, or is beaten before it begins to foam. It must be beaten stiff 
and foam before the eggs are added. Then there is no danger of 
their rising. 

Banana Pudding. 

(Miss Helen Johnson.) 
(Editor Table Talk.) 

Cut stale cake in thin slices and line a dish with the pieces. 
Cover the cake with bananas sliced very thin. Pour over this a

Stir well, add the suet powdered and the salt. When this mix- 
ture is cold put with it the eggs beaten light, the molasses and 
the spices, and beat all hard. Turn into a well greased mold and 
steam for three hours. Eat with hard sauce. This quantity will 
serve eight or ten persons.

DESSERTS AND FANCY 
DISHES. 



" To be good, be usejul. To le useful, be always making some 
thing good. ' ' 

Desserts were never more delicious, more easily prepared, or 
more to the taste of the epicure than they are to-day. 

To many people, the dessert of desserts is figs ; one fig and a 
slice of caramel or pound cake ; the second choice is a brandy- 
fig with cream sponge cake ; cherries with walnut cake is an- 
other delicate finish for a nice dinner, and brandy cherries with 
angel cake will be found equally choice. 

A saucerful of whipped cream made very sweet and decorated 
with an edging of big, ripe strawberries is good to eat and pretty 
to look at. The same cream moulded in a wine glass, turned out on 
a plate and encircled with tart cranberry jelly is a dainty dessert. 

Shaddock Sherbert.

orange spoon, take out the pulp. Put 2 x /i cups of sugar over the 
fire with 1 cup of water ; stir until the sugar is dissolved ; boil 
until the sirup spins a thread. Cover 2 tablespoon fuls of gelatine 
with % a cup of cold water and let stand for % hour. Dissolve 
over hot water. Add the hot sirup to the shaddock pulp with the 
gelatine. Let cool, press through a sieve and freeze. 

Orange Sherbert. 

(Mrs. M. C. Currier.) 

Six juicy oranges. After pressing out the juice put water on 
pulp to get out remaining juice, if oranges are sweet add juice 
of 2 or 3 lemons, sweeten, and just before freezing, add 1 pint of 
good cream. Add water sufficient to make y 2 gallon. 

Tutti Frutti. 

(Harriman Cook-Book.) 

Sweeten and flavor 1 gallon rich cream ; when partly frozen, 
stir in 1 can pineapple, citron, raisins, figs, candies and freeze. 

Spanish Cream. 

(Mrs. James Campbell.) 

One pint milk, y 2 package of gelatine soaked y 2 an hour in the 
milk, then put in a kettle and stir till all is dissolved and the 
milk reaches the boiling point. Beat the yolks of 3 eggs with 1 
cup of sugar, and stir into the hot milk. Then remove from the 
fire and stir in the beaten whites of the eggs, flavor with vanilla. 
Beat well, then pour into a dish and set on the ice. 

Apple Float. 

(Mrs. Wm. Merrill.) 

One pint sifted apple sauce, 1 quart rich milk or cream. 
Sweeten and flavor to taste. Add the whites of 2 eggs and 
freeze.

Peach Glace Meringue. 

(Miss Helen L. Johnson.) 

Editor Table Talk.) 

[Copyrighted.] 

Scald 1 cup of cream, add \% cups of sugar. Stir until the 

sugar is dissolved and cook until the cream looks blue — about 

five minutes. Take from the fire, add 1 cup of uncooked cream, 

and, when cold, 1 teaspoonful of vanilla, and freeze. Peel 1 

quart of peaches, cut in pieces and press through sieve. When 

the cream is frozen, add the peaches ; turn the dasher rapidly 

until they are well stirred in. Remove the dasher. Stir down 

the ice cream ; cover and pack. Let stand two hours to ripen 

before filling meringue shells. 

Tapioca Cream. 

(Mrs. Iv. P. Hosford.) 

Two tablespoonfuls tapioca soaked over night. Heat 1 pint 
of milk to boiling. Stir in the tapioca and let it cook a few min- 
utes. Add the yolks of 2 eggs, salt, y z cup sugar, cook a little 
and when taken off the range stir in the whites beaten to a stiff 
froth. Flavor to taste. 

Shredded Pineapples. 

(Miss Elizabeth C. Hills.) 

Select a ripe, juicy pineapple, remove every bit of the skin and 
all the " eyes." Then lay the fruit on a platter, hold it firmly 
with the left hand, and with a silver fork tear off the pineapple 
in small pieces, leaving the core whole. Put the shredded fruit 
in a serving dish, sprinkle generously with fine granulated sugar, 
cover, and let stand in the ice chest an hour, if possible, before 
serving. This method of preparing it draws out the juice and 
flavor better than slicing, and makes the fruit seem much more 
tender.

(Miss Hattie Barnes.) 
Soak % box gelatine in % cup cold water. Line a pint mold 
with lady fingers. Chill and whip i pint cream. Set bowl in ice 
water. Sift over the whipped cream % cup powdered sugar, add

Ice Cream. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 
For 4 quarts cream when frozen, 2 quarts milk, 1 quart cream, 
1 pound pulverized sugar, l / 2 box gelatine. Dissolve the gelatine 
into the warm milk, add sugar, lastly the cream, flavor to taste ; 
if vanilla is used, 3 teaspoonfuls are sufficient. Do not cook it, 
but freeze at once. Freeze sufficiently hard to be easily dipped 
with a spoon from the freezer to the packing can, for if it is 
frozen too hard, the cream becomes as butter. The ice and salt 
hi the packing tub, around the can will complete the work. 
Fruit of any kind may be added. 

Pistachio Ice Cream. 

(Mrs. E. J. Shephard.) 
Blanch 3 ounces of pistachio nuts and chop them very fine. If 
they seem dry cover with 1 tablespoon ful of sherry or a few 
drops of rose water and let stand for some time Scald 1 pint of

ful Bakei 's extract of lemon. 2 teaspoonful Baker's extract of 
orange. Dissolve the sugar in the water, add the orange juice 
and flavoring extracts, and freeze. 

Cherry Water Ice. 

(Mrs. Stephen Rider.) 

Stone 1 pound of cherries ; put 1 pound of sugar, with 1 pint of 
water, in a saucepan over the fire ; stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved and boil for 10 minutes. Pour it over the cherries and let 
stand until cooled, then squeeze through a bag. When all the 
juice is extracted, color a delicate lavender and flavor with two 
drops of nectarine extract, and freeze. 

Sliced Oranges.

Cut the bananas into small slices, and over this pour cream 
beaten to a stiff froth. Do not sweeten the cream until after it is 
whipped, and then use powdered sugar. Flavor with sherry or 
brandy.

CAKES. 



11 With weights and measures just and true, 

Oven of even heat, 
Well hitter ed tins and quiet nerves 

Success will be complete. ' ' 

Successful cakermaking depends on proper materials ; a cor- 
rect recipe; following directions explicitly; accurate weights 
and measurements ; compounding the ingredients in their proper 
order ; regulating the temperature of the oven according to the 
kind of cake made ; sifting the baking powder and flour to- 
gether two or three times ; placing in the oven as soon as the bak- 
ing powder is added ; greasing the tin with Cottolene rather than 
butter, and sifting a little dry flour over ; opening and shutting 
the oven door very gently during the process of baking ; not 
turning while in the oven if it can be avoided ; keeping fruit over 
night in a warm room, dredging it thoroughly with flour, and 
stirring it in lightly the last thing ; lining tins for loaf-cake with 
oiled paper. 

To cream the butter, if it be hard, pour boiling water into the 
bowl, let it stand a minute, empty, wipe the bowl dry, and put in 
the butter ; work with a heavy spoon until soft, then beat it to a 
cream; add the sugar next and beat until* white and creamy ; 
add the well beaten yolks of the eggs, and the milk or water 
next, a little at a time, beating well, add part of the flour and 
beat from three tj five minutes ; last add the flour that contains 



154 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

the baking powder and the whites at the same time. Whip them 
lightly and quickly in ; do not beat a moment after they are 
whipped in. Never stir a cake ; hold the bowl in a slanting 
position, and whip with a circular motion upward, carrying the 
spoon out of the batter each time ; this incorporates more air 
than by the stirring method, and yields a fine-grained, light, and 
tender cake even with much less butter than when carelessly 
made. In using Cottolene which is the best shortening, put a 
pinch of salt in the flour. 

Always flavor a cake. 

Sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like pound cake. Sour 
milk makes spongy light cake. Do not use both in the same 
cake. 

For rich cakes use powdered sugar. For plain cakes granla- 
ted sugar. For fine cakes,, beat the yolks and whites of eggs 
separately. For plain cakes, beat both together thoroughly. 
Use of Cottelene two-thirds of the usual quantity of shortening. 

In baking loaf cake remember that unless you place a piece of 
paper over for protection at first, a top crust will be formed at 
once that prevents the raising. When cake is well raised re- 
move paper for browning on top. 

Set a dish of water in the oven with cake when baking and it 
will seldom scorch. 

Two apples kept in the cake box will keep moderately rich 
cake moist for a length of time, if the apples are renewed when 
withered. 

Angel Cake. 

Whites of ii eggs, x / z cup granulated sugar sifted once, i cup 
flour sifted with i teaspoonful cream of tartar 4 times, 1 teaspoon- 
ful vanilla. Bake in an ungreased pan 40 minutes. When done 
invert pan on two cups and let stand until cake is cold.

[Miss Helen L. Johnson says in Table Talk.] 

The various icings used by the pastry cook and confectioner 
are compounded in a different way from the numerous home 
icings, the latter, being as a general rule, preferable. Confec- 
tioners usually put on several coatings of icings, allowing each 
to dry before adding the next. The first is what is called the 
rough coat and is used to set the crumbs so that they may not 
show through the surface of the finished cake. 

Transparent Icing. 

(Miss Helen ly. Johnson.) 

Dissolve 1%, cups of granulated sugar in % cup of water. Let 
it boil without stirring until it forms a ball when picked up in 
the forefinger. Take from the fire and beat until it becomes a 
little cloudy. Put in the farina boiler and melt ; let cool until, 
when poured on the cake, it will form, or if the cakes are small 
they can be dipped in it. 

Confectioner's Icing. 

The whites of 2 eggs, the same quantity of water ; stir very 
thick with confectioner's sugar and flavor to suit fancy. Many 
use water without the eggs, but the sugar must be the specia 1 
kind called XXX. 



160 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

For pink icing, add a few drops of cochineal or beet juice to 
any white icing. Yellow may be made by using a spoonful of 
saffron water or two or three drops of butter color, or, betterl 
still, simply beat the yolks quite stiff with the sugar. If green 
is desired, use a little spinach juice. Brown is made with cocoa 
or chocolate. 

Delicate Icing. 

One cup of sugar, 3 spoonfuls of water; boil until it ropes, then 
pour slowly over the stiffly beaten whites of 2 eggs, stirring all 
the time. Flavor with almond or rose, spread while warm. Add 
cocoanut if desired.

Boil until cooked sufficiently to harden, then put on the cake — 
flavor with vanilla. 

Caramel Frosting. 

(H. S. B.) 

Two-thirds cup milk, butter size of walnut, 2 cups sugar. Boil 
10 minutes, flavor with vanilla, beat till cold. 

Icing That Will not Crack. 

Icing for cakes may be prevented from cracking when being 
cut by adding 1 teaspoonful of sweet cream to each unbeaten 
egg ; beat all together and add sugar until as stiff as can be 
stirred.

Strawberry Preserves. 

(Miss Helen Iy. Johnson.) 
[Editor Table Talk.] 
Add 1 cup of boiling water to 2 pounds of granulated sugar, and 
stir over hot water until the sugar is dissolved. Put the kettle 
over the fire, add 2 pounds of strawberries, and simmer gently for 
10 minutes, 5 minutes longer if the fruit does not look clear. 
Skim out the fruit very gently, lay on platters and put in the hot 
sun while the syrup is being boiled down. Boil the syrup until it 
is thick and rich, strain off any thin syrup caused by the stand- 
ing of the berries in the sun, and add the berries to the thick 
syrup. Fill the cans and screw down the tops immediately. 

Hodge Podge.

368 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

slowly over a moderate fire until the sugar has penetrated the 
fruit. Lifting each tomato carefully with a spoon, spread them 
on dishes and stand them in the sun i or 2 days to dry, sprinkling 
with granulated sugar several times during the drying. When 
perfectly dry pack in jars, with layers of sugar. Do not allow 
any moisture to fall on the fruit while drying. 
Grape Jelly. 
(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

The grapes should be used before they get ripe, when they are 
just turning ; stem and slightly cook them ; then strain through 
a jelly bag, place the liquid again in the preserving kettle and 
allow it to come slowly to the boiling point ; let it boil for 15 
minutes, meanwhile skimming it with care ; to every pint of juice 
now add 1 pound of granulated sugar which has been previously 
warmed in shallow pans but not allowed to melt ; let the mixture 
boil 5 minutes and then pour into jelly glasses and set it away to 
cool. 

Crabapple and currant jelly is made in the same way.

CANDIES. 



" Holdfast that which is good." 

Granulated sugar is preferable. Candy should not be stirred 
while boiling. Cream tartar should not be added until syrup 
begins to boil. Butter should be put in when candy is almost 
done. Flavors are more delicate when not boiled in candy, but 
added afterward. 

Never, when pouring out candy, scrape the saucepan over it,, 
or allow any of the scrapings of the saucepan to fall into it. 
Always use a thick saucepan, in which to boil sugar. 

French Candy. 

(Mrs. Keech.) 

Two and one-half pounds confectioner's sugar (4x), 1 pint 
grated cocoanut, white of 1 egg mixed in 1 tablespoonful cold 
water and a little flavoring. Knead like dough. Make out and 
mix with nuts. 

Cream Candy. 

(Mrs. J. F. Bancroft.) 

One pound of sugar, 1 tablespoonful of vinegar, 1 cup of water. 
Flavor with vanilla ; stir very little. When the candy stiffens by 
dropping a few drops in cold water, it is done. Pull until it 
grows white. 



172 THE UNIVERSAL COOK-BOOK. 

Candied Pop-Corn. 

(Mrs. C. W. F.) 

Put into an iron kettle i tablespoonful batter, 3 tablespoonfuls 
water, r teacupful white pulverized sugar. Boil until ready to 
candy, then throw in 3 quarts of nicely popped corn. Stir briskly 
till candy is evenly distributed over corn. Take kettle from fire, 
stir until it is cooled a little and you have each grain separate 
and crystallized with sugar, taking care that corn does not burn. 
Nuts of any kind prepared in same way. 

Efferton Taffy. 

(Mrs. A. G. Rogers.) 

This is a favorite English confection. To make it, take 3 
pounds of the best brown sugar and boil with i}£ pints of water, 
until the candy hardens in cold water. Then add y 2 pound of 
sweet flavored fresh butter, which will soften the candy. Boil a 
few minutes until it again hardens and pour it into trays. Flavor 
with lemon if desired. 

Peppermint. 

(Mrs. James Campbell.) 

Two cups granulated sugar, y z cup of cold water. Let it boil 
three minutes. Beat in 6 tablespoonfuls of pulverized sugar, 
scant y 2 teaspoonful of cream of tartar, 10 drops peppermint. 
Drop it with a teaspoon. 

Caramels. 

(E. J. F.) 

Three pounds brown sugar, 1 cake chocolate, 1 cup milk, 1 cup

MISCELLANEOUS 



" Last but not least. ." 

To Prepare Curry Powder. 

One ounce ginger, 1 ounce mustard, 1 ounce pepper, 3 of cori- 
ander seed, 3 of turmeric, % ounce cardamons, % ounce cay- 
enne pepper, % ounce cinnamon, and %. ounce cumin seed. 
Pound fine, sift and cork tight in bottle. 

Washing Fluid.

borax, 1 ounce ammonia, 4 quarts boiling water. Make in a tin 
or wooden bucket and bottle when cool. Use 1 teacupful to 3 
pails of water, and a very little soap. 

To Wash Blankets. 

(Mrs. Gwathmey.) 

Seven gallons water in boiler, ]/ z pound ivory soap dissolved in 
water. Add 2 tablespoonfuls kerosene oil. Let steam but not 
boil ; rinse in two waters having the water warm ; wring dry, 
shake well, hang in hot sun. This recipe will wash two large 
blankets. Keep in boiler about %. hour, constantly stirring with 
a stick. No rubbing is necessary. Two grains of pulverized 
burnt alum added to 1 gallon of water, will cause turbid water to 
be as clear as well water.

To Clarify Grease, 

To clarify grease of any kind, cut a potato in slices, drop into 
the hot grease, fry a dark brown and your fat is pure and clean 
for cooking. 

Brown Bread. 

(Miss Adelaide Payne.) 

(School Cookery.) 

One cup of yellow Indian meal ; 1 cup of Graham flour ; 1 cup 
of sour milk ; 2 cups of sweet milk ; y z a cup of molasses ; 1 tea- 
spoonful of soda ; 1 scant teaspoonful of salt. Sift the Graham, 
then mix it with the Indian and rye. Stir the soda in the sour 
milk until thoroughly dissolved ; add the salt, sweet milk, mo- 
lasses and stir all into the dry mixture, beating until perfectly 
smooth. Grease your brown bread mold or tin, cover tightly and 
steam for five hours. If a hard crust is desired, steam four 
hours, then put in the oven for one hour. 

Lemon Cream. 

(Miss Adelaide Payne.) 

(School Cookery.) 

Four eggs ; 6 tablespoonfuls of sugar ; the grated rind of 1 
lemon and 4 tablespoonfuls of lemon juice ; 2 tablespoonfuls of 
hot water. Separate the yolks of the eggs from the whites. Beat 
the yolks light ; then add 4 tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar, 
the lemon juice and rind. Stir well; then add the hot water, 
mixing all well together. Cook this mixture in a double boiler 
until it thickens, stirring all the time. Beat the whites of the 
eggs to a stiff froth and add 2 tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, 
cutting it in. Remove the yolk mixture from the fire and cut in 
gently the whites, folding and cutting in, until the two are well 
mixed. Turn into a glass dish and serve very cold, 
use less lemon juice.

Points About Salt. 

Ink stains can be entirely removed by the immediate applica- 
tion of dry salt before the ink has dried. When the salt has 
become discolored by absorbing the ink, brush it off and apply 
more, wetting it slightly. Continue this until the ink is all re- 
moved. — Dampened salt will remove the discoloration of cups 
and saucers caused by tea and careless washing. — New calicoes 
and stockings should be allowed to lie in salt water for an hour 
before the the first wash, to set the colors. — To cool a hot dish 
quickly, set it in a pan full of cold salt water, which will cool it 
more rapidly than water free from salt. — A teaspoonful of salt in 
each kerosene lamp makes the oil give a clearer and much better 
light and it is claimed saves the oil as well. — Willow-ware can 
best be cleaned by a solution of salt and water. — To clean door 
matting, wash it with weak salt and water, and dry it well. — Salt 
dissolved in alcohol is often good for removing grease spots from 
cloth. — Salt will curdle new milk ; so in preparing custard and 
porridges, salt should not be added until the last thing. — If your 
coal fire is low, throw on a tablespoonful of salt and it will help 
it very much. — -.To make whites of eggs beat quickly, put in a 
pinch of salt. 

Hop Tea. 

A large spoonful of hops, simmer in a pint of water. When 
strong enough, strain off and add white sugar. A. quieting drink, 
excellent for nervous headache. 

Polish for Old Furniture. 

Alcohol Yz pint, shellac and rosin each % ounce ; after these 
have dissolved in the alcohol, add ]/ 2 pint linseed oil ; shake 
well. Apply with a sponge or brush, or canton flannel, rubbing 
it well after the application, which gives a nice polish. 

t To Remove Tar. 

Rub well with lard. Afterwards wash in warm water and soap #
