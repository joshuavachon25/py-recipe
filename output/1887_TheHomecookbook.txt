The COOK'S FRIEXD is also useful in PIE CRUST, 
BOILED PUDDINGS, *&c., saving a large proportion of the 
usual SHORTENING, and producing more healthy food. 

IT CONTAINS NO INJURIOUS INGREDIENIS 

Such as are to be found in many of the baking powders that are 
being forced on public attention, its principal constituent being 
the purest Grape Cream Tartar that money can buy. 

Dyspeptics may use with auvantage food prepared by its aid. 

Wherever receipts call for one teaspoonf ul of soda and two of 
Cream of Tartar, two and one half teaspoonfuls of Cook's 
Fkibnd will be found to do the work in a superior manuer.

HOUSEKEEPING. 



Word of grace to -woman ; word that makes her the 
earthly providence of her family, that wins gi-atitude and 
attachment from those at home, and a good report of 
those that are without. Success in housekeeping adds 
credit to the woman of intellect, and lustre to a woman's 
accomplishments. It is a knowledge which it is as dis- 
creditable for any woman to be without as for man not 
to know how to make a living, or how to defend himself 
when attacked. He may be ever so good an artist, ever 
so polished a gentleman ; if deficient in these points of 
self-preservation you set him down for a weakling, and 
his real weight in society goes for very little. So, no 
matter how talented a woman may be, or how useful in 
the church or society, if she is an indifferent house- 
keeper it is fatal to her influence a foil to her brilliancy 
and a blemish in her garments 



10 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

Housekeeping ought not to be taught in classes and by 
professors ; though when early training is lacking they 
may be of use. It is one of those things to be imbibed 
without effort in girlhood, instead of being taken up at 
marriage and experimented on with varying certainty for 
the rest of one's natural life. There is no earthly reason 
why girls, from eight to eighteen, should not learn and 
practise the whole round of housekeeping, from the first 
beating of eggs to laying carpets and presiding at a din- 
ner party, at the same time that they go on with music, 
languages and philosophy. The lessons would be all the 
better learned if, instead of sitting down at once out of 
school hours, the girl was taught" to take pride in keeping 
her room nice, or in helping about such work as canning 
fruit for the season, hanging clean curtains, or dusting 
every day. The wealthiest women of the oldest families 
in society are not above seeing to these things themselves, 
and they know how it should be done. They were bred 
to it as part of a lady's duty. But if a woman finds her- 
self ignorant or half-taught how to keep house, there is 
nothing so difficult to learn that she may not be proficient in 
in a year or two at most. An intelligent woman will suc- 
ceed in most duties at first trying. Housekeeping is an 
exact science, and works like the multiplication table if 
one only has learned it. But if one is shaky in figures 
how is he ever to keep accounts 1 There is no chance 
about housekeeping. If Mrs. Smith's sitting room is 
always neat and fresh, it is because she sweeps it with tea 
leaves, and sponges the carpet with ox gall, and dusts it 
with a damp cloth, and keeps a door mat on the porch, 
§lid seQds the boys b^ck every tin)P tpuaeit till tbe^ get the 



HOUSEKEEPENG. 1 1 

habit of keeping clean. VViiiie you hang a newspaper 
before the what-not and throw one over the work table, 
sweep with a soft broom, putting the broad side of it at 
every stroke against the moulding ; instead of carrying 
all the dust clean from the crevice next the wall, by one 
lengthwise sweep with the corner of the broom, you 
blow the dust off some places and give a hasty rub at 
others; pass the stove with a touch from the hearth 
brush instead of blacking it, and let the boys track in 
mud and dust enough to deface a new carpet in its first 
season, while you take it out in scolding — which was 
never known to brighten rooms yet. So, when your 
feather cake fails, though you made it precisely by the 
rule which the other day came out like bleached sponge, 
there is a very good reason for it, you did not stir it as 
much as the fii-st time, or you beat it a little too long and 
lost the best effervescence of your soda, or your baking 
powder had been left open a few minutes at a time on 
baking days and lost strength. By practising the same 
recipe carefully, all these and other points fix themselves 
in vour mind, so that success is certain. Those clever 
cooks, whose success is so much a matter of instinct, 
observe all these points unconsciously each time, and 
lay it to luck ? There's no such word in housekeeping. 
This labour does not only mean keeping things clean, 
and having plenty to eat. It goes from the outside of 
the house to the inside of the travelling-bags of those 
who leave it. The mistress must observe the outside of 
her house regularly ; on Saturday is the most convenient 
time to see if window-blinds need washing, if the catches 
ftre in repair, if the shades inside hang straight, and the 



12 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

curtains drape well, if the walk, steps, and piazzas are 
neat, and the door knobs and paint in order, making a 
note of every want, and having it attended to at once. 
Dexterity with tools is very convenient to any one and I 
have known accomplished women who would set a pane 
of glass, put on a door knob, and hang a gate in the best 
style. One of the valued contributors to the New York 
press is a woman who reads Horace in Latin, and 
Bastiat's political economy, makes point-lace and em- 
broiders beautifully, who at the gold mines with her 
husband built the chimney to her house, and finished 
most of the interior with her own hands. A little care, 
weekly, keeps a place in that bright order that so attracts 
and welcomes one at sight. It looks as if whole people 
lived in it, with live sensibilities and intelligence. In- 
doors the same spirit is reflected. The bell-pull never is 
left for weeks after it gets loose, the gas burners are never 
sufiered to leak, or grow dim; the kerosene lamps are 
large enough to give good light, and of the best pattern 
for safety, and for the eye. The stoves are the open 
"Fireside" kind — the modern version of the old Franklin 
stoves — giving the ventilation and delight of an open fire, 
burning either coal or wood, with bars and fender like a 
grate; yet, capable of being shut up as tightly as any 
base-burning heater by two tight fitting covers that may 
be removed and put away at pleasure. The health, the 
comfort, the luxury of such an addition makes up for 
many a deficiency beside. The carpet was well-chosen 
at first in small figures and warm colours of good quality, 
whether Brussels or three-ply, and it looks well as long 
fts it lasts, and kept clean by shaking twice a year. 



HOUSEKEEPING, 1 3 

laid straight and stretched smooth over a soft lin i ng, 
which saves the carpet and saves noise; darned at 
the first break with wool matching the pattern, it will 
not be shabby in ten years. It is pleasant to have 
things last with the family, and grow to seem a part 
of it. The true sentiment of the sharp, genteel woman 
was expressed by the housekeeper who "liked to 
have her carpets wear out so she could have new 
ones." She let lodgings to have company, and money 
to dress with ? against her husband's wish, and her only 
dread was that of " settling down and having a lot of 
children with no theatres, no opera, nobody to see." 
The home feeling, the attachment that grows for the 
pleasant, enduring objects of daily use is one of the 
rare plants of sentiment that the housekeeper does well 
to cherish. There should be care at first to have things 
agreeable and handsome as possible, that they need not 
be a daily eyesore, and there need be no reason for wish- 
ing them to wear out. Manufactures constantly add 
service to trade by placing better patterns in reach of 
moderate purses. Thus, the mottled carpets in oak and 
brown, ash and crimson, maroon and elm-leaf yellow, 
with borders to match, so admired in velvet and Brus- 
sels, are found in fine three-plys and ingrain, and in the 
newer Venetians of hemp and wool, like the old-fashion- 
ed stair carpet that lasts so long. A word for these new 
Venetians, which is, on account of their artistic quality, 
likely to be overlooked, because they are so cheap. All 
the best colours and patterns of Brussels, in two sliades, 
in mottled, moss or leaf designs, are afforded in thia 
•urpet, which is as dui-able as the conscience of a house- 



14 THIS. HOME COOK BOOK. 

keeper could exact. Two rules are enough foi fche looks 
of a carpet ; clioose small figures and avoid contrasts of 
colour. Small figures, however, have different mean- 
ings to different people. As a rule, a small figure is not 
more than three inches at most, any way across. Very, 
very few rooms there are, but look better with cai*pet8 
of small design. Then the oil-cloth under the stove 
must match, if possible, and be bound with leather 
strips to keep the edge from getting unsightly. The 
woodbox or basket is covered with wool work or canvas, 
or applique of bright cloth on Turkish towelling, making 
a handsome bit of furniture. A scrap basket, with ap- 
plique border, and a bright lining, goes far toward keep- 
ing a room tidy. The mistress will try to have her 
rooms in keeping with the style by a few pieces of furni- 
ture in the fashion of the day, a Turkish chair embroid- 
ered in wools, a straight-backed one in unbleached 
towelling and applique of crimson, blue, black and gold, 
a stand covered with velvet, or a home-made easel with 
the single good picture the house afibrds on it, a jar- 
diniere of titles or wickerwork in the window, or a 
bamboo lounge, things not expensive in themselves, yet 
lending a graceful air to quiet surroundings. As for 
chairs, sofas and lambrequins, artists have been insist- 
ing on chintz for the last ten years, and women have as 
steadily bought woollen rep, which the doctors tell u? 
harbours dust, absorbs vitiated matter from the air, and 
is absolutely dangerous in disease from the contagion it 
holds. But women of the best taste, who like to have 
their rooms pretty, will choose chintz, when they can- 
not afibrd silk and satin, and often when they can, foi 
Its intrinsic beauty. 



HOUSEKEEPINa. 15 

It is of more account to have broad seats and deep 
cushions to chairs and sofas, than to have them covered 
with rich material. See that there are plenty of low seats 
in your sitting-room — for much of the furniture seen is of 
very little use for rest and ease — points essential to the 
health and comfort of women and children. If a woman 
wilL only start with the intention of making her house 
comfortable, she will gain all the admiration she wants. 
There are many elegant rooms in private houses, where 
there are only one or two that come up to the idea of com- 
fort. Now that is a very important word, one that cannot 
be infringed on without losing health. The mistress of a 
house must see that it is ventilated from top to bottom, 
by having every window and the skylight, if there is one, 
open at least once a day — if possible when the sun is shin- 
ing. She is responsible for the health of the household, 
and must allow no scent of decay, whether from ve^ables 
or meaty barrels or refuse in the cellar, no slops anywhere 
about the premises, no mouldering food in closets, no con- 
fined bedrooms or closets with old clothes or soiled linen 
to taint the air, no dead, musty smell in iiny room, how- 
ever seldom used, no sickly smell escaping from rooms 
where there is illness. She must see that fires are started 
as early in the fall and kept as late in the spring as the 
weakest, chilliest of her family desires, for these slow 
chilly days take more life, and play more mischief with 
nerves and blood than she could bear to think of, could she 
see their efiects. She must look after the clothing from a 
hygienic view, to see that her children and family are 
warm enough and cool enough, so w.arding off many an 
attack of cramps, coughs and neuralgia. The food must 



16 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

be of the best quality and she must know that it is. It 
pays to give an extra shilling on the half barrel for select- 
ed potatoes and apples, as they go farther and make more 
muscle than poor ones, and don't poison anybody. Sharp 
scrutiny of eggs, meat, butter, and milk, is a benefit to 
others as well as her own family, by raising the standard 
of provisions, besides it is a direct gain. More disease 
comes into the world in the shape of tainted butter and 
milk, than any one dreams of but the doctors. If she gets 
the hygienic craze about food, don't let her carry it to the 
verge of confounding things " healthful " with things im- 
eatable, for badly cooked oatmeal and graham " gems " 
are as distressing to delicate organisms as the richest 
mince pie and old cheese together. That slight sour tinge, 
which nobody noticed, in the home-made bread, that solid 
pudding, which yet was not quite rejected at dessert, are 
responsible for the bad breath of the children and the be- 
gining of a sick headache in their elders. Never be sat- 
isfied with any but the nicest cooking, with variety 
enough to make your table a delight as well as a necessity. 
And don't let anybody lay it to you that you are pam- 
pering your family, and devoting yourself to a low 
sphere of action. You are doing no such thing, but are 
giving them strong, active bodies, steady nerves and tem- 
pers, and clear brains to meet their work with. By just 
so much as you neglect your part of the work, they will 
fail in theirs. You are the engineer to feed the fires, and 
keep the wheels oiled, and the whole family system 
depends on you. Don't dare to call such work low. 
There is a great work to be done in Canadian kitchens. 
You may and ought to delegate as much to hired helpers 



HOUSEKEEPING. 17 

as you can, but you must see that all is done as it should 
be. And one receipt for training service is given, that is 
the whole secret in a nut-shell. If child or servant leaves 
anything undone, or ill-done, don't scold, but insist on 
having it done immediately as it ought to be. Put the 
badly ironed shirts in the basket to be done over, have 
the house-girl who left the china badly washed, take it 
out of the closet and do it right, time after time, and let 
her get tired of doing her work over, before j^ou get tired 
of telling her. It is no harder to do work nicely than 
to half do it, indeed the careless way is the hardeot. 
Finally, let your housekeeping be as liberal as you can. 
Whether well-io-do, or in narrow circumstances, you will 
hold that waste is a sin, against yourself and the world. 
By keeping strict account of every cent received and paid 
out, you can gauge your means, laying by what is proper, 
but within that limit be good to yourself and yours. Make 
the most of your money. It was no less a divine than 
the orthodox Doctor John Hall, who said that, of the 
two faults, he had far rather see people extravagant 
than penurious. Stint nowhere in cleanliness, light, antl 
warmth, and let what you have be the best and prettiest 
for the cost. By these things men live, in body at least, 
and the soul is very dependent on its surroundings, or 
at any rate greatly assisted by favourable ones. It is an 
every-day wonder to see how little rich people get for theii 
money ; the common-place houses, with so little that i.s 
light or striking or original in them, the dull service, the 
narrow round of enjoyments. In some sense housekeep- 
ing is making the most of life, bringing taste and variety 
Into it, compassing difficult ends with invention. Those 



18 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

who disdain it lower themselves. Never think that any- 
thing is too good for you or yours that you can obtain. 
Everywhere there are people living in small common ways 
because they are absolutely afraid of the expense or the 
notice which a pleasanter life would bring. Half the 
niceities of life involve only care to secure thein, without 
a dollar of expense. Good manners cost nothing, good 
taste is saving, and good housekeeping actually makes 
money. Though this book is an aid to the ambitious 
housekeeper in one direction only, that is, on the way to 
all the rest. People grow refined first in their eating. 
How is it, that the most brilliant and cleverest nation in 
the world has also the best cooking ? Put these things 
together, and do your best accnrdinp to their result 



TABLE TALK. 



In all attempts at refinement — one cardinal point 
should be kept in view — that manners were made for 
men, not men for manners. Nice customs, courtesy to 
great kings, and the greatest of these is convenience. 
Most rules will be found to serve convenience, and there 
is no good breeding where etiquette is not observed for 
t his end, the order and comfort of all concerned, not for 
the sake of defining one's social position. When any 
one begins to study manners as a set of arbitrary rules to 
be followed, because every other desirable acquaintance 
does the same, politeness breeds a sort of pharisaism 
that the best bred persons look down on as supremely 
vulgar. If any mistress of a house looks here for rules, 
that will aid her to afiect a trifle more of style than her 
neighbours, she will only be disappointed. If any 
woman wishes hints how to reduce her household to 
regularity, and make her children neat and gentle in 
habits, it may be that she will not find this chapter in 
vain. 

Martinet regularity as to hours and minutes is no 
longer held the saving virtue in a household. The rule

20 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

for dinner parties takes the sensible course of sitting 
down to table when the hour comes, and the principal 
part of those expected. No guest should feel affronted, 
if he is late, and finds the party at dinner, provided the 
indispensable care has been shown to keep his portion 
warm over dishes of hot water, by which they neither 
grow cold or are dried up in the oven. Order the table 
daily with the same care as for a dinner party. This 
is the only way to insure success for hostess and ser- 
vants, when one does come off, and gives mistress and 
waiter the luxury of getting used to nice style, so that 
it is just as easy as common ways, and no sudden vis- 
itor can put them out. Home tables do not always 
compare to advantage with those at the restaurant or 
club, and the housemother should see that a man finds 
as careful service at home as he does anywhere else. 
Unlimited laundry work should be one of the indul- 
gences of one's own house, and it should be of the ut- 
most nicety. Why should it be too much to provide 
clean napkins and table-cloth daily at home as well as 
at a hotel ? They would cost half an hour's extra work 
a day, and this is not too much for the refinement it 
gives. We should then expect to see the table spread 
with a snowy cloth, less starched than many house- 
keepers think necessary, finish and pliancy given by 
plenty of wax in the starch, which will keep it clean the 
longer. It should fall below the table half a yard all 
round, and be pinned up at the corners to keep it from 
the floor if necessary. For ceremonious occasions, a 
common white cloth is laid under the table-cloth to 
protect a handsome?if table keeps the upper cloth from

wearing, and because dishes make less noise when set 
down on it. 

For breakfast, the coffee is set before the mistress, the 
cups and spoons ranged in their saucers in front of it, in 
two rows if there are many of them ; the meat and 
plates, which should be warm, before the master ; salt, 
butter and castor at the corner to the right of both, 
head and foot, if the table is a large one, when two sets 
of these things will be convenient. Otherwise put them 
in the centre with the dishes in regular order around 
them, and relishes at the comers. To meet this order, 
it is a trifle to bave dishes in pairs of the same size, and 
use them always together for different things. Fruit, 
whether berries, baked apples, or pears, is served firet 
at breakfast, then oatmeal or wheaten grits, now found 
on every good table in cities at least, then meats and 
vegetables, with toast, hot cakes and coffee following. 
Hot rolls come wrapped in a napkin to keep them warm, 
griddle-cakes between two hot plates, and all meats 
covered. Baked potatoes are scrubbed with a manilla 
brush, the ends cut off, rinsed twice, and eaten without 
paring, as the best flavour goes with the skin. This is 
the custom with the best society in this country and 
abroad. Eggs are washed with a cloth in cold water 
before boiling, and eaten in egg cups from the shell, 
chipping the small end off, or broken into larger glasses, 
or held in the napkin and eaten from the shell with 
entire good form, in either method. Where individual 
salt-cellars are used they should be emptied after each 
meal, and the salt thrown away, that one person may 
not use it after another, and they should be very small, 



22 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

that there be less wasted. Butter should be piled round 
a lump of ice in little pats. To be very nice, as many 
have learned to like it from living abroad, it should be 
churned daily from perfectly sweet cream, worked with- 
out being touched by the hands or with water, and with- 
out a particle of salt. Thus it has the delicate flavour 
of cream at its best. Honey is especially a breakfast 
delicacy, and so is maple syrup, which should be served 
in small saucers to be eaten with hot biscuit. A basket 
of crisp cakes, toasted rusk and crackers, will accom- 
pany coffee. 

For lunch, the coloured table cloths may be used, if 
ever, though their use is gradually dropped because the 
colours do not wash well. White cloths, with striped 
border, in colours, or fine gray or unbleached damask, 
with napkins to match, assist the easy half-dress style 
of this repast. Cups of broth and thick chocolate, with 
light meats, hashes, croquettes, and stews. Salad and 
fruit are the staple variety, and rather more attractive 
than the cold meat, tea and cracker fare too often set 
apart for this hurried meal. Nowhere is negligence 
more annoying than at luncheon, and the cloth, glasses, 
and arrangements should be fastidiously neat to do 
away with the disagreeable feeling that everybody is too 
busy with drudgery to look after comfort. Insist that 
the girl who waits on the table has her hair neat, her 
hands washed, and a clean apron and collar on. An 
unkempt servant will spoil the best dinner appetite was 
ever sharp-set for. Ceremonious lunches mean an 
hour's visit with a meal, at which salads, shell-fish, 
chops, in paper frills, and broiled chicken play a part, 
with ices, tarU, and faiK^v cakes for dessert. Mixed 



TABLE TALK. 23 

drinks, like Reorent's punch, or claret sup, with ale and 
beer, are more in keeping at lunch than wines. These 
drinks are served from the side -board, the malt liquors 
in common goblets, the claret sup in tumblers, the 
punch in small cups. Beef tea is taken from cups held 
in small saucere, or in small Chinese bowls, with little 
saucers. The absence of all ceremony with the presence 
of light charming detail makes the luncheon attractive. 
For dinner, the family table wants to have less the air 
of hotel arrangements. More delicate napery and ware 
whether the latter is only " seconds, " or the finest egg- 
shell china ; lighter, more covenient, knives and forks, 
and heavier teaspoons, nice thin glass for drinking, 
thick cut crystal for sweets, with, above all things, a well- 
kept cruet stand, make the difi'erence in favor of home 
taste and home comfort. Keep all cracked and nicked 
ware from the table. Buy nothing that cannot be 
replaced without regret, but let each article be the beat 
of its material. There is choice in the quality of stone 
ware and blown glass as well as in the shapes of each. 
The plainest is always most satisfactory of inexpensive 
things. The old fashion of furnishing dining-rooms in 
dark and heavy styles is reversed. The room is light, 
cheerful, warm in colour, the chairs broad and substan- 
tial, the table lower than it used to be, two points which 
add sensibly to the comfort of those who use them. 
Have the chair feet shod with rubber tips which come 
for the purpose, or if on castors, cover the wheel with 
rubber so that they can move without noise. See that 
the room is light and especially warm, for people want 
comfort at meals of all times, and they feel the cold 
more in sitting 



DINNER ETIQUETTE. 



Directions for a ceremonious dinner naturally include 
those for the family table, as much form in serving 
being kept as may be convenient. The number of guests 
for a state dinner rarely exceeds twelve. 

Written invitations are always complimentary and in 
finer style than any other for small parties, but persons 
who entertain often, have engraved cards with blanks 
left for the name of guest, and date, for convenience. 
The following is a form adopted for dinner cards, a 
large, nearly square form being used : 

Mr. and Mrs. — 

Request the pleasure of 

Company (name.) 

date and Na 



_.. o'clock. 

The favoui of an answer ia requested, 
(or) B. 8. V. P. 

For a gentleman's party the host's name alone 
appears on the . invitation. An early answer must be 
aent in all cases, either to accept or decline. Not to do 
BO is the gr(;ssest rudenessj. 



DINNEB ETIQUETTE. 25 

Invitations are always sent to persons in the same 
town by private messenger. Outside envelopes are 
necessary only when sent by mail to another city. No 
particular excuse need be sent. It is enough to say " Mr 

and Mrs. regret that they are unable to accept 

Mr. and Mrs. kind invitation for the date 

named." When the dinner is to meet any particular 
guest or distinguished person, it is made known by the 
words, " To meet So-and-So," at the head of the invi- 
tation, or after the name of the invited person before 
the date. 

Written invitations are on note sheets of mill -finished 
paper with side fold, the fancy, rough, and the highly 
1 lazed papera of eccentric shapes and fold being out of 
ise. The large envelope, nearly square, allows the 
sheet to be doubled once to fit Cards have the same 
finish, neither dull nor highly polished. The cipher of 
initials entwined is prefeiTed to the monogram, and 
occupies the comer of the note sheet. 

Guests aiTive at any time during the half hour before 
dinner, and, after leaving wi-aps in the dressing-room, 
are met by the host and hostess at the door of the drawing 
room. Introductions follow if the guest is a stranger. If 
the party is given in honour of any distinguished person, 
or favourite visitor, the other guests are brought up to 
him or her and presented. It is an omen of success for 
her evening if the hostess can make convei'sation general 
before dinner. To this end, have some novelty at hand, 
either in the shape of a personage whom everybody wants 
to meet, or a new picture, a grotesque group, a rare plant 
in the drawing-room, the latest piece of news to tell, or 



26 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

a pretty girl to bring forward. Whatever the attraction, 
bring it on at once, to prevent that very stupid half-hour. 
At tiie hour, the servant comes in and tells the hostess 
dinner is served. The arranging of the guests has all 
been considered beforehand. If she wishes people to 
think her dinner a pleasant one, the hostess will see that 
the likings of her guests are consulted in pairing off for 
the table. Host and hostess intimate to the gentlemen 
whom they are to escort. " Mr. Lance, will you be kind 
enough to take Miss Dart in to dinner. Mr. Curtis, be 
so good as to see Mrs. Vane. Jermingham, I know you'd 
prefer Miss Olney, she's such a good listener. Mr. King, 
if you want to finish telling that story to Mrs. Capron, 
suppose you give her your arm, " and so on. If the guest 
to be honoured is a lady, the host offers her his arm and 
goes out first, the hostess last. If a gentleman, he escorts 
the hostess, and the host foUows the company. Before 
dinner is announced, after the guests have airived, the 
host has the names of each person written on a card and 
laid on the plates at the place where he or she is to sit. 
This does away with that awkward moment when the 
guests are in the dinning room waiting to be told their 
places. The method long used at public dinners is now 
adopted for private ones in the best circles. 

The standard size for dinner tables is four and-a-half 
feet wide, by any length desired. Round tables for gen- 
tlemen's dinners, where all are wanted in the conversa- 
tion are made seven feet across. Dining chairs should 
have cushioned seats covered with fine leather, but no 
arms, or very low ones, that will not impede the flow of 
ladies' di-csses. People who make a study of entertain- 



DINNER EnQUETTK 27 

inc are particular on such points. Eaoh gentleman 
offers his right arm to the lady he takes to dinner and 
aeats her on his left, which gives occasion for a pretty 
piece of attention on his part. On reaching their places, 
he draws out her chair for her, and as her hand leaves 
his arm he takes the tips of her fingers and hands her 
to her seat, relinquishing his touch with a slight bow or 
glance of acknowledgment. Of course, the honoured 
guest, if a lady, takes the right hand of the host ; if a 
gentleman, he is at the right of the hostess. 

Small can-shaped pitchei-s of engi-aved ciystal, holding 
about a quart, aie placed with ice water between each pair 
of guests. The napkins are folded flat, with a thick piece 
of bread on each, a cruet-stand and silver salt cellar ib at 
each comer, and a silver butter dish at each end. The 
small individual salt cellars and butter plates, have an 
air of hotel arrangrements which it is desirable to avoid at 
home dinners, though entirely admissable and convenient 
at breakfast. If wax lights are used, there should be as 
many candles as guests, according to the old rule. These 
are in branches held by Sevres and Dresden figures, 
above the heads of the guests. Nor are wax lights by any 
means the extravagance they seem. Dinner napkins 
are from three-quarters to seven-eighths of a yard square, 
and should match the cloth, for which Greek, Moresque, 
and Celtic filigrees and diaper patterns are preferred to 
large arabesques and fruit pieces. French napkins of 
fine fringed damask, with crimson figures of lobster and 
crawfish woven in the centre, are sometimes used at first, 
and removed with the fish. Decorations must be choice 
and used with discretion. Flowers should be fine but 



28 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

fow, for cultivated senses find their odor does not mingle 
pleasantly with that of food. All artificial contrivances, 
like epergnes and show-pieces, tin gutters lined with 
moss and filled with flowers for the edges of a table, or 
mirror plates to reflect baskets of blossoms, are banished 
by the latest and best taste. The finest fruit grouped in 
the centre of the table, set ofi" with leaves, the garnished 
dishes, the lustre of glass and silver, and the colours of 
delicately painted china, need no improvement as a 
picture. A low silver basket of flowers at the sides, and 
a crystal bouquet holder with a delicate blossom and 
leaf, sparingly introduced, are all that is allowed for 
ornament's sake. Large dinner services of one pattern 
ai*e no longer chosen. The meats and large dishes are 
in silver or electroplate ware, the sweets come in heavy 
English cut crystal, and each course brings with it plates 
of a difieient ware. 

The order of wines is sometimes perplexing, and the 
novice should remember that Chablis or Sauterne comes 
with the small oysters before soup, and that Sheny is 
drank after soup. Claret may be taken by those who 
prefer it during a whole dinner with entire propriety. 
Champagne comes with the roast, and Burgundy v/ith 
game. The French and Germans leserve champagne 
for a dessert wine, but we drink it with both roast and 
dessert. After dessert comes coffee, Tvhich should be 
served, however, in the drawing-ioom. Fingerbowls 
with warm water are placed on the napkin on the dessert 
plate, and removed by the guest to the left, to be used 
oy dipping the fingers in lightly and drying them on the 
Doily. When the ladies are quite through with dessert 



DINNER ETIQUETTE. 29 

the hostess catches the eye of each or raises her gloved 
hand slightly, as a signal, and they leave the table, the 
oldest lady going first, the youngest last, followed by the 
hostess — the youngest gentleman, or the one nearest the 
door, taking it on himself to hold the door open. After 
half an hour a guest is at liberty to withdraw, but a 
dinner party rarely breaks up till half past ten or later, 
if cards, and dancing follow. 

As to the individual etiquette of the table, on seating 
himself a guest draws off his gloves, and lays them in his 
lap under the napkin, which should be spread lightly not 
tucked in the dress. The raw oystere are eaten with a 
fork ; the soup, only a ladleful to each plate, is sipped 
from the side of the spoon, without noise, or tilting the 
plate. The head should never stoop toward the plate or 
cup, but the shoulders kept straight and the food lifted 
to the mouth, the head bent naturally a little. A quiet 
celerity in eating is preferable to the majestic deliberation 
which many people consider genteel. Bread should be 
broken, never cut at table, and should be eaten morsel 
by morsel, not crumbled into soup or gravy. Food 
should not be mixed on the plate. Sweet corn is brought 
on, tied in its husk by a strip of leaf, and should be 
eaten from the cob, breaking the ear in two, and holding 
the piece in the left hand. Asparagus should not be 
touched with the fingers, but the tender part cut up, 
and eaten with the fork. Fish is eaten with the fork, 
assisted by a piece of bread in the left hand. Macca- 
roni is cut and taken with the fork, unless served with 
the tomatoes, when a teaspoon is allowed, as with green 
peas, and stewed tomatoes alone. Cheese is crumbled 



30 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

with the fork and eaten with it, never touched by the 
fingers. Pastry should be broken by the fork without 
the aid of a knife. Game and chicken are cut up, nevei 
picked with the fingers, unless in the indulgence of a 
family dinner, when the bone may be held in one hand 
and eaten. Pears are held by the stem to be pared 
and then cut and eaten like apples, beginning to remove 
the skin at the blossom end. Oranges are held on a 
fork while peeled and divided without breaking the skin. 
Cherries in pie, or natural, should have the stones 
passed to the napkin held at the lips and returned to 
the plate, and grape seeds and skins are disposed of in 
the same way. Salt is left on the edge of the plate, not 
on the table. Ladies take but a single glass of any wine 
at most, having their glasses half -filled with champagne 
a second time. It is beginning to be the custom to take 
soft bread as well as ice-cream with cake. Cocoanut 
pudding looks like pie, but is helped and eaten with a 
spoon. Small meringues are best eaten with a spoon, 
though the practice is to take them in the fingers. 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES. 



The simplest society duty is, that of making calls. A 
new comer should return each call within two weeks 
after it is made. After this, a call once in six months 
or a year, serves to keep up acquaintance. Calls are 
due to a hostess two days after a dinner party, and two 
days after a ball, and a week after a small party, though 
these are amply fultilled by leaving one's card in the 
case of a gentleman, a personal call being polite from a 
lady who has more time. 

In town, leaving a card with the comer bent signifies 
that it was left by its owner in person, not sent by a 
servant. Bending the edges of a card, means that the 
visit was designed for the young ladies of the house, as 
well as the mistress of it. If there is a visitor with the 
family whom you wished to see, a separate card should 
be left for that person, naming him or her to th# ser- 
vant. A card should also be left for the host, if the call 
was designed as a family matter, but more than three 
are not left at one housa 

Visits of condolence are paid within a week after the 
funeral, and are as well expressed by leaving a card and 
kind inquiries of the servant. This is the only proper 
thing to do in case of sickness, beside asking if one can 



32 THE HOME COOK no<iK 

be of use. Visitfs of congratulation are paid in person. 
After the birth of a child, cards and inquiries are left 
at the door, when the lady is able to receive her friends, 
she sends her card in return " with thanks for kind in- 
quiries," after which calls are made on her in person. 

Bending the corners of the cards to signify "condo' 
lence," "felicitation," "to take leave," etc., is not used 
so much as a penciled word or two, to express one's 
" kind inquiries," if there is trouble in the house, or 
" best wishes," if there is a wedding, or engagement. 

The P. P. C card when one is going away, is a con- 
venient way of letting friends know of your absence, the 
initials of "pour prendre conge" being often relinquished 
for the plain English " to take leave. " On returning, 
cards are sent to all the friends one wishes to see, with 
one's address, and receiving day, when one day of the 
week is set apart for company. 

From three to six are proper calling hours, and a 
visit may be from five minutes to half an hour, never 
longer, unless with a very intimate friend. A gentle- 
man leaves his umbrella in the hall, but carries hat 
and cane with him, keeping the former in his left hand, 
never venturing to lay it on table or rack, unless in- 
vited to do so by the lady of the house. Her not doing 
so is a sign that it is not convenient for her to prolong 
his call. 

A soft hat is tolerated, but the dress hat is usually 
carried. 

The lady of the house rises to receive any guest, un- 
less it be a very young one, and gives her hand. After 
the visit, she receives a gentleman's bow, and if disposed 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES. 33 

to be very polite, walks with him to the door of the room. 
She sees a lady visitor to the street door, if the parlour 
is on the same floor. If not, going to the head of the 
stairs is sufficient courtesy except to elderly guests. A 
gentleman must escort a lady who makes him a busi- 
ness call to the outer door, and to her carriage, if she 
has one. A caller should take leave as soon as possible 
on the arrival of another visitor, unless asked to stay 

Where a lady has a large acquaintance, it is most con- 
venient for her to set apart a day for receiving their 
calls, of which she admonishes them by her visiting card 
on which the day of the week is pencilled. 

Unless specially invited otherwise, her friends will 
confine their visits to that day of the week. 

To these afternoons the hostess appears in asua) 
afternoon dress ; her rooms are attractive with flowers 
ftnd pictures, but no refreshments are serv^ed. Her 
guests find her, not sitting at the receipt of customs, 
but busy with some elegant trifle of lace or wool-work, 
writing letters, or touching a sketch, to be laid aside on 
the entrance of visitors. 

The set afternoon reception is announced by this form 
of card, the hostess usually preferring to have some 
young lady with her to add to the attractions of her 
house.

34 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

If there be a card receiver in the hall, the visitor's card 
is left in it, that the hostess may have the pleasure after- 
ward of recalling all the friends who favour her with 
their presence. 

Coffee, chocolate, cake and ices, are to be found in a 
side room at such receptions. 

The form of card for afternoon tea, which means ladies 
in visiting or carriage dress, a harlequin tea service, each 
cup different, or a set of choice East India China, rooms 
cosy with warm curtains, and signs of womanly occupa- 
tion, everything in short to have the daintiest home-look 
possible, are issued in this fashion : 

Mks. Bradley Cowles, 
Friday, January ISt^j, 
Tea at 4 o'clock, 
(Name and No. of street.) 

Guests arrive in the five minutes before the hour, or the 
five minutes after. The tea is brought in punctually and 
placed on the hostess' table in the corner, where are the 
urns of black, green and Russian tea for those who like 
each, a basket of wafers, delicate sandwiches of chicken 
or thin sliced meats, and a basket of fancy cake. If the 
English style is followed, the cups of tea are carried to 
the guests on a tray, and a tiny table to rest the cups on 
placed in the reach of each group. 

Cards are issued for dinner parties and afternoon recep- 
tions in distinction from evening parties and weddings, 
invitations to which are engraved on note paper. Written 
invitations are more complimentary than printed ones, 
but the idea of cards and engraved requests is to save 
the labour of writing notes for a large party, or 



SOCIAL OBSERVANCES. 85 

where one entertains continually. Written invita- 
tions for the honour and style of the thing, cards 
and engraving for convenience, though this is perhaps 
contrary to the popular notion. Written invitations 
should be as fastidiously correct as printed ones, on 
miU-finished side-fold note sheets with cipher in the 
comer, and written in the same form as cards, unless to 
a familiar friend, when such precision would be absurd. 
Outside envelopes are only used when invitations are 
sent by mail. And whether so requested in the note or 
not, answer to accept or decline should be sent as soon 
as possible, no matter how slight the invitation may be, 
even to dine with a gentleman, or go to a picture gal- 
lery. It will not do to present oneself without a word 
to announce one's coming, or to stay away and appolo- 
gize the first time of meeting. Good breeding is hardly 
shown in nicer points than this. 

The person entering a room is the one to salute the 
company by a good morning, or how do you do, and to 
make his adieus, to which the rest respond. Where a 
stranger enters a small company, each one should be 
separately presented. The guest salutes the hostess and 
host before speaking to anyone else, and if the party is 
large, is introduced to two or three convenient persons 
that he may have somebody to talk to, though in a pri- 
vate house guests may accost each other without formal 
presentation. Near the close of a party, the host and 
hostess usually are to be found near the door of the par- 
lour, and guests take leave of them with a bow and 
compliment for a pleasant evening, then pass to the 
dressing rooms after wraps and vanish without further 



86 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

ceremony. In small circles a bow should be given to 
each person about one, and leave taken of any special 
friend whose conversation has been particularly pleasant. 

A gentleman does not shake hands with a ladj'^ not of 
his kindred, unless she offers to do so. Unmarried 
ladies do not give their hands in salute to any but gen- 
tlemen relations. Ladies in any case give the hand, 
the gentleman respectfully presses it without shaking. 
It is a piece of stupid bad breeding, however, not to take 
the hand of anyone offered in ignorance of the rule. 
The best breeding always adapts itself to the customs of 
those about one. 

When a gentleman escorts a lady to a party, he waits 
for her near the door of the ladies' dressing-room till 
she shows herself, gives her his right arm, or gives it to 
the elder lady if he takes two, and goes up to the host- 
ess with her to make salutations, then after a sentence 
or two, turning away to join the company. After a 
dance with any lady it is proper to take half a turn 
round the room in promenade with her, and take her to 
the refeshment room if she wishes, always leaving her 
with her chaperone. An unmarried lady does not ask 
gentlemen to call, but the gentleman asks permission 
for the favour of her, or waits to be invited by her 
father or mother. 



i 



THE 

LITTLE HOUSEKEEPERS. 



It often happens that a good deal of knowledge which 
we are not conscious of possessing — but which iinds its 
way somehow into the brains of big and little people as 
well — comes very readly to hand when it is needed. It 
80 happened with Annie and Jennie, whose first practi- 
cal lessons in housekeeping, began after breakfast one 
morninff when Bridgfet was absent at her sister's funeral, 
and in consequence of an accident by which mamma 
sprained her ankle. 

And the doctor had said, with a very wise shake of 
his head, and any amount of wisdom in his eye, that 
" Little Mother " must not step on that foot for three 
days, she grew still whiter with dismay, for Bridget 
would not be back until quite late in the day, and how 
was all the house work to be done and nobody to do it ? 

It was thus that Annie's and Jennie's first practical 
experiences in housekeeping began, and as our object in 
telling you how and what they did is to give you some 
idea how you should manage in similar cii'cum stances 
I must not pass over their mother's first caution : B'fore 
coirnynencing your work prepare yourselves for it. This 
they did by putting long sleeved aprons over their 



38 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

dresses, and rolling back their sleeves, when it was evident 
the right place to begin with was 

THE DINING ROOM. 

The first thing here to do, was the clearing of the 
table. In this, all the clean silver, china, and dishes 
that had not been used, were first put away in the silver 
drawer, the china closet and on the side-board. Next, 
the dishes to be cleaned were collected together ; the 
silver and the knives were first put into a pitcher of hot 
water, with the bowls and blades downwards. Next, the 
water was emptied from the glasses, and the cofiee from 
the cups into a basin, and while Annie took these into 
tlie kitchen and placed them there on the table, Jennie 
gathered the plates in a pile, the cups and the saucers, 
each by themselves, in this way they were quickly and 
easily carried to the kitchen. 

They were careful not to take too many at once, as 
they would be liable to break them. Then the table- 
cloth was folded and laid in the side-board ; the napkins 
were put in the napkin basket ; the dining room floor 
was nicely swept and the furniture dusted ; the coal stove 
was attended to, that the fire was not too lively and not 
too low ; and then, after kissing and petting mamma a 
few minutes, the little housekeepers set about 

THE WASHING OF THE DISHES. 

This, of course, with " Little Mother " at the head of 
aftairs, was no disagreeable work, you may be sure. The 
large tin dish-pan, as bright as silver, was placed in the 



THE LITTLE HOUSEKEEPEBS. 39 

sink ; the hot and cold water faucets turned on until the 
temperafcure of the water was hot enough for cleansing 
the dishes, and not too hot for the hands ; then the suda 
were made by stirring about in the water the soap-shaker 
(a little tin box with soap in it, and perforated with holes 
having a long handle like a dipper). Then the glasses 
were first washed and quickly wiped on clean dry towels ; 
then the silver; then the pretty china cups, saucers, 
plates and other dishes, which were then rinsed by pour- 
ing clear hot water over them in another pan, from which 
they were wiped with the coarser towels. This finished, 
Jennie removed the dishes from the kitchen table, putting 
the silver, glass and china away, while Anni e washed 
the sauce-pans and the tins, putting them in their places 
in the kitchen ; then brushed the range and swept the 
kitchen floor ; after which they washed their hands well 
and di'ied them on the roller-towel ; and then our little 
housekeepers set themselves about preparations for 

THE CHA^IBER WORK. 

First, the two little girls went into mamma's room, 
and put on over their bright glossy curls two little 
Martha Washington dusting-caps of pink and blue cam- 
bric, trimmed around the edges with scolloped ruffles, 
and ornamented with pretty little fanciful bows of pink 
and blue cambric, with scolloped edges. Then Annie 
took the pails and cloths, and Jennie the brushes, and 
brooms, and went up stairs. 

The first rule of chamber work is to open the windows 
and turn down the bed clothes to air them well ; beating 
up the pillows and the mattress. As Annie and Jennie 



40 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

always did this the first thing after dressing in the morn- 
ing, and before going down to breakfast, the fii'st thing 
now to do was to make up the bed. While Annie went 
to the further side, Jennie remained on the other, and 
thus, each sheet and blanket was brought up and laid 
over straight and smooth, with not a wrinkle in sheet 
or blanket, or a single article out of line. When all was 
done, the spread and blankets were turned neatly back, 
with the pretty ruflSed sheet lying back on the nice white 
counterpane ; the clothes were all neatly tucked and 
folded at the sides and the corners, and the pillows put 
up against the headboard. Then, while Annie washed 
the bed-room service, first emptying the waste water, and 
then washing out the cleanest dishes in warm suds, 
Jennie brushed the room, dusted the furniture and put 
the hair and clothes-brushes in order, and arranged the 
bureau and toilet table. They followed the same order 
in their brother John's room, which was all of the cham- 
ber work to be done that day, and then went down stairs. 
By this time the little housekeepers began to feel tired, 
and so they rested a while in their two little easy chairs 
in mamma's room, talking to mamma and each other 
until it came the time for getting ready for the 

LUNCHEON. 

As John took his dinner with him to school, and papa 
ate his luncheon down town, and would not be home 
until the five o'clock dinner, there was only mamma and 
the two little girls to partake of this repast together ; and 
as mamma's luncheons were such cosy, tasteful, though 
simple meals, we may gain some suggestions from the way 



THE LITTLE HOUSEKEEPERS, 41 

our little housekeepers prepared them. The first thing 
to do in getting any meal, is to decide upon the various 
dishes to be served. A look at the supply of prepared 
food was quite disheartening to the ambitious desires 
of the little housekeepers, as there was bread and cake 
and cold meat in plenty, and it seemed as though there 
would be no opportunity for practising their skill in 
cooking. But mamma, who saw the troubled look on 
the little faces, made out the following 

BILL OF FARE. 

Tea. 

WUte Bread. Brown Bread. Crackers. 

Ham. 

Cheese Saudwiche*. 

Jombles. Preserved Strawbeniea. 

Whipped Cream. 

Now, it must be remembered, that in this arrange- 
a)ent, the bread was at hand ready to slice ; the ham 
was boiled, ready to cut ; and the strawberries ready in 
the little glass can to be opened. There remained, 
therefore, jumbles and tea to make, and the cheese 
sandwiches to prepare. Following mamma's advice, 
the}' first undertook the jumbles, of which they were to 
make but half the recipe. They selected for this " Ex- 
cellent Jumbles," in the home cook book, and while 
Jennie held the book and read the ingredients, Annie 
collected them together. Thus : one-half a cup of but- 
ter, one cup of sugar, and one-half cup of cream, and

given nile, and put the whole egg in. Then Jennie read 
on : " A little nutmeg; flour enough to stiffen it, so as 
to bake in rings ; bake quickly." 

The flour was sifted; the butter and sugar first 
creamed together by Annie, while Jennie beat the yoke 
of the egg, and added it to the creamed sugar and but- 
ter ; then they put in the nutmeg, the cream and the 
soda; then the beaten white of the egg, and the sifted 
flour ; then they put the jumbles into the buttered rings 
and baked them. As the oven was quick and hot, I am 
happy to say these jumbles were a success. In taking 
them out of the tins when done, they did not pile them on 
one another, but placed them carefully /xbout on a large 
plate to cool. Then the little housekeepers made the 
tea, according to the directions in the Cook Book, and 
also the cheese sandwiches, which were a complete suc- 
cess. The cutting of the bread was a difficult task, since 
to be nice the slices should be even and thin, but it was 
managed * nevertheless with patience and care. When 
all was ready, the cream nicely whipped, the strawber- 
ries put in the preserve dish, the little round table in 
mamma's room drawn out, and the luncheon arranged, 
they were just ready to sit down to enjoy the fruits of 
their labour, what should they hear but Bridget's voice 
at the door. So it came to pass, that with the luncheon 
ended for this time the practical experiments of our little 
housekeepers. But it all goes to prove that, if we live 
with our eyes open, we shall all of us find that, with 
such help as our Home Cook Book, we shall be ready 
for those emergencies which come to big as well as the 
little housekeepers, when Bridget is not at hand. 



OUR SUSAN'S OPINION OF A KITCHEN. 



" My opinion of a kitchen ?" said Susan, in a tone, with 
a glance, and a wave of her fork that spoke unwritten 
volumes, as she translated the perfection of fried cakes 
from the frying kettle to a tin colander to di'ain ; " My 
opinion of a kitchen ? Well, that would vary somewhat 
with the mansion that contained it. In any case, how- 
ever, it would be the pleasantest room in the house, if I 
had the ordering of things." 

The queen of our kitchen said this with a half smile 
and a half apology, as she continued : " It makes a good 
deal of difference, you know, to one who is to spend the 
best part of her time there. I often think that many 
people with whom money is no object, have very limited 
ideas of their responsibilities when it comes to the ser- 
vant's quarter in the houses they build, with all they may 
have of modern improvements and conveniences. 

" I have no conceit of those fine houses," said she, 
with considerable asperity of manner, " with not a room 
in it but where a regiment might meander comfortably 
about among the furniture but the kitchen, which is only 
large enough for the range, the sink, the ironing table, 

and the cook. Neither for my part, could I ever

keep servants, and where the mistress expects to do her

own work, who allows, of all rooms in the house, her 
kitchen to be built a dark little box of a place, prevaded 
with the sole idea of work. Of work, too, without one 
gleam of cheerfulness about it, and from which every one 
who enters escapes with a glad feeling of relief. For 
my part," she continued, " I don't see why making fried 
cakes, and baking biscuit, and washing dishes, might not 

be made as bright and attractive as, well, as any 

thing else one has to do in the way of house work. 

" A[y opinion of a kitchen, ' as is a kitchen,' is one with 
room enough about for the many little things and com- 
forts that give it a home-like look ; a ' living room,' as we 
used to call our kitchen in the old home. For instance 
this comes the nearest my idea of it ; always excepting 
that" she said, with a gratified glance around at the 
pretty clock on its pretty bracket, and the newspaper 
rack, (for Susan enjoj'-ed the papers,) at the various nick- 
nacks, and the landsca{)es, and home views, which Susan 
prized far above the costly conventional fruit and game 
pieces on the dining room walls. And then Susan's 
glance wandered, with a pleased softened look to the 
sunny window, with its geranium pots and hanging 
basket, near which the most cheerful of canaries in his 
cage made all the air melodious with song. Here, also, 
stood an easy chair inviting rest for those moments of 
waiting iipon work which so often occur, and near it a 
stand with drawers for all sorts of little treasures which 
contained all of fancy work in which Susan ever indulged, 
"That easy chair, and that window, are great comforts 
to m.e," she resumed. " Now, if there was but one 
wind/^w to ray kitchen, and the sink before that, as I see 



OUR SUSAN'S OPINION OF A KITCHEN. 45 

in 80 many kitchens, if I had to take refuge in a stiff- 
backed chair in a dark corner or the middle of the room 
where I could reach out and touch the walls all around 
whUe I was waiting for the biscuit to rise, or the cake 
was baking, as I sat there glaring at some dark melan- 
choly paper, instead of this bright cheerful tint of gray, 
with its hints of rose and violet, and then with the 
wood-work about, of an ugly, dingy blue, or mud col- 
oured brown, instead of this bright-grained wood, with 
gleams of sunshine in it on the darkest days, and that is 
so easy to keep clean and is as pretty as a picture. I 
think if this was that kind of a kitchen, I would run 
away with the milkman some bright morning — I actu- 
ally think I would." This is a standing joke of our 
Susan's, but one nevertheless that brings fear and con- 
sternation in our household whenever it is revived. " I 
suppose I was spoiled for that sort of thing in my early 
days," said she, meditatively, with a look in her eyes 
that went out for the moment, " over the hills and far 
away," to the kitchen, where we first found our Susan. 

It was a wide, long room — so wide and long that the 
dresser and clock and tables and large old-fashioned 
furniture that stood here and there, never intruded 
themselves, but in large, comely, decorous, but uncom- 
promising dignity, formed each a part of the hai-moni- 
ous whole. There was an indescidbable charm about 
it, always orderly, always bright and the centre of a 
home-life where its duties went on in that easy cheerful 
way, a pleasure both to sight and sense. About its 
many windows, all the summer time, the roses clam- 
bered in sweet confusion, and through which the scent

of the fragrant sweet-briar came floating in, with the 
song of tlie woodland birds and the pleasant farm 
sounds, and a vision of the far away hills, in their ever 
varying beauty of light and shadow ; while within, in 
conscious enjoyment of it all, was Susan, stepping mer- 
rily about, making custard pies, or folding the fragrant 
linen, fresh from the line, for the morrow's ironing. 
But the prettiest picture of that old kitchen was of a 
winter evening, when the winds blew furiously without, 
of the grand old fire-place, with its heaping wood fire, 
over which on the crane the kettle hung, humming and 
singing, and sending up the chimney white clouds of 
steam, while before it stood the tin baker which held 
the rich juicy roast, or the light snowy biscuit, the like 
of which never came out of any range that ever was, or 
will be invented ; while the fire lighted up the fine old 
room with a rich warm glow, as Susan set the table with 
its snowy linen and polished ware, and golden butter, 
and luscious honey in the comb, and all those charming 
fancies she knew so well how to prepare. And to com- 
plete the picture, the comfortable easy chairs by the 
fire where the grandmother sat in placid enjoyment with 
her knitting, and not very far away, the father, tired 
with the work of the day, giving himself to the rest and 
comforts of the evening hour. This is the picture that 
rose so vividly before me, but which had faded all too 
suddenly from our Susan ^s past. 

Ah, well ! said she, after a time coming out of her 
reverie with a little sigh and back again, to her opinion 
of a kitchen. 

" It is not all of life to live " — making a hap-hazard

selection from her small stock of poetical fancies, but 
checking hei-self before reaching the concluding lines of 
this stanza, 

" My opinion," she said, with a sudden change of tone 
and manner as she snitfed the air — is — that until some 
contrivance is invented to carry oat all the steam, smoke, 
and smell of frying, that with all my care, and in spite 
of windows, and doors, and ventilators, will hang about 
my kitchen, the millenium won't come ; and if it does, / 
shan't bo in it." 

As she said this, we looked around, and there stood 
the Pater. And \y^ knew by the look in his eyes that he 
had heard these words of Susan's. And thus it will 
happen, that the Pater who is a bom inventor, but who 
in the hurry and worry of business life has limited 
opportunities for the indulgence of this natural bent of 
his genius, will seize upon this idea with the pretext of a 
duty, and with which he will retire to the depths of his 
inner consciousness, there to evolve some strange contriv- 
ance hereafter to assume form and shape for the coxnfort- 
ina of " Our Susan's " kitchen.

SOUPS. 



" No nReless dish our table crowds ; 
Harmoniously ranged and consonantly just. 
As in a concert instruments resound, 
Our ordered dishes in their courses chime," 

The basis of all good soups, is the broth of meat. 
This may be made by boiling the cracked joints of beef, 
veal or mutton, and is best when cooked the day before 
it is to be eaten. After putting the meat into the pot, 
cover it well with cold water and let it come to a boil, 
when it should be well skimmed. Set the pot where it 
will simmer slowly until it is thoroughly done, keeping 
the pot closely covered the while. The next day, when 
the soup is cold, remove the fat, which will harden on 
the top of the soup. After this, add the vegetables and 
the herbs you use for seasoning, cooking all well together. 
Before sending to the table, the soup should be strained. 
A good stock for soups may be made from shreds and 
bits of uncooked meat and bones, poultry and the re- 
mains of game. When these are all put together and 
stewed down in the pot, the French term it consomme, 
and use it chiefly in the preparation of brown soups. 

Soups may be varied in many ways, chiefly in the kinds 
of vegetables and diflerent seasonings used, — as in herbs,

burned caramel, eggs or slices of bread fried to a crisp 
in butter, which impart a savoury relish. 

EGG BALLS FOR SOUP.

floured hands, and set in a cool place until just before 
your soup comes off, when you put them in carefully and 
boil one minute.

split peas previously washed ; boil four hours. Before 
serving stir smartly with your potato-masher, strain 
through a colander into your tureen. Many like tomato 
catsup in this, but it is better to serve that separate.

strain through a colander and leave it in the dish during 
the night, which is the only way to get off all the fat. 



54 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

The da}' it is wanted for the table, fry as brown as possi- 
ble a carrot, an onion and a very small turnip sliced thin. 
Just before taking up, put in half a teaspoonful of sugar, 
a blade of mace, six cloves, a dozen kernels of allspice, a 
small tablespoonful of celery seed. With the vegetables

ing, (over water to prevent scorching.) When the toma- 
toes are done add a large teaspoonful of salaratus, which 
will cause a violent effervescence. It is best to set the 
vessel in a pan before adding it to prevent waste. 
When the commotion has ceased add the milk and 
seasoning. When it is possible it is best to use more 
milk than water, and cream instead of butter. The soup 
is eaten with crackers and is by some preferred to oyster 
soup. This recipe is very valuable for those who keep 
abstinence days.

boil for ten minutes ; salt should be added while mixing 
with the flour — about a saltspoonful. 

CARAMEL, OR BURNED SUGAR. 

Put two ounces of brown or white sugar in an old tin 
cup over a brisk fire, stir this until it is quite dark and 
gives forth a burned smell, then add half a cup of cold 
water ; let it boil gently a few minutes, stirring well and 
all the while. Take off", and when cold bottle for use. 
This keeps well, and may be used for flavoring gravies 
and soups. 



FISH. 



"The silv^ery fish. 
Grazing at large in meadows submarine. 
Fresh from the wave now cheers 
Our festive board." 

—Anon. 

Fish are good, when the gills are red, eyes are full, and 
the body of the fish is firm and stiff. After washing them 
well, they should he allowed to remain for a short time in 
salt water sufficient to cover them ; before cooking, wipe 
them dry, dredge lightly with flour, and season with salt 
and pepper, Salmon trout and other small fish are 
usually fried or broiled ; all large fish should be put in a 
cloth, tied closely with twine, and placed in cold water, 
when they may be put over thr fire to boil When fish 
are baked, prepare the fish the same as for boiling, and 
put in the oven on a wire gridiron, over a dripping pan. 

SUGGESTIONS AS TO FISH, POULTRY, &c. 

Miss Riley. 

Cod-Fish — requires great care in cleaning, particularly 
in cleansing the back-bone from blood which spoils its 
appearance, anti sometimes renders it too unsightly for 
the table. Fishes that are to de dressed in their scales.

should be dipped in water, and rubbed with a coarse 
towel to remove the shine. All salt fish should be 
properly soaked in water, previous to cooking. It is 
asserted that a small proportion of sugar will keep fish 
perfectly fresh for several days ; it also cures salmon and 
white fish with a little salt added to please the taste 
Fresh water fish has often a muddy smell and taste ; to 
take this off", soak it in strong salt and water after it is 
nicely cleansed, then dry and dress it. 

BOILED WHITE FISa 

Mrs. Andrews. 

Lay the fish open ; put it in a dripping pan, with the 
back down ; nearly cover with water ; to one fish put two 
tablespoons salt ; cover tightly and simmer (not boil) one- 
half hour ; dress with gravy, butter and pepper ; garnish 
with sliced eggs. 

For sauce use a piece of butter the size of an egg, one 
tablespoon of flour, one- half pint boiling water ; boil a 
few minutes, and add three hard boiled eggs, sliced. 

FISH A LA CREME. 

Mrs. J. A. Ellis. 

Take any firm salt water fish, rub it with salt and put 
it in a kettle with enough boiling water to cover it. As 
soon as it boils set it back where it will simmer, let it 
stand for an hour, then take it up and draw out all the 
bones. Put one ounce of flour into a sauce-pan, to which 
add by degrees one quart of cream or new milk, mixing it 
very smoothly, then add the juice of one lemon, one 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 65 

onion chopped fine, a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, 

salt and pepper. Put this on the fire, stirring it till it 

forms a thick sauce; stir in a quarter of a pound of 

butter ; strain the sauce through a sieve. Put a little on 

a dish, then lay the fish on it and turn the remainder of 

the sauce over it. Beat to a froth the whites of six eggs, 

spread over the whole, and bake half an hour a light 

brown. 

SAUCE FOR BOILED FISH. 

To one teacup of milk ; add one teacup of water ; put 
it on the fire to scald, and when hot stir in a tablespoon 
of flour, previously wet with cold water ; add two or 
three eggs ; season with salt and pepper, a little celery, 
vinegar and three tablespoons of butter. Boil four or 
five eggs hard, take off the shells, and cut in slices, and 
lay over the dish. Then pour over the sauce and serve. 

BAKED HALIBUT OR SALMON. 

Let the fish remain in cold water, slightly salted, for 
an hour before it is time to cook it ; place the gridiron 
on a dripping pan with a little hot water in it and bake 
in a hot oven ; just before it is done, butter it well on 
the top, and brown it nicely. The time of baking de- 
pends upon the size of the fish. A small fish will bake 
in about half an hour, and a large one in an hour. 
They are very nice when cooked as above and served 
with a sauce which is made from the gravy in the drip- 
ping pan, to which is added a tablespoon of catsup and 
another of some pungent sauce and the juice of a lemon. 
Thicken with brown flour moistened with a little cold

water. Garnish handsomely with sprigs of parsley and 
currant jeUy. 

BAKED BLACK BASS. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Eight good sized onions chopped fine ; half that 
quantity of bread crumbs ; butter size of hen's egg ; 
plenty of pepper and salt, mix thoroughly with anchovy 
sauce until quite red. Stuff your fish with this com- 
pound and pour the rest over it, previously sprinkling 
it with a little red pepper. Shad, pickerel and trout 
are good the same way. Tomatoes can be used instead 
of anchovies, and are more economical. If using them 
take pork in place of butter and chop fine. 

BROILED WHITE FISH— FRESH. 

Mrs. G. E. P. 

Wash and drain the fish ; sprinkle with pepper and 
lay with the inside down upon the gridiron, and broil 
over fresh bright coals. When a nice brown, turn for 
a moment on the other side, then take up and spread 
with butter. This is a very nice way of broiling all 
kinds of fish, fresh or salted. A little smoke under the 
fish adds to its flavour. This may be made by putting 
two or three cobs under the gridiron. 

SALT MACKEREL. 

Mrs. F. D. J. 

Soak the fish for a few hours in lukewarm water, 
changing the water several times ; then put into cold 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 67 

water loosely tied in cloths, and let the fish come to a 
boil, turning oft' the water once, and pouring over the 
fish hot water from the tea kettle ; let this just come to 
a boil, then take them out and drain them, lay them on 
a platter, butter and pepper them, and place them for a 
few moments in the oven. Serve with sliced lemons, 
or with any nice fish sauce. 

BOILED CODFISH— SALT. 

Soak two pounds of codfish in lukewarm water over 
night or for several hours ; change the water several 
times ; about one hour before dinner put this into cold 
jfresh water, and set over the fire ; let it come to a boil, 
or just simmer, for fiften minutes but not to boil hard, 
then take out of the water, drain and serve with egg 
sauce, or with cold boiled eggs sliced and laid over it, 
with a drawn butter or cream gravy poured over all. 

CODFISH BALLS, 

Take equal quantities of mashed potatoes and boiled 
codfish minced fine ; to each half-pound allow one ounce 
of butter and a well-beaten egg ; mix thoroughly. Press 
into balls between two spoons ; drop into hot lard, and 
fry till brown. 

EELS. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Skin and parboil them ; cleanse the back bone of all 
coagulations ; cut them in pieces about three inches ir 
length ; dip in flour and cook in pork fat, brown. 



68 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

CHOWDER. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer. 

Five pounds of codfish cut in squares ; fry plenty of 
salt pork cut in thin slices ; put a layer of pork in your 
kettle, then one of fish ; one of potatoes in thick slices, 
and one of onions in slices ; plenty of pepper and salt ; 
repeat as long as your materials last, and finish with a 
layer of Boston crackers or crusts of bread. Water suffi- 
cient to cook with, or milk if you prefer. Cook one-half 
hour and turn over on your platter, disturbing as little 
as possible. Clams and eels the same way. 

POTTED FISH. 

Mrs. Gridley. 

Take out the backbone of the fish ; for one weighing 
two pounds take a tablespoon of allspice and cloves 
mixed ; these spices should be put into little bags of not 
too thick muslin ; put sufficient salt directly upon each 
fish ; then roll in cloth, over which sprinkle a little 
cayenne pepper ; put alternate layers of fish, spice and 
sago in an earthen jar ; cover with the best cider vinegar ; 
cover the jar closely with a plate and over this put a 
covering of dough, rolled out twice the thickness of pie 
crust. Make the edges of paste, to adhere closely to the 
sides of the jar, so as to make it air-tight. Put the jar 
into a pot of cold water and let it boil from three to five 
hours, according to quantity. Ready when cold. 

Sauces far " Fish and Meat " will follow " Meats." 



SHELL FISH. 



OYSTERS ON THE SHELL. 

Wash the shell and put them on hot coals, or upon 
the top of a hot stove, or bake them in a hot oven ; open 
the shells with an oyster knife, taking care to lose none 
of the liquor, and serve quickly on hot plates, ^^dth toasts 
Oysters may be steamed in the shells, and are excellent 
eaten in the same manner. 

CREAMED OYSTER.^.

POULTRY AND GAME. 



" Whoso seeks an audit here. 
Propitious pays his tribute — game or fish. 
Wild fowl or Tenison, and his errand speed." ■ 

— COWPKB. 

POULTRY. 

When poultry is brought into the kitchen for use, it 
should be kept as cool as possible. The best position 
in which to place it is with the breast downwards on a 
shelf or marble slab. The crop should be ta,ken out. 
Choose fowls with a thin, transparent skin, white and 
delicate. Time required to boil poultry : a chicken 
will take about 20 minutes; a fowl about 40 minutes; a 
small turkey an hour and a half; a large turkey two 
hours or more, 

BOILED FOWL. 

Take a young fowl and fill the inside with oyst«rs ; 
place in a jar and plunge into a kettle of water ; boil for 
one and one-half hours ; there will be a quantity of 
gravy in the jar from the juice of the fowl and the 
oysters ; make this into white sauce with the addition 
of egg, cream, or a little flour and butter ; add oysters, 
or serve up plain with the fowl. This is very nice with 
the addition of a little parsley to the^auce.

ROAST TURKEY OR CHICKEN. 

Having picked and drawn the fowls, wash them well 
in two or three waters ; wipe them dry ; dredge them 
with a little flour inside and out, and a little pepper and 
salt ; prepare a dressing of bread and cracker crumbs, 
fill the bodies and crops of the fowls and then bake them 
from two to three hours ; baste them frequently while 
roasting ; stew the giblets in a sauce-pan ; just before 
serving, chop the giblets fine ; after taking up the 
chicken, and the water in which the giblets were boiled, 
add the chopped giblets to the gravy of the roast fowl ; 
thicken with a little flour, which has been previously 
wet with the water ; boil up, and serve in a gravy-dish 
Roast chickens and turkey should be accompanied with 
celery and jellies. 

TO BOIL A TURKEY. 

Mrs. Robert Beaty. 

Make a stuffing for the craw of chopped bread and 
butter, cream, oysters, and the yolks of eggs ; sew it in, 
and dredge flour over the turkey, and put it to boil in 
cold water, with a spoonful of salt in it, and enough 
water to cover them well ; let it simmer for two hours 
and a half, or, if small, less time ; skim it while boU^ 
ing ; it looks nicer if wrapped in a cloth dredged with 
flour ; serve it with drawn butter, in which put some 
oysters. 

ROAST CHICKENS. 

Mrs. Jas. Beaty. 

Wash them cleau' outside and inside ; stuflT them as 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 77 

directed for turkeys ; baste them with butter, lard, or 
drippings, and roast them about an hour. Chickens 
should de cooked thoroughly. Stew the inwards till 
tender, and till there is but little water ; chop them and 
mix in gravy from the dripping-pan ; thicken with brown 
flour ; season with salt, pepper, and butter. Cranberry 
or new made apple sauce, is good with them. 

TO STEW BIRDS. 

Mrs. Jas. Beaty. 

Wash and stuff them with bread crumbs, seasoned 
with pepper, salt, butter or chopped salt pork, and fasten, 
them tight. Line a stew pan with slices of bacon, add a 
([uart of water and a bit of butter the size of a goose egg, 
•)r else four slices of salt pork. Add if you like sliced 
onions, and sweet herbs and mace. Stew till tender, then 
take them up and strain the gravy over them. Add boil- 
ing water if the liquor is too much reduced. 

ON THE PREPARATION OF HASHES, GRAVIES, 

AND SAUCES. 

Mrs. Jas. Beaty. 

There is nothing worse for the health, or for the palate, 
than a poor hash while a good hash is not only a 
favourite dish in most families, but an essential article 
of economy and convenience. For this reason a separate 
article is devoted to this subject. The following are the 
ways in which hashes are spoilt. The first is by cooking 
them. Meat, when once cooked, should only be heated. 
If it is again stewed or fried, it tends to make it hard or 



78 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

tough, and diminishes its flavour. The second is by fry- 
ing the butter or gravy in which they are prepared. It 
has been shown that this is very injurious to the health- 
fulness of food. Butter and oils may be melted without 
changing their nature, but when cooked, they become 
much more indigestible and injurious to weak stomachs. 
The third mode of injuring hashes is by putting in flour 
in such ways that it is not properly cooked. Flour 
dredged on to hashes while they are cooking imparts the 
raw taste of dough. The fourth mode is by putting in 
so much water as to make them vapid, or else so much 
grease as to make them gross. The fifth is by seasoning 
them with so little care, that they either have very little 
savory taste, or else are so hot with pepper and spice as to 
be unhealthy. If a housekeeper will follow these direc- 
tions, or give them to a cook who will follow them exactly, 
she will always have good and healthful hashes. 

TO CURRY CHICKEN 

Mrs. W. Arthurs. 

Slice an onion and brown in a little butter ; add a 
spoonful of curry powder ; allow it to remain covered 
for a few minutes to cook ; add a little more butter and 
put in chicken, veal, &c., &c. ; cut up small, thicken 
with a little flour. This is exellent. 

BAKED CHICKEN. 

Anonymous. 

Cut the fowls open and lay them flat in a pan, break- 
ing down the breast and the back bones ; dredge with 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 79 

flour and season well with salt and pepper, with bits of 
butter ; put in a very hot oven until done, basting fre- 
quently with melted butter ; or when half done take out 
the chicken and finish by broiling it upon a gridiron 
over bright coals ; pour over it melted butter and the 
juices in the pan in which it was baked. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE. 

Sarah Page. 

Cut up the chickens and put on the fire in a kettle 
with cold water sufiicient to cover, add a little salt or 
salt pork sliced, if you like ; boil until tender, and cut 
up and put in part of a head of celery. When tender 
have ready hot baking-powder biscuits broken open and 
laid on a platter ; on this place the chicken ; thicken 
the gravy with flour moistened with water or milk, and 
pour it over the chicken and biscuits. If you prefer, 
use a good-sized piece of butter to season instead of the 
salt pork. Oysters are an addition. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Mrs. Bausher. 

Cut the chicken in pieces, lay it in salt and water, 
which change several times ; roll each piece in flour ; 
fry in very hot lard or butter, season with salt and pep- 
per ; fry parsley with them also. Make a gravy of 
cream seasoned with salt, pepper and a little mace, 
thickened with a little flour in the pan in which the 
chickens were fried, pouring off the lard.

DRESSING FOR CHICKENS OR TURKEY. 

Mrs. F. D. 

Chop bread crumbs quite fine, season well with pep-

CURRY. 

Miss BrokovskL 

To make curry with rabbit, chicken, or any other 
meat, flour the meat and fry it a nice light brown ; fry 
also two large onions in the same way ; mix a table- 
spoonful of curry powder, and a small quantity of 
Cayenne in a tea cup, with warm water to the consistency 
of cream and cover every part of the meat with the 
mixture; have ready some nice stock or thin grav%"; 
put all together into a stew-pan, and let it stew gently 
for twenty minutes ; before serving slice two or three 
apples, let them stew away ; this addition is thought to 
be a great improvement, as it makes the curry milder ; 
rice to be boiled very dry and served around the dish,

JELLIED CHICKEN. 

M. A. T. 

Boil a fowl until it will slip easily from the bones ; let 
the water be reduced to about one pint in boiling ; pick 
the meat from the bones in good sized pieces, taking out 
aU gristle, fat, and bones ; place in a wet mould ; skim the 
fat from the liquor ; a little butter ; pepper and salt to 
the taste and one-half ounce of gelatine. When this dis- 
solves, pour it hot over the chicken. The liquor must bo 
seasoned pretty high, for the chicken absorbs. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Mrs. H. 

Stew chickens until tender ; line the sides of a deep pie 
dish with nice pastry ; put in the chicken, and the water 
in which it has boiled, (which should be but half a pint); 
season with a large piece of butter, salt and pepper, and 
then cover loosely with crust. While this is baking, 
have ready a quart can of fine oysters ; put on the fire a 
pint of rich milk, (or the liquor of the oysters will do) ; 
let it come to a boil ; thicken with a little fl^our, and 
season with butter, pepper and salt ; pour this over the 
oysters boiling hot, and about fifteen minutes before the 
pie is done, lift the crust and pour the oysters and all into 
the pie ; then return to the oven to finish.

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

Marion Haxland. 

Minced chicken ; about one-quarter as much fine bread 
crumbs as you have of meat ; one egg beaten light to 
each cup of meat ; gravy enough to moisten the crumbs 
and chicken ; or, if you have no gravy, a little drawn 
butter; pepper and salt and chopped parsley to taste; 
yolks of two hard boiled eggs rubbed fine with the back 
of a silver spoon, added to the meat ; mix up into a paste 
with as little handling as may be ; nor must the paste be 
too wet to mould readily ; make with floured hands into 
rolls or ovate balls, roll in flour until well coated, and 
fry a few at a time, lest crowding should injure the 
shape, in nice dripping, or a mixture half lard and half 
butter. As you take them out lay in a hot colander, 
that every drop of fat may be drained off. Serve in a 
heated dish with cresses or parsley.

pans and set in the oven a few minutes to brown very 
slightly. 

DUCKS. 

Miss S. P. 

When roasted, use dressing as for turkey, with the 
addition of a few slices of onion. Many cooks lay over 
the game slices of onions, which take away the fishy 
flavour, removing the onion before serving. Make a 
sauce with the drippings in the pan in which the game 
is roasted, and to which are put the chopped giblets, 
which are previously well cooked ; thicken the gravy with 
brown flour, moistened with water. Serve with currant 
jelly. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Stuff and roast in the same manner as ducks. Many 
cooks cover poultry with a paste of flour and water while 
baking, removing it before it is served.

TO ROAST WILD FOWL. 

M. A. T. 

Put an onion, salt and hot water into a pan, and baste 
for ten or fifteen minutes ; change the pan ; put in a slice 
of salt pork and baste with butter and pork drippings very 
often ; just before serving dredge lightly with flour and 
baste. Ducks take from twenty-five to thirty- five minutes 
to roast, and woodcock and snipe fifteen to twenty-five. 

Do not draw or take ofi" the heads of either. Garnish 
with fried or toasted bread, lemon, parsley, and currant 

jelly. . 

PRAIRIE CHICKENS, PARTRIDGES, AND QUAILS. 

Miss Sarah Page. 

Clean nicely, using a little soda in the water in which 
they are washed ; rinse and dry, then fill with dressing, 
sewing up nicely, binding down the legs and wings with 
cords. Put in a steamer over hot water, and let them 
cook until just done. Then place in a pan with a little 
butter ; set in the oven and baste frequently with melt- 
ed butter until of a nice brown. They ought to brown 
nicely in about fifteen minutes. Serve on a platter, with 
sprigs of parsley alternating with currant jeUy. 

QUAIL ON TOAST. 

After the birds are nicely cleaned, cut them open down 
the back ; salt and pepper them, and dredge with flour. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 85 

Break down the breast and back-bones, so they will lie flat, 
and place them in a pan with very little water and but- 
ter in a hot oven, covering them up tightly until nearly 
done. Then place in a spider in hot butter, and fry 
a moment to a nice brown. Have ready slices of baker's 
bread toasted, and slightly buttered upon a platter. The 
toast should be broken down with a carving knife, so that 
it will be tender. On this place the quail ; make a sauce 
of the gravy in the pan, thicken lightly with browned flour, 
and pour over each quail and the toast. 

A SUGGESTION. 

M. A. T. 

Singe all poultry with alcohol, and dip quails into clari- 
fied butter for broiling. 

PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Mrs. C. Belford- 

Cut up the fowls and pl;ace in a kettle with a tight cover, 
so as to retain the steam ; put about two teacups of water 
and plenty of salt and pepper over the chicken, then let 
it oook until the meat cleaves easily from the bones, cut 
or chop all the meat (freed from skin, bone and gristle) 
about as for chicken salad ; season well, put into a dish 
and pour the remnant of the juice in which it was cooked 
over it. This will jelly when cold, and can then be sliced 
or set on the table in shape. Nice for tea or lunch. The 
knack of making this simple dish is not having too much 
water ; it will not jelly if too weak, or if the water is 
allowed to boil away entirely while cooking. 



86 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

PIGEON PIE. 

Mrs. L. 

Make a fine puff paste ; lay a border of it around a large 
dish, and cover the bottom with a veal cutlet, or a very 
tender steak free from fat and bone ; season with salt, 
cayenne pepper, and mace. Prepare as many pigeons as 
can be put in one layer of the dish ; put in each pigeon a 
small lump of butter, and season with pepper and salt ; 
lay them in the dish breast downwards, and cut in slices 
a half dozen of hard boiled eggs, and lay in with the birds ; 
put in more butter, some veal broth, and cover the whi^lf* 
with crust. Bake slowly for an hour and a half. 

BROILED PIGEONS OR SQUABS. 

Marion Harland. 

Young pigeons or " squabs " are rightly esteemed a great 
delicacy. They are cleaned, washed, and dried carefully 
with a clean cloth ; then split down the back, and broil- 
ed like chickens. Season with pepper and salt, and 
butter liberally in dishing them. They are in great 
request in a convalescent's room, being peculiarly savory 
and nourishing. 



MEATS. 



— " Cook, see all your saucea 
Be sliarp and poignant in the palate, that they may 
Comm end you ; look to your roast and baked meats handsomely, 
And what new kickshaws and delicate made things." 

— Bkaduont asd Flztchkb. 

GENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEATS. 

All salt meat should be put on in cold water, that the 
ualt may be extracted while cooking. Fresh meat, which 
is boiled to be served with sauces at the table, should be 
put to cook in boiling water ; when the outer fibres con- 
tract, the inner j uices are preserved. 

For making soup, put the meat over in cold water, to 
extract the juices for the broth. 

In boiling meats, if more water is needed, add that 
which is hot, and be careful to keep the water on the 
meat constantly boiling. 

"Remove the scum when it first begins to boU. The 
more gently meat boils, the more tender it will become. 
AUow twenty minutes for boiling each pound of fiesh 
meat. 

Roast meats require a brisk fire. Baste often. Twenty 
minutes is required for roasting each pound of fresh 
meat. The variation in roasted meats consists simply 



88 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

in the method of preparing them to cook, before putting 
them in the oven. Some are to be larded, some stuffed 
with bread dressing, and others plain, only seasoning 
with pepper and salt. 

A piece of red pepper, cooked in a boiled dinner, is 
very nice. 

ROAST BEEF. 

Mrs. C. Belford. 

Prepare for the oven by dredging lightly with flour, 
and seasoning with salt and pepper ; place in the oven, 
and baste frequently while roasting. Allow a quarter 
of an hour for a pound of meat, if you like it rare ; 
longer if you like it well done. Serve with a sauce, 
made from the drippings in the pan, to which has been 
added a tablespoon of Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, 
and a tablespoon of tomato catsup. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Mrs. W. Gale. 

One ajad a half pints milk, six large tablespoonfuls 
flour, three eggs, one saltspoonful salt ; bake under the 
meat for one hour and a half. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Mrs. Joseph B. Leake.

ten minutes ; then put it under the roasting beef and 
leave it till you take up the beef ; leave it in about five 
minutes after you take up the beef ; then pour off the 
fat and send it to the table. 

BEEFSTEAK AND MUSHROOMS. 

Mrs. Perry H. Smith. 

Put in a saucepan, one ounce of butter, a small onion 
chopped fine, a little ground sage, and a little thyme, 
and put it over the fire ; wh«;n hot, shake in two table- 
spoons of floui', and when it becomes brown, put in one 
gill of water, and let it boil for half an hour. Then add 
three tablespoons of beef stock, a little salt, a little 
nutmeg and one wine glass of sherry wine. Put in one 
can of mushrooms, and let it boil for ten minutes. Pour 
this over a nicely broiled beefsteak. 

BROILED BEEFSTEAK. 

Lay a thick tender steak upon a gridiron over hot 
coals, having greased the bars with butter before the 
steak has been put upon it ; (a steel gridiron with slender 
bars is to be preferred, the broad flat iron bars of grid- 
irons commonly used fry and scorch the meat, impart- 
ing a disagreeable flavour). When done on one side, 
have ready your platter warmed with a little butter on 
it ; lay the steak upon the platter with the cooked side 
down, that the juices which have gathered may run on 
the platter, but do not press the meat ; then lay your 
beefsteak again upon the gridiron quickly and cook the 
other side. When done to your liking, put again on the 



90 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

platter, spread lightly with butter, place where it will keep 
warm for a few moments, but not to let the butter be- 
come oily, (over boiling steam is best) ; and then serve 
on hot plates. Beefsteak should never be seasoned with 
salt and pepper while cooking. If your meat is tough, 
pound well with a steak mallet on both sides. 

BEEF LOAF. 

Mrs. Carson. 

Three and a half pounds veal or beef, minced very fine, 
and uncooked ; four large crackers, crushed very fine ; 
one egg, one cup of milk, butter the size of an egg, one 
tablespoon salt, one of pepper ; mix in shape of a loaf, 
and bake in a slow oven two hours and a half, basting 
often ; to be eaten cold ; very nice for tea or lunch. 

BEEF EN MIROTON. 

Mrs. S. McMaster. 

Cut thin slices of cold roast beef, and put them into a 
frying pan with some butter and six onions, turn the 
pan frequently, then mix a little broth, add pepper and 
salt, and after a few boils serve up hot. 

BEEF WITH TOMATOES. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayer, 

Eight pounds fresh plate beef, second cut broiled ; boil 
tender two quarts tomatoes, three cloves, plenty butter, 
pepper and salt ; when cooked nicely and thick, strain 
through a colander and pour over your beef and serve hot 
or cold. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 91 

TO BOIL CORNED BEEF. 

Mrs. J. Beaty. 

Put the beef in water enough to cover it, and let it 
heat slowly, and boil slowly, and be careftil to take off 
the grease. Many think it much improved by boiling 
potatoes, turnips, and cabbages with it. In this case 
the vegetable must be pealed and all the grease care- 
fully skimmed as fast as it rises. Allow about twenty 
minutes of boiling for each pound of meat. 

BEEF OR VEAL STEWED WITH APPLES. 

Mis. James Beaty. 

Rub a stewpan with butter ; cut the meat in thin 
slices, and put in with pepper, salt, and apple, sliced 
fine; some would add a little onion. Cover it tight, 
and stew till tender. 

BEEFS HEART. 

Marion Harland. 

Wash the heart weU, and cut into squares half an inch 
long. Stew them for ten minutes in enough water to 
cover them. Salt the water slightly to draw out the 
blood, and throw it away as it rises in scum to the top. 
Take out the meat, strain the liquor, and return the chop- 
ped heart to it, with a sliced onion, a great spoonful of 
catsup, some parsley, a head of celery chopped fine, and 
cayenne pepper, with a large lump of butter. Stew un- 
til the meat is very tender, when add a tablespoonf ul of 
browned flour to thicken. Boil up once, and serve. 



DOMESTIC RECEIPTS. 



TO COOK A HAM (VERY FINE). 

Mrs. J. Beaty 

Boil a common-sized ham four or five hours, then 
skin the whole and fit it tor the table ; then set it in an 
oven for half an hour, then cover it thickly with pounded 
rusk or bread crumbs, and set it back for half an hour. 
Boiled ham is always improved by setting it into an 
oven for nearly an hour, till much of the fat fries out; 
and this also makes it more tender. 

TO BOIL A LEG OF VEAL OE MUTTON. 

Miss Kate Beaty. 

Make a stuffing of bread and a quarter as much of 
salt pork, chopped fine and seasoned with sweet herbs, 
pepper and salt. Make deep gashes, or, what is better, 
take out the bone with a carving-knife and fill up with 
stuffing, and sew up the opening with strong thread. 
When there is a flap of flesh lap it over the opening and 
sew it down. Put it into a large pot and fill it with 
water, putting in a tablespoonful of salt, and let it sim- 
mer slowly three hours. If it is needful to add water 
pour in boiling water. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 93 

SALLIE MUNDER'S WAY OF DRESSING COLD 
MEAT. 

Mince beef or mutton, small, with onions, pepper and 
gait ; add a little gravy, put into scallop shells or small 
cups, making them three parts full, and fill them up 
with potatoes mashed with a little cream, put a bit of 
butter on the top and brown them in an oven. 

BOILED BEEF (COLD). 

Madame E. Pemet. 

To use next day or when you like, for breakfast. 

Melt a good lump of butter, about two ounces, over a 
slow fire, into a tablespoonful of flour ; when it has 
simmered a little add some chopped onion (to taste) and 
a dessert spoonftd of chopped parsley ; when brown 
season with pepper and add a little stock gravy, or 
water ; mince the meat, put it in with the rest, and let 
it heat gradually ; when nearly boiling thicken with a 
teaspoonful of flour. Add a little catsup or sauce of 
any kind. 

A LA MODE BEEF. 

Miss Sarah Page. 

Take a piece of beef four or five inches thick, and 
with a knife make small holes entirely through it at 
slight distances apart. Then take strips of fat salt pork, 
roll them in pepper and cloves. Lay on a pan, cover 
closely, and put over in a steamer, and steam for three 
hours. When done, thicken the gravy in the pan with a 
little flour. This is excellent when eaten as cold meat.

Mrs. C. C. Stratton. 

Take the round of beefsteak, salt and pepper either 
side ; prepare bread or crackers with oysters or with- 
out, as for stuffing a turkey ; lay your stuffing on the 
meat ; sew up and roast about an hour ; and if you do 
not see the wings and legs you will think you have roast 
duck.

PRESERVED BEEF. 

Mrs. Carter. 

For pi eserving one hundred pounds beef : Six pounds 
salt, twc ounces salt-petre, two tablespoons soda, two 
pounds sugar, four gallons water ; mix well together ; 
sprinkle the bottom of the barrel with salt ; put in the 
beef with, very little salt between each layer ; pour over 
the brine and put on a weight to keep all well covered. 

TO CORN BEEF. 

Mrs. A, M. Gibbs. 

To each gallon of cold water, put one quart of rock 
salt, one ounce of salt-petre and four ounces of brown 
sugar, (it need not be boiled), as long as any salt remains 
undissolved, the meat will be sweet. If any scum should 
rise, scald and skim well ; add more salt, salt-petre and 
sugar ; as you put each piece of meat into the brine, rub 
over with salt. If the weather is hot, gash the meat to 
the bone, and put it in salt. Put a flat stone or some 
weight on the meat to keep it under the brine. 

Or this : To every four gallons of water allow two 
pounds of brown sugar and six pounds of salt, boil about 
twenty minutes, taking ofi" the scum ; the next day turn 
it on the meat packed in the pickling tub ; pour off this 
brine ; boil and strain every two months, adding three 
ounces of brown sugar and half a pound of common salt,. 
It will keep good a year. Sprinkle the meat with salt 
the next day, wipe dry before turning the pickle over it. 
Let it entirely cover the meat ; add four ounces salt-petre. 
Canvas lids are excellent for covering, as they admit the

fine, one tablespoon of salt and one of pepper, one-half 
of a nutmeg, four or five rolled crackers, three eggs. If 
the veal is thin, add a piece of butter half as large as an 
egg, and a tablespoon of cream. Form all this in a large 
roll, and spot the roll over with bits of butter ; then strew 
over it the pounded crackers, (a little of the cracker sliould 
be mixed with the meat), put it in the oven, and from 
time to time add a little water. Cook slowly two hours. 
When cold, slice thin, and it makes an excellent relish. 

SWEET BREADS. 

Scald in salt and water, take out the stringy parts ; then 
put in cold water a few minutes ; dry in a towel ; dip 
in an egg and bread crumbs, and fry brown in butter ;

OXFORD SAUSAGE. 

M. A, Sadler. 

Take one pound of young pork, fat and lean, without 
skin or gristle, one pound of lean veal, one pound of beef 
suet chopped very fine together. Put in half a pound of 
bread crumbs, six sage leaves, a teaspoon of pepper and 
two of salt, some thyme, marjoram and savoury shred fine. 
Mix well together. 

SAUSAGES. 

Mn. C. Bradley and othera. 

Six pounds of lean fresh pork, twelve teaspoons of sage, 
and six teaspoons of pepper, six teaspoons of salt, (and 
two of cloves, and one nutmeg, if you prefer), grind or 
chop very fine ; mix these ingredients thoroughly, and 
pack in a jar, and pour hot lard over the top. 

HAM SANDWICHES. 

Mrs. W. Butterfield. 

Chop fine some cold boiled ham, a little fat with the 
lean • add tongue and chicken also chopped fine ; make 



106 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

a dressing of one-half a pound of butter, three tablespoons 
of salad oil, three of mustard, the yolk of one egg, and a 
little salt ; mix well together and spread over the meat 
smoothly on thin slices of bread. Very nice. 

TRAVELLING LUNCH, 

Mrs. J. L. B. 

Chop sardines, ham, and a few pickles quite fine ; mix 
with mustard, pepper, catsup, salt, and vinegar ; spread 
between bread nicely buttered. This ia to be cut cross- 
wise, like jelly cake. 

BAKED HAM. 

Mrs. W. G. Davis. 

Most persons boil ham. It is much better baked, if 
baked right. Soak it for an hour in clean water and 
wipe it dry, next spread it all over with thin batter, and 
then put it into a deep dish with sticks under it to keep 
it out of the gravy. When it is fully done and the bat- 
ter crusted on the flesh side, take off the skin and set it 
away to cool. 

BOILED HAM 

Mrs. C. Waggoner. 

Take a ham weighing about eight or ten pounds ; soak 
it for twelve or twenty-four hours in cold water ; then 
cover it with boiling water, add one pint of vinegar, two 
or three bay-leaves, a little bunch of thyme and parsley, 
(the dried and sifted will do, or even the seeds of parsley 
may be used, if the fresh cannot be procured) ; boil very

slowly two hours and a half, take it out, skim it, remove 
all the fat, except a l&yeT half an inch thick ; cut off with 
a sharp knife all the black-looking outside ; put the ham 
into your dripping pan, fat side uppermost, grate bread 
crust over it and sprinkle a teaspoon of powdered sugar 
over it ; put it in the oven for half an hour, until it is a 
beautiful brown. Eat cold; cut the nicest portion in 
slices ; the ragged parts and odds and ends can be 
chopped fine and used for sandwiches; or, by adding 
three eggs to one pint of chopped ham, and frying brown, 
you have a delicious omelette for breakfast or lunch. The 
bones should be put in a soup-kettle, the rind and fat 
should be rendered and strained for frying potatoes and 
crullers. Ham cooked in this way will go much farther 
than when cooked in the ordinary manner. 

BOILED AND BAKED HAM, 

Mrs, P. B. Ayer, 

Boil your ham tender ; cover it with the white of a raw 
eorg, and sprinkle sugar or bread crumbs over it ; put it 
in the oven and brown ; it is delicious also covered with 
a resrular cake icincr and browned. 

TO BOIL A HAM. 

M. 

Wash and scrape the ham clean ; put it on in cold 
water enough to cover it ; put into the water two onions, 
two carrots, a head of celery, a dozen cloves and a hand- 
ful of timothy hay ; boil without stopping until the skin 
will readily peel from the ham j cover the ham with iplle4

crackers, or bread crumbs that have been browned and 
rolled, and bake in a slow oven for two hours. 

SALTING PORK. 

A. M. G. 

Cover the bottom of the barrel with salt an inch deep ; 
put down one layer of pork and cover that with salt half 
an inch thick ; continue this until all your pork is disposed 
of ; then cover the whole with strong brine ; pack as 
tight as possible, the rind side down or next to the barrel ; 
keep the pork always under the brine by using an inner 
cover and clean stones. Should any scum arise, pour 
off the brine, scald it, and add more salt. Old brine can 
be boiled down, well skimmed, and used for a ii-esh supply. 

CURING HAMS. 

Mrs. Mulford. 

Hang up the hams a week or ten days, the longer the 
tenderer and better, if kept perfectly sweet; mix for 
each good-sized ham, one teacup of salt, one tablespoon 
of molasses, one ounce of salt-petre ; lay the hams in a 
clean dry tub ; heat the mixture and rub weU into the 
hams, especially around the bones and recesses ; repeat 
the process once or twice, until all the mixture is 
used ; then let the hams lie two or three days, when 
they must be put for three weeks in brine strong enough 
to bear an egg ; then soak eight hours in cold water ; 
hano- up to dry in the kitchen or other more convenient 
place for a week or more ; smoke from three to five 
days, being careful not to heat the hams. Corn cobs 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 109 

and apple-tree wood are good for smoking^. The juices 
are better retained if smoked with the hock down. Tie 
up carefully in bags for the summer. 



SALADS, SAUCES, AND PICKLES. 



" To make tliis condiment, your poet begs 
The powdered yellow of two hard-boiled eggs ; 
Two boiled potatoes, passed through the kitchen lieTt^ 
Smoothness and softness to the salad give ; 
I/et onions atoms lurk within the bowl, 
And, half suspected, animate the whole ; 
Of mordant mustard, add a single spoon ; 
Distrust the condiment that bites so soon ; 
But, deem it not, thou man of herbs, a fault 
To add a double quantity of salt ; 
Four times the spoon with oU from Lucca crown. 
And twice with vinegar, procured from to%vn ; 
And lastly, o'er the flavoured compound toss 
A magic toxipcon of anchovy sauce.

Twould tempt the dying anchorite to eat ; 
Back to the world he'd turn his fleeting soul. 
And plunge his fingers in the salad bowl ;

SAUCER FOR MEAT OR FISH. 



DRAWN BUTTER. 

Drawn butter forms the basis of most sauces. From 
this a great variety may be made, by adding to this dif- 
ferent flavours — anchovies, ochra, onions, celery, par- 
sley, mint, and relishes — using those flavours, which are 
suitable for the meat, game, or fish, with which the sauces 
are to be served. A good standard receipt for drawn but- 
ter is as follows : 

Rub one tablespoon of flour with one-quarter of a 
pound of butter ; when weU mixed, put in a saucepan 
with a tablespoon of milk or water ; set in a dish of 
boiling water, shaking it well until the butter melts and 
is near boiling. It should not be set directly on the 
stove or over the coals, as the heat will make the butter 
oily and spoil it.

128 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

green beans cut one inch long, one quart green tomatoes 
sliced ; put this mixture in a pretty strong brine twenty- 
four hours ; drain three hours, then sprinkle in one- 
fourth pound black and one-fourth pound of white mustard 
seed ; also one tablespoon black ground pepper ; let it 
come to a good boil in just vinegar enough to cover it, 
adding a little alum. Drain again, and when cold, mix 
in one-half pint of ground mustard ; cover the whole 
with good cider vinegar ; add turmeric enough to colour, 
if you like. 

PICKLED CABBAGE. 

Mrs. A. N. Arnold. 

Select solid heads, slice very fine, put in a jar, then 
cover with boiling water ; when cold, drain oft' the water, 
and season with grated horse-radish, salt, equal parts 
of black and red pepper, cinnamon, and cloves whole ; 
cover with strong vinegar. This is convenient and always 
good. 

INDIA PICKLE. 

Mrs. George Simpson. 

Take three quarts vinegar, quarter pound mustard, half 
ounce black pepper, one ounce cloves, one ounce allspice, 
one ounce turmeric, one ounce ginger, one ounce cayenne 
pepper, handful salt, same of sugar ; boil for twenty min- 
utes. When cold put in the vegetables and cover closely ; 
if the liquid should become thin, boil again and add more 
mustard in three weeks after making. 



VALUABLE RECIPIS. 129 

TOMATO MUSTARD. 

Mrs. Gr«org8 Simpson. 

Slice and boil for an hour, with six small red peppers, 
half bushel of ripe tomatoes strain through a colander 
and boil for an hour, with two tablespoonsful of black 
pepper, two ounces ginger, one ounce allspice, half ounce 
cloves, one-eighth ounce mace, quarter pound salt. When 
cold add two ounces mustard, two ounces currie powder, 
and one pint of vinegar. 

PICKLED CAULIFLOWER 

After cutting off all the green leaves, put the cauli- 
flower into boiling water, with a good supply of salt, 
and boil from three to five minutes ; take them out of 
the salt and water, dip them in clear cold water one 
minute to send the heat to the heart of the cauliflower, 
cut them in pieces convenient to put in jars, then make 
a mixture of one tablespoonful of mace, one of cloves, one 
of allspice, one of ginger, two of white mustard seed, 
and a red pepper pod; with each a gallon of vinegar. 
Let the mixture boU and pour it upon the cauliflower ; 
cover it closely and let it stand one week ; then pour 
off the vinegar, scald it, and return it hot again to the 
cauliflower ; then put it in jars ready for use. The best 
cider vinegar should be used, and if it is not perfectly 
clear it will dissolve the cauliflower. 

PICKLES. 

Mre. H. Baird. 

Slice one peck green tomatoes, and one quart small

white onions, each in a separate dish, with a small tea- 
cup of salt on them ; to stand over night. Drain well, 
then take two quarts vinegar, one pound brown sugar, a 
few pepper pods, capsicums, some mace and ginger root, 
and put all together and simmer until tender. A very 
nice pickle. 

ANOTHER GOOD PICKLE. 

Two quarts small cucumbers, one quart small onions, 
two small cauliflowers, one quart beans ; let them lie 
over-night, with a small teacup of salt in a gallon of 
water ; in the morning put them on the stove and let 
them come to a scald, then take out and let them cool. 
To two quarts of vinegar put one ounce of curry powder, 
one ounce turmeric, one ounce ground ginger, two 
ounces mustard, one teaspoon cayenne pepper, two or 
three tablespoons salad oil ; mix all together, and let it 
just come to a boil and pour over the vegetables. 

FRENCH TOMATO PICKLE. 

One peck green tomatoes, six onions nicely sliced; 
sprinkle one teacup salt over and stand all night ; then 
drain well and scald in weak vinegar ten or fifteen 
minutes ; drain again and scald with two quarts strong 
vinegar, one pound sugar, two tablespoons curry powder, 
two tablespoons turmeric, two teaspoons cinnamon, two 
teaspoons cloves, two teaspoons allspice, two teaspoons 
mustard ; simmer ^all together slowly a few minutes. It 
is a beautiful rich pickle.

SPICED TOMATOES. 

Mrs. Stotesbury. 

To four pounds of large red tomatoes, take two pounds 
of good brown sugar, one pint of eider vinegar, half ounce 
of cloves, and half ounce of stick cinnamon ; stew 
all together in a preserving kettle until the tomatoes are 
cooked ; take the tomatoes out and put them on dishes 
to cool, letting the syrup go on simmering slowly ; when 
the tomatoes are cold return them to the syrup for a little 
while ; let them become cold before putting them in the 
jars. The syrup must be boiled down as thick as 
molasses, and poured cold over the tomatoes ; tie them 
down with bladder or waxed paper. 

PICKLED CUCUMBERa 

Mi8. Packard. 

Wash with care your cucumbers, and place in jars. 
Make a weak brine (a handful of salt to a gallon and a 
half of water). When scalding hot, turn over the cucum- 
bers and cover ; repeat this process three mornings in 
succession, taking care to skim thoroughly. On the 
fourth day have ready a porcelain kettle of vinegar, to 
which has been added a piece of alum the size of a wal- 
nut. When scalding hot, put in as many cucumbers as 
may be covered with the vinegar ; do not let them boil, 
but skim off as soon as scalded through, and replace 
with others, adding each time a small piece of alum. 
When this process is through, throw out the vinegar and 
replace with good cider or white wine vinegar; add 
spices, mustard seed, and red peppers. Sort the pickles 



132 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

and place in stone or glass jars, turn over the hot spiced 
vinegar ; seal and put away the jars' not needed for 
immediate use. Pickles thus prepared are fine and crisp 
at the expiration of a year. Those that are kept in open- 
mouth jars may be covered with a cloth, which ■will need 
to be taken off and rinsed occasionally. I prefer green 
peppers, and prepare them with cucumbers in brine. 
They are not as apt to become soft. 

DRESSING SALAD. 

Mrs. Riley. 

In dressing salad it should be thoroughly saturated 
with oil, and seasoned with salt and pepper before vin- 
egar is added. The salt should not be dissolved in the 
vinegar but in the oil, by which means it is more equally 
distributed through the salad. 

CUCUMBERS FOR PRESENT USE. 

Mrs. Riley. 

The best way of utilising cucumbers for 'present use 
is to parboil them in a solution of water, vinegar, and 
salt. They should be split in two before boiling, and, 
if done properly, will present a beautiful green colour. 

TOMATO MUSTARD. 

Mrs. Spaulding. 

One peck of tomatoes, ripe, half-pound salt, six red 
peppers, three tablespoonsful of black pepper, one ounce 
ginger, one ounce allspice, half ounce mace, half ounce

pound mustard, a tablespoonful of red peppers, and a 
half pint vinegar. Peel the tomatoes, and boil an hour 
with six red peppers ; then add the other spices (ex- 
cepting the mustard and vinegar, which are added after 
the sauce is strained through a colander and cooled), 
and boil another hour. 

WORCESTER SAUCE.

preserving pan half an hour ; pulp it through a colander 
and return to kettle with the following : one dessert 
spoon of cloves, (ground spices), one of allspice, one of 
black pepper, one of ginger, one of cayenne, a little gar- 
lic, some onions, and a little curry powder. Let it 
boil down considerably, then strain through a sieve and 
add flour of mustard, until the proper thickness is ob- 
tained, and simmer for a short time ; then bottle for use. 

TOMATO CATSUP.

these plentifully and let stand twenty-four hours, and 
then drain well ; mix half a cup of grated horse-radish 
root with half an ounce of turmeric, (get at drug store), 
half an ounce of each of ground cinnamon and cloves, 
one ounce of ground pepper, one pint of ground mustard 
seed, one pint of brown sugar, two bunches of chopped 
celery. Put this mixture into a porcelain kettle in lay- 
ers with the vegetables. Cover with cold cider vinecrar, 
and boil slowly for two hours. The turmeric gives the 
pickles the yellow colour peculiar to East India pickles, 
and in taste and appearance they cannot be distinguished 
from the genuine. 

MRS. ELLAS'S CHOW CHOW. 

Two quarts tomatoes, two white onions, half dozen 
green peppers, one dozen cucumbers, two heads of cab- 
bage, all chopped fine ; let this stand over night ;

Miss Beaty. 

Rub in two teaspoonsful of flour into a quarter of a 
pound of butter ; add five tablespoonsful of cold wat^r ; 
set it into boiling water and let it melt, and heat until 
it begins to simmer, and it is done. Never simmer it 



136 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

on coals, as it fries the oil and spoils it. Be careful not 
to have the flour in lumps. If it is to be used with fish, 
put in chopped eggs and nasturtium, or capers. If used 
with boiled fowl, put in oysters while it is simmering. 
and let them heat through. 

BURNT BUTTER FOR FISH OR EGGS. 

Miss Beaty. 

Heat two ounces of butter in a frying-pan till a dark 
brown, then add a tablespoonful of vinegar, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and half a dozen shakes from the pepper- 
box. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Miss Beaty. 

Pour boiling water on the tomatoes ; let them stand 
until you can rub off the skin, then cover them with 
salt and let them stand twenty-four hours. Then strain 
them, and to two quarts put three ounces of cloves, two 
ounces of pepper and two nutmegs. Boil half an hour, 
then add a pint of wine. 

CURRIED DISHES. 

Miss Beaty. 

Chickens and veal are most suitable for curries. Boil 
the meat till tender, and separate the joint. Put a 
little butter in a stew-pan with the chickens, pour on a 
pai-t of the liquor in which the meat was boiled, enough 
to cover it and let it stew twenty minutes more. Pre- 
pare the curry thus ; for four pounds of meat take a

fcablespoonful of curry powder, a teacup of boiled rice, 
and a tablespoonful of flour and another of melted but- 
ter, a teacup of the liquor and half a teaspoonful of salt ; 
mix them, and pour them over the meat, and let stew 
ten minute more. Rice should be boiled for an accom- 
paniment. 

RIPE TQMATO PICKLES. 

Mrt(. C. M. Dickerman. 

To seven pounds of ripe tomatoes add three pounds 
sugar, one quart vinegar, boil them together fifteen min- 
utes, skim out the tomatoes and boil the syrup a few 
minutes longer. Spice to suit the taste with cloves and 
cinnamon. 

PICCALILLI. 

Mrs. Lamkin. 

One peck of green tomatoes ; (if the flavour of onions 
is desired, take eight, but it is very nice without any)» 
four green peppers ; slice all, and put in layers, sprinkle 
on one cup of salt, and let them remain over night ; 
in the morning press dry through a sieve, put it in a 
porcelain kettle and cover with vinegar ; add one cup of 
sugar, a tablespoon of each kind of spice ; put into a 
muslin bag ; stew slowly about an hour, or until the 
tomatoes are as soft as you desire. 

TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS BROWN. 

Miss Brokovski. 

Take the small buttons and rub them very clean with

a flannel, and some vinegar ; then put them in a dish 
with a little salt over them to draw the liquor from them, 
then put them into a kettle to stew very gently in their 
own liquor ; boil them in good vinegar, with mace, cloves, 
and black pepper. 

TOMATOES WHOLE FOR WINTER USE. 

Mrs. J. Saulter. 

Fill a large stone jar with ripe tomatoes, .then add a 
few whole cloves and a little sugar ; cover the^ well 
with one half cold vinegar and half water ; place a piece 
of flannel over the jar well down into the vinegar, then 
tie down with paper. I have kept tomatoes in this way 
the year round, and can cheerfully recommend them. 
Should mildew collect on the flannel it will not injure 
the tomatoes in the least. 

CHOW-CHOW. 

Mrs. John Corthell, 

Two heads cabbage, two heads cauliflower, one dozen 
cucumbers, six roots of celery, six peppers, one quart of 
small white onions, two quarts green tomatoes ; cut into 
small pieces, and boil each vegetable separately until 
tender, then strain them. Two gallons of vinegar, one- 
fourth pound of mustard, one-fourth pound of mustard 
seed, one pot of French mustard, one ounce of cloves, 
two ounces of turmeric ; put the vinegar and spices into 
a kettle and let them come to a boil ; mix the vegetables 
and pour over the dressing.

'Mm. Carl Hammond. 

Wash the oysters and scald them in strong salt and 
water ; skim them out and throw into cold water ; scald 
vinegar well and whole peppers ; let it get cold. Put 
the oysters in a stone jar ; make liquor to cover them of 
wat^r they were scalded in, and vinegar. A cup of vin- 
egar to one quart liquor, to be used cold. 

BRINE THAT PRESERVES BUTTER A YEAR. 

Mis. D. McCnmey. 

To three crallons of brine, stroncr enougrh to bear an e^g, 
add one-quarter pound good loaf sugar, and one tablespoon- 
f ul of saltpetre ; boil the brine, and when it is cold strain 
carefully. Pack butter closely in small jars, and allow the 
brine to cover the butter to the depth of at least four 
inches. This completely excludes the air. If practicable 
make your butter into small rolls, wrap each carefully 
in a clean muslin cloth, tying up with a string ; place a 
weight over the butter to keep it all submerged in the 
brine. This mode is most recommended by those who 
have tried both.

way, keeping the milk at nearly boiling heat ; it is bet- 
ter to spread the butter on the bread after it is dipped 
in hot milk, than to melt it in the milk ; thicken what 
milk is left with a little com starch, and pour over the 
toast when sent to the table. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS.

melted butter hot to fry a nice delicate brown ; take the 
whites of the six eggs, and beat them to a froth, adding 
a large cup of white sugar ; add the juice of two lemons, 
heating well, and adding two cups boiling water ; serve 
over the toast as a sauce, and you will find it a very 
delicious dish.

tender and chopped fine ; one-third more potatoes wlien 
chopped than meat ; three large onions sliced fine and 
browned in butter, and when tender, add the meat and 
potatoes, well seasoned with salt and pepper ; enough 
water to moisten. A small red pepper chopped fine is a 
great improvement. It is good without onions also. 

BREAKFAST STEAK. 

A ruce steak of beef or veal ; pound it with a steak 
mallet, if tough ; lay in a baking tin, dredge it lightly 
with flour, season with salt and pepper, and, if you like,

Mince cold beef or lamb ; if beef put in a pinch of pul- 
verized cloves ; if lamb, a pinch of summer savoury to 
season it, very little pepper and some salt, and put it in 
a baking dish ; mash potatoes and mix them with cream 
and butter and a little salt, and spread them over the 
meat ; beat up an egg with cream or milk, a very little ; 
spread it over the potatoes, and bake it a short time, 
sufficient to warm it through and brown the potatoes. 

POTATO PUFFS. 

S. S. Pierce. 

Take cold roast meat (either beef, veal or mutton) ; 
clear it from gristle ; chop fine ; season with pepper and 
salt ; boil and mash some potatoes, and make them into 
a paste with one or two eggs ; roll it out with a little 
flour ; cut it round with a saucer ; put your seasoned 
meat on one-half; fold it over like a puflf; turn it neatly 
round, and fry it a light brown. Nice for breakfast.

together ; add sweet milk until it is about the consistency 
of sponge cake or thick cream, and just before baking 
stir in lightly the beaten white of the egg. The less flour 
used the better for invalids. 

VEAL STEW. 

Two pounds of veal steak cut in strips ; put in cold 
water in a skillet or spider and over the fire. The water 
should be just sufficient to cover the meat. Pare, wash 
and slice one small potato and put in with the meat. 
Stew for twenty or thirty minutes gently, taking care 
that the water does not boil away. Have ready two or 
three eggs boiled in the shell. When the meat is tender 
add to the broth one cup of fresh milk and one heaping 
tablespoon of flour wet with milk ; season all with butter, 
salt and pepper, and, if you like, a little parsley. Cut 
the hard boiled eggs in slices and put into the broth. 
Let all boil up once, and serve with or without toast on 
the platter. A very nice breakfast dish.

Mrs. L. M. Angle. 

Break six or seven eggs into a buttered dish, taking 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 147 

care that each is whole, and does not encroach upon the 
others so much as to mix or disturb the yolks ; sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, and put a bit of butter upon each. 
Put into an oven and bake until the whites are set. 
This is far superior to fried eggs, and very nice for 
breakfast, served on toast or alone. 

POACHED EGGS. 

» Break as many eggs as you wish to use, one at a time, 
and drop carefully into a spider filled with boiling water. 
When the whites of the eggs are well set, slip a spoon 
carefully under and take out, laying each upon a small 
piece of buttered toast on the platter. Put a very small 
piece of butter on each egg, a slight dash of pepper, and 
serve immediately.

six eggs well beaten ; mix thoroughly ; and lastly, add the 
six whites cut to a stiff froth ; mix lightly and fiy with 
hot butter ; this will make two ; when almost done, turn 
together in shape of half moon.

edge, and with your spoon or hand draw the curd to the 
upper side, pressing out as much water as possible ; if 
desired, it can stand a few moments in cold water ;

BOILED POTATOES. 

Old potatoes are better for being peeled and put in 
cold water an hour before being put over to boil. They 
should then be put into fresh cold wat^r, when set over 
the fire.*" New potatoes should always be put into boiling 
water, and it is best to prepare them just in time for 
cooking. Are better steamed than boiled. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

jMrs. r. D. J. 

Peel the potatoes, and let them stand in cold water 
for half an hour ; then put in the steamer over boiling 
water and cook them until mealy and quite tender. Have 
ready an earthen basin, or a bright tin pan, into which 
you will put your potatoes, so that while mashing and 
preparing, they can be kept on the stove and hot. Now 
mash well and finely with the potatoe-masher, and then 
season with salt ; allow a generous piece of butter, and 
lastly, add a tea cup of rich milk ; mix altogether well, 
and then take up on a deep dish. 

There will now be three or four ways to finial' this, 



156 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

and which are, first by putting a little butter on the top, 
after smoothing nicely, and putting it a moment at the 
mouth of the oven, and then serving quite hot ; or you 
may put it into the oven, which should be quick and hot, 
and bake the crust of a rich brown. Or, again, the top 
may be scored a golden brown with steel bars made for 
this purpose. Or, lastly, after mashing the potato, put 
it into a mould and shape it ; then loosen it from the 
mould and turn it on to a flat piece of sheet iron, large 
enough to cover the bottom of the mould with handles 
at the sides. Then have ready hot lard in which you 
immerse the moulded potato and fry a rich golden brown. 
Take out and with a knife under, slide carefully on your 
platter. Garnish the dish around with curled parsley 
leaves. If the potato is put in the oven to brown, it 
should be put in a baking plate and may be sent to the 
table in the dish in which it is baked, with a knitted 
cover over. 

FRENCH POTATOES. 

Mrs. W. G. Davis. 

Peel and cut some potatoes in slices lengthwise, wipe 
dry and drop them in boiling lard ; serve very hot. 

POTATOES AND CREAM. 

Mince cold boiled potatoes tine ; put them into a spider 
with melted butter in it ; let them fry a little in tha 
butter well covered ; then put in a fresh piece of buttei, 
season with salt and pepper, and pour over cream or rich 
milk i let it boil up once and serve. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 157 

POTATOES FRIED. 

Mrs. A. 

Pare potatoes ; cut in pieces one-half inch wide, and 
as long as the potato ; keep them in cold water till 
wanted ; drop in boiling lard ; when nearly done, take 
them out with a skimmer and drain them; boil up the 
lard again, and drop them back, and fry tLU done ; this 
makes them puff up ; sprinkle with salt and serve very 
hot. 

POTATO CROQCTETTES. 

Take finely mashed potato and mix through it sufficient 
salt, pepper, and butter to season well, with sweet milk 
or cream to moisten; mix thoroughly with this one 
beaten egg, and then make up into small rolls, being 
careful to have the surface perfectly smooth. Have 
ready one plate with a beaten egg upon it, and another 
with cracker crumbs. Dip each roU into the egg and 
then into the crumbs, and fry of a rich golden brown in 
hot lard. Lay the croquettes on brown paper first, and 
serve on a napkin. 

PARSNIPS. 

Boil until tender in a little salted water; then take 
up ; skim them, cut in strips, dip in beaten egg, and fry 
in melted butter or hot lard. 

TIJRNIPa 

Boil until tender ; mash and season with butter, pepper, 
salt, and a little rich milk or cream. Serve with mutton. 



158 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

BEETS. 

Clean these nicely, but do not pare them, leaving on 
a short piece of the stalk. Then put over to boil in hot 
water. Young beets will cook tender in an hour ; old 
beets require several hours boiling. When done, skin 
quickly while hot; slice thin into your vegetable dish, 
put on salt, pepper and a little butter ; put over a little 
vinegar and serve hot or cold. 

BAKED SQUASH. 

Cut in pieces, scrape well, bake from one to one and 
a-half hours, according to the thickness of the squash ; 
to be eaten with salt and butter as sweet potatoes. 

FKIED SQUASHES. 

Mrs. F. M. Cragin. 

Cut the squash into thin slices, and sprinkle it with 
salt ; let it stand a few moments ; then beat two eggs, 
and dip the squash into the egg ; then fry it brown in 
butter. • 

SUMMER SQUASHES. 

Cook them whole ; when tender, if large, skin and 
remove the seeds ; if small, this will not be necessary ; 
drain and press the water out with a plate ; then put 
them in a stew-pan, and season well with butter, pepper, 
and salt, and a tablespoon of cream. 

GREEN CORN— BOILED.

water, slightly salted and boil thirty minutes. Serve 
in a napkin. 

GREEN CORN OYSTERS. 

To a pint of grated com add two well beaten eggs; 
one-half cup of cream, and a half cup of flour, with one- 
half spoon of baking powder stirred in it ; season with 
pepper and salt and fry in butter, dropping the batter 
in spoonsful ; serve a few at a time, very hot, as a relish 
with meats. 

GREEN CORN PATTIES. 

M. 

Grate as much com as will make one pint ; one teacup 
flour, one teacup butter, one egg, pepper and salt to taste. 
If too thick, add a little mUk, and fry in butter. 

SOUTHERN WAY OF BOILING RICE. 

Mrs. Stotesbury. 

Pick over the rice ; rinse it in cold water until perfectly 
clean, then put it in a pot of boiling water, allowing a 
quart of water to less than a teacup of rice ; boil it hard 
seventeen minutes ; drain off" the water very close, and 
let it steam fifteen minutes with the lid off". When care- 
fully done in this way, each kernel of rice stands out by 
itself, while it is perfectly tender. The water in which 
the rice has been boiled makes, it is said, good starch for 
muslin, if boiled a few minutes by itself. 



160 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

CORN OYSTERS. 

Mrs. Samuel McMaster, 

One pint of green grated com, two tablespoons of 
milk, three eggs, two tablespoons butter ; flour to make 
a batter, and fry on griddle with butter.

or two of fat salt pork ; put the beans in the baking-pan ; 
score the pork across the top, and settle in the middle ; 
add two tablespoons of sugar or molasses, and bake in a 
moderate oven two hours ; they should be very moist 
when first put into the oven, or they will grow too dry 
in baking. Do not forget the sweetening if you want 
Yankee baked beans. 

GREEN PEAS. 

Shell and put into boiling water, cook from thirty to 
thirty -five minutes ; drain and season with rich milk or 
cream, butter, pepper, and salt ; some cooks also add a 
little flour or corn starch to thicken the gravy, but which

should be used very sparingly, not more tban a teaspoon. 
Be sure the peas are young ; old peas are fit for nothing 
but soup. 

ASPARAGUS. 

Out off the green ends, and chop up the remainder of 
the stalks ; bod until tender, and season with salt and 
pepper ; have ready some toasted bread in a deep dish ; 
mix together equal parts of flour and butter to a cream ; 
add to this slowly enough of the asparagus water or 
clear hot water to make a sauce ; boil this up once ; put 
the asparagus on the toast and pour over all the sauce. 

BAKED CABBAGE.

CAULIFLOWER. 

Mrs. 0. Belford. 

Remove the leaves ; cut the main stock close to the 
flower ; lay it in boiling milk and water slightly salted, 
with the stalk down ; when done, take out carefully and 
drain in a colander, then place in the vegetable dish 
and pour over it a rich drawn butter dressing. 

ESCALOPED TOMATOES. 

Put into an earthen baking dish a layer of cracker 
crumbs and small bits of butter ; then a layer of tomatoes 
with a very little sugar sprinkled over them, then another 
layer of cracker crumbs seasoned with butter, and a layer 
of tomatoes, until your dish is full, with the cracker 
crumbs at the top ; pour over all this a little water to 
moisten, and bake half an hour. 

STEWED TOMATOES. 

Mrs. Saulter. 

Put ripe tomatoes into hot water and skin them ; then 
throw them into an earthen stew pan, (a new tin will 
do, but not so good) ; cut up and let the tomatoes cook 
gently a few minutes ; season with butter, pepper, salt, 
and serve. Or you may add bread crumbs and sugar 
to the tomatoes if preferred. Some cooks stew tomatoes 
for a long time, but the flavour is finer if allowed to sim- 
mer but a few moments, just sufticient time to heat well 
through. 



VALUABLE KECIPES. 163 

BAKED TOMATOEa 

Wash, wipe and then cut in two ; place them in a

fully when done, and put bits of butter on each piece of 
tomato. 

FRIED TOMATOES. 

Cut a large Feejee tomato in half, flour the cut side, 
heat very hot, and put the floured side down; when 
brown on one side, turn ; when done, pour over a teacup

Throw one pound of macaroni into a preserving kettle 



164 THE HOMB COOK BOOK. 

half filled with boiling water, (be sure that the water is 
boiling), and a small teaspoon of salt. Let it boil for about 
twenty minutes, or until it is tender ; then drain in a col- 
ander before putting on a dish. Have about two table- 
spoons of cheese grated and sprinkle over it, then pour 
over a tomato sauce which has been strained, and made 
as follows : Two hours before the macaroni is put on 
the fire, take a quart of canned or fresh tomatoes, and 
put in a saucepan with a little salt and pepper, half a 
small onion, a teaspoon of parsley cut fine, a piece of lard 
the size of an egg. Let it boil slowly for two hours ; if 
it gets too dry add a few spoonsful of water. 

ONIONS— BOILED. 

Select those of uniform size ; remove the outer skin, 
then boil until tender in a large quantity of milk and 
water ; the flavour will be more delicate. Drain them 
when tender, and season with butter, salt, and pepper. 

ONIONS— FRIED. 

Peel and slice and fry in lard or butter ; season with 
pepper and salt, and serve hot. 

MUSHROOMS— FRIED. 

When peeled put them into hot butter and let them 
heat thoroughly through — too much cooking toughens 
them. Season well with butter, pepper, and salt. Serve 
on buttered toast ; a teaspoon of wine or vinegar on each 
mushroom is a choice method. 



BAKING POWDEB. 166 

BAKING POV/DER 



Is a convenience which the chemistry of the nineteenth 
century has given to the cook ; its uses are indicated in 
the foUowing pages ; a question is sometimes asked as to 
the healthfulness of Baking Powder, it may be replied 
that a good Cream Tartar baking powder will, not only 
not injure the most delicate constitution, but may prove 
in many cases highly beneficial, whilst those in which 
Lime phosphates and Alum are used should be avoided. 

To be certain of its composition the cook might prepare 
her own baking powder ; it is, however, confessedly diffi- 
cult to obtain pure ingredients for this purpose at retail, 
no article being more generally found adulterated than 
Cream of Tartar, it is, therefore, safest to purchase the 
powder of a respectable maker who procures his supplies 
on a large scale, from places of production, and can test 
their purity. 

In using baking powder, the proper proportion should, 
in every case, be mixed intimately and uniformly with 
the dry flour, if shortening is to be used, it, also, should 
be mixed with the flour before wetting, the best powders 
give ample time for kneading, etc., but some — those usinor 
Tartaric Acid for instance — require expeditious use, else 
their efiect will be lost from the too rapid production of 

gas- , 

Unlike yeast, which changes to some extent the nature 
of all the flour used in a batch, and entirely destroys a 
portion of it, for the production of gas, baking powder 
leaves the flour quite unchanged, there is, therefore, no 
danger from yeast spores, which may have escaped alive 
from insufiicient baking, obtaining access to the stomach ; 
these latter are the cause of pains and eructations which 
frequently follow the use of warm yeast bread.

CUSTARD PIE. 

Mrs. £. E. Marcy. 

Make a custard of the yolks of three eggs with milk, 
season to the taste, bake it in ordinary crust ; put it in 
a brick oven, that the crust may not be heavy, and as 
soon as that is heated remove it to a place in the oven 
of a more moderate heat, that the custard may bake 
slowly and not curdle ; when done, beat the whites to a 
froth ; add sugar and spread over the top, and return to 
the oven to brown slightly ; small pinch of salt added to 
a custard heightens the flavour ; a little soda in the crust 
prevents it from being heavy. Very nice.

sugar mixed together ; put in mould to cool ; when cool, 
but not cold, take the whites of the eggs beaten stiff, 
sweetened and flavoured, and float them on boiling milk 
for about one minute. Now take the gelatine from j^our 
muuld (instantly place the mould in cold water), and 
with a fork, beat up the gelatine that has become finn 
into hits, but not into liquid. Now take your mould and

FRUITS. 



" Fruit of all kinds, in coat 
Rough, or smooth rind, or bearded husk, or shell, 
She gathers tribute large, and on the board 
Heaps with unsparing hand." 

— Pabadise Lost. 

Bring me berries or such cooling fruit 
Ab the kind, hospitable woods provide. 

— COWPJBB. 

Fruit for preserving should be carefully selected 
removing all that are imperfect. They are in the best 
condition when not fully ripe, and as soon as possible 
after they are picked. Small fruit should not be 
allowed to stand over night after they are picked when 
they are to be preserved. Use only the finest sugar for 
preserving. When fruit is sealed in glass cans, wrap 
paper of two or three thicknesses around the cans. The 
chemical action of light will affect the quality of the 
preserves when perfectly air-tight. With this precau- 
tion, glass cans are preferable to any other for preserv- 
ing fruit. One-half a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
is a good rule for canned fruit, although many house- 
keepers use but one-quarter of a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. 

An excellent rule for canning the larger fruits, as 
peaches, pears, etc., is to place them in a steamer over 
a kettle of boiling water, laying first a cloth in the bot- 



TALUABLE RECIPES. 239 

torn of the steamer. Fill this with the fruit and cover 
tightly. Let them steam for fifteen minutes, or until 
they can be easily pierced with a fork (some fruits will 
require a longer time). Make a syrup of sugar of the right 
consistency. As the fruit m steamed, drop each for a 
moment in the syrup, then place in the cans, having 
each one half full of fruit, and then fill up with the hot 
syrup, then cover and seal. 

A SUGGESTION. 

For canning all large fruits, where no other method 
is given by contributors, the directions for canning large 
fruits are given in the recipe for Preserved Peaches. 
For canning all of the small fruits, follow the directions 
given in Preserved Cherries. They are both excellent. 
If less sugar is prefeiTed use one-quarter of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. The syrup should be pre- 
pared by adding a pint of water in your preserving ket- 
tle to each pound and a-half of sugar ; let it boil up 
gently and skim until perfectly clear, when it is ready 
for the fruit. 

SUGARED FRUITS. 

Beat the white of the egg just enough to break, then 
dip fine stems of cherries or currants into the egg and 
then into powdered sugar, and dry on a sieve. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Pare as many apples as you wish of some nice variety, 
neither sweet nor sour ; core them by using an apple- 



240 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

corer or a steel fork ; set them in biscuit tins and fill 
the cavities with sugar, a little butter, and some ground 
cinnamon, if you like ; set them in the oven and bake 
until done. 

BAKED PEARS. 

Place in a stone jar, first a layer of pears (without part- 
ing) ; then a layer of sugar, then pears, and so on until 
the jar is full. Then put in as much water as it will 
hold. Bake in oven three hours. 

QUINCE PRESERVE. 

Mrs. Bendelari. 

Pare, core, and quarter your fruit, then weigh it and 
allow an equal quantity of white sugar. Take the peel- 
ings and cores and put in a preserving kettle ; cover 
them with water and boil for half an hour ; then strain 
through a hair sieve and put the juice back into the 
kettle and boil the quinces in it a little at a time until 
they are tender ; lift out as they are done with a drainer 
and lay on a dish ; if the liquid seems scarce add more 
water. When all are done throw in the sugar and allow 
it to boil ten minutes before putting in the quinces ; let 
them boil until they change colour, say one hour and a 
quarter, on a slow fire ; while they are boiling occasion- 
ally slip a silver spoon under them to see that they do 
not burn, but on no account stir them. Have two fresh 
lemons cut in thin slices, and when the fruit is being put 
in jars lay a slice or two in each.

BAKED QUINCES. 

One dozen nice quinces, cored and "svell rnbbed. Put 
in baking pans, and fill the centre with pulverized sugar. 
Bake and serve cold, with or without cream. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Select peaches of fine quality and firm. If too ripe 
they are not likely to keep perfectly. Pare them and 
place them in a steamer over boiling water and cover 
tightly ; an earthen plate placed in the steamer under 
the fruit will preserve the juices, which afterwards may 
be strained and added to the syrup. Let them steam 
for fifteen minutes or until they can be easily pierced 
with a fork ; make a syrup of the first quality of sugar 
and as the fruit is steamed drop each peach into the 
syrup for a few seconds, then take out and place in the 
cans ; when the cans are full, pour over the fruit the hot 
syrup and seal immediately. Inexperienced house-wives 
will do well to remember that the syrup should be well 
skimmed before pouring over the fruit. We prefer the 
proportions of half a pound of sugar to a poimd of fruit 
for canning, although many excellent house-keepers use 
less. This rule is excellent for all of the large finiits — 
as pears, quinces, apples, etc. 

PRESERVED PLUMS. 

Jennie June. 

Allow to every pound of fruit three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar ; put into stone jars alternate layers of 
fruit and sugar, and place the jars in a moderately wana

oven. Let them remain there until the oven is cool. 
If prepared at tea time let them remain until morning ; 
then strain the juice from the plums, boil and clarify it, 
Remove the fruit carefully to glass or china jars, pour 
over the hot syrup and carefully cover with egg, tissue 
paper, or thick white paper pasted, or bladder tied 
closely down. 

PRESERVED PEARa 

Mrs. Midgley. 

To BIX pounds of pears, four pounds of sugar, two 
coffee cups of water, the juice of two lemons, and the 
rind of one, a handful of whole ginger ; boil all together 
for twenty minutes, then put in your pears and boil till 
soft, say about a quarter of an hour ; take them out and 
boil your syrup a little longer ; then put back your fruit 
and give it a boil ; bottle whilst hot ; add a little cochi- 
neal to give them a nice colour. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Jennie June. 

Stone the fruit, weigh it, and for every pound take 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar. First dissolve the 
suo-ar in water in the proportion of a pint of water to a 
pound and a-half of sugar ; then add the fruit and let it 
boil as fast as possible for half an hour, till it begins to 
jelly. As soon as it thickens put in pots, cover with 
brandied paper, next the fruit, and then cover closely 
from the air.

strain out the juice, and put a pound of white sugar to 
a pint of juice. Flavour to taste ; boil till a good 
jelly, then put into moulds. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Take seven pounds of ripe apples — such as are excel- 
lent boilers — and if the rind is red the colour of the jelly 
will be beautifully tinged ; cut the fruit in pieces, with- 
out peeling or extracting the cores, and only removing 
the stalks and the eyes ; add two quarts of water, and 
boil or bake till the whole is a pulp, which pour into a 
jelly bag, placed near the fire, (as the pulp thickens in 
cooling) ; add eight ounces of white or loaf sugar to each 
pint of the liquid, with the juice of a small lemon, and 
the peel cut very thin ; boil to a tolerably thick jelly, 
which may be ascertained by trying a little on a plate ; 
strain again through the bag or a piece of muslin, and 
run into moulds or pots. When cold lay a piece of tissue 
paper over, and put by in a dry place. This jelly will 
keep two or three years.

well buttered ; set it on a table, and begin at the bot- 
tom and stick on to this frame with the sugar a row of 
macaroons, kisses, or other ornamental articles, and 
continue till the whole is covered. When cold draw out 
the pasteboard form and set the pyramid in the centre 
of the table with a small bit of wax candle burning with- 
in, and it looks very beautiful. 

CUSTARD JELLY.

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Mrs. Midgley. 

Nine Seville oranges, three sweet oranges, four lemons 
cut across the grain as finely as possible ; place in a 
deep dish with four quarts of water ; let it stand thirty- 
six hours ; boil two hours, (water as well) ; then add 
eight pounds of crushed sugar ; boil one hour longer, or 
until you think it will jelly ; the addition of a wineglassful 
of spirits when nearly boiled has the effect of causing all 
impurities to rise to the surface, and clarifies the jelly. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Mrs. N. P. Inglehart. 

Take juicy apples, (Ramboes, if possible) ; take the 
stems and tops otf, and wash them nicely, then cut up 
into quarters and put cold water upon them, just enough 
to cover them ; boil them soft, afterward strain them 
through a jelly bag ; then take two pints at a time with 
two pounds of crushed sugar ; boil twenty minutes, then 
do the same with the other juice ; to be economical, pare 
and core the apples ; don't strain so close, but that you 
can, by adding a little more water, use the apples for 
sauce or pies.

TO PRESERVE QUINCES. 

Mrs. W. Arthurs. 

Pare, core, and quarter a peck of quinces, then weigh 
them ; put the parings, cores, and seeds into a preserving 
kettle, cover them with water, and boil slowly for twenty 
minutes ; then strain them, put the water back, and 
put in the quinces, a few at a time, and simmer them 
gently until tender, say five to ten minutes ; lay them on 
a dish ; when all are done add the sugar and a little warm 
water. Let them boil for a few minutes until clear, then 
put in all the quinces and boil them without stirring 
until they become a clear garnet, which will be about 
one hour. Have ready two lemons sliced thin and seeds 
taken out ; put them in a few minutes before taking off 
the fire. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Mrs. C. Wheeler. 

Take the currants when they first ripen ; pick them

from the stems and put them on the stove in a stone 
jar, bruising them with a wooden spoon ; then, when 
warm, squeeze through a coai-se cloth or flannel, and 
put the juice on in a new tin pan or porcelain kettle ; 
one quart of juice requires two pounds of sugar, or a 
pound to a pint ; boil fifteen minutes ; to be a nice 
colour the currants should not come in contact with 
iron spoons or tin dishes, unless new and bright ; should 
be madje quickly. It never fails to jelly good if the cur- 
rants are not too ripe. The same method for jam, only 
do not strain the currants, but mash them well Cur- 
rants should not be dead ripe for jelly or jam.

CANDY. 



** Sweets to the Sweet. 



In order to understand the secret of candy making, it 
will be necessary to understand the action of heat upon 
sugar. The first step in this process is the reduction of 
sugar to a syrup, which is done by adding water to 
sugar in the proportion of a pint and a-half of water to 
three and a-half pounds of sugar. When this boils up 
in the kettle we have simple syrup. A few more min- 
utes of boiling, reduces the water which holds the sugar 
in perfect solution. At this stage, if the syrup is al- 
lowed to cool, the candy crystallizes on the sides of the 
dish, and we have rock candy. If, instead of allowing 
it to cool at this point, we allow it to reach a higher de- 
gree of heat, we shall find, in putting a spoon into the 
syrup, when drawing it out a long thread of sugar 
will follow the spoon. It is to this point that coufec- 
tioners bring the syrup for the greater number of can- 
dies produced. The greatest skill is required on the 
part of the operator to push the boiling sugar to this 
point without allowing it to reach the caramel state, 
when it becomes bitter and dark and is no longer fit to 
use as a confection. The proportion of sugar and water 
for candy making will be three and one-half pounds of 
sugar to ane and one-half pints of water. To this add 
one teaspoon of cream of tartar, which will prevent tha 



260 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

tendency of the sugar to assume the granular condition. 
To test the candy, drop into cold water. When this 
becomes at once hard and brittle the vessel should be at 
once removed from the fire. Flat sticks are formed by 
pouring the candy into long fiat pans, and when cooling 
crease the mass, which will readily break into sticks 
when cold. To make round stick candy, when cool 
enough to handle and while warm enough to mould, roll 
into sticks with the hands. To colour candies, take 
small portions of the candy while cooling, and colour, 
then put together in strips and twist slightly. 

LEMON CANDY. 

Put into a kettle three and one-half pounds of sugar, 
one and one-half pints of water, and one teaspoon of 
cream of tartar. Let it boil until it becomes brittle 
when dropped in cold water ; when sufficiently done take 
ofi" the fire and pour in a shallow dish which has been 
greased with a little butter. When this has cooled so 
that it can be handled, add a teaspoon of tartaric acid 
and the same quantity of extract of lemon, and work 
them into the mass. The acid must be fine and free 
from lumps. Work this in until evenly distributed, and 
no more, as it will tend to destroy the transparency of 
the candy. This method may be used for preparing all 
other candies, as pine-apple, etc., using difierent 
flavours. 

CREAM CANDIES. 
Three and one-half pounds of sugar to one and one- 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 261 

lialf pints of water ; dissolve in the water before putting 
with the sugar one-quarter of an ounce of fine white 
gum arable, and when added to the sugar put in one tea- 
spoon of cream of tartar. The candy should not be 
boiled quite to the brittle stage. The proper degree can 
be ascertained if, when a small skimmer is put in and 
taken out, when blowing through the holes of the skim- 
mer, the melted sugar is forced through in feathery 
filaments : remove from the fire at this point and rub the 
syrup against the sides of the dish with an iron spoon- 
If it is to be a chocolate candy, add two ounces of choco- 
late finely sifted and such flavouring as you prefer, 
vanilla, rose, or orange. If you wish to make cocoanut 
candy, add this while soft and stir until cold. 

EVERTON TOFFEE. 

Mis3. Wyllie. 

Take one pound of treacle, the same quantity of moist 
sugar, half a pound of butter ; put them in a saucepan 
large enough to allow of fast boiling over a clear fire ; 
put in the butter first, and rub it well over the bottom 
of the saucepan, and add the treacle and sugar, stirring 
together gently with a knife; after it has boiled for 
about ten minutes ascertain if it is done by having 
ready a basin of cold wa^r, and drop a little of the 
mixture into it from the point of a knife; if it is 
sufficiently done, when you take it irom the water 
it will be quite crisp. Now prepare a lai'ge, shallow tin 
pan or dish rubbed all over with butter to prevent its 
adhering, and into this pour the tofi*ee from the sauce- 
pan to get it cold, when it can be easily removed.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING BREAD. 

In the composition of good bread, there are three im- 
portant requisites : Good- flour, good yeast, and strength 
to knead it welL Floui* should be white and dry, crumb- 
ling easily again after it is pressed in the hand. 

A very good method of ascertaining the quality of 
yeast wiU be to add a little flour to a very small quan- 
tity, setting it in a warm place. If in the course of ten 
or fifteen minutes it rises, it will do to use. 

When you make bread, first set the sponge with warm 
milk or water, keeping it in a warm place until quite 
light. Then mould this sponge, by adding flour into 
one large loaf, kneading it well. Set this to rise again, 
and then when sufficiently light mould it into smaller 
loaves, let it rise again, then bake. Care should be 
taken not to get the dough too stiff with flour ; it should 
be as soft as it can be tc knead well. To make bread

or biscuits a nice colour, wet the dough over top with 
water just before putting into the oven. Flour should 
always be sifted. 

YEAST. 

Mrs. E. S, Cheesebrongh. 

Put two tablespoons of hops in a muslin bag and boil 
them in three quarts of water for a few minutes ; have 
ready a quart of hot mashed potatoes, put in one cup of 
flour, one tablespoon of sugar, one of salt ; pour over 
the mixture the boiling hop water, strain through a col- 
ander, put a pint or less of fresh baker's yeast, or two 
cakes of yeast in while it is warm, and set it in a warm 
place to rise. This yeast will keep three or four weeks, 
if set in a cool place. In making it from time to time, 
use a bowl of the same to raise the fresh with. 

YEAST. 

Mrs. Mary Ludlam. 

Six good potatoes grated raw, a little hop tea, one 
quart of boiling water, three-fourths cup of brown sugar, 
one-half teaspoon of salt ; when cool, add yeast to rise > 
keep covered and in a cool place. 

BEST BAKING POWDER 

Mrs. Oliphant. 

Tartaric acid, four parts, by weight ; bicarbonate 
soda, five parts, by weight ; baked flour, nine parts, by 
weight. The flour should be absolutely dry. The tar- 
taric acid and the soda must also be dry, and pulverized

as fine as possible separately in a clean porcelain mor- 
tar. When thus prepared sift all together repeatedly 
till perfectly mixed ; then put into well-corked bottles, 
and use two teaspoonsful to each pint of flour. 

BOSTON BROWN BREAD. 

Mrs. Oliphant. 

To make one loaf : — Rye meal unsifted, half a pint ; 
Indian meal sifted, one pint ; sour milk, one pint ; mo- 
lasses, half a gilL Add a teaspoonful of salt, one tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in a little hot water; stir 
well, put in a greaesd pan, let it rise one hour, and 
steam four hours, 

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Mrs. Upham. 

At supper time take one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, 
same of soda, and one teaspoonful of white sugar ; over 
this pour one teacupf ul of boiling water, and add one 
cupful of cold water ; stir in three dessertspoonfuls of 
Indian meal and flour enough to make a thick batter, 
and cover tightly. In cold weather place it where it 
will be warm all night. In the morning place your 
bowl in a dish of water as hot as you can hold your finger 
in. Stir it often and thoroughly for an hour. Sift in a 
ten quart pan two-thirds full of flour, into it stir enough 
warm water, one tablespoonful of salt, and one-half tea- 
spoonful soda, to make a thin batter; then stir your 
yeast in thoroughly and place in a warm place, where 
no draughts of cold air will reach it. Let it rise to the 
top of pan. 



268 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

YEAST. 

Mrs. W. C. Harria. 

Boil in separate pans one-half cup of hops and two 
potatoes ; strain both liquids boiling hot on a large cup 
of flour, one spoon of salt, half cup of sugar, and a cup 
of 3'east. Pour it into a jug and set it in a cool place. 

GOOD YEAST. 

Mrs. Packard. 

Grate six good sized potatoes (raw) ; have ready a 
gallon of water in which has been well boiled three hand- 
fuls of hops ; stiain through a cloth or sieve, while boil- 
ing hot, over the potatoes, stirring until well cooked, or 
the mixture thickens like starch ; add one teacup of 
sugar, one-half cup of salt ; when sufficiently cool, one 
cup of good yeast. Let it stand until a thick foam rises 
upon the top. Care must be taken not to bottle too 
soon, or the bottles may burst. Use one coffee cup of 
yeast to six loaves of bread. If kept in a cool place this 
3'east will last a long time, and housekeepers need not 
fear having sour bread. 

YEAST FOR BREAD. 

Miss L. Stagman. 

Grate ten or twelve good sized raw potatoes in a col- 
ander and let the water drip off them, and then add 
three parts of a saucerful of flour to the potatoes, and 
thi-ee parts of a cup of sugar ; then boil a good pinch of 
hops twenty minutes and throw over all ; when luke^

spoonful of salt. This will keep three weeks. 

YEAST THAT WILL NOT SOUR 

Mrs. J. B. Adams.

one cup of brown sugar in a jar ; boil and strain the 
hops and pour into the jar. Add one cup of flour stirred 
smooth ; let it stand in a warm kitchen till it ferments. 
Add six potatoes boiled and mashed, and one cup of salt.

enough to knead. Work it on the board until it re- 
quires no more flour. K made at night the bread will

the morning. This quantity will make two large loaves. 
One-third of the lump may be taken for rolls, which can 
be made by working in butter the size of an egg. and 
setting aside to rise again ; when light the second time 
make out in oblong shapes ; cover them with a cloth and 
let them rise again. As soon as they break apart bake 
in a quick oven. They will not fail to be nice if they are 
baked as soon as they seam. This is the great secret of 
white, flaky rolls. Two or three potatoes will improve 
the bread. Good housekeepers always have flour sifted 
in readiness for use, and never use it in any other way. 

BREAD. 

M. E. B. Lynde. 

The sponge is made over night in the centre of a pan 
of flour, with milk and warm water and a cup of home- 
made hop and potato yeast to about four loaves. The 
yeast is put in when about half the flour and water are 
mixed, and then the remainder of the water is added 
and the sponge beaten with a wooden spoon for fifteen 
minutes and left to rise over night in a moderately warm 
place. La the morning, the bread-dough mixed and 
kneaded for half an hour, adding flour to make a stiff 
dough, and left to rise in a mass. It is then made into 
small loaves, being kneaded with as little flour as 
possible, and put in pans to rise the second time, all the 
while kept moderately warm and when light bake in a 
moderately hot oven. The important part of said recipe 
is the beating of the sponge fifteen minutes, as given.

SUGGESTIONS. 

lu making Cake, it is very desirable that the materials 
be of the finest quality. Sweet, fresh butter, eggs and 
good flour are the first essentials. The process of put- 
ting together is also quite an important feature, and 
where other methods are not given in this work by con- 
tributors, it would be well for the young housekeeper to 
observe the following direction : Never allow the butter 
to oil, but soften it by putting it in a moderately warm 
place before you commence other preparations for your 
cake ; then put it into an earthen dish (tin, if not new^ 
will discolour your cake as you stir it), and add your 
sugar ; beat the butter and sugar to a cream ; add the 
yolks of the eggs, then the milk, and lastly the beaten 
whites of the eggs and flour. Spices and liquors may 
be added after the yolks of the eggs are put in, and 
fruit should be put in with the flour. 

The oven should be pretty hot for small cakes, and 
moderate for larger. To ascertain if a large cake is suffi- 



296 THE HOME COOK BOOK. 

ciently baked, pierce it with a broom-straw through the 
centre ; if done, the straw will come out free from dough ; 
if not done, dough will adhere to the straw. Take it out 
of the tin about fifteen minutes after it is taken from the 
oven (not sooner), and do not turn it over on the top to 
cool. 

ICING. 

The following rules should be observed where boiled 
icing is not used : — 

Put the whites of your eggs in a shallow earthen dish, 
and allow, at least, a quarter of a pound or sixteen table- 
spoons of the finest white sugar for each egg. Take part 
of the sugar at first and sprinkle over the eggs ; beat them 
for about half an hour, stirring in gradually the rest of 
the sugar ; then add the flavour. If you use the juice of 
a lemon, allow more sugar. Tartaric acid and lemon juice 
whitens icing. It may be shaded a pretty pink with 
strawberry juice or cranberry syrup, or coloured yellow 
by putting the juice and rind of a lemon in a thick muslin 
bag and squeezing it hard into the eggs and sugar. 

If cake is well dredged with flour after baking, and 
then carefully wiped before the icing is put op., it will 
not run and can be spread more smoothly. Put frosting 
on to the cake in large spoonsful, commencing over the 
centre ; then spread it over the cake, using a large knife, 
dipping it occasionally in cold water. Dry the frosting 
on the cake in a cool, dry place. 

FROSTING. 

Mrs. Louise Dewey. 

One pint granulated sugar, moisten thoroughly with 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 297 

water sufficient to dissolve it when heated ; let it boil 
until it threads from the spoon, stirring often ; while the 
sugar is boiling, beat the whites of two eggs till they are 
firm ; then when thoroughly beaten, turn them into a 
deep dish, and when the sugar is boiled, turn it over the 
whites, beating all together rapidly untU of the right con- 
sistency to spread over the cake. Flavour with lemon if 
preferred. This is sufficient for two loaves. 

FROSTING FOR CAKE. 

Ella Guild. 

One cup frosting sugar, two tablespoons of water boiled 
together ; take it ofi" the stove and stir in the white of one 
egg beaten to a stiff froth ; stir all together well ; then 
frost your cake with it, and you will never want a nicer 
frosting than this. 

ICE CREAM ICING FOR WHITE CAKE. 

Mrs. P. B. Ayex. 

Two cups pulverized sugar boiled to a thick syrup ; 
add three teaspoons vanilla ; when cold, add the whites 
of two eggs well beaten, and flavoured with two teaspoons 
of citric acid. 

ICING. 

Mw. H. P. StowelL 

One ponnd pulverized sugar, pour over one tablespoon 
cold water, beat whites of three eggs a little, not to a 
stiff" froth ; add to the sugar and water ; put in a deep 
bowl ; place in a vessel of boiling water and heat. It

will become thin and clear, afterward begin to thicken: 
When it becomes quite thick remove from the fire and 
stir while it becomes cool till thick enough to spread 
with a knife. This will frost several ordinary sized 
cakes. 

CHOCOLATE FROSTING. 

Mrs. C. H. Wheeler. 

Whites of two eggs, one and one-half cups of fine sugar,

like any frosting.

TEA. 

When the water in the tea-kettle begins to boil, have 
ready a tin tea-steeper ; pour into the tea-steeper just a 
very little of the boiling water, and then put in tea, allow- 
ing one teaspoon of tea to each person. Pour over this 
boiling water until the steeper is little more than half 
full ; cover tightly and let it stand where it will keep hot, 
but not boil. Let the tea infuse for ten or fifteen minutes, 
and then pour into the tea urn, adding more boiling 
water, in the proportion of one cup of water for every tea- 
spoon of dry tea which has been infused. Have boiling 
water in a water pot, and weaken each cup of tea as 
desired. Do not use water for tea that has boiled long. 
Spring water is best for tea, and filtered water next best.

Roasting Coffee. — This process should be carefully 
watched and superintended. When the berry crackles

MISCELLANEOUS. 



LIME WATER. 

Mrs. K C Lynde. 

One of the most useful agents of household economy 
it rightly understood, is lime water. Its mode of prepa- 
ration is as follows : Put a stone of fresh unslacked lime 
about the size of a half-peck measure into a large stone 
jar qr unpainted pail, and pour over it slowly and care- 
fully, (so as not to slacken too rapidly,) a tea-kettle full 
(four gallons,) of hot water, and stir thoroughly ; let it 
settle, and then stir again two or three times in twenty- 
four honrs. Then bottle carefully, all that can be poured 
off in a dear and limpid state. 

Uses. — It is often sold by druggists as a remedy for 
children''s summer complaints, a teaspoon being a dose in 
a cup of milk, and when diarrhoea is caused by acidity of 
the stomach, it is an excellent remedy, and when put into 
milk gives no impleasant taste, but rather improves the 
flavour. 

When put into mUk that might curdle when heated, 
it will prevent its so doing, and can then be used for 
puddings and pies. A little stirred into cream or milk^ 
after a hot day or night, will prevent its turning when 
used for tea or coffee. 

It is unequalled in cleansing bottles or small milk 
vessels, or babies' nursing bottles, as it sweetens and 



35 4 THE HOME COOK BOOK, 

purifies without leaving an unpleasant odour or flavour 
A cupful, or even more, mixed in the sponge of bread 
or cakes made over night, will prevent it from souring.

These may be easily preserved and retain their natural 
tints, or nearly so, by either of the following methods : 
As they are gathered they may be laid between the leaves 
of a magazine until the book is full, and left with a light 
weight upon them untill the moisture of the leaves has 
been absorbed ; two or three thicknesses of paper should 
intervene between the leaves. If the leaves are large or 
in clusters, take newspapers, lay them on a shelf and use 
in the same manner as above. Then dip the leaves into 
melted wax (such as is used for moulding fruits, etc.,) into 
which you will have to put a few drops of turpentine and 
lay upon newspapers to harden perfectly. This will make 
the leaves pliable and natural, and gives sufficient gloss. 
Great care should be taken that the wax is of right tem- 
perature. This can be ascertained by the first leaf which 
is dipped in. Draw out gently over the pan both sides of 
the leaf and hold it up by the stem. If the wax is too 
hot the leaf will shrivel — if too cool it will harden in 

lumps on the leaf. ^ 

Another method is to iron each leaf with a middling 
hot iron until the moisture is all out of them. Are best 
without varnish. 

SKELETON LEAVES. 

Boil the leaves in equal parts of rain water and soft 
soap until you can separate the pulp from the skin ;

take them out into clear water ; lay the leaf to be cleaned 
on glass, the upper side of the leaf next to the glass ; 
then with a tooth brush remove all pulp and skin, turn 
the leaf aud repeat the process ; when thoroughly done 
put the leaf to bleach in this solution : One pound sal 
soda, dissolved in five pints rain water ; one-half pound 
chloride of lime, in three pints water ; allow twenty-four 
hours for the latter to dissolve. Strain out the sediment, 
and pour out the clear solution of lime into the solution 
of sal soda. The result will be a thick butter-milk solu- 
tion, otherwise the lime was not strong enough. Filter 
this until it is perr'ectiy clear. For leaves, use one part 
of solution to one part of water : for ferns, use the solu- 
tion full strength. When perfectly white, remove to clear 
water ; let stand for several hours, changing two or three 
times ; the last water should be a little blue ; float out on 
paper, press in books when nearly dry. In mounting use 
mucilage made of five parts of gum arable, three parts 
white sugar, two parts of starch ; add a very little water, 
boil and stir until thick and white. 



TO RESTORE FROZEN PLANTS. 

B. H. Knapp. 

As soon as discovered, pour cold water over the plant, 
wetting every leaf thoroughly. In a few moments it 
will be crystallized with a thick coating of ice. In this 
state place it in the dark, carefully covered with a news- 
paper. The ice will slowly melt, leaving the plant in ita 
original state of health.

FOR CRYSTALLIZING GRASS. 

Mrs. Ludlam. 

Take one and one-half pounds of rock alum, pour on 
three pints of boiling water ; when quite cool put into a 
wide-mouthed vessel, hang in your grasses, a few at a 
time. Do not let them get too heavy, or the stems will 
not support them. You may again heat alum and add 
more grasses. By adding a little colouring it will give 
variety. 

CAMPHOR ICE. 

Mrs. A. M. 

One ounce of lard, one ounce of spermaceti, one ounce 
of camphor, one ounce of almond oil, one-half cake of

E. A. Forsyth. 

Do not use soap, but put a tablespoonful of hartshorn 
into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and down 
until clean ; then dry with the brushes down, and they 
will be like new ones. If you do not have ammonia, use 
soda ; a teaspoonful dissolved in the water will do very

pounder, or any way to work thoroughly through tV« 
suds without rubbing on a board. Rinse well in h( b 
water. There is usually soap enough from the first suds 
to make the second soft ; if not, add a little soap and 
ammonia ; and after being put through the wringer, let 
two persons, standing opposite, pull them into shape ; 
dry in the sun. White flannels may be washed in the 
same way without shrinking. 



TO WASH WOOLLENS. 

E. A. Forsyth. 

To every pail of water, add one tablespoon of ammonia, 
and the same of beef gall ; wash out quickly and rinse 
in warm water, adding a very little beef gall to the 
water. This will remove spots from carpets, making 
them look fresh. ■*

E. A. Forsyth. 

Spread the carpet where you can use a brush ; take 
Irish potatoes and scrape them into a pail or tub of water, 
and let them stand over night, using one peck to clean a 
large carpet ; two pails of water is sufficient to let them 
stand in, and you can add more when ready to use ; add 
two ounces of beef gall and use with a brush, as to scrub 
a floor ; the particles of potato will help cleanse ; when 
dry, brush with a broom or stiff brush.

AN EXCELLENT HARD SOAP. 

Mrs. Kate Johnaon. 

Pour twelve quarts soft boiling water on two and one- 
half pounds of unslacked lime ; dissolve five pounds sal 
soda in twelve quarts soft hot water ; then mix and let 
them remain from twelve to twenty-four hours. Pour ofl 
all the clear fluid, being careful not to allow any of the 
sediment to run off ; boil three and one-half pounds clean 
grease and three or four ounces of resin in the above lye 
till the grease disappears ; pour into a box and let it stand 
a day to stiffen and then cut in bars. It is as well to put 
the lime in all the water and then add the soda. After 
pouring off the fluid, add two or three gallons of water 
and let it stand with the lime and soda dregs a day or two. 
This makes an excellent washing fluid to boil or soak the 
clothes in, with one pint to a boiler of water. 

CLEANING SILVER. 

Mrs. 0. L. Parker. 

Never put a particle of soap about your silver if you 
would have it retain its original lustre. When it wants 
polish, take a piece of soft leather and whiting and rub 
hard. The proprietor of one of the oldest silver estab- 
lishments in the city of Philadelphia says that house- 
keepers ruin their silver in soap suds, as it makes it look 

like pewter. 

POLISH FOR ZINC OR TIN. 

Mrs. Tho3. A. Hill. 

To three pints of water, add one ounce of nitric acid, 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 363 

two ounces of emery, and eight ounces of pumice stone ; 

shake well together. Any druggist will fill it for fifteen 

cents. 

STOVE POLISK 

Mrs. 0. L, Parker. 

Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine and applied 
in the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy, and more 
durable than when mixed with any other liquid. The 
turpentine prevents rust, and when put on an old rusty 
stove will make it look as well as new. 

TO EXTRACT INK 

To extract ink from cotton, silk, and woollen goods, 
saturate the spot with spirits of turpentine, and let it 
remain several hours ; then rub it between the hands. 
It will crumble away without injuring either the colour 
or texture of the article. 

TO TAKE INK OUT OF LINEN. 

Dip the spotted part in pure tallow, melted ; then wash 
out the tallow and the ink will disappear. 

PATENT SOAP. 

Mrs. Liidlam. 

Five pounds hard soap, one quart lye, one-fourth ounce 
pearl-ash ; place on the fire and stir well until the soap is 
dissolved ; add one-half pint spirits of turpentine, one gill 
spirits hartshorn, and stir well. It is then fit for use. 
The finest muslin may be put to soak in this suds, and if

left for a time will become beautifully white. A small 
portion of soap put into a little hot water, and a flannel 
cloth will save hard labour ; and a brush in cleaning 
paint. One who has tried it thinks it worth the price of the 
book. 

FOR BLEACHING COTTON CLOTH. 

Mrs. C. H. "Wheeler. 

One pound chloride of lime, dissolved and strained ; 
put in two or three pails of water ; thoroughly wet the 
cloth and leave it in over night ; then rinse well in two 
waters. This will also take out mildew, and is equally 
good for brown cotton or white that has become yellow 
from any cause, and will not injure the fabric 

TO REMOVE TAR. 

Rub well with clean lai d, afterwards wash with soap 
and warm -water. Apply this to either hands or clothing. 

JAVELLE WATER FOR MILDEW STAINS.

hour ; then remove the cloth where it can drain ; pour 
away the copperas water and take two ounces of prus- 
siate of potash in about two pails of water in the same 
vessel ; when it is well dissolved and hot, put in the cloth 
from the copperas water, stirring it thoroughly till it 
boils, one-half an hour, then remove the cloth ; add (with 
care and caution, on account of the spattering which 
ensues,) one tablespoon of oil of vitriol, and stir it well in 
the dye ; replace the cloth, stirring it briskly till it has 
boiled one-half an hour. Should be well rinsed and 
washed in clear water to prevent the dye from making it 
tender after colourinof. 

Yellow. — For five pounds of cloth dissolve one-half 
pound of sugar of lead in a tub of warm water and 
twelve ounces of bichromate of potash in another tub of 
cold water ; soak, rinse, and wring the cloth in the lead 
water first, then in the other, and from one to the other, 
till the right shade of colour is obtained. 

Orange. — Dip the yellow coloured cloth into strong 
lime water ; if it should not turn, boil it ; rinse all well. 

Greex, — Put your blue cloth in the yellow dye in the 
same manner as for colouring yellow. Old calico will 
take a darker shade of blue or green in the same dye 
with the white cloth.

application of the following remedy : Alum reduced to an 
impalpable powder, two drachms ; nitrous spirits of ether, 
ceven drachms ; mix and apply to the tooth. Tried with 
success. 

Grease from Cloth. — Grease can be removed from 
cloth by a paste of Fuller's earth and turpentine. This 
should be rubbed on the fabric until the turpentine has 
evaporated and a white powder produced. The latter can 
be brushed off, and the grease will have disappeared. 

To Mend China — Take a very thick solution of gum 
arable in water, and stir into it plaster of Paris until the 
mixture becomes of a proper consistency. Apply it with

broken in the same place. The whiteness of the cement 
renders it doubly valuable. 

How TO Core a Bone Felon. — Of all painful things 
can there be any so excmciatingly painful as a bone 
felon ? We know of none that the flesh is heir to, and, 
as this malady is quite frequent and the subject of much 
earnest consideration, we give the latest recipe for its 
cure, which is given by that high authority, the London 
Lancet : — " As soon as the pulsation which indicates the 
disease is felt, put directly over the spot a fly blister, 
about the size of your thumb nail, and let it remain for 
six hours, at the expiration of which time, directly under 
the surface of the blister, may be seen the felon, which 
can be instantly taken out with the point of a needle or 
a lancet."

How TO GET RID OF Flies. — A clergyman, writing from 
Ireland says : — " For three years I have lived in town, 
and during that time my sitting room has been free 
from flies, three or four only walking about my break- 
fast table, while all my neighbours' rooms were crowde 1. 
I often congratulated myself on my escape, but never 
knew the reason of it until two days ago. I then had 
occassion to move my goods to another house, while I 
remained on for two days longer. Among other things 
moved were two boxes of geraniums and calceolarias, 
which stood in my window, the latter always being open 
to its full extent top and bottom. The boxes were not 
gone half an hour before my room was as full of flies 
as those around me. This, to me, is a new discovery, 
and perhaps it may serve to encourage others in that 
which is always a source of pleasure, and which now 
proves also to be a source of comfort, viz., window 
gardening." 

Smallpox Remedy. — The following remedy a friend 
tried in Ohio in a case of confluent smallpox, when the 
doctor had little hope of saving the patient, and it saved 
the woman's life. The remedy is sure in scarlet fever. 
"I herewith append a recipe which has been used to 
my own knowledge in a hundred cases. It will prevent 
or cure the smallpox, even though the pittings are 
filling. When Jenner discovered cow-pox in England, 
the world of science hurled an avalanche of fame upon 
his head, and when the most scientific school of medi- 
cine in the world (that of Paris), published this panacea 
for the smallpox it passed unheeded. It is unfailing

as fate, and conquers in every instance. It is harmless 
when taken by a well person. It will also cure scarlet 
fever. Take snlphate of zinc, one grain ; fox glove 
(digitcUis), one grain ; half a teaspoon of water. When 
thoroughly mixed, add four ounces water. Take a 
spoonful every hour, and either disease will disappear 
in twelve hours. For a child, smaller doses, according 
to age." 

Fob HydbophoblI- — Franklin Dyer, a highly respec- 
table farmer of Galena, Kent County, Md, gives the 
following as a sure cure for the bite of a mad dog. He 
has tested it with most gratifying results : Elecampane 
is a plant well known and found in many gardens. Im- 
mediately after being bitten, take one and a-half ounces 
of the root of the plant, the green root is preferable; 
The dried, to be found in drug stores, will answer ; 
bruise it, put it in a pint of fresh mUk, boil down to half 
a pint, strain, and when cold drink it, fasting at least 
six hours afterwards. The next morning repeat the 
dose, fasting, iising two ounces of the root On the 
third morning, take another dose prepared as the last, 
and this wiU be sufficient After each dose, nothing to 
be eaten for at least six hours. I had a son who was 
bitten by a mad dog eighteen years ago, and four other 
children in the neighbourhood were also bitten. They 
took the above, and are now alive and welL I have 
known many who were cured. It is supposed that the 
joot contains a principle, which, being taken up by the 
blood in its circulation, counteracts or neutralizes the 
deadly effect of the vims of hydrophobia. I feel so

much confidence in this simple remedy that I am willing 
you should give my name in connection with this 
statement. 

For Felon. — Take common rock salt, as used for salt' 
ing down pork or beef, dry in an oven, then pound it 
fine and mix with spirits of turpentine in equal parts ; 
put it in a rag and wrap it around the parts afiected ; 
as it gets dry put on more, and in twenty-four hours you 
are cured. The felon will be dead. No harm to try it, 
as I have with success. 

Cure for Neuralgia. — A friend who suflTered horrible 
pains from neuralgia, hearing of a noted physician in 
Germany who invariably cured the disease, went to him, 
and was permanently cured after a short sojourn. The 
doctor gave him the remedy, which was nothing but a 
poultice and tea made from our common field thistle. The 
leaves are macerated and used as a poultice on the parts 
afiected, while a small quantity of the same is boiled down 
to the proportion of a quart to a pint, and a small wine 
glass of the decoction drank before each meal. Our friend 
says he has never known it to fail in giving relief, while 
in almost every case it has effected a cure. God gave 
herbs for the healing of the nations. 

Tincture of Iodine on Corns. — Dr. Bajis states that 
corns may be rapidly cured by the application of the 
Tincture of Iodine ; the corn disappearing in the coui-se 
of a few days, if touched with the Tincture several times 
a day. If the corn be situated between the toes, it should 
be covered with a piece of linen steeped in a mixture of 
the Tincture and Glycerine. — Mrs. C. Patterson. 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 377 

Flannels for Fomentation. — Fold the flannel the 
size to fit over a pot of boiling water, and cover with a 
lid ; in a few minutes it will be hotter than if wrung out 
of boiling water and yet dry at the comers ; roll it up 
covered, and convey quickly to the patient. — J. K. 
GiLMOUR. 

For Hoarseness. — Squeeze the juice of half a lemon 
in a pint bowl, add loaf sugar (two tablespoons), one full 
teaspoon of glycerine, and one full tablespoon of whiskey,; 
pour over this boiling hot water to nearly fill the bowl, 
and drink hot just before going to bed. 

For Sore Throat. — Cut slices of salt pork or fat 
bacon ; simmer a few moments in hot vinegar, and apply 
to throat as hot as possible. When this is taken off, as 
the throat is relieved, put around a bandage of soft flannel. 
A gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in 
water, is also excellent. To be used frequently. 

Healing Lotion. — One ounce glycerine, one ounce rose- 
water, ten drops carbolic acid. This preparation prevents 
and cures chapping of the skin, and at the same time 
bleaches it. It is also excellent for sore lips and gums. I 
consider it an indispensable adjunct to the toilet table. — 
Mrs. a. Yocum. 

To STOP Bleeding. — A handful of flour bound on the 
cut. — Mrs. A. M. 

To Prevent Contagion from Eruptive Diseases. — 
Keep constantly, in plates or saucei's, sliced raw onions 
in the sick room, if possible. As fast as they become

discoloured, replace by fresh ones. During any epidemic 
of skin diseases that are eruptive, onions, except those 
taken fresh from the earth, are unsafe, as they are pecu- 
liarly sensitive to disease. 

To Restore from Stroke of Lightning. — Shower 
with cold water for two hours ; if the patient does not 
show signs of life, put salt in the water, and continue to 
shower an hour longer. 

For Toothache. — Of powdered alum and fine salt, 
equal quantities ; apply to the tooth and it will give 
speedy relief. — Mrs. Bartlett. 

For Headache. — Pour a few drops of ether on one- 
half ounce of gum camphor and pulverize ; add to this 
an equal quantity of corbonate ammonia pulverized ; 
add twenty drops peppermint ; mix and put in an open- 
mouthed bottle and cork. — Mrs. A. M. Gibbs. 

Salve for Chilblains. — Fry out nicely a little mutton 
tallow ; into this, while melted, and after it is nicely 
strained, put an equal quantity of coal oil ; stir well 
together while it is cooling. 

To Remove Discolouration from Bruises. — Apply 
a cloth wrung out in very hot water, and renew frequently 
until the pain ceases. Or, apply raw beefsteak. 

Cure for Wasp Sting. — Apply a poultice of saleratus 
water and flour, and bind on the sting. Apply slices of 
raw onion for a bee sting. 

Cure for Summer Complaint. — Two ounces tincture 
rhubarb, one of paregoric, one-half of essence of pepper- 



VALUABLE RECIPES. 879 

mint, one-half of essence of annis, one-half of prepared 
chalk. Dose for adult, one teaspoon in a little water ; 
take as often as needed. — Mrs. L, Bradley. 

The best Deodorizer, — Use bromo-chloralum in the 
proportion of one tablespoon to eight of soft water ; dip 
cloths in this solution and hang in the rooms ; it will 
purify sick rooms of any foul smells. The surface of 
anything may be purified by washing well and then rub- 
bing over with a weakened solution of bromo-chloralum. 
A weak solution is excellent to rinse the mouth with 
often, when from any cause the breath is offensive. It 
is also an excellent wash for sores and wounds that have 
an offensive odour. 

To Destroy Bed Bugs. Moths, and Other Vermin. 
— Dissolve alum in hot water, making a very strong 
solution ; apply to furniture or crevices in the walls with 
paint brush. This is sui-e destruction to those noxious 
vermin, and invaluable because easily obtained, is perfect- 
ly safe to use, and leaves no unpleasant traces behind. 
When you suspect^moths have lodged in the borders of 
carpets, wet the edges of the carpets with a strong 
solution ; whenever it reaches them, it is certain death. 

How to Select Meats. — An English journal gives 
the following hints on this subject : — " Good and whole- 
some meat should be neither of a pale rosy or pink 
colour, nor of a deep purple. The first denotes the 
diseased condition, the last proves the animal has died 
» natural death. Good meat has more of a marble look, 



380 THE HOME CX)OK BOOK. 

in consequence of the branching of the veins which sur- 
round the adipose cells. The fat, especially of the inner 
organs, is alway firm and suety, and never moi^t, while 
in general the fat from diseased cattle is flabby and 
watery, and more often resembles jelly or boiled parch- 
ment. Wholesome meat will always show itself firm and 
elastic to the touch, and exhibit no dampness, while 
diseased meat will appear soft and moist, in fact often 
more wet, so that the liquid substances run out of the 
blood when pressed hard. Good meat has very little 
smell, while unsound meat has a disagreeable, cadaver- 
ous smell, and difiuses a certain medicinal odour. This 
can be distinctly proved by cutting the meat through 
with a knife and smelling the blade, or pouring warm 
water over it. Lastly, bad meat has the peculiarity that 
it shrinks considerably in the boiling : wholsome meat 
rather swells, and does not lose an ounce in weight"

(or, what is better, a ten-pound turkey, boiled and minced), and fifteen heada 
of celery, are enough for chicken salad for fifty guests ; one gallon of ice 
cream to every twenty guests ; one hundred and thirty sandwiches for one 
himdred guests ; and sbc to ten quarts of wine jelly for each hundred. For 
a company of twenty, allow three chickens for salad ; one hundred pickled
