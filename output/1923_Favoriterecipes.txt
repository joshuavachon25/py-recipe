O COOK BOOK 3 



FOREWORD 



We are all much interested in the subject with which 
this book so ably treats. It is vital to the comfort and hap- 
piness of man. As "Sis Mirandy" says, "Dey talks a lot 
'bout dis heah haylo of romance dat a man sees about a gal 
befo' he marries her. You believe me, when I tells you dat 
de man whut always sees his wife surrounded wid de smell 
of good cookin' is got dat haylo business cinched. You never 
hears of no fust-class cooks in de divorsch courts." 

We trust that this little volume, with its valuable sug- 
gestions on "good things to eat", may be a real helpful com- 
panion in the kitchen of many a home. 

We are perfectly aware of the fact that "man does not 
live by bread alone", and it is not the purpose of our good 
women to emphasize cooking as of first importance in either 
the church or the home. It is but a very necessary inci- 
dental in the great work of building real character and life. 

Our church believes in the full-orbed life In our pur- 
suit of great truths, of spiritual dynamic and of nobler ser- 
vice to our fellow-men, we are not forgetful of those things 
which give us finer social qualities and breadth of intellec- 
tual grasp. 

It is our prayer that as the years go by our church may 
be of increasing help and inspiration to all who come under 
its influence. 

E. A. THOMPSON, 

Minister.

How to Store Food 

The refrigerator should be 
* used for storing not only all 
the surplus of the prepared 
perishable foods, but also all 
such foods as are subject to at- 
tack by insect or microbic life. 
This includes all dried fruits and 
special prepared foods, fancy 
flours, etc. 

Drinking water should be 
placed, cool in large bottles and 
kept on the floor of the refrig- 
erator. Butter, lard, cream and 
milk should be kept on the 
lower shelf — tender vegetables 
and fruits on the upper shelf — 
meats, as well as other foods, 
on the intermediate shelves. 

For best results use ice the 
year around.

158 YOUNG WOMAN'S AUXILIARY 

BEVERAGES 

"I like a teacup, a little china teacup, 
Filled to the brim with good, strong tea ; 
I like another one, just like t'other one, 
To give to a friend who is fond of me." 

COFFEE (Percolator) 

Allow 1 rounded tablespoon of coffee to every cup of 
water. The cups of cold water are measured and poured into 
the lower part of the percolator ; the coffee in the upper part 
called the filter cup. Place the spreader plate in place, cover, 
and allow to percolate, until the water, which has changed 
from a light to a dark brown, has become foamy, or has the 
appearance of boiling. Remove from the heat at once and 
serve. Use ground but not pulverized coffee. 

FRENCH DRIP COFFEE 

Fine-ground coffee is placed in upper part of coffee pot 
between spreaders. Freshly boiling water is then poured 
over it and drains into the lower part of coffee pot. After- 
dinner coffee is made by pouring the liquid, which has filt- 
ered through the coffee into the lower receptacle, back 
through the coffee a second and sometimes a third time. 
Keep the lower part of coffee pot in boiling water so that the 
liquid will not become cool through the process. 

TEA (General Rule) 

1 teaspoon of tea to 1 cup of boiling water. 

Place the tea in a clean, dry, heated teapot. Have fresh 
water heating and when the boiling point is reached and the 
first bubbling begins, pour immediately over the tea. Allow 
to steep for 5 to 6 minutes, but never boil. 

If strong tea be desired it should be made with a larger, 
portion of tea — not a longer period of steeping.

AFTERWORD 



The Young Woman's Auxiliary of the Congregational 
church offers in co-operation with other women of the 
church, this collection of favorite recipes in the hope it may 
contribute something toward the now popular movement 
for better homemaking. Each recipe has been conscientious- 
ly tested by the one whose name is attached and her reputa- 
tion is pledged to its excellence. 

Of necessity all duplicate recipes had to be eliminated.

spirit in place of the deed. And our advertisers, who have 
co-operated with us so generously, in making this book pos- 
sible, they deserve the confidence as they have the thanks 
of all who find merit in this volume.

"WTE CHIROPRACTORS work with the subtle substance of the 
^^ soul. We release the prisoned impulse, the tiny rivulet of 
force, that emanates from the mind and flows over the nerves to the 
cells and stirs them into life. We deal -with the magic power that 
transforms common food into living, loving thinking clay; that robes 
the earth with beauty, and hues and scents the flowers with the glory 
of the air. In the dim, dark, distant long ago, when the sun firs* 
bowed to the morning star, this power spoke and there was life; it 
quickened the slime of the sea and the dust of the earth and drove 
the cell to union with its fellows in countless living forms. Through 
aeons of time it finned the fish and winged the bird and fanged 
the beast. Endlessly it worked, evolving its foms until it produced 
the crowning glory of them all. With tireless energy it blows the 
bubble of each individual life and then silently, relentlessly dissolves 
the form, and absorbs the spirit into itself again. And yet you ask 
"Can Chiropractic cure appendicits or the 'flu'?" Have you more 
faith in a knife or a spoonful of medicine than in the power that an- 
imates the living world?
